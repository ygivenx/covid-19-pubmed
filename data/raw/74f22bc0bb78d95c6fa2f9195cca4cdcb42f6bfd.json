{"title": "Anchors Aweigh: Protein Traffic Mediated by Transmembrane Domains", "body": "cytosolic sorting determinants have received the most attention in the protein trafficking field, a number of studies over the past 25 years have shown that transmembrane domains (TMDs) also contribute to protein localization and transport.\n\nTransmembrane domains (TMDs) usually consist of a stretch of 17-25 (average 21) hydrophobic amino-acid residues [3] that are structured as an -helix [4] . A bioinformatics analysis of integral membrane proteins encoded in eukaryotic genomes revealed a strong correlation between the intracellular localization of the proteins and the exact length and amino-acid composition of their TMDs [5] . For instance, the TMDs of ER proteins were found to be shorter than those of plasma membrane proteins. Furthermore, the TMDs of plasma membrane proteins exhibit an asymmetric distribution of amino-acids along thehelix, with more valine and glycine residues toward the exofacial side and more leucine residues toward the endofacial side of the membrane [5] . In contrast, the TMDs of ER proteins do not display such asymmetry. These findings provided a global perspective on previous experimental analyses of the contribution of TMDs to various sorting events, including localization to the ER and the Golgi apparatus, endocytosis from the plasma membrane, transport from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), entry into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of multivesicular bodies (MVBs), and others ( Figure 1 ) ( Table  1 ). In this article we review the critical roles played by TMDs in intracellular sorting and discuss the mechanisms that have been proposed to explain TMD-mediated sorting.\n\nRetention of proteins in the ER was one of the first sorting processes found to depend on TMDs (Table 1) . Studies on the assembly and transport of hetero-oligomeric membrane complexes such as the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) (composed of eight type I transmembrane subunits, 2 2 ) showed that only fully assembled complexes reach the cell surface while unassembled subunits or partial complexes are retained in the ER [6, 7] . For some unassembled subunits, ER retention is followed by degradation [6, 7] through a ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD) [8] . Information leading to ER retention and ERAD targeting was mapped to the TMDs of the proteins [7] . The TMDs of TCR subunits are unusual in that they contain one or two charged residues (basic in the TCR-and -subunits; acidic in the CD3-, -, -and -subunits), which contribute to ER retention and ERAD targeting, as demonstrated by the fact that mutating them to hydrophobic residues disrupts both processes [7] . Moreover, simple placement of a charged or strongly polar residue (i.e., asparagine, glutamine) in the TMD of a reporter plasma membrane protein can confer localization to the ER and targeting to ERAD [9] . Whether strongly polar residues cause just ER retention or additional ERAD targeting depends on the nature of the residue and its position within the TMD. These outcomes are also dependent on the length of the TMD, with shorter TMDs enhancing and longer TMDs diminishing the effects of charged residues [10] . Similar to the TCR subunits, the -chain of the high affinity IgE receptor contains a charged residue [11] and the membrane IgM (mIgM) subunit of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) [8] contains a high number of polar residues (nine serine and threonine residues) that contribute to retention of the unassembled subunits in the ER. The TMDs of these proteins also mediate subunit interactions, such that subunit assembly abrogates ER retention and ERAD targeting [10] . By coupling oligomer assembly with export from the ER, the TMD-dependent sorting machinery participates in quality control, ensuring that only fully assembled complexes reach the plasma membrane.\n\nSimilar determinants account for the localization of ER-resident proteins and some viral envelope glycoproteins to the ER (Table 1) . For example, charged or hydrophilic residues in the TMDs contribute to ER localization of the cellular proteins cytochrome P450 2C1 [12] and p24 [13] , as well as envelope glycoproteins from Hepatitis C virus [14] and Dengue virus [15] . The shorter length of TMDs from UBC6 (17 residues) [16] also determines ER localization. Finally, the TMD of the ER chaperone Cosmc directs ER retention, although in this case it is by virtue of a cysteine residue that participates in disulfide-bonded dimerization [17] .\n\nTMDs are also a major determinant of protein localization to the Golgi apparatus, albeit often in cooperation with other topologic domains (Table 1 ). This role of TMDs was first demonstrated for the coronavirus E1 glycoprotein [18] and later found to apply to other viral envelope glycoproteins [15, 19, 20] . Additionally, TMDs contribute to Golgi localization of a large number of glycosylation enzymes that process the carbohydrate chains of newlysynthesized glycoproteins and glycolipids as they traverse the Golgi apparatus [21, 22] . Likewise, other Golgi proteins such as GOLPH2 [23] and Syntaxin 5 [24] depend on their TMDs for Golgi localization. Dissection of Golgi-localization determinants in these proteins revealed a requirement for hydrophilic, sulfhydryl and/or aromatic residues in the TMDs as well as a shorter-than-average length of the TMDs [24] [25] [26] [27] .\n\nThe role of TMDs in protein sorting is not limited to early compartments of the secretory pathway but also extends to the plasma membrane and endosomes (Table 1) . Rapid endocytosis of plasma membrane proteins is primarily mediated by endocytic signals encoded within the cytosolic domain [2] . However, alterations in the TMD can affect the rate of endocytosis. For example, placement of polar residues (i.e., threonine and glutamine) in the TMD of the transferrin receptor increases receptor internalization and reduces its recycling to the plasma membrane, contributing to its downregulation from the cell surface [28] . Similarly, shortening the TMD of a CD1b reporter protein from 21 to 18 residues promotes internalization through increased capture into clathrin-coated pits [29] . Endosomes are a major site of protein sorting from where transmembrane proteins can be routed for recycling to the plasma membrane or the TGN, or for delivery to lysosomes (or the yeast vacuole) via the MVB pathway. TMDs play roles in these endosomal routes as well [30] [31] [32] [33] . For instance, the 21-residue TMD of TGN38 promotes \"retrograde\" transport of this protein from early endosomes to the TGN; lengthening of the TGN38 TMD to 24 residues impairs this process [30] . In yeast, polar residues in the TMDs promote delivery of proteins from the TGN to endosomes, and then to ILVs, whereas more hydrophobic TMDs restrict proteins to the limiting membrane of MVBs [32, 33] . Finally, sorting of the influenza virus hemagglutinin from the TGN or endosomes to the apical plasma membrane domain of polarized epithelial cells is also determined by the protein's TMD [34] .\n\nRemarkably, TMD determinants that control sorting in different intracellular compartments share common properties. Shorter and more hydrophilic TMDs tend to localize proteins to early compartments of the secretory pathway (ER-Golgi) whereas longer and more hydrophobic TMDs favor localization to the plasma membrane. Similar but subtler differences influence sorting at the plasma membrane and in endosomes. Thus, proteins with short or hydrophilic TMDs are excluded from the cell surface first because they are retained in the ER and Golgi apparatus, and second because the fraction of these proteins that escape these early compartments is subsequently targeted to endosomal/lysosomal compartments. These experimentally-determined roles of TMDs in protein sorting are broadly in line with bioinformatic analyses which concluded that ER and Golgi proteins exhibit shorter TMDs than plasma membrane proteins, and that endosomal proteins may have TMDs of intermediate length [5] .\n\nOverall, these observations indicate that TMD sorting determinants are not conserved sequences or motifs but global properties such as length and hydrophilicity of the transmembrane spans. TMD length and hydrophilicity may actually be related properties, as the presence of polar residues in a TMD shortens the hydrophobic span and, reciprocally, shortening a TMD could force flanking polar residues into the membrane. Currently, it is unclear how the presence of other residues such as cysteine or the asymmetric distribution of residues along the TMD -helix influences sorting.\n\nBecause the sorting of TMDs largely relies on their global biophysical properties, two distinct sorting mechanisms have been proposed: recognition by transmembrane proteins that function as receptors or adaptors, and spontaneous partitioning into distinct membrane lipid domains. Evidence in favor of these two mechanisms at specific transport steps is discussed in the next sections.\n\nA study of fluorescently-tagged, C-terminally anchored proteins expressed in mammalian cells provided clues as to how TMDs might control sorting at ER exit sites [35] . This study showed that a protein with a short TMD localizes to ER cisternae but not to sites of ER exit for transport to the Golgi apparatus. In contrast, the same protein with a longer TMD is recruited to ER exit sites. The protein that does not enter ER exit sites has a high diffusion coefficient, excluding the possibility that this protein is immobilized by interaction with a putative ER matrix. The amenability of yeast to genetic analysis revealed that the transmembrane protein Erv14 acts as a receptor sorting long TMDs to ER-exit sites. Indeed, Erv14 was shown to interact specifically with proteins having long TMDs and to target them to COPII-coated vesicles that transport cargo from the ER to the Golgi apparatus ( Figure 2 ). Loss of Erv14 abrogated efficient transport of proteins with long TMDs to the cell surface. Another study uncovered receptor-mediated retrieval from the Golgi apparatus as another mechanism contributing to the TMD-dependent ER localization. Analysis of glycosylation patterns of proteins with short/hydrophilic TMDs in yeast showed that these proteins can gain access to early Golgi compartments, from where they are continuously and specifically retrieved back to the ER. Retrieval was found to be dependent on COPI, another protein coat involved in retrograde transport from the Golgi apparatus to the ER [36] . Screening for yeast mutants defective for ER localization of the transmembrane protein Sec12, which localizes to the ER by virtue of its TMD, identified a requirement for Rer1, a transmembrane protein that cycles between the Golgi apparatus and the ER [37] . These studies indicated that Sec12 is exported from the ER, but once in the Golgi apparatus, its TMD is recognized by Rer1. The Rer1 cytosolic domain in turn interacts with COPI, leading to retrieval of the Sec12-Rer1 complex to the ER [36, 38] . Interaction with Rer1 mediates ER localization of several other ER-resident proteins, such as Mns1 [39] and Sec71 [40] , as well as the unassembled Fet3 subunit of a reductive iron transporter [41] . Of note, these proteins have multiple TMDs, and it seems likely that Rer1 recognizes the folding status of the TMDs. In sum, Rer1 functions as a receptor that recognizes the TMDs of a subset of ER proteins, enabling their continuous retrieval to the ER by the COPI transport machinery ( Figure 3A) . The coordinate action of Erv14 and Rer1 ensures the efficient export of proteins with long TMDs from the ER and the retrieval of proteins with short TMDs to the ER, and is probably capable of recognizing more complex determinants such as the folding state of polytopic membrane proteins (Figure 2 ). Other receptors such as Gsf2 and Dip5 have also been proposed to mediate export of specific subsets of membrane proteins from the ER [42] .\n\nStudies in yeast have shown that the TMDs of some proteins can be recognized by transmembrane components of the ubiquitination machinery, leading to ubiquitin-dependent sorting of the proteins. In the ER, the presence of hydrophilic residues in the TMDs of misfolded or unassembled proteins can be detected by transmembrane ubiquitin ligases such as Hrd1 [43] , resulting in targeting to the ERAD pathway. A similar TMD recognition mechanism has been shown to mediate transport from the late Golgi apparatus to endosomes and then into ILVs. One study showed that targeting of the transmembrane vacuolar hydrolases carboxypeptidase S (Cps1) and polyphosphate phosphatase (Phm5) into ILVs depends on recognition of polar TMD residues by the transmembrane ubiquitin ligase Tul1 [44] . A later study revealed an alternative sorting mechanism involving recognition of polar TMD residues in Cps1 and Phm5a by the membrane protein Bsd2, which functions as an adaptor for the cytosolic ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 [45] (Figure 3B ). In both cases, recognition of polar residues in the TMD of a protein ultimately leads to ubiquitination of its cytosolic domain, a signal for targeting to ILVs by the MVB pathway [46] .\n\nThe physical properties of TMDs may also determine spontaneous partition of transmembrane proteins into different lipid domains. Minimizing exposure of hydrophobic groups to the aqueous environment is a driving force for assembly of cellular membranes, and consequently one might expect lipid bilayers and proteins with similar hydrophobic spans to segregate together. In principle, the length and hydrophobicity of TMDs could simply determine partitioning of the corresponding proteins into different membrane environments, with short/hydrophilic and long/hydrophobic TMDs promoting protein segregation to thinner and thicker membranes, respectively ( Figure 3C ). Indeed, electron microscopy of fixed cells has revealed a gradient of membrane thickness from the ER (thinner) to the plasma membrane (thicker) [47] . A study of synthetic transmembrane peptides embedded in reconstituted lipid bilayers provided experimental support for lipiddependent sorting: when short transmembrane peptides were inserted into reconstituted membranes, they segregated together with shorter lipids into discrete microdomains excluding long transmembrane peptides. Segregation was maximal when the mismatch between transmembrane peptide length and membrane thickness was highest. This lateral sorting occurred only in the presence of cholesterol which presumably straightened lipid acyl chains and increased the energetic cost of mixing peptides and lipids of different hydrophobic length [48] .\n\nAn affinity of some TMDs for specific lipids (e.g., cholesterol [49] ) could also drive partitioning into specific membrane microdomains. Indeed, membrane cholesterol content has also been shown to increase from the ER to the plasma membrane [50, 51] . More generally, membrane microdomains with specific lipid and protein composition (e.g., lipid rafts, caveolae) have been extensively studied [52] and segregation to such domains may also be linked to intracellular sorting and transport. A recent study has revealed the existence of multiple microdomains at the plasma membrane of yeast cells [53] , pointing to a much greater diversity of membrane domains than has been envisioned so far.\n\nAlthough the general principle of lipid partitioning provides a sound basis for explaining TMD-dependent protein localization, it remains to be established how this principle operates in living cells at specific transport steps. The relative contributions of protein-based and lipid-based mechanisms of TMD-dependent sorting are also unclear, although cooperation of both mechanisms is likely.\n\nThe studies reviewed here make it abundantly clear that TMDs play key roles in transmembrane protein sorting in the endomembrane system. Although the understanding of TMD sorting determinants has lagged behind that of cytosolic sorting signals, there is growing awareness that information in both topologic domains contributes to defining the precise location and traffic of transmembrane proteins within cells. The interplay between TMD and cytosolic determinants could take several forms. TMD and cytosolic determinants within the same protein could mediate different sorting steps (e.g., retention and retrieval). Alternatively, one determinant could influence the function of the other in the same sorting step. For example, TMD-dependent segregation into certain lipid domains or TMD-receptor interactions could change the oligomeric state of transmembrane proteins, thus modulating the avidity of cytosolic domains for protein coats.\n\nCompelling genetic evidence indicates that sorting by TMDs relies at least partly on proteinprotein interactions within membranes. To date, the argument in favor of lipid partitioning of TMDs is based on less direct evidence, and its relative importance in intracellular sorting of TMDs remains to be established. Our understanding of protein-based and lipid-based mechanisms of TMD-mediated sorting is far from complete and does not rule out less conventional explanations. For example, proteins like Rer1 may not function strictly as sorting receptors but rather organize lipid domains into which proteins partition for recycling to the ER. Likewise, loose networks of TMD interactions could mediate lateral segregation of transmembrane proteins leading to partitioning of a whole group of proteins into a lipid domain.\n\nThe role of TMDs in specific sorting events is but one of many processes that are known to involve molecular recognition within lipid bilayers. The function of intramembrane chaperones such as BAP31 [54] , proteases such as presenilins [55] and viral accessory proteins such as HIV-1 Vpu [56] also rely on substrate recognition via TMDs. A detailed understanding of all of these processes will require more extensive genetic and proteomic analysis, as well as the development of more powerful methods for examining the behavior of proteins in lipid environments. For example, X-ray crystallography and NMR [57] are beginning to provide insights into how TMDs interact among themselves and with structural lipids (i.e., those that are tightly associated with proteins). Mass spectrometry [58] as well as fluorescence spectroscopy and imaging techniques [59, 60] are also shedding new light into protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions in the membrane. Application of these methods to the problem of TMD-mediated sorting should contribute to answering several key questions: How do various TMDs interact among themselves and with lipids? Does binding of specific structural lipids (e.g., cholesterol, sphingomyelin) to TMDs confer partitioning into specific lipid microdomains? How do interactions between luminal and cytosolic domains influence TMD-TMD and TMD-lipid interactions? How do post-translational modifications such as palmitoylation [43] modulate TMD-mediated sorting? Addressing these questions will expand our understanding of molecular recognition events that take place in the hydrophobic milieu of membranes, bringing it up to par with the detailed knowledge of the mechanisms of signal-recognition in the aqueous environment of the cytosol. Schematic representation of intracellular transport pathways (arrows) and processes in which TMDs participate in protein sorting (yellow boxes). Newly-synthesized transmembrane proteins can be transported from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus, from where they return to the ER (ER-Golgi recycling) or continue on to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and the plasma membrane (PM) (secretory pathway). The ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) may play a role in both anterograde and retrograde transport steps. In polarized epithelial cells, the plasma membrane is specialized in apical and basolateral domains to which proteins are differentially sorted (polarized sorting). Plasma membrane proteins can be internalized into endosomes (endocytosis) from where they can return to the plasma membrane via the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) (endocytic recycling), undergo transport to the TGN via the tubular endosomal network (TEN) (retrograde transport) or to late endosomes/multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and then to lysosomes (lysosomal transport). In multivesicular bodies, proteins can either remain in the limiting membrane or be transported into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) (MVB pathway). Some proteins cycle between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes (TGNendosome recycling).\n\nTo be expressed at the cell surface, membrane proteins must be transported along the secretory pathway from the ER to the Golgi apparatus and then to the plasma membrane (green arrow). In the early steps of the secretory pathway, TMDs are recognized at least at two distinct sites. During the formation of COPII-coated vesicles, ER proteins with long TMDs are concentrated in budding vesicles due to their interaction with Erv14, and are thus efficiently transported to the cis-Golgi apparatus and beyond. In contrast, proteins with short TMDs are bound by Rer1 in the cis-Golgi and concentrated in retrograde COPI-coated vesicles destined for the ER (red arrow). These two systems, probably in concert with partitioning into different lipid domains, ensure efficient transport of proteins with long TMDs along the secretory pathway and localization of proteins with short TMDs to the ER. This model assumes that both Erv14 and Rer1 bind their targets in a regulated manner, in order to capture them in one compartment (e.g. ER for Erv14) and release them in another one (e.g., Golgi for Erv14) before returning to their original location, but the mechanisms involved are not known. This simplified scheme also does not depict other putative sorting receptors involved in export of distinct subsets of membrane proteins from the ER. (C) Lipid partitioning. In reconstituted lipid bilayers, short TMDs segregate into thinner membrane domains while long TMDs are found in thicker membranes. In living cells, a similar mechanism coupled to the formation of transport vesicles may ensure differential transport of transmembrane proteins.
