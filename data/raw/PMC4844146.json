Please see the corrected Table 1 here.\n\nThere is an incorrect reference to Table 1 in the second sentence of the first paragraph the Results section, \u201cORF1ab.\u201d The correct sentence is: The Seed stock had iSNVs present at nts 307\u2013313, part of the nsp1 ORF (residues 9\u201311). All iSNVs were detected at 4% indicating there is a second genotype present at 4%.\n\nThe incorrect value reported in Table 1 also appears in the first sentence of the Results section, \u201cORF5.\u201d The correct sentence is An iSNV resulting in a stop codon at residue 107 was detected in 12% of reads at nt 27162 for camel C2D5, the only sample for which there was adequate coverage at this site (>100x, S2 Table)."}
