{"title": "", "body": "Toy and miniature breeds seem particularly prone to HOE, especially toy and miniature poodles and schnauzers, but the syndrome may affect any breed. 4 \n\n1. What is the most common clinical sign of an esophageal disorder?\n\nRegurgitation.\n\n2. What is the difference between regurgitation and reflux? Regurgitation refers to passive, retrograde movement of ingested material to a level proximal to the upper esophageal sphincter; usually this material has not reached the stomach. In most cases, regurgitation results from abnormal esophageal peristalsis, esophageal obstruction, or asynchronous function of the gastroesophageal junction.\n\nReflux refers to the movement of gastric and duodenal contents into the esophagus without associated eructation or vomiting. 7. How is esophageal motility evaluated? Thoracic radiography initially evaluates for evidence of an esophageal foreign body, esophageal dilatation, or thoracic mass. Ideally a barium esophagograrn with fluoroscopy should be performed. It is best to mix food with the barium to observe for decreased contractility.\n\nMyasthenia gravis is an immune-mediated disorder, either acquired or congenital (familial), resulting from the action of autoantibodies against nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junctions. 9. What are the most common clinical signs of myasthenia gravis?\n\n\u2022 \u2022 Edrophonium response test. Edrophonium (0.1--0.2 mg/kg IV) results in dramatic improvement in gait for 1-2 minutes in many but not all animals. Pretreatment with atropine (0.02 mglkg IV) decreases salivation, defecation, urination, bronchosecretion, and bronchoconstriction. Oxygen and an endotracheal tube should be readily available. \u2022 Ten percent or greater decremental response to the fourth or fifth compound action potential recorded from the interosseous muscle after repetitive stimulation of the tibia or ulnar nerve at 3 Hz. \u2022 Increase in jitter on single-fiber electromyography.\n\n\u2022 Intercostal muscle biopsy identifying acetylcholine receptor antibodies at the neuromuscular junction.\n\n12. Describe the typical profile of a dog with myasthenia gravis.\n\n\u2022 Breeds most commonly affected: golden retriever, German shepherd \u2022 Bimodal age of onset: 2-4 years and 9-13 years 13. How is myasthenia gravis treated? "}
