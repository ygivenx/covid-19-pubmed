{"title": "The Infectious Bronchitis Virus Coronavirus Envelope Protein Alters Golgi pH to Protect Spike Protein and Promote Release of Infectious Virus", "body": "The majority of human coronaviruses (CoVs) cause mild disease phenotypes. However, when novel coronaviruses like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV emerge from their animal reservoirs to infect humans they elicit a robust and aberrant immune response that can lead to a very serious and deadly pneumonia (1) (2) (3) . Importantly, there are no effective vaccines or therapeutics to treat these CoVs. Efforts to develop long-term therapeutic strategies to combat novel, highly pathogenic CoVs will be aided by increased understanding of conserved viral mechanisms at the level of their cell and molecular biology.\n\nOne of the more fascinating and relatively enigmatic aspects of CoV biology is that CoV virions bud into the lumen of the secretory pathway at the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) , and then must navigate through the Golgi and the anterograde endomembrane system to be efficiently released from the host cell. It has been demonstrated that the structure and function of the Golgi depends upon an acidic pH gradient that decreases from the lumen of the cis-Golgi to the lumen of the trans-Golgi. This pH gradient is produced by a balance maintained by proton influx into the lumen of the Golgi, proton leak, and counter-ion conductance (4) . Pharmacological manipulations of the pH gradient, resulting in neutralization of the lumen, have all been shown to cause slow trafficking of cargo through the Golgi as well as alteration in Golgi morphology (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . A class of small viral membrane proteins with ion channel activity, called viroporins, have been shown to have dramatic effects on the secretory pathway, similar to those elicited by pharmacological manipulation of luminal pH (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) .Several well-studied members of this viroporin family of proteins include the Influenza A M2 protein (IAV M2), hepatitis C virus (HCV) p7 protein, and the CoV envelope (E) protein. These representative viroporins demonstrate several common functional features despite differences in viral assembly and budding locations. It has been suggested the role of M2 in the secretory .

Overexpression of M2 causes secretory pathway disruption where the rate of intracellular trafficking is slowed and Golgi morphology is altered (8). HCV p7 is also thought to play a protective role by allowing egress of viral structural proteins through the secretory pathway. HCV can be partially rescued by both pharmacological neutralization of the luminal spaces by bafilomycin A1 and by in trans expression of IAV M2 (9, 10) . Similar to M2, the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) coronavirus E protein elicits multiple secretory pathway disruption phenotypes when overexpressed in mammalian cells.\n\nTo understand CoV E at a cell biological level, a recombinant virus system was used to The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/440628 doi: bioRxiv preprint 5 IBV E or EG3 reduces trafficking rates of both membrane and secretory cargo (23). Given that release of infectious IBV EG3 is reduced, it was surprising that wild-type E protein reduced cargo trafficking. It was hypothesized that since the HD was required, alteration of the lumen by E ion channel activity was required for maintaining intact virus, and the reduced rates of trafficking were an acceptable compromise for the virus.\n\nStudies probing the nature of CoV E ion channel activity have centered on understanding the residues required for this activity and the associated pathogenic and cell biological phenotypes elicited by different CoV E proteins. Two residues in the HD of SARS-CoV E, N15 and V25, have been shown to promote viral fitness during infection (11, 21) .\n\nMutation of N15 or V25 abolishes ion-channel activity of SARS-CoV E in artificial membranes (11, 21) . We previously reported that the E protein of IBV is expressed in mammalian cells is found in two pools by velocity gradient analysis: a low molecular weight pool (LMW) and a high molecular weight pool (HMW) (26). The LMW pool represents IBV E in a monomeric state while the HMW pool correlates with a homo-oligomer of IBV E. When mutations corresponding to the conserved HD residues of SARS-CoV E that inhibit ion channel activity were made in IBV E (T16A and A26F), we found that the HD mutants segregated primarily into one oligomeric pool or the other. The E T16A mutant was primarily in the HMW pool while the E A26F mutant was found primarily in the LMW pool. The presence of the LMW pool of IBV E, the predominant and likely monomeric form found when E A26F is present, correlates with the secretory pathway disruption associated with the WT IBV E protein (26). This was surprising in that it suggested an E ion channel-independent role for IBV E associated with manipulation of the secretory pathway. It was recently reported that that these HD mutants do abolish ion channel activity of IBV E in artificial membranes, and virus titers are reduced by a log in the supernatant of infected cells, suggesting a defect in virion release (27). Our data on the IBV-EG3 virus corroborates this study (23).\n\n.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/440628 doi: bioRxiv preprint 6 Herein, we provide evidence for the neutralization of the Golgi during IBV infection and we demonstrate that transient over-expression of the IBV E protein, but not HD mutants deficient in the LMW pool of IBV E, is sufficient to cause a significant increase in the pH of the Golgi lumen. We suggest that increased trafficking and aberrant cleavage of the IBV S protein observed during IBV EG3 infection may reflect the detrimental effect of normal pH on IBV S processing. We demonstrate that IBV S processing and trafficking is similarly aberrant when coexpressed with EG3 but not WT E, and that IAV M2 can substitute for WT E to protect S from premature cleavage.\n\nGiven that the effects of IBV E overexpression on the Golgi are similar to those in cells where the luminal pH is neutralized, we first measured luminal pH in IBV-infected cells. We used flow cytometric analysis of a ratiometric pHluorin molecule targeted to the Golgi with a reporter consisting of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) pHluorin molecule fused to the membrane targeting sequence of the TGN38 trans-Golgi network resident protein (28) . We chose to use the trans-Golgi network pHluorin because the TGN is the most acidic compartment of the Golgi and thus any alteration in pH would likely be most detectable in this compartment. We generated a clonal Vero cell line that stably expressed the TGN38-pHluorin ( Figure 1A ). The generation of this cell line allowed us to ensure that all infected cells were expressing the TGN38-pHluorin. The cells were treated with cycloheximide for 60 minutes to chase newly synthesized TGN38-pHluorin from the ER. To generate a pH calibration curve, cells expressing the Golgi pHluorin molecule were subjected to treatment with buffers ranging from pH 5.5 to 7.5 in the presence of the ionophores monensin and nigericin prior to flow analysis ( Figure 1B) . The emission ratios of the biphasic pH-sensitive pHluorin at these known pH values can then be used to predict the Golgi luminal pH in cells The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/440628 doi: bioRxiv preprint infected with IBV in buffer at physiological pH and lacking ionophores ( Figure 1C ). Infection resulted in a robust increase in the Golgi luminal pH.\n\nWe attempted to measure the Golgi luminal pH in cells infected with IBV-EG3, but were unable to achieve a high percent of infected cells in the absence of syncytium formation, since this virus is not efficiently released and spreads best by cell-cell fusion. We found that syncytia were fragile, and this precluded flow cytometric analysis. Instead we turned to transfected cells to determine if the E protein could neutralize the Golgi lumen.\n\nTo determine if the pH change in infected cells was caused by the E protein, HeLa cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding IBV E along with the pHlorin-TGN38 reporter. We used transient transfection of the reporter here to ensure the pHluorin expressing cells were also expressing the E protein. In separate cells, we included vector alone and a plasmid encoding IBV M (as another overexpressed Golgi membrane protein) as controls. As described above, transfected cells were pretreated with cycloheximde for 60 min to chase newly synthesized pHlorin-TGN38 out of the ER. A standard curve was produced in cells treated with ionophores in calibrated pH buffers. As shown in Figs 2B and C, IBV E neutralized the trans-Golgi luminal pH when over expressed in HeLa cells, whereas the IBV M protein did not.\n\nTo determine the role of IBV E oligomerization in the alteration of Golgi luminal pH, we analyzed two HD point mutants of IBV E that segregate into different oligomeric states. Our previous findings suggest that IBV E A26F is found predominantly in the LMW, likely monomeric form, and IBV E T16A is found predominantly in the HMW, higher-order oligomer (26). In addition, we analyzed the EG3 mutant of IBV E, in which the entire HD of IBV E was replaced by a heterologous HD sequence. Both IBV E T16A and IBV EG3 had pH measurements similar to the IBV M membrane protein control .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/440628 doi: bioRxiv preprint (pH 6.95 and pH 6.87, respectively), while IBV E A26F elicited a robust pH increase similar to that of the wild-type IBV E protein (pH 7.18, Figure 3A .) This suggested that the LMW pool of IBV E correlates with the luminal pH increase of the Golgi in addition to the secretory pathway disruption demonstrated in our previous work (23, 26, 29). The same experiment was performed with a medial-Golgi pHluorin, GnT1-pHluorin (Gnt1, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I), to assess if the alteration in pH was specific to the TGN. Indeed, both IBV E and IBV E A26F elicited a robust pH increase ( Figure 3B ). Interesting, IBV E T16A increased the pH significantly, though not as robustly as IBV E and IBV E A26F . We found that the pH of the trans-Golgi (measured with TGN38-pHluorin) was higher than the medial-Golgi (measured with GnT1-pHluorin). This was unexpected and is addressed in the discussion. The results in transfected cells implicate the monomeric form of IBV E in neutralization of the Golgi lumen during infection and transfection.\n\nAttempts to rescue IBV EG3 by manipulation of Golgi pH. Despite intense efforts we were unable to conclusively determine whether an increase in Golgi pH could rescue the deficiencies of the IBV EG3 virus. We tried drugs that neutralize acidic compartments (baflinomycin A1, monensin and ammonium chloride), as well as overexpression of influenza A M2, a pH activated proton channel (4). However, the drugs inhibited exocytosis at all concentrations used (during short or long infections), and, we were unable to obtain a high percentage of M2transfected cells that were subsequently infected with IBV-EG3. In several experiments where the percent of transfected and infected cells was greater than 40%, we obtained 40-75% increases in release of infectious IBV-EG3 virus, but most experiments failed to show a reasonable overlap of transfection and infection and rescue of IBV-EG3 infectivity (data not shown). Additionally, attempts to make stable lines expressing M2 and pHluorin did not yield lines expressing M2 at a high enough level to alter the Golgi pH. We thus turned to another approach to assess the role of neutralization of the Golgi by IBV E during infection.

The IBV S protein is cleaved by a furin-like protease generating the S1 and S2 subunits during trafficking through the Golgi, and at a second site (S2') that primes the protein for fusion with the host cell (30) .The S protein of IBV-EG3 is subject to further proteolysis near the junction of the protein with the viral envelope, resulting in a C-terminal fragment we term the 'stub' (22). We predicted that neutralization of Golgi pH by IBV E during infection protects the IBV S protein from premature proteolysis at the normal acidic pH of the trans-Golgi. We also The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/440628 doi: bioRxiv preprint presence of M2 were also observed at the cell surface, though the differences were not significant. Values for the TGN38-pHluorin in different cell types range from pH 6.2-6.7 (28, 31, 32) . We believe that the slightly higher baseline measurement we observed is likely due to some plasma membrane cycling of the TGN38-pHluorin, which would increase the average pH in a given cell since the pH of the extra cellular buffer was pH 7.3. The cycling of TGN38-pHlorin is likely to be the predominant reason for a higher than expected TGN pH, since the medial-Golgi pHluorin reported a pH of ~6.4. We believe that the consistent shift in the Golgi pH in cells expressing IBV E is more important than the actual baseline pH value we observed with the TGN38-pHlorin. Previously, the TGN38-pHluorin construct was used to demonstrate that However, the IBV E T16A or IBV EG3 HD mutants did not cause a statistically significant shift (0.20 and 0.12 pH units, respectively). We previously showed that the LMW pool of IBV E correlates with the secretory pathway disruption, including Golgi disassembly and slow trafficking of model cargo proteins, observed when the wild-type IBV E protein is expressed (23, 29) . We hypothesized that the Golgi disruption was likely occurring in an IBV E ion channelindependent manner (26, 29). This study corroborates our hypothesis and suggests that the that proteolytic processing at two cleavage sites (S1/S2 and S2') releases the protein from its prefusion conformation and allows for a conformational change that exposes the fusion peptide (33) . This change in conformation may also release the S1 subunits from The S2 subunits of the CoV S trimer (33) . A possible detrimental consequence of the normal acidic Golgi pH to the virus could be that the S protein is subject to a conformational change and premature and possibly excessive proteolytic processing, resulting in release of the S1 subunit prior to receptor binding. This would result in noninfectious or impaired virions. Here we demonstrate that when IBV S is overexpressed in cells in the presence of EG3, the levels of IBV S cleavage species are increased significantly as compared to IBV S in the presence of IBV E or IAV M2, lending support to the hypothesis that the neutralization of Golgi pH by IBV E protects IBV S from premature cleavage. Additionally, when over expressed in cells IBV S is present to a greater extent at the cell surface, corroborating previous data observed during IBV EG3 infection (23).\n\nWhat is striking about IBV E when compared to M2 or p7 is the notion that IBV E is likely causing secretory pathway disruption in an IBV E ion-channel independent way. If IBV E is acting as a monomer to elicit secretory pathway disruption and alter pH, interaction of IBV E with a host protein(s) or lipid(s) would be necessary.\n\nEvidence suggests that CoV E proteins interact with host cell proteins to influence pathogenicity. Interaction of SARS-CoV E with the PDZ (post-synaptic density protein-95/discs Large/zonula occludens-1) domain containing scaffolding protein, syntenin, and with the tight The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/440628 doi: bioRxiv preprint with the large amount of IBV E known to reside at the ERGIC could disrupt the pH directly or indirectly by interfering with normal secretion or architecture of the Golgi. In summary, studies addressing CoV E protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions, and the development of tools to evaluate ion-channel activity in vivo, will go a long way in elucidating the precise mechanisms of the multifunctional family of viroporin proteins.
