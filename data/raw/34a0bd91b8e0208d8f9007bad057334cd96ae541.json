{"title": "Speci\u00aec mucosal IgA immunity in turkey poults infected with turkey coronavirus", "body": "Turkey coronaviral enteritis is an acute and highly contagious disease (Nagaraja and Pomeroy, 1997) . Turkey poult enteritis associated with turkey coronaviral infection has contributed to signi\u00aecant economic losses for turkey producers in Indiana, North Carolina, and other states for the last several years and remained as a major threat to the turkey industry. Once the coronaviral enteritis is introduced into the areas with high concentrations of turkeys on a year-round basis, it is not easily eliminated and is encountered frequently in turkey poults (Nagaraja and Pomeroy, 1997) . Treatments of the disease are often unsuccessful and there are currently no effective vaccines or medications to prevent the disease.\n\nProtection against enteric infections is largely provided by the gastrointestinal immune system. Considerable efforts of developing vaccines to these infections have been made on strategies that may stimulate this compartment of the mucosal immune system. Animal studies have demonstrated that IgA Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 88 (2002) 57\u00b164 antibody responses induced in intestinal mucosal lymphoid tissues are of fundamental importance in protection against intestinal infection by transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (VanCott et al., 1993) or human rotavirus (Yuan et al., 1996) . Development of successful vaccines to these virus-induced diseases depends on understanding of the most ef\u00aecient means of inducing virus-speci\u00aec effector cells within gutassociated lymphoid tissue.\n\nThe assessment of intestinal immune responses has frequently relied on indirect measurements such as determination of speci\u00aec antibodies in serum. However, measurement of antibodies of the systemic immune system may not be a reliable indicator for local mucosal immunity. Due to the ease of sample collection, measurement of antibody in the saline extract of feces has been used to assess intestinal immune responses. However, the complicated components in the gastrointestinal tract may affect the measurement of antibodies in feces such as local antibody degradation by proteases and sialidases. Nevertheless, the above-mentioned methods cannot provide information about where in the intestinal tract the speci\u00aec antibody response occurs. Such information has speci\u00aec relevance for the development of control and prevention strategies against enteric pathogens.\n\nIntestinal segment culture has been successfully used for the measurement of mucosal antibody production in mouse (Khoury et al., 1994) and human (Losonsky et al., 1999) . Since the whole tissue sample is used, the mucosal microenvironment remains intact. The humoral (such as cytokines) and cellular (such as accessory cells) factors required to produce antibody responses in the local intestinal tract are present. The antibody responses detected by intestinal segment cultures were positively correlated with the numbers of antibody secreting cells enumerated by enzymelinked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) (Losonsky et al., 1999) . The intestinal segment culture had been used to evaluate candidate vaccines consisting of rotavirus primate strain RRV, bovine strain WC3, or reassortant viruses between these animal viruses and human rotaviruses (Khoury et al., 1994) .\n\nBecause turkey coronavirus (TCV) replicate only in mature villus epithelial cells in small intestine , protection against infection of TCV is likely mediated by immune responses active at the intestinal mucosal surface. However, due to shortage of immunological reagents and methods speci\u00aec for evaluation of turkey immunity, reports of intestinal mucosal immune responses in turkeys following exposure to TCVare limited. The antibodies to TCV in the intestine and bile were only qualitatively detected by immunodiffusion test (Nagaraja and Pomeroy, 1978) or a sandwich immuno\u00afuorescent antibody assay (IFA) (Nagaraja and Pomeroy, 1980) . The interactions between the kinetics and magnitudes of mucosal IgA antibody responses in turkeys and acute turkey coronaviral infection and subsequent recovery of affected turkeys from the infection are not completely understood. This study was undertaken to elucidate the kinetic and magnitudes of intestinal IgA antibody responses in turkey poults infected with TCV by intestinal segment cultures.\n\nTurkey eggs and 1-day-old turkey poults (British United Turkey of America, BUTA) of both sexes were obtained (Perdue Farm, Washington, IN). They were free of recognized pathogens for turkeys, including TCV. Turkey poults were housed in Horsfall-Bauer isolation units for 4 weeks and then transferred to isolated\u00afoor pens. Feed and water were provided ad libitum.\n\nTCV was isolated from intestines of 28-day-old turkey poults with outbreak of acute enteritis. Affected intestines were homogenized with 5-fold volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer, clari\u00aeed by centrifugation at 3000 \u00c2 g for 10 min, and \u00aeltered through 0.45 and 0.22 mm membrane \u00aelters (Millipore Products Division, Bedford, MA). Filtrates containing only TCV, but not other viruses, were examined by electron microscopy (EM) and immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) according to procedures previously described (Dea and Garzon, 1991) . For IEM, the turkey antisera speci\u00aec for TCV was provided by Dr. Y.M. Saif (The Ohio State University, Wooster, OH) (Yu et al., 2000; Loa et al., 2001) . Twenty-two days old embryonated turkey eggs were inoculated with 200 ml of the \u00aeltrate via amniotic sac route. Embryo intestines were harvested in 3 days. Harvested embryo intestines were processed and propagated serially as described above for \u00aeve passages. Intestines of TCV-infected turkey embryos in the \u00aefth passage were prepared as 20% suspension in PBS. The suspension was homogenized, clari\u00aeed, \u00aeltered as described above, and used as inoculum. The inoculum was also examined with EM and IEM to con\u00aerm the presence of only TCV. The titer of virus was determined by inoculation of the suspension at 10-fold dilutions into groups of \u00aeve 22-day-old embryonated turkey eggs. The 50% embryo infectious dose (EID 50 ) was calculated by the method of Reed and Muench (1938) . An inoculum containing 4 \u00c2 10 3 EID 50 /200 ml (Experiment 1) or 2 \u00c2 10 4 EID 50 /1 ml (Experiment 2) of TCV was prepared and used to experimentally infect turkey poults.\n\nTwo experiments were conducted with two separate hatches of turkey poults. Infection with TCV was con\u00aermed at 3 days post-infection (PI) by examination of intestines of \u00aeve turkey poults with IFA, histopathology, and EM in each experiment. For histopathology, intestines were \u00aexed in 10% phosphatebuffered formalin for overnight, processed, embedded, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For EM, intestinal contents were clari\u00aeed by centrifugation at 5000 \u00c2 g for 30 min at 4 8C. The clari\u00aeed samples were ultracentrifuged at 100 000 \u00c2 g for 2 h at 4 8C. Pellets were resuspended in distilled water, placed on 200-mesh formvar carbon-coated grid, and negatively stained with 2% of phosphotungstic acid, pH 6.5.\n\nTwenty 10-day-old turkey poults were orally inoculated with TCV-containing inoculum prepared as described previously. A control group of 20 agematched birds was sham-inoculated with sterile PBS buffer. Five birds were randomly selected from each group and necropsied at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks PI. Duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were collected from each bird. Intestinal segment cultures were performed on duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, respectively. TCV-speci\u00aec IgA antibody in the supernatants collected from duodenum, jejunum, or ileum cultures was determined by antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\n\nThirty 10-day-old turkey poults were orally inoculated with TCV-containing inoculum prepared as described previously. A control group of 30 agematched birds was sham-inoculated with sterile PBS buffer. Five birds were randomly selected from each group and necropsied at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9 weeks PI. Blood was drawn from each bird and the serum collected was stored at \u00c020 8C. Feces, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were collected from each bird. The presence of TCV in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum was examined by IFA. Intestinal segment cultures were performed on duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, respectively. TCV-speci\u00aec IgA antibody in serum, feces, and supernatants collected from duodenum, jejunum, or ileum cultures was determined by antibody-capture ELISA.\n\nThe IFA method for detection of TCV was described previously Loa et al., 2000) . Duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were frozen immediately, sectioned, and incubated with turkey antisera speci\u00aec for TCV (Dr. Y.M. Saif) at a dilution of 1:40 at room temperature (25 8C) for 30 min. Intestinal sections were incubated with\u00afuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated goat anti-turkey IgG H L antibodies (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) at a dilution of 1:40 at room temperature for 30 min. The intensity of positive IFA staining for TCV in the enterocytes was scored on a scale of 1 to 4 with 1 being no staining and 4 being the most intense staining. The distribution of positive IFA staining for TCV in the intestinal section was categorized into diffuse, multifocal, and focal and scored as 3, 2, and 1, respectively. The scores of intensity and distribution of positive IFA staining for TCV were added. The \u00aenal value indicated the overall positive IFA staining in a section, with higher value indicating more positive staining.\n\nThe culture system for the measurement of intestinal antibody was modi\u00aeed from previously published methods for mice (Khoury et al., 1994) and human (Losonsky et al., 1999) . A 0.5 cm long segment of duodenum was collected from the loop of duodenum adjacent to pancreas. A 0.5 cm long segment of jejunum adjacent to the Merckel's diverticulum was collected. A 0.5 cm long segment of ileum in between the ceca was collected. The intestinal segments from the different poults were collected from the same locations. Segments of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were collected under sterile conditions, opened longitudinally, and washed twice with calcium-and magnesium-free Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10 mM N-2-hydroxy-ethylpiperazine-N H -2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) and 50 mg/ml of gentamicin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Each intestinal segment was placed in individual wells of a sterile 6-well culture plate containing 4 ml of RPMI-1640 culture medium supplemented with 10 mM HEPES, 10% sterile turkey serum, 0.25 mg/ml of amphotericin B, 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 mg/ml of streptomycin, and 50 mg/ml of gentamicin. All intestinal segments were cultured for 5 days at 37 8C in an atmosphere of 95% O 2 to 5% CO 2 . The culture supernatants were collected from each well and stored at \u00c020 8C until used.\n\nPreparation of rabbit anti-turkey IgA antibodies was modi\u00aeed from previously described methods (Dohms et al., 1978; Beetham et al., 1993) . Turkey IgA was puri\u00aeed from turkey bile by Sephacryl S-200 sizeexclusion chromatography (Pharmacia, Peapack, NJ). Whole molecule IgA was reduced with 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) and alkylated with iodoacetamide (Sigma). Heavy and light chains were separated by Sephacryl S-100 size-exclusion chromatography. Antiserum to turkey IgA was generated in rabbits using the puri\u00aeed heavy chains as inoculums.\n\nThe ELISA method for detection of antibody to TCV was previously described (Loa et al., 2000) .\n\nSupernatants of intestinal segment cultures, feces, and serum samples at a dilution of 1:3, 1:15, and 1:40, respectively, were added at 100 ml per well. Rabbit anti-turkey IgA antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:1600 for supernatants of intestinal segment cultures and serum samples and 1:800 for fecal samples. Horseradish peroxidase (HRPO)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG H L antibodies (Sigma) were used at a dilution of 1:400.\n\nCalculated means from each group were compared by t-test with signi\u00aecance determined at p < 0:05. The correlations among antibody responses in duodenum, jejunum, or ileum segment cultures and durations of TCV in corresponding intestinal segments or antibody responses in serum were determined by Spearman's rank correlation test (McPherson, 2001) .\n\nThe infection of turkey poults with TCV was con-\u00aermed at 3 days PI. The intestines of turkey poults were positive for TCV antigen by IFA. The turkey poults had acute atrophic enteritis by histopathology (data not shown). Turkey coronaviral particles in the intestinal contents were observed by EM (data not shown).\n\nDuration of viral antigen in different locations of small intestine is shown in Fig. 1 . The presence of TCV in duodenum was apparent at 1 week PI as shown by high IFA score at 5.6. The IFA score for TCV antigen was markedly decreased to 1.4 at 2 weeks PI. Viral antigen was no longer detectable after 3 weeks PI. In jejunum and ileum, the IFA response to TCV was observed until 4 weeks PI. The scores of IFA response to TCV gradually declined from 7.0 at 1 week PI to 4.0 at 4 weeks PI in jejunum and from 6.2 at 1 week PI to 2.2 at 4 weeks PI in ileum. As in duodenum, the viral antigen was not detectable in jejunum or ileum by IFA at 6 and 9 weeks PI. Duodenum, jejunum, and ileum of non-infected control turkeys from each interval were negative for TCV.\n\nIt was previously reported that TCV antigen in duodenum was consistently detectable from 1 to 6 days PI and only occasionally found at 14 and 24 days PI by IFA method while the viral antigen in jejunum and ileum was evident until 28 days PI . Similar \u00aendings that shorter duration of TCV in duodenum than in jejunum or ileum were also obtained in this study. The viral load in jejunum was higher than that in ileum in both studies.\n\nVirus-speci\u00aec IgA antibodies in supernatant\u00afuids from intestinal segment cultures is shown in Fig. 2 (Experiment 1) and Fig. 3 (Experiment 2) . The IgA response in duodenum cultures gradually increased from 1 to 4 weeks PI and reached the peak at ELISA reading of 0.67 in Experiment 1 and 1.24 in Experiment 2. The response declined at 6 and 9 weeks PI with ELISA readings at 1.14 and 0.93, respectively, in Experiment 2. In jejunum cultures, the IgA response gradually increased from 1 to 3 weeks PI and reached the peak at ELISA reading of 0.56 and slightly decreased at 4 weeks PI with ELISA reading of 0.42 in Experiment 1. The IgA response gradually increased from 1 to 4 weeks PI and reached the peak at ELISA reading of 1.04 in Experiment 2. The response declined at 6 and 9 weeks PI with ELISA readings at 0.51 and 0.45, respectively, in Experiment 2. In ileum Fig. 1 . Duration of TCV in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum as determined by IFA. Turkey poults were orally infected with TCV at 10 days old. Intestinal segments of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were separately collected from turkeys of infected or uninfected control groups at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9 weeks PI, and the IFA scores for TCV were determined as described in Section 2. The error bars represent the standard error of \u00aeve samples. , and ileum (c) segment cultures as determined by an antibody-capture ELISA in Experiment 1. Turkey poults were orally infected with TCV at 10 days old. Intestinal segments of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were separately collected from turkeys of infected or uninfected control groups at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks PI and cultured. The virus-speci\u00aec IgA antibodies in the culture supernatants were assessed by ELISA. The error bars represent the standard error of \u00aeve samples. OD 450 optical density read at 450 nm. The signi\u00aecance of difference between infected and uninfected control groups is indicated at each time interval by asterisks ( \u00c3 p < 0:1; \u00c3\u00c3 p < 0:05). cultures, the IgA response gradually increased from 1 to 4 weeks PI and reached the peak at ELISA reading of 0.41 in Experiment 1 and 0.88 in Experiment 2. The response declined at 6 and 9 weeks PI with ELISA readings at 0.72 and 0.82, respectively, in Experiment 2. Virus-speci\u00aec IgA antibodies in supernatant\u00afuids from duodenum, jejunum, or ileum cultures of noninfected control groups were undetectable throughout the entire experiments. The virus-speci\u00aec IgA antibody responses in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum negatively correlated with the duration of TCV in the corresponding intestinal segments as determined by Spearman's rank correlation test in Experiment 2. The correlation coef\u00aecients were \u00c00.85 p 0:034, \u00c00.74 p 0:096, and \u00c00.75 p 0:084 between IgA antibody responses and duration of TCV in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, respectively.\n\nThese results revealed that local intestinal mucosal IgA antibodies was stimulated and reached the plateau in a similar fashion in different sites of intestine after infection with TCV. It was demonstrated that induction of virus-speci\u00aec IgA antibody responses in local mucosal tissue was related to replication of porcine coronavirus (VanCott et al., 1993) and rotavirus (Khoury et al., 1994) . The virus-speci\u00aec IgA antibody response seemed to decline faster in jejunum than in duodenum or ileum when the viral antigen is no longer detectable at 6 and 9 weeks PI. Given the much longer stretch of jejunum in comparison with duodenum or ileum in turkey, the faster decline of IgA response in jejunum may be due to random dispersion of virus-speci\u00aec antibody secreting cells in a much wider jejunum.\n\nThe IgA response in feces reached the peak at 3 weeks PI with ELISA reading of 0.69 in Experiment 2 (Fig. 4a) . The responses dramatically declined at 4 weeks PI with ELISA reading of 0.26 and no longer detectable at 6 and 9 weeks PI. Virus-speci\u00aec IgA antibodies in feces of non-infected control groups remained undetectable throughout the entire experiments. The virus-speci\u00aec IgA antibody responses in feces did not correlate with those of duodenum, jejunum, or ileum segment cultures. The lower level of virus-speci\u00aec IgA antibodies in feces than that in intestinal segment cultures suggested that intestinal segment culture is a more sensitive method for detection of virus-speci\u00aec IgA antibodies in intestinal mucosa. The appearance of accumulated IgA antibodies in feces was only detectable within a relatively , and ileum (c) fragment cultures as determined by an antibody-capture ELISA in Experiment 2. Turkey poults were orally infected with TCV at 10 days old. Intestinal segments of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were separately collected from turkeys of infected or uninfected control groups at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9 weeks PI and cultured. The virus-speci\u00aec IgA antibodies in the culture supernatants were assessed by ELISA. The error bars represent the standard error of \u00aeve samples. OD 450 optical density read at 450 nm. The signi\u00aecance of difference between infected and uninfected control groups is indicated at each time interval by asterisks ( \u00c3 p < 0:1; \u00c3\u00c3 p < 0:05). small window of time at 3 and 4 weeks PI and markedly declined thereafter. In addition, it is dif\u00aecult to determine where the accumulated virus-speci\u00aec IgA antibodies in feces were produced from which segment of the intestine.\n\nThe virus-speci\u00aec IgA antibodies in serum were initially detected at 1 week PI, gradually increased from 1 to 4 weeks PI and reached the peak at ELISA reading of 2.98 in Experiment 2 (Fig. 4b) . The response declined at 6 and 9 weeks PI with ELISA readings at 2.36 and 2.28, respectively. Virus-speci\u00aec IgA antibodies in serum of non-infected control groups remained undetectable throughout the entire experiments. The virus-speci\u00aec IgA antibody responses in serum positively correlated with those of duodenum coefficient 0:829; p 0:042, jejunum coefficient 0:829; p 0:042, and ileum coefficient 0:771; p 0:072 segment cultures. Intestinal mucosal immune responses are initiated by uptake of antigens from mucosa surfaces into lymphoid tissues located in the mucosa where speci\u00aec B cells are activated. The activated B cells may enter the circulation and migrate to local and distant mucosal tissues as well as systemic lymphoid tissues. In the target environments, terminal differentiation of the activated B cells occurs and the virus-speci\u00aec antibodies are produced. The result in this study suggested that IgA antibody response in sera of turkeys might serve as an indicator for IgA antibody response in the intestine after TCV infection.\n\nIn conclusion, the results in this study showed that intestinal segment culture is a useful method for Fig. 4 . Kinetics of virus-speci\u00aec IgA antibody responses in feces (a) or serum (b) as determined by an antibody-capture ELISA in Experiment 2. Turkey poults were orally infected with TCV at 10 days old. Feces or sera were collected from turkeys of infected or uninfected control groups at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9 weeks PI. Feces were diluted at 1:15 and sera were diluted at 1:40. The virus-speci\u00aec IgA antibodies in the fecal and serum samples were assessed by ELISA. The error bars represent the standard error of \u00aeve samples. OD 450 optical density read at 450 nm.

A reliable method for the measurement of local mucosal immune responses is crucial for the evaluation of local immune response to infections and the development of mucosa-based vaccines. Virus-speci\u00aec IgA antibody responses to TCV were induced in intestinal mucosa of turkey poults infected with TCV. These IgA antibody responses were negatively correlated with the presence of TCV in the infected intestines. The elicited local mucosal antibodies may have provided protective immunity for infected turkeys to recover from TCV infection."}
