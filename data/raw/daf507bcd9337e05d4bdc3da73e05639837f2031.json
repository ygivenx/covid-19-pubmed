{"title": "TLR5 participates in the TLR4 receptor complex and biases towards MyD88-dependent 1 signaling in environmental lung injury 2", "body": "Lung disease is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the US alone, over 44 15% of the population suffers from lung disease, at an annual cost of 120,000 deaths, and >$50 45 billion (1-3). Environmental lung injury, e.g. through inhaled lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or elevated 46 ozone (O3) levels, exacerbates lung disease (4-7). For example, household LPS levels are directly 47 associated with asthma symptoms and asthma-related health care utilization (7). Also, sound 48 epidemiological studies suggest that for every 10 parts-per-billion (ppb) increase in O3 levels there 49 is an associated mortality increase of 0.39-0. 87% (5, 8) . It is therefore imperative to understand 50 the mechanisms of environmentally induced lung injury. 51\n\nInnate immune activation is a major contributor to lung disease pathogenesis and 52 environmentally-induced exacerbations (9, 10). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) orchestrate the innate 53 immune response to lung injury by recognizing exogenous pathogen-or endogenous danger-54 associated molecular patterns. TLR4 is the prototypic receptor for LPS (11), which is found in 55 particulate-matter pollution and house dust (7, 12) and is a major contributor to sepsis-induced 56 lung injury (13, 14) . TLR4 also mediates inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness after O3 57 exposure (15), triggered by release of the endogenous sugar hyaluronan (16) . 58\n\nRegulation of TLR4 signaling is still incompletely understood. TLR4 can heterodimerize with other 59 TLR like TLR2 and TLR6 (17, 18) ; in these cases, the partner TLRs serve to expand the TLR4 60 ligand spectrum. However, until now there has not been evidence of TLR4 interaction with other 61 regulates the immune response to injury (22) (23) (24) . TLR5 plays an important role in immunity and 67 metabolism and has been implicated in processes as varied as asthma (24), antiviral defense 68 (25), ischemia-reperfusion injury (26, 27) , radiation-induced injury (22, 28) , and regulation of gut 69 immunity (23). Furthermore, known functional genetic polymorphisms in TLR5 are associated with 70 susceptibility to infections (29-31) and autoimmune disease (32). These findings suggest a 71 clinically relevant role of TLR5 in human immune regulation in the response to injury. 72\n\nWe show that TLR5 deficiency in mice significantly alters the in vivo response to TLR4 activators 73 LPS, hyaluronan and O3. Mechanistically, we show that after ultrapure LPS exposure, TLR5 co-74 immunoprecipitates with MyD88, TLR4 and LPS. The presence of TLR5 promotes formation of 75 the Myddosome, i.e. association of MyD88 and IRAK4, and biases TLR4 signaling towards the 76\n\nMyD88 pathway. Finally, we demonstrate that human carriers of a dominant-negative TLR5 allele 77 have decreased inflammatory response to O3 exposure in vivo and LPS exposure in vitro. Our 78 results thus suggest that TLR5 participates in TLR4 signaling and modulates environmental lung 79 injury in disease-relevant exposures that lead to TLR4 activation. 80\n\nThis article is a US Government work.

As expected, this led to substantial 84 lung inflammation in wildtype mice, which was ameliorated in the absence of TLR5 (Fig. 1A) . 85 TLR5 deficiency also ameliorated cellular influx and lung injury as evidenced by lung lavage 86 protein (Fig. 1B) . Furthermore, expression of inflammatory cytokines in the lung was significantly 87 ameliorated in Tlr5-deficient mice (Fig. 1C) . This was largely mirrored in a reduction of 88 inflammatory gene expression in the liver (Supplementary Fig. 1A ). To ensure that our results 89\n\nwere not affected by obesity-, microbiome-or breeding-related immune perturbations, we 90 performed experiments with mice that were either purchased from a commercial vendor (using 91 C57BL/6 as controls) or bred in our NIEHS colony (using wild-type littermates as controls) and 92 treated some mice with neomycin to reduce bacterial burden in the intestinal tract. Our results did 93 not vary regardless of mouse provenance or antibiotic treatment (Supplementary Fig. 1B) . 94\n\nTo determine if the TLR5 effect on TLR4 signaling has broader biological and clinical relevance 95 in the lung, we explored TLR5-mediated effects on sterile lung injury after exposure to the ambient 96 Hematoxylin-Eosin staining of lung sections demonstrates LPS-induced lung injury is ameliorated in Tlr5-deficient (TLR5 -/-) mice.

O3 exposure is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in human patients 97 with cardiopulmonary disease (5, 8); furthermore, it is now understood that TLR4 mediates the 98 development of inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) after O3 exposure (15). We 99 used an O3 dose that is equivalent to human exposure during a high-O3 day (33, 34). Tlr5-deficient 100 mice had ameliorated airway cytokine expression and almost abolished AHR after O3 exposure 101 ( Fig. 2A, B) . Because hyaluronan is the endogenous danger-associated molecular pattern that 102 activates TLR4 and mediates the response after O3 exposure (15, 16), we then investigated the 103 effect of TLR5 on hyaluronan signaling. Tlr5-deficient mice had substantially reduced 104 Figure 2. TLR5 deficiency ameliorates the in vivo inflammatory response to inhaled O3.

We showed that the presence or absence 111 of functional TLR5 is associated with differential regulation of immune genes in this panel. 112\n\nInterestingly, there was a linear correlation between the magnitude of the TLR5 effect and the 113 proportion of genes that are either published or predicted to be downstream of the NF\u03baB pathway 114 (Supplementary Figure 2C) : among the genes that were 70-90% upregulated in Tlr5-sufficient 115 mice compared to Tlr5-deficient mice, almost 90% were in the NF\u03baB pathway, while this 116 proportion fell to 50% among the genes that were no different between genotypes. (R 2 =0.89, 117 p=0.0013). This suggested to us that TLR5 may preferentially impact gene expression 118 downstream of MyD88 activation. In aggregate, these results support that TLR5 promotes TLR4 119 signaling in several models of TLR4 activation through pathogen-or danger-associated molecular 120 patterns (PAMPs or DAMPs, i.e. LPS or hyaluronan respectively) and promotes TLR4-mediated 121 inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness in vivo. 122 123 Genetic TLR5 deficiency in humans impacts TLR4 signaling in vitro and ex vivo. 124\n\nWe then investigated the effect of TLR5 in human TLR4 signaling. In humans, a dominant-125 negative TLR5 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs5744168, TLR5 392STOP ) (29) is found with 126 a prevalence of 8-10% in Caucasians and 3% in African Americans. We hypothesized that carriers 127 of this SNP may have reduced TLR4-mediated inflammation. We used the Environmental 128\n\nPolymorphisms Registry (35), a NIEHS-supported cohort, to recruit carriers of this allele, as well 129 as \"wildtype\" controls. Others have reported that whole blood from rs5744168 minor-allele carriers 130\n\ndoes not differ in the response to LPS compared to \"wildtype\" (31), and we confirmed this finding 131 (Supplemental Figure 3A) . We believe this happens because whole blood consists of different 132 This article is a US Government work.

This 137\n\nwas not due to altered expression of TLR4 or CD14, which was not changed by the rs5744168 138 genotype (Supplemental Figure 3C) . 139\n\nWe then investigated the effect of TLR5 in O3-induced inflammation in healthy human volunteers. 140\n\nWe exposed human volunteers to O3, and isolated alveolar macrophages through bronchoscopy 141 24 hours after exposure, which represents the peak of O3-induced inflammation and symptoms 142 in humans. TLR5 expression was modestly increased in alveolar macrophages of human 143 volunteers after O3 exposure (Fig. 4B , p=0.05 by Wilcoxon pairwise signed rank test). There was 144 no association between TLR5 expression and TLR4 expression after O3 exposure. We found, that 145\n\nTNF\u03b1 expression by alveolar macrophages after O3 exposure was not increased in any of the 146 TLR5-deficient individuals (rs5744168 minor-allele carriers), while it was increased in wildtype-147 allele carriers ( Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig.3D) . 148 149 TLR5 modulates TLR4-dependent signaling. 150\n\nTo investigate the mechanistic role for TLR5 in the response to LPS-induced TLR4 activation, we 151 then compared primary bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) from Tlr5-deficient and -152 sufficient mice. Tlr5-deficient BMDM had significantly decreased expression of TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 153 after ultrapure LPS exposure in vitro, by an average of 30-50% (Fig. 5A) . To ensure that the 154 altered response was not due to LPS contaminants despite the ultrapure preparation, we also 155 assayed Tlr4-deficient BMDM and saw no response to ultrapure LPS (Fig. 5A) . The effect of Tlr5-156 deficiency was also observed when using other sources of Tlr4 activation, such as 157\n\nMonophosphoryl Lipid A (Supplementary Fig. 4A ). To ascertain that our observation was not 158 due to an off-target effect of genetic Tlr5 ablation on macrophage biology, we used RAW264.7 159 cells, a murine macrophage cell line, which are naturally deficient in Tlr5 (36).

The TLR5-dependent effect was specific to LPS exposure, as responses 163 to poly(I:C) (TLR3 ligand), Pam3CSK4 (TLR2 ligand), and ODN (TLR9 ligand) were not affected 164 by the presence of TLR5 (Fig. 5B) . 165 166 Figure 5 .

TLR4 signals through both MyD88 169 and TRIF pathways, whereas TLR5 signals through MyD88 only (11). We therefore hypothesized 170 that TLR5 may bias the signaling response towards the MyD88 pathway. We found that, in primary 171 murine BMDMs, MyD88 co-immunoprecipitated with TLR5 after ultrapure LPS exposure (Fig.  172   6A ).

TLR4, as expected, also immunoprecipitated with MyD88 174 after LPS exposure (Fig. 6B) . Furthermore, the association of MyD88 with TLR4 and TLR5 was 175 This article is a US Government work.

MyD88 signaling occurs through the complexing of Myd88 with IRAK-4 177 which stabilizes formation of the so-called Myddosome (37). Tlr5-deficient BMDM had decreased 178 immunoprecipitation of IRAK-4 with MyD88 (Fig. 6C) . There was also significant reduction in the 179 phosphorylation of IKK\u03b1/\u03b2, I\u03baB, p65, JNK1/2 and ERK1/2 in Tlr5-deficient BMDMs compared with 180 wildtype cells during early activation (Fig. 7A,B, Supplementary Fig. 4B) , which is MyD88-but 181 not TRIF-dependent (38, 39). Nuclear IRF3 (a specific readout of TRIF-dependent signaling (40)) 182\n\nwas not affected in Tlr5-deficient (Supplementary Fig. 4C ). In aggregate, these results suggest 183 that TLR5 directly interacts with MyD88 after LPS exposure and enhances MyD88-dependent 184 TLR4 signaling by promoting efficient assembly of Myddosome. 185 This article is a US Government work.

We first evaluated whether TLR5 affects TLR4 cell 189 surface expression and trafficking using bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) from 190 genetically deficient or wild-type mice. There were no differences in basal levels of cell surface 191 TLR4 or CD14 between Tlr5-deficient and -sufficient BMDM, nor in LPS-induced internalization 192 of TLR4 (Supplementary Fig. 5A-D) . Because we were unable to find commercially available 193 validated antibodies against TLR4 that could be used in co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we 194 utilized an induced expression system using tagged TLR4 and TLR5 in HEK293 cells and found 195 that TLR4 and TLR5 reciprocally co-immunoprecipitated in transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 8A) . 196\n\nProximity Ligation Assay (Supplementary Fig. 5E ).

Recent evidence highlights 205 the role of molecules of the TLR4 receptor complex in modulating TLR4 signaling. For example, 206 elegant work has demonstrated that CD14, which is necessary for LPS binding to TLR4, also 207 controls TLR4 endocytosis after LPS ligation, and thus is necessary for TRIF signaling, which is 208 thought to occur in the endosomal compartment (41). Our work further suggests that TLR4 209 signaling is modulated by the addition of TLR5 to the receptor complex. Unlike CD14, TLR5 does 210 not appear to regulate LPS-induced internalization of TLR4 (Supplementary Fig. 5C ). Our 211 findings rather support a model in which TLR5 selectively promotes TLR4/MyD88 signaling at the 212 plasma membrane and is not required for CD14 regulation of the TRIF pathway. Importantly, our 213 work suggests that TLR5 regulation of TLR4 signaling is biologically significant. TLR5-deficient 214 mice had approx. 30-50% decreased cytokine expression in local and systemic LPS models of 215 lung inflammation, while airway hyperresponsiveness after ozone or hyaluronan exposure was 216 significantly reduced, and inflammatory gene induction after hyaluronan exposure was abolished. 217\n\nIt is possible that the \"fine-tuning\", MyD88-promoting effects of TLR5 are particularly evident in 218 lower-grade inflammation such as ozone-or hyaluronan-induced, which explains the larger impact 219 on TLR5 deficiency on human and murine inflammation after ozone exposure compared to LPS 220\n\nUsing primary murine macrophages, we demonstrate that, in the physiological state, TLR5 co-222 immunoprecipitates with MyD88 after ultrapure LPS exposure, but only in the presence of TLR4. 223\n\nThis indicates that TLR5 is recruited into the Myddosome assembly, along with TLR4, upon TLR4 224 activation. Indeed, it has been postulated that the ability of the Myddosome to form 7:4 and 8:4 225\n\nMyD88:IRAK4 stoichiometries is a potential mechanism through which clusters of activated TLR 226 receptors can be formed and different TLR receptors can be recruited into the same assembly 227 This article is a US Government work.

Higher-order assembly of receptor complexes in lipid raft microdomains is likely to be crucial 228 in the fine-regulation of immune responses (37). Our work suggests that TLR5 may be part of the 229 higher-order receptor assembly that regulates TLR4 signaling. TLR4 is a promiscuous receptor, 230\n\nhaving been found to heterodimerize with TLR2 and TLR6 (17, 18) , but the effect of 231 heteromerization until now has always been to expand the TLR4 ligand spectrum. To our 232 knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate that TLR heteromerization may serve to modulate 233 canonical TLR signaling. 234\n\nA recent paper supported the role or TLR5 in TLR4 signaling, showing similar effects of the 235 rs5744168 minor allele polymorphism on TNF\u03b1 and IL-8 expression by human monocytes after 236 LPS exposure, and also demonstrating that TLR5 does not influence the gene expression of TLR4 237 (43), as we also show in our Supplemental Figure 5 . By contrast, that paper could not confirm 238 that TLR5 is modifying the NF\u03baB pathway. This apparent discrepancy may be due to different 239 research methodologies: These authors used gene silencing which only resulted in approx. 50% 240 reduction of TLR5 expression, as well as reporter cell lines with transfection-induced TLR5 241 expression, as opposed to our use of primary cells with genetically knocked-out gene function. 242\n\nFurthermore, the authors of that study did show an effect for TLR5 on NF\u03baB when transfecting 243 with lower (more physiological) doses of TLR5 DNA (43). 244\n\nThis article is a US Government work.

We propose that the hitherto accepted model 246 of TLR4 signaling through TRIF and MyD88 rather reflects the TLR5-deficient state. In TLR5-247 expressing cells, TLR5 participates in a heteromeric higher-order TLR4 receptor complex and 248 potentiates MyD88 signaling by promoting efficient assembly of the Myddosome. This also 249 suggests that exposures that induce TLR5 expression, such as DNA injury, p53 activation (21) This article is a US Government work.

Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 286 urethane (2 g/kg; Sigma), tracheotomized with a tracheal cannula (Harvard Apparatus) with Luer 287 adapter, and mechanically ventilated on a 42 \u00b0C water-heated pad at a rate of 150 breaths/min, 288 a tidal volume of 10 ml/kg and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 3 cm H2O with a 289\n\ncomputer-controlled small animal ventilator (FlexiVent, Scireq, Montreal, Canada). To block 290 spontaneous breathing, mice were given pancuronium bromide i.p. (0.8 mg/kg; Sigma-Aldrich) 291 5min prior to assessment of airway responses. To measure airway responsiveness, a single-292 frequency forced oscillation waveform, followed by a broadband forced oscillation waveform 293 (matched to the animal breathing frequency) were applied using the Flexiware 7.6 software 294 default mouse inhaled dose-response script. The resulting pressure, volume, and flow signals 295 were fit to either the Single Compartment or Constant Phase model of the lung to obtain total 296 respiratory system resistance (Rrs) and elastance (Ers) or Newtonian resistance (Rn, generally 297 understood as proximal airway resistance), tissue damping (G, generally understood as 298 peripheral tissue resistance), and tissue elastance (H), respectively(46).

The complete details of the human exposure studies and the subject characteristics were 364 previously published(47). After obtaining informed consent through a Duke University Institutional 365\n\nReview Board approved protocol, healthy human subjects were exposed to filtered air and ozone 366 (200 parts per billion) in a crossover challenge designed study. Exposures were for 135 minutes, 367 during which participants alternated between resting and walking on a treadmill at 2-3 mph to 368 mimic an individual performing mildly strenuous activity under ambient conditions. Ozone was 369 created from a 100% O2 source by cold plasma corona discharge (Ozotech, Yreka CA), and 370 mixed with filtered air before addition to chamber and was continuously monitored. The order of 371 filtered air or ozone exposure were randomized for every participant, with at least a 21-day 372 washout period. Approximately 20 hours after exposure, participants underwent a flexible 373 bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage. Following bronchial alveolar lavage, human alveolar 374 macrophages were isolated. After red cell lysis and counting, the macrophages were re-375 suspended in media (RPMI1640 with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 376 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin) and plated in a 24 well plate at a density of 200,000 cells per well. The cells 377\n\nwere maintained in a CO2 incubator at 37\u00ba C for 2 hours. After 2 hours, the media was replaced 378 to remove non-adherent cells and then 2 hours later, the supernatant was collected and the cells 379\n\nwere harvested for RNA. RNA extraction was performed using the Fourth Edition Qiagen Protocol 380 (Qiagen, RNeasy Mini Kit, 4th edition, Valencia, CA), followed by DNase treatment (DNase I, 381\n\nAmbion, Austin, TX) and cDNA synthesis (BioRad). RT-PCR was performed on an ABI SDS 7500 382 (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR Green Reagent (Clontec Laboratories Inc., Mountain View, 383 CA). TLR5 expression was determined in comparison to the 18-s RNA housekeeping gene and 384\n\nThis article is a US Government work.

Human TNF-\u03b1 was measured from the cell supernatants via 389 ELISA (MAX Standard Set kit, BioLegend) according to manufactures instructions. Readings were 390 taken using BMG LABTECH Omega (Software Version 1.20). In a second study, participants 391\n\nwere invited according to their rs5744168 genotype. Peripheral blood was drawn, and monocyte-392 derived macrophages isolated after 7 days in culture and exposed to ultrapure LPS or flagellin as 393 indicated. 394 395\n\nData are represented as mean \u00b1 s.e.m. and were analyzed depending on experimental design by 397 either analysis of variance (one-way or two-way ANOVA) followed by Tukey's post hoc test or by 398 unpaired t test with Welch's or Holm-Sidak correction as appropriate. Tlr5 gene expression and 399 TNF-\u03b1 production data from ozone expose human volunteer macrophages is presented as 400 individual values and analyzed by Wilcoxon pairwise signed rank test. 401\n\nAll clinical studies described in this work were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the 403 NIEHS and Duke University respectively.
