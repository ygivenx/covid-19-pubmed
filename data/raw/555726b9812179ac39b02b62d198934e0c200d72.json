{"title": "Evaluation of a polymerase chain reaction-electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry for the detection and subtyping of influenza viruses in respiratory specimens", "body": "Influenza viruses are responsible for winter epidemics among children and adults, with huge potential costs for society. 1 Influenza viruses are detected directly from respiratory samples. 2 That was originally done using cell cultures or direct antigen detection 3 but culture-based methods are time-consuming and direct antigen detection is not sensitive enough to provide a reliable diagnosis. Molecular diagnostics, which is globally the current standard technology, overcomes these limitations. 4 The majority of molecular approaches to influenza viruses detection are based upon real-time reverse-transcription PCR targeting the segment encoding the conserved matrix protein (M) gene segment. 5 Downstream assays can be used to type influenza A or B or further subtype influenza A. Some influenza A subtypes (H1N1pdm09, non-H1N1pdm09, H3N2, avian H5N1) can be detected using current molecular techniques that target hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). 6 However, it is still difficult to detect and identify emerging viruses with reassorted internal genes.\n\nNew technologies like the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-TOF-MS) should be able to identify these pathogens. The method was originally applied in microbiology, 7 for identifying species of bacteria in respiratory samples, 8 but it has also been used to identify viruses including coronavirus 9 and adenovirus. 10 PCR/ESI-TOF-MS technology has more recently been used to identify and characterize the recombinant influenza A H1N1pdm09 [11] [12] [13] [14] and to identify the origin of the gene segments of that reassortant virus of porcine, human and avian influenza viruses. 15, 16 The technique has also been independently evaluated for its ability to type influenza in retrospective nasopharyngeal specimens. 17 The present study is the first showing results of samples collected prospectively and compared to a multiplex reference method different from any previously published method.\n\nThis study evaluates the suitability of the PLEX-ID flu detection TM assay based upon a reverse-transcription (RT) coupled to PCR/ESI-TOF-MS, for detecting influenza viruses in prospective clinical respiratory samples and determining their subtypes.\n\nSamples tested with the multiplex RespiFinder kit \u00ae 18,19 were used as a reference for comparison and discrepant results were tested with a third RT-PCR multiplex molecular technique for confirmation of results.\n\nWe discriminated between H1N1pdm09 and non-H1N1pdm09 influenza A subtypes in a subpopulation of samples that were influenza A positive with the RespiFinder kit \u00ae using the RealTime ready Inf A/H1N1 Detection Set \u00ae . The results were compared to those obtained with the PLEX-ID Flu detection \u00ae assay.\n\nThe Department of Virology, CHU Toulouse, France, tested 293 respiratory samples prospectively collected during the 2010-2011 winter season when the Flu epidemic was on its peak. Of these, 148 were from the French Flu survey network and 145 were collected from children attending the Pediatric Unit of the Toulouse University Hospital.\n\nNasopharyngeal swab samples were collected on Virocult \u00ae swabs (Kitvia, Labarthe Inard, France) and stored at \u221280 \u00b1 5 \u2022 C.\n\nRespiratory samples were tested prospectively with the MLPA. Total nucleic acid was extracted with the MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Kit \u00ae (Roche) on the MagNA Pure LC TM instrument according to the manufacturer's instructions. Input sample volume was 200 l and output elution volume was 100 l (2-fold concentration).\n\nRespiratory viruses were detected with the RespiFinder \u00ae DC kit, which can detect 15 respiratory viruses: influenza virus type A, influenza virus type B, avian influenza virus A/H5N1, respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) A and B, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3 and 4, coronaviruses OC43, 229E and NL63, rhinovirus, adenovirus and human metapneumovirus.\n\nThe method is based on amplifying viral genomes with a multiplex RT-PCR. Its sensitivity is due to hybridization, ligation and PCR of the probe. The various amplicons are detected by size-fractionation on a capillary electrophoresis system with the sequencing analyzer ABI 3130 XLS (Applied Biosystems). The internal amplification control is an RNA transcript from the encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus: this checks for the presence of sample addition and the absence of PCR inhibitors.\n\nThe MLPA test does not differentiate between influenza A H1N1pdm09 and influenza A non-H1N1pdm09 viruses. The influenza type A viruses detected were subtyped by testing influenza A positive MagNA pure total nucleic acid extracts with the RealTime ready Inf A/H1N1 Detection Set \u00ae (Roche Diagnostics) employing the RNA virus master \u00ae one-step RT-PCR kit (Roche Diagnostics) according to manufacturer's instructions on the Light Cycler 480 TM system (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France). The set contained specific primer/probe mixes for detecting influenza A matrix protein 2 (M2) and the H1N1pdm09-specific hemagglutinin HA1 (H1) in a single reaction.\n\nRespiratory samples were analyzed with the PLEX-ID system (Abbott Molecular, IL, USA). RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs using the PLEX-ID Viral RNA Isolation Kit (Abbott Molecular, IL, USA) on the PLEX-ID FH and SP instruments in a fully automated manner. Input sample volume was 300 l and output elution volume was 200 l (1.5-fold concentration).\n\nThe PLEX-ID Fluid handler was used to distribute the nucleic acids and enzymes for PCR into the PLEX-ID Flu Detection plates. Viral nucleic acids were amplified using the PLEX-ID Flu Detection TM kit (Abbott Molecular, IL, USA). Segments of the influenza genome were amplified by PCR on the PLEX-ID TC (Mastercycler ProS-Eppendorf) using nine primer-pairs located at core conserved sites.\n\nThe regions targets are shown in Table 1 . The Pan-influenza-PB1 primer-pair detects all influenza viruses (A, B and C types). Primer-pairs targeting nucleoprotein (NP), matrix protein (M1), polymerase (PA), non-structural 1 (NS1) and polymerase basic 2 protein (PB2) gene segments were designed to amplify sequences of influenza A viruses only. Primer-pairs located on HA and NA glycoproteins were designed to amplify only influenza H1N1pdm09. A specific PB2 primer was selected to amplify influenza B in addition to the pan-influenza primer. The last well contained the PB2 and the influenza A-NA (N1-TFR) which covers the most common mutation (N1-TFR) associated with oseltamivir (Tamiflu) resistance (H275Y). 20, 21 Each amplicon is automatically desalted and purified on a weak anion exchanger. 22 Methanol-based aerosols containing denatured ionized amplicons are sprayed into the mass spectrometer. The time-of-flight to the detector is determined giving the mass of the amplicon. 12 By database analysis, the base composition (BC) of each PCR amplicon derived from each viral gene segment is determined. Influenza viruses are then typed and subtyped by bioinformatic analysis of the BC signatures produced by the nine target genes. The BC signatures are compared to known BC signatures in the reference database (Influenza Research Database, NCBI Influenza Virus Resource, Systems Influenza.org.) and viruses are identified by matching them to the closest signatures in the database.\n\nThe Anyplex TM II RV16 Detection kit (Seegene) was used as a third analytical technique for samples that gave discordant results. This multiplex RT-PCR test detects 16 viruses, including influenza A and B.\n\nData were analyzed using StatView 5.0 StataTM software (Stat-aCorp, Texas). The Kappa-Cohen test was used to compare assays. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant. The sensitivities (percentages of reactive samples) of these assays were compared using the McNemar's chi-squared test.

The mean age from those 148 from the French Flu survey network was 24.5 years and median was 16.9 years. The mean age from those 145 collected from children attending the Pediatric Unit of the Toulouse University Hospital was 1.6 years and the median was 0.4 years. The PLEX-ID TM and the RespiFinder \u00ae reference assay gave discrepant results for 19 samples. Of these, 7 were PLEX-ID TM positive and RespiFinder \u00ae negative. There were 5 influenza A: three H1N1 pdm09, one non-H1N1pdm09 and one H3N2 influenza A virus. Three of these samples were positive for RSV with the RespiFinder \u00ae DC kit assay and were collected from children attending the emergency unit. Twelve samples were PLEX ID TM negative and RespiFinder \u00ae positive: ten samples were influenza A positive and two were influenza B positive.\n\nWe determined the subtypes of 64 samples that tested positive for influenza A viruses with the RespiFinder \u00ae using the RealTime ready Inf A/H1N1 Detection Set \u00ae (Roche Molecular Diagnosis): 56 samples were H1N1pdm09 and eight were influenza A non-H1N1pdm09 viruses.\n\nWe compared these results to those obtained with the PLEX-ID TM Flu detection assay ( Table 3 ) and found that 61/64 samples gave concordant results (95.3%): 55 were H1N1pdm09 and 6 were non-H1N1pdm09 viruses (i.e. H3N2 Flu A with the RespiFinder \u00ae assay). Three samples gave negative PLEX-ID TM results. One of these samples was H1N1pdm09 and two were non-H1N1pdm09 influenza A viruses.\n\nThirteen discordant samples were tested with the Anyplex TM II RV16 Detection kit: seven were RespiFinder \u00ae concordant, while six were PLEX-ID TM concordant (Table 4 ). Six discordant samples were not tested due to a lack of material.\n\nThis study reported an evaluation of the PLEX-ID technology for detecting and identifying influenza genomes from clinical samples with the PLEX-ID TM Flu detection kit on the PLEX-ID TM Analyzer.\n\nThe emergence of reassortant influenza A viruses due to the accumulation of mutations in the H and the N genes 23 may lead to the appearance of new viruses that may spread throughout the whole human population as was the case for the H1N1pdm09 virus. This is a triple reassortant porcine H1N1 that has acquired the PB1 gene from the human influenza A H3N2virus. 15 This virus has been sequenced, but its porcine origin was only discovered by PCR coupled to electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. 24 The suitability and sensitivity of PCR/ESI-TOF-MS technology for use in clinical diagnosis have yet to be determined. We therefore evaluated the suitability of this new technique for detecting and subtyping the influenza genomes in prospective clinical samples.\n\nThe reference technique was the widely used RespiFinder \u00ae DC commercial kit that can detect 15 respiratory viruses, including Influenza A, B and H5N1 avian virus. As this kit does not identify H1N1 pdm09, we used a group of samples that were influenza A positive by the RespiFinder\u00ae to distinguish between H1N1pdm09 and non-H1N1pdm09 viruses using the RealTime ready Inf A/H1N1 Detection Set \u00ae assay.\n\nThe RespiFinder \u00ae and the PLEX-ID TM Flu detection assays performed comparably and gave similar results. Samples that gave discrepant results were tested with a third (confirmatory) technique, resulting in seven reference/confirmatory assay positives and six PLEX-ID/confirmatory assay positives. This could be attributed to intermittent or stochastic positivity at the lower limit of detection of the methodologies in low titre samples. This was confirmed by the high crossing point values (Ct) obtained with the confirmatory technique (38.74-43.13 cycles).\n\nThe PLEX-ID TM Flu detection assay detected both influenza A and influenza B genomes and also distinguished between H1N1pdm09 The RespiFinder \u00ae technique did not detect the influenza A genome in three samples that were positive for RSV. As the primers can compete with each other, some viruses present in minor quantities in clinical samples may not be amplified. The PLEX-ID TM system suffered no such restriction as it employs multiple primerpairs targeting core regions of the viruses in monoplex end-point RT-PCRs.\n\nThe PLEX-ID platform that we evaluated is a complete system that includes extraction, PCR and analysis with the PLEX-ID TM analyzer. The PCR analysis is twice as fast as with the Ibis T5000 25 (Ibis Biosciences, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) which was the first platform used for PCR/ESI-TOF-MS technology. The PLEX-ID TM input stacker can take 15 plates of PCR and the platform can process approximately 300 samples per 24-hour. The new kit used in this study can also identify H1N1pdm09 viruses, which the previous one 12, 26, 27 could not.\n\nInfluenza A viruses are identified and subtyped by bioinformatic analysis of detected amplicons. This signature is then referred to a regularly updated database that contains about 10,000 reference BC signatures.\n\nThis means that all genotypes of the influenza A genome may be recognised and diagnosed, as well as new zanamivir antiviral resistance mutation 28 and newly emerging swine variants (H3N2 v). 27 An \"open-mode\" reference database system that is more easily accessed would be a great help, as it would enable the detection of changes in a virus during a winter season. 12 These new signatures could then be added to keep the database up-to-date.\n\nIn conclusion, our results obtained from clinical samples collected prospectively show that the assay can detect and identify influenza A and B genomes, as well as coinfections with the two viruses. It can also successfully subtype the influenza A genomes. The assay results were well correlated with those obtained with the reference method, showing that the primer-pairs designed based on core conserved regions of the virus genome are suitable for identifying and characterizing influenza viruses.\n\nThe PLEX-ID Flu Detection TM kits were provided by Abbott, Ibis Biosciences."}
