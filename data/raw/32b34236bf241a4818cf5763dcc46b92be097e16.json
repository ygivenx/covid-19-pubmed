{"title": "Spatiotemporal Interplay of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus and Respiratory Mucosal Cells Drives Viral Dissemination in Rhesus Macaques HHS Public Access", "body": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious and life-threatening human respiratory disease caused by a zoonotic coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 1 . The global transmission of SARS-CoV is dependent on the capacity of this virus to efficiently cross from one host to the next by traversing the respiratory mucosa and overcoming host defenses to establish an infection, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. It is surprising that our knowledge of the immune events in the upper respiratory mucosa, in particular during acute respiratory infection, remains rather limited. Although the SARS epidemic was successfully contained by July 2003, there is serious concern regarding a recurrence of severe CoV-mediated disease. In particular, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has recently been identified as the etiological agent of a severe respiratory illness in patients from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan and the United Kingdom 2, 3 . Unraveling how upper airway mucosal exposure of SARS-CoV results in the establishment of infection and subsequent systemic virus dissemination is critical to understand its pathogenesis and to identify key steps for the future prevention of related disease.\n\nThe respiratory mucosa constitutes a natural barrier to pathogen invasion but also serves as an important gateway for respiratory infection. Many viruses, including SARS-CoV, breach this mucosal barrier by infecting the epithelium directly 4, 5 . After an initial amplification at the entry site, viruses interact with various immune cells, including dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages and T cells, beneath the epithelium 6 . Previous studies showed that these immune cells differ in their ability to induce an innate immune response against virus and in their roles in either the elimination or dissemination of viral infection. The roles they play greatly depend on their activation or differentiation status as well as their susceptibility to virus infection and replication [7] [8] [9] . For example, during early lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection, the virus targets monocytes/macrophages and DCs, contributing to immunosuppression that leads to persistent infection 7, 8 . During vaccinia virus (VV) infection, however, despite the fact that VV also infects inflammatory monocytes, CD8 + T cells pursue and lyse infected inflammatory monocytes and eliminate the infection at the primary site 10 . In the case of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, it is the activated mucosal CD38 + CD4 + T cells that are crucial for infection and dissemination of HIV-1 through the mucosa of the female lower genital tract 11 .\n\nType I alveolar epithelium is the predominant target for SARS-CoV infection, and macrophages were found to be subsequently infected in patients who died of SARS 4 . Infection leads to intense innate immune responses, which contribute to lung pathology. Patients also have evidence of systemic infection as indicated by other organ and immune dysfunctions, including prominent gastrointestinal symptoms of diarrhea, splenic atrophy, and lymphadenopathy [12] [13] [14] . Among these, acute renal failure in SARS patients usually has a catastrophic outcome, with a mortality rate of 77% 15 . Consistently, previous reports have described SARS viral particles and genomic sequences in urine, the mucosa of the intestine, the epithelium of the renal distal tubules, the neurons of the brain, circulating lymphocytes and lymphoid tissues 4, 16, 17 . While much is known about the terminal phase of SARS, little is known about the early events during the acute phase of infection. The early cellular target(s) of infection remain elusive, as do the innate immune response during acute infection, particularly in the upper respiratory tract, which is the initial site for SARS-CoV infection and replication, and the roles of innate cells in disease progression. Understanding of these factors requires robust knowledge of the phenotypes and functional features of the cells in the respiratory mucosa that are implicated in the early events of SARS-CoV infection, which is difficult to study in SARS-CoV-infected humans due to difficulties in collecting samples during the acute phase of infection.\n\nWe have recently demonstrated that the primary receptor of SARS-CoV, angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is widely distributed in the upper respiratory tract and the lungs of Chinese rhesus macaques and supports viral entry as efficiently as its human homologue [18] [19] [20] . Moreover, epithelial cells lining the salivary gland duct and alveolar pneumocytes are early cellular targets in Chinese rhesus macaques that are experimentally infected with pathogenic SARS-CoV 20 . In this study, we further investigated the kinetics of virus replication, cellular targets and the innate immune response during the acute phase of SARS-CoV infection in Chinese rhesus macaques. Based on these studies, we present a previously unrecognized model, demonstrating the mechanism underlying the mucosal innate activation of macrophages as well as the promotion of mucosal transmission and dissemination of SARS-CoV by a DC subpopulation.\n\nIn this study, twelve rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) of Chinese origin were challenged intranasally with the live pathogenic SARS-CoV PUMC (10 5 TCID 50 ) as previously described 20 . Four infected macaques were sacrificed at 2, 3, and 7 days post-inoculation (dpi). An additional three mock-inoculated animals served as negative controls ( Figure 1A ). Although there were no remarkable changes in leukocyte counts, and clinical signs such as cough, upper respiratory tract catarrh, dyspnea, loss of appetite, vomiting, rash, and diarrhea were absent, all infected animals did develop fever (~40\u00b0C). SARS-CoV RNA was readily detected by real-time RT-PCR in oral swabs from all infected macaques at multiple time points tested ( Figure 1B ), peaking at 1 or 2 dpi, with a slight decrease over the following days. By day 7, viral loads were maintained at similar levels in three out of four macaques, AD0516, AD0517 and AD0518, but were undetectable in one macaque (AD0515) ( Figure  1B ). In contrast, SARS-CoV RNA was detected in lung homogenates from two out of four macaques at 2 dpi (AD0506 and AD0508), and one of four macaques at 3 and 7 dpi only (AD0513 and AD0516), suggesting a trend towards decreased viral replication over time in the lungs. Hematoxylin and eosin stain (H&E) staining of lung tissues collected at the time of necropsy (2-7 dpi) revealed mild damage as indicated by thickened alveolar septa without the typical diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) found among SARS patients at the time of necropsy (2-7 dpi) ( Figure 1C ).\n\nConsistent with our previous findings 20 , positive IHC signals for the viral nucleoprotein (NP) were found in the epithelia of the salivary gland ducts and the trachea, as well as alveolar pneumocytes at 2 dpi ( Figure 2 ). Further extensive IHC analysis revealed NP + epithelial cells along the entire respiratory tract within 2 dpi in infected animals but not in control animals. In agreement with viral RNA detection by RT-PCR ( Figure 1B) , NP signals were predominant in the pharynx mucosa and the lungs by day 2 (Table 2 and Figure 2 ). Subsequently, more NP signals were detected at 7 dpi in the epithelium lining the nasal cavity and the vascular endothelium beneath the pharyngeal mucosa (Figure 2A and 2E ), suggesting a time lag for viral dissemination. In the lungs, NP + alveolar pneumocytes were primarily found at 2 dpi (2/4 monkeys, AD0506 and AD0508) and infrequently at 3 and 7 dpi (1/8 monkeys, AD0518) ( Table 1 ). Further analysis via detection of epithelial membrane antigen (AE1/AE3), viral N protein and viral genome RNA, however, demonstrated concentrated signals for both NP and viral RNA in AE1/AE3 + cells in the lungs at 2 dpi (2/4 monkeys, AD0506 and AD0508) and 7 dpi (AD0518), but only NP signals were detected in the upper respiratory mucosa, indicating a higher efficiency of viral replication in alveolar pneumocytes than in the upper respiratory mucosal epithelium during acute infection ( Figure  3 and Table 1) . Collectively, these findings demonstrated that a broad range of mucosal epithelial cells could be targeted for SARS-CoV seeding in the respiratory mucosal tissues, which is in line with the distribution of ACE2 + cells as we previously described 20 . Moreover, the results suggest a trend towards rapid control of epithelial infection in the lungs and more persistent viral production in the upper airway mucosa.\n\nThe lamina propria is rich in immune cells, including macrophages, DCs and lymphoid cells. Moreover, infected epithelium also induces the migration of circulating blood monocytes, macrophages and lymphocytes to the inflamed site of infection, rendering it a key place for immune responses to occur 6 . Beneath respiratory epithelial cells, NP + immune cells were readily detected within the lamina propria of the pharyngeal mucosa of all infected animals ( Figure 2B -E). To understand the innate immune response and define the phenotypes of these NP + cells, IHC double staining with a SARS NP antibody and antibodies for lymphocytes (CD3, CD20), macrophages (MAC387, CD68, CD163) or dendritic cells (DC-SIGN, Langerin) was performed. In infected animals but not in control animals, the pharyngeal mucosa exhibited strong staining of monocytes/macrophages, indicating monocyte/macrophage infiltration as early as 2 dpi (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure S1 ). These monocytes/macrophages include recently infiltrated monocytes/ macrophages (MAC387 + ), as well as activated/inflammatory macrophages (CD163 + ) (Supplementary Figure S1 ). In contrast, CD68 + monocytes/macrophages and Langerin + cells (LCs) were identified in the lamina propria in both infected and control animals (Supplementary Figure S1) . Interestingly, whereas the majority of CD163 + and nearly all CD68 + macrophages were localized beneath the epithelium in the lamina propria or mucosaassociated lymph tissue (MALT) ( Figure 4A , B and Supplementary Figure S1 ), many MAC387 + and some CD163 + monocytes/macrophages were found within and surrounding the epithelial layers targeted by SARS-CoV ( Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure S1 ), suggesting a possible role for these cells in the control of epithelial infection.\n\nIn the pharynx, NP signals were detected in the intracellular compartment containing CD163 + monocytes/macrophages within the epithelium, the intracellular compartment or cytoplasm of CD68 + monocytes/macrophages beneath the epithelium and the cytoplasm of DCs (Langerin + ) ( Figure 4 ) but not in lymphocytes (CD3 and CD20) and MAC387 + monocytes/macrophages ( Table 2 ). The positive staining for NP in CD163 + and CD68 + monocytes/macrophages and Langerin + cells suggests that the virus infected these cells within the pharyngeal mucosa. Indeed, double staining with antibodies for the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 and cell markers showed that, in addition to alveolar pneumocytes, bronchial epithelium and vascular endothelial cells, many immune cells demonstrated even stronger positive signals for ACE2 in the lungs (Supplementary Figure S2A ). These cells include CD68 + and MAC387 + monocytes/macrophages, Langerin + DCs and some CD163 + monocytes/macrophages (Supplementary Figure S2 and Table 2 ). Lymphocytes did not express ACE2 (Table 2 ). However, we could not detect SARS-CoV genomic RNA by ISH in mucosal immune cells, suggesting that they probably did not support highly productive replication of the virus.\n\nConsistent with the upper airway mucosa, IHC analysis revealed significant infiltration of monocytes/macrophages in the lungs at 2 dpi, consisting of inflammatory (CD163 + ) and newly infiltrated (MAC387 + ) monocytes/macrophages (Supplementary Figure S3) . Importantly, the number of CD163 + cells was about three times higher than that of MAC387 + population, and these cells were densely gathered around infected alveolar pneumocytes to form cell clusters ( Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure S3 ). CD163 + monocytes/macrophages within the cell clusters were enlarged in size, suggesting a histological manifestation of activation. Double IHC staining for cell markers and nucleoprotein or ISH detection of SARS-CoV RNA revealed concentrated signals for both viral NP and RNA in a single intracellular compartment in CD163 + and CD68 + monocytes/ macrophages in the lungs ( Figure 5A , B, D, E). Furthermore, IHC staining of viral NP, CD81 (cell membrane marker) and CD63 (late endosome marker) in monocytes/ macrophages revealed that NP signals were detected within intracellular compartments that were CD81 + /CD63 -(Supplementary Figure S4) . Because apoptotic bodies are CD63enriched compartments 21 , these NP + compartments in monocytes/macrophages were unlikely apoptotic bodies but probably accumulated virions in intracellular vesicles designated as virus-containing compartments (VCCs) [22] [23] [24] . Intriguingly, similar VCCs have been recently described in HIV-infected macrophages, which also sequester virions in CD81 + /CD63plasma membrane-derived intracellular invaginations during productive infection [22] [23] [24] . Importantly, although some VCCs are connected to the plasma membrane, they shield viral particles from neutralizing antibodies, raising an obstacle for the elimination of this viral reservoir 23 . These results suggested that SARS-CoV was probably sequestered into plasma membrane-derived VCCs of monocytes/macrophages after infection. As for DCs, NP signals but not RNA signals were observed in Langerin + cells in the lungs ( Figure 5C , F and Table 2) , indicating virus infection but inefficient productive replication in these cells.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that following intranasal inoculation, SARS-CoV infects epithelial cells, tissue resident macrophages (CD68) and Langerhans cells (Langerin + ), which induce the recruitment of monocytes/macrophages (MAC387 + and CD163 + ) to the site of inflammation and lead to the further spread of the virus to CD163 + monocytes/macrophages. The viral targeting of monocytes/macrophages and LCs, primarily antigen presenting cells (APCs), and in particular the sequestration of virions in an internal niche of monocytes/ macrophages and limited virus replication in LCs, may indicate that these cells are possible viral reservoirs that allow SARS-CoV to evade local innate immunity at the primary infection site. Subsequent migration of these infected APCs into draining lymph tissues may lead to systemic dissemination of the infection.\n\nTo determine the spreading routes of virus-infected APCs, we first examined the lymph tissues that are associated with the primary site of infection, the Waldeyer's tonsilar ring, which is comprised of nasopharyngeal, paired tubal, paired palatine, and lingual tonsils. As shown in Figure 6 , numerous NP + cells were detected around the trabeculae septum in tonsils as early as 2 dpi, with morphology suggestive of APCs ( Figure 6A ). To determine the identity of these cells, we stained NP + sections for CD3 (T cells), CD20 (B cells), DC-SIGN (monocyte-derived dendritic cells), Langerin (Langerhans cells), and CD68, CD163, and MAC387 (monocytes/macrophages). As shown in Figure 6 , there were significantly increased numbers of CD163 + and CD68 + monocytes/macrophages and Langerhans cells around the trabeculae and T cell zone in tonsils within 2 dpi. Moreover, the majority of Langerin + cells ( Figure 6B ), some CD163 and CD68 ( Figure 6C , D), are positive for NP, indicating the migration of NP + monocytes/macrophages and DCs from the primary infection site to lymphoid tissues within 2 dpi. None of the NP + cells expressed CD3, CD20 or MAC387.\n\nFurther ISH staining identified virus genome RNA + cells in the tonsil ( Figure 6E ). Interestingly, although we were not able to detect virus RNA signals in the monocytes/ macrophages in the upper airway mucosa, intermediate to strong virus RNA signals were observed in many CD68 + cells in the tonsils ( Figure 6F ). Therefore, we conclude that infectious viruses probably reached the deep mucosa and MALT, and established productive infection in the tonsils. Importantly, viral antigens were concentrated in Langerin + DCs and CD163 + and CD68 + monocytes/macrophages. These cells, therefore, are probably vehicles for spreading virus into deeper mucosal-associated lymphoid tissues shortly (2 d) after intranasal inoculation and may contribute to the systemic dissemination of infection.\n\nThe spreading of NP + and viral RNA + cells into tonsils and MALT led us to investigate the route and time course of viral dissemination into draining nodes, which is critical for systemic infection of the immune system. In both human and macaques, lymphatic drainage to the cervical lymph node occurs from the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and Waldeyer's ring. Trachea and lung lymphatics drain to the tracheobronchial and hilar lymph nodes, respectively. To monitor the periphery for viral spread, we also studied spleen samples. By IHC, we found NP + cells in lymphatic tissues of all experimentally infected macaques but not control animals ( Figure 7 ). As early as 2 dpi, all draining lymph nodes tested contained NP antigen in agreement with a broad range of viral seeding into the entire respiratory mucosal tissues. The appearance of NP antigen in the spleen, however, was less frequent at 2 and 3 dpi, observed only among two and three out of four animals, respectively. At 7 dpi, however, all of the animals were positive for NP antigen in the spleen (Figure 7 and Table 1 ). These results demonstrated that within two days of an intranasal inoculation, infected cells quickly disseminate virus to draining lymph nodes. Once there, systemic dissemination occurs shortly thereafter. Further study on intestinal samples showed positive signals for NP in small intestines of all infected animals at 7 dpi ( Figure 7G and Table 1 ), providing additional evidence of viral systemic dissemination within 7 days.\n\nWe then performed ISH for SARS-CoV RNA to further confirm viral production and determine the frequency and location of productively infected cells in the draining lymph nodes. Strong signal for viral genome RNA was detected in the tracheobronchial and hilar lymph nodes ( Figure 7E , F). Infected cells were localized to the trabecular and germinal center as well as the T cell-dependent, paracortical zone of the draining lymph node ( Figure  7F ). These findings suggested that infected cells migrate to the draining lymph node via the afferent lymphatics and enter the node through the subcapsular sinus. From here, these cells traverse to the T cell-dependent areas in the paracortical regions of the nodes.\n\nWe subsequently defined the cell types that carry infectious virus and support productive infection in the hilar lymphoid nodes. Draining lymph node sections were studied for RNA production by ISH, together with antibodies for dendritic cells (DC-SIGN and Langerin), monocytes/macrophages (CD68, CD163 and MAC387), T cells (CD3) and B cells (CD20). Consistent with the findings in the tonsils, the increased number of CD68 + and CD163 + monocytes/macrophages was readily observed in the draining lymph nodes (Supplementary Figure S5 ). Compared to the tonsils, only small numbers of Langerin + cells were detected in the LNs. Moreover, low-level RNA signals were also found in CD68 + cells around the trabecular septum ( Figure 8B1 Figure 8A1 , B2, C, red arrow). DC-SIGN is a monocyte-derived dendritic cell (MDDC)-specific lectin 25 . These infected cells likely represent different stages of the differentiation of the monocyte subpopulation (CD68 + and CD163 + ) into dendritic cells, during which monocytes begin to express DC-SIGN and down-regulate monocyte marker expression 26, 27 . The increased levels of viral RNA following monocyte differentiation into dendritic cells indicate that viral replication efficiency depends on the differentiation status of the cells. Nevertheless, in comparison with the restricted NP signals in intracellular compartments in CD68 + and CD163 + monocytes/ macrophages in the upper airway mucosa, strong NP signals were evenly distributed in the cytoplasm of those cells in the tonsils ( Figure 6C , D), suggesting that enhanced virus replication was also present in these cells after migration into tonsils.\n\nThese results suggested that CD163 + and CD68 + cells at the primary respiratory mucosa site of infection probably serve as viral reservoirs and allow SARS-CoV to evade local innate immunity by sequestering virus in an internal niche, which is difficult to access from the exterior. Virus replication capacity is subsequently enhanced following the differentiation of monocytes into dendritic cells as they migrate to lymphoid tissue, resulting in productive infection in tonsils and draining LNs and eventually systemic dissemination. Notably, in agreement with a previous description that infected macrophages present internally sequestered HIV to uninfected target cells at a virological synapse 28 , we also observed the formation of infectious synapses between CD163 + cells and NP + cells (Supplementary Figure S6 , blue arrow). Therefore, we conclude that CD163 + monocytes/macrophages may play a critical role in the dissemination of infection by sheltering and transferring live virus to the draining lymph nodes from the respiratory mucosa and further support virus production upon differentiation into MDDCs.\n\nThe human mucosa barrier constitutes the first line of host defense against virus transmission and infection. However, many viruses have developed efficient strategies to traverse the mucosal barrier, often by direct invasion of the epithelium. Upon penetration of this barrier, viruses interact with mucosal monocyte/macrophages, lymphocytes and LCs, which form the second line of innate host defense and bridge the third line of adaptive immunity 6, 10 . While this interaction is necessary for triggering immune protection, the virus may highjack immune cells to facilitate its dissemination and infection. For example, in the case of HIV sexual transmission, mucosal LCs and DCs play a role in capturing and disseminating newly produced virus to the main target, CD4 + T cells, which are essential for the establishment of productive infection 11, 29 . To date, the early respiratory mucosal events of SARS-CoV infection remain incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated these events in Chinese macaques following the intranasal inoculation of a pathogenic live SARS-CoV. This model has been reported to mirror the pathogenesis of humans SARS in several studies 19, 30, 31 . The clinical relevance of this model includes elevated body temperature, lung pathology, SARS-CoV antigen detection in type I pneumocytes and eventually viral systemic dissemination in infected macaques, providing strong support for the extrapolation of the findings in our study to the transmission and dissemination of respiratory infection in humans 19, 30, 31 .\n\nWe first examined the process of SARS-CoV infection from the site of entry to the respiratory portion of the lung and subsequent systemic dissemination, as well as the status and role of respiratory mucosa innate immunity in protection, productive infection and transmission of the virus. By measuring the cells that were positive for viral NP protein, we found that SARS-CoV spread quickly from the upper respiratory tract to the lung within 2 dpi (Figure 2) , which includes epithelial cells from the nasopharynx, oropharynx, laryngopharynx, trachea and bronchus (Figure 2A-G) . The majority of positive cells were abundantly identified in the pharynx areas, including the epithelial cells lining the salivary ducts that we previously described (Figure 2 ) 20 . These areas are likely one of the major sites of SARS-CoV invasion and shedding. Under the epithelial cells, we found that monocytes/ macrophages and DCs were actively involved in SARS-CoV infection. As shown in Figure 4 and 5, resident CD68 + macrophages and inflammatory CD163 + macrophages were among the early target cells infected within 2 dpi. The infection of epithelial cells resulted in the significant recruitment of circulating blood monocytes, macrophages, and eventually lymphocytes to the sites of viral invasion. In particular, the rapid recruitment of MAC387 + monocytes/macrophages and selective accumulation of CD163 + macrophages indicated active chemotaxis due to local inflammation 7 . However, the monocyte/macrophage population was not homogeneous in its ability to be infected and to support viral replication and transmission (Figure 4, 5) . Despite the universal expression of ACE2 on MAC387 macrophages (Supplementary Figure S2B) , SARS-CoV mainly infected CD163 + or CD68 + macrophages in the respiratory mucosa (Figure 4 and 5) . These findings indicate that, in addition to ACE2 expression, other factors such as the activation/differentiation status of monocytes/macrophages are probably critical for SARS-CoV infection, and CD163 + macrophages might be crucial for the establishment and dissemination of infection ( Figure  8 ).\n\nOur data suggest that CD68 + and CD163 + monocytes/macrophages may serve as shelters for immune evasion and vehicles for productive infection and dissemination of the virus into MALT (e.g., tonsils) and draining lymph nodes (Figure 6, 8) . Several previous studies showed that in vitro infection of primary human monocyte-derived macrophages/DCs was likely abortive 32, 33 . Since these studies used monocyte-derived primary macrophages/DCs, mainly terminally differentiated cells, they might not reflect the in vivo situation, especially when monocytes/macrophages are highly plastic and heterogeneous in vivo. We detected compartmented viral RNA in VCCs of monocytes/macrophages in respiratory mucosa but abundant viral RNA in the cytoplasm of MDDCs in dLNs (Figure 8 ). We speculated that although infected monocytes/macrophages might not produce viruses effectively in mucosa, they might have supported a low level of viral replication after they differentiated into DCs in dLNs. This is possible because cytokines (e.g., TNF) produced by infected cells could skew cell differentiation from macrophages to DCs 34, 35 . To this end, low-levels of SARS-CoV replication were found in monocytes-derived DCs in one study 36 . Critically, infectious SARS-CoV was released into culture supernatants and recovered from infected monocytederived DCs 36 . Recent studies also demonstrated that SARS-CoV infection of monocytes/ macrophages could induce DC-SIGN expression on these cells 37 . CD163 protein levels are suppressed when monocytes differentiate towards dendritic cells 27 . To determine the activation/differentiation status of infected monocytes/macrophages, we measured the expression of DC-SIGN and CD163 on viral RNA + cells in dLNs ( Figure 8 ). Interestingly, we likely identified virus-infected monocytes at different stages of differentiation into DCs in the draining LNs, as indicated by strong RNA signals in monocyte-derived DCs (DC-SIGN + ), which still express low levels of CD163 (Figure 8 ). The lack of active viral replication in mucosal monocytes/macrophages and the restriction of virions in the CD81 + / CD63 \u2212 intracellular compartment (Supplementary Figure S4) are probably beneficial for viruses to escape local antiviral innate immunity because the low levels of viral RNA in the cytoplasm and protein on the cell surface help the virus to avoid TLR sensing and killing by NK cells. This hypothesis is based on similar intracellular structures recently described in HIV-infected macrophages, which concentrate virions in CD81 + , plasma membrane-derived intracellular invaginations during infection 22, 24 . Importantly, the sequestered HIV was able to translocate to the virological synapse formed between infected macrophages and uninfected T cells 28 . Consistently, we also observed virological synapses formed between CD163 + monocytes and NP + cells (Supplementary Figure S6) , suggesting possible cell-tocell transmission. Moreover, the increased virus production efficiency in monocytes upon differentiation into DCs might have resulted in the establishment of productive infection in lymphoid tissue, virus release into the circulating system, and eventual systemic dissemination.\n\nIn addition to monocytes/macrophages, intraepithelial or subepithelial LCs may also contribute to the establishment of systemic infection via the dissemination of newly produced virus or the presentation of infectious virus to other cells. From the mucosal site, LCs migrate into the afferent lymphatics, enter the lymph nodes through the subcapsular sinus and travel toward the T cell areas in the paracortical regions. LCs specifically express Langerin and were previously reported to mediate the transmission of HIV-1 to T cells and to keep LCs refractory to HIV-1 transmission in different studies 11, 29 . To determine the role of LCs in SARS-CoV transmission, we double-stained pharyngeal mucosal tissue sections with antibodies against SARS NP and DC-SIGN or Langerin. We revealed the distribution, migration and potential role of LCs in the upper respiratory system during SARS-CoV infection, as schematically summarized in Figure 8 . We readily found a large number of LCs in the intraepithelial and subepithelial areas of the pharynx ( Figure 4C and Supplementary Figure S1A ). Like monocytes/macrophages, upon encountering a virus, NP + LCs were found in the epithelial lining of the pharyngeal mucosa ( Figure 4C ) and migrated rapidly from the pharynx mucosa into the tonsils ( Figure 6B ). The large number of NP + LCs in the tonsil suggested a highly effective process by LCs for antigen presentation and virus dissemination into lymphoid tissues ( Figure 6B ). The lack of viral RNA signal in LCs by ISH, however, indicated that LCs probably do not support productive viral replication. We, however, cannot exclude the possibility that NP + LCs are able to transmit virus to other cells and produce small amounts of virus. To this end, we detected many cells harboring viral RNA in the tonsils by ISH, which confirmed virus infection of the upper respiratory mucosa (Figure 6 and 7) . This finding indicated that tonsils can be another source of virus in oral swabs, particularly early in infection. To our knowledge, this is the first report of productive SARS-CoVinfection in the tonsils. SARS-CoV production preferentially persists in the upper respiratory mucosa during the acute phase, as indicated by the prevalent virus antigen in the mucosal epithelium and immune cells beneath the epithelium (Figure 2) , and more importantly, the persistent viral loads in the oral swabs ( Figure 1 ).\n\nChinese macaques, similar to humans that died of SARS 4 . Under our experimental conditions, which involved a large viral inoculum, NP signal was readily detected in alveolar pneumocytes in macaques (Figure 2 ). Among four macaques sacrificed at 2 dpi, however, only two (AD0506 and AD0508) exhibited extensive positive signals (Figure 2) , and only scattered NP + cells were found in lungs of two other macaques. These results, together with the NP + cells found in the LNs draining the lungs, suggested that SARS-CoV was disseminated to the lower respiratory system in a rather effective and rapid manner. Moreover, viral RNA was readily detected in type I pneumocytes, which was indicative of productive infection established in the lungs. T cells were productively infected in the lymph nodes of patients who died of SARS 16 . We, however, could not detect infected T cells in the respiratory mucosa or lymph nodes during the acute phase (2 dpi) (data not shown). T cells, therefore, are unlikely to be early targets of infection in Chinese macaque model. Whether these findings underlie the lack of SARS in Chinese macaques remains to be investigated in future 18 .\n\nIn summary, our findings led to a model of SARS-CoV mucosal infection (Figure 8) . The virus breaches the mucosal barrier by infecting the respiratory epithelium, mainly around the pharynx and larynx, and subsequently infects mucosal Langerhans cells and resident macrophages. In the meantime, CD163 + and MAC387 + monocytes/macrophages are quickly recruited in droves by a chemotactic gradient from infected epithelium and tissue resident macrophages. However, these monocytes/macrophages are unlikely to be sufficient to eliminate the incoming viral attack, which allows LGs and CD163 + /CD68 + monocytes/ macrophages carrying the virus to migrate to the MALT and draining lymph nodes via the afferent lymphatics. Once inside, CD163 + monocytes/macrophages unexpectedly support productive viral replication upon differentiation into DCs. Free virus and infected DCs may infect or trans-infect new target cells, respectively, and then leave through the efferent lymphatics for systemic dissemination (e.g., spleen and intestine, Figure 7D , G).\n\nSARS-CoV-infected animals and control animals were all adult female rhesus monkeys (Chinese rhesus macaques). A total of twelve Chinese rhesus macaques were challenged with live pathogenic SARS-CoV (PUMC01, TCID50=50) via the nasal cavity route as previously described 5, 22 . An additional three uninfected macaques were inoculated with PBS as negative controls. The animals were subjected to daily measurement of anal temperature, routine blood assays, and chest radiography. Four animals were euthanized at 2, 3 and 7 days after inoculation (Figure 1 ). All animals were humanely euthanized with an intravenous overdose of pentobarbital and were immediately necropsied. A complete set of tissues, including multiple levels of the respiratory tract, draining LNs and spleens, was collected. The respiratory tract includes the nasal cavity, nasopharynx, oropharynx, epiglottis, larynx, trachea, left bronchus, right bronchus and lungs (left and right cranial, middle and caudal lobes and right accessory lobe). Tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5 Qm. The experiment was conducted in our Bio-Safety Level 3 animal facility. The animal protocols were approved by our institutional animal welfare committee.\n\nPharyngeal swab samples were collected from infected monkeys starting on the first day after inoculation. Chinese macaques were sacrificed on days 2, 3 and 7 after virus challenge, and lung homogenates of each animal were generated. To detect the viral RNA in specimens of SARS-CoV-inoculated monkeys, total RNA was extracted from various specimens with TRIZOL (Invitrogen) and tested for SARS-CoV by nested RT-PCR as previously described 5, 22 . Briefly, RT-PCR was performed in a 50-\u03bcl reaction volume with an outer primer pair (5-GCTGCATTGGTTTGTTATATCGTTA-TGC-3_ and 5_-ATACAGAATACAT-AGATTGCTGTTATCC-3_) and an inner primer pair (5_-TCACTTGCTTCCGTTGAGGTAGC-CAGCGTGGT-GGTTCATACAA-3_ and 5_-GGTTTCGGATGTTACAGCGTCTCCCGG-CAGAAAGCTGTAAGCT-3_). All PCR products were verified by nucleotide sequencing.\n\nImmunohistochemical staining was performed on 5-\u03bcm paraffin sections of formalin-fixed tissue samples. Samples were de-paraffinized and rehydrated. After blocking endogenous peroxidases with 0.3% H 2 O 2 and 0.03% NaN 3 for 30 min, 10% normal goat serum was applied for 30 min at room temperature. Rabbit anti-SARS CoV nucleocapsid antibody was added at room temperature for 1 hr. Sections were then washed and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (DakoCytomation) for 1 hr at room temperature. The signal was developed with diaminobenzidine chromogen substrate (DakoCytomation). Sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin (DakoCytomation) and mounted with Crystal/mounting. Electronic images were visualized under a microscope (Eclipse E600; Nikon), were captured and saved to a computer using the software ACT-1 (Nikon).\n\nImmunofluorescence staining was performed on 5-\u03bcm paraffin sections of formalin-fixed tissue samples. Samples were de-paraffinized and rehydrated. After blocking with normal goat serum for 30 min at room temperature, rabbit anti-SARS CoV nucleocapsid antibody was applied at 4\u00b0C overnight or for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by Alex 488conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody for 1 hour at room temperature. Additional immunofluorescence staining was then performed by incubating the second set of primary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature or 4\u00b0C overnight, followed by the detection of signals with appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature.\n\nISH was developed for the detection of SARS-CoV. DNA fragments for the M, N protein and spike protein from the SARS-CoV strain from Hong Kong (AY278491) were used as templates to generate an RNA probe. The probe was labeled with digoxigenin. Formalinfixed, paraffin wax-embedded tissues were cut into 5-\u03bcm sections. After deparaffinization and rehydration, the sections were treated with microwave heating in an 800 W domestic microwave oven on medium power for 10 min in 0.01 M sodium citrate buffer. Hybridization was performed at high stringency with 150 ng/ml denatured probe at 45\u00b0C for 16 h in 50 \u03bcl of hybridization mix in a moist chamber 20 . Excess probe was removed by washing twice in 2\u00d7 SSC for 20 min at 45\u00b0C. This was followed by 2 washes in 1\u00d7 SSC and 0.1\u00d7 SSC for 20 min at 45\u00b0C. Immunological detection was conducted using a DIG Nuclear Acid Detection Kit (Roche) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, after incubation with 1% blocking reagent for 30 min, the sections were incubated with sheep anti-digoxigenin alkaline phosphatase conjugate diluted 1:500 for 2 h at room temperature. After three separate washes with washing buffer_ENREF_20 20 , the signal was developed using 200 \u03bcl HNPP/Fast Red TR mix in the dark for 45 min. Sections were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Tissue sections incubated with a sense RNA probe were used as negative controls.\n\nCytokeratin (AE1/AE3, Dako, 1:50) was used as an epithelial marker, while Mac387, CD163, CD68 and Ham56 (Dako, 1: 20) were used as macrophage markers, DC-SIGN was used as a dendritic cell marker, Langerin was used as a Langerhans cell marker, CD3 as a T cell marker, and CD20 as a B cell marker. Double immunofluorescence-FISH was performed as for ISH, with additional immunofluorescence detection performed by incubating primary antibodies overnight before the detection of signals with the appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies. ISH signals were detected using anti-digoxigenin alkaline phosphatase conjugate and HNPP/Fast Red TR mix (Roche). The secondary antibody for immunofluorescence was generally anti-mouse fluorescein thiocyanate (FITC) (Invitrogen). Nuclei were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in anti-fade mounting medium (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories).\n\nConfocal microscopy was performed using a Carl Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope equipped with four lasers. Adobe Photoshop (version 7.0; Adobe, San Jose, CA) was used to assign colors to the four channels collected: Alexa 568 and HNPP/Fast Red, which fluoresce when exposed to a 568-nm wavelength laser, appear red; Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes) appears green; Alexa 633 (Molecular Probes) appears yellow. The four channels were collected simultaneously. In some tissues and to differentiate between individual cells, Hoechst 33258 (nuclear marker, Molecular Probes) was used at 1 \u03bcg/ml, incubated for 5 minutes, and tissues were then rinsed in water. Co-localization of antigens was demonstrated by the addition of colors as indicated in the figure legend.\n\nA. Experimental scheme for virus challenge. A total of twelve Chinese rhesus macaques were challenged with live pathogenic SARS-CoV (10 5 TCID 50 ) via the nasal cavity. Four animals each were sacrificed at 2, 3, and 7 days post-inoculation. Three additional uninfected macaques were challenged with PBS as negative controls. B. Detection of viral RNA in oral swabs and lungs. SARS coronavirus RNA was detected by nested RT-PCR in the swabs at multiple time points post-infection from all 12 monkeys and in lung homogenates from two out of four macaques at 2 dpi (AD0506 and AD0508) and one out of four macaques at 3 and 7 dpi (AD0513 and AD0516). C. Examples of HE staining of lung tissue. Macaques inoculated with SARS-CoV exhibited slightly thickened alveolar septa and some monocyte infiltration at days 2, 3 and 7 (C, red arrows) with epithelial cell debris present in the alveolar lumen at day 2 (C, 2d, blue arrows). Macaques inoculated with cell culture medium exhibited normal alveolar septa, intact reticular fibers and epithelial lining (C. Neg). Each image is representative of at least three monkeys.\n\nExamples of tissue sections stained with anti-nucleoprotein (red) and hematoxylin (blue). Panel 1 shows a low magnification overview (200x). Panel 2 shows a higher magnification of the boxed area in panel 1 (400x). Panel 3 shows the same tissue from an uninfected monkey (200x). In the nasal cavity (A), NP + cells were identified in the epithelial lining at 7 dpi (A2, yellow arrow). In the pharynx (B and C) and laryngopharynx (D and E), NP + cells were identified at the epithelium of salivary gland ducts at 2 and 3 dpi (C2, yellow arrow), the basal layer of the epidermis (C1 and E1, red arrow), the lamina propria (B2 and D2, black arrow), and the epithelial lining of the mucosa (B2 and D2, yellow arrow) at 2, 3 and 7 dpi, and the vascular endothelium (E2, blue arrow) at 7 dpi. In the trachea (F), NP + cells were found in the epithelial lining (F2, yellow arrow) and lamina propria (F2, black arrow). In the bronchus (G), NP + cells were identified in the epithelial lining (G2, yellow arrow). In the lungs (H), NP + were observed on type I pneumocytes (H2, yellow arrow) and infiltrated immunocytes (H2, black arrow). Mucosal Immunol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 July 08. and Langerin \u2212 (red arrow). E. Model of mucosal transmission of SARS-CoV. Langerhans cells are shown in green, macrophages in blue, and virus in red. SARS-CoV infects the epithelium and resident macrophages shortly after infection. Immune cells are subsequently recruited in droves via a chemotactic gradient from the infected epithelium and/or tissueresident and alveolar macrophages. Those inflammatory cells are heterogeneously composed of CD163 + perivascular macrophages and recently infiltrated MAC387 + monocytes/ macrophages. CD163 + macrophages are productively infected when fighting against the infection and subsequently transmit virus to draining lymph nodes by migrating via the afferent lymphatics. In the nasopharynx and oropharynx, Langerhans cells were also infected and migrated to the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. However, active viral replication was not detected in the Langerhans cells. Their role in virus production and transmission remains uncertain.
