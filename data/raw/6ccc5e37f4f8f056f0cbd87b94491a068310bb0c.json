Measure progesterone in serum to optimize breeding timing (see Chapter 2) . \u2022 Subclinical uterine infection may occur. Collect a specimen for culture from the anterior vagina, 561 using a guarded swab, early in proestrus. Moderate to heavy growth of a single organism is significant. Treat with an appropriate antibiotic, based on culture and sensitivity testing, for 2-4 weeks. \u2022 Brucellosis is associated with infertility in bitches and dogs. Regular serologic testing is recommended in all breeding animals (see Chapter 7). \u2022 Hypothyroidism is associated with irregular cycles in the bitch and poor semen quality in the male dog. Concurrent measurement of free thyroxine (T4) by dialysis and of canine thyroid-stimulating hormone (cTSH) in serum is the diagnostic scheme ofchoice. Appropriate supplementation of hypothyroid animals mayor may not effect a change to normal fertility. Hypothyroidism may be hereditary. \u2022 Abnormal semen quality may be associated with apprehension at the time of breeding or semen collection, prostate disease (see Chapter 17), testicular disorders (see Chapter 16), brucellosis (see Chapter 7) , or hypothyroidism. \u2022 Infertility in cats \u2022 Queens are seasonally polyestrous. If the environment is such that the queen is not exposed to at least 10 hours oflight daily, she may not cycle. \u2022 A queen should be brought to the tom's environment. Copulation must take place at least four times during estrus to reliably induce ovulation. Serum progesterone concentration greater than 2 ng ml after the queen goes out of behavioral estrus is indicative ofovulation having occurred. \u2022 Viral causes of pregnancy loss in the queen include feline leukemia, feline infectious peritonitis, feline herpesvirus (rhinotracheitis), and panleukopenia. Toxoplasmosis and bacterial infections are uncommon causes of pregnancy loss in queens. \u2022 Semen evaluation in tom cats is challenging; cystocentesis after copulation is a noninvasive technique that allows assessment for spermatogenesis but not evaluation of semen quality. Electroejaculation can be performed in anesthetized tom cats.\n\n1. The bitch is cycling. (Proceed to 2.) 1'. The bitch has never cycled.\n\n\u2022 Primary anestrus is lack of estrous activity in a bitch by 24 months ofage. \u2022 Causes include the following:\n\nHusbandry: Bitches that are malnourished or that are under stress because of heavy work or show schedules may not cycle. Housing with cycling bitches may stimulate estrous activity in anestrous bitches. (Proceed to 3.) 2'. The interestrous interval is abnormally long (longer than 12 months).\n\n\u2022 Breed: Some breeds normally cycle less frequently than the average interestrous interval of every 7 months. These breeds include the basenji, dingo, and wolf-dog hybrids, all of which cycle yearly. \u2022 Hypothyroidism: See 1'. 2\". The interestrous interval is abnormally short.\n\n\u2022 Breed: Some breeds normally cycle more frequently than the average interestrous interval of every 7 months. These breeds include the German shepherd dog, rottweiler, and basset hound. \u2022 Split heat: Split heat is defined as proestrous activity for 1-2 weeks, followed by an anestrous period averaging 1 month in duration before normal ovulatory estrus occurs. Diagnosis requires measurement of progesterone in serum during the intermediary anestrous period (serum progesterone concentration less than 2 ng/ml indicates that ovulation has not occurred) and after the second period of estrous activity (serum progesterone concentration greater than 2 ng/ ml indicates that ovulation has occurred). Split heat is not associated with infertility unless the bitch is forcibly bred during the anovulatory portion of the split heat. \u2022 Uterine disease (see Chapter 12): Bitches with cystic endometrial hyperplasia (CEH) or subclinical uterine infection may more readily release prostaglandin from the endometrium, prematurely lysing the corpora lutea and increasing cycle frequency. CEH may be visible ultrasonographically as a fluffy thickening of the uterine wall. Because of the relative inaccessibility of the canine uterus, uterine infection usually is best diagnosed by anterior vaginal culture in estrous bitches. 2\"'. The bitch is in persistent estrus.\n\n\u2022 Ovarian cyst (see Chapter 11): Ovarian cystic disease in the bitch usually is caused by lack of ovulation of a cystic follicle. Persistent estrogen secretion is manifested clinically as persistent estrus. Although the presence of persistently elevated serum estrogen concentrations is diagnostic, estrogen assay is difficult and may not be available. Identification of cornified vaginal epithelial cells for 6 weeks or longer also is diagnostic of persistently elevated serum estrogen concentrations. Ovarian follicular cysts may be visible with transabdominal ultrasound but often are difficult to see. Response to treatment with GnRH (50 /lg administered intramuscularly) or hCG (1000 IV, half of which is administered intramuscularly and half of which is administered intravenously) may be diagnostic. \u2022 Granulosa cell tumor (see Chapter 11): Functional granulosa cell tumors of the ovary may be manifested clinically as persistent estrus. A granulosa cell tumor may be palpable as a mass in the cranial abdomen or may be visible on survey radiographs or with transabdominal ultrasound. Ovariohysterectomy is the treatment ofchoice. 3. Normal copulation occurs. (Proceed to 5.) 3'. Normal copulation does not occur. (Proceed to 4.) 4. The male shows normal breeding behavior, but the bitch does not allow copulation.\n\n\u2022 Behavior: Dominant bitches may not allow male dogs to mount and achieve intromission. The problem is best circumvented by artificial insemination (see Chapter 3) . fold prolapse is protrusion of edematous vaginal tissue through the vulvar lips. This is an estrogen-mediated phenomenon that subsides when serum estrogen concentrations decline and that often recurs during subsequent heat cycles. Bitches with vaginal prolapse usually must be bred by artificial insemination because male dogs mount but have difficulty achieving intromission of the penis in the presence of the prolapsed vaginal tissue. Vaginal prolapse may redevelop near the time of parturition and may or may not cause dystocia. 4'. The bitch shows normal breeding behavior, but the male does not mount or achieve intromission and ejaculation. Hypoluteoidism: Hypoluteoidism is inadequate progesterone secretion from luteal tissue during pregnancy. Insufficiency of corpora lutea may predispose the bitch to premature labor as serum progesterone concentrations fall too early in gestation. Serum progesterone concentration must be greater than 2 ng/ml to support pregnancy. Routine supplementation with progestogens is not recommended during pregnancy because excessive progesterone may masculinize female fetuses and prevent expulsion of nonviable fetuses. If serum progesterone concentrations are documented to decrease too early in gestation, supplementation may be instituted with progesterone in oil (2 mg/kg administered intramuscularly every 3 days) or ally-trenbolone (Regumate; Hoechst-Roussell, Kansas City, Mo.; 0.088 mg/kg administered orally once daily) to no later than 61 days after ovulation. Serum progesterone concentrations must decline before labor is initiated in bitches; maintenance of pregnancy beyond 65 days after ovulation by artificial supplementation with progesterone causes fetal death. 7. Semen quality is normal. (Proceed to 8.) 7'. Semen quality is not normal. (Proceed t09.) 8. In a bitch with no reproductive tract disease bred to a male with normal semen quality in which pregnancy does not occur, poor breeding management is the most likely problem. Improper timing of breeding is the most common causeof apparent infertility in dogs. Breeding management is optimized with measurement of progesterone in serum to pinpoint ovulation time within the bitch's estrous cycle. Serum progesterone concentration is 5-8 ng/ml on ovulation day, and the optimal breeding day in bitches is 2 days after ovulation (see Chapter 2). 9. Semen quality, although abnormal, is adequate to effect pregnancy. (Proceed to 10.) A minimum of 250 million normal spermatozoa per ejaculate must be introduced into the bitch's reproductive tract to reliably effect pregnancy. Male dogs with abnormal motility or morphology of spermatozoa and a high total number of spermatozoa in the ejaculate may still be capable of effecting pregnancy. For example, a male with 1 billion spermatozoa in his ejaculate, only 50% of which are morphologically normal, still has 500 x 10 6 morphologically normal spermatozoa, which is well above the 250 x 10 6 required. Optimization of conception rate by breeding 2 days after ovulation, as assessed by serial measurement of serum progesterone concentrations, is strongly recommended when using a subfertile male dog. g'. Semen quality is insufficient to effect pregnancy.\n\n\u2022 Normalsemen qualityis defined as 300 million to 2 billion spermatozoa in the ejaculate, with more than 70% of the spermatozoa exhibiting progressive motility and more than 80% of the spermatozoa being normal in morphology. \u2022 Azoospermiais absence of spermatozoa in the ejaculate. Causes may be pretesticular, testicular, or posttesticular. Pretesticular causes include apprehension at the time of semen collection or breeding; administration of drugs that impair spermatogenesis, such as high dosages of glucocorticoids or antineoplastic agents; hypothyroidism (see 1'); and inguinal or scrotal hernia. Diagnosis ofincomplete ejaculation as a result of apprehension may be made based on measurement of alkaline phosphatase in seminal fluid. Alkaline phosphatase in semen arises from the cauda epididymis; concentrations ofless than 5000 IV/L in seminal fluid suggest that no fluid from the epididymis is present in the seminal fluid. Measurement of alkaline phosphatase in seminal fluid cannot differentiate incomplete ejaculation from obstructive causes of azoospermia. Testicular causes include intersex states; bilateral cryptorchidism; any thermal or physical insult to the testicular tissue, such as high fever or trauma occurring during the 2 months or more preceding lack of spermatozoa in the ejaculate; and testicular neoplasia (see Chapter 16) . Posttesticular causes include sources of epididymal occlusion, such as spermatocele or sperm granulomas. Epididymal occlusion may be visualized during scrotal ultrasonography. \u2022 Oligozoospermia is presence of fewer than 300 million spermatozoa in the ejaculate. Apparent oligozoospermia may occur in dogs with retrograde ejaculation, which is movement of spermatozoa into the urinary bladder during ejaculation instead of through the penile urethra. The cause of retrograde ejaculation in dogs is unknown. Diagnosis is made based on a collection of urine by cystocentesis after ejaculation, with demonstration of an abnormally large number of spermatozoa in the urine sediment. Antegrade ejaculation can be effected by administration of the sympathomimetic drug, pseudoephedrine (4-5 mg/kg administered orally 1 and 3 hours before breeding). Teratozoospermia is presence ofless than 80% morphologically normal spermatozoa in the ejaculate. Asthenozoospermia is presence ofless than 70% progressively motile spermatozoa in the ejaculate. Oligozoospermia, teratozoospermia, and asthenozoospermia often occur concurrently. Causes include infection of the reproductive tract, localized either in the prostate (see Chapter 17) or testes (see Chapter 16) and including canine brucellosis (see 6'), testicular neoplasia (see Chapter 16), and hypothyroidism (see 1'). 10. A diagnosis of idiopathic infertility must be made.\n\n1. The queen is cycling normally. (Proceed to 2.) 1'. The queen is not cycling.\n\nCauses for lack of estrous cycling in queens include the following: \u2022 Sexual immaturity: Queens go through puberty at 5-10 months of age, with longhaired breeds entering puberty later than shorthaired breeds. Cats will not enter puberty during the seasonal anestrus, from mid-October through December at temperate latitudes. 2'. Normal copulation is not occurring. (Proceed to 4.) 3. The male mounts and achieves intromission.\n\n(Proceed to 5.) 3'. The male cannot mount and achieve intromission.\n\nCauses for inability to mount and achieve intromission include the following: \u2022 Presence ofa penile hair ring: Hair is compacted at the base of the penis. This is easily diagnosed via inspection and usually is easily removed. \u2022 Apprehension:Tom cats should be bred in their home territory and may benefit from socialization with the queen in the days before breeding. \u2022 Physical causes of poor libido and inability to mount: Causes include pain of the spine or rear limbs, malnutrition, and obesity. 4. The queen allows the male to mount. (Proceed to 3.) 4'. The queen will not allow the male to mount.\n\nA vaginal cytology specimen should be evaluated to determine whether the queen is in estrus, with cornification ofvaginal epithelial cells indicative of elevated serum estrogen concen trations and presence of an ovarian follicle.\n\n5. The queen is induced to ovulate (evidenced by elevation in serum progesterone concentration to greater than 2 ng/ml by 7 days after breeding). (Proceed to 6.) 5'. The queen is not induced to ovulate.\n\nThe amount ofLH released depends on the number of copulations and the time during the estrous cycle when copulation occurs. Less than 50% of queens bred only once ovulate. More than four copulations during a given estrus are required to ensure LH release adequate for ovulation. Queens that cannot be induced to ovulate by copulation may be treated with GnRH (25 Ilg administered intramuscularly 12-24 hours after breeding). Physical stimulation of the vagina with a cotton-tipped swab or glass rod does not reliably induce ovulation in queens.\n\n6. The queen conceives after copulation. * (Proceed to 7.) 6'. The queen does not conceive after copulation.* (Proceed to 8.)\n\n*Cats do not produce any hormone unique to pregnancy, precluding pregnancy diagnosis early in gestation. Therefore lack of conception cannot be differentiated from early embryonic death. Conception is assumed to have occurred if the queen was bred an adequate number of times by a known fertile tom.\n\n\u2022 Loss of pregnancy near midgestation may not be clinically evident because the queen may resorb the fetal tissues. Abortion after midgestation usually is accompanied by discharge of fluid or fetal tissues from the vulva, although the occasional queen will resorb late in gestation with no clinical signs of pregnancy loss. \u2022 Causes of pregnancy loss in the cat include the following:\n\nLuteal insufficiency: Feline abortion may be caused by abnormally low serum progesterone concentrations. Insufficiency of the corpora lutea or possible placental sources of progesterone may predispose the queen to premature labor because serum progesterone concentrations fall too early in gestation. Serum progesterone concentrations must be greater than 2 ng/ml to support pregnancy. Routine supplementation with progestogens is not recommended during pregnancy because excessive progesterone may masculinize female fetuses, prevent expulsion of nonviable fetuses, and induce diabetes mellitus and mammary abnormalities. \u2022 Semen quality is difficult to assess in cats because ofdifficulty in obtaining a semen sample. Gross evaluation of semen quality may be attempted by collecting a vaginal cytology specimen from the queen immediately after breeding. Retrograde ejaculation, movement of spermatozoa into the urinary bladder during ejaculation, occurs in normal toms.\n\nCollection of a urine sample by cystocentesis immediately after breeding, with centrifugation and examination of the sediment, also may allow gross evaluation of semen quality. Electroejaculation also may be performed; this requires general anesthesia and use ofspecialized equipment. \u2022 Causes for abnormal semen quality in tom cats include the following: Karyotype abnormalities (calico and tortoiseshell male cats): Calico (black, white, and orange) and tortoiseshell (black and orange or gray and cream) male cats often are infertile. White coat color is carried on an autosome. The gene for black or orange coat color is carried on the X chromosome. Normal male cats, which have a single X chromosome, can exhibit either black or orange, but not both. Calico and tortoiseshell male cats must have two X chromosomes, suggesting either triploidy (39,XXY) or mosaicism/chimerism (XX/XY, XY/XY, XXY/XY). Azoospermia (absence of spermatozoa in the ejaculate) often accompanies this abnormal karyotype.\n\nTesticular atrophy: Poor semen quality may be caused by malnutrition, hypervitaminosis A, elevated testicular or intrascrotal temperature secondary to fever or scrotal trauma, or advancing age. 9. A diagnosis of idiopathic infertility must be made. In Kirk RW (ed): Current veterinary therapy X, Philadelphia, 1989, WB Saunders."}
