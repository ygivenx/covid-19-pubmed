{"title": "Why G3139 works poorly in cancer trials but might work well against HIV", "body": "The antisense drug G3139 (oblimersen sodium, Genta, Inc.) is a phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) containing unmethylated CpG units, which is targeted to suppress Bcl-2 [1] [2] [3] [4] . It was expected that reduction of Bcl-2 levels would facilitate apoptosis in drug-resistant cancer cells [1, 2] .\n\nOver the last several years [3, 4] , G3139 has been evaluated in several phase III cancer clinical trials and (unfortunately) it only slightly improves the performance of classical chemotherapeutic agents. I hypothesize that this disappointment is in part due to the fact that most cancer clones have lost p53 activity [5] . Internal stresses of various sorts (metabolic, physical, genotoxic) are communicated to p53 via independent signaling pathways and p53 integrates them into a single level of cellular stress that activates p21 to slow down the cell cycle [6] . If delaying the cell cycle does not allow the cellular stress to be mitigated (e.g., by DNA repair; restoration of pH, Eh or nutrient levels; metabolism or excretion of toxins), then activated p53 reaches a level that summons pro-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bax and Bak), which initiate apoptosis [7] . Bcl-2 fine-tunes the threshold of stress at which apoptosis occurs by blocking the action of the pro-apoptotic proteins (Fig. 1) .\n\nThis p53-dependent pathway is apparently absent in the majority of cancer clones as shown by the utility of p53 gene therapy (e.g., with Ad5CMV-p53, Advexin(R), Introgen Therapeutics, Inc.) [8] . Thus, suppression of Bcl-2 in combination with classical chemotherapy, which induces internal stress (e.g., genotoxicity), cannot have much positive effect on apoptosis of abnormal cells [4] . On the other hand, it would appear that a combination of drugs that: (i) restores p53 activity, (ii) suppresses Bcl-2, (iii) induces internal stress in cancer cells, and (iv) suppresses cell fusion [9] would be an attractive candidate for clinical trials.\n\nAnother possible reason that G3139 has been of little benefit in cancer clinical trials has to do with the fact that Bcl-2 works to suspend the cell cycle via p27 [10] [11] [12] . In some cancers, this may be the only inhibition remaining to block an uncontrolled cell cycle. Obviously, in this case, suppressing Bcl-2 would be undesirable unless it led immediately to apoptosis.\n\nFinally, G3139 has another important feature. Namely, it is an unmethylated CpG compound that has been extensively tested in clinical trials. Unmethylated CpG compounds are known to stimulate immune response by activating leucocytes [13] . This would appear to have desirable anti-cancer effects and may, indeed, account for some of the G3139 benefit in pre-clinical studies, but as shown in Fig. 1 , Bcl-2 actually plays an important role in inducing apoptosis triggered by external death signals. Specifically, binding of Fas (CD95) on the cell surface (by FasL, TNF, etc.) activates caspase-3, which cleaves Bcl-2 into pro-apoptotic Bax-like fragments [14] . Ironically, G3139 suppresses Bcl-2 such that the benefit of the enhanced immune response (external stress) against tumors appears to be largely lost. Indeed, this effect of G3139 appears to lead to significant adverse toxicity in cancer trials. G3139 has been shown to suppress Bcl-2 in T-cells, Bcells and monocytes [3] . The combination of activation of immune cells and blocking their Bcl-2 expression leads to substantial apoptosis and neutropenia and thrombocytopenia [4] . It seems clear that G3139 is having an effect in the cells that become infected with HIV [15, 16] . It is probably undesirable to treat individuals who have very low levels of T-cells with G3139. If, however, T-cell levels have been stabilized with HAART [17] , then G3139 may well activate transcription of the latent HIV provirus inducing internal stress in the infected T-cells that is not present in the uninfected (bystander) T-cells. Bcl-2 over-expression is essential for the survival of HIV-infected cells that are actively transcribing the provirus [18, 19] . Hence, without the benefit of elevated Bcl-2, these activated, HIVinfected T-cells should preferentially undergo apoptosis. At the same time, lowering the Bcl-2 levels in bystander T-cells makes them less susceptible to external death signals. Thus, suppression of Bcl-2 should concurrently protect uninfected cells from the ravages of HIV-infected T-cells.\n\nThis hypothesis was originally published in 2004 [20, 21] and to my knowledge, no one with means to test it has given it serious consideration. The results of G3139 clinical trials have greatly reduced the enthusiasm for G3139 as an anti-cancer drug. But, the report [22] that G3139 has successfully eliminated EBV+ nasopharyngeal carcinoma xenografts in SCID mice suggests that the drug does eliminate the barriers to viral (internal) stress induced apoptosis. If it turns out that HIV suppresses cellular p53 [23, 24] as well as causing over-expression of cellular Bcl-2, then steps to restore p53 function might be necessary."}
