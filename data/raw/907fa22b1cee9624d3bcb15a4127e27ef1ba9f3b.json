{"title": "Cerebral regulatory T cells restrain microglia/macrophage- mediated inflammatory responses via IL-10", "body": "Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) + regulatory T (Treg) cells maintain immune tolerance and prevent inflammation to modulate immune homeostasis [1] . Although the development and activities of Treg cells are best characterized in the lymphoid tissues, emerging evidence indicates they also sustain immune homeostasis in non-lymphoid tissues such as skin [2, 3] , skeletal muscle [4, 5] , visceral adipose tissue [5, 6] , and the central nervous system (CNS) [7] . Studies of Treg cells in the CNS mainly focus on CNS disorders such as multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [8] , Alzheimer's disease [9, 10] , ischemia [11] and gliobastoma [12, 13] . In such disorders the compromised blood brain barrier (BBB) allows for the entry of T lymphocytes including Treg cells into the CNS parenchyma. Similar to their functions in the periphery, these infiltrating Treg cells can inhibit immune responses to CNS antigens and restrain neuroinflammation thereby maintaining immune homeostasis, so as to protect the CNS tissues [7] . However, the existence and significance of Treg cells in the normal CNS regions such as the cerebrum is completely unknown.\n\nThe cerebrum is an immune-privileged tissue due to the presence of BBB and the lack of lymphatic vessels. It was once considered that T lymphocytes cannot extravasate the intact BBB to reach the cerebral parenchyma in the steady state [14] . However, recent findings demonstrated that T lymphocytes are present in both normal human cerebrospinal fluid [15, 16] and the normal CNS parenchyma [17] [18] [19] . It has been speculated that these T lymphocytes could contribute to immune surveillance, immune tolerance and immune memory in the CNS. Therefore, Treg cells could also be present in the normal CNS with other T-cell subsets.\n\nIn this study, we found that TCR \u03b1\u03b2 + CD4 + Foxp3 + Treg cells are present in the normal rat cerebrum. Compared with their peripheral counterpart, these Treg cells are phenotypically activated/memory T cells and express higher levels of Treg-cell-associated signature genes. More importantly, in vitro assay demonstrated that cerebral Treg cells can effectively suppress the activation of conventional T cells (Tconv cells). In addition, cerebral Treg cells significantly inhibit the LPS-induced inflammatory response of brain microglia/ macrophages in vitro, suggesting they could be important for restraining microglia/ macrophage-mediated neuroinflammation. Our study also demonstrated that astrocytes contribute to maintaining the Foxp3 level of Treg cells, suggesting the interaction between Treg cells and astrocytes is crucial for Treg-cell maintenance and function in the normal cerebrum. Our work is the first to characterize the phenotype and function of Treg cells in the normal rat brain. Investigation on the Treg cells in the normal cerebrum will be helpful for understanding the immune homeostasis of the CNS under steady state.\n\nAs shown in Supporting Information Fig. 1A , a TCR \u03b1\u03b2 + cell population was present in mononuclear cells isolated from cerebral hemispheres. The ratio of CD4 + to CD8 + T-cell subsets in the cerebrum was about 0.7 (Supporting Information Fig. 1C) , which is consistent with a previous report [18] . Within cerebral CD4 + T cells, Foxp3 + cells constitute about 15% of CD4 + T cells. The frequency of Foxp3 + cells in cerebral CD4 + T cells was 2~3 folds higher than that in blood or splenic CD4 + T cells ( Figure 1A) . However, the percentage of CD4 + Foxp3 + cells in total cerebral T cells was comparable to that in total splenic T cells (Supporting Information Fig. 1D ). An average of 890.1 \u00b1 136.3 (N=6) cerebral CD4 + Foxp3 + T cells were recovered using our method (Supporting Information Fig. 1E ). Immunocytochemistry for Foxp3 in sorted TCR \u03b1\u03b2 + CD4 + cells confirmed that Foxp3 + cells were present in cerebral T cells. The Foxp3 staining in cerebral T cells was broader than in blood T cells, seemingly being distributed in larger nuclei ( Figure 1B) . We gave the name \"cerebral Treg cells\" to these cerebral TCR \u03b1\u03b2 + CD4 + Foxp3 + cells. In addition, Foxp3 protein levels were comparable among blood, splenic and cerebral Treg cells, while cerebral Treg cells expressed higher CD25 (Fig, 1C-D) .\n\nPrevious studies showed that T cells found in the CNS have an activated/memory phenotype [15, 20] . To characterize the phenotype of cerebral Treg cells, we determined expression of activation/memory surface markers on cerebral TCR \u03b1\u03b2 + CD4 + Foxp3 + cells. Firstly, we confirmed that the cell isolation procedure did not significantly alter the surface marker staining (Supporting Information Fig. 2) . We found that about 13% of splenic Treg cells were activated/memory cells (CD44H + CD62L lo/\u2212 ). Over 80% cerebral Treg cells were CD44H + CD62L \u2212 , suggesting they are activated/memory T cells (Figure 2A) . Consistently, compared with splenic Treg cells, very few cerebral Treg cells expressed CD45RC, which is a na\u00efve T-cell marker ( Figure 2B ). Cerebral Treg cells expressed higher levels of other activation/memory markers including ICOS, CD103, KLRG1 and CTLA4 in comparison with splenic Treg cells (Figure 2C-D) . Notably, cerebral Treg cells contained increased CD103 + ICOS + cells and CD103 \u2212 ICOS + cells (Supporting Information Fig. 3A) . A CTLA4 + KLRG1 + subpopulation, which was absent in splenic Treg cells, existed in cerebral Treg cells (Supporting Information Fig. 3B ). Compared with their splenic counterparts, cerebral TCR \u03b1\u03b2 + CD4 + Foxp3 \u2212 Tconv cells also show an activated/memory phenotype ( Figure 2 ).\n\nTo investigate the locations of cerebral Treg cells, we determined the presence of TCR \u03b1\u03b2 + CD4 + Foxp3 + cells in dissected cerebral regions. As shown in Figure 3A -B, T cells were present in all cerebral regions tested, with cortex containing the most T cells and hippocampus containing the least. The ratio of CD4 + to CD8 + T cells was much lower in the cortex, subcortex and hippocampus in comparison with that in the spleen, while in the choroid plexus this ratio was relatively close to that in spleen ( Figure 3C ). Cortex and subcortex contained a significantly higher Treg-cell proportion, suggesting cerebral Treg cells are mainly located in these regions ( Figure 3D ). The CD4 + Foxp3 + T-cell fraction in the choroid plexus was comparable to that in the spleen ( Figure 3D ).\n\nTo determine the immunoregulatory activity of cerebral Treg cells, we used qRT-PCR to test the expression of regulatory activity-associated molecules in a cerebral Treg-enriched population. Firstly TCR \u03b1\u03b2 + CD4 + CD25 hi cells either in periphery or in the cerebrum were confirmed to be Foxp3-expressing cells (Supporting Information Fig. 4A-B) . Compared with splenic Treg cells, there was an insignificant increase of TGF-\u03b21 expression in cerebral Treg cells. Robust elevation of expression of IL-10 and IL-35 (both Ebi3 and IL-12a subunits) in cerebral Treg cells was observed ( Figure 4A) . Expression of CTLA4, CD39, CD73 and LAG3 were all significantly higher in cerebral Treg cells than in splenic Treg cells ( Figure 4B ). Intracellular staining confirmed higher IL-10 level in cerebral Treg cells compared with splenic Treg cells ( Figure 4C & Supporting Information Fig. 5 ). The high expression of regulatory molecules suggested that cerebral Treg cells would be immunosuppressive. To test the immunosuppressive function of cerebral Treg cells, CD3 + CD4 + CD25 hi Treg-enriched cells were sorted and were in vitro co-cultured with CFSE-labeled splenic CD4 + CD25 \u2212 Tconv cells in the presence of agonistic antibodies. Compared with Tconv cells cultured alone, both cerebral and splenic Treg cells effectively inhibited Tconv proliferation ( Figure 4D ). In addition, both cerebral and splenic Treg cells significantly restrained production of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 in stimulated Tconv cells, suggesting their significant immunosuppressive activity ( Figure 4E) . However, inconsistent with the higher regulatory molecule expression by cerebral Treg cells, the immunosuppressive effect of cerebral Treg cells was not higher than that of splenic Treg cells. This could be due to the presence of agonistic antibodies in the culture system, because they could also activate splenic Treg cells to generate a strong suppressive activity.\n\nIn the periphery, Treg cells are essential for controlling inflammatory response. We speculated that cerebral Treg cells also modulate neuroinflammation to maintain brain homeostasis. Microglia and perivascular macrophages are important for the initiation and progression of neuroinflammation through the production pro-inflammatory mediators. To identify the anti-inflammatory activity of cerebral Treg cells, we co-cultured splenic or cerebral Treg cells with LPS-stimulated cerebral microglia/macrophage mixture. Then Treg cells were depleted and myeloid cells were analyzed for inflammatory response (Supporting Information Fig. 6A ). Microglia and macrophages can be distinguished by their differential expression of CD45 (Supporting Information Fig. 6B ). We used rat MHC-II (RTIB) and CD163 as the markers of macrophage polarization, since RTIB expression is up-regulated in pro-inflammatory macrophages, and CD163 expression is upregulated in anti-inflammatory macrophages. LPS-activated macrophages expressed high RTIB and low CD163. Naive splenic Treg cells did not significantly alter RTIB and CD163 expression ( Figure 5A-B) . Notably, cerebral Treg cells significantly decreased RTIB expression and increased CD163 expression in comparison with macrophages alone or cocultured with splenic Treg cells ( Figure 5A-B) , suggesting cerebral Treg cells restrained macrophage polarization towards pro-inflammatory M1 type. However, RTIB and CD163 were barely expressed on microglia even after LPS stimulation, so it was difficult to distinguish the phenotypical change of microglia. Subsequently, we determined the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 in LPS-stimulated microglia/macrophage mixture. Splenic Treg cells could not significantly inhibit expression of these cytokines, while cerebral Treg cells profoundly decreased each of them, suggesting the inhibitory effect of cerebral Treg cells was more robust than splenic Treg cells ( Figure  5C ).\n\nIn the previous data we demonstrated that cerebral Treg cells express higher IL-10 than splenic Treg cells ( Figure 4A ). Thus, IL-10 could be involved in the anti-inflammatory function of cerebral Treg cells. To test our hypothesis, a neutralizing antibody against IL-10 was added into the co-culture and inflammatory responses in microglia and macrophages were determined as in Figure 5C . As shown in Figure 6 , IL-10 antibody attenuated the inhibitory effect of cerebral Treg cells, resulting in up-regulation of RTIB and downregulation of CD163 on macrophages, as well as partially restored production of proinflammatory cytokines in the microglia/macrophage mixture. However, other mediators such as IL-35, CTLA4 and CD39 might also play roles in suppressing inflammation. To exclude the possibility that IL-10 antibody directly alters inflammatory response, we incubated LPS-stimulated microglia/macrophages with IL-10 antibody. IL-10 antibody itself did not alter expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in LPS-stimulated microglia/ macrophages (Supporting Information Fig. 6C ).\n\nThe above results led us to investigate the mechanisms by which the brain influences Treg function. Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the brain and are part of the BBB. Therefore astrocytes could be the first brain parenchymal cell type encountered by Treg cells. We co-cultured splenic T cells with primary astrocytes and the frequency of Foxp3 + T cells was then determined. Co-cultured T cells contained a significantly higher proportion of Foxp3 + cells in CD4 + T cells, suggesting astrocytes maintain and/or increase Treg frequency ( Figure 7A ). Moreover, Foxp3 expression was higher in co-cultured T cells than in those cultured alone ( Figure 7B ). The proportional change of Treg cells in the co-culture could be due to maintenance or induction of Foxp3 expression, or less Treg apoptosis. To test these possibilities, splenic CD3 + CD4 + CD25 hi Treg-enriched cells or CD3 + CD4 + CD25 \u2212 Tconv cells were cultured in the presence or absence of astrocytes, respectively. We observed a progressive decrease of Foxp3 + T cells when Treg cells were cultured alone ( Figure 7C ). Astrocytes maintained the proportion of Foxp3 + T cells, suggesting Foxp3 expression in Treg cells was sustained by astrocytes ( Figure 7D -E). In addition, astrocytes could not induce Foxp3 expression in Tconv cells ( Figure 7D -E). Astrocytes significantly reduced apoptosis of both Tconv and Treg cells after a 24 h co-culture, suggesting support of cell survival could be a mechanism underlying the Treg-cell maintenance ( Figure 7F ).\n\nThe effect of astrocytes on maintenance of Treg cells indicates they could be a substitute for Tconv cells in support of Treg cells. Tconv cell-derived interleukin-2 (IL-2) maintains Treg cells in the periphery [21] . Previous studies indicated that astrocytes can also produce IL-2 both in vitro and in vivo [22] [23] [24] [25] . Moreover, previous research showed that astrocytes can produce transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) [26, 27] , a potent Foxp3-inducing cytokine. Since STAT5 is critical for the IL-2 signal pathway, we firstly used a STAT5 inhibitor and/or TGF-\u03b2 RI kinase inhibitor VI (SB431542) in the co-culture to block the STAT5 and/or TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Only the STAT5 inhibitor effectively decreased the frequency of Foxp3 + T cells ( Figure 8A ). To further confirm the role of STAT5, we determined STAT5 phosphorylation in Treg cells after co-culture with astrocytes. The STAT5 phosphorylation level was significantly higher in co-cultured Treg cells than in Treg cells alone, suggesting STAT5 is indeed activated in co-cultured Treg cells ( Figure 8B ). ELISA demonstrated low but substantial IL-2 in 24 h astrocyte supernatant, suggesting at least in vitro cultured astrocytes can produce IL-2 ( Figure 8C ). Subsequently, we used an anti-IL-2 neutralizing antibody to block the potential effect of IL-2. Consistent with our expectation, the neutralizing antibody abolished astrocyte-induced maintenance of Foxp3 + cells during a 24hour culture ( Figure 8D) . However, the above data were all generated from splenic Treg cells. To further confirm the effect of astrocyte-derived IL-2 on cerebral Treg cells, we cocultured a small quantity of cerebral Treg cells with astrocytes for 24 hours. Due to the difficulty in staining Foxp3 in such few cells, we sorted T cells from the co-culture instead and used qRT-PCR to determine the expression of Foxp3. Consistent with splenic Treg cells, cerebral Treg cells maintained Foxp3 expression at a relatively high level, in comparison with Treg cells alone ( Figure 8E) . Therefore, IL-2/STAT5 signaling is involved in astrocyte-mediated maintenance of Treg cells. It is likely that astrocytes support the expression of Foxp3 in existing Treg cells, rather than inducing Foxp3 expression in Tconv cells.\n\nIt is possible that astrocytes maintain Treg-cell identity through signaling triggered by MHC-II and co-stimulatory molecules on astrocytes. To test this possibility, we tested expression of MHC-II and CD80 on primary astrocytes by flow cytometry. We found that both MHC-II and CD80 were expressed at very low levels on astrocytes, and less than 3% of astrocytes express both molecules (Supporting Information Fig. 8A) . Hence, it is unlikely that astrocytes induce significant signaling in Treg cells through MHC-II and CD80, at least in our experimental settings.\n\nWe further tested whether Treg-derived IL-10 could induce IL-2 expression in astrocytes. Astrocytes were treated with 10 \u03bcg/ml rat IL-10 for 24 hs and IL-2 concentration in the supernatant was analyzed by ELISA. We did not observe significant changes in IL-2 levels, suggesting IL-10 is not important for inducing IL-2 expression in astrocytes (Supporting Information Fig. 8B ).\n\nThe potent immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory activities of Treg cells make them crucial for maintenance of immune homeostasis. However, it remains elusive whether Treg cells have different subtypes which play distinct roles in different organs and tissues. Under steady state, Treg cells are present in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. The Tregcontaining normal non-lymphoid tissues include skin, lung, liver, and intestinal lamina propria [5] . Altering the distribution of Treg cells leads to the development of tissue-specific inflammatory disease [28] . Until recently the presence of Treg cells in the normal cerebrum has not been carefully studied, probably because the cerebrum has long been considered an immune-privileged tissue. Some studies have shown the existence of T cells in the normal cerebrum [18, 19] . As an important T-cell subset, Treg cells might also be present in the cerebrum. Our study showed a substantial TCR \u03b1\u03b2 + CD4 + Foxp3 + Treg population in the rat brain. The fraction of Treg cells in cerebral CD4 + T cells was higher than that in splenic CD4 + T cells, similar to the case in skin [5] . In cerebral Treg cells, Foxp3 was more broadly stained in the nuclei in comparison to the blood Treg cells. We speculated it might be related to the activation status of these cells [29] .\n\nBlood Treg cells are likely the source of cerebral Treg cells, due to lack of lymphatic vessels and abundance of blood vasculature in the brain [14] . There are two possible sites for leukocyte entry into the brain. One is the choroid plexus, which lacks tight junction between vascular endothelial cells and the glia limitans [14] . Leukocytes enter the CSF through this site, but whether they can go further into the brain parenchyma has not been determined. The second site is the vascular network in the subventricular zone (SVZ). SVZ contains a rich plexus of blood vessels that has a leaky BBB, with areas along the blood vessel that lack endothelial tight junctions, pericytes and astrocytic end feet [30, 31] . If Treg cells can cross the SVZ microvessels, they would easily enter the parenchyma proximal to the vasculature. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that large brain blood vessels could be the site of Treg recruitment. Furthermore, recruitment of Treg cells into non-lymphoid tissues require different sets of adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors, which bind to corresponding ligands expressed in specific tissues [5] . Future studies on the expression of adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors will provide more details about the homing of Treg cells into the brain.\n\nIt should be noted that cerebral Treg cells have an activated/memory phenotype. This phenomenon is consistent with previous publications, stating that most T cells found in the normal CNS have an activated/memory phenotype [15, 16, 20] . Consistent with activated/ memory phenotype, cerebral Treg cells express higher levels of regulatory activityassociated molecules. In vitro suppression assays confirmed the immunosuppression induced by cerebral Treg cells. However, it is still not clear whether the activated/memory state is acquired before or after Treg cells enter the brain. It has long been considered that activated T cells can relatively easily extravasate the blood brain barrier, probably because of their altered expression profile of adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors [32] [33] [34] [35] . Hence, activated/memory Treg cells in the blood vasculature might efficiently penetrate the BBB to enter the brain. However we cannot exclude the possibility that na\u00efve Treg cells become activated after they contact the cellular or humoral components of the brain.\n\nAlthough Treg cells are widely spread in the normal brain, the significance of their existence is still not understood. We hypothesized that cerebral Treg cells might contribute to the antiinflammatory feature of the brain. Cerebral Treg-derived IL-10, TGF-\u03b2 and IL-35 might work together to maintain the homeostasis of the brain. In addition, previous data have shown that Treg cells can maintain or promote polarization of macrophages towards antiinflammatory M2 type [36, 37] , and tissue-resident macrophages generate Foxp3 + regulatory T cells and promote immune tolerance [38] . Thus, cerebral Treg cells might interact with microglia/macrophages to restrain neuroinflammation. Our data suggest that cerebral Treg cells are able to inhibit LPS-induced inflammatory response of microglia/ macrophages. It is possible that cerebral Treg cells could react with and fight against some stress-or-injury-induced neuroinflammatory responses such as in ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, cerebral Treg cells could also play a critical role in suppressing the autoimmune response against the brain tissue in the steady state. Note that cerebral Tconv cells are also activated/memory cells. These Tconv cells could be responsive to cerebral antigens, and cerebral Treg cells might suppress the responsiveness of cerebral Tconv cells. Interestingly, previous studies have indicated that mononuclear cells within the CNS suppress the response of myelin basic protein-specific T cells [18] . The cerebral Treg cells are likely involved in this suppression. The exact role of cerebral Treg cells in maintaining brain homeostasis needs further investigation.\n\nIn normal brains, Treg cells might lose the support for survival and function from bloodderived cellular and humoral components. Hence, they would acquire the supporting signals from the brain components. Previous research indicates that in vitro cultured neurons can generate Foxp3 + Treg cells from encephalitogenic T cells and suppress experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [39] . Another major cerebral cell type -astrocytes -may interact with Treg cells as well. Astrocytes are the most abundanT-cell population in the CNS [40, 41] . Previous studies have suggested some interactions between astrocytes and T lymphocytes under pathological conditions [42] [43] [44] [45] . Our data demonstrates that primary astrocytes maintain the Foxp3 expression in Treg cells via IL-2/STAT5 signaling. Hence, astrocytes could be a partial substitute for Tconv cells in the maintenance of Treg cells. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing evidence for the effect of astrocytes on Foxp3 + Treg cells.\n\nIn summary, our study has provided novel insight for the homeostatic maintenance of immunomodulation in the normal brain. We postulate that Treg cells are also present in the normal brains of other species such as mice and humans. Further studies are needed to elucidate the significance of cerebral Treg cells under pathological conditions.\n\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats (8~12 week old, weighing 250~300g) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. All animal procedures were approved by the University of North Texas Health Science Center Animal Care and Use Committee. All experiments were conducted in compliance with institutional guidelines and NIH Guidelines for the Use of Animals in Neuroscience and Behavioral Research.\n\nIsolation of brain mononuclear cells was performed following the well-established method with a few modifications [46, 47] . Briefly, anesthetized rats were cardially perfused with 250 ml of ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Each cerebral hemisphere was digested with RPMI1640 containing 1 mg/ml collagenase type IV (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 U/ml DNase I (Roche), 5 mM CaCl 2 and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) for 45 min at 37\u00b0C. Released cells were then subjected to Percoll (GE Healthcare) gradient isolation by centrifugation at 500 g for 20 min. The cells in the interlayer between 37% Percoll and 70% Percoll were collected. \n\nTotal RNAs were extracted using PicoPure \u00ae RNA Isolation Kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacture's manual. cDNAs synthesis was performed using SuperScript \u00ae III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) according to the manufactures' instructions. Quantitative PCR was performed using Fast SYBR\u00ae Green Master Mix (Invitrogen) on a 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Invitrogen). 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394Ct method was used to calculate relative expression of each gene. Primer sequences are shown in Table 1 .\n\nFACS-Sorted TCR \u03b1\u03b2 + CD4 + cells were seeded on glass slides coated with 0.01% poly-Llysine (Sigma-Aldrich) and were air-dried for 30 min. Cells were fixed and permeabilized with Foxp3 Fix/Perm Buffer Set (BioLegend). Cells were stained with Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 anti-Foxp3 (150D). For astrocytes, cells were fixed with BD Cytofix/perm buffer, permeabilized with BD perm/wash buffer and then were incubated with anti-rat GFP monoclonal Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Astrocytes were washed and incubated with Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen). Cells were observed on an Axio Observer Z1 fluorescent microscope (Zeiss).\n\nFor T-cell activation assay, 96-well half-area microplates (Greiner Bio-One) were coated with 500 \u03bcg/ml sheep anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Microplates were then washed with PBS and coated with 5\u03bcg/ml mouse anti-rat TCR \u03b1\u03b2 Ab (R73, BioLegend) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. FACS-sorted splenic CD3 + CD4 + CD25 \u2212 conventional T cells (Tconv cells) were labeled with 5 \u03bcM Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE, Molecular Probes) following the manufacture's instructions. 1 \u00d7 10 4 Tconv cells were then co-cultured with 1 \u00d7 10 3 CD3 + CD4 + CD25 hi Treg-enriched cells in supplemented RPMI 1640 containing 200 ng/ml mouse anti-rat CD28 Ab (JJ319, BioLegend) and 300 U natural IL-2 (Gibco) for 4 days. At day 2 after stimulation, CFSE + Tconv cells were sorted by flow cytometry and were subject to RNA extraction and qRT-PCR. At day 4 after stimulation, CFSE dilution was evaluated by flow cytometry.\n\nMicroglia/macrophage inflammatory response was induced based on previous study with modifications [37] . Briefly, CD11b/c + microglia/macrophages in the rat cerebrum were sorted by FACS and were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1% penicillin/ streptomycin, 1% glutamine, and 10% heat-inactivated FCS. 1 \u00d7 10 5 per ml Microglia/ macrophages were stimulated for 6 h with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 50ng/ml, Sigma). The cells were then washed with PBS twice and were mixed with 2.5 \u00d7 10 4 per ml TCR \u03b1\u03b2 + CD4 + CD25 hi Treg-enriched cells freshly isolated from either spleen or cerebrum.\n\nThe cell mixture was cultured in the 96-well untreated round bottom microplates (Greiner Bio-One) for 40 h. The cells were then incubated with 5 mM EDTA-PBS at 37 \u00b0C for 15 min followed by vigorous pipetting. Detached cells were incubated with 5 \u03bcg/ml biotinylated anti-rat CD3 Ab (OX-19, BioLegend) on ice for 15 min followed by depletion of CD3 + cells with Dynabeads\u00ae Biotin Binder kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Unbound CD3 \u2212 cells were subject to flow cytometry and qRT-PCR. In some experiments, 1 \u03bcg/ml neutralizing polyclonal goat anti-mouse/rat IL-10 IgG (R&D systems) was added into culture.\n\nPrimary astrocyte culture was performed as described [48] . 1 \u00d7 10 5 per ml astrocytes were seeded into each well of 48-well plates and cultured overnight to reach 80%~90% confluent. Splenic T cells (CD3 + total T cells, CD4 + CD25 hi Treg cells or CD4 + CD25 \u2212 Tconv cells, respectively) were sorted by FACS. T cells were seeded onto the astrocyte monolayer and were cultured at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator for indicated periods of time. The ratio of T cells to astrocytes was 1:2. In some experiments, 100 \u03bcM STAT5 inhibitor, 10 \u03bcM TGF-\u03b2 RI kinase inhibitor VI (Cat# 573108 and 616461, respectively.
