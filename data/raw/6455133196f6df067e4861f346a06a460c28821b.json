{"title": "", "body": "Sabine Meijvis and colleagues (June 11, p 2023) 1 investigated the role of adjuvant dexamethasone in community-acquired pneumonia. The primary outcome was median length of hospital stay, which was reported to be signifi cantly shorter in the dexamethasone group (6\u00b75 days) than in the placebo group (7\u00b75 days).\n\nHowever, Meijvis and col leagues do not show clinical or radiological cure rates with or without adjuvant dexamethasone therapy. In light of the poor clinical effi cacy of steroids for pneumonia in previous studies, 2,3 a median diff erence of 1 day in length of hospital stay could easily be attributed to confounders such as variations in clinician behaviour and family assess ment of a patient's readiness for discharge. 4 Meijvis and colleagues should also have provided some absolute measures of treatment eff ect. We calculated the absolute risk reduction and number needed to treat to benefi t, along with 95% CIs, for the outcome of hospital admission (webappendix). 5 Data were derived from fi gure 2 of the published study. We found that the absolute risk of remaining in hospital was 15% and 12% lower in the dexamethasone group than in the placebo group at days 8 and 12, respectively. Furthermore, we found that seven and eight patients with communityacquired pneumonia would need to be treated with adjuvant dexamethasone therapy (versus placebo) to result in early discharge of one additional patient on days 8 and 12 of hospital admission, respectively.\n\nNotably, a signifi cantly higher rate of hyperglycaemia was shown in the dexamethasone group (43%) than in the placebo group (23%; p<0\u00b70001). Again for ease of clinical interpretation, we calculated the number needed to treat to harm, and it was 5 (95% CI 3-9). This fi nding indicates that, for every fi ve patients treated with dexamethasone (versus placebo), one additional patient would have hyperglycaemia.\n\nOverall, in terms of risk-benefi t assessment, the estimated ratio between the number needed to harm and number needed to benefi t (5/7 or 5/8) of less than unity does not fully support Meijvis and colleagues' claims of clinical meaningfulness of adjuvant dexamethasone therapy in community-acquired pneumonia.\n\nWe declare that we have no confl icts of interest. Respiratory viruses are increasingly recognised as major causes of community-acquired pneumonia world wide (up to about 20%), 2 and infl uenza virus is the most important pathogen, causing excessive hospital admissions and deaths, particularly during the seasonal peaks and pandemics.\n\nEvidence suggests that corticosteroid use in infl uenza pneumonia cannot control excessive infl ammation, but compromises the immune response, leading to longer viral shedding, secondary bacterial and fungal infections, and even increased mortality (webappendix). 3, 4 Controlled studies are needed to address the use of corticosteroids in viral pneumonia and its safety. Notably, in viral pneumonia caused by the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, increased viral load has been documented with corticosteroid treatment in a randomised trial. 5 Given the diff erences in immunopathogenesis between viral and bacterial pneumonia, and the uncertainties in effi cacy and safety, 4 we recommend that corticosteroids should not be used routinely in known viral community-acquired pneumonia, especially infl uenzarelated. In this regard, availability of rapid and reliable diagnostics for the causes of communityacquired pneumonia is important to guide antimicrobial treatments (targeted, susceptible antibacterials; or antivirals such as neuraminidase inhibitors), and the use of adjuvant corticosteroids. 2, 4 We declare that we have no confl icts of interest. community-acquired pneumonia with corticosteroids are formalised. Finally, the single case of gastric perforation, potentially caused by the trial drug, might be of greater signifi cance if the benefi cial eff ects of corticosteroids are in doubt. 5 We declare that we have no confl icts of interest. Sabine Meijvis and colleagues 1 conclude that dexamethasone can reduce length of hospital stay in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. We would like to add some comments. Their study addressed a selected population. Of patients admitted to hospital with community-acquired pneumonia, only 43% were enrolled. Of these patients, those requiring admission to the intensive-care unit (ICU) were excluded from the analysis of the length of hospital stay.\n\nThe rationale for defi ning ICU admission during the hospital stay as an endpoint was the systematic prescription of corticosteroids by the intensivists according to the surviving sepsis campaign protocol. 2 However, an update to this protocol 3 suggests that hydrocortisone be given only to patients with septic shock who respond poorly to fl uid and vasopressor therapy.\n\nPrediction of ICU admission of patients with community-acquired pneumonia is random. ICU admission rates and criteria vary widely across diff erent health-care systems, revealing the lack of consensus. 4 Therefore, early identifi cation of patients who will benefi t from dexamethasone therapy seems diffi cult.\n\nMeijvis and colleagues reported a reduction in median length of hospital stay by 1 day with dexamethasone. Daily monitoring and use of C-reactive protein concentrations as one of the criteria for hospital discharge might have favoured dexamethasone. 5 Since Meijvis and colleagues showed only a slight eff ect of dexamethasone on the length of hospital stay and were unable to assess its eff ects on patients secondarily admitted to the ICU, we advocate prudent use of dexamethasone in communityacquired pneumonia until patients who might benefi t from this treatment are better identifi ed.\n\nWe declare that we have no confl icts of interest.\n\nTourcoing Hospital, 59200 Tourcoing, France"}
