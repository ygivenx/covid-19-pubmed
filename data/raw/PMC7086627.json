{"title": "Ratification vote on taxonomic proposals to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (2008)", "body": "In accordance with the Statutes of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), the final stage in the process of making changes to the Universal Scheme of Virus Classification is the ratification of taxonomic proposals by ICTV members. This can occur either at a plenary meeting of ICTV, held during an International Congress of Virology meeting, or by circulation of proposals by mail, followed by a ballot. Therefore, a list of proposals that had been subjected to the full, multi-stage review process was prepared and presented on the ICTVonline web pages in March 2008. This review process involved input from the ICTV study groups and subcommittees, other interested virologists, and the ICTV Executive Committee. For the first time, the ratification process was performed entirely by email. The proposals were sent electronically via email on 18 March 2008, to ICTV Life Members (11), ICTV Subcommittee Members (74), and ICTV National Representatives (53). Members were then requested to vote on whether to ratify the taxonomic proposals, within a 1-month deadline.\n\nInternational Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses attempts to keep an up-to-date list of all members, including National Representatives, but this is a daunting task. As a means of promoting contact between ICTV and its National Members and to ensure that lists of members are up to date, member societies of IUMS are obliged to either renew ICTV National Members or replace them every three years. In effect, National Members have a 3-year tenure that can be renewed indefinitely. National Societies, which are members of the International Union of Microbiological Societies, are encouraged to contact ICTV directly through the ICTV Secretary with the names of their National Representatives. Complete contact information can be obtained from the ICTV web site: http://ictvonline.org.\n\nThe following are the taxonomic proposals that were ratified by ICTV members in April 2008.\n\n\n2005.223V.04 To create a species in the genus Atadenovirus, named Snake adenovirus A.\n\n\n\n2005.224V.04 To create a species in the genus Mastadenovirus, named Simian adenovirus A.\n\n\n2005.212V-215V.04 To create a new genus, Blosnavirus, in the family Birnaviridae with Blotched snakehead virus as the type species.\n\n\n2005.216V-222V.04 To create a new family, Picobirnaviridae, to contain a new genus Picobirnavirus, with Human picobirnavirus as the type species, and Rabbit picobirnavirus as a designated species.\n\n\n2005.119V.04 To create a species in the genus Hantavirus in the family Bunyaviridae, named Saaremaa virus.\n\n\n2004.007V.04 To create a species in the genus Circovirus in the family Circoviridae, named Duck circovirus.\n\n\n2007.081V.04 To create the following species in the genus Circovirus, in the family Circoviridae named Finch circovirus, Gull circovirus, Starling circovirus.\n\n\n2005.260V.04 To create the following species in the genus Coronavirus in the family Coronaviridae, named Goose coronavirus, Pigeon coronavirus, Duck coronavirus.\n\n\n2006.009V.04 To create a species in the genus Coronavirus in the family Coronaviridae, named Human coronavirus NL63.\n\n\n2006.010V.04 To create a species in the genus Coronavirus in the family Coronaviridae, named Human coronavirus HKU1.\n\n\n2006.011V.04 To create a species in the genus Coronavirus in the family Coronaviridae, named Equine coronavirus.\n\n\n2005.020-72V.04 This large set of proposals from the Herpesviridae Study Group achieves a far-reaching update of herpesvirus taxonomy.
