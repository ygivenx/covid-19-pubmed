{"title": "Interferon-inducible antiviral effectors", "body": "Interferon (IFN) was discovered more than 50 years ago as an agent that inhibited the replication of influenza virus 1 . The IFN family of cytokines are now recognized as key components of the innate immune response and the first line of defence against virus infection. Accordingly, IFNs are currently used therapeutically, with the most noteworthy example, to combat Hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection, but also against a range of other disorders, including numerous malignancies and multiple sclerosis (recently reviewed 2 ).\n\nThree classes of IFN have been identified, designated types I to III, which are classified according to the receptor complex they signal through ( Figure 1 ). Type II IFN consists of the single IFN\u03b3 gene product that binds the IFNGR receptor complex. IFN\u03b3 mediates broad immune responses to pathogens other than viruses. The more recently described type III IFNs include three IFN\u03bb gene products that signal via the combined IFNLR1 and interleukin-10 receptor 2 (IL-10R2) receptors. To date little is known about the type III IFNs, although they are known to regulate the antiviral response and have been proposed to be the ancestral type I IFNs 3 . Type I IFNs, which in humans comprise 13 IFN\u03b1 subtypes, IFN\u03b2, IFN\u03ba, IFN\u03b5, IFNo, IFN\u03c4 and IFN\u03b4, engage the ubiquitously expressed IFN\u03b1 receptor (IFNAR) complex that is composed of the two components, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. The function of type I IFNs is well characterized and they are known to be essential for mounting a robust host response against viral infection. Accordingly, IFNAR-deficient mice have increased susceptibility to numerous viruses but maintain resistance to other microbial pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes 4, 5 . Similarly, humans with genetic defects in components of IFN signalling (STAT1, TYK2 or UNC93B) die of viral disease, with the defect in type I IFN (rather than IFN\u03b3) signalling having the more significant role 6-9 .\n\nBinding of type I IFNs to IFNAR, with ensuing signal transduction, leads to the induction of more than 300 IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) 10 . However, relatively few of these ISGs have been directly implicated in instigating the antiviral state. Instead, many of the gene products encode pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) that detect viral molecules and modulate signalling pathways, or transcription factors that form an amplification loop resulting in increased IFN production and protection from virus spread to limit disease. ISGs that encode promising candidates with direct antiviral activity include proteins that catalyse cytoskeletal remodelling, that induce apoptosis and that regulate post-transcriptional events, such as splicing, mRNA editing, RNA degradation and the multiple steps of protein translation, as well as subsequent post-translational modification. Indeed, several such proteins, ISG15, the GTPase Mx1, ribonuclease L (RNaseL) and protein kinase R (PKR) have been validated as antiviral effectors in studies of gene knockout mice. Mice with mutations or deficiency in key steps in the pathways triggered by these proteins have increased susceptibility to virus infection.\n\nIn this Review, we summarize our current understanding of the role of these four antiviral proteins. However, it bears mentioning that this isn't the complete antiviral repertoire. Additional ISGs with likely significant roles in antiviral activities are the deaminases ADAR1 and APOBECS, the exonuclease ISG20, members of the tripartite motif proteins such as PML, the putative S-adenosyl-L-methione Viperin, and the highly induced translation regulators IFIT1 and IFIT2. All have been reported to function as antiviral proteins but await better description for their relative importance using the appropriate knockout models. In addition, responses elicited by IFN-induced microRNA are emerging as regulators of viral infection 11 .\n\nISG15, the Mx proteins, the 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-directed RNaseL pathway and PKR represent a gradient of IFN responsiveness: ISG15 is one of the most highly induced ISGs and when coupled to protein substrates modulates pleiotropic cellular activities; Mx proteins are also highly induced by IFN then self-assemble into oligomers that are constitutively active; OAS proteins are expressed at low levels, then considerably induced by type I IFNs that are subsequently activated by viral RNA; and PKR is constitutively expressed as an inactive kinase that is activated by viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), then further induced by IFN. This variable responsiveness to IFN underlies the function of each protein as solely an IFN effector, or as determinants of innate immunity and PRRs to enhance the IFN response.\n\nOne of the most prominent ISGs induced during viral infection and the ensuing IFN response is the 17 kDa ISG15. Although the gene was cloned over 20 years ago 12 , an antiviral function for ISG15 has only recently been established, and considerable work is still required to detail all of its actions and to resolve contradictory findings.\n\nISG15 was identified soon after the landmark discovery of ubiquitin, and was immediately recognised as a ubiquitin homologue (Figure 2) 13 . Protein ubiquitylation regulates many aspects of immunity, including intracellular signal transduction, for instance via activation of NF-\u03baB, as well as acquired immune functions, such as initiating tolerance (reviewed by Liu et al. 14 ) . Given the importance of ubiquitylation in the immune response, it is perhaps not surprising that there is a tailored IFN-regulated ubiquitin-like protein response. This response, as mediated by ISGs, has been coined ISGylation.\n\nISG15 is expressed as a 165 amino acid precursor that is subsequently processed to expose the C-terminal sequence LRLRGG. The equivalent diglycine residues within this motif on ubiquitin are adenlylated and conjugated by a thiolester bond to sequential cystine residues on the E1-activating, E2-carrier and E3-ligase enzymes, before being transferred to lysine residues on protein substrates. As the ubiquitin E1 enzyme (UBE1) is unable to form a thiolester bond with ISG15, ISGylation was initially thought to require a parallel and distinct pathway 15 . However, as the counterpart enzymes that catalyse ISGylation are identified, it is becoming apparent that there is direct interplay between these two pathways. The enzyme UBE1L (ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1-like) was shown to be the specific ISG15-activating enzyme 16 . Challenging this specificity, two E2 ubiquitin carrier enzymes, UBCH6 (also abbreviated UBE2E1) and UBCH8 (also abbreviated UBE2L6) were shown to also serve as ISG15 carriers 17, 18 . Ablation of UBCH8 by RNAi suggested this as the principal ISG15 E2 carrier in HeLa cells 19 . Finally, two E3 ubiquitin ligases, HERC5 (HECT domain and RLD 5) and TRIM25 (Tripartite Motif Protein 25), have been identified to also conjugate ISG15 to protein substrates, via their respective HECT (Homologous to the E6-Ap Carboxyl Terminus) or RING (Really Interesting New Gene) domains 20, 21 . Appropriately, all enzymes identified in the ISGylation pathway are coordinately induced by IFN ( Figure 3 ). As for ubiquitylation, ISGylation is reversible and a number of enzymes that catalyse the hydrolysis of ISG15 (termed deISGylation) have been identified, including the ubiquitin-specific protease-18 (USP18, also abbreviated UBP43), USP2, USP5, USP13 and USP14 22, 23 .\n\nAt least 158 putative ISG15 target proteins have been identified to date 24-26 . Many of these substrates are important in the IFN response, including the signalling components JAK1 and STAT1, PRRs such as RIG-I (retinoic-acid-inducible gene I), and the antiviral effector proteins MxA, PKR and RNaseL 24 . Unlike ubiquitylation, ISGylation does not drive protein degradation (regulated by K48-linked ubiquitin), but rather parallels ubiquitin's activating effects (mediated by K63-linkage). Accordingly, ISG15 has been reported to prevent virusmediated degradation of the IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), thereby enhancing induction of IFN\u03b2 27 . ISGylation has also been shown to modulate the function of enzymes. An instance of this is the increased affinity of the Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 4E family member 4EHP for the 5\u2032 cap structure of RNA 28 . Conversely, conjugation of ISG15 to the Protein Phosphatase 1B (PPM1B) suppressed enzyme activity, thereby enhancing NF-\u03baB signalling 29 .\n\nIn addition to its intracellular role, ISG15 is secreted in large amounts and has been shown to act as a cytokine to modulate immune responses 30 . The mechanism by which extracellular ISG15 functions is unresolved. Ubiquitin is also secreted from cells with immunomodulatory effects that are not understood 31 . However, extrinsic ubiquitylation has been claimed through analysis of surface proteins on spermatozoa during post-testicular maturation 32 . Conceivably, secreted ISG15 may also function in extrinsic ISGylation. This intriguing possibility could be tested by the treatment of Ube1l-/-mice with ISG15.\n\nCrucial for designation as an antiviral protein, mice ablated for Isg15 have increased susceptibility to a number of viruses, including the influenza A and B viruses, Sindbis virus (SV), and both herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and murine \u03b3-herpesvirus 33, 34 . Supporting this, chimeric SV expressing ISG15 are protected from the otherwise lethality of the wild-type viral infection in Ifnar1-/-mice. Compellingly, this rescue effect was dependent on the integrity of the conserved LRLRGG residues at the C-terminus of ISG15 35 . Confounding these reports, a similar chimeric ISG15-SV did not rescue the same Ifnar1-/-mouse, as reported by another laboratory. However, the recombinant SV construct did provide modest protection in vitro 36 . Ablation of the deISGylation enzyme, USP18, in mice increased resistance to virus infection, notably VSV. However, the expected reciprocal sensitivity to VSV is not apparent in either the Isg15-/-or Ube1l-/-mice 37 . However, Isg15-/-mouse embryonic fibroblasts were more susceptible to VSV infection, although this sensitivity was lost after IFN treatment, suggesting circulating IFNs in vivo may obscure some viral resistance mechanisms 27 . Other in vitro experiments support a role for ISG15 in mediating resistance to Ebola virus, via ISGylation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 (Neural Precursor Cell Expressed, Developmentally Downregulated-4), thereby preventing subsequent ubiquitylation 38 . Similarly, HIV-1 Gag and Tsg101 ubiquitylation is inhibited by ISG15 39 . Both NEDD and Gag/Tsg101 ubiquitylation mediate virion release from cells. Further corroboration of an antiviral role for ISG15 comes from the identification of viral proteins that have evolved to target different steps in ISGylation. The Nonstructural protein-1 (NS1) of the influenza B virus binds ISG15 to block ISGylation 16, 40 . Finally, a number of viral proteases from SARS coronavirus, crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever virus, equine arteritis virus, porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus, and SV have been identified to mediate deISGylation 41-43 .\n\nAs mentioned, one of the substrates modified by ISG15 are the Mx proteins 24 .\n\nIFNs induce the expression of several guanine-hydrolysing proteins. This class of protein is involved in scission to mediate vesicle budding, organogenesis and cytokinesis. There is evidence that four families within this protein class: the p47 guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs), the p65 GBPs, the very large inducible GTPases (VLIGs) and the Mx proteins, afford resistance to pathogens 44 . However, of these only the Mx proteins have a well-characterized antiviral role and show a strict dependence on type I and III IFN for their expression 45 .\n\nThe Mx family of GTPases, which comprises MxA and MxB in humans and Mx1 and Mx2 in mice, were first identified as antiviral proteins by the observation that the sensitivity of many inbred mouse strains to orthomyxomavirus was solely due to arbitrary mutations within the Mx locus on chromosome 16 46-48 . This sensitivity could be rescued by restoration of Mx1 expression 49 . Strikingly, constitutive expression of the human equivalent of mouse Mx1, MxA, in IFNAR-deficient mice confers full resistance to an otherwise fatal infection with Thogoto virus (THOV), LaCrosse Virus (LACV) and Semliki Forest virus (SFV) 49 .\n\nThe two human Mx proteins are encoded on chromosome 21, in a region syngeneic to the Mx region on mouse chromosome 16 50, 51 . The human proteins are cytoplasmic, as is the murine Mx2. However, the murine Mx1 is nuclear. This differential distribution is thought to allow each protein to target viruses that replicate in either cell compartment 52 . Only human MxA has demonstrated antiviral activity, and this is directed against both nuclear and cytosolic viruses.\n\nConsiderable evidence now shows that mouse Mx proteins confer viral resistance. Viruses that are susceptible to the activities of Mx proteins include orthomyxomaviruses, paramyxomaviruses, rhabdoviruses, togaviruses and bunyaviruses. Similarly, human MxA has been shown to inhibit all infectious genera of the Bunyaviridae family (orthobunyavirus, hantavirus, phlebovirus and dugbe virus) 53 . Members of other virus families, such as the clinically significant Coxsackie virus (from the Picornaviridae) and Hepatitis B virus (HBV) (Hepadnaviridae) are also susceptible to MxA 54, 55 . In addition, genetic studies of human populations have shown that a polymorphism in MxA correlates with increased susceptibility to Hepatitis C virus (HCV) 56 and HBV 57 , as well as to measles virus, with the latter associated with higher rates of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis 58 . Appropriately, Mx proteins are expressed in cells of the periphery, for example in hepatocytes, endothelial cells and immune cells, including peripheral blood monocytes, plasmacytoid dendritic cells and myeloid cells 59 .\n\nThe Mx proteins have a large (relative to many GTPases) N-terminal GTPase domain, a central interacting domain (CID) and a C-terminal leucine zipper (LZ) (Figure 2 ). Both the CID and LZ domains are required to recognize target viral structures. The main viral target appears to be viral nucleocapsid-like structures 60 . By virtue of their location at the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, Mx proteins can effectively police exocytic events and mediate vesicle trafficking to trap essential viral components, and in so doing, they prevent viral replication at early time points (Figure 4 ) 61 . Also, both MxA and Mx1 associate with subunits of the influenza virus polymerase (PB2 and nucleocapsid protein) to block transcription 62 . This is a potent antiviral measure, which effectively prevents the generation of viral Mx escape mutants. As a result, few viral countermeasures against Mx proteins have been identified.\n\nMost viral escape mechanisms that are described target IFN signalling: for example, highly virulent strains of influenza virus increase their replicative fitness to effectively out run the IFN response 63 . More directly, the HBV precore/core protein has been reported to interact with the MXA promoter to prevent MXA gene expression 64 . Also, West Nile virus (WNV) produces, what appear to be, decoy cytoplasmic membrane structures to hide crucial replication components 65 .\n\nIn contrast to ISG15 and Mx, the OAS and RNaseL pathways and PKR are present ubiquitiously at constitutive levels but can be amplified by exposure to IFNs.\n\nInitially identified as IFN-induced proteins that generate low-molecular weight inhibitors of cell-free protein synthesis, the OAS proteins are distinguished by their capacity to synthesize 2\u2032, 5\u2032-linked phosphodiester bonds to polymerize ATP into oligomers of adenosine 66, 67 . These unique 2\u2032, 5\u2032-oligomers specifically activate the latent form of RNaseL leading to RNA degradation 68 . In this way, OAS in combination with RNaseL constitutes an antiviral RNA decay pathway. As the OAS proteins are constitutively expressed at low levels they can act as PRRs for the detection of viral dsRNA in the cytosol 65 . RNA degraded by RNaseL is able to activate the other cytoplasmic PRRs RIG-I and MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5) resulting in IFN gene induction. This accounts for the observation that RNaseLdeficient cells show markedly decreased IFN\u03b2 production due to reduced signalling via these PRRs 69 .\n\nThe four OAS genes identified in humans, termed OAS1, OAS2, OAS3 and OASL (OAS-like), have been mapped to chromosome 12 (chromosome 5 in mice) (reviewed by Hovanessian and Justesen 70 ). OAS1 has two spliced forms in humans (eight in mice) that produce two, 40 and 46 kDa, proteins that differ at their C-termini by 18 and 54 amino acids, respectively. OAS2 produces four alternatively spliced transcripts that encode two proteins of 69 and 71 kDa. OAS3 encodes a single transcript that produces a 100 kDa protein. These proteins have considerable homology to each other, with OAS1, OAS2 and OAS3 encoding one, two and three, respectively, 'OAS' domains ( Figure 2 ). The most distinctive of the OAS proteins is OASL. Two OASL transcripts are expressed producing two proteins of 30 and 59 kDa. The higher molecular weight OASL contains a putative nucleolar localization signal (RKVKEKIRRTR) at its C-terminus that, probably, accounts for its unique (from the other OAS isoforms) distribution in the cell. The OASL protein also has an OAS domain, however, mutations at key residues disable the catalytic function of this human protein. Interestingly, one of the two mouse homologues retains its 2\u2032, 5\u2032-polymerase activity. In addition to the OAS domain, OASL has a unique 160 amino acid C-terminus that encodes a ubiquitin-like domain that is homologous to ISG15. Accordingly, OASL becomes conjugated (ISGylation) to cellular proteins following the treatment of cells with type I IFNs 71 .\n\nThere appears to be differential expression and induction of each form of the human OAS proteins 72 . Also, each of the three functional OAS proteins has unique biological functions. A tripeptide motif (CFK) within the OAS domains of OAS1 and OAS2 mediate oligomerization, so the catalytically active form of these enzymes is a tetramer and dimer, for OAS1 and OAS2, respectively 73 . This tripeptide motif is not conserved in the OAS domains of OAS3 and OASL and therefore these proteins function as monomers. The polymerization of OAS monomers influences their processivity, with OAS3 synthesizing dimeric molecules of 2\u2032, 5\u2032-linked oligomers, whereas OAS1 and OAS2 are capable of synthesizing trimeric and tetrameric oligomers 74, 75 . The dimeric 2\u2032, 5\u2032-linked oligomers are not efficient activators of RNaseL 76 and, consequently, are thought to regulate alternative processes, with one report suggesting a role in gene expression by regulating DNA topoisomerase I 77 .\n\nThe 2\u2032, 5\u2032-dependent RNaseL is expressed as an 80 kDa protein with two kinase-like domains (PUG and STYKc) and eight ankyrin repeats ( Figure 2 ) (reviewed by Silverman 78 ) . The enzyme is constitutively expressed as an inactive monomer. Autoinhibition of the enzyme is relieved upon binding of 2\u2032, 5\u2032-oligomers (generated by OAS proteins) to the ankyrin repeats, and subsequent homodimerization 79 . The active dimeric enzyme then degrades ssRNA ( Figure  5 ) 80, 81 . Due to their perceived common action via RNaseL, the antiviral function of the OAS proteins has been investigated using RNaseL-deficient mice 82 . These mice show increased susceptibility to RNA viruses from the Picornaviridae, Reoviridae, Togaviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Flaviviridae and Retroviridae families 78 . An antiviral role for RNaseL against DNA viruses is less directly established, although as these viruses produce dsRNA replicative intermediates they can induce 2\u2032, 5\u2032-oligomers. However, ensuing activation of RNaseL is less commonly observed, presumably because of virally encoded inhibitory factors. A case in point is the E3L protein from Vaccinia virus (VV) 83 . The direct importance of OAS proteins in the antiviral response in humans is highlighted by genetic studies showing that polymorphisms within a splice-acceptor site of the OAS1 gene (producing two isoforms of the enzyme with different activities) significantly correlate with the antiviral response to the yellow fever vaccine in immunization trials 84 .\n\nIt has recently become apparent that the OAS proteins have additional antiviral functions that are independent of RNaseL activity. The precise mechanisms of RNaseL independence remain to be elucidated. Nevertheless, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at a splice enhancer site in OASL have been correlated with susceptibility to WNV 85 . Intriguingly, the capacity to accept GTP has suggested a potential role for OAS in RNA splicing, whereby the enzyme generates a 2\u2032, 5\u2032-phosphodiester bond between the G at the 5\u2032 end of an intron, and the A of a 3\u2032 splice signal in the splicing intermediate structure 86 .\n\nSimilar to OAS, PKR (also known as EIF2\u03b1K2) was initially identified as a regulator of the antiviral response through studies of protein synthesis in cell-free lysates from IFN and dsRNAtreated cells 66, 87 . PKR belongs to a small family of protein kinases that respond to environmental stresses to regulate protein synthesis (the other members are EIF2\u03b1K1 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2\u03b1 kinase 1; also known as HRI), EIF2\u03b1K3 (also known as PERK) and EIF2\u03b1K4 (also known as GCN2)). Members of this kinase family phosphorylate the translation initiation factor EIF2\u03b1 at serine residue 51, resulting in sequestration of the limiting guanine nucleotide exchange factor EIF2\u03b2 88 . This prevents recycling of GDP, halting translation, to allow the cell to reconfigure gene expression. Much of the antiviral and antiproliferative activities of PKR can be attributed to its phosphorylation of EIF2\u03b1. Moreover, structural determination of the complex of EIF2\u03b1 and PKR argues against the existence of alternative substrates 89 . However, there is extensive biological and biochemical evidence for alternative PKR targets, although the consequences of PKR phosphoregulation of other proteins have not been well characterized. As well as directly regulating proteins by phosphorylation, PKR evokes cellular responses by modulating cell-signalling pathways (discussed below).\n\nPKR is constitutively expressed in all tissues at a basal level and is induced by type I and III IFNs 90 . Under normal circumstances, PKR is maintained as an inactive monomer, through steric hindrance of the kinase domain by the N-terminus of the protein (Figure 2 ) 91, 92 . This repression is released by activating ligands, including viral RNAs, polyanionic molecules such as heparin 93 or ceramide 94 , and protein activators 95 that elicit a conformational shift that permits the binding of ATP to the C-terminal kinase domain. The kinase domain consists of two lobes that separately regulate the interaction between protein monomers and the substrate. The active enzyme consists of a homodimer oriented in a parallel, back-to-back arrangement, with the active sites of the enzyme facing outwards 89 . Dimerization elicits, and requires autophosphorylation at several key residues 96-98 . Activation elicits phosphorylation of the EIF2\u03b1 to halt translation ( Figure 6 ).\n\nDirect activation of PKR has been demonstrated with various RNAs by virtue of the two RNAbinding motifs (RBMs) in the N-terminal of PKR. All RBMs tested bind dsRNA independent of sequence, but recognize a specific higher ordered structure. Accordingly, PKR, like the OAS/RNaseL pathway, functions as a PRR. Although RBMs have been shown to bind just 16 base pairs of RNA, longer RNA moieties are required to engage both of the RBMs in PKR to activate the kinase 99 . Consequently, dsRNA that is longer than 30 base pairs activates PKR most effectively. Alternatively, single-stranded RNAs of 47 bases that have limited ternary structure, activate the kinase if they carry 5\u2032-triphosphates 100 . As cellular RNA transcripts predominantly have 5\u2032-monophosphates, this equips PKR to specifically target viral RNAs.\n\nOther pathogen-associated molecules, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is a ligand of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), can also activate PKR 101 , but this is likely indirect, via another protein. Accordingly, three protein activators of PKR have been identified. PKR interacts with the tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family of adaptor molecules that are integral to TLR signalling pathways 102 . The protein activator of PKR PACT responds to stress-inducing molecules, such as hydrogen peroxide, ceramide and cytokines (including IFN\u03b3, IL-3 and TNF) 95 . The consequences of activation of PKR by PACT in an antiviral context await further characterization of PACT-deficient mice. Finally, PKR can be activated by caspase-mediated (caspase-3, caspase-7 and caspase-8) cleavage of its inhibitory N-terminus, to generate a constitutively active, truncated, kinase domain 103, 104 .\n\nThe role of PKR has been investigated in mice using transgenic models. Deletion mutations have targeted both functional domains of the enzyme 105, 106 and transgenic mice that are defective in PKR activity have been generated by expression of a trans-dominant negative mutant of human PKR that is defective in kinase activity (K296R) 107 . Finally, transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type human PKR have also been produced 108 . These transgenic mice have impaired antiviral responses with, for example, increased susceptibility to otherwise innocuous infections with VSV 109, 110 ,  \n\nStudies of the ISG15, OAS/RNaseL and PKR pathways suggest additional functions for each of these proteins. The primary, activating enzyme in ISGylation, UBE1L, was recognized as being deleted in almost all small cell lung cancers, and so the gene product was speculated to be a tumour suppressor 121, 122 . Given the specificity of UBE1L in ISGylation, this presents an intriguing possible mechanism by which IFN could regulate proliferation.\n\nRNaseL-deficient mice have an enlarged thymus and spleen due to suppressed apoptosis 82 . The significance of this ability of RNaseL to induce apoptosis has been exemplified through genetic analysis that identified a polymorphism (R462Q) that was associated with reduced enzyme activity and increased incidence of prostate cancer 123 . Intriguingly, this SNP was subsequently associated with a putative oncolytic xenotropic murine leukaemia-related virus 124 . Other nonviral functions of RNaseL are implied in experiments that show delayed skin-graft rejection in RNaseL-deficient mice 125 . A polymorphism identified in OAS1 has also been associated with type I diabetes, which is consistent with a viral aetiology for this disease 126, 127 . Given that PKR modulates several signalling pathways, a wider function than determined solely by regulation of translation would be expected. As mentioned, PKR is required for TLR4-mediated apoptosis in macrophages. Although PKR-mediated apoptosis is in part attributable to inhibition of translation through EIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, alternative signalling via IRF3 is also important 101 . PKR also promotes degradation of the inhibitor I\u03baB, thereby activating the potent transcription factor NF-\u03baB 128 . Regulation of NF-\u03baB accounts for the diminished NADPH oxidase 2 (NOS2) and IFN\u03b2 expression in PKR-deficient cells 129 . Additionally, PKR was shown to be required for LPS-induced STAT inflammatory signalling 130 . There is also a defect in IFN-induced phosphorylation of serine 727 in STAT1 131 , which is shown to be necessary for the basal expression of caspase-3. Accordingly, PKR-deficient fibroblasts are variably resistant to apoptosis induced by different stimuli, including dsRNA, LPS and TNF 132 . Conversely, over expression of PKR in NIH3T3 fibroblasts sensitises them to apoptosis 103 . PKR may also influence the adaptive immune response by negatively regulating CD8 + T-cell function, as PKR-deficient mice have increased contact hypersensitivity responses and stimulus-dependent T-cell proliferation 133 . PKR has also been implicated in IgE class switching in B cells. This points to a mechanism by which viral infection may induce IgE-mediated disorders, such as allergy and asthma 134, 135 . Surprisingly, these signalling events are not wholly mediated by direct phosphorylation by PKR, suggesting that the kinase acts as a scaffold to bridge signalling pathways from alternative PRRs 136 . The mechanisms underlying these links to adaptive immunity are intriguing but remain to be explained.\n\nThe analyses of mice with targeted deletions in ISG15, Mx1, PKR and RNaseL have helped to elucidate specific roles for these enzymes in the response to virus. Further details of the mechanisms for each of these effectors are still to be elucidated. Less well characterized is the ISG15 pathway. Considerable work is still required to decipher the processes of ISGylation, to characterize protein substrates and to detail the consequence for the antiviral response. Also, the precise function of the Mx proteins remains uncertain. The contribution of alternative PKR substrates (beside EIF2\u03b1) to the immune response are poorly explored, and questions remain about specific roles for PKR in regulating inflammatory responses and whether this requires the kinase function or indicates a role as an adaptor protein. The precise roles of the different OAS proteins, especially relating to RNaseL-independent antiviral effects, are ill-defined. These alternative functions will be better addressed in vivo by the analysis of mice with more subtle targeted mutations, and in vitro by detailed biochemical analyses (for example, by identification of specific phosphorylation sites on substrates for PKR) and by more detailed structural investigation of the mechanism of activation of each protein.\n\nStrategies used by viruses to escape these antiviral pathways are also informative and a large number of viral countermeasures to block ISG15, PKR, RNaseL and Mx have been reported (reviewed78 , 137, 138 ) . It should be noted however, that many of the mechanisms attributed to virus-evolved avoidance of antiviral effectors and enhanced virulence have not been rigorously proven. An exception to this is the mechanism developed by the HSV-1 protein \u03b31ICP34.5 for targeting PKR. In this case, a virus that has been attenuated by deletion of ICP34.5 only replicates as efficiently as wild-type virus when it infects PKR-deficient mice.\n\nRestoration of virulence was shown to depend on ICP34.5 by using both host and viral mutants 139 . Although this approach is not trivial to replicate, it remains the most valid method of defining effective viral avoidance of IFN activity.\n\nAnother important development currently underway is genetic studies that catalogue SNPs in each of these genetic loci within human populations and other animal species. Correlation of genetic polymorphisms in putative antiviral genes with susceptibility to virus, as well as incidence of other immune responses, is emerging as a powerful means to confirm gene function and measure their contribution to disease.\n\nFinally, the most interesting developments in this field are likely to come from further insights into the broader role of each of these antiviral proteins, particularly in mediating adaptive immunity. While the mechanisms underlying these links to adaptive immunity remain to be explained, progress in this area has great potential to realize the goal of manipulating immunity to enhance resistance to pathogens and disease or, alternatively, diminish deleterious autoimmune responses. This will probably also require parallel advancement in our understanding of the specificities of type I and III IFN signalling.\n\n(PRRs). A host receptor that can sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns and initiate signalling cascades that lead to an innate immune response. These can be membrane bound (e.g. TLRs) or soluble cytoplasmic receptors (e.g. RIG-I, MDA5 and NLRs).\n\nplasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). A unique type of dendritic cell with a morphology that resembles that of a plasmablast. These cells are also known as interferon (IFN)-producing cells because they are the main source of type I IFNs during viral infections.\n\nsuppressors of cytokine signalling (SOCS). Intracellular proteins that are cytokine-induced negative regulators of cytokine signalling.\n\n(TRAFs). A family of conserved scaffold proteins that link receptors of the TNF and Toll/IL-1 receptor family to various protein kinases (e.g. IRAK1). These proteins encode RING domains that, by association with E3 ubiquitin ligases, catalyze polyubiquitylation of proteins (e.g. IKKs to activate the transcription factors NF-\u03baB) to transduce signals within the cell.\n\nIFN action is mediated via three receptor complexes: heterodimers between IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 bind type I IFNs; IL10R2 associates with IFNLR1 to bind the three IFN\u03bb; and a tetramer consisting of two IFNGR2 receptor chains with two IFNG1 receptor chains binds dimers of the type II IFN\u03b3. Signal transduction is initiated by pre-associated Janus tyrosine kinases (JAK1 and TYK2), which phosphorylate the IFNAR1 receptor chain enabling recruitment and phosphorylation of the Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs). STAT heterodimers associate with the IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) forming the IFN-stimulated transcription factor (ISGF3), or STAT homodimers form the IFN\u03b3 activation factor (GAF). These complexes translocate to the nucleus to induce IFN-stimulated genes from ISRE or GAS promoter elements, for type I and III, or type II IFN responses, respectively. Divergences from this simplified signalling pathway occur, for instance, type I IFNs are reported to elicit STAT homodimers, and more complicated interplay, with activation of other STAT proteins, occurs than is shown here. Accordingly, the C-terminal UBL is sufficient for activation and transfer to E1 and E2 enzymes. However, the N-terminal UBL appears necessary for, E3-mediated, conjugation to protein substrates. b | Domain structure of the large GTPase MxA. The distinguishing features of the dynamin protein family are the large GTP-binding domain (DTNC) that contains three consensus GTP-binding elements (not indicated) and a self-assembly sequence (SAS), the central interactive domain (CID), and the C-terminal leucine zipper (LZ, also called a GTPase effector domain). The LZ region contains a coiled coil domain at its C-terminus that forms bundles of \u03b1-helices involved in protein-protein interactions. c | Domain structure of OAS proteins and RNaseL. The OAS1, OAS2, OAS3 proteins contain 1, 2, or 3 copies, respectively, of the OAS domains. Duplicated OAS domains within OAS2 and OAS3, and the single domain in OASL are catalytically inactive (indicated by hatched lines). The C-termini of all the OAS proteins are variable, with OASL also encoding a unique ubiquitin-like domain (UBL). The OAS domain produces 2\u2032, 5\u2032-oligodenylates that activate RNaseL. RNaseL has eight Nterminal ankyrin repeats (ANK), which mediate protein-protein interactions, and two kinaselike domains, a Ser/Thr/Tyr kinase (STYLc) and a PUG domain found in some kinases, and a number of other nuclear proteins. However, neither domain has functional kinase activity. d | Domain structure of PKR. PKR contains a repeated RNA-binding motif (RBM), which together constitute the N-terminal RNA-binding domain (RBD). Upon binding of viral RNA, steric ISG15, with the primary activating E1 enzyme UBE1L, and with multiple E2-carrier enzymes (shown here as an example is UBCH8), and E3-ligase enzymes (shown here as an example is HECT5) are coordinately induced by IFN via ISRE sequences in their respective gene promoter regions. E1, E2 and E3 proteins sequentially catalyse the conjugation of ISG15 to numerous protein substrates to modulate pleiotropic cellular responses to inhibit virus production. This process (ISGylation) is reversibly regulated by proteases (shown here as an example is USP18), which are also induced by IFN. OAS is expressed at low constitutive levels and is induced by type I IFNs. The protein accumulates in the cell cytoplasm as inactive monomers. Upon activation by viral dsRNA the enzyme oligomerizes to (in the instance of OAS1) form a tetramer that synthesizes 2\u2032, 5\u2032oligodenlylates that, in turn, activates the constitutively expressed inactive RNaseL. Binding of 2\u2032, 5\u2032-oligodenlylates to RNaseL triggers dimerization of enzyme monomers, via their kinase-like domains, which then cleaves cellular (and viral) RNAs.\n\nPKR is constitutively expressed, and also induced by type I IFNs via coordinated control from the KCS and ISRE elements in the promoter. The kinase accumulates in both the nucleus and cytoplasm as an inactive monomer. PKR is activated directly by viral RNAs, as well as a number of other ligands, such as cerimide or the protein activator PACT. Upon activation PKR monomers are phosphorylated and dimerize to form the active enzyme. Activated PKR regulates a number of cell signalling pathways via mechanisms which have not been fully explained, but a critical function of PKR is the inhibition of translation via phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1."}
