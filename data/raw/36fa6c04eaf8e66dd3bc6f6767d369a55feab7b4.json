{"title": "A mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission between frontliners and the general public", "body": "The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses a major global health threat. Several control measures are being done to minimize the spread of this contagious disease such as social distancing, case isolation, household quarantine, and school and university closure [Ferguson, et. al 2020] . Following China's containment efforts, several countries adopted broad community quarantines or lockdowns as a means of controlling the spread of COVID-19 [Anderson, 2020 and Cohen and Kupferschmidt 2020] . However, amidst community quarantines and lockdowns, there are working classes who continue to provide essential services for healthcare, medicine, security, food, retail, and transport. This group of workers became collectively referred to as the \"frontliners\". The nature of their work being in close proximity and in frequent interaction with the public puts them at a higher risk of getting infected [Kiersz 2020 and Gamio 2020] , and once infected, their continuous contact with the public can make them superspreaders. This led to the implementation of more stringent precautionary measures for frontliners especially to those working in healthcare.\n\nIn models of the spread of COVID-19, the key parameters are the basic reproduction number which refers to the average number of secondary cases generated from a contagious person, and a dispersion parameter that can provide further information about outbreak dynamics and potential for superspreading events [Riou and Althaus 2020] . It is estimated that the basic reproductive number of COVID-19 is around 1.5 to 4 [Rabajante 2020]. Parameters in models of disease spread are usually considered constant for the entire population with time-variation [Liu, et.al. 2020] . However, these parameters vary considering the heterogeneity of the population, location of virus transmission, and socio-economic and political factors [Rabajante, 2020] .\n\nIn this study, we formulate a mathematical model on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 between the frontliners and the general public. We assume different basic reproductive numbers for the frontliners and the general public. We also consider a parameter for the susceptibility (which can be decreased through some level of protection) of an exposed individual with varying values for the frontliners and the general public. We examine the model simulations and perform sensitivity analysis to determine which parameters are influential to the model output.\n\nWe consider an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) Compartment Model to study the dynamics of the transmission of COVID-19 ( Figure 1) . The model has two mutually exclusive populations: the general public and the frontliners. Frontliners refer to working classes that provide continued services during disease outbreaks such as healthcare workers, customer service and retail personnel, food service crews, and transport or delivery workers.\n\nIn the model, the general public and the frontliners are compartmentalized to Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Recovered. The numbers of susceptible public individuals and frontliners are 1 and 2 , respectively. The numbers of individuals exposed to the disease are 1 for the general public and 2 for the frontliners. For the number of infected, 1 is for the general public and 2 is for the frontliners. From the infected, those that are in isolation are denoted by 1 for the general public and 2 for the frontliners. The numbers of recovered public individuals and frontliners are 1 and 2 , respectively.\n\nThe general public and the frontliners are assigned different parameter values for basic reproduction number and susceptibility depending on the exposure to the disease. We refer to 1 and 2 as exposure rates for the general public and for the frontliners. The exposure rate is the number of new exposed individuals caused by an infectious individual per unit time. The rate at which an exposed public individual and an exposed frontliner become vulnerable or susceptible to the transmission of the virus is given by 1 \u2212 1 and 1 \u2212 2 , respectively. Exposed individuals become infected with the disease at a rate of 1 for the general public and 2 for the frontliners.\n\nMoreover, an infected public individual is being isolated in a health facility at a rate of 1 while an infected frontliner is being isolated at a rate of 2 . The rate of imported cases of infection is 1 for a public individual and 2 for a frontliner. Without isolation, an infected public individual dies at a rate of 1 while an infected frontliner dies at a rate of 2 . However, an infected public individual in isolation dies at a rate 1 while for the frontliner, the rate is given by 2 . Without isolation, the rate of recovery is 1 for an infected public individual and 2 for an infected frontliner. On the other hand, in isolation, a public individual recovers at a rate of 1 * and a frontliner recovers at a rate of 2 * . Individuals who recovered from the disease become susceptible again at a rate of 1 for the general public and 2 for the frontliners.\n\nThe dynamics in the extended SEIR Compartment Model we used in the study is described by the following equations. 1 = \u2212 1 1 1 + 1 1 \u2212 2 2 1 + 1 1 1 = 1 1 1 + 2 2 1 \u2212 1 1 \u2212 1 1 1 = 1 1 \u2212 1 1 \u2212 1 1 \u2212 1 1 + 1 1 = 1 1 \u2212 1 * 1 \u2212 1 1 1 = 1 1 \u2212 1 1 + 1 * 1 2 = \u2212 1 1 2 + 2 2 \u2212 2 2 2 + 2 2 2 = 1 1 2 + 2 2 2 \u2212 2 2 \u2212 2 2 2 = 2 2 \u2212 2 2 \u2212 2 2 \u2212 2 2 + 2 2 = 2 2 \u2212 2 * 2 \u2212 2 2 2 = 2 2 \u2212 2 2 + 2 * 2 1 = 01 \u2022\n\n( 1 (0)+ 1 (0)+ 1 (0)+ 2 (0)+ 2 (0)+ 2 (0)) 1 (0)+ 2 (0) 2 = 02 \u2022\n\n( 1 (0)+ 1 (0)+ 1 (0)+ 2 (0)+ 2 (0)+ 2 (0)) 1 (0)+ 2 (0)\n\nFor the simulation, we use parameter values indicated in Table 1 . We run a simulation of the model for 200 days starting from the onset of the spread of the disease with initial values for population sizes indicated in Table 2 . We vary parameter values for basic reproduction number and susceptibility (vulnerability) rate, and observe the number of infected individuals in isolation and not in isolation for both the frontliners and the general public. The following are our observations.\n\nThe parameters and quantify the protection of the general public and the frontliners when they are exposed to the disease. Higher values for may mean that preventive measures (e.g. social distancing, use of protective gears and self-sanitizing) are effective against infection.\n\nWe vary the values for and and observe how these affect the dynamics of the infection through the general public and the frontliners.\n\nFirst, we increase the protection of the general public, for a fixed value of . We obtained the following insights: (i) as 1 increases, there is a flattening in the peak of the number of infected for both populations , which means increasing the protection of the general All rights reserved.

We observed that peaks are reached after almost the same number of days regardless of the initial population size.\n\nThird, we increase the protection of the frontliners, for a fixed value of . The number of infected frontliners decreased but there is no significant effect on the number of infected public individuals (Fig. 4) . Moreover, when the initial population of frontliners increased ten times, the peak on the number of infected public individuals significantly increased by 43.48% of the total number of susceptible public individuals. When we increase the protection of the frontliners, we observe a decrease in the number of infected public individuals. We also found that decreasing the average secondary infections produced by an infectious public individual ( 01 ) will considerably reduce the infected population of both the general public and the frontliners (Fig.5a) . Figure 5b shows that the most effective way to minimize the number of infected individuals is a combination of reduced reproductive number ( 01 ) and an improved protection for the general public. Moreover, when the average number of secondary cases generated from a contagious public individual and a contagious frontliner is 1.5 and 2.5, respectively (i.e., 01 = 1.5 and 02 = 2.5), there is only a small chance that the general public will infect the frontliners (Fig. 5) , thus protecting the frontliners. This agrees with the measures currently being implemented that the general public should practice social distancing and be protected.\n\nSensitivity analysis is a method used to identify the effect of each parameter in the model outcome. Its aim is to identify the parameters that most influence the model output and quantify how uncertainty in the input affects model outputs [Marino et al., 2008] . In this study, we are interested in the number of infected individuals of both the general public 1 and the frontliners 2 .\n\nWe employed a method called partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) analysis, which is a global sensitivity analysis technique that is proven to be the most reliable and efficient samplingbased method. To implement PRCC analysis, Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) is used in obtaining input parameter values. This is a stratified sampling without replacement technique All rights reserved.

[Marino et al., 2008] . Here, the uniform distribution is assigned to every parameter and simulation is done 10,000 times. The maximum and minimum values of the parameters are set as \u00b190% of the default values listed in Table 1 with values of 1 and 2 set to 0.1.\n\nPRCC values which range from -1 to 1 are computed in different time points, specifically in the years t=40k, k=0,1\u2026,5 using the MATLAB function partialcorr. In Figure 6 , each bar corresponds to a PRCC value at an instance. The value of 1 takes a perfect positive linear relationship while -1 means a perfect negative linear relationship, and a large absolute PRCC value would mean a large correlation of the parameter with the model outcome, that is, a minute change to a sensitive parameter would affect the dynamics of the model output. Parameters 01 , , 1 , 1 , and 02 are found to have high PRCC values (>0.5 or <-0.5). Among these, 01 , 1 , and 02 have positive PRCC values which mean that an increase in the values of these parameters will result in an increase in the infected population size. In contrast, and 1 have negative PRCC values which indicate that increasing their values will consequently decrease the infected population.\n\nWe investigated the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 between frontliners and the general public using an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) Compartment Model. The model has two mutually exclusive populations: the general public and the frontliners.\n\nSince frontliners have frequent interaction with the population, we assume a basic reproduction number higher than that of the general public. Sensitivity of the model parameters is determined to evaluate those with significant impact on the model output, in this case, the infected population of both the general public and frontliners. It was observed that the infected population is sensitive to the changes in the basic reproduction numbers of the general public 01 and of the frontliners 02 , the infection period , the infection rate of an exposed public individual 1 , and the recovery rate of a non-isolated infected public individual 1 .\n\nThe model cannot be immediately utilized to make predictions on the spread of COVID-19 but it provides us insights on the transmission of a disease between two populations with different characteristics in terms of factors affecting the spread of a disease, such as the basic reproduction number and susceptibility rate. This can help in developing sound decisions and All rights reserved.

Simulations of the model show that both the frontliners and the general public should be protected or resilient against a spreading disease.\n\nPrioritizing only the protection of the frontliners cannot flatten the epidemic curve. On the other hand, protecting only the general public from the disease will significantly flatten the epidemic curve but the infection risk faced by the frontliners is still high, which can eventually affect their capability to provide services during an epidemic. In addition, if the control measures for the public are less strict, we can expect that the number of secondary cases to be higher on the average. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10. 1101 author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.27.20045195 doi: medRxiv preprint 1 = 2 = 0.03/14, 1 = 2 = 0.02/14, 1 = 2 = 0.1.
