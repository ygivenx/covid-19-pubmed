{"title": "Long-term immunogenicity of an AS03-adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine in young and elderly adults: An observer-blind, randomized trial \u0b1d\u0b1d", "body": "Mass immunization is considered to be an effective prophylactic method of mitigating influenza pandemic-associated morbidity and mortality [1] [2] [3] [4] . Due to the novel antigenic characteristics of the swine-origin influenza A(H1N1) 2009 pandemic virus [influenza (A(H1N1)pdm09] [5, 6] , the seasonal influenza vaccines available at the time of the 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic were unlikely to confer protection against the novel virus [5, 7, 8] .\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) encouraged the development and use of adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccines [9, 10] , with the aim of dose-reduction, antigen-sparing and to potentially provide broader vaccine efficacy against drifted strains through cross-reactive immunity [11] . Based on the experience of developing a pre-pandemic A/H5N1 influenza vaccine utilizing AS03 (an \u2423-tocopherol oil-in-water emulsion based Adjuvant System) [12, 13] that was well-tolerated and highly immunogenic in adults [14] [15] [16] , an AS03-adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine with 3.75 g hemagglutinin (HA) content was developed [17] [18] [19] .\n\nThis large-scale, randomized study in subjects \u226518 years of age assessed whether one dose of AS03-adjuvanted 3.75 g HA influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine elicited immune response that met the US and European regulatory criteria. Additionally, noninferiority and superiority of this vaccine protective efficacy versus a non-adjuvanted 15 g HA influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine were evaluated.\n\nIn this phase III, observer-blind, randomized study (NCT00979602), adults \u226518 years of age were enrolled across 25 centers in the US and 13 in Canada between November 2009 and December 11, 2009 . They were randomized (allocation ratio 1:1) to receive one dose of either a monovalent AS03-adjuvanted 3.75 g HA A/California/7/2009 pandemic influenza vaccine or a non-adjuvanted 15 g HA A/California/7/2009 pandemic influenza vaccine. The enrolment stratification was by age (1:1:1:1; 18-30 years, 31-40 years, 41-64 years, \u226565 years). The subjects and study personnel involved in evaluating end points were blinded to the intervention administered. Double blinding was not possible because the vaccine preparation required mixing of AS03 and A(H1N1)pdm09 antigen from two vials. Randomization was performed using a central, internet-based system that balanced groups with respect to center, age strata and previous seasonal influenza vaccination.\n\nAdults were excluded from enrolment: if they had a history of physician-confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza infection or vaccination, those who received any vaccination other than a seasonal influenza vaccine within 30 days preceding study start, those with confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient conditions, diagnosed with or undergoing treatment for cancer, and/or with a history of allergic/anaphylactic reactions following previous influenza vaccination. In addition, laboratory screening was performed to exclude those with results outside of protocol-specified normal ranges. The following safety laboratory parameters were tested to evaluate the participants' eligibility: hepatic aminotransferases, total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, serum urea nitrogen, hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell count and platelet count.\n\nActive surveillance of influenza-like infections (ILIs: defined as fever \u226538.0 \u2022 C/100.4 \u2022 F or new or worsening myalgia accompanied by new or worsening cough or sore throat) was done during study visits and through bi-weekly telephonic contact through Day 385 (12 months after the initially planned administration of the second study vaccine dose). Additionally, the subjects were instructed to contact the study sites if they develop any ILI symptoms. Once the study site had been notified of a possible ILI episode, a visit for nasal and throat swab sample collection was scheduled within 5 days of symptom onset and before initiating any antimicrobial/influenza antiviral therapy. If an ILI episode was reported more than 5 days after onset, no swab specimen was collected.\n\nWritten informed consent was obtained from all subjects prior to conducting any study-related procedures. The study was conducted in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice guidelines, the Declaration of Helsinki and local regulations. All study-related documents were approved by institutional review boards.\n\nThe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine was a monovalent, inactivated, split-virion antigen suspension (A/California/07/2009 strain) adjuvanted with AS03 (Arepanrix TM , a trademark of GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines) or administered as plain antigen. The H1N1 viral seed for the vaccine was prepared as per WHO recommendations [20] . AS03 is an oil-in-water emulsion based Adjuvant System containing squalene (10.69 mg per dose), DL-\u2423-tocopherol (11.86 mg) and polysorbate 80 (4.86 mg). The AS03-adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine doses were prepared by mixing the A(H1N1)pdm09 antigen and AS03 (1:1) from separate multidose vials. 0.5 ml of the assigned study vaccine was administered into the deltoid muscle within 30 min after mixing the antigen and the adjuvant.\n\nThe first co-primary objective of the study was to evaluate HI antibody responses 21 days after vaccination in the AS03adjuvanted vaccine group based on the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) and Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) criteria for pandemic influenza vaccines in adults [21, 22] .\n\nAt least 360 RT-qPCR-confirmed A/California influenza cases were required to evaluate the second co-primary objective on noninferior protective efficacy followed by superiority. As only three RT-qPCR-confirmed A/California influenza cases were diagnosed during the study, descriptive analyses of the influenza attack rate and vaccine efficacy improvement (VEI) were computed only for ILI and pneumonia cases.\n\nThe study also assessed whether the non-adjuvanted 15 g HA influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine elicited immune responses that met the US and European regulatory criteria, 21 days after vaccination and whether these criteria were met for either study vaccines at Day 42 (in a small subset of subjects) and at Day 182 (Month 6).\n\nHemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody levels in serum samples were assessed at GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines central laboratory using a validated in-house assay [cut-off: \u22651:10] that used chicken erythrocytes, as previously described [23] . The A/California/7/2009 strain was used as the antigen strain.\n\nRT-qPCR was performed on viral RNA from the clinical samples as described previously [24] . Viral load values were quantified and the sample was considered positive when the measured viral load was equal to or above the assay cut-off [24] .\n\nSerum samples were collected before vaccination (Day 0), at Days 21, 42 (in a subset of subjects) and 182 (Month 6) for assessment of humoral immune response and for clinical chemistry and hematology assessments at Days 0, 7 and 21.\n\nThe immunological assessment was based on HI antibody seroconversion rates (SCR), seroprotection rate (SPR) and geometric mean fold rise (GMFR), against the vaccine homologous strain.\n\nPost hoc exploratory analyses included the assessment of possible correlation of HI antibody response with body mass index (BMI) and with previous influenza vaccination history. Further assessments were performed to identify the respiratory viruses isolated from swab samples from ILI cases using xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) Fast assay (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics Inc., Toronto, Canada) [25, 26] .\n\nSubjects used diary cards to record the solicited local and general symptoms occurring within 7 days following vaccination and the unsolicited adverse events occurring within 42 days following vaccination. Potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs: subset of AEs that include both autoimmune diseases and other inflammatory and/or neurologic disorders which may/may not have an autoimmune etiology) and serious adverse events (SAEs) were recorded throughout the study period. The intensity of all solicited adverse events except fever was graded on a scale of (0-3), Grade 1 being those that did not interfere with normal activities and Grade 3 being those that prevented normal activities (Grade 3 redness and swelling: diameter >100 mm; Grade 3 fever: temperatures \u226539.0-\u226440.0 \u2022 C. Fever was graded on a scale of (0-4), Grade 4 being temperatures >40.0 \u2022 C. Based on clinical judgment, the investigators assessed whether the AEs/SAEs were potentially related/not related to the study vaccine.\n\nSerum samples for the analysis of clinical safety laboratory parameters were collected at Days 7 and 21. The following laboratory parameters were tested: hepatic aminotransferases, total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, serum urea nitrogen, hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell count and platelet count.\n\nThe sample size was calculated taking into consideration the co-primary objectives. Overall, 1900 evaluable subjects (1800 for VEI evaluation) in each of the two treatment groups (accounting for 5% and 10% drop-out rates for the co-primary objectives) was estimated to provide a power of 91.85% to meet the co-primary objectives, assuming 90%/74% as reference for SPR/SCR in subjects 18-64 years and >64 years of age, respectively, 40% vaccine efficacy for the non-adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine, and an attack rate of 20% in subjects who do not receive any H1N1 vaccine (PASS 2005; one-sided test, one-sided alpha = 2.5%).\n\nThe SCR, SPR and GMFR and incidence rates of solicited and unsolicited adverse events were calculated with 95% confidence interval (CI). The analyses of immunogenicity were performed on the according to protocol (ATP) cohort which included evaluable subjects meeting eligibility criteria and adhering to protocoldefined procedures. A Cox regression model, including the vaccine group as a fixed effect, age and baseline antibody titer as covariates was used to estimate the VEI for the any ILI cases and any pneumonia cases (the first event was considered if multiple events were reported by a subject). All statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) version 9.1.\n\nA total of 5660 subjects were screened, 4048 received vaccine, and 3770 completed the study through Day 385. The reasons for withdrawals and elimination of subjects from the analyses at different time points are presented in Fig. 1 .\n\nThe mean age of subjects in the TVC at the time of vaccination in the 18-64 years age group was 37.4 years (range: 18-64 years); >64 years age group was 71.2 years (range: 65-92 years). Overall, 59.2% and 56.3% of subjects in the respective two age groups were female and the majority of subjects were Caucasians (86.9% and 93.0%, respectively).\n\nCo-primary objectives: The first co-primary objective was met. A single dose of the AS03-adjuvanted 3.75 g HA influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine elicited HI immune responses in the 18-64 years and >64 years age groups that met the CBER regulatory criteria at Day 21 ( Table 1 ). The CHMP criteria were met in the 18-60 years and >60 years age groups (data not presented).\n\nThe second co-primary objective was not evaluated as only three RT-qPCR-confirmed A/California influenza cases were identified (AS03-adjuvanted: 1; non-adjuvanted: 2).\n\nSecondary objectives: In the Day 42 subset (N = 192) which received the AS03-adjuvanted 3.75 g HA influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine, the CBER criteria were met in the 18-64 years age group and >64 years age group (Table 1) . At Day 182 (Month 6), the CBER criteria were met only for subjects 18-64 years of age (Table 1 ). Subjects >64 years of age had a LL of the 95% CI for SPR of 47.7%, thus not fulfilling the CBER criteria at this time point.\n\nAt Day 21, a single dose of the non-adjuvanted 15 g HA influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine elicited HI immune responses in subjects 18-64 years and >64 years of age that met the CBER regulatory criteria (Table 1) . Only those in the 18-64 years age group met the CBER criteria at Day 42 and at Day 182 (Month 6). At this time points subjects >64 years of age had a LLs of the 95% CI for SPR of 43.2 and 38.6%, respectively and LLs of the 95% CI for SCR of 27.0% and 22.6%, respectively, thus not fulfilling the CBER criteria.\n\nThe CHMP criteria were met at Day 21 and Day 42 in the 18-60 years and >60 years age groups for both study vaccines. At Day 182, the CHMP criteria were met in the 18-60 years age group but not in the >60 years age group for both study vaccines (data not presented).\n\nHI antibody GMTs in both age groups were higher at all post-vaccination time points for those who received the AS03adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine compared to those who received the non-adjuvanted vaccine; GMTs were generally lower in the >64 years compared to the 18-64 years age group at all time points (Table 1) . Persistence of HI antibody response at Day 182 (Month 6) was observed for both study vaccines, although at lower levels compared to that observed at Day 21 (Table 1) . Overall, the immune response against the vaccine homologous strain appeared to decrease with advancing age (Fig. 2 /Web-appendix Table 1 ).\n\nPost hoc exploratory analyses showed that HI antibody responses were mostly comparable across healthy weight, overweight and obese subjects. No clear patterns emerged due to the modest number of subjects in the underweight category (Web-appendix Table 2 ). A higher HI antibody was observed among influenza vaccine-na\u00efve subjects, compared with those with previous seasonal influenza vaccination, in terms of HI antibody GMTs and GMFRs (Web-appendix Table 2 ). [11.95%] in the AS03-adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted treatment groups) were reported and 337 were sampled during the study. Of these, 290 samples were tested and only three cases (0.7%) of A(H1N1)pdm09 were confirmed by RT-qPCR (one and two cases respectively). The incidence of ILI cases was comparable between the two treatment groups, except through Day 28 ( Respiratory viruses: Rhinovirus, identified from 74 (25.5%) nasopharyngeal swabs, was the most frequently determined respiratory virus (Table 3 ).\n\nSolicited adverse events: Pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported solicited local adverse event. It was reported for 82.1% and 29.9% of subjects in the 18-64 years age group who received the AS03-adjuvanted and the non-adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine, respectively (p < 0.0001) and for 56.7% and 9.4% of subjects in the >64 years group who received the adjuvanted and the non-adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine, respectively (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 3 /Web-appendix Table 3 ). Additionally, in both age groups, a statistically significant higher percentage of subjects receiving the adjuvanted vaccine reported redness and swelling compared with non-adjuvanted vaccine group (p < 0.05 for both). Muscle ache (AS03-adjuvanted/nonadjuvanted: 18-64 years: 39.2%/18.4%, p < 0.0001; >64 years: 19.4%/7.3%, p < 0.0001), fatigue (AS03-adjuvanted/non-adjuvanted: 18-64 years: 30.9%/23.6%, p < 0.0001; >64 years: 17.5%/12.3%, p = 0.03) and headache (AS03-adjuvanted/non-adjuvanted: 18-64 years: 29.6%/27.5%, p = 0.21; >64 years: 15.2%/11.5%, p = 0.11) were the most frequently reported solicited general adverse events (Fig. 3 /Web-appendix Table 3 ). In the 18-64 years age group, a higher percentage on subjects receiving the adjuvanted vaccine reported joint pain, shivering and sweating compared with nonadjuvanted group (p < 0.05 for all). In the >64 years group joint pain was reported by a higher percentage of subjects receiving adjuvanted vaccine compared with the subjects receiving the nonadjuvanted vaccine (p = 0.005). In this age group, no statistically significant differences were observed between vaccine groups in terms of shivering, sweating and fever (p > 0.05). Solicited local and general adverse events of Grade 3 intensity were reported for \u22643.6% of subjects. In the 18-64 years age group, the incidence of pain at the injection site, joint pain and muscle aches of Grade 3 intensity was significantly higher in the adjuvanted vaccine group compared with the non-adjuvanted group (p < 0.0001 for pain at the injection site; p = 0.03 for joint pain; p = 0.006 for muscle aches). The incidence of other solicited symptoms of Grade 3 intensity in this age group, as well as in the >64 years age group, was not statistically significant different between the adjuvanted and the non-adjuvanted vaccine groups (p > 0.05). Reporting of solicited adverse events was higher in the 18-64 years age group.\n\nUnsolicited adverse events: A total of 181 subjects (4.5%; AS03-adjuvanted: 18 Table 4 ); 84 subjects in the AS03-adjuvanted treatment group, 18-64 years: 2.9%, >64 years: 8.1%, and 73 subjects in the non-adjuvanted treatment group, 18-64 years: 2.1%, >64 years: 8.5%. Two of these events, intestinal obstruction (AS03-adjuvanted treatment group) and multiple sclerosis (non-adjuvanted treatment group) were considered by the investigator to be possibly related to study vaccine and were also considered pIMDs. Through Day 385 (Month 12), 12 pIMDs according to the predefined list of pIMD preferred terms were reported, with 5 and 7 in AS03-adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted influenza treatment groups, respectively. Seven fatal SAEs were reported, 6 and 1 in AS03-adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted treatment groups, respectively. All were assessed by investigators as not related to vaccination. A detailed description of all fatal SAEs is provided in Web appendix Table 5 . Overall, 32 samples had laboratory values for the hematological and biochemical parameters outside the normal laboratory reference range at Days 7 and 21. Of these, 14 were from subjects in the adjuvanted vaccine group and 18 were from subjects in the non-adjuvanted vaccine group.\n\nData from this large, controlled study in adults 18 years of age and older demonstrated that a single dose of AS03-adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine elicited strong HI immune responses 21 days later that met the CHMP and the more stringent CBER criteria for pandemic influenza vaccines. The HI antibody response persisted through six months after vaccination for both vaccines, although the CBER criteria were met only in the 18-64 years age group and CHMP criteria in the 18-60 years age group.\n\nThe co-primary objective concerning relative vaccine efficacy against influenza was not evaluated due to the small number of RT-qPCR-confirmed H1N1/09 influenza cases. The low number of cases observed may be partially due to the timing of the study; the start of study vaccination followed the peak of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus transmission in the US and Canada by a week or more (last week of October, 2009), by which time A(H1N1)pdm09 circulation had diminished considerably. Published estimates of AS03-adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine effectiveness against influenza range from 62.0% to 100.0% [27] [28] [29] [30] .\n\nOverall, the incidence of ILI cases was comparable between the two groups, except in the first 28 days after vaccination (20 versus 41 ILI cases in the AS03-adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted treatment groups, respectively). This study was not sufficiently powered to detect statistical significance in this analysis.\n\nThe data for elderly subjects from the present study are in agreement with observations made in previous studies that one dose of the AS03-adjuvanted 3.75 g HA influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine may be insufficient to meet CBER criteria at 6 months in elderly [31] and two doses of vaccine administered 21 days apart induce longterm persistence of HI antibodies at putatively protective levels [32] [33] [34] . Nicholson et al. demonstrated that two doses of a different AS03-adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine elicited HI immune responses that persisted at seroprotective levels in >70% of subjects \u226565 years of age, up to six months after vaccination, although at lower levels compared to younger adults (p < 0.0001) [34] .\n\nSimilar to other observations [11, 17, 18, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] , our results showed that previous seasonal vaccination appeared to negatively influence the strength of the immune response elicited by the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccines, especially in terms of longterm immunogenicity. There are conflicting reports on whether previous seasonal influenza vaccination increases the risk of subsequently contracting A(H1N1)pdm09 infection requiring medical attention [30, 41] . The effect of BMI on immune response was also studied. Consistent with previous trials [42, 43] , in the present study, high BMI did not appear to impair HI antibody response shortly after vaccination. However, Sheridan et al. reported a decrease in HI antibody titers in obese subjects 12 months after vaccination [43] , an observation also made in the present study.\n\nThe reactogenicity and safety profile was in agreement with available data in adults and children [19, 32, 44] . The frequency of solicited local adverse events in this study was higher in the AS03-adjuvanted versus the non-adjuvanted treatment group and the frequency of solicited adverse events were comparatively lower in the >64 years age group. Previous clinical trials of influenza A(H1N1/)pdm09 vaccines [17, 45, 2, 46] comparing safety outcomes between adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccines reported similar observations, with higher frequency of both local and general adverse events with adjuvanted vaccines compared with non-adjuvanted vaccines. In our study, we did not observe any differences between the two vaccine groups in terms of SAEs considered as possibly related to vaccination (1 in each group). Although an imbalance in the number of fatal SAEs was observed between the adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted group (6 versus 1), none were considered to be related to vaccination and they all occurred in subjects with a relevant medical history.\n\nA gradual decrement in the HI antibody GMTs elicited by both study vaccines against the A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine strain in older subjects was observed and this could be attributed to \"immunosenescence\" [47, 48] . A decreasing trend with advancing age was also observed in the frequency of solicited adverse events.\n\nA possible limitation of this study was the absence of blood samples collection for assessment of the immune response after Day 182 (Month 6). This period of six months was anticipated to cover the period of transmission of influenza virus during one season. A recently published study enrolling 240 subjects randomized to receive one or two doses of the same adjuvanted vaccine and followed up to 12 months, showed that regulatory criteria were met 6 months after the administration of the last vaccine dose in subjects aged 18-60 years receiving either one or two vaccine doses and in subjects aged >60 years receiving two vaccine doses [49] . At Day 385 (Month 12) the regulatory criteria were still met only in subjects aged 18-60 years who received two vaccine doses.\n\nIn conclusion, a single dose of either adjuvanted or nonadjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccines elicited protective levels of HI antibodies against the vaccine homologous A/California/7/2009 strain that persisted up to Day 182 (Month 6) in the 18-64 years population. Adjuvantation potentially offers the opportunity for antigen-sparing, making this AS03-adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine a candidate to help meet the demands for the large number of vaccine doses required to mitigate pandemic influenza.
