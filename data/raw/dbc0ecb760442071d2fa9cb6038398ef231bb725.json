{"title": "Role of IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness in CD8 T cell-mediated viral clearance and demyelination in coronavirus-infected mice", "body": "Infection of the central nervous system (CNS) with viruses and other pathogens changes the normally quiescent CNS microenvironment to a pro-inflammatory state Griffin, 2003; Hickey, 2001) . After the initial innate response to a viral infection, effector CD8 T cells traffic to the inflamed CNS, playing a critical role in viral clearance through lytic and non-lytic antiviral mechanisms. However, these mechanisms are tightly regulated in the CNS during infection as well as in the resting state to prevent unnecessary autoimmune destruction of this vital, nonregenerative tissue. Furthermore, mechanisms that protect the CNS from immune-mediated damage may ultimately lead to incomplete viral clearance, persistent CNS infection, and chronic disease. Therefore, the generation of appropriate immune res-ponses to infection results in clearance of virus while protecting the function of host tissues.\n\nThe neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus, strain JHM (MHV-JHM) is a well-studied pathogen that upsets the balance between viral clearance and regulation of host immune responses in the CNS Perlman and Dandekar, 2005; Stohlman et al., 1998; Templeton and Perlman, 2007) . MHV-JHM is a member of the family coronaviridae, which includes pathogens that are responsible for an array of human diseases ranging in pathogenicity from the relatively innocuous common cold to the more damaging severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Immunocompetent mice infected with an attenuated MHV-JHM variant, J2.2v-1, also develop demyelinating disease (Fleming et al., 1987; Stohlman et al., 1998) . Demyelination, a hallmark of the human disease multiple sclerosis (MS), is characterized by dense infiltration of macrophages into areas of white matter of the CNS, in some instances appearing in direct contact with myelin-stripped axons in MS lesions (Trapp et al., 1998) and in the spinal cord of MHV-JHM-infected mice (Templeton et al., in press ). It has been hypothesized that, in addition to genetic factors which increase susceptibility, environmental factors such as chronic viral infection may play an important role in the etiology of MS (Hemmer et al., 2002) . Studies that examine the pathogenesis of an autoimmune model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), have largely focused on CD4 T cells as mediators of demyelinating disease. However, increasing evidence suggests that CD8 T cells also play an important role in autoimmune myelin destruction (Brisebois et al., 2006; Huseby et al., 2001) . Therefore, CD8 T cells are implicated in both viral clearance and autoimmune destruction of myelin in the CNS.\n\nWhen immunodeficient RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 , SCID, or irradiated mice (that lack adaptive immunity) are infected with J2.2v-1, no demyelination develops and mice succumb to severe encephalitis characterized by high levels of infectious virus in the CNS (Wang et al., 1990; Wu and Perlman, 1999) . However, transfer of splenocytes from MHV-JHM-immunized B6 mice infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice reconstitutes demyelination (Wu et al., 2000) . In this model, development of demyelination is T cell-mediated, as depletion of both populations from the donor splenocyte suspension abrogates disease. Removal of either CD4 or CD8 Tcells from the donor population does not abrogate demyelination, although recipient RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit distinct clinical courses. Mice receiving CD4 T cells (CD8 depleted) develop more severe encephalitis with little demyelination around 6-7 days post-transfer. After receiving CD8 T cell-enriched (CD4 T cell-depleted) splenocytes, infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice develop extensive demyelination, and display only a mild encephalitis when compared to mice receiving CD4 T cell-enriched splenocytes. CD4 and CD8 T cells mediate demyelination by different mechanisms. When CD8 T cell-enriched splenocytes are isolated from an MHV-JHMimmunized IFN-\u03b3 \u2212/\u2212 donor, demyelination is significantly reduced when compared to mice receiving wild type CD8 T cellenriched splenocytes . Transfer of IFN-\u03b3 \u2212/\u2212 CD4 T cell-enriched splenocytes into infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice results in increased demyelination .\n\nIFN-\u03b3 is a pleiotropic antiviral cytokine that is critical for CD8 T cell-mediated clearance of MHV-JHM from oligodendrocytes (Parra et al., 1999) . In addition to activation of antiviral genes in infected and adjacent uninfected CNS cells, IFN-\u03b3 induces MHC expression and the production of chemokines such as the macrophage chemoattractant CCL2 (MCP-1) (Tran et al., 2000) . After recruitment of macrophages by CCL2 and other cytokines/ chemokines, IFN-\u03b3 acts to increase both production of nitric oxide and phagocytic function, (Schroder et al., 2004) which increases the demyelinating potential of these cells. In further support of the connection between IFN-\u03b3-production and demyelination, Huseby et al. (2001) demonstrated that antibody blockade of IFN-\u03b3 in a CD8 T cell-mediated EAE resulted in decreased disease. A recent study of a spontaneous model of CD8 T cellmediated demyelination using mice that constitutively express the T cell costimulatory molecule CD86 in microglia also supports this connection, as IFN-\u03b3R \u2212/\u2212 mice did not develop disease (Brisebois et al., 2006) . Collectively, these results show that IFN-\u03b3 is a central component in both CD8 T cell-mediated viral clearance and demyelination. Previous studies have focused on the requirement for IFN-\u03b3, but not on the target of IFN-\u03b3. Herein, we use MHV-JHM-infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice sufficient or deficient in IFN-\u03b3 receptor expression, to determine the target cell for IFN-\u03b3 expressed by CD8 T cells. Unexpectedly, our results showed that enhanced virus replication with subsequent demyelination occurred in the absence of IFN-\u03b3R expression in recipient mice.\n\nThe neuroattenuated variant of MHV-JHM, J2.2v-1, provided by Dr. J. Fleming (University of Wisconsin, Madison), was used in all studies. Infectious virus isolated from brains was titered by dilution of the homogenates on Hela cells which express the receptor for MHV-JHM (Hela-MHVR).\n\nPathogen-free 5-6 week old C57Bl/6 (B6) mice were purchased from the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD). Mice deficient in the recombinase activating gene 1 (RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 ) or in the \u03b1-chain of the IFN-\u03b3 receptor complex (IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 ) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and bred at the University of Iowa, as were mice transgenic for production of enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) under control of the \u03b2actin promoter. Single knockout mice were crossed to obtain mice deficient in both IFN-\u03b3R1 and RAG1. Mice were screened for IFN-\u03b3R1 and RAG1 deficiency by PCR screening as previously described (Huang et al., 1993; Mombaerts et al., 1992; . All animal studies were approved by the University of Iowa Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nRAG1 \u2212/\u2212 or IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice were infected with 1 \u00d7 10 3 PFU 2.2v-1 by intracranial injection. Adoptive transfer of 5 \u00d7 10 6 splenocytes from B6, GFP+, or IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 mice immunized i.p. with wild type MHV-JHM to infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 or IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice was performed as previously described (Wu and Perlman, 1999) .\n\nThe following mAbs were used in flow cytometric analysis or immunofluorescence microscopy (all purchased from BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, unless stated): unconjugated and biotinylated rat anti-F4/80 (cl BM-8 Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA); biotinylated rat anti-CD11c (mAb HL3); PEconjugated rat anti-IFN-\u03b3 (mAb XMG1.2); FITC-conjugated and biotinylated rat anti-CD8 (mAb 53-6.7); purified rat anti-Fc\u03b3RIII/II Ab (mAb 2.4G2); unconjugated anti-MHV nucleocapsid protein (51B88.2. Provided by Dr. M. Buchmeier, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA).\n\nEight micrometer sections were prepared from 4% p-formaldehyde-fixed, snap frozen spinal cords. Sections were blocked with 10% horse serum in PBS, prior to incubation with primary antibody that detected macrophages/microglia (biotinylated rat anti-F4/80 (cl BM-8), 1:200), dendritic cells (biotinylated hamster anti-mouse CD11c (HL3), 1:200), T cells (biotinylated antirat CD4 and biotinylated anti-rat CD8 (BD Biosciences) for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing, sections were incubated with streptavidin (SA)-HRP (1:1000, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for an additional hour. Sections were amplified using TSA-Cy3 (Tyramide Signal Amplification, 1:100; Perkin-Elmer, Boston, MA) for 5 min. Samples were photographed with a Leitz DMRB microscope with a fluorescence attachment.\n\nMouse spinal cords were prepared and stained for demyelination, macrophage infiltration, and viral infection as previously described (Xue et al., 1999) . For examination of myelin integrity, 8 \u03bcm sections were stained with luxol fast blue and counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin. The amount of demyelination was quantified as previously described, using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD). For immunohistochemistry, rehydrated spinal cord sections were incubated with anti-rat F4/80 (1:500) to identify macrophages or mouse anti-MHV nucleocapsid protein (1:10,000) overnight, followed by isotype specific biotinylated antibody, followed by streptavidin-HRP. HRP was visualized using the Sigma FAST 3,3-Diaminobenzidine visualization kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).\n\nBlood was collected in 1 ml of ACK lysis buffer and leukocytes counted after red blood cells lysis. CNS-derived leukocytes were isolated from B6 mice with acute encephalitis or subacute/ chronic encephalomyelitis as previously described (Castro et al., 1994) . Briefly, animals were sacrificed and perfused with sterile 1\u00d7 PBS. Brain tissues were mechanically homogenized using frosted glass slides. Cells were suspended in 30% Percoll (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) and centrifuged at 800 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. Percoll and lipid layers were aspirated and the cell pellet was washed twice and counted. Leukocytes in the CNS were identified by expression of CD45 using flow cytometry. Flow cytometry was performed on FACScan Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences, Mountain View, CA).\n\nCNS-isolated cells were incubated in the presence of D bbinding S510 peptide or control peptide for 4 hours at 37\u00b0C in the presence of Golgiplug (brefeldin A, BD Biosciences). After incubation, cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-CD8 mAb incubated in buffer containing 10% rat serum and anti-Fc\u03b3RIII/II mAb. For detection of intracellular IFN-\u03b3, cells were washed, fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with PE-conjugated anti-IFN-\u03b3 mAb as previously described (Wu et al., 2000) . For phenotypic analysis, cells derived from the CNS were blocked and then incubated with specific mAbs, followed by flow cytometric analysis.\n\nA two-tailed unpaired Student t test was used to analyze differences in mean values between groups. All results are expressed as means \u00b1 SEM. Values of p b 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\n3.1. Donor T cells, but not macrophages and DCs, traffic to the spinal cord in infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 recipient mice J2.2v-1-infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice that receive splenocytes from MHV-JHM immune B6 mice develop demyelination, while demyelination is absent in infected mice that receive splenocytes depleted of CD4 and CD8 T cells (Wu et al., 2000) . Thus, T cells are necessary for induction of demyelination in J2.2v-1-infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice. However, since demyelination is characterized by dense infiltration of F4/80 + and CD11c + macrophages/microglia and DCs, it is possible that transferred phagocytic cells play a role in myelin destruction. Therefore, in the absence of an activating factor such as IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness in recipient mice, donor IFN-\u03b3R + phagocytic cells may be able to compensate in the presence of T cells to mediate demyelinating disease. To rule out the presence of donor F4/80 + and CD11c + macrophages as a contributing factor in the diseased spinal cord of chronically infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, we transferred donor splenocytes from MHV-JHM immune mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Fig. 1) . At 8 days post-transfer, the spinal cords of infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited infiltration of GFP + cells, many of which were positive for the T cell markers CD4 and CD8 (Fig. 1A,  B) . However, F4/80 + macrophages were uniformly GFP \u2212 (Fig. 1C, D) . Furthermore, CD11c + cells were also GFP \u2212 , and were clustered in the spinal cord near GFP + cells (Fig. 1E, G) or appeared in a circular, perivascular arrangement (Fig. 1) . Therefore, F4/80 + and CD11c + cells in the MHV-J2.2v-1infected spinal cord were not donor-derived. \n\nPrevious results demonstrated that IFN-\u03b3 expression by donor CD8 T cells was critical for demyelination in J2.2v-1-infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice . Although macrophages in these spinal cords are recipient-derived (Fig. 1) , macrophage and microglia activation may be a consequence of autocrine activation of CD8 T cells by IFN-\u03b3. We examined this possibility by transferring IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 CD8 T cell-enriched (CD4 depleted) splenocytes into J2.2v-1-infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, and analyzed the amount of demyelination and virus levels in the CNS. Our results showed no significant increase in demyelination in infected recipients of IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 compared to wild type CD8 T cell-enriched splenocytes ( Fig. 2A, C, F ). In addition, the recruitment of macrophages to areas of demyelination was equivalent in both groups (Fig. 2D, G) , and the ability of recipient mice to clear virus from the CNS was not significantly altered (Fig. 2B, E, H) . Thus, donor IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness does not significantly contribute to CD8 T cell-mediated demyelination or viral clearance.\n\nIn order to determine the requirement for IFN-\u03b3R1 in recipient cells, including macrophages and microglia, we adoptively transferred MHV-JHM-immune B6 CD8 T cell-enriched splenocytes into infected mice deficient in both IFN-\u03b3R1 and RAG1 (IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 ) or into control IFN-\u03b3R1 +/+ RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice. As expected, demyelination was decreased in recipient mice that lacked IFN-\u03b3R1 when compared to IFN-\u03b3R1 sufficient mice Fig. 3 . IFN-\u03b3 recipient responsiveness contributes to CD8 T cell-mediated viral clearance and demyelination with wild type donor cells. Infected IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice receiving CD8-enriched splenocytes i.v. from MHV-JHM-immune B6 mice were sacrificed on days 8-10 post-transfer, and spinal cord sections were stained for demyelination with luxol fast blue (C and F). Immunohistochemical analysis of adjacent sections detected macrophage infiltration (E and H) and viral antigen (F and I), as described in Fig. 2 . Demyelination was slightly decreased in IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 recipient mice (white bar, A, and G) compared to IFN-\u03b3R1 +/+ RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 recipients (black bar, A, and D), although this difference was not statistically significant (p N 0.05). The amount of infectious virus in brain homogenates (p = 0.0013) and distribution of virus antigen near areas of demyelination was increased (IFN-\u03b3R1 +/+ , squares, B, tissue section, F. IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 , triangles, B, tissue section I). Virus was detected in 5/5 IFN-\u03b3R1 +/+ and 8/8 IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 recipient mice. Macrophage infiltration was generally localized to areas of demyelination in both groups (IFN-\u03b3R1 +/+ , E. IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 , H). When the ratio of demyelination to viral titer was compared for each sample, the differences between recipients were significant (IFN-\u03b3R1 +/+ black bar, IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 white bar, C, p = 0.0126). Data are presented as a summary of two experiments. (Fig. 3A , D, G) while macrophage infiltration remained associated with areas of demyelination in both groups (Fig. 3E, H) . Furthermore, viral titers were higher in recipient mice lacking IFN-\u03b3R1, up to one and a half log pfu/ml higher when compared to infected IFN-\u03b3 responsive RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 3B, F, I) . Viral titers in the CNS of RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice that received IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 CD8 T cells were comparable to previously published CNS titers of infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice that did not receive splenocytes (Wu and Perlman, 1999) .\n\nIn previous reports of J2.2v-1 infection, viral clearance was determined to be IFN-\u03b3 or IFN-\u03b3R dependent (Gonzalez et al., 2006; Parra et al., 1999) . Our observation of increased viral titers in infected IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 recipients support this conclusion (Fig. 3B, F, I) . Therefore, an increase in virulence may also increase demyelination in the absence of IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness. When demyelination and viral titer are calculated as a ratio (demyelination:viral titer) for individual mice, the difference between IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 recipients and IFN-\u03b3R1 +/+ recipients is increased (Fig. 3C ). These differences reflect the combination of increased demyelination with lower virus loads in RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 recipients compared to decreased demyelination and higher virus loads in IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 recipients.\n\nThere is a five-fold decrease in demyelination when CD8 T8 T cell-enriched splenocytes from IFN-\u03b3 \u2212/\u2212 as opposed to B6 donors were transferred into J2.2v-1-infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 recipients . In IFN-\u03b3R1 deficient recipients, however, the decrease in CD8 T cell-mediated demyelination was diminished. Although donor macrophages and DCs do not traffic to the spinal cord in MHV-J2.2v-1infected mice (Fig. 1) , IFN-\u03b3R1 + donor cells present in the transferred population may compensate for the lack of IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness of recipient mice, thus increasing demyelination. To eliminate this potentially complicating factor, we transferred IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 donor CD8 T cell-enriched splenocytes into J2.2v-1-infected IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice or RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Similar to mice receiving wild type splenocytes, infected IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice receiving IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 CD8 T cellenriched splenocytes exhibited decreased demyelination and increased virus titers when compared to RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 recipients (Fig. 4A, B) . Furthermore, when the ratio of demyelination to Fig. 2 and depicted in Figs. 2 and 3) . Demyelination was decreased in IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 recipient mice (white bar, A) compared to IFN-\u03b3R1 +/+ RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 recipients (black bar, A), although the difference between recipients was not statistically significant (p N 0.05). The amount of infectious virus in brain homogenates (p b 0.0001) and distribution of virus antigen near areas of demyelination was increased (IFN-\u03b3R1 +/+ , squares, B. IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 , triangles, B). Virus was detected in 8/8 IFN-\u03b3R1 +/+ and 11/11 IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 recipient mice. When the ratio of demyelination to viral titer was compared for each sample, the decrease in demyelination in IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 recipients was magnified (IFN-\u03b3R1 +/+ black bar, IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 white bar, C, p = 0.0425). Data are presented as a summary of three experiments. viral titer is compared between IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 and IFN-\u03b3R1 +/+ recipients of CD8 T cell-enriched IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 splenocytes, the difference between groups is increased (Fig. 4C) . Therefore, IFN-\u03b3 recipient responsiveness contributes to both CD8 T cellmediated demyelination and viral clearance in RAG1-deficient mice.\n\n3.4. IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness does not contribute to viral clearance in the absence of CD8 T cells J2.2-v1-infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice do not develop demyelination despite the presence of high levels of infectious virus in the CNS (Wu and Perlman, 1999) . It is possible that NK cells, which are capable of producing significant amounts of IFN-\u03b3, may contribute to viral clearance in the absence of T cells. To test this possibility, we infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice or IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice with MHV-J2.2v-1 and compared virus titers in the brain at day 4 post-infection. As expected, viral titers were equivalent in both groups (Fig. 5A) , suggesting that viral clearance is not mediated by an IFN-\u03b3-dependent mechanism in the absence of CD8 T cells. Furthermore, no differences were detected in clinical disease or mortality between infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 and IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 5B ). 3.5. Equivalent MHV-JHM-specific CD8 T cell responses in infected IFN-\u03b3R \u2212/\u2212 RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 and IFN-\u03b3R1 +/+ RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice Although T cell IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness regulates antigen induced cell death, (Lohman and Welsh, 1998; Refaeli et al., 2002) a recent study demonstrated that IFN-\u03b3 also acts indirectly on other cells as a negative feedback regulator of T cell responses (Feuerer et al., 2006) . Therefore, the ability of antigen-specific T cells to traffic to the CNS, exhibit their effector functions, and survive in situ may be altered in the absence of IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness in recipient cells, thus decreasing both CD8 T cell-mediated macrophage activation and viral clearance. To examine this possibility, we assessed virus-specific CD8 T cell number and function by measuring IFN-\u03b3 production by cells harvested from the infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 CNS after direct ex vivo stimulation with an MHV-JHM-specific CD8 T cell peptide. At days 8-10 post-transfer, equivalent frequencies (Fig. 6A , B) and total numbers (Fig. 6C ) of CD8 T cells were isolated from RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 or IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, regardless of donor responsiveness to IFN-\u03b3. Furthermore, the number of virusspecific CD8 T cells in pre-transfer splenocyte suspensions were comparable in IFN-\u03b3R1 +/+ and IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 donors (data not shown), and were consistent with previously published results (Wu et al., 2000) . Based on these results, we conclude that decreased demyelination and increased viral titers are not a result of decreased virus-specific CD8 T cell responses in J2.2v-1infected IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice.\n\nT cells are required for the demyelination that is detected in the J2.2v-1-infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 CNS after adoptive transfer of splenocytes,, as depletion of T cells abrogated demyelination Wu et al., 2000) . In addition, our results indicate that macrophages and CD11c + DCs of donor origin do not traffic to the spinal cord in infected mice (Fig. 1) .\n\nA requirement for IFN-\u03b3 recipient responsiveness in CD8 T cell-mediated demyelination is consistent with previous studies that examined the role of IFN-\u03b3 in MHV-JHM infection. IFN-\u03b3 expressed by virus-specific CD8 T cells is critical for demyelination in infected mice, while IFN-\u03b3 also plays a role in demyelination mediated by bystander CD8 T cells and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells (Dandekar et al., 2004 . Brisebois et al. (2006) examined IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness in mice engineered to constitutively express the costimulatory molecule CD86 in microglia. These mice develop spontaneous demyelination, which is abrogated if mice are IFN-\u03b3R1deficient; these mice also lacked the characteristic microglial activation observed in wild type mice. This result suggests that microglia are a target of IFN-\u03b3, and thus, final effectors of demyelination.\n\nMicroglia/macrophages are present in demyelinating lesions in MS and in animal models of MS such as EAE, and in mice infected with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) and MHV-JHM (Hemmer et al., 2002) . Direct recruitment and activation of macrophages/microglia in the spinal cord of MHV-JHM-infected mice are sufficient to induce demyelination in the absence of T or B cells, since myelin destruction is detected in RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice infected with a recombinant MHV-JHM that expresses the macrophage chemokine CCL2 (MCP-1) (Kim and Perlman, 2005) . In wild type mice, IFN-\u03b3-mediated activation and recruitment of macrophages and microglia to sites of viral infection may also occur indirectly through other resident CNS cells. Astrocytes are the resident CNS cell type most likely to facilitate indirect cell recruitment and activation, as CCL2 is produced by astrocytes after IFN-\u03b3 treatment (Hayashi et al., 1995; Weiss et al., 1998) .\n\nIn addition to a role in demyelination, IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness in recipient mice is important for CD8 T cell-mediated viral clearance (Figs. 3 and 4) . This result is consistent with previous studies which demonstrated IFN-\u03b3 and IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness are critical for MHV-JHM clearance from myelin-producing oligodendrocytes of the CNS (Gonzalez et al., 2006; Parra et al., 1999) . The observation that IFN-\u03b3R1 deficiency in infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 recipient mice does not decrease demyelination as extensively as IFN-\u03b3 deficiency in transferred CD8 T cells may be explained by enhanced virus replication in the first group . Further, IFN-\u03b3 deficiency is limited to the donor population in CD8 T cell-enriched splenocyte transfers. Other non-T cells present in RAG1-deficient mice are capable of producing IFN-\u03b3, (Schroder et al., 2004) and thus may contribute to viral clearance in the absence of CD8 T cell IFN-\u03b3 production. In IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, however, this alternative mechanism is not possible, as the effects of IFN-\u03b3 on any host cell type are eliminated, regardless of the source of IFN-\u03b3. Thus, diminished virus clearance may result in substantial demyelination even in the absence of IFN-\u03b3R1. The primary mechanism for virus clearance from myelin-producing cells is IFN-\u03b3-mediated and our results suggest that IFN-\u03b3R1 expression in infected recipient mice is likely more critical for CD8 T cell-mediated viral clearance than for CD8 T cell-mediated demyelination.\n\nFuture studies are needed to determine the specific IFN-\u03b3responsive cell types that mediate CD8 T cell-mediated demyelination and/or viral clearance. Transgenic mice engineered to express a dominant-negative IFN-\u03b3R1 under the control of an oligodendrocyte-specific reporter demonstrated decreased viral clearance, with no decrease in demyelination (Gonzalez et al., 2006) . Also, expression of a dominant-negative IFN-\u03b3R1 in astrocytes had no effect on viral clearance or demyelination (Hindinger et al., 2005) . Our results demonstrating that recipient IFN-\u03b3R1 expression contributes to demyelination together with the observation of decreased microglial activation and spontaneous demyelination in IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 mice described by Brisebois et al. (2006) suggest that IFN-\u03b3R1 expression by macrophages/microglia is important for maximal CD8 T cellmediated demyelination. Although a transgenic mouse with macrophage-specific IFN-\u03b3R inhibition has been developed, microglia were not specifically examined in this study, (Dighe et al., 1995) . Therefore, the importance of macrophage and microglial-specific IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness in CD8 T cell-mediated demyelination during MHV-JHM infection will require further study."}
