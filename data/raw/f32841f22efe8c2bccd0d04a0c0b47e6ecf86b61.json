These findings suggest that RV1B stimulates an early immune response that clears PR8 28 while limiting excessive pulmonary inflammation. The timing of RV1B co-infection was a 29 critical determinant of protection, suggesting that sufficient time is needed to induce this 30 response. Finally, disease attenuation was not unique to RV1B: co-infection by a murine 31 coronavirus two days before PR8 also reduced disease severity. This model will be critical for Co-infection by RV leads to more rapid clearance of PR8 from the lungs 146 The above experiments established that RV effectively attenuated disease due to a mild 147 PR8 infection. We next asked whether the reduced virulence during co-infection was due to 148 inhibition of PR8 replication within the lungs. Groups of mice were either mock-inoculated or 149 inoculated with RV two days before inoculating with a low dose of PR8 (Mock/PR8, RV/PR8). 150 Groups of mice were euthanized on days 4, 7, and 10 after PR8 inoculation and lungs were 151 harvested for PR8 quantification. On day 4 after PR8 inoculation, the viral loads in single virus 152 and co-infected mice were not significantly different, but co-infected mice had greater variation 153 within the group (Fig. 2) . However, on day 7, the Mock/PR8-infected mice still had PR8 titers in 154 the 10 4 -10 5 range, whereas the RV/PR8-co-infected mice had undetectable levels of PR8. By day 155 10, both groups had undetectable levels of infectious PR8. This suggests that co-infection with 156 RV did not prevent infection or inhibit early replication of PR8, but induced more rapid 157 clearance of PR8 from the lungs. 158 We also evaluated lung sections for PR8 antigens by immunohistochemistry. The lack of 159 PR8 antigen staining in lung sections from mock-inoculated mice confirmed the specificity of 178 Next, we used a murine lung epithelial cell line (LA-4) that is susceptible to infection by 179 both viruses (30) to determine if co-infection by RV would interfere with PR8 replication in vitro. 180 LA-4 cells were inoculated with RV 6 or 12 hours before or simultaneously with PR8. PR8 181 released into the media was quantified by TCID 50 assay in MDCK cells. We confirmed that the 182 presence of RV in these samples did not interfere with quantification of PR8 in MDCK cells (not 183 shown). There were no significant differences at any time point between cells inoculated with 9 hours before PR8 (Fig. 4B) . The lower PR8 titers at 96 hours may have been due to higher cell 187 death from two viruses being present, providing fewer susceptible cells for PR8 replication.\n\nThough not significant, this trend was also seen when cells were inoculated with both viruses 189 simultaneously (Fig. 4A) . These data help corroborate our in vivo finding that RV did not inhibit 190 replication of PR8. Rather, co-infection is most likely stimulating the immune system, leading to 191 faster clearance of PR8. alveolitis. In general, inflammation was associated with dilated and congested blood capillaries 204 with extravasation of blood plasma, hemorrhage, thickened alveolar septae, collapsed alveoli, 205 and enlarged alveolar ducts observed in severe lesions (Fig. 5B, C) . Although focal inflammation 206 was found in all lobes, the right lung's caval lobe appeared to be commonly more inflamed than 207 other lobes. Pulmonary invagination was often associated with inflamed portions of the lungs.\n\n.

By day 4, lung pathology was more extensive in RV/PR8 co-210 infected mice than Mock/PR8-infected mice. However, by days 7 and 10, mice infected with 211 Mock/PR8 had more severe lung pathology than RV/PR8 co-infected mice. Overall, necrosis and 212 desquamation in the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli were more severe in Mock/PR8 213 than in RV/PR8 co-infected mice. Furthermore, excessive mucopurulent material consisting of Co-infection by RV was effective at reducing disease during a mild or moderate PR8 236 infection when given two days before PR8. We next determined whether co-infection with RV 237 simultaneously with or two days after a low or medium dose of PR8 would also ameliorate 238 disease. When RV and PR8 Low were inoculated simultaneously (RV+PR8 Low ), co-infection 239 resulted in a disease phenotype intermediate between PR8 Low alone (Mock/PR8 Low ) and RV two 240 days before PR8 Low (RV/PR8 Low ) ( Fig. 6A-C) . RV+PR8 Low co-infected mice reached 33% 241 mortality by day 9 (Fig. 6A ). This mortality was higher than mice inoculated with RV two days 242 before PR8 Low (RV/PR8 Low ), but significantly lower than the 100% mortality seen with mice 243 infected with PR8 Low alone (Mock/PR8 Low ). RV+PR8 Low -infected mice lost weight at a similar 244 rate to Mock/PR8 Low -infected mice, beginning on day 3 and continuing until day 8 before 245 recovering (Fig. 6B ). Average clinical scores were also similar between simultaneous co-246 infection and single infection, with slight lethargy, hunching, breathing, and moderate ruffling 247 detected on day 3 and 4 and peaking with moderate lethargy, hunching, breathing, and severe 248 ruffling on day 7 before co-infected mice (RV+PR8 Low ) began recovering from infection ( Fig.   249 6C). Interestingly, when RV was given two days after PR8 Low (PR8 Low /RV), co-infection 250 exacerbated PR8 disease, as evidenced by more rapid mortality, weight loss, and higher clinical 251 scores than mice infected with Mock/PR8 Low (Fig. 6A-C) . PR8 Low /RV co-infected mice began 252 dying and reached 100% mortality two days before mice inoculated with Mock/PR8 Low (Fig. 6B ).\n\n.

These increased 255 clinical scores were due to severe lethargy and ruffling, moderate hunching, and labored 256 breathing, which occurred earlier during infection compared to mice in the other groups ( Fig.   257 6C).\n\nIn contrast to PR8 Low , RV was only effective at disease attenuation when given two days 259 before a higher dose (PR8 Med ) of PR8. There were no significant differences in mortality, weight 273 We next evaluated whether attenuation of PR8 disease was limited to co-infection by RV timing of which they infect the host. We found that mice given RV two days before PR8 were 320 .

RV was less effective at 321 disease attenuation when mice were given higher doses of PR8, or RV was given at the same 322 time as PR8. Further, mice given RV two days after PR8 had enhanced disease compared to PR8 323 alone. We also found that disease attenuation was not limited to co-infection by RV. A 324 respiratory tropic strain of MHV also reduced PR8 disease when given two days before PR8. with RV two days before PR8 did not reduce PR8 levels in the lungs early in infection (Fig. 2) or 331 prevent spread of PR8 within the respiratory tract (Fig. 3) . These findings suggest that RV does 332 not directly inhibit infection by PR8, which was also confirmed by our in vitro studies (Fig. 4) .\n\nOur previous studies have shown that RV induces a robust type I IFN response in the LA-4 cell 334 line (30), thus the lack of PR8 inhibition we saw is not due to the absence of an IFN response.\n\nThis is not surprising, as the NS1 protein of PR8 is known to antagonize type I IFN responses The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Ongoing studies in our lab will determine the RV-366 induced immune components that are required for attenuation of PR8 disease during co-infection.\n\nIn contrast to the enhanced inflammation in the lungs of co-infected mice on day 4, the 368 histopathology on days 7 and 10 was less severe in co-infected compared to PR8-infected mice 369 (Fig. 5) . This could be an indirect consequence of early viral clearance (Fig. 2) This study demonstrated that RV-mediated disease attenuation was less effective as we 383 increased the dose of PR8, shortened the timing between virus inoculations, or gave RV after 384 PR8 (Figs. 1 and 6 ). These differences are likely due to the kinetics and magnitudes of RV-and that exacerbate disease when RV is given 2 days after PR8. It is possible that these are the same 393 mechanisms that reduce disease when RV is given 2 days before PR8 and that the timing of their 394 induction is key to regulating pathogenesis.
