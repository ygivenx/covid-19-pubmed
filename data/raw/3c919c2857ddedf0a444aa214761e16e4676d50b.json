{"title": "Establishment of Epstein-Barr Virus Growth-transformed Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines", "body": ". LCL have been used to present antigens in a variety of immunologic assays 2, 3 . In addition, LCL can be used to generate human monoclonal antibodies 4, 5 and provide a potentially unlimited source when access to primary biologic materials is limited 6, 7 .\n\nA variety of methods have been described to generate LCL. Earlier methods have included the use of mitogens such as phytohemagglutinin, lipopolysaccharide 8 , and pokeweed mitogen 9 to increase the efficiency of EBV-mediated immortalization. More recently, others have used immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporin A to inhibit T cell-mediated killing of infected B cells 7, [10] [11] [12] .\n\nThe considerable length of time from EBV infection to establishment of cell lines drives the requirement for quicker and more reliable methods for EBV-driven B cell growth transformation. Using a combination of high titer EBV and an immunosuppressive agent, we are able to consistently infect, transform, and generate LCL from B cells in peripheral blood. This method uses a small amount of peripheral blood mononuclear cells that are infected in vitroclusters of cells can be demonstrated. The presence of CD23 with EBV in the presence of FK506, a T cell immunosuppressant. Traditionally, outgrowth of proliferating B cells is monitored by visualization of microscopic clusters of cells about a week after infection with EBV. Clumps of LCL can be seen by the naked eye after several weeks. We describe an assay to determine early if EBVmediated growth transformation is successful even before microscopic clusters of cells can be demonstrated. The presence of CD23 hi CD58 + cells observed as early as three days post-infection indicates a successful outcome.\n\nThe An alternative is to obtain the supernatant from B95-8 cells containing EBV from the ATCC (VR-1492) and use at the dilution recommended by the ATCC.\n\n2. Underlay diluted blood with 15 ml Ficoll Hypaque lymphocyte separation medium. Centrifuge at 225 x g without brake at room temperature for 30 minutes. 3. Remove buffy coat and transfer into a new 50 ml conical tube. Raise volume to 50 ml with PBS and spin at 600 x g at room temperature for 10 minutes. 4. Pour off supernatant. Wash cells by resuspending pellet in 50 ml PBS and spinning at 600 x g at room temperature for 10 minutes. Wash twice more in a similar manner. 5. Resuspend washed cells in 1 ml of complete RPMI. Use 5 \u03bcL of cells to prepare a 1/10 dilution in Trypan blue. Count live cells using a hemocytometer. 6. Adjust the volume using complete RPMI in a 25 cm 2 tissue culture flask to obtain a cell concentration of 2 x 10 6 /ml.\n\n1. Add FK506 (AG Scientific) to the cell suspension from 2.6 to a final concentration of 20 nM. Place flask in CO 2 incubator at 37\u00b0C for one hour. 2. Rapidly thaw an aliquot of EBV. Remove flask from incubator and add EBV to the cells at 1/10 dilution. Typically, this dilution provides an MOI of 50-100. Swirl flask to mix and place it upright in CO 2 incubator at 37\u00b0C.\n\nNote that Step 4, performed to predict successful outcome, is an optional step. If\n\nStep 4 is to be performed, you will need to incubate an additional flask of un-infected PBMC at 2 x 10 6 cells/ml as control. vi. single-stained with FITC conjugated isotype control antibody matched to CD58-FITC (at the same concentration as anti-CD58 antibody) vii. single-stained with PE-Cy5 conjugated isotype control antibody matched to CD19-PE-Cy5 (at the same concentration as anti-CD19 antibody) viii. triple-stained with all three isotype control antibodies.\n\nTemporarily store the mixes at 4\u00b0C in the dark. 3. In day three post-exposure to EBV, gently swirl flask to obtain a more uniform cell suspension. Remove 2ml from flask into a 2ml Eppendorf tube. Spin tube in a microcentrifuge at 3000 rpm at room temperature for 3 minutes. antibody. Plot CD19 + live B cells with fluorescence intensity for CD23 on x-axis and fluorescence intensity for CD58 on y-axis. Determine CD23 + and CD58 + cells by comparing to EBV-exposed cells stained with matched isotype control antibodies. Presence of CD23 hi CD58 + cells in EBV-exposed culture ( Figure 2C ) predicts successful outgrowth of EBV-infected growth transformed cells. In contrast, CD23 hi CD58 + cells do not emerge when cells are not exposed to EBV (Figure 2A ) or exposed to a non-immortalizing strain of EBV ( Figure 2B ). CD23 hi CD58 + cells have been experimentally demonstrated to undergo proliferation and subsequently establish LCL (14).\n\n1. Visualization of cells by light microscopy: By a week after EBV infection, clusters of cells are visible by light microscopy. Figure 3 shows an example of early microscopic clusters ( Figure 3B ) in a flask. 2. As time progresses, microscopic clusters become larger such that clumps are visible macroscopically in the flask. Figure 3C shows larger clusters of cells in established LCL by light microscopy. 3. Feeding cells: Double the volume of culture medium in the culture flask on day 12. Subsequently, expand culture by increasing its volume 2-3 fold using complete RPMI. 4. Periodicity of feeding cells should be determined based on rate of cell growth. When the culture medium turns yellow, it is generally time to replace the media as above. Typically, this occurs once per week. However, some cell lines may need to be fed more or less frequently. Expand culture to 75-100 ml over the next few weeks. 5. Cryopreservation: When freezing down cells, centrifuge cells at 600 x g for 10 minutes at room temperature. Remove the supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in cold freezing medium containing 90% FBS and 10% dimethylsulfoxide at 1 x 10 7 cells/ml. Place tube in liquid nitrogen. . Un-infected cells ( Figure 2A ) and cells exposed to EBV from HH514-16 cells (Figure 2B ), harboring a non-immortalizing strain of EBV, do not demonstrate CD23 hi CD58 + cells.\n\nYou may also visualize cells by light microscopy to monitor successful outcome: As mentioned earlier, within a week after EBV infection, small clusters of cells in the flask are visible by light microscopy ( Figure 3B ). As time progresses and cells develop into LCL, microscopic clusters become larger ( Figure 3C ) such that clumps are visible macroscopically in the flask. PBMC present in the buffy coat of an established gradient are exposed to FK506 followed by addition of EBV. EBV-exposed cells are grown at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO 2 to establish and subsequently expand LCL for cryopreservation."}
