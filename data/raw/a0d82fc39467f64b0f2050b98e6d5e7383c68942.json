{"title": "", "body": "Acute infectious nonbacterial gastroenteritis (AING) in children is a common cause of hospitalization.\n\nFirst described by Zahorsky as \"winter vomiting disease,\" it has long been assumed to be due to viral etiologies. 1 Only recent-01y with the advent of newer technologies have we been able to identify specific v~ruses in infected patients.\n\nMost AING has been attributed to rotavirus and Norwalk-like viruses.\n\nOther viruses, including corona virus~like particles, adenoviruses, astroviruses and caliciviruses may also cause AING. 2, 3 Diagnoses are made with the aid of electron microscopy (EM), immunoelectronmicroscopy, tissue culture, and a variety of serologic techniques including enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and radioimmunoassay (RIA). 4 Demonstration of the virus in stool along with serologic evidence of antibody in patients with gastroenteritis is strong evidence for a causative role of the virus.\n\nWe know most about Norwalk-like viruses and rotaviruses.\n\nNorwalk virus and Norwalk-like viruses ire associated with gastroenteritis, usually outside the infant age group. 5 This disease has an explosive onset, short duration (24 to 48 hours), is usually self-limited and characteristically occurs in epidemics. Symptoms include yomiting, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal cramps, low-grade fever, anorexia, headache, malaise and myalgias. Mucosal lesions of the proximal small bowel are produced by the virus.\n\nAntibody is present in most adults, usually first appearing during late adolescence and early adult life.\n\nThe role of antibody in immunity to reinfection is not clear.\n\nDiagnosis is made by immunoelectronmicroscopy.\n\nRadioimmunoassay can also be used.\n\nNeither of these techniques is available on a routine basis in most clinical settings which makes diagnosis difficult.\n\nRotavirus AING is a disease of infants and young children.\n\nIt usually occurs during cooler months in temperate climates.\n\nThe illness is more prolonged than Norwalk-like virus AING (usually about one week) and is potentially more serious.\n\nRotavirus AING results in significant morbidity and mortality in third world nations and accounts for a significant number of infant hospitalizations in the United States. 6 Most children over 2 years of age have antibody. Antibody appears to be serotype specific.\n\nThere are at least two serotypes of rotavirus that afflict humans. 3\n\nSymptoms include diarrhea which is usually severeand watery; vomiting and fever may accompany the diarrhea.\n\nSevere dehydration may ensue resulting in hospitalization.\n\nThe diagnosis of rotavirus AING is by EM of stool specimens.\n\nThis method is not readily available in most settings. Alternatives include ELISA and RIA.\n\nTherapy for AING, regardless of viral etiology, is fluid and electrolyte replacement.\n\nThere is not any available antiviral therapy for these infections. Prevention depends on interrupting the fecal-oral route cycle.\n\nImmunization against rotavirus is still in the experimental state but may be available in a few years.\n\nThere is not yet a candidate Norwalk-virus vaccine developed.\n\nAcute infectious nonbacterial gastroenteritis results in high morbidity and mortality in developing nations.\n\nIn the United States, it accounts for a significant number of infant hospitalizations as well as days lost from school or work."}
