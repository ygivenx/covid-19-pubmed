{"title": "", "body": "Several important diseases of rabbits have a nutrition component in their etiology. In fact, nearly all of the economically significant pathological states can be influenced to some extent by diet. Enteric diseases are closely linked with diet and feeding practices. Respiratory diseases, such as pasteurellosis, are influ enced by environmental conditions, particularly the ammonia concentrations in the air. Ammonia production in the rabbitry is in part a function of the diet the animals are fed. Fur chewing and trichobezoars (hair balls) are largely due to feeding inadequacies. Other disease conditions, including hydrocephalus and ketosis, can be associated with nutritional status.\n\nEnteric diseases, along with respiratory disease, are a major problem in com mercial rabbit production. Loss from enteritis of 10-20% of all animals born is routine, on a worldwide basis. Additionally, outbreaks of enteritis sometimes occur, causing devastating losses of 20-60% of all young animals. While there is not yet a full understanding of the causes of enteritis, and more importantly, measures for prevention and treatment are not always effective, great progress has been made in elucidating the disruptions of physiological processes that underlie the condition. The rabbit digestive tract performs very complex func tions, particularly in the hindgut where selective retention of fermentable sub strate in the cecum occurs, followed by cecotrophy. It is not surprising that disruptions of these mechanisms can occur, with disastrous results for the animal.\n\nThe causes of enteritis can be considered in terms of the microbes responsible, and the factors that allow these microbes to become a problem. These factors include diet, stress, and genetic predisposition to gut dysfunction. These factors will be considered separately, and then integrated into a unifying concept of diarrhea in the rabbit.\n\nThere are a number of types of enteric diseases in rabbits, often referred to as enteritis complex. Enterotoxemia is a major problem, caused by the proliferation of pathogens (mainly Clostridium species) in the cecum, with the elaboration of toxins that are absorbed and exert toxicological effects. The term \"mucoid enteritis\" is sometimes used to describe a condition characterized by cecal im paction, mucus accumulation in the hindgut and excretion of mucus in the feces, and apparent diarrhea.\n\nDiarrhea in the rabbit is somewhat unusual in that it is associated with con stipation, or lack of gut motility. It would normally be considered that diarrhea and constipation are mutually exclusive terms.\n\nFor many years, the understanding of enteritis was limited by a lack of knowl edge of specific microorganisms involved, and an inability to induce enteritis by administration of microbes. Since the late 1970s, much progress has been made in identifying the causative organisms.\n\nEnterotoxemia in rabbits was first described in 1936 by French scientists (Lesbouyries and Berthelon, 1936) . Patton et al. (1978) identified Clostridium perfringens type \u0395 iota toxin as the probable causative agent in enterotoxemia in Oregon rabbits. The toxicity of diarrheal rabbits' cecal contents injected into mice and rabbits was neutralized by C. perfringens type \u0395 antitoxin, implicating the involvement of iota toxin. However, C. perfringens type \u0395 could not be isolated from rabbits with diarrhea. Baskerville et al. (1980) and Eaton and Fernie (1980) confirmed the involvement of iota toxin, but, like Patton et al. (1978) , they were unable to isolate the causative organism. This enigma was solved by Carman and Borriello (1982) , who identified a new species, Clostrid ium spiroforme, as the source of the iota toxin. In a series of reports (Carman and Borriello, 1982; Borriello, 1983, 1984; Carman, 1983, 1985; Carman and Evans, 1984) , these authors defined the nature of the infection. Clostridium spiroforme ( Fig. 12. 2) is an anaerobic, gram-positive, helically coiled, spore-forming bacillus (Borriello et al., 1986 ) that produces iota toxin that is neutralized by C. perfringens type \u0395 antitoxin. Rabbit diarrhea caused by C. spiroforme has been demonstrated in Great Britain, western Eu rope, the United States Peeters et al., 1986b) , and Australia (Harris and Portas, 1985) , so it appears to be involved in rabbit enteritis on a global basis. Carman and Borriello (1983) have shown that newly weaned rabbits may develop iota enterotoxemia upon exposure to C. spiroforme, while adult animals generally require some environmental stress to induce modifications of the nor mal gut microflora for enterotoxemia to develop. Administration of antibiotics, such as clindamycin, may disturb the gut microflora and result in C. spiroformeinduced enteritis (Katz et al., 1978; LaMont et al., 1979; Rehg and Pakes, 1982) .\n\nClostridium spiroforme may be present as a normal gut inhabitant without inducing enteritis. One factor involved in enteritis is whether or not toxin produc tion occurs. Toxin production by C. spiroforme requires the presence of glucose (Carman and Evans, 1984) , an observation consistent with the carbohydrate overload theory of enteritis . It is grown on a medium with chopped meat, suggesting that high dietary protein levels may favor its growth. This is often the case with Clostridium species.\n\nWhile it seems clear that C. spiroforme is an important cause of rabbit diar rhea, it is not the only cause. The other major organism that has been implicated is Escherichia coli. Although E. coli is not a significant normal inhabitant of the rabbit gut, it may be found in large numbers in the cecum of rabbits with diarrhea. Prescott (1978) reported an outbreak of diarrhea in weanling rabbits associated with E. coli, and suggested that death may be caused by hypo glycemia or electrolyte imbalance, arising from cecal lesions and absorption of bacterial endotoxin. Peeters et al. (1984a Peeters et al. ( ,b, 1985a Peeters et al. ( , 1986a , in Belgium, have observed field outbreaks of enteritis apparently caused by various strains of E. coli. The strains of E. coli implicated in rabbit diarrhea are known as attaching organisms, because they attach to the intestinal mucosa. They attach first to the Peyer's patch epithelium (Cantey and Inman, 1981) and later to the enterocytes of the small intestine, cecum, and colon. Peyer's patches are lymph nodules visible as irregular raised plaques on the intestinal mucosa. The Peyer's patches are involved in immune systems of the intestine, producing \u03a4 lymphocytes which function in resistance to bacterial toxins. Majumder and Ali (1986) observed that in rabbits fed low protein diets, the number and size of Peyer's patches were reduced, suggesting that inadequate dietary protein may increase the susceptibili ty to enteric pathogens. Peeters et al. (1985a) found that enteropathogenic E. coli caused extensive destruction of the mucosa of the small intestine, cecum, and colon ( Fig. 12.3) . The lesions probably interfere with normal intestinal and cecal function. Peeters et al. (1984a) surveyed a number of rabbitries in Belgium for the presence of infectious agents, and examined diarrheal rabbits from these rabbi tries (Table 12 .1). Escherichia coli and Clostridium species were the major pathogenic bacteria. Rotavirus was also very common. Rotaviruses seem to be endemic in commercial rabbitries but are only mildly pathogenic. They destroy cells that synthesize disaccharidases (Peeters et al., 1984a) . Inadequate digestion of disaccharides (e.g., sucrose) could aggravate enteritis caused by other patho gens, and could contribute to carbohydrate overload of the hindgut. Suckling rabbits with E. coli infection die within 48 hr after showing a yellow ish diarrhea (Peeters et al., 1984a) . Yellow diarrhea in kits 5-15 days of age can be a major problem. For example, a large Brazilian rabbitry has routinely ob served a death loss of 15% of suckling kits from yellow diarrhea (Cheeke, 1985) .\n\nCoccidiosis has been implicated in rabbit diarrhea. Various species of Eimer ia, the protozoan responsible for coccidiosis, are common inhabitants of the rabbit gut, and contribute to damage to mucosal surfaces. Coccidiosis can be viewed as a contributor to enteritis but is not generally the primary cause (Meshorer, 1976) .\n\nTo summarize, the major bacteria involved in enterotoxemia are Clostridium species, particularly C. spiroforme, and E. coli. Rotaviruses and coccidiosis may aggravate enteric disease but are not normally the primary agents involved.\n\nNumerous investigators (Colin et al., 1976; Cheeke and Patton, 1978; Laplace, 1978; Pote et al., 1980; Spreadbury and Davidson, 1978) have noted that dietary fiber has a protective effect against diarrhea. The beneficial effects of fiber are associated with lignocellulose, the more indigestible components of plant fiber. Highly digestible fiber sources, such as beet pulp, do not have enteritis-preventing properties. Acid detergent fiber (ADF) measures cellulose and lignin, so it is probably the best analytical technique for estimating indigesti ble fiber. European workers (e.g., Colin et al., 1976) use the term \"ballast\" to describe indigestible fiber. One favorable effect of \"ballast\" or indigestible fiber is to provide bulk and a source of large particles in the hindgut. Fiber stimulates cecal-colonic motility (Laplace, 1978) , either by a direct stimulatory effect on the mucosa, or a distention effect of the bulk. Low-fiber diets cause cecalcolonic hypomotility (Laplace, 1978) , which predisposes the animal to abnormal cecal fermentation and diarrhea. The hypomotility results in prolonged retention times of digesta in the cecum, allowing changes in cecal pH, VFA production, and substrate concentrations, ultimately causing changes in the cecal microflora populations.\n\nAnother possible effect of fiber is an indirect one. When high-fiber diets are formulated, the levels of ingredients providing readily available carbohydrate (e.g., starch) are usually reduced. The apparently favorable effects of the in creased fiber may in fact be from the lower content of readily fermented carbohy drate. Cheeke and Patton (1980) proposed that enterotoxemia arises from carbo hydrate overload of the hindgut. High levels of dietary starch may result in undigested starch passing through the small intestine and serving as a substrate for bacterial growth in the hindgut. This may provide an environment in which pathogens such as E. coli and Clostridium species may proliferate. The presence of glucose, which would arise from starch digestion, is necessary for toxin production by C. spiroforme . Thus, a low-fiber, high-starch diet establishes gut conditions of hypomotility and prolonged avail ability of substrate (starch) to cecal bacteria, allowing pathogens to proliferate and produce toxins that kill the rabbit. Morisse et al. (1979) and Morisse et al. (1985) have suggested that a pre disposing factor to diarrhea is reduced acidity (a more alkaline pH) of the cecal contents. The pH is determined mainly by the metabolism of VFA, including their rate of production and rate of absorption. Morisse and co-workers believe that suboptimal VFA production leads to an increased cecal pH, resulting in a change in the microflora, with increases in E. coli and Clostridium species. Morisse et al. (1979) reported that administering sources of acid in the drinking water increased the acidity of the cecum, and reduced enteritis incidence. They administered acetic acid, lactic acid, and lactulose (a synthetic disaccharide not hydrolyzed in the small intestine), and noted a lower cecal pH and a reduced incidence of enteritis. In another experiment, they induced enteritis by admin istration of ampicillin. The control group had 55% mortality, while those receiv ing acetic acid and lactulose had mortality rates of 19% and 8.7%, respectively. Lelkes (1986) suggested that the critical event leading to enteritis is a drop in the cecal pH as a result of vigorous fermentation of carbohydrate. He hypoth esized that hyperacidity of the cecum destabilizes the microbial population, and is the \"smoking gun\" responsible for the proliferation of pathogens. He main tains that the subsequent alkalinity of the cecum is due to compensatory mecha nisms such as secretion of alkaline fluids into the intestine and secretion of mucus, which has buffering capacity. He noted that mucus was very alkaline and that probably hypersecretion of mucus (in mucoid enteritis) is a physiological mechanism to neutralize the hyperacidity occurring in the early stages of the disease. Part of the beneficial effect of fiber in preventing enteritis may relate to its buffering capacity. Morisse et al. (1985) studied the effect of diet composition on gut function and microbiology. They fed a control diet, similar to normal commercial diets, a high-fiber diet, and a diet high in soluble carbohydrates. The high-fiber diet resulted in a reduction in cecal VFA levels, and a reduction in butyrate and an increase in propionate as proportions of total VFA, and increases in cecal pH and ammonia (Table 12 .2). The cecal microflora differed between diets, with the high fermentable carbohydrate diet causing a marked reduction in the normal Bacteroides, and increases in E. coli and Clostridium species (Fig. 12.4) . Mor isse et al. (1985) interpreted the results to indicate that a diet high in fermentable carbohydrate results in high cecal VFA production, keeping the cecum acidic, and preventing changes in microflora, aiding in the prevention of enteritis. However, the changes in cecal bacteria ( Fig. 12.4) suggest that a diet high in soluble carbohydrates promotes the development of a microflora dominated by E. coli and Clostridium species, supporting the carbohydrate overload concept. As discussed previously (Chapter 6), the rabbit is unusual in that butyric acid is a more important VFA than propionic acid as an end product of cecal fermen tation. This may be important in preventing enteritis. Rolfe (1984) , in studies with hamsters, noted that cecal VFA, and particularly butyric acid, are inhibitory to the growth of Clostridium difficile. The more acid the cecum, the more inhibitory were the VFA. The greater effectiveness of butyric acid than of acetic acid may be explained by the greater proportion of butyric acid in the undissociated state at the normal pH of the cecum; it is the undissociated acid molecules that are inhibitory to bacterial growth (Rolfe, 1984) . In rabbits with diarrhea, the proportion of butyric acid was reduced to 17% of total VFA as compared to a value of 27% in controls (Morisse et al., 1985) . Morisse et al. (1985) found that with a high-fiber diet, the cecal ammonia concentration was elevated (Table 12. 2). They suggest that a high ammonia level allows greater dissociation of VFA, with a drop in their effectiveness in inhibit- were found in animals fed the control diet (vertical hatching) or the high-fiber diet (dotted area). (Data from Morisse et al, 1985.) ing growth of E. coli and Clostridium species. A high dietary protein level could have an aggravating effect on enteritis, by increasing the cecal ammonia level. Sanchez et al. (1985) noted a tendency for enteritis mortality to increase as the dietary protein level was increased from 17.5% to 20.5%.\n\nThe preceding discussion suggests that a diet with sufficient indigestible fiber to maintain cecal motility as well as an abundance but not an excess of fermenta ble substrate to maintain acidic conditions in the hindgut might be the optimal dietary state for maximum performance and minimum enteritis. A minimum dietary crude fiber level of 10% is suggested for minimizing enteritis incidence (de Bias etal., 1986) .\n\nHungarian workers Kutas, 1973, 1974) studied physiological pa rameters in rabbits with E. co//-induced enteritis. This is the most important disease of rabbits in Hungary, with losses exceeding those from all other diseases combined. Two peaks of incidence are in the postweaning period (4-11 weeks) and in suckling kits (2-8 days of age). Changes in physiological parameters with enteritis (Table 12. 3) indicate dehydration (increase in hematocrit and serum protein), a marked rise in serum urea, metabolic acidosis (reduced blood pH),\n\ns \u03bf severe blood base deficit (reduced plasma bicarbonate), and acid urine. Vetesi and Kutas (1973) explain the sequence of events as follows. Escherichia coli, for some reason, proliferates in the hindgut. Toxins produced by the bacteria damage the gut mucosa, resulting in hypersecretion of mucus, water, and elec trolytes into the gut. Reabsorption of the alkaline digestive secretions is im paired. The contents of the hindgut become watery and alkaline. The loss from the blood of water, electrolytes, and bases causes severe disturbances in body fluids. The cessation of cecotrophy during diarrhea further increases the losses of water and electrolytes. Dehydration characterized by decreased plasma volume and decreased serum sodium occurs. These alterations cause decreased cardiac function, a decline in blood pressure, and symptoms of shock. Absorbed bacte rial toxins cause toxic reactions including impaired liver function, as evidenced by the marked rise in plasma urea. Depletion of liver and heart glycogen is observed (Vetesi and Kutas, 1974) , further aggravating the shock condition.\n\nSimilar effects may be produced by Clostridium toxins. Stringer (1985) re viewed the mode of action of Clostridium enterotoxins. The enterotoxins cause increased capillary permeability and vasodilation (thus reducing blood pressure). The intestine shows increased secretion of fluid and sodium, inhibition of chlo ride and glucose uptake, and sloughing of epithelial cells. Liver function, as assessed by oxygen consumption of liver mitochondria, is impaired. Other evi dence of impaired liver function includes elevated blood ammonia and liver lesions. A hyperlipemia occurs, with elevated plasma triglycerides. This is prob ably due to mobilization of body fat for energy, after the cessation of feed intake. The effects on capillary permeability would explain the hemorrhage and edema of the cecal wall seen in enterotoxemia . Licois et al. (1978a,b) studied fluid and electrolyte metabolism in rabbits with diarrhea induced by infection with coccidiosis. While coccidiosis-induced diar rhea may not exactly duplicate changes in enterotoxemia, it may be a model for general effects of diarrhea on rabbit physiology. Changes in fluid balance and electrolyte metabolism were shown earlier (Table 8 .3). In diarrhea, there was a net loss of sodium and potassium and decreased plasma sodium. The hematocrit was 41.7% in control animals, and 35.1% in infected animals, quite similar to values reported by Vetesi and Kutas (1973) (Table 12. 3). Other changes noted with diarrhea were decreases in plasma sodium, potassium, and chloride, and elevated plasma urea. These authors suggested that the high blood urea nitrogen level was a reflection of the breakdown of body tissue, since the rabbits may lose 10% of their body weight in 3 days after diarrhea begins, and this loss was not due to dehydration and increased water excretion. Lipemia, with elevated plasma triglycerides and ketone bodies, occurs and is a symptom of fasting ketosis in diarrhetic rabbits (Coudert et al., 1978) . This may also explain the elevated serum cholesterol levels seen in rabbits with diarrhea (Ekpenyong, 1986; Gascon and Verde, 1985) .\n\nEnteritis can be induced by antibiotic administration. This is due to a suppres sion of other organisms, allowing Clostridium species to proliferate. Clin damycin has been used to induce enterotoxemia in rabbits for experimental purposes (Katz et al., 1978) , and results in growth of C. spiroforme and produc tion of iota toxin (LaMont et al., 1979; Rehg and Pakes, 1982) . Other antibiotics may cause enteritis, including lincomycin, penicillin, ampicillin, and erythromy cin (Thilsted et al., 1981) . These antibiotics selectively kill gram-positive aer obes and certain gram-negative anaerobes, allowing proliferation of nonsensitive organisms, including E. coli and Clostridium species. Outbreaks of enteritis may occur when rabbit feed is contaminated with antibiotic-containing feed intended to be used for another animal species.\n\nSusceptibility to enteritis may have a genetic component. A strain of nonalbino white rabbits with pigmented eyes was observed to be susceptible to diarrhea (M. A. Grobner, P. R. Cheeke, and \u039d. M. Patton, unpublished observa tions). Evidence of insufficient nerve ganglia in the intestine was seen, suggest ing that inadequate neural supply to the gut in this strain could cause hypo motility. A similar defect has been noted in white progeny of overo spotted horses (Hultgren, 1982) . Hultgren states that during embryonic development, both melanocytes (pigment cells) and myenteric ganglia cells (intestinal nerve cells) arise from the neural crest. Retinal pigment cells originate from neural ectoderm and not from neural crest. Thus a white rabbit with pigmented eyes could have a deficiency of innervation to the gut, leading to hypomotility and susceptibility to enteritis. Another mechanism by which genetic susceptibility to enteritis could occur is from activity of gastrointestinal hormones. Bishop et al. (1984) described a condition known as grass sickness in horses, in which gut motility ceases, and the colon becomes impacted with hard feces and mucus. A deficiency of a class of gastrointestinal hormones known as regulatory peptides in affected horses was found. These peptides include substance \u03a1 and vasointestinal polypeptide (VIP). These hormones are released from nerve cells, and stimulate intestinal motility. Bishop et al. (1984) suggested that a neurotoxin could be involved in grass sickness, causing damage to the enteric nerves, leading to bowel stasis. It is possible that bacterial toxins in the rabbit gut could likewise inhibit secretion of regulatory peptides, leading to hypomotility and enteritis.\n\nStress seems to increase enteritis incidence. Stress can inhibit intestinal motility, by direct neural effects and epinephrine-mediated action. Sudden changes in environmental temperature can affect feed intake, and may influence gut motility. A sudden cold spell is often followed by an enteritis outbreak. This can be rationalized on the basis of a sudden increase in feed intake, leading to carbohydrate overload of the hindgut. Monnier and Desbals (1985) studied the relationship of stress to diarrhea. They measured plasma ACTH (adrenocor ticotropic hormone), a hormone regulating secretion of adrenal hormones in response to stress, in rabbits with diarrhea and in rabbits stressed by transport by car. In rabbits with diarrhea, plasma ACTH and total corticosteroids were 293 pg and 111 ng/ml, respectively, while corresponding control values were 130 pg and 66 ng/ml. Moving animals J>y car resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in ACTH levels. These workers believe that stress, documented by changes in adrenal hormones in the plasma, is a causal factor in rabbit diarrhea. Vitamin C may reduce the effects of stress in rabbits (Verde and Piquer, 1986) and may also inhibit toxin production by Clostridium spiroforme (Grobner et al., 1986) . Fur ther studies on the effects of vitamin C are required before its potential as a feed or water additive to reduce enteritis can be assessed.\n\nThis term has been suggested for a situation in which young kits, 3-6 days of age, die in the nest box with full stomachs, indicating that they did not die from lack of milk intake. It is postulated that bacterial toxins are absorbed from the gut by the doe, and passed in the milk. If the kits are more sensitive to the toxins than the doe, they may be killed at a concentration of toxins that has no observable effect on the mother. While this is a rational explanation for one of the major causes of nest box mortality, it has not been proven experimentally. If milk enterotoxemia is suspected, a reduction of feed given to the doe for the first week after kindling is indicated. It is important that the body condition of the doe and the presence of large amounts of milk curd in the stomachs of the kits be assessed, because another cause of neonatal mortality is inadequate nutrient intake of the does. Feed restriction would aggravate this situation (Fig. 12.5 ).\n\nAnother disorder commonly afflicting rabbits is cecal impaction (mucoid en teritis). A thorough description of the symptoms has been provided by Van Kruingen and Williams (1972) . As in enterotoxemia, this is a paradoxical situa tion in which signs of diarrhea are evident in animals that are constipated. Cecal impaction seems to be a result of similar circumstances that induce enterotox emia, but insufficient bacterial toxins are produced to kill the animal. Cecal motility is impaired, and a hard mass of fine particulate matter accumulates in the cecum. Impaction is. often noted under conditions of high environmental tem perature. The cecum is a large reservoir of body water, and if tissue water needs are not met by direct water consumption, fluid can be drawn into the blood from the cecum. Conditions that might reduce water intake below requirements are Fig. 12.5 Comparison of a \"starve-out\" (left) and a kit with a milk curd in the stomach (right). Kits that develop milk enterotoxemia have the appearance of the animal on the right. The \"starveout\" condition may be caused by inadequate feed or energy intake of does. (Courtesy of Dr. H. C. Loliger, Institute for Small Animal Sciences, Celle, Federal Republic of Germany.) high environmental temperature (Prud'hon, 1976 ) and a high water temperature. Thus, a low-fiber diet, causing cecal-colonic hypomotility, along with conditions resulting in excessive water uptake from the cecum, could cause cecal impaction. Procedures to increase water intake, such as increasing the salt content of the diet, may aid in preventing impaction.\n\nThe possible involvement of the water-absorbing properties of dietary fiber in impaction is suggested by the observation that highly hydrophilic (water-absorb ing) materials, such as guar gum and psyllium hydrophilic mucilloid (psyllium is a plant grown in India from which a highly water-absorbing fiber is obtained for manufacture of laxatives), cause severe intestinal dehydration in laboratory ani mals (Struthers, 1986) . The psyllium colloid absorbs over 40 g of water per gram of dry weight, whereas wheat bran absorbs 2-3 g water per gram of dry weight.\n\nFeeding a highly water-absorbant material causes intestinal blockage and dam age to the intestinal mucosa. Struthers (1986) cites research that feeding 10% psyllium husk to rabbits caused damage to the intestinal mucosa, by dehydrating the tissues of the intestinal wall. Based on these effects of an extreme situation, it is reasonable to speculate that diets high in water-absorbing capacity may induce impaction in rabbits. One mechanism by which cecal impaction could be induced is that dehydration of the cecum could occur to replenish water in the blood that has been secreted into the stomach to hydrate the ingested feed. In other words, when the feed has a high water-absorbing capacity, it must absorb a lot of water in the stomach to produce the normal fluid gut contents. This water comes primarily from the blood. A sudden demand for water in the stomach following eating could result in withdrawal of water from the cecum, which serves as a reservoir of body water. Thus the impaction could occur in the cecum even though the actual water uptake by feed occurs in the stomach and upper small intestine ( Fig. 12.6 ). Toofanian and Targowski (1986) demonstrated that a substance produced in the cecum of rabbits with mucoid enteritis stimulates the production and secre tion of mucus by goblet cells in the colon. Various factors, including mechanical and chemical irritation and bacterial toxins, cause increased goblet cell secretion. Lelkes and Chang (1987) observed that an organism that is or is similar to Clostridium cocleatum is invariably present in the cecum when mucoid enteritis occurs. They postulated that this organism may secrete an enterotoxin that stimu lates mucus secretion. Clostridium cocleatum is quite similar in appearance to C. spiroforme (Kaneuchi et al., 1979) . Hamar (1985, 1986) reported evidence of abnormal cecal fer mentation in rabbits with mucoid enteritis. The proportions of acetate and buty rate in the cecal contents were reduced in comparison to normal cecal contents, while proportions of propionate, isobutyrate, valerate, and isovalerate were in creased. These indicate abnormal fermentation, which is probably a consequence of, rather than a cause of, the cecal dysfunction. Similarly, Lelkes (1986) noted that the cecal contents taken from rabbits with mucoid enteritis had a much lower rate of glucose fermentation in vitro than those obtained from healthy animals. Microbial changes, with proliferation of opportunistic species, often occur after the onset of mucoid enteritis (McLeod and Katz, 1986) . Morisse et al. (1985) coined the term \"cecal paresis-pulmonary edema'' to describe the condition seen when lung damage accompanies cecal impaction. Principal factors in the etiology of this condition are cecal impaction and en vironmental conditions such as cold and drafts. Bacterial toxins may cause lung damage, so perhaps absorbed toxin (e.g., clostridial iota toxin) may be responsi ble for the lung edema, especially as the iota toxin is known to increase capillary permeability.\n\nFor experimental purposes, mucoid enteritis can be induced by ligating the Fig. 12 .6 A possible mechanism to explain cecal impaction. When feed with a high waterabsorbing capacity is consumed, large amounts of water may be secreted into the stomach. Re plenishment of this water lost from the blood may be by uptake of water from the cecum, causing impaction of cecal contents. cecum (Sinkovics, 1986; Targowski and Toofanian, 1982; Toofanian and Targowski, 1983) .\n\nTyzzer's disease is an infectious disease of rabbits that causes diarrhea, and may sometimes be implicated with outbreaks of enteritis in commercial rabbitries (Peeters et al., 1985b) . It is caused by a rod-shaped, motile organism, Bacillus piliformis, which can be identified microscopically with appropriate staining techniques. Because diagnosis of Tyzzer's disease is somewhat difficult, it is possible that it is more widespread in commercial rabbitries than generally be lieved (Peeters et al., 1985b) . The organism is resistant to many antibiotics; oxytetracycline is active against it (Peeters et al., 1985b) . Borriello and Carman (1985) have proposed that the organism is not a Bacillus but rather is a Clostridium spp., which they have named Clostridium piliformis (Carmen and Evans, 1984) .\n\nTwo forms of coccidiosis, an intestinal and a liver form, occur in rabbits. Both types may cause diarrhea, so should be considered as possible causative agents when enteritis occurs. Coccidiosis is caused by various species of Eimeria, a protozoan parasite. At least nine Eimeria species occur in rabbits (Peeters et al., 1981) . A number of species can cause intestinal coccidiosis. Eimeria steidae causes liver coccidiosis, which may have effects on digestion because of the impairment of bile secretion with liver damage.\n\nCoccidiosis can be treated with coccidiostats such as sulfaquinoxaline, which is given in the water (0.04%) or in the feed (0.025%). The coccidiostat should be given for at least 3 weeks to clear up an outbreak. Coccidiosis can be controlled with good sanitation. The protozoa produce oocytes (eggs), which are excreted in the rabbit feces. The oocytes cannot reinfect the rabbit until they have sporulated, which requires a period of incubation of at least 24 hr outside the rabbit. If the fecal pellets are knocked from the cage every day, there will be little oppor tunity for the rabbit to become reinfected, and the disease will gradually disap pear from the rabbitry. On the other hand, Sinkovics (1984) presents evidence that ingestion of just one oocyte could give rise to 26 million protozoans, so the likelihood of complete control with sanitation alone is questionable. Sinkovics (1984) believes that coccidiosis is a component of most enteritis outbreaks in rabbits. The role of coccidia could be a direct pathological effect on the intestinal mucosa, allowing invastion by other agents such as viruses and bacteria. Also, according to Sinkovics (1984) , coccidiosis causes a pronounced inhibition of intestinal motility, which, as described earlier, is a feature of enteritis. It is likely that coccidiosis is a contributing factor to many outbreaks of rabbit diarrhea. Different species of Eimeria may occupy different locations in the gut. For example, E. intestinalis infects the epithelial cells of the ileum, whereas E. pellerdyi colonizes the crypts of Lieberkuhn of the cecum and colon (Licois et al., 1978a) . In spite of their different habitats, their effects on enteritis are similar.\n\nCoccidiosis can affect nutrient digestion and metabolism. Diel (1960) found that liver coccidiosis adversely affects the metabolism of fat-soluble vitamins. The liver levels of vitamin A and vitamin \u0395 were depressed in E. stiedae-initcttd rabbits (Table 12 .4). This may mean that coccidiosis infection increases the requirements for these vitamins in rabbits.\n\nIn chickens, coccidiosis affects mineral metabolism. Infection increases liver copper levels and intensifies copper toxicity Baker, 1982, 1983; Czarnecki and Baker, 1984) , and intensifies zinc deficiency (Southern and Baker, 1983) . These relationships have not been investigated in rabbits, but could be of significance. For example, since coccidiosis infection causes in creased liver copper levels and enhanced copper toxicity (in chicks), it might have an effect on the response to copper as a feed additive in rabbit diets. Yvore and Guillaume (1976) studied the effects of hepatic coccidiosis on the digestibility of fat and energy. They hypothesized that since E. stiedai grows in the biliary canals and adversely affects hepatic function, it might have an effect on digestive processes through inhibition of bile secretion. Animals free of E. stiedai were used as controls, and a similar group was infected with 10,000 oocysts per animal. The results (Table 12.5) show that infection with liver coccidiosis markedly impaired fat digestion, and reduced the digestible energy content accordingly. Reduction in digestibility of other components is indicated by the decreased digestibility of dry matter. Gain was markedly depressed, and pronounced enlargement of the liver occurred. It is apparent that infection with coccidiosis can have pronounced effects on diet utilization by rabbits, as well as having a role in enteric disease.\n\nPregnancy toxemia (ketosis) is a disease that can affect many different ani mals. It is a major problem in livestock, particularly with dairy cattle and sheep. As the name implies, it occurs with pregnant animals, or in the case of dairy cows, in the period immediately following parturition when heavy lactation begins. It is associated with a combination of a high nutritional demand and conditions that limit intake, so that the animal cannot consume enough feed to meet its energy needs. To make up for the energy deficit, body fat is mobilized. Ketosis results when the carbohydrate-metabolizing metabolic pathway (citric acid cycle) is not able to metabolize all of the acetic acid produced from the metabolism of fatty acids arising from body fat. The acetic acid that cannot be further metabolized is converted to compounds called ketone bodies, which are Fig. 12.7 Fatty liver, resulting from mobilization of body fat following inhibition of feed intake by a hair ball in the stomach. excreted in the urine, and in the case of acetone, in the expired air from the lungs. The smell of acetone can be detected in the breath of animals with ketosis. As a result of the inability to utilize the fat reserves in normal metabolism, fat accumulates in the liver, causing a fatty liver condition (Fig. 12.7) . The ketone bodies may cause metabolic problems such as acidosis. The affected animal suffers an insufficiency of cellular energy. The brain is particularly affected because of its high metabolic rate. The animal goes into a coma, and dies unless treated. Because of the inadequate energy supply, the blood glucose level is depleted, so hypoglycemia is characteristic of pregnancy toxemia. Injection of glucose is an effective treatment.\n\nPregnancy toxemia may develop in rabbits after kindling, if their feed intake is inadequate, the diet is too low in energy, or if they go off feed. Often, pregnancy toxemia is associated with the occurrence of hair balls in the stomach, which impair feed intake (Patton et al., 1983) . The relationship between fat metabolism and ketonemia (blood ketone bodies) in rabbits has been studied by Jean-Blain and Durix (1985) . Green (1937 Green ( , 1938 described pregnancy toxemia symptoms, including fatty liver, an enlarged, extended gallbladder, and excretion of ketones in the urine.\n\nNutritional status influences a number of other pathological states besides those described above. Abortions, resorbed fetuses, and small, weak litters at birth, with a high mortality of kits during the first week of life, are common problems. Dietary inadequacy is a basic cause. Any severe type of stress, includ ing nutritional stress, can result in the doe terminating pregnancy. This has survival value in the wild. For continuation of the species, survival of the adult is more important than that of a particular litter. If there is a low energy intake, reflecting a poor feed supply, it is of survival value for the female to cease reproduction, and resume it when conditions improve and survival of the young is more likely. This is accomplished, apparently by a neurohormonal involve ment, by either resorbing the fetuses, generally before day 20 of gestation, or aborting them. Thus resorption-abortion can be linked to inadequate nutrition involving virtually any nutrient. Cheeke et al. (1984) found that excess vitamin A (see Chapter 9) can result in these symptoms, as can vitamin A deficiency. Probably deficiencies and toxicities of other nutrients can exert similar effects. Hydrocephalus, as previously described, is also a symptom of either vitamin A deficiency or toxicity.\n\nAn important problem in rabbits is fur chewing (fur pulling, fur eating). Sometimes rabbits will pull fur out of the hair coat of other rabbits in the same cage or in an adjacent cage. Besides being unsightly, it diminishes the value of the skin, and results in a reduced price obtained for meat rabbits. Fur chewing may result in hair balls (trichobezoars) forming in the stomach. These indigesti ble masses of hair may plug the pyloric sphincter, so food cannot move through the stomach. The animal goes off feed, loses weight, and eventually dies. It occurs frequently in does, perhaps associated with the normal hair pulling to make the nest. It is particularly important in Angora rabbits, in which \"wool block\" is a major problem. The feeding of a high-fiber diet, and particularly the feeding of long hay, greens, or other roughage may help to \"sweep\" hair out of the stomach before it can form a trichobezoar.\n\nFur balls can be treated by the administration of a source of proteolytic en zymes, such as bromelain and papain. These are protein-digesting enzymes found in pineapples and papaya, respectively. Oral dosing with about 10 ml of raw pineapple juice, given several times daily, will usually cause a hair ball to disintegrate and pass through the stomach. After feed intake resumes, the feeding of long hay will help to remove any remaining hair.\n\nNutritional status is related to respiratory disease, primarily through effects on the environment. Most respiratory disease in rabbits is caused by infection with Pasteurella multocida. This bacterial organism colonizes the nasal passages, leading to respiratory distress and ultimately pneumonia and breakdown of the lungs. A principal factor involved in Pasteurella infection is the presence of high ammonia levels and high humidity in the rabbitry. Water vapor in the air dis solves ammonia, and it attacks the mucous membranes of the nasal passages when the rabbit breathes. This destroys the normal resistance of the mucosa to bacterial infection, and allows the Pasteurella organisms to invade. Adequate ventilation is necessary to reduce both humidity and ammonia concentrations. The source of the ammonia is urea excreted in the urine. Bacteria in the manure convert the urea to ammonia, a volatile substance that is released into the air of the rabbitry. The ultimate source of the ammonia is the protein in the diet. Excess protein (amino acids) is metabolized in the liver, and the nitrogen is converted to urea. Urea is filtered out of the blood by the kidney, and excreted in the urine. Ammonia in the rabbitry can be controlled in part by ensuring that excess protein or protein with an imbalance of amino acids is not fed.\n\nBoth Patton et al. (1980) and (Morisse, 1979) have noted that it is quite difficult to infect rabbits with Pasteurella unless there is ammonia in the air. In a low-ammonia environment, millions of Pasteurella organisms can be sprayed into the nasal passages with no infection resulting. With high concentrations of ammonia, colonization readily occurs.\n\nThe main nutritional involvement in pasteurellosis is the relationship between high dietary protein and air ammonia levels in the rabbitry. A vitamin A deficien cy would be expected to increase the susceptibility of the nasal epithelial tissue to infection, but, as discussed in Chapter 9, vitamin A deficiency in rabbits is unlikely under practical conditions if good quality alfalfa meal is used in the diet."}
