{"title": "Enrichment of coronavirus-induced interferon-producing blood leukocytes increases the interferon yield per cell: a study with pig leukocytes", "body": "Rex Immunol. 1993, 144, [111] [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] [117] [118] [119] [120] Enrichment of coronavirus-induced interferon-producing blood leukocytes increases the interferon yield per cell:\n\na study with pig leukocytes IFNa-producing cells (IPC), which are present at a low frequency in the blood, could be enriched up to 1 OO-fold by sequential depletion of plastic-adherent cells and cell fractionation on metrizamide density gradients. IPC were present in the non-adherent low-density cell subpopulation.\n\nCell selection experiments using antibody (Ab)-coated immunomagnetic beads revealed that porcine IPC could be positively selected by anti-CD4 or -SLA-class-11 Ab, but not by anti-CD2 or -CD8 Ab. The estimated IFN yield per IPC was found to increase when IPC were assayed at higher concentrations. These data suggest that IPC represent a unique and distinct cell population in the blood, which could secrete higher amounts of IFN following its accumulation at a site of viral infection.\n\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from several mammalian species are capable of secreting interferon-a (IFNa) in vitro following brief exposure to non-infectious viral structures, such as inactivated virus particles or glutaraldehyde-fixed virus-infected cell monolayers (Lebon et al., 1982; Capobianchi et al., 1985; Kurane et al., 1986) . These findings suggest that this IFNa-induction mechanism does not require viral replication in IFNa-producing leukocytes, but rather, may be the consequence of membrane interactions between IFNa producer cells and viral proteins present at the surface of virus particles or virus-infected cells. Indeed, several reports indicate that glycosylated viral proteins may be the essential triggers for IFNa induction (Ito et al., 1978; Lebon, 1985; Charley et al., 1991; Laude et al., 1992; Capobianchi et al., 1992) . Cells which produce IFNa in response to non-infectious viral structures (IPC, or IFNa-Submitted December 12, 1992 , accepted January 19, 1993 (*) Corresponding author.\n\nproducing cells ; also referred to as natural IFNaproducing cells (Ito et al., 1981) ), though very infrequent among PBMC, are highly efficient producers of IFNa (Gob1 et al., 1988) . IPC, which circulate throughout the body and secrete high amounts of IFN without being infected by the inducer virus, are likely to play a major role in early non-specific antiviral host defences.\n\nAlthough the precise nature of IPC is not fully elucidated, it has been shown that human IPC are non-phagocytic null cells, lacking the cell surface markers specific of B, T or NK cells or monocytes, but expressing MHC class II molecules and low levels of CD4 antigens (reviewed in Charley and Laude, 1992) . Identification of the cells responsible for producing IFNa was recently carried out using several technical approaches: cells containing mRNA for IFNa were identified by RNA-RNA in situ hybridization (Gob1 et al., 1988) , whereas immunocytochemistry with monoclonal or polyclonal anti-IFNa antibodies detected cells containing cytoplasmic IFNa (Sandberg et al., 1989; Feldman and Fitzgerald-Bocarsly, 1990) . A filter immunoplaque assay (ELISPOT) was also used to visualize IFNa-secreting cells (Cederblad and Alm, 1990) . Assuming that most IPC were detected by such techniques, and that the different IFN subtypes present in the supernatants of induced leukocytes were produced by the same cells, it was suggested that the yield of IFN per IPC could be estimated from the amount of IFN in supernatants and the IPC number per culture. Thus, herpes simplex virus(HSV)-induced human IPC were found to secrete between 0.5 and 2 units of IFNa per cell (Cederblad and Alm, 1990) . In order to analyse in more detail the nature of human IPC, several approaches were used to select these cells, including separation on density gradients, sequential cell depletion or flow CMV = cytomegalovirus. CSF = colony-stimulating factor. cytometry cell sorting with anti-leukocyte monoclonal antibodies (mAb) (Fitzgerald-Bocarsly et al., 1988; Sandberg et al., 1990) . IPC which responded to HSV-or to cytomegalovirus (CMV)-infected cells were recovered in the low density fraction of metrizamide gradients, but were found to be functionally distinct from dendritic cells (Chehimi et al., 1989) .\n\nIn previous studies, we have shown that porcine PBMC can secrete IFNa following exposure to non-infectious transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (Charley and Laude, 1988) , an enteropathogenic coronavirus which induces high IFN production in infected animals (La Bonnardiere and Laude, 1981) . In the present report, we have enriched TGEV-induced IPC by using cell depletion or cell-sorting procedures with specific mAb or by cell fractionation on discontinuous density gradients. The IPC were monitored by ELISPOT assay for secreted IFNa, and by IFN bioassay in culture supernatants. From these data, the IFN yield per IPC was estimated in the different cell fractions obtained and was found to vary with the degree of IPC enrichment. MATERIALS AND METHODS PBMC Porcine PBMC were obtained from heparinized blood by Ficoll density centrifugation on \"MSL\" (density 1.077, Eurobio, Paris). PBMC were suspended in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10 % foetal calf serum (FCS) and antibiotics. Porcine PBMC were then used directly in IFN induction or were depleted of plastic-adherent cells as follows : PBMC were resuspended in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 20 % FCS at a concentration of 2-5 x lo6 cells/ml and incubated for 90 min at 37\u00b0C in tissue culture flasks. \"Plastic-non-adherent cells\" were then collected by shaking the flasks. experiments, phagocytic cells were depleted by car-bony1 iron ingestion before Ficoll density centrifugation (Charley and Lavenant, 1990 ).\n\nAnti-porcine leukocyte mAb (Lunney and Pescovitz, 1987) mAb MSA4 (anti-CD2), 76-7-4 (anti-B), 74-12-4 (anti-CD4), 74-22-15 (anti-macrophages-granulocytes) and MSA3 (anti-SLA-class-II) were kindly provided by J. Lunney (USDA, Beltsville, MD, USA): mAb 295/33 (anti-CD8) was kindly provided by U. Koszinowski (Tiibingen, FRG). mAb TH22A5 (anti-SLA-class-II) was purchased from VMRD (Pullman, WA, USA). These antibodies were used as ascitic fluids.\n\nCells were incubated for 30 min with mAb and complement at 37\u00b0C as described previously (Charley and Lavenant, 1990 ): briefly, one-month-old rabbit serum served as a source of complement at a final dilution of l/9 and mAb were used at l/200. The percentage of dead cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion and cells were readjusted to the final viable cell concentration before use.\n\nSeparation of plastic-non-adherent cells on Per-co11 gradients was performed as described by Fitzgerald-Bocarsly et al. (1988) : Percoll (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) was adjusted to 302 mOs/kg H,O by the addition of 10 x concentrated PBS and five concentrations of Percoll in RPM1 10 % FCS (40 %, 45 %, 50 %, 55 % and 60 Ore) were layered in 15-ml conical tubes ; 12-17 x 10' cells were layered onto gradients which were centrifuged at 550 g for 60 min. Cells from interfaces and pellet were collected, washed and stored overnight at 4\u00b0C before induction.\n\nSeparation of non-adherent cells on metrizamide gradients was performed as described by Knight et al. (1986) : four concentrations of metrizamide (Sigma, St Louis, USA) in RPM1 20 % FCS (14.2 %, 15 %, 16 % and 17 070) were layered in 15-ml conical tubes; plastic non-adherent cells (3 ml at 2-10 x lO'/ml in RPM1 20 % FCS) were layered on top of gradients and the tubes were centrifuged at 550 g for 60 min. Cells from the interfaces and from the pellet were collected, washed twice and stored overnight at 4\u00b0C before induction.\n\nThe immunomagnetic indirect separation technique using \"M-450 Dynabeads\" coated with sheep anti-mouse IgG Ab (ref. 1101, from DynaI, Oslo) was performed as described in instructions for use. Briefly, cells were pretreated with different anti-porcine cell subset mAb (diluted at l/100) as indicated in the results for 30 min. After washing, pretreated cells were mixed with coated Dynabeads, at a ratio of 8 beads per cell. The mixture was gently vortexed and centrifuged to obtain optimal rosette formation. Following 30 min of incubation at 4\u00b0C with agitation, rosette-forming cells (the rosette-positive cell fraction) and particles were removed with a magnet, whereas the rosette-free suspension was decanted. Both positively and negatively selected cell fractions were washed and stored at 4\u00b0C before induction.\n\nThe proportion of different leukocyte subsets and SLA-class-II* cells in the fractions prepared on metrizamide gradients was analysed by indirect immunofluorescence using the anti-porcine leukocyte mAb described above. Briefly, cells were incubated at 4\"C for 45 min with l/10 dilutions of appropriate mAb, washed and resuspended in fluoroisothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antiserum (Biosys, Compiegne, France ; l/10). After 45 tin at 4\u00b0C and 3 washes, at least 300 cells were scored under the microscope.\n\nThe high-passage Purdue-l 15 strain of TGEV was used as a virus source. The procedures for virus propagation in the pig kidney cell line PD5 and titration of infectivity in the swine testis (ST) cell line were reported previously .\n\nAfter the various separation procedures described above, cells were stored overnight at 4\u00b0C in RPM1 20 % FCS. Mononuclear cells were then induced to produce IFNa by incubation with TGEV in 96-well microplates as follows: cell preparations were incubated in duplicates at usual final concentrations of 4 x 106, 2 x lo6 and 1 x lo6 viable cells per ml (except for metrizamide-or Percoll-separated cells which were incubated at 4x 105, 2 x lo5 and 1 x 10' cells/ml), in a total volume of 200 ~1 of RPM1 10 % FCS containing 2x lo4 plaque-forming units of TGEV. After 8 h at 37\"C, the induced cells were resuspended and 100 ~1 from each well were trans-ferred to nitrocellulose-bottomed microplates for the ELISPOT assay (see below). The other 100 ~1 of induced cells were further incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C for IFN bioassay.\n\nELISPOT (solid-phase enzyme-linked immunospot) assay\n\nThe ELISPOT assay was performed as described (Cederblad and Alm, 1990) : nitrocellulose-bottomed 96-well filtration plates (ref. Mahan 4550 from Millipore, Guyancourt, France) were coated with antiporcine IFNa mAb (mAb K9, described by Lefevre et al. (1990) and L'Haridon et al. (1991) ) at a final concentration of 0.8 pg/ml in PBS. The plates were then fixed with 0.05 % glutaraldehyde and blocked with 3 070 glycine in PBS. TGEV-induced cells were added to the wells and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. Following extensive washing, the plates were then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-porcine IFNa mAb F17 (Lefevre et al., 1990 and L'Haridon et a/., 1991) at a final concentration of 2 kg/ml for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in 5 % bovine serum albumin and 0.05 070 Tween PBS. After washing, each well received 0.1 ml substrate solution consisting of diaminobenzidine with perhydrol. The plates were finally dried and spots were counted under a macroscope. The frequency of IPC was calculated as the mean number of spots divided by the total PBMC number in each well of the induction cultures.\n\nSerial log, dilutions of supernatants from induced cells were assayed for IFN on bovine MDBK cells using vesicular stomatitis virus as a challenge (La Bonnardiere and Laude, 1981) . Our internal standard porcine IFNa was included in each assay. This standard was calibrated on MDBK cells with the human international reference IFN B69/19 (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). In our results, 1 U was equiva-lent to 1 IU of human IFN. The estimated amount of IFN produced by each IPC was calculated from the titre of IFN (units) in induction culture supernatants and the IPC numbers per culture.\n\n-\n\nPorcine PBMC obtained from Ficoll HYpaque gradients are induced to produce IFN following incubation with TGEV. The IPC, as monitored by the ELISPOT assay, were found to be infrequent among PBMC (1 per 104; table I). When PBMC were depleted of plasticadherent cells and/or of phagocytic cells before viral induction, the IPC frequency was 2-to 3-fold increased in the non-adherent, nonphagocytic cell fraction (table I) . Further treatment of non-adherent cells with different antileukocyte, mAb and complement, before viral induction, showed that anti-CD4 mAb with complement almost completely depleted IPC (table II) . Similarly, IPC were positively selected by anti-CD4-coated immunomagnetic beads (table III) .\n\nIn these experiments, mAb directed to B cells, to CD2+ or CD8+ cells or to SLA-class-II+ cells did not abolish IPC in the presence of complement (table II) , nor could they positively select IPC with immunobeads (table III). The frequency of IPC was even increased following complement-mediated depletion of CD8+ cells (table II) . These data indicated, therefore, that when non-adherent cells were treated with mAb before virus induction, IFNa-secreting cells could be characterized as non-T, non-B, CD8-but CD4+ cells, partly confirming previous observations of the effects of complement-mediated cell depletion on IFN production (Charley and Lavenant, 1990 ). However, a surprising result in the present experiments was that IPC monitored by ELISPOT were mostly SLA-class-IInegative, in contrast with our previous results on IFN production by mAb-treated leukocytes (Charley and Lavenant, 1990) . Such a discrepancy might be explained by the results of the following experiments in which immunomagnetic beads/cell separations were performed either before or after virus induction : table IV shows that a much higher proportion of porcine IPC was recovered in the positively selected cell fraction when anti-CD6 or -SLA-class-II-coated beads were used after virus induction instead of before virus induction. An alternative approach to selecting IPC was to fractionate PBMC on discontinuous density gradients using Percoll or metrizamide. When plastic non-adherent cells were fractionated onto Percoll gradients, cells from the low-density fraction (45 % Percoll) corresponding to less than 15 070 non-adherent cells were lo-to 17-fold enriched for IFNa-secreting cells (table V) . IPC were much more highly enriched on metrizamide gradients : in the low-density fraction of 14.2 % metrizamide, in which 0.5-1.5 % of nonadherent cells were recovered, the IPC frequency was 20-to 130-fold increased as compared with unfractionated PBMC (range of results obtained in 11 experiments, table VI). To characterize the enriched IPC population obtained on 14.2 070 metrizamide gradients, indirect immunofluorescence tests were performed with anti-porcine leukocyte mAb. Table VII shows that low-density cell fractions were mainly enriched for TH22A5+ or MSA3 + (SLA-class-II+) cells and for 74-22-15 + cells (granulocytes/macrophages). To try to enrich IPC further, lowdensity cells isolated on 14.2 % metrizamide were also treated with different mAb: only a slight (less than 2-fold) increase in IPC frequency could be obtained when low-density cells were depleted of CD8+ cells (data not shown).\n\nThe mean amount of IFN produced by each IPC, as estimated from the amount of IFN in supernatants and the IPC number, was 3 units per IPC for PBMC incubated at 2x 106/ml (data collected from 28 experiments; table I).\n\nWhen we compared the IFN yield per IPC among PBMC induced at different cell concentrations (from 1.2 x lo5 to 4 x 106/ml), we observed that the IFN yield per IPC was not a constant value, as expected, but indeed increased with the increasing IPC concentration ( fig. 1) . When IPC were enriched in 45 % Percoll frac-tions, we also observed an increase in IFN yield (table V) . Finally, when all the data collected from cell fractionations on metrizamide (up to 11 experiments, table VI), were plotted, we found that IFN yield per IPC was more than lo-fold-increased with increasing IPC concentrations ( fig. 2 ). Results are expressed as means of 5 to 11 different experiments.\n\nNon-adherent cells were fractionated on metrizamide gradients and each fraction (14.2 'To, 15 %, 16 'To and 17 070) was tested at 1, 2 and 4x IO' cells/ml. IPC concentration and IFN yield per cell were calculated as described above for each cell preparation.\n\nOur study indicates that the frequency of the porcine PBMC secreting IFNa in response to coronavirus TGEV, as monitored by ELISPOT assay, is extremely low (1 per 104) among PBMC (table I) . This result is in agreement with other studies performed on HSV-induced human leukocytes. By several technical approaches, including limiting dilution analysis, RNA-RNA in situ hybridization, immunocytochemistry and ELISPOT assay, the frequency of human IPC in blood mononuclear cells is less than 1 per lo3 (Gob1 et Feldman and Fitzgerald-Bocarsly, 1990; Cederblad and Alm, 1990) . IPC, which circulate throughout the body and are induced to secrete IFNa following brief exposure to non-infectious viral structures (reviewed in Charley and Laude, 1992) are likely to contribute markedly to the early production of IFNu occurring in viral infections and thus deserve much attention. However, their very low frequency has greatly hampered their study. In the present report, we have analysed the effects of various cell fractionation procedures to enrich for coronavirus-induced porcine IPC. Depletion of plastic-adherent and phagocytic cells resulted in a 3-fold IPC increase (table I) , which indicates that, in contrast to the results of Gob1 et al. (1988) demonstrating that monocytes are potent producers of IFNcr in response to Sendai virus, TGEV-induced IFNu-secreting cells are non-adherent and non-phagocytic cells.\n\nSpecific cell fractionation experiments were then performed with anti-leukocyte mAb by complement-dependent lysis or by immunomagnetic bead selection. IPC frequency was greatly reduced following depletion of CD4+ cells performed before virus induction, whereas complement-mediated lysis of CD8+ cells slightly increased the IPC frequency. Fractionations of non-adherent cells by anti-SLA-class-II, anti-B or anti-CD2 mAb before virus induction did not affect IPC frequency (tables II and III). In contrast, when the immunomagnetic bead selection was performed after virus induction, IPC were positively selected by anti-CD4 as well as by anti-class-II mAb-coated beads (table IV) .\n\nThese data indicate clearly that TGEVinduced IFNa-secreting cells, as monitored by ELISPOT, are characterized as non-adherent, non-phagocytic, non-T, non-B cells, expressing CD4 and SLA-class-11 molecules, with the latter cell marker expressed by IPC following virus induction.\n\nIn fact, virus-induced SLA-class-11 expression on IPC could be the consequence of the effect of IFNa secreted by these cells. Such a cell phenotype is in agreement with the results obtained on HSV-induced human IPC (Sandberg et al., 1989 ; Feldman and Fitzgerald-Bocarsly , 1990 ; Sandberg et al., 1990 ; reviewed in Charley and Laude, 1992) , which suggests that a similar and distinct cell population is responsible for IFNa production in several animal species following induction by different RNA or DNA viruses. Cell fractionations with mAb resulted in only a slight IPC enrichment : at the most, IPC were 4-fold-enriched by positive selection with anti-CD4 mAb-coated beads (exp. no 2 in table IV). In contrast, cell fractionations on discontinuous density gradients allowed a much higher enrichment of IPC : in the low-density fractions from Percoll gradients and from metrizamide gradients (tables V and VI), IPC were lo-30-fold enriched. The 14.2 % metrizamide fraction, which contained less than 1.5 % non-adherent cells, in some experiments contained IPC at a frequency up to 120 times higher than the starting cell population. This low-density cell population was mainly enriched in SLA-class-II+ cells, in T cells and in cells reacting with a mAb specific for granulocytes and macrophages (table VII). In the human species, HSV-or CMV-induced IPC fractionated in a low-density cell population, enriched in HLA-DR+ cells, but which appeared to be functionally distinct from dendritic cells (Feldman and Fitzgerald-Bocarsly, 1990 ; Chehimi et al., 1989) .\n\nDuring the different cell fractionation procedures used in the present study to enrich in IPC, we observed that the estimated IFN yield per IPC was not a constant value for a given animal, as expected, but instead could vary with the IPC concentration. Thus, when non-adherent cells were incubated with TGEV at different cell concentrations, the IFN yield per cell increased with the IPC concentration ( fig. 1) . A similar observation was made when IPC were gradually enriched on density gradients (table V, fig. 2 ). The IFN yield per IPC was, in some experiments, 10 times higher after IPC enrichment ( fig. 2) .\n\nSeveral mechanisms could account for increased IFN secretion by each IPC: accessory factors which enhance the IFNa response of IPC, such as IFNy, IFNa, IL3 or GM-CSF (Cederblad and Alm, 1991) , might be more highly produced in the cell fractions in which IPC were enriched. In fact, we could not detect IFNy in the supernatants of TGEV-induced low-density cells (data not shown). Also, preliminary colonystimulating factor (CSF) assays performed on porcine bone marrow semi-solid cultures indicated that there was no higher CSF activity in the supernatants of low-density cells (F. Hervatin, personal communication). It remains possible, therefore, that the increased IFN yield per IPC observed is a consequence of an enhancing, so called \"priming\", effect of IFNa upon its own production (Stewart ef al., 1971) . Another possible explanation could be that cells having inhibitory influences on IFNa secretion were lost during the cells fractionation procedures.\n\nThe presently observed phenomenon may well have in vivo relevance during viral infections: thus, recruitment of inflammatory cells around initial sites of viral infection could locally increase the IPC concentration, thereby enhancing their capacity to secrete high amounts of IFNa, which could contribute to limiting the spread of virus infection. providing blood samples and A.M.
