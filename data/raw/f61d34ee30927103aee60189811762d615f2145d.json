{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Could Sars-coronavirus-2 trigger autoimmune and/or autoinflammatory mechanisms in genetically predisposed subjects?", "body": "We have read with interest the recent article by Favalli et al published in Autoimmunity Reviews [1] . We agree with the Authors that Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is unquestionably conditioning therapeutic strategies of autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Indeed, RA patients show increased infectious risk because of impairment of immune system and immunosuppressive related-therapy. The Authors also suggest that the increasing knowledge about the pathophysiology of Sars-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is leading to consider cs-, b-and tsDMARDs as potential therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 [1] .\n\nThis point is of valuable interest for Rheumatologist and Immunologists cause among the most important mechanisms underlying COVID-19, it has been reported cytokine release storm leading to interstitial pulmonary inflammation, extensive lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome [2, 3] .\n\nIn particular, in a recent study by Qin C, et al.in which among 452 patients with COVID-19, most of them had increase of several inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1and IL-6 [3] .\n\nFurther, higher serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e. TNF-\u03b1, IL-1 and IL-6) were found in patients with severe COVID-19 as compared to the non-severe ones [3] . Additionally, in severe cases, a reduction of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and a decrease of regulatory T cells has been found, likely due to high expression of proinflammatory cytokines in COVID-19 patients [3] ."}
