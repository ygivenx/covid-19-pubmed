{"title": "Structural Insights into 5' Flap DNA Unwinding and Incision by the Human FAN1 Dimer", "body": "FAN1 possesses 5' flap endonuclease and 5'-3' exonuclease activities and is involved in a DNA ICL damage repair pathway [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . FAN1 is thought to be recruited to ICLs via its interaction with the monoubiquitinated form of the FANCI-FANCD2 complex, and, accordingly, disruption of the nuclease activity of FAN1 sensitizes cells to ICL inducing agents [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . In ICL repair, FAN1 is thought to co-operate with other nucleases to introduce DNA incisions necessary for the efficient unhooking of the ICL 1-6 . Interestingly, FAN1 inactivation can lead to chronic kidney diseases 7 and autism/schizophrenia 8 , linking defective DNA lesion repair with aging 9 and neurological disorders 8 . Besides its positive role in genome maintenance, FAN1 is also implicated in conferring chemo-resistance in Users may view, print, copy, and download text and data-mine the content in such documents, for the purposes of academic research, subject always to the full Conditions of use:http://www.nature.com/authors/editorial_policies/license.html#terms several cancer subtypes 10, 11 , presenting itself as a promising drug target against chemotherapy-resistance.\n\nAlthough the structures of viral/bacterial homologues of the FAN1 nuclease domain, VRR_NUC, are available 12 , neither the DNA-interaction mechanism nor the exact role of human FAN1 in the ICL repair reaction is clear. Here we report three crystal structures of human FAN1 bound to 5' flap DNA and provide biochemical data to elucidate FAN1-DNA substrate interplay. We show that FAN1 forms an asymmetrical dimer to engage the DNA lesion, unwind the flap, and incise the unwound DNA intermediate. These results illustrate a highly unusual mode of DNA substrate engagement by FAN1 and provide insights into the critical role of FAN1 in ICL repair and in the prevention of functional decline in different organs. Moreover, our results should facilitate efforts directed at counteracting FAN1mediated chemotherapy resistance in cancer treatment.\n\nA stable fragment 5 of FAN1 containing residues 373 to 1017 (FAN1 373-1017 ) was used for structural studies, as it covers all the essential domains for DNA processing and preserves near wild-type nuclease activity 5 . For crystallization, a DNA substrate with a one-nucleotide (1-nt) 5' flap flanked by two duplex regions of 10 bp, designated as 5'-flap (10-1-10) , was mixed with FAN1 373-1017 carrying an active-site mutation 2 D960A to prevent DNA cleavage. The duplex regions contained 1-nt (A or T) overhangs to facilitate crystallization (sequences in Supplementary Table 1 ). Three different crystal forms of FAN1 373-1017 in complex with the 5' flap DNA were obtained and they diffracted to resolutions of 2.2 \u00c5 (space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 ), 3.8 \u00c5 (P3 1 ), and 4.2 \u00c5 (P3 1 ), respectively. The structures were solved by the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) method using signals from iodide ions, which were included in the crystallization buffer for the P2 1 2 1 2 1 crystal form, and subsequently by the molecular replacement method for the P3 1 crystals (Table 1) . All three structures were refined to good statistics with excellent geometry (Table 1) . Unambiguous electron density in the three crystal forms clearly reveals three distinct DNA conformations in the cleft formed by two FAN1 molecules ( Fig. 1a -d and Supplementary  Fig. 1 ).\n\nThe FAN1 373-1017 molecule has three domains (Fig. 1e) : a SAP containing domain as the primary DNA-binding domain, a TPR domain mediating inter-domain interaction and part of the dimerization interface, and a VRR_NUC domain that harbours the catalytic site. The SAP domain consists of a canonical SAP fold and a SAP' region that connects to the TPR domain. The VRR_NUC domain has similar fold and active site residues as the Achaea Holliday Junction resolvase HJC 13 , with a C\u03b1 root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 2.2 \u00c5 (Fig. 1f, g) . This indicates a similar mechanism of metal-mediated catalysis, even though no metal ion is present here due to the mutation of the metal-coordinating residue D960A. A comparison with the HJC structure suggests that the DNA substrate is oriented at the active site by residues K977/H832 (K48/R25 in HJC) for hydrolysis mediated by residues E815/ E834/D960/E975 (E9/S29/D33/E46 in HJC) (Fig. 1g) . Consistent with the published data 2, 3, 5, 6, 14, 15 , wild-type FAN1 373-1017 exhibits strong endonuclease activity on 5' flap DNA substrates, generating two endonuclease products at the 4 th nt into the duplex region 3' to the branch site and at the 7 th nt into the single strand (ss) region 5' to the branch site ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). It also exhibits exonuclease activity on 5' flap, 3' flap, and doublestranded (ds) DNA substrates ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ).\n\nTwo FAN1 molecules act together to recognize the DNA substrate. FAN1 alone is monomeric in solution 12 ; however, DNA binding promotes FAN1 dimerization in solution (Supplementary Figs. 3d, 8) . Consistently, our crystal structures reveal DNA-induced assembly of a \"head to tail\" FAN1 dimer via the TPR and NUC domains of the first FAN1 molecule interacting with the SAP domain of a second FAN1 (Fig. 1a-c) . FAN1 dimer-DNA interactions are observed in all three crystals, each with a distinct DNA-binding form (Fig.  1a -c). These include: (i) a \"substrate-scanning form\" (P2 1 2 1 2 1 crystal) wherein the DNA contacts one of the FAN1 molecules in the dimer (Fig. 1a) , (ii) a \"substrate-latching form\" (P3 1 crystal 1) wherein the DNA becomes engaged with both FAN1 molecules (Fig. 1b) , and (iii) a substrate \"unwinding-form\" (P3 1 crystal 2) where the DNA interacts extensively with both FAN1 molecules and the flap-containing strand is unwound and points toward the active site (Fig. 1c, 2a) . Within the asymmetric dimer, one FAN1 molecule (denoted as P FAN1) appears to play a primary role in catalysis by engaging the DNA in its active site and the other FAN1 molecule (denoted as A FAN1) plays an auxiliary role, facilitating substrate orientation and flap unwinding. P FAN1 and A FAN1 in all crystal forms are structurally similar, with the C\u03b1 RMSD of 0.8 ~ 1 \u00c5. Interestingly, an asymmetric arrangement of two MRE11 molecules has been observed in the structure of the MRE11-DNA complex 16 that functions in DNA double-strand break repair and signalling pathways, suggesting a similar strategy is employed for both enzymes to engage the DNA substrate and to prepare it for endonucleolytic incision.\n\nA conserved dimerization mode with some degree of variation is observed in the three FAN1-DNA structures, with the \u03b1 9 , \u03b1 7 and \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 region of the A SAP domain lodging onto the surface in-between P VRR_NUC and P TPR ( Fig. 2a-b) . The helix \u03b1 9 seems to serve as a central core interaction module, while \u03b1 7 and \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 adjust their positions and orientations to adapt to different dimer orientations ( Fig. 2c-e) . These interactions are mostly electrostatic in nature, including extensive hydrogen bonds and salt bridges between the two FAN1 molecules. Notably, a more extensive interface is seen in the \"unwinding form\" wherein the two FAN1 molecules associate more tightly to unwind the 5' flap DNA. We carried out mutagenesis to validate the observed dimer interface (Fig. 2f -h and Supplementary Fig. 2e , 3) . As predicted from the dimer structure, a triple mutation K525E/R526E/K528E on the core \u03b1 9 interface greatly diminished DNA induced dimerization as revealed by protein crosslinking using the chemical reagent BMH (bis(maleimido)hexane) (Fig. 2f) , sizeexclusion chromatography (SEC, Supplementary Fig. 3e) , and SEC-multi angle lase light scattering (SEC-MALLS, Fig. 2i ). As a consequence, the substrate-binding affinity to 5' flap DNA (Fig. 2g ) and endonuclease activity (Fig. 2h) were substantially reduced by this mutation. Surprisingly, the mutant exhibited similar dsDNA exonuclease activity as that of the wild type enzyme ( Supplementary Fig. 4) , suggesting that DNA induced dimerization endows FAN1 with 5' flap-structure specific endonuclease activity, while the exonuclease activity may not require dimerization. Interestingly, the mutation R982E on the PVRR NUC side of the interface had no effect on DNA-induced FAN1 dimerization (Fig. 2f ) and 5' flap DNA-binding capacity (Fig. 2g ), but showed a slightly different binding pattern with 5' flap DNA (Fig. 2g) . It almost completely ablated both endonuclease and exonuclease activities ( Fig. 2h and Supplementary Fig. 4 ). This indicates that R982E may perturb the dimerization conformation leading to catalytically unproductive DNA-binding.\n\nThe DNA interaction modules of the FAN1 dimer tether and orient the duplex regions of the 5' flap DNA substrate (Fig. 3a -c) prior to unwinding and incision. The P SAP surface facing the catalytic site constitutes the major DNA-binding site that recognizes the sugar-phosphate backbone of the duplex region downstream of the 5' flap (denoted as P Duplex). This surface is the most positively charged and conserved region of FAN1 ( Fig. 3a and Supplementary  Fig. 6a ). The binding is achieved through extensive electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding interactions (Fig. 3b ). This P SAP-DNA interaction locates the 5' flap site at the tip of the P SAP domain (Fig. 1a -c and 3b). Interestingly, the DNA in the \"substrate-scanning\" form is in a reversed orientation and consequently directs the 5' flap away from the VRR_NUC active site (Fig. 1a ). This suggests that DNA may bind in both orientations but only the correct one can lead to substrate latching and unwinding for subsequent incision.\n\nTo validate the role of the P Duplex-binding residues on FAN1, we created the following compound mutants: . As a control, a compound mutation, R636E/R640E/K642E, distant from the DNA binding and dimerization interfaces had no effect on DNA-binding capacity or nuclease activity (Fig. 3a , e, f). Besides the electrostatic interactions, residues Y374 and Y436 also form two hydrogen bonds with the phosphate backbone of DNA. To validate their functional relevance, we further tested the Y374F/Y436F mutation and the results showed that it retained WT-like 5' flap DNA-binding affinity but was substantially impaired in endonuclease activity (Fig. 3e , f). This indicates that the two residues (Y374 and Y436) may contribute to appropriate substrate-orientation through hydrogen-bonding interactions.\n\nIn addition to the P SAP-P Duplex interaction, A SAP can bind the duplex region upstream of the 5' flap (denoted as the A Duplex), facilitating the latching and orientation of the DNA (Fig. 1b, c and Fig. 3c ). This interaction presumably also facilitates DNA-induced FAN1 dimerization. Specifically, A K401 of helix \u03b1 3 in A SAP engages the A Duplex in the \"substrate-latching\" form, and a subsequent ~7\u00c5 translocation of \u03b1 3 in the \"substrateunwinding\" form generates a tighter contact with the A Duplex through additional contacts involving residues A K409 and A Q406 (Fig. 3c) . Consistent with the structural observation, the triple mutant K401E/K406E/Q409E of FAN1 showed substantially impaired 5'flap DNA-binding affinity and endonuclease activity ( Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 5 ).\n\nThe dimerization of FAN1 further creates an interface that facilitates the unwinding of the DNA duplex and guides the liberated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) toward the active site ( Fig. 3d) . The observed \"unwinding-form\" likely represents a state with partially unwound DNA substrate, as the ssDNA region does not reach the active site for hydrolysis. Further unwinding toward the active site is needed to enable the incision at the previously reported incision point 4 nt downstream of the flap 3 . In the current crystal form, the side chains of A N452 from \u03b1 3 and A S460 from \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 and the backbone carbonyl of P P979 provide three hydrogen bonds to the backbone of the ssDNA, while P L811 forms stacking interaction with a ribose ring. The compound mutation N452D/S460D/L811D led to substantially impaired nuclease activity (Fig. 3f) while preserving near-wild type binding affinity to 5' flap DNA (Fig. 3e) . This is consistent with the important role of these residues in guiding the ssDNA region to the active site in P VRR_NUC. The energy needed to unwind the duplex region may be generated by the extra interface of both the A FAN1-DNA interaction and the FAN1 dimerization (additional area of 1200 \u00c5 2 ) as a result of the change from the \"latching-form\" to the \"unwinding-form\".\n\nTo further examine the requirement of flap unwinding in incision and to directly assess FAN1's capacity of ICL unhooking, we designed a series of DNA substrates with a single ICL created by the chemical crosslinker psoralen at various positions relative to the flap. A single ICL at the branch point will prevent the unwinding of the duplex downstream of the 5' flap, and it also abrogated FAN1 endonuclease cleavage (Fig. 4a ). To determine how many base pairs must be unwound to allow FAN1 cleavage, the ICL was moved 2, 6, 12 or 16 base pairs away from the flap branch point. Strong inhibition of endonucleolytic incision was observed until the ICL was 6-12 base pairs or further away from the flap site (Fig. 4b) , which is consistent with the flap unwinding observed in our \"substrate-unwinding\" structure.\n\nThe current model for ICL repair posits that the replication forks converge onto the ICL, producing an ICL flanked by two DNA flaps (3' and 5') that must be unhooked by two incisions, one at the base of each flap 17, 18 . SLX1, another 5' flap endonuclease, and FAN1 are thought to play overlapping roles in 5' flap processing during ICL repair 4, 18, 19 . However, while SLX1 cuts the ssDNA flap at the branch point 20 , FAN1 can create incisions both on the ssDNA flap and within the duplex region downstream ( Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2) 3, 12 . This could be explained by the unwinding of duplex DNA followed by incision of the unwound ssDNA (Fig. 4a) , as suggested by our structural and biochemical data. FAN1 would mediate DNA incision further away from the ICL (Fig. 4c) . The involvement of FAN1 and SLX1 in ICL repair would expand the repair spectrum and properly incise various DNA structures or at different steps of ICL repair. SLX1 has been proposed to play a prominent role in ICL unhooking 18 , while FAN1 may be more involved in the homologous recombination reaction during ICL repair 1, 18, 21 .\n\nThe active site and the P Duplex interfaces of FAN1 are evolutionarily conserved from bacteria to humans, while the protein dimerization, DNA flap binding, and A Duplex interfaces appear to be unique to higher eukaryotic species (Supplementary Fig. 6 and 7) . In particular, the core \u03b1 9 helix (bearing residues K525, R526 and K528), essential for dimerization and nuclease activity in human FAN1, are substantially shorter or absent in lower species (Supplementary Fig. 6b, c and 7) . This suggests that bacterial FAN1 orthologs may use a different mechanism for DNA binding without protein dimerization. This difference may be due to the fact that eukaryotic FAN1 has evolved to work with other cellular factors, as it is recruited to ICL sites via the monoubiquitinated FANCI/D2 complex [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Moreover, the FANCI/D2 complex has been shown to interact with branched DNA mainly on the exposed positively charged surface of the protein complex 22 . Our structures reveal that human FAN1 also engages DNA in a relatively open conformation that would allow access by other binding partners. This lends support to the potential simultaneous and collaborative binding of FAN1 and FANCI/D2 to a stalled replication fork during its repair, as proposed previously [2] [3] [4] . The FANCI/D2-dependent ICL repair pathway is absent in bacteria, and different catalytic properties for bacterial and human FAN1 have indeed been reported recently 12 . FAN1 mutations 7, 8 have been implicated in aging and developmental disorders including chronic kidney disease 7 and mental ailments 8 . In this regard, FAN1 could help ensure organ health by minimizing the harmful effects of genotoxins to which the kidney is exposed and of potential ICL inducers in embryonic neural tissues during the period of rapid genome replication 24 . The elucidation of the human FAN1-DNA structure allows us to assess the existing disease-associated FAN1 variants 7, 8 via structural mapping (Fig. 4d) . Mutations of active site residues (D960 1, 2, 7 , K977 2, 23 , D981 3 , R982 3 , and E975 23 ) are expected to abrogate the nuclease activity, while mutations of residues located in the interior of FAN1 (G937 7 , Q929 7 , P867 8 , P654 8 , R658 7 and C871 7 ) could affect protein folding and thus disrupt the structural integrity of FAN1. Moreover, mutations of residues located on the protein dimerization (L477 5 , E437 8 and R982 3 ) and DNA binding (E437 8 , L395 8 , R706 8 and L477 5 ) interfaces likely perturb the dimer structure and impair the DNA-binding activity of FAN1. FAN1 expression has been found to correlate with treatment outcome in breast and ovarian cancers, with increased FAN1 expression leading to a poorer prognosis 11 . On the other hand, suppressed FAN1 recruitment to DNA lesions may account for the enhanced response to ICL-inducing chemotherapy drugs in lung cancer 10 . In these regards, FAN1 is a promising target for improving chemotherapy efficacy. Results from our study establish a structural and biochemical basis for understanding human disorders caused by FAN1 deficiency, and for the potential design of new anticancer treatments targeting FAN1.\n\nThe full-length human FAN1 gene was cloned into an E. coli expression vector pET43.1. Site directed mutagenesis on D960A was introduced prior to subcloning for structural studies. FAN1 373-1017 D960A was subcloned into the pMAT9s expression vector containing a N-terminal 6xHis tag followed by the maltose binding protein (MBP) and a SARS-CoV M pro cleavage site 25, 26 . The protein was expressed in the E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) by a 16-h induction with 0.1 mM isopropyl \u03b2-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 16 \u00b0C and a starting cell density of OD 600 of 0.8. The protein was purified using amylose agarose beads (GE Healthcare) and Superdex 200 size exclusion column. Homogenous fractions of FAN1 protein were collected and concentrated to 5 mg/mL in protein storage buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1M NaCl, 50% glycerol) at \u221280 \u00b0C. FAN1 mutants were generated using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), verified by DNA sequencing, expressed, and purified using the same procedure described above. Notably, all mutants used throughout the study were purified as monodispersed monomers and displayed identical chromatographic behavior, indicating the overall folding of the protein is not perturbed by any of the mutations.\n\n5' Flap DNA substrates were prepared by mixing equimolar amounts of DNA oligonucleotides (a3-10-1/b22(AT)/c10 for the \"substrate-scanning\" form and a3-10-1/b22/c10 for the \"substrate-latching\" and \"substrate-unwinding\" forms; sequences of the oligonucleotides are in Supplementary Table 1 ) were mixed in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1 mM Tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) at 95\u00b0C, followed by slow annealing from 95\u00b0C to 4\u00b0C over 16 hours. The annealed product was purified using a Superdex 200 size exclusion column, concentrated to 0.5 mM, and stored at \u221220\u00b0C.\n\nFor crystallization, the 6xHis-MBP tag was cleaved from FAN1 373-1017 D960A by the SARS-CoV M pro protease. FAN1 373-1017 (D960A)-DNA complex was obtained by mixing protein with DNA substrate at 1:1 molar ratio and purification by gel-filtration chromatography in a Superdex 200 column in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM TCEP. Complex fractions were collected, concentrated to 5 mg/ml, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\n\nThe FAN1-DNA complexes were crystallized using the macro-batch under oil method 27 at room temperature. A mixture of protein and reservoir buffer was deposited under a layer of 2:1 paraffin (Fluka):silicon (Hampton Research) oil and allowed to equilibrate at room temperature. Crystals of the \"substrate-scanning\" form were obtained in a crystallization buffer containing 210 mM potassium iodide, 100 mM Bis-Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, with 18% PEG 3350, and 2 mM spermidine. The crystals were cryo-protected using the crystallization solution containing 25% glycerol and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. Datasets were collected at NE-CAT beamline 24ID-C at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, and beamlines X29 and X25 at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory. Anomalous signals from the iodine ions were carefully collected using a low-dose shutter-less data collection strategy at the wavelength of 1.595 \u00c5 (f\"=7.3 for iodine). Five isomorphous datasets from three crystals were processed, merged, and scaled in space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 to 2.8 \u00c5 resolution using XDS 28 (Table 1) , with useful anomalous signal existing to 4\u00c5, where the Pearson correlation coefficients 29 CC 1/2 = 0.99 and CC Anom = 0.2 in the resolution shell 4.4-4.0 \u00c5.\n\nA total of 11 iodine sites were located using SHELX 30 and initial phases were determined by the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) method using Phenix 31 and SHARP 32 . Subsequent density modification in SHARP produced an excellent electron density map in which unambiguous protein and DNA features were easily discernable (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). An initial model of the FAN1 molecule and entire duplex region of the DNA substrate was built using a combination of automated model building by Buccanneer 33 and manual rebuilding in Coot 34 . A slightly non-isomorphous native dataset was subsequently collected at 0.9792 \u00c5 wavelength to a resolution of 2.2 \u00c5 by merging five datasets from three crystals. The structure was solved using the initial FAN1-DNA model by molecular replacement using Phaser 35 and refined to a final R/R free of 0.220/0.256 using Refmac 36, 37 with good Ramachandran statistics (95.3% favoured, 4.0 % allowed, 0.7 % outliers).\n\nCrystals of the \"substrate-latching\" and \"substrate-unwinding\" forms were grown in the same manner as the \"substrate-scanning\" form, but were in space group P3 1 and diffracted to modest resolutions of 4.2 \u00c5 and 3.8 \u00c5, respectively. A thorough inspection of the diffraction data revealed that both crystals were twinned, with twinning fractions ~0.4 (Table 1 ). Both the conventional twinning test, such as cumulative intensity distribution, the L test 38 , and the maximum likelihood method implemented in Phenix. Xtriage 31 clearly revealed twinning with the twining operator \"h,-h-k,-l\" (Supplementary Fig. 8 ). Each crystal form contained two FAN1 molecules and one DNA in the asymmetric unit and the structures were solved by molecular replacement in Phenix, using the FAN1 model obtained in the P2 1 2 1 2 1 crystal and ideal B-DNA models. After successful amplitude-based twin refinement in Refmac5 37 , unbiased difference electron density for the ssDNA region appeared in the \"substrate-unwinding\" form before the inclusion of the ssDNA model (Fig.  1e) . Iterative model rebuilding in Coot and refinement in Refmac5 produced the final models of R/R free =24.8%/28.3% for the \"substrate-unwinding\" form (Ramachandran statistics: 94.0% favoured,4.3 % allowed, 1.7 % outliers ), and R/R free =23.5%/28.8% for the \"substrate-latching\" form (Ramachandran statistics: 96.0% favoured, 3.0 % allowed, 1.0 % outliers).\n\nWe further calculated simulated-annealing composite-omit difference Fourier maps and the results clearly validated the different DNA conformations observed in the \"substratelatching\" and \"substrate-unwinding\" forms ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ).\n\nAll the substrates were made by annealing of a 5' 32 P-labeled oligonucleotide with the complementary unlabelled oligonucleotide(s) (sequence details in Supplementary Table 1 and 2). The oligonucleotides M34 to M46 (lengths from 34 to 46 nt) were derived from the oligonucleotide H3, and were used as radioactive markers in gel analysis to determine the endonuclease incision sites. The annealed DNA substrates were then purified by electrophoresis on a native 8% polyacrylamide gel and recovered by the crushing and soaking method.\n\nOligonucleotides (X0F, X2F, X6F, X12F and X16F, Supplementary Table 1) were 32 Plabeled at the 5' end of the strand constituting the 5' flap. Labelled oligonucleotides were annealed with the complementary partner (2 \u00b5M each, Supplementary Table 2) in annealing buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 ) to generate splayed arm structures. 412.5 \u00b5M 4'-Hydroxymethyl-4, 5', 8-trimethylpsoralen (Berry and Associates, Dexter, MI) was added to the annealed oligonucleotides, incubated at room temperature for 1 hour, and the mixture was then exposed to UVA light (1.12 J/cm 2 ) for 15 minutes to crosslink the complementary strands at the unique TpA site in each substrate. The DNA preparation was resolved in an 8% denaturing gel, whereupon the crosslinked species was excised, electroeluted and concentrated (Amicon Ultra 10000 MWCO filtration device). The crosslinked species were then annealed with the third strand (X40, Supplementary Table 1) in annealing buffer. In parallel, a substrate without any crosslink was generated by annealing oligonucleotides X0F, X0R and X40. \n\nFAN1 373-1017 wild type or mutant (20, 40, 80 , and 120 nM) was incubated with the radiolabeled 5'-flap DNA substrate (5 nM) at 37\u00b0C for 10 min in 10 \u00b5M of buffer D (30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 100 \u00b5g/ml BSA, and 15 mM KCl). The reaction mixtures were resolved in 6.5% polyacrylamide gels at 4\u00b0C in TBE buffer. Gels were dried and analysed in the PhosphorImager. Quantification data were expressed as average with stand deviations from triplicated experiments.\n\nSEC-MALLS data were collected using an Ettan LC system (GE Healthcare) with a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer E (20 mM Tris HCL, pH 8.0, 80 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM TCEP) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min \u22121 . The system was coupled on-line to an 18-angle MALLS detector and a differential refractometer (DAWN HELEOS II and Optilab rEX, Wyatt Technology). Molar mass determination was calculated with ASTRA 6.2 software.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.
