{"title": "Enhanced replication of mouse adenovirus type 1 following virus-induced degradation of protein 3 kinase R (PKR) 4 5 Running Title: MAV-1 degrades PKR during infection 6 7", "body": "Protein kinase R (PKR) plays a major role in activating host immunity during infection 25 by sensing dsRNA produced by viruses. Once activated by dsRNA, PKR phosphorylates the 26 translation factor eIF2\u03b1, halting cellular translation. Many viruses have methods of inhibiting 27 PKR activation or its downstream effects, circumventing protein synthesis shutdown. These 28 include sequestering dsRNA or producing proteins that bind to and inhibit PKR activation. Here 29 we describe our finding that in multiple cell types, PKR was depleted during mouse adenovirus 30 type 1 (MAV-1) infection. MAV-1 did not appear to be targeting PKR at a transcriptional or 31 translational level because total PKR mRNA levels and levels of PKR mRNA bound to 32 polysomes were unchanged or increased during MAV-1 infection. However, inhibiting the 33 proteasome reduced the PKR depletion seen in MAV-1-infected cells, whereas inhibiting the 34 lysosome had no effect. This suggests that proteasomal degradation alone is responsible for PKR 35 degradation during MAV-1 infection. Time course experiments indicate that the degradation 36 occurs early after infection. Infecting cells with UV-inactivated virus prevented PKR 37 degradation, whereas inhibiting viral DNA replication did not. Together these results suggest that 38 an early viral gene is responsible. Degradation of PKR is a rare mechanism to oppose PKR 39 activity, and it has only been described in six RNA viruses. To our knowledge, this is the first 40 example of a DNA virus counteracting PKR by degrading it. 41 42 Importance 43\n\nThe first line of defense in cells during viral infection is the innate immune system, which 44 is activated by different viral products. PKR is a part of this innate immune system and is 45 induced by interferon and activated by dsRNA produced by DNA and RNA viruses. PKR is such 46 discovered that the PKR -/-MEF lines used are not complete PKR knockouts (52). There are two 116 categories of PKR -/-MEFs derived from knockout mice: N-PKR -/-MEFs and C-PKR -/-MEFs 117 (52). The PKR -/-MEFs derived from mice created in the Weissmann lab (53) are designated N-118 PKR -/-MEFs, because the C-terminal fragment of PKR is still expressed and can be detected by 119 immunoblot when there is IFN induction (52). The fragment has the kinase catalytic activity of 120 PKR, but it does not bind dsRNA (52). The PKR -/-MEFs derived from mice created in the Bell 121 lab (54) are designated as C-PKR -/-MEFs, because the N-terminal fragment of PKR is still 122 expressed and can be detected by immunoblot with specific PKR antibodies (52). The fragment 123 is catalytically inactive, but it can still bind dsRNA (52). Susceptibility of these PKR -/-MEFs to 124 specific viruses may be dependent on the PKR mutation and the mechanism used by each virus 125 to circumvent PKR. 126\n\nTo determine whether PKR plays an important role during MAV-1 infection, we tested 128 the susceptibility of both PKR -/-MEF lines to MAV-1 infection. We infected wild type MEFs, 129 N-PKR -/-MEFs, and C-PKR -/-MEFs with MAV-1 at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell and collected cell 130 pellets at 48 and 72 hpi. DNA was purified from the cell pellets and analyzed for MAV-1 131\n\nTo determine whether MAV-1 affects PKR during infection, we infected several cell 139 types and analyzed PKR protein expression. We infected immortalized C57BL/6 MEFs, 140 C57BL/6 primary peritoneal macrophages, and CMT93 cells (mouse rectal carcinoma cells) with 141 MAV-1 at an MOI of 10 and collected cell lysates 24, 48, and 72 hpi. We analyzed cell lysates 142\n\nfor the presence of PKR by immunoblot using a polyclonal antibody that detects mouse PKR. 143\n\nWe probed blots with antibodies to actin as a loading control. To our surprise, in C57BL/6 144 MEFs, PKR was almost completely depleted from lysates 24 hpi and remained depleted through 145 72 hpi ( Fig. 2A and B) . PKR was also depleted compared to mock infection at 24 and 48 hpi in 146 C57BL/6 MEFs infected at MOI 2 and 5 (Fig. S1 ). We also observed depletion of PKR in other 147 cell types. In CMT93 cells, PKR was nearly undetectable at 24 hpi ( Fig. 2A) . In C57BL/6 148 primary peritoneal macrophages, PKR was decreased at 48 hpi compared to mock lysates, and 149 absent in infected lysates at 72 hpi ( Fig. 2A ). This indicates that MAV-1 causes PKR depletion 150 during infection. 151\n\nTo determine whether kinase activity of PKR is important for the depletion, we assayed 153 infection of MEFs expressing a mutant form of mouse PKR with a point mutation in the kinase 154 domain (K271R) (55). These cells, designated K271R SV40-MEFs, showed an even more rapid 155 depletion of PKR than in WT SV40-MEFs (Fig. 2C) . At 24 hpi, in K271R SV40-MEFs, 28% of 156 PKR remained, compared to 60% in the WT SV40-MEFs. The fraction remaining at 72 hpi in K271R SV40-MEFs suggests that the upper band of the PKR doublet usually seen in wild-type 161 cells is a phospho-PKR band, because only the lower band of the PKR doublet is seen in kinase-162 dead mutant K271R SV40-MEFs. The data in Fig. 2A and C thus indicate that both PKR and 163 phospho-PKR are depleted during MAV-1 infection. 164\n\nTo determine the mechanism of PKR depletion, we first assayed whether reduction in 167 PKR protein during MAV-1 infection was due to reduced PKR mRNA steady-state levels. We 168 mock-infected or infected C57BL/6 MEFs and primary peritoneal macrophages at an MOI of 10 169 and collected cell lysates at 24, 48, and 72 hpi. We synthesized cDNA from RNA purified from 170 these cell lysates and assayed for PKR mRNA by qPCR. In C57BL/6 MEFs, PKR mRNA levels 171\n\nwere similar between mock and infected lysates at 24 hpi (Fig. 3A) , a time point in which PKR 172 protein levels were already greatly depleted in the infected lysates compared to mock lysates 173 (Fig. 2) . Although PKR mRNA levels were depleted 33% at 48 hpi and 40% 72 hpi in MAV-1-174\n\ninfected lysates compared to mock lysates, this does not correlate to the 84% and 94% reduction, 175 respectively, in PKR protein levels at those time points (Fig. 2B ). In C57BL/6 primary peritoneal 176 macrophages, PKR mRNA levels in the infected lysates were 2-3 times higher than levels in 177 mock lysates at all three time points assayed (Fig. 3B) , even though PKR protein levels were 178 almost completely depleted in infected lysates at 72 hpi (Fig. 2) . This is evidence that MAV-1 is 179 not causing PKR protein depletion by reducing PKR steady-state mRNA levels during infection. 180\n\nBecause MAV-1 did not reduce PKR mRNA steady-state levels, we determined whether 185 MAV-1 causes PKR depletion by reducing translation of its mRNA. We first assayed total PKR 186 mRNA bound to ribosomes during infection. C57BL/6 MEFs were mock infected or infected at 187 an MOI of 5, and lysates were collected at 48 hpi in the presence of cycloheximide to keep the 188 mRNA bound to the ribosomes (56). Lysates were centrifuged through 25% sucrose to pellet 189 ribosomes, and RNA was purified from the pellets. The purified RNAs were used to generate 190 cDNA, which we assayed for PKR mRNA by qPCR. As a control for pelleting of ribosomes, we 191 assayed the pellets and sucrose cushion supernatants by immunoblot with antibodies to 192 ribosomal protein RPL7. We confirmed that RPL7 was only present in the pellets and not the 193 supernatants (Fig. S2 ). There was no significant difference between the amount of PKR mRNA 194 in the ribosome pellet of mock infected lysates compared to MAV-1-infected lysates (Fig. 4A) . 195 196 To confirm the results seen in total mRNA bound to ribosomes, we also centrifuged cell 197 extracts on sucrose gradients to generate polysome profiles. This enabled us to analyze levels of 198 PKR mRNA associated with actively-translating ribosomes during infection. C57BL/6 MEFs 199 were mock infected or infected at an MOI of 2, and lysates were collected at 24 hpi in the 200 presence of cycloheximide, as above. RNA content for mock and infected lysates was estimated 201 by NanoDrop spectrophotometry, and equivalent OD amounts of RNA were centrifuged on 10-202 50% sucrose gradients to sediment 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits, 80S ribosomes 203 (monosomes), and polyribosomes (polysomes). A typical polysome profile was obtained (Fig. 204 4B) . RNA was purified from fractions containing monosomes and polysomes and then used to 205 generate cDNA, which we assayed for PKR mRNA by qPCR (Fig. 4C) . As a control, GAPDH 206 mRNA was measured by qPCR, and PKR mRNA levels in each fraction were normalized to the 207 GAPDH mRNA content. When the data for percentage of PKR mRNA bound to ribosomes was 208 pooled into monosome and polysome fractions and analyzed (Fig. 4D) , 90.1% and 91.8% were 209 bound to polysomes (fractions 7-19) for mock and infected samples, respectively, compared to 210 9.9% and 8.2% bound to monosomes (fractions 1-6). We performed two additional polysome 211 gradient analyses. The pooled data from all three (Fig. 4E ) were similar to the data for Fig. 4D , 212\n\ni.e., 82.7% and 92.7% of PKR mRNA were bound to mock and infected polysomes, respectively, 213 compared to 17.3% and 7.3% bound to monosomes. Thus, PKR protein depletion during MAV-1 214 infection does not appear to stem from a decrease in PKR mRNA translation. 215\n\nWe also assayed whether PKR mRNA might have a signal that would reduce its 217 translation during MAV-1 infection. We constructed a plasmid that positioned sequence 218 corresponding to the 5' UTR of PKR mRNA upstream of a reporter nanoluciferase gene (57), 219 transfected it into C57BL/6 MEFs, then infected with MAV-1. Compared to cells transfected 220 with a control plasmid with the human \uf062-globin 5' UTR upstream of the reporter nanoluciferase, 221 there was no significant difference in luciferase activity between mock infected and infected 222 samples (Fig. S3 ). These data suggest that MAV-1 is not affecting PKR translation through 223 interaction with the 5' UTR of PKR. The data are consistent with the ribosome pellet and 224 polysome data that MAV-1 infection does not reduce PKR mRNA translation. 225 226 PKR is depleted by proteasomal degradation during MAV-1 infection. 227\n\nThere are two main proteolysis pathways in cells, proteasomal degradation and lysosomal 228 degradation (58). To determine whether MAV-1 depletes PKR by either protein degradation 229 pathway, we first assayed whether PKR is lysosomally degraded as follows. CMT93 cells were 230 mock infected or infected with MAV-1 and treated at the time of infection with the lysosome 231 inhibitors ammonium chloride or chloroquine, or water (as a control). At 24 hpi, we collected 232 lysates and analyzed them by immunoblot with antibodies to PKR. In the presence of the 233 lysosomal degradation inhibitors, PKR was depleted by 24 hpi (Fig. 5A) , indicating that 234 lysosomal degradation was not the cause of PKR depletion during MAV-1 infection. We 235 confirmed that the inhibitor treatment did block lysosomal degradation by incubating cells with 236 dye-quenched bovine serum albumin (DQ BSA) in addition to the lysosomal inhibitors. DQ BSA 237 is self-quenched until it is digested in the lysosome (59, 60), and imaging confirmed that cells 238 treated with lysosome inhibitors did not fluoresce, but cells treated with the vehicle control 239 (H 2 O) did, as expected (Fig. 5B) . 240 241 Next, we examined whether proteasomal degradation is responsible for the degradation of 242 PKR by using proteasome inhibitors MG132 and bortezomib. These inhibit proteasome activity 243 by binding to the active sites in the 20S subunit and blocking the proteolytic activity (61-63). We 244 mock infected or infected C57BL/6 MEFs with MAV-1 and treated with MG132 or bortezomib 245 in DMSO at the time of infection. At 24 hpi, we collected lysates and analyzed them by 246 immunoblot for PKR protein levels. While PKR was depleted in the control DMSO-treated 247 MAV-1-infected cells as expected, PKR protein was present in the MG132-and bortezomib-248 treated cells at levels comparable to mock infected cells ( Fig. 6A and B ). To rule out the 249 possibility that PKR was present (not depleted) because the virus infection itself was inhibited by 250 MG132 or bortezomib, we assayed viral replication of MAV-1 with MG132 and bortezomib 251 treatment by qPCR of viral DNA. Viral replication was equivalent in all three treatment groups 252 ( Fig. S4) , indicating that the treatments did not affect the ability of the virus to productively 253 infect the cells. Taken together, these data indicate that MAV-1 infection results in PKR 254 depletion by causing PKR to be degraded by the proteasome during infection. 255\n\nA signal for proteasomal degradation is the conjugation of ubiquitin to a protein (64, 65). 257\n\nWe examined whether PKR is ubiquitinated by immunoblot. We detected ubiquitination of a 258 positive control, mouse p53, which is degraded in the presence of MAV-1 proteins (66). 259\n\nHowever, even with the use of epitope-tagged ubiquitin (67) and MG132 treatment, we were 260 unable to detect PKR ubiquitination during infection (Fig. S5 ). This is consistent with an 261 inability to detect PKR ubiquitination when it is degraded during RVFV infection (32). Although 262 RVFV NSs is known to recruit an E3 ligase to PKR, the authors reported that ubiquitinated PKR 263 is undetectable. Therefore, the cellular degradation signal for PKR remains unclear. 264\n\nWe investigated when proteasomal degradation of PKR occurs. Early viral proteins are 267 expressed prior to viral DNA replication, which is then followed by late viral protein expression. 268\n\nFirst, we examined the kinetics of PKR degradation to determine whether an early or late viral 269 protein was likely responsible. We mock infected and infected CMT93 cells with MAV-1 at an 270 MOI of 10 and collected lysates every six hours for 24 hours and analyzed them by immunoblot 271 with antibodies to PKR or MAV-1 early region 1A (E1A) protein, the first viral protein made 272 during infection (68). In infected cells, PKR degradation was first detected at 12 hpi (Fig. 7A) , 273 and quantitation of five independent experiments showed that ~20% of the starting levels of PKR 274 protein remained at 24 hpi ( Fig 7B) . 275 .

After 24 hours of cycloheximide treatment, approximately 90% of the starting levels of The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

We mock 299 infected or infected CMT93 cells with MAV-1 at an MOI of 10 and treated them with cytosine 300 arabinoside (araC) at the time of infection to inhibit DNA synthesis (69, 70) . This would allow 301 the virus to infect the cell and produce early viral proteins, but would inhibit viral DNA 302 replication and prevent late protein synthesis. We collected lysates at 20 and 40 hpi and analyzed 303 them by immunoblot. We confirmed that araC treatment resulted in no late protein synthesis by 304 performing an immunoblot for late virion proteins (Fig. S8 ). In samples treated with araC, PKR 305 degradation was seen at 20 and 40 hpi ( We have demonstrated here that PKR is antiviral in MAV-1 infections of cultured cells. 312\n\nSurprisingly, MAV-1 infection of primary and established cultured cells depleted PKR. The 313 depletion was not due to reduced steady-state levels or reduced translation of PKR mRNA. 314\n\nInstead, we showed that PKR depletion is inhibited by proteasome inhibitors, implicating 315 proteasomal degradation of PKR. Several lines of evidence suggest that the degradation is due to 316 a viral early function. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

When we infected PKR -/-323 MEFs with MAV-1, viral DNA yields were 5 to 6 times higher than viral DNA yields from wild 324 type MEFs (Fig. 1) , indicating that PKR plays an antiviral role during MAV-1 infection. At 48 325 hpi, the viral DNA yield from the N-MEFs was nearly 4 times higher than the C-MEFs, but by 326 72 hpi the viral DNA yields from both types of PKR -/-MEFs were similar to each other and 327\n\nsignificantly increased compared to wild type MEFs (Fig. 1) . This difference in viral replication 328 kinetics between the two types of PKR -/-MEFs may be due to differences in expression level and 329 activity of the PKR fragments reportedly produced by them; we have not assayed PKR fragment 330 production in our cells. 331\n\nWe examined PKR protein levels during MAV-1 infection and found that PKR was 333 depleted from the cells as early as 12 hpi (Fig. 7) . Depletion was seen in a wide variety of cell 334 types, including immortalized C57BL/6 MEFs, primary C57BL/6 peritoneal macrophages, and 335 CMT93 mouse colon carcinoma cells. Once depleted, PKR protein levels never returned to mock 336 infected PKR protein levels during infection. Activation (transautophosphorylation) of PKR (6-337 9) was not required for this depletion, because kinase-dead mouse PKR was also depleted from 338 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

While PKR mRNAs in C57BL/6 MEFs were depleted 33% at 48 hpi and 40% at 72 346 hpi compared to mock lysates, this is not sufficient to explain the 84% and 94% reduction, 347 respectively, in PKR protein levels at those time points (Fig. 2B ). More likely, the reduction in 348 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/584680 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nWe considered whether reduced PKR levels were due to reduced PKR protein translation. 368\n\nThere was no change in the total amount of PKR mRNA bound to ribosomes during infection 369 compared to uninfected cells, nor was there a significant change in the amount of actively 370 translating PKR mRNA during infection (Fig. 4) . We also found that the 5' UTR of mouse PKR 371 This indicates that PKR is not degraded by lysosomal degradation during viral infection, but by 378 proteasomal degradation. Though PKR degradation was due to proteasome activity during 379 MAV-1 infection, we were unable to demonstrate PKR ubiquitination, although we did detect 380 ubiquitination of mouse p53 (Fig. S5 ). This inability to demonstrate PKR ubiquitination could be 381 explained if at any given moment there were only low levels of ubiquitinated PKR present in the 382 cell. Perhaps, increasing the time under MG132 treatment could increase the amounts of 383 ubiquitinated proteins enough so that PKR ubiquitination could be seen. However, our inability 384 to detect ubiquitinated PKR is consistent with a similar inability to identify PKR ubiquitination 385 by RVFV NSs, even though NSs is known to recruit an E3 ligase to PKR (32). Alternatively, it is 386 possible that in MAV-1 infection, PKR is degraded in a ubiquitin-independent manner, possibly 387 because of intrinsic disordered regions of PKR or binding of regulating proteins to PKR that 388 target proteins to the proteasome (74, 75). 389 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/584680 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nOur experiments indicate that MAV-1 actively depletes PKR early in infection. Ongoing 390 experiments are focused on determining the MAV-1 early protein(s) responsible for PKR 391 degradation. Two possibilities are E4 proteins, the homologs of hAd E4orf6 and E4orf3, which 392 we originally termed E4orfa/b and E4orfa/c, respectively (76). In human adenovirus, E4orf6 393 interacts with another early hAd protein, E1B 55K, to participate in an E3 ligase complex that 394 ubiquitinates and degrades p53 via proteasomal degradation (77, 78). When MAV-1 E4orf6, 395 E1B 55K, and mouse p53 are introduced by transfection into human cells, all three proteins 396 interact and mouse p53 is degraded (66). If MAV-1 E4orf6 and E1B 55K form a similar complex 397 in mouse cells, it may also degrade PKR. We have preliminary evidence that mouse p53 is 398 ubiquitinated in C57BL/6 MEFs during MAV-1 infection, which suggests that the mouse p53 399 degradation seen in human cells could be paralleled by degradation of endogenous mouse p53 400 and mouse PKR in mouse cells, mediated by MAV-1 E4orf6 and E1B 55K during infection. 401\n\nAnother hAd E4 protein, E4orf3, causes proteasomal degradation of transcriptional intermediary 402 factor 1\uf067 (79) and general transcription factor II-I (80) in a manner independent of hAd E4orf6 403 and E1B 55K. E4orf3 has SUMO E3 ligase and E4 elongase activity and induces sumoylation of 404 general transcription factor II-I, leading to its proteasome-dependent degradation (80). MAV-1 405\n\nE4orf3 may similarly have sumoylation activity that results ultimately in proteasome-dependent 406 PKR degradation. Another possibility of a viral protein involved in PKR degradation is the 407 protease encoded by MAV-1. The hAd protease is encapsidated in virions and proteolytically 408 processes viral proteins IIIa, VI, VII, VIII, mu, and TP (81-84). However, we think it is unlikely 409 that the MAV-1 protease degrades PKR, because we showed that UV-inactivated virus was 410 unable to degrade PKR. We assume that UV treatment would not destroy the MAV-1 protease 411 .
