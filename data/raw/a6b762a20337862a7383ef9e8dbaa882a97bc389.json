On January 30, 2020, the epidemic was recognized as a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization, and was officially declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The increasing number of cases and deaths poses a major global public health challenge 1 and has already brought a heavy burden to the economy of the world. 2 By February 28, 2020, a total of 78,959 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus infection had been reported in China with an overall mortality rate of 3.53% (2,791 cases). 3 Of these, 13,052 cases were reported outside Hubei province, with an overall mortality rate of 0.85% (111 cases). The reasons for the reduced mortality outside Hubei province are unknown, however it is possible the causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), loses pathogenicity due to passage, it is possible primary care is now more appropriate than during the early stages of the outbreak and it is also possible that screening for diagnosis and management is more appropriate. 4 During the outbreak in Sichuan province, we developed and implemented a hospital-specific systematic process for screening, isolating and managing suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients. The purpose of this paper is to report the effectiveness of this process. All rights reserved.

The first level of fever triage occurred at the main entrance of the emergency department and outpatient building.\n\nThe second level occurred at the nurse triage station in each clinic, and the third level occurred in each clinical department, respectively. This triage system was expected to avoid missing suspected cases through repeated temperature monitoring. Temperature of every patient and his/her companion who presented to our hospital were assessed by infrared thermometer (forehead or wrist) at each level of fever triage and the epidemiological history was inquired in detail (Table 1) .\n\nPatients with \"fever and respiratory disease\" or \"fever of unknown origin\" were guided to visit the fever clinic which was managed by the Emergency Department.\n\nDoctors who have been trained were designated to organize the screening, consultation, referral and reporting of suspected cases.\n\nDuring the outbreak, the hospital reserved a transfer channel and elevator near the prepared observational room. The channel and the elevator did not operate normally.\n\nIn case of suspected or confirmed cases, the dedicated channel and elevator were used All rights reserved.

Specially designated access for staff was opened to avoid cross infection.\n\nVisitors were strictly restricted. Each patient could only be accompanied by one person, and each accompanying person must accept daily temperature monitoring and report any symptoms of respiratory disease. Visitors were required to wear personal protective equipment and follow hand hygiene rules. Visitors of ICU patients were refused.\n\nOnce a fever patient with respiratory symptoms or a patient with fever of unknown origin plus positive history of epidemiology was identified by the fever clinic, the emergency response system was initiated immediately. Similarly, if any clinical department within our hospital identified a fever patient with respiratory symptoms or a patient with fever of unknown origin plus positive history of epidemiology was identified, the emergency response system would be initiated.\n\nIn accordance with \"Diagnosis and treatment guideline for novel coronavirus pneumonia (Trial version 6)\", 3 author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. China), making use of ultraviolet ray dynamic antivirus and ozone sterilization.\n\nClinically suspected patients were isolated immediately: 1) if identified by the fever clinic, the patient was isolated in the observational room of fever clinic, and then moved to a task-specific isolating room nearby; 2) if identified by a clinical department, the patient was moved to a prepared isolating room.\n\nThe swab or respiratory secretion was collected for first SARS-CoV-2 testing in our hospital lab using real-time fluorescence Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain\n\nReaction (RT-PCR) in all patients having a fever plus respiratory signs with/without a history of exposure and meeting the criteria of suspected case ( Patients were confirmed positive for COVID-19 based on two consecutive positive RT PCR tests. Patients were excluded based on two consecutive negative test results. The excluded patients were sent to the general outpatient clinic or ward for routine treatment but were kept in isolation for at least 2 days, or discharged home for self-isolation. If the patient's condition changed, the screening procedure was initiated again.\n\nConfirmed non-critical patients were transferred to the local public health clinical medical service center in a dedicated vehicle with a negative pressure filtration system.

The critically ill patients were transferred to the ICU with negative pressure filtration until their condition became stable and suitable for transfer. See Table 2 for severity classification criteria of COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\nAfter onset of COVID-19, a patient was determined to be 'recovered' when all of the following criteria were met: 1) Body temperature returned to normal for more than three days; 2) Respiratory symptoms improved significantly; 3) Chest radiography showed that the acute exudative lesions were significantly improved; 4) The RT PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was negative for two consecutive tests obtained at least 24 hours apart. Once recovered, patients were discharged home for 14 days isolation or 14 days isolation in a special quarantine facility.\n\nAt the beginning of the outbreak, staff training on COVID-19 pneumonia was organized immediately. The main contents of the training were: knowledge of characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia and pneumonia of unknown origin; skills in collecting history of epidemiology; diagnostic criteria, principles of treatment and requirements for reporting on outbreaks; skills of disinfection, isolation and personal protection. All medical staff took standard preventive measures. 5 Working clothes and medical masks were worn during the medical activities and rounds. The requirement of standard protection was wearing disposable preventive clothing or with protective apron, disposable working cap, protective mask, goggles or screen, disposable latex gloves, and shoe covers if necessary.\n\nThe nurses in the ward carried out health education for patients and companions, including personal protection, timely reporting of respiratory symptoms, not concealing epidemiological history, minimizing contact with others, correctly implementing coughing etiquette and hand hygiene.\n\nAll rights reserved.

All medical materials were supervised by specially-assigned personnel.\n\nThe medical devices, surface of the items and ground were disinfected daily with disinfectant containing chlorine 500-2000 mg/L or 75% alcohol in the fever clinic and the room with suspected or confirmed case. All wastes generated from suspected or confirmed cases were marked with \"COVID-19\" and treated as infectious wastes.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Of the three confirmed cases, one was a female visitor in her late 40`s who had no clear history of epidemiology but was identified as having cough. She was immediately sent to the fever clinic and was identified as having a fever. Through our emergency response system, she was quickly sampled for screening and confirmed COVID-19 after two consecutive positive SARS-CoV-2 tests. As a result of contact tracing, the female inpatient she visited and one male relative were subsequently confirmed positive for COVID-19 based on two positive RT PCR tests. These three COVID-19 confirmed patients were sent to the public health clinical service center for non-critical care. The male patient has been discharged after repeated negative SARS-CoV-2 testing, whilst the two female patients have not yet met discharge criteria and remained hospitalized at the end of the study follow-up period (28 February 2020).\n\nThere were no new infections of medical staff and no new infections of other inpatients in our hospital during this study period.\n\nAll rights reserved.

If we had focused all resources on screening outpatients at the fever clinic, we would have missed important in-hospital risks. We strongly recommend that screening resources should focus on self-presenting patients, hospital visitors and inpatients. Furthermore, the rapid establishment of the ability to test nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 using RT PCR in our hospital greatly shortened turn-around time and was beneficial in that it allowed early isolation and control of high-risk patients and discharge of low-risk (negative) patients.\n\nA hospital-specific protocol for screening and management is necessary if an epidemic outbreak occurs. In the situation of an unanticipated surge of patients combined with a relative shortage of medical resources (beds, staff and PPE), the establishment of screening and diagnostic protocol for suspected patients can focus medical resources on patients who need them and may help reduce missed cases.\n\nWe are unaware of any other papers documenting hospital screening processes for COVID-19. Although our process detected few patients, comparison with other processes, when they are published, perhaps will allow the identification of the optimal approach for screening and management.\n\nAll rights reserved.
