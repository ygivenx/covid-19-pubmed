It is becoming evident that following CNS insult and acute inflammation, the brain does not return to its pre-infection state; animal models of neurodegenerative disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and brain infection each show prolonged activation of resident microglia and sustained presence of memory T-cells. Overactive and persistent immune activation within the brain can be detrimental to sensitive neuronal cells resulting in focal neuropathology and, correspondingly, memory deficits (Armien et al. 2010) . Thus, suppression of persistent brain inflammation is critical to limiting bystander tissue damage and preserving neurological function.\n\nMicroglia are the resident immune cells of the brain and have been traditionally thought to be proinflammatory. Recent studies, however, suggest they play additional roles as immune regulators. Microglia limit CNS pathology by suppressing proinflammatory cytokine production from brain-infiltrating T-cells through activation of the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1): programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) pathway. PD-L1 (CD274, B7-H1), a co-inhibitory molecule expressed on antigen presenting cells, which plays a crucial role in the functional suppression of T-cell responses (Latchman et al. 2004 ). Engagement of PD-1 on activated CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells by PD-L1 has been shown as a mechanism for suppression of T-cell function, commonly referred to as T-cell exhaustion. In the absence of PD-L1 (PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice), coronavirus infection of the brain resulted in a heightened inflammatory response, ultimately leading to the more rapid clearance of virus from the CNS (Phares et al. 2013) . This comes at a cost however, PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited quicker onset of clinical symptoms and a higher rate of mortality, demonstrating the importance of this pathway in negatively regulating neuroinflammation in the brain. PD-L1 expression on microglia, as well as on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, has been shown to decrease T-cell activation in models of multiple sclerosis, as well as during acute viral encephalitis (Duncan and Miller 2011; Magnus et al. 2005; Phares et al. 2009 ). However, little is known about the immunoregulatory role of microglia during chronic, persistent neuroinflammation in animals that recover from viral brain infection.\n\nHuman cytomegalovirus (CMV) brain infection is the most significant cause of neurological disorders related to intrauterine infection in humans and is also a major cause of encephalitis during acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (Cheeran et al. 2009a) . Using a mouse model of murine (M)CMV infection, we have previously shown that, in the aftermath of a non-lethal acute viral infection, the CNS is maintained in a state of chronic neuroinflammation. Sustained immune activation within the brain is a key feature of herpesvirus pathogenicity (Armien et al. 2010) , along with the establishment of latency after clearance of acute infection and the potential for virus reactivation (Fields 2007) . Prolonged immune responses within the brain following MCMV infection are characterized by persistence of antibody-producing B-cells, chronic microglial cell activation, and retention of MCMV-specific effector-memory CD8 + T-cells (Mutnal et al. 2011b; Mutnal et al. 2012) . Although CD8 + T-cells play an important role in controlling acute brain infection (Reddehase et al. 1987; Reddehase et al. 1985) , the chronic presence of these IFN-\u03b3-producing T-cells may be damaging to the brain. While retention of antigen-specific CD8 + T-cells following MCMV infection helps to protect against virus reactivation, they are also responsible for long-term activation of microglia throughout the brain (Mutnal et al. 2011b) . Cytotoxic CD8 T-lymphocytes have been shown responsible for the destruction of healthy bystander neurons in the retina (McPherson et al. 2006) . Thus, maintaining CD8 + T-cells in a functionally suppressed state in the brain may enable both adequate neuroprotection from subsequent infection or reactivation, while also limiting unnecessary bystander neurotoxicity.\n\nIn the present study, we investigated the role of glial cells in the functional inhibition of persistent CD8 + T-cells in the post-encephalitic brain following MCMV infection. Specifically we show that PD-L1, expressed on microglia during chronic neuroinflammation, contributes to the suppression of antiviral CD8 + T-cell activity. Our data also demonstrate that astrocytes control CD8 + T-cytokine production through the PD-1: PD-L1 pathway.\n\nThis study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol Number: 1105A99494) of the University of Minnesota. All surgery was performed under Ketamine anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.\n\nRM461, a MCMV expressing Escherichia coli \u03b2-galactosidase under the control of the human ie1/ie2 promoter/enhancer (Stoddart et al. 1994) was kindly provided by Edward S. Mocarski. The virus was maintained by passage in weanling female Balb/c mice. Salivary gland-passed virus was then grown in NIH 3T3 cells for 2 passages, which minimized any carry over of salivary gland tissue. Infected 3T3 cultures were harvested at 80% to 100% cytopathic effect and subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (1000g) at 4 \u00b0C, and the virus was pelleted through a 35% sucrose cushion (in Tris-buffered saline [50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4]) at 23,000g for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. The pellet was suspended in Tris buffered saline containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). Viral stock titers were determined on 3T3 cells as 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID 50 ) per milliliter. Six to eight week old Balb/c mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA).\n\nInfection of mice with MCMV was performed as previously described (Cheeran et al. 2004 ). Briefly, female mice (6-8 week old) were anesthetized using a combination of Ketamine and Xylazine (20 mg and 2 mg/kg body weight, respectively) and immobilized on a small animal stereotactic instrument equipped with a Cunningham mouse adapter (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL). The skin and underlying connective tissue were reflected to expose reference sutures (sagittal and coronal) on the skull. The sagittal plane was adjusted such that bregma and lambda were positioned at the same coordinates on the vertical plane. Virulent, salivary gland-passaged MCMV RM461 (1.5 \u00d7 10 5 TCID 50 units in 10 \u03bcl), was injected into the right lateral ventricle at 0.9 mm lateral, 0.5 mm caudal, and 3.0 mm ventral to bregma using a Hamilton syringe (10 \u03bcl) fitted to a 27 G needle. The injection was delivered over a period of 3-5 min. The opening in the skull was sealed with bone wax and the skin was closed using 4-0 silk sutures with a FS-2 needle (Ethicon).\n\nLeukocytes were isolated from control and MCMV-infected murine brains using a previously described procedure with minor modifications (Cheeran et al. 2007; Ford et al. 1995; Havenith et al. 1998; Marten et al. 2003) . In brief, whole brains were harvested, pooled (n = 4 -6 animals/group/experiment), and minced finely in RPMI 1640 (2 g/L Dglucose and 10 mM HEPES) and digested in 0.0625% trypsin (in Ca/Mg-free HBSS) at room temperature for 20 min. Single cell preparations from infected brains were suspended in 30% Percoll and banded on a 70% Percoll cushion at 900 \u00d7 g at 15\u00b0C. Brain leukocytes obtained from the 30-70% Percoll interface were collected and used for 1) subsequent antibody staining for flow cytometry, or 2) suspended in RPMI for ex vivo culture experiments.\n\nFor flow cytometric antibody staining, brain leukocytes were first treated with Fc block (anti-CD32/CD16 in the form of 2.4G2 hybridoma culture supernatant with 2% normal rat and 2% normal mouse serum) to inhibit nonspecific Ab binding and were stained with antimouse immune cell surface markers for 45 min at 4\u00b0C (anti-CD45-PE-Cy5, anti-CD11b-APC-CY7, anti-CD4-e450, anti-CD8-AF700, anti-MHC class II-APC, and anti-PD-1-PE, and anti-PD-L1-PE or FITC (eBiosciences)). Analysis by flow cytometry was performed. Control isotype Abs were used for all fluorochrome combinations to assess nonspecific Ab binding. Live leukocytes were gated using forward scatter and side scatter parameters on a BD FACSCanto flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data was analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar).\n\nEx vivo cultures of brain leukocytes isolated from MCMV-infected mice at 14 d postinfection were used to investigate CD8 + T-cell cytokine production following antibody neutralization of the PD-1: PD-L1 pathway. Total brain leukocytes suspensions were seeded at a density of 1.3 \u00d7 10 5 cells/well and cultured at 37\u00b0C in RPMI complete supplemented with 10% FCS. Aminoguanidine (1 mM; Sigma) and indomethacin (20 \u03bcM; Sigma) were added to media to suppress nitric oxide synthetase and prostaglandin production (Duncan and Miller 2011) . Cells were treated for 1 h with either anti-PD-L1 neutralizing antibody (10 \u03bcg/mL; M1H5 clone; eBioscience) or rat IgG2a isotype control (10 \u03bcg/mL; eBioscience) prior to the addition of the CD8 T-cell specific MCMV-IE1 168-176 peptide (YPHFMPTNL; 5 \u03bcM and 50 \u03bcM) (Del Val et al. 1988 ). Anti-CD3 (2\u03bcg/mL) stimulation was included as a positive control. Supernatants were collected 48 h after peptide addition and frozen at \u221220\u00b0C until analysis. IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 concentration were measured using a mouse IFN-\u03b3 or IL-2 ELISA kit (eBioscience) according to manufacturers instructions.\n\nMurine cerebral cortical cells from 1-day-old Balb/c mice were dissociated after a 30-min trypsinization (0.25%) and were plated in 75-cm 2 Falcon culture flasks in DMEM containing 10% FBS, penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/ml), gentamicin (50 \u03bcg/ml) and Fungizone\u00ae (250 pg/ml). The medium was replenished 1 and 4 d after plating. On day 12 of culture harvested cells were plated in a 60-mm petri dish and incubated for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. After extensive washing with culture medium, adherent microglia were collected with a rubber policeman and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min. Purified microglial cell cultures were comprised of a cell population in which > 98% stained positively with Iba-1 antibodies and < 2% stained positively with antibodies specific to glial fibrillary acid protein, an astrocyte marker. Depending on the experiment, microglia were plated onto either 48-, 24-, or 12-well tissue culture plates (2\u00d710 4 , 2\u00d710 5 , 1\u00d710 6 cells/well, respectively) for RNA extraction and quantitation or for flow cytometric antibody staining.\n\nPurified astrocyte cultures were prepared from microglial cell seed cultures following isolation of microglia (see above) at 14 days in vitro. Briefly, after collection of microglia, culture flasks containing the remaining cells were shaken at 180-200 rpm at 37\u00b0C for 16 h followed by trypsinization with 0.25% trypsin in HBSS for 30 min. After adding FBS (final concentration 10%), centrifugation and washing, cells were seeded into new flasks with DMEM followed by medium change after 24 h. The subculture procedure was repeated weekly for 2 weeks to remove residual oligodendrocytes and microglia and achieve highly purified astrocyte cultures (95 -98 % of cells reacted with GFAP antibody). Depending on the experiment, astrocytes were then collected and seeded onto either 48-, 24-, or 12-well tissue culture plates (2\u00d710 4 , 2\u00d710 5 , 1\u00d710 6 cells/well, respectively) for RNA extraction and quantitation or for flow cytometric antibody staining.\n\nCD8 + T-cells were isolated using the MagCellect Mouse CD8 + T Cell Isolation Kit (R&D Systems) from the spleens and lymph nodes of naive Balb/c mice. Purified CD8 + T-cells were placed into culture and stimulated with anti-CD3 (2\u03bcg/mL) antibody for 1 h prior to transfer onto purified primary microglial or astrocyte cell cultures with or without IFN-\u03b3 pretreatment (8 h; 200U/mL; eBioscience). CD8 + T-cells were added at a 10:1 CD8: glial cell ratio. Neutralization of PD-1 and its ligand was performed by treating glial cells with anti-PD-1 (J43 clone; eBiosciences), anti-PD-L1 (M1H5 clone; eBiosciences), anti-PD-L2 (TY25 clone; eBiosciences), or IgG2a for 2 h prior to the addition of anti-CD3-activated CD8 T-cells. Supernatants were collected 48 h after the addition of T-cells and frozen at \u221220\u00b0C until analysis. IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 concentration were measured using a mouse IFN-\u03b3 or IL-2 ELISA kit (eBioscience) according to manufacturers instructions.\n\nRNA was extracted from purified microglia and astrocyte cell cultures using RNAse Easy Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized with 0.5 to 1.0 \u03bcg of total RNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and oligo dT6-12 primers (Sigma-Genosys, The Woodlands, TX). PCR was performed with the Advantage SYBR Green QPCR master mix (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The PCR conditions for the Mx3000P QPCR System (Stratagene) were: 40 denaturation cycles of 95\u00b0C for 10 s, annealing at 0\u00b0C for 10 s and elongation at 72\u00b0C for 10 s. The relative product levels were quantified using the 2(-Delta Delta C(T)) method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001) and were normalized to the housekeeping gene hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase-encoding (HPRT; NM_013556). Data presented are representative of three independent experiments. PD-L1 primer sequences (NM_021893.3): Forward = 5'-CGTGAGTGGGAAGAGAAGTGTC-3', Reverse = 5'-CTACAATGAGGAACAACAGGATGG-3'.\n\nBrains were harvested from infected mice that were perfused with serial washes of 2% sodium nitrate and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove contaminating blood cells and prefixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Murine brains were subsequently submerged in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h and transferred to 30% sucrose solution for 2 d. Brains were placed on a cryostat and tissues were cut into sections of 25 \u03bcm-thickness. Following rehydration of tissue sections with PBS, tissue was blocked (1\u00d7 PBS, 10% normal goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100) for 1 h at room temperature, brain sections were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the following primary antibodies: rat \u03b1-mouse MHC class II (10\u03bcg/mL; eBioscience), rabbit \u03b1-GFAP antibodies (1:1500; DAKO), rabbit \u03b1-Iba1 (2 \u03bcg/mL; Wako Chemicals), rat \u03b1-mouse CD8a (10 \u03bcg/mL; eBioscience). Brain sections were washed three times with PBS. After washing, secondary antibody (rhodamine-or FITCconjugate) was added for 1 h at RT followed by nuclear labeling with Hoechst 33342 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA; 1 \u03bcg/ml) and viewing under fluorescent microscope.\n\nFor comparison of means of multiple groups, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed followed by either Fisher's protected least significant difference (PLSD)-test or Scheffe-test. For comparison of means of pairs of data a two-tailed Student's T-test for paired samples was applied.\n\nDirect injection of MCMV into the brain of Balb/c mice results in acute viral encephalitis. This infection is rapidly cleared through the action of microglia, the resident CNS immune sentinels, and the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells from the periphery. We have previously shown that this acute and controlled viral brain infection results in chronic neuroinflammation that can persist for at least 30 d following viral clearance (Mutnal et al. 2011b) . Isolation and flow cytometry of brain mononuclear cells (BMNCs), including microglia and CNS-infiltrating leukocytes, from MCMV-infected mice showed that microglia upregulate the surrogate activation marker, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, during the acute phase of infection and continue to chronically express this protein on their surface (Mutnal et al. 2011b) . MHC class II expression on microglia is notably absent in sham-, mock-and un-infected mice. In the present study, we first confirmed this widespread and prolonged expression of MHC class II on microglia using immunohistochemistry. At 30 days post-infection (dpi) in the post-encephalitic brains of MCMV-infected mice, ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) was found to colocalize with MHC class II on activated microglia ( Figure 1A ).\n\nRecent studies suggest that antigen presenting cells, such as microglia, can suppress T-cell activation through the PD-1: PD-L1 inhibitory pathway. Microglial suppression of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells has been shown during the active phase of viral infection in murine models of multiple sclerosis (Carter et al. 2007; Magnus et al. 2005; Phares et al. 2013 ). It is not known whether similar mechanisms are involved in the inhibition of T-cells persisting within the CNS during chronic neuroinflammation in the absence of active viral replication. Using our MCMV brain infection model, we first examined the kinetics of PD-L1 expression on microglia from the acute, productive phase of infection (7 dpi) into the chronic neuroinflammatory, post-viral clearance phase (30 dpi). Resting microglia, which are identified by flow cytometry as the CD45 int CD11b + population, in uninfected mice expressed low levels of PD-L1. In contrast, during the acute phase of viral infection PD-L1 surface expression on microglia increased dramatically (control = 19.7% vs. MCMVinfected = 90.6%) and remained elevated during persistent neuroinflammation (29.4%) ( Figure 1B) .\n\nCD8 + T-cells are pivotal to the active clearance of virus from the brain during MCMV infection. As previously shown in mouse models of herpesvirus brain infection (Armien et al. 2010; Mutnal et al. 2011b ), we found immunohistological evidence that CD8 + T-cells persist in the post-encephalitic brain following MCMV clearance (Figure 2 A) . In addition, kinetic analysis of BMNCs for brain infiltrating CD8 + T-cells (gated on the CD45 + CD11b low infiltrating T-cell population) from MCMV-infected brain homogenates showed an increase in the percentage of CD8 + T-cells as the infection progressed from the acute (7 dpi = 29.9 %) to chronic (30 dpi = 64.5 %) phases of disease (Figure 2 B) . In brain tissues obtained from sham-infected, control animals, infiltrating CD45(hi) cells were found to be rare (5.6%) (Cheeran et al. 2009b; Mutnal et al. 2010; Mutnal et al. 2011a) .\n\nAntigen experienced CD8 + T-cells are known to express PD-1 as an indicator of activation and, subsequently, exhaustion (Hofmeyer et al. 2011 ). However, the state of PD-1 expression on persistent CD8 + T-cells in the brain following viral encephalitis is unknown. To investigate the interaction of microglia and CD8 + T-cells during chronic neuroinflammation we examined CD8 + T-cell PD-1 expression kinetics following MCMV brain infection. To this end, BMNCs were isolated from MCMV-infected mice at 7 and 30 dpi. The CD45 + CD11b low -identified T-cell population was further gated on for analysis of the CD8 + subpopulation. During the acute phase of infection (7 dpi) PD-1 surface expression on CD8 + T-cells within the brain was elevated (40.7%). PD-1 expression remained elevated on CD8 + T-cells during CNS persistence (14 dpi = 14.7%; 30 dpi = 8.3 %), however the percentage of PD-1 + CD8 cells decreased compared to levels observed during the acute infection ( Figure 2C ). The CD45 + CD11b low population of T-cells is notably absent from mock-and un-infected mice (Cheeran et al. 2007 ), thus PD-1 expression on CD8+ T-cells within control mice is not measurable.\n\nChronic activation and PD-L1 expression on microglia following MCMV brain infection, along with the retention and long-term PD-1 expression on CD8 + T-cells, suggests glial cell involvement in the functional suppression of residual T-cells in the post-viral encephalitic brain. Using primary microglial cells, we directly examined the inhibitory effects of microglial PD-L1 on CD8 + T-cell activation. First, we confirmed the activation and upregulation of PD-L1 on cultured microglial in response to IFN-\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2, proinflammatory cytokines found during acute and chronic infection (Armien et al. 2010; Marques et al. 2008; Mutnal et al. 2011b ). IFN-\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, or IL-1\u03b2 stimulation for 24 h resulted in a 4-fold increase in PD-L1 mRNA expression in microglia, compared to unstimulated controls ( Figure 3A) . Similarly, 24 h incubation with IFN-\u03b3, a potent T-cellsecreted cytokine, resulted in a robust increase of surface-expressed PD-L1 on microglia (control = 8.6 %; IFN-\u03b3 = 92.9 %) ( Figure 3B ). These data confirmed previous reports that resting microglia express low levels of PD-L1 (Magnus et al. 2005) . As an positive control for microglial activation, we found that IFN-\u03b3-treatment induced microglial expression of MHC class II (control = 18.0 %; IFN-\u03b3 = 81.7 %) ( Figure 3C ). Both constitutive and INF-\u03b3induced MHC class I expression were also detected (control = 44.1 %; IFN-\u03b3 = 74.5%) ( Figure 3D ).\n\nTo examine microglial inhibition of CD8 + T-cell activation through PD-L1, we co-cultured CD8 + cells with IFN-\u03b3-stimulated primary microglia. Microglia were pretreated with IFN-\u03b3 for 8 h before being co-cultured with either unstimulated CD8 + T-cells, which express little PD-1 (11%), or with CD8 + T-cells stimulated to express PD-1 (30.5%) via anti-CD3 antibody pre-treatment (48 h) (Figure 4 A) . Co-culture of unstimulated CD8 + T-cells with microglia produced negligible levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 in the culture supernatant (Figure 4 B, C). As expected, anti-CD3-stimulated CD8 + T-cells in co-culture with microglia presented a significant increase in IFN-\u03b3 (p<0.001) and IL-2 (p<0.001) production. Blockade of PD-L1 on microglia using an anti-PD-L1 neutralizing antibody enhanced CD8 + T-cell IFN-\u03b3 anti-PD-L1 (p = 0.0024) and IL-2 production. Similarly, blockade of PD-1 on CD8 + T-cells with anti-PD-1 neutralizing antibody enhanced IFN-\u03b3 (anti-PD-1, p = 0.0187) and IL-2 production. In contrast, neither anti-PD-L2 neutralizing antibody nor control IgG significantly affected CD8 + T-cell IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 levels in the supernatant.\n\nPrevious studies in mouse models of multiple sclerosis have shown that microglia and infiltrating macrophages inhibit immune activation via PD-L1 interaction with PD-1 on CD8 + T-cells (Duncan and Miller 2011; Phares et al. 2013 ). These studies, however, concentrate on the role of the PD-1: PD-L1 interaction in limiting T-cell activation using a demyelinating disease model caused by an active viral infection. In this study we focused on the function of glial-expressed PD-L1 in the persistently inflamed CNS of MCMV-infected mice (> 14 dpi); this is long past the acute, virally active phase of disease, which is complete by 7 dpi. The role of microglial PD-L1 expression in suppressing chronic post-encephalitic neuroinflammation is unknown.\n\nIn order to test the functional role of PD-L1 expression in the brain of post-encephalitic mice, we first isolated BMNCs from MCMV-infected mice at 14 dpi, a time point void of active viral replication and associated with the transition into chronic neuroinflammation, and placed them into ex vivo cultures. Total BMNCs, which include CD4 + T-cells, CD8 + Tcells and microglia, were incubated with MCMV IE1 168-176 (0, 5, and 50 \u03bcM), which has previously been identified as a CD8 + T-cell-specific MHC class I restricted epitope (Del Val et al. 1988; Holtappels et al. 2002) , for 48 h and supernatants were analyzed for IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 via ELISA. MCMV IE1 168-176 stimulation alone resulted in a dose-dependent increase in CD8 + T-cell IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 production (Figure 5 A, B) . Using PD-L1 neutralizing antibody, added 1 h prior to MCMV IE1 168-176 stimulation, we were able to specifically assess the role of PD-L1 on CD8 + T-cell IFN-\u03b3 production. In the presence of anti-PD-L1 antibody, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 increased dramatically, compared to untreated and IgG2a-treated control microglia; IFN-\u03b3 production in the presence of anti-PD-L1 antibody increased 72% (50 \u03bcM IE1) and 250% (5 \u03bcM IE1). Similarly, IL-2 production increased 20% (50 \u03bcM IE1) and 120% (5 \u03bcM IE1) above untreated and IgG2a-treated controls.\n\nAstrocytes were the first glial cell shown to be inducible for MHC class II expression (Lipp et al. 2007; Shrikant and Benveniste 1996) . In comparison to microglia, astrocyte MHC class II expression is slower to develop and less robust, thus deeming them the \"nonprofessional\" antigen presenting cells in the brain (Vardjan et al. 2012) . Little is known about the antigen presenting capacity of astrocytes in our model of MCMV-induced encephalitis. In this study, we first examined MCMV-infected brain tissue and confirmed MHC class II colocalization with GFAP-labeled astrocytes in post-encephalitic (30 dpi) mice ( Figure 6A ). Chronic astrocyte activation, as indicated by MHC class II expression, a known marker for glial cell activation, suggests a role for these cells during postencephalitic neuroinflammation, like that observed for microglia. Indeed, when in co-culture with T-cells, astrocytes have been shown to suppress T-cell activation by IFN-\u03b3 (Gold et al. 1996) . However, the mechanisms by which astrocytes suppress T-cells are currently unknown.\n\nUsing purified murine astrocyte cultures we investigated the effects of the T-cell produced, proinflammatory cytokine IFN-\u03b3 on astrocyte activation and PD-L1 expression. Unstimulated and IFN-\u03b3-stimulated astrocytes can be extracted from culture plates via light trypsinization (0.5 % Trypsin in HBSS) for 15 min and identified by flow cytometry using forward-and side-scatter ( Figure 6B ). Flow cytometry confirmed that, like microglia, IFN-\u03b3 stimulation (24 h) resulted in the robust activation of astrocytes as indicated by MHC class II ( Figure 6C ) and PD-L1 surface protein expression ( Figure 6D ). In addition, semiquantitative RT-PCR of IFN-\u03b3-stimulated astrocytes in vitro also showed an increase in PD-L1 mRNA expression compared to unstimulated control cells ( Figure 6E ). Surface expression of MHC class I was also detected on unstimulated and IFN-\u03b3-stimulated (24 h) astrocytes ( Figure 6F ).\n\nBased on our finding that microglial expressed PD-L1 inhibited CD8 + T-cell activation in the post encephalitic, chronically inflamed brain, we hypothesized that IFN-\u03b3-activated murine astrocytes would also possess the ability to suppress CD8 + T-cell function via interaction through PD-1 and PD-L1. To this end, we co-cultured unstimulated or CD3stimulated CD8 + T-cells with purified murine astrocytes. Astrocytes were stimulated with IFN-\u03b3 for 24 h before being co-cultured with the CD8 + T-cells. Co-cultures of unstimulated CD8 + T-cells with astrocytes produced negligible levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 in the culture supernatant (Figure 7 A, B) . As expected, anti-CD3-stimulated CD8 + T-cells resulted in a significant increase in IFN-\u03b3 (p<0.001) and IL-2(p<0.001). Blockade of PD-L1 on astrocytes using an anti-PD-L1 neutralizing antibody enhanced CD8 + T-cell IFN-\u03b3 anti-PD-L1 (p < 0.001) and IL-2 (p = 0.003) production. Similarly, blockade of PD-1 on CD8 + T-cells with anti-PD-1 neutralizing antibody enhanced IFN-\u03b3 (p < 0.001) and IL-2 (p = 0.0016) production compared to unstimulated co-cultures and cultures treated with IgG antibody. Similar to microglia, anti-PD-L2 neutralizing antibody did not affect CD8 + T-cell production of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 when in co-culture with astrocytes.\n\nLong-term, persistent inflammation of the CNS is commonly seen during neurodegenerative disease, stroke and viral brain infection (Neumann 2001) . Observations in animal models of brain infection and disease show that chronic neuroinflammation typically consists of the retention of CD8 + T-cells and heightened activation of MHC class II on resident microglia. A similar profile for chronic brain inflammation is reported in this study, where immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry show that approximately 30% of microglia continue to express the surrogate marker for glial cell activation, MHC class II, at 30 dpi (Figure 1) , long past clearance of active viral replication in the brain. We also confirmed previous findings that, as MCMV brain infection progressed from the productive phase into the chronic persistent phase, the percent of CD8 + T-cells within the CD45 + CD11b low leukocyte population increased from 30% (7 dpi) to 65% (30 dpi) (Figure 2 ), making CD8 + T-cells the predominant brain-infiltrating immune cell type following viral encephalitis. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this study is the first to report the upregulation and maintained expression of MHC class II on astrocytes during MCMV-infection ( Figure 6 ).\n\nCD8 + T-cells that remain following MCMV brain infection are, at least partially, antigenspecific. IFN-\u03b3 secretion by these cells is responsible for long-term microglial activation and TNF\u03b1 production (Mutnal et al. 2011b) . Synergistic action of TNF\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 in the brain has been shown to increase nitric oxide-induced neurodegeneration (Blais and Rivest 2004) , emphasizing the importance of minimizing chronic neuroinflammation. If not carefully managed, extended inflammation in the brain can lead to secondary neuronal injury and resultant neurocognitive dysfunction (Armien et al. 2010) .\n\nMicroglia, traditionally thought to provide CNS immune surveillance and proinflammatory support, are now also believed to have a role in negatively regulating active T-cell responses in the brain. PD-1 binding with the negative co-stimulatory molecule PD-L1, which is upregulated on antigen presenting cells, is a well-known mechanism for suppression of CD8 + T-cell proliferation and function (Dong et al. 1999; Kobata et al. 2000; Sharpe and Freeman 2002) . Microglia are the foremost antigen presenting cells of the brain, as evidenced through their expression of MHC class I and II in response to brain infection (Neumann 2001; Sedgwick et al. 1993) . As previously reported (Magnus et al. 2005 ), we found low basal expression of PD-L1 on microglia, approximately 20% of cells in uninfected mice expressed surface PD-L1 (Figure 1) . PD-L1 expression on microglia increased robustly during the acute stage of infection, coinciding with the infiltration of IFN-\u03b3-secreting CD8 + T-cells and increased CNS TNF\u03b1 (Cheeran et al. 2007) . Similarly, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 treatment increased PD-L1 on in vitro cultured microglia, confirming the role of those cytokines in PD-L1 upregulation (Figure 3) . Furthermore, we found that blockade of the PD-1 pathway with either PD-1 or PD-L1 neutralizing antibody, both in vitro and in ex vivo brain leukocyte extracts, resulted in increased CD8+ T-cell IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 production. These data demonstrate that microglia suppress CD8 + T-cell function, as indicated by IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 production, through the PD-1: PD-L1 pathway.\n\nIn this study, MHC Class II expression on microglia and astroglia was used only as an indicator of glial cell activation in response to proinflammatory stimulation. With respect to glial-cell suppression of CD8+ T-cells, MHC Class I expression is the critical component, not MHC Class II. To demonstrate this, in Figure 5 we assessed the effects of glialexpressed PD-L1 on CD8+ T-cells isolated from the brains of MCMV-infected mice at 14 dpi. In this experiment we used a MHC Class I restricted peptide for specific CD8+ T-cell restimulation (MCMV IE1168-176). We, and others, have previously shown this peptide to robustly activate CD8+ T-cell ex vivo, as indicated by IFN-\u03b3 stimulation (Del Val et al. 1988; Holtappels et al. 2002; Mutnal et al. 2012 ).\n\nUsing the JHM strain of neurotropic coronavirus, which induces acute encephalomyelitis in mice, Phares et al., demonstrated that PD-L1 expression on microglia and oligodendroglia during active viral infection facilitated the suppression of CD8 T-cell function (Phares et al. 2009 ). Similarly, Duncan et al. showed that microglia in the CNS during active Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection, which is used as a model for multiple sclerosis, upregulate PD-L1. Using neutralizing antibody to PD-L1, they showed that ex vivo microglia suppressed CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell cytokine production through engagement of the T-cell PD-1 receptor. In vivo blockade of PD-L1, again using neutralizing antibody, resulted in decreased viral loads, but also caused an increase in mortality, presumably through exacerbated immune-mediated damage to the nervous system (Duncan and Miller 2011) . While these previous studies have primarily focused on PD-L1 in managing T-cell function during acute viral CNS infection, the present study shows the involvement of this negative regulatory pathway in inhibiting persistent CD8 + T-cell function during post-viral encephalitic chronic neuroinflammation. Specifically, treatment of isolated BMNCs, consisting of microglia and brain-infiltrating leukocytes, with PD-L1 neutralizing antibody increased the production of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 from MCMV-IE1 168-176 -stimulated memory CD8 + T-cells ( Figure 5) . These experiments were performed on cells extracted from MCMV-infected brains at 14 dpi, approximately 1 week following the clearance of active viral infection. To our knowledge, this is the first experiment demonstrating the role of microglial PD-L1 on inhibiting brain CD8 + T-cells during chronic neuroinflammation and in the absence of productive viral infection.\n\nThe role of astrocytes acting as antigen presenting cells is well reported (Shrikant and Benveniste 1996) . In this study we corroborate previous findings that IFN-\u03b3 robustly upregulates MHC class II expression on purified cultures of murine astrocytes. In addition, we report that IFN-\u03b3 stimulation induced PD-L1 upregulation on purified astrocytes in vitro, suggesting the involvement of astrocytes as an additional immunosuppressive cell type. Indeed, Pittet et al. have previously shown that IFN-\u03b3 stimulation of purified cultures of human astrocytes induced surface PD-L1 expression, which suppress T-lymphocytes via engagement of PD-1 on the surface of CD8 cells (Pittet et al. 2011) . Furthermore, we confirmed that astrocytes regulate T-cells by inhibiting CD8 + T-cell cytokine production through the physical engagement of T-cell-expressed PD-1 and glial-expressed PD-L1 (Gold et al. 1996) . As techniques for isolating and culturing astrocytes from the brains of adult mice become available, ex vivo verification of T-cell suppression by astrocytes by this pathway will be required. Multiple studies have clearly shown that, in relation to effector Tcell stimulation, microglia are superior to astrocytes. IFN\u03b3 induces microglia expression of T-cell co-stimulatory molecules (CD80 & CD86) that are necessary second-signals for glia to functionally activate T-cells (Aloisi 2001) . To our knowledge, there have been no reports of astrocytes either expressing these co-stimulatory molecules or being able to effectively activate T-cells (Cross and Ku 2000) . Studies by Magnus et al., suggest that while astrocytes and microglia both inhibit T-cell function, the effect is more pronounced in the latter cell type (Magnus et al. 2005) . Our in vitro studies show that PD-L1 neutralization resulted in more potent recovery of CD8 + T-cell IFN-\u03b3 production in astrocyte co-cultures (2.4-fold increase) compared to microglia co-cultures (1.5-fold). PD-L1 neutralization had comparable effects on IL-2 production in both microglia and astrocyte co-cultures. These data suggest a more potent role for astrocytes in CD8 + T-cell suppression in the brain. Such conclusions, however, cannot be drawn from the experiments conducted in this study because of our inability to assess the percentage of PD-L1 expression on astrocytes in the post-encephalitic brain or to evaluate the effect of PD-L1 neutralization on astrocytes using ex vivo glial: BMNC co-cultures.\n\nWhile reports of chronic neuroinflammation are becoming more common, the role for persistent immune activation remains elusive. Within the context of viral encephalitis, studies have shown that persistent microglial activation as well as CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell infiltration is associated with neurotoxicity and neurocognitive dysfunction, suggesting extended neuroinflammation may be harmful to the brain (Armien et al. 2010) . Conversely, maintaining an antigen-specific CD8 + T-cell population in the brain would aide in the rapid clearance of reactivated virus from latently infected neurons (Mutnal et al. 2012; Tsutsui et al. 1995) . Regardless of their purpose, this paper shows that brain cells actively contribute to the suppression of CD8 + T-cells and suggests that a new homeostatic environment is created in the post-encephalitic CNS that maintains elevated immune surveillance coupled with brain-cell mediated regulation of persistent adaptive immune cells. (A) CD8 + T-cells from uninfected Balb/c mice were placed into culture (2\u00d710 5 cells/well) wells coated with \u03b1-CD3 Abs (2 \u03bcg/mL).

(B & C) Unstimulated CD8 T-cells (untreated) or CD3-stimulated CD8 + T-cells were transferred into co-culture with microglia that recieved an IFN-\u03b3 (200 Units/mL) pre-treatment for 8 h. CD8 + T-cells were added at a 10:1 CD8: glial cell ratio. Prior to CD8+ T-cell addition, co-cultures were left untreated (control) or treated for 2 h with \u03b1-PD-L1, \u03b1-PD-L2, or \u03b1-PD-1 neutralizing antibody.
