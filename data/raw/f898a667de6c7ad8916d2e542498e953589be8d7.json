{"title": "Hypothesis Computer aided prediction and identification of potential epitopes in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike (S) glycoprotein of MERS-CoV", "body": "(WHO), till date a total of 536 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infections have been identified, 145 of which resulted in death (http: //www.who.int /csr/disease /coronavirus infections/archive_updates/en). Though it has not hit the world population in a massive scale yet, its progressive invasiveness with concerning fatality rate raises the demand of therapeutic solutions or vaccination on an urgent basis.\n\nThe field of Computational Immunology is developing rapidly. Current tools enable us to predict potential epitopes from large protein antigens encoded by viral genomes. Identification of B-and T-cell epitopes and their respective MHC alleles is the crucial step for the very initial screening process of immunoinformatics approach [3] .\n\nCoronavirus possess a non-structural replicase polyprotein and several structural proteins including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [4, 5] . Like other coronaviruses, the host cell recognition of MERS-CoV by CD26 receptor is mediated by its surface anchored S glycoprotein [6, 7] . This S glycoprotein has S1 and S2 subunits. S1 subunit contains RBD which mediates initial host cell recognition whereas S2 subunit mediates membrane fusion [8, 9] .\n\nSeveral recent studies have revealed that the N-terminal 367-606 amino acid region of S glycoprotein of MERS-CoV is bound with human CD26 and produces significant immune response. This phenomenon suggests that the receptor binding capacity of MERS-CoV lies in this particular region of S glycoprotein [10, 11] . Considering these facts, our approach was to choose this particular region of S glycoprotein for the prediction and identification of the potential T-and B-cell epitopes in this computational study.\n\nThe sequences of S glycoprotein were retrieved from two databases: NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and uniprot (http://www.uniprot.org/). These sequences belong to diverse demographic distributions like Saudi Arabia, England, Qatar, Spain, Germany, Jordan, and UAE with time ranges from 2012 to 2013.\n\nThe Clustal Omega software (version 1.2.1) was utilized to generate multiple sequence alignment for retrieved sequences which was the basis for determining the conservancy of MERS CoV RBD [12] .\n\nDifferent tools available from the IEDB analysis resource (http://tools.immuneepitope.org/main/index.html) were used to evaluate the immunogenicity of MERS-CoV RBD. The NetCTL prediction method was utilized for identifying T-cell epitopes from this region [13, 14] . The MHC class-I binding prediction tool was used to identify MHC class-I alleles for the final set of T-cell epitopes based on Stabilized Matrix Method (SMM) [15] .\n\n\"Proteasomal cleavage/TAP transport/MHC class I combined predictor\" was utilized for determining the overall score for each peptide's intrinsic capability to be considered as a T cell epitope (http://tools.immuneepitope.org/processing/) [15] [16] [17] . The epitope conservancy analysis tool was utilized to calculate the conservancy of the final set of epitopes within the sequences of S glycoprotein [18] . In addition to this, The ProPred1 and SYFPEITHI databases were also employed to identify the anchoring residues of the epitopes [19, 20] .\n\nThe 3D structure of MHC class-I molecule (HLA-C*12:03) was retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (HLA-C*12:03; PDB ID: 2FSE) database (http: //www.rcsb.org /pdb/home/ home.do). The 3D structure of the best epitope CYSSLILDY (see discussion section) was designed by using PEPstr peptide tertiary structure prediction server (http:/ /www.imtech.res.in /raghava/pepstr/).\n\nThe AutoDock tools (ADT) from the MGL software package (version 1.5.6) and AutoDock vina (Vina, version 4.2) were used for molecular docking study [21, 22] . At the beginning of the docking study, both the 3D structures of protein (HLA-C*12:03) and ligand (CYSSLILDY) were opened in ADT. For the epitope to be bound at the binding groove of HLA-C*12:03, the centre grid box parameter was set at 22.474, 5.416, 34.437 A\u00ba in x, y and z directions respectively with 1.0 A\u00ba spacing. The points were set at 40, 38, 52 A\u00ba in x, y and z directions respectively. AutoDock tool was utilized to set the above parameters whereas AutoDock vina was applied for conducting docking experiment. Output files were visualized by PyMOL molecular visualization system (version: 1.5.0.3). Along with this, the Immunodominant Determinant of human type-2 collagen (PDB ID: 2FSE) was used as ligand to run positive control maintaining all the parameters as same as initial docking of this study.\n\nThe B-cell epitope prediction tool from IEDB was used to predict the B-cell antigenicity of MERS-CoV RBD. The Kolaskar and Tongaonkar method was employed for this prediction which can predict antigenic determinants with approximately 75% accuracy [23]. \n\nAn illustration of the MERS-CoV RBD in complex with the human CD26 protein (DPP4) is given in Figure 1 . A total of 54 sequences of S glycoprotein were subjected to multiple sequence alignment. From the output of multiple sequence alignment of S glycoprotein, it was found that a peptide region of 367-606 amino acids remained conserved among all the given sequences (Figure 2A) . Thus the above finding gives a convincing affirmation that MERS-CoV RBD is a well conserved region.\n\n235 overlapping CTL peptides and 79 possible MHC-1 alleles were predicted by NetCTL and MHC class-I binding prediction tool, respectively. The final set of epitopes and their respective MHC class-I allele was generated on the basis of a total score \u2265 1 and the \"half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)\" value \u2264 100. This final set includes only eight T-cell epitopes and a total of 19 MHC class-I alleles (Figure 2A & Figure 2B) . A graphical presentation of the result predicted by the NetCTL prediction tool is given in Figure 3 . The immunogenicity of final epitopes was also determined in terms of proteasome score, TAP score, MHC-I binding score and processing score. All of the eight T-cell epitopes demonstrated 100% sequence conservancy within the given sequences of S glycoprotein which is summarized in Table 1 (See supplementary material).\n\nThe T-cell epitopes predicted by NetCTL prediction tool. Most of the epitopes failed to cross threshold level (1.0). Green coloured sharp points indicate the epitopes that crossed the threshold level. In this graph, x-axis represents the residue positions of predicted epitope whereas y-axis represents their score.\n\nThe designed epitope (CYSSLILDY) and experimental epitope (immunodominant determinant of human type-2 collagen; PDB ID: 2FSE) are displayed in Figure 3 . AutoDock vina predicted the best conformer of CYSSLILDY epitope based on the binding energy in kcal/mol unit. In our study, the best conformer of this epitope had the binding energy of -8.3 kcal/mol which was very similar with that of the positive control experiment (-7.5 kcal/mol). Among 9 residues in the epitope, only cysteine, serine and tyrosine (first, fourth and ninth residue, respectively) showed the anchoring capacity and other six residues remained at the binding groove of HLA-C*12:03 molecule. For both the designed and experimental epitopes at the binding groove of HLA-C*12:03, a comparative analysis of their binding pattern is illustrated in Figure 4 .\n\nThe graphical depiction of B-cell antigenicity of MERS-CoV RBD is in Figure 5 . Average antigenic propensity for this region is 1.050. Twelve antigenic determinants were found from this region which is presented in Table 2 (See supplementary material). To be considered as a potent epitope, a peptide must contain several key properties like well conservancy, T-or B-cell processivity and good binding affinity for MHC alleles. In our study, the values for above mentioned parameters were found in favour of the finally chosen epitopes.\n\nIn this study we used NetCTL prediction tool for the primary screening of the RBD of S glycoprotein of MERS-CoV for T-cell epitope prediction which is based on neural network architecture. It predicts the epitopes on the basis of processing of peptide in vivo. It gives a total score for each epitopes by using an algorithm integrating MHC-I binding, Transporter of Antigenic peptides (TAP) transport efficiency and proteasomal cleavage prediction [13, 14] .\n\nAmong eight T-cell epitopes, CYSSLILDY was the most successful because it was found to have the maximum interactions with different MHC class-I alleles which is a principle prerequisite for a potential epitope. In addition to this, it was found that the peptide region of 408-452 amino acids \"NYNLTKLLSLFSVNDFTCSQISPAAIASNCYSSLILDYFSYPL S\" of S glycoprotein of MERS-CoV shows the highest B-cell antigenicity peak in antigenicity plot. Most importantly, we observed that the best successful T-cell epitope CYSSLILDY is also a part of the region which shows highest B-cell antigenicity peak, suggesting that it may stand as a competent choice to be a universal vaccine component against MERS-CoV, the rapidly growing health concern.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe obtained results which identified the epitopes cover a significant number of strains with decent population coverage. To exert cellular and humoral immunity, the computer aided result has been found potential and expected to mount immune response upon further in vivo and in vitro validation. The step by step analysis and progression for maximum possible MHC coverage provides significant primary screening result against this fatal virus. "}
