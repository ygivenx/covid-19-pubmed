{"title": "Author manuscript; available in PMC", "body": "Membrane fusion is a fundamental biological process that occurs in intracellular trafficking, exocytosis, resealing of plasma membranes, protein trafficking, and in the entry of enveloped viruses. This ubiquitous process is mediated and tightly controlled by a combination of specific protein machinery and lipid composition 1 . Lipids spontaneously assemble into bilayer structures such as liposomes; however, lipid bilayer membranes do not spontaneously fuse 2 . The spontaneous negative or positive curvature of a lipid can enhance or diminish fusion, respectively, but energy must be expended to overcome hydration repulsion between membranes and to disrupt the bilayer structure. The energy for this remodeling may be derived from the thermal fluctuations of the membrane or from specialized fusion proteins 2 . Many biological processes, such as neuronal synaptic vesicle fusion, endosomal fusion, and exocytosis, employ the SNARE superfamily proteins 3 . SNAREs are found in all eukaryotic organisms. All SNARE proteins have a common heptad-repeat that forms four-helix coiledcoil structures, and this coiled-coil SNARE complex forms in trans to promote fusion of the two membranes in which the SNARE proteins are anchored 4 . Enveloped viruses use an analogous strategy and mediate fusion with target cells through specialized fusion proteins. The paramyxovirus parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) requires two surface glycoproteins for this process: the attachment protein hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) that binds sialic acid and the fusion protein (F) that physically merges the two membranes. Paramyxovirus fusion occurs at the plasma membrane and does not require the low pH of the endosome to trigger fusion 5 .\n\nThe paramyxovirus F protein is a class I fusion glycoprotein that is synthesized as a type I integral membrane protein and it folds into homotrimers, is post-translationally modified by the addition of carbohydrate chains, and then is proteolytically cleaved to become biologically active. Similar processing occurs for other class I viral fusion proteins, such as influenza virus HA, HIV gp160, retrovirus Env, Ebola GP, and SARS CoV S 5 . The paramyxovirus F precursor protein (F0) is cleaved into the membrane-anchored F1 subunit and the smaller N-terminal F2 fragment. F1 contains two hydrophobic regions, the N-terminal fusion peptide (FP), located at the new N-terminus after cleavage, and the transmembrane (TM) domain, and two heptad repeat regions, HRA and HRB. HRA is located immediately C-terminal to the FP, and HRB is proximal to the TM domain 5 .\n\nThe paramyxovirus F protein folds initially into a metastable prefusion form (Fig. 1A) that upon triggering undergoes a series of large scale conformational rearrangements, proceeding down an energy gradient to form a final irreversible postfusion form (Fig 1B-D) . Recently, the crystal structures of both the uncleaved prefusion conformation of the paramyxovirus F protein and the uncleaved postfusion conformation were solved 6; 7 . The prefusion form contains a globular head containing three domains (DI-DIII) attached to a trimeric coiled-coil stalk formed by the HRB region. The HRA region in the prefusion form is composed of 11 distinct segments that wrap around the DIII core in the globular head 7 . This is in contrast to the postfusion form of F where HRA is extended into a long \u03b1-helix as part of the 6-HB. For the postfusion structure an unanticipated finding emerged as the available data indicate the F TM domain and/or cytoplasmic tail are important for the folding of F into the metastable prefusion form of F 6 : secreted F lacking a TM domain converts to the postfusion form.\n\nUpon receptor binding, biochemical studies indicate HN induces a conformational change in F and the HRB three-helix stalk separates 8 . It is hypothesized that following the melting of the HRB helices and destabilization of the head (Fig. 1B) , HRA refolds to form an extended \u03b1helical coiled-coil, which enables the insertion of the fusion peptide into the target cell membrane and forms the pre-hairpin intermediate 7 (Fig 1C) . The F protein then refolds where HRB binds into the grooves between the HRA monomers and forms the six-helix bundle , bringing the FP and TM domain into juxtaposition within the same membrane 7; 9; 10; 11 ( Fig 1D) . A conceptually related final post-fusion structure is formed for all enveloped virus fusion proteins. The postfusion structure either consists of a \u03b1-helical coiled-coil structure like the 6-HB in PIV5 F or \u03b2-strand structures in other fusion proteins, like Dengue virus E, Semliki Forest virus E1, and vesicular stomatits virus (VSV) G 12 . In all cases the fusion peptide and TM domain are together in the same membrane. The formation of the 6-HB and the associated free energy change is tightly linked to the merger of the target and viral membranes 8; 13 . The collapse of the pre-hairpin intermediate distorts the bilayers to possibly form an initial pointlike protrusion 14 . Whether the insertion of the fusion peptide perturbs the lipid bilayer and lowers the distortion energy is unknown 14 . Following the initial bilayer contact, membrane merger proceeds to the lipid stalk intermediate, where the outer leaflets of each bilayer merges but the inner leaflets remain separate. This stalk then expands to form the hemifusion diaphragm. Continuation of this expansion leads to formation of the fusion pore that allows for the transfer of aqueous contents 15 .\n\nIn addition to aiding in protein folding and stability, the TM domains of many viral envelope fusion proteins have been shown to have a role in fusion 16; 17; 18; 19; 20; 21; 22; 23; 24 . When the TM domain of influenza virus HA was replaced with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, it resulted in a fusion protein that could mediate hemifusion by allowing the transfer of a lipid but not aqueous fluorescent probe, suggesting a role of the TM domain in pore formation and enlargement. This GPI-anchored HA was embedded only in the outer leaflet of the membrane, and it was proposed that the TM domain, which spans the entire membrane, affects the positive curvature on the inner leaflet that would allow for pore formation 17; 19 . In addition, specific residues in the TM domain have been shown to be important for fusion of influenza virus HA 18 , VSV G 20 , HIV gp41 23; 24; 25 , and baculovirus GP64 21 It has a 25-residue hydrophobic segment (spanning from 485 to 509) that is somewhat longer than the typical hydrophobic length of 20 residues for a vertically inserted TM helix. The Nterminus of the predicted TM helix is devoid of sidechains such as Trp, Tyr, Arg, or Lys that typically anchor the end of the helix in the headgroup region of the bilayer, and the sidechains of the fifteen preceding residues are uncharged and can partition easily between bilayer and aqueous phases 26; 27 . This region forms the end of the coiled-coil HRB stalk and a short linker segment in the pre-fusion form of F. Finally, the C-terminal end of the TM helix is predicted to occur at the positively charged K510, but the seven-residues following this residue are predominantly hydrophobic amino acids. Thus, if K510 snorkels into the headgroup region, the TM helix might extend beyond this point. This finding is reminiscent of the TM helix of HIV gp41 23 , which contains an absolutely conserved and functionally essential positively charged residue within the hydrophobic region of the TM helix. In summary, the TM helix of F appears to be longer than usual and has an unusually large number of potential orientations in membranes; these features piqued our interest and in part motivated the present study.\n\nWe first asked whether the TM domain formed a well-defined helical bundle in the prefusion form of the protein. This is particularly important question, because TM helices of fusogenic proteins often have sequences known to mediate helix-helix association, such as the GXXXG motif, and mutation of these sequences sometimes, but not always, lead to proteins that are properly expressed but have impaired function 20; 28; 29 . CryoEM studies on the human immunodeficiency virus fusion protein (Env) differ as some reports indicate the TM domains of the fusion protein are apart, like the legs of a tripod 30; 31 , whereas other studies indicate the TM domains are together and form one helical bundle 32 . By singly substituting each residue of the TM domain with cysteines, we have examined the structure of the TM domain in the lipid membrane. The addition of an oxidative cross-linker and formation of disulfide bonds clearly showed that one face of the TM helix mediates the formation of a homomeric TM helical bundle, most likely a trimer. To address the role of specific residues within the TM helix we performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis, and determined that two residues, 486 and 488, are critical for PIV5 F fusion. The aggregate of analysis of the steps of fusion indicate these mutants do not support hemifusion and are trapped at the lipid stalk stage just prior to formation of the hemifusion diaphragm. Our results indicate a specific amino acid sequence of the TM domain is necessary for completion of fusion. The amino acid side chains at residues 486 and 488, which are predicted to be in the outer leaflet of the F TM domain, are critical for the merger of the two lipid membranes and fusion completion. The block in fusion observed with mutation of F residues 486 and 488 could be overcome by addition of compounds that affect the curvature of the membrane bilayer.\n\nThe TM domain is not part of the solved crystal structure of either the prefusion form of PIV5 F 7 or the postfusion form of hPIV3 F 6 . Although it is thought likely that the TM domain of F would be \u03b1-helical because the hydrophobic packing of an \u03b1-helix would aid in spanning a lipid bilayer, this has not been determined. It is also unknown if the TM domains of the PIV5 F monomers interact to form a trimer. It has been shown recently that TM peptides of influenza virus HA associate with each other in model membranes 33 . In the prefusion form of F, HRB forms a three-helix bundle (3HB) and HRB is separated from the TM domain by only seven residues. Therefore, it seems likely that the F TM domain monomers would be in close proximity in the membrane if not in a 3HB. We used oxidative disulfide cross-linking to examine the structure of the F TM domain. This method has been used to investigate the arrangement of TM domains for several membrane proteins, such as the Escherichia coli chemoreceptor 34; 35; 36 , the aspartate receptor 37 , the influenza virus M2 ion channel 38 , and CD39 39; 40 .\n\nThe PIV5 F protein contains 10 disulfide-bonded cysteine residues in the ectodomain and one free cysteine residue in the TM domain. This latter cysteine at residue 492 was mutated to serine, and single cysteine substitutions were made in the TM domain in this pseudo-wt Cysbackground. All mutants in the Cys-background were expressed at the cell surface equivalently to pseudo wt F (data not shown). The fusion activity of these mutants was determined by using the luciferase reporter gene assay (Fig. 2) . Most mutants showed fusion activity similar to pseudo wt (Cys -, C492S) and wt F protein (denoted as 492). Mutants 485, 486, 488, 497, 503 exhibited some decrease in fusion activity with the maximum reduction being \u223c50% for mutant 486 (see Fig. 2 ). Mutations in the TM domain of influenza virus HA have been shown to affect raft association 41 . However, none of the cysteine substitutions affected raft association of the F protein (data not shown).\n\nWe examined the effect of oxidative cross-linking of these F TM domain single cysteine substitutions. For each mutant, there are three available cysteines in each trimer. If these cysteines are oriented toward each other in the membrane and are within disulfide bondforming distance, two will form a disulfide bond and leave the third cysteine unbonded. On the other hand, if the helices are not specifically interacting one might expect that high concentrations of oxidants would be required to induce any disulfide formation in the membrane, and that there would be no clear pattern for forming disulfides between residues along any one face of the helix. In Fig. 3A are shown untreated F mutants analyzed under nonreducing conditions on a 3.5% SDS-PAGE gel. Disulfide bonds formed by air oxidation should occur only in the extracellular aqueous phase and the headgroup region of the outer leaflet of the bilayer 38 . Air oxidation is much slower in the hydrophobic region of the bilayer, and the reducing intracellular environment minimizes air oxidation on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Cysteine residues in the outer leaflet of the bilayer at positions 485, 486, 487, and 489 did form disulfide bonds, indicating the individual F TM domains are in close proximity to themselves and that these positions occur near the headgroup region of the outer leaflet of the bilayer.\n\nThe data are in very good agreement with the expected orientations of the TM helices, as inferred from deletion mutagenesis and crystallographic analysis of the protein. In the prefusion structure of F residues 446 to 476 form a three-stranded coiled coil; a short linker connects to the TM domain near residues 485. Four residues (481-484) can be deleted with full retention of function, while a two-residue deletion (483-484) caused a decrease in fusogenic activity 10; 42 . More strikingly, deletion of eight residues (477-484), which comprises the end of the coiled coil and the entire linker leads to nearly full retention of fusogenic activity, while deletion of only six residues (479-484) leads to a protein that is less well-expressed on the cell surface and highly inactive in fusion 10 . Interestingly, if the HRB coiled-coil continues into the TM region, the four-residue and eight-residue mutants would position the sidechains of residues 485 and 486 in close proximity, consistent with their high level of crosslinking in Fig. 3A . (See also Supplemental Fig. 2 ). On the other hand, there would be a strong mismatch between the axial rotation of the helical axes in the HRB coiled coil versus the TM bundle in the six-residue deletion mutant, explaining its lack of stability and function.\n\nCu(II)(1,10-phenanthroline) 3 (CuP) was used to induce disulfide cross-linking within the lipid interior 38; 43 , which are otherwise resistant to oxidation. When the F TM mutants were treated with 3 mM (final concentration) of CuP for 10 min at 37\u00b0C, more extensive disulfide crosslinking was observed (Fig. 3B ). Under conditions required to induce oxidation of the membrane-spanning regions, much more extensive cross-linking is observed in the aqueousaccessible region, (residues 485-491). Within the TM region, residues 493, 494, 496, 498, 501, 504, 506, and 508 all showed disulfide bond formation. 3 mM CuP was also added at 4\u00b0C, 10\u00b0C , and 22\u00b0C for 10 min (data not shown). All residues near the ectodomain (485-491, 493, 494) formed disulfide bonds at all temperatures, even 4\u00b0C. Mutants that formed disulfide bonds after treatment with 3 mM CuP for 10 min at 37\u00b0C also formed disulfide bonds when 3 mM CuP treatment was for 1 or 5 min (data not shown). The effect of cross-linking on fusion could not be determined after oxidation due to the toxicity of the CuP on the live cells that are required for the fusion assays (data not shown).\n\nCross-linking occurs in a pattern suggestive of a helical bundle. Even at a qualitative level, it is clear that the extent of crosslinking follows the same periodicity as that of an alpha-helix (approximately 3.6 residues/turn), suggesting that one face of the helix interacts in the core of a bundle. Furthermore, the extent of cross-linking under these conditions is similar to that observed with previously characterized membrane proteins of known three-dimensional structure, suggesting that the TM domain folds into a well-defined structure 38; 43 . One unusual feature, however, is that three consecutive residues near the outer leaflet of the bilayer (489-491) form crosslinks quite efficiently, suggesting some malleability in this region of the protein. To better determine the nature of the interface, the extent of disulfide cross-linking was quantified and fit to a sine wave. The raw CuP cross-linking data was normalized by dividing the amount of disulfide formed by the total amount of protein (disulfide linked plus not linked). The CuP data at 37\u00b0C was used for most of the TM domain, positions 492-509. Because cross-linking was stronger in the outer leaflet of the bilayer, low temperature (4\u00b0C) CuP data was used for residue positions 485-491 so that data from the two regions would be on the same scale (and to maintain linearity of the image plate response to radioactivity). This type of approach was previously used to model the structure of the TM domain of the influenza virus M2 protein 38 , where a similar level of cross-linking was observed.\n\nIt was considered that the disulfide cross-linking could occur between two trimers. However, when over 100-fold different amounts of F protein were expressed, there was no change in the level of cross-linking as would be expected to occur for inter-trimer cross-links (data not shown). In addition, higher molecular weight species of trimer-trimer formation, in addition to cross-links within a trimer were not observed on gels (data not shown). Further, the extensive nature of the cross-links for some mutants and not others argues for cross-links within the TM domains within a trimer.\n\nExamination of the F TM domain data showed that the crosslinking efficiency oscillated as a function of the sequence position with approximately the same periodicity as the alpha-helix (3.6 residues/turn). However, G497 deviated from this trend, showing a lower degree of crosslinking than expected. Given the unusual characteristics of glycine residues, residue 497 was removed from the calculation and separate fits made to the data before and after this residue. The periodicity was also indicative of a helical conformation (residues 485-496: 3.65 \u00b1 0.18 residues/turn, residues 498-509: 3.40 \u00b1 0.21 residues/turn, Fig. 3C ). The pattern is interrupted by the insertion of one residue near residue 497. Thus, the fit parameters suggest a packed helical TM interface made up of residues 486, 489, 493, 501, 504, and 508 (circled in Fig. 3B ) with a potential distortion to the helix around residue 497.\n\nTo create models for the TM region, we assume it forms a trimeric bundle, and that efficient cross-linking occurred only at residues close together in the three-dimensional structure. One way to allow insertion of a single residue into alpha-helices is by inserting a pi-bulge 44; 45 . Fig. 3D shows an example of a three-fold symmetric bundle created by using the backbone of a TM helix containing a pi bulge from the Na-dependent aspartate transporter structure (pdb 2nwl, 2.96 \u00c5, 46 ). The sequence of the TM region of F was threaded onto this backbone, and Gly497 was positioned within the pi-bulge. The effect of a pi-bulge on the positioning of the residues that crosslink efficiently (when mutated to Cys) can be seen by comparing it to the result expected for an ideal helix and without a pi bulge (Fig. 3D ). The pi bulge allows both the interfaces above and below the bulge to occur on the same face of the helix. A bundle was created from this helix by applying C3 symmetry followed by energy minimization (Fig. 3E) .\n\nA second way insertions are accommodated in coiled coils is by variation of the helix-packing in a common structural motif known as a \"stutter\" 47 . A geometric model incorporating this insertion was created by correlating the cross-linking data with the C \u03b1 distances of the trimeric coiled-coil from influenza virus HA. As the stutters in HA result in different local distortions 48 , pre-and postfusion HA structures 49; 50 were searched for one that matched the cross-linking data as described in Supplemental Methods. Threading the sequence of the TM helix onto this backbone template gave a model in good qualitative agreement with the crosslinking data (Fig. 3F ). In summary, the crosslinking data show good evidence to support the formation of a 3HB, and stereochemically reasonable bundles can be constructed that are consistent with the data.\n\nTo determine the role of the F protein TM domain in fusion, alanine-scanning mutagenesis was performed in groups of two or three amino acids for the 25 residues of the PIV5 F protein TM domain. Further, the entire TM domain was replaced en bloc with 25 leucine residues (Fig.  4A ). Cell surface expression of the F protein mutants TM01-TM09 was equivalent to wild type (wt) PIV5 F (Table 1) . However, mutant TM10 was not expressed at the cell surface and thus F TM10 is likely to be a malfolded protein that is not transported through the exocytic pathway to the cell surface 51 . Previously, when the TM domain of PIV5 HN was replaced with leucine residues, there was no discernable effect on the cell surface expression of HN and no effect on its biological function 52 . The ability of the F TM domain alanine scanning mutants to cause cell-cell fusion was determined by using three assays: (1) syncytia formation, (2) a luciferase reporter assay and (3) a dye transfer assay. F TM domain mutants TM03-TM09 formed similar sized syncytia as compared to wt F protein, but mutant F proteins TM01 and TM02 did not cause syncytia formation although these proteins were well expressed at the cell surface (Fig.  4B ). Whereas several of the TM mutants showed some decrease in fusion in the quantitative luciferase reporter and dye transfer assays, TM01 and TM02 caused a consistent and major reduction in fusion in all assays used ( Fig. 4C and D).\n\nTo determine further which residues in mutants TM01 and TM02 are responsible for the greatly reduced fusion activity, the first five residues, 485-489, of the F protein TM domain were changed individually to alanine. All these mutants were expressed at the cell surface at levels similar to wt F (Table 1) . F TM domain mutants V485A, S487A, and I489A formed syncytia at levels similar to wt F, but F TM domain mutants L486A and I488A did not cause syncytia formation (Fig. 5A ). These mutants also showed a substantial decrease in fusion in the luciferase reporter and dye transfer assays (Fig. 5B, C) . In all cases where fusion occurred, both the lipidic dye, R18 (data not shown), and the aqueous content mixing dye, 6-CF, were transferred to the CV-1 cells, whereas F TM domain mutants L486A and I488A did not cause the transfer of R18 or 6-CF. Thus, these mutants do not cause either lipid mixing or contents mixing. Previously, we determined that an increase in temperature can be a surrogate for HN triggering fusion 8; 53 . To examine temperature dependent triggering of the F TM domain mutants RBCs were labeled with 6-CF and bound to effector CV-1 cells expressing HN and F proteins and labeled with SYTO-17 at 4\u00b0C. The target-effector complexes were then incubated at 29\u00b0C, 37\u00b0C, or 42\u00b0C for 15 min, and the number of fusion events was measured by confocal microscopy (Fig. 5C ). For wt F, the number of dye transfer events increased with increasing temperature. The amount of fusion mediated by F TM domain mutants L486A and I488A increased between 29\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C, but increasing the temperature beyond 37\u00b0C did not enhance fusion. The mutants L486A and I488A did not exhibit a hemifusion phenotype, i.e. transfer of the lipidic dye R18 to target cells in the absence of transfer of the aqueous dye 6-CF. It is possible that these mutations either stabilize the F protein and prevent F protein from attaining its lowest energy postfusion conformation or affect protein/membrane interactions that stabilize an intermediate in the fusion pathway. For example these mutant F proteins may be trapped at a folding/fusion intermediate that cannot be overcome by an increase in temperature.\n\nFor PIV5 entry into cells by fusion, HN binds to its ligand, sialic acid, and by an unknown process begins the activation of F. The earliest stage of fusion that has been determined was inferred from functional properties of the N-1 peptide (which is derived from the HRA region of F). N-1 peptide can bind to the HRB region of F after HN has bound to target cells at 4\u00b0C and inhibits fusion 8 . Based on the atomic structure of prefusion F this step in fusion has been called the open-stalk conformation with the HRB helices melting and breaking the interactions at the base of the head but leaving the head domain largely intact 7 . To determine if F TM domain mutants L486A and I488A can attain the F open-stalk conformation, a modified N-1 peptide, N-1-HAt, was synthesized that contains an 11 residue HA tag (YPYDVPDYASL) at the C-terminus of N-1. Peptide binding was determined by the ability of the HA tag MAb to immunoprecipitate wt F protein. It was found that the N-1-HAt bound to F at 4\u00b0C when target RBCs containing the HN receptor sialic acid were present but N-1-HAt did not bind to F as well in the absence of target RBCs. (Fig. 6A) . To test if F TM domain mutants L486A and I488A reached the open-stalk stage of fusion, N-1-HAt peptide was incubated with cells expressing HN and one of the mutant F proteins at 4\u00b0C in the presence of 0.5% hematocrit target RBCs (Fig. 6B) . The HA tag MAb 12CA5 was used to immunoprecipitate the F protein containing bound peptide, and the total F in the lysate was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody specific for F protein. N-1-HAt bound to wt F and F TM domain mutants L486A, and I488A, and the band for these mutants was generally more intense than that of the wt. This observation indicates the HRB region was accessible in all F proteins, and that the alanine substitutions in the TM domain might stabilize somewhat the formation of the openstalk conformation of F protein.\n\nThe second known step in the F protein refolding event after formation of the open stalk intermediate is thought to be that HRA refolds and the fusion peptide is inserted into the target cell membrane to form the pre-hairpin intermediate 7; 8 . At this stage of fusion, the C-1 peptide, derived from the HRB region of F, specifically inhibits PIV5 F-mediated fusion 54 by binding in the grooves on the outside of the HRA coiled-coil 10 . To capture the pre-hairpin conformation the C-1 peptide was used in an RBC retention assay 8 . To examine the F TM domain mutants for pre-hairpin formation, target RBCs labeled with 6-CF were bound at 4\u00b0C to CV-1 cells that co-expressed F and HN and were labeled with STYO 17. When the RBCs that have bound at 4\u00b0C to the CV-1 cell are warmed to 37\u00b0C, the majority of RBCs either fuse or are released due to the neuraminidase activity of HN that is active at 37\u00b0C but not at 4\u00b0C 8; 55 . In the presence of C-1 peptide the F protein forms the pre-hairpin intermediate and the RBCs remain bound to the CV-1 cells because the fusion peptide has inserted into the RBC membrane but further refolding is blocked and fusion is inhibited 8 . Addition of C-1 peptide did not affect the number of RBCs bound at 4\u00b0C (Fig. 6C) . However, when cells expressing F TM domain mutants L486A and I488A with bound RBCs were warmed to 37\u00b0C in the absence of C-1 peptide, there was a near complete loss of bound RBCs, suggesting that these mutants are not trapped at the prehairpin intermediate (Fig. 6C ). To determine if these mutants reached the pre-hairpin intermediate or are unable to transition between the open-stalk conformation and the prehairpin intermediate, 40 \u03bcM C-1 peptide was added. At 37\u00b0C there was an increase in the number of RBCs retained as compared to L486A and I488A at 37\u00b0C without the addition of peptide, although the number was not as large as for wt F (Fig. 6C) . These data indicate that the F TM domain mutants form the pre-hairpin intermediate, but the reproducible lower amount of C-1 binding for mutants L486A and I486A could indicate some impairment in pre-hairpin formation for these two mutants.\n\nMAb 6-7 only recognizes the postfusion conformation of the F protein and not the prefusion conformation of the F protein 8; 53; 56 . Thus, MAb 6-7 can be used to determine if F TM mutants L486A and I488A undergo the F protein refolding event that accompanies membrane fusion. It was found that although F TM domain mutants L486A and I488A cause greatly decreased fusion as compared to wt F and TM domain mutants L486I and I488L, wt F and the four mutants F proteins exhibited the same MAb 6-7 reactivity at 4\u00b0C, 40\u00b0C, 43\u00b0C, 47\u00b0C, and 50\u00b0C as determined by flow cytometry, supporting the notion that the F protein TM domain mutants can proceed through the known intermediates of fusion and that they have a conformation closely related to postfusion F, even though L486A and L488A are essentially fusion inactive (Fig. 6D) . Thus, although the steady state concentrations of the pre-hairpin intermediate might be affected by these mutations, the extent and rate of conversion to the postfusion form recognized by MAB 6-7 would appear to be essentially that same as that of wt.\n\nIt has been shown previously that a mutant of the W3A isolate of PIV5, S443P, demonstrates a lower temperature requirement for fusion activation, faster fusion kinetics, and independence of HN activation 53 . Because for F S443P extensive syncytia formation occurs at room temperature in the absence of HN co-expression, F S443P and related mutants 57 have been termed hyperfusogenic. It is thought that F mutation S443P destabilizes the interactions between the top of the HRB three-helix bundle and the linker to the IgG-like Domain II 7 hence lowering the energy barrier for conversion to the open stalk conformation. Two other hyperfusogenic mutants that lower the temperature requirement for fusion and enable HNindependent fusion are Gly to Ala mutations in the fusion peptide G105A (previously referred to as G3A) and G109A (G7A) 58; 59 . Both mutations are highly destabilizing: the G109A not only destabilizes the F protein on cell surface expression but also inactivates the F protein relatively quickly and inactivates F for fusion if target cells are not present 59 .\n\nIt seemed possible that if F TM domain mutants are blocked in causing fusion at a stage beyond the pre-hairpin intermediate then incorporation of a hyperfusogenic mutation into the TM domain mutants might overcome the fusion block, probably due to the increased kinetics of fusion that is thought to be caused by triggering a greater number of F trimers at any one time. The L486A and I488A mutations were introduced into three hyperfusogenic backgrounds, S443P, G105A, and G109A F, to create the double mutants S443P/L486A, S443P/I488A, G105A/L486A, G105A/I488A, G109A/L486A, and G109A/I488A (Fig. 7) . The F double mutants were expressed in HeLa CD4 LTR \u03b2gal cells and cell surface abundance determined by flow cytometry. S443P/L486A, S443P/I488A, G105A/L486A and G105A/I488A were surface expressed similarly to wt F whereas the surface expression of G109A, G109A/L486A, and G109A/I488A was only 10% of wt F (Table 1) . Expression in BHK-21F cells showed that F mutants S443P/L486A, S443P/I488A, G109A/L486A, and G109A/I488A exhibited extensive syncytia formation (hyperfusogenic) and syncytia formation was independent of HN expression (data not shown). F G105A/L486A and F G105A/I488A showed higher levels of syncytia formation than F L486A and F I488A but less than F G109A protein consistent with earlier data for F mutant G105A 59 . Thus, whereas F TM mutants L486A and I488A cannot cause fusion, the addition of the hyperfusogenic mutants to create double mutants lowers the energy barrier to fusion and overcomes the block to fusion caused by the L486A and I488A mutations. These data indicate that the F TM domain mutations L486A and I488A have not caused the F proteins to convert to an inactive \"spent\" conformation and the F TM mutant proteins have not veered off the fusion pathway. It may be that increasing the number of active F molecules increases the probability of a successful fusion event -perhaps the membrane state and the number of active F molecules are parameters that interact in a manner unknown to determine a successful outcome. Alternatively, the \"lifetime\" of the prehairpin intermediate may be different between mutant and wt, and the presence of a greater number of active F molecules could enhance the probability of successful fusion. This second explanation is also consistent with the peptide-pulldown results (Fig. 6) .\n\nChanging the curvature of the membrane rescues fusion of F TM domain mutants L486A and I488A\n\nIn addition to the F protein conformational intermediates of fusion, the changes occurring in the lipid bilayers can be broken down into several intermediates. It is thought that formation of the F protein six helix bundle brings the membranes of the virus and the target cell together 8; 10 and exclusion of water molecules permits formation of the hemifusion stalk. This stalk is an initial lipid connection between the proximal membrane leaflets 60 . The stalk then expands to form the hemifusion diaphragm, which is a single bilayer segment, before the fusion pore forms 60 . Lipids can affect membrane fusion based on their molecular shape. The cone shaped lipid stearoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) has a positive spontaneous curvature, which is predicted to hinder the transition to hemifusion when present in the outer bilayer. The cone shaped lipid oleic acid (OA) has a negative spontaneous curvature, which favors hemifusion when present in the outer bilayer 61 . The addition of LPC and OA to cells expressing HN and F proteins has been shown previously to inhibit and favor an increase in fusion, respectively 8 . To examine whether addition of cone shaped lipids would overcome the block in fusion of F TM domain mutants LPC was added to CV-1 cells expressing HN and wt F, F L486A, or F I488A prior to and during binding of R18-and 6-CF-labeled RBCs at 4\u00b0C. On warming to 37\u00b0C neither lipid mixing (R18 transfer) nor cytoplasmic content mixing (6-CF transfer) occurred between the RBCs and the CV-1 effector cells (Fig. 8A ). In contrast, addition of OA to the effector cells not only increased wt F fusion, but also caused a significant increase in lipid and contents fusion for F TM mutants L486A and I488A (Fig. 8A) . Chlorpromazine (CPZ), a drug that causes positive curvature of the lipid bilayer, ruptures the hemifusion diaphragm and causes pore formation 61 . The addition of CPZ to effector cells did not cause an increase in lipid or contents fusion for F TM domain mutants L486A or I488A (Fig. 8B) \n\nIf the TM region of F plays an active role in stabilizing the lipid stalk or other lipidic intermediates, then one might expect the nature of the residues near the headgroup region to have a profound effect on fusion. Therefore, further substitutions were made at F TM domain residues 486 and 488 to test how the distinct potentials of different amino acid side chains to partition into different regions of the membrane 26; 62; 63 would affect fusion activity. L486 and I488 were each substituted with I/L, V, F, C, A, G, T, W, or Y (Fig. 9) . I, L, V and F are residues that prefer to be buried deep in a bilayer, experiencing a favorable free energy of transfer from water to the bilayer center. By contrast, C, A, G, and T, show relatively flat potential profiles, indicating that transfer to the bilayer is neither strongly favored nor disfavored. Finally, W and Y have a strong tendency to localize in the headgroup region of the bilayer, relative to either the bilayer center or the aqueous phase. The fusion activity of each of the mutants expressed in Vero cells was determined using a luciferase gene reporter assay. Fusion activity was severely decreased (less than 50% of wt F) for residue 486 or 488 substitutions A, G, T, W, and Y. Substitution for C yielded \u223c60% to 80% fusion, and substitutions for I/L, V, and F showed no difference in fusion activity as compared to wt F protein (Fig. 9A) .\n\nWhen the fusion activity was plotted against the hydrophobicity index of each residue 64 , those amino acid residues with a hydrophobicity index below 2 (A, G, T, W and Y) show decreased fusion whereas those amino acid residues with a higher hydrophobicity index exhibited wt F protein fusion activity (Supplemental Fig. 1) . The E(z) potential was used to test further how the substitutions would affect the propensity of the TM sequence to insert into a bilayer 26 . This potential, which is based on a statistical analysis of the crystallographic database of 153 membrane proteins 65 , defines the potential for a given residue to reside at various depths in the membrane, and it is useful for determining which regions of a TM domain have the greatest preference to reside in specific regions of the bilayer. Fig. 9B shows a plot of the E(z) potential scores generated by computing the mean score for successive 20-residue segments across the sequence. The results are plotted for the average, and for segments with scores plus or minus a single standard deviation from the mean. In each case the sequences funnel down to a relatively sharp minimum. Because each point reflects the score for a 20-residue sequence, the minimum identifies the 20-residue segment with the highest propensity to lie vertical to the bilayer surface. This figure also compares the profiles of the F protein with that for the other two integral membrane proteins of the paramyxovirus PIV5 (SH and HN) 66; 67 , and the M2 proton channel of influenza A virus 68 , the latter which contains both a TM helix as well as a C-terminal cytoplasmic helical segment (Fig. 9C) . The sequences of SH, HN, and M2 funnel in the usual manner, and 20-30 residue stretches are observed with a high propensity to span the bilayer. Interestingly, however, the F protein sequence shows an unusually broad minimum, indicative of a much more extended sequence with some propensity to lie within the bilayer. This property is conserved among the paramyxovirus F proteins tested (measles virus, mumps virus, Newcastle disease virus and human parainfluenza viruses 2 and 3) although the profile for PIV5 is the broadest (Supplemental Fig. 3 ). For PIV5 F the absolute minimum in the curve suggests the TM helix begins at residue 485 in good agreement with the air-oxidation cross-linking data, showing this to be near the headgroup region. However, with a very small energetic cost, the native TM helical bundle could translocate up or down through the membrane, or lie at an oblique angle.\n\nInterestingly, the scores for a 15 contiguous points N-terminal minimum lies within one standard deviation of the mean value for the databank TM helices. This region includes a portion of the membrane-proximal end of the crystallographically defined structure of the HRB. Fig. 9D illustrates the effects of the mutations on the cumulative E(z) potential score for the N-terminal region for the mutations at residues 486 and 488. To help visualize the effects, the graphs were computed for double-mutants, but the same trends hold for the individual mutants. The mutations change the 20 residue window of the protein with the most membrane favorable sequence. Instead of the 20 residue window 485-504 being the most membrane favorable, the best window becomes 493-512. Additionally, with the exception of Trp, all the mutations have the effect of moving the most membrane suitable 20 residue window from 485-504 in the wild type to 493-512 in the mutants. Clearly other regions of the protein are important for determining the boundary of the TM helix so it is difficult to interpret this as a literal movement of the TM in the resting state. Nevertheless, if helical movements are important for the fusion mechanism, these changes would upset the energetics of fusion. Fig.  9E shows an atomistic model of the proposed extended TM domain region of PIV5 F. The canonical TM is shown in green, while the N-terminal (blue) and C-terminal (red) regions that are more suitable for the membrane than one standard deviation above the mean are also shown. The extended TM domain region is expected to be more suitable for the membrane than any window in 24 of the 153 TM domain sequences 26 .\n\nFor ion channel proteins that have multiple TM spanning domains, atomic structure determinations have enabled a distinction between those TM \u03b1-helices that serve architectural structural roles and those that act as the aqueous pore/ionic selectivity filter 69 . For the homotetrameric influenza virus M2 proton-selective ion channel protein each polypeptide chain only spans the membrane once and the single hydrophobic domain found in each polypeptide chain has to act as the endoplasmic reticulum membrane insertion sequence, the membrane anchoring sequence and the pore and gate of the channel 38; 68; 70; 71; 72 . However, for the majority of integral membrane proteins that span a membrane once, the role of the TM domain besides being a membrane anchorage domain is largely unknown.\n\nFor many viral proteins that mediate membrane fusion, mutagenesis studies on the TM domain have yielded a wide variety of results. However, the preponderance of data indicates that the TM domain of these fusion proteins is not simply a string of hydrophobic amino acids that spans a lipid bilayer but there is amino acid sequence specificity to the TM domain, implying specific roles of TM domain amino acid residues in fusion protein function. Specificity of amino acid residue implies specific structural features or interactions of these TM domain residues with the lipid bilayers and thus a direct role of amino acid side chains in the process of membrane fusion, and further implying that membrane fusion is not simply a solely lipidic event.\n\nTo study the features of the paramyxovirus PIV5 F protein TM domain for membrane fusion activity alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used. The F protein TM domain was found to exhibit sequence dependence for fusion activity and it was also observed that a block of 20 leucine residues could not substitute for the entire PIV5 F TM domain even to obtain cell surface expression of F. Upon further substitution, residues L486 and I488 were found to play a key role in fusion, where altering the hydrophobicity of the side chain at these residues profoundly affected fusion activity (Fig. 9A) . Although F mutants L486A and I488A were deficient for fusion, biological activity could be rescued by the addition of the destabilizing mutations F S443P, F G105A, or F G109A (Fig. 7) , indicating F L486A and I488A were not trapped in an intermediate conformation nor had the mutant F proteins veered irreversibly off the fusion pathway. It is generally thought that F-mediated membrane fusion requires the action of several trimers and the hyperfusion phenotype of destabilizing mutants may be due to more synchronous F activation events in an otherwise stochastic process. Thus, addition of a destabilizing mutation to F proteins that are blocked for fusion may simply alter the lifetimes of conformational intermediates, driving the fusion process by mass action. Detailed analysis indicated F L486A and F I488A form the prefusion conformation of F, the open-stalk intermediate, the pre-hairpin intermediate, and F can be converted to a conformation that is close to, or at the post-fusion form ( Fig. 1 A-D) . As discussed above the precise timing of the conversion of the prehairpin conformation to the postfusion form with the formation of the lipid intermediates is not known, but refolding of F may occur across all the lipid intermediate stages. Evidence from studies of HIV gp120/gp41 suggest some 6HB formation occurs after a pore has formed 13; 73 Thus, it seemed likely that the block in fusion for the F L486A and F I488A proteins corresponds to their inability to complete the lipidic stages of fusion (Fig. 1C-D) . The data obtained using OA to confer negative spontaneous curvature of the membrane and concomitantly causing a large increase in fusion activity of F L486A and F I488A indicates that fusion is delayed/arrested at the lipid stalk intermediate (Fig. 1 panels f-i) . These findings suggest that the TM domain might play an active role in the lipidic steps in fusion, as discussed previously 16; 17; 18; 19 . In fusion, the formation of the 6HB and the postfusion form of F brings together the TM domain and the FP, which excludes water between the membranes, and this local dehydration allows for membrane contact 2 . There is a high-energy requirement for the presumptive next stage, the lipid stalk 74 .\n\nOne goal of this work was to define the structural features of the TM domain and to relate these to potential roles in the mechanism of fusion. The available atomic structures of ion channel proteins indicate that the multiple TM domains are mostly \u03b1-helical 69 and for the very few known viral proteins, the structures of the TM domains of integral membrane proteins are \u03b1helical 71;72;75 . Even less is known as to whether the TM \u03b1-helices are together in the membrane forming helical bundles or whether each \u03b1-helix is separate from the others. Clearly for the influenza virus M2 ion channel the TM domains form a four-helix bundle 71; 72 . CryoEM studies on the human immunodeficiency virus fusion protein (Env) differ as some reports indicate the TM domains of the fusion protein are apart, like the legs of a tripod 30; 31 , whereas other studies indicate the TM domains are together and form one helical bundle 32 . The substitution of F TM domain residues with cysteine and cross-linking induced by air oxidation confirmed the N-terminal boundary of the TM in the membrane, and treatment with CuP indicates the TM domains in the F trimer form a TM helical bundle. Further, the extensive cross-linking of residues in the outer leaflet of the bilayer suggests that in this region the helices have significant flexibility or are only partially folded, thereby allowing three consecutive residues to become very highly cross-linked (Fig. 3B) . Quantification of the extent of disulfide bond formation and modeling studies indicate that the data fit best a model in which the F TM domain forms a 3HB within the membrane. A break in the regular 7-residue period seen for coiled coils, suggest that a residue was inserted near the center of the bilayer resulting in either a pi bulge at residues 497-500 (Fig. 3D ,E) or a \"stutter\" geometry ( Fig 3F) . The PIV5 TM domain contains glycine at residues 494 and 497, but they do not appear to be essential to function or to mediate tight inter-helical interactions. Residue L486 is predicted to be at the interface of the 3HB although the fusion data (in the presence of oleic acid) indicate this residue is likely to interact with the lipids of the bilayer. Presumably, the structural malleability that enables the residues close to the ectodomain to form disulfide bonds also enables residue L486 to populate different conformations that either face the interior of the predicted 3HB or interact with the lipid bilayer.\n\nThe energy necessary to form the lipid stalk may be derived from the fusion protein, which may generate bilayer stresses that are relaxed by forming the stalk intermediate 2 . For PIV5 F protein, the outer leaflet residues L486 and I488 may facilitate the negative curvature of the outer lipid leaflet that is necessary to merge the two bilayers, and residues with higher hydrophobicity may provide a more negative curvature (Fig. 1C-D) .\n\nThe long potential length of the TM sequence of paramyxovirus F proteins ( Fig. 9 and Supplemental Fig.3 ) suggests an additional possible role for this domain in fusion. The length would allow the helix to move dynamically into different orientations and/or lie at extreme angles in the membrane. In this work, the extra-viral end of the TM helix in the resting state was inferred from the Cys cross-linking as well as the E(z) potential, which were in good agreement. However, if this were the only orientation sampled by the helix during fusion then mutation of residue I488 to Trp should not negatively impact function because it would be on the exposed face of the 3HB located in the headgroup region, where Trp is quite stabilizing. If, however, dynamic changes in the orientation within the bilayer were required, then this anchoring substituent would upset the energetic balance between the states adopted along the reaction coordinate. Given that the mutants appear to be defective in lipid stalk formation, and that the TM helix has a hydrophobic region both preceding and following it, we consider it possible that the TM region might act as a template to stabilize the lipid stalk intermediate. The N-terminal hydrophobic extension would encourage the diffusion of lipids out of the outer leaflet of the bilayer and along the stalk-like template, and initiating the formation of the lipid stalk (Fig. 10) . Decreasing the hydrophobicity of the protein by mutating I488 or L486 to less polar residues, or stabilizing the initial configuration by inclusion of Trp and Tyr would increase the energetic cost of translocation of the helix through the membrane and migration of lipids up the stalk.\n\nFurthermore, the hydrophobic stretch at the cytoplasmic C-terminus of the TM helix might allow the TM 3HB to translocate outward, extending the length of the exposed patch on the extracellular side of the bilayer (Fig. 10) . Our calculations and experimental results suggest that the energy of the system is finely balanced, allowing this translocation to occur at minimal energetic cost. In the resting state, the TM bundle is stably inserted in the bilayer, but vertical translocations within the bilayer should occur at a relatively small energetic cost due to the lack of N-terminal anchoring residues and the hydrophobicity of the residues on both sides of the TM helix. Importantly, hairpin formation might provide a strong driving force for translocation of the TM helices in the bilayer. This conformational transition has the net affect of pulling the FP and the TM helix (located in opposing bilayers) towards one another, effectively applying a mechanical force favoring translocation of the N-terminus of the TM helix out of the bilayer, and the C-terminus of the TM helix deeper into the bilayer. The concomitant increase in length of the hydrophobic N-terminal extra-cellular region would provide a greater surface to serve as a template for non-bilayer lipidic intermediates. Finally, we note that in the pre-hairpin intermediate the 3HB of HRA has a very hydrophobic surface prior to docking of the HRB helix and formation of the water-soluble post-fusion six-helix bundle. Thus, the 3HB of HRA could serve a similar role to encourage the initiation of a lipidcoated stalk projecting from the target cell's membrane.\n\nIt is possible that as the last stage in the F protein refolding event the TM domain interacts with the FP and forms another 6HB. The process of converting prehairpin F to the postfusion form of F may provide the necessary energy to exclude the water between the membranes and form the lipid intermediates (Fig. 1C-D) . At the first stage of fusion, the outer leaflets of the two bilayers have just merged but have not mixed (hemifusion). The TM domain and FP may still be segregated in separate bilayers, and the interaction between the TM domain and FP could drive the formation of the hemifusion intermediate. Hyperfusogenic mutants G105A and G109A are located within the FP. These two mutants rescue fusion of L486A and I488A (Fig.  7) . Although hypothesized previously that these destabilizing mutants G105A and G109A may cause hyperfusion by lowering the energy necessary to drive the various fusion intermediates 59 it is also possible that these FP mutants affect the potential interaction with the TM domain and destabilize and lower the energy requirement to mix the bilayers and drive the hemifusion intermediate and form the fusion pore ( Fig. 9C-D) .\n\nIn summary the results presented here demonstrate that the TM helix of F plays an active role in fusion. It forms a well-defined TM bundle, and subtle modulations to its sequence give rise to large changes in activity. We further suggest that its unusual sequence characteristics might allow it to play an active role in templating the formation of the lipid stalk intermediate. We note that other proteins such as HIV gp41 also show unusually long hydrophobic TM helices, and changing its physical properties strongly impacts fusion 23 . Additionally, Dengue E protein (a class II fusion protein) has two TM helices, one of which has a long membrane suitable region that has an E(z) score one deviation from the average of 153 TM domains (Supplemental Fig. 4A ). VSV (class III) has a single TM helix that that also has a long membrane suitable region (Supplemental Fig. 4B ). Although fusion is intrinsically a complex process with multiple transition states it would appear that viral fusogenic proteins share not only similar structures and conformational changes, but they might also specifically stabilize well-defined intermediates in the fusion pathway.\n\nBHK-21F, Vero, BSR T7/5, CV-1, and HeLa CD4 LTR \u03b2gal cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). BHK-21F cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% tryptose phosphate broth, and HeLa CD4 LTR \u03b2gal cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 200 \u03bcg/ml geneticin, 100 \u03bcg/ml hygromycin B, and 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4. The recombinant vaccinia virus (vTF7-3) that expresses T7 RNA polymerase was grown in CV-1 cells as described previously 76 . pCAGGS and pGEM2X plasmids encoding PIV5 F, PIV5 HN, and PIV5 S443P F have been described previously 53 . pCAGGS plasmids encoding PIV5 G105A and G107A F have also been previously described 58; 59 . PIV5 F proteins containing TM domain amino acid residue substitutions were made by four-primer PCR with Tgo DNA polymerase and then by cloning into pCAGGS PIV5 F and pGEM2X PIV5 F. Plasmids encoding the double substitutions were made by subcloning pCAGGS L486A and I488A F into pCAGGS plasmids encoding S443P, G105A, or G107A F. Mutations were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing using an Applied Biosystems 3100-Avant automated DNA sequencer.\n\nPIV5 F and HN cDNAs cloned in the pCAGGS vector were expressed in BHK-21F, Vero, and HeLa CD4 LTR \u03b2gal cells by transient transfection using the Lipofectamine Plus expression system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected Vero cells were incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0C before the addition of DMEM containing 2% FBS and incubated a further 18 h at 37\u00b0C. PIV5 F and HN cDNAs in the pGEM2X vector were expressed using the recombinant vaccinia virus-T7 RNA polymerase transient expression system (vac T7) 76 . CV-1 cells in 6-well dishes containing glass coverslides were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 plaque forming units (pfu) with vTF7-3 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The cells were then transfected with 1.0 \u03bcg each of pGEM2X F and HN DNA using liposomes prepared as previously described 77 . After 4 h at 37\u00b0C, DMEM with 10% FBS was added and cells were incubated at 33\u00b0C overnight.\n\nMonolayers of BHK-21F cells in 6-well plates were transfected with 1.0 \u03bcg each of pCAGGS PIV5 F and HN DNA as described above. At 20 h post-transfection (p.t.), cells were fixed and stained using a Hema 3 stain (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) according to manufacturer's instructions, and photographs were taken using a with a digital camera (DCS 760, Kodak, Rochester, NY) attached to an inverted phase-contrast microscope (Diaphot, Nikon, Melville, NY).\n\nTo quantify cell-cell fusion, a luciferase reporter gene assay was performed as previously described 57 . Briefly, Vero cell monolayers in 6-well plates were transfected with 1.0 \u03bcg each of three plasmids, luciferase control DNA expressing the T7 promoter (Promega, Madison, WI), pCAGGS PIV5 F, and pCAGGS PIV HN. At 16 h p.t., BSR T7/5 cells expressing the T7 RNA polymerase were overlaid onto the Vero cells and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 6 h. The monolayers were then washed, lysed, and clarified by centrifugation per the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). For each sample, 150 \u03bcl of lysate was loaded into a 96-well plate. The luciferase activity of each lysate was quantified using 150 \u03bcl luciferase assay substrate (Promega) and an Lmax luminescence microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).\n\nHuman red blood cells (RBCs) were singly labeled with the aqueous dye 6-carboxyfluoroscein (CF, Invitrogen) or dual labeled with 6-CF and the lipid probe octadecyl rhodamine F chloride (R18, Invitrogen). CV-1 cells grown on glass cover slides and F and HN expressed using the vac T7 expression system. To visualize effector cells when using singly labeled RBCs, CV-1 cells were labeled with 1 \u03bcM SYTO-17 nucleic acid dye (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Analysis of lipid and aqueous dye transfer was performed as previously described 57 . Fusion was quantified by counting positive cells by using a scanning confocal microscope (LSM 5 Pascal, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc., Thornwood, NY) and averaging the fusion events obtained from three separate fields. For HN-independent retention of RBCs, SYTO-17 CV-1 cells were incubated with 0.1% hematocrit 6-CF labeled RBCs. Following incubation with RBCs, cells were either incubated at 4\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C for 15 min. During this warming stage, 40 \u03bcM C-1 peptide was added to some of the samples. C-1 peptide was expressed in bacteria and purified as previously described 54 . For the temperature dependence of dye transfer, samples were incubated at 29\u00b0C, 37\u00b0C, and 42\u00b0C for 15 min after the binding of target RBCs. For dye transfer experiments using the addition of lipids, fresh solutions of 10 \u03bcM lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Birmingham, AL) or 10 \u03bcM oleic acid (OA) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in PBS were made. After binding R18/6-CF dual labeled RBCs as above, CV-1 cells were incubated in cold LPC and OA solutions for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. The temperature was then shifted to 37\u00b0C by changing the bathing solution with new PBS containing LPC or OA prewarmed to 37\u00b0C and plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 min as above. For dye transfer experiments with chlorpromazine (CPZ) (Sigma), cells were prepared and R18/6-CF RBCs were bound as above. After raising the temperature to 37\u00b0C for 15 min., 0.5 mM CPZ in PBS was added to the CV-1 cells for 1 min. Cells were extensively washed with PBS without drug.\n\nTo quantify cell surface expression and to determine the protein conformation of the F protein, monolayers of HeLa CD4 LTR \u03b2gal cells in 6-well plates were transfected with 1.0 \u03bcg of pCAGGS PIV5 F DNA as described above and flow cytometry was performed as previously described using FITC-labeled secondary antibody 78 . For surface expression, the monoclonal antibody (mAb) F1a 79 was used at 1:100 dilution. To examine conformational rearrangements in the F protein, mAb 6-7 80 was used at 1:30 dilution. Prior to the addition of mAb 6-7, warmed PBS was added to the samples and the plates were incubated at 40\u00b0C, 43\u00b0C, 47\u00b0C or 50\u00b0C for 10 min and washed with cold PBS. The fluorescence intensity of 10,000 cells was measured by using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ).\n\nMonolayers of HeLa CD4 LTR \u03b2gal cells in 6 cm dishes were transfected with 2.0 \u03bcg each of pCAGGS PIV5 F and HN DNA as described above. At 18 h p.t., cells were starved with cysteine (Cys)-and methionine (Met)-deficient DMEM for 30 min. The cells were labeled with 400 \u03bcCi of 35 S-Promix (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) in 1 ml of Cys-and Met-deficient DMEM for 1 h. To allow for newly synthesized F proteins to reach the cell surface, the samples were chased with DMEM without serum for 2 h. The cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 1 ml of 0.5% hematocrit RBCs with or without 80 \u03bcg of N-1-HAt peptide for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. N-1-HAt peptide was expressed in bacteria and purified as previously described 54 . After washing at least five times with PBS to remove any unbound RBCs, the samples were incubated with 1 ml DMEM without serum containing 60 \u03bcg of anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 for 3 h at 4\u00b0C. After washing another five times with PBS, the cells were lysed with cold RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors and 50 mM iodoacetamide 81 \n\nMonolayers of HeLa CD4 LTR \u03b2gal cells in 6-well plates were transfected with 1.0 \u03bcg each of pCAGGS PIV5 F and HN DNA as described above. At 18 h p.t., cells were starved with Cys-and Met-deficient DMEM for 30 min. The cells were then labeled with 50 \u03bcCi of 35 S-Promix (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) in 1 ml of Cys-and Met-deficient DMEM for 1 h. Cells were Dounce homogenized in cold RSB buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mM KCl, and 15 mM MgCl 2 ), and 3 mM Cu(II)(1,10-phenanthroline) 3 (final concentration, freshly made) was added for 10 min at 37\u00b0C or 4\u00b0C. The reaction was stopped with 10 mM EDTA and 10 mM Nethylmaleimide (NEM) to chelate the copper and block free sulfhydryl groups. Samples were solubilized by adding 2X RIPA buffer plus 100 mM iodoacetamine and protease inhibitors as previously described 81 , and were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 55,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA100 rotor. Samples were incubated for 2 h at 4\u00b0C with 10 \u03bcl of rabbit polyclonal anti-F2 peptide antiserum, and then incubated with 40 \u03bcl protein A-Sepharose beads overnight at 4\u00b0C. Samples were washed with RIPA buffer as above and polypeptides analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 3.5% borate-acetate gels 82 under non-reducing conditions in the absence of DTT.\n\nTo better understand the periodic interface between the F protein TM domains, the raw radioactivity values were normalized by dividing the amount of disulfide formed by the total amount of protein (disulfide linked plus not linked). Because cross-linking is stronger towards the outside of the membrane and saturation can occur on the image plates of the Fuji Image Analyzer (Valhalla, NY), two sets of cross-linking data were combined for the analysis. First, cross-linking data using CuP at 37\u00b0C was used for most of the transmembrane positions, residues 492-509. To put the residues that are in the outer leaflet on the same scale, low temperature (4\u00b0C) CuP data was used for residue positions 485-491. Given the normalized data, a sine wave was fit according to the following formula: where x is the residue number, y is the normalized degree of cross-linking, a is the amplitude of the sine wave, b is the phase offset, c is the \u03b1-helical periodicity, and d is the y offset of the sine wave. Values were fit by non-linear regression. To visualize the cross-linking data on a single helix, cartoon representations of an ideal helix and a helix with a pi bulge were created with the interface residues labeled in spheres using the program PyMOL (DeLano, W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (2002), http://www.pymol.org). The modeling protocol for the TM trimer is described in the Supplemental Methods.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material. (A) The prefusion form of F contains a globular head with the HRA region in 11 distinct sections and the HRB region is in a three-helix bundle. The F TM domain is also represented as a three-helix bundle, consistent with the oxidative cross-linking data (Fig. 3) \n\nEach residue of the F protein TM domain was substituted with cysteine in a background in which the naturally occurring cysteine residue 492 was mutated to serine. The luciferase reporter gene assay was used to measure cell-cell fusion mediated by the single cysteine mutants in the Cys-background (pseudo wt). Vero cells were cotransfected to express HN, pseudo wt F or mutant F protein, and a luciferase reporter construct. Shown is the average of three experiments each done in triplicate and normalized to pseudo wt Cys-F. normalized by dividing the amount of disulfide formed by the total amount of protein. Also shown is the sine wave fit of the data. The data obtained with oxidation occurring at 4\u00b0C was used for residue positions 485-491, and the data obtained with oxidation occurring at 37\u00b0C data was used for the remaining positions (492-509). This was done to compensate for the greater disulfide bond formation that takes place in the outer leaflet and to maintain the signal on the image plate used to detect radioactivity within the linear range. (D) Ideal helix (left) and pi bulge (right) models of the TM helices. Interface positions predicted from disulfide crosslinking are shown in green spheres. For the first model, the TM domain is predicted to form a helix with a pi bulge at residues 497-500 (arrow). (E) Model of the TM helix trimer containg a pi-bulge (in green). On the left is a view from within the membrane, and on the right is a view from above. As in (D), interface positions are shown in green spheres. (F) Model of the TM trimer containing a stutter (in red). On the left is a view from within the membrane, and on the right is a view from above. Interface C \u03b2 positions for the model are shown in red spheres (C \u03b1 shown for G497). . HeLa CD4 LTR \u03b2gal cells expressing HN and wt F were metabolically labeled with 400 \u03bcCi of 35 S-Promix. Lane 1, wt F was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody specific for F (PAb vacF) to indicate the total amount of wt F. Cells were incubated with 0.5% of RBCs. HA-tagged N-1 peptide was added either before the RBC incubation, during the RBC incubation, or during the 37\u00b0C incubation used to initiate fusion. The F protein was then immunoprecipitated using the HA tag specific antibody 12CA5. Only a significant amount of F was immunoprecipitated when the N-1-HAt peptide was added with RBCs or during the 37\u00b0C incubation when the open-stalk intermediate has formed. (B) Immunoprecipitation of the open-stalk intermediate for F mutants L486A and I488A. HeLa CD4 LTR \u03b2gal cells expressing HN and wt F, F L486A, or F I488A were metabolically labeled with 400 \u03bcCi of 35 S-Promix. Lane 1: wt F plus N-1-HAt peptide with no antibody added. Lanes 2, 4, 6: HN and wt F, L486A, or I488A expressing cells were incubated with 0.5% of RBCs at 4\u00b0C in the absence of N-1-HAt peptide and were immunoprecipitated using PAb vac F (represents total F). Lanes 3, 5, 7: the N-1-HAt peptide was added during the RBC incubation at 4\u00b0C. The F protein was co-immunoprecipitated with MAb 12CA5. The polypeptides were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions on 15% acrylamide gels. (C) Quantification of RBC binding for HN only or HN plus wt F, F L486A, and F I488A expressing CV-1 cells. CV-1 cells labeled with SYTO 17 were incubated with RBCs labeled with 6-CF for 1h at 4\u00b0C. C-1 peptide was also added to some samples expressing wt F, F L486A, and F I488A during the 37\u00b0C incubation for 15 min to capture the pre-hairpin intermediate. Representative micrographs of syncytia formed in BHK-21F cells 20 h p.t. Cells were cotransfected with pCAGGS HN DNA and pCAGGS DNA encoding wt F, F L486A, or F I488A, the hyperfusogenic mutants F S443P, F G105A, or F G109A, or the double mutants containing a hyperfusogenic mutation and also F L486A or F I488A. (A) Quantification of cell-cell fusion in the dye transfer assay. Effector CV-1 cells were infected with vaccinia virus vTF7-3 and transfected with HN and wt F or mutant F DNA. RBCs were dually labeled with R18 (open bars) and the 6-CF (black bars). Labeled RBCs were bound to CV-1 cells for 1 h at 4\u00b0C and then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 min before visualization by confocal microscopy. Prior to incubation at 37\u00b0C, 10 \u03bcM LPC or 10 \u03bcM OA was added for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. 10 \u03bcM LPC or 10 \u03bcM OA was also present when the temperature was raised to 37\u00b0C. The means and error bars are from three microscopic fields. (B) Quantification of dye transfer with dually labeled RBCs as above, but with 0.5 mM CPZ was added for 1 min at room temperature and then washed out prior raising the temperature to 37\u00b0C to trigger fusion.\n\n(A) Cell-cell fusion of substitutions made at residues 486 and 488 were quantified using the luciferase reporter gene assay. Vero cells were cotransfected to express HN, and wt F or mutant F proteins, and a luciferase reporter construct. At 16 h p.t. BSR T7/5 cells were overlaid on the Vero cells, and 6 h post overlay, the luciferase activity of each sample was read. Dashed line indicates 50% of wt F fusion. Shown is the average of three experiments each done in triplicate and normalized to wt F. The next three panels show sequence suitability of protein sequences in the membrane quantified by the E(z) scale. (B) The mean (solid line) and one standard deviation above and below the average (dashed line) E(z) score for 153 transmembrane helices of known structure containing a minimum of 20 residues 65 . 20 residue sliding windows were used for each helix sequence, with the residues renumbered such that the lowest scoring (most membrane suitable) window occurs at residue number 0. The results for all 153 proteins were averaged after the renumbering. (C) E(z) results for four viral transmembrane proteins: PIV5 F, PIV5 HN, PIV5 SH, and influenza (flu) A M2. Horizontal lines show the mean (solid) and one standard deviation above and below (dashed) values for the 153 transmembrane helices in (A) . (D) E(z) results for four double mutants of PIV5 F. Residue positions L486 and I488 were mutated to alanine (A), threonine (T), tryptophan (W), and tyrosine (Y). Windows that do not include either mutation are shown in thick black (common region). (E) Atomistic model of the proposed extended transmembrane region of PIV5 F. The canonical TM is shown in green, while the N-terminal (blue) and C-terminal (red) regions that are more suitable for the membrane than one standard deviation above the mean are also shown. This region is expected to be more suitable for the membrane than any window in 24 of the 153 TM domain sequences. "}
