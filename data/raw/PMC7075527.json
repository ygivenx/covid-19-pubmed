{"title": "Functional Carbon Quantum Dots as Medical Countermeasures to Human\nCoronavirus", "body": "The eradication of viral infections is an ongoing challenge in the medical field, not only\ndue to the problem of spreading but also to the virus\u2019 ability to escape therapy by\ngenetic mutations. The lack of targeted antiviral therapeutics as well as the constant\nemergence of new viruses make the search for antiviral agents a challenging and extremely\nneeded research task.1 As part of a global strategy to prevent epidemics,\nsome severe emerging pathogens with great epidemic potential have been identified by the\nWorld Health Organization (WHO),2 including, next to Ebola virus disease,\nthe highly pathogenic human coronavirus (HCoV) infections. While circulating HCoVs\n(HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HKU1) cause relatively mild common cold-like\nrespiratory tract infections, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and\nMiddle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) lead to pneumonia requiring\nhospitalization and intensive care.3 A total of 2266 laboratory-confirmed\ncases of MERS-CoV, including 804 associated deaths, have been declared to the WHO until now,\nwith a high case-fatality rate (35%).4 As the virus is circulating in\nanimals and humans, it may undergo further adaptation and cause a pandemic. Therefore,\ntherapeutic options are urgently needed.\n\nThe current treatments for MERS-CoV are extrapolated from SARS-CoV and H1N1 influenza\noutbreaks.5\u22127 These include different\ncombinations of small molecules with broad antiviral activity (e.g., ribavirin,\ncorticosteroids, and interferons (IFN)), and monoclonal and polyclonal antibody\ntherapies.7,8 The\nmembrane-anchored glycoprotein S has lately been found to be essential for the interaction\nbetween the MERS-CoV and the host cell,8,9 and the development of MERS-CoV entry/fusion inhibitors targeting the S1\nsubunit is nowadays considered as a viable antiviral strategy.\n\nRecently, nanoscale materials have emerged as promising and efficient platforms to modulate\nthe viral infection cycle.10 Given that attachment of viruses into host\ncells is favored by multivalent interactions, the multivalent character of nanostructures\nwith their high surface to volume ratio, allowing the attachment of several ligands, makes\nthem well adapted to interfere with viral attachment and blocking viral entry into\ncells.\n\nIn this work, we investigate the potential of functional carbon quantum dots (CQDs) as\ninhibitors of host cells infection by HCoV-229E coronavirus (Figure 1). CQDs with an average diameter below 10 nm and excellent water\ndispersion are highly attractive for nanomedical applications due to a lack of visible signs\nof toxicity in animals.11 They can be synthesized quickly via several\ndifferent inexpensive and simple methods, and their excellent optical properties offer in\nvivo tracking possibilities. It was recently demonstrated that CQDs are suitable scaffolds\nto interfere with the entry of viruses into cells.12\u221214 Boronic acid-modified CQDs were able to inhibit, for example, HIV-1\nentry by suppressing syncytium formation.13 Some of us have shown lately\nthe potential of CQDs-functionalized with boronic acid and amine moieties to interfere with\nthe entry of herpes simplex virus type 1.12 Han and co-workers reported\nthe potential of CQDs as viral inhibitors by activation of type I interferon\nresponses.14\n\nThis unique study reveals that boronic acid functions can be responsible for the anti-HCoV\nactivity. CQDs derived from citric acid/ethylenediamine and further conjugated by\n\u201cclick\u201d chemistry with boronic acid functions display an effective 50%\ninhibition concentration EC50 = 52 \u00b1 8 \u03bcg mL\u20131.\nLikewise, CQDs derived from 4-aminophenylboronic acid and phenylboronic acid without any\nfurther modification exhibit antiviral behavior with a decreased effective EC50\ndown to 5.2 \u00b1 0.7 \u03bcg mL\u20131. The underlying mechanism of action\nof these CQDs was revealed to be the CQDs interaction with the HCoV-229E S protein.\nSurprisingly, an equally large inhibition activity was observed at the viral replication\nstep.\n\nBoronic acid derivatives have been proposed as low-toxicity agents for inhibiting the\nentry of various viruses.15,16 To test if such concepts can be extrapolated to human coronavirus\nHCoV-229E infections, boronic acid functional groups were chemically integrated onto\nCQDs-1 formed through hydrothermal carbonization of ethylenediamine/citric acid (Figure 2A). The approach consists of sealing the\norganic precursors in a Teflon-lined autoclave chamber and performing the formation of\nCQDs at elevated temperature under reduced pressure for 5 h. The pH value of the\nresulting CQDs suspensions was found to be 7.2 \u00b1 0.2 (n = 5). To\nremove larger precipitates, the as-obtained CQDs suspension was first centrifuged and\nthen dialyzed against water for 24 h with a final yield of CQDs of 40%. CQDs-1 exhibit\na spherical shape with an average diameter of 4.5 \u00b1 0.2 nm (Figure 2B). XPS analysis (Table 1) indicates the presence of C, O, and N. The C1s\nhigh-resolution XPS spectrum of CQDs-1 depicts three different carbon features: the\ngraphitic C=C at 283.4 eV, 284.9 eV (C\u2013H), and 286.4 eV (C\u2013O,\nC\u2013N) (Figure 2C). Analysis of the\nN1s high-resolution XPS shows the presence surface NH2 groups\n(399.9 eV) (Figure 2D). The Raman spectrum of\nthe CQD-1 (Figure 2E) displays the\ncharacteristic G band at 1570 cm\u20131 related to in-plane vibration of\nsp2 carbon, and the D band at 1350 cm\u20131 attributed to\ndisorder and defects. The ratio of the intensity of these bands\n(ID/IG), used to express the\nextent of sp2/sp3 hybridization of carbon atoms,17 is found to be 0.93 \u00b1 0.15 for all particles.18 XRD patterns indicate their crystalline nature (see Figure S1A) with a broad diffraction peak centered at 25.5\u00b0\ncorresponding to an interlayer spacing of 0.35 nm. This is larger than the spacing\nbetween (100) planes in bulk graphite (0.23 nm) due to the incorporation of functional\ngroups along the edges of the CQDs.19 The UV\u2212vis of CQDs-1\n(see Figure S1B) reveals an absorption maximum at \u223c242 nm attributed\nto \u03c0\u2013\u03c0* transition of C=C and a band at 344 nm due to\nn\u2212\u03c0* transition of C=O and C=N bonds.20,21 The fluorescence quantum yield\n(QY) is 0.33 as compared to that of quinine sulfate used as reference (QY, 0.54 in\n0.12 M H2SO4) (see Figure S1C). A wavelength-dependent fluorescence emission is observed\n(see Figure S1D) where upon increasing the excitation wavelength, the\nemission gradually shifts to the red region with an increase in fluorescence\nintensity. The phenomenon of excitation-dependent emission is typical for such\nnanostructures.5\u22127 The zeta potential\nand hydrodynamic size of the CQDs-1 are summarized in Table 1.\n\nThe formation of CQDs-3 is based on a two-step chemical process. In a first step,\nazido-functionalized CQDs-2 are prepared by coupling 2-azido acetic acid moieties to\nCQDs-1. The N1s signal of CQDs-2 shows signals at 405.2\n(\u2212N=N+=N\u2013)\nand 401.6 eV\n(N=N+=N\u2013)\nin a 1:2 ratio, as theoretically expected (Figure 2F). The azide functions in CQDs-2 quantitatively react with alkyne\nfunctions as indicated by the absence of the azide band at 405.2 eV in the relevant\nspectra of CQDs-3 and CQDs-4 (Figure 2F). The\nband at 399.2 eV (\u2212NH2) is most likely resulting from partial\nhydrolysis of surface linked 2-azido acetic ester function. CQDs-4 were synthesized as\na control to check whether the triazole function acts as a passive linker or\nnot.2223 The morphologies of CQDs-3 and CQDs-4\nare comparable to that of CQDs-1 with an average diameter of 6.25 \u00b1 0.17 nm\n(Figure 2B) and diffraction peak centered\nat 25.3\u00b0 for CQDs-3 (see Figure S1A) and an average diameter of 6.50 \u00b1 0.40 nm (Figure 2B), and diffraction peak centered at\n25.4\u00b0 for CQDs-4. The Raman spectra of the CQDs-2\u20134 (Figure 2G) are similar to that of CQDs-1 displaying the\ncharacteristic G and D bands with\nID/IG = 0.93 \u00b1 0.15 for\nall particles.18 The colloidal stability of CQDs-1\u20134 in\nwater, phosphate buffer (PBS, 10 mM), and Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s\nmedium (M) was, in addition, examined. All of the particles had good long-term\ncolloidal stability as seen from the photographs in Figure 2H.\n\nThe cell toxicity of CQDs-1, CQDs-3, and CQDs-4 was established on Huh-7 cell lines\nafter 8 h (time points corresponding to HCoV-229E infections) and 24 h incubation. The\nCQDs toxicity was evaluated using cell viability assessment by the resazurin assay,\nbased on the conversion of nonfluorescent dye to a fluorescent molecule by mitochondrial\nand cytoplasmatic enzymes. All CQDs are nontoxic to Huh-7 cells even at the highest\nconcentration (100 \u03bcg mL\u20131) investigated when incubated for 8\nand 24 h (Figure 3A). Neither the presence of\nboronic acid nor triazole units had a negative effect on cell toxicity.\n\nThe uptake mechanism proved to be the same for all of the nanostructures. Taking the\nexample of CQDs-3 (which later proves to have antiviral activity), Huh-7 cells were\nfixed after 1 h incubation at 4 and 37 \u00b0C, and then nuclei were stained with\nHoechst 33342, a fluorescent dye for labeling DNA in fluorescence microcopy (Figure 3B). The green fluorescence, which is\nattributed to the CQDs-3, is homogeneously distributed in the cytoplasm after 1 h when\nincubated at 37 \u00b0C, which confirms the internalization of CQDs-3 inside the cells.\nThe reduction of green fluorescence, observed in the cytoplasm after 1 h incubation at 4\n\u00b0C, suggests that the active internalization mechanism may be partially blocked,\nand a small portion of CQDs was internalized by passive penetration.\n\nThe endocytosis of CQDs-3 was, in addition, quantitatively evaluated using flow\ncytometry by treating Huh-7 cells with 100 \u03bcg mL\u20131 of CQDs-3 for\n1 h at 4 \u00b0C and for 1, 3, and 6 h at 37 \u00b0C (Figure S2). The excitation fluorescence of CQDs-3 at 488 nm allowed\nanalysis of CQDs intracellularly. A progressive shift in the cell population toward\nhigher fluorescence values was observed with a subsequent increase of time incubation\ndue to the time-dependent cellular uptake likely through endocytosis. Lower fluorescence\nintensity was observed upon incubation at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h, where the\nactive uptake process is blocked. The low percentage of green cells (0.8%) observed\nafter 1 h at 4 \u00b0C suggests that only a very low quantity of CQDs-3\npenetrates via passive uptake.\n\nThe antiviral activity of CQDs-1, CQDs-3, and CQDs-4 was evaluated on Huh-7 cell\nmonolayers, infected with HCoV-229E-Luc (Figure 4A). Addition of CQDs-1 after 1 h infection and further incubation for 6 h at\n37 \u00b0C shows no inhibition of infection. This contrasts to CQDs-3 where a\nconcentration-dependent virus inactivation is observed with an estimated EC50\n= 52 \u00b1 8 \u03bcg mL\u20131 (Figure 4B). Addition of mannose to CQDs-3 results in a complete loss of antiviral\nactivity of the latter at low particle concentrations, with some antiviral activity\nabove 50 \u03bcg mL\u20131 CQDs. These data reveal two important findings.\nFirst, it highlights that boronic acid functions, where the mode of action is the\nselective and reversible formation of tetravalent complexes with\ncis-diols and thus glycan units,24 are interacting\nwith HCoV-229E. CQDs-3 are in this context speculated to be pseudolectins, targeting the\nS protein of HCoV-229E via a lectin\u2013carbohydrate binding mechanism, similar to\nthat of the oligomannose-specific lectin Griffithsin.25 Thus, the\npresence of mannose is blocking the antiviral activity in favor of this mechanistic\nbehavior. The presence of some antiviral activity of the mannose saturated CQDs-3 might\nbe due to the presence of the triazole function on the particles\u2019 surface.\nIndeed, the control particles CQDs-4, bearing no boronic acid function but a triazole\nring, display some antiviral activity, even though largely decreased when compared to\nCQDs-3.\n\nWith the aim to validate if boronic acid functions can be formed directly on CQDs,\nhydrothermal carbonization of phenylboronic acid and 4-aminophenylboronic acid was\nperformed resulting in CQDs-5 and CQDs-6, respectively (Figure 5A). As control, hydrothermal carbonization of aniline and\npolyethylene glycol (PEG600), both lacking boronic acid functions, was\nconducted. Unfortunately, several attempts to prepare CQDs from aniline as a starting\nmaterial failed (see the Supporting Information for experimental details).\n\nThe TEM images of CQDs-5\u20137 are seen in Figure 5B. CQDs-5 have an average diameter of 9.2 \u00b1 0.3 nm, somehow larger than\nCQDs-6 with an average size of 7.6 \u00b1 0.2 nm (Table 2). The particles formed from PEG (CQDs-7) display a spherical\nshape with an average diameter of 8.0 \u00b1 0.2 nm.\n\nThe XRD diffractograms (see Figure S3A) display broad diffraction peaks centered at 21.3\u00b0 for\nCQDs-5, 22.6\u00b0 for CQDs-6, and 22.1\u00b0 for CQDs-7, corresponding to an interlayer\nspacing of 0.42 nm (CQDs-5), 0.40 nm (CQDs-6), and 0.39 nm (CQDs-7). The UV\u2212vis\nabsorption spectra of the CQDs are depicted in Figure S3B. The absorption shoulders at 250\u2013300 nm correspond to a\ntypical absorption of an aromatic \u03c0 system, in accordance with the literature\ndata.26 The CQDs exhibit different fluorescence quantum yields (QY)\nof 0.03 (CQDs-5), 0.05 (CQDs-6), and 0.09 (CQDs-7) (Figure S3C). The wavelength-dependent fluorescence emission properties of\nthe CQDs are comparable (Figure S3D). The zeta potential and hydrodynamic size of CQDs-5\u20137\nare summarized in Table 2. Raman spectra of the\nCQDs-5\u20137 (Figure S3E) are comparable to that of CQDs-1 displaying the characteristic\nG and D band with ID/IG = 0.93\n\u00b1 0.15 for all particles.\n\nThe chemical composition of the particles was thus further assessed using X-ray\nphotoelectron spectroscopy and 11B NMR. The XPS survey spectra of different\nCQDs (Table 2) indicate the presence of\nC1s, O1s, N1s, and B1s in agreement with\nthe chemical composition of the particles. Deconvolution of the C1s XPS\nspectrum of CQDs-5 reveals bands located at 284.3 eV (C=C, sp2), 285.1\neV (C\u2013H, C\u2013B), and a small contribution centered at 287.0 eV (C=O)\n(Figure 5C). The boron content is lower than\nthat reported by Shen and Xi,27 but comparable to that reported by\nWang et al.28 This indicates that some of the phenylboronic acid\ngroups were carbonized under our experimental conditions. The low B content might also\nindicate doping rather than the presence of boronic acid function. CQDs-6 particles\ndepict bands at 284.3 eV (C=C, sp2), 285.2 eV (C\u2013H,\nC\u2013B), 287.3 eV (C=O), and a band at 290.3 eV due to O\u2013C=O\nfunctions. In the case of CQDs-7, the C1s XPS spectrum comprises three\ndifferent carbon features: the graphitic C=C at 283.4 eV, 284.9 eV (C\u2013H),\nand 286.4 eV (C\u2013O, C\u2013N). Analysis of the N1s high-resolution\nspectrum of CQDs-5 reveals the presence of surface \u2212NH2 groups (Figure 5D).\n\nThe FTIR spectra (Figure 5E) of\nCQDs-5\u20137 exhibit a distinct band at 3465 cm\u20131 attributed to the\nstretching vibration of \u2212OH groups and bands at around 2874 and 2924\ncm\u20131 due to CH2 stretching bands. The sharp band at 1618\ncm\u20131 is assigned to graphitic C=C, and the C\u2013H\ndeformation mode is seen at 1460 cm\u20131. The C=O band at\n\u223c1780\u20131650 cm\u20131 is also visible in all cases. In the\ncase of CQDs-6, the band at 1090 cm\u20131 might be due to C\u2013B\nstretching modes. This band is less defined in the case of CQDs-5, which might underline\ndoping rather than the presence of boronic acid functions. The FTIR spectrum of CQDs-7\ndisplays the C\u2013O\u2013C bands of the PEG units at 1043\ncm\u20131.\n\nCQDs-5\u20137 exhibited a negative zeta potential in water (pH 7.4) at room\ntemperature and showed excellent long-term stability even in biological medium such as\nDulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s medium (M) (Figure 5F).\n\nThe cytotoxicity of CQDs-5\u20137 (Figure 6)\nis comparable to that of CQDs discussed before (Figure 3), with CQDs-6 being slightly more toxic at concentrations >25 \u03bcg\nmL\u20131 after 24 h incubation. This might be due to the presence of\nNH2 groups on these particles. The uptake mechanism of these particles was\ncomparable and is exemplified using CQDs-6 in Figure S4. Because of low intrinsic fluorescence of CQDs-6 particles, they\nwere labeled with fluorescein-NHS.\n\nAddition of CQDs-7 after 1 h infection and further incubation for 6 h at 37 \u00b0C\nshowed no inhibition of infection (Figure 7A),\nindicating that these particles are not interfering with HCoV-229E-Luc entry or\nreplication. CQDs-5 and CQDs-6 display a concentration-dependent virus inactivation. The\ndose\u2013response curve (Figures 7B) reveals\nthat the effective concentration to achieve 50% inhibition (EC50) against\nHCoV-229E-Luc infection is 5.2 \u00b1 0.7 \u03bcg mL\u20131 for CQDs-6 and\n11.6 \u00b1 1.1 \u03bcg mL\u20131 for CQDs-5. Surprisingly, addition of\nmannose did not result in a loss of the antiviral activity (Figure\n7C), as observed previously for CQDs-3.\n\nPerforming 11B NMR analysis of CQDs-5 and CQDs-6 (Figure\n7D) and comparing the obtained spectra to those of the\nrespective starting materials, 4-aminophenylboronic acid and phenyl boronic acid (Figure 7E), reveal large differences in chemical\ncomposition. 4-Aminophenylboronic acid and phenyl boronic both exhibit a strong signal\nat around 29 ppm, in accordance with literature data for \u2212B(OH)2\nfunctions.29,30\nThe small signal at about 20 ppm arises most likely from residual B(OR)3\noften used in boronic acid synthesis.31 The 11B NMR\nspectra of CQDs-5 and CQDs-6 display, however, peaks at 13 ppm (CQDs-5) and a band at 10\nppm with a shoulder at 12 ppm for CQDs-6. This means that boron was incorporated through\ndoping rather than surface functionalization, during the hydrothermal reaction. Indeed,\none-pot solvothermal synthesis using aminophenylboronic acid precursor was reported by\nWang et al. to result in N and B codoped CQDs.32 They indeed reported\nthe presence of 0.7 at. % B by XPS comparable to the amount obtained here (Table 2).\n\nWe further investigated the mechanism of action of CQDs-3 and CQDs-6 on viral infection\nby performing a time-of-addition assay. CQDs (at 10 \u03bcg mL\u20131) were\nadded at different time points during infection, as represented in Figure\n8A. As expected, a strong inhibition of infection was observed\nwhen CQDs were added after 1 h inoculation. Moreover, the inhibition activity of CQDs was\nstronger when the nanoparticles were added during the entry step, that is, 30 minutes\nbefore and after inoculation and during inoculation. These results agree with our\nhypothesis of an interaction of CQDs with HCoV-229E S protein, or an interaction of CQDs\nwith entry factors. Surprisingly, a strong inhibitory activity of CQDs was also observed\nwhen they were added after 5.5 h after the entry step, the replication step. The\ninhibition is not significantly different for the entry step as compared to the\nreplication step. This suggests that, in addition to its major effect on HCoV-229E entry,\nCQDs can also affect the genomic replication of this virus. This could potentially be\nexplained by an interaction between the CQDs and a cell surface protein leading to signal\ntransduction affecting viral replication, or by an interaction with cytosolic proteins as\nCQDs are internalized.\n\nTo determine if CQDs are interacting directly with viral particles, HCoV-229E-Luc was\nincubated with CQDs at 10 \u03bcg mL\u20131 for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C before\ninoculation. The inoculum was diluted 10 times, leading to a final concentration of CQDs\nof 1 \u03bcg mL\u20131, and infection assay was performed. In parallel,\nHuh-7 cells were inoculated with HCoV-229E-Luc in the presence of CQDs at 1 or 10 \u03bcg\nmL\u20131. The inoculum titers were kept constant in the different\nconditions. The results showed that the preincubation of the virus with CQDs at high\nconcentration does not impair HCoV-229E infection, meaning that CQDs are not interacting\nwith the particles before infection (Figure 8B).\nTaken together, our results are in favor of an interaction of CQDs with cellular factors\nthat may explain their antiviral effects at different steps of infection.\n\nThe viral infection cycle produces important biological and structural changes in the host\ncell, resulting in cell damage. The possibility to interfere with viral attachment to cells\nas well as viral replication to reduce viral infection and spreading is an appropriate\nantiviral approach. We presented here the antiviral performance of seven different CQDs with\ntheir main features summarized in Table 3. Three of\nthese CQDs (CQDs-3, -5, -6) were shown to interfere significantly with HCoV-229E-Luc\ninfection in a concentration-dependent manner, while CQDs-4 showed a very moderate antiviral\nactivity. The estimated EC50 value decreased considerably from CQDs-3, boronic\nacid-modified quantum dots, derived from ethylenediamine/citric acid as carbon precursors\n(EC50 = 52 \u00b1 8 \u03bcg mL\u20131) to 5.2 \u00b1 0.7 \u03bcg\nmL\u20131 in the case of CQDs-6. While the presence of boronic acid functions\nproved to be vital for covering CQDs-3 with antiviral activity, CQDs-5 and CQDS-6 did not\ncarry a substantial amount of boronic acid functions, as revealed by 11B NMR and\nvalidated by mannose addition experiments. These findings reveal the complex nature of\nidentifying viral inhibitors for human coronaviruses such as HCoV-229E-Luc. Mechanistic\nstudies suggest that the particles are acting at the early state of virus infection through\nthe inhibition of entry that could be due to inhibition of protein S-receptor interaction\nwith the host cell membrane. All different particles interfere in addition with the viral\nreplication step, something less common. These results are extremely encouraging to replace\ncurrently used antiviral agents such a ribavirin and IFN known to have major side effects\nsuch as confusion, short-term memory loss, deficits in executive functions, as well as\nextrapyramidal effects. Further experimental confirmations are required if this approach can\nbe extrapolated to other coronaviruses, notably to the clinically relevant MERS-CoV, to\nvalidate the potential of these nanostructures as alternative anti-MERS therapeutics and\napproaches to confront this severe and life-threatening disease. Also, how such particles\nwork in vivo has to be shown in the future.\n\nCitric acid, ethylenediamine, 4-aminophenylboronic acid, phenylboronic acid,\npoly(ethylene glycol) (PEG600, molecular weight 570\u2013630),\nN-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)-N\u2032-ethylcarbodimide\nhydrochloride (EDC), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), propargyl alcohol,\n4-pentynoic acid, copper sulfate pentahydrate, l-ascorbic acid, and sodium\nhydroxide were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The dialysis membranes were supplied by\nSpectrum Laboratories.\n\nParticles were synthesized following a method similar to that reported by Zhu et\nal.33 (see Supporting Information SI1 for more details). The details about the\ncharacterization instruments can be found in Supporting Information SI2.\n\nAzide-terminated CQDs-2 were obtained from CQDs-1 by the use of carbodiimide chemistry.\nTo a solution of 2-azidoacetic acid (1 mg mL\u20131, 0.1X PBS) was added an\nequimolar amount of EDC\u00b7HCl and NHS, and the solution was stirred for 20 min to\nactivate the carboxyl group. To this solution was added CQDs-1 (1 mg\nmL\u20131, 0.1X PBS) in a 1:2 volume ratio (v/v). The reaction was\ncarried out for 5 h at room temperature, and the resulting solution was then dialyzed\nagainst Milli-Q water using cellulose ester dialysis membrane for 24 h (Biotech CE no.\n131093, molecular weight cutoff 500\u20131000 Da) to remove unreacted material.\n\nCQDs-2 were further reacted with \u201cclickable\u201d phenyl boronic acid\nderivative 4-[(1-oxo-4-pentyn-1-yl)amino]phenylboronic acid, synthesized as reported\npreviously.34 For this, CQDs-2 (1 mg mL\u20131, 5 mL)\nwere mixed with 4-[(1-oxo-4-pentyn-1-yl) amino] phenylboronic acid (2 mM), copper\nsulfate pentahydrate (200 \u03bcM), and ascorbic acid (300 \u03bcM). The reaction\nmixture was stirred for 24 h at room temperature. EDTA was added to the mixture prior to\ndialysis (SpectraPor 1, pore size: 1000 Da) against Milli-Q water for 48 h.\n\nCQDs-2 were further reacted with commercially available propargyl alcohol. For this,\nCQDs-2 (1 mg mL\u20131, 5 mL) were mixed with propargyl alcohol (2 mM),\ncopper sulfate pentahydrate (200 \u03bcM), and ascorbic acid (300 \u03bcM). The\nreaction mixture was stirred for 24 h at room temperature. EDTA was added to the mixture\nprior to dialysis (SpectraPor 1, pore size: 1000 Da) against Milli-Q water for 48 h.\n\nParticles were prepared according to the protocol recently described by us.12\n\nParticles were prepared in a manner similar to that for CQDs-2 by dissolving PEG600\n(200 mg) in water (20 mL) and adjusting the pH to 9.0 by adding NaOH (0.5 M). The\nsolution was degassed with nitrogen gas during 1 h to remove dissolved oxygen and heated\nin a Teflon-lined autoclave chamber (125 mL \u2013 acid digestion vessel no. 4748,\nParr, France) for 72 h at 120 \u00b0C. After being cooled to room temperature, the\nsolution was dialyzed against water for 24 h with water being changed every 6 h\n(SpectraPor 1, pore size: 3500 Da).\n\nThe Huh-7 hepatocarcinoma cell line was cultured and maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s\nModified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum\n(FBS, Gibco) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco) in a humidified incubator at 37\n\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Cells were seeded at a density of 15 \u00d7\n103 cells/well in a 96-well plate and grown for 24 h before assay. The\nculture medium was replaced with a fresh medium that contains increasing concentrations\nof CQDs for 2 and 8 h from 1 to 100 \u03bcg mL\u20131. The old medium was\nthen aspirated, and cells were washed with PBS. The cell viability was evaluated using\nresazurin cell viability assay. Briefly, 100 mL of the resazurin solution (11 \u03bcg\nmL\u20131) in DMEM/10% FBS was added to each well, and the plate was\nincubated for 4 h in the humidified incubator. The fluorescence emission of each well\nwas measured at 593 nm (20 nm bandwidth) with an excitation at 554 nm (18 nm bandwidth)\nusing a Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek Instruments SAS, France). Each\ncondition was replicated three times, and the mean fluorescence value of nonexposed\ncells was taken as 100% cellular viability.\n\nTo study the uptake mechanism of the particles into cells, CQDs were dissolved in PBS\nbuffer (pH 7.4) at the concentration of 2 mg mL\u20131. Fluorescein-NHS was\ndissolved in DMF (10 mg mL\u20131). A solution of CQDs-5 was cooled to 0\n\u00b0C, and 10 \u03bcL of freshly prepared fluorescein-NHS solution was added. The\nreaction was stirred on ice for another 3 h. To remove the excess of the fluorescein\ndye, a Sephadex G-25 PD-10 desalting column was used. Cells were seeded at a density of\n15 \u00d7 104 cells/well in a 24-well plate with sterile coverslips at the\nbottom and grown for 24 h before assay. The culture medium was replaced with a fresh\nmedium that contained 100 \u03bcg mL\u20131 of CQDs. After 1 h incubation\nat 4 and 37 \u00b0C, the Huh-7 cells were washed with PBS (three times), fixed with 4%\nparaformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and then stained with 10 \u03bcg\nmL\u20131 Hoechst 33342 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature in the\ndark. After being washed with PBS, the coverslips were mounted on glass slides and\nrecorded using a Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek Instruments SAS,\nFrance) equipped with 40\u00d7 objective (Plan Fluorite WD 2.7 NA 0.6). The fluorescence\nimages were acquired with the same exposure using DAPI (377/447 nm) and GFP (469/525 nm)\nexcitation/emission filter sets. All of the images were processed using Gen5 Image+\nsoftware.\n\nFor cellular uptake, cells were seeded at a density of 15 \u00d7 104\ncells/well in a six-well plate and grown for 48 h before assay. The culture medium was\nreplaced with a fresh medium that contained 100 \u03bcg mL\u20131 of CQDs.\nAfter 1 h incubation at 4 \u00b0C and 1, 3, and 6 h incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the Huh-7\ncells were washed with PBS (three times) and collected by trypsinization. The cells\nsuspensions were resuspended in PBS/PFA 0.5% and analyzed through a flow cytometer (BD\nLSR Fortessa) with FITC channel. The data were collected (104 cells per\nsample) and analyzed using BD FACSDiva 8.0.1 software.\n\nWe used a modified HCoV-229E containing a renilla luciferase reporter gene\nHCoV-229E-Luc. The viral stocks were produced in Huh-7 cells. Huh-7 cells were infected\nwith a prestock of HCoV-229E-Luc in flasks. After 5 days, the supernatants of flasks\nwere collected. For infection assay, Huh-7 cells, 15 000/well seeded in 96-well\nplate, were inoculated with HCoV-229E-Luc at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1\nduring 1 h at 37 \u00b0C in DMEM without serum, and then the inoculum was removed and\ncells were incubated in complete culture medium for 6 h at 37 \u00b0C. CQDs were added\nto cells during the 1 h of infection. Cells were lysed in 20 \u03bcL of Renilla Lysis\nBuffer (Promega, Madison, WI) and luciferase activity quantified using a Renilla\nLuciferase Assay System kit (Promega, Madison, WI) as recommended by the manufacturer\nand a Tristar LB 941 luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). To\nmeasure EC50, dose\u2013response experiment was performed with CQDs added\nat different concentrations during inoculation step and postinoculation step. For\ntime-of-addition assays, CQDs were added at different time points at 10 \u03bcg\nmL\u20131. For all experiments, water was used as a control because CQDs\nare diluted in water.\n\nThe statistical test used is a Mann\u2013Whitney nonparametric with a confidence\ninterval of 95%. The data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism (version 5.0b) by\ncomparison between treated and untreated groups (DMSO control). P\nvalues of 0.05 were considered to be significantly different from the control."}
