{"title": "Ligand-induced Dimerization of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome\n(MERS) Coronavirus nsp5 Protease (3CLpro)", "body": "Coronaviruses (CoVs)3 are enveloped,\npositive-strand RNA viruses that infect a variety of vertebrates, including bats,\nlivestock, pets, poultry, and humans (1\u20133). Although human CoVs cause respiratory illnesses of mild to moderate\nseverity (4\u20139), two recently emerged\nCoVs, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East\nrespiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have demonstrated their potential to\nbecome a serious threat to public health. MERS-CoV emerged late in 2012, and unlike\nits predecessor SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV continues to exhibit up to a 35% fatality rate\n(10\u201312).\n\nBased on the sequence analysis of seven genes of the replicase domain, MERS-CoV has\nbeen classified as a \u03b2-CoV genogroup 2c member, along with closely related\nbat coronaviruses HKU5 (Pipistrellus bat) and HKU4\n(Tylonycteris bat) (13,\n14). Increasing evidence suggests that\nbats may serve as zoonotic reservoirs for MERS-CoV (15, 16). Evidence presented by\nrecent studies also supports the local zoonotic transmission of MERS-CoV from\ndromedary camels to humans (17, 18). Alarmingly, human-to-human transmission\nduring close contact, especially in elderly or patients with underlying health\nconditions, has also been reported for MERS-CoV (19\u201322). In the wake of the recent upsurge in the\nlaboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV, including two recently identified cases in\nthe United States (23), there is an urgent\nneed to study and characterize the properties of important drug targets of MERS-CoV\nfor the development of effective therapeutics.\n\nCoronaviruses express a >800-kDa replicase polyprotein, which is processed by\nviral 3CLpro protease (or nsp5) at 11 distinct cleavage sites to yield\nintermediate and mature nonstructural proteins (nsp) responsible for many aspects of\nvirus replication (3, 24\u201326). Because of its indispensable role in the\nvirus life cycle, 3CLpro is an important target for therapeutic\nintervention against coronavirus infections (27\u201333).\n\nA number of kinetic, biophysical, and x-ray structural studies have demonstrated that\nSARS-CoV 3CLpro is only active in vitro as a tightly\nassociated dimer with a dimer dissociation constant (Kd)\nin the low nanomolar range (34\u201338). The addition or deletion of amino acids, e.g.\nHis6 affinity tags, at either the N or C terminus drastically reduces\nthe enzymatic rate and decreases the ability of SARS-CoV 3CLpro to\ndimerize (37). Although cellular evidence for\nthe auto-cleavage mechanism (cis versus trans) of 3CLpro\nis lacking, models for how 3CLpro cleaves itself from the polyprotein to\nform the mature dimer have been proposed based on in vitro studies\nusing purified 3CLpro (34, 39, 40).\nA current model posits that two inactive 3CLpro molecules within two\nseparate polyproteins recognize each other and form an immature dimer capable of\ncleaving the nsp4\u2193nsp5 and nsp5\u2193nsp6 sites in\ntrans, followed by formation of an active and mature dimer that can\nthen rapidly process other cleavage sites and multiple polyproteins. It has also\nbeen proposed that substrate-induced dimerization regulates the enzymatic activity\nof SARS-CoV 3CLpro during virus replication; however, no experimental\nevidence of this has ever been demonstrated in infected cells (40). Although our knowledge of SARS-CoV 3CLpro\nis extensive, the dimerization properties of 3CLpro from MERS-CoV and\nother coronaviruses, as well as the factors regulating their enzymatic activity,\nremain largely unknown.\n\nTo understand the properties of MERS-CoV 3CLpro, we conducted a series of\nkinetic, biophysical and x-ray structural studies. Here, we report a detailed\nkinetic and biophysical analysis of MERS-CoV 3CLpro activity and\ndimerization. These kinetic and biophysical studies provide evidence for a weakly\nassociated MERS-CoV 3CLpro dimer. In addition, we utilized our previous\nknowledge on the design of potent SARS-CoV 3CLpro peptidic inhibitors to\ndesign a series of inhibitors of MERS-CoV 3CLpro that exhibit low\nmicromolar potency. We demonstrate that MERS-CoV 3CLpro requires the\nbinding of a ligand for dimer formation, indicating that ligand-induced dimerization\nis likely a key mechanism in the regulation of MERS-CoV 3CLpro activity\nduring virus infection.\n\nThe gene encoding 3CLpro protease of MERS-CoV (amino acid\nresidues 3248\u20133553 in the replicase polyprotein,\nGenBankTM accession number AHC74086.1) was codon-optimized\nfor optimal expression in E. coli (BioBasic Inc). The\ngene was subcloned into pET-11a expression vector with an N-terminal\nHis6 tag followed by the nsp4\u2193nsp5 auto-cleavage\nsite using the forward primer\n5\u2032-ATATACATATGCACCACCACCACCACCACAGCGGTGTTCTGCAGTCTGGTC-3\u2032\nand the reverse primer\n5\u2032-GACGGATCCTTACTGCATCACAACACCCATGATCTGC-3\u2032. The\nconstruct was verified by DNA sequencing at the Purdue University\nGenomics Core Facility. This construct results in the expression of\nMERS-CoV 3CLpro without any N- or C-terminal extensions.\nMERS-CoV 3CLpro was expressed through auto-induction in\nEscherichia coli BL21-DE3 cells in the presence of\n100 \u03bcg/ml carbenicillin as described previously (41). Cells were harvested by centrifugation\nat 5000 \u00d7 g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C, and the\npellets were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until further use.\n\nFrozen pellets from 4 liters of bacterial cell culture were thawed on ice\nand resuspended in 250 ml of Buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.05\nmm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm\n\u03b2-mercaptoethanol (BME)), containing 500 \u03bcg of lysozyme\nand a small amount of DNase. Cells were then lysed using a single pass\nthrough a French press at 1200 p.s.i., and cell debris was removed from\nthe cleared lysate by centrifuging at 29,000 \u00d7\ng for 30 min. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to\nthe cleared lysate to a final concentration of 1 m through\ngradual mixing on ice.\n\nThe cleared lysate, mixed with ammonium sulfate, was loaded at a flow\nrate of 3 ml/min onto a 60-ml phenyl-Sepharose 6 fast-flow high-sub\ncolumn (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer B (50 mm\nTris, pH 7.5, 1 m ammonium sulfate, 0.05 mm EDTA, 10%\nglycerol, and 5 mm BME). The column was then washed with\n5\u00d7 column volume (300 ml) of Buffer B at a flow rate of 4\nml/min. Protein was eluted using a 5\u00d7 column volume (300 ml)\nlinear gradient to 100% Buffer A. Fractions (12 ml) were collected, and\nthose containing MERS-CoV 3CLpro, as judged through SDS-PAGE\nanalysis and specific activity measurements, were pooled (120 ml) and\nexchanged into 2 liters of Buffer A via overnight dialysis in a 10,000\nmolecular weight cutoff SnakeSkin\u00ae dialysis tubing (Thermo\nScientific).\n\nDialyzed sample from the previous step was loaded at a flow rate of 3\nml/min onto a 120- ml DEAE anion-exchange column (Amersham Biosciences)\nequilibrated with Buffer A. The column was then washed with 2\u00d7\ncolumn volume (240 ml) of Buffer A at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. A linear\ngradient (total volume 480 ml) to 40% Buffer C (50 mm Tris, pH\n7.5, 1 m NaCl, 0.05 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 5\nmm BME) was used to elute the protein. Fractions (6 ml)\nwere collected, and those containing MERS-CoV 3CLpro were\npooled (66 ml) and dialyzed for 4 h in 4 liters of Buffer D (20\nmm MES, pH 5.5, 0.05 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 5\nmm BME).\n\nFollowing dialysis, the pH of the sample was manually adjusted to 5.5\nusing 1 m solution of MES, pH 5.5, and any precipitated protein\nwas removed by filtering through a 0.22-\u03bcm pore size Millex-GP\nfilter (Millipore). The filtered sample was then loaded at a flow rate\nof 2 ml/min onto an 8-ml Mono S 10/100 column (Amersham Biosciences)\nequilibrated in Buffer D. The column was then washed with 5\u00d7\ncolumn volume (40 ml) of Buffer D at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Protein\nwas eluted using a 25\u00d7 column volume (200 ml) and a linear\ngradient to 50% Buffer E (50 mm MES, pH 5.5, 1 m NaCl,\n0.05 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm BME). Fractions\n(2 ml) were collected, and those containing MERS-CoV 3CLpro\nwere pooled (22 ml) and concentrated to \u223c5 mg/ml.\n\nAs the final purification step, the concentrated protein sample was\nloaded onto the preparation grade Superdex 75 26/60 gel filtration\ncolumn (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer F (25 mm\nHEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)).\nProtein was eluted isocratically at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with Buffer\nF. Fractions (2 ml) containing MERS-CoV 3CLpro were pooled\n(total volume of 34 ml) and concentrated to \u223c5 mg/ml. For final\nstorage of the purified MERS-CoV 3CLpro enzyme,\n300-\u03bcl protein aliquots were placed into 1-ml screw-cap vials,\nflash-frozen under liquid nitrogen, and then stored at \u221280\n\u00b0C until further use.\n\nSARS-CoV 3CLpro and HKU5-CoV 3CLpro with authentic\nN and C termini were expressed and purified as described previously\n(37, 42). HKU4-CoV 3CLpro was purified\nutilizing a modified protocol from Ref. 42. Final protein yield was calculated based on the\nmeasurement of total activity units (\u03bcm product/min),\nspecific activity (units/mg), and milligrams of protein obtained\n(Bio-Rad protein assay) after each chromatographic step.\n\nThe peptidomimetic compounds with Michael acceptor groups (compounds\n1-9, Table\n3) were synthesized via very similar methods to those\npublished previously (30, 43). Synthesis of noncovalent\npeptidomimetic compounds 10 and 11 (Table 3) has been described\npreviously (33).\n\nThe enzymatic activity of 3CLpro was measured using the\nfollowing custom-synthesized peptide:\nHilyteFluorTM-488-ESATLQSGLRKAK-(QXLTM-520)-NH2\n(AnaSpec, Inc.). The HilyteFluorTM-488 fluorescence group was\ninternally quenched by QXLTM-520 dye. This substrate works as\na generic peptide substrate for 3CLpro enzymes and was\ndesigned based on the nsp4\u2193nsp5 cleavage sequence for many\ncoronavirus 3CLpro enzymes. The rate of enzymatic activity\nwas determined at 25 \u00b0C by following the increase in\nfluorescence (\u03bbexcitation = 485 nm,\n\u03bbemission = 528 nm, bandwidths = 20 nm) of Hilyte\nFluorTM-488 upon peptide hydrolysis by the enzyme as a\nfunction of time. Assays were conducted in black, half-area, 96-well\nplates (Corning Glass) in assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5,\n0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 2 mm DTT) using a final\nreaction volume of 100 \u03bcl. The resulting florescence was\nmonitored using a BioTek Synergy H1 plate reader. The rate of the\nreaction in arbitrary fluorescence units/s (AFU/s) was determined by\nmeasuring the initial slope of the progress curves, which were then\nconverted to units of micromolars of product produced per min\n(\u03bcm/min) using experimentally determined values of\nfluorescence \u201cextinction coefficient\u201d as described\npreviously (37). All reactions\nwere carried out in triplicate.\n\nThe apparent enzymatic efficiency for each of the 3CLpro\nenzymes was determined by measuring the rate of enzymatic activity as a\nfunction of varying substrate concentration in 100-\u03bcl reactions.\nReactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme to the wells of an\nassay plate containing varying concentrations of substrate. The final\nsubstrate concentrations varied over a range from 0 to 2\n\u03bcm. The final enzyme concentrations for each\n3CLpro studied were as follows: MERS-CoV\n3CLpro at 1 \u03bcm, SARS-CoV\n3CLpro at 100 nm, HKU5-CoV 3CLpro at\n250 nm, and HKU4-CoV 3CLpro at 200 nm.\nBecause 3CLpro enzymes cannot be saturated with this\nsubstrate at a substrate concentration that would still allow accurate\nfluorescent measurements without the inner filter effect, only the\napparent kcat/Km\nvalues can be determined from the slope of the line that results from a\nplot of the enzymatic activity (y axis), normalized for\nthe total enzyme concentration, against the substrate concentration\n(x axis).\n\nThe dependence of the enzymatic activity on the total enzyme\nconcentration was determined using the FRET-based assay described above.\nThe final enzyme concentrations were varied over a concentration range\nfrom 2 \u03bcm to 100 nm for MERS-CoV\n3CLpro, 500 to 10 nm for SARS-CoV\n3CLpro, 250 to 0.6 nm for HKU5-CoV\n3CLpro, and 200 to 10 nm for HKU4-CoV\n3CLpro. Reactions were initiated by the addition of\nsubstrate, at a final concentration of 2 \u03bcm, to the\nassay plates containing varying enzyme concentrations in the assay\nbuffer. Initial rates were determined from the initial slopes of the\nprogress curves at each enzyme concentration.\n\nThe rates of the 3CLpro-catalyzed reactions measured over a\nrange of enzyme concentrations can be fit to either Equation 1 or 2 to determine the values\nof the dissociation constant for the monomer-dimer equilibrium as well\nas the turnover numbers. Nonlinear regression and the program TableCurve\n2D version 4.0 were used to fit the data to either Equation 1 or 2 below (44).  In Equation 1,\nVmax is the rate of the enzymatic\nactivity calculated at each enzyme concentration\n(CT); Kd is\nthe monomer-dimer equilibrium dissociation constant, and\nkcat,\nM and kcat,\nD are the turnover numbers for the monomer\nand the dimer, respectively.  In Equation 2,\nVmax, CT,\nand Kd have been described previously, and\nkcat is the turnover number for the\ndimer only.\n\nTo determine the percent inhibition for compounds\n1\u20139, the total concentration of the substrate\nwas fixed at 1.0 \u03bcm, and the enzymes were fixed at 250\nnm for SARS-CoV 3CLpro, HKU5-CoV\n3CLpro, HKU4-CoV 3CLpro, and at 500\nnm for MERS-CoV 3CLpro. DMSO stocks\n(100\u00d7) of the compounds were diluted a hundred-fold to a final\nconcentration of 50 \u03bcm in 80 \u03bcl of the enzyme\nsolution and incubated for 20 min. After 20 min, the enzymatic activity\nwas measured as initial slope of the progress curve, obtained by\ninitiating the reaction with 20 \u03bcl of 5 \u03bcm\nsubstrate. % inhibition was calculated using Equation 3.  In Equation 3,\nratesample is the initial slope of the progress curve in\nAFU/s measured in the presence of the compound; ratepos is\nthe initial slope measured in the absence of any compound, and\nrateneg is the baseline substrate hydrolysis calculated\nin the absence of enzyme. All the reactions were carried out in\ntriplicate and contained a final DMSO concentration of 1%. For compounds\ndisplaying more than 50% inhibition, a more extensive characterization\nof the inactivation kinetics was performed through progress curve\nanalysis. To the reaction well, 20 \u03bcl of 5 \u03bcm\nsubstrate was added to a final concentration of 1 \u03bcm,\nand the total inhibitor concentration\n[I]total was varied from 0 to 50\n\u03bcm. The reaction was initiated with the addition of\n80 \u03bcl of MERS-CoV 3CLpro to a final concentration of\n500 nm. Fluorescence intensity was then measured over time as\nAFUt for a period of 70 min. Equation 4 describes the\nresulting time course of reaction.  In Equation 4,\nvi is the initial velocity of the\nreaction; kobs is the observed first-order\nrate constant for the reaction in the absence and presence of inhibitor;\nt is the time in minutes;\n[P]t is the\nconcentration of product produced at time t, and\n[P]i is the initial\nproduct concentration, which is zero. Product concentrations were\ncalculated from the values of AFUt, using\nthe experimentally determined fluorescence extinction coefficient. The\nresulting values of [P]t\nwere then plotted against time t, and the data were fit\nto Equation 4 with\n[P]i = 0 using the\nnonlinear regression program TableCurve 2D to derive the fitted\nparameters vi and\nkobs and their associated errors\n\u0394vi and\n\u0394kobs.\n\nValues for each kobs were then plotted\nagainst [I]total and the data were fit to\nEquation 5.\n In Equation 5,\nkinact defines the maximum rate of\ninactivation at infinite inhibitor concentration, and\nKI defines the concentration of\ninhibitor that yields a rate of inactivation equal to\n\u00bdkinact. The half-life of\ninactivation at infinite inhibitor concentration, which is a measure of\ninactivation efficiency, is defined as\nt\u00bd\u221e =\n0.693/kinact.\n\nTo determine the oligomeric state of MERS-CoV 3CLpro,\nsedimentation velocity experiments were performed at 20 \u00b0C on\nthe Beckman-Coulter XLA ultracentrifuge using varying concentrations of\nMERS-CoV 3CLpro (4\u201323 \u03bcm) in 25\nmm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm\ntris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine at 50,000 rpm. To characterize the effect\nof the ligand on the monomer-dimer equilibrium of MERS-CoV\n3CLpro, sedimentation velocity experiments were conducted\non the Beckman-Coulter XLI instrument using different stoichiometric\nratios of MERS-CoV 3CLpro with compounds 6 and\n10. Samples were prepared by mixing 25\n\u03bcm MERS-CoV 3CLpro with 25, 50, and 100\n\u03bcm compound 6 or 10 and\nincubating the mixture overnight at 4 \u00b0C before performing the\nexperiments. Absorbance optics (280 nm) and interference optics were\nutilized for protein detection. Solvent density, viscosity, and partial\nspecific volumes were calculated using SEDNTERP. SEDPHAT was used to fit\nthe data to the monomer-dimer self-association model to estimate the\nsedimentation coefficients (s), apparent molecular\nweights, and Kd and\nkoff values from size distribution\nanalysis. To obtain exact molecular weights, sedimentation equilibrium\nexperiments were performed at concentrations of 3 and 17\n\u03bcm MERS-CoV 3CLpro. The experiments were\ndone at 20 \u00b0C utilizing a two-channel centerpiece and run at\nmultiple speeds (8100, 13,800 and 24,000 rpm) in a AN-60 Ti rotor.\n\nThe rates of the MERS-CoV 3CLpro-catalyzed reactions were\ndetermined at final enzyme concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0\n\u03bcm and in the absence and presence of varying\nconcentrations (0.1\u201360 \u03bcm) of compound\n10. The substrate concentration was fixed at 2.0\n\u03bcm. DMSO stocks (100\u00d7) of compound\n10 were diluted a hundred-fold in 80 \u03bcl of\nenzyme solution and incubated for 10 min. At the same time, a\nzero-inhibitor control reaction was set up by mixing DMSO to a final\nconcentration of 1% into 80 \u03bcl of enzyme solution. After 10 min,\nthe rate of the enzymatic activity was measured as the initial slope of\nthe progress curve, obtained by initiating the reaction with 20\n\u03bcl of 10 \u03bcm substrate. Equation 6 was utilized to\ncalculate the percent activity.  The ratesample,\nratepos, and rateneg are as described above\nfor Equation 3.\n\nPurified MERS-CoV 3CLpro was concentrated to 1.6 mg/ml in 25\nmm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 2.5 mm DTT. Inhibitor\ncomplexes of MERS-CoV 3CLpro with compounds 6\nand 11 were formed by incubating MERS-CoV 3CLpro\nwith the compounds in a 1:3 stoichiometric ratio at 4 \u00b0C\novernight. After iterative rounds of optimization of the crystallization\nconditions based on the initial hits obtained from high throughput\nscreening of Qiagen Nextel Screens, crystals of MERS-CoV\n3CLpro inhibitor complexes suitable for x-ray diffraction\nwere grown by the hanging-drop, vapor diffusion method at 20 \u00b0C\nin 0.2 m sodium acetate, 0.1 m BisTris, pH 7.0, and\n20% PEG-3350 for the MERS-CoV 3CLpro and 6\ncomplex, and 0.2 m ammonium acetate, 0.1 m BisTris, pH\n5.5, 12% PEG-3350 for the MERS-CoV 3CLpro and 11\ncomplex. For x-ray data collection, crystals were flash-cooled in liquid\nnitrogen after dragging the crystals through a cryo-solution that\ncontained the crystallization solution supplemented with 15%\n2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol.\n\nX-ray diffraction data were collected for MERS-CoV 3CLpro and\n6 and MERS-CoV 3CLpro and 11\ncomplexes at the Lilly Research Laboratories Collaborative Access Team\n(LRL-CAT) Sector 31 and the Life Sciences Collaborative Access Team\n(LS-CAT) Sector 21 at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National\nLaboratory, respectively. Data were processed and scaled using Mosflm\nversion 7.0.5 (45) and HKL2000\nversion 706 (46). The method of\nmolecular replacement was used to obtain initial phases using the\nprogram PHASER-MR in Phenix suite version 1.8.4 (47). For MERS-CoV 3CLpro and\n6 complex, the x-ray structure of SARS-CoV\n3CLpro (PDB code 3V3M) was used as a phasing model\n(32). The final MERS-CoV\n3CLpro and 6 complex structure was then used\nto calculate the initial phases for the MERS-CoV 3CLpro and\n11 complex model. Automated model building using\nAutobuild in Phenix was initially used to build a preliminary model of\nthe MERS-CoV 3CLpro and 6 inhibitor complex.\nEach structure was then refined using iterative cycles of refinement\nusing Phenix Refine coupled to manual model building using COOT (48) based on\nFo \u2212\nFc and 2Fo\n\u2212 Fc maps. Coordinates and molecular\nlibrary files for inhibitor molecules were built using the program eLBOW\nin the Phenix suite. Water molecules were added to peaks in residual\n(Fo \u2212\nFc) density maps that were greater than\n3\u03c3 using the \u201cFind Water\u201d function in COOT.\nMolProbity was used to assess structural quality of the final model\n(49). The measured structure\nfactor amplitudes and the atomic coordinates for the final structures\nwere deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession codes 4RSP (MERS-CoV\n3CLpro and 6 complex) and 4YLU (MERS-CoV\n3CLpro and 11 complex), respectively.\nStructural superposition was performed using the method of least squares\nfitting of C-\u03b1 atoms in COOT. PyMOL was used to generate figures\nof all the structures (50).\n\nInsertion of the nsp4\u2193nsp5 cleavage site between the N-terminal\nHis6 tag and the coding region for MERS-CoV\n3CLpro results in autoprocessing of the His tag and\noverexpression of MERS-CoV 3CLpro without any N-terminal\nextension in E. coli BL21-DE3 cells. MERS-CoV\n3CLpro was purified to high purity and an overall yield\nof 10% using four sequential chromatographic steps. A summary of the\npercent enzyme yield, total activity units, and the fold-purification\nafter each chromatographic step is summarized in Table 1. Approximately 12 mg of highly pure MERS-CoV\n3CLpro can be obtained per liter of bacterial cell\nculture.\n\nTo verify the production of the enzyme with correct N and C termini, the\nmolecular mass of purified MERS-CoV 3CLpro was determined by\nMALDI to be 33.4 kDa, which is close to the theoretical molecular mass\nof 33.3 kDa for the authentic/mature MERS-CoV 3CLpro monomer.\nWestern blot analysis of purified MERS-CoV 3CLpro using an\nanti-His6 antibody also confirmed the absence of the N\nterminus His6 tag associated with the expression plasmid\n(data not shown). These results demonstrate that the N-terminal\nHis6 tag is auto-catalytically removed by MERS-CoV\n3CLpro during its expression in E. coli,\nindicating MERS-CoV 3CLpro is enzymatically active when\nexpressed in E. coli.\n\nA FRET-based peptide substrate was used to measure the enzymatic activity\nof MERS-CoV 3CLpro as a function of substrate concentration\nover a substrate concentration range from 0 to 2.0 \u03bcm\n(Fig. 1A). We\nobserved that MERS-CoV 3CLpro cannot be saturated by the\nsubstrate over this concentration range, which is typical for other\ncoronavirus 3CLpro enzymes because the\nKm values for peptide substrates\napproach 1 mm (51\u201354). Therefore, the slope of the kinetic\nresponse of MERS-CoV 3CLpro to increasing substrate\nconcentration was determined to derive an apparent\n(kcat/Km)\nvalue, which is a measure of enzymatic efficiency. We also determined\nand compared the apparent\n(kcat/Km)\nvalues for 3CLpro enzymes from SARS-CoV, HKU5-CoV, and\nHKU4-CoV under similar experimental conditions (Fig. 1B). MERS-CoV\n3CLpro is able to hydrolyze the peptide substrate;\nhowever, the enzymatic efficiency of MERS-CoV 3CLpro\n(kcat/Km =\n3.1 \u00b1 0.03 \u00d7 10\u22122\n\u03bcm\u22121 min\u22121)\nis noticeably lower than other 3CLpro enzymes tested.\nSpecifically, MERS-CoV 3CLpro was 5-fold less efficient at\nprocessing the peptide substrate when compared with SARS-CoV\n3CLpro. Even among the \u03b2-CoVs from the same 2c\ngenogroup (MERS, HKU5, and HKU4), MERS-CoV 3CLpro was the\nleast efficient enzyme.\n\nBecause a dimer has consistently been shown to be the catalytically\nactive form of all 3CLpro enzymes studied to date, we tested\nthe hypothesis that the lower enzymatic efficiency of MERS-CoV\n3CLpro is a result of the reduction in its ability to\ndimerize. Therefore, we determined the dependence of the enzymatic\nactivity of MERS-CoV 3CLpro on the total enzyme concentration\nand compared it with other 3CLpro enzymes from HKU4, HKU5,\nand SARS coronaviruses (Fig.\n2).\n\nIt is immediately apparent from the data plotted in Fig. 2 that the response of MERS-CoV\n3CLpro enzymatic activity to an increasing enzyme\nconcentration is nonlinear. The strong curvature suggests that a dimer\nis either the most active form or the only active form of MERS-CoV\n3CLpro. To determine the mechanism of dimerization, the\ndata in Fig. 2 were first fit to\nEquation 1 (see\n\u201cExperimental Procedures\u201d), which describes a model\nwhere both the monomer and the dimer are active. A fit of the data to\nEquation 1 yielded a\nnegative turnover value for the monomer\n(kcat,\nM), suggesting the monomer is inactive and\nthat the dimer is the only active form of the enzyme. Therefore, the\ndata were fit to Equation\n2 (see \u201cExperimental Procedures\u201d), which\nconsiders only the dimer as the active form of the enzyme. The kinetic\ndata for all four 3CLpro enzymes, MERS-CoV, HKU4-CoV,\nHKU5-CoV, and SARS-CoV, fit well to this model, and the resulting values\nfor the monomer-dimer equilibrium dissociation constant,\nKd, and apparent turnover number,\nkcat, for each enzyme are provided in\nTable 2.\n\nThe lower kcat value for MERS-CoV\n3CLpro, when compared with other coronavirus\n3CLpro enzymes, indicates a moderate reduction\n(2\u20134-fold) in its ability to turn over the substrate, which is\nconsistent with the observed lower apparent\n(kcat/Km)\nvalue. In contrast, there is a substantial reduction in the ability of\nMERS-CoV 3CLpro to dimerize compared with the other\n3CLpro enzymes. Based on the\nKd values, the capacity of MERS-CoV\n3CLpro to dimerize is \u223c78\u2013130-fold weaker\nthan the other enzymes (Table 2).\nThese results indicate that the MERS-CoV 3CLpro dimer is much\nmore weakly associated than the other coronavirus 3CLpro\nenzymes studied, and these results raise questions as to the structural\nand mechanistic differences among the 3CLpro enzymes that\nultimately regulate protease activity during coronavirus\nreplication.\n\nIn an effort to develop potent inhibitors of MERS-CoV 3CLpro,\nwe designed and synthesized nine peptidomimetic compounds containing a\nMichael acceptor group, i.e. an\n\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl, capable of irreversibly\nreacting with the active site cysteine of MERS-CoV 3CLpro\n(Table 3). These compounds\nwere designed and synthesized based on our understanding and knowledge\nof the interactions of similar inhibitor molecules with SARS-CoV\n3CLpro (30, 31). At a concentration of 50\n\u03bcm, compounds 6\u20139 displayed\nmore than 50% inhibition of MERS-CoV 3CLpro and were further\nevaluated for their ability to inactivate the enzyme in a time- and\nconcentration-dependent manner (Fig.\n3). Data from the kinetic progress curve for compound\n6 (Fig. 3), as\nwell as for compounds 7-9 (data not shown),\nwere fit to the appropriate equations (see under \u201cExperimental\nProcedures\u201d) to obtain the kinetic parameters,\nkinact,\nt\u00bd\u221e, and\nKI, and the resulting values are\nprovided in Table 3.\n\nWe identified four compounds, 6\u20139, as micromolar\ninhibitors of MERS-CoV 3CLpro with\nKI values less than 10\n\u03bcm (Table\n3). Analysis of structure-activity relationships of these\ncompounds suggests that the S2 subsite\npocket of MERS-CoV 3CLpro is small and can only accommodate a\nsmaller P2-isobutyl substituent (compounds\n6-9) but not bigger substituents such as\nP2-benzyl or\nP2-isobutylenyl (compounds\n1-5). It was also observed that replacing\nthe P4-ethoxy (compound 6) with\nP4-isopropoxy (compounds 7\nand 8) had no effect on the inhibitory activity of the\ncompounds. Finally, these compounds provide an excellent chemical\nscaffold to study the molecular details of interactions of\nsubstrate-like compounds with the enzyme and to develop more potent\ninhibitors of MERS-CoV 3CLpro for therapeutic\nintervention.\n\nTo evaluate broad spectrum specificity of these compounds, we also\ncalculated % inhibition of SARS-CoV 3CLpro, HKU5-CoV\n3CLpro, and HKU4-CoV 3CLpro after 20 min of\nincubation in the presence of 50 \u03bcm compounds\n6\u20139. Except for compound 9, which\ninhibited SARS-CoV 3CLpro by 76%, we observed 100% inhibition\nof all other enzymes in the presence of compounds\n6-9. Furthermore, we performed progress\ncurve analysis of HKU5-CoV 3CLpro and HKU4-CoV\n3CLpro in the presence of varying concentrations of\ncompounds 6\u20139. The KI\nvalues of compounds 6\u20139 for HKU5-CoV\n3CLpro are 0.49 \u00b1 0.16, 0.60 \u00b1 0.21, 1.30\n\u00b1 0.53, and 0.47 \u00b1 0.06 \u03bcm,\nrespectively. The KI values of compounds\n6\u20139 for HKU4-CoV 3CLpro are 0.39\n\u00b1 0.14, 0.50 \u00b1 0.17, 0.85 \u00b1 0.33, and 0.64\n\u00b1 0.25 \u03bcm, respectively. These data suggest\nthat peptidomimetic compounds 6\u20139 have the\npotential to be developed as coronavirus 3CLpro inhibitors\nwith broad spectrum specificity.\n\nTo further explore the mechanism of MERS-CoV 3CLpro\ndimerization, we performed analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation\nvelocity (AUC-SV) studies at varying concentrations of MERS-CoV\n3CLpro (Fig.\n4A). Unlike enzyme kinetics, AUC allows\ndetermination of the monomer-dimer equilibrium constant\n(Kd) in the absence of substrate.\nMERS-CoV 3CLpro displayed a continuous size distribution at\ndifferent protein concentrations. Two distinct peaks corresponding to\nmonomer (2.9 S) and dimer (3.9 S) species are observed, with the dimer\npeak becoming more pronounced at higher enzyme concentrations (Fig. 4A). We fit the\nAUC data to a monomer-dimer equilibrium model to determine the values\nfor Kd and koff,\nwhere Kd is the equilibrium dissociation\nconstant for a monomer from the dimer, and\nkoff is the rate constant for\ndissociation of the monomer from the dimer. The resulting best fit value\nfor Kd is 52 \u00b1 5 \u03bcm\nand that for koff is 10\u22124\ns\u22121. The Kd value of\n52 \u03bcm for MERS 3CLpro is dramatically\ndifferent from SARS-CoV 3CLpro, which has reported\nKd values ranging from low nanomolar\nup to 10 \u03bcm depending on the enzyme construct used and\nthe experimental conditions and methods utilized to determine the\ndissociation constant (37). The\ndimer affinity of MERS-CoV 3CLpro is substantially weaker\nthan that for SARS-CoV 3CLpro, when comparing the same enzyme\nconstruct, i.e. the enzyme without any N- or C-terminal\nmodifications. The AUC-SV calculated Kd\nvalue for MERS-CoV 3CLpro is \u223c150,000 times higher\nthan the value of 0.35 nm determined for SARS-CoV\n3CLpro (34).\n\nThe AUC results (Fig.\n4A) show that the monomer peak at\n\u223c2.9S does not gradually shift peak position toward the dimer\npeak at \u223c3.9S with increasing concentrations of MERS-CoV\n3CLpro; rather, the two peaks change in area, which is\nindicative of very slow monomer-dimer exchange rate\n(koff \u223c10\u22124\ns\u22121) and the formation of hydrodynamically stable\nmonomer and dimer species (55).\nThis koff value is 1000 times slower than\nthe koff value (10\u22121\ns\u22121) reported for SARS-CoV 3CLpro\nindicating that the SARS-CoV enzyme has a significantly more rapid\nmonomer-dimer exchange rate (56).\nThese observations support a model whereby the MERS-CoV\n3CLpro dimer is weakly associated, suggesting the enzyme\nexists mainly as a monomer in solution.\n\nThe weak association of MERS-CoV 3CLpro monomers engenders the\nfollowing questions. \u201cAre higher levels of expression of\n3CLpro in MERS-CoV-infected cells necessary to allow\nformation of active dimer?\u201d \u201cAre other mechanisms such\nas substrate- or ligand-induced dimerizations involved in activating\n3CLpro?\u201d To explore the latter question of\nligand-induced dimerization of MERS-CoV 3CLpro, we performed\nAUC experiments in the presence of compound 6, which acts\nas a substrate mimetic and mechanism-based inhibitor, also known as a\nsuicide substrate. Peptidomimetic compounds such as compound\n6, which contains a Michael acceptor group, interact\nand react with the active site cysteine of cysteine proteases to\ncovalently modify them. We utilized compound 6 to form a\ncovalent MERS-CoV 3CLpro and inhibitor 6 complex\nthat is stable over long periods of time, making it amenable to analysis\nby AUC-SV experiments. In contrast, incubation of a normal peptide\nsubstrate with the enzyme would lead to immediate hydrolysis of the\nsubstrate and dissociation of the products from the enzyme, confounding\nAUC experiments and subsequent data analysis.\n\nMERS-CoV 3CLpro was incubated with varying concentrations of\ncompound 6 in stoichiometric ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:4.\nThe modified enzyme was then subjected to AUC studies to determine the\ninfluence of compound 6 on the monomer-dimer equilibrium\n(Fig. 4B). A\nsignificant shift in the area under 2.9S peak (monomer) to 4.1S peak\n(dimer) is detected upon addition of increasing concentrations of\ncompound 6. We obtained similar results when AUC studies\nwere performed utilizing a complex of MERS-CoV 3CLpro with a\nnoncovalent peptidomimetic inhibitor (compound 10, Figs. 4C). The\ntransition of MERS-CoV 3CLpro from monomer to dimer in the\npresence of compounds 6 and 10 suggests that\nthe enzyme undergoes extensive dimerization upon substrate binding.\n\nThe observed ligand-induced dimerization of MERS-CoV 3CLpro,\nas demonstrated through AUC studies, prompted us to investigate whether\nor not the enzymatic activity of MERS-CoV 3CLpro could be\nincreased at low concentrations of a compound via ligand-induced\ndimerization. To do so, we chose to use a noncovalent peptidomimetic\ncompound (compound 10, Fig.\n5A) that we previously identified as an\ninhibitor of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Because of the time-dependent,\nirreversible nature of the reaction between compound 6 and\nMERS-CoV 3CLpro, use of compound 6 was not ideal\nfor these kinetic studies as it would further complicate kinetic data\nanalysis.\n\nThe kinetic response of MERS-CoV 3CLpro to increasing\nconcentrations of compound 10 was first measured at a\nsingle enzyme concentration of 1.0 \u03bcm (Fig. 5A).\nInterestingly, an increase in the activity of MERS-CoV\n3CLpro, as high as 195%, was observed in the presence of low\ninhibitor concentrations (0.1 to 20 \u03bcm). Inhibition of\nenzymatic activity was observed only at higher inhibitor concentrations\n(40 \u03bcm or greater). These results suggest that at low\nconcentrations, compound 10 binds to a monomer and induces\nthe formation of a dimer. The resulting dimer then has one free active\nsite that is capable of processing the substrate. At higher\nconcentrations of inhibitor, the substrate and inhibitor directly\ncompete for the free active site.\n\nThe model of activation and inhibition suggested by the data at 1\n\u03bcm enzyme would predict that at higher enzyme\nconcentrations less activation by a compound would be observed at lower\ninhibitor concentrations, and the inhibition of activity would be\ndetected at lower inhibitor concentrations because the equilibrium would\nbe pushed toward dimer formation. In contrast, lower enzyme\nconcentrations would result in higher activation by compounds, and\ninhibition by the compound would occur at significantly higher compound\nconcentrations. Therefore, we further measured the activity of MERS-CoV\n3CLpro at two additional enzyme concentrations (0.5 and\n2.0 \u03bcm) in the presence of varying concentrations of\ncompound 10. Remarkably, we observed that the activation\neffect was most pronounced at the lowest MERS-CoV 3CLpro\nconcentration tested (0.5 \u03bcm), and the effect decreased\nas the enzyme concentration was increased (1.0 and 2.0\n\u03bcm) (Fig.\n5A). Moreover, inhibition by compound\n10 occurred at lower compound concentrations when\nhigher concentrations of enzyme were used. These observations further\nsupport a model whereby enzyme activation can occur through\nligand-induced dimerization.\n\nThe activation and inhibition of MERS-CoV 3CLpro by compound\n10 can be explained by a simple kinetic model depicted\nin Fig. 5B. The\nMERS-CoV 3CLpro monomer exists in equilibrium with the dimer,\nand their relative concentrations depend on the total enzyme\nconcentration. In the absence of substrate or compound, the\nKd value is 52 \u03bcm,\nand the equilibrium is represented by the gray spheres\n(blue box) in Fig.\n5B. The monomer is unable to hydrolyze the\nsubstrate and is therefore inactive. Binding of inhibitor (Fig. 5B, green\ntriangle) to the monomer results in monomer to dimer switch\nleading to the formation of a dimer that contains inhibitor bound in one\nof the active sites. Once the dimer is formed, the substrate binds in\nthe second active site and catalysis takes place. Under high inhibitor\nconcentrations, however, the inhibitor molecule directly competes with\nsubstrate for the free dimer active site, and inhibition of the\nenzymatic activity is observed as a result.\n\nWe would also expect to observe induced dimerization and activation in\nthe presence of the substrate. Indeed, the monomer-dimer kinetic studies\nperformed in Fig. 2 were performed\nat a fixed concentration of substrate at 2 \u03bcm. In this\nexperiment, the Kd value for the MERS-CoV\n3CLpro dimer was determined to be 7.8\n\u03bcm, which is lower than the\nKd value determined in the absence of\nsubstrate using AUC, thereby supporting substrate-induced dimerization.\nGiven the high Km value of 3CLpro\nfor the peptide substrate (51\u201354), even higher substrate\nconcentrations would be required to observe substrate activation in a\nplot of catalytic activity versus substrate\nconcentration. However, we are limited to use our FRET-based substrate\nonly at low concentrations due to a significant inner filter effect at\nhigher concentrations of substrate. Therefore, a compound that both\nmimics substrate and has higher binding affinity can act as a useful\nsurrogate for the substrate, allowing the observation of ligand-induced\ndimerization and activation even at low substrate concentrations.\n\nTo gain atomic level detail and molecular insight into the mechanism for\nsubstrate-induced dimerization of MERS-CoV 3CLpro, we\nattempted to crystallize and determine the x-ray structures of the\nunliganded MERS-CoV 3CLpro monomer and the MERS-CoV\n3CLpro covalently modified with compound 6.\nUnfortunately, we were unable to crystallize the unliganded MERS-CoV\n3CLpro monomer after multiple attempts, but we were able\nto crystallize and determine the x-ray structure of MERS-CoV\n3CLpro in complex with compound 6 to a\nresolution of 1.6 \u212b. The statistics for x-ray data collection,\nprocessing, and refinement are summarized in Table 4. The MERS-CoV 3CLpro and\n6 complex crystallized as a biologically relevant,\nsymmetrical dimer in space group C2 with one monomer in\nthe asymmetric unit. Electron density for the entire protein was clearly\nvisible and strong electron density (Fo\n\u2212 Fc >4\u03c3) was\npresent for compound 6 within the active site (Fig. 6A).\n\nThe active site of MERS-CoV 3CLpro bound with compound\n6 is shown in Fig.\n6, A and B. Compound\n6 is covalently bound to the active site cysteine\n(Cys-148) via a 1.8 \u212b bond between the \u03b3-sulfur and the\nelectrophilic \u03b2-carbon of the Michael acceptor. The\nP\u20321-ethyl ester carbonyl, which\nmimics the carbonyl of the scissile bond in a substrate, forms a\nhydrogen bond with the backbone NH of Gly-146 that forms part of the\noxyanion hole (Fig.\n6B). Within the\nS1 subsite, the\nP1-lactam carbonyl, which is a surrogate\nfor the amide of P1-glutamine of substrates,\nparticipates in a hydrogen bonding interaction with the imidazole ring\nof His-166, and the P1-lactam NH forms a\nhydrogen bond with the carboxylate oxygen of Glu-169. The\nP2-backbone amide NH forms a hydrogen\nbond with the side chain carbonyl of Gln-192 (Fig. 6B). The\nP2-leucine side chain atoms of the\ninhibitor make hydrophobic contacts with the side chains of Met-168 and\nLeu-49 that line the S2 subsite pocket.\nMoreover, compared with the equivalent residue Thr-25 in SARS-CoV\n3CLpro, Met-25 in the S2\npocket of MERS-CoV 3CLpro is expected to reduce the size of\nthe hydrophobic pocket, which is supported by our observed SAR described\nabove.\n\nThe smaller size of the S2 pocket in MERS-CoV\n3CLpro is also consistent with the preference for a\nsmaller leucine residue at the P2 position\nof cleavage sites instead of a bulkier phenylalanine or methionine\nresidue. Indeed, analysis of the preference for leucine or phenylalanine\nat the P2 position for the 11\n3CLpro cleavage sites within the polyprotein of MERS-CoV\nshows that none of the 11 cleavage sites contain a phenylalanine residue\nat this position (Fig.\n6C). Leucine is the predominantly favored\nresidue at this position followed by methionine. Analysis of the\ncleavage sites from SARS-CoV, HKU4-CoV, and HKU5-CoV shows that none of\nthe 11 cleavage sites from group 2c members (MERS-CoV, HKU4-CoV, and\nHKU5-CoV) contain a phenylalanine residue at the\nP2 position; however, the SARS-CoV\nnsp5\u2193nsp6 cleavage site contains a phenylalanine residue at this\nposition.\n\nOther interactions are also observed to play a significant role in\nstabilizing the MERS-CoV 3CLpro-compound 6\ncomplex. The P3-carbonyl and\nP3-NH participate in hydrogen bonding\ninteractions with the backbone NH and carbonyl of Glu-169. The\nP4-serine side chain is within hydrogen\nbonding distance of the side chain carboxamide of Gln-195 and the\nbackbone carbonyl of Lys-191.\n\nWe were also able to obtain diffraction quality crystals of MERS-CoV\n3CLpro in complex with compound 11, which\nhas an almost identical chemical structure as that of compound\n10 (Fig.\n6D). We previously showed that compounds\nsimilar to 10 and 11 act as potent noncovalent\ninhibitors of 3CLpro from SARS-CoV (33). The x-ray structure of compound\n11 bound to MERS-CoV 3CLpro was determined\nto a resolution of 2.1 \u212b and the x-ray data collection,\nprocessing, and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 4. The MERS-CoV\n3CLpro and 11 complex crystallized in space\ngroup P21 with two biologically relevant\ndimers in the asymmetric unit. The overall root mean square deviation\nbetween the C-\u03b1 atoms of the four chains was less than 1\n\u212b, with the highest C-\u03b1 root mean square deviation of\n0.719 \u212b between chains C and D. Strong electron density\n(Fo \u2212\nFc >4\u03c3) was present for\ncompound 11 within all the four active sites of the two\ndimers (Fig.\n6D).\n\nThe binding orientation for compound 11 in the active site\nof MERS-CoV 3CLpro is similar to the binding orientation of\nrelated compounds in the active site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro (PDB\ncode 4MDS).\nThe benzotriazole group binds in the S1\nsubsite; phenyl propionamidyl occupies the\nS\u20321-S2 subsite, and\nthe thiophene group binds in the S2 subsite.\nCompound 11 also forms two direct and one water-mediated\nhydrogen bond interactions with amino acids in the MERS-CoV\n3CLpro active site (Fig.\n6E). The N3 of the\nbenzotriazole ring forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain\n\u03f5-nitrogen of conserved His-166, and the central acetamide\noxygen forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone NH of conserved Glu-169.\nThe NH of the phenyl propionamidyl group interacts with backbone\ncarbonyl oxygen of the catalytic His-41 residue through a water-mediated\nhydrogen bond, and the imidazole ring of His-41 engages with the phenyl\nring of phenyl propionamidyl group through T-shaped \u03c0 stacking.\nThe phenyl ring also form hydrophobic contacts with Leu-49.\n\nAnalysis of the MERS-CoV 3CLpro and 6 and\nMERS-CoV 3CLpro and 11 crystal structures\nreveals key differences between the dimer interface of MERS-CoV and\nSARS-CoV 3CLpro (PDB code 2ALV) (Fig. 7) (30). Two\narginine residues, Arg-4 and Arg-298 (Fig.\n7, A\u2013C), form some of the key\ninteractions at the dimer interface of SARS-CoV 3CLpro, and\nmutation of either of these amino acids results in a drastic loss of\ndimerization in SARS-CoV 3CLpro (36, 38). Interestingly, these two arginine residues (Arg-4 and\nArg-298) are substituted in MERS-CoV 3CLpro by two\nhydrophobic residues (Val-4 and Met-298) that are unable to participate\nin the formation of hydrogen bonds or salt bridges. Therefore, we\ninitially thought that the loss of these key interactions might simply\nexplain the >100,000-fold weaker dimerization observed for\nMERS-CoV 3CLpro compared with SARS-CoV 3CLpro.\nSurprisingly, however, structural analysis of the dimer interface from\nthe available x-ray structure of HKU4-CoV 3CLpro (PDB code\n2YNB;\nFig. 7, B and\nC), and primary sequence alignment of\n3CLpro from MERS-CoV, HKU5-CoV, HKU4-CoV and SARS-CoV\n(Fig. 8) revealed that Val-4\nand Met-298 are conserved between all the \u03b2-CoV 2c members\nstudied here. Substantial differences between the ability of MERS-CoV\n3CLpro and HKU4/HKU5-CoV 3CLpro to dimerize,\ndespite their high sequence identity, led us to the hypothesis that\nnonconserved residues between MERS-CoV and other \u03b2-CoV 2c\nmembers that are remote from the dimer interface may play a significant\nrole in dimer formation.\n\nAnalysis of our current crystal structures does not reveal a clear\nmechanism for the monomer to dimer switch of MERS-CoV 3CLpro\nupon ligand binding. Therefore, we attempted to identify the\nnonconserved residues in MERS-CoV 3CLpro that might affect\nenzymatic activity due to their proximity to key residues involved in\nsubstrate binding and/or dimer formation.\n\nBased on a sequence alignment, MERS-CoV 3CLpro contains\n\u223c24 nonconserved amino acids (pink arrows in\nFig. 8). Upon analyzing the\nposition of these amino acids in the crystal structure, we observed that\na remarkable number of these amino acids are present in the loop\nregions. Fig. 9A\nillustrates the nonconserved residues present in the loop regions as\ngray (monomer A) and pink (monomer\nB) spheres. Interestingly, we also observed that there are hot spots in\nthe protein structure where most of these amino acids are clustered.\nThese hot spots include the N-terminal region, the active site region,\nthe inter-domain loop (loop between the catalytic fold and domain III),\nand the domain III. In MERS-CoV 3CLpro, nonconserved amino\nacid His-8, which forms van der Waals contacts with Lys-155 of the same\nmonomer and Thr-128 of the other monomer, is present at the end of the\nN-terminal finger (Fig. 9,\nB and C), whereas amino acids\nAsp-12 and Ala-15 are part of the N-terminal helix (Fig. 9B). Additionally, amino acids\nThr-128, Lys-155, and Ser-158 are present within 6 \u212b of the\nN-terminal region (Fig.\n9B). Substitution to these amino acids in\nMERS-CoV 3CLpro might have changed the protein dynamics in a\nway that only ligand binding populates the monomer conformation, which\nis more amenable to dimer formation.\n\nWe also observe that some of the nonconserved residues in MERS-CoV\n3CLpro are located in proximity to the substrate-binding\nsite and might contribute toward ligand-induced dynamic changes\nfavorable for dimer formation. For example, nonconserved amino acid\nMet-61 forms hydrophobic interactions with Met-43, which in turn is in\nclose proximity to the catalytic residue His-41 (Fig. 9D). Residue Ala-171 is\npresent on a loop, and this loop, along with conserved residues His-166\nand His-175, forms the S1 subsite for\nbinding the P1 amino acid of the substrate\n(Fig. 9E). In\naddition to its influence on substrate binding, Ala-171 may also\ncontribute toward dimer formation upon substrate binding due to its\nclose proximity with Glu-169. This glutamate residue in SARS-CoV\n3CLpro (Glu-166) has been established as a key residue\nlinking the substrate-binding site to the dimer interface (56). Val-132 forms hydrophobic\ninteraction with other nonconserved residue Ala-114 within domain II\n(Fig. 9F).\nAdditionally, Val-132 is present within van der Waals contact distance\nof Glul-290 from extra-helical domain III (Fig. 9F). It is noteworthy that Glu-290\nforms a salt bridge with Arg-4 across the dimer interface in SARS-CoV\n3CLpro. However, this interaction is not formed in\nMERS-CoV 3CLpro due to the substitution of Arg-4 with Val-4.\nTyr-137 forms hydrophobic contacts with the conserved residue Tyr-185\n(Fig. 9G).\n\nBesides amino acid Val-132 that connects domains II and III, residue\nTyr-185, along with two other nonconserved residues, Thr-183 and\nMet-189, is present on the inter-domain loop that connects the catalytic\nfold (domains I and II) with the extra-helical domain III (Fig. 9G).\nFlexibility within these residues might affect the orientation of domain\nIII required for dimer formation.\n\nEnzymatic activity of coronavirus 3CLpro is required for the\nprocessing of viral polyproteins at 11 distinct cleavage sites, allowing\nthe release of nonstructural proteins that subsequently form a\nreplication complex for virus genome replication. Because of its\nindispensable role in the virus life cycle, regulation of the enzymatic\nactivity of 3CLpro is instrumental for efficient replication\nof coronaviruses. Based on our experimental results, we propose a model\nto explain the mechanism for regulating the enzymatic activity of\nMERS-CoV 3CLpro in the context of polyprotein processing\nduring virus infection (Fig.\n10).\n\nA number of in vitro studies performed on SARS-CoV\n3CLpro have established the mechanism for\n3CLpro auto-release from the polyprotein (34, 39, 40). Based upon these\nstudies and our data on MERS-CoV 3CLpro, we propose the\npolyprotein processing model in Fig.\n10. The steps proposed for auto-release of MERS-CoV\n3CLpro from the polyprotein (steps\n1\u20134, Fig. 10)\nhave been adapted from Chen et al. (39), where it is suggested that the\nN-terminal auto-processing does not require the formation of a mature\n3CLpro dimer for SARS-CoV. Based on the differences\nbetween the properties of SARS-CoV 3CLpro and MERS-CoV\n3CLpro, as highlighted in our studies, we added two\nadditional steps (steps 5 and 6, Fig. 10) that MERS-CoV\n3CLpro may need to utilize for efficient polyprotein\nprocessing. In Fig. 10,\nstep 1, two immature MERS-CoV 3CLpro\nmonomers in the polyprotein approach each other and form an immature\ndimer via interactions between domain III, which allows each of the\nmonomers to insert their N termini into the active site of the other\nmonomer. In step 2, the N termini are cleaved, and the\ndimer with uncleaved C termini adopts a conformation similar to the\nmature dimer. Our observation of auto-cleavage of the N-terminal\nHis6 tag from MERS-CoV 3CLpro during\nexpression in bacterial cells supports steps 1 and\n2, where formation of an immature dimer capable of\nauto-processing the N terminus occurs. In step 3, two\ndimers with uncleaved C termini approach each other, followed by\ninsertion of the C terminus from one dimer into one of the active sites\nof the other dimer. In step 4, the C termini are\ncleaved and mature dimer is released from the polyprotein.\n\nFor SARS-CoV, the 3CLpro dimer formed in step\n4 continues to process cleavage sites in the polyprotein,\neffectively skipping steps 5 and 6\n(red arrow in Fig.\n10) because the dimer is tightly associated. However, the\nhigh Kd value of MERS-CoV 3CLpro\ndimer suggests that the active and mature dimer may dissociate into\ninactive, mature monomers in the absence of any ligand (step\n5). In order for polyprotein processing to proceed, another\nstep (step 6) must occur. In step 6, a\nsubstrate S, e.g. one of the 11 polyprotein cleavage\nsites, would induce dimer formation and hence activate catalysis and\ncleavage at the substrate recognition sites. Our AUC results and the\nkinetic activation studies performed in the absence and presence of\ninhibitors support steps 5 and 6 where\nthe inactive but mature monomers require binding of a ligand to undergo\nligand-induced dimerization and formation of an active, mature dimer\nthat can then process the polyprotein cleavage sites.\n\nLong range interactions have been reported to modulate dimerization and\nactivity of 3CLpro enzymes. Barrila et al.\n(57) demonstrated that\nmutation of a conserved amino acid Ser-147, which is distant from the\ndimer interface, results in a total loss of dimerization and enzymatic\nactivity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Although Ser-147 does not form\ndirect interactions at the dimer interface, disruption of the dimer upon\nmutation stems from the fact that Ser-147 makes several interactions\nwith other residues involved in forming a hydrogen bonding network\nwithin SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Site-directed mutagenesis studies on\ndomain III of SARS-CoV 3CLpro, where N214A and\nS284A/T285A/I286A mutants were characterized, revealed that despite\nbeing present on an entirely different domain, these residues affect\ncatalysis through a network of residues undergoing correlated motions\nacross the entire protease (58,\n59). Utilizing\n3CLpro temperature-sensitive mutants of MHV, Stobart\net al. (60)\nhave also demonstrated that second-site mutation physically distant from\nthe temperature-sensitive mutation suppresses the temperature-sensitive\nphenotype through long range interactions, thereby regulating\n3CLpro enzymatic activity during polyprotein processing\nand virus replication.\n\nOur studies also suggest that long range interactions among the\nnonconserved residues can significantly alter the properties of MERS-CoV\n3CLpro. A detailed analysis of nonconserved residues of\nMERS-CoV 3CLpro among \u03b2-CoV 2c members identified hot\nspots, including the N-terminal finger and helix, the active site\nregion, the inter-domain loop, and the domain III, where these residues\nare clustered. Several studies done on SARS-CoV 3CLpro have\ndemonstrated that amino acids from the N-terminal finger, the N-terminal\nhelix, and domain III significantly contribute toward dimer\nformation.\n\nIn addition to the direct interactions at the dimer interface, correct\norientation between the catalytic fold and domain III is also crucial\nfor dimer formation. Wu et al. (61) showed that the most dramatic difference\nbetween the crystal structures of monomer and the ligand-bound dimer of\nthe R298A mutant of SARS-CoV 3CLpro was a 33\u00b0\nrotation of domain III (38). This\nrotation results in a steric clash between domain III from two monomers\nand would essentially block dimer formation. However, upon addition of a\nligand, domain III of the R298A mutant adopts the correct orientation\nand results in the formation of a dimer structure. Similar to the\nSARS-CoV 3CLpro R298A mutant, ligand binding into the active\nsite of the MERS-CoV 3CLpro monomer possibly stabilizes the\ninter-domain loop conformation that maintains domain III in the correct\norientation for dimer formation. Most of the nonconserved residues\nwithin domain III are present on the surface and also are distant from\nthe dimer interface. These residues may be involved in providing the\nflexibility required for conformational changes during the monomer to\ndimer switch.\n\nWe have identified several amino acids in MERS-CoV 3CLpro that\nmay contribute to the dimer formation upon ligand binding. However,\nsingle amino acid mutagenesis alone is unlikely to reveal significant\ndifferences in the dimerization properties. As demonstrated by Myers\net al. (62)\nfor ornithine decarboxylase, the response of single amino acid to ligand\nbinding may be limited to only local conformational changes and may not\nhave significant contribution toward dimer stability. However, local\nconformational changes in a network of residues may propagate larger\neffects that stabilize dimer formation upon ligand binding. Analysis of\nthe nonconserved residues of MERS-CoV 3CLpro discussed here\nsets forth a framework to perform systematic single or multiple\nmutagenesis studies to gain insights into the mechanism for\nligand-induced dimerization of the enzyme.\n\nInsights into the mechanistic and structural similarities as well as\ndifferences between 3CLpro enzymes from different coronavirus\nsubgroups are instrumental for the development of 3CLpro\ninhibitors with broad spectrum specificity. To evaluate the broad\nspectrum specificity of our peptidomimetic compounds, we determined\ntheir inhibitory activity against 3CLpro from MERS-CoV,\nSARS-CoV, HKU5-CoV, and HKU4-CoV. Our inhibitory data and\nKI values clearly show that\ncompounds 6\u20139 inhibit all the 3CLpro\nenzymes tested here. The x-ray structure of MERS-CoV 3CLpro\nin complex with compound 6 revealed that out of eight\ndirect hydrogen bonds formed between compound 6 and\nMERS-CoV 3CLpro, four of these hydrogen bonds involve\ninteractions with conserved structural elements of the peptide backbone\nof the enzyme. Furthermore, the amino acids that form hydrogen bonds\nwith compound 6 through side chain interactions are\nconserved in all the coronavirus 3CLpro enzymes evaluated\nhere, as well as 3CLpro enzymes from other\n\u03b2-coronaviruses like MHV, OC43, and HKU1. These results suggest\nthat canonical structural features exist among the 3CLpro\nenzymes that can be exploited for structure-based design of broad\nspectrum inhibitors.\n\nFor the noncovalent inhibitor compound 11, the x-ray\nstructure reveals two direct hydrogen bonding interactions between the\ncompound and MERS-CoV 3CLpro. One of the hydrogen bonds forms\nwith the side chain \u03f5-nitrogen of conserved His-166, and the\nsecond involves the backbone NH of conserved Glu-169. We speculate these\ninteractions remain conserved in other 3CLpro enzymes as\nwell, because His-166 and Glu-169 amino acids are conserved in all\n3CLpro enzymes. In fact, the crystal structure of\nSARS-CoV 3CLpro in complex with an inhibitor similar to\ncompound 11 (PDB code 4MDS) reveals that the interactions of\nthe inhibitor with the amino acids His-166 and Glu-169 are\nconserved.\n\nThe identification of 3CLpro-inhibitor interactions utilizing\nconserved elements of the protein structure, including the peptide\nbackbone and conserved side chains of active site residues, suggests\nthat the development of broad-spectrum inhibitors of coronavirus\n3CLpro is feasible.\n\nOur studies here demonstrate the unique properties of MERS-CoV\n3CLpro among \u03b2-CoV 2c members, evident from the\nrequirement for a ligand to induce dimerization. Although the\npeptidomimetic compounds containing a Michael acceptor group (for\nexample, compounds 6\u20139) induce dimer formation of\nMERS-CoV 3CLpro, the irreversible nature of their reaction\nwith the active site cysteine ensures complete inhibition of the enzyme\nat stoichiometric ratios in a time-dependent manner. On the contrary,\nnoncovalent peptidomimetic compounds (for example, compounds\n10 and 11) inhibit the enzymatic activity\nof MERS-CoV 3CLpro only at high compound concentrations.\nBased on these observations, compounds that irreversibly modify the\n3CLpro active site may serve as better candidates for the\ndevelopment of inhibitors for MERS-CoV 3CLpro.\n\nInduced dimerization of MERS-CoV 3CLpro, as seen in the\npresence of peptidomimetic inhibitors, has significant implications in\nthe development of antiviral agents targeting MERS-CoV\n3CLpro. As a consequence of enzyme activation, the\ndevelopment of an effective antiviral agent may necessitate the\ndevelopment of a compound that can inhibit the MERS-CoV\n3CLpro monomer and stabilize it without inducing\ndimerization and/or inhibit the active sites of the dimer at low doses,\nensuring inactivation of both the active sites within the dimer. On the\ncontrary, it is also possible that the presence of an inhibitor could\nenhance the activity of MERS-CoV 3CLpro to an extent that\nresults in a complete loss of the temporal and spatial regulation of the\nenzymatic activity, thereby disrupting viral genome replication.\nRamifications of ligand-induced dimerization and activation of MERS-CoV\n3CLpro, as seen in the presence of lower concentrations\nof inhibitor, will need to be further explored in virus-infected\ncells.\n\nS.
