{"title": "Risk factors for the evolutionary emergence of pathogens", "body": "The recent outbreaks of SARS coronavirus and avian and swine influenza strains have highlighted the importance of pathogen cross-species transmission, and subsequent evolutionary adaption, in the emergence of new diseases (Woolhouse et al. 2005; Dennehy 2009). Such \u2018species jumps\u2019 have been proposed as a major source of novel pathogen introductions (Woolhouse et al. 2005; Day et al. 2006; Kuiken et al. 2006), and indeed many emerging human diseases are zoonotic (Cleaveland et al. 2001; Taylor et al. 2001). Typically, these pathogens are initially poorly adapted to humans because of physiological differences between species (Kuiken et al. 2006). Thus, significant spread of these pathogens within the human population often requires evolutionary adaptation (Dennehy 2009).\n\nA number of risk factors have been proposed to explain why some pathogens emerge and others do not. These include the breadth of the pathogen's host range (Cleaveland et al. 2001; Taylor et al. 2001; Woolhouse & Gaunt 2007), susceptibility of the host (Woolhouse et al. 2005; Woolhouse & Gaunt 2007), contact patterns in the host population (Woolhouse et al. 2005; Kuiken et al. 2006; Woolhouse & Gaunt 2007; Dennehy 2009), the mechanism(s) of pathogen adaptation (e.g. whether recombination is possible; Woolhouse et al. 2005), pathogen taxonomic classification (Cleaveland et al. 2001; Taylor et al. 2001), pathogen generation time (Cleaveland et al. 2001; Taylor et al. 2001) or growth rate (Dennehy 2009) and pathogen mutability (Cleaveland et al. 2001; Taylor et al. 2001; Woolhouse et al. 2005; Dennehy 2009). Indeed, empirical studies have revealed that some of these factors are often associated with emerging diseases (Cleaveland et al. 2001; Taylor et al. 2001; Woolhouse & Gaunt 2007). In particular, viruses and protozoa display a relatively high propensity for being involved in newly emerging human diseases (Cleaveland et al. 2001; Taylor et al. 2001), and the degree of transmissibility between members of the new host species also appears to be a risk factor where data are available (Taylor et al. 2001).\n\nThe association between transmissibility and likelihood of emergence is, perhaps, not surprising. Any factor that increases the expected number of transmitted infections, such as higher initial transmissibility between members of the new host species, means that the pathogen can circulate for longer after the cross-species jump, and thus has greater potential for ultimate evolutionary adaptation (Antia et al. 2003). For the same reason, patterns of contact among hosts should also play an important role in disease emergence, because some contact structures ought to lead to greater scope for transmission than others. To date, however, the most \u2018risky\u2019 patterns of host contact are not known.\n\nThe association between pathogen taxonomic classification and likelihood of emergence is less easy to explain. It has been suggested that the high incidence of emergence among viruses may be attributed, at least partially, to their high mutation rates (particularly in RNA viruses). A high mutation rate might lead to a greater likelihood of the appropriate adaptive mutations occurring, implying greater evolutionary potential (Cleaveland et al. 2001; Woolhouse et al. 2005). On the other hand, most mutations are deleterious, and a high mutation rate could thereby increase the chance of pathogen extinction (Dennehy 2009). Indeed, this propensity for extinction might be exploited clinically by drug-induced \u2018lethal mutagenesis\u2019 (Anderson et al. 2004; Clementi 2008). Thus, it remains unclear whether higher mutation rates do indeed lead to a higher likelihood of evolutionary emergence, or whether other processes are required to explain the empirical patterns.\n\nIn this paper, we investigate the above factors through mathematical modelling. We ask two main questions: (i) what types of host contact structure lead to the greatest risk of evolutionary emergence? and (ii) how do patterns of mutation affect the risk of evolutionary emergence? We address these questions using a branching process model that tracks the number of infected hosts as a newly introduced pathogen spreads and evolves. There have been two main approaches to using such models in the epidemiological literature, a network-based approach and a phenomenological approach. The former explicitly considers the patterns of contact among individuals in the population and the probability of transmission through any given contact (e.g. Brauer 2008), but has not, to date, allowed for evolution. The latter assumes that the population is well mixed and in some cases allows for evolution, but has not explicitly modelled the contact patterns among individuals (e.g. Antia et al. 2003; Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005; Day et al. 2006; Yates et al. 2006; Reluga et al. 2007). In order to address the above questions, we place these two approaches within a common framework, generalizing to allow for arbitrary contact patterns and arbitrary pathways of evolutionary adaptation.\n\nWe model in discrete time, using a Galton\u2013Watson process. To define the branching process, we require a distribution for the number of \u2018offspring\u2019 produced by each individual. In the present context, infected hosts are the individuals of interest, and an \u2018offspring\u2019 is viewed as a contact to whom the infection is transmitted. The network-based approach and the phenomenological approach arrive at this offspring distribution in different ways. The network-based approach builds up the offspring distribution from underlying assumptions about the processes of host\u2013host contact and pathogen transmission. The phenomenological approach, on the other hand, simply specifies this offspring distribution directly, without explicit consideration of the underlying contact and transmission processes through which it might arise.\n\nThe network-based approach represents the host population by a graph: each vertex or node corresponds to an individual, and an edge between two nodes signifies that the two individuals are acquaintances, i.e. can contact and potentially transmit disease to one another. We assume that this network is static, and restrict attention to random graphs in the limit of infinite population size. In this situation, the network becomes a tree graph, with the number of \u2018branches\u2019 from each node drawn independently from the arbitrary degree, or contact, distribution (Trapman 2007 and references therein). This restriction is applied for mathematical tractability, but neglects certain realistic network properties such as loops and clustering; we return to this issue in \u00a74.3. We refer to the individual(s) initially infected by a source outside the population as \u2018generation 0\u2019 infectives. All individuals infected by a generation n infective (n = 0, 1, \u2026) are considered generation n + 1 infectives, and \u2018later-generation\u2019 infectives (i.e. generation \u2265 1) receive their infections from other individuals within the population.\n\nFollowing the derivation presented by Brauer (2008), we suppose that each node has a degree distribution {pd}, described by the probability generating function (PGF)\n\nFurthermore, if we randomly choose an edge and follow it to a node, the excess degree of that node (number of other edges emanating out) has distribution {p\u0303d} given by the PGF\n\nwhere \u2329d\u232a = g\u2032(1) denotes the expected value of degree d.\n\nAn infective is assumed to transmit infection to each still-susceptible contact independently with probability T, called the transmissibility, taken to be a constant. That is, if d is the number of still-susceptible contacts, then the number of infections transmitted is distributed as Binomial(d, T). For the initial infective, who has been infected by a source outside the population, all contacts (given by the degree) remain susceptible. Thus, the PGF \u03b3(s) for the number of infections transmitted by a randomly chosen initial infective is (Brauer 2008)\n\nA later-generation infective has received the infection from one of its contacts, i.e. it has been arrived at by following a randomly chosen edge from another node. Hence, the number of still-susceptible contacts is determined from the excess degree distribution. (We implicitly assume that an individual can only be infected once, as in an SI- or SIR-type disease.) Thus, the PGF \u0393(s) for the number of infections transmitted by a later-generation infective is\n\nThe basic reproductive number, R0, can then be defined as the mean number of infections transmitted by one typical (later-generation) infective:\n\nIn this way, we can see how the disease's reproductive number in the network-based approach is composed of the underlying processes of host\u2013host contact (represented by G\u2032(1)) and pathogen transmission (represented by T). R0 is an appropriate measure of the fitness of a single strain of pathogen.\n\nThe phenomenological approach (e.g. Antia et al. 2003; Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005; Day et al. 2006; Yates et al. 2006; Reluga et al. 2007) does not build up the process of disease spread from a description of host contacts and pathogen transmission. Rather, it directly specifies a distribution of number of new infections, X, produced by an infected individual. The approach typically uses a Poisson distribution of infections, implicitly assuming homogeneous mixing in the population, but sometimes incorporates individual heterogeneity by allowing the mean of the distribution itself to be a random variable. For example, Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005) generally draw the mean, \u03bd, from a Gamma distribution with mean R0 and dispersion parameter \u03b2; then X has a negative binomial distribution with mean R0 and dispersion \u03b2. As special cases, \u03b2 = 1 corresponds to \u03bd \u223c Exp(R0) and X \u223c Geometric(R0), while \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e corresponds to \u03bd = R0 (no individual variation) and X \u223c Poisson(R0). In any case, the key difference from the network-based approach is that \u0393(s) is effectively specified directly. As before, one then defines the basic reproductive number as R0 = \u0393\u2032(1). Notice, however, that unlike the network-based approach, no distinction is made here between generation 0 infectives (i.e. those who receive the infection from an outside source) and later-generation infectives. (In special cases of the network model, all generations are in fact equivalent; see appendix A.2.) If we consider only later-generation infectives, the phenomenological approach can be obtained via the network-based approach, provided that the contact distribution in the latter is chosen to obtain the same end result for the offspring distribution (appendix A.3).\n\nFor example, if the contact distribution is such that the number of still-susceptible contacts has a negative binomial distribution with mean \u03bb and dispersion \u03b2 (appendix A.1), i.e. G(z) = (1 + (\u03bb/\u03b2)(1 \u2212 z))\u2212\u03b2 (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005), then the offspring distribution will also be negative binomial with mean \u03bbT and dispersion \u03b2: \u0393(s) = G(1 \u2212 T + Ts) = (1 + (\u03bbT/\u03b2) (1 \u2212 s))\u2212\u03b2. Since R0 = \u03bbT, this gives exact correspondence with the phenomenological approach of Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005) described above. Other examples of contact distributions and the resulting offspring distributions are described in appendix B.1 and illustrated in figure 1.\n\nRegardless of which approach is used to obtain the offspring distribution, the extinction probability\nq of the process\u2014that is, the probability that the disease outbreak eventually ends, infecting only a finite number of people\u2014is the smallest non-negative solution of the equation \u0393(s) = s. The epidemic is guaranteed to go extinct if R0 \u2264 1, but persists with non-zero probability if R0 > 1 (Allen 2003). Recall, however, that the network-based approach also distinguishes the generation 0 infective from all others, and if this initial infective is chosen uniformly at random, then the overall extinction probability in that approach is g(1 \u2212 T + Tq) \u2261 \u03b3(q) (Brauer 2008).\n\nA phenomenological approach has also been used to explore how pathogen evolution affects disease emergence by accounting for multiple pathogen strains (Antia et al. 2003; Andr\u00e9 & Day 2005; Day et al. 2006; Yates et al. 2006; Reluga et al. 2007). These models typically assume a Poisson distribution of infectious contacts, which, interestingly, has been found usually to be a poor fit to epidemiological data (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005). Mathematically similar models have also been used to model evolution and \u2018escape\u2019 in a population of replicating individuals (Iwasa et al.\n2003, 2004; Serra & Haccou 2007). In the most general of these, Serra & Haccou (2007) outline the model for an arbitrary offspring distribution as well as arbitrary mutation scheme and fitness landscape. However, to date, such generalizations and their implications have not been explored in the context of evolutionary epidemiology, nor have underlying mechanisms contributing to the offspring distribution been considered separately. One can readily extend the network-based framework outlined in \u00a72.1 to investigate these questions.\n\nWe account for pathogen evolution using a multi-type branching process. An individual's type i (i = 1, \u2026 , m) denotes which one of the m possible pathogen strains is infecting that host. We allow for arbitrary contact distribution and assume that the contact network is determined by the host, independently of the pathogen strain. Thus, as before, degree is described by the PGF g(z) and the excess degree by G(z) for every individual, regardless of type. We retain the assumption that transmissions occur independently to each contact, and further assume that transmissibility T is strain-specific, denoted Ti for strain i. Thus, the probability of making an infectious contact depends only on the current infective's strain type. However, a different strain may be transmitted as a result of pathogen mutation. Specifically, given that a type i infective makes an infectious contact, strain j is transmitted with probability \u03bcij (\u2211j\n\u03bcij = 1, ). We call the m \u00d7 m matrix U = [\u03bcij] the \u2018mutation matrix\u2019, representing the mutational pathway(s) allowed in the evolution of the pathogen and their probabilities.\n\nWe use the word \u2018mutation\u2019 loosely to mean any processes resulting in a change in the strain identified as a host's type. These processes actually occur within individual hosts, but we account for this in a phenomenological way. The most accurate interpretation of our approach would be that a host currently infected with strain i transmits only strain i, but that each infective produced in the next generation has probability \u03bcij of converting to strain j over the course of infection, before any further transmission occurs. In this approach, \u03bcij is an \u2018effective conversion rate\u2019 from strain i to strain j within one host, summarizing the results of within-host dynamics (\u00a74.3). This is a common type of simplification involving a separation of the time scales on which within- and between-host processes occur. Antia et al. (2003) mention the possibility of strain conversion owing to mutation within a host, and Andr\u00e9 & Day (2005) explicitly model this in a phenomenological way; however, neither discuss the above considerations in any detail.\n\nReturning to our multi-type process, the number of transmissions of each type made by a type i infective with d susceptible contacts now has distribution Multinomial(d; 1\u2212 Ti, TiUi\u00b7), where Ui\u00b7 is the ith row of U and the probability vector is given in the order: no transmission, transmit strain 1, \u2026 , transmit strain m. The corresponding PGF for the number of transmitted infections of each type, (X1 , \u2026 , Xm), given d susceptible contacts, is\n\nThus, extending the notation of \u00a72.1, the PGF for number of infections transmitted by an initial infective of type i is\n\nand for a later generation infective, the PGF is\n\nDerivations of these PGFs appear in appendix C.\n\nThe probability of extinction starting from one later-generation infective of type i, denoted qi, is obtained as the smallest non-negative root of the equation qi = \u0393i(q1, \u2026 , qm), solved simultaneously for all i (appendix D). More compactly, we can write this as a vector fixed-point equation: , where  and . Starting from a generation 0 infective of type i, chosen uniformly at random, the overall probability of extinction is then given by g(1 \u2212 Ti + Ti \u2211 j=1m\n\u03bcijqj) \u2261 \u03b3i (appendix C). If we account for strain conversion as per the above interpretation, the only adjustment we must make in our calculations, assuming that strain i is introduced to a randomly chosen individual, is to allow the initial infective to be type j with probability \u03bcij. We generally assume that strain 1 is, by definition, initially introduced to the host population.\n\nIn what follows, it is sometimes useful to refer to the \u2018basic reproductive number of strain i\u2019, denoted R0,i and defined as the expected total number of infectious contacts made by a typical (later-generation) type i infective. Since this number is distributed as Binomial(d, Ti), we have\n\nIf strain i were the only strain present, with no possibility of mutation, R0,i would be the value of its basic reproductive number in the single-strain model.\n\nWe define emergence as the situation in which the pathogen escapes extinction, which necessarily requires evolution to a strain having R0,i > 1. Probability of emergence is thus the complement of probability of extinction. We present numerical results for the probability of emergence beginning from one later-generation infective of type 1, 1 \u2212 q1, but these results may be extended to account for generation 0 and/or type conversion as described above. Note that the branching process may be either indecomposable or decomposable, depending on the mutational scheme. Thus, if the epidemic persists, the complement of strains that will be present must be treated on a case-by-case basis (appendix D).\n\nOur derivation so far is quite general, imposing no a priori restrictions on the choices of contact distribution, transmissibilities and mutation probabilities. However, in the numerical results to follow, we limit ourselves to specific examples.\n\nContact distributions. We consider the following contact distributions, each with mean \u03bb (see also appendix B.1).\n\u2014 Deterministic. Every individual has exactly \u03bb contacts.\u2014 Mixed deterministic. There are n types of individuals, where the kth type occurs in proportion pk and has exactly \u03bbk contacts.\u2014 Poisson.\u2014 Mixed Poisson. There are n types of individuals, where the kth type occurs in proportion pk and has a Poisson(\u03bbk) distribution of contacts.\u2014 Negative binomial, with dispersion \u03b2.\n\nMutational schemes. We consider two broad types of mutational schemes: \u2018linear\u2019 and \u2018hub-and-spoke\u2019 (see also appendix B.2). In all cases, we assume that strain m is well adapted to the host; that is, Tm is chosen such that R0,m > 1. On the other hand, any other strain i is poorly adapted to the host (R0,i < 1) unless otherwise specified.\n\nLinear mutational schemes represent single directions through strain space, where strains 2, \u2026 , m \u2212 1 are intermediates between strains 1 and m. We consider the following possibilities.\n\u2014 One-step irreversible. The pathogen must acquire m \u2212 1 point mutations, one at a time and in a fixed order. Thus, mutation occurs only from strain i to i + 1. This scheme is presented by Antia et al. (2003).\u2014 Multi-step irreversible. Again the pathogen must acquire m \u2212 1 point mutations in a fixed order, but now possibly simultaneously, implying that mutations can occur from strain i to any strain j > i, though with diminishing probabilities. Essentially, higher order terms are being included where they were neglected in the previous scheme. This scheme is presented by Gokhale et al. (2009), along with biological examples.\u2014 Interchangeable and irreversible. This scheme, also presented by Gokhale et al. (2009), is similar to the preceding one, but allows the point mutations to be acquired in arbitrary order, introducing a combinatorial aspect to the probabilities. Thus, there are multiple evolutionary pathways between the first and last strains, with strain i in our model representing any \u2018real\u2019 strain having i \u2212 1 of the required mutations. Our model thus implicitly assumes that any collection of i \u2212 1 mutations yields the same transmissibility, Ti.\u2014 Point mutation and recombination. One-step point mutation occurs as in scheme 1, but we simplistically model an additional mechanism of more extensive genetic change (perhaps recombination or reassortment; Kuiken et al. 2006) by allowing any strain i to adapt directly to strain m with a probability not tied to that of point mutation. We neglect the chance of simultaneous mutational events, and all are irreversible.\u2014 One-step reversible. In a modification of scheme 1, mutation can occur from strain i to either i + 1 or i \u2212 1, representing both forward and reverse point mutation (again neglecting the chance of simultaneous mutations).One-step irreversible mutations, coupled with a Poisson(\u03bb) distribution of contacts, corresponds to the model of Antia et al. (2003), where R0,i = \u03bbTi.\n\nHub-and-spoke mutational schemes represent multiple distinct pathways through strain space. After strain 1 is introduced, mutation may proceed from this \u2018hub\u2019 along a number of different \u2018spokes\u2019 (directions in strain space). Though still numbered sequentially for convenience, strains 2, \u2026 , m \u2212 1 no longer represent intermediates on the path to strain m. For simplicity, in our results we consider only paths of length 1 (i.e. strains 2, \u2026 , m represent m \u2212 1 distinct pathways), with equal probability of proceeding along any path. However, this set-up could obviously be extended to incorporate pathways of various lengths and mutation probabilities. We consider two possible scenarios.\n\u2014 One-step irreversible.\u2014 One-step reversible.Finally, we must specify the transmissibility of each strain, , particularly how these values relate to one another. For a given contact distribution, defining  effectively determines the pathogen's fitness landscape. For linear mutation schemes, we will typically use the \u2018jackpot model\u2019 (Antia et al. 2003), in which strains 1 through m \u2212 1 have identical transmissibility, and hence the same value of R0,i < 1. Other biologically interesting possibilities include a fitness valley, where intermediate strains have lower fitness than strain 1, or an additive model, where fitness increases linearly with strain number (Antia et al. 2003). For hub-and-spoke schemes, we take T2 , \u2026 , Tm\u22121 less than T1, representing deleterious mutations, while only Tm is greater than T1, representing a beneficial mutation.\n\nThe basic reproductive number, R0, is widely used as a predictor of when a disease has epidemic potential, as well as a descriptor of disease spread (Anderson & May 1991; Allen 2003; Brauer 2008). In branching process models, the disease has a positive probability of emergence if, and only if, R0 > 1. Other aspects of the offspring distribution affect the probability of emergence as well, and thus it is common to compare the probability of emergence across different distributions at the same value of R0 (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005; Brauer 2008).\n\nAs clearly illustrated in the network-based approach, however, R0 is a composite quantity that is influenced by the combined processes of host-to-host contacts and disease transmission (Meyers et al. 2005; Brauer 2008). Once we decompose the process of disease spread into these mechanistic components, other comparisons suggest themselves. In particular, given that R0 itself is a critical threshold quantity for disease spread, it is natural to ask how this quantity changes across different contact distributions that have the same mean number of contacts and the same disease transmissibility. We might also ask how probability of emergence changes as a function of T rather than R0. Meyers et al. (2005) likewise argue for a focus on transmissibility, rather than R0, from the perspective of making reliable public health predictions across different host subpopulations.\n\nInsight into the comparison between contact distributions can be gained by rewriting the equation R0 = G\u2032(1)T. Using the relationship G(z) = g\u2032(z)/g\u2032(1) gives R0 = (g\u2033(1)/g\u2032(1))T. Then substituting g\u2033(1) = \u03c32 \u2212 g\u2032(1) + (g\u2032(1))2, where \u03c32 is the variance of the contact distribution, yields\n\nwhere c = \u03c3/g\u2032(1) is the coefficient of variation of the contact distribution. For a given transmissibility and mean number of contacts, the contact distribution that maximizes variance thus maximizes R0. The above equation is essentially the same as the expression for R0 given by Meyers et al. (2005), although there it is not rewritten in terms of c, and is similar to the expression for R0 used in deterministic network models (May & Lloyd 2001).\n\nAnalogously for a multi-type process, the expectation or mean matrix M = [aij], where  is the expected number of type j progeny of one type i individual, is crucial in determining criticality of the process (Harris 1963; Allen 2003; Haccou et al. 2005). If the dominant eigenvalue of M is less than or equal to one, extinction is certain; otherwise, there is a positive probability of non-extinction and the process is classified as \u2018supercritical\u2019 (Harris 1963; Haccou et al. 2005). This threshold result holds whether the process is indecomposable or decomposable (see appendix D). The dominant eigenvalue of M is also known as the population-wide basic reproductive number.\n\nIn our multiple strain model, with contact distribution given by PGF g(z) and mutation probabilities given by matrix U = [\u03bcij], we have aij = G\u2032(1)Ti\n\u03bcij = (g\u2032(1)(1 + c2) \u2212 1)Ti\u03bcij. We can thus express the mean matrix as\n\nemphasizing the dependence of M\u2014and hence its dominant eigenvalue\u2014on the mean and variance of the contact distribution, the transmissibility of each strain and the mutation scheme.\n\nFigure 2 illustrates, for a single strain, the impact of contact distribution on the basic reproductive number, R0, and on the probability of emergence starting from one later-generation infective, 1 \u2212 q. Figure 2a shows how R0 increases with transmissibility T: in all cases, this increase is linear, but at a different rate for each contact distribution depending on the variance in contacts. Figure 2b plots the probability of emergence versus T for each contact distribution. This probability becomes non-zero at the point where R0 passes the critical value of one, which occurs at a different value of T for each distribution (as illustrated in figure 2a). Thus, at low values of T, the disease can persist in some host contact structures but not others, despite the fact that they all have the same mean number of contacts. As T increases, however, the probability of emergence increases at different rates for different contact structures, such that the ordering is not preserved. This observation is highlighted in the inset, showing emergence probability over an extended range of T. In contrast, the ordering is consistent in figure 2c, which plots the probability of emergence versus R0, comparable to Brauer's presentation (Brauer 2008). The same value of R0 has been achieved for each contact distribution by varying T to compensate. We can think of the middle plot as showing the net result of opposing influences illustrated in figure 2a,c. Similar considerations and results on the impact of contact distribution and transmissibility apply to the multiple strain case.\n\nWhen there are multiple strains of pathogen, the pathways of mutation among them may also affect the threshold parameter. In the case of irreversible mutation, we can number strains such that M is a triangular matrix, with its eigenvalues given simply by the entries on the main diagonal. Assuming the final strain is the best adapted, the dominant eigenvalue is then R0,m = G\u2032(1)Tm. Hence, criticality is independent of the precise details of a uni-directional mutation scheme. By contrast, a scheme that allows both forward and reverse mutation can affect criticality. Figure 3 illustrates how the population R0 (dominant eigenvalue of M) changes with the probability of reverse mutation (\u03bd) in the linear one-step reversible scheme; similar considerations apply to the hub-and-spoke one-step reversible scheme as well. A high rate of reverse mutation from a well-adapted to a poorly adapted strain can tip the branching process from supercritical to subcritical. Population R0 increases almost linearly with Tm, but is relatively insensitive to number of strains (m), earlier strain transmissibility (T1) and forward mutation probability (\u03bc). This is because population R0 is very close to amm = G\u2032(1)Tm(1 \u2212 \u03bd), but slightly influenced by contributions from small populations of other (poorly adapted) strains that persist asymptotically if the process escapes extinction.\n\nWe can compare not only the qualitative result of criticality, but also the quantitative probability of emergence across various supercritical branching processes. To obtain this probability, 1 \u2212 q1, we compute the extinction probability  numerically, through fixed-point iterations of the offspring distribution PGF,  (\u00a72.2). We initiate an iteration from a point  with si < 1, , to ensure convergence to the appropriate fixed point (see appendix D for details), and continue until the difference between successive iterations, in max norm, is less than a specified tolerance, taken to be 10\u221212 or 10\u221216 in the figures we present.\n\nFigure 4 illustrates the probability of emergence across various linear mutation schemes with the same contact distribution. Here, Tm is far from the critical threshold, and reverse mutation, even at a high rate equal to that of forward mutation, makes a negligible impact on the probability of emergence. This agrees with Sagitov and Serra's result that reverse mutation is negligible in a similar model with an arbitrary offspring distribution (Sagitov & Serra 2009), and with the neglect of pathways to the escape mutant exceeding the minimum length in the work of Iwasa et al. (2003, 2004). On the other hand, results are highly sensitive to the path of forward mutation that is assumed to be possible. Allowing jumps directly to strain m tends to make a particularly large difference, with this effect most pronounced when early strains have very low transmissibility. Simultaneous point mutations, though extremely rare, also make a significant contribution to the probability of emergence. In general, similar trends were observed for larger Tm, with the probability of emergence scaled up but the relationships among mutation schemes the same. Probability of emergence reaches a plateau, presumably at the probability of the well-adapted strain m ever appearing, as Tm becomes very large (results not shown).\n\nWe can also consider the impact of mutation scheme when intermediate strain fitness (as determined by transmissibility for fixed contact structure) varies. Although we have typically used the jackpot model, one might also consider other choices of transmissibilities. As one would expect, the higher the intermediate strain fitness, the higher the probability of emergence as observed by Antia et al. (2003). Now that we have generalized the mutation scheme, we can investigate whether this effect is more pronounced for some schemes than for others. For instance, a decrease in intermediate strain transmissibility (creating a fitness valley) hurts the pathogen's chance of emergence more if only one-step forward mutation is possible, as opposed to a jump directly to the final strain through recombination (results not shown). This is in agreement with an observation by Iwasa et al. (2004).\n\nFor any given mutation scheme, we can gain greater insight into the effect of mutation probabilities and number of strains by estimating the probability of emergence analytically. As other authors (Antia et al. 2003; Iwasa et al.\n2003, 2004; Serra & Haccou 2007; Sagitov & Serra 2009) have considered analytical approximations for this model (or special cases of it) in detail, we keep our remarks brief.\n\nUsing an intuitive argument, Antia et al. derived the following approximation for the probability of evolution to strain m (starting from strain 1) in the case of a Poisson-distributed number of infectious transmissions and one-step irreversible mutation (Antia et al. 2003):\n\nThis approximation, which holds for \u03bc \u226a 1 and R0,i not too close to 1, makes it clear that probability of emergence, which is proportional to the probability of evolution in this estimation, is expected to scale \u223c\u03bcm\u22121 (Antia et al. 2003). The derivation in fact proceeds without reference to any features of the offspring distribution besides its mean, and figure 5 confirms that the prediction holds for all our sample contact distributions. Differences among contact distributions are primarily due to our comparison at fixed Ti rather than fixed R0,i.\n\nMore generally, Serra & Haccou (2007) give a formal derivation for probability of \u2018escape\u2019 (or emergence), showing that (in our notation)\n\nunder quite general conditions, including the scenarios considered by Antia et al. (2003) and Iwasa et al. (2003, 2004). Specifically, this approximation is valid under the following assumptions.\n\u2014 Total offspring distribution for each type is arbitrary, provided its variance is finite. The mean of the distribution for type i is R0,i. Mutations occur independently among the offspring.\u2014 There is a single \u2018escape\u2019 type (which we denote m) having R0,m > 1; all other types i \u2260 m have R0,i < 1.\u2014 There are no mutations away from the escape type; thus, qm can be computed independently and substituted into the above approximation for qi, i \u2260 m. However, all other mutations among types are allowed.\u2014 All mutation probabilities \u03bcij, i \u2260 j, are of O(u).Under these conditions, the above approximation has error of O(u2). However, the neglected error term increases as R0,i \u2192 1, implying that the approximation will break down if strain fitness approaches the critical threshold. Iwasa et al. (2004) present approximations valid for various choices of R0,i, including the near-critical case, though only for a specific offspring distribution.\n\nAs an example, consider our \u2018mutation and recombination\u2019 scheme. Either by applying an Antia-like argument to this specific scenario or by substituting mutation probabilities into Serra and Haccou's result, we can show that the probability of emergence starting from a type 1 individual (1 \u2212 q1) scales as O(\u03bcm\u22121) + O(\u03c1), where \u03bc is the probability of one-step forward \u2018point mutation\u2019 and \u03c1 is the probability of jump-to-m \u2018recombination\u2019. Figure 6 supports this prediction for an example with m = 3 strains, illustrating the relative contributions of the different adaptive pathways. When \u03c1 \u226b \u03bc2, the probability of emergence is almost constant in \u03bc and scales approximately linearly in \u03c1. When \u03c1 \u226a \u03bc2, the probability of emergence is almost constant in \u03c1 and scales proportionally to \u03bc2.\n\nDespite the availability of these useful analytical results, there is still a place for numerical solutions when looking for subtle differences among cases (e.g. different contact distributions) or where the assumptions underlying these approximations are broken or pushed to their limits (e.g. relatively large mutation probabilities), as we will encounter in the next subsection.\n\nThe same biological mechanisms (e.g. nucleotide substitution rate, error-correcting mechanisms) contribute to all mutation rates, not only those for beneficial mutations. Given this constraint, it is not immediately clear whether pathogens with the highest mutation rates will have the largest or smallest probability of emergence. We explore this question for two mutational schemes in which deleterious steps are possible: one-step reversible mutation and hub-and-spoke irreversible mutation.\n\nFor simplicity, with one-step reversible mutation, we use only two strains (implying that linear and hub-and-spoke schemes are equivalent), the poorly adapted strain 1 and the well-adapted strain 2. Mutation from 1 to 2 occurs with probability \u03bc, and from 2 to 1 with probability \u03bd, which we scale proportionally to \u03bc. Results demonstrate a non-monotonic relationship between mutation rate and probability of emergence (figure 7). The probability of emergence increases with mutation rate over a wide range, before abruptly crashing to zero. This occurs because the branching process becomes subcritical once reverse mutation rate is too high, even when forward mutation rate is similarly high (\u00a73.3). Note, however, that the crash does not occur if T2 is well above the critical threshold.\n\nWith an irreversible hub-and-spoke mutation scheme, we assume that the initial strain is equally likely to mutate to any other, but only one mutational pathway is beneficial. As an extreme case, we set transmissibility of all deleterious strains to be zero. Figure 8 plots the probability of emergence versus T1 for various mutation probabilities. When T1 is well below the critical threshold (at which R0,1 reaches 1), emergence probability increases linearly with mutation probability, as we would predict from analytical approximations (\u00a73.5). Although this figure plots results for m = 10 strains, a virtually identical increase in emergence probability versus \u03bc at fixed small T1 was observed for m = 2, 3, 5 as well (results not shown). This indicates that regardless of how high the risk of deleterious steps, a pathogen that is guaranteed to go extinct unless it acquires a beneficial mutation (evolves to strain m) is always better off having a large mutation rate. Near the critical threshold, emergence probability shows a sharp jump; once strain 1 is sufficiently fit to escape extinction without further evolution, mutation probability makes only a small difference in results. Shortly after this point, a very high mutation probability becomes detrimental to the pathogen, even while strain 1 is not as well adapted as strain m. The risk of mutating to a poorly adapted strain now outweighs the potential benefit of mutating to a better adapted strain. Adding reverse mutation at a probability equal to that of forward mutation makes negligible difference to quantitative results (results not shown), as also observed with linear mutation schemes where R0,m is not too close to one. We might suspect that increasing reverse mutation probability independently of forward mutation probability could provide a benefit to the pathogen if the transmissibility of deleterious strains is non-zero, such that mutation could \u2018rescue\u2019 the pathogen by a return to strain 1 (the hub). However, this does not appear to be the case within tested parameter ranges (results not shown): increasing reverse mutation probability decreases probability of emergence, though only marginally when R0,m is well above one.\n\nThe contact distribution associated with highest risk of emergence is not always the same, but rather depends on the transmissibility, i.e. the particular pathogen involved. Especially large differences among contact distributions occur near the critical threshold for the branching process. Recall figure 2b: at a transmissibility of 0.03, probability of emergence ranges from 0 to approximately 0.7, depending on contact distribution, even when all distributions have the same mean. This suggests that certain pathogens, having a transmissibility near the critical threshold, will be able to cause an epidemic in some host populations, but not others.\n\nAlthough previous authors have often found that increased population heterogeneity increases the probability of extinction (e.g. Caraco et al. 1998; Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005), in phenomenological models this heterogeneity is necessarily introduced directly to the offspring distribution. In contrast, the heterogeneity we introduce through contacts in our more mechanistic model has the counteracting effect of raising R0, as the chance of getting the disease is correlated with the number of opportunities to pass it on. (Recall the distinction between degree and excess degree distribution.) Through comparison of contact distributions at given transmissibility, we found that heterogeneity can in fact increase the risk of emergence over a significant range.\n\nProbability of emergence is highly sensitive to the mutational pathway(s) by which the pathogen may possibly evolve (figure 4). Provided we are not too close to the critical threshold, reverse mutation has very limited impact on this probability and may reasonably be neglected. On the other hand, the possibility of taking large adaptive steps through either simultaneous point mutations or another mechanism of genetic change can have a dramatic impact. Given the finding on simultaneous mutations, it may be worth including higher order terms in other mutation schemes as well. As in the case of contact distribution, however, the \u2018most risky\u2019 mutational pathway depends on the pathogen's initial transmissibility. Given a mutational scheme, probability of emergence is also sensitive to mutation probabilities and number of intermediate strains in an analytically predictable manner (figures 5 and 6).\n\nWe also considered more realistic situations where deleterious as well as beneficial evolutionary steps are available to the pathogen, either by reverse mutation or by including multiple pathways in strain space. Here, we constrained all types of mutations to occur with proportional probabilities, based on some overall mutation rate of the pathogen. We found that, when the pathogen was initially poorly adapted, increasing overall mutation rate was usually beneficial to an emerging pathogen (i.e. riskier to the host). On the other hand, as the pathogen's initial fitness increases beyond the critical threshold where survival without adaptation is possible, the risk of deleterious mutations comes to outweigh the benefit of potential mutation to a more fit strain, and a high mutation rate becomes a liability (figure 8). Thus, our results largely provide support for the hypothesis that the statistically higher propensity of RNA viruses to emerge is due to their high mutation rate (Cleaveland et al. 2001; Woolhouse et al. 2005). However, an exception occurs with pathogens for which the fully adapted strain has a basic reproductive number only slightly above one. In this situation, when allowing for reverse mutation, we observed another phenomenon in which emergence probability has a non-monotonic relationship with overall mutation rate (figure 7). If this rate passes a critical point, excessive back mutation to poorly adapted strains implies that the pathogen can no longer sustain itself. This result parallels the phenomenon of \u2018error catastrophe\u2019 observed in viral quasi-species models, which offer a theoretical explanation for experimental success in inducing lethal mutagenesis in viruses (Eigen 2002; Anderson et al. 2004; Clementi 2008). Although the required \u2018mutation\u2019 rate may at first appear unrealistically high, it is important to remember that it does not represent the probability of point mutation during a single replication event, but actually incorporates all factors involved in strain conversion, including genetic changes arising during multiple rounds of replication and within-host strain competition. Taken together, our results suggest that any attempt to alter a pathogen's mutation rate for host benefit should be undertaken with careful consideration of the pathogen's initial fitness and the availability of mutations, both beneficial and deleterious. An attempt to induce lethal mutagenesis seems liable to backfire if the pathogen has significant adaptive potential, as in the case of many emerging pathogens.\n\nWe have modelled the spread of an emerging pathogen following its introduction to a new host species. This model does not incorporate the dynamics of the introduction itself (or possibly multiple introductions), such as interspecific interactions (Woolhouse et al. 2005; Day et al. 2006; Kuiken et al. 2006; Woolhouse & Gaunt 2007; Lloyd-Smith et al. 2009). Indeed, although a better understanding of the dynamics of cross-species transmission is likely to be important in dealing with emerging diseases, few models to date have considered multiple species and phases in cross-over (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2009). (However, see Day et al. (2006) and Reluga et al. (2007) for models incorporating ongoing interactions with animal reservoirs.) Putting our model in a broader context could elucidate the impact of additional risk factors such as pathogen\u2013host range (Cleaveland et al. 2001; Taylor et al. 2001).\n\nWithin the context of transmission in a single-host population, there are several common but potentially significant limitations of our modelling approach. Given the importance of contact structure that we and others have predicted, consideration of more realistic networks may be an important next step. Using a branching process neglects higher order network features, such as loops that persist even in large populations, thus implicitly assuming that the availability of susceptibles is not limited by local saturation. Clustering of contacts is expected to limit disease spread owing to reduction in the availability of susceptibles (Keeling & Eames 2005), and including features such as triangles in networks may have a dramatic impact in decreasing the probability of a large-scale epidemic (Trapman 2007). Thus, we expect the branching process approach to provide an upper bound on the risk of emergence. On the other hand, a recent analysis addressing some apparent inconsistencies in the literature suggests that the impact of clustering on the probability of an epidemic is in fact negligible unless degree is typically small or host-based heterogeneities are large (Miller 2009), providing some support for conclusions drawn from a branching process approach. While some authors (e.g. Ball & Neal 2002; Trapman 2007; Miller 2009) have made progress in modelling stochastic single-strain disease spread with more complicated contact structures, to our knowledge such approaches have not yet been extended to multiple strains.\n\nA second major assumption in our model is that hosts are homogeneous in terms of their epidemiological characteristics. That is, the same transmissibility applies to every host infected with a given strain of pathogen. However, host-based factors are predicted to play a role in emergence risk (Woolhouse et al. 2005; Woolhouse & Gaunt 2007), suggesting value in a more realistic model. This would incorporate variability in host characteristics contributing to transmissibility, such as infectivity and susceptibility (Yates et al. 2006; Miller 2007). Analysis in the single-strain case predicts that such heterogeneities reduce the probability of an epidemic (Miller 2007, 2009).\n\nFurthermore, both the level of transmissibility (T) and the strain conversion process have been treated only phenomenologically in our present between-host model. We (and other authors) have implicitly assumed that any conversion of strains within an individual is instantaneous, with no possibility for co-infection. We have also ignored variation in the precise number of pathogen copies in the body. Realistically, once a mutation arises in a host there will be some dynamical process leading to fixation or loss over time, with coexistence of strains at least temporarily. Both Andr\u00e9 & Day (2005) and Handel et al. (2006) also raise this issue, the latter suggesting that the difficulty of obtaining direct estimates of parameters in the between-host model (e.g. R0 and conversion rates) supports a move to modelling at the within-host level.\n\nAn important avenue for future work will thus be to develop an explicit model of within-host processes, and then to link the within- and between-host scales. In recent years, a number of authors have developed such \u2018nested models\u2019 (reviewed in Mideo et al. 2008); however, these are typically deterministic, whereas we suggest that stochasticity may be important at both levels. A pathogen may then increase its fitness via multiple routes (Antolin 2008), with potential for conflicting selection at different scales (Gilchrist & Coombs 2006; Coombs et al. 2007). We anticipate that antagonistic selection at the within- versus between-host scales would tend to reduce the probability of population-level emergence, as the more transmissible strain (better able to avoid extinction between hosts) is thwarted by dominance of other strain(s) within the host. By extending our model to the within-host scale, we can address these sorts of trade-offs in greater detail, offering further perspectives on risk factors contributing to evolutionary emergence."}
