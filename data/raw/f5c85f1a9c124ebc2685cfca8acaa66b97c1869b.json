{"title": "", "body": "The following facts and figures have been obtained from experimental infections and observations from field cases. 5, [9] [10] [11] They summarise and reflect the current state of knowledge, and will have to be revised and expanded as additional information becomes available: \u271c Cats can be infected via the intratracheal and oral routes (eg, by eating infected chickens); \u271c Infection can occur upon contact with infected birds (Fig 2) \n\nBefore the veterinary practitioner expresses a suspicion, the potential risk must be evaluated according to the case history and circumstances (see box on page 617). If these conditions are fulfilled, a risk is assumed when a clinical assessment reveals fever, lethargy/depression, dyspnoea, conjunctivitis; neurological signs may also be seen. Rapid progression and death are important indicators.\n\nTo date, no human case has been linked to exposure to a diseased cat. The differential diagnosis should exclude other infections leading to similar systemic and respiratory signs, such as those caused by feline herpesvirus, calicivirus, coronavirus (feline infectious peritonitis), bacteria (Bordetella bronchiseptica, Chlamydophila felis) or Mycoplasma species.\n\nFinally, remember that clinical signs can only result in a clinical suspicion, which must be confirmed by laboratory testing.\n\nThe authorities should be notified according to the national regulations, and an appropriate diagnostic laboratory contacted for detailed instructions. However, some general rules apply when collecting oropharyngeal, nasal and rectal swabs or faecal samples: \u271c Label plastic sample tubes using an alcohol-proof ink marker; \u271c Transfer the samples to the tubes, and close tightly; \u271c Wipe the outside of the tubes with alcohol to reduce the risk of infection to laboratory staff; \u271c Ship the sample tube safely enclosed in plastic bags to the national reference laboratory.\n\nPost-mortem samples of lung and mediastinal lymph nodes should be obtained and shipped in 10% formol saline. (Note that the handling of potential H5N1 post-mortem samples is forbidden in some countries.)\n\nThe use of in-house influenza detection tests is discouraged.\n\nFor personal protection \u271c Minimise all physical contact with the cat, to avoid scratching and biting; \u271c Avoid contact with saliva, respiratory secretions, faeces and urine; \u271c Wear gloves, a mask and protective eyewear when handling the cat; \u271c Sedation of the cat is recommended before collecting samples; \u271c Use a standard medical disinfectant for surface decontamination.\n\n\u271c The suspected cat should be kept in isolation in a cage at the veterinary clinic.\n\n\u271c At the owner's house, the cat should be confined to a separate room prior to presentation at the practice; \u271c Physical contact with the cat should be minimised, and scratching and biting avoided; \u271c Litter trays, bowls, baskets and other potentially contaminated objects should be disinfected using a hypochlorite solution (household bleach); \u271c Rooms to which the cat had access before the visit to the veterinary clinic should be thoroughly cleaned using a household detergent.\n\nIf H5N1 virus infection is suspected, minimise all physical contact with the cat, avoid scratching and biting, and wear gloves, a mask and protective eyewear when handling the cat.\n\nIf the cat lives in a region where H5N1 virus-infected birds have been identified by laboratory tests, the following must be considered as being risk factors:\n\n\u271c The cat lives in an environment where waterfowl are present; \u271c The cat has access to outdoors; \u271c The cat has contact with free-range or indoor poultry; \u271c The cat has been fed uncooked poultry meat; \u271c The cat has been in close contact with an H5N1 virus-infected cat.\n\nDuring the first 7 days after infection, a sick cat can transmit H5N1 virus to another cat in close contact. The infection is inapparent for a short incubation period, but persistent infections have not been reported in mammals. \n\nWhat can owners do to minimise the risk of H5N1 infection in their cats?\n\n\u271c The development of the epidemiological situation should be followed in the national and local media; \u271c Feeding of uncooked poultry meat to cats should be avoided; \u271c If many deaths occur among wild birds, cats should be kept indoors until further information about the cause is available."}
