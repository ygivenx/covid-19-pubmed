{"title": "Protective efficacy of a novel simian adenovirus vaccine against lethal MERS-CoV challenge in a transgenic human DPP4 mouse model", "body": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) first emerged in Saudi Arabia in mid-20121 and as of March 2017 more than 1917 laboratory-confirmed cases with >650 related deaths had been officially reported to the World Health Organization (WHO). Most infections (>80%) have been geographically linked to Saudi Arabia, but travel-related cases have occurred in Europe, Asia and Africa.1 Dromedary camels are susceptible to MERS-CoV infections and appear to be the main reservoir of virus. However, human-to-human transmission underlies rapid spread of MERS-CoV within hospital settings.2 High seroprevalence of antibodies against MERS-CoV has been reported in dromedary camels in the Middle East and various countries in Africa indicating widespread MERS-CoV circulation.3\n\n\nNo licensed vaccines or treatments are currently available for MERS-CoV infections. Ongoing disease control strategies have so far relied on minimising contact with dromedary camels, observing standard infection control measures to limit nosocomial transmission, contact tracing and quarantine. Addressing this unmet need for MERS-CoV interventions has been prioritised by the WHO for urgent action4 and could most rapidly be achieved through a one health approach in which products are co-developed for use in humans (to prevent disease) and camels (to limit virus shedding and block subsequent transmission to humans). Leveraging vaccine technology platforms with an established safety profile in both these target species would allow relatively rapid progression through the product development pipeline.\n\nMany vaccine platforms have been safely evaluated in humans but vaccine research and development for camelid infections is neglected. Among the most promising human vaccine platforms are replication-deficient simian adenovirus vectors (ChAd), which boasts a very good safety and immunogenicity profile in humans as demonstrated in clinical trials against a wide range of indications including malaria, HIV, tuberculosis, influenza, hepatitis C, Ebola and others.5 One ChAd vector, termed ChAdOx1,6 has undergone testing in dromedary camels, showing excellent safety and immunogenicity when encoding Rift Valley Fever viral glycoproteins.7 We recently made a vaccine construct, ChAdOx1 MERS,8 encoding the full-length MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein (GenBank accession number KJ650098.1) targeted by protective neutralising antibodies.9 The spike glycoprotein transgene sequence was inserted in the ChAdOx1 E1 region, included a human tissue plasminogen activator signal sequence in the N-terminus, and its expression was under the control of the human major immediate early cytomegalovirus promoter including intron A. ChAdOx1 MERS was shown to elicit high-titre MERS-CoV neutralising antibodies and a robust CD8+ T cell response against the spike glycoprotein.8 Here, to determine ChAdOx1 MERS vaccine efficacy we utilised a recently developed transgenic lethal BALB/c mouse model (van Doremalen et al., submitted) expressing the human dipeptidyl peptidase (hDPP4) gene in the Rosa26 locus, which renders mice susceptible to MERS-CoV infection.10 Infection with MERS-CoV in the hDPP4 mouse model is uniformly lethal with a dose of 103 TCID50 or higher. MERS-CoV infection is characterised by an initial respiratory phase and a secondary encephalitic phase, similar to what has been described previously.11\n\n\nChAdOx1 MERS vaccination elicited neutralising antibodies with no statistically significant difference detected between immunisation routes (Mann Whitney U test, p = 0.49) (Fig. 1a). No MERS-CoV neutralising antibody response was observed among the ChAdOx1 vaccine encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (ChAdOx1 eGFP) vaccinees.\n\n\nTo evaluate vaccine efficacy animals were challenged intranasally at 28 days post-vaccination with 104 TCID50 of the HCoV-EMC/2012 MERS-CoV strain in a total volume of 25 \u00b5l and observed daily for signs of disease. Euthanasia was indicated at >20% loss of initial body weight. At 3 days post-inoculation (dpi), four animals from each group were euthanized and lungs collected for analyses. The remaining six animals per group were sacrificed 28 dpi, or when they reached the humane endpoint criteria. These group sizes were sufficient to allow detection of 100% efficacy in the ChAdOx1 MERS group compared to controls with 90% power using a two-sample comparison of proportions at an alpha of 5% as determined in Stata\u00ae v12 statistical software. ChAdOx1 eGFP vaccinees developed signs of disease, including loss of body weight, ruffled fur and lethargy (Fig. 1b). Weight loss begun 3 dpi and at 7\u20138 dpi all mice in the ChAdOx1 eGFP groups either succumbed to infection or reached the predefined euthanasia criteria (Fig. 1c). No signs of disease or significant loss of body weight were observed in mice vaccinated with ChAdOx1 MERS (Fig. 1b, c).\n\nThe presence of MERS-CoV RNA in the lungs and brains was analysed by qRT-PCR on mice (n = 4/group) sacrificed at 3 dpi. High viral loads were found in the lower respiratory tract but not the brains of the ChAdOx1 eGFP-vaccinated mice (intranasal 105.32 TCID50 eq/g tissue, 95% confidence interval (CI): 102.28\u2013105.77, intramuscular 104.51 TCID50 eq/g tissue, 95% CI: 103.1\u2013104.96). No viral RNA was detected in any of the ChAdOx1 MERS vaccinated mice (Fig. 1d). Immunohistochemistry staining for MERS-CoV in lung tissue showed abundance of antigen in the ChAdOx1 eGFP-vaccinated mice, but not the ChAdOx1-MERS vaccines (Fig. 2). MERS-CoV replication was only observed in the type I and type II pneumocytes (Fig. 2 inserts) but not in any of the other respiratory cells such as endothelial cells, bronchiolar epithelium or macrophages of the ChAdOx1 eGFP control animals. No MERS-CoV antigen was observed at 3 dpi, in the brains of any of the mice. However, as our emphasis was on assessing vaccine efficacy against the respiratory phase of disease, no brain samples later than the peak of virus replication in the respiratory tract (3 dpi) were collected.\n\n\nTo address whether or not the single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS vaccine truly resulted in sterile immunity, we analysed the pre and post challenge sera with a MERS-CoV nucleoprotein ELISA. Irrespective of the route of immunisation, relatively low levels of IgG antibodies against nucleoprotein were detected (Fig. 1e), indicating that the animals were likely briefly infected during the first 1\u20132 days after inoculation but that this did not result in morbidity and mortality. No significant difference in the MERS-CoV nucleoprotein response was detected between the vaccinated groups (Mann Whitney U test, p = 0.6970; Fig. 1e).\n\nTogether these data provide support for further evaluation of ChAdOx1 MERS vaccine in humans and dromedary camels. This should be relatively straightforward given the established safety profile of the ChAdOx1 platform in humans5 and dromedary camels.7 A deployable human MERS-CoV vaccine will need to be safe and efficacious in at-risk populations, including healthcare workers, camel herders and those with comorbidities as highlighted in the ongoing WHO-led consultation on an ideal target product profile for MERS-CoV vaccines. However, a major gap remains in the understanding of key immune mechanisms responsible for protection from disease; whilst MERS-CoV infections elicit high titre neutralising antibody in camels, these do not appear sufficient to provide long-term protection against re-infection.12\u201314 Identification of immune correlates of protection against MERS-CoV in humans and camels will allow cost-effective disease surveillance and vaccine monitoring.\n\nIn summary, we have demonstrated the utility of the ChAdOx1 platform for MERS-CoV vaccine development in a lethal mouse model. The excellent immunogenicity and efficacy observed here will underpin future evaluations of ChAdOx1 MERS in dromedary camels and humans.\n\nAll data generated or analysed during this study are included in this published article."}
