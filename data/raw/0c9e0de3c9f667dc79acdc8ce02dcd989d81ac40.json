{"title": "Establishing a Liquid-covered Culture of Polarized Human Airway Epithelial Calu-3 Cells to Study Host Cell Response to Respiratory Pathogens In vitro", "body": ", pharmacological compounds [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , and bacterial [7] [8] [9] and viral pathogens, including influenza virus, rhinovirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome -associated coronavirus [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Recently, we demonstrated that Calu-3 cells are susceptible to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in a manner consistent with NHBE 15, 16 . Here, we detail the establishment of a polarized, liquid-covered culture (LCC) of Calu-3 cells, focusing on the technical details of growing and culturing Calu-3 cells, maintaining cells that have been cultured into LCC, and we present the method for performing respiratory virus infection of polarized Calu-3 cells.\n\nTo consistently obtain polarized Calu-3 LCC, Calu-3 cells must be carefully subcultured before culturing in Transwell inserts. Calu-3 monolayer cultures should remain below 90% confluence, should be subcultured fewer than 10 times from frozen stock, and should regularly be supplied with fresh medium. Once cultured in Transwells, Calu-3 LCC must be handled with care. Irregular media changes and mechanical or physical disruption of the cell layers or plates negatively impact polarization for several hours or days. Polarization is monitored by evaluating transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and is verified by evaluating the passive equilibration of sodium fluorescein between the apical and basolateral compartments 17, 18 . Once TEER plateaus at or above 1,000 \u03a9\u00d7cm 2 , Calu-3 LCC are ready to use to examine cellular responses to respiratory pathogens.\n\nThe video component of this article can be found at http://www.jove.com/video/50157/\n\nSafety Measures: Perform all procedures in a biosafety cabinet using sterile culture technique.\n\n1. Prepare EMEM containing 10% FBS (EMEM-10%) and warm in a water bath to 37 \u00b0C. 2. Prepare a 24-well Transwell plate for seeding. Using sterile forceps, move Transwell inserts from the interior to the exterior rows of the plate without touching the insert membrane. Cells should only be subcultured into wells on the exterior rows of the plate. To prevent the introduction of air bubbles into the basolateral compartments, add 600 \u03bcl of EMEM-10% to each one by angling the pipette against the wall of each compartment and slowly releasing the medium into the well. 3. Detach cells from T-75 cm 2 tissue. Subculture flasks using warmed trypsin, and wash in 30 ml of EMEM-20%+S per every 2 flasks of trypsinized cells, as described in step 1.2. 4. Thoroughly resuspend the washed cells in 5 ml of EMEM-10% by gently pipetting up and down. 5. Determine viable and total cell counts by the trypan blue exclusion method. Proceed only if 80% -90% are viable. 6. In a 50 ml sterile conical tube, dilute cells to a concentration of 2 \u00d7 10 6 viable cells/ml with EMEM-10%. 7 . Add cells to the apical compartment of each Transwell. To wells A1 and D1, which will be cell-free control wells, that is, blanks, add 100 \u03bcl of EMEM-10% without cells. To each of the remaining wells, add 100 \u03bcl of resuspended Calu-3 cells, gently angling the pipette against the interior guide channel of the insert wall and slowly releasing the cells. Do not touch the pipette to the insert membrane. To maintain a homogeneous suspension of Calu-3 cells, gently agitate the cell suspension during this seeding step. 8. Incubate Transwell plate at 37 \u00b0C and 7% CO 2 in air atmosphere. Place plate in an incubator where physical disturbance will be minimal. To improve the efficiency of polarization, do not stack plates on top of each other. 9. To maintain cultures until polarized and ready to use in experiments, completely replace medium in Transwells, as described in steps 2.10 through 2.13 below. Medium should be completely replaced three days after being subcultured into Transwells, and then on a cycle alternating between the fourth and then third day after the previous feeding, until cells are fully polarized. 10. Warm EMEM-10% in a water bath to 37 \u00b0C. 11. Gently aspirate medium from Transwell inserts. With a capillary pipette attached to a vacuum trap with a gentle vacuum, or with a standard 1 ml pipette, aspirate medium from cell-free wells A1 and D1, then from seeded wells, first removing apical medium from all wells, and then removing basolateral medium from all wells. Do not touch insert membranes while aspirating medium. 12. Add 200 \u03bcl of EMEM-10% to the apical compartment of cell-free wells A1 and D1, then to the seeded wells, directing the medium into the apical compartment using the side of the insert to guide the pipette tip. Do not add medium directly onto cells, and do not touch the insert membrane. 13. Add 600 \u03bcl of EMEM-10% to the basolateral compartments. To prevent the introduction of air bubbles into the basolateral compartments, add medium to each one by angling the pipette against the wall of each compartment and slowly releasing the medium into the well.\n\n1. Under sterile conditions, transfer the STX2 electrode to a 50 ml centrifuge tube containing 70% ethanol in sterile water, and sterilize 15 min. 2. Calibrate and test the voltohmmeter for use according to manufacturer's directions. 3 . Remove the electrode from the ethanol, air dry 5-10 sec, and rinse the electrode with sterile EMEM-10%. 4 . Set the mode switch of the voltohmmeter to the RESISTANCE setting, and turn power ON. 5. Gently place the electrode into one of the 3 ports that allow access into the basolateral compartment of one Transwell culture. Place electrode so that the longer lead just lightly touches the bottom of the outer well and remains vertical, and the shorter lead is in the tissue culture medium of the apical compartment, without touching the insert membrane. 6. Push \"Measure R\" button, and wait for the reading to stabilize. Repeat for the other 2 ports for each well and record the measurements from all three ports, for a total of three measurements per well. Continue to measure the resistance for all wells of cells. 7. Clean the electrode by soaking 5-10 min in 70% ethanol, rinsing in sterile dH 2 O, and drying thoroughly. Store in the original container. 8. Calculate the resistance of each well, using Equation 1 .\n\nwhere \u03a9 sample is the average measurement from a seeded well and \u03a9 blank is the average measurement from the 2 wells, A1 and D1, containing inserts and medium, but no cells. 9. Calculate the unit area resistance, using Equation 2.\n\nwhere the effective membrane area is 0.33 cm 2 for 24-well Transwell inserts.\n\n2. Verify that polarization is complete by performing a secondary assay, measuring passive sodium fluorescein diffusion between the apical and basolateral compartments, on one to three Transwell cultures. The wells used for the sodium fluorescein assay should be discarded immediately after completion of the assay. \n\nSafety Measures: Perform all procedures in a biosafety cabinet using sterile culture technique, at a biosafety level appropriate for the virus being used.\n\n1. Dilute virus in serum-free EMEM so that desired inocula would be in 100 \u03bcl. 2. Wash cells in serum-free EMEM. Gently aspirate medium from all wells, removing the apical medium then the basolateral medium. With a capillary pipette attached to a vacuum trap with a gentle vacuum, or with a standard 1 ml pipette, aspirate medium from cell-free wells A1 and D1, then from seeded wells, first removing the apical medium from all wells, and then removing the basolateral medium from all wells. Do not touch insert membranes while aspirating medium. 1. Add 100 \u03bcl of serum-free EMEM to the apical compartment of cell-free wells A1 and D1, and then to the seeded wells, directing medium into the apical compartment using the side of the insert to guide the pipette tip. Do not add medium directly on cells, and do not touch the insert membrane. 2. Add 600 \u03bcl of serum-free EMEM to the basolateral compartments. Add medium to each Transwell by angling the pipette against the wall of the compartment and slowly releasing the medium into the well. 3. Gently aspirate serum-free medium from wells.\n\n3. Beginning with uninfected or mock-infected wells, add appropriate virus dilutions to the apical compartment of Transwells. For uninfected wells, add 100 \u03bcl of serum-free EMEM to the apical compartment of appropriate Transwells, for mock-infected wells, add 100 \u03bcl of virus-free preparation diluted in serum-free EMEM to the apical compartment of appropriate Transwells, and for virus infection, dilute virus in serum-free EMEM and add 100 \u03bcl to the apical compartments of appropriate Transwells. 4. Add 600 \u03bcl of serum-free EMEM to all basolateral compartments. 5. Incubate at 37 \u00b0C and 7% CO 2 for 2 hr. 6. Aspirate medium from wells, first from uninfected and mock-infected wells, then from infected wells. Remove apical supernatants first, followed by basolateral supernatants. 7. Replace medium with 200 \u03bcl of EMEM-10% in the apical compartments and 600 \u03bcl of EMEM-10% in the basolateral compartments.\n\nWhen grown as liquid-covered cultures (LCC) in Transwell culture systems, as illustrated in Figure 1 , Calu-3 cells polarize, developing distinct apical and basolateral surfaces. Following the method described here, the trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of Calu-3 LCC reaches a plateau at or above 1,000 \u03a9\u00d7cm 2 within 3 weeks after seeding, an example of which is shown in Figure 2 . The tight junctions formed between polarized cells prevent passive equilibration of small molecules between the apical and basolateral compartments. Thus, a modified sodium fluorescein equilibration assay is used to confirm polarization of Calu-3 LCC 15, 17, 18 . As the TEER of Calu-3 cell monolayers in LCC increases, the amount of fluorescein that passively equilibrates into the basolateral compartment decreases. Once the TEER is 1,000 \u03a9\u00d7cm 2 , the amount of fluorescein that equilibrates into the basolateral compartment is \u2264 1%, as shown in Figure 3 ; therefore, Calu-3 LCC are considered to be fully polarized when the TEER is \u2265 1,000 \u03a9\u00d7cm 2 . The peak TEER measurement of Calu-3 LCC may vary from experiment to experiment. However, once TEER values plateau for any given experiment, a fully polarized, uninfected Calu-3 LCC may be stable for 5 through 12 weeks postseeding. Absence of resistance development in Transwell-cultured Calu-3 may be caused by several factors as outlined in Table 1 . Once the TEER of Calu-3 LCC plateaus at or above 1,000 \u03a9\u00d7cm 2 , the model is ready to be used to examine airway epithelial cell responses to respiratory pathogens, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Exposure to RSV results in a more rapid decline in polarized culture integrity compared to a mock-infection of cells (Figure 4) . \n\nAt each time point, TEER is presented as median \u03a9 x cm 2 \u00b1 SEM of 32 independent wells from one representative experiment.\n\nResistance is not measurable \u2022 Remove any air bubbles in the wells \u2022 Use Calu-3 cells that have been subcultured from frozen stock less than 10 times \u2022 Do not allow Calu-3 cells to reach 100% confluence in monolayer subculture \u2022 Check that cells are not growing on the plastic well below the insert (indicating that cells may have grown through the pores of the insert) \u2022 Allow 2-3 weeks post-seeding for full resistance development \u2022 Check the composition and pore size of inserts used, change if necessary (recommended polyester insert, 0.3 \u03bcm pore size, no coatings, see materials for details) \u2022 Check the quality of the electrode, sanding gently to remove accumulated proteins from the tip, and replacing if necessary \u2022 Check medium for bacterial growth Resistance develops, but full polarization (\u22651,000 \u03a9\u00d7cm 2 ) is not attained \u2022 Allow additional time for polarization to develop (may occasionally take up to 4 weeks) \u2022 Use Calu-3 cells that have been subcultured from frozen stock less than 10 times \u2022 Do not allow Calu-3 cells to reach 100% confluence in monolayer subculture \u2022 Consistently replace medium in Transwell cultures, alternating between the third and then fourth day after previous feeding \u2022 Only culture cells on inserts that are placed in the exterior rows of plates \u2022 Use a different lot of Transwell inserts Cells fully polarize, but resistance is not consistent from one reading to the next \u2022 Do not disrupt or stack plates in the incubator \u2022 Do not cause vibration in the biosafety cabinet while Transwell plates are being handled \u2022 Remove any air bubbles in the wells \u2022 Do not disturb the cell layer with pipette tips when changing media or performing TEER readings \u2022 Use 200 \u03bcl medium in the apical compartment; lower volume may result in unstable TEER readings \u2022 Check the quality of the electrode, sanding gently to remove accumulated proteins from the tip, and replace if necessary \n\nWhen establishing Calu-3 LCC in Transwell inserts, cells may not polarize at all, or may not fully polarize, as defined by a TEER \u2265 1,000 \u03a9\u00d7cm 2 and \u2264 1% sodium fluorescein dye equilibration between the apical and basolateral compartments. In addition, Calu-3 cells in LCC may fully polarize, but TEER may be inconsistent between measurements. Although fluctuations in TEER measurements of Calu-3 LCC are normal from day to day, once fully polarized, dramatic swings in TEER are not expected until the culture naturally declines with age, which may be as little as 5 weeks or as long as 12 weeks after seeding.\n\nThe ability of Calu-3 LCC to polarize depends in part on how cells are maintained and subcultured before use in the Transwell system. Cells that have grown beyond 90% confluence as a monolayer during subculturing, that have been subcultured more than 10 times from frozen stock, or that have not been supplied with fresh medium on a regular schedule are less likely to fully polarize, and any polarization is likely to decline rapidly. Incomplete or total lack of polarization may also be attributed to variation in the material and pore size of Transwells used for Calu-3 LCC, and lot-to-lot variation in Transwells of similar composition and pore size may also affect polarization. Larger pore sizes can allow Calu-3 to grow through the Transwell membrane into the basolateral compartment, preventing the culture from polarizing. An absence of polarization may also be due to bacterial growth, indicated by clouded culture medium, which leads to subsequent breakdown of the tight junctions between Calu-3 cells.\n\nVariable TEER measurements of Calu-3 LCC may be caused by mechanical disruptions of the Calu-3 LCC cell monolayers, the inserts, or the plates themselves. Medium changes and TEER measurements should be performed without pipette tips or electrode leads touching the cells. While performing these operations, care should be taken to avoid introducing air bubbles into the apical and basolateral compartments, which will disrupt the ability of the voltohmmeter to detect resistance. The ability of the voltohmmeter to detect resistance in a culture that is actually polarized may also limited by protein buildup on the electrode leads. This build-up may be removed with gentle sanding, or may be corrected by replacing the electrode.\n\nOnce Calu-3 LCC completely polarize and the TEER is no longer increasing, Calu-3 LCC are ready for use as an in vitro model for characterizing host lung epithelial cell responses to respiratory infection. This system permits better characterization of directional responses to pathogens compared to monolayer-cultured lung cell lines traditionally used to study respiratory pathogens, such as A549 and HEp-2 cells, with the additional advantages of Calu-3 LCC being more rapid to develop, more easily obtained, and less expensive to generate than primary, polarized, differentiated NHBE. Similar to NHBE, polarized Calu-3 demonstrate tight junction formation, and produce mucins. However, unlike NHBE, polarized Calu-3 cells do not differentiate into layers of basal cells and ciliated columnar epithelial cells, and few polarized Calu-3 cells develop cilia-like projections 19 . Thus, although useful for examining polarized responses of airway epithelial cells to respiratory insult, polarized Calu-3 LCC are not an ideal model to examine airway development or remodeling in response to respiratory insult or injury. Mucus production by cultured cells in vitro may impact cellular infectivity, as well as release of infectious virus and virus spread in a polarized model, and a direct comparison of the mucus production between polarized Calu-3 LCC and polarized, differentiated NHBE has not been reported. A549 and HEp-2 cells are easier to culture than Calu-3 cells, however, unlike Calu-3 LCC, they do not form polarized cultures when grown on Transwell inserts, and are thus not ideal models for examining in vitro the responses of polarized epithelial cells to respiratory virus infection.\n\nNo conflicts of interest declared."}
