{"title": "Development of a TaqMan-based real-time RT-PCR assay for the detection of SADS-CoV associated with severe diarrhea disease in pigs", "body": "Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) is a newly discovered virus, which is an enveloped, positive and single-stranded sense RNA virus and belongs to the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae and genus Alphacoronavirus (Zhou et al., 2018; Pan et al., 2017; Woo et al., 2012) . SADS-CoV can cause severe and acute diarrhea and rapid weight loss in piglets less than 6-day-old. From January 2017 to May, the outbreak of SADS-CoV has led to the death of almost 25,000 piglets in southern China and resulted in significant economic losses (data unpublished). Considering the clinical symptoms of this new emerging virus that are similar to those caused by other known swine enteric coronaviruese in China, there is an urgent need to establish a faster and reliable diagnostic technique for identification and quantification of SADS-CoV (Dong et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2016) .\n\nThe real-time PCR using the fluorogenic probe system has been widely used to quantify virus nucleic acids in recent years (Li et al., 2011; Gava et al., 2015; Niu et al., 2016; Dall Agnol et al., 2017) . Compared to the conventional PCR, it allows the accurate and reproducible quantitation of viral gene copies, and has advantages in rapidity, accuracy, reproducibility, and high sensitivity (Li et al., 2016; Fowler et al., 2016) . So far, there is no diagnostic method have been established for the detection of SADS-CoV. In this study, a TaqManbased real-time RT-PCR was designed for SADS-CoV diagnosis and quantification in clinical swine tissue samples.\n\nSADS-CoV virus used in this study was isolated from clinical samples with diarrheal symptoms from pig herds in Guangdong Province of China. Specimens from piglets with signs of severe diarrhea and high mortality were collected from February to August 2017 in four SADS-CoV positive farms.\n\nfor 10 min at 10,000 \u00d7 g. Viral nucleic acid was extracted following the manufacturer's recommendations of AxyPrep TM Body Fluid Viral DNA/ RNA Miniprep Kit (Axygen Scientific, Inc). Reverse transcription was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol of Prime Script TM RT Reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara, Dalian, China), the first step was performed in a total volume of 10 \u03bcL of a mixture containing 2 \u03bcL 5 \u00d7 gDNA Eraser Buffer, 1\u03bcL gDNA Eraser, 1 \u03bcL total RNA and 6 \u03bcL RNase Free dH2O at the condition of 42 \u2103 for 2 min to remove residual genomic DNA, and then, ten microliters of mixture was used in a reaction volume of 20 \u03bcL containing 1 \u03bcL PrimeScript RT Enzyme Mix I, 1 \u03bcL RT Primer Mix, 4 \u03bcL 5 \u00d7 PrimeScript Buffer 2, 4 \u03bcL RNase Free dH 2 O, reactions were conducted with a program that included 37\u00b0C for 15 min, 87\u00b0C for 5 s. All DNA and cDNA templates were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use.\n\nThe genome sequences of SADS-CoV (Accession number: MF094681-MF094684) were retrieved from GenBank. Conserved regions of the N gene were identified by nucleotide sequence alignments with MegAlign7.1.0 (DNAStar, USA). Primers and probe were selected and designed using Primer premers 5.0 to generate a 449 bp amplicon for plasmid and 155 bp real-time RT-PCR product. The probe was labeled with 5-carboxyflourescein(FAM) at the 5\u2032-end and N, N, N' N'tetramethyyl-6-carboxyrhodamine(TAMRA) at the 3\u2032-end. Nucleotide information about primers and probe are summarized in Table 1 .\n\nThe target fragment was obtained with SADS-CoV-N-F/R by PCR and then cloned into pMD19-T vector (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). PCR product was transformed into DH5\u03b1 Escherichia coli cells following the manufacture's recommendations (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) and purified by Plasmid Mini Kit 2 (Omega Bio-tek, USA). The positive recombinant plasmid was confirmed by sequencing (BGI, Shenzhen, China). Subsequently, the SADS-CoV plasmid (pSADS-CoV-N) was quantified by spectrophotometric analysis (NanoDrop ND-1000) and converted into copy number. The plasmid DNA was stored at \u221280 \u2103 in aliquots until use.\n\nThe optimization of the real-time RT-PCR reaction components and cycling conditions was performed using DNA standards. Concentrations of primers, probe and cDNA were selected based on the greatest fluorescence obtained and the lowest threshold cycle. The optimized real-time RT-PCR assays were carried out in 20 \u03bcL reaction mixture containing 10 \u03bcL of Premix Ex Taq (Probe qPCR) (2\u00d7), 0.8 \u03bcL of qSADS-CoV-N-F (10 \u03bcM), 0.8 \u03bcL of qSADS-CoV-N-R (10 \u03bcM), 0.8 \u03bcL (10 \u03bcM) of probe, 1 \u03bcL of cDNA template, and 6.6 \u03bcL of ddH 2 O. The PCR amplification was performed with a CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (BIO-RAD) under the following conditions: 95 \u2103 for 30 s for initial denaturation followed by 45 cycles of 95 \u2103 for 5 s and 62 \u2103 for 30 s. Ten-fold serial dilutions of pSADS-CoV-N, ranging from 10 9 to 10 2 copies/\u03bcL, were tested in five replicates with real-time RT-PCR to generate the standard curve.\n\nThe concentration of the plasmid DNA was 196.455 ng/\u03bcL, equivalent to 3.0 \u00d7 10 10 copies/\u03bcL before dilution. To examine the detection limit of the real-time RT-PCR, plasmid DNA was diluted serially 10-fold with RNase Free ddH 2 O (10 9 -10 2 copies/\u03bcL) as templates. Briefly, conventional RT-PCR was performed by using 1 \u03bcL of diluted cDNA template and 10 \u03bcmol of primers in a 20 \u03bcL reaction volume with the following thermal profile: 50\u00b0C for 30 min, 94\u00b0C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 30 s and a final step of 72\u00b0C for 5 min. And then the detection limit between the real-time RT-PCR and conventional PCR were compared.\n\nThe specificity of the TaqMan \n\nTen-fold serial plasmid dilutions ranging from 3.0 \u00d7 10 2 to 3.0 \u00d7 10 9 copies/\u03bcL were used to assess the coefficients of variation of the real-time RT-PCR. Intra-and inter-assay for Cq values were both included in three different times and quintuplicate.\n\nIn order to evaluate the real-time RT-PCR assay, a total of 174 clinical tissue samples with diarrheal symptoms, including heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, jejunum, ileum, duodenum, tonsil, lymphoglandulae mesentericae and lymphonodi abdominals were collected and quantified by the developed method. The samples amplified before 40 cycles and showed the typical amplification curves were considered to be SADS-CoV positive. Conventional PCR was preformed simultaneously.\n\nTen-fold serial dilutions of DNA plasmids were used to establish a standard curve by plotting the logarithm of the plasmid copy number against the measured Cq values. The standard curve generated had a wide dynamic range of 10 9 -10 2 copies/\u03bcL with a linear correlation (R 2 ) of 0.999 between the Cq value and the logarithm of the plasmid copy number (Fig. 1) .\n\nThe real-time RT-PCR gave positive results for the standard plasmid of SADS-CoV strain (3.0 \u00d7 10 7 copies/\u03bcL) and negative results (Cq > 40) for other porcine viruses, including PEDV, PDCoV, RV, PRRSV, PKV, PSV, PBoV, FMDV, SVDV, SVA, SIV, CSFV, PCV3, TGEV, SA and negative control (RNase Free ddH 2 O) (Fig. 2, Table 2 ).\n\nTo compare the sensitivity of the TaqMan-based real-time RT-PCR Table 1 Primers and probe for SADS-CoV detection.\n\nprimers\n\nSequence ( L. Zhou et al. Journal of Virological Methods 255 (2018) [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] and the conventional PCR, ten-fold serial dilutions of the plasmid pSADS-N were analyzed. The detection limits for the TaqMan-based real-time RT-PCR and the conventional PCR assays were 3.0 \u00d7 10 1 and 3.0 \u00d7 10 2 DNA copies/\u03bcL, respectively (Fig. 3) .\n\nThe coefficient of variation (C.V) in the intra-assay and inter-assay was evaluated. The intra-assay C.Vs of real-time PCR ranged from 0.31% to 1.93%, while the inter-assay C.Vs ranged from 0.14% to 1.86% (Table 3) .\n\nThe developed TaqMan-based real-time RT-PCR assay was evaluated with 174 clinical samples. 123 out of 174 samples were positive for SADS-CoV by the TaqMan-based real-time RT-PCR. When these samples were detected by the conventional PCR, only 89 out of 174 (51.15%) were positive. The established technique increased the positive detection positive rated by 20%. Samples that were tested positively by the conventional PCR were also positive by the real-time RT-PCR. 34 samples were detected negatively by the conventional PCR, while using the TaqMan-based real-time RT-PCR, they were actually positive for SADS-CoV (Table 4) . Fig. 1 . Standard curve of TaqMan-based real-time RT-PCR assay. The assay was conducted using duplicated ten-fold serial dilutions (3.0 \u00d7 10 9 -3.0 \u00d7 10 2 copies/\u03bcL) of the plasmid DNA; y = \u22123.316x + 47.154. \n\nSADS-CoV is a newly identified virus in south China in 2017. Previous methods for the detection of this novel virus have relied on qualitative rather than quantitative PCR (Zhou et al., 2018; Pan et al., 2017; Gong et al., 2017) . The conventional PCR is time-consuming, and it couldn't estimate the amount of viral gene copies, which could be crucial for virus diagnosis and correlations with clinical diseases (Mackay et al., 2002) .\n\nIn this study, we described the development and validation of a TaqMan-based real-time RT-PCR assay for SADS-CoV diagnosis and quantification in 174 clinical samples from piglets affected by severe diarrhea in southern China. The hydrolysis probe employed in this assay was located in the conserved region within the N gene of the viral genome. Results showed that the correlation coefficient of the standard curve in this study was 0.999, much closing to the R 2 of 1 in theory. No cross-reaction signals were observed for fifteen other porcine diseases. The lowest limit of detection was 3.0 \u00d7 10 1 copies/\u03bcL, 10 times more sensitive than the conventional PCR. The intra-assay C.Vs were equal or less than 1.93% and the inter-assay C.Vs were equal or less than 1.86%, indicating the good reproducibility of this assay. The positive rate determined by the new technique was 70.69%, whereas that of the conventional PCR was merely 51.15%, further demonstrating the higher sensitivity of the former method. All these data showed that the TaqMan-based real-time RT-PCR approach was reliable and sensitive.\n\nIn conclusion, the TaqMan-based real-time RT-PCR assay was established in present study for detection and quantification of SADS-CoV in pigs. Because of it remarkable sensitivity, reproducibility and rapidity compared to the conventional PCR, this assay may not only help to resolve diagnosis investigation, but also help to provide knowledge on epidemiology and pathogenesis studies of SADS-CoV.\n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interests with any organization.
