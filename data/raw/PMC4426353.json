{"title": "Chemical and Structural Aspects of Ebola Virus Entry\nInhibitors", "body": "There has been significant recent interest in\nthe use of convalescent antibody therapy or mAbs as postexposure treatments.\nA large number of antibodies for EBOV have been described.47,48 Here we focus on a handful to illustrate key points. From a systemic\nperspective, antibody therapies likely work by preventing viral entry\n(\u201cneutralization\u201d) and/or activation of host complement,\nantibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), or other functions\nrelated to the antibody Fc region. The extent to which these independent\nmechanisms contribute is not completely clear, but most antibody cocktails\nthat have been demonstrated to be effective in small or large animals\ncontain at least one mAb with neutralizing activity in vitro. Key\ncomponents of two first-generation antibody cocktails, namely, MB-003\n(MappBio) and ZMab (Defyrus), were recently combined to yield ZMapp,\nwhich demonstrates increased efficacy. ZMapp is a cocktail of three\nmouse-derived mAbs against EBOV GP that were chimerized into human\nIgG scaffolds (c13C6, c2G4, and c4G7).49\u221251 This cocktail was provided\nfor compassionate use in several human cases this year and has been\ndemonstrated to reverse the course of EVD 5 days post viral challenge\nin NHPs.49 Each of the ZMapp mAbs alone\nis capable of affording partial protection in guinea pigs; two of\nthese mAbs, c2G4 and c4G7, have neutralizing activity in vitro, whereas\nthe third (c13C6) requires complement pathway components.49,52,53 Moreover, recent structural analysis\nhas shown that none of the mutations observed in the currently circulating\nWest Africa EBOV strains occurred within the epitopes of the ZMapp\nantibodies.54,55 In NHPs, convalescent antibody\n(derived from distinct GP-vaccinated animals) provides postexposure\nprotection for both EBOV and MARV, up to 48 h postchallenge, and these\nsera also neutralize in vitro.56 Among\nthe most potent neutralizing antibodies described to date are SUDV-specific\nmAbs 16F6 (murine) and similar synthetic human mAbs, which can neutralize\ninfection by nearly two logs at midnanomolar concentrations.6,57 Two of the synthetic human antibodies (E10 and F4) as well as 16F6\ncan provide postexposure protection >80% in an immunocompromised\nmouse model.57 However, protection of NHPs\nby any antibody therapy has yet to be demonstrated for SUDV. Postexposure\nprotection of NHPs against any filovirus by a single mAb (as opposed\nto polyclonal IgG in convalescent antibody therapies or cocktails\nof mAbs) also has not been shown. An early study indicated that one\nEBOV-specific mAb, KZ52, did not afford protection from challenge,\nbut it is unknown if altered or increased dosing would have made a\ndifference.48,58\n\nAt present, only two antibody\u2013GP\nX-ray crystal structure complexes have been published (Figure 2),6,7 although others are likely forthcoming,\nand single-particle electron microscopy (EM) reconstructions of every\nmAb in the three most efficacious mAb cocktails (MB-003, ZMAb, and\nZMapp) were recently made available.55 Combined,\nthese data show that KZ52, a human EBOV-specific mAb, and 16F6, a\nmurine SUDV-specific mAb, as well as the two chimerized antibodies\nc2G4 and c4G7 bind at similar locations on the overall GP prefusion\nstructure, namely, at the base of the chalice-and-bowl between GP1\nand GP2.5,7,59 Structures\nare not available for the synthetic human mAbs E10 and F4, but competition\nELISA suggests they also bind SUDV GP in a similar location.57 Other components of the protective cocktails,\nc13C6 and c1H3, bind within the glycan cap.55 The KZ52 structural epitope spans both GP1 and GP2, whereas the\n16F6 epitope is contained mostly on GP1; the two structural epitopes\noverlap by 10 residues. These X-ray structures in combination with\nthe structural information on c4G7 and c2G4 suggest that the GP1\u2013GP2\ninterface of the prefusion spike is particularly susceptible for neutralization.5,7 Thus, a potential strategy for isolating additional neutralizing\nantibodies, or non-antibody protein therapeutics, would be to target\nspecifically this region on GP.\n\nOne paradoxical attribute\nof the SUDV mAbs 16F6, E10, and F4 and the EBOV mAb KZ52 is that,\nwhereas KZ52 binds with a low nanomolar dissociation constant, it\nleaves \u223c10% of virus unneutralized at high antibody concentrations\n(>130 nM)6,60,61 in both pseudotype and authentic viral entry assays. In contrast,\n16F6, E10, and F4 are all much more potent against their respective\nGPs, neutralizing 2 logs or \u223c99% at much lower antibody concentrations.\nThese mAbs bind with affinities in the micromolar range and 16F6\nhas a much smaller structural epitope than KZ52.5,6 Within the synthetic antibody panel from which E10 and F4 were discovered\n(all highly related in terms of sequence), there was reasonable correlation\nbetween neutralization potency and binding affinity.57 However, at a broader level it appears that binding affinity\nis not predictive of neutralization potency, nor is neutralization\npredictive of protection in animals. There are likely other regions\nin GP that contain neutralizing epitopes that could be mined to some\nextent by na\u00efve library phage panning or mouse immunizations.\nFurthermore, GP from EBOV is known to undergo some subtle conformational\nchanges upon exposure to low pH or mild denaturants.62,63 It is possible that cryptic epitopes exist and are accessible on\nthe prefusion structure that can be targeted using a variety of approaches.60 Antibodies against the glycan cap and mucin-like\ndomains (e.g., 13F6 and 14G7) provide in vivo protection, but usually\nappear non-neutralizing in vitro, possibly due to the removal of their\nepitopes through cathepsin cleavage in the late endosome.50,53,55,64\n\nFrom the structural and binding data, it is tempting to assume\nthat the mechanism of antibody neutralization is prevention of fusion-associated\nconformational changes, but there is little direct evidence for this.\nInitial cell attachment of filovirus particles is mediated through\nglycans of the heavily glycosylated mucin-like domain, far away from\nthe sites of binding for KZ52, 16F6, E10, and F4, and therefore inhibition\nof cell attachment is not likely part of their mechanism.31,65,66 Additionally, Dias et al. found\nthat 16F6 and KZ52 did not block cellular attachment or inhibit cathepsin\nL cleavage.6 However, because triggering\nof the viral membrane fusion pathway is dependent upon endosomal factors\nsuch as CatL/B, NPC1, and low pH, a model whereby neutralizing antibodies\nfunction by blocking fusion-associated conformational changes would\nnecessitate the antibody\u2013GP complex survives with some reasonable\nlifetime in the endosome. A potential mechanism for KZ52 is to act\nas a \u201cstaple\u201d, locking the two subunits together in\nthe prefusion form, because its structural epitope spans both subunits.7 However, this mechanism would posit that KZ52\nmust remain bound to GP throughout maturation of the endosome, presumably\nto the lysosome where the viral particle is degraded before it has\na chance to infect. A similar mechanism can be proposed for 16F6 and,\nby extension, E10 and F4, but the 16F6 structural epitope is contained\nmostly on GP1; thus it is less clear how 16F6 binding can occlude\nGP2 conformational rearrangements as efficiently as KZ52.5 A structural and mechanistic dissection of these\npotential neutralization mechanisms may lend itself to the design\nof new, more potent antibodies or protein therapeutics. Moreover,\nefficient antibody-mediated protection likely requires a mixture of\nantibodies that recognize both the GP1\u2013GP2 interface and the\nouter regions of the GP. In regard to this, KZ52, which failed to\nprovide protection as a single mAb in NHP studies,58 might be effective in an adequate antibody cocktail.\n\nPeptides present an alternative to antibodies\nfor targeting proteins, owing to their ease of synthesis in small\nscale and potential for chemical modification to improve features\nsuch as structure and stability. Precisely folded peptides can be\nutilized to engage in numerous energetically favorable contacts over\na relatively large surface. In addition, peptides serve as excellent\ntools to identify key pharmacophores and can act as templates on which\nsmall molecules that mimic those interactions can be developed. One\nFDA-approved peptide drug is the human immunodeficiency virus type\n1 (HIV-1) fusion inhibitor Fuzeon (enfurvitide/T-20), which corresponds\nto the CHR of the gp41 fusion subunit.67 It is thought that Fuzeon and related peptides (\u201cC-peptides\u201d)\nwork by binding the NHR segments during the extended/pre-hairpin intermediate\nand preventing formation of the six-helix bundle that is critical\nfor membrane fusion. This approach has been applied to several class\nI viruses, and similar concepts have been applied to class II viruses.68,69\n\nEarly attempts to develop C-peptides against filoviruses yielded\nmixed results; one report showed that a peptide corresponding to the\nCHR could reduce the infectivity of pseudotyped virus, albeit at high\nconcentrations, but another study suggested similar peptides had little\nactivity.70,71 One potential issue with development of\na filovirus C-peptide is accessibility of the putative target, the\ntransient extended intermediate. It is presumed that the initial membrane\nfusion events are not triggered until the virus is deep within the\nendocytic pathway, because early steps require host endosomal resident\nproteins (CatL/CatB and NPC1).36,40 Therefore, any therapeutic\nseeking to engage mid- or late-stage fusion intermediates, such as\nthe GP2 extended intermediate, would have to be present in endosomal\ncompartments.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, targeted EBOV C-peptides\nhave been developed in which CHR segments are localized to endosomal\ncompartments or membranes by conjugation to cell penetrating peptide\n(CPP) domains or cholesterol. One study demonstrated that the potency\nof C-peptide inhibitors can be substantially enhanced by conjugation\nto the HIV-1 Tat arginine-rich sequence (referred to as Tat-Ebo).72 The antiviral activity of these endosome-targeting\npeptides is dependent on both the Tat sequence and the native EBOV\nCHR sequence. Mechanistic studies suggested that the peptide acts\nby blocking a membrane fusion intermediate, although this was not\nunequivocally demonstrated, but defects were evident in late-stage\nentry steps. However, the concentrations of peptide required for substantial\nreduction in viral infection are likely too high for the C-peptide\nto be of clinical relevance. Subsequent efforts focused on the generation\nand characterization of C-peptides conjugated to cholesterol and Tat-Ebo\nanalogues containing covalent side chain\u2013side chain cross-links\nto promote \u03b1-helical conformation.73 Although the mechanism of inhibition appears to be unspecific (the\npeptides also showed activity against the vesicular stomatitis virus\nglycoprotein G), the cholesterol-conjugated C-peptides were potent\ninhibitors of EBOV glycoprotein-mediated cell entry. Interestingly,\nit was found that cholesterol conjugation enhances \u03b1-helical\nstructure in a concentration-independent manner. These results highlight\nthat caution must be exercised in considering cholesterol conjugated\nC-peptides as a general therapeutic approach to improve the antiviral\nactivity of C-peptide analogues of class I fusion proteins. In the\nspecific case of EBOV, conjugation to cholesterol enhanced potency\nbut at the cost of specificity. Moreover, side chain\u2013side chain\ncross-linking enhanced \u03b1-helical stability of the Tat-Ebo variants\nonly at neutral pH. However, one side chain\u2013side chain cross-linked\npeptide with moderately higher activity than the parent compound Tat-Ebo\nwas identified. Recently, a mirror image phage display strategy was\nutilized to develop reverse chirality peptides (d-peptides)\nthat bind to mimics of the EBOV extended intermediate.74\n\nAlthough MARV does not produce a \u0394-peptide\n(C-terminal cleavage product of sGP secreted by Ebola virus-infected\ncells), Fc-tagged versions of EBOV, SUDV, and TAFV \u0394-peptides\nspecifically inhibited entry by Ebolaviruses and Marburg virus, indicating\nthat they interfere with a pathway used by all filoviruses to gain\nentry into their target cells.75 It seems\nlikely that other aspects of GP-mediated viral entry could be targeted\nwith peptides, perhaps acting as starting points for the development\nof small molecules or themselves acting as potential therapeutic candidates.\nFor example, cyanovirin N (CVN) is a small 10 kDa glycan-binding protein\nthat binds mannose-containing oligosaccharides and, thus, inhibits\nviral entry of diverse enveloped viruses that possess glycoproteins\nwith a high density of oligomannose glycosylation sites, including\nHIV-1, hepatitis C, measles, and EBOV, presumably by preventing initial\nvirus glycan\u2013cell interactions.76\u221278 CVN was also able to\ndelay death due to EBOV challenge in a murine model, although this\nrequired multiple high doses.76 Given this,\nit is conceivable that other peptide inhibitors that can prevent virus\u2013cell\nattachment may hold promise as entry inhibitors and would have the\nadded advantage that they need not function in the endosome. Later\npoints in the entry pathway might also be susceptible to inhibition\nby peptides including virus\u2013receptor interactions.\n\nA unique advantage that small molecules possess, particularly in\nthe context of emergency prophylactic or postexposure therapeutics,\nis that they are orally available and would likely not require refrigeration.\nNumerous small molecule therapeutics against the filoviruses have\nbeen described, some with demonstrated efficacy in nonhuman primates.\nThese compounds fall into a broad range of mechanistic classes, perhaps\nthe most advanced being polymerase inhibitors;79 we focus here on entry inhibitors. An overview of lead\ncompounds and their targets is shown in Table 2. Roughly speaking, these small molecules can be categorized as follows:\n(i) broad-spectrum viral entry inhibitors, targeting host proteases\nor the viral membrane; (ii) inhibitors that target specifically elements\nof filovirus entry, such as GP or NPC1; and (iii) FDA-approved therapeutics\nthat have been repurposed for filoviruses but for which the mechanisms\nof action are unclear (cationic amphiphiles).\n\nWithin the first category\nare numerous cysteine cathepsin inhibitors. Cysteine cathepsin proteases\nare susceptible to mechanism-based suicide inhibitors such as epoxide-containing\nor diazomethane-containing compounds.36 Using the selective CatB inhibitor CA074 and the CatL/CatB inhibitor\nFYdmk, an essential role for CatB and an accessory role for CatL in\nEBOV GP-dependent target cell entry could be identified. More recent\nefforts for targeting CatL include oxocarbazate80 or more diverse structures isolated from a library screen.81 In all cases, inhibition was observed with pseudotyped\nvirus cell-based entry assays and with authentic viruses in some cases.\nIn vitro, there appears to be a strong but not absolute dependence\non CatB for GP-mediated entry by some filoviruses (EBOV, TAFV, BDBV),\nwhereas CatL is less critical.36,37,82 Other filoviruses (SUDV and MARV) do not require CatB.82 In vivo, CatB and CatL knockout mice are both\nstill susceptible to EBOV infection and death, suggesting that redundant\nproteolytic mechanisms may exist.83 Moreover,\nEBOV can readily adapt to use non-CatB cysteine cathepsins, at least\nin tissue culture, and a similar situation may exist in animals. Thus,\na likely requirement for filovirus entry inhibitors is potent, broad-spectrum\ninhibition of cysteine proteases residing in the endocytic pathway\nof all cells. Targeting a general mechanism such as cathepsin cleavage\nmay prove advantageous in that such agents could be used for other\nendosomal viruses that also require these proteases (such as severe\nacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS-CoV);81 however, a potential disadvantage may be toxicity due to\nloss of host protease function. A critical consideration for these\ncompounds may be whether systemic toxicity (if any) can be tolerated\nwithin the required treatment window for postexposure therapy. Several\nof the epoxide-based cathepsin inhibitors are well-tolerated in mice\nupon prolonged administration, an important factor in the consideration\nof compounds with this mechanism of action.84\u221286\n\nAn alternative\nto targeting a general host factor is to target the viral membrane,\na task that has been accomplished recently with the aryl methyldiene\nrhodanine derivative LJ001.87 The proposed\nmechanism of this compound and its derivates is specific intercalation\ninto membranes. Unlike biogenic mammalian cells, virions lack the\nability to repair membrane damage. Thus, while being capable of binding\nboth membrane types, LJ001 inhibits only virus\u2013cell but not\ncell\u2013cell fusion, because the intercalation probably causes\ndefects in membrane architecture, and the activation of a thioxo functionality\nleads to local membrane damage. LJ001 had potent in vitro antiviral\nactivity against EBOV and a number of other enveloped viruses, including\ninfluenza A, flaviviruses, poxviruses, and HIV-1. Although 80% of\nmice pretreated with LJ001 survived a lethal dose of mouse-adapted\nEBOV challenge, LJ001 did not show efficacy in postexposure mouse\nmodel experiments due to a suboptimal pharmacokinetic profile. Nonetheless,\nthese results provide proof-of-concept that a general membrane-targeted\nreagent could serve as a broad-spectrum antiviral.\n\nUpon cleavage,\nthe protein\u2013protein interaction between cleaved GP1 and NPC1\nis critical for triggering the membrane fusion machinery, although\nit remains to be determined if other factors are involved.39,40 Both genetic and chemical ablations of this interaction have been\nshown to reduce infectivity in vitro and, in NPC1 heterozygotic (NPC1+/\u2212 mice), there is a substantial resistance to both\nEBOV and MARV lethal challenge. Protein\u2013protein interactions\nhave been a challenging class of targets for antagonism with small\nmolecules, because interfacial surfaces are usually large, dynamic,\nand lack deep binding pockets into which a small molecule could bind\nand efficiently occlude the interaction.88 Nonetheless, an adamantane class of compounds (e.g., 3.47) appears to function by preventing GP binding to NPC1.40 A parent compound, 3.0, was identified\nfrom a small molecule screen for inhibition of pseudotyped virus infection,\nspecific to EBOV GP. Subsequent structure\u2013activity relationship\n(SAR) analysis and pull-down experiments suggested this class interacts\ndirectly with NPC1 and inhibits a GP\u2013NPC1 interaction.89 However, neither a direct KD measurement nor structural evidence of the small molecule\u2013NPC1\ninteraction has been reported. A separate small molecule screen identified\na benzodiazepine derivative (compound 7), which likely\ntargets a hydrophobic pocket (S2) at the GP1\u2013GP2 interface\nin the prefusion conformation, as evidenced by ablation of activity\nupon mutation of specific GP residues.90 Whereas it remains to be determined whether compound 7 inhibits GP\u2013NPC1 interactions or prevents GP-associated conformational\nchanges, these studies suggest that the S2 hydrophobic pocket can\nserve as a well-defined small molecule drug target for the inhibition\nof EBOV infection.\n\nA third mechanistic class includes cationic\namphiphiles, which have been isolated from multiple screens of FDA-approved\ndrugs. For example, the selective estrogen receptor modulators clomiphene,\nused as an infertility treatment to induce ovulation, and toremifiene,\nused as a breast cancer chemotherapeutic, both inhibit EBOV infection\nin vitro at a late-stage entry step.91 A\nbroader panel of cationic amphiphiles has recently been shown to have\nsimilar activities,92 and an independent\nstudy identified amiodarone,93 used to\ntreat cardiac arrhythmias, and other ion channel inhibitors with similar\nproperties. The precise mechanism by which cationic amphiphiles inhibit\nviral entry is not completely understood, but it appears that they\nare distinct from that of 3.47 in that they do not directly\ninhibit the GP\u2013NPC1 interaction. Alternative proposed mechanisms\ninclude allosteric modulation of NPC1, disruption of NPC1 by general\ndisfunction of the endolysosomal membrane, and interaction with a\nyet-unidentified additional required host factor.91,92 Although the prospect of repurposing FDA-approved drugs for use\nas antifilovirus drugs is appealing from the standpoint that these\nagents have already passed safety studies, it is important to emphasize\nthat dosing will likely be a critical issue. Such compounds likely\nhave a very specific treatment window for their intended indications,\nand their use as antifilovirus drugs may require increased amounts\nto combat the high viral titers that may go beyond the approved therapeutic\nwindow. Nonetheless, the in vitro data for these compounds are compelling\nenough to warrant further evaluation in animals.\n\nIn addition\nto the classes listed above, Yermolina et al. reported a newly developed\nantifiloviral screening system based on EBOV-GP pseudotyped HIV particles\nto identify compound 8a, which selectively inhibited\nEBOV and MARV infection in human cells.94 Although subsequent modifications improved the antiviral activity\nof this lead compound, its mode of entry inhibition remains to be\nelucidated.\n\nAmong the three\nclasses of entry inhibitors discussed here, antibodies are the most\nadvanced in terms of development. Although the efficacy of cocktails,\nsuch as ZMapp, for EBOV in nonhuman primates is clear, a challenge\nmoving forward will be to identify similar treatments for other filoviruses.\nThe convalescent serum protection studies with MARV suggest that it\ncan also be targeted with appropriate antibody therapies. Furthermore,\nanalysis of sera in NHPs treated with one broad vaccine candidate,\na mixture of vesicular stomatitis virus particles containing GPs from\nEBOV, SUDV, and BDBV, suggests that induction of neutralizing antibodies\nis a significant component of vaccine-induced protection.95 It therefore seems likely that protection from\nother filovirus species with mAb cocktails is possible and that cross-protection\nwith appropriately engineered cross-neutralizing cocktails or broadly\nneutralizing antibodies merits investigation. In addition, further\nmolecular studies on the mechanism of neutralization may yield new\ninsight into how to develop more potent and effective mAbs for future\ndevelopment.\n\nPeptide inhibitors of viral membrane fusion have\nyielded important mechanistic insights into infection, but a critical\nchallenge for use of these compounds will be their in vivo half-life\nand whether the extended intermediate is accessible enough to be a\nviable therapeutic target. One HIV-1 C-peptide, fuzeon/enfurvirtide/T-20,\nhas provided some clinical utility; however, filovirus C-peptides\nhave the added complication that they must be delivered to endosomes\nof susceptible cell types at high enough levels to induce a therapeutic\neffect. Whereas conjugation to various targeting agents (CPP or cholesterol)\nwas an interesting and straightforward strategy, this approach may\nalso divert the peptides to a broad number of cell types and therefore\ndilute antiviral activity. Furthermore, cationic peptides in general\nsuffer from high systemic toxicity. Nonetheless, such agents could\nlikely serve as valuable research reagents, and new peptides could\nbe developed to target other aspects of the entry pathway.\n\nSmall\nmolecule entry inhibitors that target the host or virus may prove\nto be clinically useful, especially when considered as part of a cocktail\nwith compounds that inhibit viral replication (e.g., polymerase chain\nterminators). A critical challenge moving forward will be identifying\ncompounds that exhibit therapeutic effects in animal models within\nreasonable treatment windows. Evaluation of these compounds in mouse\nprotection models will be critical to prioritizing them for potential\ntherapeutic efficacy. As with antibodies, additional mechanistic information\nspecifically for the cationic amphiphiles will be beneficial from\nboth the basic and applied perspectives. Finally, one unexplored area\nis the potential for combination of antibody and small molecules as\nantibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs). This approach is widely popular\nfor cancer therapies, and proof-of-concept has been demonstrated for\nHIV-1.96,97 Such an approach could leverage the specificity\nof monoclonal antibodies with the in vitro potency of small molecule\ninhibitors.\n\nFilovirus entry is a complicated process requiring\nmultiple endosomal components. The inhibitors discussed herein are\nthought to function at a variety of steps including cell attachment\n(CVN), proteolytic processing (cathepsin inhibitors), host receptor\ninteraction (3.47), and other aspects of membrane fusion\n(C-peptides, cationic amphiphiles, and antibodies). Which of these\nsteps is most susceptible in vivo remains to be determined, but those\nagents that target the early prefusion intermediates of GP have the\nadded advantage that they do not require delivery to the endosome\nfor function. Nonetheless, strategies that seek to disrupt these specific\nsteps in the pathway have all been validated in vitro, and some in\nvivo, thereby paving the way for other structural and chemical approaches\nto the development of filovirus entry inhibitors."}
