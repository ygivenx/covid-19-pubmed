{"title": "Identification of viruses with the potential to infect human", "body": "Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on Earth and exist in all habitats of the world (Paez-Espino, Eloe-Fadrosh et al. 2016) . They can infect all kinds of organisms ranging from the bacteria to animals, including the human. Humans are constantly exposed to a large diversity of viruses, and over two-thirds of all human pathogens belong to viruses (Woolhouse and Gaunt 2007) . The viruses have caused huge mortality and morbidity to the human society in human history, such as the devastating smallpox and Spanish flu. Although much progress have been made in prevention and control of viral infectious disease, recent serial outbreaks caused by the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (Breban, Riou et al. 2013) , avian influenza H7N9 virus (Gao, Cao et al. 2013) , Ebola virus (Maganga, Kapetshi et al. 2014) and Zika virus (Mlakar, Korva et al. 2016) indicate that the viruses still pose a serious threat to the global public health.\n\nThe virome which could infect humans is far from complete. Generally speaking, a new pathogen would not be identified until it caused epidemics or pandemics. Many viruses may remain undiscovered, even if they have already entered into human populations (Rosenberg 2015) . Traditional diagnostic methods such as polymerase chain reaction, immunological assays and pan-viral microarrays are limited in their ability to identify novel viruses with the potential to infect humans. Rapid development of viral metagenomic sequencing in recent years provides a powerful high-throughput and culture-independent means to identify new viruses, which leads to accumulation of new viruses at an unprecedented pace (Alavandi and Poornima 2012) . The Global Virome Project (GVP), which was proposed and initiated in the beginning of 2018, estimated that there were over 1.67 million yet-to-be-discovered viruses in animal reservoirs, and between 631,000 to 827,000 of these unknown viruses have the capacity to infect humans (Carroll, Daszak et al. 2018) . Therefore, it is in great need to develop rapid methods for identifying viruses with the potential to infect humans.\n\nTwo kinds of methods, the sequence alignment-based and alignment-free methods, have been developed to predict the host for viruses. For example, several methods based on k-mers, which were extracted from viral genomes (Ahlgren, Ren et al. 2016, . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/597963 doi: bioRxiv preprint Li and Sun 2018) , and several methods based on sequence blast, have been developed to predict the host of the phage (Bolotin, Quinquis et al. 2005 , Edwards, McNair et al. 2015 . Some studies have also attempted to identify the human virus with these methods. For example, Xu et al. (Xu, Tan et al. 2017) developed SVM models to predict the host of influenza viruses based on word vectors. However, all these studies have focused some type of viruses, such as coronavirus and influenza virus. The methods they developed were not suitable for identification of novel human-infecting viruses from the viral metagenomic sequences. Here, we attempted to build machine learning models for rapid identification of viruses with the potential to infect human.\n\nThe virus with specific hosts and the viral genomic sequences were obtained from the database of Virus-Host DB (available at https://www.genome.jp/virushostdb/) on July 15, 2018 (Mihara, Nishimura et al. 2016) . After removing the viroid and satellites, and the viruses with genomic sequence less than 1kb, a total of 9428 viruses were kept for further analysis, which included 1236 viruses infecting humans, which were defined as human-infecting viruses, and 8192 viruses infecting other species.\n\nThe machine learning models of k-nearest neighbor (KNN) (k=1), support vector machine (SVM) (using the linear kernel function), gaussian naive bayes classifier (GNBC), random forest (RF) (with default settings) and logistic regression (LR) (with default settings) were built with the default parameters using the package \"scikit-learn\" (version 0.20.2) (Pedregosa, Varoquaux et al. 2011) in Python (version 3.6.2).\n\nBecause the number of human-infecting viruses was much smaller than that of other viruses, the functions of \"BalanceBaggingClassifier\" (Breiman 1996 , Barandiaran 1998 ) and \"BalanceRandomForest\" (Chen, Liaw et al. 2004) in the package of \"imbalanced-learn\" (version 0.4.3) in Python were used to deal with the imbalance .

Ten-fold cross-validations were used to evaluate the predictive performances of the machine learning models, and were conducted using the functions of 'StratifiedKFold' in the package \"scikit-learn\" in Python. To measure the predictive performances of the machine learning models, the area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC), the accuracy, recall rate, specificity and predictive precision were calculated for each model.\n\nAll the statistical analysis was conducted in R (version 3.5.0).\n\nA total of 9428 viruses were used in the study. Among them, 1236 viruses were reported to infect humans, which were defined as the human-infecting virus. They \n\nTo discriminating the human-infecting virus from other viruses, several machine-learning models, including k-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF), gaussian naive bayes classifier (GNBC), support-vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression (LR), were built based on k-mer frequencies in the viral genome. K-mers of one to six nucleotides were used in the models to evaluating the influence of the k-mer length on the model performance (Table S1 ). Figure 2 showed that the AUC of GNBC, SVM and LR models increased as the increase of the k-mer length from one to six. While for KNN and RF, the AUCs of them peaked at k-mer length of 4 and 3, respectively; then, they began to decrease as the increase of k-mer length. The AUCs of KNN and RF were much larger than those of other models, including GNBC, SVM\n\nand LR, at all length of k-mers, suggesting that the KNN and RF outperformed other models in discriminating the human-infecting virus from other viruses.

Rapid determination of the human-infecting virus from metagenomic sequences is important for early warnings of newly emerging viruses. To mimic the metagenomic sequences, viral genomes .

The number of contigs of varying length in the human-infecting virus and other viruses were listed in Table S2 .\n\nSince the KNN model performed best in discriminating the human-infecting virus from other viruses, it was used to identify the human-infecting virus based on contigs of varying length. For the contigs of a given length, KNN models for discriminating the human-infecting virus and other viruses were built with k-mers of different size (Table S3 ). As was shown in Figure 3 , for contigs of all length, the AUC of KNN models increased as the increase of k-mer length from one to four. The best performance was achieved for all models with k-mers of four nucleotides long. The longer the contigs were, the better the models performed in identifying the human-infecting virus ( Figure 3 and Table 2 model not only achieved excellent overall performances, but also had high sensitivity in identifying the human-infecting virus.\n\nIn conclusion, this study for the first time built the computational models to predict the human-infecting virus in the perspective of virome. The high accuracy and sensitivity of the KNN model built on the viral contigs of varying length suggests that the model could be used to identify the human-infecting virus from the viral metagenomic sequences. This work could help for discovery of novel human-infecting virus in metagenomics studies.\n\nAhlgren, N. A., et al.
