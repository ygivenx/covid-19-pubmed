{"title": "Evaluating interest in an influenza A(H5N1) vaccine among laboratory workers who work with highly-pathogenic avian influenza viruses in the United States", "body": "Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, including influenza A(H5N1) viruses, cause severe respiratory disease and death in birds and have been found in poultry and wild birds in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America [1] . A(H5N1) viruses can also cause severe disease in humans. From 2003 through 2016, 16 countries reported 856 human infections of A (H5N1) virus, with 452 deaths (53% case fatality proportion), to the World Health Organization (WHO) [2] . Most human infections with A(H5N1) virus occur from contact with infected birds or environments, but limited human-to-human transmission has been reported [3] [4] [5] [6] .\n\nA(H5N1) viruses are considered to have moderate pandemic potential, and research to understand transmission and adaptability, and to develop vaccines, are public health priorities [7] [8] [9] [10] . Laboratory work with A(H5N1) viruses is necessary to further our understanding of these viruses and the risk they pose to public health, and to develop vaccines. While best practices for working with HPAI viruses protect individuals from exposure, including enhanced BSL3 practices, some risk of inadvertent exposure exists [11] [12] [13] Vaccination is the primary method of preventing seasonal influenza and an important tool to prevent pandemic influenza [14] . In recent years, substantial research has been conducted on A(H5N1) vaccines, resulting in the development of licensed vaccine products for use during future pandemics and for pandemic stockpiles [7] . In 2013, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) Working Group on Influenza Vaccines and Immunizations updated their general recommendations on A(H5N1) vaccines to include use before pandemics (i.e., inter-pandemic) and strongly recommended vaccination of laboratory personnel working with A (H5N1) viruses [7] . In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Division of Select Agents and Toxins made specific recommendations for vaccination with an A(H5N1) vaccine for all laboratory workers working with influenza viruses containing hemagglutinin from the influenza A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 lineage [13] . However, without a licensed, available vaccine for use during the inter-pandemic period, access to A(H5N1) vaccine among laboratory personnel in the United States has been limited to participation in clinical trials.\n\nA(H5N1) vaccines are not commercially produced in the United States, but the U.S. government supported limited production for testing and for pandemic stockpiles [15, 16] . There are currently doses of four A(H5N1) monovalent vaccines in the U.S. stockpile. The U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) licensed two of these for use in the United States during a pandemic [17] . FDA licensed Q-Pan H5N1 in 2013 for use in persons aged 18 years at increased risk of occupational exposure to influenza A(H5N1) virus. The vaccine contains antigen from the influenza A/Indonesia/05/2005 virus strain (Clade 2.1.3.2) and is intended to be administered with an oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant, AS03. The vaccine was prepared under contract with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as part of the national pandemic preparedness initiative. The U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recently considered the use of a small amount (<3000 doses) of stockpiled Q-Pan H5N1 vaccine for persons with occupational exposure to HPAI virus (e.g., laboratory workers) during the inter-pandemic period [18] .\n\nTo assess the demand for an A(H5N1) vaccine among laboratory personnel working with HPAI viruses, we conducted a survey to help guide decisions as to whether the stockpiled vaccine should be made available for persons at risk of occupational exposure during the inter-pandemic period. The primary objective was to quantify the demand for Q-Pan H5N1 vaccine among persons working in laboratories registered with the USDA to work with HPAI viruses. Secondary objectives were to describe and categorize the type and amount of work with HPAI viruses among laboratory workers, quantify the average weekly person-hours of work with various HPAI viruses, and identify access to an occupational health clinic through which a vaccine could be administered.\n\nHPAI viruses are designated as Select Agents in the United States, and therefore any entity working with HPAI in the United States must register with the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Agriculture Select Agent Services. USDA identi-fied 42 entities registered to work with HPAI in 2016, and sent an email containing information and a link to the electronic survey to all Responsible Officials and Alternate Responsible Officials at each of the identified entities. Each entity was requested to share the survey with principal investigators (PIs) working with HPAI viruses and all laboratory workers with access to their biosafety level 3 enhanced (BSL-3E) laboratory in which work with HPAI viruses are carried out. No identifying information was collected from respondents. CDC had no direct contact with respondents or institutions. The survey period was from August to September 2016. The survey and report were determined not to constitute human subjects research, but rather public health response.\n\nA web survey was created using Epi Info 7.0. The survey contained 21 questions pertaining to demographic characteristics, type of work with HPAI viruses, weekly person-hours of work with HPAI viruses, interest in HPAI and A(H5N1) vaccines, and access to vaccination through occupational health clinics. Additional information about Q-Pan H5N1 was not provided in the survey. PIs were asked to complete the self-administered electronic questionnaire accessed through a secure link, and to forward the secure link to all staff in their laboratory with access to a BSL-3E laboratory area where HPAI experiments occur. PIs were asked to request that all such staff complete the survey. PIs were also asked to report the number of persons in their laboratory with access to the BSL-3E laboratory in order to obtain the number of persons who would have received the survey. A reminder email was sent to all Responsible Officials and Alternate Responsible Officials at each of the identified institutions 2 weeks after the initial email.\n\nDescriptive analysis of survey responses was performed using SAS 9.3. To estimate a response rate among PIs, we used a denominator of 173, the number of PIs registered in 2014 (database limitations prevented estimation of this number in later years). We estimated the response rate by occupational category using the numbers provided by each PI. Analysis was limited to those respondents who reported working in the BSL-3E area where HPAI experiments occur (and therefore could have been exposed to live virus or virus particles) with sub-analyses limited to those who worked directly with A(H5N1) viruses. Given that laboratory personnel may have varying work schedules in the BSL-3E area depending on occupational category and work (e.g., concentrated intermittent vs. regularly scheduled weekly hours), we asked respondents to estimate percentages of their total work time spent on various types of work with HPAI or A(H5N1) (<10%, 10-25%, 26-50%, 51-75% or >75%). To calculate the average time spent on each type of work with HPAI viruses, we multiplied the lower (1% for <10%, 10% for 10-25%, 26% for 26-50%, 51% for 51-75%, and 76% for >75%) and upper range (9% for <10%, 25% for 10-25%, 50% for 26-50%, 75 for 51-75% and 100% for >75%) of time spent performing each type of activity by either 40 h per week (if the respondent indicated that they were full-time staff), or 20 h per week (for parttime staff/employees). The means of the lower percentage and upper percentage were calculated across occupational categories to give a mean range of hours per week.\n\nWe received 131 responses, including 33 who self-identified as PIs (33 of 173 registered with USDA, 19% response rate) (Fig. 1) .\n\nThe 33 PIs reported a combined 126 research scientists, 70 postdoctoral fellows, 230 research technicians, 33 students, 86 animal care workers, and 102 other staff with access to their BSL-3E laboratories where HPAI experiments occurred. The overall response rate among laboratory workers of responding PIs was 98 of 647 possible respondents (15%). The response rate varied by occupational category (Fig. 1) . We received responses from 26 research scientists (26/126, 21%), 15 post-doctoral fellows (15/70, 21%), 24 research technicians (24/230, 10%), 6 students (6/33, 18%), 1 animal care worker (1/86, 1.2%) and 26 from other roles, such as biosafety program staff and laboratory management (26/102, 25%).\n\nAll further analysis was limited to the 100 respondents who reported working in the BSL-3E area where HPAI experiments occur (Fig. 1 ). This included 26 PIs, 21 research scientists, 10 post-doctoral fellows, 20 research technicians, 6 students, 1 animal care workers, and 16 other workers. Half of respondents were female and 63% were between 25 and 44 years of age ( Table 1 ). The majority of respondents worked at universities (49%) or federal government institutions (34%). Respondents reported a median of 8 years working in a BSL-3E laboratory and 6 years specifically working on HPAI viruses.\n\nRespondents reported a mean of 5.1-11.7 h per week in the BSL-3E laboratory. Seventy-eight (78%) reported working directly with either HPAI viruses or specimens from suspected HPAI cases, or animals infected or inoculated with HPAI viruses. The most common HPAI viruses with which respondents worked were A(H5N1) (65%), A(H5N2) (26%), A(H5N8) (21%) and A(H7N7) (21%).\n\nSixty-six respondents (66%) reported working with live HPAI virus (e.g., in cell culture) for an average of 4. \n\nOf the 100 respondents who reported working in a BSL-3E area where HPAI experiments occurred, 88 of 90 respondents (98%) reported receiving a 2015-16 seasonal influenza vaccine and 12 of 93 respondents (13%) had participated in a vaccine trial for an influenza vaccine (either seasonal or pandemic). Forty of 92 respondents (43%) had heard of the Q-Pan H5N1 vaccine prior to the survey. When asked if they would be interested in receiving Q-Pan H5N1 vaccine if offered at their institution, 45 of 91 respondents (49%) said ''Yes,\" 35 (38%) said they ''Might be interested but needed more information,\" and 11 (12%) said ''No.\" Interest in receiving Q-Pan H5N1 varied by occupational category and was highest among students (80%) and lowest among PIs (42%), postdocs (40%) and other workers (33%) (Fig. 2) . Interest in receiving the vaccine also varied with the amount of reported time spent working in the BSL-3E laboratory (Fig. 3) . Interest was highest among those who spent >50% of their time in a BSL-3E laboratory (64%) and lowest in those who spent <10% of their time in the BSL-3E laboratory (39%). Interest in Q-Pan H5N1 vaccine was similar by type of work performed with HPAI viruses (e.g. work with live virus, suspect cases, or infected or inoculated animals). Of those who had participated in an influenza vaccine trial in the past, 8 (or 67%) reported that they would be interested in receiving Q-Pan H5N1 vaccine.\n\nOf the persons who replied that they might be interested or they were not interested in the vaccine, the most common reasons were ''I don't think the vaccine would provide any further protection on top of my current safety practices\" (61%), followed by ''I have concerns about the safety of the adjuvant in the vaccine\" (26%) ( Table 3 ). In addition to Q-Pan H5N1 vaccine, 69 of 90 respondents (77%) answered that they would be interested in vaccines against other HPAI viruses if they were licensed by FDA and available. Eighty-six of 91 respondents (95%) reporting having an occupational health clinic at their place of work and 73 of those (85%) had received any vaccine at this clinic previously.\n\nIn our survey of laboratorians working with HPAI viruses, A (H5N1) was the most commonly used virus. Multiple different A (H5N1) virus strains were used by respondents and one third worked with A/Indonesia/05/2005, the strain included in the Q- Pan H5N1 vaccine. Respondents spent an average of 5.1-11.7 h per week working in a BSL-3E area where HPAI experiments occur, with the most time spent working with specimens from suspected HPAI cases. Half of respondents were interested in receiving the Q-Pan H5N1 vaccine, and another 38% wanted more information.\n\nReasons given for lack of interest in the vaccine related to belief that the vaccine would not provide additional benefit on top of current safety practices and safety concerns about the adjuvant. We found that among our respondents, students were among those with the most time spent working with HPAI viruses, includ-ing working with live virus, samples from suspect cases, and inoculated animals. In general, laboratory-acquired infections associated with any work in BSL-3 or 4 laboratories are rare [19, 20] . Information about occupational categories or years of experience in advanced biosafety laboratories are not usually reported, but at least one student is known to have been infected with SARS coronavirus in the laboratory [21] . Student respondents in our survey also had the highest interest in receiving the Q-Pan H5N1 vaccine. However, we had few student respondents and those who worked more closely with HPAI viruses may have been Table 3 Reasons for lack of interest or only possible interest in Q-Pan H5N1 vaccine. \n\na Percentages equal to greater than 100% as respondents were able to choose more than one answer. more likely to complete the survey. Although this could introduce response bias, we would expect this same bias to occur across each occupational category. Nearly half of respondents were interested in receiving the Q-Pan H5N1 vaccine and of the remaining, the majority responded that they might be interested but wanted more information. If vaccine were to be offered to laboratory workers, education should be provided about protection provided by the vaccine and its safety profile. The majority of respondents were also interested in receiving vaccines against other HPAI viruses if available and licensed. The most commonly selected reason for a lack of interest in Q-Pan H5N1 vaccine or wanting more information about the vaccine was a belief that the vaccine would not provide further benefit to current biosafety practices. If an A(H5N1) vaccine were to be recommended, it would be used in tandem with current laboratory training and biosafety practices and, in the event of an accident, recommended post-exposure prophylaxis with anti-viral medication [22] [23] [24] [25] .\n\nSafety concerns were also given as a reason for lack of interest in the Q-Pan H5N1 vaccine, and these mostly centered on the adjuvant. Q-Pan H5N1 was the first licensed influenza vaccine with adjuvant in the United States [26] . Adjuvants are used to increase the magnitude and breadth (e.g., production of cross-strain neutralizing antibodies) of the immune response to the vaccine, which is especially important for vaccines containing influenza strains for which little or no prior antibodies are present, such as novel influenza A viruses [27] [28] [29] . During the 2009 influenza pandemic, some AS03-adjuvanted monovalent influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccines were associated with an increased risk of narcolepsy in children and adolescents in some countries [30, 31] , though it is unknown whether this was related to the antigen, the adjuvant, some genetic susceptibility, or a combination of these factors. The acceptable safety profile of Q-Pan H5N1 was demonstrated in several studies prior to licensure and is comparable with seasonal influenza vaccines, though larger sample sizes are needed to assess for rare adverse events such as narcolepsy [29, 32, 33] . Furthermore, the ASO3 adjuvant used in Q-Pan H5N1 has been shown to have a better immune response than the MF59 adjuvant when used in an A (H7N9) vaccine [34] .\n\nAn ideal vaccine candidate would provide at least some level of cross-protection across multiple H5 subtype strains (i.e., heterologous protection). Development of neutralizing antibodies against other clades was seen in some participants of Q-Pan H5N1 immunogenicity trials [35, 36] . Adjuvanted A(H5N1) vaccines have been found to prevent mortality from heterologous strains in mice models [37] and some studies have found cross-reacting antibodies in humans after a booster with a heterologous vaccine (for example, receiving a first dose of an influenza A/Vietnam/04 vaccine followed by a booster dose of an A/Indonesia/05 vaccine resulting in antibody development to multiple strains) [38] . However, Q-Pan H5N1 vaccine would be offered with the main intent to protect primarily against the A/Indonesia/05 strain.\n\nThe risk of laboratory-acquired influenza A(H5N1) virus infection is likely extremely low. A review of reported select agent laboratory-acquired infections reported to CDC between 2004 and 2010 identified a total of 11, giving an estimated rate of 1.57 per 10,000 laboratory worker-years in the United States [20] . There have been no cases of laboratory-acquired HPAI virus infections reported to date; however, the risk of laboratory-acquired infection is not zero and A(H5N1) virus remains a moderate pandemic threat [10] . In addition to laboratory workers, avian influenza outbreak responders are also at increased risk of occupational exposure. There have been several serosurveys among poultry workers in Asia responding to A(H5N1) virus outbreaks in poultry, all of which have demonstrated low levels of seropositivity [39] [40] [41] . Vaccination may provide a safe addition to current biosafety practices for the relatively small population at increased risk of occupational exposure. Based on estimates presented to ACIP, approximately 6000 doses would be needed to provide 2 doses to an estimated 2500 laboratory personnel and 500 public health responders in the United States [18] .\n\nOur survey has several limitations. The estimated response rate was low and our findings may not be representative of U.S. laboratory personnel working with HPAI viruses. In addition, our survey results may not be generalizable to other occupations with potential occupational exposure to HPAI viruses (e.g., avian influenza outbreak responders). We also had difficulties assessing accurately the time spent working with HPAI or A(H5N1) viruses. Estimates were based on respondents' reported typical work schedules, which may vary in time spent in the BSL-3E area working with HPAI. Individuals who work more with HPAI or influenza A (H5N1) viruses may have been more likely to respond to the survey introducing response bias. Finally, the survey was designed to collect information relevant for vaccination policy in the United States and distributed to laboratories registered with the USDA, so the results may not be generalizable to the broader global community.\n\nThe majority of respondents were interested in or wanted more information about the Q-Pan H5N1 vaccine. HPAI vaccination of laboratory workers at risk of occupational exposure could be used along with existing biosafety practices to protect this population. If other HPAI vaccines are available and licensed, further research will be needed to determine which, if any, should be offered to HPAI laboratory workers during the inter-pandemic period."}
