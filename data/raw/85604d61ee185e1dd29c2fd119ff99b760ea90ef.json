{"title": "", "body": "Feline Infectious Peritonitis l'rrliminaq ultrastructural and filtration studies have shown that feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is probably caused b\\-a virus although the virus could not be grown in tissue culture (1, 2) . Despite the fact that Hardy et al. (S) demonstrated that a feline leulwmia virus antigen was present in 5 of 13 cats with spontaneous I;II' and feline leukemia virus was found in electron micrographs from tissues of 1 of the 5 cats, in our study of various tissues from 25 cats with experimentally induced FIP, morphological forms of feline leukemia virus, as described by various workers (h-6), have never been seen. This paper reports the morphogenesis of :I virus as detected in tissues from 12 of the 25 cats with experimental P'II'.\n\nThe original source of the infectious material has been described (7) . The 12 cats were killed 011 postinoculation days 3 to 19 (Table 1) . They had been inoculated subcutaneously or intraperitoneally with bacteriologically sterile saline suspensions of kidney-, liver-, or omentum-containing lesions of FII'. JIethods for the preparation of b&sues for electron microscopic examination have been described (8) . Thin sections were examined in a Philips EAI-200, AEI EA[ GB, or RCA EALU-SG electron microscope. Viral particles were found most commonlu\\ in cells identified a macrophages in typical lesions of E'IP in the omentum, spleen, liver, and subcutaneous site of inoculation.\n\nIt. could not be ascertained whether these macrophages originated from mesothelium, reticulum cells, blood monocytes, or tissue hist,iocytes. The impression was that t,he> had originated from each of these sources. Viral particles were found in varving numbers in different cells. Cells containing viral particles were e:wily found in some sections, in others an extensive srarch was necessary.\n\nThese cells were always in areas adjacent to the necrotizing lesions of FII'.\n\nMost commonly, viral particles were usually seen in the Golgi area in vesicles and smooth-surfaced cysternae (Figs. 1, 2) . Occasionally, phagosomes contained viral particles, sometimes in large numbers (Fig.  5 ). Extracellular particles were detected rarely. Occasionally, the virus was sew budding from smooth-surfaced vesicles or cysternae (Fig. 4) . Budding from the plasma membrane was never detected. Double buds were rarely seen (Fig. 4b) . Viral particles usually measured 70 to SO rnK in diameter alt.hough some larger forms I\\-ere seen (Figs. 2, 3) . Most particles contained a donut-shaped nucleoid, 50 to 55 rnp in diameter, with a central lucent area of 20 to 30 rnp in diameter. The nucleoid n-as surrounded by a trilaminar unit membrane (Figs. 2, 3, 4) . Other forms of viral particles, Liver, spleen which appeared to be degenerating forms, were frequently seen, especially in cysternae and phagosomes. Their nucleoid took various forms from solid spheres to crescent.ic shapes, and their unit membranes were intact or appeared as ingle slines (Figs. 2, 5) . Club-shaped projections were occasionally seen associated with viral particles (Figs. 3,  4b) . No other viruses or microorganisms could be identified in electron micrographs of the 25 cats studied, except for the viral particles described above.\n\nThe morphogenesis and morphology in thin sections of the virus reported above is similar to that of the human coronavirus 224-E and mouse hepatitis virus (9, 11) . If the club-shaped projections noted in some electron micrographs of the virus reported above are, indeed, viral structures, a further similarity to coronaviruses is evident (10).\n\nThough similarities to feline leukemia virus (FLV) are apparent, the virus in cats with experimental FIP appears somewhat different in electron micrographs because: (a) FLV is larger in size. This consistent difference in average size has been demonstrated using the same electron microscope and identical techniques in one laboratory ( "}
