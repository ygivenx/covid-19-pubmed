{"title": "", "body": "3 years after the fi rst identifi ed case of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, no specifi c treatment with proven eff ectiveness exists. More than 1600 people infected with the virus from 26 countries have been reported to WHO, including more than 600 related deaths. 1 As a result of a large hospital outbreak at King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, 2 between August and September, 2015, the Saudi Arabian Ministry of National Guard Health Aff airs organised a 2 day research initiative workshop on Sept 9-10, 2015, to make recommendations for therapeutic (panel 1) and non-therapeutic (panel 2) research on MERS-CoV. Recognising the crucial role of scientifi c and political partnerships, the Ministry of National Guard Health Aff airs invited key representatives of regional and international health agencies and experts in basic and translational science, diagnostics, therapeutics, epidemiology, infection prevention and control, clinical research, and public health. Several pharmaceutical companies presented the status of MERS-CoV treatment candidates in development. Primary objectives were to exchange knowledge and prioritise potential treatments for assessment in clinical trials in Saudi Arabia.\n\nPromising treatments discussed at the meeting included immunotherapy with MERS-CoV-specifi c antibodies (convalescent plasma, monoclonal, or polyclonal antibodies) in addition to several new and repurposed small molecule drugs. All of these candidates will need to be assessed in phased clinical trials after demonstration of\n\n\u2022 Although much fundamental preclinical study has been done, further assessment of the most promising drugs with appropriate animal models is the optimum next step before clinical trials are started \u2022 These preclinical studies should begin immediately, with clinical studies beginning soon after \u2022 In view of the episodic nature of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections in human beings and generally low numbers of cases at hospitals or health-care systems, international collaboration among scientists, clinicians, hospitals, extra-hospital health sectors, regulators, and funders is key for effi cient and eff ective implementation of these clinical trials \u2022 An effi cient stepwise approach to the generation of scientifi cally valid clinical research has to drive and inform eventual incorporation of new treatments into clinical practice \u2022 Relevant parties should continually assess progress, including a multisectoral follow-up meeting to incorporate the most advanced data to better inform the care of patients with MERS-CoV \u2022 Standardised case report forms should be developed to accommodate observational studies and clinical trials, with tiered data collection requirements that refl ect the varying capacity for research across diff erent environments and the standard defi nitions of variables that allow data to be combined across multiple studies or trials. 3, 4 These forms will help to create integrated databases that include epidemiological, microbiological, immunological, and clinical data; specimen repositories; and storage banks to inform subsequent MERS-CoV scientifi c inquiry\n\n\u2022 With an understanding of the risks associated with development of a new treatment, researchers should use a portfolio approach to assess multiple complementary approaches and should prioritise the approaches that are most advanced in the scientifi c and development process for fi rst assessment. \u2022 A therapeutics research infrastructure should consider an adaptive clinical trial design that allows either effi cient sequential or parallel assessment of treatments, in comparison with a concurrent control group-ideally taking the form of an allocation-concealed, randomised, blinded (to the intervention) clinical trial \u2022 Outcomes and endpoints for clinical trials should be realistic. Although demonstration of a reduction in mortality is the ideal goal of any treatment-based clinical trial, the ability to validly show a mortality reduction can be hampered by the likelihood that an absolute mortality reduction greater than 5-10% is, historically, unlikely for many interventions and especially so when used after an infection has caused severe illness and organ dysfunction, and by the likely infeasibility for studies to enrol the thousands of patients necessary to show a less than 10% absolute reduction in mortality. Therefore, although measuring mortality is essential, trials should consider other important endpoints, including biological markers of eff ect (eg, viral load in biological samples), especially for early phase clinical assessments safety and anti-MERS-CoV effi cacy in appropriate animal models. At present, none of these treatment candidates have suffi cient clinical data to support their use in clinical care. Because this knowledge base is evolving dynamically, new evidence should be continually reassessed."}
