A new SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been identified as the etiological agent of the disease. Its seriousness lies in rapid transmission and high fatality (around 15%). However, the origin of SARS-CoV is still unknown, and no effective drug or vaccine is available up to now.\n\nThe SARS-CoV replicase encodes two overlapping polyproteins, pp1a and pp1b, which mediate viral replication and transcription. While a special main proteinase, 3C-like proteinase, is responsible for the cleavage of polyproteins, its functional importance make it an attractive target for drug development. Fortunately, the crystal structures of SARS-CoV main proteinase has been determined, 1;2 which adopt a serine-protease fold and is homologous to the main proteinases from human coronavirus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus. 3 The goal of this study is to find potential inhibitors and locate the ligand-binding sites in SARS-CoV main proteinase based on comparison of nonhomologous tertiary structures, hence to provide clues to rational drug design.\n\nThe atomic coordinates of SARS-CoV main proteinase were downloaded from Protein Data Bank (ID 1Q2W). NCI program 4 was used to identify noncanonical interactions. VAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ Structure/VAST/vastsearch.html) and DALI (http:// www.ebi.ac. uk/dali/) programs were used to find similar structure patterns and in the main proteinase structure of SARS-CoV. The structure alignment was done by CE 5 and the structural comparison was performed by LGA. 6 The constituents of the binding pocket are determined by those residues that have at least one heavy atom (other than hydrogen) with a distance less than 5\n\nA from a heavy atom of inhibitor, as did in Chou et al. 7 The visualization of 3D structure was generated Keywords: SARS-CoV; Main proteinase; Noncanonical interactions; Inhibitor; Binding. by PROTEINEXPLORER (http://www.proteinexplorer.org).\n\nThe noncanonical interactions in SARS-CoV main proteinase structures are shown in Figure 1 . There are two pairs of main chain-side chain interactions: Glu288 (donor) and Trp 207 (acceptor), Ile152 (donor) and Phe8 (acceptor). There are four pairs of side chain-side chain interactions: Arg40 (donor) and Tyr54 (acceptor), Arg298 (donor) and Phe8 (acceptor), Pro184 (donor) and Phe185 (acceptor), and Tyr126 (donor) and Phe140 (acceptor). These residues are marked as \u00d4@\u00d5 in Figure 2 .\n\nAmong these interactions, Phe8 accepts two N-H\u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1 p bonds in a sandwich fashion, one donated by a side-side chain Arg298, and one donated by a main-side chian Ile152, as existed in human rac1. 8 Taken together with another N-H\u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1 p interaction between Glu288 and Trp207, these noncanonical bindings connected N-terminus and C-terminus of the enzyme together, then fixed to Ile152 (domain II) and Trp207 (domain III), this makes the domain II and III not flexible due to the loop formed by above interactions in the right and a loop already existed in the left (Fig. 1A) , that is stabilizes the structure of the protease. Furthermore, we turn to examine the remaining three pairs of interactions: Arg40 and Tyr54, Pro184 and Phe185, and Tyr126 and Phe140. It can be seen from Figure 1B that these noncanonical bindings will be able to stabilize the protein structure around the active center formed by Cys-His catalytic dyad (Cys145 and His41). On the other hand, after binding, the small helix Arg40 and His41 locate will expect to move up, the loop Phe140 and Cys145 locate and the loop Pro184 and Phe185 locate will expect to move down, hence make the active center more open for substrate binding (Fig. 1B) . These results can be used for rational design of mutagenesis experiments and analysis of conservation of interactions at functional sites. In recent years, the noncanonical interactions have been shown to be important for the stability of protein structure 9-11 and ligand recognition. 12 The structurally similar nonhomologous virus proteins identified by VAST and DALI methods focus on 6 proteases: 1CQQ (Rhinovirus 3c Protease With Ag7088 Inhibitor), 1L1N (Poliovirus 3c Proteinase), 1MBM (Nsp4 Proteinase From Equine Arteritis Virus), 1DY8 (Hepatitis C Virus Ns3 Protease with inhibitor FKI), 1QA7 (Hepatitis A Virus 3c Protease with inhibitor NFA) and 1DF9 (Dengue Virus Ns3-Protease Complexed With Mung-Bean Bowman-Birk Inhibitor). The structure-based sequence alignment of the above six proteases with SARS-CoV main protease is shown in Figure 2 . The results demonstrate that a number of similar beta sheets (marked by b) exist. In particular, there are three similar structural patterns showing conservative residues (bold representation). The catalytical important residues are included in the first two highly conservative patterns: His-Cys or His-Ser catalytic dyads. 2;13-18 In the third pattern, Gly is conservative in 6 proteases except SARS-CoV main proteinase, the significance of mutation from Gly161 to Tyr161 in SARS is unclear. Anyway, the three structural patterns form the common active center of these seven enzymes, as seen in their superpositions (Fig. 3 ).\n\nSince these nonhomologous virus proteases share the same active center, we can consider the possibility of applying the inhibitors from these enzymes to SARS-CoV main proteinase. In fact, Anand et al. 3 has indicated that the inhibitor AG7088 may be modified to make it useful for SARS therapy. Chou et al. 7 conducted the docking studies of KZ7088 (a derivative of AG7088) to the SARS-CoV main proteinase (based on a theoretical model). Here, we studied the possibility of other inhibitors in anti-SARS drug development. Figure 4 shows the structures of docking other inhibitors from HAV, HCV and Dengue virus to SARS-CoV main proteinase, the residues that make contact with these inhibitors are marked as \u00d4#\u00d5 in Figure 2 . Furthermore, the corresponding binding pockets are shown in Table 1 . The results reveal that these inhibitors can bind to SARS-CoV main proteinase well.\n\nThus, the results above suggest that there is a link of SARS-CoV to human rhinovirus, Poliovirus, Arteritis virus, HAV, HCV, and Dengue virus. The inhibitors from these viruses could be modified to make them useful for SARS therapy. In fact, Cinatl et al. 19 reported that human interferons, a medicine widely used in HCV patients, was useful for the treatment of SARS. Anyway, whether relationships between SARS-CoV and these pathogens exist or not, the present results provide a wide clue to search for anti-SARS inhibitors. The residues marked as \u00d4b\u00d5 indicate similar beta-sheets. The bold residues indicate structurally similar patterns. The residues marked as \u00d4@\u00d5 make noncanonical interactions. The residues marked as \u00d4#\u00d5 make contact with inhibitors."}
