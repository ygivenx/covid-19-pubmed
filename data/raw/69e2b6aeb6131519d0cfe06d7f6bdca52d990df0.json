{"title": "Contribution of molecular biology to the study of the porcine interferon system*", "body": "Many in vivo experiments in laboratory animals have shown that interferons (IFNs) are implicated in viral and other infectious disease pathogenesis and recovery (Stewart, 1979) . The fact that the effect of endogenous and exogenous IFN in experimentally induced viral diseases is very often beneficial led to the idea that IFNs can be considered as natural non-specific antiviral agents (Toy, 1983 ) . These facts, with the recent advent of recombinant DNA technology, have prompted the use of IFNs as new anti-infectious agents with a broad antiviral spectrum and immunomodulatory properties in man (Oldham, 1985 ) and more recently in domestic animals, as demonstrated by several groups in the bovine species (Babiuk et al., 1985; Schwers et al., 1985; Werenne et al., 1985; Bielefeldt-Ohmann et al., 1987 ) .\n\nIn addition, several teams of reproductive physiologists have recently shown that a protein named Trophoblastin or OTP-1 (for Trophoblast Protein 1 ), expressed at a high level in utero during the early stages of pregnancy by the trophectoderm of the preimplantation embryo in sheep, has antiviral activity and is an authentic IFN-o~ (Imakawa et al., 1987; Charpigny et al., 1988) . Several experimental data suggest that this protein might be a signal for the maternal recognition of pregnancy by prolonging the lifespan of the corpus luteum in the ovary (Bazer et al., 1986; Vallet et al., 1988 ). An immunomodulatory effect contributing to maintenance of the fetal allograft is also possible.\n\nThese pathogenic and physiological aspects of the IFN system can be developed in the porcine species. First, previous work in our laboratory showed that, during the experimental infection of newborn piglets by the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (which induces acute and often fatal diarrhoea), high levels of IFN-c~ were produced early after infection in the intestinal tract, lungs, serum and urine, before the onset of clinical signs (La Bonnardi6re and Laude, 1981 ) . We believed that it could be of great interest to investigate the pathogenetic significance of this IFN-o~ response using cloned recombinant IFN-o~ subspecies and monoclonal antibodies. Recombinant IFN-c~ could also represent a new therapeutic and/or prophylactic agent against infectious disease in this species.\n\nSecond, we have detected in the uterine flushings of pregnant sows, during the implantation period (between the 12th and 20th day of pregnancy) the presence of an IFN-like antiviral activity (maximum 9000 IU/ml at day 16 ) which could be, as reported for ruminants, an IFN-o~ (La Bonnardi~re, unpublished results) . Molecular characterization of this IFN, cloning of the genes encoding it and evaluation of its biological importance for the maintenance of pregnancy could be of interest in a species in which prolificacy is an important economic factor.\n\nFor these reasons, we have undertaken the molecular cloning of porcine IFN-a genes and the subsequent production of an E. coli-derived recombinant porcine IFN-ce.\n\nIn the human, bovine, equine and probably ovine species, the INF-a multigene family is divided into two related but distinct subfamilies referred as class I and class II (Capon et al., 1985; Hauptmann and Swetly, 1985; Velan et al., 1985; Himmler et al., 1986) . Both families contain virus inducible genes, but in ruminants class II members appear to be specifically expressed by the trophoblastic part of the embryo before implantation in the uterus (Imakawa et al., 1987; Imakawa et al., 1989; Charlier et al., 1989) .\n\nWe have also characterized these two subfamilies in the porcine genome ( Fig. 1 ). Using a human class I IFN-a probe, we isolated from a porcine library nine distinct clones containing 10 porcine IFN-a loci (Fig. 2 ) among which three were sequenced and denoted PoIFN-a 1, PoIFN-a2 and g/PoIFN-ai~l (Lef6vre and La Bonnardi6re, 1986 ). PoIFN-a 1 and PoIFN-a2 are intronless, potentially functional, virus inducible, class I IFN-a genes that can encode 189 and 181 AA long preproteins respectively with a putative signal peptide of 23 AA so that the mature proteins are probably 166 (a 1 ) and 158 (a2) AA long. An N-glycosylation site is present at position 78-80 only in IFN-a 1 mature protein (not in a2 ). Sequence homologies of these two genes to human IFN-al gene is 78.5% for nucleotides and 64% for AA.\n\nSequence analysis of the third locus ~,PoIFN-a. 1 suggested that it was a class II IFN-a pseudogene which had evolved from an ancestral gene encoding, like previously described mammalian class II IFN-a genes, a 172 AA preprotein with a putative signal peptide of 23 AA. Several deletions and insertions occurred in its sequence so that it cannot encode a functional polypeptide. In order to isolate potentially functional class II genes, ~uPoIFN-aH 1 was used as a probe to screen another porcine genomic library. Six genomic clones were isolated containing five new porcine IFN-aH loci for which sequencing is in progress (Fig. 2 ) .\n\nAlthough the actual size of the porcine IFN-a multigene family is not yet known, we can estimate that class I subfamily contains at least 11 loci among which nine are cloned and two (potentially functional) sequenced. This subfamily was localized by in situ hybridization on the long arm of chromosome no. 1 (Yerle et al., 1986) . Class II subfamily contains at least seven loci among which six have been cloned and one pseudogene sequenced. As ~tPolFN-otII 1 is linked to a class I locus (Fig. 2 ) , class II loci are probably also located on chromosome no. 1. The nine upper clones (21 to 223) were isolated using a human IFN-a 1 probe (Mantel et al., 1980) and the six lower clones (2n23 to 2nl 1 ) were isolated using the porcine ~uPolFN-anl probe. Boxes indicate regions of maximal length containing an IFN-a loci as determined by Southern blot analysis. Class I and class II loci are represented by black and grey boxes respectively. Arrows indicate the position and direction of transcription of sequenced genes. Note that some clones contain two distinct loci. Clones 217 and 228 contain a class I locus and a class II locus (~uPolFN-aH 1 ) which is also present in clone ~'TI 10 (in the opposite orientation ). We chose to express PolFN-al gene in E. coli because it was previously shown to encode a protein with IFN-a antiviral activity (Lef6vre and La Bonnardi6re, 1986 ) . The gene introduced in E. coli plasmidic expression vectors was modified by delection of its signal peptide coding sequence in order to obtain intracellular synthesis of mature IFN-al (methionyl IFN-al, MetIFN-a 1: the 166 AA mature protein with an additional N-terminal methionine). Construction of the vectors, using standard recombinant DNA techniques, will be described elsewhere. We designed an expression vector (Fig. 3 ) allowing transcription, from the lambda bacteriophage PR thermoinducible promotor, of a bicistronic mRNA in which the cristron encoding MetIFN-a 1 was preceded by a short cistron encoding a very efficiently translated protein. To obtain a very efficient reinitiation of translation of the MetIFN-a 1 cistron, the two cistrons were placed in a translational coupling configuration allowing their consecutive translation by the same bacterial ribosome: stop and start codons were placed so that the reading frames of the two cistrons slightly overlapped in different phases (Oppenheim and Yanofsky, 1980; Gold, 1988 ). An efficient Shine and Dalgarno (SD) sequence had to be placed in the 3' end of the first cistron to allow translation initiation of the second cistron. SD sequence (see Gold, 1988 ) is a short sequence showing complementarity to the 3' end of the E. coli 16 S ribosomal RNA and essential for translation initiation of a cistron located a few nucleotides downstream. However, as it was impossible to identify a priori the best fitted SD sequence allowing efficient translation of a given cistron, we chose to insert in vitro in the 3' end of the upstream cistron a random synthetic sequence (7successive base pairs) instead of a given SD sequence. After E. coli transformation, clones expressing high amounts of MetIFN-a 1 were selected by a semiquantitative immunodetection technique allowing rapid screening of a large number of clones (Fig. 3) : ampicillin resistant clones were plated at high density, replicated on nitrocellulose filters and induced at 42 \u00b0C for PR dependent expression. Immunodetection of the recombinant protein was performed on in situ lysed colonies using an anti-porcine IFN-a 1 monoclonal antibody and bound antibody was revealed with 35S labeled protein A. The intensity of the autoradiographic spots was used to identify clones producing high amounts of recombinant protein.\n\nUsing this method, a clone (pRND2D-231 ) was obtained producing after thermoinduction large amounts of 18 000 Da protein with antiviral activity (400 000 IU/ml of bacterial culture) corresponding to MetIFN-a 1. The selected sequence present in pRND2D-231 was shown to contain the 5'-GGAG-3' tetranucleotide which is reminiscent of a Shine and Dalgarno sequence (Fig. 3) . Making the expression of MetIFN-al constitutive (by deleting the thermosensitive repressor gene d857 in pRND2D-231 ) increased IFN production at least three times. Monoclonal antibodies were obtained against this rlFN-a and used to purify it to homogeneity from bacterial lysate by immunoaffinity (Fig. 4) . Its specific activity was estimated to 5-10 \u00d7 107 IU/mg protein. The properties of the recombinant molecule were investigated in vitro and in vivo, by comparison, whenever possible, with influenza virus induced leucocyte IFN (LeuIFN).\n\nIn tissue culture Antiviral effect. We compared the antiviral spectrum of both kinds of porcine IFN's on a panel of 5 cell lines belonging to four different species (Table 1 ) . It appeared that, like LeuIFN. rIFN-o~ exhibits a broad spectrum of antiviral activity ( 10% activity on mouse cells as compared to MDBK cells). But interestingly, rlFN-a I was six times more active than its natural counterpart on homologous, porcine ceils. This suggests that IFN-o~ 1 is not a major component, if any, of the virus-induced LeulFN.\n\nCytocidal effect. We previously showed that IFNs from several species exerted a direct toxic effect on primary cultures of pig kidney epithelial cells (Laude and La Bonnardi6re, 1984) . We assayed rIFN-al on these cells and found that it induced the same kind of cytocidal effect, but with less efficiency: I 0 times more antiviral units were needed to induce cell death, than with LeuIFN (unpublished results). This result suggests the existence of two different pathways for antiviral/cytocidal effects.\n\nAntigenicity. Different authors have shown a high antigenic homology between human and porcine IFN-o~ (Soloviev et al., 1982; La Bonnardi6re et al., 1986; Piasecki, 1988) . It was of interest to verify if rlFN-cel was similar to LeulFN in this respect. Anti-Human IFN-a sheep globulins neutralized both species of porcine IFN to the same extent (Table 2) . Recent results obtained with monoclonal antibodies directed to rlFN-a 1 confirm this close antigenic similarity between the cloned species and the natural IFN. We concluded that rlFN-a 1 should represent a good substitute of natural IFN for subsequent in vivo studies. Whether due to its unique primary AA sequence or to the absence of N-glycosylation, rlFN-a 1 is indeed more efficient than LeulFN at triggering an antiviral state in porcine cells.\n\nIn order to evaluate some important pharmacological properties of rlFNa 1, two series of experiments were conducted in non-infected pigs. It was not possible to compare rlFN-a 1 with LeulFN, as the latter was not available in sufficient quantity and purity.\n\nIn newborn pigs, doses of 1 \u00d7 106 units of rlFN-a 1 were given intramuscularly (i.m.) and temperature and weight gain were measured for each animal; some pharmacological data were also recorded and calculated. In summary the rlFN-a 1 did not lead to any weight loss in 5-day-old piglets, including those which received five doses of 106 units. In two experiments, no significant hyperthermia was noted. The main pharmacokinetic parameters, measured in the blood after i.m. injection, were as follows: time of maximum concentration (Tmax) < 1 h, maximum serum concentration (Cma x ) = 1700 IU/ml, apparent elimination half-life (T1/e ) = 210 ___ 40 min., measured between 9 and 24 h (Fig. 5B) . The same results hold true for one day-old piglets. Therefore we concluded that rlFN-a 1 exert no detectable toxic effect in the newborn. This is important if treatment or prevention of neonatal viral infections is contemplated using this recombinant molecule. Four adult Large White pigs weighing on average 80 kg, were injected i.m. with the same preparation of purified rIFN-c~l. Two received 10 6 IU/kg of eight, two received 5 X 105 IU/kg. The kinetics of antiviral activity was followed in the blood after aortic puncture ( Figure 5A ). There were two differences from the results with newborn animals: first, whereas the parameters Cma~ and Tmax were roughly identical for the young and the adults, elimination half-life was higher in the adults: apparent T~/2 = 280, and 470 +_ 90 min respectively for the doses of 106 and 2 \u00d7 105 IU, in the time-interval of 8 h to 24 h after injection. Second, there was a significant hyperthermia observed in the two individuals given the highest dose, followed at 32 h by a significant hypothermia. This transient fever, also recognized in human patients administered high IFN dosage, was not observed with the lower dose. The pigs, when observed for several weeks afterwards, did not show any problems. CONCLUSIONS This work illustrates a possible contribution of molecular biology to the study of the structure, biological and pathogenetic role of cytokines in domestic animals, and to their potential use as anti-infectious agents.\n\nWe have shown that the porcine IFN-ce multigene family contained, like several other mammalian species, class I and class II subfamilies of intronless genes encoding several IFN-ot subspecies.\n\nOne of the class I subspecies was expressed at high 1 vels in E. coli and several neutralizing and non-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies were obtained against this molecule allowing its purification to homogeneity. The in vivo preliminary data we obtained will be used to test the effect of rlFN-a 1 on the outcome of experimental viral disease of the pig. Particular attention will be paid to those diseases occurring at critical periods in the pig's lifetime.\n\nWe are now trying and characterize the physicochemical and biological properties of the IFN-like antiviral activity detected in uterine flushings at the time of implantation. Hybridization analysis of mRNA from porcine embryos will soon reveal if this IFN-like antiviral activity is a class II IFN-a gene product like the previously described ruminant embryonic IFNs."}
