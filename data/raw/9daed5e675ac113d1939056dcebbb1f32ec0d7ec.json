{"title": "Functional assessment of cell entry and receptor usage for lineage B \u03b2- coronaviruses, including 2019-nCoV", "body": "Every year, additional novel CoV sequences are discovered. However, there is a massive knowledge gap in the field as very little work is performed after the viral sequences are published. Therefore, it is unknown whether these novel viruses have the potential to emerge in human populations.\n\nCurrent methods for studying novel \u03b2-CoVs are technically demanding. Viral isolation from field samples is rarely successful and reverse genetics recovery of recombinant virus is labor-intensive, and expensive as synthesis of a single genome can cost upwards of $15,000. These limitations are prohibitive to studying novel CoVs at the scale in which they are discovered.\n\nCell entry is an essential component of cross-species transmission, especially for the \u03b2-CoVs. All CoVs encode a surface glycoprotein, spike, which binds to the host-cell author/funder. All rights reserved.

For \u03b2-CoVs, a single region of the spike protein called the receptor binding domain (RBD) mediates the interaction with the host cell receptor.\n\nAfter binding the receptor, a nearby host protease cleaves the spike, which releases the spike fusion peptide, facilitating virus entry [9] [10] [11] [12] . Known host receptors for \u03b2-CoVs include angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS-CoV and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for MERS-CoV 13, 14 .\n\nStructural studies of coronaviruses have shown that the spike RBD is capable of folding independently from the rest of the spike protein and contains all of the structural information for host receptor binding 15 . Additionally, a previous study showed that replacing the RBD of the lineage B bat virus, Rp3, allowed the virus to enter cells expressing human ACE2 (hACE2) 16 . We therefore developed a method to functionally test the RBDs from novel lineage B \u03b2-CoVs in place of the SARS-CoV spike RBD ( figure   1 ). Synthesizing just the RBD of spike is much faster and cost-effective than conventional pseudotyping methods that rely on synthesis of the full ~4kb spike sequence for novel CoVs: a process that can take weeks and is cost-prohibitive for large panels of spike sequences. The short turnaround time for our approach allowed us to test the receptor usage of all published, unique RBD sequences in lineage B, and also rapidly confirm the ACE2 receptor usage of the 2019-nCoV spike, which emerged in China in January 2020 as our study was ongoing.\n\nWe show that lineage B RBDs divide into functionally distinct clades and that several previously-unappreciated viruses exhibit compatibility with an unknown receptor on human cells. We also show that these clades are capable of recombining to impart human host-cell entry phenotypes, and that, beyond the RDB-receptor interaction, host author/funder. All rights reserved.

Previous studies have shown that absence of the host protease or incompatibility between the host protease and viral spike can block viral entry [21] [22] [23] [24] . To circumvent host-cell protease incompatibility or absence, we . Surprisingly, exogenous protease enhanced entry of a subset of clade 2 spike chimeras in nonhuman primate, bat and human cells (figure 2). Importantly, VSV-g pseudotyped particles were able to produce luciferase signal in all cell lines tested in this study (supp. fig. 2c ).\n\nWe next tested human variants of known \u03b2-CoV receptors for their ability to mediate cell entry of clade 2 and 3 spike chimeras.

Only clade 1 RBDs contain all 14 residues that have been shown through crystallography, to interact with human ACE2 (figure 4a; s4). The majority of these residues are absent from clades 2 and 3, which contain additional deletions in surface exposed loops that cluster at the interface with ACE2 ( figure 4 a, b) .\n\nWe generated a series of clade consensus RBD variants to determine the minimum number of mutations needed to impart ACE2 function on clade 2 and 3 RBDs (figure 4c).\n\nIntroducing the two loop deletions from clade 1 in clade 2 results in a reduced spike expression, impaired pseudotype incorporation and loss of cell entry ( figure 4c, d) .\n\nauthor/funder.

Introducing all 14 ACE2 contact points in clade 2 or 3 also failed to restore ACE2 entry (figure 4c; 2\u21921 and 3\u21921 version 2). Only replacing all 14 contact points and the surrounding amino acids (also known as the receptor binding motif, RBM) lead to increased ACE2 entry with clade 2 and 3 RBDs (figure 4c; 2\u21921 version 3 = clade 2 residues 322-400 + clade 1 residues 400-501; 3\u21921 version 3 = clade 3 residues 322-385 + clade 1 residues 386-501). Taken together, these results show that the entire RBM from clade 1 is needed for ACE2 entry.\n\nWe next synthesized full-length clade 2 and 3 spikes to compare to our RBD chimeras. We selected the clade 2 spike, As6526, because it consistently gave strong entry signal in human cells following protease-treatment (figure 2b) as well as BM48-31, the only clade 3 spike in our panel. As we did for SARS-CoV spike, clade 2 and 3 spikes were codon optimized, FLAG-tagged and silent mutations were introduced to facilitate replacing their RBD with the consensus RBD from clade 1 (figure 5a). All chimeric constructs expressed similarly, with the exception for the SARS-BM48-31 RBD chimera, which exhibited reduced expression and incorporation (figure 5b). Protease treatment enhanced entry of both the As6526 clade 2 RBD chimera and full-length spike entry into Huh cells (figure 5c). Protease treatment had no effect on either the BM48-31 clade 3 chimera or full-length spike (figure 5c). Taken together, these findings show that SARSlineage B RBD chimeras reflect the entry phenotype of full-length lineage B spikes. author/funder. All rights reserved.

We replaced the RBD of full-length clade 2 and 3 spike with the consensus RBD from clade 1 and tested pseudotypes on cells expressing the clade 1 receptor. The clade 1 consensus RBD efficiently facilitated entry of both As6526 and BM48-31 spike only following protease treatment. These findings show that even though BHK-hACE2 cells support full-length clade 1 spike entry, just having the RBD from a clade 1 virus is insufficient to mediate entry. As seen in our previous experiments, protease treatment did not enhance pseudotype entry in the absence of host receptor (figure 5).\n\nauthor/funder. All rights reserved.

To gain traction on this ever-growing problem, we took a reductionist approach to coronavirus entry and developed a scalable, BSL2-compatible method for testing only the minimal region of the virus essential for interacting with the host receptor ( figure 1, figure s1a ).\n\nBecause most of these viruses have never been isolated, we resorted to synthetic biology and molecular engineering to reduce the burden of gene synthesis to just a small fragment. Thus, the cost and synthesis production time for testing several spikes for entry in our system is dramatically reduced (figure s1d). In theory, this approach to functional viromics should be applicable to a wide variety of virus-host proteins and interactions.\n\nCoronavirus entry is a multi-step process involving multiple, distinct domains in spike that mediate virus attachment to the cell surface, receptor engagement, protease processing and membrane fusion 8 . While the RBD:receptor interaction is most studied in this process, recent studies have highlighted the major role host protease processing plays as a species barrier 22, [25] [26] [27] . Lineage C coronaviruses include MERS-CoV as well as distantly related viruses such as HKU4, HKU5 and PDF-2180 28, 29 . Studies have shown that HKU4 can bind human DPP4 but requires addition of exogenous trypsin to facilitate cell entry and that HKU5 and PDF-2180 spikes can enter human cells through an unidentified receptor with protease treatment 22, 26 . Analogous to these earlier studies of lineage C CoVs, we observed protease-enhanced entry of lineage B CoVs (figure 2, 3, 5).

These findings are in strong agreement with previous studies that have either isolated virus (WIV1) or rescued recombinant chimeric viruses (SHC014, Rs4231, Rs7237) 5,7,31 . However, with trypsin, a subset of genetically-similar clade 2 RBDs gained entry in these cells, suggesting their barrier is at the level of protease processing ( figure 2a, b) . The other spike from clade 2 and 3 did not enter the cells we tested, regardless of protease addition, suggesting an absent or incompatible receptor. Surprisingly, the protease-dependent entry phenotype was consistent in the reverse spike chimeras in which we replaced the RBD in clade 2 or 3 spike with a clade 1 RBD (figure 5d), suggesting that either the protease site between S1/S2 is not compatible with the chimeric spike backbone or the protease is not expressed in these cells (figure s5). Because clade 1 spikes enter cells expressing human ACE2 without addition of protease but clade2-clade1 chimeras require protease, our data suggests the spike protease cleavage site is adapted to the protease environment of the receptor-bound RBD (figure s5). author/funder.

Surprisingly, AJi cells were selectively permissive for only clade 2 entry following protease treatment, which suggests that clade 2 RBDs interact with a receptor that is distinct from clade 1 (figure 2c).\n\nOur results show that, despite all being classified as the same virus species, most lineage B \u03b2-CoVs do not use currently known coronavirus receptors ( figure 1e, 3a, b) .\n\nCritically, we did not observe any pseudotype entry in the presence of protease and absence of receptor, suggesting that lineage B cell entry is still receptor-dependent following protease treatment (figure 3b). While our study was ongoing, a novel lineage B \u03b2-CoV was identified as the etiological agent behind an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei, China (2019-nCoV). The RBD for 2019-nCoV has residues and motifs found in all 3 clades but forms a distinct clade, so we tested it for receptor usage and observed entry only with human ACE2 but not other known coronavirus receptors (figure 3d).\n\nInterestingly, within the backbone of SARS-CoV spike, cell entry of 2019-nCoV was similar to the other clade 1 spikes tested, including SARS-CoV. These finding suggests 2019-nCoV is capable of using human ACE2 as efficiently as SARS-CoV, which may help explain the human-to-human transmissibility of this virus. More studies are needed with the full spike sequence and, ideally, a viral isolate.\n\nThe receptor binding motif (RBM) is a small region in the C-terminal half of the RBD and contains all the residues that interface with the host receptor (figure 3a) 15 . The 14 contact points in the co-structure of the SARS-RBD bound to human ACE2 are largely absent from clade 2 and 3 RBDs, which also contain deletions compared to clade 1 RBMs ( figure 4a, b, s4a) .

This is likely because the noncontact residues in the RBM play a supportive and structural role for these contact points, and indeed, these non-contact residues are different between the clades (figure s4).\n\nIn contrast to changing individual amino acids, our chimeric RBD constructs show that clade 2 and 3 RBD containing the clade 1 RBM are compatible with human ACE2.\n\nCoronaviruses frequently undergo recombination, gaining large swaths of genetic material at once 34, 35 . Taken together with our data, it is possible that recombination with a clade 1 virus will impart compatibility with human ACE2. Interestingly, the 2019-nCoV RBD forms a clade that is distinct from the other 3 clades (figure s1c). However, the 2019-nCoV RBD contains most of the contact points with human ACE2 that are found in clade 1 as well as some amino acid variations that are unique to clade 2 and 3 (figure s4b).\n\nTaken together with our receptor assay results, it may be possible that 2019-nCoV arose from recombination between clade 1 and the other clades.\n\nAs we saw with the SARS-As6526 RBD (clade 2) spike chimera, full length As6526 spike entered cells following protease treatment, but BM48-31 (clade 3) spike did not (figure 2, 5c). These data show that the chimeric spikes generally reproduce the entry phenotypes of full-length spikes. Notably, the full length As6526 spike did not enter cells as efficiently as the SARS-As6526 chimera, suggesting that other human-cell adaptations are likely needed in As6526 spike.\n\nThe capacity to predict the zoonotic potential of newly detected viruses has been severely hindered by a lack of functional data for these novel animal virus sequences.\n\nHere, we have developed a rapid and cost-effective platform to functionally test large groups of related viruses for zoonotic potential.
