{"title": "Remote control of neural function by X-ray-induced scintillation", "body": "We first sought opsins that could be effectively activated by the PL of Ce:GAGG. DNA plasmids encoding different opsins were transfected into HEK 293 cells and photocurrents induced by PL illumination were measured (Fig. 1C) . For depolarizing opsins, the yellow PL of Ce:GAGG (1.8 mW/cm 2 ) elicited the largest photocurrents in cells expressing the red-shifted opsin bReaChES (13) (340.3 \u00b1 43.1 pA, n = 12; Fig. 1D ). Regarding inhibitory opsins, the anion channelrhodopsin GtACR1 (14) showed the strongest activation (627.2 \u00b1 80.2 pA, n = 12; Fig. 1E ) in response to the PL of Ce:GAGG (1.8 mW/cm 2 ). PL-irradiation of GFP-expressing cells induced undetectable currents (Fig. 1 , D and E). Thus, Ce:GAGG PL can activate red-shifted opsins that are used for optogenetic control of neurons. Furthermore, the yellow PL of Ce:GAGG could also induce significant activation of enzyme rhodopsin BeGC1 (15) (fig. S3 ), suggesting that the scintillation of Ce:GAGG can be used for activation of various light-sensitive proteins.\n\nWe next tested the ability of Ce:GAGG PL to actuate neuronal membrane potentials in vitro. Credependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors were injected into the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of DAT-IRES-Cre mice to induce the specific expression of bReaChES in dopamine (DA) neurons ( Fig. 2A and fig. S4 ). In acute slice preparations, 1-s pulses of the yellow PL of Ce:GAGG elicited depolarizing photocurrents in DA neurons in a PL intensity-dependent manner ( Fig. 2B ) Irradiation with 13.5 \u00b5W/cm 2 elicited action potentials in a fraction (2 out of 6) of DA neurons, and the rate of PL-evoked spikes was plateaued at approximately 40 \u00b5W/cm 2 (Fig. 2 , C and D). With a higher PL intensity (2.0 mW/cm 2 ), time-locked spiking up to 20 Hz could be induced with shorter (2 ms) pulses ( fig. S5 ). In DA neurons expressing inhibitory soma-targeted GtACR1 (16) (stGtACR1; fig. S4 ), hyperpolarizing photocurrents were induced by Ce:GAGG PL illumination, which attenuated action potential generation at 13.5 \u00b5W/cm 2 and maximally suppressed spiking at >30 \u00b5W/cm 2 PL (Fig. 2, F and G) . Thus, the Ce:GAGG crystal combined with bReaChES and stGtACR1 can serve as bi-directional optogenetic actuators.\n\nHaving identified scintillator-opsin combinations that modulate neuronal activity, we next examined the ability of X-ray-induced RL of the Ce:GAGG crystal to activate dissociated hippocampal neurons. The intensity of the RL emitted by the Ce:GAGG crystal was proportional to the intensity of X-rays (Fig. 3A ). X-ray irradiation for total 10 min (20 s pluses every 1 min, 30 times) induced c-Fos expression among bReaChES-expressing neurons only in the presence of Ce:GAGG crystals, but not under control conditions (Fig. 3 , B to D), suggesting that the RL of Ce:GAGG can activate bReaChES-expressing neurons. Before the scintillation-mediated optogenetics is adapted to living animals, the biocompatibility of the scintillator was assessed. The vast majority of dissociated hippocampal neurons around the Ce:GAGG crystal in the culture dish survived for 7 days (Fig. 3E) , and a fraction of neurites extended toward the crystal (Fig. 3E) . Similarly, HEK 293 cells cultured in the presence of the Ce:GAGG crystal proliferated at a normal rate ( fig. S6 ). Furthermore, rod-shaped Ce:GAGG crystals (size: 0.5 mm \u00d7 0.5 mm \u00d7 1.0\u22121.5 mm) implanted into the brain for four weeks did not cause activation of glial cells beyond that caused by biocompatible optic fibers ( Fig. 3F and fig. S7 ). Thus, the Ce:GAGG crystal is biocompatible and could be implanted without cytotoxicity.\n\nWe finally tested whether scintillation-mediated actuation of neurons in vivo could induce behavioral changes. Transient activation and inhibition of DA neurons in the VTA is sufficient for behavioral conditioning (17) (18) (19) . We therefore induced the expression of excitatory bReaChES or inhibitory stGtACR1 in VTA-DA neurons through viral injections, and bilaterally implanted rodshaped Ce:GAGG crystals over the VTA (Fig. 4A) . The conditioned place preference (CPP) test was performed by placing the mice into a test chamber with two compartments, only one of which was irradiated by X-rays ( Fig. 4B and fig. S8 ). The initial place preference was not different among opsin-expressing and GFP-expressing control mice (Fig. 4C ). After two days of conditioning, however, mice expressing bReaChES had a significantly greater tendency to spend more time in the X-ray conditioned compartment (Fig. 4, D and E, and fig.  S9 ), whereas those expressing stGtACR1 spent significantly less time in the conditioned compartment (Fig. 4 , D and E). Control mice did not change place preference after conditioning (Fig.  4, D and E, and fig. S9 ). These opsin-expressing mice did not show any difference in the body weight, spontaneous locomotor and rearing behaviors compared to control mice ( fig. S10 ). Xirradiation of an implanted Ce:GAGG crystal did not affect the temperature of the ambient tissue ( fig.  S2 ).\n\nThus, scintillation-mediated remote optogenetics can be used for bi-directional neuronal actuation deep in the brain of mice, resulting in behavioral changes.\n\nNeuronal precursor cells are the most radiosensitive cells in the brain (20, 21) . Acute irradiation of mice with high-dose X-rays (9 Gy) induced apoptotic cell death among putative neuronal precursor cells as detected with active caspase-3 immunoreactivity ( Fig. 4F and fig. S11 ). However, we hardly observed apoptotic signals in the brain irradiated with fractionated X-ray irradiations in our test chamber which are essentially the same as those during the CPP test ( Fig. 4F and fig. S11 ). Moreover, 10-min X-irradiation of mice in our test chamber did not cause abnormality in the homecage behavior (fig. S12). Thus, the fractionated Xray irradiation during the behavioral testing might not induce acute neuronal dysfunction.\n\nWe have here demonstrated the feasibility of a novel, scintillation-mediated optogenetic technology that allows fully wireless control of neuronal activity in behaving animals. The scintillator crystal was biocompatible and safely implantable for long periods. Thermal effects on neuronal activity were negligible using this technology, a significant advantage over conventional (22, 23) and NIR-mediated (9, 10) optogenetics. Given the deep tissue penetration of X-rays ( Fig.  1A) , scintillation-mediated optogenetics can be readily applied to larger animals including monkeys. Future innovations and technical advances, such as minimizing the size of the implanted scintillator crystals, or reducing the dose of X-rays through the use of pulsed and targeted X-ray irradiation, should further enable manipulation of neuronal functions with less invasiveness.\n\nSince its discovery in the late 19th century (24), X-rays have been widely used for medical imaging and cancer therapy. However, X-rays have never been used for controlling physiological functions of cells in living animals, as we have shown here. The development of scintillation-mediated optogenetics thus expands the range of X-ray applications to functional studies of biology and medicine. Biomedical technologies that use visible light for genome editing (25) or cancer therapy (26) would benefit from wireless application to deeper tissues, which is now possible with scintillation-mediated approaches.\n\nWe thank H.

For luminescence measurements and all experiments except for implantation in the brain, the crystal was fabricated into 3\u22128 mm rectangular blocks 0.5\u22121 mm thick. For implanting the crystals in the mouse brain, rod-shaped Ce:GAGG crystals (0.5 mm \u00d7 0.5 mm \u00d7 3.0 mm) obtained from Furukawa were cut into smaller pieces (0.5 mm \u00d7 0.5 mm \u00d7 1.0\u22121.5 mm) using a laser cutter and then slightly filed to round off the corners.\n\nThe PL of a Ce:GAGG crystal was induced with 365-nm UV light (LEDMOD V2, Omicron; LC-L2, Hamamatsu) unless otherwise noted. The PL intensity for electrophysiological recordings was routinely measured with a photodiode sensor (1 cm \u00d7 1 cm; PD300-1W, Ophir) placed over the recording chamber through a UV-cut filter fabricated from UV-cut goggles (SSUV 297, AS ONE) on each experimental day. In experiments using acute slices, the PL intensity over the slice in the recording chamber was measured. The intensity of unfiltered UV light over the recording chamber was <0.1 \u00b5W/cm 2 . The RL power of a Ce:GAGG crystal was measured with a fiber-coupled photoreceiver (Newport 2151) through an optical fibre (tip diameter: 200 \u00b5m) placed close to a Ce:GAGG crystal exposed to X-ray irradiation in an X-ray machine (MX-160Labo, mediXtec). The photoreceiver current, which was sampled using an analogue-digital converter (Picoscope 4262, Pico Technology), was calibrated against the PL power measured by the photodiode sensor and converted to luminescence intensity (in watts). PL emission spectra under UV illumination (340 \u00b1 10 nm, LAX-103, Asahi Spectra) were measured using a spectrometer (QE-Pro, Ocean Optics). RL emission spectra under X-ray irradiation (70 kV, 1 mA) were measured through an optical fibre using a CCD spectrometer (DU-420-BU2, Andor) (12).\n\nAll experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Physiological Society of Japan and approved by the institutional review board of the Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, Nagoya University, Japan. Adult C57BL6/J mice and DAT-IRES-Cre mice (27) (B6.SJL-Slc6a3 tm1.1(cre)Bkmn /J, The Jackson Laboratory) of both sexes were maintained on a 12-h light-dark cycle (lights were turned on at 8:00 am), with free access to food and water. DAT-IRES-Cre mice were maintained as homogenic mutants. Only 11\u221218-week-old male DAT-IRES-Cre mice were used for the CPP experiments.\n\nFor expression in HEK293 cells, all plasmids encoding opsins and fluorescent proteins were constructed by subcloning into an empty pCMV vector unless otherwise noted. pCMV-PsChR-Venus and pCMV-C1V1-Venus were obtained from H. Yawo (Tohoku University). bReaChES-TS-eYFP was isolated from pAAV-CaMKIIa-DIO-bReaChes-TS-eYFP gifted by K. Deisseroth (Stanford University). A full-length gene encoding BeGC1 (accession number KF309499) was synthesized after human codon optimization and inserted into the peGFP-N1 vector. For expression in primary cultured neurons, the bReaChES-TS-eYFP fragment was subcloned into an empty pCAG vector. For AAV production, pAAV-Ef1a-DIO-bReaChes-TS-eYFP was obtained from K. Deisseroth (Stanford University) and pAAV-hSyn1-SIO-stGtACR1-FusionRed was obtained from Addgene (#105678).\n\nCell culture and transfection For electrophysiological recordings in cultured cells, expression vector plasmids encoding opsins or hrGFP were transfected into HEK 293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 3-4 hours after transfection, and then seeded on a coverslip (12 mm diameter) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. The cells were maintained in the medium in an incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 /95% air for 24\u221236 hours before recordings.\n\nDissociated hippocampal neurons were prepared from embryonic (E17.5) mice. Isolated hippocampal tissues were incubated with Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS; Sigma-Aldrich) containing 1% DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich) and 2.5% trypsin for 10 min at 37\u00b0C, and then washed three times with HBSS. The tissues were then dispersed by pipetting in Neurobasal medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After removing aggregated cells by filtration, the hippocampal cells were seeded on a coverslip (12 mm diameter) coated with poly-L-lysine in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. The culture medium was subsequently replaced by Neurobasal medium supplemented with 0.5 mM GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 2% (vol/vol) B-27 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 100 U/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. After 2 days in vitro (DIV 2), DNA plasmids carrying bReaChES-eYFP (1 \u00b5g/dish) or hrGFP (1 \u00b5g/dish) were transfected into cultured neurons using Lipofectamine 2000. The cultured neurons were maintained in the medium in an incubator at 34\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 and 95% air.\n\nViral production For AAV production, HEK293 cells were transfected with vector plasmids including pAAV encoding an opsin, .

After three days, transfected cells were collected and suspended in lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 8.0). After four freeze-thaw cycles, the cell lysate was treated with 250 U/ml benzonase nuclease (Merck) and 1 mM MgCl 2 for 10\u221215 min at 37 \u00b0C and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. AAV was then purified from the supernatant by iodixanol gradient ultracentrifugation. The purified AAV solution was concentrated in PBS via filtration and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\n\nIn vitro X-ray irradiation test Tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 \u00b5M) was applied to the primary hippocampal culture by adding a stock solution of TTX to the culture media at DIV 9, and the culture dishes were maintained at 34\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 and 95% air for 24 h. At DIV 10, the culture media was replaced with TTX-free Neurobasal media, and then the dishes were placed over Ce:GAGG crystals and irradiated with X-rays (150 kV, 3 mA, 1.35 Gy/min, 20 sec, every 1 min, 30 times) at room temperature (RT). The dishes were then maintained at 34\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 and 95% air. At 2 h after X-ray irradiation, the cultured cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min at RT, and then rinsed with PBS.\n\nGloSensor assay HEK293 cells were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing L-glutamine and phenol red (Wako) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS and penicillinstreptomycin. The cells were co-transfected with the BeGC1 plasmid and the pGloSensor-42F cGMP vector (Promega) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fischer Scientific). After transfection, 0.5 \u00b5M all-trans-retinal (Toronto Research Chemicals) was added to the culture medium. Before measurements, the culture medium was replaced with a CO 2 -independent medium containing 10% (vol/vol) FBS and 2% (vol/vol) GloSensor cGMP stock solution (Promega). The cells were then incubated for 2 h at 27\u00b0C in the dark. Intracellular cGMP levels were measured by monitoring luminescence intensity using a microplate reader (Corona Electric) at 27\u00b0C (28).\n\nStereotactic surgery AAV-Ef1a-DIO-bReaChes-TS-eYFP (titer: 6.0 \u00d7 10 13 copies/ml), AAV-hSyn1-SIO-stGtACR1-FusionRed (titer: 1.1 \u00d7 10 13 copies/ml) or AAV-CMV-DIO-hrGFP (titer: 6.0 \u00d7 10 12 copies/ml) was injected bilaterally into the VTA (AP: from -3.0 to -3.3 mm, LM: \u00b10.5 mm, depth: 4.2 mm) of DAT-IRES-Cre mice under ~1.2% isoflurane anesthesia. Injection volume was 200 nl per site. The mice were kept in their home cages for at least 3 weeks after AAV injection, prior to behavioral or electrophysiological experiments. The biocompatibility of the scintillator crystal was assessed by implanting a rod-shaped Ce:GAGG crystal (0.5 mm \u00d7 0.5 mm \u00d7 1.0\u22121.5 mm) over the VTA using a metal guide tube (inner diameter: 0.5 mm) with a movable metal plunger. After crystal implantation, the metal guide tube was first withdrawn and then the plunger was retracted. An optical fiber (0.4 mm diameter) attached to a stainless steel ferrule (CFM14L10, Thorlabs) was implanted over the VTA using a cannula holder (XCF, Thorlabs). The optical fiber cannula was permanently cemented to the skull.\n\nSlice preparation Mice were perfused under isoflurane anesthesia with icecold dissection buffer containing (in mM): 87 NaCl, 25 NaHCO 3 , 25 D-glucose, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH 2 PO 4 , 0.5 CaCl 2 , 7 MgCl 2 , and 75 sucrose, aerated with 95% O 2 + 5% CO 2 . The mice were then decapitated, and the brain was isolated and cut into 200-\u03bcm-thick horizontal sections on a vibratome in the ice-cold dissection buffer. The slices containing the VTA were incubated for 30 min at 35\u00b0C in the dissection buffer and maintained thereafter at RT in standard artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 25 NaHCO 3 , 25 D-glucose, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH 2 PO 4 , 1 MgCl 2 , and 2 CaCl 2 ), aerated with 95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 .\n\nIn vitro electrophysiology Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from cultured HEK 293 cells or VTA-DA neurons in acute brain slices were performed using an IPA amplifier (Sutter Instruments) at RT. Fluorescently labelled cells were visually identified using an upright microscope (BX51WI; Olympus) equipped with a scientific complementary metal-oxidesemiconductor (sCMOS) video camera (Zyla4.2plus; Andor). The recording pipettes (5\u22127 M\u03a9) were filled with the intracellular solution containing (in mM): 135 potassium gluconate, 4 KCl, 4 Mg-ATP, 10 Na 2phosphocreatine, 0.3 Na-GTP, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 280 mOsmol/l). Patch pipettes (5-7 M\u03a9) had a series resistance of 6.5-25 M\u03a9, which was compensated to have a final value of 6.5-7.0 M\u03a9 for voltage-clamp recordings (29). For measuring photocurrents of depolarizing opsins, HEK 293 cells or DA neurons were voltage-clamped at \u221260 mV. For measuring the photocurrents of GtACR1 and GtACR2, cells were voltage-clamped at 0 mV (HEK 293 cells) or \u221230 mV (DA neurons). For measuring the photocurrents of ArchT or eNpHR3.0, cells were voltage-clamped at \u221220-0 mV to achieve near zero holding currents. For currentclamp recordings from DA neurons, the membrane potentials were held at around \u221260 mV to prevent spontaneous firings. The PL intensity of the specimen was measured using a photodiode sensor that was routinely calibrated for each experiment.\n\nConditioned place preference test More than 2 weeks after AAV injection, mice were bilaterally implanted with the rod-shaped Ce:GAGG crystals (0.5 mm \u00d7 0.5 mm \u00d7 1.0\u22121.5 mm) and used for behavioral tests at >1 week after crystal implantation. Conditioned place preference (CPP) tests were performed in an X-ray machine (MX-160Labo, mediXtec Japan) at the dark period. On the first day of the tests, mice were placed in a test chamber with two compartments (each 10 cm \u00d7 12 cm) with different floor textures and visual cues on the walls (Fig. 4B) . The mice were habituated to the chamber for 5 min and then allowed to explore freely for 10 min without X-ray irradiation. On the second and third days, the mice were conditioned for 10 min in the chamber in the chamber in which only one of the compartments received X-ray irradiation (150 kV, 3 mA; fig. S8 ). To restrict the X-ray irradiation to one side, the other compartment was partially shielded with lead boards (Fig.  4B ). On the fourth day, the mice were placed in the chamber for 10 min without X-ray irradiation. In the unbiased CPP tests, the mice were videotaped at an oblique angle using a USB camera while the whole chamber was illuminated by ambient white LED light, and the ears of mice were tracked offline using DeepLabCut (30). For the biased CPP tests (fig. S9 ), a soft floor mat was placed in the non-X-irradiated compartment so that the mice could spend less time in the X-irradiated compartment. In the biased CPP tests, the mice were filmed under infrared (IR) light using an IR camera, and the total time spent in each compartment was measured based on the location of the mouse head. After completion of the CPP tests, the mice were perfused with 4% PFA and the brain was postfixed overnight. The brain was cut into coronal sections (section thickness: 80 \u00b5m) and the Ce:GAGG implantation sites were observed. The trace of the implanted crystal was observed at 0\u2212200 \u00b5m from the closest edge of labelled VTA. One mouse that showed considerable damage to the VTA caused by a ventrally-implanted crystal was excluded from the analysis.\n\nFor immunostaining of cultured neurons, fixed neurons were washed three times with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.25% Triton-X in PBS (blocking buffer), and then incubated with primary antibodies (anti-GFP, mouse monoclonal, 1:1000, Wako; anti-c-Fos, rabbit polyclonal, 1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in blocking buffer for 24\u221248 h at 4\u00b0C. The fixed neurons were washed three times with blocking buffer and then incubated with secondary antibodies (CF594 donkey anti-rabbit IgG, 1:1000, Biotium; CF488A donkey anti-mouse IgG, 1:1000, Biotium) overnight at 4\u00b0C.\n\nFor immunostaining of brain slices, we performed transcardial perfusion and post-fixation for overnight using 4% PFA. The fixed brains were sectioned into coronal or horizontal slices on a vibratome (section thickness: 80 \u00b5m). The slices were washed three times with blocking buffer, and then incubated with primary antibodies (anti-tyrosine hydroxylase, rabbit polyclonal, 1:1000, Merck Millipore; anti-Iba1, rabbit monoclonal, 1:1000, Wako; anti-GFAP, mouse monoclonal, 1:1000, Merck Millipore; anti-GFP, mouse monoclonal, 1:1000, Wako; anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175), rabbit polyclonal, 1:200, Cell Signaling Technology) in blocking buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C. The slices were then washed three times with blocking buffer and then incubated with secondary antibodies (CF594-or CF488A-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, 1:1000, Biotium; CF488A-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG, 1:1000, Biotium) in blocking buffer for 1-2 h at RT. Cellular nuclei were stained by incubation for 10-15 min with DAPI (2 \u00b5M in phosphate buffer) at RT. The stained samples were mounted using DABCO, and observed under a florescence microscope (BZ-9000, Keyence) or confocal microscope (LSM710, Zeiss). The green signal of bReaChES-eYFP ( Fig. 4A and fig. S4a ) was further enhanced by immunostaining using anti-GFP antibody.\n\nThe number of HEK 293 cells in 35-mm culture dishes ( fig.  S6 ) was counted by randomly selecting 100 \u00b5m \u00d7 100 \u00b5m squares surrounding the Ce:GAGG crystal for the dishes containing the crystal or anywhere on the coverslip for control dishes. The mean cell density was calculated as the average of the cell densities of three sites per dish.\n\nTo estimate the survival rate of dissociated hippocampal neurons (Fig. 3E) , we randomly selected three 0.2 mm \u00d7 1.0 mm rectangles per dish, surrounding the Ce:GAGG crystal (one of the longer sides of the rectangle was attached to the edge of the crystal) for the dishes containing the crystal or anywhere on the coverslip for control dishes. The dissociated neurons within these sites at DIV1 were monitored at DIV2, 4, and 7.\n\nTo quantify the pixel intensity in epifluorescence images ( fig. S7) , a 0.1 mm \u00d7 0.3 mm rectangle was drawn around the trace of the Ce:GAGG crystal or the optical fibre (one of the shorter sides of the rectangle was attached to the edge of the trace; three sites per image). The rectangle was divided into three sections measuring 0.1 mm \u00d7 0.1 mm, and the mean pixel intensity of each square was calculated. The mean global intensity for one image was calculated as the average pixel intensity of the nine squares.\n\nTo analyze animal movements in the CPP tests using DeepLabCut (30), the left and right ears of mice were manually annotated using 20\u221280 frames per movie to train a deep neural network. An estimated ear position with low likelihood (<0.8) was omitted and replaced with a pixel value obtained using linear interpolation of neighboring .

The middle pixel coordinate between the tracked left and right ears was considered the animal trajectory, assuming that the coordinate represented the location of the mouse head. The heat maps shown in Fig. 4D indicate the probability of the presence of the animal trajectory within each 100 \u00d7 100 pixel image. The number of rearing events was calculated by counting the number of times that the height of the mouse head exceeded a threshold level. In the unbiased CPP test (Fig. 4, D and E) , two animals that showed biased initial preference (>95% preference for one of the two compartments) and one animal that exhibited extremely low locomotor activity were excluded from the analysis.\n\nAll values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical analyses were performed using one-or two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison tests or Dunn's multiple comparison tests vs. the control with GraphPad Prism or Igor Pro, unless otherwise noted.\n\n.

(D) Confocal images of cleaved caspase-3 immunostaining (red) in the hippocampal subgranular zone (SGZ, left), the subventricular (subependymal) zone (SVZ, middle) and the VTA of a mouse irradiated with acute highdose X-ray (150 kV, 3 mA; 1.35 Gy/min, total 9 Gy). The mouse was perfused at 6 h after X-irradiation, the timing when the apoptotic signal would be peaked (20, 21) . Arrows indicate active caspase-3-positive apoptotic cells or cell clusters. LV indicates the lateral ventricle outlined with a dashed line. Images shown in Fig. 4F were outlined with a gray line. Blue: DAPI. (E) Same as (D), but the mouse was irradiated with fractionated X-ray (150 kV, 3 mA; 1 min per 2 min, 5 times per day, 2 days) in the X-irradiated compartment of the CPP test chamber. The mouse was perfused at 6 h after the last fraction of radiation. (F) Same as (D), but the mouse was not irradiated with X-rays.\n\n.
