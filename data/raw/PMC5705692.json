{"title": "The efficacy of medical masks and respirators against respiratory infection in healthcare workers", "body": "There is currently a lack of consensus around the efficacy of medical masks and respirators for healthcare workers (HCWs) against influenza, with only five published randomised control trials (RCTs) in HCWs conducted to date.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 While N95 respirators have been shown to be superior to medical masks in preventing clinical respiratory infection (CRI), influenza illness (ILI) and other outcomes, none of the studies were adequately powered to examine laboratory\u2010confirmed influenza.\n\nIn the smallest of the trials, involving only 32 HCWs, there was no difference in the rates of respiratory illnesses between HCWs who used medical masks and the control group.1 A Canadian study of 422 hospital nurses compared targeted use of N95 respirators and medical masks and found that the rate of serologically defined influenza was 25% in both arms.2 However, in the absence of a control arm for comparison, the finding of no difference in outcomes between the intervention arms could represent either equal efficacy or equal inefficacy of the two interventions. The other two published HCW RCTs used a more specific and less sensitive definition of influenza based on nucleic acid testing (NAT) of respiratory specimens in symptomatic subjects. As such, even these substantially larger RCTs were unable to demonstrate any significant difference in influenza infection between N95 respirators and medical masks.3, 4 Finally, a recent study examined the efficacy of cloth masks compared to medical mask and control groups, and found that cloth masks may increase the risk of infection in HCWs.5\n\n\nGuidelines for respiratory protection have been driven by presumed transmission mode alone, and under an assumption that influenza and other pathogens are spread by one mode alone.6 However, the paradigm of unimodal droplet or airborne spread is based on outmoded experiments from the 1940s, which concluded that only large droplets are found at close proximity to the patient, while small droplet nuclei and airborne particles are found at a longer distance.7, 8, 9 It has since been shown that both small and large particles can exist at short distances from the patient, and that aerosolised transmission can occur at close proximity.9\n\n\nIn our two published RCTs conducted in China,3, 4 we used the same outcomes, case definitions and measurement tools, and used the same testing methods for a range of different pathogens transmitted by different routes. This afforded an opportunity to pool the data from both trials for improved statistical power to examine the outcomes by pathogens and mode of transmission. The aim of this pooled analysis was to examine the efficacy of medical masks and respirators in HCWs against respiratory infection.\n\nEthics approvals of two clinical trials were obtained from the Institutional Review Board and Human Research Ethics Committee of the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control.\n\nWe did not involve patients and their families in the design and conduct of the study. We have acknowledged the support of participants, and the results will be published in open access journal.\n\nThe data sets from the two trials were pooled incorporating the common variables. We calculated the attack rate (proportion of outcome) of each of the four outcomes by the study arms.\n\nWe conducted a fixed effect individual patient data (IPD) meta\u2010analysis by fitting a multivariable log binomial model, using generalised estimating equation (GEE) to account for clustering by hospital/ward. We used a fitted fixed effect model because there are only two trials. Two studies were conducted in the same setting with similar participant characteristics, and they examined the same underlying effect. In the analysis, relative risk (RR) was estimated using the control arm as the referent category after adjusting for potential confounders and their interaction terms with a trial ID number. The overall rates of seasonal infection were higher in the second trial than the first. The consistency assumption (ie between study homogeneity) for the IPD meta\u2010analysis was tested by fitting an interaction term between trial ID and trial arms where a significant interaction is indicative of inconsistency.13 Any interaction term (between trial ID and covariates other than trial arm) that was not a confounder was subsequently excluded from the model using backward elimination approach. This approach is described in detailed elsewhere.4 We repeated the above\u2010described methods for each of the outcomes.\n\nAfter combining the data sets from the two trials, 3591 cases were entered into the pooled analysis (1064 cases in the medical mask arm, 516 cases in the targeted N95 arm, 1530 cases in the continuous N95 arm and 481 cases in the control arm). The infection outcomes are presented in Figure 1. The rates of laboratory\u2010confirmed viral respiratory infection (26/1530, 1.7%), laboratory\u2010confirmed bacterial colonisation (79/1530, 5.2%) and droplet\u2010transmitted infections (62/1530, 4.1%) were lowest among the continuous N95 arm. Laboratory\u2010confirmed influenza A and B was lowest in continuous N95 (6/1530, 0.4%) and targeted N95 arms (2/516, 0.4%).\n\nIn the IPD meta\u2010analysis, none of the interaction terms between trial arm and trial ID was significant for any of the outcome variables. Thus, the consistency assumption for the IPD meta\u2010analysis was satisfied. However, a significant interaction was observed between trial ID and hand washing for laboratory\u2010confirmed bacterial colonisation only; therefore, we estimated the RR for trial ID stratified by hand washing.\n\nFigure 2 shows the forest plot of outcomes according to various interventions. All outcomes were consistently lower in the continuous N95 and targeted N95 arms. The IPD meta\u2010analysis shows that the risk of laboratory\u2010confirmed bacterial colonisation was lower in the continuous N95 arm (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.21\u20100.51 or 67% efficacy) and targeted N95 arm (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.33\u20100.87 or 46% efficacy) (Table 1).\n\nLaboratory\u2010confirmed viral respiratory infections were significantly lower in the continuous N95 arm (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.23\u20100.91, or 54% efficacy). The rates of laboratory\u2010confirmed virus were also lower in the targeted N95 arm (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.30\u20101.67) and medical masks arm (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.39\u20101.56); however, the difference was not statistically significant (Table 2).\n\nLaboratory\u2010confirmed influenza was also lowest in continuous N95 arm (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.10\u20101.11) but not significant (Table 3). In the subgroup analysis of droplet\u2010transmitted infections, compared to the control arm, the efficacy of continuous N95 respirators against droplet\u2010transmitted infections (bacterial and viral) was 74% (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.16\u20100.42) and 57% in the targeted N95 arm (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.25\u20100.72) (Table 4).\n\nInclusion of RSV cases in the droplet\u2010transmitted pathogen category did not change the risk ratio to a large extent. If RSV cases were also included in the droplet\u2010transmitted pathogen category, the efficacy was 70% in the continuous N95 (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.19\u20100.46) and 51% in the targeted N95 arms (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30\u20100.80). The rate of droplet only transmitting viral infections was also lower in the continuous N95 and targeted N95 arms. HCWs who used a continuous N95 and targeted respirator were 85% (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04\u20100. 59) and 84% (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.02\u20100.88) less likely to acquire droplet\u2010transmitted viral infections.\n\nWhen only the continuous N95 arm was compared against control, the risk of laboratory\u2010confirmed influenza was significantly lower in continuous N95 arm (RR 0.23 and 95% CI 0.06\u20100.93, or 77% efficacy). In the similar analysis, the risk of influenza was also lower in medical mask arm compared to control; however, the difference was not statistically significant (RR 0.81 and 95% CI 0.25\u20102.68) arm. Table 5 compares the results of this analysis with the individual studies.\n\nWe demonstrated superior clinical efficacy of continuous use of N95 respirator (also known as \u201cairborne precautions\u201d) against infections presumed to be spread by the droplet mode, including influenza. This suggests that transmission is more complex than assumed by traditional classifications, and supports the fact that both large and small droplets are present close to the patient, and that aerosol transmission may occur for presumed \u201cdroplet\u201d infections. Respirators are designed to provide respiratory protection through filtration and fit, and properly fitted respirators provide better protection compared to medical masks.3, 4 We could not demonstrate efficacy of medical masks against any outcome, but the non\u2010significant trend appeared to be towards protection. Medical masks may well have efficacy,5 but if so, the degree of efficacy was too small to detect in this study, and larger studies are needed, given the widespread use of these devices in health care.\n\nThe practical implication of this research is illustrated with influenza as a case in point. Droplet and contact are thought to be primary modes of transmission for seasonal influenza; therefore, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines recommend medical masks during routine patient care, while N95 respirators are recommended during procedures in which aerosols may be generated and during other high\u2010risk situations.14, 15 However, there is increasing evidence of aerosol transmission of influenza during routine care as well (in the absence of aerosol generating procedures), which may warrant superior respiratory protection.16, 17 Influenza research is challenging because there is high seasonal variation in activity, and the level of circulating influenza in any given year cannot be predicted when planning RCTs. In addition, a diagnosis of influenza requires the detection of virus from respiratory specimens, or a fourfold rise in serological titres, both of which are highly resource\u2010intensive and depend on daily subject follow\u2010up and on optimal timing of specimen collection. For all these reasons, the published studies to date have been unable to determine whether there is a difference in efficacy against influenza infection between medical masks and N95 respirators. This study can therefore usefully inform policies for prevention of influenza.\n\nIn the first RCT, compared to medical masks, N95 respirators were found to be protective against CRI, but not against ILI or laboratory\u2010confirmed influenza.3 When compared with the control arm, rates of laboratory\u2010confirmed virus and bacterial colonisation were significantly lower in N95 arm (Table 5). In the second RCT, continuous use of N95 respirators was associated with lower rates of CRI and laboratory\u2010confirmed bacterial colonisation compared to the medical mask use.4 Pooled analysis of these studies improved the power to analyse other infectious outcomes by intervention and to allow analysis by mode of transmission.\n\nAn important finding of this analysis was the efficacy of N95 respirators against droplet\u2010transmitted infections. Generally, medical masks are considered sufficient for droplet\u2010transmitted infections such as influenza.18 However, this study has demonstrated a clear benefit of using N95 respirators (both continuous and targeted) to protect HCWs against droplet infections and does not show significant protection of medical masks. In the light of these findings, it may be prudent to use respirators when the transmission mode of a disease is unknown or when HCWs exposed to droplet\u2010transmitted infections with a high\u2010case fatality rate.6 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV) and Ebola virus disease (EVD) are not airborne infections, yet the CDC recommendation of using respirators to protect HCWs recognises the uncertainty around transmission.19, 20 The CDC initially recommended medical masks for Ebola, but changed their guidelines when US HCWs became infected, amidst unrest and challenges to the prior guidelines.6, 21 In contrast, the WHO recommends medical masks for MERS\u2010CoV and Ebola 22, 23 despite having older guidelines for filoviruses which recommended respirators.24 There is a need for a more evidence\u2010based approach to updating guidelines and ensuring consistency between different guidelines.25\n\n\nOur study also demonstrated that, over and above the benefit of continuous use, targeted use of N95 is associated with reduced risk of infection. Many guidelines recommend targeted use,14, 15, 26 and our study supports this practice. However, better protection is achieved through continuous use of respirators. This may be because HCWs cannot always identify situations in which they are at risk, especially in busy clinical settings with a high level of movement of patients and staff in and out of wards.\n\nThis study has some limitations. Firstly, the reporting of the results included in Figure 1 is different from the IPD meta\u2010analysis results. This is due to the uneven distribution of randomisation arms and differing seasonal attack rates between the trials. In Figure 1, these between\u2010trial differences were not taken into account. The IPD meta\u2010analysis takes into account of these and gives an unbiased association. Secondly, the control arm in trial 1 was not randomised; however, the risk of bias is less due to similar study setting, outcome measures and participant characteristics. Moreover, whether infection was acquired in the community or the hospital cannot be determined, but the RCT design should result in community exposure being distributed equally across all arms. Finally, we categorised pathogens according to various transmission modes, while certain viruses are transmitted via multiple routes. The pooled data were suggestive of an effect of respirators against influenza, but probably did not have enough statistical power for this outcome. The major strength of this study is the use of the same endpoints, measurements and methods in the two trials, which allowed valid pooling of the data.\n\nIt is a long\u2010held belief in hospital infection control that a mask is adequate for droplet\u2010transmitted infections. We showed that the use of respirators provides better protection against respiratory infections, even those presumed to be spread predominantly by the droplet mode. The targeted use of a respirator was also effective, whereas no efficacy was demonstrated for medical masks alone. However, the trends suggest some degree of protection from medical masks, and larger studies are required to measure the efficacy of these devices. The superiority of respirators should be reflected in infection control guidelines to ensure the occupational health and safety of HCWs. A growing body of clinical efficacy evidence, including this study, challenges long\u2010held paradigms about the transmission of infection.\n\n\nThe data collected during two similar clinical trials conducted in Beijing, China, which examined the same infection outcomes, were pooledWe showed that respirators provide superior protection against droplet\u2010transmitted infections, for which most guidelines recommend masks. These findings challenge the paradigm of infection transmission being simplified to droplet, airborne or contact.For many infections, more than one mode of transmission is possible, and our data suggest that transmission of infections is more complex than suggested by these paradigms.Clinical efficacy data are a higher level of evidence than theoretical paradigms of transmission, and show better protection afforded by respirators.\n\n\nAll authors have completed the Unified Competing Interest form (available on request from the corresponding author) and declare that; (i) Professor C.
