{"title": "Synthetic approaches and pharmaceutical applications of chloro-containing molecules for drug discovery: A critical review", "body": "Chlorine is one of the most vital industrial chemicals, which was utilized by various end-users of industries. And it has been tremendous sprite in pharmaceuticals as the major key ingredients in drugs to treat many diseases such as meningitis, cholera, plague, typhoid, bacterial skin infections, respiratory and nervous system problems etc., as per the Business Wire and A Berkshire Hathaway Company reports. The therapeutics and percentage of sales were presented to address the importance of chlorine chemistry in pharmaceutical drugs as what have been reported by HIS Applied Economics, Canada (Table 1 ). In United States, more than 88% of the pharmaceuticals were depended on chlorine chemistry including the drugs those have been used for the treatment of stomach ulcer, cancer, anemia, high cholesterol, depression, and epilepsy. As per statistics, the benefit from the chlorine chemistry was estimated to $450 billion per year. The net gain of the pharmaceuticals in the U.S. and Canada using chlorine is as high as $640 billion per year from the health care system reported by HIS Applied Economics, Canada [1] . According to the Business Wire and A Berkshire Hathaway Company reports, the estimating chlorine market for the period of 2018e2023 is approximately 4.8%. Some of the drugs presented with chemical structures containing chlorine (number of groups are different). One of the studies detailed that, 163 compounds among 233 approved drugs; nearly 73% of them contained single chlorine atom [2] . Of which, 23% of them possessed by two chlorines, 2.6% of them possessed by three chlorine atoms, 1.4% of them possessed by four chlorines, and 2.5% of them possessed by six chlorines in the compounds. Surprisingly, none of the drugs had been approved with five chlorine atoms yet. Also, among them, 98% were monosubstituted (CCl), only four were disubstituted (CCl 2 ), and none of the approved drugs has trisubstituted (CCl 3 ) groups. This interesting research gap suggests that, chlorine will further continue its industry ruler role to provide and benefit consumers of the pharmaceuticals in the future [1] . To improve the quality and advantage of chlorinated chemistry, scientists need to an advance understanding of the chlorine in the view of medicinal chemistry in the future (see Table 2 ).\n\nThe presence of chlorine atom played a pivotal role in a number of natural products such as the antibiotics clindamycin [3] , vancomycin [4] , chloramphenicol [5] , and griseofulvin. Over the course of time it has been found empirically that the introduction of a chlorine atom into one or more specific positions of a biologically active molecule may substantially improve the intrinsic biological activity [6] . The properties of the carbon-chlorine bond (C-Cl) in organochlorines have been analysed by Henschler [4, 5] . However, in the low-molecular-weight chemicals investigated in that analysis, the electrophilic reactivity of the carbon centre adjacent to the chlorine atom, which facilitates displacement of chlorine by (bio) nucleophiles, determines the observed biological properties [4, 5] . The increase of lipophilicity of the whole molecule by a chlorine substituent leads to a higher partitioning of a chlorinated compound into the lipophilic phase of a cell membrane or lipophilic domains of a protein. This causes a higher local concentration of the compound near a biological target site, but, not necessarily a higher biological activity. The most important effect of a non-reactive chlorine atom in the biological activity of many compounds comes from chlorine as a substituent on an aromatic, heteroaromatic or olefinic moiety.\n\nThe properties mentioned above will give rise steric and/or electronic effects of the chlorine substituents and lead to local electronic attraction or repulsion or to steric interference with any amino acid residue surrounding the position of the chlorine atom in the binding pocket of the protein. This in turn may cause a tighter interaction or a loosening of the contacts to the amino acids close to the chlorine or in other parts of the active molecule. Either one may affect the function of the target protein and cause an increase or decrease of biological activity. In other cases however a chlorine substituent may have no specific effect on the primary biological properties of the molecule to which it is attached [7] . Chlorinated compounds are not necessarily toxic or dangerous. Highly reactive chemicals or polychlorinated compounds cannot be compared with regard to toxicological properties with unreactive compounds having a low degree of chlorination. The chlorine atom, as one of many possible substituents used in synthetic organic chemistry, will remain in the future one of the important tools for probing structure-activity relationships in life science research and as a molecular component in commercialized compounds, in order to provide safer, more selective and more environmentally compatible products with higher activity for medicine and agriculture [7] .\n\nThe application of chlorine in medicinal chemistry is one of the fastest growing hot areas in chemistry as its fascinating and instructive role of halogens distribution in the field of drug development. Surprisingly, among four halogens, chlorine (Cl) is the one which is more frequently found in drugs than others, even fluorine (F). Interestingly, in drugs, the elements of sulphur, chlorine, and fluorine were placed as 5e7 respectively after C, H, O, and N. The remaining phosphorous (P), bromine (Br), and iodine (I) are the rest of the top 10 elements in approved drugs, and remarkably, the Cl and F are the heavy hitters (Cl > F [ Br > I) [8e10].\n\nThe problem of antibiotic resistance among pathogenic bacteria is as old as antibiotics itself [11] . The antibiotic resistance which accelerated by the use and misuse of antimicrobial drugs has been a major universal challenge for public health. Remarkable increase of human pathogenic bacteria was observed from the past decades due to their resistance to one or more antibiotics. A number of infections caused by resistant organisms not succeed at responding to the conventional treatment and even the last choice antibiotics were also lost their power [12] . After all, loss of effectiveness and resistance power of old antibiotics against new and upcoming bacterial pathogens prompt us to develop novel, less toxic and highly effective antimicrobial agents with diverse structures to Table 1 The chlorine based drugs against categories of the diseases. Total, all categories $168.5 Table 2 List out the FDA approved chlorine containing drugs in market (1949e2012 fight with an emerging antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. In this review article, we have focused on chlorine containing analogues as a core substituent of antibacterial agents for drug development.\n\nMujumdar and co-workers synthesized a novel class of sulfamate-containing natural products and screened for their in vitro antibacterial properties. Title compound 143 was synthesized according to the literature reported as shown in Scheme 1. Commercially available 2-chloroadenosine 140 was reacted with tosylic acid under the optimal reaction condition to afford 2\u02b9,3\u02b9-Oisopropylidene protected adenosine precursors 141, which then reacted with chlorosulfonyl amine in the presence of DBU as base to obtain the corresponding 5\u02b9-o-sulfamoyl adenosine 142 in moderate to good yields. The protecting group of compound 142 was removed by using a mixture solution of TFA and water (v/v \u00bc 4:2) to afford the target compound 143. In vitro antimicrobial activity evaluation showed that the compound 143 possessed highest antibacterial activity with a MIC of 5 mM against E. coli [13] . The structure-activity relationship (SAR) revealed that the presence of chlorine atom highly enhanced the antibacterial properties of compound 143. In addition, the presences of sulfonamide group also most favour to increases the antibacterial activity of potent compound 143. The compound 143 as the lead compound need to be designed and synthesized for further investigation.\n\nWang and co-workers developed the chlorine containing thiochrome derivatives and screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activity. Substituted thiophenols (144a-d) were reacted with KOH and ethanol in the presence of water at 60 C to yield the compounds 145a-d. Compounds 145a-d were reacted with b-chloropropionic acid and then cyclized in the presence of concentrated H 2 SO 4 to afford thiochroman-4-ones 146a-d via intra-molecular Friedel-Crafts reaction. Later, compounds 146a-d were treated under Vilsmeier-Haack conditions to produce the key intermediates of 147a-d. Then, compounds 147a-d were reacted with various substituted amines and treated with NaBH(OAc) 3 in 1,2dichloroethane at room temperature to yield the final target compounds 148a-d (Scheme 2) [14] . All the synthesized compounds were tested for in vitro antifungal activities against different fungal strains. Based on the in vitro antimicrobial results, two compounds (148a and 148b) were showed an excellent antifungal activities against C. albicans (MICs \u00bc 0.5e8 mg/mL) and C. neoformans (MIC \u00bc 0.25e1 mg/mL) respectively [15] .\n\nKarthikeyan et al. synthesized the novel chlorine containing potent antimicrobial compounds 154a-f. From the beginning, starting material 149 was reacted with various substituted aldehydes (150a-f) in the presence of ethanol and Aq. KOH under reflux conditions to yield 1,3-diaryl-2-propen-1-ones (151a-f) in good yields. Then, compounds 151a-f underwent bromination in chloroform to give bromo substituted compounds 152a-f. Chalcone dibromides (152a-f) further treated with aryloxy acid hydrazides (153a-f) in the presence of triethylamine in absolute ethanol to furnish 1-aryloxy-3-aryl-5-hydroxy-5-aryl pyrazolines (154a-f, Scheme 3) in good yields. Compounds 154a (zone of inhibition was 22 mm against P. aeruginosa) and 154b (zone of inhibition was 21 mm against P. aeruginosa) turned out to be the most potent antibacterial agents. Compounds 154a (zone of inhibition was 21 mm against A. fumigatus) and 154b (zone of inhibition was 20 mm against P. marneffei) turned out to be the most potent antifungal agents [16] .\n\nVery recently, Zha and co-workers synthesized benzo[d]thiazole-hydrazones and tested for their in vitro antimicrobial activities. The synthetic route was depicted in Scheme 4</b>. The intermediate 7-methylbenzo[d]thiazol-2-amine (156) was synthesized according to the literature of reported method [17, 18] . Then, the presence of catalytic amount of glacial acetic acid. All the derivatives were obtained in good to excellent yield. All the obtained derivatives were evaluated for in vitro antimicrobial activities against various bacterial and fungal pathogens. Compound 158a was found to be the most potent antifungal agent with 33 mm inhibition zone at 100 mg/mL against A. niger. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) revealed that, the presence of electron withdrawing groups (EWGs) (Cl, Br, NO 2 and F) on the phenyl ring increased the antifungal properties and the presence of electron donating groups (EDGs) (OH and OCH 3 ) diminished the antifungal properties [19] . Compound 158a may serve as new potential antibacterial candidate in the future. Very recently, Goa et al. have developed the potent antimicrobial aminothiazolyl berberine derivatives (162a-h) as illustrated in <sb>Scheme 5.</b> Initial compound 159 was reacted with hydrazinecarbothioamide in the presence of glacial acetic acid and ethanol under optimal reaction conditions to afford the compounds 160a-h in moderate to good yields. Subsequently, compounds 160a-h were reacted with 2-chloroacetaldehyde to yield 161a-h. Finally, compounds 161a-h were converted into aminothiazolyl berberine derivatives (162a-h) by using substituted benzyl chlorides under optimal reaction conditions. Among all the synthesized derivatives, compound 162a showed excellent antibacterial activity with MIC value of 2 mmol/mL against Gram-negative A. baumanii. The SAR revealed that the introduction of chlorine atom significantly improved the antibacterial effect. The EWGs (Cl) was useful to improve antibacterial activity. Molecular docking showed that hydrogen bonds existed in the supramolecular interaction between DNA gyrase and the active molecule 162a (Fig. 1) . [20] .\n\nThe synthesis of novel class of antimicrobial quinoline bearing benzimidazole hybrids had been carried out by Garudachari et al. The targeted final compounds were synthesized through two steps.\n\nIn the first step, isatin (163) was reacted with a-methylketone (164) in aqueous ethanol to yielded 4-carboxyquinoline (165) in good yield [21e23]. In the second step, 165 was reacted with various aromatic-1,2-diamines in polyphosphoric acid media to afford quinoline incorporated benzimidazole derivatives (166a-f, Scheme 6). Compound 166b was found to be potent antibacterial agent against S. aureus (12 mm inhibition zone) and compound 166a was found to be more potent against S. aureus (16 mm inhibition zone). The SAR results revealed that the presence of fused pyridine ring in benzimidazole moiety as well as 4-fluorophenyl group on second position of quinoline ring has some relationship with their antibacterial activity. The presence of two chlorine atoms on benzimidazole ring along with 4-fluorophenyl group on second position of quinoline ring account for the enhanced activity of compound 166b [24] .\n\nKarthikeyan et al. have synthesized a new series of triazole substituted compounds which were acted as potent antimicrobial agents. Starting material 167 was reacted with substituted phenacyl bromides (168a-h) in the presence of base under optimal reaction conditions to yield 2-[5-(2,4-dichloro-5-fluorophenyl)-4H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl]thio-1-(substituted phenyl) ethanone (169ah) which underwent further cyclization in the presence of PPA to obtain a series of 2,4-dichloro-5-fluorophenyl containing thiazolotriazoles (170a-h) in good yields (Scheme 7). Compound 170a with triazole and chloro substituent was found to be the most active antibacterial agent (30 mm inhibition zone against P. aeruginosa) and antifungal agent (22 mm inhibition zone against A. niger) among all the synthesized series [25] .\n\nDevelopment in the area of anticancer therapeutic agents is one of the key challenges in medicinal chemistry. Cancer, a universal name for a group of diseases which characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation, is found all over the world [26] . Cancer is the second major cause of death worldwide [27] . In the year of 2014 alone, it was estimated that about 585720 Americans were died from cancer, which refers to about 1600 deaths per day [28] . According to the assessment of the world health organization (WHO), global cancer rates could increase by 50% in the year 2020, which is approximately to 15 million. Cancers of the lung and bronchus, prostate, and colorectal continue to be the most common causes of cancer death [29] .\n\nA cancer consists of a group of cells that originated from a single cell with uncontrolled growth and rapid proliferation properties [30] . Presently, a wide range of cytotoxic drugs, either alone or in combination, are used to treat cancer, and several of these drugs are in different phases of clinical trials. These cytotoxic drugs suffer from several drawbacks and are not able to differentiate between cancerous and normal cell types; consequently, they can cause serious side effects that are often cumulative and dose-limiting. The anticancer drugs in recent clinical trials exhibited unnecessary organ toxicity, lack of cell specificity, short circulating half-life, and a noticeable tendency to induce resistance in the target cells [31] . Hence, in order to save the lives of millions of people globally, continuous efforts are being made to develop effective anti-cancer drug candidates with minimal side effects and less cost. amine in triethyl amine yielded the 3-((7-chloroquinoline-4-yl) amino)propane-ol (181) according to the previous reported method [34] . Compound 181 was reacted with sulfonyl chloride in the presence of base under the optimal reaction condition to yield mesylate (182) in high yield. The intermediate 182 was treated with various substituted amino components utilizing sodium hydride as the base to afford the final N-alkylated 4-aminoquinoline derivatives (183a-n) in moderate to good yields. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their in vitro anti-breast cancer activity. Among them, compound 183a was found to be the most potent analogues against tested two cancer cell lines MDA-MB221 (GI 50 \u00bc 6.33 mM) and MCF-7 (GI 50 \u00bc 4.99 mM). The bio assays result suggests that, compound 183a analogues could serve as potent anticancer agent for the development of a new group of effective cancer chemotherapeutics [35] .\n\nBaijiao et al. have reported a simple protocol for the synthesis of quinoline containing hybrids and evaluated for their in vitro anticancer activity against different cancer cell lines. Initially, starting material dichloroquinazoline (184) was reacted with substituted selenium containing analogues (185a-d) in the presence of hydrogen chloride in isopropanol to afford the target compounds 186a-d in good yields (Scheme 11). Among them, compound 186a was found to be the most potent anticancer agent against all tested cell lines with IC 50 values ranging from 3.39 to 9.98 nM [36] .\n\nZolnowska and co-workers have reported a well-designed synthetic approach towards the synthesis of functionalized guanidine containing derivatives (189a-d) and screened for their anticancer activity. The synthetic route was outlined in Scheme 12. Initially, intermediate compounds 2-(2-arylmethylthio-4-chloro-5methylbenzenesulfonyl)-1-(4,6-dichloro-1,3,5-triazin-2-ylamino) guanidine derivatives 188a-d were synthesized from the reaction of appropriate aminoguanidine (187a-d) with 2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5triazine in the presence of triethylamine under the optimal reaction conditions. Then intermediates 187a-d were treated with various substituted amines in the presence of DIPEA as base and argon atmosphere under reflux conditions for 3e11 h to yield corresponding guanidine substituted hybrids 189a-k in good to moderate yields. Compound 189a displayed excellent inhibitory potency against hCA IX with Ki values of 41.7 nM and showed prominent cytotoxic effect with IC 50 of 17 mM against HeLa cancer cell line [37] . The SAR represented that the presence of two chlorine Scheme 9. Synthetic route of pyrazolopyrimidin derivatives as potent anticancer agents. Reagents and conditions: (i) NH 2 NH 2 $\u041dCl, MeOH, 60 C, 3 h; (ii) HCl, CH 2 Cl 2 , -2 C, 13 h; (iii) 2-amino-4,6-dichloropyrimidine-5-carbaldehyde, TEA, CH 2 Cl 2 , \u00c02 C, 13 h. Scheme 12. Synthetic route of chlorine containing drugs as potent anticancer agents. Reagents and conditions: (i) 2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-triazine, TEA, anhydrous THF, 1 h at 0 C, 2 h, rt (ii) X-NH 2 , DIPEA, 80 C, argon atmosphere, 3e11 h. electron-withdrawing groups at aromatic rings highly enhanced the anticancer activity. On the other hand, the presence of sulfonyl and sulfonamide groups also increases the anticancer activity of compound 189a.\n\nPogorzelska et al. have evaluated their synthesized compounds for anticancer activity and found effective compounds. The syntheses of new series of target compounds 192a-w was showed in Scheme 13. The starting materials 190a-l were reacted with phenylpropiolaldehyde diethyl acetal in the presence of PTSA in ethanol under reflux conditions to yield 2-(2-alkylthiobenzenesulfonyl)-3-(phenylprop-2-ynylideneamino)guanidines 191a-l in moderate to good yields. All the synthesized compounds 191a-l underwent CuI mediated electrophilic cyclizations of a, b-alkynic hydrazones, unfortunately, this step did not provided the desired derivatives but led to copper complexes with pyrazole moiety. In another way, treatment of compounds 191a-i with 20% PTSA under the optimal reaction conditions afforded the final compounds 192a-w. Magar and co-workers synthesized a series of novel benzofuran substituted hybrids and screened for their in vitro anti-proliferative activity. Usually the target compound 203 was synthesized in three simple steps. In the first step, three different chlorine-substituted pyridinium iodide salts (199) were synthesized in good yields by the heating of corresponding aryl methyl ketones (198) in the presence of iodine and pyridine at 140 C for 3 h. In the second step, Al 2 O 3 catalyzed condensation reaction was applied to prepare six aryl benzofuran-3(2H)-ones 202 by condensing benzofuran-3(2H)one (200) with aryl aldehydes 201 in methylene chloride for 3 h at room temperature. Finally, a modified Kr\u20ac ohnke pyridine synthetic method [40] was used to synthesize the target compounds 203. A mixture of aryl benzofuran-3(2H)-ones 202, pyridinium iodide salts (199) and NH 4 OAc in glacial acetic acid was heated at 100 C for 12e24 h to afford compound 203 (Scheme 15) in considerable yields. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated for in vitro topoisomerase I and II inhibition and anti-proliferative activity. Compound 203 exhibited more potent anti-proliferative activity than the positive control etoposide against HCT15 (IC 50 \u00bc 5.47 mM) and T47D (IC 50 \u00bc 7.47 mM) cell line. The SAR results suggested that, the chlorinated compounds showed better anti-proliferative activity than those of corresponding non-chlorinated compounds. The chlorination at the 2-phenyl ring is important to inhibit the topo I and II activity. These results provided useful information for the development of benzofuro[3,2-b]pyridine derivatives as a novel class of topoisomerase-targeted anticancer agents [41] .\n\nSynthesis of new class of antiproliferative agent was carried out by Yao et al. The synthetic route was lengthy and included five steps started from 2-picolinic acid 204 (Scheme 16). Compound 204 was reacted with SOCl 2 under reflux condition at 72 C for 14 h to produce 4-chloropicolinoyl chloride 205 followed by the addition of Scheme 13. Potent anticancer agents. Reagents and conditions: (i) phenylpropiolaldehyde diethyl acetal (1 eq.) or 4-phenylbut-3yn-2-one (1 eq.), PTSA (0.1 eq.),\n\nSynthetic route of chlorine containing chalcones analogues as potent antileishmanial activity. Reagents and conditions: (i) acrolein, 1,4-dioxane, K 2 CO 3 , reflux (ii) appropriate acetophenone, NaOH, EtOH (iii) methyl vinyl ketone, 1,4dioxane, K 2 CO 3 , reflux (iv) appropriate aldehyde, NaOH, EtOH. methanol at room temperature for 1 h to generate methyl 4chloropicolinate 206. Consequently, compound 206 was reacted with various substituted amines in the presence of CH 3 OH/THF at 2 C for 3 h to yield 207a-e. Then, they were treated with 4aminophenol to provide corresponding diaromatic ethers 208a-e in considerable yields. Finally, compounds 208a-e were treated with substituted diaromatic ethers 208a-e in DCM to afford the final targeted thiourea (209a-e) derivatives in considerable yields (Scheme 16). All the newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antiproliferative activities against HCT116 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. Compound 209a was found to be the most potent antiproliferative agent with IC 50 value of 9.15 mM against HCT-116 cell line [42] .\n\nZhao et al. have performed the synthesis of anti-proliferative compounds and tested their activity against four human cancer cell lines such as A549, MGC803, PC-3 and TE-1. The intermediates 211a-e were prepared by following the earlier reported procedure [43] . Then, the prepared intermediates 211a-e were treated with ethyl glyoxalate in EtOH under reflux condition for 2 h and led to the 6-chloro-2-(propylthio)-8,9-dihydro-7H-purine-8-carboxylate 212a-e in moderate yields, and then intermediates 212a-e were hydrolyzed into carboxyl in AcOH/H 2 O to yield 213a-e. Finally, compounds 213a-e were coupled with various substituted amines using coupling reagent EDCI/HOBt in dichloromethane at room temperature to afford final target compounds 214a-e (Scheme 17). Compound 214a showed excellent anti-proliferative activity with IC 50 values of 2.80 mM against A549 and 303.03 mM against GES-1, respectively. The SAR revealed that the presence of piperazine group highly enhanced the anti-proliferative activity, which suggested that the piperazine substitution was played an important role to enhance the anti-proliferative activity. The compound 214a, with a methyl substitution on the piperazine group, was found to be the most potent anti-proliferative agent in the series [44] .\n\nLuo and co-workers developed a series of novel chlorine containing compounds with enhanced in vitro anti-tumour activity. Initially, commercially available 2-amino-4-chlorobenzoic acid 215 was condensed with formamide at 140e145 C for 4. reacted with K 2 CO 3 in acetonitrile at 30e40 C for 3.5 h to yield intermediates 220. Compound 220 was reacted with substituted aldehydes in the presence of anhydrous alcohol in acetone at room temperature to provide the final target compounds 221a-e in good yields (Scheme 18). Compound 221a was found to be the most potent antitumor agent with IC 50 value of 1.96 mM against MGC-803 and 8.47 mM against Bcap-37 cell lines. Compound 221a could be considered as useful templates for the future development of more potent antitumor agents [45] .\n\nInflammation demote to localised physical conditions causing swellness, redness, heat with pain, which are mediated by the release of proinflammatory mediators like bradykinin and cytosine to increase the prostaglandin synthesis rate [46, 47] . Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which existing in two isomeric forms, namely, constitutive form (COX-1) and an inducible form (COX-2), inhibit cyclooxygenases (COX) and further inhibiting the biosynthesis of prostaglandins (PGs) [48, 49] . The role of COX-1 enzyme is to maintain the gastric integrity and kidney functioning whereas COX-2 may cause inflammation and pain [50, 51] .\n\nShantharam and co-workers have developed new series of imidazole hydrazones as potent anti-inflammatory agents. The synthesis of imidazole based hydrazones 225a-s wer performed in a manner outlined in Scheme 19. Starting material 4-(2hydroxypropan-2-yl)-2-propyl-1H-imidazole-5-carboxylic acid 222 was converted into ethylester using TMS-Cl in ethanol at room temperature followed by the addition of excess hydrazine hydrate afforded the corresponding imidazole hydrazide 224. Compound 224 was treated with various substituted aldehydes in ethanol at 80 C for 8e10 h to yield final imidazole-hydrazones 225a-s in good yields. Compound 225a was found to be the most potent antiinflammatory agent with IC 50 value of 46 mM. The SAR revealed that the presence of electron withdrawing (-Cl) groups on the phenyl ring highly enhanced the anti-inflammatory activity [52] .\n\nContinuation of their interest in drug development program, the research group of Rakesh identified the novel quinazolinone-hydrazones as potent in vitro anti-inflammatory activity. The quinazolinone starting materials 226 were methylated using TMS-Cl in methanol at room temperature followed by the addition of excess hydrazine hydrate afforded the corresponding quinazolinone hydrazides 228. The quinazolinone-hydrazones 229a-t were obtained by the reaction of 228 with different aromatic aldehydes in the presence of catalytic amount of glacial acetic acid (Scheme 20).\n\nCompounds 229a (IC 50 \u00bc 84 mM/mL) and 229b (IC 50 \u00bc 67 mM/mL) showed excellent anti-inflammatory activities with lower IC 50 values than that of the standard compound aspirin (IC 50 \u00bc 166 mM/ mL). The SAR revealed that the presence of electron withdrawing (-Cl) groups on the phenyl ring highly enhanced the antiinflammatory activity and the length of quinozolinone alkyl chain also played a major role to increases the activity. The presence of EDGs (OH and OMe) on the phenyl ring diminishes the antiinflammatory activity [53] . [54] . Cyclocondensation of compounds 231a-h with substituted aldehydes in the presence of catalytic amount of sodium acetate in acetic anhydride under the optimal reaction conditions yielded 231a-h in good yield [54] . Then, compounds 231a-h were treated with sulfanilamide in glacial acetic acid to afford the compounds 232a-h in good yields (Scheme 21). Among all the synthesized compounds, compound 232a was found to be excellent antiinflammatory activities with IC 50 of 7.86 mM against COX-1 and IC 50 of 0.86 mM against COX-2 which was more potent than that of the standard Celecoxib in the series [55] .\n\nAbdelrahman and colleagues have reported a set of thirteen quinoline-2-carboxamide derivatives from p-chloroaniline 233. Firstly, condensation of p-chloroaniline 233 with diethyl oxalpropionate 234 afforded the corresponding imine 235, which cyclized in polyphosphoric acid to yielded quinoline-2-carboxylic acid ethyl ester 236 in excellent yield. The quinoline-2-carboxylate 236 was hydrolyzed into its carboxylic acid 237 under basic conditions, which then coupled with substituted amine using BOP in the presence of DIPEA to yield quinoline-2-carboxamides 238a-m (Scheme 22). All the developed hybrids were evaluated for their in vitro anti-inflammatory activities. Compounds 238a (IC 50 \u00bc 7.9 mM against COX-1 and IC 50 \u00bc 1.21 mM against COX-2) and 238b (IC 50 \u00bc 8.6 mM against COX-1 and IC 50 \u00bc 1.13 mM against COX-2) showed excellent anti-inflammatory activity compared to the reference drug Celecoxib. The docking study explained the results obtained from the in vitro COXs assays based on the structural features and their binding patterns inside the active sites. Obviously, the two active hits 238a and 238b adopted similar binding patterns and interactions to that of the co-crystallized bromocelecoxib, S-58 ligand where the benzimidazole and phenyl piperazine moieties in 238a and 238b, respectively assumed the same position of sulfonamide moiety of S-58 within the additional side pocket of COX-2 in Fig. 2 [56] .\n\nA new series of eighteen benzo[d]imidazole-hydrazones were synthesized by Kumar et al. using commercially available compound 239 as starting material. Compound 239 was esterified by using con. H 2 SO 4 in ethanol under reflux conditions to obtain compound 240 in good yield [57] . Subsequently, compound 240 was treated with propylamine and TEA to afford compound 241. Compound 242 was prepared from nitro reductive cyclization of 241 with 2,4-dichlorobenzaldehyde using sodium dithionite in DMSO as solvent at 90 C. The one-pot reaction produced the compound 242 within 3 h in an excellent yield (94%). The ester group was then treated with hydrazine hydrate in ethanol medium under reflux condition for 6 h to provide hydrazide 243. Finally, the target hydrazones 244a-r were obtained by condensation of 243 with various substituted aldehydes in ethanol with catalytic amount of glacial acetic acid (Scheme 23). All the prepared analogues were screened for their in vitro anti-inflammatory activity. Compound 244a showed excellent anti-inflammatory activity with 71.97% inhibition compared to the reference drug indomethacin (69.34% inhibition). The SAR results revealed that, the presence of EWDs (Cl, Br and NO 2 ) on the phenyl ring increased the antiinflammatory activity and the presence of EDGs (OH and OCH 3 ) on phenyl ring reduced the anti-inflammatory activity [58] .\n\nTuberculosis is a highly infectious chronic deadly disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). This disease threatens the human life by affecting lungs primarily (pulmonary TB) distant from other vital organs. Drug-resistant TB (DR-TB), multidrugresistant TB (MDR-TB), extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) and totally drug resistant TB (TDR) emerging nowadays are completely resistant for the action of presently available standard drugs [59] . The infection of TB is so common that it has caused around 1.4 million deaths and 10.4 million clinical cases all over globe as reported in 2015 [60, 61] . However the treatment of TB with drugs such as Isoniazid (INH), Ethambutol (EMB0, Rifampicin (RIF) and Pyrazinamide (PZA) is proved to be highly effective. \n\nDiabetes is one of the insistent diseases rising in the world. According to the estimated data obtained in 2010, around 285 million peoples were suffered from diabetes all over the world and it may increase to 439 million by 2030 [69, 70] . Blood glucose changing due to the insulin resistance is regarded as the feature of being diabetic in 95% of the cases [71] which give raise to several problems like high blood pressure, heart problem, kidney failure, stroke and blindness [72] . Consequently, the inhibition of aglucosidase (EC. 3.2.1.20) , a key carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzyme, could serve as an effective methodology in both preventing and treating diabetes through controlling the postprandial glucose level and suppressing postprandial hyperglycemia [73] . a-Glucosidase specifically performs the hydrolysis of a-glucopyranoside bond, resulting in the production of a -D-glucose from the non-reducing end of the sugar [74] . Several a-glucosidase inhibitors like acarbose, voglibose, and miglitol, have appeared in clinic for the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus [75] , however, number and intensity of side effects call for the development of potent, structurally diverse, safe and efficacious drugs for the effective treatment of diabetes mellitus. a-glucosidase activity. The starting material aniline 265 was reacted with chlorosulfonyl isocyanate under the optimal reaction conditions to yield 6-chloro-substituted 3-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine 1,1-dioxide 266. Subsequent thionation of the oxo derivatives 266 with phosphorus pentasulfide in pyridine led to the corresponding compound 267. In the next step, compound 268 was prepared from the reaction of thioxo compound 267 with methyl iodide in the presence of sodium hydrogenocarbonate. Finally, compound 268 was treated with isopropyl amine under optimal reaction conditions to obtain final product 269 [77] (Scheme 28). The compound 269 was found to be the most potent glucose-induced insulin secretion with RIS value of 13 mM per 1 mM concentration. The position of the chlorine atom on the benzene ring strongly affected the activity on insulin-secreting cells. Taken as a whole, the rank order of potency of 3isopropylamino-substituted compounds on pancreatic b-cells was found to be 6-chloro \u00bc 6,7-dichloro > 7-chloro > 8-chloro > 5chloro [78] .\n\nTaha et al. have synthesized novel imidazole-pyridine hybrids and screened for their in vitro biological activities. These compounds were prepared from commercially available starting materials 5-chloropyridine-2,3-diamine 270.

All the newly \n\nMalaria refers to parasitic infection which spreads worldwide and caused serious problems in the tropical and subtropical parts of Asia, Central and South America, Africa and Middle East [80, 81] . A parasitic class called Plasmodium which carried by the female Anopheles mosquito is the cause of this disease which get entered into human bloodstream. The treatment and management of this disease is irrationally high not only because of medication but also due to low production [82] . The complexities in controlling malaria lies in growing resistance of malaria parasite to most of the antimalarial drugs are used [83] .\n\nA series of phthalazine containing imidazole derivatives with different substitution pattern have been synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro anti-malarial activity extra and intracellular forms of T. cruzi.

Compound 275 was found to be most active in vitro against extra and intracellular forms of T. cruzi (IC 50 value is 8.8 mM against epimastigote form) and less toxic against Vero cells which was better than the standard drug benznidazole. Furthermore, the study of antiparasitical activity of compound 275 was at a higher level for developing a new drug in future [84] .\n\nIn . The synthesized compounds were screened using Rane's test for blood schizonticidal activity in mice infected by P. berghei. Based on the results, three compounds possessed antimalarial activity comparable to chloroquine and compound 283 was most active one [85] .\n\nA library of novel triazines substituted hybrids have been developed by Kumar et al. and were evaluated for in vitro antimalarial activity against P. falciparum. Compound 4,7dichloroquinoline 282 was stirred with excess of 2-aminoethanol in n-butanol under optimal reaction conditions to give the 2-(7chloro-quinolin-4-ylamino)-ethanol 283 in moderate to good yield [86] . Chemoselective o-mesylation was synthesized in pyridine at 0 C for 5 h to yield themethanesulfonic acid 2-(7-chloroquinolin-4-ylamino)-ethyl ester 284 [87] . Compound 284 was subjected to nucleophilic substitution with trisubstituted triazines to yield the corresponding targeted compounds 285a-s under microwave condition (Scheme 32). Compound 285a displayed more than 99% suppression activity after four days against in-vitro model of P. falciparum and showed high 99.11% suppression against chloroquine resistant strain N-67 of P. yoelii in an in vivo assay [88] . A new series of anti-malarial active compounds has been developed by Madrid et al. [89] . A simple two-step synthesis method was used to prepare ring substituted 4-chloroquinolines derivatives 289 allowing analysis of the effect of ring substitutions on inhibition of growth of chloroquine sensitive and resistant strains of P. falciparum. The first step in the sequence was the condensation of substituted aniline 286 with Meldrum's acid and trimethylorthoformate to give eneamine 287 intermediates, which then sealed into a glass reaction tube with a small volume of phenyl ether as solvent and subjected to microwave irradiation for 5 min at 300 C (Scheme 33). The synthesized compounds were evaluated for their growth inhibition activity against P. falciparum with the help of fluorescent-active cell sorting (FACS) assay. For in vitro activity, two strains i.e. drug-sensitive and a drug-resistant were employed. Form this study it was found that substitutions with small electron withdrawing groups were found most active for anti-malarial activity.\n\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is neurodegenerative disorder featured with cognitive dysfunction and memory lapse which accounts for the major dementia cases. According to the present estimation, about 45 million people are going through this disease worldwide and it may reach up to 131 million by 2050 if the condition left untreated [90e92]. Though actual etiology for the AD progression is not known yet, a number of pathophysiology factors are believed to be responsible for the progression of this disease.\n\nDeficits of acetylcholine (Ach), inflammation, b-amyloid (Ab) deposits, oxidative stress, dyshomeostasis of biometals, tau-protein aggregation are considered to be such pathophysiological factors [93e95] . Unfortunately the medicines for the cure of AD and its progression have not been developed yet. But certain medicines were approved and prescribed for the AD patients for the temporary relief [96, 97] .\n\nWang et al. have synthesized a new series of selenium containing hydrochloride derivatives and tested for their in vitro multitarget activity against Alzheimer's disease. Firstly, Na 2 Se 2 reacted with the corresponding benzenediazonium salts, which were prepared from commercially available substituted 2-amino benzoic acids 290a-p and HNO 2 to yield 2,2-diselenobisbenzoic acids 291ap. Subsequently, SOCl 2 reacted under reflux conditions to obtain 292a-p, which then reacted with corresponding chloro substituted amines in anhydrous CH 2 Cl 2 to afford final target compounds 293ap. In final step, the Boc group was removed from compounds 293ap using HCl gas to yield de-protected hydrochloride compounds 294a-p (Scheme 34). Compound 294a showed excellent Alzheimer's disease inhibition activities against tested all multitargeted enzymes. Mainly, compound 294a was found to be the most potent Ab 1-42 aggregation agent with IC 50 value of 9.6 mM [98] .\n\nViruses are infectious agents affecting the life forms. They are responsible for various dangerous diseases like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV, respectively), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), corona viruses (Middle east respiratory Syndrome, MERS; influenza (seasonal, pandemic), viral haemorrhagic fevers (Ebola), dengue, and chikungunya etc. These diseases have caused adverse impact on human health by leading to unexpected illnesses and deaths and troubling day-to-day normal life activities. Viruses are the major cause for the emergence of newer pandemics e.g. H1N1 influenza, Ebola, and Zika virus etc. threatening the public health [99, 100] .\n\nLikewise, more than 60 antiviral drugs of diverse chemical classes have been approved by the FDA, mainly for the treatment of HIV, the hepatitis B and C, herpes and influenza A and B viruses and still many molecules are in various stages of clinical trials. But there is still a pressing need for the development of new drugs acting through several mechanisms and combat the viral resistance as viruses [101] . However it is always challenging for the medicinal chemists to develop newer drugs focus on the unique biological features of viruses and treat the emerging viral disease in one or the other way without harming the host cells [102] .\n\nIn 2012, Regina and co-workers have designed and synthesized a series of novel imidazole derivatives in a simple and single step. All synthesized derivatives were evaluated for their in vitro anti-HIV activity against MT-4 cells. Initially, carboxylic group free imidazole 295 was reacted with various substituted amines in the presence of BOP and TEA in DMF at room temperature to yield compound 296 (Scheme 35). Compound 296 exhibited the most potent anti-HIV activity against MT-4 cells with IC 50 values of 2 nM. Compound 296 emerged as a useful lead compound for the development of new therapeutic tools for EFV-based HIV-1 therapies which showed the L100I and K103 N mutations [103] . The SAR revealed that the presence of pyridine group at R position highly enhanced the activity. Moreover, the electron-withdrawing chloro group was also played a crucial role in increasing anti-HIV activity.\n\nBoland and co-workers have synthesized a novel series of potent candidate of PDE4 inhibitors in six steps. Starting from the commercially available 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde 297. Difluoromethylation of 297 in DMSO using sodium chlorodifluoroacetate as a source of difluorocarbene provided the compound 298. Alkylation of the remaining hydroxyl group of 298 was performed with alkyl dibromides to yield intermediates 299. In the next step, the aldehyde compound was oxidized into the corresponding benzoic acids 300, using sodium chlorite (Lindgren oxidation) in combination with sulfamic acid as chlorine dioxide scavenger.\n\nCompound 300 coupled with 3,5-dichloropyridin-4-amine to provide intermediates 301. Further, compound 301 underwent nucleophilic substitution with 3-amino-sulfanyldihydrofuranone to afford final compound 302 (Scheme 36). The final synthesized compounds were screened for their PDE4 inhibition activity against two PDEB1 and PDE4D2.

In the beginning, cycloalkyl-benzenes 304 reacted with the acyl-chloride in trichloroethylene under the optimal reaction conditions to provide phenones 305. Claisen condensation of 305 with imidazole-1-yl-oxo-acetic acid ethyl ester was reacted under optimal reaction condition at \u00c078 C to yield diketone esters 306 in good yields. The synthesis of acids 308 involved basic hydrolysis of the corresponding esters 307, which in turn were prepared by condensing diketone esters 306 with suitably substituted phenyl hydrazines. The intermediates 308 were then converted into their acid chlorides by using thionyl chloride in refluxing toluene and these intermediates were reacted with commercially available 1-aminopyrrolidine in dichloromethane at room temperature to afford compounds 309 (Scheme 37). Compound 309 was found to be the most potent cannabinoid Type 1 receptor antagonist with K i values of 4 nM. The SAR studies suggest that, the pyrazole substituents and the presence of chloro groups on the phenyl ring and pyrrolidine ring enhanced the activity of these novel CB1 antagonists [105] . Lan and evaluation of these series of derivatives are currently underway in their laboratory and will be reported in due course [106] . In 2016, Cao and co-workers have designed and synthesized a new series of pyridazinone substituted analogues and evaluated for their in vitro antineuropathic pain activity.

In the first step, 1-indanone 326 was condensed with aryl aldehydes 327 to prepare indanone intermediates 328 in the presence of 5% aqueous NaOH in ethanol using Claisen-Schmidt condensation reaction [110] . Then, six pyridinium iodide salts 330 were synthesized by refluxing acetophenones 329 with iodine in pyridine. Finally, using modified Kr\u20ac ohnke synthesis [111] , indanone intermediates 328 and pyridinium iodide salts 330 were reacted in the presence of dry ammonium acetate in methanol or acetic acid to yield compounds 331a-e in the moderate yields (Scheme 42). All the synthesized eighteen new chlorinated compounds were assessed for topoisomerase inhibitory activity and cytotoxicity against HCT15, T47D, and HeLa cancer cell lines. Among them, compounds 331a (IC 50 \u00bc 0.05 nM against HCT-15 and IC 50 \u00bc 1.08 nM against T47D cell lines) and 331b (IC 50 \u00bc 0.11 nM against HCT-15 and IC 50 \u00bc 1.16 nM against T47D cell lines) showed the most potent topoisomerase activity which is better than the reference drugs. All of the chlorinated compounds displayed significant cytotoxic effect, revealing potent anticancer activity against T47D breast cancer cells [112] .\n\nSynthesis of new class of acaricidal and insecticidal agents was carried out by Kadayat and co-workers.

Further, the compound 333 was reacted with hydroxylamine hydrochloride in methanol or ethanol medium to yield compound 5aryloxy pyrazole oximes 334 in good yields. The treatment of intermediate 334 with 2-chloromethyl-5-alkoxy-1,3,4-thiadiazole in acetonitrile medium using potassium carbonate as alkali produced corresponding pyrazole oximes containing a substituted 1,3,4thiadiazole moiety 335a-z (Scheme 43). All the newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their in vitro acaricidal and insecticidal activities. Compound 335a showed the most potent insecticidal activities against P. xylostella with LC 50 value of 9.78 mM which was better than the control compound Pyridalyl (LC 50 \u00bc 17.40 mM) [114] .\n\nVery recently, Taha and co-workers have developed a novel class of indole derivatives as potent a-amylase inhibition agent. The synthetic route was very simple and it included only two steps.

All the synthesized compounds were tested for their a-amylase inhibitory activity. Compounds 338a and 338b displayed the most potent a-amylase inhibitory activity with IC 50 values of 2.10 mM and 2.03 mM respectively. The SAR revealed that the presence of electron withdrawing groups (Cl and F) on the phenyl ring highly enhanced the a-amylase activity. Compounds having substituents on para-position are more active than their ortho and meta counterpart [115] .\n\nChourey and co-workers have designed and synthesized a novel eicosatetraenoic acid as potent OXE receptor agent. Chloro substituted indole analog 339 was reacted with (R)-methyl 5chloro-3-methyl-5-oxopentanoate under optimal reaction conditions to obtain intermediate 340 in very good yield.

Additionally, we hope that the synthetic organic chemistry researchers could improve the ways to synthesize potent chlorine-based drugs as well as underrepresented and nonexistent drugs. In this review, we mainly focused on the synthesis of chlorinated drugs, chlorinated drugs as a function of approval date, disease condition, chlorine attachment and structure-activity relationship. We believe that this review article will be useful for inspiring the structural design and developments of less toxic and powerful chlorine-based drugs against the numerous deathcausing diseases."}
