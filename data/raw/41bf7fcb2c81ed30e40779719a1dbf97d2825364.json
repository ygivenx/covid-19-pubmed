Are we different, like Europe?", "body": "Abstract.\n\nThe infection by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has taken the dimension of a pandemic, affecting more than 160 countries in a few weeks. In Colombia, despite the implementation of the rules established by the national government, exists an elevate concern both for mortality and for the limited capacity of the health system to respond effectively to the needs of patients infected.\n\nFor Colombia, assuming a case fatality rate among people infected with SARS-CoV-2 of 0.6% (average data from the information reported for Latin American countries for March 18) (Table 1) , the number of deaths, in one or two weeks, could be 16 and 243, respectively. These estimates differ markedly from those documented in countries such as Spain and Italy, in which COVID-19 case fatality rates exceed 8% (case of Italy) and from the percentage of patients who have required intensive care, which has ranged from 9% to 11% of patients in Mediterranean European countries. These differences could be explained due to: a) the percentage of the population at risk (individuals older than 60 years); b) a higher epidemiological exposure to viral respiratory infections associated with more frequent exposure to them, due to geographic and climatic conditions; c) less spread of the virus by location in the tropical zone; and d) earlier preventive measures to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, it is possible to establish that the situation in this country will be different from in European Mediterranean and that Colombia could have different endpoints from Spain and Italy.\n\nThe infection by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has taken the dimension of a pandemic, affecting more than 160 countries in a few weeks. In China, although containment measures have significantly reduced new cases of COVID-19, in other countries, this reduction has not been similar. In Colombia, despite the implementation of the rules established by the national government, exists an elevate concern both for mortality and for the limited capacity of the health system to respond effectively to the needs of patients infected and requiring intensive care by the respiratory complications associated with this infection. 1 The data collected so far on the number of infected people and the evolution of the epidemic are imprecise. Even though to date in Colombia (March 19, 2020) there are no deaths yet, nor patients in intensive care by COVID-19, the diagnoses of infection by SARS-CoV-2 have increased ( Figure 1 ). In this country, since the first case was reported (March 6, 2020), the number of infected patients follows an exponential trend, like other countries in the region, except Ecuador, with a lower incidence. If this trend continues, in a week (until March 26, 2020) or two (April 2, 2020), there will be 2,581 and 40,535 infected patients, respectively, as shown in Figure 2 . 1, 2 According with the Knowledge of this infection so far, the high-risk age groups are among the people over 60 years of age, primarily due to the burden of disease and the complications that this infection generates in them. Regarding to the current COVID-19 data available from Colombia, the proportion of patients in that age group is 15%, and of them, 4.7% needing hospitalizing, proportion which is lower than in other age groups. Additionally, as of March 19, most cases are imported (64%). 3 in Argentina after the 12th day of the first case was diagnosed, and in Panama was the first death 4 was reported after the sixth day. This situation differs from European countries, where COVID-19 associated deaths started until after the 23rd of the first diagnosis (France). Additionally, the reports curve of some European countries has a slower start compared to Latin American countries. This situation may be due to a higher degree of alertness in this region, motivated by the experiences of European and Asian countries, leading to earlier diagnostic tests (early detection).\n\nAdditionally, in Europe, at the beginning of the infection, the diagnoses were oriented to people with symptoms.\n\nThe ability of the health system to detect the SARS-CoV-2 infection is a factor that can influence the diagnosis and reporting of cases. By March 18, 2020, Italy had already carried out 148,657 tests (31,506 -21.2% -positive), South Korea: 286,716 (8,320 -2.9% -positive), and Colombia: 2,571 tests (93 -3.6% -positive). Although the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests performed should be like the number of people tested, the values may differ because some people need a duplicate of the test. The reason for this is that there are \"false negative\" results. 4 However, the ability of a health system to perform these tests greatly influences the case fatality rate, as the denominator determines its value. Therefore, conducting random tests in the people infected with symptoms or disease decrease in the case fatality rate. In China, where they have done a random SARS-CoV-2 screening, the severity of the infection has shown that: 80% of the cases present mild symptoms, 15% severe, and 5% critical. For its part, in Spain, the behavior is more worrying (60% mild, 30% will require hospitalization, and 10% intensive care). 5 For Colombia, assuming a case fatality rate among people infected with SARS-CoV-2 of 0.6% (average data from the information reported for Latin American countries for March 18) (Table 1) , the number of deaths, in one or two weeks, could be 16 and 243, respectively. These estimates differ markedly from those documented in countries such as Spain and Italy, in which COVID-19 5 case fatality rates exceed 8% (case of Italy) and from the percentage of patients who have required intensive care, which has ranged from 9% to 11% of patients in Mediterranean European countries. Differences could be explained due to: a) the percentage of the population at risk (individuals older than 60 years); b) a higher epidemiological exposure to viral respiratory infections associated with more frequent exposure to them, due to geographic and climatic conditions; c) less spread of the virus by location in the tropical zone; and d) earlier preventive measures to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. \n\nIn Colombia, the proportion of people aged 60 is 13%, while in Italy 29% and Spain 25% ( Figure   3 ). Therefore, it is plausible to think that, compared to Italy (the country with the highest fatality rate due to the coronavirus), the incidence of fatal cases in Colombia would be lower due to the lower proportion of high-risk people. \n\nWithin the actions taken to suppress transmission of SARS-CoV-2, Colombia closed universities and colleges to decrease the spread of this virus. Table 2 (Table 2) . Predictions of COVID -19 evolution for Colombia, based on its behavior observed in Italy and Spain are very fearful, because they imply that this country lacks the response capability required for caring of all the patients who could become infected and, especially, for patients who will require admission to intensive care units. Therefore, there is a widespread fear of the high impact on morbidity, mortality and social costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Colombia. However, it is possible to establish that the situation in this country will be different from in European\n\nMediterranean. Some differences support this hypothesis in favor of Colombia, such as: a) a lower percentage of the population at risk (by age); b) a possible better immunological capacity (due to the greater exposure to outbreaks of respiratory infections during the year); c) the characteristics 11 of tropical regions that reduces the speed of virus transmission, and d) earlier implementation of preventive health policies. Finally, it is essential to highlight the difference between being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and presenting the COVID-19; in Colombia, as of March 19, 2020, only 8% of the patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 required hospitalization, and no patients have required intensive care unit (Figure 1 )."}
