{"title": "", "body": "where community spread is ongoing, is that the arrival of spring and summer will reduce transmission of this respiratory virus. Intuitively, one hemisphere's fortune is likely to be the other's misfortune. As the southern hemisphere moves from summer to autumn and swiftly into winter, the transmission of all respiratory viruses will increase, including SARS-CoV-2 if introduced into that country. How can LMICs mitigate the impact of such an introduction into their health systems?\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is highlighting the importance of infection prevention in controlling the spread of this and other pathogens. Despite reports of the first vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 entering phase I trials (Park, 2020) , the time to rollout, should the vaccine show successful results, will not be able to mitigate the impact of a major outbreak in the southern hemisphere this winter. However, other vaccines that could reduce primary care consultations, hospital admissions, and morbidity and mortality from respiratory infections are available to us but are historically under-utilized. themselves against influenza differ depending on age, gender, and role within the healthcare workforce. For example, in one study, male HCWs and those of older age were more likely to be vaccinated, whereas being a nurse correlated with reduced vaccine uptake (Bish 2011) . The desire of HCWs to protect themselves, family and friends rather than protect patients was an important positive factor towards uptake in some studies (Bish J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f protect the integrity of the healthcare system will work in the midst of a southern hemisphere SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is an unknown quantity. Finding the right messaging to drive high uptake will be critical, and a case for careful study. "}
