{"title": "Sensitive and Specific Detection of Low- Level Antibody Responses in Mild Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infections Serum Samples", "body": "encoding sequence into the pFastbac transfer vector (Invitrogen, https://www.thermofisher.com) in-frame between honeybee melittin (HBM) secretion signal peptide and a triple StrepTag purification tag. We produced acmid DNA and recombinant baculovirus according to protocols from the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen). We expressed MERS-CoV S2 protein in Sf-9 cells after infection with the recombinant baculovirus. We harvested recombinant S2 from cell culture supernatants 3 days postinfection and purified it using StrepTactin sepharose affinity chromatography (IBA, https://www.iba-lifesciences.com). The protein was used to coat ELISA plates.\n\nPRNT was used as a reference for this study, because it is the standard for MERS-CoV serology. We tested serum samples for their neutralization capacity against MERS-CoV (Erasmus MC isolate) by plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) using Huh-7 cells in a 96well plate format. Heat-inactivated samples were 2-fold serially diluted (1:20 up to 1:2560) in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and 1% fetal bovine serum, starting at a dilution of 1:10 in 50 \u03bcL. We added 50 \u03bcL of the virus suspension to each well (500 TCID50) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. Following incubation, we transferred the mixtures (virus and serum) on Huh-7 cells cultured in 96-well plates and incubated them at 37\u00b0C for 8 h. We then fixed the cells and stained them with immunofluorescent staining. The serum neutralization titer is the reciprocal of the highest dilution resulting in an infection reduction of >90% (PRNT90). A titer of >20 was considered to be positive.\n\nWe performed MERS-CoV IgG S1 ELISA using a commercial kit (Euroimmun, https://www.euroimmun.com) and performed the assay according to manufacturer's protocol.\n\nThe optical density (OD) was measured at 450 nm, and a ratio of the reading of each sample to the reading of the calibrator, included in the kit, was calculated for each sample (OD ratio).\n\nAccording to the manufacturer's guidelines, samples with an OD ratio <0.8 were considered negative, those with an OD ratio >1.1 were considered positive, whereas those in between were considered borderline.\n\nWe performed inhouse S1 ELISA by coating 96-well microtiter ELISA plates with MERS-CoV S1 protein (1 \u03bcg/mL) in PBS overnight at 4\u00b0C. Following blocking, diluted serum (1:100 or 2-fold serially diluted [1:100-1:12800] for titers) were added and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1h. Bound antibodies were detected using peroxidase-labeled rabbit anti-human IgG (Dako, https://www.agilent.com) and TMB as a substrate. The absorbance of each sample was measured at 450 nm. We set a cutoff at 0.5, which is >6 standard deviations above the mean value of the negative respiratory cohort (0.46). Serum titers correspond to the reciprocal of the highest dilution giving a signal above the cutoff. We tested all samples twice in 2 independent assays. Page 4 of 9\n\nWe diluted serum 4-fold (1:20 to 1:1280) and tested using an HCoV S1 protein microarray as previously described (6); including S1 domains of the 6 known HCoVs. We set a cutoff was set at 30,000 relative fluorescent units and determined serum titers as the reciprocal of the serum dilution corresponding to the EC50 of each serum sample interpolated from a concentration-response curve (7) .\n\nAnti-nucleocapsid antibody responses were tested using a luciferase immunoprecipitation assay (LIPS). The N protein was expressed in HEK-293T cells as an N terminal Renilla luciferase (Ruc)-tagged protein (Ruc-N) using pREN2 expression vector kindly provided by Dr. suspension of UltraLink protein A/G beads and reincubated under the same conditions for 1 more hour. After that, the wells were washed 8 times with buffer A and twice with PBS and luminescence was measured for each well after adding 100\u03bcL of 0.1 \u03bcM coelenterazine (Nanolight Technology, www.nanolight.com) in assay buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). We tested serum samples in duplicates in >2 independent assays and averaged the data to determine the LU value for each sample. A cutoff was set at 30,000 LU.\n\nPage 5 of 9\n\nWe conducted MERS-CoV IgG S2 ELISA following the same protocol used for the inhouse S1 ELISA. A cutoff was set at 0.72, which is equal to 6 standard deviations above the mean value of the negative cohorts. *Red type indicates serum samples that tested negative in each assay.
