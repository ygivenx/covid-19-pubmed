{"title": "", "body": "Tourism and Terrorism Terrorism has become a major issue in tourism since the sequence of terrorist attacks which began in the USA on 11 September 2001 which had a massive impact on the tourist industry.\n\nHowever, before we begin to consider the effects of terrorism on tourism we need to make a few points by way of background.\n\nFirstly, the term 'terrorism' is highly subjective. One person's 'terrorist' is another person's 'freedom fighter'. For example, the Resistance Fighters of Europe in World War II, fighting the Nazis were seen as heroes even though they carried out 'terrorist' type attacks on the Germans. Furthermore, some people accuse governments, sometimes, as acting like terrorists, in the way they deal with opposition and their enemies. 'Terrorists' tend to be people on the opposite side of an argument who use violence to try and get their way.\n\nSecondly, terrorism is not new. It has a history which goes back centuries. In some places, terrorism has been a fact of life for decades.\n\nIn the past, tourists were sometimes victims of terrorism but usually they were not specifically targeted; they were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. For example, in Northern Ireland, very rarely were tourists killed or wounded by terrorist action. However, in the past decade or so, terrorist groups have started to deliberately target tourists specifically.\n\nAttacking tourists has distinct advantages for terrorist groups as follows:\n\n\u2022 Attacking foreign tourists, who will usually be from the so-called developed countries, guarantees the terrorist group publicity for its cause in the tourist's own country. \u2022 Given that many economies rely heavily on tourism, attacks on tourists can harm the tourism industry, thus damaging the economy and undermining the government. \u2022 By attacking foreign tourists rather than the indigenous population, the terrorist group does not risk losing the support of the latter which can be very important. \u2022 Foreign tourists often behave in ways which local opinion in the destination, and the terrorist groups themselves, find unacceptable. Thus these groups can see them as 'legitimate' targets because of their behaviour.\n\nThere have also been plots to attack tourists which were foiled by security services such as in Jordan in 2000 when a plan to attack tourists in Amman was uncovered and defeated. In general, there are ways in which terrorist attacks have an impact on tourism, namely, where 1. tourists are deliberately targeted in their destination; 2. tourists are deliberately targeted in the transition or travel zone such as attacks on airlines or airports; 3. tourists are not targeted but become victims by accident; 4. tourists are not injured in an attack but where the publicity given to the attack damages tourism to the destination where the attack took place.\n\nLet us now look at three major recent attacks and their link to tourism.\n\nThis tragic attack on the World Trade Centre was not, of course, aimed at tourists. However, by using civil airliners as their weapon, the terrorists made people frightened to travel by air. This clearly had great implications for the tourism industry, given its reliance on air travel, and was disastrous for the airline industry in the USA.\n\nOn 12 October, a massive bomb at the Sari nightclub in the Bali resort of Kuta killed nearly 200 people. There are suggestions that the terrorists targeted a nightclub because of its association with party tourism of which the terrorists and some local people disapproved. Nearly half the victims were Australians. Bali has always been a party destination for young Australians. However, it is important to recognize that Indonesians and people from 20 other countries were also killed. This shows the cosmopolitan nature of the market in many modern destinations. Interestingly, while Indonesia is 85 per cent Muslim, Bali is largely Hindu in religious persuasion. Perhaps the terrorists, who it is assumed were allies of Al-Qaeda would prefer to perpetrate an attack in a place where the population is not followers of the same religion as themselves.\n\nTerrorists attacked the Israeli-owned Paradise Hotel in Mombasa, Kenya. They destroyed the hotel and 12 people died. It was clear that the tourists were deliberately targeted because they were Israeli, by people who are anti-Israeli, particularly as a result of the situation in Palestine. While the media focused on the targeting of Israeli tourists, it is important to note that the majority of the dead -nine -were Kenyan hotel workers. A BBC web site news story on 5 December 2002 noted that the Kenyan workers were now unemployed and had not been paid what they were owed.\n\nInterestingly, the same day, terrorists tried to attack by missiles, an Israeli passenger jet after it left Mombassa airport.\n\nThis attack also focused attention on hotels which generally have had few if any security precautions to protect guests, unlike airports with their X-raying of baggage, and screening of travellers. Hotels were shown to be very vulnerable soft targets.\n\nBefore we look at the effects which terrorism has on tourism we need to make two brief, but important points, as follows:\n\n1. Terrorism affects local populations and non-tourists in general, much more than tourists in most attacks. 2. Tourists are also affected by other threats to their lives including disease epidemics wars, civil unrest, and crime. For example, in 1995 Robinson and Marlow noted that nine tourists were killed in 1992-1993 by robbers in Florida.\n\nWhen attacks on tourists by terrorists do take place, they have a number of interrelated effects whereby tourism demand falls from specific national markets, or the market in general. This can affect a particular destination or it can be more general. This then reduces income and profitability for tourism organizations which, in turn, weakens national economies. We will now look at some of the effects of terrorist attacks in detail:\n\n\u2022 Until the peace process succeeded, the well-publicized 'troubles' in Northern Ireland prevented the rise of tourism in the region, even though tourists were not deliberately targeted and the country is beautiful. \u2022 Attacks on tourists in Egypt in 1991/1992 led to a fall in tourist revenue from $2.1 to $1.3 billion between 1992 and 1993 (Robinson and Marlow, 1995 . \u2022 Kurdish attacks in Turkey in 1992-1993 caused a 30 per cent reduction in holiday bookings in 1994 (Robinson and Marlow, 1995) .\n\nHowever, 11 September 2001, which ironically was not targeted at tourists, has had the greatest impact on tourism, and on tourist confidence in general. Its effects have included the following:\n\n1. The airline business, particularly on routes across the Atlantic, and within the USA, was drastically affected, causing airlines to adopt immediate drastic measures including the following: -US Airways cut 11,000 jobs and slashed its schedule by 23 per cent.\n\n-Continental cut 12,000 staff, reduced its schedule by 20 per cent and postponed the flotation of its ExpressJet unit. -United Airlines, Delta, Air Canada, American Airlines, and American Air Trans all cut schedules by 20 per cent. -Midwest Airways said it would abandon financial restructuring and proceed with bankruptcy immediately. -British transatlantic carrier Virgin Atlantic shed 1200 jobs. -Dutch KLM and Spain's Iberia both warned the attacks could lead them to report losses. -German Lufthansa cut three of its Transatlantic routes. -Irish airline Aer Lungus announced that it was to cut its operations by 25 per cent and would let go more than 600 temporary staff. -Air France said it was freezing hiring and retiring 17 planes from service. Transatlantic and domestic air travel fell by between 30 and 50 per cent. As a result the US government actually gave emergency financial aid to airlines in the USA. This was very controversial as many commentators believed that the airlines were in trouble before 11 September and cynically exploited the events of 11 September to gain government help. For example, a BBC study in January 2001, told of the woes facing American Airlines and US Airways under the heading, 'US airline profits fell to earth'. The downturn in the US airline market was due to the economic recession in the USA, even before 11 September. Of course, these events worsened an already bad situation. The aid for American airlines was also resented by airlines in other parts of the world where they were adversely affected by the attacks, but did not receive any aid.\n\nIt is interesting to note that certain airlines in Europe, notably 'budget' carriers like Ryanair and easyJet actually increased their passenger numbers during the time of this crisis. 2. Destinations suffered enormously and not just the USA. For example, the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTC) estimated that the events of 11 September in New York cost the Caribbean a fall of 13.5 per cent in visitors with a resulting loss of 365,000 jobs.\n\nDestinations that rely heavily on US tourists have generally suffered heavily from the reduction in travel by Americans.\n\nIn 2002, in spite of the 11 September attacks, the European Travel Commission (ETC) noted that visitor arrivals in Europe, overall, were down only 0.7 per cent on 2001. However, they noted that tourist arrivals from the USA fell by the following amounts in the regions of Europe:\n\nIn October 2001 the UK government anticipated that the 11 September and its aftermath would cost the UK tourism industry up to \u00a316 million over just 3 months (BTA, 2001) .\n\nBut the greatest effects were of course felt in the USA. In the early days after the 11 September attacks, the statistics showed they had had a drastic effect on tourism in the USA. This led many to predict a dire future for the industry in the USA. The seriousness of the situation, as perceived a few weeks after the events, is illustrated by the following results of a World Travel and Tourism Council 'Roundtable' in October 2001:\n\n-17 per cent in Western Europe, including the UK, France and Ireland; -14 per cent in Eastern Europe; -10 per cent in Central Europe, including Germany, Austria, and Switzerland; -8 per cent in Northern Europe, in other words, Scandinavia. -One estimate states the US economy will decrease by 1.8 per cent of total GDP, a loss of 1.1 million jobs.\n\nThe events of 11 September had an enormous impact on tourist confidence, which may have long-term implications for the tourism industry. This point is demonstrated by the result of research conducted in the UK by the English Tourism Council in October 2001, including the following:\n\nThe Bali and Kenya bombings in 2002 also had very serious impacts on the tourist industry, although these effects have generally been confined to the destinations themselves rather than being more widely felt. The fact that the recent terrorist attacks have had such a great impact on tourism is because \u2022 they have been on a large scale and have been seen almost all over the world;\n\n\u2022 they are not seen as 'one-off' events but rather as part of an ongoing series of attacks with no one knowing where or when the next will take place; \u2022 it has taken place at the same time as an economic downturn. Due to these factors we have seen no rapid recovery after the terrorist attacks. Egypt, where 58 tourists were killed in 1997 suffered a short-term fall in volume but by 1999 tourist arrivals were more than 20 per cent better than before the attack.\n\nThe larger the scale of the attack and the greater the media coverage, the deeper the impact, and the greater the need for action by the tourism industry to kick-start demand.\n\nOne in ten adults (10 per cent) say that their plans to take leisure trips between now and the end of December 2001 have been affected by the terrorism crisis. This translates into over 4 million people changing their plans.\n\nThose who have changed their plans are mainly:\n\n\u2022 holding off until the situation is clearer (mentioned by 48 per cent -around 2 million people); \u2022 postponing trips (28 per cent -over 1 million people); \u2022 cancelling trips (15 per cent -around three-quarters of a million people); \u2022 switching from taking a trip abroad to taking a trip in the UK (19 per cent -almost 1 million people).\n\nPeople changing their plans has mainly affected:\n\n\u2022 Trips abroad (84 per cent -over 3 million people have changed plans for trips abroad).\n\n\u2022 Holidays of 4 nights or more (51 per cent -over 2 million people) rather than short breaks (24 per cent -about 1 million people) and visiting friends and relatives (23 per cent -also around 1 million).\n\nChanges in plans for business are mainly cancellations (36 per cent of those changing plans) postponements (40 per cent) and holding off until the situation is clearer (43 per cent) -each of these affecting around half a million business travellers. And the changes mainly affect trips abroad (68 per cent) than trips in the UK (30 per cent).\n\nOne in ten of those working (10 per cent -around 3 million people) say that their company does not allow employees to go on business trips abroad at the moment. This is roughly twice the level for business trips in the UK (5 per cent).\n\nAround four in 10 say that they might take a holiday or short break before the end of the year, but they will wait for the moment. This group represents about 18 million people, and they are fairly evenly spread across all demographic groups and parts of the country.\n\nSource: www.swtourism.co.uk\n\nThe terrorist attacks in New York, Bali, and Kenya, and the rapid drop in tourism demand have led to a number of difficult responses from the tourism industry and governments, as follows:\n\n\u2022 Airlines have rationalized and reduced capacity, laid off staff, and tried to kick-start demand with low fares. \u2022 Tour operators have had to reduce capacity or even eliminate some destinations which their customers might consider to be risky. \u2022 Destinations have tried to use promotion to re-establish tourist interest in them. \u2022 Hotels, airports, and airlines have started to upgrade their security arrangements. At the same time, governments have felt obliged to offer more advice to tourists on the terrorist risks in particular destinations. This advice is becoming very cautious particularly after claims that tourists were not influenced by known threats to tourists in Indonesia and Kenya before the attacks in 2002.\n\nAfter 11 September, a wide range of destinations launched 'recovery plans' including many outside the UK. For example, in Ireland, the Shannon and west of Ireland Task Force launched a \u20ac1.5 million promotional campaign to help the area recover from the adverse affects on its tourism by the UK foot and mouth crisis and the 11 September attacks.\n\nSupra-governmental organizations also held meetings and conferences to discuss recovery strategies for the global tourism industry. One such event took place in Madrid in January 2003, organized by the World Tourism Organization (WTO), with the following aim:\n\nOutside the USA, at least, a moderate recovery appeared to be underway by early 2002. In spite of the terrorist attacks in Bali and Kenya, however, the WTO reported, in February 2003, that international tourist arrivals rose by around 3 per cent between 2001 and 2002. North-East Asia achieved 12 per cent growth, 11 per cent was in the Middle East, South-East Asia achieved a little less than 4 per cent growth.\n\nPublic-private co-operation after 11 September and the current tourism situation: recovery strategies During this time of uncertainty in world tourism resulting from the combined effects of terrorism and the economic downturn, the WTO Business Council proposes an opportunity to reflect on the situation and take stock of the recovery strategies implemented in the different regions and countries.\n\nLet us do so within the framework of co-operation -not confrontation -between the public and private sectors. Such co-operation is a necessary condition for competitiveness and is thus a key objective of the Business Council. In the wake of 11 September, co-operation between the public and private sectors reached an unprecedented degree of cohesion in the design and execution of strategies in response to a scenario that was very different from past crises.\n\nRepresentatives from the public sector of three countries (Spain, Costa Rica, and Chile) will present their particular experiences in order to illustrate this co-operation, as well as recovery strategies and the current tourism situation. Furthermore, three associations that are highly representative of the private sector will discuss the determining factors affecting three especially sensitive areas of the world: the US, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nSecretary-General of the WTO, Mr Thungialli, took comfort from these statistics and said:\n\nThen came the outbreak of war in Iraq and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, and again, the future of global tourism looked problematic.\n\nMany governments now offer comprehensive advice to their citizens covering all potential risks in destinations. They are often accused of being over-cautious because governments do not want to be criticized for not warning tourists of risks, if anything ultimately happens to their nationals.\n\nA good example of such government advice is the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in the UK. In January 2003, they were giving this advice in relation to the following five countries:\n\nWe can be relatively satisfied with the year 2002 and cautiously optimistic about the development of 2003 (The WTO Security General). The statistics did meet our expectations, in some parts of the world they even exceeded them, however, we should not forget that the threats are anything but over. ' We have a lot of work to do to reaffirm positive trends, but first of all, to regain consumer confidence where needed. World tourism has never before felt such a need for co-operation as now', the Secretary-General points out. 'Taking all the problems into account, we can all be certain that tourism is firmly on the way to recovery, back to the trends predicted in Tourism 2020 Vision', says Mr Frangialli.\n\nWe believe that Kenya is one of a number of countries in East Africa where there may be an increased terrorist threat. UK nationals in Kenya should be vigilant, particularly in public places frequented by foreigners such as hotels, restaurants, nightclubs, and shopping malls. In particular there is a potential threat against Western interests in Nairobi. Britons in remote areas or border regions could also be targets of attacks or kidnappings.\n\nFollowing a specific threat to the British High Commission in Nairobi, the High Commission was closed on 5 December 2002. It reopened on 9 December 2002.\n\nIn a terrorist attack in Kuwait on 21 January, two US nationals working for the US military were shot. One was killed and the other seriously injured. A terrorist incident also took place on 8 October 2002, on the Kuwaiti Island of Failaka, in which one US marine and two Kuwaiti assailants were killed in an exchange of fire. On 21 November 2002, two US soldiers were injured in a shooting incident while travelling to a military camp.\n\nAlthough no incidents have occurred which directly affected British nationals, we believe that Kuwait, in common with all the Gulf region and many other countries, is a place where there is an increased threat to visible British institutions and organizations from global terrorism. Given the heightened tension in the Middle East region and the increased threat from global terrorism, you should be vigilant, particularly in public places frequented by foreigners such as hotels, restaurants, and shopping malls, and exercise good security practice.\n\nWe continue to assess that the threat to British nationals and British interests from terrorism throughout Indonesia remains high. British nationals who choose to remain in Indonesia should exercise extreme caution in public places of entertainment such as nightclubs, bars, restaurants, shopping malls, outdoor recreational areas, and places of worship. British nationals should be particularly careful throughout Java and Bali, and in cultural and tourist locations in other islands. All British institutions and businesses should keep their security arrangements tight, and under very regular review. We have been warning about threats to British and International schools. Information received in November 2002 about Jakarta underlined those concerns, British and International schools remain extremely vigilant.\n\nOn 17 December 2002, the Spanish police foiled an apparent attempt to bring explosives for later use into Madrid, when the suspect vehicle and its occupants were apprehended on a motorway north of the city. Police sources were subsequently quoted as saying that the explosives were destined for five large bombs to be placed and detonated in various Madrid shopping centres on New Year's Eve. This attempt followed the car bomb explosion in Santander for which a warning was received and in which no one was injured. These incidents followed a series of bombings during the summer of 2002 in resorts on the Costa Blanca and the Costa del Sol and other cities in Spain. These attacks followed the threat made by ETA in March 2001 that, to further its aim of damaging the Spanish economy, it would attack tourists to stay away from Spanish resorts. A number of embassies in Madrid have received a letter, purporting to come from ETA, which states that ETA remains strongly determined that tourist facilities will continue to be targets during 2003, and again warns tourists to stay away from the Spanish resorts or risk involvement in their actions.\n\nIn the summer of 2001 too, ETA carried out a number of mostly car bomb attacks in resorts on the east coast, and at Madrid and Malaga airports. In most cases, warnings were given and there were few casualties. The high-speed rail link between Madrid and Seville was briefly disrupted, and there was some minor evidence of planning against ferries operating between the UK and northern Spain.\n\nDuring the autumn and winter, ETA attacks -shootings and car bombings -continued, though their number decreased. The main targets continued to be Spanish politicians, members of the security forces, judges, and journalists. But a car bomb in Madrid in May (near a major football stadium before a big match) was apparently aimed more at maximizing public impact.\n\nIn mid-May, the security authorities arrested two ETA terrorists in Madrid with bomb making equipment.\n\nDespite the recent bombs on the Costas and in other parts of Spain statistically your chances of being caught in a terrorist outrage remain very low. But, given the many millions of foreign tourists who visit Spain each year, there will always be the chance of visitors becoming caught up in any further attacks in tourist areas by literally being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nIf further incidents take place, tourists can expect disruptions from real or hoax terrorist attempts. Visitors should follow the instructions of the local police and other authorities.\n\nOn 5 December, the US authorities issued an advisory stating American citizens should be particularly cautious if they travel into or out of Gaziantep airport. The airport in Gaziantep is being used as an alternative airport while the runway at the airport in Adana is under repair.\n\nHowever, many destination governments, particularly in poorer countries, are very worried that this advice will destroy their tourism industries and damage their economies. Their views were reported on the BBC news worldwide on 4 November 2002, as follows:\n\nThe 'war on terrorism' and tourism\n\nAt the time of writing -April 2003 -the USA and the UK are waging what they describe as a 'war on terrorism' and are at war with Iraq. If this war on terrorism continues it will, inevitably, also have a serious impact on tourism. Tourists fear that any war initiated by the USA, UK, and their allies will stimulate further terrorist attacks, continuing the spiral of terror.\n\nVisitors should be aware that there have been occasional politically motivated acts of violence, sometimes causing casualties. These may continue, on a small scale. But we do not at present see them as a deterrent to tourists visiting Turkey.\n\nTravellers to south-east Turkey should exercise caution, keep to main roads and towns, and avoid travel at dusk or after dark.\n\nBomb attacks targeted primarily against the security authorities, sometimes occur in Istanbul. On 10 September 2001, a bomb attack in Istanbul's Taksim area killed two Turkish policemen and an Australian tourist. More recently, there have been some incidents involving small explosive devices, but there were not deaths as a result. : www.fco.gov.uk, 24 January 2003 South-east Asian states have appealed to the rest of the world to stop warning travellers against going to their region because of fears of terrorism.\n\nThe call came as a 2-day summit of the 10 member-states of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh got underway.\n\nThe leaders criticized Western government for their recent spate of travel warnings against visiting many parts of the region.\n\n'We call on the international community to avoid indiscriminately advising their citizens to refrain from visiting \u2026 our countries, in the absence of established evidence to substantiate rumours of possible terrorist attacks' the statement said.\n\nThe BBC's Jonathan Head in Phnom Penh says tourism -a multi-billion dollar industry in the Asean countries -is facing a deep crisis.\n\nHe says that even before the Bali bomb, visitor numbers had already fallen sharply in parts of Philippines and Indonesia because of increasing lawlessness.\n\nASEAN: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore, and Vietnam Our correspondent says that now -as tourism has collapsed in Bali as well -the Asean leaders are trying to dispel the perception that the region is unsafe.\n\nThe leaders also deplored what they called a trend towards identifying attacks with particular religious or ethnic groups.\n\nThe Asean Secretary-General pointed out that the discovery of terrorist cells in European countries did not result in tourists being warned away there.\n\nIn terms of the current 'war' in Iraq, the industry remembers the Gulf War which led to a fall in tourist trips in 1992 and caused major problems for destinations in the Middle East and the Eastern Mediterranean, including Cyprus. Likewise, the Kosova conflict in 1999, a small event by global standards, caused reduced tourism in countries in the region including Greece. However, in both cases, tourist numbers grew again once the conflicts were over.\n\nThe difficulty here appears to be that the US 'war on terrorism' seems more like a more global 'war' and there seems little prospect of it being a short-term phenomenon.\n\nThe future impact of terrorism on tourism will, of course, depend on the future nature and scale of terrorism. It certainly looks today as if terrorism is now part of our everyday life and that the targeting of tourists looks set to continue.\n\nWe have made the following assumptions in relation to the future:\n\n\u2022 terrorists will increasingly attack tourists;\n\n\u2022 terrorist groups will target new destinations and facilities such as ferries and cruise ships; \u2022 locations where foreign tourists congregate will become specific targets for terrorist groups;\n\n\u2022 tourists from particular countries such as Israel, the UK and the USA will continue to be the main targets for terrorists; \u2022 tourists' behaviour may become an increasing motive for attacks being made on them.\n\nThe industry needs to reassure tourists that travel is safe and will have to put more resources into security to achieve this. Hotels are likely to become more security conscious as they currently do little or nothing to protect their guests, specifically, from terrorists. Indeed security may become a way in which hotels seek to achieve competitive advantage.\n\nTour operators may feel obliged to make tourists even more aware of terrorist risks in particular destinations than they do currently, in case they are sued if their clients are harmed by terrorist action. Some sectors of tourism believe the concern over terrorist threats are a potential opportunity for them, including:\n\n\u2022 small-scale tour operators who keep their clients well away from tourist 'honeypots' which appear to be the targets for the terrorists; \u2022 places which are perceived to be 'safe' such as Scandinavia; \u2022 rural 'off-the-beaten-track' destinations; \u2022 video-conferencing companies who anticipate the terrorist threat may lead to a reduction in business trips.\n\nThe media will play a massive role in the future relationship between terrorism and tourism. The way they report terrorist attacks and threats will influence the perceptions and purchase behaviour of tourists. In a perverse way, the growth of terrorist attacks on tourists will probably lead to a growth in the so-called 'Dangerous Place' travel where some people deliberately travel to risky places for the adrenaline rush.\n\nSome host communities which are upset by the behaviour and impact of tourists may learn the lessons from terrorist attacks on tourists and try to use terrorism to change the way the tourism industry operates in their areas. This could involve kidnapping, and attacks on the property of major corporations, for instance. Whatever happens, it seems certain that terrorism and tourism have now become inextricably linked for the foreseeable future.\n\nIn recent years tourists have gone from being accidental victims of terrorism to prime targets for terrorist groups. Since 11 September 2001 terrorism has become a constant consideration for the tourism industry and because there is no end in sight to the current spate of global terrorism, this is likely to continue in the future. On 11 September, in New York, and in Bali and Kenya in 2002, the tourism world changed, probably forever."}
