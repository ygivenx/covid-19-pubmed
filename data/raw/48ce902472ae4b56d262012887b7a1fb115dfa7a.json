{"title": "Critical Care Viral Infections", "body": "The most common acute viral infections of the CNS are aseptic meningitis and encephalitis. Meningitis is inflammation of the meningeal layers surrounding the brain, involving headache, fevers, and meningismus. Encephalitis involves the brain parenchyma and alterations of the cerebral function. Other symptoms of encephalitis include fevers, headache, seizures, and focal neurologic deficits. Inflammation rarely confines itself to the meninges or parenchyma. As such, there is significant clinical overlap between these entities, termed \"meningoencephalitis.\" Nonetheless, the predominating features are useful for clinical distinction and treatment decisions. 3 Distinguishing viral from other causes of meningoencephalitis is challenging. History, exposures, imaging, and laboratory work are helpful in determining a cause. 3 History and exposures for common entities are detailed later. Temporal lobe encephalitis on imaging is suggestive of a viral cause, particularly herpes simplex virus (HSV). Another useful clue is the finding of hydrocephalus, rarely seen with viral CNS infections. 4 Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is the most important test for identifying a cause for CNS infections. The characteristic CSF profile for viral infection in lymphocytepredominant leukocytosis (neutrophils may predominate very early in infection, but this will shift rapidly) is elevated protein less than 150 mg/dL, normal glucose concentration, \n\nHerpes simplex virus (HSV) is unique from other CNS viral infections in many ways. First, it is treated more easily with a readily available antiviral, acyclovir, making identification critical. Second, it is extremely common and demonstrates no seasonal predominance pattern and thus must be considered in all patients presenting with meningoencephalitis. Third, the clinical distinction between meningitis and encephalitis in this syndrome is clinically significant, because encephalitis can be fatal without treatment where meningitis is self-limited. 5\n\nRecognition and treatment of HSV encephalitis is critical. Without treatment, mortality approaches 70%, and even with treatment, mortality rates can be as high as 30%. \n\ndrome), and amnesia, likely stemming from its predilection to affect the limbic system. 9,10 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrating unilateral temporal lobe abnormalities supports the diagnosis, with or without mass effect. These findings are seen less commonly on CT. 11 Treatment should be prompt to reduce sequelae of infection; Table 96 .2 summarizes the dosing regimens. Initiation of therapy should not be delayed while awaiting confirmatory testing. 8 Acyclovir infusion should be slow and with additional intravenous fluid boluses to prevent crystal formation and reduce risk of renal failure. Treatment should be 14 to 21 days in duration because of observed relapse in shorter courses of therapy. 12 As of now this treatment is recommended to be parenteral throughout the duration of therapy.\n\nMoreover, survivors frequently are left with neurologic and psychiatric sequelae. 6, 7 Gender, exposures, geography, and timing are not useful in predicting which patients have HSV encephalitis. There is a well-described bimodal distribution with regard to age, with peaks occurring in children younger than age 20 and adults older than age 50, 5 but any patient, regardless of age, should have CNS samples sent for HSV PCR if encephalitis is suspected. 8 Physical exam features are typical for encephalitis, including fever, altered mental status, focal deficits, and seizures. Oral lesions may or may not be seen. HSV-1 has a particular association with several behavioral syndromes, including hypomania, disinhibition (specifically the Kl\u00fcver-Bucy syn- \n\nand the viruses that cause encephalitis. Treatment of these is largely supportive. HIV screening in these patients is prudent, because this can seem to be asymptomatic meningitis, and because immunocompromised hosts are susceptible to a range of other viral and other causes of meningitis. Some vaccine-preventable illnesses that cause meningitis are poised to reemerge secondary to lower immunization rates. Mumps may occur with meningitis, but it is typically a self-limited process. 16 Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is an increasingly more frequently seen pathogen because of molecular testing. Clinical disease is seen almost exclusively in the immunocompromised host.\n\nA number of other viruses can cause encephalitis, including enterovirus, influenza, arenaviruses, and arboviruses. 17 For all of these, treatment is supportive. Diagnosis depends on molecular testing of CSF, clinical signs and symptoms, and history. Historical factors of concern include travel history, geography, any animal exposures, or sick contacts. Any patient with suspected viral meningitis should be treated with acyclovir until HSV as a cause has been ruled out. As for meningitis, HIV screening in this population is prudent because a number of other causes (e.g., JC virus) can occur in the HIV-positive population. 8 Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is infrequently a sequela of encephalitis. Enterovirus and West Nile virus, in particular, have a predilection for this aftereffect. In patients with rapidly ascending flaccid paralysis and a history compatible with recent encephalitic infection, this should be considered as a potential diagnosis.\n\nOne special cause of encephalitis worth mentioning is rabies. Rabies has the distinction of being the single deadliest viral illness known, with only one documented survivor. Treatment is limited to early postexposure prophylaxis with vaccination and wound cleaning. However, for a patient with rabies and active encephalitis, there are no treatments\n\nAlthough HSV-1 drives encephalitis, HSV-2 is associated more commonly with meningitis. The typical description of HSV meningitis is a recurrent infectious aseptic meningitis. Episodes of transient neurologic abnormalities associated with fever, headache, and meningitis may occur for 2 to 5 days at a time and spontaneously resolve. 5 Incidence is lower than for HSV encephalitis, and demographic and seasonal features are difficult to determine. History, however, may elicit known genital herpes or lesions in a significant proportion of patients. Currently, a standardized guidelinebased treatment approach to HSV meningitis does not exist. 13 Initial treatment may be with acyclovir IV as described for encephalitis (see Table 96 .2). However, after stability, these patients can be transitioned to oral therapy on discharge for 10 to 14 days of total acyclovir. 14\n\nImmunocompetent persons have been reported to develop varicella zoster virus (VZV) meningitis; this is typically self-limited and of little consequence. 15 VZV encephalitis typically is associated with disseminated disease in a host with an active zoster outbreak. This can occur in immunocompetent hosts, although most cases occur in the immune compromised. Diagnosis can be accomplished via CSF PCR. Clinical trials have not established the efficacy or need for treatment of VZV encephalitis in immunocompetent hosts, but in patients with normal renal function, acyclovir 10 to 12 mg/kg IV q8h is the treatment of choice; renal function adjustments are presented in Table 96 .3. Duration of therapy is 10 to 14 days. 8\n\nAside from HSV, other significant causes of aseptic meningitis include the Enterovirus family (most common), HIV, structure and high transmissibility allows for new strains to sweep the globe every several decades after an \"antigenic shift\" and resulting in a pandemic. Pandemics occurred in 1918, 1957, 1968 , and most recently in 2009. Each was associated with unpredictable seasonality, and higher resource utilization and mortality. Pandemic strains become predominant seasonal circulating strains in intervening years, where cases follow a typical pattern of starting in late fall, peaking in mid to late winter, and disappearing by the end of spring. Particularly during \"normal\" seasonal influenza years, there is significant local variation in the onset and termination of the flu season. 27, 28 Testing for influenza typically is restricted to the flu season, except for in the case of known contacts and during unusual outbreaks of activity. The effectiveness of antivirals even in that window has been called into question in several systematic reviews. 29, 30 Nonetheless, current IDSA treatment guidelines support their use for patients in the first 48 hours after symptom onset, and reports of reduced mortality during the H1N1 outbreak in 2009 and a favorable side effect profile have encouraged physicians to treat outside of this window. 28, [31] [32] [33] Currently, the preferred agents are neuraminidase inhibitors including oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir. Dosing is summarized in Table 96 . 4 . The 2009 H1N1 pandemic tested several novel methods of treatment for influenza-associated ARDS. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was one of the more effective strategies, 34 and critically ill influenza patients appear to have a more clear benefit from ECMO than other adult populations. More research is needed in this area.\n\nAs mentioned above, viral shedding can occur in noninfected or postinfected states, so a positive test result does not mean a viral cause of disease has been determined definitively. For example, it is not uncommon to identify CMV on BAL specimens in hosts who are asymptomatically shedding. The context of the host and pathogen should be considered. Clinically significant CMV reactivation is unusual in immune competent hosts, and detection in this setting does not equate to disease. Diagnosis of CMV pneumonia requires pneumonitis, usually identified via biopsy. 35 Another consideration in viral respiratory infections is concomitant bacterial superinfection. Viral pneumonia renders a host more susceptible to other infections, and severe bacterial pneumonias can develop concomitantly. This is well described with influenza, in which much of the 1918 H1N1 appeared to occur 7 to 14 days postinfection because of pneumonias, particularly Streptococcus pneumonia. 36 that have proven reliably effective. Any samples being handled sent for laboratory testing with rabies virus should be marked as such because of the risk to lab workers. 18\n\nMany pneumonias (community and hospital acquired), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can be caused by a plethora of viruses, including influenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza, Hantavirus, human metapneumovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus. Some of these have classic associations, such as Hantavirus and Sin Nombre virus, with an ARDS-like syndrome after exposure to rodents, 19 or Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome after exposure to camels. 20 Most, however, are seasonal and circulating in the community.\n\nDespite the diversity in viral infections causing respiratory illness, most share a common treatment: supportive care. Although there are continuing attempts to make effective antivirals, 21 currently influenza is the only common respiratory infection in which antiviral therapy is part of standard medical practice for immunocompetent adults. In select patients, RSV treatment with ribavirin is being attempted, but this is not yet standard of care.\n\nThe lack of guided treatment does not, however, preclude the need to effectively diagnose the responsible cause. Continuing antibacterial therapy in patients with viral respiratory infection has no beneficial effect on outcomes and increases the risk of multi-drug-resistant organism colonization. 22 Identification of a viral infection can be used as a basis for early de-escalation of antibiotics. Although studies on rapid influenza and bacterial respiratory pathogen testing have shown mixed results on antimicrobial prescribing in practice, 23, 24 the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) endorses their use as part of antimicrobial stewardship practice. 25 Despite this, providers should remember that these swabs are not 100% accurate. Nasopharyngeal swabs do not always correlate with findings on bronchoalveolar lavage. 26 This may be due to postinfection shedding from resolved disease, inadequate movement of virus between upper and lower respiratory tracts, or other factors, but like all test results, these have to be interpreted in context.\n\nInfluenza is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and worldwide. Influenza's genetic in conjunction with pulse steroids, plasma exchange, hemodiafiltration, and use of experimental protease inhibitors to avoid disseminated intravascular coagulation (Table  96 .5). Lamivudine was associated with a 0.25 (0.07-0.91) hazard ratio for mortality. Another retrospective study did not replicate this, finding no mortality benefit from viral suppression. 42 However, the authors recommended considering nucleoside inhibitor therapy anyway, because it may reduce the risk of recurrence posttransplant. The American Association for the Study of Liver Disease suggests considering lamivudine (and possibly other agents) for acute hepatitis B but notes evidence is equivocal and rates this a level III recommendation. 43 Given the paucity of evidence, such agents should be considered only in conjunction with expert consultation. HSV-and VZV-induced fulminant failure should be treated with acyclovir 5 to 10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for at least 7 days (see Table 96 .2 for renal dose adjustment). 43 The outcomes after transplantation for these viruses are not as clear, but these patients still should be considered for transplantation.\n\nOther agents such as EBV, hepatitis A, E, and yellow fever have no specific treatments. Because of the high mortality of fulminant hepatitis, regardless of the cause, expert consultation should be sought to evaluate for liver transplantation. 44\n\nChronic viral hepatitis is seen most commonly with hepatitis C, although a minority of hepatitis B patients, as well as those with hepatitis B and E, can develop chronic disease. Chronic disease is defined as an infection persisting longer than 6 months. The indolent nature of these infections typically does not cause critical illness. Infection with chronic hepatitis certainly can increase susceptibility and sequelae to other hepatic injuries, including toxic, ischemic, and coinfection with acute viral hepatitis 45 but does not require directed treatment.\n\nChronic hepatitis B can be treated with interferon and/ or antivirals. Identifying candidates for treatment and determining the best course of therapy is complicated, and many patients end up on indefinite therapy. Treatment interruption increases the risk of resistance and treatment failure and ideally should not be interrupted in the ICU. If this is necessary, seek expert hepatology and/or infectious disease input. 46 Novel direct acting agents have revolutionized the treatment of hepatitis C. These agents are generally well tolerated and require relatively short courses of therapy to achieve sustained virologic response. Patients who are on such agents ideally should have them continued in the ICU.\n\nMost infectious gastrointestinal illnesses are caused by viruses. Noroviruses, for example, are the most common cause of gastroenteritis. 37 Although more common in immunocompromised hosts, CMV can cause a treatable colitis without viremia in immunocompetent hosts. 38 However, in immunologically normal hosts, the most commonly encountered illnesses with specific treatments are hepatitis infections.\n\nAcute viral hepatitis can be a manifestation of any of the viral hepatitides (A, B, C, D, and E) in a normal host. In appropriate hosts and settings, other causes may include adenovirus, Epstein-Bar virus, CMV, HSV, VZV, or yellow fever, but the focus of this discussion is on the hepatitis viruses. 39 Although genetically and structurally dissimilar, the five hepatitis viruses cause a common acute presentation. Viruses can be differentiated by molecular testing and serology, and history may provide a clue as to the responsible pathogen. Hepatitis A and E are transmitted via a fecal-oral route, whereas B, C, and D are transmitted via contact with infected fluids. Geography also provides some hints, because hepatitis B is the leading cause of fulminant disease in the developed world, whereas hepatitis E dominates in India. 39, 40 Most acute infections are subclinical or self-limited, but a minority may go on to fulminant disease and critical illness. Initial symptoms include elevated transaminases, malaise, myalgias, arthralgias, and headache. Fever is more common in hepatitis A and E than B and C. Hepatitis B can be associated with serum sickness-like syndrome.\n\nFulminant hepatitis is severe liver failure developing within 8 weeks of becoming symptomatic. Although chronic hepatitis C infection increases the risk of fulminant disease when the patient is infected acutely with another hepatitis virus, it rarely causes fulminant acute hepatitis on its own. Hepatitis E has a predilection for causing fulminant hepatitis in pregnant women. Although less common, it is prudent to test for HSV and VZV as causes for acute liver failure, because treatment options exist for these agents. 39 The liver failure seen in fulminant hepatitis includes encephalopathy, coagulopathy, cerebral edema, cardiovascular collapse, and hepatorenal syndrome. Mortality can be greater than 80%. Treatment is largely supportive. A small trial of antiviral therapy for fulminant HBV hepatitis 41 was associated with lower mortality in a selected group of younger patients without preexisting liver disease or HIV. Patients in this study received 100 to 150 mg/day lamivudine "}
