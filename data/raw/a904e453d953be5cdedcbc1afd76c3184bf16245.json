{"title": "", "body": "Genosensor on gold thin-films with enzymatic electrochemical detection of a SARS virus sequence Patricia Abad-Valle, Mar\u00eda Teresa Fern\u00e1ndez-Abedul and Agust\u00edn Costa-Garc\u00eda 36.1 OBJECTIVES (a) To construct a hybridisation-based genosensor for a SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus sequence on a 100 nm sputtered gold film which works as immobilisation and transduction surface. (b) To test the sensitivity and the selectivity of the SARS genosensor using complementary strands of SARS virus and three-base mismatch strands.\n\nA target sequence corresponds to a portion of SARS virus, bases exactly comprise between 29218 and 29247, both included. A three-base mismatch strand with mismatches located in bases number 5, 15 and 26. Both strands are biotinylated at the 3 0 end for allowing hybridisation detection. Ethanol, magnesium chloride, sodium citrate, Trizma base, sodium chloride, EDTA, formamide, hydrochloric and sulphuric (95-97%) acids are of analytical grade. Water is purified employing a Milli-Q plus 185 equip from Millipore.\n\nA 0.125-mm-thick polyimide substrate named Kapton HN s (Goodfellow), an epoxy resin (CW2400) obtained from RS Components and self-adhesive washers of 5 mm internal diameter (19.6 mm 2 of internal area) are used to construct the working electrodes.\n\nMeasurements are performed with an Autolab PGSTAT 10 (Eco-Chemie) potentiostat interfaced to an ADL Pentium 120 computer system and controlled by Autolab GPES software version 4.8 for Windows 98.\n\nA Crison Micro-pH 2001 pH-meter and a Sanyo (MIR-162) incubator are also used.\n\nAn Emitech sputter coater model K550 is used to deposit the gold thin film working electrode.\n\nThe three-electrode potentiostatic system is schematised in Fig. 36.1 . Working electrodes are made on 5 \u00c2 5 cm 2 supports of 0.125-mm-thick polyimide substrate named Kapton HN s (Goodfellow). The kapton slide is cleaned with ethanol and after drying, it is covered with gold by a sputtering process using an Emitech sputter coater model K550. Gold atoms are deposited (from the cathode) over kapton (placed on the anode) in a vacuum chamber filled with argon. Gold layer thickness is controlled by the time and the intensity of the discharge. For a 100-nm-thick layer a 35 mA discharge is applied over 220 s. After that, a conductor wire is attached to the centre of one of the sides by means of an epoxy resin (CW2400) obtained from RS Components, that is cured at room temperature.\n\nThe working area is limited by self-adhesive washers of 5 mm internal diameter (19.6 mm 2 of internal area). The total area of the gold surface lets to stick 23 washers approximately. The gold film is placed on a support where a crocodile connection is fixed.\n\nReference and auxiliary electrodes are coupled in a micropipette tip. The reference electrode consists of an anodised silver wire introduced in a tip through a syringe rubber piston. The tip is filled with saturated KCl solution and contains a low-resistance liquid junction. The platinum wire that acts as auxiliary electrode is fixed with insulating tape. For measurement recording, the tip is fixed on an electrochemical cell Metrohm support allowing horizontal and vertical movement. \n\nThe response curves for different concentrations of complementary target are shown in Fig. 36. 3. There is a notorious difference between the analytical signal obtained for a 3.03 nM solution of the complementary target strand and three-base mismatch strand. In stringent experimental conditions (2 \u00c2 SSC containing 50% formamide), the analytical signals are 47.61 and 3.96 mA, respectively, when hybridisation takes place for 1 h. Therefore, a 100% discrimination is achieved.\n\nRepeatability is checked under these experimental conditions, 1 h of hybridisation and a 2 \u00c2 SSC buffer containing 50% of formamide. The value of the RSD was 11% for nine measurements. Genosensor on gold thin-films e255 magnitude when compared with limits of detection reported in the bibliography for DNA assays that detect a-naphthol on thick-film gold electrodes 0.25 nM for Carpini et al. [2] and 0.22 nM for Xu et al. [3] . 146 nM is the limit of detection obtained for an AP-based DNA assay that employs p-aminophenylphosphate as substrate [4] . Specific quantification of 1 nM is achieved with other enzymatic schemes [5] . A limit of detection of 0.20 nM [6] and 30 nM [7] are achieved for indirect detection using an electrochemical indicator and for direct electrochemical detection respectively."}
