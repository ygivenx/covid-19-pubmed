{"title": "Supplementary Materials A creature with a hundred of waggly tails: Intrinsically disordered proteins in the ribosome", "body": "The illustrative examples of yeast ribosomal proteins with long disordered regions are listed in order of the increasing length of their IDPRs (for proteins with two IDPRs, the longer region is taken into consideration): L16 (residues 103-110), L30e (residues 1-8), L34e (residues 114-121), L11 (residues 1-8 and 156-165), S10e (residues 97-105), S11 (residues 1-10), S17e (residues 90-94 and 127-136), S8e (residues 124-134), S4 (residues 187-197), S19 (residues 1-6 and 132-142), S10 (residues 1-14), S3 (residues 226-240), S6e (residues 219-236), L6e (residues 110-128), S7 (residues 1-19), S12e (residues 1-19), L23 (residues 1-21), S26e (residues 99-119), L22\n\n(residues 157-184), S5 (residues 1-33), S25e (residues 1-36), L24e (residues 99-135), S2\n\n(residues 208-257), P2 (residues 52-110), P1 (residues 47-106), L40e (residues 1-76), S31e\n\n(residues 1-81), P0 (residues 108-181 and 222-312), S1e (residues 1-199 and 234-255), and Stm1 (residues 1-24 and 180-273) [1] . Some on-ribosome functions of the ribosomal proteins S1 is involved in delivery of the mRNA into the proximity of the ribosome during initiation and also is responsible for the translational feedback regulation of S1 operon. S3, S4, and S5 form the mRNA entry pore and may have a helicase activity during translation to unwind mRNA secondary structure. S4, S5 and S12 are involved in the decoding and fidelity of translation, with S5 facilitating changes of rRNA conformations that alters the selection mode of the ribosome from accurate to error prone and vice versa, and with S12 participating in decoding of the second and third codon positions at the A site of the ribosome. L1 and L16/L27 are involved in the release and binding of tRNAs to the ribosome, respectively. L1 is also responsible for the translational feedback regulation of the L11 operon, whereas proteins L7/L12 (which are involved in the elongation-factor binding and GTPase activation) together with L10 are involved in translational feedback regulation of the L10 operon. L4 and L22 that protrude into the ribosomal tunnel confer resistance to macrolide antibiotics. In addition, L22 may also interact with nascent chains to control translation of particular proteins, whereas L4 may play a role in rRNA transcription antitermination. L9 influences tRNA stability at the P site, regulates the mRNA movement, and controls the efficiency of the translational bypassing. L11 and L10 \u00d7 (L7/L12) 4 proteins, that are located at the stalk region, are involved in binding of the elongation factors EF-G and EF-Tu to the ribosome. L16 is involved in controlling the correct position of the acceptor stem of A-and P-site tRNAs and also in correct positioning of the ribosome recycling factor (RRF) on the ribosome. L17, L22, L23, L24, L29, and L32 are known to form a ring around the tunnel exit site of the ribosome, with two members of this ring, with L22 being able to interact with specific nascent chains to regulate translation, and with L23 and L29 being involved binding of the signal recognition particle and trigger factor. Finally, bacterial-specific ribosomal protein L27 controls the placement of the acceptor stem of P-site tRNA and is responsible for binding of the ribosome recycling factor on the 50S subunit [2] . Table S1 . Summary of the RPG_3411 dataset. Species in each domain are sorted by their abbreviated name. The last two columns list the number of RNA-and DNA-binding proteins that were selected at random from UniProt to match the number of ribosomal proteins. Table S2 . List of functional annotations together with the corresponding number of disordered segments based on the 911 annotated disordered segments selected from the RPG_3411 dataset. Total of 26 functions, where the \"protein-RNA binding\" and \"modification sites\" combine several sub-function, were considered. The functions are sorted in the descending order by the total number of segments that is broken into the number of short (4 to 30 amino acids) and long (30 or more amino acids) segments. The functions shown in italics have less than 20 annotations for both short and long segments and were not included in Figure 9 . "}
