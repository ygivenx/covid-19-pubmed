{"title": "General Principles in the Diagnosis of Infection", "body": "Tissue sampling is fundamentally important in the diagnosis of infection. All excised tissues should be considered as potentially infective. This approach fosters due diligence with respect to the possibility of contagion, as well as thoughtful concern as to how the tissues will be handled to optimize the chances of establishing an accurate diagnosis ( Table 2-2) . Samples of excised tissues should be harvested by sterile technique and sent to the microbiology laboratory with information concerning the types of organism that are being considered diagnostically. Directions to consider anaerobic and fastidious species should be clearly stated.\n\nThe surgical pathologist must ascertain that all diagnostic possibilities have been considered. Consultation with an infectious disease specialist can be invaluable in ensuring that specimens are properly handled ab initio. What must be avoided is thoughtlessly placing a biopsy specimen directly into formalin fixative without first considering a diagnosis of infection.\n\nTouch imprints should be routinely prepared and can be stained in the frozen-section suite or in the microbiology laboratory. In general, 5 to 10 touch imprints will suffice, with sampling from the most suspicious portions of the biopsy specimen (e.g., areas of necrosis or suppuration).\n\nHarvesting a portion of the biopsy specimen for ultrastructural analysis can foster the accurate diagnosis of many organisms (e.g., viruses, Tropheryma whippelii, microsporidia). 2 Specimens may be harvested for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing to establish the diagnosis of others (e.g., Coxiella, mycobacteria, rickettsia). 3 The rapid diagnosis of a frozen section can help to focus the diagnostic workup. All of the pertinent histochemical and ancillary studies can ideally be ordered before the permanent sections are processed, to avoid undue delay in diagnosis.\n\nThe identification of infection in biopsied tissues is the primary responsibility of the surgical pathologist. In an age when both noninvasive and minimally invasive approaches and techniques have increased, it is important to revisit the role of the biopsy in the diagnosis of infection (Table 2-1) . Isolating microorganisms in the microbiology laboratory is a sensitive and accurate approach to their identification, but it has several important limitations. First, it cannot distinguish infection from colonization, nor can it ascertain the significance of the isolated organism. Only the presence of an organism in situ, together with an expected inflammatory response by the host, constitutes acceptable evidence of its role in infection.\n\nFor example, consider how to interpret the clinical significance of a fungus isolated from the airways of a patient with bronchiectasis who also has a new pulmonary infiltrate in the setting of immunosuppression. Is the fungal isolate the likely cause of the opportunistic infection, or might it be a benign the sensitivity and specificity of histochemically stained sections is limited. An example is tuberculosis, in which biopsies can fail to demonstrate mycobacteria in almost half of cases. 7 But even in this setting, the appearance of the inflammatory response in situ should foster a working diagnosis that is often sufficiently reliable to institute empirical treatment.\n\nThere is currently no uniformly accepted classification schema for the histologic patterns of response yielded by microorganisms. The inflammatory response in infection is a function of the host response, which is in turn a function of (1) the anatomy of the affected organ, (2) the virulence factors produced by the infective agent, and (3) host immunocompetence. The surgical pathologist must be aware that a single species of microorganism may be capable of evoking a variety of different patterns of inflammation. An example is the broad spectrum of disorders produced in response to infection with Aspergillus spp., which ranges from benign colonization, to hypersensitivity responses, to malignant angioinvasive infection. 8 The characteristic types of inflammation elicited by infection ( Table 2-3) can be broadly categorized as follows.\n\n1. Pyogenic responses. In these responses, neutrophils predominate, leading to pus formation. They are evoked primarily by bacteria, although viruses and fungi can also elicit them ( Fig. 2-1 ).\n\nTissue necrosis can occur in several forms. In certain infections, such as those caused by amebas or gram-negative bacteria, liquefactive necrosis is frequently seen (Fig. 2-2 ). Other forms, such as ischemic, mummefactive, and caseous necrosis, are often seen in mycobacterial and fungal infections.\n\nThis response is characterized by the presence of epithelioid macrophages with multikaryon (giant cell) formation. It appears to reflect cellmediated immunity to poorly catabolized antigens and is evoked by mycobacteria, fungi, and parasites ( Fig. 2-3 ).\n\nThese responses are characterized primarily by the presence of foamy macrophages and are a prominent component of infections caused by Legionella, few surgical pathologists would balk at the idea of ordering additional sections to exclude malignancy in a biopsy they deemed suspicious, it is not uncommon for a pathologist to examine only a single histochemically stained tissue section in the diagnostic process of infection. 4 More egregious is the fantasy that the causative infectious agent will eventually be diagnosed by the microbiology laboratory, so there is no need for the surgical pathologist to belabor the process. This approach is wrong-minded for several reasons. First, the microbiology laboratory may fail to identify a causative organism. 5 Second, the organism isolated by the laboratory may not represent the actual infective agent in vivo. The analogy is the role for Gram staining of secretions in chronically intubated patients to determine whether there is a neutrophilic exudate consistent with infection and whether there is a predominating organism-steps that can promote the choice of appropriate antibiotic therapy. 6 In this setting, undue emphasis on culture results can lead to a seemingly endless process of adding or eliminating antibiotics in patients who are merely colonized by bacteria and not actually infected. Treatment decisions that do not take into account the host response and dominating organisms will tend to favor the production of increasingly antibioticresistant isolates and may potentially compromise public health. This is only one of several compelling reasons to consider diagnostic biopsies in patients with infections in situations that do not readily yield to noninvasive approaches.\n\nDespite the merits of examining biopsy specimens in the diagnosis of infection, one must be aware of those situations in which Rhodococcus, Calymmatobacterium, Leishmania, and T. whippelii ( Fig. 2-4 ). In patients who are severely immunocompromised, organisms that normally elicit granulomatous inflammation may instead evoke histiocytic infiltrates.\n\nThis is seen in response to multicellular parasites and certain fungi ( Fig. 2-5 ).\n\n6. Cytopathic changes. Although this is not properly a type of inflammation, cytopathic changes do reflect a response to viral infection. Nuclear inclusions are part of the response to DNA viruses, whereas cytologic inclusions are seen with some RNA and DNA viral infections, such as cytomegalovirus ( Fig. 2-6 ).\n\nIn the setting of profound immunosuppression, one may not see inflammation; only the uninhibited growth of microorganisms is apparent ( Fig. 2-7 ).\n\nThis classification schema is only a crude approximation, because overlap patterns of inflammation are common, as with necrotizing granulomatous inflammation, granulohistiocytic inflammation ( Fig. 2-8) , and granulomatous inflammation with tissue eosinophilia (Fig. 2-9 ). The primary didactic element is that careful consideration of the histological response in situ can help to narrow what would otherwise be a very broad differential diagnosis and can also provide invaluable information concerning host immunocompetence. For this reason, surgical pathologists must develop expertise concerning the inflammatory patterns that can accompany reduced immunocompetence resulting from genetic factors, age, toxins, and drugs, because they can skew the expected pattern of inflammation and at times confound the diagnosis.\n\nThe identification of microorganisms in biopsy samples is enhanced by the selective application of widely available histochemical stains ( Table 2-4) . Pathologists should be aware of the spectrum of histochemical staining by microorganisms and knowledgeable with respect to how to formulate combinations of stains to enhance diagnostic specificity. 9\n\nThe majority of pathogens can be identified with the standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain. These include cytopathic viruses, some bacteria, most fungi, and virtually all parasites (Table 2-5).\n\nThe tissue Gram stain is a congener of the Gram stain used routinely to identify organisms in body secretions and fluids. The Brown-Hopps stain is currently the preparation of choice, because it enhances gram-negative bacteria and rickettsia to a greater degree than the Brown-Brenn. In addition, the latter can be hazardous to technical personnel and has largely fallen into disfavor. The tissue Gram stain colors the cell walls of grampositive bacteria a deep violaceous blue (Fig. 2-10A ) and gram- negative bacteria a pale salmon pink (see Fig. 2-10B) . Consequently, it is far easier to detect gram-positive species, and one must be careful not to overlook the presence of faintly stained gram-negative species. Gram variability is a potential pitfall in interpretation, because it can raise the specter of polymicrobial infection. Attention to the uniform morphologic characteristics of stained organisms is the best way to avoid being misled by this phenomenon.\n\nNonbacterial pathogens can also be identified with the Gram stain. The blastoconidia (yeast) of Candida spp. \n\nThe impregnation of tissue sections with silver constitutes the basis of the Warthin-Starry, Dieterle, and Steiner stains. There is some controversy among experts as to whether these stains are equally efficacious in the identification of certain organisms, such as Bartonella spp., but in general they yield comparable results. In theory, all eubacteria, including mycobacteria, will stain positively with silver impregnation. However, in our experience, they do not do so reliably, and this approach cannot be recommended as a screening tool. In general, bacteria are enhanced both colorimetrically and in size by the deposition of silver salts on their cell walls, making them easier to identify but at times causing confusion in interpretation. Background staining presents a problem in interpretation, but the morphologic regularity of eubacteria usually allows for accurate identification, once experience has been established with the technique.\n\nCertain weakly gram-reactive or non-gram-reactive bacteria cannot be demonstrated reliably by any other histochemical method. These include Treponema spp. (Fig. 2-13) , Borrelia spp., Bartonella spp., Leptospira spp., and Calymmatobacterium. Weakly staining gram-negative bacteria, including Legionella spp., Burkholderia spp., Francisella spp., and Helicobacter, are also best demonstrated by silver impregnation.\n\nThe Gomori methenamine silver (GMS) and Gridley stains are the preferred methods for demonstrating fungi (Table 2-6) . Because certain fungi demonstrated by GMS do not consistently stain well with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), the latter should be reserved as a secondary approach, but it can at times enhance morphologic detail. Although the GMS is often counterstained with methyl green for contrast, other counterstains can be applied. It is possible, for example, to counterstain with H&E; this allows for a detailed assessment of the cellular immune response and promotes accurate identification of intravascular and perineural invasion by organisms. All gram-positive bacteria, including the actinomycetes, stain with GMS ( Fig. 2-14) , as do some encapsulated gramnegative bacteria, such as Klebsiella spp. Bacteria that have been treated before tissue sampling (e.g., infective endocarditis), may not be well decorated by the Gram stain, but they often retain their GMS positivity. For this reason, both stains should be examined before excluding a gram-positive bacterial infection. The actinomycetes, including mycobacteria, are gram-positive eubacteria and consequently also stain with GMS. The GMS is the stain of choice for demonstrating Pneumocystis jiroveci (Fig. 2-15) , and it highlights the trophozoites of Entamoeba A B modified stain for acid-fast bacteria (Fite-Faraco or Putt's) detects mycobacterial antigens that are sensitive to strong acid, a step in the decolorization of the ZN stain. For this reason, it can be used to screen for all mycobacteria and may be required to detect certain atypical mycobacteria, such as Mycobacterium leprae, as well as Nocardia, Rhodococcus, and Legionella micdadei. The cortical spines of Schistosoma spp. (Fig. 2-18) , the hooklets of Echinococcus, and the spores of Cryptosporidium also stain well, but variably, with modified acid-fast bacillus stains.\n\nMasson's trichrome, Movat's pentachrome, and Wilder reticulin stains can be useful ancillary methods for classifying helminthic infections (Fig. 2-19 ). The inclusions of cytomegalovirus are demonstrated well by trichrome stains. The reticulin stain demonstrates the details of most helminths, the amasti-histolytica, encysted amebas, the intracytoplasmic inclusions of cytomegalovirus-infected cells, the polar bodies of microsporidia, and the cyst wall of Echinococcus spp. (Fig. 2-16 ).\n\nThe Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain and its modifications historically have been essential tools in the identification of mycobacteria. 3 Mycobacterium spp. (Fig. 2-17A ) are also GMS-positive (see Fig.  2-17B) , and some atypical mycobacteria, such as Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC), also stain with PAS. The is an essential feature in the diagnosis of Cryptococcus; however, this staining, although invariably present, may be difficult to detect in capsule-deficient variants (Fig. 2-20) . 11\n\nThe Fontana-Masson stain demonstrates pre-melanin precursors within the cell wall of Cryptococcus neoformans and is an essential confirmatory approach to the in situ identification of capsulardeficient forms (Fig. 2-21) . 12 All dematiaceous fungi are positive with Fontana-Masson, and this stain can help to confirm the impression of pigmentation seen in H&E sections.\n\nA number of stains (e.g., Feulgen) can detect viral inclusions with cells. However, none adds considerably to the H&E stain gotes of trypanosomes, and the rod-shaped kinetoplast of Leishmania spp.\n\nGiemsa stains and their variants can help in identifying a wide spectrum of pathogens, including protozoa, bacteria, chlamydia, and rickettsia. However, the small size of some of these organisms (e.g., rickettsiae) limits the degree of confidence in establishing an accurate diagnosis, and prior experience in diagnosing these infections is essential. 10\n\nSeveral fungi, most notably Cryptococcus, Blastomyces, and Rhinosporidium, exhibit mucicarminophilia, either in their secreted capsules (Cryptococcus) or in their cell walls. Mucicarminophilia \n\nMolecular techniques continue to dramatically reshape clinical microbiology practice. Currently, molecular techniques involving the identification of microbial nucleic acids are critical to the management of a growing number of infectious agents, most importantly the chronic viral infections, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus. HIV management is a prototype for the implementation of mole cular medicine, because the diagnosis can be made using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification of viral RNA, antiviral therapy regimens can be adjusted based on serial RT-PCR viral load measurements, and resistance mutations can be detected by sequencing of the viral genes targeted by current drugs (protease and reverse transcriptase inhibitors).\n\nIn the setting of surgical pathology, a role is beginning to be developed for molecular techniques in the pathologic assessment of infection. The most relevant techniques in the setting of tissue diagnosis are in situ microbial detection using nucleic acid probes (in situ hybridization) and PCR using nucleic acids purified from tissue sections. These two techniques can allow for diagnosis when special stains and immunohistochemical stains are insensitive (e.g., low antigen expression), and in some instances, they can allow for speciation when microbes are identified with those techniques. In addition, molecular identification can accelerate definitive diagnosis with organisms that grow slowly or not at all in culture (e.g., fastidious organisms such as mycobacteria).\n\nIn situ hybridization (ISH) is a technique that uses fluorescent or radiolabeled nucleic acid probes to recognize specific microbial sequences in tissue sections. The probes contain RNA or in this regard, and they are rarely adopted in practice, especially since confirmatory immunostains have become more widely available.\n\nA large number of immunostains are available that can be helpful in the identification of microorganisms (Table 2-7) . 13 Many of these are commercially available and currently enjoy wide popularity in diagnostic pathology laboratories. Others are available reliably only at highly specialized centers such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Development of new immunohistochemical techniques can be a worthwhile but labor-intensive task. Because there is wide cross-reactivity among fungal species and among bacteria, it is critical to establish the potential crossreactivity of any new antibody and its relative specificity. 14 Nevertheless, it may at times be possible to limit the use of a reagent to a narrow range of differential diagnostic possibilities Recently, a novel chemical variant of DNA called peptide nucleic acids (PNA), consisting of nucleoside bases joined by a peptide backbone rather than a sugar backbone, has been used to detect microbial genetic material. PNA probes offer the advantage of chemical stability and higher sensitivity and specificity. These properties offer the opportunity of developing probes that can differentiate species in situ. Such probes have proved successful in differentiating tuberculous from nontuberculous mycobacterial infections by targeting the 16S ribosomal RNA; others have detected Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Candida species. [16] [17] [18] [19] Polymerase Chain Reaction PCR amplification to detect infectious agents in surgical pathology specimens is now so common that a basic description of the technique is unnecessary. 20,21 PCR is without a doubt the most sensitive detection method available, and because if can be performed on archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples, important diagnoses can be rendered even if cultures were not obtained from tissue biopsies at the time of processing (e.g., lung wedge resections for tumor that later reveal necrotizing granulomas). Common applications of PCR to surgical samples are listed in Table 2-8. Central to PCR, however, is the requirement the exact RNA or DNA sequences to be amplified must be known. Abundant DNA sequences complementary to the target genetic elements and allow for specific localization of microbes in tissue or within cells. Depending on the sequence, some ISH probes can also bind specifically to nucleic acids from individual species, allowing for differentiation of organisms with variable virulence. Although there is great specificity with many ISH probes, immunohistochemistry is preferred, if possible, because of ease of incorporation into the modern automated pathology laboratory.\n\nMost critical to the surgical pathologist is the identification of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in cervical cancer screening, and this is most often accomplished with the use of PCR or similar techniques from liquid Pap smear specimens. ISH can also be very effective for definitive detection of high-risk HPV subtypes in cervical biopsy analysis for dysplasia and in defining HPV status of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas. 15 Immunohistochemistry for HPV antigens has not proved sensitive enough (although p16 positivity is a reasonable surrogate marker of HPV infection). The HPV genome is present as episomes in low-grade lesions, so ISH reveals diffuse and intense staining ( Fig. 2-22) . In high-grade lesions and invasive carcinomas, the HPV genome integrates into the host genome, and ISH reveals a punctate nuclear signal.\n\nISH is also useful in the detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in lymphocytes, including in lymphoproliferative disorders, because the EBV-encoded RNAs (EBER1 and EBER2) are expressed at very high levels. Commercial EBER ISH assays have been developed and are automatable.\n\nB C microbial sequence data are publicly available, so that any equipped laboratory can analyze the most known pathogens.\n\nThere are a number of well-conserved genes in microorganisms, such as the ribosomal 16S gene and the heat-shock protein/ chaperonin HSP60/65 (or GroEL), that are excellent targets for PCR. Analysis of the16S ribosomal RNA gene in bacteria by PCR and subsequent sequencing is especially informative, because there are well-conserved sequences that can be used as binding sites for universal PCR primers adjacent to variable sequences and then analyzed and compared to databases of known sequences (Fig. 2-23 ). This sensitivity of PCR is not without its problems. Many of the most important infectious agents seen in general practice are found in the environment and can contaminate surgical specimens. For example, Aspergillus and mycobacterial species are normal denizens of the clinical laboratory, and if samples are not kept sterile, they may come in contact with these species during tissue processing. Even more vexing, such species also can A B C D continued\n\nDNA was isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue and amplified with primers to the HSP65 gene, showing positive bands for the MTb sample (E, lane 1) and the MAC sample (E, lane 2). An MTb-specific gene polymerase chain reaction assay (IS6110 gene) reveals a band only with MTb (E, lane 4). Water-only control lanes show no band in either reaction (E, lanes 3 and 6). The HSP65 gene products were subject to DNA sequencing with the bacterial sequence from the MTb sample in F and from the MAC in G. Alignment of the two sequences reveals numerous sequence differences (arrows) in the region, which can be used to differentiate the two species. E cause opportunistic infections, and so their identification cannot always be dismissed as clinically irrelevant."}
