{"title": "Emerging tick-borne infections in mainland China: an increasing public health threat", "body": "Ticks were the fi rst arthropods to be recognised as vectors that can transmit pathogens to human beings and are second only to mosquitoes as vectors of infectious diseases in the world. 1 Tick-borne infections are zoonoses with pathogens maintained in natural cycles involving tick vectors and animal hosts. Human beings are occasional hosts for ticks and are usually viewed as deadend hosts that have no role in maintaining tick-borne agents in nature. 2 Diff erent tick species favour distinct biotopes or environments, which defi ne their geographical distribution and, consequently, the areas of risk for human tick-borne infections. In the past three decades, tick-borne pathogens have emerged worldwide and become a great threat to human health. 1, 3 China is the largest developing country in the world and has made tremendous progress in the control and prevention of infectious diseases; however, emerging infectious diseases are the new challenge now facing China. 4 Although outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome and H5N1 and H7N9 avian infl uenza virus infections have attracted great attention, emerging tickborne diseases have generally been neglected by primary health-care providers and clinicians. Although an increasing number of tick-borne infections have been reported in mainland China, no comprehensive review of this substantial public health problem has been undertaken. We will provide an overview of the type and distribution of emerging tick-borne infections in tick vectors, animal hosts, and human beings. We will describe the clinical characteristics of human tick-borne diseases, and discuss possible factors contributing to their emergence.\n\nSince 1982, 33 emerging tick-associated agents have been identifi ed in mainland China, including eight species of spotted fever group rickettsiae (SFGR); 5-11 three species of Ehrlichia, 12-14 three species of Anaplasma, [15] [16] [17] and Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis 18 in the family Anaplasmataceae; six genospecies in the complex Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato; 19-23 11 species of Babesia; [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV). 34 The location and year in which each emerging tick-borne agent was fi rst identifi ed are shown in the appendix. Most (19 of 33) were initially detected in ticks; however, six were identifi ed in domestic animals (sheep, goat, buff alo, and dog), two in wild animals (Chinese white-bellied rat and Chinese hare), and six in people. Detailed information regarding the identifi cation of these emerging tick-borne infections is summarised in table 1.\n\nAmong the 33 newly recognised tick-associated agents, 15 have been reported to cause human infection, including: four species of SFGR; 11, 35, 46, 48 an Ehrlichia species, 53 two Anaplasma species, 17,53 and Candidatus N mikurensis; 18 three genospecies of B burgdorferi sensu lato; 19,21,78 three species of Babesia; 33, 104, 108 and SFTSV (table 2). 34 Six of the tick-borne pathogens were fi rst identifi ed in febrile patients (Candidatus Rickettsia tarasevichiae, Candidatus N mikurensis, Borrelia garinii, Borrelia afzelii, Babesia venatorum [not yet formally described], and SFTSV) and then shown to be associated with ticks ( SFTSV=severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus. *First identifi ed origin of each emerging tick-associated agent, including man, domestic animal, rodent, and tick. The agent that was simultaneously identifi ed from other hosts or ticks is shown in parentheses. \u2020Provinces include autonomous regions and metropolis. \u2021Not been formally described in taxonomic papers. ticks or animals, but their pathogenicity to human beings is unknown.\n\nEight novel species of SFGR have been recorded in mainland China since 1982 (table 1) . 5-11 These species are mainly distributed in northern China (north of 36\u00b0 north latitude).\n\nThe eight emerging species and uncharacterised species of SFGR have been shown to be associated with 16 tick species (fi gure 1). R heilongjiangiensis has been proven to infect a range of tick species, three rodent species, and goats (appendix). In northeastern China, R heilongjiangiensis was detected in nine tick species and two rodent species from Heilongjiang Province, [36] [37] [38] and in Haemaphysalis spp ticks from Jilin Province. 38 In Inner Mongolia, R heilongjiangiensis has been reported in Haemaphysalis verticalis, Detmacentor niveus, Hyalomma asiaticum kozlovi, Rhipicephalus pumilio, and Detmacentor nuttalli ticks. 39 In northwestern China, R heilongjiangiensis has been detected in Dermacentor silvarum ticks from Qinghai Province. 40 In southern China, R heilongjiangiensis has been detected in Haemaphysalis longicornis ticks from Guangdong Province, 41 in goats from Yunnan Province, 42 and in chestnut white-bellied rats from Hainan Province. 43 In central and eastern China, R heilongjiangiensis was identifi ed in Haemaphysalis fl ava ticks from Henan, Anhui, and Hubei provinces, 8 SFTS=severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. SFTSV=severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus.*Diagnostic methods: (A) a four-fold increase in titre of specifi c antibodies in blood sera collected from the acute and convalescent stages of illness, or a seroconversion of specifi c antibodies; (B) molecular detection and sequence determination; (C) isolation of pathogens from clinical samples; (D) light or electronic micrograph identifi cation for thin blood smear; and (E) methods were not provided. \u2020Not been formally described in taxonomic papers. (table 1) .\n\nOver a wide geographical distribution of 25 provinces in mainland China, 26 tick species have been shown to carry B burgdorferi sensu lato (fi gure 1). B garinii is the most common genospecies and has been identifi ed in many tick species (fi gure 1). 54 (table 1) .\n\nThe transmission of babesia is associated with 13 tick species (fi gure 1). 132, 133 Clinical manifestations for patients with Babesia species infections included fever, fatigue, anaemia, chills, and high levels of hepatic aminopherase and C-reactive protein. 33, 108, 104, 109, 107, 132, 133 Detailed infor mation about the clinical manifestations of each of these species of Babesia infections is summarised in the appendix.\n\nSFTSV is a novel member of the genus Phlebovirus in the Bunyaviridae family, and was fi rst identifi ed in China. The identifi cation of SFTSV infections was made possible by enhanced active surveillance in selected provinces of China. 34 Since a systematic review on the epidemiology, clinical signs, pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of human infection with SFTSV has been published, 157 we provide only a brief description and some new information about the infection.\n\nRhipicephalus microplus ticks, with a higher prevalence of infection in H longicornis (4-9%) compared with in R microplus (0-6%). 34, 110 Various animals, including goats, cattle, dogs, pigs, rodents, chickens, geese, and hedgehogs, might be infected by this pathogen. 110, 111 Studies in Shandong, Jiangsu, and Hubei provinces showed that goats and cattle had the highest seropositive rate. Furthermore, big animals usually had higher seropositive rates than small animals. 111,112\n\nAs of 2013, 2543 human SFTS infections have been reported to the China Center For Disease Control And Prevention, including 154 deaths. 34, [113] [114] [115] [116] [117] [118] Incidence hotspots are located in Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Shandong provinces of middle-eastern China, in addition to Liaoning Province of northeastern China (appendix). Clinical manifestations in patients with SFTS are non-specifi c with major symptoms including respiratory tract symptoms, sudden onset of fever up to 38-41\u00b0C, headache, fatigue, myalgia, and gastrointestinal symptoms (loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea). Multiple organ failure develops rapidly in most patients (with raised concentrations of serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase; and proteinuria and haematuria), and is usually accompanied by thrombocytopenia, leucocytopenia, and lymphadenopathy. 34, 117 \n\nBeyond doubt, advances in and application of molecular technologies have resulted in the discovery of novel agents and helped to identify human infections caused by agents previously detected in ticks. Thus, to some extent, the emergence of tick-borne infections has resulted from the discovery of novel pathogens through the use of more sensitive and reliable detection methods. However, various biological factors, such as tick and host population dynamics, which have caused an increase in the transmission and dissemination of tick-borne zoonotic diseases, are probably the main reasons for the emergence of these infections. 3 Changes in land use have aff ected the emergence of tick-borne zoonotic diseases by altering the interactions and abundance of ticks, wild and domestic hosts, and human exposure to pathogens. 158 An example is the emergence of Lyme disease in northeastern USA. Reforestation of this region during the 20th century is thought to have increased the population of white-tailed deer, which greatly amplifi ed the number of Ixodes scapularis. Consequentially, vector tick densities grew and expanded, contributing substantially to the emergence of Lyme disease in the USA. 159 Fragmentation of forests in eastern regions of Canada and the USA might have increased the relative abundance of small mammals because of a reduction in predator communities, leading to an increase in B burgdorferi sensu lato infection rates in I scapularis nymphs. Ultimately, people in these areas were confronted with a higher risk of Lyme disease. 160, 161 Since the mid-1990s, the Chinese central government has initiated the Greening Program to regain forests and grasslands from former agricultural lands. 162 Reforestation and grass replanting with high-quality vegetative cover could have increased the abundance and diversity of ticks and animal hosts, and favoured the re-establishment of pre-existing tick vector enzootic cycles in these areas. One example described in our study was in the most severely endemic region of SFTS. Our fi ndings showed that the incidence of SFTS is signifi cantly associated with vegetation-rich lands. A 10% increase in shrub, forest, and rain-fed cropland areas resulted in increased human SFTS incidence rates of 51%, 51%, and 90%, respectively. 163\n\nAdditionally, urbanisation has aff ected the emergence and increasing incidence of tick-borne diseases. Studies in Europe suggest that encroachment into forested and uncultivated areas, and protection of existing green spaces in the process of urbanisation, have created opportunities for ticks to survive in urban and especially suburban environments. The presence of many pets and domestic animals, which can serve as tick hosts and pathogen reservoirs, might help tick transmission of various human and animal pathogens. 164, 165 In the past three decades, China has gone through the most rapid urbanisation in its history. This rapid urbanisation, followed by widespread rural-to-urban migration of the human population, intensive longdistance trade, and explosive short-term travel for shopping, has led to substantial health risks including air pollution, occupational and traffi c hazards, and altered diets and activity. 166 All of these changes in human activity, together with increased contact between human beings and their pets and nature, have probably contributed to the increasing abundance of tick exposure, as reported in other developed countries. 164 Further investigation is needed to show the relation between emerging tick-borne diseases and urbanisation in mainland China.\n\nThe eff ect of worldwide climate change on the emergence of most vector-borne zoonotic diseases (including tick-borne diseases) is thought to be less important than changes in land use, animal host communities, human living conditions, and societal factors. 3 Although the eff ects of climate on transmission of infectious diseases are thought to be non-linear and act in opposing directions in diff erent climate regions, the seasonal dynamics of tick vectors are largely defi ned by climate conditions, which might further aff ect the seasonal pattern of tick-borne diseases. An increase in winter temperatures is known to cause the northward extension and increased abundance of Ixodes ricinus, which subsequently raises the risk of tick-borne disease dissemination. [167] [168] [169] Although this topic is still under debate, climatic change could have a role in the emergence of tick-borne diseases in China. Further studies are needed to better elucidate this issue.\n\nTicks are thought to be second only to mosquitoes as worldwide vectors of human infectious diseases. 170 Up to now, more than 120 tick species have been identifi ed in China, including over 100 species in the Ixodidae (socalled hard tick) family and 19 species in the Argasidae (soft tick) family. 171 They transmit several pathogens when feeding on a range of animals, including human beings as accidental hosts. About 30 tick species are reported to feed on human beings. 172, 173 The diverse geographical distribution and abundance of ticks are dependent on optimum environmental conditions and biotopes for each tick species, which defi ne the risk areas for corresponding tick-borne zoonoses. 3 In addition to the emerging tick-borne infections, previously documented and well established tick-borne diseases are a continuing threat to human health, including tick-borne encephalitis in northeastern China, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever in northwestern China, tularaemia and north-Asia tick-borne spotted fever in northern China, and Q fever, which is widely distributed throughout China. [174] [175] [176] [177] [178] [179] [180] [181] [182] [183] The non-specifi c clinical manifestations caused by tickborne pathogens, such as SFGR, Anaplasma species, B burgdorferi sensu lato, Babesia species, and SFTSV, present a major diagnostic challenge. Most physicians are unfamiliar with the many tick-borne diseases that present with non-specifi c symptoms in the early stages of the illness. The wide distributions of the 33 emerging tick-associated agents and their tick vectors, in addition to the diversity of tick species throughout mainland China, imply that reported cases of infection might be only the tip of the iceberg in regard to the actual number of tick-borne diseases. To develop a reasonable diff erential diagnosis and identify a specifi c pathogen, laboratory diagnostic methods that are rapid, convenient, and practical are urgently needed for these emerging tickborne diseases. Although great progress has been made in mainland China in the detection and identifi cation of various tick-borne pathogens and diagnosis of the infections they cause, the necessary technologies are still unavailable in most general hospitals. Unfortunately, the importance of tick-borne diseases to human and animal health has not been suffi ciently recognised as a result of inaccessibility to laboratory tests for aetiological diagnosis and inadequate surveillance activities.\n\nIn China, 18 tick-borne agents have been detected in ticks or animals, including four Rickettsia species, two Ehrlichia species, an Anaplasma species, three genospecies of B burgdorferi sensu lato, and eight Babesia species; however, the full eff ect of their pathogenicity to human\n\nWe searched PubMed and ISI Web of Science for articles published in English, and WanFang database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Chinese Scientifi c Journal Database for articles published in Chinese between Jan 1, 1980, and May 31, 2015. We used the following search terms: \"tick-borne disease\", \"tick-borne zoonosis\", \"tick-borne zoonotic disease\", \"tick-associated agent\", \"tick-associated microbe\", and \"China\", in combination with each of the fi ve genera of tick-borne agents. We did a secondary manual search of the references cited in these articles to fi nd relevant articles. We investigated all the articles related to detection, identifi cation, or infections of these fi ve genera of tick-borne microbes in human beings, ticks, and animals. We contacted the corresponding authors for detailed information such as the time of discovery, location, and origin of tick-borne agents if any of this information was missing in the articles.\n\nbeings is still to be established. Despite increasing knowledge about their geographical distribution, the natural cycle of these agents and the natural history of their infection in tick vectors and animal hosts have yet to be elucidated. Identifying human infections after potentially pathogenic agents are identifi ed in ticks could take many years, in part because the microbial loads are much lower in human blood than in arthropods. 184 For example, R sibirica sp BJ-90 was fi rst identifi ed in D sinicus ticks in China in 1990, 7 but was not discovered to infect human beings until 22 years later. 46 Similarly, A phagocytophilum was initially detected in China in 1997; 15 however, nosocomial transmission of human granulocytic anaplasmosis was not recognised until 10 years later. 73 As such, the 18 tick-associated agents that have been recognised in China in either ticks or animals represent potential candidates for new tick-borne human diseases. Likewise, a search for potential new pathogens in ticks is essential for the discovery of emerging tickborne diseases in human beings.\n\n33 tick species belonging to six genuses have been reported to be naturally infected with the emerging pathogenic agents described in this Review (fi gure 1). Except for eight species (Dermacentor abaensis, Dermacentor daghestanicus, Haemaphysalis bispinosa, H fl ava, Haemaphysalis sinensis, Haemaphysalis yeni, Ixodes myospalacis, and Rhipicephalus turanicus), most species carry two or more agents. Conversely, some emerging agents such as R heilongjiangensis, E chaff eensis, A phagocytophilum, and B garinii can infect several tick species. Additionally, tick-borne pathogens that infect domestic animals might eventually cause human disease. A representative example is B divergens, which has long been recognised to cause cattle babesiosis in Europe, and was subsequently identifi ed as a human pathogen. 185 In China, a wide range of emerging tick-borne agents are known to infect various domestic animals (appendix), and their potential capability to infect humans warrants great attention and further investigation. With the continued emergence of tick-borne diseases in mainland China, improving our understanding of the existence and health burden of these diseases is essential for China and for the rest of the world. \n\nWe declare no competing interests."}
