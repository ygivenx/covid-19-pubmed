{"title": "Recombination and lineage-specific mutations led to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2", "body": "In the three months since the initial reports in mid-December 2019, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has caused close to 10,000 fatalities associated with severe respiratory disease worldwide 1 . The causative agent of COVID-19 was identified as a previously unknown RNA coronavirus (CoV) virus, dubbed SARS-CoV-2, of the betacoronavirus genus 2 , with 80% similarity at nucleotide level to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 3 . SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are the only members of Sarbecovirus subgenus of betacoronavirus that are known to infect humans. Other members of this subgenus are frequently found in bats, hypothesized to be the natural reservoir of many zoonotic coronaviruses 4 . In January 2020, a Rhinolophus affinis bat isolate obtained in 2013 from the Yunnan Province in China (named RaTG13) was reported to have 96% similarity to SARS-CoV-2 5 , suggesting that the ancestors of the outbreak virus were recently circulating in bats. However, the specific molecular and evolutionary determinants that enable a virus like the recent ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 to jump species remain poorly characterized.\n\nThe capability of viral populations to emerge in new hosts can be explained by factors such as rapid mutation rates and recombination 6 which lead to both high genetic variability and high evolutionary rates (estimated to be between 10 -4 and 10 -3 substitutions per site per year) 7 . Previous genome-wide analyses in coronaviruses have estimated that their evolutionary rates are of the same order of magnitude as in other fast-evolving RNA viruses 8, 9 . Recombination in RNA viruses, known to be frequent in coronaviruses, can lead to the acquisition of genetic material from other viral strains 10 . Indeed, recombination has been proposed to play a major role in the generation of new coronavirus lineages such as SARS-CoV 10 .\n\nFurthermore, a recent study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 was involved in a potential recombination event between different members of the Sarbecovirus subgenus 2 .\n\nIn this work, we investigate the evolutionary events that characterize the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. In particular, we identify one recombination event in a region that determines host tropism, the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike gene, which led human SARS and SARS-CoV-2 to share a similar haplotype in the RBD. Through ancestral reconstruction analyses, we also observe that, subsequent to this recombination, a significant enrichment of nonsynymous changes occurred in SARS-CoV-2 after the split from its most recent common ancestor (MRCA) with RaTG13.\n\nTo understand how recombination contributes to the evolution of betacoronaviruses across different viral subgenera and hosts, we analyzed 45 betacoronavirus sequences from the five major subgenera Figure 1 ). This enrichment of recombination events persisted after restricting the analysis to the most common host (bats), suggesting that the recombination is not driven by sampling of multiple human sequences (Supplementary Figure 2 ). In all, we find that recombination in betacoronavirus frequently involves the Spike protein across viral subgenenera and hosts.\n\nTo study how recombination affects emerging human betacoronaviruses viruses at the viral species level, we focused our attention to the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), due to the extensive sampling both in humans and in camels (recognized as the source of the recent zoonosis 13 ).\n\nUsing 381 MERS-CoV sequences (170 from human, 209 from camel and 2 from bat) (Supplementary Table 2 Figure 4) . We thus show that the enrichment of recombination events involving the Spike gene is also observed at a viral species level.\n\nWe then asked if any signal of recombination could be found in the recent history of SARS-CoV-2. We Table 3 ), including four positions that are conserved in the human-infecting viral strains but that are not conserved in those infecting bats: 427N, 436Y, 455I and 466N. In summary, these results demonstrate, first of all, that SARS-CoV-2 displays a genotype similar to SARS-CoV in the RBD, and secondly, that these two lineages share a common history of recombination in the RBD.\n\nTo trace back the potential time of the recombination event involving ancestral lineages of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, we used a Bayesian Phylogenetic approach 14 in the recombinant region (codons 200-500 in the Spike gene) and compared with the whole genome phylogeny ( Figure 3b ). As in the full genome phylogeny, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 were in the same clade, with human SARS-CoV as an outgroup. In light of these results, there two possible scenarios to consider. The first is that SARS-CoV-2 derives from a recombination event between human SARS-CoV and another (unsampled) SARS-like CoV. The second is that there occurred at least two different recombination events, one leading to human SARS-CoV and another one leading to SARS-CoV-2. In either of these two scenarios, the inferred the time to the most recent common ancestor in the recombinant region of the clade leading to RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 is no later than 2009 (2003-2013, 95% HPD limit).\n\nWe highlight two mutations, 427N and 436Y, conserved in human SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and human- Table 4 ). Interestingly, a mouse-adapted SARS virus showed a mutation at position 436 (Y436H) that enhanced the replication and pathogenesis in mice 16, 17 , indicating that this change may have an effect in host tropism. It is noteworthy that unlike 436Y, 455I and 466N, the 427N mutation was present in the closest strains not . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Our ancestral state reconstructions also suggest that 427N has appeared at two other independent times in bat SARS-like CoVs, and only at external branches (sequences JX993988 and JX993987; Supplementary Figure 5 ). Other bat isolates with the 427N allele, such as Rs7327, Rs4874 and Rs4231, are known to co-opt the human ACE2 receptor 18 , further reinforcing the role of 427N as an adaptive mutation for the interaction with ACE2.\n\nWe compared the SARS-CoV-2 sequence to that of the genome-wide nearest bat CoV, namely RaTG13.\n\nThe distributions of nonsynonymous and 4-fold degenerate site changes between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 across the viral genome highlighted two regions with significant enrichment of nonsynonymous changes (adjusted p-val. < 10 -5 and p-val. < 10 -3 for the first and second regions respectively, binomial test on sliding windows of 267 amino acids) (Figure 4b ). The first region, with windows starting between positions 801 and 1067 in the Orf1a gene in our analysis, spans the non-structural proteins (nsp) 2 and 3 that were previously reported to accrue a high number of mutations between bat and SARS CoVs 19 and includes the ubiquitin-like domain 1, a glutamic acid-rich hypervariable region, and the SARS-unique domain of nsp3 20 that is critical to replication and transcription 21, 22 . The second region that we found with high divergence from the RaTG13 bat virus contained 27 substitutions in the Spike protein, of which 20 were located in the RBD (Supplementary Table 5 ). There was no significant enrichment in mutations observed at 4-fold degenerate sites ( Supplementary Figures 7-10 ).\n\nTrough ancestral state reconstruction, we then inferred the entire Spike sequence of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2. We assessed the changes that were specific to the lineage leading to SARS-CoV-2 and identified 32 substitutions (of which 2 only were in the RBD) at 4-fold degenerated sites, and 10 amino acid changes (of which 5 were in the RBD) which have likely occurred in the lineage leading to SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Table 6 ). Thus, we report a significant enrichment of nonsynonymous changes in the RBD (Fisher Exact Test: p-value =0.005; Odds Ratio = 13.6, 95% Confidence Interval = 1.7 -180.0). The five amino acid changes in RBD were I428L, A430S, K465T and Y484Q. Interestingly, position 484 has already been reported to directly interact with ACE2 23 .\n\n.

We suggest a twohit scenario involving both ancestral recombination and recent mutational events in the lineage that led to SARS-CoV-2. It has been hypothesized previously that recombination 8,24 and rapid evolution was observed between bat, civet and human SARS-CoVs 19 . We show that the recombination events preferentially affect the RBD region in the Spike gene, both at the order of genus (betacoronavirus) and In conclusion, our evolutionary analyses have revealed that the evolutionary processes leading to SARS-CoV-2 can be explained by a two-hit scenario of recombination and recent mutational events in the Spike.\n\nJ.P., I.F. and R.R. designed the study and prepared the manuscript.

As input, the ML tree derived from 3 rd codon positions at the RBD recombinant region was used. We then compared the distribution of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions along the branch specific to SARS-CoV-2.\n\nSliding window analysis was performed in order to test for enrichment of recombination breakpoints (including both start and end breakpoints) along the viral genome in the following settings: 1) all beta-CoV recombinations; 2) recombinations within non-human lineages for Beta-CoV; 2) all MERS-CoV recombinations; and 3) both human-specific and non-human MERS-CoV lineage recombinations separately. There were too few human-specific recombinations in beta-CoV for in-depth analysis. For beta-CoV analyses, the SARS-CoV genomic coordinates were used as reference (accession NC_004718), whereas for MERS CoVs, we used a MERS-CoV sequence (accession NC_019843) as reference. Windows of 800 nucleotides were selected and binomial tests for the number of breakpoints in each window were performed under the null hypothesis that recombination breakpoints are distributed uniformly along the genome. Given the co-dependence structure of our statistical tests, adjustments were performed using the Benjamini-Yekutieli (BY) procedure 34 which provides a conservative multiple hypothesis correction that applies in arbitrary dependence conditions. For statistical significance, we chose 5% BY false discovery rate (FDR). Our discoveries are valid with different choices of window length, provided the window length is sensitive to the scale CoV proteins and the length of specific domains such as the RBD in the Spike gene.\n\nWe used the same sliding window approach to test for enrichment of gene-specific nonsynonymous as well as synonymous differences between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat virus RaTG13. For consistency, we selected 267 length windows of amino acids (corresponding to approximately 800 nucleotides) and performed p-value correction using the same procedure.\n\n.
