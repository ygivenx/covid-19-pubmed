{"title": "Virology 50th Anniversary Special Issue: A Publisher's Note", "body": "and S.E. Luria acted as the main Editors. At that time, it was only 9 years since Salvador Luria and Alfred Hershey had demonstrated that bacteriophages mutate. Just 4 years beforehand, in 1950, Andr\u00e9 Lwoff, Louis Siminovitch, and Niels Kjeldgaard discovered lysogenic bacteriophage in Bacillus megaterium and coined the term prophage. In 1952, Renato Dulbecco demonstrated that animal viruses can form plaques in a similar way to bacteriophages, and in the same year, Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase showed that DNA was the genetic material of a bacteriophage. It was in this scientific environment that Virology was Fborn_ and became the first general journal in the field. It was a time in which the basic foundations were being laid, and it conjures a reminder that it is ''strange how much you've got to know before you know how little you know'' (Anon).\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s were the formative years for virology. In the year that Virology was launched, John Enders, Thomas Weller, and Frederick Robbins won the Nobel Prize for their work in growing poliovirus in vitro using human tissue culture, perhaps one of the most significant single events in the development of diagnostic virology. Many of the important achievements in the field were recognized with Nobel prizes, and virology can certainly claim to be ranked extraordinarily highly among scientific disciplines with the most frequent awards, with over 10 prizes to date directly relating to discoveries in virology, plus 2 relating to prions, awarded to 17 individuals.\n\nFollowing George K. Hirst as Editor in Chief was Bill Joklik, who honors us with an article in this issue describing the founding of the American Society for Virology. The present Editor in Chief, Robert Lamb, took over from Bill in 1994 and is therefore only the third to hold this role since the journal began. Over the years, the journal has been supported by its Editors, strengthened by their work and passionate involvement, and broadened and stimulated by their ideas. There are too many whose involvement we have enjoyed over the years to name, but readers may be interested to learn that for the first issue, apart from George K. Hirst Throughout this last half century, scientists and clinicians have submitted their best work to the journal, and we are proud to have published excellent work from scientists from around the world. Indeed, its achievements have only been possible through the intellectual input, hard work, dedication, and support of key figures in the field, who have devoted their time and energy to ensure that Virology continues to be one of the best vehicles for the dissemination of quality research. Their involvement as Editors, Editorial Board members, reviewers, and authors is gratefully acknowledged.\n\nSince the launch of Virology in 1954, many outstanding achievements in the field have been made, and the developments in our knowledge have been rapid, only outpaced perhaps by the ability of viruses to mutate, find new hosts, and otherwise present challenges for humankind. Alan Cann gives a brief overview of some of these historic advances in the new edition of his book (Cann, 2005) . Looking back, among the important milestones are the demonstration by Sydney Brenner, Fran\u00e7ois Jacob, and Matthew Meselson that bacteriophage T4 uses host-cell ribosomes to direct virus protein synthesis (1961), the discovery of hepatitis B virus in 1963 (Baruch Blumberg), and Mark Ptashne's isolation and study of the E repressor protein (1967). Howard Temin and David Baltimore's independent discovery of reverse transcriptase in retroviruses was made in 1970, followed 2 years later by Paul Berg's creation of the first recombinant DNA molecules, comprising circular SV40 DNA genomes containing E phage genes and the galactose operon of E. coli, an event that initiated the era of recombinant DNA technology. In 1973, Peter Doherty and Rolf Zinkernagel demonstrated the basis of antigenic recognition of the cellular immune system and the role of the major histocompatibility complex. Bernard Moss and Aaron Shatkin in 1975 showed in reovirus and vaccinia the role of the nucleotide cap at the 5V end of messenger RNA in affecting correct processing during translation, later found to apply to other cellular mRNAs. Also during the 1970s, J. Michael Bishop and Harold Varmus discovered the cellular basis of retroviral oncogenes that in 1989 was rewarded with the Nobel prize. Richard Roberts and, independently, Phillip Sharp discovered introns in adenovirus genes in 1977, and Frederick Sanger and colleagues determined the complete sequence of the bacteriophage AX174 genome also in that year.\n\nIn 1980, one of the major achievements of the 20th century was celebrated, with the World Health Organization's official declaration of the global eradication of smallpox, still the only instance of the eradication of a human infectious disease to the present day. In 1981, Yorio Hinuma isolated human T-cell leukemia virus, the first human cancer virus to be identified. The next year, Stanley Prusiner demonstrated that the infectious proteins he called prions could cause scrapie, the first step in our understanding of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. In 1983, Luc Montagnier and Robert Gallo announced the discovery of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the causative agent of AIDS. In 1985, a virus to vaccinate against swine herpes became the first genetically modified organism to be granted a license by the US Department of Agriculture. The following year, Roger Beachy and Rob Fraley published work that significantly improved the understanding of virus resistance (in this case tobacco mosaic virus) in plants, an important goal of plant breeders. 1989 brought the definitive identification of hepatitis C virus, and in 1993, the sequence of the smallpox virus genome was completed. Yuan Chang and Patrick Moore identified human herpesvirus 8, the causative agent of Kaposi's sarcoma, and in 2003, the newly discovered Mimivirus became the largest known virus, with a diameter of 400 nm and a genome of 1.2 Mbp, and in the same year, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) broke out in China, subsequently spreading around the world.\n\nOver these 50 years, Virology has published many thousands of papers that have chronicled or been instrumental in enabling these major steps forward. In total, there are presently over 21,500 articles available online, all the way back to Volume 1, Issue 1. Each one has been important in some way. Indeed, the articles published in Virology trace the intellectual evolution of the field. Compiling a list of the Fmost important_ papers, however, is an invidious task. Friendships can falter on such an undertaking, but perhaps, the most objective measure is the number of times a published paper is cited in other publications. This evaluation can of course be criticized for its bias towards papers describing novel techniques or methods. Arguably, older papers dominate because they have had more time in which to have been cited. On the other hand, the citation rates of these articles are also a measure of their persisting importance. On balance, it does represent a value in some way related to how often that paper has been used. With many caveats, the list of the 100 most-cited papers in Virology since records began is presented in Table 1 . Many of the papers have helped or influenced both a great many people and a great many subsequent advances in virology.\n\nAmong the many ground-breaking and fascinating articles published in Virology over the last 50 years are over 150 from 24 Nobel-prize-winning scientists, including Werner Arber, David Baltimore, J. Michael Bishop, Sydney Brenner, Peter C. Doherty, Renato Dulbecco, Gertrude B. Elion, John F. Enders, D. Carleton Gajdusek, Leland H. Hartwell, Alfred D. Hershey, Fran\u00e7ois Jacob, Neils K. Jerne, Arthur Kornberg, Andr\u00e9 Lwoff, Time will tell how many will be added in the coming decades.\n\nAs it enters its sixth decade, Virology continues to build upon this great foundation, publishing novel research, rapid communications and cogent reviews across the spectrum of modern virology. Indeed, last year, Virology was included in the FTop 10_ original research FHottest Journals of the Millennium (so far)_ compiled by Thomson Scientific and published in Science Watch. Indeed, the event celebrated in this issue -Virology's 50th birthday -is testimony to its impact and importance. Aided by the staggering advances in technology made over the last decade in particular, publication is faster than ever (currently just 3-5 weeks before publication of each article online, and 8 -10 weeks in print), and yet it retains its traditional high quality standards. Articles now have unprecedentedly high levels of accessibility and visibility. As further developments take place in the field, as we understand critical issues of virus structure, replication, pathogenicity, and develop more sophisticated tactics to counter and prevent disease, we anticipate that Virology will continue to play a leading role in documenting these important discoveries.\n\nWe look forward, as the scientific field, technology, and the world continues to change, to Virology remaining one of the most highly respected and the most consistently high quality journal in the field. It will be fascinating to continue the journey of scientific discovery, with Virology as our craft."}
