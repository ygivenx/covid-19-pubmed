{"title": "AIR TRAVEL", "body": "\u2022 People with ear, nose, and sinus infections or severe congestion may wish to temporarily avoid flying to prevent pain and injury. This is particularly true for infants and toddlers, in whom obstruction occurs more readily. \u2022 Oral pseudoephedrine 30 minutes before flight departure or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent may alleviate symptoms. \u2022 Travelers sensitive to abdominal bloating should avoid carbonated beverages and foods that can increase gas production. \u2022 Patients who have had recent surgery, particularly intra-abdominal, neurologic, intrapulmonary or intraocular procedures, should consult with their physicians before flying.\n\nAll commercial jet aircraft built after the late 1980s and a few modified older aircraft recirculate 10%-50% of the air in the cabin mixed with outside air. The recirculated air passes through a series of filters 20-30 times per hour. In most newer model airplanes, the recycled air passes through high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, which capture 99.9% of particles (bacteria, fungi, and larger viruses) between 0.1 and 0.3 microns. Air flow occurs horizontally across the plane in limited bands, and air is not forced up and down the length of the plane.\n\nCommunicable diseases may be transmitted to other travelers during air travel, therefore-\u2022 Persons who are acutely ill, or still within the infectious period for a specific disease, should be discouraged from traveling. \u2022 Travelers should be reminded to wash their hands frequently and cover their noses and mouths when coughing or sneezing.\n\nIf a passenger with a communicable disease is identified as having flown on a particular flight (or flights), passengers who may have been exposed will be contacted by public health authorities for possible screening or prophylaxis. For certain communicable diseases, public health authorities will obtain contact information from the airline for potentially exposed travelers so they may be contacted and offered appropriate intervention. To assist in this process, travelers can provide airlines with current contact information such as a telephone number and state of residence. Travel agencies will not share passenger contact information with the airline or public health authorities.\n\nwarranted when the ill traveler meets WHO criteria for being infectious during flight. The concern is greatest when a person may have flown with a highly resistant strain of TB. People known to have infectious TB should not travel by commercial air (or any other commercial means) until criteria for no longer being infectious are met. State health department TB controllers are valuable resources for advice (www.phf.org/ links.htm#State-Health).\n\nMeningococcal disease is potentially rapidly fatal, thus rapid identification of close contacts and provision of prophylactic antimicrobials are critical. Antimicrobial prophylaxis should be considered for-\u2022 household members traveling with a patient, \u2022 travel companions with close contact, and \u2022 passengers seated directly next to the ill traveler on flights of >8 hours.\n\nMost measles cases diagnosed in the United States are imported from countries where measles is endemic.\n\n\u2022 An ill traveler is considered infectious during a flight of any duration if he or she traveled during the 4 days before rash onset through 4 days after rash onset. \u2022 Intervention may prevent or mitigate measles in susceptible contacts if-MMR vaccine is given within 72 hours of flight exposure or Immunoglobulin is given within 6 days of flight exposure. \u2022 International travelers should ensure they are immune to measles prior to travel.\n\nTransmission of the influenza virus aboard aircraft has been documented, but data are limited. Transmission is thought to be primarily due to large droplets; therefore, passengers seated closest to the source case are believed to be most at risk for exposure (see the Influenza section in Chapter 2 and www.cdc.gov/flu for more information).\n\nThe avian influenza virus (H5N1) has infected hundreds of humans since 1997, primarily associated with direct contact with infected birds or bird products. No cases have yet been associated with air travel. See www.cdc.gov/travel for more general information and up-to-date, specific guidelines for travelers and the airline industry.\n\nSARS can potentially be transmitted anywhere people are gathered, including aircraft cabins. The last known case of person-to-person transmission occurred in 2003. If SARS were to re-emerge, www.cdc.gov/travel will provide up-to-date information for travelers and flight crews.\n\nTo reduce the accidental spread of mosquitoes and other vectors via airline cabins and luggage compartments, a number of countries require disinsection of all inbound flights. WHO and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) specify two approaches for aircraft disinsection-\u2022 Spraying the aircraft cabin with an aerosolized insecticide (usually 2% phenothrin) while passengers are on board \u2022 Treating the aircraft's interior surfaces with a residual insecticide while the aircraft is empty CHAPTER Some countries use a third method, in which aircraft are sprayed with an aerosolized insecticide while passengers are not on board. Disinsection is not routinely done on incoming flights to the United States. Although disinsection, when done appropriately, was declared safe by the WHO in 1995, there is still much debate about the safety of the agents and methods used. Guidelines for disinsection have been updated for the revised International Health Regulations (www2a.cdc.gov/phlp/docs/58assembly.pdf). Many countries, including the United States, reserve the right to increase the use of disinsection in case of increased threat of vector or disease spread. An updated list of countries that require disinsection and the types of methods used are available at the U.S. Department of Transportation website: (http://ostpxweb.ost.dot.gov/policy/safetyenergyenv/disinsection.htm).\n\nThe continued popularity of cruise travel, along with the expansion of cruise itineraries to areas not easily accessible otherwise, promotes the exposure of travelers to multiple global destinations in a short period of time. Passengers and crew from around the world bring together a diversity of cultures, medical risk factors, and health risk behaviors.\n\n\u2022 About \n\n\u2022 Densely populated, semi-enclosed cruise ship environments may permit repeated and prolonged exposure to communicable diseases, resulting in their transmission between passengers and crew members. \u2022 Differences in sanitation standards and disease prevalence between seaports may also lead to communicable disease exposure and spread. \u2022 The risk of acquiring an infectious disease during cruise travel is difficult to quantify due to the diverse activities of crew and passengers, as well as the wide range of potential disease exposures. \u2022 Senior citizens (an estimated one-third of cruise travelers) and travelers with underlying chronic health problems are at increased risk of illness from infections such as influenza, Legionella, and noroviruses. \u2022 Early detection and prevention of infectious diseases are important, not only to protect the health of cruise travelers, but also to avoid global dissemination of diseases in home communities through disembarking passengers and crew members.\n\nMedical facilities on cruise ships can vary, depending on the size of the ship, its itinerary, number of crew and passengers, and the mean age and health status of passengers. The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) Health Care Guidelines for Cruise Ship Medical Facilities is a consensus report on appropriate facilities and staffing requirements for basic shipboard medical and emergency services, given the recognized limitations of offshore environments. Shipboard health care recommended in these guidelines includes provision of-\u2022 A medical infirmary with licensed medical staff (physician and registered nurse) on call 24 hours per day \u2022 One intensive care unit (ICU) room \u2022 One bed per 1,000 passengers and crew members \u2022 One isolation room or the capability to isolate patients with communicable diseases \u2022 Emergency and portable medical equipment, such as a bag valve mask, oxygen tank, endotracheal tube, defibrillator, and a cardiac monitor or external cardiac pacer \u2022 Medications to handle medical emergencies \u2022 Basic diagnostic and laboratory supplies for blood chemistry analyses, complete blood counts, urinalyses, chest x-rays, and electrocardiograms (EKGs) \u2022 A medical record and communication system \u2022 Health, hygiene, and safety program for medical personnel Large cruise lines that operate in the United States or are members of Cruise Lines International Organization (CLIA) meet or exceed ACEP guideline standards. However, medical care on these ships should be equated to that of community urgent-care centers, not full-service hospitals. Small ships or those run by independent ship operators may not follow the ACEP guidelines. Therefore, on such ships, medical provisions might not be available onboard.\n\nIn a retrospective study of four cruise ship medical logs maintained by a major cruiseline, 7,147 new patient visits occurred among 196,171 cruise passengers on 172 voyages.\n\n\u2022 Over half of shipboard infirmary visits are made by passengers over the age of 65. \u2022 The most common diagnosis was respiratory tract infection (29.1%), followed by injuries (18.2%), seasickness (9.1%), and gastrointestinal (GI) illness (8.9%). \u2022 An estimated 95% of illnesses seen in cruise ship medical facilities can be treated onboard. However, passengers with serious problems, such as myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accidents, need to be transferred to shoreside hospitals after stabilization.\n\nCommunicable diseases occurring onboard cruise ships are similar to those that occur onshore. Detecting illnesses of public health significance is aided by heightened cruise line surveillance efforts in cooperation with public health authorities, and passenger reporting.\n\n\u2022 The most frequently documented cruise ship outbreaks involve respiratory infections (influenza and Legionella) and gastrointestinal infections (norovirus). \u2022 In the past decade, clusters of illnesses due to vaccine-preventable diseases other than influenza, such as rubella and varicella (chickenpox), have also been reported.\n\n\u2022 Outbreaks of influenza A and B can occur year-round, despite seasonality in the destination regions for cruises. \u2022 Respiratory illness outbreaks usually result from the importation of influenza by embarking passengers and crew; the infection subsequently spreads person to person on the ship. \u2022 Onboard control measures include isolation, infection control, and antiviral treatment of ill individuals as well as those exposed to the illness. \u2022 One of the largest and most protracted influenza outbreaks occurred among landand sea-based tourists to Alaska and the Yukon during the summer of 1998.\n\n\u2022 Legionnaires' disease has led to pneumonia outbreaks on multiple occasions, sometimes on consecutive cruises. \u2022 Although contaminated ships' whirlpool spas and potable water supply systems are the most commonly implicated sources of Legionella outbreaks, exposure to other sources may also occur during port stops. \u2022 Pinpointing the source of these outbreaks has proved difficult because diagnoses in returned travelers may be delayed and clinical specimens may be unavailable for culture at the time of diagnosis. \u2022 Culture-based diagnostic tests for cruise travel-associated Legionnaires' disease are of public health importance. \u2022 Improvements in ship design and standardization of spa and water supply disinfection have reduced the risk of Legionella growth and colonization.\n\nThe estimated likelihood of contracting gastroenteritis on an average 7-day cruise is less than 1%. GI illness accounts for fewer than 10% of shipboard passenger infirmary visits. In recent years, outbreaks of gastroenteritis on cruise ships have increased, despite good cruise ship environmental health standards.\n\n\u2022 The increase in gastroenteritis on cruise ships is primarily attributed to noroviruses, also the main cause of acute viral gastroenteritis in the United States. \u2022 Large, consecutive cruise ship outbreaks have resulted from noroviruses, due to theirlow infective dose, easy person-to-person transmissibility, and ability to survive routine cleaning procedures. \u2022 Prompt implementation of disease control measures, such as the isolation of ill persons, strict application of food and water sanitation measures, and disinfection of surfaces with suitable disinfectants, are key to controlling norovirus outbreaks.\n\nOther known causes of GI illness clusters on cruise ships include food or water contaminated with Salmonella spp., enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., Vibrio spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Cyclospora sp., and Trichinella spiralis.\n\nOther than influenza, clusters of rubella and varicella have been investigated on cruises originating in the United States, highlighting the potential global dissemination of vaccine-preventable diseases through cruise travel.\n\n\u2022 During a cruise ship outbreak investigation of rubella, 11% of the crew was found to be acutely infected with or susceptible to rubella and 33% of passengers onboard were women of childbearing age-a high-risk group for congenital rubella syndrome if infected during pregnancy. \u2022 One investigation of varicella outbreak aboard a cruise ship found that 13% of the crew, most foreign-born from tropical countries, were either acutely infected or susceptible. \u2022 Vaccine administration to crew members without documented immunity to vaccinepreventable diseases and notification of all passengers at risk for exposure serve as important control measures.\n\n\u2022 Are among the most common reasons for passengers to seek medical care on cruise ships. \u2022 Account for about 18% of passenger infirmary visits. \u2022 Occurring most frequently on cruise ships include sprains, contusions, and superficial wounds.\n\n\u2022 Is also a common reason for cruise passenger infirmary visits. \u2022 May not be reduced by the central location of a cabin. \u2022 See the Motion Sickness section in Chapter 2 for more information.\n\n\u2022 Cruise ship travelers with chronic health conditions may experience complications due to-Climatic variations Environmental exposure to pollutants Changes in diet and physical activity levels An increased level of stress due to being in an unfamiliar environment \u2022 Special cruises are available for travelers with certain medical conditions, including persons on dialysis.\n\nDue to multiple port visits and potential exposures, cruise ship travelers may be uncertain about which prevention medications, immunizations, and behaviors are appropriate for them and for their itineraries. Pre-travel advice for cruise ship travelers should include a complete review of the health status of the traveler, duration of travel, countries to be visited, and shore side activities. Box 6-1 summarizes recommendations for cruise travelers CHAPTER and health-care providers advising cruise travelers in pre-travel preparation and healthy behaviors during travel.\n\nHealth-care providers can contribute to healthy cruise ship environments by questioning ill returned travelers about recent cruise vacations and promptly reporting any suspected communicable disease to public health authorities.\n\nContacts for concerns about illnesses on cruise ships:\n\n\u2022 GI illnesses concerns should be directed to CDC Vessel Sanitation Program-Phone: 800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636) E-mail: CDCINFO@cdc.gov \u2022 Other illnesses suggestive of a communicable disease should be reported to the nearest CDC quarantine station with jurisdiction nearest to the cruise ship's port of arrival. \u2022 Cruise ship itinerary, including planned activities at port stops. \u2022 Travelers' underlying medical conditions.\n\n\u2022 Routine age-specific vaccines.\n\n\u2022 Destination-and activity-specific recommendations or required vaccines. Note: Proof of yellow fever vaccine may be required for entry into certain countries.\n\n\u2022 Antimalarial (consider risks at port stops). \u2022 Antiviral (for travelers at high risk of severe influenza).\n\n\u2022 Motion sickness medication.\n\n\u2022 Antibiotic for travelers' diarrhea.\n\n\u2022 Written summary of medical history-including pertinent diagnostics, such as EKG and chest x-ray,\n\nto facilitate overseas medical care should it be required.\n\n\u2022 Vaccines and prescriptions given.\n\n\u2022 Assess cruise ship medical facilities, sanitation scores, and presence of acute gastroenteritis outbreaks.\n\n\u2022 Cruise ship travelers with chronic diseases, special needs, or those who may require comprehensive medical care during travel should notify the cruise line of special needs before travel (e.g., wheelchair access, oxygen tank, and dialysis needs).\n\n\u2022 Ensure adequate medical insurance coverage for receiving health care overseas and medical evacuation (see the Travel Insurance and Evacuation Insurance section in Chapter 2).\n\n\u2022 Wash hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based gel containing at least 60% alcohol.\n\n\u2022 Practice respiratory hygiene by using a tissue to cover coughs and sneezes.\n\n\u2022 Take food and water precautions by eating foods that are thoroughly cooked and of appropriate temperature.\n\n\u2022 Prevent mosquito and other insect bites by using DEET or picaridin-containing repellents and clothing that provides complete coverage.\n\n\u2022 Use sun protection and drink plenty of water to avoid heat-related illness.\n\n\u2022 Other-avoid excessive alcohol, get plenty of rest, avoid contact with ill persons and report illnesses to cruise staff, and practice safe sex. \n\n\u2022 Travelers should be cautioned about the risks of motor-vehicle injuries during travel, including those caused by unfamiliar road environments, poorly maintained roads, and unavailable passenger restraints. This is especially important for travelers visiting less-developed countries. \u2022 Travelers should be advised to use seatbelts and child restraints, take mass transportation such as trains and subways whenever possible, avoid road travel at night, avoid drinking and driving, avoid speeding, and wear helmets when riding bicycles, mopeds, and motorcycles (see the Injuries and Safety section in Chapter 2).\n\n\u2022 Travelers should be advised that the use of alcohol or illicit drugs may increase the risk of assault or injuries, including drowning. It is advisable for them to swim in areas supervised by a lifeguard if at all possible. \u2022 Personal flotation devices should be used by adults and children, while operating personal watercraft, and during whitewater boating, waterskiing, and sailboarding.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State offers the following guidance for reduction of crime, including homicide. Travelers should take the following precautions:\n\n\u2022 Avoid drawing personal attention when traveling by not wearing expensive clothes or jewelry. \u2022 Carry as little baggage as possible, so movement can be quick and easy. \u2022 Leave valuables at home, or at least keep them well hidden. \u2022 Use travelers' cheques and credit cards rather than carrying large quantities of cash. \u2022 Avoid short cuts, narrow alleys, or poorly lit streets. \u2022 Do not travel alone at night. \u2022 Avoid discussing travel plans with strangers. \u2022 Never attend public demonstrations and civil disturbances. \u2022 Beware of pickpockets who might jostle or try to distract. \u2022 Know how to use a local telephone, and have emergency numbers readily available. \u2022 Give up valuables or car if confronted. \u2022 Keep hotel doors locked at all times and meet visitors in the lobby. \u2022 Do not get in an elevator alone with suspicious-looking persons. \u2022 Do not accept food or drink from strangers.\n\nFor detailed information on safety abroad, the State Department's website, Safe Trip Abroad, is extremely helpful (see http://travel.state.gov/travel/tips/safety/safety_1747.html). For additional assistance, U.S. Embassies or Consulates can give assistance or referrals to local services.\n\n\u2022 Psychological problems are not uncommon in travelers, and often travel can precipitate problems that had been previously masked. See the Mental Health and Travel section in Chapter 2 for more detailed information. Fortunately, suicide can be prevented. People who are experiencing thoughts of suicide should get help as soon as possible.\n\nDeath During Travel \n\nPersons wishing to import human remains, including cremated remains, into the United States must obtain clearance from CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine (DGMQ).\n\n\u2022 Clearance can be obtained by presenting copies of the foreign death certificate and if needed, a CDC/DGMQ permit to the CDC Quarantine Station with jurisdiction for the U.S. port of entry. \u2022 A CDC/DGMQ permit may be needed to import human remains if the deceased is known or suspected to have died from a quarantinable communicable disease. \u2022 A copy of the foreign death certificate and the CDC/DGMQ permit must accompany the human remains at all times during shipment. The foreign death certificate should state the cause of death and must be translated into English.\n\nThe U.S. mortician handling the remains is subject to the regulations of state and local health authorities for interstate and intrastate shipment. The U.S. mortician handling the importation and disposition of the remains will afterwards submit a letter to CDC/DGMQ certifying that the human remains were imported, handled, and disposed of according to the terms of the CDC permit. \n\nFederal regulations also give CDC the authority to restrict the importation of the remains of a person who died of a nonquarantinable communicable disease when necessary to prevent the spread of communicable disease.\n\ndog's care. If the dog is allowed out of its enclosure, the owner must muzzle the dog and use a leash. \u2022 The dog must be vaccinated within 4 days of arrival at its destination and remain in confinement for at least 30 days after the date of vaccination. \u2022 The dog may not be sold or transferred from the responsibility of the importer during the time of confinement. \u2022 A copy of the confinement agreement (Form CDC 75.37) can be found on the CDC website at www.cdc.gov/yellowbook/ConfinementAgreement. \u2022 Puppies <3 months of age are not considered old enough for rabies vaccination.\n\nPuppies <3 months of age may be admitted provided the importer completes a confinement agreement, vaccinates the animal at 3 months of age, and keeps the animal in confinement for at least 30 days after vaccination. \n\n\u2022 Turtles can transmit Salmonella to humans, and because small turtles are often kept CHAPTER For example, goatskin souvenirs (such as goatskin drums) from Haiti have been associated with human anthrax cases, and CDC restricts these items from entry into the United States.\n\nPotentially infectious nonhuman primate trophies may be imported only with a permit issued by CDC and must be taken to a USDA-licensed taxidermist for processing. More information on import restrictions for nonhuman primate trophies may be found at www.cdc.gov/od/ohs/biosfty/ IP_NHP_Guidance013004.pdf. \u2022 In some circumstances, restricted items may be admitted with a permit from CDC for scientific, educational or exhibition purposes (see www.cdc.gov/od/eaipp/).\n\nThe goal of these restrictions is to prevent the importation into the United States of communicable diseases transmissible from animals to humans or other animals. Persons who violate these requirements may be subject to criminal and/or civil penalties. For additional information regarding importation of these animals, travelers should be advised to contact CDC, Attention: Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, Mailstop E03, Atlanta, Georgia 30333 (404-639-3441), or visit www.cdc.gov/yellowbook/ AnimalFaq. Travelers planning to import horses, ruminants, swine, poultry, birds, and dogs used for handling livestock should be advised to contact the USDA Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (301-734-8364) or at www.aphis.usda.gov regarding additional requirements.\n\nTravelers planning to import fish, reptiles, spiders, wild birds, rabbits, bears, wild members of the cat family, or other wild or endangered animals should be advised to contact FWS (800-358-1949) or at www.fws.gov/le.\n\nTravelers planning to take a companion animal to a foreign country should be advised to meet the entry requirements of the country of destination and transportation guidelines of the airline. To obtain this information, travelers should contact the country's embassy in Washington, D.C., or the nearest consulate (see www.state.gov/s/cpr/rls/fco/).\n\nThere are several ways to travel with a companion animal. The animal may be allowed in the cabin if it meets certain size and weight restrictions, may be checked in with luggage, or may be placed into cargo. Travelers intending to bring their pets onboard with them should check with the airline for space and size/weight restrictions. For the health of the animal, pets are allowed to travel in checked luggage or cargo only if weather conditions permit. The airline will be able to help determine the best dates and times for traveling with pets.\n\nTaking Animals Across International Borders 427"}
