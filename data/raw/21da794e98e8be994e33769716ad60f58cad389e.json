{"title": "Morbidity and mortality amongst Indian Hajj pilgrims: A 3-year experience of Indian Hajj medical mission in mass-gathering medicine", "body": "The Hajj pilgrimage exemplifies one of the world's largest peaceful mass-gatherings fostering globalization in a multicultural environment. The five critical days of Hajj witness simultaneous congregation of over 3.5 million Hajj pilgrims from 200 countries in a harsh hot desert climate either unsheltered or in tent accommodation, with limited human assistance. The ever-increasing numbers of pilgrims pose a challenge to global health security along with housing, food, water, transportation, communication, sanitation, crowd-control and security. Mass-gathering medicine at Hajj is challenged by issues of high morbidity, healthcare accessibility, patient management and evacuation especially in emergencies [1] [2] [3] .\n\nThe Indian Medical Mission extends health security to approximately 140,000 Indian pilgrims annually through outreach medical teams, primary-care clinics, tent-clinics and secondary-care hospitals in Mecca, Medina and Jeddah. The endeavour encompasses mass-gathering and travel-medicine perspectives, the reflections of which are presented through this ambispective study on morbidity and mortality amongst Indian pilgrims.\n\nFor Hajj-2016, the Indian Medical Mission comprising of 144 doctors and 146 paramedics, established, operated and coordinated a tiered healthcare network including primary-care static-clinics, tent-clinics and mobile medical task-forces; secondary-care hospitals; referral and evacuation capabilities; at Mecca, Medina and Jeddah from Aug to Oct 2016. (a) Twenty-two static-clinics having 5-6 doctors, 5-6 paramedics per shift and basic first-aid capabilities catered for 6000-9000 pilgrims/clinic extending medical cover to 400 buildings in Mecca, Medina and Jeddah, and onward referral to secondary-care hospitals. (b) 35 tent-clinics having one doctor, one paramedic per shift and medical attendance facilities only, catered for 3000-4000 pilgrims/clinic extending medical cover to total of 5000 tents in Mina and Arafat, as well as 1.4 million unsheltered pilgrims in Muzdalifah. (c) One mobile referral tent-clinic having 5-6 doctors, 5-6 paramedics per shift at Mina and Arafat during the five critical days of Hajj catered to 35 satellite tentclinics. (d) Mobile medical task-forces having one doctor and two paramedics per shift covered mass-gathering congregations along the pilgrimage assemblage expected to have 5000-100,000 Indians. Onward referral was to secondary-care or tertiary-care Saudi hospitals. (e) Two 40-bedded secondary-care referral hospitals having 8-10 doctors, 8-10 paramedics per shift catered to 13 staticclinics in Mecca, a 14-bedded facility catered to five static-clinics in Medina. Secondary-care referral hospitals catered for critical care, internal medicine, general surgery, orthopaedics, gynaecology, paediatrics, psychiatry, dermatology, isolation, lab-medicine and radiology. (f) Tertiary-care transfers were coordinated with 30 Saudi-Arabian hospitals in Mecca, Medina and Jeddah. Data on medical attendance, bed-occupancy, procedures, investigations, referrals, medication usage and deaths for 2016 was compiled and compared with previous years.\n\nThe Indian Medical Mission provided health-security to approximately 400,000 patients in a period of 60 days from Aug to Oct 2016 by a team of 144 doctors including 50 specialists, 146 paramedics and 74 ancillary staff. Table 1 .\n\nInfectious disease was the most common (53.26%) outpatient diagnosis. Upper and lower respiratory infections, gastroenteritis and diabetes related skin and soft-tissue infections were seen. Respiratory infections outnumbered all other forms of illness. 90% healthcare personnel reported respiratory infections presenting as cough and viral prodrome, sometimes leading to sickness absenteeism. Upper respiratory infections presented as throat pain, sinusitis or otitis after a viral prodrome resembling common-cold or influenza like illness. Lower respiratory infections presented with productive cough, dyspnoea and fever more so in pre-existing lung conditions such as bronchial asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Acute gastroenteritis presented with vomiting and diarrhoea, with a history of food intake from multiple sources. Diabetic patients largely presented with pneumonia and cellulitis foot. There was inadequate glycemic control at presentation due to poor medication and precautionary compliance despite prescriptions of insulin and oral antihyperglycemics from India. Urinary tract infections (UTI) were found to have a predilection for female sex, diabetes and benign prostatic hypertrophy. Orthopaedic, trauma and musculoskeletal diseases included fractures, dislocations, myalgia, osteoarthritis, sprains, low backache, sciatica and crush injuries. 45% of all fractures were Colle's fracture due to fall on outstretched hand from escalators, beds or washroom flooring. Blunt trauma during mass-gatherings led to shoulder dislocation and chest wall injuries. Myalgia, osteoarthritis, sciatica and low backache precipitated due to stress, exertion, dehydration and old age. Crush injuries and metatarsal fracture occurred from overstepping of feet and wheelchairs during moving assemblage.\n\nAcute myocardial infarction, congestive cardiac failure (CCF) and angina were frequently encountered cardiovascular diseases. COPD and asthma were common respiratory diseases of non-infectious aetiology. Complications of COPD with cardiomegaly and CCF were seen. Complications of diabetes mellitus such as diabetic foot and cellulitis were seen. Acute urinary retention due to prostatic hypertrophy in geriatric patients needed catheterization. Abnormal heavy uterine withdrawal bleeding due to deliberately delayed menstruation was seen. Mean percentage of psychiatric diseases was 0.006%. Stress related disorders, acute psychosis, anxiety, phobia, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder; behaviour, mood and sleep disturbances were common. 16.67% psychiatric patients were hospitalized under secondary-care. Heat illness predominantly heat-hyperpyrexia (28 males and 20 females) and heat-exhaustion (24 males and 11 females) was seen in tent-clinics, some of which presented with delirium. Drug induced gastritis was common after self-medication of analgesics and antimicrobials. Various forms of de novo contact dermatitis and intertrigo along with pre-existing chronic skin conditions were seen. Most common pre-existing conditions were diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( Table 2) . 29.20% in-patients were treated in secondary-care for gastrointestinal disorders followed by 20.90% for respiratory diseases (Table 3 ). Most secondary-care hospitalizations were done for Table 4 . Frequent referrals for tertiary care were made for acute myocardial infarction, congestive cardiac failure, unstable angina, arrhythmia, COPD with complications, severe pneumonia, hemiparesis, chronic kidney disease, heat stroke, diabetic foot requiring amputations, fractures requiring internal/external fixation, advanced investigations and imaging. 21% were referred to tertiary-care for cardiovascular diseases followed by 16.80% for orthopaedic surgeries. Most of the referred cases had pre-existing (Table 3) . Few patients of Chronic Kidney Disease on maintenance hemodialysis attempting Hajj were hemodialyzed at Saudi hospitals. Crude unadjusted mortality amongst pilgrims was 11.99/10,000 compared to 27.02/10,000 in 2015. 24 Out of 163 deaths, there were 112 males and 51 females. Most common terminal event was cardiorespiratory arrest. Risk factors associated with high morbidity were old age and pre-existing comorbidities (Table 5 ).\n\nThe present study highlights high medical usage rates in staticclinics compared to tent-clinics which is attributable to longer duration of establishment of static-clinics compared to five days for tent-clinics. It also emphasizes upon an important role of mobile medical task force which catered to medical emergencies on-site. The secondary-care and tertiary-care medical usage rates exemplify that most patients report with low acuity complaints which can be handled in primary-care, provided it is accessible to Hajj pilgrims. Similar age, sex, comorbidity and admission profile has been reported by other studies [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Overwhelming surge of patients is a triple edged challenge. One, it downgrades standards of care, compromises resource security and patient satisfaction. Two, it facilitates transmission and acquisition of communicable infections. Three, it leads to stress induced physical, mental and compassion fatigue amongst healthcare personnel.\n\nInfectious disease including respiratory and gastrointestinal infections poses a huge burden to Hajj health system and a threat to healthcare professionals and public-health security [3, [5] [6] [7] . There are operational challenges at diagnosis, therapy and control of globalization of potentially multiresistant pathogens [2, [11] [12] [13] . The prevalence of respiratory symptoms has been found to be as high as 77.60% amongst Hajj pilgrims which can lead to epidemics and pandemics [14] . Increased post-Hajj prevalence of respiratory viruses from 7.40 to 45.40%, and bacteria from 15.40 to 31%, and consequent globalization has been proven [2, 14, 15] . Overcrowding during mass-gatherings increases the risk of transmission of respiratory pathogens such as rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and other coronaviruses, influenza A H1N1, influenza B, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, enterovirus, multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB), Streptococcus pneumoniae during \"Hajjcough\". Ebola, MERS, Alkhumra viral haemorrhagic fever, and Rift Valley Fever have high outbreak potential during Hajj. Both pandemic and seasonal influenza are simultaneously transmitted during Hajj [16] . In turn, this also leads to increased antibacterial prescription, increased self-medication, empiricism and incompleted antimicrobial regimens, furthering the emergence of multiresistant bacteria. Prescription audit and promotion of nonpharmaceutical preventive measures are mandated, however it remains a resource intensive effort in the realm of mass-gathering medicine. Syndromic surveillance can form early warning outbreak detection system, however it may have limitations due to short duration of diseases, asymptomatic carriage of pathogens, oligosymptomatic presentation, under-reporting to healthcare facility by patients, and inter-observer variation in research cohorts [2, 14, 17] .\n\nGeriatric pilgrims are prone to minimal insults due to low physiological reserves. Physically demanding rituals attempted by elderly under analgesic abuse leads to gastrointestinal problems, drowsiness; worsens hypertension, renal and liver functions; and increases the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. Outdoor pilgrimage rituals are associated with dehydration, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and sunburn. Multiple comorbidities seen in approximately 20% patients represent a big burden on tertiary-care Saudi hospitals and form the main risk factor for mortality during Hajj [8, 14, 16, [18] [19] [20] [21] . Diabetic patients are prone to heat illness, cellulitis and respiratory infections due to poor glycaemic control, relative immunocompromised state, peripheral neuropathy and autonomic dysfunction [19] . Other studies have reported surgery, orthopaedics and trauma related issues during Hajj [3, 10, 14, 18, 19] . Various psychiatric disorders observed in the study have rarely been reported during Hajj [14, 18] . Extreme heat, overcrowding, physical exertion, dehydration, language barriers, tough living conditions and being in a foreign country for a long duration precipitates stress related problems [3] .\n\nThough the history of Hajj pilgrimage is replete with disasters such as stampedes, building collapse, fires and accidents leading to polytrauma and mass-mortality; the Hajj-2016 was astoundingly successful on various fronts. There were no unmanageable crowds and disasters. Saudi Arabia, in association with the Global Centre for Mass gatherings, has boosted infrastructure and logistics while reducing the number of pilgrims for Hajj from 4 million to 3 million, and Indian pilgrims from 2.5 million to 1.4 million in 2016 accordingly, for better control of situational complexity. Disaster risk reduction measures have been adopted by alteration in space, scope and time, in situations such as crowd around a religious, food distribution or entry/exit spot.\n\nMortality in Indian Hajj pilgrims is largely attributable to patient-specific causes comparable with pilgrims of other countries, due to large geriatric population with pre-existing health conditions [2, 14, [21] [22] [23] . Environment-specific mortality is due to heat illness and incident-specific mortality may be due to incidents such as 2015 stampede causing death of 103 Indian pilgrims amongst overall toll of approximately 1200.\n\nOverwhelming surge of patients facilitates transmission of communicable infections and leads to stress induced physical, mental and compassion fatigue amongst healthcare personnel. Respiratory infections are highly prevalent and easily transmissible during Hajj leading to significant morbidity, increased burden to existing health facilities, overwhelming costs on health systems and globalization of multiresistant pathogens. Diabetic patients should avoid heat exposure and use protective footwear during Hajj rituals.\n\nMass-gathering medicine at Hajj can be optimized by improving patient knowledge on performing Hajj at a younger age, medicine compliance, avoiding self-medication, self-monitoring of hypertension, blood glucose, and preventive health measures; screening of pre-existing comorbidities; and resource augmentation with telemedicine networks and decision-support systems.\n\nNo funding sources."}
