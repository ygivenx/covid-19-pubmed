{"title": "Detection of airborne viruses using electro-aerodynamic deposition and a field-effect transistor", "body": "Figure 2(a) shows an optical image of a pristine single-walled carbon nanotube FET (swCNT-FET), which was obtained using optical microscopy (Sunny, Korea). Source and drain (Au/Pd electrodes) and SiO2 film functionalized with octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) are clearly evident in the image. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to reveal the CNT structures in the channel region. Figure 2(b) clearly shows CNTs, which form a 5-\u03bcm-wide and 20-\u03bcm-long channel aligned between the source and drain electrodes.\n\nStability and uniformity tests of the swCNT-FET were carried out. For the stability test, the temporal variation of source-drain current in the swCNT-FET was measured for 15 minutes and found to be negligible (Fig. 3 (a)). For the uniformity test, seventy-six swCNT-FET samples were fabricated and the distribution in conductance was measured. Figure 3 (b) shows that the distribution followed a log-normal function, which is typical for percolating conductive networks2627, and that the conductance was between 5 \u00d7 10\u22128 S and 1 \u00d7 10\u22126 S for 88% of the samples.\n\nThe particle size distribution was measured following aerosolization of a solution containing virus and antibody particles, and removal of moisture. Figure 4 shows three different size distributions obtained for solutions containing the MS2 bacteriophage virus, the antibodies for the MS2 bacteriophage, and mixture of both particles. The quantity of virus particles in the virus solution was controlled to be the same as that of the antibody particles in the antibody solution. The virus, antibody, and virus\u2013antibody bound particles had modal diameters of 24 nm, 23 nm and 46 nm, respectively, and the total number concentrations were 6.7 \u00d7 105 #/cm3, 6.72 \u00d7 105 #/cm3, and 5.94 \u00d7 105 #/cm3. Note that the virus and antibody particles were similar in size, and thus similar in terms of the total number concentration. When the mixed solution was aerosolized, the particle size distribution shifted toward larger particles, as expected; however, the total number concentration decreased compared with that obtained using the virus solution or antibody solution. This may be due to the fact that polyclonal antibodies were used, and so it is possible that unbound virus and antibody particles were present in the mixed solution.\n\nAfter the particles were aerosolized, they were electrically charged using a corona charger. The charged particles entered the nozzle, and were accelerated at the exit with a velocity of 1.17 m/s, and impinged on the substrate. We have previously shown24 that the deposition domain on the substrate is circular, and that the diameter (or width) of the deposition domain is given by:\n\n\n\nwhere W is the width of the nozzle width and Es is the electrostatic number; i.e.,\n\n\n\nwhere e = 1.6 \u00d7 10\u221219 C is the elementary charge, E is the electric field strength, \u03bc is the viscosity of air, U is the air velocity at the nozzle, d is the particle diameter, and CC is the Cunningham slip correction factor; i.e.25,\n\n\n\nwhere \u03bb is the mean free path of air molecules (66 nm). The average charge number of particles, n, was determined both theoretically and experimentally; details of this can be found in the \u2018Methods\u2019 section.\n\nThe average charge numbers were calculated using Eq. (5) (see the \u2018Methods\u2019 section); these were 3.31 for the virus, 3.16 for the antibody and 6.63 for the virus\u2013antibody bound particles. These numbers are in good agreement with those obtained experimentally using Eq. (4); i.e., 3.05, 2.97, and 6.79, respectively. Therefore, we found that the virus and antibody particles had a similar charge number in addition to their similar size.\n\nThe deposition widths for the aerosolized particles were calculated using Eq. (1); we find Wp = 14.1 mm for the virus, Wp = 13.9 mm for the antibodies and Wp = 17.4 mm for the virus\u2013antibody bound particles. The deposition widths were measured using a digital camera (D80, Nikon, Japan). A black enclosure was installed near the deposition location to shield the region form external light. The measured deposition widths were 14.6 mm for the virus, 14.1 mm for the antibodies and 18 mm for the virus\u2013antibody bound particles. Therefore, the measured data were in good agreement with the results of the calculations. Figure 5 also shows scanning electron microscope (SEM) images for four deposition spots. As shown in Fig. 5(a,b), the virus and antibodies were deposited as single particles. Virus, antibodies and virus\u2013antibody bound particles co-existed in Zone 1 (Wp < 14.6 mm; see Fig. 5(c1)); however, only virus\u2013antibody bound particles existed in Zone 2 (14.6 mm \u2264 Wp \u2264 18 mm; see Fig. 5(c2)). Therefore, the swCNT-FET channel was located in Zone 2 in subsequent experiments.\n\nAdditional experiments were carried out using antibodies specific for the H1N1 virus, and not for the target bacteriophage MS2 virus. Figure 6(a) shows the size distribution of the aerosolized antibodies for the H1N1 virus. The particles had a modal diameter of 11 nm and a total number concentration of 6.58 \u00d7 105 #/cm3. A solution containing the target bacteriophage MS2 virus and antibodies for the H1N1 virus was prepared and aerosolized, and the aerosolized particles were electro-aerodynamically deposited. The deposition width was 14.4 mm (Fig. 6(b)), which is almost identical to that for the virus deposition shown in Fig. 5(a). Figure 6(c) shows an SEM image of deposition; single particles can be seen deposited on the substrate, and particle agglomeration was not observed. It follows that no change in the size of the particles due to binding between the target bacteriophage MS2 virus and the antibodies for H1N1 occurred.\n\nFigure 7 shows the source\u2013drain current as a function of the gate voltage (i.e., I-V characteristics of the swCNT-FET) before and after the deposition of the virus\u2013antibody bound particles. Figure 7 shows a dramatic decrease in the current following deposition of virus\u2013antibody bound particles. When the number concentration ratio of virus to antibody was 1:0 or 0:1, the current did not change from that measured with no particle deposition (control value). However, when the ratios were 0.01:1, 0.05:1, and 0.1:1, the current decreased to 93%, 87%, and 46% of the control value, respectively, supporting that only virus-antibody bound particle can affect the current change. When the ratio further increased to 1:1 or 10:1, the current decreased to 30% of the control value on account of the higher number concentration of virus particles.\n\nDetection of H1N1 virus was carried out to check the universality of our proposed method. The H1N1 virus, antibody for H1N1, and virus\u2013antibody bound particles had modal diameters of 21.5 nm, 11 nm, and 31 nm, respectively, and the total number concentrations were 6.81 \u00d7 105 #/cm3, 6.58 \u00d7 105 #/cm3, and 5.83 \u00d7 105 #/cm3. The charge numbers for H1N1 virus, antibody for H1N1, and virus-antibody bound particles were 2.85, 1.44, and 4.31, respectively. Since the calculated deposition widths were 13.3 mm, 10.7 mm and 15.7 mm, respectively, for H1N1 virus, antibody for H1N1 virus, and virus-antibody bound particles, the swCNT-FET channel was located in the domain between 10.7 mm and 15.7 mm. Then particle deposition experiments were carried out and the change in source\u2013drain current was observed. Figure 8 shows 20% decrease in the current after the deposition of the virus\u2013antibody bound particles.\n\nThe reduced current in the swCNT-FET that was observed in the presence of virus\u2013antibody bound particle was most likely due to donation of electrons from negatively charged virus\u2013antibody bound particles (see Fig. S2 in \u201cSupplementary information\u201d). Because of the p-type characteristics of the swCNT, donation of electrons would reduce the number of holes (p-type charge carriers) in the swCNT, resulting in a decrease in the source\u2013drain current28.\n\nWe have fabricated swCNT-FETs with an OTS SAM coating, and demonstrated specific detection of aerosolized bacteriophage MS2 using anti-enterobacteriophage MS2 coat protein antibodies. Following deposition of the (negatively charged) virus\u2013antibody bound particles on the p-type swCNT-FET channel, the source\u2013drain current decreased to 30% of that measured with no particles deposition, which enabled detection of the presence of the target virus. Moreover, for the test of universality of our detection method, H1N1 virus was also detected and showed the source\u2013drain current decreased to 20% of that measured with no particles deposition.\n\nWe fabricated FETs using p-type single-walled CNTs swCNTs. A suspension of swCNTs was prepared by dispersing 5 mg of swCNTs (Hanwha, Korea) in 50 ml of 1,2-dichlorobenzene. To pattern the swCNT channel on a silicon dioxide wafer, an OTS self-assembled monolayer (SAM) technique was used. AZ5214 photoresist was patterned on the silicon oxide wafer using conventional photolithographic techniques. The wafer was then placed in a solution of OTS (1:500, v/v in hexane) for 5 min to form the OTS SAM on the wafer. The OTS-coated wafer was then dipped in acetone to remove the AZ5214 patterns, which resulted in an OTS-patterned wafer. The OTS-patterned wafer was then placed in the swCNT solution for 30 s, and rinsed using 1,2-dichlorobenzene. The swCNTs were then selectively absorbed onto the bare silicon dioxide regions, whereas the OTS SAM regions blocked the absorption of the swCNTs. Source and drain electrodes (Au/Pd, 30 nm/10 nm) were fabricated using conventional photolithography, thermal evaporation and lift-off. The source and drain electrodes were passivated using photoresist. Further details of swCNT-FETs can be found in Lee et al.29.\n\nBacteriophage MS2 (ATCC 15597-B1) and anti-enterobacteriophage MS2 coat protein antibody were used as the target virus and specific antibody. Bacteriophage MS2 is commonly used in aerosol experiments as a surrogate for human and animal viruses30. Bacteriophage MS2 is nonpathogenic, can be prepared in high concentrations, is ideal for detection in aerosol experiments, and responds to antimicrobial agents in a manner that is similar to human viruses31.\n\nEscherichia coli strain C3000 (ATTCC 15597) was selected as the host bacterium. To recover bacterial cells from a freeze-dried state, 10 ml of tryptic soy broth (TSB) were mixed with the freeze-dried bacterial cells. The mixture was incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C with agitation. A total of 0.1 ml of the incubated bacterial solution was injected into another 10 ml of TSB. The TSB solution containing the bacteria was then used as the host bacterial solution following incubation for 6 h at 37 \u00b0C with agitation.\n\nTSB (1 ml) was injected into the freeze-dried MS2 virus, and 0.1 ml of the viral solution was extracted. The extracted solution was mixed with 0.3 ml of the host bacterial solution and 29 ml of soft tryptic soy agar (TSA), containing 8 g/l agar. The resulting agar solution was poured into a Petri dish and incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C. The surface of the agar was removed using 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.0. The solution was centrifuged for 20 min at 5,000 g, and the supernatant was used as the virus solution in subsequent experiments. The virus solution was diluted using PBS to control the number concentration of the virus particles. Virus solutions with virus: antibody number concentrations of 0.01, 0.05, 0.1:1, 1:1, and 10:1 were prepared. Influenza A (H1N1) virus, strain A /Beijing/262/95 (8IN73-2, HyTest, Finland) was prepared for universality test. H1N1 virus solution was prepared with 10 ml of PBS and 120 \u03bcl of H1N1 virus stock,\n\nAnti-enterobacteriophage MS2 coat protein antibodies (ABE76, Millipore, Germany) and monoclonal mouse anti-influenza virus type A (3IN5, HyTest, Finland) were used. The MS2 coat protein of bacteriophage is an RNA-binding protein that assembles into a pentameric structure to form the phage shell. The MS2 coat protein binds to a stem-loop structure in the viral RNA and facilitates packaging of RNA molecules into viral capsids. In addition, it represses synthesis of the viral replicase enzyme. The MS2 coat protein is widely used as an experimental model for the study of RNA\u2013protein interactions that are involved in virus assembly. With the H1N1 antibodies, hybridoma clones were derived from hybridization of Sp2/0 myeloma cells with spleen cells form BALB/c mice immunized with purified influenza virus type A strain H1N1. Two antibody solutions were prepared: one from 10 ml of PBS and 120 \u03bcl of anti-enterobacteriophage MS2 coat protein stock, and the other from 2.5 ml of PBS and 195 \u03bcl of H1N1 antibody stock. The virus and antibody solutions were then mixed and incubated at room temperature for 10 min.\n\nDetails of the experimental setup are shown in Fig. S3 of the \u2018Supplementary Information.\u2019 After the mixed solution was prepared, the particles were aerosolized using the following procedure. Compressed air was passed through a clean air supply consisting of an oil trap, a diffusion dryer, and a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. The particle-free compressed air then entered a Collison-type atomizer (9302, TSI Inc., USA), containing the mixture. The aerosol flow rate was controlled using a rotameter. Dry, clean air flowed at 2 lpm, forming a high-velocity jet through an orifice in the atomizer. The pressure drop from this jet was used to draw the mixed solution up through a tube, which was then broken into droplets due to the high-velocity air jet. The resulting larger droplets impinged on an impactor, whereas the smaller droplets made no contact and formed an aerosol that exited through an outlet. The aerosolized mixed solution was passed through a diffusion dryer to remove water and a neutralizer (Soft X-ray charger 4530, HCT, Korea) to induce a Boltzmann charge distribution.\n\nThe neutralized particles entered a unipolar aerosol charger, with a stainless-steel needle (wire) electrode located at the center, which was used to generate a corona discharge at the sharp tip. The corona discharge generated air ions, which moved along the electric field to a grounded cylinder (made of duralumin). The charge per particle was controlled using a direct current (DC) voltage supplied from a high-voltage power supply. A bias of \u22128 kV was applied to the needle to charge the particles. Details of the charger are described in Park et al.32.\n\nThe charged particles (i.e., virus, antibody, virus-antibody) then entered a 30-cm-long cylindrical nozzle (6 mm in diameter), which was used to induce a fully developed flow to minimize the entrance effect at the nozzle (which had a Reynolds number of Re = 700). The nozzle filet had a radius of curvature of 2 mm at the tip to minimize the electric field33. After the charged particles were ejected from the nozzle, they were guided by an electric field and deposited on the substrate, which was located on an electrode that was biased at 7 kV. The separation between the nozzle and the substrate was 10 mm. The swCNT-FET was located where only the virus\u2013antibody bound particles were deposited (i.e., in Zone 2).\n\nThe virus\u2013antibody bound particles were deposited on the channel of the swCNT-FET, which led to a decrease in the source\u2013drain current in the swCNT-FET. To measure the current, the swCNT-FET was connected to a semiconductor parameter analyzer (4200, Keithley, USA). A back-gated biasing method was used; the gate bias was varied in the range \u22123 V to + 3 V, and a constant source\u2013drain bias of 100 mV was applied.\n\nAerosol sampling was carried out upstream of the nozzle. A scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) system was used to characterize the size distribution of the particles, which consisted of a differential mobility analyzer (DMA, 3081, TSI, USA) and a condensation particle counter (CPC, 3025, TSI, USA), which could measure the diameter in the range 4\u2013165 nm. The SMPS system was operated with a sample flow rate of 0.3 lpm and a scan time of 180 s.\n\nThe average particle charge was characterized by measuring the electric current resulting from the charged aerosol using an aerosol electrometer (3068A, TSI, USA), which consisted of a Faraday cup and an electrometer. Particles in the sample flow were collected in a high-efficiency conductive filter housed in a metal enclosure, which constituted the Faraday cup. Charged aerosols entered the instrument through an outer metal housing, which shielded the electrometer input from external electric fields. An absolute filter was used to remove the charged particles from the air stream, which was enclosed in an inner metal housing and electrically insulated from the outer metal housing. A signal feed connected the filter to the input of a solid-state electrometer amplifier. The electrometer had an analog output voltage range of 0\u201310 V, which corresponded to a maximum current of \u221212.5 to +12.5 pA. An ion trap was used to remove free unattached ions, and to enable charged particles to pass through the ion trap zone, where the ion trap voltage was 200 V34.\n\nThe average charge number of charged particles was calculated as follows:\n\n\n\nwhere I is the measured current, Q is the flow rate, and N is the total number concentration of charged particles.\n\nThe average charge number was also calculated using the following expression24:\n\n\n\nwhere vi,rms = 240 m/s is the mean thermal speed of gaseous air ions, KE = 9.0109 Nm2/C2 is the electrostatic constant of proportionality, kB is Boltzmann\u2019s constant, d is the mean particle diameter, T is temperature, and t = 0.0133 s is the particle residence time. The concentration of corona-generated air ions was determined as follows:\n\n\n\nwhere IC = 1.21 \u00d7 10\u22127 A is the corona current, Zi = 1.6 cm2/Vs is the mobility of the gaseous ions, and A = 9.84 \u00d7 10\u22127 m2 is the internal surface area of the ground electrode.\n\nHow to cite this article: Park, K.-T. et al.
