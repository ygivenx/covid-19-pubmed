Further stabilization of this hydrophobic interface arises from Leu4 and Ser5, Two structurally different dimers are observed in both of the two different crystal forms we have analyzed. In which form part of the N-terminal extended \u2424 chain, clipping onto the edge of the inner \u2424 sheet (strand 6) one of the dimers, the interface is principally formed by the parallel association of the C-terminal \u2423 helices from its dimer partner (see Figure 3A ). This interaction effectively forms two six-stranded \u2424 sheets that run ( Figures 1C and 3A) . This dimer has overall dimensions of 70 \u03eb 40 \u03eb 40 \u00c5 , and a total surface area of 1240 \u00c5 2 across the dimer interface, locking the dimer together. The N-terminal tag residues form an association with per monomer is buried upon dimer formation. This surface area drops to 990 \u00c5 2 on exclusion of the N-terminal the end of the C-terminal helix, which may account for a kink in the \u2423 helices, bending them away from the tag (AREAIMOL [CCP4, 1994] ). We would expect that in the absence of the N-terminal tag residues 1-3 at the dimer interface. This kinking, along with the extended \u2424-hairpin that forms a tower (residues 74-90), results in mature N terminus may be poorly ordered but the dimer interface is likely to remain extensive. The two helices a long groove that runs along the length of the dimer ( Figure 3A ). The base of this groove is rather hydropho-pack together at an angle of \u03ea28\u040a but unusually closely (the closest approach of the helix axes is 5.4 \u00c5 ). This bic in character, although the walls have some positive charged character.

The correlation\n\nThe second dimer observed in the crystals ( Figure 3B ) is formed by an interaction between \u2424 strand 5 (residues coefficient that measures surface complementarity (Sc [CCP4, 1994; Lawrence and Colman, 1993]) for this di-63-68) from both subunits zippering the two \u2424-barrels together ( Figure 2C ). The surface area buried on dimer mer interaction surface is 0.71 (0.76 excluding the N-terminal tag) and 0.77 for the helices alone, which formation is only 540 \u00c5 2 per monomer (the N-terminal tag does not participate in this interface), and the surface corresponds to a better shape matching than is observed in, for example, antibody-antigen interactions complementarity is 0.70. There is very little sequence conservation in residues involved in this dimer, but since (Lawrence and Colman, 1993). Analysis of the sequence conservation across known coronaviruses ( Figure 2C ) the interactions involved are primarily main chain atoms this is perhaps not surprising. Although the surface area reveals that the N and C termini of the protein are more conserved than the central core region, and the two key occluded on formation of the second type of dimer is less than for the first, this dimer type is strictly main-Dynamic Light Scattering tained in both crystal forms. In contrast, in the larger Analysis of dynamic light scattering data (see Expericell with four copies of the monomer in the asymmetric mental Procedures) indicates that for concentrations unit, although one ordered copy of the helix dimer is above 1.5mg ml \u03ea1 , nsp9 is monodisperse with a Stokes' present, in the second helix dimer one monomer is disorradius of approximately 2.1 nm ( Figure 4A ), which is in dered, reflecting fluidity in the packing of the monomer close agreement with the calculated radius of 1.9 nm along the helix axis.\n\nfor a dimer.

We therefore performed the same experiment using untagged mate-of the two. nsp9 shows two peaks, presumably corresponding to the monomeric and dimeric forms of the rial ( Figure 4B ). The measured values of M w were similar at all three speeds for the untagged material, which protein. nsp8 alone shows a polydisperse profile in line with its non-ideal behavior as observed earlier.
