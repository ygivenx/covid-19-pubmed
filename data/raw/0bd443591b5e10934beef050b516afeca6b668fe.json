{"title": "A simple model to assess Wuhan lock-down effect and region efforts during COVID-19 epidemic in China Mainland", "body": "December 1, 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China (Huang et al, 2020) , the overall confirmed cases in China had reached 78,959 by the end of February 27, 2020, and a total of 2,791 people had died of the disease.\n\nCOVID-19 had also spread to other 50 country with the confirmed cases and deaths were 4,696 and 67 respectively, by the end of February 27, 2020. The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 epidemic as an international public health emergency on January 30, 2020.\n\nTo prevent further dissemination of SARS-CoV-2, 31 Provinces in China Mainland had raised their public health response level to the highest state of emergency (level-1) by January 29, 2020. The Chinese government has implemented a series of large-scale public health interventions to control the epidemic, many of which have far exceeded what International Health Regulations required, especially Wuhan lock-down, nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement. Wuhan had prohibited all transport in and out of the city as of 10:00 on January 23, 2020, this is maybe the largest quarantine/movement restriction in human history to prevent infectious disease spread (Tian et al, 2020) . Hundreds of millions Chinese residents, including 9 million Wuhan residents, have to reduce even stop their inter-city travel and intra-city activities due to these strict measures.\n\nDue to Wuhan lock-down, Kucharski et al (2020) estimated that the median daily reproduction number had declined from 2.35 of January 16 to 1.05 of January 30, Tian et al. (2020) estimated that the dispersal of infection to other cities was deferred 2.91 days (CI: 2.54-3.29). However, Read et al (2020) suggested that travel restrictions from and to Wuhan city are unlikely to be effective in halting transmission across China; with a 99% effective reduction in travel, the size of the epidemic outside of Wuhan may only be reduced by 24.9% on February 4. Do these large-scale public health interventions really work well in China? Besides, hundreds of officials were fired or appointed rapidly according to their incompetent or outstanding performances during the epidemic. How to assess the efforts of different regions in China Mainland against COVID-19?\n\nHere we present a simple yet effective model based on Baidu Migration data and the confirmed cases data to quantify the consequences and importance of Wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement on the ongoing spread of COVID-19 across China Mainland, and preliminarily assess the efforts of 29 Provinces and 44 prefecture-level cities during the epidemic.\n\n.

The travelers were down 91.61% and 91.62%, compared to the same period last year (14 million) and the first 23d (14 million from January 1 to January 23, 2020), respectively (Fig.1) .

It was down 42.42% and 50.27% when compared to the same period last year (4.53/d) and the first 23d (5.25/d), respectively (Fig.3) .\n\nObviously, COVID-19 greatly reduced the human mobility of China Mainland.\n\nWe consider 44 regions in China Mainland which accept travelers from Wuhan, including 29 Provinces (Tibet was excluded since only one confirmed case was reported) and 15 prefecture-level cities in Hubei province. We noticed that the number of confirmed cases between non-Hubei and Hubei were closer in the early period. For example, the number of cumulative confirmed cases by the end of January 26 in Chongqing (non-Hubei) and\n\nXiaogan (Hubei) were 110 and 100, respectively. Their cumulative confirmed cases by the end of February 27, however, were 576 and 3,517, respectively. We surmise that this is partly because Xiaogan has received more infected cases from Wuhan than Chongqing since the human-to-human transmission risk of COVID-19 was confirmed and announced on January 20. This surmise was confirmed by Fig.4 . The proportion of travelers from Wuhan accepted by Hubei regions to the total travelers from Wuhan increased rapidly from 70% (before January 19) to 74% (January 20), even over 77% after January 26. So we concluded that the first key factor affecting the later (e.g. February 27) cumulative confirmed cases of each non-Wuhan region is the sum immigrants from Wuhan during January 20 to January 26 (few immigrants after January 27). These immigrants had higher infected probability but lower transmission .

According to the recent report, there is a mean 10-day delay between infection and detection, comprising a mean about 5 day incubation period and a mean 5 day delay from symptom onset to detection of a case (Imai et al, 2020; Yang et al, 2020; Li et al, 2020) . So the second key factor can be represented with the number of cumulative confirmed cases by the end of January 29. These \"seed cases\" had higher transmission ability because the susceptible had no any protection measure. A simple regression model was established as follow.\n\ny= 70.0916+0.0054\u00d7x1+2.3455\u00d7x2 (n = 44, R 2 = 0.9330, P<10 -7 )\n\nHere, y is the number of cumulative confirmed cases by February 27 of each non-Wuhan region, x1 is the sum number of immigrants from Wuhan during January 20 to January 26 of each non-Wuhan region, and x2 is the number of cumulative confirmed cases by January 29 of each non-Wuhan region.\n\nThe standard regression coefficients of x1 and x2 are 0.6620 and 0.3796 respectively, indicating that x1 is more important than x2 for determining y.

Then we assumed three different lock-down plans besides the real plan (Table 1) . I20  I21  I22  I22  I22  I22  I23  I24  I25  I26 Strict * : none left Wuhan since the date of lock-down. I20 ~ I29 are the real emigrants from January 20 to January 29, respectively.\n\nIt's not fair to assess the effort of different regions only based on the final number of cumulative confirmed cases due to the difference of the number of immigrants from Wuhan. The aforementioned interpretative model has taken this difference into account and the results are listed with 5 grade (Excellent, Good, Normal, Poor, Very poor) according to standard residuals (Table 2 and Table 3 ). We emphasize that this is only a preliminary evaluation and the results are for reference only.\n\nThe human mobility data on inter-city travel and intra-city activity from January 1, 2020 to February 21, 2020 (including the same period data in 2019) in China Mainland is from Baidu Migration (http://qianxi.baidu.com).\n\nThe inter-city travel population of each city is represented with immigration and emigration index, the travelers proportions of different destination and departure, on the level of Province and city (but only the top 100 cities), are also listed. The intra-city activity intensity of each city is represented with the index (not proportion) of .

We estimate one Baidu Migration index is about equal to 56,137 travelers (Fig.6) .\n\nThe confirmed case data on each Province and prefecture-level city are from the National Health Commission of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/yqtb/list_gzbd.shtml) and its affiliates.\n\nBaidu Migration recorded more types of spatial displacement, including airplane, high-speed rail, ship, coach and private car, so it theoretically has higher accuracy. The real inter-city travel population of each city, however, is to the last day before lock-down (January 22) is 95.98, then the two model estimated travelers are 2.9 million and 5.4 million, respectively. News Release Conference of Wuhan on 26 January confirmed that more than 5 million people had left Wuhan after 10 January due to the Spring Festival travel rush and epidemic. Our estimated value is closer to official reports.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Baidu Migration index still has the following disadvantages for estimating real traveler population. 1) The mobility behavior of a large number of groups un-connected to Baidu Map and third-party .

For example, one user travel from A, pass through B and arrive final destination C, and the user also has location information in C by coincidence, then this trip will be disassembled into A-B and B-C. Regardless, big data has and will continue to play an important role in public health. There are 9.48 million residents in Wuhan around January 26, the cumulative confirmed cases are 2,261 by January 29. We estimate at least 56,916 people were infected in Wuhan according to our model (up to February 27 the confirmed cases are 48,137). In other words, more than 8,000 undetected but infected individuals still wait for checking out in the center of epidemic storm. Wuhan still has much to do.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 has diversity transmission approaches, including respiratory (mouth foam) and contact routes which have been confirmed, as well as aerosol and digestive (fecal-oral) routes which cannot be ruled out (National Health Commission of China, 2020). It is also highly concealed according to the recent report of transmission of the virus from asymptomatic and mild individuals (Zhang et al, 2020; Sanche et al, 2020 Yang et al (2020) , respectively. At the beginning of the outbreak, the infected individuals may be greatly underestimated due to the asymptomatic transmissions, insufficient sensitivity of diagnostic reagents and delayed .

The latest estimated value of R0 and the control reproductive number is 4.7-6.6 (Steven et al, 2020) and 6.47 (CI: 5.71-7.23) (Tang et al, 2020), respectively. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious, Wang et al (2020) projected that without any control measure the infected population would exceed 200,000 in Wuhan by the end of February. As for Steven et al (2020) and Read et al (2020) , the estimated number was 233,400 (CI: 38,757-778,278) by the end of January and 191, 529 (CI: 132, 649) by February 4, respectively. Up to February 27, the confirmed cases are 48,137.\n\nThe only lesson that humans have learned from history is that humans have not learned anything from history.\n\nClearly, Wuhan has not learned anything from the SARS epidemic in 2003, now she is suffering from her early delays. Fortunately, China Government has implemented a series of large-scale public health interventions to control the epidemic. In fact, many prevention and control measures taken by China, especially Wuhan lock-down, nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement, go far beyond the requirements for responding to emergencies, setting new benchmarks for epidemic prevention in other countries. The Chinese method has proven to be successful. The strategy adopted by China has changed the fast-rising curve of newly diagnosed cases, and the simplest and most direct thing that can explain this is the data (Fig.7) .\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is still rapidly growing and spread to more than 42 countries as of February 27, 2020.\n\nAt present, the most serious countries outside China are South Korea, Italy, Iran, and Japan. It is worrying that although some measures have been taken, the current prevention and control measures of these countries may still be insufficient. None of them has reached the level of prevention and control in China's moderately affecting .
