{"title": "Catalytic site studies on tuna( Thunnus albacares) aminopeptidase", "body": "Aminopeptidases (APs) are hydrolases which split off the N-terminal amino acid residues from peptides and proteins. These enzymes are widely distributed in vertebrate, invertebrate and plant tissues, and in microorganisms. Many functions of APs have been suggested. They participate in the breakdown of petides in the gut, and maturation of hormones. They have been associated with some pathological conditions [1] . Aminopeptidase N (EC 3.4.11.2) has been shown to be involved in Na+-dependent amino acid transport [2] . It is involved in human cy-tomegalovirus infection [3] , and it is also a specific receptor for human coronavirus 229E [4] , and the enterophathogenic coronavirus TGEV [5] . It has been suggested that aminopeptidases regulate, via amino terminal processing, the susceptibility of some proteins to degradation by ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system [6] .\n\nMany APs have been purified and characterized. They are classified with respect to certain physical and biochemical properties such as metal ion content, kinetic characteristics including specificity and relative efficiency with which amino acid residues are removed, and susceptibility to inhibition by bestatin, amastatin, and puromycin [7] [8] [9] . They can be distinguished by the location of the enzyme which can be cytosolic, membraneous or a secreted form. Specificity of APs are broad and it has been suggested that an aminopeptidase should be assayed with a range of peptide substrates before choosing a name [10] .\n\nAmastatin is one of the potent inhibitors of aminopeptidases. It behaves as a competitive slow and tight-binding inhibitor [11] . Its complexation with bovine lens leucine aminopeptidase (blLAP) has been recently used to eluci-date the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme [12] . It is also a good tool for titration of aminopeptidases to determine the number of active sites [ 11 ] .\n\nIn a previous published study, we reported several physical, chemical and kinetic properties of an aminopeptidase purified from tuna (Thunnus albacares) pyloric caeca [13] . The enzyme appears to be distinct from leucine aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.1) and AP M (EC 3.4.11.2). In our attempt to identify tAP we decided to investigate the composition of the catalytic site of this enzyme. In this paper we report some additional properties of tuna aminopeptidase (tAP) relating to its inhibition by amastatin and to the identification of some essential amino acid residues of the catalytic site.\n\nLeucine-p-nitroanilide, glycine-p-nitroanilide, amastatin, phenylglyoxal, N-ethoxycarbonyl-3-(2-morpholiethyl)-l-2-dihydroquinone, tetranitromethane, and 1cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide-metho-ptoluene sulfonate were obtained from Sigma (USA). IDA-Sepharose 6B and Sephadex G-25 were obtained from Pharmacia (Sweden). Reagents for electrophoresis were obtained from Serva (Germany). All common reagents were from Prolabo (France).\n\nAminopeptidase activity against LPNA or GPNA was determined spectrophotometrically as described previously.\n\nEnzyme samples (50 /~1) were diluted with 150 /zl of 50 mM Mes buffer (pH 6.0) containing 0.1 M CMC or 5 mM EEDQ. Some samples were treated with amastatin (0.2 mM final concentration) for 30 min at 35\u00b0C and some reaction mixtures contained 1 mM glycine methyl ester. After incubation at 35\u00b0C for the time periods indicated in the text, aminopeptidase activity was measured and plotted as percent of the control which corresponds to the enzyme incubated in the same conditions but in the absence of the modifying reagent.\n\nReactivation of CMC-treated tAP was assayed by addition of 1 M hydroxylamine after incubation of the enzyme with the modifying reagent for 5 h at 35\u00b0C. The reaction mixture containing hydroxylamine (0.5 M final concentration) was incubated for an additional hour at the same temperature.\n\nApo-tAP was prepared by incubating the enzyme in the presence of 10 mM EDTA for 3 h at 35\u00b0C. Then, EDTAtreated tAP and untreated enzyme were chromatographed on small columns of Sephadex G-25 (1 ml) previously equilibrated with 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) which was used for protein elution. 10 /zl of 25 mM DEPC were added to 1 ml of each enzyme preparation in the same buffer and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Then, DEPC-treated tAP activity was directly measured, whereas DEPC-treated apo-tAP preparations were subjected to a chromatography step on an IDA(Co 2\u00f7 )-Sepharose 6B column (0.5 ml) prior to the measurement of the activity. All enzyme samples were used in duplicate and the experiment was independently repeated twice.\n\nThe amount of protein was determined by the method of Bradford [14] using bovine serum albumin as the standard.\n\nFor the experiments involving chemical modifications of APs, free amastatin and or excess of the modifying agent were removed by gel filtration using small columns (1.5 ml) of Sephadex G-25. The reaction mixture of amastatin and AP or amastatin, AP, and or modifying agent in 50 to 100 ~1 of total volume was chromatographed on a Sephadex column and fractions of 100 /xl were collected.\n\nTuna AP (0.4 nM) was titrated with 0, 0.24, 0.4, 0.64, and 0.8 nM amastatin and the activity was plotted as percentage activity vs. equivalent of aminopeptidase [11] .\n\nIn order to avoid significant substrate depletion that could interfere with inhibition development [ 15, 16] , GPNA, which has a lower kca t and higher K m compared to LPNA, was used as substrate. Two approaches were used to examine the inhibition of tAP by amastatin. (1) Enzyme was added to a solution containing GPNA and amastatin.\n\n(2) The hydrolysis reaction of GPNA was initiated by addition of a mixture of tAP and amastatin, previously incubated for 30 min at 35\u00b0C, to a solution of substrate. The former showed a slow development of tAP inhibition while the later indicated that this inhibition was reversible ( Fig. 1) . Total activity of amastatin-treated tAP could be restored after diluting 1000-fold in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and incubation for 2 h at room temperature ( Fig. 2 ). We took advantage of this property and used amastatin as a protective agent of tAP active sites in the enzyme chemical modification experiments. Furthermore, titration of tAP active sites with amastatin was achieved. The results revealed the binding of two molar equivalents of amastatin to the enzyme (Fig. 3 ).\n\nCarbodiimide reagents are used for determination of carboxyl groups in protein and have been used for specific modification of acidic amino acids in enzymes [17] . EEDQ also react with carboxyl groups. This reaction leads to the formation of mixed anhydride. It has been used as a condensation agent in ligand immobilization on solid support [18] .\n\nMore than 80% of tAP activity was lost after incubation of the enzyme in the presence of CMC. As shown in Fig.  4 . strong inactivation of tAP (more than 80%) was observed after incubation of the enzyme with CMC for 2 h at 35\u00b0C. This inactivation is irreversible and tAP activity could not be restored by incubation with 0.5 M hydroxylamine. The presence of glycine methyl ester as a nucleophile did not influence the rate of inactivation by CMC. These results indicate that the inactivation is probably caused by the modification of a carboxyl group.\n\nPreincubation of tAP with amastatin decreased the inactivation effect of CMC. Only 20% of the enzyme activity was lost after incubation for 5 h at 35\u00b0C with the modifying reagent. Treatment of tAP with EEDQ resulted in a strong inactivation of the enzyme. More than 90% of tAP activity was lost after incubation for 1 h with EEDQ. A protective effect of the enzyme with amastatin was also observed. Amastatin-treated tAP lost 64% of activity after incubation for I h at 35\u00b0C with this modifying reagent (Fig. 5) .\n\nPhenylglyoxal is a chemical modifying reagent which reacts specifically with arginine residue at alkaline pH values [19] . Treatment of tAP with phenylglyoxal resulted in a decrease in the enzyme activity. As shown in Fig. 6 , the inhibition of tAP is time dependent. Modification of arginine residues by phenylglyoxal is reversible at pH 8.0. Phenylglyoxal-treated tAP activity can be restored after dilution in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and incubation for 2 h at room temperature (Table 1) . Partial reactivation of the inhibited enzyme was obtained after dilution with 0.65 M ammonium acetate whereas very low reactivation occurred at pH 6. Since the modified arginine residue is stable at this pH, we used 50 mM Mes buffer (pH 6) to elute amastatin-treated tAP from Sephadex G-25 column, and then the complex tAP-amastatin was diluted in the same buffer to permit its dissociation. Amastatin-treated tAP is not affected by phenylglyoxal treatment since the remaining activity was more than 95%. All these results indicate the presence of an essential arginine residue probably located at the active site of tAP.\n\nTNM is a suitable mild reagent for the nitration of tyrosyl residues at pH 8 [20] . The effect of this modifying reagent on tAP activity was examined. Treatment of the enzyme with 50 mM TNM resulted in the inactivation of the aminopeptidase. The enzyme is inactivated in a timedependent manner (Fig. 7) . When tAP was preincubated with amastatin, less than 20% of the enzyme activity was lost after incubation with TNM for 6 h at 20\u00b0C. These results reveal the presence of an essential tyrosine residue in tAP.\n\nDEPC is an acylation agent which can react with histidine at pH 6.0. This reaction usually leads to the formation of carboethoxyhistidine [21] .\n\nIncubation of DEPC with tAP at pH 6.0 did not affect the enzyme activity (results not shown). Incubation of zinc-depleted tAP with DEPC also had no effect on the enzyme activity. Indeed, full activity of apo-tAP pretreated with the modifying agent was restored by Co 2+ using an IDA (Co 2+)-Sepharose 6B column.\n\nTuna aminopeptidase is reversibly inhibited by amastatin which acts as a competitive slow and tight-binding inhibitor of many aminopeptidases such as bovine lens leucine aminopeptidase, aminopeptidase M and Aeromonas aminopeptidase [11, 22] . The slow formation of tAPamastatin complexes can be demonstrated and dissociation of these complexes was also shown to be slow suggesting a tight binding behaviour. This property allows amastatin to be used as a catalytic site titrant; tAP binds two molar equivalents of the inhibitor. Because amastatin has been assumed to be a transition-state analogue, only catalytically active enzyme is expected to bind the inhibitor with high affinity. The result obtained in this study suggests the presence of one catalytic site per tAP subunit. This is consistent with the presence of one zinc-atom per tAP subunit [13] . However, the possibility that species other than catalytically active tAP might bind the inhibitor cannot be ruled out. Bestatin, another transition-state analogue, was used for titration of catalytic site of blLAP [23] . The enzyme binds six equivalents of the inhibitor per hexamer. This result is in agreement with X-ray crystallographic studies [24, 25] . As for AP-A tAP is not inhibited by bestatin. This characteristic distinguishes markedly tAP from LAP.\n\nChemical modification of tAP with some modifying reagents allowed us to identify some amino acid residues essential for the enzyme activity.\n\nCMC reversibly inhibits the enzyme in a time-dependent way. More marked inhibition of tAP was obtained with EEDQ. Treatment of tAP with amastatin prior to addition of one of these modifiers results in a protective effect on the enzyme.\n\nThe reaction of carboxyl groups with carbodiimide reagents leads to the formation of an intermediate Oacylisourea, and the product is stabilized by addition of a nucleophile [17] . Addition of glycine methyl ester as a nucleophile did not affect the rate of tAP inactivation by CMC. This has been already observed for some other enzymes [26, 27] .\n\nSince carbodiimide reagents can react with tyrosine residues, treatment of CMC-treated tAP with 0.5 M hydroxylamine was carried out. The failure of hydroxylamine to reactivate the enzyme suggests that inactivation of tAP is mainly caused by the modification of carboxyl groups located at the active site. Actually CMC should have reacted with tyrosine residues present in the active site (see below). The absence of any partial reactivation by hydroxylamine suggests that all functional carboxyl groups were modified by CMC. These results reveal the presence of essential carboxyl groups in tAP catalytic site. Similar studies have been reported for Aeromonas aminopeptidase [28] , angiotensin converting enzyme [27] , Clostridium histolyticum collagenase [29] , and human neutrophil collagenase [30] . Our results are consistent with the presence of His-Glu-Xaa-Xaa-His consensus sequence in most zinccontaining metallopeptidases [26] . In addition, Glu and both Asp and Glu are involved in zinc binding in AP-M and LAP, respectively [31] .\n\nTreatment of tAP with TNM led to inactivation of the enzyme. Amastatin-treated tAP is not affected by this modifying reagent. TNM reacts with tyrosine residues and can also oxidate SH groups [20] . Since tAP contains no essential cysteine residues [13] our results indicate the presence of a tyrosine residue essential for the activity of tAP. The protective effect of amastatin suggests that the nitrated tyrosine is part of the active site. No tyrosine residue has been shown to be present in LAP catalytic site [12,24,251. The active sites of metalloproteinases usually contain glutamic acid, tyrosine, and basic amino acids essential for their activity [26, 32] .\n\nChemical modification of tAP with phenylglyoxal, a mild and specific modifier of arginine, results in a marked decrease of the enzyme activity. Pretreatment of tAP with amastatin prior to addition of the modifying reagent led to a significant decrease of the inhibition rate. These results reveal the presence of an arginine residue located at tAP catalytic site.\n\nX-ray crystallographic studies of blLAP revealed the presence of an arginine residue (Arg-336) at the active site [24, 25] . Kim and Lipscomb [12] have recently proposed a catalytic mechanism for the same enzyme based on X-ray crystallographic studies of blLAP complex with amastatin. The mechanism invokes a role for Arg-336 as an electrophilic substrate activator and transition state stabilizer. This amino acid residue seems to be conserved in other aminopeptidases and in carboxypeptidase A [33] . The presence of a catalytically important arginine residue in thyrotropin-releasing-hormone-degrading ectoenzyme was demonstrated by O'Connor and O'Cuinn [34] .\n\nThe failure of diethylpyrocarbonate to affect both native tAP and zinc-depleted enzyme indicates that histidine residues are neither involved in the zinc-ligand formation nor in the catalysis mechanism. These results are in agreement with those obtained for Aeromonas aminopeptidase [28, 35] .\n\nAs APs include a number of apparently distinct hydrolases, utilisation of various criteria for their classification is required. Otherwise nonexclusive names may be concluded [10] . For this purpose, investigation of the active site composition is an asset."}
