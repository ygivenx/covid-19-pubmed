{"title": "SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Spike-RBD Structure and Receptor Binding Comparison and Potential Implications on Neutralizing Antibody and Vaccine Development", "body": "In December 2019, outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection has brought back the attention of pathogenic coronavirus to the spotlight [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . SARS-CoV-2 is spreading rapidly, causing severe COVID-19 symptoms and life-threatening diseases in some infected patients 6 . Numbers of infected cases reached over 60,000 in less than 3 months 7 .\n\nThe prominent sequence differences between the crucial RBMs of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV raise a critical question of whether the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to human ACE2 is comparable to that of SARS-CoV. A recent study by computational modeling suggested that SARS-CoV-2 has a lower binding affinity to human ACE2, as a result of the loss of one hydrogen bond interactions 18 . However, another publication using structure analysis suggested similar binding affinities to SARS-CoV 9 . By using biolayer interferometry binding assay, Tian et al. 9 measured the SARS-CoV-2 RBD's binding affinity to human ACE2 protein to be 15.2 nM, which is comparable to previously published affinity data for SARS-CoV spike protein 19 . The above comparison of spike proteins' binding affinities to human ACE2 between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV were inconclusive or indirect, hence, a direct head-to-head comparison is desired for the understanding of the infectivity and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nNeutralizing antibody (nAb) is expected to be one of the most promising treatments against coronavirus infection among the existing therapeutic options 20, 21 . Several nAbs targeting SARS-CoV exhibit significant in vivo antivirus activities by reducing virus titers in lung tissues of animal models [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . However, coronavirus is a single-stranded RNA virus prone to rapid mutations during transmission, nAbs without cross-reactivity to a broad spectrum of viral mutants could lead to treatment failure 10, [27] [28] [29] , therefore, highly potent and cross-protective nAbs and prophylactic vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are in urgent needs.\n\nwith ACE2 by computational modeling and binding free energy analysis. We also used the recombinant S1 proteins of the two viruses to compare their binding curves to both recombinant ACE2 protein and ACE2 expressing cells. The above studies confirm that both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have similar binding affinities to the human receptor ACE2.\n\nDue to the relatively low homology of the spike RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, it is of significant interest to investigate whether SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies possess cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV polyclonal antibodies and ACE2 blocking and non-blocking nAbs were tested with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (PSV) for cross neutralizing activities.\n\nThe structure model for SARS-CoVRBD-ACE2 complex was optimized based on the complex's crystal structure (PDB ID: 2AJF) (http://www.rcsb.org/). The structure model for SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 complex was constructed by homology modeling using the optimized SARS-CoV RBD-ACE2 complex crystal structure as a template, based on a 73.7% amino acid sequence homology between the two viruses. Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of C\u03b1 atoms between the two complex structures is 0.703 \u00c5, indicating an almost identical structural conformation (Figure1B). There are subtle differences in the RBD-ACE2 interfaces between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV at the loop 469-470 (numbered according to SARS-CoV RBD), arising from a one-residue insertion after residue 469 ( Figure 1A) .\n\nOn the other hand, the interaction patterns in both complex structures' interfaces are somewhat different ( Figure 1A and Table S2 ). Four residues in SARS-CoV-2 RBD (i.e. N439, G476, Q498, and N501) lost their interactions with ACE2 as compared with the corresponding residues in SARS-CoV RBD (i.e. R426, D463, Y484, and T487), four replacing residues in SARS-CoV-2 RBD (i.e. K417, V445, E484, and F486) form new interactions with ACE2, which are absent in the SARS-CoV RBD (corresponding to V404, S432, P470, and L472) ( Figure 1A&C ). It is noteworthy that although a strong salt-bridge presented between R426 of SARS-CoV RBD and E329 of ACE2, is missing in the interaction involving SARS-CoV-2 RBD. However, a new strong salt-bridge interaction between E484 of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and K31 of ACE2 compensates for that loss.\n\nThe RBD-ACE2 binding free energies of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are estimated to be -40.42 and -44.96 REU (Rosetta energy unit), respectively (Table S1), by Rosetta Interface Analyzer 30 . The insignificant difference in binding free energies suggests that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV viruses have similar binding affinities to human ACE2. author/funder. All rights reserved.

Binding curves of recombinant S1 proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV to human ACE2 were measured by ELISA. Results confirmed that both viruses have similar S1-ACE2 protein-protein binding curves and EC 50 (Figure 2A) . Binding curves of S1 protein to ACE2 expressing 293T cells was further assessed using FACS. Again, similar binding curves and EC 50 values were obtained for the two viruses ( Figure 2B ). The above experimental results are consistent with our structure modeling analysis, which indicates that SARS-CoV-2 virus likely infects human cells through similar mechanisms as SARS-CoV virus by binding to human ACE2 with comparable affinities, and hence may possess similar transmissibility.\n\nA.

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are two different coronaviruses with modest level of sequence homology in their spike proteins. Understanding whether antibodies raised from SARS-CoV spike protein immunization have cross-reactivity to the new SARS-CoV-2 will offer important insights and guidance to therapeutic antibody and prophylactic vaccine development.\n\nSARS-CoV nAbs were generated by immunizing mouse or rabbit with SARS-CoV S1 or RBD protein. Two SARS-CoV S-protein rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Table 1 ) and four monoclonal antibodies ( Table 2 ) were analyzed for cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein and cross-neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV-2 PSV. As expected, the polyclonal antibodies showed weaker binding to SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein (EC 50 >100ng/mL) as compared to SARS-CoV S1 protein (EC 50 <25ng/mL). Neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 PSV were lower by more than two-orders of magnitudes than SARS-CoV PSV (Table 1) , presenting a pessimistic forecast for the probability to identify highly potent and cross-reactive nAbs to SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV antibodies or antibody libraries.\n\nSARS-CoV monoclonal nAbs with strong S1 binding (EC 50 <50ng/mL, K D \u22642.0E-10 M) and potent ACE2-blocking activities exhibited potent neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV (minimum dose to reach 100% neutralization at ~0.1\u03bcg/mL), but almost no cross-binding to SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein (EC 50 >15\u03bcg/mL) and no cross-neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 PSV (<50% neutralizing activity at 100\u03bcg/mL) (Figure3, Table 2, Figure S1 & S2).\n\nInterestingly, three ACE2-non-blocking monoclonal antibodies showed modest binding activities to SARS-CoV S1 protein (EC 50 >100ng/mL) and neutralizing activities to the SARS-CoV PSV (minimum dose to reach 100% neutralization at \u2265 10 \u03bcg/mL). Although, these nAbs were less potent than the ACE2-blocking nAbs to SARS-CoV, but could evidently cross-bind to the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein (EC 50 <3\u03bcg/mL) and cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 PSV (>50% neutralizing activity at 100\u03bcg/mL) ( Table 2) .

Binding of SARS nAbs to SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein were tested by ELSIA. Recombinant S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 were coated on plates, serial diluted nAbs were added for binding to recombinant S1 protein. C. Neutralization of SARS-CoV nAbs against SARS-CoV-2 PSV. D. Antibody competition with SARS-CoV RBD binding to ACE2. Recombinant SARS-CoV RBD protein was coated on plates, nAbs and recombinant ACE2 were then added for RBD binding competition measurements. \n\nAs suggested by the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBD sequence alignment analysis (Figure 1A) , the 50% RBM sequence homology is much less than the 73.7% RBD sequence homology. Structure similarity analysis confirms the presence of significant local structure differences in the RBM regions, while the rest of the RBD regions have significantly higher similarities (Figure 4) . Moreover, three glycosylation sites in SARS-CoV RBD (i.e. N318, N330, and N357) 32 was conserved, although one of the glycosylation sites, N357, may not be glycosylated in the corresponding residue of SARS-CoV-2 as predicted by NetNGlyc 33 .\n\nTaking the two viruses' RBD structure similarities and glycosylation sites into account, we predict that there are two possible conserved regions in RBD where epitopes for cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies reside. These regions probably do not overlap with the ACE2 binding sites (Figure 4) . We speculate that it is more likely to obtain cross-reactive and non-blocking neutralizing antibodies targeting the conserved regions outside the RBM region. The neutralization mechanism for these non-blocking but cross-reactive antibodies is likely unrelated to ACE2 blockage.\n\nRBD is shown in a space-filled model with colored surface. ACE2 is shown as gray tube model. The three glycosylation sites in SARS-CoV are labeled. Note that N 357 ST in SARS-CoV is changed to N 370 SA in SARS-CoV-2, which is different from the NXS/T pattern required for glycosylation, and hence this site is more likely to be unglycosylated. The two possible cross-reactive regions are marked with yellow circles.\n\nCoronavirus spike protein has been shown to be responsible for interacting with host author/funder. All rights reserved.

Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV viruses use human ACE2 for cell entry 10 . Due to the nature of RNA virus' rapid mutation rates, changes in the S-protein's amino acid sequence, especially in the RBD's receptor binding motif, could have significant impact on virus infectivity, pathogenicity, transmissibility, and cross-protection from previous coronavirus infection, as well as therapeutic antibody and prophylactic vaccine development. Hence, understanding the differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and their implications may offer significant scientific and practical value.\n\nThough it is difficult to assess the virus-host-cell interactions with real virion, we studied the new SARS-CoV-2 in head-to-head comparisons with SARS-CoV using multiple methods. Measurements of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike proteins to recombinant ACE2 protein and ACE2 expressing 293T cells confirmed the two coronaviruses' similar binding affinities to human ACE2 (Figure 2A&B) , which provided direct molecular based evidences to support and possibly explain the observation that the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has similar transmissibility to SARS-CoV virus.\n\nSince SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are both coronaviruses with over 70% sequence homology and share the same human receptor ACE2, analyzing SARS-CoV's antibodies' cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 may provide useful information on whether neutralizing epitopes were conserved on the two coronaviruses. Two rabbit polyclonal antibodies produced with SARS-CoV S1 and RBD proteins had potent binding and neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV but only modest cross-binding and cross-neutralizing activities to the new SARS-CoV-2 virus. Four highly potent ACE2 blocking SARS-CoV monoclonal antibodies showed binding affinities to SARS-CoV S1 protein in the range of 0.2 nM to 8.7 pM, and very high neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV. As low as 0.2 ug/mL nAb can lead to 100% neutralization of SARS-CoV PSV. However, virtually no cross-binding or cross neutralizing activities against the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus were detected with the four ACE2 blocking monoclonal antibodies.\n\nWe then screened non-ACE2-blocking antibodies raised from SARS-CoV RBD for neutralizing activities. Three such monoclonal antibodies were identified. Although, binding affinities to SARS-CoV S1 protein was significantly lower with EC 50 between 55 to 224 \u03bcg/mL as compared to 16 to 42 \u03bcg/mL EC 50 for the four ACE2-blocking nAbs, significant cross-binding activities to SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein and modest cross-neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 PSV were detected.\n\nThe observation that these three antibodies bind to and neutralize both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 without blocking ACE2 suggest the following. First, the epitope or epitopes for these three antibodies are conserved across the two significantly different coronaviruses. Hence it is possible but maybe challenging to identify antibodies with potent neutralizing activities to both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and ideally to their mutant virus strains as well. Second, the epitope or epitopes for the three nAbs author/funder. All rights reserved.

We analyzed 68 sequences of SARS-CoV-2 variants in GISAID and found 4 variants with mutations in RBD (one has N354D/D364Y, two have V367F, and one has F342L). Alignment of 111 SARS-CoV RBD sequences, collected by BLAST via NCBI website 34 , was used for ConSurf analysis 35 . As shown in Figure 5 , the SARS-CoV RBM region is highly variable, making it more challenging to develop cross-reactive antibodies with broad spectrum of neutralizing activities against mutant strains. On the other hand, significant portions of RBD (marked in pink) outside the RBM motif are highly conserved. Neutralizing antibodies targeting epitopes in these regions could potentially have cross-protective activities against different mutant strains.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that the three non-blocking antibodies' neutralizing activities are significantly lower than the four blocking antibodies. Due to the limited number of antibodies obtained, it is difficult to conclude whether there is a consistent pattern between ACE2 blockage and neutralizing potency, but one can speculate that neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved epitopes outside the RBM region may be cross-protective but may also be less potent due to the lack of ACE2 blocking activities. In a recent article 9 , a SARS-CoV RBD neutralizing antibody CR3022 with an epitope outside the RBM motif was also shown to be non-blocking but cross-binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with a relatively low K D of 6.3 nM.\n\nThe neutralization mechanism of these non-blocking antibodies is not clear yet. It is known that antibodies targeting the S2 region could block S2 protein's configuration change and hence interfere with virus entry into host cells. Whether these non-blocking RBD antibodies also interfere with S2 protein's configuration change remains to be investigated.\n\nIn summary, the above findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bind to human ACE2 with similar affinities and hence may have similar transmissibility. Antibodies targeting the RBM regions may be more potent due to their ACE2 blocking activities but cross-protecting antibodies targeting the RBM regions may be more difficult to obtain because of the lower degree of sequence conservation. Antibodies to the more conserved regions outside the RBM motif may possess cross-protective neutralizing activities but may be less potent due to the lack of ACE2 blocking activities. Mechanism of neutralization for the non-blocking RBD antibodies remains to be investigated. Developing potent and cross-protective therapeutic antibodies and vaccines is possible but could be challenging. author/funder. All rights reserved.
