{"title": "Title: A novel antiviral formulation inhibits a range of enveloped viruses", "body": "The antimicrobial properties of fatty acids have been extensively reported in the literature (for review, see Thormar et al. (Thormar and Hilmarsson, 2007) and (Churchward et al., 2018) . Previously, (Thormar et al., 1987) demonstrated the antiviral effects of 14 different free fatty acids and lipid extracts from human milk against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), herpes simplex virus (HSV) and visna virus revealed that short chain saturated fatty acids (butyric, caproic and caprylic) together with long chain saturated fatty acids (palmitic and stearic) had no or very little antiviral activity, whereas medium chain saturated entities including capric, lauric, myristic and long chain unsaturated oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids were anti-viral, albeit at different concentrations. Another study (Hilmarsson et al., 2005) reported similar trends in the antiviral activity of six medium chain fatty acids together with their alcohol and mono-glyceride derivatives against herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2. In contrast, Dichtelmuller et al (2002) reported that caprylic acid had antiviral activity against enveloped viruses including human immunodeficiency virus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus, Sindbis virus and pseudorabies virus (Dichtelmuller et al., 2002 , Pingen et al., 2016 . Studies investigating the antiviral properties of whole milk reported no antiviral properties of fresh human milk, whereas milk that had been stored at 4 o C possessed potent antiviral activity against several viruses in vitro. Refrigeration disrupts the milk fat globule membrane allowing ingress of milk serum lipase which results in hydrolysis of milk fat triglyceride (Thormar et al., 1987 , Isaacs et al., 1990 .

Caprylic acid delivered in the ViroSAL emulsion exhibited significant anti-viral effects. A range of enveloped viral infection systems was utilized, and complete inhibition of viral infection was observed without any evidence of cytotoxicity. ViroSAL had no effect on the infectivity of a non-enveloped virus, norovirus, which is in agreement with previous studies demonstrating that free fatty acids are ineffective against nonenveloped viruses (Thormar et al., 1987 , Kohn et al., 1980 . Furthermore, ViroSAL inactivated the enveloped mosquito-borne viruses Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) in vitro. Prophylactic topical treatment of viral infection in mosquito bites with ViroSAL inhibited local replication and dissemination of SFV and plasma levels of ZIKV in mice. Transmission electron microscopy analysis indicated that ViroSAL disrupts orf parapoxvirus envelope integrity, with higher concentrations completely disrupting virion morphology. These data indicate that ViroSAL has antiviral activity against a range of enveloped viruses in vitro and in vivo.\n\nHepG2, Caco-2, A549, Vero cells, RAW 264.7 murine macrophages, 293T human embryonic kidney cells and BV2 murine microglial cells were propagated in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco), antibiotics (100U of penicillin/mL and 100\u03bcg of streptomycin/mL) and 1% non-essential amino acids (Gibco). Baby hamster kidney-21 (BHK-21) cells and C6/36 mosquito cells were grown as previously described (Pingen et al., 2016) . Vero cells engineered to over-express signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) were supplemented with 0.4mg/mL of geneticin (G418, Sigma). Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF-1) cells were obtained from ATCC (ATCC\u00ae SCRC-1041\u2122), and were propagated in DMEM supplemented with 15% FBS, 2mM lglutamine, antibiotics (100U of penicillin/mL and 100\u03bcg of streptomycin/mL) and 1% non-essential amino acids). Primary tonsil epithelial cells were isolated from normal tonsil tissue obtained during hypophysectomy, as previously described (Feederle et al., 2007) . Primary foetal lamb skin (FLS) cells were isolated as previously described (Scagliarini et al., 2007) and cultured in Medium 199 with 10% heat inactivated FBS.\n\nAll cells were maintained at 37 o C, 5% CO2.\n\nAnti-HSV-1 gD antibody was a generous gift from Colin Crump, University of Cambridge (Minson et al., 1986) . Anti-mouse alexa-488 antibody was obtained from Gibco, U.K.\n\nPseudoviruses were generated by transfecting 293T cells with plasmids encoding a HIV-1 provirus expressing luciferase (pNL4-3-Luc-R-E-) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G), Zika, Ebola, Lassa or SARS coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) envelope or a no envelope control (Env-), as previously described (Fletcher et al., 2015 (Broer et al., 2006 .

Each preparation of ViroSAL was titrated in the relevant media used to culture each cell type (DMEM, Williams E and M199). To control for pH treatment, virus was treated with pH5.5 buffer that did not contain ViroSAL for 2 minutes and then pH restored to 7 as described for ViroSAL treatments and virus added to target cells. After 8 hours, unbound virus was removed and the media replaced with DMEM/3% FBS. At 72h post-infection the cells were lysed, luciferase substrate added (Promega, U.K.) and luciferase activity measured for 10 seconds in a luminometer (Lumat LB9507).\n\nSpecific infectivity was calculated by subtracting the mean Env-pp RLU signal from the pseudovirus RLU signals. Infectivity is presented relative to untreated control cells by defining the mean luciferase value of the replicate untreated cells as 100%.\n\nTo assess cell viability following ViroSAL treatment, an MTT assay was performed on replicate wells in every experiment (Gibco, U.K.).\n\nIC323 carrying the open reading frame of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was generated as described previously (Hashimoto et al., 2002) . After initial recovery, MeV was produced in Vero-SLAM cells using an initial multiplicity of infection of 0.1. When infection was fully developed, flasks were vigorously shaken and supernatants collected and clarified at 3500rpm for 30min at 4\u2070C.

Encapsidated and enveloped virus was purified from the culture supernatants by centrifugation on an OptiPrep (Axis Shield) self-generated gradient (Shannon-Lowe et al., 2009 ) and quantitated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) of a single-copy gene, BALF5, as previously described (Shannon-Lowe et al., 2006) .\n\nHerpes simplex virus (HSV-1)(Strain I7) was propagated in Vero cells as previously described (Ren et al., 2012) .

SFV plasmids were electroporated into BHK-21 cells to generate infectious virus. SFV4 is the prototypic, less virulent strain of the virus, whereas SFV6 is a copy of a virulent strain (Ferguson et al., 2015) .\n\nFor all in vivo experiments with SFV and ZIKV (Brazil, PE243), viruses were grown once in BHK-21 cells and then passaged once in C6/36 Aedes mosquito cells and titrated before use because mosquito cell-derived virus has distinct glycosylation and because insect cells impose distinct evolutionary constraints on viral progeny (Moser et al., 2018) . SFV4 and SFV6 were used at passage 2.\n\nWestgate Biomedical Ltd, Donegal, Ireland, (Folan M. Patent WO 2011/061237). All components used in the construction of ViroSAL are pharmaceutical grade constituents of greater than 97% purity. The ViroSAL emulsion used in these studies was constructed using Lipoid S75 Lecithin (Lipoid AG, Steinhausen, Switzerland) 1.26 % W/W which had been de-lipidised using solvent extraction to remove any extraneous lipid that remained conjugated to its lipophilic sites (de-lipidised lecithin is amphipathic). A co-surfactant Pluronic F-68 (BASF Cork, Ireland) was used to enhance stability and a di-palmitoyl, 1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylglycerol sodium salt (DPPG from Lipoid AG) was used to amplify surface charge on the emulsion droplet. Pharmaceutical grade caprylic acid (Merck, Nottingham, UK) 10% W/W was emulsified in the de-lipidised lecithin, Pluronic and DPPG mix 0.45% W/W and 0.54% W/W respectively using an Emulsiflex C-5 (Avestin, Ottowa, Canada) at the author/funder.

The emulsion was diluted to 2% W/W (0.2% caprylic acid), or used at the concentrations specified in each experiment, in sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.0, with a physiological isotonicity of 280mOsM, optimized for each culture medium used, and autoclaved before use (Laverty et al., 2015) .\n\nFor topical application to mouse skin, a gel formulation was constructed using 1%W/V Carbopol 974p (Lubrizol Inc, Cleveland, Ohio, USA), dispersed and hydrated in an aqueous solution of 15% glycerol (Merck) which was then pH adjusted to 5.0 before addition of 10% ViroSAL emulsion. The gel was applied liberally to test sites as described.\n\nViroSAL has an acidic pH which necessitated minimal time exposure to cell lines followed by a neutralizing buffer to restore pH to 7.0. In this study, ViroSAL at the indicated concentrations was mixed with an equal volume of viral inoculum (MeV:original TCID50 = 4.48 7 /mL, HSV-1: 100 PFU/mL, EBV: MOI=10, Zika: MOI=10, Orf: 4 PFU/mL) or pseudoviruses bearing VSV, Ebola, Lassa or SARS-CoV-1 envelope glycoproteins, and incubated at room temperature for 2 minutes. The same volume of a buffered neutralizing solution was added and mixed thoroughly to restore the pH to 7.\n\nViroSAL and neutralizing solution was optimized for each culture medium used in in vitro studies. As a control for the effect of low pH on infectivity, 200\u00b5L of pH5.5 buffer solution was added to the virus, incubated for 2min and neutralized as before.\n\nVirus/ViroSAL or control treated virus was inoculated onto appropriate target cells and incubated for 48h at 37\u00b0C, then fixed and infection enumerated, or, for pseudovirus assays, lysed and luciferase activity quantified as previously described the author/funder.

For MeV, TCID50s were calculated in VeroSLAM cells in triplicate using the Reed-Muench method (Reed, 1938) .\n\nFor non-enveloped viral infectivity assays, a similar approach was used to enveloped virus assays. ViroSAL was mixed with murine norovirus (MNV-CW1) in a 1:1 ratio, incubated at room temperature for 2 minutes and the pH was restored to 7. Virus infection of permissive RAW 264.7 (mouse macrophage) and BV2 (murine microglial) cells were conducted immediately after neutralization in triplicate, incubated at 37\u00b0C and quantified 96h post infection using TCID50 via microscopic visualization for the appearance of cytopathic effect.\n\n6-8-week-old female C57bl/6J mice were derived from a locally bred colony maintained in a pathogen-free facility, in filter-topped cages, and maintained in accordance with local and governmental regulations. To prevent genetic drift, mice have been rederived using externally supplied mice (Charles River).\n\nBecause arbovirus infection of the skin always occurs in the context of an arthropod bite, we used a mouse model that additionally incorporates biting Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Host response to mosquito bites includes oedema and an influx of leukocytes that enhances host susceptibility to infection with virus (Pingen et al., 2016) . Therefore, we used our previously established model of arbovirus infection at mosquito bites. This model was specifically developed to model natural infection by arbovirus, including mimicking the same dose delivered by mosquitoes, using mosquito cell-derived virus, injecting a small 1ul inoculum volume, and by including the presence of a mosquito bite at the site of inoculation.

Biting was restricted to a defined area of the left foot by covering all other mouse skin with an impenetrable barrier. Viral RNA and host gene transcripts in tissues were quantified by reverse transcription qPCR, and infectious virus was quantified by end point titration, as described previously. Tissue generated up to 100 ug of total RNA, of which 1 ug of RNA was used to create cDNA, of which 1% was used per qPCR assay. qPCR primers for SFV amplified a section of E1 and primers for ZIKV amplified a section of the env gene.

For all in vivoderived data, data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism Version 7 software. Copy numbers of viral RNA and infectious titres from virus-infected mice were not normally distributed (with data points often spread over orders of magnitude) and\n\nwere accordingly analyzed using the nonparametric-based Mann-Whitney test or Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.\n\nTo assess the ability of ViroSAL to inhibit viral infection, we utilized a pseudovirus system, which allows high throughput assays to assess viral entry to cells. ViroSAL inhibited entry of viral pseudoparticles bearing the envelope glycoproteins of VSV, Lassa, Ebola and SARS-CoV-1 viruses. Pseudoviral particles mirror the entry pathways of their respective wild type viruses and use the same viral receptors and entry pathways (for review, see (Li et al., 2018) ). These constructs generate high titre pseudoviruses that can be used to infect a range of cell types. Inhibition of pseudovirus entry by ViroSAL occurred in a concentration-dependent manner, when pseudoviruses were incubated with ViroSAL for 2 minutes ( Figure 1A) . Treatment of pseudoviruses with 2% ViroSAL resulted in complete neutralization of pseudovirus infectivity on 293T human embryonic kidney cells ( Figure 1A ). There was no alteration in cellular proliferation or cytotoxicity when cells were treated with pseudovirus or ViroSAL, assessed using an MTT assay (data not shown).

Treatment of VSV and Lassa pseudoviruses with pH5.5 control buffer caused no significant change in infectivity; however, a significant reduction in Ebola pseudovirus infectivity was observed ( Figure 1A ).\n\nTo establish whether ViroSAL inhibits pseudovirus infection in other cell types, ViroSAL-treated Lassa and VSV pseudoparticles were used to infect human intestinal (Caco-2) and hepatoma (HepG2) epithelial cell monolayers. Similar levels of neutralization with ViroSAL were observed compared with that of 293T cells. The inhibition of viral infectivity with pH5.5 control treatment was perhaps due to the less efficient entry of viral pseudoparticles to these cells compared with the highly permissive 293T cell line (Supplementary Figure 1) . Because many aspects of enveloped virus lifecycles are pH sensitive (Ruigrok et al., 1992) and pH is the most common variable when assessing the antimicrobial activity of fatty acids (Churchward et al., 2018) , in all cases the control against which ViroSAL treatments were compared were those exposed to virus at pH 5.5.\n\nTo test whether ViroSAL inhibits pseudovirus infection following short treatment times, VSV pseudoviruses were incubated with ViroSAL at concentrations from 0.0625% to 0.5% for 2, 1 or 0.5 minutes, and then used to infect 293T cells. A timedependent decrease in infectivity was observed ( Figure 1B) , and ViroSAL inhibited VSV pseudovirus at concentrations greater than 0.25% following 30 seconds of treatment.\n\nthe author/funder.

ViroSAL inhibited both Zika virus pseudovirus and similar to Zika virus, a higher concentration of ViroSAL (3%) was required for complete neutralization of full-length viruses compared to pseudoviruses. Treatment with 3% ViroSAL did not result in cytotoxicity, measured using MTT assays (data not shown). This indicates that ViroSAL is capable of fully neutralizing a range of enveloped viruses in vitro, at a concentration that does not cause cytotoxicity in eukaryotic cells.\n\nthe author/funder.

Murine norovirus, a non-enveloped virus, was treated with ViroSAL and added to cultures of RAW264.7 murine macrophages or BV2 murine microglial cells. There was no significant difference between control treated virus and ViroSAL treated virus infectivity in either cell type tested ( Figure   4A ). This indicates that, in contrast to ViroSAL's effect on enveloped viruses, ViroSAL does not inhibit infection with norovirus, a non-enveloped virus.\n\nactivity. To investigate the components of ViroSAL that are responsible for its activity, we evaluated individual components of ViroSAL (Caprylate, DPPG, Lecithin and Kolliphor), at concentrations equivalent to amounts present in 2% ViroSAL, together with 2% ViroSAL and 10ng/ml IFN-y as a positive antiviral control. Only Caprylate (caprylic acid) had a significant effect on VSV-G pseudovirus entry to Vero cells ( Figure 4B ). However, 2% ViroSAL fully neutralized viral entry, indicating that caprylic acid within the ViroSAL formulation was more potent as an antiviral than caprylic acid alone.\n\nTo examine the potential perturbation of enveloped virus membranes, we used transmission electron microscopy to visualize ViroSAL-treated orf virions. Orf is a parapoxvirus, a family of viruses that includes pseudocowpox and bovine papular stomatitis virus, and it was selected because of the large size of the virions (200-the author/funder.

Negatively stained virions exhibited typical poxvirus morphology ( Figure 5A) , with an ovoid structure surrounded by an external envelope. Treatment of orf virions with 1% ViroSAL, which neutralized approximately 50% infection in infection assays ( Figure 3B ), appeared to disrupt the external viral envelope, which remained associated with the virions ( Figure 5B ). Treatment with 3% ViroSAL, which completely neutralized in vitro infectivity ( Figure 3B ) disrupted virion morphology and the lattice-like structure present on intact virions ( Figure 5C ).\n\nThese data indicate that ViroSAL disrupts orf surface structure, and virion morphology.\n\nArboviruses are transmitted to their mammalian hosts via the bite of an insect vector. Given that ViroSAL has optimal activity at a slightly acidic pH, such as that seen on skin and mucosal surfaces, we investigated the effects of ViroSAL treatment on mouse skin following viral inoculation at the site of Aedes aegypti bites, according to previously published protocols (Bryden et al., 2020) . Arbovirus replication in the skin at mosquito bites is a key stage of infection during virus replicates rapidly before disseminating to the blood and other tissues (Pingen et al., 2016) . Previous work has suggested therapeutic targeting this site may be efficacious in reducing severity of infection (Bryden et al., 2020) . Here, ZIKV was chosen, as it is a medically important emerging arbovirus, whereas SFV was used as a model virus that replicates efficiently in immunocompetent mice. the author/funder.

Following immediate restoration of physiological pH, solution was applied to monolayers of BHK-21 cells and infectious titre assessed by plaque assay. As a control SFV6 was incubated similarly at pH5.5 in the absence of ViroSAL. The amount of infectious SFV was reduced to beyond the limit of detection by ViroSAL, suggesting this virus is highly sensitive to treatment (Supplementary Figure 2) . Similarly, when ViroSAL treated SFV6 was inoculated subcutaneously into mice, the titre of virus at 24 hours post infection was significantly reduced (Supplementary Figure 2) . We next determined whether topical application of ViroSAL can also suppress virus infection when virus was inoculated subcutaneously into a mosquito bite. In this experiment, ViroSAL was applied immediate post mosquito bite and left for 20 minutes to allow penetration of skin by ViroSAL, or left untreated as a control. SFV was then inoculated subcutaneously into the mosquito bite as previously described (Pingen et al., 2016) . Re-application of ViroSAL to the inoculation site was repeated at 5 hours post infection. At 24 hours post infection, those mice receiving ViroSAL had a significantly reduced amount of virus RNA at the inoculation/bite site and limited dissemination of virus to the spleen 24 hours post infection ( Figure 6A ).\n\nInfectious viral titres within plasma were also significantly reduced ( Figure 6B ).\n\nTopical application of ViroSAL to mosquito bites was similarly efficacious in reducing ZIKV serum viraemia by 24 hours post ZIKV infection ( Figure 6C ).\n\nthe author/funder.

The antimicrobial activity of medium chain saturated and long chain unsaturated free fatty acids has been reported previously (Thormar and Hilmarsson, 2007) , with both antibacterial and antiviral activity observed (Hilmarsson et al., 2005) .\n\nCaprylic acid has been used in the purification process of immunoglobulins due to its inactivation of lipid enveloped viruses (Dichtelmuller et al., 2002) , a process which is pH-dependent and optimal at low pH. Poor solubility in aqueous solutions has limited antimicrobial applications of fatty acids in their free form (Jackman et al., 2016) and dissolution in solvents such as DMSO can cause skin irritation. Formulation as nanoparticles has been described to overcome the challenges of antimicrobial fatty acid bioavailability (Jackman et al., 2016 , Yoon et al., 2018 . In this study we used patented technology (Folan, M.A. International Patent No. WO 2011/061237) to build and use an emulsion to evaluate its antiviral potential. Recent publications have noted the potential antimicrobial activity of nanoemulsions and microemulsions (Churchward et al., 2018 , Buranasuksombat et al., 2011 , Ma et al., 2016 , Donsi and Ferrari, 2016 .

We observed a significant concentration-and time-dependent (rapid) decrease in infectivity of all enveloped viruses tested in the present study, with no effect on non-enveloped norovirus. Milk-based free fatty acids, as well as fatty acid emulsions, have been shown to inhibit infection of Vero cells with VSV and HSV-1, with no antiviral effect on poliovirus, a non-enveloped virus (Thormar et al., 1987) . Moreover, Isaacs (Isaacs et al., 1990) reported no antiviral activity of human milk or milk formula, but potent antiviral activity of milk aspirated from the stomachs of infants one hour after feeding, which occurred due to the release of free fatty acids by lipolysis. Similar observations were reported by Thormar et al. (Thormar et al., 1994) , after lipolysis by storage of human milk at 4\u00b0C.\n\nFollowing treatment of orf virus with ViroSAL, we observed a dissociation of the viral envelope from virions, with higher concentrations disrupting virion integrity and morphology. In agreement with the present study, fatty acids were found to affect the viral envelope, with high concentrations causing complete disintegration of viral particles (Thormar et al., 1987 , Thormar et al., 1994 . In agreement with the present study, previous studies have also reported no antiviral effect of fatty acids on nonenveloped viruses (Thormar et al., 1987 , Churchward et al., 2018 , indicating that the antiviral mechanism of free fatty acids and ViroSAL may involve the viral envelope and we anticipate that to be due to a surfactant effect (Yoon et al., 2015 , Yoon et al., 2017 . the author/funder.

ViroSAL has optimal activity at pH5.5 and is consequently suitable for use in environments close to this pH, such as skin, oral cavity and mucous membranes which are also relevant portals of infection. The present study demonstrated that ViroSAL has antiviral activity against HSV-1, EBV and orf viruses, all of which are pathogens of skin or mucous membranes and have a tropism for epithelial cells. Since ViroSAL has optimal activity at pH5.5, we also tested a range of epithelial cell systems that would physiologically have a lower pH than that of plasma, such as skin which has a pH of approximately 5 (Lambers et al., 2006) and the oral cavity which can have a pH of 6.5 or lower depending on the level of oral health. ViroSAL had strong antiviral activity against Semliki Forest and Zika viruses, which are transmitted via mosquitoes into the skin dermis. This is an important stage of the virus life cycle, in which it replicates in dermal cells before disseminating to the blood and then throughout the body (Hamel et al., 2015; Pingen et al., 2017) .\n\nThe potential of ViroSAL as a topical application immediately following mosquito bites is of great interest, as established and emerging mosquito-borne viruses constitute an increasing threat to human health. Treatment modalities that incorporate ViroSAL to target skin arbovirus infection should be explored further as e.g. treatment of the mosquito bite inoculation site with an immunomodulator has recently been shown to be an effective strategy in suppressing arbovirus infection (Bryden et al., 2020) . Moreover, ViroSAL also neutralized measles virus and SARS-CoV-1 pseudovirus infection. Measles is an aerosol transmitted infection that initially targets macrophages and dendritic cells of the upper airway, which are then the author/funder. All rights reserved.

Similarly, SARS-CoV-1 causes an acute interstitial pneumonia and was the causative agent of the 2002 SARS coronavirus epidemic. ViroSAL, therefore, has potential applications as a topical or inhaled therapy to treat epitheliotropic viral infections or those that infect the airway or other mucous membranes. The fact that ViroSAL has applications against a wide range of enveloped viruses is of great interest, and while many antivirals have activity against specific viral families, there are few broad-spectrum antivirals currently available. Therefore, these data provide a rationale for future pre-clinical studies to investigate the antiviral properties of ViroSAL in viral infections of mucous membranes including the airway and skin.\n\nViroSAL may have applications in current and future viral outbreaks, including the current pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. Ebola or the spike protein of SARS-CoV-1 was treated in a 1:1 dilution with concentrations of ViroSAL ranging from 4% to 0.125% (final concentrations ranged from 2% to 0.0625%) for 2 minutes. Buffer was then added to restore the pH to 7. To control for the effect of pH on viral infectivity, virus was treated with a pH5.5 buffer, equivalent to that of ViroSAL, for 2 minutes and then the pH of the virus was restored to 7. Pseudoviruses were used to infect 293T human embryonic kidney cells. 10ng/ml IFN-y was included as a positive antiviral control. Data are presented as mean infectivity \u00b1 SD relative to the untreated virus control.
