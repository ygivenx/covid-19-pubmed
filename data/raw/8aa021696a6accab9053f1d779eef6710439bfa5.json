{"title": "Quantifying transmission of emerging zoonoses: 3 Using mathematical models to maximize the value of surveillance data 4 5 6 7", "body": "Introduction 54 Many recent infectious disease threats have been caused by pathogens with zoonotic 55 origins, including Ebola, pandemic H1N1 influenza, and SARS-and MERS-Coronaviruses, and 56 zoonotic pathogens are expected to be a primary source of future emerging infectious diseases 57 control measure, implemented at a known point in time, causes an abrupt reduction in spillover. 135 A related approach that requires knowledge of the human and animal reservoir population sizes 136 was also explored in Lo Iacono et al. [35] . Crucially, however, none of these methods 137 incorporate information about the spatial location of cases to improve inference power or to 138 estimate patterns of spatial spread. Spatial data is a powerful tool in transmission inference in 139 single-species studies (e.g. [36] [37] [38] [39] ), but has largely been excluded from analyses of zoonotic 140 transmission, which often implicitly assume homogenous mixing across the study area or that 141 human-to-human transmission can only occur within a locality. One recent exception to this is 142 the analysis by Cauchemez et al. [40] , which includes transmission at several spatial levels. 143\n\nIn this work, we present model-based inference methods that allow us to infer R, the 144 spillover rate, and properties of spatial spread among humans from surveillance datasets with 145 non-localized spatial information and an unknown total number of surveilled localities. Our 146 approach builds on methods introduced by White and Pagano [33] and Kucharski et al. [34] , but 147 allows continuous spillover throughout the surveillance period and makes use of available spatial 148 information on case location. While the method could be readily adjusted to incorporate more 149 than with individuals from other localities, and therefore that infection is more likely to be 158 transmitted within a locality. However, the total number of localities under surveillance is 159 unknown because only localities with one or more cases appear in the dataset (the 'unknown 160 denominator' problem discussed above). We refer to the second spatial level as the 'broader 161 contact zone.' It describes a collection of localities that all occur within the same administrative 162 unit and likely share some amount of human movement. When multiple types of administrative 163 units of different sizes are reported in the dataset (e.g., districts, regions, provinces, etc.), the 164 ideal choice for broader contact zone is the smallest administrative unit that contains inter-165 locality human-to-human transmission events. If this scale is not known a priori, inferring the 166 appropriate scale of administrative unit is necessary. \n\nWe first validated the inference framework using a simulation study, then applied the 215 Across 125 simulations (25 simulations for each of five parameter sets), estimated values 245 clustered around the true parameter values. The true value for R was included in the 95% 246 credible interval (CI) 119 times (95.2%) and for \u03bb z was included 121 times (96.8%) (Fig 3A) . On 247 average, the posterior mean estimate of R differed from the true value by 8.6%; the analogous 248 percent errors for \u03bb z and \u03c3 estimates were 6.3% and 7.0%, respectively (S1 Table) . Inferences were performed A) when the true number of localities under surveillance was known, 254 B) when the true number was unknown and it was assumed that the number of observed 255 localities was the total number of localities, and C) when the true number of localities was 256 unknown and the corrected-denominator method was used to control for the locality observation 257 process. 258 259 However, this method assumes that the true number of localities under surveillance is 260 known. In real-world situations, 'silent' localities that experience zero cases often do not appear 261 in the dataset, resulting in an unknown true number of surveilled localities. We investigated 262 possible biases in parameter estimates that could arise from assuming that the number of 263 localities that reported one or more cases represents the total number of localities under 264 surveillance. To do so, we used the same set of simulated datasets as described above, but 265 removed knowledge about the number of silent localities. In these datasets, silent localities make 266 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/677021 doi: bioRxiv preprint up between 21% and 85% of all localities under surveillance, with the proportion driven 267 primarily by the spillover rate. Estimates for the reproductive number R were not strongly 268 impacted (95.2% of the 95% CIs contained the true value with an average percent error of 8.4%), 269 but the spillover rate \u03bb z was consistently overestimated (Fig 3B) . The true value for \u03bb z was 270 contained in none of the simulations' 95% CIs and the posterior mean had an average percent 271 error of 153% (S1 Table) . 272\n\nTo further investigate the effect of this data truncation (whereby localities with zero cases 273 do not appear in the dataset), we performed inference assuming that the observed localities 274 represented all, 1/2, or 1/5 of the total localities under surveillance. While this assumption had a 275 relatively small impact on the estimated R, it greatly impacted the inferred \u03bb z (which is measured 276 as the number of spillover events per locality per day and is therefore strongly affected by 277 changes in the assumed number of localities) (S1 Fig). Assuming that a larger fraction of 278 surveilled localities appear in the dataset resulted in substantially higher estimated spillover 279 rates. 280\n\nBecause 281 the total number of localities assumed to be under surveillance has a substantial impact on 282 parameter estimates, we developed a modified version of the likelihood function that accounts 283 for localities that were under surveillance but never observed in the dataset. This approach 284 calculates the likelihood of the observed dataset conditional on the fact that only localities with 285 one or more cases are included (details on the modified likelihood function can be found in 286\n\nMethods and S1 Text). 287 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/677021 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nWe tested the performance of the corrected-denominator method against simulated 288 datasets, looking at the same parameter sets as in the first section. The inferred parameter values 289 cluster well with their corresponding true values ( Fig 3C) : mean percent error in R estimates was 290 8.4% and in \u03bb z estimates was 14.0%. Across the 125 simulations, the true parameter value was 291 included in the 95% CI 116 times (92.8%) for R and 117 times (93.6%) for \u03bb z (S1 Table) . 292\n\nBecause an estimate of the true number of localities under surveillance would help 293 determine the size of the population that could be detected for a given system, we assessed how 294 well we could approximate this value. Given the number of localities with one or more cases and 295 the mean parameter estimates, it is possible to calculate the expected total number of localities 296 under surveillance (see S1 Text). Estimates of the true number of localities calculated for the 297 simulated datasets center on the correct value (S2 Fig). The magnitude of estimate error is driven 298 by the spillover rate, which largely determines the proportion of localities that are observed by 299 surveillance. The mean percent error across simulations with spillover rate of 0.0001, 0.00036, 300 and 0.0007 were 25.4%, 7.9%, and 2.4%, respectively, while simulations with spillover rates of 301 0.004 and above almost always recorded at least one case in each locality during the five year 302 surveillance period and therefore tended to estimate the exact true number of localities. 303\n\nInferring the sources of transmission events. We investigated how well sampled transmission 304 trees recovered the source of individual cases as well as higher-order measures, such as the 305 fraction of cases originating from zoonotic, within-locality, and between-locality transmission. 306\n\nWhen comparing the overall fraction of cases attributed to each source type (zoonotic 311 versus within-locality versus between-locality transmission), the sampled transmission trees 312 closely match the true transmission patterns (Fig 4) . On average, the difference between the true 313 fraction of cases caused by zoonotic spillover and the fraction inferred in a tree was 0.022 314 (standard deviation 0.018), the difference for within-locality transmission was 0.006 (standard 315 deviation 0.005), and the difference for between-locality transmission was 0.022 (standard 316 deviation 0.018). values. If the fraction of transmissions for each source is perfectly inferred, points will lie exactly 324 on the transition between bar colors. B. Box plots summarize the error in the inferred fraction of 325 cases originating from each source type. The error size is small across all parameter sets, 326 especially for within-locality human-to-human transmission. The upper whisker was calculated 327 as min(max(x), Q 3 +1.5*IQR) and the lower whisker was calculated as max(min(x),Q 1 -1.5*IQR). 328\n\nThe success at recovering individual transmission links was high overall but varied 330 slightly depending on the true parameters underlying the simulation (S3 Fig). On average, 331 sampled transmission trees inferred 85.9% of all sources correctly. Better performance was 332 .

Some transmission links were more likely to be captured than others: on 334 average 90.9% and 90.1% of sampled trees correctly inferred links with zoonotic and within-335 locality sources, respectively, but only 36.8% of trees correctly identified the source of between-336 locality transmission events. 337\n\nApplying the corrected-denominator method to 1980s monkeypox surveillance data. 339\n\nBetween 1982 and 1986, the active monkeypox surveillance program in the Democratic 340\n\nRepublic of the Congo detected 331 human cases in 171 localities [43] . For each human case, we 341 know the name of the locality as well as the district or administrative subregion (henceforth 342 referred to simply as 'district') and region to which it belongs. However, the total number of 343 localities that would have been detected by surveillance had they experienced a case is unknown. 344\n\nWe therefore used the corrected-denominator method to generate estimates under four different 345 assumptions about which administrative unit most suitably represents the broader contact zone. 346\n\nThe country-level, region-level, and district-level models correspond to progressively smaller 347 choices of broader contact zones, while the locality-level model assumes that all instances of 348 human-to-human transmission occur within a locality. We anticipate that assuming an 349 excessively large broader contact zone could result in overestimating R and underestimating \u03bb z if 350 too many spurious human-to-human transmission events are inferred from pairs of cases that just 351 happen to occur within a generation-time interval of one another, while assuming an 352 inappropriately small broader contact zone could result in the opposite parameter biases if the 353 model is unable to detect actual incidents of human-to-human transmission because the cases 354 occur in different (assumed) broader contact zones. 355 .

When larger 357 administrative units are assumed to represent the broader contact zone, a given pair of cases is 358 more likely to belong to the same broader contact zone, giving the model more opportunities to 359 infer inter-locality human-to-human transmission events and resulting in larger estimated 360 reproductive number R and a smaller spillover rate \u03bb z . Mean values of the posterior distribution 361 of R range from 0.29 when transmission is assumed to occur only within localities to 0.52 when 362 transmission is assumed to occur among all localities in the country (Table 1) Both the choice of broader contact zone and the assumed total number of localities have a 407 large impact on estimates of R and \u03bb z ( Fig 5B) . As noted above, models assuming smaller 408 broader contact zones allow fewer opportunities for human-to-human transmissions to be 409 inferred, and these models estimate substantially lower R values and correspondingly higher 410 spillover rates. In contrast, assuming that a smaller fraction of surveilled localities were observed 411 .

It District-level broader contact zone preferred in model comparisons. To assess which broader 427 contact zone assumption is most appropriate for the monkeypox system, we used the deviance 428 information criterion (DIC) to perform model comparisons for the corrected-denominator 429 method as well as for each assumption about the number of surveilled localities. For the 430 corrected-denominator method, the district-level model had the best DIC score, followed by the 431 region and country-level models ( Table 1) . The locality-level model received a much larger DIC 432 value, indicating that the data strongly support models that allow transmission between localities. 433 .

We used the district-level 436 corrected-denominator method to sample 20,000 transmission trees for the monkeypox dataset. 437\n\nThe sampled transmission trees attributed an average of 60.8% (standard deviation of 2.2%) of 438 cases to zoonotic spillover, 28.5% (standard deviation of 0.9%) of cases to within-locality 439 human-to-human transmission, and 10.7% (standard deviation of 2.1%) of cases to between-440 locality human-to-human transmission. . The highest success was seen for pairs of epidemiologically-linked cases whose dates of 475 symptom onset were between 7 and 25 days apart ( Fig 7B) .

It is possible that these links, which were often missed in the 479 sampled transmission trees, are not true instances of human-to-human transmission. Cases that 480 occurred in different localities were also less likely to be linked in a sampled transmission tree, 481 though even for these inter-locality pairs, the district-level model tended to perform better than 482 the other three models (S6 Fig The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/677021 doi: bioRxiv preprint Comparison of the transmission tree generated using only contact-tracing data with the 500 trees created using the district-level and locality-level models highlights how much our 501 perception of the transmission dynamics depends on assumptions about spatial spread (Fig 8) . 502\n\nMost of the within-locality transmission links detected through epidemiological contact-tracing 503 appear in the locality-level model's tree, though the locality-level tree suggests substantially 504 more human-to-human transmission events than captured in the contact-tracing tree. However, 505 the locality-level tree misses all inter-locality links. The district-level model's tree captures most 506 of the links indicated by the locality-level tree, and also suggests that inter-locality transmission 507 is occurring, though it has low power to determine exactly which case pairs are linked through 508 inter-locality transmission.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/677021 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nWe conducted a variety of sensitivity analysis tests using simulated datasets to assess 521 how robust the method was over a range of parameter values and assumption violations (full 522 descriptions are provided in S1 Text). The method continued to perform well even at very high 523 spillover rates (S7 Fig, S2 Table) and when the offspring distribution used in simulations 524 differed from the one assumed in the inference (S8 Fig, S3 Table) . In some situations, assuming 525 a larger broader contact zone than the one used for simulations could lead to an overestimation of 526 R and an underestimation of \u03bb z (S4 and S5 Tables). This outcome is consistent with what was 527 observed in the monkeypox analysis where assuming a larger spatial scale for the broader contact 528 zone corresponded to a higher estimate of R and a smaller estimate of the spillover rate (Fig 5) . 529\n\nWhen simulations were run with highly structured, non-homogeneous spillover, substantial 530 biases in the inference results occurred because this spillover process gives rise to clusters of 531 primary cases that the model mistakes as arising from human-to-human transmission (S9 Fig) . 532\n\nIn this work, we developed and tested a method to infer fundamental epidemiological 535 parameters and transmission patterns for zoonotic pathogens from epidemiological surveillance 536 data with aggregated spatial information. When tested against simulated datasets, the method 537 successfully recovered estimates of R and spillover rate close to the true values and also inferred 538 the fraction of cases resulting from zoonotic, within-locality, and between-locality sources with a 539 high degree of accuracy.

Of the four assumptions we tested for 546 the spatial scale of the broader contact zone, the district-level model was best supported by DIC 547 model comparisons and validation with contact-tracing. In addition, the signal of elevated inter-548 locality transmission occurring over \u2264 30 kilometers suggests that most inter-locality 549 transmissions occur in a relatively small neighborhood, consistent with the limited transportation 550 infrastructure in the DRC. This further corroborates that the district-level model, which is the 551 smallest spatial aggregation scale that still permits inter-locality transmission, is likely the most 552 appropriate choice for capturing inter-locality transmission patterns of human monkeypox. 553\n\nThe district-level model estimates a reproductive number for human monkeypox of 0.38 554 (0.31-0.45 95% CI). This value is slightly higher than previous estimates of R for the 1980s DRC 555 monkeypox dataset, which was estimated as 0.

The size of the DRC's districts and administrative subregions used for the district-565 level model vary in size, but average around fifteen thousand square kilometers, or around one 566 hundred forty kilometers across, encompassing a much greater distance than most human-to-567 human transmission events likely occur over. We therefore expect that the true value of R is 568 bounded by the estimates of the locality-level and the district-level models. 569\n\nIn addition to providing an estimate of monkeypox's reproductive number, the methods 570\n\ngive insight into the frequency of spillover and the spatial scale of human-to-human 571 transmission. The district-level model estimates a mean spillover rate of around 0.11 spillover 572 events per locality per year, which corresponds to roughly one spillover event every nine years in 573 each locality. It also estimated that around 70% of human-to-human transmissions occur within a 574 locality. This finding contrasts with the assumption that human-to-human transmission occurs 575 within a locality, which is commonly used to generate transmission clusters, and suggests that 576 estimates generated using that assumption may substantially underestimate the amount of 577 human-to-human transmission occurring in the system. The importance of inter-locality contacts 578 has been reported for the neighboring country of Uganda, where a survey by le Polain de 579\n\nWaroux et al.\n\n[55] on rural movement and social contact patterns indicated that 12% of social 580 contacts occurred outside participants' village of residence. 581\n\nAmong human monkeypox cases with recorded geographical coordinates, a clear signal 582 emerged of higher rates of human-to-human transmission between localities \u2264 30 kilometers 583 apart. This pattern seems reasonable given the infrastructure and general difficulty of 584 transportation in the more remote regions of the DRC. It also suggests a similar pattern of 585 Spatial scale of transmission and aggregated spatial data 588\n\nThe potential biases introduced when analyzing data reported at a course spatial scale 589 have been explored in a wide range of contexts [56] [57] [58] , yet the implications of using this type of 590 spatial information to infer the transmission dynamics of an infectious disease is not obvious. 591\n\nWhen spatial information is only reported at the level of large spatial zones like districts, regions, 592 or countries, no finer-scale information is available to inform which human cases transmitted 593 infection to one another between different localities. Here we explored how the size of these 594 spatial zones would affect inference for the monkeypox system by repeating the analysis using 595 spatial information at the district, region, or country resolution. The large differences in 596 parameter estimates generated under different broader contact zone assumptions in the 597 monkeypox analysis illustrates how sensitive inference results can be to the spatial scale 598 assumed for human-to-human transmission, and suggests that reporting spatial data at too large a 599 scale or ignoring inter-locality transmissions can lead to substantial estimate biases.

Many 612 methods implicitly assume a certain scale of spatial transmission, often ignoring the possibility 613 of longer-range transmissions, so careful consideration of whether that scale is appropriate for 614 the system is essential. 615\n\nIn general, recording precise spatial locations of cases is vital for increasing the 616 inferential power of modeling analyses. Developing methods that maintain spatial information 617 without risking a breach in confidentiality is a nontrivial challenge, but progress has already been 618 made in generating possible solutions such as geographic masking or the verified neighbor 619 approach [59,60]. 620\n\nIn this work, we assumed that the spillover rate was homogenous through time and space, 622 but more complex disease dynamics in the reservoir or spatiotemporal heterogeneity in animal-623 human contacts may cause nontrivial deviations from this assumption in real-world systems. Of 624 particular concern is the possibility that outbreaks in the reservoir could cause periods of 625 amplified local spillover, which could create a clustering pattern of human cases potentially 626 indistinguishable from human-to-human transmission. Without information about disease 627 dynamics in the reservoir, accounting for this heterogeneous spillover will be challenging, but 628 .

We anticipate that these 679 methods will have greatest value in the common circumstance when the source of cases, 680 particularly whether a case came from an animal or human source, cannot be readily established. 681\n\nIn such situations, the ability to infer the pathogen's reproductive number, spillover rate, and 682 spatial spread patterns from available surveillance data, will greatly enhance our understanding 683 of the pathogen's behavior and could provide valuable insights to help guide surveillance design 684 and outbreak response. 685\n\nIn broad terms, the model describes the probability of observing a set of symptom onset 688 times and locations of human cases given the timing and location of previous cases and 689 parameters that underlie the transmission process. Human infections can arise from either 690 animal-to-human transmission ('zoonotic spillover') or human-to-human transmission (Fig 1B) . 691\n\nHuman-to-human contact occurs more frequently within a locality than between localities, but 692\n\ncan still occur between localities that belong to the same broader contact zone (Fig 1A) . 693 .

For simplicity and 696 because reservoir disease dynamics are rarely well characterized, we assume the Poisson process 697 is homogenous through time and across localities, but this assumption could be modified for a 698 system where more information is available about the reservoir dynamics (e.g., The factor that describes the amount of transmission that occurs between localities v and 723 w (H(v,w)) could reflect Euclidean distance, travel time, inclusion in different spatial zones, or 724 any other available measurement. To accommodate the imperfect spatial information available 725 for many zoonotic surveillance systems, this study focused on developing methods for the 726 situation when only a locality name and an aggregated spatial zone (such as district or country) is 727 reported for cases, rather than an exact position. We assume that inter-locality transmission 728 occurs only among localities within the same broader contact zone (Fig 1A) . Because 729 transmission will be greater within a locality than between localities, a proportion \u03c3 of secondary 730 cases are assumed to occur in the same locality as the source case and a proportion (1-\u03c3) of 731 secondary cases are assumed to occur amongst the outside localities that are within the same 732 broader contact zone as the source case. This outside transmission is assumed to be divided 733 equally among all localities within the index case's broader contact zone: 734 where Z v indicates the broader contact zone of locality v and v is the total number of localities 736 in the broader contact zone of locality v. For a given locality v, the sum of H(v,w) across all w 737 equals one. To observe the effect of assuming different broader contact zones, the monkeypox 738 case study was repeated under four different assumptions about the spatial scale of human-to-739 human transmission: locality, district, region, and country-level. 740\n\nLikelihood function. Using the model described above, a likelihood function was used to 742 evaluate a parameter set (\u03b8 = {R, \u03bb z , \u03c3}) given the data (D = N t,v cases observed on each day t and 743\n\nlocality v): 744\n\nwhere T is the number of days surveillance was conducted and V is the total number of localities 746 under surveillance. 747\n\nWhile this approach works well when the total number of surveilled localities is known 748 (see Fig 3A) , localities often only appear in the dataset if they have reported cases; as a result we 749 may not know the total number of localities under surveillance. Ignoring localities with zero 750 cases can lead to biased parameter estimates (see Fig 3B) . We explored several alternative 751 approaches to account for these silent localities; the preferred approach rescales the likelihood 752 function to reflect that localities with zero cases are not included in the data.

Instead, we observe W localities that 1203 have one or more observed cases. If we re-arrange the product functions in the likelihood 1204 function, it becomes more apparent that we are taking the product of the likelihood for each 1205 locality: 1206\n\nHowever, because we only observe localities with one or more cases in the surveillance data, we 1208 need that conditioning to be reflected in the likelihood. In other words, we now want to express 1209 the likelihood of a particular time-series of cases in a locality conditional on that locality having 1210 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/677021 doi: bioRxiv preprint one or more cases. This can be done for each locality by multiplying its component of the 1211 likelihood by the inverse of the probability (q) of having one or more cases: 1212\n\n(4) 1213\n\nIt is now necessary to calculate the probability a surveilled locality experiences one or 1214 more cases. This probability is equivalent to one minus the probability of no cases occurring at a 1215 locality during the surveillance period. The following section explains how the probability of 1216 zero cases occurring at a given locality (here denoted p) is calculated. 1217\n\nFor zero cases to occur in a locality, there must be no zoonotic spillover into that locality 1218 as well as no human-to-human transmission from an outside locality. The zoonotic component is 1219 relatively straightforward to calculate, as it is simply the probability of zero spillover events on 1220 each of the T days (which equals ). The probability of no transmission from an outside 1221 human source is a bit more complicated and can be broken down by the generation of the outside 1222 case to avoid double-counting. The generation of a case indicates how many human-to-human 1223 transmission events occurred leading to the case. We refer to cases resulting from zoonotic 1224 spillover as primary cases. Individuals infected by primary cases are second generation cases, 1225 individuals infected by second generation cases are third generation cases, etc. For there to be no 1226 cases in a locality, no transmission may have occurred into that locality from outside cases in any 1227 generation: 1228 The number of cases caused by a given case (of any generation) in the target locality is 1229 described by a Poisson distribution with expected value equal to Estimating total number of localities under surveillance 1264 We wish to use the estimated parameter values for R, \u03bb z , and \u03c3 in conjunction with the 1265 number of observed localities in a broader contact zone (W w ) to estimate the total number of 1266 localities under surveillance in that broader contact zone (V w ). If we let q be the probability a 1267 locality is observed (has one or more cases during the surveillance period), then we expect V w *q 1268 \u2248 W w . From the section above, we approximate q = 1-p as: 1269\n\nSo we estimate V w as the value that satisfies the equation: 1271\n\nis equal between all locality pairs, we expect that the actual amount of shared transmission 1276 between two localities is strongly influenced by the distance between those localities. We 1277 conducted two simulations using localities with set geographic locations and inter-locality 1278 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/677021 doi: bioRxiv preprint transmissions depending on the spatial relationship of the localities. We took the 178 GPS 1279 records available from monkeypox surveillance in the DRC during the 1980s and simulated 1280 transmission across localities with the same coordinates and the same district and region 1281 boundaries. Two types of inter-locality transmission rules were explored. In the first of these, 1282 inter-locality transmissions were assumed to occur equally into a source locality's five closest 1283 neighbors. In the second set of simulations, inter-locality transmissions from a source locality 1284 were assumed to occur equally among all outside localities within 30 km of the source locality. 1285\n\nTo illustrate how highly structured and non-homogeneous spillover could bias parameter 1287 estimates, we simulated an extreme case of a zoonotic epidemic traveling through time and 1288 space. We imagined that disease dynamics in the reservoir would occur in a single location for 1289 25 days before moving to a new spot, in an extreme form of a traveling zoonotic epidemic. For 1290 each 25 day period, three localities (selected to be in the same district when possible) would be 1291 selected to experience all of the spillover in the entire system. Aside from this extreme spillover 1292 pattern, the simulation followed the district-level model. 1293\n\nTo test whether a high rate of spillover would inundate the system with so many cases 1296 that the temporal clustering patterns resulting from human-to-human transmission could be 1297 obscured, we simulated datasets with spillover rates up to 0.1. This value corresponds with an 1298 expected 59,312.5 spillover events during the five year simulation, which corresponds to an 1299 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/677021 doi: bioRxiv preprint average of 36.5 per year in each locality. At this rate of spillover, there is an average of only ten 1300 days between spillover events, a shorter period than the mean generation time for human-to-1301 human transmission events, which was sixteen days. Across the range of spillover rates tested, 1302 the method did very well at both point estimates and capturing the true parameter values within 1303 the 95% CI (an average of 94.3% of CIs included the true value of R and 94.9% included the true 1304 value of \u03bb z ; S7 Fig, S2 Table) . As the spillover rate increased from 0.0001 to 0.1, estimates of R 1305 tended to improve (posterior means closer to true value and smaller CIs). While the absolute 1306 error on estimates of \u03bb z increased as spillover rate increased, the relative error tended to decrease. 1307\n\nAs such, it appears that elevated spillover rates, far from obscuring patterns, may actually 1308 correspond with improved estimates, presumably due to the increased inference power resulting 1309 from a larger number of cases. 1310\n\nSpillover is unlikely to occur homogeneously through time and space in real-world 1311 settings. As an illustration of the potential effect this occurrence could have on parameter 1312 estimates, we simulated an extreme case (see 'Simulations with highly structured and non-1313 homogeneous spillover patterns,' above) where spillover occurs into three localities at a time. 1314\n\nThe parameter inference results for this situation were strongly biased (S10 Fig). 1315\n\nThe model used in this study assumes that the number of new cases caused by an 1317 infectious individual follows a Poisson distribution, but previous work suggests that the offspring 1318 distribution is often better characterized by a negative binomial distribution, which allows for a 1319 greater amount of variation between individuals [1]. We simulated datasets using a negative 1320 binomial offspring distribution (using a dispersion parameter k=0.58 in accordance with previous 1321 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/677021 doi: bioRxiv preprint estimates for monkeypox from [1]) and examined how well our inference method, which 1322 assumes a Poisson offspring distribution, estimated the true parameter values. Estimates for these 1323 datasets were only marginally less accurate than estimates for datasets generated with a Poisson 1324 offspring distribution (with an average percent error of 10.9% as opposed to 8.2% for R and of 1325 11.6% as opposed to 10.4% for spillover rate estimates) (S8 Fig, S3 Table) . As such, there are 1326 unlikely to be strong biases introduced from a mis-specified offspring distribution for the 1327 monkeypox dataset, though this bias could increase if applied to pathogens with more extreme 1328 transmission variance. 1329\n\nTo examine how assuming different broader contact zones would affect inference results, 1331 we compared parameter estimates obtained under three choices of broader contact zones for data 1332 simulated under two inter-locality transmission rules. We simulated disease spread in a system 1333 where localities were placed in the same arrangement as seen in 178 localities with GPS 1334 coordinates included in the monkeypox surveillance system, district and region arrangement 1335 were the same as in the 1980s surveillance, and human-to-human transmission could occur either 1336 between a locality and its five closest neighbors or between localities located within 30 km of 1337 one another. Inference results again showed increasing estimates of R and decreasing estimates 1338 of spillover rate as the size of the assumed broader contact zone increased (S4 and S5 Table) . 1339 1340 .
