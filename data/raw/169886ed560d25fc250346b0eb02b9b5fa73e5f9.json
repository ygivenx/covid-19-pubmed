{"title": "Immune Cell Profiling of COVID-19 Patients in the Recovery Stage by Single-Cell Sequencing", "body": "COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread in many countries [1] [2] [3] . As of March 21, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has affected over 300,000 people and killed more than 10,000 of those affected in more than 160 countries. Following its global spread, the World Health Organization declared it a public health emergency of international concern [4] .\n\nCOVID-19 shows symptoms of fever, dry cough, fatigue, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, and pneumonia.\n\nSome patients develop severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or multiple organ failure [5] [6] [7] . Although scientists and clinicians worldwide have made great efforts to produce vaccines and explored antiviral drugs [8, 9] , there is still no specific medicine and effective clinical treatment for COVID-19 [10, 11] .\n\nImmune system dysregulation, such as lymphopenia and inflammatory cytokine storm, have been observed and are believed to be associated with the severity of pathogenic coronavirus infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections [12, 13] . With regard to COVID-19, recent studies also found decreases in lymphocyte numbers and increases in serum inflammatory cytokine levels in peripheral blood [5, 14] . However, the manner in which key immune cell subsets change and their states during COVID-19 have remained largely unclear. Thus, defining these key cellular subsets and their states in COVID-19 is a crucial step in obtaining critical insights into the immune clearance mechanism and developing new therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.\n\nHere, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to comprehensively characterize the changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 10 COVID-19 patients. Our study depicts a high-resolution transcriptome landscape of blood immune cell subsets during the recovery stage of COVID-19. It reveals that, compared to that in the healthy controls (HCs), monocytes containing high inflammatory gene expression and IL1\u03b2 + subsets predominated, whereas CD4 + T cells decreased remarkably in patients in the early recovery stage of COVID-19. We found that T and B cell clones were highly expanded during the recovery stage in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, several specific BCR changes in COVID-19 patients during the recovery stage may be helpful for vaccine and antibody production.\n\nTo map the immune microenvironment of COVID-19 patients, we identified mirroring changes in the blood and pinpointed cell-specific alterations associated with disease severity and recovery; we then integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), single-cell paired BCR, and single-cell paired TCR analysis from a total of 10 COVID-19 patients in the early recovery stage (ERS) or late recovery stage (LRS) (70,858 PBMCs). We also collected scRNA-seq data (57,238 cells) from five healthy donors as controls ( Fig. 1A and Fig. S1 ). This dataset passed stringent high-quality filtering.\n\nSingle-cell suspensions of the scRNA-seq samples were converted to barcoded scRNA-seq libraries using 10X Genomics. CellRanger software (version 3.1.0) was used for the initial processing of the sequencing data.\n\nUsing t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), we analyzed the distribution of the three immune cell lineages, myeloid, NKT, and B cells, based on the expression of canonical lineage markers and other genes specifically upregulated in each cluster (Fig. 1B, C) . For marker genes, expression values in each cell positioned in a t-SNE are shown in Fig. 1D . We next clustered the cells of each lineage separately and identified a total of 20 immune cell clusters.\n\nThe immune cell compartment of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 infection comprised all major immune lineages. We analyzed 128,096 scRNA-seq profiles that passed quality control, including 36,442 myeloid cells, 64,247 NKT cells, and 10,177 B cells from five HCs, five ERS, and five LRS patients. The sketchy clustering analysis landscape of each subject is presented in Fig. S2A , and the merged image of each group is shown in Fig. 2A . We discovered that COVID-19 patients, including ERS and LRS, demonstrated a higher proportion of myeloid cells compared to the HCs, but with a lower proportion of NKT cells (Fig. 2B, C) . Interestingly, LRS patients had more B cells and NKT cells, but less myeloid cells, than the ERS patients (Fig. 2B, C) . Thus, these findings indicated that COVID-19 patients had decreased lymphocyte counts and increased counts of myeloid cells in peripheral blood.\n\nTo further understand the changes in the myeloid, NKT, and B cells in COVID-19 patients, we conducted differential expression gene (DEG) analysis of the NKT, B, and myeloid cells between the HCs and patients. The heat maps are shown in Fig. 2D -F. Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as IL1B, CCL3, IRF1, DUSP1, JUN, and FOS were all expressed at high levels in patients, regardless of myeloid cells (Fig. 2D ), NKT cells (Fig. 2E ), or B cells (Fig. 2F) .\n\nCollectively, our results demonstrated that myeloid cells increased, whereas NKT cells decreased in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients and that the immune cell compositions differed between the patients in the ERS and LRS.\n\nTo further understand the changes in the monocytes in patients in the early and late recovery stages of COVID-19, we conducted gene expression analysis and sub-clustered the myeloid cells into six transcriptionally distinct subsets using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP).\n\nClassical CD14 ++ monocytes (M1), non-classical CD16 ++ (FCGR3A) CD14 -/+ monocytes (M2), intermediate CD14 ++ CD16 + monocytes (M3), CD1C + cDC2 (M4), CLEC9A + cDC1 (M5), and pDC (CLEC4C + CD123 + ) (M6) were present in the six distinct clusters (Fig. 3A , B, and S). We found that the compartment of the monocyte subset differed remarkably among the HCs and COVID-19 patients (Fig. 3C ). Among the myeloid cells, the ratio of classical CD14 ++ monocytes (M1) higher in the ERS patients than in the HCs and was almost normal in the LRS patients (Fig. 3C ).\n\nWe found that COVID-19 patients had a greater abundance of CD14 ++ IL1\u03b2 + monocytes and IFN-activated monocytes than the HCs (Fig. 3D-F ). Genes associated with CD14 ++ inflammatory monocytes (M1) had high expression levels of inflammatory genes such as IL1\u03b2, JUN, FOS, JUNB, and KLF6; chemokines, CCL4, CXCR4; and interferon-stimulated genes, IFRD1, IRF1, and IFI6. In contrast, anti-inflammatory genes associated with CD14 ++ monocytes (M1) were downregulated in COVID-19 patients relative to that in the HCs (Fig. 3D, E) . Notably, IL1\u03b2 expression values in a UMAP with simultaneous contrast indicated that IL1\u03b2 was upregulated in the ERS group and decreased in the LRS patients (Fig. 3F) . This was also confirmed in the DC cluster of the ERS group compared to that of the HCs (Fig. S3A-B ). Next, we took the average of the inflammatory genes for each myeloid cell scRNA-seq subset in the COVID-19 patients versus that in the HCs (Fig. S3C) .\n\nThese results demonstrated that cytokine activation drives the expansion of monocyte populations (especially CD14 ++ inflammatory monocytes) in COVID-19-infected patients.

We observed enrichment of the pathways related to cytokine signaling and inflammation activation, which were driven by the upregulation of IFITM3 and IFI6 and IL1\u03b2, JUN, FOS, JUNB, and KLF6 (Fig. 3G) .\n\nCollectively, these findings demonstrate that a dysregulated balance in the monocyte populations in ERS patients is manifested by substantially increased classical CD14 ++ monocytes. Our results suggest that the classical CD14 ++ monocytes increase in circulation to fuel inflammation during SARS-CoV-2-infection.\n\nT and NK cells play critical roles in viral clearance during respiratory infections [15, 16] . Our clustering analysis sub-grouped T and NK lymphocytes into 10 subsets ( then, we sub-divided the NK cells into CD56 + CD16 -NK cells (NK1), which expressed high levels of CD56 and low levels of CD16, and C56 -CD16 + NK cells (NK2), which expressed high levels of CD16 and low levels of CD56. CD4 + T cells expressed CD3E and CD4; then, we sub-divided these cells into four clusters: na\u00efve CD4 + T cells (T1), which expressed high levels of CCR7, LEF1, and TCF7; central memory CD4 + T cells (T2, CD4 Tcm), which expressed high levels of CCR7, but more AQP3 and CD69 compared to na\u00efve CD4 + T cells; effector memory CD4 + T cells (T3, CD4 Tem), which expressed high levels of CCR6, CXCR6, CCL5, and PRDM1; and regulatory T cells (T4, Treg), which expressed FOXP3. CD8+ T cells expressed CD8A and CD8B and were sub-divided into three clusters: na\u00efve CD8 + T cells (T5), which expressed high levels of CCR7, LEF1, and TCF7, similar to na\u00efve CD4 + T cells; effector memory CD8 + T cells (T6, CD8 Tm), which expressed high levels of GZMK; and cytotoxic CD8 + lymphocytes (CD8 + CTL) (T7), which expressed high levels of GZMB, GNLY, and PRF1. Proliferating T cells (T8, Pro-T) were TYMS + MKI67 + cells.\n\nThe composition of the T and NK cell subsets differed significantly among the HCs and COVID-19 patients (Fig. 4C ). The ratio of CD8 + T cells decreased in the ERS COVID-19 patients, whereas the ratio of NK cells was higher than that in the HCs. The ratio of CD4 + T cells was stable, but the composition of the CD4 + T cell subset differed significantly between the HCs and COVID-19\n\npatients. Among CD4 + T cells, central memory CD4 + T cells were significantly higher, whereas the ratio of na\u00efve CD4 + T cells was lower than thats in the HCs. Notably, genes associated with CD4 + T All rights reserved.

CD4 + T cells had high expression levels of inflammatory genes, including FOS, JUN, KLF6, and S100A8 in patients in the ERS of COVID-19.\n\n( Fig. 4E ). In contrast, anti-inflammatory genes associated with CD4 + T cells were downregulated in COVID-19 patients relative to that in the HCs (Fig. 4D, E) . This suggested that CD4 + T cells were the main participants in the virus infection. Comparison of the DEGs in the CD4 + T cells revealed the enrichment of genes participating in the cytokine pathway and inflammation activation, including IFITM3 and IFI6 and IL1B, JUN, FOS, JUNB, and KLF6 (Fig. 4F ). Further studies are needed to elucidate the IFN pathways involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis.\n\nTCR-seq analysis showed that T cell expansion was obviously decreased in the ERS group than in the HC group (Fig. 4G ). Moreover, na\u00efve or central memory T cells showed little clonal expansion, while effector memory T cells, terminal effector CD8 + T cells (CTLs), and proliferating T cells showed higher expansion levels (Fig. 4H ). In addition, the most highly expanded (maximum) clone in the ERS group was TRAV8-6-TRAJ45:TRAV7-8-TRBJ2-1 (Fig. S5D ). The decreased ratio of CD8 + T cells in COVID-19 patients may implicate the role of CD8 + T cells in virus clearance (Fig.   4C ). Moreover, the CD8 + CTL with expanded clones also exhibited overactivated inflammation and antiviral activity compared to those in HCs ( Fig. 4I and Fig. S4B ). Together, these findings show that clonally expanded CD8 + T cells in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients help control the virus.\n\nWe also performed DEG analysis, via unsupervised clustering analysis, and found an overactivated inflammatory state in pro-T cells (Fig. S4C ). Next, we took the average of inflammatory genes for each NKT cell subset scRNA-seq subset in the COVID-19 patients versus normal RNA-seq data ( Fig.   S4D ). author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 23.20039362 doi: medRxiv preprint In comparison with that in the HCs, the percentage of plasma cells increased significantly in COVID-19 patients, whereas na\u00efve B cells decreased significantly in the COVID-19 patients (Fig.\n\ninfection and the development of adoptive immunity as they synergistically work and induce specific antibodies. Moreover, compared to that in the HCs, B cell activation-related genes, including S100A8, IGLL5, SSR3, IGHA1, XBP1, and MZB1 were primarily expressed in the MPB of the ERS group (Fig.   5D ). We also found similar results in the plasma cells, the antibody-secreting cells (ASC) ( (Fig. 5F ). Single-cell BCR-seq analysis indicated that the IgA isotype was over-represented in COVID-19 patients compared to that in the HC (Fig. 5G ). This corresponded with an increase in the levels of serum IgA, which was also pronounced in other coronavirus infections. Moreover, the ratio of (IgA+IgG+IgE) to (IgD+IgM) increased significantly in the ERS patients and showed a downward trend with recovery time (Fig.   5H ).\n\nUsing sc-BCR-seq to assess the status of clonal expansions in the blood of patients, we found that IL4R + na\u00efve B cells showed little clonal expansion, whereas CD27 + CD38 + memory B cells showed the highest expansion levels among diverse B cell subsets (Fig. 6A) . At the individual level, we found that COVID-19 patients had significantly expanded clones compared to that in the HCs, supporting the assumption that B cells had experienced unique clonal VDJ rearrangements under SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also found that a higher B cell clonality consistently remained in the ERS compared with that in the LRS patients (Fig. 6B) . Moreover, quantification of the most highly expanded (maximum) clone for each subject showed that the ratios of the maximum clones were higher in the ERS group than in the HCs (Fig. 6C) . To understand the functional status of expanded cloned B cells, we performed DEG analysis between the cloned memory B cells and the other B cells.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Moreover, the differential genes for expanded B cells significantly subsided over time and reduced in LRS patients (Fig. 6D) .\n\nTo study the unique changes and preference genes of BCR in COVID-19 patients, we compared the usage of VDJ genes in COVID-19 patients with that in the HCs. We identified an over-representation of the IGHV3 family, especially the IGHV3-7, IGHV3-15, IGHV3-21, IGHV3-23, and IGHV3-30 in COVID-19 patients compared to that in the HCs (Fig. 6E) . The preferred IGLVs were IGKV1-17, IGKV2-28, and IGKV3-15, whereas the preferred IGKVs were IGLV1-44, IGLV2-8, and IGLV3-27 6E) . Moreover, the top two pairing frequencies in ERS patients were IGHV3-23-IGHJ4 and IGHV3-7-IGHJ6 (Fig. 6F) . These cells showed IGH subunit pairing with the IGL/V subunit encoded by IGLV1-44-IGLJ3 and IGKV1-17-IGKJ1, respectively, which indicated expanded states associated with SARS-CoV-2 specificity. Individually, ERS-4 and ERS-5 had the maximum clones, referring to IGHV3-23-IGHJ4 (Fig. S5E ) and IGHV3-7-IGHJ6 (Fig. S5F) , respectively.\n\nIn summary, an increase in clonality in COVID-19, which was dominated by the IgA and IgM isotypes, together with a skewed use of the IGHV gene, suggested the contribution of SARS-CoV-2 to pathogenesis. Notably, the biased usage of dominated IGV genes, especially the IGHV3-23 and IGHV3-7 in COVID-19 patients, provides a framework for the rational design of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.\n\nAn established computational approach [17] was used to predict cell-to-cell interactions that may contribute to the distinct functional state of T cells, B cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells (DCs) in ERS and LRS (Fig. 7A, B) . In ERS COVID-19 patients, we found adaptive signals involved in monocyte activation, proliferation, and inflammatory signaling (Fig. 7A, B) . T cells expressed genes encoding ligands of TNFSF8, LTA, IFNG, IL17A, CCR5, and LTB to TNFRSF8, TNFRSF1A/TNFRSF14, IFNGR1, IL-17RA, CCR1, and LTBR, which were expressed on monocytes and could contribute to the pro-inflammatory status. Other T cell-monocyte interactions involved the expression of CSF2 and CSF1. T cells might activate monocytes through the expression of CSF2 and CSF1, which bind to CSFRs (CSFR2/1) and contribute to inflammatory storm. A cluster All rights reserved.

T cell-monocyte interaction may enhance immune response and be exclusive to COVID-19 patients. (Fig. 7A, B) . Furthermore, we found that monocytes highly expressed the poliovirus receptor, which serves as a cellular receptor for poliovirus in the first step of poliovirus replication and induction of the NF-kappa B signaling pathway. From the B cell-monocyte and B cell-T cell interactions, we found that B cells could secrete a large number of IL-6, LTA, and LTB, which are combined with IL-6R, LTAR, and LTBR expressed in monocytes, and a large amount of IL-6 was applied to T cells to promote the secretion of IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, and other inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Thus, a cascade signature of inflammatory monocytes with high expression of IL-6 and their progeny were formed in the peak incidence of ERS COVID-19 patients (Fig. 7C) . These activated immune cells may enter the circulation in the lung and other organs in large numbers and play an immune-damaging role. In LRS COVID-19 patients, DC ligands were predicted to interact with B and T cell receptors involved in cell proliferation and the production of antibodies. We discovered that the peripheral blood of LRS patients contains a diversity of antibodies ;   we  found  that  IL18-IL18RAP,  TNFSF13-TNFRSF13B,  TNFSF13-TNFRSF17,   TNFSF13B-TNFRSF17, TNFSF13B-TNFRSF13B , and TNFSF13B-TNFRSF13C were highly expressed in our analysis of DC-B cell interaction (Fig. 7D) . Thus, we speculate that DCs produce IL-18, TNFSF13, and TNFSF13B to promote the proliferation of B cells and then secrete many antibodies into the blood in ERS. From the DC-T and T cell-B cell interactions, we discovered that DCs produce not only IL-18 but also IL-7 to promote the proliferation of T cells; moreover, T cells produce IL-2 (to promote the proliferation of B cells) and antibodies (Fig. 7D) . Thus, cell-to-cell interactions help us to understand why COVID-19 patients manifested high rates of monocytes and low rates of lymphocytes and why the proportion of lymphocytes gradually increased in the peripheral blood of recovering patients.\n\nAll rights reserved.

This has been similarly observed in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and influenza infections [12, 14] . In viral infection, it is generally accepted that host immune responses determine both protection against viral infections and the pathogenesis of respiratory injury [18, 19] . A coordinated response in innate and adaptive immune cells working in concert may lead to the rapid control of the virus, whereas a failed immune response might lead to viral spreading, cytokine storm, and a high mortality rate [20] . Despite belonging to same group of viruses, recent studies have highlighted differences between COVID-19, SARS, and MERS, such as the speed of transmission, treatment scheme, and mortality rate. Moreover, this difference may also exist in the key immune players and the underlying molecular mechanisms related to these diseases. The lack of knowledge regarding the immune impact of COVID-19 has now become a critical issue in view of its rapid spread and the shortage of specific therapy [21] . Using single-cell sequencing, we profiled the complexity of immune populations in the blood and analyzed 70,858 cells from 10 patients. We identified a hyper-inflammatory response in ERS patients, which may explain why some patients fell sick after being discharged, and suggest that the current criteria for hospital discharge should be re-evaluated. In addition, we identified unique signatures of myeloid, NKT, and B cells and pinpointed the changes in the epitopes of TCR and BCR.\n\nOur findings helped elucidate the antiviral immune mechanisms and revealed promising opportunities for developing immunotherapies using vaccines and neutralizing antibodies.\n\nInflammation is a vital part of the immune system's response to COVID-19 invasion; previous and latest studies have reported significantly higher levels of inflammatory cytokines associated with disease severity in SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 patients [22, 23] . Among the various inflammatory cells, monocytes and their subsets (including classical, intermediate, and non-classical monocytes) may play a critical role because they are known to fuel inflammation [24] [25] [26] [27] . In our study, compared with the HCs, ERS patients demonstrated a significantly higher ratio of monocytes, and these cells expressed higher levels of inflammatory genes. Intriguingly, the ratio of classical CD14 + monocytes was high in ERS but remained normal in LRS. Furthermore, CD14 + IL1\u03b2 monocytes, which were absent in HCs, could be observed in ERS, and they declined in number in LRS. Notably, our cell-to-cell interaction analysis indicated that IL1\u03b2, CSF1, IL6, and CSF2 may be associated with All rights reserved.

Collectively, our data provide important insights into the role of monocytes in the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19. The adaptive immune system harbors the ability to recognize and remember specific pathogens through antibody and T cell responses [28] . Inducing adaptive immunity is the aim of vaccination [29] .\n\nPrevious SARS studies have identified binding and neutralizing antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV infection. Their therapeutic effect is unclear [30] , although robust antibody responses could be induced [31] . In COVID-19 infection, although several lines of evidence have consistently indicated a decline in lymphocyte counts, the distinct immune characteristics at single-cell resolution are unclear. Our scRNA-seq analysis showed that, compared with the HCs, ERS patients have a lower ratio of T and NK cells, and these patients' T cells express higher levels of inflammatory genes, such as JUN, FOS, JUNB, and KLF6. In addition, high-throughput TCR sequencing identified expanded T cell clones in ERS patients. In LRS patients, the immunophenotype was different. In particular, LRS patients would have an increase in T and NK cells, with a lower expression of inflammatory genes. We also performed a detailed analysis of B cells in patients and identified a higher population of plasma cells than that in the HCs. We found that BCR contained highly expanded clones, indicating their SARS-CoV-2 specificity. Importantly, we found several loci unique to COVID-19 infection. The strongest pairing frequencies, IGHV3-23-IGHJ4, indicated a monoclonal state associated with SARS-CoV-2 specificity. Notably, numerous studies have reported biased usage of VDJ genes related to virus-specific antibodies. For example, IGHV3-30 and IGKV3-11 have been involved in encoding primary antibodies to neutralize human cytomegalovirus [32, 33] . In addition, IGHV3-30 and IGHV3-21 have been utilized to isolate influenza virus antibodies and used for the production of virus vaccines [34, 35] . Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that antibodies combining the IGHV3-15/IGLV1-40 segments had superior neutralizing activities against the Zaire Ebola virus [36] .\n\nIn addition, we observed lower expression of inflammatory genes in ERS patients than in the HCs.\n\nWe envision that our results will provide direction for the development of vaccines and antibodies for COVID-19 patients.\n\nOur cell-to-cell prediction analysis utilizing scRNA-seq data indicated that, in ERS patients, B cell-derived IL-6, T cell-derived CSF1 (M-CSF), and CSF2 (GM-CSF) may promote monocyte proliferation and activation. As a result, monocytes may produce a larger number of inflammatory All rights reserved.

In LRS patients, both DCs-derived TNFSF13 and IL-18 and T cell-derived IL-2, IL-4 may promote B cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. Consequently, B cells produce numerous SARS-COV-2-specific antibodies to clear viruses.\n\nIn conclusion, our study provides the first immune atlas of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and identifies adaptive immune dysregulation after discharge. The clonal expansion of both T and B cells indicates that the immune system has gradually recovered; however, the sustained hyper-inflammatory response for more than 7 days after discharge suggests the need for medical observation after patients are discharged from hospital. Longitudinal studies of recovered patients in a larger cohort might help to understand the consequences of the disease. The novel BCRs identified in our study may advance our understanding of B cell mechanisms and have potential clinical utility in COVID-19 immunotherapies.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Using barcode information, T/B cells with prevalent TCR/BCR clonotypes were projected on a t-SNE plot.\n\nThe cell-cell interaction analysis was based on the expression of immune-related receptors and ligands. The gene list contained 135 pairs of well-annotated receptors and ligands, including cytokines, chemokines and co-stimulators. We estimated the potential interaction between two cell types mediated by a specific ligand-receptor pair by the product of the average expression levels of the ligand in one cell type and the corresponding receptor in the other cell type.\n\nAll rights reserved.
