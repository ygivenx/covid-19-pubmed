{"title": "", "body": "Severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly develop acute respiratory distress leading to respiratory failure, with high short-term mortality rates. At present, there is no reliable risk stratification tool for non-severe COVID-19 patients at admission. We aimed to construct an effective model for early identifying cases at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19.\n\nChina were included retrospectively. All patients with non-severe COVID-19 during hospitalization were followed for more than 15 days after admission. Patients who deteriorated to severe or critical COVID-19 and patients who kept non-severe state were assigned to the severe and non-severe group, respectively. We compared the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data between severe and non-severe group. Based on baseline data, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm and logistic regression model were used to construct a nomogram for risk prediction in the train cohort. The predictive accuracy and discriminative ability of nomogram were evaluated by area under the curve (AUC) and calibration curve.\n\nDecision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curve analysis (CICA) were conducted to evaluate the clinical applicability of our nomogram. diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic respiratory disease, tuberculosis disease. We found one demographic and six serological indicators (age, serum lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, the coefficient of variation of red blood cell distribution width (RDW), blood urea nitrogen, albumin, direct bilirubin) are associated with severe COVID-19. Based on these features, we generated the nomogram, which has remarkably high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing individuals who exacerbated to severe COVID-19 from non-severe COVID-19 ( \n\nOur nomogram could help clinicians to early identify patients who will exacerbate to severe COVID-19. And this risk stratification tool will enable better centralized management and early treatment of severe patients, and optimal use of medical resources via patient prioritization and thus significantly reduce mortality rates. The RDW plays an important role in predicting severe COVID-19, implying that the role of RBC in severe disease is underestimated.\n\nSince the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in December 2019, the number of reported cases has surpassed 120,000 with over 4600 deaths worldwide, as of March 12 2020.\n\nThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a member of coronaviruses known to cause common colds and severe illnesses such as , is the cause of COVID-19 1 . Compared with much higher overall case-fatality rates (CFR) for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 is being responsible for more total deaths because of the increased transmission speed and the growing numbers of cases 2 . Up to now, the World Health Organization (WHO) has raised global Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) outbreak risk to \"Very High\", and SARS-CoV-2 infection has become a serious threat to public health.\n\nAccording to a report recently released by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that included approximately 44,500 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections, up to 15.8% were severe or critical. Most COVID-19 patients have a mild disease course, while some patients experience rapid deterioration (particularly within 7-14 days) from onset of symptoms into severe COVID-19 with or without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 3 .\n\nCurrent epidemiological data suggests that the mortality rate of severe COVID-19 patients is about 20 times higher than that of non-severe COVID-19 patients 4, 5 . This situation highlights the need to identify COVID-19 patients at risk of approaching to severe COVID-19. These severe illness patients often require utilization of intensive medical resources. Therefore, early identification of patients at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19 will facilitate appropriate supportive care and reduce the mortality rate, unnecessary or inappropriate healthcare utilization via patient prioritization.\n\nAt present, an early warning model for predicting COVID-19 patients at-risk of developing a costly condition is scarce 3, 6 . So far, prognosis factors of COVID-19 mainly focus on the immune cells. In our study, we found that older age, higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein (CRP), RDW (the coefficient of variation of red blood cell distribution width), DBIL (direct bilirubin), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and lower albumin (ALB) on admission correlated with higher odds of severe COVID-19. Based on these indexes, we developed and validated an effective prognostic nomogram with high sensitivity and specificity for accurate individualized assessment of the incidence of severe COVID-19. Among these indexes, the prognostic role of RDW in COVID-19 is underestimated, which is associated with the increased turnover of erythrocytes. Our results hinted that the turnover of RBC might involve in severe illness.\n\nData on COVID-19 inpatients between January 20 th 2020 and March 2 nd 2020 was retrospectively collected from three clincial centers: Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. A total of 372 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled, 9 patients younger than 15 years of age were excluded from the study. Clinical laboratory test results, including SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection results, biochemical indices, blood routine results, were collected from routine clinical practice.

[16] . Little's MCAR test (R package BaylorEdPsych) was used to assess the suitability of the remaining missing values for imputation. This test is used to test whether missing values are \"missing completely at random\" (MCAR) or biased. The missing values were imputed by expectation-maximization (EM) method using SPSS statistical software, version 25 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).\n\nTo identify the relative importance of each feature, feature selection was performed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression method, and prediction models were built using logistic regression, decision tree, random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) using R package Caret, using 300-time repeated random sub-sampling validation for diverse parameter conditions, respectively. As described previously, Nomograms were established with the rms package and the performance of nomogram was evaluated by discrimination (Harrell's concordance index) and calibration (calibration plots and Hosmer-Lemeshow calibration test) in R. During the external validation of the nomogram, the total points for each patient in the validation cohort were calculated based on the established nomogram.\n\nThe selection of the study population is illustrated in Figure 1 . A total of 372 COVID-19 patients were enrolled after admission from three centers in Guangzhou and Wuhan (Figure 1 ). All patients with non-severe COVID-19 during hospitalization were followed for more than 15 days after admission. Patients who deteriorated to severe or critical COVID-19 and patients who kept non-severe state were assigned to the severe and non-severe group, respectively. There were no All rights reserved.

In the train cohort, the non-severe COVID-19 group consisted of 159 (86.41%) patients, with a median age of 45 years of age (range 33-61 years) while 25 patients (13.59%), with a median age of 64 years of age (range 55-72 years) progressed to severe COVID-19.

There were no big difference in performance of these models except for decision tree. Therefore, logistic regression model was used for further analysis owing to its high predictive power and interpretability.\n\nThe predictive nomogram that integrated 7 selected features for the incidence of severe COVID-19 in the train cohort is shown ( Figure 2C ). To evaluate clinical applicability of our risk prediction nomogram, decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curve analysis (CICA) were performed.

In Figure 3A and 3B, the calibration plot for severe illness probability showed a good agreement between the prediction by nomogram and actual observation in the train cohort and validation cohort 1, respectively.\n\nIn the train cohort, the nomogram had a significantly high AUC 0.912 (95% CI 0.846-0.978) to discriminate individuals with severe COVID-19 from non-severe COVID-19, with a sensitivity of 85.71 % and specificity of 87.58% ( Figure 3C , Table 2 ). Cutpoint R package was used to calculate optimal cutpoints by bootstraping the variability of the optimal cutpoints, which was 188.6358 for our nomogram (corresponding to a threshold probability of 0.190). Then patients in the validation cohorts were divided into the low group (score \u2264 188.6358) and the high group (score>188.6358) for further analysis. In consistent with the train cohort, in validation cohort 1, AUC was 0.853 for patients with severe COVID-19 versus non-severe COVID-19 with a sensitivity of 77.5 % and specificity of 78.4% ( Figure 3D , Table 3 ). In validation cohort 2, the sensitivity and the specificity of the nomogram were observed to be 75% and 100%, respectively.\n\nEarly identification of patients approaching to severe COVID-19 patients will lead to better management and optimal use of medical resources. In this research, we identified older age, higher LDH and CRP, DBIL, RDW, BUN, and lower ALB on admission correlated with higher odds of severe COVID-19. Furthermore, we developed an effective prognostic nomogram composed of 7 features, had significantly high sensitivity and specificity to distinguish individuals with severe COVID-19 from non-severe COVID-19.

Furthermore, only seven easy-access features were included in our nomogram, including older age, higher LDH and CRP, DBIL, RDW, BUN, and lower ALB. Among of them, age, NLR and LDH has been reported to be risk factors for severe patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection 3, 6, 7 .\n\nNLR, a widely used marker for the assessment of system inflammation, was not identified by LASSO as an important feature instead of LDH and CRP, which are associated with the systemic inflammatory response 8 . However, LDH could predict severity of tissue damage in early stage of diseases as an auxiliary marker 9 . These might be reasons why the lasso model did not identified NLR as a more important feature. Consistent with other reports, our results indicate that patients All rights reserved.

RDW, one of the numbers or blood cell indices, reflects the variation in the size of RBC (red blood cells), which has been tightly correlated with critical disease 10-12 but negligent in COVID-19. It is a robust predictor of the risk of all cause patient mortality and bloodstream infection in the critically ill [11] [12] [13] [14] , including acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia, ARDS 10, 15 . RDW also can predict prognosis of sepsis, which was tied to poor COVID-19\n\noutcomes-death 16 .\n\nThe increased RDW in COVID-19 patients may be due to the increased turnover of erythrocytes: 1) Pro-inflammatory states may be responsible for insufficient erythropoiesis with structural and functional alteration of RBC, such as decreased deformability leading to more rapid clearing of RBC. 2) Plasma cytokines such as interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) could not only attenuate the renal erythropoietin (EPO) production, but also blunt the erythroid progenitor response to EPO. In addition, INF-\u03b3 contributes to apoptosis of the erythroid progenitors and decrease the EPO receptor expression 17 . 3) RBC are dynamic reservoirs of cytokines 18 . Decreased deformability of RBC in severe illness leads to RBC lysis and release of intracellular contents into the circulation 19 , including some inflammatory cytokines. This positive feedback could greatly promote the apparent shortened RBC survival and ultimately more morphological variations in cell sizes (i.e., elevated RDW), increased inflammatory response, and lead to severe illness. RDW can be regarded as an index of enhanced patient fragility and higher vulnerability to adverse outcomes 20 . The elevated RDW may explain fatigue experienced by All rights reserved.

Second, to guarantee the robustness of the conclusion, we included the data from three centers with a large sample size and validation in independent cohorts. The performance of our nomogram was efficient for clinical practice.\n\nThere were some limitations in the study. First, this is a retrospective study, including 372 patients with non-severe COVID-19 on admission. Second, some patients are still in hospital and their condition may change with follow-up. More comprehensive investigations need to be conducted to explain the characteric of the 7 features.\n\nIn summary, our data suggest that our nomogram could early identify the severe COVID-19 patients, and RDW was vaulable for prediction of severe diseases. Our nomogram is especially valuable for risk stratification management, which will be helpful for alleviating insufficient medical resources and reducing mortality.\n\nThis work is funded by the Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, China (201804010474).\n\nCompeting interests: All authors have completed the ICMJE uniform disclosure form at www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf and declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037515 doi: medRxiv preprint author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
