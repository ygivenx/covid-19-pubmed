{"title": "CASE STUDY", "body": "of the company. Secondly, a programme of courses was implemented -'Putting People First'throughout the whole company.\n\nThese moves resulted in a complete revue of the management structure with 60 of the top 100 managers leaving the company. The overall age profile of the management team was reduced and these managers were chosen for their entrepreneurial abilities.\n\nThe cultural revolution of the company was underway with the aim ultimately, of putting the customer first.\n\nThis changing philosophy of the company was underpinned by an extensive programme of marketing research which started the process towards a campaign aimed at improving standards of service. This programme of marketing research looked at customer attitudes and experiences.\n\nThe research focused on the following elements:\n\n\u2022 customer service standards monitor;\n\n\u2022 regular business traveller survey; \u2022 advertising and image monitor;\n\n\u2022 requirements for services, change, and enhancement by a well-defined product development programme.\n\nThe results of the research were communicated to all staff, even though much of the data demanded a strategic rather than a tactical response. The post-privatization policy of British Airways has been well documented by laws. The policy involved the creation of a clear mission statement, clear corporate objectives, and corporate goals. These are shown in Exhibit 1.1.\n\nThe mission, objectives, and goals quoted in Exhibit 1.1 demonstrate the change from a product orientation to a market orientation, including concentration on customers, markets, and competitors. The success of the company, at that time, can be attributed to a series of factors which are shown in Exhibit 1.2.\n\nA major aspect of the airline's success was its promotional strategy, some highlights of which are shown in Exhibit 1.3. These, together with the airline's slogan 'the world's favourite airline' created a high profile, positive image for the airline.\n\nBy the early 1990s, British Airways was in such a strong position that it could survive the effects of the Gulf War and remain profitable.\n\nBritish Airways was an early advocate of de-regulation in the European civil aviation market, following which had happened in the 1980s in the USA. Confident of its own strengths, British Airways felt it would flourish in a de-regulated business environment in competition with inefficient state-owned airlines.\n\nWhen de-regulation began to be introduced in the European Union in the early 1990s, British Airways was quick to take advantage of the situation. It invested in airlines in other European countries, notably the creation of Deutsche BA in Germany and its purchase of TAT (Touraine Air Transport) in France.\n\nThe airline appeared to be flourishing in this increasingly de-regulated European airspace. However, the new, so-called budget 'no frills' airlines emerged in the de-regulated environment such as easyJet and Ryanair offering low fares. These airlines began to attack British Airways on some of its European routes.\n\nThe airline retaliated in 1997 by launching its own budget airline, 'Go' to exploit the new market. However, critics suggested its real motive was to try to attack, and eventually squeeze out, the independent budget airlines.\n\nBritish Airways has always been a strong supporter of the process of globalization and has done all it can to exploit this trend to become a truly global airline.\n\n1. The BA mission -to 1990 and beyond \u2022 BA will have a corporate charisma such that everyone working for it will take pride in the company and see themselves as representing a highly successful worldwide organization. \u2022 BA will be a creative enterprise, caring about its people and its customers. \u2022 BA will develop the kind of business capability which will make BA the envy of its competitors, to the enhancement of its stakeholders. \u2022 BA will be a formidable contender in all the fields it enters, as well as demonstrating a resourceful and flexible ability to earn high profits wherever it chooses to focus. \u2022 Whether in transport or in any of the travel or tourism activity areas, the term 'BA' will be the ultimate symbol of creativity, value, service, and quality.\n\nThe paramount objective is profitability, underpinned by subsidiary objectives:\n\n\u2022 To match at least the annual average growth of the total world airline market.\n\n\u2022 To achieve standards of performance at least as high as the best of our competitors.\n\n\u2022 To serve existing routes and markets, to identify new opportunities for branded services and products, and to ensure BA's freedom to compete in world markets; all being undertaken in such a manner as to meet the paramount and subsidiary objectives. \u2022 To attract, develop and retain sufficient well-trained staff with the skills to meet customer expectations. \u2022 To be more efficient than relevant competitors in the market places we choose to operate. \u2022 To provide a continuity of service from the initial point of customer contact through to the completion of the service.\n\nThe corporate goal in British Airways is to be the best airline in the world. To achieve this goal, the corporate objectives are:\n\n\u2022 To provide the highest levels of service to all customers, passengers, shippers, travel agents, and freight agents. \u2022 To preserve high professional and technical standards in order to achieve the highest levels of safety. \u2022 To provide a uniform image worldwide and to maintain a specific set of standards for each clearly defined market segment. \u2022 To respond quickly and sensitively to the changing needs of present and potential customers. \u2022 To maintain and, where opportunity occurs, expand the present route structure. \u2022 To manage, operate, and market the airline in the most efficient manner. \u2022 To create a service and people-oriented work environment, assuring all employees of fair pay and working conditions, and continuing concern for their careers.\n\nIn addition it:\n\n\u2022 bought shares in foreign airlines such as Qantas in Australia;\n\n\u2022 encouraged the development of the first major global strategic airline alliance, the 'One World Alliance' in 1998; \u2022 became involved in franchising to extend its coverage through deals with airlines such as Maersk Air UK and GB Airways.\n\nOther schemes were proposed which eventually did not come to anything such as the planned Air Russia with partners in Russia. British Airways also tried to spread its influence through the purchase of the Air Miles Travel Promotion Company.\n\nIn 1996 an alliance was formed with American Airlines which it was hoped would eventually lead to a merger between the two companies.\n\nThe height of the airline's drive for global status came in 1997 when it unveiled its new brand identity. In keeping with its ambitions to be seen as a global airline the airline removed the 'Union Jack' flag from its aircraft tails and replaced them with artwork from the countries which British Airways served. It wanted to be seen as a world airline not associated with any particular country. This re-branding cost hundreds of millions of pounds.\n\n\u2022 Change in management personnel and recruitment of strong leaders into the business. \u2022 Emphasis on marketing philosophy, customer service, and performance related pay. \u2022 Creation of a clearly defined marketing department. \u2022 Reductions in costs in the business achieved by savage labour cuts, slimming down of the business, and concentration on key strategic business areas. \u2022 Clearly defined segmentation policies and targeting of these in well developed branding programmes. Source: Campaign 1993 Campaign -2002 By the late 1990s, it appeared that British Airways had truly become 'the world's favourite airline'. It had:\n\n\u2022 achieved a situation where it was very profitable by airline industry standards. For example, in 1996 For example, in -1997 , it achieved a profit of UK \u00a3640 million, namely 8 per cent of turnover; \u2022 a stable structure and management team; \u2022 developed a global coverage through its acquisitions, franchises, and strategic alliances; \u2022 been recognized as a leading share in the UK stock market; \u2022 achieved good levels of service and customer satisfaction.\n\nHowever, since then things have not gone well for British Airways, in general. By 1999-2000 its profit had fallen to just UK \u00a35 million, just 0.06 per cent of turnover. In the early years of the new millennium it had even experienced financial losses.\n\nLet us now look at how this transformation in the fortunes of this company took place, dividing the reasons into external and internal factors.\n\nSince the late 1990s, British Airways has had to contend with a number of problems in its external business environment, notably:\n\n1. economic downturns which have depressed demand, from the economic crisis in south-east Asia in the late 1990s to the current (2002-2003 economic slowdown affecting the USA; 2. the huge decline in Trans-Atlantic traffic -a previously very profitable sector -due to the effects of the terrorist attacks in the USA on 11 September 2001; 3. the continuing fear of terrorist attacks which have reduced demand for air travel all over the world, following the attacks in 2002 in Bali and Kenya; 4. the war with Iraq, which is going on at the time of writing which has also made people fearful of travelling; 5. in Spring 2003, the 'severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)' virus has created fear of travel to parts of south-east Asia and has affected traffic levels in these important routes for British Airways; 6. the problems given by deep vein thrombosis (DVT) had discouraged some people from taking long-haul flights, a major source of revenue for British Airways; 7. the continued growth of the budget airlines in Europe has affected both leisure and business travel demand on the airline's short-haul routes; 8. the economic downturn in the airline sector has led to price-cutting which has not helped the profitability of British Airways; 9. the political instability has increased airline costs through the rising price of fuel; 10. greater airport security in the light of the terrorist attacks has made passenger management more complex and has forced fares up due to the introduction of airport security taxes.\n\nIt is clear to see that the environment in which British Airways operates has been quite disastrous in recent years. A weaker airline may not have survived it; indeed many European and US airlines are operating close to bankruptcy or are technically bankrupt. However, it has to be said that British Airways has also made mistakes that have cost it dearly. These mistakes of judgement have assumed greater significance due to the appalling state of the business environment. Let us now look at some of these issues.\n\nBritish Airways is still a major global airline but its reputation has declined significantly since the heyday of its success in the mid-1990s. Some of this decline is due to some inappropriate management decisions, but much of it reflects the very difficult business environment for all airlines in recent years. It is ironic that as British Airways has declined, easyJet, always a critic of British Airways, has thrived."}
