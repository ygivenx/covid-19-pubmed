{"title": "STUDIES ALPHA-HYBRID ON THE SUITABILITY OF INTERFERON APPLICATION IN CATTLE", "body": "After detection and first application of interferon (IFN) an IFN-rush started. IFN was almost considered as a panacea. Viral agents were the initiators that stimulated the various cells to produce IFN. In cattle the virus inducing the highest titers in mucous membranes of the respiratory and genital tracts was BHVI [1] , and a highly passaged avirulent strain of BHV1 [2] was for many years successfully used as a paramunity inducer to minimize the effects of crowding disease and treating bovine vaginitis [3] . These findings were later confirmed and it was shown that a ts-mutant of BHV1 also induces IFN production [4] . Differences in IFN induction in the respiratory tract of calves by three different parainfluenza-3-vaccines were described later [5] . IFN activity in the intestinal tract induced by rotavirus was also demonstrated 240 Otto Christian Straub [6] . Subsequently various synthetic, cell culture or bacteria derived alpha-IFNs were developed and first tested in ritro [7 11 ] with positive results. However, when the IFNs were tested in t, ivo different results were reported. A distinct protective effect was not achieved with transmissible gastroenteritis virus in newborn pigs [10] and also not with paranfluenza-3-virus in cattle [12] . Positive results were obtained in treating cattle prophylactically against BHVI [13] , bovine virus diarrhoea virus disease [14] and vaccinia virus infection [15] and for therapeutic reasons in rota and corona virus infections [16] . An effect on the course of a foot-and-mouth disease virus infection was also described [2] .\n\nThe object of this study was to examine the effects of different doses and modes of administration of an E. coli derived alpha-hybrid IFN which had been tested previously in tissue cultures and orally in calves suffering from digestive tract disorders [16] .\n\nThe alpha-hybrid-IFN (ahIFN) was an E. coli derived purified, antibody free, slightly modified lymphoblastoid interferon with a specific activity of 3 x 108 units per ml, developed and provided by Hoechst AG, Frankfurt.\n\nTwelve cattle with body weights ranging from 100 to 250 kg were parenterally or orally treated with various doses of ahlFN as summarized in Table 1 .\n\nThe white blood cell picture of all animals was determined before administration of ahIFN, together with body temperature, pulse and respiration rates. They were repeated immediately after the administrations and at hourly intervals, in general until 9 h later. The white blood cell count was also determined at intervals indicated in Tables 2 and 3 .\n\nAfter the intravenous administration there was no increase in animals with the low dose (Nos. 401 and 402, Table 1 ), but the higher doses produced a distinct elevation, with the maximum being reached between the 3rd and 6th hour (40.8'C). Following consecutive treatments, the increases were less marked. Only one animal (No. 435, Table 1 ) reached 40.8C during the 5th hour. No difference was observed between i.v., i.m. and s.c. administrations. Orally administered ahIFN did not produce any changes.\n\nA marked rise was only observed in those animals which received the highest dose (Nos. 435 and 436, Table 1 ) coinciding with the rise in temperature. The same response occurred on the following days with no reaction in the animals treated orally.\n\nOnly the lowest dose and the orally treated animals failed to exhibit a distinct rise, but all the others reacted with a marked increase. Animal No. 427 started, for example, with a rate of 32/min and reached 106 after 2 h and No. 436 started with a rate of 30/min which Alpha-hybrid interferon Tables 2 and 3 .\n\nThese were observed in the 2 animals (Nos. 435 and 436, Table 1 ), which received the highest dose. In summary, No. 435, increased serious nasal discharge 3 h after the first injection, still present on day 2, but with laboured breathing and anorexia 2 h later. Increased salivation 1 h after the third treatment.

Hofmann et al. [16] used approximately the same dose for the treatment of digestive disorders in calves. It seems most likely therefore that the positive results can be attributed to the treatment, since this could substantiate the efficacy of ahIFN treatment in vitro and in vivo with rota-and coronaviruses. However, higher doses certainly do more harm than good, and not only for short periods of time as judged by the clinical signs, but for long periods of time, as is evident from the changes in the white blood picture. The route of parenteral administration does not seem to be relevant. The same is obviously true for the body weight resp. age. The results are in general agreement with those obtained by Gitlespie and coworkers [17] .\n\nIt is not unexpected that IFN administration does not influence PI3-virus infections [12] , as PI3-virus induces IFN activity [5] . The same is true for BHVI [1] . Therefore, there is no justification to administer IFN prior to BHV1 exposure [13] . The results are encouraging concerning BVDV infections [14] . If IFN acts as an immunostimulant [13] , it could be used to improve the immune response, especially following the vaccination with inactivated BVDV vaccines."}
