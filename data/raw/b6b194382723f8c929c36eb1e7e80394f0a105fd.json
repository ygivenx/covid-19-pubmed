{"title": "Population Responses during the Pandemic Phase of the Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 Epidemic", "body": "The gender/age distributions were comparable to those of the recent census data (% female = 46.0%; % 40-60 = 51.5%).\n\nProportion of female participants was higher among the respondents than among the non-responders (57.9% versus 45.4%, p < 0.01).\n\nNo significant between-group differences were found for other socio-demographic characteristics (p > 0.05; Table 1 ).\n\nOver time, >85% of the participants used a face mask and immediately visited a doctor when experiencing influenza-like symptoms. More than 50% of the participants washed their hands >10 times every day throughout the survey period (p>0.05). As the pandemic progressed, a decreasing percentage of participants wore masks in public areas; avoided touching their mouth, nose, and eyes; took anti-influenza drugs; avoided crowded places; and took Traditional Chinese medicine to prevent virus infection (p<0.01) ( Table 2) .\n\nFewer participants worried about themselves (from 12.3% in Round 1 to 2.4% in Round 7, p < 0.001) or their family members (from 15.3% in Round 1 to 2.4% in Round 7, p < 0.001) contracting H1N1, while more participants believed that \"it does not matter if I contracted H1N1' (from 41.4% in Round 1 to 50.7% in Round 7, p<.001) . Fewer participants were in panic, feeling much depressed or felt emotionally disturbed due to H1N1, the prevalence at Round 7 became <1% for these three individual items. Percentage of participants expressing any type of mental distress (feeling panic/depressed/emotionally disturbed about H1N1) also significantly decreased from Round 1 to 7 (from 16.3% to 2.8%. p<.001) ( Table 3) .\n\nOver time, a decreasing percentage of participants recognized that touching infected persons and touching contaminated objects could transmit H1N1 (p < 0.001). Throughout the whole study period, a consistently high percentage of participants (>92%) recognized that H1N1 could be transmitted through droplets. Misconceptions about possible transmissions of H1N1 via insect bites (26.1%) and water sources (34.5%) were prevalent throughout the study period (Table 4 ).\n\nOver time, fewer participants had mistaken that fatality rate of H1N1 was \u22651% (Round 1:31.4% to Round 7: 24.8%, such percentage peaked at Round 5: 47.6%) ( Table 5 ).\n\nFewer participants perceived a chance of having a large-scale local outbreak in the coming year (from 41.4% in Round 1 to 3.4% in Round 7, Table 6 , p < 0.001). Similar percentages of respondents were confident in keeping themselves and their family free from H1N1 over time (over 70% at all rounds and peaking at Round 7: 92.3%, Table 6 ). Nevertheless, the prevalence of perceived susceptibility in contracting H1N1 fluctuated over time, in terms of susceptibility for oneself (Round 1:16.6% to Round 7: 2.6%), one's family (Round 1: 14.9% to Round 7: 2.6%) and the general public (Round 1: 20.9% to Round 7: 2.6%) ( Table 6 ).\n\nA consistently high percentage (>90%) of the participants believed that using face masks in public areas, washing hands frequently, and avoiding crowded places could effectively prevent the spread of H1N1 (p > 0.05) ( Table 7) .\n\nLess than 10% of the participants at all rounds believed that the Hong Kong government overreacted to the H1N1 pandemic (p > 0.05; Table 8 ). Less than 5% of the participants at Rounds 2-6 believed that the government should cancel all control measures for controlling the H1N1 pandemic, but the percentage peaked at Round 7 (15.6%; Table 9 ). During Round 2 through 7, more participants believed in government's ability to control the H1N1 pandemic (from 77.1% in Round 1 to 94.9% in Round 7, p < 0.001; Table 9 ), while a sizable proportion of participants believed that the government should treat H1N1 in the same manner as seasonal flu fluctuated (R1: 53.1%, R5: 38.9%, R7: 54.4%, p < 0.001) ( Table 9 ).\n\nOur participants had in general higher levels of knowledge (e.g., >92% recognizing transmission via droplets) and practice of preventive measures, as compared to general populations of other countries. For instance, only three-fourth of general population in China knew that H1N1 could be transmitted by droplets; less than 10% of the military men in Singapore were aware that influenza can be spread by touch (8) ; less than 25% of Indians and 50% of Australians believed that handwashing was effective in preventing H1N1; only one-fourth of general population in the Netherlands regarded wearing facemasks as an effective preventive measure and only 38% used preventive measures (9); only 6.5% of Korean college students reported washing their hands more than 10 times every day during the pandemic period.\n\nSimilarly, a study conducted in October 2009 showed that over 40% of medical students in Pakistan believed that avoiding pork consumption could effectively prevent H1N1. Another study in China showed that 30% of Chinese general population believed that food could transmit H1N1. In general, the general public in Hong Kong over-estimated the fatality rate of the H1N1 (around 40%) and believed that H1N1 is associated with higher fatality and bodily damages as compared to seasonal flu (50%-60%).\n\nWe confirmed that unlike SARS, mental distress is relatively light during the H1N1 pandemic, possible due to the milder consequences of H1N1 as compared to SARS. Except for the peak of incidence of H1N1 in September, only \uf0bb10% of the respondents felt worried about contracting H1N1 and very few reported distress. About two-fifth of the general public expressed would not be bothered by H1N1 infection. No panic has been caused by the pandemic. Avoidance behaviors and use of face mask in the absence of ILI symptoms became less prevalent over time. Such a trend was also understandable as a Malaysian study showed that fear and avoidance changed according to the number of reported deaths (7) . The general public in Hong Kong has apparently been becoming more rational to live with the pandemic, saving potential economic threats.\n\nIn contrast, decreasing trends in perceived severity of and anxiety associated with H1N1 were observed among Dutch population as the pandemic progressed (9) . Perceived susceptibility was quite low and did not show obvious trend during the study period; 10%-15% of the general public considered himself/herself susceptible of contracting H1N1 in the coming year. Such findings are comparable to those in a study in Korea, where only 8% of the college students perceived high susceptibility to contracting H1N1.\n\nAs the pandemic progressed, we see a gradual increase in the proportions of participants believing that 1) school suspension policies is not necessary, 2) the government should suspend all pandemic control measures, and 3) the government should treat H1N1 as the same way as seasonal flu. At the same time, people were less worried about contracting H1N1, less likely to feel mental health distress, and engaging in preventive behaviors less frequently over time. It is potentially attributed to people's gaining understanding about the severity of the pandemic and getting used to the pandemic over time. These findings provide some support to the idea that people's risk perceptions of the disease and behavioral responses are consistent with their perceptions about the necessity of some pandemic control policies.\n\nGovernments in other countries seemed not to be well-supported. A study in Australia showed that people were not supporting the school closure policy as they believed that H1N1 was mild and the policy could not stop H1N1 from spreading (5) . Another study in Turkey showed that the public generally perceived that its government was not managing H1N1 well and had a low level of trust to government's H1N1 information. A similar trend was also observed in the Netherlands, perceived reliability of government information decreased (9) . Over half of Dutch respondents believed that the threat was exaggerated by the media and government (9) .\n\nThe general public maintains high level of preventive behaviors and a low level of mental distress throughout the study period.\n\nCompared to other countries, the general public in Hong Kong seemed to be more compliant to preventive behaviors like frequent handwashing and be more equipped with knowledge related to H1N1. Misconceptions became less prevalent but were still noticeable.\n\nGiven the prior experience with SARS, Hong Kong government kept its vigilance for H1N1 by daily reporting of infection cases and frequent TV/radio commercials about H1N1 prevention. Dissemination of knowledge and frequent updates about H1N1 pandemic from the government may partially explain the consistently high rate of preventive behaviors and relatively better knowledge.\n\nPerceived severity and susceptibility remained relatively stable and somehow low. The public rated the government very highly at the beginning at the pre-community outbreak phase (1) but the rating declined over time. However, the public was still supporting the government to have treat H1N1 differently from seasonal flu, and the overall support was still very reasonable. "}
