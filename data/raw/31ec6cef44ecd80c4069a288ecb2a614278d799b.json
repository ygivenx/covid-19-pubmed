{"title": "Type I IFN family members: Similarity, differences and interaction", "body": "Interferon (IFN) was first discovered as an antiviral agent during studies on virus interference [1, 2] . Isaacs and Lindenmann reported in 1957 that influenza virus-infected chick cells produced a secreted factor that mediated the transfer of a virus-resistant state active against both homologous and heterologous viruses [1] . This seminal observation, along with similar findings described by Nagano and Kojima in 1958 [2] , set the stage for subsequent studies that led to the elucidation of the IFN system in exquisite detail [3] .\n\nAlmost 60 years after the discovery of Isaacs and Lindenmann, considerable progress has been made toward answering multiple questions about IFN family members and their effects on the virushost interaction. Advances made while elucidating the IFN system contributed significantly to our understanding in multiple areas of mammalian cell biology and biochemistry, ranging from the pathways of signal transduction to the biochemical mechanisms of transcriptional and translational control to the molecular basis of viral pathogenesis [3] , and led to the development of the first ''cytokine-based'' therapy in the 70s, now licensed worldwide for viral disease, malignant and even immune disorders [4] .\n\nAfter the first discovery of Type I IFN during 1950s [1] and Type II IFN in 1965 [5] , in 2003 two groups independently reported the discovery of a trio of novel interferon-like cytokines that are referred to as either IFNl1, l2, and l3 or interleukin-29 (IL-29), IL-28A, and IL-28B, respectively [6, 7] , and constitute type III IFN. Both groups also identified and characterized the novel receptor, IFNlR1 (also known as IL-28RA), through which these cytokines mediate their biological activities [8] .\n\nIFNs are key cytokines in the establishment of a multifaceted antiviral response. Three distinct types of IFNs are now recognized (types I, II, and III) based on their structural features, receptor usage and biological activities [8] . A synopsis of the major features of IFN family member components is reported in Table 1 . Type I IFN family in humans consists of 14 IFNa species [9] and a single species of IFNb, IFNk, IFNv, and IFNe, while there is only one type II IFN known as IFNg. All the type I IFN components lack introns and are clustered on the short arm of chromosome 9 in human and chromosome 4 in mouse genome. The single IFNg gene possesses three introns and maps to the long arm of chromosome 12 in human, and chromosome 10 in mouse genome. Although some IFNs are modified post-translationally by N-and O-glycosylation, the major human IFNa subspecies are not glycosylated [3] . IFNa and IFNb gene products appear to function as monomers, whereas IFNg appear to function as homodimers [10] . On the other hand, IFNl genes are clustered together on human 19 or murine 7 chromosome. The IFNl3 gene (IL28B) is transcribed in the opposite direction of the IFN-l1 (IL29) and IFNl2 (IL28A) genes [8] .\n\nAlthough all IFNs are important mediators of antiviral protection, their roles in antiviral defense vary. Type I IFNs have four major functions. First, they induce cell-intrinsic antimicrobial states in infected and neighboring cells that limit the spread of infectious agents, particularly viral pathogens. Second, they modulate innate immune responses in a balanced manner that promotes antigen presentation and natural killer cell functions while restraining pro-inflammatory pathways and cytokine production. Third, they activate the adaptive immune system, thus promoting the development of high-affinity antigen-specific T and B cell responses and immunological memory [9] . Fourth, they present an antiproliferative activity: in fact, several recent studies showed type I IFN-induced autophagy in multiple cancer cell lines highlighting a new function of type I IFN as an inducer of autophagy. This new function of type I IFN may play an important role in viral clearance, antigen presentation, inhibition of proliferation, as well as a positive feedback loop for the production of type I IFN [11] . Type I IFNs are protective in acute viral infections but can have either protective or deleterious roles in bacterial infections and autoimmune diseases. Most cell types produce IFNb, whereas haematopoietic cells, particularly plasmacytoid dendritic cells, are the predominant producers of IFNa. Type I IFN production is induced after the sensing of microbial products by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs)4-6 and by cytokines [9] . IFNg is mainly secreted by T lymphocytes, natural killer cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. IFNg secretion by natural killer (NK) cells and professional antigen presenting cells is likely to be important in early host defense against infection, whereas T lymphocytes become the major source of IFNg in the adaptive immune response. IFNg production is controlled by cytokines secreted by antigen presenting cells, most notably IL12 and IL18. Macrophage recognition of many pathogens induces the secretion of IL-12 and several chemokines. These chemokines attract natural killer cells to the site of inflammation, and IL-12 promotes IFNg synthesis in these cells [12] . IFNg also plays a central role in the development of antitumor immune responses, and it can amplify the induction of antiviral activity by IFNa or IFNb. Therefore, type I and type II IFN often work together to activate a variety of innate and adaptive immune responses that result in the induction of effective antitumor immunity and the elimination of viral infections [10, 13] . On the other hand, the IFNl signal transduction cascade is very similar to that induced by type I IFNs (IFNa or IFNb). Therefore, it is not surprising that type I and type III IFNs exert similar biological activities. Both types of IFN possess the intrinsic ability to induce antiviral activity in cells [8] . In fact, the IFNls are usually coexpressed together with type I IFNs by virus infected cells [6, 7] .\n\nIFNs are part of the larger family of class II cytokines that also includes 6 IL-10-related cytokines: IL-10, IL-19, IL-20, IL-22, IL-24, and IL-26 [14] [15] [16] as well as several viral IL-10-related cytokines [17] . Class II cytokines all signal via receptors that share common motifs in their extracellular domains, and are indicated as class II cytokine receptor family (CRF2). Consequently, IFNs and the IL-10related cytokines are sometimes referred to as ''CRF2 cytokines'' [8] . However, although the tertiary structure of IFNg resembles that of IL-10, its primary structure significantly diverges from all of the CRF2 ligands. The most recent addition to the CRF2 family members, type III IFN or IFNl, demonstrates structural features of the IL-10-related cytokines but also induces antiviral activity in a variety of target cells, which supports their functional classification as a new IFN type [6, 7] . Phylogenetically, the IFNl genes reside somewhere between the type I IFN and IL-10 gene families. Amino acid sequence comparison shows that the type III IFN members exhibit about 5-18% identity with either type I IFN members or the IL-10-related cytokines. The IFNl proteins bind and signal through a receptor complex composed of the unique IFNlR1 chain (also known as IL-28RA) and the shared IL-10R2 chain which is also a part of the receptor complexes for IL-10, IL-22, and IL-26. In contrast, all type I IFN members exert their biological activities through a heterodimeric receptor complex composed of the IFNaR1 (IFNAR1) and IFNaR2 (IFNAR2) chains, and type II IFN (IFNg) engages the IFNgR1 (IFNGR1) and IFNgR2 (IFNGR2) chains to assemble its functional receptor complex [8] .\n\nIn the canonical type I IFN-induced signaling pathway described over 25 years ago, IFNAR engagement was shown to activate the receptor-associated protein tyrosine kinases Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), which phosphorylate the latent cytoplasmic transcription factors Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2. Tyrosinephosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 dimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they assemble with IFN-regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) to form a trimolecular complex called IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3). ISGF3 binds to its cognate DNA sequences, which are known as IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs), thereby directly activating the transcription of ISGs, many of which establish a cellular antiviral state. ISG-encoded proteins restrain pathogens by several mechanisms, including the inhibition of viral transcription, translation and replication, the degradation of viral nucleic acids and the alteration of cellular lipid metabolism. Cellular responses to IFNAR ligation are cell type-and contextdependent and vary during the course of an immune response [9] . Therefore, as said above, although the IFNl members do not use the IFNa receptor complex for signaling, signaling through either IFNl or IFNa receptor complexes results in the activation of the same Jak-STAT signal transduction cascade [8] .\n\nThe relevance of genetic and epigenetic variations in determining the range of susceptibility and of clinical severity of several diseases, including those caused by infectious agents, in the human population is well known. Therefore, considering the importance of IFN system in antiviral defense mechanisms and, more broadly, in immune response, it is not surprising that genetic and epigenetic variations within the IFN genes and in those associated with sensing/signaling/response are associated with a range of diseases. In recent years, inborn errors affecting the production of IFN family members have been reported in human patients. Insights into the specific role of human IFNa/b and IFN-l-induction pathways in anti-viral immunity have been provided by the study of herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE), the most common sporadic viral encephalitis in Western countries caused by the almost ubiquitous and almost innocuous herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1). HSE has been shown to result from a new group of primary immunodeficiencies; the first two genetic etiologies of this disease have been identified as UNC-93B and Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) deficiencies. These discoveries demonstrated the critical role of the UNC-93Bdependent, TLR3-IFNa, IFNb, and IFNl pathway in immunity to HSV-1 in children. The wide redundancy of other TLR-mediated IFN induction pathways is probably responsible for the lack of increased susceptibility to common viral infection and HSE that is reported for IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK-4)-deficient patients, who display impaired production of IFNa, IFNb, and IFNl following the activation of TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 [18] . Increased susceptibility to multiple viruses, including HSV-1, has been reported also for inborn errors affecting the response to IFN family members, such as STAT1 or TYK2 deficiency [19] . In addition, IFNg deficiencies confer Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD) that is a rare congenital syndrome characterized by the occurrence of severe, often disseminated, clinical disease, caused by weakly virulent mycobacterial species, such as bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9 rin (BCG) vaccines and non-tuberculous environmental mycobacteria (EM), in otherwise healthy individuals [18] . IFNg production is controlled by cytokines secreted by myeloid cells, including IL-12 and IL23. Disorders of six genes of the IL-12/23-IFNg circuit were discovered since 1996, demonstrating the critical role of this circuit in protective immunity to mycobacteria [20, 21] . The role of IL-12-dependent IFNg production has been confirmed by recent studies, showing that defects in IL-12p40 or IL-12Rb1 and specific mutations in NEMO [nuclear factor (NF)-kB essential modulator] are specifically associated with impaired IFNg-mediated immunity and clinical MSMD [18] . Furthermore, over 347 IFNg gene variants and several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in either IFNg promoter region or in NFkB binding regions, have been described in multiple ethnic populations, often affecting IFNg gene expression. Many of these variants appear to modulate susceptibility not only to infectious diseases, especially tuberculosis and viral hepatitis, but also to some non-infectious conditions such as aplastic anemia and psoriasis; susceptibility to cervical cancer, that is in a position to bridge viral and non viral mechanisms, is also influenced by host genetic factors targeting IFNg reviewed in [22] . Besides genetic variants, several epigenetic modifications are also described, increasing IFNg expression in Th1 lymphocytes and reducing IFNg expression in Th2 lymphocytes Increased methylation of IFNg promoter and consequent decreased expression of this gene is associated with asthma; on the contrary, decreased methylation is associated with increased diastolic blood pressure, biliary atresia, dental pulp inflammation and chronic periodontitis [22] . Overall, human inborn errors affecting IFN system have provided conclusive evidence that the members of IFN family are crucial for protective immunity and innate defense against viral, bacterial and non-infectious diseases. However non-redundant role of these members seems to arise, with a certain polarization of protection, as IFNg seems to be essential for anti-mycobacterial immunity, whereas IFNa/b and IFNl are essential for anti-viral immunity [18] .\n\nVirus survival and spread into the host depend on the ability to avoid recognition and control by the host defense. Therefore viruses use immunoevasion strategies to counteract the host defenses, particularly against effectors of the innate immunity, as the interferon system and the interferon-induced molecules (Fig. 1) . Virtually all viruses of mammals have developed multiple mechanisms of immune evasion. Viruses with wide genomes and well adapted to the host (Poxviruses, Herpesviruses) have multiple tools to interfere with the IFN system. In general, differences in the strategies lie on the host cell machinery, rather than on the IFN type. Viruses can evade host defenses through inhibition of IFN induction and/or by inhibition of their signaling pathways, through activation of the IFN regulatory factors (IRFs), the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) factors, or the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) [23] [24] [25] . Viruses developed multiple escape strategies. The IFN-induced Mx pathway is active against a wide range of viruses by blocking primary transcription of the incoming viral genome, by its virionic polymerase, but so far there is no evidence for a virus-coded inhibitor of Mx. Since in the presence of Mx, the virus cannot replicate, the generation of Mx escape mutants/strategies is virtually impossible. Nevertheless, viruses subvert the Mx system, simply by suppressing IFN production in the host (see below), thereby avoiding Mx expression in potential target cells [26] .\n\nThe cell can detect an ongoing viral invasion, through sensors located in the cytoplasm or on the membrane of endosomes. These molecules include the cytosolic retinoic-acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-1) and the melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) dsRNA helicases, through downstream interaction with the interferon promoter-stimulating factor 1 (IPS-1) adaptor protein, and some Toll-like receptors (TLR), as TLR3, 7, 8, and 9 [23, 24, 27] are sensed by TLR9; by convergent transcription they can also produce dsRNA and thus activate TLR3, IFN-inducible dsRNAdependent protein kinase (PKR), and also MDA5 and/or RIG-I.\n\nRetroviruses (such as HIV-1 and human T-lymphotropic virus I and II) have a diploid positive-sense ssRNA genome in the virion, that is reverse transcribed into dsDNA provirus, which is then integrated into the host genome. Retroviral ssRNA is sensed by TLR7 and TLR8. The reverse transcription intermediates are recognized by the cytosolic IFI16 and cGAS DNA sensors, and this leads to the initiation of the type I IFN antiviral response, pyroptosis and apoptosis, under the regulation by host restriction factors such as SAMHD1 and TREX1.\n\nAfter virus sensing, a series of transcription factors are activated within the cell, leading to IFN production, i.e. IRF-3, NF-kB, the activator protein 1 (AP-1), and the chromatin remodeling associated p300/CREB-binding protein (p300/CBP). These activated molecules translocate to the nucleus and interact with the IFN promoter sequences, to upregulate the expression of interferon genes. IRF-3 activity is hampered by human papillomavirus (HPV) through the E6 protein, by the Influenza A virus through the NS1 protein, that is thought to bind and sequester viral dsRNA, to protect it from cell intrinsic viral RNA detection, and in Filoviruses there is an inverse correlation between the magnitude of IFNa/IFNb responses and virulence in humans [23, 25, 28, 29] .\n\nThis signaling pathway (that acts through the JAK and TYK2 kinases, IRF-9, and STAT proteins) varies with the IFN type, since the IFNa/b receptor on the plasma membrane activates the JAK1 and TYK2 molecules, while the IFNg receptor activates JAK1 and JAK2; by protein phosphorylation the signal is transmitted to the nucleus [30, 31] . Many viruses counteract the JAK-STAT pathway by their V and C proteins, as Paramyxoviruses, rubiviruses, etc., whose V and C proteins block the induction of IFNb and can degrade the STAT proteins or prevent their phosphorylation or limit their nuclear translocation [23] . This can make the cells unresponsive to both type I and type II interferons, as for the Sendai virus, or the cells do not respond to IFNa but still remain responsive to IFNg, as it occurs for measles virus [32] . The VP24 protein of the lethal Ebola virus binds the karyopherin alpha nuclear transporter, to inhibit STAT1 nuclear transport and render cells refractory to IFNs [33] .\n\nViruses (influenza virus, HCV, herpes simplex virus) can also induce the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins, negative regulators of the JAK-STAT signaling [23, 34] . The already mentioned virus-coded C and V proteins can interfere with the IFNinduced PKR (protein kinase R) and ADAR1 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1) enzymes, thus preventing the inhibition of translation and the induction of apoptosis, thus helping virus presence and replication within the cell [35, 36] . Complex viruses have multiple mechanisms to interfere with the IFN system; the various poxviruses are active against type I and type III interferons through a secreted protein, antagonize NF-kB and have a specific interferon-gamma-binding protein that interfere with the binding to the cell receptor [37] [38] [39] [40] . Almost every step of the IFN response can be interfered by the vaccinia poxvirus: induction of IFNs, activation of the NF-kB and IRF-3 and of the JAK-STAT pathways, as well as the activity of the effectors of the antiviral state, such as those involving PKR-and the 2 0 -5 0 -Oligoadenylate synthetase [37, 41] . Recent studies have shown that the Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus (APMV) may be pathogen for humans, causing pneumonia. In human PBMCs APMV replicates, inducing type I IFNs, but inhibiting IFN stimulated genes (ISG) induction by viroceptor and STAT-1 and STAT-2 dephosphorylation independent mechanisms; it is resistant to IFNa2, but sensitive to IFNb [42] .\n\nThe ability of IFN family members to protect against various viral infections descends from the complex transcriptional programs they initiate. Each type of IFN can induce the expression of hundreds of genes to mediate various biological responses. Although IFNs are effective inhibitors of viruses such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), almost all RNA and DNA viruses have evolved mechanisms to subvert the host IFN response, and are able to resist, at least in part, to the IFN-mediate inhibition. However, several studies have shown that viruses normally resistant to the effects of type I or type II IFN separately, are susceptible to IFNs when used in combination. The reciprocal potentiation of type I or type II IFN is a well known phenomenon described since 1979 [43] , and has been observed for both antiviral and antitumor effects [44] . Synergistic antiviral activity resulting from the contemporary presence of both IFN types has also been described in HIV-infected patients and in some autoimmune diseases [45] . It has been demonstrated that IFNa/b and IFNg synergistically inhibit the replication of HSV-1 both in vitro and in vivo [46, 47] . In addition, several reports have indicated that IFN family members used in combination have a synergistic antiviral activity against other viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) [48] , Lassa virus (LASV) [49] , Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV) [50] , human Cytomegalovirus (hCMV) [47] and severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [51, 52] .\n\nPeng and collaborators tried to better understand the mechanisms underlying the synergism between type I and type II IFN in the inhibition of HSV-1 replication. They showed that IFNb1 and IFNg interaction is exploited through either an independent, i.e. inducing distinct gene categories, or a cooperative mechanism, i.e. inducting a common subset of genes at a level that is much higher than with either IFN alone. The genes cooperatively induced by IFNb1 and IFNg included those involved in apoptosis, RNA degradation and inflammatory response. As result, the combination of IFNb1 and IFNg induced more apoptosis and inhibited HSV-1 gene expression and DNA replication significantly more than treatment with either IFN alone [53] .\n\nWhile synergism between type I and type II IFN is well established, little is known about the effect of type I and type III IFNs combination, as available studies report contrasting information, with synergism reported for some viruses (i.e. HCV) [54, 55] , but not for other viruses (i.e. EMCV and HSV-2) [56] . In addition, antagonism for the intracellular pathways involved in antiviral activity has been reported [57] . In a recent study [58] possible synergism/antagonism between IFNa and/or IFNl in the inhibition of virus replication (EMCV, WNV lineage 1 and 2, CHIKV and HSV-1) has been investigated in different cell lines. The results showed that IFNl is less effective than IFNa for both the inhibition of virus replication, and that IFNl antagonized the IFNa-driven inhibition of virus replication. The findings on antiviral activity are paralleled by analogous trends in the induction of the molecular mediators of antiviral activity (MxA and 2 0 -5 0 OAS). An overview of the interactions between IFN family members is reported in Table 2 .\n\nStudies of the late Sixties revealed that the antiviral agent IFN was able also to suppress the growth of tumors [59] . Since then, IFNs were shown to be pleiotropic biologic response modifiers, that, upon activation of thousands genes [60] induce a broad spectrum of activities, regulating cell cycle, differentiation, expression of pivotal molecules on the plasma membrane, release of mediators, etc., that can be relevant for cell proliferation, innate and adaptive immunity, hematopoiesis, angiogenesis, and with important outcomes also for cancer, autoimmunity, and therapy [61, 62] . A survey of the spectrum of biological activities of the interferons is reported in Table 3 . Importantly, because of the multitude of IFN-induced genes, opposite effects can be determined by the same IFN, depending on timing and dosages, both in vitro and in vivo, as shown since the Seventies in the mouse Friend erythroleukemia cells [63, 64] ; IFN effects on patients were defined ''Janus-like'', as IFNs may have both beneficial and detrimental effects, depending on the disease context [65] .\n\nThis property of all IFNs can help the host by depletion of infected cells, restrain excess cell-mediated immunity and inhibit angiogenesis, with consequent reduction of tumor growth; it may occur both in cancer and normal cells, in vitro and in vivo. Type II IFN is more effective than type I IFN (being IFNb more potent than IFNa), while type III IFN is restrained by the low or limited presence of the specific receptor on the membrane of the target cells [66] [67] [68] . IFNb has a greater receptor-binding affinity than IFNa, and this finding may account for the more potent and different antiproliferative and perhaps immunoregulatory actions of IFNb [69] . The anti-growth activity of IFNs is mediated by arrest of the cell cycle and induction of caspases and apoptosis; it occurs in all the somatic cells tested, with differences depending on the IFN type and dosage [66, 70] . The anti-proliferative activity of type III IFNs does not occur in all the receptor-positive cells but depends on the cell type, at variance with the antiviral activity and up-regulation of MHC class I molecules [66] . Because of possible therapy of melanoma, type I IFNs were extensively studied in keratinocytes and melanocytes [67] ; of note, the IFNb expression in vitro by undifferentiated, growth-arrested murine keratinocytes suggested that its production by terminally differentiated cells was associated with arrest of proliferation. Recently it was reported the induction of autophagy by type I and type II IFNs in cancer cells, a mechanism that may counteract the pro-apoptotic functions of IFNs [11, 71, 72] , through the p38 MAPK pathway and ATF6 phosphorylation [72] .\n\nIt can be modulated by IFNs, as shown by an endless list of reports. Type I and type II IFNs were shown to affect the erythropoiesis pathways [63, 64, 73] . Chronic IFNg production may cause anemia and bone marrow failure, hence it may be involved in malignant hematopoietic malignancies [73] . Another IFN-regulated process is adypogenesis, that is inhibited by type I and II IFNs [74, 75] . In normal thyrocytes both IFNa and IFNg regulate the expression of integrins (target for infiltrating lymphocytes) and the signaling induced by cell adhesion to fibronectin [76] . Moreover, IFNg induces CXCR3-binding chemokines, which in turn recruit Th1 lymphocytes, with an important role in the initiation of autoimmune thyroiditis.\n\nIFNs are potent immunomodulators, especially IFNg; among the IFNa subtypes, each has its own immunomodulatory pattern [77] . In general, IFNs stimulate already differentiated cells in the short term, while, by growth inhibition, in the long term or with higher IFN concentrations, they may reduce the replacement of exhausted cells with their precursors. Immunomodulatory effects include enhancement of surface molecules such as MHC (major histocompatibility complex) antigens, several receptors, and modulation of the activation and differentiation of effector cells, as monocyte/macrophages, dendritic cells (DC), B, T and NK cells. Type I and III IFNs and, with higher efficiency, type II IFN upregulate the expression of class I MHC and co-stimulatory molecules by tissue cells and immune cells, as the DCs, that differentiate into efficient antigen-and self-antigen-presenting cells, leading to activation of quiescent reactive T helper cells [66, [78] [79] [80] . The expression of class II MHC molecules is upregulated by all three IFN types, being the type II the most active [81, 82] . The effect of the latter IFN can be interfered by type I IFNs [83] . The activation of DR and of chemokine receptors may modify the phenotype (and recognition of progeny virions), and virus binding on the membrane [84, 85] . Type I IFNs thus function to elevate both innate and adaptive immune responses, with induction of cytokines and chemokines, activation and differentiation of CD4+ T cells and CTLs, the activation and differentiation of B cells, the production of antibodies and the switching of immunoglobulin (Ig)isotypes [61, 66, 77] . Type III IFNs were not demonstrated to increase antibody formation, and were shown to modulate Th1/Th2 cells balance through a different mechanism from type I IFNs [66] . IFNg, but not IFNa or IFNb can induce neutrophils to suppress lymphocyte proliferation through the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) [86] . Type II IFN is essential also in immunity intracellular non-viral parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii, Cryptosporidium parvum, Leishmania major, Trypanosoma cruzi, etc., and elicits strong cell-autonomous killing of intracellular parasites; also type I IFN, however is induced during these infections: it does not exert an intrinsic control of parasites, but its signaling recruits NK cells, which then mediate parasite killing by producing type II IFN [87] .\n\nDysregulation in production/signaling of all IFN types are associated to a variety of pathologies. Activation of IFNa pathways were related to several autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Addison's disease, etc. [88] . Miscarriage of humans and animals has been associated with higher levels of IFNg, that, on the other hand, is involved in maintaining the decidual layer and vascular remodeling in the uterus [89] . Abnormality in IFN-stimulated gene patterns, causing failures in immunotolerance in early childhood were proposed to be contribute to the development of type 1 diabetes and cases of type 1 diabetes were also related to treatments with pegylated IFN and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C [90] . Cardiovascular complications can be observed in IFN-treated subjects (arrhythmia, myocarditis, reversible hypertension, ischemic heart disease, pericarditis and pericardial effusion, cardiomyopathy) and are generally reversible [88] . Sarcoidosis, a systemic chronic granulomatous disease of unknown cause, is a rare adverse effect from the use of type I IFNa and IFNb, that reflects an exaggerated cellmediated immune response to an unknown persistent antigen, with higher levels of circulating IFNg [91] . Thyroid dysfunctions in IFN-treated patients were observed since 1985 [92] , and are still a significant problem for patients receiving either IFNa or IFNb; in vitro and animal studies showed that thyroid inflammation and autoimmunity involve direct effects (increased expression of thyroid differentiation) as well as activation of destructive bystander immune responses [93] . Significant exacerbations were caused by treatment of multiple sclerosis patients with IFNg, while IFNb is currently given as therapy, and seems to be more potent than IFNa [94, 95] . In the EAE animal model of multiple sclerosis, a regulatory role of Type III IFN-producing CD4+ T cells conferring protection against EAE was proposed [96] . Depression and other cognitive and psychiatric disturbances are reported by approximately half of the patients treated with IFNa for chronic hepatitis C and B, Beh\u00e7et's syndrome, melanoma and lymphoma [97] . IFNa determines abnormalities of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and disturbances of brain metabolism, and interferes with neurotrophic signaling, thus hindering neurite outgrowth, synaptic plasticity, endogenous neurogenesis and neuronal survival [97] . Comparing patients receiving pegylated IFNa plus ribavirin with those receiving IFNb plus ribavirin, it was found that depressive symptoms were more prevalent following IFNa than IFNb treatment [98] . In mice, IFNa was reported either to promote antidepressant-like effect associated with an increase in brain serotonin turn over, or to promote a depression-like phenotype, mediated by suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis and induction of depression [99] , while the lack of IFNg increased anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors of IFNg-knocked out animals, suggesting that IFNg is involved in hippocampal neurogenesis and CNS plasticity [100] .\n\nInterferons have extraordinary antiviral efficacy; therefore viruses have developed multiple strategies of immune evasion to counteract IFN induction and signaling and the interferon-induced effector molecules. During the last decades, IFNs were shown to display a multifaceted, Janus-like congeries of activities, with synergisms and antagonisms between IFN types. Because of the multitude of IFN-induced genes, also opposite effects can be determined by the same IFN, depending on timing and dosages, and IFNs may have both beneficial and detrimental effects, depending on the disease context. Genetic diversity, with polymorphisms and mutations, can modulate the extent of IFN responses and the susceptibility to infections, and genetic and epigenetic variations within the IFN genes and in those associated with sensing/signaling/response can be linked to diseases. On the whole, IFNs are pleiotropic biologic response modifiers, that, upon activation of thousands genes, induce a broad spectrum of activities, regulating cell cycle, differentiation, plasma membrane molecules, release of mediators, etc., that can be relevant for cell proliferation, innate and adaptive immunity, hematopoiesis, angiogenesis and other body functions.\n\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
