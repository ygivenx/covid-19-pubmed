As Mycoplasma spp. lack many of the metabolic pathways 94 associated with energy production and synthesis of cell components found in other bacteria, they 95 are fully dependent on host cells (Citti & Blanchard, 2013) . Hemoplasmas have therefore been 96 described as mostly host specialists (Pitcher & Nicholas, 2005 ), yet interspecies and potentially 97 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

At least 44 of the 70 bat 144 species in Belize have been recorded in this region (Herrera et al., 2018; Reid, 1997) . Bats were 145 captured with mist nets primarily along flight paths and occasionally at the exits of roosts from 146 19:00 until 22:00. Harp traps were also set from 18:00 to 05:00. In KK, Desmodus rotundus, 147\n\nTrachops cirrhosus, and Chrotopterus auritus were captured at their shared roost. In the LAR, 148\n\nDesmodus rotundus, Saccopteryx bilineata, and Glossophaga soricina were sampled from a 149 shared roost, although individuals were also sampled along flight paths across the greater site. 150\n\nMore broadly, patterns of roost sharing of bat species in northern Belize remain elusive. 151\n\nBats were placed in cloth bags until processing and were identified to species (and sex) 152 based on morphology (Reid, 1997). Reproductive activity was indicated by the presence of 153 scrotal testes in males and by the evidence of pregnancy or lactation in females; across bat 154 species, 69% of males and 42% of females were in reproductive condition. We also visually 155 screened bats for the presence of ectoparasites (i.e., bat flies, ticks, bat bugs, mites; Ter Hofstede, 156 Mart\u00ednez-Meyer, & L\u00f3pez-Santiago, 2014). We also considered the proportion of plant-based 209 items in diet. We simplified foraging strata into aerial (n=14), arboreal (n=16, including 210 scansorial), and ground-or aquatic-level foraging (n=3). We also expanded prior compilations of 211 only foliage; n=6) or closed (e.g., hollows, caves; n=27), and roost flexibility was simplified to 214 using one (n=16) or multiple roost types (n=17). We classified maximum colony sizes as small-215 to-medium (e.g., under 100 individuals; n=20) or large (e.g., hundreds to thousands; n=13; Reid, in Belize (Fig. S2 ). Yet because more widely distributed species could have more opportunities 219 for pathogen sharing due to range overlap, we used the geosphere package and data from the 220 GLMMs that considered all fixed effects as well as interactions between sex and reproduction 230 and between site and year. We also considered a model that excluded site to account for possible 231 non-independence of LAR and KK alongside an intercept-only model. As vampire bats were 232 banded for a mark-recapture study (Volokhov et al., 2017) and some were sampled between and 233 within years (n=14), we randomly selected one of each recapture. After removing recaptures and 234 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

We included random effects for bat 236 species and phylogeny, the latter of which used the phylogenetic covariance matrix (B\u00fcrkner, 237 2017). We ran four chains for 20,000 iterations with a burn-in period of 10,000, thinned every 10 238 steps, for a total 4,000 samples. We compared GLMMs using the leave-one-out cross-validation 239 (LOOIC) and assessed fit with a Bayesian R 2 , including the total modeled variance and that The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.21.885921 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nTo identify species trait correlates of prevalence, we fit 11 PGLS models (weighted by 258 sampling variance) with body mass, annual fecundity (litters per year * pups per litter), dietary 259 guild, quantitative diet, foraging strata, aspect ratio, roost type, roost flexibility, colony size, 260 geographic range size, and evolutionary distinctiveness as predictors. We also fit PGLS models 261 with only sample size or an intercept. We compared models with Akaike information criterion 262 corrected for small sample sizes (AICc) and estimated Genotypes were designated as novel if (i) sequences differed from the closest hemoplasma 273 sequences in GenBank by \u2265 1.5% and/or (ii) if sequence similarity was <1.5% but genotype-274 specific reproducible mutations (at least two per sequence) were observed between hemoplasma 275 sequences from at least two independent bat samples and the nearest GenBank hemoplasma 276 sequences. These genotype-specific mutations were further used to differentiate closely related 277 hemoplasma genotypes from our sample. We caution that genotype is not synonymous with 278 species, as analysis of the 16S rRNA gene alone is insufficient for accurate species identification 279 .

Future studies using genomics or housekeeping 280 genes may identify independent but closely related hemoplasma species in our genotypes. 281\n\nTo assess if hemoplasma genotype assignments were associated with site and year, we 282 used \u03c7 2 tests with p values generated through a Monte Carlo procedure. Prior to our phylogenetic 283 and network analyses of genotype distributions across bat species (see below), we used another 284 \u03c7 2 test to assess the association between hemoplasma genotype identify and bat host identity. 285 286\n\nTo determine the degree to which bat hemoplasma genotypes display host specificity and to 288 describe their evolutionary relationships with host species, we used our bat and hemoplasma 289 phylogenies to construct a binary association matrix. To test the dependence of the hemoplasma 290 phylogeny upon the bat phylogeny and thus assess evidence of evolutionary codivergence, we 291 applied the Procrustes Approach to Cophylogeny (PACo) using distance matrices and the paco 292 We used hemoplasma genotype assignments to create a network, with each node representing a 299 bat species and edges representing shared genotypes among bat species pairs. We built an 300 adjacency matrix using the igraph package and used the Louvain method to assess the structure 301 of bat-hemoplasma communities within this network (Csardi & Nepusz, 2006) .

We assessed 305 statistical significance with a quadratic assignment procedure via the sna package (Butts, 2008). 306\n\nWe calculated two metrics of network centrality to quantify different aspects of how 307 important a node (bat species) is to hemoplasma genotype sharing: degree and eigenvector 308 centrality (Bell, Atkinson, & Carlson, 1999). Whereas degree indicates the number of other 309 species with which a host shares bacterial genotypes (i.e., links per node), eigenvector centrality 310 indicates the tendency for a host to share genotypes with species that also share more genotypes 311 (i.e., connectivity). Eigenvector centrality is thus an extension of degree that can identify hubs of 312 parasite sharing (G\u00f3mez, Nunn, & Verd\u00fa, 2013). These two metrics were moderately correlated 313 (\u03c1=0.59), with many non-zero degree species displaying zero eigenvector centrality. To examine 314 spatial and temporal patterns in host centrality, we built separate adjacency networks per each 315 site and year. We fit separate GLMs to ask how hemoplasma sharing centrality was predicted by 316\n\nsite, year, and the two-way interaction. Degree was modeled as a Poisson-distributed response, 317 while eigenvector centrality was logit-transformed and used Gaussian errors. We next applied 318 phylogenetic factorization to both metrics and weighted the algorithms by the square-root sample 319 size per species (Garamszegi, 2014). We then fit the same PGLS models used in our prevalence 320 analysis to identify the most competitive trait predictors of bat species centrality to hemoplasma 321 sharing. To lastly assess whether network centrality is associated with hemoplasma prevalence, 322 we fit two weighted PGLS models with each centrality metric as a univariate predictor. Fig. 2A) . This result was weakly sensitive to overrepresentation by Desmodus rotundus, as 333 effect size and the prevalence sex difference was weaker when we randomly subsampled this 334 species (Fig. 2) . Across all models, fixed effects only explained up to 7% of the modeled 335 variance, suggesting more variation explained by the species and phylogeny random effects. 336\n\nInter-species variation in hemoplasma prevalence 338 Across bat species, hemoplasma prevalence ranged from 0% to 100% (x =0.37). We estimated 339\n\nPagel's \u03bb in logit-transformed prevalence to be 0.39, indicating moderate phylogenetic signal. 340\n\nSimilarly, phylogenetic factorization identified one bat clade with significantly lower prevalence 341 compared to the paraphyletic remainder: the Emballonuridae (12% infected; Fig. 3A ). Our trait-342 based analysis showed that relatively larger species (\u03b2=1.48, p=0.01, R 2 =0.24) and those with 343 larger colonies (\u03b2=0.67, p=0.06, R 2 =0.20) had higher prevalence ( Fig. 3B; Table 1 ). Relatively 344 heavier (\u2265 20 g) and larger colony species included Desmodus rotundus, Molossus rufus, and 345\n\nPteronotus mesoamericanus, for which prevalence was greater than 58%. Although these three 346 species were also heavily sampled, other well-sampled species such as Sturnira parvidens and 347\n\nCarollia sowelli had lower prevalence, and sample size did not predict prevalence (Table 1) . 348 description of these 29 bacterial genotypes is provided in the Supporting Information (Fig. S3) . 361\n\nAfter controlling for multiple comparisons, our 29 bacterial genotypes were associated 362 with site (\u03c7 2 =47.11, p<0.01) and year (\u03c7 2 =40.40, p<0.01). Genotype composition was more 363 diverse at LAR (Fig. S4) , and KK hemoplasmas were dominated by vampire bat genotypes 364 (VBG1-3). Genotype composition was more idiosyncratic by study year. However, these 29 365 bacterial genotypes were most strongly associated with bat species (\u03c7 2 =3532, p<0.01; Fig. S4 ). 366 367\n\nAlthough some hemoplasma genotypes were shared between bat species (i.e., VBG1, CS2, PPM, 369 EF1, AH1-2, MYE, PLU, SP; n=9), most showed strong host specificity (n=20; Fig. 4 ), suggesting that hemoplasma evolution has 372 mostly tracked bat speciation. However, PACo also demonstrated that only 56% of the 41 unique 373 bat-hemoplasma links displayed significant evidence of coevolution (Fig. S5) , and these patterns 374 were almost exclusively found within the Phyllostomidae (with the exception of Saccopteryx 375 bilineata and its Mycoplasma muris-like bacterial genotype). The other 18 bat-hemoplasma 376 links therefore displayed evidence of phylogenetic incongruence and thus likely host shifts. 377 378\n\nWithin our bat-hemoplasma network, genotype sharing was restricted to five host communities, 380 whereas six genotypes were each restricted to a single bat species (Fig. 5A ). GLMs showed that 381 both the frequency and presence of genotype sharing declined with phylogenetic distance 382 between bat species (Poisson: p<0.001, R 2 =0.08; binomial: p<0.001, R 2 =0.51; Fig. 5B ). 383\n\nBat species shared hemoplasma genotypes with zero to five other species (i.e., degree), 384 and most hosts were not central to the network of genotype sharing (i.e., eigenvector centrality of 385 zero). Six bat species had non-zero eigenvector centrality values that ranged from 37% to 100%, 386 indicating that these hosts generally shared more hemoplasma genotypes with other highly 387 connected hosts. Stratifying our hemoplasma genotype network across sites and years showed 388 that centrality measures varied by space but not time (Fig. S7, Table S5 ). We observed no 389 hemoplasma genotype sharing at KK, likely reflecting lower host diversity (Herrera et al., 2018) . 390\n\nPhylogenetic factorization identified similar bat clades with significantly different 391 centrality compared to the paraphyletic remainder (Fig. 6A-B) . For degree, the algorithm only 392\n\nidentified Artibeus lituratus as being more central (x =5) than other bats (x =1.14). However, 393 phylogenetic factorization identified three taxa in the subfamily Stenodermatinae that had 394 Trait-based analyses showed that degree centrality was best predicted by diet (Table S6) ; 400 bat species feeding more heavily on fruit and nectar shared more bacterial genotypes with other 401 species (\u03b2=0.004, p<0.001, R 2 =0.20; Fig. 6C ). Similarly, eigenvector centrality was best 402 predicted by bat colony size and diet (Table S7 ); highly central species had small colonies 403 (\u03b2 large =-1.93, p=0.05, R 2 =0.13) and fed more on plants (\u03b2=0.03, p<0.01, R 2 =0.10; Fig. 6D ). 404\n\nAs a final analysis, we assessed whether network centrality (i.e., a bat species' role in 405 hemoplasma genotype sharing) predicted contemporary infection prevalence (Fig. S8) . However, 406\n\nwe found no associations between species-level infection prevalence and centrality as measured 407 by degree (\u03b2=-0.13, R 2 =0.03, p=0.42) or eigenvector centrality (\u03b2=-0.20, R 2 <0.01, p=0.79). prevalence were distinct from those in genotype sharing centrality (e.g., large-colony species had 482 higher prevalence but lower connectivity), and prevalence accordingly did not predict centrality. 483 Second, we found general congruence between bat and hemoplasma phylogenies. Although this 484\n\nshows codivergence is a strong evolutionary force, congruence can also stem from preferential 485 Similar to bat viruses, we found moderate phylogenetic signal in hemoplasma prevalence. 525\n\nHowever, these phylogenetic patterns in prevalence were decoupled from those describing bat 526 species centrality in sharing hemoplasmas, such that genotype sharing was generally restricted 527 by bat phylogeny. These findings imply codivergence of bats and their bacterial pathogens 528 alongside rare and phylogenetically constrained host shifts.
