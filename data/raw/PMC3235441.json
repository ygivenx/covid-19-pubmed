{"title": "Interferon Lambda: A New Sword in Cancer Immunotherapy", "body": "Despite the early discovery of interferon (IFN) in 1957, IFN lambdas were just identified during the recent years and classified as a new group, type III IFN. In human, 3 distinct proteins called IFN-\u03bb1, IFN-\u03bb2, and IFN-\u03bb3 have been identified [1, 2]. They are also named interleukin-29 (IL-29), IL-28A, and IL-28B, respectively [3]. The members of this new IFN family were found to interact through unique receptors that are distinct from type I (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) and type II (IFN-\u03b3) IFN receptors. The receptor for type III IFN is composed of the unique IFN-\u03bbR1 chain also called IL-28AR and the IL-10R2 chain, which is shared with IL-10, IL-22, and IL-26 receptor complexes. Although type III IFNs bind to a specific receptor, the downstream signaling is similar to that induced by type I IFNs. Both type I and type III IFNs stimulate common signaling pathways, consisting of the activation of Jak1 and Tyk2 kinases and leading to the activation of IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) transcription complex. ISGF3 is composed of STAT1 and STAT2 and the interferon regulatory factor IRF9 (ISGF3-\u03b3 or p48) (Figure 1). Although there are three genes encoding highly homologous but distinct human IFN-\u03bb proteins (IFN-\u03bb1, IFN-\u03bb2, and IFN-\u03bb3), our search of the mouse genome revealed the existence of only two genes, representing mouse IFN-\u03bb2 and IFN-\u03bb3 gene orthologues, located in chromosome 7 and encoding intact proteins. The mouse IFN-\u03bb1 gene orthologue is a pseudogene containing some variations in addition to a stop codon in the first exon and does not code for an active protein [4]. We have cloned the mouse IFN-\u03bbs (mIFN-\u03bb2 and mIFN-\u03bb3) and IFN-\u03bb receptor (mIFN-\u03bbR1) orthologues and found them to be quite similar to their human counterparts. Experiments showed that similar to their human counterparts, mIFN-\u03bb2 and mIFN-\u03bb3 signal through the IFN-\u03bb receptor complex, activate ISGF3, and are capable of inducing antiviral protection and MHC class I antigen expression in several cell types. The results showed that murine type III IFNs (IFN-\u03bbs) engage a unique receptor complex, composed of IFN-\u03bbR1 and IL-10R2 subunits, to induce signaling and biological activities similar to those of type I IFNs. Interestingly, in contrast to type I and type II IFNs, type III IFNs demonstrate less species specificity.\n\nAlthough type I and type III induced similar cell signaling, the intensity of cell signaling as measured by STAT1 activation appeared to be significantly lower for type III IFNs [4]. In comparison with type I IFN, only restricted cell types respond to type III IFN (Figure 2). Interestingly, we did not find a strict correlation between the intensity of cell signaling induced by IFN-\u03bb and the level of biological activity. For example, in B16 melanoma cells, although IFN-\u03bb induced a very weak STAT1 activation in comparison with IFN-\u03b1, we observed a robust stimulation of MHC class I expression at the cell surface, indicating the potential contribution of cell-specific modulators of the IFN-\u03bb activity.\n\nAntiviral studies performed in vitro and in vivo have shown that both IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03bb contribute to the overall host antiviral defense system [2, 3, 5\u20138]. It has been demonstrated that IFN-\u03bb induces antiviral activity against VSV (vesicular stomatitis virus) and EMCV (encephalomyocarditis) in many human cell lines [2, 3, 9, 10]. However, by using different mouse models of viral infection, Ank et al. demonstrated that IFN-\u03bb was effective against DNA virus, simplex virus 2 HSV2 but not RNA viruses such as EMCV and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus LCMV [6]. Several other studies demonstrated that type III IFNs can also inhibit replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) in vitro [10\u201314]. These studies were important since they underlined the fact that IFN-\u03bb could be used as an alternative to IFN-\u03b1 for HCV patients who are resistant to IFN-\u03b1 treatment. It has been reported that IFN-\u03bb has the ability to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of blood monocyte-derived macrophages that expressed IFN-\u03bb receptors [15] and the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) infection of human astrocytes and neurons [16]. However, in most other cases, the antiviral potency of IFN-\u03bb against several viruses seems to be lower than that of IFN-\u03b1 [2, 3, 8, 9, 13, 17]. In addition, IFN-\u03bb and IFN-\u03b1 may induce distinct signal transduction and gene regulation kinetics [13, 18].\n\nMoreover, type I IFN-\u03b1 activates a plethora of innate and adaptive immune mechanisms that help eliminate tumors and viral infections. IFN-\u03b1 immunoregulatory functions include major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression in normal and tumor cells, activation of NK cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and macrophages, resulting in the promotion of adaptive immune responses against tumors and virally infected cells [19, 20]. The role of IFN-\u03bb in the immune system is currently being investigated by several groups. So far, data suggests that IFN-\u03bb exerts immunomodulatory effects that overlap those of type I IFN. It has been recently demonstrated that human IFN-\u03bb1 (IL-29) modulates the human plasmacytoid DCs function and cytokine response [21, 22]. IFN-\u03bb1 treatment of whole peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upregulated the expression of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 but not IL-1 or TNF. This IFN-\u03bb-induced cytokine production was inhibited by IL-10. By examination of purified cell populations, it was also shown that IFN-\u03bb1 activated monocytes, rather than lymphocytes, resulting in the secretion of the above panel of cytokines, suggesting that IFN-\u03bb1 may be an important activator of innate immune responses particularly at the site of viral infections [21]. IFN-\u03bb1 was also shown to possess immunoregulatory functions on T helper 2 (Th2) responses by markedly inhibiting IL-13. However, only moderate effect was observed on IL-4 and IL-15, the other important cytokines in the Th2 response [23\u201325]. This immunoregulatory function was enhanced through the expression of IFN-\u03bbR1 on CD4+ T cells [23]. These findings correlate with data suggesting that IFN-\u03bb may have an immunoprotective role against asthma, the allergy disease caused by an exaggerated Th2 response [9, 26, 27].\n\nSimilar to IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03bb produced by DCs, in response to toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation, was found to have specific effects on DC differentiation and maturation [28], which include only partial maturation of DCs, upregulation of MHC class I and II molecules, and no induction of co-stimulatory molecules [9, 29]. During their differentiation from monocytes, DCs acquire IFN-\u03bb responsiveness through the expression of IFN-\u03bbR1. Interestingly, DCs treated with IFN-\u03bb promoted the generation of tolerogenic DCs and the IL-2-dependent proliferation of Foxp3-expressing CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) [29]. More recently, Morrow et al. have demonstrated, through DNA vaccination with plasmids encoding IFN-\u03bb3 (IL-28B) and IL-12, that IFN-\u03bb3, just like IL-12, is able to enhance adaptive immunity. However, in contrast to IL-12, IFN-\u03bb3 reduces regulatory T-cell populations. They also showed that unlike IL-12, IFN-\u03bb3 is able to increase the percentage of splenic CD8+ T cells in vaccinated animals and that IFN-\u03bb3 can completely protect mice from death following a lethal influenza challenge [30]. These studies altogether highlight the strong candidacy of IFN-\u03bb as a potential novel immunotherapeutic agent.\n\nIn addition to antiviral and immunomodulatory activities, type I IFNs demonstrate antiproliferative activities in most cell lines, while this activity seems to be restricted with IFN-\u03bbs [9, 17]. Type I IFNs have been shown to induce apoptosis in tumor cells, yet the molecular mechanisms mediating cell death in response to these IFNs remain to be fully explained. By binding to their corresponding cellular receptor complexes, IFNs induce a quick and potent signaling which leads to the expression of more than 300 IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) [13, 31, 32]. Many ISGs encode proteins that have been implicated in apoptosis [33, 34]. Unlike IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03bbs do not inhibit the proliferation of several cell lines including the Daudi cells (a B-lymphoblastoid cell line from Burkitt's lymphoma), which strongly respond to type I IFNs in an antiproliferative assay [2, 3, 10, 17]. However, it was demonstrated that IFN-\u03bbs do inhibit the proliferation of few tumor cell lines, such as the LN319 human gliobastoma cell line [17] and of cells constitutively expressing high levels of IFN-\u03bbR1 [35]. The antiproliferative effects of IFN-\u03bb have been demonstrated in various tumor cell lines that express ectopic or endogenous IFN-\u03bb receptors [17, 36, 37]. Therefore, the ability of IFN-\u03bbs to induce antiproliferative activity in cells depends on the level of IFN-\u03bbR1 expression.\n\nIt has been recently reported that IFN-\u03bb signaling in colorectal adenocarcinoma HT29 cells led to caspase activation, externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS), and DNA fragmentation, resulting in subsequent apoptosis [38]. This study provided evidence for the first time that type III IFNs, alone or in combination with other stimuli, have the potential to induce apoptosis. Moreover, another recent study revealed that IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03bb differ in their antiproliferative effects and this was correlated with a difference in the duration of JAK/STAT signaling activity between the two IFNs and prolonged ISG expression upon IFN-\u03bb treatment [18]. Using the human keratinocyte HaCaT cell line that expresses receptors for both IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03bb, they found that IFN-\u03bb induced a more pronounced growth inhibitory effect than IFN-\u03b1. IFN-\u03bb was also more efficient than IFN-\u03b1 in inducing an antiproliferative effect that overlapped with the activation of apoptosis. Prolonged duration of IFN-\u03bb-induced STAT activation, and ISG expression could account for the enhanced antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects observed in HaCaT cells, effects not seen upon treatment with high doses of IFN-\u03b1 [18]. Interestingly, a study has shown that IFN-\u03bb can induce the growth of human multiple-myeloma cells and antagonize the dexamethasone-induced cell death in these cells [39]. IFN-\u03bb-mediated cell growth of multiple myeloma cells was MAPK dependent [39]. High level of IFN-\u03bb was found in the malignant bone marrow microenvironment, implying that IFN-\u03bb may play a direct role in multiple myeloma development.\n\nBy using a plasmid electrotransfer approach, Sommereyns and coworkers reported a differential response to IFN-\u03bb in mice, with a very low response to IFN-\u03bb for the liver, central nervous system, and spleen. However, a high response to IFN-\u03bb was observed in the stomach, intestine, heart, kidney, and lung [40]. The IFN-\u03bb response was restricted to epithelial cells and correlated with the expression of IFN-\u03bbR (IL-28Ralpha). Paradoxically in mice, in spite of the epithelial nature of the hepatocytes, the liver expressed low levels of IL-28Ralpha and responded poorly to IFN-\u03bb [8, 40]. However, a significant response to IFN-\u03bb was reported in human hepatocytes [13, 32], suggesting the existence of some variations in the response to IFN-\u03bb between mice and humans, at least in the liver. Although the main IFN-\u03bb targets are the epithelial cells, the presence of potential tissue-specific factors may modulate the IFN-\u03bb response through the IFN-\u03bb receptors. Recently, it has been shown in mice that in contrast to the hepatocytes, prominent response to IFN-\u03bb was observed in intestinal epithelial cells. In comparison with IFN-\u03b1, this response is higher and plays a critical role in protecting the intestinal epithelium from viral infection [41], strongly suggesting the prominent role of IFN-\u03bb in organs with mucosal surface at least in mice [6, 42, 43]. In addition to the direct effect of IFN-\u03bb on the mucosal epithelium, local immunomodulations can also be promoted [44].\n\nThe functional IFN-\u03bbR is formed by two chain proteins, IFN-\u03bbR1 (also called IL-28Ralpha) and IL-10R2. IFN-\u03bbR1 is unique for the IFN-\u03bbs, and its tissue distribution is highly restricted. In contrast to IFN-\u03bbR1, IL-10R2 is shared by IL-10, IL-22 and IL-26 and ubiquitously expressed in all tissues. Unlike IFN-\u03b1, only few cell types respond to IFN-\u03bb (Figure 2). In contrast to the epithelial-like cells, fibroblasts and endothelial cells were completely unresponsive to IFN-\u03bb [4]. Although the hematopoeitic system is not the primary target of IFN-\u03bb, the response of some subpopulations to IFN-\u03bb is not excluded. In mice, we found that IFN-\u03bb induces STAT1 activation in both plasmacytoid and myeloid dendritic cells [45]. These results are in accordance with those obtained by Mennechet and Uz\u00e9 [29], who proposed the acquisition of an IFN-\u03bb response by monocytes after their differentiation into dendritic cells. Therefore, the response to IFN-\u03bb may be controlled by the induction of the IFN-\u03bbR1 expression. Different levels of IFN-\u03bbR1 were found in different tissues [40, 43, 46]. The highest levels were found in the gastrointestinal tract and lung. The brain showed the lowest level of receptor expression. The IFN-\u03bbR1 expression was also analyzed in different cell types. The expression of cell populations isolated from human skin showed a high expression of IFN-\u03bbR1 in keratinocytes and melanocytes. However, dermal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and subdermal adipocytes did not express significant amounts of IFN-\u03bbR1. Significant expression of IFN-\u03bbR1 was detected in primary human hepatocytes in comparison with the chondrocytes, isolated from the hyaline cartilage of the knee joint [46, 47]. Although the expression of IFN-\u03bbR1 was significantly high in lymphoid tissues, the IFN-\u03bb response was very weak, implying the presence of specific mechanisms in the lymphoid tissues that may inhibit the IFN-\u03bb response. For example, IFN-\u03bbR1 levels in B cells are threefold those detected in keratinocytes, which exhibit one of the highest responses to IFN-\u03bb. Witte et al. proposed the potential role of soluble IFN-\u03bbR1, highly released by the immune cells, in this weak response to IFN-\u03bb [46].\n\nAlthough all the IFN-\u03bbs interact with the same receptor, IFN-\u03bbR1, the binding characteristics for each ligand are still under investigation. In the future, it will be important to analyze the IFN-\u03bb activity in light of the IFN-\u03bb binding to the cells and understand particularly the role of IFN-\u03bb3, which possesses the highest activity as compared with the other IFN-\u03bbs [48, 49]. Analysis of the ligand binding in combination with the activity induced by IFN-\u03bb will be also important in understanding the impact of IFN-\u03bb in epithelial cells, particularly in comparison with the immune cells expressing IFN-\u03bbR1. Besides several carcinomas, originating from epithelial cells, which respond to IFN-\u03bb, other tumors not arising from epithelial cells may become more sensitive to IFN-\u03bb. It was reported that multiple myeloma cells, which originate from B-cell plasmocytes, showed high binding and response to IFN-\u03bb [39]. Studying the IFN-\u03bb binding in transformed cells versus normal cells may be very helpful for tumor targeting and for the establishment of the optimum dose of IFN-\u03bb to be used for the in vivo treatment. IFN-\u03bb can also be used as a drug carrier, to specifically target a drug to tumors expressing high IFN-\u03bb binding sites.\n\nThe availability of IFN-\u03bbR1 knock-out mice allowed for the investigation of the role of type III IFNs in vivo. By using those mice, Mordstein et al. showed for the first time the contribution of IFN-\u03bb in the innate immunity against the influenza virus [8]. Later, they found that IFN-\u03bb played an important role in the defense against other pathogens that infect the respiratory tract, such as the respiratory syncitial virus, the metapneumovirus, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. However, the lassa fever virus which replicates in the liver, was not affected by the lack of IFN-\u03bbR1 [50]. Although this study clearly demonstrated that IFN-\u03bb played an important role in protecting the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts against virus infection, in comparison with type I IFN, the protection provided by type III IFN remains limited. However, in combination, type I and type III may provide a better viral protection. When the response to both type I and type III is deficient, the mice are not able to clear the SARS coronavirus from the intestine as compared with mice in which type I or type III remains functional, implying that IFN-\u03bb may strengthen the antiviral activity by acting as a first line of defense for the mucosa [8, 50].\n\nThe first use of IFN-\u03bb in the clinic has started for hepatitis C. The phase 1b study has been conducted in patients with chronic genotype 1 hepatitis C virus infection ((HCV) [51]). Pegylated IFN-\u03bb1 in combination or not with ribavirin (RBV, which belongs to a class of antiviral medications called the nucleoside analogues) has been used in this study to assess the efficacy and the potential cytotoxicity. The study was performed in 3 parts. The first part evaluated the pegylated IFN-\u03bb as single agent for relapsed patients after IFN-\u03b1-based treatment. The second part concerned the combination of pegylated IFN-\u03bb and RBV in treatment-relapse patients. The third part evaluated pegylated IFN-\u03bb in combination with RBV in treatment-na\u00efve patients. In addition, different doses (from 0.5 to 3 microg/kg) of pegylated IFN-\u03bb were used. Fifty-six patients were enrolled. 24, 25, and 7 patients were used, respectively, for part 1 to 3. The data showed an antiviral activity in all doses of pegylated IFN-\u03bb tested. 29% of treatment-na\u00efve patients achieved rapid antiviral response. As expected, due to the limited IFN-\u03bbR1 distribution, the treatment was well tolerated with few adverse effects. Minimal flu-like symptoms and limited hematologic suppression were reported. In summary, the authors concluded that weekly pegylated-IFN-\u03bb with or without daily RBV for 4 weeks is associated with a clear antiviral activity in patients with chronic HCV. However, this study lacks a direct comparison between IFN-\u03bb and IFN-\u03b1 and the influence of viral and patient genotypes. Now it is well accepted that the response to IFN-\u03b1 or the natural clearance of HCV infection is depending on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), upstream of IFN-\u03bb3, which could be used as biomarkers to help determine the treatment outcome [52]. The first genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in HCV infection were reported by Ge et al. They evaluated the treatment outcome in a group of 1671 patients of mixed ethnicity, receiving pegylated IFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin. An association was discovered between sustained viral response (SVR) to treatment and a cluster of seven SNPs linked to the IFN-\u03bb3 gene, with the most significant SNP (rs12979860) demonstrating high statistical significance [53]. Many other studies have replicated these findings, demonstrating the high link between IFN-\u03bb3 and treatment outcome [54\u201361]. However the mechanisms explaining this link remain to be determined. It is not clear yet if this SNP is associated with a constitutive production of IFN-\u03bb that may play a role in HCV clearance and the success of IFN-\u03b1 treatment. These results also suggest the therapeutic potential of the IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03bb combination therapy as demonstrated for the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mouse model [62].\n\nAlthough they engage distinct receptors, IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03bb induce similar cell signaling (Figure 1). Since IFN-\u03b1 is widely used in the clinic to treat cancer (Table 1), we have investigated the potential antitumor activity of IFN-\u03bb by using the mouse B16 melanoma model. We have chosen this cancer model because melanoma is a very aggressive cancer, and one of the therapeutic agents frequently used in the treatment of melanoma is IFN-\u03b1. Significant improvements in relapse-free and overall survival, with postoperative adjuvant IFN-\u03b1 therapy, have been reported by large and randomized studies [63\u201365]. However, the beneficial effect of IFN-\u03b1 was only obtained when the patients received high doses (20 MIU/m2 intravenously five times per week). Studies with low doses of IFN-\u03b1 have not shown significant increase in overall survival [66, 67]. Usually, the dose for optimal antitumor activity is higher than the maximally tolerated dose. This dose dilemma profoundly affects the acceptance of IFN-\u03b1 treatment by both the clinicians and the patients. The adverse effects associated with high doses of IFN-\u03b1 include myelosuppression and nervous system disorders. These effects often compromise the beneficial antitumor effect, with premature discontinuation of the treatment or the reduction of the dose of IFN-\u03b1. Since virtually all the cells of the body respond to IFN-\u03b1, it is not surprising that the patients develop numerous side effects. Making a dissection between the beneficial and harmful effects of IFN-\u03b1 is a very challenging task, which requires more investigation of the interferon system. To investigate the antitumor effect of IFN-\u03bb in melanoma, we have used a gene therapy approach, consisting on the delivery of the IFN-\u03bb gene to tumor cells. Gene transfer into tumor cells is very useful approach to test the effectiveness of cytokines in animal cancer models. This approach does not require production and purification of the protein. The secretion of constant amounts of various cytokines by transduced tumor cells at the site of tumor growth could elicit more effective antitumor responses by acting directly on the tumor microenvironment. Another advantage of the cytokine gene transfer into tumor cells versus systemic administration is the potential of inducing the antitumor effect without eliciting the side effects associated with the systemic administration of high doses of cytokines.\n\nTo investigate the potential antitumoral role of IFN-\u03bb, we first evaluated the response of B16 melanoma cells to IFN-\u03bb, by analyzing STAT1 activation and MHC class I antigen expression. In comparison with IFN-\u03b1, we have found that IFN-\u03bb induces weak STAT1 phosphorylation but strong stimulation of MHC class I antigen expression, indicating a difference between IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03bb in the link intensity of cell signaling/biological activity. This result warrants further investigation in comparing the response to IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03bb. By using gene transfer, we engineered B16 cells, which constitutively produced mIFN-\u03bb (B16.IFN-\u03bb cells). In response to their secretion of IFN-\u03bb, B16.IFN-\u03bb cells exhibited constitutively high levels of MHC class I antigen expression. All the C57BL/6 syngeneic mice injected with parental B16 cells developed tumors. However, the constitutive production of mIFN-\u03bb by B16.IFN-\u03bb cells markedly affected tumorigenicity of the cells. B16.IFN-\u03bb cells were either rejected by the host or grew at a slower rate than control parental B16 cells. The antitumor effect of IFN-\u03bb was dose dependent. B16.IFN-\u03bb cells also inhibited the growth of parental B16 cells when both cell types were injected together [4]. We also used the engineered B16.IFN-\u03bb Res. cells, which, in addition to their constitutive IFN-\u03bb secretion, are completely resistant to IFN-\u03bb, as demonstrated by the lack of IFN-\u03bb-induced MHC class I antigen expression. Interestingly, similar to B16.IFN-\u03bb cells, we have found a reduction of the tumorigenicity of B16.IFN-\u03bb Res. cells, implying the involvement of host antitumor mechanisms induced by IFN-\u03bb [4].\n\nFollowing our report on the characterization of the mouse IFN-\u03bb system and the potent antitumor activity of IFN-\u03bb in the B16 mouse melanoma model, independent groups confirmed the role of IFN-\u03bb as an antitumoral agent in melanoma and other tumor models. To demonstrate the antitumor activity of IFN-\u03bb, Sato et al. [68] used the mouse melanoma B16F0 and B16F10 and the Colon26 cell lines transfected with IFN-\u03bb2 cDNA. The IFN-\u03bb-transduced B16F0 cells showed an increased activity of caspase 3/7, an induction of p21 and a dephosphoryation of Rb, which triggered a cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. These events, obtained, in vitro, were apparently associated with a growth delay, observed in vivo after the injection of the B16F0 transduced with IFN-\u03bb. A delay in tumor growth was also observed after the administration of the Colon26 cells transduced with IFN-\u03bb. By using the B16F10 cell line, which represents metastatic mouse melanoma cells, the authors showed that the overexpression of IFN-\u03bb significantly inhibited lung metastasis. In another study, to evaluate the antitumor activity of IFN-\u03bb, Numasaki et al. [69] first transduced the mouse fibrosarcoma cells, MCA2005, with the retroviral vector PA317IL-28 (IFN-\u03bb2). Following the injection of the engineered tumor cells to mice, the authors observed a significant antitumor and antimetastatic effect in mice inoculated with the MCA2005IL-28 in comparison with those injected with the parental tumor cells.\n\nHCC is the most prevalent type of liver cancer. It is the fifth most common solid tumor and the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. It is also the second most lethal cancer with the five-year survival rate below 9% [70\u201372]. Treatment options for HCC are limited mainly because of the inefficiency of existing anticancer chemotherapeutic drugs against HCC. Unfortunately, due to a lack of biomarkers and screening for HCC, most patients are diagnosed at advanced stages of the disease and do not meet strict selection criteria for potentially curative surgical tumor resection or orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) [73\u201375]. In patients with unresectable HCC and preserved liver function, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been shown to prolong survival. However TACE is rarely curative, and progression-free survival beyond 24 months is not frequent [71, 76]. For patients with advanced disease, systemic chemotherapy is of limited benefit because of the resistance of HCC to existing anticancer drugs and the fact that about 50% of patients with HCC die secondary to liver failure from cirrhosis [77, 78]. HCC occurs most frequently in patients with cirrhosis as a result of chronic HBV (hepatitis B virus) and HCV (hepatitis C virus) infections, and alcohol abuse [72, 79]. Although the link between the cancer and the viral infection is not fully understood yet, there is some suggestion that viral infection interferes with signal transduction and consequently disrupts the normal, controlled growth of cells.\n\nSince IFN-\u03b1 is used in the clinic for the treatment of chronic HCV and HBV infections, several studies evaluated the effect of IFN treatment on the incidence of HCC [72]. It was previously shown that the systemic administration of high doses and long-term IFN-\u03b1 into nude mice bearing human HCC with high metastatic potential, following curative resection, inhibited tumor metastatis and recurrence [80]. The majority of clinical studies also concluded that IFN therapy, alone or in combination with ribavirin, decreased the incidence of HCC, particularly in patients with sustained virological response [81\u201384]. Therefore, IFN alone or, perhaps, in combination with other drugs can be used as a preventive therapy against the development of HCC in HCV- and HBV-infected patients. However, numerous side effects limit the overall tolerability of IFN-\u03b1, particularly in patients with cirrhosis [85\u201387].\n\nIn the following part of this section, we describe our findings on the antitumor properties of IFN-\u03bb in the BNL mouse model of HCC. To evaluate the antitumor activities of both IFN-\u03bb and IFN-\u03b1, we used a gene therapy approach as previously described [4]. We expressed IFN-\u03bb and IFN-\u03b1 genes under a strong constitutive promoter in BNL cells and selected stable cell lines, BNL-IFN-\u03bb and BNL-IFN-\u03b1, constitutively expressing IFN-\u03bb and IFN-\u03b1 [45]. Since the constitutive expression of IFN-\u03bb at the tumor site was found to affect the tumorigenicity of B16 melanoma cells in vivo [4], we examined whether similar effects of IFN-\u03bb would be displayed in the case of BNL hepatoma. Mice injected with BNL vector or parental BNL cells developed tumors in 4 to 6 weeks, whereas the tumor appearance for BNL-IFN-\u03bb cells was significantly delayed. Similar effects were obtained in mice inoculated with BNL-IFN-\u03b1 cells. These experiments demonstrated that constitutive expression of IFNs at the tumor site resulted in the delay of tumor growth in vivo. Interestingly, we found that IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03bb exhibited similar antitumor activities [45].\n\nDespite the antiproliferative effects of IFN-\u03b1, it seems that the direct effects on tumor cells may not be the major mechanism by which IFN-\u03b1 displays its antitumor activity. IFN-\u03b1 can act indirectly on the tumor by inhibiting angiogenesis which is induced by the tumors and is required to promote their growth and metastasis [88]. In mice bearing human tumors, it was clearly demonstrated that the antitumor activity of IFN-\u03b1 is associated with the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis in bladder carcinoma [89] and prostate cancer [90]. The involvement of the immune system in the antitumor mechanism of IFN-\u03b1 was strongly suggested by Gresser et al. [91, 92]. Early studies in tumor models have shown that an intact immune system was essential in IFN-\u03b1-induced antitumor activities. The inhibition of Friend leukemia cells (FLC) by IFN-\u03b1 in mice was shown to depend on the activation of host cells, such as NK cells and macrophages [92]. Both host humoral and cellular immune mechanisms were involved in the continued suppression of Friend erythroleukemia metastases after IFN-\u03b1 treatment in mice [91]. In addition, effective adaptive immunotherapy was observed in a T-cell lymphoma model, after the injection of tumor-sensitized spleen cells and IFN-\u03b1. By using antibodies against different immune cell populations, it has been shown that CD4+ T lymphocytes and CD8+ T lymphocytes were the major effectors in the antitumor activities induced by IFN-\u03b1 [93, 94]. \n\nAlthough IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03bb signal quite similarly (Figure 1), the mechanisms underlying the antitumor activity of IFN-\u03bb may be qualitatively different from IFN-\u03b1. As previously described, we initially investigated whether type III IFNs also possessed antitumor activities utilizing a gene therapy approach in the B16 melanoma model. Since secreted IFN-\u03bb did not affect the proliferation rate of B16 melanoma cells in vitro, studies in the B16 melanoma model suggested that IFN-\u03bb acted through host mechanisms to elicit its antitumor activity [4]. However, we did not observe a significant long-lasting immunity, implying that there may be a lack of effective adaptive immunity in the mice which rejected the tumor. On the other hand, we noticed a reduction in tumor vascularity in the presence of IFN-\u03bb, suggesting a potential role of IFN-\u03bb in the tumor microenvironment [4]. Since we found that keratinocytes are highly sensitive to IFN-\u03bb and they are known to interact with melanocytes, the cells from which the melanoma originates, we suggested that IFN-\u03bb delivery to the tumor microenvironment may affect the function of the keratinocytes as well as other stroma cells thereby promoting inhibition of tumor growth [4]. NK cells, the major effectors of innate immunity, could also be recruited to the tumor microenvironment and help destroy the tumor cells. Two groups have reported that NK cells played a role in the antitumor mechanisms of IFN-\u03bb. Sato et al. [68] have described the involvement of NK cells in melanoma and colon cancer antitumor responses. They have shown that transient transduction of B16 cells with mouse IFN-\u03bb cDNA enhanced MHC class I and Fas expression, suppressed cell proliferation by inducing increased caspase-3/7 activity, increased p21Waf1/Cip1 levels, and dephosphorylated Rb (Ser780) in vitro [68]. This meant that IFN-\u03bb was able to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death in vitro. In addition, they have demonstrated that overexpression of IFN-\u03bb inhibited local and pulmonary metastatic tumor formation in vivo. Depletion of NK cells, by injecting an anti-asialo GM1 antibody before tumor cells injection, revealed that NK cells are important in this IFN-\u03bb-mediated tumor growth inhibition in vivo, suggesting that IFN-\u03bb activated the innate immune response [68]. Numasaki et al. [69] have also implicated NK cells, polymorphonuclear neutrophils, and CD8+ T cells in the antitumoral activity are induced by IFN-\u03bb in the MCA205 murine fibrosarcoma mouse model. Inoculation of MCA205-IFN-\u03bb cells into mice enhanced IFN-\u03b3 production and cytotoxic T-cell activity in the spleen. The antitumor activity of IFN-\u03bb was partially dependent on IFN-\u03b3. In addition, IFN-\u03bb increased the total number of splenic NK cells in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, enhanced IL-12-induced IFN-\u03b3 production in vivo, and expanded spleen cells in C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, they reported that IL-12 augmented the IFN-\u03bb-mediated antitumor activity in the presence or absence of IFN-\u03b3. Based on their findings, they suggested that IFN-\u03bb is able to induce both innate and adaptive immune responses to suppress in vivo tumor growth [69].\n\nOur recent study in the BNL hepatoma model also revealed that NK cells are implicated in the antitumor activity induced by IFN-\u03bb and probably more potently than IFN-\u03b1. However, in contrast to IFN-\u03b1, we did not detect any response after in vitro treatment of NK cells by IFN-\u03bb, suggesting that IFN-\u03bb may activate other cells, which then mediate NK cell activation [45]. There was also a marked NK cell infiltration in IFN-\u03bb-producing tumors. In addition, IFN-\u03bb and, to a lesser extent, IFN-\u03b1 enhanced immunocytotoxicity of splenocytes primed with irradiated BNL cells. Splenocyte cytotoxicity against BNL cells was dependent on IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 and mediated by dendritic cells. In contrast to NK cells, isolated from spleen, CD11c+ and mPDCA+ dendritic cells responded directly to IFN-\u03bb, suggesting that the effects of IFN-\u03bb on NK cells are mediated by other IFN-\u03bb-responsive cells, such as DCs [45]. On the other hand, a significant decrease in CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs was observed in mice inoculated with BNL cells secreting IFN-\u03b1, whereas the moderate decrease in Tregs observed in mice receiving BNL cells secreting IFN-\u03bb was not statistically significant [45]. Therefore, antitumor mechanisms activated by IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03bb may differ; IFN-\u03bb increased the number of NK cells at the tumor site whereas IFN-\u03b1 had a stronger effect on Tregs in the BNL model.\n\nThese studies altogether suggest that although IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03bb signal quite similarly, differences exist in their biological potency, kinetics, and the sets of target cells sensitive to IFN-\u03bb and IFN-\u03b1. Therefore, these two types of IFNs may have distinct physiological functions.\n\nUnlike IFN-\u03b1, only a small subset of cells are sensitive to IFN-\u03bb, implying that its potential clinical use may be associated with limited side effects. This presumption raises the question whether IFN-\u03bb could be an alternative to IFN-\u03b1 in cancer therapy. However, despite the severe and numerous side effects inherent to IFN-\u03b1 treatment [65], we believe that alternative treatment to IFN-\u03b1 should be weighed first against the real benefits to patients in terms of overall survival and their tumor clearance. We have demonstrated in the BNL hepatoma model that the combination of IFN-\u03bb and IFN-\u03b1 could achieve a marked antitumor activity in comparison with the use of each IFN alone [62]. The benefits of the combination therapy of IFN-\u03bb and IFN-\u03b1 have been demonstrated both by using a gene therapy approach and by direct administration of IFNs to the mice bearing the tumors. The mice injected with BNL cells secreting both IFN-\u03bb and IFN-\u03b1 can completely reject the tumor, in contrast to the mice that only received the BNL-IFN-\u03bb cells or the BNL-IFN-\u03b1 cells. Furthermore, mice bearing established tumors and treated with exogenous IFN-\u03bb and IFN-\u03b1 showed a drastic tumor repression. This effect was observed when the IFNs were delivered locally and even at low doses. Therefore, we believe that IFN-\u03bb is not simply acting like IFN-\u03b1, with reduced side effects, but can be combined with IFN-\u03b1 to achieve efficient antitumor activity. Combination of IFN-\u03bb with low doses of IFN-\u03b1, which are subtherapeutic but less toxic [67], may improve IFN therapy and benefit cancer patients. Combinational therapy of IFN-\u03bb and IFN-\u03b1 may achieve ultimate antitumor activity by inducing complementary mechanisms directly on the tumor cells or by indirectly modulating the tumor microenvironment, thereby leading to the stimulation of the immune response against the tumor and the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. By acting with different intensities on the same targets, IFN-\u03bb and IFN-\u03b1 may generate a high level of synergy, leading to a potent antitumor activity.\n\nSimilarly to IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03bb has been shown to play an important role in cancer and viral disease treatment. Although the two IFNs act through an identical signaling pathway in the cell, the pattern of their activity seems to be different in vivo, implying that IFN-\u03bb and IFN-\u03b1 are not redundant cytokines. By acting on some targets with different intensities, we believe that IFN-\u03bb and IFN-\u03b1 act in concert to better control tumor development in vivo. Therefore, to achieve better treatments for viral diseases or cancers, we believe that the development of a combination therapy rather than the use of each IFN alone will be more beneficial for the patients. The combination of IFNs with other cytokines, growth factors, or their antagonists could also be an important strategy for the improvement of the IFN therapy. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF\u03b2) which plays a dual role in cancer, mediating tumor-suppresive activities at early stages and prooncogenic activities at later stages of tumor progression [95, 96], could represent one potentially important modulator or mediator of the IFN response. Understanding the potential crosstalks between IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03bb and other cytokines or growth factors, such as TGF\u03b2, could be rewarding and lead to new preclinical studies in animal models and new clinical trials resulting in better cancer treatments."}
