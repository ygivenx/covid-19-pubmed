{"title": "Article history: Risk of Water and Food-Borne Communicable Diseases in Travelers Entering Korea", "body": "The major communicable diseases that have been reported to the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) are dengue fever, malaria, hepatitis A, shigellosis and Zika virus [7] . In recent times, the number of cases of shigellosis (a Category 1 in Communicable Diseases Prevention Act), is increasing. The incidence rate of shigellosis is high among travelers from Southeast Asia such as Vietnam, Philippines, and India [8] .\n\nAmong 192 cases of shigellosis reported to the KCDC in 2018, 146 cases (76.0%) had been infected from abroad. This means that there has been a 2.1-fold increase in cases from the 69 cases of shigellosis reported in 2017 [9] . The number of water and food-borne (WFB) communicable diseases (such as shigellosis, cholera, typhoid, paratyphoid, Enterohemorrhagic E. there were 159 cases reported, which was 3.4-times higher than the number of cases reported in the previous year [10] .\n\nUsing data from the quarantine information system in KCDC, this study surveyed the health status of travelers entered Korea who were quarantined during 2013 to 2017 because they had symptoms of communicable disease. The incidence status and its related factors of overseas WFB communicable diseases were analyzed. \n\nIn this study, cases of fever, diarrhea and respiratory symptoms among people quarantined within the period 2013-2017 were confirmed. Causative agents of WFB communicable disease were determined using laboratory tests at the point of entry and related factors affecting gastrointestinal WFB communicable diseases were analyzed. Table 1 ). countries [12, 13] . Travelers' diarrhea is a symptom of eating infected food and to a lesser extent drinking unclean water [14, 15] . Globally, 30-70% of travelers experience diarrhea during travel, and usually have bacterial pathogens such as E. coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella spp., and Salmonella spp.\n\nThese are major causes of diarrhea symptoms in travelers [16, 17] . \n\nThe authors have no conflicts of interest to declare."}
