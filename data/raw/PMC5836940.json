{"title": "Comparison of three multiplex PCR assays for detection of respiratory viruses: Anyplex II RV16, AdvanSure RV, and Real\u2010Q RV\n", "body": "Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are one of the major causes of mortality worldwide and approximately half of ARI are caused by respiratory viruses (RV).1 There are several types of tests for detection of RV. Among them, the nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) has widely been accepted in recent years.2 NAAT has advantages in comparison to the classical methods of viral culture and direct fluorescent antibody tests. First, NAAT has superior sensitivity identifying RV cases not detected by classical methods. Second, RV testing results are available faster than those of viral cultures. Speed to result allows medical professionals to prescribe antiviral agents and perform appropriate infection control more rapidly. Lastly, NAAT does not need a strict transportation protocol for maintaining viability of RV.3 In addition, the application of multiplexing technology in NAAT allows better detection than classical methods of a broad range of viruses. For all of these reasons NAAT has replaced classical methods.\n\nThere are a number of commercial multiplex kits that can detect between 12 and 23 virus types.3, 4 Performance evaluation studies for newly developed multiplex RV kits are weak, do not establish the reference standard method and therefore do not sufficiently calculate sensitivity and specificity of each test. Instead, some studies have suggested the reference test with in\u2010house multiplex real\u2010time PCR or commercial duplex PCR tests.5, 6, 7, 8 We performed a direct comparison of three commercial multiplex assays and produced the values of the agreement and kappa instead of sensitivity and specificity with the reference tests. The objective of this study was to perform a direct comparison of three multiplex RT\u2010PCR assays for the detection of respiratory viruses.\n\nRespiratory samples used in this study were collected between December 2015 and March 2016 at Armed Forces Medical Research Institute and Armed Forces Daejeon hospital (Daejeon, Republic of Korea) from those submitted for the detection of respiratory viruses. Clinical samples from 201 young male soldiers (age range 18\u201027 years, median 21 years) with acute respiratory illness were randomly selected for study without knowledge of previous results from Real\u2010Q RV or Anyplex II RV16 tests. They consisted of nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples (n=161) and sputum samples (n=40) and were stored at \u221270\u00b0C until this study was conducted.\n\nNasopharyngeal swab samples were obtained using flocked swabs and transported in 3 mL universal transport medium (COPAN Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA, USA). Sputum samples were received in sterile plastic containers and treated in order to homogenize samples using a 1:1 ratio dithiothreitol, which was diluted 1:100 with distilled water because of it viscosity. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Armed Forces Medical Command (AFMC\u201016\u2010IRB\u2010023).\n\nThe nucleic acid extraction system was used for each RV assay. For Anyplex II RV 16 (AP), nucleic acids were extracted from 500 \u03bcL of clinical samples using a MICROLAB Nimbus IVD workstation (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA) with a STARMag 96 Virus Kit (Seegene, Seoul, Republic of Korea) and eluted into 80 \u03bcL of elution buffer. For AdvanSure RV real\u2010time PCR (AD), nucleic acids were extracted from 200 \u03bcL of clinical samples using the TANBead Smart LabAssist\u201032 extraction system with a TANBead Viral Auto Plate kit (Taiwan Advanced Nanotech Inc., Taoyuan City, Taiwan) and eluted into 80 \u03bcL of elution buffer. For Real\u2010Q RV Detection assay (RQ), nucleic acids were extracted from 200 \u03bcL of clinical samples using a Maxwell\u2122 16 device with the Maxwell 16 Viral Total Nucleic Acid Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and eluted into 80 \u03bcL of elution buffer.\n\nThree commercial multiplex RV assays were performed based on manufacturers\u2019 protocols. Characteristics of the three multiplex assays are briefly reported in Table 1. The AP assay is composed of two\u2010step RT\u2010PCR. Before multiplex target PCR was performed, complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from each sample's RNA through reverse transcriptase (RT) reaction with the cDNA Synthesis kit (Seegene). The mixture for CDNA synthesis is a 20 \u03bcL final volume, including 8 \u03bcL of the sample's nucleic acid, 8 \u03bcL of RT buffer, 2 \u03bcL of the RT enzyme Mix and 2 \u03bcL of random Hexamer with Veriti Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) under the following conditions: 25\u00b0C for 5 minutes, 37\u00b0C for 60 minutes and 95\u00b0C for 2 minutes. After cDNA synthesis, the 16 target viruses were multiplexed into two tubes according to target primer and probe. Multiplex real\u2010time PCR was conducted in a 20 \u03bcL mixture containing 8 \u03bcL of cDNA, 5 \u03bcL of 4X TOCE Oligo Mix primer, 5 \u03bcL of 4X PCR master mix, and 2 \u03bcL of RNase\u2010free water with the CFX96 Real\u2010time PCR detection system (Bio\u2010rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The thermal cycling conditions were: 50\u00b0C for 4 minutes; denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 minutes followed by 50 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 60\u00b0C for 1 minutes and 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds. During the interval of the 50 cycles, melting temperature analysis was conducted by cooling the mixture to 55\u00b0C and maintaining for 15 seconds followed by heating the mixture from 55\u00b0C to 85\u00b0C (0.5\u00b0C/5 seconds) after 30, 40, and 50 cycles respectively. The fluorescence was continually detected during heating process and the data were converted to derive the melting temperature by plotting the negative derivative of fluorescence vs temperature (\u2212dF/dT against T). Seegene viewer software can automatically interpret melting peaks derived and present the results as \u2018+, ++, and +++ positive\u2019 according to detection cycles of melting temperature analysis or \u2018negative.\u2019 Bacteriophage MS2 as an Internal Control (IC) was added to clinical specimens before nucleic acid extraction and was incorporated into the product as an exogenous whole process control in order to monitor during the period of time between nucleic acid isolation to result interpretation. The IC was co\u2010amplified with the target nucleic acids within the clinical specimens.\n\nThe AD assay performs both reverse\u2010transcription(RT) reaction with the extracted RNA from specimen and multiplex PCR reaction simultaneously in a single tube (1\u2010step RT\u2010PCR). It uses human RNase P gene, as an internal control, to give information for validity of the RNA extraction procedure and to prevent misjudgment from sampling error and RT\u2010PCR reaction error. Briefly, the assay was multiplexed into five tubes targeting 14 RVs and an IC gene. This was conducted in a 20 \u03bcL mixture containing 5 \u03bcL of nucleic acid, 5 \u03bcL of primer/probe mixture and 10 \u03bcL of RT\u2010PCR premix with the SLAN Real\u2010time PCR detection system (Shanghai Hongshi Medical Technology Co., Shanghai, China). The thermal cycling conditions for the RT step were: 50\u00b0C for 10 minutes and 95\u00b0C for 30 seconds followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds; 53\u00b0C for 30 seconds and 60\u00b0C for 30 seconds.\n\nThe RQ assay is also a one\u2010step RT\u2010 PCR method. Briefly, the assay was multiplexed into five tubes targeting 14 RVs and 1 IC gene, which was human RNase P, like in the AD assay. RQ was conducted in a 22 \u03bcL mixture containing 5 \u03bcL of nucleic acid, 12.5 \u03bcL of 2X PCR reaction mixture, 1 \u03bcL of RT\u2010PCR enzyme, and 3.5 \u03bcL of water with CFX96 Real\u2010time PCR detection system (Bio\u2010rad). The RT\u2010PCR reaction was performed with the following conditions for the RT step: 50\u00b0C for 30 minutes; 95\u00b0C for 15 minutes, followed by 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds and 62\u00b0C for 45 seconds.\n\nA flow diagram of discrepant analysis is described in Figure 1. In summary, 167 samples (83.1%) with positive results from at least two RV assays or negative results from all three assays were not tested with the additional assay. However, the other 34 samples (16.9%), containing 36 discordant results showing a single positive result in any assay, were tested with the following additional assay. A single positive result from AP and RQ assay was retested individually with RV assay. Whereas a single positive result from AD assay was performed with monoplex PCR followed by direct sequencing. If the results between the original and additional tests were concordant, they were considered to be a consensus of positive results. Conversely, if the results between original and additional tests showed a discordance, they were considered to be a negative consensus. Because both AD and RQ assay cannot detect PIV4 and EV, the results about PIV4 and EV were excluded from the discrepant analysis.\n\nStatistical methods of inter\u2010rater agreement, including percent agreement and kappa statistics, were calculated to compare the three RV assays. In addition, prevalence\u2010adjusted and bias\u2010adjusted kappa (PABAK) was calculated to compensate for underestimation of kappa values caused by low prevalence of each respiratory type.9 The kappa value can be interpreted as follows: <0.20 as poor; 0.21\u20100.40 as fair; 0.41\u20100.6 as moderate; 0.61\u20100.8 as good and 0.81\u20101 as very good agreement.10 Statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) and MedCalc version 14.8.1 (MedCalc, Mariakerke, Belgium).\n\nStatistical analysis using percent agreement between RV assays in each virus type were high, ranging from 94% to 100%. Overall agreement between three RV assays ranged from 97% to 98%. The total kappa values were 0.76 between AP and AD, 0.82 between AP and RQ, and 0.86 between AD and RQ respectively. The kappa values ranged from 0.49 for PIV (AP vs AD and AD vs RQ) to 1.0 for PIV (AP vs RQ). In addition, PABAK values, which were adopted to compensate for the underestimation of kappa value when viruses show at a low prevalence rate, demonstrated very good agreement with ranges from 0.88 to 1.0 in comparison with kappa values.11 Table 2 shows the above results.\n\nA total of 167 samples (83.1%) showed concordant results. There was a total of 34 samples with a single positive result by one of the RV assays and two of these samples had discrepant results of two viruses. The 34 samples included 36 discordant results, 16, 18, and 2 viruses were positive only by AP, AD, and RQ respectively. Eighteen of the 36 discordant results from AP and RQ were resolved by repeat testing, with AD by monoplex PCR followed by direct sequencing. For the 36 discrepant virus results, additional testing revealed that 18.8% (3/16), 55.6% (10/18), and 50.0% (1/2) were consistent with the original virus result of AP, AD, and RQ assays respectively. These results were considered positive (Table 3).\n\nOf the 201 samples, AP, AD, and RQ detected 103 (51.2%), 99 (49.3%), and 95 (47.3%) positive cases respectively (Table 4). Viral co\u2010infection samples were identified in AP assay for 24 (11.9%) patients, in AD assay for 17 (8.5%) patients, and in RQ assay for 11 (5.5%) patients. In the co\u2010infected samples: two viruses were detected in 24 patients by AP assay; two viruses were detected in 14 patients and three viruses in three patients by AD assay; two viruses were detected in 11 patients by RQ assay. INF A was the most commonly detected virus by co\u2010infected samples, followed by ADV, RSVB, MPV and etc. Overall distribution of respiratory viruses from 3 RV assays is presented in Table 4. There are indications of the predominance of INFA, ADV, HRV, and MPV. Excluding these four major types, the rest of RV types accounted for only 0.8% to 8.9% of total viruses identified.\n\nThe current study was performed for direct comparison between commercial multiplex RT\u2010PCR for detection of respiratory viruses. A high degree agreement was found between AP, AD, and RQ assays. The agreement between 3 assays for INF A, INF B, PIV, CoV, HRV, MPV, RSV, and ADV ranged from 94% to 100% (Table 2). The agreement for PIV demonstrated the highest percent ranges, between 99% and 100%. While the kappa values varied according to virus types detected, PIV between AD vs AP and RQ was the lowest value (\u03ba=0.49). This result was caused by low frequency of PIV in samples making them eligible for PABAK. The value of PABAK increased to 0.98. RSV between AP vs AD and RQ show a low kappa value; however, PABAK for RSV did not show a sharp increase as seen with PIV because of the number of discrepant results between three assays.\n\nIn real circumstances of a clinical laboratory, the introduction of multiplex RT\u2010PCR assay for detection of RV was considered based on the assay's performance data and user friendliness.2, 3, 12 The assay characteristics of 3 RV assays related to end\u2010users was briefly summarized in Table 1. AP assay can detect 16 virus types and AD and RQ assays can detect 14 virus types. According to our study, the AP assay can test 40 samples in a single run whereas AD and RQ assay can simultaneously test 16 samples per run. However, the AP assay required the longest turn\u2010around time compared with other assays: 4.5 hours for the AP assay vs 2 hours for both the AD and RQ assays. In addition, the AP assay consisted of two steps, reverse transcription for cDNA synthesis and real\u2010time PCR coupled melting temperature analysis. As such it required end\u2010users to spend more hands\u2010on time to handle the reagents than other assays did. To overcome the time\u2010consuming step in the AP assay, an automated liquid handling system of mixing and handling reagents for PCR mater mix setup could be automated using MICROLAB Nimbus IVD (Hamilton). The characteristics between AD and RQ assays were very similar. Both AD and RQ assays were used based on TaqMan probe and 1\u2010step multiplex RT\u2010PCR combined with reverse transcription followed by real\u2010time PCR in a closed system. The test result of all assays was automatically presented by free analysis software offered from each company. The selection of multiplex RT\u2010PCR assay for RV detection requires consideration of each laboratory's facility, human resources and the number of tests.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge there is no study that compares Anyplex II RV16, AdvanSure RV, and Real\u2010Q RV in young adult patients with acute respiratory illness. Among the three assays, performance evaluation of AP assay was discussed in a number of articles. A first evaluation of AP assay against a combined standard of AP, xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel and Seeplex RV15 reported 95.2% sensitivity and \u226598.6% specificity rate.13 About the same time, Cho et al.14 reported that the performance of AP was superior in comparison with viral culture and Seeplex RV15. Huh et al.15 analyzed agreement between AP and Seeplex RV12 without standard method and found that the AP assay produced an equivalent performance against Seeplex RV12. The result of present study also showed that AP assay produced good agreements in performance comparable with AD and RQ assay in performance. In a previous study, AD showed good agreement (98%) against conventional multiplex RT\u2010PCR.16 Similarly, the performance evaluation of AD vis\u2010\u00e0\u2010vis a composite standard method revealed the most sensitive performance compared with viral culture and Seeplex RV15.17 The performance study of RQ assay was not found in the pubmed database, but evaluation of a previous version (1\u2010step RV real\u2010time PCR) against direct sequencing as a standard method reported 94.1% sensitivity and 96.6% specificity.18 We demonstrated that the agreement between three assays was excellent. Moreover, the end\u2010user in clinical laboratories selecting the multiplexed RT\u2010PCR for RV will need to consider the benefits of each assay in terms of both performance and user\u2010friendliness.\n\nIn the analysis of discrepant samples, 18.8% (3/16) from AP, 55.6% (10/18) from AD, and 50.0% (1/2) from RQ were consistent with the original virus results (Table 3). Of note, when repeat AP assay was done all RSVB samples (n=11) with an initial positive result by single AP identified as negative. Original test results of these samples were presented as + positive as detected by a melting temperature analysis after 50 cycles because they were supposed to contain low virus concentration. Unfortunately, the manufacturing company does not provide target range for virus detection and discloses that AP is a qualitative test for the detection of RV.\n\nLikewise, samples of CoV 229E identified as positive by single AD assay identified as negative (80%, 4/5) from result of monoplex PCR followed by direct sequencing. Negative samples had a high C\nt (threshold cycle) value (mean\u00b1SD, 25.17\u00b11.19) close to 27.0 as a cut\u2010off value, whereas one identified as positive using AD assay had a low C\nt value (23.1). These findings suggest that the discordant results were frequently reported in samples containing low viral copy. Other studies also indicated that discrepant results between RV assay was quite associated with sample's viral load.7, 8, 19, 20, 21 One samples by AP and three samples by AD identified as INF A positive by additional testing. This may be caused by the difference of target region in influenza genome in each assay. Other studies also indicated that detection ability of the influenza virus between commercial RV assay was varied according to subtype.22, 23 Unfortunately, we did not perform the Influenza A subtyping on targeted discrepant samples so any assay in this study cannot differentiate between subtypes of INF A. Further evaluation of performance between assay with regard to influenza A subtype is needed.\n\nThere were some limitations to this study. First, this study used samples from only young adults for a winter season. Thus, we could not obtain adequate samples per target virus, such as PIV type 1\u20104, CoV 229E, OC43 and NL63, and RSV A. Those viruses could not be subjected to measure agreement values for each target due to low numbers. Second, another limitation was the use of stored frozen samples. This could skew results of RV detection based on storage conditions and the defrosting procedure. However, since all specimens were stored at the same storage condition and were processed by one skilled technician, we presume that comparison results between three assays was not significantly influenced by this characteristic of the sample.\n\nIn conclusion, the agreement of the three assays were very good, with 94%\u2010100% agreement for all comparisons. We suggest that all multiplex assay would be suitable for the detection of for respiratory viruses in clinical setting."}
