{"title": "The role of phagocytic cells in enhanced susceptibility of broilers to colibacillosis after Infectious Bronchitis Virus infection", "body": "Predisposition for bacterial infections in the course of respiratory viral infections is found in various species, both avian and mammalian. In chickens, turkeys and ducks colibacillosis is often observed secondary to infection with respiratory agents e.g. Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV), Newcastle Disease Virus, and Mycoplasma gallisepticum (Igbokwe et al., 1996; Nakamura et al., 1994) . In mice, influenza virus www.elsevier.com/locate/vetimm increases susceptibility to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection (Seki et al., 2004; Speshock et al., 2007) and measles virus predisposes for a range of bacterial infections such as Listeria monocytogenes (Slifka et al., 2003) . In cattle, susceptibility for pneumonic pasteurellosis is greatly enhanced by a variety of respiratory viruses including bovine respiratory syncytial virus (Liu et al., 1999) , bovine herpes virus-1 (Leite et al., 2002) and bovine coronavirus (Storz et al., 2000) . In man, pneumonia has been a leading cause of death during influenza pandemics, supporting the widely held view that influenza virus predisposes for streptococcal infections (McCullers, 2006) .\n\nThe mechanisms behind enhanced susceptibility to bacterial superinfection after viral infection have been studied extensively (Beadling and Slifka, 2004; Hament et al., 1999) but are still not well understood. A first set of hypotheses suggests increased susceptibility due to tissue damage in the respiratory tract resulting in functional impairment. Three possible causes have been described as mechanisms for functional damage. Viral replication in the upper respiratory tract causes loss of cilia and ciliated cells (Bakaletz, 1995) , decreased ciliary activity impairs mucociliary clearance (Wilson et al., 1996) and finally, damage to epithelium may provide more attachment sites for bacteria (Ahmer et al., 1999) .\n\nA second set of hypotheses suggests altered innate immune responses. Impairment of innate effector functions, i.e. adhesion and entry, phagocytosis, killing, nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide production have been suggested previously (Ficken et al., 1987; Naqi et al., 2001; Read et al., 1999) . Changes in recruitment or function of macrophages and neutrophils after bacterial superinfections have been described in mice (Navarini et al., 2006; Slifka et al., 2003) .\n\nModulation of other innate functions affecting induction and/or control of adaptive responses might have a long term effect upon the host-pathogen interaction. Type I interferons (IFNs I) induced after viral infection have an antiviral effect, but can be detrimental for induction of anti-bacterial responses (Navarini et al., 2006; O'Connell et al., 2004) , whereas type II IFNs play an important role in bacterial infections (Shtrichman and Samuel, 2001) . Goren (1978) developed an experimental model in broilers that demonstrated enhanced susceptibility to Escherichia coli after inoculation with IBV. Moreover, not only a virulent strain (IBV M41) enhanced inflammatory reactions on superinfection with E. coli, but the mild IBV vaccine strain (IBV H120) widely used in the field also enhanced susceptibility in a very similar way (Matthijs et al., 2003) .\n\nIn our study to investigate which mechanisms underlie enhanced susceptibility to colibacillosis after IBV infection or vaccination, we examined the dynamics of pathogens and of immunopathological changes (Matthijs et al., accepted for publication) .\n\nThe aim of this study was to detect whether innate effector functions such as the recruitment of effector cells and function of phagocytic cells, measured by NO production and bactericidal capacity, had been affected after IBV infection. As an alternative explanation for the enhanced colibacillosis we also examined altered expression of cytokine mRNA in spleen and lung samples.\n\nEighteen-day-incubated eggs originating from a Mycoplasma gallisepticum-free broiler parent (Cobb) flock were obtained from a commercial hatchery and hatched at the research facility of the Department of Farm Animal Health (Utrecht University). From day of hatch (day 1), broilers were housed in negative pressure HEPA isolators (Beyer and Eggelaar, Utrecht, The Netherlands) each with a volume of 0.68 m 3 and fitted with a wire floor of 0.93 m 2 . Isolators were ventilated at a rate of approximately 40 m 3 h \u00c01 . Broilers were fed a commercial ration containing 12.4 MJ of metabolically energy per kg and 19.5% crude protein ad libitum, but from day 14 onwards feed was restricted to 75% of ad libitum intake to diminish leg disorders and hydrops ascites. Tap water was provided ad libitum throughout the experimental period. Up to the start of feed restriction, 22 h light was given per 24 h; thereafter it was reduced to 16 h. From day 4 onwards red light was given to prevent cannibalism. Isolator temperature was gradually decreased from 35 8C at day 1 to 20 8C at day 31. From day 31 to the end of the experiment isolator temperature was kept at approximately 20 8C. All chickens were housed, handled and treated following approval by the Animal Experimental Committee of the Veterinary Faculty of Utrecht University, The Netherlands, in accordance with the Dutch regulation on experimental animals.\n\nThe IB vaccine virus H120 was obtained as commercial freeze-dried 1000 doses vials which contained at least 10 3.0 EID 50 (egg infective dose 50%) per dose (Nobilis 1 IB H120; batch 041106A).\n\nThe virulent Massachusetts IBV strain M41 was obtained from Intervet, Boxmeer, the Netherlands, as freeze-dried vials containing 10 8.3 EID 50 /1.2 ml/vial. The virus had been passaged twice in SPF embryonated eggs. All IBV inocula were prepared in distilled water just prior to use and contained at least 10 3.0 EID 50 /ml of H120 virus and 10 4.6 EID 50 /ml of M41 virus. The Escherichia coli strain 506 (O78; K80) was isolated from a commercial broiler (Van Eck and Goren, 1991) . The E. coli culture was prepared as described by Matthijs et al. (2003) and was used at a concentration of 10 7.6 CFU/ml.\n\nAt day 1, broilers were randomly divided into four groups of 30 chickens each. Each group was housed in a separate isolator. At 27 days of age, all groups were inoculated oculo-nasally (one droplet of 0.05 ml per bird in each eye and nostril) and intratracheally (1 ml per bird): groups 1 and 2 received distilled water, group 3 received IBV H120 virus and group 4 IBV M41 virus. At 32 days of age, groups 2, 3 and 4 were intratracheally inoculated with 1 ml E. coli 506 culture per bird. Group 1 received 1 ml PBS-diluted glucose broth intratracheally per bird. For convenience, we refer to group 1 (distilled water and PBS broth) as PBS group, group 2 (distilled water and E. coli broth) as the E. coli group, group 3 (IBV H120 virus and E. coli broth) as the H120 group, and group 4 (IBV M41 virus and E. coli broth) as M41 group.\n\nClinical signs of IBV infection were determined 1, 2, 4 and 5 days after IBV inoculation and after E. coli inoculation just before euthanizing. A bird was recorded as having signs of IBV infection if mucous nasal discharge was observed after mild pressure on the nostrils (Matthijs et al., 2003) .\n\nFrom each group, 5 broilers were electrocuted and blood collected at 0.5 h, 3 h and at days 1, 2, 4 and 7 after E. coli inoculation (hpi/dpi). At each time point, colibacillosis lesions were scored macroscopically. Lesion scoring was performed as described by Van Eck and Goren (1991) in the left and right thoracic air sac, pericardium and liver. Lesion scores ranged from 0 to 3 per organ, leading to a maximum score of 12 per bird (Matthijs et al., 2005) .\n\nPeripheral blood, spleen and lung were collected from sacrificed birds. Spleen tissue was squeezed through a 70 mm mesh to prepare single cell suspensions. Splenocytes and PBMC were isolated by density gradient centrifugation for 20 min at 850 \u00c2 g using Ficoll-Hypaque (density 1.078), washed twice with PBS (Cambrex) and adjusted to 5 \u00c2 10 7 cells/ml in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamax-I (Gibco) and 100 U/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco).\n\nCell suspensions were fluorescently labeled for 30 min on ice with mAb against thrombocytes (mouse anti-chicken CD41/CD61:FITC, Serotec), monocytes (mouse anti-chicken monocyte/macrophage KUL-01:FITC, Southern Biotechnology Associates) and CD8 + cells (mouse anti-chicken CD8a:FITC, mouse anti-chicken CD8b:RPE, Southern Biotechnology Associates). Subsequently, cell-associated fluorescence was analyzed by flow cytometry using Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson). Results are expressed as percentages of total viable cells.\n\nCells were seeded in flatbottom 96-well plates at 2.5 \u00c2 10 6 cells in 50 ml culture medium (RPMI1640 + 2% chicken serum + 2 mM glutamax-I (Gibco) and 100 U/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco). Cells were incubated for 48 h at 41 8C (5% CO 2 ) with 100 ml of either culture medium to determine background production of nitric oxide (NO), medium supplemented with 10 mg/ml heatkilled E. coli 506, or medium with 10 mg/ml E. coli LPS (from E. coli O55:B5, Sigma) to measure maximum NO production. After incubation, 50 ml/well of culture supernatant was transferred to sterile flatbottom 96well plates. An NO dilution series (200-3.13 mM) was included on each plate as a standard curve to determine the amount of NO produced. To each well, 50 ml of Griess reagent (1% sulfanilamide and 0.3% naphtylenediamine, 1:1 in 2.5% phosphoric acid) was added, plates were incubated for 10 min at room temperature on a plate shaker and absorbance was recorded at 550 nm. For each chicken, NO secretion was calculated as total amount of NO produced by the cells after stimulation with heat-killed E. coli or E. coli LPS, minus the background NO production by unstimulated cells.\n\nSplenocytes and PBMC were incubated for 30 min at 10 8 cells in 1 ml RPMI 1640, 5% FBS containing 10 9 E. coli bacteria, in roundbottom 12 ml polypropylene tubes (Greiner Bio-One) at 37 8C, 5% CO 2 , to allow bacterial adhesion and entrance. At this point, gentamycin (200 mg/ml; Gibco) was added to each tube to kill extracellular bacteria and cells were incubated for an additional 30 min at 37 8C. Cells were washed once with PBS to remove the gentamycin, and either lysed directly with 1% saponin (T = 0.5 h) to release intracellular bacteria, or incubated for 14 h or 24 h in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% FBS and 20 mg/ml gentamycin before cell lysis. The cells were cultured in the presence of gentamycin to prevent re-infection and unlimited growth in the medium of E. coli released from dead cells. After saponin treatment, cell lysates were centrifuged and pellets were resuspended in 200 ml PBS and plated in duplicate (100 ml lysate per plate) on McConky Agar (MCA) plates (Biotrading) to determine the number of viable bacteria. The MCA plates were incubated overnight at 37 8C and colonies were counted blindly. Results were calculated as the sum of colonies on the duplicate plates. If the sum of colony counts on the duplicate plates was below 100 colonies, cells were considered successful in clearing the E. coli, whereas cells were considered unable to clear the bacteria when counts were over 300 colonies.\n\nRNA samples isolated from spleen and lung were screened for mRNA encoding IL-1b, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-18, IFNa, IFNb, and IFNg. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Purified RNA was eluted in 30 ml RNase-free water and stored at \u00c080 8C. Reverse transcription was performed using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Biorad). Primers and probes (Applied Biosystems) were designed according to Kaiser et al. (2003) and Rothwell et al. (2004) and are listed in Table 1 . For the quantitative RT-PCR assay TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) was used. Primers were used at 300 nM and probes at 100 nM concentration. Amplification and detection of specific products was achieved with the MyiQ Single-Color Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) with the following cycle profile: one cycle of 50 8C for 2 min, one cycle of 95 8C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95 8C for 10 s and 59 8C for 1 min. Results were expressed as fold changes between samples, relative to the PBS group (Philbin et al., 2005) . To correct for variation in RNA preparation and sampling, Ct values for cytokine-specific product for each sample were standardized using the Ct value of 28S-specific product for the same sample. To normalize RNA levels between samples within an experiment, the mean Ct value for 28S-specific product was calculated by pooling Ct values of all samples in that experiment. Well-to-well variations in Ct value of 28S-specific product about the experimental mean were calculated. The slope of the 28S dilution series regression lines was used to calculate differences in input of total RNA. Fold differences in cytokine expression between treatment groups were calculated relative to the reference ribosomal RNA, using a method adapted from Philbin et al. (2005) . Fold differences were calculated from the C T values C (for the cytokine) and C 0 (for ribosomal RNA) using the equation 10 log R \u00f0A=B\u00de \u00bc \u00bd\u00f0C A \u00c0 C B \u00de=S \u00c0 \u00bd\u00f0C 0 A \u00c0 C 0 B \u00de=S 0 , where S and S 0 are, respectively, the slopes of plots of C T value against the 10 logarithm of concentration for serial dilutions of cytokine DNA and ribosomal RNA, assayed on the same plate. This calculation avoids assumptions about the efficiency of the PCR amplifications and reduces to the common DDC T method in the case that both have perfect efficiency.\n\nBetween-group differences per time point were nonparametrically analyzed for each assay using the Mann-Whitney test. Partial correlations between different assays were determined per time point, with treatment as a control variable. Analysis was performed using the SPSS program and the probability level for significance was taken as P < 0.05.\n\nFive days after IBV inoculation, all broilers in the M41 group and 10% of the broilers in the H120 group showed nasal discharge. Birds were examined macroscopically for colibacillosis lesions (Fig. 1) . No lesions were observed in birds of the E. coli group at 0.5 h and 3 h after E. coli inoculation, at these time points all broilers of the H120 and the M41 groups, except one in the H120 group, had airsacculitis. Airsacculitis (colibacillosis lesions in the thoracic air sacs) was observed in chickens of all E. coliinoculated groups between 1 and 4 dpi. At 7 dpi, no signs of colibacillosis were observed anymore in the E. coli group whereas all birds of the H120 and the M41 groups had airsaccullitis. Systemic lesions (perihepatitis / pericarditis) were observed in 1 bird of the H120 group and 2 birds of the M41 groups at 7 dpi. No macroscopical signs of colibacillosis were observed in birds of the PBS group throughout the course of the experiment. More detailed clinical data can be found in Matthijs et al. (submitted for publication).\n\nThe frequencies of thrombocytes, monocytes/macrophages, CD8b + and CD8a + cells were analyzed as percentages of total viable cells in PBMC and splenocyte cell suspensions by flow cytometry at 1, 2, 4 and 7 dpi. Thrombocytes accounted for 60-75% of PBMC and 2-4% of splenocytes, with no significant differences between the treatment groups or fluctuations in time (data not shown). The percentage monocytes in peripheral blood of all E. coli-inoculated birds increased up to 4 dpi, and at 7 dpi, dropped to levels found in the PBS group (Fig. 2) . A significant positive correlation (P < 0.01) between monocyte percentages and colibacillosis lesion scores was found at 4 dpi. Whereas an effect of the E. coli inoculation on monocyte frequencies was apparent, monocyte frequencies were not significantly decreased or increased in IBV-inoculated birds when compared to birds that received E. coli only. In the spleen at 1 dpi, a significantly higher percentage of macrophages was found in IBV-infected birds, and only in the H120 group, a higher percentage of macrophages was found at all time points. These changes were not significantly correlated to lesion scores. Significant variations in the percentages of CD8b + , PBMC and splenocytes between the treatment groups were observed at different time points, but these variations were not related to an effect of either E. coli or IBV (data not shown). Similar fluctuations in the percentages of CD8a + b \u00c0 cells were found, apart from 1 dpi, where the M41 group showed higher percentages of CD8a + b \u00c0 cells than the other groups, but no significant correlation was found with the E. coli or IBV inoculation (data not shown).\n\nThe Griess reaction assay was used to determine whether IBV inoculation had an effect on the production of NO by splenocytes and PBMC after subsequent stimulation with heat-killed E. coli bacteria or E. coli LPS. NO production by PBMC of the E. coli-inoculated groups at 1 dpi was significantly higher than of the PBS group (Fig. 3) . Furthermore the IBV-inoculated groups, most notably the H120 group, showed higher NO production than the E. coli group, but at 2 dpi, NO production of the IBV-inoculated groups almost halved. At 7 dpi, NO production of the E. coli group had dropped to the level of the PBS group, whereas NO production by both the H120 and M41 groups was elevated compared to the PBS and E. coli groups.\n\nNO production by PBMC and splenocytes after E. coli LPS-stimulation showed a pattern comparable to stimulation with heat-killed E. coli, although the amount of NO produced was approximately twice as high (data not shown).\n\nThe ability of PBMC and splenocytes to kill E. coli bacteria after internalization was determined at 4 and 7 dpi, based on the number of colonies found after 24 h incubation. Uptake of bacteria was confirmed after 14 h incubation as the number of E. coli colonies retrieved from the PBMC and splenocytes and was higher than 300 in all chickens (data not shown). At 7 dpi, in the H120 and M41 groups the PBMC of 3 respectively 4 out of 5 chickens did not kill engulfed bacteria based on high colony counts, whereas only 1 chicken in the PBS group and 1 chicken in the E. coli group did not kill intracellular bacteria (Table 2) . At 4 dpi, splenocytes from all groups successfully killed E. coli bacteria. At 7 dpi however, splenocytes from 2 chickens in the H120 group were not able to kill the bacteria within 24 h incubation (data not shown).\n\nTo examine the effects of IBV and E. coli inoculation on systemic immune functions, cytokine mRNA expression of spleen and lung samples were measured by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. No significant differences between the groups were found at any time point for IL-4, IFNa and IFNb in either spleen or lung samples (data not shown). At 1 dpi, spleen mRNA levels for IFNg and the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b and IL-6 (data not shown) as well as IL-8, IL-18 and IFNg (Fig. 4A) were significantly upregulated in the E. Fig. 3 . Means AE S.E.M. of E. coli-induced NO production in response to heat-killed E. coli 506 by PBMC per group, at various time points after E. coli inoculation. Groups H120 and M41 were inoculated with their respective IBV strains 5 days before E. coli inoculation, whereas the PBS group received no IBVor E. coli. NO production by cells of individual chickens is calculated as the total NO production after stimulation with heat-killed E. coli or LPS, minus the background NO production of unstimulated cells. Groups with different letters are significantly different (P < 0.05).\n\ncoli-inoculated group in comparison to the IBVinoculated groups. Similarly, mRNA levels for the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was increased significantly in E. coli-inoculated birds compared to the IBV-inoculated birds. The mRNA levels of these cytokines dropped sharply from 2 dpi onward. Interestingly, at 7 dpi, only in the H120 group, IL-6, IL-10 and IFNg mRNA expression was still higher than the E. coli group. Tests were carried out to find whether altered expression of cytokine mRNA in IBV-inoculated birds was also found in lung samples (Fig. 4B) . In lung samples, no significant differences between the groups were found at any time point for IL-18, IFNb and IFNg (data not shown). In contrast to our findings in the spleen, at 3 hpi, mRNA levels for IL-6, IL-8, IFNg (data not shown), IL-10 and IL-1b (Fig. 4B ) in lung samples of birds of the H120 and especially the M41groups were higher than those of the E. coli group. However, at 1 dpi, mRNA expression of these cytokines in the E. coli group had increased similar to, or higher than that of the birds in the IBV infected groups. Levels remained elevated at 2 dpi, with highest expression in the IBV H120 group. At 7 dpi, mRNA expression levels of all three E. coli-inoculated groups had dropped to the level of the birds of the PBS group.\n\nEnhanced susceptibility for bacterial infections as a consequence of viral infection is reported in varying combinations in various species (Hament et al., 1999) . In poultry, severe colibacillosis after infections with Table 2 Phagocytosis and killing of bacteria by PBMC of chickens killed 4 and 7 days after E. coli inoculation (dpi)\n\nColony counts 4 dpi a Colony counts 7 dpi a <100 100-300 >300 <100 100-300 >300\n\nBirds were inoculated with Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) vaccine strain H120 (group: H120), virulent IBV strain M41 (group: M41) or PBS (groups: PBS and E. coli) and 5 days later inoculated with E. coli, the PBS group with PBS. Each group consisted of five broilers. Numbers represent the number of chickens in each group displaying the specified killing efficiency. For each chicken, samples were run in duplicate. a The number of colonies retrieved from phagocytic cells after lysis was used as a measurement for killing efficiency; retrieval of less than Infectious Bronchitis Virus is well documented (Peighambari et al., 2000; Vandekerchove et al., 2004) and is a serious problem in commercial chickens.\n\nInterestingly, not only the virulent IBV M41 field strain induces enhanced susceptibility to subsequent E. coli infection, but the mild H120 vaccine strain also induces this enhanced colibacillosis to about the same level (Matthijs et al., 2003) . A model based on these findings was used to study the phenomenon and test the contribution of different possible factors causing the phenomenon. In a separate paper, we addressed the question whether local changes at the surfaces of the trachea, lung and airsacs might facilitate local bacterial growth and subsequent entry of bacteria. The results of that study showed that the clearance of the bacteria from the lung was comparable for all the groups inoculated with E. coli, irrespective of previous exposure to virus (Matthijs et al., submitted for publication) .\n\nIn this paper we examined whether prior exposure to IBV virus (M41 or H120) affected the effector functions of mononuclear cells resulting in the phenomenon of enhanced susceptibility, a hypothesis supported by several papers (Ficken et al., 1987; Naqi et al., 2001; Slifka et al., 2003) . For this question, NO production by mononuclear cells isolated from the spleen and PBMC were tested. After E. coli inoculation, the NO production in samples upon stimulation with heatkilled E. coli bacteria or E. coli LPS (data not shown) was strongly increased in all groups, irrespective of prior exposure to IBV, although at 1 dpi the increase was highest in IBV-inoculated birds. Another difference was observed at 7 dpi, where birds exposed to E. coli alone showed diminished NO production compared to birds also exposed to either IBV strain (M41 or H120). This is in line with the clinical picture of bacterial persistence in broilers previously exposed to IBV.\n\nSubsequently, the internalization and intracellular killing of bacteria was tested in splenocytes and PBMC of all groups. Again all groups exposed to E. coli, irrespective of earlier exposure to IBV, responded similarly in the assay at 4 dpi, in that the cells had a diminished killing capacity. At a later time point (7 dpi), bactericidal capacity in the groups exposed to IBV was still lower than the bactericidal capacity of the group exposed to E. coli alone, suggesting a slower recovery. This once more was in line with the clinical recovery observed in the E. coli alone group.\n\nThe results of the NO production and of the internalization and intracellular killing of bacteria by the individual splenocytes or PBMCs suggest that the small changes in effector functions of those cells cannot be the only reason for the phenomenon of enhanced colibacillosis in animals previously exposed to virus. However, changes in the number of cells and/or their recruitment could still influence the outcome of the secondary infection. We therefore evaluated the percentage of effector cells by FACS analysis. Major differences that could explain the enhanced colibacillosis in the samples of the dual infected groups were not found.\n\nBecause no major changes in the effector functions of the mononuclear cells could be found to explain the phenomenon of enhanced colibacillosis, other mechanisms to explain the findings were sought. Supported by the observation that clinical colibacillosis seemed mainly the result of a systemic effect, and not directly of a local lung condition, we set out to find other explanations and looked at whether cytokine profiles would clarify the clinical picture. This might lead to insights into how the innate capacity of the animals was modulated at the time of E. coli exposure. Therefore, we examined mRNA expression in splenocytes and in samples of the lung.\n\nAfter E. coli inoculation alone, the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b and IL-6 were strongly increased in both splenocytes and lung tissue. This was expected, because both cytokines play an important role in initiating an acute-phase immune response against invading pathogens and activating a wide range of immune cells such as macrophages and T-cells (Wigley and Kaiser, 2003) .\n\nThe pro-inflammatory chemokine IL-8 was found to be upregulated in lung samples as early as 3 hpi, and in splenocytes at 1 dpi. The findings in the lung are in agreement with its function as a chemotractant, produced at the infection site in order to recruit heterophils and initiate a rapid local inflammatory response (Withanage et al., 2004) . The upregulation in spleen samples was only found in the E. coli group and is likely due to the fact that the bacteria are not retained in the respiratory tract but spread systemically. Surprisingly, in the IBV groups no IL-8 mRNA is found in the spleen, which might suggest that a lack of response in the spleen can contribute to prolonged colibacillosis. The mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory mediators IL-1b and IL-6 in the spleen at 1 dpi in IBV groups also lagged behind that of the E. coli group.\n\nNot only the cytokines IFNg and IL-18, but also IL-10 were found to be upregulated in splenocytes and lung samples of birds inoculated with E. coli alone. IFNg is a potent macrophage-activating factor and IL-18 is an important inducer of IFNg production (Wigley and Kaiser, 2003) . Both IFNg and IL-18 are strongly linked to a cell-mediated Th1-like immune response (Staeheli et al., 2001) . IL-10 on the other hand is a promotor of Th2-like immune responses, predominantly by inhibiting pro-inflammatory and Th1 cytokines (Rothwell et al., 2004) , which can increase host susceptibility to bacterial diseases through its anti-inflammatory effects, including suppression of macrophage function. Previous studies in chickens showed that IL-10 production could be accompanied by either downregulation of IFNg production (Abdul-Careem et al., 2007; Rothwell et al., 2004) , but also by concurrent upregulation of IL-10 and IFNg (Hong et al., 2006) . Moreover, it should be noted that IL-10 is known to have immunostimulatory effects in certain species, inducing MHC class II upregulation and cytotoxic T-cell stimulation (Groux and Cottrez, 2003) . In our chicken model, we find that high mRNA expression of pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines at 1 dpi in spleen samples is not found in the birds that were inoculated with IBV and E. coli, but only in the E. coli inoculated birds, and thus seems to be associated with recovery of colibacillosis. The differences in mRNA expression are consistent with the finding that virus-induced modulation of the immune response plays an important role in the susceptibility to subsequent bacterial infection.\n\nIn conclusion, we observed that both vaccine and virulent IBV caused enhanced colibacillosis, but IBV did not significantly affect phagocytic capacity and NO production of peripheral mononuclear cells and splenocytes. However, IBV did alter the systemic cytokine mRNA expression patterns after E. coli inoculation in commercial broilers likely resulting in enhanced colibacillosis."}
