{"title": "Molecular characterisation of the 3-end of the astrovirus genome", "body": "Astroviruses are often observed in faeces in connection with juvenile diarrhoea [9, 11] . The 6.8 kb plus-strand RNA genome is organised in a 5-non-coding region (NCR), three open reading frames, eighty nucleotides (nt) 3-NCR, and a poly(A) tail of approximately 30 nt [4] . The capsid protein precursor gene (ORF 2) is located next to the 3-NCR. The capsid protein precursor is translated from a subgenomic mRNA [15] .\n\nComplete nucleotide sequences are available for HAstV-1 [18] and for HAstV-2 [4] . Comparison of these two sequences shows that the 3-NCR are 94% conserved, and that the 114 amino acids deduced from the 3 end of ORF 2 are 62% identical [14] . Limited nucleotide sequence information for the six other serotypes are available in the nucleotide databases [10, 16] .\n\nThe 3-end of RNA virus genomes are involved in regulating the initiation of synthesis of the minus-strand RNA. This region may also participate in the regulation of plus-strand synthesis, RNA stability, translation initiation and intracellular localisation. The aims of the present study were to predict secondary structures, postulate possible functional domains, reveal conserved regions suitable for nucleic acid amplification, and perform phylogenetic analysis by comparing the 3-ends of the different human astrovirus serotypes.\n\nAstrovirus RNA was made available by dialysing and heating faecal extracts or CaCo-2 cell culture supernatants [5] . The templates for sequencing were made by reverse transcription of astrovirus RNA with an oligo d(T) primer, and subsequent PCR on the cDNA with the oligo d(T) primer and a 5 biotinylated upstream primer (5-AAC CGT GTA ACC CTC (C/T) T, position 6 476-6 492). The nucleotide numbering used throughout this paper is adopted from the HAstV-2 sequence [4] . The PCR-product was captured on magnetic beads coated with streptavidin (Dynal, Norway), and the minus-strand eluted with NaOH according to the manufacturers' recommendations. After neutralisation the minus-strand was sequenced with a primer (5-AC CGT GTA ACC CTC CTC TC) extending three nt downstream of the upstream PCR primer. The above PCR was not successful for HAstV The following list indicates the number of novel and previously published (GenBank) sequences within each serotype used in the present analyses: HAstV-1: 3 novel samples, 2 published; HAstV-2: 3 novel samples, 1 published; HAstV-3: 3 novel samples; HAstV-4: 2 novel samples, 1 published; HAstV-5: 1 novel sample; HAstV-6: 1 novel sample, 1 published; HAstV-7: 1 novel sample; HAstV-8: 1 in GenBank. The novel samples were from independent outbreaks of diarrhoea, collected in Norway and the UK. In addition cDNA from 12 untyped astroviruses from all over the world were sequenced. The Wisconsin sequence analysis package 8.0 (Genetics Computer Group, Wisconsin, USA) was used for sequence analyses. In addition the PHYLIP 3.5 software package (J. Felsenstein, Department of Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle, USA) was used for phylogenetic analyses.\n\nAlignment of one cDNA sequence of each serotype is shown in Fig. 1 . The 3-NCRs and the terminal 19 nt of the ORF2, were highly conserved between all the serotypes. In the rest of the sequenced part of the ORF2, however, there were substantial nucleotide and amino acid differences. This suggests a selective pressure on the level of RNA in the extreme 3end of ORF2. In the rest of the sequenced region of the capsid protein precursor, most of the amino acids were not conserved. However, Kimura corrected ratios of synonymous to nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions were above two, which suggests some conservation at the amino acid level. The distances matrices in Table 1 indicate that HAstV-3 and 7 are closely related, while the C-terminal end of the capsid protein of HAstV-4 is very different from the other serotypes. All the untyped astroviruses had sequences related to one of the known serotypes. Eight of these isolates clustered with HAstV-1, two with HAstV-2 and two, one from Ghaza and one from Uganda, with HAstV-8. These untyped isolates were included in the calculation of the intratype differences shown in Table 1 . The low intra-type RNA sequence variability and the distinct differences between the serotypes indicate that the serotypes based on reactivity to antibodies are phylogenetically distinct groups, as previously suggested [16] . However, the difference between HAstV-3 and 7 is only slightly higher than the differences within HAstV-1 which is the most prevalent serotype [11] . Serotype  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8   1  5  29  28  57  28  31  29  28  2  49  3  14  61  30  29  14  31  3  36  21  0  58  26  30  7  27  4  123  118  123  3  58  54  58  64  5  4 Phylogenetic analyses, using neighbour joining, maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood, indicated a clade consisting of HAstV-2, 3 and 7 (Fig. 2) . This clade was supported (90 %) by boot-strapping tests.\n\nMajor et al. [12] could not find any significant homology between the 3-end of the HAstV-1 genome and other virus, while Willcocks and Carter [19] found a 17% identity between the 3-NCR of HAstV-1 and certain enteroviruses. Searching data bases of virus nucleic acids, we found a sequence in the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) RNA [1] with 90% identity to the first 35 nt of the conserved part of the 3-end of the HAstV genome (position 6 696-6 730). The 35 nt IBV sequence is in a conserved part of the nucleocapsid gene about 100 nt from the poly(A) tail. The two sequences are not in the same reading frame in IBV and HAstV, and the sequence is not found in other coronaviruses. This makes it unlikely that the similarities are caused by convergent evolution. Statistically, a 90% similarity to a 35 nt sequence is expected to be found once in a sequence of 10 nt. The virus sequence database we used contained 3;10 nt, and the sequence searched for was 300 nt, implying a 10\\ probability for the observed similarity to be incidental.\n\nThe 35 nt are included in the stem-loop II (Fig. 3) , and in a similar structure in IBV. It has been suggested that transcription pauses caused by strong secondary structures can induce recombination [8] . Together with the high frequency of recombination reported for coronaviruses [7, 13] , the data suggest the homology to be due to a recombination.\n\nAlthough the regulation of initiation of plus-and minus-strand RNA replication probably differs, some common initiation signals may be located at the 3-ends of the opposite RNA strands [17] . When we compared the 3-and 5-NCRs, a sequence complementary to an eight nucleotide motif (position 6 766-6 773) was found in the conserved part of the 5-NCR (position 13-20). The 3-NCR thus shares this motif with the 3-end of the minus-strand RNA. The octamer sequence in the 3-NCR is conserved, except for position 6 771 which differ from the consensus in HAstV-4, 5 and 7.\n\nOur MFOLD predictions of secondary structures with minimal free energy gave eight stem-loops for most of the serotypes (Figs. 1 and 3) . As shown for HAstV-2 in Fig. 3 , we have extended the Roman numerals numbering of the stem-loops starting from the 3-end as previously suggested [14] .\n\nIn addition to the free energy of the predicted RNA folding, nucleation centres, direction of synthesis, long-range interactions, and extragenomic factors influence the secondary structure. These elements are difficult to analyse, but further evidence for the significance of a secondary structure may be obtained by comparing the predicted folding of closely related RNA-genomes [3] .\n\nStem-loops I and II are formed in the highly conserved part of the 3-end. Two distinctly different RNA secondary structures, based on RNA sequences of the 3-ends of the HAstV-1 [19] and HAstV-1 and -2 [14] genomes, have previously been predicted. The stem-loop I predicted by MFOLD, corresponded to the one suggested by Monroe et al. [14] . It included six nt of the poly(A) tail which is not included in the folding suggested by Willcocks and Carter [19] . In the stem there are four mismatched base pairs or bulges (Fig. 3 ). There is some nucleotide variation between the serotypes in these positions (Fig. 1) , but the bulges are maintained. This suggests a biological function of the bulges. Similar bulges are, for example, shown to be recognition sites for the binding of Rev and Tat to HIV RNA [2] .\n\nThe octamer, which has a counterpart in the 3-end of the minus-strand, is situated in the loop of stem-loop I. The MFOLD program did not predict any similar secondary structure in the 3-end of the minus-strand, however, the minus-strand octamer appeared in a single stranded region, suggesting that the putative signal is in the primary sequence.\n\nIt has been reported that in the hinge between stem-loop I and II, the HAstV-1 lacks two residues found in HAstV-2 [14] . We found that HAstV-3 and -7 are similar to HAstV-2, while HAstV-4 and -6 are one residue shorter, and HAstV-5 and HAstV-8 are three residues longer than HAstV-2. These differences are probably phylogenetically significant, and support the clade of serotypes 2, 3, and 7. The heterogeneity of this region is consistent with the suggested hinge structure.\n\nThe reported compensating nucleotide differences in the stem-loop II of HAstV-1 and 2 [14] , are also found in the other serotypes (Fig. 1) . HAstV-2, 3 and 7 have AGA in position 6 694-6 696 and a complementary TCT in position 6 730-6 732, while HAstV-4 has GAG and CTC, and the other serotypes AAG and CTT, giving an equally stable duplex. The compensating substitutions suggest that the stem is biologically important.\n\nNucleotide substitutions which require compensating substitutions to maintain a vital function, are less likely to have occurred several times during the evolution. The covariations therefore further support the phylogenetic relationship we have proposed between the HAstV-2, -3 and -7, as opposed to the phylogeny proposed by Noel et al. [16] .\n\nIn stem-loops III -VIII the stems and loops of the various serotypes differ in length.\n\nThe sequences obtained in this work support our previous experimental observations that the 3-NCR is a suitable target for universal and specific detection of astrovirus RNA [6] . The universal primers suggested in the former paper have positions 6 815-6 796 and 6 739-6 761. Our analyses also support the taxonomic classification of astroviruses as a separate family [14] ."}
