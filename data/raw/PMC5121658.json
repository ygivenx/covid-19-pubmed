{"title": "Mint3/Apba3 depletion ameliorates severe murine influenza pneumonia and macrophage cytokine production in response to the influenza virus", "body": "To determine whether Mint3 contributes to immune responses during lung IFV infection, we first intranasally infected wild-type (WT: C57BL/6) and Mint3-deficient (Mint3\u2212/\u2212) mice with a lethal dose of IFV (104 plaque forming units (PFU)/mouse). IFV-infected WT mice appeared visibly ill with ruffled fur and reduced oral intake 6 to 10 days after infection, whereas Mint3\u2212/\u2212 mice appeared more active than the WT mice. Consistent with their apparent activity, the final survival rate on day 21 after infection was significantly improved in Mint3\u2212/\u2212 mice (~80%) as compared with that in WT mice (~50%; Fig. 1a). Histopathological analysis of the IFV-infected lungs on days 4 and 8 revealed that lung inflammation, which was the most obvious on day 8 in WT mice, was much less severe in Mint3\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 1b).\n\nGiven that inflammatory cytokines/chemokines are linked to lung damage in severe influenza pneumonia12131417181930, we analysed the infiltrated cells and cytokine/chemokine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) collected from the IFV-infected lungs of WT and Mint3\u2212/\u2212 mice. Consistent with the pathological data, the total number of infiltrated cells in BALF from Mint3\u2212/\u2212 mice was decreased compared to that from WT mice on days 4 and 8 after IFV infection (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. S1a\u2013c). This was attributed to the significant decrease in neutrophils that comprised the major subpopulations of infiltrated cells (Fig. 1c). In contrast, the numbers of T, B, and natural killer cells as well as macrophages were not significantly altered in BALF from the Mint3\u2212/\u2212 lungs (Fig. 1c). The levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, i.e., IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, CCL3/MIP-1\u03b1, CXCL1/KC, and CXCL10/IP-10, which have been reported to contribute to lung pathology111216, also decreased in BALF from Mint3\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to those from WT mice on day 4 after infection (Fig. 1d). In addition, the levels of CXCL1/KC and CXCL10/IP-10 in BALF from Mint3\u2212/\u2212 mice remained lower than those from WT mice on day 8 after infection. These data indicate that host Mint3 contributes to cytokine/chemokine production including the neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL1/KC at an early time point after IFV infection and influences subsequent inflammatory cell recruitment and lung pathology at a later time point. Collectively, Mint3 depletion attenuated the severe influenza pneumonia and improved host mortality in mice.\n\nActivation of innate immunity in response to IFV regulates anti-viral protective immunity31. To evaluate the impact of Mint3 deficiency on anti-IFV protection, we first analysed the viral copy number in the IFV-infected lungs of WT and Mint3\u2212/\u2212 mice on day 0, 4, and 8 following the IFV infection. Mint3 depletion did not largely affect the viral copy number in the IFV-infected lungs (Fig. 2a). Type-I interferons (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) are the primary factors that induce host resistance to IFV. In particular, IFN-\u03b1 induction in the late stage of IFV infection is essential for protection against IFV3132. In contrast to cytokine/chemokine production, no significant difference was observed in IFN-\u03b1 production in the infected lungs between WT and Mint3\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 2b). Notably, the level of the type-II interferon IFN-\u03b3 was significantly lower in the lungs of Mint3\u2212/\u2212 mice than in those of WT mice on day 8 but not on day 4 after infection (Fig. 2b) for unknown reasons. Next, we assessed the induction of humoral acquired immunity against IFV in Mint3\u2212/\u2212 mice. WT and Mint3\u2212/\u2212 mice were infected again with IFV on day 21 after the first infection (representing the second infection) and the production of virus-specific antibodies was analysed on day 7 after the second infection. Mint3 depletion in mice affected neither the production of virus-specific IgG in the serum nor virus-specific IgA in the lung mucosa (Fig. 2c). Collectively, these data suggest that Mint3 is dispensable for the induction of protective immunity against IFV infection in mice.\n\nMacrophages and dendritic cells are known to comprise an early source of inflammatory cytokines and type-I interferons in pulmonary IFV infection1116. Mint3 depletion affects macrophage function owing to reduced HIF-1 activity and ATP production via glycolysis252728. Thus, we focused on the function of Mint3 in macrophages and dendritic cells, and examined whether Mint3 in macrophages and dendritic cells is required for cytokine/chemokine production in response to IFV. Alveolar macrophages (AMFs), thioglycolate-induced peritoneal macrophages (TG-MFs), bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMFs), bone marrow-derived conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), or Flt3 ligand-induced plasmacytoid dendritic cells (FLT3L-DCs) prepared from WT or Mint3\u2212/\u2212 mice were brought into contact with IFV in vitro and the production of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and CCL2/MCP-1 was measured. The cytokine/chemokine production in response to IFV decreased in Mint3\u2212/\u2212 AMFs (Fig. 3a), TG-MFs (Fig. 3b), and BMMFs (Fig. 3c). Furthermore, Mint3 depletion in BMMFs also attenuated cytokine/chemokine production in response to other pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in addition to IFV, such as LPS (Supplementary Fig. S2a), poly I:C (Supplementary Fig. S2b), and imiquimod (R837, Supplementary Fig. S2c). However, Mint3 depletion did not affect IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, or CCL2/MCP-1 production in cDCs (Fig. 3d) and FLT3-DCs (Fig. 3e) in response to IFV. Thus, the reduced cytokine/chemokine production by macrophages in response to IFV, but not by dendritic cells, likely accounts at least in part for the attenuation of influenza pneumonia in Mint3\u2212/\u2212 mice.\n\nIFV is recognized by pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptor 7 and retinoic acid inducible gene 1, which then activate the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway in cells3133. Although Mint3\u2212/\u2212 macrophages exhibit reduced HIF-1 activity252728, it remains unclear whether Mint3 also influences the activation of NF-\u03baB, a transcription factor that induces the expression of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines34. Thus, the expression levels of NF-\u03baB target genes such as Il6, Tnf, and Ccl2 in IFV-stimulated WT and Mint3\u2212/\u2212 BMMFs were analysed by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method. The expression levels of Il6, Tnf, and Ccl2 mRNA decreased in Mint3\u2212/\u2212 BMMFs following IFV stimulation (Fig. 4a). Next, nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB in IFV-stimulated BMMFs was examined by immunoblotting. Notably, NF-\u03baB protein levels in the nuclear extracts of Mint3\u2212/\u2212 BMMFs were lower than those of WT cells at the starting point (0 h) and remained lower during the observed time after IFV infection (Fig. 4b). Translocation of cytoplasmic NF-\u03baB to the nucleus is usually suppressed by inhibitor of \u03baB (I\u03baB); however, I\u03baB kinase (IKK) phosphorylates I\u03baB and thereby promotes proteasomal degradation of I\u03baB when the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway is activated34. Thus, we analysed I\u03baB and IKK in the cytoplasmic extracts from IFV-infected WT and Mint3\u2212/\u2212 BMMFs. The expression and phosphorylation levels of IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 showed no apparent differences between WT and Mint3\u2212/\u2212 BMMFs (Fig. 4c). However, the expression levels of I\u03baB\u03b1 markedly increased in Mint3\u2212/\u2212 BMMFs at the starting point (0 h) and remained higher than those of WT cells during the observed time after IFV stimulation (Fig. 4c). In turn, a lower proportion of I\u03baB\u03b1 was phosphorylated in Mint3\u2212/\u2212 BMMFs after IFV stimulation (Fig. 4c). Taken together, these findings indicate that Mint3 depletion resulted in the accumulation of I\u03baB\u03b1 in the cytoplasm and suppressed the activation of NF-\u03baB in response to IFV stimulation in macrophages.\n\nMint3\u2212/\u2212 macrophages exhibit defects in ATP production via glycolysis252728. Thus, we next examined whether IFV infection affects ATP levels in BMMFs. ATP levels in WT BMMFs decreased to the levels of Mint3\u2212/\u2212 cells 4\u20136 h after IFV infection, whereas Mint3\u2212/\u2212 cells maintained their ATP levels after IFV infection (Fig. 5a). When cells are starved, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein (AMP)-activated kinase (AMPK) is activated by phosphorylation35. Accordingly, the phosphorylation levels of AMPK\u03b1 increased in WT BMMFs after IFV infection (Fig. 5b). Mint3\u2212/\u2212 BMMFs showed increased phosphorylation levels of AMPK\u03b1 at the starting point reflecting their decreased ATP levels (Fig. 5a) and sustained their AMPK\u03b1 phosphorylation after IFV infection (Fig. 5b). Notably, the amount of AMPK\u03b1 protein increased after IFV stimulation in Mint3\u2212/\u2212 BMMFs (Fig. 5b).\n\nAMPK is known to suppress NF-\u03baB signalling via several pathways such as SIRT1, PGC\u03b11, and p53/FoxO36. We hypothesized that the defect of ATP production via glycolysis and the resulting AMPK activation by Mint3 depletion also affects the IFV-induced NF-\u03baB signalling in macrophages. To address this, WT and Mint3\u2212/\u2212 BMMFs were infected with IFV in the presence of a glycolysis inhibitor, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), a mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor, oligomycin, or vehicle, and the inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production was analysed. 2-DG but not oligomycin treatment decreased the inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production in WT BMMFs to the levels of Mint3\u2212/\u2212 cells. The AMPK activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carbox-amide-1-\u03b2-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR), also decreased the inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production in WT BMMFs to the levels of Mint3\u2212/\u2212 cells (Fig. 5c).\n\nNext, we examined whether AMPK activation via the glycolysis defect relates to the I\u03baB accumulation observed in Mint3\u2212/\u2212 BMMFs (Fig. 4c). To address this issue, I\u03baB\u03b1 and AMPK\u03b1 in IFV-infected WT BMMFs treated with or without 2-DG were analysed. 2-DG treatment did not impact either total or phosphorylated I\u03baB\u03b1 levels whereas both total and phosphorylated AMPK\u03b1 levels increased in IFV-infected WT BMMFs (Fig. 5d) and nuclear NF-\u03baB levels decreased (Fig. 5e). These results indicate that AMPK activation via the glycolysis defect attenuates NF-\u03baB signalling independently from I\u03baB accumulation in IFV-infected macrophages. In turn, we next examined whether I\u03baB accumulation alone could attenuate NF-\u03baB signalling in IFV-infected macrophages. To address this possibility, IFV-infected WT BMMFs were treated with or without an I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation inhibitor, BAY 11-708237. BAY 11-7082 treatment decreased phosphorylated I\u03baB\u03b1 levels and increased total I\u03baB\u03b1 levels without affecting total and phosphorylated AMPK\u03b1 levels in IFV-infected WT BMMFs (Fig. 5f). Under this condition, BAY 11-7082 treatment decreased nuclear NF-\u03baB levels in WT BMMFs 3\u20136 h after IFV infection (Fig. 5g). BAY 11\u20137082 treatment also decreased the inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production in WT BMMFs to the levels of Mint3\u2212/\u2212 cells (Fig. 5h). Thus, Mint3 depletion independently caused both AMPK activation and I\u03baB accumulation, each of which could separately attenuate NF-\u03baB signalling independently in macrophages.\n\nIn this study, we have shown that the Mint3-mediated pathway contributes to influenza pneumonia in mice. Mint3 depletion in mice reduced inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production and the infiltration of inflammatory cells in IFV-infected lungs, and improved mortality rates. In macrophages, Mint3 depletion also attenuated cytokine/chemokine production in response to IFV infection by suppressing the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway. This suppression in Mint3\u2212/\u2212 macrophages appeared to be mediated by two independent mechanisms: I\u03baB\u03b1 accumulation and AMPK activation (Fig. 6). Although how AMPK activation suppressed the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway in Mint3\u2212/\u2212 macrophages was unclear, several reported pathways such as SIRT1, PGC\u03b11, and p53/FoxO might contribute to this suppression of the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway by AMPK36.\n\nMint3 was considered dispensable for anti-IFV immunity because Mint3 depletion did not alter viral burden, the elevation of IFN-\u03b1, or the induction of anti-viral adaptive B cell responses in the IFV-infected mice. Thus, other innate mechanisms independent of the Mint3 pathway may play a more dominant role in protective immunity against IFV. Type II interferon IFN-\u03b3 production was reduced in the lungs of Mint3\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to that in the lungs of WT mice on day 8 but not on day 4 after IFV infection (Fig. 2b). As IFN-\u03b3 expression is regulated by HIF-138, Mint3 depletion might affect IFN-\u03b3 expression after IFV infection in mice. IFN-\u03b3 is not essential for viral clearance39; however, its presence during IFV infection ameliorates the severity of inflammation and lung injury40. Although how much the reduction of IFN-\u03b3 levels by Mint3 depletion affects the IFV-mediated lung injury remains unclear, supplementation with IFN-\u03b3 might support therapies of IFV-infected lung diseases based on Mint3 inhibition.\n\nMint3 promotes ATP production via glycolysis by activating HIF-1 in macrophages252728. AMPK is activated when the ATP concentration decreases in cells35. Thus, Mint3 depletion activated AMPK and thereby suppressed the NF-\u03baB signalling in macrophages. Notably, AMPK\u03b1 protein levels increased after IFV infection in Mint3\u2212/\u2212 and 2-DG treated WT macrophages, whereas the basal protein levels of AMPK\u03b1 were comparable between WT and Mint3\u2212/\u2212 macrophages (Fig. 5b,d). Infectious stress might boost the AMPK signalling by increasing the amount of AMPK\u03b1 protein in macrophages in combination with energy stress. Besides AMPK, HIF-1 also influences cytokine/chemokine transcription directly4142. Thus, Mint3-mediated HIF-1 activation might also contribute to the cytokine/chemokine production independently from AMPK in macrophages. In addition to AMPK, I\u03baB\u03b1 was also accumulated in Mint3\u2212/\u2212 macrophages. Although activated/phosphorylated IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 levels were comparable, less I\u03baB\u03b1 was phosphorylated in Mint3\u2212/\u2212 macrophages than in WT cells after IFV infection. Mint3 activates HIF-1 by suppressing its inhibitor, FIH-1. FIH-1 is an asparaginyl hydroxylase and hydroxylates the \u03b1 subunit of HIF-1 and other molecules including I\u03baB\u03b129. Although the hydroxylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 by FIH-1 has not been reported to affect the stability of I\u03baB\u03b1 in vitro43, FIH-1 might influence the phosphorylation state of I\u03baB\u03b1 in macrophages.\n\nMint3-mediated HIF-1 activation depends on an invasion-promoting membrane protease MT1-MMP/MMP14 in macrophages and cancer cells2526. We have recently reported that the monooxygenase NECAB3 and mTOR signalling also promote Mint3-mediated HIF-1 activation in cancer cells4445. Although whether NECAB3 relates to inflammation is unclear, mTOR contributes to inflammatory responses4647. Thus, Mint3 may function as a hub among these molecules and HIF-1, AMPK, and NF-\u03baB signalling pathways to orchestrate inflammation, metabolism, and invasion in macrophages.\n\nIn conclusion, Mint3 in macrophages acts to contribute to severe influenza pneumonia, but is dispensable for host protection against IFV. Thus, Mint3 inhibition might represent one of the likely therapeutic targets to control severe IFV infection without affecting viral clearance.\n\nMint3\u2212/\u2212 mice have been previously described27 (Riken Center for Developmental Biology (CDB) Accession No. CDB0589K; http://www2.clst.riken.jp/arg/mutant%20mice%20list.html). These mice were backcrossed at least 10 times onto C57BL/6 mice. C57BL/6 mice were purchased from CLEA Japan, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). The animals were housed in specific pathogen-free conditions. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee for Kitasato University Medical Center and animals were treated in accordance with the Regulations for Animal Experiments in Kitasato University.\n\nFluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-F4/80 (clone BM8), FITC-conjugated CD19 (clone 6D5), phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-Ly-6G (clone 1A8), biotin-conjugated anti-NK1.1 (clone PK136), peridinin chlorophyll protein/Cy5.5 (PerCP/Cy5.5)-conjugated anti-CD45 (clone 30-F11), and phycoerythrin-Cy7 (PC7)-conjugated anti-CD3\u03b5 (clone 145-2C11) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Biolegend (San Diego, CA). LPS from Escherichia coli 0111:B4, poly I:C, and 2-DG were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Imiquimod (R837) was purchased from Invivogen (San Diego, CA). Oligomycin was purchased from Merck Millipore (Billerica, MA). AICAR was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). BAY 11-7082 was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan).\n\nC57BL/6 and Mint3\u2212/\u2212 mice were anesthetized and infected with 104 PFU (unless otherwise indicated) of a mouse-adapted IFV (A/California/07/2009 strain: H1N1 isotype, kindly provided by Dr. Takato Odagiri (National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan) by intranasal administration as described304849.\n\nMice were euthanized by intraperitoneal administration of sodium pentobarbital at 0, 4, and 8 days after IFV infection and whole lungs were collected. Paraffin embedding and hematoxylin and eosin staining of tissues were performed using standard methodologies.\n\nBAL was carried out as described previously153048. In brief, the tracheas of mice were cannulated with 1.2-mm diameter polyethylene catheters. The lungs were instilled with 1 mL pre-warmed phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, followed by the retrieval of lavage fluid aliquots. Cells in the BAL fluid (BALF) were counted after red blood cell lysis and subjected to flow cytometric analysis. The supernatants of the BALF were subjected to multi cytokine/chemokine expression analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\n\nBALF cells were suspended in mouse FcR Blocking Reagent (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) for 10 min prior to staining with FITC-, PE-, biotin-, PerCP/Cy5.5-, or PC7-conjugated antibodies. After staining, biotinylated antibodies were visualized with streptavidin-energy-coupled dye (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The antibodies used were anti-F4/80, anti-CD19, anti-Ly-6G, anti-NK1.1, anti-CD45, and anti-CD3\u03b5. Stained cells were analysed with a Cytomics FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) and Flowjo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR).\n\nCytokine/chemokine and interferon levels in the BALF were measured with a Flow Cytomix Cytokine Bead Assay (Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria). Cell culture supernatants from BMMFs were assayed using specific ELISA kits for IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 (Biolegend), and CCL2/MCP-1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). All measurements were performed in triplicate.\n\nLung tissues were collected at 0, 4, or 8 days after IFV infection and homogenized using a gentleMACS dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec). RNA was extracted using an Isogen II RNA extraction kit (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). Reverse transcription was conducted with the Uni-12 primer (5\u2032-AGC AAA AGC AGG-3\u2032)50 and qPCR was performed with primers specific for the influenza nucleoprotein gene (NP) (Forward: 5\u2032-GAT TGG TGG AAT TGG ACG AT-3\u2032; Reverse: 5\u2032-AGA GCA CCA TTC TCT CTA TT-3\u2032) using the Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real Time PCR System (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The standard calibration curve for qPCR was obtained by stepwise dilution of the cloned NP gene fragment with a known copy number.\n\nB cell-mediated humoral responses were measured as virion-specific immunoglobulin production by ELISA, as previously described51. Briefly, 96-well ELISA plates (Corning, Corning, NY) were coated with ultrasonicated influenza virion (A/California/07/2009 strain) at 5 \u00d7 106 PFU/mL in a carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Plates were then washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Wako). Serum and BALF collected from mice at day 7 after the secondary infection were serially diluted with PBS/Tween 20 containing 5% skim milk, applied onto the virion-coated plates, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, goat anti-mouse total IgG or IgA conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Immunoresearch, Baltimore Pike, PA) was applied and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, the plates were stained with a TMB Substrate Set (Biolegend). The reaction was terminated with 1 M H2SO4 (Wako) and the absorbance was measured.\n\nAMFs were isolated from BALFs of WT or Mint3\u2212/\u2212 mice. TG-MFs were prepared as described52. BMMFs, cDCs, or FLT3L-DCs were prepared by culturing bone marrow cells for 5\u20138 days with RPMI1640 medium (Wako) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (Life Technologies) and antibiotics (100 IU/mL penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin; Sigma-Aldrich) containing M-CSF (25 ng/mL, Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ), GM-CSF (20 ng/mL, Peprotech), or human Flt3-ligand (100 ng/mL, Peprotech), respectively. For MF/DC stimulation, 1 \u00d7 105 cells were seeded on 24-well culture plates (Corning) and incubated overnight, followed by replacement of 200 \u03bcL serum-free medium containing 106 PFU (multiplicity of infection [M.O.I] = 10) IFV. After 1 h incubation, the unabsorbed viruses were removed and the cells were incubated for a further 24 h in serum-containing medium. BMMFs were also stimulated with LPS (100 ng/mL), poly I:C (10 \u03bcg/mL), or imiquimod (5 \u03bcg/mL) for 24 h in serum-containing medium. For chemical reagent treatments, BMMFs were incubated with 2-DG (100 \u03bcg/mL), oligomycin (5 \u03bcg/mL), AICAR (1 mM) or BAY 11-7082 (15 \u03bcM) for 1 h prior to virus stimulation. The culture supernatants were assayed for IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and CCL2/MCP-1 by ELISA.\n\nTotal RNA was extracted from cells using the ReliaPrep RNA Cell Miniprep System (Promega, Madison, WI) and cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript II (Life Technologies) and random primers. The RT products were then subjected to qPCR in a 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (ABI) and specific primers for each gene. The PCR products were sequenced and their homogeneity was confirmed by monitoring the dissociation temperature of SYBR green I fluorescence. Primer sequences were as follows: mouse Il6, forward, 5\u2032-TAG TCC TTC CTA CCC CAA TTT CC-3\u2032, and reverse, 5\u2032-TTG GTC CTT AGC CAC TCC TTC-3\u2032; Tnf, forward, 5\u2032-AAG CCT GTA GCC CAC GTC GTA-3\u2032, and reverse, 5\u2032-GGC ACC ACT AGT TGG TTG TCT TTG-3\u2032; Ccl2, forward, 5\u2032-CCC CAA GAA GGA ATG GGT CC-3\u2032, and reverse, 5\u2032-GGT TGT GGA AAA GGT AGT GG-3\u2032; and Actb, forward, 5\u2032-AGA TCA AGA TCA TTG CTC CTC CT-3\u2032, and reverse, 5\u2032-ACG CAG CTC AGT AAC AGT CC-3\u2032.\n\nBMMFs were prepared as described above and stimulated with IFV (M.O.I. = 10). After 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 h of incubation, the BMMFs were harvested with a cell scraper. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction of BMMFs was performed using the Nuclear Extract Kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacturer instruction.\n\nNuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to membrane filters, and analysed by immunoblotting with a rabbit anti-NF-\u03baBp65 antibody (clone D14E12), a mouse anti-IKK\u03b1 antibody (clone 3G12), a rabbit anti-IKK\u03b2 antibody (clone D30C6), a rabbit anti-phospho-IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 (Ser176/180) antibody (clone 16A6), a mouse anti-I\u03baB\u03b1 antibody (clone L35A5), a rabbit anti-phospho-I\u03baB\u03b1 (Ser32) antibody (clone 14D4), a rabbit anti-AMPK\u03b1 antibody (clone D63G4), a rabbit anti-phospho-AMPK\u03b1 (Thr172) antibody (clone 40H9) (all obtained from Cell Signaling Technology), a mouse anti-lamin A/C antibody (clone 3A6-4C11, Active Motif), or a mouse anti-\u03b2-actin antibody (Merck Millipore).\n\nBMMFs were prepared as described above and stimulated with IFV (M.O.I. = 10). After 2, 4, and 6 h of incubation, the BMMFs were harvested with a cell scraper. ATP levels were determined using the ATP bioluminescence assay kit CLS II (Roche Applied Science, Upper Bavaria, Germany) as previously described2627. ATP levels were normalized to the total protein concentration as determined using a Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).\n\nSurvival curves were generated by the Kaplan-Meier method and statistical analyses were performed using the log-rank test. The statistical significance was assessed by Student\u2019s t-tests. A P value < 0.05 was considered significant.\n\nHow to cite this article: Uematsu, T. et al.
