{"title": "Knockdown of Drosha in human alveolar type II cells alters expression of SP-A in culture: a pilot study NIH Public Access", "body": "Surfactant protein A (SP-A) is synthesized and secreted in the lung by alveolar type II cells (ATII), one of the two cell types of the distal alveolar epithelium (ATII and ATI) (1, 2) . Two homologous genes encode human SP-A: SFTPA1 (SP-A1) and SFTPA2 (SP-A2). Based on sequence differences at the coding region, several coding variants have been identified and characterized for SP-A1 and SP-A2, some of which have been associated with lung disease susceptibility and/or pathogenesis in neonates, children, and adults (3) . We have previously reported biochemical and functional differences among SP-A1 and SP-A2 variants in several experimental models (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . We have also shown that the ratio of SP-A1 to total SP-A protein is altered in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of subjects with lung disease vs. healthy individuals, indicating that the overall SP-A functional activity may depend on the relative amounts of SP-A1 and SP-A2 gene products (14, 15) . Together, these findings indicate that a controlled regulation of SP-A1 and SP-A2 expression is critical to maintain lung homeostasis and prevent disease.\n\nThe specific mechanisms that regulate expression of human SP-A1 and SP-A2 are still not well understood. Previous work from our laboratory has demonstrated that differential regulation of SP-A variants occurs at both transcriptional and translational levels (16) (17) (18) (19) . Recently, using the NCI-H441 cell line, we have reported that differential miRNA regulation of SP-A variants depends on sequence polymorphisms at the 3\u2032UTR of SP-A variants (20) . However, differences may exist in the physiology, regulatory pathways, and overall gene expression between NCI H441 and ATII cells. Thus, a more physiologically relevant model is needed to elucidate and/or confirm the molecular mechanisms that control the expression of SP-A. We aim to accomplish this by using primary cultures of human ATII cells from lung donors.\n\nIn previous studies, investigators have successfully purified and cultured ATII from various animal models, and have demonstrated that the optimal culture conditions are different for ATII cells obtained from mouse, rat, and human (21, 22) . Moreover, human ATII cells have been shown to trans-differentiate to alveolar type I cells (ATI) in cultures from various species (23, 24) . Differentiation of ATII to ATI can be detected by changes in the overall cell morphology, the loss of lamellar bodies (detected by modified Papanicolaou staining, ultrastructure analysis, etc.), or by detection of molecular markers that allow the identification of these two distinct cell types (25) . The most commonly used ATII cell specific markers are: Surfactant Protein C (STPC), ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A, member 3 (ABCA3), and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1); whereas the molecular markers commonly used for identification of ATI are Caveolin-1 (CAV1), T1\u03b1 (PDPN), Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE), and Aquaporin-5 (AQP-5) (2, 26, 27) .\n\nThe goal of this study was to define the role of miRNAs in the regulation of SP-A expression in human ATII cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are recently discovered small noncoding RNAs that control gene expression via translation suppression by binding sequence motifs on mRNA 3\u2032UTRs. MiRNA biogenesis initiates in the nucleus, where precursors (pri-miRNAs) are transcribed by the RNA polymerase II, and processed onto pre-miRNAs via cleavage by a complex of enzymes including Drosha (28) . Pre-miRNAs are transported by exportin-5 to the cytosol, where further processing by the ribonuclease Dicer results in double-stranded 19-25nt molecules containing the mature miRNA (miR), and the complimentary miRNA (miR*). The mature miR interacts with the mRNA target by sequence complementarity of the seed region (7 8nt) to the 3\u2032UTR. The miR-mRNA complex interacts with proteins of the Argonaut family leading to the assembly of the RNAinduced silencing complex (RISC) (28) . The degree of sequence complementarity between miRNA and mRNA targets is known to determine whether repression of protein expression is mediated by mRNA degradation (perfect match), or inhibition of translation (imperfect match) (29) .\n\nDue to their multiple target potential, miRNAs have been identified as powerful regulators of a wide spectrum of biological functions, including cell cycle, apoptosis, cell differentiation, and development (30) . Furthermore, extracellular secretion of miRNAs has been demonstrated and studied extensively as a novel mechanism of cell regulation and communication (31) . Numerous studies have shown that expression of intracellular and secreted miRNAs is altered during the progression of a variety of human diseases, indicating that miRNAs are involved in the control of important physiological processes, and may play a role in the pathogenesis and resolution of disease (32) .\n\nIn the present study, we have isolated and cultured ATII cells from a human lung donor, and have characterized the alveolar epithelial cell phenotype under different culture conditions to investigate mechanisms of miRNA regulation of human SP-A1 and SP-A2 gene variants. By using a knockdown approach to inhibit miRNA biogenesis, we provide evidence that miRNAs regulate expression of SP-A. Moreover, we show for the first time that differences exist in the miRNA cellular content of human ATII and ATI cultured cells. Our findings support the notion that differential expression of miRNAs may regulate respiratory functions not only through regulation of SP-A gene expression, but also differentiation of alveolar epithelial cells, as well as point to a possible role of miRNAs in SP-A downregulation in ATI cells.\n\nHuman ATII cells were isolated from a donor lung (The Gift of Life Donor Program, Philadelphia, PA) by modification of previously published protocols (22, 33, 34) . All procedures were approved by the Penn State College of Medicine Institutional Review Board. The lung was lavaged, instilled with 12.9U/ml elastase (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 50min. The tissue was homogeneized, filtered, and treated with DNAase (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Cell depletion was performed with anti-CD-14 magnetic beads (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and by incubation with IgG (Sigma) on petri dishes, followed by treatment with RBC lysis buffer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). ATII cells were suspended in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 2mM glutamine, 2.5\u03bcg/ml amphotericin B, 100\u03bcg/ml streptomycin, penicillin G and gentamicin (D 10 ). Cell purity was confirmed by Papanicolaou stain and electron microscopy (35) . The lung donor was a 20 year old male with the SP-A1/SP-A2 haplotype 6A 2 6A 3 /1A 0 1A 1 .\n\nCells were cultured as described elsewhere (34, 36) . ATII were plated at a density of 1x10 6 cells/well in 12-well plates with Minicell inserts pre-coated with a mixture of matrigel (65%) (BD Biosciences) and rat tail collagen (35%) (BD Biosciences) (air-liquid interface, A/L). A second set of cells was plated directly in wells (plastic, P). Cells were incubated for 48h at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 , and the medium was switched to KIA: DMEM containing 1% charcoal stripped FBS, 10ng/ml keratinocyte growth factor (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN), 0.1mM isubutylmethylxanthine (Sigma), and 0.1mM 8-Br-cAMP (Sigma). One day later, the medium was switched to KIA supplemented with 10nM dexamethasone (KIAD) to enhance expression of surfactant proteins (37, 38) , and the cells were maintained in culture for two more days. Cells were harvested daily, and expression of cell markers was determined.\n\nCells were plated and incubated in A/L for 48h. Medium was switched to KIA, and cell transfection was performed with the GenomONE\u2122-Neo EX HVJ Envelope transfection kit (Cosmo Bio, Carlsbard, CA) and stealth siRNA RNAi: Drosha (50nM), negative control med-GC (50nM), and Block-it Fluorescent oligo (10nM) (Life technologies). Cells were harvested 48h and 72h post-transfection.\n\nCells were harvested by addition of RIPA buffer. Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Thermo, Rockford, IL). Western blots were performed in 30\u03bcg (A/L) or 2.5\u03bcg (P) of total protein with the following: an SP-A antibody that recognizes SP-A1 and SP-A2 (14) , pro-SP-B and pro-SP-C antibodies (Seven Hills bioreagents, Cincinnati, OH), Drosha (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), and GAPDH (Millipore, Billerica, MA).\n\nCells were harvested with Trizol (Life Technologies). Total RNA was purified with the Direct-zol\u2122 RNA-MiniPrep-kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). RNA concentration and quality were confirmed by nanodrop and Bioanalyzer. Expression of SP-A1, SP-A2, SP-B, SP-C, SP-D, ABCA3, CAV1, PDPN, RAGE and Drosha was detected by Real Time PCR with TaqMan assays (Life Technologies). Results were analyzed by relative quantification and normalized to 18s (39) .\n\nmiRNAs were purified from A/L and P cultured cells with the miRVana miRNA isolation kit (Life Technologies). Expression of 1,066 miRNAs was determined with the Human miRNome miRNA PCR Array (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) in ATI and ATII cells (n=3). Data analysis was performed with the manufacturer's software and the TAM software (40) . Prediction analysis for miRNA binding to SP-A1 and SP-A2 3\u2032UTRs was performed by TargetScan.\n\nHuman ATII cells were obtained from one lung transplant donor, as described previously (22, 33) . The cell purity was confirmed by Papanicolaou staining, and by ultrastructural visualization of lamellar bodies (Supplementary Figure 1 ). Cells were plated in cell inserts covered with a mix of matrigel/rat tail collagen (air-liquid interface, A/L), or directly in wells without matrix (P), and maintained in culture for five days, as depicted on Figure 1A . Cells were harvested daily, and the expression of surfactant protein A (SP-A), and precursors of surfactant proteins B, and C (proSP-B, pro-SPC) was monitored by Western blotting ( Figure 1B ). Cells cultured in A/L showed increased levels of all three proteins over time in cells cultured in A/L, reaching maximum levels on day 4 and 5, consistent with ATII phenotype. On the other hand, cells cultured in P showed a decrease in SP-A expression over time. ProSP-B levels decreased on D2 and D3 vs. D1, and slightly increased following addition of dexamethasone (Dex) to the culture media. We did not observe significant changes in proSP-C during D1-D3, however a slight increase was observed on D4, followed by a decrease on D5 ( Figure 1B) .\n\nAt the mRNA level, cells cultured in A/L had significantly higher expression of SP-A1 on D2 compared to D1, and these levels were maintained over time (Supplementary Figure 2) . SP-A2 expression, however, only showed a significant increase on D4 and D5, i.e. after addition of Dex. These results are in support of previous findings on differential regulation of the two SP-A genes (41) (42) (43) . Expression of SFTPB (SP-B), SFTPC (SP-C) and SFTPD (SP-D) mRNAs was also significantly higher on D4 and D5 in A/L cultures. On the other hand, ATII cells cultured in P showed a significant decrease in the mRNA expression of all surfactant protein genes over time, and these were not affected by the addition of Dex (Supplementary Figure 2) . Together, these results indicate that ATII cells are able to maintain the phenotype over time when cultured in A/L, as shown previously (34, 36) , and represent a suitable experimental model for the study of surfactant protein expression.\n\nWe next analyzed the expression of known ATII and ATI molecular markers in order to confirm the cell phenotype in both culture conditions. For this, we measured the mRNA levels of one ATII cell marker, the ATP-binding cassette 3 sub-family A, member 3 (ABCA3), and three ATI specific markers: caveolin-1 (CAV1), T1-\u03b1/podoplanin (PDPN), and the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE) in cells cultured in A/L or P. Expression of ABCA3 was significantly higher on D2 and maintained over time in A/L cultures (Supplementary Figure 3) . The levels of the ATI specific markers were decreased over time, indicating a selection of ATII cells occurs under these conditions. However, in cells cultured in P, ABCA3 mRNA significantly decreased over time, as previously observed for the expression of surfactant proteins ( Supplementary Figures 2 and 3 ).\n\nPrevious studies have reported trans-differentiation of cultured ATII to ATI cells (23, 44) . As expected, in cells cultured in P, a significant increase in the mRNA levels of CAV1 and PDPN was observed on D4 and D5, and RAGE expression was significantly higher on D3, D4, and D5. Together, these results indicate that, in our model, cells maintained on A/L for 5 days may represent primarily an ATII population, whereas P cultures may represent predominantly ATI cells, and/or cell intermediates (i.e. transitioning from ATII to ATI cells).\n\nFollowing characterization of the culture, we inhibited the expression of Drosha, a nuclear ribonuclease critical for miRNA maturation, by transfection of ATII cells cultured in A/L, with stealth siRNAs. Efficient delivery of siRNAs was confirmed by microscopic visualization of a fluorescent oligonucleotide (Figure 2A) , and knockdown of Drosha was confirmed by Real Time PCR analysis and Western Blot at 48h and 72h post-transfection ( Figure 2B ). We found that Drosha mRNA levels were reduced significantly (50% and 70%, respectively) when compared with levels of cells transfected with a control siRNA. Similarly, Drosha protein expression was reduced at 72h following siRNA transfection ( Figure 2C ).\n\nIn order to analyze the effects of Drosha knockdown on SP-A expression, we transfected ATII cells on D2 in A/L, and cells were harvested at 48h and 72h post-transfection (D4 and D5) ( Figure 3A ). We measured the expression of SP-A1 and SP-A2 mRNA levels ( Figure  3B ) and total SP-A protein ( Figure 3C ) by Real Time PCR and Western blot, respectively. We observed that 48h and 72h after transfection with Drosha siRNA, cells expressed significantly higher levels of SP-A1 and SP-A2 mRNAs, as well as total SP-A protein than cells transfected with the control siRNA. Similar results were observed for SP-A mRNA expression when cells were treated with siRNAs that target enzymes downstream of Drosha in the miRNA maturation pathway (Dicer and Argonaut-2) (Figure 4) . Furthermore, expression of surfactant proteins B, C (mRNA and protein precursor levels) and D (mRNA) was also increased following knockdown of Drosha (Supplementary Figure 4) .\n\nNext, in order to characterize the miRNA content of ATII and ATI cells in our model, we harvested cells cultured on A/L and P on D5, and extracted the small RNA fraction. By using the Human miRNome miRNA PCR Array (QIAGEN), we characterized the expression of 1,066 human miRNAs and compared differences in expression between the two cell models. Expression of 451 miRNAs was detected in ATII cells, and of 615 miRNAs in ATI cells (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2) . We have also identified distinct miRNA expression profiles for ATII and ATI cells, with higher expression of miRNAs in ATI cells (Figure 5 ), as well as miRNA signatures for the two cell types: 37 miRNAs only expressed in ATII cells, and 180 miRNAs exclusively expressed in ATI cells (Table 1) . Prediction target analysis using the online tool TargetScan showed that eleven miRNAs exclusively expressed in ATII cells were predicted to bind SP-A transcripts (3 for SP-A1, 3 for SP-A2, and 5 for both genes), and 52 miRNAs expressed only in ATI cells had predicted binding to SP-A 3\u2032UTRs (14 for SP-A1, 13 for SP-A2, and 15 for both genes) ( Table 2) . Finally, quantitative analysis revealed that 24 of the miRNAs expressed in ATI and ATII cells had a significantly higher expression in ATI vs. ATII cells (p<0.05), and half of them were predicted to bind SP-A 3\u2032UTR sequences (5 miRNAs for SP-A1, 4 miRNAs for SP-A2, and 2 miRNAs for both genes) ( Table 3 ).\n\nAlveolar type II cells synthesize and secrete surfactant, a lipoprotein complex essential for life. Surfactant protein A, the most abundant protein of this complex, plays an important role in innate immunity, and its function appears to be dependent on the relative content of two gene products (SP-A1 and SP-A2) (14, 15, 45) . Using in vitro models, we have previously identified several regulatory mechanisms that control SP-A1 and SP-A2 expression. Here, we have characterized a physiologically relevant model to study and validate important findings on SP-A regulation, with emphasis on miRNA regulatory pathways. In addition, we characterized ATII cells cultured in two different conditions, by measuring expression of surfactant proteins, ATII and ATI cell markers, and miRNAs. We identified differentially expressed miRNAs in ATI vs. ATII cells that could potentially serve as cell markers of ATI and ATII cells.\n\nPrimary culture of human ATII cells represents a powerful tool that can be used for the study of SP-A expression, and/or to confirm key findings obtained from the current available models that include animal fetal lung explants, lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, and stably transfected cell lines (16, 17, 20, 41, (46) (47) (48) . Our goal here was to develop a model that will allow the study of the regulation of human SP-A variants in a physiologically relevant system (i.e. in a normal, non cancerous cell model where SP-A is naturally expressed). We used a combination of published protocols and techniques to obtain ATII cells from a donor lung, and tested two cell culture conditions that resulted in two distinct phenotypes after 5 days. In A/L cultures, addition of keratinocyte growth factor, isubutylmethylxanthine, and 8-Br-cAMP resulted in increased levels of total SP-A. Media supplementation with Dex, on the other hand, significantly increased mRNA and protein levels of all surfactant proteins. These changes were not observed in cells cultured in the absence of matrix (P). These results were not unexpected, as both matrigel (primarily composed of Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor matrix), and rat tail collagen have been shown to stimulate synthesis and secretion of surfactant phospholipids and maintainance of SPA expression in cultured ATII cells (22, 49, 50) .\n\nTrans-differentiation of ATII to ATI was previously reported in murine cell models, as a spontaneous process that occurs in culture (44, 51) . Currently, the mechanisms involved in this process are unknown, although recent studies have identified a role of TGF-\u03b2, and bone morphogenic protein (BPM) signaling pathways in the control of the trans-differentiation rate (44) . In the present study, we have shown that ATII cells cultured for 5 days in plastic wells are able to trans-differentiate to ATI, as indicated by surfactant protein expression and three ATI specific markers, and cell morphology consistent with the ATI phenotype. In addition, we have shown differences in the expression of miRNAs in ATII and ATI cells ( Table 1 ), indicating that miRNAs could play a role in the trans-differentiation process, by affecting the regulation of multiple genes, as it has been previously shown for bronchial epithelial cell differentiation (52) . It is also possible that the differential miRNA composition of ATI and ATII cells, as well as the differential expression rates for the 24 miRNAs identified (Table 3 ) may represent a novel molecular marker for identification of these two distinct cell phenotypes. Moreover, given the fact that a number of miRNAs that were highly expressed in ATI vs. ATII cells were predicted to bind SP-A 3\u2032UTRs, it is possible that these pay a role in the downregulation of SP-A1 and SP-A2 in the ATI phenotype.\n\nMicroRNA biosynthesis is a well-regulated event that involves multiple processing steps facilitated by a number of enzymes. The nuclear protein Drosha is a key regulator of this process, as its cleavage of miRNA precursors allows them to enter the cytosol and continue the miRNA biogenesis process. Therefore, by depleting Drosha from ATII cells, one can decrease the miRNA biogenesis rate, and thus minimize the effects of mature miRNAs in the cell. In the current study, we successfully inhibited the expression of Drosha by using a siRNA-mediated approach in ATII cells maintained in A/L, and were able to show for the first time that a) ATII cells can be efficiently transfected in cell monolayers; b) knock-down of Drosha results in significantly higher mRNA and protein levels of surfactant proteins, indicating that miRNAs are involved (directly or indirectly) in the regulation of surfactant protein expression, and c) alveolar epithelial type I and II cells differentially express miRNAs predicted to regulate the expression of SP-A genes. Future research is needed to confirm the mechanisms by which miRNAs affect SP-A translation and mRNA stability.\n\nMicroRNAs are powerful regulators of gene expression, as they have the ability of controlling multiple targets simultaneously, and affect various cellular functions and biological processes, including cell differentiation in various tissues (53) (54) (55) (56) . In the present study, the miRNA profile of ATII cells was significantly different from that of ATI cells after 5 days in culture ( Figure 5 ). Qualitative analysis revealed 37 ATII-specific miRNAs and 180 specific for ATI cells (Table 1) , and differential expression of 24 miRNAs in ATI vs. ATII (Table 3) . Together, these indicate a role of miRNAs in ATII and ATI phenotypes. In order to determine some of the regulatory pathways that may be under the control of these miRNAs, we used the online Tool for Annotations of miRNAs (TAM) (40) to evaluate associations of differentially expressed miRNAs with various biological functions. Among the miRNAs with exclusive expression in ATII cells, two (hsa-mir-92a, hsa-mir-19b) belong to the hsa-mir-17-92 family, previously shown to inhibit lung epithelial cell differentiation (57) . Furthermore, fourteen miRNAs with exclusive expression in ATI cells are members of the hsa-mir-1185 cluster (hsa-mir-134, hsa-mir-299-5p, hsa-mir-329, hsa-mir-369-3p, hsa-mir-376b, hsa-mir-377, hsa-mir-379, hsa-mir-380, hsa-mir-411, hsa-mir-485-3p, hsamir-487a, hsa-mir-495, hsa-mir-543, hsa-mir-668), indicating that they are likely to share common expression patterns, regulation of transcription and processing of pri-miRNA precursors, and regulatory functions (58, 59) . However, the underlying mechanisms for these putative functions are currently unknown. Finally, of the 24 commonly expressed miRNAs with differential expression in ATI and ATII, five were predicted to bind SP-A1 3\u2032UTRs (hsa-mir-181a-2-3p, hsa-mir-182-5p, hsa-mir-370-5p, hsa-mir-373-5p, hsamir-3907), four were predicted to bind SP-A2 3\u2032UTRs (hsa-mir-214-3p, hsa-mir-30a-5p, hsa-mir-30d-5p, hsa-mir-30e-5p), and two (hsa-mir-126-3p, hsa-mir-429) were predicted to bind regulatory sequences of both SP-A1 and SP-A2 genes. These observations indicate that an increase in the expression of these miRNAs in ATI cells may contribute to the inhibition of expression of SP-A1 and SP-A2 in cells cultured in plastic. Furthermore, TAM analysis of the 24 differentially expressed miRNAs in Table 3 revealed that two (hsa-mir-15a-5p, hsa-mir-424-5p), and three (hsa-mir-15a-5p, hsa-mir-21-3p, hsa-mir-373-5p) were associated with cell differentiation and cell proliferation, respectively. Seven miRNAs (hsamir-21-3p hsa-mir-29a-5p, hsa-mir-30a-5p, hsa-mir-30d-5p, hsa-mir-30e-5p, hsamir-370-3p, and hsa-mir-429) were associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and two (hsa-mir-96-5p, hsa-mir-182-5p) with cell fate determination. This analysis also identified miRNAs related to apoptosis (hsa-mir-15a-5p, hsa-mir-21-3p, hsa-mir-29a-5p, hsa-mir-96-5p, hsa-mir-181a-2-3p, hsa-mir-182-5p), and cell death (hsa-mir-21-3p, hsamir-30d-5p, hsa-mir-130b-3p, hsa-mir-181a-2-3p, hsa-mir-182-5p). Together, these predictions indicate that multiple biological pathways may be contributing to the ATII to ATI differentiation process observed in our model, and miRNAs may play an important role in the control of these functions, by regulation of specific gene expression. Further analyses on miRNA-mRNA pathways, as well as functional analysis of miRNA-gene interactions may reveal specific regulatory mechanisms involved in the control of alveolar cell differentiation, and determine whether these miRNAs could be used as biomarkers for alveolar cell differentiation in vivo. A limitation of the present study is that the alveolar epithelial cells studied were derived from a single lung of a young donor, with a specific SP-A1 and SP-A2 genotype. It is possible that lungs from older donors and different SP-A1 and SP-A2 genotypes may behave slightly different in terms of the parameters measured here.\n\nIn summary, we characterized isolated human alveolar cells in culture under two different conditions, and we studied the role of miRNAs in SP-A gene expression, and trans differentiation of ATII to ATI cells cultured in vitro. Our results provide novel data on the miRNA profile of ATII and ATI cells, and the potential role of miRNAs as master regulators of mediating both differentiation of alveolar epithelial cells, as well as expression of SP-A1 and SP-A2 genes during trans-differentiation.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.
