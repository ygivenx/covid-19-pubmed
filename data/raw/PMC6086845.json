{"title": "Factors associated with recovery delay in a sample of patients diagnosed by MERS\u2010CoV rRT\u2010PCR: A Saudi Arabian multicenter retrospective study", "body": "Laboratory\u2010confirmed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV) has been documented in more than 2000 cases worldwide, causing 722 related deaths from September 2012 through September 2017.1 Much research evidence is available on factors associated with a poor prognosis in laboratory\u2010confirmed MERS\u2010CoV2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and non\u2010MERS\u2010CoV9, 10, 11 patients. A high mortality rate was systematically recognized in MERS\u2010CoV patients of old age,2, 12, 13, 14, 15 severe illness,2, 12, 13, 14 underlying condition,2, 12, 13, 14 and respiratory/gastrointestinal symptoms.2 However, successful management of MERS\u2010CoV such as clinical recovery and its predictors has not been given sufficient attention despite the virus having been in circulation since 2012.\n\nAs per the authors\u2019 knowledge, two studies have so far addressed clinical improvement on laboratory\u2010confirmed MERS\u2010CoV patients.16, 17 The first study, Shalhoub et al,16 was based on a case report in which their observations may not be generalized to a wider MERS\u2010CoV population. The second study, Al\u2010Turaiki et al,17 utilized publicly available data from the Saudi Ministry of Health. The major shortcomings in their study were several potential confounding factors such as underlying medical conditions and a primary or secondary mode of MERS\u2010CoV transmission that had not been included in the analysis. In addition, the recovery delay was not reported in their study, and thus, factors related to the recovery delay were not examined.\n\nAs of October 4, 2017, there was no available detailed data on recovery delay of laboratory\u2010confirmed MERS\u2010CoV and non\u2010MERS\u2010CoV patients. Data on the time intervals between a patient's presentation or admission to a healthcare facility and the first specimen sample have been limited in patients suspected and screened for MERS\u2010CoV by a real\u2010time reverse\u2010transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT\u2010PCR) test, as it might correlate with recovery delay intervals.\n\nEarly screening and diagnosis of MERS\u2010CoV could greatly promote proper control and clinical management of cases, which may reduce the risk of transmission and increase the chance of successful outcomes.18, 19, 20 This study provides more understanding of how long a period (in days) it may take to recover from MERS\u2010CoV infection. The authors have studied, retrospectively, a cohort of survivors\u2014laboratory\u2010confirmed MERS\u2010CoV and non\u2010MERS\u2010CoV patients\u2014to estimate recovery delay intervals and identify possible associated factors in Saudi Arabia. The authors assessed whether the time interval between presentation and the initial rRT\u2010PCR diagnosis (diagnosis delay) correlates with the time interval between initial rRT\u2010PCR diagnosis and recovery (recovery delay). We hypothesized that older age, MERS\u2010CoV infection, ICU admission, and abnormal radiology findings might be associated with longer recovery delay. We hypothesized that diagnosis delay might positively correlate with a recovery delay.\n\nThe analysis was conducted using IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) (24; SPSS, Chicago, IL). Patients\u2019 characteristics were described by count and percent, and mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) or median where appropriate. Time intervals in days from presentation to initial rRT\u2010PCR diagnosis (diagnosis delay) and from initial rRT\u2010PCR diagnosis to recovery (recovery delay) were analyzed by Spearman's correlation coefficient.\n\nThe Poisson and negative binomial models were used to model the frequency of recovery delay in days and identify unadjusted and adjusted factors associated with longer recovery delay. Goodness\u2010of\u2010fit measures were used to compare and identify the best model. The model with the smaller deviance, larger Log likelihood, smaller Akaike information criterion, and smaller Bayesian information criterion was considered the better model. In all analyses, a P\u2010value of less than 5% was considered significant. Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to assess the strength of association between patients\u2019 characteristics and longer/shorter recovery delay.\n\nA total of 396 patients, suspected and screened for MERS\u2010CoV by an rRT\u2010PCR test, were analyzed. The average age was 46 years with age ranges between 1 and 95 years. The median recovery delay in our sample was 5 days. Of the sample, 57.7% were male and 18.4% were admitted to ICU. Fever and respiratory symptoms were common presentations, occurring in 66.3% and 84.1% of the patients, respectively. The chest X\u2010ray and/or CT scan were abnormal in almost half of the samples (48.4%). Refer to Table 1 for other sample parameters. The longer delays in diagnosis were positively correlated with longer recovery delay (r = .421; P = .001).\n\nAccording to univariate negative binomial regression analysis (Table 2), shorter recovery delay was noted in patients with camel contact (relative risk (RR) = 0.134; 95% CI: 0.045\u20100.398). The univariate analysis showed longer recovery delay in elderly patients (65 years or over) (RR = 1.343; 95% CI: 1.069\u20101.686), patients with MERS\u2010CoV infection (RR = 2.556; 95% CI: 1.895\u20103.447), ICU patients (RR = 2.915; 95% CI: 2.239\u20103.794), patients with abnormal radiology findings (RR = 2.016; 95% CI: 1.612\u20102.521), patients with diabetes (RR = 1.356; 95% CI: 1.092\u20101.683), patients with renal disease (RR = 1.454; 95% CI: 1.048\u20102.018), and patients with hypertension (RR = 1.440; 95% CI: 1.160\u20101.788).\n\nA multivariate negative binomial regression analysis (Table 2) revealed six independent factors that affect the recovery delay. Camel contact (adjusted relative risk (aRR)  = 0.267; 95% CI: 0.083\u20100.855) (Figure 1) and respiratory symptoms (RR = 0.537; 95% CI: 0.387\u20100.745) were major independent factors associated with shorter recovery delay. Elderly (65 years or over) (RR = 1.741; 95% CI: 1.276\u20102.374), MERS\u2010CoV infection (RR = 2.138; 95% CI: 1.378\u20103.318) (Figure 2), ICU admission (RR = 2.048; 95% CI: 1.450\u20102.892), and abnormal radiology findings (RR = 1.473; 95% CI: 1.144\u20101.896) (Figure 3) were associated with longer recovery delay.\n\nWe compared goodness\u2010of\u2010fit measures between the negative binomial and the Poisson models. The goodness\u2010of\u2010fit measures indicate that the negative binomial model fits the data better than the Poisson model. The negative binomial model had smaller deviance (1.05 vs. 6.70), larger Log likelihood (\u22121031.54 vs. \u22121649.60), smaller Akaike information criterion (2095.08 vs. 3331.19), and smaller Bayesian information criterion (2156.66 vs. 3392.78) than the Poisson model.\n\nThis is the first study identifying predictors of recovery delay (in days) in a large sample of laboratory\u2010confirmed MERS\u2010CoV and non\u2010MERS\u2010CoV patients. Despite recovery delay being an important indicator of MERS\u2010CoV infection progression, it remains poorly understood in this population. The data were collected from two of the largest tertiary hospitals in Saudi Arabia: KAMC\u2010R and KFGH\u2010JED from September 2012 to June 2016.\n\nAccording to our research, evidence suggests that there are a number of factors that affect the course of recovery delay in suspected MERS\u2010CoV patients whose clinical samples were evaluated by the rRT\u2010PCR test. Older age (65 years or over) was a major predictor of longer recovery delay in our sample. This was noted by Al\u2010Turaiki et al, as well.17 In other recent studies, being of older age was a factor for worse clinical outcomes such as infection severity13 and death2, 13, 14 in MERS\u2010CoV patients. This age group has been linked to a number of pre\u2010existing medical conditions and other health risks which can also increase the risk of longer recovery delay in this population. It is essential that the healthcare practitioners who provide direct medical care to suspected MERS\u2010CoV patients most carefully monitor infection development to avoid poor outcomes in elderly patients.\n\nAs expected, the risk of longer recovery delay was twice as high in patients with MERS\u2010CoV infection than patients without MERS\u2010CoV infection. This finding could be attributed to several factors. MERS\u2010CoV is a serious illness and is very common in patients in the older age group2, 12, 13, 14, 15 and patients with pre\u2010existing medical conditions,2, 11, 12, 13, 14 and these seem to increase the risk of early mortality after diagnosis.2 Furthermore, most MERS\u2010CoV patients develop severe pneumonia22 and necessitate mechanical ventilation,11 which is a risk factor for hospital mortality.23\n\n\nPatients admitted to ICU admission were at higher risk for longer recovery delay. A previous report showing similar findings, longer ICU stay, and high mortality rate was reported in MERS\u2010CoV patients who were admitted to the ICU.24 Such patients would benefit from monitoring their responses to medical support and recognizing potential complications at an early stage.\n\nWe found that camel contact was associated with shorter recovery delay. Studies on recovery delay in patients with camel contact as compared to close contact exposure of a confirmed case or other exposure are lacking; however, camel contact has also been linked to lower 3\u2010 and 30\u2010day mortality rates in MERS\u2010CoV patients.2 This important association requires more studies to identify whether camel contact is an independent protective factor of shorter recovery delay.\n\nIn our study, patients with respiratory symptoms are more likely to experience shorter recovery delay than patients without respiratory symptoms. This finding is probably related to the shorter lag time between symptom onset and diagnosis, in which patients with presence of symptoms could be positively affected by an early diagnosis18 and thus prompt medical support is deemed necessary.\n\nThe time interval from presentation to initial rRT\u2010PCR diagnosis (diagnosis delay) was positively correlated with the time interval from initial rRT\u2010PCR diagnosis to recovery (recovery delay). Early diagnosis is likely to improve clinical outcomes18 and reduce the economic and physical burden of a disease.25, 26 Early diagnosis requires full utilization of hospital resources. Individuals at high risk of MERS\u2010CoV infection should be promptly screened after arrival at the healthcare facility, monitored for progression, and then having a prompt decision made for whether further rRT\u2010PCR testing is needed.\n\nThe authors noticed the following limitations. First, the study was based on chart reviews, and findings should be interpreted with caution. Second, we did not collect information on the type of antiviral treatment or other supportive treatments given after diagnosis which may have affected clinical outcomes.27, 28 Third, despite this being the first investigation in this population, including a number of potential predictors for recovery delay, additional relevant predictors should be explored, such as the level of camel exposure, for example, hospital\u2010acquired infections. Fourth, patients with clinical recovery were identified by reviewing the medical records of the study sample within 60 days after the initial rRT\u2010PCR diagnosis. Studies with longer periods of follow\u2010up in a larger population recovering from MERS\u2010CoV are warranted to assess the long\u2010term successful clinical outcomes.\n\nDespite the mentioned limitations, data were aggregated directly from medical charts rather than public source databases. This chart review study was based on information from multicenters and a large sample size, and it provides valuable information on factors associated with prolonged or shorter recovery delay of patients suspected and screened for MERS\u2010CoV by the rRT\u2010PCR test. It is essential to develop interventional programs or guidelines to ensure early diagnosis, as this may reduce recovery delay intervals as well as improve patients\u2019 clinical outcomes. This research may enable identification of patients who require receiving appropriate medical support and care according to their illness progression. This also may prevent spread and transmission of the infection as individuals who are still severely ill can be appropriately isolated and managed apart from others who are responding to medical care.\n\nThe study evidence supports that longer recovery delay was seen in patients with older age, MERS\u2010CoV infection, ICU admission, and abnormal radiology findings in a sample of patients diagnosed by rRT\u2010PCR. Recovery delay was significantly shorter in patients who had camel contact and respiratory symptoms at presentation. A prospective study is needed to evaluate the impact of camel exposure on recovery. Evidence was found of an increasing recovery delay with a longer diagnosis delay. The findings may help understand clinical decision making as it directs hospital resources toward prompt screening, monitoring, and implementing clinical recovery and treatment strategies.\n\nThere are no conflict of interests."}
