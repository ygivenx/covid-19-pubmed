{"title": "Anti-Norovirus Therapeutics: A Patent Review (2010-2015)", "body": "Human noroviruses are the principal cause of non-bacterial acute gastroenteritis worldwide [1] [2] [3] [4] . It is estimated that noroviruses are responsible for 19-21 million infections, 56000- \n\nThe authors were supported by the National Institutes of Health under grant number R01AI109039. The authors have no other relevant affiliations or financial involvement with any organization or entity with a financial interest in or financial conflict with the subject matter or materials discussed in the manuscript apart from those disclosed.\n\nBecause human noroviruses do not grow in cell culture, precise understanding of the life cycle of human norovirus has remained elusive. Nevertheless, a comprehensive review of current understanding of the norovirus life cycle has been published [27] , and although many aspects of norovirus replication await sharper definition, the basic steps comprising the norovirus infection include the initial utilization of carbohydrate factors to attach to the surface of intestinal epithelial cells, followed by receptor binding and entry [29] [30] [31] . Histoblood group antigens are oligosaccharides linked to membrane bound proteins or lipids that are present on the surface of red blood cells and mucosal epithelia. They serve as attachment factors or receptors for norovirus attachment and entry. Subsequent uncoating releases the viral genome which undergoes translation via the mediation of VPg and the cellular translation machinery. The polyprotein is co-and post-translationally cleaved by norovirus 3CL pro . Formation of the replication complex is followed by genome replication. RdRp generates genomic and subgenomic RNA using both de novo and VPg-dependent initiation mechanisms [27] . The replicated genomes are then packaged into the capsid (VP1) for virion assembly and exit.\n\nEpidemic gastroenteritis mostly occurs in hospitals, nursing homes, schools, military barracks, and restaurants. The infection presents itself in the form of multiple symptoms, including diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain [9] . The infection is incapacitating but self-limiting for healthy adults, lasting 2-3 days. However, viral shedding continues much longer even after the disappearance of symptoms and can be a source of further contamination and infection. As stated earlier, the disease can be life-threatening in children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients [7] .\n\nThere is a need for a better understanding of the mechanisms by which noroviruses infect the gastrointestinal tract. Previous biopsy results, as well as studies with gnotobiotic pigs and calves infected with human norovirus, suggest that human norovirus targets intestinal epithelial cells [4, [19] [20] [21] [22] . Recent studies suggest noroviruses can infect macrophages, dendritic cells and B cells [17, [32] [33] [34] , however, it is not clear if human norovirus can target those cells in the natural host.\n\nStructural studies have shown that the norovirus capsid has a T=3 icosahedral geometry and is composed of 180 VP1s that organize into 90 dimers [35] . Each major capsid protein (VP1) is comprised of two major domains, the interior-forming shell (S) domain and the exterior protruding (P) domain, that are tethered by a flexible hinge. The P domain is further divided into two subdomains, P1 and P2, with the latter located at the outermost surface of the capsid. P2 is the least conserved region of VP1 among norovirus strains and serves as the primary site of interaction with individual oligosaccharide residues of the HBGA receptors [36] [37] [38] . As mentioned earlier, human noroviruses recognize histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) as binding ligands [31] . Recognition of histo-blood group antigens by noroviruses is known to play a pivotal role in viral infection and tropism. Structural and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) studies have illuminated further the interaction of HBGAs with noroviruses [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] . Importantly, it has been shown recently using a catchand-release electron spray ionization mass spectrometry (CaR-ESI-MS) assay [44] that human noroviruses recognize and bind to sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids with comparable affinities to those of HBGA oligosaccharide receptors [45] .\n\nThe HBGA-binding interfaces are conserved in human noroviruses, consequently, agents that block the HBGA binding site may abrogate viral infection in all norovirus strains. Toward that end, a CaR-ESI-MS assay has been used to screen carbohydrate libraries to identify norovirus ligands and potential inhibitors [46] . Related efforts involving the screening of small-molecule libraries using virus like particles (VLPs) resulted in the identification of several binding blockers [47] [48] [49] . Advances in this area are beginning to lay a solid foundation for the eventual development of virus entry inhibitors.\n\nA computer-aided drug design approach involving a) the construction and validation of computational models of the target protein based on its crystal structures with known functional HBGA binding sites, b) virtual high throughput screening of compound libraries to identify hits and, c) subsequent biochemical validation of the identified inhibitors, resulted in the identification of several compounds that blocked the binding of norovirus to HBGAs with a high affinity and displayed low cytotoxicity ( Figure 1 ) [49] . The structures of the identified compounds share in common a cyclopenta [a] phenanthrene scaffold which can be used as a launching pad for conducting structure-activity relationship studies.\n\nFollowing translation of the viral genome, the viral polyprotein is cleaved by a cysteine protease (3CL pro ) with a prototypical catalytic triad (Cys139, His30, Glu54) and a strong preference for a P1 Gln residue, to generate structural and nonstructural proteins [50] [51] [52] . Because of the central role 3CL pro plays in virus replication, this enzyme is an appealing target for the design of norovirus-specific antiviral drugs; consequently, 3CL pro has been the focus of intense studies. Using a robust FRET-based assay [53] and a cell-based replicon system [18] , an array of inhibitors of the protease displaying anti-norovirus activity have been reported, including peptidyl transition (TS) inhibitors (aldehydes, \u03b1-ketoamides, \u03b1ketoheterocycles) [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] or latent TS inhibitors [59] , and TS mimics (\u03b1hydroxyphosphonates) (vide infra) [60] . The availability of several high resolution X-ray crystal structures with bound ligands has been invaluable in using structure-guided approaches in the design of inhibitors of the enzyme [55,57,61-65].\n\naldehydes and \u03b1-ketoamides have been shown to be highly effective inhibitors of norovirus 3CL pro and norovirus in cell-based replicon cells. Peptidyl inhibitors of 3CL pro have demonstrated efficacy in the murine model of norovirus infection and are currently in preclinical development [55] . The synthesis of peptidyl derivatives of general structure (I) (Figure 2A ) can be readily accomplished as illustrated in Figure 2B and representative results are summarized in Tables 1-2. The corresponding bisulfite aldehyde adducts were also found to be an effective latent form of the aldehyde functionality which, under the conditions used, revert to the aldehyde, the actual inhibitory species, as demonstrated by Xray crystallography [57] . Peptidyl transition state mimics, such as \u03b1-hydroxyphosphonates are also effective inhibitors of norovirus 3CL pro and norovirus in cell-based replicon cells (Table 3 ) [60] . Finally, it should be noted that the substrate specificity of 3C and 3CL proteases of viruses in the picornavirus-like supercluster are very similar (Table 4) , consequently, it should in principle be possible to design broad spectrum inhibitors [57] . In addition to TS inhibitors, rupintrivir, a peptidyl inhibitor with an \u03b1, \u03b2-unsaturated ester Michael acceptor originally developed for enterovirus 3C, has been shown to be effective against noroviruses [66] . It efficiently clears human cells from their Norwalk replicon and its anti-norovirus activity is extended to murine norovirus. An additive antiviral effect is observed when rupintrivir is used in combination with polymerase inhibitors. Importantly, the cross-genotypic anti-norovirus activity displayed by rupintrivir suggests that it will most likely be effective against clinically relevant GI and GII noroviruses. Figure 3A) have been synthesized and shown to display broad-spectrum activity against viruses that belong to the picornavirus-like supercluster, which includes important human and animal pathogens such as noroviruses, enteroviruses, coronaviruses, rhinoviruses and others [67] . A representative synthesis of triazole-based macrocyclic aldehydes is shown in Figure 3B . The conformationally constrained macrocycles were found to display cellular permeability and are anticipated to possess improved stability and oral bioavailability.\n\nNumerous polymerase inhibitors including nucleoside analogs and prodrug variants have been approved as antiviral agents against an array of viruses, including hepatitis C virus (HCV) [68] [69] [70] and HIV and HBV viruses [71] . The mechanism of action of nucleoside analogs involves conversion of the inactive nucleosides into their phosphate or diphosphate forms, which are the actual inhibitory species. Consequently, the norovirus RdRp is an attractive target that is well-suited to the development of norovirus-specific therapeutics due to (a) the vital role RdRp plays in the norovirus replication cycle, (b) the availability of high resolution X-ray crystal structures of free and ligand-bound enzyme complexes [72] [73] [74] [75] and (c) the absence of a human homolog which diminishes the likelihood of off-target effects. Several novel nucleoside inhibitors have been shown to inhibit norovirus via the inhibition of RdRp (Figure 4 ) [76] [77] . Representative syntheses of these inhibitors and variants are illustrated in Figures 5-7 .\n\nDrug repurposing or repositioning, namely, the strategy of applying established drugs to new indications [78] , has resulted in the identification of nucleosides with significant antinorovirus activity [79] . For instance, the nucleoside analog 2'-C-methylcytidine has been found to completely block the transmission of norovirus, affords protection against norovirus-induced diarrhea and mortality in a mouse model, and may be suitable for use as a prophylactic (Figure 8 ) [80] [81] . Moreover, the pyrazine carboxamide antiviral agent favipiravir (T-705) has been shown to inhibit norovirus replication but the mode of action is not well understood [82] [83] . inhibitor of norovirus RdRp [84] . Collectively, the aforementioned studies strongly suggest that the future armamentarium of anti-norovirus therapeutics is likely to include one or more nucleoside analogs that can be used individually or in combination with protease inhibitors.\n\nThe lower potential for the emergence of resistance associated with the targeting of host factors has provided the impetus for the exploration of host factors as potential therapeutic targets. These include interferons (IFNs) [18, 85] , Hsp90 [86] , deubiquitinase [87] , eIF4F [88] , and cholesterol pathway [89] inhibitors. While most of these studies are at an early stage, rapid advances in norovirus pathobiology are likely to identify additional host factors worthy of further investigation.\n\nSeveral studies describing the inhibition of noroviruses by low molecular weight compounds via unknown mechanisms have been reported. These include cyclic and acyclic sulfamides [90] [91] and structural variants [92] [93] [94] , pyranobenzopyrones [95] , and chromones [96] ( Figure 9 ).\n\nCurrently the only compound that has been evaluated in clinical trials as an anti-norovirus therapeutic is nitazoxanide [97] [98] (Figure 9 ), a broad spectrum antiviral agent for multiple viruses including HCV and influenza virus, which has shown efficacy against norovirus infection but the mechanism is not well understood [99] .\n\nOnly a limited number of compounds capable of inhibiting norovirus have been disclosed thus far in the patent literature. These include peptidyl and macrocyclic transition state inhibitors, as well as transition state mimics, of norovirus 3CL protease; nucleoside or nonnucleoside inhibitors of RNA dependent RNA polymerase, and steroidal derivatives capable of blocking the binding of noroviruses to HBGA receptors. These studies are at a very early stage of development and further preclinical studies need to be carried out before a rigorous assessment of these classes of compounds can be made.\n\nDespite the fact that norovirus infections exact a heavy toll in terms of morbidity and economic burden worldwide, an effective small molecule therapeutic or prophylactic for the control of the disease is not currently available. However, the increasing awareness of noroviruses on public health is likely to accelerate drug discovery efforts in this area. The adverse impact of the lack of a cell culture model for complete human norovirus replication is mitigated by the availability of virus-like particles (with binding assays), norovirus replicon harboring cells, and the MNV in vitro and in vivo model, which have provided excellent tools for drug discovery efforts. Significant advances made in the field in recent years have greatly illuminated our understanding of norovirus biology and pathogenesis, and while many facets of the disease await a better understanding, viral and host factors identified thus far could serve as potential druggable targets [100] . These include viral targets, such as entry blockers, and 3CL pro and RdRp inhibitors. There has been a keen interest in the use of new nucleoside or repurposed nucleoside inhibitors of RdRp inhibitors, as well as 3CL pro inhibitors, with most studies being at the early preclinical stage. High throughput screening of libraries using enzyme assays and the norovirus replicon harboring cell system will likely result in the identification of drug-like hits that are amenable to optimization and further advancement along the development pipeline.\n\nObstacles that impede progress in the field in general, as well as norovirus outbreaks and control in particular, include the lack of a) highly sensitive, specific, and low cost diagnostic tests that can be optimally used for the early detection of norovirus infection [2] , b) effective and safe decontaminating agents; c) an effective vaccine; d) a cell culture model, e) an animal model that recapitulates all (or most) aspects of human norovirus infection and, f) a better understanding of norovirus infection. However, despite these obstacles, great strides have been made in our understanding of norovirus biology and pathobiology which should buttress ongoing research endeavors, ultimately leading to the introduction of a norovirusspecific therapeutic in the clinic. Clearly, the prevalence and impact of norovirus infections warrants development of norovirus-specific drugs.\n\nWith respect to diagnosis, surveillance, and control of norovirus outbreaks, various antiviral compositions have been reported in the patent literature. Linear or branched alkyl 2hydroxycarboxylic acid derivatives and sulfonated surfactants in ethanol or isopropanol which have been shown to inactivate non-enveloped viruses, such as noroviruses [101] . These compositions are suitable for providing rapid antimicrobial activity against noroviruses when used as topical skin applications, in hand sanitizers, and in eradicating norovirus contamination of hard surfaces. Currently used agents such as chlorine bleach, iodine preparations and others provide partial protection against norovirus infection. An anti-norovirus disinfectant composition comprised of a persimmon extract and various additives (an alcohol, vitamin C, and a surfactant) has been disclosed recently [102] [103] . Interestingly, the presence of citric acid results in a synergistic anti-norovirus effect. The medicinal use of the persimmon juice has been known in Chinese and Japanese folk medicine for a long time and its effects may arise from the presence of tannins.\n\nFinally, the level of resources devoted to research aimed at combating noroviruses does not currently reflect the severity and impact of norovirus infections worldwide. This is clearly evident by the near-total absence of any potential drug candidates being currently evaluated in clinical trials or undergoing advanced preclinical evaluation. The unmet need for effective treatments, coupled with continued studies describing the burden of disease in different target populations and highlighting its impact on the public health system will no doubt greatly accelerate research efforts in the area.
