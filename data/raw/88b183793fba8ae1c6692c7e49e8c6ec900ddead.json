{"title": "Cycloartenol triterpenoid saponins from Cimicifuga simplex (Ranunculaceae) and their biological effects", "body": "The genus Cimicifuga in the family Ranunculaceae consists of 25 species distributed throughout East Asia, Europe, and North America [1] . Among them, C. dahurica (Turcz.) Maxim., C. heracleifolia Kom., and C. foetida L. have been listed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, and C. simplex has been listed in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia as the original plants of Cimicifuga rhizome in Japan [2] . Cimicifuga rhizome has long been used in East Asian countries to treat headache, dentalgia, aphtha, swelling and pain in the throat, measles, and prolapse of uterus, along with other crude drugs [3] [4] . The constituents of Cimicifuga plants have been extensively investigated and the principal metabolites are 9,19-cyclolanostane triterpenoid glycosides, phenolic derivatives, sterols, alkaloids, and chromones [5] [6] [7] [8] . Interestingly, among these compound types, the 9,19-cyclolanostane triterpenoid glycosides are considered to be characteristics of the Cimicifuga genus, which possess estrogen-like effects and immunosuppressive activities [9] . Recently, more than 120 cycloartane triterpene glycosides have been isolated from C. simplex [5] . The aim is to review these cycloartane triterpene glycosides from the chemical Cimiacerogenin type cycloartenol triterpenoid saponins from Cimicifuga simplex The 9,19-cyclolanostane triterpenoid glycosides are lanolin alkanol type tetracyclic triterpenoids with a distinctive structure of a 9,19-cyclopropane in the B ring. The side chain possesses a hemiacetal structure and a high level of oxidized functional groups, which react with the D ring into seven groups. There may be a close relationship among the biosynthesis of these seven types, as they all have a high level of oxidation at C-15, C-16, and C-17. Oxygen substituents, such as hydroxy and acetoxy groups, may be located at C-1\u03b1, C-3\u03b2, C-6\u03b1, C-7\u03b2, C-11\u03b2, C-12\u03b2, C-15\u03b1, C-16\u03b2, C-18, and C-25; with double bonds at C-7/C-8 and C-25/C-26; and carbonyls located at C-15, C-16, and C-23. The two hydroxyl oxygens of C-24 and C-25 may also be dehydrated to form a ring in these seven types. Glycosidic groups at C-3\u03b2 of the lanolin alkoxides are mostly xylose, and only a few are glucose and arabinose.\n\nPharmacological studies of cycloartenol triterpenoid saponins on Cimicifuga spp.\n\nEduardo et al. have evaluated the 9,19-cycloartenol triterpenoid saponins from Cimicifuga Rhizome for their immunosuppressive activity in a mouse allogeneic mixed lymphocyte test [28] . Their results showed that these compounds possessed potent immunosuppressive activity with IC 50 1.03 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , 5.56 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , and 9.96 \u00d7 10 \u22125 mol\u00b7L \u22121 . Furthermore, their immunosuppressive activities are similar, independent of the sugar moiety [28] . Moreover, Pan et al have reported that cycloartenol triterpenoid saponins isolated from C. foetida effectively inhibit the proliferation of murine splenocytes induced by concanavalin A, with IC 50 values ranging from 12.7 to 33.3 nmol\u00b7L \u22121 . These results have established that these compounds have good immunosuppressive activity. Thus, they may be excellent candidates for the treatment of immunosuppressive diseases, such as psoriasis, osteoporosis, and myasthenia gravis, as well as some kinds of inflammation [10] . \n\nThe rhizomes of Cimicifuga species are traditionally the plant part used for medicinal purposes. In order to efficiently utilize this plant, Tian et al. extracted the total glycosides, and evaluated its cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells and primary cultured normal mouse hepatocytes using MTT assay [29] . Their results showed that an increase in the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 was implicated in the total glycosidesinduced apoptosis, and this extract inhibited the growth of the implanted mouse H22 tumor in a dose-dependent manner. In view of this, the total glycosides potentially find utility as a new candidate for the treatment of hepatoma. Furthermore, the triterpene glycosides also inhibit breast cancer cells through their apoptotic effects [30] [31] [32] [33] .\n\nIn traditional Chinese medicine, Cimicifuga Rhizome can be used to treat some gynecological diseases, such as prolapse of the uterus, metrorrhagia, and metrostaxis. In Western medicine, it is worth mentioning that the extract of black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa (L.) Nutt., Remifemin \u00ae ), which is rich in 9,19-cyclolanostane triterpenoid glycosides, is available as a natural alternative for the treatment of menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes, anxiety, and depression, and other gynecological complaints. This kind of hormone replacement therapy is a common menopausal treatment for breast cancers due to concerns regarding the potential for breast cell proliferation [34] [35] [36] .\n\nThese triterpenoid glycosides also possess several other biological activities, such as, inhibition of thymidine transport into phythoemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes [37] [38] , anti-osteoporosis and anticomplement activities [39] [40] [41] , detoxification [42] , anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and anti-ulcer effects [43] , antiviral [44] , and hypocholesterolemic effects [45] . Furthermore, this type of triterpenoid may be a candidate for development of new drugs for cardiovascular disorders due to 118 Bugbanoside F [27] 119 Shengmaxinside A [12] 120 7,8-Didehydrocimigenol-3-O-\u03b2-D-galactopyranoside [21] 121 Shengmaxinside B [12] 122 1,10-Epoxide-9,11-didehydrocimigenol-3-O-\u03b2-D-xylopyranoside [23] their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities [4] . It also have been used by Native Americans to treat a variety of ailments, including diarrhea, sore throat, and rheumatism, [46] . Cimicifugoside, isolated from C. simplex, is a novel specific nucleoside transport inhibitor that displays synergistic potentiation of methotrexate cytotoxicity [12] . Thus, cimicifugoside may have some pharmacological effects in immunosuppressive activity. In summary, this type of triterpenoid glycoside from Cimicifuga species possesses several biological activities, which makes them excellent candidates for drug development to treat immunosuppressive diseases, tumors, menopausal syndromes, and other disorders.\n\nThis review discusses the traditional uses, phytochemistry, and biological studies of the cycloartenol triterpenoid saponins isolated from Cimicifuga simplex. Thus, this review would provide useful data for researchers having an interest in exploring or developing new drugs from Cimicifuga simplex. Presently, there is a growing trend that the worldwide focus has been changed from pure Western drugs to traditional Chinese medicine due to the significant pharmacological properties of their bioactive ingredients and their ability to treat various diseases [47] . The main components of Cimicifuga spp. are available in Remifemin \u00ae . The resources of C. simplex are substantial in some provinces in China and Japan [48] . However, the pharmacological study and utilization of C. simplex remain inadequate to recognize the real effects of these pharmacological activities. There are several other biolological activities of cimicifugosides from other Cimicifuga species which have been studied, such as the prevention of metabolic syndromes, and deterioration of cartilage in the knee joint of ovariectomized rats and osteoprotective effects [49] . Further researches should investigate these aspects for C. simplex to expand medicinal applications of the Cimicifuga genus. In conclusion, there is a need for more researches on the cycloartenol triterpenoid saponins from C. simplex, from both chemical and biological perspectives, which can permit determination of the distinctions within the Cimicifuga genus and provide a foundation for further research. C. simplex is a traditional Chinese medicine plant, and this review has attempted to emphasize a new research direction, namely the 9,19cyclolanostane triterpenoid glycosides from C. simplex. Further biological studies will provide valuable insights regarding this ethnomedically important plant."}
