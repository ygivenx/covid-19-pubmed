{"title": "Enteritis", "body": "\u2022 Circovirus causes enteritis in pigeons. \u2022 Ulcerative enteritis is found in quails. \u2022 Necrotizing typhlitis caused by spirochetes leads to severe disease in rheas. \u2022 Herpesvirus causes disease in waterbirds, Amazon parrots, macawas, cockatoos, cockatiels, conures, and budgerigars. \u2022 Enteritis due to adenovirus infection has been reported in turkeys, chickens, and African grey parrots. \u2022 Newcastle disease has been reported in poultry and in wild and companion birds. \u2022 Any species, age, or sex may be affected. Birds younger than 12 months of age may be more susceptible to some forms of enteritis. \n\nCrop feeding may be initiated for birds that are anorectic or severely emaciated.\n\n\u2022 Fenbendazole has been reported to cause immune suppression and septicemia in some birds. \u2022 Levamisole has a narrow margin of safety, use with caution as deaths have been reported.\n\n\u2022 Severe dehydration and/or electrolyte imbalances can occur with prolonged diarrhea. \u2022 Emaciation and severe debilitation can result from chronic enteritis.\n\n\u2022 It is recommended to monitor hydration status and electrolytes of the bird. \u2022 A fecal Gram stain can be performed to monitor response to therapy if bacteria are the causative agents of the enteritis. \u2022 A fecal float and/or direct smear should be rechecked 2 weeks after treating for parasites. Three negative fecals are recommended before treatment is discontinued.\n\n\u2022 Dependent on duration of clinical signs and severity of diarrhea and electrolyte imbalances \u2022 Prognosis is good if cause can be determined and eliminated. \u2022 Septic birds have a poor prognosis.\n\n\u2022 It is recommended to initiate therapy with a broadspectrum antibiotic with bactericidal activity against Gramnegative organisms before a definitive diagnosis is determined.\n\n\u2022 Use of parasitic medications should be based on fecal analysis to discourage parasite resistance.
