{"title": "Rapid and Effective Virucidal Activity of Povidone- Iodine Products Against Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara (MVA) Introduction: Since the first case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)", "body": "Four of the six coronaviruses (CoVs) that have made the transition from mammalian/avian hosts to humans are endemic in the human population, and typically associated with mild, self-limiting respiratory illness [1] . However, the remaining two human CoVs cause severe respiratory syndromes and are associated with considerable mortality [1] . In 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV caused a disease outbreak that claimed nearly 800 lives [2] , and for the second consecutive decade this century, a new human CoV has emerged. The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV was first isolated from a 60-year-old man in Saudi Arabia in June 2012 [3] . Three years later, it has been responsible for the infection of more than 1300 individuals in 26 countries, and more than 480 related deaths [4] .\n\nOf all the cases of MERS-CoV reported to date, three quarters have occurred within the source country of Saudi Arabia (Table 1) [4] . Infection in the index case followed recent travel to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE and Bahrain [5] . An International Health Regulations Emergency Committee has highlighted five main factors contributing to the spread of MERS-CoV in the Republic of Korea [6] .\n\nBriefly, these were (1) a lack of awareness among healthcare workers and the general public; (2) suboptimal infection prevention and control measures in hospitals; (3) crowded emergency rooms and multi-bed hospital rooms; (4) the practice of patients seeking care at multiple hospitals; (5) multiple visitors staying with infected patients in hospital rooms.\n\nOverall, clinical experience with MERS-CoV indicates that its spread within the human population requires close contact; the majority of cases have resulted from human-to-human transmission in healthcare settings [7] . There is good potential for outbreaks to be contained, given suitable levels of awareness and hygiene.\n\nThe latest outbreak in Korea, however, is testament to the cost of neglecting these basic requirements. A recent study by our group demonstrated impressive, rapid virucidal activity of povidone iodine (PVP-I) against the Ebola virus (EBOV) [8] . PVP-I was also effective against the European reference virus (Modified vaccinia virus Ankara; MVA), which was determined to be a suitable surrogate test agent, facilitating the safe testing of the virucidal activity of antiseptic products against hazardous pathogens, including enveloped viruses such as EBOV [8] . PVP-I is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial, used globally in the medical field-including the Middle Eastas a disinfectant for skin, hands and mucosal surfaces as well as for wound treatment and eye applications [9] . \n\nThree PVP-I antiseptic products were tested in this study: 4% PVP-I skin cleanser, 7.5% PVP-I surgical scrub and 1% PVP-I gargle/mouthwash, each with the brand name Betadine, manufactured by Mundipharma (Limburg, Germany). This article does not contain any new studies with human or animal subjects performed by any of the authors.\n\nMethodology for propagation of MVA was as described in [8] . Calculations of viral titer (in cases of no virus or low viral count) were as detailed in [8] . \n\nThe titers of MERS-CoV present in the control samples ranged from 6.00 to 6.50 log 10 TCID 50 / mL under clean and dirty conditions. MERS-CoV viral titers were reduced between 4.30 and 4.97 log 10 TCID 50 /mL after 15 s (Table 2) , which corresponds to a reduction in A practical measure applicable to both of these issues is the implementation of effective hand hygiene practice. Standard hand hygiene includes either washing hands with soap and water or the use of an alcohol-based hand rub [16] . Randomized, controlled trial data are available to support the effectiveness of PVP-I and alcohol hand rubs over plain soap hand wash for hand decontamination, based on post-hygiene colony-forming unit count [17] .\n\nIn the context of virucidal activity, PVP-I has demonstrated superiority over ethanol-based sanitizers in inactivating murine norovirus on a modified finger pad test [18] . In an evaluation of the effectiveness of nine different hand sanitizers against feline calicivirus (a surrogate for norovirus), antiseptics containing 10% PVP-I achieved a greater viral reduction rate than any of the alcohol-based sanitizers, non-alcoholic sanitizers or antimicrobial soaps [19] . PVP-I has demonstrated virucidal activity against a range of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. Perhaps most relevant in the context of the MERS-CoV is the evidence for effective inactivation of the SARS-CoV to below detectable levels within 2 min of exposure [20] .\n\nEffective hand hygiene is crucial in minimizing viral transmission from the contaminated hands of an infected individual, either through direct person-to-person contact, or indirectly via contamination of surfaces. However, respiratory viruses are also subject to airborne (particles B5 lm in size) or droplet ([5 lm) transmission, in which infected material is released by the infected individual breathing, coughing or sneezing [21] . Gargling represents an effective personal hygiene measure against airborne/droplet transmission, as it can reduce the microbe count at the pharynx [22] . Together with hand washing and mask use, it has been proposed that gargling is one of the three major personal hygiene protection measures against common airborne and droplet-transmitted infections [22] . Specialists advise that the criteria for selecting mouthwashes should include effectiveness of the antiseptic agent in killing pathogens [22] . highly cytotoxic in cell culture [27] . "}
