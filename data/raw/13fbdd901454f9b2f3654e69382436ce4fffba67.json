{"title": "7 Colds, Influenza and Performance SOCIO-ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF RESPIRATORY ILLNESSES", "body": "is \"off-peak\" due to an approaching influenza attack; and it CAN wipe out in one instant the safety sense in individuals which has taken years to develop/ This conclusion was based largely on case histories, two of which are summarized below.\n\nThe first report comes from a man on a construction site. The second report comes from a police inspector with many years of experience in road safety. I'm convinced that people who drive on the roads when they've got flu coming on are accident prone.... I investigated an accident between two cars that collided head-on at a dangerous set of crossroads. The accident was caused because one of the drivers sneezed. He explained to me, 'Sorry, officer. I oughtn't to be driving at all. I think I've got flu. I've been sneezing all day but I thought it was just a cold when I went to work this morning.' These case histories are supported by statistics on road accidents. Table 7 .1 shows the number of accidents involving ill drivers. It can be seen that this figure increased dramatically in 195 7, the year of the Asian influenza epidemic.\n\nIt is interesting that Tye's report cites cases where performance was impaired just before the illness started. It is often assumed that when an individual has influenza he or she will retire to bed and the question of impaired efficiency will not arise. However, prior to the onset of the illness, performance efficiency may be reduced and other reports suggest that impaired performance may extend into the period after the symptoms have gone. Grant (1972) states that the evidence for influenzal encephalopathy (drowsiness, confusion and epileptiform events) is well established. He also argues that post-influenzal effects may occur and that these can influence the judgements of highly skilled professional staff. Grant cites eleven case histories to support this view and the general features of these can be illustrated by considering the following case.\n\nThe individual concerned was responsible for calibration of a spectrophotometer before commencing a day's work. ... He had previously been off work for two days with influenza and returned alleging health. ... During the first part of the morning he made eleven attempts ... to correctly prepare the instrument. On six occasions he stated his opinion that all the preparative procedures had been completed, and that the instrument was ready for use. Each time, however, elementary faults were observed. Despite the incorrectness of the last calibration, the individual commenced work, compiling results which were finally discarded by himself three weeks later.\n\nThe outstanding features of these case histories are that individuals who had been ill with influenza but no longer had the primary symptoms frequently made technical errors which went unnoticed. There was firm rejection of advisory comments by colleagues, yet the mistakes could not be attributed to poor motivation or general lack of ability.\n\nOverall, these results suggested that experimental studies of illness and performance should be carried out. The case for these appears stronger for influenza than for colds. Indeed, many individuals would claim that the effects of the common cold are too slight or transitory to be of any practical importance, and people are often chided by colleagues for staying off work with a cold. However, many influenza-like illnesses are produced by viruses similar to those which lead to the common cold. Indeed, the term influenza often refers to the systemic effects (fever, myalgia and malaise) which may \u0391\u03a1. Smith accompany a variety of viral infections, and early experimental studies examined infections such as sandfly fever, which is rare but has certain similarities to influenza. These studies will now be briefly reviewed.\n\nWarm and Alluisi (1967) concluded that 'data concerning the effects of infection on human performance are essentially non-existent'. Since their review studies of the effects of very severe illnesses ( e.g. rabbit fever, a febrile disease characterized by headache, photophobia, nausea, myalgia and depression) on performance have been carried out (Alluisi et al, , 1973 Thurmond et al, 1971 ). In one study, those who became ill showed an average drop in performance of about 25 per cent and after recovery they were still 15 per cent below the level of the control group ). There was some evidence that active tasks such as arithmetic computation showed a greater decrement than passive tasks such as watchkeeping.\n\nThe illnesses studied in the above experiments were very severe and analogous effects rarely occur in everyday life. In contrast to this, colds and influenza are widespread and it is of great importance to know more about their effects on performance. There are few studies of this topic and the reasons for this will be discussed in the next section. In one of the few reports of a controlled experiment on naturally occurring colds, Heazlett and Whaley (1976) tested 120 thirteen-year-olds when they were well. Thirty pupils subsequently developed colds and they were retested during their illness. Thirty healthy controls were then randomly selected and retested. The children carried out three tasks and the results showed that reading comprehension was unimpaired whereas auditory and visual perception were worse when the children had colds. The tasks used in this experiment were crude (auditory perception was measured by four sets of nonsense syllables being pronounced to the subject and the subject repeating them; and visual perception was measured by the subject repeating the sequential lighting pattern of four numbered bulbs in a box). Yet even these tasks were able to pick up some form of decrement in the group of subjects who reported having a cold. Such results clearly require replication and yet there has been little attempt to carry out further research in this area. Reasons for this, and difficulties encountered in this type of study, are discussed in the next section.\n\nOne possible reason for the lack of research is that people feel that they already know about the behavioural effects of such illnesses, and it is, therefore. a waste of time carrying out experiments. Another reason that there has been little research in this area is that it is difficult to study naturally-occurring illnesses. These illnesses are hard to predict and it is unclear whether a virus produced the symptoms, and if so which virus was the infecting agent (there are over two hundred viruses that produce colds). The study of naturally occurring illnesses only enables one to examine the effects of clinical illnesses, and it is often difficult to obtain objective measures of the symptoms. It is also possible that subclinical infections may influence behaviour and these can only be identified using the appropriate virological techniques. Such problems have been overcome by examining the effects of experimentally induced colds and influenza at the MRC Common Cold Unit, Salisbury. Before describing the routine of this Unit it is necessary to discuss briefly the causes of colds and influenza in more detail.\n\nHiggins (1984) characterized a cold as 'an increase in nasal discharge, often accompanied by nasal stuffiness, sore throat, coughing and sneezing, but usually lacking the constitutional symptoms of fever, headache, myalgia and malaise which are features of influenza/ Up to the 1950s only the influenza A and \u0392 viruses had been identified. Subsequently, over two hundred viruses producing upper respiratory tract infections have been identified. The majority of colds are thought to be caused by rhinoviruses (over one hundred different types have now been identified) or coronaviruses. However, about one-third of colds are produced by other viruses, such as parainfluenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus, which cause severe illnesses in children but produce symptoms in adults which are indistinguishable from the common cold. While the agents which produce infection are well documented, it is still unclear exactly how they are transmitted and what lies between infection and the appearance of symptoms. (Chakraverty et al, 1986) and new subtypes are constantly appearing. Certain base changes in its DNA sequence alter the viral-specific proteins that are recognized by. the host immune system, thus changing the viruses' antigenic properties. This means that previously immune populations are once again vulnerable, which gives rise to epidemics. Epidemics occur at infrequent intervals, usually after an absence of several years. However, virological surveillance of the UK by the Public Health Laboratory has shown that over the past thirty years strains of influenza A and \u0392 circulate widely each winter (Chakraverty et al, 1986 ).\n\nVolunteers aged 18-50 years came to the MRC Common Cold Unit* for a ten-day stay, during which they agreed to receive an infecting virus inoculation. The volunteers were housed in groups of one to three and isolated from outside contacts (to minimize the chances of infection with other viruses and to reduce the possibility of cross-infection between volunteers). Prior to coming to the Unit the volunteers sent a self-reported medical history. Anyone with serious medical conditions or taking current medication (e.g. sleeping pills, tranquillizers or anti-depressants) was not allowed to take part in the trial, and neither were pregnant women.\n\nOn the first day of the trial the volunteers were given a medical examination, chest X-ray, and biochemical assays performed on a blood sample. Any volunteers with abnormal results were excluded from the trial. The blood sample was also necessary to enable assessment of the initial antibody levels for the virus they were to be given. Isolation began in the afternoon of the first day and the volunteers were observed during a three-day quarantine period so that any individuals who were incubating a cold could be excluded.\n\nVolunteers were then given either the virus (or on some trials two viruses) or a saline placebo on the fourth day. The trials were conducted double-blind with neither the volunteers, the Unit's clinician, nor any of the staff who interacted with the subjects knowing which volunteers received virus or placebo. About one-third of the volunteers given a virus remained uninfected (i.e. the virus could not be detected in the person's body). This meant that very few subjects were given placebo in order to maximize infection rates (typically two or three volunteers out of thirty were given saline).\n\nThe most frequently used viruses were rhinoviruses types 2, 9 and 14, Coronavirus type 229E, and respiratory syncytial virus. A few studies involved challenge with influenza A or influenza \u0392 viruses. Starting two days before virus challenge and continuing six days after challenge, each volunteer was examined daily by the Unit's clinician and any signs/symptoms of respiratory illness recorded using a standard protocol (see Beare and Reed, 1977) . Examples of items on the protocol include sneezing, watering of the eyes, nasal stuffiness, nasal obstruction, sinus pain, sore throat, hoarseness, cough and fever. Objective measures of illness were taken, the most important in the case of colds being the number of tissues used daily and the weight of nasal secretion. Sublingual temperatures were also recorded in the early morning and evening. * All procedures of the Common Cold Unit were approved by the Harrow District Ethical Committee and carried out with the consent of the volunteers.\n\nThe following assays were carried out to isolate viruses and identify changes in viral-specific antibody levels. The nasal wash samples were mixed with broth and stored in aliquots at -70\u00b0C. Rhinoviruses were detected in O-Hela cells, respiratory syncytial virus in Hep2 cells and Coronavirus in C-16 strain of human fibroblast cells. When a characteristic cytopathic effect was observed the tissue culture fluids were passaged into further cultures and identity tests on the virus performed. Rhinoviruses and coronaviruses were confirmed by neutralization tests (with specific rabbit immune serum) and respiratory syncytial virus by immunofluorescent staining of culture cells. Levels of neutralizing antibodies (rhinoviruses only) and of specific antiviral Ig A and IgG (all viruses) were determined from the initial blood sample and one returned to the Unit twenty-eight days after challenge. A fourfold rise in neutralizing antibodies was regarded as significant evidence of infection. An IgG or IgA increase of two standard deviations greater than the mean of non-challenged volunteers was also taken as a measure of infection.\n\nApproximately two-thirds of the volunteers became infected with the virus. About half of these infected volunteers developed a significant cold approximately 24-96 hours after challenge (depending on the type of virus). The significance of a cold was based on the clinician's judgement (using data from the symptom/sign protocol). At the end of the trial the clinician judged the severity of each volunteer's cold on a scale ranging from nil (0) to severe (4). Ratings of a mild cold (2) or greater were considered positive clinical diagnoses. Volunteers also judged the severity of their colds on the same scale, and clinical diagnosis and self-diagnosis agreed about 90 per cent of the time.\n\nThe clinical trials at the Common Cold Unit were designed for purposes other than examining the effects of respiratory virus infections on performance. This imposed certain limitations on the type of task and length and frequency of testing. Similarly, portable tests had to be used because the volunteers were in isolation and could only be tested in their flats. As already mentioned, there is little information on the effects of naturally occurring illnesses on performance. It was decided, therefore, initially to examine the effects of a variety of different viruses on many different aspects of performance, the aim being to draw up a profile of the effects of the different illnesses. Following this 'broad-band strategy' (see Hockey and Hamilton, 1983) it was envisaged that a hypothesis-driven approach with more focused test selection would be adopted. Unfortunately, the closure of the Unit meant that this second stage was not completed. However, the initial studies greatly increased our knowledge of the effects of colds and influenza on performance and the methods used are described below.\n\nTwo main methods of performance testing were used. The first involved administration of paper and pencil tests measuring logical reasoning, visual search and semantic processing. Subjects also rated their mood and performed a simple motor task involving the transfer of pegs from a full solitaire set to an empty one. These tests were carried out at four times of day (8.00 a.m., 12 noon, 5.00 p.m. and 10 p.m.) on every day of the trial. It was important to examine performance at several times of day for two reasons. Firstly, it has been shown that performance changes over the day and, secondly, there is diurnal variation in the severity of symptoms of colds and influenza (see Smith et al, 1988a) with nasal secretion and temperature being highest in the early morning. This first method of assessing performance was used only in a small number of trials, largely because it was unpopular with the volunteers and because it interfered with the routine of the Unit.\n\nThe second method of assessing performance used computerized performance tasks, with volunteers being tested once in the pre-challenge quarantine period (the baseline measurement) and again when symptoms were apparent in some volunteers. In a few trials, performance testing was also carried out in the incubation period, and in one trial performance was assessed after the symptoms had gone. Subjects were always tested at the same time of day on all occasions (although some subjects were tested in the morning and others in the afternoon, which meant that a between-subjects comparison allowed diurnal variation of any effects to be measured). The computerized tasks were selected to assess a range of functions (memory, attention, motor skills) and most of the tests have been widely used to study abnormal states or stressful environments. In most trials the volunteers could be subdivided into those with colds, those with subclinical infections and those who remained uninfected (or were given placebos). In some trials, however, there were no volunteers in certain categories. Analyses of covariance were carried out on the data using the pre-challenge scores as covariates. This statistical technique takes account of baseline differences when assessing the effects of the illness.\n\nThe following section describes the effects of influenza on performance.\n\nSmith et al (1987a) examined the effects of influenza illnesses on three tasks. Two of the tasks required subjects to detect and respond quickly to targets appearing at irregular intervals (a variable fore-period simple reaction time task and a '5s' detection task where subjects were shown single digits and had to respond as quickly as possible when they saw a 5 ). The other was a pursuit tracking task designed to test hand-eye co-ordination.\n\nInfluenza \u0392 increased reaction times in both detection tasks (results are shown in Figure 7.1) . Analysis of the tracking task showed no significant difference between those with influenza and those who remained healthy.\n\nIt should be pointed out that the effects of influenza on the simple reaction time task were very large (a 57 per cent impairment). This can be illustrated by comparing the magnitude of the effect with that produced by a moderate dose of alcohol or by having to perform at night. In both of these latter cases the impairment is typically in the range of 5-10 per cent. \n\nwere not impaired on the pegboard task. These results are shown in Figure 7 .2.\n\nThe study also showed that influenza did not impair the speed or accuracy of logical reasoning. However, it did show that even subclinical infections can impair performance (see Figure 7. 2) and it also demonstrated that effects may be apparent in the incubation period prior to the onset of symptoms. This last effect is shown in Figure 7. 3. Figure 7 .4.\n\nThe error data also confirmed that influenza impaired search tasks but not those involving focused attention. Unfortunately, no further influenza trials were carried out at the Common Cold Unit. An attempt was, however, made to examine the mechanisms underlying the effects of influenza on performance and this study is described below.\n\nIn influenza, interferon \u03b1 can be found in the circulation and it is now clear that such peptide mediators have an effect on the CNS. It was, therefore, postulated that the performance deficits observed in influenza may be due to interferon or some similar molecule. This was tested by injecting volunteers with different doses of interferon \u03b1 and it was predicted that those who attention tasks. received a dose which produced the symptoms of influenza would show comparable performance impairments. The results of this study are described in detail in Smith et al (1988c) and Smith et al (1991a) . The data from the simple reaction time task showed that an injection of 1.5 Mu produced an identical change to that seen in subjects with influenza. This is shown in Figure 7 .5.\n\nHowever, there were two problems with the interferon-influenza hypothesis. Firstly, the search and memory task was not impaired by IFN, whereas influenza \u0392 infections led to slower performance of this task. Secondly, performance on the pegboard task was impaired by interferon, and yet this has not been found in studies of influenza. These discrepant results could reflect differences between virally-induced interferon production and direct challenge, or it could be that other peptide mediators (e.g. interleukin 1) are also responsible for the influenza effects. While it is clear, therefore, that the interferon explanation of the effects of influenza is too simplistic, the results of the study show that cytokines do produce CNS effects and that further research is now needed to map out in detail which effects reflect the actions of given peptide mediators.\n\nThese preliminary studies of the effects of experimentally induced influenza infections and illnesses confirm the view that influenza may impair performance efficiency. The effects appear to be selective with tasks requiring response to targets presented at uncertain times or in unknown locations being most impaired. The absence of more global effects may reflect the small numbers of subjects tested (i.e. the methodology picked up only the biggest effects) and this must now be examined by studying naturally occurring influenza.\n\nThe results do confirm some other points raised by the case histories reported earlier in the chapter. For example, they show that a person does not have to be symptomatic to be impaired, for those with subclinical infections and volunteers incubating illnesses were also impaired. Such results have been obtained in studies of other illnesses (see Elsass and Henriksen, 1984) and they raise the interesting possibility that performance changes may be used as indicators of subsequent illness.\n\nThe studies of experimentally induced influenza are also important for the area of psychoneuroimmunology, in that they show that a virally-induced immune response influences the brain and behaviour. Initially, we believed that the mediator involved was interferon a, but this alone cannot account for all of the performance effects of influenza. Further studies must, therefore, determine whether the results we obtained at the Common Cold Unit generalize to naturally occurring illnesses, and they must also assess the functional significance of such effects. At the same time, we must continue to study the mechanisms by which influenza affects the CNS, as these are likely to be common to many other viral infections.\n\nThe next section reviews studies of the effects of experimentally-induced colds on performance. Figure 7 .6, and it can be seen that they are very different from those found with influenza.\n\nSubjects with colds were not impaired on the two detection tasks but they were worse at the tracking task than those who remained well. Separate analyses of the rhinovirus and Coronavirus groups showed similar effects, although the impairment on the tracking task was greater in those with rhinovirus colds. The rhinovirus group had greater nasal secretion than those challenged with the Coronavirus, and this suggested that there may be a direct link between the severity of the symptoms and the performance decrement. However, when correlations were calculated between objective measures of illness and performance (for subjects with significant colds only) no significant relationship was obtained.\n\nSmith et al (1988b) compared the effects of influenza with colds following challenge with respiratory syncytial virus. Again, the volunteers with colds showed a different pattern of impairment to those with influenza, and in the case of colds it was performance of the pegboard task which was impaired, not the search and memory task. This is shown in Figure 7 .7.\n\nVolunteers with colds also differed from those with influenza in that no impairments were observed during the incubation period and neither did volunteers with subclinical infections show significant changes. However, results from another study (Smith et al, 1987b ) did show that both those with colds and those with subclinical infections were slower than uninfected subjects on another task (the five-choice serial reaction time task) involving hand-eye co-ordination. These results are shown in Figure 7 the moment it is unclear why such after-effects occur. One possibility is that the performance tests are sensitive to the immunological changes that occur after symptoms have gone. Another possibility is that subjects continue to perform at a lower level because they 'learnt' the task when they were ill. Further experiments are required to resolve this issue.\n\nThese initial studies showed that experimentally-induced colds impair tasks involving hand-eye co-ordination but have little effect on detection tasks. It is unclear which mechanisms underlie these effects. There is considerable evidence that certain types of virus (e.g. enteroviruses) have a strong affinity for muscle and may produce muscle damage. Recent evidence (Mier-Jedrzejowicz et al, 1988) confirms that upper respiratory tract infections can influence muscle function and this provides a plausible explanation for some of the effects on performance. Another possibility is that some other cytokine (e.g. interleukin 2) is involved. Indeed, it is well known that these mediators have an effect on the muscles which could account for the impaired hand-eye co-ordination. Alternatively, the impairments could be due to changes in sensory stimulation via the trigeminal nerves in the nose. Lastly, they could represent a 'distraction effect', produced by sneezing or other nasal irritations. The main difficulty for all these possible explanations is in accounting for why the effects are selective (observed in some tasks but not others). These selective effects were examined in further detail by considering the effects of colds on a range of memory tasks and also different aspects of vision. The following sections summarize these two topics.\n\nNo colds (Smith et al, 1990a) . Many aspects of memory, such as the ability to recall a string of digits in order, or to recall a list of words, appeared to be unaffected by having a cold. Similarly, there was little evidence that colds impair retrieval of information from semantic memory. However, having a cold did produce difficulties in learning and recall of more complex material such as the information presented in a story. Here the effect was not that recall was Key \u2022 Pre-challenge 0 Symptoms\n\n\u2022 No symptoms reduced but rather that people with a cold had more difficulty following the theme of a story and instead focused on detail which was less relevant to the overall theme. In contrast to this, colds did not impair retrieval of material learnt before the cold. Indeed, there was some evidence that reminiscence, the ability to recall information which was not retrievable immediately after learning, was better when the person had a cold. This may reflect the decreased arousal produced by the cold. Figure 7 .10 than did those who were uninfected or who had colds. This effect was not replicated when volunteers were challenged with either a Coronavirus or rhinovirus. However, contrast sensitivity improved in volunteers with a subclinical Coronavirus infection. These studies were also important in that they showed that pre-challenge measures can be used to indicate susceptibility to infection and illness. These effects are reviewed in the following section. There has been considerable interest in investigating whether psychological factors are important in determining susceptibility to infection and illness. Studies carried out at the Common Cold Unit (e.g. Totman et al, 1980; Broadbent et al, 1984; Cohen et al, 1991) have shown that factors such as personality and stress influence vulnerability to infection. Smith et al (1990b) showed that performance measures taken prior to virus challenge may also be related to the likelihood of developing a cold. In other words, volunteers who get a cold may be worse than those who remain uninfected even before they are given the virus. Smith et al (in press) found that volunteers who developed colds following respiratory syncytial virus challenge were more sensitive to a visually disturbing pattern prior to challenge than individuals who remained symptom-free. This effect could not be attributed to different stress levels or personality characteristics of the two groups of subjects.\n\nMany trials at the Common Cold Unit were designed to assess the efficacy of prophylactic and therapeutic drugs. It was possible to determine not only the clinical efficacy of the drugs but to examine whether they removed the performance impairments associated with a cold. One study demonstrated that sodium nedocromil (a drug thought to suppress mediators such as histamine) reduced cold symptoms and the extent of the cold-induced performance decrement (Barrow et al, 1990) . Similarly, Smith et al (1991b) showed that sucking zinc gluconate lozenges can eliminate the slower reaction times associated with having a cold. Unfortunately, the mode of action of these drugs is unclear, and they provide little information about the mechanisms underlying the effects of colds on performance.\n\nThe research carried out at the Common Cold Unit showed that upper respiratory virus infections and illnesses can reduce performance efficiency. The effects were selective in that they depended on the nature of the activity being carried out and the type of virus. The impairments were not restricted to times when the person was symptomatic but also occurred before and after the illness. Subclinical infections also reduced performance, although again the effect was selective. The research also showed that performance measures taken before virus challenge were related to susceptibility of developing a cold. Unfortunately, we have little knowledge of the mechanisms underlying these effects, although it does appear that peptide mediators may be involved. It must now be asked what implications these studies have for safety and efficiency.\n\nThe major achievement of the Common Cold Unit research was that it provided a basis for future research on the effects of upper respiratory viral illnesses. Indeed, the results show that such a study is now warranted, although one should bear in mind that it would be a mistake to assume that analogous effects will necessarily be observed with real-life illnesses and tasks. Naturally occurring illnesses are typically more severe than those examined at the Common Cold Unit and one could argue that they should produce far greater effects. However, many real-life tasks are well practised and one could suggest that this will make them less susceptible to the effects of these illnesses. One should also note that many other factors influence performance efficiency and it would be wrong to continue to study the effects of these illnesses in isolation. Indeed, it is possible that viral illnesses not only have direct effects on performance but may indirectly influence it by making the person more susceptible to other factors.\n\nOne great advantage of the Common Cold Unit studies has been that they have shown which methodological features are essential. The selective effects of different viruses means that one must use virological techniques to attempt to discover which virus was responsible for the illness. This is difficult to do at the moment and only about 30 per cent of samples yield a positive viral identification, which means large numbers of subjects must be tested to obtain enough subjects in each virus condition. Ideally, one also wants to carry out prospective studies with pre-illness baselines for subjects. This technique is much more sensitive than cross-sectional methodologies. One also wants to use tasks which are not susceptible to the effects of compensatory effort, which can reduce the apparent effect of other low arousal states such as sleep-deprivation. In other words, research on the functional significance of upper respiratory illnesses will have both problems which are specific to the topic and those which are common to the study of other possible influences on performance. Nevertheless, the anecdotal case histories and"}
