Agents in the infectious state I are infected 73 and infective, while those in the recovered state R are immune to and do not transmit disease. 74 The transition between states is captured with the state-transition diagram shown in Fig. 1 . For 75 reference, all the parameters and variables in the SPIR model are listed and defined in Table 1 . S, P, I, and R represent the four epidemiological states an agent can be in: Susceptible, Prophylactic, Infectious, and Recovered, respectively. The parameters over the transitions connecting the states represent the probability per time step that agents in one state move to an adjacent state: i is the proportion of infectious agents in the population; bS and bP are the respective probabilities that an agent in state S or P, encountering an infectious agent I, becomes infected; g is the recovery probability; d is the behavioral decision making probability; and W(i) is an indicator function returning value 1 when the utility of being prophylactic is greater than the utility of being susceptible and 0 otherwise (see details in Behavioral Decision Model). This sub-model assumes that in each time step, three types of events occur: (i) interactions Proportion of susceptible agents in the population. p\n\nProportion of prophylactic agents in the population. i\n\nProportion of infectious agents in the population. r\n\nProportion of recovered agents in the population. b S Probability that an agent in the susceptible state becomes infected upon interacting with an infectious agent. b P Probability that an agent in the prophylactic state becomes infected upon interacting with an infectious agent. \u03c1\n\nReduction in the transmission probability or rate when adopting prophylactic behavior: b P = \u03c1b S (0 \u2264 \u03c1 \u2264 1).

This is because they assume a constant i 158 which implies the best strategy now will remain the best strategy at all times during H. \n\nDistorting knowledge of i. Recall that assumption (iii) that underlies the behavioral decision 165 model is that agents know the prevalence of the disease accurately. We relax this assumption to 166 investigate how distorting this information effects the SPIR model. To achieve this, we replace i 167 with i 1 /\u03ba in the calculation of utilities where \u03ba serves as a distortion factor. When \u03ba = 1, i is not 168 distorted; when \u03ba > 1, the agent perceives i to be above its real value and when \u03ba < 1 the 169 opposite is true. To implement this distortion, we simply redefine f X in the expected waiting 170 time equations (i.e. Eqs. (3)- (7)) with f X = i 1 /\u03ba b S when X = S and f X = i 1 /\u03ba \u03c1b S when X = P. 171\n\nThe SPIR model is suitable for helping understand the influence of human behavior for diverse 173 infectious disease epidemics. To illustrate specific characteristics of the model, however, we 174 focus here on two contrasting diseases characterized by their severity, recovery time, and harm: 175\n\nDisease 1 is acute, has a long recovery time, and may cause chronic harm, and Disease 2 is mild, 176\n\n.

When the proportion of infectious agents is between these switch points, agents adopt 209\n\nprophylactic behavior, while values outside this range drives agents to adopt non-prophylactic 210 behavior. This situation is of particular interest because it shows that the adoption of 211 prophylactic behavior is not always monotonically associated with the prevalence of the disease. 212\n\nThe utility calculations that agents use to decide whether to adopt a behavior are complex 213 (see Eqs. (9) and (10)); an exhaustive exploration of the parameter space is not undertaken here. 214 We instead investigate several paradigm cases related to the payoff ordering. We assume that the 215 payoff for the infectious state (u I ) relies upon biological parameters of the disease and always 216 corresponds to the lowest payoff, thus we need only consider the relationship between the other 217 three payoffs. In particular, we are interested in looking at situations where the recovery payoff 218 ranges from complete recovery (case 1) to less than the prophylactic state (case 4). Figure 4 . Heat maps of switch points for payoffs ordering cases of Disease 1 and Disease 2.\n\nIn (A) and (E) the payoff of being susceptible and recovered are equal, which means that agents recover completely from the disease after infection. In (B) and (F), the recovered payoff is lower than the susceptible payoff, but still greater than the prophylactic payoff meaning that it is more advantageous being recovered than in the prophylactic state. In (C) and (G), any advantage comparison between being in the prophylactic or recovered state is eliminated. In (D) and (G), the disease debilitates the agent meaning that they would be better off engaging in prophylactic behavior rather be in the prophylactic state than the recovered state. The heat maps of behavioral change assume payoffs {u S , u P , u I , u R } of ( \n\nThe effects of progressively reducing the recovered payoff are more evident for Disease 2.\n\nReducing the recovered payoff means that lower levels of prevalence will be sufficient for agents 236 to change their behavior. In the case of equal value for recovered and susceptible payoffs, agents 237 consider changing behavior only in narrow parameter range of protection efficacy and planning 238 horizon values (Fig. 4E) . Progressively reducing the recovered payoff, i.e. moving from case 1 239 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Mathematically, switch points occur where the utility 246 functions for S and P are equal (Eqs. (9) and (10)). Replacing the expected time notation 247 E T Y|DX in the utility U S and U P by the more concise T Y|X , where X \u2208 {S, P} and 248 Y \u2208 {S, P, I, R}, we have\n\nLet K 1 = uS\u2212uR uI\u2212uR , which weights the benefits of S and I, and K 2 = uP\u2212uR uS\u2212uR , which weights the 251 benefit of S and P. Then,\n\nBecause the payoff ordering u S > u R > u P > u I and noting that T I|S \u2265 T I|P and K \u22121 1 = uI\u2212uR uS\u2212uR , 253 we have that K \u22121 1 T I|S \u2212 T I|P \u2264 0 and 0 < K 2 < 1. From these we analyze some general 254 cases. 255 First, we analyze the case in which K 2 T P|P \u2212 T S|S \u2265 0, then K 2 T P|P \u2265 T S|S .

Figure 7A shows the proportion of infectious agents above which the prophylactic behavior 328 is more advantageous than non-prophylactic behavior assuming agents know the real disease 329 prevalence (\u03ba = 1). By distorting the perceived disease prevalence to increase the risk 330 perception of being infected (\u03ba = 1.5), the real proportion of infectious agents necessary for 331 agents to engage in prophylactic behavior is reduced as shown in Fig. 7B . Hence, the distortion 332 on disease prevalence makes agents engage in prophylactic behavior even when the chance of 333 being infected is low. This affects the epidemic dynamics by reducing the peak size but Proportion of infectious agents above which the prophylactic behavior is more advantageous than the non-prophylactic behavior considering the percentage of protection obtained for adopting the prophylactic behavior (1 \u2212 \u03c1) \u00d7 100 and the planning horizon H.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/069013 doi: bioRxiv preprint Individuals acting in their own self-interest make behavioral decisions to reduce their likelihood 337 of getting infected in response to an epidemic. We explore a decision making process that 338 integrates the prophylaxis efficacy and the current disease prevalence with individuals' payoffs 339 and planning horizon to understand the conditions in which individuals adopt prophylactic 340 behavior.\n\nOur results show that the adoption of prophylactic behavior is sensitive to a planning horizon. 342\n\nIndividuals with a short planning horizon (i.e. \"live for the moment\") do not engage in 343 prophylactic behavior because of its adoption costs. Individuals with a long planning horizon 344 also fail to adopt prophylactic behavior, but for different reasons. They prefer to \"get it over Moreover, the agents take into consideration only the payoffs of being susceptible and recovered 356 when optimizing the contact rates. In the SPIR model, however, agents maintain a constant 357 contact rate, yet adopt prophylactic behavior that reduces the chance of getting infected. When 358 agents are deciding to engage in prophylactic behavior, they take into account the payoff of all 359 possible epidemiological states. The fact that we reach the same conclusion using different 360 models further supports the claim that the planning horizon is a relevant decision making factor 361 in understanding epidemic dynamics.\n\nAlthough associated with the prevalence of disease, the adoption of prophylactic behavior is 363 not always monotonically associated with it. Its adoption depends on the behavioral decision The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/069013 doi: bioRxiv preprint severe diseases with shorter recovery time, e.g. Disease 2 (Fig. 4E-H) . Therefore, understanding 367 the payoffs related to each disease is critical to proposing effective public policies, especially 368 because there is not a \"one-size-fits-all\" solution.\n\nAnother aspect to highlight is that the beneficial adoption of prophylactic behavior can be 370 achieved through two different public policies: change the risk perception or introduce 371 incentives that reduce the difference between the susceptible and prophylactic payoffs. The 372 problem with increasing the risk perception is that if it is overdone, it leads to the opposite result 373 to the one that is desired. Because individuals perceive their risk of getting the disease as highly 374 probable, they prefer to \"get it over with\" and enjoy the benefits of being recovered. In contrast, 375 the more the prophylaxis is incentivized the better the results, e.g. reduction of epidemic peak 376 size.\n\nSimilar to our SPIR model, Perra et al. [15] and Del Valle et al. [4] also proposed an 378 extension to the SIR model and included a new compartment that reduces the transmission rate 379 between the susceptible and infectious states. A clear distinction between these models and the 380 SPIR model is that their agents do not take into account the costs associated with moving 381 between the susceptible compartment and this new compartment. While in Perra et al. [15] 382 agents make the decision to move between compartments based on the disease prevalence, in 383 Del Valle et al. [4] new constant transfer rates are defined to handle the transition.\n\nIn addition to these differences, an advantage of the SPIR model with respect to all other 385 models that implement some behavioral change is the distinction between the disease dynamics 386 and behavioral models. This distinction renders the model flexible by making it easier to, e.g. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.
