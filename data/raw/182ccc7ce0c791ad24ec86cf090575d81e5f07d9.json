{"title": "Basic Mechanisms and Therapy", "body": "Mouse hepatitis viruses (MHV) are a group of hepatoencephalitic coronaviruses, of the Nidovirales order, which are common natural pathogens in mice (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Lavi and Weiss, 1989) . MHV-A59 is a neurotropic virus that causes a biphasic disease in susceptible mice. Acute disease consists of severe hepatitis and focal meningoencephalitis, whereas chronic disease consists of demyelinating lesions, found mainly in the spinal cord (Lavi et al, 1984b) . The resemblance to multiple sclerosis (MS) makes it an attractive experimental model for MS (Lavi et al, 1984a; Lavi et al, 1999) . MHV-2, on the other hand, causes a monophasic disease, consisting of acute hepatitis and meningitis (Das Sarma et al, 2001b) . Penn98-1 is a recombinant virus produced with the backbone of MHV-A59 and an S gene derived from MHV-2. It causes acute hepatitis and meningoencephaliti s but does not cause demyelination (Das Sarma et al, 2000) . The phenotypic difference between these three closely related viruses provides an opportunity to study the contribution of various phenotypic properties to pathogenesis.\n\nApoptosis has been reported following various viral infections (Razvi and Welsh, 1995) . Apoptosis induces elimination of virus-infected cells by cytotoxic T cells (Shibata et al, 1994) ; it slows viral spread (Clem et al, 1991) , or participates in an autoimmune process (Osborne, 1996) . Sindbis virus infection causes apoptosis during fatal encephalomyelitis in neonatal mice, whereas infection of adult mouse brain results in insigni cant cytopathology and only minimal apoptosis (Grif n et al, 1994a (Grif n et al, , 1994b . Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection is associated with abundant apoptosis in neurons and in mononuclear cells in the brain and spinal cord during acute infection. During the chronic demyelinating disease induced by the virus, apoptotic oligodendrocytes , macrophages, microglia, and astrocytes are found in demyelinating lesions (Palma et al, 1999; Tsunoda et al, 1997) . In experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), the disease is much milder in mice lacking Fas and Fas ligand molecules, with equal in ammatory response, suggesting that apoptosis contributes to the clinical disease and demyelination (Okuda et al, 1998; Sabelko et al, 1997; Waldner et al, 1997) . A pan-caspase inhibitor, injected prior to immunization, signi cantly reduces the incidence of EAE. Treated animals show less in ammatory in ltrates and demyelination, and reduced axonal loss (Furlan et al, 1999) . However, though molecules of the apoptotic cascade are well represented in the central nervous system (CNS) during the disease process in EAE, their expression is mainly in in ammatory cells and microglia but not in oligodendrocytes .\n\nThe role of apoptosis in MHV-induced disease is still under debate. Two studies show apoptotic T cells, macrophages, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in MHV-(JHM) infection (Barac-Latas et al, 1997; Wu and Perlman, 1999) , but neither one of these studies compared demyelinating viruses with nondemyelinating viruses, and therefore were unable to directly address the relevance of apoptosis to demyelination. In one of these reports, the authors interpreted the nding as indicating that the distribution of demyelination correlates with macrophage in ltration better than with the presence of apoptotic cells (Wu and Perlman, 1999) . This study did not investigate the nature of the apoptotic cells by cell-speci c markers and therefore could not identify parenchymal cell apoptosis. In another study, Fas-de cient mice infected with JHM virus variant J2.2-v1 did not show a different level of demyelination and in ammation from wild-type infected mice (Parra et al, 2000) . However, apoptosis can occur by a Fas-independent mechanism. In the present study we re-examined the potential role of apoptosis in MHV-induced disease using a variety of MHV strains with different biologic properties. We used a demyelinating strain of the virus (MHV-A59) in comparison to a nondemyelinating, strain (MHV-2), which we recently sequenced and characterize d (Das Sarma et al, 2001b) , and two newly constructed recombinant viruses (Penn98-1 and Penn98-2) that present a hybrid phenotype (Das Sarma et al, 2000) . The availability of these closely related viruses that differ in the demyelination phenotype helps to better de ne the role of apoptosis in demyelination.\n\nTdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining was detected in the brains and livers of mice infected with MHV-A59, Penn98-1, and MHV-2. Extensive apoptosis was found in the liver in all types of infections, and was strictly associated with areas of necrosis and in ammation, representing hepatitis. The difference in the distribution pattern of apoptosis correlated with the difference in the extent of hepatitis present in these three viral infections. MHV-A59 infection caused distinctive foci of hepatitis and apoptosis ( Figure 1A ), whereas MHV-2 and Penn98-1 caused an extensively disseminated pattern (Navas et al, 2001) . TUNEL-positive nuclei were detected as early as 1 day post infection with MHV-2, whereas apoptotic cells in MHV-A59 infection were detected only after 3 days post infection. Apoptotic staining peaked at 5 to 7 days post infection but was no longer detectable 11 days post infection ( Figure 2A ). Rare cells, identi ed morphologically as hepatocytes, exhibited double staining with TUNEL and MHV antigen ( Figure 1F ). The distribution of TUNEL-positive cells in the liver was similar to the distribution of MHV-infected cells. The disseminated pattern induced by MHV-2 and Penn98-1 in the liver correlated with antigen distribution.\n\nApoptosis in the meninges was found in mice infected with MHV-A59, Penn98-1, or MHV-2. TUNEL-positive cells were detected from 1 day post infection in MHV-2-infected mice and 3 days post infection in MHV-A59-infected mice, and were observed until 8 days post infection. Positive cells were more abundant in MHV-2-infected mice (level 3) ( Figure 1E ), compared with MHV-A59-infected mice (level 2). Labeling was also seen in some ependymal and subependymal cells.\n\nBrain parenchymal apoptosis correlated with the degree of encephalitis and was found mainly in A demyelinating lesion is seen at the anterior column of the cord's white matter, shown here as less intense brown staining. Note positive TUNEL signal at the periphery of the demyelinating lesion, but very little in other parts of the white matter (100\u00a3). (E) TUNEL staining of a mouse brain section 5 days after IC infection with MHV-2. Note positive TUNEL signal restricted to the meninges, and occasional subpial cells (100\u00a3). (F) Liver section from a mouse 5 days following IC infection with MHV-A59. TUNEL staining (black) combined with immunohistochemistry, was applied using anti-MHV rabbit polyclonal antibodies (red). Note viral antigen in TUNEL-positive hepatocytes (400\u00a3). (G) Spinal cord section from a mouse 30 days after IC infection with MHV-A59. TUNEL staining (black) was combined with immunohistochemistry (red) using anti-GFAP antibodies. Next to a demyelinating area, note two GFAP-positive cells (astrocytes) also expressing TUNEL staining (400\u00a3). (H) Spinal cord section from a mouse 30 days after IC infection with MHV-A59. TUNEL staining (blue) was combined with immunohistochemistry (red) using anti-CAII antibodies. Close to a demyelinating area note at the center a CAII-positive cell (oligodendrocyte) also expressing TUNEL staining next to a CAIIpositive, TUNEL-negative oligodendrocyte. Another TUNEL-positive oligodendrocyte is also present (400\u00a3). (I) Spinal cord section from a mouse 30 days after IC infection with MHV-A59. TUNEL staining (black) was combined with immunohistochemistry (red) using F4/80 antibodies. Next to a demyelinating lesion note an F4/80-positive cell (macrophage/microglia) also expressing TUNEL staining (400\u00a3).\n\nMHV-A59-and, to a lesser extent, in Penn98-1infected mice. There was no brain parenchymal TUNEL staining, and no encephalitis, in MHV-2infected brains. The distribution of TUNEL-positive cells in MHV-A59-infected mice was predominantly in the olfactory bulb, basal forbrain, subiculum, entorhinal cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, and corpus callosum ( Figure 1B, C) . The distribution correlated with the distribution of pathology and viral antigen as previously described (Lavi et al, 1988) . Only rare cells expressed both viral antigen and TUNEL labeling in the brain of MHV-A59-and Penn98-1-infected mice, and rare cells expressed both TUNEL and viral antigen in the meninges of MHV-2-infected mice. The vast majority of the TUNEL-positive cells were antigen negative and many antigen-positive cells were TUNEL negative. Apoptosis was noticed from day 3 post infection, peaked on day 5 (level 3), and was no longer detectable on day 11 ( Figure 2B ). In all the kinetics studies of apoptosis, there was only minimal differences between mice of the same time point. Mock-infected mice with L2 lysate had negative TUNEL staining in all tissues.\n\nThe presence ofapoptosis in the olfactory bulb was also investigated by electron microscopy and compared with TUNEL staining. Following intranasal infection, the olfactory bulbs had the highest concentration of TUNEL-positive cells at 5 days post infection. Electron microscopy (EM) analysis of the olfactory bulb of two MHV-A59-infected mice revealed numerous neurons showing condensation of nuclei and fragmentatio n of the chromatin, characteristic of apoptosis, whereas the olfactory bulb of a mock-infected control mouse showed normal morphology without any evidence of apoptosis ( Figure 3 ).\n\nChronic stage-apoptosis was found in areas of demyelination TUNEL staining was observed in the spinal cords obtained 30 days post infection exclusively in demyelination-positiv e mice (infected with 5 or 25 PFU of MHV-A59). Seven out of 10 mice infected with 5 PFU A59 and 8 of 8 mice infected with 25 PFU A59 developed demyelination. All 15 demyelination-positiv e mice were TUNEL positive. Three demyelination-negativ e mice infected with 5 PFU A59 did not stain for apoptosis. Apoptotic cells were detected mainly in the white matter at the edges of the demyelinating lesions ( Figure 1D ), though some cells were also seen in the gray matter. Demyelination and apoptosis were not detected in the spinal cords of 28 of 28 infected mice with 5 PFU of MHV-2 or 50 PFU of MHV-2 (18 and 10 mice, respectively). Only rare positive TUNEL staining was seen in 3 of 14 mice infected with 5 PFU of Penn98-1 and Penn98-2. There was no demyelination detected in Penn98-1-and Penn98-2-infected mice (0 of 14). TUNEL staining was not found in 10 of 10 mockinfected control mice. During the chronic stage, TUNEL staining was negative in the brain parenchyma and liver of all MHV-2-or MHV-A59-infected mice.\n\nTo assess the nature of the apoptotic cells during chronic demyelinating infection, we performed double labeling for TUNEL-positive nuclei and immunohistochemical staining for speci c markers of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and macrophages/ microglial cells. TUNEL-positive cells were identied as macrophages/microglial cells, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. A few cells, morphologically consistent with lymphocytes, also appeared to be TUNEL positive. Quanti cation studies of the TUNEL-positive cells demonstrated 3% to 5% CAIIpositive cells ( Figure 1H ), 1% to 2% glial brillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells ( Figure 1G ), and 70% of the cells were double stained with F4/80 (a mouse microglial/macrophage marker) ( Figure 1I ) out of all TUNEL-positive stained cells. The oligodendrocytic markers including CAII, (MBP), or cNPase are notoriously weaker than GFAP on formalin-xed tissue. In order to be able to detect double staining in oligodendrocytes , the concentration of the TUNEL signal had to be decreased. Nevertheless, we clearly detected TUNEL-positive labeling in CAII ( Figure 1H ) and cNPase (not shown)-positive oligodendrocytes .\n\nIn this study we evaluate the effect of apoptosis on the acute and the chronic stages of MHV-induced disease in mice. We use different strains and recombinant viruses with various biologic phenotypes to assess the contribution of apoptosis to the different components of the pathologic process, especially demyelination. Having the advantage of the different biologic phenotypes of the virus, we are able to show for the rst time that apoptosis correlates with the pathologic damage in MHV infection. During acute infection, apoptosis is found in the livers of all three viral phenotypes, as all three viruses cause hepatitis. TUNEL-positive cells are also seen in acute encephalitis; however, the intensity of staining does not always correlate with the intensity of the pathologic process. Whereas acute encephalitis in MHV-A59 infection is associated with extensive TUNEL-positive cells, the encephalitis caused by Penn98-1 and Penn98-2 is not accompanied by extensive TUNEL staining. We have previously shown that acute encephalitis caused by Penn98-1 and Penn98-2 is similar to MHV-A59-induced encephalitis in viral titers, in ammatory in ltration, and viral antigen distribution (Das Sarma et al, 2000) . The reduced ability of the Penn98 viruses to cause apoptosis may be an inherent property of these viruses, unrelated to CNS viral load. TUNEL staining was not detected in brain parenchyma of MHV-2-infected mice, consistent with a lack of brain parenchymal involvement in MHV infection (Das Sarma et al, 2001b) .\n\nApoptosis in MHV infection occurs in both in ammatory and parenchymal cells. Morphological identi cation of apoptotsis in hepatocytes in the liver and in neurons in the olfactory bulb supports the hypothesis that at least some of the parenchymal cell death during acute infection is due to apoptosis. Apoptotic cells are prevalent in regions of high viral titers (Fishman et al, 1985; Lavi et al, 1988) , but colabeling of TUNEL and viral antigen was seen only in a few cells in brain and liver. Also, TUNEL staining is not present in all dying cells, suggesting that apoptosis is not an exclusive path of cell death in this infection, and that a signi cant number of cells were also undergoing necrosis. The virus may induce apoptosis directly in infected cells or indirectly in uninfected cells by mediator molecules such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) secreted by infected cells. An et al (1999) showed that MHV-A59 causes apoptosis in vitro in 17CL-1 cells, but not in DBT cells, in spite of productive infection in both cell lines; this indicates that apoptosis is not a universal mechanism of cell death in MHV infection.\n\nDuring the chronic stage of disease, TUNELpositive cells correlate very well with the demyelinating lesions in the spinal cord. Only demyelinated mice infected with MHV-A59 exhibit a signi cant amount of TUNEL-positive staining during the chronic stage of disease. There is no signi cant amount of TUNEL staining in any of the demyelination-negativ e mice infected with MHV-2, Penn98-1, or Penn98-2. This may suggest that apoptosis plays an active role in the process of demyelination in MHV infection. Additional studies are necessary to determine whether the site of molecular determinants of apoptosis is in the S gene as it has been shown for other biologic properties of the virus (Das Sarma et al, 2000 Sarma et al, , 2001a Navas et al, 2001) .\n\nAmong the TUNEL-positive cells during demyelination, macrophages/microglial cells represented the majority of the TUNEL-positive cells. Proliferating macrophages and microglial cells play a very important role in the demyelinating process and apoptosis may be a mechanism of controlling the number of these cells in areas of damage. The distribution of F4/80C cells is found to be mainly in the center of the demyelinated lesion, as has been shown in other experimental systems of demyelination. Their role in demyelination is still debated, because these cells may have both functions that may indicate active role in demyelination or just as phagocytic elements to collect the myelin and cellular debris from the lesion. Similar role may be attributed to the apoptosis found in a small number of astrocytes near areas of damage. Apoptosis may represent a mechanism of controlling the level of proliferating astrocytes in reactive gliosis. However, TUNEL staining is also detected in CAIIpositive oligodendrocytes. Because TUNEL staining usually indicates an irreversible stage in the life of a cell, the presence of apoptosis in oligodendrocytes suggests that at least part of the demyelinating process is due to programmed cell death in oligodendrocytes. In the CNS, a single oligodendrocyte is responsible for the myelination of a large number of axons. The loss of only very few oligodendrocytes can account for extensive demyelinating damage. Moreover, apoptosis is usually a fast event and fragments of apoptotic cells are quickly phagocytosed (Majno and Joris, 1995) and only a small amount of ongoing active demyelination can be detected at any given time point. Thus, we conclude that, even if only a small number of oligodendrocytes in areas adjacent to the areas of demyelination are detected containing TUNEL staining at any particular time point in MHV infection, apoptosis is nevertheless a signi cant factor in MHV-induced demyelination. The fact that the majority of the apoptotic cells were macrophages and lymphocytes, as also reported in JHM infection (Wu and Perlman, 1999) , should not diminish the importance of apoptotic parenchymal cells.\n\nApoptosis has been observed in a wide variety of neurological diseases and in various viral infections. Apoptosis in oligodendrocytes was also reported following Theiler\u201as virus infection (Tsunoda et al, 1997) . The role of apoptosis in the pathogenesis of MS is not completely clear. Apoptosis is observed in association with demyelinating lesions in patients with MS, and up to 40% of apoptotic cells in postmortem chronic MS lesions are identi ed as oligodendrocytes (Dowling et al, 1997) . Up-regulation of Fas antigen on oligodendrocytes and increase of the soluble form of the antigen in the cerebrospinal uid (CSF) and the serum of patients were also reported (Ciusani et al, 1998; Zipp et al, 1998) . On the other hand, expression of Fas was reported on oligodendrocytes, and oligodendrocytes death was presumed to be associated with this expression, but without evidence of apoptosis (D'Souza et al, 1996) . Others do not nd a difference in Fas soluble levels in the serum between patients with MS and controls (Bansil et al, 1997) .\n\nApoptotic in ammatory cells, resident target cells, and apoptotic molecules are detected in the CNS in the three main experimental animal models of demyelination: TMEV, EAE, and MHV. However, no conclusions have been reached regarding the direct role of apoptosis in the demyelinating process. Barac-Latas et al (1997) demonstrate both apoptotic and necrotic oligodendrocytes following MHV-JHM infection, and Tsunoda and Fujinami (1996) detect oligodendrocytes apoptosis in EAE and TMEV, whereas Bonetti shows up-regulation of Fas molecules on oligodendrocytes in EAE, which were found abundantly in the CD3C cells undergoing apoptosis, but nds no other features of apoptosis .\n\nIn conclusion, apoptosis may play an important role in both acute and chronic MHV disease, most signi cantly in demyelination. The small number of the apoptotic cells, and the distribution of these cells at the periphery of the demyelinating lesion, are consistent with the nature of the demyelinating process. The relationship between apoptosis, in ammation, and tissue damage needs further investigation, perhaps by further dissection of the apoptotic cascade.\n\nViruses MHV-A59 (Budzilowicz et al, 1985; Lavi et al, 1984b) , MHV-2 (Keck et al, 1988) , and Penn98-1 and Penn98-2 (Das Sarma et al, 2000) were used in this study. Viruses were grown and viral titers were determined on L2 cells by standard plaque assays (Lavi et al, 1984b) .\n\nPathogen-free, 4-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were injected intracerebrall y (IC) with 2.5 \u00a3 10 3 , 25, and 5 plaque-forming units (PFU) of MHV-A59; 50 and 5 PFU of MHV-2, Penn98-1, or Penn98-2. Mock-infected mice were injected IC with L2 cell lysate. For electron microscopy analysis, mice were infected intranasally (IN) with 5 \u00a3 10 9 PFU/ml of MHV-A59 or mock-infected intranasally with cell lysate. The IN injection increased the concentration of infected cells in the olfactory bulbs and therefore was ideal for EM studies. As we have previously shown, the disease process in IC and IN inoculations is similar (Lavi et al, 1984b (Lavi et al, , 1986 (Lavi et al, , 1988 .\n\nMice were sacri ced on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 30 (two to three mice per time point per virus during the acute stage and 53 mice on day 30). All mice were perfused transcardially with phosphate-buffered saline. Brain, spinal cord, and liver were removed and xed in 10% normal-buffered formalin at room temperature for 48 h, embedded in paraf n, and sectioned into 5 \u00b9m. For examination of demyelination and in ammation, sections were stained with luxol fast blue (LFB) and hematoxylin and eosin, respectively.\n\nThe intensity of hepatitis was evaluated based on the following criteria: 0, no lesions are detected; 1, rare (one or two) necrotic in ammatory lesions are detected in each liver section; 2, several (three to ve) necrotic lesions are identi ed in each liver section; 3, severe hepatitis consisting of more than ve separate lesions in each section; 4, con uent liver damage with bridging hepatitis lesions throughout each section. The intensity of encephalitis was evaluated in the following manner: 0, no lesions; 1, rare focal perivascular in ammatory in ltrates; 2, mild multifocal in ammatory in ltrates and microglial proliferation; 3, severe multifocal encephalitis; 4, panencephalitis involving every region of the brain.\n\nDetection of in situ DNA fragmentation was done with uorescein in situ cell death detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) as speci ed by the manufacturer. Quantitative intensity of apoptotic staining was divided into 4 levels: 1, mild (20-100 cells/section); 2, moderate (100-200 cells/section); 3, severe (200-350 cells/section); 4, extremely severe (>350 cells/section).\n\nDouble labeling was performed with TUNEL and MHV antibodies or cell-speci c markers. After completion of TUNEL staining using nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT)/5-bromo-4-chloro 3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP) as a staining substrate, a 1:200 dilution of rabbit anti-MHV-A59 polyclonal antibody and 1:100 dilution of monoclonal GFAP (Lee et al, 1984) were applied for 2 h at 37 \u00b1 C, respectively. Immunohistochemical staining was done by the UltraProbe kit (Biomeda, Foster City, CA), applying secondary biotinylated antibody for 15 min at 37 \u00b1 C, followed by the avidin-phosphatase reagent for 15 min at 37 \u00b1 C. Fast-red (Biomeda) was used as the staining substrate. Double labeling for oligodendrocytes or macrophage speci c markers was done as follows. Sections were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, then incubated with carbonic anhydrase II (1:500 dilution) (Cammer et al, 1985) , or rat anti-mouse F4/80 antigen (1:500, Serotec, Raleigh, NC) for 2 h at 37 \u00b1 C. Immunohistochemical staining was then done as T Schwartz et al described above with Vector blue (Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA) as the staining substrate. After the completion of the immunohistochemical staining, we applied the TUNEL reaction, using Fast-red (Biomeda) as the staining substrate. Negative controls included the omission of the primary antibodies, the omission of the TUNEL labeling mixture, or the application of primary irrelevant antibodies at the same concentration. We evaluated labeling by light microscopy, and the quanti cation of double staining was expressed as the number of positive double-stained cells per section. Two to three sections were evaluated for each one of the antibodies."}
