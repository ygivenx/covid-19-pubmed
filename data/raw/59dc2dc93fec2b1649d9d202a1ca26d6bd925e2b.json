{"title": "Viral Agents in Marmoset Colitis", "body": "sets (15) . Nonbacterial ulcerative colitis occurs in the gorilla (16) , orangutan (16) , gibbon (17) , and marmoset (18) . The finding of coronavirus in a high percentage of marmosets with colitis raises the possibility that the virus may play an etiological role. However, it is just as plausible that the agent is an opportunistic secondary invader of no primary pathogenic significance. However, in this event, the organism could serve to perpetuate inflammation initiated by another agent, or it could be completely innocuous. To define the role of coronavirus in marmoset colitis, prospective studies correlating the incidence of colitis with the occurrence of these viruses will be required, and immunofluorescent and/or nuclear probe techniques will have to be utilized to determine in vivo infectivity."}
