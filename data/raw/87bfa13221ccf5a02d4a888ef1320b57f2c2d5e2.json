{"title": "REPROGRAMMED PTEROPUS BAT STEM CELLS PRESENT DISTINCT IMMUNE SIGNATURE AND ARE HIGHLY PERMISSIVE FOR 2 HENIPAVIRUSES 3 4 5 Summary sentence: Somatic reprogramming provides new bat stem cells with unique immune", "body": "Emergence of zoonotic diseases is increasing globally; thus the ability to predict and prevent viral 3 epidemics is a major objective for public health organizations. Among all emerging infectious 4 diseases, approximately 60% are of zoonotic origin 1 . Bats host a large number of human and animal 5 zoonotic viruses, including Henipaviruses 2 (Nipah (NiV) and Hendra (HeV)), Coronaviruses (Severe 6 Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) 3 and Middle East Respiratory (MERS-CoV)) 4 , and 7 Filoviruses (Marburg 5 and Ebola viruses 6 ). These agents are among the most virulent pathogens 8 emerging from animal reservoirs and are capable of infecting a broad range of species, including 9 humans, while remaining asymptomatic in bats. Transmission of NiV from bats to humans occurs 10 either through intermediate host contamination 7, 8 or directly 9 via consumption of fruits or raw date 11 palm juice contaminated with bat saliva or urine. In the case of NiV-Bangladesh isolates, this may be 12 followed by inter-human transmission 10 . Henipaviruses are negative strand RNA viruses; both NiV 13 and HeV are responsible for outbreaks of respiratory and neurological diseases in Southeast Asia and 14 Australia, respectively, with a fatality rate of 40-100% 11 . NiV and Henipa-like viruses have been 15 detected molecularly and/or serologically in Pteropus bats from different Asian and African 16 Countries 12 , and worldwide distribution of these bat species poses a threat of future NiV pandemics 13 . 17 Bats are an ancient and diverse group of animals (the second largest order of mammals after rodents), 18 representing around 20% of all mammalian species 14 . Indeed, they are the most abundant and widely 19 distributed non-human mammalian species worldwide 15 . Bats, the only mammals capable of powered 20 flight, show extraordinary longevity compared with their corporal mass 16, 17 . Phylogenetic analyses 21 based on molecular data classified bats into two suborders: Yangochiroptera (microbat families) and 22 Yinpterochiroptera (including the non-echolocating Pteropodidae family, which contains the 23 Pteropus genus and the echolocating Rhinolophoidea) 18 . A large number of novel bat virus sequences 24 was identified in these two bat suborders, which diverged over 50 million years ago, suggesting a 25 long co-evolutionary history of bats and their viruses that have shaped unique host-pathogen 26 relationships 19 . In addition, bats harbor a markedly higher proportion of zoonotic viruses than other 27 mammalian orders 20,21 . Although bat serology and viral genome sequencing permit detection of a 28 number of bat viruses, isolating them has been far more challenging. Studying the bat immune system 29 and bat/virus interactions provides valuable insight into the mechanisms underlying successful 30 control of viral infection, and may lead to novel approaches to managing viral spillover and 31 development of new antiviral strategies for humans 22 . As infection studies in bats are difficult to 32 implement due to the animal facility constraints and the absence of bat husbandry, it is crucial to 33 author/funder. All rights reserved.

In humans, the cellular targets of Henipaviruses are endothelial, 4 epithelial, and neural cells. Although several cell lines from Pteropus bats have been established, 5 most are immortalized primary cells (PCs) with fibroblast-like morphology. Utilization of high 6 multiplicities of infection by most studies 25 suggests that these cells show low permissiveness for 7 Henipavirus infection and replication. The use of primary and immortalized cells limits our ability to 8 isolate and study viruses that may show tropism for cell types that are more difficult to establish as a 9 primary culture or to immortalize, thereby emphasizing the need to develop more appropriate 10 Pteropus bat cells with different phenotypes. mice, then in humans, rats, and non-human primates, the process has been tested (with variable 16 success) in a large number of mammalian species, including rabbits, sheep, bovines, pigs, horses, 17 dogs, and even in some endangered species [27] [28] [29] ; however, despite the importance of bats to ecology 18 and immunovirology, and although certain attempts have been made in that direction 30 , somatic 19 reprogramming of primary bat cells has not been examined rigorously.\n\nHere, we generated Pteropus bat reprogrammed stem cells (RSCs) from PCs using a novel 21 combination of three transcription factors: ESRRB, CDX2 and c-MYC. These cells exhibit typical 22 PSC morphology, are recognized by SSEA-1 and EMA-1 stem-cell-specific antibodies, display PSC-23 specific chromatin features, and express a set of neural stem cell-associated genes. These 24 reprogrammed cells are much more highly susceptible to virus infection than the parental primary bat 25 cells, making them a new cell type that can be used to isolate novel bat viruses and study host-26 pathogen interactions. Interestingly, in contrast to stem cells from other mammalian species, bat RSCs 27 are capable of both responding to and producing IFN-I, and present a unique interferon-stimulated 28 gene (ISG) transcriptomic signature, suggesting some fundamental differences between bats and 29 other mammals. This new cell model is an important experimental tool that will improve 30 understanding of the unique properties of bat/virus interactions and will help to decipher novel aspects 31 of bat biology. 32 author/funder.

Explants derived from Pteropus bat trachea 2 (PTC), lung (PTL), and alary membrane skin (PAC) were cultured in gelatin-coated wells either in 3 fibroblast medium (FM) or in ES derived medium (ESM1). Individual cells emerged from these 4 explants at 5, 15, and 30 days after plating, respectively; all cells exhibited a fibroblastic morphology, 5 with an elongated and often flattened shape (Fig. 1a-c) . PLCs entered senescence after 4 to 5 6 generations, while PACs became senescent after 10-11 generations; by contrast, PTCs continued to 7 proliferate for more than 30 generations (200 days of continuous culture), although there was a slow, 8 progressive and irreversible decrease in the proliferation rate during that time (Fig. 1d) . These results Reprogramming of primary Pteropus bat cells. We wanted to obtain bat cells with stem cell 13 features and the ability to proliferate long-term but did not want to use immortalizing agents.\n\n14 Therefore, we used a somatic reprograming approach to introduce selected \"reprogramming\" genes 15 into PCs. Based on the partially annotated genome of P. vampyrus, alignment of protein sequences 16 derived from human and P. vampyrus genes revealed identities ranging from 87-99% between seven 17 major reprogramming human genes, with the noticeable exception of NANOG, which showed only 18 70% identity (Supplementary Table 1 ). Therefore, we first used Sendai viruses to introduce the human 19 OSKM gene combination into bat PCs in the presence or absence of NANOG, which was expressed 20 through a transposon. Although the genes were delivered and expressed efficiently (Supplementary 21 Fig. 1b) , no long-term morphological changes were observed up to 100 days post-infection 22 ( Supplementary Fig. 1a ). Delivering the same gene combination using inducible transposon vectors 23 did not provide a better result, although an increase in cellular proliferation was observed, along with 24 transient and partial morphological changes ( Supplementary Fig. 1c, d) . 25 Next, we screened additional transcription factors for their ability to induce somatic (Fig. 1e) ; however, a longer period (35 days) was required when cells were cultured in 31 serum-containing ESM medium (Fig. 1f) . Stable proliferation of bat RSCs has continued for more 32 author/funder. All rights reserved.

The average doubling time in EPI 1 medium was estimated to be around 24 h, and that in ESM medium around 35 h. Bat RSCs show stem cell-like characteristics. Bat RSCs grew in compact colonies in both EPI and 4 ESM medium, with a morphology typical of PSCs: small and round, with a large nucleus, a high 5 nucleo-cytoplasm ratio, and a prominent nucleolus (Fig. 2a) . Electron microscopy confirmed that the 6 morphology and ultrastructure of bat RSCs was very different from that of bat PCs. In particular, 7 chromatin was distributed homogeneously throughout the nucleoplasm, without large zones of (Fig. 3a) . Furthermore, 3506 genes were differentially expressed between bat PCs and bat RSCs, with 28 a log -fold change > 2 (LFC > 2) and a p-value > 0.05 (Supplementary Table 2 ). When cultured in 29 either medium during reprograming, bat RSCs did not express key genes related to pluripotency, such 30 as POU5F1/OCT4 and NANOG; noticeable exceptions were SOX2 and ZSCAN4, which play roles 31 in telomere maintenance and long-term-genomic stability in ES cells 35 . This suggests that the 32 reprogramming factors introduced into the cells induced a new cell type. String analysis on the first 33 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Further GO analysis of these 2 823 DEGs indicated that the first three GO terms for biological processes were \"nervous system 3 development\" (GO:0007399), \"generation of neurons\" (GO:0048699) and \"neurogenesis\" 4 (GO:0022008) (Supplementary Table 4 ). The most important GO terms for molecular function were 5 \"inorganic molecular entity transmembrane transporter activity\" (GO:0015318), \"ion transmembrane Table 4 ). 9 Additional analysis of the main gene clusters revealed that the most important cluster contained 27 10 members (Cluster 27, Fig. 3b ) and was centered on GRIA1 and GRIK2; this cluster harbored 11 numerous specific neural-associated receptors for neurotransmitters (e.g., GABA and 5- Table 3 ). These expression profiles suggest that the reprogramming process gave rise 19 to a new neural-related stem cell type that differs from the initial PCs and shares features with PSCs 20 described in other species. Interestingly, ephrin B2 (EFNB2), a receptor for Henipavirus entry, was 21 among the main DEGs and was expressed at much higher levels in bat RSCs than in bat PCs 22 (Supplementary Table 2 ). Such an expression profile suggests the possibility of Henipavirus entry 23 into these cells. We tested this in the following experiments. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/846410 doi: bioRxiv preprint 8 flow cytometry 6 h later (Fig. 4a) . In contrast to bat PCs, bat RSCs were susceptible to infection with 1 all four tested viruses. Henipaviruses entered bat RSCs much more readily than bat PCs and, 2 interestingly, more readily than Vero cells, which are commonly used to isolate and propagate 3 Henipavirus. Next, we examined the transcription and replication kinetics of NiV by RT-qPCR and 4 viral titration after infection of cells with virus at a low MOI (0.1 PFU/cell) (Fig. 4b, c) . In bat RSCs, 5 NiV RNA synthesis and production of viral particles increased by 4 log10 units between 0 h and 24 h Innate immune responses of bat RSCs. As innate immunity is the first line of defense against viral 14 infection, we next analyzed innate responses of bat RSC and compared them with those of bat PCs. 15 First, we performed a comparative analysis of ISG expression in non-stimulated bat PCs and RSCs 16 at the global transcriptomic level. Taking advantage of a consensus list of ISGs 36 , we identified 17 differential expression of 174 ISGs in the two cells types (Fig. 5a) . Analysis identified two main sets 18 of genes, one expressed at higher levels in bat RSCs (14 genes with a LFC > -2) and another expressed 19 at higher levels in bat PCs (83 genes with a LFC > 2) (Supplementary Table 5 ). The second set 20 contained a much higher number of genes, suggesting that reprogrammed cells expressed fewer ISGs 21 and that these cells had weaker antiviral capacity. In particular, the interferon-regulated factor 1 22 (IRF1) gene network was down-regulated in bat RSCs (Fig. 5b, Supplementary Table 6 ). This specific 23 intrinsic ISG signature may be one of the mechanisms underlying higher susceptibility of bat RSCs 24 to infection by Henipavirus. Further functional approaches will help to identify which specific genes 25 among those differentially expressed are implicated in bat antiviral responses.

Next, we analyzed the effect of infection with a negative strand RNA virus, VSV, which 2 stimulates the TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5 pathways (Fig. 6b) . In contrast to stimulation with polyI:C, 3 VSV induced similar responses in both bat RSCs and bat PCs: VSV activated expression of IFN\u03b1, 4 IFN\u03b2 and ISG56 expression, but not that of MX1 or PKR. Finally, stimulation of bat RSCs and bat 5 PCs with IFN-I, known to activate the intracellular JAK-STAT pathway, induced similar responses 6 in both cell types, characterized by IFN dose-dependent expression of MX1, ISG56, and PKR mRNA 7 (Fig. 6c) . These results suggest that bat RSCs produce and respond to IFN-I, similar to bat PCs; 8 however, some intracellular signaling pathways, especially those related to the TLR3 pathway, seem 9 to be activated differently. The high permissiveness of bat RSCs reported herein (even higher than that of Vero cells routinely 22 used for virus isolation and production) provides an important new tool for further studies. This cell 23 model should bridge an existing gap in this field, facilitate optimization of viral discovery in bats 39 , 24 and allow further research into bat biology at the cellular and molecular level. 25 In recent years, somatic reprogramming has become a powerful method for generating PSCs The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/846410 doi: bioRxiv preprint in our unstimulated primary and reprogrammed bat cells is different from that expressed by 1 immortalized cell lines, possibly due to absence of immortalization-activated programs, which may 2 have affected ISG expression by bat cell lines in the previous study. Important differences in innate 3 immune signatures between undifferentiated stem cells and their differentiated progeny have been 4 described for several mammalian species; these differences lead to high resistance of stem cells to female specimen found naturally dead, and wing-membrane skin biopsies were obtained during the 33 author/funder.
