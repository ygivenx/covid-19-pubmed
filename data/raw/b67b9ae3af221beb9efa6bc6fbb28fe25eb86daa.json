{"title": "Isolation of human monoclonal antibodies from peripheral blood B cells", "body": "Recent advances in the isolation, culture and expansion of human B cells and the recovery of genes encoding immunoglobulin (Ig) are enabling the isolation of large numbers of antibodies to be used for probing the humoral immune response and developing diagnostics and therapeutics. The history of these advances and the use of these techniques were recently described in a comprehensive review 1 . For several decades, mouse monoclonal antibodies were isolated using the hybridoma technology 2 . However, the therapeutic application of these antibodies was limited by induction of anti-mouse antibodies and autoreactivity. More recently, monoclonal antibodies have been isolated through phage display libraries produced from humans with a humoral response of interest 3, 4 . Although this technique has produced numerous useful antibodies, its applicability is limited by differences in binding properties between antibodies expressed in bacterial and eukaryotic cells. In addition, phage display may result in heavy-and light-chain combinations that do not occur in the same B cell in vivo. Human B cells have also been immortalized by electrofusion 5 or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformation [6] [7] [8] , with or without the use of toll-like receptor ligands. However, these techniques can be inefficient in some patients, such as those with HIV infection, and transformed clones can be lost because of instability.\n\nIn studies published since 2008, direct cloning of Ig-encoding genes from isolated B cells and their expression as monoclonal antibodies have bypassed many of these limitations and enabled the isolation of antibodies that are particularly rare or difficult to clone 9, 10 . This technique involves PCR amplification of Ig-encoding genes from B cells, cloning them into an expression vector and re-expression in 293T cells. To produce human monoclonal antibodies with a given specificity, two methods have been applied to isolate B cell populations of interest. In the first approach, plasmablasts have been isolated from the peripheral blood of infected or vaccinated patients 11 . This technique relies on the expansion of antigen-specific B cells within the plasmablast population in the peripheral blood 5-7 d after infection or vaccination. In the second approach, fluorescently labeled antigens have been used to stain and sort antigen-specific memory B cells before cloning. HIV envelope (Env) trimers have been used for this purpose to isolate broadly neutralizing antibodies to 13) . Similarly, the broad and potent HIV-neutralizing antibody VRC01 was cloned using modified Env antigens. Peripheral blood B cells were stained with both a resurfaced core Env (RSC3) and a RSC with a point mutation in the CD4-binding site. Implementation of this technique made possible the isolation of cells specific for the CD4binding sites that were used in expression cloning. However, for some antigens, such as HIV Env, there is considerable nonspecific background binding to B cells or other cells. Furthermore, only a small subset of B cells that bind a given antigen may have the effector function of interest. The use of modified antigens, such as RSC3, also requires prior knowledge of the specificity of interest.\n\nIn 2009, HIV-specific human monoclonal antibodies were isolated using an approach that enabled the examination of a broader range of peripheral blood B cells 14 . In that study, memory B cells were sorted, plated at a density of 1.3 cells per well, expanded in vitro with the addition of feeder cells and conditioned medium generated from mitogen-stimulated human T cells, and then the supernatants were screened for neutralization using a highthroughput technique 14 . The genes encoding Ig were then cloned from wells with neutralizing activity. In theory, this strategy enables researchers to isolate a large variety of antibodies with an effector function of interest without prior knowledge of specificity. However, the method for the isolation and in vitro expansion of B cells has remained proprietary. Recently, broadly neutralizing influenza hemagglutinin-specific antibodies were isolated from vaccinated or recently infected patients using IL-6 in microculture of sorted plasma cells 15 . In another study, researchers cultured eight cells per well after EBV transformation and plated the cultured cells with CD40L-expressing cells, a TLR9 agonist and a CHK2 kinase inhibitor 8 . However, implementation of this method potentially raises the same concerns noted above regarding the efficiency and stability of EBV transformation of B cells isolated from patients with HIV infection. Thus, there continues to be a need in the field for more widely applicable techniques for the isolation of monoclonal antibodies.\n\nOur goal was to develop a simple, high-throughput method to isolate and expand memory B cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) that did not require transformation, fusion, transduction or activated T cell supernatant, and which produced at least 10 ng ml \u22121 of secreted IgG, the threshold for our microneutralization screening assay. Recently, we developed a technique in which peripheral blood B cells are plated in 384-well plates, similarly to the strategy noted above, and then B cells are stimulated and expanded over 13 d of culture. It is a major challenge for previously frozen primary B cells to survive culture at near-clonal density for up to 2 weeks and to overcome their highly proapoptotic state after activation 16 . To overcome this challenge, we tested multiple conditions known to enhance B cell survival or proliferation, including adding any of the following to the culture medium: The technique uses a negative isolation strategy that limits activation-induced cell death. This approach also enables the isolation of cells with low expression levels of surface IgG, such as plasmablasts. Cells are then stimulated to proliferate and produce IgG by culturing with CD40L-expressing feeder cells and IL-2, as well as IL-21, a potent inducer of antibodysecreting plasma cells 17 . We optimized the concentration of each of these components individually and in combination to maximize the concentrations of IgG produced (typically 0.2-1 \u03bcg ml \u22121 ). In our experience, when four cells per well are plated, we observe an average of 76% of wells that contain more than 10 ng ml \u22121 of IgG. This yield translates into a 77% efficiency overall, on the basis of a Poisson distribution predicting that 98% of wells would receive a minimum of one B cell. In the wells that we have selected for cloning, we recover at least one heavy or light chain 100% of the time. In 24% of cases, we are able to recover a matching number of heavy and light chains. We recommend aiming to achieve seeding densities between 1.3 and 4 B cells per well. A higher density of B cells in microwells will reduce the number of plates needed to screen the same number of B cells; however, it will also increase the difficulties in antibody cloning, as all combinations of heavy and light chains obtained from a well must be paired and expressed to regenerate the natural heavy-and light-chain pairing. Thus, the choice of seeding density depends on the individual laboratory's ability to handle large numbers of B cell culture plates as well as its capacity for the downstream steps of cloning, protein expression and functional assays.\n\nWe have recently used this method to isolate the broad and potent HIV-specific neutralizing antibodies named 10E8 and 7H6 (ref. 18 ). This technique can be used for the isolation of peripheral blood B cells before expression cloning. Although it has been optimized for use in humans, it is probably readily adaptable to other species. This method of discovery of novel monoclonal antibodies, in combination with specificity mapping, crystal structure and next-generation sequencing, can be a powerful tool for the understanding of both the fundamental basis of an immune response to an antigen and the evolution of the response 19 .\n\nThe following protocol can be performed manually or with a robotic liquid transfer system. Typically, for a manual setup, twenty 384-well plates are used, and the timing below is for two experimenters working together. For a robotic setup, 60-80 plates may be used, depending on the yield of B cells from the PBMC sample. At the end of this protocol, supernatants may be collected for their use in a microneutralization assay or screening for other desired functions. \u2022 Liquid nitrogen (Taylor Wharton, cat. no. 24K-kryos)\n\n\u2022 Controlled-rate freezer (Thermo Scientific)\n\n\u2022 Gammacell 1000 irradiator (Nordion International)\n\n\u2022 P1000 pipette (Gilson)\n\n\u2022 Milli-Q academic system (Millipore, cat. no.

Thaw a vial of 10-50 \u00d7 10 6 patient-derived PBMCs by warming it in a 37 \u00b0C water bath until floating ice is visible. Add 1 ml of the prewarmed IMDM/benzonase medium from the 15-ml conical tube to the vial; let the vials sit for 15 s. Move all contents to the 15-ml conical tube containing the warm medium.\n\n12| Centrifuge the conical tube at 335g and 4 \u00b0C for 10 min.\n\n13| Resuspend the PBMCs in 1 ml of PBS-1% (wt/vol) BSA in the original conical tube and transfer a 50-\u03bcl aliquot to each of five new 15-ml conical test tubes for compensation in flow cytometry.\n\n14| Pellet the cells in all six tubes via centrifugation at 335g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C.\n\nResuspend the cell pellet from the original conical tube (tube 1) in 50 \u03bcl of the master mix prepared in Steps 9 and 10.\n\n16| Add 50 \u03bcl of PBS-1% (wt/vol) BSA to each of the five compensation tubes (tubes 2-6). Add a single antibody to four of the tubes as compensation tubes as shown in the table below. One tube (tube 6) without antibody is used as an unstained control. 17| Cover all six tubes in foil and incubate them at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min.\n\n18| Resuspend the cells with 1 ml of PBS-1% (wt/vol) BSA using a p1000. Mix the suspension well and add 2 ml more of PBS-1% (wt/vol) BSA. 21| Store the suspensions at 4 \u00b0C and cover them with foil until you are ready to proceed to cell sorting. We recommend sorting the stained cells within 3 h.\n\n\u25b2 CRITICAL The steps in this subsection are specific to a BD FACSAria II cytometer.\n\nHowever, they can be adapted for any cell sorter.\n\n22| Load the cells onto the cytometer, gate on the CD19 + IgM \u2212 IgA \u2212 IgD \u2212 memory B cells as shown in Figure 1a and run compensation.\n\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP Instead of positive selection of CD19 + IgG + B cells, this protocol implements a negative selection method, and it isolates the CD19 + IgM \u2212 IgA \u2212 IgD \u2212 memory B cells. Staining B cells with anti-human IgG antibody may result in some activation of B cells and a decrease in cell viability during the 13 d of culture.\n\n23| Adjust the flow rate so that the event rate is as close as possible to 13,000 events per second but not higher. Monitor the flow rate during the sorting process.\n\n24| Turn on the cell sorter 30 min before sorting to allow the lasers to warm up. Choose the gates as shown in Figure 1a for sorting.\n\n25| Pour 250 \u03bcl of IMDM medium in a 2-ml sterile microcentrifuge tube, vortex gently to wet the sides of the tube and load it onto the sort block.\n\n26| Begin sorting and collect ~30,000 B cells. This task takes ~20 min to complete. Record the flow data at some point during the sort.\n\n27| Unload the patient-derived PBMC sample and place the remaining sample on ice.\n\nRemove the sort tube from the sort block, and then use a pipette tip to gently wash down its sides using the medium in the tube. 34| Centrifuge the cell suspensions at 335g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. Resuspend the resulting cell pellet in 10 ml of IMDM medium.\n\n35| Calculate the reagent amounts. For 20 plates, an arrangement that corresponds to an overall feeder mixture volume of 350 ml, the composition of the mixture is described in the following table:\n\nComplete IMDM medium 336 ml IL-2 (10,000 U ml \u22121 ) 3.5 ml IL-21 (100 \u03bcg ml \u22121 ) 175 \u03bcl 3T3-msCD40L 10 ml 36| Prepare the feeder mixture as calculated in\n\nStep 35 to achieve a confluent, singlecell layer of 5,000 fibroblasts per well.\n\n37| Set aside 25 ml of the mixture (corresponding to 20 plates) to be used as a 'no-B cell' (non-antibody) control.\n\n38| Label the lids and sides of each plate with numbers and the sort date. Use 12channel pipettes to plate the cells. Angled plate holders may be useful, if the cells are plated with a pipette.\n\n39| Add 100 \u03bcl of sterile dH 2 O to the outer wells (wells A1-A24, P1-P24, B1-O1 and B24-O24; ~7.7 ml of sterile dH 2 O are needed per plate).\n\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP Adding the sterile dH 2 O in the outer wells will diminish evaporation from the inner culture wells. Partial evaporation of medium in the inner wells can negatively affect B cell growth and survival.\n\n40| Before adding B cells to the feeder mixture, plate 50 \u03bcl per well of the feeder mix set aside in Step 37 for the non-antibody control in row D of all plates.\n\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP The culture supernatants of row D will be collected after 13 d and used as no-IgG controls in neutralization screening and compared with the supernatants from other rows.\n\nStep 32 to the remaining feeder mix.\n\n42| Move the cell mixture to large sterile basins, and plate 50 \u03bcl per well in the inner 308 wells (except row D).\n\n43| Ensure that you gently mix the cells in the basin frequently to keep the B cells evenly suspended.\n\nMove the 384-well tissue culture plates to a humidified 5% CO 2 incubator set to 37 \u00b0C.\n\n45| Leave the plates undisturbed in the incubator for 13-14 d.\n\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP The duration of the incubation is extremely important, as incubating the plates for less than 12 d may result in insufficient accumulation of IgG in the supernatants. In contrast, after 15 d, the cultures are expected to die off.\n\nDay 10: visual inspection of plates \u2022 TIMING 0.5 h 46| If you are aiming for the high seeding density of four B cells per well, it may be possible to visualize the expanding B cells in many wells on days 10 and 11. They will be small and refractile. All wells will contain debris from feeder cells, which begin to die on day 3. \u25b2 CRITICAL STEP Make sure the hood is clean to avoid both bacterial and DNA contamination. Do not use a hood that is also used for IgG transfections, as this practice may result in PCR contamination and in amplification of contaminating plasmid sequences in the following steps.\n\n49| Count the number of 384-well plates used for B cell culture that were collected on day 13 and label as many new 384-well plates.\n\n50| Use 12-channel pipettes to move 40 \u03bcl of supernatant from each well of the old plates to a corresponding well on the new plates.\n\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP Make sure that you have plenty of tips on hand before you start.\n\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP To avoid disturbing the B cells, place the tips as far down into the wells as possible. A suitable approach to this task is to touch the bottom lightly, move the tips up slightly and then pull up the supernatants slowly to avoid aspirating B cells before dispensing into new plates.\n\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP If the collection process is performed robotically and the supernatants are intended for a microneutralization assay, transfer 20 \u03bcl to each of the two black opaque 384-well plates.\n\n51| Cover the plates to which the supernatants have been added with aluminized foil seals and put the lids on.\n\n52| Store the supernatant plates at \u221280 \u00b0C for neutralization screening or an appropriate functional assay.\n\n\u25a0 PAUSE POINT The supernatant plates can be stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for up to 6 months.\n\n53| Add 20 \u03bcl of lysis buffer to all wells containing B cells. Cover the plates with aluminized foil seals and put the lids on. Immediately store the B cell lysis plates at \u221280 \u00b0C for future use in Ig gene amplification and cloning.\n\n\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP Take care not to touch the wells with the pipette tips to avoid well-to-well B cell contamination; change the tips when necessary. If robotics are being used, a 'blowout and tip touch' command can be programmed after the dispense command. In this case, the tip is above the plate and does not actually touch it. This command serves to jolt the tips to ensure that any adherent lysis buffer falls into the well.\n\n\u25a0 PAUSE POINT The B cell lysis plates can be stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for up to 2 years.\n\nUse cell supernatants to screen for secreted IgG, to test the binding specificity or neutralization or to implement other functional assays. Genes encoding Ig VH, Ig V\u03ba and V\u03bb from positive wells can be recovered using RT-PCR, cloned into IgG heavy-and light-chain expression vectors and expressed by transfection of 293T cells as described previously 9,21 (Fig. 3) .\n\n? TROUBLESHOOTING-Troubleshooting advice can be found in Table 1 .\n\nSteps Step 45, B cell culture: 13 d\n\nStep 46, day 10-visual inspection of plates: 0.5 h\n\nStep 47, day 12-measurement of IgG concentration in supernatants: 4-5 h\n\nSteps 48-54, day 13-supernatant collection and B cell lysis: 4-5 h if done manually\n\nThis protocol enables researchers to isolate peripheral blood B cells and study the B cell repertoire. Figure 3 shows an overview of the stages involved in the approach described herein, from B cell microculture to re-expression of IgG genes. Figure 1a illustrates the gating strategy of CD19 + IgM \u2212 IgA \u2212 IgD \u2212 memory B cell population. Figure 1b shows the purity of CD19 + IgM \u2212 IgA \u2212 IgD \u2212 B cells after sorting. If the protocol is carried out appropriately, peak levels of IgG can be detected 2 weeks after a B cell-sorting process. Figure 2 shows the IgG concentration when the B cells are cultured at different cell densities after 13 d of culture. A higher percentage of IgG-positive wells were found when cells were seeded in the 384-well plate at 4 cells per well than at 2.5 cells per well. When seeding level was 4 cells per well, 70% of the wells were found to have an IgG concentration above 1.0 \u03bcg ml \u22121 . Therefore, we chose the density of 4 B cells per well to strike a balance between the number of B cells screened and the amount of cloning to be done 18 .\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.
