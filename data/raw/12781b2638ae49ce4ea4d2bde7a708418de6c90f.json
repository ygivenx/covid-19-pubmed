{"title": "Bats and Viruses: a Brief Review", "body": "Australia and several of them involved human infections. The latest outbreaks in 2008 resulted in the death of a veterinarian working with infected horses.\n\nApproximately five years after the first Hendra virus outbreak, a very closely related virus, the Nipah virus, emerged in Malaysia, believed to be the result of a bat-to-pig spillover event(s). This was followed by massive pig-to-pig transmission and eventually led to pig-to-human transmission, and claimed more than 100 human lives in Malaysia and Singapore (4). A different strain of the Nipah virus has since emerged in India and Bangladesh, causing outbreaks almost on a yearly basis, with a mortality of up to 70 to 90%.\n\nEpidemiological investigations suggest that this Nipah virus strain is capable of direct bat-to-human and human-to-human transmission, raising the possibility of a much larger outbreak in humans (13; 15) .\n\nHendra and Nipah viruses are now classified into a separate genus, Henipavirus, in the family Paramyxoviridae (8 \n\nThe severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus was responsible for the first serious and widespread zoonotic disease outbreak of the 21 st century which exhibited efficient human-to-human transmission (23) . Although zoonotic SARS virus strains were isolated from civets and raccoon dogs (12) , and viral genomic materials were detected in cats, \n\nAs one of the most deadly viruses known to infect humans, the origin of Ebola virus remains a mystery.\n\nHowever, a recent study has shown that bats of three Using the emergence of henipavirus as example, we can see these factors all play a role to some degree.\n\nIn Australia, it has been shown that the distribution of Is it unusual that so many emerging zoonotic viruses originated from bats? The answer to this question will be \"yes\" or \"no\" depending on how the question is "}
