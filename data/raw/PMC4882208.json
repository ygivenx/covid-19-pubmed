{"title": "Health response to Hajj mass gathering from emergency perspective, narrative review", "body": "Infection was a frequent feature of the Hajj especially with poor pre-Hajj Health care from Pilgrims came from low-income countries, crowded accommodations. Poor hygiene, unknown medical background, Extreme heat, poor prepared stored food and inadequate pre-Hajj vaccination are leading to many of infectious diseases like respiratory/airborne diseases, Meningitis, food/water borne diseases and blood borne diseases.\n\nThe Respiratory infectious diseases considered most common causes of admission in the hospital at hajj.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\n\nThe response to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) after its emergence as a threat in 2003, the handling in 2009 of influenza A H1N1 and in 2012\u20132013 MERS Coronavirus are shows the potential for severe consequences of infections at Hajj and the ability of properly organized public health plans to stop their spread.\n\nThe concern was that SARS, H1N1 and MERS would be drawn into the Hajj by traveling pilgrims, where it would then locally propagate before being transported back to cities and countries around the world and could amplify and accelerate the global spread of the infection.13, 14, 15, 16, 17\n\nThe Saudi Minster of Health recognized the threat early and instituted a variety of infectious control measures, including18, 19 screening, Monitoring port of entry and isolation for suspected cases, surveillance for infectious diseases epidemiology, and computer-based information systems, laboratory testing, infection control; and provide proper treatment.\n\nSaudi recommendation to all pilgrims to wear surgical facemask when in crowds, hands hygiene and to be vaccinated against seasonal influenza.20, 21\n\nApart from vaccination in a pandemic situation, the effectiveness of yearly influenza vaccination for Hajj pilgrims is questionable because of differences in the viral strains used in vaccines in the northern and southern hemispheres.22, 23\n\nSaudi Ministry of Health reported no cases were detected of SARS, H1N1 and MERS at Hajj since 2003 till 2014.\n\nAfter a Hajj-associated outbreak of N meningitides W135 in 2000 and 2001 there was global spread,24 meningococcal disease is considered risk at Hajj and vaccine should be taken among all pilgrims before arrived to Saudi.25, 26, 27\n\nGastrointestinal illness are considered as third causes of admission at Hajj 2002,28 with low morbidity and mortality rate,29 However in Hajj 1980 the outbreak cholera was reported.30, 31 The recommendation will be personal hygiene and clean environment, adequate rehydration and notification, surveillance any cases at hajj.\n\nThe 2014 Ebola epidemic is one of concern of Hajj 2014 and were some of regulation were taken including not allowed Pilgrims from countries in West Africa to attending Hajj 2014, screening and isolation of suspected cases, surveillance for Ebola diseases and rapid testing and proper treatment. Ministry of health in Saudi Arabia reported no any cases of Ebola viruses at Hajj 2014.\n\nAt end of Hajj activates, all pilgrims should shaving their head which, unsterile razor can be risk of transmission of blood borne disease such as Hepatitis B, C and HIV but there is no evidence for blood borne diseases transmission at the Hajj, Nevertheless, vaccination of Hepatitis B before travel and regulation of sterilized razors can prevent the transmission of blood born diseases.\n\nThe preventive measures to control the infectious diseases as follow updated annual vaccination, enforcement of regulations about food and water security, regulation of head shaving and sterilized razors, Pilgrims awareness for hands hygiene, adequate hydration, facemask use, Sunscreen, Insect repellents, food and water and personal hygiene, avoid severe crowds. Initiate self-treatment as needed, continue usual medications, reporting illness and recommendations about respiratory hygiene. These improvement have taken place at the same time as important changes to infrastructure, including accommodation for pilgrims to reduce overcrowding and risk of spread of infection.32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38\n\nFire is a potential hazard but only a couple of major incidents shown at (Table 1).\n\nThere is fire safety regulation and measured should every pilgrims followed according the civil defense instruction to prevent the fire, all those measures help to avoid fire like makeshift tents were replaced with permanent fiberglass structures; no pilgrim is allowed to set up his own tent. Cooking in the tents is also prohibited and availability of fire Extinguisher in each tent.\n\nThe reasons are high population density, international visibility, and symbolic means through which terrorists might amplify the effects of their actions.51, 56 In July 9, 1989 two bombs exploded, killing 1 pilgrim and wounding another sixteen. Saudi authorities executed 16 Kuwaiti Shia Muslims for the bombings after originally suspecting Iranian terrorists47\n\nMecca in summer time are very hot and Heatstroke cases frequent during the pilgrimage to Mecca, for example August 1985, 2000 cases of heatstroke were reported and more than 1000 of these individuals died within a few days.3\n\nA review of the effect of warm weather showed a strong correlation between high temperatures or humidity and the use of medical care during Hajj more than 1000 deaths from heatstroke in a few days and more than 18 000 people needing treatment in emergency departments for heat exhaustion.58\n\nHeat-related mortality and morbidity are preventable; the risk of heat-related death is increased with old age and pre-existing illnesses, particularly cardiovascular, pulmonary, and psychiatric disorders.59\n\nNon infectious related illness are preventable like stampedes by crowd management and control, grouping and scheduling pilgrims, changes in the construction of the transport system and video monitoring of pilgrims lead to no stampedes since 2006. Also Saudi civil defense were apply restrict safety regulation to prevent fire should every pilgrims followed also they are replaced the tents with permanent fiberglass tents. To prevent heat-related illness, every pilgrims need used sun protection equipment's such as umbrella, sunscreen. Avoid prolonged exposure to heat during hajj activities, drink adequate rehydration solution, using fans, cooling bus, places and accommodation.\n\nA.Residency Training and Hajj:\n\nDue to the annual Hajj pilgrimage, Emergency Medicine training in Saudi Arabia emphasizes mass gathering casualty care, disaster preparedness and ability to cope with multicultural people with no background medical knowledge. Emergency Medicine training programs include a National Hajj Preparation course and mandatory Hajj rotation during the residency program to prepare for this real-world challenge.60\n\nIt is mandatory for R3 (PGY 3) residents in the Saudi Emergency Medicine Program, to do one-month Hajj rotation.\n\nFor 10 years now, every year 10\u201320 residents attend the Hajj, they get exposed to all kinds of emergencies, traumatic and medical, the acuity is often high, because the goal of all pilgrims are to complete their Hajj faith, so they attend wait to emergency in their extreme of sickness.\n\nResidents are also exposed to the EMS activities and pre-hospital care intervention, with extra responsibilities in regard to medical direction and oversight. They are also involved in evacuation plan in all seasonal and permanent hospital in Mecca.B.Research priorities in Hajj:\n\nThe research is important to develop planning, risk management, crowded management, and develop polices and guidelines help to identified issues and possible solutions.\n\nThere is Hajj research center in Mecca role to conduct research annually and submitted their recommendation to high authority of Hajj to evaluate annually.\n\nThis review article confirm that Hajj is oldest and largest mass gathering in all mankind and there is some issues influence the health response such as size of gathering. Diversity of population, climate and health facilities around hajj site, also we discuss the infectious and non infectious related illness in hajj and their prevention methods.\n\nThere is limitation to find RCT articles or well-designed articles talking about Hajj and there is limited articles to review related to hajj.\n\nNone."}
