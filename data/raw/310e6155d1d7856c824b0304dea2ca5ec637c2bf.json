{"title": "Helicobacter pylori VacA Suppresses Lactobacillus acidophilus-Induced Interferon Beta Signaling in Macrophages via Alterations in the Endocytic Pathway", "body": "actin polymerization and phagosome formation in addition to disrupting membrane trafficking in macrophages (5) .\n\nH. pylori has been indicated to utilize several virulence factors facilitating the escape of intracellular degradation in phagocytes. Upon uptake in macrophages, H. pylori initially localizes in phagosomes that coalesce into \"megasomes\" containing multiple bacteria (5, 13) , which has been proposed to cause resistance to intracellular killing (5) . A study by Zheng and coworkers suggested that retention of TACO, a tryptophan aspartate-containing coat protein on phagosomes, impairs fusion of phagosomes and lysosomes in macrophages infected with H. pylori (7) .\n\nIt has been reported that probiotic supplementation to H. pylori eradication therapy increases tolerability and decreases side effects (14) (15) (16) , but the results are contradictory (17) . We have previously shown that the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM is a strong inducer of the Th1-polarizing cytokines interferon beta (IFN-\u2424) and interleukin 12 (IL-12) in dendritic cells (18) (19) (20) . In this study, we investigated whether L. acidophilus is able to modulate the inflammatory response in-duced by H. pylori in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). We utilized whole-genome microarray analysis to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in uptake and processing of the bacteria in addition to the immune response generated. BMDMs were stimulated with either L. acidophilus or H. pylori or with both bacteria in combination. Contrary to our expectations, our results demonstrate that H. pylori is able to block the induction of IFN-\u2424 and IL-12 by L. acidophilus. Furthermore, Rgs1/2, Fgd2, and Dock8, key regulators of the Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 GTPases, respectively, required for the organization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton, were strongly suppressed when H. pylori was added to BMDMs prestimulated with L. acidophilus. This inhibition was independent of the viability of H. pylori or the virulence factor CagPAI but completely dependent on the VacA toxin. Confocal microscopy revealed that the addition of H. pylori to L. acidophilus-treated BMDMs induces alterations in the endocytic pathway that prevent intracellular processing of L. acidophilus and thereby the induction of IFN-\u2424. Thus, H. pylori is able to prevent the activation of innate cytokines that can mod- individual mice were stimulated for 5 h with either L. acidophilus NCFM or H. pylori 251 or prestimulated with L. acidophilus NCFM for 1 h prior to the addition of Helicobacter pylori 251.

Data were classified using hierarchical clustering by genes with Euclidean distances and centroid linkage rules. ulate the adaptive immune response in macrophages via the virulence factor VacA, which possibly allows persistence and limited eradication in the host.\n\nTo compare the gene expression profiles after stimulation with L. acidophilus and H. pylori, murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were stimulated either with L. acidophilus NCFM or with an H. pylori clinical isolate, strain 251, or with both bacteria in combination. Since we wanted to ensure that L. acidophilus is able to interact with the macrophages prior to their encounter with the motile pathogen H. pylori, we added H. pylori 251 to BMDMs after 1 h of prestimulation with L. acidophilus NCFM (cell-bacterium ratio, 1:1). After 5 h, the BMDMs were harvested and genome-wide microarray analysis was performed. In total, 4,181 upregulated and 3,956 downregulated genes were common in the three groups of stimulatory conditions (Fig. 1A) . In the L. acidophilus-stimulated group, 153 genes were exclusively upregulated and 109 genes exclusively downregulated. Upon stimulation with H. pylori alone, 61 genes were exclusively upregulated and 70 genes exclusively downregulated. With both strains in combination, only 2 genes were exclusively upregulated and 22 genes exclusively downregulated. The two groups of BMDMs stimulated with either L. acidophilus or H. pylori alone had 22 upregulated and 2 downregulated genes in common. In contrast, for L. acidophilus stimulation, there were 70 upregulated and 61 downregulated genes, and for H. pylori, there were 109 upregulated and 153 downregulated genes, in common with the BMDMs that were stimulated with both bacteria.\n\nThe top 20 most strongly upregulated genes in BMDMs stimulated with L. acidophilus or H. pylori are listed in Table S1 and Table S2 in the supplemental material, respectively. Analysis of the genes expressed revealed that L. acidophilus strongly induced innate response genes that promote the development of an adaptive immune response, characterized by IL-12 and IFN-\u2424 and the chemokines Cxcl10 and Cxcl11, known to be involved in recruitment of activated T cells to the site of infection (Table S1 ). In contrast, H. pylori induced primarily an innate immune response upregulating the cytokines IL-1\u2424 (Il1b) and IL-1\u2423 (Il1a) and the neutrophil-recruiting chemokines (Cxcl3, Cxcl1, and Cxcl2) (see Table S2 ). Notably, H. pylori strongly induced serum amyloid A 3 (Saa3), an acute-phase reactant elevated in chronic low-grade inflammation (21) , and Socs3 (suppressor of cytokine signaling 3), a negative regulator of cytokine signaling (22) . Figure S1 illustrates a heat map of the genes differentially expressed upon addition of H. pylori, L. acidophilus, or both strains in combination compared to expression in nonstimulated cells (P \u03fd 0.01; fold change of greater than \u03ee2). Figure 1B displays the downregulated genes (blue color) and upregulated genes (red color) induced by L. acidophilus, H. pylori, or both strains in combination compared to L. acidophilus alone (P \u03fd 0.01; fold change of greater than \u03ee2). Blue designates genes expressed at a lower level than with L. acidophilus alone, while red indicates greater expression. Table 1 and Fig. 1B present genes that were either strongly induced or suppressed upon the addition of both L. acidophilus and H. pylori to BMDMs relative to results with L. acidophilus alone. Only two genes were strongly induced: P2rx2 (purinergic receptor P2X, ligand-gated ion channel 2) and Pdxp (pyridoxal [pyridoxine, vitamin B6] phosphatase), both regulators of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, were upregulated 7.7-fold and 3.9-fold, respectively. P2rx2 belongs to the family of ligand-gated ion channels that open in response to ATP (23) . Activation of P2X receptors induces actin cytoskeleton alterations via Rho activation in macrophages (24, 25) . Pdxp is located in the cytosol, colocalizes with the actin cytoskeleton, and acts as a positive regulator of actin filament depolymerization (26) . In total, 12 genes were strongly suppressed ( Table 1 ). The gene encoding IFN-\u2424 (Ifnb) was the most significantly inhibited (18.5-fold) over 41,000 genes and transcripts analyzed. Interleukin 12b (encoded by Il12b) was likewise significantly suppressed (4.3-fold). Other strongly suppressed genes identified were Rgs2 and Rgs1 (regulator of G-protein signalling 2 and 1) (27) , Dock8 (dedicator of cytokinesis 8) (28) , and Fgd2 (FYVE, RhoGEF, and PH domain-containing 2) (29), all involved in signaling of Rho, Rac, or Cdc42 GTPase, which are key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton (P \u03fd 0.01) (30) .\n\nH. pylori blocks production of L. acidophilus-induced IFN-\u2424 and IL-12 in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages. Our microanalysis data revealed that genes encoding the cytokines IFN-\u2424 and IL-12 were strongly inhibited upon the addition of H. pylori to BMDMs prestimulated with L. acidophilus (Table 1) , proteins were determined in the supernatants after 10 h of stimulation ( Fig. 2A) . L. acidophilus induced high expression of IFN-\u2424 (840 pg/ml) and IL-12 (10,700 pg/ ml), whereas H. pylori 251 induced small amounts of IFN-\u2424 and IL-12 (20 pg/ml and 850 pg/ml, respectively). As expected, the addition of H. pylori to BMDMs prestimulated with L. acidophilus significantly suppressed the release of IFN-\u2424 by 90% and that of IL-12 by 66% (*, P \u03fd 0.01).\n\nTo determine whether this inhibition is time dependent, the gene expression of Ifn-\u2424 and Il-12 was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) after 2, 4, 6, and 8 h of stimulation (Fig. 2B) . After 4 h, the expression of Ifn-\u2424 in the L. acidophilus-stimulated BMDMs reached a maximum of 400-fold, whereas H. pylori induced Ifn-\u2424 only 15-fold compared to results for controls. However, when H. pylori was added to BMDMs prestimulated with L. acidophilus, the expression of Ifn-\u2424 was completely blocked, and the expression of Il-12 was strongly reduced (by 94%) at all time points compared to results for BMDMs stimulated with L. acidophilus alone (*, P \u03fd 0.01), indicating that the inhibitory effect is exerted at a very early stage.\n\nIn all of our previous experiments, we added both L. acidophilus and H. pylori at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1:1 to the BMDMs. We next sought to investigate the potency of H. pylori to block the expression of Ifn-\u2424 and added H. pylori to L. acidophilus-stimulated cells at MOIs of 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, and 1:16 (H. pylori-cell ratio) (Fig. 2C ). Even at an MOI as low as 1:8, H. pylori was still able to significantly downregulate the L. acidophilus-induced Ifn-\u2424 expression by 51% (*, P \u03fd 0.01). Only at an MOI of 1:16 the inhibition of Ifn-\u2424 was no longer significant. A similar effect was observed when the expression of Il-12 was measured. Since H. pylori is able to suppress the induction of Ifn-\u2424 and Il-12 at a very low MOI, it is indicated that this inhibitory effect is not restricted to the action of an individual bacterium but rather to a virulence determinant secreted by H. pylori.\n\nNext, we aimed to determine the time point at which H. pylori is no longer able to suppress the induction of Ifn-\u2424 and Il-12 by L. acidophilus (Fig. 2D) . At a preincubation time of 1.5 h with L. acidophilus, H. pylori 251 significantly inhibited the expression of Ifn-\u2424 by 92%, at 2 h by 83%, and at 2.5 h by 63%, compared to results for BMDMs stimulated with L. acidophilus alone (*, P \u03fd 0.01). However, a downregulation of Ifn-\u2424 was no longer evident after 3.5 h of stimulation with L. acidophilus prior to addition of H. pylori 251. A similar but less-pronounced inhibitory effect was observed when the expression of Il-12 was measured, since significant suppression was evident only until the L. acidophilus preincubation time of 2 h prior to addition of H. pylori 251 (*, P \u03fd 0.01). Thus, our results suggest that H. pylori-mediated inhibition of Ifn-\u2424 and Il-12 responses takes place after endocytosis and that cellular uptake and processing of L. acidophilus may be required for an induction of IFN-\u2424 and IL-12.\n\nWe then aimed to confirm this inhibitory effect on other cytokines and chemokines using RT-PCR. Expression levels of the T cell-and macrophage-recruiting chemokine gene Cxcl10, as well as those of the proinflammatory cytokine genes Tnf-\u2423 and IL-1b, were analyzed after 4 h (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). Our results show that the addition of H. pylori 251 to BMDMs preincubated with L. acidophilus is able to significantly downregulate the expression of Cxcl10 and Tnf-\u2423 (*, P \u03fd 0.01). However, the expression of IL-1\u2424 was significantly upregulated by the addition of H. pylori 251 to BMDMs preincubated with L. acidophilus compared to results with L. acidophilus alone (*, P \u03fd 0.01), which is in accordance with our microarray results. Thus, we hereby demonstrate that H. pylori is able to inhibit the activation of cytokines that modulate an adaptive immune response but has an additive effect on IL-1\u2424 when added to BMDMs prestimulated with L. acidophilus.\n\nInhibition of IFN-\u2424 by H. pylori is independent of viability and the virulence factor CagPAI but dependent on the toxin VacA. To establish the role of the virulence factor CagPAI in blocking the expression of IFN-\u2424, we added isogenic H. pylori 251 CagPAI mutant bacteria to BMDMs preincubated with L. acidophilus and measured the gene expression of Ifn-\u2424 after 4 h (Fig. 3A) . The H. pylori 251 CagPAI mutant inhibited Ifn-\u2424 expression in BMDMs preincubated with L. acidophilus to a level equivalent to that of the wild-type H. pylori 251 strain, indicating that the inhibitory effect is independent of CagPAI. To determine whether bacterial viability is essential, we added heat-killed (HK) H. pylori 251 and HK 251 CagPAI mutant to BMDMs prestimulated with L. acidophilus and measured the level of IFN-\u2424 in the supernatants (Fig. 3B) . Both HK H. pylori strains were capable of significantly blocking L. acidophilus-induced IFN-\u2424 (*, P \u03fd 0.01). Hence, our findings suggest that the inhibitory effect of H. pylori on IFN-\u2424 expression in L. acidophilus-stimulated BMDMs is dependent neither on bacterial viability nor on the presence of CagPAI.\n\nOur microarray analysis revealed that key regulators of the Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 GTPases are strongly suppressed upon stimulation of BMDMs with L. acidophilus and H. pylori in combination. Entry of the H. pylori VacA toxin into epithelial cells is dependent on pinocytosis and controlled by the Cdc42 GTPase (31) . Furthermore, in epithelial cells, VacA utilizes the Rac1 GTPase to induce cell vacuolation in host cells (32) . We therefore speculated that the H. pylori VacA toxin may also play a role in macrophages and may be implicated in the inhibition of Ifn-\u2424 (Fig. 3C ). Our hypothesis was confirmed, since an isogenic H. pylori 251 vacA mutant, in contrast to the wild-type strain, was unable to block Ifn-\u2424 when added to BMDMs prestimulated with L. acidophilus (P \u03fd 0.01). To recapitulate that VacA is essential for the immunosuppression of L. acidophilus-induced IFN-\u2424, we added bacterialfree supernatants (SN) from wild-type H. pylori 251 in various dilutions to BMDMs prestimulated with L. acidophilus (see Fig. S3A in the supplemental material). Our finding was confirmed, since the VacA-containing supernatant from wild-type H. pylori 251 strongly inhibited the IFN-\u2424 response induced by L. acidophilus. In contrast, bacterial-free supernatant from the H. pylori 251 vacA mutant was not capable of suppressing IFN-\u2424 produced by L. acidophilus-stimulated macrophages (see Fig. S3B ).\n\nIn epithelial cells, VacA is known to disrupt vesicular trafficking due to formation of anion-selective channels in the membranes of late endocytic compartments (33) . We therefore sought to determine whether a similar mechanism is employed in mac- rophages and whether phagosomal processing of L. acidophilus is necessary for the induction of IFN-\u2424. BMDMs were preincubated for 30 min with the endosomal acidification blockers chloroquine and bafilomycin A1 prior to stimulation with L. acidophilus (Fig. 3D) . Viability of the cells was verified via trypan blue staining (data not shown). Both inhibitors completely blocked the release of IFN-\u2424, indicating that phagosomal maturation and processing of L. acidophilus are required for the production of IFN-\u2424 (*, P \u03fd 0.01).\n\nH. pylori redirects the endocytic pathway of L. acidophilus. Since our previous experiment revealed that phagosomal processing of L. acidophilus is required to trigger the release of IFN-\u2424 in macrophages, we hypothesized that H. pylori redirects the intracellular processing and degradation of L. acidophilus. To determine the intracellular location of H. pylori and L. acidophilus, we applied deconvolution microscopy and analyzed the uptake of the bacteria with the early endosome marker EEA1 (34) and the late endosome and lysosome marker LAMP-1 (35) . Since we have shown that H. pylori is able to block the induction of Ifn-\u2424 at a very early stage (Fig. 2B) , we added L. acidophilus NCFM to BMDMs and analyzed the localization of the bacterium after 2 h. As can be observed in Fig. 4A , a large proportion of intracellular L. acidophilus bacteria did not colocalize with either EEA1 or LAMP-1 compartments. Indeed, we determined that after 2 h of incubation, approximately only 7% and 30% of intracellular L. acidophilus NCFM were contained within endosomal and lysosomal compartments, respectively (Fig. 4C) . The remainder of bacteria were not associated with either marker (*, P \u03fd 0.05; **, P \u03fd 0.01). In contrast, we detected the formation of megasomes and a significant increase in L. acidophilus colocalized in the endosomal and lysosomal compartments (19% and 50%, respectively, after 2 h incubation) when H. pylori was added, compared to results for BMDMs that were stimulated with L. acidophilus alone ( Fig. 4B and C). Figure 4D presents a magnified image of L. acidophilus localized in lysosomes (white arrow) in either the presence or absence of H. pylori. Our results indicate a greater release of L. acidophilus from the phagocytic compartments in the absence of H. pylori. We suggest that the addition of H. pylori leads to an accumulation of L. acidophilus in the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, thereby preventing the induction of IFN-\u2424 by L. acidophilus.\n\nIn the present work, we aimed to investigate whether L. acidophilus is able to modulate the inflammatory response induced by H. pylori in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) by examining the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in uptake and processing of these organisms. Whole-genome microarray analysis revealed that while L. acidophilus induces T-cell recruiting chemokines (Cxcl10 and Cxcl11), proinflammatory (IL-1\u2424 and IL-6), and Th1-skewing cytokines (IFN-\u2424 and IL-12), H. pylori predominantly induced cytokines indicative of innate immune responses (IL-1\u2424 and IL-1\u2423) and neutrophil-recruiting chemokines (Cxcl1, Cxcl2, and Cxcl3). Most importantly, microarray analysis revealed that when H. pylori is added to BMDMs prestimulated with L. acidophilus, Th1-skewing cytokines induced by L. acidophilus are strongly inhibited. Real-time PCR confirmed that H. pylori blocks the gene expression of IFN-\u2424, IL-12, Cxcl10, and TNF-\u2423, while it has an additive effect on the cytokine IL-1\u2424. Thus, our results show that H. pylori prevents the production of factors induced by L. acidophilus in macrophages that contribute to initiating the adaptive immune response.\n\nInterestingly, our microarray analysis also revealed that addition of H. pylori to macrophages prestimulated with L. acidophilus had a major impact on regulators of cytoskeletal arrangements and actin filament depolarization, since the genes encoding Pdrx2 and Pdxp were strongly induced upon incubation with both bacteria. In contrast, the genes Rgs1/2, Fgd2, and Dock8, regulators of the Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 GTPases, which are molecular switches controlling the organization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton, were strongly suppressed. It is well established that many bacterial pathogens regulate host trafficking pathways by the selective inclusion or retention of GTPases in host cells during infection and use these important cellular regulators as part of their overall virulence strategy (36, 37) . Thus, our data suggest that H. pylori modifies GTPases in macrophages to promote bacterial persistence in the host.\n\nExpression of constitutively active Rac1, a member of the Rho family of small GTPases, potentiates the activity of the H. pylori VacA toxin in two different epithelial cell lines (SCC12F keratinocytes and MDCK cells) (32) . Furthermore, pinocytosis of VacA is regulated by the Cdc42 GTPase in HeLa and gastric AGS cells (31) . Hence, we postulated that the same mechanism may be utilized in macrophages and that the H. pylori VacA toxin is involved in the immune-inhibitory effect observed. Indeed, the addition of H. pylori vacA mutant and VacA-containing supernatant from wildtype H. pylori 251 to L. acidophilus-stimulated BMDMs showed that VacA is essential for the inhibition of IFN-\u2424 responses.\n\nUpon internalization in macrophages, H. pylori induces the fusion of the individual phagosomes, resembling giant multivesicular bodies (13) , an effect that we observed in our microscopy (Fig. 4B ). Since VacA leads to cell vacuolation in the cell membranes of the late endosomal compartments in epithelial cells (33) , we used the endosomal acidification blockers chloroquine and bafilomycin A1 to determine whether phagosomal maturation and processing of L. acidophilus is required. Both inhibitors completely abrogated the expression of IFN-\u2424 in BMDMs stimulated with L. acidophilus, indicating that both phagocytic uptake and phagolysosomal maturation is a prerequisite for IFN-\u2424 signaling in response to this bacterium. Our microscopy data showed that H. pylori changes the endosomal transport of L. acidophilus from the endosomal and lysosomal compartments in BMDMs, suggesting that a specific endocytotic pathway is a key step for the induction of IFN-\u2424.\n\nThe immunosuppressive ability of H. pylori is further corroborated by our microarray data. We identified that Socs3, a negative regulator of cytokine signaling, was among the most strongly expressed genes in macrophages stimulated with H. pylori (see Table S2 in the supplemental material). Socs3 is upregulated by several viruses, e.g., herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) (38) , hepatitis virus C (HCV) (39), influenza A virus (40) , human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (41), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus (42) , and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (43, 44) , resulting in the inhibition of the type I interferon signaling pathway. Hence, the expression of Socs3 in macrophages stimulated with H. pylori might be an additional mechanism utilized by this pathogen to suppress cytokine signaling and thereby the activation of adaptive immunity.\n\nWe therefore suggest that the H. pylori VacA toxin causes a redirection of the endocytic pathway in macrophages that pre-vents the activation of adaptive immunity, exemplified by the Th1-skewing commensal L. acidophilus in our present study. Collectively, this suppression will limit the effectiveness of L. acidophilus NCFM as a probiotic during treatment of H. pylori-induced inflammation, symptoms, or eradication from the host. Although additional investigations are required to determine how L. acido-philus may encounter macrophages in vivo, it is plausible that this occurs during inflammatory states. Identification of the molecular mechanisms underlying VacA action will lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of H. pylori-associated diseases, as they are possible targets for the treatment of H. pylori infection and for vaccination. studies with coinfection, Dil-labeled L. acidophilus NCFM and unlabeled H. pylori 251 were added to the BMDMs prelabeled with LysoTracker green DND-26 (Molecular Probes, Life Technologies, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibody labeling with purified anti-H. pylori serum (in-house) was performed as described previously (45) . Cells were visualized by both confocal laser microscopy (Leica SP5) and wide-field deconvolution microscopy (Deltavision core system; Applied Precision, USA). Images are presented as a two-dimensional (2D) maximum-intensity projection or as single-plane images.\n\nStatistical analysis. The GraphPad Prism software program, version 4.03 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA), was used, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni tests were applied (P \u03fd 0.01). The microarray data were analyzed applying one-way ANOVA with Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction (P \u03fd 0.01). Colocalization studies were performed using the built-in feature in the Bitplane Imaris 7.5 software program with a threshold of background plus 2 standard deviations (SDs). Colocalization data were accumulated using the GraphPad Prism program as mentioned previously, and an unpaired t test was used to determine significance (*, P \u03fd 0.05; **, P \u03fd 0.01).\n\nMicroarray data accession number.
