In response to the situation, 53 unprecedented measures have been taken by central and local government to contain the outbreak 54 and prevent its further spread across China. On Jan 23 th , the Wuhan City Epidemic Prevention and 55 Control Headquarters announced that all urban buses, subways, ferries, and long-distance passenger 56 operations were suspended, and that the passages of airports and train stations were temporarily 57 closed 12 . Subsequently, major cities within Hubei province started to implement lockdown on Jan 26 th 58 or 27 th , 2020, except the remote Shennongjia Forestry District due to the very limited number of 59 COVID-19 cases. Unfortunately, around five million people had already left Wuhan by then since the 60 emergence of COVID-19 13, 14 . As the situation continued to deteriorate throughout China, the WHO 61 declared it as a global public health emergency on Jan 30 th 2020 15 .

The lag time between primary and secondary cases was identified by using the 104 displacement with the highest correlation from the cross-correlation result. The daily inflow index of certain provinces and cities was calculated by multiplying the daily outflow 108 index within Hubei and the corresponding proportion. We defined the total inflow index as the sum 109 of daily inflow index from Jan 10 th to 26 th , 2020. We used principal components analysis to reduce 110 the dimensionality of five initial parameters of medical resources, and to further obtain the synthetic 111 score of these parameters 19 . Factor loadings for concordance and overall satisfaction were low and 112 thus were removed. Table 2 shows 4 item factor loadings for the final two-factor solution, which 113 explained 96% of the variance. Medical resource scores equal to comp1*proportion1 plus 114 comp2*proportion2 (Table S2) .\n\nThe correlations between the number of total confirmed or primary cases and total inflow index at 116 provincial or city scale, between the medical resources score and fatality or cure rates, and between 117 the employees in centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) per capita and the confirmed cases 118 or the incidence of COVID-19 were analyzed using Spearman's correlation analysis. Cross-119 correlation of primary and secondary cases was calculated by Pearson's correlation analysis. Principal 120 components analysis was performed on Stata 14.0, and other data were analyzed using Prism 121 GraphPad 8.0. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.\n\nAs of Feb 19 th , 2020, a total of 74,675 confirmed COVID-19 cases had been reported in China, with 126 83.1% (62,031) being in Hubei province (Fig. 1A) . The cumulative number of confirmed cases was 127 below 1,000 before Jan 23 rd , 2020, and increased by almost ten-fold by Jan 30 th , 2020. There was a 128 further three-fold increase in the number of confirmed cases by Feb 6 th , 2020, which continues to 129 grow until now, but at much slow pace. In Hubei province the number of daily confirmed cases 130 reached peak on Feb 4 th , 2020 (Fig. 1B) , while in other regions, it reached a plateau on Jan 30 th , 2020, 131 .

There was irregularity in the reported daily number of deaths over time, with a sudden 135 rise on Feb 12 th , 2020, coinciding with change of diagnostic criteria (Fig. 1D ). The daily number of 136 cured cases has continuously increased both in Hubei province and in other parts of China (Fig. 1E ).\n\nFollowing the first confirmed COVID-19 case outside of China in Thailand, as of Feb 19 th , 2020, a 138 total of 924 cases have been reported worldwide excluding China (Fig. 1F) . However, the daily 139 cumulative confirmed cases worldwide excluding China grew slowly (Fig. 1G ). Overall, the ratio of secondary to primary cases (S/P ratio), a simple index for measuring the growth 157 of an epidemic, varied greatly across different provincial areas (Fig. 3A) , with Heilongjiang (10.7) 158 and Hong Kong (5.5) being the highest, and Tibet (0) and Qinghai (0.2) being the lowest. However, 159 there was little correlation between total number of confirmed cases and S/P ratio. For example, 160 .

We found although daily growth rate varied among different provincial 163 areas, some of them had common characteristics (Fig. 3B) . Based on the daily growth rate of 164 secondary cases we further divided study regions into three categories. In the first group the maximum 165 values for daily growth rates were all <1.5, including Beijing, Guangdong, and Chongqing (Fig. 3C) . 166 Second category of provinces/cities (eg, Sichuan, Hebei, and Zhejiang) showed much higher growth 167 rate in the first few days, from Jan 26 th to 30 th , 2020, followed by a downward trend until reaching 168 that of the first category (Fig. 3D ). In the last category (eg, Heilongjiang and Tianjin) the daily growth 169 rate showed a sustained and rapid rise, especially during the 5 days after Jan 30 th , 2020 (Fig. 3E ). 170 We further examined the lag time, or displacement, between primary and secondary cases by area, CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Indeed, as the medical service started to improve gradually and large number 250 of cases were properly diagnosed the case fatality rates had started to decreased steadily over the last 251 two weeks. Outside of Hubei, although the case fatality rates were very low, we also found a 252 significant correlation between health scores and overall prognosis of patients. In recognizing the 253 burden of epidemic in Hubei province and need for providing prompt and adequate medical service 254 to those infected, the Chinese government has created a \"province to city\" support system, in which 255 each city in Hubei province received direct and targeted support from at least one appointed province.
