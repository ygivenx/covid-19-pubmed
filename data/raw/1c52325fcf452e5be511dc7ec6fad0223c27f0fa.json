{"title": "Construction and application of carbohydrate microarrays to detect foodborne bacteria", "body": "Gram-negative bacteria can cause various types of infections to humans. The main concern is the increasing multidrug resistant strains of many species, including Escherichia coli (E.coli) and Salmonella [1] [2] [3] [4] which are common causes of foodborne disease. Recently, diseases caused by foodborne pathogens have drawn more attention with high morbidity and mortality rates, high costs and threats to public health [5] . Although there are many approaches to reduce the pathogen-ic microorganisms in food, detection of pathogenic bacteria remains the key to prevent the outbreaks [6] [7] . The conventional culture-dependent screen-out methods are often time-consuming and laborious [8] . In past decades, many technologies have been developed to achieve rapid and simple detection, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunological detection [9] [10] [11] [12] .\n\nCarbohydrates are abundant in living organisms and their specific interactions with proteins play a vital role in a variety of biological recognition processes to enable cell adhesion and communication, fertilization, differentiation, development and metastasis of tumor cell [13] [14] [15] . Pathogenic bacteria and viruses are found to attach to the glycans on the surface of host cells that are often the targets of bacterial toxins [16] through the carbohydrate-protein interactions and then present pathogenic properties [13] [14] [15] .\n\nMany conventional approaches such as isothermal titration calorimetry [17] [18] , surface plasmon resonance biosensing [19] [20] and affinity capillary electrophoresis [21] have been limited for the use in studies of the carbohydrate-protein interactions by the low amount of available carbohydrates.\n\nWith the successful development of DNA and protein microarrays, carbohydrate microarrays are emerging as a key method for rapid and high-throughput protein analysis requiring only very small amounts of carbohydrates [22] [23] . The carbohydrate-coated microarrays have been reported to be applied in study of the interactions of carbohydrate-bacteria and showed great potential for pathogens detection [24] [25] . Since there are complex components in food samples that causing severe interferences with antibody binding or nucleids detection processes, carbohydrate microarrays can capture target bacteria throughout the carbohydrate-protein interaction. FimH protein, on the tip of the fimbriae shaft, is a lectin-like adhesin responsible for the adhesion of type 1 fimbriae of enterobacteria with host cells by the specific binding to Dmannose residues [26] . It has showed that E.coli and Salmonella strains can both be detected with mannose-coated microarrays [24, [27] [28] .\n\nIn order to optimize the detection of bacteria, different linkers between surface and carbohydrates have been prepared to the determine the appropriate distance for the bacteria-glycan binding. Also, different types of glycan immobilization through chemical approaches have been tested for presenting the carbohydrates on the surface in a suitable three-dimensional manner. The optimized carbohydrate microarray has been applied for test of Salmonella enterica and E.coli and isolates from infected patients.The results showed that most isolates can be tested significantly, while some isolates showed weak fluorescence mostly due to weak binding affinities of their FimH variants towards the immobilized mannosides.\n\nThe slides were rinsed three times with distilled water and three times with 95% ethanol, dried by centrifugation. Subsequently, the slides were immersed in piranha solution for 2 h at 70 \u00baC, and washed three times with ethanol.\n\nThe thiol (SH) slides were immersed in anhydrous ethanol containing 3-mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane and acetic acid. The slides were incubated in this solution for 12 h at 40 \u00baC, washed three times with ethanol, and stored in a vacuum dessicator until use.\n\nThe NHS slides were immersed in anhydrous ethanol containing 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane and acetic acid. The slides were incubated in this solution for 6 h at 40 \u00baC, washed three times with ethanol, and vacuum drying for 2 h. Then the slides were immersed in anhydrous DMF containing tetraethylene glycol disuccinimidyl disuccinate (TGDD) and diisopropylamine. The slides were incubated for 12 h at 40 \u00baC, washed three times with ethanol, and stored in vacuum desiccator until use.\n\nThe functionalized slides were detected with fluorescein staining for quality control. The functionalized slides were randomly chosen and printed with FITC solved in DMSO (1 mg\u00b7mL \u22121 ) and vacuum dried at 80 \u00baC for 1 h. The slides were scanned with fluorescent slide reader to give fluorescent density referred as F1. The slides were then washed with SSC (2 \u00d7 ) buffer and 1% SDS for 5 min, respectively and then dried by centrifugation. The slides were scanned again to give F2. The slides were functionalized successfully when F2/F1 > 0.5.\n\nThe mannoses probes dissolved in PBS containing 30% glycerol were printed in predetermined places on glass slide with a distance of 971 \u03bcm between the center of adjacent spots (spot size, ca. 200 \u03bcm, calc. automatically by the system) by using Arrayjet microarray systems. Prints were performed in a humid chamber at 20 \u00baC.\n\nAfter printing, the SH slides were immediately placed in a humid chamber at 26 \u00baC for 12 h and then the unreacted thiols were capped by immersing them into a solution of PBS buffer (pH 6.8) that contained 1% N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) for 15 min with gentle shaking. The slides were then washed with PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h followed by wash of deionized water and then dried by centrifugation. Subsequently, the slides were incubated with buffer that contained 0.1% Tween 20 and 1% BSA for 1 h and then the slides were washed with the same buffer without BSA.\n\nAfter printing, the NHS slides was placed in a humid chamber at 26 \u00baC for 12 h and then vacuum drying in vacuum drying oven. The slides were then washed with PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then rinsed with PBS (pH 7.4). Subsequently, the slides were incubated with buffer that contained 0.1%Tween 20 and 1% BSA for 1 h and then washed with PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and rinsed with PBS (pH 7.4), and then dried.\n\nBacterial strains Salmonella ATCC31685 and ATCC9184 were purchased from ATCC cell lines. E.coli K-12 and BL-21 were kindly provided by Prof. Dr. RAO Yi-Jian from Jiangnan University.\n\nE.coli and Salmonella strains isolated from local patients were provided by the Wuxi CDC laboratory. The experiments involving these Salmonella and E. coli strains were performed in a Biosafety Level 2 Laboratory. All the procedures involving the manipulation of potentially infectious materials or cultures and the ultimate disposal were performed according to the safe handling and containment of infectious microorganism's regulations.\n\nAll cultures were grown in LB media at 37 \u00baC with shaking or on LB plate at 37 \u00baC till the final solution with an OD 660 of 1.0 (10 8 cells/mL).\n\nThe staining and hybridization was modified according to the following procedure. Aliquots of the bacterial cultures were washed twice with an equal volume of PBS buffer (pH 7.4) and then were fluorescently stained with SYTO 63 red fluorescent nucleic acid stain. Dye was added to 1 mL of bacteria suspension at a concentration of 50 nmol\u00b7L \u22121 in PBS buffer and shaken for 1 h. After incubation, the bacteria sus-pension was washed twice with 2 mL PBS buffer.\n\nEach array was equipped with a hybridization chamber, and then bacteria in PBS buffer that contained 1 mmol\u00b7L \u22121 CaCl 2 and 1 mmol\u00b7L \u22121 MnCl 2 was applied to the surface. The arrays were gently shaken on a platform for 1 h at 27 \u00baC in an 2 or 8 arrays SureHyb hybridization chamber (Agilent, USA) using the Agilent Microarray hybridization oven. After incubation, the hybridization chamber was removed, and unbound bacteria were washed away from the array twice with a solution of the PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then the slides were rinsed with PBS (pH 7.4). A final wash with pure water was used to remove salts from the array. Slides were then briefly centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min to dry the arrays. The arrays were then scanned using a fluorescent slide reader.\n\nThe glycan ligands can be immobilized on the surface through the various chemical approaches, resulting in their unique spatial arrangement, which is essential for successful fabrication of carbohydrate chips. It has been reported that mannose with ethanolamine linker spotted onto glass slides with the amine-reactive linker can be well used for detect E.coli strains [24] . Similarly, we have found that mannose with ethanolamine linker exhibited stronger binding affinity to Salmonella strains than mannose with aromatic amine linker by microarray, although mannosides with an aromatic aglycon have been reported to bind with FimH protein in a better manner and thus be significant inhibitors of Type 1 fimbriaemediated bacterial adhesion [27, [29] [30] The linker containing phenyl structure may have lower rigidity and thus change the spatial arrangement of the glycan ligands on the surface. In order to test the detection performance, we prepared mannose and aliphatic chain linkers with different lengths and activated the glass slides into N-hydroxy-succinamide-coated glass slides (NHS slides) and thiol-coated glass slides (SH slides) to construct carbohydrate arrays (Fig. 1) . The glass slides (7.5 cm \u00d7 2.5 cm) were activated and fabricated according to previous reports [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] .\n\nTo test the specificity, response sensitivity and performance of the arrays, two Salmonella enterica strains (S. gal-linarum, ATCC9184 and S. abortusovis, ATCC31685) and two E.coli strains (E.coli K-12 and E.coli BL-21) were used, among which S. abortusovis ATCC316865 and E.coli K-12 have strong attach ability to mannose derivatives on eukaryotic cells surface, while S.gallinarum ATCC9184 and E.coli BL-21 are not mannose-sensitive due to the deficiency of the FimH protein [36] .\n\nThe slides were hybridized with bacteria cells stained with SYTO TM 63 Red fluorescent nucleic acid stain, washed and scanned according to modified procedure [25, 35, 37] . All the slides were first hybridized with 10 8 Salmonella and E. coli bacteria cells and results (Fig. 2) show that the microspots that contained a little longer linker (Man-H) exhibited a little higher fluorescence intensities than that with shorter linker (Man-E) on NHS slides with both ATCC316865 and K-12 strains. The NHS slides showed weak binding affinity for E. coli strains.\n\nMannosides (Man-E and Man-H) were also probed on thiol-activated slides (SH slides) with different linkers (L1-L3) to further test the effect of linker length on the detection performance. Interestingly, Fig. 3A and B show that the fluorescence intensities of the microspots are related to the length of linkers between glycans and the glass surface.\n\nThe results show the microspots of Man-E/L3 on SH-reactive slides exhibited strongest fluorescent signals. However, the microspots probed with Man-H/L2 on SH slides showed the stronger signals than those with Man-H-L1 and Man-H-L3. Since the linker length of Man-E on NHS slides, Man-E-L3, Man-H-L2 on SH slides are roughly similar, it seemed that the binding efficiency of bacteria cells with the glycans are positively correlated with the linkers length within a certain range. The binding between the immobilized mannose and FimH protein may be interfered when the linker is too long, which could result unsuitable stereo-direction of the glycans on the glass slides surface. An efficient immobilization of carbohydrates on the surface is essential for successful fabrication of carbohydrate chips. Comparing with NHS slides, the mannosides can be more efficiently immobilized onto the slides by the coupling of thiol group and maleimide group through the click chemistry reaction, which then showed relatively better performance.\n\nThus, we chose Man-E-L3 probed SH slides for further bacteria detection. The effect of immobilized mannosides amount for detection was also determined. The results show that Man-E-L3 can be probed in a less amount on SH slides to present stronger fluorescent intensities, which are consistent with the above binding tendencies. Since the results showed that the immobilization of 30 mmol\u00b7L It shows the similar sensitivity as previous report of the detection of E. coli strains [24] , which needs a bacterial enrichment step prior to detection. In order to test whether the bacteria strains can be detected by this mannose microarray, over 10 7 cells were utilized in the following tests for good detection effect. This detection limit may be improved by immobilization of multivalent glyco-macroligands, such as glycodendrimers [38] [39] , glycopolymers [40] [41] , glycoliposomes [42] [43] , and glyconanoparticles [23, 44] to well control the multivalence, density and orientation of the mannosides on the surface. We then first tested the binding of several Salmonella strains isolated from local patients on this Man-E-L3/SH microarray, including 12 Salmonella isolates in 8 seratypes, such as S. Thomson, S. Enteritidis, S. London, S. Allerton, etc, which are all commonly detected as foodborne bacteria in food market [45] .\n\nIt is found that most Salmonella isolates can be detected ([S/N] > 5) with the carbohydrate microarray and 9 isolates presented very strong binding affinity ([S/N] >= 10, Table 1 ).\n\nIt is found this carbohydrate microarray presented positive binding results for 8 Salmonella isolates (Table 1) . Interestingly, the binding affinities of Salmonella varied with the serotypes. Especially, S. London, S. Allerton and S. Senftenberg isolates can be detected by the microarray effectively. The weak binding of other serovars with this mannose microarray ([S/N] <= 5) are probably due to the low binding affinity between the Salmonella serovar and monomannose residue on the surface, for example, FimH adhesin of Salmonella serovar Typhimurium bind strongly to high-mannose oligosaccharides [46] Furthermore, the isolates of the same Salmonella serovar exhibited different binding affinity with the microarray, since the same serovar also contain high-and low-adhesive allelic variants of FimH adhesin, such as S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis [47] .\n\nWe further tested 9 diarrheagenic E. coli isolates from diarrheal patients in 4 categories including enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), which commonly cause intestinal disease and can be detected from foods [48] ( Table 2) . Although it was reported that FimH alleles of many uropathogenic E. coli exhibit higher affinity for monomannose than most intestinal commensal isolates, the results showed positive results of 7 E. coli isolates and very strong binding affinities of 5 isolates to the mi- croarray indicating great potential for the detection. Recent research revealed that the functional differences between allelic variants of Salmonella bacterial proteins, specifically FimH adhesin, contribute to host-specific adherence [47] which may result in the different binding pattern to mannose residues on the glass surface. It suggested that combination of different glycan constructions may be more helpful to detect bacteria in diverse serovars or subtypes with different binding properties through carbohydrate microarray.\n\nIn summary, we have developed carbohydrate microarray using linkers of suitable length and immobilization method for the food borne bacteria detection. We tested this microarray with 12 Salmonella isolates and 9 diarrheagenic E. coli isolates from patients for the first time and showed strong binding with several seravars and subtypes, demonstrating that microarrays are a powerful platform to probe the carbohydrate-pathogen interactions. The results also implied that the microarray with single glycan construction is not enough for the detection of bacteria with various serovars or subtypes, which contain a high degree of allelic variation in adhesin.\n\nFuture work will be focused on the microarray with combination of several suitable constructions of glycan residues to accommodate their binding with diverse host-associated adhesin alleles inspired by the function-structure relationship studies of bacteria protein allelic variations with host specificity. Furthermore, the binding pattern of bacteria with different glycan ligands may be useful for the analysis of the association of binding features with the bacteria species and serotypes. "}
