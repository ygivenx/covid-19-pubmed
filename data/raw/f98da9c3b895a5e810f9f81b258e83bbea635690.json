{"title": "APOBEC3G cytidine deaminase association with coronavirus nucleocapsid protein", "body": "Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G) is a member of the APOBEC3 family of cytidine deaminases (Cullen, 2006) . Human APOBEC3G (hA3G) can be packaged into HIV-1 virions to mediate C-to-U editing on nascent proviral minus strands during reverse transcription, resulting in the inhibition of viral replication Mangeat et al., 2003; Yu et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2003) . Accordingly, hA3G as an anti-viral factor confers innate immunity to HIV-1. However, HIV-1 encodes Vif, which counteracts hA3G by inducing hA3G degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, thereby blocking its incorporation into budding virions (Mehle et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2003) . The ability of Vif to negate hA3G function is both dependent on physical association and partly species-specific-in other words, Vif cannot counteract a form of A3G from a different species. This inefficient Vif-hA3G interaction means that HIV-1 Vif is capable of counteracting human and chimpanzee A3G, but not mouse A3G (mA3G) or African green monkey A3G (Mariani et al., 2003) . Other researchers have shown that hA3G or other APOBEC family members can confer innate immunity to a wide range of retroviruses as well as HBV (which is similar to retroviruses in that it also goes through a reverse transcription step during genomic replication) (Cullen, 2006) .\n\nThe incorporation of A3G into HIV-1 virions is mediated by the Gag nucleocapsid (NC) domain (Alce and Popik, 2004; Cen et al., 2004; Khan et al., 2005; Luo et al., 2004; Schafer et al., 2004; Zennou et al., 2004) . In addition to playing a key role in viral RNA packaging (Berkowitz et al., 1993 (Berkowitz et al., , 1995 Poon et al., 1996; Zhang and Barklis, 1997) , NC contains an I domain that is responsible for Gag-Gag interactions (Bennett et al., 1993; Bowzard et al., 1998) . Heterologous polypeptides capable of self-association have been shown to confer the ability to efficiently produce chimeric VLPs when substituted for HIV-1 NC (Accola et al., 2000; Burniston et al., 1999; Johnson et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 1998) . However, replacing NC with a leucine-zipper motif that does not encapsidate RNA abolishes hA3G packaging without significantly affecting HIV-1 virion production (Zennou et al., 2004) , suggesting RNA involvement in hA3G incorporation. This is consistent with the proposal that RNA is required for either hA3G viral incorporation or Gag-hA3G interaction (Khan et al., 2005; Schafer et al., 2004; Svarovskaia et al., 2004; Zennou et al., 2004) . We previously demonstrated that HIV-1 Gag mutants containing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nucleocapsid (SARS-CoV N) coding sequences as NC substitutes can effectively assemble VLPs . While completely unrelated, the SARS-CoV N protein is similar to HIV-1 NC in that it contains putative protein-protein interaction domains (He et al., 2004; Narayanan et al., 2003; Surjit et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2005) and plays a role in viral RNA packaging (Hsieh et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2004a) .\n\nGiven that SARS-CoV N possesses a RNA-binding property, it is likely that assembly-competent chimeras containing a replacement of HIV-1 NC by an SARS-CoV N sequence may support the incorporation of hA3G into VLPs. Here we demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal half of the SARS-CoV or human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) N protein not only enables efficient VLP production, but also confers the ability to efficiently package human APOBEC3G (hA3G) when substituted for HIV-1 NC. Direct evidence comes in the form of hA3G being efficiently packaged into SARS-CoV VLPs. The interaction between coronavirus N and hA3G is also RNAdependent. This implies that in addition to retroviruses, SARS-CoV and other RNA viruses may be capable of packaging hA3G via nucleocapsid domains.\n\nWe previously reported that the HIV-1 Gag chimeras containing the SARS-CoV N carboxyl-terminal 215-421 [NC(N2)] or 234-421 [NC (N4)] codons in the deleted NC region (Fig. 1) are capable of assembling VLPs as efficiently as wt Gag . This raises the question of whether the inserted SARS-CoV N sequence confers the chimeric ability to package hA3G. We therefore coexpressed assembly-competent NC(N2) and NC(N4) with hA3G in 293T cells and used Western immunoblotting to detect VLPassociated hA3G. Our controls were the HIV-1 NC-deleted mutants \u0394NC, \u0394PC, and delNC, all with different numbers of deleted NC codons ( Fig. 1) . Our results show that NC(N2) and NC(N4) were capable of packaging hA3G at the same efficiency level as the wild-type ( Fig. 2A , lanes 6 and 7 vs. lane 2). Low but detectable VLP-associated hA3G was observed in the NC-deletion mutants (lanes 4 and 5). Since HIV-1 Vif inhibits hA3G virion incorporation by triggering hA3G degradation (Conticello et al., 2003; Kao et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2004; Mariani et al., 2003; Marin et al., 2003; Mehle et al., 2004; Sheehy et al., 2003; Stopak et al., 2003; Yu et al., 2003) , the hA3G expression level or the presence of Vif may affect the level of virus-associated hA3G. To test whether Vif or hA3G expression level affects hA3G packaging into chimeric VLPs, we introduced mutation-blocking Vif expression into wt and NC(N2) and co-transfected each Vif-deficient (\u0394Vif) result with different amounts of the hA3G-coding plasmid. In the absence of Vif, we observed a relatively higher steady-state hA3G expression level accompanied by an increased level of VLP-associated hA3G (Fig. 2B, right top panel) . Members of the \u0394Vif group occasionally expressed higher VLP levels than their Vif-intact counterparts (Fig. 2B, . However, we also repeatedly observed \u0394Vif group members producing higher levels of VLP-associated hA3G. In the presence or absence of Vif, NC(N2) displayed a level of VLPassociated hA3G comparable to that displayed by wt. These results suggest that the SARS-CoV N carboxyl-terminal region can be substituted for HIV-1 NC without affecting VLP assembly or hA3G packaging functions.\n\nTo determine the required SARS-CoV N sequences for conferring hA3G packaging ability, we co-expressed hA3G with wt or with chimeras containing a variety of N coding regions as HIV-1 NC substitutes. As illustrated in Fig. 1 , full-length SARS-CoV N sequences were inserted into the \u0394NC (\u0394NC [CoN] ) and delNC (NC[CoN]) constructs. NC(N1), NC(N3), NC(N5), NC(N6), and NC(N7) respectively contain N codons 2-213, 215-359, 302-421, 2-168, and 2-86 in the deleted NC region. We again found that both NC(N2) and NC(N4) were capable of efficiently packaging hA3G at VLP-associated hA3G levels comparable to or higher than those of wt (Fig. 2C, lanes 5 and 7) . Even though \u0394NC(CoN) and NC(CoN) were found to be defective in VLP production, they incorporated hA3G at an efficiency level comparable to that of wt (lanes 2 and 3). Further, despite producing substantial amounts of VLPs, the NC(N1) was incapable of packaging hA3G as efficiently as wt (i.e., it produced a VLP-associated hA3G level approximately 60% that of wt) (lane 4). The barely detectable level of VLP-associated hA3G found in NC(N6) may be due to lower levels of VLPs in the blot and/or lower levels of hA3G expression (Fig. 2C) . However, in a separate blot containing higher VLP and hA3G expression levels, VLP-associated hA3G in NC(N6) was approximately 50% that measured in wt (data not shown).\n\nBoth hA3G viral incorporation and Gag-hA3G interaction require the presence of RNA (Khan et al., 2005; Schafer et al., 2004; Svarovskaia et al., 2004; Zennou et al., 2004) . We tested whether the association between SARS-CoV N and hA3G has the same requirement by fusing the SARS-CoV N amino-terminal (N1, N6, and N7) or carboxyl-terminal sequence (N2, and N5) to the carboxyl terminus of GST and co-expressing each GST fusion construct with hA3G. Cell lysates containing hA3G and GST fusions were treated with RNase prior to performing a GST pull-down assay. Results indicate that GST-CoN, GST-N1, GST-N2, and GST-N6 were capable of pulling down hA3G, whereas the amount of hA3G associated with GST fusion was markedly reduced following RNase treatment (Fig. 3) . Neither GST-N5 nor GST-N7 was capable of pulling down hA3G, regardless of whether or not they were treated with RNase (Fig. 3, lanes 7, 9, 16 and 18 ). These results suggest that (a) the hA3G-binding domain of SARS-CoV N is largely contained within the sequence between residues 86 and 302, and (b) efficient N-hA3G interactions occur in a RNA-dependent manner. , nucleocapsid (NC), p6, and amino acid residues in SP1-NC-SP2 junction. \u0394NC has ten HIV-1 NC residues remaining in the deleted region; \u0394PC has NC almost deleted, with SP1 partially removed. delNC has the two methionine residues (bracketed) in the SP1-NC junction removed. PCR-amplified fragments containing various portions of SARS-CoV N coding sequences were inserted into the deleted NC regions. Numbers denote codon positions at inserted SARS-CoV N protein sequence boundaries. Arrows indicate SP1-NC and NC-SP2 junction sites. Remaining HIV-1 NC residues in deleted regions are underlined. Altered or foreign amino acid residues inserted in juncture area are italicized. All constructs were expressed in HIVgptD25 (a HIV-1 PR-defective expression vector).\n\nTo test whether hA3G can be efficiently packaged into SARS-CoV, we transfected 293T cells containing the hA3G-coding plasmid with SARS-CoV M and N expression vectors. SARS-CoV VLPs were generated by co-expressing M and N proteins (Huang et al., 2004b) . Results indicate that the amount of SARS-CoV VLP-associated hA3G was comparable to that of HIV-1 (Fig. 4A , lane 4 vs. lane 5). Medium hA3G\n\nwas not detected when co-expressed with M or N alone. Extracellular N was also undetectable without M co-expression (data not shown). Results from co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that N was capable of associating with hA3G but M was not (data not shown). The data suggest that hA3G packaging into SARS-CoV VLPs largely depends on hA3G-N association.\n\nTo further confirm an association between released hA3G and SARS-CoV VLPs formed by M and N, supernatant pellets derived from Incorporation of human APOBEC3G into VLPs. 293T cells were co-transfected with a human APOBEC3G (hA3G) expression vector and indicated plasmid. At 48-72 h posttransfection, cells and supernatant were collected and subjected to Western immunoblotting. hA3G plasmid DNA (2 or 8 \u03bcg) was used for co-transfection as indicated. \u0394Vif is a Vifdeficient mutation introduced into wt and NC(N2) (panel B, lanes 6-9). Wild-type Gag and chimeric proteins were probed with a monoclonal antibody directed against HIV-1 CA; an anti-HA monoclonal antibody was used to detect hA3G. Vif antiserum was used to detect Vif. Relative levels of VLP-associated hA3G are indicated along the bottom (panel C). hA3G, wt Gag, and chimeric proteins were quantified by scanning hA3G and p24CA-associated band densities from immunoblots. Ratios of hA3G to p24 gag were determined and normalized to that of wt. cells co-transfected with hA3G, M, and N expression vectors were subjected to sucrose density gradient fractionation experiments. The results shown in Fig. 4B indicate that both M and N had fraction 6 peaks at a density of 1.18 g/ml, which is consistent with a previous report on SARS-CoV virus-like particle density (Huang et al., 2004b) . A hA3G peak was also found at fraction 6, suggesting an association between hA3G and SARS-CoV VLPs generated via M and N coexpression.\n\nMembers of the APOBEC3 protein family share a highly conserved zinc-coordinating motif: His-X-Glu-X 23-28 -Pro-Cys-X 2-4 -Cys (Chen et al., 2007b) . Similar to APOBEC1, APOBEC3G contains two zinccoordinating motifs, with the carboxyl-terminal zinc-coordinating motif possessing catalytic cytidine deaminase activity. To identify hA3G regions responsible for hA3G incorporation into SARS-CoV VLPs, we co-transfected 293T cells with M and N expression vectors and a plasmid encoding wt or a hA3G mutant containing various carboxyl-or amino-terminus deletions (Fig. 5A) . The results indicate that hA3G mutants lacking residues 1-104, 157-384, or 246-384 were capable of being incorporated into VLPs, and that hA3G mutants lacking residues 1-156 or 309-384 were undetectable in the medium samples (Fig. 5B, lanes 4 and 7) . In the cases of \u0394246-384 and \u0394309-384, poor particle incorporation may be due in part to low expression levels. In particular, \u0394309-384 was barely detectable in repeat experiments. Low steady-state expression levels of the carboxylterminal truncated hA3G mutant have been reported previously (Cen et al., 2004) . In comparison, the \u0394157-384 mutant expressed greater steady-state stability and a higher level of VLP-associated hA3G (lanes 5 and 12). To test whether the mutations had similar effects on hA3G packaging into chimeric VLPs, wt or each hA3G mutant was individually co-expressed with NC(NC2) (which contains the carboxyl-terminal half of the N coding sequence and is known to efficiently produce VLPs and package hA3G) (Figs. 1 and 2). Our results indicate that the hA3G mutations exerted similar effects on hA3G packaging into NC(N2) VLPs with no detectable VLP-associated \u03941-156 or \u0394309-384 (Fig. 5C) .\n\nCombined, these results suggest that the essential region for hA3G packaging into SARS-CoV VLPs is located between residues 104 and 156, corresponding to the first linker region. To test whether the deletion mutations exerted similar effects on hA3G incorporation into HIV-1 VLPs, we co-expressed wt or each hA3G deletion mutant . Equal amounts of cell lysates were treated with (lanes 10-18) or without (lanes 1-9) 0.2 mg/ml DNase-free RNase A for 30 min at 25\u00b0C, followed by mixing with glutathione-agarose beads for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. Complexes bound to the beads were pelleted, washed, and subjected to Western immunoblotting with anti-HA and anti-GST antibodies. individually with HIV-1 Gag. In agreement with previous reports (Cen et al., 2004; Luo et al., 2004) , the \u03941-156 mutation (with a deletion involving the first linker region) blocked hA3G incorporation (Fig. 5D,  lane 4) . Overall, the deletion mutations had similar effects on hA3G packaging into HIV-1, NC(N2), and SARS-CoV VLPs. Specifically, the essential domain for incorporating hA3G into HIV-1 and SARS-CoV VLPs was located in the same (first) linker region.\n\nTo test whether the SARS-CoV N ability to confer hA3G packaging is dependent on N-hA3G interaction and therefore distinct from its selfinteraction capacity, we co-expressed hA3G with an assemblycompetent Gag containing a leucine-zipper domain as a NC substitute. Inserting a wild-type leucine-zipper (wtZiP) domain into the deleted NC region restored VLP production to wt level (Fig. 6A, lane 4) . A mutant leucine-zipper motif (KZiP) replacement was incapable of rescuing the \u0394NC assembly defect (Fig. 6A, lane 5) , but in spite of producing a wt-comparable level of VLPs, \u0394NC(wtZiP) did not package hA3G as efficiently as wt (lane 4 vs. lane 2).\n\nWe also examined whether human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) N protein (having approximately 30% homology with SARS-CoV N at the amino acid level) (Tswen-Kei Tang, 2005) is capable of conferring the ability to package hA3G when substituted for HIV-1 NC. To perform this test, we constructed NC(229EN2) (an NC[N2] counterpart) by inserting the HCoV-229E carboxyl-terminal half nucleocapsid coding sequence into the deleted HIV-1 NC region. The resulting construct was transiently co-expressed with hA3G in 293T cells. The results indicate that NC(229EN2) can also package hA3G to a degree comparable to that of wt when released VLPs are at a similar level (data not shown). To mitigate the impact of overexpressed hA3G on this conclusion, we repeated the experiment by co-expressing hA3G with wt or the chimeric construct in 293 cells. As the results in Fig. 6B indicate, the carboxyl-terminal half of HCoV-229E N (which also contains a putative self-association domain) (Tswen-Kei Tang, 2005) was capable of replacing the HIV-1 NC function with respect to VLP assembly and hA3G packaging-that is, substantial amounts of VLPs and hA3G were detected in NC(229EN2) transfectant supernatant (lane 4). To determine whether the interaction between hA3G and HCoV-229E N also requires RNA, we performed a GST pull-down assay in the presence or absence of RNase. As expected, the GST fusions containing the full-length (GST-229EN), amino-terminal half (GST-229EN1), or carboxyl-terminal half (GST-229EN2) of the HCoV-229E N sequence were capable of efficient hA3G pull-down, which is also dependent on the presence of RNA (Fig. 7) . These data suggest that HCoV-229E N and SARS-CoV N may share a propensity for hA3Gassociation. Open boxes indicate the zinccoordinating motif, HXE-X 23-28 -CX 2-4 C. The asterisk denotes the cytidine deaminase catalytic site. Domains that previously referred to the \"linker\" peptides are depicted by arrowheads. Numbers denote amino acid positions in hA3G. Indicated positions of deleted hA3G amino acid residue boundaries were used to designate mutant hA3G constructs. Note that each hA3G deletion mutant was tagged with a single copy of HA at the carboxyl terminus and that the wt hA3G was triple-tagged with HA. This may have caused a higher signal for the detected wt hA3G, thus leading to underestimates of the VLP-associated hA3G deletion mutants. (B-D) Incorporation of wt and mutant hA3G into VLPs. 293T cells were cotransfected with M and N, NC(N2) or an HIV-1 Gag expression vector (HIVgptD25) plus each of the hA3G expression vectors. To avoid effects from Vif on hA3G expression level, NC (N2) and HIVgptD25 were expressed in Vif-deficient (\u0394Vif) contexts. At 48-72 h post-transfection, supernatant and cells were harvested, prepared, and subjected to Western immunoblotting. M and N were probed with M antiserum and an anti-N monoclonal antibody. hA3G was probed with an anti-HA antibody and wt Gag and chimeric proteins were detected with an anti-p24CA antibody. Levels of p24CA-and N-associated proteins and virus-associated hA3G in each sample were quantified by scanning immunoblot band densities. Ratios of total hA3G versus p24CA-associated or N-associated protein levels were calculated for each sample and normalized to that of wt hA3G in parallel experiments. Dashes (-) denote ratios below 0.01. Similar results were observed in repeat and independent experiments. The immunoblots presented here were intentionally overexposed to allow for visualization of the individual hA3G mutants.\n\nAny conclusion that SARS-CoV N enables efficient hA3G packaging into VLPs when substituted for HIV-1 NC must be tempered when over-expression systems are considered. Still, the evidence presented in this paper suggests an association between SARS-CoV N and hA3Gthat is, the leucine-zipper domain is incapable of conferring the ability to package hA3G when substituted for HIV-1 NC even though it enables efficient VLP production. Moreover, assembly-competent chimeras with various SARS-CoV N protein sequences inserted into the deleted HIV-1 NC did not have equal hA3G packaging capabilities: NC(N2) and NC(N4) exhibited a higher level of VLP-associated hA3G than NC(N1). Results from a GST pull-down assay suggest that the SARS-CoV N domain associated with hA3G is largely contained within the central N region between residues 86 and 302 (Fig. 3) . Although GST-N1 and GST-N6 can pull down hA3G, we found that NC(N1) and NC(N6) are incapable of packaging hA3G as efficiently as wt or NC (N2). Therefore, insufficient hA3G incorporation into NC(N1) and NC (N6) may be due in part to steric hindrance in a chimeric protein context.\n\nEvidence that a carboxyl-terminal self-association domain of SARS-CoV N or HCoV-229E N (as opposed to the amino-terminal RNA-binding domain) confers the ability to efficiently package hA3G suggests that for this specific purpose, HIV-1 NC can be replaced by a protein sequence that does not encapsidate HIV-1 genomic RNA. Given the number of studies demonstrating that viral genomic RNA is dispensable for efficient A3G packaging (Alce and Popik, 2004; Cen et al., 2004; Khan et al., 2005; Luo et al., 2004; Navarro et al., 2005; Schafer et al., 2004; Svarovskaia et al., 2004; Zennou et al., 2004) , any genomic RNA packaging defect that does exist should not exert a significant impact on the hA3G package. The finding that efficient SARS-CoV N association with hA3G is RNA-dependent (Fig. 3) agrees with the proposal that RNA (viral or nonspecific) is required for mediating hA3G-Gag association and hA3G incorporation into virions (Svarovskaia et al., 2004; Zennou et al., 2004) . We assumed that the chimeras considered competent in hA3G packaging are capable of packaging considerable amounts of RNA, since the SARS-CoV N (Hsieh et al., 2005; Luo et al., 2006) and HIV-1 MA domains (Burniston et al., 1999; Ott et al., 2005) both possess nucleic acid binding properties that may confer RNA packaging ability. Using a RNA quantification assay as described by Chang et al. (2008) , we found that NC(N2) VLPs contain RNA at approximately 80% of the level measured in HIV-1 Gag VLPs (data not shown).\n\nRecent studies have suggested that hA3G preferentially binds with cellular 7SL RNA, which in turn facilitates an association between RNA-bound hA3G and NC for viral incorporation (Bogerd and Cullen, 2008; Wang et al., 2007) . Accordingly, 7SL RNA apparently plays a key role in determining hA3G packaging into HIV-1 virions. Additional experiments are required to determine whether SARS-CoV or NC(N2) are as capable as HIV-1 in terms of packaging 7SL RNA. To date, one in vitro study has demonstrated that A3G binds to RNA prior to HIV-1 NC association (Bogerd and Cullen, 2008) . Accordingly, it may be that the interactions required for A3G/RNA/NC ternary complex formation involve specific contacts between NC and both A3G and A3G-bound RNA. SARS-CoV N association with hA3G may in large part depend on N binding to hA3G-bound RNA, since the SARS-CoV N contains clusters of basic residues in the amino-and carboxyl-terminal regions that may confer RNA-binding ability (Hsieh et al., 2005) . Extensive genetic analyses indicate that SARS-CoV N RNA-binding domains are largely located between amino acid residues 45-181 (Huang et al., 2004a) , 248-280 (Chen et al., 2007a; Luo et al., 2006) , and 363-382 Equal amounts of cell lysates were treated with (lanes 6-10) or without (lanes 1-5) 0.2 mg/ml DNasefree RNase A, followed by GST pull-down assay as described in the legend of Fig. 3 . (Luo et al., 2006) , all of which contain large quantities of basic residues. It is conceivable that basic residue clusters within SARS-CoV N make a significant contribution to hA3G-N association by enhancing N binding to hA3G-associated RNA. Compatible with this hypothesis, we found that the GST fusions GST-CoN, GST-N1, GST-N2 and GST-N6, all of which contain most of the residues involved in RNA-binding, are competent in their associations with hA3G (Fig. 3) . The exception to this rule is GST-N5, which is unable to pull down hA3G despite bearing a putative RNA-binding domain (residues 363-382). Our finding that the essential region for hA3G packaging into HIV-1 or SARS-CoV VLPs resides between codons 104 and 156 is compatible with a genetic analysis demonstrating that residues 124 to 127 are responsible for hA3G viral incorporation (Huthoff and Malim, 2007) .\n\nA very recent study suggests that hA3G contains a necessary and sufficient cytoplasmic retention signal located between residues 113 and 128 (Bennett et al., 2008) . Consistent with this report, our immunofluorescence experiment results indicate that cells expressing the hA3G deletion mutant \u03941-156 show fluorescence staining in both the nucleus and cytoplasm; in contrast, fluorescence in cells expressing wt or hA3G mutants \u03941-104, \u0394157-384, or \u0394246-384 is predominantly present in cell cytoplasm (data not shown). However, the mislocalization of \u03941-156 does not account for its defective incorporation into HIV-1 or SARS-CoV VLPs, since GST pull-down assay results suggest that cytoplasmic hA3G(\u03941-156) is still incapable of associating with SARS-CoV N (data not shown).\n\nHCoV-229E N and SARS-CoV N share two conserved sequences: one from residues 50 to 170 and the other from 250 to 360 (Tswen-Kei Tang, 2005) . Combined, the ability of NC(229EN2) to package hA3G and the RNA-dependent association of HCoV-229E N with hA3G ( Fig. 7) imply that in addition to SARS-CoV N, coronaviral N products may associate with hA3G via binding with RNA. However, human Tcell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) has been found to prevent hA3G packaging through Gag NC domain action (Derse et al., 2007) , suggesting that some RNA viruses are incapable of packaging A3G.\n\nOur results indicate that the presence of the hA3G first linker region is required for hA3G to be packaged into either HIV-1 Gag or SARS-CoV VLPs. It is possible that an RNA/hA3G complex, either alone or in combination with other cellular factors, is an acceptable structure for an association between HIV-1 NC and SARS-CoV N.\n\nHere we demonstrated for the first time that SARS-CoV is capable of packaging hA3G via the SARS-CoV N protein. It remains to be determined whether chimeric NC(N2) or SARS-CoV can package endogenous A3G as efficiently as HIV-1. The biological significance of a SARS-CoV N association with hA3G also requires further exploration. According to one report, hA3G is capable of editing virus-associated HIV-1 RNA (Bishop et al., 2004) ; the hA3G-mediated inhibition of viral replication may be independent of its cytidine deaminase activity (R\u00f6sler et al., 2005; Turelli et al., 2004) . Since humans are not natural hosts for SARS-CoV , human susceptibility implies that cells infected by SARS-CoV may not express A3G, or SARS-CoV may have evolved to counteract A3G anti-viral activity. Further studies are required to address this issue.\n\nThe parental HIV-1 proviral plasmid DNA used in this study was HXB 2 (Ratner et al., 1985) . The cDNA clone of the SARS-CoV N (SARS coronavirus strain TWC, GenBank accession number AY321118) was provided by the Centers for Disease Control of the Department of Health, Taiwan. HIV-1 NC-deletion mutants \u0394NC, delNC, and \u0394PC and chimeras \u0394NC(CoN), NC(CoN), NC(N1), NC(N2), NC(N3), NC(N4), NC (N5), NC(N6), NC(N7), \u0394NC(wtZiP) and \u0394NC(KZiP) were all as previously described . Primers used for making NC(229EN2) were 5\u2032-CGCAATCGATTCATGAAGGCAGTTGCT-3\u2032 (for-ward) and 5\u2032-CTTCGGATCCCGTTTACTTCATCAAT-3\u2032 (reverse) using a coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) nucleocapsid expression vector pTRE-HN (Schelle et al., 2005) as template (kindly provided by Volker Thiel). To construct a Vif-deficient (\u0394Vif) mutation, Vif-encoding plasmid DNA was digested with NdeI, filled in, and relegated, resulting in a shift in the Vif open reading frame. All of the engineered constructs were cloned into the PR-defective HIV-1 proviral expression vector HIVgptD25 (Wang et al., 2000) . Human APOBEC3G (hA3G) expression vector pcDNA3.1-APOBEC3G-HA (Sheehy et al., 2002; Stopak et al., 2003) was obtained through the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. hA3G deletion mutants were gifts from S. Cen (Cen et al., 2004) . Mammalian expression vectors encoding SARS-CoV M and N were provided by G.J. Nabel (Huang et al., 2004b) .\n\nTo construct GST fusions, amplicons containing SARS-CoV N or HCoV-229E N coding sequences were digested with BamHI and ClaI and fused to the C-terminus of GST, which is directed by a mammalian elongation factor 1a promoter (Cortes et al., 1996) . Primers for cloning GST fusions were GST-CoN, 5\u2032-TAAAGGATCCTCTGATAATGGACCC-3\u2032 (forward), 5\u2032-TCATATCGATTTATGCCTGAGTTGAATC-3\u2032 (reverse); GST-N1, 5\u2032-TAAAGGATCCTCTGATAATGGACCC-3\u2032 (forward), 5\u2032-GCTCAT-CGATTAGCTAGCCATTCGAGC-3\u2032 (reverse); GST-N2, 5\u2032-TGGCTGGAT-CCGGTGGTGAAACTGCC-3\u2032 (forward), 5\u2032-TCATATCGATTTATGCCT-GAGTTGAATC-3\u2032 (reverse); GST-N5, 5\u2032-ATTACGGATCCTGGCCG-CAAATTGCA-3\u2032 (forward), 5\u2032-TCATATCGATTTATGCCTGAGTTGAATC-3\u2032 (reverse); GST-N6, 5\u2032-TAAAGGATCCTCTGATAATGGACCC-3\u2032 (forward), 5\u2032-GCTCATCGATTATGTTGTTCCTTGAGG-3\u2032(reverse); GST-N7, 5\u2032-TAAAGGATCCTCTGATAATGGACCC-3\u2032 (forward), 5\u2032-GCTCATCGAT-TAGCCAATTTGGTCAT-3\u2032 (reverse); GST-229EN, 5\u2032-CGGGATCCGCTA-CAGTCAAATGG-3\u2032 (forward), 5\u2032-CCATCGATTAGTTTACTTCATCAAT-3\u2032 (reverse); GST-229EN1, 5\u2032-CGGGATCCGCTACAGTCAAATGG-3\u2032 (forward), 5\u2032-CCATCGATTATTCCTGAGGCTTGTC-3\u2032 (reverse); and GST-229EN2, 5\u2032-CGGGATCCATGAAGGCAGTTGCT-3\u2032 (forward), 5\u2032-CCATC-GATTAGTTTACTTCATCAAT-3\u2032 (reverse). Mutations were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion or DNA sequencing.\n\n293T and 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (GIBCO). Confluent 293T or 293 cells were trypsinized and split 1:10 onto 10cm dishes 24 h prior to transfection. For each construct, cells were transfected with 20 \u03bcg of plasmid DNA using the calcium phosphate precipitation method; 50 \u03bcm chloroquine was added to enhance transfection efficiency. Unless otherwise indicated, 10 \u03bcg of each plasmid was used for co-transfection. Culture supernatant and cells were harvested for protein analysis 2-3 d post-transfection.\n\nAt 48-72 h post-transfection, supernatant from transfected 293T or 293 cells was collected, filtered, and centrifuged through 2 ml of 20% sucrose in TSE (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA plus 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF]) at 4\u00b0C for 40 min at 274,000 \u00d7g. Pellets were suspended in IPB (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.02% sodium azide) plus 0.1 mM PMSF. Next, cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), collected in IPB plus 0.1 mM PMSF, and microcentrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 15 min at 13,700 \u00d7g to remove cell debris. Supernatant and cell samples were mixed with equal volumes of 2X sample buffer (12.5 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.25% bromophenol blue) and 5% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min. Samples were resolved by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membrane-bound Gag or chimeric proteins were immunodetected using a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against HIV-1 p24CA (Wang et al., 1998) or the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid . SARS-CoV M was detected with a rabbit anti-M polyclonal antibody (Rockland). HAtagged hA3G was probed with a mouse anti-HA (Sigma) monoclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:5000. For HIV-1 Vif detection, a rabbit anti-Vif polyclonal antibody (Goncalves et al., 1994) was used at a 1:2000 dilution. The secondary antibody was a sheep anti-mouse or donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-(HRP) conjugated antibody (Invitrogen), both at 1:5000 dilutions. To detect GST and GST fusions, anti-GST HRP conjugate (Amersham) was used at a 1:5000 dilution. Horseradish peroxidase activity was detected according to the manufacturer's protocol.\n\nGST pull-down assay 293T cells either mock transfected or transfected with GST fusion expression vectors were collected, lysed in RIPA buffer (140 mM NaCl, 8 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS) containing complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and microcentrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 15 min at 13,700 \u00d7g (14,000 rpm) to remove cell debris. Aliquots of post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) were mixed with equal amounts of 2\u00d7 sample buffer and 5% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and held for Western blot analysis. RIPA buffer was added to the remaining PNS samples to final volumes of 500 \u03bcl. Each sample was mixed with glutathione-agarose beads (30 \u03bcl) (Sigma) and rocked for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. Bead-bound complexes were pelleted, washed tree times with RIPA buffer, twice with PBS, eluted at 1\u00d7 sample buffer with 5% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-10% PAGE as described above.\n\nSupernatant cultures of transfected 293T cells were collected, filtered, and centrifuged through 2 ml 20% sucrose cushions as described above. Viral pellets were suspended in PBS buffer and laid on top of a pre-made 20-60% sucrose gradient consisting of 1 ml layers of 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60% sucrose in TSE that had been allowed to sit for 2 h. Gradients were centrifuged in an SW50.1 rotor at 40,000 rpm (274,000 \u00d7g) for 16 h at 4\u00b0C; 500 \u03bcl fractions were collected from top to bottom. Sucrose density was measured for each fraction. Proteins in each fraction were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and subjected to Western immunoblotting.\n\nConfluent 293 cells were split 1:80 onto coverslips 24 h before transfection. Two days post-transfection, cells were fixed at 4\u00b0C for 20 min with ice-cold PBS containing 3.7% formaldehyde, washed once with PBS and once with DMEM plus 10% heat-inactivated calf serum (DMEM/calf serum), and permeabilized at room temperature for 10 min in PBS plus 0.2% Triton X-100. Samples were incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h and secondary antibody for 30 min. Following each incubation, samples were subjected to three washes (5 to 10 min each) with DMEM/calf serum. The primary antibody was an anti-HA (Sigma) at a 1:200 dilution. A rabbit antimouse rhodamine-conjugated antibody at a 1:100 dilution served as the secondary antibody (Cappel, ICN Pharmaceuticals, Aurora, Ohio, USA). After the final DMEM/calf serum wash, the coverslips were washed three times with PBS and mounted in 50% glycerol in PBS for viewing. Images were taken using an epifluorescence microscope (Olympus AX-80) or laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus FV300)."}
