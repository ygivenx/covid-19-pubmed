{"title": "Global health and the Belt and Road Initiative E DITORIAL", "body": "The Belt and Road Initiative provides a unique opportunity to improve health outcomes in vast regions of the world. Launched in 2013, the Initiative has been conceived as a platform for collaboration that is forward-looking and mutually benefi cial. It is being built on shared values and a vision of a common destiny. As the Chinese President Xi Jinping said in September 2018, China hopes to create \"a road of peace, prosperity, openness, green development and innovation and a road that brings together different civilizations.\" [1] The expansion of infrastructure, trade relations, scientific collaboration and connectivity between countries, peoples and cultures could create unprecedented opportunities and synergies to strengthen health systems, eliminate major infectious diseases, and improve the health of hundreds of millions of people. Through its direct and indirect effects, the Belt and Road Initiative could set benefi ciary countries on a fi rm path toward the achievement of universal health coverage-a declared goal of most countries around the world.\n\nThe global health perspective was formally included in Belt and Road in 2015 and was firmly established during the first Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing in May 2017, where plans for a Health Silk Road were announced and endorsed by benefi ciary countries [2] . The World Health Organization (WHO) has welcome China's efforts to integrate health into its ambitious development agenda and has been working with the country to explore opportunities and synergies for collaboration.\n\nChina is well positioned to expand into this area of development for many reasons.\n\nFirst and foremost, China's national achievements in health provide a solid basis for increased international engagement. The country's committed action, spanning nearly seven decades, to improve health outcomes and lift people out of poverty (which resulted, among others, in the reduction of maternal and infant mortality, provision of access to clean water and sanitation to 1.3 billion people, and expansion of insurance coverage of essential health services to over 95% of the population) offers valuable lessons to other countries in the world. China's \"whole of government\" approach to health, and its prioritization of sustainable results, gives added strength and credibility to its achievements.\n\nSecond, the ambition and comprehensiveness of the Belt and Road Initiative is fully in line with the United Nations Agenda for Sustainable Development [3] , in which the goals are integrated and indivisible, global in nature and universally applicable. It is only through increased global cooperation, peer-learning, and multisectoral approaches that we can implement this global development agenda and move towards the ambitious health-related targets.\n\nThird, China is starting to play a major role as a supplier of global public goods. Its capacity to manufacture highquality, safe, and effective medicines, vaccines and medical devices has become a critical resource for global health. Today, China's global impact is felt mainly through its economic engagement but in some regions, for example in Africa, its health-related investments are also visible. These include deployment of Chinese health professionals to work alongside locals in health facilitates, building hospitals and supporting the establishment of the firstever Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nFourth, China's increasingly global role-together with its ambitious domestic health agenda, the Healthy China 2030 plan-has become synonymous with WHO's own ambitions. WHO's 13th General Programme of Work-its current 5-year strategy-is an unprecedented call to transform the role of WHO in global health [4] . The strategy was endorsed by WHO Member States in May 2018 and its key strategic goals are to ensure that, by 2023, one billion more people benefi t from universal health coverage; one billion more people are better protected from health emergencies; and one billion more people enjoy better health and wellbeing. If the world does not meet these 'triple billion' targets, it is unlikely that we will be on track to achieve the health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.\n\nChina's investments in Belt and Road countrieswhether in infrastructure, trade, manufacturing or in the health sector-will all contribute to improving health outcomes and therefore to the achievement of these triple billion goals. In fact, the Belt and Road Initiative provides an unprecedented opportunity for China to make an impact on key global health priorities, such as ending the epidemics of communicable diseases and strengthening primary health care services, and therefore establish itself as a leader in global health.\n\nOf the over 80 Belt and Road beneficiary countries, as many as 16 countries-with a total population of 2.6 billion people-have a high burden of at least three or more endemic infectious diseases, such as HIV, tuberculosis (TB), malaria, viral hepatitis or neglected tropical diseases (unpublished). While most of these diseases are preventable and treatable, getting the necessary interventions to all affected or at-risk populations requires sophisticated logistics, low-cost medicines, strong primary health care systems, and a comprehensive set of community-based solutions.\n\nEighteen of the Belt and Road benefi ciary countries (including India, Indonesia, Pakistan and South Africa) have a high burden of TB, the world's deadliest infectious disease [5] . In 2017, an estimated 820,000 people lost their lives to TB in Belt and Road benefi ciary countries, which is more than 50% of the estimated total of 1.6 million people who died of TB around the world last year (unpublished). In September 2018, the United Nations General Assembly High-level Meeting on TB adopted an ambitious political declaration to urgently address the global public health crisis caused by this disease [6] .\n\nThe infrastructure development, economic growth and scientifi c collaboration that Belt and Road can bring to these countries will lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and strengthen the multi-sectoral responses that are needed to reduce the incidence and mortality from endemic infectious diseases, to improve access to essential diagnosis, medicines, vaccines and health commodities, and to move toward the 2030 goal of \"ending the epidemics\".\n\nChina's experience in strengthening its primary health care system will also be invaluable to these countries as they will not be able to conquer communicable disease epidemics without targeted investments in primary health care. Following the Global Conference on Primary Health Care, held in Kazakhstan in October 2018 [7] , there is now a global momentum around the primary health care agenda, and a growing appetite for international dialogue and sharing of experiences-providing a supportive backdrop for health-related collaboration through Belt and Road.\n\nAs we consider the opportunities created by Belt and Road, we should also pay close attention to potential risks that may arise, in order to anticipate and address them.\n\nInfrastructural development and improved trade relations could lead to changes in the human environment. Improved connectivity leads to a greater flow of people and commodities, and as a result, it could also result in a greater fl ow of epidemic-prone diseases. Massive outbreaks can reverse decades of achievement in disease elimination programmes, impede trade and economic development and negatively impact on tourism revenues. Therefore, strengthening global health security should be a critical component of health collaboration within Belt and Road.\n\nWe do not have to go too far back in history to remember how critically important global collaboration on health security is. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003-which caused over 8,000 cases in 37 countries-prompted a major rethink of the global health security system. As a result, countries renegotiated and adopted a legally-binding international legal framework to strengthen health security-the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) [8]-and began to strengthen core capacities to detect, assess and report public health events.\n\nIn 2014-2015, the Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa was once again a painful reminder of how, in the absence of an early, coordinated and effective response, an outbreak of infectious disease can rapidly overwhelm fragile health systems and trigger a humanitarian crisis. In the aftermath of this outbreak, countries took committed action to further strengthen multilateral cooperation on health and requested WHO to reform the way it deals with emergencies. A robust new global WHO Health Emergencies Programme was established, together with a new Contingency Fund for Emergencies, which allows it to respond immediately to disease outbreaks and humanitarian crises with health consequences.\n\nCurrently, an estimated 1.8 billion people live in fragile contexts, but this fi gure is projected to grow to 2.3 billion by 2030 [9] . In November 2018, the WHO Health Emergencies Programme was responding to over 170 events, including infectious disease outbreaks (such as cholera and yellow fever), as well as hunger and nutritionrelated crises during complex humanitarian emergencies.\n\nChina is well positioned to support this work given its own history of engaging with emergencies. China provided unprecedented support for Ebola-affected countries in West Africa in 2014-2015 and participated in post-Ebola reconstruction through supporting recovery efforts. In the aftermath of this Ebola outbreak, China applied and received certifi cation for three of its Emergency Medical Teams to provide clinical care in the wake of emergencies.\n\nChina has also provided much-needed support for the humanitarian health response to the Syria crisis (2016-2017), and one of the world's largest cholera outbreaks in Yemen (2017). In August 2018, China provided support to the Ebola response in the Democratic Republic of the Congo-an outbreak which claimed over 300 lives by mid-December 2018 [10] , and which has been particularly challenging to fi ght due to the ongoing armed confl ict.\n\nWith the Belt and Road Initiative, China's global engagement on health is being expanded in scope and breadth. This effort is fully in line with the ambition of the SDGs and especially the health-related umbrella goal, achievement of universal health coverage (UHC).\n\nIn order to move towards UHC, countries need to take a broad, systems approach and strengthen their primary health care systems. They also need to build hospitals, strengthen their regulatory systems and expand access to medicines, vaccines, diagnostics tests and other essential health products. They need to place emphasis on reaching the most vulnerable, most underserved populations. As countries go further and further in this journey, China's role as a provider of global public goods will be invaluable.\n\nAs China is emerging as a key player in global health, WHO's collaboration with the government is becoming stronger and more strategic. In January 2017, on the occasion of President Xi Jinping's historic visit to Geneva, WHO and China signed a Memorandum of Understanding on health sector cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative. This agreement laid out a blueprint for strengthening existing cooperation and highlighted a number of specific areas that should be prioritized over the coming years. These include: (1) implementation of the IHR 2005 and public health emergency response, management and health capacity-building as well as construction of emergency medical teams; (2) health system and policies such as universal health coverage; (3) prevention and control of infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and schistosomiasis; (4) prevention and control of non-communicable diseases; (5) traditional medicine and prequalifi cation of Chinese medicines and vaccines; (6) capacity building and personnel training; (7) local production of medicines; (8) other areas of mutual interest in global health cooperation.\n\nSince then, WHO and the Government of China have agreed to institute an annual strategic dialogue and the two parties are working together on a number of demonstration projects in selected countries in WHO's Western Pacifi c and African regions.\n\nIn today's world-as countries' fates are becoming inextricably linked-we are only as strong as our weakest link. We need to work together as a community of nations to build solutions to the complex range of problems that impede human development. Health is an investment that brings manifold returns. Not just to individuals and families, but to communities and entire nations. This is a unique moment in history for increased collaboration between China and Belt and Road benefi ciary countries and WHO will support this process as it pursues its own ambitious agenda to build a world in which all people attain the highest possible level of the health. Given that investing in health is both an opportunity and a necessity, health should remain a key pillar of the Belt and Road Initiative. Given the scale and ambition of this initiative, health could even be considered as a 'low-hanging fruit'. With relatively modest investments, China could achieve significant returns, relatively fast, in vast regions of the world.\n\nBy investing in people's health outside of its borders, China is taking on one of the greatest development challenges of our time. Improved health outcomes will make the world a safer place and help countries and communities to eradicate poverty, improve productivity and create sustainable economies. This is truly a win-win for all."}
