{"title": "TITLE PAGE Manuscript title: Cross-reaction of sera from COVID-19 patients with SARS-CoV assays", "body": "SARS-CoV-2 is a new zoonotic coronavirus (CoV) that emerged in Wuhan, China which 19 was first reported on the 31 st December 2019. As the number of cases of COVID-19 increases, 20 there is an urgent need to understand this outbreak that looks set to spread to several countries 21 around the world. The total number of cases is probably a gross underestimate, as patients may 22 present with the symptoms of the common cold, and therefore remain undiagnosed due to the 23 mild nature of this illness in the majority. Poorer resourced countries may also not have the 24 capability to equip themselves with complex molecular diagnostic setups and thus outbreaks in 25 those areas may go undetected for some time and the number of cases under reported. 26 The SARS-CoV-2 is a SARS-related virus with 74.5% genome identity to SARS-CoV. 1 \n\nThe similarities between these two viruses were described comprehensively in a recent published 28 article by Xu et al. 2 For structural proteins, including the nucleocapsid (N), matrix (M), and 29 envelope (E), high within-group conservation was maintained, with more modest similarity seen 30 across the entire CoV family. In contrast, the accessory proteins that distinguish CoV infections 31 from each other with high variability across the family, allow viruses to adopt to current and 32 novel hosts. 3 In a study which described the difference in amino acid substitutions of different 33 proteins for SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV, it was found that there were no substitutions 34 that occurred in nonstructural protein 7 (nsp7), nsp13, envelop, matrix and accessory proteins p6 35 and 8b. 4 The N protein for SARS-CoV-2 has ~90% similar amino acid identity to the SAR-CoV 36 N protein and hence the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against the N protein would likely recognize 37 and bind the SARS-CoV N protein as well. 5 Furthermore, a study by Zhou et al, showed that the 38 .

The Biochemistry department removed all patient identifiers and assigned random 52 numbers to each patient, and also included the number of days after onset of illness for each of 53 the retrieved specimens based on the information obtained from the Infectious Diseases team.\n\nFor negative controls, 10 samples which were sent for unrelated virology tests from 2 different 55 groups of patients were randomly selected. The first group consists of 5 sera collected 5 years 56 ago from our archive and the other group, another 5 sera from patients who were tested negative 57 .

A total of 26 samples were retrieved from the Biochemistry department.\n\nThe number of samples obtained for each patient ranged from 1 -9 (mean 3.7) with the earliest 70 taken 1 day after the onset of symptoms and latest at day 24. Five specimens were excluded due 71 to the narrow interval between samples or close proximity to the date of onset of illness. Figure 1 (<100, 100, 400, 1600, \u22656400) .

Although the overall results for the IIFA test may be more sensitive, 101 the IIFA IgM test in the COVID-19 patients was found to be less useful in the detection of acute 102 phase of the illness which is consistent with the findings of a study in SARS-CoV patients where 103 they found a less frequent (43%) and robust (less discriminatory) IgM response. 13 However, this 104 cannot be generalized as different assays will have different performances depending on the type 105 of antigen utilized. In most countries, real-time RT-PCR remains the diagnostic tool of choice in 106 the acute phase of infection given that antibody will take time to develop after the onset of 107 illness. These serological tests would be more useful in those who did not present early to a 108 healthcare facility to look for evidence of previous exposure to this virus. This is relevant for 109 contact tracing and to determine the true extent of the circulation of the virus to establish an 110 accurate case-fatality rate.\n\nThere is a possibility that positive antibodies from these tests could be as a result of 112 previous exposure to SARS 17 years ago. However, given that only 8,096 cases were reported 113 .
