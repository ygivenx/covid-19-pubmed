{"title": "Distribution of the 2019-nCoV Epidemic and Correlation with Population Emigration from Wuhan, China", "body": "Emerging infectious diseases are still great challenges in the 21st century. In recent years, worldwide outbreaks of Ebola and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) caused great health and economic losses [1] [2] [3] . The reported 27 cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause, and many cases were related to the Wuhan Southern China Seafood Market, which was subsequently closed on January 1, 2020 4 . On January 7, 2020, laboratory test results showed that the pathogen of unexplained pneumonia was a new type of coronavirus, which was then officially named 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO) 5, 6 . The 2019-nCoV outbreak started in Wuhan, and then spread rapidly to other provinces and countries 7, 8 . As of January 30, 2020, a total of 34 provinces and regions in China have reported 9,692 cases. Nearly all imported cases were derived from Wuhan, Hubei province 9, 10 . The 2019-nCoV pneumonia was defined as a class B infectious disease but managed as class A infectious disease by the Chinese government. Daily case reports are being released and any omission or concealment is punishable by law. At present, the number of cases is still increasing and the epidemic has not yet reached its peak, but the situation differs by province. .\n\nInformation about the temporal and spatial distributions of the cases is important for preparation of a targeted treatment and prevention strategy. Because the return peak of Spring Festival transport is coming, the information on possible changes in incidence in different cities will help us to prepare in advance. Therefore, we investigated the temporal and spatial distributions of the early epidemic to reveal the dynamic changes and trends.\n\nThese results will provide valuable information for the disease prevention for both individuals and organizations.\n\nAll officially reported confirmed, suspected, severe cases and deaths of 2019-nCoV pneumonia were collected from the internet (website:). Case data were imported into Excel and incidence per 100,000 was calculated. No ethical approval is needed for this study.\n\nThe national and Hubei province shapefiles are used for ArcGIS analysis. The map is linked to Excel file with time and spatial information. The risk analysis of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia is based on the Bayesian space-time model of WinBUGS software 11, 12 . The model is divided into three levels:\n\n(1) Data model For the statistical data of low incidence, it is assumed to follow the Poisson distribution of the parameters ni and \u03bcit: yit ~ Poiss (ni\u03bcit), where Hubei province yit is i (1,\u2026., 16) cities at t (1,\u2026, 11) the number of cases that occurred during the day. The nationwide yit is the number of cases that occurred in t (1,\u2026, 11) days in i (1,\u2026., 240) cities. We assume that there is no change in the number of people at risk in each city during the study period, where ni is the number of people at risk in the town (i), and \u03bcit is the corresponding disease risk in the city (t) per day (i).\n\n(2) Process model interaction. Relative to b0, it is the local change trend of each city based on b0; \u03b5it is used to explain local changes that cannot be explained by spatiotemporal random effects. 13 (3) Parametric model\n\nAccording to the BYM model 14 , a spatial structure effect is defined by a prior conditional autoregressive (CAR) structure. In this process, a spatial adjacency weight matrix needs to be defined. The weight adjacency is wij=1, otherwise the weight wij=0, and the special wij=0.\n\nSimilarly, b1i is also assumed to follow the BYM process. For the time structure effect \u03c5t, a .

By calculating the probability of spatial relative risk, exp (si) is greater than 1 and divided into five categories: areas with probability> 0.8, 0.6-0.8, 0.4-0.6, 0.2-0.4, and <0.2 are defined as hot spots, secondary hot spots, warm-spots, sub-cold spots, and cold-spots respectively. Similarly, based on the probability threshold, the differences in these classification regions can be identified based on the trend over time. The probability that exp (b1i) is greater than 1 is divided into five categories: cities with an incidence risk probability greater than 0.8 have a rapid change trend relative to the overall risk change; between 0.6 and 0.8 indicate that the change trend of the incidence risk is greater than the overall risk change; 0.4 to 0.6 indicates that the occurrence risk is the same as the overall risk change trend; 0.2 to 0.4 indicates that the change trend of the disease risk is slower than the overall risk change; the change trend of the disease risk in cities with a probability less than 0.2 is more slower than the overall risk.\n\nPopulation migration data were collected from Baidu dataset (http://qianxi.baidu.com/).\n\nData on emigration from Wuhan City and Hubei province to other cities and provinces were extracted and edited with Excel of windows Microsoft office. Emigration intensity was calculated as migration index multiplied with proportions of the province or city.\n\n.

As shown in Figure 1A , the number of cases remained stable from January 11 to 15, 2020, and the number of newly added and cumulative cases increased rapidly after January 16. The first death was reported on January 10, and the number of deaths began to increase rapidly from January 17, with the cumulative death number reaching 312 on January 30 ( Figure 1B ) 6 . After the nucleic acid assay becoming available, suspected cases waiting for laboratory confirmation could now be diagnosed more rapidly 17 . After January 19, suspected cases increased rapidly, and about 40-50% of these suspected cases were then diagnosed as confirmed cases ( Figure 1C ). Before January 19, the number of severe cases, remained at a low level but increased steadily since January 20 ( Figure 1D ). Because Wuhan is the capital city of Hubei province and the cases have spread to the rest of Hubei province quickly, we also analyzed the change in number of cases in Hubei province. On January 9, 41 cases were first reported, and by January 30, 5,806 cases were reported, accounting for 59.91% of the total cases in China ( Figure 1E ). The cumulative number of deaths in Hubei province is 249, accounting for 96.14% of total deaths in China ( Figure 1F ). These data indicated that both the incidence and mortality of 2019-nCoV disease is the highest in Hubei province 18 . Before January 16, cases were mainly reported in Hubei province. From January 17 onward, the outbreak spread to many provinces and the number of cases increased rapidly. Therefore, our spatial and temporal analyses used data from January 17 to January 30, 2020.\n\nLocation of each case was extracted from official reports and mapped on the national map .

Of the 362 cities, 307 (84.8%) had reported cases. In general, the core outbreak area, Wuhan and its surrounding cities, had the highest number of cases, followed by cities with high population that are transportation hubs (Figure 2A ). Spatial distribution was then analyzed with a Bayesian model using WinBUGS 13, 14 . After iterating nearly 100,000 times, the model converged successfully. After the model converged, it iterated another 110,000 times to obtain parameter estimations. A ratio close to 1 indicates that the two chain iterative sequences are close, and that the model has a good convergence and is stable ( Figure 2B ). With the established model and parameters, hot and cold spots were identified.\n\nThe results showed that Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hainan, and Taiwan were hot spots, and Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Chongqing, Hunan, and Guangxi were secondary hot spots. Generally, hot spots clustered in the Midwest and cold spots clustered in the Southeast ( Figure 2D ).\n\nThe overall temporal trend was calculated using the time risk model (exp(b0t*+vt)), which described the general incidence risk by time during the period from January 16 to January 30, 2020. The results showed that b0 is estimated to be 0.4604, that is, the disease risk on the following day is approximately 1.585 times higher than the previous day. The relative risk by time increased steadily from January 20 and remained in an upward trend as of January 30 ( Figure 2C ). From this, it can be estimated that the number of cases nationwide is on the rise. Figure 2E , Heilongjiang, Hebei, Beijing, Tianjin, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Jiangsu, Hunan, Taiwan, and Hainan showed faster increased in cases than the overall national trend. The increase of cases in Jilin, Liaoning, Shanxi, Guangxi, and Fujian provinces were also relatively fast. The increase of cases in other provinces were consistent with or lower than the overall 30, the case number has exceeded the total number of the SARS-CoV outbreak 20 . To cope with the outbreak, the Spring Festival holiday had been extended for two times. Prevention and control of the outbreak became a concerted action of the whole people in China.\n\nAlthough all people participated in the campaign against the outbreak, people in area with low case number considered that the disease is far away. Therefore, awareness of high-risk regions is import for preparation and responses for all the people, particularly those in regions with low incidence. Another reason we need to keep in mind is that 5 millions of persons have been emigrated from Wuhan to all over the country, we do not know exact who of them are virus carriers, and it is impossible to track and diagnose them all. Therefore, isolation at home and less contact with others is the most efficient measure to prevent infection and transmission.\n\nWith the reported cases, we analyzed the temporal and spatial distribution. In general, the number of cases is still on the rise. For Hubei Province, which has the highest number of cases and deaths, the growing trend is relatively stable. Conversely in other hot spots, the number of cases were not so high, but the rate of growth continues to rise and therefore should be closely monitored. It is particularly noteworthy that cities with the fastest change in temporal risk, such as Chongqing, have large population movements and rapid temporal risk.\n\nIf they are not strictly monitored, there may be more outbreaks. In order to prevent disease outbreaks caused by the returning travel wave to the city after the Spring Festival, the country has extended the Spring Festival holiday twice to February 9, 2020. However, as the number of new cases is still increasing, the outbreak is unlikely to end before the end of the holiday. Therefore, we must act together to stop the spread of the disease.
