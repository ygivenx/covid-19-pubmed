{"title": "Association between Severity of MERS-CoV Infection and Incubation\nPeriod", "body": "We retrieved publicly available data from the Korea Center for Disease Control and\nPrevention, the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare, the World Health Organization,\nand local news reports in South Korea to compile a list of all confirmed cases that had\nbeen reported by July 26, 2015 (6). Exposure data were available for 109 (64%) of 170 patients.\nFor most cases, information on exposure was recorded as intervals\n>2 days during which infection was believed to have\noccurred, rather than exact dates of presumed infection. For the subset of patients\nwithout available exposure data, we assumed that their incubation time was 0\u201321\ndays because 21 days was the longest incubation period reported (9,10). Data for patients is provided in Technical Appendix 1.\n\nTo estimate incubation period distribution, we fitted a gamma distribution that enabled\ninterval censoring (6) by using\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo methods in a Bayesian framework (Technical Appendix 2) (9). In this analysis and analyses described below, we\nspecified flat priors for each parameter and drew 10,000 samples from the posterior\ndistributions after a burn-in of 5,000 iterations.\n\nTo evaluate potential factors, such as age and sex, that could be associated with length\nof incubation period, we fitted a multiple linear regression model to the data with the\nlog incubation period as response variable and age and sex as explanatory variables. To\ndetermine the association between incubation period and severity of disease, we first\nestimated the difference in mean incubation period between patients who died and those\nwho survived. However, this analysis could not account for potential confounders.\nTherefore, we specified a multivariable logistic regression model in which death was the\nbinary response variable and predictors included age, sex, and the incubation time for\neach patient (9). We performed\nthis analysis by using an exact likelihood approach and incubation times resampled from\nthe 10,000 posterior samples in each iteration (Technical Appendix 2). All analyses were conducted by using R version 3.0.2\n(R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Raw data and R syntax\nenabling reproduction of results are available from the Dryad Digital Repository\n(http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.v3456).\n\nOf 170 patients in this study, 36 (21%) died. Mean patient age was 54.6 years, and 98\n(58%) were male. Patients who died were significantly older than patients who survived\n(68.9 years vs. 50.8 years; p<0.001). No differences regarding age, sex, and\ncase-fatality risk were observed between patients with or without recorded exposure\ndata. We estimated a mean incubation period of MERS-CoV in all 170 patients of 6.9 days\n(95% credibility interval [CrI] 6.3\u20137.5 days) by using a gamma distribution. Age\nand sex had no associations with incubation period.\n\nThe mean incubation period was 6.4 days (95% CrI 5.2\u20137.9 days) for 36 patients\nwho died compared with 7.1 days (95% CrI 6.3\u20137.8 days) for 134 patients who\nsurvived (Figure). The difference in means was 0.62\ndays (95% CrI \u22120.99 to 2.04 days). In the multivariable logistic regression\nmodel, we found that a longer incubation period was associated with a marginally reduced\nrisk for death (odds ratio 0.83/1-day increase in incubation period, 95% CrI\n0.68\u20131.03/day) after adjustment for age and sex (Technical Appendix 2 Table 2).\n\nTo examine sensitivity of our results, we also fitted the logistic regression models by\nusing 3 categories for the incubation period. We observed similar results and a reduced\nrisk for death associated with longer incubation periods (Technical Appendix 2 Table 2). Results were also consistent in the\nsubset of 109 patients with recorded exposure intervals (Technical Appendix 2 Table 2).\n\nWe estimated the incubation period of MERS-CoV cases during the recent MERS outbreak in\nSouth Korea and found that patients who died had a shorter incubation period than\npatients who survived. In a previous study, we found that the length of incubation\nperiod in patients infected with SARS coronavirus was also correlated with severity of\nthe disease, with a shorter incubation period for patients who died (9). The pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and\nSARS coronavirus infection is similar (11), with a rapid progression to respiratory failure and\nintubation occurring \u22481 week after onset of symptoms and up to 5 days earlier in\nMERS patients than in SARS patients (4,12). Moreover, high rates of hemoptysis were observed in\npatients infected with MERS-CoV, which suggests severe lung injury (4).\n\nMERS-CoV also has higher replication rates and shows broader cell tropism in the lower\nhuman respiratory tract than severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (13). These results suggest that a\nshorter incubation period could be related to a higher initial infective dose and\nconsequently to faster or greater pathogen replication. This finding could lead to a\nmore severe disease induced by more aggressive and damaging inflammatory responses\n(14). Closer monitoring of\npatients who have a shorter incubation period could be considered during such\noutbreaks.\n\nAnother potential explanation for our findings is that patients with longer incubation\nperiods were identified and infection confirmed more quickly. This improvement in time\nto identification and admission to a hospital led to improved prognosis. Although longer\nincubation periods were correlated with shorter delays from onset to laboratory\nconfirmation, we did not find evidence of a strong mediating effect of delay from onset\nto laboratory confirmation on the risk for death. However, with the small sample size,\nthere was limited statistical power to detect a small-to-moderate effect.\n\nOur study had some limitations. Our estimates of the incubation period were based on\nself-reported exposure data, which could be affected by recall bias. Moreover, 61\npatients (36%) included in our main analysis had missing exposure data, and inclusion in\na Bayesian framework with a wide interval of 0\u201321 days was necessary. Both of\nthese limitations could have reduced the statistical power of our study to identify an\nassociation. Finally, we did not have information on underlying medical conditions or\nthe geographic location of cases, or the treatments that were given to cases, and these\nvariables could have been associated with clinical outcomes.\n\nIn conclusion, we found an association between shorter incubation periods among patients\nwith MERS-CoV infection and a higher risk of death subsequently, similar to the\nassociation previously reported for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (9). This association might occur\nbecause the duration of the incubation period is an early reflection of disease\npathogenesis."}
