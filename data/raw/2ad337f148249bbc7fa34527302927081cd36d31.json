{"title": "An audit of the use of isolation facilities in a UK National Health Service trust", "body": "The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome demonstrated the high morbidity and mortality that patients and staff can suffer if appropriate infection control interventions, including isolation, are not undertaken. 1 Patients and healthcare staff are also at risk from many other more common infections, such as chickenpox, Escherichia coli 0157, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis. 2 prospective survey of the use of dedicated isolation facilities in a UK teaching hospital, that this is not always the case. 3 This survey showed, for example, that one-third of patients admitted to a dedicated isolation room were not thought to be an infection risk by experienced healthcare staff.\n\nOur previous survey was performed on the infection unit at Kings Cross Hospital, the old Dundee 'fever' hospital, prior to the transfer of the region's dedicated isolation facilities to Ninewells Hospital, a 1000-bed university teaching hospital. This facility had 10 isolation and 12 open-bay beds and was open 24 h/day to unselected infection admissions from primary and secondary care. The new facility has 14 isolation and four open-bay beds and is open to primary care between 9 am and 5 pm during weekdays. Out of hours, infection patients are usually admitted to the medical admissions unit unless they are considered to be high risk (e.g. chickenpox or pulmonary tuberculosis). Patients are subsequently transferred to the infection unit.\n\nIt was our perception that the transfer of services to the more accessible central site would increase the demand for isolation, especially from specialities such as haematology and surgery. A guideline for the admission of patients to the new facility was therefore developed and disseminated to general practitioners and hospital staff (Table I) .\n\nThe aim of the present study was to analyse the use of isolation beds one year after the opening of the new facility, and to compare this with the results of our previous audit.\n\nA two-month prospective survey during February and March 2003 was performed. A trained medical student collected data daily (except at weekends). The initial diagnosis prompting admission to the isolation facility, basic demographics and other relevant clinical details were recorded. All patients admitted to a dedicated isolation bed were Infections requiring isolation Suspected/proven enteric infection, e.g. Escherichia coli 0157 and hepatitis A Varicella-zoster virus infection, i.e. chickenpox a and shingles (other droplet/airborne spread viral infections, e.g. measles a and influenza, are also appropriate) HIV-positive or 'high-risk' patients with respiratory tract infection requiring exclusion of tuberculosis and/or an induced sputum for PCP Suspected/proven pulmonary tuberculosis a , particularly if multi-drug resistance (MDR-TB) is suspected (MDR-TB must be admitted to one of the negatively pressurized isolation rooms) Patients with other resistant organisms (mostly infection, but some colonization if isolation in the ID unit is requested by the infection control team) at high risk of transmitting to other patients, e.g. a patient with a productive cough and confirmed penicillin-resistant pneumococcal pneumonia Fever within three weeks of travel to an area where there is a risk of viral haemorrhagic fever a , in particular sub-Saharan Africa Herpes-simplex virus and other contagious skin infections (e.g. impetigo), particularly if extensive/severe such as in eczema herpeticum Patients requiring 'protective' isolation may be admitted to one of the isolation cubicles if a suitable bed is not available on one of the oncology/haematology wards or if the patient poses a significant risk to other vulnerable patients (e.g. chickenpox or shingles) The following infections do not always require isolation but may benefit from ID nursing and medical expertise, and can be discussed with senior ID staff who will arrange admission, depending on risk assessment and bed status Suspected/proven viral or bacterial meningitis/encephalitis Severe community-acquired pneumonia if the respiratory unit is full Skin, soft tissue and bone infections, particularly if Streptococcus pyogenes is suspected/proven or if the patient is suitable for the outpatient and home parenteral therapy service Bacterial tonsillitis, particularly if S. pyogenes is suspected/proven (suspected quinsy should be referred to Ear, Nose and Throat Department) Glandular fever Severe sepsis or septic shock of any cause Extrapulmonary tuberculosis Pyrexia of unknown origin Other patients may also be appropriate-please discuss with ID staff HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; PCP, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia; ID, infectious diseases. a Ideally these infections should be admitted to one of the negatively pressurized isolation rooms.\n\nincluded. Data were collected using a pre-piloted data collection form, and were subsequently transcribed to an Excel database. Two members of the study team assessed the appropriateness of each isolation episode independently according to the following criteria.\n\n(1) Infection or non-infection-i.e. whether the patient was suspected or proven to have an infection by healthcare staff on admission. (2) Infection risk or non-infection risk-i.e.\n\nwhether the patient was a potential communicable infection risk at the point of admission according to the Tayside Health Board's infection control guidelines. 4 (3) Appropriate or inappropriate admissionaccording to the local guidelines for admission to the new facility (Table I) .\n\nTo allow comparison, data from our previous audit (February-May 2000) were re-analysed according to the above criteria. Statistical analyses were performed using Excel and SPSS for Windows (version 10). Where appropriate, percentages and 95% confidence intervals are presented. c 2 test was used to compare the use of isolation facilities before and after the transfer.\n\nDuring the study period, 112 patients were admitted to the infection unit. Of these, 98 patients (54% female) were isolated in a designated isolation room. These patients used 808 bed-days, with a bed occupancy of 98%. Of the isolated patients, only 44% (NZ44) were considered to be a potential communicable infection risk, although 83% (NZ81) were thought to have an infection and 80% (NZ78) were appropriately admitted according to the local admission guidance (Table I) . Patients thought not to have an infection used 99 bed-days (12% of total bed-days). Patients thought not to be an infection risk used 418 bed-days (52% of total bed-days). Table II summarizes these results and shows comparisons, using the same criteria, with our previous audit cohort. Table III shows a comparison of admission diagnoses before and after implementation of the local admission guidance.\n\nBy all three criteria, the utilization of the dedicated isolation facilities deteriorated following the transfer of services from a small peripheral to a large central site. Although approximately 80% of patients were deemed to have been admitted appropriately according to our local admission guidance (Table I) , many of these patients had low-risk infections, with less than half of all patients thought to be an infection risk. In contrast, prior to the transfer, 90% of patients would have been admitted appropriately according to the admission guidance, with over two-thirds of patients thought to be an infection risk. This deterioration appears to be due to three main factors. Firstly, a higher proportion of isolated patients had low-risk infections, in particular, lower respiratory or urinary tract infections. Secondly, a higher proportion of patients had noninfection, general medical diagnoses. Thirdly, there was a fall in the proportion of patients with gastroenteritis. Whether the latter represents a true reduction in incidence or a change in referral pattern is unknown. Further investigation is merited to ensure that patients with infectious diarrhoea are not being housed inappropriately on open wards.\n\nAlmost all of the patients with general medical diagnoses were transferred to the infection unit as 'boarders' under the care of a non-infection, general physician during a period of high bed pressure in the hospital (usually at night or over the weekend). From our own experience and that of others, it would seem unlikely that other more appropriate (i.e. higher-risk) patients were not available for transfer either from the medical admissions unit or other parts of the hospital. Unpublished audit data from our own hospital have suggested that if side and isolation rooms were used more appropriately, the vast majority of patients deemed to be at high risk of transmitting an alert infection could be housed in a side or isolation room. Such findings highlight the difficulty of implementing ideal infection control practice in a 'real-world' environment. A more dynamic approach to bed management with improved recognition of the importance of considering infection control issues when housing patients and the use of 'real-time' information technology could potentially improve isolation room use. Although our local guidance for admission of patients to isolation accommodates some lower-risk infection patients, such as those with severe community-acquired pneumonia, the increased proportion of patients with low-risk diagnoses is likely to represent the common misconception that infection units are for patients with any infection. Following this audit, one of the senior infection unit staff attends the medical admissions unit on a daily basis to liaise with the admitting medical team and nursing staff, and to assess and prioritize admission to the infection unit. Anecdotally, this approach appears to have improved the use of isolation beds, although further audit will be required to confirm this.\n\nThe findings also highlight the difficulty in changing professional behaviour when implementing guidance, particularly if external barriers exist, such as high bed pressures. 5 Our local guidance for admission to the infection unit was disseminated in paper format to general practitioners and relevant hospital staff and wards. The guidance was also presented at medical unit meetings. It is increasingly recognized, however, that a multi-faceted approach (e.g. a combination of reminders, feedback and interactive educational sessions, etc.) may be required for successful implementation. 6 In conclusion, these data show deterioration in the use of dedicated isolation beds following the transfer of facilities to a central teaching hospital site, mainly due to inappropriate admission of lowrisk and general medical patients. In an era when nosocomial infection is increasingly important, National Health Service trusts should ensure that dedicated isolation facilities are used appropriately."}
