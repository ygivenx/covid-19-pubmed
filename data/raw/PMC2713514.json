{"title": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus M Protein Inhibits Type I\nInterferon Production by Impeding the Formation of\nTRAF3\u00b7TANK\u00b7TBK1/IKK\u03f5 Complex*", "body": "pIFN\u03b2-Luc and RIG-I expression vector (33) were kind gifts from Dr. Takashi Fujita (Kyoto University, Kyoto,\nJapan). TBK1 and IRF3 expression plasmids (34,\n35) were provided by Dr. Genhong Cheng\n(University of California, Los Angeles, CA). IRF7 plasmid (36) was supplied by Dr. Luwen Zhang (University of Nebraska,\nLincoln, NE). TRAF6 expression vector (37) was\nobtained from Dr. Tohru Ishitani (Kyushu University, Kyushu, Japan). TRAF3 cDNA (38) was kindly provided by Drs. Liusheng He and\nPeter Lipsky (NIAMS, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). pISRE-Luc was from\nClontech. cDNA clones for IKK\u03f5, MDA5, VISA, and TANK were obtained from\nimaGenes GmbH (Berlin, Germany). TLR3 plasmid used in the construction of HEK293/TLR3\nstable cell line has been described (39).\npLTR-Luc reporter plasmid driven by the long terminal repeats of human T-cell leukemia\nvirus type 1 and Tax expression vector pIEX have been described (40).\n\nThe GZ50 strain of SARS coronavirus was propagated in Vero cells in a Biosafety Level\n3 laboratory as described (31, 32). Sendai virus was obtained from American Type\nCulture Collection. HEK293/ACE2 cells infected with 5 multiplicity of infection of\nSARS coronavirus or Sendai virus were harvested to 1\u00d7 SDS gel loading buffer\n(50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol,\nand 0.02% bromphenol blue) for protein analysis or to cell lysis buffer (50\nmm Tris\u00b7Cl, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm\nMgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) for RNA\nanalysis.\n\nAnti-FLAG and anti-\u03b1-tubulin antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Anti-V5\nwas from Invitrogen. Anti-IFR3, anti-TRAF3, anti-IKK\u03f5, and anti-Myc were from\nSanta Cruz. Anti-phospho-IRF3 was from Cell Signaling. Anti-GM130 was from BD\nTransduction Laboratories. Anti-N was from Imgenex.\n\nImmunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and dual luciferase assay were carried out as\ndescribed (41, 42). Relative luciferase activity in arbitrary units was calculated by\nnormalizing firefly luciferase activity to Renilla luciferase\nactivity.\n\nConfocal immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described (43, 44).\nCells were fixed in 1:1 (v:v) acetone/methanol for 10 min and imaged using LSM510\nsystem (Carl Zeiss).\n\nTBK1/IKK\u03f5 kinase activity was assayed in vitro as described\n(42, 43). Briefly, TBK1/IKK\u03f5-containing protein complex was\nimmunoprecipitated from transfected HEK293 cells. The precipitates were suspended in\nkinase buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mm\n\u03b2-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm\nNa3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2) and incubated with\n[\u03b3-32P]ATP and recombinant I\u03baB\u03b1 (Santa Cruz) or\nIRF3 (Abnova). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.\n\nSARS coronavirus N protein has been shown to antagonize the production of type I\ninterferons (7). In our study of the gene\nregulatory function of N protein (32), we\nincluded M protein as a control and found serendipitously that M protein was a more\npotent inhibitor of interferon \u03b2 promoter when compared with N protein (Fig. 1). Considered together with the ability of M\nprotein to interact with host factors and to modulate expression of cellular genes\n(25\u201329), we set out to characterize M protein-mediated\ninhibition of type I interferon production in detail.\n\nAs a first step, we expressed M protein transiently in HEK293 and HeLa cells. The M\nprotein-expressing cells did not show any growth defect, and no signs of apoptosis\nwere observed (Fig. 1A). M\nprotein was abundantly found in transfected cells (Fig.\n1B). Consistent with a predominant Golgi localization shown\nin previous reports (21, 23), M protein was found to co-localize substantially with GM130\n(Fig. 1A), a marker of the\nGolgi apparatus (45). Expression of M protein\ndid not suppress transcription driven by the long terminal repeats of human T-cell\nleukemia virus type 1, which was stimulated by viral transactivator Tax (Fig. 1C). Hence, M protein is\nunlikely a general inhibitor of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription. Next, we\nassessed the influence of M protein expression on the induction of interferon\n\u03b2 gene transcription using pIFN\u03b2-Luc, a luciferase reporter construct\ndriven by interferon \u03b2 promoter (33).\nNotably, expression of M protein led to significant and dose-dependent suppression of\ndsRNA-induced activation of interferon \u03b2 promoter (Fig. 1D). This suppression by M protein was more\npronounced than the effect of two previously reported viral antagonists of interferon\nproduction, SARS coronavirus N protein and influenza A virus NS1 protein (7, 39). In\ncontrast, E or ORF7a protein of SARS coronavirus did not modulate the activation of\ninterferon \u03b2 promoter by dsRNA (Fig.\n1D). When we repeated the luciferase assay with a reporter\nconstruct driven by canonical ISRE enhancer elements, which were bound to IRF3 and\nIRF7 (36, 46, 47), the same pattern of\ninhibitory activity mediated by M, N, and influenza A virus NS1 proteins was observed\n(Fig. 1E). These results\nsuggested that SARS coronavirus M protein is a potent inhibitor of the activity of\nIRF-responsive elements in the interferon \u03b2 promoter.\n\nWe next addressed at which step of the signaling pathway M protein might inhibit\ndsRNA-induced production of type I interferons. Various transducer proteins that are\npreviously known to stimulate interferon production (13\u201317) were\nused to activate ISRE-dependent expression of luciferase reporter (Fig. 2). These include cytoplasmic dsRNA sensors\nRIG-I (Fig. 2A) and MDA5 (Fig. 2B), adaptor protein\nVISA/IPS1/MAVS/Cardif (Fig. 2E),\nand protein kinases TBK1 (Fig.\n2C) and IKK\u03f5 (Fig.\n2D) as well as ISRE binding transcription factors IRF3\n(Fig. 2F) and IRF7 (Fig. 2G). All of these transducer\nproteins tested strongly activated the enhancer activity of ISRE (Fig. 2).\n\nInterestingly, expression of M protein suppressed ISRE-driven transcriptional\nactivity induced by RIG-I, MDA5, VISA, TBK1, and IKK\u03f5 but not by IRF3 or IRF7\n(Fig. 2). In these assays, SARS coronavirus N,\nE, or ORF7a protein was unable to counteract any ISRE activator. Thus, although both N\nand M proteins inhibited interferon production (7), they plausibly acted through different mechanisms. Consistent with\nprevious findings (48\u201350), influenza A virus\nNS1 protein inhibited the stimulatory activity of RIG-I, MDA5, TBK1, and IKK\u03f5\n(Fig. 2, A \u223c D).\nHowever, unlike SARS coronavirus M protein, NS1 had no influence on the activity of\nVISA (Fig. 2E). These results\nsuggested that M protein suppressed interferon production in a manner distinct from\nthat of NS1.\n\nM protein inhibited TBK1/IKK\u03f5-dependent activation of interferon production\nbut was unable to counteract the action of transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7 (Fig. 2). This pattern of inhibitory activity\nsuggested that M protein might function at a step before nuclear activation of IRF3\nand IRF7. In light of this, we next investigated whether M protein physically\ninteracted with the cytoplasmic transducer proteins. We overexpressed M and individual\ntransducer proteins RIG-I, MDA5, TBK1, IKK\u03f5, TANK, TRAF3, and TRAF6 in HEK293\ncells and performed reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation to assess their interactions\n(Fig. 3). Although both M protein and the\ntransducer proteins were expressed abundantly in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3A), M protein was found to co-precipitate\nwith RIG-I, TBK1, IKK\u03f5, and TRAF3 but not with MDA5, TANK, or TRAF6 (Fig. 3, B and C).\nNotably, precipitations with two different antibodies yielded similar results (Fig. 3B compared with Fig. 3C), suggesting that M protein\nconsistently formed a complex with RIG-I, TBK1, IKK\u03f5, and TRAF3. In keeping\nwith this notion, M protein was found to co-localize substantially with IKK\u03f5\nand TRAF3 in HeLa cells to discrete cytoplasmic subdomains that were compatible with\nthe Golgi complex (Fig. 4). Particularly,\nIKK\u03f5 was sporadically found in multiple cytoplasmic dots in the absence of M\nprotein (Fig. 4, panels\n1\u20133). In contrast, IKK\u03f5 was more concentrated to the M\nprotein-containing region in cells expressing M protein (Fig. 4, panels 7\u20139).\n\nThe association of M protein with TBK1/IKK\u03f5 (Fig. 3) raised two possibilities that might explain the inhibition of\ninterferon production. First, M protein might inhibit catalytic activity of\nTBK1/IKK\u03f5 to phosphorylate IRF3/IRF7. Second, M protein might interfere with\nthe formation of TRAF3\u00b7TANK\u00b7TBK1/IKK\u03f5 complex required for\nphosphorylation of IRF3/IRF7 in the cytoplasm. To test these possibilities, we\nassessed the impact of M protein on the kinase activity of TBK1/IKK\u03f5 both\nin vitro and in vivo. We expressed M protein and\nTBK1/IKK\u03f5 in HEK293 cells (Fig.\n5A) and immunoprecipitated TBK1/IKK\u03f5-containing\nprotein complex (Fig. 5B). The\nprecipitates were then incubated with recombinant I\u03baB\u03b1 or recombinant\nIRF3. Phosphorylated I\u03baB\u03b1 and IRF3 were analyzed by autoradiography\n(Fig. 5, C and\nD). Notably, the TBK1/IKK\u03f5 complex purified from M\nprotein-expressing cells contained M protein (Fig.\n3C). However, the TBK1/IKK\u03f5 complexes containing or\nnot containing M protein showed similar activity to phosphorylate I\u03baB\u03b1\nor IRF3 (Fig. 5, C and\nD, lane 3 compared with lane 2\nand lane 6 compared with lane 5). Thus, the\nexpression of M protein did not modulate the catalytic activity of TBK1/IKK\u03f5\nkinase.\n\nOn the other hand, phosphorylated IRF3 was detected in cultured HEK293 cells\nexpressing TBK1/IKK\u03f5 alone but not in cells simultaneously expressing\nTBK1/IKK\u03f5 and M protein, whereas comparable amounts of IRF3 were found in all\ndifferent groups of cells (Fig. 6, lane\n2 compared with lane 3 and lane 4\ncompared with lane 5). These results were consistent with the notion\nthat M protein inhibits in vivo phosphorylation of IRF3 by\nTBK1/IKK\u03f5.\n\nTo verify the relevance of M protein-mediated inhibitory effects to SARS coronavirus\ninfection, we also examined phosphorylation of IRF3 and production of interferon\n\u03b2 transcript in cells infected with SARS coronavirus. Both phosphorylated IRF3\nand elevated expression of interferon \u03b2 mRNA were detected in cells infected\nwith Sendai virus (Fig. 7, A and\nC). In contrast, although IRF3 was abundantly found in cells\ninfected with SARS coronavirus, neither phosphorylation of IRF3 nor induced expression\nof interferon \u03b2 transcript was observed. These results were consistent with\nprevious findings (4\u201312).\n\nThe formation of TRAF3\u00b7TANK\u00b7TBK1/IKK\u03f5 complex in the\ncytoplasm is an essential step in the activation of IRF3/IRF7 (15\u201317, 34). M protein\nphysically interacted with TBK1/IKK\u03f5 and TRAF3 (Fig. 3). In addition, they also colocalized to the cytoplasmic subdomains\nthat were likely the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 4).\nPlausibly, M protein might impede the formation of a functional\nTRAF3\u00b7TANK\u00b7TBK1/IKK\u03f5 complex by masking the interaction\ndomains or retaining some of the subunits in the Golgi complex. Indeed, when we\nco-expressed TBK1, TRAF3, and M in HEK293 cells, the interaction between TBK1 and\nTRAF3, which was evident in cells expressing TBK1 and TRAF3, was not detected (Fig. 8A, lane 2\ncompared with lane 1). Likewise, the interaction between IKK\u03f5\nand TRAF3 was not observed in M protein-expressing cells (Fig. 8A, lane 4 compared with\nlane 3). Furthermore, the formation of TRAF3-TANK complex was also\nblocked in the presence of M protein (Fig.\n8A, lane 6 compared with lane\n5). Hence, M protein impeded the formation of a functional\nTRAF3\u00b7TANK\u00b7TBK1/IKK\u03f5 complex. Importantly, the formation of\nthis complex was also impaired in SARS coronavirus-infected cells (Fig. 8B). As such, the interaction\nof TRAF3 with TBK1, IKK\u03f5, and TANK was impeded in infected cells where N\nprotein was expressed (Fig. 8B,\nlanes 2, 4, and 6 compared with\nlanes 1, 3, and 5, respectively).\nAlthough the roles of other viral proteins could not be excluded, the same pattern for\nthe impeded formation of TRAF3\u00b7TANK\u00b7TBK1/IKK\u03f5 complex in cells\nexpressing M protein alone and cells infected with SARS coronavirus supported the\nnotion that M protein contributes significantly to the inhibition of type I interferon\nproduction during viral infection.\n\nWe demonstrated in this study that SARS coronavirus M protein inhibited the production of\ntype I interferons through a new mechanism. M protein predominantly localized to the Golgi\ncomplex and potently suppressed dsRNA-induced expression of type I interferon genes (Fig. 1). M protein exerted its inhibitory effect on\ncytoplasmic dsRNA sensors RIG1 and MDA5 as well as other transducer proteins VISA, TBK1, and\nIKK\u03f5, but it could not counteract the activation mediated directly by IRF3 and IRF7\n(Fig. 2). M protein interacted with RIG-I, TBK1,\nIKK\u03f5, and TRAF3 in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3) and\nlikely sequestered some of them in discrete compartments that were consistent with the\nmembrane-associated Golgi apparatus (Fig. 4). Although\nM protein did not directly inhibit the catalytic activity of TBK1/IKK\u03f5 kinase (Fig. 5), it impeded the formation of a functional\nTRAF3\u00b7TANK\u00b7TBK1/IKK\u03f5 complex (Fig.\n8), thereby inhibiting the phosphorylation of IRF3 (Figs. 6 and 7). Importantly, formation of the\nTRAF3\u00b7TANK\u00b7TBK1/IKK\u03f5 complex, phosphorylation of IRF3, and\nproduction of interferon \u03b2 were also inhibited in SARS coronavirus-infected cells\n(Figs. 7 and 8).\n\nOur findings suggested a new role for M protein in pathogenesis of SARS coronavirus. This\nis not surprising a since M protein was previously shown to modulate cellular signaling and\napoptosis (28\u201330). Interestingly, an adaptive mutant\nof M protein was found to enhance viral replication and/or infectivity (27). Because a reduction in interferon-inducing activity\nwas shown to be associated with M protein mutations in transmissible gastroenteritis virus\n(26), M protein of SARS coronavirus might also\ninfluence viral replication through inhibition of interferon production. Thus, it will be of\ngreat interest to understand whether the particular mutation in SARS coronavirus M protein\nmight influence its ability to inhibit the induction of type I interferons. A better\nunderstanding of the role of M protein in pathogenesis of SARS has important implications in\nthe development of new antivirals and vaccines.\n\nOther SARS coronaviral proteins including ORF3b, ORF6, N, nsp1, and papain-like protease\nwere also known to inhibit interferon production and/or signaling (6\u201312). However, their modes of action were\nthought to be different from that of M protein. Particularly, our detailed comparison of M\nand N proteins in their inhibition of various activators (Figs. 1 and 2) suggested that they targeted\ndifferent steps. Although the requirement of M protein for virion assembly prevents us from\nstudying interferon production with M protein deletion mutants of SARS coronavirus, the\ncoordinated actions of different interferon-antagonizing viral proteins in infected cells\nmerit further investigations. This also poses major technical challenges for future attempts\nto verify and distinguish the contributions from different viral proteins during infection.\nIdentification of M protein mutants lacking the interferon-antagonizing activity alone might\nprove useful in future studies.\n\nViral countermeasures for interferon production and signaling have been well described\n(17). Compared with influenza A virus NS1 protein,\nan extensively studied viral antagonist of interferon (48\u201351), SARS coronavirus M protein displayed a similar\npattern of inhibitory activity on RIG-1, MDA5, TBK1, and IKK\u03f5 (Fig. 2). However, M protein inhibited the activity of VISA, whereas NS1\ndid not (Fig. 2E). Additional\nexperiments are required to elucidate the underlying cause of this difference between M and\nNS1 proteins. Both TRAF3 and TANK are known to be important for interferon response (34, 52, 53). Our findings that M protein associated with TRAF3\n(Fig. 3) and impeded its interaction with TANK, TBK1,\nand IKK\u03f5 (Fig. 7) revealed a new mechanism for\nmodulation of interferon production by SARS coronavirus. In this regard, NY-1 hantavirus Gn\ncytoplasmic tail was recently shown to co-precipitate with TRAF3 and inhibit the formation\nof TRAF3-TBK1 complex (54), whereas Ebola virus VP35\nwas able to impair the function of TBK1/IKK\u03f5 by preventing their interaction with\nVISA and IRF3/IRF7 (55). Plausibly, inhibition of the\nformation of a functional TRAF3-TBK1/IKK\u03f5-IRF3/IRF7 complex might be a common\nmechanism through which viruses inhibit interferon production.\n\nCytoplasmic modulators of interferon induction have just begun to be understood. Whereas\nNLRX1 and MULAN are mitochondrial proteins that interact with VISA to inhibit RIG-I activity\n(56, 57),\nDDX3X interacts with TBK1 directly (58) and is\ntargeted by vaccinia virus K7 protein (59). In this\nconnection, our demonstration of a coronaviral inhibitor of interferon production not only\nadds a new member to the group of viral and cellular modulators of interferon response but\nmight also reveal new targets and strategies in the design of new antiviral agents."}
