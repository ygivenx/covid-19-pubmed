{"title": "High-throughput virtual screening and docking studies of matrix protein vp40 of ebola virus", "body": "The increased threat of terrorism necessitates an evaluation of\nthe risk posed by various microorganisms as biological\nweapons. Especially, Filoviruses is one of such important\nmicroorganisms. Ebola virus and Marburg virus are category A\nbioweapon organisms. Biowarfare agents are considered as\npotential biological weapons because they pose a threat as\nlethal pathogens and because their use by terrorists might result\nin extreme fear and panic [1,\n2].\n\nThe attraction for bioweapons in war and for use in terroristic\nattacks is attributed to their low production costs, the easy\naccess to a wide range of disease-producing biological agents,\ntheir non-detection by routine security systems and their easy\ntransportation from one location to another [3]. Biological\nweapons pose the most significant terrorism threat. They are\nrelatively easy to produce and could result in deaths\ncomparable to nuclear weapons [4].\n\nEbola hemorrhagic fever is an acute viral syndrome that leads\nto fever and an ensuing bleeding diathesis that is marked by\nhigh mortality in human and nonhuman primates. It is caused\nby Ebola virus, a lipid-enveloped, negative strand RNA virus\nthat belongs to the viral family Filoviridae [5]. Case fatalities\nrange historically between 53 and 90% [6].\n\nEbola virus infection in human causes severe disease for which\nthere is presently no vaccine or other treatment [7]. Vaccination\nstrategies based on single or multiple filovirus proteins have\nexamined the protective capacity of Glycoprotein (GP) alone \n[8\u201315] \nor in association with Nucleoprotein (NP) or Viral protein\n(VP) [16\u201318]. \nThe vaccine potential of other internal structural\nproteins has been investigated as well. VP24, VP30, and VP35,\nexpressed by using recombinant venezuelan equine encephalitis\nvectors, elicit some immunological response in rodents, but no\nsingle VP could confer complete defence against lethal Ebola\nvirus and Marburg virus challenges [19,\n20].\n\nVP40 plays an important role in virus assembly and budding,\nVP40 is the most abundant protein in viral particles; it is located\nunder the viral bilayer to make structural integrity of the\nparticles. VP40 matrix protein assembles and budding process\ntake place at the plasma membrane, which requires lipid raft\nmicro domains [21,\n22]. VP40 is active not only in the lipid\nbilayer during the assembly process but also plays an important\nrole either in viral or host cell RNA metabolism during its\nreplication [23]. C-terminal domain of VP40 is required for\nmembrane association [24,\n25].\n\nCrystal structure of VP40 is an octamer, forms a pore-like\nstructure and binding with RNA. The protein-RNA interface is\nstabilized by 140 amino acids residues of VP40 (including\nThr123, Phe125 and Arg134 amino acid residues of a fragment\nof N-terminal domain) and UGA of RNA. The monomeric\nstructure having two domains, N-terminal and C-terminal\ndomains are involved in membrane association. RNA binding\npocket could serve as a target for antiviral drug development\n[23].\n\nMatrix protein and Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) interactions have\nbeen reported for a number of enveloped viruses \n[26\u201329]. Matrix\nprotein interacts with RNA in Thr123, Phe125 and Arg134\nresidues; these are the most important residues close to the\ninterface of the N- and C-terminal domains in the monomeric\nconformation; which might implicate them in the transition\nprocess. VP40 octameric structure shows that the interfaces of\nthe dimeric subunit are similar to the interface occupied by the\nN-and C-terminal domains in the closed conformation \n[30]. The\naim of this study was to identify potential lead compounds\nagainst VP40 protein target using high throughput virtual\nscreening and molecular docking approaches and subjecting the\nidentified molecules for ADME analysis.\n\nX-ray crystal structure of the matrix protein VP40 at 1.6 \u00c5\nresolution was retrieved from Protein Data Bank (PDB ID:\n1H2C) [33]. Protein preparation wizard was used in\nSchrodinger 2010. All the water molecules and RNA were\nremoved from the original crystal structure before protein\npreparation process, to analyse the structure and the bond\norder assigned, hydrogen atoms were added and the geometry\nof all the hetero groups were corrected. Hydrogen bonds\nassignment tool was used to optimize the hydrogen bond\nnetwork. Finally, impref optimized the position of hydrogen\nbonds and keeping all the atoms in place. Energy minimization\nwas carried out using default constraint of the 0.3 \u00c5 of RMSD\nand the OPLS_2005 force field.\n\nGrids were generated by Receptor Grid Generation panel which\ndefines receptor structure by excluding any other cocrystallized\nligand that may be present, settle on the position\nand size of the active site was represented by receptor grids.\nGrid point's level for x, y, z axis (3.68, 19.15, 25.87) with in the\ngrid parameters Thr123, Phe125 & Arg134 amino acid residues\nwere present and grid generation was performed using\nOPLS_2005.\n\nTraditional Chinese medicine (TCM) database contains more\nthan one lakh of compounds and Asinex database contains\n202122 structures, assembled from the collection of 1115000\nAsinex platinum compounds. Single low energy conformation\nis stored for each of the 202122 database entries. 3D database\nentries were created following AsinexDB_Pt_flex,\nAsinexDB_flex and AsinexDB - Lipinski-filtered were cleaned\nusing LigPrep, with expansion of stereo centers whose chirality\nwas unspecified. This small molecules collection contains a high\npercentage of drug like compounds [34,\n35].\n\nVirtual screening is the easiest method to identify and rank\npotential drug candidates from a database of compounds.\nBased on the active site of VP40, high throughput virtual\nscreening was performed using the Traditional Chinese\nmedicine and Asinex compound database. The compounds\nwere subjected to Glide based three-tiered docking strategy in\nwhich all the compounds were docked by three stages of the\ndocking protocol, High Throughput Virtual Screening (HTVS),\nStandard Precision (SP) and Extra precision (XP). First stage of\nHTVS docking screens the ligands that are retrieved and all the\nscreened compounds are passed on to the second stage of SP\ndocking. The SP resultant compounds were then docked using\nmore accurate and computationally intensive XP mode. Based\non the glide score and glide energy, the protocol gives the leads\nin XP descriptor. Glide module of the XP visualizer analyses the\nspecific interactions. Glide includes ligand-protein interaction\nenergies, hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, internal\nenergy, \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions and root mean square\ndeviation (RMSD) and desolvation.\n\nADME properties were calculated using molsoft [36]. Molsoft\npredicts two properties, physically significant and\npharmaceutically relevant descriptors. Molsoft program will\npredict the properties of the molecules, with a detailed analysis\nof principal descriptors and physiochemical properties. It also\nevaluates the acceptability of the analogues based on Lipinski's\nrule of 5 [37], which are essential for drug-like pharmacokinetic\nprofile while using rational drug design.\n\nDocking results showed that the ligand ASN03576800 occupied\nthe RNA binding region of VP40 with a Glide score of -7.66 and\nthe Glide energy is -31.88 Kcal/mol. Two hydrogen bond\ninteractions were identified with the backbone amino acid\nresidue Ala156 and side chain amino acid residues Arg134 and\nArg148. Phe157 was involved in the \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction\nwith ligand. Four hydrophobic interactions with the amino acid\nresidues Pro97, Leu98, Ile152, Phe161 and one polar interaction\nwith the amino acid residue Gln155 in the RNA binding region\nof VP40 were observed (Figure 3).\n\nThe ligand ASN06396768 occupied the RNA binding region of\nVP40 with a Glide score of -7.46 and the Glide energy is -40.64\nKcal/mol. Hydrogen bond interactions were identified with the\nbackbone amino acid residue Gly126 and side chain amino acid\nresidues Gln170 and Tyr171. Two hydrophobic interactions\nwith the amino acid residues Pro131 and Ala128, and two\npositive charge interactions with Lys127 and His124 residues\nwere observed (Figure 3).\n\nDocking results showed that the ligand ASN05439185 occupied\nthe RNA binding region of VP40 with a Glide score of -7.39 and\nthe Glide energy is -44.72 Kcal/mol. Two hydrogen bond\ninteractions were identified with the backbone amino acid\nresidue Gly126 and side chain amino acid residue Gln170.\nPro131 and Tyr171 involved in the \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction with\nthe ligand. Four hydrophobic interactions with the amino acid\nresidues Phe125, Ala128, Leu132 and Phe172 formed and polar\ninteractions with the residues Thr123, Thr173 and Gln167.\nHis124 and Lys127 formed positive charge interaction with\nligand were observed (Figure 3).\n\nThe ligand ASN08735135 occupied the RNA binding region of\nVP40 with a Glide score of -7.11 and the Glide energy is -33.52\nKcal/mol. Two hydrogen bond interactions were identified\nwith the backbone amino acid residue Gly126 and side chain\namino acid residue Gln170. Tyr171 was involved in the \u03c0-\u03c0\nstacking interaction with the ligand. Phe125, Ala128, Pro131\nand Leu132 formed hydrophobic interactions. His124 and\nLys127 formed positive charge interactions with the ligand\n(Figure 3).\n\nThe ligand ASN08745583 occupied the RNA binding region of\nVP40 with a Glide score of -6.95 and the Glide energy is -42.55\nKcal/mol. Two hydrogen bond interactions were identified\nwith the backbone amino acid residue Gly126 and side chain\namino acid residues Gln170 and Tyr171. Pro131 was involved in\nthe \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction with the ligand. Five hydrophobic\ninteractions with the amino acid residues Pro125, Ala128,\nLeu132, Leu168 and Pro169 were observed. Thr123 and Gln167\nformed polar interactions and His124 and Lys127 formed the\npositive charge interactions with the ligand (Figure 3).\n\nDocking results showed that the ligand 693 occupied the RNA\nbinding region of VP40 with a Glide score of -6.07 and the Glide\nenergy is -24.52 Kcal/mol. Five hydrogen bond interactions\nwere identified with the backbone amino acid residue His124,\nPhe172 and side chain amino acid residue Thr123, Thr173.\nPhe125 and Tyr171 involved in the hydrophobic interaction\nwith the ligand were observed (Figure 3).\n\nThe ligand 234 occupied the RNA binding region of VP40 with\na Glide score of -5.30 and the Glide energy is -35.27 Kcal/mol.\nOne hydrogen bond interaction was identified with the side\nchain amino acid residue Thr173. Tyr171 was involved in the \u03c0-\n\u03c0 stacking interaction with the ligand. Four hydrophobic\ninteractions with the amino acid residues Phe125, Ala128,\nPro131 and Phe172 were observed. Thr123, His124 and Gln170\nformed polar interactions and Lys127 formed the positive\ncharge interactions with the ligand (Figure 3).\n\nThe Ebola virus matrix protein VP40 associates with the\nassembly and budding process of enveloped viruses. VP40\ncontains two short sequence motifs (PPXY and PTAP) at its Nterminus\nwhose presence have been implicated in virus particle\nrelease by interacting with cellular factors [23]. Matrix\nprotein/RNP interactions have been reported for a number of\nenveloped viruses [26\u201329]. \nThis process may generally involve\ninteractions with viral RNA, such as corona virus M/mRNA1\nrecognition, which seems to be crucial for the M-NP association\n[39]. In addition, other studies implicated that the matrix\nproteins interfere with the cellular RNA metabolism [40,\n41].\nThe dimer interface is stabilized by the interaction with ssRNA\nsegment. The RNA mainly interacts with Arg134, Phe125 [23].\nArg134, Phe125 are the most important residues in the\ninteraction and both are positioned next to each other and\nexposed close to the interface of the N-terminal domains in the\nmonomeric conformation it might play them in the transition\nprocess. VP40 is a monomer in solution and it is containing two\ndomains [30] and interaction with cellular budding factors \n[42\u201344] \nwith C-terminal domain is instrumental for membrane\nassociation [25].\n\nThe compound FGI106, (Quino[8,7-h]quinoline-\n1,7diamine,N,N-bis[3-(dimethylamino) propyl]-3,9-dimethyltetrahydrochloride)\nis reported as an inhibitor of Ebola virus\nreplication without its specificity towards any of the potent\ntarget proteins [45,\n46]. Ribavirins, which function as host and\nvirus proteins, aryl methyldiene rhodanine derivative, termed\n\u201cLJ001\u201d, LJ001 intercalates into lipid bilayers, probably via the\nphenyl ring on its nonpolar end and positions the\npharmacophore on the opposite polar end for activity. It is\npossible that an activation of the thioxo functionality occurs to\ncause damage in the lipid environment of the virus or cell. The\nactual efficacy of LJ001 for the prophylactic, postexposure, or\ntherapeutic treatment of enveloped viral diseases probably will\ndepend on formulation and pharmacological considerations as\nwell as on the pathogenic profile of the virus [47]. SAH\nhydrolase inhibitor is to boost the immune response by\nstimulating interferon production. SAH inhibitors induced IFN-\n\u03b1 given immediately reduce the Ebola and Zaire resulted only in\na 2-day in the onset of illness and death [48]. Cyanovirin-N\n(CV-N) is a protein that is produced by cyanobacteria and it\nbinds to high-mannose oligosaccharides, treatment for 6 days\ndelayed the onset of illness and prolonged the time of survival \u2013\nhowever, it failed to protect mice from death [49].\n\nPhysically significant descriptors and pharmaceutically relevant\nproperties of the ten lead compounds were analyzed using\nmolsoft. Molecular weight, log P Octanol/water partition\ncoefficient, H-bond donors, H-bond acceptors, Mol Log S and\ntheir positions according to Lipinski's rule of five were included\nas significant descriptors Table 1 (see supplementary material).\nThe ten selected compounds were in the acceptable range of\nLipinski's rule of five, indicating their potential for use as druglike\nmolecules [37].\n\nSince, no potent inhibitors are available against Ebola virus,\nmolecular docking studies were performed to identify small\nmolecule inhibitors of the lipid bilayer interaction during the\nviral assembly and budding process. HTVS screened\ncompounds from ASINEX and TCM database were subjected to\nSP docking which resulted in 159 compounds. These\ncompounds were further taken for XP docking. Using XP\ndocking, based on the glide score, glide energy and H-bond\ninteractions with the amino acid residues of RNA binding site,\n10 compounds were shortlisted. ADME properties test of the hit\nmolecules indicated that all the 10 compounds were within the\nacceptable range of Lipinski's Rule of Five. This suggests that\nthe ten compounds could be potential inhibitors of the VP40\nmatrix protein. Out of the ten compounds, ASN03576800 (2-[2-\n(1,3-benzodioxol-5-ylamino)-2-oxoethyl]sulfinylacetic acid) has\na good glide score and glide energy (-7.46 & -50.30 kcal/mol).\nThe ligand has a good contact with the specific amino acid\nresidue Arg134 and other residues like Gly126 and Thr173 with\nthe hydrogen bond distances of 2.0, 1.9 and 2.1 \u00c5. The ligand\nASN03576800 could be a potent inhibitor for Ebola virus matrix\nprotein VP40 in process of viral assembly and budding process."}
