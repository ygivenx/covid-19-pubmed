{"title": "Title: Severe outcomes associated with respiratory viruses in newborns and infants: a prospective viral surveillance study in Jordan Correspondence to", "body": "\u2022 This three-year prospective surveillance study uses real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to test a cohort of over 3000 children for 11 major respiratory viruses.\n\nTo our knowledge, this study is the first to report virus-specific hospitalization rates and illness severity in Jordanian children hospitalized with acute respiratory infections (ARI).\n\nWe fit a multivariable logistic model to analyze the risk factors for severe illness, and used a Bayesian hierarchical model to derive the population prevalence of each respiratory virus.\n\nThis study is limited to children from low-and middle-income population, potentially underestimating the true burden of ARI in Jordan. Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are the leading cause of death beyond the neonatal period in children under five years of age worldwide. 1 Historically, bacterial pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type B have been noted as predominant etiologies; 1-3 however, respiratory viruses are frequently implicated as primary causes as well. A recent study conducted in the U.S. found that respiratory viruses were much more common in children hospitalized with pneumonia than bacteria, with at least one virus detected in 65% of enrolled children. 4 A multicenter study conducted in four developing countries also noted that even though Streptococcus pneumonia was associated with increased risk of pneumonia deaths, respiratory viruses were frequently associated with severe, hypoxic pneumonia. 5, 6 Earlier studies have estimated that there were 66,000-199,000 RSV-related deaths in 2005 and 28,000-111,5000 influenza-related deaths in 2008 in children under five, however, these systematic reviews did not include countries in the Middle East due to paucity of population-based studies in the region. 7, 8 The seasonality of respiratory viral diseases other than RSV and influenza and their overall burden in in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) also remain poorly defined. 9 Additionally, prior published viral surveillance studies from the region have been limited by their retrospective nature, the use of convenience samples over short time periods, and the lack of use of modern molecular techniques such as real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). 10, 11 Thus, the true burden and severity of virus-driven ARIs in Middle Eastern children are less defined.\n\nWe conducted a prospective surveillance study that tracked ARI-associated hospitalizations over a three-year period among Jordanian children. The objectives of this study were to estimate virus-specific hospitalization rates, identify risk factors for illness severity, and characterize seasonal variations of respiratory viral infections in Jordan.\n\nIn this prospective surveillance study, we enrolled children under two years old who were hospitalized with fever and/or respiratory symptoms between March 16, 2010 and March 31, 2013 at Al-Bashir Hospital in Amman, Jordan (detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria previously reported). 12 Subjects were recruited five days a week (Sunday through Thursday) within 48 hours of hospital admission. 12 Children with chemotherapyassociated neutropenia and newborns who had never been discharged after birth were excluded from the study.\n\nThe institutional review boards at the University of Jordan, the Jordanian Ministry of Health, and Vanderbilt University approved the study. Written informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians. a in year t. The sampled population \u074a ,\u0be7 was similarly estimated from a binomial model that sampled from \u0730 ,\u0be7 the total Amman population of age a in year t:\n\nHere, \u07e8 is the proportion of the Amman population that is eligible to be sampled, which accounts for the market share \u0749 and the sampling intensity (5 days out of 7):\n\nThe market share for Al-Bashir Hospital was modeled as a random variable, and given a uniform prior distribution between 50% and 60%, based on prior information. Prevalence was given diffuse beta(1,5) priors for all models. Note that the model structure implies all individuals carrying the virus in question seek hospital care.\n\nData sharing statement: Technical appendix, statistical code, and dataset available upon request with proper ethical approval.\n\nFrom March 16, 2010 through March 31, 2013, we screened and confirmed eligibility for 3793 patients. Of the 3793 patients, 618 had parent/guardian refusal, three were determined to be ineligible after enrollment due to age, and four were diagnosed with meningitis. Our final sample consisted of 3168 subjects.\n\nThe median age was 3.5 months, (range 0.07-23.96 months), 60% were male, 12% had UMCs, and 14% were premature (<37 weeks gestation) (table 1) . Of the 375 subjects with UMCs, heart disease was the most common, 146/357 (39%). Nearly 90% of the children's parents self-identified as Jordanian, and 7% reported Palestinian as their nationality. Primary and secondary education was the highest attainment in 41% and 44% of the mothers respectively. The median birth weight was 3.0 kg, and 28% were born by cesarean section. The median number of siblings was two, 1.6% attended daycare, and 77% were exposed to smoke (73% and 18% to cigarette and hookah, respectively).\n\nPrior to hospitalization, 41% of the children had received antibiotics, and 92% were administered an antibiotic during their hospital stay (table 1) . The seven main admission diagnoses included: bronchopneumonia (32%), suspected sepsis (28%), bronchiolitis (17%), pneumonia (12%), pertussis-like cough (7%), asthma/reactive airway disease (5%), and febrile seizure (3%). The median length of stay was 5 days, with 9% admitted to the ICU, 4% on MV, and 32% receiving oxygen therapy ( 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   6 AdV cases. Figure 1B shows the viral distribution by age, with viral co-detection common in all age groups. The percentage of viral detection by admission diagnoses are displayed in Figure 1C . The frequency and distribution of all viruses over the three-year period is displayed in Figure 2 , with >95% viral detection in the winter months, predominately RSV.\n\nOf our 3168 subjects, 3048 (96.2%) resided in Amman. The highest rates of hospitalization were due to RSV in years one (7.8 per 1000 children) and two (8.4 per 1,000 children) and HRV in year 3 (9.6 per 1,000). Hospitalization rates were higher in children under six months old for all viruses compared to the older age groups, and those who were 6-11 months had higher rates compared to 12-23 months, based on nonoverlapping credible intervals (figure 3).\n\nVirus-positive children were significantly more likely to require oxygen therapy (34% vs 23%, p<0.001) and receive an antibiotic prior to admission (43% vs 32%, p<0.001) ( 1) . RSV-positive subjects significantly were less likely to present with fever and more likely to present with cough, shortness of breath, and have flaring on exam compared to HRV, AdV, PIV, and Flu-positive children (supplemental figure 1) . RSV-positive subjects significantly were less likely to have seizures/convulsions but more likely to have wheezing on exam compared to HRV and AdV-positive children (supplemental figure 1). RSV-positive subjects significantly were less likely to present with diarrhea but more likely to have cyanosis on exam compared to HRV, Flu, and AdV-positive children (supplemental figure 1). pneumonia or suspected sepsis were all associated with death, while bronchiolitis or bronchopneumonia were less likely to be associated with death (table 2) .\n\nOur study revealed that respiratory viruses are the predominant pathogens among young hospitalized children who present with fever and/or respiratory symptoms in Amman, Jordan. The most common diagnoses were bronchopneumonia, suspected sepsis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and pertussis-like cough. Only one-fifth of the children enrolled had no virus detected. Consistently, during each of the three winter seasons, ~95% of children hospitalized during winter months tested positive for a virus, with RSV and HRV being the most common viruses identified. Both RSV and HRV rates were higher than expected compared to US-based studies. 17, 22, 23 Specifically, RSV rates were similar to rates from Turkey, Norway, and Austria 24-28 ; higher than the US and Netherlands; 22, 29 and lower than UK, Spain, and Denmark. [30] [31] [32] [33] Rates of influenza, HMPV, and PIV1-3 in our cohort were similar to US reports [34] [35] [36] [37] . Our estimates of the burden of influenza, HRV, HMPV, PIV 1-3, and RSV fill a gap in knowledge from the Middle East. 7, 8 Hospitalized children who were virus-negative were more likely to be younger, febrile, and symptomatic with non-respiratory symptoms. Moreover, the overall illness severity of virus-negative children was greater than those with a confirmed viral cause, with more frequent suspected sepsis, seizures, ICU admission, and/or mortality. In contrast, virus-positive children were more likely to present with severe lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) as indicated by higher frequency of cough and shortness of breath, wheezing, flaring, and cyanosis on exam, and increased oxygen therapy requirement. These clinical differences were dramatic, and may serve as helpful clinical predictors of likely viral diagnosis prior to the availability of more definitive laboratory findings. In addition, 68% of the children who died had at least one respiratory virus detected, noting the association of severe disease with viral detection in these children. Since antibiotic use was nearly universal in children with positive detection of respiratory viruses, targeted interventions for antibiotic stewardship may also be warranted.\n\nSince RSV was the most common virus detected, we compared the clinical presentations of RSV only to single detection of other respiratory viruses. RSV only children were more likely to present with cough and shortness of breath; have flaring, wheezing, and cyanosis on physical exam; and less likely to present with fever, diarrhea, and seizures compared to other respiratory viruses. Interestingly, the clinical presentations of RSV and HMPV were indistinguishable, other than age: HMPV only children were older. A surveillance study of RSV-positive children in India found the presence of cough, fast-breathing, crepitation, and hypoxia to be independent predictors of RSV infection. 38 Durani et al. found the combination of cough, wheezing, and retractions to be good predictors of RSV infection. 38, 39 Our study also found cough to be a strong predictor for the presence of virus, including RSV. In addition, the RSV-positive children in our study were more likely to require oxygen therapy, suggesting these children presented with more severe LRT disease. We also documented RSV being more severe than other viruses in a previous pilot study. 14 Therefore, if preventive measures such as vaccines become available for RSV, Jordanian children would benefit greatly.\n\nWe examined independent risk factors for several measures of illness severity: LOS, oxygen therapy, ICU admission, MV, and death. Universally, younger age, UMC, and the diagnosis of pneumonia were associated with all five illness severity markers. Lack of breastfeeding was associated with all severity markers except for MV. Therefore, the promotion of breastfeeding is an important public health intervention for reducing the severity of respiratory illnesses. Our study found that lower vitamin D levels were associated with longer LOS and higher probability of oxygen use. Two studies identified an association between lower infant vitamin D levels and increased risk of ARI, and one study found lower levels of vitamin D in children admitted into the ICU with bronchiolitis or pneumonia compared to those admitted to the wards. [40] [41] [42] Observational evidence supports further interventional studies to determine if vitamin D supplementation could reduce respiratory illness severity in this population. A principal strength of our study was its basis of over three full years of surveillance data from a public hospital serving the poor and lower middle class children of a large city in the Middle East North Africa (MENA) region. Prior to this study, very few large prospective studies of respiratory viral diseases of children have been completed in this setting. Our ongoing surveillance enabled us to test samples during the time of the first MERS-CoV outbreak in 2012, confirming that none of the children in this study were admitted with MERS-CoV. 43 Our state-of-the-art molecular diagnostics give one of the best assessments to date of respiratory viral etiologies of hospitalized children in any MENA nation. Limitations included having only five days of surveillance per week, though we did weighted analysis in our population burden estimates to adjust for missing days. Also, we did not test for all respiratory viruses (e.g., parainfluenza 4, non-MERS coronaviruses), so viral burden is underestimated. Lastly, this study is limited to children from low-and middle-income population, and thus is not generalizable to the entire population of Jordan.\n\nRespiratory viral burden is likely to be substantial for the entire MENA region. 7 Prevention strategies such as breastfeeding promotion, vitamin D supplementation, and future RSV vaccines could reduce regional ARI burden. Further studies to include a more generalizable population are needed. Figure 1A . The total number of pathogens detected by individual virus, with co-detection of viral pathogens within each virus.

Children with chemotherapy-associated neutropenia and newborns who had never been discharged after birth were excluded from the study.\n\nOutcome Measures: Hospitalization rates and markers of illness severity: admission to intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation (MV), oxygen therapy, length of stay (LOS), and death. Virus-specific hospitalization rates ranged from 0.5-10.5 per 1000 children.\n\nRespiratory viruses are associated with severe illness in Jordanian children hospitalized with ARI. Prevention strategies such as extended breastfeeding, increased access to palivizumab, and RSV vaccine development could help decrease hospitalization rates and illness severity, particularly in young children with underlying medical conditions.\n\n\u2022 This three-year prospective surveillance study uses real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to test a cohort of over 3000 children for 11 major respiratory viruses.\n\nTo our knowledge, this study is the first to report virus-specific hospitalization rates and illness severity in Jordanian children hospitalized with acute respiratory infections (ARI).\n\nWe fit a multivariable logistic model to analyze the risk factors for severe illness, and used a Bayesian hierarchical model to derive the population prevalence of each respiratory virus.\n\nThis study is limited to children from low-and middle-income population seeking care at a single government hospital, potentially underestimating the true burden of ARI in Jordan. \n\nAcute respiratory infections (ARI) are the leading cause of death beyond the neonatal period in children under five years of age worldwide. 1 Historically, bacterial pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type B have been noted as predominant etiologies; 1-3 however, respiratory viruses are frequently implicated as primary causes as well.

Written informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians.\n\nAl-Bashir Hospital is one of the three major government hospitals in Amman, which is Jordan's largest city and capital. 12 We estimate that during the study period, the hospital provided care for \u224855% of all children in Amman (author SF, unpublished data). Additionally, the pediatric wards admitted 17,557 children, 11,230 (64%) of whom were under two years of age.\n\nAfter consent, trained local research staff obtained blood either by heel stick or venipuncture, as well as nasal and throat swabs. Standardized questionnaires were used to record demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic data. Parents were queried in Arabic, and bilingual research staff transcribed the information into an Englishlanguage case report form at the time of the interview. After discharge, charts were abstracted for the following: antibiotic use, blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures, chest radiography, oxygen use, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, mechanical ventilation (MV), length of stay (LOS) in the hospital, and discharge status. All data were entered into a standardized, secure REDCap\u2122 (Research Electronic Data Capture, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA) database. 13 We performed data quality checks on a minimum of 10% of the charts and verified data from all case report forms after entry.\n\nAdmission to ICU, oxygen therapy, MV placement, LOS, and death were considered markers of severe illness. ICU admission included children who were transferred in during their hospital stay or were admitted directly. 19, 20 Models were run for 100,000 iterations, with the first 90,000 iterations conservatively discarded as burn-in. Models were checked for convergence using the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic. 21, 22 Rate Calculation Al-Bashir Hospital admissions data were used to estimate the population prevalence of each respiratory virus. These data were filtered to exclude admissions of individuals not residing in greater Amman. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to derive estimates for each of the three years of the study. 21 Estimates of the under 2-year-old Jordanian population were obtained from the World Bank online database, and the proportion of the population residing in Amman (35%) was taken from the 2012 national census. These values were used in a binomial model to estimate the population of children <2 years of age in greater Amman in 2010-2012. A binomial data likelihood was specified:\n\nwhere \u202b\u0755\u202c ,\u0be7 \u0be9 is the number of children of age a in year t at Al-Bashir observed with virus v, while \u074a ,\u0be7 is the population of children age a in year t eligible for sampling, and \u202b\u202c \u0be9 the prevalence of virus v among children age a in year t. The sampled population \u074a ,\u0be7 was similarly estimated from a binomial model that sampled from \u0730 ,\u0be7 the total Amman population of age a in year t:\n\nHere, \u07e8 is the proportion of the Amman population that is eligible to be sampled, which accounts for the market share \u0749 and the sampling intensity (5 days out of 7):\n\nThe market share for Al-Bashir Hospital was modeled as a random variable, and given a uniform prior distribution between 50% and 60%, based on prior information. Prevalence was given diffuse beta(1,5) priors for all models. Note that the model structure implies all individuals carrying the virus in question seek hospital care.\n\nData sharing statement: Technical appendix, statistical code, and dataset available upon request with proper ethical approval.\n\nPatient and Public Involvement: were not involved in this study design or input.\n\nFrom March 16, 2010 through March 31, 2013, we screened and confirmed eligibility for 3793 patients. Of the 3793 patients, 618 had parent/guardian refusal, three were determined to be ineligible after enrollment due to age, and four were diagnosed with meningitis. Our final sample consisted of 3168 subjects.\n\nThe median age was 3.5 months, (range 0.07-23.96 months), 60% were male, 12% had UMCs, and 14% were premature (<37 weeks gestation) (table 1) . Of the 375 subjects with UMCs, heart disease was the most common, 146/357 (39%). Nearly 90% of the children's parents self-identified as Jordanian, and 7% reported Palestinian as their nationality. Primary and secondary education was the highest attainment in 41% and 44% of the mothers respectively. The median birth weight was 3.0 kg, and 28% were born by cesarean section. The median number of siblings was two, 1.6% attended daycare, and 77% were exposed to smoke (73% and 18% to cigarette and hookah, respectively).\n\nBefore hospitalization, 41% of the children had received antibiotics, and 92% were administered an antibiotic during their hospital stay (table 1) . The seven main admission diagnoses included: bronchopneumonia (32%), suspected sepsis (28%), bronchiolitis (17%), pneumonia (12%), pertussis-like cough (7%), asthma/reactive airway disease (5%), and febrile seizure (3%). The median length of stay was five days, with 9% admitted to the ICU, 4% on MV, and 32% receiving oxygen therapy (table 1) . Of the 2688 (85%) subjects who were tested for vitamin D levels, 49% had vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/mL). The median level was 16.5 ng/mL (IQR 5.2, 26) (table 1) . During the study period, 31 (1%) children died (table 1) Figure 1B shows the viral distribution by age, with viral co-detection common in all age groups. The percentage of viral detection by admission diagnoses are displayed in Figure 1C . The frequency and distribution of all viruses over the three-year period are displayed in Figure 2 , with >95% viral detection in the winter months, predominately RSV.\n\nReports of blood, urine, and CSF cultures were available for 764, 769, and 614 subjects respectively. Of these subjects, 38/764 (5.0%) had positive blood cultures, 118/769 (15.3%) had positive urine cultures, and 4/614 (0.7%) had positive CSF cultures. Of the 150 subjects who tested positive for at least one bacterial culture, 104 (69.3%) also had viral co-detection.\n\nOf our 3168 subjects, 3048 (96.2%) resided in Amman. The highest rates of hospitalization were due to RSV in years one (7.8 per 1000 children) and two (8.4 per 1,000 children) and HRV in year 3 (9.6 per 1,000). Hospitalization rates were higher in children under six months old for all viruses compared to the older age groups, and those who were 6-11 months had higher rates compared to 12-23 months, based on nonoverlapping credible intervals ( figure 3) .\n\nVirus-positive children were significantly more likely to require oxygen therapy (34% vs 23%, p<0.001) and receive an antibiotic prior to admission (43% vs 32%, p<0.001) ( 1) . RSV only subjects were also significantly less likely to present with fever and more likely to present with a cough, shortness of breath, and have flaring on exam compared to HRV, AdV, PIV, and Flu-only children (supplemental figure 1) . RSV only subjects significantly were less likely to have seizures/convulsions but more likely to have wheezing on exam compared to HRV only and AdV only children (supplemental figure 1) . RSV only subjects significantly were less likely to present with diarrhea but more likely to have cyanosis on exam compared to HRV only, Flu only, and AdV only children (supplemental figure 1) . 2) . The number of deaths was too low to support a multivariable analysis. However, in a univariate model, younger age, lack of breast feeding, underlying medical condition, virus negativity, and diagnoses of pneumonia or suspected sepsis were all associated with death, while bronchiolitis or bronchopneumonia was less likely to be associated with death (table 2) .\n\nOur study revealed that respiratory viruses are the predominant pathogens among young hospitalized children who present with fever and/or respiratory symptoms in Amman, Jordan. The most common diagnoses were bronchopneumonia, suspected sepsis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and pertussis-like cough. Only one-fifth of the children enrolled had no virus detected. Consistently, during each of the three winter seasons, ~95% of children hospitalized during winter months tested positive for a virus, with RSV and HRV being the most common viruses identified. Both RSV and HRV rates were higher than expected compared to US-based studies. 18, 23, 24 Specifically, RSV rates were similar to rates from Turkey, Norway, and Austria [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] ; higher than the US and Netherlands; 23, 30 and lower than UK, Spain, and Denmark. [31] [32] [33] [34] Rates of influenza, HMPV, and PIV1-3 in our cohort were similar to US reports [35] [36] [37] [38] . Our estimates of the burden of influenza, HRV, HMPV, PIV 1-3, and RSV fill a gap in knowledge from the Middle East. 7, 8 Hospitalized children who were virus-negative were more likely to be younger, febrile, and symptomatic with non-respiratory symptoms. Moreover, the overall illness severity of virus-negative children was greater than those with a confirmed viral cause, with more frequent suspected sepsis, seizures, ICU admission, and/or mortality.

RSV only children were more likely to present with cough and shortness of breath; have flaring, wheezing, and cyanosis on physical exam; and less likely to present with fever, diarrhea, and seizures compared to other respiratory viruses. Interestingly, the clinical presentations of RSV and HMPV were indistinguishable, other than age: HMPV only children were older. A surveillance study of RSV-positive children in India found the presence of cough, fast-breathing, crepitation, and hypoxia to be independent predictors of RSV infection. 39 Durani et al. found the combination of cough, wheezing, and retractions to be good predictors of RSV infection. 39, 40 Our study also found cough to be a strong predictor of the presence of virus, including RSV.

Limitations included having only five days of surveillance per week, though we did weighted analysis in our population burden estimates to adjust for missing days. Also, we did not test for all respiratory viruses (e.g., parainfluenza 4, non-MERS coronaviruses), so the viral burden is underestimated. Lastly, this study is limited to children from low-and middle-income population seeking care at a single health facility in Amman, and thus is not generalizable to the entire population of Jordan.\n\nThe respiratory viral burden is likely to be substantial for the entire MENA region. 7 Prevention strategies such as breastfeeding promotion, vitamin D supplementation, and future RSV vaccines could reduce regional ARI burden. Further studies that include groups representing the broader population in Jordan are needed. Figure 1A .
