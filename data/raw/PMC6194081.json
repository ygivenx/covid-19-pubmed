{"title": "Blood immune transcriptome analysis of artificially fed dairy calves and naturally suckled beef calves from birth to 7 days of age", "body": "New-born calves are immunologically na\u00efve at birth, offering the ideal scenario to observe the development of immunocompetence through time. The protection of the womb environment during the pre-partum period, coupled with syndesmochorial placentation, results in a lack of experience to pathogens, meaning that calves are born with an essentially non-functional immune response1. Development of immunocompetence in calves relies on successful absorption of maternal colostrum derived immunoglobulins, which in turn is dependent upon successful colostrum management. The importance of colostrum-derived passive immunity, through intestinal absorption of colostral immunoglobulins, to the mortality, morbidity, and subsequent growth and welfare of a newborn calf is recognised internationally2\u20135. Consequently, colostrum feeding management is of critical importance to the health and vitality of the calf, in order to confer protection from the various septicemic and enteric diseases that they are susceptible to in early life2. Failure of passive transfer of colostrum derived IgGs (FPT, serum IgG < 10 mg/mL) markedly increases morbidity and mortality in calves3\u20135. There is tremendous variation in the passive immune status of dairy calves3,6\u20138 and, generally passive immunity of dairy calves is much lower than beef calves7. This difference is primarily attributed to differences in colostrum Ig levels, whereby dairy cows produce relatively large volumes of colostrum with relatively low concentrations of Ig while beef cows produce the opposite3,9,10. In the suckled beef calf, there are also large differences in passive immunity between cow breed types3,8.\n\nThe use of a systems approach such as RNA sequencing offers advantages over other molecular based techniques such as microarray, enabling unbiased opportunities towards the profiling of developing immunocompetence using a global unbiased view of relative transcriptomic alterations11. Peripheral whole blood samples are commonly used for immunological studies as they are easily obtained and may provide an insight into immune development, particularly when combined with a transcriptomics approach12. Previous studies from our group have successfully investigated the immune response of two dairy breeds to gradual weaning using whole blood to analyse alterations in the relative abundance of key immune genes13. Here, utilizing the whole blood transcriptome of dairy calves in addition to two beef breeds, we aim to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of immunocompetence, from birth through the first 7 days of life. Understanding such mechanisms would be a step towards integrating optimum husbandry practices, and to identifying possible biomarkers associated with development of immunocompetence for breeding of superior calves.\n\nSerum IgG concentrations at 0 h, 48 h, 72 h and 168 h post birth in dairy and beef calves are shown in Table 1. There was a significant effect of breed (P < 0.05) sampling time (P < 0.0001) and breed \u00d7 sampling time interaction (P < 0.0001) for serum IgG concentrations. As expected, at 0 h, prior to the first feed of colostrum, baseline serum IgG concentrations were lower (P < 0.0001) compared with all other sampling times. In LF calves, serum IgG concentrations were greater (P < 0.001) compared to dairy calves at 48, 72 and 168 h post-birth and were not different from CL, except at 168 h when concentrations were lower in CL compared with LF. Colostrum IgG concentrations (mean (SD)) were not different across the three cow breed types (H; 63.1 (14.4), CL; 63.0 (25.2) LF (71.0 (14.5) mg/mL).\n\nOverall relative gene expression levels in comparisons that yield significant levels of DEG are represented in Supplementary Figs 1\u20134 using principal component analysis and by mapping DEG using volcano plots. This plot represents overall relative gene expression abundances within each sample group and highlights similarities and differences in overall expression levels of transcripts in individual sample sets. Each comparison made in dairy and beef calves of levels of DEG present in each group are also presented as Venn diagrams in Supplementary Figs 5\u20139. Total numbers of DEG for each comparison are shown in Table 2. Lists of all DEG found in each comparisons are shown in Supplementary Tables 1\u20137. RNAseq data from the current study are available on NCBI\u2019s Gene Expression Omnibus through GEO Series accession number GSE114432.\n\nComparisons of dairy calves at 0 h, 48 h, 72 h and 168 h, were examined for the presence of enriched molecular and cellular functional networks, physiological system developmental networks, and for the presence of biologically interesting canonical pathways, which are shown in Table 2.\n\nThe top enriched pathway in the comparison of 0 h calves to those sampled at 48 h was the role of pattern recognition receptor in recognition of bacteria and viruses, in which enriched genes were present at higher levels of abundance in the 0 h samples. The complement system pathway was also enriched in the comparison, with the majority of the genes present at higher levels in the 48 h calves than in the 0 h. Enriched networks included \u2018Post translational modification\u2019 (Network 1) and \u2018Immunological disease\u2019 (Network 2, Fig. 1).\n\nComparison of the transcriptomic profile of calves aged 168 h to those sampled at 72 h highlighted 1l-8 signalling as the most enriched canonical pathway, with the majority of genes present at lower levels in the 168 h calves than in the 72 h. Networks of interest included \u2018Cell signalling, Molecular transport, Vitamin and mineral transport\u2019 (Network 3), and \u2018Cellular development, Cellular growth and Proliferation\u2019 (Network 4). On investigation of any upstream effects of DEG enriched in the comparison of 168 h and 72 h dairy calves, we identified inhibition of a growth factor at 168 h, TGF\u03b21. Additionally, inhibition of a transmembrane receptor, EPOR, was identified as \u22125.487 times lower in the 168 h calves, with 22 out of the proposed 366 genes involved in its upstream regulation present in the DEG list.\n\n(i) Comparisons over time within crossbreeds: Comparisons were carried out within each beef breed across the four time points, 0 h, 48 h, 72 h and 168 h, to investigate the transition of the developing immune response over time. The top over-represented networks are highlighted in Table 2. Firstly, biologically interesting pathways were investigated within the CL crossbred calves. Comparison of 48 h to 0 h CL calves resulted in 2095 DEG, 1766 of which were successfully mapped in IPA. Biologically interesting enriched molecular, cellular and physiological networks included cellular movement, immune cell trafficking, and lymphoid tissue structure and development. Top enriched canonical pathways included cholesterol biosynthesis, which was upregulated in the 48 h old calves, the complements system, also upregulated at 48 h, and two interleukin signalling pathways, 1l-9 and Il-12 in which the majority of genes were present at higher levels after 48 h. Investigating upstream analysis effector genes identified a number of significantly altered upstream regulators including a number of growth factors (Areg, Hgf, VEGFA), cytokines (c5f2, PRL, IFNa2), and also the Fc gamma receptor upstream pathway activated in the CL calves at 48 h. Supplementary Fig. 10 shows activation of transmigration of cells with many immunologically important receptors highlighted as upregulated in the 48 h calves. The calves were then compared at the later timepoint of 168 h to 72 h, to investigate the transition of the immune response evident through the blood transcriptome from day. Only 383 DEG were identified between the two time points in the CL calves. Top molecular cellular and physiological networks again included cellular movement, immune cell trafficking and also cellular function and maintenance. There were no canonical pathways identified as significantly enriched in the comparison. Overall a major stabilization of the immune response was evident through the inhibition of a number of immune related regulators (Supplementary Fig. 11).\n\nThe LF calves were also compared across the four time points (0 h, 48 h, 72 h and 168 h) to investigate the development of immunocompetence during the first week of life. Similarly high levels of DEG were evident at the early timepoint comparison of 48 h versus 0 h, with 2021 DEG identified in total, with 1640 of these being successfully mapped in IPA. Top enriched molecular and cellular networks included cellular movement, cellular function and maintenance; immune cell trafficking, and lymphoid tissue structure and development. A number of upstream regulators including a large number of cytokines (TNF\u03b1, Il1\u03b2, IFN), transmembrane receptors (TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, TLR9) exhibited activation in the 48 h calves compared to 0 h.\n\nLF calves were then compared at 168 h versus 72 h to identify observable alterations to key genes and pathways involved in the development of immunocompetence. Overall there were 1897 DEG identified, with 1562 being successfully mapped using IPA for functional analysis. The vast majority of total DEG, 1362 out of 1897, were present at lower levels in the 168 h calves, highlighting the stabilization on the initial surge in immune gene expression. A number of biologically interesting networks were enriched in pathway analysis of the 168 h and 72 h calves, including network 14 mapping enrichment of immune cell trafficking and the inflammatory response, of which the majority of genes are present at lower levels of expression by 168 h (Supplementary Fig. 12). Network 23 however, humoral immune response, showed upregulation of a number of genes in the 168 h calves (See Fig. 2). A significant number of upstream gene regulators including cytokines (Il1\u03b1, IFN\u03b3, Il1P, OSM), and immune regulatory complexes (MAP2K1, NF\u03baB) were inhibited by 168 h.\n\n(ii) Comparison of CL calves to LF calves across time: In order to investigate any differences in the development of a competent immune response during the first week of life in the two beef crossbreeds, the breeds were compared at each time point. Only the 48 h timepoint comparison generated a significant number of DEG, 716 in total, 594 of which were mapped for functional analysis using IPA. A number of interesting networks were highlighted as being enriched in the comparison of 48 h, including network 5, antimicrobial response, in which the majority of the genes were present at lower levels in the CL calves (Fig. 3). Figure 4 highlights variations in the overall immune response of cells showing inhibition in the CL calves at 48 h compared to the LF breed. Biologically important upstream regulators were also identified as being significantly differentially expressed in the comparison of beef CL to LF, including NF\u03baB and Il12 complexes, both inhibited in CL calves compared to LF at 48 h. A number of immunologically important upstream regulators were also inhibited in the beef CL calves, including CD40LG, the cytokine that binds to CD40 (Supplementary Fig. 13).\n\nHere we observed for the first time, the development of an immune response in calves of different breeds over the first seven days of life, using whole blood and RNA sequencing technologies. The molecular variations in key genes such as cytokines and B cell receptors across all breeds gives a tremendous insight into possible reasons as to why certain cattle breeds are more susceptible than others to illness during the neonatal period. It is clear from these data, that dairy calves undergo a systemic stress response following separation from the dam at birth and following artificial feeding of colostrum. Key genes increased in LF calves at 168 h including the immunoglobulin receptors FCER1A and FCRLA, and IL-12r, an immune regulator consistently down regulated in beef CL and in dairy calves, offer possible targets for biomarker discovery and a greater understanding into the development of immunocompetence.\n\nAll beef and dairy cows were immunised against the inactivated antigen strain of BoHV-1 (gE-) with a primary vaccine and a secondary booster vaccine at day (d)-84 and d-56 relative to the expected calving date (d 0), with 2 ml (S/C) of a commercial vaccine, Bovilis IBR marker inactivated (MSD Animal Health, Buckinghamshire, UK). All cows received a combined rotavirus, coronavirus and E. coli F5 (K99) vaccine (inactivated) (Rotavec Corona) by intra-muscular injection between 4 and 12 weeks prior to calving date.\n\nOne 50 mL sample of colostrum was taken at calving, prior to the initial feed. Samples were collected from the left quarter of the dams\u2019 udders. All quarters of the udder were cleaned before sample collection with dry paper towel, to avoid any debris entering the sample. Colostrum samples were analysed for total IgG. The 50 mL colostrum samples were centrifuged at 2000 \u00d7 g at 7 \u00b0C for 10 minutes. Following centrifugation, the fat-layer was removed with a sterile spatula. The supernatant (fat-free) was frozen at \u221220 \u00b0C for IgG analysis32\u201334.\n\nBlood samples were collected from the calf via the jugular vein using an 8.5 ml BD vacutainer (SST tube) (BD, Oxford, UK), at 0, 48, 72, and 168 hour (h) post birth. All blood samples were stored at room temperature for a minimum of 1 h to allow clotting to occur. Samples were then centrifuged at 1764 g for 15 min, the serum was collected and subsequently stored at \u221220 \u00b0C for IgG analysis.\n\nBloods for RNA extraction were collected via jugular venipuncture from all calves at 0 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 168 h post birth. The blood (3 mL) was collected using tempus blood RNA tubes (Life technologies, Paisley, Scotland). Immediately after blood collection, the tubes were shaken vigorously for 10 s, followed by storage at \u221280 \u00b0C until RNA isolation.\n\nColostrum (fat free) and serum (calf) samples were thawed at 4 \u00b0C overnight. IgG concentration was then determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for bovine IgG from Bio-X Diagnostics (Jemelle, Belgium)32,33. All components of the kit were brought to room temperature (21 \u00b0C) before use. The wash buffer was diluted 20 fold with distilled water. A calibration curve was constructed and all samples were diluted at 1:225 in phosphate buffer saline (PBS), as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. All samples (100 \u00b5l) were added to the test plate and tested in duplicate, along with standards using a 96-well dilution plate. Equal volumes of horse radish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate was added to each well of the dilution plate and then 100 \u00b5L of this was transferred to the test plate. Each test plate was incubated at room temperature (21 \u00b0C) for 1 hour. The plate was washed three times using wash solution. Chromogen solution (tetramethylbenzidine) was added to each well (100 \u00b5l/well) and the plate was protected from light and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. Stop solution was added to each well (50 \u00b5l/well) and the absorbance (optical densities) of the samples was read at a wavelength of 450 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer (Tecan Magellan, M\u00e4nnedorf, Switzerland). Negative controls were included on the test plate. An inter-assay CV of <0.15 was observed. These concentrations of IgG in the samples were averaged and then subtracted from the known concentrations of IgG in the reference standard absorbance values provided in the test kit. A standard curve was produced using the average values from duplicate standard wells. This curve illustrated the relationship between absorbance and IgG concentration. The coefficient of determination value for each assay had to exceed 0.9 on the standard curve for inclusion within these results32\u201334.\n\nRNA was isolated from whole blood collected from dairy and beef calves using the tempus spin RNA isolation reagent kit following manufacturer\u2019s guidelines (Applied Biosystems, USA). The quantity of the RNA isolated was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer ND-1000 (Nanodrop Technologies, DE, USA). RNA quality was assessed on the Agilent Bioanalyser 2100 using the RNA 6000 Nano Lab Chip kit (Agilent Technologies Ireland Ltd., Dublin, Ireland). RNA samples with 28S/18S ratios ranging from 1.8 to 2.0 and RNA integrity number (RIN) values of between 8 and 10 were deemed to be of high quality. RNA was stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until subsequent cDNA library preparation.\n\ncDNA libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq RNA sample prep kit following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). For each sample, 0.7 \u03bcg of RNA was used for cDNA library preparation. Briefly, mRNA was purified from total RNA and then fragmented. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Applied Biosystems Ltd., Life Technologies) subsequently synthesising the second strand using components of the Illumina TruSeq RNA sample prep kit. Adaptors were ligated to the cDNA which was then enriched by PCR. Final individual cDNA libraries were validated on the Agilent Bioanalyser 2100 using the DNA 1000 Nano Lab Chip kit (Agilent Technologies Ireland Ltd., Dublin, Ireland), ensuring that library fragment size was ~100 base pairs (bp) and library concentration was >30 ng/\u03bcl. Subsequently, individual RNAseq libraries were pooled based on their respective sample-specific-6 bp adaptors and sequenced at 100 bp/sequence single-end read using an Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer (Macrogen Europe, The Netherlands). Approximately 38.4 million sequences per sample (Mean \u00b1 SD = 38,432,764 \u00b1 7,169,473) were generated, with each calf representing an individual sample.\n\nReads were quality-filtered and adapter-trimmed using cutadapt, trimming the first 13 bp standard Illumina adapter, retaining reads with minimum base quality 30, minimum read length 20. Quality assessment of the filtered data was performed by FastQC. Both cutadapt and FastQC were called using the wrapper script TrimGalore! Using this information, samples with fewer than 107 reads were rejected from further analysis. Reads were mapped against the UMD3.1 Bos taurus genome from Ensembl 87. Read alignment was performed using STAR. Gene level read-counts were quantified using STAR\u2019s \u2018\u2013quantMode GeneCounts\u2019 parameter. Analysis of the count data was performed using R\u2019s Bioconductor package DESeq2. Raw count data was supplied to DESeq2, with no prior normalisation/transformation steps applied, as per DESeq2 guidelines. A DESeq2 internal analysis pipeline (DESeq) was then applied to the raw data, which estimates size factors, dispersion, performs negative binomial GLM fitting and calculates Wald statistics. Separately, read counts were transformed using DESeq2\u2019s varianceStabilizingTransformation function for visualisation purposes. Hierarchical Clustering (HC) and Principal Components Analysis (PCA) were used in initial, unsupervised analysis of the transformed data to provide information regarding trends and potential outliers. HC analysis was applied using average linkage and Pearson correlation as a distance metric. DESeq2 was used to perform differential expression analysis on the output of the DESeq pipeline. The Benjamini and Hochberg adjusted p-value threshold to denote statistical significance of changes in a given gene\u2019s expression levels was set to 0.05, with a fold change \u00b11.5 considered as a significantly altered level of transcript abundance. Genes above these requirement thresholds were referred to as differentially expressed genes (DEG) throughout.\n\nTo examine the molecular functions and genetic networks, the RNAseq data were further analysed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (v. 8.8, Ingenuity Systems, Mountain View, CA; http://www.ingenuity.com), a web-based software application that enables identification of over-represented biological mechanisms, pathways and functions most relevant to experimental datasets or genes of interest35,36. Network eligible genes derived from these datasets were overlaid onto a global molecular network developed from information contained in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. Networks of these genes were then generated algorithmically based on their connectivity (Ingenuity Systems, 2005). The network score is based on the hypergeometric distribution and is calculated with the right-tailed Fisher\u2019s Exact Test. Canonical pathway analysis identified the pathways from the IPA library of canonical pathways that were most significant to the dataset in terms of the ratio of the number of genes that mapped to the pathway from the dataset and a right-tailed Fisher\u2019s exact t-test to determine the probability that the genes mapped to the pathway by chance alone.\n\nColostrum and serum IgG data were checked for normality and homogeneity of variance by histograms, QQ-plots, and formal statistical tests as part of the UNIVARIATE procedure of SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute, 2006). Data that were not normally distributed were transformed by raising the variable to the power of lambda. The transformed data were used to calculate P-values. The corresponding least squares means (Lsmeans) and SEM of the non-transformed data are presented in the results for clarity. The serum IgG data were analysed using repeated measures mixed model ANOVA (PROC MIXED, SAS v 9.4) with animal ID, breed (cow breed), sampling time and their interactions included as a fixed effect. REML linear mixed models, was performed to detect significant differences between experimental breeds. The statistical model consisted of the individual animal as the experimental unit in all analyses. Breed was the fixed effect within the model. Animal was included in each model as a random effect. For repeated measures, sampling time was included as the repeated measure. Non-statistically significant interactions were removed from all the models. The type of variance-covariance structure used was chosen depending on the magnitude of the Akaike information criterion (AIC) for models run under compound symmetry, unstructured, autoregressive, heterogeneous 1st order autoregressive, or Toeplitz variance-covariance structures. The model with the least AIC value was selected. The differences between mean values were determined by F-tests using Type III sums of squares. The PDIFF was applied as appropriate to evaluate pairwise comparisons between means. A probability of P < 0.05 was selected as the level of significance and statistically tendencies were reported when P < 0.10. Differences between the means were examined using the PDIFF (difftype) option within the MIXED procedure of SAS. Means were considered statistically significant at a probability level of P < 0.05."}
