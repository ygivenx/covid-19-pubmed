{"title": "Solution-phase synthesis of 2-cyano and 2-amido aziridinyl peptides", "body": "The presence of small heterocycles, such as epoxides, aziridines, and thiiranes in peptide sequences is an important feature for the synthesis of electrophilic modified peptides, for their biological and pharmacological significance. 1 Among these small heterocycles, the aziridine functionality represents a valuable synthetic building block 2 due to its ability to undergo ring opening reactions with a wide range of nucleophiles. 3 We report here a solution-phase synthesis of 1-protected 2-cyano aziridinyl peptides 2, versatile building blocks to obtain aziridinyl peptides 4, through the free aziridines 3, and of 2-amido aziridinyl peptides 5 and 6, starting from (E)-acrylonitriles 1 bearing different L-a-amino ester residues (Scheme 1).\n\nThe chemical behavior of aziridines has prompted the preparation of short peptides incorporating this subunit. 4 However, to date the reported procedures require many reaction steps and suffer from low yields 5 as well as from the incompatibility of the required protecting groups on the aziridine amine function, mainly with established solid-phase peptide synthesis protocols. 6 Versatile and rapid routes to synthesize modified peptides containing an aziridine ring would be welcomed.\n\nMoreover, the aziridine ring substituents play an important role, modifying the reactivity and influencing the toxicity and above all the lipophilicity of these compounds. Studies on 2-cyano aziridines assigned an additional role to the cyano group for their pharmacological activity. In fact, the CN residue has been reported to react fast with cysteine at room temperature, behaving directly as the inhibitor of the active site of the cysteine proteases. 7 We found that N-protected O-sulfonyl hydroxylamine derivatives 8 in the presence of inorganic bases can behave as good aziridinating agents of EWG (electron-withdrawing group) functionalized alkenes. 9 Therefore the latter were converted in high yields into their corresponding N-acyloxy aziridines bearing the most common EWG and different alkyl or aryl groups. These compounds can be regarded as interesting precursors of various natural or unnatural aminated compounds. Moreover, it is known that aziridines are activated toward nucleophilic ring opening not only through the protonation of the aziridine nitrogen but also by N-acylation. 10\n\nHere we report a combinatorial ensemble of twenty-six N-functionalized aziridinyl peptides, 7 of which carry on the aziridine nitrogen another L-a-amino acidic residue and 2 malonic residues. Among them, 4 new amido aziridinyl peptides are synthesized by a highly selective hydrolysis of the cyano group.\n\nVery recently we prepared an array of peptides 1 starting from active methylene compounds, obtained from cyanoacetic acid and a-amino esters, and different aldehydes by Knoevenagel condensation reaction on Al 2 O 3 (Scheme 2). 11 Aziridine ring synthesis was tested using different nosyloxycarbamates (NsONHeY, Ns\u00bc4-NO 2 C 6 H 4 SO 2 ) in CH 2 Cl 2 and in the presence of CaO as the base. The reactions were successfully carried out using aminating reagents with different Y groups (CO 2 Et, 12 Boc, 8 Fmoc 13 ) giving directly the N-acyloxy aziridines 2. Full retention of the starting alkene configuration was always observed. The best results both for yields and diastereoselectivity were obtained by using tert-butyl nosyloxycarbamate (NsONHeBoc).\n\nThe aziridine library was constructed performing the amination reactions in a Carousel reaction station under heterogeneous phase conditions (CaO/CH 2 Cl 2 ) at 0 C (Scheme 3). For all reported reactions, substrate/NsONHeBoc/CaO molar ratio was 1:2:2. N-Boc protected aziridinyl peptides 2 were obtained, after simple filtration of the crude reaction mixtures, in high yields and in the diastereomeric ratios as reported in Table 1 .\n\nA moderate diastereoselectivity was observed, except when phenylalanine methyl ester is used in combination with a hindered group on the carbonecarbon double bond (entry 9). Nevertheless, we underline that, at this stage of the research, a complete stereoselectivity can paradoxically result in a limit of applications. In fact, it is important to access each of the new diastereomeric products, because of the possible drastic difference of reactivity in biological matrices between stereoisomers. In all cases a separation of the diastereomeric mixture is desirable and actually performed by HPLC.\n\nSince the discovery of epoxysuccinyl peptide E-64 in 1978 as a potent cysteine protease inhibitor, 14 a variety of inhibitors containing small rings, as electrophilic building blocks responsible for enzyme inhibition, have been developed. 15 The aziridinyl peptides 2 can be regarded as potential bioactive compounds, because the aziridine ring can be opened by nucleophiles not only through the cleavage of the CeN bond, 5a but also through the cleavage of the CeC bond. 16 The advantage of an aziridine moiety compared to an epoxide ring is the option to lengthen the peptide chain via the aziridine N-atom. Addressing our interest in the synthesis of more complex peptidomimetic structures, the selective removal of the Boc protecting group results in a crucial step for obtaining a new functionalization site. Classic acidic conditions are not suitable for Boc removal, due to the presence of labile functional groups. The use of BF 3 $Et 2 O 17 gave free aziridines, but in low yields. Finally, the deprotection reaction was successfully carried out using TBAF/THF 18 and the deprotected 2-cyano aziridinyl peptides 3 were obtained in the yields as reported in Table 2 , after purification by flash chromatography.\n\nIn order to introduce another a-amino acidic unit (entries 1e6) the DCC coupling procedure was chosen. Free cyano aziridines were made to react with commercially available N-Boc protected L-a-amino acids, namely BoceL-Ala and BoceL-Val, at room temperature. After work-up, 1-amino acyl 2-cyano aziridinyl peptides 4 carry the N-Boc that can be removed allowing a new possible site for peptide growth. As a different functionalization, a malonic unit was introduced on the aziridine\n\nScheme 2. Synthesis of (E)-acrylonitriles 1. nitrogen by the reaction of 3i with ethyl malonyl chloride leading to the N-malonyl 2-cyano aziridinyl peptide 4 0 i, a methylene active compound suitable for further synthetic elaborations (Scheme 4).\n\nThe results of synthetic elaborations of N-Boc protected aziridinyl peptides 2 were reported in Table 2 .\n\nRecently, structures similar to aziridines 4, also as a mixture of diastereomers, were tested like potential inhibitors of the M pro , the main coronavirus protease. 19 \n\nThe cyano group can be regarded as the precursor of other important functionalities, through selective chemical transformations. It is known that the presence of a C-terminal a-amido group on the peptide chain is essential for the biological activity of many peptide hormones. 20 The hydrolysis of the cyano group can be achieved by means of several procedures, most of which are unsuitable for the preservation of aziridine rings and peptide bonds. In general the selective hydrolysis of nitriles to amides is not an easy goal, often suffering from low yields. In addition, tertiary nitriles are especially resistant toward hydrolysis and few successful examples are reported in the literature. 21 This hydrolysis was attempted on representative members of 2-cyano aziridines, the N-Boc 2-cyano aziridines 2c and 2i, 11 the aziridinyl peptide 4c, and the N-malonyl 2-cyano aziridinyl peptide 4 0 i (Scheme 5).\n\nC-Terminal modified amido peptides 5 and 6 were cleanly obtained in high yields and purity (HPLC/UV) for all selected aziridines without further purification. Remarkably, the tertiary CN groups carried on multifunctional heterocycles 2c, 2i, 4c, and 4 0 i were successfully converted into the desired amido function at room temperature, using an H 2 O 2 /Na 2 CO 3 aqueous solution. 22 The results are reported in Table 3 .\n\nThe selective hydrolysis led to construction of a malonic unit that is one of the most important structural modifications of the backbone of a natural peptide, allowing the reversal of the direction of the peptide bond and then the preparation of retro-peptides. 23\n\nA method for the preparation of cyano and amido peptides has been introduced. The strategy employs a-amino acidic functionalized (E)-acrylonitriles as building blocks to obtain libraries of different polyfunctionalized aziridines under parallel solution-phase conditions. The employment of L-a-amino acids for the construction of the starting acrylonitrile library can simplify the generation of biologically active compounds. \n\nCaO (2 mmol) and NsONHeBoc (2 mmol) were added to a stirred solution of (E)-acrylonitriles 1aei (1 mmol) in CH 2 Cl 2 at 0 C. After the reaction was complete (TLC, 4 h), the crude aziridines were filtered through plugs filled with silica gel using a 9:1 hexane/ethyl acetate mixture, and the products 2aei were obtained as oils after solvent removal. The diastereomeric mixtures of 1-Boc 2-cyano aziridinyl peptides 2deh were separated by HPLC using an 8:2 hexane/ethyl acetate mixture (flow 1.3 mL/min) as the eluent. \n\nTo a THF solution of 2a, 2c, 2d, 2f, 2g, and 2i (0.2 mmol of pure major diastereomer) a solution of tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF, 1 M in THF) in equimolar amount was added, and the mixture was stirred under reflux for 20 min. The crude mixture was then dissolved in ethyl acetate and washed with a saturated aqueous solution of NaHCO 3 in a separator funnel. The organic layer was dried over Na 2 SO 4 and filtered. The deprotected 2-cyano aziridinyl peptides 3 were obtained as pure compounds after chromatographic purification on silica gel (eluent: 8:2 hexane/ethyl acetate mixture).\n\nTo a CH 2 Cl 2 solution of the 2-cyano peptides 3a, 3c, 3d, 3f, 3g, and 3i (0.5 mmol of pure major diastereomers) commercial BoceL-Ala or BoceL-Val and DCC in equimolar amounts and DMAP in catalytic amounts were added at room temperature. The reactions were followed by TLC until completion (24 h). After filtration, aziridinyl peptides 4 were obtained as pure compounds after flash chromatography on silica gel (eluent: 7:3 hexane/ethyl acetate mixture). room temperature. After reaction completion (TLC), the solvent was removed under vacuum, and the resulting aqueous mixture was extracted with CH 2 Cl 2 . The products were obtained with high purity after solvent removal."}
