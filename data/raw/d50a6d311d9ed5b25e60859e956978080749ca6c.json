{"title": "Genetic diversity and evolution of SARS-CoV-2", "body": "A new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is spreading cross the world (Phan, 2020) . Since the virus emerged at the seafood wholesale market at the end of last year (Zhu et al., 2019) , the number of infected cases has been rising dramatically (Velavan and Meyer, 2020) . Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed (Nishiura et al., 2020) . The virus has been detected in bronchoalveolar-lavage (Zhu et al., 2019) , sputum (Lin et al., 2020) , saliva (K.K. , throat (Bastola et al., 2020) and nasopharyngeal swabs .\n\nNucleotide substitution has been proposed to be one of the most important mechanisms of viral evolution in nature (Lauring and Andino, 2010) . The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 raises intriguing questions such as whether its evolution is driven by mutations. To assess the genetic variation, eighty-six complete or near-complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were collected from GISAID [https://www.gisaid. org/]. These SARS-CoV-2 strains were detected in infected patients from China (50), USA (11), Australia (5), Japan (5), France (4), Singapore (3), England (2), Taiwan (2), South Korea (1), Belgium (1), Germany (1), and Vietnam (1). The pair-wise nucleotide sequence alignment was performed by ClustalX2 (Saitou and Nei, 1987) , and the sequence of the strain China/WHU01/2020/EPI_ISL_406716 was used as a reference genome.\n\nLike other betacoronaviruses, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 has a long ORF1ab polyprotein at the 5\u2032 end, followed by four major structural proteins, including the spike surface glycoprotein, small envelope protein, matrix protein, and nucleocapsid protein (Phan, 2020) . Our genetic analysis discovered three deletions in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from Japan (Aichi), USA (Wisconsin), and Australia (Victoria) as shown in Fig. 1 . Two deletions (three nucleotides and twenty-four nucleotides) were in the ORF1ab polyprotein, and one deletion (ten nucleotides) was in the 3\u2032 end of the genome.\n\nIt is interesting that our nucleotide sequence alignment also revealed ninety-three mutations over the entire genomes of SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1) . Forty-two missense mutations were identified in all the major non-structural and structural proteins, except the envelope protein.\n\nTwenty-nine missense mutations were in the ORF1ab polyprotein, eight in the spike surface glycoprotein, one in the matrix protein, and four in the nucleocapsid protein. Of note, three mutations (D 354 , Y 364 , and F 367 ) located in the spike surface glycoprotein receptor-binding domain. The spike surface glycoprotein plays an essential role in binding to receptors on the host cell and determines host tropism (Fung and Liu, 2019) . It is also the major target of neutralizing antibodies (Yu et al., 2020) . Mutations in the spike surface glycoprotein might induce its conformational changes, which probably led to the changing antigenicity. To date, a study on localization of amino acids involved in conformational changes of the SARS-CoV-2 spike surface glycoprotein structure is not available. The identification of these amino acids is of significance and should be investigated by further studies. \n\nMutations found in the entire genome of SARS-CoV-2 strains.
