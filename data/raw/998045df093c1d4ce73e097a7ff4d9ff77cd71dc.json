{"title": "", "body": "As the role of contaminated surfaces in the transmission of nosocomial pathogens is increasingly recognised, there has been renewed emphasis on the importance of effective cleaning and disinfection (Dancer, 2009 ; . This chapter considers the rationale for 'no-touch' automated room disinfection (NTD) systems, which offer the potential to improve the effi cacy and reliability of hospital disinfection. An assessment of the level of surface contamination that is a risk for transmission and understanding the limitations of conventional cleaning and disinfection methods is important to appreciate the potential of NTD systems. This chapter provides Decontamination in hospitals and healthcare a detailed overview of the four classes of NTD system that are most commonly used in healthcare settings: aerosolised hydrogen peroxide (aHP), (H 2 O 2 ) vapour, ultraviolet C radiation (UVC) and pulsed-xenon UV (PX-UV). The differences between these systems in terms of their technological aspects, microbiological effi cacy, evidence of clinical impact and practicalities are described, along with a brief overview of other NTD systems and a consideration of their comparative effectiveness and cost. Based on these differences, the scenarios in which various NTD systems may be indicated are discussed in detail. Finally, future trends are also considered.\n\nAt one time, contaminated surfaces were thought to contribute negligibly to endemic transmission of pathogens in hospitals (Maki et al ., 1982 ; McGowan, 1981 ) . However, recent data indicate that contaminated surfaces make an important contribution to the endemic transmission of certain nosocomial pathogens (Maki et al ., 1982 ; Weber et al ., 2010 ) . The most convincing evidence comes from studies showing that admission to a room previously occupied by a patient colonised or infected with certain pathogens increases the risk of subsequent occupants acquiring these pathogens by a factor of at least two (Datta et al ., 2011 ; Drees et al ., 2008 ; Huang et al ., 2006 ; Nseir et al ., 2011 ; Shaughnessy et al ., 2011 ) . This association has been demonstrated for Clostridium diffi cile , vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Drees et al ., 2008 ; Huang et al ., 2006 ; Nseir et al ., 2011 ; Shaughnessy et al ., 2011 ) . The epidemiological association is strengthened by the fi nding that improving terminal room disinfection reduces or eliminates this increased risk (Datta et al ., 2011 ; Passaretti et al ., 2013 ) . Thus, current terminal cleaning and disinfection following the discharge of patients with these pathogens is inadequate and needs to be improved. The increasing age and susceptibility of hospitalised patients, combined with the emergence of more virulent and epidemic strains of C. diffi cile such as 027/ NAP1 and potentially untreatable multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria such as pan-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, carbapenemase producing organisms and certain viruses (for example the SARS Coronavirus), are further reasons to improve environmental decontamination (Dubberke et al ., 2007 ; Peleg and Hooper, 2010 ) . The effectiveness of conventional cleaning and disinfection can be limited by several factors, including those associated with the products used and the procedure adopted. The key limitation is the reliance on a human operator to correctly select and formulate an appropriate agent and then to distribute it to all target surfaces for the necessary contact time. Improvement of these conventional methods requires modifi cation of human behaviour, which is diffi cult to achieve and sustain. The use of NTD systems provides an adjunctive approach, which removes or reduces reliance on the operator (Byrns and Fuller, 2011 ; Davies et al ., 2011 ; Falagas et al ., 2011 ; Rutala and Weber, 2011 ) .\n\nAutomated systems have been adopted widely in other areas of healthcare to reduce reliance on operators and mitigate the potential for human error. Examples include robotic surgery and many aspects of critical care such as ventilators (Bryant, 1967 ; Howe and Matsuoka, 1999 ) . Indeed, commenting on the future of infection control in the late 1990s, Dr Robert Weinstein wrote: 'Given the choice of improving technology or improving human behavior, technology is the better choice' (Weinstein, 1998 ) . In recognition of these potential benefi ts, publications about NTD systems have increased sharply in the last two years ( Fig. 17.1 ) .\n\nDespite this recent interest, the concept of NTD is not new. Even before germ theory was formulated, 'fumigation' was performed through burning sulphur and other chemical mixtures (Blancou, 1995 ) . A paper published in 1901 provided a step-by-step guide on how to disinfect a 'sick-room' through gaseous formaldehyde (Riddle, 1901 ) . In the 1960s, formaldehyde was replaced by aerosolised chemicals such as quaternary ammonium compounds and phenolics due to concerns over toxicity and provided promising data on effectiveness (Friedman et al ., 1968 ; Munster and Ostrander, 1974 ; Ostrander and Griffi th, 1964 ) . However, concerns over effi cacy and safety led to advice from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) since the 1970s that disinfectant fogging should not be performed routinely in patient-care areas (Munster and Ostrander, 1974 ; Rutala et al ., 2008 ) . The increasing recognition of the importance of environmental contamination in transmission has prompted the development of several new NTD systems based on either hydrogen peroxide or ultraviolet radiation. The improved effi cacy and safety of these systems compared with the disinfectant aerosolisers of the 1960s and 1970s has prompted a re-evaluation of the CDC recommendation .\n\nThis review considers the rationale for using NTD systems when conventional cleaning and disinfection requires improvement, compares the use of the key NTD systems in different scenarios and discusses the role of regulators and professional societies in providing evidence-based adoption.\n\nThe relationship between the level of residual surface contamination after disinfection and the risk of transmission has not been studied in detail. The risk of transmission from an environmental surface depends on various factors, including the characteristics of the organism involved, patient susceptibility and staff compliance with universal precautions and infection control policies (for example hand hygiene following contact with surfaces) (Hayden et al ., 2008 ; Kramer et al ., 2006 ; Stiefel et al ., 2011 ) . The fact that subsequent occupants of a room vacated by a previously colonised or infected patient are at increased risk of infection indicates that conventional terminal cleaning and disinfection do not reduce contamination suffi ciently to prevent transmission in these cases (Drees et al ., 2008 ; Huang et al ., 2006 ; Nseir et al ., 2011 ; Shaughnessy et al ., 2011 ) . There is some limited evidence that the risk of transmission is proportional to the level of surface contamination. Lawley et al . ( 2010 ) developed a murine model and showed a dose-response relationship between the level of contamination in the cages and the proportion of healthy mice that developed C. diffi cile infection (CDI). All mice became infected when exposed for one hour to 100 spores/cm 2 and 50% became infected when exposed to 5 spores/cm 2 . The concentration at which none of the mice became infected was less than one spore per cm 2 . In the healthcare environment, room exposure times are usually measured in days and so the estimates by Lawley et al . are likely to be conservative. Lawley et al . then examined which disinfectants were able to interrupt the transmission of C. diffi cile and established a relationship between the level of inactivation of C. diffi cile spores in vitro and the degree to which transmission was interrupted ( Fig. 17 .2 ). Although data from animal studies should be interpreted with caution, these studies suggest that a low level of contamination can transmit spores to a susceptible host, and that there is a proportional relationship between the level of surface contamination and the degree of transmission.\n\nThe amount of shedding and the infective dose can be used to guide appropriate hospital cleaning and disinfection. Certain pathogens such as 17.2 Correlation between in vitro log reduction and interruption of transmission of C. diffi cile spores in a murine model (data from Lawley et al . ( 2010 ) (Larson and Borriello, 1990 ; Yezli and Otter, 2011 ) . For example, the infectious dose for norovirus is 1-100 viral particles while stool concentrations can reach more than 10 12 particles per gram and up to 10 5 norovirus particles per 30 cm 2 have been identifi ed on hospital surfaces (Morter et al ., 2011 ) . Therefore, the presence of a pathogen on a surface at any concentration may be a risk for transmission. This is refl ected in proposed guidelines for microbiological hygiene standards (Dancer, 2004 ) and recent discussion surrounding the intended target for hospital disinfection (Roberts, 2012 ; Walder and Holmdahl, 2012 ) .\n\nHowever, in practice, a risk-based approach must be used when setting a target for an acceptable level of residual contamination, balancing patient safety with practicality and cost, as is the case when selecting liquid disinfectants. More stringent targets should be set when the risk and/or consequences of infection are high, for example, for virulent, resistant and/ or highly infectious pathogens, especially in high-risk settings with immunocompromised patients whereas a lower standard may be acceptable in lower-risk settings (Dancer, 2004 ; Roberts, 2012 ; Walder and Holmdahl, 2012 ) .\n\nConventional cleaning and disinfection is performed by a human operator with liquid detergents or disinfectants. Microbiological studies indicate that conventional cleaning and disinfection without programmes of targeted improvement rarely eliminate pathogens from surfaces (Byers et al ., 1998 ; French et al ., 2004 ; Manian et al ., 2011 ; Wilcox et al ., 2003 ) . For example, MRSA was identifi ed on 66% of surfaces in patient rooms following terminal cleaning in one study (French et al ., 2004 ) and C. diffi cile spores persisted despite bleach disinfection in another Kaatz et al ., 1988 ; Verity et al ., 2001 ) . Problems associated with both 'product' and 'procedure' contribute to the failures of conventional cleaning and disinfection. These include the ineffectiveness of some agents against some pathogens, for example, many common hospital disinfectants are not effective against C. diffi cile spores (Fraise, 2011 ; Humphreys, 2011 ) and norovirus (Dettenkofer and Block, 2005 ) ; toxicity to staff or the environment; damage to materials and equipment resulting in restrictions on usage (Dettenkofer and Block, 2005 ; Mirabelli et al ., 2007 ) ; certain agents are inhibited by organic matter on surfaces (Humphreys, 2011 ) ; and there is a potential for biocide/antibiotic cross-resistance for some agents (Meyer and Cookson, 2010 ) .\n\nThe key problem associated with the cleaning and disinfection procedure is the reliance on the operator to repeatedly ensure adequate selection, formulation, distribution and contact time of the agent (Carling et al ., 2008 ; Fraise, 2011 ) . For example, a large assessment of conventional cleaning in 36 acute hospitals using fl uorescent markers revealed that less than 50% of high-risk objects in hospital rooms were cleaned at patient discharge (Carling et al ., 2008 ) . Distribution of the active agent is diffi cult in the complex and intricate healthcare environment (Carling et al ., 2008 ) . Ensuring the correct contact time to attain the microbial reduction achieved in vitro is particularly problematic because the disinfectant will evaporate from the surface (Fraise, 2011 ) . Other problems include the delegation of responsibility for cleaning, which can fall between staff groups such as nurses and domestic housekeepers particularly in the case of complex portable medical equipment ; diffi culties in measuring the effectiveness of cleaning and disinfection and achieving compliance with protocols/policies from an (often) poorly paid, poorly motivated workforce who may have limited spoken or written local language skills (Dancer, 1999 ) ; inadequate training and education of personnel (Dancer, 1999 ) ; inadequate time given to do the job properly (Dancer, 1999 ) ; insuffi cient (or non-existent) cleaning prior to disinfection (Humphreys, 2011 ) ; incorrect formulation of the disinfectant (Meyer and Cookson, 2010 ; Weber et al ., 2007 ) ; and contamination of cleaning solutions/ materials (Weber et al ., 2007 ; Werry et al ., 1988 ) .\n\nModifying human behaviour is diffi cult but several different approaches can be taken, including routine microbiological analysis of surface hygiene, the use of fl uorescent markers or ATP assays to assess the thoroughness of cleaning, feedback of cleaning performance, and education to enhance knowledge about the importance of the process Carling et al ., 2008 ; Dancer, 2004 ; Datta et al ., 2011 ; Mulvey et al ., 2011 ; Rutala and Weber, 2011 ) . The development of improved protocols and structured career progression for cleaning staff should be considered in addition to monitoring and feedback. This can improve the frequency of surfaces that are cleaned (Carling et al ., 2006 (Carling et al ., , 2008 and reduce the level of environmental contamination (Eckstein et al ., 2007 ; Goodman et al ., 2008 ) . There is some evidence that improving the effi cacy of conventional cleaning/ disinfection can reduce the acquisition of pathogens Datta et al ., 2011 ; Hayden et al ., 2006 ) . For example, Hayden et al . ( 2006 ) performed a 9-month prospective before and after study of educational improvements of cleaning and hand hygiene: the proportion of surfaces contaminated with VRE was reduced from 24% to 12% and patient acquisition of VRE was reduced from 33 to 17 acquisitions per 1000 patient-days. Few studies have evaluated the sustainability of such systematic improvements. One study showed that cleaning performance measured by the removal of a fl uorescent marker increased from a baseline of 52% to 80-85% through training and monthly feedback (Fitzgerald et al ., 2012 ) . However, compliance soon returned towards baseline (57-66%) when the monthly feedback ceased. Similarly, recent evidence indicates that altering the location of fl uorescent dye spots reduced the proportion of objects that were cleaned from 90% to approximately 60% .\n\nIn situations where the elimination of pathogens is required, even systematic improvement of conventional cleaning and disinfection may not be suffi cient. Multiple rounds of disinfection with sodium hypochlorite (bleach), taking many hours Manian et al ., 2011 ) , risking damage (corrosion) to materials (Dettenkofer and Block, 2005 ; McGowan et al ., 1988 ) and presenting health risks for operators (Mirabelli et al ., 2007 ) , can have limited success in removing environmental reservoirs of pathogens (Byers et al ., 1998 ; Manian et al ., 2011 ; Morter et al ., 2011 ) . For example, an average of 2.8 rounds of quaternary ammonium compound disinfections were required to eradicate VRE from a room in one study (Byers et al ., 1998 ) and A. baumannii or MRSA were cultured from 27% of rooms sampled after four rounds of cleaning and bleach disinfection . NTD systems offer the potential to overcome some of these problems (Byrns and Fuller, 2011 ; Davies et al ., 2011 ; Falagas et al ., 2011 ) .\n\nThe most commonly used NTD systems in healthcare are aHP systems (such as ASP Glosair -previously Sterinis, Steris Biogienie and Oxypharm Nocospray), H 2 O 2 vapour systems (such as the Bioquell and Steris systems) and UVC systems (such as Lumalier Tru-D) (Boyce, 2009 ; Davies et al ., 2011 ; Falagas et al ., 2011 ; Orlando et al ., 2008 ; Rutala and Weber, 2011 ) . A fourth class of NTD system based on PX-UV radiation has been introduced recently and has been the subject of few limited studies so far .\n\nConsidering what would make an 'ideal' NTD system is useful in comparing the features of the various systems available (Table 17 .1 ). The 'ideal' system would have a short cycle time; a high effi cacy to eliminate pathogens from surfaces; homogeneous distribution of the active agent; the system should be easy to operate, fully automated, require minimal safety measures, allow instant access to the room and have no environmental impact; fi nally, the system should have published evidence of clinical impact and the necessary regulatory approvals. Clearly, no single system meets all of these requirements and the importance of each feature will depend on the application. 3 1 (HPV); 2 (VHP) Evidence of clinical impact = does meet the characteristic of the 'ideal' NTD system. = does not meet the characteristic of the 'ideal' NTD system. / = it is not clear whether or not the characteristic of the 'ideal' NTD system is met. a Immediate room entry may be advantageous in the event of an emergency. b Rapid review panel recommendations are as follows: 1. Basic research and development, validation and recent in use evaluations have shown benefi ts that should be available to NHS bodies to include as appropriate in their cleaning, hygiene or infection control protocols. 2. Basic research and development has been completed and the product may have potential value; in use evaluations/trials are now needed in an NHS clinical setting. 3. A potentially useful new concept but insuffi ciently validated; more research and development is required before it is ready for evaluation in practice.\n\naHP aHP systems deliver a pressure-generated aerosol. The systems used most commonly in healthcare use a solution containing 5-6% hydrogen peroxide and < 50 ppm silver ( Fig. 17 .3 ) Orlando et al ., 2008 ; Otter et al ., 2010b ; Shapey et al ., 2008 ) . These systems are sometimes known as 'dry-mist hydrogen peroxide', though this term is a poor refl ection of their properties Barbut et al ., 2009 ) . Aerosolised droplets are introduced into an enclosure via a unidirectional nozzle (Boyce, 2009 ; Rutala and Weber, 2011 ) . One manufacturer (ASP Glosair) states a particle size of 8-10 \u03bc m (Fu et al ., 2012 ; Holmdahl et al ., 2011 ) whereas another (Oxypharm Nocospray) states a smaller particle size of 0.5 \u03bc m . The dose typically recommended for hospital rooms is 6 mL per m 3 , although multiple cycles of this dose have been used in several studies (Andersen et al ., 2006 ; Holmdahl et al ., 2011 ) . Following exposure, the aerosol is usually left to decompose naturally, without any active aeration.\n\nH 2 O 2 vapour systems deliver a heat-generated vapour of 30-35% w/w aqueous hydrogen peroxide through a high-velocity air stream to achieve homogeneous distribution throughout an enclosed area (enclosure) (Fig. 17 .4 ) (Boyce, 2009 ; . Two systems using H 2 O 2 vapour are available commercially -Bioquell and Steris. Bioquell systems are usually termed hydrogen peroxide vapour (HPV) and Steris systems vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP). Bioquell HPV includes a generator to produce HPV, a module to measure the concentration of HPV, temperature and relative humidity in the enclosure and an aeration unit to catalyse the breakdown of HPV to oxygen and water vapour after HPV exposure. A control pedestal is situated outside the enclosure to provide remote control. Bioquell HPV is delivered until the air in the enclosure becomes saturated and H 2 O 2 begins to condense on surfaces Ray et al ., 2010 ) . Steris VHP systems have a generator inside the room with an integral aeration unit and dehumidifi er designed to achieve a set humidity level prior to the start of the cycle. \n\nUVC systems for room decontamination deliver specifi c doses (for example, 12 000 \u03bc Ws/cm 2 for vegetative bacteria and 22 000-36 000 \u03bc Ws/cm 2 for spores) of UVC (254 nm range) to surfaces ( Fig. 17 .5 ) Nerandzic et al ., 2010 ; Rutala et al ., 2010 ) . The device is placed in the centre of the room and commonly touched mobile items are arranged close to the device for optimal exposure. UVC travels in straight lines and is less effective out of direct line of sight from the device. Some manufacturers therefore recommend multiple cycles from different locations . Some UVC systems contain sensors to measure the amount of UVC light refl ected back to the device to confi rm the delivery of a specifi ed dose to all parts of the room.\n\nPX-UV systems emit broad spectrum UV in short pulses ( Fig. 17 .5 ) . They are placed at multiple room locations and have a relatively short cycle time. \n\nStudies evaluating the in vitro and in situ effi cacy of NTD systems are summarised in Tables 17.2 and 17 .3 , respectively. One aHP system (ASP Glosair) achieves a \u223c 4-log reduction on C. diffi cile spores in vitro ) and has limited capacity to inactivate commercially produced 6-log spore biological indicators (BIs) (Andersen et al ., 2006 ; Holmdahl et al ., 2011 ) . Catalase-positive bacteria are considerably less susceptible to the low concentration of H 2 O 2 used by aHP systems than catalase-negative bacteria or metabolically inert spores (Otter and French, 2009 ; Pottage et al ., 2012 ) . The effi cacy of aHP systems against catalase-positive bacteria remains to be fi rmly established, with confl icting published data on the level of inactivation of MRSA and A. baumannii (Fu et al ., 2012 ; Piskin et al ., 2011 ) and tuberculocidal activity (Andersen, 2010 ; Andersen et al ., 2010 ; Beswick et al ., 2011 ; Grare et al ., 2008 ) . aHP systems have been shown to reduce contamination of C. diffi cile and MRSA on hospital surfaces Barbut et al ., 2009 ; Chan et al ., 2011 ; Orlando et al ., 2008 ; Shapey et al ., 2008 ), but have not been shown to eliminate pathogens in clinical practice. For example, one or more positive C. diffi cile cultures were collected from 20% of 15 ) and 50% of 10 rooms studied after an aHP process. Both Bioquell HPV and Steris VHP systems are Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered sterilants, which means they have passed the AOAC sporicide test on porous and non-porous surfaces (Humphreys, 2011 ) . Both systems are associated with the elimination of pathogens from surfaces in situ (Bates and Pearse, 2005 ; Boyce et al ., 2008 ; Hardy et al ., 2007 ; Jeanes et al ., 2005 ; Manian et al ., 2011 ; Otter et al ., 2008 Otter et al ., , 2010c Ray et al ., 2010 ) and cycles are validated by a > 6-log reduction of Geobacillus stearothermophilus BI spores (Bates and Pearse, 2005 ; Boyce et al ., 2008 ; Hardy et al ., 2007 ; Jeanes et al ., 2005 ) . HPV and VHP are sporicidal, bactericidal, mycobactericidal and virucidal, achieving a > 6-log reduction against a wide range of nosocomial pathogens including C. diffi cile spores, MRSA, VRE, A. baumannii and norovirus surrogates (Barbut et al ., 2012 ; Bentley et al ., 2012 ; Berrie et al ., 2011 ; Goyal et al ., 2011 ; Hall et al ., 2007 ; Otter and French, 2009 ; Pottage et al ., 2010 ) , though effi cacy may be reduced by high microbial loading and the presence of organic soil (Fu et al ., 2012 ; Otter and French, 2009 ; Pottage et al ., 2010 ) .\n\nUVC produces a dose-dependent 2 to 4-log reduction of nosocomial pathogens experimentally dried onto surfaces but the microbiological reduction is signifi cantly lower out of direct line of sight of the device Nerandzic et al ., 2010 ; Rutala et al ., 2010 ) . For example, in one study, a 1-log reduction was achieved on C. diffi cile spores inoculated on plastic carriers placed 10 feet (3 m) away from the device out of direct \n\n2012\n\nPlastic or laminate carriers with 5-6 log of C. diffi cile spores exposed to HPV in unfurnished, unoccupied 33-45 m 3 rooms.\n\nC. diffi cile was completely eradicated from the exposed carriers regardless of the C. diffi cile strain or surface used. Otter et al .\n\n2012 A 100 m 3 test room MRSA carriers containing 6.1-7.3 log of MRSA suspended in distilled water, 0.3%, 3% or 10% BSA, TSB or 0.9% saline and dried on stainless steel discs were exposed to HPV.\n\nThe effectiveness of HPV was reduced in a step-wise manner as type and concentration of simulated soiling increased. No MRSA was recovered from any of the carriers after 60 min exposure to HPV. Carrier disks with \u223c 10 6 C. diffi cile spores and BIs with 10 4 and 10 6 G. stearothermophilus spores were placed in 5 sites (3 sites were not in direct line of sight from the HPV generator).\n\nHPV achieved > 6-log reduction on C. diffi cile in all 5 sites. HPV inactivated 99% (74/75) of 6-log BIs and 100% (75/75) of 4-log BIs.\n\nFu et al . Stainless steel indicators of \u223c 10 6 MRSA or \u223c 10 6 commercially available G. stearothermophilus BIs were exposed to Steris VHP in a test chamber. BIs were removed and enumerated at timed intervals.\n\nAfter 30 min exposure to VHP there was \u223c 3-log reduction in MRSA and \u223c 5-log reduction G. stearothermophilus spores, indicating that the catalase-positive MRSA are less susceptible to VHP than the metabolically inert spores. Pottage et al . ( 2010 ) 2010 A class III safety cabinet MS2 bacteriophage was dried on 10 mm diameter stainless steel discs at concentrations of 7-9-log pfu/carrier. MS2 phage was also dried in 10% or 50% horse blood. Inoculated carriers were exposed to either VHP (Steris) or HPV (Bioquell).\n\nHPV caused > 6-log reduction on the phage; VHP caused a 5-6 log reduction on the phage. Reductions for HPV were 5.8 and 2.7 when the virus was dried in 10% and 50% horse blood, respectively. Reductions for VHP were > 9 and 3.5 when the virus was dried in 10% and 50% horse blood, respectively. Otter and French ( 2009 ) 2009 A 100 m 3 test room Five strains of MRSA and three stains of VRE, Acinetobacter spp., K. pneumoniae and C. diffi cile spores were dried on stainless steel discs at concentrations of 5-7-log cfu/carrier either in water or BSA to simulate soiling.\n\nAll carriers were inactivated after exposure to HPV when dried from water or 0.3% BSA. \u223c 3-log M. tuberculosis dried on stainless steel carriers were exposed to HPV in a biological safety cabinet and at 10 locations in a BSL III laboratory room. 6-log G. stearothermophilus BIs were also exposed to HPV in the room experiment. \n\n2008 Hospital room 5 different locations (20-100 cm 2 ) in the room were inoculated with 100 cfu/cm 2 (3-4-log) of MRSA cultures diluted in urine. One or three aHP decontamination cycles were run.\n\nAll samples were negative after one or three aHP cycles. Andersen et al . ( 2006 ) 2006 Hospital rooms (4-58 m 3 ) and garages (120-200 m 3 )\n\n6-log B. atrophaeus spore BIs were used. BIs were placed at various locations in rooms, ambulances parked in garages, and on the outside and inside of medical equipment.\n\nOne or two aHP cycles had no effect on BIs. Three aHP cycles inactivated 87% (127/146) of BIs in two test rooms, 62% (137/220) of BIs on or in medical equipment and all BIs (60/60) in the ambulances.\n\nHavill et al . Carrier disks with \u223c 10 6 C. diffi cile spores and BIs with 10 4 and 10 6 G. stearothermophilus spores were placed in 5 sites (3 sites were not in direct line of sight from the UVC unit) and exposed to 22 000 \u03bc Ws/cm 2 .\n\nUVC achieved a mean of 2.2 log reduction on C. diffi cile (range 1.7-3 log reduction). UVC inactivated 29% (22/75) of 4-log BIs (range 7-53%) and 0% (0/75) of 6-log BIs. UVC was signifi cantly less effective out of direct line of sight. Carrier disks with \u223c 10 5 C. diffi cile spores were placed in 5 sites (3 sites were not in direct line of sight from the devices) using a 1-(22 000 \u03bc Ws/cm 2 ) or 2-stage procedure.\n\n1-stage procedure: 68 min median cycle time and mean of 2.2 log reduction (range 1.7-2.9 log reduction). 2-stage procedure: 84 min median cycle time and mean of 2.3 log reduction (range 1.4-3.2 log reduction). UVC was signifi cantly less effective out of direct line of sight. 2010 Laboratory bench top C. diffi cile spores, MRSA and VRE suspended in PBS or 10 mg/ml BSA were dried on bench tops (1 cm 2 ) at 3-5 log. Inactivation of pathogens was assessed at refl ected doses ranging from 5 000 to 22 000 \u03bc Ws/cm 2 .\n\nSporicidal cycle (22 000 \u03bc Ws/cm 2 ) achieved reductions of > 2-4 for MRSA, C. diffi cile and VRE. Increasing the dose from 5 000 to 20 000 \u03bc Ws/cm 2 increased effi cacy for C. diffi cile spores (from 1.1 to 2.7 log) but not for VRE or MRSA. Suspending medium or room location did not affect log reductions signifi cantly. Hospital rooms Plastic carriers with \u223c 10 5 C. diffi cile spores were placed around the room and exposed to 22 000 \u03bc Ws/cm 2 (sporicidal cycle).\n\nUVC achieved a 2.6-log reduction on carriers in direct line of sight and 1-log reduction on carriers out of direct line of site. Staphylococcus warneri was dried on 1 cm 2 areas on 26 frequently touched sites and on 20 portable equipment sites at 4-5 log and exposed to 12 000 \u03bc W/cm 2 (vegetative cycle).\n\nUVC achieved a \u223c 3.5-log reduction on the 26 environmental sites and a 2-log reduction on equipment.\n\nRutala et al . \n\n2007 A 500-bed hospital Standardised sites in a single-occupancy ward side-room with an en-suite bathroom were sampled for MRSA, GNR and VRE using cotton swabs before and after HPV decontamination.\n\nMRSA was isolated from 12 (40.0%) and one (3.3%) of the 30 sites sampled before and after HPV respectively. GNR were isolated from 3 (10.0%) and none (0%) of the 30 sites sampled before and after HPV, respectively. VRE was isolated from one (6.7%) and none (0%) of the 15 sites sampled before and after HPV, respectively. Boyce et al . \n\nEnvironmental sampling for C. diffi cile of clinical areas was performed using moistened cotton swabs before and after aHP.\n\nC. diffi cile was isolated from 48 (23.6%) of 203 swabs taken before aHP and from 7 (3.4%) of 203 of the swabs taken after aHP. Bartels et al . ( 2008 ) 2008 A Danish hospital 14 upholstered chairs involved in an MRSA outbreak were sampled before and after decontamination with aHP.\n\nBefore decontamination, 4 (28.6%) of 14 chairs were positive for MRSA. After aHP, 1 (7.1%) of 14 chairs yielded MRSA. Before decontamination, 81 (20.3%) of the 400 sites sampled were positive for MRSA. After UVC, 2 (0.5%) of the 400 sites sampled yielded MRSA. Rooms were not cleaned prior to UVC treatment.\n\nStibich et al .\n\nSurfaces were sampled in rooms that had housed VRE patients using moistened swabs before and after PX-UV exposure.\n\nBefore decontamination, 4 (4.4%) of the 91 sites sampled were positive for VRE. After UV treatment, none of the 75 sites sampled yielded VRE.\n\nline of sight, compared with 2.6-log in direct line of sight . Several studies of one UVC system (Lumalier Tru-D) indicated a signifi cant reduction of surface contamination measured by total aerobic count or sampling for specifi c pathogens; however, there was incomplete inactivation of C. diffi cile , VRE, Acinetobacter or MRSA on hospital surfaces Nerandzic et al ., 2010 ; Rutala et al ., 2010 ) . A PX-UV system (Xenex) achieved a signifi cant reduction in VRE contamination in a room in a 12 minute cycle . Further effi cacy data are awaited.\n\nHPV has been used to remove environmental reservoirs during outbreaks of C. diffi cile , MRSA and meticillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) Jeanes et al ., 2005 ; Otter et al ., 2008 ) multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (Bates and Pearse, 2005 ; Kaiser et al ., 2011 ; Otter et al ., 2010c ) and other pathogens . VHP has been used for tackling environmental reservoirs during outbreaks of A. baumannii in two reports (Chmielarczyk et al ., 2012 ; Ray et al ., 2010 ) . The clinical impact of VHP aside from outbreak settings is not reported. On the other hand, three studies have assessed the impact of HPV in the setting of endemic infections. A prospective cohort study by Passaretti et al . demonstrated that patients admitted to rooms vacated by patients with multidrug resistant organisms (MDROs) and disinfected using HPV were 64% less likely to acquire MDROs than patients admitted to such rooms disinfected using standard methods (Passaretti et al ., 2013 ) . Thus, HPV decontamination successfully mitigated the risk from the prior room occupant.\n\nTwo pre-post studies have evaluated the clinical impact of HPV Manian et al ., 2013 ) . Boyce et al . ( 2008 ) performed a before and after study showing that HPV decontamination of rooms vacated by patients with C. diffi cile infection (CDI) signifi cantly reduced the incidence of CDI both on targeted wards and hospital-wide when the analysis was restricted to the months when the epidemic strain was known to be present. Manian et al . ( 2011 ) performed a before and after study showing that HPV decontamination of rooms vacated by patients with CDI (or quadruple bleach disinfection where HPV was not available) signifi cantly reduced the hospital-wide incidence of CDI by 37%. Whilst it was not possible to differentiate the impact of introducing HPV and quadruple bleach disinfection, a previous study by the same group showed that quadruple bleach disinfection was necessary to eliminate A. baumannii and MRSA from surfaces, and that HPV was microbiologically superior to quadruple bleach disinfection. Thus, since HPV has time and effi ciency savings compared with quadruple bleach disinfection, it was cost effective to use HPV in this setting (Manian et al ., 2013 ) .\n\nCurrently, there is no published evidence that disinfection with aHP, UVC or PX-UV systems reduce epidemic or endemic infection rates.\n\naHP is straightforward to use and relatively inexpensive compared with H 2 O 2 vapour and UVC systems. The capacity of single units to decontaminate areas larger than single rooms is limited so multiple generators may be necessary . Doors and air vents should be sealed and hand-held health and safety monitors are required to ensure that no leakage occurs during cycles and to verify that the concentration of hydrogen peroxide inside the enclosure is below health and safety exposure limits (Fu et al ., 2012 ) . Reported cycle times are 3-4 hours for multiple cycles Holmdahl et al ., 2011 ) and 2 hours for single cycles . However, cycle times for single rooms may be considerably longer when hand-held sensors are used to ensure the hydrogen peroxide concentrations are below health and safety limits prior to room re-entry (Fu et al ., 2012 ) . Several studies suggest that homogeneous distribution of the active agent is not achieved (Fu et al ., 2012 ; Holmdahl et al ., 2011 ; Shapey et al ., 2008 ) , perhaps because aHP is introduced via a unidirectional nozzle and the particles are affected by gravity. Sub-lethal exposure to hydrogen peroxide or silver could result in the development of tolerance or resistance (Chopra, 2007 ; McDonnell and Russell, 1999 ; Meyer and Cookson, 2010 ) . The potential for transferable resistance to silver is greater than for hydrogen peroxide due to plasmid-mediated silver resistance genes (Chopra, 2007 ; McDonnell and Russell, 1999 ) . Data are required confi rming the compatibility of aHP systems with common hospital materials, including sensitive electronics. Finally, several studies have noted equipment reliability problems Fu et al ., 2012 ; Shapey et al ., 2008 ) , which was a feature of older foggers (Munster and Ostrander, 1974 ) .\n\nH 2 O 2 vapour systems have been used to decontaminate rooms French et al ., 2004 ) , multi-bedded bays (Bates and Pearse, 2005 , Boyce et al ., 2008 ; Dryden et al ., 2008 ) and entire units Jeanes et al ., 2005 ; Otter et al ., 2010c ) . However, H 2 O 2 vapour systems are less straightforward than UV and aHP systems because they require two units (a generator and aeration unit) for a single room. Door and air vents need to be sealed. As with aHP, hand-held health and safety monitors are required to ensure that no leakage occurs during cycles and that the concentration of H 2 O 2 inside the enclosure is below health and safety exposure limits (1 ppm) before re-entry. Thus, staff training requirements for using H 2 O 2 systems are higher than for UV systems. The potential for selection of less susceptible strains is lower than for aHP or UV systems because the high-concentration H 2 O 2 vapour systems ensures that few microorganisms undergo sub-lethal exposure. Reported cycle times are currently 1.5-2.5 hours for a single room for HPV (Department of Health, 2009 ; Otter and Yezli, 2010 ) and 8 hours for VHP . The compatibility of HPV with hospital materials, including sensitive electronics, is well established (EPA, 2010a ). A recent study reported incompatibility of HPV with one brand of paint that was rectifi ed by replacing the paint with a different brand (Passaretti et al ., 2013 ) .\n\nUVC is easy to use, does not require sealing of door or air vents and has a relatively short cycle time. Many high-touch sites may be out of line of sight; some manufacturers recommended multiple cycles in different parts of the room to overcome this problem but this places reliance on the operator to choose appropriate equipment locations, has implications for cycle times and requires more hands-on operator time. A recent study indicates that a UVC spore cycle in rooms ranging from 46-86 m 3 took a median of 84 min (range 72-146 min) for a two-stage procedure (where the UVC unit is positioned at two locations during the cycle) and a median of 68 min (range 34-100 min) for a one-stage procedure . Since some UVC systems rely on measurement of refl ected dose to determine the cycle, the presence of surfaces that do not refl ect UVC, or refl ect it ineffi ciently (such as glass), variations in temperature and humidity and the age of the bulbs will affect the refl ected dose and may increase the cycle times (Memarzadeh et al ., 2010 ; Reeda, 2010 ) . The intensity of the UV light dissipates with the square of the distance from the source, which limits the capacity of single UVC devices to disinfect areas larger than single patient rooms (Harrington and Valigosky, 2007 ) . The long-term impact of UVC on hospital materials has not been described (Tyan et al ., 2002 ) . UVC is relatively expensive compared with other NTD systems (ECRI, 2011) . Finally, UV radiation is a known mutagen (Anderson, 1995 ) ; since UVC systems do not inactivate all microbes in the room, a proportion of those that have received a sublethal dose may undergo mutation.\n\nPX-UV systems have similar practical considerations to UVC systems, including the need to use multiple room locations to address line of sight issues, the age of the bulbs affecting intensity of the pulse, limited capacity to decontaminate areas larger than singe rooms and the potential for mutagenesis. Also, the system operates using a series of bright 'camera fl ashes', which may be disruptive to patients and staff outside the room. However, given the short cycles associated with PX-UV, it should be prioritised for further evaluation.\n\nGaseous ozone for room disinfection has also been evaluated Sharma and Hudson, 2008 ) . Two studies of different ozone generators were performed in test chambers of 30-35 m 3 , which used a concentration of ozone gas peaking at 20-25 ppm. These studies indicated a 3-4 log reduction on vegetative bacteria, a < 3-log reduction on mycobacteria and a dose-dependent < 3-log reduction on bacterial endospores in one study ) but a > 4-log spore reduction in the other (Sharma and Hudson, 2008 ) . Both evaluations tested the systems at high humidity, one at 80-90% ) and one at > 95% (Sharma and Hudson, 2008 ) . Another system used a high concentration of gaseous ozone (80 ppm) and up to 3% aHP combined with high humidity (80%) to achieve a > 6-log reduction of various hospital pathogens in vitro . Substantially lower reductions were achieved at lower relative humidity . The requirement for high humidity is a major practical limitation for ozone-based systems (Li and Wang, 2003 ) . Furthermore, ozone is toxic to humans, with a safe exposure level in the UK and USA of < 0.1 ppm (compared with 1 ppm for H 2 O 2 ), so effective containment of the gas, monitoring for leakage and measurements to assure that the room is safe to enter are necessary for these systems in the healthcare setting (OSHA, 2005 ) . Data on the compatibility of this process with hospital materials are needed, given ozone ' s known corrosive properties . Chlorine dioxide has a high level of effi cacy against a range of pathogens . However, concerns about safety and material compatibility mean that it is unlikely to be used in healthcare settings , EPA, 2010a .\n\n'Fogging' with various chemicals, including super-oxidised water Galvin et al ., 2012 ) , solutions of H 2 O 2 Tuladhar et al ., 2012 ) and other chemicals De Lorenzi et al ., 2011 ; Friedman et al ., 1968 ; Ostrander and Griffi th, 1964 ) , have been evaluated. These systems are limited by directional introduction of the active agent and consequent non-homogeneous distribution, and the potential for the accumulation of large volumes of chemicals that require post-process removal , with associated risks to operators. Data on compatibility with hospital materials are awaited.\n\nThe performance of different systems can be evaluated by several measures, including compliance with testing standards (such as EN or ASTM standards), in vitro log reduction of bacterial loads, measurement of microbial surface contamination before and after treatment or by the use of BIs with a known concentration of a microbe, typically a bacterial endospore. BIs can be produced in-house or, more reliably, can be purchased commercially (typically containing G. stearothermophilus bacterial endospores). Most NTD systems produce a more signifi cant reduction of bacterial contamination than conventional disinfection Boyce et al ., 2011 ; French et al ., 2004 ; Manian et al ., 2011 ; Nerandzic et al ., 2010 ; Shapey et al ., 2008 ) . However, comparison of the relative effectiveness of different NTD systems is diffi cult because of variations in sample sites (especially orientation and proximity to the NTD device), patient infection or colonisation status, the organism, the microbiological testing methods and the type of pre-cleaning. Thus, the best way to compare different systems is through controlled head-to-head studies (Boyce, 2009 ) , ideally using outcomes related to reduced transmission in clinical settings. However, there have been few studies comparing these outcomes, so it is not possible to evaluate the relative clinical impact of NTD systems using current data. Thus, the available head-to-head studies are currently the most useful way to compare NTD systems.\n\nA recently published study comparing HPV (Bioquell) with an aHP system (ASP Glosair) was performed by St George ' s Hospital, London (Fu et al ., 2012 ) . Testing was performed in a 50 m 3 room with a 13 m 3 anteroom, selected to represent a single occupancy room with a bathroom. Safety was evaluated using a hand-held hydrogen peroxide sensor. The workplace exposure limits (WEL) for H 2 O 2 are 1 ppm as an 8-hour time weighted average, or 2 ppm for 15 minutes as a short-term exposure limit (STEL) (Health and Safety Executive, 2005 ) . The HPV manufacturer mandates re-entering the room only after the measurable concentration of H 2 O 2 is < 1 ppm; the aHP manufacturer recommended room re-entry 2 hours after the start of the cycle. Thus, in this study the mean concentration of H 2 O 2 in the room was measured 2 hours after the cycle started for both systems. The mean H 2 O 2 concentration in the room 2 hours after the cycle started was 2.8 \u00b1 0.8 ppm for aHP, with a maximum reading of 4.5 ppm and no readings < 2 ppm, and 1.3 \u00b1 0.4 ppm for HPV, with no readings > 2 ppm. Thus, for both systems room re-entry must be controlled by measurements of H 2 O 2 concentrations rather than assuming safe levels at the end of the process. A 'controlled leakage' experiment was performed in the St George ' s study to determine whether H 2 O 2 leaked from an unsealed room door. This was only done for the aHP system because the user manuals recommend door and air vent sealing with adhesive tape for the HPV system but not for the aHP. More than 20 ppm H 2 O 2 was detected outside an unsealed door, indicating that doors must be sealed during cycles. These fi ndings also imply that air vents should be sealed during room disinfection with H 2 O 2 systems.\n\nMicrobiological effi cacy was assessed by using commercially available 6-log G. stearothermophilus BIs and in-house prepared test discs inoculated with MRSA, A. baumannii and C. diffi cile (spores) placed at 11 locations around the room (Fu et al ., 2012 ) . In addition, in-house prepared test discs dried in 3% or 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) to simulate dirty conditions were tested in two further room locations. There are no standard testing methods for NTD systems, so the in-house test discs were used to measure log reductions of the common nosocomial pathogens and 6-log and 4-log G. stearothermophilus BIs were used two provide two levels of challenge. HPV inactivated 91% (40/44) of the 6-log and 95% (42/44) of the 4-log G. stearothermophilus BIs. HPV generally achieved a 6-log reduction of the MRSA, A. baumannii and C. diffi cile BIs regardless of room location . aHP inactivated 13.6% (6/44) of the 6-log BIs, and 36.4% of the 4-log BIs. aHP achieved a < 4-log reduction at 2/11 room locations for MRSA, 7/11 for A. baumannii and 2/11 for C. diffi cile spores. The aHP system had reduced effi cacy against the catalase-positive A. baumannii with a < 2-log reductions at 6/11 of room locations. HPV achieved a > 5-log reduction at 11/12 locations with MRSA, A. baumannii or C. diffi cile dried in 3% or 10% BSA compared with 3/12 locations for aHP. This suggests that HPV is more able to penetrate increasing levels of soil, which may be important with sub-optimal pre-cleaning. The log reduction of the in-house prepared test discs varied considerably by room location for aHP but not for HPV, indicating a more uneven distribution of the active agent for aHP.\n\nAnother recent head-to-head study was performed in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, and compared the same HPV and aHP systems. Testing was performed in a 136 m 3 room selected to represent a dual occupancy room. An HPV cycle from a single unit inactivated all 48 6-log G. stearothermophilus BIs distributed around the test room . After three backto-back cycles using two units, 50% of 48 BIs were inactivated by the aHP system. Ninety percent of BIs yielded bacterial growth after the fi rst aHP cycle compared with 21% after both cycles two and three, suggesting poor repeatability. BIs grew in different locations in repeat experiments with the aHP system, suggesting variable distribution. The HPV system was faster than the aHP system, as in the St George ' s study (Fu et al ., 2012 ) .\n\nThe UK Health and Safety Laboratory performed a detailed head-tohead study of six room decontamination technologies including HPV and aHP systems . The microbial challenges (including C. diffi cile spores) were designed to simulate 'worst-case' contamination encountered in laboratories. Organisms were dried onto stainless steel discs and exposed to the decontamination processes in a 35 m 3 room and 105 m 3 laboratory. HPV achieved a 5 to 6-log reduction of C. diffi cile spores in all locations apart from in a wet spillage. aHP achieved a < 1-log reduction for C. diffi cile spores in all room locations. Both systems were less effective than in other studies, probably because the discs were prepared using growth media that provides an additional level of protection for the microorganisms. These authors recommended that 'All systems should be sold with a device for monitoring fumigant levels at the end of a cycle. ' These results indicate that HPV is faster and more effective for biological inactivation than aHP Fu et al ., 2012 ; Holmdahl et al ., 2011 ) . However, the studies reported above were not performed in a clinical setting and did not evaluate surface decontamination directly or the impact on pathogen transmission.\n\nA head-to-head study performed at a US hospital compared HPV (Bioquell) with a UVC system (Tru-D, Lumalier) (Havill et al ., 2012 ) . In-house prepared carrier discs inoculated with \u223c 10 6 C. diffi cile spores and BIs with 10 4 and 10 6 G. stearothermophilus spores were placed in fi ve sites (three sites were not in the direct line of sight of the device). UVC achieved a mean of 2.2 log reduction for C. diffi cile (range 1.7-3 log reduction) and inactivated 29% (22/75) of 4-log BIs (range 7-53%) and 0% (0/75) of 6-log BIs. UVC was signifi cantly less effective out of direct line of sight: it inactivated 42% of 4-log G. stearothermophilus BIs in direct line of sight but only 7% of 4-log BIs out of direct line of sight. HPV achieved a > 6-log reduction for C. diffi cile in all fi ve sites and inactivated 99% (74/75) of 6-log BIs and 100% (75/75) of 4-log BIs. UVC was faster but less effective than HPV for the inactivation of BIs and microbes on surfaces.\n\nNo head-to-head studies comparing aHP and UVC have been published. More head-to-head evaluations of all NTD systems are required, including assessment of clinically relavent outcomes.\n\nNTD systems can be purchased, rented or introduced as part of a service contract. These deployment models have different costs, depending on the package and the frequency of use (Department of Health, 2009 ) .\n\nSeveral factors must be taken into account when considering the cost of NTD systems. For hospitals that purchase their own NTD system, upfront costs include the equipment itself, staff training (and possibly recruitment) and possibly costs associated with equipment storage. Ongoing costs include personnel costs, consumables (such as H 2 O 2 and replacement UV bulbs), depreciation, maintenance and power. For hospitals that choose to purchase a service or other model, manufacturers should be contacted to discuss available options.\n\nFew studies disclose the cost of currently available NTD systems. The Emergency Care Research Institute (ECRI) reports the list price for the Lumalier Tru-D UVC device as \u00a377 190 (US$124 500), the Bioquell HPV system as \u00a327 280 (US$44 000), and the Xenex PX-UV system as \u00a31862 (US$3 000) per month over a 36 month lease (ECRI, 2011) . Thus, the relative purchase cost of equipment is likely to be UVC > PX-UV > H 2 O 2 vapour systems > aHP (ECRI, 2011 ) . Consumables' costs for the hydrogen peroxide systems are likely to be greater than the cost of bulb replacement for the UV systems. Manufacturers should be contacted to provide current prices and purchasing options.\n\nNo studies of the cost-effectiveness of NTD systems have been published. Performing a cost-effectiveness study on the use of an NTD system should consider the direct and indirect costs associated with the system, any impact on rates of infection with their associated costs and other factors (Perencevich et al ., 2007 ) .\n\nCurrent CDC guidelines recommend against routine 'disinfectant fogging' in patient-care areas (Rutala et al ., 2008 ) . This recommendation is currently being re-evaluated by the CDC based on data that have emerged since the guidelines were published and suggest NTD systems may be warranted in some circumstances. The strongest reason for considering an NTD system is to break the chain of transmission by improving terminal disinfection of clinical areas after patients infected or colonised with certain pathogens have been discharged Rutala and Weber, 2011 ) . Key pathogens associated with contamination of the environment include C. diffi cile , VRE, MRSA, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa and norovirus .\n\nBecause of practicality, cost and resource constraints, NTD systems are not suitable for performing disinfection of general clinical areas or daily disinfection of rooms before patients are discharged because of the need for temporary patient relocation. One study evaluated the use of HPV to disinfect the room of a patient colonised with multiple MDROs . The patient was temporarily relocated and his room decontaminated. Decontamination was effective, but the room was recontaminated shortly after the patient returned. Such recontamination was also seen after HPV decontamination of an intensive care unit (ICU) . NTD systems have been used to control endemic infection Rutala and Weber, 2011 ) and outbreaks (Bates and Pearse, 2005 ; Cooper et al ., 2011 ; Dryden et al ., 2008 ; Jeanes et al ., 2005 ; Kaiser et al ., 2011 ; Otter et al ., 2010c ; Ray et al ., 2010 ) . Whilst disinfection of single rooms is more common, NTD systems have been used to disinfect multi-occupancy areas, particularly to remove environmental reservoirs during outbreaks (Bates and Pearse, 2005 ; Boyce et al ., 2008 ; Dryden et al ., 2008 ; Jeanes et al ., 2005 ; Otter et al ., 2010c ) and whole wards have been disinfected in some studies . The different indications for the use of NTD systems are outlined in the following scenarios.\n\n17.6.1 Scenarios when the use of an NTD system may be indicated\n\nThe choice of whether to rely on current cleaning and disinfection methods, enhanced conventional methods or an NTD system will be determined by the clinical scenario. The key factors are whether the area to be disinfected is a single room or a multi-occupancy area, whether the clinical setting is high risk for infection acquisition (e.g. an ICU) or low risk (e.g. a general ward), and the target organism Boyce et al ., 2008 ; Otter et al ., 2010c ; Passaretti et al ., 2013 ; Shapey et al ., 2008 ) . The risk associated with individual pathogens in the context of disinfection will depend on a number of factors, including the importance of environmental contamination in transmission, clinical implications, local epidemiology and fi nancial outcomes. For example, a multidrug-resistant Gram-negative rod or C. diffi cile causing an outbreak would be considered a 'high-risk' pathogen, whereas VRE colonisation would be considered lower risk. Further issues that may need to be considered are the clinical, fi nancial and reputational effects of environmental infections, especially during on-going outbreaks requiring ward closures. Closures may have particular adverse impacts when they involve specialist regional units such as those for neonatal, paediatric or adult intensive care. The disinfection of multi-occupancy bays using NTD systems is constrained by the need to accommodate patients elsewhere during the disinfection process . However, this may be necessary and justifi ed to bring a serious outbreak of high-risk pathogens in high-risk patients under control. It may be practical to use UV systems for the disinfection of single rooms used by patients with low-risk pathogens in low-risk settings Rutala et al ., 2010 ) but practical constraints limit the use of hydrogen peroxide NTD systems in this situation. Conversely, H 2 O 2 vapour systems would be appropriate for dealing with high-risk pathogens in high-risk units because of their high levels of effi cacy, homogeneous distribution and disinfection assurance Manian et al ., 2011 ; Otter et al ., 2010a ) . Examples include on-going outbreaks in intensive care units with NAP1/027 C. diffi cile or a multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogen. UV and hydrogen peroxide systems may be suitable for disinfection of single rooms in low-risk settings with high-risk pathogens or in high-risk settings with low-risk pathogens Boyce et al ., 2008 ; French et al ., 2004 ; Nerandzic et al ., 2010 ; Shapey et al ., 2008 ) . Enhanced conventional disinfection methods should also be employed in these scenarios Datta et al ., 2011 ; Hayden et al ., 2006 ; Mahamat et al ., 2007 ; Mayfi eld et al ., 2000 ; Wilcox et al ., 2003 ) , with the possible exception of high-risk pathogens occurring in high-risk settings where even enhanced conventional disinfection has been shown to leave residual contamination (Datta et al ., 2011 ; Manian et al ., 2011 ; Morter et al ., 2011 ; Wilcox et al ., 2003 ) .\n\nOther potential applications of NTD systems include: the removal of environmental pathogens disturbed during building works such as Aspergillus fumigatus (Vonberg and Gastmeier, 2006 ) ; as part of emergency preparedness planning ; the disinfection of mobile medical equipment in a dedicated facility; and decontamination of emergency vehicles or operating theatres (van ' t Veen et al ., 2005 ) . The widespread need for decontamination of complex mobile medical equipment and furniture, such as blood pressure cuffs, ventilator tubing, wheelchairs, commodes, computers and other electronics (Boyce et al ., 1997 ; Dumford et al ., 2009 ) means that dedicated disinfection rooms incorporating NTD systems are becoming recognised as very useful hospital facilities.\n\nAs with all forms of decontamination, cleaning is required prior to NTD disinfection system use in order to remove organic matter that reduces the effectiveness of NTD systems (Fu et al ., 2012 ; Kac et al ., 2010 ; Otter and French, 2009 ; Pottage et al ., 2010 ; Sweeney and Dancer, 2009 ). The impact of organic matter has been demonstrated by several in vitro studies. For example, Otter et al . evaluated the effi cacy of HPV for the inactivation of MRSA dried on stainless steel discs in suspending media containing 0.3%, 3% and 10% BSA . The effectiveness of HPV was reduced as the concentration of BSA increased. There is evidence that some NTD systems are more susceptible to organic soiling than others. For example, the study by Fu et al . showed that aHP is more susceptible to simulated soiling by BSA than HPV (Fu et al ., 2012 ) .\n\nNevertheless, several studies demonstrate that NTD systems can produce signifi cant reductions in environmental contamination even without precleaning (French et al ., 2004 ; Nerandzic et al ., 2010 ; Rutala et al ., 2010 ) . For example, in one study, 1 site out of 85 sampled yielded MRSA after HPV without pre-cleaning compared with 61 (72%) of 85 matched sites before Decontamination in hospitals and healthcare HPV (French et al ., 2004 ) . In this instance, MRSA was identifi ed by broth enrichment, indicating a low level of contamination, and was cultured from a fl oor corner that was visibly dirty.\n\nOne of the problems with conventional cleaning and disinfection is the diffi culty in validating the processes. The major advantage of NTD systems is the reduction or removal of reliance on the operator to assure adequate distribution and contact time of a disinfectant. It follows that NTD systems should be validated to ensure that their automated processes are effective and repeatable.\n\nNTD systems could be validated by routine microbiological sampling using conventional standards (Dancer, 2004 ) , but this is time consuming, costly and requires microbiological expertise. Another option is the use of BIs, which provide a semi-quantitative measure of microbiological effi cacy and repeatability Holmdahl et al ., 2011 ) . The question remains as to whether 6-log BIs are an appropriate test for validating NTD systems, given that the concentration of contamination on hospital surfaces is usually in the 2-log range Walder and Holmdahl, 2012 ) . Walder and Holmdahl ( 2012 ) argue that soiling and biofi lms (Smith and Hunter, 2008 ; Vickery et al ., 2012 ) , occasional higher levels of contamination (Morter et al ., 2011 ) , the occurrence of pathogens with reduced susceptibility to certain agents and the potential for incomplete distribution (Fu et al ., 2012 ; Havill et al ., 2012 ; Holmdahl et al ., 2011 ) mean that 6-log BIs are an appropriate target for NTD systems. Recent evidence published by Pottage et al . ( 2012 ) and others Fu et al ., 2012 ; Otter and French, 2009 ) indicating that catalase-positive bacteria are less susceptible to hydrogen peroxidebased NTD systems than bacterial endospores provides a further reason to use stringent challenges for these systems .\n\nThe US EPA requires a hospital disinfectant to achieve a > 6-log reduction of certain vegetative bacteria in vitro (EPA, 2010b ) . This is higher than the concentration typically found on hospital surfaces, presumably to provide assurance that the disinfectant will be effective in the 'real world'.\n\nThe inactivation of 6-log BIs correlates well with the elimination of pathogens from surfaces and can be used as a test standard for NTD systems when the elimination of pathogens is required Walder and Holmdahl, 2012 ) . H 2 O 2 vapour systems can eliminate pathogens from surfaces, produce a > 6-log reduction of a range of pathogens in vitro and can inactivate 6-log BIs French et al ., 2004 ; Otter and French, 2009 ; Otter et al ., 2010c ) . aHP, UVC and PX-UV are much less effective in these tests (Andersen et al ., 2006 ; Barbut et al ., 2009 ; Boyce et al ., 2011 ; Fu et al ., 2012 ; Holmdahl et al ., 2011 ; Nerandzic et al ., 2010 ; Rutala et al ., 2010 ; Shapey et al ., 2008 ) . However, further studies are necessary to determine the level of pathogen reduction required to interrupt transmission and set the appropriate clinical decontamination standard for NTD systems.\n\nGiven the relatively recent introduction of NTD systems into the marketplace, regulatory standards have not been established. In Europe, the regulation of disinfectants is in fl ux because of the phased introduction of the biocidal products directive (BPD) (Low, 2011 ) . Testing standards are generally not specifi ed for NTD systems, although a French standard for testing NTD systems, NF72-281, is currently under evaluation for adoption as a European standard. Currently, it is not clear how the BPD will infl uence NTD systems, although the NTDs will need to be assessed and registered as with any other disinfectant.\n\nIn the UK, the Health and Safety Executive, Department of Health (DH), Health Protection Agency (HPA) and various professional societies have a role to play in the regulation of NTD systems. In England, the DH and HPA have established a expert group called the Rapid Review Panel (RRP) to evaluate products claiming to be useful in healthcare applications (Department of Health, 2009 ) . The RRP has issued several recommendations on NTD systems. These provide independent, evidencebased recommendations that can guide decision making about such products. The RRP has issued the following recommendations about NTD systems (which are available at http://www.hpa.org.uk/ProductsServices/ MicrobiologyPathology/RapidReviewPanel/ ):\n\n\u2022 Bioquell HPV (recommendation 1): Basic research and development, validation and recent in use evaluations have shown benefi ts that should be available to NHS bodies to include as appropriate in their cleaning, hygiene or infection control protocols. \u2022 Steris VHP (recommendation 2): Basic research and development has been completed and the product may have potential value; in use evaluations/trials are now needed in an NHS clinical setting. \u2022 aHP system; Sterinis, now ASP Glosair (recommendation 3):\n\nA potentially useful new concept but insuffi ciently validated; more research and development is required before it is ready for evaluation in practice.\n\nIn the US, the EPA regulates disinfectant use and will likely regulate NTD systems. The EPA issued an order to stop a US hospital using a disinfectant fogger in ambulances on safety grounds (EPA, 2011 ). The EPA sought information from some US professional societies and the published open correspondence between the US EPA, Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA), Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) and Association for the Healthcare Environment (AHE) (SHEA/APIC/AHA, 2011) illustrates that healthcare regulators and professional societies are beginning to take an interest in NTD systems. Similarly, ANSM (previously AFSSAPS), the French regulatory body, has withdrawn several NTD systems, including an aHP system, from the French market due to a lack of effi cacy data (AFSSAPS, 2011 ) .\n\nRegulators and professional societies will be required to make recommendations on issues such as nomenclature of NTD systems, acceptability of testing standards and guidance on safe and effective applications. Nomenclature is already confused. For example, the Oxypharm Nocospray aHP system has been incorrectly referred to Otter et al ., 2010b ) as using 'hydrogen peroxide vapour' and correctly as using an aerosol of hydrogen peroxide . Such confusion in describing the various different NTD systems is also evident in several review papers , Falagas et al ., 2011 .\n\nIt is likely that the literature evaluating the role of contaminated surfaces in the transmission of nosocomial pathogens will continue to expand. A better understanding of the role of contaminated surfaces in transmission will help to target interventions aimed at improving cleaning and disinfection most effectively. However, at the current time, we do not know the relationship between the level of residual contamination and infection. Ideally, the target should be zero contamination; however, practicalities require a risk-based approach.\n\nInitial studies of systematic improvement of enhanced conventional cleaning methods can reduce transmission to some degree but they often continue to fail because they are dependent on human skill and performance, which cannot be guaranteed. Automated NTD systems are potentially an effective and effi cient adjunct to decontaminating complex environmental surfaces. As the evidence base grows, the indications and cost-effectiveness of NTD systems will become clearer. At present, there is good evidence that terminal disinfection of clinical areas used by patients colonised or infected with pathogens associated with environmental contamination can reduce or eliminate the risk of onward transmission to others, and it is in this situation where NTD systems can be most useful. The choice of system will depend on practicalities and cost effectiveness. However, more head-to-head comparisons are needed to compare both microbiological and clinical outcomes to allow better evidence-based decisions.\n\nTechnological developments mean that existing NTD systems will become more refi ned. For example, improvement in aeration capacity has reduced HPV process times from > 4 hours (French et al ., 2004 ) to < 2 hours for a single room (Barbut et al ., 2012 ; Otter and Yezli, 2010 ) . Also, the use of UV refl ective paint could reduce the impact of line-of-sight issues for UV systems (Rutala, 2012 ) . In addition, there seems to be a natural synergy between the use of NTD systems and antimicrobial surfaces or air disinfection systems, which can help to reduce the extent of surface contamination during the stay of a patient (Sexton et al ., 2006 ; Weber and Rutala, 2012 ) . The emergence of novel NTD systems, combining rapid cycle times with high-level effi cacy, would broaden the potential application of NTD systems.\n\nThere is now evidence that existing NTD systems are an effective adjunct to conventional methods of terminal disinfection, and that H 2 O 2 vapour systems reduce transmission in endemic and epidemic settings. Further evidence on the optimal application and cost effectiveness of NTD systems in healthcare is required, but NTD systems are already beginning to be integrated into hospital disinfection policies Passaretti et al ., 2013 ) . Regulators and professional bodies should decide on the terminology and insist on standardisation for these systems and, as adoption and the evidence-base grows, the role of regulators and professional societies will become increasingly important in the provision of advice and guidelines to ensure the safe and effective use of NTD systems in healthcare settings (Department of Health and Health Protection Agency, 2009 ; Rutala et al ., 2008 ) .\n\nCurrent data on NTD systems in the academic literature is limited but increasing (Fig. 17.1 ) . Academic reviews of NTD systems can provide useful background data, for example, those by Otter et al . ( 2013 ) , Davies et al . ( 2011 ) and Falagas et al . ( 2011 ) . In addition, publications in the non-peer reviewed literature and by research institutes can provide useful background information. For example, the ECRI Institute ( 2011 ) and Infection Control Today (Pyrek, 2011 ) have published useful guidance documents. In addition, several studies of NTD systems with clinical outcomes are currently in progress, including a CDC-funded assessment of a UVC system. b These studies will be important in determining the appropriate use of the various"}
