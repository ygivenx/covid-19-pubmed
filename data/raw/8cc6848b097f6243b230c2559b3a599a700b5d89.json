{"title": "A Social Network Model of the COVID-19 Pandemic", "body": "From December 31, 2019 to March 18, 2020, the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV2) coronavirus pandemic has infected a reported 209,839 number of people, resulting in 8,778 deaths, in 168 countries around the world, and continue to spread exponentially 1 . While the world awaits the development of vaccines and anti-viral medications, traditional public health measures such as isolation of confirmed or suspected cases, quarantine of contacts, and social distancing of the public are effective measures to reduce viral transmission 2, 3 , that have been implemented in many regions and countries 4, 5 .\n\nCOVID-19 is a respiratory infection transmitted by aerosol, droplet, contact, and oral-fecal routes, through networks of social contact. A social network can be visualized as a weighted graph, where vertices represent individuals and edges represent the amount of contact 6 . In the U.S., for example, a pair of individuals can be connected by an average of 6 acquaintances, commonly known as 6 degrees of separation. This small world phenomenon directly affects the spread of COVID-19.\n\nConceptually, an epidemic is dependent on network connectivity and time 7 . As edges of contact are removed, the average degree of each vertex declines, and connectivity falls. Practically, viral transmission is attenuated by isolation, quarantine and social distancing 8, 9, 10 . These public health measures decrease the number of close contacts, resulting in higher degrees of separation within the public, thereby impeding transmission. This paper examines the level of public health measures needed to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn general, let graph g represent a weighted network of social contacts. Suppose that it contains n vertices, V1 to Vn, representing n individuals. For a pair of connected vertices Vi and Vj, let eij be their common edge with weight wij. If Vi has degree k, then it carries a weighted value of = \u2211 , summed over its k edges. Let k\u0305 be the average of degree of each vertex and d\u0305 be the average degree of separation of g. Then, d\u0305 \u2248 log n / log k\u0305 .\n\nWe begin by modelling viral transmission on g. Suppose individual i is infected and had contact with k other individuals. Let wij be the probability of disease transmission between individuals i and j. Then vi is the reproductive number for individual i, that is, the average number of secondary infections stemming from i. For instance, super-spreading occurs at densely connected vertices, while viral transmission is likely to terminate at sparsely connected vertices.\n\nIn a dynamic network, where edges are added and removed, these parameters vary with time corresponding to changes in social behavior. For example, case isolation decreases the degree of Vi, while quarantine decreases the degree of vertices connected to Vi. Universal precautions such as wearing masks reduces the probability of transmission, wij.\n\nThe following assumptions are based on literature review and expert opinion and represent the current knowledge of COVID-19 epidemiology. The values of these parameters often differ by study.\n\nThe average generation interval of COVID-19 is about 5 days 11, 12, 13 . (Note that estimates of reproductive numbers are proportional to the assumed generation time.) On average, it take patients 2 days after the start of the infectious period, which can precede symptoms, to seek medical care or report illness 14 . Among sick contacts, 80% are traced by public health and quarantined at home. When individuals practice social distancing such as staying at home, contacts will spend more time with each other by a factor of 1.5. For example, a person who usually spends 12 hours a day with family now spends 18 hours with them. For cases isolated at home, routine precautions reduce household transmission by 50%.\n\nUsing COVID-19 epidemic data from China, the initial epicenter of the outbreak, we will derive parameters for the social network model. First, based on a population study of social mixing patterns in China 15 , the mean number of contacts with unique individuals, over the generation time of COVID-19, is 36, population degree of separation 5.88. Then strict social distancing limits contacts to the household setting and shopping for essential supplies, i.e., 6.3 unique individuals (3.3 in household and 3 in nonhousehold settings), degree of separation 11.5. (See supplementary materials.) Confirmed COVID-19 patients were hospitalized or admitted to isolation centers. Then using open-access daily case reports 16 , we calculate the daily mean reproductive number of the COVID-19 epidemic (Figure 1 ).\n\n.

Therefore, the average probability of infection between two contacts is 10.7%, 35.1% for contacts in the household setting versus 8.26% in non-household settings. (See supplementary materials for calculations.) After public health measures are implemented under baseline assumptions, the daily mean reproductive number decreases from 3.86 to 1.99 by social distancing, to 0.79 by isolating all cases at medical facilities, and to 0.41 by quarantine of case contacts, corresponding to the trajectory in Figure 1 . During the social distancing period, 81% of new cases are predicted to be through household transmission.\n\nIn Europe, Italy has become the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic 18 . From population studies of social patterns in Italy 19 , during the viral generation period, an infected individual is estimated to have k\u0305 = 28.5 distinct close contacts, 3.6 contacts in the household setting and 24.9 in non-household settings. degree of separation 5.35. The predicted R0 is 3.31. (See supplementary materials for calculations.) Again, we calculate the daily mean reproductive numbers based on open-access daily case reports 1 (Figure 2 ). The observed R0 is 2.99.\n\n.

Initial social distancing is estimated to reduce contacts from 28.5 to 11.5, that is, an average of 3.6 contacts in the household setting and 7.9 in the non-household setting, degree of separation 7.35. Furthermore, the entire population is quarantined at home, with moderate to severe cases (20%) hospitalized. Therefore, assuming full compliance with social distancing, the reproductive number is predicted to be 1.03. (See supplementary materials for calculations.) After shutting down all non-essential businesses on March 21, the average number of unique contacts per individual over each viral generation period is expected to be 6.6, leading to a predicted reproductive number of 0.97, to be seen in the coming week.\n\nIn the U.S., we did not find recent publications on population-level studies of social patterns. Therefore, we assumed that U.S. social patterns are similar to that of Europe 19 . During the viral generation interval, an infected individual is estimated to have k\u0305 = 19.3 distinct contacts, 2.95 in the household setting and 16.35 in non-household settings, and d\u0305 = 6.63 degrees of separation. Thus, the predicted R0 = 2.39. (See supplementary materials for calculations.) The initial observed reproductive number became higher than predicted due to travel-acquired infection on top of community transmission. On March 11, the U.S. issued a travel restriction to Europe 5 , that would later include the U.K. After March 17, wide-spread viral testing in the community identified a wave of new cases.\n\n.

Of confirmed cases, patients with moderate to severe illness (20%) are hospitalized, while patients with mild illness (80%) are isolated at home. Then to contain the epidemic, in addition to public health measures such as contact tracing and quarantine, the average number of unique close contacts per person should be less than 7 over the 5 day generation interval of COVID-19, (3 household contacts and 4 non-household contacts). (See supplementary materials for calculations.) This increases the degrees of separation to 10.\n\nLastly, we calculate the threshold above which prolonged social distancing measures are needed. Without social distancing, if a single individual is infected with COVID-19, the average probability that any given person will be infected is (R0/k\u0305 ) d = (2.39/19.3) 6.63 = 0.967 \u00d7 10 -6 , or 1 in 1.03 million. Thus, if 1.03 million people become infected in the U.S., then it is likely that the epidemic will reach every person through networks of social contact, unless social distancing is kept in place until vaccines and anti-viral medications become available.\n\nThis paper provides heuristic estimates of COVID-19 epidemiology without knowing the detailed structure of the social network. For large networks, estimates using parameter averages can be robust. There are also numerous factors influencing viral transmission. This simplified model only includes main variables affecting the epidemiology of communicable diseases. Other factors to consider in the future include patient age, sex, pre-existing medical conditions, additional settings of contact such as various workplaces, restaurants, nursing homes, just to name a few. As more factors are taken into consideration, the social network model can be refined to provide more accurate predictions.\n\n.

It shows the importance of social distancing, and the message that to contain the epidemic, every member of the public plays a crucial part in breaking the chain of transmission.\n\nGiven the current understanding of COVID-19 viral epidemiology, the epidemic in the U.S. can be controlled by limiting the average number of contacts per person to 7 unique individuals over each 5 day period. For an average American family, the 7 contacts might be a spouse, two children, a friend, a neighbor, a colleague, and a cashier during grocery shopping. The time from the beginning of collective social action to the inflection point of the epidemic is about 3 viral generation intervals, totaling 2-3 weeks. Once daily new cases are decreasing, social distancing measures can be gradually relaxed, in phases, to prevent rebound of viral transmission.\n\nAfter social distancing becomes widely implemented and most people stay at home, the majority of new cases is expected to be from household transmission. One way to further reduce the epidemic is to bring all patients with confirmed COVID-19 to medical facilities to prevent the spread of infection at home, as was the practice in China, where moderate to severe cases were hospitalized while mild cases were kept in isolation centers until they were no longer infectious on viral nucleic acid testing. This is also the standard of care for other communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, where clinically stable patients are discharged home after three negative induced sputum samples.\n\nFinally, the social network model of COVID-19 transmission is expandable and extendable. This paper provides a simplified version using population averages for parameters. Researchers who have access to patient-level data can substitute these average values by their respective probability distributions to simulate stochastic viral transmission.\n\n.
