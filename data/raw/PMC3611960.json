{"title": "Modulation of NF-\u03baB signalling by microbial pathogens", "body": "The nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) family of transcription factors regulates the expression of hundreds of genes that are associated with diverse cellular processes, such as proliferation, differentiation and death, as well as innate and adaptive immune responses. The mammalian NF-\u03baB proteins are members of the Rel domain-containing protein family: RELA (also known as p65), RELB, c-REL, the NF-\u03baB p105 subunit (also known as NF-\u03baB1; which is cleaved into the p50 subunit) and the NF-\u03baB p100 subunit (also known as NF-\u03baB2; which is cleaved into the p52 subunit); these proteins can homodimerize or heterodimerize through their conserved Rel homology domain to mediate gene transcription1,2. NF-\u03baB proteins are activated by a variety of diverse extracellular or intracellular stimuli, including microbial pathogens and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)3. The NF-\u03baB signalling pathway is an attractive target for exploitation by microbial pathogens in order to modulate host cell events, as activation of NF-\u03baB is such a rapid response. Cytoplasmic NF-\u03baB complexes are transferred to the nucleus within minutes after exposure to a pathogen or PAMPs, even in the absence of de novo protein synthesis, and induce the expression of a broad spectrum of antimicrobial pro-inflammatory cellular response genes4,5. The central role of these transcription factors in pathogen defence is highlighted by the fact that the NF-\u03baB signalling cascade is probably the most frequently targeted intracellular pathway for subversion by anti-immune modulators that are encoded by a wide spectrum of microbial pathogens4. In this Review, we describe some of the recent advances in our understanding of the various mechanisms used by pathogens to modulate NF-\u03baB signalling.\n\n\nSignalling targets upstream of NF-\u03baB\n\n\nNF-\u03baB proteins are tightly regulated in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus6. Under normal physiological conditions, NF-\u03baB complexes remain inactive in the cytoplasm through a direct interaction with proteins of the inhibitor of NF-\u03baB (I\u03baB) family, including I\u03baB\u03b1, I\u03baB\u03b2 and I\u03baB\u025b (also known as NF-\u03baBI\u03b1, NF-\u03baBI\u03b2 and NF-\u03baBI\u025b, respectively); I\u03baB proteins mask the nuclear localization domains in the NF-\u03baB complex, thus retaining the transcription complex in the cytoplasm. In response to diverse stimuli, various cellular immune receptors (such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs)) and cytokine receptors (such as the interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1Rs), TNF receptors (TNFRs) and other TNFR-like receptors) can rapidly activate the NF-\u03baB complex following the appropriate pro-inflammatory stimulation. This activation is mediated by a signalling cascade that uses multiple adaptors (including TNFR-associated factors (TRAFs), myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MYD88) and TIR domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP)), as well as intermediate transducing molecules and kinases (including IL-1R-associated kinases (IRAKs), receptor-interacting proteins (RIPs; also known as RIPKs) and NF-\u03baB-inducing kinase (NIK; also known as MAP3K14)), to eventually lead to degradation of the inhibitory protein I\u03baB\u03b1, thus liberating the NF-\u03baB complexes for transport to the nucleus, where they undergo further layers of regulation7 (Fig. 1).\n\nThe receptor-mediated signalling events converge on the same core components of the NF-\u03baB activation apparatus: the I\u03baB kinase (IKK) complex, which is composed of two catalytic subunits, IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2, and a regulatory subunit, NEMO (NF-\u03baB essential modulator; also known as IKK\u03b3)8,9. Activation of the IKK complex induces phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1, followed by ubiquitylation by a specific cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL) family SCF\u03b2TRCP complex, which contains SKP1 (S phase kinase-associated protein 1), cullin 1 and the F-box protein \u03b2TRCP as substrate adaptor; this SCF\u03b2TRCP complex specifically recognizes and degrades I\u03baB\u03b1 that is phosphorylated on Ser32 and Ser36. As well as processing I\u03baB\u03b1, the ubiquitylation\u2013proteasome pathway is important for the processing of NF-\u03baB subunits p105 and p100 to p50 and p52, respectively10. In addition to the IKK complex, members of the IKK family of kinases \u2014 including IKKi (inducible IKK; also known as IKK\u025b) and TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase 1) \u2014 can activate the NF-\u03baB pathway in response to microbial infection11. TBK1 interacts with TANK, a TRAF-binding protein that activates NF-\u03baB by modulating the function of TRAF2 and that also interacts with IKKi. TBK1 enhances the enzymatic activity of IKK\u03b2 by direct phosphorylation, and thus contributes to NF-\u03baB activation12. Because of the essential role of IKKs and I\u03baB\u03b1 in the activation and regulation of NF-\u03baB signalling, these proteins (or their post-translational modifications) are often targeted directly by microbial pathogens to control the host immune responses.\n\nThe NF-\u03baB pathway is classified as either classical (canonical) or alternative (non-canonical) on the basis of the IKK subunits that get activated by upstream kinases13,14 (Fig. 1). In the classical pathway (for example, triggered by TNFR1 signalling), IKK\u03b2 and NEMO become activated by adaptors (such as TRAFs) and then phosphorylate p105 and I\u03baB\u03b1 to release the prototypical heterodimer p50\u2013RELA. In the alternative pathway (for example, triggered by lymphotoxin-\u03b2 receptor), IKK\u03b1 is activated by NIK and then phosphorylates p100, which is subsequently cleaved to form p52. p52 then forms a heterodimer with RELB and translocates to the nucleus. This alternative pathway is triggered by a subset of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) family members, including CD40, lymphotoxin-\u03b2, B cell-activating factor (BAFF), receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand (RANKL) and TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK). By contrast, inflammatory cytokines, genotoxic stress, antigens and TLR stimulation tend to activate the classical pathway. Both the classical and alternative pathways are modulated by microbial pathogens, as the two pathways induce coordinated immune responses following diverse infections.\n\n\nOutcome of NF-\u03baB activation\n\n\nActivation of NF-\u03baB is considered to be the central initiating cellular event of host responses to invasion by microbial pathogens. The presence of a functional NF-\u03baB signalling cascade in the horseshoe crab, a species that is known as a 'living fossil', suggests that the proteins involved are the evolutionarily conserved immune defence molecules15, and highlights the central role of NF-\u03baB in upregulating the expression of genes encoding chemokines, cytokines, adhesion molecules (such as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1)), enzymes that produce secondary inflammatory mediators, and inhibitors of apoptosis. These molecules are key components of the innate immune response to invading microorganisms and are required for the migration of inflammatory and phagocytic cells to the site of infection, where NF-\u03baB has been activated. The activated phagocytic cells kill, ingest and degrade microbial pathogens and eventually present the antigens to T cells after they re-migrate to secondary lymphoid organs. The secreted cytokines, including TNF and IL-1\u03b2, also start a feedback loop for a second phase of NF-\u03baB activation that continues the induction of robust immune responses. The cellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as TLRs, RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs), which all sense microbial pathogens and PAMPs, use distinct signalling pathways that eventually converge to activate NF-\u03baB16, leading to the production of inflammatory mediators.\n\nThe initiation of innate immune events is important in host resistance to many different types of pathogens prior to the activation of adaptive immune responses, which are also mediated by NF-\u03baB. In addition, NF-\u03baB plays a part in the suppression of apoptosis induced by bacterial components such as lipopolysaccharide. The importance of NF-\u03baB in protection against pathogens is also supported by the fact that NF-\u03baB complexes are abundantly expressed in myeloid cells, which are mostly dedicated to innate immunity. The importance of members of the NF-\u03baB family in both the immune response against pathogens and the development and function of other immune cells has been demonstrated by sequentially knocking down the expression levels of these proteins17. Mice lacking different NF-\u03baB family members become susceptible to various viral, bacterial and parasitic infections (Table 1). In addition, IKK and IKK-related kinases also play an important part in regulating antimicrobial responses11,18. As a result, pathogens have developed various mechanisms to alter the activation of NF-\u03baB. Here, we focus on the mechanisms by which viruses and bacteria modulate NF-\u03baB activation.\n\n\nModulation of NF-\u03baB by viruses\n\n\nNF-\u03baB-dependent genes are important for regulating cellular processes such as apoptosis, inflammation and immune responses, and so many viruses have acquired diverse strategies to regulate NF-\u03baB signalling19. Some viruses regulate NF-\u03baB in a biphasic manner to optimize viral replication in the infected cells during different phases of the viral life cycle. For example, some viruses (such as the gammaherpesviruses Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV)) activate NF-\u03baB during latency, whereas they tend to suppress NF-\u03baB signalling during the lytic cycle20. By contrast, viruses such as Sindbis virus, dengue virus and reoviruses activate NF-\u03baB to facilitate the induction of apoptosis, which increases viral spread via phagocytic myeloid cells. However, more often, viruses inhibit NF-\u03baB primarily to dampen host inflammatory and immune responses, often by encoding multiple proteins that target the pathways at multiple levels21,22,23. Larger DNA viruses, such as poxviruses, frequently deploy several proteins to regulate NF-\u03baB in cultured cells in a seemingly redundant manner, whereas smaller RNA viruses may encode only a single protein that has multiple roles in regulating NF-\u03baB. Tables 2,3 list some of the NF-\u03baB modulators that are derived from viruses.\n\n\nActivation of NF-\u03baB by viruses\n\n\nSome viruses have evolved mechanisms to pro-actively stimulate NF-\u03baB activation19,21,24. Viruses such as HIV-1, human T-lymphotrophic virus 1 (HTLV-1), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), rotaviruses, influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSVs) activate NF-\u03baB to promote viral replication and to pre-empt virus-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2). These viral genomes all possess strategic gene promoters with NF-\u03baB-binding sites and, thus, activated NF-\u03baB is crucial for viral gene expression, replication and spread. Infections with RSVs, the causative agents of acute respiratory diseases such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia, are associated with excessive inflammation caused by the release of NF-\u03baB-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by airway epithelial cells25. This occurs because the infection induces a persistent activation of both classical and alternative NF-\u03baB pathways25. The classical NF-\u03baB pathway is activated by the host superoxide-generating enzyme NOX2-containing NADPH oxidase, which phosphorylates I\u03baB\u03b1 and RELA in airway epithelial cells via RIG-I (also known as DDX58), TRAF6 and IKK\u03b226. However, the alternative NF-\u03baB pathway is activated by the kinases NIK and IKK\u03b1, leading to the nuclear translocation of p52\u2013RELB27. This suggests that the redox modification mediated by RSVs might have multiple upstream targets that then lead to the activation of both NF-\u03baB pathways. Two of the RSV proteins, fusion glycoprotein F and M2-1, have been shown to activate NF-\u03baB-mediated cytokine induction in monocytic cells28,29.\n\nThe HIV-1 proteins Tat, Vpr and Nef activate the NF-\u03baB pathway by exploiting multiple mechanisms. Tat, a transcriptional activator, induces transcription of cytokines such as IL-10, IL-6 and TNF in monocytes or macrophages; these cytokines promote HIV-1 replication at early stages of infection30. Tat also increases the DNA-binding activity of NF-\u03baB complexes by promoting acetylation of p50 via the CREBBP\u2013p300 complex31. However, recent studies have demonstrated that Tat also can inhibit NF-\u03baB activation, as discussed below. Vpr, a viral late protein, and Nef, a viral early protein, enhance virion infectivity and increase viral replication. These viral proteins can activate the NF-\u03baB pathway when added exogenously and stimulate the transcription of HIV-1 genes in promonocytic cells and primary macrophages32,33.\n\nMany oncogenic viruses activate NF-\u03baB to facilitate transformation of infected cells. In most cases, virus-encoded oncoproteins are directly involved in this activation process. Among the oncoproteins identified so far, the mechanisms of persistent NF-\u03baB activation by Tax1 from HTLV-1 and Tax2 from HTLV-2 during T cell leukaemia are well established34,35. Tax1 primarily activates the IKK complex by directly interacting with the non-catalytic subunit, NEMO36. In addition, Tax1 modulates the activity of kinases that activate the IKK complex, such as MEK kinase 1 (MEKK1; also known as MAP3K1), NIK and TGF\u03b2-activated kinase 1 (TAK1; also known as MAP3K7) (Ref. 37). Recently, it was demonstrated that Tax1 sequesters the activated IKK complex in lipid rafts through its interaction with NEMO, providing an optimal microenvironment for kinase activation and thus allowing constitutive activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway38. Unlike Tax2, Tax1 also modulates the alternative NF-\u03baB pathway by upregulating IKK\u03b1 in T cells, thereby inducing the processing of p100 (Ref. 39). Another member of the Retroviridae, bovine foamy virus (BFV), activates the classical and alternative NF-\u03baB pathways using the viral transactivator BTas, which interacts with IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 and persistently activates NF-\u03baB40.\n\nEBV, a human gammaherpesvirus that causes multiple types of cancer, is a strong inducer of NF-\u03baB activation. During the early phase of infection, the binding of EBV glycoprotein gp350 (or its alternative isoform, gp250) to the cellular receptors CD21 (also known as CR2) and TLR2 causes persistent activation of the classical NF-\u03baB pathway41. At later stages of EBV infection, B cells are immortalized, in part owing to the activation of NF-\u03baB by viral latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), which mimics a constitutively activated TNFR42. LMP1 activates both the alternative and the classical NF-\u03baB pathways using its carboxy-terminal activation region 1 (CTAR1) and CTAR2, respectively43,44. CTAR2 interacts with TRAF6, TRADD and RIP1, which activate IKK\u03b2 and NEMO45, thus activating the classical NF-\u03baB pathway, whereas CTAR1 interacts with TRAF2 and TRAF3, which activate NIK and IKK\u03b1, thus activating the alternative pathway46; in fact, the identification of these signalling molecules using LMP1 led to the identification of the alternative NF-\u03baB pathway. However, recent studies suggest that additional mechanisms are involved in LMP1-mediated activation of NF-\u03baB47.\n\nSimilarly to EBV, KSHV, another human oncogenic gammaherpesvirus, establishes latent infection by activating NF-\u03baB. The K13 protein, known as vFLIP, is one of the proteins that regulates the latency of KSHV. vFLIP interacts with NEMO in the IKK complex to activate classical NF-\u03baB signalling48. In addition, vFLIP blocks KSHV lytic replication by antagonizing the KSHV lytic genes, including RTA (replication and transcription activator) and vGPCR, by binding to their promoters49. Moreover, activation of NF-\u03baB by vFLIP suppresses the host AP1 pathway, which is essential for KSHV lytic replication50, and upregulates the expression of miR-146a, which suppresses the expression of CXCR4, a CXC-chemokine receptor for stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF1; also known as CXCL12); the suppression of CXCR4 may enhance the spread of KSHV-infected endothelial cells51. Thus, vFLIP has multiple roles in the regulation of cellular gene expression in order to maintain the fine balance between latency and lytic replication.\n\nSome gammaherpesviruses that cause lymphoma in New World primates harbour several oncoproteins that activate NF-\u03baB and transform human T cells. The oncoproteins Saimiri transformation-associated protein C (StpC) and StpA11 of herpesvirus saimiri induce TRAF2 and TRAF6 and activate both NF-\u03baB pathways52,53,54. Tio, an oncoprotein from herpesvirus ateles (a virus that causes T cell malignancies in primates), also activates both NF-\u03baB pathways using TRAF6 to activate the IKK complex54.\n\nSome viruses modulate the kinases associated with the NF-\u03baB pathway to promote transcription of their own genes. Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MuHV-68), which establishes long-term latent infection in the mouse spleen, initiates lytic replication using its RTA protein (encoded by ORF50) in latently infected cells. MuHV-68 activates IKK\u03b2 in a MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral-signalling protein)-dependent manner through phosphorylation of RTA, to promote the lytic replication cycle55, although a previous study reported that the NF-\u03baB pathway is dispensable for MuHV-68 lytic replication56. HBV, which causes hepatocellular carcinoma (the most common form of liver cancer in adults), can persistently activate NF-\u03baB using the transcriptional transactivator protein HBx (also known as protein X)57. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the induction of NF-\u03baB target genes by HBx, including direct targeting of the NF-\u03baB components and, as an indirect route, activation of cellular kinases that induce transcription of cellular genes containing \u03baB elements (sequences to which NF-\u03baB binds) in their promoters58. A complex consisting of HBx and RELA can activate the gene encoding metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1), which is a master chromatin modifier, and can regulate cancer progression, indicating the importance of NF-\u03baB upregulation59. HCV, which causes acute and chronic hepatitis, also persistently activates NF-\u03baB, leading to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The core and NS3 proteins of HCV activate NF-\u03baB by activating TNFR1 and TLRs60. Apart from using oncoproteins, viruses use homologues of cellular anti-apoptotic proteins as a survival strategy; for example, the African swine fever virus (ASFV) inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP), A224L, can activate NF-\u03baB using TRAF2 and IKK\u03b2, and can thus prevent apoptosis61.\n\nOther viruses, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) spp. and HIV-1, activate NF-\u03baB in a biphasic manner for viral infection and replication. The early phase of NF-\u03baB activation happens independently of viral replication, whereas the second phase requires viral gene expression. In the case of HSV, the early phase of NF-\u03baB activation is mediated by envelope glycoprotein D and involves the host protein herpesvirus entry mediator A (HVEA)62 and the viral tegument protein UL37, which binds to TRAF6 during entry63. After entry, the HSV immediate\u2013early proteins ICP4 and ICP27 start the second phase of NF-\u03baB activation in a TLR-independent manner64.\n\n\nSuppression of receptors and NF-\u03baB adaptors\n\n\nViruses suppress NF-\u03baB activation to dampen the host immune responses and, in some cases, to maintain latency. Multiple virus-encoded proteins have been identified that inhibit NF-\u03baB activation by targeting the inducer ligands, receptors or sensors that activate innate responses, the downstream adaptor molecules in these pathways, or the kinases that activate the NF-\u03baB pathways (Fig. 3). As mentioned above, some viruses (for example, HSV spp.), maintain a delicate balance between activation and suppression of NF-\u03baB in order to maintain long-term persistence. Activation of NF-\u03baB is required to start the infection and viral replication; however, NF-\u03baB signalling also promotes the expression of inflammatory cytokines, and several viral proteins \u2014 the immediate\u2013early proteins of HSV, for example \u2014 block NF-\u03baB activation at a later stage to ensure a smooth progression of infection. The HSV immediate\u2013early protein ICP0, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, reduces TLR2-mediated inflammatory responses against the virus by inducing degradation of the adaptor protein MYD88 (Ref. 65), whereas ICP27, another immediate\u2013early protein, represses NF-\u03baB function by stabilizing I\u03baB\u03b1 through blockade of its phosphorylation and ubiquitylation66. This suggests that bifunctional viral proteins such as ICP27, which activate as well as suppress NF-\u03baB, have complex regulatory duties that function to maintain a delicate balance between advantageous and deleterious host responses.\n\nHCV establishes persistent intra-hepatic infection using multiple proteins to either activate NF-\u03baB and stimulate viral replication, or inhibit NF-\u03baB and suppress the expression of its target host defence genes. The NS3\u2013NS4A protease of HCV causes proteolysis of TRIF (TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN\u03b2; also known as TICAM1), an adaptor protein used by TLR3 and MAVS, and this proteolysis inhibits NF-\u03baB and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)67,68. Another HCV protein, phosphoprotein NS5A, interacts with MYD88 and TRAF2 in macrophage cell lines and inhibits the TLR2-, TLR4-, TLR7- and TLR9-mediated activation of NF-\u03baB69. However, NS5A from bovine viral diarrhoea virus, a member of the Flaviviridae that is closely related to HCV, modulates host immune responses by interaction with NIK- and IKK\u03b2-binding protein (NIBP; also known as TRAPPC9) in LB9.K cells70, suggesting that related viral immunomodulatory molecules might have multiple cellular targets to regulate NF-\u03baB in different ways, depending on the host. Among the other HCV proteins, NS5B and the core proteins interact with IKKs and inhibit activation of the IKK complex71,72.\n\nViruses frequently target IKKs to mediate NF-\u03baB inhibition, as diverse signalling pathways converge on these kinases. SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which causes life-threatening atypical pneumonia, modulates signalling through IKK and subsequently interrupts NF-\u03baB activation via viral membrane (M) protein73. M protein physically interacts with IKK\u03b2, thereby suppressing TNF-induced activation of NF-\u03baB and the subsequent expression of cyclooxygenase 2, an enzyme that is known to have an antiviral function73. In a similar manner, the EBV protein EBNA1 inhibits phosphorylation of IKK\u03b1\u2013IKK\u03b2 to suppress the classical NF-\u03baB pathway in carcinoma cells74.\n\nMembers of the Poxviridae, a large family of DNA viruses, modulate NF-\u03baB function through multiple proteins that target diverse NF-\u03baB signalling molecules, including the IKK complex75. Vaccinia virus (VACV), the prototypical orthopoxvirus, encodes a remarkable NF-\u03baB tool kit that includes multiple inhibitory proteins \u2014 such as A46R, A52R, B14, K1L M2L and N1L \u2014 all of which block activation of the IKK complex and inhibit degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1, albeit using diverse mechanisms76,77,78,79. Among these, B14 inhibits NF-\u03baB by directly targeting IKK\u03b2 of the IKK complex80. Interestingly, the B14 counterpart in the attenuated virus modified virus Ankara (MVA), encoded by ORF183 and lacking six amino acids that are present in \u03b1-helix 6 of B14, cannot inhibit NF-\u03baB activation81; as a result, MVA infection activates NF-\u03baB, whereas VACV infection inhibits NF-\u03baB very quickly after activating it. The VACV proteins E3L, K1L and N1L use multiple targets, as they all block both NF-\u03baB and antiviral pathways82,83. Molluscum contagiosum virus (MOCV) protein MC159 is a vFLIP that inhibits FAS-mediated apoptosis and TNF-induced late activation of NF-\u03baB. However, transgenic expression of this protein in mice instead enhanced NF-\u03baB-mediated immune responses84,85. Another MOCV protein, MC160, inhibits NF-\u03baB activation using multiple mechanisms86. ORF024 of the parapoxviruses encodes a unique protein that modulates the NF-\u03baB induction pathway. In the absence of this gene, the virus replicates normally in primary OFTu cells, but induces higher expression of NF-\u03baB-regulated chemokines and other pro-inflammatory host genes than the wild-type virus87. The ORF024 protein expressed by itself decreased phosphorylation of IKK and the downstream activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway, suggesting that this viral protein targets upstream kinases that phosphorylate IKK.\n\n\nTargeting NF-\u03baB and its cellular inhibitors\n\n\nViruses can also regulate the function of NF-\u03baB complexes through proteins that either directly interact with the nuclear factors themselves or control the cellular regulators of these factors. This indirect regulation includes inhibition of I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation, of dimer complex formation among the NF-\u03baB members, of nuclear translocation or of binding to the targeted cellular gene promoters (Fig. 3). Some viruses encode homologues of cellular NF-\u03baB signalling molecules, and these homologues act as dominant negatives of the cellular proteins. For example, ASFV encodes a homologue of I\u03baB\u03b1, A238L, which interacts with cellular RELA and thus suppresses the activation of NF-\u03baB complexes88. Furthermore, virus-encoded proteases can cleave I\u03baB\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB subunits to render them non-functional. The human coxsackievirus B3 protease 3C cleaves I\u03baB\u03b1 to create an amino-terminal fragment that interacts with RELA and translocates with it to the nucleus, where the complex therefore remains inactive89. This blockade of NF-\u03baB activation induces apoptosis of infected cells. Another protease, amino-terminal protease (Npro) from classical swine fever virus, also interacts with I\u03baB\u03b1 and modulates NF-\u03baB function90.\n\nSome viral proteins block NF-\u03baB activation by preventing the degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1. For example, HIV-1 modulates I\u03baB\u03b1 function in order to maintain long-term infection. The Vpu protein of HIV-1 blocks proteasome-dependent degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 by binding to \u03b2TRCP in the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that is involved in the regulated degradation of I\u03baB\u03b191,92. Thus, HIV-1 induces apoptosis of infected T cells by reducing the expression of NF-\u03baB-dependent cellular anti-apoptotic factors such as BCL-XL and TRAF1. The rotaviral non-structural protein NSP1 induces proteasome-dependent degradation of \u03b2TRCP to stabilize I\u03baB\u03b1 and inhibit NF-\u03baB93. Another HIV-1 protein, Tat, also inhibits degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and nuclear translocation of RELA94. This modulation of immune responses by Tat at late stages may provide a favourable environment for both HIV-1 and other opportunistic microorganisms. However, at early stages of infection, Tat instead activates NF-\u03baB.\n\nSome virus-encoded proteases can cleave NF-\u03baB itself. For example, the poliovirus protease 3C cleaves RELA at the later stages of infection and thereby suppresses NF-\u03baB activation95. Other virus-encoded proteins instead regulate the nuclear translocation of RELA. The cowpox virus ankyrin repeat domain-containing host range protein CP77 directly targets RELA and blocks its translocation to the nucleus to inhibit NF-\u03baB96. Several other poxviral proteins suppress NF-\u03baB function by preventing the degradation of the precursor molecule p105 (Refs 75, 97, 98). Hantaan virus, a member of the Bunyaviridae, uses its nucleocapsid (N) protein to block the nuclear translocation of RELA by interacting with importin-\u03b1 proteins, which are nuclear transport proteins used by the NF-\u03baB proteins to translocate to the nucleus99. The E1A protein from human adenovirus 12 associates with RELA and prevents PKAc, the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A enzymes, from phosphorylating RELA at Ser276; this then downregulates transcription of the genes encoding major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules100. Similarly, E1A binds to p50 and prevents its phosphorylation at Ser337 by PKAc101.\n\n\nOther mechanisms of NF-\u03baB modulation\n\n\nHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV) modulates the NF-\u03baB pathway at every stage of the viral life cycle, either by activation or inhibition. NF-\u03baB is activated during the viral entry process, whereas HCMV successfully inhibits the NF-\u03baB pathway after the initial infection. HCMV immediate\u2013early protein IE86 inhibits binding of NF-\u03baB to the promoters of interferon-\u03b2 (IFN\u03b2), cytokines and chemokines in response to TNF stimulation or virus infection102. However, IE86 does not block the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB or directly interact with the subunits, suggesting that the protein might target host factors required for the transcriptional activity of NF-\u03baB. HCMV can also inhibit the activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway that is induced by TNF and IL-1\u03b2 at later times post-infection, by inhibiting IKK activation using a late viral gene product103,104. An HCMV-encoded homologue of human IL-10 also inhibits NF-\u03baB activation105. Like HCMV, reoviruses also modulate NF-\u03baB in a manner that promotes the viral life cycle in the infected host. For example, reovirus 3 strain Dearing activates NF-\u03baB to induce NF-\u03baB-dependent apoptosis106. However, another strain of reovirus 3 (strain Abney) inhibits NF-\u03baB at a later stage of infection to promote induction of apoptosis in HEK293 and primary cardiac myocytes. Infection of cells with this strain inhibits activation of NF-\u03baB by external stimuli, an effect that requires the T3 S1 gene segment, which is also responsible for regulating apoptosis107.\n\nFor many virus-encoded proteins (Tables 2,3), the cellular targets are still unknown. For example, the West Nile virus protein NS1 inhibits TLR3-mediated activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway by blocking nuclear translocation of RELA and IRF3 in order to suppress the production of IL-6 and IFN\u03b2108. KSHV-encoded miRNAs, which are expressed during viral latency and in Kaposi's sarcoma tumours, modulate cellular gene functions and are thought to play a part in the pathogenesis of KSHV-induced malignancies. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the deletion of 14 miRNA clusters from KSHV reduced virus-induced NF-\u03baB activation and enhanced lytic induction, as KSHV miRNAs activate NF-\u03baB and induce enhanced expression of RTA and major capsid protein109.\n\n\nModulation of NF-\u03baB by bacteria\n\n\nBacterial proteins that directly interact with the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway. Bacteria generally encode a larger repertoire of proteins than viruses, and many of these proteins are also predicted to have host modulatory functions110. Like viruses, bacteria modulate the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway by either activation or inhibition, according to the requirement for the life cycle of the individual pathogen111. Individual bacteria often encode and deploy multiple effector proteins for regulation of the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway. Recent studies suggest that functional redundancy exists among the effector proteins from a single strain of bacteria112. Table 4 lists some of the documented NF-\u03baB modulators from bacteria and other microbial pathogens. Although the known bacteria-derived effector molecules that modulate the NF-\u03baB pathway are not structurally related to the viral modulators, in many cases they target the same cellular signalling molecules (Figs 2,3). For example, viral and bacterial effector molecules target the same IKK complex, as well as I\u03baB\u03b1, to inhibit the NF-\u03baB pathway (Fig. 3). By contrast, structurally related bacterial effector molecules often have diverse cellular targets for the regulation of NF-\u03baB function.\n\nUnlike viruses, bacterial pathogens use secretion systems, which are multicomponent complexes that translocate virulence factors to the extracellular space or the cytosol of target eukaryotic cells. These secretion systems are grouped into seven classes (type I to type VII) according to their protein composition and their mechanism of function113. Together, these secretion systems transport hundreds of virulence factors and effector proteins, but only a few of these have been characterized in detail. The known effector proteins that modulate host innate immune responses associated with the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway are primarily delivered by the type III secretion system (T3SS), as found in Salmonella spp. and Yersinia spp., or by the type IV secretion system (T4SS), as found in Bartonella spp. Type III effector proteins from Yersinia spp., known as Yops, counteract multiple signalling pathways that are activated in the infected host cells114. For example, YopJ (also known as YopP in Yersinia enterocolitica) inhibits NF-\u03baB signalling to block the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, multiple mechanisms of action were described for YopJ, as it has several protein targets in the NF-\u03baB pathway. YopJ was identified as a cysteine protease that also has deubiquitylating and desumoylating activity; it removes polyubiquitin chains from I\u03baB\u03b1 and therefore inhibits proteasomal degradation of the protein115. YopJ can also remove ubiquitin chains from TRAF6 to inhibit TLR-mediated activation of NF-\u03baB signalling116. In addition, it acts as an acetyltransferase that acetylates serine and threonine residues in the activation loops of IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2, thereby blocking phosphorylation and activation of the IKK complex by upstream kinases117,118. Aeromonas salmonicida encodes AopP, a type III effector protein that is related to YopJ. Secretion of this effector prevents the nuclear translocation of RELA, but the direct host target of AopP is unknown. It does not inhibit the phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1, suggesting that AopP might prevent degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 using a similar mechanism to that used by YopJ119. Thus, YopJ (variants of which are encoded by multiple Gram-negative bacterial species) has acquired several mechanisms of inhibiting the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway.\n\nOwing to the importance of the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway in many crucial cellular processes, cells have developed multiple mechanisms to regulate the function of this pathway. One negative regulatory mechanism is deubiquitylation of signalling molecules that activate the IKK complex, by deubiquitylase enzymes such as CYLD and zinc finger protein A20 (also known as TNFAIP3) (Refs 120, 121). Several bacteria have co-opted this mechanism using virulence factors that deubiquitylate NF-\u03baB signalling molecules. The type III effector protein AvrA of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. PhoPc, a non-pathogenic strain, is a deubiquitylase that is closely related to YopJ and that inhibits the NF-\u03baB pathway by removing ubiquitin from I\u03baB\u03b1 and from \u03b2-catenin, a negative regulator of the pro-inflammatory NF-\u03baB pathway in epithelial cells122,123. Another S. Typhimurium type III effector protein, SseL (encoded in Salmonella pathogenicity island 2), also possesses a deubiquitylase activity that inhibits degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1124,125. S. Typhimurium lacking SseL causes increased NF-\u03baB activation in macrophages as a result of ubiquitin-mediated degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1.\n\nSeveral bacterial proteins can inhibit the degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 by targeting the cellular ubiquitin machinery. The Shigella flexneri T3SS effector OspG can modulate the host NF-\u03baB function by blocking the degradation of phosphorylated I\u03baB\u03b1, and thus blocking NF-\u03baB activation, in response to TNF stimulation in and S. flexneri infection of epithelial cells126. OspG is a serine/threonine kinase that binds to various ubiquitylated ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s), including UBCH5 (also known as UBE2D1), to prevent ubiquitylation of phosphorylated I\u03baB\u03b1126. NleH1 and NleH2 from Escherichia coli O157:H7 str. EDL9883, an enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) strain, have a high level of sequence similarity with OspG but have different targets from OspG. NleH1 and NleH2 lack the ability to block I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation, but instead interact with the human 40S ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3), a subunit of NF-\u03baB complexes that regulates NF-\u03baB-dependent transcription127. This suggests that the bacterial effectors that regulate the NF-\u03baB pathway have many different targets and substrates. The existence of multiple NF-\u03baB inhibitors was observed in EHEC serogroup 0111, which encodes a homologue of OspG. Surprisingly, EHEC serogroup 0111 lacking OspG inhibited RELA transfer to the nucleus in response to TNF, suggesting that additional modulators from T3SS are present in this EHEC serogroup128.\n\nEnteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) can either activate or suppress NF-\u03baB through T3SS-dependent translocation of effectors and T3SS-independent mechanisms, presumably by activation of TLRs129. The T3SS effector proteins NleE and NleB can inhibit NF-\u03baB activation by inhibiting I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation130; NleE and NleB block the phosphorylation and activation of IKK\u03b2 by targeting upstream molecules, such as TAK1 (Ref. 130). Furthermore, NleE can block nuclear translocation of c-REL, but not of p50 or the transcription factors STAT1 and STAT2, indicating that the block in nuclear translocation is specific for c-REL (Ref. 131). OspZ, the NleE homologue from S. flexneri 6 and Shigella boydii, also blocks nuclear translocation of RELA in response to TNF-mediated activation of NF-\u03baB. Another S. flexneri effector protein, IpaH9.8, possesses E3 ligase activity and inhibits the NF-\u03baB pathway through a unique mechanism: it interacts with the IKK regulatory subunit NEMO and with ABIN1 (also known as TNIP1), a ubiquitin-binding adaptor protein, to promote the ABIN1-dependent polyubiquitylation of NEMO. Subsequent degradation of NEMO inhibits the activation of NF-\u03baB and thus downregulates the host inflammatory responses132.\n\nE. coli K1 suppresses the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines from infected monocytes. However, in the absence of OmpA, the bacterium activates the NF-\u03baB pathway via the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1; also known as MAPK3)\u2013ERK2 (also known as MAPK1) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 (also known as MAPK14) pathways, resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines133. Therefore, OmpA may target a kinase common to these pathways133. Opportunistic pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa synthesize a small molecule called N-(3-oxo-dodecanoyl) homoserine lactone (also known as C12), which inhibits the regulation of NF-\u03baB functions in activated mammalian cells134. Modulation of IKK and inhibition of NF-\u03baB signalling by C12 attenuates TLR4-dependent innate immune responses to promote persistent infection.\n\nLike their viral counterpart proteins, bacterial effectors can inhibit the function of NF-\u03baB transcription factors through direct interaction or proteolysis. Vibrio parahaemolyticus secretes the T3SS1-dependent effector protein VopS (encoded by the locus VP1686) into the cytosol of macrophages, and this then induces DNA fragmentation. VopS directly interacts with RELA to inhibit the DNA-binding activity of NF-\u03baB, causing apoptosis of the infected macrophages135. The intracellular bacterial pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis, which infects human eyes and the urogenital tract, has acquired multiple mechanisms to modulate NF-\u03baB function136. The C. trachomatis protein encoded by the locus CT441 (a Tsp-like protease) inhibits the nuclear translocation and function of NF-\u03baB by cleaving RELA, and also inhibits NF-\u03baB by regulating ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation137. Chlamydia deubiquitylase and deneddylase (ChlaDub1) binds I\u03baB\u03b1 and blocks its ubiquitylation and degradation, allowing C. trachomatis to evade the NF-\u03baB-mediated host inflammatory response138. Chlamydia pneumoniae, which lacks ChlaDub1, uses an inclusion-specific protein (encoded by the locus CP0236) to sequester NF-\u03baB activator (ACT1; also known as CIKS) and, thus, regulate NF-\u03baB139.\n\n\nOther bacterial proteins that affect NF-\u03baB\n\n\nBacterial effector proteins can also activate the NF-\u03baB pathway as a strategy of immune modulation (Fig. 2). Legionella pneumophila, which infects lung macrophages and causes Legionnaire's disease, activates NF-\u03baB signalling in a T4SS-dependent manner. Using an NF-\u03baB-specific luciferase reporter activation assay, LegK1 was identified as a potential activator of NF-\u03baB signalling. LegK1, a eukaryotic-like serine/threonine kinase, potently and specifically activates host NF-\u03baB signalling by directly phosphorylating I\u03baB\u03b1 and other members of the I\u03baB family of inhibitors, as well as p100 (Ref. 140). Thus, LegK1 bypasses the requirement for host IKKs and upstream kinases, such as TRAF2, TRAF6, TAK1, NIK and MEKK3, in the activation of both classical and alternative NF-\u03baB pathways. Rickettsia rickettsii, an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen, activates IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 to drive NF-\u03baB activation in human endothelial cells141. Bordetella pertussis produces filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA), a cell-associated secreted adhesin that can induce early activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway and cause the secretion of NF-\u03baB-regulated inflammatory cytokines; however, longer exposure to this adhesin inhibits NF-\u03baB activation, suggesting that there are complex temporal dynamics involved in the regulation of the innate response pathways142.\n\nLike viruses, bacterial pathogens modulate host signalling to maintain a delicate balance between the cell death and survival pathways. For example, although infection of non-myeloid cells by S. flexneri induces inflammatory responses and activates anti-apoptotic pathways through the rapid activation of the NOD1-dependent RIP2\u2013IKK\u03b2\u2013NF-\u03baB signalling pathway, the bacterium can also induce apoptotic and necrotic cell death143. Thus, a balance between the induction of the apoptotic and anti-apoptotic pathways dictates the fate of the infected cell.\n\nThe intestinal microbiota of mammals and other metazoans maintain a homeostatic balance with the host immune system. Recent studies suggest that NF-\u03baB signalling plays a crucial part in maintaining this host\u2013bacteria symbiosis144. The host has adapted several mechanisms to distinguish between commensals and foreign pathogens, and exercises a delicate balance between tolerance and immunity. For example, in the intestine the expression pattern and localization of PRRs and the activation of NF-\u03baB pathways have an important role in maintaining homeostasis144. Some commensal bacteria produce proteins that suppress immune activation; for example, Lactobacillus reuteri, a beneficial organism that is exploited for probiotics, can downregulate NF-\u03baB-dependent host proteins that mediate cell proliferation and survival145. This species blocks nuclear translocation of RELA by preventing the degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 in response to TNF stimulation145, although, as shown by a recent study using the commensal intestinal bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum, changes in host cell gene expression can depend on the bacterial growth phase146. On the other hand, the effects of probiotics in the prevention or treatment of diarrhoea caused by infection with enteric pathogens (for example, Saccharomyces boulardii) are thought to be mediated by immune modulation and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that are regulated by NF-\u03baB147. This suggests that the commensals could compete with invading pathogens and enhance host defences.\n\nBacteria can also exploit indirect mechanisms to shut off the NF-\u03baB-dependent host inflammatory responses. Bordetella spp. exploit the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 to suppress the host immune system. The Bordetella bronchiseptica T3SS effector BopN translocates to the nucleus of the host cell, where it induces the production of IL-10 and downregulates MAPKs. In addition, BopN blocks nuclear translocation of RELA but promotes nuclear translocation of p50 to selectively activate IL-10 expression148. This supports previous observations that B. bronchiseptica uses its T3SS to suppress NF-\u03baB in order to inhibit the induction of innate immune genes such as \u03b2-defensins149. The virulence factor LcrV of Yersinia spp. also enhances the production of IL-10 via an association with TLR6 (Ref. 150).\n\nSimilarly to viruses and bacteria, parasites have acquired diverse mechanisms to modulate the host innate immune responses controlled by NF-\u03baB. For example, the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii increases the level of phosphorylated I\u03baB\u03b1 in the infected host through the parasite kinase IKK to activate NF-\u03baB and thereby prolong the survival of host cells151,152.\n\n\nConcluding remarks\n\n\nNF-\u03baB plays a vital part in the early stages of the host response against diverse pathogens; thus, during the course of evolution microbial pathogens have collectively acquired an impressive repertoire of molecules that target almost every aspect of the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway. These pathogen-derived countermeasures have been selected to maintain a delicate balance between the activation and inhibition of the NF-\u03baB pathway as a survival strategy, and this supervening control has to be exercised throughout the time that the pathogen lives within the host. In fact, single pathogens frequently deploy multiple strategies to modulate the NF-\u03baB circuitry, but it is still a mystery why individual pathogens often need to express so many seemingly redundant regulators of the same pathway (for example, VACV encodes six known distinct NF-\u03baB regulators, and that number is still growing). It is also clear that diverse microbial pathogens have evolved, in parallel, the ability to manipulate common cellular targets to modulate the NF-\u03baB pathway. In fact, the pathogen-derived effector molecules themselves are remarkably diverse. With the continuing identification of ever more cellular mechanisms that regulate NF-\u03baB, it would not be surprising if at least some successful pathogens were shown to subvert these newly found regulatory mechanisms for their benefit. Furthermore, the identification of new pathogen-derived molecules that target NF-\u03baB will undoubtedly increase our appreciation of the most effective ways to manipulate NF-\u03baB therapeutically in uninfected hosts.\n\nThe receptors that trigger NF-\u03baB are activated not only by pathogens but also by various molecules that are produced by the host, and the uncontrolled activation of NF-\u03baB is associated with multiple inflammatory diseases, progressing syndromes of autoimmunity, and human cancers. Although the cause-and-effect relationships of NF-\u03baB activation in cancerous tissues are not completely understood, aberrant activation of kinase pathways that feed into the IKK proteins can constitutively activate NF-\u03baB and contribute to the progression of various malignancies153. It is not accidental that the major chemical and physical carcinogens that have been implicated in the promotion of cancer can also frequently activate NF-\u03baB. Newer drugs that inhibit NF-\u03baB by targeting upstream kinases in the pathway, and the IKK proteins, have shown promise as anticancer therapeutics in preclinical studies. However, it is worth remembering that successful pathogens are still Mother Nature's master drug chemists, and pathogen-derived molecules themselves (or derivatives of these molecules), such as bioactive peptides, may be developed as both anticancer and anti-inflammatory therapeutics in the future. Newer generations of drugs are needed to treat those immune diseases and cancers that depend on NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory support. Indeed, the 'right' druggable cellular targets have probably already been identified and targeted for exploitation by nature's successful microbial pathogens."}
