They may also provide information about the health of their animals in response to the directed questions listed in Chapter 3. Although a human health care provider should not attempt to offer advice about veterinary treatment (see Chapter 2), there are fundamental steps that he or she can take that may enhance the opportunities for early detection and prevention of human disease. In the case of the release of biological or chemical agents, either intentional or accidental, it is possible that sudden animal mortality or morbidity clusters could be an early warning sentinel event that would need to be recognized and acted on as soon as possible to reduce human health risks (see Chapter 13). The following section provides an overview of common clinical signs in animals, potential etiological agents, clinical and public health implications, and the next steps that human and animal health care providers should take if they learn of such conditions.\n\nIn general, the human health consequences of a particular animal illness fall into two main categories ( Figure 41 ). The first category is direct infection risk. The clinical sign is related to an infectious agent that could pass from the animal to the person, with the animal serving as a source for the zoonotic infection risk. An example may be the direct infection of a person tending a calf with cryptosporidial diarrhea after fecal material splashes directly into the person's mouth. The second is as an environmental sentinel event. The clinical signs of the animal disease provide an indication of an environmental hazard, either infectious or toxic, to which human beings may also be exposed. For example, identification of Rocky Mountain spotted fever in dogs has led to the discovery and treatment of disease in a human patient. 1 Similarly, a dog that becomes ill after ingesting toxic berries on an ornamental plant signals a potential danger for children who could inadvertently ingest the berries. Elevated blood lead levels in pets are an indicator of lead exposure risk in children living nearby. Table 41 includes selected animal disease conditions for which a heightened index of suspicion for human disease risk is warranted, potential etiological agents and public health implications, and next steps for the human health care provider in protecting public health. A diagnosis in the animal should be pursued and human case findings similarly investigated while considering a common source of exposure.\n\nhuman DiSeaSe SymPtomS that may be relevant for animal health Just as animals can serve as sentinels of human health risk, it is conceivable that disease symptoms in the owner of an animal being treated or in human beings in the community could have important ramifications for veterinarians and animal health. It is possible that clients will spontaneously volunteer information about a medical condition they or household members are experiencing, and they may provide information in response to the directed questions listed in Chapter 3. Veterinarians should not provide medical advice or otherwise attempt to diagnose disease in a person based on reported signs, but reports of certain symptom complexes in human beings should trigger steps, such as advising the client to contact a human health care provider for follow up, as well as possibly affect the type of animal health care required.\n\ntypes of human Disease Symptoms that may be important to veterinarians Table 42 includes human diseases for which a veterinarian may take appropriate action. The relevance to animal health professionals of a particular disease or symptom in human beings can be classified into several categories:\n\n\u2022 Zoonotic disease acquired from an animal. This may necessitate referral of a person to a health care provider, evaluation of suspect animal(s), and a review of hygienic and biosafety practices and other preventive measures. Immunocompromised persons (e.g., from chemotherapy, chronic debilitation) are at increased risk of severe complications from a zoonotic disease, and there is consequently a need for increased vigilance to prevent zoonotic transmission from a petrelated infection such as diagnosing and treating any animal infections and reviewing infection hygienic practices. \u2022 Reverse zoonoses (disease passing from the human to the animal). This could require screening the animal for infection as well as ensuring that the human being receives appropriate treatment and review of infection control practices and prevention measures. \u2022 Potential environmental sentinel event. Signaling a risk of biological, chemical, or physical hazards in the environment to which animals or other people may also be exposed and *These actions should also include recommending that patients consult their veterinarians. BSE, Bovine spongiform encephalopathy; SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome. "}
