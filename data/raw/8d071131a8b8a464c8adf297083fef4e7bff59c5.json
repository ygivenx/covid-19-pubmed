{"title": "", "body": "The multiplication of RNA vi-C H APT ER 6 ruses differs from that of the DNA viruses we have just considered in several important re-The Multiplication Of spects. Unique among genetic RNA Viruses systems, their genome is RNA, which is transcribed, trans-I lated, and replicated quite differently from DNA; indeed, the RNA viruses themselves vary widely in the mechanisms whereby these processes are accomplished. Compared with most DNA viruses, all are extremely limited in the amount of genetic information they carry (see Table 7 -1), hence they code for relatively few enzymes, although all require at least one RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Finally, most RNA viruses mature by budding from cytoplasmic membranes.\n\nThe basic features of the viral multiplication cycle have already been described (Chapter 5). Before embarking upon a systematic description of the multiplication of RNA viruses we shall summarize those steps in the cycle in which RNA viruses differ fundamentally from DNA viruses.\n\nBaltimore (1971b) has done a great deal to clarify the thinking of virologists on the various ways in which transcription, translation, and replication of RNA genomes occurs in RNA viruses of different genera (Table 6 -1). It will be noted that the RNA extracted from a virus is infectious only if (a) the genome does not occur in pieces, and (b) there is no virion transcriptase. The latter is a reflection of the polarity of the viral RNA. A transcriptase is only necessary when the viral RNA is \"antimessage,\" so that a complementary mRNA must be transcribed. The reverse transcriptase of Leukovirus constitutes a special case.\n\nTo simplify discussion it is first necessary to explain the terminology we shall use for describing different species of virus-related RNA. Throughout this book we use the term cRNA to mean RNA complementary to RNA in the virion (vRNA), regardless of the polarity of the vRNA. In other words, the 221 mRNA of picornaviruses is identical with vRNA (one may call it \"vmRNA\"), whereas the mRNA of rhabdoviruses is cRNA (or \"cmRNA\"). Hopefully, this terminology should lead to less confusion than either of the two alternatives that the reader may encounter in the literature: namely (a) the conventional practice of calling virion RNA \" + \" and its complement \"-,\" or (b) Baltimore's more recent idea of calling mRNA \" + \" and its complement \"-.\" Both ideas are logical, but the existence of two mutually contradictory schemes suggests that we should use neither; the terminology proposed describes unequivocally the nature of the RNA under discussion. The alternative mechanisms whereby the genetic information encoded in vRNA can be translated into protein (Table 6 -1) can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. The single-stranded viral RNA (vRNA) molecule of picornaviruses and togaviruses can be viewed as a giant messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule containing meaningful genetic information (\"sense\") directly translatable by ribosomes into protein. The huge polypeptide that results is subsequently enzymatically cleaved into progressively shorter polypeptides.\n\n2. The single-stranded RNA molecule of the paramyxoviruses and rhabdoviruses, on the other hand, is \"antimessage\"; RNA of complementary nucleotide sequence (cRNA) must first be transcribed and only this is seen by tRNA's and ribosomes as mRNA that can be translated into proteins. A virus-coded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (\"transcriptase\"), carried in the helical ribonucleoprotein (RNP) nucleocapsid in these genera transcribes cRNA while still in situ in intracellular ribonucleoprotein. Some at least of these transcripts are full length; it is not certain whether or not any are shorter. However, whether by direct transcription or by cleavage of full length cRNA, short lengths of \"monocistronic\" cRNA arise, each of which has poly A added to its 3' end, and is separately translated into a separate polypeptide.\n\n3. The seven (or more) separate single-stranded RNA molecules of the orthomyxoviruses are also \"antimessage.\" A separate cRNA molecule, representing a monocistronic mRNA molecule, is transcribed from each one by a virion-associated transcriptase.\n\nsharply with the paramyxoviruses and picornaviruses which multiply quite normally in the presence of actinomycin D or even in enucleated cells.\n\nThere are more genera of RNA viruses than of DNA viruses. Little is known of the multiplication process in some; these will be dealt with in summary fashion. A great deal of work has been carried out with model viruses of other genera; descriptions of their multiplication will be correspondingly detailed. 100 . Latent periods, multiplication rates, and final yields are all affected hy species and strain of virus and hy cell strain and the kind of culture; latent period and multiplication rate, hut not final yield, hy multiplicity of infection.\n\nThe basic multiplication cycle of different RNA viruses varies substantially in both the length of the latent period and the viral yield. Figure 6-1 illustrates representative examples of the multiplication curves of model viruses of the best studied genera.\n\nPoliovirus type 1, the type species of the genus Enterovirus, which is the type genus of the family Picornaviridae, has for many years served as the model for the detailed biochemical analysis of the multiplication of RNA viruses. As already pointed out, the mechanism of translation of the genome of Picornaviridae is by no means common among RNA viruses; but data on the replication of poliovirus RNA have wider applicability. In this section, we shall present the current state of knowledge about poliovirus multiplication in considerable detail in the hope that it will serve as a solid foundation upon which the discussion of less thoroughly explored genera may be built as the chapter develops. Relatively little will be said of other picornaviruses apart from occasional reference to pioneering work with the cardioviruses, ME, EMC, and mengovirus.\n\nSeveral excellent reviews provide valuable guides to the earlier literature (Baltimore, 1969 (Baltimore, , 1971a Baltimore et al, 1971; Bishop and Levintow, 1971; Cooper, 1969; Summers et ah, 1971 ).\n\nPoliovirus multiplies rapidly and to high yield in many human and simian cell lines, in monolayer or suspension cultures. The whole growth cycle is confined to the cytoplasm (Franklin and Baltimore, 1962) where viral RNA replication, protein synthesis, and virion assembly all occur in close association with membranes (Mosser et al., 1972) . Actinomycin D has no inhibitory effect (Reich et ah, 1962) , nor indeed does enucleation of the cell (Crocker et al., 1964) . Viral RNA can be separated from cellular RNA by taking the cytoplasmic material labeled in a short pulse of radioactive uridine in the presence of actinomycin, purifying it by chromatography or rate zonal centrifugation, and assaying it by infectivity. Viral proteins can be preferentially labeled with amino acids after host mRNA transcribed before the addition of actinomycin has been given time to decay in the presence of guanidine, a reversible inhibitor of viral multiplication (Summers et al., 1965) . Recently cell-free systems have been employed to provide further insights into the expression of the viral genome (Rekosh, 1972) .\n\nHuman picornaviruses multiply only in human or simian cells because only the latter carry the specific receptors to which these viruses adsorb (reviews by Holland and Hoyer, 1962; Holland, 1964) . The receptor substance has been isolated, but not purified, from plasma membranes of susceptible cells and shown to contain protein closely associated with membrane lipid. Cells from human amnion, which are refractory to poliovirus infection in vivo, were found to lack the specific receptors on initial explantation in vitro, but such receptors appeared after a period in culture (Holland, 1961; Chany et al., 1966) . Similarly, M. Taylor et al. (1971) have presented evidence that a bovine enterovirus selectively destroys certain malignant tumors of mice in vivo because the cancer cells bear receptors that are not exposed in other mouse tissues. The receptors for various enteroviruses appear to differ from one another as judged by crosssaturation experiments, differential susceptibility to blocking by anticellular sera and to proteases, and differences in regeneration time at 37 \u00b0C (see Levitt and Crowell, 1967) .\n\n\"Nonsusceptible\" mammalian cells may be infected with purified enteroviral nucleic acid; though the \"plating efficiency\" of the RNA is extremely low, the progeny consist of perfectly normal infectious virions (Holland, 1964) . The device of cell fusion by inactivated Sendai virus has also been used as a means of introducing polio virus into cells lacking the specific receptor; normal multiplication of virus follows (Enders et al., 1967) .\n\n\"Uncoating\" of picornaviruses commences while the adsorbed virion is still outside the cell. Joklik and Darnell (1961) showed that about one-half of the polio virions that had attached to cells at 4\u00b0C subsequently eluted into the supernatant medium when the temperature was raised to 37\u00b0C; eluted virions were found to have suffered a distortion of the capsid which rendered them unstable to high salt concentration and no longer capable of readsorption to susceptible cells. Mandel (1971a) analyzed the effects of this temperature-dependent process on the conformational state of the capsid; the physical properties of the virion are greatly changed, and it no longer binds neutralizing antibody efficiently. Crowell and Philipson (1971) demonstrated that eluted coxsackievirus B3 virions, which were noninfectious by virtue of being unable to reattach to HeLa cells, had specifically lost the polypeptide VP4; it seems probable, therefore, that VP4 is the first protein to be released in the uncoating process. This may suffice to weaken the capsid sufficiently to ensure its automatic dissolution on entering the cytoplasm.\n\nHall and Rueckert (1971) have demonstrated that the extracellular uncoating process proceeds even further with the cardioviruses. At 37\u00b0C more than one-half the adsorbed ME virions liberate their RNA into the supernatant fluid; the capsid remains temporarily attached to the plasma membrane then dissociates into 14 S pentamers. Extracellular uncoating occurred only at 37 \u00b0C and could be inhibited by alkaline pH (8.5) or hypertonic salt (40 mM MgCk), conditions that have previously been found to stabilize ME virions against heat inactivation, to increase phagocytosis (Dales, 1965a), and to increase the plating efficiency of isolated viral RNA (review, Pagano, 1970). Obviously, release of RNA into the surrounding medium is not in itself relevant to the establishment of successful infection in nature, but the disruption of the capsid which makes RNA release possible is probably the first step in uncoating of the virion.\n\nPrecisely how the virion traverses the plasma membrane is not clear. Dales et al. (1965a) presented evidence for cytosis, but Dunnebacke et al. (1969) propose that adsorbed virus can \"penetrate directly\" into the cytoplasm. It is also not clear whether the removal of VP4 and/or the extrusion of RNA normally occurs before the virion enters the cytoplasm (Chan and Black, 1970) or after association with the membrane of a phagocytic vacuole (Mandel, 1967a, b,c).\n\nOnce uncoated, the infecting viral RNA molecule attaches by its 5' end to a 45 S ribosomal subunit and protein synthesis soon begins. No preliminary tran-scription of cRNA is necessary because the vRNA itself constitutes mRNA suitable for direct translation into protein. Formal proof of this fact has gradually accumulated over the years. Poliovirus-infected cells were found to contain unusually large polyribosomes with 20 to 40 (average 35) ribosomes distributed along the length of an mRNA of molecular weight and base composition indistinguishable from vRNA (Penman et ah, 1963 (Penman et ah, , 1964 . Such polysomes synthesized proteins which were immunologically precipitable with poliovirusspecific antisera (Scharff et ah, 1963; Warner et al., 1963) . Ultimate proof has come with the demonstration that vRNA serves as a template for the in vitro synthesis of proteins with peptide maps resembling those of infected cells and including those of purified virions (Rekosh et al., 1970) .\n\nThere are no punctuation points in the poliovirus RNA molecule. In this respect, it differs from the polycistronic messengers represented by certain bacterial virus RNA's. Ribosomes attaching to the 5' end progress down the whole length of the molecule until they encounter the sequence of fifty adenines near the 3' end. Hence a giant polypeptide with a molecular weight of 250,000 daltons is synthesized, corresponding to the whole poliovirus genome. Very rapidly, however, this \"polyprotein\" (Baltimore, 1971a) is cleaved by proteolytic enzymes in a systematic fashion.\n\nPosttranslational cleavage was demonstrated by \"pulse labeling\" virusinfected cells with radioactive amino acids for a very brief period, then \"chasing\" with an excess of unlabeled amino acids to reveal quantitative movement of counts from large proteins into smaller and progressively smaller ones (Summers and Maizel, 1968; Holland and Kiehn, 1968; Jacobson and Baltimore, 1968b) . Formal confirmation that the small proteins did indeed represent cleavage products of the short-lived high molecular weight precursors came with the demonstration that peptide maps of precursor and products could be equated (Jacobson et al., 1970) . Recognition of the very large polypeptide corresponding to the whole poliovirus genome was not a simple matter because of its very short life. Jacobson and Baltimore (1968b) demonstrated its existence by allowing protein synthesis to proceed in the presence of amino acid analogs, or at a temperature of 43 \u00b0C, or in the presence of diisopropyl fluorophosphate to inhibit cleavage (reviews by Baltimore, 1971a; Baltimore et ah, 1971) . Kiehn and Holland (1970) , using another enterovirus, coxsackievirus Bl, reported that the high molecular weight protein was readily detected early in the multiplication cycle, before large quantities of the cleavage enzyme(s), which they believed to be virus-induced, had accumulated in the cell. Then Roumiantzeff et ah (1971) found that much of the protein synthesized in vitro by membrane-associated polyribosomes extracted from poliovirus-infected HeLa cells was uncleaved.\n\nThere may be some ambiguity in the choice of cleavage loci by the putative proteolytic enzyme(s) (Cooper et ah, 1970b) . Usually, however, the precursor polypeptide is cleaved at specific sites and in a definite order to yield functional proteins that are now well characterized (reviews, Baltimore, 1971a; Baltimore et ah, 1971 ). Figure 7 -2 (Chapter 7) depicts the sequence of events. NCVP00 represents the \"polyprotein\" translated from the whole polioviral genome. While nascent on the ribosome it is cleaved in two places to yield NCVPl, NCVP2, and NCVPX (Jacobson and Baltimore, 1970) . There is good evidence from genetic maps constructed from recombination experiments using temperaturesensitive mutants that NCVP2 is (or includes) the viral polymerase I, and more tentative speculation that NCVPX may represent polymerase II, or perhaps a sigma factor conferring viral specificity on a host polymerase (Cooper, 1969; Cooper et al., 1971) . NCVPl clearly contains all the structural polypeptides of the viral capsid, for the second round of cleavage (which may sometimes occur before NCVP00 has been completed but is usually delayed for some minutes) converts it to VPO, VPl, and VP3, which comigrate in gel electrophoresis with the three structural proteins found in empty virions, and have almost identical tryptic peptide maps (Baltimore, 1971a). As will be discussed in detail below, the final cleavage of VPO to yield VP2 and VP4 does not occur until 20-30 minutes later, coinciding in time with the assembly of RNA and protein into mature virions.\n\nCell-free systems have recently been developed to facilitate the detailed examination of protein synthesis (reviews by Lucas-Lenard and Lipmann, 1971; Phillips and Sydiskis, 1971) . Several years ago, Warner et al. (1963) were able to demonstrate that poliovirus RNA could serve as a template for the in vitro translation by \u00a3. coli ribosomes of protein precipitable by antisera raised against poliovirions. Recently, Rekosh et al. (1970) have shown by peptide mapping that poliovirus RNA is translated as efficiently as f2 RNA by E. coli ribosomes, but the resulting proteins are much smaller than NCVP00. Initiation occurs at several sites in this bacterial in vitro system, each of the resulting proteins beginning with N-formyl methionine. This being so, such systems lose much of their appeal as an approach to the study of translation of animal viral RNA's. Fortunately, however, satisfactory mammalian cell-free systems are now being developed. As first demonstrated some years ago, EMC viral RNA is translated efficiently in vitro by Krebs' ascites ribosomes from the mouse (see Kerr and Martin, 1971) . Ribosomes from rabbit reticulocytes were then shown to translate enteroviral RNA with fidelity to yield specific protein of high molecular weight (Mathews and K\u00f6rner, 1970) . Human HeLa cell ribosomes translate RNA from any of the cardioviruses almost as well as do ribosomes of murine origin (ascites or L cells) provided that certain soluble factors are supplied from mouse cells (Eggen and Shatkin, 1972) .\n\nThe vagaries of mammalian cell-free protein-synthesizing systems are now sufficiently well understood and controlled for them to begin to be extensively used to examine the fine controls of the translation process, as well as the mechanism of action of interferon, virus-induced repressors of cellular protein synthesis, and \"late\" viral proteins that suppress the expression of \"early\" viral genes.\n\nAs soon as the infecting RNA molecule has been translated, a polymerase molecule becomes available to transcribe cRNA (-) from the vRNA (+) template. Kinetic studies show that RNA replication commences within V2 hour of infection and proceeds at an exponential rate until 10-20% of the final yield of RNA has been made by 3.5 hours, after which synthesis continues at a linear rate of about 2500 molecules per minute until a total of 250,000 molecules have been synthesized (Darnell et al. r 1967) . Fully one-half of these eventually become encapsidated in virions-quite an efficient process. It takes less than 1 minute for a viral RNA molecule to be transcribed (100 nucleotides per second) but the doubling time of vRNA during the linear phase is about 15 minutes, indicating that chance factors and probably regulatory mechanisms we know little about determine whether new vRNA molecules are utilized for transcription, translation, or encapsidation.\n\nFrom the outset of studies on the multiplication of RNA viruses, it was recognized that at least one novel enzyme must be involved: a polymerase capable of catalyzing the transcription of RNA from an RNA (rather than a DNA) template. It was assumed that no preexisting cellular enzyme would suffice and this intuitive assumption was confirmed by the demonstration that many RNA viruses could multiply normally in the presence of actinomycin D, which blocks transcription by DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Reich et al., 1962) . Virus-induced RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (\"RNA synthetase\" or \"replicase\") was soon discovered in mengo-and poliovirus-infected cells (Baltimore and Franklin, 1963b) . Crude extracts of cytoplasm stimulated poliovirus RNA synthesis in vitro, though the enzyme was somewhat unstable. Actinomycin D had no inhibitory effect on its synthesis or on its activity. Similar replicases have since been discovered for a wide range of RNA viruses but each tends to be specific for its own particular RNA, implying that viral RNA possesses near its 3' end a specific nucleotide sequence that serves as a recognition and binding site for its own polymerase.\n\nThe precise mechanism of replication of viral RNA was debated heatedly during the 1960's but has now been clarified, largely as a result of definitive studies with bacterial viruses of the f2 group (reviews, Weissmann et al., 1968; Spiegelman et al., 1968) . In synopsis, vRNA (+) is the template for the synthesis of cRNA (-). Several cRNA molecules may be transcribed simultaneously by separate polymerase molecules; the whole structure is known as the \"replicative intermediate\" (RI) . Released cRNA molecules in turn serve as templates for the simultaneous transcription of several vRNA strands. Different polymerases may be required for the two stages in this cyclic process. A doublehelical form of viral RNA, known as the \"replicative form\" (RF), is an irrelevant end product or artifact. A schematic diagram of the replication of viral RNA is given in Fig. 6 -2.\n\nPoliovirus RI, first described by Baltimore and Girard (1966) and positively identified by Baltimore (1968b) and Bishop et al. (1969) , possesses all the properties to be expected of the structure described by Weissmann et al. (1968) and Spiegelman et al. (1968) . Table 6 -2 lists these properties and compares the RI with single-stranded vRNA and with the double-stranded RF first described by Montagnier and Sanders (1963) .\n\nThe RI (reviews, Bishop and Levintow, 1971; Montagnier, 1968) can be separated from mRNA, cRNA, and RF by such techniques as agarose gel filtration or benzoylated DEAE-cellulose chromatography. It consists of a single\n\ncomplete strand (usually -, sometimes +) on which about six or seven complementary strands (+ or -) are growing simultaneously. Transcription begins at the 3' end of the template. Each progeny strand is hydrogen bonded to its template over only a short sequence of base pairs at its growing end. The polymerase molecule present at this growing end may play an important role in holding the strands together. The 5' end of each nascent strand quickly separates from the template and floats free as a single-stranded \"tail/' These tails can be artificially removed from the RI by ribonuclease I, leaving a partially doublestranded structure consisting of one intact strand hydrogen bonded to several shorter sequences, with gaps in between. Heating the RI produces a biphasic hyperchromic shift; the single-stranded branches are gradually denaturated at relatively low temperatures, then hydrogen bonds are melted abruptly when the T m of the double-stranded RF is reached. On analysis, most of the complete single-stranded templates are found to be cRNA (i.e., -, as indicated by their ability to hybridize with vRNA) while the short pieces of heterogenous lengths are found to be mainly.+. In other words, the synthesis of RNA is asymmetric, + strands being made at five to ten times the rate of -strands (Bishop and Levintow, 1971).\n\nIt is not known whether some control mechanism is involved or whether the preponderance of cRNA templates in RI is the inevitable consequence of the fact that mRNA is siphoned off for translation and encapsidation. It is also not known whether separate polymerases are required for the transcription of + from -, and -from +, respectively, or whether a single enzyme performs both functions, as occurs with Q\u00df phage (Mills et al., 1966) . Cooper et ai. (1970a, 1971 ) have presented genetic evidence for the existence of two enzymes: poly- Soluble merase I, coded by the 3' end of the genome, is considered to be the enzyme catalyzing the transcription of -from + ; polymerase II, possibly coded by the short middle section of the genome, NCVPX, is postulated to transcribe -f-from -templates. RI accumulates at an exponential rate during the first few hours of infection (Baltimore and Girard, 1966) . The best evidence that the RI does represent the real intermediate in the replication of viral RNA comes from \"pulse chase\" experiments in which radioactivity rapidly entered RI then passed into singlestranded progeny molecules (Girard, 1969; McDonnell and Levintow, 1970) .\n\nRF with typical double helical structure accumulates in moderate amounts only late in infection (Baltimore and Girard, 1966) and is an irrelevant end product of viral RNA replication (Baltimore, 1968b; Girard, 1969) . Furthermore, there is good evidence that much of the double-stranded material isolated from infected cells is an artifact resulting from the fact that single complementary strands anneal spontaneously in vitro following extraction (Weissman et al., 1968) . Oberg and Philipson (1971) were able to abolish the annealing artifact by adding diethylpyrocarbonate prior to phenol extraction of the RNA. Their work finally disposed of the suggestion that poliovirus RNA replication occurs by a conservative mechanism, i.e., by the transcription of single strands from a double-stranded template. The process is clearly semiconservative.\n\nThe viral capsid is composed of 60 NCVPl molecules. Though each is cleaved enzymatically within 10 minutes to VPO, VPl and VP3 (Summers and Maizel, 1968) , all three cleavage products remain permanently associated by noncovalent bonds as a 5 S (100,000 molecular weight) \"immature protomer\" (Rueckert, 1971 ; see Chapter 3). Pulse-chase experiments demonstrate that these monomers polymerize in less than 5 minutes in vivo to form 14 S pentamers (Phillips et al, 1968; Hall and Rueckert, 1971 ; see Fig. 6 -3). Twelve such pen-\u0392 __^\u0393\u03c1\u039d\u0391(\u03bd\u03a1\u0399 \u03b9 2,3,4) 6 0 1+\u0393(\u03bd\u03a10,\u0399,3) 5 1, tamers may aggregate to form 74 S empty capsids in vivo (Maizel et al, 1967) or in vitro (Phillips et al, 1968; Phillips, 1971) . Jacobson and Baltimore (1968a) presented evidence that these \"procapsids\" are essential precursors in virion assembly. They maintain that at the time VPO is cleaved to yield VP2 and VP4 (20-60 minutes after its synthesis) a viral RNA molecule enters the procapsid to form the complete virion. It is easier to envisage that RNA is able to associate with capsomers to form a virion only after the \"immature protomers\" have assumed a particular tertiary configuration as a result of cleavage of VPO -> VP2 + VP4. \"Procapsids\" would then represent experimental artifacts or unstable byproducts of viral assembly.\n\nThe kinetics of virion assembly are presumably determined by the local concentration of the reactants in the vicinity of cytoplasmic membranes. Since assembly can occur spontaneously in vitro it appears that no special \"maturation mechanism of action of interferon, virus-induced repressors of cellular protein protein\" is required, apart from the proteolytic enzyme that cleaves VPO into VP2 and VP4 immediately beforehand. As a result of the diversion of mRNA from transcription to translation which occurs from 3.5 hours onward, there is a substantial pool of capsid protein but not of vRNA. Hence virions are assembled at an exponential rate from RNA synthesized 0-15 minutes earlier and protein made an average of 20 to 60 minutes earlier. A single HeLa cell produces 150,000 poliovirions (Baltimore, 1969) . These are readily visualized by electron micros-copy, free in the cytoplasm, or occasionally as crystalline aggregate (Dales et ah, 1965a) .\n\nEvery newly synthesized vRNA molecule is confronted with a triple choice: (a) to serve as a template for transcription of cRNA (replication), (b) to serve as a template for translation of protein, or (c) to associate with capsid proteins and form a virion. We know little about the factors that govern this choice, but they may well be dictated by considerations of topology.\n\nA few examples will suffice to illustrate the problem. It was unexpected to find that polymerase I, which is presumably the first virus-coded protein required for the replication of the parental RNA molecule, is in fact synthesized last of all the viral proteins, being situated at the C terminal end of NCVPOO. However, there may be great advantage in the polymerase molecule being completed in close apposition to the 3' end of the vRNA because that is the end to which the polymerase must bind to initiate the first round of RNA replication. Until at least one complementary RNA molecule has been transcribed by this replicase the exponential phase of viral multiplication cannot begin. Indeed, there must be only a small probability that the enzyme can successfully complete its 1-minute journey from 3' terminus to 5' without encountering a ribosome progressing slowly (12 minutes) in the opposite direction. Failure to accomplish this mission before the template is degraded by RNase could lead to an abortive infection, and is perhaps one of several reasons for the low \"plating efficiency\" of viruses in mammalian cells (see Chapter 2). The chance delays encountered by the infecting vRNA molecule in transcribing the first molecule of cRNA, or indeed in managing to attach to a 45 S ribosomal subunit to translate the first polymerase molecule, may contribute substantially to the well known phenomenon of \"multiplicity-dependent delay\" (Cairns, 1957) .\n\nThe function of the long sequence of adenine residues (poly A) situated near the 3' end of poliovirus RNA and of other vmRNA's (Armstrong et ah, 1972) , is unknown, but it may be involved in regulation.\n\nIt is probably significant that the quite separate processes of transcription and translation both occur in close association with membranes. A striking proliferation of cytoplasmic vesicles (smooth membrane cisternae) is clearly visible by electron microscopy between 3 and 7 hours after infection (Amako and Dales, 1967; Mosser et ah, 1972) . By rate zonal and equilibrium gradient centrifiguration, it is possible to separate the sites of viral RNA replication from those of protein synthesis (Caliguiri and Tamm, 1970) . RNA is synthesized in a \"replication complex\" (Penman et ah, 1964; Girard et al., 1967) consisting of RI with about one-half dozen molecules of attached polymerase in association with smooth membrane. Viral proteins, on the other hand, are assembled mainly but not exclusively on membrane-bound polyribosomes, which can be clearly separated from RI and polymerase. It seems, therefore, that ribosomes do not attach to the 5' end of nascent mRNA while it is still being transcribed from a cRNA molecule, as happens in certain bacteria. Nevertheless, the fact that RNA engaged in transcription or translation must be attached to a membrane ensures that ribosomal subunits will find themselves in close apposition to mRNA molecules as the latter detach from the RI. In-fact, Huang and Baltimore (1970a) have calculated that the average newly synthesized mRNA molecule has thirty-five ribosomes attached to it in little more than 10 minutes, i.e., the minimum time required for one ribosome to travel the length of the message. Similarly, localization of these processes to a restricted area on the surface of a membrane may enable capsid proteins to accumulate in sufficient concentration to stand a good chance of encountering a vRNA molecule and assembling automatically into a virion.\n\nOnce viral RNA replication is well underway and new vRNA templates are accumulating exponentially, some regulatory mechanism must operate to ensure that most of the vRNA molecules are deployed as templates for protein synthesis. That this is indeed so is apparent from the striking preponderance of mRNA over cRNA in the infected cell. Cooper et al. (1973) have pointed out that, since each virion contains 60 NCVPl molecules for every molecule of vRNA, an efficient multiplication program would demand that the overall rate of viral protein synthesis exceed that of vRNA by a factor of 60. Yet six to seven molecules of cRNA are simultaneously transcribed from vRNA in less than 1 minute, while each of thirty-five ribosomes using a similar template simultaneously manufacture only thirty-five molecules of NCVPl in 11 to 12 minutes. Cooper et al. (1973) postulate the existence of a regulatory protein, the \"equestron,\" corresponding to the partially cleaved capsid protein precursor (VPO, 1, 3) and present an ingenious scheme to explain how this protein could control viral transcription, translation, and assembly.\n\nPoliovirus and other picornaviruses produce substantial inhibition of host cell RNA, protein, and DNA synthesis. These specific effects which begin quite early in the viral multiplication cycle are not to be confused with the later decline of cellular and viral macromolecular synthesis that eventually accompanies the death of the cell in any cytocidal infection. Virus-induced cell \"shutdown\" (\"shutoff,\" \"cutoff\") has been recognized for many years (Martin et al., 1961; Franklin and Baltimore, 1962; Zimmerman et al., 1963) but there is still uncertainty about the precise mechanisms involved (reviews, Darnell et al., 1967; Martin and Kerr, 1968) . Direct comparison of results obtained in different systems is difficult because the speed and extent of the shutdown depends critically on the multiplicity of infection and the medium (\"growth\" or \"maintenance\") as well as on the strain of virus and cell involved. Early data that cellular protein synthesis declines at least as rapidly as cellular RNA, despite the fact that mammalian mRNA has a half-life of several hours, pointed to separate effects of viral infection on translation and transcription, respectively. The decline in cellular DNA synthesis is thought to be a secondary consequence of inhibition of host protein synthesis. Most of the available evidence suggests that newly synthesized virus-coded protein(s) are responsible for the shutdown of all these cellular macromolecules (Franklin and Baltimore, 1962; Penman and Summers, 1965) , although it is puzzling that interferon has no effect on the phenomenon (Martin and Kerr, 1968).\n\nWithin an hour of picornavirus infection polyribosomes begin to dissociate and most of the ribosomes are freed within 2 hours. Concomitantly with the rise in virus-coded protein synthesis, polyribosomes reappear, but now they are uniformly large (20-40 ribosomes, average 35) because vRNA, with a molecular weight of 2.6 million daltons, has supplanted cellular mRNA of heterogeneous but generally lower molecular weight (Penman et al., 1963; Dales et al, 1965a) . By the time substantial amounts of new viral protein become detectable the rate of cellular protein synthesis has dropped to 25 to 50% of normal, and it continues to fall further throughout the remainder of the cycle (Franklin and Baltimore, 1962). Experiments with cycloheximide indicate that a newly synthesized virus-coded protein is responsible for the shutdown (Baltimore and Franklin, 1963; Penman and Summers, 1965) ; it acts by preventing the attachment of cellular mRNA to ribosomes (Leibowitz and Penman, 1971) . If viral RNA replication is prevented by guanidine or by infection with virus inactivated by ultraviolet irradiation or hydroxylamine, shutdown of host protein synthesis is negligible at low multiplicity of infection but still occurs at high multiplicity, presumably because a certain amount of the repressor protein is synthesized, albeit at a very slow rate, off parental vRNA templates (Penman and Summers, 1965) . Cooper et al. (1973) postulate that the repressor is the \"equestron,\" namely, the viral capsid protein precursor NCVPl, at the stage when it has been cleaved to VPO, 1, and 3 but before its final cleavage to VPl, 2, 3, and 4. Ehrenfeld and Hunt (1971) have demonstrated that double-stranded RNA (RF) inhibits polioviral protein synthesis when added to an in vitro system of rabbit reticulocyte ribosomes. This phenomenon is not specific because synthetic polynucleotides as well as double-stranded RNA from Q\u00df and reovirus are also somewhat inhibitory.\n\nRelatively little new information on the mechanism of shutdown of cellular RNA synthesis has accumulated since the phenomenon was first described by Franklin and Baltimore (1962) . Viruscoded protein synthesis seems to be necessary for shutdown of cellular RNA transcription but the possibility has not been excluded that the phenomenon is secondary to the shutdown of host protein synthesis. If one of the viral polymerases is formed by the substitution of a virus-coded \u03c3 factor in a host-coded transcriptase, so changing its template specificity from cellular to viral nucleic acid, this could have the incidental effect of blocking the transcription of cellular RNA.\n\nInhibition of transcription of cellular mRNA might be expected to enhance the rate of viral protein synthesis by decreasing the competition for ribosomes as existing mRNA decays. However, mammalian mRNA has such a long halflife that the impact of shutdown of mRNA synthesis on the production of cell protein must be reckoned as insignificant in comparison with the more rapid direct effect of viral infection on translation. Moreover, the production of ribosomal RNA is inhibited at least as markedly as mRNA (Darnell et al, 1967) . It is questionable, therefore, whether virus-induced suppression of cellular RNA synthesis plays an important role.\n\nInhibition of Cellular DNA Synthesis. Cellular DNA replication is so absolutely dependent on RNA and protein synthesis that a decline in its production must inevitably follow a decline in the latter. Hand et al. (1971) have used autoradiography following a pulse of [ 3 H]thymidine to examine the reduction of cellular DNA synthesis during infection by mengovirus, as well as by Newcastle disease virus and reovirus. They found a diminution in the number of active sites at which DNA replication was initiated but no reduction in the rate of chain elongation, nor was there any destruction of existing DNA, as occurs with some bacteriophages.\n\nInhibition of Cell Division. Needless to say, virus-induced shutdown of host protein synthesis immediately blocks cell division, which is sensitive to inhibition of protein synthesis up to the moment that mitosis begins (Tobey et ah, 1965) . If, however, mitosis has already commenced before host protein synthesis is suppressed, cell division preempts viral multiplication for the duration of mitosis (about 1 hour) and the viral multiplication cycle is extended for a corresponding period; arresting cell division in metaphase with chemical inhibitors also blocks viral multiplication (Marcus and Robbins, 1963) .\n\nClearly, the irreversible shutdown of cellular protein, RNA, and DNA synthesis that follows the synthesis of viruscoded protein (Franklin and Baltimore, 1962) must inevitably kill the cell. However, cytopathic effects become visible within a few hours of infection; the fact that this CPE is prevented by guanidine led Bablanian et al. (1965) to conclude that newly synthesized viral coat protein may be the cause. Allison and Sanderlin (1963) postulated that virus-induced CPE results from the release of destructive enzymes from damaged lysosomes (review, Allison, 1967) . More recently, Blackman and Bubel (1969), using \u00df-glucuronidase as an index, demonstrated that lysosomal enzymes are liberated shortly before virus is released and proteins begin to leak from infected cells.\n\nAs originally described by von Magnus (1954) , serial transfer of influenza viruses at high multiplicity leads to the production of \"incomplete\" (noninfectious) virus in progressively greater amounts. A similar phenomenon is demonstrable with poliovirus although 16-18 consecutive passages at high multiplicity were necessary to produce a population of noninfectious (DI) particles (C. Cole et al., 1971) . These particles interfere with the multiplication of infectious virus but are only capable of reproduction themselves when complemented by infectious virions. In the absence of the \"helper,\" they are competent to make viral proteins and defective viral RNA but no infectious virions. Analysis of the RNA of the major class of DI particles indicated that 13-15% of the viral RNA was missing from the 5' end of the molecule, hence an abbreviated version of the capsid protein precursor (NCVPl) was made.\n\nRelatively little is known about the multiplication of human rhinoviruses, except that the polypeptides synthesized are very similar to those of poliovirus (Medappa et ah, 1971 ). However, FMDV has attracted considerable attention because of the threat it poses to the livestock of countries that seek to prevent its entry by quarantine (review, Bachrach, 1968) . Arlinghaus and Polatnick (1969) described two Mg 2+ -dependent, actinomycin-resistant, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activities which appeared to be compartmentalized in different regions of the cytoplasm of FMDV-infected BHK21 cells, one preferentially making single-stranded and the other double-stranded RNA. Cell protein synthesis is markedly depressed by FMDV infection and cell RNA slightly so. A temporary decline in the degree of methylation of tRNA has also been described (van de Woude et ah, 1970) .\n\nIt will be recalled that togaviruses are small enveloped icosahedra containing a single molecule of single-stranded RNA of molecular weight 4 million daltons and very few structural proteins : one (or sometimes two) in the \"core\" and two peplomer glycoproteins. The recent revival of interest in the multiplication of these viruses stems from the fact that their simple envelopes provide useful models for the study of membrane structure and glycoprotein synthesis.\n\nTogaviruses are potent inducers of interferon and are very sensitive to its action, and much of our basic knowledge of togavirus multiplication was obtained in the early 1960's as a byproduct of investigations on interferon. More recently, Pfefferkorn and B\u00fcrge (1968) have produced an extensive collection of ts mutants for complementation studies which have yielded useful information (see Chapter 7), while B\u00fcrge and Strauss (1970) have made pioneering contributions on the incorporation of viral glycoproteins into membranes. Apart from some early studies on Western equine encephalitis virus (WEE), most of the recent work has been done with two other alphaviruses, Sindbis and Semliki Forest virus (SFV) which behave almost identically in most respects. The account that follows will be based on these viruses; subsequently, the behavior of viruses of the genus Flavivirus and the ungrouped togavirus, rubella virus, will be briefly described.\n\nTogaviruses grow to high titer and are simply assayed by plaquing in cultured chick fibroblasts, BHK21, or Vero cells. The latent period is only 3 hours at high multiplicity with some alphaviruses but longer with the flaviviruses. Virions are produced by budding and reach maximum titers after 7 hours or more (M\u00e9cs et ah, 1967) . The synthesis of viral macromolecules can be readily followed because these viruses grow at a normal or enhanced rate in the presence of actinomycin D (Taylor, 1965) . The whole replication cycle is confined to the cytoplasm. Viral RNA is infectious (Wecker and Schonne, 1961) indicating that the genome is not divided and requires no accompanying transcriptase.\n\nThe mechanism of entry of togaviruses into cells has not been studied, but the speed of multiplication suggests that the viral RNA is uncoated rapidly and Stern and Friedman (1969) isolated a putative RI by chromatography on columns of benzoylated-DEAE cellulose; this heterogeneous RNA was partially RNase-resistant and was preferentially labeled in short radioactive pulses. More recently Simmons and Strauss (1972b) have described two species of RI, one producing complete vRNA molecules, the other producing shorter molecules of the same polarity. Treatment with RNase yielded three species of RF, corresponding in length to one-third, two-thirds, and 100% of the viral genome. Stollar et al. (1972) have isolated even shorter (12 S and 15 S) double-stranded RNA species late in the cycle from Sindbis virus-infected mammalian or avian (but not mosquito) cells. Sreevalsan (1970a) found that most of the RI, RF, and viral polymerase in Sindbis virus-infected cells was bound to cytoplasmic membranes. Parental vRNA from radioactively labeled virions also rapidly attached to membranes, leading Sreevalsan to the conclusion that intimate association with membranes is essential for viral RNA replication.\n\nMartin and Sonnabend (1967) described a cytoplasmic membrane-associated polymerase appearing 2-3 hours after SFV infection, which was capable of catalyzing the in vitro synthesis of double-but not single-stranded viral RNA from endogenous intracellular substrate. They took this to be the transcriptase and postulated the existence of a second enzyme, the replicase. Pfefferkorn and B\u00fcrge (1968) obtained evidence for two polymerase cistrons on the basis of complementation between their ts mutants of groups A and B (see Table 7 -6). The preparations of Sreevalsan and Yin (1969) may have contained the replicase as well as the transcriptase since they synthesized single-stranded vRNA as well as RI and RF in vitro.\n\nElectron microscopic studies (Morgan et al., 1961; Acheson and Tamm, 1967; Tan, 1970; Matsumura et al., 1971 ) have clearly demonstrated that alphaviruses acquire an envelope in the process of budding from cytoplasmic membranes (see Plate 3-14). The first step in assembly is the association of vRNA with protein to form the nucleocapsid (Friedman, 1968) . Nucleocapsids then migrate to the plasma membrane and budding occurs at a relatively constant rate of 200-1000 pfu per hour from those regions of the membrane into which viral peplomers have been inserted (Acheson and Tamm, 1967) . Relatively few virions form by budding into cytoplasmic vacuoles; aggregation of excess nucleocapsids around such vesicles and into paracrystalline arrays (Morgan et ah, 1961) occurs only very late in the cycle when the release of virions into the supernatant fluid is almost complete (Acheson and Tamm, 1967) . The extensive proliferation of cytoplasmic vacuoles that is also seen in thin sections may be connected with some necessary role for membranes in viral RNA replication and protein synthesis rather than with the budding process, because the phenomenon is equally conspicuous in poliovirus-infected cells.\n\nWaite and Pfefferkorn (1970) discovered that budding can be completely arrested by reducing the ionic strength of the surrounding medium. On reversal of the block, virus that has accumulated intracellularly is suddenly released in a synchronous burst.\n\nTogaviruses inflict little obvious damage on cultured invertebrate cells (see Weiss, 1971 ) but produce a moderate degree of CPE in vertebrate cell cultures. It is not surprising to find therefore that they cause a moderate suppression of host macromolecular synthesis in the latter but not the former.\n\nIn both Sindbis virus-and SFV-infected vertebrate cells, a decline in host protein synthesis is detectable by 3 hours and develops progressively until over 90% of the protein and glycoprotein being made toward the end of the cycle is viral (Friedman, 1968; Strauss et ah, 1969; B\u00fcrge and Strauss, 1970) . Cellular RNA synthesis does not slow significantly until quite late in the cycle (Taylor, 1965) .\n\nFlaviviruses multiply much more slowly than alphaviruses (Stollar et ah, 1967) , and tend to bud into cytoplasmic vacuoles rather than from the plasma membrane (Filshie and Reh\u00e2\u00e7ek, 1968), but in most other respects follow a similar pattern. For example, with dengue type 2 virus, the best studied member of the genus, RNA synthesis becomes detectable about 6 hours after infection and the three major RNA species formed sediment at much the same rate as their alphavirus counterparts (Stollar et ah, 1967) . Electron microscopy reveals a striking increase in the number of cytoplasmic vacuoles; nucleocapsids bud mainly into these vesicles (Matsumura et ah, 1971) . Crystalline aggregates of virions accumulate inside the vacuoles late in infection of Vero cells, but this is not a prominent feature in BHK21 or KB cells, despite higher yields in the latter. The latent period was 12 hours in all three cell lines. Increasing the Mg 2+ concentration in the medium led to a sudden stimulation of release.\n\nTrent et ah (1969) studied RNA synthesis by St. Louis encephalitis virus and found three major species : vRNA (43 S), RF (20 S), and an RNase-resistant 26 S material thought to be the RI. Westerway and Reedman (1969) presented tenta-tive evidence that the proteins of Kunjin virus might be derived by posttranslational cleavage.\n\nHolmes et ah (1969) were the first to show that rubella virus closely resembles the prototype togaviruses in its morphogenesis. Sedwick and Sokol (1970) found essentially the same species of RNA in rubella virus-infected BHK21 cells as have been reported for other togaviruses: a 38 S single-stranded vRNA (which is infectious), a 20 S double-stranded RF, and a partially RNase-resistant RI. The proteins of the rubella virion resemble those of other togaviruses in number and molecular weight but their intracellular synthesis has yet to be studied.\n\nArboviruses, by definition, multiply in both arthropods and vertebrates, despite the very considerable differences between the two in metabolism, including of course body temperature. The independent establishment of continuous lines of mosquito cells by Grace, Singh and Peleg presents virologists with the opportunity to compare the growth of togaviruses in invertebrate and vertebrate cells (reviewed by Weiss, 1971; Dalgarno and Kelly, 1973) . Reh\u00e2\u00e7ek et al (1971) and Buckley (1971) have shown that several flaviviruses and some alphaviruses grow well in mosquito cell lines. There are usually no cytopathic effects, although some flaviviruses lyse a few cells or cause others to fuse together, but the culture eventually recovers. Persistent infections usually develop with only a small proportion of the cells producing virus. SFV grows with essentially the same kinetics (latent period, rate of viral production, final yield) in cultured cells of the mosquito Aedes albopictus at 28\u00b0 or 37\u00b0C as it does in vertebrate cells (Vero) at 37\u00b0C (Dalgarno and Kelly, 1973) .\n\nThe influenza viruses differ in several important respects from the viruses we have been discussing so far. The genome occurs as 7 or more separate RNA molecules, each corresponding to a single cistron. A transcriptase associated with the ribonucleoprotein transcribes cRNA molecules which serve as messengers for translation into the seven known viral proteins. Mixed infection commonly leads to reassortment of the separate influenza genes giving rise to hybrid particles (see Chapter 7). Repeated passage of a single strain of virus at high multiplicity leads to the production of noninfectious particles lacking the largest of the genes (\"incomplete virus\" and the von Magnus phenomenon, discussed below). The multiplication of influenza virus is inhibited by actinomycin D, a-amanitine, enucleation of the host cell, or preirradiation of the cell with ultraviolet light; the meaning of these observations is uncertain, but one interpretation is that transcription of some cellular DNA is essential for viral replication.\n\nVarious aspects of influenza virus multiplication have been reviewed by Hoyle (1968) , Robinson and Duesberg (1968) , Scholtissek et al {1969), Blair and Duesberg (1970) , Kingsbury (1970 ), Pons (1970 , Compans and Choppin (1971), Shatkin (1971) , and White (\u038a973).\n\nUntil the 1950's much of what was known of the multiplication of animal viruses came from studies of influenza virus in the embryonated egg (reviews, Burnet, 1960; Hirst, 1965) . The failure until recently to find cell lines that supported influenza virus multiplication delayed the application of modern biochemical methods, but some useful studies have been made with fowl plague virus in chick cells (Scholtissek et al, 1969) and other influenza virus strains in MDBK cells (Choppin, 1969) . The latent period is 3-4 hours for influenza type A and somewhat longer for type B. Release by budding continues for many hours. Hemagglutination (Hirst, 1941) and hemadsorption (Shelokov et al, 1958) have proved useful shortcuts in monitoring the progress of infection.\n\nThe discovery and detailed description of the specific attachment of influenza virus to host cells via a glycoprotein-glycoprotein interaction was one of the pioneering achievements of the early days of animal virology (reviews, Hirst, 1965; Scholtissek et al, 1969) . Following his discovery of hemagglutination in 1941, Hirst demonstrated that cells infectible by influenza virus also carried a receptor for the viral hemagglutinin and could be rendered resistant to infection by destroying those receptors with neuraminidase. Body fluids including respiratory mucus and serum were found to contain an inhibitor of hemagglutination and of infectivity, which competed with cellular receptors for virus but, like the cell receptors, could be destroyed by viral or bacterial neuraminidase. Gottschalk (review, Gottschalk et al, 1972) identified the cellular receptors and the soluble inhibitors as glycoproteins with N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid) as the terminal sugar in the carbohydrate sidechains and demonstrated the removal of neuraminic acid with neuraminidase (sialidase).\n\nThere was a widespread belief that the viral neuraminidase must play a role in the initiation of infection, but Fazekas de St Groth (1948a) disproved this notion, and proposed that the host cell actively engulfed the influenza virion by a process he called \"viropexis.\" Dales (review, Dales, 1965a) has supported this hypothesis; others (Hoyle et al, 1962; Due-Nguyen et al, 1966; Morgan and Rose, 1968) have postulated that the envelope of the influenza virion, and by implication that of other enveloped viruses, fuses with the plasma membrane of the cell, liberating the nucleocapsid directly into the cytoplasm (Plate 6-1). Morgan and Rose (1968) demonstrated that fusion occurs very rapidly at 37\u00b0C (within about 5 minutes of adsorption at 4\u00b0C); they agree that phagocytosis (viropexis) does occur but believe that the phagocytosed virions are mostly destroyed by lysosomal enzymes. The matter is still unresolved; it is probable that virus enters in both ways, and possible that both are relevant.\n\nFollowing penetration, but before the actinomycin D-sensitive step, there is a delay, the duration of which varies for each infecting virion strictly according to chance (White et ah, 1965) . The mean delay at a multiplicity of infection of < 1 is 2.5 hours but can be reduced to zero at high multiplicity. This fact provides the rationale for using high multiplicity inocula to synchronize infection.\n\nComplementary RNA begins to be transcribed as early as 15 minutes after infection and remains the dominant species of virus-specific RNA until vRNA takes over during the third hour (Scholtissek and Rott, 1970) . Doubtless, the virion transcriptase is responsible for the early cRNA synthesis, and the enzyme may be active before the RNA is freed from the proteins of the core. The virion transcriptase (Chow and Simpson, 1971; Penhoet et ah, 1971; Skehel, 1971 ) is known to be present in the ribonucleoprotein itself (D. Bishop et ah, 1972; Cornpans and Caliguiri, 1973) ; NP40-treated cores actively produce abbreviated strands of cRNA in vitro (Bishop et ah, 1971; Chow and Simpson, 1971; Skehel, 1971 ). An RNA-dependent RNA polymerase with the same properties (production of short lengths of cRNA in vitro, requirement for Mg 2 + and stimulation by Mn 2 + , actinomycin-insensitivity) is synthesized in influenza-infected cells (Ho and Walters, 1966; Scholtissek, 1969) . The concentration of this transcriptase builds up slowly from 1 hour after infection to reach a peak in the cytoplasm late in the cycle (Scholtissek and Rott, 1970) . The cRNA almost certainly represents mRNA since it is found in association with polyribosomes (Pons, 1972) . Final proof of whether each molecule represents a monocistronic message will have to await the in vitro synthesis of individual viral proteins from purified populations of each cRNA species.\n\nThe viral structural proteins (see Table 3 -6) are synthesized on cytoplasmic polyribosomes but rapidly migrate to other parts of the cell, the NP accumulating in the nucleus and the HA in cytoplasmic smooth membranes (White et ah, 1970) . Protein M also moves into smooth membranes (Lazarowitz et ah, 1971; Compans, 1973) .\n\nThe main nonstructural protein, NS, accumulates in the nucleolus within 5 minutes of its synthesis in the cytoplasm (Taylor et ah, 1969 (Taylor et ah, , 1970 Lazarowitz et ah, 1971) , and is also found in association with ribosomes (Pons, 1972; Compans, 1972) . It is possible that the two events are related since ribosomes are assembled in the nucleolus; NS may direct ribosomes to translate viral rather than cellular mRNA. Alternatively this protein, which is the most plentiful virus-induced macromolecule, may represent a subunit of a viral RNA polymerase (Taylor et ah, 1970) . NS almost certainly represents the basic polypeptide subunit of the type-specific nonstructural protein previously recognized in the nucleolus by immunofluorescence (Dimmock, 1969) . Recently, Skehel (1972) has reported a second nonstructural polypeptide (molecular weight 11,000 daltons) on gel electrophorograms of infected cells.\n\nThe influenza virus-infected cell is a good system for studying the factors that influence the movement of proteins within the cell. The transport of polypeptides NS and NP into the nucleus does not require continuing RNA or protein synthesis; the entry of HA into membranes is an energy-requiring process (White et al., 1970) . Indeed, HA is always associated with membranes, being synthesized on membrane-associated ribosomes and moving within minutes through the smooth endoplasmic reticulum into plasma membrane (Compans, 1973; Stanley et al., 1973) . Using various inhibitory sugars which have been shown to block the completion of viral glycoproteins without affecting the synthesis of other viral proteins (Gandhi et al., 1972) , it has been shown that glucosamine is added to the HA almost immediately the polypeptide is synthesized and fucose is added shortly after (Stanley et al., 1973) .\n\nThe HA glycoprotein is sometimes cleaved enzymatically into two smaller glycoproteins, HAi and HA2, which nevertheless remain associated by disulfide bonds (Lazarowitz et al., 1971; Stanley and Haslam, 1971) . Posttranslational cleavage may be fortuitous rather than essential because it occurs to different degrees with different virus-cell combinations and some systems yield infectious, hemagglutinating virions in which the HA is totally uncleaved (Stanley et al., 1973) . Brief pulse labeling followed by prolonged chases have shown that all the other major virus-coded proteins are completely stable and not products of posttranslational cleavage of any high molecular weight precursor (Taylor et al., 1969) .\n\nFrom the third hour of infection onward, over 80% of the RNA synthesized in the presence of actinomycin D is vRNA (Duesberg and Robinson, 1967; Nayak and Baluda, 1968; Scholtissek and Rott, 1970) . Clearly, some kind of regulatory mechanism must encourage the preferential synthesis of vRNA at the expense of cRNA, even though the latter is required for both translation and replication. Pons (1970) has postulated that the individual RNA molecules may remain linked during replication, perhaps held in sequence along a backbone of NP, but evidence for this is lacking. Nayak and Baluda (1968) described a structure that appeared to represent the replicative intermediate: a rapidly labeled 14 S RNA, partially RNase-resistant, and precipitable by 2 M NaCl. The replicase has not yet been identified, nor is it known whether PLATE 6-1.\n\nreplication (or transcription for that matter) occurs in the nucleus or the cytoplasm.\n\nAssembly of influenza virions coincides with their release from the cell by budding (Due-Nguyen et al., 1966) . The process has been examined in detail by Compans and Dimmock (1969) . Areas of plasma membrane containing hemagglutinin and neuraminidase develop visible projections about the same time as a new layer of protein (presumably M) is laid down on the inside of the membrane. Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) associates with these areas of morphologically altered membrane and spherical or filamentous virions bud off. The process will be discussed in greater detail in the section on paramyxoviruses, but two points are of particular interest here: the state of the RNP and the role of neuraminidase.\n\nRNP isolated from infected cells occurs in short lengths corresponding to the particular class of RNA molecule each contains (Duesberg, 1969; Kingsbury and Webster, 1969; Pons et al., 1969) . Structurally it resembles that isolated directly from virions (see Chapter 3; Fig. 3-6) , viz., a double helix with a single-stranded loop at one end. Compans et al. (1970a) have calculated that the probability of the correct combination of five (now considered to be seven or more) RNP pieces being selected at random from the intracellular pool for incorporation into a budding virion is unrealistically low unless one assumes that the average virion contains an excess of such pieces. On the other hand, it is still possible that the natural state of RNP in infected cells and virions is a single continuous strand incorporating a complete set of RNA molecules and that the RNP fragments described are the result of breakage at weak points between the individual RNA's (Pons, 1970) .\n\nNeuraminidase moves into localized regions of the plasma membrane, often starting near one pole of cells spread out in monolayer, at about the same time as hemagglutinin (Maeno and Kilbourne, 1970) . No doubt the enzyme is responsible for the absence of neuraminic acid in the glycoproteins and glycolipids of such areas of membrane (Klenk et al., 1970b ). Yet it seems improbable that neuraminidase plays a vital role in the insertion of glycoproteins into membranes, peplomer formation or budding itself, because many budding viruses lack the enzyme altogether. However, neuraminidase may play a role in expediting the elution of budded virions from the outside of the cell (Comp\u00e0ns et ah, 1970a) because anti-neuraminidase IgG (but not the monovalent Fab fragments obtained by pepsin digestion) inhibits the release of virus (Becht et al., 1971) . Anti-hemagglutinin has no effect, but concanavalin A, which appears to bind more strongly to neuraminidase than to hemagglutinin, does block viral production (Rott et al, 1972) .\n\nThe viral structural proteins are not made in anything like equimolar numbers, or even in the same proportion as they occur in the virion itself (White et ah, 1970) . In particular, some regulatory mechanism must suppress the expression of the genes for NA and P proteins which are barely detectable in the infected cell, whereas NP and NS are made in very large amounts. The synthesis of these two proteins becomes detectable during the second hour after infection and rises to a plateau between 5 and 8 hours. More recently, Skehel (1972) has shown that the relative rates of synthesis of viral proteins change with time; early in the cycle NS is abundant and M scarce, whereas the converse applies later.\n\nCellular protein synthesis is substantially shut down with some virus-cell combinations, beginning at about 2 hours after infection when viral proteins start to be made in quantity and becoming almost total late in the cycle (White et ah, 1970; Skehel, 1972) . In other systems, shutdown is minimal until quite late (Lazarowitz et ah, 1971) . A newly synthesized viral protein appears to be responsible (Long and Burke, 1970) . Since cellular RNA synthesis is not suppressed by influenza virus infection (Scholtissek et ah, 1969) but if anything is stimulated during the first 3 hours (Mahy et ah, 1972) , the repressor protein probably acts at the level of translation; it may well be NS.\n\nInfluenza virus differs from most other RNA viruses in that its replication is inhibited by actinomycin D ( Barry et al., 1962) . If the drug is added during the first 2 hours after infection the synthesis of viral RNA, protein, and transcriptase are all blocked; if added later there is little overall inhibition of viral yield but cRNA synthesis continues to be affected, despite the fact that transcriptase synthesis is no longer blocked and actinomycin has no effect on the transcription of cRNA in vitro (Barry, 1964; White et al, 1965; Scholtissek and Rott, 1970) .\n\nPreirradiation of the host cells with ultraviolet light also inhibits influenza virus multiplication (Barry, 1964) . Large doses have no effect on the capacity of cells to support the multiplication of parainfluenza virus added subsequently, but the capacity of preirradiated cells to support the growth of influenza virus is just as sensitive as is the virus-cell complex itself shortly after infection (White and Cheyne, 1966) . Moreover, parainfluenza virus will grow in enucleated fragments of cytoplasm whereas influenza virus will not (Cheyne and White, 1969) . All this tends to support the hypothesis, first put forward by Barry (1964) that influenza requires the expression of some cellular gene(s) early in the multiplication cycle.\n\nRecently, it has been shown that the drug, \u03b1-amanitine, which inhibits cellular DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II (see Chapter 4) also blocks the production of influenza but not parainfluenza virus, with much the same time characteristics as actinomycin (Rott and Scholtissek, 1970) . The drug does not inhibit the virion transcriptase in vitro (Penhoet et ah, 1971 ) and has no effect on the synthesis of total RNA if added to infected cells later than 2 hours after infection (Mahy et ah, 1972) . However, Mahy and his colleagues found that a-amanitine inhibits the early burst of RNA synthesis detected in influenza-infected cells during the second hour. Since this RNA is transcribed at a time when they can demonstrate an increase in activity of a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (?II) they believe it to be cellular RNA.\n\nRott and Scholtissek, however, do not accept that any of the data need be interpreted in terms of a nuclear requirement in influenza multiplication. They have postulated that the action of the various inhibitory drugs and of UV irradiation might be to liberate or activate a cellular RNase that destroys influenza RNA in the nucleus or to block viral RNA transport (Scholtissek et al, 1969; Scholtissek and Rott, 1970) . On the other hand, Dimmock (1969) has proposed that the inhibitory effects of actinomycin and UV irradiation are due to the considerable changes in the nucleoli that are morphologically apparent following treatment of normal cells with these agents. In influenza virus infection, the nucleoli are also grossly distorted (Compans and Dimmock, 1969), a nonstructural antigen is serologically demonstrable there (Dimmock, 1969) , and the main nonstructural protein, NS, rapidly accumulates there from the second hour of infection onward (Taylor et ah, 1970; Lazarowitz et ah, 1971 ).\n\nIn 1946, von Magnus described a phenomenon which now bears his name (review, von Magnus, 1954) . Repeated passage of influenza virus at high multiplicity led to progressive increase in the proportion of noninfectious virus particles among the progeny. These \"incomplete\" particles represent the prototype of what are now more generally known as DI (defective interfering) particles, produced under comparable circumstances with a wide range of viruses (Huang and Baltimore, 1970b). Incomplete influenza particles are deficient in the largest class of RNA molecule (Duesberg, 1968a; Pons and Hirst, 1969; Choppin and Pons, 1970) and in transcriptase (Chow and Simpson, 1971 ). It has been postulated that the smaller RNA molecules compete more successfully for the viral replicase (Blair and Duesberg, 1970; Huang and Baltimore, 1970b; Choppin and Pons, 1970) and it is quite possible that the largest RNA molecule(s) codes for a polymerase component.\n\nIn general, it is true to say that passage of influenza at high multiplicity will encourage the production of incomplete virus, but there are some interesting exceptions. Influenza A0/ strain WSN grown in MDBK cells does not produce any substantial number of noninfectious particles when passaged at high or low multiplicity in MDBK, or even in HeLa cells in which the multiplication cycle is usually abortive (Choppin, 1969) ; this can be viewed as an example of \"hostcontrolled modification\" (see Chapter 7). Choppin and Pons (1970) consider that the various virus-cell systems can be arranged in a sequence of decreasing productivity; at the top end would be highly productive systems such as any viral strain in MDBK cells, where the progeny are fully infectious even at high multiplicity for the first 1-2 passages; in the middle would be the classic von Magnus situation, applicable to most virus-cell combinations, where DI particle production increases only with repeated passage at high multiplicity; at the bottom end of the scale are \"nonpermissive\" cell lines, such as HeLa, in which the cycle is abortive (nonproductive) even at low multiplicty.\n\nThe most important differences between the multiplication of orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses are based on the fact that the genome of the former is segmented and that the latter is not. It will be recalled that the paramyxovirus RNA occurs as a single strand of molecular weight 6.5-7.5 million daltons enclosed in a tubular nucleocapsid that also carries a transcriptase. Shorter molecules of cRNA transcribed by this enzyme serve as mRNA (reviews, Blair and Duesberg, 1970; Kingsbury, 1970) . Paramyxovirus multiplication, unlike that of orthomyxoviruses, is resistant to actinomycin D or preirradiation of the cell with ultraviolet light (Barry et al., 1962) and can occur in enucleated cells (Cheyne and White, 1969) . Most paramyxoviruses carry in their envelope not only a hemagglutinin and neuraminidase like the orthomyxoviruses, but also a hemolysin and a factor that causes cells to fuse into multinucleate syncytia (Okada, 1962) .\n\nParamyxoviruses grow more slowly than influenza virus, do not usually shut down host macromolecular synthesis to any substantial extent, and commonly set up persistent infections in cultured cells. They have served as the main models for the study of carrier cultures (see Chapter 12) and of the phenomena of budding (review, Choppin et al., 1971) and cell fusion (see Chapter 9). More general aspects of paramyxovirus multiplication have been reviewed by Robinson and Duesberg (1968) and Compans and Choppin (1971) . Most of the recent biochemical investigations have been conducted on Newcastle disease virus (NDV), Sendai (a strain of parainfluenza virus type 1), and simian virus type 5 (SV5), also known as parainfluenza virus type 5, hence the discussion that follows will be confined to an integrated synopsis of the findings obtained with these three viruses.\n\nThough the adsorption of paramyxoviruses to susceptible cells has not been studied in great detail, the presence of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase in the viral envelope make it a reasonable assumption that the process is basically the same as for the orthomyxoviruses. As with other enveloped viruses, controversy surrounds the mechanisms of penetration and uncoating. Compans et al. (1966) presented electron micrographs showing examples of cytosis of SV5 (Plate 6-2) whereas Durand et al. (1970) have claimed that NDV nucleoprotein is released following fusion of the viral envelope with isolated chick cell membranes.\n\nHomma (1971) has described an interesting example of host-controlled modification of a paramyxovirus that is relevant to the understanding of penetration. Sendai virus undergoes only a single cycle of multiplication in L cells, the progeny being noninfectious for L cells (but not for eggs) and having a greatly\n\nThe data indicate that trypsin removes a protein from the surface of L cell-grown Sendai virus which otherwise hinders the apposition of viral envelope with plasma membrane. It would be consistent with the hypothesis that paramyxoviruses enter cells by membrane fusion aided by the hemolysin, which may correspond with the lysolecithin of the viral envelope (Barbanti-Brodano et al., 1971) or with lipidbound peplomers (Hosaka and Shimizu, 1972) .\n\nAnother isolated finding of some interest is that Sendai virus multiplication is blocked by the drug ouabain, which is known to inhibit the plasma membrane enzyme Na,K-ATPase, leading to an inability of the cell to maintain a high intracellular K + concentration (Nagai et ah, 1972) . , 1970 ). It appears, therefore, that paramyxovirus mRNA consists of cRNA molecules which are shorter than the vRNA template (50-57 S) from which they are transcribed. Following transcription, polyadenylie acid totaling 4 S is covalently attached to 18 S cRNA (Pridgen and Kingsbury, 1972). Transcription of Sendai virus cRNA from parental vRNA templates occurs even in the presence of cycloheximide (Robinson, 1971b) presumably because the viral transcriptase is carried into the cell as an integral constituent of the nucleocapsid (Huang et al., 1971; Robinson, 1971a; Stone et al., 1971) . Later in the cycle, cycloheximide again has no effect on the synthesis of cRNA, which is still the dominant RNA species being made, but the synthesis of vRNA (57 S) declines rapidly (Robinson, 1971b).\n\nIt is a rapidly labeled RNA with some base-pairing and some single-stranded tails, as evidenced by partial RNase-resistance and precipitation by 1 M NaCl, which sediments heterogeneously (28-60 S), and on melting yields a mixture of single-stranded 50 and 18 S RNA. Identification of the 50 S material as vRNA and the 18 S as cRNA by hybridization of the latter to RNA extracted from virions has to be interpreted in the face of the finding that a substantial minority of the 50-57 S RNA found in purified NDV or Sendai virions is complementary to the majority (\"vRNA\") species (Robinson, 1970) .\n\nPresumably some TI's must synthesize full length (50-57 S) cRNA molecules in order that they, in turn, may serve as templates for the production of more vRNA. The outstanding remaining question about the transcription of paramyxovirus cRNA is how it is regulated to ensure the synthesis of both long and short transcripts. One possibility is that all transcripts are full length but that some are subsequently cleaved, perhaps in stages, to produce monocistronic messengers. Alternatively, one would have to postulate that a transcriptase, perhaps different from the known virion transcriptase, has the capacity to \"read through\" the punctuation points in vRNA. Elucidation of this interesting situation will have significance extending well beyond the confines of the paramyxoviruses.\n\nThe transcriptase found associated with the nucleocapsid of the virion (Huang et ah, 1971; Robinson, 1971a; Stone et ah, 1971 ) may be the RNAdependent RNA polymerase that is found in quantity late in the multiplication cycle in the \"microsomal fraction\" of the cytoplasm (Mahy et ah, 1970) . Both enzymes require Mg 2 + and the four ribonucleoside triphosphates, have a temperature optimum of 28 \u00b0C and a pH optimum of 8, are not inhibited by actinomycin D, and produce short lengths of single-stranded cRNA in vitro. et al., 1966) large aggregations of RNP can be seen to accumulate in the cytoplasm. With some paramyxoviruses, notably the measles-rinderpest-distemper subgroup, nuclear inclusions are also detectable by these means or, indeed, by conventional staining techniques, but the protein that accumulates in the nucleus may play no vital role in multiplication (Llanes-Rodas and Liu, 1965).\n\nThe assembly of paramyxoviruses has been comprehensively studied in Choppin's laboratory (reviews, Choppin et ah, 1971; Compans and Choppin, 1971). First, the viral glycoproteins become incorporated into the plasma mem-brane; erythrocytes or ferritin-conjugated antibody are capable of adhering to such areas of membrane. Then three morphological changes became apparent in the particular areas from which budding occurs: (1) the glycoproteins assume their characteristic spikelike appearance, (2) an electron-dense layer (presumably M protein) develops on the inside of the plasma membrane beneath these spikes, and (3) nucleocapsids align themselves under the thickened membrane. Only when and where these three changes are apparent does budding occur (Plate 6-2). In addition to spherical particles, long filaments are produced, usually containing multiple nucleocapsids, only one of which is required for infectivity (Compans et ah, 1966; Hosaka et ah, 1966) .\n\nThough we have arbitrarily listed the morphological changes leading up to budding in a particular order, the precise sequence of events is not yet known. Much must depend on the affinity that each species of viral protein has for other proteins and for the lipids of the plasma membrane.\n\nThe membrane protein (M) appears to be the target to which RNP homes; the two proteins doubtless have an affinity for one another. Coinfection with SV5 and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) produces many phenotypically mixed progeny with the bullet-shaped morphology and the nucleocapsid (and therefore the genome) of VSV, plus all the VSV proteins together with the two SV5 peplomer glycoproteins but no SV5 M protein (McSharry et ah, 1971) . This is consistent with the hypothesis that VSV M protein is recognized only by VSV ribonucleoprotein.\n\nParamyxovirus nucleocapsids may accumulate in huge cytoplasmic inclusions clearly demonstrable by electron microscopy (Plate 6-2), or by light microscopy, where they are seen as the large, irregular, acidophilic inclusions that characterize the Paramyxovirus genus. In the virus-cell systems that have been studied, the extent of the excess accumulation of nucleocapsids seems to be inversely proportional to the yield of infectious virus (Compans et ah, 1966) .\n\nIn general, the paramyxoviruses do not cause a dramatic shutdown of synthesis of cellular macromolecules. Clearly, there is negligible damage in the case of the persistent infections. The most detailed studies have been confined to NDV, which does suppress the synthesis of cellular RNA, protein, and DNA (Wheelock and Tamm, 1961) following the synthesis of viral protein (Wilson, 1968) . The extent of the shutdown varies greatly from strain to strain; there appears to be some correlation with virulence for the chicken but it is by no means absolute (Moore et ah, 1972) . Thacore and Youngner (1970) showed that there is no simple association between cell shutdown and CPE, because host protein and RNA synthesis was depressed less rapidly in chick fibroblasts than PLATE 6-2. Stages of Paramyxovirus multiplication (bars = 100 nm). Different stages of multiplication of paramyxovirus SV5 (from Compans et ah, 1966) \n\nBudding from the plasma membrane, with some filamentous forms. (Courtesy Dr. P. W. Choppin.) (1971) have drawn attention to the fact that increased incorporation of radioactive thymidine into cellular DNA, such as they observed between 0.5 and 1.5 hours after infection of Sendai virus-infected cells, does not always mean increased DNA synthesis; since they found no increase in 32 P incorporation into DNA they postulated a transient block in the endogenous pathway of thymidine synthesis.\n\nThe paramyxoviruses have a special capacity to cause cells to fuse together to form a multinucleated giant cell known as a \"polykaryocyte\" or \"syncytium\" (Okada, 1962). Sendai virus and NDV, in particular, have been extensively studied from this point of view. Two types of virus-induced fusion can be distinguished: \"fusion from without\" and \"fusion from within\" (Bratt and Gallaher, 1970; see also Chapter 9). Fusion from without probably results from the fusion of the viral envelope to the plasma membranes of adjacent cells so causing them to flow together. It has been postulated to be due to the hemolysin since both activities are destroyed under conditions that fail to destroy the hemagglutinating activity or infectivity of the virion (Barbanti-Brodano et al., et al., 1967) , and occurs very rapidly (1-3 hours or less) at high multiplicity.\n\nFusion from within is one of the characteristic cytopathic effects of paramyxoviruses in cell culture and in vivo, occurring to different extents with different virus strains and cell types. The effect is often most pronounced following infection at low multiplicity; it requires protein synthesis and is enhanced at high pH (8.3), the change develops only late in the cycle, and may be blocked by antiviral antiserum as late as 5.5 hours after infection (Bratt and Gallaher, 1970). The mechanism may be similar to that of fusion from without, namely fusion of the envelope of newly synthesized, extracellular or budding virus to the plasma membrane of an adjacent cell, or fusion of a virus-specific area of the plasma membrane of a cell to that of an adjacent cell. However, Poste (1970) has proposed that the necessary modification of the plasma membrane might be brought about by released lysosomal enzymes.\n\nThe human coronaviruses were discovered relatively recently and at first could only be satisfactorily grown in organ cultures of human embryonic nasal, trach\u00e9al, or esophageal epithelium (Almeida and Tyrrell, 1967; review, Bradburne and Tyrrell, 1971). Consequently, nothing is yet known about the biochemistry of their replication; studies so far have been restricted to electron microscopy. W. Becker et al. (1967) examined WI-38 cells infected with the human coronavirus strain 229E, and chick embryo choriollantoic membrane infected with avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). In both cases, the virus was found to bud into cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum and cytoplasmic vesicles, but not from the plasma membrane. Budding was preceded by a pronounced crescent-shaped protein thickening in the membrane. No helical nucleocapsids were seen at any stage during the latent period (6-12 hours depending on multiplicity) or the subsequent 12-hour period of viral production. Oshiro et al.\n\n(1971) confirmed these findings and also observed cytoplasmic inclusions containing virions and tubular structures within a granular matrix. The optimum temperature of growth is 33\u00b0-35\u00b0C, not 37 \u00b0C, and the optimum pH near 7.0 (Bradburne and Tyrrell, 1971).\n\nVirions of a great variety of shapes and sizes bud from those areas in the plasma membrane where viral peplomers have been incorporated (Murphy et al., 1970; Plate 3-18). Ribosomes are regularly enclosed within the virion, and are also prominent in aggregates within the cytoplasmic inclusions demonstrable by immunofluorescence.\n\nDetailed studies with this genus have been focused on the relatively safe and rapidly growing vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV).\n\nVesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) grows extremely rapidly to high titers in cell culture, the latent period being 2.5 hours, with yields approaching 10 5 virions per cell.\n\nAs with other enveloped viruses, there is evidence for entry by both phagocytosis and fusion. Simpson et ah (1969) have published electron micrographs showing cytosis. On the other hand, Heine and Schnaitman (1971) presented convincing evidence of fusion of viral envelope to cell membrane. Following adsorption at 4\u00b0C, they raised the temperature to 37 \u00b0C and within 10 minutes demonstrated by f er ri tin-conjugated antibody labeling viral antigens distributed throughout patches of plasma membrane. Cell fractionation revealed the envelope proteins, G and M, to be in cytoplasmic membranes, whereas the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) was found free in the cytoplasmic sap. Evidence is still lacking as to whether both modes of entry are equally likely to lead to successful initiation of infection.\n\nThe transcriptase of the vesicular stomatitis virion (Baltimore et ah, 1970) transcribes the complete viral genome in vitro into small molecules of cRNA (Bishop, 1971) . Purified RNP, together with its four associated minor proteins, comprises the active transcription complex, indicating that the enzyme transcribes the RNA template while it is still firmly attached to protein N (Bishop and Roy, 1972) . The enzyme does not catalyze viral RNA replication; all the in vitro product is hybridizable to vRNA, which itself shows no self-annealing (Bishop and Roy, 1971; Baltimore et ah, 1971) .\n\nTranscription of mRNA from the parental genome in vivo can be studied in the absence of RNA replication by preventing translation with cycloheximide (Marcus et ah, 1971 ). Using this inhibitor and an inoculum of purified B particles, Huang and Manders (1972) were able to show that the whole viral genome is transcribed in vivo into two main types of cRNA, one with a sedimentation coefficient of 28 S (not transcribed in vitro), and the other a heterogeneous collection of about 13-15 S. Both classes of cRNA almost certainly represent mRNA since they are labeled in brief radioactive pulses and are found in polyribosomes from which they may be released by EDTA (Stampfer et ah, 1969; Huang et ah, 1970; Mudd and Summers, 1970b; Petric and Prevec, 1970; Schincariol and Howatson, 1970) . The 13-15 S (or 10-16 S) material can be resolved by gel electrophoresis into at least one-half dozen size classes representing a molecular weight range of about 0.25 to 1 million daltons, which would correspond quite closely with the sizes of putative monocistronic messengers for the known viral proteins (Wild, 1971; Huang and Manders, 1972). Following transcription, poly A is added to these monocistronic mRNA's (Mudd and Summers, 1970b; Huang and Manders, 1972).\n\nThe transcriptive intermediate (TI) has not been positively identified but is probably present in the partially RNase-resistant material sedimenting heterogeneously at around 30 S, which is rapidly labeled, mainly in the short cRNA molecules released on melting (Stampfer et al., 1969; Mudd and Summers, 1970b; Wild, 1971). As newly synthesized vRNA associates rapidly with protein N (Huang et al., 1970; Mudd and Summers, 1970b) , it is quite likely that the nucleocapsid, rather than naked vRNA, serves as the main template for transcription late as well as early in the cycle.\n\nWhen crude mixtures of B and T particles are used as inoculum the situation is much more complicated. Late in the cycle, in particular, in noncycloheximidetreated cells, besides vRNA (40 S), cRNA (13-15 and 28 S), TI, RI, and RF, a confusing range of shorter RNA's are made which doubtless represent vRNA, cRNA, TI, RI, and RF of T particle origin. The situation has been systematically clarified by Stampfer et al. and will be discussed in detail in the section on T particles. However, there are two reports suggesting the existence of a nonglycosylated precursor of the peplomer glycoprotein, G. Kang and Prevec (1971) believe this to be an intracellular precursor which migrates somewhat more rapidly than the virion equivalent, while Printz and Wagner (1971) have presented evidence for the production of an unglycosylated spike glycoprotein by one of their ts mutants at nonpermissive temperature.\n\nThe glycoprotein, G, is found chiefly in smooth and plasma membranes, as is the membrane protein, M, in smaller quantities. The nucleoprotein, N, forms a pool, free in cytoplasm, which can be \"chased\" into plasma membrane (Wagner et al., 1970; Cohen et al., 1971a) . Proteins M and L are incorporated into virions shortly after being synthesized, whereas there is a longer delay with N and G (Kang and Prevec, 1971) . Coh\u00e9n et al (1971a) have pointed out the importance of including appropriate controls in experiments purporting to demonstrate the location of viral proteins in membranes in vivo, because soluble VSV proteins, particularly M, adsorb strongly to plasma membranes isolated from normal cells.\n\nThe transcription of monocistronic cRNA molecules may be an excellent way of producing proteins without the necessity for posttranslational cleavage, but it is hard to imagine such short molecules being intermediates in RNA replication. A transcriptase that may or may not be identical with the one carried in the virion must transcribe cRNA molecules of full length which would then serve as template for the synthesis of vRNA. Little is yet known about this process, but Baltimore et al. (1971) have reported finding some such long cRNA strands in VSV-infected cells among a large excess of vRNA.\n\nThe replicative intermediate (RI) is probably to be found along with the TI in the rapidly labeled, heterogeneously sedimenting, partially RNase-resistant RNA already described (Stampfer et al, 1969; Mudd and Summers, 1970b) . Replicase activity has not been convincingly separated from transcriptase (Wilson and Bader, 1965) but the description of two distinct complementation groups of ts mutants defective in RNA synthesis suggests the existence of two polymerases (Wunner and Pringle, 1972) .\n\nVSV is released by budding, mainly from the plasma membrane (Howatson and Whitmore, 1962), but with some virus-cell combinations budding occurs predominantly into cytoplasmic vesicles (Zee et ah, 1970) . The process has been discussed in detail for paramyxoviruses, as has also the work of McSharry et al. (1971) demonstrating the key role of VSV membrane protein (M) in serving as a specific attachment site for the nucleocapsid of VSV rather than SV5 in phenotypically mixed rhabdovirions from doubly-infected cells. The fact that the length of T particles bears a fairly direct relationship to the length of the abbreviated RNA they contain suggests that only the area of M proteinlined membrane to which RNP is adsorbed is thrust out as a budding virion. Conversely, abnormally long particles are found to contain multiple nucleocapsids.\n\nMost of the rhabdoviruses whose morphogenesis has been examined by electron microscopy acquire their envelopes by budding (review, Howatson, 1970 ). However, Hummeler (1971 has interpreted some of his findings as demonstrating de novo synthesis of rabiesvirus envelope in cytoplasmic inclusions (Negri bodies). Viral nucleocapsids in the unwound form become recognizable in these inclusions, then arrays of bullet-shaped particles appear in the filamentous matrix. With other strains of rabies (and VSV), however, Hummeler and his colleagues find that virions mature only by budding. Matsumoto and Kawai (1969) also described a difference between the budding behavior of rabiesvirus in different types of host tissue; in neurons viral morphogenesis was completely restricted to intracytoplasmic membranes closely associated with viral inclusions, whereas in cultured chick fibroblasts budding was from the plasma membranes.\n\nMudd and Summers (1970b) produced some evidence for the preferential transcription of the smallest class of VSV cRNA molecules but a definitive answer must await the clear resolution by gel electrophoresis of the three main cRNA classes into pure populations of individual molecules.\n\nThere is certainly some control, perhaps at the level of translation, over the rate of synthesis of VSV proteins, because they are not found in equimolar proportions. The nucleocapsid protein (N) is made in excess and forms a large cytoplasmic pool of nucleocapsid, while the membrane protein (M) is made in limiting amounts (Wagner et ah, 1970) . Moreover, the rate of synthesis of individual proteins fluctuates with time (Kang and Prevec, 1971 ). Whereas NS is made predominantly early in the cycle, and is therefore presumed to have an early function, the two envelope proteins (M and G) are made progressively more rapidly as infection progresses.\n\nThe extent of cell shutdown varies greatly from one rhabdovirus to another. It is minimal, for example, in the case of persistent infections by rabiesvirus, where infected cells continue to produce virus almost indefinitely. On the other hand, VSV, which as usual is the only rhabdovirus to have been at all closely examined from this point of view, does suppress the synthesis of cellular macromolecules.\n\nAt high multiplicity, infectious or UV-inactivated VSV B or T particles suppress the synthesis of host RNA and protein (Huang and Wagner, 1965; Wagner et ah, 1970) . Presumably this particular phenomenon results from the toxic action of proteins contained in the inoculum because the UV-irradiated particles have nonfunctional RNA. There is, however, another mechanism of suppression of cellular protein synthesis which seems to be dependent on translation of a viral protein (Wertz and Youngner, 1972) . This is brought about by live virus only and does not occur in the presence of cycloheximide. Rather unexpectedly, cellular protein synthesis was found to be suppressed more rapidly by a small-plaque mutant (90% by 2 hours) than by a large-plaque mutant (90% by 8 hours). Huang et ah (1970) demonstrated the breakdown of polyribosomes by their strain of VSV during the third hour after infection and reformation of a quite different population of smaller virus-specific polysomes, reaching a peak during the fourth hour.\n\nThe T (truncated) VSV particles described by Cooper and Bellett (1959) and then by Hackett (1964) have been designated DI (defective interfering)-T par-tides by Stampfer et ah (1971) to emphasize their two main characteristics: a total lack of infectivity in the absence of infectious (B) particles, and the capacity to interfere specifically with the replication of B. The majority of DI-T particles described in the literature are one-third the length of the B particle, but it is now appreciated that with different virus strains and cell types a wide variety of sizes are possible (review, Huang and Baltimore, 1970b).\n\nPrevec and Kang (1970) described two classes of T particles formed by their particular VSV strain, only the longer of which would interfere successfully with a heterologous strain. The length of the T particle is also characteristic of the parent strain in the case of Pringle's ts mutants (Reichmann et al. f 1971) . Some of these mutants yield predominantly DI-T particles on undiluted passage at the permissive temperature. Autointerference by DI-T particles is more readily demonstrable in certain cell types than in others (Perrault and Holland, 1972b). (Stampfer et ah, 1969) . Clearly, transcription of T RNA is not required in order that interference occur. This conclusion is indirectly supported by the observation that, although DI-T particles from any of Pringle's ts mutants will interfere with the multiplication of wild-type B particles, none of them are able to complement ts B mutants from other complementation groups (Reichmann et ah, 1971) . Furthermore, Sreevalsan (1970b) has produced interference with purified RNA from T particles. The current hypothesis, therefore, is that T RNA specifically interferes with B RNA replication (but not transcription) by binding the VSV replicase with high affinity (Stampfer et ah, 1969; Sreevalsan, 1970b ).\n\nmation influences the multiplication of the superinfecting virus. Second, there is good evidence that an essential step early in the multiplication of the leukoviruses involves the synthesis of DNA and there is much circumstantial data to indicate that this DNA is a copy of the incoming RNA genome. In most virusinfected as well as in uninfected cells the prevailing flow of information is from DNA to RNA. In leukovirus-infected cells at least some information travels in the reverse direction, that is from RNA to DNA. In all probability this novel transfer is mediated by the RNA-dependent DNA polymerases which are an integral part of all infectious leukoviruses. Many facets of the multiplication of leukoviruses and their effects on the host cells are described in Chapter 14; here we shall consider only the events that follow orthodox \"infection\" of chick cells with virions of avian leukosis or Rous sarcoma virus.\n\nThe growth rates of different strains of avian leukosis virus vary considerably (Hanafusa and Hanafusa, 1966) , but as with most other viruses, attention has been focused on systems in which events are highly synchronized and relatively rapid (Hanafusa, 1969b; Bader, 1972b) . The progress of infection may be measured either by titrating cell-associated and extracellular infectivity (Vogt and Rubin, 1963; Fig. 6-1) or by observing the morphological transformation of cells infected with Rous sarcoma virus (Hanafusa, 1969b) .\n\nThe capacity of chick cells to support leukovirus infection is genetically determined (see Table 14 -1). Attachment of virions is unaffected by the susceptibility of the cells in question; the specificity of blocking that is related to the envelope glycoproteins of the virion (virus-attachment interference; see Chapter 8) occurs at the penetration step (Piraino, 1967) . Dales and Hanafusa (1972) have drawn attention to the existence of morphologically distinguishable attachment sites on the surface of chick embryo cells.\n\nAs with other enveloped viruses, there are proponents for the views that whole virions are engulfed (Sarkar et ah, 1970; Dales and Hanafusa, 1972) or that the nucleoid enters after fusion of the viral envelope and the plasma membrane (Miyamoto and Gilden, 1971) . After penetration, inoculum particles move rapidly to the perinuclear zone, and autoradiography shows that at least some of the viral RNA enters the nucleus, where most of the events that follow take place.\n\nIn contrast to all other RNA viruses, \"transcription\" in the case of leukoviruses involves two processes: the production of proviral DNA from the input viral RNA and the subsequent synthesis of mRNA on this DNA template.\n\nTranscription of DNA from Viral RNA. The idea that the multiplication of leukoviruses might be different from that of other RNA viruses was first suggested by Temin (1962) , on the basis of experiments which showed that the structure carrying viral information in transformed cells was inherited in a regular fashion at cell division (Temin, 1960) . The chemical nature of this structure was left undefined until Temin (1964) proposed that the \"provirus\" was DNA, a notion that many virologists found difficult to accept at that time. However, several new discoveries, added to the earlier observations, have confirmed Temin's views.\n\n1. The multiplication of leukoviruses is inhibited by actinomycin D, a drug which blocks specifically the transcription of DNA into RNA (Bader, 1965) . This result suggests that viral RNA is made directly from DNA templates rather than from the RNA replicative intermediate familiar with other RNA viruses ( Fig. 6-2) . In fact, double-stranded RNA has never been found in cells infected by leukoviruses, and no RNA complementary to viral RNA can be detected at all in leukovirus-infected cells (Coffin and Temin, 1972) .\n\n2. By using specific inhibitors of DNA synthesis, it has been shown that initiation of leukovirus production requires the synthesis of a new species of DNA (Bader, 1966) . The synthesis of this DNA occurs in the absence of protein synthesis (Bader, 1966 (Bader, , 1972a suggesting that the enzymes responsible preexist in the cell or are carried in as part of the virion. In cells infected with high multiplicity of Rous sarcoma virus, the synthesis of DNA begins at about 1.5 hours and is completed by 6 or 7 hours after infection.\n\n3. There is good kinetic evidence that at least some of the newly synthesized DNA contains viral sequences. Boettiger and Temin (1970) and Balduzzi and Morgan (1970) have shown that if 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR) is present during the time of synthesis of the DNA the provirus is rendered lightsensitive. Furthermore, the presence of BUdR during provirus synthesis induces both lethal and conditional lethal mutants of Rous sarcoma virus (Bader and Bader, 1970; Bader and Brown, 1971) . In all probability the proviral DNA is synthesized from the incoming viral RNA using the virion-associated RNAdependent DNA polymerase (Baltimore, 1970; Temin and Mizutani, 1970) . The virions of all infectious leukoviruses so far examined contain endogenous polymerase systems capable of synthesizing DNA copies of virion RNA (see Chapters 3 and 14), and mutants which lack these systems are noninfectious (Hanafusa and Hanafusa, 1971) .\n\n4. At least some cells transformed by RNA tumor viruses contain increased amounts of DNA that will hybridize to viral RNA (Baluda and Nayak, 1970) . The total amount of proviral DNA synthesized after infection is unknown, but because resistance to DNA inhibitors increases logarithmically after infection (Bader, 1972a) it is likely that several copies are made. However, in spite of many attempts no one has yet been able to isolate the newly formed proviral DNA.\n\nTranscription and Translation of mRNA. In order to account for the genetic stability of transformed cells it is believed that at least one of the newly synthesized copies of proviral DNA becomes integrated into the cellular DNA and is transmitted to the daughter cells at mitosis. RNA is transcribed from the pro-viral DNA by one or other cellular DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Presumably this RNA serves two functions; it may act as mRNA and direct the synthesis of virus-specific proteins or it may be incorporated into the genome of newly synthesized virions.\n\nThe mechanism of these processes is unknown. However, virus-specific RNA can be detected in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of chick cells transformed by Rous sarcoma virus (Leong et al., 1972) . This RNA is heterogeneous in size, with molecules longer than unit length viral RNA in the nucleus and shorter molecules in the cytoplasm. Infected cells contain about 6000 genome equivalents of viral RNA (Coffin and Temin, 1972) and as much as 1% of the total cell RNA may contain viral sequences. Presumably some of this RNA is messenger, and becomes attached to cytoplasmic ribosomes where it is translated into viral proteins. Immunofluorescence studies reveal that some of the internal antigens of the virion are assembled in the nucleus, and later migrate to the cytoplasm, whereas the glycoproteins that form the peplomers of the envelope accumulate in the plasma membrane (Vogt and Rubin, 1961; Payne et al., 1966) . Lai and Duesberg (1972b) have recently reported that the glycopeptides obtained by pronase digestion of glycoproteins of avian leukoviruses released from transformed cells are larger than those of the corresponding strains released from normal cells.\n\nIt will be clear from the foregoing account that it is difficult to separate the processes leading to the formation of new viral RNA that will be incorporated into progeny virions from the synthesis of viral mRNA. Both are believed to be transcribed from integrated proviral DNA. Viral RNA enters virions about 1 hour after it has been synthesized (Bader, 1970; Baluda and Nayak, 1969; Okano and Rich, 1969) .\n\nLeukoviruses lend themselves to electron microscopic study; most of the earlier studies of them, and many current papers, deal with the detection of characteristic \"C-type particles\" as they assemble at the plasma membrane and are released by budding. Differences in assembly and release that distinguish the viruses of subgenus A and subgenus B were described in Chapter 3. The leukoviruses are the only viruses known to change morphologically after leaving the cell. The chemical alterations involved in this postbudding \"maturation\" have only just begun to be analyzed (Cheung et al., 1972; Canaani et al., 1973) . Rous sarcoma virions harvested within 3-5 minutes of budding differ from those harvested an hour or more later in a number of respects. Initially the RNA is mainly of the 30-40 S class, but with time it appears to associate with 4-12 S \"primer\" RNA to form 60-70 S RNA.\n\nLeukoviruses are quite unlike other viruses in their effects on cellular metabolism. In no circumstances are they cytocidal. In the fully integrated form, the viral genome may be carried as repressed \"cellular\" genes, or expression may be limited to the production of one or a few antigens (see Chapters 12 and 14). After superinfection of chick cells (which already carry an integrated viral genome) with avian leukoviruses one of two results follows: with the nontransforming avian leukosis viruses, virions are released but the cells are essentially unchanged, whereas with the sarcoma viruses the cells are morphologically transformed and multiply with less restraint than normal cells (see Chapter 14).\n\nA remarkable amount of information has accumulated on the molecular biology of reovirus multiplication since the first edition of this book was published. Each of the ten double-stranded RNA molecules of the genome has been identified as a separate gene (see Chapter 3) and the corresponding mRNA's transcribed in vitro by the transcriptase present in the core of the virion have been translated in a mammalian cell-free system into eight of the ten viral proteins (McDowell et ah, 1972) . The structural role of several of the seven virion proteins is now known (see Chapter 3) and using in vitro systems we can soon expect to learn something about the nonstructural proteins and the regulatory mechanisms that program the multiplication cycle. Equally promising are the ts mutants whose properties are reviewed in Chapter 7.\n\nReovirus multiplication has been recently reviewed by Shatkin (1971), Joklik and Zweerink (1971), and Millward and Graham (1971) .\n\nMost of the work on this genus has been done with reovirus type 3 growing in suspensions of L cells. After infection at high multiplicity, virus begins to appear intracellularly after a latent period of 6 hours and maximum yields of just over 1000 pfu per cell (20,000 virions) are reached by 16-18 hours (Silverstein and Dales, 1968) . Since actinomycin D in moderate doses does not block multiplication it can be used to depress cellular protein synthesis (Gauntt and Graham, 1969; Shatkin, 1969) . Multiplication is restricted to the cytoplasm and is often associated with spindle tubules (Rhim et ah, 1962; Dales, 1963b) . Characteristic eosinophilic crescentic perinuclear inclusions are seen by conventional staining methods; these contain both single-and double-stranded RNA's, capsid proteins, and virions (Gomatos et ah, 1962; Rhim et ah, 1962; Dales et ah, 1965b; Mayor and Jordan, 1965; Silverstein and Dales, 1968 ).\n\nThe mechanisms of entry and uncoating of reovirions have been elucidated by Silverstein and Dales (1968) . The sequence of events bears a striking similarity to that seen with the poxviruses, which also multiply in the cytoplasm and contain a transcriptase within the inner protein core.\n\nVirions are taken into the cell by cytosis. The phagocytic vacuole then fuses with a lysosome to produce a \"phagosome,\" in which intact virions can be clearly visualized by electron microscopy (Plate 6-3) . The outer capsid is then sin digestion of virions are similar but lack the \u03bc2 cleavage product. This first stage of uncoating is accomplished within about an hour of infection and occurs even in the presence of cycloheximide. Indeed, it seems that most virions never become completely uncoated, but remain as subviral particles throughout the multiplication cycle (Schonberg et al., 1971; Silverstein et al, 1972) . Removal of \u03c3 3 is sufficient to activate the transcriptase and subviral particles produce mRNA for many hours.\n\nThe in vivo product of the transcriptase consists of ten separate and distinct classes of single-stranded RNA which can be hybridized to the ten doublestranded virion RNA's of the corresponding size classes (Shatkin et al., 1968; Watanabe et al., 1968b; Fig. 6-4 ). The precise characterization of these transcripts has been greatly facilitated by the discovery that chymotrypsin-derived cores are prolific producers of such single-stranded RNA in vitro (Shatkin and Sipe, 1968b).\n\nFIG. 6-4. Tracings from acrylamide gel autoradio grams showing relative rates of formation of reovirus mRNA species during the infection cycle (a to d), as determined by hybridizing labeled RNA from the cytoplasm of infected cells to an excess of genome RNA; compared with the tracing of genome Rh\u00ceA derived from virions (e). (From Zweerink and Joklik, 1970.) The transcriptase of the core, which is activated by removal of the outer capsid, requires Mg 2 \" 1 \" or Mn 2 + and functions optimally at a temperature of 50 \u00b0C or more, transcribing all ten single-stranded RNA's at a constant rate of at least a dozen nucleotides per second for 2 days at 37 \u00b0C. There is no transcriptional control in vitro, i.e., the number of molecules of each class of RNA transcribed is inversely proportional to its molecular weight; the parental double-stranded RNA template is conserved (Skehel and Joklik, 1969) et al, 1971). (Unpublished photograph, Gillies et al, 1972, courtesy Dr. A. R. Bellamy.) being that each virion must contain at least ten functional transcriptase molecules. It appears that the transcripts may leave the core through the twelve hollow capsomers at its vertices (Luftig et ah, 1972) . Zweerink and Joklik (1970) have suggested that the whole inner core may consist of polymeric transcriptase molecules constructed of the polypeptides \u03bb\u03b9, \u03bb 2 , and \u03c3 2 .\n\nAll ten single-stranded RNA transcripts have the same polarity, as indicated by the fact that there is no self-annealing of the product; it can be concluded that only one strand of the double-stranded template is transcribed (Schonberg et ah, 1971; Sakuma and Watanabe, 1971) . Recently, McDowell et ah (1972) have formally demonstrated that the transcripts represent monocistronic mRNA molecules. In a cell-free extract from rabbit reticulocytes, single-stranded RNA's transcribed from chymotrypsin cores in vitro were translated into all eight of the known reovirus-coded polypeptides.\n\nAll classes of reovirus mRNA have (p)ppG at their 5' end (Levin et ah, 1970a ) and cytosine at the 3' terminus (Banerjee et ah, 1971) . Nichols et ah (1972b) have determined the twenty-five nucleotides from the 5' end of mRNA of the s class and found that the first nine, (p)ppGCCAUUUUU, correspond with the sequence known to occur in the untranslated region at the 5' ends and the intercistronic regions of certain RNA phages. They postulate that it represents the ribosome attachment site, the polymerase recognition site, or the binding site for a linker. The initiation codon was not present in the first twenty-five residues, hence, must be even further in. Levin et ah (1972) have presented evidence for the existence of an AUG initiator codon somewhere in reovirus mRNA of all three size classes; Met-tRNAF, the usual initiator of protein synthesis in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems, was found to form a complex with reoviral mRNA at a puromycin reactive site on mouse fibroblast L-929 ribosomes in vitro. Nichols et al. (1972a) propose that the 3000 or so oligonucleotides found in the average reovirion may be the product of abortive transcription. The 5'-Gterminated oligonucleotides resemble the sequence at the 5' end of reovirus mRNA; the authors postulate that for the short time during which the sub viral particle is acquiring its outer capsid as the final step in the assembly process, the transcriptase may continue to initiate successfully but be physically constrained from completing transcription; they calculate that the entire oligoucleotide complement of the virion could be transcribed in less than 3 minutes. The other major species of oligonucleotide in the reovirion, polyadenylate (Bellamy and Joklik, 1967; Shatkin and Sipe, 1968a) , could arise by reiterative copying of the short sequences of U known to occur near the 5' terminus of reovirus s mRNA (Nichols et ah, 1972a, b) .\n\nBy 4 hours after infection, acrylamide gel electrophorograms of infected cells resolve all seven structural reovirus proteins (Loh and Shatkin, 1968; R. Smith et ah, 1969) , one of which, /X2, is a cleavage product of \u03bc\\ (Zweerink et ah, 1971 ). In addition, Zweerink et ah have detected two nonstructural proteins, \u03bc\u03bf and \u03c3 2 \u0391, making a total of eight primary gene products (Fig. 3-10) ; two additional nonstructural proteins must be made in trace amounts or comigrate with others on the gel, because all ten species of mRNA are recoverable from polysomes (Ward et al., 1972) . The nine virus-specific proteins described are those identifiable in L cells infected at 31 \u00b0C; at 37\u00b0C three others arise late in the cycle as a result of proteolytic cleavage (perhaps an artifact) of \u03bc\u03b9 or /*2 (Zweerink et al., 1971) .\n\nIn vitro L cell ribosomes using endogenous reovirus mRNA make the same eight primary gene products, but there is no cleavage of \u03bc\u03b9 -\u00bb w, or of \u03bc>\u03b9 or \u03bc 2 -\u00bb XYZ (McDowell and Joklik, 1971).\n\nThe template for the synthesis of new double-stranded RNA in vivo or in vitro is single-stranded mRNA (Schonberg et ah, 1971) . In other words, single-stranded \"+\" RNA serves as the template both for the translation of viral proteins and for the replication of viral RNA. Following a short pulse with radioactive uridine all the label is found in the \"-\" strand of double-stranded product. Whereas single \"+\" strands (mRNA) are transcribed from doublestranded RNA templates and accumulate in the cytoplasm during the first 8 hours after infection, single \"-\" strands are never found in a free state in vivo or in vitro but exclusively in double-stranded RNA.\n\nObviously an enzyme other than the virion transcriptase is required to catalyze the production of these double-stranded molecules from single-stranded mRNA. Such an enzyme (\"replicase\") making double-stranded RNA of all size classes, was recovered from L cells by Watanabe et al. (1968a); it was first detectable 4 hours after infection and reached maximum levels by 8 hours. Replicase and transcriptase activities, still template-bound, have been isolated separately from infected cells (Sakuma and Watanabe, 1971). However, the authors have pointed out that the two enzymes are not necessarily completely different; the replicase could conceivably be converted into the transcriptase when the enzyme-template complex associates with additional protein to form the subviral particle.\n\nVirions are assembled in cytoplasmic \"factories\" in perinuclear locations often in association with spindle tubules (Dales et ah, 1965b; Mayor and Jordan, 1965; Silverstein and Dales, 1968), though this association is not essential because colchicine does not inhibit reovirus growth (Dales, 1963b) . The inclusions are seen by electron microscopy to contain crystalline aggregates (and single particles) of virions, empty virions, and subviral particles within a matrix of fine filaments (Plate 6-3). Virions are released from the cell either singly or in such aggregates, over several hours, without budding. Subviral particles are intermediates in the assembly of virions. Astell et ah (1972) have constructed virions (as identified by electron microscopy and buoyant density) by mixing subviral particles with soluble proteins from infected cells. The main outer capsid protein, \u03c3 3/ together with small amounts of \u03bc and \u03c3\u03b9, were specifically the proteins selected from the pool. Transcriptase activity ceased with the attachment of \u03c3 3 and could be activated again by removal of the same protein with chymotrypsin. Cleavage of /M -\u00bb \u03bc2 may also represent a late step in morphogenesis (Zweerink et al, 1971) .\n\nSome of the ts mutants of Fields et al. (1971) and Ikegami and Gomatos (1972) accumulate subviral particles, whereas others accumulate empty capsids at the nonpermissive temperature. If these represent true \"assembly\" mutants they could provide rapid insight into the morphogenesis of the reovirion (review, Joklik and Zweerink, 1971).\n\nSerial transfer of reovirus at high multiplicity yields noninfectious progeny after six to eight passages (Nonoyama et al,. 1970) . The largest double-stranded RNA molecule is missing from these defective virions.\n\nAlthough neither transcription nor translation is regulated in vitro, both appear to be controlled in vivo. Watanabe et al. (1968b) reported that if doublestranded RNA synthesis is inhibited by cycloheximide added at the time of infection, only three or four of the mRNA species are transcribed, whereas in the absence of cycloheximide, Zweerink and Joklik (1970) found all ten species of mRNA to be transcribed in vivo at all times between 2 and 8 hours after infection in a molecular ratio that remained constant throughout the cycle. There was a tendency for the number of molecules of each species transcribed to be inversely proportional to its molecular weight, mRNA of the I class being particularly scarce and s relatively plentiful, but there were several exceptions; e.g., si and s2 were transcribed only one-half as often as s3 and s4. Translation seemed to be independently controlled; five viral proteins were synthesized in abundance and others, notably \u03c3\u03b9, in very small amounts. With time the molecular ratio changed relatively little but those proteins comprising the outer capsid tended to be made in greater proportion later in the cycle.\n\nReplication of RNA begins as early as 3 hours after infection but is predominantly confined to the later part of the cycle. Most of the RNA synthesized for the first 8 hours after infection is single-stranded (+) mRNA; virions completed after that time contain double-stranded RNA labeled mainly in the \"-\" strand (Acs et al, 1971) .\n\nCellular macromolecular synthesis is not significantly affected until relatively late in the cycle. Host RNA synthesis is suppressed at high multiplicity of infection. Host protein synthesis is unaffected for the first 7 hours, and even by 9 hours has declined only 50% (Ensminger and Tamm, 1969; Zweerink and Joklik, 1970). The kinetics of shutdown of cellular DNA synthesis is very similar (Ensminger and Tamm, 1969) and results from a reduction in the number of initiation sites, not in the rate of chain growth (Hand and Tamm, 1972).\n\nBluetongue, the prototype of this genus (reviews, Verwoerd, 1970; Howell and Verwoerd, 1971) multiplies in BHK21 or L cells with a latent period of 4 hours, reaching maximum titers after 12 hours. Unlike the reoviruses, bluetongue shuts down cell protein synthesis quite rapidly (Huismans, 1971) .\n\nBluetongue virus shows the same correspondence of mRNA's and genome fragments as Reovirus (see Chapter 3). The ten genome segments are transcribed into ten species of mRNA whose molar ratios after in vitro or in vivo synthesis, and as isolated from polyribosomes, indicate that there is some specific regulation at the transcription level but probably not during the initial stages of translation (Huismans and Verwoerd, 1972). Further details of the molecular biology of viral multiplication have yet to be worked out.\n\nElectron microscopic studies of the growth cycles of several orbiviruses in cell culture and mouse brain indicate maturation within \"granular\" or \"reticular\" cytoplasmic inclusions containing many filaments and tubules; release occurs by cell lysis, not by budding (Murphy et ah, 1971a) ."}
