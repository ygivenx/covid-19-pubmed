{"title": "Supplementary Material A Recurrent Mutation in Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase with Distinct Neoepitope Conformations", "body": "Supplementary Table 1 . ProTECT analysis of 100 primary and 6 primary:relapsed pairs of TARGET NBL samples. The first column shows identified proteins (in italics) with their respective mutation observed in tumors. The second column shows the ImmunoActive Region of each protein with the format [X /Y] in bold denoting wild-type and mutant amino acids, respectively. The third column shows the number of samples with the expressed mutation in primary and relapsed patients. The fourth column shows the best predicted therapeutic MHC allele, which is defined as either an allele shared by samples expressing the same mutation or an allele with the best predicted binding score. For each allele, the frequency (denoted in parenthesis) is in Caucasian populations. The fifth column shows counts in COSMIC that refer to the sum total of unique entries in the Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer database (1) for each mutation. \n\nTyr9-OH Ser116-O\u03b3 2.6\n\nSupplementary Table 3 . Table detailing molecular interactions within 3.6 \u00c5 between residues of the nonamer (AQDIYRASY) and decamer (AQDIYRASYY) peptide and residues of the HLA-B*15:01 groove in our X-ray structures ( Figure 3 ).\n\nTyr10-OH Asp116-O\u03b41 2.5\n\nSupplementary Table 4 . Table detailing molecular interactions within 3.6 \u00c5 between residues of the decamer (AQDIYRASYY) peptide and residues of the HLA-A*01:01 groove in our X-ray structure ( Figure 3 ). , and (iv) control HLA allele (polyAla groove, green) where all the residues in the binding groove were replaced with an alanine. Y-axis shows R.E.U.: Rosetta Energy Units. X-axis represents each peptide residue. Anchor residues are indicated by an asterisk."}
