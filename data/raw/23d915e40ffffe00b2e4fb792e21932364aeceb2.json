{"title": "Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of phosphorodiamidate prodrugs of antiviral and anticancer nucleosides HHS Public Access", "body": "Nucleoside analogs (NAs) play a pivotal role in antiviral and anticancer therapy [1, 2] . They are structurally related to the natural nucleosides bearing modifications at the base and/or at the sugar moieties, which, in most of the cases, confer selectivity versus the desired targets [2] . NAs are prodrugs and they need to be converted into their active species, which usually consists of their 5\u2032-triphosphate form [3] . Their bioactivation pathway often involves three consecutive phosphorylation steps starting from the parent nucleoside, which is converted to its mono-, di-and finally triphosphate form. Some NAs, such as abacavir or famciclovir for instance, require also additional bioactivation steps in order to display their biological activity [4, 5] . The first step of phosphorylation is usually considered to be the rate-limiting step in the bioactivation of NAs, with few exceptions, such as zidovudine for which the second phosphorylation may be rate limiting [6] . After long-term treatment with NAs the activity of the nucleoside kinases involved in the first step of bioactivation may be decreased, therefore leading to drug resistance onset [7] . Several monophosphate prodrug strategies are currently under investigations to overcome these issues [8] , including the phosphoramidate ProTide approach developed in our group [9] [10] [11] . More recently the phosphorodiamidate technology applied to 6-O-alkyl-2\u2032-C-methylguanosine was reported by us as a new promising approach for the delivery of monophosphates inside the cell. Several stability studies on the 6-O-alkyl-2\u2032-C-methylguanosine diamidates have shown a good stability profile under different conditions such as acid (pH = 2) and mild basic buffer (pH = 8. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] , and in human serum [12] . This novel prodrug approach has been validated both in vitro and in vivo and some compounds are already under consideration for clinical studies [12] . Similarly, several acyclic nucleoside phosphonate diamidate prodrugs showed a better biological profile compared to the parent compounds [13] . In this approach two amino acid esters are introduced on the monophosphate moiety in order to mask the negative charges. As also in the case of the phosphoramidate diester approach of Wagner and colleagues [14] , the phosphorus in the symmetrical diamidate prodrug is achiral, thus avoiding the presence of diastereoisomeric mixtures as in the case of the phosphoramidate ProTide derivatives. In fact, it has been reported how two diastereoisomers may interact differently with the enzymes involved in the bioactivation pathway, thus leading to different biological profiles [15] . Moreover, the diamidate motif bears non-toxic and natural promoieties and obviate the need for a phenyl or naphthyl moiety. The putative bioactivation pathway of diamidate prodrugs, depicted in Scheme 1, is similar to the one reported for ProTides. The first step (a) may be mediated by an esterase or a carboxypeptidase-type enzyme, which is responsible for the cleavage of one of the two esters. This mechanism has been already described and supported by enzymatic experiments using 31 P NMR [12] . The second step (b) involves an intramolecular attack of the carboxylate anion to the phosphorus with elimination of the second amino acid and formation of a five-membered ring (mixed anhydride intermediate).\n\nSpontaneous hydrolysis (c) of the cycle then leads to the formation of an intermediate bearing two negative charges. Finally, for the last step (d), a phosphoramidase-type enzyme cleaves the P-N bond to form the NA monophosphate. diamidate approach to NAs with either antiviral or anticancer activity, and the novel prodrug compounds were evaluated for their biological activities. The NAs considered for this study are: 6-O-ethyl-2\u2032-deoxy-2\u2032-a-fluoro-2\u2032-b-C-methylguanosine (1), stavudine (d4T, 2), 2\u2032,3\u2032dideoxyadenosine (ddA, 3), zidovudine (AZT, 4), lamivudine (3TC, 5), N-acetyl-lamivudine (N-acetyl-3TC, 6), 4\u2032-azidouridine (4\u2032-AzU, 7), 4\u2032-azidocytidine (4\u2032-AzC, 8), ribavirin (RBV, 9) , acyclovir (ACV, 10), abacavir (ABC, 11), the bicyclic nucleoside analog 12 (BCNA, also known as Cf1743) and acadesine (AICA, 13) (Fig. 1) .\n\nDifferent synthetic conditions were necessary depending on solubility and reactivity issues of the parent nucleosides, and a total of twenty-five diamidates were synthesized. Based on the previous work published on ProTides and diamidates, we selected L-alanine (L-Ala) as the amino acid of choice with benzyl and 2,2-dimethylpropyl as preferred ester moieties. For some derivatives, methyl and cyclohexyl esters were considered and, in one case, D-alanine (D-Ala) was used as the amino acid moiety.\n\nAt first, we applied our previously reported successful methodology for the synthesis of anti-HCV 6-O-alkyl-2\u2032 -C-methylguanosine 5\u2032-phosphorodiamidates [12] to 6-O-ethyl-2\u2032deoxy-2\u2032-\u03b1-fluoro-2\u2032-\u03b2-C-methylguanosine 1, d4T 2, ddA 3, AZT 4, and 3TC 5. This procedure, called method A in this paper, is represented in Scheme 2.\n\nIn this strategy, the unprotected nucleoside dissolved in THF was treated with phosphorus oxychloride (1 equivalent) in the presence of triethylamine (1 equivalent) to generate a phosphorodichloridate intermediate ( 31 P NMR signal at ~7-8 ppm), which was not isolated. Then, an excess of the appropriate amino acid ester as p-toluene sulfonate (p-TSA) salt (usually 5 equivalents) and triethylamine (5-10 equivalents) were added, leading after stirring at room temperature for 18-20 h to the desired phosphorodiamidates 14-21 ( 31 P NMR signals at \u03b4 P ~ 11-14 ppm).\n\nInterestingly, in the case of 3TC (5) both 5\u2032-OH and 4-NH 2 functional groups reacted yielding the tetradiamidate derivative 22, and the N-4-diamidate derivative 23 (Scheme 3).\n\nHowever, when applied to the other NAs reported in this work, this method was not successful, probably due to a lack of solubility in the organic solvent used. Based on these findings, a modification of a synthetic approach reported by Yoshikawa et al. for the synthesis of monophosphate species was used [16] . This same method was previously reported for the synthesis of some phosphorodiamidates [17] .\n\nThis second strategy, named method B, was used for the synthesis of diamidates of 3TC (5), N-acetyl 3TC (6), 4\u2032-AzU (7), 4\u2032-AzC (8), RBV (9), ACV (10), ABC (11), Cf1743 (12) , and AICA (13) (Scheme 4). NMR (\u03b4 P = ~7). The addition of an excess of the appropriate amino acid ester salts in the presence of DIPEA or TEA yielded the desired phosphorodiamidates 24-40.\n\nThe arylphosphoramidate ProTide technology as a monophosphate prodrug approach has proven to be a powerful tool in terms of enhancing the biological activity, by-passing certain mechanisms of resistance, as well as extending the biological profile of several NAs. Moreover, the increased lipophilicity of these prodrugs may also lead to a better delivery inside the cells by passive diffusion, thus favoring a greater uptake of the drug. For instance, it has been reported how the application of the ProTide approach greatly enhanced the antiviral activity of the antihepatitis C virus (HCV) agent 2-amino-6-methoxy-9-(2-Cmethyl-\u03b2-D-ribofuranosyl) purine, [11] overcame the mechanisms of resistance for 5fluoro-2\u2032-deoxyuridine [18] and extended the biological profile of BVdU and ACV from antiherpetic to anticancer and anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) agents, respectively [19, 20] . In a similar context, the phosphorodiamidates reported here were tested versus different cancer cell lines as well as versus a range of viruses with the aim to investigate the full potential of this phosphate prodrug moiety. To probe the delivery of the monophosphate inside the cells, thus by-passing the first step of phosphorylation, thymidine kinase-deficient (TK \u2212 ) mutant cancer cells and herpes virus strains were also used. Table 1 reports the anticancer activity for d4T (2), ddA (3), 3TC (5), N-acetyl-3TC (6), ABC (11), AICA (13) and their respective phosphorodiamidates versus mouse lymphocytic leukemia cells (L1210), human T-lymphocyte cells (CEM), human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa), for which TK \u2212 mutant strains were also included (L1210-TK \u2212 , CEM-TK \u2212 , and HeLa-TK \u2212 ), colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2) and human colon carcinoma cells (Colo-320). As expected, d4T itself did not show any antiproliferative activity versus all the human cancer cell lines considered in this study. In the case of murine L1210, d4T showed cytostatic activity at ~9 \u03bcM, while it was found ineffective (\u2265250 \u03bcM) versus L1210/TK \u2212 , which confirms its expected dependence on TK for phosphorylation for eventual biological activity. To the contrary, its phosphorodiamidates 16-18 showed antiproliferative activity versus all the cancer cell lines in a range between 8.9 and 47 \u03bcM for L1210, 73-96 \u03bcM for CEM, 96-116 \u03bcM for HeLa, 30-133 \u03bcM for Colo-320, while being poorly effective versus Caco-2 cell (135-241 \u03bcM). More importantly, all the compounds showed retention of activity against all the TK \u2212 strains in a range between 7.4 and 25 \u03bcM versus L1210-TK \u2212 , 37-54 \u03bcM vs CEM-TK \u2212 , and 29-53 \u03bcM vs HeLa/TK \u2212 strains. These results are strongly suggestive for the successful delivery of d4T monophosphate inside the cells, thus heading to their independence from TK activation. As an alternative hypothesis, it could have been assumed that the similar antiproliferative activity observed for the d4T prodrugs against the L1210 TK \u2212 cells versus wild-type L1210 cells could have been due to a direct effect of the prodrug or prodrug moieties such as the released benzyl part of the molecule. However, this is highly unlikely because in such a case, these prodrugs would have expected to display similar toxicities for the different prodrug molecules (i.e. 16, 22, 24, 25) and this had not been the case.\n\nA similar trend was observed for 3TC (5) and its phosphorodiamidate 25; in fact while the parent nucleoside was found inactive versus all the cancer cell lines (>250 \u03bcM) compound 25 showed a certain antiproliferative activity in a range between 38 and 116 \u03bcM, against all tested tumor cell lines including the TK \u2212 mutant strains. As expected, the phosphorotetramidate 22 and the N-phosphorodiamidate 23 did not show any activity of particular interest.\n\nIn the case of ddA (3) and ABC (11) and their prodrugs, while the parent nucleosides did not show any potent antiproliferative activity (>250 \u03bcM vs L1210, CEM, and HeLa for ddA, >250 \u03bcM vs L1210 and CEM, and 170 \u03bcM vs HeLa for ABC), their prodrugs showed a great enhancement of the activity showing IC 50 values in between 35 and 76 \u03bcM for the ddA derivative 19, and in the range of 19-54 \u03bcM for ABC phosphate prodrugs 34 and 35. Neither AICA (13) nor its prodrugs 38, 39 and 40 showed any activity, which may indicate a poor conversion of these prodrugs into the free monophosphate as it will be discussed.\n\nOne of the advantages of the monophosphate prodrug approach is the by-pass of the first phosphorylation step mediated by human and/or viral kinase enzymes. The monophosphate prodrugs here reported were tested for their antiviral activity versus different viruses. (2), ddA (3), AZT (4), 3TC (5), ACV(10), and ABC (11) , and their respective phosphorodiamidates were tested against HIV-1 and HIV-2 in CEM or MT4 cells (Table 2 ). Compounds 16-18 showed a boost of their activity of ~2-4 fold vs HIV-1 and ~2-6 fold vs HIV-2 compared to their parent derivative d4T.\n\nIn the case of ddA a markedly greater boost in activity (72\u00d7 vs HIV-1 and 57\u00d7 vs HIV-2) was observed for its prodrug 19. AZT derivatives 20 and 21 were equipotent to the parent, while 3TC derivatives were significantly less effective, with the exception of Nphosphorodiamidate 23, which was surprisingly only two fold less active. In the case of ABC, compounds 34 and 35 showed an increased potency (15-41 fold) compared to the parent nucleoside.\n\nIn the case of ACV, a great improvement of its biological profile was observed. In fact, while ACV is not able to inhibit HIV-1 (EC 50 > 250 \u03bcM), both phosphorodiamidates 32 and 33 showed an inhibitory activity in the low micromolar range (2-4 \u03bcM), thus leading to a >60 fold boost in activity.\n\nThe positive results obtained may be due to a combination of both successful delivery of the monophosphate form of the parent nucleosides inside the cells as well as to an enhanced cellular uptake due to an increased lipophilicity. However, these positive features of the monophosphate prodrugs also led, in some cases, to a slightly increased cytotoxicity compared to the parent compounds. In the case of 3TC phosphoramidate 25, the poor anti-HIV activity may be due to a poor metabolic bioactivation of the phosphate prodrug moieties with the subsequent poor release of the free monophosphate form. In fact, the uptake and metabolic activation of the prodrugs is a multistep process for which it is currently not clear which enzymes are contributing to the eventual activity of the prodrugs.\n\nNot only the different type of enzymes involved in the drug conversion pathways have yet to be clarified but also their differential specificities related to the nature of the nucleoside and the prodrug part and their activity levels in the different cell systems are not exactly known. Without any doubt, such subtle differences are playing a role in the eventual biological activity and properties of these compounds.\n\nThe phosphorodiamidate approach prodrug applied to 6-Oalkyl-2\u2032-C-methylguanosine showed outstanding results versus HCV both in vitro and in vivo [12] . Driven by these encouraging results, a series of diamidates of compounds of interests versus HCV were prepared, including 6-O-ethyl-2\u2032-deoxy-2\u2032-\u03b1-fluoro-2\u2032-\u03b2-Cmethylguanosine (1), 4\u2032-AzU (7), 4\u2032-AzC (8), RBV (9) , and ACV (10) ( Table 3) . Unfortunately, the majority of the compounds showed a poor biological profile, with the exception of compounds 14 and 15 derived from compound 1. In fact, both compounds showed an inhibitory activity against HCV in the sub-micromolar range showing a great boost of activity compared to the parent guanosine nucleoside (EC 90 = 69.2 \u03bcM) [25] . Notably, the L-alanine derivative 14 gave a 4 fold improved activity compared to 15, which bears the non-natural amino acid D-alanine. Based on previous study, this finding may be the result of a lower conversion of the D-alanine based phosphate prodrug to the monophosphate, as a consequence of its lower affinity with the enzymes involved in the bioactivation pathway.\n\nAnti-HSV-1 and 2 activity: AICA (13), ACV (10), Cf1743 (12) and their diamidates were then evaluated against human herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 and 2 and feline herpes virus as reported in Table 4. AICA (13) , Cf1743 (12) , and their respective phosphorodiamidate prodrugs 36, 38-40 were devoided of activity against human and feline herpes viruses (EC 50 > 100 \u03bcM) ( Table 4 ). In the case of ACV, while the parent itself showed a submicromolar activity versus HSV-1 and 2, prodrugs 32 and 33 showed a loss (80-200 fold) of antiviral activity. However, when tested against HSV-1 TK \u2212 , while ACV was 100 fold less effective (EC 50 = 23 \u03bcM), its diamidates retained their activity and were found to be equipotent to the parent compound thus indicating their TK independence. Indeed, since ACV obligatorily needs to be converted (activated) to its monophosphate derivative by HSV-1-encoded TK, it has markedly lowered antiviral activity against a HSV-1 TK \u2212 strain whereas its prodrugs have not. It has been ascertained that the prodrugs have no direct activity against purified herpetic DNA polymerase, excluding the possibility that the prodrugs might have activity as such against HSV-1 replication.\n\nSome of the phosphorodiamidate prodrugs were also examined for their inhibitory activity against a variety of other viruses, including vaccinia virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, influenza virus A (H1N1 and H3N2) and B, feline corona virus (FIPV), parainfluenza-3 virus, reovirus-1, Sindbis virus, Coxsackie virus B4, Punta Toro virus, respiratory syncytial virus and Coxsackie virus. None of them showed inhibitory activity nor cytotoxicity at 100 \u03bcM.\n\nAs depicted in Scheme 1, the putative bioactivation pathway for the phosphorodiamidate phosphate moiety involves two enzymatic steps, mediated by an esterase or carboxypeptidase type enzyme (first step) and a phosphoramidase type enzyme (last step). We have reported the investigation of the first step of the bioactivation pathway for both ProTide [26] and diamidate [12] by incubating the desired compound with carboypeptidase Y enzyme in d 6 -acetone and Trizma buffer (pH = 7.6) and following the progress of the process through 31 P NMR. All the prodrugs tested, proved to be chemically robust in d 6acetone and Trizma buffer (pH = 7.6) environment and in absence of carboxypeptidase Y. Figs. 2 and 3 report the first enzymatic cleavage for an ACV prodrug 32 (active compound) and for an AICA prodrug 40 (inactive compound) respectively. Compound 32 (\u03b4 P = 13.66) showed a fast metabolism to the first intermediate lacking one ester moiety. The cleavage of only one ester was supported by the presence of two peaks at the 31 P NMR (\u03b4 P = 14.30 and 14.42), thus indicating the chirality at the phosphorus. After 30 min from the addition of the enzyme a new peak (\u03b4 P = 7.16) appeared, which corresponds to the metabolite lacking one amino acid and one ester, in agreement with our previously published results [11, 26] . Notably, compound 32 was fully converted in 7.5 h into its metabolite indicating that the first step in the bioactivation pathway proceeds well for ACV derivative. To the contrary, a poor metabolism was observed for compound 40. In fact, under the same conditions used for compound 32, only a partial conversion into the desired metabolite (\u03b4 P = 6.71) was observed and after 24 h the starting material (\u03b4 P = 14.20) was still the predominant species.\n\nFrom the two examples reported here, we can correlate the biological activity found for 32 and 40 and their bioactivation efficiency, thus supporting the need of an ester cleavage in the bioactivation pathway for this class of compounds. However intracellular activation of these prodrugs still needs to be confirmed.\n\nIn conclusion, we report the synthesis and biological evaluation of twenty-five phosphorodiamidate prodrugs of known NAs. The key advantage of this nucleoside monophosphate prodrug approach is to overcome the chirality at the phosphorus center present in other monophosphate prodrug approaches, thus allowing the formation of single stereoisomers instead of diastereoisomeric mixtures. A broad anticancer and antiviral evaluation has been performed. Many of the compounds showed a good improvement and/or extension of their biological profile. A great improvement of activity was observed in the case of ddA, ABC and ACV phosphorodiamidates against HIV-1 and 2, while d4T prodrugs showed a good inhibitory activity versus different cancer cell lines. To the contrary, AICA derivatives showed neither anticancer nor antiviral activity. A metabolic assays using carboxypeptidase Y was performed to support the importance of bioactivation of these compounds to exert their activity. In fact, when the compounds were slowly activated in our assays either a low or no activity was observed in the testing, whereas a rapid bioactivation resulted in an improved biological profile. The phosphorodiamidate approach we report shows considerable promise across the biological spectrum where NAs are active and we believe significantly augment the field of nucleotide prodrugs for use in drug discovery.\n\nAll anhydrous solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and amino acid esters from Novabiochem.
