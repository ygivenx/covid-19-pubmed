Some machine learning algorithms, such as gradient boosting, bin missing 169 data as a separate node in the decision tree (Friedman, 2002, Fig. S1 ), however other algorithms 170 such as SVM are less flexible. In order to compare predictive performance across models, 171 missing data can either be imputed or removed from the dataset. Although providing specific 172 advice on whether to include missing data or not is outside the scope of this paper (see 173 Nakagawa & Freckleton, 2008), we provide an option if imputation is suitable for the study 174 problem. We integrated the 'missForest' (Stekhoven & B\u00fchlmann, 2012 ) machine-learning 175 imputation routine (using the RF algorithm) into our pipeline, as it has been found to have low The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

We incorporated an internal repeated 10-fold cross-validation (CV) process to estimate model 199 performance. CV can help prevent overfitting and artificial inflation of accuracy due to use of the The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Another advantage of this package is that it 208 can perform classification or regression using 237 different types of models from generalized 209 linear models (GLMs such as logistic regression) to complex machine learning and Bayesian 210 models using a standardized approach (see Kuhn, 2008 for a complete list of models).\n\nIn our pipeline, we compare supervised machine learning algorithms (RF, SVM, and GBM) as 212 well as logistic regression. These models are among the most popular and best tested machine 213 learning methods, but all operate in different ways, and this can in turn can impact predictive For both CDV and parvovirus, machine learning models had higher predictive performance 316 (higher AUC) compared to logistic regression models (Table 1) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/569012 doi: bioRxiv preprint Using our calibration approach further improved the overall predictive performance of each 320 pathogen by increasing the sensitivity of the models (i.e., they more able to correctly identify 321 positives), however, there was a trade-off with reduced specificity. For example, our calibrated 322 CDV model had a 7% increase in AUC with an 23% increase in sensitivity but 18% decrease in 323 specificity compared to the uncalibrated model ( The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/569012 doi: bioRxiv preprint Age and rainfall were the most important features predicting CDV exposure, but both features 338 were relatively less important in the calibrated models (Fig. 3) . Even though the features 339 associated with exposure risk in each model were broadly similar for both pathogens, the 340 relationships between each feature and exposure risk varied. Partial dependency plots showed 341 that risk of CDV increased relatively linearly across age classes in in the uncalibrated model 342 (Fig. 3b) , whereas in the calibrated model exposure risk was much more constant across age 343 classes with an increase in risk in individuals between 1-2 y.o. (Fig. 3f) . Rainfall also showed 344 different relationships in each model with reduced exposure risk when the average monthly 345 rainfall > 40 mm in the age calibrated model (Fig. 3c) . There was a much shallower decline in 346 CDV risk associated with rainfall in the calibrated model (Fig 3e) compared to the uncalibrated 347 model (Fig. 3c) .

Parvovirus exposure risk 363 slightly increased across age classes in the uncalibrated models, however in the calibrated 364 models exposure risk increased rapidly at early ages (0-1), but then was relatively constant 365 across ages >3 (Fig. S4b) . The signature of rainfall on parvovirus risk in the uncalibrated model 366 was remarkably like that of CDV with a large drop in risk when the monthly rainfall was > 40 367 mm a month (Fig. S4c) . However, rainfall was much less important in the calibrated model ( Fig.   368 S4d). Strikingly epidemic year was important in the calibrated model with exposure risk much 369 higher for animals likely exposed in the 1992 epidemic (Fig. S4f) . We further interrogated the calibrated models to visualize how interactions between features 374 could be important for exposure risk of both pathogens. We focussed on interactions with 375 epidemic year, as we were interested to see if exposure risk could vary with each outbreak (see 376 Fig. S5 for a summary of all interactions detected). For CDV, the strongest interaction with 377 epidemic year was age exposed (Fig. 4a) . Even though exposure risk was predicted to be 378 reasonably similar in each CDV outbreak (Fig. S6) "}
