{"title": "Structural analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and prediction of the human interactome 2 3", "body": "SARS-CoV-2 shares similarities with other beta-coronavirus such as severe acute 49 respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus 50 (MERS-CoV) 3 . Bats have been identified as the primary host for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 4,5 51 but the intermediate host linking SARS-CoV-2 to humans is still unknown. 52\n\nThe coronaviruses use species-specific regions to mediate the entry in the host cell and SARS-CoV, 54 MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the spike S protein activates the infection in human respiratory 55 epithelial cells 6 . Spike S is assembled as a trimer and contains around 1,300 amino acids within 56 each unit 7 . In the S' region of the protein, the receptor binding domain (RBD), which contains 57 around 300 amino acids, mediates the binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme, (ACE2) 58 attacking respiratory cells. Another region upstream of the RBD, present in MERS-CoV but not in 59 of specific elements in the spike S region, which provide clues on the evolution of domains 69 involved in the binding to ACE2 and sialic acid. 70 71 As highly structured regions of RNA molecules have strong propensity to form stable contacts with 72 proteins 16 and promote assembly of complexes 17,18 , SARS-CoV-2 domains containing large 73 amount of double-stranded content are expected to establish specific interactions in host cells. To 74 investigate the interactions with human proteins, we employed catRAPID 12, 13 . catRAPID 14 75 estimates the binding potential or protein and RNA molecules through van der Waals, hydrogen 76 bonding and secondary structure propensities of allowing identification of interaction partners with 77 high confidence 15 . Our analysis revealed that the 5' of SARS-CoV-2 has strong propensity to 78 attract human proteins, especially those associated with viral infection, among which we found a 79 group linked to HIV infection. Intriguingly, a previous study reported similarities of viral proteins 80 in SARS-CoV and HIV-1 19 . In HIV and SARS-CoV-2, but not SARS-CoV nor MERS-CoV, a 81 furin-cleavage site occurs in the spike S protein 20 . This unique feature could explain the spread 82 velocity of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. 83\n\nWe hope that our large-scale calculations of structural properties and binding partners of SARS-85\n\nCoV-2 can be useful to identify the mechanisms of virus interactions with the human host. 86 1) 22 . In addition to the maximum corresponding to nucleotides 23000-24000, the structural content 102 of spike S protein shows minima at around nucleotides 20500 and 24500 (Fig. 1) . 103 We used the Vienna method 23 to further investigate the RNA secondary structure of specific 104 regions identified with CROSS 11 . Employing a 100 nucleotide window centered around CROSS 105 maxima and minima, we found good match between CROSS scores and Vienna free energies (Fig.  106   1) . Strong agreement is also observed between CROSS and Vienna positional entropy, indicating 107 that regions with the highest structural content have also the lowest structural diversity. 108 109 Our analysis suggests presence of structural elements in SARS-CoV-2 that have evolved to interact 110 with specific human proteins 9 . Our observation is based on the assumption that structured regions 111 have an intrinsic propensity to recruit proteins 16 , which is supported by the fact that structured 112 transcripts act as scaffolds for protein assembly 17, 18 . In this analysis, we compared the Wuhan strain MN908947 with around 2800 other coronaviruses 122 (data from NCBI) having as host human (Fig. 2) or other species (Sup. Fig. 1) . When comparing 123 SARS-CoV-2 with human coronaviruses (1387 strains, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), we 124 found that the most conserved region falls inside the spike S genomic locus (Fig. 2) Using Clustal W for multiple sequence alignments 24 , we observed general conservation of the 145 coding regions with several minima in correspondence to areas between genes (Fig. 3A) . One 146 highly conserved region is between nucleotides 23000 and 24000 in the spike S genomic locus, 147 while sequences up-and down-stream are variable (Fig. 3A) . We then used CROSSalign 11 to 148 compare the structural content. High variability of structure is observed for both the 5' and 3' and 149\n\nfor nucleotides between 21000 and 22000 as well as 24000 and 25000, associated with the S region 150 (red bars in Fig. 3A) . The rest of the regions are significantly conserved at a structural level (p-151 value < 0.0001; Fisher's test). 152\n\nWe then compared protein sequences coded by the spike S genomic locus (NCBI reference 154 QHD43416) and found that both the sequence (Fig. 3A) and structure (Fig. 2) of nucleotides 23000 155 and 24000 are highly conserved. The region corresponds to amino acids 330-500 that contact the 156 host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 25 provoking lung injury 26,27 . By contrast, 157 the region upstream of the binding site receptor ACE2 and located in correspondence to the 158 minimum of the structural profile at around nucleotides 22500-23000 ( Fig. 1) is highly variable 159 ( Fig. 3A) . This part of the spike S region corresponds to amino acids 243-302 that in MERS-CoV 160 bind to sialic acids regulating infection through cell-cell membrane fusion ( Our analysis suggests that the structural region between nucleotides 23000 and 24000 of Spike S 165 region is conserved among coronaviruses (Fig. 2) and the binding site for ACE2 has poor variation 166 in human SARS-CoV-2 strains (Fig. 3B) . By contrast, the region upstream, potentially involved in 167 adhesion to sialic acids, has almost poor structural content and varies significantly in the human 168 population (Fig. 3B) . 169 author/funder.

Following a 175 protocol to study structural conservation in viruses 11 , we divided the Wuhan sequence in 30 176 fragments of 1000 nucleotides moving from the 5' to 3' and calculated the protein-RNA 177 interactions of each fragment with the human proteome using catRAPID omics (105000 178 interactions, consisting of around 3500 protein candidates for each of the 30 fragments) 12 . For each 179 fragment, we identified the most significant interactions by filtering according to the Z interaction 180 propensity. We used three different thresholds in ascending order of stringency: Z greater or equal 181 than 1.50, 1.75 and 2 respectively. Importantly, we removed from the list proteins that were 182 predicted to interact promiscuously with different fragments. Table 1 ). Considering the three thresholds applied 193 (Materials and Methods), we found 22 viral proteins for fragment 1, 2 proteins for fragment 2 and 194 proteins and were included because they could have potential RNA-binding ability (Fig. 5) 33 . As 204 for fragment 2, we found two viral proteins: TRIM32 (Q13049) and TRIM21 (P19474), which are 205 listed as negative regulators of viral release from host cell, negative regulators of viral transcription 206 and positive regulators of viral entry into host cells. Finally, for fragment 29, 10 of the 11 viral 207 proteins found are members of the endogenous retrovirus group K Gag polyprotein family, that 208 perform different tasks during virus assembly, budding, maturation (Sup. Table 1) . 209 210 Analysis of functional annotations carried out with GeneMania 34 reveals that proteins interacting 211 with the 5' of SARS-CoV-2 RNA are associated with regulatory pathways involving NOTCH2, 212 MYC and MAX that have been previously connected to viral infection processes (Fig. 5) 35, 36 . 213\n\nInterestingly, some of the proteins, including CCNT1, DDX1, ZNF175 for fragment 1 and TRIM32 214 for fragment 2, are reported to be necessary for HIV functions and replications inside the cells. We found that the spike S protein domain encompassing amino acids 330-500 is highly conserved 237 across SARS-CoV-2 strains. This result suggests that spike S has evolved to specifically interact 238 author/funder. All rights reserved.

As the 239 nucleic acids encoding for this region are enriched in double-stranded content, we speculate that the 240 structure might attract host regulatory proteins, which further constrains its variability. The fact that 241 the ACE2 receptor binding site is conserved among the SARS-CoV-2 strains suggests that a 242 specific drug can be designed to prevent host interaction and thus infection, which could work for a 243 large number of coronaviruses. Using catRAPID 12, 13 we predicted that the highly structured region at the 5' binds is the region 257 with largest number or protein partners, including DDX1, which has been previously reported to be 258 essential for HIV-1 and coronavirus IBV 39,40 , the non-canonical RNA-binding proteins CCNT1 37,38 259 and ZNF175 41 involved in polymerase II recruitment. Connections to regulatory pathways 260 involving NOTCH2, MYC and MAX have also been identified. 261\n\nWe hope that our analysis would be useful to the scientific community to identify the interactions to 263 block SARS-CoV-2 spreading. 264 265 author/funder.
