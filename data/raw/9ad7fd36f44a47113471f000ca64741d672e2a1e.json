{"title": "PROPERTIES OF A CORONAVIRUS ISOLATED FROM A COW WITH EPIZOOTIC DIARRHEA", "body": "Bovine coronaviruses causing neonatal calf diarrhea have been isolated in the U.S.A. (Stair et al., 1972; Doughri et al., 1976) and in England and Denmark (Bridger et ah, 1978b) . The presence of the virus has also been reported in Belgium on the basis of a serological survey (Zygraich et al., 1975) and by immunofluorescence (Wellemans et al., 1977a, b) , and in Canada by electron microscopic and immunofluorescence observations (Acres et al., 1975; Morin et al., 1976) . In contrast to the condition in calves, the etiological agents of diarrhea in adult cattle have been reported in New Zealand (Homer et al., 1976; Durham et al., 1979) , and recently Takahashi et al. (1980) isolated a coronavirus-like agent associated with epizootic diarrhea in a cow in Japan.\n\nThis report deals with the physicoChemical characteristics of the Japanese isolate, the identification of the virus as a member of the coronavirus family, and an investigation of a possible serological relationship between this virus and the American strain of calf diarrhea coronavirus.\n\nBEK-1 cells were propagated in a growth medium consisting of 80% Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM), 10% tryptose phosphate broth (TPB) and 10% fetal bovine serum. Maintenance medium (MM) used was MEM containing 10% TPB, 0.05% yeast extract, 0.5% sodium glutamate and 0.1% glucose. Added to each medium were 100 I.U. penicillin/ ml, 100 pg streptomycin/ml, 60 gg kanamycin/ml and 1 pg fungizone/ml.\n\nThe Kakegawa isolate (Takahashi et al., 1980) was used at the ninth or tenth passage level in primary bovine kidney cells. The American strain of calf diarrhea coronavirus that had been passag.ed in cell cultures of fetal bovine kidney was supplied by Dr. C.A. Mebtis, University of Nebraska, NE, U.S.A. This virus was passaged 11 or 12 times in BEK-1 cells before it was used.\n\nThe C-121E strain of bovine enterovirus (BEV) (Kurogl et al., 1976) , and the Los Angeles strain of bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1) (Madin et al., 1956) were used as reference viruses.\n\nSerial ten-fold dilutions of viral material were made in MM and each was inoculated in 0.1 ml amounts into three tubes of BEK-1 cells. After the virus had been adsorbed to cells at 37\u00b0C for 90 min, 0.5 ml of MM was added. The infected cells were incubated in a roller drum at 37\u00b0C for 7 days and the infectivity titer expressed as TCIDs0/0.1 ml was calculated.\n\nNucleic acid type was determined by the use of 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine (IUDR). Virus diluted to contain 1,000 TCIDs0/0.1 ml was inoculated into BEK-1 cells and adsorbed at 37\u00b0C for 90 min. After washing the infected monolayers three times with MEM, to one half of each set of cultures was added 0.5-ml amounts of MM containing 50 ~g IUDR/ml. To the other half serving as controls, 0.5 ml of MM was added. All the cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C. At daily intervals, four cultures were taken from each group, and the infective fluids were pooled after low-speed centrifugation. Infectivity titers were determined by the method mentioned above. As reference viruses, BEV and BHV-1 were also tested.\n\nTo determine the ether sensitivity of the virus, 1.6 ml of each virus suspension was mixed with 0.4 ml of anesthetic ether. The mixture was vigorously shaken, left to stand at room temperature for 5 rain, and then centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 5 min, and the water phase assayed immediately for infectivity. For treatment with chloroform, 1.9 ml of each virus suspension was mixed with 0.1 ml of chloroform. The mixture was treated in the manner mentioned above, and the resulting water phase was assayed for infectivity.\n\nVirus suspensions were diluted ten-fold in McIlvaine's buffer solution and adjusted to pH 3.0, 5.0 or 7.0. Controls were diluted with PBS (pH 7.2). Thereafter, incubation was carried out at room temperature for 1 h.\n\nVirus suspensions were incubated in a water bath at 50, 60, 70 or 80\u00b0C for 1 h. Others were kept in a water bath at 50\u00b0C for 5, 10, 15, 30, 60 or 180 min.\n\nVirus suspensions were mixed with an equal volume of 2 M MgC12 solution, MM and distilled water. The mixtures were incubated in a water bath at 50\u00b0C for 1 h.\n\nDoubling dilutions of trypsin (Sigma Type III) ranging from 2 to 0.125% were prepared in PBS. One milliliter of the virus suspension was mixed with an equal volume of each trypsin dilution and the mixtures placed in a water bath at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. To each was then added 2 ml of trypsin inhibitor (Sigma Type 1-S).\n\nVirus suspensions were filtered through a series of Sartorius' membrane filters of 200, 100 and 50 nm pore size.\n\nInfective culture fluid, from which cell debris had been removed by lowspeed centrifugation, was centrifuged at 100,000 g for 2 h and the resultant pellets were suspended in one-hundredth of the original volume of PBS. The suspension was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 g for 20 min and layered on top of a 5--60% (w/w) su~crose linear gradient to be centrifuged again using a SW 40 Ti rotor (Beckman, California, U.S.A.) at 100,000 g for 2 h. The gradient was then fractionated by a density gradient fractionator (ISCO, Nebraska, U.S.A.). Each of the fractions obtained was assayed for infectivity and hemagglutinin activity.\n\nA drop of the peak fraction with a density of 1.182 was placed on a carbon collodion-coated grid and stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid adjusted to pH 6.7 with 1 N NaOH. The specimen was examined by a JEM-100CX electron microscope (Jeol Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).\n\nAntigen for hyperimmunizing guinea-pigs was prepared as follows. Infective culture fluids were concentrated by ultra-centrifugation. The resulting suspensions were mixed with a CsC1 solution to a density of 1.25 and centrifuged at 100,000 g for 20 h. Fractions showing the highest hemagglutinin titer were collected. Four guinea-pigs were injected intramuscularly with 1 ml of a mixture of equal parts of antigen and complete Freund's adjuvant. They were bled at 2-week intervals after three injections.\n\nEach serum dilution was mixed with an equal volume of virus dilution containing 200 TCIDs0, and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. Each mixture was then assayed for infectivity by using two tubes per serum dilution. The tests were read after incubation at 37\u00b0C for 7 days. The antibody titer was expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that showed no cytopathic changes in at least one of the two tubes.\n\nThe HA and HI tests were carried out by the methods described by Sato et al. (1977b) .\n\nCytopathic changes were first observed 2--3 days after inoculation. They were characterized initially by granulation and syncytial formation of BEK-1 cells. These changes were followed by cellular degeneration and sloughing of the cells from the glass wall ( Figs. 1 and 2) . \n\nThe influence of IUDR upon the experimental results is illustrated in Fig. 3 . The Kakegawa isolate multiplied in the presence of IUDR, as did the American strain, and it was therefore assumed to be an RNA type virus. BEV was not affected by IUDR, but BHV-1 was prevented from growing in the presence of IUDR, as expected.\n\nThe Kakegawa isolate and the American strain were inactivated completely within 5 min treatment with ether and chloroform (Table I) .\n\nBoth viruses decreased slightly in titer by 0.8 and 0.7 logs, respectively, when placed at pH 3.0, but were scarcely affected at pH 5.0 and 7.0 ( Table   II) .\n\nThe Kakegawa isolate passed a membrane filter of 200 nm pore size, but was retained by one of 100 nm pore size. The American strain, however, passed a membrane filter of 100 nm pore size (Table II) .\n\nAlthough the American strain was completely inactivated by heating at 70\u00b0C, the Kakegawa isolate retained infectivity at this temperature. However when heated at 50\u00b0C, both viruses showed a gradual loss of infectivity, over a period of 3 h, and it is presumed therefore that both viruses are moderately sensitive to heat {Tables III and IV). Both viruses were stabilized with 1 M MgC12 (Table V) , and were sensitive to high concentrations of trypsin (Table VI) .\n\nBuoyant density determination of the Kakegawa isolate was performed in a sucrose linear density gradient. The peak of infectivity and hemagglutinin activity was located in fraction 12 with a buoyant density of 1.182 (Fig. 4) . Electron microscopy of this material revealed numerous spherical virions of 120 nm average diameter. They were pleomorphic and had widely spaced petal-shaped surface projections about 20 nm in length (Fig. 5) . \n\nThe results of cross NT and HI tests with guinea-pig hyperimmune sera are shown in Table VII . These indicate that there is a close antigenic relationship between the Kakegawa isolate and the American strain.\n\nIsolation of bovine coronaviruses in tissue culture is difficult (Woode et al., 1978) and only the American strain develops cytopathic changes in fetal bovine kidney cells (Mebus et al., 1973) and BEK-1 cells . Other isolates propagated in cell culture (Bridget et al., 1978b) and organ culture (Stott et al., 1977; Bridger et al., 1978a) , are non-cytopathic.\n\nIn the present study, the Kakegawa isolate was readily propagated in BEK-I cells. Cytopathic changes appeared within 2--3 days after virus inoculation and resembled those obtained in BEK-1 cells infected with the American strain of coronavirus . It is presumed, therefore, that BEK-1 cells are preferable to primary bovine kidney cells for the propagation of this virus.\n\nBecause multiplication of the virus was not affected by the action of IUDR, this indicates that its nucleic acid is RNA. The presence of an envelope, containing structural lipids in the virus can be presumed from its sensitivity to ether and chloroform, and this suggestion was supported by electronmicroscopic observation. These basic properties are in common with those of the American strain of calf diarrhea coronavirus (Sharpee et al., 1976) and other members of the coronaviridae (McIntosh, 1974) .\n\nThe isolated virus was almost completely inactivated by heating at 50\u00b0C for 3 h and was considered to be moderately sensitive to heat. It also showed increased stability against heat inactivation in the presence of I M MgCI2. These findings are in agreement with those previously reported by other workers (Sharpee et al., 1976; Sato et al., 1977a) . In contrast it should be noted that the thermostability of bluecomb coronavirus of turkeys is decreased in the presence of I M MgCl2 (Deshmukh and Pomeroy, 1974) , and that no effect of MgC12 occurs on the thermostability of human coronavirus 229-E (Hierholzer, 1976) . Sato et ai. (1977a) reported that the American strain decreased slightly in infectivity at pH 3.0, while the same strain was found to be resistant to acid by Sharpee et al. (1976) . Although the virus isolated by the present authors revealed a slight loss of infectivity at pH 3.0, it was considered to be acid stable.\n\nIt was also affected by a high concentration of trypsin to a similar degree as the American strain, although Sato et al. (1977a) reported that the American strain was inactivated completely when treated with a concentration of 5% or higher of trypsin. These conflicting results may be due to differences in viral titers and/or the type of trypsin used.\n\nThe buoyant density of the virus was estimated at 1.182 in sucrose gradient which is in agreement with the previous results obtained with the American strain (Sharpee et al., 1976) and some other coronaviruses (McIntosh, 1974; Pensaert and Callebaut, 1978) .\n\nThere was an antigenic similarity in the NT and HI tests between the Kakegawa isolate obtained from a cow and the American strain of calf diarrhea coronavirus. This suggests that bovine coronavirus may be of a single serotype which is capable of causing diarrhea in a wide age-range of cattle, regardless of the age of the animal.\n\nFurther detailed studies will be necessary to compare the pathogenicity of the Kakegawa isolate with that of calf diarrhea coronaviruses, and its antigenicity with that of coronaviruses from cattle and other species."}
