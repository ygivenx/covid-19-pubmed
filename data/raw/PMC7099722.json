{"title": "Antimicrobial Therapy in Childhood Asthma and Wheezing", "body": "Asthma has traditionally been defined on clinical grounds as a respiratory disease characterized by recurrent and reversible airway obstruction with wheezing, cough, and dyspnea. In recent years, our understanding of asthma has expanded, and the special impact of airway inflammation and, in severe cases, of airway remodeling on pathogenesis has led to a new definition which describes asthma as a chronic inflammatory process in which a number of cells and cellular events are involved[1,2] (reviewed by Yang[3]).\n\nRepeated measurements of FEV1 (a general index of airway resistance) and PEF (which measures large airway resistance, which accounts for 80% of total resistance) have gained a global consensus to guide therapeutic interventions in patients >5 years of age. Bronchial hyperreactivity is defined as a 20% decrease in FEV1 at \u22648 mg/mL methacholine challenge or >15% increase in FEV1 after the administration of albuterol (salbutamol) in patients with baseline airflow obstruction (FEV1 <70%) in whom a methacholine challenge cannot be performed.\n\nPatients with asthma also exhibit elevated levels of fractionated exhaled nitric oxide, which can be utilized as a marker of airway inflammation. The measurement of fractionated exhaled nitric oxide has been shown to enhance the diagnosis of asthma, detect deterioration in the control of asthma, and monitor response to anti-inflammatory therapy, as levels decrease after inhaled corticosteroid treatment,[4] especially in individuals with asthma and atopy.[5] The measurement of fractionated exhaled nitric oxide may become an important tool in clinical practice.[6] Furthermore, an increase in the sputum-associated immune cell (in particular eosinophil) count should be taken into account during diagnosis, since it is believed to reflect underlying airway inflammation.[7\u20139] The eosinophil count can also be used to predict asthma control after the discontinuation of inhaled corticosteroids.[9]\n\nParticularly in infants and young children, some important differential diagnoses have to be excluded before recurrent wheezing is attributed to bronchial hyperreactivity and asthma. In children who did not receive the full set of vaccinations in their first year of life, whooping cough should always be excluded and droplet precautions should be implemented as long as the results of B ordetella pertussis diagnostics are pending.\n\nAn aspirated foreign body may cause recurrent episodes of pulmonary infection. This makes it reasonable not only to confirm the clinical diagnosis of pneumonia with chest x-ray in hospitalized children, but also to control for the complete resolution of pulmonary infiltrates after 4\u20136 weeks. Cystic fibrosis should also be excluded (sweat test) in any child with severe recurrent respiratory tract infection.\n\nThe medical history of the patient may reveal prematurity and prolonged ventilator (supplemental oxygen) therapy with subsequent bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (nocturnal attacks of wheezing and cough) may trigger recurrent wheezing and respiratory infections due to microaspirations. Sinusitis as a cause of posterior drainage-associated chronic cough should be considered in school age children with asthma symptoms.[17] Chronic persistent infection of the airways with atypical bacteria such as Mycoplasma spp. or Chlamydophila spp. may cause recurrent wheezing episodes;[18\u201320] beyond simple acute exacerbation, some recent lines of evidence suggest that infection with these atypical bacteria may play an additional role in the pathogenesis of asthma.[21]\n\nAs a result of continuous research, the number of potential risk factors (e.g. tobacco smoke, house dust mite, mould, pet or cockroach allergens, and genetic background of atopy) for the development of asthma is increasing (reviewed by Arruda et al.).[22]\n\nBreastfeeding or, alternatively, the use of a documented hypoallergenic formula for at least 4\u20136 months seems to be protective.[23] This effect may be explained by the observation that maternal intake of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG during late pregnancy followed by administration of L. rhamnosus GG to the infant for the first 6 months of life significantly decreased the proportion of children with atopic eczema in the verum group.[24] Thus, gut microflora might be a hitherto unexplored source of natural immunomodulators and probiotics for prevention of atopic disease.[24,25] However, any protective effect of frequent early exposure to (potential) pathogens and infections on the prevalence of asthma has been questioned in further studies.[26,27] Thereby, only one prospective trial[28] fosters the hypothesis that antibacterial treatment in infancy is related to a higher risk of asthma later in life.[29,30]\n\nNevertheless, too many wheezing episodes in infants triggered by viral infection are treated with antibacterials, although the risk of bacterial superinfection is in general <5% (influenza excluded).[31\u201333] This misuse of antibacterials may have biased studies that evaluated antibacterial treatment in early infancy as a risk factor for subsequent asthma.[29] However, it should be noted that in contrast to this misuse, the sophisticated use of antibacterials, in particular macrolides, may downregulate prolonged inflammation, increase mucus clearance, prevent biofilm formation, and also decrease the bacterial virulence (reviewed by Shinkai and Rubin).[34]\n\nThe diagnostics of viral respiratory tract infections relies on different methods and, in general, depends on the skills and experiences of a virological laboratory.\n\nFortunately, some of the viruses causing respiratory infections can be cultivated in permissive cell cultures, provided that the necessary equipment and technology are available. However, as the culture method is sometimes time-consuming and the viruses may be extremely difficult to recover, e.g. in the case of hCoV-NL63 and HMPV,[42\u201344,60] other more rapid diagnostic methods like reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or antigen detection assays are preferred in clinical practice. Antigen detection by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method is available for RSV, IV, PIV and ADV and provides a positive or negative result between 15 minutes and 3\u20136 hours. However, until such assays are developed for routine use for newly detected pathogens like HMPV or hCoV NL-63,[43] the method of choice is to detect the viral nucleic acid. Thus, PCR or RT-PCR plays a crucial role in the detection of newly detected viral respiratory pathogens. For most of these agents, however, it is still unknown how long the PCR remains positive in respiratory specimens after the cessation of the clinical illness.\n\nBesides the high sensitivity of the RT-PCR/PCR, this method is advantageous in detecting additional infection by another virus, commonly described as co-infection. However, as the viral RNA may take 5\u20136 weeks to disappear from nasal mucus, e.g. after the onset of symptomatic respiratory infection by rhinoviruses,[61] it may not be clear which of the viruses detected is responsible for the clinical symptoms. Therefore, the duration of detection should be investigated, to avoid false positive PCR results, weeks or possibly months after the first infection.\n\nA series of very detailed investigations of the clinical, laboratory, and radiologic presentations of community-acquired pneumonia in children under the age of 5 years revealed that no combination of clinical signs, host acute phase response markers at any cut-off value, or radiologic findings reliably differentiates between bacterial and viral or between atypical and typical pneumonia in this age group.[72,87\u201389] Thus, microbiologic diagnostic efforts are indispensable to identify the responsible respiratory pathogen.\n\nInitially, C. pneumoniae was designated as TWAR strain of C. psittaci,[90] but differences in DNA sequences, epidemiology, and also pathogenicity led to the actual classification of this pathogen. Furthermore, there is a high prevalence of IgG antibodies against C. pneumoniae in the general population (>50% in adults).[90] Thus, the laboratory diagnosis, in general, is based on serologic testing.\n\nAs a result of a consensus conference held at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA, Dowell and colleagues[91] concluded that acute infection with C. pneumoniae is accompanied by the appearance of IgM antibodies that can be detected 2\u20133 weeks after the onset of clinical symptoms. Thereafter, IgM antibodies are detectable up to 2\u20136 months and are replaced by low titers of IgG antibodies that firstly appear 6\u20138 weeks after infection. Dowell and colleagues concluded that the use of a single parameter will not lead to a complete diagnosis and that PCR, although not yet standardized, will be of increasing importance as a future tool for diagnosis. Furthermore, they stated that \u2018there are no wholly satisfactory serological methods for diagnosis of C. pneumoniae infection.\u2018[91]\n\nThe PCR method for pathogen detection is of increasing importance for the second atypical bacterial pathogen related to asthma, M. pneumoniae. However, the major obstacle to the use of PCR as the single method for the detection of M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae is that it does not distinguish between viable and nonviable bacteria, for example after antibacterial chemotherapy.[92] Thus, at least one other method is recommended for the laboratory diagnosis of both infections.\n\nThe most frequently used method to detect specific antibodies in the majority of studies that investigated an association between asthma and C. pneumoniae infection is the microimmunofluorescence test.[64,91] Alternative serological assays have been described, but the lack of commercial availability and limited specificity (cross-reactive antibodies) have impeded their broader use in practice.[91,92]\n\nThe laboratory diagnosis of M. pneumoniae is more complex and even more difficult. Although M. pneumoniae can be cultivated on solid media, its growth is extremely slow (\u22656 days), and the culturing methods are extremely insensitive. Thus, it is difficult to get a rapid diagnostic result with this method. However, M. pneumoniae can be isolated from swabs, retronasal aspirates, sputum, or BAL. In all cases where the subsequent culturing of the pathogen is required or desired, the specimen should be solved (i.e. material should be mixed with medium) in adequate transportation media. For rapid detection, the material can be investigated with enzyme immunoassays, oligonucleotide hybridization methods, or PCR assays.\n\nWhile culturing on solid-phase media, middle-sized granulated colonies without the typical \u2018fried egg\u2019 appearance are formed. For orientation, M. pneumoniae can be identified via glucose cleavage reactions, hemadsorption, and hemolysis, and finally the identification procedure can be finished by a growth inhibition test and/or epifluorescence. Because of the insensitive culturing method and the difficulties of other methods, in addition to the direct or indirect detection of M. pneumoniae, serologic testing can and should be performed. Traditionally, such serologic detection of a M. pneumoniae infection was performed by complement fixation. This assay has the general limitations that it is: (i) impossible to differentiate antibody subclasses; (ii) lacks specificity; and thus, (iii) cannot differentiate between acute, chronic, or previous infections.[64] Meanwhile, the commonly used serologic test that replaced complement fixation is the ELISA method, which has the major advantage that there some assays commercially available and these tests specifically differentiate between different stages of the infection.[64]\n\nAll in all, the diagnosis of atypical respiratory tract infection is still laborious, sophisticated, expensive, and time consuming. There is an urgent need for sensitive, specific, standardized, and economically inexpensive diagnostic tests that can be used at the bedside or at least yield results within 2\u20136 hours.[18] Only if the pathogen can be easily identified and its detection can be definitely attributed to infection (vs colonization) will it be possible to confirm its role in the inception of the chronic inflammatory process; prospective randomized studies on the best therapeutic intervention can then be performed.[69] Modern multiplex PCR approaches detect an extended spectrum of pathogens in parallel, thereby reducing costs for material and personnel. Although this approach is intriguing, the \u2018reality check\u2019 of some published methods often yields much lower detection rates than expected. This problem will probably be overcome by the recent \u2018upgrade\u2019 of these multiplex assays as described by Khanna et al.[93] These authors developed the Pneumoplex\u00ae assays that combine multiplex PCR and hybridization assays while being highly specific and highly sensitive.\n\nAlmost 50 years after the first description of RSV, physicians attending children with viral respiratory tract disease and asthma are still awaiting the development of effective and economically inexpensive medications for the prevention and treatment of respiratory viral infections in infants.[45] For the majority of respiratory viruses there is no specific therapy available to impede infection or to inhibit viral replication in the infected host. In most cases, treatment is symptomatic with no specific intervention fighting the pathogen. In contrast to bronchiolitis in hospitalized infants and children without a history of asthma or recurrent wheezing,[31,94] the early administration of systemic corticosteroids represents the primary means of treatment in severe asthma exacerbations,[3,16] irrespective of any acute infection (the only exception is a varicella zoster virus infection in which systemic corticosteroids should only be given under systemic aciclovir coverage).\n\nThe neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir are active against influenza viruses and are available for the treatment of microbiologically confirmed influenza.[95] These substances inhibit the enzymatic activity of neuraminidase and are thought to prevent the release of newly budded progeny virions from the cell surface. The neuraminidase inhibitors have to be used very early (within the first 72 hours) during the course of the disease, or even as a chemoprophylaxis. Thus, a rapid laboratory diagnostic test that detects the viral RNA or the viral antigen is mandatory to guide decisions on treatment.\n\nAnother possibility to prevent influenza-triggered asthma is to prevent the infection by vaccination. Although this possibility is highly desirable, the major disadvantage is that vaccination targets actual influenza strains. In epidemic seasons, when new strains emerge (as most recently observed for the avian influenza virus H5N1), a new specific vaccine must be developed and, in general, is available only in the middle of the ongoing epidemic or for the next epidemic season. However, we strongly recommend vaccination of any high-risk group, especially those with an increased risk of asthma. In the near future, newer vaccine formulations and live, attenuated influenza vaccine strains[96\u201399] may complement current vaccination strategies.\n\nA specific passive immunoprophylaxis and also a nonspecific antiviral therapy are available to prevent or treat infections with human RSV. The first option is immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody binding to the highly conserved F protein of both RSV-A and RSV-B subtypes.[32] The efficacy of palivizumab (mainly a significant reduction of the percentage of children who have to be rehospitalized with RSV infection in the first 24 months of life) was tested in two well-designed, prospectively randomized, double-blind multicenter studies.[100] However, the prophylactic use of this antibody is limited due to its high cost; thus, its application is recommended only for high-risk premature infants, for infants with hemodynamically relevant congenital heart disease,[46] and (not at the same level of evidence) in RSV-infected patients after allogenic blood stem cell transplantation.[101,102]\nAntiviral therapy for RSV infections is possible and sometimes successful with ribavirin, administered by the inhalation of aerosols from a small-particle aerosol generator. This therapy may be an option in the case of life-threatening RSV infections in mechanically ventilated premature infants or in severely immunocompromised children. In the latter group, ribavirin has been suggested as a treatment option in patients with severe influenza or parainfluenza virus infection.[102] Even in those high-risk populations, its routine use is controversial due to a lack of evidence of a significant benefit in randomized controlled studies, as well as cost issues, and potential toxicity (and teratogenicity) in both patients and exposed caregivers.[103] One study of ribavirin use in infants with severe bronchiolitis, observed a long-term benefit on subsequent airway hyperreagibility.[104] Even if this could be confirmed in further controlled trials, no valid clinical or laboratory parameter indicates which subgroup of patients will experience such a positive outcome.As reviewed by Weinberger,[52] a number of compounds are known to display only marginal cytotoxic effects while being highly active against RSV in inoculated tissue culture. Three compounds are already being tested in phase I or phase II trials: pleconaril, RSV 604 (A 60444), and RF I641.[52,105] However, neither ribavirin nor any of the new therapeutic agents active against RSV have been assessed or licensed for use in children with recurrent wheezing or asthma.[52]\n\n\nThe respiratory viruses most frequently detected in school-age children with asthma are the rhinoviruses. While no specific treatment against rhinoviruses is available yet, an increasing number of promising drug candidates are under development or even in the early phase of clinical trials. One of these drugs that has successfully passed a phase II clinical trial is rupintrivir,[106] a selective irreversible inhibitor of the rhinoviral 3C-protease which is administered intranasally. It is a peptidomimetic compound with poor aqueous solubility and low oral bioavailability in animals,[107] but it was well tolerated in healthy adult volunteers.[108] Pleconaril may be another future option for the treatment of rhinovirus infections as it inhibits the attachment of virus to host cell receptors and the uncoating of viral nucleic acid.[109] Pleconaril can be applied orally and is distributed to the upper and lower airways after enteral absorption. Infection with rhinoviruses, however, has not been a major inclusion criterion in clinical studies of pleconaril.[110]\n\nICAM-1 is an important cellular receptor for the attachment of rhinoviruses. There have been experimental approaches to inhibit the virus-receptor interaction by monoclonal antibodies or antagonistic molecules. One antibody-like compound CFY 196 is a recombinant antibody fusion protein and may be a promising candidate for further investigations and clinical trials. Another compound, sICAM-1 (tremacamra), consists of an ICAM-1 derivate in which the transmembrane and intracellular domains have been truncated.\n\nSpecific therapies or vaccinations are lacking for human metapneumovirus and respiratory coronaviruses. Furthermore, data on experimental usage of antivirals in vitro that should inhibit the replication of these viruses are ambivalent and not very promising, and even the development of specific vaccines has not yet been as successful as expected.\n\nFor human metapneumovirus, as for the other \u2018untreatable\u2019 viral pathogens, prospective controlled studies are needed to confirm or refute the efficacy of any therapeutic intervention in infants and children with recurrent wheezing, asthma, bronchiolitis, or pneumonia. It should be proven in prospectively randomized double-blind studies with sufficient power that a certain therapeutic intervention has a positive impact on illness severity (breath rate and oxygen saturation), length of inpatient care, and the necessity to admit the patient to the intensive care unit or to start mechanical ventilation. It is also important to identify evidence-based treatment methods to avoid the unjustified consumption of financial resources. In this context, systemic treatment with corticosteroids[31,111,112] or inhalation treatment with beta mimetics or adrenaline (epinephrine)[31,111,112] should be investigated critically. For example, in epidemiologic studies published up till 2005, 26\u201344% of all HMPV-infected hospitalized pediatric patients received systemic corticosteroids, and half of them were treated with bronchodilators. Due to the increasing number of clinically relevant viral respiratory pathogens and also the increasing number of newly developed antiviral drugs, the absolute prerequisite for a specific treatment remains a rapid and specific diagnostic approach.\n\nSpecific therapy options for viral infections are summarized in table I.\n\nTreatment with erythromycin and, to a lesser, but still considerable extent, clarithromycin may result in clinically relevant, potentially toxic interactions with drugs that are (as the two macrolides) metabolized via hepatic cytochrome P450 microsomal enzymes.[129] Most relevant in patients with asthma is the profound elevation of theophylline plasma levels and the enhanced cardiotoxicity of antihistamines like terfenadine (prolonged QT interval, increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias, and torsade des pointes). Azithromycin does not interact with these enzymes and may be combined without subsequent problems, e.g. for example with cyclosporin after stem cell or organ transplantation.[134]\n\nNo controlled trials are available on the optimal duration of treatment in childhood atypical bacterial tracheobronchitis or pneumonia. Considering the observation of persistent colonization after conventional treatment regimens, in particular in C. pneumoniae infections,[79,80,116] it seems reasonable to use a prolonged treatment schedule in children with asthma and confirmed atypical bacteria infection, as suggested by Esposito et al.[113] for azithromycin (i.e. 10 mg/kg/day for 3 days per week in 3 consecutive weeks). Alternatively, the use of clarithromycin for at least 14\u201321 days may be considered.[90] Further well designed, randomized and controlled trials are clearly needed to examine the effectiveness of different antibiotics against M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae and the optimal dose and duration of therapy in various patient populations.[135]\n\nAlthough the number of pathogens suspected to be associated with acute or chronic asthma pathogenesis in childhood is increasing, the number of options for specific therapies available now or in the near future is also increasing. Thus, before starting a therapy it is strongly recommended that clinicians perform a rapid clinical and laboratory diagnosis accompanied by a detailed history. Thereafter, a specific and individual therapy regimen should be considered in order to avoid the development of resistance and to minimize drug-specific adverse effects or unnecessary drug interactions. In this manner, treatment may avoid acute and/or chronic asthma in the affected patient."}
