The milligrams of yeast tRNA (type x, Sigma) was added to major candidate protein involved in these processes is each sample and then RNA was eluted from the gel as the large surface protein S. We decided as a first step described previously (Langridge et al., 1980; toward the production of recombinant viruses to study al., 1984). For hybridization, RNA samples were sepawhether recombinant genomic RNA could be generated rated in formaldehyde-agarose gels (Sambrook et al., from coreplication of MHV-A59 and a DI RNA containing 1989). The gels were dried and hybridized with 5-endthe RI S gene. The S gene sequences of MHV-A59 and labeled oligonucleotide probes (Meinkoth and Wahl, MHV-RI are highly homologous, but have an important 1984).

We decided to take advantage of this difference by using Reverse transcription and PCR amplification (RT-PCR)\n\nit as a marker to detect recombinant MHV-A59 genomes. The oligonucleotides used for this study are listed in Table 1 . Three specific RT-PCRs were developed for the Strategy for cDNA cloning detection of DPRIS, MHV-A59, and recombinants.

These two fragments were subsequently combined to yield formed for 35 cycles, each consisting of 1 min at 94\u040a, 1 min at 49\u040a and 2 min at 72\u040a.

From our combined data, we concluded that DPRIS could be replicated and packaged efficiently in the presence of helper virus MHV-A59. The lower accumulation of DPRIS-4YL was not further investigated: we decided to continue our experiments with DPRIS-1L only, as it replicated most efficiently.\n\nWe attempted to detect recombinant genomic RNA in the intracellular RNA from cells coinfected with DPRIS and MHV-A59 and in progeny virions. For this purpose, a specific RT-PCR protocol was developed for the detec- in the DPRIS RNA.

The results for was done on these two pDPRIS constructs. Both pDPRIS-P2 and P4 RNAs showed that intracellular and virion 4YL and -1L encode a 190-kDa protein (data not shown).\n\nRNAs from pDPRIS transfected, MHV-A59 infected cells yielded PCR products of the expected size ( . 5 ). pMIDI was used as a control throughout this experiment.

Intracellu-is an MHV-RI S gene-specific probe, and therefore only hybridizes to DPRIS (data not shown). The results lar MHV-A59 RNA was used as a negative control. Genomic MHV RNA was purified from the gel and subjected showed that DI DPRIS-4YL, -1L, and MIDI RNAs were replicated in the presence of MHV-A59 (Fig. 2) . When to the recombinant-specific RT-PCR. C188, which binds to a region located 200 nt upstream of the extra sequence 048 was used for hybridization, an extra fragment of approximately 1 kb was found in the DPRIS lane. This RNA and is specific for the RI S gene, was used for RT, and C188 along with C143 for PCR (see Fig. 5 ). A 1.2-kb PCR represents a DI subgenomic RNA produced from the intergenic region between the S and ORF4a genes that product is expected for this recombinant-specific RT-PCR. Again, we were able to demonstrate the presence was included in the fragment that was cloned from (Fig. 4A) . spike gene were most likely generated from homologous recombination between the DI RNA and MHV-A59 geno-Significantly, the DI particle DPRIS RNA could not be detected by a DI-specific RT-PCR (Fig. 4B) , whereas mic RNA. To check whether we could detect recombinants from more downstream sites of the spike gene, MHV-A59 genomic RNA was detected by a A59-specific RT-PCR (Fig. 4C ). This indicated that the RNA template we designed an additional series of MHV-RI S-specific antisense primers, comprising C189, C190, C191, and was free from DI RNA, excluding again the possibility of RT or PCR polymerase jumping between templates.\n\nC192 (Table 1 and Fig. 5) , all containing at least a 2-nt mismatch with the A59 sequence at the 3 end. These Thus, the genomic RNAs containing the chimeric A59/RI primers were used for PCR on the P2 and P4 intracellular RNA samples in which the presence of recombinant RNAs was confirmed by the recombinant-specific RT-PCR shown above (C142 for RT and C143 and C147 for PCR). C142 was used for the reverse transcription and C143 in combination with each of the antisense primers, including C188 as positive control, was used for PCR. Only the primer pair C143/C188 resulted in the amplification of a specific fragment (data not shown). This indicates that the double MHV polymerase jump occurred between nt 277 and the position of primer C189, which is nt 1883.\n\nTo find the location of the crossover sites in the recombinants, 11 plasmids of cloned recombinant-specific 1.65-kb RT-PCR products, 7 from P4 intracellular 1L RNA, and 4 from P4 virion 1L RNA were sequenced. The sequence analysis of these clones showed that they were all different, except clones 8v (virion) and 11i (intracellu- which is negative in RT-PCR). Crossover sites can only be determined as regions between marker mutations, but as can be seen in Fig. 6 in several cases this is only two nucleotides (clones 3v, 8v/11i, and 10v). The crossovers do not reveal any obvious role for RNA primary or secondary structure in recombination.\n\nWe are interested in the role of the spike protein in the determination of tissue tropism of MHV strains. Our approach is to attempt to convert the respiratory tropism of MHV-A59 into an enteric tropism by exchanging parts of the S gene of the respiratory strain MHV-A59 with Table 1 ); the dotted lines show their binding sites. The black bars represent the MHV-RI S sequence, the white bars the MHV-A59 sequence. The intermediate diagram represents the 5-crossover sites of 11 recombinants. The 3-crossover sites are not determined, but do not extend beyond the position op primer C189. The gap region in MHV-A59 S is indicated. corresponding parts of the genome of the enterotropic We show first that after cloning a 3.9-kb fragment of the MHV-RI S gene cDNA into the MIDI derivative, MIDI-strain MHV-RI and study the properties of the recombinant virus.\n\nDPst*, the resulting DI construct DPRIS RNA could be replicated and passaged efficiently in MHV-A59-infected For smaller RNA viruses such as alphaviruses and picornaviruses mutagenesis of their genomes is possible cells. The spike gene in DPRIS is discontinuously fused to the terminal sequences from the MHV genome re-because full-length infectious cDNA clones have been constructed. This has profoundly advanced the study of quired for replication of the DI RNA. Therefore, double homologous recombination events are required for the viral replication and pathogenesis (Hahn et al., 1989a; 1989b; Lustig et al., 1988; Kohara et al., 1985;  La Monica introduction of a mutation into the genomic A59 S gene. It is generally accepted that RNA recombination in coro-et al., 1986; Omata et al., 1986; Pincus et al., 1986) . However, for MHV, the extreme length of the genome poses naviruses occurs by a copy-choice mechanism in which the polymerase jumps between templates, as was first an obvious technical problem. The only possibility to mutagenize site-specifically the MHV genome is currently proposed by Kirkegaard and Baltimore (1986) . Thus to mutate the genomic S gene, first an homologous jump by using homologous RNA recombination and several successful attempts have been reported (Koetzner et al., from the genomic RNA template to the synthetic DI RNA template must occur and then jumping back again to the 1992; Masters et al., 1994; Van der Most et al., 1992) .\n\nThe most efficient approach uses DI particles as the genomic RNA, either during negative or positive strand RNA synthesis. We show in this report that in the ab-source of donor RNA (Masters et al., 1994; Van der Most et al., 1992) . The advantage of a replicating DI is that the sence of positive selection pressure, recombination between DPRIS and the MHV genomic RNA could be de-amount of DI RNA increases during replication and, more importantly, during passaging, which increases the tected, but only by a highly specific and sensitive RT-PCR. This was not surprising, since it has been described chance of recombination between DI RNA and genomic RNA. Some investigators even observed that the in-that less than 10% of the total virus progeny contained a single crossover when copassaging a DI particle with creased rate of recombination between replicating DI RNA and helper virus RNA was high enough to identify a helper virus without selection pressure (Masters et al., 1994) . The frequency of double crossover recombina-recombinants without the necessity for selection directly (Masters et al., 1994) . However, very significantly, the DI tions is expected to be much lower. Recombinant genomic RNA was present in the pool of intracellular RNAs system in all the published reports was limited in that it only allowed the introduction of mutations into the very as shown by specific RT-PCR. More convincingly, recombinant RNA could be detected in purified virions with 3 and 5 end of the MHV genome. The donor RNA contained these terminal sequences of MHV, as they are specific RT-PCR. Finally, MHV genomic RNA purified from DI by using low melting point agarose gel also yielded required for replication, thus only one crossover event was necessary to generate a viable mutant. We decided a recombinant-specific PCR signal. All the data strongly suggest that homologous recombination between syn-to set up a similar protocol, based on replicating DI RNA, to mutagenize internal regions on the MHV genome.\n\nthetic DI RNA and MHV-A59 genomic RNA truly takes place. However, this approach would rely on double crossover events, i.e., from the acceptor genomic RNA to the donor In low passage (P0 and P1) no recombinant-specific RT-PCR products were detected in intracellular and virion DI RNA and back.\n\nFIG. 6.
