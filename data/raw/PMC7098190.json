{"title": "Targeting vesicle size", "body": "One third of deaths from infectious diseases worldwide are of viral origins. Although hundreds of viruses are known to cause human diseases, the mainstay of antiviral research and development remains focused on direct antiviral agents (DAA) that inhibit specific viral proteins of individual viruses. This \u2018one lock, one key\u2019 approach has resulted in two major drawbacks of the current antiviral therapy: narrow spectrum of therapeutic coverage and emergence of drug resistance. These drawbacks are further inflamed by two daunting challenges. First, the development of a new drug is slow and expensive, taking at least ten years at an average cost of over US$2 billion dollars1. Second, the nature of virus emergence is very unpredictable. The one lock, one key approach is impossible to provide a rapid countermeasure when responding to a global crisis of virus emergence, as evidenced during the recent epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), chikungunya, Ebola and Zika viruses. Thus, new antiviral approaches are urgently needed. Writing in Nature Materials, Joshua Jackman and colleagues2 report an antiviral approach, termed lipid envelope antiviral disruption (LEAD), for development of broad-spectrum antiviral therapy. The authors demonstrated that an amphipathic \u03b1-helical peptide (AH-D), derived from the first 27 amino acids of hepatitis C virus (HCV) non-structural protein 5A (NS5A; Fig. 1a), has potent antiviral activities against Zika, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis and chikungunya viruses, with EC50s (a concentration required to inhibit 50% of viral replication; 12\u2013206 nM) and CC50 (a concentration required to cause 50% cytotoxicity; 63 \u03bcM). Remarkably, treatment of Zika virus-infected mice with this peptide, even when starting the therapy on day three post-infection, protected against disease and death without adverse effects.\n\nThe N-terminal region of HCV NS5A is known to associate with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in infected cells. When studying the interaction of the N-terminal \u03b1-helix of this protein with lipid membranes, Cho et al. serendipitously discovered that the AH peptide could potently rupture liposomes3. Importantly, the AH peptide selectively ruptures liposomes with diameters of <160 nm. Such size-dependent liposome disruption is determined by the ability of the AH peptide to sense different degrees of membrane curvature4. Specifically, liposomes of <160 nm have high membrane curvatures that are susceptible to AH peptide-mediated pore formation (Fig. 1b, top); once a critical density of pores is formed, membrane lysis occurs (Fig. 1b, bottom). In contrast, liposomes of >160 nm have low membrane curvatures that are not susceptible to AH peptide-mediated pore formation, thus no lysis occurs5. In agreement with the liposome results, tested viruses prone to AH peptide inhibition fall within the disruptive range of liposome size: flaviviruses, 40\u201360 nm; chikungunya virus, 60\u201370 nm; bunyaviruses, 90\u2013100 nm; and human immunodeficiency virus, 120 nm. In contrast, viruses of larger sizes, such as vaccinia virus, 360 \u00d7 270 \u00d7 250 nm3, as well as cell membranes are less sensitive to the peptide inhibition2,6. These results suggest that the AH peptide may also inhibit other untested enveloped viruses, as long as their virions are <160 nm.\n\nBesides AH peptide, Chisari and colleagues also found that C5A peptide, representing amino acids 3\u201320 of HCV NS5A, has a broad spectrum of antiviral activity7,8. The potency of C5A peptide (EC50s 0.6\u20134.5 \u03bcM against different viruses) is much weaker than the current AH peptide, possibly due to the differences in peptide lengths and amino acid sequences. Indeed, mutagenesis analysis showed that the amphipathic \u03b1-helical structure as well as the amino acid composition are critical for the peptide\u2019s antiviral activity7. Since chirality is not essential for antiviral activity, the current AH-D peptide was synthesized with D-amino acids rather than L-amino acids that are more susceptible to proteolytic degradation9. The D-chirality improves the peptide\u2019s pharmacokinetic stability to a half-life time of 7 h in mice. In addition, the AH-D peptide can cross blood\u2013brain barrier2. This brain-penetrating property is ideal for potential treatment of neurotrophic viruses. Indeed, the improved potency, pharmacokinetics and brain-penetrating property of the AH-D peptide have translated into excellent efficacy in vivo. Treatment of Zika virus-infected mice with AH-D peptide reduced viral loads in blood and organs, as well as reduction in inflammatory cytokines, weight loss and deaths (Fig. 2). Specifically, treatment with AH-D peptide decreased the death rate from 100% to 17%. The peptide\u2019s ability to access the brain significantly enhanced its antiviral activity in the central nervous system and protected the brain function of infected mice, as indicated by a normal level of myeloperoxidase2.\n\nTargeting host factors essential for virus life cycle is a valid antiviral approach. This approach has led to the development of maraviroc, a clinically approved HIV drug that inhibits host protein CCR5, a co-receptor for HIV entry10. Compared with direct antiviral agents, host-targeting antiviral approach offers the advantage of higher barriers for resistance emergence, since viral mutations are less able to compensate for loss of essential host cofactors. In addition, because different viruses share common host factors/pathways for viral replication, compounds targeting the shared host factors/pathways could have broad antiviral activities. For further development of the AH-D peptide, understanding the structure of how the peptide senses and disrupts the virions will help design future inhibitors. The ability to optimize and shorten the peptide, while keeping its potency, will reduce the drug cost. Most importantly, achieving no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in preclinical safety tests will advance the AH-D peptide to clinical trials. Overall, the current study represents a breakthrough in advancing the LEAD concept as a new class of broad-spectrum antiviral therapy."}
