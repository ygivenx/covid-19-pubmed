SG assembly is 94 mediated by the RNA binding proteins T-cell antigen 1 (TIA-1), TIA-1 related protein 95 (TIAR) and the Ras-GAP SH3-binding protein 1 (G3BP1), and results in the 96 compartmentalization of translationally-stalled mRNA transcripts, RNA-binding proteins, 97 40S ribosomes, and translation initiation factors [10, 11] . SG are considered to be sites of 98 mRNA triage, protecting mRNA transcripts until a stress is alleviated and the cell returns 99 to homeostasis. 100\n\nMany viruses prevent activation of the integrated stress response to maintain 101 protein translation and to ensure successful viral infection. To do this, viruses target the 102 initiating kinases and/or the downstream effector mechanisms of the ISR. Cells in which 103 the initiating kinases, such as PKR are inhibited or knocked out are often more 104\n\npermissive for viral replication [12, 13] . However, not all viruses benefit from inhibition 105 of kinase activity and initiation of the ISR. A study examining the role of the PKR-eIF2 106 pathway during mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus) infection found some strains had 107 reduced titers in PKR knockout murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) [14] . Follow-up 108 studies observed both increased ISR gene expression and reduced levels of the eIF2\u03b1 109 kinase inhibitor P58 IPK in cells infected with reovirus strains known to robustly interfere 110 with host translation, and these strains replicated less efficiently in MEFs expressing a 111 non-phosphorylatable form of eIF2\u03b1 [15] . 112 infection, the stress granules have disappeared and viral factories (VFs), the sites of 116 prototype reovirus serotype 3 strain Abney (T3A) was a kind gift from Dr. Barbary 162 Sherry (North Carolina State University) and was plaque-purified and passaged twice on 163 L-cell monolayers to generate working stocks. 164 165 Infections. CV-1, L929, HeLa or HPDE cells were seeded in 24-well culture plates 166 containing 12 mm glass coverslips or 12-well culture plates the day before to give rise to 167 50 to 80% confluence prior to infection. Cells were infected with virus at the indicated 168 MOI for 1 h at room temperature (RT) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4), 169\n\nsupplemented with 2 mM MgCl 2 , with rocking every 10 min. Following absorption, virus 170 was removed and cells were incubated in growth medium at 37\u00b0C and harvested at the conflicting as to the timing of stress granule presence in infected cells [15, 16] . To 230 evaluate this further, we first confirmed that stress granules could form in CV-1 cells by 231 treating uninfected cells with 0.5 mM sodium arsenite for 30 min. We then fixed and co-232 immunostained for TIAR and G3BP, two RNA binding proteins required for stress 233 granule formation. We saw stress granules in ~91% of treated CV-1 cells, confirming that 234 these cells can form stress granules ( Figure 1A , upper panels). We next infected CV-1 235 cells with reovirus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 and fixed and 236 immunostained cells at the indicated times post-infection (p.i.) for the presence of stress 237 granules (TIAR), and viral factories (\u00b5NS) ( Figure 1A , lower panels). Stress granules 238\n\nwere absent in mock-infected cells and began appearing in infected cells around 2 h p.i. 239\n\nWe found that stress granule formation in reovirus-infected CV-1 cells peaked around 6 h 240 p.i. with 6.6% of cells containing stress granules. By 8 h p.i. the percentage of infected 241 cells containing stress granules had dropped to 3.1% and by 18 h p.i., the level was no 242 different from mock-infected cells ( Figures 1A-B) . A previous report showed that stress 243 granules were present in reovirus-infected human prostate carcinoma DU145 cells at 19.5 244 h post infection [15] . Although we did not see stress granules in CV-1 cells at late times 245 post-infection with reovirus at an MOI = 1, we found that G3BP and TIAR co-localized 246 at the periphery of viral factories at 24 h p.i. when cells were treated with 0.5 mM sodium 247 arsenite for 30 min immediately prior to harvest ( Figure 1C) . We occasionally saw a 248 similar phenotype at 24 h p.i. in infected cells not treated with sodium arsenite ( we observed only a modest increase in the expression level of stress granule protein 253 All rights reserved.

Together, these data suggest that reovirus infection induces stress granules at early, To explore this, we first examined the effect of stress granule presence on viral protein 267 expression. CV-1 cells were either left untreated (-), or were treated with 0.5 mM sodium 268 arsenite for 30 min before infection at an MOI = 1 (pre) or 30 min before harvest (post). 269\n\nCell lysates were collected at 0, 6, 10, 18 and 24 h p.i. and the expression level of the 270 non-structural viral protein \u00b5NS was determined (\u00b5NS was first detectable by 10 h p.i.). 271\n\nAt 10, 18 and 24 h p.i., the expression levels of \u00b5NS were consistently higher in cells pre-272 treated with sodium arsenite when compared to untreated cells or cells treated with 273 sodium arsenite 30 min before harvest ( Figure 2A) . 274\n\nAs the viral protein \u00b5NS is necessary for formation of viral factories during 275 reovirus infection, we next explored if the elevated \u00b5NS expression was a consequence of 276 All rights reserved.

We found 277 that in cells pre-treated with 0.5 mM sodium arsenite for 30 min prior to reovirus 278 infection, 67% of cells were infected (contained viral factories) at 18 h p.i., whereas only 279 33% of untreated cells were infected at 18 h p.i. (Figures 2B and C) . We found similar 280 findings at 24 h p.i. ( Figure 2C ). 281\n\nGiven the increased percentage of infected cells in dishes pre-treated with sodium 282 arsenite, we tested if pre-treatment of cells with 0.5 mM sodium arsenite for 30 min 283 before reovirus infection enhanced viral yield. We found that pre-treatment with sodium 284 arsenite led to a modest but significant 2-3 fold increase in viral titer (PFU/ml) that was 285 independent of multiplicity of infection, but consistent with the increased numbers of 286 infected cells and the increased protein expression ( Figure 2D ). Together, these data 287 indicate that pre-treatment of cells with sodium arsenite enhances reovirus infectivity by 288 increasing the numbers of virus-permissive cells. 289 290\n\nhave suggested that reovirus-induced stress granule formation is cell-type specific [15, 292 16] . Therefore, we next sought to determine if the replication enhancement observed in 293 CV-1 cells was seen in other cell types. We assessed the effect of pre-treatment with 0.5 294 mM sodium arsenite on CV-1, HeLa, L929 murine fibroblasts, and human pancreatic 295 ductal epithelial (HPDE) cells on viral infectivity. In each cell line, a relative multiplicity 296 of infection was chosen such that 20-50% of cells were infected. Consistent with our 297 observations in CV-1 cells, pre-treatment with sodium arsenite in L929 and HPDE cells 298 resulted in a higher percentage of cells exhibiting viral factories than untreated cells 299 All rights reserved.

However, sodium arsenite pre-treatment did not increase the number of 300 infected HeLa cells ( Figure 3A ). These data indicate that activation of the stress response 301 pathways prior to infection through pre-treatment with sodium arsenite is beneficial in 302 some, but not all, cell types. 303\n\nreovirus strains Type 1 Lang (T1L), Type 2 Jones (T2J), Type 3 Abney (T3A), and Type 306 3 Dearing (T3D) differ in their capacity to induce host translational shutoff and to induce 307 eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation [15, 26] . To determine if the benefit of pre-treatment with sodium 308 arsenite was reovirus strain specific, we infected CV-1 cells with T3D, T1L or T3A and 309 assessed the percentage of infected cells at 18 h p.i. compared to untreated cells. As 310 observed following infection with the T3D strain, pre-treatment with sodium arsenite 311 resulted in nearly a 2-fold increase in the percentage of T1L-and T3A-infected cells 312 ( Figure 3B ). Sodium arsenite pre-treatment in L929 cells infected with T3D, T1L or T3A 313 yielded similar results, however sodium arsenite pre-treatment had no effect on any strain 314 tested in HeLa cells (Supplemental Figure 1) . These data suggest that reovirus strains 315 T3D, T3A and T1L benefit from pre-treatment with sodium arsenite prior to infection in 316 some cell types. 317 318 Heat shock prior to infection enhances viral protein expression in T3D-infected L-319\n\nstress-responsive kinases, sodium arsenite treatment activates HRI kinase.

HRI is the only stress kinase required 324 for translational inhibition in response to arsenite treatment in mouse embryonic 325 fibroblasts [27] . HRI kinase can also be activated by other cellular stresses including 326 osmotic stress and heat shock. To further assess if the enhanced reovirus infectivity 327 following sodium arsenite treatment was a consequence of HRI activation, we assessed 328 viral protein expression, the percentage of infected cells and viral yield in response to 329 heat shock. We used stress granule induction in response to heat shock as an indirect 330 measure of HRI activation ( Figure 4A ). Our attempts to induce stress granules in CV-1 331 cells with heat shock were only able to achieve no greater than 25% of cells containing 332 stress granules. Because of this, we assessed the effects of heat shock induction of stress 333 granules in L929 cells. Heat shock for 45 minutes at 44\u00b0C resulted in ~88% of L cells 334 containing stress granules ( Figure 4A ). Similar to our observations in CV-1 cells pre-335 treated with sodium arsenite, viral protein expression was enhanced at 10 and 18 h p.i. in 336 L cells exposed to a 45 min heat shock prior to infection ( Figure 4B ). However, heat 337 shock activation had no impact on the percentage of infected cells or viral yield in L cells 338 ( Figures 4C-E) . These findings suggest that in L-cells, heat shock enhances protein 339 expression, but does not affect either the numbers of infected cells or the per cell yield of 340 virus. Although heat shock activates HRI kinase, its effect on cells differs from sodium 341 arsenite. Together, these data indicate that sodium arsenite pre-treatment perturbs the cell 342 in a way that is beneficial for reovirus compared to other activators of the HRI kinase. 343 344 All rights reserved.

We found that the enhancement of viral protein synthesis in cells pre-treated with 347 sodium arsenite treatment was not evident if cells were treated immediately prior to 348 harvest at 10, 18, or 24 h p.i. (Figure 2A) . Given that viral protein expression, but not the 349 percentage of infected cells or viral yield, was enhanced by activation of the HRI kinase 350 using heat shock in L cells, we hypothesized that sodium arsenite treatment might in cells following infection with reovirus strains that induce host shut-off [15] .

We, therefore, hypothesized that reovirus 371 may be capable of viral protein synthesis in the face of enhanced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. 372\n\nWe reasoned that inhibition of GADD34/PPI dephosphorylation would enhance 373\n\nphosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, but should have no effect on viral protein synthesis. We used a 374 selective inhibitor of GADD34, salubrinal, which prevents the activity of the 375 GADD34/PPI complex without affecting the kinases that phosphorylate eIF2\u03b1 [29] . 376\n\nImmediately following adsorption of reovirus, CV-1 cells were treated with increasing 377 amounts of salubrinal and cells were harvested at 18 h p.i. to determine viral protein 378 expression ( Figure 6A ). Even at high concentrations, salubrinal had no impact on viral 379 protein expression, suggesting that reovirus tolerates the cellular antiviral activity of 380 eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. Given that sodium arsenite is a known inducer of eIF2\u03b1 381 phosphorylation, we also tested the impact of adding salubrinal following reovirus 382 adsorption to sodium-arsenite pre-treated cells ( Figure 6A ). Again, we observed no 383 negative impact on viral protein expression when cells were pre-treated with sodium 384 arsenite prior to infection and then incubated in the presence of salubrinal for the duration 385 of infection ( Figure 6A ). Consistent with this, the percentage of virus infected cells was 386 unaffected by the addition of 50 mM salubrinal either in cells left untreated or cells pre-387 treated with 0.5 mM sodium arsenite ( Figures 6B-C) . Together, these data suggest that 388 sustained eIF2\u03b1-phosphorylation resulting from salubrinal treatment during reovirus 389 infection is not anti-viral. 390 All rights reserved.

SA treatment induces the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 395 within cells. The increased intracellular ROS in turn lead to activation of HRI, which then 396 phosphorylates eIF2\u03b1 at serine residues 48 and 51 leading to general translation 397 repression and downstream activation of the integrated stress response. In order to mature 398 and become activated, HRI has to be in a complex with CDC37, PPP5C, and HSP90. In 399 addition to being activated by heme-deficiency, HRI is also activated by heat shock and 400 osmotic shock, but not by ER stress or by amino acid or serum starvation [7] . In contrast, 401\n\nto the enhanced viral replication we saw following pre-treatment with SA, heat shock 402 (HS) pre-treatment did not enhance viral replication. Heat shock also activates HRI, but 403 to a qualitatively lower level than SA and with a different pattern of autophosphorylation 404 of HRI [7] . Why pre-stressing cells with SA, but not with heat shock, benefited viral 405 replication is unclear. It is possible that the kinetics, magnitude and timing of eIF2\u03b1 406 phosphorylation following these different stressors varied leading to the different 407 outcomes we saw. Alternatively, we cannot rule out the possibility that SA treatment 408 activates responses not mediated by HRI that benefit viral replication. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/555367 doi: bioRxiv preprint is likely that different strains of reovirus induce SG to varying extents, and that this is 415 influenced by cell type and MOI, our data using the type 3 Dearing strain suggests that 416 infection with this strain of reovirus results in a low level of SG induction that is absent at 417 late times post infection. The timing of SG appearance (peak at 6 h) and dissolution 418 may in fact have been viral factories that were co-staining for the presence of TIAR [15] . 426\n\nThe significance of SG protein relocalization to VFs remains to be determined. Still, 427 these data imply that reovirus has evolved mechanisms to counter the cellular antiviral 428 activity of translation suppression through stress granule induction. 429\n\nPre-treatment of cells with SA led to enhanced viral protein expression, increased 430 infectivity, and higher viral titers. Given that reovirus compartmentalizes the translational 431 machinery in VF and that components of the translational machinery are also sequestered 432 within SGs, we previously speculated that SGs may serve as a reservoir of translational 433 machinery for reovirus VFs [23] . However, comparison of reovirus infection following 434 pre-treatment with either SA or heat shock (HS) suggests that the benefit is independent 435 of SG formation, as both treatments resulted in a robust induction of SGs, but only SA 436 All rights reserved.

As we only examined viral 437 replication late during infection, it is possible that we missed early differences. 438\n\nAdditionally, since we were unable to achieve robust SG formation following HS in CV-439 1 cells, viral replication studies were performed in L cells. Therefore, we can't rule out 440 cell-specific influences. 441\n\nOur data is consistent with the findings of Smith et al that reovirus benefits from 442 activation of the ISR. In that study, the authors found that reovirus replicated to lower 443 titers in cells lacking a phosphorylatable eIF2\u03b1 [15] . SA is a potent activator of the ISR. that heightened eIF2\u03b1-phosphorylation may more strongly affect mRNAs containing 455 long or highly structured 5\u00b4 untranslated regions (UTRs) [31, 32] . Reovirus mRNAs have 456 short 5\u02b9and 3\u02b9 UTRs, possibly providing protection to viral mRNAs during translation 457 [33, 34] .

Treatment with SA also increases Hsc70/Hsp70 chaperone levels in cells [45] . 479 Furthermore, Hsc70 is required for HRI activation and blockade of Hsc70 disrupts HRI 480 activation [7] .

It is conceivable that SA pre-483 treatment could alter the availability of Hsc70 or other protein folding chaperones in a 484 way that is favorable during reovirus replication. 485\n\nInfection with reovirus results in increased expression of stress response genes 486 including Hsc70, and GADD34, the latter of which complexes with protein phosphatase 1 487 to reverse eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. We observed that Type 3 Dearing (T3D) reovirus 488 protein expression was unaffected in the presence of salubrinal, a selective inhibitor of 489 the GADD34/PP1\u03b1 complex responsible for dephosphorylating eIF2\u03b1, even in cells pre-490 treated with SA to elevate the level of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1. The observation that 491\n\nsalubrinal was not anti-viral to T3D reovirus is not unique. Rotavirus, a fellow member of 492 the Reoviride family, as well as other viruses including hepatitis C virus and mouse 493 hepatitis coronavirus, demonstrate continued viral protein synthesis despite heightened 494 eIF2\u03b1-phosphorylation [47] [48] [49] . While this provides additional evidence that reovirus 495 benefits from the ISR, it is important to note that reovirus-induced expression of stress 496 response genes is not uniform and that host shutoff strains, including C8 and C87 (Type 3 497 Abney, T3A), induce increased expression of these genes compared to T3D, which is not 498 considered a host shutoff strain. While all reovirus strains tested, including T3A, 499 benefited from SA-pre-treatment, host shutoff strains may respond differently from T3D 500 to salubrinal treatment [15] . 501\n\nIn addition to strain-specific differences in the ability to induce host shutoff, cell 502 differences have also been recorded. For instance, reovirus-induced host shutoff was not 503 observed in HeLa cells but was in L cells [30] . This may be linked to our observation that 504 All rights reserved.

Furthermore, HRI kinase activation of the ISR is insufficient for 509 replication enhancement as both heat shock and sodium arsenite activate the HRI kinase, 510 but only sodium arsenite treatment was associated with increased viral infectivity and 511 higher yield. Finally, sodium arsenite-induced enhancement was observed across reovirus 512 strains but was not observed in all cell types suggesting a role for cell-type-specific 513\n\ninfluences. Understanding the interplay between reovirus and the ISR, and how to 514 modulate it to enhance virus replication, could reveal novel targets to strengthen the 515 oncolytic potential of reovirus.
