{"title": "Structural basis for receptor recognition by New World hemorrhagic fever arenaviruses", "body": "Purification of MACV GP1 and human TfR1. (a) MACV GP1 (residues 79-258) with the addition of a His 6 -tag at the C-terminus, was expressed in insect cells and purified by nickel affinity chromatography. The purified protein, when passed over a size exclusion column (Superdex 200, GE Healthcare Life Sciences), elutes as a sharp peak at 17.3 ml (trace shown here). Inset is a SDS-PAGE gel of the protein under reducing conditions. MACV GP1-His 6 appears as a diffuse band because of extensive glycosylation. (b) The soluble ectodomain of hTfR1 (residues 117-760) was expressed in CHO cells and purified by affinity chromatography as previously described 1 List of MACV GP1 residues that contact TfR1, colored as in Figure 4 . The residues found in analogous positions for the recently isolated NW hemorrhagic fever arenavirus Chapare are shown 2 . SABV was included for reference, as Chapare and SABV are closely related (both are clade B3 viruses).\n\nSupplemental Figure 5 Sample of electron density for MACV GP1. The volume, shown in stereoview, is from a 2F o -F c simulated-annealing composite all-omit electron density map, contoured at 1.5 \u03c3, in the region corresponding to MACV GP1 residues 105-112."}
