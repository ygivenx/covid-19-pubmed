{"title": "Supplementary Materials", "body": "Structural characterization of the PRRSV nsp10 ZBD. (A) Structure of the cross-braced zinc finger and (B) treble-clef zinc finger. The residues coordinating the Zn 2+ ions are shown as sticks. (C) Superposition of the ZBD of PRRSV nsp10 (green) and EAV nsp10 (PDB code: 4N0N; grey). (D) Sequence alignment of ZBD of PRRSV nsp10 and EAV nsp10. Multiple sequence alignment was carried out using Clustal Omega [1] . The illustration of sequence alignment was generated using ALINE [2] . Minor manual adjustments were performed in accordance with the superimposition.\n\nPutative protein interaction surface of the nsp10 ZBD. Hydrophobic surface of (A) the PRRSV nsp10 ZBD and (C) the EAV nsp10 ZBD. The hydrophobic pocket is covered by domain 1B in PRRSV nsp10. A 45\u00b0 rotation view is shown in the right panel. Close-up view of hydrophobic pockets of (B) PRRSV nsp10 and (D) EAV nsp10. Domain 1B is omitted for clarity. Hydrophobic residues are shown as sticks. The orientation is the same as in panels A and C. Colors are calculated according to the method (https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/ Color_h). "}
