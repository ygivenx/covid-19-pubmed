{"title": "Non-periodic outbreaks of recurrent epidemics and its network modelling", "body": "Figure 1(a,b) show the weekly consultation rates of influenza-like illness (per 1000 consultations) collected from the sentinel points involving General Practitioners (GP) (Fig. 1(a)) and General Out-Patient Clinics (GOPC) (Fig. 1(b)) under the sentinel surveillance system in Hong Kong44, where the data from 2009/6/13 to 2010/5/23 in (a) was not collected by the Centre. The value of C in (b) is from 0 to 150. These two sets of data are highly correlated, see Fig. 1 in SI. It means that the weekly consultation rates of influenza-like illness can well reflect the overall influenza-like illness activity. However, limited by the records, the data in Fig. 1(a,b) did not distinguish the types of influenza viruses. Fortunately, the Department of Health of Hong Kong made a classification of the influenza viruses in recent years. The Table-I in SI shows the components of influenza viruses in the years from 2010 to 2013, where the tested specimen obtained from GOPCs, GPs, public and private hospitals. From this Table we see that they are mainly concentrated on three kinds of typical viruses, indicating that the influenza data in Fig. 1(a,b) can represent the features of a typical influenza virus.\n\nFrom Fig. 1(a,b) we interestingly find that the peak of the weekly consultation rates of influenza-like illness fails to appear in some years and the intervals between two consecutive peaks are not very regular, in contrast to the regularity of annual outbreaks reported in refs 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41. To make it clear, we select the maximum weekly consultation rates in each year from Fig. 1(a,b) and plot them in Fig. 2(a,b), respectively. From Fig. 2(a,b) one can easily find that the points are not distributed only in the weeks of winter or spring but distributed in most of the 52 weeks of a year, indicating the feature of non-periodicity. Is this a specific phenomenon only in Hong Kong? To figure out the answer, we have checked a large number of other recurrent influenza data and found that such phenomenon also shows up in other cities. Figure 1(c,d) show two such examples of measles infective cases I in New York and Baltimore, respectively. It is easy to see that their outbreaks are also non-periodic, indicating that this non-periodicity is generic in recurrent influenza data. On the other hand, we find that the average of Fig. 1(a,b) over the whole 16 years is an oscillatory behavior but not an unimodal distribution, see Fig. 2 in SI, supporting the feature of non-periodicity again.\n\nEpidemic spreading is usually studied by the classic epidemic models46 such as the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model and the susceptible-infected-refractory (SIR) model. In an isolated SIS model, a susceptible node may be infected by an infected neighbor at rate \u03b2. In the meantime, each infected node will become susceptible again at rate \u03bc at each time step. After the transient process, the system reaches a stationary state with a constant infected density I, i.e. having no decreasing process and thus no oscillatory behavior. Thus, the SIS model cannot be used to describe the recurrent epidemic patterns. Similarly, in an isolated SIR model, a susceptible node may be infected by an infected neighbor at rate \u03b2. At the same time, the infected node will decay into a refractory one with probability \u03bc at each time step. The infection process will be over when there is no infected I, implying that the refractory density R monotonously increases but never drops down. Thus, the SIR model cannot be used to describe the recurrence of influenza data. To successfully reproduce the recurrent outbreaks, ref. 36 considered a specific SIR model with a time-dependent infected rate , i.e. a sinusoidal function of time t, where both the birth rate and mortality rate are included. As the mortality rate will make the refractory R decrease and the birth rate will make the susceptible S increase, thus this SIR model is in fact equivalent to the susceptible-infected-refractory-susceptible (SIRS) model47. This work is significant in revealing the regular outbreak of epidemic, but it fails to explain the non-periodicity observed in Figs 1 and 2.\n\nTo understand the mechanism of the non-periodicity in the recurrent influenza data, we here propose a SIRS model to reproduce the epidemic patterns with non-periodicity. Figure 3 shows its schematic figure. In this model, we have included two characteristic features: one is the time-dependent infected rate  from one year to another, i.e. piecewise constants (see Methods for details), and the other is a small natural infection rate . The former comes from the observation in Table-I in SI that the components of viruses are different from one year to another. It is well known that different viruses have different infection rates. If we use a single infection rate \u03b2 to represent the comprehensive effect of all the components of viruses in one year, the value of \u03b2 will be thus different from one year to another, indicating that \u03b2 depends on time t and can be taken as different constants in different years. This is different from the sinusoidal function in ref. 36. The latter comes from the fact that there is always a small fraction of naturally infected people in our society, which may come from the environment. That is, there is a small probability  to generate infected seeds at each time step, in contrast to the previous models with only initial seeds.\n\nWe let the network be the uncorrelated configuration model (UCM) with a power-law degree distribution , size , and average degree 48, see Methods for details. The dynamics equation of SIRS model is also given in the section of Methods. Numerical simulations of this model show that the recurrent behaviors of non-periodic epidemic patterns can be reproduced only when we take a time-dependent  and a nonzero . Let  represent the average of  and \u03c3 be its standard deviation. Figure 4(a,b) shows the results of constant infection rate with  and  where we have  in (a) and  in (b). Figure 4(c,d) shows the results of time-dependent infection rate with  and  where (c) and (d) represent the cases of  and 0.01, respectively. Comparing Fig. 4(a) with (b) we find that the infected density  cannot be sustained in (a) but can be sustained in (b), indicating that the threshold for the case of constant \u03b2 is in between , i.e. . From Fig. 4(c) we see that  decays to zero much faster than that in Fig. 4(a) with the same . This point can be understood as follows. Because of the fluctuation of ,  in Fig. 4(c) will be changed around . Once it is located in the range ,  will decay faster than the case of  in Fig. 4(a), resulting in the fast decaying observed in Fig. 4(c). However, Fig. 4(d) shows a totally different picture where the recurrent behaviors of non-periodic epidemic patterns can be regenerated by a small but nonzero , indicating that the time-dependent  and the nonzero  are both the necessary conditions to guarantee the recurrent outbreaks. More detailed dependence on these parameters is shown in Figs 3, 4, 5 in SI.\n\nTo reveal the mechanism of the recurrent outbreaks in our network model, we show the corresponding relationship between  and the susceptible, infected, refractory densities in Fig. 5 where the parameters are taken as  and . Very interestingly, we find that the largest infection rate \u03b2 does not always induce the epidemic outbreak. Instead, the outbreak in Fig. 5(c) usually occurs at those relatively larger \u03b2, see the red dashed lines in Fig. 5. From Fig. 5(a,b,d) we notice that all the red dashed lines correspond to those points with both a larger \u03b2 and a larger  (or a smaller . This is reasonable as a larger  will provide enough population source for the epidemic to grow up and a larger \u03b2 satisfies the condition of . Therefore, a larger infection rate and a larger susceptible density are both the necessary conditions for the recurrent epidemic patterns with non-periodicity. Its theoretical explanation will be given in the section of Methods.\n\nOne more key question is how the network topology influences the recurrent outbreaks of epidemic. To answer this question, we first consider the influence of the average degree . Figure 6(a,b) show the numerical results of two typical cases, i.e. approximately half average degree of Fig. 4 in (a) and approximately double average degree of Fig. 4 in (b). Comparing them with Fig. 4(d), it is easy to see that there is much less outbreaks in Fig. 6(a) but more outbreaks in Fig. 6(b), indicating that larger  is in favor of the recurrent outbreaks.\n\nSecondly, we consider the influence of degree distribution, i.e. replacing the UCM network with a power-law degree distribution by an Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi (ER) networks with a Poisson distribution49. We let the constructed ER network have the same size  and the same average degree  as in Fig. 4. Fig. 6 in SI shows the result. Comparing it with Fig. 4(d), we see that they are similar, except that the recurrent outbreak in UCM network is slightly easier to be observed than in ER network. Furthermore, we have also checked the influence of  on ER network. Figure 6(c) and (d) show the numerical results, corresponding to Fig. 6(a,b). Comparing Fig. 6(a,b) with (c) and (d), respectively, we see that both (a) and (c) have only a few outbreaks while both (b) and (d) have frequent outbreaks, indicating the robustness to network topologies.\n\nThe epidemic spreading on networks is a very hot topic in the field of complex network in recent years, which focuses mainly on the epidemic threshold and how the spreading is influenced by the network structure and other parameters, but to our knowledge, it does not deal with the topic of the recurrent outbreaks of epidemic in complex networks so far. At the same time, the recurrence of influenza has been also paid some attention in a parallel line, which mainly focuses on the mechanism of periodic outbreaks, but it does not deal with the influence of network structures. We here combine these two parallel lines together by presenting a SIRS network model to describe the recurrent epidemic patterns. This work is mainly focused on the non-periodicity observed from the Hong Kong influenza data and other data, in contrast to the previous focus on the periodicity of recurrent epidemic patterns. This understanding to non-periodicity will be useful in a global effort to reduce the impact of a realistic influenza pandemic.\n\nBy this network model we reveal that the recurrent outbreaks of epidemic is closely related to three parameters, i.e. the fluctuation of , the small infection probability  in nature and the average degree  of network. For the first one, a fluctuated  means that it is possible for a smaller  to be followed by a larger . In the time period of the smaller , the infected density will be small and thus the susceptible density will be large, which provides enough susceptible source. In the coming period of the larger , we have  and thus the sufficient susceptible people will guarantee an outbreak. When this condition is satisfied from time to time, we will have the recurrent outbreaks. For the second one, previous studies did not consider  but just initial infected seeds. When the network has an epidemic outbreak, it will come to a decay period until no infected ones in the system, and thus no possibility for a further outbreak. In this sense, a persistent  is necessary to ignite another outbreak and is also consistent with practical cases where there is always a small possibility for infected seeds to be generated naturally. For the third one, a smaller average degree means that an infected seed does not have enough neighbors to be infected and thus cannot induce an outbreak. While a larger average degree can provide sufficient neighbors to be infected and thus can induce an outbreak. In sum, these three parameters work together to generate the recurrent outbreaks of epidemic. After understanding this point, we expect that an effective way to control the recurrent outbreaks can be also found by considering these three factors. For example, we can reduce  to a small quantity by increasing  as large as possible by vaccinating more and more people.\n\nWe take the uncorrelated configuration model (UCM) as an example. We first construct the UCM network with a power-law degree distribution  by following ref. 48. We let its size be , average degree be , and let k be limited in the range . Then, we consider the case that each node of the UCM network is occupied by a person and take the SIRS model for the epidemic spreading, see the schematic plot in Fig. 3. We let a susceptible person have two ways to be infected. One is the infection by a small probability , representing the natural infection from environment or unknown reasons. The other is the infection by a contagious rate \u03b2, representing the infection from contacting with an infected person. When a susceptible node has  infected neighbors, it will become infected with probability . At the same time, the infected node will decay into a refractory one with probability \u03bc. For the process from refractory to susceptible state, ref. 47 assumed that a person will stay at the refractory state for a constant time \u03c4 and then go back to the susceptible state. However, in reality, individuals may have different habitus and thus may need different \u03c4 to recover. To overcome this defect, instead of the fixed \u03c4, we here let each refractory person have a small probability \u03b4 to recover from the refractory to susceptible state. In numerical simulations, we fix  and .\n\nWe choose the dependence of  on time by the following way: we divide the time t into T intervals with equal length and let T = 52, corresponding to the 52 weeks in one year. We let  be a constant in each interval and different constants in different intervals. The value of the constant is randomly chosen from the Gaussian distribution with average  and standard deviation \u03c3. Once a negative  is chosen, we discard it and then choose a new one.\n\nLet , , and  be the probability for person i to be in the state of S, I and R at time t, respectively. Then we have  where  and  represent the densities of susceptible, infected, and refractory agents at time t, respectively. Let  and  be the transition probability from the state S to I, I to R and R to S, respectively. By the Markov chain approach550 we have\n\n\n\nwhere  represents the neighbors of node i. The term  in Eq. (1) represents the probability that node i is not infected by the environment. While the term  is the probability that node i is not infected by the infected neighbors. Thus,  is the probability for node i to be in susceptible state. Based on this analysis, we formulate the following difference equation model to help gain insights into the network model\u2019s dynamics\n\n\n\nThe first term on the right-hand side of the first equation of Eq. (2) is the probability that node i is remained as susceptible state. The second term stands for the probability that node i is changed from the refractory to susceptible state. Similarly, we have the same explanation for the second and third equations of Eq. (2). Substituting Eq. (1) into Eq. (2) we obtain\n\n\n\nInstead of getting the analytic solution of Eq. (3), we solve Eq. (3) by numerical integration. To conveniently compare with the model in section Results, we use the same set of time-dependent  to both the model and Eq. (3). In this way, we can obtain the corresponding theoretical results. The green solid lines in Fig. 5(b\u2013d) show the theoretical results from Eq. (3). Comparing them with the experimental results \u201ccircles\u201d there, we see that they are consistent with each other very well, indicating that Eq. (3) can completely explain the numerical results.\n\nHow to cite this article: Zheng, M. et al. Non-periodic outbreaks of recurrent epidemics and its network modelling. Sci.
