{"title": "Journal Pre-proof The Novel Coronavirus 2019 Epidemic and Kidneys The Novel Coronavirus 2019 Epidemic and Kidneys", "body": "Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a newly discovered contagious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, primarily manifesting as an acute respiratory illness with interstitial and alveolar pneumonia, but can affect multiple organs such as kidney, heart, digestive tract, blood and nervous system 1 East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-Co-V), have infected more than 10,000 people in the past 2 decades, with mortality rates of 10% and 37% respectively 4, 5 . COVID-19 is more contagious than these illnesses, spreads by human-to-human transmission via droplets, fecal or direct contact, and has an incubation period estimated at 1 to 14 days (usually 3 to 7 days).\n\nInfection has been reported in all ages, including children. The majority of infections are mild, presenting with a flu-like illness. The common clinical presentations of COVID-19 are fever (98%), cough (76%), and myalgia and fatigue (18% each) 6 \n\nThe diagnosis is mainly based on epidemiological factors (history of contact), clinical manifestations, and laboratory examination (hemogram, chest CT and virological examination, etc) 8 . Of note, there are recent cases without any travel history or apparent contact with infected individuals. Several COVID-19 nucleic acid detection assays have been developed, both in-house and commercial. They use fluorescence PCR, and probe anchoring polymerization technique. Gene sequencing has also been utilized. The World Health Organization has appointed several referral laboratories in different countries. 9 A serological test has been developed and allowed detection of a cluster of cases in Singapore 10 . More sensitive and convenient detection methods continue to be developed.\n\nIn previous reports of SARS and MERS-CoV infections, acute kidney injury (AKI) developed in 5-15% cases and carried a high (60-90%) mortality. Early reports suggested a lower incidence (3-9%) of AKI in those with COVID-19 infection 1,11-13 . Recent reports, however, have shown higher frequency of renal abnormalities. A study of 59 patients with COVID-19 found that 34% of patients developed massive albuminuria on the first day of admission, and 63% developed proteinuria during their stay in hospital 14 . BUN was elevated in 27% overall and two thirds of patients who died. CT scan of the kidneys showed reduced density, suggestive of inflammation and edema. Cheng et al 13 recently reported that amongst 710 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 44% had proteinuria and hematuria and 26.7% had hematuria on admission. The prevalence of elevated Scr and BUN were 15.5% and 14.1% respectively. AKI was an independent risk factor for patients' in-hospital mortality 13, 14 .\n\nThe exact mechanism of kidney involvement is unclear: postulated mechanisms include sepsis leading to cytokine storm syndrome or direct cellular injury due to the virus.\n\nAngiotensin converting enzyme and dipeptidyl peptidase 4, both expressed on renal tubular cells, were identified as binding partners for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively 15, 16 . Viral RNA has been identified in kidney tissue and urine in both infections 17, 18 . Recently, Zhong's lab in Guangzhou has successfully isolated SARS-CoV-2 from the urine sample of an infected patient, suggesting the kidney as the target of this novel coronavirus 19 .\n\nThe current treatment of COVID-19 with AKI includes general and supportive management, and kidney replacement therapy. There is no effective anti-viral therapy available at present.\n\nAll the patients with confirmed COVID-19 should be quarantined. A N-95 fit-tested respirator and protective clothes and equipment are essential. Early admission to ICUs in designated hospitals is recommended for severely ill patients. \n\nMonoclonal antibody directed against the RBD domain of the S protein of MERS-CoV has been found to have neutralizing activities in plaque assays in vitro. 29 A monoclonal antibody against COVID- 19 has not yet been developed. Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against the IL-6 receptor, has achieved encouraging preliminary clinical results. The safety and efficacy of Trastuzumab in COVID-19 infection is undergoing evaluation by a multicenter randomized controlled trial (ChiCTR2000029765). 17. Designated care personnel: All personnel involved in direct patient care should undertake full protection, including long-sleeved waterproof isolation clothing, hair caps, goggles, gloves and medical masks (surgical mask grade or above). Hand hygiene should be strictly implemented.\n\n18. Dialysis machine: Equipment that may come into contact with patients or potentially contaminated material should be disinfected according to standard protocols. 19 . If a new confirmed or highly suspected case of novel coronavirus infection in dialysis centers is identified, disinfection should be carried out immediately. Areas in close contact with these patients should not be used for other patients until cleared. 20 . The medical waste from confirmed or suspected patients with novel coronavirus infection should be considered as infectious medical wastes and disposed accordingly.\n\nAll the family members living with dialysis patients must follow all the precautions and regulations given to patients to prevent person-to-person and within family transmission of the COVID-19, which include body temperature measurement, good personal hygiene, handwashing, and prompt reporting of potentially sick people.\n\nDialysis patients, who have a family member or caregiver subject to \"basic quarantine\", can have dialysis as usual in accordance during the 14-day period.\n\nOnce the family members or caregiver of dialysis patients have been converted to a confirmed case, the patient's identity should be upgraded and treated in accordance with the above-mentioned conditions.\n\nIn summary, COVID-19, a disease caused by a novel coronavirus, is a major global human threat with a potential to turn into a pandemic. Kidney involvement seems to be frequent in this infection and AKI is an independent predictor of mortality. The impact of this infection in those with CKD has not been studied, and the management of patients on dialysis who have been suspected to have been in contact with COVID-19 should be carried out according to strict protocols to minimize risk to other patients and healthcare personnel taking care of these patients."}
