{"title": "", "body": "Respiratory infections, including tuberculosis, represent one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality across the world. They represent the deadliest communicable diseases causing 3.0 million deaths worldwide in 2016 [1] . The burden of respiratory infections can be unbearable for some health systems: they represent one of the most common reasons for doctor visits, regardless of age and sex [2] .\n\nAlthough respiratory infections have been identified as a mandatory topic in the education and training of respiratory physicians, the specialty has been faced with several challenges to implement training. There are ongoing discussions surrounding what is included and excluded epidemiologically within the parameters of respiratory infections. Thus it is no surprise that, at present, the vast majority of European countries do not yet have a formal system for educating respiratory physicians, at a specialty level, on the knowledge and skills considered essential in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of respiratory infections. Furthermore, European countries have very different resources dedicated to the continuing development of respiratory professionals.\n\nKeeping these educational and training challenges in mind, the European Respiratory Society (ERS) decided to support a group of experts in respiratory infections to define the core knowledge and skills considered essential to manage respiratory infections. The ERS respiratory infections educational task force was founded in 2014 and included 13 experts from six European countries (Italy, Germany, UK, the Netherlands, Spain and Greece). The task force had two main aims: 1) to develop a syllabus to guide the national training and education of respiratory physicians in the field of respiratory infections, and 2) to help structure ERS educational activities on respiratory infections. \n\nAs previously outlined [3] , the target audience for the syllabus are qualified respiratory physicians with a special interest in respiratory infections. Based on the situational analysis and the Delphi surveys, the target audience also includes infectious diseases specialists, intensive care unit specialists, internists, trainees, researchers and microbiologists, working in public hospitals or holding an academic position.\n\nThe approach, methods, and processes used in this project have been adapted from the ERS developed educational harmonisation framework, which, to date, has been used in the development of seven postgraduate curricula (www.ersnet.org/ professional-development/ers-curriculum-designa-summary-of-projects) and four specialised skillsbased training programmes [4] .\n\nTo develop the syllabus, a list of key topics was identified by the expert task force. A modified Delphi technique was applied to these topics to reach consensus. The Delphi technique is a group facilitation method that seeks to obtain consensus on the opinions of experts through a series of structured questionnaires [5] . Research and methods outlined by Heiko [6] were used to guide the decisions taken at various stages of this study, for example survey design, undertaking data collection and analysis.\n\nThe Delphi process was phased in three rounds (figure 1). Members of ERS Assembly 10 (respiratory infections) and national experts were asked to complete an online questionnaire, which was then processed by the ERS office. The results were presented to the task force for more detailed discussion. The decisions derived from these consultations were integrated into the next Delphi round (Delphi 1). It is to be noted that although the same respondents were contacted in each round, there was a drop off in the number of responses between rounds. Respondents were asked to rate in terms of agreement whether sections should be included (mandatory or optional) or excluded. A Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) was chosen to ensure measurement reliability over the three different Delphi rounds. Agreement was operationalised through a majority of responses in the top two points of the scale (measured as the sum of frequencies of agree and strongly agree responses). In Delphi studies consensus is considered a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for agreement concerning the inclusion of items [6] . The iteration of rounds was also required to establish the stability dimension for agreement. Stability was defined as \"the consistency of responses between successive rounds of a study\" [7] . Both consensus and stability dimensions were investigated in the study.\n\nThe content of the syllabus was organised in 14 modules, which were considered important and necessary topics or aspects forming the basis of the respiratory infections domain (table 1) .\n\nThe syllabus was developed to clearly define the remit for programme designers in the implementation of training and education for respiratory physicians. ERS is committed to the continuing professional development of respiratory professionals and will be using the ERS respiratory infections syllabus as a basis for several activities in the future, including: "}
