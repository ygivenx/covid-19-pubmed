{"title": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and bat coronavirus HKU9\nboth can utilize GRP78 for attachment onto host cells", "body": "Coronaviruses are known to infect a broad spectrum of species, ranging from birds to\nmammals, including humans (1\u20133). They are enveloped RNA viruses with large genome sizes of\n\u223c28\u201332 kb. Currently, coronaviruses are classified into four genera:\nAlphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and\nDeltacoronavirus (4).\nAmong them, six coronaviruses from the Alphacoronavirus genera and\nthe Betacoronavirus genera are known to cause human infections with\ndiverse outcomes. On the one hand, human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E),5 human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63),\nhuman coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), and human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1)\npredominantly cause mild and self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections (5, 6). In\nstark contrast, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that caused\nthe severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic between 2002 and 2003 was highly\npathogenic, which infected more than 8000 people with a fatality rate of \u223c10%\n(7, 8). Ten years later, another highly pathogenic human coronavirus, Middle\nEast respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), emerged in the Middle East in 2012\n(9). MERS-CoV caused severe lower\nrespiratory tract infections with an exceptionally high fatality rate of\n\u223c35%. Most importantly, despite global efforts trying to control the virus'\ndissemination, MERS-CoV still spread to over 27 countries and has been causing\ncontinuous infections in the Middle East since 2012 (10).\n\nThe interaction between the spike protein and its receptor is the main determinant of\nhost tropism for coronaviruses (11). Among\nthe six human coronaviruses, the Alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E spike\nbinds aminopeptidase N (12), whereas the\nlineage C Betacoronavirus the MERS-CoV spike recognizes dipeptidyl\npeptidase 4 (DPP4) (13). Intriguingly, the\nAlphacoronavirus HCoV-NL63 and the lineage B\nBetacoronavirus SARS-CoV both utilize angiotensin-converting\nenzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell entry (14, 15). However, the protein receptors for the\nlineage A Betacoronavirus HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are currently\nunknown. In addition to their designated receptors, coronavirus spikes are known to\nrecognize a broad array of cell-surface molecules, which serve to facilitate the\nattachment or entry of the viruses. For example, HCoV-NL63 and mouse hepatitis virus\nboth employ heparan sulfate proteoglycans to enhance attachment (16, 17).\nSimilarly, transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus, bovine coronavirus, HCoV-OC43,\nand HCoV-HKU1 bind to O-acetylated sialic acid as key attachment\nmolecules (18\u201321).\nInterestingly, in addition to utilizing O-acetylated sialic acid as\na critical binding determinant (21),\nHCoV-HKU1 spike also recognizes major histocompatibility complex class I C as\nanother attachment molecule (22). In the case\nof SARS-CoV, dendritic cell\u2013specific intercellular adhesion\nmolecule-3\u2013grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and DC-SIGN\u2013related both\naugment virus entry (23, 24). For MERS-CoV, we previously reported\ncarcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) as an attachment\nfactor that could modulate MERS-CoV entry in permissive cells (25). More recently, tetraspanin CD9 was identified as a host\ncell- -surface factor that facilitated MERS-CoV entry by scaffolding host cell\nreceptors and proteases (26).\n\nKnowledge of the interaction between coronavirus spikes and cell-surface host factors\ncontributes to the understanding of coronavirus biology on many aspects, including\ntropism, pathogenicity, as well as potential intervention strategies. To this end,\nwe aimed to investigate whether additional cell-surface molecules were involved in\nthe attachment or entry of MERS-CoV. In this study, we reported that the MERS-CoV\nspike could recognize a 78-kDa glucose\u2013regulated protein (GRP78). Although\ntraditionally regarded as an ER protein with chaperone activity, recent discoveries\nsuggest that GRP78 is also localized to the cell surface, where they carry out\nphysiological functions that regulate signaling and cellular homeostasis (27). Subsequent experiments demonstrated that\nGRP78 did not render nonpermissive cells susceptible to MERS-CoV infection but\nplayed a positive role in augmenting MERS-CoV entry in permissive cells, suggesting\nthat GRP78 is an attachment factor of MERS-CoV that can modulate MERS-CoV entry in\nthe presence of the host cell receptor DPP4. Importantly, our data further indicated\nthat the spike protein of a lineage D Betacoronavirus, bat\ncoronavirus HKU9 (bCoV-HKU9), also recognized GRP78, which played a key role in the\nattachment of HKU9\u2013S-pseudovirus to the bat Rousettus\nleschenaulti kidney (RLK) cells. Our findings highlight the importance\nof the possible evolution of different animal and human coronaviruses to become\ncapable of using not just the same host receptors but also the same attachment\nfactors, which may facilitate animal coronaviruses to jump the interspecies barrier\ninto human.\n\nWe previously identified human carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion\nmolecule 5 (CEACAM5) as an attachment factor for MERS-CoV (25). In this study, we asked whether additional membrane\nproteins could interact with the MERS-CoV spike and facilitate the entry or\nattachment of MERS-CoV. To this end, we transfected human bronchus epithelial\ncells, BEAS2B, with the MERS-CoV spike and evaluated the membrane proteins that\nmight bind the MERS-CoV spike in the transfected cells. In brief, membrane\nproteins from pcDNA\u2013MERS-CoV\u2013S1\u2013V5-transfected BEAS2B cells\nwere extracted and sedimented (Fig. 1). To\nevaluate the extraction efficiency, the cell extracts were probed for markers of\ndifferent cellular fractions, including that of the plasma membrane (epidermal\ngrowth factor receptor (EGFR) and pan-cadherin), endoplasmic reticulum (ER)\n(calreticulin), Golgi (giantin), and nucleus (lamin A). Western blotting\nanalyses revealed that our membrane extracts were enriched with the plasma\nmembrane markers, EGFR and pan-cadherin. In contrast, only a trace amount of the\nER marker was observed, whereas the signal for Golgi and nucleus was not\ndetected (Fig. 1D and\nFig.\nS1).\n\nTo identify potential proteins that could interact with the MERS-CoV spike, the\nmembrane extracts were immunoprecipitated with a V5 mAb and protein\nA/G-Sepharose. The precipitated beads were then washed, and protein complexes\nwere eluted with 0.1 m glycine. Co-immunoprecipitated proteins were\nrevealed in SDS-PAGE after silver staining (Fig.\n1A, lane 1). The eluted beads were\nresuspended in sample loading buffer, boiled, and assessed for elution\nefficiency (Fig. 1A,\nlane 2). As a control, the same set of membrane extracts\nwas immunoprecipitated with isotype antibody and protein A/G-Sepharose (Fig. 1A, lane\n3). In parallel, the expression of the MERS-CoV spike in the\nimmunoprecipitated complexes was validated with Western blotting using a mouse\nimmune serum against the MERS-CoV spike (Fig.\n1B). Specific protein bands that were pulled down by\nthe V5 antibody but not the isotype control were excised and sent for MS\nanalysis. The MS/MS result revealed one of the dominant bands (Fig. 1A, lane 1,\narrowhead) to be 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), also\nknown as heat shock 70-kDa protein 5 (HSPA5) or binding immunoglobulin protein\n(BiP) (Fig. 1E).\n\nTo further verify the interaction between the MERS-CoV spike and GRP78, we\nattempted to immunoprecipitate GRP78 with purified the MERS-CoV spike proteins.\nTo this end, recombinant MERS-CoV\u2013S1\u2013FLAG proteins were expressed,\npurified, and immunoprecipitated against the membrane protein extracts from\nBEAS2B cells. Notably, silver staining of the SDS-PAGE and the subsequent MS\nconfirmed the presence of GRP78 in the precipitated\nMERS-CoV\u2013S1\u2013FLAG complex (Fig.\n1C, lane 1, arrowhead) but not in\nthe control (Fig. 1C,\nlane 3). Taken together, our membrane pulldown assay\nidentified GRP78 as a potential membrane protein specifically bound by the\nMERS-CoV spike.\n\nNext, to examine the direct interaction between GRP78 and the MERS-CoV spike, we\nperformed a series of co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays in both\noverexpression and endogenous settings. First, BHK21 cells were transfected with\nGRP78\u2013V5 or the pcDNA\u2013V5 control vector. The cell lysates of the\ntransfected cells were then immunoprecipitated with either\nMERS-CoV\u2013S1\u2013FLAG or Escherichia coli bacterial\nalkaline phosphatase\u2013FLAG (BAP\u2013FLAG) pre-adsorbed on anti-FLAG\nM2-agarose beads. The precipitated protein complexes were then detected by\nWestern blotting with the anti-FLAG or the anti-V5 antibody. As illustrated in\nFig. 2A, GRP78\nspecifically immunoprecipitated with MERS-CoV\u2013S1 (lower panel,\nlane 1) but not the control bait protein, BAP (lower panel,\nlane 2). Additionally, GRP78 was not precipitated in cells\ntransfected with the empty vector (Fig.\n2A, lower panel, lane 3). To\nconfirm the interaction between GRP78 and MERS-CoV\u2013S1, we performed\nreciprocal co-IP using GRP78 as the bait protein (Fig. 2B). In this setting, cell lysates of\nGRP78\u2013V5 or empty vector transfected BHK21 cells were immunoprecipitated\nwith anti-V5 pre-adsorbed protein A/G-Sepharose and incubated with purified\nMERS-CoV\u2013S1\u2013FLAG or BAP\u2013FLAG. Our result demonstrated that\nMERS-CoV\u2013S1\u2013FLAG but not BAP\u2013FLAG was efficiently\nimmunoprecipitated by GRP78\u2013V5 (Fig.\n2B, upper panel, lanes 1 and\n2). As a negative control, the expression of\npcDNA\u2013V5 empty vector failed to immunoprecipitate with\nMERS-CoV\u2013S1\u2013FLAG (Fig.\n2B, upper panel, lane 3). In\nparallel, MERS-CoV\u2013S1\u2013FLAG did not co-IP with the abundantly\nexpressed cell-surface protein EGFR, suggesting the interaction between\nMERS-CoV\u2013S1\u2013FLAG and GRP78 was specific (Fig. S2,\nA and B). Next, we\nevaluated whether the interaction between the MERS-CoV spike and GRP78 could\noccur at the cell surface. To this end, we obtained the membrane fraction of\nHuh7 cells that was predominantly enriched with the plasma membrane contents of\nthe cells. We then added MERS-CoV\u2013S1\u2013FLAG protein to the membrane\nextracts and performed co-IP between the MERS-CoV spike and GRP78. Our data\nshowed that the MERS-CoV spike and the endogenous GRP78 in the membrane extract\ncould efficiently interact with each other (Fig.\n2, C and D).\n\nTo further verify the physical interaction between GRP78 and the MERS-CoV spike\nin a physiological relevant scenario, we performed endogenous co-IP experiments\nin MERS-CoV\u2013infected Huh7 and BEAS2B cells (Fig. 2E). In line with our earlier findings, GRP78\nefficiently immunoprecipitated the MERS-CoV spike from cell lysates of the\ninfected samples. In contrast, the MERS-CoV spike was not detected from the\nmock-infected samples or from infected samples immunoprecipitated with a control\nisotype antibody. The reciprocal co-IP performed using the MERS-CoV spike as the\nbait similarly immunoprecipitated endogenous GRP78 from the infected samples but\nnot from mock-infected samples or from infected samples immunoprecipitated with\nthe control isotype antibody (Fig.\n2E). Collectively, our co-IP data established GRP78\nas a specific binding target of the MERS-CoV spike.\n\nGRP78 is a highly conserved protein that is traditionally described as an\nER-residing chaperone and plays key roles in facilitating protein folding and\nassembly as well as the regulation of ER stress (28). In recent years, multiple functions of GRP78 on the cell\nsurface have been reported, including a critical role of cell-surface GRP78 on\nvirus entry (29\u201331). Because\nour earlier data suggested that the MERS-CoV spike could interact with plasma\nmembrane GRP78, we hypothesized that GRP78 might be involved in modulating\nMERS-CoV entry or attachment. To this end, we first analyzed GRP78 expression on\nthe cell surface of human lung cell lines that are susceptible to MERS-CoV\ninfection (32, 33). As illustrated in Fig.\n3A, GRP78 was readily detected on the cell surface\nof human lung cell lines, including A549, BEAS2B, and Calu3. In addition, GRP78\nexpression was also observed on the cell surface of a broad array of human cell\nlines (AD293, Caco2, HeLa, and Huh7) and primary cells (monocyte-derived\nmacrophage (MDM), T cell) of extrapulmonary origin (Fig. 3B). Intriguingly, surface GRP78\nexpression was similarly detected in nonhuman cell lines, including BHK21, L929,\nVeroE6, and RLK. Quantitative analysis of the expression rate (Fig. 3D) and mean\nfluorescent intensity (MFI) (Fig.\n3E) from the immunolabeled cells revealed that\nsurface DPP4 and GRP78 were expressed at comparative levels in most measured\ncell lines with the exception of L929. The ubiquitous detection of GRP78 across\ncell lines from different species by the human GRP78 antibody could be\nattributed to the high degree of GRP78 sequence homology between mammalian\nspecies, suggesting that the protein is well conserved in mammalian cells (Fig. 3F). Altogether, the\nsurface expression of GRP78 on MERS-CoV\u2013susceptible cells supported the\nnotion that GRP78 might be involved in modulating MERS-CoV entry. However, the\nubiquitous expression of GRP78, particularly on cells that are not permissive to\nMERS-CoV infection, including BHK21 and L929, suggested that GRP78 might play an\nauxiliary rather than a determining role in MERS-CoV entry.\n\nIn order for GRP78 to modulate virus entry, it must be expressed by the\nsusceptible cells at the site of infection. To explore the potential\nphysiological relevance of GRP78 during MERS-CoV entry, we examined the\ndistribution of GRP78 in human lung tissues with confocal microscopy. Our\nimmunostaining results demonstrated that GRP78 was expressed at multiple regions\nof the human lung tissues. In particular, specific GRP78 expression was\nabundantly detected on the epithelial cells of the bronchus (Fig. 4A), bronchiole (Fig. 4B), and alveolus\n(Fig. 4C). Most\nimportantly, double immunostaining of DPP4 and GRP78 revealed extensive\nco-localization of DPP4 and GRP78 among the epithelial cells lining the human\nairways (Fig. 4,\nA\u2013C). The co-localization between DPP4 and GRP78 on\nthe apical side of the epithelial cells indicated the potential of GRP78 in\nfacilitating MERS-CoV entry or attachment (Fig.\n4D, arrows). Interestingly, the\nco-expression of DPP4 and GRP78 could also be recognized in extrapulmonary\ntissues, including the small intestine (Fig.\nS3A) and the kidney (Fig.\nS3B). Overall, our data demonstrated that\nGRP78 was co-expressed with DPP4 on physiologically relevant cell types in the\nhuman lung and could potentially be involved during MERS-CoV infection in the\nlower respiratory tract.\n\nTo investigate the functional role of cell-surface GRP78 during MERS-CoV\ninfection, we first evaluated the capacity of GRP78 antibody in blocking the\nentry of MERS\u2013S-pseudovirus. In this set of experiments, Huh7 and BEAS2B\ncells were pre-incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against GRP78 or a\nnontargeting rabbit control IgG. After the pre-incubation,\nMERS\u2013S-pseudoviruses were added to the cells for 1 h in the presence of\nthe GRP78 antibody or the control IgG. At 72 h post-inoculation, the cells were\nlysed and incubated with luciferase substrate for the quantification of\ninfectivity. Our results demonstrated that GRP78 antibody but not the control\nIgG reduced MERS\u2013S-pseudovirus entry in both Huh7 (Fig. 5A) and BEAS2B cells (Fig. 5B) in a dose-dependent\nmanner. In stark contrast, the entry of the control vesicular stomatitis virus\nglycoprotein (VSV-G)-pseudovirus in both cell lines was not inhibited by GRP78\nantibody (Fig. 5, A and\nB). Next, we proceeded to validate the antibody blocking\nresults using infectious MERS-CoV. To this end, Huh7 cells were pre-incubated\nwith antibodies and subsequently infected with MERS-CoV in the presence of\ncontrol IgG, GRP78 antibody, or DPP4 antibody. Our data showed that the\ntreatment of GRP78 antibody similarly inhibited MERS-CoV entry in a\ndose-dependent manner (Fig.\n5C). For further verification, we infected Huh7 and\nBEAS2B cells with MERS-CoV after siRNA knockdown of GRP78 or DPP4. Western\nblotting detection demonstrated that GRP78 knockdown did not affect DPP4 or\nCEACAM5 expression (Fig.\n5D). In line with the antibody blocking results,\ndepletion of GRP78 reduced MERS-CoV entry in both Huh7 and BEAS2B cells (Fig. 5E). Because CEACAM5\nwas expressed in Huh7 but not BEAS2B cells, our data implied that the role of\nGRP78 in modulating MERS-CoV entry was independent of CEACAM5 expression. To\nfurther evaluate the role of GRP78 on MERS-CoV replication, we assessed virus\ngrowth in MERS-CoV\u2013infected BEAS2B cells after siRNA knockdown of GRP78\nor DPP4. Our data demonstrated that GRP78 depletion decreased MERS-CoV\nreplication, although to a lesser extent compared with that of DPP4 knockdown\n(Fig. 5, F and\nG). Next, we asked whether GRP78 could play a role in\nMERS-CoV entry in the physiologically relevant primary cells. To this end, we\nperformed siRNA knockdown of GRP78 (Fig.\n5H) in primary human MDM and primary human embryonic\nlung fibroblasts (HFL), which are both susceptible to MERS-CoV infection as\nreported in our previous studies (32,\n34). In agreement with our results\nfrom Huh7 and BEAS2B cells, GRP78 knockdown significantly reduced virus entry\n(Fig. 5I) and\nreplication (Fig. 5, J and\nK) in MDM and HFL. Collectively, with antibody blocking and\nsiRNA knockdown, we demonstrated a significant role of GRP78 during MERS-CoV\nentry.\n\nOur earlier data supported the notion that cell-surface GRP78 was involved in\nMERS-CoV entry. To define the functional role of GRP78 during this process, we\nchallenged AD293 or BHK21 cells with MERS-CoV after GRP78 overexpression. First,\nwe sought to evaluate the capacity of GRP78 in facilitating MERS-CoV attachment.\nTo this end, GRP78-transfected AD293 or BHK21 cells were challenged with\nMERS-CoV at 4 \u00b0C for 2 h. After the incubation, the cells were washed,\nfixed, and immunolabeled for MERS-CoV N. As illustrated in Fig. 6A, GRP78 overexpression significantly\nincreased virus attachment in both AD293 and BHK21 cells. Interestingly, GRP78\noverexpression appeared to induce a more substantial increase in MERS-CoV\nattachment in the MERS-CoV\u2013nonsusceptible BHK21 cells than that in the\nMERS-CoV\u2013susceptible AD293 cells (Fig.\n6B). Next, to address whether GRP78 could\nindependently facilitate MERS-CoV entry, we assessed the level of MERS-CoV entry\nin AD293 and BHK21 cells upon GRP78 overexpression. To this end,\nGRP78-transfected AD293 and BHK21 cells were challenged with MERS-CoV at 37\n\u00b0C for 2 h. After infection, the cells were washed and incubated for\nanother 4 h before harvesting for flow cytometry. Importantly, our result\ndemonstrated that the nonpermissive BHK21 cells remained refractory to MERS-CoV\ninfection despite GRP78 overexpression. In contrast, GRP78 overexpression\nfurther enhanced the entry of MERS-CoV to the permissive AD293 cells (Fig. 6, C and\nD). The effect of GRP78 on MERS-CoV entry was not due to ER\nstress (Fig.\nS4). Overall, our data indicated that GRP78 could not facilitate\nMERS-CoV entry independently but could serve as an attachment factor and\nmodulate MERS-CoV entry in the presence of DPP4.\n\nBecause infections by certain coronaviruses, including infectious bronchitis\nvirus and SARS-CoV, are known to induce ER stress (35\u201339), which can\npromote GRP78 expression on the cell surface (40\u201343), we asked whether MERS-CoV infection\ncould up-regulate GRP78 expression on the cell surface. To address this\nquestion, we infected Huh7 cells with MERS-CoV (Fig. 7, A and B) and harvested\nsamples for flow cytometry at 24 h post-infection. Our result demonstrated that\nalthough the percentage of surface DPP4-positive cells modestly decreased after\nMERS-CoV infection, the percentage of surface GRP78-positive cells significantly\nincreased from \u223c50 to \u223c80% after MERS-CoV infection (Fig. 7, C and\nD). In this regard, our results highlighted the potential\nrelevance of GRP78 on MERS-CoV attachment onto the infected cells.\n\nCoronaviruses have evolved a complicated receptor recognition system through\ntheir spike proteins. Peculiarly, the spike proteins from highly-related\ncoronaviruses can recognize different cell-surface molecules, whereas the spike\nproteins of phylogenetically distant coronaviruses can bind the same\ncell-surface molecule for attachment or entry (11). By exploring the potential interaction between GRP78 and the\nspike proteins of other coronaviruses, we unexpectedly discovered that GRP78\ncould interact with the spike protein of bat coronavirus HKU9 (bCoV-HKU9) (Fig. 8A). Interestingly,\ndespite the capacity of binding the spike proteins of lineage C (MERS-CoV) and\nlineage D (bCoV-HKU9) Betacoronavirus, GRP78 did not interact\nwith the spike protein of SARS-CoV, which is a lineage B\nBetacoronavirus (Fig.\n8B). In 2007, we reported the first discovery and\ngenome characterization of bCoV-HKU9, which was identified from Leschenault's\nrousette bats (R. leschenaulti) (44). Recently, with structural analysis and surface plasmon\nresonance assay, it appeared that the receptor-binding domain of bCoV-HKU9 spike\nwas incapable of reacting with either human DPP4 or ACE2 (45). In this regard, it would be important to explore the\npotential physiological relevance of the interaction between GRP78 and bCoV-HKU9\nspike. We first evaluated the cell tropism of HKU9\u2013S-pseudovirus with\nMERS\u2013S-pseudovirus included as a control. Remarkably, our data suggested\nthat among the 10 evaluated mammalian cell lines, HKU9\u2013S-pseudovirus\nentry was most pronounced in R. leschenaulti kidney (RLK) cells\n(Fig. 8C). Notably,\nalthough MERS\u2013S-pseudovirus entry was evident in RLK cells, culture for\nbCoV-HKU9 in RLK or other cell lines has not been successful (44). In line with the pseudovirus entry\nresult, the surface-binding efficiency of HKU9\u2013S-pseudovirus on RLK cells\nwas \u223c3-fold that on Caco2 cells (Fig.\n8D), which is a human colon cell line known to be\npermissive for both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection. Notably, overexpression of\nhuman GRP78 in the apparently nonpermissive L929 and BHK21 cells did not render\nthe cells permissive to HKU9\u2013S-pseudovirus entry, indicating that GRP78\ncould not function as an independent receptor for bCoV-HKU9 (Fig. 8E). In contrast, with\na flow cytometry-based surface-binding assay, we demonstrated that the GRP78\nantibody (Fig. 8G) but not\nthe control IgG (Fig. 8F)\nreduced the binding of HKU9\u2013S-pseudovirus to the cell surface of RLK\ncells in a dose-dependent manner, which was evidenced by the drop in the\npercentage of HKU9\u2013S-positive cells (Fig.\n8H) as well as the decrease in the\nHKU9\u2013S-mean fluorescent intensity (Fig.\n8I). Taken together, our data identified GRP78 as an\nimportant cell surface\u2013binding protein for both MERS-CoV and bCoV-HKU9 by\nserving as an attachment factor.\n\nSialic acids were recently identified as an attachment determinant of MERS-CoV\n(46). To investigate whether GRP78\nand sialic acids could act in conjunction with each other in facilitating the\nattachment of MERS-CoV, we assessed MERS\u2013S-pseudovirus entry in the\npresence of a combination of neuraminidase treatment and GRP78 antibody\nblocking. Our results demonstrated that although neuraminidase treatment\ndecreased MERS\u2013S-pseudovirus entry in a dose-dependent manner, the\naddition of GRP78 antibody further enhanced the inhibitory effect (Fig. 9A). However, the entry\nof HKU9\u2013S-pseudovirus was inhibited by GRP78 antibody but not\nneuraminidase treatment (Fig.\n9B). Overall, the additive effect of neuraminidase\ntreatment and GRP78 antibody on limiting MERS\u2013S-pseudovirus entry\nsuggested that sialic acids and GRP78 both independently facilitated the\nattachment of MERS-CoV onto the cell surface, whereas GRP78 but not sialic acids\nplayed an important role for virus attachment of bCoV-HKU9.\n\nHost tropism is predominantly determined by the interaction between coronavirus\nspikes and their corresponding host receptors. In addition, the spike proteins of\ncoronaviruses can recognize a broad range of cell-surface molecules, which serve to\naugment coronavirus attachment or entry. In this study, we identified host GRP78 as\na novel interacting target of the MERS-CoV spike (Figs. 1 and 2). GRP78 was expressed\non the surface of MERS-CoV\u2013susceptible cell lines of pulmonary and\nextrapulmonary origin (Fig. 3). At the same\ntime, immunostaining of human lung tissues identified abundant co-expression of DPP4\nand GRP78 in the epithelial cells along the human airways (Fig. 4). Next, with antibody blocking and siRNA knockdown\nexperiments, our data indicated the involvement of GRP78 in MERS-CoV entry (Fig. 5). Overexpression assays of GRP78 in\nMERS-CoV\u2013permissive and MERS-CoV\u2013nonpermissive cells unambiguously\ndemonstrated that GRP78 did not independently render nonpermissive cells susceptible\nto MERS-CoV infection but could facilitate MERS-CoV entry in conjunction with DPP4\nby serving as an attachment factor (Fig. 6).\nIntriguingly, GRP78 was up-regulated upon MERS-CoV infection, which might further\nfacilitate virus attachment among the infected cells (Fig. 7). Most importantly, GRP78 was also recognized by the spike\nprotein of a bat Betacoronavirus, bCoV-HKU9. Our result further\nindicated that GRP78 was not the functional receptor of bCoV-HKU9 but could modulate\nHKU9\u2013S-pseudovirus attachment to RLK cells (Fig. 8). Simultaneous treatments of neuraminidase and GRP78 antibody\nblocking revealed that sialic acids and GRP78 both independently facilitated the\nattachment of MERS-CoV onto the cell surface, whereas virus attachment of bCoV-HKU9\nwas mediated by GRP78 but not sialic acids (Fig.\n9). Overall, our study identified GRP78 as an attachment factor that\nmight modulate virus entry for two phylogenetically related\nBetacoronaviruses of different lineages, MERS-CoV and\nbCoV-HKU9.\n\nGRP78, also referred to as BiP or HSPA5, is traditionally recognized as an ER\nchaperone (27). It is involved in a wide\nrange of physiological processes, including protein folding and assembly,\ntranslocation of newly synthesized polypeptides, degradation of misfolded proteins,\nas well as maintaining the ER homeostasis (27). In addition, GRP78 is an essential regulator of ER stress due to its\ncritical role in the unfolded protein response pathway. Despite its participation in\nER-related functions, GRP78 is also detected in other cellular fractions, including\nmitochondria, nucleus, cytosol, and plasma membrane (43). In recent years, an increasing number of studies have described the\nphysiological role of cell-surface GRP78 during virus entry. For instance, GRP78 was\nidentified as a co-receptor for coxsackievirus A9 (CVA9) (30) and dengue virus (47). In addition, cell-surface GRP78 also facilitates the entry of Japanese\nencephalitis virus (29). Here, we reported\nGRP78 as a host factor that could serve as an attachment protein for two\nBetacoronaviruses, MERS-CoV and bCoV-HKU9. In its capacity as\nan attachment factor, GRP78 may serve to concentrate virus particles on the cell\nsurface, which may then increase the possibility of receptor-mediated virus entry\nfor MERS-CoV and bCoV-HKU9. Importantly, MERS-CoV infection resulted in an\nup-regulation of GRP78 on the cell surface, which may in turn increase the\nattachment of MERS-CoV and further enhance the possibility of virus entry in the\ninfected cells.\n\nCoronaviruses can recognize a wide range of cell-surface molecules, including cell\nmembrane proteins and sugars in addition to their cellular receptors. As an example,\nHCoV-NL63 employs ACE2 for host cell entry (14) but can bind to cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans to\nenhance attachment and infection of target cells (16). We have previously reported the identification of CEACAM5 as an\nattachment factor of MERS-CoV, which could facilitate MERS-CoV entry in the presence\nof DPP4 (25). Recently, CD9 was reported as a\nhost factor that could augment MERS-CoV entry by bringing the cellular receptor and\nproteases into close proximity, thus increasing the infection efficiency (26). In this study, the identification of GRP78\nas an attachment factor of MERS-CoV further indicated that the spike protein of\nMERS-CoV is highly efficient in engaging multiple cell surface factors to facilitate\nvirus entry. In contrast to CEACAM5, which is expressed on limited cell types (25), surface GRP78 expression appeared to be\nrelatively abundant across various cell types of different tissue origin (Fig. 3). In addition, a remarkable level of GRP78\nwas specifically detected on the epithelial cells along the human airways, where it\nwas found to colocalize with DPP4 (Fig. 4). In\nthis regard, it is tempting to speculate that the capacity of the MERS-CoV spike to\nutilize multiple host surface proteins, including CEACAM5, CD9, and GRP78, may give\nMERS-CoV a physiological advantage in establishing efficient infections, which may\ncontribute to the high pathogenicity of the virus.\n\nBat coronavirus HKU9 (bCoV-HKU9) is a representative lineage D\nBetacoronavirus. The virus was first identified in 2007 in a\nterritory-wide molecular surveillance study on bat samples from the Guangdong\nprovince of Southern China (44). Subsequent\nstudies suggested that the virus was widely distributed and was circulating in\ndifferent bat species (48\u201351). Structural and functional features of the receptor-binding domain\n(RBD) of bCoV-HKU9 demonstrated that the spike protein of the virus was incapable of\ninteracting with either DPP4 or ACE2 (45).\nHowever, the RBD of bCoV-HKU9 contained a conserved core structure that was shared\nacross other Betacoronaviruses, including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and\nbat coronavirus HKU4 (bCoV-HKU4) (45).\nNotably, recent reports demonstrated that bCoV-HKU4 could recognize human DPP4 as a\nfunctional receptor, indicating the potential of bat coronaviruses in human\nadaptations. In this regard, the identification of GRP78 as a shared attachment\nfactor for MERS-CoV and bCoV-HKU9 is interesting but alarming, which highlighted the\nimportance of continuous surveillance on the other members of the\nBetacoronavirus genus for their capacity of interspecies\ntransmission.\n\nIn summary, almost all presently circulating human coronaviruses have a\nphylogenetically-related virus partner found in animals. The human\nAlphacoronavirus HCoV-NL63 may be a recombinant between\nNL63-like viruses in Triaenops bats and 229E-like viruses\ncirculating in Hipposideros bats (52). Another human Alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E has\nclosely-related 229E-like coronaviruses recently isolated from dromedary camels\n(53). Similarly, the lineage A\nBetacoronavirus HCoV-OC43 was postulated to originate from a\nbovine coronavirus and jumped into human in the 1890s (2, 54). The lineage B\nBetacoronavirus, SARS-CoV, originated from either civets or\nbats, which jumped into human in 2003 (55,\n56), whereas the lineage C\nBetacoronavirus, MERS-CoV, is likely to have jumped from camels\ninto human in 2012 (57, 58). Because three (lineages A, B, and C) out of four lineages\nof animal Betacoronaviruses have independently jumped from animal\ninto human in the recent past, there is enough reason to suspect that a lineage D\nBetacoronavirus may also jump into human one day. Our finding\nof the lineage C MERS-CoV and lineage D bCoV-HKU9 sharing the same host attachment\nfactor GRP78 highlights the importance of monitoring the evolution of bCoV-HKU9,\nwhich may jump the interspecies barrier into human leading to another major epidemic\nin the future.\n\nA549, AD293 (a derivative of the commonly used HEK293 cell line, with improved\ncell adherence), HeLa, Huh7, Caco2, and VeroE6 cells were maintained in\nDulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated\nfetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/ml\nstreptomycin. BEAS2B (transformed epithelial cells isolated from normal human\nbronchial epithelium) and Calu3 cells were maintained in supplemented DMEM/F-12.\nBHK21, L929, RLK, and HFL were maintained in supplemented minimum essential\nmedium. Human primary monocytes were obtained from human peripheral blood\nmononuclear cells (PBMCs) as described previously (59). Primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were\ndifferentiated from monocytes in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)-1640\nmedia supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml\npenicillin, 2 mm glutamine, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% nonessential amino\nacids, and 10 ng/ml recombinant human granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating\nfactor (GM-CSF) (R&D Systems) (60).\nHuman primary T cells were isolated from PBMCs with negative selection using the\nDynabeads Untouched Human T cells kit (Invitrogen) as we described previously\n(61). Isolated T cells were\nmaintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 \u03bcg/ml\nstreptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 1% sodium pyruvate, and 1% nonessential\namino acids.\n\nMERS-CoV was a gift from Dr. Ron Fouchier (Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the\nNetherlands) and cultured in VeroE6 cells in serum-free DMEM. Virus titers were\nquantified with plaque assays as described previously (25).\n\nMERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (N) was detected with the in-house guinea pig\nanti-MERS\u2013CoV N serum as we described previously (32, 62). The\nMERS-CoV spike was detected with either the in-house mouse anti-MERS-CoV spike\nimmune serum or a rabbit anti-MERS-CoV spike antibody from Sino Biological\n(40069-RP02). An in-house mouse anti-bCoV-HKU9-spike immune serum was used to\ndetect bCoV-HKU9 spike. Primary antibodies, including rabbit anti-DPP4\n(ab28340), rabbit anti-GRP78 (ab21685), rabbit anti-pan-cadherin (ab16505),\nrabbit anti-calreticulin (ab2907), rabbit anti-GM130 (ab52649), rabbit anti-EGFR\n(ab52894), and rabbit anti-CEACAM5 (ab131070), were from Abcam. Rabbit\nanti-lamin A was from Sigma (SAB4501764). Rabbit control IgG was from\nThermoFisher Scientific (31235). Mouse anti-GRP78 antibody for Western blotting\nwas from R&D Systems (MAB4846). Rabbit anti-GRP78 from Novus Biologicals\n(NBP1-54318) and goat anti-CD26 from R&D Systems (AF1180) were used for\nantibody-blocking experiments. Rabbit anti-giantin was from Biolegend\n(A488-114L). The mouse anti-\u03b2-actin was from Sigma (A5441). The\nrecombinant FLAG-conjugated proteins were detected with an anti-FLAG M2 antibody\nfrom Sigma (F1804). The V5-tagged proteins were detected with mouse anti-V5\nantibodies from Immnoway (YM3005) or ThermoFisher Scientific (R96025). The\neGFP-tagged proteins were detected with a rabbit anti-eGFP from Abcam (ab290).\nSecondary antibodies, including Alexa Fluor 488/647 goat anti-guinea pig\n(A11073/A21450) and Alexa Fluor 488/647 goat anti-rabbit (A11008/A21245) from\nThermoFisher Scientific, were used for flow cytometry. The goat anti-mouse HRP\n(626520) and goat anti-rabbit HRP (656120) antibodies from ThermoFisher\nScientific were used for Western blottings.\n\nThe construction of pcDNA\u2013MERS\u2013CoV\u2013S was previously\ndescribed (25). Codon-optimized\nbCoV-HKU9-spike DNA was synthesized at GeneArt (ThermoFisher Scientific) based\non amino acid sequence of the bCoV-HKU9 (44) and cloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector. In parallel,\nbCoV-HKU9\u2013S1 was subcloned into the pSFV1 vector with a FLAG sequence\nin-frame in the 3\u2032-end for protein expression. The expression construct\nfor codon-optimized SARS-CoV spike, pcDNA-Sopt9, was a gift from Dr. Chen Zhiwei\nand was previously described (63). The\nconstruction of pSFV\u2013MERS-CoV\u2013S1\u2013FLAG was previously\ndescribed (25). The same ORF was\nPCR-amplified and subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+) vector in-frame with a V5 epitope,\nwhich resulted in pcDNA\u2013MERS-CoV\u2013S1\u2013V5. The GRP78-coding\nregion, including the N-terminal signal peptide, was obtained with RT-PCR from\nBEAS2B cells and cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) vector fused with V5, which resulted in\npcDNA\u2013GRP78\u2013V5.\n\nExpression of FLAG-tagged recombinant proteins was previously described (64, 65). In brief, linearized pSFV\u2013FLAG plasmids were transcribed\nin vitro, and the derived capped RNAs were electroporated\ninto BHK21 cells. At 15 h post-transfection, the cells were lysed, and the\nexpressed recombinant proteins were immunopurified using anti-FLAG\nM2\u2013coated beads (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The\npurified S protein was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Protein\nconcentration was quantified with the Pierce BCA assay (ThermoFisher\nScientific).\n\npcDNA\u2013MERS-CoV\u2013S1\u2013V5\u2013transfected BEAS2B cells\ncultured in 10-cm dishes were harvested by scraping cells into HEPES solution\n(10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm\nKCl) and centrifuging briefly at 500 \u00d7 g for 3 min. Cell\npellets were then homogenized in membrane lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl,\npH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 (Calbiochem), 1%\nn-dodecyl \u03b2-maltoside (ThermoFisher Scientific), 5%\nglycerol, pH 7.5, with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and\nincubated on ice for 30 min. Residual cellular debris and nuclei in the\nresulting extracts were sedimented by centrifugation at 4 \u00b0C for 5 min at\n6000 \u00d7 g. The solubilized membrane proteins in the\nsupernatant were transferred and subjected to an additional spin at 16,000\n\u00d7 g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C, and the membrane extracts\nwere then resuspended in lysis buffer. All extracts were quantitated using the\nPierce BCA assay kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) and stored in aliquots at\n\u221280 \u00b0C until used.\n\nMembrane proteins from\npcDNA\u2013MERS-CoV\u2013S1\u2013V5\u2013transfected BEAS2B cells were\nimmunoprecipitated with mAb against V5 (ThermoFisher Scientific, R96025) and\nSepharose A/G beads (ThermoFisher Scientific). In parallel, the membrane\nproteins from the BEAS2B cells were immunoprecipitated with purified\nMERS-CoV\u2013S1\u2013FLAG protein, anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma, F1804),\nand Sepharose A/G beads (ThermoFisher Scientific). Pulled down proteins reactive\nto anti-V5 beads were washed and incubated with 0.1 m glycine, pH 3.5,\nand those reactive to anti-FLAG M2 beads were eluted in 3\u00d7 FLAG peptide\nsolution (Sigma, 150 ng/\u03bcl final concentration). Eluted samples were\nspin-dialyzed in Amicon spin column with 10-kDa cutoff (Millipore) and separated\nby SDS-PAGE, stained with SilverQuest kit (ThermoFisher Scientific). The gel\nfragment was excised for LC-MS/MS analysis carried out in the Center for Genomic\nSciences, University of Hong Kong. MS/MS data were searched against all\nmammalian protein databases in NCBI and Swiss-Prot. The protein was identified\nas GRP78 with significant hits over different domains of the sequence.\n\nLentivirus-based coronavirus spike pseudoviruses were generated by\nco-transfection of 293FT cells with the pcDNA full-length spike plasmids in\ncombination with the HIV-1 backbone plasmid-bearing luciferase reporter gene,\npNL4\u20133-\u0394E-Luc (obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference\nReagent Program) using Lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher Scientific). Cells\ntransfected overnight were replenished with fresh medium supplemented with 1\nmm sodium pyruvate (ThermoFisher Scientific). Supernatants were\nharvested 48 h post-transfection, filtered through a 0.45-\u03bcm syringe\nfilter, and concentrated by ultracentrifugation in 30% sucrose solution in a\nBeckman rotor SW32Ti at 32,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. The virus pellets were\nresuspended in PBS, aliquoted, and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. The p24\nconcentrations were quantified using a p24 enzyme-linked immunoassay kit (Cell\nBioLabs). Pseudovirus titer was quantified in units of lentiviral particle (LP)\nper ml according to the manufacturer's instruction.\n\nCoronavirus spike pseudoviruses were used to infect 5 \u00d7 103\ntarget cells in white 96-well plates (Corning-Costar). After incubating the\ncultures for 72 h at 37 \u00b0C, the cells were first washed with PBS\n(ThermoFisher Scientific). The cells were then lysed with the lysis buffer\n(Promega) on ice, and luciferase substrate (Promega) was then added immediately.\nThe infectivity was measured using a microplate reader (Beckman DTX880) as\nrelative light units (RLU). Uninfected cells were included as mock controls for\nall experiments. All experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at\nleast two times.\n\nCells were lysed in RLT buffer with 40 mm DTT and extracted with the\nRNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Viral RNA in the supernatant was extracted with the\nPureLink Viral RNA/DNA mini kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). Reverse transcription\n(RT) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) were performed with the Transcriptor First\nStrand cDNA synthesis kit and LightCycler 480 master mix from Roche Applied\nScience as we previously described (34).\nIn the RT reactions, reverse primers against the N gene of MERS-CoV were used to\ndetect cDNA complementary to the positive strand of viral genomes. The following\nsets of primers were used to detect N in qPCR: forward,\n5\u2032-CAAAACCTTCCCTAAGAAGGAAAAG-3\u2032, reverse,\n5\u2032-GCTCCTTTGGAGGTTCAGACAT-3\u2032, and probe (6-carboxyfluorescein),\n5\u2032-ACAAAAGGCACCAAAAGAAGAATCAACAGACC-3\u2032 BHQ1.\n\nRLK cells were pre-incubated with the rabbit anti-GRP78 antibody (Novus\nBiologicals, NBP1-54318) or the rabbit control IgG (ThermoFisher Scientific,\n31235) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. After the pre-incubation,\nHKU9\u2013S-pseudoviruses were inoculated to the cells for attachment at 100\nLP per cell at 4 \u00b0C for 2 h. After 2 h of incubation, the cells were washed\ntwice with chilled PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. The fixed\ncells were immunolabeled for the bCoV-HKU9 spike with the in-house mouse\nbCoV-HKU9 spike immune serum and the mouse Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse\nsecondary antibody (ThermoFisher Scientific). The binding of the\nHKU9\u2013S-pseudoviruses was assessed with flow cytometry.\n\nHuh7 cells were pre-incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-GRP78 (Novus\nBiologicals, NBP1-54318) at different concentrations ranging from 0 to 5\n\u03bcg/ml. Goat polyclonal anti-DPP4 at 5 \u03bcg/ml (R&D, AF1180) and\nrabbit IgG at 5 \u03bcg/ml (ThermoFisher Scientific, 31235) were included as\ncontrols. After pre-incubating with the antibodies for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, the\ncells were challenged with MERS-CoV at 1 m.o.i. for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C in the\npresence of antibodies. The cells were subsequently washed with PBS and lysed\nwith RLT (Qiagen) with 40 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). The virus copy\nnumber was quantified with qPCR as described previously (25).\n\nON-TARGETplus human GRP78 siRNA (L-008198-00-0005) and ON-TARGETplus nontargeting\nsiRNA (L-001810-10-0020) were obtained from Dharmacon. Transfection of siRNA on\nBEAS2B, Huh7, MDM, or HFL cells was performed using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX\n(ThermoFisher Scientific) following the manufacturer's manual. In brief, the\ncells were transfected with 75 nm siRNA for 2 consecutive days. At 24 h\nafter the second siRNA transfection, the cells were counted and harvested in\nRIPA for Western blottings. In parallel, siRNA-transfected cells were challenged\nwith MERS-CoV at 1 m.o.i. for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. Following the incubation, the\ncells were washed with PBS and lysed in RLT buffer (Qiagen) with 40 mm\nDTT. The virus copy number was determined with qPCR.\n\nHuh7 and RLK cells grown in 96-well plates were washed twice with PBS\n(ThermoFisher Scientific) and incubated with neuraminidase from\nClostridium perfringens (Sigma) diluted in FBS-free growth\nmedium at 37 \u00b0C for 3 h. After the incubation, the cells were washed three\ntimes and challenged with MERS\u2013S- or HKU9\u2013S-pseudoviruses, with or\nwithout pre-incubation with the GRP78 polyclonal antibody (Abcam) for 1 h at 37\n\u00b0C. Fresh complete medium with 10% FBS was replaced at 18 h post-infection.\nPseudovirus entry was quantified using a microplate reader (Beckman DTX880) as\nRLU at 72 h post-infection.\n\nImmunostaining for flow cytometry was performed following standard procedures as\nwe previously described (61). To\ndetermine the surface-expression level of GRP78 and DPP4, the cells were\ndetached with 10 mm EDTA in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, followed\nby immunolabeling with antibodies against GRP78 (Abcam, 21685) or DPP4 (Abcam,\n28340) without cell permeabilization. For experiments with intracellular\nstainings, cells were detached with 10 mm EDTA in PBS, fixed in 4%\nparaformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The flow\ncytometry was performed using a FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences),\nand data were analyzed using FlowJo version X (Tree Star).\n\nAD293 and BHK21 cells were transfected with pcDNA\u2013GRP78\u2013V5 with\nLipofectamine 3000 (ThermoFisher Scientific). The transfected cells were\ninoculated with MERS-CoV at 48 h post- transfection. To determine virus entry,\nthe cells were inoculated with MERS-CoV at 5 m.o.i. at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h. After\n2 h, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated for another 4 h. At 6 h\npost-infection, the cells were washed extensively with PBS, fixed in 4%\nparaformaldehyde, and immunolabeled for flow cytometry. To determine virus\nattachment, the cells were inoculated with MERS-CoV at 15 m.o.i. at 4 \u00b0C\nfor 2 h. After 2 h, the cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4%\nparaformaldehyde, and immunolabeled for flow cytometry.\n\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of\nHong Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster. Normal human lung sections\nwere deparaffinized and rehydrated following standard procedures. Antigen\nunmasking was performed by boiling tissue sections with the antigen unmasking\nsolution from Vector Laboratories. Goat anti-DPP4 was obtained from R&D\nSystems (AF1180) and rabbit anti-GRP78 was obtained from Abcam (ab21685). Cell\nnuclei were labeled with the DAPI nucleic acid stain from ThermoFisher\nScientific (D21490). Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies were obtained from\nThermoFisher Scientific. Mounting was performed with the Vectashield mounting\nmedium (Vector Laboratories). Images were acquired with a Carl Zeiss LSM 710\nsystem.\n\nData on figures represent the means and standard deviations.
