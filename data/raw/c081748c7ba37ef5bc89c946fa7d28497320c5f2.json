{"title": "Experimental and natural infections in MyD88-and IRAK-4- deficient mice and humans NIH Public Access", "body": "MyD88 was first described as a \"macrophage differentiation marker\" for which mRNA accumulated in murine M1 myeloleukemic cells upon activation with IL-6 [1, 2] . Human MYD88 maps to chromosome 3p22-p21. 3 and contains five exons [1] . The full-length cDNA for human MYD88 encodes 296 amino acids forming a 33 kDa protein [2] . Murine Myd88 maps to chromosome 9q119. It also has five exons and the full-length cDNA encodes 296 amino acids forming a 33 kDa protein. The MyD88 protein includes an Nterminal \"death domain\" (DD) and a C-terminal Toll-interleukin receptor (TIR)-domain, similar to the intracellular domains of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and members of the interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) superfamily, collectively referred to as TIR receptors [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Human IRAK4 maps to chromosome 12q12 and contains 13 exons. The full-length cDNA for human IRAK-4 encodes 460 amino acids, forming a 52 kDa protein. The murine Irak4 gene maps to chromosome 15q94 and also contains 13 exons. The corresponding full-length cDNA encodes 459 amino acids, forming a 52 kDa protein. The IRAK-4 protein contains an N-terminal DD and a central kinase domain (KD) [7] .\n\nMyD88 and IRAK-4 are essential for signaling via all TLRs with the exception of TLR3 and, to some extent, TLR4, and for signaling via most IL-1Rs, including IL-1R1, IL-18R and IL-33R (ST2) [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Following its activation, MyD88 binds to the IL-1Rs and TLRs via its TIR domain, forming an oligomer; it then recruits IRAK-4 to the receptor via its DD [5, [18] [19] [20] [21] , mediating the activation of various transcription factors, including IRF5 and IRF7, AP-1 and NF-\u03baB, depending in part on the cell type and the cell surface receptor stimulated [22] (see figure 1 ). Thus, TIR-MyD88-IRAK-4-mediated signaling appears to be important for the innate recognition of pathogens and the ignition of inflammation, and, as such, is indispensable for the induction of protective immunity.\n\nHowever, most demonstrations of the importance of TIR-MyD88-IRAK-4-dependent pathways for protective immunity have been based on studies of experimental infections in mice in which protective immunity against a broad range of infectious agents has been shown; however, the essential nature of the role of TIR signaling in such broad-ranging immunity has been called into question by both clinical genetic and evolutionary genetic studies [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . In particular, the identification of human IRAK-4 and MyD88 deficiencies as immunological and clinical phenocopies has provided considerable insights [29, 30] . Detailed immunological and clinical descriptions of a large cohort of patients with these deficiencies have led to a reassessment of the importance of the TIR-MyD88-IRAK-4dependent pathway for general protective immunity in humans under natural conditions [31].\n\nMyd88-deficient mice are known to be susceptible to experimental infections with 45 pathogens: 27 bacteria [32-77], eight viruses [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] , seven protozoa [92] [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] , and four fungi [108] [109] [110] [111] [112] [113] . Enhanced pathogen growth in Myd88-deficient mice has been observed for: vi. Four fungi: Aspergillus after i.v. infection [108] , Candida albicans after i.v or intragastric injection [108, 109, 112] , Cryptococcus neoformans after i.n. inoculation or i.p. injection [110, 111] , Paracoccidioides brasiliensis after i.t.\n\ninoculation [113] (see Table 1 ).\n\nIRAK-4-deficient mice showed enhanced pathogen growth when challenged with Staphylococcus aureus i.p. [17] .\n\nAs greater pathogen growth in vivo is not always correlated with lower levels of survival, we consider here the published mortality data for experimental infections of MyD88deficient mice. Mortality due to experimental infections was greater in MyD88-deficient mice than in wild-type mice for 33 pathogens: [110, 111] , Paracoccidioides brasiliensis after i.t.\n\ninoculation [113] (see Table 2 ).\n\nIRAK-4-deficient mice displayed lower levels of survival than wild-type mice following i.p. challenge with Staphylococcus aureus [17] .\n\nThe initial description of human IRAK-4 deficiency was based on three patients [29] and that of human MyD88 deficiency was based on nine patients [30] . These patients all carried either homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations of the IRAK4 or MYD88 gene that lead to nonfunctional proteins [29, 30] . Given these small numbers of patients, only brief preliminary conclusions could be made concerning the infectious phenotype associated with the absence of MyD88-IRAK-4-dependent signaling. The cumulative evidence from the large number of case reports since published and from the comprehensive description of a cohort of 76 patients (52 with IRAK-4 deficiency and 24 with MyD88 deficiency) allow firmer conclusions about the infectious phenotype in the absence of MyD88-IRAK-4dependent signaling to be drawn [31, [114] [115] [116] [117] [118] [119] [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] [126] [127] [128] [129] . There are also an additional five patients with IRAK-4 deficiency and two patients with MyD88 deficiency for whom no data have yet been published. The infectious phenotype of MyD88-and IRAK-4-deficient patients is dominated by invasive pyogenic infections. The most frequent of such infections are meningitis, sepsis, arthritis and osteomyelitis, and the principal bacteria isolated in cases of invasive infection are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudmomonas aeruginosa (for a list of all the pathogens isolated from Myd88-and IRAK-4-deficient patients, see Table 3 ). These patients also typically suffer from deep tissue infections of the upper respiratory tract, such as severe tonsillitis due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in particular, and superficial skin infections, mostly caused by Staphylococcus aureus. We cannot rule out the possibility that the predominance of Gram-positive bacteria in patients with MyD88 and IRAK-4 deficiencies results at least in part from a patient recruitment bias. No patients with these deficiencies have yet been identified on the Indian subcontinent, in South America or in China. Patients with MyD88-or IRAK-4-deficiencies in these areas of the world might perhaps present a higher frequency of infections with Gram-negative bacteria, as suggested by case reports of invasive infection with Shigella spp.\n\nduring endemic diarrhea outbreaks [119, 127] . However, by contrast to this uncertainty concerning positive associations about the infectious phenotype, we can highlight much more emphatically the negative associations drawn concerning the roles of MyD88 and IRAK-4 in host anti-pathogen defense. Most, if not all, of the 76 patients identified to date have been exposed to mycobacteria, viruses, Toxoplasma, Pneumocystis and other fungi, but none of these pathogens caused invasive infection. This strongly suggests that MyD88 and IRAK-4 are dispensable in humans for defense against these pathogens, contrary to expectations based on the results obtained in the mouse model [31] . \n\nThe notion that TLR-and IL-1R-mediated innate immune recognition is indispensable for survival and protective defense against many pathogens -based largely on findings in mouse models of experimental infections -should be reconsidered in light of the naturally occurring infections in humans with MyD88-or IRAK-4-deficiency. By contrast to the broad susceptibility of MyD88-deficient mice to 46 different bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi (i.e. to almost nearly all the microbes tested), patients with MyD88-or IRAK-4deficiencies are susceptible to invasive and non-invasive infections with only a few Grampositive and Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, MyD88-IRAK-4-mediated TLR and IL-1R immunity is undoubtedly vital in infancy and early childhood, but gradually becomes dispensable, from adolescence onwards. Overall, MyD88-dependent TLR and IL-1R immunity is vital in both mice and humans, but its role in the course of naturally occurring infections in humans seems to be much more restricted than initially inferred from experimental infections in mice, as humans lacking functional MyD88 or IRAK-4 proteins are susceptible to a narrow range of pathogens, and only in infancy and early childhood. The different outcomes between experimental infections in mice and natural infections in humans may be due to species-specific differences, or more likely to differences in the modes of infection. In that regard, the study of naturally occurring infections in MyD88-and IRAK-4-deficient mice would be insightful, as suggested by preliminary studies [132] . In any case, the studies of MyD88-and IRAK4-deficient humans neatly illustrate the value of dissecting inborn errors of immunity underlying pediatric infectious diseases for deciphering the redundant and non-redundant roles of host defense genes in natura [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] .\n\nImmunological redundancy is greater in the course of natural infections in outbred human populations than in the course of experimental infections in inbred mice. Genetic studies of this type will facilitate the burgeoning, long-awaited investigation of the contribution of immunity to health and disease in humans [131] [132] [133] . The TIR superfamily (TLRs/IL-1Rs) is dependent on MyD88 and IRAK-4 signaling for its regulation of gene transcription. MyD88 and IRAK-4 control IRF (Interferon regulatory factors), MAPK (Map Kinases) and NEMO (NF-\u03baB essential modulator) which regulate AP-1 and NF-\u03baB (p50/p65); the latter by stimulating the phosphorylation and degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 so releasing NF-\u03baB from the inactive NF-\u03baB/I\u03baB\u03b1 complex. MyD88 also controls IRF5 and IRF7 dependent signaling (not shown). 46 pathogens displaying higher growth rates in vivo in MyD88-deficient mice than in wild-type controls, in experimental conditions.
