{"title": "Archives of Virology Detection of Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus Neutralisin 9 Antibody in Cats", "body": "High titres of neutralising activity to transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a porcine coronavirus, were found in sera and peritoneal fluids from eats infected with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). A small proportion of cats, from a hospital population unaffected by FIP, also had neutralising activity. Procedures to remove non-specific viral inhibitors, including treatment by heat inactivation, trypsin, sulphydryl reagent and kaolin absorption were unsuccessful. The active component was unable to neutralise another porcine coronavirus, haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus or the porcine entgrovirus, Talfan. Gel filtration of feline sera and peritoneal fluid demonstrated high levels of the neutralising activity in the area corresponding to 7 S IgG, which could be removed by absorption with specific anti-IgG serum and these properties are suggested to be consistent with those of antibody. These findings impty that there is a coronavirus in cats which is antigenically related to TGEV and its possible nature is discussed.\n\nTransmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is an established member of the Coronaviridae (17) and infection of pigs with this virus produces specific neutralising antibody in serum. Infection of dogs with the recently described canine eoronavirus (1) or TGEV (5, 10) will produce serum antibody which can neutratise TGEV (2) . A serological relationship to TGEV has not been established for any other eoronavirus. It has recently been published that the agent causing feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a coronavirus (6, 12) .\n\nThis report describes TGEV neutralising activity found in samples of serum and peritoneal fluid from normal and FIP-infected cats.

All serum a n d peritoneal fluid samples used were h e a t e d at 56 \u00b0 C for 30 m i n u t e s to i n a c t i v a t e complem e n t . However, as some non-specific viral i n h i b i t o r s a n d antibodies are n o t affected b y this t r e a t m e n t , selected sera a n d p e r i t o n e a l fluids were also i n a c t i v a t e d a t 60 \u00b0 C for 30 minutes, or 65 \u00b0 C for 20 minutes. If trypsin t r e a t m e n t was used in addition to heat treatment, 0.2 ml of 0.25 per cent trypsin, p i t 8.5 was added to 0.05 ml of sample. This m i x t u r e was then heated at 60 \u00b0 C for 30 minutes before neutralising activity was assayed. T r e a t m e n t of sera and peritoneal fluids with kaolin was carried out as described by J o o et al. (7) .\n\nSera and peritoneal fluids were treated with the sulphydryl reagent 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT) to destroy macroglobulins. Samples diluted in 50 msi Tris HC1 0.1 ~I NaC1 p i t 8.0 were treated with 10 mM or 1 m~ D T T at room temperature for one hour. They were t h e n alkylated with iodoacetamide, at a final concentration of 1 m~, for 20 minutes. Overnight dialysis was carried out before assaying for T G E V neutralising activity, or haemagglutination of h u m a n '0' erythrocytes.\n\nSamples of sera and peritoneal fluids with detectable levels of T G E V neutralising a c t i v i t y were assayed for interferon-like substances. Suspensions of A P T / 2 or APT/92 cells were incubated for 24 hours at 37 \u00b0 C with serial dilutions of test samples. The culture fluids were then removed, fresh medium containing viral inoculum added and end points read after 4 days as described for the microtitrc neutralisation test.\n\nSerum and peritoneal fluids were treated with 40 per cent saturated a m m o n i u m sulphate for 4 hours at 4 o C. The precipitate was deposited by centrifugation at 15,000 \u00d7 g for 20 minutes. Supernatant fluid was withdrawn and the precipitate dissolved in distilled water, to originM volume. All samples were then diMysed overnight against 0.85 per cent NaC1 and assayed for T G E V neutralising activity as before.\n\nThe gel filtration system used by SA~F et al. (15) was followed to deteimaine the a p p r o x i m a t e molecular size of the neutralising component. Sephadex G-200 (Pharraacia, Uppsala, Sweden) was packed in two columns arranged in series. I n the first column (measuring 2.5 \u00d7 45 cm) the direction of flow was descending and in the second (measuring 3.2 \u00d7 85 era) flow was ascending.\n\nSample volumes of 3 to 5 ml were applied to the column and eluted with 0.1 ~: Tris HC1 0.2 ~ NaCI p H 8.0; 3.0 ml fractions were collected at a flow rate of 8 --1 0 ml per hour and their optical density at 280 n m was measured. Selected fractions were pooled and concentrated by a factor of 25 using Minicon B-15 concentrators (Amicon Ltd., High Wycombe, Bucks) and the product assayed for neutralising activity. Pooled fractions were incubated for 20 hours at room temperature, with monospecific sheep anti-cat IgG serum (this serum had a neutralisation titre for T G E V of less t h a n 2). The precipitate formed was removed by eent~fugation at 7 0 0 \u00d7 g for l0 minutes and the supernatant fluid was assayed for neutralising activity. Immunoelectrophoresis of samples before and after adsorption was performed using\" 1 per cent, agarose gels in 0.1 N sodium barbital buffer at p H 8.6. Table 2 shows that 11 out of 12 had a positive TGEV neutralising test. Negative :results were obtained with peritoneal fluids from two colony cats which had no lesions of FIP at postmortem and also three peritoneal fluids obtained from normal eats in the general population and one from an FIP case which occurred outside the colony. Serum, pleural and peritoneal fluids from one FIP case had comparable titres as shown in Table 3 . Likewise coagulated and heparinised samples gave similar results. Serum sample 1 was taken from a cat with clinical FIP. Samples 2, 3 and 4 were obtained from the case post-mortem, one week lager\n\nThe specificity of the TGEV neutralising activity in feline sera and peritoneal fluids was first investigated by testing them with ttEV and Talfan virus. As shown in Table 4 , all the samples tested failed to neutralise either virus. They did inhibit haemagg]utination by HEV but this was eliminated by absorption with kaolin. Control antisera to TGEV, H E V a n d Talfan virus failed to neutralise the heterologous viruses. \n\nThe heat stability of the neutralising factor was tested and compared with T G E V h y p e r i m m u n e porcine antiserum (PS 713). Table 5 shows some reduction in. titre at 60 \u00b0 C for PS 713 a n d one peritoneal fluid b u t no more at, 65 \u00b0 C for PS 713, feline serum or peritoneal fluids. Trypsin t r e a t m e n t had little further significant effect on samples t h a n heat inactivation at 60 \u00b0 C alone. The results of kaolin t r e a t m e n t of sera was unpredictable as at times i m m u n oglobulin was removed as well as non-specific inhibitors. For example, the t r e a t m e n t of u n d i l u t e d PS 713 reduced the a n t i b o d y titre from 4,500 to 573 (Table 6 ) and of diluted PS 713 reduced the a n t i b o d y titre to below 80. The effect of kaolin adsorption on the neutralising titre of peritoneal fluid 61 was less t h a n t h a t of PS 713. Table 4 shows t h a t kaolin was completely effective in removing inhibitors of H E V haemagglutination.\n\nThe results of treating PS 713 and two of the feline peritoneal fluids with D T T are also shown in Table 6 . W i t h i n a range of one doubling dilution, the three 82 D . J . REYNOLDS, D. J. GARWES, a n d C. J. GASKELL: samples were unaffected by either concentration of DTT. The haemaggtutination titre of bovine serum J625 was reduced 50 fold by 1 mM DTT.\n\nAll samples were assayed for interferon-like activity, by pretreatment of both APT/2 cells and the APT/92 cell line; no activity was found. \n\nThe neutralising factor in feline samples was completely precipitated with 40 per cent saturated ammonium sulphate. Furthermore, centrifugation of untreated samples under the conditions used to collect the ammonium sulphate precipitate did not alter the neutralising titre. In addition no activity was detected in the concentrated dialysate.\n\nGel Filtration Gel filtration produced three peaks of protein (Figs. 1, 2, 3) Figure 1 . Maximum neutralising antibody concentration was found to coincide with the second protein peak. Lower level activity was found in the first peak and in the trough between the first and second peaks. These higher molecular weight neutralising components probably correspond to 7 S IgG complexes, IgA or IgM. Feline serum and peritoneal fluid from FIP infected cats showed similar profiles. The optical density of the second peak was extremely high in FIP cases as a result of hypergammaglobulinaemia, a characteristic of the disease. This peak contained high levels of neutralising activity in both serum and peritoneal fluids as shown in Figures 2 and 3 . Very little activity was found in the first peak region and it was not affected by DTT. No activity was found in the third peak. Pooled fractions from the second peaks of both feline serum and peritoneal fluid were adsorbed with sheep anti-cat IgG. Before adsorption immunoeleetrophoresis of both samples (Fig. 4) showed a single precipitin arc of IgG, using sheep anti-eat IgG as precipitating antiserum. TGEV neutralising titres of 2,825 for fehne serum and 710 for peritoneal fluid were recorded. However, after adsorption both titres were reduced to less than 20 and the IgG preeipitin lines were lost completely. \n\nThis report shows that sera and peritoneal fluids from cats affected with F I P neutralise TGEV in vitro. The active component was not destroyed by heating at 56 \u00b0, 60 o or 65 \u00b0 C and trypsin treatment had little effect. DTT did not destroy the TGEV neutralising activity, although it was shown to be fully effective under the conditions used, by the effect on the IgM in the bovine serum tested. Thus the aetivity demonstrated ia feline fluids was unJikely to be a macroglobulin. Feline sera and peritoneal fluids were not more affected by kaolin absorption than specific antibody. Most non-specific inhibitors, such as that described for avian infectious bronchitis virus (9) , are affected by one or more of these methods. As pretreatment of cells was not effective it is unlikely that the activity was mediated by interferonlike substanees. The range of action of the neutralising activity did not include HEV, which is antigenically dissimilar to TGEV and is not related by erossneutralisatiom Talfan virus, a porcine enterovirus, was not affected.\n\nGel filtration studies demonstrated that the activity predominated in the gamma globulin fraction. The highest neutralising titre was found in the area corresponding to 7 S IgG and indicates that the neutralising activity may well be alltihody; in addition, specific removal of IgG by adsorption, which was confirmed by immnnoelectrophoresis, completely removed the neutralising activity for TGEV. The patterns of neutralising activity in Figures 2 and 3 correspond well to that shown for an inhibitor in bovine serum for respiratory syncytial virus (3). This inhibition was shown subsequently to be antibody when bovine respiratory syneytial virus was isolated as the corresponding antigen.\n\nThe high levels of gamma globulin in sera and peritoneal fluids from F I P cases are commonly found associated with this disease (4) . Assuming that the T G E V neutralising activity in feline sera is due to specific immunoglobulin, the data presented do not demonstrate whether the high levels found in F I P cases are due to generalised stimulation of g a m m a globulin production or to a specific immune response to a related antigen associated with FIP.\n\nA virus associated w-ith F I P is the only feline coronavirus described in the literature. I t m a y be serologically related to TGEV as is the canine enteric coronavirus, t{eeent evidence (I2) suggests that antibody to F I P is more widely spread in the feline population than the clinical disease itself. Thus the occurrence of anti-T G E V activity in apparently uninfected cats does not rule out an association with F I P . Definite evidence of this association is yet to be established. There could be a separate eoronavirus, not isolated, responsible for this activity and a further investigation of this possibility is in progress.\n\nThe finding that some cats have antibodies capable of neutralising T G E V is of interest in epidemiological studies of TGEV in pigs. i t indicates that serum neutralising titres to T G E V cannot be used to demonstrate whether cats could act as carriers of the disease. The same problem has been encountered in studies on the role of dogs in the spread of TGEV. Comparative work on the nature of the coronaviral antigens and the serum antibody response to them in various species, is currently in progress."}
