Still, there is growing 34 awareness that viruses as biological replicators are subjected to ecological sorting and so 35 require a viable propagation strategy. In the current analysis I depart from the precept that 36 virus fitness hinges on the virus transmission success. I examine the transmission ecologies 37 of the world main livestock viruses, 36 in total, a collection of pathogens well described in 38 terms of the organ system involvement, infection course, the extent of host damage, virus 39 shedding profile, and virus transmission modes. The viruses are on this basis ranked in an 40 outer-to inner-body fashion, virtually. As a next step, this ranking is disentangled with a 41 view to contrast two main host ecologies, poultry plus pig production and ruminant plus 42 equine husbandry, as well as to create a distinction among the RNA, DNA and retrovirus in 43 the study. The matches among these various virus traits serve to establish the outer-to 44 inner-body shifts in the interplay of host environment, virus-host interactions, and nature of Introduction 48 Increasingly, viruses are viewed in an ecological context, as living entities [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . Viruses, 49 like all biological replicators, form a continuum along the selfishness-cooperativity axis, from 50 the completely selfish to fully cooperative forms [6] . In a deeper sense, the history of life is a 51 story of parasite-host coevolution that includes both the incessant arms race and various 52 forms of cooperation [7] . 53 Organ systems and virus transmission success 54 The current paper approaches the evolution of viral replication and propagation strategies [11] . 80 The study 81 The study explores the transmission ecology of the world main livestock viruses, 36 in total, 82 a collection of well described pathogens. Viruses are ranked in an outer-to inner-body 83 fashion, virtually, on the basis of the shifting organ system involvement, transmission 84 modes, and infection-shedding-transmission related variables. Next, this virus infiltration 85 ranking is disentangled to contrast the poultry plus pig to the ruminant plus equine viruses, 86 as well as to separately consider the RNA, DNA and retroviruses in the study, also ranked in 87 an outer-to inner-body fashion. 94 As a first step, the one-to-three scores allocated to the 36 livestock viruses for the four 95 ecological variables were matched on the basis of Spearman correlation, see also S2 Fig reflects, respectively, acute, acute and persistent, and persistent infections. Likewise, the 589 score for the infection severity level concerns a case fatality of less than one, one to ten, and 590 above ten percent. The score for the virus environmental survival rate refers to the number 591 of days that the virus remains infective outside the host body, ranging from up to three, 592 three to ten, to over ten days.
