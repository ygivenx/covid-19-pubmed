{"title": "Archives of Virology Experimental Infeetion of Adult Axenie Rats With Parker's Rat Coronavirus", "body": "Coronavirus infection is common in laboratory rats and two antigenically related viruses, sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) and Parker's rat coronavirus (PRCV), have been isolated from naturally-infected rats (2, 7) . SDAV causes severe self-limiting sialodacryoadenitis in naturally-infected or experimentallyinoculated adult rats (4, 5) and recent evidence indicates that SDAV is associated with naturally-occurring keratoeonjunetivitis in rats (6) . PRCV was originally isolated from the lungs of rats with a high incidence of complement-fixing (CF) 34:6 P.N. BHA~'T and R. 0. JACOB\u00a5: antibody to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (7) . In contrast to SDAV, natural infection with PRCV is reportedly asymptomatic in adults, but experimentallyinoculated neonates developed lethal interstitial pneumonia (7) . This report described experimental PRCV infection of adult CD rats. Results indicate that PRCV is pathogenic for the respiratory system.\n\nFifteen male and fifteen female, 9 to i0 week old, axenic caesarian-derived (CD) rats (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Wilmington, Mass.), 150-180 g in weight, were housed in sterile isolators and were fed sterile rat food and water ad libitum. Isolators were monitored for bacterial and fungal contamination by repeated sampling of feces, bedding and water bottles. They remained sterile throughout the experiment.\n\nSeed PRCV was obtained froln Dr. John C. Parker, Microbiological Associates, Det:hesda, Maryland. Virus stock was prepared by one passage in primary rat kidney (PRI~) cultures prepared from a germfree CD rat as previously described (2) . Aliquots of infected tissue culture fluid were stored at --60\u00b0C with equal volumes of fetal bovine serum (FBS). Unanesthetized rats were inoculated intranasally with 0.i ml of culture fluid containing 4.6 log10 TCIDs0 of PRCV. Culture fluid was removed from isolators immediately after inoculation and was retitered for infectious PRCV in PRK monolayers as previously described (2) .\n\nOn each of eight consecutive days after inoculation three to four rats, selected at random, were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium and exsanguinated. Serum was stored at --60 \u00b0 C. Sections of trachea, lung, cervical lymph node, submaxillary and parotid salivary glands and exorbital and IIarderian lacrimal glands were harvested aseptically and were frozen at --60 o C. Nasopharyngeal cavities were irrigated with sterile minimum essential medium in Hank's base containing 50 per cent FBS (MEMH-FBS) and washings were also frozen at --60 \u00b0 C. Tissues were homogenized (i0 per cent w/v) in MEMII-FBS and were clarified by lowspeed eentrifugation. Supernatants were serially diluted and inoculated into PI~K cultures. Observations for cytopathic effects were carried out as previously reported (2) and endpoints were calculated as described by REED and MVENCI~ (8) . Virus in lungs, tracheas, nasal washings, salivary glands and lacrimal glands was quantitated for individual rats. Lymph nodes were pooled by collection day before being titrated. AntLPI~CV immune serum and PRCV CF antigen were donated by Drs. John Parker and Michael Collins of Microbiological Associates, Bethesda. Serum neutralizing (SN) and CF antibody titers to SDAV and PRCV were determined as previously described (2) .\n\nSections of nasal turbinate, trachea, cervical lymph node, submaxillary and parotid salivary gland and exorbital and Ii[arderian lacrimal glands were snap frozen in dry icealcohol baths. Lungs were inflated with 7.5 per cent gelatin and placed at 0 \u00b0 C for one hour to gel, sliced and frozen on chucks at --20 \u00b0 C. Rat anti-SDAV IgG was prepared and atiquots were conjugated to fluoreseein isothiocyanate (3). Preliminary tests indicated that anti-SDAV and anti-PRCV sera gave equally good results for indirect immunofluoreseent staining of PtlCV-infeeted tissues. Goat anti-mouse globulinfluoreseein isothioeyanate (Lot AA 720073, Antibodies, Incorporated, Davis, California) was used with mouse anti-SDAV immune ascitie-fluid for indirect staining. Sections of snap frozen tissues 6 mm thick were fixed overnight in acetone at --20 \u00b0 C and were stained by the direct, and/or indirect, fluorescent antibody technic. They were examined with a Zeiss microscope fitted with an I{BO200 Osram 1amp, a BG-12 ultraviolet exciter filter and numbers 4:4 and 53 barrier filters.\n\nCoronal sections of nasopharynx at three levels and sections of trachea, lung (inflated with fixative via the trachea), cervical lymph node, sMivary glands, lacrimal glands, heart, thymus, liver, spleen, kidney, pancreas, adrenal gland, gonad, eye and brain were fixed in I0 per eent neutral buffered formalin, sectioned at 6 ~m, stained with hematoxylin-eosin and examined by light microscopy.\n\nRats were free of detectable clinical disease during the eight day experiment. PRCV was recovered from nasal washes and trachea by day one, from cervical lymph nodes by day two and from lung by day three (Fig. 1) . Titers were usually higher in trachea than in lung. Virus was rarely detected in salivary or lacrimal glands and was not found in serum. Virus was not detected in nasopharynx, trachea and lung a~ter day six and in other tissues after day seven except in ~he submaxillary salivary gland of one rat.\n\nIntracytoplasmic viral antigen was de~ected by immunofluorescence in epithelial cells of nasal mucosa by day two. Fluorescence was multifocal and persisted until day six when onty several small loci of antigen remained. Tracheal fluores- cence was sparse; a few mucosal epithelial cells contained viral antigen on days two through four. Fluorescence in lung was also sparse and was observed only on days six and seven. Antigen was not detected in parotid, submaxillary, exorbital and Itarderian glands or in cervical lymph nodes. Gross lesions were confined to lung, were seen on days six and seven and consisted of several small (less than 1 mm) red-brown to gray loci which were randomly dispersed over all lobes. A few lungs had patchy areas of pale red to gray discoloration on individual lobes, but the lobes were not firm.\n\nI-Iistologieally, lesions occurred primarily in the respiratory system and were first seen on day two as mild rhinitis. There was multifocal or segmental necrosis of respiratory epithelium covering nasal turbinates. The lamina propria was mildly edematous and contained lymphoc34es and a few neutrophils which occasionally infiltrated interstitial tissnes of underlying glands. Some meatuses contained neutrophils and cell debris. Similar lesions were fonnd through day four (Figs. 2, 3) although there was a relative increase in the proportion of neutrophils in the lamina propria and several necrotic aeini were seen among submueosal glands. Hyperplasia of paraseptal lymphoid tissue was noticed by day four, but germinal centers were not present.\n\nBy day five acute rhinitis was accompanied by mild nonsuppurative traeheitis. Tracheal lamina propria had infiltrates of lymphoid cells and some neutrophils. Neutrophils were also found in mucosal epithelium but epithelial necrosis was generally sparse. Occasionally inflammation was more severe and ineluded substantial necrosis of epithelium and tracheal glands.\n\nLung lesions began by day five as focal peribronehial lymphoid cell hyperplasia and mild focal interstitial pneumonia. Alveolar septae contained mononuclear cells and neutrophils and there were some inflammatory cells in adjacent (Figs. 4, 5) . By day six pneumocytes, foamy macrophages and edema fluid partially filled some alveoli, but lesions remained mild and focal. There were also traces of nonsuppurative perivasculitis in several lungs. Necrosis of bronchial epithelium was not observed. Nasopharyngeal and tracheal inflammation subsided by day seven and only traces of rhinitis remained by day eight. Pulmonary lesions were not detected on day eight. Salivary gland lesions were rare. Parotitis was found in two rats on day seven and submaxillary sialoadenitis was found in one rat on day eight. Lesions were Alveolar spaces contain a few macrophages identical to those caused by SDAV (4, 5) and were characterized by necrosis of salivary ducts with periductular and interstitial i n f l a m m a t o r y edema. There were no lesions in lacrimal glands, eye, liver, spleen, heart, kidney, thymus, cervical l y m p h node, adrenal gland, gonad, or brain. Anti-PI~CV a n d anti-SDAV neutralizing a n t i b o d y were detected by day six and seven, respectively (Table 1) . CF a n t i b o d y to P g C V and SDAV was not detected through day eight. \n\nParker and eoworkers previously demonstrated that PRCV caused lethal interstitial pneumonia in experimentally infected suckling rats and they suggested that PRCV could play a role in chronic respiratory disease of adult rats (7) . We extended their hypothesis to include SDAV by showing it was also a primary pathogen for the respiratory system of adu]t rats (4) . Experiments reported here show diree~ty that PRCV infection of adult rats, although asymptomatie, causes enough inflammation of the respiratory tract to warrant continued scrutiny as an initiator or eopathogen in clinically severe respiratory-syndromes.\n\nIt is clear that PRCV and SDAV are closely related viruses. Their antigenic similarity has been well documented, but in cross neutralization tests titers to the homologous virus were persistently higher than to the heterologous virus (2) . Similar results were obtained in the present experiment where PRCV-infeeted rats had SN antibody to PRCV by day six and slightly lower SN titers to SDAV by day seven.\n\nIt is of interest in this regard that PRCV and SDAV were originally isolated from lungs of Fisher rats and salivary glands of CD Sprague Dawley rats, respectively. These rats were raised in different rooms of the same animal facility.\n\nStrains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (Coronavirus) differ in their pathogenicity and tissue tropism although they are closely related serologieally (1). Our findings indicate that the relationship between SDAV and PRCV is similar to that among MItV strains. Therefore, we propose that SDAV and PRCV be considered different strains of rat eoronavirus.\n\nWhen the pathobiology of SDAV (4) and PI~CV infection in vivo is compared, additional differences emerge (Table 2) . First, clinical signs of rhinitis and sialo- Up to eight days post inoculation CF antibody can develop if rats are tested at later times dacryoadenitis were observed frequently during experimental SDAV infection whereas PRCV infection in rats of the same strain and of the same age and source was asymptomatie. Second, the tissue tropism of PI~CV differed from SDAV. Both viruses replicated in the respiratory tract and caused rhinotraeheitis but PRCV also caused mild pneumonia whereas SDAV did not. Conversely, PRCV replicated poorly in salivary and lacrimal glands and only rarely produced lesions, whereas SDAV was severely pathogenic for these glands. Nevertheless, sialoadenitis produced by PRCV, although mild when it occurred, was morphologically compatible with SDAV-induced lesions. The potential for Pl~CV-induced sialoadenitis may be mitigated by factors such as strain, age and sex of the host. Additional experiments should examine the effects these variables ha,~e on eoronavirus infections of rats. This study also underscores the usefulness of documenting and correlating virological and morphological data to assess the pathogenetie significance of infections which are clinically silent and which are usually detected only by serological monitoring."}
