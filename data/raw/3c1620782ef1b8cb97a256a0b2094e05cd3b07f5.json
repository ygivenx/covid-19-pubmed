In some cases, humans serve as a reservoir for the viruses and the link to human disease is clear cut. In other cases, humans may be incidental hosts or the link to disease may be more tenuous. Table 201 -3 lists specific viruses within each family that are linked to human disease.\n\nFacilitated by advances in molecular methods, the discovery of new viruses and more careful characterization of known viruses 6, 7 have resulted in frequent changes in family taxonomy. Some examples of such changes include: (1) de novo creation of a virus family (e.g., Anelloviridae); 8 (2) splitting a new family off of an existing one (e.g., Hepeviridae from Caliciviridae); 9 (3) dividing a family into two new families (e.g., Papovaviridae into Papillomaviridae and Polyomaviridae); 10 and (4) uniting formerly separate families (e.g., the incorporation of Toroviridae into Coronaviridae). 11, 12 Working groups 13 within the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) 14 have the responsibility of approving new names and making changes in classification. Figures 201-1 , 201-2, and 201-3 illustrate the relationships between human virus families in terms of key biologic criteria listed in Table 201-1. Families hierarchically are subdivided in a variety of ways including into subfamilies (suffix -virinae), genera (suffix -virus), and species (suffix -virus). 15 In the past, the conventions for naming species were somewhat arbitrary and varied from family to family. The ICTV has instituted a more uniform system. A virus species, as defined by van Regenmortel, is \"a polythetic class of viruses that constitutes a replicating lineage and occupies a particular ecologic niche.\" 16 Polythetic refers to the fact that viruses grouped within a species share many but not all properties in common. Species criteria may include genetic structure, sequence homology, host range, tissue tropism, biological reservoir, route of transmission, immunologic cross-reactivity, epidemiology, and pathogenicity. 17 With the advent of rapid nucleic acid sequencing, sequence homology has taken precedence over other species classification criteria. 18 The current system of species classification does not always correspond to common usage or historical concepts of viral species. For example, the three immunologically distinct viruses targeted by the trivalent poliovirus vaccine are now considered to be the 1 This family of viruses has been assigned to the Herpesvirales order of viruses. 2 Parvoviruses vary in the percentage of positive and negative sense ssDNA genomes that are packaged, depending on the genus. 3 Anelloviruses package negative sense ssDNA genomes. This is the strand that will be transcribed into mRNA. 19, 20 This species includes at least 18 additional serotypes with diverse clinical presentations. 20a The practicality of distinguishing such serotypes is emphasized by the eradication of wild poliovirus type 2 in 2000. 21 Species can be subdivided further into groups, clades, types, subtypes, serotypes, variants, and isolates -depending on the family involved and the degree of similarity. Selected representatives called \"type viruses\" may be used to illustrate the properties of a particular taxon.\n\nA number of virus families now are assigned to higher level \"orders\" designated with the suffix -virales. Examples are Herpesvirales, Mononegavirales, Picornavirales, and Nidovirales. 22 These are indicated by footnotes in Table 201 -2. Most families currently are unassigned to orders.\n\nAll references are available online at www.expertconsult.com and double-stranded RNA viruses. The chart groups the families using the structure of the genome, presence or absence of an envelope, and the presence or absence of ambisense gene expression. For segmented viruses, the number of genome segments is listed in parentheses. 1 This group of virus families is assigned to the Mononegavirales (for monosegmented, negative stranded, order of viruses) order of viruses. 2 \"Floating genus\" -This genus is not currently assigned to a viral family. It bears some similarities to viroid pathogens of plants. 3 Satellite virus refers to the fact that hepatitis D virus (HDV) is dependent upon HBV, a genomically unrelated virus for its successful replication. contagiosum, HSV-1 \u2022 Sexual: e.g., HIV-1, HTLV-1, HBV, HPV 16 &18, HSV-2 \u2022 Urine-associated: e.g., CMV \u2022 Parenteral (blood and blood products, transplantation, tattooing, and scarification): e.g., HIV-1, HBV, HCV \u2022 Animal bite: e.g., rabies virus \u2022 Vertical (germline, intrauterine, perinatal, human milk): e.g.\n\nHIV-1, HTLV-1, germline transmission of endogenous retroviruses \u2022 Arthropod-borne (mosquitos, ticks, sandflies): e.g., Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, dengue virus, yellow fever virus, and many others \u2022 Rodent-associated: e.g., lassa fever virus, sin nombre and other hanta viruses \u2022 Bat-associated transmission: e.g., rabies virus, Nipah virus, Ebola virus, SARS CoV \u2022 Monkey associated: e.g., herpes B virus, monkeypox virus, orf virus \u2022 Other zoonotic associations (cows, sheep, etc.): e.g., orf virus, cowpox virus\n\nIn addition to biologic classification, viruses often are categorized according to their clinical presentation (syndromic classification), epidemiology, or mode of transmission. Box 201-1 lists the major routes of transmission in humans, with representative examples of viruses transmitted by each route.\n\nUnderstanding viral classification can lead to important generalizations regarding the prevention and treatment of viral infection as well as insights into the distribution and evolution of viruses."}
