{"title": "Pre-Travel Medical Preparation of Business and Occupational Travelers", "body": "GTEN is a consortium of US medical practices that includes academic institutions, health maintenance organizations, pharmacy-based clinics, and public health clinics that provide pre-travel health consultations to international travelers; it is described in detail elsewhere.8 In brief, GTEN collects data from pre-travel consultations of international travelers visiting consortium sites. This data collection began in January 2009 and is ongoing; data collected from 18 clinics from January 2009 through December 2012 were used for this analysis. Human Subjects Advisors at each participating site reviewed and approved or exempted the collection and subsequent analyses of the de-identified data.\n\nGTEN data are collected using a secure online tool, which creates an individual traveler medical note and provides guidance to the health care provider on the latest recommendations published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Travelers self-reported, into the tool, their sex, age, country of birth, purpose of travel, destinations, itinerary-related details, reasons for seeking the pre-travel consultation, medications, and medical conditions. Anyone born in the 50 US states or US Virgin Islands was considered \u201cUS born.\u201d Health care providers verified the information provided by the traveler and also recorded the patient's previous vaccination status, vaccinations and chemoprophylaxis that were recommended, and health education that was provided. If a recommended vaccination was not given, the provider was prompted to give a reason for non-vaccination, including the following: vaccine was not available, insufficient time for completion before departure, patient declined, referral to primary care provider for administration, or medical contraindication. For rabies vaccine, clinicians were prompted to provide a reason if the vaccine was not recommended for those traveling for longer than 1 month (defined as 28 days).\n\nWe evaluated the proportion of GTEN travelers vaccinated for the following diseases: measles, mumps, rubella (MMR); hepatitis B; influenza; varicella; tetanus; hepatitis A; yellow fever (YF); typhoid; rabies; meningococcal; polio; and Japanese encephalitis (JE). For this analysis, MMR, influenza, varicella and tetanus vaccines were defined as generally recommended for all travelers before departure if they were not already immune. The proportion of travelers vaccinated for hepatitis A, hepatitis B ,and typhoid was assessed for specific groups going to endemic countries (high- and intermediate-risk countries for hepatitis A and B; high-risk countries for typhoid) based on the most current CDC recommendations available at the time of the consultation.9,10 The proportion of travelers vaccinated for polio, rabies, meningococcal disease, JE, and YF was assessed for specific groups of at-risk travelers who met criteria (eg, destination country with risk, season with risk, duration of stay, or indicated for the itinerary) for recommended vaccination; a more extensive description of travelers who were considered at risk is available elsewhere.11 For all vaccines, if the clinician indicated existing immunity or if the traveler received at least the first dose of a vaccine series at the pre-travel consultation, the traveler was considered, for this analysis, vaccinated for that disease. To analyze reasons for non-vaccination, we excluded those who were previously immune, were vaccinated at the clinic visit, or for whom information was not known.\n\nTo accurately evaluate the trip duration and activities, only travelers with one purpose of travel and one itinerary were included. Travelers younger than 18 years were excluded from all analyses because they are less likely to travel for business or other occupational reasons, and legally do not make the primary decisions regarding their health care.\n\nTravelers self-defined their purpose of travel; those who selected business as their purpose of travel were classified as business travelers. We also considered the following purposes of travel to be occupational: providing medical care, providing non-medical service work, participating in missionary work, and taking part in research/education. Non-occupational travelers were classified as those traveling for leisure or those visiting friends and relatives. In accordance with the CDC definition, those VFRs were defined as those who selected their reason of travel as \u201creturning to region of origin of self or family to visit friends and relatives\u201d and who were visiting at least one United Nations Human Development Index low- or low\u2013middle-income country.12 Other purposes of travel collected by the GTEN tool, including military deployment, receiving medical care, adoption, adventure, attending large gatherings or events, and other, were excluded from the analysis.\n\nWe conducted two analyses: (1) a general description of business and all other occupational travelers in GTEN, and (2) a comparison of business travelers to those traveling for non-occupational purposes (leisure and VFR). We analyzed all data by using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). For bivariate analyses of categorical variables between business travelers and leisure (or VFR) travelers, random intercept models were used with clinic site as the random effect to account for possible between-clinic variation and Morel, Bokossa, and Neerchal adjustment to correct for the small number of sites.13 Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for comparative analyses of continuous variables. A two-sided P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nMost (more than 59%) of the occupational travelers, except for business (39%), were women (Table 1). Among all occupational travelers, missionaries and non-medical service workers sought pre-travel care further in advance of their departure date, with median times to departure of 33 and 32 days, respectively. Business travelers had the shortest time to departure (median 15 days). Most business travelers (52%) indicated that their employer suggested they make the pre-travel health appointment, but most other occupational travelers reported that being concerned about health issues related to travel had prompted them to make a pre-travel health appointment.\n\nIndia was the top destination both for business (24%) and research/education (9%) travelers. China (7%) and South Africa (4%) were the other two most commonly visited destinations for business travelers. Although Haiti was selected by most of those providing medical care (20%) and missionaries (15%), Honduras was most common for non-medical service workers (14%). (It should be noted that a large earthquake occurred in Haiti in 2010 during the data collection period of this current study.)\n\nBoth business travelers and those providing medical care had the shortest trips (both medians 10 days). Most occupational travelers, including business travelers, planned on staying at hotels, except non-medical service workers who reported dorms/hostels as the most common planned accommodation.\n\nMore business travelers than leisure or VFR travelers were men (61% vs 43%; P < 0.0001) (Table 2). Business travelers had less time to departure than did leisure travelers (15 days vs 29 days; P < 0.0001) but were similar to VFR travelers (15 days vs 14 days; P = 0.05 (Table 2). For leisure and VFR travelers, being concerned about health issues related to travel (40% and 49%, respectively) was the most common reason for the pre-travel consultation. For business travelers, 25% reported being concerned about health issues related to travel as their reason for seeking pre-travel health consultation.\n\nBusiness travelers traveled for shorter periods of time than did leisure travelers (10 days vs 14 days; P < 0.0001) or VFR travelers (10 days vs 30 days; P < 0.0001). Eighty-two percent of business travelers and 60% of leisure travelers chose a hotel as the most common type of accommodation, whereas more than 80% of VFR travelers reported staying in a home with relatives. Of note, VFR travelers had different top destination countries (Ghana, Ethiopia, and Nigeria) compared with both occupational and non-occupational groups. More business travelers reported travel to only urban areas than did leisure (67% vs 24%; P < 0.0001) and VFR (67% vs 45%; P < 0.0001) travelers (data not shown).\n\nThe proportion of business travelers with immunity (those with pre-existing immunity or vaccinated [if indicated] at the pre-travel visit) was at least 90% for tetanus, hepatitis A, YF, and typhoid (Fig. 1). For leisure and VFR travelers, the proportion with immunity was at least 80% for tetanus, YF, and typhoid. Clinicians reported that 78% of business travelers had pre-existing immunity for MMR (28% of those who had pre-existing immunity were born before 1957) and an additional 11% received vaccination at the pre-travel consultation. Thirty-eight percent of business travelers had pre-existing immunity to influenza, and an additional of 29% received vaccinations with the pre-travel visit. Only 60% of business travelers were vaccinated or considered immune to hepatitis B after the pre-travel consultation. At the pre-travel consultation, 40% of VFR travelers, 37% of business travelers, and 27% of leisure travelers received meningococcal vaccine. At the time of the visit, 22% of business, 18% of leisure and 17% of VFR travelers had immunity to JE. Few business, leisure, or VFR travelers were considered immune to or vaccinated against rabies.\n\nFigure 2A and B outlines the reasons for non-vaccination among business, VFR, and leisure travelers. When compared with leisure and business travelers, a higher percentage of VFR travelers declined vaccines. Among those business travelers who were recommended the specific vaccine, 49% declined influenza vaccine, 41% MMR vaccine, 32% meningococcal vaccine, 19% hepatitis B vaccine, 15% rabies vaccine, and 12% JE vaccine. Thirty six percent of leisure and 69% of VFR travelers also declined MMR vaccine. Clinicians reported that influenza vaccine was unavailable for 22% of business, 19% of VFRs, and 21% of leisure travelers. For business travelers, clinicians reported insufficient time to complete the vaccine series for JE (23%), hepatitis A (11%), hepatitis B (10%), and rabies (10%). Based on current CDC criteria, clinicians considered hepatitis B, rabies, meningitis, polio, or JE vaccines not to be indicated for more than half of business or leisure travelers.\n\nFor those traveling to a country where malaria was a risk throughout, 91% of business, 90% of leisure, and 88% of VFR travelers were prescribed an anti-malarial medication. Of the 291 travelers who were not prescribed anti-malarial medication, 19 (7%) declined the medication and 17 (6%) had existing prescription from their primary care provider; there was no additional information for the other 255 (87%) travelers. Mefloquine was the most common prescription for VFR travelers (49%), and atovaquone/proguanil was most common among business (73%) and leisure (76%) travelers.\n\nOur investigation has some limitations. GTEN data, although geographically distributed, may not be representative of the general traveling population, or business travelers in particular; however, our findings are consistent with those of other studies. We focused only on travelers who listed a single purpose of travel and therefore did not explore further those who listed multiple purposes of travel. In addition, purpose of travel was self-selected by travelers, and we focused specifically on those who chose business or other occupational or service as their purpose for travel. There was no additional information, such as whether the traveler received compensation, to support that these travelers were unquestionably occupational or non-occupational. We also recognize that our category of occupational travelers includes a number of sub-groups, which is the reason that we performed sub-analyses. Finally, because sub-national destination data were not available, we could only assess the suitability of malaria chemoprophylaxis recommendations in those traveling to countries where malaria was a risk throughout. Further, GTEN does not systematically collect information on patients who did not receive a prescription for malaria chemoprophylaxis; however, analysis of text fields provided limited information. Despite these limitations, our study is, to our knowledge, the largest analysis of detailed pre-travel health consultations prior to business and occupational-related travel, including data on over 9000 occupational travelers. In this era of large multinational corporations and outsourcing, our findings are of interest to businesses, and particularly to health care workers charged with caring for individuals whose work assignment involves international travel.\n\nBusiness and occupational travel has repetitively been associated with illness not only among travelers themselves, but has also led to the importation of infectious diseases into home and work communities, and these importations often require costly work and public health responses. Business travelers have a distinct profile when compared with other occupational and non-occupational travelers. Employers play a role in encouraging business travelers to seek pre-travel health consultations. Such consultations, even if scheduled immediately before travel, can be an opportunity to identify vaccination gaps and to increase coverage to lessen the likelihood of illness among travelers and importation of pathogens into home and work communities."}
