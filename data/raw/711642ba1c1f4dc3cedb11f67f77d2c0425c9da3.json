{"title": "Alignment independent 3D-QSAR studies and molecular dynamics simulations for the identification of potent and selective S1P 1 receptor agonists", "body": "Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive signaling molecule, is a lysophospholipid (LPL) that involves in different cellular actions such as vascular growth, development and regulation of immune cells, morphogenesis, and arrangement of cytoskeleton [1] . S1P is a lipid with a particular aminoalcohol structure, known as sphingosine which binds to S1P 1-5 receptors [2] . These receptors are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), in which the N-terminal of the proteins forms an amphipathic binding pocket by crafting a helical cap hindering ligands to access the binding pocket [3] . However, it is believed that LPLs attain their binding sites through the cell membrane instead of extracellular region [4] . S1P 1 receptors are expressed on lymphocytes, regulating immune cells (i.e.B-and T-cells) trafficking. The gradient concentration of S1P in blood, interstitial fluid, and lymph controls the egress of lymphocytes [5] . S1P and its analogues cause internalization and degradation of the receptors by sustain activation of S1P 1 receptor, preventing the auto reactivity of immune cells in the target tissues [5, 6] .\n\nDiverse structural moieties have demonstrated S1P 1 receptor agonistic effects which can be potential candidates for being used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases [7, 8] . Fingolimod (FTY720) is a S1P 1 receptor modulator that is approved for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disorder affecting the central nervous system [9, 10] . After conversion to the phosphate form, fingolimod activates S1P 1 , S1P 3 , S1P 4 and S1P 5 receptors. Although the exact roles for S1P4 and S1P 5 receptors remain unclear, the adverse effects of fingolimod are attributed to the activation of S1P 3 receptor [11] . Therefore, in different studies several selective S1P 1 receptor agonists have been synthesized in order to retain the therapeutic properties of S1P 1 receptor agonists with the minimum side effects [5, 12, 13] .\n\nNowadays, three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) methods based on molecular interaction fields (MIFs) approach are accepted as the standard tools in medicinal chemistry for drug design [14] . However, the most rate limiting step in 3D-QSAR studies is the obtaining of appropriate ligand alignment. The Grid-INdependent Descriptors (GRIND) offered an alternative approach in 3D-QSAR analyses in which the alignment of ligands is not required. Instead, the products of interaction energies for each pair of MIFs are used to build the models [15] . There are several examples of successful application of alignment-independent 3D-QSAR methods using GRIND descriptors where the results were comparable to GRID based alignment-dependent studies [16e19].\n\nBolli et al. have synthesized a series of 2-imino-thiazolidin-4one derivatives and investigated their agonistic effects on S1P 1 and S1P 3 receptors [7] . Among all synthesized derivatives, compound 61 demonstrated the highest S1P 1 receptor agonistic activity with the minimum agonism on S1P 3 . Therefore, this compound, currently known as ponesomid, was selected for in vivo studies, in which it could significantly reduce circulating lymphocytes in rat. The current study aimed to generate GRIND-based 3D-QSAR predictive models for agonist activities of these 2-imino-thiazolidin-4one derivatives both on S1P 1 and S1P 3 receptors in order to identify structural features relevant for the selective activation of S1P 1 over S1P 3 receptors. The identified structural features consisted in the developed 3D-QSAR model were used for searching PubChem small molecule database for selecting compounds with selective S1P 1 receptor agonistic activity.\n\nIn the current work, a set of 62 S1P 1 receptor agonists, synthesized based on 2-imino-thiazolidin-4-one scaffold, was selected from literature for 3D-QSAR studies [7] (Table 1 ). All activities expressed as EC 50 were assessed using membrane preparations of CHO cells expressing recombinant human S1P 1 and S1P 3 receptors. These values were converted to pEC 50 and used as the dependent variable in this study. HyperChem software (version 8.0.8) was employed for generation of the 3D structures of the ligands where MM \u00fe force field based on Polack-Ribiere algorithm was used for energy minimization [20] . The structures were further optimized by semi-empirical approaching AM1 algorithm [21] .\n\nThe crystal structure of S1P 1 and the model structure of S1P 3 receptors were used for the docking calculations. The crystal structure of S1P 1 receptor in complex with an antagonist was retrieved from protein data bank (PDB code: 3V2Y) and the 3Dstructural model of S1P 3 was generated using homology modeling in Swiss Model web server [22] based on S1P 1 receptor structure (PDB code: 3V2W.1.A) as the template. The quality and geometrical features of the obtained model was checked using PROCHECK and MolProbity programs [23e25]. Then, the 3D coordinates of the antagonist in complex with S1P 1 receptor were used to dock the studied ligands into the S1P 1 receptor crystal structure using GOLD program (version 5.0, CCDC, Cambridge, UK) running under LINUX operating system [26, 27] .To determine the ligand binding site on S1P 3 , the modeled S1P 3 receptor structure was aligned on S1P 1 receptor-antagonist complex and a new merged complex was built consisting S1P 3 receptor and the antagonist. Finally, the position of the antagonist in the new complex was used as the guide for determining the binding site in docking calculations. ChemPLP scoring function in GOLD program was used for the docking calculations. Docking of the experimentally co-crystallized antagonist into the binding site of S1P 1 receptor resulted in a solution with 0.51 \u00c5 RMSD to its experimentally observed position. Therefore, for all other dockings the same scoring function was used. The best active conformations for the most active compounds in data set (i.e. compounds 61 and 14 for S1P 1 and S1P 3 receptors, respectively) were selected based on their docking scores. The best conformers for the rest of compounds were selected based on the maximum shape similarity to the most active compound (i.e. compounds 61 and 14 for S1P 1 and S1P 3 receptors, respectively) using Tanimoto algorithm implemented in Shape-it program [28] .\n\nThe obtained active conformations were introduced to Pentacle program for producing GRIND-based descriptors. Initially, the molecular interaction fields (MIFs) were generated using GRID based fields [29] by calculating the interaction energies at grid points called nodes between the compounds atoms and different probes including hydrophobic (DRY), hydrogen bond donor, HBD (O), hydrogen bond acceptor, HBA (N1) and shape (TIP) probes.\n\nThe process was followed by discarding the nodes with the energies below the default cut-off values. Then the most favorable regions were extracted from the produced MIFs using AMANDA algorithm based on field intensity at a node and the mutual nodenode distances between the selected nodes [30] . Finally, the encoding of MIFs were processed by the Consistently Large Auto and Cross Correlation (CLACC) algorithm [31] which resulted in more consistent variables compared to Maximum Auto-And Cross-Correlation (MACC) method. The obtained values were then used for generating correlogram plots in which the product of nodenode energies is represented against the distances between the nodes. The selected variables were used to build 3D-QSAR models using partial least square (PLS). The generated models were checked from the quality point of view by internal cross validation methods. Fractional factorial design (FFD) method was employed to extract the most relevant variables to the compounds activities. FFD selection was repeated several times on the models until no improvement in the statistical parameters (r 2 , q 2 and SDEP values) was observed.\n\nThe models were further validated by randomly dividing the original data set into train (48 and 50 compounds for S1P 1 and S1P 3 receptors, respectively) and test sets (12 compounds for both of S1P 1 and S1P 3 receptors) based on the activities using SPSS (version 11.5). The train set compounds were used for construction of the predictive models in order to predict test compounds activities. To identify the outliers, the generated principle component analysis (PCA) for each compound in the 3D-QSAR models were used to define the applicability domain by the method of Roy and coworkers named AD using standardization approach (version 1.0) [32] where the PCA values were the X variables and the Y variable was the biological activities of the studied compounds. Validity of the final models was evaluated using both internal and external cross-validation methods. For internal validation, leave-one-out (LOO) and leave-two-out (LTO) methods were used. The predictivity of the models was also assessed by calculating the standard deviation of the error of prediction (SDEP) and mean absolute error (MAE) based criteria using External Validation Plus (version 1.2) package.\n\nPubChem database of chemical molecules was searched based on the 80% structural similarity to the core structure ( Fig. 1 ) derived from the studied molecules. The search resulted in 1796 compounds from which 90 compounds were discarded based on applying rule of five criteria implemented in PubChem web server. The 3D structures of remained 1706 compounds were retrieved from PubChem and after docking on S1P 1 and S1P 3 receptors, their activities were predicted using the proposed 3D-QSAR models. The physic-chemical properties of the molecules were calculated using HyperChem (version, 8.0.8). The profile-profile alignment was performed using ClustalW program implemented in ClustalX (version 2.0) [33] .\n\nEnergy minimization and binding free energy calculation were carried out using AMBER suite of programs with AMBER-ff99 force field (version 14) operating on a Linux-based (Centus 6.8) GPU work station. The best pose for each of the ligands (61, 400, 452, 798 and 799) obtained by docking calculations was used for MD simulations. Ligand input files for MD simulations were generated using Antechamber package which is designed to be used with the \"general AMBER force field (GAFF) [34e36]. In order to prepare S1P 1 receptor-ligand complex in lipid membrane environment, CHARMM force field available at CHARMM-GUI web-based platform (charmm-gui.org) [37] was employed where the complex was embedded in a hydrated, pre-equilibrated 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) lipid bilayer with 130 DOPC molecules per complex. The system was neutralized by addition of potassium and chloride ions to the final concentration of 150 mM and then converted to tleap and Lipid14 readable file using charmmlipi-d2amber.py script. Subsequently, the produced file was introduced to tleap program where Lipid14 [38] and Amber-ff99SB force fields implemented in AmberTools 14 were recruited to generate Amber topology and initial coordinates files.\n\nThe generated system was submitted to a short energy minimization process including 5000 steps of steepest descent and 5000 steps of conjugate gradient followed by a 100 ps heating step from 0 K to 100 K in a NVT and then from 100 K to 303 K in a NPT ensembles both with 10.0 kcal mol \u00c01 A \u00c02 harmonic restrains applied to the protein and to the lipids. Then, the system was equilibrated in the NPT ensemble at 303 K (controlled with Langevin thermostat) with 1 bar pressure for 2 ns followed by gradually removing the restraints. Only bond lengths involving hydrogen atoms were constrained using the SHAKE algorithm.\n\nThe final production of dynamic simulation was performed for 125 ns by applying the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method under periodic boundary condition where no constraint was applied to the protein, lipids and the ligand molecules. Binding energies were calculated for ligandereceptor complexes using molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) and the molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) algorithms. The interaction energies were calculated excluding lipid, water molecules and counter ions and presented as the average value.\n\nThe aim of this study is to derive 3D-QSAR models for a set of 62 compounds with 2-imino-thiazolidin-4-one scaffold ( Table 1 ) in order to identify the structural features essential for the interaction of the compounds with S1P 1 and S1P 3 receptors. The obtained results could be used for identifying new ligands active on S1P 1 receptors in database search and drug design studies. In the current study, the crystal structure of S1P 1 receptor in complex with an antagonist was used for virtual screening to identify S1P 1 agonists. It has been elucidated that GPCRs adopt active or inactive structure upon binding to either an agonist or an antagonist, respectively. Up to now, the structure of S1P 1 with an agonist has not been solved experimentally, therefore, the antagonist-bound S1P 1 structure was used in the current study. To examine how different might be the active and inactive forms of S1P 1 receptor, the active and inactive structures of closely related GPCR was investigated. The basic local alignment tool (BLAST) was employed to search protein data bank for structurally known homologous GPCRs. The search identified adenosine A2A receptor bound to an antagonist (PDB code: 3PWH) as one of the closest homologues of S1P 1 receptor (28.67% identity, 85% coverage, and 2 \u00c2 10 \u00c023 E-value). As a matter of fact, the structure of adenosine A2A receptor could have been used as the template for homology modeling of S1P 1 receptor if there was no experimental structure for S1P 1 itself. There are two other structures for adenosine A2A receptor co-crystallized with agonist ligands (PDB IDs: 3QAK and 2YDO). Assuming agonist and antagonist bound structures of receptor representing the active and inactive forms, calculation of the Ca RMSDs between the adenosine A2A active and inactive forms revealed that they are very similar (RMSD values of 3QAK and 2YDO active structures against 3PWH inactive structure are 1.37 and 1.33 \u00c5), which is comparable to the difference between two active structures (RMSD value of 0.82 \u00c5). The structures of adenosine A2A receptor in active and inactive forms are compared in Fig. 2 . These observations for the most identical GPCR with known structure to the S1P 1 receptor indicate the viability of using antagonist-bound S1P 1 receptor structure for the purpose of current study, and it may not be feasible to distinguish fine structural differences between the active and inactive forms of the receptor by MD simulations. Moreover, in this study, semi-flexible docking procedure was utilized for the docking of ligands retrieved from the database structure similarity search.\n\nSWISS-MODEL automated homology modeling server was used to develop the 3D structure for S1P 3 receptor. The server was provided by the sequence of S1P 3 and the generated models as well as the corresponding quality measures were generated. The best model proposed by SWISS-MODEL was built based on S1P 1 receptor structure (PDB code: 3V2W.1.A) as the template with~48% similarity to the target sequence. The RMSD value between the template and the model was 0.08, calculated by DeepView (version 3.7) program. The quality of the modeled structure was verified using different methods as outlined below. PROCHECK and Mol-Probity programs showed that 100.0% (270/270) of all residues were in allowed (>99.8%) regions. The QMEAN z-score reported for the model by SWISS-MODEL server was \u00c03.17. Although this value demonstrates a moderate quality for the built model, taking into account that S1P 3 belongs to GPCRs family, the model can be considered acceptable.\n\nThe model structure of S1P 3 and the experimental structure of S1P 1 receptors were used for the docking studies. The active conformation for each ligand was obtained by docking the compound into the active site of S1P 1 and S1P 3 receptors using GOLD program. To do this, the best active conformation for the most active compound in each data set (i.e. compounds 61 and 14 for S1P 1 and S1P 3 receptors, respectively) was selected based on just the docking scores (compounds 61 and 14 had docking scores of 64.56 and 60.18 upon docking into S1P 1 and S1P 3 receptors). Then, by applying Tanimoto similarity method implemented in Shape-it program (version 1.0.1), the active conformations of the remaining compounds in the data sets were selected based on the similarity of the generated docking solutions for each compound to the selected conformation of the most active compound (Tables 2 and  3 ). The compounds in the selected conformations were used in QSAR model building as outlined below.\n\nAfter selection of the best conformations for the ligands, the compounds were divided into train and test sets randomly based on their biological activities using SPSS program (version 11.5) in an effort to have similar range of biological activities for both sets. The train compounds were subjected to Pentacle program and the generated GRIND-based descriptors were used to build 3D-QSAR models. FFD variable selection was performed for several times on the generated models until no significant changes in statistical indices (squared correlation coefficient r 2 , cross validated correlation coefficient q 2 and SDEP) were observed. The internal predictivity of the models was evaluated by LOO and LTO methods and the obtained statistics are shown in Table 4 . As seen in Table 4 , the r 2 acc values and standard deviation of error in calculation (SDEC) for S1P 1 and S1P 3 models have been improved by increasing the number of latent variables and reached to the optimum values with five latent variables (5LVs). Although LOO and LTO q 2 values (i.e., 0.39 and 0.42, respectively) for S1P 1 model with 5LVs are lower than that with 2, 3 and 4 LVs, the overall assessment of internal validation and prediction errors suggested the model with 5LVs as the best model for activity prediction. However, in the case of S1P 3 model, the model generated with 5LVs was validated as the best predictive model from both predictivity (i.e., q2 LOO, 0.48 and q2 LTO 0.49) and level of errors (SDEC, 0.19) points of view. Fig. 3 illustrates the distance dependent plot of PLS coefficients for the selected variables analyzed with 5LVs during 3D-QSAR model development. The most important variables for the 3D-QSAR models are summarized in Table 5 . As it can be seen in Table 5 and Fig. 3 , the S1P 1 and S1P 3 models share DRY-DRY (14e14.4 \u00c5), N1eN1 (11.2e11.6 \u00c5), TIP-TIP (17.6e18 \u00c5) and N1-TIP (4.4e4.8 and 8e8.4 \u00c5) variables with almost equal probe-probe distances; while, DRY-N1 (10.4e10.8 \u00c5) and DRY-O (12.4e12.8 \u00c5) variables were unique MIF pairs which were selected just in S1P 1 model with positive and negative impacts on biological activities, respectively. As seen in Fig. 4 DRY-N1 (10.4e10.8 \u00c5) variable connects thiazolidine ring to hydroxyl moiety at the most end of the structure indicating that the presence of an hydrophobic region (for example thiazolidine ring in compound 61) at the distance of 10.4e10.8 \u00c5 from a hydrogen acceptor group (i.e., hydroxyl group in compound 61) positively influences the biological activities as well as the selectivity of the studied compounds towards S1P 1 receptor. On the other hand, analyzing the PLS coefficients revealed that the positive impact of DRY-N1 variable is higher for the compounds 02, 04, 21, 23, 25, 25, 26, 28, 29, 59 and 62 whose selectivity towards S1P 1 is higher compared to the compounds 44, 45, 46, 56 and 58 as the least selective compounds towards S1P 1 over S1P 3 receptor. Another selectivity inducing variable, DRY-O (12.4e12.8 \u00c5), connects a hydrophobic region (i.e., thiazolidine ring in compound 61) to a hydrogen donor group (i.e., etheric oxygen in compound 61), far apart 10.4e10.8 \u00c5 from each other which adversely affects the S1P 1 receptor agonistic activity. The impact of this variable is lower for the S1P 1 selective compounds such as compounds 22, 25, 42, 60 and 62 which are the S1P 1 selective compounds rather than S1P 3 receptor. Taking into account all these explanations, it seems that DRY-N1 and DRY-O variables can be considered as the S1P 1 receptor selectivity-introducing factors for the studied compounds.\n\nFor external prediction, based on the model statistics, five latent variables (LVs) were selected as the optimum number of PLS components for both S1P 1 and S1P 3 receptors activity prediction models. The r 2 values for external prediction were 0.75 and 0.62 with SDEP values of 0.33 and 0.21 for S1P 1 and S1P 3 models, respectively, indicating the good predictive power of the developed models. Experimental vs. predicted values are presented in Table 1 and Fig. 5 .\n\nAccording to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) [32, 39] , it is required to define the applicability domain (AD) for the developed QSAR models. Therefore, the calculated PC values during the PLS analysis for the studied compounds and their biological activities were analyzed by \"Applicability Domain using standardization approach\" program to determine the possible outliers in train and test sets [32] . The results indicated none of the structures as the outlier. To further evaluate the robustness of the models, the errors of the predicted values were calculated and the results are presented in Table 6 . The calculated mean absolute errors of the predictions for 95% of the test sets were 0.28 and 0.13 for S1P 1 and S1P 3 models, respectively. These error values are smaller than 0.30 and 0.27 (i.e., 10% of the train set activity range for S1P 1 and S1P 3 models data sets, respectively) indicating adequate prediction ability of the models. Using more rigorous treatment of the predictions by MAE-based Table 2 Docking scores and Tanimoto index for the studied compounds upon docking the ligands into S1P 1 receptor. Shape-it program was used to select a conformation of each ligand structurally similar to the most active compound. GOLD scores and Tanimoto index values are included for comparison.\n\nShape-it selecton Table 4 The statistical data of the built PLS model for S1P 1 and S1P 3 agonists. Abbreviations: SDEC, standard deviation of error in calculation; SDEP, standard deviation of error of prediction. The acc stands for accumulative value, Validation methods used for calculation of q 2 are: leave one out (LOO), leave two out (LTO) and random five groups out (R5GO). \n\nIn order to propose potential S1P 1 receptor selective agonists, PubChem database of chemical molecules was searched based on 80% structural similarity to the core structure of the studied compounds (Fig. 1) . The molecules identified by similarity search (1706 structures) were docked on the binding site of S1P 1 and S1P 3 receptors. The agonistic activities for the best docking poses of the identified molecules were predicted based on the developed 3D-QSAR models. The results demonstrated that compounds 400 (PubChem ID: 136647497), 452 (PubChem ID: 72785505), 798 (PubChem ID: 18758433) and 799 (PubChem ID: 18758427) could bind to S1P 1 receptor with predicted EC 50 values of 0.65, 3.63, 1.35 and 0.68 nM, respectively, while their predicted affinities towards S1P 3 receptor were estimated to be considerably low (Table 7) . Comparing the predicted affinities towards S1P 1 and S1P 3 receptors showed excellent selectivity for compound 452 (S1P 3 EC 50 /S1P 1 EC 50 : 13489). This level of predicted selectivity is comparable with the selectivities reported for S1P 1 agonists in clinical trials such as ozanimod [19] and siponimod [40] and much greater than that of compound 61, indicating that compound 452 is noteworthy to be evaluated in experiments for development of a potent and selective S1P 1 agonist. Moreover, among the selected compounds, compound 799 showed high predicted EC 50 value (0.68 nM) with acceptable S1P 1 over S1P 3 selectivity (5888 times), demonstrating its feasibility to be explored as a potent and selective S1P 1 agonist. Overall, it seems that the selected compounds from PubChem search can be considered as promising selective and potent S1P 1 receptor agonists. 5 . Experimental vs predicted EC 50 values for compounds. Form data set, 48 and 50 compounds were used as train sets for S1P 1 and S1P 3 models, respectively while 12 compounds as test sets. Open and filled squares indicate train and test sets compounds, respectively. \n\nThe 3D illustrations of the obtained best docking pose for compounds 61, 400, 452, 798 and 799 in complex with S1P 1 receptor are shown in Fig. 6 and compared with S1P 1 receptor cocrystallized antagonist. As seen in Fig. 6 , compound 61 from the data set interacts differently with the receptor compared to S1P 1 receptor co-crystallized antagonist and the compounds identified from PubChem search. However, the latter compounds bind the same site as the antagonist, which may indicate their capability of S1P 1 receptor recognition. Analyzing the chemical structures of the selected compounds reveals some important details about the observed results in terms of predicted potency and selectivity of these structures. Table 8 summarizes the physic-chemical properties of the selected compounds in comparison to compound 61, S1P, ozanimod, and siponimod. The analysis shows that those compounds more hydrophobic than compound 61 have higher predicted activities, which may be attributed to the easy penetration of more lipophilic compounds into the innermost binding site of S1P 1 receptor (Fig. 7) . In an effort to identify the interaction modes of agonists with the receptor, the 2D illustrations of the bindings were generated using Discovery Studio Visualization (version 17.2.0) program (Fig. 8) . The results revealed that the binding of compounds 400, 452, 798 and 799 with S1P 1 receptor are dominantly stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. Site directed mutational studies have revealed the importance of Arg 120 and Glu 121 residues located at the extracellular end of third transmembrane helix of S1P Table 7 The structures and the predicted activities for compounds selected from PubChem search.as the S1P 1 agonists. The database of chemical molecules in PubChem was searched based on 80% similarity to the core structure originated from the data set and the selected compounds activities were predicted by the generated 3D-QSAR models. receptors in signal transduction [41, 42] . Gonzalez-Cabrera et al.\n\nshowed that ligands not interacting with both Arg 120 and Glu 121 residues or interact just with one of them can exert agonistic activity with improved specificity [43] . 2D analysis of the identified ligands docked into the binding site of S1P 1 receptor (Fig. 8 ) revealed that they do not interact at a time with Arg 120 and Glu 121 . These observations are in agreement with the selective agonistic S1P 1 activities predicted for the identified compounds obtained from database search [43, 44] . Moreover, the identified compounds also interact with Phe 210 and Trp 269 residues, which are known essential for agonistic activity as confirmed by the point mutagenesis studies [3] . Further, these ligands interact with Leu 276 and Met 124 at the binding site of S1P 1 which are S1P 1 selectivityinducing residues over S1P 3 and S1P 4 receptors, respectively [3] . The identification of the selective S1P 1 receptor agonists demonstrated in the previous section outlines the potential for selectivity predictions based on the above mentioned qualitative descriptions of the binding modes to S1P receptors defined implicitly in the developed 3D-QSAR models. Fig. 9 . Although not very conclusive, but one may state that the binding sites available on S1P 1 receptor and E protein for compound 452 could share similar environment.\n\n3.6. S1P 1 receptor binding energies of the ligands\n\nIn order to calculate the free binding energies of the compounds identified from PubChem search in complex with S1P 1 receptor, the MD simulations were performed using Lipid14 [38] and Amber-ff99SB force fields available in AMBER 14. To do this, S1P 1 receptor with docked ligands was embedded in lipid bilayer membrane (Fig. 10) and MD simulated for 125 ns. Table 9 represents the calculated binding energies for ligands-receptor interactions using MM-GBSA and MM-PBSA algorithms after 125 ns MD simulations. The results revealed that compound 400 binds S1P 1 receptor stronger than the rest of studied compounds with the binding DG values of \u00c046.18 and \u00c09.75 kcal mol \u00c01 , calculated by MM-GBSA and MM-PBSA algorithms, respectively In the MD simulations, compound 61 was used for comparison which showed the lowest affinity towards S1P 1 receptor with DG binding energy values of \u00c028.38 and 28.98 kcal mol \u00c01 , calculated by MM-GBSA and MM-PBSA algorithms, respectively. Interestingly, the receptor binding energy (DG ) values of the studied compounds (Table 9 ) correlate strongly with their predicted EC 50 values (Table 7) calculated by S1P 1 3D-QSAR model, which in turn, further validates the developed model.\n\nIn the current work, we aimed to build 3D-QSAR predictive models for a series of S1P 1 and S1P 3 receptors agonists in order to identify structural features required to design S1P 1 receptor selective agonists. The validity of the developed models was evaluated by the internal and external cross validation methods, in which the generated models showed adequate statistical parameters for their predictive abilities. The results showed that interactions such as DRY-N1 and DRY-O promote the agonistic activity towards S1P 1 receptor. Furthermore, structural variables associated with hydrophobic moieties are the important features influencing the S1P 1 receptor selectivity of the studied compounds.\n\nStructural similarity search of PubChem database using the core structure of the data set as the query structure identified 1706 compounds of which compounds 400, 452, 798, and 799 demonstrated excellent predicted potencies and selectivities towards S1P 1 receptor. Docking of the most potent compound (i.e., compound 61) in the data set and those identified by database similarity search showed that they interact differently with S1P 1 receptor which may be attributed to the higher lipophilicity of the identified compounds compared to compound 61 from the data set. The identified most selective compound from the similarity search bind to E protein from Human coronavirus which may share commonality with S1P 1 receptor in terms of binding site, providing further evidence in agreement with the results obtained from 3D-QSAR model. Moreover, S1P 1 receptor binding energies were calculated using molecular dynamics simulations for the agonists identified from PubChem database search. The results were indicative of their appropriate receptor affinities due to the negative binding energies, which are also in close agreement with the predicted EC 50 values.

As seen, compounds 61 (shown as green sticks) is interacting differently with S1P 1 receptor compared to S1P 1 receptor co-crystallized antagonist (yellow) and compounds 400 (pink), 452 (orange), 798 (cyan), and 799 (purple).

The profiles were generated using their closely related sequences extracted from NCBI. As seen, E protein can be aligned with the 5th transmembrane helix of S1P 1 receptor. The alignment was performed using ClustalW program implemented in ClustalX (version 2.0).\n\nThe results of this work can be useful for designing novel potent and selective S1P 1 receptor agonists.\n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.
