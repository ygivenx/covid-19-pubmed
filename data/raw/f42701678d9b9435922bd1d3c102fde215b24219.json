{"title": "Health in Southeast Asia 1 Health and health-care systems in southeast Asia: diversity and transitions", "body": "Southeast Asia consists of the ten independent countries located along the continental arcs and off shore archipelagos of Asia-Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar (Burma) (fi gure 1)-collectively known as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The region contains more than half a billion people spread over highly diverse countries, from economic powerhouses like Singapore to poorer economies such as Laos, Cambodia,\n\n\u2022 The diversity of geography and history, including social, cultural, and economic diff erences, have contributed to highly divergent health status and health systems across and within countries of southeast Asia. \u2022 Demographic transition is taking place at among the fastest rates compared with other regions of the world, whether in terms of fertility reductions, population ageing, and rural-to-urban migration. Rapid epidemiological transition is also occurring, with the disease burden shifting from infectious to chronic diseases. \u2022 Rapid urbanisation, population movement, and highdensity living raise concerns about newly emerging infectious diseases, but these outbreaks have stimulated regional cooperation in information exchange and improvement in disease surveillance systems. \u2022 Southeast Asia's peculiar geology contributes to it being the most disaster-prone region in the world, more susceptible to natural and man-made disasters aff ecting health, including earthquakes, typhoons, fl oods, and environmental pollution. Climate change along with rapid economic development could exacerbate the spread of emerging infectious diseases.\n\n(Continues on next column) (Continued from previous column)\n\n\u2022 Health systems in the region are a dynamic mix of public and private delivery and fi nancing, with new organisational forms such as corporatised public hospitals, and innovative service delivery responding to competitive private health-care markets and growing medical tourism. \u2022 The health-care systems are highly diverse, ranging from dominant tax-based fi nancing to social insurance and high out-of-pocket payments across the region. There is a greater push for universal coverage of the population, but more needs to be done to ensure access to health services for the poor. \u2022 Private health expenditure is increasing relative to government expenditure, where new forms of fi nancing include user charges, improved targeting of subsidies, and greater cost recovery. Health-care fi nancing could be further restructured in response to future demographic shifts in age-dependency, as in introduction of medical savings and social insurance for long-term care. \u2022 There is potential for greater public-private participation with economic growth through ASEAN integration and further regional health collaboration, despite the current division of the region under two WHO regional offi ces.\n\nand Myanmar (table) . [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] By comparison with India and China, southeast Asia is less visible in global politics and economics. The same is also true of global health. In the fi rst paper in this Lancet Series on health in southeast Asia, we analyse the key demographic and epidemiological transitions of the region to delineate the challenges facing health systems and to emphasise potential for regional collaboration in health. This regional overview sets the scene for more detailed discussion of specifi c health issues presented in the fi ve subsequent reports in this Series, profi ling maternal and child health, 8 infectious diseases, 9 non-communicable diseases, 10 health workforce challenges, 11 and health-care fi nancing reforms. 12\n\nSoutheast Asia contains about 600 million people, or 9% of the world's population, with Indonesia having the largest population (and fourth largest in the world) and Brunei the smallest (see table) . Nearly half (43%) of the region's population live in urban areas, which is less than the world average, but there is much variation between countries, from 15% in Cambodia to 100% in Singapore. The region's average population density of 133 people per km\u00b2 also masks substantial intercountry and in some instances intracountry diff erences. Population densities range from a low of 27 people per km\u00b2 in Laos to a high of 7022 per km\u00b2 in Singapore. 16 Population densities in southeast Asia's only two megacities, Jakarta and Manila, are much higher, at more than 10 000 people per km\u00b2. 17 Although their population sizes are similar (around 14 million), the greater sprawl of Manila and Jakarta make them less densely populated (ranked 15th and 17th in the world) than Mumbai and Delhi (ranked 1st and 13th, respectively). The next largest city in southeast Asia, Bangkok, is ranked 39th. Although urbanisation is expected to continue to rise in the region, urban slum populations seem to be less deprived than they are elsewhere, with about a quarter living in extreme shelter deprivation (defi ned by UN Habitat as a slum household lacking three or more of the following conditions: access to water, access to sanitation, access to secure tenure, a durable housing structure, and suffi cient living space). 18, 19 \n\nAlthough life expectancy in all countries in the region has improved, there have been signifi cant variations in the rate of progress. Most countries have enjoyed continuous rises in life expectancy since the 1950s, and these are converging. In some cases (Myanmar, Cambodia) political regimes and history of confl ict have aff ected progress, as has HIV in Thailand (fi gure 2). Where life expectancy gains have slowed, this trend has been mainly attributable to slow progress in reduction of adult mortality. 15 There has been little progress towards reduction of intercountry diff erence in life expectancy during the past 50 years, with the gap remaining at around 20 years.\n\nAs elsewhere, decreased fertility has been the main factor contributing to ageing of the populations in these countries. The speed and timing of fertility reduction has varied widely across the region (webappendix p 1). Singapore had the earliest and sharpest reduction-the total fertility rate fell from more than six children per woman in 1957 to 2\u00b71 in the mid-1970s, and since 2003, it has ranked among countries with ultra-low fertility (table). 20 Thailand's fertility decrease mirrors that of Singapore, although beginning somewhat later; it is currently the only other country in the region with \n\nWe used quantitative and qualitative data from academic and grey literature to review the health situation in southeast Asia. Search terms used were \"health\", \"health statistics\", \"health systems\", \"socio-economic development\", and \"southeast Asia\". Data were gathered after a call for information from regional experts on selected subthemes related to health (geography, history, demography, epidemiology, and health systems Rapid socioeconomic development and strong family planning programmes are likely to have driven this reduction. Interestingly, this statement was true for Indonesia, but less so for Brunei and Malaysia, although all three countries share a common dominant religion, Islam. 21 Malaysia adopted a pronatalist policy in the late 1970s under the then Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad. 22 Catholicism has been a major contributing factor to the slow uptake of family planning programmes in the Philippines, alongside the persistence of cultural norms that support large family sizes. 23 The high fertility rates recorded in Cambodia and Laos are related to low educational levels, as refl ected in their low proportion of enrolment in secondary school-25-44% compared with 61-90% elsewhere in the region (including 72% in Vietnam). 24 According to Cleland, 25 although literacy confers cognitive abilities to use contraception, the social and psychological skills conferred by higher education probably enable people to \"translate the desire to postpone or limit childbearing into contraceptive practice\u2026 [and] they are also more likely to use allopathic health services for a range of needs including ante-and natal-care, child immunization and curative care [that lead to better child survival]\".\n\nEconomic and demographic developments have prompted the movement of people across the region, mainly for short-term employment, but also for settlement. 26 Rapid economic growth and the slowing of domestic population and labour force growth due to fertility reduction have prompted countries such as Singapore to open its doors to in-migration of foreigners at all skill levels for employment, with the option of permanent settlement for the highly skilled. The Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam are major labour-exporters, whereas Malaysia and Thailand both receive and send nationals abroad. Besides this internal labour market, countries in southeast Asia also send and receive migrants from outside the region. Since the 1980s, however, destinations within Asia have replaced labour migration to countries such as the USA and to the Middle East. 26 There is signifi cant undocumented or illegal migration as well as movement of displaced people in the region. 27, 28 These groups are particularly vulnerable since \"[u]ndocumented migrants are disproportionately more exposed to health risks due to inadequate working conditions and irregular movements, but are unlikely to seek medical attention because of their status, and are also often left out of assistance programmes in times of disasters and emergencies\". 27\n\nPopulation age structures of countries in the region vary widely as a result of past diff erences in fertility, mortality, and migration trends (fi gure 3). These trends are in turn aff ected by economic, social, cultural, and political developments. Singapore and Thailand have among the fastest ageing populations in the world, with the proportion of elderly residents projected to double from 7% to 14% in 19 and 22 years, respectively-shorter than the 26 years expected for Japan 29-31 because of more rapid fertility reduction in these two countries. With increasing longevity, the pace of increase in numbers of the oldest old, aged 80 years and older, in southeast Asia is projected to exceed that of east Asia over the period 2025-50. 32 The other major factor contributing to population ageing has been the decrease in mortality. Figure 4 shows estimated trends in risk of child death (ie, between birth and age 5 years) in countries of the region during the past four decades. Child survival has improved substantially in all countries, but particularly in Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Brunei, and Singapore, where the risk of child death is now typically less than about 0\u00b75%, compared with 15-20% in the 1970s. 13 Measured by the risk of dying between ages 15 and 60 years, regional diversity in levels of adult mortality is even greater than for child mortality (fi gure 5). Typically, the risk of dying at these ages for men is 20-30%, and is higher (32%) in Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar (26-27%), and signifi cantly lower in Singapore, where the level is similar to those in Australia and Japan (7-8%). This regional diversity in risk of adult death is similar for women, but with rates typically 20-30% less than those for men. 15\n\nIncreasing longevity is a result of diminishing burden from communicable, maternal, and perinatal diseases (group 1 diseases; webappendix p 2), whereas countries with aged populations have a higher burden of noncommunicable diseases (group 2 diseases). Interestingly, mortality rates from these two groups of diseases, as well as from injuries, are correlated. Countries with high mortality rates from communicable diseases also have high death rates from chronic diseases (webappendix p 2). Deaths from communicable diseases are still prominent in Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos. Injuries are an important cause of death in all countries, but less so in Singapore and Brunei.\n\nFew countries in the region have complete cause of death data systems to inform health policy and planning, and of those that do only Singapore has reliable cause of death certifi cation and coding. Although not representative of present health conditions in neighbouring countries, understanding of how leading causes of death have changed in Singapore during the past 40 years or so can provide important insights into what other countries of the region could expect to achieve, provided there is a similarly strong public health commitment to disease control and injury prevention. Figure 6 summarises trends in selected causes of death for both sexes in Singapore since 1963.\n\nIn the early stages of transition, striking reductions in infectious diseases such as tuberculosis were achieved, off set by increases in non-communicable diseases including cardiovascular diseases and cancers, as well as injuries. Although deaths due to road traffi c accidents have subsequently decreased and cardiovascular diseases seem to have reached a plateau, breast cancer has continued to rise. Except for stomach and cervical cancer, mortality from all other cancers is still rising (data not shown). These data illustrate the success of Singapore in reducing mortality from the diseases of poverty, as well as the eff ects of inadequate chronic disease control programmes, although there is evidence of some success in control of lifestyle-related diseases in recent years. As other countries in the region succeed in bringing communicable diseases under control, the importance of injury prevention and chronic disease control programmes will become increasingly pressing.\n\nThe region as a whole does not have reliable longitudinal data for disease trends. However, evidence from studies of disease prevalence shows a strong inverse association with national wealth, which can be largely attributed to the social determinants of health, including the provision of more effi cient health systems with greater population coverage. The fi gure provided on p 3 of the webappendix shows the relation between prevalence of tuberculosis and per head income (log-log scale). The regression equation (not shown) suggests that a doubling of per head income is associated with a reduction in tuberculosis prevalence of 73%. For diabetes mellitus prevalence, countries can be roughly divided into three groups that are positively correlated with income, although the eff ect tapers off at higher levels of per head income, (webappendix p 4), possibly because of more eff ective disease control programmes with greater coverage.\n\nHIV was introduced into the region in the 1980s. Transmission peaked in the early 1990s in Thailand, followed by Myanmar and Cambodia. 33 HIV/AIDS has been a major cause of death in some countries of the region (eg, Thailand), 34 although its spread has been partly controlled by the promotion of condom use. 35 In the early 2000s, more eff ective antiviral therapies emerged, followed by the introduction of compulsory licensing. 36 Although universal access to treatment has been attempted, patient compliance and losses to follow-up care are still prevalent. 37, 38 AIDS mortality in southeast Asia has stabilised since the mid-1990s, although prevalence remains high in Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia. 15\n\nThe environment continues to be an important contributing factor to disease and mortality in the developing world, including countries in southeast Asia, accounting for up to a quarter of all deaths. 39 Regular monsoons and typhoons occur in southeast Asia. The El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a phenomena also intensify the annual variation of the hot and wet climate, leading to droughts, fl oods, and the occurrence of infectious diseases such as malaria and cholera. 40 Countries in the northern part of the region such as the Philippines and Vietnam are badly aff ected by seasonal typhoons that have increased in intensity over time.\n\nThe Philippines and Indonesia are located on the Pacifi c Ring of Fire, 41 a zone of earthquakes and volcanoes where around 90% of the world's earthquakes occur. 42 Southeast Asia is one of the most disaster-prone regions in the world; the Indian Ocean earthquake off the coast of Sumatra in 2004 caused a devastating tsunami in Aceh, Indonesia, and countries on the fringe of the Indian Ocean, one of the worst natural disasters ever recorded.\n\nUncontrolled forest fi res raged in the Indonesian states of Kalimantan and Sumatra in 1997. The severity of the fi res was also closely linked to the occurrence of the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, which has historically brought severe drought conditions to southeast Asia, creating conditions ripe for fi res. In 1997, the severity and extent of haze pollution was unprecedented, aff ecting some 300 million people across the region. 43 The health-related cost of the haze was estimated to be US$164 million. 44 The health eff ects of the 1997 haze in southeast Asia have been well documented. 45, 46 An increase in concentration of particulate matter with diameter 10 \u03bcm or less from 50 \u03bcg/m\u00b3 to 150 \u03bcg/m\u00b3 was signifi cantly associated with increases of 12% in upper respiratory tract illness, 19% in asthma, and 26% in rhinitis from public outpatient care facilities in Singapore. 47 Time-series analyses in people admitted to hospital in Kuching, Malaysia, showed that signifi cant fi re-related increases occurred in respiratory hospital admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. Survival analyses suggested that people older than 65 years who had been previously admitted to hospital for cardio respiratory and respiratory diseases were signifi cantly more likely to be readmitted during the 1997 haze episode. 48 Climate change could exacerbate the spread of emerging infectious diseases in the region, especially vector-borne diseases linked to rises in temperature and rainfall. 49 Southeast Asia has been identifi ed as a region that could be vulnerable to eff ects of climate change on health, because of large rainfall variability linked to the El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a oscillation, with attendant consequences for health systems. 50 \n\nSoutheast Asia's rich history and recent industrialisation and globalisation have raised new challenges for the region's health systems. Modern medical technology is available in the world market but at costs higher than most of the region's population can aff ord. Many traditional health practices persist alongside the use of new medical technologies and pharmaceutical products, presenting regulatory problems in terms of safety and quality. With increasing educational levels, ageing populations, and growing consciousness of human rights in the recently developing democratic environment, the demand for better care is increasing. Health systems in the region face more serious adjustment problems than ever before. 51 Health services have become an important industry, with a mix of public and private non-profi t and for-profi t actors, along with the growth of trade and medical tourism. The provision, fi nancing, and regulatory functions of the public sector have to adapt accordingly to these transformations. The need to restructure healthcare delivery and fi nancing systems becomes crucial to balance new demand and supply equilibriums. 52, 53 Countries in southeast Asia and their health system reforms can thus be categorised according to the stages of development of their health-care systems. A typology of common issues, challenges, and priorities are generated for the diverse mix of health systems of southeast Asia at diff erent stages of socioeconomic development (see webappendix pp 5-8). The pressures placed on national health-care systems by the recent demographic and epidemiological transitions that we have described are amplifi ed by the growing demands of an increasingly educated and affl uent population for high quality health care and the supply of the latest medical technology. Before the east Asian fi nancial crisis in 1997-98 and the recent global economic recession, an expanding middle class in the urban populations of the larger cities pushed their demand for high quality care into a booming private sector. As a result, market forces have turned many aspects of health care into a new industry in countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand, contributing to labour-force distortions for the production and distribution of health workers both within and across countries.\n\nThe 1990s began with the opening up of socialist states and rapid growth among market economies in the region. While they were each fi nding ways to reform their health systems, the Asian fi nancial crisis in 1997-98 posed more challenges for countries of the region. The depreciation of local currencies resulted in increased costs of imported drugs and other essential supplies, at the same time as access to basic health care was reduced for the most vulnerable population groups. 54 However, reported spikes in suicides and mental illnesses in the other aff ected east Asian economies such as South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong were not as signifi cant in southeast Asia. 55 Following the lessons learnt from the past fi nancial crisis, most countries have strengthened their social protection mechanisms and essential health services. There is a greater push among countries to increase universal coverage of basic health services, especially to vulnerable and disadvantaged populations. 56, 57 Throughout the region, many innovative pro-poor fi nancing schemes were implemented, such as the Health Card and 30-baht Schemes in Thailand, the Health Fund for the Poor in Vietnam, Health Equity Funds in Cambodia and Laos, and, even in affl uent Singapore, the Medifund, a meanstested hospital fees subsidy scheme for indigent patients.\n\nSo far, the health-care systems with dominant tax funding are fairly stable, in view of the strong role of governments and eff ective controls by health agencies to overcome inequity problems. However, crucial issues involve rising costs, future sustainability of centralised tax-fi nanced systems, effi ciency and quality of the public services, and higher public expectations. In both Malaysia and Singapore, the health-care systems are changing from government-dominated health services towards greater private-sector involvement. Attempts to privatise public hospitals have been controversial, thus resulting in many hybrid forms of corporatised entities that continue to be controlled or subsidised by governments. [58] [59] [60] [61] Some of the most innovative and advanced forms of publicprivate mix in health services have developed within the region, for example the restructuring or corporatisation of public hospitals in Singapore from as early as 1985 and the later Swadana (self-fi nancing) hospitals in Indonesia. 62 With the anticipated rise in the ageing population and future problems of intergenerational funding through pay-as-you-go mechanisms, there are experiments with new health-care fi nancing such as compulsory medical savings and social insurance for long term care. [63] [64] [65] Some countries such as the Philippines, Vietnam, and Indonesia have radically decentralised their health-care systems with the devolution of health services to local governments, a restructuring that has aff ected aspects of systems performance and equity even though the impetus for Cardiovascular diseases excluding RHD Breast cancer Tuberculosis Road traffic accidents decentralisation was mainly political. 66 Consequently, to ensure increased fi nancial coverage and aff ordability, many governments have passed laws to establish national health insurance systems and mandated universal coverage, although implementation is problematic. With existing policies of decentralisation and liberalisation, equity issues and poor infrastructure will continue to challenge the development of the health sector. 57,67\n\nThe severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic has emphasised the need to strengthen regional health collaboration. This cooper ation has occurred via two channels-direct bilateral collaboration by individual countries (ministries of health and foreign aff airs) and those under the aegis of ASEAN. The Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance project is an example of successful health cooperation. It was established under the collective agreement of each Ministry of Health of member states of the Greater Mekong subregion to share important public health information. The emergence of infl uenza A H5N1 and H1N1 outbreaks has led to common eff orts to strengthen epidemiological surveillance and stockpiling of antiviral drugs. Enthusiasm for regional economic collaboration continues to grow, evident from the explicit goal of the ASEAN Free Trade Area to increase the region's competitive advantage as a production base geared towards the world market. ASEAN leaders have identifi ed health care as a priority sector for region-wide integration. From an economic perspective, opening of health-care markets promises substantial economic gains. At the same time, however, this process could also intensify existing challenges in promotion of equitable access to health care within countries. It could also lead to undesirable outcomes whereby only the better-off will receive benefi ts from the liberalisation of trade policy in health.\n\nHealth and trade policy can and do appear to contradict each other. Tobacco use is the major preventable cause of non-communicable disease and death among the populations of ASEAN countries. 68 All ASEAN members except Indonesia have embraced the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) 69 and all countries endorse some form of tobacco control policy. However, most of these states are, to varying degrees, still involved in investment in or promotion of the tobacco industry, often using the justifi cation of poverty alleviation. There are clear contradictions inherent in the state seeking to prevent tobacco use in the interests of health, while actively promoting tobacco for the economic benefi t of its population, resulting in both substantial and symbolic harm to eff orts to implement the FCTC. 70 For example, tobacco production is legitimised; rational policy principles are violated, and direct cooperation between the state and multinational tobacco corporations is made possible by modifi cation of control policies. Tobacco exports within ASEAN also threaten the group's health solidarity. Divestiture of state ownership of capital in tobacco corporations 71 and a much stronger commitment by states to control the use and promotion of tobacco are urgently required in ASEAN countries.\n\nIssues of intellectual property rights surrounding products such as essential pharmaceutical drugs as public health goods are also of concern to countries. Thailand started compulsory drug licensing in 2008. Indonesia has called for the urgent development of a new system for virus access and a fair and equitable sharing of the benefi ts arising from the use of the infl uenza virus in research (now commonly referred to as viral sovereignty). Additionally, Indonesia has pressed for the development of medical products to replace the existing patent system in global health governance. 72 With globalisation, ensuring of accessible health services for citizens is no longer the sole responsibility of the state; health care in southeast Asia is fast becoming an industry in the world market. The private sectors in Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia have capitalised on their comparative advantage to promote medical tourism and travel, combining health services for wealthy foreigners with recreational packages to boost consumption of such health services. Patients from elsewhere, including the developed countries, are choosing to travel for medical treatment, which is perceived to be high quality and value for money. Because of poor local economic conditions, the Philippines had a policy to export human resources for health to the world and to richer countries in the region as an income-generating mechanism. Although the fi nancial returns from this strategy seem substantial, equity issues have surfaced concerning the negative eff ects of international trade in health services and workforce migration on national health systems, especially in widening disparities in the rural-urban or public-private mix.\n\nRegional collaboration in standards of data collection and health systems analysis is hampered by WHO's division of the ASEAN region into two areas under separate regional offi ces: the South-East Asia Regional Offi ce, encompassing Indonesia, Myanmar, and Thailand, and the Western Pacifi c Regional Offi ce, consisting of the remaining countries. Potential benefi ts from enhanced WHO regional cooperation include improved health surveillance, information-sharing, and health systems strengthening in all ASEAN countries.\n\nSoutheast Asia is a region characterised by much diversity, including public health challenges. Social, political, and economic development during the past few decades has facilitated substantial health gains in some countries, and smaller changes in others. The geology of the region, making it highly susceptible to earthquakes and resultant tsunamis, along with seasonal typhoons and fl oods, further increases health risks to the population from natural disasters and longterm eff ects of climate change. Public policy in these countries cannot ignore such risks to health, which could have important social and economic consequences. Regional cooperation around disaster preparedness and in the surveillance of and health systems response to disease outbreaks has obvious advantages as a public health strategy. Concomi tantly, all countries in the region are faced with large or looming chronic disease epidemics. Even in the poorest populations of the region, non-communicable diseases already kill more people than do communicable, maternal, and perinatal conditions combined, with many of these deaths occurring before old age. Greatly strengthened health promotion and disease prevention strategies are an urgent priority if the impressive health gains of the past few decades in most countries of the region are to be replicated. Further growth and integration of the ASEAN region should include as a priority enhanced regional cooperation in the health sector to share knowledge and rationalise health systems operations, leading to further public health gains for the region's diverse populations.\n\nAll authors contributed to data collection, interpretation, writing, and revision of the report.\n\nWe declare that we have no confl icts of interest."}
