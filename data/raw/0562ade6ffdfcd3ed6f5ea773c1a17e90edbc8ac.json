{"title": "RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS CHAPTER 31 Epidemiology of Respiratory Infections", "body": "The inclusion of nucleic acid technologies (e.g., polymerase chain reaction [PCR] ) for the detection of respiratory virus infections in children has substantially increased the diagnostic sensitivity for most respiratory viruses. [5] [6] [7] This technology has allowed the recovery of viruses that have been diffi cult to detect by conventional methods. 8 For example, PCR is three to fi ve times as sensitive as cell culture for detecting rhinoviruses. 9,10 Figure 31-1 shows the viral identifi cation breakdown in three recent studies of children 5, 11, 12 in different countries over the winter viral season using PCR techniques. This fi gure illustrates the differences between studies in patient sampling and methods and the consequent differences in results. However, in all three studies, rhinovirus and RSV are the dominant viruses, with the relative proportions of each differing even between the two studies in infants (studies A and B). Mixed viral infections, particularly with rhinovirus, are common. Finally, studies fi nd only the organisms they look for-only study C tested for bocavirus.\n\nMolecular methods have also allowed the rapid identifi cation and characterization of previously unknown viruses causing respiratory illness. The human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was fi rst identifi ed in the Netherlands in 2000 13 and shows a wide geographic distribution. 14,15 Five new human coronaviruses have been discovered, 16 including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV), 17, 18 human coronavirus NL63 (hCoV-NL63), 19 and human coronavirus HKU1 (hCo-HKU1). 20 Another virus, the human bocavirus (hBoV), has also been identifi ed in association with respiratory illness in hospitalized patients. 21\n\nStudies using conventional virology have detected multiple respiratory viruses in 1.8% to 15.8% of acute LRIs. 22 While more recent studies using nucleic acid technologies have identifi ed multiple viruses in up to 27% of hospitalized\n\n\u2022 Technological developments in molecular biology are showing that known respiratory viruses are more prevalent than previously thought across the childhood age range. New viruses continue to be discovered in association with acute respiratory tract infections. \u2022 The study of morbidity and mortality that is due to acute lower respiratory tract infection is hampered by lack of precise defi nitions and specifi c, practical diagnostic methods. \u2022 Children in developing countries account for at least 70% of the global burden and mortality from acute lower respiratory tract infection. \u2022 Malnutrition, poverty, indoor smoke, and comorbid conditions, including malaria, tuberculosis, and human immunodefi ciency virus infection, greatly increase the risks of children acquiring and dying from acute lower respiratory tract infection. \u2022 Emerging respiratory diseases present an ongoing risk for children in an era of globalization. Legg et al. 11 Denominator: 123 RTIs in a cohort of 88 infants with at least one atopic parent, followed in Southampton, UK. Specimens: nasal lavage. \n\nlate in a community every year; however, some, especially infl uenza type B and the parainfl uenza viruses, may cause epidemics at biennial or longer intervals. 3 Different viruses also predominate in a community during different seasons of the year; overlap invariably occurs and the actual timing and severity of each outbreak or epidemic can vary from year to year. In tropical climates, seasonality also exists. In these regions, RSV occurs predominantly in the rainy season, whereas infl uenza activity occurs throughout the year with a marked peak in activity during the dry season and a lesser peak during the rainy season. 27,28 Seasons of both higher and lower temperature have been associated with these viruses in different countries. 27 The reasons for the seasonality of respiratory virus infections and their variation by latitude are not clear. More important than the environmental conditions themselves may be their effect on behavior. Seasons when people spend more time indoors, in closer contact with other people (colloquially called \"closed-in season\" in some regions), will favor more rapid person-to-person transmission.\n\nRespiratory viruses cause infections in children at specifi c ages. RSV causes the most severe LRI in children less than 1 year of age, with a peak occurring at a mean age of 3 months. 29 The peak age for hMPV infection is later than that for RSV, 30 but the majority of children have had clinical or subclinical infection by 2 years of age. Similarly, hPIV infections occur at an older peak age than RSV. Human parainfl uenza virus-1 causes LRIs predominantly in infants aged 7 to 36 months, with peak infection occurring in the second and third years of life. The peak infection of hPIV-2 occurs in the second year of life, but hPIV-3 differs in that it infects infants younger than 6 months and most children experience infection in the fi rst year of life. All age groups are at risk of infection from infl uenza type A and B viruses, but preschoolage children in day care and school-age children have the highest infection rates. 31 The very young, the elderly, and those with chronic conditions experience more severe disease. Rhinoviruses and coronaviruses commonly cause URI and infect individuals many times throughout their lives. Rhinoviruses are also clearly associated with LRI in children, but their role remains to be elucidated. 32\n\nThe common respiratory viruses are often associated with specifi c clinical syndromes, although most can cause infection at any level in the human respiratory tract. RSV is clearly the most important pathogen associated with bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infancy, 33 but it can infect all age groups, causing infl uenza-like illness. 34 Infection of young children with hMPV, a newly described virus, causes illness that resembles hRSV bronchiolitis but also upper respiratory tract disease and diarrhea with fever. 13, [35] [36] [37] [38] Metapneumovirus now surpasses the parainfl uenza viruses as the second most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia among young children.\n\nThe parainfl uenza viruses (hPIV 1-4) are also an important cause of LRIs and regularly cause pneumonia, bronchiolitis, and croup among infants and young children. The most frequent are hPIV-1 and hPIV-2 infections. hPIV-1 is most \n\ncommonly associated with croup, whereas hPIV-3 is an important cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young infants. hPIV-2 is most commonly associated with croup, but all respiratory syndromes have been described. Studies rarely identify hPIV-4, although this virus has also been associated with all respiratory syndromes. 39 Infl uenza viruses can cause any of the typical respiratory syndromes. Very young infants often present with fever only and no specifi c lower respiratory tract symptoms. School-age children and adolescents most often present with symptoms of classic infl uenza (i.e., febrile tracheobronchitis with myalgia and cough). 1 The most common lower respiratory syndrome caused by adenoviruses is pneumonia, but all syndromes can occur. 40 Damage to bronchial architecture can occur with certain adenovirus strains, leading to life-threatening infections, and to bronchiolitis obliterans and bronchiectasis.\n\nRhinoviruses are the most ubiquitous respiratory pathogens. They cause the majority of cases of the common cold and may also commonly be associated with LRIs in children and adults. 32 The coronaviruses (hCoV-229E and hCoV-OC43) are a frequent cause of URIs in children and adults. 41 Human bocavirus 42 and the newer coronaviruses (hCoV-NL63 and hCo-HKU1) 16, 19, 43 have been associated with respiratory tract infection in children, but their epidemiology remains to be fully elucidated.\n\nPneumonia: Infl ammation of the lung with consolidation. 44 The term is usually used to indicate infection (most commonly bacterial or viral) of the lung parenchyma resulting in obliteration of alveolar air space by purulent exudate. ARI or clinical pneumonia: These terms are commonly used in studies in developing countries for a clinical diagnosis of infection of the lower respiratory tract (below the larynx) based on the three signs of fever, cough, and rapid breathing. Other signs, such as grunting, indrawing, bronchial breathing, auscultatory crackles, etc., may or may not be present. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP): This term is most commonly used in studies in developed countries and usually includes a radiological fi nding of pneumonia. Used in distinction to hospital-acquired pneumonia, which follows injury, surgery, immobility, or immunosuppression or is due to unusual hospital pathogens.\n\nTo prove a diagnosis of \"pneumonia\" according to the fi rst, pathologic defi nition requires proof that there is infection of the lung parenchyma and proof that there is airspace consolidation. The defi nition of ARI or clinical pneumonia, on the other hand, relies on clinical signs only and requires no such proof. The chief diffi culty in studying cases of pneumonia, especially for epidemiologists, is that of reconciling these two defi nitions. Why is this important? When we describe the epidemiology of clinical pneumonia we need to know:\n\n\u2022 What is the relationship between the condition we are describing and the more objective pathologic entity of pneumonia? (Validity)\n\n\u2022 How confi dent are we that the studies we collect in our description are identifying the same condition?\n\nThe diffi culties inherent in answering these two questions include the following.\n\n1. Limitations of identifying the organism: Clinical signs and symptoms provide only a limited guide to the many possible organisms causing a respiratory infection. Different organisms require different types of sample and different specialized laboratory identifi cation methods, few of which are in routine use, even in developed countries. For example, sensitive detection of RSV, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis requires, respectively, immunofl uorescent antigen detection on nasopharyngeal swab or aspirate, bacterial culture of lung biopsy tissue, and inoculation of bronchoalveolar lavage or gastric aspirate specimens into liquid broth with subsequent confi rmation by PCR speciation. 2. Limitations of identifying consolidation: Chest radiography accurately identifi es established pathologic consolidation but may miss early infection. However, as with microbial diagnosis, radiology is not routinely necessary for clinical management and is not consistently performed during respiratory infections. 3. Limitations of availability of facilities and expertise: Clinical, laboratory, and radiology facilities and diagnostic expertise are distributed in a very patchy fashion throughout the world. In many parts of the developing world, diagnosis and case management rely on poorly resourced village health workers with the support of a central clinic.\n\nOften, these are the regions with the highest incidence, morbidity, and mortality from childhood respiratory infection.\n\nThe diffi culties and limitations of identifying ARI by microbial cause and radiologic consolidation, particularly in developing countries, have forced epidemiologists to develop tools using clinical pattern recognition to estimate the burden of respiratory disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) guideline for the management of ARIs and pneumonia ( Fig. 31 -3) was developed by Shann and others 45, 46 in Papua, New Guinea, from 1980 onward. The aim was a simple stepby-step instruction in recognizing and treating respiratory infection, requiring minimal training, and usable by health workers in developing countries. By 1994, 130 developing countries were using the protocol with or without modifi cation. 47 The guideline has been incorporated into the global Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) program, 48 which had been adopted by 81 developing countries by 2000. For these reasons, the WHO guideline has become an important tool for measuring the incidence and mortality due to ARI. If referral is NOT possible:\n\n\u2022 Give IM chloramphenicol for 5 days followed by 5 days of oral antibiotic therapy.\n\nThe modifi ed WHO case management guideline for acute respiratory illness. (Used with permission. This chart and its explanation can be found at http://www.who.int/child-adolescent-health/Emergencies/ARI_chart.pdf.)\n\nThe strengths of the WHO case management guideline for epidemiological study of ARI are as follows:\n\n\u2022 Minimal training required, needing no specialized facilities; therefore, low cost and wide applicability across geopolitical and socioeconomic boundaries \u2022 Proved effective as a basis for management and reducing mortality A meta-analysis of nine community-based trials 49,50 has shown that application of the WHO case management system reduced pneumonia mortality by 36% and total mortality by 24% in the 0-to 4-year-old age group (Fig. 31-4) . The impact is most likely due to improved recognition of antibiotic treatable pneumonia due to S. pneumoniae and H. infl uenzae, but identifi cation of malnutrition and other health factors may also contribute. Compared to a radiologic defi nition of pneumonia, the WHO guideline lacks specifi city due to:\n\n1. Lack of distinction between viral bronchiolitis, virusassociated asthma, and viral or bacterial pneumonia 2. Possible inclusion of the following: \u2022 Measles and malaria in high prevalence areas, because they can also cause rapid breathing or may be comorbid with pneumonia 51-53 \u2022 Bacteremia due to nontyphoidal salmonella, 54,55 despite lack of evidence of lung tissue infection due to these organisms 56 \u2022 Any other cause of rapid breathing such as cardiac failure 57 3. Respiratory rate, a key element of the WHO criteria, may be raised by increased body temperature 53,58 and high altitude 59 and lowered by malnutrition. 47, 60 In two studies in The Gambia 61 and Peru, 62 radiographs confi rmed pneumonia in 24% and 36% of cases, respectively, identifi ed by WHO criteria.\n\nThe \"verbal autopsy,\" commonly used for gathering mortality data in developed countries, consists of a questionnaire (including the WHO criteria for ARI) administered to families about the fi nal illness. This is a simple method of obtain-\n\ning circumstantial data regarding causes of death without the cultural problems often associated with medical autopsy. Verbal autopsies have a range of reported sensitivity for pneumonia of 28% to 72% and specifi city of 60% to 90%. 49 Limitations of the verbal autopsy are similar to those listed for the WHO guideline; such as possible inclusion of deaths from malaria (where prevalent) among deaths from ARI 63 and frequent confounding of cause of death by comorbidities such as malnutrition, measles, or human immunodefi ciency virus (HIV) infection in poor countries. 49 ARI is an associated cause or fi nal mode of death even more often than it is a direct cause of death. 64\n\nWe should bear in mind the sensitivity and specifi city of the tool used when comparing data. Compared with children in developed countries, children in developing countries have high exposure to risk factors, high rates of bacterial infection, low access to medical care, and high incidence of and mortality from pneumonia. The WHO criteria for ARI have been deliberately chosen to have high sensitivity, accepting the cost of lower specifi city. This may have the effect of exaggerating differences in estimates of ARI between developed and developing countries. On the other hand, many researchers state that their best estimates of ARI in developing countries remain conservative and are likely to underestimate the rates. These differences in method should be kept in mind when discussing the estimates below.\n\nGlobal estimates and national estimates of ARI incidence and mortality usually depend on data derived indirectly by curve fi tting, extrapolation, and applying one proportion to another. Studies at different time points and using different methods may be included. Many of the incidence studies go back to the 1980s, 65 whereas mortality estimates are based on more recent total and cause-specifi c mortality data.\n\nThe majority of international studies of the epidemiology of ARIs deal with children under the age of 5 years. There are fewer data for older age groups; nonetheless, several studies 66,67 have shown a decreasing incidence with age. For the remainder of this section, we confi ne our discussion to the child less than 5 years of age.\n\nRudan and associates 65 recently estimated worldwide incidence for ARI in children under 5 years of age. They performed a meta-analysis of 28 studies completed mostly in the late 1980s in developing countries. They sought to confi rm the directly reported rates in these studies with indirectly calculated rates using case-fatality, rates of severe pneumonia, and case-fatality of severe pneumonia. Their best estimate for the incidence of ARI in the developing world was 0.29 events per child-year, or 150.7 million new cases of ARI per year, of which 11 to 20 million are severe enough to require hospital admission. Rudan and associates were unable to fi nd studies for the developed world that used active surveillance and WHO criteria for ARI. They based their estimate of 0.026 event per child-year (or 2.1 million cases of pneumonia per year) on four large population-based studies of community-acquired pneumonia in the United States and Europe.\n\nThe recent UNICEF/WHO report on pneumonia 68 indicates that in 2004, 15 countries accounted for three quarters of childhood pneumonia cases worldwide, amounting to approximately 113 million cases. These countries, and the estimated number of cases in 2004, were India (44 million), China (18 million), Nigeria and Pakistan (7 million each), Bangladesh and Indonesia (6 million each), Brazil and Ethiopia (4 million each), Democratic Republic of the Congo and Philippines (3 million each), followed by Afghanistan, Egypt, Mexico, Sudan, and Vietnam (2 million each).\n\nBy country, the percentage of annual deaths of children under 5 years that are due to ARI is related in a logarithmic fashion to the total under 5-year mortality (Fig. 31-5 ). 49 Figure 31 -6 shows the estimated percentage range of deaths from lower ARI among children of each country in 2000. 49 These data were estimated by extrapolating to the year 2000 the 1999 WHO total under-5 mortality data by country, and using the blue fi tted curve in Figure 31 -5 to estimate the percentage of deaths due to ARI. The authors estimated that between 1.6 and 2.2 million children died of ARI in 2000 and that 40% of these deaths occurred in Africa and 30% occurred in Southeast Asia. Mortality from ARI in excess of 25% of total under-5 deaths was estimated for Afghanistan, Sierra Leone, and Niger. The regions with the lowest proportions of deaths due to ARI were in Western Europe, North America, and Australasia. Other respiratory deaths in young children, estimated for 1998, fell into the following categories: upper respiratory infection and otitis media-37,000, neonatal pneumonia-215,500, pertussis-287,000, measles-594,700, and AIDS-associated ARI-87,500. 69 Table 31 -2 gives an updated summary of mortality due to ARI from the WHO 2005 report 70 by region averaged for the years 2000 to 2003. The numbers have slightly increased but are otherwise similar to those of Williams and associates. 49 Table 31 -3 gives a summary of global statistics for ARI in children under 5 years of age, divided into those for the developing and those for the developed world. These fi gures are based on Rudan and colleagues 65 and the recent UNICEF/ WHO report. 68 If for the moment we ignore the potential errors due to the limitations mentioned above, it would seem that 90% of the child deaths from ARI occur in the developing world, with 75% of them in Africa and Southeast Asia. ARIs constitute about 20% of total mortality in the developing world but only 2% of total mortality in the developed areas of Europe, the Western Pacifi c, and the Americas. The differences in estimation and comparison are unlikely to have caused such large discrepancies.\n\nTable 31-4 shows well-established risk factors for developing ARI or pneumonia. Risk factors such as malnutrition are prevalent in developing countries, whereas vehicle emissions may be higher in developed countries.\n\nRisk factors for dying from ARI (almost all from pneumonia) include most of the same factors, but comorbid diseases (especially diarrhea, malaria, measles, tuberculosis, and HIV infection) further increase the mortality risk. 49,71 Lack of adequate health care is also an important associated factor in Where there is access to health care, the cost of life-saving treatment for pneumonia is relatively small. According to a Lancet editorial in 2003, 72 26% of the world's children under the age of 2 do not receive basic diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccination, 58% do not receive exclusive breastfeeding for the fi rst 4 months of life, 25% have malnutrition, and 40% do not receive appropriate antibiotic treatment for pneumonia. These risk factors are of course bound together by many strands within communities. As Bawaskar 73 has pointed out, illiteracy is a major factor in infant malnutrition, and low income and illiteracy are enmeshed with impoverished, unsanitary and crowded living conditions, high rates of HIV infection, and lack of access to health care. \n\nLow birth weight/prematurity Low family income / parent education level <5 years old, and especially <1 year old \u2193 Access to clean water, sanitation, clothing, housing, health care, immunizations\n\nLarge families, late-birth order children, early child care groups, peri-urban slums Kwashiorkor/marasmus\n\nUse of biomass fuel (wood products, refuse, dung)\n\nTobacco smoke exposure Left-to-right shunt/heart failure \n\nBlack and colleagues 71 have estimated that as many as 50% of the deaths from ARI/pneumonia in children are attributable to being underweight (Fig. 31-7) . A study in Costa Rica in the early 1970s documented a 12-fold increased risk (71% versus 6%, respectively) of pneumonia among malnourished compared with normally nourished children. 74 Rice and coworkers 75 presented a comprehensive review of the recent literature regarding the effects of malnutrition on death from diarrhea, ARI, malaria, and measles. They summarized three community studies and 12 facility-based studies. The results were consistent across all studies showing a major association between death from ARI and low weightfor-age (W/A) Z-scores or median W/A less than 80% of median. The odds ratios, risk ratios, or relative risks of dying from respiratory infection compared with that for normally nourished children ranged very widely from single fi gures up to an odds ratio of 26 for W/A Z-score = \u22122.0 (compared with >0) in a Brazilian study and an adjusted relative risk of 27 for children whose W/A was less than 60% of the local reference median (compared to \u226590%) in a Philippines study. All studies that analyzed risks by degree of malnutrition found a dose-response effect. Figure 31 -8, taken from Victora and colleagues 76 and based on Kirkwood and colleagues, 77 shows that 84% of deaths from pneumonia occur in the fi rst 18 months of life and indicates the potential impacts of nutritional problems at different ages. Victora and colleagues' estimated reduction in pneumonia mortality by region and by intervention is shown in Table 31 -5.\n\nGraham and coworkers 78 have summarized recent data for the respiratory effects of HIV infection in African children. Approximately 90% of the HIV-infected children in the world come from sub-Saharan Africa. HIV infection greatly increases the incidence of and mortality from pulmonary disease, mostly in children under 5 years. Conversely respiratory disorders are the most common cause of death in HIVinfected African children. For children hospitalized for severe pneumonia, HIV-infected children in Malawi were three times as likely to die, and in South Africa six times as likely to die, as were non-HIV-infected children.\n\nThe high incidence of opportunistic infections (such as HIV infection is commonly associated with other risk factors for pneumonia including poverty and malnutrition, such as children with marasmus. 78 As a result, it can be diffi cult to determine the relative importance of the HIV infection compared with other risk factors in determining the nature and outcome of pneumonia in regions with high HIV prevalence.\n\nAmong causes of ARIs in young children, the two organisms responsible for the largest number of cases (and 70% of the deaths) 57 are S. pneumoniae and H. infl uenzae, the latter including nontypable strains, type B (Hib), and sometimes other typable strains. 79 We now have the means to prevent pneumonia due to Hib and to many strains of S. pneumoniae. Madhi and colleagues 80 demonstrated that Soweto children (both HIV positive and negative) immunized with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine had 31% fewer episodes of virusassociated pneumonia compared with placebo controls. This seems to imply that virus-associated pneumonia commonly involves mixed infections with bacteria.\n\nIsolation rates of S. pneumoniae in pneumonia are very dependent on sample and identifi cation method and are highly variable in studies in developing and developed countries. 79, 81 Berman 82 reported an overall isolation rate of 27% in 14 studies, and 60% of the studies reported isolation rates greater than 30%. The estimated incidence of pneumonia due to S. pneumoniae also varies greatly. Incidence rates from 18.1 to almost 200 per 100,000 children per year have been described in developing countries. 79, 83, 84 Incidence rates estimated in Southern California were 17 per 100,000 per year in 1996. 67, 85 Serotypes 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 14, 15, 18, 19, and 23 are common in both developing and developed countries. 79 Despite the frequency of isolation of S. pneumoniae, there are few specifi c estimates of pneumonia mortality due to this organism.\n\nThe peak season for pneumococcal pneumonia in developed countries is winter 66,86 (Fig. 31-9) , closely corresponding to peak isolation rates of RSV and infl uenza. In tropical countries, studies have reported either little seasonal variation 84 or small peaks in the hot season and the monsoon season 83 (Fig. 31-10) . The peaks observed could be explained either by secondary infection on the heels of seasonal viral infections or (in parallel to virus infections) by increased interpersonal transmission of bacteria during seasons when people spend more time indoors.\n\nStudies in developing countries have indicated that both total child mortality and mortality due to pneumonia could be lowered by the use of pneumococcal vaccines. Black and coworkers, 87 in a double-blind randomized controlled trial of heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in California, reported a 32.2% reduction in pneumonia with positive radiographs in children under 1 year, 23.4% in children under 2 years, and 9.1% in children over 2 years old. Cutts and coworkers 88 have reported a randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial of nine-valent pneumococcal conju- \n\ngate vaccine in Gambian infants less than 1 year old. They estimated (based on intention-to-treat analyses) a reduction in fi rst episodes of pneumonia of 6%, reduction of admissions to hospital of 13%, reduction of admissions due to potentially invasive pneumococcal disease of 19%, and reduction in allcause mortality of 14%. Vaccine effi cacy was 77% against invasive pneumococcal disease due to vaccine-related serotypes and 50% against invasive disease due to all serotypes.\n\nLevine and coworkers, 89 in a 1998 review, estimated that H. infl uenzae (all strains) caused 16% of all pneumonia deaths not due to measles or pertussis or 482,000 deaths from pneumonia each year in children under 5 years in developing countries. Peltola 90 conservatively estimated the annual prevaccination incidence of Hib pneumonia in children under 5 years in developing countries at 300 per 100,000 based on Gambian studies in the 1990s. 90,91 This represents 1.7 million cases and 220,00 to 400,000 deaths with a case-fatality rate of 13% to 24%. In developed countries, Peltola estimated a prevaccination incidence of 6 per 100,000, representing 5000 cases, 250 deaths, and a case-fatality rate of 5%. Nontypable strains have been found to be as commonly or more commonly associated with pneumonia in several studies, 79,90 but only in developing countries. Levine and colleagues 89 reported that Hib accounted for a mean of 35% of all H. infl uenzae pneumonia cases in three studies of all H. infl uenzae pneumonias but for a mean of 71% of bacteremic H. infl uenzae pneumonias in eight studies. If most deaths occur in bacteremic pneumonia, as is supposed, then Hib may be responsible for up to 70% of the deaths from H. infl uenzae pneumonia in under-5 children.\n\nVaccination for H. infl uenzae type B has dramatically reduced all causes of invasive Hib in the developed world 92 (Fig. 31-11) .\n\nTrials of Hib conjugate vaccine in developing countries have included prospective case-control studies in Chile 93 and Brazil 94 and a double-blind randomized placebo controlled trial in The Gambia. 95 Vaccine effi cacy in young children ranges from 21% to 31% against radiology-confi rmed pneumonia from all causes in these studies. The Gambian study showed reduction of oropharyngeal carriage of Hib. 96 Levine and co-workers in 1998 89 estimated the potential impact of routine immunization of infants with 3 doses of Hib conjugate vaccine in developing countries (Table 31-6) . The estimates include all Hib disease (the majority being pneumonia and meningitis). They suggested that 60% of deaths and 67% of cases would be prevented if no herd immunity were operative. In the presence of herd immunity over 300,000 deaths (83% of deaths) and 2.5 million cases (85% of cases) might be prevented. Miller 97 estimated that among Asian countries, about 136,000 (87%) Hib deaths could be prevented annually with incorporation of Hib vaccine into the immunization programs at a cost of between 0.1% and 3.0% of per capita gross national product per child younger than 5 years. However, a recent Hib vaccine probe trial among 55,073 children in Lombok, Indonesia, 98 found no protective effect against radiologyconfi rmed pneumonia despite a protective effect against clinically defi ned pneumonia and against meningitis. Various reasons are discussed in the paper and the accompanying editorial. 99\n\nARI and pneumonia contribute a massive burden of death and morbidity to young children and much more so in developing countries than in developed countries. Vaccination strategies to prevent disease are well proved for single-agent diseases with obligate human hosts. However, vaccine implementation, acceptance, and coverage are always going to offer challenges when different political, economic, health, and cultural systems have to be engaged. Other major factors that will be required to decrease the morbidity and mortality due to ARI in children must include the reduction or eradication of poverty, malnutrition, and HIV infection and improve- ments in air quality through reduction of smoke exposure from cigarettes and biomass fuels.\n\nInfectious diseases are the leading cause of death among young people under the age of 50 years. 100 The complex matrix of these diseases from endemic diseases, which pose an ongoing threat, through to new emerging and reemerging diseases that present new challenges 101 is shown in Figure  31 -12. Respiratory pathogens, including SARS, infl uenza, and tuberculosis, are some of the emerging and reemerging threats that have recently received or are receiving ongoing attention as global public health concerns. These infections, many of which are zoonotic in origin, are creating unprecedented challenges, and spurring the development of new approaches. The application of epidemiology simulation modeling to identify the best public health responses under a variety of conditions 102 and for specifi c interventions with pandemic infl uenza 103 are examples.\n\nOf all the viruses that infect the human respiratory tract, infl uenza viruses cause the predominant number of serious acute respiratory tract illnesses. 104 There are three types of infl uenza virus, A, B, and C, of which the infl uenza A and B 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 \n\nEpidemics of infl uenza occur almost every year. They are caused by new variants of infl uenza A and B viruses that have evolved through antigenic drift, allowing them to evade the host's immune defenses. This requires regular updates of the composition in infl uenza vaccines. In countries with temperate climates infl uenza activity peaks during the winter months with infl uenza A epidemics occurring every 1 to 2 years and infl uenza B circulating every 2 to 4 years.\n\nInfl uenza incidence and illness are high in children. Attack rates can be 40% or more in preschool-aged children and 30% in school-age children, which is higher than the 10% to 20% rate commonly observed in young adults. 26,33,107-109\n\nChildren have an important role in spreading infl uenza. School provides an ideal environment for the spread of respiratory viruses, and school-age children serve as the main channels through which infl uenza A and B virus infections are introduced into households. 107, 109, 110 Exacerbations of COPD in adults were found to be correlated with epidemics of viral infections including infl uenza A and B in school children and to decline during school holidays. 111 In young children, infl u- \n\nThe estimated TB incidence globally is shown in Figure  31 -15. 140 The largest number of cases occurs in the Southeast Asia region (190 cases per 100,000 population), which accounts for 33% of incident cases globally; however, in sub-Saharan Africa, the incidence per capita is nearly twice that of Southeast Asia, given by the WHO at 356 cases per 100,000 population in 2004. 139 The WHO also estimated that 1.69 million deaths (27 deaths per 100,000 population) resulted from TB in 2004. 139 As with cases of disease, the highest number of estimated deaths is in the Southeast Asia region, but the highest mortal-ity per capita (78 deaths per 100,000 population) is in sub-Sahaian, Africa, where HIV has led to rapid increases in the incidence of TB and increases the likelihood of dying from TB ( Fig. 31-16) . 140 TB accounts for about 13% of AIDS deaths worldwide. 141\n\nDrug-resistant TB is on the increase in many parts of the world. 142 The development of resistance is a result of inconsistent or partial treatment of cases. Of particular concern is multidrug-resistant TB, which is defi ned as resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin, the two most effective anti-TB drugs. It is estimated that 300,000 new cases of multidrug-resistant TB are developing each year. 139"}
