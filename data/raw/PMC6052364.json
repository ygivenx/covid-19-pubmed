{"title": "Nucleocapsid protein from porcine epidemic diarrhea virus isolates can antagonize interferon-\u03bb production by blocking the nuclear factor-\u03baB nuclear translocation*\n", "body": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), one of the most severe and globally widespread infectious diseases in all ages of swine (Song and Park, 2012), is caused by the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). As a member of the Coronaviridae family, PEDV infects mainly the epithelial cells of the porcine intestine, leading to acute diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration (Jung and Saif, 2015). The high morbidity and mortality in newborn piglets caused by PEDV infection can lead to significant economic loss and serious animal welfare issues. Thus, a better understanding of the genetic characteristics and molecular pathogenesis of PEDV is urgently needed for vaccine development and PED control. PEDV possesses genes encoding structural spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins in the 3' one-third of the genome (Lee, 2015). Epitopes of the N protein have been suggested to be of great importance in cell-mediated immunity (CMI) induction (Saif, 1993).\n\nInterferons (IFNs), especially type I and III IFNs, play crucial roles in antiviral host defense (Ank et al., 2006; Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006). Type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) are reported to be crucial factors of innate immunity in response to various coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Spiegel et al., 2004), transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) (Charley and Laude, 1988), and mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHC) (Roth-Cross et al., 2008; Li et al., 2010). The recently discovered type III IFN-\u03bb might contribute to mucosal innate immunity induced by infection of various RNA viruses including Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), mouse hepatitis coronavirus, and lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) (Sommereyns et al., 2008). The IFN-\u03bb family in humans consists of four members (IFN-\u03bb1, IFN-\u03bb2, IFN-\u03bb3, and IFN-\u03bb4) (Wack et al., 2015), whereas swine expresses only IFN-\u03bb1 and IFN-\u03bb3 (Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006; Sang et al., 2010). Li et al. (2017) also proved that both recombinant porcine IFN-\u03bb1 (rpIFN-\u03bb1) and rpIFN-\u03bb3 exhibit robust antiviral activity against PEDV proliferation in vitro. However, the molecular mechanism by which PEDV proliferation is inhibited by IFN-\u03bb has not yet been determined.\n\nVarious viruses, including coronavirus, have evolved ingenious mechanisms to respond against the antiviral response of IFN (Lu et al., 2011; Ding Q et al., 2012; Wen et al., 2013; Ding Z et al., 2014). N protein is known to be an important IFN antagonist in many coronaviruses (Ye et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2011; Ding et al., 2014). Lu et al. (2011) confirmed that the N protein of SARS-CoV dramatically inhibited the expression of IFN-\u03b2 from a nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) responsive promoter. MHC N protein was reported to play a crucial role in circumventing the innate immunoresponse by antagonizing type I IFN (Ye et al., 2007). PEDV N protein was shown to block IFN-\u03b2 production in HEK-293T cells by targeting the TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) to inhibit its interaction with the critical transcription factors NF-\u03baB and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) (Ding et al., 2014). Only N protein and papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) of PEDV have been demonstrated as IFN antagonists (Ding et al., 2014). However, it remains to be determined whether the N protein of PEDV functions as an IFN-\u03bb antagonist. Therefore, in this study, we used IPEC-J2 cells to investigate the effect of PEDV N protein on the production of IFN-\u03bb to give a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the porcine host-pathogen interaction, which could help to identify novel therapeutic targets and develop effective vaccines against PEDV.\n\nThe Vero E6 cell line was used to isolate and passage virus. Vero cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) supplemented with antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 \u03bcg/ml amphotericin B) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, USA).\n\nThe IPEC-J2 cell line was kindly provided by Prof. Jie FENG (Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China) and cultured in DMEM supplemented with antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 \u03bcg/ml amphotericin B) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, USA).\n\nThe PEDV strains were isolated from clinically diseased pigs in China. Briefly, intestinal tissues were homogenized in Earle\u2019s balanced salt solution (Sigma, USA) and centrifuged to obtain supernatants. The supernatants were then filtered through a 0.22-\u03bcm-pore filter and used as inoculum for virus isolation. The supernatants were used to inoculate Vero cells. After incubating for 4 h, the inoculum was replaced with DMEM supplemented with antibiotics and trypsin (5 \u03bcg/ml). The Vero cells were frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C and thawed once when 80% of cells presented cytopathogenic effects (CPEs). The cells and medium were mixed, and then centrifuged to obtain supernatant for secondary inoculation. For serial passaging, virus was gradually increased. Finally, flasks were used for propagation and isolated PEDV strains as seed stock.\n\nThe sub-cloning vector pEASYBlunt (Transgene, China) was used to clone N genes from different PEDV strains. The luciferase reporter vectors pGL3 and pRL-TK were purchased from Promega (USA). Luciferase reporter vector pGL3-PIFN-\u03bb3 was constructed by inserting the promoter region of IFN-\u03bb3 into the pGL3 backbone vector. The 1517-bp promoter region was predicted by an online prediction server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/Promoter) using the 5-kb upstream sequence of swine IFN-\u03bb3 gene. The eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1-flag vector was constructed and maintained by our laboratory (Zhou et al., 2017). The 13SX0101 strain was chosen randomly from the isolated strains for N gene cloning. The N gene from strain 13SX1101 was cloned into the pcDNA3.1-flag using ClonExpress II One Step Cloning Kit (Vazyme, China) to produce the pcDNA3-N expression vector. All the primers used in this study are listed in Table 1.\n\nThe Viral Total RNA Kit (Labserv, China) and Reverse Transcription Kit (Vazyme, China) were used for virus RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, respectively. Specific primers were designed to amplify N genes from cDNA of isolated PEDV strains. The purified PCR products were cloned into the pEASYBlunt plasmid for sequencing. The nucleotide sequences of N genes from ten isolates were submitted to GenBank (accession numbers MF118911\u2013MF118920). Nucleotide sequences and amino acid sequences were aligned and an amino acid phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA6.0 software and the ClustalW method.\n\nFor Luc-assays, IPEC-J2 cells were seeded in 24-well plates and co-transfected with 1 \u03bcg pRL-TK and 1 \u03bcg luciferase reporter vector pGL3-PIFN-\u03bb3. After 24 h, cells were then transfected with 0.5 \u03bcg polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) and 1 \u03bcg pcDNA3-N. For quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays and immunofluorescence assays, IPEC-J2 cells were seeded in 24-well plates and co-transfected with 0.5 \u03bcg poly(I:C) and 1 \u03bcg pcDNA3-N. Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, USA) was used in transfection assays. Cells transfected only with lipofectamine, only with the pcDNA3.1 vector, and those without any treatment were taken as the lipofectamine control, vector control, and blank control, respectively.\n\nCells were collected at 24 h post transfection with poly(I:C) and pcDNA3-N by 1 min centrifugation at 13 800g, and subsequently homogenized in 500 \u03bcl TRIzol (Tiangen, Beijing, China). Uniq-10 Total RNA Extraction and Purification Kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China) was used to extract total RNA. Before cDNA synthesis, the residual genomic DNA was digested with DNaseI (Promega, USA). The cDNA was synthesized using a Reverse Transcription kit (TOYOBO, Japan). To detect the transcriptional level of different IFNs and transcriptional factors, qPCR was performed in a 20-\u03bcl reaction mixture with SYBR qPCR mix (TOYOBO, Japan) and specific primers (Table 1) using the iCycler iQ5 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad, USA). The transcriptional level of housekeeping gene \u03b2-actin was used to normalize that of the target genes.\n\nCells were harvested 24 h after the secondary transfection. The Dual-Glo luciferase assay (Promega, USA) was used to measure luciferase activity. Briefly, cells were collected by centrifugation at 13 800g for 5 min and homogenized in 100 \u03bcl 1\u00d7passive lysis buffer. Cell lysates (20 \u03bcl) were added to a 96-well fluoroscopy plate. Firefly luciferase activity and Renilla luciferase activity were measured using a luminometer (Thermo, USA) immediately after addition of luciferase assay reagent (LAR) II (Promega, USA) and Stop & Glo reagent (Promega, USA), respectively. The relative luciferase values were measured by the ratio of firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase.\n\nThe cells at 24 h post transfection were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 \u00b0C overnight, and then washed with 1\u00d7phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 15 min and blocked with PBS containing 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h. The samples were labeled with mouse monoclonal anti-PEDV N protein IgG (1:100 (v/v) dilution) and rabbit monoclonal anti-NF-\u03baB IgG (1:100 (v/v) dilution; CST, USA) at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h, and then labeled with the Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:1000 (v/v) dilution, Lifetechnology, USA) and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:1000 (v/v) dilution, Lifetechnology, USA) at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. Cell nuclei were stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Beyotime, China) at 1:1000 (v/v) dilution. Immunofluorescence was visualized using a laser confocal microscope IX81-FV1000 (Olympus, Japan).\n\nCell lysates were prepared in 50 \u03bcl of radio-immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer (Beyotime, China) containing 1 mmol phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (Beyotime, China). Protein concentrations were quantified using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Sangon Biotech, China). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE; 10% (0.1 g/ml)) was used to separate proteins, which were then electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, USA). Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) and 5% nonfat milk was used to block the blots before they were probed with primary antibodies, mouse monoclonal anti-N IgG and rabbit monoclonal anti-NF-\u03baB IgG (CST, USA) at 1:500 (v/v) dilution and rabbit monoclonal anti-\u03b2-actin IgG (Hua\u2019an, China) at 1:2000 (v/v) dilution. Blots were subsequently washed with TBST and incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies, goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled antibody, and goat anti-rabbit HRP-labeled antibody (Sangon Biotech, China). West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo, USA) was used to visualize the Western blotting results. The Gel 3100 chemiluminescent imaging system (Sagecreation, China) was used to capture images.\n\nAll results are presented as mean\u00b1standard error (SE) of triplicate experiments. The data were analyzed using GraphPad-Prism (GraphPad Software, USA). Statistical significances were tested by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).\n\nThe N genes of PEDV were successfully amplified from the CV777 vaccine strain and ten strains isolated between 2013 and 2017 from different farms in Zhejiang Province, China. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on multiple sequence alignment of 11 sequences (Fig. 1). The recent PEDV strains shared N protein amino acid identities of 98.2% to 100.0% (Fig. 1a). The N protein sequence of the CV777 strain formed a monophyletic branch, while those of different recent PEDV strains in China showed a close phylogenetic relationship (Fig. 1b).\n\nExpression of N protein was detected at 24 and 48 h after transfection with pcDNA3-N. Western blots revealed that the N protein began to be expressed in IPEC-J2 cells at 24 h post transfection (Fig. 2). Immunofluorescence validated this result and showed that the N protein was expressed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3a, white box). N protein immunofluorescence could be detected in the transfected cells, suggesting that they could successfully express nucleoprotein (Fig. 3a) unlike those in the pcDNA3.1 vector, lipofectamine, and blank control groups (Figs. 3b and 3c). These results indicated that N protein was successfully expressed in IPEC-J2 cells after transfection.\n\nTo investigate the effect of PEDV N protein on the production of IFN-\u03bb, we used poly(I:C) as an inducer of IFN transcription in IPEC-J2 cells and analyzed the expression of IFNs and their transcription factors. We found that all three types of IFN expression could be significantly induced after poly(I:C) induction, but only IFN-\u03bb3 expression was significantly reduced (P<0.05) after PEDV N protein transfection compared with expression in the pcDNA3.1 vector transfection group (Fig. 4). The IFN transcriptional factor IRF3, but not IRF7, showed a similar downward trend. These results indicated that PEDV N protein might inhibit the induction of IFN-\u03bb3, but not of the other IFNs in IPEC-J2 cells.\n\nTo further confirm IFN-\u03bb3 inhibition by PEDV N protein, we constructed a luciferase reporter vector containing firefly luciferase under the control of the IFN-\u03bb3 promoter. Consistent with the qPCR results, poly(I:C)-induced relative luciferase activity was significantly reduced after PEDV N protein was expressed in IPEC-J2 cells, while it remained induced after the pcDNA3.1 vector was transfected (Fig. 5). These results further indicated IFN-\u03bb3 inhibition by PEDV N protein in IPEC-J2 cells. This inhibition might contribute to virus escape from mucosal immunity in the intestine.\n\nTo further investigate the IFN-\u03bb3 inhibitory mechanism of PEDV N protein, NF-\u03baB, the key cellular transcription factor in the IFN pathway, was examined after PEDV N protein was expressed in poly(I:C)-induced IPEC-J2 cells. Immunofluorescence showed that NF-\u03baB was distributed mostly in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells. After the induction of poly(I:C), it was translocated into the nuclei. However, when PEDV N protein was expressed, the NF-\u03baB distribution returned to the same as that in cells of the vector control group and mock group (Fig. 6). NF-\u03baB distribution was not affected by transfection with the backbone vector pcDNA3.1 (Fig. 6). These results showed that NF-\u03baB failed to translocate into the nuclei, leading to IFN-\u03bb3 inhibition, and suggested that PEDV N protein blocked IFN-\u03bb production by preventing the activation of NF-\u03baB in IPEC-J2 cells.\n\nSecreted IFNs are defined by their ability to combat viral infections. However, many viruses have evolved elaborate mechanisms to modulate IFN signaling or expression using various proteins that may affect different innate immune pathways. Previous studies revealed that the N proteins of coronaviruses exhibit an obvious capacity to inhibit the production of IFN-\u03b2 in vitro (Ye et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2011; Ding et al., 2014). Coronavirus N proteins, which have been reported to be involved in viral RNA replication and transcription, share similar motifs, structural features, and functions (Laude and Masters, 1995; Schelle et al., 2005). In accordance with previous reports, our phylogenetic tree analysis found that the majority of PEDV strains recently isolated in China shared the same N amino acid identity (Fig. 1).\n\nThe recently discovered IFN-\u03bb has been reported to play a critical role in antiviral defense at the mucosal surface (Ank et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2016; Li et al., 2017). Li et al. (2017) found that IFN-\u03bb, expressed on the epithelial cells of the intestine, exhibited strong antiviral activity against PEDV infection in IPEC-J2 cells. To investigate the effect of N protein on IFN-\u03bb, we first increased IFN production in IPEC-J2 cells by the addition of poly(I:C). The three types of IFNs, IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, and IFN-\u03bb3, were notably increased after treatment with poly(I:C) as determined by qPCR. The plasmid of pcDNA3-N was subsequently transfected into IPEC-J2 cells, and the expression of N protein was detected at 24 h by Western blot and immunofluorescences assay (IFA) (Figs. 2 and 3). The mRNA levels of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b3 in poly(I:C)-treated cells were similar to those in poly(I:C) and pcDNA3-N co-transfected cells, whereas the mRNA level of IFN-\u03bb3 was significantly reduced (P<0.05) when the N protein was expressed in IPEC-J2 cells (Fig. 4). A similar trend of the IFN-\u03bb transcription level in poly(I:C) and pcDNA3-N co-transfected cells was shown by the luciferase activity assay (Fig. 5). These data strongly indicated that the N protein of PEDV inhibited the transcription and expression of IFN-\u03bb, but not type I IFNs, in IPEC-J2 cells.\n\nThe type I IFN inhibitory mechanism of PEDV was extensively investigated in previous studies (Guo et al., 2016). However, Ding et al. (2014) found that PEDV N protein significantly inhibited the production of type I IFN in HEK 293 cells. TLR2 mediates PEDV N protein-induced NF-\u03baB activation (Cao et al., 2015), and PEDV N could inhibit double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-induced type I IFN by blocking the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-mediated pathway in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) isolated from the newborn piglet ileum (Cao et al., 2015). One explanation for this disagreement may be the different choice of cells. IPEC-J2 cells are one of the target porcine cell types that PEDV infects. Thus, the data collected from IPEC-J2 cells may reflect a more realistic situation of host-pathogen interaction in vivo. The mRNA level of IRF3 showed a decreasing pattern (Fig. 4). However, due to the low levels of fold change in N-expressing cells, the mRNA level of type I IFNs was not affected by PEDV N protein. Possible explanations for this have been put forward by Zhang et al. (2016) who reported that the IRF3 mRNA level was not the only factor that can affect type I IFNs. It is necessary to determine the protein level and localization of IRF3 to investigate the mechanism of action of type I IFNs. We conducted Western blot and immunofluorescence assays on IRF3 (data not shown), but unfortunately, the commercial antibodies for human IRF3 did not work efficiently on swine cells. Because of these limitations, we focused our experiments only on the inhibitory effect of PEDV N protein on IFN-\u03bb.\n\nRecent studies confirmed that activated IRF3, IRF7, and NF-\u03baB were also required for the production of type III IFN (Thomson et al., 2009; Lazear et al., 2015). Once infected by the virus, NF-\u03baB or IRFs of epithelial cells were activated and then moved into the nuclei and up-regulated the transcription level of IFN-\u03bb (Osterlund et al., 2005; Seth et al., 2005; Odendall et al., 2014; Odendall and Kagan, 2015). Iversen et al. (2010) found that NF-\u03baB had a significant effect on the expression of IFN-\u03bb rather than on type I IFN, suggesting that the NF-\u03baB pathway might play the dominant role in driving the IFN-\u03bb response on epithelial surfaces of the intestine. This might also explain why induction of only type III, not type I or II IFNs, was blocked in our study. However, the swine IFN-\u03bb regulation mechanism remains unknown. In accordance with this evidence, our results indicated that NF-\u03baB moved into the nuclei after the cells were treated with poly(I:C), leading to a significantly increased transcription level of IFN-\u03bb. However, NF-\u03baB failed to move into the nuclei in the PEDV N protein-expressing cells, resulting in a significant decrease in the mRNA level of IFN-\u03bb (Fig. 6). Taken together, our study identified that PEDV N protein caused a blockade of IFN-\u03bb induction through activation of NF-\u03baB in IPEC-J2 cells. The knowledge gained from this study may assist in the development of antiviral reagents and vaccines."}
