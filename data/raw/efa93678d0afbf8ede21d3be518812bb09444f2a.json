{"title": "Viral infections of the respiratory tract in patients with cystic fibrosis", "body": "Respiratory viral infections are frequently responsible for the acute deterioration in the clinical condition of patients with underlying pulmonary disease eg chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma'. They may also predispose to bacterial infections with Haemophilus injuenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae or Staphylococcus awe&. Viral infections of the upper airways are not more frequent in patients with cystic fibrosis than in healthy controls, but the consequences tend to be more serious3. The major cause of acute deterioration of lung function in patients with cystic fibrosis is considered to be f To whom correspondence should be addressed. bacterial, especially P. aeruginosu, and in one-third this is preceded by a viral infection4 '.\n\nNo previous study has compared quantitative bacteriological analyses of the sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis with a study of the immune responses against different viral agents in these patients. We therefore decided to determine to what extent respiratory tract infections with different viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Coxiella hurnetii contribute to the development of the acute bronchopulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis.\n\nSeventy-five patients with laboratory and clinical signs of cystic fibrosis (38 female, 37 male; mean age 15.6 f 5.6, range 428 years) were included in this study. The Shwachman scores' for these patients lay between 35 and 95.\n\nDuring the study period (from November 1984 until April 1987), 275 sera were collected-between one and 18 serum samples from each patient, with a median value of 2. Fifty-two per cent of the serum samples were taken as outpatients at the Dr. von Hauner'sches Kinderspital Miinchen, 22% on admission to hospital and 26% during the hospital stay.\n\nThe majority of the CF-patients (62/75) had a chronic infection (>6 months) with Pseudomonas aeruginosu at the beginning of the study. Five patients harboured P. aeruginosa only intermittently in their airways, whilst six patients were free of the pathogen throughout the study. Two patients with cystic fibrosis developed infection due to P. aeruginosu at the start of the study.\n\nAntibodies against influenza A, influenza B, influenza C viruses, parainfluenzae viruses (types 1,2 and 3), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, M. pneumoniue and C. burnetii were determined by complement fixations. According to Enders9, titers > 1:64 for adenovirus and mycoplasma, > 1:32 for RSV, influenza A and B viruses and C. burnetii, and > 1: 16 for influenza C and parainfluenza viruses, or at least four-fold rises in paired serum samples, are considered to indicate a recent infection.\n\nMicrobiological analyses of sputum'O were performed at the same time as the serology. Sputum sIgA-antibodies against the different lipopolysaccharide antigens of P. aeruginosa were evaluated as described elsewhere\". For statistical calculations the Wilcoxon-Mann-White test, the x2 test and Fisher's exact test were used.\n\nWith the criteria of Enders', previously described, we found 29 viral respiratory infectious episodes in the patients with cystic fibrosis taken into the study. Infections with two different viral agents at the same time occurred twice: influenza A and adenovirus; influenza B and adenovirus. Multiple respiratory tract viral infections were found in seven patients with at least 5 months between the two episodes ( Table 1 ). An at least four-fold titer rise in the complement-fixation test was seen in 25 of the 29 viral infections, and in four cases the first serum samples showed significantly elevated antibody titers (Table 2 ). Influenza A virus was the most frequent serologically proven viral pathogen (11 x ), followed by adenovirus (8 x ), influenza B virus (5 x ), parainfluenza virus serotype 3 (3 x ), parainfluenza virus serotype 1 and RSV (each of 1 x ). We found no serological evidence for infections with influenza ,C virus, parainfluenza virus of the serotype 2, M. pneumoniae or C. burnetii. There was no significant difference between the age distribution of the cystic fibrosis group with and without viral infection of the upper airways (mean age 14.4* 5.4 compared with 16.0 f 5.6). Infections with parainfluenzae viruses seem to appear more frequently in younger children, whereas the prevalence of the other viral agents in the different age groups was similar to the age distribution of all cystic fibrosis patients (Table 3 ). There was no correlation between carriage of P. aeruginosa and viral infection. Viral infections in cystic fibrosis occur during the entire year (Table 4 ). Infections with influenza A and B viruses are most frequent in winter and spring in contrast to parainfluenzae viruses and adenovirus which peak during the summer period.\n\nPatients with cystic fibrosis and viral infections of the upper airways required more frequent hospital admission (P<O.OOl) and stayed there longer (P<O*OOl) than cystic fibrosis patients without proven serological conversion ( Table 5 ). The greatest part of the serologically proven viral infections (21/29) occurred at home (Table 6) and was accompanied by acute exacerbations of respiratory symptoms. Taking into account an incubation period of 1-7 days for the different viral agents and a period of l&20 days for serological conversion, 28% of the viral respiratory diseases may be hospitalacquired. Infections with parainfluenzae viruses and with RSV were seen only outside the hospital, while infections with influenza B virus and adenoviruses tended to occur in hospital. Three of the four adenovirus infections were probably nosocomial. Two of the three infections with influenza B virus in the hospital were seen at the same time in winter during an influenza B epidemic in Munich.\n\nAnalysing the bacterial flora of the sputum in patients with cystic fibrosis we found S. pneumoniue to be as common in CF-patients with respiratory viral infections (l/l 8) as in those without any evidence of infection (5/57). In contrast to S. pneumoniae, H. in&enzae was more frequently detected in the sputum from CF-patients with viral infections of the upper airways (S/ 18 versus 3/57) (P < O-005). Deterioration of the clinical condition with pronounced cough, increased expectoration, loss of weight, reduction of lung function was observed in 78% of the cystic fibrosis patients during their viral infection ( Table 7) .\n\nThe microbial flora of the sputum of the cystic fibrosis patients was unchanged, if the ratio of the number of colony forming units (cfus) per millilitre of the different bacterial or fungal species in the sputum after the viral infection to the number of cfus/per millilitre prior to their onset was smaller than 3.0 or greater than 0.33. At least a three- fold increase of cfus per millilitre of.sputum was found in 25/27 (93%) viral infections, mainly by P. aeruginosa (22/27; 82%) even in those cases without clinical deterioration (Table 7) . In two cases, as well as an increase of the number of cfus per millilitre of P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and H. influenzae appeared in the sputum, whereas in two other patients the only significant change was the detection of H. influenzae or S. aureus. In another case there was colonisation by a penicillin resistant strain of S. aureus. Where either S. aureus or H. infiuenzue was isolated from the sputum during the viral infections, this was most likely just prior to the acute exacerbation.\n\nThe isolation rates of fungi in sputum samples during these acute exacerbations did not parallel the viral infection or the acute exacerbation.\n\nIn 21/27 serologically evident viral diseases there was enough sputum to determine anti-P. aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide antibodies in paired sputum samples. O-Specific sIgA-antibodies showed an increase in 13 of the 21 (62%) viral respiratory tract infections. An increase of sIgA-antibodies in sputum was seen in both double infections in 2/2 infections due to parainfluenza virus serotype 3, in 4/5 (80%) infections with adenovirus, 214 (50%) infections with influenza B virus, and 317 (43%) with influenza A virus.\n\nEvaluation of the serum antibody titers against different viral and bacterial respiratory tract pathogens revealed 29 viral infections in 18 of the 75 patients with cystic fibrosis. This frequency does not completely reflect the real incidence of respiratory tract infections in these patients as not all the required sera were available. Assays were not performed for antibodies against rhinoviruses, coronavirus, echovirus, Chfamydia trachomatis and Legionellapneumophila. The purpose of the study was to show whether there is \"microbial synergism\"'* between the viruses causing respiratory tract infections and the bacterial microflora of the sputa. We found strong evidence for microbial synergism as significant changes (at least three-fold increases of the cfus per millilitre of sputum) of the bacterial sputum flora occurred in 93% and a clinical deterioration in 78% of patients with viral illnesses. These infections may have decreased mucociliary clearance, damaged the respiratory epithelium and suppressed other host defence mechanisms facilitating bacterial adherence and multiplication.\n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa, with its known ability to adhere to damaged epithelial cellsi3, accounted for the greatest part (82%) of the acute bronchopulmonary exacerbations. This was reflected by the increase of sputum sIgA-antibodies directed against the O-antigens of P. aeruginosa at the same time. Even in those cases without apparent deterioration of the clinical condition (22%) the number of cfus of P. aeruginosa per millilitre of sputum increased significantly. There were also cases where S. aureus and/or H. infuenzae were additional pathogens in the sputum without change in the number of cfus of P. aeruginosa. This increase of colonisation with S. aureus or H. influenzae secondary to viral infection agrees with the work by Eichenwald et al. I4 These authors found a correlation between . adenoviral infection of the upper airways in newborn infants and bacterial colonisation of the nasopharynx with S. aureus, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and B-hemolytic streptococci.\n\nIn the treatment of acute respiratory infection in cystic fibrosis, antibiotics effective against S. aureus and H. infruenzae should be considered. Quantitative bacteriological examination of the sputum with the testing of the antibiotic susceptibility of the bacterial isolates is also necessary to optomize antibacterial therapy. In contrast to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, S. pneumoniae was not found. As the detection of S. pneumoniae in a sputum of a patient with cystic fibrosis is rather difficult, even with a selective procedure to inhibit the growth of P. aeruginosa\", serological studies are in progress to determine the prevalence of S. pneumoniae in these acute exacerbations. We found no evidence of significant changes concerning the number of cfus for Can&a albicans or Aspergillus fumigatus in the sputum after viral respiratory illnesses, although C. albicans was the second most frequent microorganism. There were high antibody titers against C. albicans \" The role for respiratory viral or bacterial (mycoplasma, C. P. aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis is still unclear. In one six-year-old girl P. aeruginosa could be detected for the first time from a nasopharyngeal swab after an infection with parainfluenza virus type 1. Another patient intermittently colonized with P. aeruginosa harboured P. aeruginosa in her bronchial system after an infection with influenza A virus. After disappearing from the sputum, P. aeruginosa reappeared after a second influenza A virus infection.\n\nIn contrast to Petersen et ~1.' who emphasised the importance of infections due to RSV we found the highest incidence to be influenza A virus followed by adenovirus. This predominant role of influenza A virus may be associated with a higher level of respiratory-tract proteases in cystic fibrosis, incuding proteolytic cleavage of influenza virus hemagglutinin which is required for the penetration of the virus into the epithelial cell\". The low rate of significantly increasing O-specific sIgA-antibodies after infections with influenza A virus in contrast to the other viral agents might be related to a suppression of the humoral immune system by this virus\".\n\nTaking the incubation period and the time required for seroconversion into account, about one-third of the serologically evident viral infections seemed to be nosocomial infections. As we have not determined serotype-specific antibodies against adenovirus we could not prove whether the three infections caused by adenovirus were due to cross infection. Donati et ~1.'~ demonstrated that home therapy for cystic fibrosis patients with pulmonary exacerbations is as effective as hospital therapy. The possibility that patients with cystic fibrosis acquire viral respiratory illnesses in hospital emphasises the importance of home therapy.\n\nThe results of this study show clearly the importance of viral respiratory tract infections in cystic fibrosis. All cystic fibrosis patients should be vaccinated against influenza. Chemoprophylaxis with amantadine'* or treatment with ribavirin\" should be considered. Future developments should include the diagnosis of respiratory viral illnesses as well as the production of vaccines against adenovirus, parainfluenza virus and RSV*O. Studies are in progress to elucidate the role of viral or other bacterial infections for the establishment of primary colonisation with P. aeruginosa in the bronchial system of patients with cystic fibrosis."}
