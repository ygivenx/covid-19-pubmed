{"title": "Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Hainan, China", "body": "In December 2019, patients with pneumonia of unknown causes were found in some medical institutions in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. 1 On January 7, 2020, the virus was isolated from a sample of a positive patient and the entire genome sequence of the virus was obtained. 2 Subsequent studies indicated that the virus belonged to the type b coronavirus family, and its genetic characteristics were obviously different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). 3, 4 The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the new coronavirus pneumonia as a public health emergency of international concern on 31 January 2020, and officially named it \"coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19)\"on February 11, 2020 . Covid-19 is mainly transmitted from human-to-human by respiratory droplets and close contact, and may also be transmitted through fecal mouth and aerosol. 5, 6 The clinical manifestations of Covid-19 are very similar to SARS, and patients may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is highly likely to require intensive care and even lead to death. 7 Since January 2020, the Covid-19 has spread rapidly from Wuhan to other parts of China and other countries around the world. [8] [9] [10] As of March 13, 2020, a total of 132,758 laboratory-confirmed cases (80,991 in China) and 4955 deaths (3180 in China) had been reported worldwide. 11 With the increasing number of confirmed and suspected cases globally, the situation of disease prevention and control is extremely critical.\n\nSince the outbreak of Covid- 19 , several studies have successively reported the clinical characteristics of patients infected with Covid-19, but almost all the research All rights reserved.

[12] [13] [14] [15] Hainan province is an independent island located at the southern tip of China, unlike the rest of China, Hainan province belongs to tropical monsoon climate. Previous studies have found that climate affects the spread of SARS virus. 16 Therefore, we describe the clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of patients infected with Covid-19 in Hainan province to explore whether it is different from other regions in China, and to provide an insight into the prevention and treatment of Covid-19 across China, especially to other places with similar climate and environment as Hainan province.\n\nWe conducted a retrospective study focusing on the clinical characteristics of Commission of the People's Republic of China. 18 A confirmed case was defined as a positive result to high-throughput sequencing or real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay for nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. 7 Only the laboratory-confirmed cases were included in the analysis.\n\nThe study was approved by the institutional ethics board of the Second Affiliated All rights reserved.

Written informed consent was waived due to the urgent need to collect clinical data on this emerging disease.\n\nAll medical records of patients were extracted by a doctor assigned by local hospital and sent to the data processing center in Haikou. A team of experienced respiratory clinicians reviewed and abstracted the data. Data were entered into a computerized database and cross-checked. If the data were with mission or doubt, the coordinators in Haikou contacted the doctor who is responsible for the treatment of the patient for clarification.\n\nThe epidemiological characteristics (demographic data, exposure history, and underlying comorbidities), clinical (symptoms and signs), laboratory (ie, complete blood count, blood chemistry, coagulation test, liver and renal function, electrolytes) and radiological findings (chest X-ray or computed tomography), treatment (ie, antiviral therapy, corticosteroid therapy, respiratory support) and outcomes (remained in hospital, discharges, death) data were extracted from electronic medical records.\n\nThe severity of Covid-2019 was defined based on the \"Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (trial version 7)\" published by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. 19 Severe patients are defined as having been critically ill during their hospitalization. Fever was defined as an axillary temperature of 37.3\u00b0C or higher.

Consistent with previous findings, 15, 23 we found that the older and patients with comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes and CVD) were more likely to develop severe illness. All death in patients (5 imported cases and 1 local case) have a kind of comorbidity, 2 of them have two comorbidities. The possible reason may be the chronic course of hypertension and diabetes leading consistent damage to the micro-vascular walls, resulting in both inefficacy of immune cell infiltration and drug deliver into lung areas. 24,25 In our study, 8 patients were young patients aged 0 to 17 years, the youngest was 3 months and 19 days, and the oldest was 17 years old.\n\nThe 8 adolescent patients were all relatively mild without significant changes in radiology and laboratory test, moreover, none of them progressed to critical ill case, similar results have also reported in another study conducted in Guangzhou. 26 The mechanism responsible for this phenomenon is not clear yet and further research is needed to explore the possible causes.\n\nIn consistence with previous studies, fever, dry cough and expectoration were All rights reserved.

Interestingly, the decrease of eosinophils is pronounced in severe patients in our study, and eosinophil counts are even lower in some critically ill patients.

At present, the cause of the returning positive of RT-PCR still remains unclear, though there were no evidence shows that kind of patients have the infectivity, we still suggest the current standards for hospital discharge should be reevaluated, and the detection and management of discharged patients should be strengthened.\n\nOur study has some limitations. First, though we have included all the patients of Covid-19 in Hainan province, the sample size was still relatively small and the patients were only from Hainan province, it might be that more clinical features related to Covid-19 would not be identified yet. Secondly, some cases had incomplete record of the radiologic and laboratory testing, given the different procedures among different hospitals.\n\nIn conclusion, patients infected with Covid-19 have a severe rate of 21.4% and a fatality rate of 3.6% in Hainan province. The elderly people with diabetes, hypertension and CVD are more likely to develop severe cases. Fever is the most common symptom, though it does not occur in all patients before hospital admission.\n\nIn light of the rapid spread of Covid-19 around the world, and no specialized medication to treat Covid-19, early identification and diagnosis is important for the prevention and treatment of Covid-19 to prevent patients from developing into critical illness.\n\nAll rights reserved.
