{"title": "Catalytic sterilization of Escherichia coli K 12 on Ag/Al 2 O 3 surface on pure culture of Escherichia coli K 12 was studied", "body": "Sterilization is an important procedure to maintain a sanitary environment. For this purpose, many chemical germicides have been used. With these applications, the potential dangers of the compounds to human health and environment are concerned. TiO 2 photocatalysts applied in water disinfection process were noticeable, which provided an alternative to conventional chemical germicides [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . However, this technology requires a relatively complex device and photo energy. Recently, we have reported the inactivation efficiency of Ag/Al 2 O 3 and Cu/Al 2 O 3 to SARS coronavirus, bacteria and yeast [6] . The microbes are completely inactivated in 5 min on Ag/Al 2 O 3 surface at room temperature in air, and we suggest a catalytic oxidation mechanism in this disinfection process.\n\nEven though the bactericidal effect of compounds containing silver has been investigated for a long time, its mechanism is still controversial. Some reports insisted that the antibacterial activity of silver-loaded compounds is depended on the cytotoxicity of Ag + eluted from the compounds into system containing the microorganisms [7, 8] . At the same time, it has been suggested that the reactive oxygen species play an important role in the expression of the bactericidal activity in water [9, 10] .\n\nTo identify the inactivation mechanism of bactericidal process on the surface of Ag/Al 2 O 3 in air, e.g. by catalytic oxidation or by toxicity of heavy metals, Ag/Al 2 O 3 and AgCl/Al 2 O 3 were used in this study since they have different amount of Ag + which may be eluted from the catalysts. In this study, we also report that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in the expression of the bactericidal activity on the surface of catalysts. \n\nAg/Al 2 O 3 and AgCl/Al 2 O 3 (Ag 5 wt%) were prepared by impregnation and precipitation methods respectively. After Al 2 O 3 powder was introduced into an appropriate amount of silver nitrate aqueous solution, the mixture was stirred at room temperature. As for AgCl/Al 2 O 3 , an appropriate amount of ammonium chloride aqueous solution was added into the mixture at a rate of 0.5 ml/min, while the Ag/Al 2 O 3 need not this step. Both of the wet samples were dried at 120\u00b0C for 12 h, and then calcined in air at 600\u00b0C for 3 h [11] . Before using, Al 2 O 3 , Ag/Al 2 O 3 and AgCl/Al 2 O 3 powders were pressed into wafers of ca. 20 mg/cm 2 . XRD is used to investigate the silver phase on c-Al 2 O 3 . In the case of Ag/Al 2 O 3 , only the c-Al 2 O 3 phase was detected when the silver loading was 5 wt%, and the absence of diffraction lines of silver phase on 5 wt% Ag/Al 2 O 3 catalyst indicates that silver is at a very high dispersion degree. To 5 wt% AgCl/Al 2 O 3 , however, the peaks attributable to AgCl phase was observed at 2h of 27.76\u00b0, 32.24\u00b0, 55.86\u00b0, 57.34\u00b0and 76.54\u00b0(PDF-ICDD 85-1355, PDF-ICDD 31-1238). The absence of diffraction lines of silver phase on 5 wt% Ag/Al 2 O 3 catalyst indicates that silver is at a very high dispersion degree. TEM was also used to investigate the silver phase on c-Al 2 O 3 . As for 5 wt% Ag/Al 2 O 3 , the silver particle (ranging from 15 to 20 nm) at a very high dispersion degree was observed. In the case of 5 wt% AgCl/Al 2 O 3 , the silver particle was greater than that of 5 wt% Ag/Al 2 O 3 (ranging from 20 to 50 nm).\n\nCulture of micro-organisms E. coli K 12 strain ATCC23716 was inoculated into LB broth (Fluka Co. 61748) and grew aerobically for 24 h at 37\u00b0C with constant agitation. Aliquots of the culture were inoculated into fresh medium and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 4-5 h until reaching an exponential growth phase. Bacterial cells were collected using centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and the bacterial pellet was washed with sterile water. Finally, bacterial cells were suspended in the water then diluted to the required cell density corresponding to 10 8 colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml).\n\nA 20 ll aliquot of the E. coli suspension was applied onto the wafer surface of catalyst, and the contacting times (refers to the bacteria contacting time with the wafers of catalyst before sampling) were for 0.5, 2, 5, 10 and 20 min at room temperature. The survival cells were washed off from the catalyst wafers with sterile water. 0.5 ml eluate was immediately injected into 4.5 ml 0.9% NaCl aqueous solution to eliminate the effect of Ag + [12] , and then plated on LB agar (Fluka Co.61746) plates. The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h before counting. All experiments were repeated three times. The wafers of catalysts were investigated using SEM during the bactericidal process. Before SEM measurement, the E. coli on the wafers were fixed with glutaraldehyde and osmium tetroxide, drained with ethanol/water with the concentrations of ethanol increasing. The absolute ethanol was replaced by dimethoxymethane, and the samples underwent critical point drying with CO 2 . The wafers were glued onto stages with conductive silver and metallized with gold. The samples were microscoped and photographed with a scanning electron microscope (Fei QUANTA 200).\n\nThe bactericidal activity was measured under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions, which was achieved by oxygen or nitrogen bubbling to investigate the effect of dissolved oxygen. Superoxide dismutase (SOD, Sigma) was used to investigate the effect of ROS on bactericidal activity. Fifty unit per ml and 100 unit/ml of SOD solution was made, respectively. The solution was added to the E. coli K12 suspension and mixed sufficiently. A 20 ll of the mixture of E. coli suspension and SOD solution was applied onto the wafer surface of catalyst, and the sampling times were for 0.5, 2, 5, 10 and 20 min at room temperature.\n\nIn situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) method was used to investigate the dynamic changes of IR spectra on Ag/Al 2 O 3 surface during the bactericidal process, and DRIFTS spectra were recorded on a Nexus 670 (Thermo Nicolet) FT-IR, equipped with an in situ diffuse reflection chamber and a high sensitivity MCT detector. After E. coli suspension and catalyst powder were mixed completely, the mixed sample was placed in a ceramic crucible in the in situ chamber. Total carbon (TC) content of mixture of E. coli and catalysts is determined using Apollo 9000 Analyzer (Terkmar Dohmann) during the bactericidal process. It was observed that TC decreased during the catalytic oxidation process, which implied that TC of E. coli had converted to CO 2 and released from the catalysts. The formation of CO 2 during this process can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nwhere TC 0 signifies initial TC and TC i is TC at different times during this process.\n\nThe bactericidal activity of Al 2 O 3 , Ag/Al 2 O 3 and AgCl/ Al 2 O 3 in air was investigated. Fig. 1 shows the time course changes with the viable cell count of E. coli. The process where Al 2 O 3 used as host compounds (Fig. 1a) shows that the cell concentration decreased from 2.8 \u00b7 10 8 CFU/ml to 1 \u00b7 10 6 CFU/ml within 20 min after addition. Obviously, the processes with Ag/Al 2 O 3 (Fig. 1b) and AgCl/Al 2 O 3 (Fig. 1c) show a higher bactericidal effect on E. coli than Al 2 O 3 . The bacteria lost their colony forming ability in 0.5 min after applied onto the wafer of Ag/Al 2 O 3 and AgCl/Al 2 O 3. The spoiling of bacteria was also observed by SEM photographs as shown in Fig. 2 . Fig. 2a and b show the SEM images of E. coli adhered on Al 2 O 3 at room temperature for 0.5 min and 24 h, respectively. Although some cells were damaged after E. coli exposured to the wafer of Al 2 O 3 for 0.5 min, the viable cells were still detectable using plate counting method. Some cells collapsed and led to release of intracellular constituents, however, their membrane and intracellular constituents covered the surface even after 24 h. Fig. 2c -e and f-h show the SEM images of E. coli adhered on AgCl/Al 2 O 3 and Ag/ Al 2 O 3 at room temperature for 0.5 min, 0.5 and 1 h, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1 , it is obvious that Ag/Al 2 O 3 and AgCl/Al 2 O 3 gave a higher bactericidal effect on E. coli than Al 2 O 3 . Although AgCl/Al 2 O 3 exhibited a similar bactericidal ability comparing with Ag/Al 2 O 3 , the SEM images indicate that different mechanisms are involved in the bactericidal action of AgCl/Al 2 O 3 and Ag/Al 2 O 3 . The cell membrane damage mainly started at one end of E. coli on the surface of AgCl/Al 2 O 3 (Fig. 2c) , and intracellular constituents were released from the damaged site. After exposure time of 0.5 h, the cell was further spoiled (Fig. 2d) . After 1 h, the clean catalyst surface reappeared (Fig. 2e) . The damage of bacteria on the surface of Ag/Al 2 O 3 was more serious than that of AgCl/Al 2 O 3 (Fig. 2f-h) . Even though after 30 s on AgCl/Al 2 O 3 , a great deal of intracellular constituents spouted from damaged sites on the cell membrane (Fig. 2f) . After exposure time of 0.5 h, E. coli cells shrank and the catalyst surface covered by the cells reappeared (Fig. 2g, h) .\n\nAs mentioned above, the bactericidal mechanism of Ag containing compounds is still controversial [8] [9] [10] [11] . During the process of the E. coli suspension contacted with Ag/ Al 2 O 3 and AgCl/Al 2 O 3 , Ag + released unavoidablely. In order to confirm the bactericidal effect of Ag + , the catalyst wafers were dip in sterile water for 10 min and the quantitative analysis of Ag + in the eluate was carried out with an atomic adsorption spectrophotometer. The bactericidal effect of a series of AgNO 3 (10 \u00c09 , 10 \u00c08 , 10 \u00c05 , 10 \u00c04 , 10 \u00c03 M) contacting with E. coli suspension for 10 min were determined. The correlation between the concentration of Ag + and the quantity of survival cells was reflected in a curve, so the effect of Ag + released from the catalyst can be confirmed. As shown in Fig. 3 , the colony-forming ability of E. coli lost in Ag + containing solution when the concentration of Ag + is more than 10 \u00c04 M. The concentrations of Ag + eluted from Ag/Al 2 O 3 and AgCl/Al 2 O 3 were less than 2.9 \u00b7 10 \u00c04 M and 4.7 \u00b7 10 \u00c07 M under such experimental conditions, respectively. According to this result, Ag + was released from the catalysts, and the bactericidal ability of the Ag/Al 2 O 3 would be related to the amount of Ag + dissolved in a certain extent. However the amount of Ag + eluted from AgCl/Al 2 O 3 is too little to cause any bactericidal effect against E. coli.\n\nThe effect of oxygen and nitrogen gas bubbling on the bactericidal activity was also investigated. This investigation was performed to obtain information about the role of oxygen in the bactericidal activity of Ag/Al 2 O 3 and AgCl/Al 2 O 3 . 0.5 g Al 2 O 3 , Ag/Al 2 O 3 and AgCl/Al 2 O 3 powder was added into 40 ml sterilized water respectively, and then the aerobic and anaerobic condition was achieved by oxygen and nitrogen gas bubbling for 40 min before piping the bacteria into the system. The bubbling was continued throughout the treatment period. The bactericidal activity of Al 2 O 3 under the same condition was studied as the control experiment. The results are shown in Fig. 4 . Under the anaerobic condition, the bactericidal activity of Ag/Al 2 O 3 sharply decreased compared to that in the aerobic condition. Though the bactericidal activity of AgCl/Al 2 O 3 was lower than Ag/Al 2 O 3 , it can also be obviously observed that the bactericidal activity in aerobic condition is better than that in anaerobic condition. These results suggest that nitrogen gas bubbling drastically suppresses the bactericidal activity of Ag/Al 2 O 3 , and indicate that the presence of oxygen is necessary for the bactericidal activity by Ag/ Al 2 O 3 and AgCl/Al 2 O 3 .\n\nFrom above experimental results, we consider that oxygen can be activated to ROS by the catalyst, which play an important role in the bactericidal activity. The ROS might contain superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals. SOD is a scavenger for superoxide anions and hydroxyl radicals. The effect of addition of SOD on the bactericidal activity was investigated (Fig. 5) . Compared with the situation without SOD, in the presence of SOD, the bacterial survival apparently increased on the surface of Ag/Al 2 O 3 and AgCl/Al 2 O 3 , respectively. The addition of 100 unit/ml SOD drastically suppressed the bactericidal activity. The survival bacterial was kept more than 1 \u00b7 10 6 CFU/ml when 100 unit/ml of SOD added (The survival bacteria were less than 5 \u00b7 10 5 CFU/ml when 50 unit/ml of SOD added). This result indicates that the formation of superoxide anions and hydroxyl radicals contributes to the bactericidal activity.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 6 , Ag/Al 2 O 3 added with E. coli was investigated using DRIFTS during exposure of the sample to O 2 for 42 h at 44\u00b0C. After exposure of the sample to pure O 2 for 18 h, peaks at 2339 and 2362 cm \u00c01 assigned to gas phase CO 2 were observed, and the intensity of CO 2 peaks increased with time increasing. The appearance of gas phase CO 2 strongly supports that the bactericidal process on Ag/Al 2 O 3 not only leads to the cell death, but also causes the completely catalytic oxidation of bacteria and other intermediates.\n\nFurthermore, the formation of CO 2 was investigated by TC analysis as shown in Fig. 7 . About 49% and 28% of TC of E. coli were converted to CO 2 in air at 44\u00b0C after the E. coli cells were added to the surfaces of Ag/Al 2 O 3 and AgCl/Al 2 O 3 for 125 h, respectively.\n\nIt should be noticed that the time of surface reappearance is different from the time producing CO 2 . In the SEM images, we can only see the surface uncovered with bacteria reappeared, but the surface might not as clean as the fresh surface, where small molecules might adsorb. The small molecules might have not been oxygenated completely into CO 2 , but they already could not be seen using SEM. In addition, the catalyst could adsorb a mass of CO 2 , \n\n(1)\n\n(2) because of its large specific surface area. Therefore the detection of CO 2 desorbed from the catalyst will be delayed.\n\nAg/Al 2 O 3 and AgCl/Al 2 O 3 demonstrated a stronger bactericidal activity than Al 2 O 3 . The colony-forming abil-ity of E. coli was completely lost in 0.5 min on both of Ag/Al 2 O 3 and AgCl/Al 2 O 3 at room temperature in air. Relying on SEM investigation, the different bactericidal mechanisms were identified on the surfaces of Ag/Al 2 O 3 and AgCl/Al 2 O 3 . The role of Ag + eluted from AgCl/ Al 2 O 3 can be ignored in our experiments. Oxygen, which can be activated to ROS by catalyst, is essential for the expression of bactericidal activity. The strong catalytic oxidation ability was expressed on the Ag/Al 2 O 3 surface, and CO 2 as the ultimate product was observed during the bactericidal process. All of these results indicate that the catalytic oxidation is the essential mechanism in bactericidal process. Further work is needed to clarify the details of these actions.\n\nreactive oxygen species SEM scanning electron microscopy SARS severe acute respiratory syndrome XRD X-ray polycrystalline diffraction TEM transmission electron microscopy CFU/ml colony forming units per milliliter SOD superoxide dismutase DRIFTS diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy TC total carbon"}
