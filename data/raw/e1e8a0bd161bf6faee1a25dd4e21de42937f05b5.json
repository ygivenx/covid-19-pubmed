{"title": "Maturation of Lymph Node Fibroblastic Reticular Cells from Myofibroblastic Precursors Is Critical for Antiviral Immunity", "body": "Lymph nodes (LNs) and other secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) provide particular microenvironments for optimal induction and control of immune responses (Junt et al., 2008; Mueller and Germain, 2009 ). These specialized niches are generated and maintained by different sets of vascular and mesenchymal stromal cells (Randall et al., 2008; Turley et al., 2010) . The mesenchymal stromal cell network of the LN T cell zone is formed by fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) which are characterized by the expression of podoplanin (PDPN), and extracellular matrix proteins such as ERTR-7 and collagen-I (Malhotra et al., 2012) . Furthermore, FRCs regulate immune homeostasis and reactivity through the production of homeostatic chemokines, the immune-regulatory cytokine interleukin-7 (IL-7) (Link et al., 2007) , and small molecules such as nitric oxide (Lukacs-Kornek et al., 2011; Siegert et al., 2011) . However, although LN FRCs are phenotypically well-characterized (Katakai et al., 2004; Malhotra et al., 2012) , their development from mesenchymal precursors has remained elusive.\n\nThe differentiation of FRCs from their progenitor(s) is thought to be closely linked to lymphoid organogenesis. The early steps of both LN and Peyer's patch (PP) organogenesis involve the appearance of hematopoietic lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells in the respective anlagen (Mebius et al., 1997; Yoshida et al., 1999) . Lymphotoxin-b receptor (LTbR) and receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL)-mediated interaction of LTi cells with mesenchymal stromal cells in the LN or PP anlage is thought to be critical for their further development (van de Pavert and Mebius, 2010; Randall et al., 2008) . Indeed, mice lacking LTi cells fail to generate both LNs and PPs (Eberl et al., 2004; Boos et al., 2007) and molecules of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family expressed by LTi cells provide essential signals for the developing SLOs (De Togni et al., 1994; Koni et al., 1997; Kong et al., 1999) . LTbR engagement on stromal cells appears to be particularly important because the expression of IL-7, C-C motif chemokine 19 (CCL19), and CCL21 generates a positive feedback loop that attracts and activates further LTi cells (Honda et al., 2001; Ohl et al., 2003) . Mesenchymal stromal cells interacting with LTi cells during prenatal stages of SLO development are commonly referred to as lymphoid tissue organizer (LTo) cells and have been described as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1)and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1)-expressing cells that appear around embryonic day (E) 16 in the murine LN anlage (Cupedo et al., 2004c; White et al., 2007) . Gene-expression analysis revealed that these cells provide molecules involved in LN organogenesis including LTbR, RANKL, CCL19, CCL21, CXCL13, and IL-7 (Cupedo et al., 2004c; B\u00e9 n\u00e9 zech et al., 2010) . However, neither global gene ablation of LTbRligands (De Togni et al., 1994; Koni et al., 1997) or the LTbR itself (F\u00fc tterer et al., 1998) , nor LTbR expression on mesenchymal stromal cells of the LN anlage (Cupedo et al., 2004c; White et al., 2007; B\u00e9 n\u00e9 zech et al., 2010) has allowed for the determination of the developmental window of LTbR-dependent mesenchymal LTo cell stimulation that is critical for LN or PP development.\n\nDeletion of genes in a cell-specific and spatiotemporally controlled manner can be achieved by utilizing the Cre-loxP system. Here, we report the generation of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-transgenic mouse model that utilizes the Ccl19 promoter to target the Cre recombinase specifically to mesenchymal stromal cells of the developing LN and to FRCs and FRC-like cells in adult LNs and PPs, respectively. Surprisingly, ablation of the LTbR on Ccl19-cre + mesenchymal stromal cells did not abrogate LN development. Moreover, although the maturation of LN FRCs from myofibroblastic precursors was blocked in Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl mice, the basic infrastructure of the adult LN with T and B cell zone segregation and a functional conduit system was established. However, Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl mice were immunodeficient because myofibroblastic FRC precursors were devoid of essential immune-stimulatory properties such as production of homeostatic chemokines and IL-7. Moreover, conditionally FRC-deficient animals showed an impaired resistance to viral infection, indicating that LTbRmediated FRC maturation is critical for the maintenance of immunocompentence.\n\nCurrently, LN FRCs are defined as PDPN + CD31 \u00c0 stromal cells in the T cell zone and interfollicular regions expressing smooth muscle actin (SMA) and the extracellular matrix protein ERTR7 (Link et al., 2007; Malhotra et al., 2012) . However, neither of these markers is truly FRC-specific. For example, PDPN is expressed on different stromal cell populations (Malhotra et al., 2012) and hence Pdpn-cre transgenes target both PDPN + CD31 \u00c0 FRCs and PDPN + CD31 + lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) (Onder et al., 2011) . Here, we utilized the Ccl19 promoter to direct Cre recombinase expression to LN FRCs. To silence the Ccl21 gene, which is in close proximity to the Ccl19 locus, the murine Ccl21 gene was replaced by the human CD8 gene in the BAC construct. Crossing of transgenic lines with R26-eyfp reporter mice (Srinivas et al., 2001) facilitated screening for founders with exclusive transgene expression in nonhematopoietic cells ( Figure 1A ; see also Figures S1A and S1B available online). Because two out of seven founder lines showed identical stromal cell-specific transgene expression, all further analyses were performed with founder line 1 designated as Ccl19-cre. Staining of CD45 \u00c0 LN cells with antibodies against PDPN and CD31 revealed a normal LN stromal cell composition in Ccl19-cre 3 R26-eyfp mice ( Figure 1B) . Importantly, FRC specificity was high with 80%-90% of the EYFP signal being directed to the PDPN + CD31 \u00c0 fraction ( Figures 1C and 1D ). In situ analysis using Figure S1 .\n\nLymphotoxin-b Receptor-Dependent FRC Maturation confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that Ccl19-cre + cells were found mainly in the T cell zone and in interfollicular regions of the LN ( Figure 1E ). Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of high-resolution microscopic analyses showed that the transgene was expressed uniformly in the PDPN + ERTR7 + reticular T cell zone network ( Figure 1F ). Furthermore, FRCs ensheathing CD31 + high endothelial venules (HEVs) were transgene-positive ( Figure 1G ). Ccl19-cre + LN FRCs expressed CCL21 ( Figure 1H , arrows) and CCL19 ( Figure 1I , arrows) indicating that the Ccl19-cre transgene targets both past and present CCL19 expression in these nonhematopoietic cells.\n\nStromal cell composition in spleen is different from LNs because the double-negative (DN, PDPN \u00c0 CD31 \u00c0 ) fraction is dominant and PDPN + CD31 + LECs are not present in this organ (Onder et al., 2011) . Ccl19-cre transgene activity was highest in the DN cell population (Figures S1C and S1D) with EYFP + cells being dispersed in all compartments of the white pulp (Figure S1E) . High densities of transgene-positive cells could be detected in the area of the marginal zone ( Figure S1F ) and around central arterioles ( Figure S1G ). In contrast, transgene activity in PP stromal cells was high in PDPN + CD31 \u00c0 cells and moderate in DN cells with around 80% and 20% of all EYFP + cells, respectively (Figures S1H and S1I). Because PDPN + CD31 \u00c0 cells in PPs are still undefined, we have referred to them as FRC-like cells. Transgene-positive cells were rare in subdomal areas and more dense in the abluminal part of the PP ( Figure S1J ), but associated both with T cell-and B cellrich areas ( Figure S1K ), suggesting that PP FRC-like cells are involved in the orchestration of both T and B cell responses. Taken together, the Ccl19-cre transgene permits in vivo targeting of LN FRCs and FRC-like cells of PPs.\n\nCcl19-Cre + Mesenchymal Stromal Cells To assess Ccl19-Cre transgene activity during early LN development, we determined reporter gene expression in inguinal LN anlagen of Ccl19-cre 3 R26-eyfp on E16.5 and E18.5. We found that Ccl19-cre + stromal cells were highly abundant in the E16.5 inguinal LN anlage (Figures 2A; Figure S2A ). Furthermore, the E16.5 inguinal LN anlage had attracted CD4 + LTi cells, which most likely deliver the necessary LTa 1 b 2 for stimulation of the LTbR on mesenchymal stromal organizer cells. The number of Ccl19-cre + stromal cells grew approximately 3-fold until E18.5, whereas the CD4 + LTi cell population expanded only modestly ( Figure 2B ; Figure S2B ). To assess whether Cre-recombinase expression reflected the kinetics of Ccl19 expression in developing LNs, we determined both Crerecombinase and Ccl19 mRNA production in neonatal and week 2 and six LN homogenates by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Endogenous Ccl19 expression ( Figure 2C ) correlated well with Cre expression ( Figure 2D ) driven by the Ccl19 promoter on the BAC transgene. In contrast, Ltbr expression fluctuated with the highest expression being measureable in the neonatal LN ( Figure 2E ). Confocal microscopic analysis revealed that Ccl19-cre transgene expression was highly abundant in neonatal inguinal LNs ( Figure 2F , left panels). 3D reconstruction of high-resolution analyses indicated that Ccl19-cre-expressing stromal cells in the developing LN had formed a dense network ( Figure 2F , right panels) reminiscent of the FRC network in the adult LN. Whereas Ccl19-cre + stromal cells expressed low amounts of PDPN, the mesenchymal markers smooth muscle actin (SMA) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-b (PDGFRb) were highly expressed (Figure 2G) , indicating that the Ccl19-cre transgene targets mesenchymal stromal cells in developing LNs.\n\nThe differentiation of adult stromal cell subpopulations is thought to depend on LTbR signaling (Randall et al., 2008; van de Pavert and Mebius, 2010) . Because lymphocytes are rare in neonatal LNs and LTbR-dependent stimulation of mesenchymal stromal cells is mainly provided by LTi cells (Cupedo et al., 2004b; White et al., 2007) , it is most likely that Ccl19-cre + mesenchymal stromal cell in neonatal LNs received LTbR signals from LTi cells. Interestingly, deletion of the LTbR on Ccl19-cre + mesenchymal stromal cells did not abrogate LN formation (Figure 2H) . Furthermore, formation of a stromal cell network in neonatal LNs was not affected by mesenchymal stromal cellspecific LTbR-ablation ( Figure 2H , right panels). Likewise, expression of SMA and PDGFRb ( Figure 2I ) was not altered by the selective LTbR-ablation. Gross pathological examination of adult Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl mice (4-6 weeks) after injection of Evan's Blue revealed that all LNs were present (data not shown). In contrast, Ccl19-cre-dependent ablation of the LTbR in PPs led to significantly reduced PP numbers ( Figure S2C ). Taken together, these data indicate that Ccl19-cre expression in PP mesenchymal stromal cells occurs in a developmental window of critical LTbR-sensitivity. Conversely, Ccl19-cre-expressing mesenchymal stromal cells in developing LNs do not require LTbR signals to facilitate LN formation.\n\nTo assess the impact of Ccl19-cre-mediated LTbR-ablation on global LN structure and organization, we utilized recently developed optical projection tomography (OPT) routines (Kumar et al., 2010) . The mesoscopic imaging analysis revealed that LNs of Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl mice had developed clearly distinguishable B cell follicles and a HEV network ( Figure 3A ). Quantification of the 3D data showed that conditionally LTbR-deficient LNs were approximately 25%-30% smaller than control LNs (Figure 3B) and exhibited a comparable reduction in B cell follicle size ( Figure 3C ), HEV length ( Figure 3D ), and complexity of the HEV network ( Figure 3E ). The OPT-based finding that LNs with FRC-specific LTbR-deficiency were still able to establish the basic LN infrastructure was supported by confocal microscopy, which showed that LNs had generated clearly distinguishable T and B cell zones ( Figure 3F ). The global reduction of LN size without specific impairment of substructures was reflected by the comparable reduction of various hematopoietic cell populations ( Figure 3G ). Thus, FRC-specific ablation of LTbR-signaling did not affect the formation of the basic LN structure with clear T and B cell zone segregation.\n\nTo assess whether the conditional LTbR-deficiency affects LN stromal cell composition, we prepared single-cell suspensions from Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl and control Ltbr +/+ LNs, depleted CD45 + hematopoietic cells and stained the enriched stromal cells with antibodies against PDPN and CD31. Flow cytometric analysis revealed a loss of PDPN + CD31 \u00c0 cells that coincided with a significant increase of PDPN \u00c0 CD31 \u00c0 cells ( Figure 4A ). Importantly, the remaining PDPN + CD31 \u00c0 cells had lost LTbR expression ( Figures 4B and 4C ). Confocal microscopic analysis confirmed the substantial reduction of PDPN expression in Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl LNs ( Figure 4D ). However, ERTR7 protein production and the formation of the fibroblastic reticular network was not affected by FRC-specific LTbR ablation ( Figure 4D ). Moreover, the fibroblastic network still generated ERTR7-ensheathed collagen bundles ( Figure 4E ), i.e., the conduit system, which rapidly drained small molecules through the T cell zone, both in the presence and absence of LTbR on T cell zone reticular cells ( Figure 4F ). T cell zone reticular cells both in the LN parenchyma and surrounding HEVs had lost CCL21 positivity in Ccl19- cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl LNs, whereas vascular endothelial cells in HEVs still produced this chemokine ( Figure 4G ). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of whole LN homogenates confirmed the substantial loss of Ccl21 mRNA expression in conditionally LTbR-deficient LNs ( Figure 4H ). Moreover, Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl LNs produced significantly less Ccl19 ( Figure 4I ) and Il7 ( Figure 4J ) mRNA but almost normal amounts of the B cell zone chemokine Cxcl13 ( Figure 4K ). Taken together, these data show that Ccl19 promoter-dependent LTbR-ablation profoundly altered the LN stromal cell composition and abolished expression of molecules in T cell zone reticular cells, which are considered part of the molecular signature of FRCs.\n\nThe pronounced reduction of PDPN + FRCs and the concomitant increase in DN stromal cells in LNs Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl suggested that DN LN stromal cells may differentiate into FRCs.\n\nIndeed, in vitro culture of sorted DN cells from Ccl19-cre 3 R26eyfp LNs in the presence of LTi cells resulted in activation of the Ccl19 promoter ( Figures S3A-S3C) . Moreover, upregulation of EYFP was accompanied by a pronounced increase in PDPN expression ( Figure S3D ). Crossing of Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl mice with R26-eyfp reporter mice confirmed that genetically labeled (i.e., EYFP + ) FRCs emerge from DN precursors in a LTbR gene dose-dependent fashion ( Figures 5A and 5B ). LTbR-dependent FRC maturation was associated not only with the upregulation of PDPN ( Figure 5A ) but also with a substantial increase in ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression ( Figure 5C ). Likewise, EYFP + PDPN lo cells from Ccl19-cre 3 R26-eyfp LNs expressed moderate amounts of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 ( Figure S3E ). To further characterize the phenotypical changes associated with LTbRdependent FRC differentiation, we first determined the expression of myofibroblast and pericyte markers in LN stromal cell preparations. As shown in Figure 5D , abortion of FRC maturation was associated with increased Acta2, Cnn1, and Pdgfrb mRNA expression, whereas Pdgfra and Cspg4 mRNA expression was not affected. Confocal microscopy confirmed upregulation of SMA in myofibroblastic FRC precursors surrounding HEVs (Figure 5E ) and in the T cell zone network ( Figure 5F , arrowheads). Likewise, PDGFRb was upregulated in FRC precursors in both locations ( Figure 5G ), whereas perivascularly expressed calponin-1 was specifically upregulated in myofibroblastic cells in the T cell zone network ( Figure 5H ). In contrast, the expression of the pericyte marker NG2 around small blood vessels was not affected by the selective LTbR-deficiency ( Figure 5I ). Thus, myofibroblastic FRC precursors require LTbR stimulation to acquire the characteristic mature phenotype with the expression of homeostatic and immune-regulatory molecules. \n\nTo determine the functional consequences of FRC-specific LTbR-deficiency on intranodal T cell migration, we utilized intravital 2-photon microscopy. Adoptive transfer of C57BL/6 T cells into Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl mice or control mice revealed a significant reduction of T cell speed in the T cell zone parenchyma under conditions of selective LTbR-ablation, with an average speed close to Ccr7 \u00c0/\u00c0 T cells ( Figure 6A ). In contrast, T cell speed around HEVs was not affected by the absence of mature FRCs ( Figure 6A ). Because T cell motility within the T cell zone parenchyma is partially dependent on CCR7-mediated signals (Worbs et al., 2007;  Figure 6A ), we assessed whether LTbR-dependent FRC maturation with upregulation of CCR7 ligands impacts on dendritic cell (DC)-CD8 + T cell interaction. To this end, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-specific CD8 + T cells expressing a T cell receptor recognizing the H2-K b -binding S598 epitope were adoptively transferred into Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl or LTbR-competent control mice. Subsequent subcutaneous injection of S598-pulsed DCs revealed that the conditional LTbR ablation did not lead to a reduction of DC-mediated T cell activation (Figures S4A and S4B ). Next, we assessed whether the conditional LTbR-deficiency affects global immune responsiveness in Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl mice by using systemic infection with the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) WE strain, which is controlled in a CD8 + T cell and perforin-dependent manner (K\u00e4 gi et al., 1994) . Conditionally LTbR-deficient mice failed to reduce viral titers in LNs and to clear the virus from peripheral organs such as the kidney by day 8 postinfection ( Figure S4C ). Furthermore, Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl mice showed significantly reduced antiviral T cell responses in LNs ( Figure S4D ), indicating a globally reduced capacity to cope with viral infections when LN FRCs fail to generate an immune-stimulatory environment. However, under conditions of systemic LCMV distribution, other factors than deficient LN Immunity Lymphotoxin-b Receptor-Dependent FRC Maturation FRC maturation, such as the lack of PPs, could have contributed to the observed immunodeficiency in Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl mice. Therefore, we resorted to an infection system with exclusive replication in a tissue-draining LN. Following intranasal application, the murine coronavirus MHV establishes an infection in the dendritic cells (Cervantes-Barragan et al., 2012b) and both CD8 + and CD4 + T cells (Bergmann et al., 2006) . To assess the impact of the relative deficiency of CCR7 ligands in LN stromal cells of Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl mice, we compared conditionally LTbR-deficient mice with plt/plt mice, which lack the expression of CCR7 ligands specifically in secondary lymphoid organs (Gunn et al., 1999) . We found that mice with FRC-specific LTbR deficiency showed a more dramatic weight loss compared to plt/plt mice ( Figure 6B ) and exhibited higher viral titers in the CNS at day 10 postinfection ( Figure 6C ). The failure of both Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl and plt/plt mice to clear the virus from the CNS and hence to prevent weight loss is most likely due to the strongly impaired antiviral T cell response in this vulnerable organ ( Figure 6D ). Interestingly, recruitment of fully activated IFN-g-secreting effector T cells (Figures 6E and 6F ) was reduced in Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl compared to plt/plt mice indicating that the impaired antiviral immunity in Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl mice can only be partially explained by the lack of CCL19 and CCL21 within the CNS-draining LN. Taken together, these data indicate that LTbR-mediated maturation of LN FRCs is critical for the generation of protective antiviral T cell responses.\n\nWhereas the molecular details involved in LTi cell-dependent stimulation of LN development have been thoroughly described (reviewed in Randall et al., 2008; van de Pavert and Mebius, 2010) , the characterization of the stromal side of the LTi-mesenchymal LTo cell interaction has suffered from the lack of suitable tools to dissect ontogeny and function of these cells. We have addressed this need and describe in this study a model based on cell-specific expression of the Cre-recombinase that facilitates the dissection of mesenchymal stromal cell development during LN formation and the definition of critical molecular interactions between mesenchymal stromal and hematopoietic cells.\n\nMesenchymal precursors in the LN anlage express PDPN, but are ICAM-1-and VCAM-1-negative (Cupedo et al., 2004a; White et al., 2007; B\u00e9 n\u00e9 zech et al., 2010) . These precursors develop into the mesenchymal LTo cell defined by intermediate to high ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression and the concomitant upregulation of essential molecules involved in LN organogenesis, including CCL19 (B\u00e9 n\u00e9 zech et al., 2010) Notably, LTbR and the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) are highly expressed on both the mesenchymal precursor and the mesenchymal LTo cell (B\u00e9 n\u00e9 zech et al., 2010) whereby LTbR signaling in the mesenchymal precursor is critical for the transition to the ICAM-1 + VCAM-1 + mesenchymal LTo cells (White et al., 2007) . However, ablation of LTbR signaling in mesenchymal stromal cells in the developing LN, i.e., ICAM-1 + VCAM-1 + stromal cells expressing CCL19 in our model, did not prohibit the formation of LNs and the transition of the mesenchymal stromal cells of the prenatal LN into myofibroblastic FRC precursors (pre-FRCs) in postnatal LNs. Importantly, progression toward the immune-stimulatory, mature FRC was strictly dependent on LTbR signaling. Thus, our data together with previous studies (White et al., 2007; B\u00e9 n\u00e9 zech et al., 2010) indicate that LN mesenchymal stromal cell development is characterized by two distinct developmental windows of critical LTbR signaling, i.e., initially during the transition of the mesenchymal precursor to the mesenchymal LTo cells and as a final maturation stimulus for T cell zone FRCs.\n\nDevelopment of PPs starts with recruitment of hematopoietic LTi cells and CD11c-expressing lymphoid tissue initiator cells Veiga-Fernandes et al., 2007) , which both serve as sources of LTbR ligands. Again, LTbR-mediated stimulation of mesenchymal LTo cells triggers production of homeostatic cytokines and IL-7, which are essential for PP development (Adachi et al., 1998; Finke et al., 2002) . The results of our study indicate that CCL19 expression in developing PP mesenchymal stromal cells occurs during a critical phase of LTbR sensitivity. In contrast, LTbR signaling in Ccl19-Cre + mesenchymal stromal cells in LN anlagen was not mandatory for LN development. However, the presence of the LTbR on endothelial cells appears to be essential during early stages of LN formation . Future studies utilizing the Ccl19-Cre model and other stromal cell-specific Cre-driver mice will provide a comprehensive characterization of the critical LTbR-sensitive stage during LTo development in LNs and PPs.\n\nSeveral functions have been assigned to FRCs in adult LNs, such as the generation of the conduit system to facilitate rapid transfer of small antigens through the T cell zone (Sixt et al., 2005) , regulation of the LN vasculature (Chyou et al., 2008) , coordination of T cell and dendritic cell interaction (Baj\u00e9 noff et al., 2006) , maintenance of T cell homeostasis via IL-7 (Link et al., 2007) , and tolerization of self-reactive T cells . Our analysis indicates that the basic infrastructure of the LN including the conduit system and the HEV network is generated by myofibroblastic FRC-precursors in an LTbRindependent fashion. It remains to be determined whether other receptors involved in lymphoid organogenesis such as RANKL or TNFR1 compensate for the lack of LTbR. Clearly, LTbR-signaling was necessary for the maturation of FRCs from PDPN-negative myofibroblastic precursors and the optimal support of antiviral immunity provided by the adaptive immune system. Following exposure to inflammatory stimuli, FRCs respond with an activation program that leads to upregulation of molecules involved in innate and adaptive immune responses (Vega et al., 2006; Malhotra et al., 2012) . Hence, it is likely the LTbR-mediated stimulation of pre-FRCs serves as a critical switch for global immune responsiveness by unleashing the full immune-stimulatory capacity of the mature FRC.\n\nIn conclusion, our study provides further evidence for a common theme in mesenchymal stromal cell differentiation, namely the LTbR-dependent conversion of a sessile myofibroblast into an immunologically highly active stromal cell. Such profound LTbR-mediated transformation into FRC-like cells has been described for vascular smooth-muscle cells during the formation of organized lymphoid follicles surrounding heavily atherosclerotic aortas (L\u00f6 tzer et al., 2010) . Likewise, follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) that develop in ectopic lymphoid tissues can descend from PDGFRb-expressing perivascular precursors (Krautler et al., 2012) . Interestingly, only the final maturation of Values indicate mean percentage of the initial weight \u00b1 SEM (n = 8 mice per group, one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post test).

(D) T cell responses were determined by tetramer analysis of CNS-infiltrating S598-specific CD8 + T cells (left panel) and intracellular staining for S598-responsive IFN-g-producing CD8 + T cells (middle panel), and M133-responsive IFN-g-producing CD4 + T cells (right panel) on day 10 post infection. Values indicate mean percentages \u00b1 SEM of specific cells in the respective CD8 + or CD4 + T cell population (n = 8 mice per group). See also Figure S4 . (D-F) T cell responses were determined by tetramer analysis of CNS-infiltrating S598-specific CD8 + T cells (D) and intracellular staining for S598-responsive IFN-g-producing CD8 + T cells (E), and M133-responsive IFN-g-producing CD4 + T cells (F) on day 10 postinfection. Values indicate mean percentages \u00b1SEM of specific cells in the respective CD8 + or CD4 + T cell population (n = 8 mice per group).\n\ntiming of LTbR targeting for the attenuation of exaggerated immune responses may be critical (Browning, 2008) , i.e., mesenchymal stromal cell differentiation should be blocked before the stage of the immunologically fully active FRC-or FDC-has been reached.\n\nMice BAC-transgenic C57BL/6N-Tg(Ccl19-Cre) 489Biat (Ccl19-Cre) mice were generated as described previously (Onder et al., 2011) . The coding sequence for the Cre-recombinase and a truncated form of the human CD4 gene, separated by an IRES sequence and including a stop codon, was inserted into Ccl19 exon 1 utilizing the endogenous ATG translation start codon on the 180 kb BAC RP23 446D10 (Invitrogen). Because the Ccl21b gene is in close proximity to Ccl19, the Ccl21b gene was deleted on the BAC by inserting the human CD8 gene into the first exon of the Ccl21b locus. The BAC carried at least 90 kb of sequence upstream of the Ccl19 transcription start site. Integration of the Cre-recombinase was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Modified BACs were screened with 5 0 ATG PCR (forward 5 0 -GCACACGAATGTGGATGTTC-3 0 , reverse 5 0 -CTGCACACAGACAGGAGCAT-3 0 ) and 3 0 polyA PCR (forward 5 0 -ATGTGGCAGTGTCTGCTGAG-3 0 , reverse 5 0 -CCTGTAGCCAGAGGTTG GAG-3 0 ). Founder lines were genotyped by PCR by using the following primers: forward 5 0 -TCTCTGCCCAGAGTCATCCT-3 0 , reverse 5 0 -ATGC TCCTGTCTGTGTGCAG-3 0 . B6.129X1-Gt(ROSA)26Sor tm1Hjf (R26-eyfp) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories. Ltbr fl/fl mice (Wimmer et al., 2012) were described previously. C57BL/6N mice were obtained from Charles River (Sulzfeld, Germany) and plt/plt mice were obtained from the Institute of Laboratory Animal Sciences (University of Zurich, Switzerland). All animals were kept under conventional conditions in individually ventilated cages. Experiments were performed in accordance with Swiss federal and cantonal guidelines (Tierschutzgesetz) under the permission numbers SG11/05 and SG11/04 granted by the Veterinary Office of the Canton of St. Gallen.\n\nLNs were dissected into small pieces and transferred into a 24-well dish filled with RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% FCS, 20 mM HEPES (all from Lonza), 1 mg/ml Collagenase Type IV (Sigma), and 25 mg/ml DNaseI (Applichem). Dissociated LNs were incubated at 37 C for 30 min. After enzymatic digestion, cell suspensions were washed with PBS containing 0.5% FCS and 10 mM EDTA. To enrich the stromal cell fraction, hematopoietic cells were depleted by incubating the cell suspension with MACS anti-CD45 Microbeads and passing over a MACS LS column (Miltenyi).\n\nSingle-cell suspensions were incubated for 20 min at 4 C in PBS containing 1% FCS and 10 mM EDTA with the following fluorescently labeled antibodies: anti-CD45, anti-PDPN, anti-CD31, anti-LTbR, anti-VCAM-1, and anti-ICAM-1 (all from eBioscience), anti-CD3, anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-B220, anti-CD11c, anti-CD11b, anti-F4/80 (all from BD Biosciences). Cells were acquired with a FACS Canto (BD Biosciences) and analyzed by using FlowJo software (Treestar). Cell sorting was performed by using a FACS Aria cell sorter (BD Biosciences).\n\nQuantitative Real-Time PCR Total cellular RNA was extracted from homogenized tissues and sorted cells by using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturers' protocol. cDNA was prepared by using cDNA archive kit (Applied Biosystems) and quantitative RT-PCR was performed by using the Light Cycler-FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Diagnostics) on a LightCycler machine (Roche Diagnostics). mRNA expression was measured by using the following primers: Ccl19 forward CTGCCTCAGATTATCTGCCAT, reverse AGGTAGCG GAAGGCTTTCAC; Ccl21 forward AAGGCAGTGATGGAGGGG, reverse CGGGGTAAGAACAGGATTG; tata-box binding protein (tbp) forward CCTTCACCAATGACTCCTATGAC, reverse CAAGTTTACAGCCAAGATTCAC; Cxcl13 forward ACAGCAACGCTGCTTCTCC, reverse AATCACTCCAGAA CACCTAC; cre forward ATGCTCCTGTCTGTGTGCAG, reverse GGAGGGCA GATCTCCTGTG; Acta2 (QuantiTect Primer Assay QT00140119, QIAGEN); cspg4 (QuantiTect Primer Assay QT00143220); Cnn1 (QuantiTect Primer Assay QT00105420); Pdgfra (QuantiTect Primer Assay QT00140021); Pdgfrb (QuantiTect Primer Assay QT00113148).\n\nLymph nodes were fixed overnight in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde (Merck) at 4 C under agitation. Fixed LNs were embedded in 4% low melting agarose (Invitrogen) in PBS and sectioned with a vibratome (Leica VT-1200). We blocked 20-30 mm thick sections in PBS containing 10% FCS, 1 mg/ml anti-Fcg receptor (BD Biosciences), and 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma). Sections were incubated overnight at 4 C with the following antibodies: anti-PDPN, anti-B220, anti-CD31, anti-CD4, anti-PDGFRb, anti-LyveI, anti-E-Cadherin (all from eBioscience), anti-NG2 (Millipore), anti-SMA (Sigma), anti-EYFP (Clontech), anti-Calponin1, anti-CCL21, anti-CCL19, anti-Collagen I, anti-ERTR-7 (all from Abcam). Unconjugated antibodies were detected with the following secondary antibodies: Dylight649-conjugated anti-rat-IgG, Alexa488-conjugated anti-rabbit-IgG, Dylight549-conjugated anti-syrian hamster-IgG, and Dylight549-conjugated Streptavidin (all purchased from Jackson Immunotools). Microscopical analysis was performed by using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM-710) and images were processed with ZEN 2010 software (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) and Imaris (Bitplane).\n\nMice were injected with 50 mg of 40 kDa FITC-Dextran (Molecular Probes) into the footpad and sacrificed two minutes after injection. Popliteal and inguinal LNs were excised and prepared for immunohistochemistry.\n\nMice received an intravenous injection of fluorescently labeled MECA-79 (15 mg) to label the HEV network. After 15 min, mice were sacrificed, LNs were carefully excised, and surrounding tissue was removed under a stereomicroscope. Sample preparation and OPT was performed as previously described (Kumar et al., 2010) .\n\nPurified T cells were fluorescently labeled with 2.5 mM chloromethyl-benzoyl amino-tetramethylrhodamine (CMTMR) or CFSE for 15 min at 37 C. After washing, labeled T cells were injected intravenously into sex-matched mice, which were 24 hr later anesthetized and surgically prepared to expose the right popliteal lymph node. Two-photon microscopy (2PM) was performed as described (Soriano et al., 2011) .\n\nMice were infected intranasally with 5 3 10 4 pfu of MHV A59 as previously described (Cervantes-Barrag\u00e1 n et al., 2009) . MHV titers were determined by standard plaque assay by using L929 cells. Analysis of MHV-specific CD8 T cell responses was performed by using PE-conjugated MHV S598/H-2K b tetramers (Sanquin, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) as described (Cervantes-Barrag\u00e1 n et al., 2012a). For peptide-specific cytokine production, 10 6 lymphocyte-enriched CNS cells were restimulated with S598 or M133 peptides and IFN-g secretion was determined by flow cytometry as described (Cervantes-Barrag\u00e1 n et al., 2012a) . LCMV infection and assessment of viral titers and antiviral T cell responses were done as described previously (Cervantes-Barrag\u00e1 n et al., 2012b).\n\n2PM and OPT data were analyzed with Volocity (Perkin Elmer). All statistical analyses were performed with Prism 5.0 (Graphpad Software Inc.). Data were analyzed with the nonpaired Student's t test or as indicated in the figure legend. A p value of < 0.05 was considered as significant.\n\nSupplemental Information includes four figures and can be found with this article online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2013.03.012."}
