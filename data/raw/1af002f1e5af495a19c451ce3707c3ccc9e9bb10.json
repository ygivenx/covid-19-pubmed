{"title": "Pulmonary pathology of early phase 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) 1 pneumonia in two patients with lung cancer", "body": "infection (COVID-19) that started in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China [1, 2] , has spread to all 43 parts of China, other parts of Asia such as Japan and Thailand, Australia, Europe and 44 North America. The number of confirmed cases in China has reached 42,700, including 45 1,017 deaths, as of February 11, 2020 [new reference, website]. Patients initially 46 present with fever with or without respiratory symptoms, but all patients later develop 47 various degrees of pulmonary abnormalities on chest CT imaging [1, 3] . Although the vast 48 majority of patients only have a common, mild form of illness, about 15-20% of the 49 patients fall into the severe group, meaning they require assisted oxygenation as part of 50 treatment [3] . The severe group has a high mortality rate and is associated with older age, 51 underlying diseases such as diabetes, and medical procedures (such as patients who were 52 infected in a hospital setting while receiving surgery for other indications). 53 Although there have been several studies describing clinical features and 54 characteristic radiographic findings (mainly chest CT scans) [1, 3] , no pathologic studies 55 have been conducted based on autopsies or biopsies. Some of the reasons for the lack of 56 autopsies and biopsies include the suddenness of the outbreak, the vast patient volume in 57 hospitals, shortage of healthcare personnel, and the high rate of transmission, which 58 makes invasive diagnostic procedures less of a clinical priority.\n\nFortunately and unfortunately, we encountered two patients who underwent 60 surgery for malignancy and were later found to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe surgical specimens overlapped in time with the infection, which offered us the 1A). White blood cell count was 12.49\u00d710 12 /L, while lymphocyte count was lowered to 77 0.4\u00d710 9 /L and the differential to 5%. There was a slight wheezing sound to auscultation 78 on the right side. On Day 16, the patient developed some difficulty in breathing, chest 79 tightness, wheezing, and dry cough. She was diagnosed as \"suspicious for viral 80 pneumonia,\" with intermittent SpO2 between 72% and 88%. On Day 24, she was 81 transferred to the special isolation ward due to a pharyngeal swab test positive for the Subsequent clinical information confirmed that she was exposed to another 91 patient in the same room who was subsequently found to be infected with the 92 2019-nCoV.\n\nThe right middle lobe resection specimen was delivered to the surgical pathology Compared with pathological findings in a cohort of autopsy cases of SARS, the two cases 170 presented here also exhibited exudative and proliferative phase acute lung injury such as 171 edema, inflammatory infiltrate, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, and organization, but 172 9 without obvious hyaline membrane formation and other chronic process such as 173 squamous metaplasia [5] [6] [7] . Of note, pathologic changes seen in our two cases proceeded 174 the development of clinical symptoms, and likely represent an earlier phase of the disease.\n\nFuture studies in autopsies may add to the current findings.
