{"title": "Clinical Characteristics on 25 Discharged Patients with COVID-19 Virus Returning", "body": "Since Dec 8 th 2019, many cases has been reported by investigators who described the clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection [1] [2] [3] . We noticed the recent report 4 from Lan et al. that 4 medical staff were still virus carriers after recovery from COVID-19 infection. Here we gave a report on 25 discharged patients with their medical record review and further analysis.\n\nAll these 25 patients with COVID-19 infection were once hospitalized from Jan 23 th 2020 to Feb 21 th 2020. They all met the following criteria of hospital discharge in China: (1) more than 3 days of normal; (2) significant reduction of respiratory symptoms; (3) substantial improvement over conventional chest radiography detection; (4) consecutively twice negative results of RT-PCR testing with an interval for at least 1 day. Considering the risk of reinfection, they were all self-segregating at home for further observation. Real-time RT-PCR detection were performed as described previously 5 . Other demographic, clinical, radiologic and laboratory findings were extracted from the electronic medical records of the patients.

Notably, the median time from their last negative result to turning positive was 6 (4-10) days. These patients were then hospitalized again and continued the quarantine protocol. All these patients were asymptomatic and chest CT scanning indicated that 12 of them even showed improvement while rest of them represented with no obvious change compared with previous images. With a few days of prophylactic intervention with Chinese herbal medicine, the RT-PCR results of virus mRNA detection were all turning to negative in both nasopharyngeal swab and cloacal swab samples.\n\nFurthermore, correlation analysis indicated that there was a significant inverse correlation existed between serum D-Dimer level and the duration of antiviral treatment (r=-0.637, p=0.002), while lymphocyte concentration significantly positively correlated (r=0.52, p=0.008) with the duration of virus reversal. These implied that the imperfect antivirus therapy probably was responsible for the recurrence of COVID-19 virus.\n\nThese 25 patients with COVID-19 infection all met the criteria for hospital release from quarantine, while the RT-PCR testing then conversed to positive without symptoms after 2 to 13 days. These asymptomatic carriers brought more challenges to the manager and control of COVID-19 epidemic in China and any other affected countries. We further got a glance at the factors associated with COVID-19 clearance. Due to the lack of antiviral drugs with confirmed efficiency on COVID-19, it is possible that some immunological parameters could be used as additional indicators to properly assess the virus activity and the needs for prolonged quarantine in asymptomatic patients. Further case-control study and cohort study will be needed to pursue the indication role on that.\n\nAuthor Contributions: Dr. Yanchao Pan and Lei Liu had full access to all of the data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.
