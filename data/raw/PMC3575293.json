{"title": "Residue analysis of a CTL epitope of SARS-CoV spike protein by IFN-gamma production and bioinformatics prediction", "body": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV\n[1,2]. The fatality rate is as high as 15% for patients younger than 60 years old and can be higher than 50% for patients 60 years or older. Nearly 40% of infected patients develop respiratory failure that requires assistant ventilation\n[3].\n\nCoronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-strand RNA viruses. The virion consists of a nucleocapsid (N) core surrounded by an envelope containing three membrane proteins, spike (S), membrane (M) and envelope (E), which are common to all members of the genus\n[4,5]. The M and E proteins are important for viral particle assembly and N is important for viral RNA packaging. The S protein, which provides the virion with a corona-like appearance, binds to host receptors and mediates membrane fusion\n[6]. The successful development of effective treatments and vaccines against SARS-CoV depends on understanding the roles of various immune effectors in protective immunity and on identifying protective viral antigens recognized by these effector cells. In a preliminary study, the S protein fragment S358\u2013374 was shown to stimulate the production of IFN-\u03b3 by CD8-T cells from immunized BALB/c mice\n[7].\n\nThe capacity of a diverse array of peptides to bind to an individual class I molecule is due to anchor residues in the peptides\n[8]. The surface features of the binding cleft of the class I MHC molecule are complementary to side chains of the anchor residues in the displayed peptide. The amino acid residues lining the binding sites may vary among different class I allelic variants\n[9,10]. Here, an SARS CoV S protein CTL epitope, S366\u2013374, was identified and the functions of individual residues were evaluated by bioinformatics tool prediction and by IFN-\u03b3 responses induced by a series of modified S366\u2013374 peptides.\n\nFemale BALB/c mice, 6\u20138 weeks old, were purchased from Zhongshan University Animal Center (Guangzhou, China) and maintained in our animal care facility under pathogen free conditions. For experimental purposes, six to eight week-old female mice were used. All experiments were performed according to the guidelines in the Institutional Animal Committee of Zhongshan School of Medicine, China.\n\nPlasmids encoding SARS-CoV spike (S) protein was constructed as described\n[11], and kindly provided by Dr. Gary J. Nabel from Vaccine Research Center, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, MD, USA. Plasmid DNA was purified by plasmid-purified kit (QIAGEN, USA). The 260/280 ratios ranged from 1.8 to 2.0. The endotoxin content from purified plasmid DNA was found below 20 U/ml. The endotoxin level within this range had no effect on the immune response.\n\nThe peptides were synthesized by solid phase using an Fmoc strategy\n[12]. 2-Chlorotrityl chloride resin loaded at 1.0 mmol/g (GL BIO Company, Shanghai, China) which was used in peptide synthesis and was chosen as the solid support. N-protected Fmoc amino acids were used. For functionalized amino acids, the following derivatives were used: Fmoc-Cys(trt)-OH, Fmoc-Leu-OH, Fmoc-Val-OH, Fmoc-Gly-OH, Fmoc-Ala-OH, Fmoc-Ser(tBu)-OH, Fmoc-Thr(tBu)-OH, Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-OH, and Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH and were from GL BIO Company (Shanghai, China). The coupling reagent was 2-(1 H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate for all peptides. Syntheses of the different peptides were performed from 0.07 g of 2-Chlorotrityl chloride resin. An excess of 8 eq of each amino acid was used.\n\nFmoc deprotection was performed with a solution of piperidine in dimethylformamide in a 2/8 (v/v) ratio. Final deprotection of the peptides from the resin was performed in a mixture containing trifluoroacetic acid, phenol, water, triisprpylsilane in a 88/5/5/2 (v/v) ratio for 3.5 h. Peptides were then precipitated by addition of cold diethyl ether and dissolved in a mixture of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water/acetonitrile and lyophilized. Purity of all peptides was checked by analytical high performance liquid chromatography on a Waters instrument using a C18 column (Novarpack, 5 \u03bcm, 300 \u00c5, 10.0 \u00d7 200 mm) and all were at least 70% pure (UV detection at 214 and 254 nm). They were characterized by electrospray mass spectrometry.\n\nFemale BALB/c mice were injected (i.m.) with 50 \u03bcg/mouse of SARS-CoV S plasmid DNA in 100 ul of sterile PBS. Mice were boosted twice at 2\u20133 weeks interval.\n\nMice were sacrificed. Spleen from individual mouse was harvested one to two weeks after the final boost vaccination. Single cell suspensions were prepared and plated in a 96-well micro-titer plate at 4 \u00d7 105 cells/200 \u03bcl per well. Pooled SARS CoV S peptides (1 \u03bcg/ml for each) or single peptide (1 \u03bcg/ml) with anti-mouse CD28 mAb (1 \u03bcg/ml) were added to cultures. Supernatants of cell cultures were collected 72 h later, and levels of IFN-\u03b3 were assessed by specific ELISA kit (BD PharMingen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The detection limit of the IFN-\u03b3 assay kit was 3.13 pg/ml.\n\nAssessment of SARS-CoV S-specific IFN-\u03b3 producing cells after vaccination was determined by ELISPOT (Diaclone, France) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. In brief, single cell suspensions were prepared from spleens of mice after vaccination, and plated in 96-well microplate precoated with anti-IFN-\u03b3 antibody specific for ELISPOT. Cells were incubated overnight in the presence or absence of peptide (1 \u03bcg/ml) and anti-CD28 (1 \u03bcg/ml). The plates were then washed and alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-mouse IFN-\u03b3 antibody was added, developed with ready-to-use BCIP/NBT, and read by Champ Spot II ELISPOT reader (Sage Creation, China).\n\nSingle-cell suspensions from spleens of mice after vaccination were stimulated with or without SARS CoV S peptides plus anti-CD28 (1 \u03bcg/ml) for 5 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Brefeldin A (10 \u03bcg/ml, Sigma) was added in the last 4 h incubation. Cells were washed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in PBS buffer containing 0.1% saponin (Sigma), 0.1% BSA and 0.05% NaN3 overnight at 4\u00b0C. Cells were then stained with conjugated mAbs specific for CD4, CD8 and intracellular cytokine IFN-\u03b3 for 20\u20133 0 min at 4\u00b0C in dark. Cells (300,000) were acquired on flow cytometer (BD Calibur) and data were analyzed with FlowJo program, version 6.0 (Tree Star, Inc., USA). Isotype matched controls for cytokines were included in each staining.\n\nT cell epitope prediction tools, ANN, SMM and ARB provided by IEDB are publicly available in a website (http://tools.immuneepitope.org/analyze/html/mhc_binding.html) Version 2009-09-01B.\n\nArtificial Neural Network (ANN) is a connectionist models that consist of a number of interconnected units that can be activated by transmitting signals\n[13,14]. ANN can tolerate a degree of erroneous data, and can classify nonlinear data, which makes them highly suitable for processing noisy biological information. ANN applications have been described for predictions of MHC class I binding peptides and for MHC class II peptides. The prediction accuracy of ANN-based methods was reported to be close to 80% sensitivity and 80% specificity\n[15].\n\nStabilized Matrix Method (SMM) is a T cell epitope predictive tool based on quantitative matrices. It has been successfully applied to predicting peptide binding to MHC molecules, peptide transport by the transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP) and proteasomal cleavage of protein sequences\n[16,17]. The sensitivity of SMM-based methods was reported to be close to 60%\n[18].\n\nAverage Relative Binding (ARB) is a matrix method, which allows combination of searches involving different peptide sizes and alleles into a single global prediction\n[19]. ARB has achieved a favorable performance in predicting MHC I and MHC II molecules\n[20,21].\n\nApplication of these tools was according to prompt dialog box showed in the website. In brief: a) Choose MHC class I model. b) Enter sequence of various peptides. c) Choose prediction method as ANN, SMM and ARB, respectively. d) Specify what to make binding predictions for. Select MHC source species as mouse, allele as H-2Kd, length as 9. e) Specify output. These tools predict IC50 values for peptide binding to specific MHC molecules. IC50 value means binding ability. Note that binding to MHC is necessary but not sufficient for recognition by T cells.\n\nHLA Peptide Binding Predictions tool provided by BioInformatics and Molecular Analysis Section (BIMAS) (http://www-bimas.cit.nih.gov/cgi-bin/molbio/ken_parker_comboform) was used to compare the binding kinetics of peptides. The analysis is based on coefficient tables deduced from the published literature by Dr. Kenneth Parker\n[22]. Application of this tool was according to prompt dialog box provided by the website. Higher half lime value means better binding ability.\n\nStatistical evaluation of differences between means of experimental groups was performed by analysis of variance and a non-parametric two-tailed t test. P value <0.05 was considered to be significant.\n\nTo identify SARS CoV S epitopes, the potential SARS-CoV S epitopes were tested repeatedly by splenocytes from DNA vaccine immunized BALB/c mice. ELISA and ELISPOT results indicated that the adjacent peptides P50 and P51 possessed the same ability to induce IFN-\u03b3 production\n[9]. The overlapping sequence between P50 and P51 (N50, KCYGVSATKL) was synthesized. ELISA (Figure\n1A), ELISPOT (Figure\n1B/D) and FACS results indicated that peptide N50 could induce IFN-\u03b3 production. The FACS results showed that N50 could only induced CD8+ T cells to produce IFN-\u03b3 (Figure\n1C/E).\n\nTo identify the optimal epitope in S365\u2013374, a series of S358\u2013374-derived peptides were synthesized and used to stimulate splenocytes from SARS-CoV S DNA vaccine immunized BALB/c mice. The fraction of IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells was determined by ELISPOT (Figure\n2A), and the level of IFN-\u03b3 in supernatants was measured by ELISA (Figure\n2B). Both results indicated that IFN-\u03b3 was produced only in response to peptides preserving residue L374. Thus, S367\u2013374 (YGVSATKL), S365\u2013374 (KCYGVSATKL), and S364\u2013374 (FKCYGVSATKL) could elicit robust IFN-\u03b3 production. Only S370\u2013374 (SATKL) was inactive, likely due to weak affinity to MHC-I (data not shown). In contrast, L374 deleted peptides, including S369\u2013373 (VSATK), S366\u2013373 (CYGVSATK), and S363\u2013373 (FKCYGVSATK) could not induce IFN-\u03b3 production. The IFN-\u03b3 response induced by S365\u2013374 was much stronger than that induced by S367\u2013374 (P < 0.05).\n\nTo identify the optimal epitope, we analyzed the binding affinity of S365\u2013374 peptides to H-2 Kd, H-2 Dd, and Ld by several bioinformatics tools. The MHC-binding scores were determined by three peptide-binding prediction methods: artificial neural network (ANN)\n[23], stabilized matrix method (SMM)\n[16], and average relative binding (ARB)\n[19]. Predicted binding scores were expressed as IC50 values, which represented the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of the peptide in relation to a particular MHC molecule. The binding affinities of all 9 and 10 amino acid peptide stretches in S358\u2013381 were predicted. The data indicated that the binding of 9 aa peptides was stronger than all 10 aa peptides and that these 9 aa peptides binded with higher affinity to H-2 Kd than to H-2 Dd or H-2 Ld (data not shown). Therefore, we concluded that the optimal epitope should be an H-2 Kd restricted 9 amino acids peptide. In addition, the results demonstrated that S366\u2013374 (CYGVSATKL) was the highest affinity peptide to H-2 Kd (Table\n1).\n\nThe epitope mapping tool BIMAS\n[22] (http://www-bimas.cit.nih.gov) was used to compare the binding kinetics of three peptides containing L374 as the N-terminal peptide (S366\u2013374, S365\u2013374, and S367\u2013374). The half time of disassociation from H-2 Kd of each these molecules was estimated. The score for S366\u2013374 (CYGVSATKL) was 2880, much higher than for S365\u2013374 and S367\u2013374 (Table\n2).\n\nTo elicit an effective IFN-\u03b3 response, an epitope must bind to an MHC molecule first. Artificial neural network (ANN) was used to estimate the binding affinity of single S366\u2013374 mutants to H-2 Kd (Table\n3). The IC50 value of wild type S366\u2013374 (CYGVSATKL) was 59.2 nM. When Y367 and L374 were replaced by alanine (A), lysine (K), or aspartic acid (D), the IC50 value increased dramatically (to more than 28,000 nM), indicating that Y367 and L374 were important for peptide binding and might serve as the main anchors in this epitope.\n\nAlthough G368A (G368 replaced by A) and G368K isoforms of S366\u2013374 possessed higher affinity than wild type S366\u2013374, they could not elicit IFN-\u03b3 responses (Figure\n3), indicating that G368 might directly contact the T-cell receptor. The residues V369, A371, and K373 had functions similar to G368, while the role of S370 was distinct. The IC50 value of S370A was 216.5 nM, about 4 times higher than wild type S366\u2013374. The IC50 values of S370K and S370D were nearly 1000 nM, indicating that S370 might be a weak anchor to H-2 Kd. The role of T372 was similar to S370, as the IC50 values of T372A, T372K, and T372D ranged from nearly 1000 nM to 3000 nM.\n\nTo confirm the key residues in S366\u2013374, 27 analogs were synthesized in which each of the nine residues was replaced by A, K, or D. These peptides were used to stimulate splenocytes from SARS CoV S DNA immunized mice. ELISPOT (Figure\n3A) and ELISA (Figure\n3B) were performed to detect IFN-\u03b3 production.\n\nThe frequency of IFN-\u03b3 producing cells induced by K365A or K365D was similar to that induced by wild type S365\u2013374 (KCYGVSATKL), and there was no obvious difference in the IFN-\u03b3 levels in the culture cell supernatants following peptide treatment. When C366 was replaced by A, the frequency of IFN-\u03b3 producing cells and the IFN-\u03b3 levels in the supernatant were also similar to wild type S365\u2013374. When C366 was replaced by K or D, the frequency of IFN-\u03b3 producing cells was decreased by nearly 50%, and the level of IFN-\u03b3 in the supernatant was much lower than that induced by wild type S365\u2013374. The S370 residue appeared to be more important than C366 for induction of IFN-\u03b3 as IFN-\u03b3 responses induced by S370A were similar to that induced by wild type S365\u2013374, while treatment with S370K and S370D peptides resulted in a 75% lower frequency of IFN-\u03b3 producing cells and a significantly reduced supernatant IFN-\u03b3 concentration compared to wild type S365\u2013374.\n\nThe L374 was also an essential residue in the epitope. No IFN-\u03b3 response was detected in mutated peptides without L374 (Figure\n2). However, when L374 was replaced by A, IFN-\u03b3 responses could still be detected. The frequency of IFN-\u03b3 producing cells following L374A treatment was about half that induced by wild type S365\u2013374. When L374 was replaced by K, some IFN-\u03b3 spot forming units (SFUs) could also be detected. In addition, Y367 was important for IFN-\u03b3 induction; although about 200 SPU per 106 cells could be induced by Y367A or Y367K, the level of IFN-\u03b3 in the supernatant was significantly reduced compared to that induced by wild type S365\u2013374. The K373 residue had a role similar to Y367. When K373 was replaced by A or D, the IFN-\u03b3 responses were similar to those induced by Y367 mutated peptides.\n\nThe most important residues in the epitope were G368, V369, A371, and T372. Almost no IFN-\u03b3 response could be detected when these residues were replaced by A, K, or D.\n\nAs shown in Figure\n4, IFN-\u03b3 responses induced by C366A and S370A were similar to that elicited by wild type S365\u2013374, indicating that C366 and S370 could be replaced by A without affecting peptide function. To further confirm this result, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) was performed. The result showed that C366A and S370A could only stimulate CD8+ T cells to produce IFN-\u03b3, indicating that both were H-2 Kd restricted epitopes.\n\nThe T cell epitopes of the SARS CoV spike protein are well known, but systematic evaluation of the functional and structural roles of each residue has not been reported for these antigenic epitopes\n[24-26]. In the preliminary study\n[7], by using a synthesized peptide pool of SARS CoV S protein to stimulate the splenocytes from SARS CoV S DNA vaccine immunized mice, we identified that the peptides of P50 and P51 could induce IFN-\u03b3 responses. P50 and P51 contained a same animo sequence, N50 (S365-374, KCYGVSATKL). In present study, N50 was synthesized and used to stimulate the splenocytes from immunized mice, ELISA, ELISPOT and FACS results all indicated that N50 contained a main CD8+ T cell epitope (Figure\n1). Moreover, S366\u2013374 (CYGVSATKL) was shown to be an optimal H-2 Kd restricted epitope of the SARS CoV S protein by both bioinformatics prediction (Tables\n1 and\n2) and a functional INF-\u03b3 release assay (Figure\n2, Figure\n3).\n\nTo induce effective T cell responses, the T cell epitope must bind to an MHC molecule. All peptides that bind to class I molecules contain a carboxyl-terminal anchor\n[27,28]. The anchor residues at both ends of the peptide are buried within the binding cleft, holding the peptide firmly in place. A previous study demonstrated that nonameric peptides bound preferentially and that the main contacts between class I MHC molecules were residue 2 at the amino-terminal end and residue 9 at the carboxyl terminus of the nonameric peptide. These anchors were generally hydrophobic residues (e.g., leucine and isoleucine)\n[29].\n\nSite-directed mutagenesis is a powerful tool for probing protein or peptide structure and function. Alanine-scanning, lysine-scanning, or aspartic acid-scanning by systematic replacement of side-chains with alanine, lysine, or aspartic acid have been used widely to study binding sites on proteins\n[22,30]. Analysis of the functional importance of side-chains by mutational study may exaggerate the effect by imposing a structural disturbance or an unusual steric, electrostatic, or hydrophobic interaction. Alanine-scanning is the least disruptive to the peptide structure because alanine is uncharged and has the smallest amino acid side group next to glycine, and thus has been particularly useful for mapping protein functional domains. In contrast, glycine can change the main chain conformation of the protein\n[31], so individual alanine mutations are preferred to infer the roles of individual amino acid residues. Charged residues such as lysine and aspartic acid are capable of forming ion pairs and hydrogen bonds, so they often play an important role in protein binding as well as in the recognition of interacting proteins. Thus, lysine and aspartic acid are often used as substitutes to study electrostatic effects between proteins\n[32].\n\nComputational prediction and modeling of MHC/peptide binding can greatly facilitate peptide screening, with tremendous savings in time and experimental effort. Using these methods, T cell epitopes in many vaccine candidates were identified\n[33,34]. A number of prediction servers are available for identification of peptides that bind MHC molecules. Lin et al. have reported a comparative evaluation of thirty prediction servers for seven human MHC-I molecules. It showed that the best prediction server across all HLA molecules in this study is NETM_ANN, closely followed by IEDB ANN and IEDB SMM\n[35,36].\n\nIn this study, both peptide-binding prediction methods and functional experiments were used to evaluate the roles of the different residues within the optimal epitope S365\u2013374. Though K365 was excluded from this optimal epitope (Tables\n1 and\n2), the wild type S365\u2013374 containing K365 induced a strong IFN-\u03b3 response (Figure\n2). Thus, K365 was included in these synthesized mutant peptides. A comparison of IFN-\u03b3 responses showed that mutants K365A or K365D were as potent as wild type S365\u2013374 (Figure\n3), demonstrating that K365 is not in this optimal epitope and that residue in this position do not influence the function of S366\u2013374.\n\nThe L374 at position P9 was predicted to be the carboxyl-terminal anchor in the epitope by ANN (Table\n3) and the functional experiment confirmed that analogs without L374 could not induce IFN-\u03b3 secretion from immunized mouse splenocytes (Figure\n2). However, L374A could still induce significant IFN-\u03b3 secretion, while L374K and L374D could not, suggesting that electrostatic effects and hydrophobic interaction may play an important role at this position.\n\nResidue 2 at the amino-terminal end is another important anchor in many epitopes. In S366\u2013374, Y367 at position P2 was predicted to be another important anchor by ANN (Table\n3). The functional assay showed that Y367 mutated peptides (Y367A and Y367K) could induce IFN-\u03b3 responses, but that IFN-\u03b3 production was lower than that induced by S366\u2013374. That might indicate an important role for the Y side chain in determining the binding affinity to H-2 Kd[10].\n\nThe S370 at P5 is also a functionally significant residue in this epitope. Though not a traditional anchor, bioinformatics tools indicated that it might act as a weak anchor for H-2 Kd binding. The functional assay indicated that IFN-\u03b3 responses induced by S370 mutant epitopes were stronger than L374 mutant epitopes.\n\nX-ray crystal lographic analyses of peptide-class I MHC complexes has revealed how the peptide-binding cleft in a given MHC molecule interacts stably with peptides\n[37]. Vesselin Mitaksov described the crystal structure of the MHC class I protein H2-Kd in complex with the antigenic peptide TYQRTRALV (Flu) derived from an influenza nucleoprotein. They found that Flu residues Tyr P2, ThrP5, and ValP9 were sequestered into the B, C, and F pockets of the Kd groove, respectively\n[32]. In the sequence of S366\u2013374, the positions Tyr367, Ser370 and Leu374 were at P2, P5, and P9 as well, implying that Tyr367, Ser370 and Leu374 are anchors in this optimal CTL epitope.\n\nAll three bioinformatics tools indicated that C366 was included in this optimal epitope (Table\n1). In its absences, however, S367\u2013374 could still induce an IFN-\u03b3 response, albeit weaker than that induced by wild type S365\u2013374 (Figure\n2). Thus, C366 could influence the function of this epitope. The ANN tool predicated that C366 was not an anchor to H-2Kd and C366 mutant peptides could still induce strong IFN-\u03b3 responses, especially C366A, so our results indicate that C366 is not an important residue for the peptide-TCR interaction. Conversely, mutations of G368, V369, A371, T372, and K373 induced only modest IFN-\u03b3 production, demonstrating that these residues made greater contributions in presenting to TCR in this optimal CTL epitope. As predicated by ANN, T372 contributed to H-2 Kd binding (Table\n3). Indeed, IFN-\u03b3 responses induced by T372 mutant peptides were significantly weaker than peptides containing T372, indicating that T372 might contribute to the TCR interaction.\n\nIn the present study, we demonstrate that S366\u2013374 is an optimal H-2 Kd CTL epitope in the SARS CoV S protein. Moreover, Y367, S370, and L374 are anchors in the epitope, while C366, G368, V369, A371, T372, and K373 may directly interact with TCR on the surface of CD8-T cells.\n\nSARS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome; CoV: Coronavirus; S: Spike protein; SFU: Spot forming unit; FACS: Fluorescence activated cell sorter; CTL: Cytotoxic lymphocyte; BFA: Brefeldin A; ANN: Artificial neural network; SMM: Stabilized matrix method; ARB: Average relative binding.\n\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n\nJH carried out the immunoassays and helped to draft the manuscript.
