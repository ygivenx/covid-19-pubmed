{"title": "Fully Dried Two-Dimensional Paper Network for Enzymatically\nEnhanced Detection of Nucleic Acid Amplicons", "body": "While plate-based enzyme-linked\nimmunosorbent assays (ELISAs) or\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR) is still the gold standard to detect\nviral pathogens,1\u22123 paper-based point-of-care (POC) diagnostics have\nrevolutionized global health care by improving access and efficiency\nof these otherwise complex laboratory assays. Lateral flow immunoassays\n(LFIAs), which are single-channel microfluidic paper devices that\ndetect a pathogen antigen or host antibody response, have miniaturized,\nautomated, and simplified much of the diagnostic process necessary\nfor bacterial and viral pathogen detection.4 The low-cost, long-term stability, and ease-of-use of LFIAs make\nthem advantageous in low-resource settings.5,6 However,\nLFIAs have limited sensitivity and POC accessibility due to the inability\nto easily perform signal enhancement via multistep assays. This is\nbecause the one-dimensional flow from a single sample pad in LFIAs\ndictates that the user manually pipettes each fluid sequentially at\nprecisely timed intervals. The need to perform more complex reactions\nhas given rise to two-dimensional paper networks (2DPNs), which typically\nconsist of more than one fluidic input and multiple carefully designed\nchannels to control fluid flow in the paper-based device.5,6 2DPNs have shown potential for conducting multistep assays in the\npaper, such as amplifying nucleic acids,7 detecting more than one target of interest,8 or enhancing the visual signal at the detection zone compared to\nLFIA alone.9\n\nPrevious works have\nset a promising precedent by using 2DPNs as\na platform to perform ELISAs for protein detection. By tagging nucleic\nacid (NA) amplicons with proteins, ELISAs have been translated for\ndetection of NA samples for improved signal clarity as well.5,7,10 Recent developments in chemical\nligation assays resulting in enzyme-free NA amplification and CRISPR-based\ndiagnostics have created exciting new molecular platforms for rapid\npathogenic detection at low-temperatures and have the potential for\nimproved sensitivities at the POC. However, many of these processes,\nincluding template-assisted rapid assay (TARA), produce low product\nyields (102 amplicons of the initial target concentration)\nwhen compared to loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) or\nPCR (109 amplicons).11,12 To improve this, we\nhave integrated an ELISA into a 2DPN to provide secondary signal enhancement\nin the detection zone. This enables us to maintain a high sensitivity\nfor these low-yield samples.\n\nThe design of a fully integrated\n2DPN ELISA requires optimization\nof the reagent delivery to improve performance and produce reliable\nsignal enhancement.13 Existing 2DPN devices\nare categorized by the location of fluidic inputs: the \u201cleg\u201d\ndesign, where reagent pads are placed at the far end of the leg, which\nthen extends and intersects with the main lateral flow body (typically\nat a 90\u00b0 angle),14 or the \u201clinear\u201d\ndesign, where the reagent pads are placed directly on the main lateral\nflow body.5 Previous 2DPN ELISAs required\nas many as five to six fluid inputs with one or more wet reagents\nthat had to be prepared fresh.5,10 By analyzing these\nlinear and leg designs and performing mathematical modeling of capillary\nflow through various nitrocellulose channel widths, we designed a\ndevice that utilizes a combination of the leg and linear design, as\nwell as a unique delay valve, to sequentially deliver reagents to\nthe detection zone for a fully automated 2DPN ELISA. This enabled\nus to incorporate the enzymatic signal amplification more effectively\nin our sequential flow, reduce the number and volume of washes, and\nallow the user to add only a single rehydrating buffer rather than\nstoring and mixing refrigerated reagents in the field.\n\nHere,\nwe present the development and integration of several innovations\nthat improve reagent flow and 2DPN usability, as well as expand 2DPN\napplicability to detect nucleic acid amplification products. Our device\n(Figure 1) builds upon\nthe previous literature to incorporate fully dried ELISA reagents:\nhorseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody label, its colorimetric\nsubstrate diaminobenzidine (DAB), and redox activator hydrogen peroxide\n(H2O2), which are all hydrated by the application\nof a single solution: phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20\n(PBST). We utilize the high affinity of streptavidin\u2013biotin\nbinding, protein conjugation to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and ELISA-based\nsignal enhancement to optimize the signal output. By using AuNPs that\nare conjugated with both streptavidin and HRP and incorporating all\nreagents as dried source pads, we reduced the number of fluidic inputs\nto four (one sample and three sites of buffer addition), in comparison\nto six used in current paper-based ELISAs.15 Our device demonstrates a limit-of-detection (LOD) of 5 \u00d7 1011 NA copies/mL, which is comparable to other RNA-based assays\nquantified in one-dimensional LFIAs with an enhancement solution.16 Our platform can detect single-stranded DNA\n(ssDNA), double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and peptide nucleic acid (PNA)\nsamples at or above this concentration. This platform is currently\nintended for use with amplified NA samples tagged with carboxyfluorescein\n(FAM) and biotin and can be used to detect any amplification product\nwith these tags.\n\nIn hollow glass capillary\nchannels, as studied in Berthier\u2019s\ncapillary flow resistors,17 the surface\ntension is primarily indicative of the physical properties of the\nfluid, and the cohesion describes fluid interaction with the surrounding\nglass. Nitrocellulose, however, is a porous membrane. As such, the\nenvironment surrounding the fluid varies greatly and can change depending\non the geometry of the channel.\n\nOur one-dimensional flow testing\nresults (Table S3) demonstrate that in\nnitrocellulose legs with very small widths, as the width of the channel\ndecreases, the apparent surface tension of a solution containing DAB\nor AuNPs in nitrocellulose decreases. This is indicated by a channel\nwidth-dependent change in the k parameter (defined\nin Computational Methods) for a given fluid.\nFor example, AuNP flow testing showed a decreasing trend of k = 230.3, k = 126.1, and k = 75.2 for 5, 2, and 1 mm, respectively. A similar trend was seen\nin DAB flow testing results, which had k values of\n326.4, 137.2, and 52.76 for the 5, 2, and 1 mm channels, respectively.\n\nAs the width of the nitrocellulose channel decreases, a reduction\nin the surface tension is observed. This indicates a reduction in\ncapillary pressure, and therefore a decrease in fluid velocity in\nthe channel. While these results contradict findings from Berthier,\nthey do agree with Dharmaraja et al.\u2019s work, which discusses\nthe decreasing channel width as a method to increase \u201cresistance\u201d\nof flow on wetted nitrocellulose when the sequential flow is occurring.18 This more closely matches our reagent delivery\nin the constructed 2DPN. The R2 values\nfor thinner channels (<5 mm) (Table S3) indicate flow that is less consistent than in wider channels. This\ninconsistency was particularly prevalent in the first 15 mm of the\nchannels.\n\nWe made design choices based on\nthe results of our component characterizations and one-dimensional\nflow tests (described in Experimental Methods). The width of the main lateral flow channel for the AuNP-bound\nsample solution was chosen to be 5 mm because it produced the fastest\nand most consistent flow (Figure 2A). The width of the signal enhancement leg for the\nDAB solution was set at 2 mm (Figure 2B) because the fluidic resistance of the smaller channel\nwas designed to reduce the backflow of the fluid from the main channel\ninto the signal enhancement leg. In initial experiments, when the\nfluid from the main channel flowed back into the enhancement leg,\nreaction of SA\u2013HRP\u2013AuNP-bound sample with the DAB began\nbefore sample binding in the detection region. This resulted in reduced\nsample binding at the detection zone and increase smearing or background\nnoise. We found the 2 mm channel alone was not enough to prevent backflow.\nTherefore, we added a 5 \u03bcL \u201cdelay valve\u201d19 (2 \u00d7 5 mm2) near the intersection\nof the 2 mm channel and the 5 mm channel. The capillary pressure exerted\nby the saturation of the signal enhancement leg prevented the backflow\nof the sample from the main channel.\n\nA unique aspect of our design compared to the previous literature\nis the location of the leg\u2013channel intersection downstream\nof the sample pad. Importantly, this allows us to deliver the DAB\nand H2O2 upstream from the detection zone but\ndownstream from the sample pad to prevent premature signal development\nand high background signal at the detection zone. Additionally, the\nintersection is set at a 20\u00b0 angle from the main channel to ensure\nflow in only one direction. Previously, inferior performance for leg\ndevices was reported due to parallel reagent delivery, which results\nin a signal appearing only in the middle of the test zone.5 To ensure this would not be a problem, we assessed\nthe \u201cclean delivery\u201d of each reagent. Clean delivery\nwas defined as each model fluid (food coloring) being delivered across\na minimum of 90% of the 5 mm channel width at the detection zone (Figure 2C). We established\nthat the DAB leg intersection must be a minimum of 10 mm upstream\nof the detection zone for this clean delivery to occur (Figure S4).\n\nThe length of the leg was chosen\nbased on distance and time results\nfrom flow testing to ensure that the DAB and H2O2 arrived at the detection zone after the sample and wash fluids.\nThe volume of the DAB and H2O2 pads was then\nadjusted to compensate for the volume capacity of the nitrocellulose\nleg. Similarly, sample and wash volumes were adjusted based on the\nvolume capacity of the nitrocellulose platform (Table S3).\n\nSeveral innovations set this work apart from\nprevious 2DPNs. We\nperformed rigorous assessment of nine different parameters of the\ndevice design to ensure optimal signal development (Table S4). We did not use a final wash upstream of the DAB\nbecause DAB does not require a \u201cstop solution\u201d to arrest\ncolor development, unlike most other colorimetric enhancement reactions\nincluding gold and silver enhancement and tetramethylbenzidine (TMB).20 Additionally, reducing the number of fluidic\ninputs also decreases the number of user steps.\n\nFollowing one-dimensional flow testing\nstudies and 2DPN optimization, a food coloring timing study was performed\nin the final, fully optimized nitrocellulose design (Figure 2C). Based on the results of\nthese flow studies, the SA\u2013HRP\u2013AuNP-bound sample reached\nthe detection zone at approximately 5 min, followed by clean delivery\nof the wash solution at the detection zone at 10 min. Therefore, the\npre-enhancement signal, occurring prior to DAB and H2O2 delivery, was defined as the signal intensity at 10 min.\nThe DAB and H2O2 signal enhancement solution\narrived at the detection zone at 25 min and produced a reliable signal\nincrease at 40 min. To allow time for the signal enhancement reaction\nto complete, we measured the post-enhancement signal at 60 min although\namplification remained stable between 40 and 90 min (Figure 3A). In the future, scaling\ndown the device size and liquid volumes could reduce some of the total\nflow time. However, it is critical to ensure that the unbound SA\u2013HR\u2013AuNPs\nare fully rinsed to prevent background noise from nonspecific signal\ndevelopment.\n\nIn Figure 3A, our signal is\nabove the visible threshold and maintains steady contrast for consistent\nease of reading at any time past the 40 min mark, up to our final\nmeasurement at 90 min. 2DPNs also maintained this steady-state contrast\nseveral hours after testing (not shown). Lathwal and Sikes have investigated\na number of enzymatic colorimetric enhancement agents for the improvement\nof signal visualization on paper-based diagnostics.20 They found that many common visualization agents did not\nretain distinguishable positive or negative signals after 40 min and\nthat specifically timed reagent additions, wash steps, stop solutions,\nand reading times would be necessary. A previous study showed that\nthe visible threshold for an untrained user without instruction was\nquantified at 0.02 grayscale intensity when normalized to the background\nusing a custom MATLAB program.21,22 Based on this, we used\nthe 0.02 grayscale intensity as the visible threshold for a positive\nresult in our experiments.\n\nIn our experiments,\nin which all components had been dried within the last 7 days, DAB\nsignal enhancement improves the LOD from 1 \u00d7 1012 to\n5 \u00d7 1011 copies/mL (Figure 3C, replicates shown in Figure S5). For 5 \u00d7 1011 copies/mL, the average\nAuNP signal is 0.01, which is well below the 0.02 visible threshold,\nwhile the average DAB-enhanced signal is 0.03. This LOD is comparable\nto that of RNA-based assays in one-dimensional LFIAs with an enhancement\nsolution, which was found to be \u223c1 \u00d7 1011 copies/mL.16Figure 3B demonstrates the ability of our 2DPN enhancement solution\nto increase the intensity of the test line above the visible threshold\nwhen the AuNP signal alone was not visible. Additionally, this visual\nenhancement does not increase the visibility of a negative sample\ntest line and does not create false positives with negative (PBST\nonly) samples.\n\nOthers have presented improvements in signal\nintensity and visibility with viral detection platforms, but few have\nmeasured the true change in LOD in terms of copies/mL. For example,\nthe Richards-Kortum group reports a visual signal increase of 15%\nwith silver enhancement and 25% with gold enhancement.16 We achieved an average 122% increase in signal\nintensity for the dried 2DPN with our LOD sample of 25 \u03bcL containing\n5 \u00d7 1011 copies/mL ssDNA (Table S5). We detected an average signal enhancement of 116% for\nall samples above the LOD. Our device with signal enhancement can\ndetect sample concentrations 5 times smaller than our device with\nAuNPs alone. Therefore, the signal enhancement translates to a five-fold\nreduction in the LOD.\n\nThe\nsignal output of the 2DPN showed test line intensity changes as a\nfunction of sample concentration. The fit of the ELISA (R2 = 0.9771) with our data indicates that our paper-based\ndried reagent ELISA assay can generate results like that of a traditional\nELISA (Figure S7). This demonstrates the\npotential of this paper diagnostic to quantitatively determine sample\nloads, which is crucial for chronic disease monitoring applications.\n\nIncorporating\nall necessary reagents predried on the 2DPN improves\nease-of-use by eliminating reagent preparation steps. It also simplifies\nstoring, packing, and shipping of the devices, which is critical for\nthe translation of 2DPNs into clinical use. Other researchers have\ndried different individual components of the DAB/HRP/H2O2 reaction for LFIAs and 2DPNs, but prior to this work,\nno one had successfully demonstrated and measured LOD improvements\nof all components in a dry state.5,10\n\nWe tested\nthe ability to dry and store all reagents to determine the practicality\nof this device for real-world use. After drying, assembling, and storing\nall components of the 2DPN device for 1, 7, and 28 days, we still\nobserved similarly detectable signals. There were no statistically\nsignificant decreases in the signal intensity after 7 or 28 days of\ndry storage for a sample concentration of 5 \u00d7 1012 dsDNA copies/mL (hybridized probes 1 and 2, Table S1). Although the high concentration sample of 1 \u00d7\n1014 copies/mL on the 2DPN did show a significant decrease\nin signal intensity after 28 days, the intensity remained well above\nthe visible threshold (Figure 4). These results show that our dried SA\u2013HRP\u2013AuNPs,\nDAB, and H2O2 retained activity for at least\n28 days of dry storage on a fully assembled device. Because signal\nintensity at lower sample concentrations did not significantly degrade,\nwe conclude that the sensitivity of our device is the same before\nand after 28 days of storage. In the future, lower sample concentrations\nand devices older than 28 days can be tested to establish the LOD\nof dried 2DPNs after long-term storage.\n\nTo extend\nthe application of our device beyond the detection of a model probe,\nwe tested diluted TARA product on our dried 2DPN (Figure 5A, replicates shown in Figure S6). The TARA reaction can produce detectable\nPNA strands at a concentration \u223c100\u00d7 higher than the initial\ntarget RNA concentration at room temperature in as little as 15 min.11 The average background-subtracted grayscale\nsignal produced by the TARA-amplified sample (10\u00d7 diluted) after\n60 min on the dried 2DPN was 0.08 (Figure 5B). Based on the ELISA calibration curve,\nthis translates to a sample concentration of 2.7 \u00d7 1012 copies/mL (eq 2, Figure S7). Given that 2 \u00d7 1011 copies/mL of target RNA was input into the TARA reaction and the\nTARA reaction was diluted 1:10, the estimated concentration of the\nTARA-amplified sample was 2.7 \u00d7 1013 copies/mL. This\nconfirms that TARA amplifies concentrations \u223c100-fold.\n\nBased on these results, combining TARA and 2DPN technologies could\nresult in a LOD as low as 5 \u00d7 109 copies/mL. Clinical\nsamples from lower respiratory samples (aspirate) of MERS-CoV-infected\npatients had a mean virus concentration/mL of 5.0 \u00d7 106 (maximum 6.3 \u00d7 1010).23 With a combination of TARA and our 2DPN, we could detect samples\nin the upper range of clinically relevant concentrations without the\nneed for heating or multiple pipetting steps. Test results can be\nproduced within as little as 1 h (based on a 15 min amplification,\n5 min sample and reagent application, and 40 min of signal enhancement\non the 2DPN). Further optimization or increased amplification time\nof the TARA reaction and additional characterization of the AuNP\u2013SA\u2013HRP\nsignal enhancement is feasible to further improve overall LOD. Specifically,\nthe amount of signal enhancement on the 2DPN can be further improved\nby characterizing the HRP reagent, as the protein used in this assay\nwas a preconjugated, proprietary SA\u2013HRP product with an unspecified\namount of HRP molecules attached.\n\nWe calculated the cost of\nmaterials for this platform, as seen\nin Table S6. We estimate that the total\ncost of goods for our 2DPN is approximately 1.82 USD. Commercially\navailable one-dimensional LFIAs with an anti-FITC test line and a\nbiotin control are available from 3.75 USD.24 Reported cost estimate calculations for other lab-based LFIAs for\nviral detection platforms to range from 0.8016 to 12.7025 USD. While the general cost\nof materials for any platform should be considered for theoretical\ncommercial translation, over-reliance on cost reduction as a feature\nof POC designs without consideration of other cost factors is an issue\nwe do not want to promote.26 While this\nplatform is considered of low cost from a material perspective, we\nrecognize that significant manufacturing costs may be a barrier to\ncommercialization. Although the assembly of 2DPNs is not as straightforward\nas that of one-dimensional LFIAs, we anticipate that robotic advancements\nsuch as pick-n-place, cut-sheet manufacturing, and roll-to-roll will\nenable scale-up of devices.\n\nWe\nhave demonstrated a 2DPN design that automates the flow of a\nsignal enhancement solution to improve the LOD of nucleic acid samples\nlabeled with FITC and biotin. We improved upon previous 2DPN designs\nthat use DAB as a signal enhancer by reducing the number of fluidic\ninputs and detection time and by incorporating dry storage of all\nnecessary reagents, including a source for reactive hydrogen peroxide.\nOur fully dried device has shown versatility in the ability to detect\nmultiple types of nucleic acid samples, including PNA products from\na room-temperature RNA amplification reaction, TARA. The applicability\nof this 2DPN can be extended to detect a variety of pathogens and\nincorporate other amplification reactions with FITC and biotin-tagged\nproducts. The HRP signal enhancement retains activity after 28 days\nof dry storage on a fully assembled device. The fully dried and assembled\ndevice (after a total of 60 min run time) achieved a LOD of 5 \u00d7\n1011 copies of ssDNA per mL, comparable to other hybridization-based\nnucleic acid detection devices. When combined with TARA, the LOD can\nreach as low as 5 \u00d7 109 target copies/mL and can be\nfurther reduced by using other NA amplification methods with higher\noutputs. The signal in the detection zone is maintained well after\nthe sample is run, reducing the need for the strictly timed reading\nof results.\n\nThese critical advancements enable sample detection\nand enhancement\nof amplified NA products with an average signal enhancement of 116%\nfor samples above the LOD. Our 2DPN produces a signal intensity increase\nmuch greater than commercially available gold or silver enhancement\nsolutions and requires only simple rehydration of pads and folding\nto perform. We determined not only the increase in signal intensity\nbut also how that increase affects the true LOD (in copies/mL), a\npractice we believe should be applied to the design of all LFIAs incorporating\nsignal enhancement agents. This proof-of-concept for a fully dried,\ndeployable 2DPN shows promise for detecting many other pathogens beyond\nMers-CoV and can be employed with other nucleic acid amplification\ntechniques. Our fully dried, automated viral detection platform has\nshown to be a successful proof-of-concept with multiple types of NA\nsamples. These results are promising for the future applications of\nthis technology at the POC.\n\nTo characterize\ncapillary flow parameters necessary to establish\nchannel widths and lengths in our 2DPN, we evaluated and modeled one-dimensional\nflow rates using an extension of the Lucas\u2013Washburn and Darcy\nequations as previously demonstrated by Gosselin et al.27 The flow rate of each of the reagents was analyzed\nusing mathematical models for capillary pressure. Capillary pressure\n(Pc) in a rectangular channel is described\nby the equationwhere \u03b3 is the surface tension,\n\u03b8i is the contact angle of fluid\non each i surface, h is the height\nof the membrane,\nand w is the width of the membrane.28 If we assume a rectangular cross-section of nitrocellulose\nand that particles are diluted in water, then Pc = \u03b3(2 cos (\u03b8)/h + 2 cos (\u03b8)/w), where every\nsurface i is nitrocellulose and \u03b8 is the advancing\ncontact angle of pure water on nitrocellulose. Given that our nitrocellulose\nmembrane, FF80HP (GE Healthcare), has pore size comparable to HF135\n(Millipore),21 which can pass particles\nof up to 0.5 \u03bcm,29 we can assume\nan approximate pore size of 0.5 \u03bcm. For water on 0.45 \u03bcm\npore size nitrocellulose, the advancing contact angle is measured\nto be approximately 40\u00b0.30 The capillary\nforce is then equal to Fcap = Pc \u00d7 hw. Substituting in\nthe expression for Pc, the equation becomes Fcap = \u03b32 cos (\u03b8) (w + h). Due to the low Reynold\u2019s\nnumbers in small capillary channels, the inertial effects can be neglected,\nand the capillary force can be equated to the drag force Fdrag = 6\u03bcVzC,27 where \u03bc is the viscosity of the fluid, V is the velocity, z is the distance traveled in\nthe capillary channel, and C is the geometric constant: C = 2h/w + w/h. Then, 6\u03bcVzC = \u03b32 cos (\u03b8)\n(w + h). Then, rearranging to solve\nfor velocity gives1where nitrocellulose width (w) and height (h) are maintained and k is defined as \u03b3/\u03bc\nand is determined experimentally for\nDAB and AuNP solutions.\n\nReagents used throughout this\nwork include PBST (0.05% Tween 20, Millipore Sigma, Inc., Burlington,\nMA), 40 kDa poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP40) (Millipore Sigma, Inc.,\nBurlington, MA), fraction V bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Biotium, Fremont,\nCA), sucrose (IBI Scientific, Dubuque, IA), poly(ethylene glycol)\n(PEG) (MW 3350 Da, 0.2% w/v), trehalose (Thermo Fisher Scientific,\nNJ), FeSO4-EDTA (Fe-EDTA) (Millipore Sigma, Inc.), and\nmolecular biology water (Thermo Fisher Scientific). DAB and urea hydrogen\nperoxide SigmaFast tablets (#D4168, Millipore Sigma, Inc.) were rehydrated\naccording to product specifications for initial dried enzymatic signal\ntesting. For long-term storage tests, hydrogen peroxide urea-adduct\n(#95314-250G, Millipore Sigma, Inc.,) tablets were crushed into a\npowder.\n\nStreptavidin poly-HRP (SA\u2013HRP, #21140, Pierce\nBiotechnology, Rockford, IL) and 40 nm AuNPs (G-40-100, Cytodiagnostics\nInc., Burlington, ON) for SA\u2013HRP\u2013AuNP conjugation (SA\u2013HRP\u2013AuNPs).\nPolyclonal goat anti-rabbit biotin conjugate (#31822, Thermo Fisher\nScientific). A monoclonal anti-FITC antibody (1F8-1E4, Invitrogen,\nRockford, IL) was used for long-term dry storage tests. Due to product\nchanges and subsequent lack of binding for different lot numbers,\nwe switched antibodies and used polyclonal anti-FITC antibody (20C-CR1056SP,\nFitzgerald, Bath BA1 1BE, U.K.) for LOD dried tests and for the remainder\nof the investigation. All oligonucleotide probes were custom-ordered\nfrom IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA). Food\ncoloring for one-dimensional flow testing (McCormick Assorted Food\nColor & Egg Dye).\n\n2DPN materials for fabrication and storage\ninclude nitrocellulose\n(FF80HP) and the cellulose absorbent pad (#3001-861) from GE Healthcare\nBio-Science Corp. (Pittsburgh, PA), Grafix Dura-Lar Clear Adhesive-Backed\nFilm (Dick Blick Art Materials, Galesburg, IL), glass fiber reagent\nstorage pads (#GFCP103000, Millipore Sigma, Inc.), and silica gel\ndesiccant (S-3903, ULINE, Pleasant Prairie, WI).\n\nThe volume capacity\nof the nitrocellulose membrane and the glass fiber conjugate pads\nwas calculated by determining the dry mass of the membrane using a\nME-T Analytical Balance (Mettler Toledo), submerging the membrane\nin deionized (DI) water for 2 min, and then determining the wet mass\nof the membrane. Using the density of water, the total volume held\nby the membrane segment was calculated and divided by the area of\nthe segment. The volume released from the glass fiber pads was estimated\nby first measuring the wet mass of the membrane. Then, the membrane\nwas placed on nitrocellulose with a 2 mm overlap and covered with\nadhesive. The post-flow mass was measured after leaving the wet membrane\nin contact with nitrocellulose for 20 min. The volume released is\nexpressed as a percentage difference of post-flow mass and wet mass\nrelative to the initial wet mass.\n\nOne-dimensional flow studies were\nperformed with reagents in nitrocellulose channels of varying width.\nLinear nitrocellulose patterns were designed in Adobe Illustrator\nCS6. Designs were 50 mm long with a width of either 1, 2, or 5 mm\nand included a fluid collection segment at the end with an area of\n100 mm2. The nitrocellulose patterns were cut from with\na Silhouette Cameo 3 cutter (Silhouette America, Inc., Lindon, UT).\nThe nitrocellulose was blocked with a solution of 0.25% PVP40, 2%\nBSA, and 5% sucrose in PBST to prevent nonspecific binding.31 The volume used in each test was adjusted for\nthe nitrocellulose and glass fiber pad volume capacity. The sample\nof conjugated AuNPs or prepared DAB was applied to the source pad.\nThe flow was video-recorded with an iPhone 6 at 30 frames per second\nwith a 5 mm reference length in the frame until the fluid front reached\nthe fluid collection segment. The distance and time measurements were\nplotted at the location of the fluid front for each frame in the video.\nThe average velocity was calculated over 5 s intervals. The velocity\nvs distance graphs were fit with a nonlinear curve of eq 1 using the least-squares method\nto find the parameter k using GraphPad Prism v8.\nWe assumed that dynamic viscosity (\u03bc) is constant for each fluid.\nTherefore, we interpret a change in the k value as\na change in surface tension (\u03b3), as surface tension is dependent\non the surrounding environment, as well as the properties of the fluid.\n\nWe created the 2DPN design in the Adobe\nIllustrator software (CS6, Adobe Inc., San Jose, CA). Nitrocellulose\nand adhesive patterns were laser cut with a VLS3.50 laser cutter (Universal\nLaser Systems Inc., Scottsdale, AZ). Adhesive patterns were cut from\nDura-Lar Clear Adhesive. Goat anti-rabbit biotin conjugate (0.2\u20130.4\n\u03bcL of 1.3 mg/mL) was pipetted onto the nitrocellulose for the\ncontrol line. Anti-FTIC antibody (0.2\u20130.4 \u03bcL of 1.5 mg/mL)\nwas pipetted onto the nitrocellulose for the test line. Glass fiber\npads and the cellulose waste pad were hand cut. The 2DPN components\nwere assembled on the adhesive backing, as shown in Figure 1A. 2DPN storage conditions\nare shown in Figure S1.\n\nFor the dried components of the\nAuNP signal and subsequent enzymatic enhancement, we employed specific\nmethods proven by the previous literature to maintain the stability\nof each reagent. SA\u2013HRP was added to each 1 mL of 1 optical\ndensity (OD) 40 nm AuNPs for a final SA\u2013HRP concentration of\n0.01 mg/mL. The solution was incubated on a rocker for 30 min at room\ntemperature. The solution was blocked with the BSA Fraction V (1%\nw/v) for 1 h at room temperature followed by blocking with PEG (0.2%\nw/v) for 1 h at room temperature. The AuNPs were centrifuged at 900\u00d7g for 30 min. The supernatant was discarded, preserving\nthe AuNP pellet. The pellet was resuspended in drying buffer (0.5\u00d7\nPBS, pH 7.4, 10% sucrose, 1% Tween 20, 0.5% BSA Fraction V, 0.2% PEG,\n0.5% PVP40), and the OD was measured using a NanoDrop 2000c (Thermo\nFisher Scientific). OD was adjusted by diluting conjugated AuNPs with\ndrying buffer. Trehalose (4% w/v) and 0.01 M Fe-EDTA were added prior\nto drying. Twenty five microliters of the conjugated SA\u2013HRP\u2013AuNP\nsolution was then deposited on an 8 \u00d7 5 mm2 glass\nfiber pad and dried under vacuum with a desiccant at room temperature\novernight.\n\nTo prepare dry DAB pads, one DAB tablet was rehydrated\nin 500 \u03bcL of PBST, for a concentration of 1.4 mg/mL. Trehalose\n(4% w/v) was added to the DAB solution.10 Fifty microliters of DAB solution was deposited on an 8 \u00d7 10\nmm2 glass fiber pad, then dried under vacuum at room temperature\novernight. H2O2 tablets were crushed into a\npowder, and 2 mg of the tablet powder was affixed on the adhesive\nunder a 50 \u03bcL capacity glass fiber pad.\n\nTo create a hybridized\ndouble-stranded DNA (dsDNA) model, 1 \u03bcL of 100 \u03bcM of 6-carboxyfluorescein\n(FAM)-tagged ssDNA (Table S1, probe 1),\n1 \u03bcL of 100 \u03bcM of biotin-tagged ssDNA (Table S1, probe 2), 10 \u03bcL of 10\u00d7 isothermal amplification\nbuffer I, and 88 \u03bcL of DNase/RNase free water were combined\nin a small PCR tube. The PCR tube was placed in a thermocycler and\nrun on a protocol of 95 \u00b0C for 1 min followed by 25 \u00b0C for\n1 min, for a total of 20 min. The concentration of the probe was determined\nusing a NanoDrop 2000c (50 ng/\u03bcL per 1 OD). The hybridized dsDNA\nprobe was stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until use. Single-stranded\nDNA (ssDNA) tagged with both FAM and biotin (Table S1, probe 3), provided by IDT, was used as the ssDNA model.\n\nVolumes were loaded onto the 2DPN\nas follows: 25 \u03bcL of the NA sample onto pad (1), 25 \u03bcL\nPBST onto pad (2), 5 \u03bcL PBST onto pad (3), and 50 \u03bcL PBST\nonto pad (4) (Figure 1A). Then, the device was folded at the crease to initiate flow through\nthe channels and sealed around the edges. Devices were imaged every\n5 min using a flatbed scanner (V850 Pro, Epson America, Inc., Long\nBeach, CA) at 1200 dpi. For flow visualization, food coloring was\nadded to PBST and deposited on the glass fiber pads. Test and control\nline intensities were analyzed with a custom MATLAB script.21,22 The visible threshold (the visual cutoff for interpreting a test\nline as positive) of the background normalized grayscale intensity\nwas set to 0.02 for all signal analyses according to Phillips et al.22\n\nFor LOD tests, dilutions of 100 \u03bcM\nprobe 3 solution in PBST were used. Tests were run on assembled 2DPNs\nstored between 1 and 7 days. ssDNA was used in the LOD tests because\nthe exact concentration is provided by the manufacturer. NanoDrop\nmeasurements of dsDNA-hybridized probe concentration provide an approximate\nconcentration but cannot provide information on the amount that hybridized\ncompared to remaining nonhybridized strands. The previous analysis\nof dried 2DPN results tested with comparable concentrations of ssDNA\nand dsDNA probes showed no significant differences in intensity (not\nshown). For storage tests, a dsDNA-hybridized probe sample was diluted\nin PBST to approximate concentrations of 1 \u00d7 1014 and\n5 \u00d7 1012 copies/mL. The same dsDNA samples were used\nin all 1-, 7-, and 28-day storage tests. For both LOD and storage\ntests, replicates for any given sample concentration and device condition\nwere performed simultaneously.\n\nFour-parameter logistic (4PL)\nmodels are typically used to model signal intensity as a function\nof sample concentration in ligand-binding assays, such as ELISAs.32 Therefore, we selected this model to evaluate\nour LOD produced by the DAB-enhanced signal (Figure S7).2where y is the signal intensity, x is the log of sample concentration, a is the response\nat 0 concentration, d is the response\nat infinite concentration, c is the concentration\nthat gives a signal intensity halfway between a and d, and b is a slope parameter typically\nnear 1.33 The 4PL model was fit to the\nLOD data in GraphPad Prism v8 with the slope parameter (b) constrained to 1.\n\nTARA is a proprietary\nRNA amplification technology developed by CrossLife Technologies Inc.11 TARA is an enzyme-free chemical ligation assay\nthat leverages a target RNA sequence to initiate hybridization of\na peptide nucleic acid (PNA) backbone containing FAM to a second PNA\nstrand containing biotin. This results in a single PNA strand with\nboth markers (Figure S2). PNA probes to\ndetect the nucleocapsid gene of MERS-CoV were designed using the Applied\nBiosystems Primer Express v2 software (structure and sequence details\nshown in Figure S3 and Table S2). Probe\nhybridization sequences were evaluated by the Basic Local Alignment\nSearch Tool (BLAST) to select regions conserved across multiple transcript\nvariants. For the initial design, target complexity and accessibility\nwere evaluated using Visual OMP (DNA Software Inc., Ann Arbor, MI).\nPNAs were synthesized by PNAbio Inc. (Thousand Oaks, CA). ssRNA at\nan initial concentration of 2.0 \u00d7 1011 copies/mL was\npurchased from IDT. TARA was performed with the ssRNA at room temperature\nfor 15 min. Dilutions of final TARA products were made in PBST and\napplied directly to sample pads on 2DPNs that had been dried and assembled\nwithin the previous 7 days. The same diluted sample was used for all\n2DPN tests. Replicates were performed simultaneously."}
