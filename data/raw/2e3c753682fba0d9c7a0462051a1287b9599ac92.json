{"title": "A comparative multicenter study on the clinical and imaging features of confirmed and unconfirmed patients with COVID19 Authors' names", "body": "Since December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan, in the Hubei province of China (1) . Scientists quickly identified the pathogen from infected patients respiratory epithelial cells and named it as severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-Cov-2)(2). SARS-Cov-2 belongs to beta coronavirus and has 80% similar genetic sequence to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (3) . SARS-Cov-2, as a pathogenic microorganism for a new infectious disease, is currently not well understood by scientists.\n\nWith the spread of the epidemic, 2019 coronavirus disease , the new disease caused by SARS-Cov-2, broke out nationwide and worldwide, especially China, Italy, South Korea, Iran. As to March 10, 2020, a total of 80924 laboratory-confirmed cases had been reported in China, and 32778 confirmed cases overseas, which represents a trend of global spread(4). On 11 March 2020, the world health organization declared the COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Theoretically, the most effective strategy for epidemic is early diagnosis, quarantine and treatment. Therefore, how to diagnose COVID-19 early is of great importance. It's now the period of seasonal influenza, and the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to common respiratory diseases (influenza, common cold, viral pneumonia, etc.), which indicates the differential diagnosis are difficult for clinicians. At present, the diagnostic gold standard for studies had described the differences in clinical characteristics between ICU and non-ICU patients (7) (8) (9) (10) , however very few scientists focused on confirmed and unconfirmed groups (11) . Therefore, we described and compared the epidemiological history, clinical, laboratory characteristics and imaging features between confirmed and unconfirmed COVID-19 groups aim to providing a reference for the COVID-19 differential diagnosis, prevention and treatment.\n\nIn this retrospective multi-center study, 163 consecutive and suspected adult patients were enrolled from three tertiary hospitals in two provinces outside Hubei province of China. Those patients who visited fever emergency clinics at Shanghai General Hospital, High-tech hospital (First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University) and People's Hospital of Yinchun City from January 12, 2020 to February 13, 2020 were arranged for laboratory examinations and chest computed tomography (CT). Each suspected case was quarantined in separate rooms after consultation. Patients were transferred to a specialized hospital after diagnosis. This study was approved by the Ethics of Committees of Shanghai General Hospital Affiliated to School of Medicine of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Informed consent for this retrospective study was waived.\n\nWe retrospectively collected demographic data, medical history, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and CT imaging characteristics of all suspected patients on admission from medical records. Laboratory examinations consisted of blood routine, liver and renal function, electrolyte, coagulation testing, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase, myoglobin, and troponin I, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). We evaluated the presented imaging features (including lesion morphology and distribution features) of all patients with chest CT on admission.\n\nNasopharyngeal swabs or sputum specimens were collected and sent to the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC) for detection of SARS-Cov-2 by RT-PCR tests. Patients with first negative results should receive repeated tests in an interval of at least 1 day. We used forward primer, reverse primer and probe target to envelope gene of SARS-Cov-2. The sequence of forward primer was 5\u02b9-TCAGAATGCCAATCTCCCCAAC-3\u02b9; The sequence of reverse primer was 5\u02b9-AAAGGTCCACCCGATACATTGA-3\u02b9; and The sequence of the probe was 5\u02b9CY5-CTAGTTACACTAGCCATCCTTACTGC-3\u02b9BHQ1. Conditions for the amplifications of the real-time RT-PCR were 50\u00b0C for 15 min, 95\u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 30 s.\n\nAll patients underwent chest CT scan in three hospitals of two provinces in China, 64 patients from Shanghai General Hospital were scanned on SOMATOM Definition All rights reserved.

Examination followed the normal chest protocols. CT scans were performed during end-inspiration with the patient in the supine position.\n\nOverall scan time is 2s, and slice thickness for reconstruction is 1.25 mm. All the reports were issued after two radiologists reviewed the CT images independently and would be concluded by a chief radiologist when opinions diverge.\n\nAll patients with suspected COVID-19 enrolled in this study were diagnosed according to WHO interim guidance (12) . Nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum specimens were collected for RT-PCR tests. All the suspected cases were divided into confirmed and unconfirmed groups according to the results of real-time RT-PCR tests. The confirmed group was defined as a positive result of at least one RT-PCR tests for SARS-Cov-2. The unconfirmed group was defined as all results of RT-PCR tests were negative.\n\nThe data of patients were recorded by Epidata. Normally distributed continuous variables were described as mean \u00b1 SD ( s x \uf0b1 ) and skewed distribution was expressed as the median (interquartile range). Continuous variables were compared using independent t-test if they are normally distributed; otherwise, the Mann-Whitney test was used. Categorical variables were described as frequency rates and percentages.\n\nProportions for categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test or the All rights reserved.

It was found that proportion of males and productive cough in the confirmed group were less than those in the unconfirmed group (P<0.05), while the remaining variables were not significant (P>0.05).\n\nThe laboratory findings of patients are summarized in the Table 2 . On admission, lymphocytopenia was present in 35.5% of the confirmed group, and leukopenia in 24.2%. Most of the confirmed patients had elevated levels of CRP and ESR. Compared with unconfirmed group, confirmed group had significantly lower white blood cell count, neutrophil count and the absolute value of lymphocytes. It also had higher proportion of leukopenia and lymphopenia. ESR and potassium on admission were higher in confirmed group than unconfirmed group, while other laboratory findings did not significantly differ between groups (P>0.05).\n\nThe CT imaging features on admission are shown in Table 3 . On admission, 9 patients did not have CT imaging abnormality in confirmed group. In confirmed group, 42 (67.7%) patients had bilateral lung involvement, 34 (54.8%) showed peripheral distribution, and 46 (74.2%) showed more than 2 affected lobes. Two lobes and all lobes involved were more common, with 18 cases (29.0%) and 13 cases (21.0%) respectively.\n\nCompared with unconfirmed patients, confirmed patients had significantly higher proportion of peripheral, bilateral or lower lung distribution and multi-lobe involvement (P<0.05).

Cavitation, pleural effusion, lymphadenopathy and pulmonary fibrosis were rare. Proportion of GGO, crazy-paving pattern, air bronchogram, and pleural thickening in the confirmed group were also higher (P<0.05). The remaining variables were not (P>0.05).\n\nThis study showed that most patients with COVID-19 had pneumonia, and the most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever, dry cough, myalgia or fatigue.\n\nLess common symptoms were diarrhea, headache, sore throat, upper airway congestion and a small number of severe patients developed chest tightness and dyspnea, indicating that the target cells might be located in the lower airway. This was consistent with the results of previous studies(7-10, 13-15). There were no significant differences in initial clinical symptoms between in Hubei province and outside Hubei province. These nonspecific symptoms are shared by winter respiratory diseases caused by bacteria and viruses, especially influenza. Influenza are usually characterized by fever, myalgia, headache and dry cough, most of which are self-limiting but may also progress to severe conditions, such as pneumonia, myocarditis and death (16, 17) . In addition, severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV) also caused similar clinical symptoms, but more frequent diarrhea symptoms (18, 19) . To the best of our knowledge, this was the first multi-center study to compare the clinical features between confirmed group and unconfirmed group. All rights reserved.

Therefore, clinical symptoms alone were difficult to distinguish from winter respiratory diseases.\n\nOur study showed that the white blood cell count and the absolute value of lymphocytes in confirmed group was significantly lower than that in unconfirmed group. Qin et al demonstrated that lymphocytes counts in most severe COVID-19 patients was reduced, which suggests that SARS-CoV2 might impaired immune system and mainly damaged lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes (20) . This was similar to SARS-CoV, which spread through the respiratory mucosa and infect other cells, triggering a series of inflammatory responses and cytokine storm, resulting in changes in lymphocytes (21) . Therefore, the reduced white blood cell count and lymphocytes could be used as a reference index for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. In addition, the ESR of the confirmed group was significantly higher than that of unconfirmed group, while there was no statistical difference in CRP and procalcitonin between the two groups. Therefore, ESR could help clinicians distinguish between COVID-19 and winter respiratory diseases. Although previous studies had shown that some patients with confirmed COVID-19 had abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), LDH, D-dimer, myoglobin and troponin I, but there was no statistical significance between the two groups in this study. The underlying reason might be that the majority of patients with COVID-19 outside Hubei province were mild infections, with a small proportion of critically ill cases, while hepatic injury, All rights reserved.

Zhao et al showed that the levels of liver function associated markers (ALT, AST and LDH) were significantly higher in confirmed group than in unconfirmed group, but the sample size of the study was very small (11) . Therefore, these laboratory indicators might not provide reference for the differential diagnosis of COVID-19 outside Hubei province.\n\nThe CT imaging features of COVID-19 are diversity. SARS-Cov-2 belongs to \u03b2 coronavirus family, which causes pneumonia with similar imaging features to other coronavirus pneumonia, such as SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (22, 23) . Our study showed that the typical CT imaging features of COVID-19\n\nwere peripherally distributed multifocal GGO with predominance in the lower lung lobe. However, it still had specific imaging characteristics, especially compared to that of influenza A and influenza B. While the manifestations of seasonal influenza are small patch GGO and consolidation with subpleural and/or peribronchial distribution on chest CT(24). Our study indicated that the proportion of GGO, crazy-paving pattern, air bronchogram, and pleural thickening in the confirmed group was significantly higher than that in the unconfirmed group. In terms of the distribution of lesions, the proportion of bilateral, subpleural, lower lung distribution and multi-lobe involvement in the confirmed group was significantly higher than that of the unconfirmed group.\n\nConsidering the high incidence of seasonal influenza, a recent study showed that the most common etiology in all suspected cases was influenza virus infection (25) . Therefore, chest CT could become an effective clinical diagnostic tool for screening All rights reserved.

In this study, 4 cases with asymptomatic infections of the 62 confirmed COVID-19 patients were first detected by chest CT scan and finally confirmed by RT-PCR. Therefore, it could not only be possible to identify patients with negative results of RT-PCR but highly suspicious of COVID-19 for clinicians, but also to screen patients with a clear history of epidemiological exposure but asymptomatic infection. In addition, chest CT was helpful for monitoring the dynamic therapeutic effect of patients during treatment (27) . It was worth noting that 9 of the 62 confirmed COVID-19 patients in this study had no abnormal lesions in chest CT. Therefore, suspected cases with epidemiological history, clinical manifestations and abnormal laboratory tests should be diagnosed combined with the results of RT-PCR test.\n\nOur advantage was that this was the first multi-center study to compare the clinical and imaging features between confirmed and unconfirmed groups. Comparison of the clinical and imaging features between the two groups may help clinicians to differentiate COVID-19 from other pathogen infections and then to screen patients with highly suspected cases.\n\nThere are several limitations in our study. First, although the RT-PCR test is the current gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19, it might still present a certain false-negative rate after repetitions. This is mainly due to the fact that the test samples are mostly pharynx swabs rather than bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and RNA All rights reserved.

Second, we did not complete the tests of influenza A virus, influenza B virus, parainfluenza virus, mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, coxsackie virus, the nucleic acid of influenza viruses A and B and microbial culture in all patients. We could not clearly distinguish the specific pathogen infections in patients with unconfirmed group. Therefore, we did not further compare the differences between COVID-19 and specific pathogen infections. \n\nThe authors state that this work has not received any funding. All rights reserved.
