Randomly primed clones have been characterized and found to be representative of the viral Senome including 5' leader sequences.\n\ncDNA cloning coronavirus IBV oligonucleotide primers\n\nThe cloning of large RNA molecules presents practical problems due to template degradation and premature termination during the reverse transcription reactions.\n\nThe presence of strong stops, probably associated with the formation of RNA secondary structures, results in a decreasing probability of extension from the 3' terminus. While attempting to clone the structural genes of infectious bronchitis virus(IBV), a 20 kilobase (kb), single-stranded RNA virus, no clones extending more than 3.3 kb from 3' poly A region could be obtained using oligo-dT primed cDNA synthesis despite repeated attempts .\n\nTwo approaches towards overcoming the problem were employed. Firstly, a specific oligonucleotide was synthesised with sequence complementary to a region close to the 5' end of the 3.3 kb of clones which we had obtained. This was used to specifically prime cDNA synthesis from this region and resulted in the isolation of clones extending approximately 8 kb from the priming site towards the 5' end of the virus (Binns et al., 1985) . This approach, although successful, is relatively expensive, requires knowledge of specific sequences and requires that a new oligonucleotide be synthesised for each extension of clones required. Although calf thymus otigonucleotides have been used extensively to generate hybridisation probes, they have only infrequently been used for cDNA cloning of randomly primed material (Dowling et al., 1983) . Our second approach involves the use of calf thymus oligonucleotides to randomly prime cDNA synthesis. It is cheap, requires no sequence information and the same oligonucleotide preparation can be used for all ctoning attempts. It also has the advantage that it will effectively generate clones representing the entire RNA sequence required with the possible exception of a small number of bases at the 3' end.\n\nThe detailed procedures used were as follows. Oligodeoxynucleotides were prepared from calf thymus DNA (Sigma) by treatment with pancreatic DNase and size fractionation on DEAE-cellulose (Maniatis et al., 1982) . IBV genomic RNA was prepared for strains M41 and Beaudette as described previously . cDNA synthesis was carried out using the method of Gubler and Hoffman (1983) . cDNA synthesis with approximately 20 ug virion RNA and 100 ug calf thymus oligonucleotide primers was carried out in a reaction volume of 50 ul(50 mM Tris-HCI pH 8.3, 10 mM MgCl,, 10 mM DTT, 4 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1.25 mM dNTPs and 160 U reverse transcriptase [Anglian Biotechnology]) at 43\u00b0C for 30 min. After stopping the reaction with 20 mM EDTA followed by phenol extraction, the products were precipitated with ethanol and ammonium acetate. For second-strand synthesis the products were resuspended in 100 ul of 20 mM Tris-HCI pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl,, 10 mM (NH&SO,, 100 mM KCl, 0.15 mM P-NAD, 50 ug/ml BSA, and 40 pm dNTPs. 22.5 U DNA Polymerase 1 (Biolabs), 2.5 U RNaseH (BRL), and 5 U E. coliDNA ligase (Biolabs) were added to the reaction which was incubated at 12\u00b0C for 60 min and then at 22\u00b0C for 60 min. The products were phenol extracted twice and precipitated with ethanol and ammonium acetate. Double-stranded cDNA was tailed withdC residues, size fractionated on CL Sepharose 4B and cloned into dG tailed Pst l-cleaved pBR322. This material was used to transform E. co/i LE392 by the method of Hanahan (1983) and selection made for tetracycline-resistant colonies. Between 2 and 4 X lo4 tetracycline-resistant clones were obtained in each experiment of which approximately 5'% were derived from uncut vector molecules. Clones were screened for the presence of viral inserts by colony hybridisation (Grunstein and Hogness, 1975) using 32P-labelled, alkali-treated IBV genomic RNA as a probe.\n\nThe viral inserts present in a number of clones which were strongly positive in the colony hybridisation assay were characterised further. Firstly the size of the viral inserts in 24 Beaudette and 24 M41 clones was examined by making 'mini-preparations' of plasmid DNA (Holmes and Quigley, 1981) and digesting the DNA with Pst 1.\n\nAnalysis revealed that these strongly positive clones contained inserts ranging from approximately 600 bp to 3,500 bp with an average size of approximately 1,000 bp. Table 1 shows the details of the M41 clones, the results for the Beaudette clones being similar. Secondly the distribution of the clones along the viral genome was studied by Southern blots (Southern, 1975) using as probes 4 cDNA clones derived from Beaudettegenomic RNA, C5-322, C5-136, MB179,andMB182,whichextendedfrom the3' polyA region to approximately 11.3 kb on the genome (see Fig. 1 ). With each probe one or more of the randomly primed cDNA clones gave a positive signal (see Table I ). About half of the viral positive clones failed to hybridise to any of the probes (which covered 11.3 kb), consistent with estimates of 20 kb for the genomic size of IBV. Clones which failed to hybridise were digested with a range of restriction endonucleases and many were found to possess different restriction sites. Furthermore, results of In one experiment 2,OOOM41 clones were screened with a3~P-labelled oligonu~leotide with a sequence complementary to part of the leader sequence present on the 5' ends of the genome and mRNAs, and which we had previously determined from mRNA A . Eight positive clones were identified. Four were found to have been derived from mRNA A as they contained nucleocapsid gene sequences in addition to leader sequences. This indicates that some mRNA A must copurify with genomic RNA in the virus isolation procedures we use. The other 4clones appear to be genuine genomic leader clones as they do not contain any sequences present in the bodies of IBV mRNAs A, B, C, D, or E as determined by Southern blots. Preliminary sequence data for 2 of the clones shows that 1 clone extends to the 5' end of the virus and the other to within 29 bases of the 5' end (Brown. Boursnell, Tomtey and Binns, in preparation) . In conclusion this paper describes a cDNA cloning protocol that is particularly useful for generating gene banks from large RNA viruses. We had previously used calf thymus primers with 'traditional' cDNA cloning methods employing Sl nuclease but find that the method ofcDNA synthesis used here generates significantly larger clones. The clones obtained have been shown to have a random distribution on the genome and in the case of the leader clones at least 4 clones from our gene bank contained the specific sequence we searched for. The method is to be recommended for its ease, speed, and cheapness."}
