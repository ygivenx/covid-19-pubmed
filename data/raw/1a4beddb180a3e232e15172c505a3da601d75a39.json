The amide unit is one of the most important and widely occurring functional groups; it is present in many natural products and is a key feature of many important drugs. Among the more notable examples of amidecontaining compounds, those found in conjunction with N-heterocycles exhibit diverse and marked pharmacological activities. In particular, the HIV-1 NNRTIs, 1 dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitors, 2 and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors stand out. 3 It is not surprising therefore that there are numerous papers in which amide bond formation has been described. 4 Despite the plethora of available routes, most are plagued with problems, in particular, low yields and difficult workups. As a result, a new and more facile route was sought.\n\nA preliminary search of the literature revealed several known methods for the formation of 2-chloroacetanilides. The most commonly used methodology involves condensation of chloroacetyl chloride with various anilines in aprotic solvents (e.g. ether, dioxane, chloroform, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, or DMF) in the presence of anhydrous K 2 CO 3 , 5 triethylamine 6 or pyridine 7 as the base. Another variant utilizes methylethylketone and CaCO 3 8 while other references describe condensation promoted by triethylamine in acetic acid. 9 Examples of aniline acylation in acetate buffer 10 and aqueous K 2 CO 3 11 are also known, while another approach proposes the synthesis of 2-chloroacetanilides in base-free conditions. In the latter case, the reaction takes place in nonpolar solvent 12 or in a mixed solvent system. 13 Although there are many options available, it is important to note that most of these methods suffer from numerous side reactions arising from either N-quaternization of the organic base or hydrolysis, which lead to low yields and tedious work-up procedures. It has however, been shown that amide bond formation could be achieved by the cleavage of the silicon-nitrogen bonds in TMS-protected alkylamines and anilines by acid halides. 14 The absence of a base renders the silyl method very attractive for the synthesis of 2-chloroacetanilides, as this serves to bypass the problems with side reactions such as quaternization and hydrolysis that are common with the aforementioned routes. Surprisingly, there was no information in the literature for the preparation of 2-chloroacetanilides that utilized the silyl methodology. As a result, we have now employed this approach to synthesize a series of 2-chloroacetanilides, as shown in Scheme 1, which were then used for the synthesis of the desired NNRTIs.\n\nAs shown in Scheme 1, the starting anilines were converted into N-trimethylsilyl derivatives by refluxing in excess HMDS to form the N-silylated intermediates, followed by treatment with chloroacetyl chloride in anhydrous 1,2-dichloroethane to produce target (Table 1) . 15 Notably, this occurred without any of the tar-like by-products typically observed with these reactions.\n\nThe target 2-(1-benzyluracil-3-yl)-N-phenylacetamides 6-13 were then obtained in excellent to almost quantitative yields (78-96%, see Table 2 ) by alkylation of 1-benzyluracils 16 14 with the appropriate 2-chloroacetanilides 1-5 in the presence of a 1.5fold molar excess of K 2 CO 3 in DMF as shown in Scheme 2. 17 In an analogous fashion, N-phenylacetamides 15 and 16 were synthesized starting with 1-benzylthymine 18 and 1-(benzhydryl)uracil, 19 respectively. It should be noted that all the compounds were obtained without suffering the intractable workups or side products the typical procedures have been associated with, thereby making this approach highly attractive to adaptation with other heterocyclic compounds.\n\nCompounds 6-13, 15, and 16 were evaluated as inhibitors against a large set of DNA and RNA viruses. Disappointingly, none of them proved to be active against any of the strains tested including HIV-1, HIV-2, HSV-1, HSV-2, HCMV, VZV, Vaccinia virus, Parainfluenza-3 virus, Reovirus-1, Sindbis virus, Vesicular stomatitis virus, Respiratory syncytial virus, Coxsackie virus B4 or Feline Corona Virus. 20, 21 In summary, while the target NNRTIs synthesized proved inactive, a facile and high-yielding route to N-phenylacetamides was developed, which should prove useful for many synthetic applications employing heterocyclic amides.
