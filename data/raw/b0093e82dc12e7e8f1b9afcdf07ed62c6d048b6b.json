{"title": "Cross-reactive antibodies enhance live attenuated virus infection for increased immunogenicity", "body": "i, JE antibody titers of Group 1 (red; n=23), Group 2 (blue; n=11), Group 3 (cyan; n=14) at day 0 and 1 month after YF vaccination. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01 (Unpaired t-test); Error bars indicate standard error of mean. 5 day 1 post-YF vaccination (n=29), indicated by normalized enrichment scores. All gene-sets have nominal p-values<0.05. Blue-Pink O'Gram in the space of the analyzed GeneSet showing increased expression (pink) of genes belonging to the b, interferon signaling, c, interferon alpha-beta signaling, d, interferon gamma signaling and e, RIG-I MDA5 mediated induction of interferon alpha-beta pathways, at day 3 compared to day 1. Pearson correlation of YF antibody responses with logtransformed KAT2B fold change (day 3 vs day 0) and YF antibody responses in subjects f, without JE pre-vaccination (Group 4) (n=7) or g, with JE pre-vaccination (Treatment group) (n=22).
