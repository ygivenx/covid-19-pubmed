{"title": "Active Surveillance for Influenza A Virus among Swine, Midwestern United States, 2009\u20132011", "body": " Veterinarians who agreed to participate in the study were asked to enroll growing-pig farms (i.e., farms that house pigs 3\u201330 weeks of age) in the midwestern United States that were representative of modern swine production systems and that were owned by producers interested in participating in the study. Producers were allowed to withdraw from the study at any time.\n\nFrom June 2009 through December 2011, participating farms were visited every month for 12\u201324 consecutive months. At each visit, the investigator would meet with the farm manager/owner to decide which pigs were to be sampled. If pigs were all in 1 age group, samples were collected from that group; if pigs were in >1 age group, samples would be collected from the age group closest to 10 weeks, the group most likely to yield the most influenza A virus\u2013positive pigs, per previous reports (20).\n\nA total of 30 nasal swab samples were collected at each visit, enabling us to be 95% confident of detecting at least 1 positive sample when influenza prevalence was at least 10%. Clinically healthy pigs were restrained by a snare, and a nasal swab (Starswab II, Starplex Scientific Inc., Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada) was inserted 2\u20133 inches into the back of each nostril while being rotated. Nasal swabs were labeled with a specific code containing the farm identification number, month, 2-letter state abbreviation, and nasal swab sample number.\n\nDuring the visit, the age of the pigs and respiratory clinical signs (absence or presence of sneezing, coughing, and nasal secretion) among the group members were recorded. Nasal swabs and submission sheets were placed into a Styrofoam container with ice packs and shipped overnight to the laboratory for testing.\n\nAll nasal swab samples were tested at the virology department laboratory of St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital (Memphis, TN, USA). Nasal swab samples were initially screened for influenza A virus by real-time reverse transcription (RRT-PCR) selective for the matrix gene. Samples that were positive by RRT-PCR underwent further diagnostics for determination of subtype, including the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and swine H1 and H3 viruses (21\u201323).\n\nA farm was considered positive for a given month if any of the 30 individually collected swab samples tested positive. Farm-level data, such as farm size, were analyzed by repeated measures logistic regression, and differences between farms were accounted for by including farm as a random effect and allowing for an autoregressive effect by month within the farm. Model building was performed by first screening independent variables through univariate analysis. Variables with a p value <0.25 were retained for the multivariable model. All selected variables were forced in the model including 2-way interactions and were sequentially removed if p value was >0.05.\n\nWe built 2 models. The first model assessed the relationships between farm status (positive vs. negative) for influenza virus and age, year, clinical signs, and season. The second model assessed the relationship between respiratory clinical signs (presence vs. absence) and subtype and season. Season was included in the models by categorizing the 4 seasons as follows: winter (January\u2013March), spring (April\u2013June), summer (July\u2013September), and fall (October\u2013December). Statistical procedures were performed in SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).\n\nA total of 16,170 nasal swab samples from 540 groups of growing pigs from the remaining 32 farms were collected. From the total number of samples collected, 746 (4.6%) were positive for influenza A virus by RRT-PCR, and 178 viruses were isolated from these samples. At least 1 positive sample was detected in 117 (21.7%) groups of pigs; thus, these groups were classified as positive. Of the 32 farms, 29 (90.6%) had at least 1 positive group throughout the study. Of the 117 groups with RRT-PCR\u2013positive results for influenza A virus, complete or partial subtype details were obtained for 99 (84.6%) pig groups (Figure 1). Influenza A virus infection with just 1 subtype (H1N1, H1N2, H3N2, or H1N1pdm09) was detected in 21, 19, 9, and 17 groups, respectively. Dual infections were detected in 10 groups, of which 8 concurrently harbored influenza virus subtypes H1N2 and H1N1pdm09, 1 harbored subtype H1N1 and an H3N-untypeable virus, and the remaining group harbored subtype H1N1 and an H1N-untypeable virus. Partial subtyping information was obtained for 16 pig groups, from which 11, 4 and 1 were infected with an H1N-untypeable, H3N-untypeable, and an H1N-untypeable with pandemic matrix gene virus subtype, respectively. In 18 groups, a subtype could not be defined through either RRT-PCR or sequencing. At most farms in our study, groups of pigs were identified as having multiple and different influenza A viruses detected throughout the surveillance period (Figure 1). Viruses were isolated from 178 swab samples that originated from 62 pig groups.\n\nOf the positive groups, the mean and median numbers of samples positive for influenza A virus by RRT-PCR were 6.4 and 2, respectively. The numbers of positive samples ranged from 1 to 30; most groups (n = 48) had 1 positive sample (Figure 2). There were 15, 10, 4, and 2 groups that had 2, 3, 4, and 5 positive samples, respectively. A total of 13 groups had >20 positive samples, 2 had 29 positive samples, and 1 had 30 positive samples. Although most samples collected from these 13 groups were positive for influenza A virus by RRT-PCR, pigs in only 7 of these groups exhibited clinical signs of influenza-like illness.\n\nThe number of positive groups per farm ranged from 1 to 18. On average, 31% of the groups tested by farm throughout the program were classified as positive (Figure 3). Farms with no influenza A virus\u2013positive results were monitored for \u22481 year but lacked consistency in the testing frequency and time intervals between tests.\n\nThe average age of the pigs in the 540 groups was 13.7 \u00b1 5.7 weeks. Influenza virus was detected in pigs as young as 4 weeks and as old as 30\u201332 weeks of age. Mean age in positive groups was 12.4 \u00b1 5.2 weeks and in negative groups was 13.9 \u00b1 5.8 SD (Figure 4). However, age was not a statistically significant predictor of influenza A virus test status.\n\nRespiratory clinical signs were observed in pigs in 187 (34.6%) of 540 groups. From these 187 groups that reportedly exhibited clinical signs, 43 (22.9%) were positive for influenza A virus. From the 353 groups that exhibited no clinical signs, 74 (20.9%) were positive for influenza virus (Table 1). Even when within-group prevalence of influenza A virus was high, such as in the 13 groups in which >20 samples were positive for influenza A virus, clinical signs of respiratory disease were low. Indeed, clinical signs of influenza-like illness were noted in only 7 of those 13 groups.\n\nThroughout the study, the numbers (proportions) of groups sampled in each season were similar. In winter, 124 (23%) were sampled; in spring, 137 (25%); in summer, 150 (28%); and in fall, 129 (24%) (Table 2).\n\nIn the first model, univariate analysis of all variables (age, season, and year) except clinical signs yielded p<0.25. The multivariable model retained 2 variables: season and age. Odds of positive results for influenza A virus were 2 (95% CI 1.1\u20133.8) times and 1.9 (95% CI 1.0\u20133.5) times higher for groups of pigs tested during the spring and summer, respectively, than for groups tested during the fall. There was no association between the winter season and influenza virus detection. Age was not significantly (p = 0.09) associated with influenza A virus group status; however, the variable was left in the model because of confounding (Table 3).\n\nIn the second model, complete subtype information was available for 81 monthly test results. Because neither subtype nor season was significantly associated with presence of clinical signs at the univariate level (Table 4), no attempts were made to build a multivariate model.\n\nActive surveillance at 32 farms demonstrated that influenza A virus is commonly present in the nasal secretions of pigs; 29 (90.6%) farms had at least 1 positive group throughout the study. Despite this high group or population prevalence, detection of swine influenza A virus in individual samples was low and thereby compatible with previously published findings (10,15\u201318) in which swine influenza A virus detection rates through either virus isolation or RRT-PCR on individual nasal swab samples was \u22645%, presenting a challenge for surveillance programs. However, new sample collection techniques in swine, such as the collection of pen-based oral fluids (e.g., saliva) for antibody and antigen detection are becoming more commonly used because of their practicality and lower testing costs (24); other studies have shown an increased probability of detection, making oral fluid sampling a suitable and essential tool for population surveillance on pig farms (25,26). Asymptomatic carriers of influenza A virus can be detected more efficiently through oral fluid sampling of clinically healthy populations than through nasal swab sampling.\n\nInfluenza A virus persistence in pig populations is not fully understood. In our study, 41% of the positive groups had only 1 positive nasal swab sample. One possible explanation could be that these groups of pigs were sampled either at the beginning or end of an infection. Another possible explanation could be that underlying passive or active immunity enabled transmission to occur at a rather low rate and that transmission remained continuous in and thus perpetuated the infection within the population. However, our study was not designed to measure transmission. In addition, our study did not obtain information regarding the entrance into or exit from the farm by groups of pigs. Therefore, it is possible that the same group of pigs was sampled on consecutive months.\n\nIn our study, the absence of respiratory clinical signs in groups of pigs harboring influenza A virus is notable. This lack of signs could be the result of events such as the presence of antibodies conferred by colostrum ingestion (e.g., maternal immunity), vaccination, or previous exposure; other studies have suggested that low levels of exposure to virus might preclude clinical signs in pigs (27\u201329). Subclinical infections in pigs have public health implications because humans can become infected after coming in contact with apparently healthy pigs that are shedding enough infectious viral particles (5,30\u201332). Subclinical infections are perhaps one of the most common routes for influenza A virus entry into a pig farm because replacement breeding stock or recently weaned animals are constantly moved within and between states and countries. In fact, there is evidence that movement of pigs might have been the cause of dissemination of certain virus lineages within the United States, and subclinical infections might have played a role (33).\n\nPathogenicity of swine influenza A virus can vary among strains within the same subtype (34). From a clinical signs standpoint, experimental infection with influenza A virus has resulted in great variability (29). When swine influenza A virus is part of a co-infection (i.e., with other viruses and/or bacteria), clinical signs are evident (35,36); such co-infections might reflect the health status situation of the groups of pigs used in this study because the likelihood of co-infections in the field was high. However, in our study, the lack of association between virus subtype and clinical signs is difficult to explain. More studies are needed to better understand the role that virus subtypes play on the presence of respiratory signs.\n\nOur study demonstrated that influenza A virus is present in growing pigs throughout the year and that groups of pigs are more likely to have positive test results during the spring and summer than in the fall. This finding is contrary to what has been suggested (7). The previously suggested seasonal trend could have been based on presence of clinical signs that appear during a time of the year when other factors are present (e.g., cold weather, bad air quality inside barns, co-infections) (7,37), which led veterinarians to submit samples to diagnostic laboratories for the detection of influenza A virus. However, as mentioned earlier, subclinical infections might have occurred during warm months, thereby leading to misinterpretation of the information available at that time. Another possible explanation for finding more influenza A virus\u2013positive groups in the spring and summer is the increase of pigs born to primiparous females. This increase in potentially more susceptible growing pigs is a result of increased breeding of gilts (female pigs that have not had their first litter) during late summer, when swine producers often increase the number of gilts bred. These primiparous females often have a lower level of antibody protection to offer to their first litter of piglets. These relatively immunologically naive piglets would often be the group studied in the spring and summer seasons (38), providing a source of susceptible individuals in which viruses circulate during these seasons. \n\nA limitation of our study might be the locations of the farms, which were all in the midwestern United States. Weather conditions and seasons in the midwestern United States might not accurately reflect conditions in other swine-producing areas of the United States, namely, the southeastern and south-central regions. For logistical reasons, neither of these regions was included in this study.\n\nSurveillance will continue to be a useful tool for infectious disease epidemiology because the data it provides will aid in the understanding of the determinants of infection, enabling scientists and practitioners to work toward generation of disease prevention and control strategies (39). Surveillance studies contribute to science by generating data about zoonotic and emerging pathogens (40). Such contributions are true for influenza A virus in swine because emerging influenza viruses have been identified through surveillance programs (15,16). In summary, our study has led to the following 3 conclusions: 1) different influenza viruses circulate simultaneously within pig populations; 2) influenza is present in pigs of different ages at a rather low prevalence throughout the year; and 3) subclinical infections are frequent among groups of pigs. More studies are needed to add to understanding of influenza A virus."}
