{"title": "Identification of quercetin from fruits to immediately fight Zika", "body": "Zika virus was originally isolated from a sentinel rhesus monkey in the Zika Forest of Uganda in 1947 (1) , which is transmitted to humans by Aedes species mosquitoes. Since 2007, large epidemics of Asian genotype Zika virus have been reported around the world (2) (3) (4) . Recently it has been estimated that one-third of the world population will be infected in the near future (5) . Most seriously, Zika infection has been found to be associated with serious sequelae such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and microcephaly in newborn infants of mothers infected with Zika virus during pregnancy (6) (7) (8) (9) , and consequently WHO has declared a public health emergency for Zika virus (10) . Zika virus represents a significant challenge to the public health of the whole world but unfortunately there is no effective vaccine or other therapy available so far.\n\nZika virus with a single stranded, positive sense RNA genome of 10.7 kb belongs to the flavivirus genus, which also contains Dengue, yellow fever, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses (4, 11) . Zika virus shares a high degree of sequence and structural homology with other flaviviruses particularly Dengue virus, thus resulting in immunological cross-reactivity (7). As such, Zika was proposed as the fifth member of the Dengue serocomplex. Seriously, the current Zika outbreaks are largely localized within dengue-endemic areas, it is thus possible that preexisting dengue-induced antibodies may enhance Zika infection by antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), a factor that makes the vaccine approaches extremely challenging (7). Zika genome is translated into a single ~3,500-residue polyprotein, which is further cleaved into 3 structural proteins and 7 non-structural proteins (11) . The correct processing of the polyprotein is essential for replication of all flaviviruses, which requires both host proteases and a viral NS2B-NS3 protease (NS2B-NS3pro) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . As a consequence, the flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro has been well-established to be key targets for developing antiviral All rights reserved.

In particular, the unique concern on the vaccine treatment to Zika and Dengue strongly emphasizes the irreplaceable role of the Zika protease as a target for antiviral drug discovery/design. As facilitated by our previous studies on Dengue NS2B-NS3pro (12), we started to work on Zika NS2B-NS3pro immediately after the outbreak of Zika and now successfully obtained several active forms of recombinant Zika NS2B-NS3pro. Furthermore, we attempted to discover its inhibitors from eatable plants and traditional herbal medicines to fight Zika with no delay. Here we release the result that quercetin, a flavonoid existing in many fruits and vegetables, inhibits Zika NS2B-NS3pro, and subsequently determined its inhibitory activity. For the first time, our study reveals that many fruits, vegetables, leaves and grains, as well as herbals containing quercetin are expected to have anti-Zika activity, and therefor can join in to combat Zika immediately.\n\nAll rights reserved.

From synthetic genes with E. coli preferred codons, we amplified and subsequently cloned the DNA fragments into His-tagged expression vectors.\n\nThe recombinant proteins were expressed in BL 21 cells and then purified by Ni 2+ -affinity chromatography, followed by further purification with FPLC gel-filtration chromatography.\n\nRecombinant protease samples were checked by SDS-PAGE, molecular weights verification with ESI-MS and protein sequencing with time-of-flight-mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). Protein concentration was determined by the UV spectroscopic method with 8 M urea (19) .\n\nAll enzymatic/inhibitory experiments were performed in 50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.5, with a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer in triplicate and data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD. The Zika NS2B-NS3pro we obtained is fully active as judged from its enzymatic activity on a fluorescent substrate Bz-nKRR-AMC (12) .\n\nQuercetin purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Fig 1A) is a flavonoid extensively existing in many fruits, vegetables, leaves and grains such as Carica papaya (Fig 1B) . When Zika NS2B-NS3pro at 50 nM (Fig 1C) was pre-incubated with quercetin at different concentrations, the enzymatic activity was inhibited at a dose-dependent manner (Fig 2A) , indicating that quercetin is an inhibitor of Zika NS2B-NS3pro.

It is interesting to find that quercetin acts as a non-competitive inhibitor for Zika NS2B-NS3pro.\n\nThis clearly suggests that quercetin is an allosteric inhibitor which binds to the site having no direct overlap with the substrate binding pocket of Zika NS2B-NS3pro. We are currently focused on decoding whether quercetin in fact acts as a dynamically-driven allosteric inhibitor as previously observed on other viral proteins (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) . Furthermore, we also attempted to utilize NMR spectroscopy to facilitate the optimization of the inhibitors (26-31). Quercetin is a flavonoid extensively found in many fruits, vegetables, leaves and grains, which have been used as an ingredient in supplements, beverages, or foods. It has been previously documented that quercetin has beneficial health effects ranging from antioxidant to nutraceutical (32). Recently it has also been shown that herbal medicines containing quercetin or quercetin-like molecules showed significant antiviral activities on SARS and Dengue viruses (33-35). Here, for the first time, we provide the experimental evidence that quercetin is also an inhibitor of Zika NS2B-NS3pro, which is absolutely essential for cleaving the Zika polyprotein into functional subunits.
