{"title": "Potential inhibitors for 2019-nCoV coronavirus M protease from clinically approved medicines", "body": "including four strains circulating yearly to cause common cold, and other two strains which the source for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), respectively (Cui et al., 2019; Dhama et al., 2014) .\n\nStarting from December 2019, a novel coronavirus, which was later named 2019-nCoV ('n' stands for novel), was found to cause Severe Acute Respiratory (SARI) symptoms, including fever, dyspnea, asthenia and pneumonia among people in Wuhan, China (Zhu et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Hui et al., 2020) . The first batch of patients infected by 2019-nCoV were almost all connected to a seafood market in Wuhan, which also trades wild animals. Later, contact transmission of 2019-nCoV among humans was confirmed, and the number of infected patients increased rapidly in Wuhan as well as other major cities in China. A series of actions have taken by the Chinese government to control the pandemic of the virus, and effective medical methods are in urgent needs to prevent 2019-nCoV infection and cure the disease.\n\nAmong all know RNA viruses, coronaviruses have the largest genomes ranging from 26 to 32 kb in length (Regenmortel et al., 2000; Schoeman and Fielding, 2019) .\n\nBesides encoding structural proteins, majority part of the coronavirus genome is transcribed and translated into a polypeptide, which encodes proteins essential for viral replication and gene expression (Lai and Holmes, 2001) . The ~306 aa long main protease (M pro ), a key enzyme for coronavirus replication, is also encoded by the polypeptide and responsible for processing the polypeptide into functional proteins (Lai and Holmes, 2001) . The M pro has similar cleavage-site specificity to that of picornavirus 3C protease (3C pro ), thus is also known as 3C-like protease (3CL pro ) (Gorbalenya et al., 1989) . Studies have shown that M pro s of difference coronaviruses are highly conserved in terms of both sequences and 3D structures (Xue et al., 2008) . These features, together with its functional importance, have made M pro an attractive target for the design of anticoronaviral drugs (Xue et al., 2008; Anand et al., 2003) .\n\nTo present, these are still no clinically approved antibodies or drugs specific for coronaviruses, which makes it more difficult for curing 2019-nCoV caused diseases and controlling the associated pandemic. With the hope to identify candidate drugs for 2019-nCoV, we adopted a computational approach to screen for available commercial medicines which may function as inhibitors for the M pro of 2019-nCoV.\n\nA previous attempt to predict drugs for the M pro of SARS-CoV has identified two HIV-1 protease inhibitors, namely lopinavir and ritonavir, as potential candidates, both of which bind to the same target site of M pro . Clinical application of these two drugs on 2019-nCoV patients also appears to be effective, whereas the nearby non-conserved amino acids locate far away from the binding pocket, thus would not affect its structural conservation (Figure 1b) . Virtual docking of lopinavir/ritonavir to 2019-nCoV M pro also showed high binding ability to the pocket site (Figure 1c) , similar to previous report for SARS-CoV M pro . Amino acids Thr24, Thr26, and Asn119 were predicted to be the key residues for binding the drugs (Figure 1c and Supplementary Figure 1) , forming 2 hydrogen bonds with lopinavir and 2 hydrogen bonds with ritonavir, respectively. author/funder.

Basing on these results, we performed virtual docking to screen for commercial medicines in the DrugBank database that could bind to the above mentioned pocket site of 2019-nCoV M pro , and identified 10 candidate clinical medicines (Table 1, Figure 1d and Supplementary Figure 2) . These drugs could form hydrogen bonds with one or more residues among Thr24-Asn28 and Asn119, theoretically, are capable to bind to author/funder. All rights reserved.

Compared to lopinavir/ritonavir, most of these predicted drugs could form more hydrogen bounds with 2019-nCoV M pro , thus may have higher mutation tolerance than lopinavir/ritonavir.\n\nThe binding pockets of these drugs on M pro are conserved between SARS-CoV M pro and 2019-nCoV M pro , indicating the potential of these drugs to function as inhibitors for other coronaviruses with similar M pro binding sites and pocket structures.

The original indications of medicines were collected according to DrugBank descriptions. Virtual screening of medicines with binding potential to the pocket site of 2019-nCoV M pro was performed using the Libdock algorithm of Discovery Studio 3.5 (Accelrys Software Inc). The pocket site of 2019-nCoV M pro was identified by homology comparison to a previous published work . Spatial conformations of medicines were generated using CAESAR algorithm of Discovery Studio 3.5 using default parameters. Maximal hits of the docking process was set to 50."}
