{"title": "Genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis of porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) in Shandong Province, China", "body": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was first discovered in 2009 in Hong Kong from swine fecal samples (Woo et al., 2012) . PDCoV was recognized as the causative agent of acute diarrhoea and vomiting in pigs (Hu et al., 2015; Song et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2014) . Since its appearance, PDCoV has caused significant economic losses for the swine industry worldwide. PDCoV is a member of the genus Deltacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae and is an enveloped virus that has a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) genome of 25.4 kb in length (Lee and Lee, 2015; Phan et al., 2018) . The PDCoV genome has seven major open reading frames (ORFs). Two overlapping ORFs (ORF1a and ORF1b) encode two replication-associated proteins, which are both autoproteolytically cleaved into 15 nonstructural proteins (Nsp2 to Nsp16) Woo et al., 2010) . The remaining ORF encodes the spike protein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleocapsid protein (N). Additionally, three accessory proteins were identified: nonstructural protein 6 (NS6), NS7, and NS7a Luo et al., 2016) .\n\nThe S protein is the most variable protein among the PDCoV genes, with only 96.0 %-100 % amino acid sequence identity between Chinese and American strains (Zhang et al., 2019b) . The S protein plays a pivotal role in the viral entry and stimulates the induction of neutralizing antibodies in the natural host (Chen et al., 2019c; Chiou et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017) . N protein is a conservative target for virological detection by PCR (Lee and Lee, 2015) . N protein also plays an important role in viral pathogenesis Likai et al., 2019; Shi et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2015 Zhang et al., , 2014 . PEDV N protein can antagonize beta interferon and interferon-\u03bb production (Ding et al., 2014; Shan et al., 2018) . SARS-CoV N protein can bind to DNA in vitro (Chen et al., 2007) . hCoV-OC43 N protein interacts with the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) (de Haan and Rottier, T 2005) . The ORF1a region is the most variable region of the PDCoV genome and substitutions, deletions and insertions have been observed in the Nsp2 and Nsp3 coding region in Vietnam, Thailand, and Laos Wang et al., 2015) .\n\nTo determine the molecular epidemiology and genetic variations of PDCoV in China, the partial ORF1a, S protein and N protein genes of 10 PDCoV strains from different pig farms located in Shandong Province were sequenced and analysed. This study may provide valuable information for the molecular epidemiology of PDCoV and its emerging variants in China.\n\nTo monitor the prevalence and sequence properties of PDCoV in Shandong Province, China, a total of 58 porcine samples, including 21 faecal samples and 37 intestinal samples, were collected from different commercial swine from September 2017 to December 2018. All samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C and were subsequently used for RNA extraction.\n\nRNAs were extracted from the samples using the RNAeasy mini kit (TaKaRa BIO INC., Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To detect, differentiate and sequence PDCoV, the One Step RT-PCR kit (TaKaRa Co., Dalian, China) was used to synthesis cDNA.\n\nTen PDCoV-positive samples were selected for the partial ORF1a, S protein and N protein sequences. The primer sets are listed in Table 1 . TGEV, PEDV and PoRV were detected as described previously (Wang et al., 2018c) . The PCR conditions were as follows: an initial PCR activation temperature of 95\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 55\u00b0C\u223c65\u00b0C for 50 s, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 120 s and another extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. The PCR products were ligated into the pMD18-T cloning vector (Ta-KaRa Co., Dalian, China) and sequenced.\n\nThe partial ORF1a, S protein and N protein sequences of PDCoV were independently used for sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were Table 1 List of primers used in the study.\n\nPrimer sequence (5\u2032-3\u2032) Size (bp) Target Genes\n\nPDCoV S1-F 5\u2032-ATGCAGAGAGCTCTATTGATTATGAC-3\u2032 1763 bp S1 PDCoV S1-R 5\u2032-AACTTGCAAGTACTCCGTCTGAACG-3\u2032 W. Sun, et al. Virus Research 278 (2020) 197869 assessed using BioEdit 7.0. All the sequences were aligned using the MEGA5 program, and phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbour-joining method. The reliability of the branching orders was evaluated by the bootstrap test (n = 1,000). After nucleotide homology comparison and screening, 29 representative strains were selected from 102 strains for molecular evolutionary analyses (Tables 2 and S1 ). In addition, these strain sequences have been previously published as reference sequences (Suzuki et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019a, c; Zhang et al., 2019d) .\n\nTwelve of fifty-eight (20.68 %) field samples were positive for PDCoV, while the PEDV infection rate was 34.48 % (20/58), and the coinfection rate of PEDV and PDCoV was up to 50.00 % (10/20). 12 PDCoV positive samples were identified from 4 faecal samples and 8 intestinal samples. PRV was identified in 5 of 58 samples. Two of fiftyeight samples were found to be positive for TGEV. PRV/PEDV and TGEV/PEDV co-infections were 15.00 % (3/20) and 5.00 % (1/20), respectively. None of the PDCoV-positive samples were positive for TGEV and PRV. PDCoV/PEDV co-infections were the most common.\n\nTo obtain the sequence, the complete S protein, N protein and partial ORF1a genes were amplified in 10 PDCoV-positive samples ( Table 1) 3.2. Phylogenetic analysis of the S, N and partial ORF1a/1b genes\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the S protein sequences indicated that all strains worldwide can be categorized into three lineages: the China lineage, USA/Japan/South Korea lineage and Vietnam/Laos/Thailand lineage. All new PDCoVs strains from Shandong in our study belonged to the China lineage (Fig. 1A) . W. Sun, et al. Virus Research 278 (2020) 197869 The sequence alignment results showed that these new strains shared nucleotide sequence homologies of 97.5 %-99.9 % with each other. They also shared up to 96. \n\nA phylogenetic tree was constructed using the N protein sequences from the strains isolated from Shandong and the references strains (Fig. 1B) . SD07-2018, SD11-2018 and SD12-2018 with CHN-HG-2017 were classified in a group. Seven strains and HNZK-02 and CH/ JXJGGS01/2016 were classified in a branch.\n\nThe deduced amino acid identity values of N protein sequences were analysed, and shared nucleotide sequence homologies of 98.4 %-99.9 % were found among 10 strains. They shared 97.9-99.3 %, 98.3 %-98.9 %, and 97.3 %-98.9 % sequence identity with the China lineage strains, USA/Japan/South Korea lineage strains and Viet Nam/Laos/Thailand lineage strains, respectively.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 2 , all the PDCoV N protein sequences were the same length (1029 nt) and encoded 342 amino acid residues. Compared to other structural proteins, N protein is the most conserved structural proteins and remains the primary target protein for current diagnostic tests (McBride et al., 2014) . Recently, a recombinant N protein-based indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (rPDCoV-N-ELISA) was established to detect PDCoV IgG antibodies (Su et al., 2016) . Similar ELISA test has been done in Taiwan (Hsu et al., 2018) . (Tan et al., 2006) . PDCOV is difficult to isolate and there are few reverse genetic studies. So far, there have been no related reports that mutations in key amino acids of the N protein will affect the current diagnostic tests.\n\nA phylogenetic tree was generated based on the deduced aa sequence of the partial ORF1 gene. \n\nCompared with the USA/Japan/South Korea lineage and Vietnam/ Laos/Thailand lineage strains, the China lineage strains have 3-nt TAA deletions (52 N), leading to the lack of an asparagine in the S gene. This may be the most important feature of the Chinese lineage strains, except for CH/Jiangsu/2014 (Zhang et al., 2019d) . Sequence analysis showed that 27 aa mutations were detected in S1 (Fig. 3) . PDCoV employs host aminopeptidase N (APN) as an entry receptor and interacts with APN via domain B of its S1 protein (residues 298-425) Shang et al., 2018) . The S1 protein region mutation (re- \n\nThe partial ORF1a gene has the highest genetic diversity in the genomes of the PDCoV strains (Xu et al., 2018) . To determine whether the strains in this study possessed the characteristic deletions in the ORF1a gene found in the Thailand PDCoVs previously described, the partial ORF1a sequences containing the Nsp2 and Nsp3 hypervariable region (HVR) from 10 PDCoV strains were sequenced and aligned with the reference isolates, especially those with known pathogenicity, W. Sun, et al. Virus Research 278 (2020) 197869 Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), also named as Swine enteric alphacoronavirus (SeACoV) (Fu et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2018) and PDCoV. Outbreaks of these enteric coronaviruses have been reported in China, causing substantial economic losses in the swine industry (Qing et al., 2016; Zeng et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2019) . In 2014, PDCoV was first detected in China, causing tremendous financial losses in the swine industry, and the virus has rapidly spread nationwide Liu et al., 2018; Mai et al., 2018a; Song et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2018b) . Thus, the molecular characterization of these PDCoVs is a major focus of Chinese virological research.\n\nAlthough several studies have shown an obvious increase in the genomic diversity of PDCoV in China Liang et al., 2019; Mai et al., 2018b) , previous studies have focused mainly on the S genes, while the genetics of the Chinese PDCoVs based on the ORF1 gene are not well characterized. The Vietnam/Laos/Thailand lineage strains had 6-nt (AGTTTG) and 9-nt (GAGCCAGTC) deletions in ORF1a (Le et al., 2018) . In 2015, only a few strains with similar deletions have been reported in China, such as the CH/Sichuan/S27/2012 strain with the 6-nt and 9-nt deletions in the ORF1a . The ORF1a deletion region encoded Nsp2 and Nsp3 proteins. The Nsp3 protein acts as a scaffold protein to interact with itself and bind other viral Nsps or host proteins (Nogales et al., 2012; Yuan et al., 2015) . Nsp3 protein contains one or two papain-like protease (PLpro) domain (s) with deubiquitinating (DUB) and deISGylating activities in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Alfuwaires et al., 2017; Neuman, 2016) . In MHV, the Nsp3 protein ubiquitin-like domains could interfere with pathways involving ubiquitinylated or ISGylated host targets, thereby leading to the disruption of host anti-viral signal transduction or protein degradation (Chen and Makino, 2004) . Nsp3 protein was also recommended as a marker for monitoring coronavirus evolution and for surveying the molecular epidemiology in lineage C betaCoVs (Forni et al., 2016) . Additionally, the MERS-CoV Nsp3 Arg911Cys mutation is an example of adaptive evolution (Shokri et al., 2019) . In TGEV Nsps 2, 3, and 8 were incorporated into the CoV virions, involving in CoV replication (Nogales et al., 2012) .\n\nMutation and recombination are important mechanisms for PDCoV evolution. The USA/Japan/South Korea lineage strains were characterized by no discontinuous deletions in the Nsp2 and Nsp3 coding regions, while the Vietnam/Laos/Thailand lineage strains showed a discontinuous 5-aa deletion (2aa+3aa) at 400-401 and 758-760 in the Nsp2 and Nsp3 coding regions. These regional deletions were also observed in a Chinese CH/Sichuan/S27/2012 strain. Here, we found 5 novel strains with the same deletion pattern of \"2 + 3aa\" in the Nsp2 and Nsp3 coding regions. Interestingly, the SD12-2018 and CHN-HG-2017 strains have a continuous \"0 + 3aa\" in the Nsp3 deletion at 758-760. Additionally, SD07-2018, SD09-2018, SD10-2018 and SD11-2018 strains have a continuous \"0 + 7aa\" deletion at 755-761 in Nsp3. Two continuous aa deletion in Nsp2 was also identified in a Chinese strain, SD, which has two\"2 + 0aa\" deletions at position 400-401. Remarkably, natural deletions and insertions occurred in the ORF1a sequence, and these have led to genome size differences among PDCoV strains. However, the role of double deletions in the ORF1 of this virus remains unclear. Thus, the current results indicate that the novel deletion of Nsp2 and Nsp3 may provide another approach to the diagnosis.\n\nThe PDCoV S protein is a glycoprotein of approximately 1383 amino acids aa with an apparent molecular mass of 180 kDa. Studies of genomic sequences analyses using S protein genes have shown that PDCoV can be further divided into three lineages: the China lineage, USA/Japan/South Korea lineage and Vietnam/Laos/Thailand lineage Zhang et al., 2019d) . The Vietnam/Laos/Thailand lineage has been detected in Southeast Asia (Janetanakit et al., 2016; Lorsirigool et al., 2017 Lorsirigool et al., , 2016 Saeng-Chuto et al., 2017) . The USA/Japan/South Korea lineage has a worldwide distribution (Jang et al., 2017; Nelson et al., 2019; Niederwerder and Hesse, 2018; Perez-Rivera et al., 2019; Suzuki et al., 2018) . The China lineage has been the predominant lineage in China since 2014 Zhang et al., 2019a) . S protein-based phylogenetic trees showed that 7 strains belonging to the China lineage were classified into a minor branch with CHN-HG-2017. The evidence showed that the PDCoV strains of China have genetic diversity.\n\nThe PDCoV spike (S) protein comprises S1, a receptor-binding subunit, and S2, a membrane fusion subunit. The S1 domain is important for recognizing and binding to cell receptors. Additionally, the S1 domain contains several neutralizing epitopes that stimulate the induction of neutralizing antibodies. The S2 domain is involved in triggering the fusion of the viral envelope and target cell membrane. W. Sun, et al. Virus Research 278 (2020) 197869 Therefore, the S protein has been the primary target for the development of vaccines against PDCoV and for determining genetic relatedness among PDCoV isolates. In this study, compared with the USA/ Japan/South Korea lineage and Vietnam/Laos/Thailand lineage strains, the 10 strains showed one amino acid (52 N) deletion in the S protein. A comparison of the antigenic index profiles of the S protein among the IL/2014/026PDV_P11, CHN-HG-2017, and Vietnam/Binh21/2015 lineage strains and SD-06-2018 indicated that in SD-06-2018 the deletion region appears to have a higher degree of antigenic change than that of other strains, indicating it may be involved in PDCoV immune escape. S1 NTD has higher sequence variability (Fig. 5) . The N protein is the predominant antigen produced in coronavirusinfected cells, making it a major viral target (Kocherhans et al., 2001) . The coronavirus N protein is a multifunctional protein involved in virus assembly, translation, apoptosis induction and host innate immune defence. SARS-CoV N protein not only modulates the host cell cycle by regulating cyclin-CDK activity but also inhibits the synthesis of type-1 interferon (1 F N) (Chang et al., 2014; Liao et al., 2005) . PDCoV N protein suppressed Sendai virus (SEV)-induced IFN-\u03b2 production and transcription factor IRF3 activation (Chen et al., 2019a) . Furthermore, the N-terminal region (1-246 aa) interacts with pRIG-I and interferes with its function (Chen et al., 2019a) . The N protein analysed showed few differences among the three lineage strains. They shared 97.3 %-99.3 % sequence identity with the three lineage strains.\n\nAnalysis showed that the N protein and S protein evolutionary rates are inconsistent. N protein is the general target for PDCoV detection, and the genetic extent of variability should be evaluated carefully.\n\nIn summary, this study provides more information about the deletion and genetic diversity of PDCoV. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these strains belonged to the Chinese lineage. Meanwhile, new PDCoV strains with different patterns of deletions in Nsp2 and Nsp3 are emerging, and these strains may lead to increased pathogenicity of the virus. Our study provides useful information to prevent PDCoV in China.\n\nThe authors declared no potential conflict of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}
