{"title": "Structure-Based Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of a Series of Novel and Reversible Inhibitors for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus Papain-Like Protease", "body": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a contagious and fatal respiratory illness, was first reported in Guangdong province, China, in November 2002. 1 It rapidly spread to other Asian countries, North America, and Europe, creating panic to both the public and the World Health Organization (WHO). The emergence of SARS affected more than 8000 individuals and caused 774 deaths within a few months. 6 Quite remarkably, the spread of SARS-CoV was effectively halted within months after the initial outbreaks through public health measures. Through a concerted effort monitored by the WHO, scientists determined that SARS is caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV. 2,3,3b The more recent isolation of strains from zoonotic origins thought to be the reservoir for SARS-CoV, emphasizes the possibility of a reemergence. 4, 5 It is quite alarming just how rapidly a contagious illness can spread in the more mobile and highly interconnected world of the 21st century. While there are no new reports of SARS cases, there is no guarantee that this outbreak will not strike again. Therefore, development of antivirals effective against SARS-CoV is important for future outbreaks.\n\nThe identification of biochemical events critical to the coronaviral lifecycle has provided a number of significant targets for halting viral replication. One of the early and essential processes is the cleavage of a multidomain, viral polyprotein into 16 individual components termed non-structural proteins, or nsps. These proteins assemble into complexes to execute viral RNA synthesis. 7 Two cysteine proteases, a papain-like protease (PLpro) and a 3C-like protease (3CLpro), reside within the polyprotein. They catalyze their own release and that of the other nsps from the polyprotein and initiate virus-mediated RNA replication. Since 2003, numerous biochemical, structural and inhibitor development studies have been directed at the 3CLpro enzyme 8 , which cleaves eleven sites within the polyprotein. Recently, we reported potent inhibitors of 3CLpro that have shown antiviral activity against SARS-CoV. 9 Recent structural and functional studies directed at PLpro have suggested potential roles for this protease beyond viral peptide cleavage, including deubiquitination, deISGylation, and involvement in virus evasion of the innate immune response. 10, 11 Furthermore, studies have shown that the homologous enzyme, PLP2, from the human coronavirus 229E, is essential for 229E viral replication. 12 Therefore, PLpro has emerged as a significant drug development target. Our screening of a structurally diverse library of 50,080 compounds led to the discovery of a noncovalent lead inhibitor 1 (7724772, Figure 1 ), with an IC 50 value of 20 \u03bcM as a racemic mixture. 13 Subsequent SAR studies and lead optimization provided potent inhibitor 24 (IC 50 = 600 nM) which also inhibits SARS-CoV viral replication in Vero cells with an EC 50 value of 15 \u03bcM. 13 In these studies, we also reported the X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV PLpro bound to inhibitor 24, which revealed important molecular insight into the ligand-binding site interactions. We now describe the full details of our significantly extended studies that include the design, synthesis, molecular modeling, and biological evaluation of a series of inhibitors of SARS-CoV PLpro.\n\nAs shown in Scheme 1, coupling of (R)-(+)-1-(2-naphthyl)ethylamine or (R)-(+)-1-(1naphthyl)ethylamine with benzoic acid derivatives utilizing N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N\u2032ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (HOBT) in the presence of diisopropylethylamine in CH 2 Cl 2 at 23 \u00baC gave the corresponding inhibitor in excellent yield. Inhibitors 8 and 9 were synthesized by general method with N-Boc protected benzoic acid derivative followed by deprotection of the Boc group as shown in Scheme 2. Protection of p-aminobenzoic acid 6 with di-t-butyl dicarbonate in the presence of triethylamine in a mixture (2:1) of dioxane and water at 23 \u00baC for 16 h gave the corresponding t-Bu carbamate 7. 14 A coupling reaction utilizing EDCI and HOBt provided inhibitor 8. Removal of the Boc group with trifluoroacetic acid in CH 2 Cl 2 at 23 \u00baC for 2 h afforded inhibitor 9.\n\nInhibitors 14 and 17 were racemic compounds (Scheme 3). A Friedel-Crafts reaction of naphthalene 10 with propionyl chloride 11 in the presence of aluminum chloride in 1,2dichloroethane at 35 \u00baC for 4 h gave ethyl naphthyl ketone 12. 15 Reductive amination 16 Inhibitor 21 with N-methyl amide was prepared as shown in Scheme 4. Protection of (R)-(+)-1-(1-naphthyl)ethylamine 18 with methyl chloroformate in the presence of potassium carbonate in a mixture (1:1) of dioxane and water at 0 \u00baC for 1 h afforded carbamate 19. Reduction of 19 with lithium aluminum hydride in THF at reflux for 1 h gave methylamine 20. A coupling reaction utilizing general methods provided inhibitor 21. Inhibitor 23 was prepared by coupling of optically active amine 18 with acid 7 as shown.\n\nInhibitor 24 and 25 containing 2-methyl-5-amino derivatives were synthesized as outlined in Scheme 5. Reduction of the nitro group in 5i by catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of 5% Pd-C in a mixture (1:1) of ethyl acetate and methanol at 23 \u00baC for 15 h provided inhibitor 24. Acetylation of 24 with acetic anhydride and triethylamine in CH 2 Cl 2 at 23 \u00baC for 18 h generated inhibitor 25. The synthesis of inhibitor 29 with a gem dimethyl group in the \u03b1-naphthyl side chain was carried out by dimethylation of 1-cyanonaphthalene 26 with methyl lithium in the presence of cerium(III) chloride in tetrahydrofuran at 23 \u00baC for 2 h to provide amine 27. 17 A coupling reaction using the general method described above provided 28, and hydrogenation in the presence of 5% Pd-C in a mixture (1:1) ethyl acetate and methanol at 23 \u00baC for 15 h provided inhibitor 29.\n\nThe synthesis of 32 with 2-methyl-5-iodide and 33 with 2-methyl-5-cyanide substituents on the benzamide moiety is outlined in Scheme 6. Iodination of o-toluic acid 30 with sodium perchlorite and potassium iodide in concentrated sulfuric acid at 25-30 \u00baC for 2 h afforded iodide 31. 18 The coupling reaction following the general method provided inhibitor 32 and cyanation with copper cyanide and sodium cyanide in DMF at 130 \u00baC for 16 h furnished inhibitor 33. Inhibitor 40 was synthesized by esterification of 34 in the presence of thionyl chloride in methanol at reflux for 4 h to provide ester 35. Bromination of 35 with Nbromosuccinimide and benzoyl peroxide in carbon tetrachloride at reflux for 24 h generated bromide 36. 19 Reaction of 36 with sodium hydride and sodium methoxide in methanol at 50 \u00baC for 16 h provided 37. 20 Hydrolysis of 37 with lithium hydroxide monohydrate in a mixture (5:1) of tetrahydrofuran and water at 23 \u00baC for 16 h afforded acid 38. Coupling reaction with general method gave 39 and hydrogenation in the presence of 5% Pd-C in ethyl acetate at 23 \u00baC for 10 h provided inhibitor 40.\n\nInhibitors 47, 49 and 2 have been synthesized as shown in Scheme 7. Reduction of nitro group in 35 by catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of 5% Pd-C in ethyl acetate at 23 \u00baC for 15 h provided amine 41. Reaction of 41 with sodium nitrite, copper cyanide and sodium cyanide in acidic condition at 23 \u00baC for 3 h afforded corresponding benzonitrile 42. 21 Reduction and subsequent N-Boc protection with di-t-butyl dicarbonate and sodium borohydride in the presence of nickel (II) chloride hexahydrate in methanol at 23 \u00baC for 2 h provided N-Boc-benzylamine 43. 22 N-Methylation with methyl iodide and potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide in tetrahydrofuran at 23 \u00baC for 16 h afforded methylamine 44. Hydrolysis of 43 with lithium hydroxide monohydrate in a mixture (9:1) of tetrahydrofuran and water at 23 \u00baC for 16 h generated acid 45. Coupling reaction of 45 with amine 18 using conditions described above provided inhibitor 47. Removal of Boc-group with trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane at 23 \u00baC for 2 h gave inhibitor 2. Inhibitor 49 was prepared from benzylamine 44. Ester hydrolysis, coupling of the resulting acid with amine 18 and subsequent removal of Boc-group as described for 2, afforded inhibitor 49.\n\nAs described previously, screening of a library of 50,080 diverse compounds identified 1 as an inhibitor of PLpro activity. 13 Since 1 is a racemic mix, we synthesized the corresponding chiral compounds to evaluate the stereospecific recognition of these compounds by PLpro. Compound, with the R-configuration, was found to be twice as potent as the racemic compound 1 (R-configuration compound, IC 50 = 8.7 \u03bcM; compound 1, IC 50 = 20.1 \u03bcM). We therefore selected R-configuration compound for further optimization as lead compound.\n\nAs shown in Table 1 , we modified the substituent on the benzamide ring with methyl and methoxy groups. Compounds 5a-5e turned out to be less potent than lead compound. Thus, a methyl group at the ortho position in lead compound displayed the most potent activity (IC 50 = 8.7 \u03bcM). A methoxy group at the ortho position resulted in a 10-fold reduction in potency compared to lead compound. A methoxy group in the meta position (compound 5f, IC 50 = 13.5 \u03bcM) is the most potent analog among the methoxy substituted derivatives.\n\nWe next attempted further modification of the substituent on the benzamide as well as on the naphthyl rings, and the results are summarized in Table 2 . As shown, a 2,6-dimethyl derivative, 5f, led to an increase in the IC 50 value compared to lead compound (compound 5f, IC 50 = 12.1 \u03bcM). Bulky substituents at the ortho and para positions of the benzamide ring and \u03b1-naphthyl position also resulted in increased IC 50 values.\n\nIn an attempt to further improve the potency of PLpro inhibitors, we then examined 1naphthalene derivatives and also explored polar functionalities on the benzamide ring based upon modeling studies. The results are shown in Table 3 . Compound 5h, with an R-1naphthylethylamide derivative, shows improvement in potency compared to lead compound (compound 5h, IC 50 = 2.3 \u03bcM). The importance of an amide NH is demonstrated as the Nmethyl derivative has significantly attenuated potency (compound 21, IC 50 = 22.6 \u03bcM; compound 5h, IC 50 = 2.3 \u03bcM). 5-Amino group resulted in an even more potent inhibitor 24 with an IC 50 value of 0.56 \u03bcM. However, incorporation of a polar acetamide derivative afforded a less potent derivative (compound 25, IC 50 = 2.6 \u03bcM).\n\nTo obtain molecular insights into the ligand-binding site interactions responsible for the inhibitory potency of compound 24, the X-ray structure of PLpro complexed with 24 was determined previously to 2.5\u00c5 resolution. 13, 23 Comparison of the apoenzyme SARS-CoV PLpro structure to the inhibitor 24-complexed structure reveals significant conformational differences between these structures. 23 Based upon this molecular insight, we further modified the substituents on the benzamide ring. Particularly interesting is the fact that the amine group in 24 is positioned at the opening of the cleft where it appears to come within hydrogen bonding distance to the hydroxyl of Tyr269. Furthermore, there are a number of water molecules present (see Figure 2 ) that occupy the pocket accommodating the (R)methyl substituent of 24. This suggested the potential for extending the methyl branch further into the pocket through the addition of polar substituents. As shown in Table 4 , we incorporated a dimethyl group in place of the (R)-methyl substituent, however the corresponding inhibitor showed a reduction in potency for SARS PLpro (compound 29, IC 50 = 11.1 \u03bcM). Based upon the X-ray structure, we then incorporated 5-methylamine substituents on the benzamide ring. The resulting compound 2 showed a slight improvement in inhibitory potency (compound 2, IC 50 = 0.46 \u03bcM) and antiviral activity (EC 50 = 12.5 \u03bcM) as shown in Table 5 . The addition of a methyl group to the amine group of 2, provided compound 49 which showed slightly decreased enzyme activity (IC 50 = 1.3 \u03bcM) but significantly improved antiviral potency (EC 50 = 2.5 \u03bcM). These results illustrate the importance of testing compounds not only for their ability to inhibit the purified protein, but also to assess their effects on cell viability and inhibition of viral replication in a cell-based assay.\n\nTo obtain molecular insights into the active site interactions leading to improved inhibitory potency, we created an energy-minimized model of 2 in the 24-inhibited SARS-CoV PLpro active site ( Figure 2B ). The model reveals that the 5-methylamine substituent of inhibitor 2 may be involved in hydrogen bonding with the side chain of residues Gln270 and Tyr269.\n\nSimilar to the crystal structure conformation of compound 24, compound 2 appears to be anchored in the site by two effective hydrogen bonds made between the carboxamide group and residue Asp165 and Gln 270. The three conserved water molecules found in both the complex crystal structure of compound 24-bound protein and the crystal structure of the apo enzyme are retained for modelling studies and are shown as red dots in the P5 binding pocket (see Figure 2B ). In docking studies, these water molecules are necessary for obtaining the crystal bound orientation of these compounds which positions the naphthyl ring of the inhibitor to be flipped upwards holding the loop (shown in cyan, Figure 2A ). In the absence of these three waters, the naphthyl ring tends to occupy the P5 pocket, shown in green, Figure 2A .\n\nTo better quantitate and understand the contributions of the inhibitor substituents to the inhibitory potency, we also conducted an extensive Quantitative Structural Activity Relationship (QSAR) analysis. QSAR studies are often employed as a standard method to determine valuable information for designing novel and potent inhibitors. An alternative approach to labor-intensive chemical synthesis is to develop a theory that quantitatively relates variations in biological activity to changes in molecular descriptors for each compound. The goal of our computational study was to develop a robust QSAR model that can predict and differentiate inhibition values of this series of inhibitors against SARS-CoV PLpro. Partial least squares (PLS) methodology was used for the 3D-QSAR analyses. The CoMSIA descriptors were used as independent variables and percent inhibition values at 100 \u03bcM were used as dependent variables in PLS regression analyses to derive the models. The predictive value of the models were evaluated by leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation. To assist ligand-based structure design efforts, we used docking in conjugation with 3D-QSAR (CoMSIA) to investigate the SAR of 46 inhibitors with considerable structural diversity and a wide range of bioactivity against the SARS-CoV PLpro.\n\nThe crystal structures of the apo protein (PDB id: 2fe8) 11 and the inhibitor 24-bound form (PDB id: 3e9s) 13 were carefully studied, and it was determined that three water molecules are conserved in the active sites of both the structures; two are buried deep in the P5 pocket and one between residues Lys158 and Glu168. Apart from these three conserved water molecules, two additional water molecules are located at the ridge by the P5 pocket in the inhibitor-bound form of the protein. As previously mentioned, by conducting extensive analyses both with and without water molecules bound to the structures, we determined that retaining the three conserved water molecules made a substantial difference in replicating the crystal structure binding geometry of compound 24 in docking studies. When docking was performed in the absence of water molecules in the P5 pocket, the study suggested that the naphthyl rings prefer to flip downward and probably find lower energy conformations in this pocket as shown in Figure 2A . In the inhibitor 24-bound crystal structure, two of the conserved water molecules hinder placement of the naphthyl rings in the P5 pocket and thereby flip the rings upwards. This position of the naphthyl rings fits nicely in the hydrophobic pocket and forms favorable interactions with the flexible loop residues. The five water molecules mentioned above are clearly shown in Figure 2B and were retained for the docking procedure prior to CoMSIA 24 model generation. In Figure 2B , the superimposition of the naphthyl rings of modeled compound 2 (green) and x-ray structure bound orientation of compound 24 (cyan) is clearly shown as obtained in the presence of the conserved water molecules.\n\nUsing the binding conformation of inhibitor 24 from the crystal structure as a template, 45 other inhibitors were docked. The docked geometry of these 45 inhibitors aligned very well with the binding geometry of compound 24 in the crystal structure. A predictive 3D-QSAR model was derived from the alignment of the docked conformations of the inhibitors as extracted directly from the 3D coordinates of the docked complexes. A successful CoMSIA model was built with a cross-validated q 2 of 0.678 and bootstrap R 2 of 0.984. It is imperative to mention here that without the inclusion of at least the three conserved water molecules, the docking geometry of the inhibitors does not align with the crystal structure (as shown in Figure 2A ). In the absence of these water molecules, the wrong ligand conformation is generated where the naphthyl ring is flipped into the P5 pocket, consequently resulting in an SAR with no correlation.\n\nThe CoMSIA model at six components gave a cross-validated q 2 of 0.678, r 2 of 0.984, F of 302.2 and a mean standard error estimate of 4.72. The high r 2 of 0.984 illustrates that the physicochemical descriptors chosen were appropriate to describe the binding interactions mode of the various inhibitors with the PLpro active site. The plot shown in Figure 3 shows the correlation between the experimental percent inhibition values of 41 compounds and the inhibition percentages predicted by the CoMSIA model. The contour maps generated, shown in Figures 4A-C, were mapped back to the topology of the active site to reveal that electrostatic, hydrophobic, and steric fields were in accordance with the distribution of the binding site residues. These contour maps should prove to be helpful in determining the incorporation of functional groups for the inhibitors that can extensively interact with specific binding pocket residues. We conclude that this robust 3D-QSAR model built using CoMSIA can be used as a reliable guide for future structure-based drug design efforts.\n\nIn summary, a series of novel inhibitors of SARS-CoV PLpro has been designed, synthesized and evaluated in enzyme inhibitory and antiviral assay. Initial lead compound 1 was discovered via high-throughput screening. This racemic compound has shown enzyme IC 50 value of 20 \u03bcM. The stereochemical preference for the R-isomer was established through synthesis and evaluation of optically pure inhibitors, and kinetic studies showed that the optically pure lead inhibitor is a reversible inhibitor of SARS-CoV-PLpro enzyme. In the absence of any structural information, initially our structure-activity-relationship studies and systematic modification guided by molecular modeling studies provided potent inhibitor 24. This inhibitor displayed enzyme inhibitory activity of 560 nM and antiviral EC 50 value of 14.5 \u03bcM in SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells. A protein-ligand X-ray structure of 24bound SARS-CoV PLpro provided detailed molecular interaction in the active site of PLpro enzyme. Based upon the X-ray structural information, our structure-based design led to identification of potent inhibitors 2 and 49. Inhibitor 2 has shown potent enzyme inhibitor activity of 460 nM and antiviral EC 50 value of 12.5 \u03bcM against SARS. Interestingly, the corresponding methylamine derivative 49 (enzyme IC 50 = 1.3 \u03bcM) has shown most potent antiviral activity against SARS (EC 50 = 2.5 \u03bcM). To obtain molecular insight into the binding properties of 2 and its derivative, we have created active model based upon the Xray structure of 24-bound SARS PLpro. It appears that the methylamine functionality is within proximity to hydrogen bond with the side chain residues of Gln270 and Tyr269. We have also carried out computational docking studies and generated predictive 3D-QSAR model for SARS-CoV PLpro. Further design of reversible SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitors is currently underway in our laboratory.\n\nChemistry 1 H-NMR and 13 C-NMR spectra were recorded on Varian Oxford 300 and Bruker Avance 400 spectrometers.

These structures were minimized in Sybyl7.3 by molecular mechanics with the Tripos force field to a gradient of 0.005 kcal/(mol A), after addition of hydrogen atoms to the ligands. The crystal structure co-ordinates of the bound ligand, 24, were used as a reference molecule for docking the other 45 compounds in GOLDv3.2 which allows full ligand flexibility and automatic consideration of cavity bound water molecules. The genetic algorithm parameters were all set to default except the number of the operations were increased to 500000 and the population size was incremented to 500. If the top three conformations generated by the docking software for the ligands did not differ from each other by at least 1.5A, early termination was allowed, ensuring non-redundant ligand conformations. The five water molecules were explicitly defined in the docking configuration file and were integral to the docking procedure and results. The top three conformations were saved for further analysis. The best scoring ligand conformation was determined as the final docked conformation for each of the 46 ligands and was used for the alignment in the proceeding QSAR analysis.\n\nCoMSIA-The final top scoring docked conformations of the 46 molecules were retrieved from the GOLDv3.2 run. Mulliken charges were calculated for these fully optimized structures based on the AM1 method in the Sybyl distribution of MOPAC. The resulting charged 46 molecules were aligned to each other for the CoMSIA analyses to explore the specific contributions of the effect of physicochemical properties on their bioactivities. By virtue of their similar docked conformations in the active site of SARS-PLpro, the overall alignment did not need much manual tuning. Using the QSAR module in Sybyl, a spreadsheet was created for the 46 aligned molecules. Five physicochemical properties namely, steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic fields, and hydrogen bond donor and acceptor were evaluated. Similarity indices were computed using a probe with a charge of +1, radius of 1 \u00c5, a hydrophobicity of +1. The default value of 30 kcal/mol was set as the maximum cut-off for steric and electrostatic energies. With standard options for variable scaling, SAMPLE method, leave-one-out cross validations were performed to determine the optimal principal component number. The cross-validation runs were carried out for 20 groups and the 10 round bootstrap run followed. The final CoMSIA model was obtained with this optimal number of components and non-cross validated conventional correlations. The training set was further tuned to delete five outlier compounds; this improved the model's q 2 value considerably. Hence, the resulting CoMSIA model training set consisted of 41 molecules including compound 24.\n\nPLpro enzyme (residues 1541-1855) was expressed and purified from E. coli according to our previously reported proceedures. 11d IC 50 values for all inhibitors were determined using a 96-wellplate-based assay similar to our previously described methods. 11 The substrate used in the assay was the fluorogeneic peptide Arg-Leu-Arg-Gly-Gly-AMC (RLRGG-AMC) which was purchased from Bachem Bioscience. Reactions were performed in a total volume of 50 \u03bcL which contained the following components: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 5 mM DTT, 50 \u03bcM RLRGG-AMC, 2% DMSO, and varying concentrations of inhibitor (0-200 \u03bcM). Reactions were initiated with the addition of PLpro to produce a final enzyme concentration of 125 nM. Reaction progress was monitored continuously on a Tecan Genios Pro microplate reader (\u03bb excitation = 360 nm; \u03bb emission =460 nm; gain=40). Initial rate data were fit to the equation vi = vo/(1 + [ I ]/IC 50 ) using the Enzyme Kinetics module of SigmaPlot (v. 9.01 Systat Software, Inc.) where vi is the reaction rate in the presence of inhibitor, vo is the reaction rate in the absence of inhibitor, and [ I ] is the inhibitor concentration.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.
