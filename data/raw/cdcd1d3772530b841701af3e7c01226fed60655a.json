{"title": "Distinct Lineage of Vesiculovirus from Big Brown Bats, United States Technical Appendix Materials and Methods Sample collection and viral metagenomic sequencing", "body": "The complete genome of the American bat vesiculovirus (ABVV) was obtained by Sanger dideoxy sequencing of PCR products obtained using combinations of primers designed throughout the genome (Technical Appendix Figures 1 and 2 ) and the 5\uf0a2 and 3\uf0a2 extremities were obtained using Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE). PCR primers were designed from metagenomic contigs using PRIMER3 (5) . PCRs were performed using LA Taq (Clontech) with reagent concentrations according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR reactions were carried out with a \"universal touch-down PCR\" suitable for the melting temperatures of all primers, as follows: 95\u00b0C for 5 min, 45 cycles of [94\u00b0C for 1 min, 58\u00b0C minus 0.2\u00b0C per cycle for 1 min, 72\u00b0C for 1 to 5 min], followed by 72\u00b0C for 10 min. Amplicons were sequenced to their entirety by Sanger sequencing. The 5\uf0a2 and 3\uf0a2 genome extremities were amplified using RACE amplification kits (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and previously described protocols (4) .\n\nTo determine the relationship of ABVV to other rhabdoviruses, a phylogram was created based on the amino acid sequence encoded by the nucleoprotein (N), polymerase (L) gene, as well as the five gene concatenated alignment. The deduced amino acid sequences were aligned using Mafft 5.8 (6) with the E-INS-I alignment strategy and previously described parameters (4, 7) .\n\nBayesian inference trees were constructed using MrBayes (8) . The Markov chain was run for a maximum of 1 million generations, with a stopping rule implemented so that the analysis would halt when the average deviation of the split frequencies was less than 0.01%. Every 50 generations were sampled and the first 25% of mcmc samples were discarded as burn-in. Mid-point rooting was conducted using MEGA (9) . VesiConAF (5\uf0a2KCDGAYAARAGYCAYTCVATGA 3\uf0a2) and VesiConAR (5\uf0a2 TGNGCNACDGTNARDGCATT 3\uf0a2) were used for the first round of PCR. VesiConBF (5\uf0a2 GGNMGRTTYTTYTCHYTDATGTC 3\uf0a2) and VesiConBR (5\uf0a2 TCHGCNGAYTGCATNGTYTCA 3\uf0a2) were used for the second round of PCR with 2.5 \u00b5l of the first round PCR product The LA Taq reaction composition and touch-down PCR was performed as described above."}
