{"title": "Characterization of germline antibody libraries from human umbilical cord blood and selection of monoclonal antibodies to viral envelope glycoproteins: implications for mechanisms of immune evasion and design of vaccine immunogens NIH Public Access Author Manuscript", "body": "Elicitation of potent, broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against HIV-1 by immunization remains a challenge. We had previously hypothesized that HIV-1 may use conserved structures that cannot initiate immune responses because of the existence of \"holes\" in the human germline B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire, i.e., lack of germline antibodies capable of binding those structures [1] . In support of this hypothesis, we showed that germline-like antibodies corresponding most closely to known HIV-1 bnAbs such as b12, 2G12 and 2F5 lack measurable binding to the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) [1] . This observation led to investigation of the maturation pathways of two HIV-1 bnAbs b12 and X5 [2] , whose structures and functions are well known [3, 4] , as well as to the identification and characterization of several human IgM-derived monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) selected from a large phage-displayed na\u00efve human antibody library constructed from 59 healthy donors [5] . These studies demonstrated that germline intermediates corresponding to b12 also fail to bind the Env with high affinity, whereas the X5 putative germline-like predecessor antibody and other IgM-derived mAbs which diverged less from their corresponding germlines have high binding affinity for the Env; however, the latter enhanced or did not potently neutralize infection by HIV-1 primary isolates. Further studies on B cell lineages and maturation pathways of HIV-1 bnAbs may sidestep this impediment to HIV-1 vaccine developments [6] .\n\nAs a part of our studies on the human antibodyome toward understanding initial responses to immunogens [7] , we previously generated large IgM antibody libraries and developed and characterized IgM mAbs against SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), and soluble Hendra virus G protein (sG) [8, 9] . Human umbilical cord blood B lymphocytes that presumably have not been exposed to exogenous antigens have been used as a source of naturally-occurring germline or minimally-mutated pre-immune antibodies [10, 11] . For this reason, cord blood-derived IgM libraries might serve as a relevant source for selecting the closest germline antibodies corresponding to broadly neutralizing mAbs if they exhibit binding to target antigens. The current study addresses the hypothesis that the human cord blood does not contain high-affinity binders to HIV-1, although it has high-affinity antibodies against other human infectious agents such as SARS CoV and henipaviruses.\n\nTo explore the diversity and specificity of cord blood-derived IgM antibodies, antibody libraries were characterized using large-scale Sanger sequencing to assess potential repertoire diversity, from which antibodies capable of binding to the Envs, RBD and sG could be identified. Although large-scale sequencing of a cord-blood derived IgM antibody repertoire revealed relatively high diversity, there was no enrichment observed by sequential panning against the Envs. However, considerable specific enrichments were seen when the libraries were panned against the RBD in which the antibodies produced were very close to their putative germline predecessors. These results suggest that HIV-1 could have evolved to elude strong binding to minimally somatically-diversified human antibodies as an escape mechanism from adaptive immune responses.\n\nCord blood was received from the National Disease Research Interchange (NDRI, Philadelphia, PA), and care was taken not to contaminate the cord blood samples with maternal blood. SARS CoV RBD [12] and human sCD4 were produced in our laboratory. HIV-1 Env gp120 Bal [13] was provided by T. Fouts (Institute of Human Virology, Baltimore; currently at Profectus, Baltimore, MD). Soluble Hendra virus envelope glycoprotein G (sG) [14] and gp140 JRFL were provided by C. Broder (Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD). The gp140 Con-s [15] was provided by B. Haynes and H. Liao (Duke University, Durham, NC). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)conjugated mouse anti-M13 antibody was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).\n\nAs a source for amplification of antibody gene fragments, cDNA was prepared from the cord blood of two babies [16] and libraries were constructed using phagemid pComb3x as previously described [17] .\n\nThe heavy (VH) and light (VL) chain variable domains of antibodies were sequenced using the standard Sanger sequencing method. Resulting sequences were sorted and trimmed to produce independent pools of heavy and light chain sequences, and the latter were further sorted into kappa (V \u03ba ) and lambda (V \u03bb ) light chains by searching their translated sequences for a set of mutually-exclusive motifs. These sequences were analyzed using the program JoinSolver [18] , and those which it found to be the result of productive rearrangement and likely to yield functional products formed the data sets for further analysis. Using the outputs from JoinSolver, germline diversity, the heavy chain complementarity determining region (VH CDR3) lengths, and the number of mutations compared to the closest germline match from the V(D)J families were obtained for each sequence. Translated heavy and light chain variable segment library sequences were aligned using ClustalX2 [19] and trimmed to equivalent lengths within each group: V H codons 3-91, V \u03ba codons 9-88, and V \u03bb codons 3-88. Functional V H , V \u03ba , and V \u03bb translated germline sequences in the NCBI IgBLAST database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/igblast) were similarly treated. Separate identity matrices for each stream were generated using BioEdit [20] and the number of amino acid (AA) changes between each query sequence and its closest germline match, as found by JoinSolver, were determined.\n\nThe combined cord blood libraries were used for selection of antibodies against antigens conjugated to magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-270 epoxy; DYNAL Inc., New Hyde Park, NY) as described previously [21] . Antigen was present in the amounts of 5, 5, 2.5 and 1 \u03bcg for the first, second, third, and fourth rounds of panning, respectively. Specific enrichment was determined by using polyclonal phage-based ELISA (ppELISA). Briefly, ppELISA was performed by using Corning high-binding 96-well plates coated with 1 \u03bcg/ml of antigen and blocked with 3% non-fat dry milk in PBS (MPBS). The microplate wells were inoculated with 50 \u03bcl per well of MPBS containing 10 10 PFU of pooled phage purified from each round of panning for 2 hours at room temperature. Following 4 washes with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), bound phage was detected by adding 50 \u03bcl of 1:5000 diluted HRPconjugated mouse anti-M13 antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) to each well. Following incubation for 1 hour at room temperature, the plates were washed 4 times with PBST and the assay was developed at 37\u00b0C with ABST substrate (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and absorbance monitored at 405 nm. Clones that specifically bound to antigens were identified from the fourth round by using monoclonal phage ELISA (mpELISA) as described [21] .\n\nSoluble antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) of antibodies were expressed, purified, and their binding activity was measured as previously described [22] .\n\nTwo relatively large (6.7 \u00d7 10 8 and 7.8 \u00d7 10 8 members) phage-displayed human IgM Fab libraries (designated ml32 and ml33, respectively) were constructed from 50 ml of cord blood from each of two babies as described in Materials and methods. To estimate the sequence diversity of the libraries, 25 and 22 clones were randomly selected from ml32 and ml33, respectively, and sequenced. No identical sequences of heavy and light chains were found; more than 80% of the clones showed productive V(D)J rearrangements. Of the 25 m132 clones, 14 had V \u03ba light chains (families KV1-4) and 11 had V \u03bb light chains (families LV1-3, LV6-8 and LV10). Their heavy chains were also widely distributed (families HV1-5). Similar gene usage and family distribution were observed with m133. These results indicate that the cord blood libraries could have a high level of sequence diversity and contain antibody gene fragments from most of the families of both heavy and light chains.\n\nTo more accurately estimate the diversity of the cord blood libraries, an additional 2112 clones from ml32 and ml33 were sequenced. Productive, full-length rearranged VH and VL sequences from each library were identified. Similarity between the sequences from the VH and VL repertoires was calculated, and 747 (99.2%) and 792 (99.5%) V H sequences from m132 and m133, respectively, were found to be unique ( Table 1 ). The diversity of VL was significantly lower than that of VH; 70.1% and 88.5% for V \u03bb and V \u03ba of VL domains from m132, and 71.1% and 84.9% for V \u03bb and V\u03ba of VL domains from m133 were identified as unique. When the sequences from both libraries were combined, 1549 (99.3%), 780 (83.5%) and 745 (62.0%) sequences of V H , V \u03ba , and V \u03bb , respectively, were unique. The combined cord blood antibody repertoire was then analyzed for gene usage, VH CDR3 length, and somatic mutations compared to the closest germline counterparts. The heavy chain V (HV) regions were found to derive from all 7 HV germline families (Fig. 1A) , and contained representatives from 45 subfamilies found in the IMGT database [23] . All heavy chain D (HD) and J (HJ) gene families were found but in different proportions ( Fig. 1B and C) . The lengths of VH CDR3 ranged from 6 to 26 amino acid residues and the mode was a VH CDR3 length of 14 (Fig. 1D) . For V \u03ba , the V regions, KVs, were identified from gene families KV1-6 but KV7 was absent (Fig. 1E) ; the J regions, KJs, were distributed among all five gene families, KJ1-5 (Fig. 1F) . For V \u03bb , all the V regions, LVs, were present except for three LV gene families, LV4, LV10 and LV11 (Fig. 1G) ; the J regions, LJs, were mostly distributed in LJ1-3 gene families while LJ4 and LJ5 were absent (Fig. 1H) .\n\nTo determine the level of somatic mutations of the antibodies, each sequence from the combined cord blood repertoire was compared to its closest germline and the number of amino acid (AA) mutations was calculated. Of the HVs, 21.5% were the same as germline sequences; 39.2% of the sequences contained only one AA mutation; the remaining 39.3% had two or more AA mutations, but very few sequences with more than 8 mutations were found ( Fig. 2A) . In contrast, the light chains were significantly less mutated, with 57.6% and 73.0% of the \u039aVs and the LVs, respectively, giving translations identical to germlines. The numbers of mutations occurring in the J regions of heavy and light chains were also calculated. Similarly to what was observed with the variable regions, relatively more mutations were observed in the HJs than in the \u039aJs and LJs (Fig. 2B) . The mutations in D regions were not estimated because of the difficulties in determining the D gene germlines for many antibodies due to the events of recombination involving insertion and deletion. These results suggest that the sequence diversity of the libraries is likely to be high although the light chains appear to be less diverse than the heavy chains, and the libraries exhibit low levels of somatic hypermutations.\n\nPreviously, it was noted that the known bnAbs against HIV-1 were highly divergent from their germline sequences in contrast to bnAbs against SARS CoV and henipaviruses which were less diversified, possessing a limited number of mutations. In addition, it was found that germline-like predecessors of several HIV-1 bnAbs lack measurable binding to HIV-1 Envs [1] . Based on these findings, we hypothesized that there is a scarcity or absence of high affinity binders to HIV-1 Envs in the minimally somatically-hypermutated human cord blood antibody repertoire, whereas high affinity antibodies against other human infectious agents including SARS CoV and henipaviruses can be easily found. To test this hypothesis, the combined cord blood library of ml32 and ml33 was panned against gp140 Con-s , a synthetic Env designed by aligning the consensus Env sequences of group M [15] , and the Hendra virus protein sG in parallel. After four rounds of panning, enrichment and binding specificity of pooled phage were determined by ppELISA. Interestingly, significant and specific enrichment was observed with selection against sG only (Fig. 3A) . In a separate experiment, the mixed library was panned against another Env, gp120 Bal , and simultaneously the RBD. In line with previous observations, no marked enrichment was achieved with panning against gp120 Bal while considerable and specific enrichment was seen when the library was panned against the RBD (Fig. 3B) . These results support the hypothesis and suggest that HIV-1 Envs could have evolved strategies to avoid binding to the germline repertoire by presenting epitopes unsuitable for minimally somaticallydiversified human antibodies to bind with, thereby denying them the chance to bind with high affinity. This strategy may represent a way exploited by the virus to escape from strong immune responses.\n\nTo determine the extent to which antibodies against SARS CoV selected from the cord blood library are mutated, a number of individual clones with high affinity for the SARS CoV RBD were identified by mpELISA as described in Materials and methods. Sequencing of these clones revealed them to be identical. This unique clone, designated m390, contains gene products of HV3-30 and KV2-28 in the heavy and light chain V regions, respectively, (Fig. 4A ). M390 has only 2 AA mutations each in the V regions of both heavy and light chains and no mutations in the D and J regions. The purified soluble m390 Fab bound to SARS CoV RBD with an EC 50 of about 50 nM while no binding to an irrelevant antigen gp120 Bal was observed suggesting the specificity of the binding (Fig. 4B) . Previously, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) specific antibodies with V H Q52/V \u03ba 19-28 gene combination eliciting in a mouse model were found devoid of somatic mutations but showed high binding avidities [24] . These results are in line with our previous findings and provide supporting evidence for our hypothesis that extensive somatic hypermutations could be a unique feature for bnAbs against HIV-1 and perhaps other viruses causing chronic infections.\n\nIn summary, panning of a large phage-displayed minimally somatically-diversified antibody library derived from human cord blood against the HIV-1 Envs did not yield any significant binders. However, considerable specific enrichments were seen with after panning against the SARS CoV RBD and Hendra virus sG, yielding an antibody against the RBD whose sequence is close to its parent germline. As we used the whole Envs in this study, one would expect the binding activity due to highly immunogenic epitopes such as the V3 loop which actually could bind and initiate immune response though it may be capable of diverting immune responses from the conserved epitopes. Therefore, the fact that there is no relatively high affinity binding of Envs might indicate that immune responses may not be so fast or in general are different than in the case of the other viruses. These results provide further evidence supporting and expanding the hypothesis that HIV-1 uses a strategy based on absent or weak binding of its conserved epitopes to germline antibodies for escaping neutralizing immune responses.\n\n\u2022 We characterized human cord blood IgM antibody libraries by large-scale sequencing.\n\n\u2022 Phage Fab library from human cord blood did not yield any binders for the HIV.\n\n\u2022 Our study explained the differential immune responses to the HIV and other viruses.
