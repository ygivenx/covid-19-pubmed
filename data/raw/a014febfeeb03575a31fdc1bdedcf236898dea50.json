If BFA treatment began at 4 or 6 hr after viral inoculation, the with the known redistribution of MG-160 and other Golgi markers within the RER (Doms et al., 1989; Lip- effect of this treatment on infection was similar to the effect observed after continuous BFA treatment (i.e., re-pincott- Schwartz et al., 1989; Johnston et al., 1994) .

Therefore, when cells were infected with MHV-A59 inoculation and continued through the entire infection or 1, 3, or 5 hr after inoculation, there was no significant prior to or at the same time of treatment with BFA, the effect of the drug on the GA was not abolished 16 or effect on the ability of the virus to form syncytia 24 hr by cisternae derived from the intermediate compartment between the ER and the Golgi stacks, thus acquiring two membranes in one step (Sodeik et al., 1993 (Sodeik et al., , 1995 . The second wrapping cisternae in vaccinia virus assembly is derived from the trans Golgi network (Schmelz et al., 1994) . In CMV, ultrastructural as well as biochemical studies suggested that short-term exposure of infected cultures to BFA during the late infectious cycle primarily prevented Golgi-dependent processes, e.g., envelopment of naked cytoplasmic nucleocapsids in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and normal processing of glycoprotein B (Eggers et al., 1992) . In Uukuniemi virus, a member of the bunyaviridae, immunofluorescent staining indicated that G1 glycoprotein expressed alone localized to the GA. G2 expressed alone was associated with the RER (Melin et al., 1995) . Coronavirus MHV M glycoprotein (previously known as E1) is targeted to the GA and contains a retention signal for the GA (Machamer et al., 1990; Swift and Machamer, 1991; Armstrong and Patel, 1991) . Previous reports have shown that the GA undergoes rearrangement (Ho et al., 1990) and fragmentation (Campadelli et al., 1993) in viral infections. The data presented here detail the changes in the morphology of the GA in cells infected by a virus which induces the formation of syncytia. In coronavirus infection, the virus displays Cultures were incubated with virus (\") for 1 hr and exposed to BFA (\u0656) for various periods.

If BFA was introduced after be unique to coronaviruses as it was not associated with or before this stage (4-16 hr), there was no effect on other fusion and syncytia forming viruses such as Sindbis viral replication, assembly, and maturation. These results virus infection (Ho et al., 1990) or herpes simplex virus suggest that the interval of 4-16 hr postinfection is the infection (Campadelli et al., 1993) . Since the aggregation most significant period requiring an intact GA for viral of the fragmented GA in the centers of syncytia has not replication and syncytia formation. This conclusion is been previously reported, we investigated the GA in cells based on infection at an m.o.i. of 1 PFU/cell which may infected with LaCrosse bunyavirus, which is known to be an asynchronous infection.
