{"title": "HCAtk and pyHCA: A Toolkit and Python API for the Hydrophobic Cluster Analysis of Protein Sequences", "body": "The annotation of a protein sequence is very often the first step of many bioinformatics analyses, for 10 instance for studying the function of a gene or the evolution of organisms. Protein domain annotation 11 dominates analyses, describing a protein as a list of blocks corresponding to evolutionary and functional 12 conserved segments. Protein domain families have been extensively compiled through sequence or 13 structure similarity searches and stored in several public databases. These domain databases represent HCA toolkit (HCAtk), and its associated python API pyHCA. The package is easily installable and 23 extend our previous developed tools making use of the Hydrophobic Cluster Analysis (HCA) of protein 24 sequences [6, 8-10, 12, 24] , with new functionalities. The HCA methodology, based on a two-dimensional 25 representation of protein sequences, highlights clusters of hydrophobic amino acids making up globular 26 domains. More on the HCA methodology can be found in the supplementary materials. 27 \n\nSeg-HCA [10] was developed to automatically delineate potential \"foldable\" domains within protein 29 sequences and is the core part of our package. Recently, Piovesan et al. [21] implemented an in-house 30 version of Seg-HCA in FELLS, which allows to nicely visualize different properties of a protein sequence. 31 Our new version of Seg-HCA was rewritten for speed and a score is now computed, describing the general 32 composition in hydrophobic clusters of the delineated foldable domains. This score is compared to an 33 empirical distribution computed over 734 disordered protein sequences from DisProt v7 [20] to produce 34 a p-value. Figure 1A shows the distributions of scores computed using non redundant sequences of The second methodology included in the package is our TREMOLO-HCA software (Traveling through Figure 1 : HCA score and HCA plot example. Panel A, left, shows the normalized HCA score distribution calculated for protein sequences from DisProt v7 (left, orange -disordered sequences) and from PDB (right, violet -globular domains). The HCA p-value assessing the globularity of delineated foldable segment, is computed using the empirical distribution from DisProt sequences. Panel B, right, shows the HCA plots of three BRCT domains from the Pfam family (PF00533). The aligned protein sequences were used as an input and conserved amino acids can be visualized in red (highly conserved) and yellow, in the context of hydrophobic clusters (HC), in order to evaluate the secondary structure conservation, relatively to the HC shapes. originates from the use of a two-dimensional alpha-helical net, connecting hydrophobic amino acids 81 separated by up to three non-hydrophobic amino acids (or a proline) [12] . Hydrophobic clusters de-82 fined in this way (with this hydrophobic alphabet and the connectivity distance associated with the 83 \u03b1-helix) have been shown to match at best regular secondary structures (\u03b1-helices and \u03b2-strands) and 84 to constitute hallmarks of folded domains [8, 30] . Sequence segments delineated by Seg-HCA, which The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/249995 doi: bioRxiv preprint correspond to domains that have the ability to fold, either in an autonomous way or following contact 87 with partners [5, 10] ; these segments are later referred to as HCA domains. The advantage of Seg-HCA 88 for the characterization of the dark proteome is to allow the prediction of these foldable domains from 89 the only information of a single amino acid sequence, without the prior knowledge of homologous sequences. can be considered for evaluating the main propensities of hydrophobic clusters towards RSS [8, 24] .\n\nHCA score 104 The HCA score, used to compute a p-value associated with each HCA domain, is defined as follow. Each 105 residue of an HCA segment is associated with a class regarding the residue type and hydrophobicity. Such 106 a residue is either in an hydrophobic cluster and hydrophobic, in an hydrophobic cluster and hydrophilic, 107 or outside an hydrophobic cluster. A value is attributed to each class and the HCA score is computed as Figure S3 : Disordered regions with low HCA score -example n o 1. The HCA pattern displayed by the disordered region is typical of non globular regions, with very few clusters and many proline (star symbols). The disordered region corresponds to the sequence segment from amino acids 85 to 198 of the human Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1) (Uniprot P46527). Figure S3 corresponds to the C-terminal sequence of the human Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27. 134 p27Kip1 controls eukaryotic cell division through interactions with cyclin-dependent kinases [22] and is 135 known as a flexible protein [13] , whose stability is associated with phosphorylation. The C-terminal region 136 of p27 has a high flexibility, which provides the molecular basis for the sequential signal transduction 137 conduit that regulates its own degradation and cell division [3, 13] ).

Examples of disordered regions with high HCA scores. the TGF-beta receptor [7, 28] . The HCA pattern displayed by the disordered region is similar to patterns 156 observed for foldable regions, suggesting that this small domain is able to fold, at least under particular Figure S5 : Disordered regions with high HCA score -example n o 1. The HCA pattern displayed by this disordered region is similar to patterns observed for foldable regions. Clusters of hydrophobic residues, whose length are typical of stable regular secondary structures, are separated by regions whose lengths are typical of loops. This disordered region corresponds to an internal segment, from amino acids 291 to 352, of the chicken's zinc finger FYVE domain-containing protein 9 (UniProt O95405), without known function.\n\nThe second example concerns a disordered region (amino acids 82 to 134) found in another member protein has a high degree of intrinsic disorder, as revealed by the experimental NMR structure of the full 164 length protein, without truncation of the N-or C-terminal regions [15] . No clear function is currently 165 associated with the N-and C-terminal regions of the protein. As for the previous example, the HCA 166 pattern displayed by the disordered region is similar to patterns observed for foldable regions, suggesting 167 that this small domain is able to fold, at least under particular conditions.

The HCA pattern displayed by this disordered region is similar to pattern of foldable regions. Clusters of several hydrophobic residues can be seen close together. The disordered region, (82-134) corresponds to the C-terminal of human Zinc finger protein 593 (UniProt O00488).\n\nExamples of PDB sequences with high HCA scores.\n\n169 Figures S7 and S8 show two examples of HCA plots for sequences extracted from the PDB. Figure S7 170 corresponds to the HCA plot of the Archeoglobus fulgidus VapC ribonuclease (Uniprot O28590, amino 171 acids 1 to 156) whose 3D structure has been solved X-ray crystallography (PDB entry 1W8I).

The figure shows the HCA plot of the mature mouse interferon beta (Uniprot P01575, amino acids 22 to 181, PDB 179 entry 1WU3 [26] ). The protein is made of one domain (Pfam amino acids 27 to 179 (PF00143)), including 180 5 long \u03b1-helices with 42% of hydrophobic residues. As for Fig. S7 , the protein contains large hydrophobic 181 clusters, typical of regular secondary structures, separated by loops. Examples of PDB sequences with low HCA scores. (Uniprot protein P59595, PDB entry 2OFZ [16] ). This nucleoprotein has RNA binding activity, packaging 186 the positive strand of the human SARS coronavirus RNA genome into a helical ribonucleocapsid [27] .\n\nThe RNA binding activity is mediated by the region encompassing amino acids 45 to 181, such binding 188 activity is usually mediated by a high level of flexibility. The full-length protein is made of one or two Fig. S10 is another example of PDB protein sequence with low HCA score.

The full-length protein is made of 19 domains.\n\nThe sequence starts with a signal peptide motif, followed by pairs of G5 domain/E domain (Pfam key factor for the cooperative folding multidomain protein [14] . Once folded, the two domains form an 207 elongated structure, made of small beta strands which correspond on the HCA plot to small clusters.\n\nThe small \u03b2-strands form triplets-stranded \u03b2-sheets connected by collagen-like triple helical regions. In 209 this particular case, several threonine are found included in \u03b2-beta strand. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.
