Until we know this information about  it also hard to assess how bad this novel coronavirus is going to get.\n\nProvince geographically adjacent to Wuhan, Hubei Province, high-efficiency transport between the two provinces may lead to a rapid spread of COVID-19\n\nin Hunan Province. This report included the hospitalized patients with COVID-19 to assess the transmission and clinical characteristic of two hospitals, which designated as the treatment center for the NCP in Huaihua and Shaoyang cities, Hunan Province, China. These findings could provide value information to better understand such new illness.\n\nIn this study, we recruited confirmed patients with COVID-19 from two hospitals, the First People's Hospital of Huaihua and the Central Hospital of Shaoyang which designated as the treatment center of Huaihua and Shaoyang city, Huanan Province, China from Jan 22, 2020 to Feb 12, 2020 . According to the guidelines of China 7 , patient was confirmed by the positive result from the real-time reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasopharyngeal or throat swab. Suspected infectors that did not confirmed by PCR were excluded. For the study population, imported case was defined as an infector who emigrated from Wuhan (who ever lived in or traveled to Wuhan), the rest of study patients were defined as indigenous cases.\n\nAll rights reserved.

In addition, the history of contacting with animals and eating game meat was also screened. If necessary, we directly communicated with the attending physician, patients or their family members. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics, medication therapy (ie, antiviral therapy, antibacterial therapy, corticosteroid therapy and traditional Chinese medicine therapy), underlying comorbidities, symptoms, sign and chest computed tomographic images were obtained from electronic medical records. Outcomes were followed till Feb 12, 2020.\n\nStandard questionnaire and form were used for contact investigation and data collection. The data were independently reviewed by two trained physicians (Ye Deng and Xin Liao) and checked by another two physicians (Hongqiang Wang and Da Long) respectively. Every one signed Data Authenticity Commitment and stamp official seal.\n\nThe date of onset symptom was defined as the day when the case firstly developed symptoms related to NCP. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was defined according to the Berlin definition 8 . Acute kidney injury was identified by an abrupt decrease in kidney function including changes in serum creatinine (SCr) (\u22650.3mg/dl or 265.5\u03bcmol/L) when they occur within a 48-hour period, other diagnostic items according to evaluation, and management of acute kidney injury: a KDIGO summary 9 .

The causative agent was soon identified as a novel coronavirus on Jan 7, 2020. As the sharply increased number of NCP in Wuhan, China ordered a shutdown of Wuhan city on Jan 23, 2020. Hunan Province, geographically closed to Wuhan, immediately launched a level one emergency response to prevent the infection spreading. The other cities also responded strict control measures in succession. From Jan 22, 2020 to Feb 12, 2020, a total of 104 cases were confirmed in the two centers of Hunan Province, 48 (46.15%) were imported cases and 56 (53.85%) were indigenous cases.\n\nSince Feb 6, 2020, imported case no longer appeared in the two centers (Figure 1 A) .\n\nThe cumulative number of confirmed cases increased smoothly in the two centers (Figure 1 B), newly confirmed cases per day ranged from 0 to 11, a slight increase of newly confirmed cases was observed from Jan 22, 2019 to Feb 4, 2020, and then the number turned to a little decline lasted to Feb 12, 2020 (Figure 1 B) . The stable of the two centers was quite different from the sharply growth of patients in Wuhan in recent month.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Family clusters accounted the most infections of COVID-19 in this study population. Cluster 6 (2 cases) and 14 (7 cases) infected via taking the same public vehicle together. Nosocomial transmission did not happen so far in the two centers.\n\nSix clusters (Table 1, were found in this study. In cluster 5, C89 was infected from his wife C45. With the aim to fast screen the potential infections, their family members took the PCR test. Their son-in-law (C'1) and their grandson (C'2) (C'1 and C'2 not included in this study population) got positive results in another hospital, but till now all of them had never developed any symptoms. In cluster 17, C'3 (not included in this study population) returned Shaoyang city from Wuhan on Jan19, 2020, three relatives of C'3 were identified as COVID-19 infection after several days of closely contacted with C'3. None of them had contacted with the other suspected infectors during those days. Her sister-in-low (C37) was confirmed on Feb 1, 2020, her sister (C44) and mother (C49) were confirmed on Feb 4, 2020. But so far C'3 had never developed any symptoms. Weather C'3 is an asymptomatic infection did not been identified by PCR test, but the same contact history and the similar onset time of her three relatives indicate that C'3 was an asymptomatic COVID-19-carrier. In cluster 19, C'4 (not included in this study population) contacted with her college who traveled from Wuhan, and soon confirmed by PCR positive result.

The median incubation duration was 6 days, ranged from 1 to 32 days; 8 patients got more longer incubation duration (18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24 , 24 and 32 days) that more than 14 days. Median time from onset to confirmation was 6 (rang, 0-17) days. There were 16 (15.38%) patients were identified as severe, the ratio of male vs. female was 11:5 and median age was 53 (rang, 18-81); 9 (8.65%) patients required ICU care, the ratio of male vs. female was 4:5 and median age was 59 (rang, 18-84). Of the 9 ICU patients, 3 received invasive ventilation and 4 received noninvasive ventilations. Some patients presented with organ function damage, including 5 (4.81%) with liver function abnormal, 3 (2.14%) developed with cardiac injury and 2 (1.89%) developed with acute kidney injury.

While the controversy of sharply increased cases and medical shortage in the early and outbreak stage in Wuhan, patients in Wuhan may have limitation to fully reflect the true epidemiological characteristics of this illness.

Only 11 (10.53%) of this study patients were sporadic cases that hardly identified infector source, suggesting that community transmission of COVID-19 is not developed rapidly in the two cities (Huaihua and Shaoyang); this also matches the smooth growth of total confirmed cases. Of note, strict control measures by the local government produced a powerful effect on the slowing spread.\n\nWe are eager to know how infectious the virus is. Except the confirmed cases, whether the asymptomatic COVID-19-carriers has the infectious is unclear. Three cases (C37, C44 and C49) infected from the same person (C'3) who ever traveled to Wuhan. But until now, C'3 did not develop any symptoms. Though we did not take a PCR test to confirm whether C'3 was a virus-carrier, the same contact history and the similar onset time of her three relatives indicate that C'3 was an asymptomatic COVID-19-carrier. Five asymptomatic patients were found in this study, one patients (C'4) who infected three family members (C92, C94 and C102) provide evidence that the asymptomatic transmission risks the spread of COVID-19, which brings more difficult to cut off the epidemic's transmission route. We surveyed eight infected couples, a total of 3 infants were closely lived with their parents, but none of them was infected. Just 3 children were infected from their parents or relatives. These observations further demonstrated that infant and child are not so susceptible as adult, that is consistent with the previous reports 2,3,6,12 . Unlike the other reported populations, no nosocomial transmission was found in the two centers 2 . The safeguard of protective equipment and the strengthen of nosocomial infection control may play key roles in the zero accident of hospital-related infection. All rights reserved.

This is consistent with a recent report of 138 Wuhan patients 2 . This report further provides the evidence that male and female may have the same susceptibility of this illness. This study patients were younger than that of reported patients. It may be related to the patients' job characteristics and social relationship. With the Spring Festival coming, young or middle-aged people are more likely to attend social activity, which results in person-to-person transmission. Common symptoms of onset were similar to the reported patietns [1] [2] [3] . The atypical symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea and runny nose bring us more difficult to diagnose precisely. The incubation duration ranged from 1 to 32 days with the median time of 6 days which was similar to the reported patients 13 . A recent report warned us the incubation duration may extend to 24 days 14 . We also found the incubation duration of 8 patients ranged from 18 to 32 days, indicating that it may exceed 14 days which reported with the initial infections 3 .\n\nPatients who required ICU care just presented 8.65%. With the increased awareness of early discovery and timely treatment, organ function damage was occurred just in few patients, that is quite different from observation of patients in Wuhan patients. The higher rate of discharge (38.46%) and lower mortality (0.96%) of this study population may mainly attribute to the relatively superior treat conditions, including enough healthcare worker and single ward for every patient. In addition, psychological intervention was also performed to patients. Studies suggested that COVID-19 may attacks human's immune system which resulted in cytokine storm 3 .

We still don't know the pathogenic mechanism of COVID-19, so we should take a route test of the CD4 and CD8 counts for better understanding of this illness.\n\nThough no antiviral treatment for COVID-19 infection has been proves to be effective 15, 16 . Antiviral and supportive treatment are the major therapy for NCP. 103 of 104 patients of this study received one or more antiviral drugs, including Lopinavar/ ritonavir, interferon \u03b1 atomization and Abidol. Lopinavar/ ritonavir was proved to be substantial clinical benefit against SARS 17 19, 20 . Evidence suggests corticosteroids did not decrease the mortality of patients with SARS and MERS, but rather delayed the clearance of viral 19, 21 .
