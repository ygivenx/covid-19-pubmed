{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Will the quality of research remain the same during the COVID-19 pandemic? Will the quality of research remain the same during the COVID-19 pandemic?", "body": "Since the beginning of the pandemic of COVID-19, the number of published articles on COVID-19 is increasing in parallel with the number of infected patients (1, 2) . As of 21 March 2020, more than 1,000 articles including the term \u00ab COVID-19 \u00bb were published in PubMed. With this rapid surge in new evidence and the urgency to get this disseminated, cCn we shorten the peer review process but do so without decreasing the quality of research? This is our challenge as editors and reviewers.\n\nUsually, it takes at least 2 weeks of peer review folllowed by another 1 or 2 weeks before the final decision is rendered. However, most manuscripts require a second round of revisions. In the current setting, the time between the initial submission and final acceptance is much lower than usually reported. International guidelines (3) and even some clinical trials using a fast-track process (4) were published in this emergency setting. We may face several issues here. First of all, as reviewers, we could be influenced by the current drama when evaluating a manuscript.\n\nFurthermore, some of us who may be working as front line clinicians, and might be unable tp pay enough attention to every detail. Last, but not least, as physician, we all believe that we need to inform the entire community about the evolution of the pandemic and lessons to be learned from other countries and other centers as soon as possible. Whether these factors would influence the quality of research published in the next few months remain to be seen. On a different note, it appears thatevery journal, every Editor, and every reviewer could potentially accelerate the entire peer review process ; something that would be useful in the long-term. This would speed up the medical research worldwide (if necessary). Let's hope that all published papers on COVID-19 have the same quality than those published before the beginning of this pandemic. Time will tell."}
