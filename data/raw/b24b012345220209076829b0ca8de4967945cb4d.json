{"title": "Programmed Ribosomal Frameshifting in SIV is Induced by a Highly Structured RNA Stem-Loop", "body": "Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), requires a programmed \u22121 translational frameshift between the gag and pol coding regions of the viral mRNA. 1 The \u22121 frameshift allows for stop codon read-through at the end of the gag gene, and continued synthesis of the protein encoded by pol. This results in production of a Gag-Pol polyprotein fusion product, which upon proteolysis in immature virus particles will result in the protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase enzymes, as well as the matrix, capsid and nucleocapsid structural proteins. These structural and enzymatic proteins are found in approximately a 10:1 to 20:1 molar ratio in HIV type 1 (HIV-1), depending on the assay used. 2-8 This specific stoichiometry is required for appropriate packaging and formation of virus particles. [8] [9] [10] In retroviruses, the \u22121 translational frameshift is programmed by two cis-acting RNA elements: a seven nucleotide slippery sequence, and a downstream RNA structure. 11 In SIV, as in HIV-1, 2 the slippery sequence is UUUUUUA, and is universally conserved among all isolates analyzed (Los Alamos National Laboratories HIV Database, http://www.hiv.lanl.gov). In this work, we focus on a subtype of SIV (SIV SMM ) found in sooty mangabys (Cercocebus torquatus atys) and macaques (genus Macaca). This subtype is closely related to HIV type 2 (HIV-2), 12-14 while SIV from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) is more closely related to HIV-1. [12] [13] [14] [15] Two models have been proposed for the SIV SMM downstream RNA secondary structure, a stem-loop, 2 and an H-type pseudoknot 16,17 ( Figure 1 ). The pseudoknot model is based on the fact that seven nucleotides in the loop are complimentary to a downstream sequence; however, due to the high degree of sequence conservation, there is no observable covariance between these sequences that could be used to help validate the pseudoknot model. No structural data exists for the SIV frameshift-inducing RNA.\n\nIn this study, our aims were to: 1) Determine the sequence requirement for frameshifting in SIV SMM ; 2) Determine the structure of the SIV SMM frameshift-inducing RNA; 3) Analyze the thermodynamic properties of the structure, and 4) Compare the SIV SMM structure to HIV-1 18-20 and HIV-2 to determine if any structural conservation exists.\n\nThe sequence requirement for SIV SMM programmed translational frameshifting was investigated using a dual luciferase reporter assay. 21, 22 Briefly, SIV SMM sequences of varying length were cloned between Renilla and firefly luciferase reporter genes. In vitro translation of the frameshift reporter constructs was performed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Frameshift efficiencies were calculated by comparing the experimental and control levels of firefly luciferase activity, after normalizing their Renilla luciferase activities as previously described. 21, 22 Results for all sequences tested showed frameshifting efficiencies from 7 to 12% ( Figure 2 ). These frameshifting frequencies are very similar to those measured for HIV-1 in vitro. 2-8 A 78-nucleotide sequence comprising all viral sequences necessary to form the potential pseudoknot ( Figure 1B) induced frameshifting to a level of 9.1 \u00b1 0.7 % (Figure 2 ). There is no significant difference between this value and the frameshifting frequencies observed for shorter constructs that cannot form a pseudoknot (e.g. 57 nt, 8.8 \u00b1 0.4 %). Sequences of 69, 63, 57, and 51-nucleotides induced frameshifting to 12.2%, 8.3%, 8.8%, and 7.1%, respectively ( Figure 2 ). These values were determined from 10 replicate measurements obtained from the same preparations of RNA and lysate. However, higher variability (+/\u2212 3%) in frameshifting is observed when comparing different preparations of lysate and RNA (data not shown). Regardless of the relatively small differences between the various constructs, the data indicate that pseudoknot formation is not a requirement for programmed translational frameshifting by SIV, since the 63, 57 and 51-nucleotide constructs cannot form pseudoknots but produce frameshifting efficiencies comparable to the 78-nucleotide construct. The increase in frameshift efficiency for the 69-nucleotide sequence may be due to the variability of the assay system, or it may possibly be more optimally folded in the context of the reporter gene.\n\nThe stem-loop and pseudoknot models for the SIV SMM RNA were further investigated by NMR using three RNA constructs: 1. A 57 nucleotide sequence spanning nucleotides 14\u221270 (SIV14\u221270), which includes all nucleotides downstream of the slippery site involved in the proposed pseudoknot ( Figure 1C ). 2. A 54 nucleotide sequence that encompasses nucleotides 17\u221270 (SIV17\u221270) ( Figure 1D ). 3. A 34 nucleotide sequence that spans nucleotides 17\u221250 (SIV17\u221250) that can only form a stem-loop structure ( Figure 1E ). For constructs SIV17\u221270 and SIV17\u221250, the tandem C-G pairs at positions 17 and 18 where inverted to G-C pairs to facilitate transcription. Inversion of these C-G pairs had no affect on the folding of the RNA (vide infra, and Figure 3 ).\n\nThe chemical shifts in the RNA loop and proximal stem are essentially identical for all constructs ( Figure 3 ). In particular, the four contiguous cytidines at the apex of the loop (C32 \u221235), which would be involved in the potential pseudoknot interaction (if present), overlay well. There are no changes in chemical shifts for C33\u221235 and C37 in the various constructs. Nucleotide C32 exhibits very minor chemical shift changes, but these are likely due to differences between sample preparations, since the chemical shifts for this nucleotide vary slightly even between different preparations of the same RNA sequence (data not shown). Other differences in the NMR spectra of the various constructs are solely due to the different lengths and helical sequences of the various constructs. Additionally, 2D NOESY experiments reveal the presence of the same NOEs in the loop for all constructs (data not shown). All of the imino protons and their hydrogen-bond acceptors involved in Watson-Crick base pairing have been assigned for SIV17\u221250 ( Figure 1E) , which cannot form a pseudoknot ( Figure 4 ). The same imino proton chemical shifts are observed for the two longer constructs ( Figure 1C and D), and upon addition of 10 mM magnesium, no new imino peaks indicative of new Watson-Crick base pairs are observed (data not shown). These results indicate that the RNA adopts the same stem-loop structure in all constructs regardless of ionic conditions. Therefore, the in vitro translation data ( Figure 2 ) and the NMR data ( Figure 3 ) suggest that the SIV SMM RNA structure is a stem-loop, and not a pseudoknot.\n\nWe further investigated the structure of the SIV17\u221250 RNA by NMR. Thirteen Watson-Crick base-pairs were confirmed by direct detection of trans-hydrogen-bond scalar couplings by HNN-COSY ( Figure 4) . Eleven of the Watson-Crick base-pairs correspond to the stem, while two additional G-C pairs were observed to form across the 12 nucleotide loop, between nucleotides G31-C37 and C32-G36. These assignments were confirmed by thermodynamic measurements and 1D NMR analysis of constructs with mutations of these loop nucleotides. Two cooperative melting transitions are observed: a lower-temperature transition at 66\u00b0C and a higher-temperature transition at 84\u00b0C ( Figure 5A ). These transitions can be assigned to the loop and stem regions of the molecule, respectively, by reference to experiments conducted on sequences that contain guanosine-to-cytidine mutations in the loop ( Figure 5B ), and also 1D NMR measurements as a function of temperature (data not shown). These data indicate that the stem is very stable, and the loop has a surprising degree of stability for a structure which is penalized 7.1 kcal/mole by mfold secondary structure prediction software. 23 The 66\u00b0C melting transition for the loop is also observed for the longer SIV14\u221270 construct ( Figure  1C and Supplemental data).\n\nThe hydrogen-bonding data ( Figure 4 ) and thermodynamic measurements ( Figure 5 ) provide evidence for a highly structured loop conformation. NOESY data also provide further evidence for an unusually structured loop. A strong intranucleotide H6-H1' NOE and a relatively weak intranucleotide H6-H2' NOE for C35 indicate that the base predominately adopts the syn conformation (Supplemental data). 24 Additionally, cross-strand internucleotide NOEs are observed between A29 and A39 (data not shown).\n\nStructures of the SIV frameshift-inducing stem-loop were calculated using 647 NOE-derived distance restraints, backbone torsion angle restraints for the helical regions, hydrogen-bond restraints derived from scalar couplings, and 28 RDC restraints ( Figure 4 and Table 1 ). The 20 lowest energy structures superimpose over all heavy atoms to an r.m.s.d. of 1.29 \u00c5 ( Figure 6A and Table 1 ). The loop consists of a \"neck\" region ( Figure 6 , red nucleotides), and a \"head\" region ( Figure 6 , green nucleotides). The neck region is comprised of a sheared G-A pair (G28-A39) followed by a cross-strand adenine stack (A29 on A39), with A30 flipped out into the minor groove. The head region is comprised of two G-C pairs across the loop (G31-C37 and C32-G36) which close a compact three cytidine triloop (C33,C34,C35). The 12-nucleotide loop structure is well defined, and converges to an r.m.s.d. of 1.13 \u00c5 ( Figure 6B and Table 1) , though the A-form helical stem is more precisely defined as is usually the case for RNA solution structures ( Figure 6C and Table 1 ).\n\nIn this study, we have shown that the \u22121 translational frameshift in SIV is programmed by a thermodynamically stable RNA stem-loop. Analysis of frameshift efficiencies of various constructs suggests that pseudoknot formation does not play a significant role in translational frameshifting, at least in vitro. Furthermore, we observe that the SIV loop is structured in a manner that precludes pseudoknot formation, since two of the nucleotides that would participate in such a pseudoknot are sequestered within stable Watson-Crick base-pairings across the loop. Hence, the 12 nucleotide loop is reduced to a compact CCC triloop conformation. To the best of our knowledge, the CCC triloop is a novel turn conformation. The triloop conformation consists of a base-stack of C33 on C32, with C34 flipped into the minor groove, and C35 adopting a syn-conformation ( Figure 7A ). The syn conformation of C35 is consistent with the observed intensity of the NOE between its H1' and H6 protons (Supplemental Data). The unique CCC triloop structure may be stabilized by a potential hydrogen-bond between the carboxyl oxygen of C34 and the ribose 2'OH of C37.\n\nThe loop contains a modular structural element, the cross-strand adenine stack upon a sheared G-A pair. NOEs that help define the sheared G-A pair are shown (Supplemental Data). A search of RNA structural motifs using the SCOR 2.0 25 database revealed that G28, A29, A38, and A39 adopt a conformation that is nearly identical to the tandem G-A base-pairs found in D. radiodurans 23S rRNA 26 (PDB code 1NKW). The D. rad. structure (white) and the SIV34 structure (red) overlay with an r.m.s.d. of 1.38 \u00c5 over all carbon atoms ( Figure 7B ). While there is no evidence for base-pairing of A29 and A38 in the SIV34 structure, as is seen between A2331 and G2344 in the 23S rRNA, the sequence identity and structural similarities between the two cross-strand stacking motifs are clear.\n\nWhy doesn't the SIV SMM RNA structure form a pseudoknot? Pseudoknot formation as depicted in the secondary structure model in Figure 1B is precluded by the length of the single-stranded linker region between the helical end and the loop, which is only 8 nucleotides. The SIV SMM stem-loop structure alone is 52 \u00c5 in length, and spans more than a full helical turn. Since the secondary structure in Figure 1B includes an additional lower helix (separated by a C-C mismatch of unknown geometry), it is likely that the 8 nucleotide linker would have to span a distance of > 60 \u00c5, which is physically impossible. The two constructs that we have studied that could potentially form pseudoknots have single stranded linkers that are 10 and 13 nucleotides long ( Figure 1C and D, respectively). These linkers are long enough to span the length of the helical turn. Since a translating ribosome paused at the slippery site would be already engaged with the mRNA approximately 13 nucleotides downstream of the first base in the P site (spanning the RNA from U1 to U13 in Figure 1A ), 27,28 the 4 base-pair helix at the base of the stem would be expected to be at least partially unwound prior to the frameshift event. This condition is mimicked in the SIV14\u221270 and SIV17\u221270 constructs ( Figures 1C and  D ), yet these constructs do not form detectable pseudoknot interactions. Thus, we conclude that the loop structure precludes pseudoknot formation by sequestering its nucleotides within a stable (Tm = 66\u00b0C) structure. Interestingly, a recently developed RNA secondary structure prediction algorithm capable of predicting pseudoknots 29 predicts that the stem-loop structure is more energetically favorable than the pseudoknot fold, and also predicts that the linker is capable of folding into an alternative three base-pair stem-loop structure that is incompatible with pseudoknot formation (data not shown).\n\nA comparison of SIV SMM , HIV-2 and HIV-1 sequences (www.hiv.lanl.gov) revealed that SIV SMM and HIV-2 have nearly identical sequences for the frameshifting element, but they are both substantially different from the HIV-1 sequence ( Figure 8A ). Additionally, when the differences between SIV SMM and HIV-2 are mapped to the SIV secondary structure, the only significant difference is observed as a single cytidine-to-uridine transition in the loop ( Figure  8B ), as all other sequence changes preserve the same base-pairing shown in Figure 1A (data not shown). Modeling and energy minimization of the HIV-2 loop structure from SIV starting structures revealed that the HIV-2 loop can adopt an identical structure, and may be further stabilized by an additional hydrogen-bond between the O4 of U34 and the 2'OH group of C32, as compared to the SIV loop ( Figure 8C ).\n\nMost viral RNAs use pseudoknot structures to promote framehshifting. It has been proposed that pseudoknots promote frameshifting through their unique folding topologies, which may be poor substrates for the ribosomal helicase. 30-34 In addition, both pseudoknots and stable stem-loops are capable of pausing ribosomes at frameshift slippery sites. 35,36 A kinetic pause likely contributes to frameshifting 36-38 ; however, previous studies have found no simple correlation between pausing and frameshifting. 35 HIV-1, SIV and HIV-2 are unique in that they utilize highly stable stem-loops for frameshifting. 2, 7, 19, 20 We hypothesize that the nature of the frameshift site RNA structure is dependent upon the slippery site to which it is coupled.\n\nAll retroviral slippery sites have an XXXYYYZ consensus sequence. 39 Previous data indicate that the UUUUUUA slippery sequence used by HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV is one of the most efficient in promoting programmed \u22121 translational frameshifting, suggesting that it is more \"slippery\" than other XXXYYYZ sequences. 40 HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV may only require a thermodynamically stable stem-loop, rather than a pseudoknot, due to the inherent \"slipperiness\" of the UUUUUUA sequence. For these viruses, the stable stem-loops are sufficient to pause ribosomes and induce the appropriate level of frameshifting. Other viruses, such as the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) 32,41 or infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) 35,36 may require pseudoknot structures to attain the appropriate level of frameshifting because their slippery sequences (AAAAAAC for MMTV and UUUAAAC for IBV) are not as slippery. 42 In these cases, pausing alone may not be sufficient, and pseudoknots may be required because they are stereochemically mismatched substrates for the helicase. 43,44\n\nMilligram quantities of RNA suitable for NMR and UV spectroscopy methods were transcribed in vitro using purified His 6 -tagged T7 RNA polymerase, synthetic DNA oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.), and NTPs (Sigma-Aldrich). The first two base pairs of the SIV17\u221250 sequence were flipped relative to wild-type to optimize transcription yields. RNA was purified by denaturing 15% (SIV17\u221250 RNA) or 8% (SIV17\u221270 and 14\u221270 RNA) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, identified by UV absorbance, and excised from the gel. RNA was recovered by diffusion into 0.3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.0), precipitated with ethanol, purified on a 6 mL DEAE anion exchange column, again precipitated with ethanol, and desalted on a 15 mL G-25 gel filtration column. The purified RNA was lyophilized, resuspended in water, and brought to pH 7.0 by the addition of 1 M NaOH or by buffer exchange into 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). 13 C/ 15 N-labelled RNA samples for NMR were prepared using 13 C/ 15 N-labelled NTPs (Silantes GmbH, M\u00fcnchen, Germany). Fully 13 C/ 15 N-labelled adenosine/uridine and guanosine/cytidine samples were prepared. A shorter RNA construct of 24 nucleotides (SIV24; corresponding to G22 through C45, Figure 1 ) was also prepared using NTPs which were specifically deuterated at all positions except the ribose H1'and H2' and base H6/H8 atoms (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.). Partial alignment of RNA for RDC measurements was achieved by adding 17 mg/mL of Pf1 filamentous bacteriophage (ASLA Ltd., Riga, Latvia) to the 13 C/ 15 N-labelled samples.\n\nPlasmid construction-The sequences investigated here are derived from the most commonly occurring sequence of all SIV SMM RNA isolates analyzed (www.hiv.lanl.gov) and represent the consensus sequence. For each sequence tested, complementary synthetic oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.) with BamH I and Sac I compatible ends were cloned into the p2luc plasmid using the unique BamH I and Sac I sites between the rluc and fluc reporter genes. Oligonucleotidess SIV51 (5'-GATCCTTTTTTAGGCCTTGGTCCATGGGGAAAGAAGCCCCGCAATTTCCCATGG CGAGCT-3'), SIV57 (5'-GATCCTTTTTTAGGCCTTGGTCCATGGGGAAAGAAGCCCCGCAATTTCCCCATG GCTCAAGTGCAGCT-3'), SIV63 (5'-GATCCTTTTTTAGGCCTTGGTCCATGGGGAAAGAAGCCCCGCAATTTCCCCATG GCTCAAGTGCATCAGAGCT-3'), SIV69 (5'-GATCCTTTTTTAGGCCTTGGTCCATGGGGAAAGAAGCCCCGCAATTTCCCCATG GCTCAAGTGCATCAGGGGCTGAGCT-3'), and SIV78 (5'-GATCCTTTTTTAGGCCTTGGTCCATGGGGAAAGAAGCCCCGCAATTTCCCCATG GCTCAAGTGCATCAGGGGCTGATGCCAACGAGCT-3') and their complements were phosphorylated, annealed, and ligated into the p2luc vector to produce the experimental constructs. Positive control sequences and their complements were also cloned into p2luc and have two thymidine residues (bold) in the slippery sequence (underlined) replaced with cytidines and an additional nucleotide inserted immediately before the Sac I complementary sequence (GAGCT). Resultant products were transformed into E. coli competent cells (JM109, Promega). Plasmid DNA was purified from cell cultures (Qiagen) and the sequences of all constructs were verified (University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center).\n\nIn vitro transcription-Purified plasmid DNA was linearized by digestion with Pml I prior to in vitro transcription. RNA (\u223c3 kb) was transcribed using the T7 RiboMAX Express Large Scale RNA Production System (Promega), the DNA template was removed by treatment with RQ1 RNase-free DNase, and the mixture was extracted with phenol:cholorform 5:1 (pH 4.7) and chloroform:isoamyl alcohol 24:1 (Sigma-Aldrich). The aqueous phase was run on a 5 mL P6 gel filtration column (Bio-Rad) to remove small abortive products and unincorporated NTPs. The purified RNA was lyophilized, resuspended in water, analyzed by agarose (1%) gel electrophoresis, and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.\n\nIn vitro translation-RNA samples were translated in vitro using the Flexi Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega). Translation reactions contained 1 \u03bcg of RNA per 10 \u03bcL of reaction mixture, 1\u22122 mM Mg 2+ , 70 mM KCl, and 20 \u03bcM of each amino acid except methionine and leucine (10 \u03bcM each). Reactions were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 90 minutes.\n\nFrameshift efficiency measurements-Luminescence was measured using a Veritas microplate luminometer equipped with dual-injectors (Turner Biosystems). For each sequence length investigated, 10 replicates of the experimental sequence and 5 replicates of the positive control sequence were examined using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Luminescence readings were taken for both reporters 10 sec after their respective substrates were injected into the reaction mixture (2 sec lag time prior to measurement). Ratios of firefly/ Renilla luminescence were calculated for each of the experimental and control sequences, and replicates were averaged. The ratio of averages (experimental/control) was then determined, which corresponds to the frameshift efficiency ( Figure 2 ). Measurement error was propagated through these calculations to yield a final standard error mean (SEM) value for each of the determined frameshift efficiencies (Figure 2 ).\n\nThermal stability studies were conducted on purified RNA constructs using a Cary Model 100 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier heating accessory and temperature probe. All samples contained 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 200 mM KCl, and approximately 2 \u03bcM RNA. Samples were slowly heated from 20\u00b0C to 95\u00b0C at a rate of 1\u00b0C/ min and absorbance data were collected at 260 nm in 1\u00b0C increments. Thermal denaturation was determined to be performed under equilibrium conditions, as evidenced by the fact that no hysteresis was observed and similar data were obtained when samples were slowly cooled from 95\u00b0C to 20\u00b0C. A minimum of three scans were taken for each sample. The data were derivatized, linear baseline corrected, smoothed over a 3\u00b0C window, normalized (with the largest value set to 1), and fit using nonlinear least-square fit to solve for T m and \u0394H as previously described. 45 Data analysis was performed using Prism 4.0 (GraphPad).\n\nAll NMR spectra were obtained on Varian Inova (800 and 900 MHz) and Bruker Avance DMX (500, 600 and 750 MHz) spectrometers at the National Magnetic Resonance Facility at Madison (NMRFAM). Spectrometers were equipped with either a conventional proton, carbon, nitrogen (HCN) room temperature probe or a single z-axis gradient HCN cryogenically cooled probe. Residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) were measured using J-modulated 1 H-13 C CT-HSQC experiments (18 planes) in both isotropic and partially oriented 13 C/ 15 N-labeled RNA samples in 90% H 2 O/10% D 2 O at 308 K. Peak intensities from each plane were fit to yield the 1 J C-H coupling values, and RDCs were calculated as the difference between 1 J C-H values for isotropic and partially aligned samples. 47 PALES software (http://spin.niddk.nih.gov/bax/software/PALES) 48 was used to estimate the values for the axial (D a ) and rhombic (R) components of the alignment tensor from converged, low energy structures calculated using XPLOR-NIH 49 in the absence of RDCs. A subsequent grid search procedure 50 performed around the estimated D a and R was used to optimize the values, using lowest overall energies as a target. Optimal D a /R values were determined to be \u221257/.23 for the stem alignment tensor. RDC values for the loop could not be fit to the same alignment tensor as the stem, and were therefore not used for final structure calculations.\n\nThermal unfolding of the SIV17\u221250 RNA (0.8 mM, 90% H 2 O/10% D 2 O, pH 7.0) was monitored by collecting a series of 1D 1 H spectra at increasing temperature. The temperature was increased from 5 \u00b0C to 80 \u00b0C in 5 \u00b0C increments. All spectra were collected with 32 scans. All data were processed using XwinNMR (Bruker) or NMRPipe 51 software, and assignments were made using Sparky (http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/home/sparky/).\n\nNOE distance restraints were categorized as very strong (1.8\u22122.5 \u00c5), strong (2.0\u22124.0 \u00c5), medium (2.5\u22124.5 \u00c5), or weak (3.0\u22127.0 \u00c5) based on the integrated peak volumes obtained from 2D NOESY spectra (50, 150, 200, 250 , and 300 msec mixing times). Torsion angle restraints (angles: \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b6, \u03b7, \u03bd 1 , \u03bd 2 and \u03c7) for residues in the stem (G17-A27, U40-C50) were constrained to A-form values 52 (\u00b115\u00b0), which were consistent with NOESY, TOCSY, HNN-COSY, and RDC data. Additionally, A-form phosphate backbone restraints for these regions were incorporated as previously described. 53 Torsion angles for residues in the loop (G28-A39) were left unrestrained, with the exception of experimentally validated glycosidic (\u03c7) and sugar pucker angles (\u03bd 1 , \u03bd 2 ). Residues with strong H1'-H2' and H1'-H3' cross-peaks (C33, C34, C35) in 2D 1 H-1 H TOCSY (40 msec mixing time) spectra were restrained to the C2'-endo range (\u03bd 1 : 25 \u00b1 15\u00b0, \u03bd 2 : \u221235 \u00b1 15\u00b0), residues without H1'-H2' cross-peaks (G28,A29,A30,G31,C37,A39) were restrained to the C3'-endo range (\u03bd 1 : \u221225 \u00b1 15\u00b0, \u03bd 2 : 37 \u00b1 15\u00b0), and residues which displayed an intermediate H1'-H2' cross-peak (C32, G36, A38, C50), indicative of an averaging of sugar puckers, were left unrestrained. Analysis of the peak volumes of internucleotide and intranucleotide H1'-H6/H8 and H2'-H6/H8 NOEs in 2D NOESY (50 msec mixing time) revealed that C35 was in the syn range; therefore, \u03c7 was restrained to 30 \u00b1 40\u00b0, as previously observed for a syn-cytidine. 24 All other residues in the loop were determined to be in the anti range, and were loosely restrained relative to their sugar pucker conformation (\u03c7 C3'-endo : \u2212160 \u00b1 30\u00b0, \u03c7 C2'-endo : \u2212125 \u00b1 30\u00b0, all other \u03c7 angles: \u2212140 \u00b1 35\u00b0). Hydrogen-bond distance restraints were used for all base-pairs identified by NOESY and HNN-COSY experiments, and very weak planarity restraints (1 kcal mol \u22121 \u00c5 \u22122 ) were enforced during structure calculations.\n\nAn extended structure generated in CNS 1.1 54 was used to calculate 100 starting structures from random initial velocities using distance (NOE), dihedral, hydrogen bonding, and planarity restraints. Structures were subjected to 60 psec (15 fsec time steps) of restrained molecular dynamics in torsion angle space, 90 psec of slow cooling, and 30 psec (5 fsec time steps) of restrained molecular dynamics in Cartesian coordinate space. These structures were then refined with additional RDC restraints using XPLOR-NIH. 49 Structures were heated to 3000 K and cooled to 100 K (50 K steps) for 28 psec of restrained molecular dynamics in Cartesian coordinate space, followed by 500 steps of energy minimization using the Powell algorithm and simulated annealing.\n\nStructures were accepted based on criteria of lowest overall energy and lack of NOE violations >0.5 \u00c5 and dihedral violations >5\u00b0. Structures were viewed and analyzed using MOLMOL 55 and figures were created using PyMol (http://www.pymol.org). The final structures were used to back-calculate RDC values using PALES, 48 and the r.m.s.d. for observed versus back-calculated RDCs was found to be 1.46 Hz (Table 1) .\n\nModeling of the HIV-2 loop structure was performed using Sybyl 7.3 (Tripos, Inc.). SIV starting structures were modified by replacement of the C34 base with a uracil. Charges were added by the Gasteiger-Huckel method (Tripos), followed by 500 steps of energy minimization using the Powell algorithm and the Tripos force field. Charge addition and energy minimization were also performed on SIV starting structures for comparison. Resulting structures were analyzed using Pymol (http://www.pymol.org), and potential hydrogen-bonds (within 2.0 \u00c5) are displayed (Figure 8 ).\n\nCoordinates for the SIV frameshift-inducing RNA have been deposited into the RCSB Protein Data Bank (accession code 2JTP). NMR chemical shift assignments and 2D NOESY time domain data have been deposited into BioMagResBank (accession code 15417).
