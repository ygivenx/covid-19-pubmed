{"title": "Inhibition of hepatitis B virus (HBV) gene expression and replication by HBx gene silencing in a hydrodynamic injection mouse model with a new clone of HBV genotype B", "body": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes acute and chronic infection in the human liver and subsequently hepatic cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that severely affects human health [1-3]. Although a highly effective vaccine is now available for the prevention of new HBV infections, about 400 million people worldwide have already been chronically infected and suffer from chronic liver injury [4].\n\nAn immunologically well-characterized small animal model for HBV infection remains unavailable due to the strict host specificity of HBV infection, which greatly hampers HBV-related research. The laboratory mouse is genetically and immunologically defined, and a large collection of genetically modified animals exists. However, mice can not be infected with HBV. Several lines of transgenic mice with replication competent HBV genomes have been established and represented to be powerful tools for HBV research [5]. However, HBV replication in the transgenic mice is generated from the integrated HBV sequence harbored in all hepatocytes, which is different from what occurs during a natural infection [5-8]. The presence of HBV genomes in these mouse lines inevitably induces immune tolerance to the HBV antigens. In addition, the capability of production of transgenic mouse model is not readily available in ordinary laboratory conditions. Transplant mouse models were established and used for different studies [9-11]. However, the models are based on immunodeficient mouse strains and difficult to handle in the laboratory.\n\nHydrodynamic injection (HI) of replication-competent HBV DNA into the tail veins of mice can establish HBV replication in the mouse liver [12,13]. In 40% of injected C56BL/6 mice, the persistence of HBV surface antigenemia (HBsAg) was greater than 6 months. HBV persistence is determined by the mouse genetic background and plasmid backbone [12]. The HBV HI mouse model is a highly interesting model for testing vaccination strategies and mechanisms of viral persistence [14-18]. This model may be used to the study replication competence of HBV constructs [15]. Previously, the established HBV HI mouse models were based on HBV genotype A replication-competent clones [12,13]. As HBV genotypes B and C are highly prevalent in Asia and may have distinct virological characteristics that correlate with clinical outcomes in the natural course of infection and antiviral therapy, it is warranted to establish HBV HI mouse models with characterized HBV strains.\n\nPatients with chronic HBV infection are currently treated with interferon alpha (IFN-\u03b1) or nucleotide analogs such as entecavir and tenofovir. However, the current therapies have only a limited success rate and frequent viral recurrence after cessation of therapy, therefore, new antiviral strategies are required [19,20]. RNA interference has been developed as potential therapeutic approaches [21-24]. In previous studies, siRNAs targeting different regions of the HBV genome were used. The HBx gene encodes a small non-structural protein that has diverse functions and is required for HBV efficient replication [25,26]. The HBx mRNA contains the common sequence of the four transcripts of HBV [25,27,28], which makes it a potentially useful target for antiviral therapy.\n\nIn this study, we addressed the question whether a replication competent HBV genotype B clone could replicate transiently and persistently in HI mouse model. Plasmids pSB-HBxi285 (non-viral vector) and pSR-HBxi285 (retroviral vector) that express siRNA targeting the HBx gene were constructed. Using these constructs, we asked how the gene silencing by HBx siRNA of genotype B influences the course of HBV replication and persistence in the HI mouse model.\n\nThe 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 fold over-length HBV genome DNA including nt 1658-3215-1986, nt 1360-3215-1986 and nt 1040-3215-1986 were cloned into the pBluesript II KS (+) vector separately. The construction procedure is shown in Additional file 1: Figure S1A and schematic representation of the 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 fold HBV genome are shown in Additional file 1: Figure S1B. The plasmids were analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion with PstI and SacI. PstI and SacI restriction digestion of pBS-HBV1.1B, pBS-HBV1.2B and pBS-HBV1.3B resulted in the appearance of additional bands of 3.5, 3.8 and 4.2 kb in addition to the pBluescript II KS (+) vector, respectively (Additional file 2: Figure S2). Consistently, PstI restriction digestion of pBS-HBV1.1B, pBS-HBV1.2B and pBS-HBV1.3B confirmed that these vectors have the sizes of 6.5, 6.8 and 7.2 kb, respectively (Additional file 2: Figure S2). The HBV 1.3 fold over length genome DNA was amplified and sub-cloned into the NotI site of the pAAV-MCS vector (Agilent technologies, La Jolla, USA). The construction procedure of pAAV-HBV1.3B is shown in Additional file 1: Figure S1C. The plasmid pAAV-HBV1.3B was identified by NotI restriction digestion and an additional band of 4.16 kb (data not shown).\n\nTo investigate the functionality of pBS-HBV1.1B, pBS-HBV1.2B and pBS-HBV1.3B in hepatoma cells, the plasmids were transfected into Huh-7 cells. At 48 h post-transfection, the culture supernatants of the transfected cells were harvested and subjected to HBsAg and HBeAg detection. As shown in Figure 1A, the HBsAg and HBeAg levels in the culture supernatant of pBS-HBV1.3B transfected Huh-7 cells were significantly higher than those with the of pBS-HBV1.1B and pBS-HBV1.2B plasmids (p < 0.01).\n\nTo further compare the replication competence of pBS-HBV1.1B, pBS-HBV1.2B and pBS-HBV1.3Bin vivo, BALB/c mice were subjected to HI with these plasmids. Each group contained 10 mice. At 7 dpi, mouse serum samples were collected for HBV DNA quantification. The liver tissue was collected for immunohistochemical staining of HBcAg. Figure 1B showed that HI with pBS-HBV1.3B resulted in a significantly higher HBV DNA level in mouse serum samples compared with HI with pBS-HBV1.1B and pBS-HBV1.2B (p < 0.01). Immunostaining of HBcAg demonstrated that HBcAg positive hepatocytes could be detected in the mouse liver after HI with each of the three plasmids but absent in the control mice. Moreover, the HBcAg positive hepatocytes were most abundant in the mouse liver of pBS-HBV1.3B transfected mice (Figure 1C).\n\nIt is reported that HBV persistence after HI in mice depends on the host genetic background and plasmid backbone [12].\n\nFirstly, the 1.3 fold over-length HBV genome was cloned into pAAV vector to generate pAAV-HBV1.3B. HI with pAAV-HBV1.3B was performed in C57BL/6 mice to examine whether this HBV isolate of genotype B is able to establish persistent replication in vivo. In parallel, pAAV-HBV1.2 described by Huang et al. (2006) was used as a reference. pAAV-HBV1.3B group included 14 mice and pAAV-HBV1.2 group included 9 mice. The serum HBV DNA levels in C57BL/6 mice with pAAV-HBV1.3B were determined at the indicated time points up to week 48 and were higher than those in mice with pAAV-HBV1.2 (Figure 2A).\n\nThe liver tissue was collected from C57BL/6 mice injected with pAAV-HBV1.3B at 70, 168 and 252 dpi or pAAV-HBV1.2 at 70 dpi, 168 dpi and 340 dpi. HBV DNA was extracted from the liver tissue samples and assayed for HBV DNA by Southern blot analysis. Bands corresponding to the expected size of the input HBV plasmids and HBV replication intermediates including relaxed circular (RC) and single-stranded (SS) HBV DNAs could be detected in the liver of HBsAg-positive C57BL/6 mice hydrodynamically injected with pAAV-HBV1.3B or pAAV-HBV1.2 (Figure 2B). HBV replication intermediates were at a higher level in mice injected with pAAV-HBV1.2 than in those with pAAV-HBV1.3B. Intrahepatic HBV DNA levels also detected by real-time PCR and the results were consistent with the Southern-blot results (Figure 2C). Immunohistochemical staining of the liver sections for HBcAg revealed that both cytoplasmic and nucleic HBcAg were detected in the liver of HBsAg-positive mice hydrodynamically injected with pAAV-HBV1.3B or pAAV-HBV1.2 (Figure 2D). In contrast, no HBcAg positive cell was present in the liver of the control mice and HBsAg-negative mice. All results obtained in this experiment indicate that HBV genotype B construct was replication competent in the mouse liver.\n\nTo investigate whether the vector backbone and the host genetic background also influence persistence of the HBV isolate of genotype B, 10 \u03bcg of the pBS-HBV1.3B or pAAV-HBV1.3B plasmids were injected hydrodynamically into the tail veins of male C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice. Each group included 5 mice. After HI, the mice were regularly bled and the temporal changes in HBsAg, HBeAg, HBcAb, HBsAb and HBV DNA levels were monitored. In BALB/c mice injected with pBS-HBV1.3B, the HBsAg level increased in the first three days but dropped quickly afterward and all mice became negative at 1 wpi. However, the HBsAg level in BALB/c mice injected with pAAV-HBV1.3B declined slowly with time and 75% of the mice were HBsAg positive at day 10 dpi. HBsAg became undetectable in all mice at 4 wpi (Figure 3A). In contrast to BALB/c mice, the HBsAg level decreased much more slowly after injection of the same plasmids in C57BL/6 mice. 50% of C57BL/6 mice injected with pBS-HBV1.3B were HBsAg-positive at 1 wpi and all mice became negative at 2 wpi. Moreover, 75% of C57BL/6 mice injected with pAAV-HBV1.3B were still HBsAg-positive at 2 wpi. HBsAg remained detectable in 50% of the mice after 10 weeks (Figure 3A). These results confirmed that the host genetic background as well as the vector backbone influenced HBV persistence.\n\nIn addition, we also compared the kinetics of viremia between pAAV-HBV1.3B and pAAV-HBV1.2 in the HI C56BL/6 mouse model. The serum HBV DNA level in pAAV-HBV1.3B injected mice was higher than that in pAAV-HBV1.2 injected mice (Figure 2A). However, the C57BL/6 mice received pAAV-HBV1.3B had a lower positive rate of HBsAg compared with that received pAAV-HBV1.2. 20% of the mice are HBsAg positive at week 24 after HI with pAAV-HBV1.3B, which was only half of that in mice injected with pAAV-HBV1.2 (Figure 3B).\n\nNone of the C57BL/6 mice injected with pAAV-HBV1.2 produced HBsAb after 28 dpi, although all of them produced HBcAb after the day 7 (Table 1). However, 3 of 14 C57BL/6 mice received pAAV-HBV1.3B produced HBsAb after the 28 dpi. Moreover, the raise of HBsAb in pAAV-HBV1.3B injected mice was faster than that in pAAV-HBV1.2. As shown in Table 1, for those mice producing HBsAb, they were HBsAg negative. All mice developed HBcAb after 7 dpi. Thus, different replication competent HBV genomes in the AAV vector may differ in their ability to establish the persistent replication in mice.\n\nHuang et al. (2006) confirmed that the tolerance toward HBV surface antigen in this model was due to an insufficient cellular immunity against hepatitis B core antigen. To confirm this result, HBV-specific CTL responses against full length HBcAg peptide were detected at 3dpi and 10 dpi after HI by ELISPOT assay of IFN-\u03b3 producing cells. At 3 dpi we almost could not detect any significant levels of HBcAg specific IFN\u03b3-producing cells in the splenocytes (Figure 4A). However, the average number of IFN\u03b3 secreting cells was 463 and 653 in 1\u00d7 106 splenocytes in pAAV-HBV1.2 and pAAV-HBV1.3B injected mice at 10dpi, respectively (Figure 4B). There is no significant difference between those two groups (p > 0.05). The result indicates that HBcAg-specific immune response may play a key role in clearing HBV infection at early stage in the HI mouse model.\n\nTo apply RNAi in vivo, the vector based expression of siRNAs was explored in the HI mouse model. For these purpose, two different vectors pSuper.retro (pSR) and pSuper.basic (pSB) were tested. Two different target sequences in the HBV x gene were selected and cloned into the vectors (see Material and Methods).\n\nThe antiviral effect of pSR-HBxi314 and pSR-HBxi285 was investigated in vitro. As shown in Figure 5A, the HBsAg and HBeAg levels decreased by 80.2% and 78.7% when pAAV-HBV1.3B and pSR-HBxi285 were co-transfected into Huh-7 cells, respectively. However, when pAAV-HBV1.3B and pSR-HBxi314 were co-transfected into Huh-7 cells, the HBsAg and HBeAg levels were only inhibited by 10.5% and 30.3%, respectively. Different concentrations of pSR-HBxi285 were used to test whether the antiviral effect was dose-dependent. Figure 5B and C showed that pSR-HBxi285 inhibited HBsAg and HBeAg expression as well as HBV DNA in a concentration-dependent manner in the range of 0.1\u20130.5 \u03bcg. The 0.5 \u03bcg dose of pSR-HBxi285 was most effective for the reduction of HBsAg, HBeAg and HBV DNA in transient transfection.\n\nTo compare the antiviral effects of pSB-HBxi285 and pSR-HBxi285 in vitro, pAAV-HBV1.3B and different concentrations of pSB-HBxi285 or pSR-HBxi285 were co-transfected into Huh-7 cells. Figure 5D shows that pSB-HBxi285 and pSR-HBxi285 inhibited HBsAg and HBeAg in a dose-dependent manner. However, there was no significant difference in their antiviral effect (P > 0.05).\n\nBased on the previous experiments, 10 \u03bcg of pAAV-HBV1.3B and 10 \u03bcg pSB-HBxi285 or pSR-HBxi285 were co-injected into C57BL/6 mice to determine the antiviral effect of HBxi285 in vivo. Each group contained 10 mice. Initially, HBsAg levels in mice were significantly reduced by HI in the presence of pSB-HBxi285 or pSR-HBxi285 plasmids at 1 dpi (p < 0.05), compared with the control groups receiving empty vectors (Figure 6A). However, the HBsAg levels in pSB-HBxi285 treated mice quickly increased during the follow up and reached the levels of the control at 14 dpi. In contrast, the HBsAg levels in pSR-HBxi285 treated mice were inhibited to a significantly lower degree before the 28 dpi compared with the control groups (p < 0.05). HBsAg became detectable in some mice at 42 dpi. It is worthy to note that the majority (7 of 10) of the mice received pSR-HBxi285 were HBsAg negative during the whole experimental period (Table 2). HBV DNA concentrations in mouse sera were determined and were well correlated with HBsAg levels (Figure 6B). Figure 6C shows that the HBsAg positive rate in pSB-HBxi285 or pSR-HBxi285 treated mice was significantly decreased in comparison to the controls at 1 dpi. Thereafter, the positive rate of HBsAg in pSB-HBxi285 treated mice increased gradually and showed no significant difference in comparison to the control at 7 dpi. The positive rate of HBsAg in pSR-HBxi285 treated mice remained at a lower level (18.2-27.3%) than other groups until the 4th week post injection (wpi) but showed similar levels to the other groups in the 5th wpi. Consistently, immunostaining of HBcAg in the liver section of mice after HI demonstrated that the co-application of pSR-HBxi285 or pBS-HBxi285 abolished HBcAg expression in the mouse liver at 3 dpi (Figure 6D). However, HBcAg may become detectable in the mouse liver which received pSR-HBxi285 similar to those of control mice 4 weeks after HI. The results indicated that HBxi285 could significantly inhibit the HBsAg production and HBV replication. However the vector pSR-HBxi285 was more efficient in reducing HBsAg and HBV DNA levels than that of pSB-HBxi285.\n\nIn the present study, an HBV genotype B HI mouse model was established. After HI with pAAV-HBV1.3B, HBsAg and HBV DNA were detected in peripheral blood. Southern blot and immunohistochemical staining analysis revealed that HBV DNA and HBcAg were detected in the liver tissue of HBsAg-positive mice. Different hepatitis B virus genotypes may have distinct virologic characteristics, which may correlate with antiviral curative effects and clinical outcome [29,30]. The majority of HBV infections are distributed in the Asia-Pacific region. In these regions, patients are mainly infected with genotypes B and C. Previous studies showed that in China and Taiwan, approximately 90% of patients under thirty-five years old who are infected with HBV would develop HCC and most of them carried an HBV genotype B infection [30,31]. Now, we have a system at hand to examine the replication of HBV genotype B clone in the mouse models.\n\nIn present study, we investigated the effect of the HBV genome length on HBV replication competence to find the optimal structure of replication competent HBV genotype B clone. Three clones with 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 fold over length HBV genotype B genomic DNA were constructed based on the pBluescript II KS (+) vector. Schematic representation of the 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 fold HBV genome used in this study are shown in Additional file 1: Figure S1B. The plasmid with 1.3 fold genomes containing a complete extra copy of the entire EnhI, Enh II and HBx gene as shown in Additional file 1: Figure S1B which is a suitable HBV construct for transfection and HI experiments. When the cloned plasmids were transfected into Huh-7 cells or hydrodynamically injected into BALB/c mice, pBS-HBV1.3B demonstrated significantly high-level replication and gene expression in comparison to pBS-HBV1.1B and pBS-HBV1.2B (Figure 1). Increasing the length of the 1.3 fold over length HBV genome did not further improve the replication competence. Nevertheless, the replication competence declined and could not reach the original level of HBV in nature infection state when the length is less than 1.2 fold of the HBV genome. Durantel et al. and other groups used 1.1 fold over length HBV genome for studies on drug resistant HBV isolates [32,33]. However, they added strong foreign promoters to enhance the HBV transcription and replication. In conclusion, the 1.3 fold HBV genome length containing a complete extra copy of the entire EnhI, EnhII and HBx gene as described in the present study could be regarded as an optimal length for HBV replication constructs with the authentic HBV sequence, independent on a foreign promoter.\n\nTo establish a persistent replication HBV mouse model with the HBV genotype B clone, 1.3 fold over length HBV genotype B genome was sub-cloned into the pAAV-MCS vector and introduced into C57BL/6 mice by HI. Huang et al. (2006) found that the AAV vector contributed to the persistence of HBV in mouse liver. Therefore, we used a similar vector pAAV-MCS, to construct HBV genotype B replicational clone in this study. This vector also has the ITR (inverted terminal repeats) structure, which was considered as a key factor for its stable existence in vivo by integration or non-integration way. Because the vector does not express other proteins except that encoded by the target genes, the vector backbone has no direct effect on the immune system.\n\nAfter HI, the mice presented higher HBV DNA level, but a lower positive rate for HBsAg in serum compared with pAAV-HBV1.2 injected mice [12]. Apparently, HBV replication is not strictly correlated with HBsAg production, as known for patients [34-38]. The result indicated that the model is more robust when pAAV-HBV1.2 genotype A is used as compared with pAAV-HBV1.3B. Huang et al. (2006) confirmed that the tolerance toward HBV surface antigen in this model was due to an insufficient cellular immunity against hepatitis B core antigen, as documented in humans. We repeated some experiments and obtained the same results (Figure 4A and B). The difference in plasmid backbones between both clones needs to be investigated further.\n\nThe antigenemia and production of HBV particles were highly reproducible in the persistent HBV replication mouse model based on HI making this model appropriate for the evaluation of the efficacy of anti-viral drugs. Therefore, we further investigated the anti-viral effect of vector-expressed HBx siRNA in this model. Co-application of the HBx siRNA expression plasmids treatment of these mice induced a significant inhibition of HBV replication and expression. When pAAV-HBV1.3B was co-injected into the tail veins of C57BL/6 mice with either pSB-HBxi285 or pSR-HBxi285, HBV expression and replication were efficiently inhibited. There are two methods commonly used to silence target genes. Chemical synthesized siRNAs have a good specificity and are commonly used on cells by transfection. However, such siRNAs, if not chemically modified, are instable and eliminated rapidly in vitro and in vivo. The production of siRNAs, particularly with specific chemical modifications, is very expensive. Another approach is to use siRNA transcription vectors. The disadvantages to use such as retroviral vectors are, for example, the lower transfection efficiency and slow action compared with chemical synthesized siRNA. However, the vector-based approach has some advantages regarding the stability and costs. It is important to prolong the expression of siRNAs to maintain the inhibition of HBV. Moreover, when the pSuper.Retro vector was transfected into a packaging cell line such as 293 T cell line, it could produce retroviral supernatants and obtain a higher rate of stable cell integration (The Manual of pSuper RNAi system, OligoEngine, Washington, USA) [39,40].\n\nHI of naked plasmid DNA is a simple yet effective in vivo gene delivery method into hepatocytes. The early reports suggested that a large portion of hepatocytes could be reached with this technique [41-44]. Therefore, it could be a useful method to test the efficacy of RNAi based antiviral therapies in the mouse model. Certainly, there is still a challenge how to transfer the knowledge gained in this system into human situation.\n\nIn this study, non-viral (pSuper.Basic) and retroviral vectors (pSuper.Retro) were used to construct shRNA (small hairpin RNA) expression plasmids [45] targeting the HBx gene of HBV. The pSuper.Retro vector contains the H1 promoter which is a RNA polymerase III like promoter and can transcript shRNA steadily, and showed persistent inhibitory effect in vitro[46,47]. The pSuper.Retro vector includes 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 terminal LTR structure of murine stem cell virus. The pSuper.Retro vectors can be transfected into a packaging cell line to produce retroviral supernatants and obtain a higher rate of stable cell integration. In addition, this vector contains an incomplete packaging signal and could not produce recombinant retroviruses (The Manual of pSuper RNAi system, OligoEngine, Washington, USA). pSuper.Basic is a pUC origin vector (The Manual of pSuper RNAi system, OligoEngine, Washington, USA) and used to compare the stability with pSuper.Retro in vivo. The difference of both vectors in the gene silencing effects is likely due to their stability in vivo. HBx protein plays an important role in HBV replication and HBV induced HCC [26,48]. Therefore, HBx became a good target gene for gene silencing in recent years. Importantly, as all HBV RNA transcripts share the same sequence in the HBx due to its unique transcription mechanism, siRNAs targeting the HBx region actually knock down all HBV RNAs, as shown in the previous studies [28,49,50].\n\nThe result showed that the siRNA targeting the region nt 285\u2013303 of the HBx coding region has a stronger antiviral effect than that targeting the region nt 314\u2013332. It is known that siRNA-specific features such as low G/C content, a bias towards low internal stability at the sense strand 3\u2032-terminus, lack of inverted repeats, and sense strand base preference, interaction with the cellular machinery called RISC and so on are likely to contribute to efficient RNAi process. The relative influence of these parameters is not fully understood and now under investigation by many groups [51-56]. When pAAV-HBV1.3B and pSB-HBxi285 or pSR-HBxi285 was co-injected into the tail veins of C57BL/6 mice, HBV expression and replication could be significantly inhibited by the first week. Thereafter, the antiviral effect declined in the pSB-HBxi285 treated mice, whereas the antiviral effect of pSR-HBxi285 was maintained for at least 4 weeks. These results indicated that the retroviral vector based HBx siRNA expression plasmid could much more effectively inhibit HBV expression and replication than the non-viral vector based HBx siRNA expression plasmids. Among the mice which received pSR-HBxi285, HBV replication was completely suppressed in the majority of mice, as no HBsAg was detectable for the whole experimental period of 16 weeks. However, HBV gene expression and replication may resume in some mice despite an initial delay, indicating that transient suppression of HBV replication by HBx siRNA may also fail to clear HBV completely in some individuals. It is worth to mention that the change of serum HBsAg and HBV DNA in the mice after the application with HBx siRNAs occurred with different kinetics. The reason may be the different requirement of HBsAg translation and HBV DNA replication. It is well established that only a small fraction of HBsAg is required for virion production [57]. In the patients with chronic HBV infection, HBV DNA loads do not correlated with HBsAg [58]. Our results suggest that measures to prolong the antiviral effect of the siRNA should be investigated in future studies.\n\nIn summary, our established HBV genotype B HI mouse model is reliable and could be applied for studies on genetic and antiviral research of chronic HBV infection. The retroviral vector based HBx siRNA expression plasmids could efficiently inhibit HBV expression and replication, suggesting that an siRNA-based treatment strategy may be an additional therapeutic option for future clinical use in patients with chronic HBV infection.\n\nThe plasmid pAAV-HBV1.2 which contains an 1.2 fold over-length HBV genotype A genome (nt 1400-3182-1987) [12], was kindly provided by Prof. Pei-Jer Chen. The plasmid pUC-HBV containing a full length genotype B HBV genome (1820-3215-1824 nt, GenBank accession number: AY220698.1) was kindly provided by Prof. Jiming Zhang (Fudan University, China). The construction procedure of pBS-HBV1.1B, pBS-HBV1.2B and pBS-HBV1.3B is shown in Additional file 1: Figure S1A. First, the large fragments of the genotype B HBV DNA nt 1658-3215-247, nt 1360-3215-247 and nt 1040-3215-247 were amplified by PCR with primers hbv1.1LF (tagged with PstI site) and hbvLR (tagged with XbaI site), hbv1.2LF (tagged with PstI site) and hbvLR, hbv1.3LF (tagged with PstI site) and hbvLR, rsepectively. Those three fragments were inserted into the pBluescript II KS (+) (Invitrogen, Camarillo, USA) vector digested with PstI and XbaI. The small fragment of HBV DNA nt 247\u20131986 was amplified using primers hbvSF (tagged with XbaI site) and hbvSR (tagged with SacI site), and was inserted into the the pBluescript II KS (+) vector digested with XbaI and SacI. The resulting plasmids including nt 1658-3215-1986, nt 1360-3215-1986 and nt 1040-3215-1986 of HBV genome were named as pBS-HBV1.1B, pBS-HBV1.2B and pBS-HBV1.3B, respectively. Schematic representation of the 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 fold HBV genome are shown in Additional file 1: Figure S1B. All primers used to amplify HBV fragments are listed in Table 3. All DNA fragments in the final transfer vectors were amplified with Pyrobest DNA polymerase (TAKARA, Dalian, China) and cloned into the commonly used, commercially available pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, USA) for PCR cloning and sequencing. The correctness of the sequences of cloned DNA fragments were confirmed by sequencing. To establish HI mouse model with a high positive rate of HBsAg, we cloned the 1.3 fold HBV genome into the vector including the backbone of adeno-associated virus, similar to the described procedure [12]. The HBV 1.3 fold over length genome DNA was amplified from pGEM-HBV1.3B with primers hbv1.3 F (tagged with NotI) and hbv1.3R (tagged with NotI), and sub-cloned into the NotI site of the pAAV-MCS vector (Agilent technologies, La Jolla, USA). The resulting plasmid was designated as pAAV-HBV1.3B. The construction procedure of pAAV-HBV1.3B is shown in Additional file 1: Figure S1C.\n\nHuh-7 cells (Human hepatocarcinoma cell line) were maintained in 1640 medium supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum, 100 \u03bcg/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin. Cells were seeded in 24-well plates at approximately 60% confluence. After 24 h, cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Camarillo, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. For pBS-HBV1.1B, pBS-HBV1.2B and pBS-HBV1.3B, 0.8 \u03bcg of plasmid DNA and 2 \u03bcl of lipofectamine 2000 were placed in each well of a 24-well plate. The efficiency of our transfection procedure was verified and controlled by transfection of a GFP expressing vector, as described previously [59].\n\nTo prove the antiviral effect of HBx siRNA, 0.5 \u03bcg of pAAV-HBV1.3B and 0.5 \u03bcg of pSR-HBxi314 or pSR-HBxi285 were co-transfected into Huh-7 cells. The dose dependent antiviral effect of pSR-HBxi285 was tested by co-transfection of 0.5 \u03bcg pAAV-HBV1.3B with 0, 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 \u03bcg of pSR-HBxi285 into Huh-7 cells. To compare the antiviral effects of pSB-HBxi285 and pSR-HBxi285, 0.5 \u03bcg pAAV-HBV1.3B combined with 0, 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 \u03bcg of pSB-HBxi285 or pSR-HBxi285 were co-transfected into Huh-7 cells in parallel. All cell transfection experiments were performed three times.\n\nThe replication competence of the overlength HBV genomes in vivo was tested by HI with pBS-HBV1.1B, pBS-HBV1.2B or pBS-HBV1.3B plasmids in BALB/c mice (female, 6\u20138 weeks old, from the breeding colonies of the experimental animal center in Hubei Province, China), with 10 mice per group. C57BL/6 mice (male, 6\u20138 weeks old, from the breeding colonies of the experimental animal center in Shanghai, China), were subjected to HI with pAAV-HBV1.3B or pAAV-HBV1.2 to test the ability of these plasmids to establish persistent HBV replication. pAAV-HBV1.3B group included 14 mice and pAAV-HBV1.2 group included 9 mice. To investigate the factors affecting HBV persistent in the mouse liver, we injected pBS-HBV1.3B or pAAV-HBV1.3B into BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice separately, with 5 mice per group. HI experiments were carried out as described previously [17], 10 \u03bcg of HBV plasmid DNA was injected into the tail veins of mice in a volume of 0.9% NaCl, equivalent to 8% of the mouse body weight. The total volume was delivered within 5\u20138 s. For HBx siRNA experiments, 10 \u03bcg pAAV-HBV1.3B and 10 \u03bcg pSB-HBxi285, pSR-HBxi285 or control plasmids were co-injected into the C57BL/6 mice. Each group included 10 mice. The control mice were injected only with the volume of 0.9% NaCl, equivalent to 8% of the mouse body weight.\n\nCulture supernatants of pBS-HBV1.1B, pBS-HBV1.2B or pBS-HBV1.3B transfected Huh-7 cells were harvested at 48 h post-transfection. Mouse sera were collected at the 1d (day), 3d, 7d, 10d, 2w (week), 3w, 4w, 5w, 6w, 7w, 8w, 9w, 10w\u2026 after HI. The analysis of HBsAg (ng/ml), HBeAg (NCU/ml, National Clinical Unit/ml), HBsAb (mIU/ml, Milli-International Units) and HBcAb (S/Co, Sample/Cutoff value) levels were determined by using the Architect system and CMIA kits (Abbott Laboratories, Wiesbaden-Delkenheim, DE) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nHBV DNA was extracted from 40 \u03bcl of mouse serum samples. The protocol was described previously [17]: 40 \u03bcl of samples were treated with 10 \u03bcg DNase I for 16 h at 37\u00b0C. 100 \u03bcl of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 20 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl and 0.5%SDS) containing 50 \u03bcg proteinase K were added. After incubation at 65\u00b0C for 3 h, viral DNA was isolated by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The DNA pellet was rinsed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in 10 \u03bcl of ddH2O.\n\nThe quantification of HBV DNA was performed by using a routine real time PCR procedure, described previously [34,60-64]. The HBV copy numbers were determined by SYBR Green Real time PCR Master Mix (commercially available assay kit, TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan). Melt curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis were used to verify the specificity of the real-time PCR. The following primers were used: forward primer: 5\u2032-CTG CAT CCT GCT GCT ATG-3\u2032 (nt 408\u2013425), reverse primer: 5\u2032-CAC TGA ACA AAT GGC AC-3\u2032 (nt 685\u2013701) according to the reference sequence with Genbank accession number (AY220698.1). Serum containing a known concentration of HBV DNA was used as a positive control.\n\nThe liver tissue was taken from the mice receiving HI with pBS-HBV1.1B, pBS-HBV1.2B or pBS-HBV1.3B at 7 day post injection (dpi) and the mice receiving HI with pAAV-HBV1.3B at 70 dpi, 168 dpi and 252 dpi or pAAV-HBV1.2 at 70 dpi, 168 dpi and 340 dpi, which was then used for immunohistochemical staining of the HBcAg in hepatocytes. The liver tissue of the mice received 0.9% NaCl was used as negative control. Liver tissue was collected from the mice and embedded in paraffin. Intrahepatic HBcAg was visualized by immunohistochemical staining with rabbit anti-HBc (Dako) of the liver tissue sections. The liver tissue sections were also stained with hematoxylin.\n\nTotal DNA from the pAAV-HBV1.3B and HBx siRNA expression plasmids co-transfected Huh-7 cells and the liver tissue of mice was isolated using commercial kits (OMEGA, Norcross, USA). The isolated HBV DNA was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis followed by denaturation and Southern blot analysis. All DNA samples were treated with RNase before gel electrophoresis. HBV DNA was detected by hybridization with a digoxigenin (DIG) (Roche, Lewes, UK)-labeled full length HBV probe. The hybridization signals were visualized on x-ray film using an alkaline phosphatase-anti-DIG-Fab conjugate in the presence of the chemiluminescence substrate CDP-Star (Roche).\n\nELISPOT assay was carried out using the mouse IFN-\u03b3 precoated ELISPOT Kit (Dakewe, Shenzhen, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plates were preincubated with the coating antibody (anti-IFN-\u03b3 monoclonal antibody) at 4\u00b0C overnight and blocked for 2 hr at 37\u00b0C. Mouse splenocytes at the density of 1 \u00d7 106 cells per well were added to wells in triplicate with final concentration of 0.5 \u03bcg/ml full length HBcAg peptide (ProSpec, Ness-Ziona, Israel) separately and incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 for 24 hr. 1 \u03bcg/ml of ConA (Sigma, St. Louis, USA) was used as positive control. Thereafter, cells were removed. Wells were washed ten times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-T) and incubated with 100 ml of biotinylated anti-IFN\u03b3 antibody for 1 hr. The plates were washed again with PBS-T and incubated with 50 ml HRP-strepto-avidin solution at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr. Spot-forming cells were counted and analyzed with an ELISPOT plate reader (BioReader 4000, Biosys, Germany). Results were presented as spot-forming cells per 1 \u00d7 106 cells.\n\nTwo pairs of DNA sequences targeting the nt 285\u2013303 and nt 314\u2013332 of the HBx coding region of HBV (genotype B, adw) were designed in accordance with the protocols for the siRNA expression vectors pSuper.Basic and pSuper.Retro (OligoEngine, Washington, USA), and the two RNAi design server (http://www.ambion.com/techlib/misc/siRNA_tools.html and http://www.dharmacon.com/DesignCenter). The DNA sequences were as follows: HBxi314F, 5\u2032-GAT CCC CCG ACC GAC CTT GAG GCA TAT TCA AGA GAT ATG CCT CAA GGT CGG TCG TTT TTA-3\u2032, HBxi314R, 5\u2032-AGC TTA AAA ACG ACC GAC CTT GAG GCA TAT CTC TTG AAT ATG CCT CAA GGT CGG TCG GGG-3\u2032; HBxi285F, 5\u2032-GAT CCC C GA GGA CTC TTG GAC TTT CAT TCA AGA GAT GAA AGT CCA AGA GTC CTC TTT T TA-3\u2032, HBxi285R, 5\u2032-AGC TTA AAA AGA GGA CTC TTG GAC TTT CAT CTC TTG AAT GAA AGT CCA AGA GTC CTC GGG-3\u2032, the HBx iRNA control sequences were: HBxiconF, 5\u2032-GAT CCC CGC ACC TAT AAC AAC GGT AGT TCA AGA GAC TAC CGT TGT ATA GGT GCT TTT TA-3\u2032, HBxiconR, 5\u2032-AGC TTA AAA AGC ACC TAT AAC AAC GGT AGT CTC TTG AAC TAC CGT TGT TAT AGG TGC GGG-3\u2032 (the sequences targeting HBx gene are shown in italics). The single strand DNA products were purchased from Invitrogen (Shanghai, China).\n\nThe above complementary sequences were phosphorylated and ligated into BglII and HindIII digested pSuper.Basic or pSuper.Retro vector. The resulting plasmids were named as pSB-HBxi314, pSB-HBxi285, pSB-HBxicon, pSR-HBxi314, pSR-HBxi285 and pSR-HBxicon. The clones were sequenced to confirm the correctness of the sequences.\n\nThe data were evaluated by Student\u2019s t-test or one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test. The statistical significance of the data was considered at p < 0.05.\n\nThe animal experiments were carried out in concordance with the guidelines established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Huazhong University of Science and Technique and the Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College. The mice used in this study were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine.\n\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n\nLL, JS, DY, and ML conceived and designed the experiments.
