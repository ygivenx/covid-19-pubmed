{"title": "Journal of Infection Corona Virus Disease 2019, a growing threat to children?", "body": "3.Early isolation should be performed to protect underlying diseases children. Compared to infected adults, the condition of infected children is significantly milder, with faster recovery, shorter virus shedding time and better prognosis. By far, only 2 critical cases have been reported, of which one was a child of 7 months old with congenital heart disease. The other patient was 13 months old with bilateral hydronephrosis and calculus of left kidney. Both cases progressed rapidly to respiratory failure after onset, requiring support of invasive mechanical ventilation. It demonstrates that children with underlying diseases are tended to progress to severe and critical cases, so we should pay high attention to such group and strengthen supervision for them. In the laboratory tests part, blood cell count and procalcitonin (PCT) were basically normal, C-reactive protein (CRP) was normal or slightly increased. Some cases need two or even three tests to be confirmed. It suggests that although positive viral nucleic acid test is the \"gold standard\", clinical \"false negative\" children are also the potential source of infection. For clinical suspected cases, a continuous and repeated samples collection are need to improve the accuracy 5 .\n\nAnother urgent issue we are facing is how to perform antiviral therapy. Up to date, no effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug has been successfully confirmed in clinic neonates were also negative on day 5 and 10 of their hospitalization. No evidence of mother-to-child vertical transmission was found. Finally, powerful broad-spectrum antibiotics and corticosteroids should be avoided 9 . In the period of COVID-19 outbreak, the incidence and fatality rate of severe cases in Hubei province, especially 5 in Wuhan city, are significantly higher than that in other regions of China, which may be influenced by improper use of antibiotics and corticosteroids. Premature use and excessive coverage of antibiotics and corticosteroids may result in secondary infection 10 .\n\nIn summary, SARS-CoV-2 is generally susceptible to people of all ages. Most of the infections in children are familial clusters with mild clinical symptoms. Early isolation should be performed to protect children with underlying diseases, and it is necessary to enhance the protection during delivery and isolate the newborns immediately after delivery. Newborn with COVID-19. A newborn whose mother was infected with COVID-19 showed low fever but no dyspnea after birth. The throat swab viral nucleic acid was positive 24 hours later, and the lung CT showed viral pneumonia."}
