The clinical spectrum in COVID-19 patients presents diversely [4] [5] .\n\nViral shedding is a critical indicator for prognosis, and prolonged viral shedding always predicts a poor outcome [5] [6] . In this report, however, we describe a special case of a family cluster with a mild type of COVID-19. In one family .

Nevertheless, this case shows a mild infectivity and a better status comparing with most cases. Fortunately, treatment with plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients efficiently cleared out the virus infection. This report describes the detailed epidemiologic and clinical information of this special patient and his close contacts, which might provide rationale for reasonable treatment, risk-stratification, strategy of community healthcare management and policymaking for hierarchical medication.\n\nAll cases were diagnosed and classified according to the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis Program (5th edition) 7 \n\nCommission of China. Clinical manifestations consist of four categories, mild, moderate, severe and critical. The mild clinical symptoms were mild with no pulmonary inflammation on imaging or without symptoms of respiratory infections. The moderate is the overwhelming majority, showing symptoms of respiratory infections such as fever, cough, and sputum, and pulmonary inflammation on imaging; when symptoms of dyspnea appear, including any of the following: shortness of breath, RR \u2265 30bpm, blood oxygen saturation \u2264 93% (at rest), PaO 2 / FiO 2 \u2264 300 mmHg, or pulmonary inflammation that progresses significantly within 24 to 48 hours> 50%, it was classified as severe;\n\n.

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the hospital. All subjects signed informed consent forms at admission to hospital. 130 patients including the discharged and dead in our hospital between January 14, 2020 and March 19, 2020 were investigated and their clinical indexes were used as references of a hospitalized patient (Case 1), who would be introduced in detail in this study. There were 96 cases of moderate type, 19 cases of severe type and 15 cases of critically ill type (all died). Another patient Case 2, the close relative of Case 1, was also followed. All patients were confirmed by viral detections using quantitative RT-PCR 8 , which ruled out infection by other respiratory viruses such as influenza virus A, influenza virus B, coxsackie virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus and enterovirus by the same time.\n\nIn this study, the basic information, clinical symptoms, complete blood count, coagulation profile, and serum biochemical test (including renal and liver function, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and electrolytes) and disease outcome of all included patients were collected.

Noteworthily, the levels of blood lymphocytes, interleukin-6 and procalcitonin have been recognized as indicators for disease severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients by us and others 5, 9 . These three indexes were all normal and stable in this patient ( Fig. 2A-C) , while the viral load persisted in a high level as the severe or critical ill patients did (Fig. 2D) .\n\nNotably, IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 showed positive on Feb. 20 and Mar. 14, while IgM antibody tests remained negative.\n\nGiven the prolonged infection, this patient received plasma infusion treatment.\n\nThe plasma was collected from recovered patients with COVID-19.

The patient got fever in 4 hours after infusion, with the body temperature up to 38.9 \u00b0C , which we considered as a blood transfusion reaction. As expected, the body temperature became normal the next day. Notably, the viral tests of SARS-CoV-2 via oropharyngeal swabs on Mar. 16 and Mar. 17 turned into negative.\n\nEpidemiological survey revealed that besides his relative, the patient closely contacted with another five people before admission. One contact also got fever for a short term but the test for SARS-CoV-2 showed negative. The other four contacts without any symptoms were also negative in SARS-CoV-2 tests.\n\nCase 2 is a close relative of Case 1. This elderly woman visited our hospital on The patient was prescribed anti-viral medicines and Chinese traditional medicines. However, the fever was not absolutely controlled after receiving these treatments for 3 days. Notably, this patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with long term use of methylprednisolone (4 mg, oral, 1 qd) ( Table   1 and Fig. 1B ).\n\nAfter admission, physical examination showed a body temperature of 36.0 \u00b0C , .

(Table 1 and Fig. 1B) .\n\nIt was reported that the median duration of viral shedding was 20.0 days from disease onset and the longest was 37 days 5 . There were no significant differences between severe patients (19 days) and critical patients (24 days) 5 .\n\nIn our report, the duration of viral shedding from illness onset in Case 1 has persisted for 49 days, which has been the longest in ever reported in symptomatic patients. Previous studies indicated the level and duration of viral shedding is a critical indicator to access the risk of transmission and to guide the isolation of patients as well as predicting the prognosis [5] [6] . In viral infection, prolonged viral shedding was associated with inferior outcome 6 . Interestingly, .

Given that Case 2 has a history of long-term use of glucocorticoids, which is the high-risk factor for severe infection and progression, overall, the severity of Case 2 was much optimistic than average status in her age group, since it was reported elder people infected SARS-CoV-2 have much worse prognosis 10 .\n\nFurthermore, though his another relative also got fever at the time of visit, the viral test was negative, indicating the virus may be promptly cleared off or this contact was not infected. While genetic mutations may be considered to contribute to the mild signs in this family cluster case, one more important thing is other four close contacts who do not have any blood relationship with Case 1 even were not infected after contact. Recently, one study found ABO blood group is a new risk factor for severity of patients with COVID-19. People with blood group A have a higher risk and the patients with blood group O have a lower risk than other groups 11 . However, the blood group of Case 1 is group AB .

These clues together indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Case 1 and Case 2 may be a mild subtype, both to young and to old people. Tang et al. investigated the molecular divergence of SARS-CoV-2, showing the virus evolved into two major types (namely L subtype and S subtype) 12 . Of which L type is more prevalent consisting of approximately 70% in all patients and S type is the ancestral version. In addition, L type has a high frequency in patients and presents more likely to spread comparing with S type 12 . Currently, few studies focused on identifying the clinical features between these two subtypes, thus we cannot assure that Case 1-associated virus belongs to S type, mutated L type or a new subtype.\n\nSince the onset time of Case 1 revealed this mild subtype already exists at the early stage of outbreak when L type occupied dominant position, we cannot exclude an original new subtype that was not identified. Because this potential subtype shows a quite low toxicity, weak transmissibility and people infected with this type showed an affirmative outcome, it is worthy for us to further analyze the mRNA sequence of the virus type isolated from Case 1, which will help us to distinguish potential mild patients. It is beneficial to distribute the limited medical sources and to guide the community healthcare management in the context of pandemic .\n\nDue to the limited capacity of nucleic acid assays, identifying the reliable indicators to distinguish the severity of patients in early stage is helpful to .

The status of lymphocytes and duration of viral shedding are two most common indicators in predicting prognosis of COVID-19 patients. However, it is still unclear which one of them is more reliable and more efficient. In the present study, IgG antibody can be detected in Case 1 from Feb. 20, indicating Case 1 can initiate immune responses to viral infection. However, the mRNA level of virus in Case 1 showed a similar trend to that of death cases. Taken together, these findings indicated that immune indicators could be more sensitive and reliable than viral shedding in reflecting the overall status of patients and predicting the prognosis. Actually, a recent study found that recruitment of T cells and the presence of IgG and IgM antibodies can be found before the resolution of symptoms in COVID-19 patients 13 . Therefore, we strongly suggest that immune indicators, especially the level of lymphocytes, could be a better prognostic indicator than duration of viral shedding, especially for patients in early stage.\n\nWe next would like to find any other signs that may also be potential prognostic factors besides the level of lymphocytes in early stage of illness. It was reported that the median duration of fever in COVID-19 patients was about 12.0 days 5 . Obviously, the duration of fever in these two cases was shorter than this average duration, indicating both Case 1 and Case 2 can get fever at the initial onset and can be controlled quickly. It is well known that fever can inhibit the viral replication and save response time for immune cells.\n\n.

These findings indicated the immune system in these two cases worked well which can be stimulated by the infection of virus 13 . Thus, we speculate rapidly controlled fever could be one of reasonable candidates to predict severity of patients in early stage. Together, the combination of the status of fever and level of lymphocytes may become an efficient indicator for early predication of prognosis in patients with COVID-19.\n\nPlasma infusion treatment is a new therapeutic method for patients with COVID-19 and the efficiency is still needed to be investigated. In this case, the prolonged infection in Case 1 can be rapidly eliminated after infusion, implying this method might be a potent treatment for patients with COVID-19. However, the long-term outcomes and complications should be further investigated.\n\nAlthough evidences collected from these two cases indicate a better prognosis, patients with long duration of viral shedding in mild type are likely to be neglected in crowd and may persist infecting surroundings and cause a new outbreak. The viral tests of Case 1 once changed into negative on illness days 47. However, it reversed into positive on illness days 49 (Fig. 1A) . It is likely that the virus and the host got a dynamic balance. The viral load and the indicators of immune cells both maintained stable (Fig. 2) . Although the viral duplication was suppressed, immune cells cannot clear out the virus. The Case 1 may tend to be a chronic infected case without infusion treatment, the .

We wondered how many patients involved in this situation. One important question is whether and how long this kind of patients keeps infective. The other important question is whether the \"chronic infected patients\" will infect through new route of transmission, such as sexual transmission. Moreover, due to the high mutation rate of retrovirus, we should keep close eyes on the status of this kind of patients and the infective ability.\n\nWe reported the clinical features of a special family cluster case, of which one member has the longest duration of viral shedding in current reports.\n\nBesides to the long duration, several points should also be concerned. Firstly, the virus infecting this family cluster case appeared low toxicity and low transmissibility. However, it also showed a prolonged infective ability and was hardly to be eliminated in body. This virus type may exist in human bodies for a long time and may be a risk to contribute to periodic outbreak in future considering the high mutation in COVID-19. Secondly, a rapidly controlled fever with normal level of immune cells may be a good predictor to identify patients with superior outcomes in early stage. This conclusion is needed to be validated in carefully designed clinical studies. Thirdly, plasma infusion could be an efficient therapy for patients with COVID-19. Last, long term health status and the infective ability of these people are needed to be followed up due to prolonged infection.
