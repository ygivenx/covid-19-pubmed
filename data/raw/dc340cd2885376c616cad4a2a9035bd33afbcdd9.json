{"title": "Diminazene enhances stability of atherosclerotic plaques in ApoE-deficient mice", "body": "Vulnerable plaque, characterized by the presence of intense inflammation and a lipid-rich necrotic core covered by a thin fibrous cap, have a higher propensity to rupture and lead to subsequent thrombotic occlusion. Indeed, it is well recognized that the risk of thrombosis in atherosclerosis largely depends on plaque composition [1, 2] .\n\nLocal shear stress forces have been documented as a biomechanical factor which modulates atherogenesis and plaque composition [3] [4] [5] . For instance, it has been shown that local low shear stress (LSS) may induce plaque formation and a vulnerable composition [5] . Several molecular pathways are involved in the shear-stress inducing plaque vulnerability process; however, such mechanisms are poorly known.\n\nThe renin-angiotensin system (RAS), a major regulator of cardiovascular function, is highly involved in the genesis and progression of atherosclerosis [6] [7] [8] . Moreover, this system seems to actively influence the composition of atherosclerotic plaques. Angiotensin (Ang) II, the main effector of RAS, contributes to atherosclerosis development by increasing vascular permeability, inflammatory cell infiltration and LDL oxidation and uptake [9] [10] [11] . Moreover, Ang II may increase plaque vulnerability by modulating macrophage trapping, increasing reactive oxygen species production and weakening the fibrous cap by activation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) [10, 12, 13] .\n\nContrarily to Ang II, emerging data indicates that Ang-(1-7), another effector of RAS, has atheroprotective actions [14] [15] [16] . It has been shown that Ang-(1-7) infusion promotes a reduction in plaque size and improves vascular endothelial function in hypercholesterolemic mice [17] . Moreover, long-term treatment with Ang-(1-7) enhances atherosclerotic plaque stability by increasing intraplaque collagen content, decreasing MMP-9 expression and reducing neutrophil and macrophage infiltration [18] . 4 Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a key regulator of Ang II and Ang-(1-7) levels.\n\nThis enzyme breaks-down Ang II, by cleaving the C-terminal phenylalanine and, consequently, forms Ang-(1-7); therefore, ACE2 reduces Ang II and favors Ang-(1-7) actions [19] . ACE2 enzyme is expressed in animal models [20] and human [21] atherosclerotic plaques, playing a protective role in atherosclerosis [14] . Indeed, ACE2 overexpression attenuates the progression of atherosclerotic lesions and increases plaque stability [22] .\n\nContrarily, ACE2 deficiency in low-density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr -/-) or apolipoprotein E (ApoE -/-)-deficient mice worsen atherogenesis [23] [24] [25] . Based on these observations, ACE2\n\nhas being suggested as a potential target for the treatment of atherosclerosis.\n\nIn the present study, an investigation on the effects of diminazene (a recently developed pharmacological ACE2 activator [26, 27] , in a mouse model of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque was performed.\n\nThe atherosclerotic plaques were induced within the right carotid artery of ApoE -/mice by modifying the local pattern of shear stress [5] . ApoE -/mice with a C57BL/6J background (n=40) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Les Oncins, France). Animals at 15-20 weeks received western-type diet consisting of 15% (wt/wt) cocoa butter and 0.25% (wt/wt) cholesterol (Diet W; abDiets) for the entire 11 week experimental period. After 2 weeks of adaptation to the western-type diet, specific patterns of shear stress were applied to the right carotid artery by the surgical placement of a shear stress modifier device called \"cast\". The cast consists of 2 longitudinal halves of a cylinder with a cone-shaped lumen, which imposes a fixed geometry on the vessel wall. Such geometry produces vortices downstream, therefore exposing the artery wall to oscillatory shear stress (OSS) in the downstream region and a low 5 shear stress (LSS) in the region upstream of the blood flow [5, 28] . Such distinct patterns of shear stress induce atherosclerotic plaques with different composition. LSS-induced plaques present features of vulnerable plaques, whereas OSS-induced plaques display a more stable phenotype [5, 18, 28, 29] .\n\nThe cast was implanted as previously described [18, 29] . Briefly, the animals were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation, and the anterior cervical triangles were accessed by a sagittal anterior neck incision. The right carotid artery was carefully detached from connecting tissue and, sequentially, the cast halves were placed around and fixed with silk suture. After closing the wounds, the animals were allowed to recover. The last 3 weeks prior to euthanasia (from week 8 to 11), mice were randomly assigned to receive either vehicle or diminazene [15 mg/Kg per day] subcutaneously. After 9 weeks after of cast implantation (total of 11 weeks feeding with western diet), the mice were anesthetized (ketamine 100 mg/Kg, xylazine 10 mg/Kg) and blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture.\n\nImmediately following cardiac puncture, the animals were perfused with PBS and the carotid artery aortic roots removed and frozen in cryoembedding medium for histological analysis.\n\nThe entire aortas were dissected from the ascending portion until the bifurcation of the iliac arteries and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hours for atherosclerotic lesion analyses.\n\nThis animal study was approved by local ethics committee and Swiss Regulatory Authorities \n\nAfter sacrifice, the aortic tree were cleaned and stripped of fat on the adventitia and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hours. Later, aortas were carefully opened longitudinally and 6 pinned with small needles on a petri dish coated with silicon to expose the area of definable lesion covering the luminal surface. Oil Red O staining was performed as previously described [30] . The images were captured and the lesions were quantitated by calculating the percentage of the total surface area using Image J software. Quantifications were performed using the MetaMorph software. Data were calculated as ratios of stained area on total lesion area.\n\nIntraplaque collagen content was assessed as described elsewhere [18] . Briefly, 7 \u00b5m transversal sections of carotid plaque (LSS and OSS regions) and aortic sinus were rinsed with water and incubated with 0.1% Sirius red (Sigma Chemical Co, St Louis, MO) in saturated picric acid for 90 min. Sequentially, sections were rinsed twice with 5% acetic acid in water for 10 seconds, then immersed in absolute ethanol three times before clearing in xylene twice and cover-slipping. The sections were photographed using identical exposure settings under normal light microscopy. Intraplaque total collagen content was quantified by MetaMorph software. Data were calculated as percentages of stained area on total lesion area.\n\nCarotid (LSS and OSS regions) and aortic sinus plaques were serially cut in 7 \u00b5m transversal sections and stained as previously described \n\nBlood samples were collected by cardiac puncture and remained at room temperature for 20 minutes. The serum was sequentially obtained by centrifugation (2500 rpm for 10 minutes). The assay was performed as described in the instruction manual. The concentrations were expressed as mmol/L. Serum cytokine levels (IFN-\u03b3, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, MCP-1, TNF-\u03b1, VEGF) were determined by using bead based multiplex suspension array kits with Luminex technology on a BioPlex (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The assay was performed following manufacturing instructions and concentrations were expressed as pg/mL.\n\nUnpaired t test was used for all comparisons between diminazene-and vehicle-treated mice on LSS-and OSS-induced plaques. One-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-test was used to evaluate ICAM-1 expression in HVEC. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). A value of P<0.05 was considered significant and the results are expressed as mean\u00b1SEM.\n\nACE2 protein expression in atherosclerotic plaques was assessed by immunostaining. We found that ACE2 was strongly expressed in the LSS-induced plaques and aortic sinus plaques (figure 1 A-C). Interestingly, this enzyme was weakly expressed or even not detected in OSSinduced plaques (figure 1 B), indicating that ACE2 expression might be modulated by local shear stress forces or may differ according to the intraplaque composition and environment.\n\nNo difference in ACE2 expression was observed between diminazene or vehicle treated mice (data not shown).\n\nOne possible explanation for the diminishing ACE2 levels in OSS-induced plaque would be an increased shedding from the tissues by A disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM17)\n\n[32]. ADAM17 is involved in the shedding of several transmembrane proteins, including ACE2 [33]. Based on that, the intraplaque expression of ADAM17 was evaluated and no difference was observed between LSS-and OSS-induced plaques (figure 2). Therefore, apparently, an increased expression of ADAM-17 is not associated to the lower presence of ACE2 in OSS-induced plaques.\n\nIn order to better understand the function of ACE2 within the atherosclerotic lesion, ACE2 was co-immunostained with CD68 and Ly6B.2, specific markers for macrophage and neutrophil. It was observed that ACE2 was not intensely co-localized with CD68 or Ly6B.2 (figure 3), suggesting that macrophage and neutrophil are not the mean source of ACE2 intraplaque.\n\nLipid content within LSS-induced carotid plaques presented a tendency to be reduced in the diminazene treated mice (25% of reduction), but no statistical significance was observed (P=0.308, figure 4 A and D). The treatment with diminazene did not alter lipid content in OSS-induced plaque and aortic sinus (figure 4 B, C and D). Similarly, atherosclerotic lesion size in the aorta tree was not altered by diminazene treatment (table 1) .\n\nAlthough diminazene treatment did not significantly altered the atherosclerotic plaque lipid content and size, it did ameliorate plaque composition. Diminazene significantly increased the intraplaque total collagen content in LSS-induced and aortic sinus plaques, as compared \n\nAt the end of the experiment, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol or free fatty acid serum levels were assessed. Diminazene 11 treatment significantly reduced triglycerides serum levels. No other parameters were altered (table 1) .\n\nTo examine the mechanism by which diminazene decreased macrophage infiltration, ICAM- \n\nThe circulatory levels of key cytokines and chemokines in the atherosclerotic condition were measured in the serum of diminazene-treated and untreated mice. The long-term treatment with diminazene significantly reduced IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and VEGF serum level (table 2) . Although no statistical significance was reached, diminazene treatment produced a strong tendency to reduce MCP-1 serum levels (p=0.085, table 2). Diminazene slightly reduced IFN-\u03b3, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A, and TNF-\u03b1 serum level, but no statistical significance was measured (table 2) .\n\nShear stress forces are one of the main factors modulating atherosclerosis. These biomechanical elements influence several molecular mechanism and control atherosclerotic plaque composition [3] [4] [5] . In the present study, we found that ACE2, a major enzyme of the renin angiotensin system, was expressed in LSS-induced atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid artery and aortic sinus; however, poor to undetectable expression was seen in OSS- One well-known mechanism responsible for local depletion of ACE2 is an augmented shedding by ADAM17 [32]. Here we observed that ADAM17 was well expressed in both LSS-and OSS-induced plaques; however, no difference in expression between them was observed. As a limitation, the intraplaque activity of ADAM17 was not measured, and despite ADAM17 expression is similar between LSS-and OSS-induced plaques, it could be possible that this enzyme is more active in OSS than LSS region. Indeed, it has been reported that ADAM17 is overactive in human carotid atherosclerotic plaques of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients (condition associated with accelerated atherosclerosis), which was associated with a decrease of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3, an endogenous inhibitor of ADAM17 13 [35] . Nevertheless, the mechanism by which ACE2 is poorly expressed in OSS-induced plaques remains to be elucidated.\n\nInterestingly, three weeks of diminazene treatment ameliorated the composition of LSSinduced carotid and aortic sinus plaques, while it did not affect OSS-induced carotid plaque. Additionally, diminazene may also upregulate the expression of ACE2 [27], indicating that this compound not only augments intrinsic enzyme activity, but also increases the total enzyme expression. The relevance of each mechanism most likely depends on the treatment condition and, despite both mechanisms, synergistical output to increase ACE2 activity, it still remains to be elucidated. In our study, we observed that diminazene acted only in atherosclerotic plaque expressing ACE2, suggesting that the effects of this compound depends on ACE2. However, as in the present study was not possible to assess the levels of Ang II and Ang-(1-7) within the atherosclerotic plaques, the mechanism by which diminazene improves the plaque stability should be prudently interpreted. Despite apparently inconsistent data, it is reasonable to infer that the short period of treatment was not sufficient to reduce the plaque size and/or that the pharmacological activation of ACE2 by diminazene is less effective compared to gene transfer overexpression.\n\nNonetheless, diminazene improved the lesion composition for a more stable phenotype, diminishing the infiltration of inflammatory cells and increasing collagen deposition. In support to our data, Dong and co-workers [22] showed that ACE2 overexpression enhances plaque stability in a rabbit model of atherosclerosis by reducing macrophages infiltration, decreasing lipid deposition, lowering MMP-3 and MMP-9 activity, and increasing in collagen content. Similarly, ACE2 gene deletion increased atherosclerotic vulnerability by increasing the intraplaque inflammatory profile [23] [24] [25] . Therefore, the pharmacological activation of ACE2 by diminazene appears to be consistent the previous studies evaluating ACE2 overexpression or deletion.\n\nInterestingly, in the present study, we reported that diminazene action depends on the local pattern of shear stress. In LSS and aortic sinus plaques, diminazene increased collagen content, decreased MMP-9 expression and reduced macrophage infiltration, while in OSSinduced carotid plaques, none of the studied parameters where altered. The possible lack of action in OSS region might be due to the fact that ACE2 was poorly expressed in such plaques. It is reasonable to argue that, since ACE2 is widely expressed in the cardiovascular system, shifting the balance between Ang-(1-7) and Ang II, it is possible that increased Ang-(1-7) circulating levels would modulate OSS-induced plaque phenotype. Notwithstanding, we previously reported that long-term treatment with Ang-(1-7) ameliorates the phenotype of 16 LSS-induced plaques, but did not affect OSS-induced plaques [18] . Therefore, the probable increase in circulating level of Ang-(1-7) via diminazene would not affect OSS plaque composition. Despite of the above speculations the mechanism as to why diminazene did not affect OSS-induced plaques still remains to be elucidated.\n\nHere we reported that diminazene treatment significantly reduced the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, critical adhesion molecules on endothelial cells favoring atherosclerosis. . VEGF is a signal protein with multipotent actions documented in vivo and in vitro; however, its action on plaque vulnerability is not completely understood [51]. In general, it is recognized that VEGF causes immature intraplaque neovascularization highly susceptible to leakage or rupture [52] . Together, these findings suggest that diminazene ameliorates plaque stability parameters by inhibiting the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and reducing macrophage infiltration. However, such mechanism still needs to be clarified.\n\nAlthough one might argue that diminazene may decrease blood pressure and modify the hemodynamic profile at the site of atherosclerosis formation, altering the plaque development and/or composition, previous publications indicated that diminazene does not change blood pressure. It has been documented that diminazene reduced pulmonary hypertension in a rat model without affecting basal systemic blood pressure [27] . Similarly, in a rat model of kidney injury, diminazene produced beneficial outcomes without changing blood pressure [53] . Moreover, diminazene attenuated ischemia-induced cardiac pathophysiology and did affect systolic blood pressure [41] . These results suggest that diminazene-mediated activity is independent on blood pressure change. Nevertheless, as a limitation, the present study did not assess the blood pressure of the studied animals. n.s.: non-significant and ***P < 0.01 (One-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-test).\n\nData are expressed as mean\u00b1SEM of mean fluorescence intensity.
