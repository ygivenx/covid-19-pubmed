{"title": "Development of a realtime RT-PCR assay for the rapid detection of influenza A(H2) viruses", "body": "Influenza virus is an enveloped virus with segmented (-)ssRNA genome belonging to family Orthomyxoviridae. Family comprises 5 genera recognized by ICTV: Influenzavirus A, Influenzavirus B, Influenzavirus C, Thogotovirus and Isavirus, and 2 proposed genera e Quaranjavirus and Influenzavirus D. Influenza A viruses are most variable of all orthomyxoviruses being the cause of influenza epidemics and pandemics. Now 18 hemagglutinin (HA) and 11 neuraminidase (NA) subtypes of influenza A virus are recognized. Most of them have waterfowl as a host. Only influenza viruses of H1, H2 and H3 subtypes are known to cause pandemics and circulate in human population for considerable time. Only sporadic cases of infection on human-animal interface by influenza A(H5), A(H6), A(H7), A(H9) and A(H10) were observed.\n\nOver the past 100 years mankind survived five pandemics of influenza A: from devastating \"Spanish flu\" in 1918 taking more than 50 million lives to \"Swine flu\" in 2009 with much less mortality and economic losses. In so called \"Asian flu\" pandemics in 1957e1958, caused by influenza A(H2N2) virus around 1e2 million lethal cases were registered [1] . This virus emerged in humans following antigenic shift resulting from reassortment between circulating human H1N1 influenza virus and avian H2N2 influenza viruses. This reassortant 1957 pandemic viruses possessed the HA (4), NA (6) , and PB1(2) gene segments of an avian H2N2 virus while the remaining five were of human H1N1 virus origin [2] . Pandemic started in Northern China in February 1957 [3] and in several weeks spread to South East Asia. In USSR first cases were registered in Central Asia (Tashkent, Dushanbe, Almaty), first wave of pandemic reached European part of USSR in the end of May 1957 [4] . Mortality rate in Leningrad in 1957e1959 was near 1.5% of population [5] . In 1968 influenza A(H2N2) virus was superseded by influenza A(H3N2) virus.\n\nExpelled from human population in 1968 influenza A(H2N2) viruses continue to circulate in wild birds and poultry [6e8]. Two phylogenetic lineages of influenza A(H2) viruses exist: Eurasian and American. Avian influenza A(H2) viruses of Eurasian lineage are phylogenetically and antigenically close to 1957 pandemic strain [6, 9] . Influenza A(H2) strains of American lineage were isolated from swine. It was shown that swine H2 viruses have altered receptor specificity recognizing a2-6 sialic acids and are capable of contact transmission from swine to swine [9] .\n\nSusceptibility to infection is determined by various host factors including presence or absence of specific antibodies produced as a result of previous infection or vaccination. Influenza A(H2N2) virus has not circulated in humans for over 50 years, vaccination stopped in the late 1960s, so now the population is almost immunologically na\u00efve to influenza A(H2) infection. People born after 1968 are seronegative to influenza A(H2) [1, 10, 11] . The lack of immunity and the continued circulation of influenza A (H2) in wild birds, poultry and swine raises a serious concern for the emergence of a new pandemic.\n\nTo date conventional RT-PCR technique for detection of A(H2N2) viruses has been established [12] . Conventional RT-PCR is more laborious and error-prone due to risk of contamination by PCR products. Also there are realtime RT-PCR assays for wide spectrum of influenza A viruses, including H2 strains [13] .\n\nThe aim of the current study was to develop and evaluate realtime RT-PCR-based assay for rapid detection of influenza A(H2) viruses.\n\nA/Japan/305/1957 (H2N2), A/Saint-Petersburg/RII66/2009 (H1N1), A/seal/Caspian sea/01/2000 (H7N7) and A/herring gull/Atyrau/2186/2007 (H11N2) and LAIV A/ 17/California/66/395 (H2N2) were stored, propagated using 10-day-old chicken embryos according to the method described previously [14] . Influenza viruses A/Nizhniy Novgorod/RII01/2013 (H1N1pdm09) and A/Saint-Petersburg/RII06/2013 (H3N2) were propagated on MDCK cells. 50% embryonic infective dose (EID50) was calculated using Reed-Muench method [15] .\n\n539 full-length (>1700 nt, duplicates removed) sequences of H2 hemagglutinin gene (433eavian, 91ehuman, 3eother mammals, 12eenvironmental) were obtained from EpiFlu GISAID database (See Table A .1). Shannon entropy as an estimate of sequence conservation was calculated using Python script. Python script is available on GitHub (https://github.com/MVGE-lab/shannonenthropy-calculator). Local minima in distribution of Shannon entropy were selected for TaqMan primers and probes design.\n\nPrimers and probes were designed using Beacon Designer v7.70 (Premier Biosoft). The following requirements were used for Taq-Man probes design: probe length 18e25 nt, DG max (hairpin) \u00c06.0 kcal/mol, DG max (dimer) \u00c010.0 kcal/mol, maximum repeat length 5 nt. Probe rating was calculated using the formula:\n\nN e number of parameters P n e calculated value of parameter n T n e set value of parameter n V n e permissible limit of variation of parameter n Only probes with rating from 80 to 100 were selected for further analysis. For all selected probes Shannon entropy values were calculated using Python script. Sequence conservation of probes was visualized using WebLogo [16, 17] . The specificity of primers and probes was verified by Primer BLAST [18] and BLAST [19] , respectively. The probes were labeled with FAM and JOE at the 5'end and BHQ1 and BHQ2 at the 3'-end. The primers and probe used are listed in Table 1 .\n\nTotal RNA was extracted from allantoic fluid and cell culture supernatant using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer's instructions. rRT-PCR was performed using AgPathID One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Ambion, USA). 25-ml reaction mixture contained 12.5 ml 2x reaction premix, 0.5 ml forward primer (20 pmol/ml), 0.5 ml reverse primer (20 pmol/ml), 0.5 ml probe (5 pmol/ml), 1 ml template and 10 ml of DEPC-treated water. Reactions were performed on Bio-Rad CFX96 realtime PCR instrument (Bio-Rad, USA) using the following cycling conditions: 30 min at 50 C, 10 min at 95 C and 45 cycles of 15 s at 95 C and 30 s at 55 C. DEPC-treated water was used as a no template control (NTC). The data was analyzed using Bio-Rad CFX Manager 2.1 sofware. Ct cutoff value was set 38.\n\nPCR amplicons were analyzed by agarose electrophoresis, agarose gels were documented using ChemiDoc MP gel documentation system (Bio-Rad). DNA was extracted from agarose gels by QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer's instructions. Concentration of DNA was assessed using NanoDrop spectrophotometer. Capillary sequencing was performed on ABI 3130 genetic analyzer using BigDye Terminator v3.1 kit (Thermo).\n\n10-fold serial dilutions of pCI-neo expression vector containing H2 HA Gene (FR-576) plasmid DNA were used as the templates for RT-PCR to determine the standard curve and evaluate PCR efficiency of novel assay. rRT-PCR efficiency was evaluated using 10fold serial dilutions of influenza A/17/California/66/395 (H2N2) virus preparation with known infectious titer.\n\nLimit of detection (LOD) was defined as the highest dilution at which 95% of positive samples were detected. 5-fold serial dilutions of allantoic fluid containing A/Japan/305/1957 (H2N2) with infectious titer 1.39 \u00c2 10 9 EID 50 /ml in 20 replicates were used for LOD estimation. Then five 2-fold dilutions covering the range from 2.22 to 3.42 lg EID 50 /ml were tested and probit analysis was conducted using Statgraphics Centurion XVI (StatPoint Technologies, Inc.).\n\nThree 5-fold dilutions of A/Japan/305/1957 (H2N2) virus in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and influenza and non-influenza respiratory viruses PCR-negative nasopharyngeal swab collected in virus transport medium (Copan VTM) spiked with the same virus dose were prepared to test the performance of RT-PCR assay on artificial human specimens.\n\nThe specificity of novel assay was evaluated using influenza Also specificity of novel assay was tested on common noninfluenza respiratory viruses (hRSV subtype A (strain A2), hRSV subtype A (strain 9320), human parainfluenza virus type 2 (HPIV2/ Saint-Petersburg/10568/2011) and human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3/Saint-Petersburg/123/2014), adenovirus serotype 1 (type C) from Research Institute of Influenza virus collection. Finally specificity of developed RT-PCR assays was tested on clinical samples positive for influenza A(H3N2), influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza B and various non-influenza respiratory viruses (hRSV, adenovirus, hPIV, rhinovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus and human metapneumovirus) from primary respiratory specimen biobank of RII. Probes were checked for specificity in silico using BLAST 2.2.28 \u00fe against non-H2 influenza A viruses and human genomes (Human genomic plus transcript, G \u00fe T database). Probes aligning with non-H2 influenza A virus sequences were excluded from analysis. Probes aligning with human genome sequences were excluded from analysis if query cover in BLAST 2.2.28 \u00fe exceeded 70%. Occasional sequence homology with human genome (query cover 70% and less) indicated that special attention should be payed to design of primers to be used with this probe in one assay.\n\nShannon entropy distribution along the probes sequences was evaluated. As TaqMan technology is based on 5'-end reporter cleavage by polymerase, probes with little sequence conservation in 5'-end were excluded from further analysis. Finally two probes candidates were selected: H2-1 and H2-2, for which WebLogos were made (Fig. 1 ). FAM and JOE dyes and BHQ-1 and BHQ-2 quenchers were chosen for selected probes.\n\nThe following criteria were used for primer design: primer melting temperature should be 5e10 \u0421 lower than probe melting temperature, difference in melting temperature between forward and reverse primer should not exceed 3 \u0421, amplicon length should be 70e200 bp, distance between primer 3'-end and probe 5'-end shoud not be longer than 20 nt. Primers H2-F1/H2-R1 and H2-F2/ H2-R2 were designed (See Table 1 ). Primers specificity was tested in silico using Primer BLAST [18] , against all sequences excluding influenza A/H2.\n\n10-fold serial dilutions of pCI-neo plasmid DNA encoding HA gene of influenza A/Japan/305/1957 (H2N2) virus were used to evaluate PCR efficiency of H2-1 and H2-2 primer and probe sets. For set H2-1 the equation used to generate the standard curve was y \u00bc \u00c03.320x\u00fe11.57, the linear regression coefficient (R 2 ) was 0.9935, and the amplification efficiency was 100%. For set H2-2 the equation used to generate the standard curve was y \u00bc \u00c03.171x\u00fe16.87, the linear regression coefficient (R 2 ) was 0.9842, and the amplification efficiency (E) was 106% (See Fig. 2A) .\n\nDetection limit was calculated to be 1.2 \u00c2 10 \u00c08 ng/ml (50 copies of DNA template in 25 ml reaction volume). To evaluate RT-PCR efficiency 10-fold serial dilutions of influenza A/17/California/66/395 (H2N2) virus (infectious titer 1.78 \u00c2 10 9 EID 50 /ml) were used. For set H2-1 the equation used to generate the standard curve was y \u00bc \u00c03.306x\u00fe44.50, the linear regression coefficient (R 2 ) was 0.9995, and the amplification efficiency was 100.7%. For set H2-2 the equation used to generate the standard curve was y \u00bc \u00c03.311x\u00fe43.86, the linear regression coefficient (R 2 ) was 0.9996, and the amplification efficiency (E) was 100.5% (See Fig. 2B ).\n\n5-fold serial dilutions of A/Japan/305/1957 (H2N2) virus were used to estimate novel assay analytical sensitivity. Probit analysis was used to determine LOD. Limit of detection for set H2-1 (LOD 1 ) was 3.2 (CI95%: 3.07e3.48) lg EID 50 /ml, (See Fig. 3B ).\n\nIn order to test possible interference of human material and virus transport medium with assay performance we compared RT-PCR results obtained on three 5-fold dilutions of A/Japan/305/1957 (H2N2) virus in PBS and clinical specimen spiked with the same \n\nPredicted PCR amplicon length for H2-1 and H2-2 primer sets was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis (See Fig. 4B ). Partial capillary sequencing and sequence alignment further confirmed amplicon identity.\n\nThe specificity of novel rRT-PCR assay was tested using influenza viruses of various subtypes from RII virus collection and CDC realtime PCR positive controls and non-influenza respiratory viruses (see Table 2 ). Both H2-1 and H2-2 primers/probe sets showed high specificity for influenza A(H2) viruses, yielding no fluorescence signal from samples containing common human influenza A viruses and emerging influenza viruses like influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9). H2-2 set demonstrated weak near cut-off fluorescent signal on some human seasonal influenza A(H1N1) influenza virus and pooled influenza positive control (PIPC). Finally, specificity of developed RT-PCR assays was tested on clinical samples positive for influenza A(H3N2), influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza B and various non-influenza respiratory viruses (hRSV, adenovirus, hPIV, rhinovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus and human metapneumovirus) from primary respiratory specimen biobank of RII demonstrating no false positive results. Based on analytical specificity H2-2 was considered to perform non-satisfactory.\n\nInfluenza A(H2N2) virus can infect various host species including waterfowl, swine and humans. In 1968 influenza A(H2N2) viruses were superseded from circulation in humans by [12] . Conventional PCR has many disadvantages in diagnostic use due to laboriousness, high risk of contamination and long turnaround time. Several protocols for influenza subtyping using conventional PCR were published [21, 22] . Recently, Hoffmann and colleagues described RITA, realtime RT-PCR assay for wide spectrum of influenza A viruses, including H2 strains [13] . Yet, we had no opportunity for experimental comparison of RITA and our protocol for influenza A(H2) detection. In this study, two sets of primers and TaqMan probes were designed based on the conserved regions of the HA gene of influenza A(H2) viruses. Conserved regions were identified by analysis of Shannon entropy distribution. Developed assays successfully passed in silico evaluation and were selected for further experimental evaluation. rRT-PCR efficiency was experimentally estimated to be around 100% fulfilling MIQE criteria for PCR assays [23] . Described primer/probe H2-1 and H2-2 sets showed different specificity on different influenza strains. H2-2 set demonstrated false positive results on some seasonal influenza A(H1N1) strains and pooled influenza positive control (PIPC). Thus H2-2 was considered to be inappropriate for use and excluded from further experimental evaluation.\n\nH2-1 rRT-PCR assay showed moderate sensitivity. Plasmid DNA template detection limit of the assay was 50 copies per 25 ml reaction. Limit of detection tested on serial dilutions of infectious virus was 10 3.2 EID 50 /ml (3.2 (CI95%: 3.07e3.48) lg EID 50 /ml). Obtained LOD is higher, than those for the real-time quantitative RT-PCR targeting the M gene, which are usually used as the \"gold standard (e.g. 10 0.3 TCID 50 /ml for H7N9 assay [24] , 10 1.3 EID 50 /ml for CDC Influenza 2009 A(H1N1)pdm Real-Time RT-PCR Panel [25] ), but we consider it acceptable for qualitative RT-PCR testing. Using artificial human specimens we demonstrated that developed H2-1 assay is suitable for use on human specimens containing diverse interfering substances. In summary, a realtime RT-PCR assay (H2-1) for detection of the influenza A(H2) viruses was designed, and was shown to have adequate sensitivity and specificity. Availability of realtime RT-PCR assays for potentially pandemic influenza viruses is important for pandemic preparedness, making easier early identification of pandemic strain.\n\nAll authors have contributed to, seen and approved the manuscript.
