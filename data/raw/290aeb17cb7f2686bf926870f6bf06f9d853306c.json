{"title": "Clinical features and the maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019", "body": "The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has spread quickly from Wuhan, China to all other major cities in China and is rapidly spreading to a growing number of other countries despite efforts at containment and isolation 1 . The population is generally susceptible to this newly identified coronavirus 2 , initially termed 2019-nCoV and subsequently SARS-CoV-2. Early efforts have focused on describing the clinical characteristics and outcomes of Covid-19 in the general population 1, 3, 4 . However, the disease appears to be particularly impactful in special populations that include those older than sixty-five years of age 5 . Pregnant women are also considered to be a special population group because of the unique 'immune suppression' caused by pregnancy 6 . The immunologic and physiologic changes might make pregnant women at higher risk of severe illness or mortality with Covid-19, compared with the general public. However, there is little information on Covid-19 during pregnancy. This study aimed to determine the clinical features and the maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with Covid-19.\n\nThis is a retrospective analysis of data from multiple centers.

All five hospitals assigned by the government to be responsible for the treatments of pregnant women with Covid-19. The Institutional Review Board of Huazhong University of Science and Technology approved this study (#TJ-IRB20200222). All pregnant women gave informed consent to participate in this study.\n\nBased on the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (6th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China 7 , those with one of the following laboratory evidence is considered to have a confirmed Covid-19 case: (1) positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by real-time reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR); (2) viral gene sequencing showing highly homogeneity to the known SARS-CoV-2. Real-time RT-PCR assays were performed following the protocol established by the WHO 8 .\n\nWe collected data of all pregnant women and newborns from electronic medical records with data collection forms. If there were deficiencies in the data, we directly communicated with the pregnant women and/or their family members by telephone to acquire additional information.

The Pregnancy outcome was classified based on the gestational age at delivery (<37 weeks or \u2265 37 weeks), mode of delivery (vaginal or cesarean section), indication for cesarean section, and obstetrical complications. Information collected from newborns included birth weight, Apgar score, neonatal death, tests for SARS-CoV-2, and manifestations of Covid-19. Low birth weight was defined as a birth weight of less than 2,500 grams 9 . Very low birth weight was defined as a birth weight of less than 1,500 grams 9 .\n\nAll rights reserved.

Secondary endpoints included the clinical severity of Covid-19, neonatal mortality, admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) of pregnant women or newborns.\n\nPatient characteristics were presented using descriptive statistics. Continuous variables were summarized using the mean and standard deviations, while categorical variables were calculated using the frequency and percentage. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).\n\nOur retrospective analysis revealed a total of 33 pregnant women with Covid-19 who were admitted to 5 public hospitals in Hubei Province. The maternal age ranged from 24 to 36 years. Among the affected, there were 8 (24.2%) health care workers, and 32 (97%) of women had a history of exposure. Three women were in the second trimester (17 weeks, 20 weeks, and 26 weeks), and the other 30 women were in the third trimester at the time of presentation.\n\nFifteen (45.5%) women had chronic disorders involving cardiovascular and cerebrovascular, digestive, endocrine, and nervous systems, as well as infectious diseases and depressive All rights reserved.

All women received antiviral therapy. Twenty-nine (87.9%) women were given antibiotic treatment, 11 (33.3%) were treated with glucocorticoids, and 12 (36.4%) received traditional Chinese medicine (Table 1) .\n\nTwenty-two (81.5%) women delivered via cesarean section, and 5(18.5%) had vaginal deliveries. The overall rate of obstetrical complications was 22.2%, including three cases of preterm premature rupture of membranes, two cases of hypertensive diseases of the pregnancy, two cases of gestational diabetes mellitus, and one case of spontaneous preterm labor.

No pregnant women proceeded to severe complications or were admitted to the ICU, and there was no mortality.\n\nThere were 28 newborns born to 27 women, ten (35.7%) of whom were delivered preterm.\n\nThe 1-min Apgar score of all newborns ranged from 8-10. The 5-min Apgar score of all newborns ranged from 9-10. All newborns were isolated after birth and fed by milk formula.\n\nFive (17.9%) newborns had low birth weight, and no newborn had very low birth weight.\n\nFour (14.3%) newborns were diagnosed with fetal distress. One newborn who was born at 34 weeks of gestation, was transferred to the NICU with a diagnosis of ARDS. At the end of the follow-up, this newborn recovered and was discharged. No newborns had clinical symptoms of Covid-19 or died (Table 3) .\n\nAt the end of the follow-up, two newborns had not been tested for SARS-CoV-2 because their parents asked to delay the test to 14 days after birth. Twenty-six newborns were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time RT-PCR assays of throat swabs. Among those, one newborn tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus yielding a perinatal transmission rate of 3.6%.\n\nThe mother of this newborn was sent to the hospital because of a fever. The mother wore N95 masks during the cesarean section. All medical staff wore protective suits. The newborn had no contact with his mother and other family members. He was directly transferred to the neonatal department and isolated immediately after birth. A throat swab from this mother was All rights reserved.

However, the result was not reported until 36 h after birth because of the massive number of samples that needed testing during the Covid-19 outbreak. Real-time RT-PCR showed that the mother was positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. At the same time, the throat swab sample was taken from the newborn for a nucleic acid test, which also came back positive. In addition, the chest X-ray of the newborn 53 h after birth was consistent with pulmonary infection. However, the cord \n\nIn this study, we reported a case series of pregnant women with Covid-19 and newborns born to these women. The primary composite endpoint occurred in one (3%) pregnant woman who needed the use of mechanical ventilation, while no pregnant women admitted to the ICU or died. For the secondary outcomes, the percentages of pregnant women with mild, moderate, and severe symptoms were 13 (39.4%),19(57.6%), and 1(3%). One (3.6%) newborn developed ARDS and was admitted to the NICU. There were no moralities among newborns.\n\nThere is limited knowledge regarding Covid-19 that occurs during pregnancy.

The clinical outcomes among pregnant women with SARS or MERS were worse than those occurring in non-pregnant women 6, 10 . However, our data suggest the contrary to Covid-19. Among the 33 pregnant women with confirmed Covid-19, 39.4% of women presented mild, 57.6% presented moderate, and 3% presented with severe symptoms. For most pregnant women (87.9%), oxygen therapy supplied via a nasal cannula or mask was sufficient for supportive care. Only one (3%) pregnant woman needed the use of mechanical ventilation. At the end of the follow-up, no pregnant women had severe complications or needed to be transferred to the ICU or died. Compared with the general population, in which 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who needed mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died 12 , it seems that the severity and mortality rate of Covid-19 in pregnant women are lower.\n\nThe risk of perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was low, as only one out of 26 newborns was confirmed to have a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In our study, this newborn's SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by the detection of virus in throat swab and chest X-ray abnormalities. However, we cannot prove that this is a case of vertical transmission because the cord blood and placental samples were both negative for SARS-CoV-2.\n\nHow SARS-CoV-2 invades the human body remains a mystery. Xu et al. first reported that SARS-CoV-2 shares 76.47% amino acid sequence identity with SARS-CoV, and may use the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for entry into target host cells 13 .\n\nZhao et al. found that ACE2 is specifically expressed in type II alveolar epithelial cells (AT2) in human lung, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may target ACE2-positive AT2 cells to induce All rights reserved.

Further studies showed that ACE2 protein is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine 15 , heart 16 , arterial smooth muscle cells, gastrointestinal system, renal tubules of kidney 17 and testes 18 , suggesting potential routes for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, urinary and male reproductive systems. Thus, this newborn could have been infected from many possible paths, such as via the respiratory system.\n\nHowever, this newborn's case may also be real vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 since the mother wore N95 masks during the cesarean section, and all medical staff wore protective suits. Furthermore, the newborn was isolated immediately after birth. These preventive measures should have decreased the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through the respiratory system of the mother, medical staff, and hospital environment. Second, previous studies have shown that ACE2 is expressed by the human endometrium and placenta 19, 20 . A recent study revealed that ACE2 is highly expressed in maternal-fetal interface cells, including stromal cells and perivascular cells of decidua, and cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast in placenta 21 . Thus, SARS-CoV-2 may also be attracted to the human endometrium and placenta though ACE2, causing vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Also, the SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in urine and stool 22 , suggesting a possibility of ascending infection of the uterus, placenta, and fetus. Third, it has been reported that the ACE2-expressing cell ratio is variable between individuals, which may explain why some people are more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 14 . This characteristic of ACE2 may explain why SARS-CoV-2 infected only one out of 26 newborns.\n\nAnother novelty of our study, the clinical characteristics and outcomes of infected All rights reserved.

Two mothers recovered without delivery, but their ongoing pregnancies were complicated by intrauterine growth restriction 6 . In our study, we included three women in the second trimester and 30 women in the third trimester at presentation.\n\nAmong the 33 women, 27 women delivered 28 newborns, and the live birth rate was 100%.\n\nFive women had ongoing pregnancy without severe obstetrical complications at the time of manuscript preparation. The overall rate of obstetrical complications was 22.2%, including three cases of preterm premature rupture of membranes, two cases of hypertensive diseases of the pregnancy, two cases of gestational diabetes mellitus, and one case of spontaneous preterm labor. Therefore, the obstetrical outcomes from pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection appear better than that for pregnant women with SARS. However, it's worth noting that most pregnant women were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the third trimester in this study. The gestational age when women are infected may affect obstetrical outcomes.\n\nIn a review of 11 pregnant women with MERS-CoV infection, the infant death rate was All rights reserved.
