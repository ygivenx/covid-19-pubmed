{"title": "", "body": "We determined RNA-protein equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd's) by the nitrocellulose-filter binding method as described (2) . For all binding assays, RNAs were dephosphorylated using alkaline phosphatase(New England Biolab), and 5'-end labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and \uf067 32 PATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway,NJ) as described (3). Before binding assay, heat aptamer at 95\u00b0C 3min, and then slowly ramp to 37\u00b0C at 0.1\u00b0C /sec in buffer (40 mM HEPES/pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.002% tween-20) for aptamer refolding. Direct binding assays were carried out by incubating 32 P-labeled RNA at a concentration of less than 10 pM and protein at concentrations ranging from 1 mM to 10 fM in selection buffer at 37\u00b0C.\n\nThe fraction of RNA bound was quantified with a PhosphorImager (Fuji FLA-5100 Image Analyzer, Tokyo, Japan). Raw binding data were corrected for nonspecific background binding of radiolabeled RNA to the nitrocellulose filter as described (2) and reported as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM) of three experiments.\n\nIn Figure 1C & Supplementary Figure S1 , binding mixture of 32 P-labeled aptamer(1 X 10 5 CPMA), 3 \u03bcg of yeast tRNA, and100 nM of RIG-I protein was separated in 4% PAGE containing 1.33% Glycerol. To detection radioactivity of aptamer, it was exposed on X-ray film (Fujifilm).\n\nTo obtain the short form of polyI:C, 1 U of RNaseIII (Takara) was incubated with 10 \u03bcg of polyI:C at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour, and fragmented polyI:C was precipitated using phenol/ethanol precipitation (4)."}
