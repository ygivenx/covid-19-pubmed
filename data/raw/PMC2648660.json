{"title": "Smallpox and Season: Reanalysis of Historical Data", "body": "Smallpox is the only disease to have been eradicated worldwide [1]. Despite\nthe success story of vaccination and other public health interventions, the\nnumber of susceptible individuals has grown to date following cessation of\nroutine vaccination, and the threat of bioterrorist attack has led to debates\non countermeasures in such an event [2]. Various mathematical studies have been\nconducted as part of a preparedness program, including large-scale simulation of\na bioterrorist attack and the public health countermeasures against it [3\u20136]. Theoretical\nstudies on the spread of smallpox include not only simulations but also\nquantitative analysis of historical data [7\u201310]. A\nstatistical modeling study suggests that a small outbreak could be contained only\nimplementing contact tracing and isolation [11]. Moreover, those who underwent\nvaccination in the past are believed to be still protected against severe and\nfatal manifestations of smallpox even today [7, 12].\n\n\nStudies on smallpox control have progressed in parallel with the\ndevelopment of epidemiological and statistical methods, and because of the eradication\nbefore maturation of biostatistics, many questions have remained in regards to\nthe details of the epidemiology. Seasonal variation in smallpox transmission is\none of the most pressing ecological questions playing a key role in determining\nthe transmission dynamics, should a future outbreak occur following the deliberate release [1, 4]. For example, clarification of the seasonal\npreference of variola virus is crucial for identifying and forecasting the\ndisease risk using ecological data [13]. Although seasonal occurrence of\nsmallpox was documented early on among directly transmitted infectious diseases\n[14, 15], and whereas the disease is believed to be one of the \u201cwinter diseases\u201d\nin industrialized countries, even the presence of seasonality has not been investigated\nin detail.\n\nThe best available evidence stems from a series of studies by Sir Leonard\nRogers (1868\u20131962) [16], who\nconducted epidemiologic surveys of smallpox outbreaks in India\nover a long period of time [17\u201319]. He also conducted\na similar survey in England and Wales [20]. By analyzing the monthly mortality data from the late 19th to the early\n20th century in these countries, Rogers argued that the smallpox epidemic in India is relatively \nuniform (i.e., not apparently cyclical) compared to that in England and Wales [17, 19, 21]. Further, he\ndescriptively and implicitly suggested that there is a negative correlation\nbetween humidity and smallpox mortality, but there was little association\nbetween smallpox and rainfall [17, 18]. This effort was followed by Russell and\nSundararajan [22] who supported the notion that a dry environment offers\nfavorable conditions for smallpox transmission. These consistent findings have also\nbeen reported during the Smallpox Eradication Program (SEP), where a peak of smallpox\nincidence occurred from December to January in the Northern hemisphere (e.g., Indonesia and Bangladesh)\nand from May to June in the Southern hemisphere (e.g., Brazil) [23\u201326]. However, the\nobserved data during the SEP were greatly modified by intensive immunizations,\nand perhaps because of this, epidemics in other locations were not suggested to\nbe seasonal [26\u201328], leaving this issue yet to be clarified.\n\nDespite the rigorous efforts before the global eradication, later\nprogress on this issue was unfortunately subtle. Upham once revisited Rogers's dataset from India, \nanthropologically discussing potential reasons why the American Southwest was less infested by smallpox\n[29]. A time series technique was applied to historical data in Finland and England [30\u201332], showing that\nperiodicity is mainly regulated by the susceptible fraction of a population in\nquestion [33]. However, despite the analyses on the impact of vaccination and\nmigration on periodicity, seasonal patterns of transmission have not been\nexplicitly studied, mainly because of a lack of data precision. In a historical\nstudy examining smallpox in England from the 16th to 17th centuries, the time referred to as the \u201clittle ice age,\u201d\nit has been documented that long-term climatic changes did little to the\nsmallpox transmission [34], but this conclusion was drawn without\nquantitatively and explicitly analyzing the data. Instead, the quality of time\nseries data and its impact on seasonality were discussed in relation to social\nbackgrounds of smallpox control [35, 36], but again no rigorous statistical analyses\nwere made using observed data.\n\nAccordingly, several lingering questions remain. Is smallpox transmission\nreally seasonal? If so, is the seasonality associated with humidity? Clarification\nof these points will not only enhance our understanding of the pattern of smallpox\ntransmission, but also will be crucial for identifying the seasonal preference\nof variola virus with some implications for bioterrorism preparedness plans. \nThe present study is aimed at examining the presence of seasonality and clarifying\nthe relationships between smallpox and climate. We reanalyzed various\nhistorical datasets, suggesting a new method for the analysis of time series.\n\nSeven temporal distributions of smallpox at different times and locations\nwere extracted from historical literature. This literature review was based on\nreferences collected by tracking all the references given in the relevant\npublications and repeating this task until we could find no further references;\nthe details are given elsewhere [37, 38]. Figure 1 shows the time series data\nby location with a monthly reporting interval. Chronologically, epidemic\nrecords for The Hague (1755\u20131773), Berlin (1758\u20131774), Zurich (1870\u20131887), the entire\nNetherlands (1870\u20131873), Northwest\nFrontier province in India (1890\u20131921), Shanghai\n(1900\u20131913), and Bombay\n(1902\u20131907) provide monthly\ndata of smallpox with time and were used for further analysis [17, 39\u201345]. The first\ntwo records contain data before the introduction of vaccination. Except for Zurich, which documents the\nmonthly number of cases, the remaining datasets record only monthly deaths. \nDeath data are given as the absolute number of deaths, except where indicated. \nWith regard to the magnitude of the epidemics, the annual averages of the\ndisaster size were 10.1 deaths (The Hague), 32.9 deaths (Berlin), 9.9 cases\n(Zurich), 428.6 deaths (the entire Netherlands), 5.28 deaths per 100 000\n(Northwest Frontier province in India), 21.5 deaths (Shanghai), and 2.45 deaths\nper 100 000 (Bombay). By examining another historical record of the smallpox\nepidemic in Tokyo, it was found that the mean (and the standard deviation) and the median (25\u201375% quartile)\ntime from onset to death were 29.1 (13.8) and 26.0 (19.0\u201337.0) days,\nrespectively [46]. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the relative frequency\nof death with time represents that of onset accompanied by approximately a 1\nmonth delay. Moreover, the infection may have happened approximately half a\nmonth before the onset [9]. Meteorological variables with time were given only\nin Rogers's observations [17], which contained the monthly rainfall \n(inch) and the absolute humidity.\n\n\nFirst, the presence of seasonality was examined for all 7 datasets using\nspectral density analysis. Spectral analysis is based on the idea of a\ntheoretical power-spectrum, which partitions the total variance of the series\namong sinusoidal components [47]. In other words, spectral density decomposes a\ntime series function into a sum of sines and cosines. The density plot (i.e.,\ncorrelogram) was graphically plotted to determine if a sharp peak at a period\nof 12 months exists, corresponding to an annual cycle (i.e., seasonality).\n\nSecond, seasonality that was evaluated using the effective reproduction\nnumber, R(t), defined as the actual average number of secondary cases per\nprimary case at calendar time t. R(t)\nshows a time-dependent variation with a decline in susceptible individuals\n(intrinsic factors) and with the implementation of control measures (extrinsic\nfactors). If R(t) < 1, it suggests that the epidemic is in decline (vice verca, if R(t) > 1). This approach was employed to clearly show the seasonal patterns of\ntransmission and to partly address the issue of dependence among cases, that\nis, statistically, the observation of an infected individual is not independent\nof other infected individuals, since the disease is transmitted directly from\nhuman to human.\n\n\nThe following approximation was made to derive estimates of R(t). \nSupposing that the number of new infections at calendar time t is I(t), the transmission dynamics are\ndescribed by the renewal equation using R(t) [48, 49]:(1)I(t)=R(t)\u222b0\u221eI(t\u2212\u03c4)\u03c9(\u03c4)d\u03c4, where \u03c9(\u03c4) is the probability density\nfunction of the generation time. The right-hand side of (1) represents\nsecondary transmissions at calendar time t,\nwhich are determined by the number of those who were infected at time t \u2212 \u03c4, I(t \u2212 \u03c4), and the magnitude of\nsecondary transmissions at time t, R(t). \nSince the data in the present study were recorded only monthly, the equation\nhas to be simplified to comply with discrete points of time data. From the\nbeginning of the history of mathematical modeling of smallpox in the late 19th\ncentury [50], cases tended to be modeled by generation, the idea of which is\napplied as follows. Given the number of cases in generation i, I\ni, the expected number of cases in generation i + 1,\nE(I\ni+1) is given by(2)E(Ii+1)=RiIi, where R\ni is the effective reproduction number of generation i [51]. That is, the reproduction number\nis simply given by ratio of successive generations of cases, which was\nimplicitly understood in history by a pioneering epidemiologist, Clare Oswald\nStallybrass (1881\u20141951) who\napplied the theory to analyze the seasonality of various infectious diseases\n[52, 53]. Since the mean generation time of smallpox is approximately 15 days\n(i.e., half a month) [50, 54], monthly data contains exactly two generations. Let\nus consider three successive generations, i, i + 1, and i + 2. Given the reproduction numbers R\ni and R\ni+1, we get(3)E(Ii+1)=RiIi,E(Ii+2)=Ri+1Ii+1. Considering that the generations i and i + 1 are grouped together and reported in\nthe same month j, the reproduction\nnumber cannot be estimated by generation i. \nInstead, by assuming that the reproduction numbers in the successive\ngenerations are identical, that is, R\ni = R\ni+1(:= R\nj), (3) can be rearranged as(4)E(Ii+1)=RjIi,E(Ii+2)=RjIi+1. The expected number of cases in the next generation i + 3 is given\nby product of I\ni+2 and the\nreproduction number in the next month j + 1, R\nj+1, that is,(5)E(Ii+3)=Rj+1Ii+2. Given (4) and (5), the number\nof cases in month j + 1, C\nj+1(:= I\ni+2 + I\ni+3)\nis given using C\nj(:= I\ni + I\ni+1), that is,(6)E(Cj+1)=E(Ii+2+Ii+3)=(1+Rj+1)Ii+2=(1+Rj+1)RjIi+1=(1+Rj+1)Rj2Ii=(1+Rj+1)Rj2Cj1+Rj. We assume that the expected\nvalues are sufficient to characterize Poisson distributions. This assumption\nindicates that the conditional distribution of the reported number of cases in\nmonth j + 1, C\nj+1, given\nC\nj is given by(7)Cj+1 \u2223 Cj\u223cPoisson[(1+Rj+1)Rj21+RjCj]. Thus, for the observation of\ncases (or deaths with a 1 month lag) from month 0 to N, the likelihood of estimating R\nj is given by(8)L=constant\u00d7\u220fj=0N\u22121[(1+Rj+1)Rj21+RjCj]Cj+1 \u00d7exp [\u2212(1+Rj+1)Rj21+RjCj]. By minimizing the negative\nlogarithm of (8), the maximum likelihood estimates of the monthly-approximated\nreproduction numbers, R\nj were obtained.\n\nThird, to identify the characteristic factors of seasonal variation in smallpox\ntransmissions, the relationships between meteorological variables (i.e.,\nrainfall and humidity) and incidence (mortality) as well as the effective\nreproduction number were examined. To examine the influence of seasonal\nvariables on the temporal trend of smallpox, we employed one of the generalized\nlinear models with the construction of a Poisson regression model incorporating\nmonthly and yearly terms [55]:(9)E(Cj)=exp{\u03b1+\u03b21(year)   +\u03b22[sin (2\u03c0\u00d7month12)]   +\u03b23[cos (2\u03c0\u00d7month12)]}, where E(Cj) is the expected number of cases (deaths) in month j, \u03b1 is\na constant, and \u03b2\ni are the regression coefficients for year\nor month. The relationship was investigated using both univariate and multivariate\nmodels. In the multivariate model, the year of occurrence was controlled for,\nbut the sine and cosine of the month were not included due to colinearity with\nrainfall. The mortality rate ratios (MRR) for the occurrence of smallpox death\nwere used to evaluate the impact of each meteorological variable on smallpox.\n\nWith regard to the relationship between meteorological variables and R(t),\nmultiple linear regression analysis was employed to determine factors contributing\nto R(t). Because of the obvious cyclical nature of the observed data\nyielding an autocorrelation in the linear regression analysis (Durbin-Watson =\n0.23), the monthly periodic terms (as shown in (9)) were added to the list of\nindependent variables. The level of statistical significance was set at \u03b1 = 0.05. All statistical data were analyzed\nusing the statistical software JMP version 7.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).\n\nThe spectral densities are shown in Figure 2 which can be reasonably interpreted\nby comparatively examining the temporal distributions (Figure 1). With\nregard to the data collected from The Hague and Berlin, the observations of\nwhich were made before the introduction of vaccinations, periodic epidemics (i.e.,\nsuper-annual cycles) are apparent where the interepidemic period ranges from 3\nto 5 years (see Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). However, the annual cycle is not seen,\nand thus, the spectral densities do not show a clear seasonal pattern (Figures\n2(a) and 2(b)). On the contrary, the time series data in Zurich and Shanghai\nclearly revealed a peak at 12 months (Figures 2(c) and 2(f)). The entire Netherlands\ndata covers a relatively short period of time compared to the other datasets (Figure 1(d)) with unclear seasonal and periodic frequencies in the spectral\ndiagram (Figure 2(d)). Although a small peak is seen at 12 months for the\ndata in the Northwest Frontier province in India\n(Figure 2(e)), the\ndensity plot exhibits a multimodal pattern, reflecting an irregular temporal\ndistribution (Figure 1(e)). In the Bombay\ndata, the annual cycle is most clearly highlighted in the temporal distribution\n(Figure 1(g)), which is also reflected in the spectral density (Figure\n2(g)).\n\n\nFigure 3 plots estimates of the effective reproduction number as a function of calendar time. The\nvertical broken lines represent January in every year, while a horizontal\ndashed line is a reference value yielding R(t) = 1, that is, the threshold condition\nof an epidemic. R(t) tends to increase during the winter\nseason for three early records (Figures 3(a), 3(b), \nand 3(c)), but the\nannual cycles are not seen. However, the short-term epidemic data for the\nentire Netherlands clearly shows that three peaks of R(t) coincide in every January with\nestimates above unity (Figure 3(d)). A similar pattern is observed in Shanghai and Bombay \n(Figures 3(f) and 3(g)). Figure 4 \nshows the spectral density plots of R(t)\nfor the entire Netherlands and Northwest Frontier province in India. Although spectral densities\nof death and mortality (Figures 2(d) and 2(e)) did not exhibit a clear\nannual cycle, the obvious peak at 12 months is seen for both datasets in terms\nof R(t) (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)). That is, seasonal patterns of\nsmallpox transmission were reasonably shown with the use of R(t)\neven for the short- and long-term time series.\n\n\nTable 1\nshows the output of univariate and multivariate models for explaining smallpox mortality\nin India\nusing meteorological variables. In both models, rainfall was not significantly\nassociated with smallpox mortality. However, significant negative association\nwas found for humidity (adjusted MRR = 0.387 (95% confidence interval (CI):\n0.311, 0.481), P < .01). Table 2 summarizes the relationship between\nthe effective reproduction number and meteorological variables using a multiple\nlinear regression model. On a whole, the model showed a weak predictive\nability. However, humidity was again identified as an explanatory variable\nwhich significantly reduces the effective reproduction number (P < .01). No significant correlation was found between R(t) and rainfall.\n\nThe present study\nreanalyzed historical records of smallpox to examine the presence of\nseasonality and to partly clarify the characteristic factors. Although 18th century\ndata did not show an apparent annual cycle, the remaining records reasonably\nshowed seasonal variations either in the monthly observation or the\nreproduction number. In particular, even the short-term epidemic data for the\nentire Netherlands\nclearly revealed peaks of transmission every January. Although several\nimportant meteorological variables were missing (e.g., temperature and\natmospheric pressure), Rogers's observation permitted investigations of a few variables as underlying factors\ncharacterizing the seasonality. Analyzing the meteorological data in India, both smallpox\nmortality and the reproduction number yielded significant negative association\nand correlation with humidity. Rainfall did not appear to be a useful predictor\nof seasonality.\n\nOne important\nmessage drawn from this exercise is that smallpox transmission is confirmed as seasonal\nand this is most likely associated with dry weather. This finding is consistent\nwith implicit suggestions which have accumulated in the historical literature\n[1, 17, 19]. Whereas the data from The Hague and\nBerlin did not offer the relevant interpretations, their periodic peaks were also observed\nduring the winter seasons. Assuming that these records captured mainly the\nlarge periodic outbreaks alone, it is plausible that the old data were\naccompanied by underreporting during less intensive years, and thus, did not\nprecisely contain subtle seasonal fluctuations. Given that the seasonal force\nof infection was obvious even in the short-term epidemic data from the entire Netherlands, \nnot only endemic but also epidemic smallpox would greatly vary with the season\nand most likely would be enhanced by dry weather. Historically, virologists\nattempted to attribute the annual cycle to the seasonal preference of the variola\nvirus [56\u201358]. To date, it\nis known that the variola virus could survive in an infective state under\ndifferent conditions of temperature and humidity [56, 57]. However, as temperature\nand humidity rise above 30\u00b0C and 55%, respectively, the virus is known to\nimmediately lose infectivity [57]. Such a virological explanation supports the epidemiologic\nfindings from this present study and reasonably explains the seasonal\npreference of the virus as a factor behind the seasonality of outbreaks. The\nabove-mentioned point implies that we cannot ignore the seasonality even in the\nevent of a short-term reintroduction of variola virus due to bioterrorist\nattack.\n\nA technical\ndevelopment in analyzing seasonal data is also notable. Since the observation\nof an infected individual is not independent of other infectious individuals,\ndirect application of the generalized linear model has not been \nappropriate to\ndate. One approach to resolve this issue is to employ a Bayesian method,\nexplicitly dealing with dependence in a Poisson regression model [59], which is,\nhowever, computationally complicated for nonspecialists. As an alternative, the\npresent study suggested the use of R(t). R(t) reasonably reflects time-dependent\nchanges in the susceptible fraction of the population in question and other various\nfactors determining the transmission (including seasonality) [60, 61]. In\nparticular, it should be noted that R(t) does not reflect onset or death but\ncan represent an infection event with time, proving its potential as a marker\nto model seasonal and periodic transmission cycles. In addition, quantitative\nassessment of R(t) is theoretically important, because the amplitude of seasonal\nforces of infection characterizes the length of the interepidemic period\n[33, 62, 63]. A continued super-annual cycle mathematically requires seasonally\nvarying forces of infection, which determines the season-specific threshold\ncondition [64] and evolutionary dynamics of a disease [65, 66]. To the best of\nour knowledge, the present study is the first to suggest a quantitative method to\nreasonably extract the amplitude using the notation of R(t) and extending the previous\nefforts of Stallybrass [53].\n\nMost infectious\ndiseases show characteristic seasonal variations in incidence. The present\nstudy confirms that the transmission of smallpox does vary with season. \nHowever, compared to the seasonal ecology of insects in vector-borne diseases,\nseasonal factors for directly transmitted diseases are far more complex, and\nthus, questions remain as to what exactly are the factors behind the\nseasonality of smallpox. At least, experimental evidence supports the role of dry weather in the dynamics of influenza [67, 68]; a recent study found that low (dry) relative humidity in the range of 20 to 30% produced the spread of the influenza virus faster than at relative humidity in higher percentages. In fact, at a humidity of 80% or above, the study found no spread of the flu [68]. Since there are also various social factors which vary\nwith the season, the seasonal preference of pathogens cannot be captured\nwithout sufficiently highlighting the time-varying human contact patterns, and\nthus, further analyses (e.g., reanalysis of small-scale outbreaks where we can\nadjust the contact frequency) are needed. We hope that the present study\nenhances the similar reanalysis of historical data, triggering an interest in\ninvestigating the relationship between the transmission of directly transmitted\ninfectious diseases and climatic changes.\n\nSeven historical datasets of smallpox were reanalyzed to\nexamine the presence of seasonality and to identify the characteristic factors. \nAnnual cycles were clearly shown not only in the monthly reports but also in\nthe estimates of the effective reproduction number. Even for a short-term\nepidemic, the transmission of smallpox would most likely be enhanced by dry\nweather."}
