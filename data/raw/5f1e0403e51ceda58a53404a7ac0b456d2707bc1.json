Mosquito-borne viruses are often labeled as arboviruses, a category that also includes tick-borne viruses.\n\nAnother virus carrier is the fruit bat. I remember walking through a beautiful park in Melbourne Australia on the way to Captain Cook's cottage. I was startled by the sight of huge black creatures hanging from trees that arched over the walkway. The racket they made when they all flew away was memorable. They were Australian fruit bats. From a park guide, I learned that there are 13 varieties of Australian fruit bats, popularly known as flying foxes because their ears and faces are foxlike. Fruit bats belong to the family Pteropodidae. They are hosts for both Nipah and Hendra viruses, which can cause disease in various animals and humans. Nipah and Hendra viruses are both members of the Paramyxoviridae family; neither virus is known to cause disease in their host bats. Nipah also infects pigs. Fruit bats inhabit many other regions and countries, including Africa, China, India, and Malaysia.\n\nCoronaviruses infect humans, other mammals, and birds. 6 Certain human coronaviruses are involved in the human to human transmission of some cases of the common cold. Some coronaviruses are zoonotic, infecting both their hosts and humans and other mammals. Examples include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The latter infections have been recognized only for the last several decades; it is possible that they have been around much longer but not identified as such. SARS is now definitively linked to bats. 7 Certain influenza viruses (H5N1, H7N9) can infect birds, chickens, ducks, and other wild and domesticated birds. Called bird flu, these viruses can be transmitted to humans who come in contact with the droppings and saliva of infected birds. In rare instances, human disease has resulted from eating undercooked eggs or poultry. Similarly, although infrequent, the H1N1 influenza virus can be transmitted from infected pigs to humans, hence its common name of swine flu. Questions remain about these cases because some infected persons with SARS and MERS never came into contact with pigs. 8 Even more uncommon is for a virus to be transmitted from an infected human to an animal. Two reports I read suggest that humans infected their pets (cats, dogs, ferrets) with the H1N1 virus. 9, 10 From what I could learn, however, the possibility that the animals and humans were independently infected from common sources has not been ruled out. In theory, infected humans could transmit the rabies virus to animals; no cases have been documented. 11 A NEW ANTIVIRAL AGENT Sheahan and colleagues 12 have reported that a novel antiviral, previously shown to be active against the acellular Ebola virus (Zaire ebolavirus), is also active against the coronaviruses SARS and MERS. Developed and named Remdesivir (GS-5734) by Gilead Sciences, it is a nucleotide analog prodrug. Gilead also studied it for Marburg virus. Ebola and Marburg are filoviruses. Results from other investigations suggest it may be effective against bat viruses and other viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus and Lassa fever virus. [12] [13] [14] Remdesivir is not currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration; however, some countries have authorized premarketing compassionate use.\n\nFor this issue of Clinical Therapeutics, our Infectious Diseases Topic Editor Dr Ravi Jhaveri has assembled a collection of articles entitled \"Hot Topics in Viral Diseases.\" The collection highlights recent controversies in vaccine licensure and recommendation, as well as advances in antiviral therapies for herpesvirus, hepatitis B and C, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza, with an emphasis on pediatric patients. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] In closing, I wish to congratulate Ravi on his promotion and change of venue. He is moving from the University of North Carolina to Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, where he will become professor of pediatrics and associate chief of infectious diseases at Lurie Children's Hospital.\n\nRichard I.
