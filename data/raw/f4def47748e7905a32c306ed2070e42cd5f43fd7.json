{"title": "Maternal serum concentrations of the chemokine CXCL10/IP-10 are elevated in acute pyelonephritis during pregnancy NIH Public Access", "body": "Acute pyelonephritis is one of the most frequent medical complications in pregnancy [1] , and a common cause of antepartum hospitalization [2] , with most of the cases occurring during the second trimester [3] . Complications following an event of acute pyelonephritis during pregnancy include anemia [3] [4] [5] , transient renal dysfunction [3] , preterm labor [1, 6] , sepsis [3, 7] , and septic shock [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Moreover, pregnant women with pyelonephritis are at increased risk to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [12] [13] [14] .\n\nThe human interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10 or CXCL10) is a chemokine of the CXC family [15] . A unique feature of some members of this type of chemokine is that they have pro-inflammatory properties and act as modulators of angiogenesis in conditions such as wound healing, ischemia, and neoplasia. These dual properties are related to the shared expression of specific chemokines receptors by leukocytes and endothelial cells [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] .\n\nIP-10 is inducible by pro-inflammatory stimuli such as interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] , tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) [37, [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] viruses, and microbial products [33, 37, [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] , either directly or through NF-kB [48, 49, [53] [54] [55] [56] . It has been proposed that this chemokine is also involved in the recruitment and potentiation of T-helper 1 (Th1) responses [57] [58] [59] .\n\nThe objective of this study was to determine whether the maternal serum concentrations of IP-10 are different in normal pregnancies and pregnant women with acute pyelonephritis.\n\nThis cross-sectional study included normal pregnant women (N=89) and pregnant patients with acute pyelonephritis (N=41). Patients were considered to have a normal pregnancy if they met the following criteria: 1) no medical, obstetrical or surgical complications; 2) absence of labor at the time of venipuncture, and 3) delivery of a normal term (\u226537 weeks) infant whose birth weight was between the 10 th to 90 th percentile for gestational age [60] . Acute pyelonephritis was diagnosed in the presence of fever (temperature \u2265 38\u00baC), clinical signs or symptoms of upper urinary infection (e.g., flank pain, costovertebral angle tenderness), pyuria, and a positive urine culture. Blood cultures were performed in 36 patients with pyelonephritis.\n\nPatients were enrolled at the Detroit Medical Center/Hutzel Women's Hospital, MI, USA. All provided written informed consent for the collection of clinical data, and biological materials under protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of both Wayne State University and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development of the National Institute of Health (NIH/DHHS). Many of these samples have been employed to study the biology of inflammation (i.e. complement, flow cytometry), hemostasis, angiogenesis regulation, and growth factor concentrations in normal pregnant women and those with complications. Samples from these patients have been used for other studies of the biology of pyelonephritis and inflammation.\n\nA specific and sensitive enzyme-linked immunoassay was used to determine concentrations of CXCL10/IP-10 in human maternal serum. Immunoassays for CXCL10/IP-10 were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). Briefly, maternal serum samples were incubated in duplicate wells of the microtiter plates, pre-coated with monoclonal antibodies specific for CXCL10/IP-10. During this incubation step, any IP-10 present in the standards or maternal serum is bound by the immobilized antibodies. After repeated washing and aspiration to remove all unbound substances, an enzyme-linked polyclonal antibody specific for CXCL10/IP-10 was added to the wells. Following a wash to remove excess and unbound materials, a substrate solution was added to the wells and color developed in proportion to the amount of CXCL10/ IP-10 bound in the initial step. The color development was stopped with the addition of an acid solution and the intensity of color was read using a programmable spectrophotometer (SpectraMax M2, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The concentrations of IP-10 in serum samples were determined by interpolation from individual standard curves composed of recombinant human CXCL10/IP-10. The calculated inter and intra assay coefficients of variation (CVs) for CXCL10/IP-10 immunoassays in our laboratory were 7.99% and 4.12%. The lower limit of detection (sensitivity) was calculated to be 5.01pg/mL.\n\nThe Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was employed to determine whether the data was normally distributed. Comparisons among groups were performed using the Mann-Whitney Test. A pvalue <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The statistical package used was SPSS v. 14.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).\n\nClinical and obstetrical characteristics of women in each group are displayed in Table I Among patients with acute pyelonephritis, no significant difference in the median serum concentration of CXCL10/IP-10 was observed between those who had positive blood cultures and those who did not (positive blood cultures: median 362.6 pg/mL, range 100.2-2459.2 vs. negative blood cultures: median 298.9 pg/mL, range 108.5-1148.7, respectively; p=0.3) ( Figure 2 ).\n\nPatients with acute pyelonephritis delivered neonates with a lower birth weight than those in the control group (pyelonephritis: median 3140.0 g, range 1080-4090 g vs. normal pregnancy: median 3342.5 g, range 2550-4050 g; p=0.02). However, the mean gestational age at delivery was not different between the two groups.\n\nPrincipal findings of this study 1. The median serum concentration of CXCL10/IP-10 in pregnant women with acute pyelonephritis was significantly higher than that of normal pregnant women;\n\n2. among patients with pyelonephritis, no significant difference in the median serum concentration of CXCL10/IP-10 was observed between those who had positive blood cultures and those who did not. This is the first report documenting an increase in the maternal serum concentration of CXCL10/IP-10 in women with an acute infection during pregnancy.\n\nThe superfamily of chemokines includes secreted proteins with a molecular weight of 8-10 kD that selectively target and activate specific cell populations and attract them to inflamed tissues in which microbial invasion has occurred [19, 20, 22, 61, 62] .\n\nUntil recently, there was much discussion about the specificity of subsets of chemokines for a particular leukocyte population (e.g. neutrophils, lymphocytes, etc.), and whether or not a particular set of chemokines was involved in the disease processes with a characteristic type of white blood cell infiltration. Recent findings indicate that chemokines and their receptors are expressed by a wide variety of cells of non-hematopoietic origin, and that the functions of chemokines extend far beyond white blood cell attraction. A fundamental observation, which has added complexity to the field, is the 'promiscuity' of this family of molecules and their receptors. Indeed, chemokines can bind several different receptors, while chemokine receptors can bind more than one chemokine [19] .\n\nTraditionally, two main subfamilies of chemokines have been described on the basis of the number and arrangement of the conserved cystine residues, the CC and the CXC chemokines [19, 20, 22, 61, 62] . The CC chemokines preferentially attract monocytes, basophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes, but have no effect on neutrophils [63] . The CXC chemokines are subdivided according to the presence or absence of the glutamic acid-leucine-arginine (ELR) sequence. ELR-containing CXC chemokines (ELR+) are chemotactic for neutrophils and promoters of angiogenesis. In contrast, non-ELR containing CXC chemokines (ELR-) are chemotactic mainly for lymphocytes, and characterized by anti-angiogenic activity [21, [23] [24] [25] [26] 64, 65] .\n\nIP-10 (CXCL10) is an ELR-CXC chemokine [15] first described as the product of a gene induced in response to recombinant IFN-\u03b3 in several cell populations [28] .\n\nThe biological properties of IP-10 are mediated through the interaction with a trans-membrane G protein-coupled receptor, CXCR3 [66, 67] , shared by two other IFN-\u03b3 inducible CXC chemokines, CXCL9 (MIG) and CXCX11 (ITAC), whose distinct biological activities are related to different signal transduction pathways [68] [69] [70] [71] .\n\nCXCL10/IP-10 gene and protein expression is modulated by pro-inflammatory stimuli. Indeed, IFN\u03b3 is an inducer of the gene and protein expression of this chemokine by mononuclear cells [28] , neutrophils [36, 37] , eosinophils [37, 72] , keratinocytes [28, 31, 32, 34] , fibroblasts [28] , endothelial cells [28] [29] [30] , pancreatic \u03b2cells [38, 39] , and animal astrocytes/microglia [33, 35] . TNF\u03b1 [37, [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] , Interleukin (IL-1\u03b2) [37, 38] , as well as viral [33, 48, 49] and microbial products [37, 47, [50] [51] [52] , can also stimulate the production of IP-10. Interestingly, in vitro infection of epithelium of the urinary tract with E. coli results in an increase (as measured in the conditioned media with ELISA) in both CXCL10/IP-10 secretion and epithelial cells CXCL10/IP-10 mRNA expression [73] . Activation of the NF-kB pathway [48, 49, [53] [54] [55] [56] after ligation of pattern recognition receptors (TLR4 [50] and TLR3 [56] ) can also upregulate gene and protein expression of IP-10. Thus, IP-10 is considered an 'NF-kB responsive gene' [74] .\n\nThe pro-inflammatory activities of CXCL10/IP-10 include chemotaxis and endothelial adhesion of activated T cells [75] , as well as chemotaxis [76] and enhancement of natural killer (NK) cells mediated cytolysis [76] . However, this chemokine is a poor neutrophil activator [75, 77] , and its effects on monocytes [66, 75] , and B cells [78, 79] is a controversial topic.\n\nInfection is associated with an increase in serum and/or plasma concentrations of CXCL10/ IP-10. Evidence in support of this statement includes: (1) median serum concentration of CXCL10/IP-10, determined on the first postnatal day, are significantly higher in neonates with perinatal infections than in controls (p<0.001) [80] ; (2) median serum concentrations of CXCL10/IP-10 are significantly higher in neonates with nosocomial infections as compared to controls [80] ; (3) neonatal plasma IP-10 =1250 pg/mL has been reported to identify all preterm infants with sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis [81] ; (4) it has been proposed that the severity of neonatal infection is associated with the magnitude of upregulation of circulating CXCL10/IP-10. Indeed, CXCL10/IP-10 plasma concentrations in infants who died of sepsis were all markedly elevated (range: 23,817-34,415 pg/ml); [81] ; and (5) in adults, plasma CXCL10/IP-10 concentration has been used to monitor the disease activity and the response to therapy of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection [82] .\n\nInterestingly, serum concentrations of CXCL10/IP-10 have been reported to be significantly higher in those with severe ARDS than in control patients (patients with bacterial pneumonia). Chemokine and cytokine disregulation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ARDS [81, 83, 84] , and CXCL10/IP-10 has been proposed as a useful marker of lung injury in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome [85] .\n\nPrevious studies reported higher serum [86] and urine [86, 87] CXCL10/IP-10 concentrations (determined by ELISA) in the presence of both culture-proven Gram-negative urosepsis [86] and febrile urinary tract infections than in control patients [73, 87] . Furthermore, serum CXCL10/IP-10 concentrations did not change significantly during the follow-up (72 h after beginning of treatment). However, a significant decrease in the urinary concentrations was observed [86] . In serum and in urine, CXCL10/IP-10 concentrations were not different in patients with positive or negative blood cultures [86, 87] . Of interest is that in experimental endotoxemia in humans, CXCL10/IP-10 concentrations were elevated in both serum and urine [86] . The finding of increased concentrations in urine, raises questions about how the changes in the peripheral circulation are reflected in urine. It is possible that this reflects renal excretion of increased available CXCL10/IP-10 in the peripheral circulation, local production or both.\n\nThis is the first report on the topic of serum CXCL10/IP-10 concentrations in pregnant women with pyelonephritis. Our finding that pyelonephritis in pregnancy is associated with a significant increase in the serum concentration of this chemokine is consistent with what has been previously reported in non-pregnant patients [86] . The mechanisms responsible for the increase in CXCL10/IP-10 during normal pregnancy [88] , and in acute infection during gestation are unknown. In addition, the physiologic function of CXCL10/IP-10 during pregnancy as well as the role of CXCL10/IP-10 in acute infection during gestation remains to be determined. Recently, it has been demonstrated that CXCL10/IP-10 has antimicrobial properties [89] . Thus, it is tempting to postulate that this chemokine participates in host defense not only by orchestrating leukocyte chemotaxis, but also by inducing other biological activities which may have a protective effect during infection. In this study, no significant differences were observed in the median maternal serum concentrations of CXCL10/IP-10 between patients with and without positive blood cultures. Otto et al. [87] reported similar results when quantifying urinary CXCL10 in response to febrile urinary tract infections. Indeed, only some chemokines such as CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL8, and CCL2, but not CXCL10/IP-10, were significantly higher in the presence of bacteremia. One interpretation is that the elevation in the serum concentration of CXCL10/IP-10 in the context of pyelonephritis results from systemic inflammation and it is not affected by the presence of microorganisms in the circulation. However, one possible explanation for this negative result is a limited statistical power.\n\nMigration of immunocompetent cells to sites of mucosal infection requires expression of molecules by the epithelial cells of the affected tissues [90] . Chemokines, particularly those belonging to the CXC family, have been shown to play an important role in this process [20, [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] . Indeed, infections of the mucosae are associated with a local increase in CXCL10/ IP-10. Evidence in support of this statement includes: 1) exposure of uro-epithelial cells to E. coli is followed by a significant increase in CXCL10/IP-10 mRNA expression (quantification with an RNA protection assay) and protein secretion (ELISA ) [73] ; 2) intravesical instillation of Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is followed by detection of urinary CXCL10/IP-10 in patients undergoing immunotherapy for bladder cancer (by ELISA) [95, 96] ; 3) conditioned media collected from culture of human uroepithelial cell lines exposed to BCG or BCG-derived cytokines such as IFN\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF\u03b1 contains a significantly higher amount of CXCL10/IP-10 (ELISA) than control media [95] ; and 4) intrapulmonary administration of pneumoniae in mice is followed by upregulation of CXCL10/IP-10 mRNA expression in the lung. Moreover, neutralization of CXCL10/IP-10 activity with an antibody results in reduced bacterial clearance and decreased survival, while, in contrast, overexpression of CXCL10/IP-10 (via adenovirus) results in improved bacterial clearance [97] .\n\nRecent studies have reported structural similarities between chemokines and defensins (a family of antimicrobial peptides serving as the first line of defense in epithelia before the activation of adaptive immunity) [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] . The following evidence suggests an overlap between the biological functions of defensins and CXCL10/IP-10: (1) chemokines share many properties with defensins such as structure, size, charge, disulfide bonding, and IFNinducibility [89] ; (2) the CXC motif, present in CXCL10/IP-10, is contained and conserved in \u03b1-defensins-1 and -2; these defensins, as well as a structurally related \u03b2-defensin, have been shown to be chemotactic for leukocytes at subnanomolar concentrations [106] [107] [108] [109] ; (3) CXCL10/IP-10 has antimicrobial properties similar to those of defensins: in a radial diffusion assay, CXCL10/IP-10 has been demonstrated to have antimicrobial activity against E. coli and Listeria monocytogenes [89] . Moreover, this antimicrobial activity, similarly to the activity of defensins and many other antimicrobial peptides [110] , is salt dependent (inhibited by NaCl) [89] ; and (4) calculations of the amount of CXCL10/IP-10 produced by infiltrating inflammatory cells indicate that the tissue concentrations of this chemokines may reach the threshold necessary for microbicidal activity locally and directly inactivate microbes before attracting other host defense cells to the area [89] .\n\nCompared to non-pregnant subjects with pyelonephritis, mothers with pyeloneprhtis are at an increased risk for ARDS [7, [12] [13] [14] [111] [112] [113] [114] [115] . This has been attributed to an enhanced baseline activation of the innate immunoresponse during pregnancy [116, 117] , although other explanations may be possible [118] . Indeed, an excessive inflammatory response (in particular neutrophil activation) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ARDS [118] . Nevertheless, the precise mechanism for the association between pyelonephritis and ARDS remains to be determined. Neumann et al. [119] caused lung injury in female mice by inducing continuous leakage of bacteria into the peritoneal cavity. The investigators demonstrated that this procedure causes, in as early as three hours, massive recruitment of granulocytes to the lung and a significant increase in lung CXCL10/IP-10 mRNA.\n\nThe authors concluded that CXCL10/IP-10 may contribute to the accumulation of mononuclear phagocytes in the lung [119] . Thus, CXCL10/IP-10 may be involved in the pathogenesis of ARDS in pregnant women with sepsis and/or pyelonephritis. This hypothesis is strengthened by the observation that, in patients with SARS, the serum concentrations of CXCL10/IP-10 increase before the development of chest involvement, reaching a peak concentration before abnormalities are detected in the chest X-ray [85] .\n\nMaternal serum concentrations of CXCL10/IP-10 are higher in the context of acute bacterial infection (pyelonephritis) than in normal pregnancy. The role of this chemokine in host defense during infection requires further study. Maternal serum concentrations of CXCL10/IP-10 in patients with pyelonephritis. No significant differences in maternal median serum concentrations of CXCL10/IP-10 were observed between patients with positive and negative blood cultures (median: 362.6 pg/mL, range: 100.2-2459.2 vs. median: 298.9 pg/mL, range: 108.5-1148.7, respectively; p=0.3)."}
