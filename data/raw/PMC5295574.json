{"title": "Myopericarditis: A Diagnosis of Uncertainty", "body": "As an acute inflammatory disease that mainly impacts the myocardium, acute myopericarditis can be caused by viruses, systemic conditions, drugs, or toxins. Pericarditis and myocarditis at times can present together and coexist as they share common underlying causes such as coxsackievirus [1-3]. The dilemma arises however in the diagnosis of this disorder as it mimics myocardial infarction and in this case report also had features of acute aortic dissection and pulmonary embolism. Few reports have demonstrated myopericarditis presenting not only as acute myocardial infarction but also a symptomatic picture suggesting aortic dissection.\n\nA 52-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking presented to the emergency room with complaints of chest pain, insidious in onset, and getting progressively worse. The pain was relieved when lying on his back and radiated to the left side of his chest, arm, and upper back. The patient stated the pain was a 10/10 and felt like a tearing pain down his back. Initially, patient believed the symptoms were secondary to acid reflux and took Tums. Overnight, the symptoms failed to resolve and he thus presented to the hospital. Patient denied any palpitations but had shortness of breath upon deep inhalation.\n\nVital signs demonstrated a blood pressure of 159/89, heart rate of 107, respiratory rate of 19, temperature of 98 \u00b0F, and pulse oximetry of 93% saturation. Physical examination findings were significant for only chest wall tenderness upon palpation and the patient was in clear distress and discomfort secondary to the severity of his chest and back pain. No friction rub was evident. Initial laboratory data showed a hemoglobin of 14.1, hematocrit of 43.1, white blood cell count of 10.4, and platelets of 230. Basic metabolic panel illustrated a sodium of 140, potassium of 4.4, chloride of 98, bicarbonate of 30, blood urea nitrogen of 24, creatinine of 1.7, and glucose of 99. His CKMB was 9.41 and his first troponin was elevated at 11.54. EKG (Fig. 1) illustrated ST elevations in multiple leads and thus Code Heart was called and patient was taken for cardiac catheterization.\n\nCardiac catheterization revealed patent arteries and no occlusions were noted (Fig. 2). Post catheterization, patient continued to remain tachycardic and in significant distress from back pain. Aortic dissection and pulmonary embolism remained in the differentials at the time. Due to an elevated creatinine, a ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan was conducted while intravenous hydration was given. V/Q scan demonstrated indeterminate probability of pulmonary embolism. The following day with improvement in his creatinine, the patient underwent computed tomography angiography (CTA), which concluded that there was negative for dissection or embolism (Fig. 3). The clinical picture of the patient over the next few days improved with the use of NSAIDs. Serology later returned suggesting the presence of Coxsackie B virus.\n\nTo summarize, patients with myocarditis present with several symptoms, clinical and laboratory findings that may coincide with other diagnoses such as ischemia. In our case report, due to the severity of the patient\u2019s presentation, significant back pain, tachycardia, respiratory distress, and other diagnoses such as aortic dissection and pulmonary embolism also need to be excluded. Thus, awareness of myocarditis presenting similar to these other conditions, can help physicians avoid unnecessary examinations and rapidly correct the underlying cause to prevent long-term risks. However, it is vital to keep other conditions in mind as the risk of long-term complications can be detrimental to a patient\u2019s outcome."}
