{"title": "Following translation by single ribosomes one codon at a time NIH Public Access NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript The effect of force on translation rates", "body": "the time the ribosome spends at each codon, the number of mRNA nucleotides that move through the ribosome in each translocation step, and the time required per step. We have also determined the effects of mRNA structure on step size and rate, and have studied the effects of internal Shine-Dalgarno sequences 19 on translation arrest. These experiments provide a dynamic picture of the movement of a messenger RNA through a ribosome.\n\nIn these experiments, we used a single mRNA hairpin with a ribosome stalled at the 5\u2032 end by omission of a required aminoacyl-tRNA; the RNA was attached to two micrometre-sized beads by RNA-DNA handles. One of the beads was held on a micropipette and the other in an optical trap used to measure the changes in distance between the beads (in nanometres) and the forces applied to the hairpin (in piconewtons) (Fig. 1A) 20-22 . Translation is resumed at the singlemolecule level by adding a mixture containing the required aminoacyl-tRNAs. During translation, the ribosome opens the hairpin as it moves through the RNA; thus, each base translocated requires the breaking of a base pair, which corresponds to an increase in the endto-end distance of the mRNA by about 1 nm at the forces involved in these experiments (15-20 pN) 23 . Translation can thus be followed in real time by monitoring these changes in distance.\n\nTo establish that translation occurred in a single molecule of RNA held in the optical tweezers apparatus, we used a 60-base-pair (bp) hairpin that contains unique codons where the ribosome can be stalled (S3hp; see a in Fig. 1B ). The progress of translation was established by determining the size of the residual hairpin, through its mechanical unfolding (details presented in Supplementary Information and Supplementary Fig. 1 ). To verify that the change in hairpin size was caused by a stalled ribosome at the corresponding position on the hairpin, we flowed a ribosome-releasing mixture containing puromycin (see Methods) into the reaction chamber. After a few minutes, the hairpin fully refolded, indicating that the ribosome had been released. These control experiments established that an RNA duplex can be unwound by the ribosome as translation proceeds, and that a ribosome can be stably stalled on the RNA at a chosen position.\n\nWe also translated the mRNA in bulk in the absence of force (using Escherichia coli S100 enzymes, see Supplementary information). The 60-bp S3hp mRNA and its corresponding wildtype ribosomal S3 mRNA were translated completely, but the hairpin RNA was translated approximately 40% slower (see Supplementary Fig. 2 ). These results show that ribosomes can translate long helices as used in our experiments, even without the aid of force to unfold them.\n\nTo follow translation by single ribosomes in real time, we designed another 60-bp hairpin construct, VE60hp, whose first 15 codons in the hairpin region encode only valine (Val) and glutamic acid (Glu), preceded by two phenylalanine codons (Phe) to allow ribosome stalling (see b in Fig. 1B) . The hairpin with a ribosome stalled at the Phe codon was held at a constant force of 20 pN-a force below that required to unfold the hairpin (approximately 23 pN, see Supplementary Fig. 3) , and the extension change was monitored in time. As expected, hairpin unwinding was not observed before a translation mixture was injected into the reaction chamber to resume elongation. The extension and force trajectories versus time obtained in the presence of the translation mixture are shown in Fig. 2a . Strikingly, the extension shows a repeated steppause-step pattern. These patterns display clear and discrete transitions (indicated by arrows). The steps were quantitatively analysed by calculating the corresponding pairwise distance distributions 23 , as shown in Fig. 2b . The distance between steps is 2.7 nm, which corresponds to six nucleotides at 20 pN; that is, the breaking of three hairpin base pairs accompanying a translocation step of three bases. Thus, we identified these transitions as ribosomal steps corresponding to the translation of individual codons. Figure 2c shows a step-pause-step trajectory defining the translocation time, the dwell time (the time between successive steps) and the pause time (the time between translocation events) of one such cycle. Direct analysis of the translocation events (number of events, n = 121) during translation of VE60hp gives a step size of 2.94 \u00b1 0.72 bases occurring in 0.078 \u00b1 0.045 s.\n\nAlthough in our assay we directly observe the opening of hairpin base pairs and the release of the single-strand chains due to the helicase activity of the ribosome, and not its actual translocation, it is noteworthy that the ribosome opens exactly three base pairs, corresponding to the translation of each codon. The most parsimonious interpretation of this observation is that unwinding and translocation are strictly coupled functions and occur simultaneously; that is, within 0.078 s. Accordingly, we refer here to the transitions observed as translocations. These results constitute the first direct real-time observation, to our knowledge, of the physical steps of the ribosome machine moving along the mRNA during translation.\n\nWe used a third mRNA construct (VE274hp; see c in Fig. 1C ) harbouring a 274-bp hairpin with patches of Val and Glu codons to improve the statistics of translation dynamics. To follow translation on this longer messenger, we used a dual-trap optical tweezer instrument in which the pipette holding the bottom bead shown in Fig. 1A was replaced by a second optical trap. This instrument provided lower drift that improved data collection during the longer times required to translate this mRNA. However, as expected, the longer RNA also introduced more high-frequency noise.\n\nTranslation of VE274hp began by stalling the ribosome at the first Glu codon (E20; see c in Fig. 1B ) of the hairpin. The RNA was held at an initial force of 17-18 pN before flowing the translation mixture (containing purified Val-tRNA Val and Glu-tRNA Glu ) into the chamber to resume elongation. As the reaction proceeded, opening of the hairpin by the translating ribosome resulted in an increase in RNA extension, and a corresponding decrease in force 24 , because the two laser beams of the dual-trap tweezers were held fixed during the experiments ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ).\n\nAs seen in Fig. 3a , translation dynamics is a complex process, which is different for each reaction. The four translation trajectories shown in Fig. 3a were obtained for different ribosomes under the same reaction conditions, but the patterns vary significantly. Apart from runs of active translation, these trajectories also show variable overall translation rates, the existence of long pauses of variable lengths and locations, and positions where translation stopped altogether. Nonetheless, close-up views of active translation trajectories from different reactions (Fig. 3b) show the characteristic translocation-pause-translocation pattern with threebase steps, or multiples of them.\n\nOnly a small fraction of ribosomes (n = 4 out of 29) reach the last Glu patch (labelled E5; see, for example, Fig. 3a , blue trace) of the VE274hp. Most trajectories end earlier; we define these early halting events as 'translation arrests'. Figure 3c summarizes the positions of translation arrests in the VE274hp construct (underlying blue bars). One-third (9 out of 29) of the ribosomes stopped at a region (positions 67-75) that occurs just downstream from a Shine-Dalgarno-like AGGAGG sequence (positions 56-61, Fig. 3c ). Moreover, another internal Shine-Dalgarno sequence (positions 167-172) also seems to favour translational arrests. To test the effects of internal Shine-Dalgarno sequences on translation, the first Shine-Dalgarno sequence AG GAG G in VE274hp was changed to AA GAA G; note that the new codons are recognized by the same isotype of tRNA Glu and the amino-acid sequence is maintained. On this mutant hairpin, VE274hp-G2A, the translation arrest downstream of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (positions 67-75) has now disappeared (underlying red bars, Fig. 3c ). These results suggest that translating ribosomes can be stalled by base pairing between the 3\u2032 end of 16S rRNA and internal Shine-Dalgarno sequences in the mRNA, similar to the interaction during the initiation process. A recent report shows that the Shine-Dalgarno interaction increases the rupture force of the ribosome from the bound mRNA by 10 pN 25 . The arrests observed in the vicinity of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence in our experiments indicate that this extra binding energy, together with the downstream hairpin structure, is sufficient to block the movement of the ribosome.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 3a , active translation runs made up of translocation-pause-translocation cycles are eventually interrupted by longer pauses, which can last up to 1-2 min ( Supplementary Fig.  5 ). The long pauses occur less often in the first valine patch (V1) than in succeeding ones ( Supplementary Fig. 6a ). These long pauses can be identified from the derivatives of the individual translation trajectories (that is, the derivatives of the traces in Fig. 3a ; one is shown in Supplementary Fig. 6b ). The valleys between peaks on such plots characterize the long pauses, whereas the peaks on the plot correspond to active translation runs. These peaks show a relatively constant rate of 0.45 \u00b1 0.17 codons per second, corresponding to a mean dwell time of 2.2 s (n = 43 ribosomes); these short pauses, we surmise, represent the constitutive (intrinsic) pauses of a translating ribosome.\n\nThe kinetics of translation have been studied in bulk 12 , and in single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments 17,18 ; the rates of the rate-determining (slowest) steps are of order 1-10 s -1 . In single-molecule experiments, the distribution of lifetimes for a species depends on the number and rates of the molecular events that transform that species into another. If a single stochastic event determines the lifetime, the distribution of lifetimes follows a single exponential decay from the smallest lifetimes to the longest lifetimes. For two or more successive reactions the distribution has a maximum at intermediate values of the lifetimes (see Supplementary Information) 26,27 . We analysed the dwell times-the times between successive steps-during translation of the first 15 valines in the VE274hp sequence. We found that these times for an actively translating subset of ribosomes (mean dwell time approximately 2 s) are not exponentially distributed. Instead, the data (n = 180) can be fitted well (R 2 = 0.93) to a difference of two exponentials (Fig. 4a) . To ensure that our choice of ribosomes had not biased the results, we also analysed different subsets, and all the ribosomes. A difference of two exponentials was needed to fit each distribution, although the values of the rate constants, k, differed for each distribution. These results indicate that two, or more, successive rate-limiting processes control the dwell times between steps.\n\nBy contrast, and surprisingly, the distribution of translocation times for VE60hp best fits an equation (see Supplementary Information) with three identical substeps, with a mean lifetime of each of the three substeps of 0.025 \u00b1 0.002 s (k = 40 s -1 ) (Fig. 2d) . This result indicates that multiple processes with similar kinetics underlie the translocation step of three nucleotides. Until now, no technique has allowed characterization of the dynamics of ribosome stepping to this degree of detail. The kinetic processes we identified here could involve, for example, steps in the unlocking rearrangement of the ribosome 28 ; or it is also possible that the ribosome moves over the length of one codon with three consecutive, equally timed, singlebase substeps. Figure 3a shows that translation dynamics (overall rates, see Supplementary Fig. 7 , and extents of reactions) are different for each ribosome. However, recurrence of Val patches on VE274hp allowed us to investigate, on the same ribosome, the effect of the force applied to the hairpin. Figure 4b shows that the lengths of pauses increase-translation rates decrease-when the force dropped as translation proceeded from Val segment 1 to 4 (V1-V4). The distributions of dwell times show that decreasing the force (16 to 9 pN) decreases the faster rate constant of the two substeps by a factor of three. At lower forces, the energy barrier impeding strand separation increases, resulting in slower translation rates and longer dwell times. This suggests that a paused ribosome could be rescued by raising the force applied on the ends of the hairpin. This is indeed the case, as shown in Fig. 4c , where raising the force from 10 pN to 18 pN caused translation to immediately resume. Similar force-rescued translations were observed in about one-third of the long-paused ribosomes (14 events in 40 trials). Thus, some of the longer pauses observed in these experiments may be accounted for by the mechanical barriers imposed on the ribosome by the secondary structure of the mRNA.\n\nSurprisingly, the force applied to the hairpin affects only the pause times; there is no detectable change in the translocation times. This observation implies that the rate-limiting step for translocation in our experiments corresponds to an intermediate state of the mRNA-tRNAribosome complex whose attainment is prevented, in part, by an activation barrier that is lowered by the force applied to the ends of the RNA. Once the complex has cleared this barrier, helix opening (and translocation) occurs rapidly and independently of force.\n\nWe have successfully applied optical tweezers to follow translation by single ribosomes in real time along individual molecules of mRNA. These studies have revealed for the first time that translation occurs not in a continuous manner, but as a series of translocation-pausetranslocation events. These intrinsic short pauses, displayed by actively translating ribosomes, have durations that range from a fraction of a second to a few seconds; their mean is 2.2 s. In addition, we observe pauses that are significantly longer, lasting from tens of seconds up to 1-2 min. By contrast, the translocation steps, lasting for less than 0.1 s, were independent of the experimental variables we studied. The ability to measure the time spent at each codon (dwells) and the time required to move to the next codon (translocations) will make it possible to correlate biochemical results obtained in bulk studies with the dynamics of translation at a specific step or substep.\n\nThe ubiquitous long pauses observed in these studies may play a role in translation regulation in vivo, and can lead to translational frameshifting 29 and to protein misfolding 30 . A recent cryo-electron microscopy study on frameshifting suggests that mRNA pseudoknots cause conformational changes in the ribosome that create tension on the mRNA, which in turn results in -1 frameshifting 16 . Pauses caused by the increased barriers as ribosomes move through a hairpin 31 , as in these experiments, can also lead to frameshifting.\n\nWe find that internal Shine-Dalgarno sequences tend to stop translation, presumably by binding to 16S rRNA during long pauses. The ability to measure dwell times at each codon opens the way to understanding the mechanism of translational regulation involving internal Shine-Dalgarno sequences, such as in the expression of the prfB and dnaX genes in E. coli 29 . The mRNA transcripts of these genes both contain internal Shine-Dalgarno sequences, and can lead to +1 or -1 frameshifts.\n\nThe studies on hairpins described here mimic biologically relevant situations of translation. Messenger RNAs are expected to have roughly half of their bases paired 32,33 , mostly in short hairpins (5-10 bp), but more stable structures, including pseudoknots, are not uncommon. Future efforts should concentrate on single-molecule translation using less structured templates similar to naturally occurring mRNAs, and on measuring the translation signal directly by tethering the ribosome as it moves along the mRNA. By forming tethers 34 to the ribosome and the end of the linear mRNA, it will be possible to investigate the motor properties of the ribosome: that is, its stall force and its force-velocity relation. These properties can provide further insight into the mechanism of energy transduction of this essential cellular machine.\n\nThe stalling translation mixtures were used to stall the ribosome at designated positions on the mRNA. In general, the following components were mixed in 50 \u03bcl of Buffer TL: 2 mM ATP, 1 mM GTP, 5 mM PEP (phosphoenol pyruvate), 1 OD total tRNA mixture, 24 \u03bcM EF-Tu, 4 \u03bcM EF-G, 0.02 mg ml -1 pyruvate kinase (Roche), 1 \u03bcl DEAE-purified S-100 enzymes, 40 U RNAguard (RNase inhibitor; Amersham) and amino-acid mixture containing 0.1 mM of each amino acid. Buffer TL contained: 40 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 60 mM NH 4 Cl, 10 mM Mg (OAc) 2 , 1 mM DTT and 3.6 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. The components of the amino-acid mixture depended on the experiment. For example, to stall the ribosome at the arginine R11 of S3hp, the amino acids used were G, Q, K, V, H, P, N, and I (see a in Fig. 1B) . The 50-\u03bcl mixture was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 15 min and on ice for 5 min, and then diluted with three volumes of Buffer TL containing 1 mM GTP.\n\nTo make the initiation complex, the mRNA hairpin constructs (0.2 \u03bcM) were mixed with 1 mM GTP, 4 \u03bcM each of IF1, IF2, IF3, fMet-tRNA fMet , and the 70S ribosome in 10 \u03bcl Buffer TL. The mixture was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 15 min. Elongation was performed by mixing 1 \u03bcl initiation complex and 9 \u03bcl stalling translation mixture and incubating at 37 \u00b0C for 2-5 min. The reaction was used to stall the ribosome at the designated position on the mRNA. Finally, the mixture was diluted with 20 volumes of cold Buffer TL to prepare it for tweezer experiments.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.\n\nConfiguration of the single-trap tweezers has been described previously 36, 37 . Configuration of the dual-trap tweezers was similar to that described by Moffitt et al. 35 , except that a 1064nm laser was used. The E. coli MRE600 ribosomes 38 , initiation factors (IF1, IF2 and IF3) 39 , EF-G 40 , EF-Tu 41 and S-100 enzymes 42 were purified as per protocols described in the literature. The ribosomes and proteins were made in small aliquots and stored at -80 \u00b0C.\n\nThe plasmids used in the experiments were originally constructed from pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene). A 769-bp E. coli ribosomal S3 gene 43 was inserted between XbaI and NotI sites, and a 619-bp PCR fragment (from pBR322) was inserted into the KpnI site, between the T7 promoter sequence and the S3 gene fragment, to serve as the 5\u2032 handle. To make pS3hp (for S3hp mRNA, see a in Fig. 1B) , a 107-bp dsDNA was inserted between NcoI and BsrGI sites (inside the S3 gene), such that the sequence for codons 13-32 of S3 was base-paired to the inserted downstream sequence. pVE60hp (for VE60hp mRNA, see b in Fig. 1B) was derived from pS3hp. A 158-bp dsDNA was inserted to pS3hp between NdeI and BsrGI sites to replace the existing hairpin completely.\n\npVE274hp (for VE274hp mRNA, see c in Fig. 1B) was derived from pVE60hp and constructed in several steps. Oligonucleotide A (60-base oligonucleotide), pGAAGAAGTG (GTN) 14 GAAGAGGAG (p = phosphate, N = A, G, C or T; encoding Glu 2 Val 15 Glu 3 ), was annealed to an 18-base oligonucleotide connector, CACTTCTTCCTCCTCTTC, which was used to align multiple copies of oligonucleotide A in tandem, followed by ligation. To introduce primer sequences and functional sites, oligonucleotide B (CCATGGAACAAGCTGAGGAATCAAACGTTCTTC) and oligonucleotide C (CGGCCGCCGCCCTAGGGGCTGGCTTTCGCCAGCCCTTTAGTGAGGGTTAATT) were ligated to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sides, respectively. The ligated products were subjected to PCR (primers: TAGGATccatggAACAAGCTGAGGAATCAAACG and AAGGCCtgtacaAATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGCTGG, NcoI and BsrGI sites are shown in lower case, respectively) and then inserted to pVE60hp between NcoI and BsrGI, replacing the existing hairpin sequence. The cloned sequences were dominated by two copies of oligonucleotide A. The oligonucleotide A regions from two clones were subjected to PCR and ligated to make a construct with essentially four copies of oligonucleotide A (called pRC4). To make a hairpin, the oligonucleotide A region of pRC4 was subjected to PCR (primers: GGACATCCTAATtgtacaAACAAGCTGAGGAATCAAACGTTCTTT and GCTTGTTAggtctcCCTAGGGAAACCTAGGGCGGCGGCCGCTCC, BsrGI and BsaI sites are shown in lower case, respectively; the latter creates a cohesive end compatible to AvrII), and inserted to pRC4 between AvrII and BsrGI, downstream of the oligonucleotide A region. Note that the insertion is in an inverted (tail-to-tail) orientation, such that the insert is complementary to the oligonucleotide A region. RNA was synthesized in vitro with these plasmids with T7 RNA polymerase (Ambion). The synthesized RNA was purified by MEGAclear purification kit (Ambion) and stored at -30 \u00b0C.\n\nPurified tRNAs (tRNA Val , tRNA Glu , tRNA Phe and tRNA fMet ) were purchased from Sigma. Total tRNA mixtures were purchased from Sigma and Roche. tRNAs were aminoacylated using DEAE-purified S-100 enzymes 38 and extracted with phenol/chloroform. The efficiency of aminoacylation for purified tRNAs was checked by acid gel electrophoresis 44 . Because of the heterogeneity, the efficiency of aminoacylation for the total tRNA mixtures cannot be determined from the gel.\n\nThe translation mixtures prepared here were used to inject into the reaction chamber to resume translation for the stalled ribosome-mRNA complexes. In general, the following components were mixed in a total of 45 \u03bcl of Buffer TL: 1 mM GTP, 5 mM PEP, 26.7 \u03bcM EF-Tu, and 0.02 mg ml -1 pyruvate kinase. The mixture was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 15 min. Then 5 \u03bcl of Val-tRNA Val , Glu-tRNA Glu and Phe-tRNA Phe (each with specified concentrations) were added, incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 5 min, and on ice for 5 min. The reaction was diluted with 350 \u03bcl (total 400 \u03bcl) Buffer TL containing 1 mM GTP, 1 mM ATP, 40 U RNAguard and 1 or 0.1 \u03bcM EF-G (final concentrations). Finally, the mixture was filtered (0.22 \u03bcm, low protein binding, MILLEX-GV, Durapore membrane, Millipore) and put on ice.\n\nThe ribosome-releasing mixture was used for control experiments to release the ribosome from the stalled ribosome-mRNA complex. The mixture contained the following components in 400 \u03bcl Buffer TL: 0.5 mM puromycin, 1 mM GTP, 0.25 \u03bcM EF-G, 1 \u03bcl DEAE-purified S-100 enzymes, and 40 U RNAguard.\n\nTo facilitate data analysis, the extension (end-to-end distance) changes of the VE274hp (or VE274hp-G2A) RNA during translation were converted to the number of bases translocated by the ribosome (base pairs broken), by an empirical method. The force-extension curves before translation were fitted to a worm-like chain (WLC) model 24 to obtain the basal WLC curve. A series of curves that mimicked the RNA elasticity corresponding to individual translation steps were calculated. This was done by adding six-nucleotide (three base pairs broken) components each time to the preceding WLC curves, starting from the basal WLC curve. This series of WLC curves was used to calculate the extension change for each step during translation with the consideration of gradual force decreasing. The theoretical relation between the number of bases translocated and extension change was well fitted to a double exponential equation. Finally, the fitted parameters were used to convert the experimentally measured extension change to the number of bases translocated. This empirical method worked well. For example, the force-extension curve after translation in Supplementary Fig. 3a (green trace) shows no apparent rips, suggesting that none or little residual hairpin was left. The converted translation trajectory (the blue trace in Fig. 3a) shows that the ribosome was stalled close to the apical loop of the hairpin, consistent with the experimental data.\n\nThe translation trajectories (number of bases translocated versus time; see Fig. 3a) were analysed by placing a moving window in the region corresponding to a translated Val patch. The window size was adjusted to cover 21 bp (seven codons, about half of a Val patch). The slope from linear regression for the data points in the window was recorded. The window was then moved to scan the whole region in the patch. The translation rate in this Val patch was finally assigned to the maximum slope. The same procedures were repeated for other translated Val patches on the trace.\n\nThe 200 Hz unsmoothed extension trajectories obtained from the single-trap tweezers were analysed by placing a variable window around a translocation region corresponding to a single step. The window size was varied from 0.025 to 0.50 s, and the linear regression of the 5-100 points in the interval was calculated. The translocation time was assigned to the window size that best fitted a line with the maximum R 2 value. The distribution (0.5 s bins) is well fitted to a mechanism in which two consecutive reactions take place (red line), with k 1 = 0.7 \u00b1 0.2 s -1 , k 2 = 3.4 \u00b1 1.8 s -1 and R 2 = 0.93. b, Force effect on dwell times. The median dwell times in each Val patch are plotted as a function of force (mean force in each Val patch, V1-V4). Data points from the same ribosomes are connected by lines. c, Force effect on long pauses. In this example, the translation paused when the force dropped to about 10 pN. After approximately 1 min of pausing, the force was rapidly raised to 18 pN, and the translation resumed immediately."}
