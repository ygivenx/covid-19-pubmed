{"title": "Organic Carbamates in Drug\nDesign and Medicinal Chemistry", "body": "Carbamate-bearing\nmolecules play an important role in modern drug\ndiscovery and medicinal chemistry. Organic carbamates (or urethanes)\nare structural elements of many approved therapeutic agents. Structurally,\nthe carbamate functionality is related to amide-ester hybrid features\nand, in general, displays very good chemical and proteolytic stabilities.\nCarbamates are widely utilized as a peptide bond surrogate in medicinal\nchemistry. This is mainly due to their chemical stability and capability\nto permeate cell membranes. Another unique feature of carbamates is\ntheir ability to modulate inter- and intramolecular interactions with\nthe target enzymes or receptors. The carbamate functionality imposes\na degree of conformational restriction due to the delocalization of\nnonbonded electrons on nitrogen into the carboxyl moiety. In addition,\nthe carbamate functionality participates in hydrogen bonding through\nthe carboxyl group and the backbone NH. Therefore, substitution on\nthe O- and N-termini of a carbamate offers opportunities for modulation\nof biological properties and improvement in stability and pharmacokinetic\nproperties.\n\nCarbamates have been manipulated for use in the\ndesign of prodrugs\nas a means of achieving first-pass and systemic hydrolytic stability.\nCarbamate derivatives are widely represented in agricultural chemicals,\nsuch as pesticides, fungicides, and herbicides. They play a major\nrole in the chemical and paint industry as starting materials, intermediates,\nand solvents. Furthermore, organic carbamates serve a very important\nrole as optimum protecting groups for amines and amino acids in organic\nsynthesis and peptide chemistry.\n\nIn recent years, carbamate\nderivatives have received much attention\ndue to their application in drug design and discovery. However, there\nare hardly any reviews on this subject in the literature. In the present\nPerspective, we plan to provide an overview of the leading role of\norganic carbamates in medicinal chemistry, with particular focus on\ntherapeutic carbamates and carbamate-based prodrugs. In this context,\nwe will highlight the chemical methodologies adopted for the synthesis\nof these carbamate derivatives. Also, we will outline successful designs\nof organic carbamates, including a variety of cyclic ether-derived\ncarbamates, as suitable amide bond surrogates leading to a wide range\nof novel organic carbamates as potent HIV-1 protease, \u03b2-secretase,\nserine protease, and cysteine protease inhibitors. This information\nmay be useful in further design of carbamate-based molecules as drugs\nor prodrugs.\n\nPeptide-based molecules are an\nimportant starting point for drug\ndiscovery, especially in the design of enzyme inhibitors. Because\nof their high affinity and specificity toward biological functions,\npeptide-based molecules also serve as valuable research tools. However,\nthe poor in vivo stability, inadequate pharmacokinetic\nproperties, and low bioavailability have generally limited their broader\nutility. Hence, a variety of peptide mimics are being developed to\nimprove drug-like character along with increased potency, target specificity,\nand longer duration of action.1\u22123 To this end, several classes of\npeptidomimetics are tailored by replacing the native amide bond with\nunnatural linkages4\u22126 such as retro-amide,7 urea,8\u221212 carbamate,13 and heterocycles14,15 as peptide bond surrogates. These functionalities confer metabolic\nstability toward aminopeptidases, the enzymes involved in the metabolism\nof peptide-like drugs. The carbamate\u2019s emerging role in medicinal\nchemistry is also due to its chemical stability and to its capability\nto increase permeability across cellular membranes. These attributes\nof organic carbamates have been exploited in drug design. As a result,\nthe carbamate motif is becoming the choice for peptide bond surrogates.\n\nOther uses of carbamates are well-known. Particularly, the employment\nof carbamates in various industries as agrochemicals, in the polymer\nindustry, and also in peptide syntheses.16\u221218 In addition,\namong the various amine-protecting groups, carbamates are commonly\nused to enhance their chemical stability toward acids, bases, and\nhydrogenation.19\n\nOne important feature\nof organic carbamates is represented by the\namide resonance. The amide resonance in carbamates has been studied\nin detail employing both experimental and theoretical methods by estimating\nthe C\u2013N bond rotational barriers.20\u221225 The amide resonance in carbamates has been shown to be about 3\u20134\nkcal mol\u20131 lower than those of amides, owing to\nthe steric and electronic perturbations due to the additional oxygen.26 Three possible resonance structures (A, B, and\nC, Figure 1) contribute to the stabilization\nof the carbamate moiety.\n\nCarbamate motifs are characterized\nby a pseudo double bond. This\nimplies the potential deconjugation of the heteroatom-(\u03c3-bond)-carbon-(\u03c0-bond)-heteroatom\nsystem that restricts the free rotation about the formal single \u03c3-bond.\nTherefore, two isomers, syn and anti, may coexist in carbamates (Figure 2).23,27\n\nAlthough carbamates\ndisplay close similarity to amides, they show\npreference for the anti-isomer conformation.28 The anti rotamer is usually\nfavored by 1.0\u20131.5 kcal mol\u20131 for steric\nand electrostatic reasons with respect to the syn counterpart.22 In many cases, the energy\ndifference may be close to zero. As a result, those carbamates are\nfound as an approximately 50:50 mixture of syn and anti isomers, as in the case of a number of Boc-protected\namino acid derivatives. This issue is of key importance since this\nbalanced rotamer equilibria and the low activation energies render\ncarbamates as optimal conformational switches in molecular devices.23\n\nThe influence of the R and R1 substituents on the free-energy\ndifference between the two conformations has been investigated. Beyond\nsteric effects, electronegativity of R1 must be considered\nsince it may affect the conformation in many ways, including changes\nin the dipole moment and bond angles.28 Only the anti conformation would be expected in\nfive-, six-, and seven-membered cyclic carbamates. Calculations of\nthe dipole moment for the carbamate group support this expectation.29 Solvent, concentration, salts, and pH strongly\ninfluence the free energy difference of the syn and anti isomers of carbamates as well. Intra- and intermolecular\nhydrogen bonding may also perturb the syn\u2013anti isomer equilibrium of carbamates.22,25,30\n\nA representative example of hydrogen\nbonding and concentration\ndependence was provided by Gottlieb, Nudelman, and collaborators.28 The authors took into consideration N-Boc-amino acids and their corresponding methyl esters.\nAn unusual abundance of syn-rotamer for N-Boc-amino acids was detected. N-Boc-amino acid\nesters give the expected spectra, consistent with previous reports\nof only a single species being observed at room temperature. Concentration-dependent 1H NMR spectra indicate that the proportion of the syn-rotamers increases with concentration, supporting the\nexistence of an aggregation process.28\n\nSince decreasing temperature is another method for stabilizing\noligomerization, NMR experiments were also performed at different\ntemperatures. As expected, when the temperature increases, the favored\nrotamer switches from syn to anti. Overall, the collected data strongly supports the concept that\nthe syn rotamers of N-carbamoylated\namino acids form intermolecularly H-bonded species and the OH of the\ncarboxylic acid must be involved in this process, as the corresponding\nesters do not behave similarly. To explain this phenomenon, the formation\nof a dimer was suggested (Figure 3).\n\nSupport of this hypothesis\nwas provided by adding increasing amounts\nof acetic acid to a solution of a carbamoylated amino acid ester.\nAs expected, the syn rotamer appeared, and its concentration\nincreased as a function of the amount of acid added. In contrast,\naddition of acetic acid to a solution of the corresponding carbamoylated\namino acid did not affect the anti/syn ratio. In this context, Moraczewski and co-workers designed a more\neffective hydrogen-bonding system that selectively perturbs the syn/anti rotamer equilibrium of a target\ncarbamate group.22 The authors examined\nthe abilities of acetic acid and 2,6-bis(octylamido)pyridine (3) to perturb the syn/anti ratio of carbamates 1 and 2 (Figure 4).22\n\nIn a CDCl3 solution, acetic acid moderately stabilizes\ndouble hydrogen bonding of the syn rotamer of phenyl\ncarbamate 1 (Figure 4A), with\nno relevant effect on the syn/anti ratio for 2-pyridyl carbamate 2 (Figure 4B). In the second case, the carboxylic acid favors donation\nof a hydrogen bond to the more basic pyridyl nitrogen and forms the\ncomplex shown in Figure 4B. On the contrary,\nin the case of the donor\u2013acceptor\u2013donor triad 3, it strongly stabilizes the syn rotamer\nof 2 (Figure 4D) over the anti rotamer (Figure 4C). There is\nno effect on the syn/anti ratio\nfor 1, presumably because of a steric deterrent to the\nformation of a hydrogen-bonded complex (Figure 4E).\n\nThe carbamate moiety plays a noteworthy role in\nmedicinal chemistry,\nnot only because it is found in drugs but also for its presence in\na number of prodrugs.31 The rate and level\nof their hydrolysis is a key issue for the duration and intensity\nof their pharmacological activity. Fast hydrolysis of carbamate-bearing\ndrugs may result in weak or shortened activity. On the contrary, carbamate-based\nprodrugs must undergo extensive hydrolysis at a suitable rate for\nreleasing an active drug and obtaining the expected activity profile.\n\nVacondio et al. recently proposed an interesting study in which\nthey compiled a large number of reliable literature data on the metabolic\nhydrolysis of therapeutic carbamates.32 The authors were able to exploit the collected data to gain a qualitative\nrelationship between molecular structure and lability to metabolic\nhydrolysis. A trend was extrapolated, according to which the metabolic\nlability of carbamates decreased in the following series: aryl-OCO-NHalkyl\n\u226b alkyl-OCO-NHalkyl \u223c alkyl-OCO-N(alkyl)2 \u2265 alkyl-OCO-N(endocyclic) \u2265 aryl-OCO-N(alkyl)2 \u223c aryl-OCO-N(endocyclic) \u2265 alkyl-OCO-NHAryl\n\u223c alkyl-OCO-NHacyl \u226b alkyl-OCO-NH2 > cyclic\ncarbamates.32 Therefore, carbamates derived\nfrom ammonia or aliphatic amines are sufficiently long-lived. An example\nis represented by cefoxitin (4), a second-generation\ncephalosporin antibiotic (Figure 5). Cyclic\nfive- or six-membered carbamates are quite stable and do not usually\nundergo metabolic ring opening. The antibacterial agent linezolid\n(5) is a representative example of this class (Figure 5). For these drugs, carbamate hydrolysis is not\nnecessarily the half-life-determining metabolic reaction. On the contrary,\nfatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor 6 (URB524)33 showed significant hydrolysis in buffer at physiological\npH after 24 h (Figure 5). Other representative\ntherapeutic carbamate drugs and prodrugs will be discussed in Sections 4 and 5, respectively.\n\nOver the years, a variety of carabamates have been prepared by\nutilizing the Hofmann rearrangement of amides,34\u221236 the Curtius\nrearrangement of acyl azides,37,38 the reductive carbonylation\nof nitroaromatics,39 the carbonylation\nof amines,40 the reaction of alcohols with\nisocyanates,41 and carbon dioxide alkylation.42\u221245\n\nThe Hofmann rearrangement (Method I, Scheme 1) is well-recognized as a useful method to convert primary\ncarboxamides to amines or carbamates, characterized by the reduction\nof one carbon in the structure.46 Much\neffort has been devoted to the development of modified reagents to\noptimize the Hofmann rearrangement since the classical method for\nthis transformation, involving the use of an alkaline solution of\nbromine, is unsatisfactory and unreliable.35 A variety of oxidants and bases have been proposed as modified agents,\ne.g., iodine(III) reagents such as PhI(OAc)2,47 MeOBr,48 NBS-CH3ONa,49 NBS-KOH,46 lead tetraacetate,50 and benzyltrimethylammonium\ntribromide.51 These modified methods, however,\nrequire more than 1 equiv or an excess amount of the oxidizing reagent,\nwhich is not very convenient.\n\nThe Curtius rearrangement (Method\nII, Scheme 1) is the thermal decomposition\nof acyl azides into the isocyanate\nintermediate. This method is widely employed in the transformation\nof carboxylic acids into carbamates and ureas. Acyl azides are usually\nprepared from carboxylic acid derivatives such as acyl chlorides,52,53 mixed anhydrides,54,55 and hydrazides.56,57 Subsequent isocyanate intermediates can be trapped by a variety\nof nucleophiles to provide the carbamate derivatives. The acid chloride\nmethod is not suitable for acid-sensitive functionalities. One-pot\ntransformations of carboxylic acids into carbamates avoids the isolation\nof unstable acyl azides. However, protocols involving the use of diphenylphosphoryl\nazide (DPPA) for the one-pot Curtius reaction are also characterized\nby issues related to toxicity and the high boiling point of DPPA,\nwhich creates difficulties during workup and purification.58\u221260 Other general methods for carbamate preparation involve the use\nof the highly toxic phosgene,61 phosgene\nderivatives,62,63 or isocyanates.64\n\nSignificant efforts have been made to find an alternative\nto the\nphosgene process. A very attractive substitute for phosgene is carbon\ndioxide because it is a classic renewable resource (Method III, Scheme 1). In addition, its use is also very attractive\ndue to its environmentally benign nature (nontoxic, noncorrosive,\nand nonflammable).65 Carbon dioxide is\nwell-known to react rapidly with amines to form carbamic acid ammonium\nsalts. The majority of the approaches in this context rely on the\ncreation of the carbamate anion via the reaction of carbon dioxide\nand amines, followed by the reaction with electrophiles. Nevertheless,\nsince the nucleophilicity of the carbamate anion is lower than that\nof the amine formed in the equilibrium of the salt formation, the\nsubsequent reaction of the carbamate salts with alkyl halides does\nnot selectively provide urethanes.44,66\n\nThe\nformation of carbamates from isocyanates (Method IV, Scheme 1) is fundamentally important to polyurethane industries.\nSynthetic limitations and toxicity issues, however, are associated\nwith the use of phosgene, the most common route to obtain isocyanates.64 The readily available alkyl chloroformates are\nthe most frequently used reagents for the preparation of carbamates\n(Method V, Scheme 1). However, these reagents display major drawbacks, as a large excess\nof base and a long reaction time are required in order to gain acceptable\nreaction efficiency. Moreover, excess reagents are not suitable for\nthe synthesis of molecules bearing multiple functionalities in which\nthe chemoselectivity is critical.67\n\nA number of organic\ncarbonates have been developed as low-cost\nand benign alternatives to the phosgene-based routes for the synthesis\nof organic carbamates. In this context, several new alkoxycarbonylating\nagents (7\u201311) based on mixed carbonates\nhave been developed (Figure 6). These methods\nare often used for the synthesis of carbamates in drug design.68\u221272\n\nMixed carbonates with a p-nitrophenyl moiety are\nfrequently used for the preparation of a large range of carbamates.73\u221276 For this, p-nitrophenyl chloroformate (7, PNPCOCl), when treated with the suitable alcohol in the presence\nof base, furnishes the corresponding activated carbonates, which have\nbeen shown to be useful and effective alkoxycarbonylating reagents\nfor suitable amines (Scheme 2). Examples of\ncarbamate derivatives are shown in Table 1.\n\nSeveral alkoxycarbonylating\nreagents for amino groups having heterocyclic\ngroups, such as N-hydroxyimide, have been reported.\nMoreover, the utility and versatility of carbonates and oxalates containing\nan electron-withdrawing group, such as N-hydroxyimide\nand benzotriazole derivatives as reagents for various tranformations,\nhave been described.72,81,82\n\nTakeda et al. reported that 1-alkoxy[6-(trifluoromethyl)benzotriazolyl]carbonates\neasily derived from 1,1-bis[6-(trifluoromethyl)benzotriazolyl]carbonate\n(8, BTBC) showed high acylating reactivity toward alcohols\nas well as amino groups.83 BTBC was prepared\nfrom 6-trifluoromethyl-1-hydroxybenzotriazole and trichloromethyl\nchloroformate and purified by washing with dry ether. Moreover, it\ncan be stored for several months in a freezer. BTBC was allowed to\nreact with primary alcohols in acetonitrile at room temperature to\ngive stable activated carbonates. The carbonates were treated with\namines in the presence of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), providing\nthe corresponding carbamates (Scheme 2 and\nTable 2).83\n\nIn connection with our research work aimed at synthesizing\nbiologically\nactive polyfunctional molecules for probing enzyme active sites, we\nrequired a more general and synthetically reliable method for the\nsynthesis of various carbamate derivatives. In 1991, we described\nthe utility of di(2-pyridyl) carbonate (9, DPC)84 as an efficient, high-yielding, and convenient\nalkoxycarbonylation reagent for amines overcoming many of the limitations\nof existing methodologies.85 DPC was readily\nprepared from commercially available 2-hydroxypyridine and triphosgene\nin the presence of triethylamine and subsequently reacted with the\nsuitable primary or secondary alcohol (e.g., (+)-menthol) to provide\na mixed carbonate. Alkoxycarbonylation of primary and secondary amines\nwith the mixed carbonates was carried out in the presence of triethylamine\nand furnished the corresponding carbamates in good yields (Scheme 2, Method A, and Table 3).\nPotassium hydride was used in the place of triethylamine in the preparation\nof the mixed carbonates containing tertiary alcohols (Scheme 2 and Table 3).85\n\nSubsequently, we investigated\nthe scope of N,N\u2032-disuccinimidyl\ncarbonate (10, DSC)81 promoted\nalkoxycarbonylation of amines with\na host of alcohols under mild conditions.86 Rich and co-workers highlighted the convenience of succinimidyl-based\nmixed carbonates for the high-yielding introduction of a 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxycarbonyl\n(Teoc) protecting group to amino acids, without oligopeptide byproduct\nformation.87 DSC was found to be a highly\neffective alkoxycarbonylating reagent for a variety of primary and\nsterically hindered secondary alcohols. DSC is commercially available,\nor it can be conveniently prepared from N-hydroxysuccinimide\nfollowing a procedure tracing out the synthesis of DPC.85 The ready availability of DSC, the stability\nof the mixed carbonates, and the mildness of the reaction procedure\nrender this method a reliable route to organic carbamates (Scheme 2 and Table 4).86\n\nSince azides were\nextensively employed as incipient amines in the\ncontext of amino sugar and amino acid syntheses, their conversion\ninto the corresponding carbamate derivatives could provide a novel,\neffective route for medicinal chemistry applications. In this context,\na facile synthetic protocol to transform various azides into the corresponding\nfunctionalized urethanes in high yields has been developed.90 In general, mixed carbonates of variously protected\nalcohols were prepared by reaction of excess DSC or DPC, as described\npreviously. Exposure of mixed carbonates to catalytic hydrogenation\nconditions with azides in the presence of 10% palladium on charcoal\nin tetrahydrofuran furnished the corresponding carbamates. Interestingly,\nthe use of triethylamine as a promoter has a notable effect on the\nyield and the rate of the alkoxycarbonylation process (Scheme 2 and Table 5).90\n\nMore recently, Yoon and\nco-workers exploited 2-substituted-pyridazin-3(2H)-ones as electrophilic transfer reagents.91,92 In particular, the authors investigated the carbonylation potency\nof phenyl 4,5-dichloro-6-oxopyridazine-1(6H)-carboxylate\n(11) to amines for the preparation of phenylcarbamates\n(Scheme 2 and Table 6). Compound 11 is stable in air and in organic solvents\nat high temperature and is prepared easily from cheap and commercially\navailable 4,5-dichloropyridazin-3(2H)-one (12) in the presence of phenylchloroformate and triethylamine\n(Scheme 2).\n\nThe application of\ncarbon dioxide in organic synthesis has recently\nattracted much interest. Most of the approaches rely on the generation\nof the carbamate anion via the reaction of carbon dioxide and amines,\nfollowed by the reaction with electrophiles, usually alkyl halides.93\u221295\n\nIn this context, a mild and efficient preparation of alkyl\ncarbamates on solid supports was described by Jung et al.96 Amines and anilines were coupled with Merrifield\u2019s\nresin through a CO2 linker in the presence of cesium carbonate\nand tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI). Carbon dioxide was supplied\nby bubbling it into the reaction suspension, where N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) was the solvent of choice\n(Scheme 3).96\n\nThe reaction conditions are\nconvenient for purification, and the\nreactions undergo complete conversions. The method is convenient for\nthe generation of large combinatorial libraries for rapid screening\nof bioactive molecules. Chiral substrates susceptible to racemization\nhave survived the conditions (Table 7).\n\nLater, these authors reported a one-pot synthesis\nof N-alkyl carbamates starting from primary amines\n(Scheme 4).96 Carbamates\nwere generated\nvia a three-component coupling of primary amines, CO2,\nand an alkyl halide in the presence of cesium carbonate and TBAI in\nanhydrous DMF (Scheme 4 and Table 8).\n\nDirect N-alkylation of the intermediate\ncarbamate\nA in the presence of additional cesium carbonate by using a different\nalkyl halide gave rise to the desired N-alkyl carbamate B (Scheme 4). Isolation of the intermediate A proved to be unnecessary, offering shortened synthetic sequences.40 It is interesting to note that TBAI helps to\nminimize the overalkylation of the produced carbamate, presumably\nby enhancing the rate of CO2 incorporation and/or stabilizing\nthe incipient carbamate anion through conjugation with the tetrabutylammonium\ncation.97\n\nSakakura and co-workers\nreported urethane synthesis by the reaction\nof dense carbon dioxide with amines and alcohols by a procedure that\nis not only phosgene-free but also completely halogen-free (Scheme 5).98 Dialkyl carbonate\nsynthesis from an alcohol and CO2 is catalyzed by metal\ncomplexes such as dialkyl(oxo)tin and dialkyl(dichloro)tin. However,\nthe alcohol conversion is very poor. Similarly, the direct reaction\nof an amine, an alcohol, and carbon dioxide in the presence of dialkyltin\ncompounds produced urethane only in a poor yield.\n\nThe low conversion\nobserved was attributed by the authors to thermodynamic\nlimitations and catalyst deactivation by coproduced water. In order\nto overcome this issue, a new reaction system utilizing acetals as\na chemical dehydrating agent, with subsequent alcohol regeneration\n(Scheme 5), was developed.\n\nIn order to\nobtain urethane in good yields, dense-phase CO2 under high\npressure was necessary to lower the major side\nreactions, namely imine formation from acetone and alkylation of amines\nby alcohols.\n\nHowever, developing less toxic and more active catalysts\nbased\non metals other than tin was required. Later, these authors reported\nnovel nickel-based catalytic systems for dehydrative urethane formation\nfrom carbon dioxide, amines, and alcohols (Scheme 6).99 Interestingly, adding nitrogen-based\nbidentate ligands efficiently improved the catalytic activity of Ni(OAc)2-based catalysts (Scheme 6 and Table 9). Bipyridines and phenanthrolines with strong coordinating\nabilities (low steric hindrance and high electron densities) were\nthe better choice for obtaining urethanes in high yields. It is important\nto note that the Ni-phenanthroline system is more active and less\ntoxic than dialkyl(oxo)tin under the same reaction conditions. It\nis also noteworthy that the catalytic activity of the Ni(OAc)2-(4,4\u2032-dimethylbipyridine) system is highly dependent\non the ligand/metal ratio (Table 9).\n\nPeterson and co-workers proposed\na method for rapid SAR development\nof compounds bearing urea or carbamate functionalities (Scheme 7).100 For carbamate formation,\nan amine, in principle, could proceed through the carbamic acid\u2013isocyanate\nreaction, and subsequent reaction with an alcohol may provide a carbamate\nproduct.\n\nWhile this is precedented\nby an intramolecular reaction variant\nto produce cyclic carbamates,101 the desired\nintermolecular coupling was not fruitful under the proposed reaction\nconditions. Carbamic acids produced from secondary amines, however,\ndid react with alcohols under Mitsunobu conditions (dibenzyl azodicarboxylate,\nDBAD, and tributylphosphine) in a DBU-catalyzed reaction with gaseous\ncarbon dioxide, providing the corresponding carbamates (Scheme 7 and Table 10). This reaction\ndid not proceed through the isocyanate intermediate but rather through\nan SN2 displacement of the activated alcohol. This hypothesis\nis supported by the observed inversion of stereochemistry upon conversion\nof a chiral secondary alcohol to the corresponding carbamate (Table 10).100\n\nVery recently, Jiao and co-workers reported a practical,\nPdCl2-catalyzed efficient assembly of organic azides, carbon\nmonoxide,\nand alcohols for the direct synthesis of carbamates via isocyanate\nformation and application in situ (Scheme 8).102\n\nMild and neutral reaction conditions and generation\nof harmless\nN2 as the byproduct render this protocol very useful, particularly\nfor the synthesis of bioactive compounds. Moreover, the employment\nof CO at atmospheric pressure and the use of a small amount of PdCl2 catalyst (2 mol %) in the absence of any ligand represent\na real alternative to customary carbamate synthetic methods (Table 11).102\n\nThe synthesis of carbamates through the\ngeneration of carbamoyl\nchlorides is not convenient because of the requirement of the toxic\nphosgene. Also, such carbamoyl chlorides are highly reactive, prone\nto hydrolysis, unstable, and not suitable for long-term storage. For\nthese problems, Batey and co-workers identified the use of carbamoylimidazolium\nsalts as convenient N,N\u2032-disubstituted\ncarbamoyl transfer reagents, showing increased reactivity over carbamoylimidazoles\nas a result of the imidazolium effect (Scheme 9).103\u2212105\n\nThese salts are readily prepared\nby the sequential treatment of\nsecondary amines with N,N\u2032-carbonyldiimidazole\n(CDI) and iodomethane (Scheme 9). Authors envisaged\nthat the carbamoylimidazolium salts, while relatively unreactive with\nalcohols, would react with nucleophlic alkoxides to produce the corresponding\ncarbamates (Table 12). In the case of phenols,\ntertiary amines are appropriate bases for the in situ generation of the reactive phenoxides. The lower acidity of aliphatic\nalcohols presumably prevents the formation of the alkoxide anion,\nwhich would serve as the reactive nucleophile. Less acidic alcohols\nreact with carbamoylimidazolium after their conversion into more nucleophilic\nsodium alkoxides (Scheme 9).106\n\nThe use of solid-supported\nreagents has become ubiquitous due to\nenhanced reactivity and selectivity, milder reaction conditions, convenient\nwork-ups, and decreased solvent waste. The modified Hofmann rearrangement,\nproposed by Gogoi et al., is operationally simple, inexpensive and\napplicable to a variety of aliphatic and aromatic amides for the synthesis\nof methyl carbamates (Scheme 10).36\n\nKF/Al2O3 represents a useful and\ninteresting\nsolid-supported strong base, which replaces organic bases in a variety\nof reactions.107 Sodium hypochlorite is\nan inexpensive, convenient, and safe alternative to the currently\nemployed oxidants.108 This prompted the\nauthors to investigate KF/Al2O3 along with NaOCl\nas an efficient reagent system for Hofmann rearrangement. KF/Al2O3 basicity stems from the formation of KOH in\nthe initial preparation of the solid-supported material by the reaction\nof KF with alumina supports. Under these highly basic reaction conditions,\nhypochlorite ion is the predominant form of chlorine, reacting with\nthe amide to form an N-chloroamide, which later undergoes\nrearrangement to the isocyanate. In the presence of methanol, the\nisocyanate is rapidly converted into the corresponding methyl carbamate\n(Table 13).36\n\nModifications of the Curtius rearrangement have also\nbeen explored.\nLebel and co-workers have reported a useful protocol for the preparation\nof tert-butyl carbamates from the corresponding carboxylic\nacids.109 Their reaction with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate and sodium azide led to the formation\nof the corresponding acyl azides, which then undergo a Curtius rearrangement,\nin the presence of tetrabutylammonium bromide and zinc(II) triflate,\nproviding carbamates through trapping of the isocyanate intermediate\n(Scheme 11A and Table 14).\n\nThese authors extended the\nsame methodology to the direct synthesis\nof carbamates of aromatic amines using aromatic carboxylic acids (Scheme 11B and Table 14).110 In particular, the reaction of a chloroformate\nor di-tert-butyl dicarbonate and sodium azide with\nan aromatic carboxylic acid produced the corresponding acyl azide,\npresumably through the formation of an azidoformate. In contrast to\nwhat was observed with aliphatic carboxylic acids, using similar reaction\nconditions, aromatic carboxylic acids led mainly to the formation\nof the corresponding tert-butyl ester, likely via\nthe displacement of an azide leaving group with tert-butoxide. This may be ascribed to the higher stability of aromatic\nacyl azides with respect to their aliphatic counterparts. Therefore,\nfor these substrates, the Curtius rearrangement can be promoted only\nat higher temperatures (40 vs 75 \u00b0C).110,111\n\nAs mentioned,\nalkyl chloroformates are the most frequently used\nreagents for the preparation of carbamates, although the need of an\nexcess amount limits their usefulness. A promising method for preparing\ncarbamates involves the use of a catalytic promoter.112\u2212115 Lately, indium-mediated reactions have gained significant consideration\ndue to the high reactivity and unique properties of indium reagents,\namong them nontoxicity and inertness toward air and water.116\u2212118 Moreover, pretreatment is not required for activating indium metal.\nIn this context, Jang and co-workers developed a simple, efficient,\nand selective method for synthesizing carbamates from amines, employing\na catalytic amount of indium and only an equimolar amount of alkyl\nchloroformate (Scheme 12).67\n\nThe method shows the generality for a wide variety\nof sterically\ndiverse amines and alcohols and can also be applicable for the selective\nprotection of amino groups under mild conditions (Table 15).\n\nArndtsen et al. proposed\nanother application of indium-based reagents\nfor the generation of N-protected amines in a single step (Scheme 13 and Table 16).119\n\nSince organoindium reagents readily transfer their organic\ngroups\nto an imine carbon, only one-third of an equivalent is required, and\nthe only byproduct is represented by indium trichloride. Tetraorganoindium\nreagents can also be employed in a similar fashion for transferring\nall four organic groups. Therefore, one-fourth of an equivalent of\nindium is necessary for their reaction with imines. Copper(I) chloride\n(10%) was found to be the most efficient catalyst.\n\nSodeoka and colleagues reported the use of 1-alkoxycarbonyl-3-nitro-1,2,4-triazole\nreagents as useful intermediates for the preparation of carbamates\n(Scheme 14).121 To\nachieve a rapid and clean reaction, the features of the leaving group\nhave a key role. An ideal leaving group should have a highly electron-withdrawing\nelement in order to increase the electrophilicity of the carbonyl\ncarbon, and the nucleophilicity should be low to avoid side reactions.\nIt should also be easily separated from the reaction product. 3-Nitro-1,2,4-triazole\n(NT),120 although showing nucleophilicity,\ncould be easily removed from the reaction due to its insolubility\nin dichloromethane or chloroform.\n\nNT-based reagents\nhave a series of benefits such as high stability,\nsince they can be stored for long periods without decomposition. Reactions\nof these NT reagents with primary and secondary amines proceeded quickly\nto give the corresponding carbamates in >95% yield (Scheme 14A and Table 17). In contrast\nto aliphatic amines, aromatic amines were less reactive. However,\nthe addition of triethylamine was found to be effective in promoting\nthe reactions (Scheme 14B and Table 17).121\n\nThe reductive carbonylation of aromatic\nnitro compounds to the\ncorresponding carbamates has remained a subject of great interest\nboth from mechanistic and application standpoints (Scheme 15). In this section, we will briefly mention the\nmethodologies involving the use of an alcohol, although other procedures\nemploying chloroformates have also been recently reported.122,123\n\nCheng and collaborators\nreport the use of Ru(CO)4\u2013 and Ru3(CO)12 complexes for\nthe catalysis of this reaction and highlighted the key effect of alcohol\non the selectivity of carbamates (Table 18).124 The results clearly indicate that low selectivity\nof carbamate is closely related to the ability of the alcohol to reduce\nnitroarenes to amino derivatives. Therefore, the employment of an\nalcohol that cannot reduce nitroarene greatly increases the selectivity\nof carbamate. Later, the binuclear rhodium complex [(Ph3P)4Rh2(\u03bc-OH)2]\u00b72C6H6 was employed as an effective catalyst for the\nreductive carbonylation of nitrobenzenes to carbamate esters (Table 18).125 Palladium-based\ncatalysts have also been explored (Table 18).126\u2212128\n\nCarbamate synthesis via transfunctionalization\nof substituted ureas\nand carbonates in the presence of di-n-butyltin oxide\n(DBTO) as the catalyst was reported by Chaudhari and colleagues (Scheme 16A and Table 19).129\n\nThe carbonate reactivity pattern seems to be driven by\nthe leaving\ngroup ability of the alkoxides and phenoxide to form the carbamate\nobserved in aminolysis of carbonates. It has been shown that basicity\nof reacting urea plays a vital role in the catalytic activity of this\nreaction. Indeed, aliphatic ureas show higher reactivity compared\nto aromatic ureas due to their higher basicity. The basic DBTO is\nsupposed to work as a nucleophile by attacking the carbonyl carbon\nof the carbonate, thus generating the catalytically active species\ndibutyl alkoxy carbonato tin [a].130 As\nshown, species [a] interacts with substituted urea to eliminate one\nmolecule of carbamate, forming dibutyl alkoxy carbamato tin [b].131 A further reaction of species [b] with a carbonate\nresults in the formation of one more molecule of carbamate with regeneration\nof the active species [a] (Scheme 16B).\n\nUse of dialkyl carbonates as environmentally friendly\nand nontoxic\nphosgene substitutes in alkoxycarbonylation reactions has also been\nexploited by Porco et al. (Scheme 17).132\n\nParticularly, the\nauthors examined the scope of Zr(IV)-catalyzed\ncarbonate\u2013carbamate exchange processes to prepare carbamates\nfrom dialkyl carbonates employing 2-hydroxypyridine (HYP) as a catalytic\nadditive (Table 20).\n\nRecently, Padiya and co-workers reported\na useful method for preparing\ncarbamates in an aqueous media (Scheme 18).133\n\nInterestingly, they\nfound that 1,1\u2032-carbonyldiimidazole\n(CDI), although unstable in water, rapidly reacts in aqueous media\nwith amine to give good yields of the corresponding N-substituted carbonylimidazolide. Carbonylimidazolide derived from\nthe primary amine reacts in situ with a nucleophile\nsuch as phenol, providing the corresponding carbamate. The product\nprecipitates out from the reaction mixture and can be obtained in\nhigh purity by filtration, making the method simple and scalable (Table 21).133\n\nCDI was also found to mediate the Lossen rearrangement,\nwhich occurs\nin the transformation of an activated hydroxamic acid into the corresponding\nisocyanate (Scheme 19).134\n\nThe proposed methodology is\nexperimentally efficient and mild,\nbeing characterized by imidazole and CO2 as the only stoichiometric\nbyproducts. This method is a green and unconventional alternative\nto the Curtius and Hofmann rearrangements (Table 22).135 Another method based on the\nLossen rearrangement was recently proposed.136 The methodology envisaged the reaction of a hydroxamic acid with\nan alcohol, promoted by 2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-triazine (cyanuric chloride;\nTCT) in the presence of an excess of N-methyl morpholine\n(NMM) (Scheme 20 and Table 22).\n\nRivastigmine (194, Figure 7) tartrate (Exelon, Novartis\nPharma) is a carbamate derivative that reversibly inhibits the metabolism\nof acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) preferentially\nin the central nervous system (CNS). It is used for the treatment\nof mild-to-moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) dementia and dementia\ndue to Parkinson\u2019s disease.137,138 The drug\ncan be administered orally or via a transdermal patch. The transdermal\npatch reduces side effects such as nausea and vomiting. Rivastigmine\nundergoes extensive metabolism by ChE-mediated hydrolysis to the decarbamylated\nmetabolite, without involvement of the major cytochrome P450 (CYP450)\nisozymes. The metabolite may undergo N-demethylation\nas well as conjugation. The pharmacokinetic half-life of rivastigmine\nin AD patients is around 1.5 h. When given orally, rivastigmine is\nwell-absorbed, with a bioavailability of about 40% administered as\na 3 mg dose.137,139\n\nMuraglitazar (195) contains a carbamate functionality.\nIt is a potent, novel\nnonthiazolidindione peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor dual\nagonist (PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3) that demonstrated highly efficacious\nglucose and lipid lowering activities in vivo, along\nwith an excellent ADME profile.140 In a\ndouble-blind randomized clinical trial, muraglitazar resulted in a\nstatistically significant improvement in plasma triglyceride, HDL\ncholesterol, apoB, and non-HDL cholesterol concentrations at week\n12. Muraglitazar reduced triglyceride concentrations to a larger extent\nthan did pioglitazone, regardless of baseline triglyceride levels.\nMuraglitazar and pioglitazone treatment was associated with slight\n(3\u20134%) increases in LDL cholesterol. However, muraglitazar\ndevelopment was discontinued due to major adverse cardiovascular side\neffects.141\n\nRoxifiban (196) is a carbamate derivative with a methyl\nester prodrug. It is a\npotent, nonpeptide antagonist of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor.142,143 The free acid resulting from roxifiban hydrolysis blocks the binding\nof fibrinogen to the receptor, thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation\nand providing a mechanism for antithrombotic therapy. However, clinical\ndevelopment of roxifiban was discontinued in October 2001.\n\nEntinostat (197, MS-275) contains\na pyridylmethyl carbamate functionality.144 It is undergoing clinical trials for the treatment\nof various cancers. Entinostat preferentially inhibits HDAC1 (IC50 = 300 nM) over HDAC3 (IC50 = 8 \u03bcM) and\nis reported to have no inhibitory activity toward HDAC8 (IC50 > 100 \u03bcM). This drug induces cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor\n1A (p21/CIP1/WAF1), thereby slowing cell growth, differentiation,\nand tumor development in vivo. Recent studies suggest that 197 may be particularly\nuseful as an antineoplastic agent when combined with other drugs like\nadriamycin.144\u2212146\n\nAlbendazole\n(198, Albenza, Teva Pharmaceuticals) is a broad-spectrum\nanthelmintic carbamate drug. It undergoes rapid hepatic oxidation\nby liver microsomal enzymes, producing the active metabolite albendazole\nsulfoxide, which is then oxidized to the inactive metabolites albendazole\nsulfone and albendazole-2-amino sulfone.147\n\nMebendazole (199) is a methyl carbamate derivative\nshowing broad-spectrum anthelmintic properties. It demonstrated efficacy\nin the oral treatment of ascariasis, uncinariasis, oxyuriasis, and\ntrichuriasis. Like other benzimidazole anthelmintics, mebendazole\u2019s\nprimary mechanism of action is consistent with tubulin binding.148 Mebendazole was discontinued in 2011.149\n\nFlupirtine\n(200) and retigabine (201) are ethyl carbamate\nderivatives. Flupirtine is a centrally acting nonopioid analgesic150 that was identified within an antiepileptic\ndrug discovery program by the U.S. National Institutes of Health.\nThe doses used in a small clinical trial exceeded those established\nfor analgesic activity.151 On the basis\nof this data, subsequent structural optimization resulted in retigabine.152 Retigabine has anticonvulsant properties that\nappear to be mediated by opening or activating neuronal voltage-gated\npotassium channels. Flupirtine showed N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist properties.\n\nFelbamate (202, Felbatol, Meda\nPharmaceuticals) is an alkyl carbamate derivative.\nIt is an antiepileptic drug. The mechanism of action of felbamate\ninvolves a dual mechanism involving inhibition of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor response and positive\nmodulation of \u03b3-amino butyric acid subtype A (GABAA) receptor, thus decreasing neuronal excitation.153 Felbamate is rapidly absorbed (tmax = 2\u20136 h) with an oral bioavailability > 90%.154 Felbamate undergoes moderate metabolism via\nCYP3A4 and CYP2E1 isoenzymes, which are amenable to inhibition and\ninduction effects.155,156 The clinical use of felbamate\nhas declined in recent years due to its serious adverse side effects.\n\nEfavirenz (203, Sustiva or Stocrin, Bristol-Myers Squibb) is a cyclic carbamate\nderivative. It is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor\n(NNRTI). The drug is used as part of highly active antiretroviral\ntherapy (HAART).157,158 However, its use is associated\nwith variable treatment response and adverse effects, in most part\nbecause of the large differences in pharmacokinetics.159 CYP2B6 is the main enzyme catalyzing the major\nclearance mechanism of efavirenz (8-hydroxylation to 8-hydroxyefavirenz) in vivo.160,161\n\nZafirlukast (204, Accolate, AstraZeneca) is a cyclopentyl N-aryl carbamate derivative. It is a selective and competitive\nreceptor\nantagonist of the cysteinyl leukotrienes D-4 and E-4, which is indicated\nfor the prophylaxis and treatment of mild-to-moderate persistent and\nchronic asthma.162 Both O \u2192 CH2 and O \u2192 NH bioisosteric analogues of Zafirlukast were\nfound to be potent. The carbamate moiety present in zafirlukast provided\nan excellent in vitro and in vivo profile and high oral bioavailability.163 Zafirlukast undergoes hepatic metabolism, where hydroxylation by\ncytochrome CYP2C9 is the major biotransformation pathway. The metabolites\nof zafirlukast do not significantly contribute to its overall activity.164\n\nMitomycin C (205, MMC, Mutamycin) is a complex carbamate\nderivative. It\nis an antitumor antibiotic that was identified in the 1950s in fermentation\ncultures of the Gram-negative bacteria Streptomyces\ncaespitosus.165 MMC is\na site-specific, nondistorting DNA cross-linking agent.166,167 However, recent reports suggest that DNA may not be the primary\ntarget of the drug. In particular, interaction of MMC with rRNA and\nsubsequent inhibition of protein translation has been proposed.168 MMC is customarily used as a chemotherapeutic\nagent in the treatment of several types of cancer, such as bladder,\ncolon, and breast cancers.169\n\nRitonavir (206, Norvir, ABT-538, A-84538, AbbVie,\nInc.) structure possesses a thiazolyl\nmethyl carbamate functionality. It is a peptidomimetic inhibitor of\nboth the HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases and was approved by the FDA in\nMarch 1996.175 This first-generation protease\ninhibitor was developed at Abbott Laboratories. The discovery of ritonavir\nwas based on studies with C2-symmetric diamine subunits.\nRitonavir showed EC50 of 0.025 \u03bcM, bioavailability\nof 78%, and a plasma half-life of 1.2 h. Ritonavir has a high molecular\nweight; however, it showed excellent pharmacokinetic properties. This\nis possibly due to the increased stability of the thiazole groups\nto oxidative metabolism and also due to its effect on cytochrome P450\noxidative enzymes. Ritonavir is a type II heme ligand that fits into\nthe CYP3A4 active site cavity and irreversibly binds to the heme iron\nvia the thiazole nitrogen.176 Inhibiting\nCYP3A4, ritonavir increases plasma concentrations of other anti-HIV\ndrugs oxidized by CYP3A4, thereby improving their clinical efficacy.\n\nAmprenavir (46, Agenerase, VX-478, GlaxoSmithKline, Vertex) is a tetrahydrofuranyl\ncarbamate derivative. It was approved by the FDA in April 1999. Amprenavir\nwas identified as a potent, orally bioavailable HIV-1 protease inhibitor\nwith a low molecular weight and a mean IC50 of 12 nM.177 It is marketed with a twice-a-day dosing format.\nAmprenavir structure bears a stereochemically defined tetrahydrofuranylcarbamate\nengaging in a weak backbone interaction with the protease.178,179In vitro and in vivo studies have\nshown that amprenavir is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, and the\ntwo major metabolites result from oxidation of the tetrahydrofuran\nand aniline moieties.180\n\nAtazanavir (207, ATV, Reyataz\n(ATV sulfate), BMS-232632, Bristol-Myers Squibb) is\na methyl carbamate derivative. It is a hydroxyethylene hydrazide-based\nsecond-generation HIV-protease inhibitor developed in the late 1990s\nand approved by the FDA in June 2003.181 ATV contains two methylcarbamate functionalities. It showed potent\nenzyme inhibitory activity (Ki = 2.66\nnM), and its antiviral IC50 in HIVMN-infected\nMT-2 cells was 26 nM.182,183 ATV displayed excellent bioavailability.\nThe favorable pharmacological profile for ATV raised the possibility\nof once-daily dosing.182,184\n\nDarunavir (48, DRV TMC-114) possesses a structure-based\ndesigned bis-tetrahydrofuranyl\n(bis-THF) carbamate functionality. It is a new generation HIV-1 protease\ninhibitor with improved bioavailability, potency, and drug properties.\nDRV also maintains high potency against multidrug-resistant HIV-1\nstrains. The design of DRV originated from the backbone binding concept\nenvisaging that an effective protease inhibitor maximizes rich networks\nof hydrogen-bonding interactions with the backbone atoms throughout\nthe active site of the protease.185 The\nbis-THF moiety present in DRV was designed based on the X-ray structure\nof inhibitor-HIV-1 protease complexes. The bis-THF carbamate moiety\nof DRV was found to be essential for enzyme affinity (see Figure 14 for details). DRV demonstrated exceptional potency\nagainst both wild-type HIV isolates and a wide range of resistant\nvariants.186,187 DRV received FDA approval in\n2006 for the treatment of HIV/AIDS patients harboring multidrug-resistant\nHIV-1 variants. In 2008, DRV received full approval for the treatment\nof therapy-naive adults and children.188 DRV is metabolized by the isoenzyme CYP3A4.189,190 However, in the presence of a low dose of ritonavir, DRV exhibits\nvery good pharmacokinetic properties in patients.191\n\nMost of the therapeutically relevant carbamate prodrugs\nhave been\ndesigned as substrates of specific enzymes. Antibody-directed enzyme\nprodrug therapy (ADEPT)197,198 and gene-directed\nenzyme prodrug therapy (GDEPT)199 are new\nstrategies for targeting tumors. Carboxypeptidase G2 (CPG2), an enzyme\nof bacterial origin, has been shown to catalyze the cleavage of an\namide, carbamate, or urea linkage between glutamic acid and an aromatic\ngroup. On the basis of this specificity, a large number of prodrugs\nhave been designed and synthesized for CPG2. As shown in Figure 9, the prodrug 208 (ZD2767P)200 is activated by hydrolysis at the carbamate\nbond by CPG2 to the corresponding potent di-iodophenol mustard (209).201208 was found\nto possess the best profile in terms of enzymatic kinetics, cytotoxicity,\nand in vivo efficacy. It was selected for clinical\ndevelopment. The half-life (t1/2) of the\ndrug is approximately 2 min, which is enough for diffusion into the\ntumor cell from the local release site and to minimize peripheral\ntoxicity.192,202\n\nIrinotecan was designed\nto deliver camptothecin as a predominant topoisomerase I inhibitor\nfor anticancer therapy. Irinotecan hydrochloride salt 210 (CPT-11, Camptosar; Pfizer) is a parenteral aqueous soluble carbamate\nprodrug of antineoplastic topoisomerase I inhibitor 211 (SN-38, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin). The potent antitumor activity\nof irinotecan is due to rapid formation of active metabolite 211in vivo (Figure 9). In this molecule, a dipiperidino ionizable promoiety is linked\nto the phenol functionality by a carbamate bond, thus improving the\noverall aqueous solubility.203\u2212205 The bioconversion back to 211 occurs primarily by human liver microsomal carboxylesterases,\nCES 1A1 and CES2, which release the ionizable piperidinopiperidine\npromoiety and 211, the active form of the drug.205\n\nBeyond minimizing the rate of enzymatic\nhydrolysis of its prodrug,\nsustained drug action can also be provided by decreasing the rate\nof drug metabolism. This is the case of bambuterol (212, Bambec, AstraZeneca), a bis-dimethyl carbamate prodrug of the \u03b22-agonist\nterbutaline (213), which is used as a bronchodilator\nin the treatment of asthma. The phenolic moiety of terbutaline is\nsubjected to rapid presystemic metabolism. In bambuterol, protection\nof this functionality also avoids first-pass intestinal and hepatic\nmetabolism. This prodrug is inactive, however, after oral administration;\nit is slowly converted to terbutaline, mainly outside the lungs, by\na series of hydrolysis and oxidation reactions (maily catalyzed by\nplasma cholinesterase, pChE, and by CYP450, Figure 9).206,207 This allows a once-daily bambuterol\ntreatment with respect to the three daily terbutaline administrations.208\n\nAn N,N\u2032-dimethyl ethylenediamine\nspacer, used for the evaluation of cyclization-elimination-based prodrugs\nof phenols209 and alcohols,210 has been used for the development of prodrugs\nas a part of the ADEPT activation strategy. When activated by a specific\nenzyme, the terminal amino group on the spacer activates and initiates\nan intramolecular cyclization reaction to eliminate a phenol211 or alcohol212 parent\ndrug with parallel release of the cyclized spacer. In one such application,\nScherren et al.213 explored paclitaxel-2\u2032-carbamates.\nThis is particularly interesting because a free 2\u2032-hydroxyl\ngroup is important for biological activity. In general, carbamate\nlinkages are more stable in vivo than esters and\ncarbonates. Since the proteolytic active form of plasmin is located\nin the tumor, linking a cytotoxic drug to a plasmin substrate may\nresult in tumor-selective delivery. On the basis of this rationale,\nfollowing plasmin hydrolysis, the spacer is expected to undergo spontaneous\ncyclization to yield a cyclic urea derivative (imidazolidinone), thereby\nreleasing paclitaxel (214), as illustrated in Scheme 21.192,214\n\nThe amine group is one of the most common functional groups in many\napproved drugs. Amines in drugs can cause physicochemical hurdles\nthat have the potential to limit their safety and effective delivery\nto desired sites of action. Therefore, a variety of prodrugs of amines\nhave been designed to overcome formulation and delivery barriers.\nThe carbamate functionality has been utilized in many prodrug strategies\ndesigned for amines. Short-lived carbamates are also used as prodrugs\nof heteroaromatic amines and amidines.192\n\nGabapentin (216, Neurontin; Pfizer, Figure 10) is a structural analogue of \u03b3-aminobutyric\nacid (GABA). It is marketed as an anticonvulsant and an analgesic\nagent. Gabapentin shows a number of limitations, including saturable\nabsorption, high interpatient variability, lack of dose proportionality,\nand a short half-life. Gabapentin enacarbil (215, Horizant,\npreviously known as XP13512) is a carbamate prodrug of gabapentin.\nThe prodrug is benefited by a monocarboxylate transporter type 1 (MCT1).\nMCT1 is expressed in all segments of the colon and upper gastrointestinal\ntract. The prodrug also helps the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter\n(SMV T), responsible for absorption of multiple essential nutrients.215,216 Following absorption via these pathways, the prodrug is rapidly\nconverted to gabapentin by nonspecific esterases, mainly in enterocytes\nand to a lesser extent in the liver. During conversion to gabapentin,\neach molecule of 215 also generates carbon dioxide, acetaldehyde,\nand isobutyrate (Figure 10).217 The oral bioavailability of 215 was improved\nfrom 25 to 84% in monkeys. It showed dose-proportional gabapentin\nexposure in humans.193 In 2011, Xenoport\nreceived FDA approval (Horizant) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe\nrestless legs syndrome. In 2012, Horizant was also approved for the\nmanagement of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) in adults.218\n\nCapecitabine (217, Xeloda,\nRoche) was designed to\nachieve greater selectivity than its active form, 5-fluorouracil (220, 5-FU).219 It is an orally\nadministered carbamate prodrug of 5-FU, belonging to the fluoropyrimidine\ncarbamate class. It requires a cascade of three enzymes for the bioconversion\nto the active drug.220 As shown in Figure 10, the enzymatic bioconversion starts in the liver,\nwhere human carboxylesterases 1 and 2 (CES1 and CES2) cleave the carbamate\nester bond.219 Intact capecitabine is absorbed\nin the intestine, and its bioconversion in the liver releases the\nparent drug. To some extent, its bioconversion proceeds in tumors,\nthus avoiding any systemic toxicity. In particular, the remaining\ntransformations to 5-FU are catalyzed by cytidine deaminase and thymidine\nphosphorylase. The latter enzyme is highly enriched in tumors, thus\nproviding selective release of 5-FU in cancer cells.220,221 The absorption of capecitabine is evident since 95% of an orally\nadministered dose is recovered in urine and the Tmax of 5-FU is reached in approximately 1.5\u20132 h.193 Capecitabine is currently approved as a first\nline of therapy for colorectal and breast cancers and is also approved\nfor use in combination with other anticancer drugs.192,222\n\nAlkoxycarbonyl derivatives can serve as useful prodrugs for\nbenzamidines.\nFor example, the methoxycarbonyl methyl ester lefradafiban (221, BIBU104, Boehringer Ingelheim, Germany) is effectively\nconverted to the active platelet aggregation inhibitor fradafiban\n(222, BIBU 52) after oral administration. This was revealed\nby monitoring the plasma concentrations of 222 and by ex vivo platelet aggregation studies. Lefradafiban is the\norally active prodrug of fradafiban, a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor\nantagonist.192 Esterases, but not CYP450-dependent\nenzymes, are involved in the conversion of lefradafiban to fradafiban in vivo (Figure 10).223\n\nOver the years, we have developed a series of\nnovel HIV-1 protease\ninhibitors incorporating cyclic ether-derived carbamates designed\nbased on the X-ray structures of inhibitor-HIV-1 protease complexes.224,225 In this endeavor, we have specifically developed stereochemically\ndefined cyclic ether templates, where the cyclic ether oxygen could\neffectively replace a peptide carbonyl oxygen. The advantage of such\nreplacement is to reduce peptidic features and improve metabolic stability\nof compounds. These cyclic ligands have been incorporated as carbamate\nderivatives. The evolution of the carbamate structural template is\nshown in Figure 11. On the basis of the X-ray\ncrystal structure of saquinavir (223)-bound HIV-1 protease,\nwe first investigated 3-(R)-tetrahydrofuranylglycine\nso that the 3-(R)-THF ring oxygen would interact\nwith the Asp30 NH, similar to the asparagine side chain carbonyl oxygen\nof saquinavir (compound 224).226\u2212228 In an effort to reduce molecular weight, the P3 quinoline was removed,\nand the amide bond was replaced with a carbamate to provide inhibitor 225 with significant reduction of molecular weight (515 Da\nfrom 670 Da). The X-ray crystal structure of 225-bound\nHIV-1 protease revealed that the ring oxygen of the 3-(S)-tetrahydrofuran (3-(S)-THF) is within proximity\nto form a hydrogen bond with the Asp29 NH bond in the S2 subsite.\nThe importance of the carbamate moiety is evident. The carbamate NH\nforms a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl of Gly27, and the\ncarbamate carbonyl functionality makes a tightly bound water-mediated\nhydrogen bond with the backbone NH\u2019s of the flap Ile50 and\nIle50\u2032 in the active site.\n\nOur further investigation\nof the 3-(S)-THF in\ninhibitors containing a hydroxyethylene isostere led to a series of\nexceptionally potent inhibitors.178 As\nshown in Table 23, 3-(S)-THF-containing\ncarbamate drivatives (compounds 226\u2013231) provided very potent inhibitors in antiviral assays. The potency\nenhancing effect of 3-(S)-THF carbamate was subsequently\ndemonstrated in inhibitors containing the (R)-(hydroxyethyl)sulfonamide\nisostere.229 Clinical development of inhibitor 46 (VX476) led to FDA approval of amprenavir for the treatment\nof HIV/AIDS patients.179,230\n\nFurther development\nof carbamate-derived novel HIV-1 protease inhibitors\nis shown in Figure 12. We have designed a variety\nof inhibitors incorporating cyclic sulfones and bicyclic ligands (Figure 12, compounds 232\u2013237).230,231 These ligands were conceived in order to\nmaximize hydrogen-bonding interactions with the protease backbone\nas well as to fill in the hydrophobic pocket in the S2 subsite. On\nthe basis of the X-ray structure of saquinavir-bound HIV-1 protease,\nwe then designed a fused bicyclic tetrahydrofuran (bis-THF) ligand\nto form hydrogen bonds with backbone aspartates in the S2 subsite\nas well as to fill in the hydrophobic site adjacent to the P3-quinoline\nring of saquinavir (Figure 12).185,232 An X-ray structural analysis of 236-bound HIV-1 protease\nrevealed that the bis-THF carbamate mimics the majority of P2\u2013P3-amide\nbonds of saquinavir. A detailed structure\u2013activity study also\nestablished that the stereochemistry of the bis-THF ring, and the\nposition of the ring oxygens is critical to potency.\n\nWith the development of a bis-THF carbamate that could form\na network\nof hydrogen bonds in the S2 subsite of HIV-1 protease, we investigated\ntransition state isosteres that can be functionalized to form hydrogen\nbonds in the S2\u2032 subsite. Our basic hypothesis was to design\ninhibitors that form a network of hydrogen bonds with the protease\nbackbone atoms throughout the active site of HIV-1 protease, from\nS2 to S2\u2032 subsites. This backbone binding strategy to combat\ndrug resistance led to the development of a series of very potent\ncarbamate-derived protease inhibitors.185,225,226 As shown in Figure 13, we\nincorporated the bis-THF ligand in the (R)-hydroxyethylsulfonamide\nisostere bearing p-methoxysulfonamide as the P2\u2032\nligand so that the methoxy oxygen can interact with aspartate backbone\natoms in the S2\u2032 subsite. The resulting inhibitors exhibited\nnotable potency.233,234 Inhibitor 239 with\na (3R,3aS,6aR)-bis-THF\nas the P2 ligand is significantly more potent in an antiviral assay\nthan corresponding inhibitor 238 with an enantiomeric\nbis-THF ligand. An X-ray structure of 239-bound HIV-1\nprotease revealed that the carbamate NH formed a hydrogen bond with\nthe backbone Gly27 carbonyl group and that carbamate carbonyl of 239 is involved in an interesting tetra-coordinated hydrogen-bonding\ninteraction with the structural water molecule, inhibitor sulfonamide\noxygen, and the flap Ile 50 NH residues. Also, the structure revealed\ninteractions with the backbone atoms in both the S2 and S2\u2032\nsubsites.235,236\n\nFurther replacement of the p-methoxy group\nat\nthe S2\u2032 to a p-amino group led to inhibitor 48 (Figure 14). This inhibitor showed\nmarked enzyme inhibitory activity as well as antiviral activity. An\nin-depth antiviral study revealed that 48 maintained\nexcellent antiviral activity against multidrug-resistant HIV-1 variants.237\u2212239 The X-ray structural studies of darunavir-bound HIV-1 protease showed\nextensive active site interactions (Figure 14). Particularly, it\nformed a network of hydrogen bonds with the protein backbone throughout\nthe active site. Darunavir also exhibited favorable pharmacokinetic\nproperties. Subsequently, clinical development led to its FDA approval\nas darunavir for the treatment of HIV/AIDS patients.240,241\n\nThe carbamate functionality of darunavir (48) was\nassembled as shown in Scheme 22. (3R,3aS,6aR)-3-Hydroxyhexahydrofuro[2,3-b]furan (bis-THF) 47 was treated with disuccinimidyl\ncarbonate to provide activated mixed carbonate 240. Reaction\nof this activated carbonate with hydroxyethylsulfonamide isostere 45 provided darunavir.242,243\n\nThe backbone binding inhibitor design strategies to combat\ndrug\nresistance have been further utilized by us and others to advance\na number of other preclinical and clinical inhibitors with carbamates.185,225 Figure 15 shows selected bis-THF-derived\ncarbamates (241\u2013244) with marked\nenzyme and antiviral activities.244\u2212247 Like darunavir, inhibitor-bound\nX-ray structures of these inhibitors showed a network of hydrogen\nbonds in both S2 and S2\u2032 subsites of HIV-1 protease. The inhibitor\nside chains as well as the bis-THF bicyclic framework also effectively\nfilled the hydrophobic pockets in the active site.\n\nWe have outlined a selected\nnumber of cyclic ether-derived carbamates\nthat have been developed based on the backbone binding concept in\nFigure 16.185,225 Particularly,\nincorporation of these stereochemically defined oxacyclic ligands\nsuch as Cp-THF, Tp-THF, Tris-THF, and fluoro-bis-THF provided exceptionally\npotent inhibitors (51 and 245\u2013249) with clinical potential.247\u2212252 The importance of the carbamate functionality in these inhibitors\nis particularly worthy of note. X-ray crystal structures of these\ninhibitors in complex with HIV-1 protease provided the ligand-binding\nsite interactions responsible for their respective antiviral potency\nagainst wild-type and multidrug-resistant viruses. In general, inhibitors\nare involved in hydrogen-bonding interactions with Asp29, Asp30, Gly27,\nAsp25, Asp25\u2032, and Asp30\u2032 in the HIV-1 protease active\nsite. Furthermore, the ring cycles adequately fill the hydrophobic\npockets in the active site.251\n\nFollowing\nthe discovery of \u03b2-secretase, the first-generation\n\u03b2-secretase inhibitors were designed and synthesized by Ghosh,\nTang, and co-workers.255 As shown in Figure 17, utilizing a carbamate derivative of the Leu\u2013Ala\nisostere 250, potent pseudopeptide inhibitors 251 and 252 were identified. The X-ray crystal structure\nof 252-bound \u03b2-secretase was determined to provide\nmolecular insight into the ligand binding site interactions.256 The in-depth structural analysis thus provided\ncritical drug design templates and led to the beginning of structure-based\ndesign approaches to peptidomimetic/nonpeptide \u03b2-secretase inhibitors.254,255\n\nThe X-ray structure of 252-bound \u03b2-secretase\nrevealed that the P2 asparagine side chain carboxamide nitrogen formed\nan intermolecular hydrogen bond with the P4 glutamic acid carbonyl\ngroup.\n\nOn the basis of this molecular insight, a number of 14\u201316-membered\ncycloamide-carbamate-based macrocyclic inhibitors were designed and\nsynthesized.257 As shown in Figure 18, acyclic carbamate derivatives (253 and 254) were less potent than their corresponding\ncyclic inhibitors. Inhibitor 255, with a 16-membered\nmacrocycle containing a trans-olefin, amide and carbamate\nfunctionalities within the macrocycle, showed good \u03b2-secretase\ninhibitory activity. Saturated inhibitor 256 is less\npotent against BACE1, but it showed enhanced potency for BACE2. X-ray\nstructural studies of inhibitor 256-bound secretase revealed\nthat the carbamate carbonyl forms a hydrogen bond with the Gln73 side\nchain carboxamide residue. Interestingly, unsaturated inhibitor 255 showed slight selectivity against memapsin 1 (Ki = 31 nM). The design of a selective inhibitor\nis important for reducing toxicity through off-target effects. Particularly,\nselectivity over other aspartic proteases, such as BACE2, pepsin,\nrenin, cathepsin D (Cat-D), and cathepsin E, may be important for\nthe reduction of side effects and drug efficiency.258\n\nOn the basis of our detailed structure\u2013activity\nstudies\nand X-ray structural analysis, we have designed a variety of highly\nselective and potent BACE1 inhibitors. In this Perspective, we will\nhighlight only the development of BACE1 inhibitors bearing carbamate\nfunctionalities. As shown in Figure 19, inhibitor 257 is a potent BACE1 inhibitor. However, it did not show\nselectivity against BACE2 or Cat-D. Subsequent structure-based design\nled to the development of selective inhibitors 258 and 259, which contain a pyrazolylmethyl and oxazolymethyl carbamate\nat the P3 position, respectively.259 Inhibitor 258 showed excellent BACE1 potency and selectivity over BACE2\nand cathepsin D. The X-ray crystal structure of 258-bound\n\u03b2-secretase revealed that the carbamate carbonyl formed a hydrogen\nbond with the Thr-232 backbone NH. Also, the pyrazole nitrogen formed\na strong hydrogen bond with the Thr-232 side chain hydroxyl group.\nThe P2-sulfonyl functionality formed a number of hydrogen bonds in\nthe S2 subsite as well. On the basis of this molecular insight, oxazole-derived 259 was designed to provide a more stable and selective inhibitor.\n\nThe synthesis of inhibitors 258 and 259 is outlined in Scheme 23. Urethanes 263 and 264 were prepared by treatment of 2,5-dimethylpyrazolylmethanol\n(260) or 2,5-dimethyl-4-oxazolemethanol (261) with triphosgene in the presence of triethylamine, followed by l-methionine methyl ester hydrochloride (262).\n\nSaponification of the resulting\nmethyl esters provided the corresponding\nacids. Coupling of amine 265 with acids 263 and 264, as described previously, and subsequent oxidation\nof the sulfides with m-chloroperbenzoic acid furnished\ninhibitors 258 and 259.259\n\nFreskos and co-workers have reported a series of\n\u03b2-secretase\ninhibitors that incorporated polar carbamate derivatives as the P2\nligand.260,261 This strategy led to improve the Cat-D selectivity.\nIt was hypothesized that the S2 subsite of Cat-D is more lipophilic\nand less tolerant of polar groups. As can be seen in Figure 20, benzyl carbamate derivative 266 displayed\n6-fold selectivity over Cat-D. However, polar 3-pyridylmethyl derivative 267 improved selectivity nearly 90-fold. The corresponding\n4-pyridyl methyl compound 268 provided a reduction in\nselectivity (\u223c50-fold). 3-(S)-Tetrahydrofuranyl carbamate 269 showed a nearly 30-fold\nselectivity over Cat-D. These inhibitors have also shown good to excellent\nIC50 values in HEK cells.\n\nOver the years, many structural\nclasses of potent and selective\n\u03b3-secretase inhibitors have been reported. A number of inhibitors\ndisplayed drug-like properties and also inhibited A\u03b2 production\nin animal models. In this section, we will review inhibitors with\ncarbamate functionality. On the basis of \u03b3-secretase inhibitor 270 (LY-411575), Peters and co-workers designed a series of\ncarbamate derivatives of dibenzazepinone as potent and metabolically\nstable \u03b3-secretase inhibitors.265 As shown in Figure 21, carbamate derivative 271 was prepared based on 270.262\u2212265 Subsequently, carbamate 272 emerged as a potent \u03b3-secretase\ninhibitor.\n\nResearchers at Pharmacopeia and\nSchering-Plough Research Institute\ndeveloped a series of potent \u03b3-secretase inhibitors containing\ntetrahydroquinoline sulfonamide and piperidine sulfonamide carbamates.266\u2212268 As shown in Figure 22, a number of representative\ncarbamate derivatives showed IC50 values in the low nanomolar\nrange. Racemic carbamate 273 first showed a good IC50 value. Enantiomers were then separated by HPLC. One of the\nenantiomers showed an IC50 value of 39 nM, whereas the\nother enantiomer displayed an IC50 > 1000 nM. Absolute\nstereochemistry of the active enantiomer was not determined. Piperidine\ncarbamate 274 also showed good potency. Carbamate derivative 275 displayed a good membrane A\u03b2 IC50 value;\nhowever, it showed poor CYP properties. Further modification led to\ncompound 276 with good inhibitory activity and improved\nCYP properties.\n\nBergstrom and co-workers reported a series of carbamate-appended N-alkyl sulfonamides as \u03b3-secretase inhibitors.269,270 Figure 23 depicts selected examples that\nshow potent A\u03b2 inhibitory activity. Sulfonamide derivative 277 was identified as a potent \u03b3-secretase inhibitor.\nExploration of carbamate-appended N-alkylsulfonamides\nresulted in potent inhibitors such as 278\u2013280. Tertiary carbamate 280 showed significant\nreduction of brain A\u03b2 in transgenic mice compared to that of\nits benzyl derivative. This compound also showed improved brain-to-plasma\nratio and good absolute brain concentration.\n\nSerine\nproteases are a large family of proteolytic enzymes that\nplay a variety of critical roles in many physiological processes.271,272 Deregulation of serine proteases has been related to the pathogenesis\nof diseases such as stroke, inflammation, Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\ncancer, and arthritis. Therefore, significant research efforts have\nbeen focused in the discovery of serine protease inhibitors. The active\nsite of all serine proteases consists of a catalytic triad of Ser,\nHis, and Asp. The nucleophilic attack by the hydroxyl group of serine\nat the carbonyl carbon of the scissile bond of the substrate, via\ngeneral base catalysis by histidine, leads to the tetrahedral transition\nstate. The tetrahedral intermediate ultimately collapses, leading\nto cleavage products.273\u2212275 These key active residues are conserved\nin all serine proteases. X-ray structural studies revealed that these\nresidues are superimposable in the majority of serine proteases.273,276 Therefore, selectivity over other serine proteases represents a\nkey issue to be taken into consideration during inhibitor design.\nMost early inhibitors acted via a covalent mechanism in which an electrophilic\ngroup formed a covalent bond with the serine hydroxyl of the catalytic\ntriad. The electrophilic groups are commonly referred to as serine\ntraps or warheads. However, covalent inhibitors lack selectivity and\nspecificity against other proteases in the same class or clan. The\nrational design of covalent serine protease inhibitors usually involves\nthe selection of a good substrate to be linked to a serine trap/warhead.\nChloromethyl ketones, diphenyl phosphonate esters, trifluoromethyl\nketones, peptidyl boronic acids, \u03b1-ketoheterocycles, and \u03b2-lactam\nderivatives are usually employed as warheads. On the basis of these\nwarheads, a variety of irreversible and reversible covalent serine\nprotease inhibitors were designed.275 In\nthis section, representative serine protease inhibitors containing\na carbamate functionality will be outlined.\n\nCarbamate derivative 281 (Figure 24), a diphenyl phosphonate\nester containing a Cbz group and bearing a single amino acid side\nchain, showed very good inhibitory activity against human plasma kallikrein,\nuseful for the treatment of hereditary angioedema.277,278 Thrombin is an attractive therapeutic target for drug development\nagainst pulmonary embolism, thrombosis, and related diseases.279,280 Compound 282 showed good potency and selectivity against\nhuman thrombin. It is stable and displayed no activity against acetylcholinesterase\nand no selectivity over cysteine proteases. Peptidyl boronic acid-based\nthrombin inhibitors were developed by DuPont-Merck. In particular, N-Boc derived inhibitor 283 is a potent inhibitor\n(Ki = 0.004 nM).281,282 Imperiali and co-workers introduced trifluoromethyl ketones as specific\nserine protease inhibitors, particularly for chymotrypsin and elastase.283 Researchers at AstraZeneca designed numerous\npeptidyl trifluoromethyl ketone derivatives as potent human elastase\ninhibitors.284\u2212286 Further optimization of features resulted\nin the development of a number of orally active inhibitors. In particular,\nmethyl carbamate derivative inhibitor 284 was shown to\nbe a very potent inhibitor (Ki = 13 nM)\nwith excellent oral bioavailability in laboratory animals.286,287 Optically pure compound 284 with an (S)-configuration at the P1 isopropyl side chain became a candidate\nfor clinical development for potential treatment of elastase-implicated\nrespiratory diseases.\n\nPeptidomimetic boronic acid-based hepatitis C virus (HCV)\nNS3/4A\nprotease inhibitors were designed and synthesized for the treatment\nof chronic HCV infections. HCV infections can lead to progressive\nliver damage, cirrhosis, and liver cancer.288 The NS3/4A serine protease plays a critical role in virus replication\nand has become an antiviral drug development target.289,290 The first specific and potent HCV protease inhibitor with good oral\nbioavailability was ciluprevir, which contains a carbamate functionality\n(285, BILN 2061, Figure 25). This\nnoncovalent macrocyclic peptidic inhibitor was the result of a substrate-based\napproach for the design of active site inhibitors. This inhibitor\nis very active in enzymatic (IC50 = 3 nM) and cell-based\nreplicon assays (IC50 = 1.2 nM) of HCV genotype 1.291 Ciluprevir was later discontinued due to cardiac\ntoxicity in animal models, but its development paved the way to boceprevir\n(Victrelis, Schering-Plough, approved by FDA in May 2011) and telaprevir\n(VX-950, Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Johnson & Johnson).292,293 In particular, for the development of boceprevir, the introduction\nof a ketoamide moiety, together with P2 and P3 optimization, led to\ninhibitor 286 showing a Ki of 66 nM.294 Its X-ray crystal structure\nin complex with the enzyme also provided insight for further optimization.\nIndeed, a cyclopropylalanine residue was found to be optimal at P1,\nand the resulting carbamate derivative 287 showed a Ki of 15 nM. Although inhibitors 286 and 287 displayed good enzyme inhibitory potency, they\ndid not display cellular activity in a subgenomic HCV replicon assay,\npossibly because of their strong peptidic character.295 The discovery that an N-methylated leucine\nat P2 was critical for both enzymatic potency and cellular activity\nled to the potential of cyclopropyl-fused proline being envisaged\nas an optimum, conformationally constrained surrogate for this part\nof the inhibitor. Combination of the P2-optimized ligand with previously\noptimized P1 and P3 residues provided carbamate derivative 288 with a Ki = 3.8 nM and IC90 = 100 nM.296 Finally, truncation and\nP1 optimization, by the employment of a cyclobutyl moiety, led to\ncompound 289 (Ki = 76 nM),\nthe direct boceprevir ancestor.297\n\nSubsequently, compounds 290 and 291 (Figure 26) with a carbamate containing\nP2 proline core showed\nvery potent inhibitory activity (IC50 = 2 nM for 290 and 23 nM for 291).298 Similarly, macrocyclic inhibitor 292 with an \u03b1-amino\ncyclic boronate showed good potency (IC50 = 43 nM).299\n\nThe electron-withdrawing effect of the ester and amide functionalities\nwas also utilized in the design of \u03b1-ketoester- or \u03b1-ketoamide-derived\ntransition state inhibitors.300 A range\nof HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors were designed and synthesized, incorporating\n\u03b1-ketoamide templates at the scissile site. Structure-based\ndesign led to a variety of potent acyclic and cyclic inhibitors with\nketoamide templates, as exemplified in compounds 293 (IC50 = 3.8 nM) and 294 (IC50 = 30 nM)\n(Figure 27).297,301\u2212303 Edwards et al. developed peptidyl \u03b1-ketoheterocycles as a\nnew template for inactivation of elastase. Tripeptidyl \u03b1-ketobenzoxazole 295 inhibited human neutrophil elastase (HNE) with an IC50 of 3 nM. The ketooxazoline-derived inhibitor 296 displayed very potent activity against HNE (IC50 = 0.6\nnM).304\n\nCarbamate derivatives\nalso play a key role as inhibitors of HCV NS5A, which represents a\nnew and promising target for HCV therapy. HCV NS5A is a zinc-binding\nphosphoprotein, and its role in the HCV virus life cycle is still\nnot clear.305 However, it plays a critical\nrole in HCV RNA replication. Also, it is involved in virion morphogenesis.306 Due to the lack of enzymatic function, inhibitors\nof this viral-encoded protein have been pursued.307 Researchers at Bristol-Myers Squibb screened a library\nof compounds for their ability to inhibit HCV RNA replication. This\nled to the identification of a lead compound specifically interfering\nwith RNA replication and later proving to inhibit the activity of\nNS5A protein. Subsequent optimization was focused on broadening the\ngenotype specificity and improving pharmacokinetic properties of compounds.\nSymmetry of the molecule played an important role in inhibitory potency.\nThis finally led to the discovery of daclatasvir (297, BMS-790052, Figure 28) a first-in-class\ninhibitor of the HCV NS5A replication complex.308 Daclatasvir was approved in Europe in August, 2014. Ledipasvir\n(298, GS-5885, Gilead Sciences, Figure 28) is another carbamate-containing HCV NS5A inhibitor with\npotent antiviral activity against HCV genotypes 1a and 1b.309 Harvoni, a combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir\n(a nucleotide polymerase inhibitor), was approved by the FDA in October\n2014 for the treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1 infection. This also\nrepresents the first approved regimen that does not require administration\nwith interferon or ribavirin.310,311\n\nCysteine proteases, also known as thiol proteases, are proteolytic\nenzymes responsible for the degradation of proteins.312 These enzymes are divided into three classes based on their\nsequence homology: the papain, caspase, and picornaviridae families.\nThe papain family of proteases is the most known and studied.313\u2212315\n\nCysteine proteases have been identified in a variety of diverse\norganisms, such as bacteria, eukaryotic micro-organisms, plants, and\nanimals and are divided into the clans CA, CD, CE, CF, and CH in the\nMEROPS peptidase database.\n\nThe largest subfamily among the class\nof cysteine proteases is\nthe papain-like cysteine proteases, originating from papain as the\narchetype of the cysteine proteases. Clan CA proteases utilize catalytic\nCys, His, and Asn residues that are invariably in this order in the\nprimary sequence of the protease. Clan CA, Family C1 (papain-family)\ncysteine proteases are well-characterized for many eukaryotic organisms.\nAlso, the best characterized Plasmodium cysteine proteases, namely,\nthe falcipains, belong to papain-family (clan CA) enzymes.\n\nClan\nCD presents two catalytic residues, His and Cys, in sequence;\nClan CE has a triad formed by His, Glu, or Asp and Cys at the C-terminus;\nin clan CF, the asparagine residue of the catalytic triad is replaced\nby a glutamate residue and the catalytic triad is ordered as Glu,\nCys, and His; clan CG has a dyad of two cysteine residues, and Clan\nCH presents a Cys, Thr, and His triad with the catalytic cysteine\nat the N-terminus.\n\nThe proteolytic mechanism involves the formation\nof a thiolate\u2013imidazolium\nion pair, which provides a highly nucleophilic cysteine thiol. Over\nthe years, many cysteine protease inhibitors have been designed by\nappropriately linking electrophilic warheads to the specific recognition\nsequence of peptide substrates. Reversible inhibitor warheads include\naldehydes, \u03b1-ketoamides, \u03b1-ketoesters, and \u03b1-ketoacids.\nThese inhibitors interact with the protease active site, forming the\ntetrahedral intermediate, but are eventually hydrolyzed, regenerating\nboth the enzyme and the inhibitor in an equilibrium reaction. Irreversible\ninhibitors of cysteine proteases include epoxides, aziridines, haloketones,\nvinyl sulfones, and acyloxymethylketones. These inhibitors inactivate\nthe target through alkylation of the active site cysteine thiol, permanently\ndisabling enzyme function.273,313,316\u2212318\n\nThe occurrence of severe acute respiratory\nsyndrome (SARS) in 2003\nand the subsequent identification of a novel coronavirus as the etiological\nagent recognized cysteine proteases SARS-CoV 3CLpro and SARS-CoV PLpro\n(papain-like protease) as possible targets for drug design.319,320 Subsequent structure-based design based on a previous inhibitor\u2019s\nX-ray co-crystal structure with the enzyme321 provided carbamate derivative 299 (Figure 29) as a potent SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitor (IC50 = 80 \u03bcM).322\n\nA wide\nvariety of human rhinovirus 3C (HRV 3C) protease inhibitors\nwere developed by the incorporation of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated\ncarbonyl moieties as warheads. Hanzlik et al. reported the first HRV\n3C protease inhibitors containing a peptide portion and incorporating\n\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated esters.323 The\npeptide parts were selected based on the substrate cleavage site.\nThe representative carbamate-containing inhibitor 300 (Figure 29) showed an IC50 value\nof 130 nM.\n\nHuman cathepsin K plays a critical role in bone resorption.\nIn\nan effort to block bone resorption, noncovalent cathepsin K inhibitors\nwere developed. Kim et al. provided carbamate derivative 301 (Figure 29) as a noncovalent and reversible\ncathepsin K (IC50 = 0.01 \u03bcM) and L inhibitor (IC50 = 0.002 \u03bcM).324 GlaxoWellcome\nscientists developed carbamate-containing ketoamide-based cathepsin\nK inhibitors such as 302 (Figure 29) (IC50 = 0.072 nM).325 Starting\nfrom a potent ketone-based inhibitor with unsatisfactory drug-like\nproperties,326,327 incorporation of P2\u2013P3 elements from the ketoamide-based inhibitor 302 led to a hybrid series of ketone-based cathepsin K inhibitors\nwith improved bioavailability, as exemplified in inhibitor 303 (Figure 29) (IC50 = 4 nM).328\n\nCathepsin S has been suggested for the\ndevelopment of agents against\na range of immune disorders. A new class of nonpeptidic and noncovalent\ncathepsin S inhibitors was reported in 2007.329 Subsequent structural optimization resulted in a very potent and\ncompetitive noncovalent carbamate-containing inhibitor 304 (Figure 29) (IC50 = 20 nM).\n\nCarbamates have been employed in the design\nof serine hydrolase\ninhibitiors. In this section, we will focus on inhibitors of endocannabinoid\nmetabolizing enzymes, in which the carbamate functionality plays an\nimportant role.\n\nThe endocannabinoid system is known to be a\nubiquitous neuromodulatory\nsystem with a wide range of action that can be found in every primitive\norganism. It is composed of cannabinoid receptors (CBRs), endogenous\ncannabinoids (endocannabinoids, ECs), and the enzymes responsible\nfor their production, transport, and degradation.330,331 ECs are a class of signaling lipids, such as N-arachidonoyl\nethanolamine (anandamide, AEA), oleamide, and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol\n(2-AG), that exert their biological actions through the interaction\nwith two G-protein coupled receptors, CB1 and CB2. They modulate a\nrange of responses and processes including pain, inflammation, appetite,\nmotility, sleep, thermoregulation, and cognitive and emotional states.332 The actions of these signaling lipids are rapidly\nterminated by cellular reuptake and subsequent hydrolysis operated\nby a number of enzymes. An attractive approach involved the modulation\nof the EC system and aimed at eliciting the desirable effects of CBRs\nactivation through the pharmacological inactivation of the main endocannabinoid\nmetabolizing enzymes, namely, monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) and \u03b1/\u03b2-hydrolase\ndomain containing 6 and 12 (ABHD6 and ABHD12). These three serine\nhydrolases account for approximately 99% of 2-AG hydrolysis in the\nCNS,333 whereas fatty acid amide hydrolase\n(FAAH) is responsible for AEA inactivation.330 Inactivation of these enzymes would elevate the endogenous concentrations\nof all of its substrate and consequently prolong and potentiate their\nbeneficial effects on pain and anxiety without evoking the classical\nCB1R agonists side effects (hypomotility, hypothermia, and catalepsy).\n\nMonoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is the primary enzyme responsible\nfor the hydrolysis of 2-AG in the CNS.333 About 85% of the total 2-AG hydrolysis in the brain is ascribed\nto MAGL. MAGL is a 33 kDa membrane enzyme belonging to the superfamily\nof the serine hydrolases with a catalytic triad represented by Ser122,\nHis269, and Asp239.334 It is ubiquitously\npresent in the brain (cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, thalamu, and\nstriatum), where it localizes to presynaptic terminals, even if lower\nlevels are found in the brainstem and hypothalamus. A concomitant\ndistribution in membranes as well as in the cytosol has been reported.\nMAGL shares a common folding motif called the \u03b1/\u03b2-hydrolase\nfold. Studies in recent years have shown that MAGL inhibitors elicit\nantinociceptive, anxiolytic, and antiemetic responses. MAGL inhibitors\nhave also been shown to exert anti-inflammatory action in the brain\nand protect against neurodegeneration through lowering eicosanoid\nproduction.335 Recently, the potential\nof MAGL inhibitors for the therapy of Fragile X syndrome has been\nreported.336 The early discovered MAGL\ninhibitors were molecules able to target the cysteine residues present\nin the active site of the enzyme. Later, the research has been focused\non the synthesis of compounds covalently binding to Ser241 of the\ncatalytic triad. Among them, carbamate 305 (URB602, Figure 30) was the first selective inhibitor of 2-AG degradation,\nalthough its potency remained limited (IC50 = 28 \u03bcM\non rat brain).337 Selective MAGL inhibitors\nbearing a carbamate scaffold were developed by Cravatt and co-workers.338 Inhibitor 306 (JZL184, Figure 30) exhibited selectivity toward FAAH in\nvitro (IC50 = 3.9 nM and 4 \u03bcM for human\nrecombinant MAGL and FAAH, respectively).338 More recently, Cravatt and co-workers reported a distinct class\nof O-hexafluoroisopropyl (HFIP) carbamates bearing\na reactive group that is bioisosteric with endocannabinoid substrates.339 The representative compound, 307 (KML29, Figure 30, IC50 = 5.9\nnM, human MAGL), displays excellent potency and in vivo. In comparison to previously described O-aryl carbamates,\ninhibitor showed enhanced selectivity over FAAH and other serine hydrolases.339\n\nABHD6 gene encodes a \u223c35 kDa protein\ncontaining an N-terminal\ntransmembrane region followed by a catalytic domain that includes\nthe canonical GXSXG active-site motif of serine hydrolases. ABHD6\nis a unique and highly conserved enzyme in mammals and is mainly expressed\nin the brain, liver, kidney, and brown adipose tissue. As a member\nof the serine hydrolase class, ABHD6 is predicted to hydrolyze esters,\namides, or thioester bonds in substrates that could include small\nmolecules, lipids, or peptides. Although, the full range of substrates\nregulated by this enzyme in vivo is currently unknown.340 Recent studies have also shown that ABHD6 carbamate\ninhibitors produce anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in\na mouse model of traumatic brain injury.341 Among them, optimized inhibitor 308 (Figure 30) displayed an IC50 value of 70 nM and\nnotable selectivity.342\n\nFAAH is a\nmembrane-bound enzyme belonging to the amidase family.\nThe analysis of its crystal structure revealed a core composed of\na characteristic Ser-Ser-Lys catalytic triad.343 The catalytic residues of FAAH are buried deep within the\nenzyme and are accessible by two narrow channels. The importance of\nFAAH was demonstrated by the generation of FAAH knockout mice. FAAH\u2013/\u2013 mice showed an elevated resting brain concentration\nof AEA and manifested (i) an analgesic phenotype in both the carrageenan\nmodel of inflammatory pain and in the formalin model of spontaneous\npain,344 (ii) a reduction in inflammatory\nresponses,345 and (iii) improvements in\nslow wave sleep and memory acquisition.346,347 The URB class of compounds was the first class of inhibitors identified\nfor FAAH, and it is well-represented by 309 (URB597,\nFigure 30, IC50 = 4.6 nM).348 The N-(6-phenyl)hexylcarbamate\nanalogue 310 (JP83, Figure 30,\nIC50 = 14 nM) is another very potent compound representative\nof the biphenyl series of inhibitors.349 Gattinoni and co-workers developed a series of oxime carbamate inhibitors.\nCompound 311 (Figure 30, IC50 = 8 nM) displayed good affinity and selectivity toward FAAH.350 More recently, Butini et al. developed a new\nclass of potent and selective FAAH reversible carbamate inhibitors.351 Among them, compound 312 (NF1245,\nFigure 30, Ki = 0.16 nM on mouse brain FAAH) showed excellent\nactivity. The compound showed impressive selectivity toward all the\nenzymes and receptors of the endocannabinoid system.351\n\nIn\nthis Perspective, the role of carbamates in drug design and\nmedicinal chemistry has been highlighted. In particular, the Perspective\ncovers physical properties of carbamates and the development of novel\nchemical methodologies overcoming the historical safety and toxicity\nissues related to their preparation. Furthermore, the importance of\ncarbamate-derived compounds in medicinal chemistry and their widespread\nemployment as drugs and prodrugs have been discussed. Also showcased\nis the exploitation of organic carbamates in the development of numerous\naspartic acid, serine, and cysteine protease inhibitors. We hope that\nthis Perspective will stimulate further use of organic carbamate as\na structural motif in drug design and medicinal chemistry."}
