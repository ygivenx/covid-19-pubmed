{"title": "Interplay between co-divergence and cross-species transmission in the evolutionary history of bat coronaviruses", "body": "Since the isolation of Hendra virus from pteropid bats in 2000 (Halpin et al., 2000) , bats have been implicated in the emergence of a number of other human infectious diseases, most notably Nipah, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Ebola (Calisher et al., 2006; Moratelli and Calisher, 2015) . In turn, the notion that these viral diseases likely have their ultimate ancestry in bats triggered a major increase in the sampling of bat viruses, leading to the progressive uncovering of a diverse bat virome and further fueling the idea that these animals are major reservoirs of emerging pathogens (Moratelli and Calisher, 2015; Young and Olival, 2016) .\n\nSuccessful cross-species transmission and emergence depends on a variety of biological, ecological and epidemiological factors. Although RNA viruses commonly jump species boundaries, in part reflecting their ability to rapidly generate important adaptive variation (Geoghegan et al., 2017; Holmes, 2009; Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005) , coronaviruses (CoVs) seem to exhibit a strong zoonotic potential and demonstrated by the emergence SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in humans in 2002 and 2012, respectively (Graham et al., 2013) . Coronaviruses are single-strand RNA viruses of the order Nidovirales that are classified in four genera: Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma and Deltacoronavirus. Among these, gamma and delta CoVs are largely associated with avian hosts, while alpha and beta CoVs include several pathogens of humans and domestic animals, and whose emergence is likely associated with crossspecies transmission events (Drexler et al., 2014) .\n\nBoth SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV belong to the genus Betacoronavirus and are associated with severe lower respiratory tract infection characterized by mortality rates of 10% and 35%, respectively (Hu et al., 2015) . The SARS pandemic was promptly controlled through an unprecedented global containment effort and the virus has not been reported in humans since May 2004 (Graham et al., 2013) . Despite this rapid eradication, SARS-CoV caused almost 800 deaths in 27 countries, with sustained outbreaks in 18 countries on three continents (WHO). There is increasing evidence that rhinolophid bats act as natural reservoirs for SARS-related CoVs, with direct spill-over to non-flying mammals. For example, like the SARS coronavirus, some bat CoVs are able to utilize the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell receptor (Ge et al., 2014; Menachery et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2016; Zeng et al., 2016) . Conversely, the role of bats in the epidemiology of MERS-CoV is less well understood as the human viruses are clearly mostly related to those viruses found in dromedary camels (Sabir et al., 2016) . Indeed, although related viruses have been found in bats, these are divergent in their spike sequences and seem to be inefficient in the use of human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) as cell a receptor (Anthony et al., 2017a; Reusken et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2014) . The MERS epidemic is ongoing in the Middle East and travel-associated cases have been reported in 27 countries worldwide (WHO, 2017) . Finally, Alphacoronavirus 229E and NL63, which cause a mild influenza-like syndrome in humans, share a common ancestor with viruses sampled from the bat genus Hipposideros and Triaenops, respectively (Corman et al., 2015 (Corman et al., , 2016 Tao et al., 2017) .\n\nBats are known to harbor high levels of CoV diversity with impressive geographical range and prevalence in almost every species investigated, again supporting the idea that they have played a major role in CoV evolution (Anthony et al., 2017b; Drexler et al., 2014) . In addition, bat CoVs are phylogenetically interspersed with those associated with other mammals, including humans and domestic species, compatible with the idea that bats are an important genetic reservoir (Tao et al., 2017; Woo et al., 2012) . The long-term evolutionary interactions between bats and coronaviruses is also supported by phylogenetic evidence that CoVs exhibit some species-and genus-specific tropism (Cui et al., 2007; Vijaykrishna et al., 2007) , and that phylogenetically related viruses are found in related bat species independent of sampling location. In contrast, that CoVs are not always shared among bat species that co-roost suggests that there are some barriers to cross-species transmission (Anthony et al., 2013; Corman et al., 2013; Cui et al., 2007; Drexler et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2006) .\n\nBecause of the topological similarity between the phylogenetic trees of CoVs and their mammalian hosts, it has been suggested that the diversity of CoVs largely reflects the long-term co-divergence between bats and CoVs (Cui et al., 2007) . However, recent studies on specific bat taxa from particular locations suggests that the role of virus-host codivergence in the evolutionary history of CoVs may have been overestimated relative to other events including host-jumping (Anthony et al., 2017b; Lin et al., 2017; Tao et al., 2017) . Indeed, as well as strict virus-host co-divergence, topological congruence could also arise from preferential host switching, in which viruses most often successfully jump from closely related hosts (De Vienne et al., 2013) . The analysis of the long-term evolutionary history of bat CoVs is also complicated by frequent multiple substitution at deep evolutionary distances that prevents the accurate estimation of divergence times (Wertheim et al., 2013) .\n\nTo obtain a more complete picture of the evolutionary history of alpha and beta coronaviruses in their natural hosts, which is essential for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of virus emergence, we performed a statistical analysis of co-phylogenetic relationships on a large data set of mammalian CoVs. Not only did this suggest that crossspecies transmission has played a major role in the evolution of alpha and beta CoVs in bats, but also that differences in bat host ecology, biology and geographical range have a strong impact on coronavirus evolution.\n\nWe retrieved all bat CoV sequences representing the partial ORF1b that encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) available on GenBank (as of March 2017). These were combined with 109 CoV sequences from other mammals. Two gamma CoVs were used to root the phylogeny. Only sequences > 350 bp in length and associated with a bat genus for which at least two sequences were available were retained. Unique sequences associated with a particular species were included, but solely used for analyses based on the host genus. Similarly, we retrieved CoV sequences encoding the spike (S) protein, including those from bats and 46 CoV sequences sampled from other mammals. For each CoV sequence we recorded the collection date, location and host (genus and species) based on information available in GenBank and/or in the associated literature. CoV sequences for which the sampling location and/or host genus were unavailable were discarded. Sampling locations were retrieved at the country level, and were categorized according to their large-scale geographic area of sampling: Europe, Africa, North America, Latin America (Central and South America), Asia, South East Asia, and Australia.\n\nThe most comprehensive CoV data set encoding the RdRp (denoted \"RdRp_CoV_1\") comprised 541 CoV sequences from bats plus 111 sequences from other mammalian genera, including three randomly chosen representatives of known monophyletic groups of CoVs as well as all unclassified mammalian sequences. This data set was used for the phylogenetic and host clustering analyses (see below). CoV sequences encoding the spike protein comprised a data set, denoted \"spike_CoV\", which included 199 sequences from bats plus 46 CoV sequences from other mammals.\n\nWe also constructed sub-sampled data sets from the comprehensive RdRp_CoV_1 data set based on results from the genus-specific clustering (see below) to minimize errors associated with the non-independence of data. Specifically, reduced data sets CoV (n = 58), CoV\u03b1 (n = 34) and CoV\u03b2 (n = 24) included the longest sequence for each genus-specific cluster. These reduced data sets were used in the co-phylogenetic analysis (see below).\n\nTo help assess the validity of our results we constructed a second group of data sets (\"data sets_2\") which only included sequences from bat hosts whose species was confirmed genetically (and hence more confidently), thereby removing any error due to host misclassification. These data sets were termed RdRp_CoV_2 (n = 42 sequences), which was used for phylogenetic and host clustering analyses, and CoV_2 (n = 11), CoV_2\u03b1 (n = 8), CoV_2\u03b2 (n = 3) and host_2, used in the cophylogenetic analysis (see below).\n\nHost sequences targeting the full mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) gene were also retrieved from GenBank and visually inspected to ensure that they agreed with previously published bat phylogenies. The host data set (denoted \"host\") included one cytb gene sequence for each genus associated with the CoV data set.\n\nAll sequences were aligned with MAFFT utilizing the L-INS-i routine (Katoh et al., 2002) , manually adjusted. Longer sequences were then trimmed to 935 bp (RdRp) and 1440 bp (spike protein) using MEGA6 (Tamura et al., 2013) . Sequence alignments utilized nucleotide sequences for the host, CoV, CoV\u03b1 and CoV\u03b2 data sets and all the data sets_2, amino acid sequences for the spike_CoV data set, and both nucleotide and amino acid sequences for the comprehensive data set RdRp_CoV_1. Best-fit models of nucleotide and amino acid substitution for each data set were determined using MEGA6 (Tamura et al., 2013) . Pairwise genetic distances among nucleotide and amino acid sequences were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method in MEGA6.\n\nMaximum likelihood nucleotide phylogenetic trees were inferred using PhyML (version 3.0), employing the GTR + \u0413 4 substitution model, a heuristic SPR branch-swapping algorithm and 1000 bootstrap replicates (Dereeper et al., 2008) . Similarly, amino acid ML trees were estimated for data sets RdRp_CoV_1 and spike_CoV using RAXML (version 8.1.17) assuming the LG + \u0393 4 and the LG + \u0393 4 + I models of amino acid substitution, respectively, and 1000 bootstrap replicates.\n\nTopological congruence between the RdRp and spike-based amino acid trees was determined based on the phylogenies of RdRp and spike sequences derived from the same host taxa. To implement the phylogeny trait methods which require a posterior distribution of phylogenetic trees (see below), we inferred non-clock Bayesian trees for data set RdRp_CoV_1 using MrBayes v3.2.4 (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2003) and assuming the GTR + \u0413 4 nucleotide substitution model. This analysis was run for 70 million generations (25% discarded as burn-in) and sampled every 500 generations. The resultant tree was then edited using iTOL (Letunic and Bork, 2016) .\n\nFinally, the degree of temporal signal (i.e. clock-like structure) in these CoV data was explored by plotting root-to-tip genetic distances on the ML trees against year of sampling using the method implemented in TempEst (Rambaut et al., 2016) .\n\nWe first investigated whether coronaviruses showed significant clustering by bat host genus/species or sampling location using the association index (AI), parsimony score (PS) and maximum monophyletic clade (MC) phylogeny-trait statistics available in the BaTS package (Parker et al., 2008) . This analysis compared the posterior distribution of trees for data set RdRp_CoV_1 described above to a null distribution of 100 trait-randomized trees, with bat large-scale geographic area and country of sampling, bat genus, and bat species assigned as the character states of interest. The extent of clustering associated with the characters \"host genus\" and \"host species\" was investigated also in the reduced data set RdRp_CoV_2. In addition, we used the phylogenetic tree to identify bat RdRp genus-specific clusters of CoVs, defined as a minimum of two monophyletic RdRp sequences associated with the same bat genus, supported by Bayesian posterior probabilities > 0.90 and differing no > 4.8% and 5.1% at the amino acid level for the genera Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus, respectively (see below).\n\nThe taxonomy of CoV clusters was determined based on pairwise amino acid distances calculated using 816 bp of the RdRp, when available, and reflecting the RdRp Group Units (RGU) defined previously for CoVs (Drexler et al., 2014) . Following these criteria, we assigned distinctive RGUs to sequences differing by at least 4.8% and 5.1% at the amino acid level for the genera Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus, respectively (Drexler et al., 2014) .\n\nTo assess the extent of virus-host co-divergence in the data we reconciled the CoV and host phylogenies using Jane 4.0 (Conow et al., 2010) , which infers the nature and frequency of different evolutionary scenarios by finding the reconciliation with the lowest total cost. Accordingly, we assigned event costs = 1 for virus lineage duplication, host shift, and virus loss, or failure to diverge following host speciation, and costs of both 0 and 1 for co-divergence. Jane was run for 45 generations (G) with a set size of 23 (S). This analysis used the tree topologies based on RdRp and cytb for coronaviruses and their hosts, respectively. In addition, the congruence between the phylogeny of bat genera and their CoV clusters was depicted graphically using the tanglegram function of the DECIPHER package (Wright, 2016) from the R environment. To exclude the impact of possible host misclassification, this analysis was also run for datasets_2 in which hosts are assigned genetically.\n\nSequences included within bat RdRp genus-specific clusters of CoVs but associated with different host genera were considered as likely cross-species transmission events. For each such event we determined whether cross-species transmission was associated with the following variables: host taxonomy (genus, family and superfamily) of the donor and recipient hosts, CoV lineage, sampling location, sampling year, sampling location, and sampling year and location of the most closely related sequence.\n\nTo tentatively determine whether there may have been a sustained chain of CoV transmission in the new host species (as opposed to transient spill-overs), we assessed whether sequences associated with cross-species transmission events were significantly divergent from the donor cluster. Accordingly, for each putative cross-species transmission event, we compared the median nucleotide distance among sequences from the donor host with the median nucleotide distances between the donor sequences and those from the novel (i.e. recipient) host using a one-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test. Genetic distances were again calculated using MEGA6 (Tamura et al., 2013) as described above. Although this analysis was based on the RdRp, spike protein sequences were also used when available.\n\nThe Spearman coefficient (rs) was used to determine the strength of the correlation between CoV diversity, expressed as number of detected CoV clusters, and the species richness or geographical range of CoV samples for each host genus. To test the influence of sampling effort on CoV diversity, the same correlation coefficient was determined between CoV diversity and the number of GenBank submissions and the total number of sequences per genus. Absolute values were (arbitrarily) interpreted as follows: 0.00-0.39 \"weak\" correlation, 0.40-0.59 \"moderate\" correlation, 0.60-0.79 \"strong\" correlation, and 0.80-1.0 \"very strong\" correlation. Coefficients were considered significant for pvalue < 0.05.\n\nA total of 650 CoV RdRp sequences were analyzed in this study. Among these, 541 were from bats (307 Alphacoronavirus and 234 Betacoronavirus), representing most of the CoV diversity currently described in bats, and 111 from other mammalian species (57 Alphacoronavirus, 50 Betacoronavirus and two Gammacoronavirus, with the latter used as outgroups) (data set \"RdRp_CoV_1\"). Sequence lengths generally ranged from 350 bp to 816 bp (n = 352), although a number (n = 298) were longer and trimmed to 935 bp prior to analysis (Table 1) . Similarly, we analyzed 245 spike protein sequences, including 199 sequences from bats and 46 from other mammals. Sequence lengths ranged from 678 bp (including the receptor-binding domain RBD) and~4000 bp corresponding to the full length sequence. For 94 bat CoVs both the RdRp and the spike protein sequences were available (Table 1) . Although bat sequences obtained were identified worldwide, most came from Asia (n = 252 in five countries), Africa (n = 170 in six countries) and Europe (n = 116 in nine countries) (Fig. 1) .\n\nBat-derived CoV sequences (either RdRp or spike) were sampled from 82 different species belonging to 25 genera (Table 1) . Importantly, information on the criteria used for the classification of bat species in the data set was often lacking (69.5%); in some cases, classification was based on morphology (55.4%), and to a lesser extent on genetic identification (17.1%). Of note, 36 of the bats under study (representing 12 genera) are considered cryptic species as they are morphologically indistinguishable from other sympatric species (Table S1 ). In 18 cases, the host classification provided with the CoV sequence identified the host genus only, while in one case (H. caffer_ruber) the exact species was not defined (Pfefferle et al., 2009) . Therefore, to help assess the robustness of our results, we performed a second analysis on 42 sequences for which the bat host species was confirmed genetically (data set RdRp_CoV_2), among which 26 were Alphacoronavirus and 16 were Betacoronavirus.\n\nPhylogenetic analyses revealed a structuring of bat coronavirus diversity dependent on both their host taxa and the large-scale geographic area of sampling (Fig. 2) . With the exception of CoV sequences associated with Alphacoronavirus 1, Mink coronavirus 1, Human coronavirus HKU1 and Betacoronavirus 1, all other CoVs from non-flying mammals formed clades that either exhibited sister relationships with bat-associated viruses or were nested within them (Fig. 2) . Regression analyses revealed no correlation between sampling times and root-totip genetic distances for both the RdRp and spike proteins (R 2 = 0.0078 and 0.0075 for the RdRp_CoV_1 and spike_CoV data sets, respectively) thereby precluding any molecular clock dating (Fig. S1A, B) .\n\nPhylogeny-trait analyses based on RdRp sequences using the BaTS program provided statistical support (p < 0.01) for the clustering of CoVs in all the traits investigated. The percentage of individual traits significantly (i.e. < 0.05) supporting CoV clustering was 100% for \"large-scale geographic area of sampling\", 88.46% for \"bat genus\", 77.4% for \"country of sampling\", and 75.4% for \"bat species\" (Table  S2 ). Individual traits represented by unique sequences (e.g. single countries) always gave non-significant results and were excluded from the overall percentages given above. A similar trend was confirmed for sequences associated with genetically defined host species (data set RdRp_CoV_2), for which clustering was significant in 80% of host genera and 50% of host species (Table S3) .\n\nOur phylogenetic analyses identified 44 RdRp bat genus-specific clusters, 28 in the alpha CoVs (denoted C1\u03b1-C28\u03b1) and 16 in the beta CoVs (denoted C29\u03b2-C44\u03b2) (Fig. 2) . As expected, sequences from NL63, CoV 229E and SARS CoV from other mammalian hosts fell within batassociated clusters (between C26\u03b1 and C27\u03b1, within C26\u03b1 and within C36\u03b2, and associated with bats belonging to the genera Trianops, Hipposideros and Rhinolophus, respectively) (Fig. 2) . Conversely, it was not possible to identify species-specific or geographically structured clusters across all bat genera. This was particularly evident for clusters of CoVs found in the bat genera Miniopterus, Rhinolophus and Hipposideros associated with different host species sampled from different geographical macro-areas (Fig. 2) . That these results were not due to errors in host classification was confirmed by phylogenetic analyses of data set RdRp_CoV_2, which also revealed a clustering by host genus rather than host species (Fig. S2) .\n\nA single CoV phylogenetic cluster was associated with most bat genera. However, two or three clusters were observed in Artibeus, Rousettus, Hipposideros, Triaenops, Rhinolophus, Eptesicus and Miniopterus, and more than three clusters were present in Myotis and Pipistrellus. The bat genera Pipistrellus, Eptesicus, Rhinolophus and Hipposideros were associated with both alpha and beta CoVs, while all genera of fruit bats (the Pteropodidae) were found to only harbor beta-CoVs assigned to lineage D (Table 1, Fig. 2 ). The number of host species included within genus-specific clusters varied between one and 10, with the most observed in Rhinolphus (n = 10), Miniopterus (n = 7) and Hipposideros (n = 4) ( Table 2) .\n\nA strong correlation was observed between the number of RdRp specific clusters described for each bat genus and either its species richness (rs = 0.69, p = 0.0001) or geographic distribution (rs = 0.67, Fig. 2 . Phylogenetic overview of CoV sequences analyzed here. The tree reflects a Bayesian analysis of 935 bp of the RdRp gene (data set RdRp_CoV_1), rooted using two sequences from gamma coronaviruses (GenBank accession numbers EF584911-2). Genus specific clusters identified in our study are colored based on the host genus, as indicated. Posterior probabilities > 0.90 supporting each cluster are shown. Branch lengths are scaled according to the number of substitutions per site. The three bars around the tree show the frequency within each cluster of (i) host genera, (ii) host species and (iii) sampling locations, from the innermost to the most exterior. Sequences showing characters with frequency < 10%, between 10 and 50%, and > 50% are colored black, grey and light grey, respectively. For the \"host species\" bar, only sequences belonging to the host genus characterizing the cluster (frequency > 50%) have been colored; sequences associated with hosts only characterized at the genus level are indicated in yellow. The ICTV classification of virus clusters is indicated when available. The figure was generated using iTOL. p = 0.0002). However, the correlations between CoV diversity and the number of GenBank submissions and the total number of CoV sequences within each bat genus were also very strong (rs = 0.64, p = 0.0006; rs = 0.73, p < 0.0001). Hence, it is possible that these sampling biases have had a strong impact on the results.\n\nThe majority of genus-specific clusters (32/44) originated from a single large-scale geographic area. Of the remaining 12/44 clusters showing a broader geographical spread, 11 were identified in two or three geographic areas and one in more than three geographic areas (Table 2, Fig. 2 ). Of note is the frequent clustering of coronaviruses from Asia and South-East Asia (China and Thailand) associated with Miniopterus (C10-11\u03b1), Hipposideros (C9\u03b1, C27\u03b2) and Schotophilus (C16\u03b1) ( Table 2) .\n\nThe availability of RdRp sequences > 816 bp enabled the classification of 27/44 genus-specific clusters using the RdRp group units (RGU) previously defined for CoVs (Drexler et al., 2010 ) (C2\u03b1-C5\u03b1, C7\u03b1-C11\u03b1, C15\u03b1-C16\u03b1, C18\u03b1, C20\u03b1, C25\u03b1-C28\u03b1, C30\u03b2, C33\u03b2, C35\u03b2-C40\u03b2, C43\u03b2-C44\u03b2) ( Table 3) . The taxonomy of all other clusters was not resolved due to short fragment lengths. In all but two cases, the pairwise amino acid distance between sequences > 816 bp was consistent with the association between RdRp genus-specific clusters identified in this study and distinct RGUs. The exceptions, C18\u03b1 and C20\u03b1, both associated with Myotis bats, and C43\u03b2 and C44\u03b2, associated with Pipistrellus and Eptesicus, respectively, shared 96% similarity at the amino acid level in 816 bp of RdRp and hence should be classified as a single RGU (Table 3) . Mean nucleotide divergence between sequences from Eptesicus and Pipistrellus was 39.3% (SE = 0.11), compared to only 1.6% (SE = 0.005) mean divergence within sequences from Pipistrellus bats only. Interestingly, our analyses identified these RdRp genus-specific clusters as belonging to the same putative species of MERS-CoV, with amino acid identities of 98.2% and 96.3%, respectively (Table 3) .\n\nSpike protein sequences were available for 17/44 RdRp genus-specific clusters (C2\u03b1, C7\u03b1, C9\u03b1-C11\u03b1, C16\u03b1, C18\u03b1, C25\u03b1, C28\u03b1, C30\u03b2, C33\u03b2, C35\u03b2-C40\u03b2), all of which were taxonomically resolved based on RGU classification (Table 3) . Mean amino acid divergence in spike sequences from CoVs included within the same RGU ranged from 0.46% (C39\u03b2) to 48.29% (C37\u03b2) ( Table 3) . Tree topologies based on the spike protein sequences were largely consistent with RdRp clustering detected in this study (Fig. S3) . However, there were discordant tree topologies between the RdRp and spike proteins for the two clusters associated with miniopterus bats which did not cluster together in the latter, with mean amino acid divergence of 42.4% (SE = 0.01) in the spike protein compared to only 6.8% (0.013) for the RdRp (Figs. S3, 2, Table 3 ). Furthermore, three sequences from Miniopterus fuliginosus (accession numbers KJ473800, KJ473799, KJ473797) belonging to RdRp genus-specific cluster C10\u03b1 fell into spike protein cluster C11\u03b1 (Fig. S3) . A similar pattern was observed for C30\u03b2 associated with rousettus bats; these fell within cluster 33\u03b2 on the RdRp tree but were distinct from it in the spike protein tree (Figs. S3, 2) . Finally, our analyses confirmed a different evolutionary history for the spike protein of human Coronavirus NL63; this grouped with CoVs from hipposideros bats (C28\u03b1) and human Coronavirus 229E rather than being nested within sequences from bats of the genus Trienops (RdRp genus-specific cluster C26\u03b1 and C27\u03b1) as seen in the RdRp phylogenies (Figs. S3, 2) .\n\nDespite the likely antiquity of CoVs in bats, genus-specific clusters showed a low level of phylogenetic congruence in respect to their hosts (Fig. S4) . Indeed, a full reconciliation analysis (using Jane) suggested that the evolutionary history of CoVs was best explained by more frequent cross-species transmission than co-divergence, with the latter accounting for 0-18.3% of all the events observed (Table 4 ). For example, across the CoVs as a whole, there were 0-11 co-divergence events compared to 38-47 host-shift events. Importantly, this result was independent of the cost associated with co-divergence (assigned as either equal or lower than that associated with cross-species transmission) and was the same when the alpha and beta CoVs were analyzed independently, such that there was no difference in the frequency of cross-species transmission between these viral groups. Equivalent results were obtained using the genetically confirmed hosts in data sets_2 (Table S4) .\n\nA total of 27 CoV sequences were identified as likely cross-species Table 3 Amino acid diversity within and between clusters based on the RdRp and the spike protein, expressed as percentages (with SE).

These cross-species transmission events involved 20 different combinations of recipient and donor hosts (13 recipient and eight donor genera, respectively), among which the association between Cynopterus and Hipposideros was bi-directional. In five cases, cross-species transmission events involved more than one highly similar CoV from the same recipient bat species. Up to six cross-species transmissions were recorded for a single donor host, with the highest frequency in clusters associated with the genera Miniopterus, Hipposideros and Rhinolophus (Table 5 ). In 17/27 cases recipient and donor hosts belonged to different bat superfamilies. Notably, the bats involved in cross-species transmission were largely sampled from the same geographic location, with a sharing of roosts between host species documented in only 6/27 cases and possible in 13/27 (Table 5 ). In only two cases did cross-species transmission involve related hosts from different geographical areas, namely phyllostomidae bats of the genera Carollia and Artibeus sampled in Costa Rica and Panama, respectively, and bats of the genera Miniopterus and Eptesicus from China and USA, both belonging to the superfamily Vespertilionoidea. Unfortunately, the host classification was not confirmed genetically for any of these events so that more accurate analyses could not be performed. Sequences identified as likely cross-species transmissions were generally located at tree tips and were not significantly divergent from those of their putative donor cluster suggesting that they most likely represent recent host jumps (p > 0.05 in 21/27 cases) (Table 5) . Among sequences exhibiting divergence from the donor cluster, 4/6 were sampled from related hosts, belonging at least to the same superfamily.\n\nSpike sequences were available for 3/27 CoVs identified as crossspecies transmission events, involving jumps from the bat genera Hipposideros to Rousettus and from Rhinolophus to Chaerepon. Interestingly, spike protein sequences from rousettus bats were significantly divergent from hipposideros CoVs and constituted a sister group to those from this genus (Table 5) . Although this is compatible with host adaptation, this clearly needs to be investigated in greater detail.\n\nAlpha and beta coronaviruses exhibit both substantial genetic diversity and a wide geographical range in bats, such that these mammals are important virus hosts (Anthony et al., 2017b; Drexler et al., 2014) . Our data indicate that bats are indeed associated with several distinct clusters of alpha and beta CoVs, and that most CoVs from non-flying mammals also fell within these clusters on phylogenetic trees. However, we also noted the existence of monophyletic groups of CoVs associated with mammalian species other than bats, such as Alphacoronavirus 1 and Betacoronavirus 1. Interestingly, we revealed a positive association between CoV diversity and the species richness and geographical Table 4 Frequency of different evolutionary scenarios following co-phylogenetic reconciliation analysis (Jane) of the full set of sequences. Results are shown assuming equal or lower costs for codivergence compared to the other possible evolutionary events. (Fenton and Simmons, 2015; Woo et al., 2012) , and supports the central role for these animals in CoV evolution. Furthermore, we detected a strong impact of sampling effort on CoV diversity, suggesting that this still likely underestimated in bats as a whole (Anthony et al., 2017b) . Our data also provide evidence for the close phylogenetic relationship of coronaviruses from hosts of the same genus, with distinct putative CoV species tending to be associated with different bat genera. Indeed, single RGUs (which are considered indicative of distinctive CoV species) were associated with more than one bat species, particularly in those bats that live sympatrically or that belong to the same genus. Similarly, despite the evidence for geographical structuring, CoVs belonging to the same RGUs were also described in different locations, as previously described (Leopardi et al., 2016) . Hence, as a general rule, CoVs exhibit genus-specificity rather than species-specificity. Conversely, CoV clusters associated with bat genera Pipistrellus and Eptesicus showed low divergence at the amino acid level based on the 816 bp fragment, suggesting their classification within the same CoV putative species. Interestingly, these clusters were also highly similar to MERS-CoV, such that they may be included within a single CoV species, although more data are needed to confirm this hypothesis.\n\nIt was notable that co-specific Miniopterus, Rousettus, Pipistrellus, Rhinolophus and Hipposideros bats sampled from the same location harbor more than one CoV cluster, which will increase the likelihood of virus recombination (Parrish et al., 2008) . This hypothesis is supported by our finding of discordant topologies between trees estimated using the RdRp and the spike protein for CoVs detected in Rousettus and Miniopterus bats and thereby supporting previous results (Huang et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2015) . In this context, it is noteworthy that bats from the genera Pipistrellus, Rhinolophus and Hipposideros are also those that show the highest identity with three human coronaviruses, namely MERS CoV, SARS CoV and hCoV 229E, respectively.\n\nA key observation of our study was the frequency with which crossspecies transmission has occurred in the evolution history of coronaviruses, reflected in the general incongruence between the virus and host phylogenies, the lack of species-specificity, and the presence of phylogenetically divergent viruses in some bat genera suggesting multiple introductions of CoVs (Cui et al., 2007) . This hypothesis is consistent with the finding of highly related CoVs in different species nonflying mammals; for example, feline coronavirus (FCoV) and canine coronavirus (CCoV) define two sister clades within the Alphacoronavirus 1 species, and are likely a result of recent interspecies jumping (Woo et al., 2009) .\n\nDespite the frequency of cross-species transmission, it was striking that only one recent host-jump between different bat genera was confirmed in our data set. This involved two distinct clusters of CoVs from closely related Vespertilionid bats from the genera Pipistrellus and Eptesicus, likely associated with the same CoV species. The availability of spike sequences also allowed us to identify a clear diversification of CoVs in bats of the genus Rousettus following their jump from a donor cluster associated with the co-roosting bat genus Hipposideros. Conversely, however, our data suggest that cross-species transmissions between distantly related hosts often result in transient spill-over infections, reflected as an absence of daughter lineages in phylogenetic trees (although this may also reflect a lack of appropriate sampling).\n\nThe multiple introductions of CoVs in Rhinopomatidae bats suggests that cross-species transmission events may be favored by their ecology of sharing roosts with different species, including Myotis, Miniopterus and Rousettus bats. However, it is important to note that we also detected cross-species transmission events between species for which no interaction is suspected based on their ecologies, such as the fruit bats Eidolon helvum that mainly roost in big colonies in trees, and the cave dwelling insectivorous bat Miniopterus natalensis (Fenton and Simmons, 2015) . Although this suggests that we have not sampled the key intermediate species, we necessarily cannot exclude cross-contamination or incorrect classification of hosts as confounding factor in these cases.\n\nOverall, our results confirm the long-term evolution of mammalian coronaviruses within bats, seemingly representing a complex interplay between co-divergence and cross-species transmission, a pattern that is seeming common among RNA viruses (Geoghegan et al., 2017) . In addition, we found evidence that likelihood cross-species transmission increased with sympatry.\n\nDespite its large-scale, this study has several limitations, mostly related to the quality of the available data. Of particular note is the short length of most fragments of coronaviruses used for analyses, with less than half compressing the 816 bp necessary for RGU classification (Drexler et al., 2010) , and which obviously limit phylogenetic resolution. Similarly, the uncertain classification of certain host species should not be underestimated, due to variable species assignments as well as the cryptic nature of several bat species that cannot be readily identified based on obvious morphological features but whose correct assignation often require the use of genetic or echolocation studies (Kingston et al., 2001) (Table S1 ). Indeed, the hosts included in our database represent only about 20% of the bat species (6% of the bat genera) described worldwide. Studies of CoV diversity have mainly been performed in China and Europe, while important hot spots for bat biodiversity (Richardson, 2002) , such as South East Asia and Latin America, are under-represented. Furthermore, sequences collected from different areas are generally weakly representative for their specific continent with, for example, most African samples being collected from Ghana and Kenya (Fig. 1) . While the reliability of our conclusions was confirmed by analyses performed on a much smaller data set with more accurate host assignments, we encourage a more comprehensive sampling, the collection of longer CoV sequences, and the accurate genetic attribution of the host species, all of which provide the information needed to better reveal the evolution and ecology of coronaviruses in bats.\n\nSupplementary data to this article can be found online at https:// doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2018.01.012."}
