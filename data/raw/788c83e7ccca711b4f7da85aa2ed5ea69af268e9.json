The duration that these \"social distancing\" measures were kept in place correlated with a reduced total mortality burden 4 . Although we still have no known effective therapy or vaccine prevention for this coronavirus, and the world is a quite different place than it was 100 years ago, the efficacy of the measures instituted during the 1918-19 pandemic gives us hope that the current measures will also limit the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBecause it is caused by a novel virus, the current pandemic has created plenty of anxiety, much of it due to the understandable fear of the unknown. We do not know how long this pandemic will last, and what its toll on communities will be in terms of fatalities, psychological, physical and economic well-being. Mathematical models using available data predict widely different outcomes, but worst-case scenarios, which have to be taken into account, predict the potential for millions of infected patients with an unacceptably high number of fatalities. The problem with such modelling is not only that different models make different projections, but that the basic assumptions about the virus, based on which these models were developed are far from certain. This is especially true for the two most basic values that predict the spread and impact of a virus: its basic reproductive number (R0) and its case fatality rate (CFR). The basic reproductive number (R0) is the number of secondary cases that one case would produce in a susceptible community. The value of R0 usually decreases during an outbreak of infection, as the susceptible population decreases, and measures to prevent the transmission are established.\n\nR0 values over 1 indicate a propensity for the infection to spread, while R0 lower than 1 indicate that the infection is likely to die out. The other important number is the CFR, which is calculated by dividing the number of deaths caused by the disease by the number of patients affected with that disease. For COVID-19, this number also varies greatly and is impacted by under-testing, the under-reporting of mild and asymptomatic cases, and the focus on more severe cases. This may be, at least in part, the reason why the CFR is much higher in studies from the Wuhan province, where it was 2.3%, than in studies from elsewhere in China that show a CFR around 1% 5 . The case fatality rate is usually quoted to be around 2% and is similar in China 6 , Iran 7 and Italy 8 . However, it varies between 0.25% and 3%, and lower estimates may be closer to the true value 9, 10 . The estimated infection fatality risk (IFR), i.e. the risk of death among all infected individuals (including those with no apparent disease) is 0.3% to 0.6%, which is comparable to the Asian influenza pandemic of 1957-1958 11 . However, other influenza pandemics had very different mortality rates and ranged from 0.001-0.007% for the 2009 H1N1 influenza to estimates ranging from 0.5 to 3% 12, 13 for the 1918 influenza pandemic. The high mortality rate of the 1918 influenza pandemic was related only in part to the pathogenicity of the virus itself, and the cytokine storm that it produced. Important contributors were the context in which the 1918 pandemic occurred, at the end of World War I, with overcrowded barracks, poverty, poor nutrition, poor hygiene, household/community-level crowding, lack of preparation of the population and decision-makers due to cognitive inertia 14 , and poor medical and insufficient nursing care.\n\nThe case fatality rate also depends on the affected population, and is higher in hospitalized patients (4.3%) 15 , in male patients (4.5% compared to 1.3% in female patients), in older patients (5.3% in patients \u2265 60 years compared to 1.4% in those < 60 years), and in patients with cardiovascular, diabetic and chronic respiratory comorbidities 16 . Given the fact that it appears that both the generally accepted R0 and the CFR are most likely overestimated, the impact of the pandemic may be severe, but will not attain the levels predicted in worst-case scenarios.\n\nAt this time, we still have many unanswered questions about this virus. For some of these questions we may not have answers based on hard data for months to come, maybe until the epidemic is over and an analysis of the worldwide data can be performed. However, even before we have all the answers, we should neither panic, nor treat it too lightly. We have to \"keep calm and carry on\" and continue to function as a cytology laboratory dedicated to provide the best service to our patients in this health care emergency, but in the same time maximize the safety of health care workers and prevent unnecessary risks, which could help the dissemination of the virus. pandemic than the MERS outbreaks. The other human coronaviruses, including the two alphacoronaviruses (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63) and two other betacoronaviruses (HCoV-OC43 and HKU1) do not appear to relate to the COVID-19, as these viruses continually circulate worldwide causing mild respiratory infections (\"common cold\") in adults and children.\n\nCoronaviridae got their name from the club-shaped protein spikes on their surface, which give the appearance of a crown or \"corona\" in the two-dimensional image of transmission electron microscopy. They are rather large (120 nm) enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. Their specific tissue tropism, infectivity and species range are conferred by the spike protein, which interacts with a specific cell receptor. In the case of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the receptor for the virus is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on ciliated bronchial epithelial cells, whereas for MERS-CoV, the receptor is DPP4/CD26 on nonciliated respiratory epithelial cells.\n\nThe fact that the receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is ACE2, a protein with a wide species distribution, may explain the observed cross-species transmission 17 , as both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses appear to have originated from animals. They derive most likely from bats, the mammals with the highest diversity of coronaviruses. The transmission may have resulted through the intermediary of civets, the pangolin, or other animals. This is supported by the fact that SARS-CoV-2 has a remarkable 96% genetic homology to a bat coronavirus 18 , and a 99% sequence homology with a coronavirus from the pangolin species 6 . MERS-CoV, probably also originated from bats 17 , but the intermediate hosts are the dromedary camels.\n\nCamel to human transmission of MERS-CoV may occur through contact with camels, unpasteurized camel milk and medicinal use of camel urine 19 , but human to human transmission of the virus also occurs and has been documented in healthcare workers 20 . MERS has a much higher case fatality rate of about 35% for the 2,500 patients with clinical infections 21, 22 . All three diseases (SARS, MERS and COVID-19) have similar, but not identical, clinical manifestations, spanning the entire range from mild flu-like symptoms to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. COVID-19 presents more frequently with lower respiratory system symptoms, including chest tightness, dry cough and dyspnea, and less commonly with gastrointestinal symptoms, like nausea vomiting and diarrhea.\n\nWhile statistics usually include only patients who were tested for the disease because they were symptomatic and presented to their physician or health care facility, the infection is most likely much more prevalent, if one considers asymptomatic or subclinical infections. A recent study showed that 0.2% of healthy adult blood donors in Saudi Arabia have specific antibodies against MERS-CoV, suggesting the existence of a large number of asymptomatic or mild infections, which may act as an unrecognized source of infection 22 . Similar high numbers of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infections have probably occurred during the SARS epidemic.\n\nAlthough the exact incidence of such asymptomatic infection remains unknown, a meta-analysis of SARS data showed overall seroprevalence rates of 0.1% for the general population and 0.23% for health care workers 23 . It is therefore very likely that, when the dust has settled and serologic testing of populations exposed to SARS-CoV-2 is performed, we will realize than asymptomatic or subclinical cases of COVID-19 are much more common than clinical cases and may have played an important role in the spread of the disease.\n\nand has apparently disappeared since 2003, but not before it had spread to 29 countries affecting 8098 people and resulting in 774 fatalities. Compared to SARS, COVID-19 appears to be much more widespread but less deadly. The case-fatality rate (CFR) of SARS was much higher than that of COVID-19, about 10%, compared to 2.3% for COVID-19 16 . The overall transmissibility of SARS was relatively low, with the basic reproductive number (R0) of around 3, i.e. one case would produce three secondary cases of disease in a susceptible community.\n\nHowever, this number was in large part determined by the much higher transmissibility in the hospital setting (R0 = 4). In the community setting, R0 of SARS was much lower, and may have even been less than 1, after the initiation of transmission control measures 24 .\n\nThe most common form of spread of the SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 has been from human to human transmission in settings that frequently involve close and prolonged (15 minutes or more) interaction between infected and uninfected people, facilitating large droplet and contact transmission. After exposure to an infected individual, or less likely a contaminated surface or fomite, the mean incubation period of COVID-19 is about 5 days, but can be much longer, up to 24 days. Nonetheless, 95% of patients who develop clinical disease do so within 12.5 days. The initial presentation is with fever (90-96% of cases 15 ) and mild to severe respiratory symptoms including cough in 70%, dyspnea in 45%, and muscle soreness or fatigue in 40% 15 . 10% of patients or less have sore throat, headaches or diarrhea 25 . Imaging findings are usually those of pneumonia, with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates in 97% of cases 15 Compared to other pneumonias, COVID-19 pneumonia more frequently is more likely to have a peripheral distribution, ground-glass or fine reticular opacities, and is less likely to have a central involvement, pleural effusion or lymphadenopathy 26 . Laboratory findings are nonspecific but usually include leukocytosis with lymphopenia, mildly increased liver enzymes, muscle enzymes, myoglobin, and LDH and increase in acute phase reactants. Increased procalcitonin, severe lymphopenia and elevated D-dimers were features that correlated with more severe disease. In severe cases, the disease may progress to respiratory, circulatory and renal failure, and ultimately death due to multiorgan failure.\n\nA metaanalysis of 50 466 hospitalized patients showed that 18% had severe disease and 15% developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 15 . Among the cases reported to the World Health Organization (WHO), 3% were critical, 15% severe, and 82% were mild 27 . This distribution of cases shows that COVID-19 is on average less severe than the SARS, in which the majority of patients had moderate to severe disease, and 20%-30% required intensive care including mechanical ventilation. In the COVID-19 outbreak in China, the duration of viral shedding ranged from 8 to 37 days. Survivors had a median duration of viral shedding of 20 days, but viral shedding continued until death in fatal cases 28 .\n\nDue to the respiratory tissue and cell tropism seen in early infection, the virus can be isolated from saliva, nasopharynx and lower respiratory tract specimens. However, in advanced or severe cases, viral RNA can be found in the plasma of 15% of patients and may be found in feces, raising the possibility of fecal transmission. Since the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, is also expressed on cardiac myocytes and vascular endothelial cells, the virus could, at least theoretically, directly involve the heart and vascular endothelium. This would explain the fulminant myocarditis that some patients clinically 29, 30 , or show myocardial interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates. However, to date, no studies have been performed on cardiac tissue to determine the presence of the virus. Involvement of endothelial cells may be implicated in the pathogenesis of the severe complications of the disease, including diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n\nBased on the limited evidence available to date, the pathology of COVID-19 is similar to that of SARS and MERS 31, 32 , which, in severe or fatal forms show lung injury in varying stages of exudation and organization 32 . These include acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia, and diffuse alveolar damage, characterized by hyaline membrane formation, interstitial lymphocytic infiltrates, and desquamation of pneumocytes. In lung tissue, in situ hybridization and/or immunohistochemical stains demonstrated the presence of the virus in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells of the trachea (over 50% of ciliated cells), bronchi, and bronchioles, and in pneumocytes, both intact and degenerated, desquamated or forming syncytial giant cells 33 .\n\nThey were also present in the lymphocytes located in the septal infiltrates and within blood vessels. The SARS virus could also be demonstrated in circulating lymphocytes and less frequently in monocytes. At autopsy, the virus was also found in the epithelial cells of the intestinal mucosa and distal renal tubules, and the neurons of the brain 33 . The few reports documenting the findings of COVID-19 show that the pathology is dominated by pulmonary findings, including pulmonary edema and prominent proteinaceous exudates, vascular congestion, and intraalveolar fibrinoid material and various degrees of organization (fibroblastic plugs) corresponding to acute pulmonary injury patterns. In addition, there may be reactive type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, and atypical enlarged pneumocytes with large nuclei, amphophilic granular cytoplasm, and no definite intranuclear or cytoplasmic viral inclusions were identified 36, 37 . The inflammatory infiltrate is predominantly lymphocytic without significant neutrophil participation 38 The abovementioned hospital measures to limit activities that can be safely postponed will undoubtedly affect the cytology laboratory, which will receive fewer specimens. This gives the cytology laboratory an opportunity to re-evaluate their staffing needs and maybe change the workflow. Measures may include working in shifts, and staggered meal breaks, to avoid contact between people, and having only the strictly necessary in the laboratory. A paper from\n\nSingapore advises that laboratory personnel should record their temperature twice a day, to Laboratory measures (see Table 1 )\n\nGiven the extraordinary fast spread of the disease and the pace of change in the information about it and guidelines on how to deal with various aspects of fighting it, one can only give general suggestions for the cytology laboratory's response. The recommendations are similar to those given for general and histopathology laboratories [48] [49] [50] , but also include the situations in which cytology laboratory personnel is involved either in the care of patients potentially infected with SARS-CoV-2 during FNA procedures or rapid-onsite evaluation of aspiration or core biopsies or in the preparation of fresh specimens from such patients.\n\nAlthough the situation is fluid and guidelines can change, making it imperative to keep up to date with high quality information and guidance from web sites like https://www.coronavirus.gov or https://www.nih.gov/coronavirus, as the pandemic unfolds, I believe the some general principles can be applied.\n\nWhile it is important to know which cytology specimens can contain viable and therefore transmissible virus, it is important to emphasize the use of universal standard precautions when dealing with any cytology specimen. From the experience with SARS we can extrapolate that SARS-CoV-2 can be present in fecal and urine samples, in addition to peripheral blood and respiratory samples. SARS-CoV-2 may be present in samples in patients without known COVID-19, in undiagnosed patients, in presymptomatic patients, in patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infections, and in convalescent patients, who may still be shedding the virus. From the available data it is very likely that many, if not most, infections occur through contact with individuals who either don't have the disease or were not diagnosed with COVID-19. In addition, as with most specimens, the clinical diagnosis may not be indicated in the requisition. For all these reasons, all fresh specimens should be considered potentially infectious.\n\n2. Special precautions should be taken handling specimens the preparation of which involves steps that can lead to aerosol formation. All technical procedures should be performed in a way that minimizes the generation of aerosols and droplets. Preparatory steps that may generate aerosols or droplets include expelling aspirates from the needle or syringe, smearing the aspirated material, and potentially air-drying or heat drying the smears, in which pathologists, trainees or cytotechnologists may be involved during rapid on site evaluation (ROSE). Air-drying or heat drying of smears is best performed under Class II Biosafety Cabinets (BSC) 51 . Agitating the smears by hand or using handheld fans to speed up the drying of smears should be avoided. ROSE is an important measure to ensure the adequacy of specimens. However, during an epidemic of a virus with respiratory-transmission, like SARS-CoV-2, clinical judgement should be used to determine if ROSE is absolutely necessary for the success of the biopsy procedure.\n\nIf ROSE is performed, it should be performed with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, laboratory coat/gown and goggles or face shields for eye protection and respiratory protection using a properly fit-tested filter respirator (N-95 or higher level) or a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR). The anticipated shortage of facemasks and filter respirators 52 , makes a very selective use of this procedure important, as it is vital that we reserve this equipment for essential patient encounters and procedures. For similar reasons, it may be safer to suspend the activity of a pathologist-run FNA Clinic for the duration of the pandemic, and consider performing FNAs only on a case-by-case basis, weighing the risks and benefits of the procedure for each patient.\n\nCytopreparatory steps performed by technicians that can lead to aerosol/droplet formation include opening of containers and removing tube caps, blending, vigorous shaking or mixing, vortexing, pipetting, aliquoting, diluting or centrifugation of fluids and discarding the supernatant. All these cytopreparatory steps should be performed in Class II BSC, providing protection for the user, the sample, and the environment. The Table 2 ) Academic institutions should temporarily suspend, limit or move online activities involving over Trainees could also be incorporated into the workflow to preview the WSI. It is obvious that most if not all of us have little experience with online teaching and the use of videoconferencing technologies for teaching pathology. Therefore, during these unprecedented times, we have to constantly seek to improve the delivery of online training by keeping in touch with colleagues using similar technologies and adopting or adapting the strategies that work best. Seeking feedback from trainees is essential, not only to assess the impact of the online teaching, but also to get advice on the use of technologies that the trainees may be more familiar with.\n\nIt is important to address the fact that this epidemic will unavoidably generate stress, fear and anxiety among the entire laboratory personnel, trainees and pathologists 57, 58 . Psychologic stress may be experienced differently by different people, and may be modulated by personal factors like age, sex, health status, baseline anxiety level and risk perception. More severe psychologic distress may be followed by increased levels of posttraumatic stress symptomatology 59 . Psychological distress may be related to increased work load due to coworker absenteeism, lack of socialization with friends and colleagues, lack of recreational activities due to the closure of gyms, restaurants, movie theaters and other recreational avenues, and increased family stress and parenting issues due to children being at home as a result of school closings. It may also relate to having a friend or family member affected by the disease. All healthcare workers may also feel anxious and stressed due to the fear of contracting the disease, fear of transmitting the disease to members of the family, or financial fears related to the changes implemented during this period. During this period, laboratory directors and other pathologists should be prepared to provide up to date information regarding the most recent developments in our knowledge about the disease and candid information regarding all aspects of the personnel's job. Although such information may also be available from a variety of sources, including the CDC and the health care center's website, in order to alleviate the fear and anxiety, it is important to have clear channels of communication, transmit the information in person, and respond to any questions that may arise. Providing emotional support and an opportunity to discuss any personal and family concerns is crucial during these times. It is very important to communicate effectively the risk to laboratory personnel and trainees, without overly reassuring them, and acknowledging that a lot is unknown about this infection. It is equally important to communicate any changes in policy or schedule as soon as possible 60 . If physical meetings are not possible because of the social distancing measures implemented, web-based conferences using a variety of platforms can be used. This can include SMS text messages, e-mails, using both institutional and personal email, if needed, small group discussions, and websites, in addition to online discussion through apps such as Finally, in addition to these measures meant to prevent infection in the workplace, all pathologists, trainees, cytotechnologists and laboratory personnel should also apply commonsense measures to prevent getting infected outside the laboratory environment. This may include, in addition to personal hygiene measures (handwashing, avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth), \"social distancing\", avoiding close contact with other people, and, if possible, avoiding public transportation, avoiding crowds and gatherings of over 10 people, avoiding contact with people who might be sick (i.e. people having fever and respiratory symptoms)."}
