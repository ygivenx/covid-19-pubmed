{"title": "Characterisation of the bovine enteric calici-like virus, Newbury agent 1", "body": "In the last decade, caliciviruses have become recognised as a major cause of non-bacterial gastroenteritis in human adults (reviewed in [1] ). Calici-like viruses have been iden-ti\u00a2ed in association with calf diarrhoea, \u00a2rst in the UK [2, 3] and subsequently in Germany [4^6] . Unlike the human viruses, they have not been well characterised, in part due to the lack of a cell culture system and the apparently low numbers of particles in faeces. Two of the three reported bovine viruses, one from the UK (Newbury agent 2, NA2) [7] and one from Germany (Jena virus) [8] , were shown recently to be members of the family Caliciviridae.\n\nIn the present paper, we characterise the second bovine enteric calici-like virus, Newbury agent 1 (NA1), identi\u00a2ed in the UK to examine the hypothesis that NA1 is also a member of the family Caliciviridae and to explore its relationship to NA2.\n\nThe bovine viruses, Newbury agent 1 (NA1) and Newbury agent 2 (NA2) originated from two herds in the UK with a history of calf diarrhoea and were initially described as Newbury agent SRV-1 and SRV-2 [2, 9] . The original faecal samples also contained astroviruses, rotaviruses or coronaviruses which were removed as described previously. Pre-and post-inoculation NA1 antisera were raised in a 50 days old gnotobiotic calf (P143) inoculated orally with 3 ml of a faecal \u00a2ltrate of NA1 prepared by passage of a 25% faecal emulsion in PBSK through a 0.45 Wm membrane \u00a2lter. The calf developed diarrhoea and recovered. Calici-like virus particles were identi\u00a2ed in faecal samples by electron microscopy but no other viruses were seen. Ten weeks later, a similar faecal \u00a2ltrate was inoculated intravenously and the calf was bled out 5 days later to provide antiserum. The antiserum was free of antibodies to bovine astrovirus, the UK strain of bovine rotavirus, bovine enteric coronavirus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus, feline calicivirus and the Haden strain of bovine parvovirus (J.C. Bridger, personal observations).\n\nAn NA1 immunoglobulin concentrate was kindly prepared from the calf antiserum by Dave Harkins, The Moredun Research Institute, Edinburgh using a protein A Sepharose fast \u00a3ow column (Pharmacia Biotech). The NA2 immunoglobulin concentrate was described previously [7] .\n\nFeline calicivirus (FCV, NADC strain) and hyperimmune rabbit anti-FCV NADC serum with a neutralising titre of 1:40 000 was provided by Dr. John Neill from the National Animal Disease Centre (NADC), IA, USA. It was grown in the crandel reese feline kidney (CRFK) cell line supplied by Ruth Ryvar, Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Liverpool. Recombinant Lordsdale virus capsid antigen and rabbit antiserum were kindly provided by Dr. Ian Clarke, Molecular Microbiology Group, University Medical School, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, UK. The concentration was estimated to be 5^10 Wg Wl 31 (Dr. Ian Clarke, personal communication).\n\nFaecal samples were obtained from three gnotobiotic calves (1424, 2042, 2010) inoculated with NA1 [9] . Gnotobiotic calves 1424 (41 days old) and 2042 (45 days old) were given 3 ml of the same faecal emulsion by mouth. Faecal samples from calf 1424 were used to inoculate calf 2010 (49 days old). Faecal samples were collected before inoculation and daily afterwards for 5 days.\n\nSPIEM was conducted with 25% faecal suspensions or puri\u00a2ed virus preparations as described previously using a 1:20 (NA1) or 1:40 dilution (NA2) of the immunoglobulin concentrate [7] . A uniform and well-stained area of the grid was selected at 150U magni\u00a2cation and particles counted at 50 000U instrumental magni\u00a2cation. For each grid square, virus particles were counted in \u00a2ve \u00a2elds and a total of three or \u00a2ve grid squares were counted for each test sample. A positive control sample was included in each assay to ensure reproducibility.\n\nNA1 particles, trapped onto electron microscope grids by SPIEM, were negatively stained with a mixture of equal volumes of 4% PTA pH 6.0 and catalase crystals (Boehringer Mannheim Corp.) which were used as an internal measurement standard. The diameters of 20 particles were measured on negative exposures by calculating the mean value from two measurements taken at right angles to each other. The distance between 10 consecutive lattice spacings (taken as 87.5 A \u00ee ) of catalase crystals in the same electron microscope \u00a2eld was used as an internal measurement standard.\n\nA clari\u00a2ed freon-extracted day 2 faecal sample from calf 1424 was diluted to 10 ml, centrifuged at 83 000Ug for 2 h at 4\u00b3C, the pellet resuspended in 200^300 Wl volumes of PBSK and layered on top of a 35% (w/w) CsCl solution. After centrifugation to equilibrium at 155 000Ug for 17 h at 4\u00b3C, 0.5 ml fractions were collected by gravity using a top unloading method. A 15^20 Wl volume of each fraction was monitored for refractive index at 25\u00b3C. Fractions were examined by SPIEM as described previously but grids were washed with 10 consecutive 150 Wl volumes of MilliQ water to remove CsCl. Buoyant densities were calculated from refractive indices corrected for the refractive index of PBSK. Buoyant densities were also determined by weighing. The weight of 3^6 100 Wl volumes of each fraction, taken by a calibrated Gilson pipette, was measured to 4 decimal points at 25\u00b3C and the average was calculated for each fraction. The accuracy of the procedure was validated by measuring the density of MilliQ water at the same temperature and taking the density at 25\u00b3C as 0.99707 g ml 31 .\n\nTwo or three fractions from CsCl density gradients around the NA1 buoyant density of 1.34 g cm 33 and containing the highest numbers of particles, were pooled and ultracentrifuged at 83 000Ug for 2 h. The resultant invisible pellet was resuspended in a 100^150 Wl volume of MilliQ water and 15^60 Wl volumes were used in Western blotting. With the day 0 faecal sample, an ultracentrifuge pellet was made of two^three pooled CsCl fractions around a buoyant density of 1.34 g cm 33 . The FCV antigen was prepared by freon extraction and ultracentrifugation using a 10 ml volume of infected cell culture \u00a3uid. The same procedure was applied to uninfected \u00a3asks. The resultant pellet was resuspended in 100 Wl of MilliQ water and a 3 Wl volume used in Western blotting. A 0.1 Wl volume of the Lordsdale recombinant capsid protein was used. Preparations were mixed with an appropriate volume of sample loading bu\u00a1er (5% SDS, 10% glycerol from BDH, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mM Tris^HCl pH 6.8 and 0.1% bromophenol blue) boiled for 4 min and loaded onto Laemmli discontinuous bu\u00a1er gels with 10% resolving and 5% stacking gels. One Wg of bovine immunoglobulin in MilliQ water and Kaleidoscope pre-stained standard marker proteins (Bio-Rad or Sigma Chemical Co.) were used as controls for the electroblotting and immunostaining steps. A mixture of biotinylated protein markers (from 200 to 6.5 kDa; Bio-Rad) was co-run with the disrupted virus proteins for accurate molecular mass determinations. Three percent gelatin was used to block non-speci\u00a2c binding sites and virus-speci\u00a2c antibodies and immunoglobulin conjugates were diluted in 2% gelatin. Virus-speci\u00a2c antibody reactions were performed overnight; immunoglobulin conjugate reactions were performed for 0.5^1 h. The dilutions of antisera and conjugates used were 1:2000 and 1:5000 of the NA1 pre-and post-inoculation bovine antisera, 1:10 000 of the rabbit FCV antiserum and rabbit Lordsdale recombinant capsid protein antiserum, 1:5000 for the rabbit anti-bovine IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma Chemical Co.), 1:3000 for the goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma Chemical Co.) and avidin alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Bio-Rad) used to detect the biotinylated standards. Substrates were Ready-to-use Western blue1 (Promega) or BCIP (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate)/NBT (nitro blue tetrazolium) (Promega).\n\nAdequate levels of virus for further study were identi\u00a2ed by SPIEM in one faecal sample from one (calf no. 1424) of three experimentally inoculated gnotobiotic calves (Fig.  1) . Virus was \u00a2rst detected on the second day after inoculation in two calves (calf nos. 1424 and 2010) as clinical signs commenced. Particles were excreted for at least 2 or 3 more days but numbers were low. Particles were not observed in pre-inoculation samples. Only occasional particles were detected in the faecal samples of the third calf, no. 2042, but a day 2 sample was not available. The SPIEM technique allowed accurate quanti\u00a2cation of NA1 virions (Fig. 1) . Variation in the mean number of particles trapped per \u00a2eld on duplicate grids was small, ranging from 1-to 2.5-fold in four independent experiments. There was little non-speci\u00a2c attachment to negative control grids coated with rotavirus antiserum. Use of immunoglobulin concentrates was essential in SPIEM, in contrast to Western blotting, as 1:10 to 1:160 dilutions of antiserum failed to trap particles above background levels.\n\nTwo of the three calves developed multiple clinical \n\nIn faecal suspensions and puri\u00a2ed preparations, NA1 virions appeared as small round viruses with inde\u00a2nite surface morphology and ragged outer edges (Fig. 2) . Some particles displayed projections on their outer edges almost giving a 10-spiked appearance. Their morphology was indistinguishable from particles prepared by direct electron microscopy [9] but clearly di\u00a1ered from the feline calicivirus NADC strain, which showed classical calicivirus morphology (not shown). The average particle diameter was 36.6 \u00fe 1.7 nm determined using an internal calibration standard. A mean CsCl buoyant density of 1.34 \u00fe 0.0044 g cm 33 was obtained at 25\u00b3C in eight independent experiments by measuring refractive indices (Fig.  3 ) and in one experiment by weighing fractions.\n\nWestern blotting analysis of NA1 virions puri\u00a2ed from faeces by CsCl density gradient centrifugation demonstrated the presence of a single protein band in each of \u00a2ve separate preparations from the day 2 p.i. faecal sample from calf 1424 (Fig. 4a, track 2) . The speci\u00a2city of the protein band was con\u00a2rmed by examination of day 0 versus day 2 p.i. faecal samples, staining with pre-and postinoculation antisera and association with the presence of virus particles in CsCl gradients. No signal was seen with the day 0 faecal sample which did not contain virus particles but which was puri\u00a2ed in the same way as the day 2 p.i. faecal sample (Fig. 4a, track 1) . A comparable band was absent in the day 2 puri\u00a2ed fractions when probed with the pre-inoculation NA1 serum (Fig. 4b, track 2) . In CsCl density gradients, the protein band was observed only in the CsCl fraction with the peak number of virus particles and not in fractions with no or low numbers (not shown).\n\nIn \u00a2ve independent experiments, the single NA1 band migrated faster than the heavy chain of bovine immunoglobulin indicating a lower molecular mass than expected compared to the capsid molecular masses of known caliciviruses. Molecular masses of 49.8 and 49.0 kDa (mean 49.4 kDa; r = 30.99) were obtained by co-electrophoresis with biotinylated molecular mass standards (Fig. 5a) . The accuracy of the method was assessed with the established caliciviruses, FCV and Lordsdale virus and found to give the molecular masses expected for these viruses. The FCV capsid protein, with a reported molecular mass of 66 kDa [10] , was determined as 64.2 and 65.1 kDa by co-electrophoresis in two independent experiments (mean 64.65 kDa) (Fig. 5b) . Co-electrophoresis of disrupted recombinant Lordsdale particles (rLVPs) with the biotinylated molecular mass markers revealed the presence of the expected 58 kDa protein (not shown) [11] .\n\nReciprocal cross-reactions by SPIEM demonstrated a complete lack of an antigenic relationship between NA1 and the bovine calicivirus NA2. Less than one particle was seen per \u00a2eld (0.0 to 0.4 \u00fe 0.7) with 1:10, 1:20 and 1:40 dilutions of the NA1 and NA2 heterologous immunoglobulin concentrates which trapped an average of 50.4 \u00fe 11.9 to 79.6 \u00fe 20.2 homologous particles per \u00a2eld in every ex-periment (means are given from two experiments but the lack of heterologous reactions was observed in over four experiments).\n\nPost-inoculation NA2 antisera failed to react with the 49.4 kDa capsid protein of NA1 by Western blotting. However, it was not possible to test the homologous reactivity of the NA2 antiserum in Western blotting as attempts to concentrate and purify NA2 particles in su\u00a4cient numbers failed.\n\nThe bovine enteric calici-like virus NA1 had properties consistent with classi\u00a2cation within the Caliciviridae. The particle diameter of 36.6 nm and CsCl buoyant density of 1.34 g cm 33 were within the ranges for established caliciviruses, including the human SRSVs [12, 13] . In puri\u00a2ed preparations, NA1 morphology was con\u00a2rmed as being similar to human SRSVs. Puri\u00a2ed NA1 virions contained a single capsid protein, a property characteristic of caliciviruses. However, antigenic diversity between bovine enteric caliciviruses was demonstrated in vitro for the \u00a2rst time by the complete lack of cross-reactivity by SPIEM between NA1 and the established bovine enteric calicivirus NA2. This supported earlier experiments in vivo where the two viruses failed to cross-protect [9] . Considerable antigenic diversity is well established amongst human enteric caliciviruses (SRSVs) [14^16] . Further studies will be needed to establish the extent of antigenic diversity amongst bovine enteric caliciviruses and their relationship to the equivalent human viruses. The capsid molecular mass of 49.4 kDa, was lower than expected from the 57^63 kDa range reported for human enteric caliciviruses with SRSV morphology [12,13,17^20] . It was also lower than the 55 kDa molecular mass of the in vitro translated capsid protein of the Jena virus, the only other bovine enteric calicivirus with a known capsid molecular mass [8] . Considerable care was taken to determine the molecular mass of the NA1 capsid protein by electrophoresis of the capsid protein with molecular mass standard proteins. Capsid proteins with molecular masses less than 55 kDa have been associated with some calicivirus capsids but, in most instances, a higher molecular mass protein has been apparent [21^23]. There was no evidence that the NA1 49.4 kDa band represented a degradation product of the capsid protein. A higher molecular mass band was never seen in the NA1 preparations and the CsCl preparations used contained intact virus particles with typical SRSV size and morphology. Con\u00a2rmation of the low NA1 capsid molecular mass will have to await elucidation of the deduced amino acid sequence of the NA1 capsid protein from genomic analysis and recombinant capsid expression studies. However, it has not been possible to amplify the NA1 genome from faecal suspensions or puri\u00a2ed preparations using a range of PCR primers used successfully with NA2, further supporting the notion that bovine enteric caliciviruses are diverse.\n\nSPIEM greatly improved detection of NA1 from faecal samples. Earlier studies used direct electron microscopy but only low numbers of particles were identi\u00a2ed making it impossible to identify samples with adequate numbers of virions for further study [2, 9] . The present study showed that virions are not di\u00a4cult to detect if early samples are examined by SPIEM. SPIEM enabled NA1 to be detected in the absence of a cell culture infectivity assay or knowledge about its genomic composition and, thus, allowed us to characterise the virus. The short period of virus shedding seen in the experimental calves by SPIEM was similar to that found in experimental infections with the previously described bovine enteric calicivirus NA2 [7] and the human Norwalk virus [24, 25] but contrasts markedly with bovine rotaviruses, another enteric pathogen, which are excreted at high levels for 4^6 days. The short virus excretion period and the lack of a broadly reactive and sensitive detection method may explain why so few investigators have reported the involvement of caliciviruses in outbreaks of calf diarrhoea. Enteropathogens were not detected in 31% of diarrhoeic faecal samples in a study of the microbiology of calf diarrhoea in the UK [3] . Failure to detect caliciviruses may be the reason for the lack of a diagnosis and further studies are warranted."}
