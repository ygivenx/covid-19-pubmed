{"title": "Multifunctional biophotonic nanostructures inspired by longtail glasswing butterfly for medical devices", "body": "The C. faunus butterfly (Fig. 1a) belongs to the Riodinidae family found in South America. We have discovered that the C. faunus wings are distinct from most other transparent wings in nature9,11,22. They have a rare combination of two transparent regions that transmit light differently: (1) the basal transparent areas close to thorax (indicated by a blue arrow in Fig. 1a); and (2) the postdiscal transparent areas further away from the thorax (indicated by a red arrow in Fig. 1a) of both the forewing and hindwing. High-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the postdiscal transparent area (Fig. 1c) reveals dome-shaped nanopillars with moderate aspect-ratios (1.090 \u00b1 0.041; Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. S1), compared to other natural transparent wings with higher aspect-ratios (>1)10\u201312. Interestingly, the basal transparent area is composed of similarly shaped nanostructures at a lower density (Fig. 1d). The two-dimensional fast Fourier transforms of the SEM images showed ring-shaped distributions (insets of Fig. 1c and 1d), which confirmed their short-range-ordered arrangements11,23. The finite diameters of the rings in k-space quantified the average periods of the nanostructures as 140\u2013180 nm and 200\u2013300 nm for the postdiscal and basal areas, respectively.\n\nThe zone-dependent variation in average inter-structural periods on the C. faunus wing plays an important role in the extent of light scattering on the wing. The postdiscal area with an average period below 200 nm remains scattering-free and anti-reflective in the ultraviolet (UV)-visible (VIS)-near-infrared (NIR) regime, and this is well-explained by the effective medium theory and the transfer-matrix model as in other anti-reflective subwavelength nanostructures found in nature11,24 (Supplementary Fig. S2). The basal area with an average period exceeding 200 nm comparable to light wavelengths shows forward narrow-angle scattering due to more sparsely-located, moderate-aspect-ratio low-index nanostructures25,26. Our finite-difference time-domain simulations performed on both groups of nanostructures for 420-nm wavelength produced matching results that confirmed the scattering mechanism of the basal area (Fig. 1e\u2013f). Although we used the same structural height and diameter for both groups in the simulations, the nanostructures with a 150-nm period (similar to the postdiscal area) did not alter the transmitted field (Fig. 1e), whereas nanostructures with a 300-nm period (similar to the basal area) showed forward scattering of the transmitted light (Fig. 1f). The scattering phenomenon of the basal region is moreover confirmed by the difference observed between the specular transmittance and total transmittance in the VIS-NIR range shown in Fig. 1h.\n\nTo further analyse the transmissive scattering properties of both areas, we have performed the angle-resolved scattering spectroscopy in the VIS range and varied both the incident and detection angles (Fig. 1i\u2013j). Having almost identical specular and diffuse transmissions in the VIS-NIR range (Fig. 1g), the postdiscal area exhibited specular transmittance with a low scattering angle of \u00b13\u00b0 (Fig. 1i). On the other hand, the basal area scattered light in the forward direction with scattering angles up to \u00b112\u00b0 and showed negligible changes with incident angle variation, demonstrating its potentially very useful angle-independent scattering property (Fig. 1j). This scattering property could ameliorate the difficulty of detecting optical signals at wide angles, a commonly observed challenge among many light-based devices14 such as implantable IOP sensors15 (See Supplementary Section SI1 and Fig. S3\u2013S4 for more details on the biological significance of the multifunctional transparency and its dual nano-structural basis present on C. faunus wings.)\n\nAdditionally, the periods of the nanostructures on C. faunus wings also influence the wetting properties, and the static contact angles in the postdiscal and basal areas measured 105\u00b0 and 85\u00b0, respectively. The contact angle in the postdiscal area is larger due to the higher surface roughness27. In our experiments, these nanostructures with moderate aspect-ratios, similar to nanostructures with high aspect-ratios, resist microbial and cellular growth (Supplementary Fig. S5\u2013S6).\n\nInspired by the nanostructures on the basal area of the C. faunus wings, we implemented short-range-ordered nanostructures on Si3N4-membranes (Fig. 2a) by utilizing a highly scalable bottom-up fabrication process based on polymer-phase separation28,29. Si3N4 was chosen for its ease of fabrication on Si and proven performance as an optically transparent and mechanically robust freestanding membrane in microdevices30,31 as well as for its intrinsic hydrophilicity that is crucial to the antifouling property of the nanostructures as discussed in more detail later in this work.\n\nWe created disk-shaped nanostructures with aspect-ratios ranging from 0.15 to 0.90 and performed parametric studies to determine optical and anti-biofouling properties (Supplementary Fig. S7). Nanostructures with an aspect-ratio of 0.45 (Fig. 2b), which was smaller than the aspect-ratio of \u22481 observed in the nanostructures found on the C. faunus wings, were found to provide an optimal balance between the anti-biofouling and angle-independent optical properties best-suited for optical implants (see Supplementary Section SI2). Henceforth, the aspect-ratio of nanostructures integrated on the membrane is 0.45 unless stated otherwise.\n\nThe SEM image of the nanostructured Si3N4-membrane is shown in Fig. 2c. The 2D-fast Fourier transform of the SEM image shown in the inset indicates a short-range order with a mean period of 445 \u00b1 60 nm, similar to the periodicity of the basal area. The contact angle on the surface of the nanostructured Si3N4-membrane was 17\u00b0, suggesting an increase in hydrophilicity compared to 38\u00b0 measured on flat Si3N4 without nanostructures (Supplementary Fig. S8).\n\nWe characterised the optical properties of the nanostructured Si3N4-membrane using angle-resolved transmission spectroscopy in the VIS-NIR range and compared the results to a flat Si3N4-membrane without nanostructures (Fig. 2d and e). Using the nanostructures, the angle independence of the Si3N4-membrane transmission was improved by 50%. 3D simulation of the fabricated structures (Supplementary Fig. S9b) further confirms the improved angle-independent transmittance. This angle-independent transmission results from the isotropic nature of the forward scattering caused by the short-range-ordered nanostructures, which is irrespective of the incident angle (Fig. 1j). As the total transmission is the combination of ballistic (specular) transmission through the thin membrane and scattered transmission caused by the nanostructures (Supplementary Fig. S10)32, the angle-independent property of the scattered component decreases the overall angle dependence of the total transmission.\n\nIn vitro testing compared the adhesion of representative proteins, prokaryotes, and eukaryotes on nanostructured and flat Si3N4 surfaces with lysine-coated glass slides as positive controls. Flat Si3N4 is moderately hydrophilic (contact angle: 35\u201340\u00b0) and known to vigorously promote cell adhesion and proliferation due to increased adsorption of proteins when compared to more hydrophilic surfaces (contact angle: <20\u00b0)33,34. Hence, we further increased the hydrophilicity of the Si3N4 surface by varying the aspect-ratios of the nanostructures from 0.15 to 0.90 and systematically controlled surface hydrophilicity (Supplementary Fig. S8). Once strong hydrophilicity is achieved (contact angle: <20\u00b0), a nanostructure-mediated aqueous barrier forms on the surface and limits protein adsorption and cell adhesion to provide an anti-adhesion property (Supplementary Section SI3, Supplementary Fig. S11 and S16)6,35,36.\n\nWe initially investigated the surface adhesion of two representative proteins: (1) fluorescent-labelled bovine serum albumin for its cardinal role in blood\u2013material interactions4 and high non-specific binding affinity to the surfaces of biomaterials37; and (2) streptavidin for its specific binding affinity to Si3N4 surfaces38. Fluorescence-intensity-based quantification of the adhesion force (Fig. 3a, 4b, and Supplementary Fig. S11) demonstrated adhesion on flat Si3N4 surfaces was three and two times greater compared with nanostructured Si3N4 surfaces for albumin and streptavidin, respectively.\n\nWe then quantified bacterial adhesion using E. coli transformed with the green fluorescent protein (Supplementary Fig. S12). In addition to being a popular prokaryotic model, E. coli was chosen for its pathogenic potential to cause gram-negative and often antibiotic-resistant infections on and around implants39,40. Bacteria on each surface were quantified through a measure of colony-forming units (CFU) (Fig. 3c) and fluorescence-intensity measurements (Supplementary Fig. S13). Both results indicated significantly lower bacterial adhesion on the nanostructured surface compared to flat Si3N4. Additionally, the SEM image of individual bacterial cells on the nanostructured surface shows no disruption to their shape, indicating no physical lysis (Supplementary Fig. S14).\n\nThe HeLa cell line was chosen as a representative eukaryote for its proven robustness, aggressive growth rate, and adherent nature that prompts its frequent usage in adhesion and cytotoxicity assays41,42. After 72 hours, the adherent cell density on the flat Si3N4 was eight times greater than that on the nanostructured Si3N4 surface (Fig. 3d & 4e). Next, a mortality ratio, the number of dead cells to the number of living cells, was computed for each surface every 24 hours over a 72-hour period. The difference in the mortality ratios of the two surfaces after 72 hours was not statistically significant (Supplementary Fig. S15), which suggested the nanostructured surfaces inhibited eukaryote adhesion and proliferation without inducing cell death.\n\nThese results highlight the advantage of the anti-biofouling approach based on strong hydrophilicity and anti-adhesion properties (Supplementary Fig. S11\u2013S16). High or moderate aspect-ratio nanostructures either with tapered sharp tips or dome-shaped tips as in C. faunus display potent geometry-dependent bactericidal properties that induce large stresses and deformation on cell walls regardless of their surface chemical composition43 and actively promote autogenous lysis when placed in contact with mammalian cells44. Such anti-biofouling approaches relying on physical lysis could undesirably damage tissues surrounding implants and elicit inflammation. Supplementary Table S1 shows physical lysis occurs on either natural or synthetic nanostructured surfaces if the aspect-ratio of the nanostructures is 1 or greater. Hence, by keeping the aspect-ratio of the nanostructures at 0.45, the anti-adhesion property was leveraged to prevent biofouling without causing any physical lysis. Additionally, the hydrophilicity of the nanostructured surface originates from surface topology, which may provide better long-term reliability over chemical-treatment methods. (See Supplementary Section SI3 and Fig. S17.)\n\nTo demonstrate a medical application of multifunctional nanostructures, we used the nanostructured Si3N4-membrane as an opto-mechanical sensing element in a microscale implantable IOP sensor, which is a hermetically-sealed, pressure-sensitive, Fabry-Perot (FP) resonator15. A flat-surfaced or nanostructured flexible Si3N4-membrane forms the top surface of the FP-resonator while a mirror-like rigid Si forms the bottom surface. The sensor is optimised in the NIR range for minimum absorption in tissue and water. If the ambient pressure or IOP changes, the membrane will deflect accordingly, and the resulting shift in the resonance wavelength will be captured remotely in reflection (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. S19). In in vivo testing, FP-based IOP sensors suffer from narrow readout angles that severely limits sensor practical usability (Supplementary Fig. S20) and biofouling that shortens sensor lifespan15.\n\nTo study the dependence on readout angle \u03b8, we compared the measurements from a nanostructured and a flat-surfaced IOP sensor at 1 atm (Fig. 4b\u2013d). The flat-surfaced sensor produced a maximum resonance shift of 16 nm at incident angle of 12\u00b0 (Fig. 4b). In contrast, the nanostructured sensor produced shifts of 2 nm at 12\u00b0 and 5 nm at 30\u00b0. Decay in the intensity of reflected resonance was also measured as a function of the incident angle (Fig. 4c). For the flat-surfaced sensor, the intensity decayed to zero when the incident angle reached 12\u00b0 while the signal from the nanostructured sensor remained detectable until 30\u00b0. The IOP-measurement error of the flat-surfaced sensor reached 4.59 mmHg at 12\u00b0 (Fig. 4d), which is approximately 46% of the physiological IOP range observed in humans (10\u201320 mmHg) and exceeds the \u00b11.2 mmHg error range of existing clinical tonometers45,46. On the other hand, the IOP-measurement error of the nanostructured sensor was 0.07 and 0.92 mmHg at 12\u00b0 and 28\u00b0, respectively. These results highlight the wide-angle performance of the nanostructured sensor. The nanostructured sensor showed excellent linearity (correlation factor: ~1.00) over the clinical range of interest range from 0 to 30 mmHg when tested in a pressure-controlled chamber interfaced with a digital pressure gauge (Fig. 4e). The maximum readout error was 0.26 mmHg, approximately four times lower than that of the flat-surfaced sensor (1 mmHg).\n\nA nanostructured and a flat-surfaced sensor were implanted individually inside the anterior chambers of two New Zealand white rabbits to investigate in vivo optical performance and biocompatibility (Fig. 5a). To examine the stability of sensor measurements, the shift \u0394\u03bb of the most prominent peak in each spectrum of the set was computed with respect to the mean of the set (Fig. 5b). The standard deviation (s. d.) of \u0394\u03bb of the nanostructured sensor was 0.6 nm as opposed to 1.3 nm observed for the flat-surfaced sensor (Fig. 5c). Additionally, the s. d. of IOP measurements produced using the nanostructured sensor was 0.23 mmHg as opposed to 0.64 and 1.97 mmHg calculated from measurements concurrently obtained using the flat-surfaced sensor and tonometry, respectively (Fig. 5d). The angle independence enhanced by the nanostructure integration improved the stability and accuracy of the optical measurements against potential error sources such as respiratory movements, subtle eye motions, and detector misalignment. Furthermore, indirect IOP measurement techniques such as tonometry are influenced by various factors such as corneal thickness, curvature and biomechanics and are in general more error-prone compared to direct IOP measurement techniques such as implantable sensors15,47.\n\nBoth sensors were retrieved after one month of implantation to quantify cell growth on surface and to assess biocompatibility. We used confocal fluorescence microscopy to determine the extent of tissue growth and cellular viability at the time of retrieval. DAPI was used to localize all constituent cells while Phalloidin, which selectively binds to actin, was used as an indicator of cellular processes and health48. Additionally, matrix metalloproteinases-2 (MMP-2) was used as an indicator of inflammation for its role in various inflammatory and repair processes49.\n\nFig. 5e and 5f show the top views of the z-stacked multi-channel immunofluorescence images of the flat-surfaced and the nanostructured sensors, respectively. Approximately 59% of the flat-surfaced sensor was covered by tissue, and the presence of a vast filamentous F-actin network (Fig. 5e, in green) indicates healthy tissue growth at the time of extraction. Additionally, MMP-2 (Fig. 5e, in red) was observed over the membrane of the flat-surfaced sensor, which could have triggered the extensive cell migration towards this region. In comparison, approximately 5% of the nanostructured surface was covered by tissue, which was a 12-fold improvement over the flat-surfaced sensor, and there was no detectable MMP-2 signal, suggesting the cell signalling and migration patterns present on the flat-surfaced sensor were absent on the nanostructured sensor. This indicates no inflammation occurred post-implantation and highlights the promising role of the nanostructures towards significantly improving in vivo biocompatibility of medical implants.\n\nInspired by the short-range-ordered nanostructures found on the wings of the transparent longtail glasswing C. faunus butterfly, we engineered the biophotonic nanostructures optimised for use in medical implants. By tuning the key physical dimensions of the nanostructures, we have engineered structurally-induced scattering that expands an optical readout angle and improved antifouling with supressed inflammation suitable for IOP-sensing implants. In Glaucoma, accurate IOP monitoring is the only mainstay of disease diagnosis and management47, and optical sensing approaches for IOP monitoring have been promising in terms of miniaturization, energy efficiency and frequency of monitoring15; however they also require improvement in readout angle and biocompatibility for practical use. The integration of the nanostructures on an IOP-sensing implant significantly expanded its detection range while reducing mean in vivo IOP error by 3-folds. Further, the nanostructures effectively suppressed biofouling and inflammation by 12-folds, resulting in a highly practical implant for long-term IOP monitoring. Further development of our bio-inspired work, including continuous IOP monitoring using mobile devices with an integration of features such as memory-based tracking50, will improve glaucoma treatment outcomes and lower the risk of visual impairment and blindness. With these promising results, we envisage numerous medical technologies and devices will benefit greatly from the multifunctionality of biophotonic nanostructures.\n\nDried wings of C. faunus, bought from Bicbugs LLC were coated with a 15 nm gold layer (Lesker Labline E-beam Evaporator, Kurt J. Lesker Company\u00ae, USA) before examination by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (FEI Nova 200 NanoLab Dualbeam, USA) operated at 5 kV.\n\nImageJ (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/), a public domain and Java-based image processing program tool, was used to perform the statistical analysis of the nanostructure size on the wing membrane and fabricated nanostructured Si3N4 samples. Every pixel in the images was turned into either black or white using a threshold value that was obtained by calculating the mean intensity value of all the pixels of the same image. Subsequently, the diameters and areas of the nanostructures were computed. The 2-D Fourier power spectra were obtained from SEM images and calculated with a fast Fourier transform algorithm in MATLAB.\n\nThe thin film simulations of flat Si3N4-membrane and the postdiscal area were calculated analytically using MATLAB11. The developed multilayer thin-film calculator is based on matching the boundary conditions for Maxwell\u2019s equations. Calculations were first done for individual polarizations and by taking the average afterwards to consider the unpolarized light ((TE+TM)/2) condition.\n\nThe optical properties of the basal area nanostructures were numerically simulated with the 2D finite-difference time-domain software (Lumerical Solutions Inc.\u00ae, Canada). The transmittance of nanostructured membrane were numerically simulated with the 3D finite element method (FEM) (COMSOL Multiphysics\u00ae, USA). In order to simulate exact optical properties of the fabricated nanostructured samples, the measured 3D patterning profile was directly imported from SEM in the simulated model. Periodic boundary conditions in the lateral directions (x and y) were applied for the calculations. An incoming plane wave impinging the structures under normal and oblique incidence was used and all calculations were performed with a spatial resolution of 5 nm. In the simulation process, the boundary conditions of the electromagnetic fields in the vertical (z) direction were set on the perfect matching layer (PML) for the model. The total transmittance was calculated for individual geometries for unpolarised light ((TE + TM)/2) at normal and oblique incident angles by integrating the near-zone scattered power (Poynting vector) over a surface before the bottom PML and afterward normalizing with incident intensity.\n\nSpecular transmission and scattering spectra of the C. faunus wings were measured using a custom-built optical goniometric setup. A stabilized Tungsten-Halogen light source (SLS201, ThorLabs, USA) was collimated to form a 500 \u00b5m wide parallel incident beam that illuminates the sample at a fixed angle. The specular transmission and forward scattered light was detected at fixed and different angles, respectively, with an angular resolution of 2\u00b0 and coupled into an optical fibre connected to the spectrometer (Flame, Ocean Optics, USA). All measurements were recorded with an unpolarized light.\n\nThe diffuse transmittance measurements were performed using a commercial Cary 5000 Vis/NIR with integrating sphere. All measurements were recorded with unpolarised light. The samples were placed in the middle of the integrating sphere using a vice-type centre-mount and the sample holder was rotated around the vertical axis for angle-resolved measurements. Transmission measurements were normalised to that of the uncovered area of the underlying glass slide.\n\nPoly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA, Mw = 9590, Polymer Standards Service GmbH, Germany) and polystyrene (PS, Mw = 19100, Polymer Standards Service GmbH, Germany) were dissolved in methyl ethyl ketone (MEK, Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC, USA) with a mass ratio of 65% and 35%. The concentration of the solutions was kept fixed to 25 mg/ml. Solutions were spin-coated on the substrates with a speed of 3500 rpm and acceleration of 2000 rpm/s for 30 seconds. Relative humidity was maintained between 40% and 50% during the spin coating. The de-mixing of the blend components out of the smooth surface occurred during spin coating itself due to the difference in relative solubility of PS and PMMA in MEK. Schematics of this complete 3D lateral phase separation process in humid condition28. When the sample begins to spin, water condensation begins at humidity levels above 35%. A layer of water-rich solution is formed at the air solution interface due to the difference in evaporation rate between water and MEK. Water starts to condense from the air into the solution because of the evaporation of MEK, which decreases the temperature on top below the dew point. Because of the high water concentration, a 3-dimensional phase separation occurs between PS/MEK and PMMA/MEK/water. When the film is completely dried, a purely lateral morphology is formed and the PS islands end with an ellipsoidal shape. The samples were then rinsed in cyclohexane for 2 minutes and dried in a stream of N2 to remove the PS islands. Using the PMMA layer as a template, a 30 nm Al2O3 hard masking layer was deposited via e-beam evaporation (CHA Industries Mark 40). After lift-off, the Si3N4 was textured through RIE (Oxford PlasmaLab 100 ICP380) resulting in the nanostructured surface.\n\nThe fabrication process flow of the nanostructured membrane and IOP sensor is provided in Fig. S18. The sensor consists of two parts (top and bottom) that were individually batch-fabricated and bonded together using a medical grade epoxy to produce a hermetically sealed miniaturized Fabry-Perot (FP) cavity. (T1) The top substrate fabrication begins with 2 \u00b5m-thick SiO2 and 400 nm thick Si3N4 layers deposited on the top and bottom surfaces of a double-side-polished (DSP) Si wafer (thickness: 300 \u00b5m) using thermal oxidation and low pressure chemical vapour deposition (LPCVD), respectively. (T2) The Si3N4 and SiO2 layers on the top surface of the wafer were completely removed using reactive ion etching (RIE) (Plasmalab System 100 RIE/ICP, Oxford Instruments, Inc.) and buffered oxide etch (BOE). Next, a 300 nm-thick Al oxide (Al2O3) layer was deposited using an e-beam evaporator (FC-1800 E-Beam Evaporator, Temescal) and patterned the surface using photolithography and BOE. (T3) Using the patterned Al2O3 layer as a hard mask, the wafer was etched using a Bosch process (Plasmalab System 100 RIE/ICP, Oxford Instruments, Inc.) down to the SiO2 etch stop at the bottom surface of the wafer. (T4) The SiO2 layer was removed through BOE to create freestanding Si3N4-membranes. The nanostructuring process described in the previous section was used to structure the Si3N4-membrane. (T5) Individual nanostructured membranes were released from the substrate through photolithography and RIE from the backside. (B1) The bottom substrate fabrication begins with a double-side-polished Si wafer (thickness: 300 \u00b5m). (B2) Using a photoresist mask, a precisely controlled 4 \u00b5m recess was created through RIE to generate the FP cavity gap. (B3) Next, a 300 nm-thick Al2O3 layer was deposited using an e-beam evaporator and patterned. (B4) Using a single Bosch process, concentric shallow trenches and a deep trench were etched. The shallow trenches were created to serve as reservoirs during the epoxy bonding process to prevent any of the adhesive from overflowing into the FP cavity. The deep trenches were created for the easy separation of bottom chips (bottom parts of the sensors) from the wafer. (B5) The Al2O3 masking layer was removed in BOE. Finally, a medical grade epoxy was applied along the sides of the top nanostructured membrane chip and the bottom chip to create a hermetically sealed FP sensor implant.\n\nThe sensors were placed on a tilt stage, which allows for variation of the incident angle, and were probed by a 20\u00d7 objective lens interfaced with an NIR light source (HL-2000, Ocean Optics), a mini-spectrometer (Maya200 Pro), Ocean Optics), and a CCD camera (Thorlabs, Inc). For linearity measurements, the sensors were placed in a custom-build pressure-controlled chamber. The hydrostatic pressure was between 0 to 32 mmHg and increased at steps of 0.2 mmHg. The output from the sensors were referenced against a digital pressure gauge (1210 Pressure Sensor, TE Connectivity Ltd.) with an accuracy of \u00b1 0.5%. An in-house IOP detection algorithm on MATLAB was used to rapidly calculate the IOP based on the peak locations of the captured reflection spectra (Supplementary Fig. S15).\n\nFluorescently labelled bovine serum albumin (A13100, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) protein with molecular weight of 66 kDa and streptavidin (S21375, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) were used for the protein adsorption studies of the control, flat and nanostructured Si3N4 samples. The BSA and streptavidin were dissolved separately in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 10 mM, pH 7.4) to a concentration of 2 mM. The substrates were rinsed with PBS to rehydrate the surfaces. All the sample substrates were then immersed in both protein solutions separately and were incubated at 4\u00b0C for 24 h. The samples were then removed from the protein solutions, gently washed three times with PBS, and rinsed once with deionized water to remove the PBS salt. Surface protein adsorption was imaged using a Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash4.0 V2 Digital CMOS camera on a Nikon Eclipse 80i fluorescence microscope with a 10X objective. ImageJ/FIJI (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) was used to quantify the protein adsorption data on 12 different imaging areas from each sample. All images were converted into binary images with a fixed threshold to enable sample comparison. Statistical methods used to analyse the data were obtained using Prism (GraphPad Software).\n\nA culture of chemically competent E. coli (Edvotek) was used directly after purchase and transformed with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing and ampicillin-resistant plasmid pFluoroGreen\u2122 (Edvotek) followed by plating on selective agar for overnight (O/N) incubation at 37\u00b0C. The bacteria were then inoculated in fresh lysogeny broth (LB) with 100 \u00b5g/mL ampicillin and isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and incubated O/N at 37\u00b0C under gentle shaking (250 rpm). Upon recovery, the bacteria were diluted in fresh LB to an OD600 \u2013 0.25. Two sets of autoclaved substrates consisting of positive control, flat Si3N4 and nanostructured Si3N4 were incubated with 2 mL of the bacterial culture. The sets were used for fluorescence imaging and colony-forming unit (CFU) counts. After 4-hour incubation under gentle shaking (100 rpm), the substrates were washed with 1X PBS and placed in a sonication bath for 15 minutes. The substrates for fluorescence intensity measurements were analyzed using a wide-field epifluorescence microscope (10\u00d7 objective, Leica DMI 600, Leica AG). For CFU counts, a 10\u22125 serial dilution was performed for the control and flat Si3N4 while a 10\u22124 serial dilution was performed for the nanostructured Si3N4. The bacterial suspension from the substrates were then plated onto 3 selective agar plates per substrate. Statistical methods used to analyse the data were obtained using Prism (GraphPad Software).\n\nThree sets of autoclaved substrates consisting of positive control, flat Si3N4, and nanostructured Si3N4 were incubated in complete Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) (10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% 100\u00d7 penicillin/streptomycin) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 30 minutes. The medium was then aspirated followed by re-addition of fresh complete DMEM. HeLa cells (ATCC, maintained at low passages to avoid contamination) at a fixed concentration of 250,000 mL\u22121 were seeded on each substrate and measurements were collected at 24-hour time point measurements, three in total. At each 24-hour time point, one set of substrates were incubated in a staining reagent consisting of fresh complete FluoroBrite DMEM (10% FBS, 1% 100\u00d7 penicillin/streptomycin, 1:1000 Hoechst 33342, and 1:1000 SYTOX green) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 15 minutes. Hoechst 33342 (excitation/emission ~ 350/461 nm) and SYTOX Green (excitation/emission ~ 554/567 nm) probes were used to stain the nuclei of adherent HeLa cells on the surfaces under test for live imaging (Fig. 2i). Hoechst 33342 is nonspecific of either dead or live cells and provides an estimate of total adherent cell density, whereas SYTOX Green is impermeant into live cells and functions as an indicator of cell death. The co-localization of the two nucleic acid markers was used to ascertain viability ratios (dead/live) for each surface. For the total adherent cell density measurement, 10 representative images were obtained through wide-field epifluorescence microscopy (10\u00d7 objective, 2 mm diameter of field area, Leica AG) by scanning a fixed 2 cm \u00d7 2 cm substrate of each surface. Using a fixed field area and the representative images, an average adherent cell density (count/mm2) was obtained for each surface. An estimate of viability was computed as an average ratio of number of dead cells and live cells per field-of-view taken over 10 representative images. The co-localization of the two labels yielded the number of dead cells per representative field-of-view. The number of live cells was obtained by subtracting the number of dead cells from the total cell count tagged by Hoechst 33342 alone. The ImageJ/FIJI software was used to perform all required measurements. Statistical methods used to analyse the data were obtained using Prism (GraphPad Software).\n\nThe sensors, mounted on silicone haptics, were folded and inserted into the anterior chamber through a 2.8-mm corneal incision15. Upon spontaneous unfolding, the haptics were positioned into the iridocorneal angles. A custom-built hand-held detection system was used for the in vivo IOP measurements from the nanostructured IOP sensor. The system was interfaced with a high-resolution NIR mini-spectrometer (Maya200 Pro, Ocean Optics) and a portable tungsten halogen light source (HL-2000, Ocean Optics). To obtain a single IOP measurement, spectra were captured for a 60-seconds period with an integration time of 10 milliseconds per spectrum, resulting in 6000 spectra. Many of these measurements are influenced by naturally induced respiratory and subtle eye motions of the rabbits, which cause the angle of incidence to deviate from normal and increases error. Hence, 100 representative reflection spectra with the highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were chosen out of 6000 spectra and used to calculate the IOP. An in-house IOP detection algorithm on MATLAB was used to rapidly calculate the IOP based on the peak locations of the captured reflection spectra (Fig. S15). Rebound tonometry was performed using a hand-held off-the-shelf system (TonoVet).\n\nOnce harvested, the sensors were rinsed in 1\u00d7 PBS with 0.02% NaN3 and incubated in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 30 minutes at room temperature (RT) followed by O/N incubation at 4\u00b0C. Then, the sensors were rinsed in 1\u00d7 PBS with 0.02% NaN3 followed by incubation in freshly prepared quenching buffer (1\u00d7 PBS with 0.02% NaN3 and 50 mM NH4Cl) for 15 minutes at RT. Following quenching, the sensors were rinsed again in 1\u00d7 PBS with 0.02% NaN3. The sensors were then incubated in blocking buffer (1\u00d7 PBS with 0.02% NaN3, 2% BSA and 0.25% Triton\u2122 X-100) O/N at RT with gentle shaking (20 rpm). For staining, the sensors were incubated in 1 mL staining reagent containing blocking buffer with 1:1000 DAPI 405 (cell nucleus marker), 1:500 Phalloidin 488 (cell F-actin marker), and 1:500 MMP-2 594 (matrix metalloproteinases marker)) O/N at RT with gentle shaking (20 rpm) followed by 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. Following staining, the sensors were washed in blocking buffer several times followed by incubation O/N at RT with gentle shaking (20 rpm). All confocal imaging was performed with the sensors fully immersed in blocking buffer to retain the morphology of the tissue.\n\nImaging for in vivo biocompatibility analysis was performed using a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM 880 with Airyscan, Carl Zeiss AG). Z-stack images (step size: 2.5 \u00b5m, range: 500 \u00b5m) were captured using a 25\u00d7 EPI objective with immersion oil, and controlled by Zeiss ZEN 2.1 software. A 2\u00d72 tiling with 10% overlap section of each sensor field of view was captured and then stitched together using an imaging software (Zeiss ZEN, Carl Zeiss AG). All subsequent image analyses were performed with ImageJ/FIJI software.\n\nAll animals were treated in accordance with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. All animal research was conducted under protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California San Francisco (Protocol no. AN110948)."}
