{"title": "Construct design, biophysical, and biochemical characterization of the fusion core from mouse hepatitis virus (a coronavirus) spike protein", "body": "Coronavirus in the family Coronaviridae [1] . The family comprises a large and diverse group of enveloped viruses with a positive-stranded RNA genome of approximately 31 kb [2, 3] . The members of the family Coronaviridae exhibit broad host range, infecting many mammalian and avian species and causing upper respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and central nervous system diseases. In humans and fowl, coronaviruses primarily cause upper respiratory tract infections, while porcine and bovine coronaviruses establish enteric infections that result in severe economic loss [4] . The emergence of atyp-ical pneumonia with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and identiWcation of the etiologic agent as a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have attracted the attention of the scientists and ordinary people for the importance of the family Coronaviridae [5, 6] .\n\nThe coronavirus infection starts with fusion of the viral and cellular membranes [7] . This process is mediated by viral envelope spike (S) protein, which is thought to be a trimer on the virion. The MHV S protein is cleaved in the Golgi apparatus, by a host cell protease, into two similarly sized subunits: amino terminal S1 and carboxyl terminal S2. It is believed that the S1 subunit forms the globular head of the spike, whereas the S2 subunit forms the transmembrane stalk portion [8] . Sequence analysis suggests that the coronavirus spike protein has the structural features of a type I membrane protein, including a transmembrane domain near the carboxyl terminus of S2 and a hydrophobic signal peptide at the N-terminus of S1.\n\nThe S2 domain has an internal fusion peptide and two heptad repeat (HR) regions designated HR1 and HR2 [8, 9] . HR2 is located close to the transmembrane region, and HR1 is some 170 amino acids of its upstream. The HR regions are found in fusion proteins of many diVerent viruses and form an important characteristic of class I viral fusion proteins (there are two classes of the viral fusion proteins under the current classiWcation) [10] [11] [12] [13] .\n\nTypical class I viral fusion protein contains several notable features. It has a fusion peptide at the amino terminus that is thought to insert directly into the target membrane during the viral fusion process [12] . Carboxyl-terminal to the fusion peptide are two regions containing 4,3 hydrophobic (heptad) repeats, sequence motifs, which form a coiled-coil structure in the postfusion state after series of the conformational changes of the fusion protein [12] . This coiled-coil structure is a stable, protease resistant core in the ectodomain of enveloped glycoprotein (or fusion protein), named as viral fusion core [12] . The fusion core complex consists of trimer of HR1/HR2 heterodimers, therefore, it is also called 6-helix bundle. The MHV fusion core complex has been conWrmed biophysically and biochemically [14] but its crystal structure is yet to be elucidated. We previously developed a method to prepare this core complex for other viruses [15] [16] [17] by linking the HR1 and HR2 as a single chain. It was shown to be an eVective method to prepare diVractable crystals for such a core complex.\n\nHere we deployed this method to MHV HR1/HR2 complex and indeed it shows that the single chain HR1/HR2 (detonated as 2-helix) could be prepared as a trimer of HR1/HR2 heterodimer suitable for good-quality crystal preparation.\n\nThe -helix structure of the two HR regions of the S protein of MHV was predicted by LearnCoil-VMF program (http://nightingale.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/vmf), which was speciWcally developed for identiWcation of potential coiled-coil HR regions in viral fusion proteins by Kim and colleagues at Massachusetts Institute of Technology [18] . The proteinase K resistent regions of HR1 and HR2 have been identiWed by Bosch and colleagues [14] . The HR regions were chosen based on the prediction of LearnCoil-VMF and the previous published data [14] . The HR1 region used was derived from amino acids 968-1027 and HR2 from 1216 to 1253 as shown in Fig. 1 .\n\nThe genes encoding the HR1 and HR2 regions of MHV were synthesized by PCR using eight synthesized primers according to the published sequences of murine coronavirus MHV strain A59 (Gene Bank No. M18379). The codon usage was optimized according to Escherichia coli expression preferences. HR1 and HR2 were connected by an eight amino acid linker (GGSGGSGG, Fig. 1 .

Amino acid sequences of the HR1 and HR2 regions are shown and the 2-helix construct is schematically represented. single letter abbreviation of amino acids) and a 6-His tag was introduced by PCR primers at the C-terminus to facilitate the protein puriWcation. The choice of the eight amino acids as linker was based on our previous successful work on other viral fusion core [15] [16] [17] . The constructs were cloned into the NdeI and XhoI sites (introduced by synthetic PCR primers) of pET22b expression vector (Novagen). Under this construction strategy, two extra amino acids were created between the C-terminal end of the HR2 and 6-His tag. They are \"Leu-Glu\" for XhoI restriction cloning site (CTCGAG for nucleotides). This construct was named as MHV 2helix (Fig. 1) . The construction was veriWed by direct DNA sequencing.\n\nThe primers overlapped with each other for 12-18 nucleotide bases. The NdeI and XhoI restriction sites were introduced by primer F and P8 (as shown below in capitalized/italic denominators). The gene of MHV 2helix was obtained by two-step PCR. Firstly, the eight synthetic primers (0.2 OD/ l) were mixed and the PCR reactions were run with the following conditions: denatured at 94\u00b0C for 5 min and then 15 cycles of 94\u00b0C, 0.5 min; 55\u00b0C, 1 min; and 72\u00b0C, 1 min, For the second PCR, the Wrst PCR product was used as template and the new PCR product was ampliWed by using primers F and P8 at the following conditions: denatured at 94\u00b0C for 5 min and then 32 cycles of 94\u00b0C, 0.5 min; 55\u00b0C, 1 min; and 72\u00b0C, 1 min.\n\nPrimers used for making the MHV 2-helix construct:\n\nF: 5\u0408-atgcgaattcCATATGgaaaaccagaaaatgatcgc-3\u0408 P1:5\u0408-gaaaaccagaaaatgatcgcttctgctttcaacaacgctctgggtgct atccaggacg-3\u0408 P2:5\u0408-gactggattttgcccagagcagagttagtagcgtcgaagccgtcctg gatagcacccag-3\u0408 P3:5\u0408-ctctgggcaaaatccagtctgttgttaacgctaacgctgaagctctg aacaacctgctg-3\u0408 P4:5\u0408-cagagaagcagagatagcaccgaaacggttagacagctggttcag caggttgttcagagc-3\u0408 P5:5\u0408-gctatctctgcttctctgggtggttctggtggttctggtggtgacctgtc tctggacttc-3\u0408 P6:5\u0408-catttcgtaagtcaggtccagcagagtaacgttcagtttttcgaagtc cagagacaggtc-3\u0408 P7:5\u0408-gacctgacttacgaaatgaaccgtatccaggacgctatcaaaaaac tgaacgaatc-3\u0408 P8:5\u0408-ctagCTCGAGttctttcaggttgatgtaagattcgttcagttttttg atagcg-3\u0408\n\nThe recombinant pET22b plasmids (MHV 2-helix) were transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). A single colony of the E. coli BL21 (DE3) transformed with the positive plasmid was grown in 2\u00a3 YT medium containing 100-g/mL of ampicillin in a 37\u00b0C incubator. When the culture density (OD 600 ) reached 0.6-0.8, the culture was induced with 0.2 mM IPTG and continuously grown for an additional 10 h at 16\u00b0C before the cells were harvested. Bacterial cells were homogenized by sonication in phosphate-buVered saline (PBS, 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl). The lysates were clariWed by centrifugation at 18,000g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatants were loaded on Ni-NTA column (QIAGEN) that was equilibrated with PBS. The contaminated protein was washed with washing buVer (1\u00a3 PBS, 60 mM imidazole) over 10 column volumes and the target protein was eluted with elution buVer (1\u00a3 PBS, 500 mM imidazole) for Wve column volumes. The resultant protein 2-helix was concentrated to a proper concentration by ultra-Wltration (10 kDa cut-oV). Proteins were analyzed by 10% Tricine SDS-PAGE. For further puriWcation, the concentrated 2-helix protein was loaded onto a Superdex 75 HR10/30 (Pharmacia Biotech) column with an Akta PuriWer System (Pharmacia Biotech). The fractions of the peak were collected and analyzed by a 10% Tricine SDS-PAGE. The peak molecular mass was estimated by comparison with the protein standards run on the same column (see Table 1 ).\n\nThe puriWed 2-helix protein after gel-Wltration was dialyzed against cross-linking buVer (50 mM Hepes, pH 8.3; 100 mM NaCl) and concentrated to approximately 2 mg/mL by ultra-Wltration (10 kDa cut-oV). Protein con- Table 1 PuriWcation process of the 2-helix protein centrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm, assuming an A280 of 0.22 for a 1.0 mg/mL. The proteins were cross-linked with ethyleneglycol bis(succinimidylsuccinate) (EGS) (Sigma). The reactions were incubated for 1 h on ice at diVerent concentrations of EGS (0, 0.1, 0.5, and 1.5 mM EGS) and quenched with 50 mM glycine. Cross-linked samples were analyzed by 10% Tricine SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions.\n\nCircular dichroism (CD) spectra were performed on a Jasco J-715 spectrophotometer. The working buVer was PBS (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.3; 150 mM NaCl). Wavelength spectra were recorded at 25\u00b0C using a 0.1cm path-length cuvette. Thermodynamic stability was measured at 222 nm by recording the CD signals in the temperature range of 25-90\u00b0C with a scan rate of 5\u00b0C/ min.\n\nThe selenomethionine derivative of the MHV 2-helix was expressed using E. coli BL21 (DE3) cultured in minimal media M9 containing 60 mg/L L-SetMet. When the culture optical density (OD 600 ) reached 0.6, the further six amino acids (lysine, threonine, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, and valine) were added to the culture. The culture was then induced with 0.2 mM IPTG and grown for an additional 10 h at 16\u00b0C. PuriWcation of the selenomethionene-incorporated MHV 2-helix was performed as that used for the native MHV 2-helix.\n\nThe puriWed and desalted 2-helix proteins (both native and SeMet-incorporated 2-helix) were exchanged into the buVer of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and then analyzed by using Bruker Daltonics BiXex III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer for the molecular mass of the polypeptide.\n\nBased on the prediction of the LearnCoil-VMF program and the work by Bosch et al. [14] , the HR1 and HR2 regions of MHV-A59 have been chosen in this study (Fig. 1) . The single-chain construct of the fusion core HR1/HR2 was made as 2-helix as described under Materials and methods. The schematic representation of this construct is shown in Fig. 1 . As expected from our previous work on paramyxovirus fusion core 2-helix proteins [15] [16] [17] , the MHV 2-helix polypeptide preparation from the E. coli expression system in this study was expressed in high level and soluble in the physiological condition, i.e., in the buVers of either PBS or pH 8.0, Tris (Fig. 2 ). This implies that the protein has most likely been folded correctly. The protein has been shown to be soluble in the concentration of up to 40 mg/mL.\n\nThe puriWed proteins were concentrated to about 10 mg/mL in PBS and analyzed by gel Wltration and chemical cross-linking for estimation of the molecular mass. The MHV 2-helix protein was eluted between the corresponding positions of 52 and 14 kDa (Fig. 3) . In comparison, the computed molecular mass of 2-helix (with 6\u00a3 Histidine) is about 13 kDa, which indicates that the 2-helix might form oligomers (about 40 kDa). MALDI-TOFF results showed that the 2-helix monomer is about 12.6 kDa with two possible charges (Fig. 4A) . Subsequently, chemical cross-linking demonstrated that the 2-helix protein oligomer was, in fact, a trimer (Fig. 5) from the estimated molecular mass of the cross-linked products. In addition, the content of trimer increased with the concentration increase of the chemical cross-linker. Clear trimer band with monomer could also be seen if the samples (reduced by SDS loading buVer) were not heated at 100\u00b0C (Lane 2 in Fig. 5A ). All this indicates that the 2-helix protein forms a stable trimeric complex.\n\nThe secondary structure of the 2-helix protein was examined by CD spectroscopy as described under Materials and methods. The absorption curve showed that the 2-helix protein had double minima at 208 and 222 nm (Fig. 6A) , consistent with typical -helix structure. The thermal stability test by CD spectroscopy indicated that trimer formation of the 2-helix was very stable in PBS (Fig. 6B) , indicating that the 2-helix trimer represents the core structure of the post-fusion state of the coiled-coil bundle, as thoroughly studied for other viral fusion proteins [10] [11] [12] [19] [20] [21] .\n\nTo facilitate the phase-determination of the 2-helix crystals, selenomethionine derivative preparations were made and the incorporation of the selenomethionine into the 2-helix preparation was conWrmed by MALDI-TOFF mass spectrometry (Fig. 4B) . Moreover, it seems that the start-codon ATG-encoded methionine remains in the expressed 2-helix protein as the molecular increase between the native and SeMet derivative indicates that three methionines were replaced by SeMet (molecular mass increases by 3 \u00a3 (79 \u00a1 32) D 141 Da). The crystal structure has now been solved at 2.4 \u00c5 and has been reported elsewhere [22] . \n\nOur results do show that the strategy we used for other enveloped viruses, such as paramyxoviruses [15] [16] [17] , to analyze the fusion core in the form of single chain HR1 and HR2, can be used for coronavirus. Coronavirus does most likely adapt to the similar fusion mechanism to other viruses with a class I fusion protein. A clear crystal structure of this fusion core from a member of coronavirus is now known and has answered some important questions [22] ."}
