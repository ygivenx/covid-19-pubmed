{"title": "Current State and Predicting Future Scenario of Highly Infected Nations for COVID-19 Pandemic", "body": "Since the first report of COVID-19 in Wuhan province in the month of December, the virus has spread across the globe through foreign travelers at rapid pace. The SARS-CoV2 is transmitted human to human among close contacts (within about 6 feet) [1] and has mean incubation period of 6.4 days with range of 2.1 to 11.1 days [2] . Asymptotic spread has made detection of virus very difficult. Reverse transcription PCR is widely used for detecting COVID-19 virus which may take few hours and days to obtain results. Observing threat to public health, World Health Organization (WHO) has declared novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak to be \"public health emergency of international concern\" on Jan. 30, 2020 [3] and on the 11th of March the disease was declared a global pandemic [4] .\n\nMany prediction models are being proposed for the current pandemic [4] [5] namely SIRD model [7] , GLEaM [8] , Mechanistic-statistical SIR [8] , SEIRUS model [9] . These models are often complex and have multiple parameters. Here we propose a simple prediction method for the current COVID-19 pandemic based on only reported positive COID-19 cases. The current study is aimed to predict future scenario of eight highly infected countries namely Italy, Spain, Germany, France, United States, Iran, South Korea and India.\n\n.

Initially a smaller number of people are tested due to longer incubation period of virus, (2.1 to 11.1 days with mean of 6.4 days) [2] which leads to low positive cases. This is followed by higher testing samples reporting high number of positive cases.\n\nPhase 2 -In this phase the is above 100 but is decreasing at a certain rate. There is currently popular opinion about flattening the epidemic curve to reduce the load on healthcare sector [13] [14] . The decay of decides the epidemic curve, a fast decay helps in flattening the curve whereas slow decay would lead to steep normal curve. .

US observed its Phase 1 from Feb 29 to Mar 6 with of 4660. Now currently it is in Phase 2 with a slow decay of . This slow decay would take form of steep normal curve leading to huge increase in and is expected to reach 400,000 positive cases within Apr 3. Immediate actions need to be undertaken to control the disease in United States. WHO said US could be next epicenter for COVID-19 [15] . .

It has passed Phase 1, which was from Feb 29-Mar 6. Now it's in Phase 2, with a fluctuating value. It is predicted to be in Phase 2 for next two weeks. Positive cases reported have history of foreign travel or have come in contact with infected person. Community spread has not yet been reported from India. Coming weeks are crucial for containing COVID-19 pandemic.

Rapid, low-cost and large-scale testing methods for COVID-19 have been summarized by [17, 19] \n\nThe current method helps to understand the current state of Epidemic and can give fair prediction of Epidemic for upcoming weeks. Rapid and large-scale testing helps in controlling the COVID-19 outbreak. Initial screening and quarantining people with history of foreign travel helps in further to prevent spread of virus into community. As no vaccine has been developed up till now and control measures are the best option. Quick transition from Phase 2 to Phase 3 is crucial in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n.
