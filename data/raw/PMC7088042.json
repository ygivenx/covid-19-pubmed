{"title": "Respiratory viral infections during the 2009\u20132010 winter season in Central England, UK: incidence and patterns of multiple virus co-infections", "body": "Respiratory viral infections are a large cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Acute viral respiratory infections are the most common infections in man [1, 2]. Young children have, on average, 6\u20138 infections per year and adults have 2\u20134 infections per year [3].\n\nThe most common viruses that infect the respiratory tract include influenza A and B, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial viruses (RSVs), parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, enteroviruses, human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human bocavirus (HboV) [3, 4]. Acute upper respiratory tract infections (AURTIs) often include symptoms which can overlap with those of mild influenza and include pharyngitis, rhinorrhoea, cough, sneezing, fever, malaise and myalgia [3]. Most of the AURTI viruses can also cause lower respiratory tract infections [1].\n\nDiagnostic methods for respiratory viruses include viral culture, serology, antigen detection and nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAATs), such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Virus culture has long been the \u201cgold standard\u201d and can detect a wide range of viruses, including previously unknown viruses. It also confirms that what is detected is viable. Culture is, however, labour-intensive and slow to produce results. Likewise, serology to detect antibody response to infection may only produce positive results up to two weeks after infection. These two techniques, therefore, have little routine diagnostic value, as most infections will have resolved before the results are available [1, 5]. Immunofluorescence/antigen detection tests can allow rapid detection but are subjective, rely on the experience of investigators and lack sensitivity [1, 5].\n\nNAAT tests including multiplex assays which allow testing for several viruses at once and the detection of multiple infections are now becoming the standard method of laboratory diagnosis for respiratory infections. NAATs have the advantages of speed, sensitivity and specificity, which allows more prompt treatment, infection control and prophylaxis, where appropriate [1, 5, 6]. During the study period, the standard routine test for respiratory viruses diagnosis used by the Health Protection Agency Public Health Laboratory (HPA PHL) Birmingham, UK, was a panel of multiplex real-time PCR assays detecting influenzas A and B, swine lineage influenza A(H1N1), RSV A and B, HMPV, parainfluenzas 1, 2, 3 and 4, rhinovirus and adenovirus.\n\nDuring the winter of 2009/2010, the results of the routine respiratory virus PCR workload were analysed to investigate the prevalence and impact of the most common respiratory viruses in the West Midlands region, England. The results were compared with national figures for England and virus prevalence in different age groups, temporal variation and rates of co-infection were also investigated.\n\nSpecimens were received from patients with acute respiratory illness from hospitals and general practitioners within the West Midlands region of central England, UK. Specimens included nasopharyngeal aspirates, nose and throat swabs, and bronchoalveolar lavages.\n\nRespiratory virus detection was carried out using real-time PCR for influenza A, influenza B, RSV, HMPV, parainfluenza viruses, rhinovirus and adenovirus, as previously described [7].\n\nData on all specimens received at HPA PHL Birmingham for respiratory virus investigations from late September 2009 to April 2010 were downloaded from the local laboratory information management system. The downloaded data included patient identifiers, specimen receipt dates, location at which specimens were taken, laboratory reference numbers and respiratory virus PCR detection test results.\n\nDuplicate specimens from the same patient (within one week of another specimen) were identified and excluded when the results were the same.\n\nAll specimens in the data set which had not been tested against the full respiratory virus panels used by the laboratory were excluded from the analysis. Entries with unknown locations or unknown dates of birth were excluded.\n\nData analysis was carried out using Microsoft Excel software. Poisson regression analysis was carried out using Stata (StataCorp) software at the HPA Statistics Unit.\n\nFigure 1 shows the numbers of specimens with positive virus detection results over time.\n\n\nInfluenza A(H1N1) showed a peak of increased detection from mid-October, tailing off at the end of December, with almost none from the end of January onwards. Influenza B was rarely detected and, apart from influenza A(H1N1), no other influenza A strains were detected.\n\nAdenovirus and parainfluenza showed no temporal peak and were more or less evenly distributed across the time period.\n\nRSV showed distinct seasonality, with a clear peak from the end of November to January, and was much less frequently detected prior to November and after February. Despite fewer detections, HMPV showed seasonality, with a pattern very similar to that of RSV.\n\nRhinovirus detections averaged approximately 30 positive specimens per month from the end of September to the end of December, and then from January to April, this halved to about 15 specimens per month.\n\nThe correlation between age and the types of viruses detected is shown in Table 1.\n\n\nThe under 5s group comprise by far the largest age group represented in the specimens received and also have the highest percentage of positives (65.3 %). The 15\u201324-year-olds are the least represented age group in the specimens received. The over 65s showed the lowest positivity rate (30.3 %).\n\nInfluenza B was too rarely detected to comment about its distribution by age of patients. Influenza A(H1N1) showed a distinct peak in the 25\u201344 years age group and a distinct trough in the over 65s. When this is considered against the total numbers of positive specimens, only 6.0 and 16.9 % of positive specimens in the under 5s and over 65s groups, respectively, were positive for influenza A(H1N1). In the 25\u201344 years age group, however, 50.9 % of positive specimens were positive for influenza A(H1N1).\n\nAdenovirus, RSV, HMPV and rhinovirus were found most frequently in the under 5s. For RSV and adenovirus, this is also seen as a peak of the total percentage of positives in this age group (Table 1). HMPV was detected most often in the under 5s but, when considered as a percentage of the total number of positives in each group (Table 1), it reached its highest percentage of positives (18.4 %) in the over 65s and is lowest as a percentage of positives in the 15\u201324 and 25\u201344 years age groups. Although rhinovirus was detected most often in the under 5s, the rate of rhinovirus in each age group as a percentage of the total number of positives does not vary much (25.0 to 32.5 %).\n\nThe parainfluenza viruses were mostly detected in the under 5s, but the percentages of parainfluenza of any type in all ages groups always represented a small but fairly consistent percentage of the total number of positive samples.\n\nEighty-six percent (2,105) of positive specimens were positive for only one respiratory virus, whereas 323 (13.2 %) specimens were positive for two viruses, 22 (0.9 %) were positive for three viruses and four (0.2 %) were positive for four viruses.\n\nRhinovirus and RSV were the two viruses most frequently detected with other respiratory viruses (Table 2). However, parainfluenza and adenovirus had a greater proportion of their detections as co-detections with other viruses (46.7 and 33.5 %, respectively). Influenza A(H1N1) showed the lowest rate of co-detection with other viruses (10.4 %).\n\n\nTable 3 shows the degree of positive or negative associations between different viruses. Influenza B was excluded from this analysis, as the number of detections in total was so low.\n\n\nAll patterns of association, positive or negative, whether statistically significant or not, were found to be reciprocal (Table 3).\n\nThe most common co-detection was of RSV and rhinovirus. Poisson regression analysis also showed a statistically significant association between these two viruses (p-value 0.002).\n\nAll non-influenza viruses detected had a lower prevalence in the influenza A(H1N1)-positive population than that in the total number of specimens. Influenza A(H1N1) also had a lower prevalence in all samples positive for other viruses than would be expected from random associations. Poisson regression analysis confirmed the statistical significance of the negative associations between influenza A and HMPV (p-value 0.013), and influenza A and rhinovirus (p-value 0.026).\n\nStatistically significant positive associations were found between adenovirus and RSV, parainfluenza and rhinovirus (p-value <0.000 for all three pairs).\n\nStatistical analysis using Poisson regression also suggested significant positive associations between parainfluenza and rhinovirus (p-value 0.003) and rhinovirus and RSV (p-value 0.002), despite the fact that each of these viruses actually has a slightly lower prevalence in the population positive for the associated virus than in all specimens (Table 3).\n\nThe first notable feature of the analysis of the 2009\u20132010 winter season routine specimen data is that nearly half of all the specimens tested had no virus detected. Assuming that specimens were taken from symptomatic patients, it is evident that many cases of respiratory tract infection are not due to the viruses investigated in this study. These undiagnosed infections could be due to bacteria; other respiratory viruses such as bocaviruses, enteroviruses or coronaviruses or even as-yet-unknown respiratory pathogens.\n\nThe pattern of specimen receipt and positivity in the West Midlands over the 2009\u20132010 winter season showed the classic Northern Hemisphere midwinter peak of respiratory infection. The pattern of virus detection throughout this period also corresponded with established patterns of seasonality [8].\n\nHPA data from England and Wales (http://www.hpa.org.uk/web/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1247728930779) shows a double peak of influenza in the summer of 2009 and relatively early in the winter when compared with previous years. This was a highly unusual feature of the most recent influenza A pandemic, as influenza A usually has a defined peak from December to March. The fact that no other strain of influenza A was detected either in the summer or the winter demonstrates how completely this new strain has replaced the previous circulating seasonal influenza.\n\nAnalysis of the winter respiratory virus data by patient age showed that the under 5s form an epidemiological group distinct from older children and adults. Their rate of specimen positivity is highest, their frequency of infection with viruses is different (e.g. higher RSV and lower influenza A) from other age groups and the percentage of multiple virus detections is about twice that of the older age groups.\n\nThe co-detection of different respiratory viruses is well documented [1, 4\u20136, 9\u201315]. The results of this study\u2019s analysis suggest that co-detections are not totally random and most associations appear to be reciprocal\u2014observations also made by Brunstein et al. [10] and Greer et al. [12] in their surveys of acute respiratory tract infections.\n\nThe most striking association observed between respiratory viruses in this study was the lower prevalence of influenza A(H1N1) in patients positive for adenovirus, RSV, parainfluenza, HMPV and rhinovirus and vice versa, which reached statistical significance with HMPV and rhinovirus (Table 3).\n\nFrom seasonal patterns of incidence, it has been suggested that interference between different respiratory viruses may contribute to their seasonal patterns and that RSV and rhinovirus outbreaks may delay influenza outbreaks [16, 17]. The patterns observed in the West Midlands during the 2009\u20132010 winter season showed the rhinovirus and influenza peaks to be concurrent (Fig. 1). If associations were random, these co-incident peaks would lead us to expect an increased incidence of co-detection. Interestingly, despite these overlapping peaks, the rate of positivity for rhinovirus in the influenza A(H1N1)-positive population was observed to be lower than would be expected from random associations.\n\nGreer et al.\u2019s study also noted negative associations of influenza A with rhinovirus and RSV, but concluded that rhinovirus, RSV and HMPV were most likely to be associated with reduced co-detection of other viruses [12]. Brunstein et al.\u2019s study also suggested decreased incidence of influenza A in backgrounds of RSV, parainfluenza, HMPV and rhinovirus, and decreased incidence of RSV, HMPV and rhinovirus in an influenza A-positive background, but none of these reached statistical significance in their study [10].\n\nThe potential negative associations observed between RSV and parainfluenza and between HMPV and RSV have also been noted by both Greer et al. [12] and Brunstein et al. [10], which suggests that these observations are not co-incidental, despite not reaching statistical significance in the study.\n\nThe positive associations we observed with adenovirus and RSV, parainfluenza and rhinovirus, and rhinovirus with parainfluenza and RSV have not been observed in previous studies.\n\nThis study did not analyse the clinical significance of multiple viral detection/infection. The clinical significance of respiratory co-infections is debatable and requires more study. Studies of respiratory viral infections in children reviewed by Tregoning and Schwarze [18] and Paranhos-Baccal\u00e0 et al. [5] showed differences in clinical severity between single and dual infections, but the impact of such dual infections appears to depend on which viruses co-infect.\n\nThe question of whether the co-detection of viruses really indicates co-infection is also one that has not been fully answered. It is known that PCR can detect genomic material after clinical symptoms have ended [3, 19] and in the absence of respiratory symptoms [20]. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR on nasopharyngeal aspirates has been proposed as a means of differentiating true infections from low-level shedding [6]. Whether this method would still be valid for less standardised specimens like nose and throat swabs and whether a correlation between viral load and severity of disease can be determined remain to be seen.\n\nThis analysis of viruses detected during the West Midlands 2009\u20132010 winter season has some limitations. The sample is drawn from a somewhat skewed population. Most of the specimens were from hospitalised patients and those needing medical care, whilst the majority of respiratory infections won\u2019t present to healthcare, especially in adults, due to the self-limiting nature of the infections [3, 21]. This sample is not, therefore, strictly representative of the wider population, although it is drawn from it.\n\nIn conclusion, this study found fairly classical age and seasonal distributions of respiratory viruses during the Northern Hemisphere 2009\u20132010 winter season in the West Midlands region of the UK. Patterns of co-detection of different respiratory viruses were found not to be random and most associations were reciprocal, either positively or negatively. The pandemic strain of influenza A(H1N1) was notable in that it was the least likely to be co-detected with another respiratory virus."}
