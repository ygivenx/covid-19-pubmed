{"title": "Characterization of Rv0888, a Novel Extracellular Nuclease from Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "body": "The SignalP server revealed a signal sequence (1 to 31 residues) in the Rv0888 amino acid sequence and, as this hydrophobic sequence might increase the difficulty of expression, the fragment of rv0888 from M. tuberculosis H37Rv was cloned without the predicted signal sequence. In order to purify the protein, Rv0888 was expressed as a 6 \u00d7 His-tagged protein in E. coli. Though it was expressed in inclusion body form, Rv0888 was renatured and purified via a Ni2+ affinity chromatography resin (Fig. 1A). Then, the eluted Rv0888 protein was loaded onto an anion exchange chromatography column (Fig. 1B) and subsequently passed through a gel filtration chromatography resin, subsequently resulting in greater than 98% protein purity (Fig. 1C).\n\nThe purified Rv0888 protein was analyzed by mass spectrometry and peptide mass fingerprinting results were submitted to Mascot and used to search the SwissProt database. The analysis returned 10 results, with a score of 78 assigned to the expected protein Rv0888 (GeneBank Accession No. NP_215403.1) from M. tuberculosis H37Rv (Fig. 1D).\n\nTo verify the nuclease activity, purified Rv0888 was incubated with different nucleic acids, including linear dsDNA (PCR production), circular plasmid DNA (pGEX-6p-1 vector), chromosomal DNA (E. coli DNA) or RNA from baker\u2019s yeast. Surprisingly, all of the nucleic acids were degraded by the Rv0888 protein (Fig. 2A,B). These results indicated that Rv0888 is a non-specific nuclease.\n\nThe effect of different divalent cations on nuclease activity of Rv0888 was evaluated. In the absence of divalent cations, nuclease activity was not detected. The enzymatic activity was optimal in the presence of 5 mM CaCl2 and 5 mM MnCl2. Other divalent cations salts\u2013CaCl2, MgCl2, BaCl2 and NiCl2\u2013were demonstrated to display different stimulation effects of Rv0888 activity, and Rv0888 activity was fully inhibited by 20 mM EDTA (Table 1; Fig. 2C).\n\nThe effects of pH and temperature on Rv0888 activity towards circular plasmid DNA are displayed in Fig. 3A,C, respectively. Rv0888 had full activity across a pH range of 6.0-8.0, with maximal activity at pH 6.5 (Fig. 3D). Measurements of Rv0888 activity across a wide temperature range indicated that the optimal temperature for the Rv0888 was 41 \u00b0C (Fig. 3B).\n\nThe kinetic parameters of the Rv0888 nuclease were determined at 41 \u00b0C, pH 6.5 and including 5 mM divalent cation salts (CaCl2 and MnCl2) with two different substrates: calf thymus DNA and baker\u2019s yeast RNA. Michaelis-Menton kinetics assays revealed that the Km values toward DNA and RNA were 0.306 \u00b1 0.04 mg/mL and 0.012 \u00b1 0.01 mg/mL, respectively (Fig. 4A,B). Vmax values were found to be 600.56 U/mg/min and 241.11 U/mg/min for deoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease activities, respectively (Fig. 4A,B).\n\nThe nuclease activity of Rv0888 was inhibited by four Chinese medicine monomers (Oleuropein, 6-Gingerol, Corylifolinin, and Acteoside). As showed in Fig. 5A,B, the inhibition effect was concentration-dependent.\n\nMultiple sequence alignment of Rv0888 with related homologs indicated that nine targeted residues (N131, E267, G303, H353, D387, N389, D438, D472, and H473) were highly conserved in the endonuclease/exonuclease/phosphatase family (Fig. 6A). To identify residues in Rv0888 that are necessary for catalytic activity, specific codons corresponding to the important residues were altered by site-directed mutagenesis.\n\nTen protein variants were produced, each with a single residue of the conserved residues (N131, E267, G303, H353, D387, N389, D438, D472, H473, and D472-H473) replaced with alanine. Alanine was chosen for substitution, as it lacks a bulky side chain and therefore would be unlikely to disrupt the main chain conformation. Comparison of the variant enzyme to wild-type Rv0888 demonstrated that the D438A substitution resulted in a 92% loss of activity, the H353A and D387A substitutions resulted in a ~50% loss of activity, and both the H473A and D472A-H473A substitutions resulted in a ~30% loss of activity. The N131A, E267A, G303A, N389A, and D472A substitutions resulted in losses in activities of 10%, 4%, 6%, 11%, and 15%, respectively (Fig. 6B).\n\nThe lungs are a portal to infection by M. tuberculosis, which can adhere to and invade lung epithelial cells15. In order to determine the role of Rv0888 in mycobacterial pathogenicity, the persistence ability of M. smegmatis overexpressing Rv0888 in lung tissue was estimated. Three groups of 3 mice were infected intranasally with a dose (2 \u00d7 107 colony forming units) of the rMS strains pMV262/MS, Rv0888NS/MS, and Rv0888S/MS, respectively. Bacterial loads in lung tissue were measured at 4 h, 24 h, 4 d, 7 d, and 17 d after infection (Fig. 7). No significant difference was observed between the bacterial loads of Rv0888NS/MS and Rv0888S/MS groups at all time-points, whereas the bacterial loads of Rv0888NS/MS and Rv0888S/MS groups were remarkably higher, compared with that of pMV262/MS group, at 4 d, 7 d, and 17 d after infection. Importantly, in contrast to the almost total clearance of bacteria in the lungs of infected mice in the pMV262/MS group at 17 d, bacterial loads still persisted in mice of the Rv0888NS/MS and Rv0888S/MS groups.\n\nHistopathological analysis revealed that lungs from mice at 7 d after infection in the pMV262/MS group had no pathological changes, whereas mild hyperplasia was observed in alveolar epithelial cells of the mice in the Rv0888NS/MS group, and partial mild hematopedesis and hyperplasia were observed in alveolar epithelial cells in the Rv0888S/MS group (Fig. 8). Taken together, it was suggested that nuclease activity is required for mycobacteria to resist defensive clearance of lung tissue and may be related to mycobacterial pathogenicity.\n\nExtracellular nucleases from Gram-positive bacterium play vital roles in virulence and degrading DNA in NETs produced by neutrophils16 or macrophages17. A variety of studies characterizing extracellular nucleases have focused on the proteins that derived from Streptococcus agalactiae6, Streptococcus pyogenes18 and Staphylococcus aureus619. Though a previous report had described the intracellular nucleases in M. tuberculosis20, no data is currently available regarding extracellular nucleases from the pathogen. In our investigation, the Rv0888 protein was identified as an extracellular nuclease from M. tuberculosis for the first time.\n\nActivity characterization revealed that Rv0888 nuclease was active at temperatures ranging from 37 \u00b0C to 51 \u00b0C, with an optimal temperature of 41 \u00b0C. This temperature range is consistent with the body temperature during fever in humans and animals after M. tuberculosis infection, suggesting that Rv0888 may be related to M. tuberculosis virulence. Similar to other DNase/nucleases, Rv0888 nuclease requires divalent cations for its activity. Mn2+ and Ca2+ were found to be optimal for its nuclease activity, although other divalent cations (Mg2+, Ba2+, Ni2+) could also stimulate Rv0888 activity (Table 1). These observations indicated that either the divalent cation diameter was not a factor in accessing the Rv0888 catalytic site or that these cations bind to different amino acids to maintain activity, as previously reported for the E. coli nuclease, Colicin E921. Metal chelation, as assessed by EDTA treatment, had a strong inhibitory effect on the activity of the Rv0888 enzyme, suggesting that metal ions were obligatory for nuclease activity and that they might play vital roles in stabilizing the enzymatic structure.\n\nAmino acid substitution studies indicated that the D438 residue may play a key role in Rv0888 nuclease activity, while the H353A and D387A substitutions had a positive influence on Rv0888 activity. The importance of these residues indicate that Rv0888 differs from other bacterial extracellular nucleases which contain the conserved DRGH motif (as in S. pneumoniae EndA)22 or the degenerate DKGH motif (as in S. agalactiae Gbs0661)6. Although the Rv0888 protein showed non-specific nuclease activity, it also shares no homology to any known nucleases, as determined by the primary amino acid sequence (Supplementary Fig. S1). Thus, our data suggested that Rv0888 is a novel member of a non-specific nuclease family.\n\nTuberculosis is difficult to control due to co-infection with HIV and the emergence of virtually untreatable and/or extensively drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains. New drugs and more effective vaccines are urgently needed, thus necessitating a better understanding of the genetic basis for M. tuberculosis virulence and pathogenesis23. Interestingly, Rv0888 activity was inhibited by four Chinese medicine monomers (Oleuropein, 6-Gingerol, Corylifolinin, and Acteoside). Previous studies have concentrated on small molecule inhibitors, focusing on proteins and factors related to the biosynthesis of pathogens: limiting S. aureus entry into endothelial cells by structural analogs of ML 14124; blocking coronavirus and filovirus entry into host cells by the cysteine protease inhibitor K1177725; blocking phosphatidylglycerol-LtaS binding and inhibiting LTA synthesis in ItaS-expressin S. aureus and in Escherichia coli with compound 177126; Inhibiting A. baumannii Lipid II (an essential precursor of cell wall biosynthesis) through the use of BAS0012753827. Subsequent drug studies then shifted to cell wall proteins and proteases: small molecule inhibitors of sortase that act as an anti-infective therapy against hospital-acquired S. aureus infection without the side effects of standard antibiotics28; tetrahydrolipstatin that inhibits the phospholipase/thioesterase (Rv3802c) of M. tuberculosis29; an inhibitor of mPTPB (a virulence factor of tuberculosis) which was acquired by organocatalysis30; six small molecules that were confirmed to act as novel EndA (surface endonuclease of the S. pneumoniae) inhibitors31. Importantly, this manuscript report for the first time that Chinese medicine monomers are effective inhibitors of bacterial nucleases. New drug research is currently mining traditional Chinese medicine to discover novel chemical agents to use against drug-resistant pathogens. Therefore, identification of new virulence factors, and screening their inhibitors from Chinese medicines, may ultimately result in the discovery of novel drugs available to treat TB.\n\nIn vivo infection experiments suggested that the rMS Rv0888NS/MS and Rv0888S/MS persisted in the lungs of mice infected at 17 d, and histopatholocical analysis revealed that the mouse lungs (7 d post-infection) developed obvious pathological changes, possibly indicating that Rv0888 may act as a virulence factor in M. tuberculosis and could relate to the persistence of M. tuberculosis in the host. Previous studies have reported different nuclease localizations in bacteria: secreted in the medium (S. pyogenes), membrane-associated (S. pneumoniae) and peptidoglycan-anchored (S. pyogenes, Streptococcus suis)183233. In M. tuberculosis, Rv0888 contains a signal peptide and is secreted into the medium14. This exported product could be more effective for M. tuberculosis pathogenecity than a membrane-associated nuclease like S. pneumoniae EndA, which would have limited access to its substrate34. The characterization of Rv0888 nuclease in this study will facilitate the understanding of the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis and might prompt identification of novel drugs to treat TB.\n\nThe mice used in this study were purchased from Vital River, Beijing, China. All experimental work involving animals was performed according to the guidelines recommended by the animal welfare and ethics of the Heilongjiang Animal Ethics Committee at the Heilongjiang science and technology government agency (Harbin, People\u2019s Republic of China) and was approved and supervised by the commissioner for animal welfare at the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute (HVRI) representing the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All the experiments were designed to minimize the numbers of animals used and every effort was made to minimize both pain and distress to the animals.\n\nM. smegmatis cultures were grown in Middlebrook 7H9 medium (BD Biosciences) and supplemented with 10% oleic acid/albumin/catalase enrichment (10% OADC, BD Biosciences), 0.05% Tween 80 (Amresco), and 0.2% glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich). E. coli DH5\u03b1 strain (Novagen) was used for plasmid preparations, and E. coli Rosetta 2 strain (Novagen) was used for protein expression. All E. coli strains were cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium.\n\nThe amino acid sequence of Rv0888 was checked for potential signal sequences using the SignalP 4.0 server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/). Primers (Supplementary Table S1) were designed to amplify the rv0888, rv0888NS, and rv0888S genes from genome of M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv. PrimeSTAR Max DNA polymerase (TaKaRa Bio) was used for PCR amplification. The rv0888 amplicon was cloned into a pET22b vector (Novagen) with a 6 \u00d7 His-tag at the C-terminal and the recombinant plasmid (pET-22b-Rv0888) was transformed into Rosetta 2 (DE3) E. coli. The Rv0888 protein was expressed as the inclusion-body form. The recombinant Rosetta 2 (DE3) E. coli was grown in LB medium (200 \u03bcg/mL ampicillin and 34 \u03bcg/mL chloromycetin) at 37 \u00b0C until OD600 = 0.6\u20131.0, and were then induced with 1 mM IPTG at 37 \u00b0C for 4 hours. The rv0888NS and rv0888S amplicons were cloned into a pMV262 vector (assembled in our laboratory, the corresponding sequence is shown in the supplementary data) and the recombinant plasmids (pMV262-Rv0888NS and pMV262-Rv0888S, respectively) were transformed into M. smegmatis mc2 155 cells. The rMS was grown in 7H9 medium (containing 0.05% Tween-80, 0.2% Glycerol, 10% OADC, 50 \u03bcg/mL kanamycin) at 37 \u00b0C until OD600 = 0.8\u20131.0. Protein expression was analyzed by SDS-PAGE.\n\nThe pET-22b-Rv0888 template plasmid was amplified with complementary mutagenic oligonucleotide pairs (Supplementary Table S2) to introduce N131A, E267A, G303A, H353A, D387A, N389A, D438A, D472A, H473A, D472A-H473A substitutions into the nucleotide sequence; PCR amplification was performed using the PrimeSTAR Max DNA Polymerase (TaKaRa Bio). The PCR products were digested with DpnI to damage the methylated parental template DNA and, the mutated plasmids were transformed into DH5\u03b1 E. coli. All of the substitutions were confirmed by DNA sequencing.\n\nStarting from a 4 L bacterial culture, cells were harvested by centrifugation and the pellet was resuspended in 200 mL of buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 8.0), and disrupted by a high pressure homogenizer (Constant system USA, 30 kpsi) at 4 \u00b0C. Inclusion bodies were isolated from the cell extract by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. The pellet was then washed with 80 mL buffer A, sonicated (350 W, 3 s/3 s, 4 \u00b0C) and collected by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. The pellet was suspended with 80 mL 2 M urea by stirring at 4 \u00b0C for 4 hours and then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C to collect the pellet. Inclusion bodies were solubilized by stirring at 4 \u00b0C overnight in 80 mL buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 6 M urea, 20% glycerol, pH 8.0). The dissolved protein was clarified from insoluble material by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C.\n\nThe supernatant was dialyzed against 2 L buffer C (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 5 M urea, 20% glycerol, pH 8.0) to 2 L buffer D (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, pH 8.0) (concentration of urea 5 M\u20130 M at intervals of 1 M, other conditions remained constant). The dialyzed protein was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was loaded onto a Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with 10 mL buffer A. Non-binding proteins were washed with 60 mL buffer E (20 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mM imidazole, pH 8.0), 60 mL buffer F (20 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 40 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) and 100 mL buffer G (20 mM Tris-HCl, 1 M NaCl, pH 8.0), and the target protein was eluted with 5 mL buffer H (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol 300 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) and 5 mL buffer I (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 500 mM imidazole, pH 8.0), sequentially. The collected proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.\n\nThe protein purified from affinity chromatography was centrifuged in a 30 kDa Centricon concentrator (Millipore) and concentrated to ~2 mL. The concentrated protein was loaded onto a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column (GE Healthcare) in buffer J (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and all peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The verified protein was concentrated again and loaded onto a Resource S 5 mL column (GE Healthcare), which was pre-equilibrated with buffer J. The target protein was eluted from the column with a linear gradient of NaCl concentration from 0 M to 2 M. Fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.\n\nThe purified protein was run on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and the lane containing the target protein was removed and cut into pieces of about 1 mm3. After washing three times with sterile water, the gel pieces were destained by three sequential 15-min treatments with 100 \u03bcL of 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Fluka) in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile (Fisher) at pH 8.0, and the pieces where then washed once more with sterile water. The gel slices were dehydrated with 30 \u03bcL 100% acetonitrile and completely dried with a Speed-Vac at room temperature. The samples were digested with 8 \u03bcL of 0.1 mg/mL trypsin (Promega) overnight at 37 \u00b0C. Then, 0.3 \u03bcL of the digested protein was mixed with 0.3 \u03bcL of matrix solution (5 mg/mL \u03b1-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic-acid (Fluka) in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile (Fisher) and 0.1% (w/v) trifluoroacetic acid (DIMA)) and spotted onto a sample plate for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis. Positive ion reflection mode was selected and the results were analyzed using 4000 Series software. The target protein was identified by comparing the peptide sequences against homologous proteins in the SwissProt databases using the following parameters: precursor tolerance, \u00b10.2 Da; MS/MS tolerance, \u00b10.8 Da; missed cleavages, 1.\n\nTo measure the substrate specificity for the recombinant Rv0888 nuclease, 0.2 \u03bcg of linear dsDNA (PCR amplified), circular plasmid DNA (pGEX-6p-1 vector), chromosomal DNA (E. coli DNA) or RNA from baker\u2019s yeast (Sigma-Aldrich) were incubated with 3 \u03bcg of the purified Rv0888 protein in 10 \u03bcL of reaction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM MgCl2, pH 7.5) at 37 \u00b0C. Buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5) served as a negative control for the Rv0888 protein. After 60 min, 10 \u03bcL of the reaction solution was mixed with 1 \u03bcL of 10 \u00d7 loading buffer and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.0% agarose gel. All assays were conducted in triplicate.\n\nDivalent cations are often required for DNases/nuclease activity35363733. The effects of divalent cations on nuclease activity were determined by incubating the enzyme (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5) with 5 mM of several divalent cation salts (CaCl2, MgCl2, MnCl2, BaCl2, NiCl2) and various combinations of divalent cation salts (CaCl2 + MgCl2, CaCl2 + MnCl2, MgCl2 + MnCl2) at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. The results were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.0% agarose gel. The assays were conducted in triplicate.\n\nThe effect of pH on Rv0888 activity was determined using optimal divalent cations over a pH range of 6.0\u20138.0 (at 0.5 intervals) in 20 mM Tris-HCl at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. The impact of temperature on Rv0888 activity was measured using the optimal divalent cations and the optimal pH over a temperature range of 33 \u00b0C\u201351 \u00b0C (at 2 \u00b0C intervals) for 1 h. All results were verified by electrophoresis on a 1.0% agarose gel. Rv0888 activity was quantified using a previously described spectrophotometric method38. For a 200 \u03bcL reaction mixture, 20 \u03bcL of 10 \u00d7 reaction buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM CaCl2, 50 mM MnCl2, pH 7.5), 20 \u03bcL of circular plasmid DNA (100 ng/\u03bcL pGEX-6p-1), 10 \u03bcL of Rv0888 protein (1 mg/mL), and 150 \u03bcL of sterilized water were combined. Next, after incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 1 hr, the reaction was stopped by adding 8 \u03bcL of 0.5 M EDTA. Then the reaction mixtures were diluted to 2 mL using sterilized water and were measured using a NanophotometerTM Peal Ultramicro UV-Vis spectrophotometer set at 260 nm. One enzymatic activity unit was defined as the amount of enzyme required to increase the absorbance by 0.001 A260 mL\u20131\u00b7min\u20131\u00b7cm\u20131 at 41 \u00b0C.\n\nMichaelis-Menton kinetic parameters of Rv0888 were measured using spectrophotometric assays with calf thymus DNA and baker\u2019s yeast RNA. To achieve this, 10 \u03bcg of purified Rv0888 protein was incubated at 41 \u00b0C with different substrates at varying concentrations (DNA: 0.00625 mg/mL, 0.0125 mg/mL, 0.025 mg/mL, 0.05 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL, 0.2 mg/mL, 0.4 mg/mL, 0.6 mg/mL, 0.8 mg/mL; RNA: 0.00625 mg/mL, 0.0125 mg/mL, 0.025 mg/mL, 0.05 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL) for 1 h. Rv0888 protein was substituted with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.5) as a negative control. After incubation, the reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of 5% ice-cold perchloic acid, followed by dilution to 2 mL with sterilized water. The diluted solutions were measured using a NanophotometerTM Peal Ultramicro UV-Vis spectrophotometer set at 260 nm. All assays were repeated three times.\n\nInhibition screening of purified Rv0888 was performed using the following Chinese medicine monomers: Salvianic acid A sodium, Salidroside, dissolved/sterilized Gastrodin and Leonurine; Rhoifolin, Corylifolinin, Cochinchinenin C, Yangonin, Gliquidone, Pterostilbene, Notopterol, Cichoric acid, Loureirin B, Rosiglitazone and Levoalkannim dissolved in 50% dimethyl sulfoxide; Mangostin, Harpagoside and Coniferyl ferulate dissolved in 50% methyl alcohol; Acteoside, Reynoutria japonica Houtt, Echinacoside, Diosmetin, Rutin, Phlorizin, Baicalin, Naringin, Myricetin, Silymarine, Osthole, Gambogic, Neogambogic acid, Rhein, Puerarin, Oleuropein, Chlorogenic acid, Eleutheroside B, 6-Gingerol, Crocin, Curcumin and Resveratrol dissolved in 50% ethanol. All Chinese medicine monomers were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 3 \u03bcg of purified Rv0888 was pre-incubated at 37 \u00b0C with each 0.3 mM of the different Chinese medicine monomers in a final volume of 10 \u03bcL. The controls were prepared by substituting the Chinese medicine monomers with sterilized water, 50% dimethyl sulfoxide, 50% methyl alcohol, or 50% ethanol. The remaining activity was determined as described above.\n\nIn this study, 5\u20136 week old female BALB/c mice (Vital River, Beijing) were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions and used for lung infection assays. The rMS strains (pMV262, Rv0888NS-pMV262 without its signal peptide, Rv0888S-pMV262 containing its signal peptide) were prepared in 7H9 medium, harvested at full log phase, and washed twice in 2 mL PBS before animal injection. Mice were randomly divided into 4 groups and anaesthetized with diethyl ether prior for bacterial administration. A total of 2 \u00d7 107 cfu of rMS strains (pMV262, Rv0888NS-pMV262, Rv0888S-pMV262) in 50 \u03bcL of PBS solution were nasally administered, using PBS as a negative control. At 4 h, 24 h, 4 d, 7 d, and 17 d post infection, 3 mice from each group were killed. Lungs were removed from the mice, with the entire left lobe of the lung homogenized with LB under aseptic conditions and then spread onto LB Agar plates containing 50 \u03bcg/mL kanamycin. The plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 3\u20134 days for counting bacteria. About one third of the right lobe of the lung was fixated with 10% formalin for pathological analysis.\n\nEach experiment was independently repeated three times. A two-tailed Student\u2019s t test was used to determine statistical significance, and Prism software (version 5.0; GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA) was used for these analyses. A P < 0.05 was considered significant (***P < 0.001).\n\nHow to cite this article: Dang, G. et al. Characterization of Rv0888, a Novel Extracellular Nuclease from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Sci.
