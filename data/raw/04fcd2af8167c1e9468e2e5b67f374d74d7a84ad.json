{"title": "Hydroxylated Sclerosporin Derivatives from the Marine-derived Fungus Cadophora malorum \u2020 NIH Public Access", "body": "1 H-1 H COSY data for 2 revealed a spin system ranging from H 2 -3 via H-1 and H-6 to H 2 -9 and to H 3 -12/H 3 -13, thus outlining major parts of the planar structure. Protons H 2 -15 showed a 1 H-1 H long range coupling to H-5, which together with an HMBC correlation from H 2 -15 to C-3 and from H-5 to C-6 completed the first ring of 2. HMBC correlations from H-9 to C-14 connected the carboxylic acid moiety with C-10, which in turn had to be bound to C-1 due to a HMBC correlation from H-1 to C-10 and to C-9. The planar structure of compound 2 was thus that of sclerosporin (1) hydroxylated at C-15.\n\nSclerosporin itself was also obtained during this study. The molecular formula of 1 was deduced by accurate mass measurement (HREIMS) to be C 15 H 22 O 2 . The final structure of 1 was identified as that of the known compound (+)-sclerosporin by comparing its NMR data and optical rotation with published values. 4, 5 The carbon skeleton of compounds 3 -5 and the position of the double bonds were also found to be identical to that of 1, as deduced from 1D and 2D NMR analyses. All compounds are thus cadinane type sesquiterpenes with a sclerosporin nucleus (see Table 1-Table 2 ) and differ merely concerning the site of hydroxylation.\n\nThe position of the hydroxy group in 3 and 4 was established making use of 1 H-1 H COSY and HMBC data. Thus, in 3 the 13 C NMR resonance signal for C-12 (\u03b4 64.9) was shifted downfield, and H-12 (\u03b4 3.52) showed coupling with H-11, placing the hydroxy substituent at C-12. The 13 C NMR spectrum of 4 exhibited a downfield shifted quaternary carbon (\u03b4 72.6, C-11) along with singlet proton resonances for the methyl groups CH 3 -12/CH 3 -13 in the 1 H NMR spectrum, thus the hydroxy substituent had to be placed at C-11. The 13 C NMR spectrum of 5 exhibited only two resonances for methylene groups (C-2, C-3) instead of three such moieties as in 2 -4. Instead of the methylene group CH 2 -8 in 2 -4, in 5 a methine group resonating at \u03b4 68.7 and \u03b4 4.13 in the 13 C and 1 H NMR spectra respectively was found. The 1 H-1 H COSY spectrum revealed correlations between H-8 and H-9 as well as H-7, positioning the hydroxy substituent in 5 at C-8. The planar structures of 2 -5 were thus established to be 15hydroxysclerosporin (2), 12-hydroxysclerosporin (3), 11-hydroxysclerosporin (4) and 8hydroxysclerosporin (5) .\n\nThe Cotton effect in the CD spectrum of (+)-sclerosporin (1) was similar to that reported in the literature, 7 confirming the absolute configuration of 1 to be that of (+)-sclerosporin (see Table 3 ). The absolute configurations of compounds 2 -5 were established by analyses of CD and NOESY spectra. The CD spectra of the hydroxylated compounds 2 -5 were closely similar to that of (+)-sclerosporin (1), thus the identical absolute configuration can be proposed for compounds 2 -4 (see Table 3 ). However, the configuration at position C-11 in 3 remains unresolved. Interestingly, 5 was the only one with a negative specific rotation (see Table 3 ). This change on specific rotation was most probably caused by the additional stereogenic center at C-8. The configuration at C-8 was established making use of NOESY correlations and 1 H-1 H coupling constants. A NOESY correlation between H-1 and H-6 is in agreement with the configuration of the other sclerosporin derivatives, and further correlations between H-8 and H-6, H-11, H 3 -12, H 3 -13 indicate these protons to be in the same spatial orientation. Furthermore, a 1 H-1 H coupling constant of 8.7 Hz between H-7 and H-8 indicated a trans-type spatial arrangement. Knowing the absolute configuration of H-1, H-6 and H-7 from CD spectroscopic data, we can thus assign the configuration of 5 to be 1R, 6S, 7R, 8S.\n\nWe propose the trivial names (+)-15-hydroxysclerosporin, (+)-12-hydroxysclerosporin, (+)-11-hydroxysclerosporin and (\u2212)-8-hydroxysclerosporin for compounds 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively.\n\nCompound 2 was evaluated in the protease elastase (HLE) inhibition assay (tested at 100 \u00b5M), in the cytotoxic activity assay against a panel of three cancer cell lines (NCI-H460, MCF7 and SF268, tested at 100 \u00b5M), in the protein kinases DYRK1A and CDK5 inhibition activity assay (tested at 10 mM), for inhibition of the viral HIV-1 and HIV-2 induced cytopathogenic effect in MT-4 cells (tested at 50 \u00b5g/mL), in the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) assay (tested at 100 \u00b5g/ mL), and in the antiplasmodial activity assay against Plasmodium berghei (tested at 25 \u00b5M), but did not show any activity. Compound 2 was further tested against a pannel of three respiratory viruses, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) assay, Flu A (H5N1) and Flu B (tested at 100 \u00b5g/mL in the three tests), bud did not show any significant activity. Compound 3 was evaluated against two influenza viruses, Flu A (H5N1) and Flu B (tested at 100 \u00b5g/mL), but did not show any activity. Compound 5 was evaluated against 3-T3-L1 murine adipocytes assay and showed weak inhibitory activity on fat-accumulation with an IC 50 of 212 \u00b5M for triglyceride accumulation inhibition along with an IC 50 cytotoxic effect value of 304 \u00b5M (see Supp. Inf.).\n\nAll compounds were tested for sporogenic activity (concentrations from 0.005 \u00b5g/mL to 5 \u00b5g/ mL in BMS-agar plates) but the results were inconclusive, i.e. sporogenesis activity was observed but not with direct correlation with increasing quantity, probably due to compound stability problems. All compounds were evaluated in antibacterial (Escherichia coli, Bacillus megaterium), antifungal (Mycotypha microspora, Eurotium rubrum, and Microbotryum violaceum), and antialgal (Chlorella fusca) assays but did not showed any activity at a dose of 50 \u00b5g/disc.\n\nOptical rotations were measured on a Jasco DIP 140 polarimeter. UV and IR spectra were obtained employing Perkin-Elmer Lambda 40 and Perkin-Elmer Spectrum BX instruments, respectively. CD spectra were recorded in MeOH at room temperature using a JASCO J-810-150S spectropolarimeter. All NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl 3 or (CD 3 ) 2 CO employing a Bruker Avance 300 DPX spectrometer. Spectra were referenced to residual solvent signals with resonances at \u03b4 H/C 7.26/77.0 for CDCl 3 and \u03b4 H/C 2.04/29.8 for (CD 3 ) 2 CO. HREIMS were recorded on a Finnigan MAT 95 spectrometer. ESIMS measurements were recorded employing an API 2000, Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex. HPLC was carried out using a system composed of a Waters 515 pump together with a Knauer K-2300 differential refractometer. HPLC columns were from Knauer (250 \u00d7 8 mm, 5 \u00b5m, Eurospher-100 Si), flow rate 2 mL/min. Merck silica gel 60 (0.040-0.063 mm, 70-230 mesh) was used for vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC). Columns were wet-packed under vacuum using petroleum ether (PE). Before applying the sample solution, the columns were equilibrated with the first designated eluent. Standard columns for crude extract fractionation had dimensions of 13 \u00d7 4 cm.\n\nThe marine-derived fungus Cadophora malorum (Kidd & Beaumont) W. Gams was isolated from the green alga Enteromorpha sp. and identified by P. Massart and C. Decock, BCCM/ MUCL, Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium.
