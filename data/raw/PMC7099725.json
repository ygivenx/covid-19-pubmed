{"title": "Survivability, Partitioning, and Recovery of Enveloped Viruses in\nUntreated Municipal Wastewater", "body": "Recent severe disease outbreaks caused by enveloped viruses, such as Ebola,\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome\n(MERS), and avian influenza H5N1 have heightened fears of an imminent deadly\nviral pandemic. The major transmission routes of these viruses involved\ndirect person-to-person contact or indirect contact with contaminated\nobjects.1,2 Human enveloped viruses are often presumed to exist\nin low concentrations in human excrement and undergo rapid inactivation in\naqueous environments; however, several lines of evidence suggest these\nassumptions are not always correct. The genes of coronaviruses and avian\ninfluenzas have been detected in the feces of infected\nindividuals,3\u22129 and\nsome enveloped viruses were measured in wastewater biosolid\nresiduals.10 Likewise, some enveloped viruses can\nsurvive for days to weeks in pasteurized wastewater.11\u221213 A review of virus\nT90 values (i.e., time to reach 90% inactivation) suggests\nthat avian influenza viruses survive just as long, if not longer, than\nnonenveloped enteric viruses in some aqueous environments.14 Based on this information, it is therefore feasible that\nsewage and fecal-contaminated water could serve as vectors for certain\nenveloped viruses. Indeed, a SARS coronavirus outbreak in an apartment\ncomplex in Hong Kong was attributed to the transport of viruses in\nwastewater to the air ducts.15\n\nThe vast majority of studies on the presence and fate of viruses in human waste\nand municipal wastewater have focused on nonenveloped enteric viruses (e.g.,\nadenoviruses, polioviruses, enteroviruses, noroviruses and\nrotaviruses).16\u221221\nThese viruses replicate in human gut tissues and transmit diseases primarily\nvia the fecal-oral route. Due to the major role of water and food in the\ntransmission of enteric viruses, there are a number of established methods\nfor nonenveloped enteric virus detection in complex environmental matrices.\nEnveloped viruses differ structurally from nonenveloped viruses due to the\npresence of a lipid bilayer membrane outside the viral protein capsid, which\ncontains proteins or glycoproteins. The different functional groups on the\nouter surface of enveloped viruses compared to nonenveloped viruses likely\nimpact their survival and partitioning behavior in aqueous\nenvironments.22\u221224 Likewise, methods to concentrate and recover\nnonenveloped enteric viruses from wastewater and other environmental\nmatrices may not be suitable for enveloped viruses. For example, lipid\nlayers are sensitive to the detergents and organic\nsolvents25,26 that are commonly used to extract and purify\nnonenveloped enteric viruses.\n\nTo address the paucity of data on the fate and recovery of enveloped viruses in\nwastewater matrices, we studied the survival and partitioning behavior of\nthe human enveloped virus surrogates, murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and\nPseudomonas phage \u03d56, in pasteurized and\nunpasteurized wastewater. We compared the inactivation kinetics and\nliquid\u2013solid partitioning of the two enveloped viruses with two\nnonenveloped virus surrogates, Enterobacteria phage MS2 and\nT3. Furthermore, we systematically tested the effectiveness of three virus\nrecovery methods\u2013initially developed for using on enteric\nviruses\u2013for extracting and concentrating enveloped viruses from both\nliquid and solid fractions in wastewater. Finally, we proposed an optimized\nultrafiltration method for detecting both enveloped and nonenveloped\nviruses.\n\nWastewater samples were collected from the Ann Arbor Wastewater Treatment\nplant, an activated sludge treatment plant serving roughly\n115 000 people with an average flow rate of 19 million gallons\nper day (MGD). Grab samples were collected after wastewater\nequalization, screening, and grit removal chambers, and just before\nthe primary settling tanks. All samples were collected and sealed in\nsterile plastic bottles and then immediately transported on ice to\nlaboratories at the University of Michigan where they were stored at 4\n\u00b0C and analyzed within 24 h. Wastewater pH, total suspended\nsolids (TSS), volatile suspended solids (VSS), and total chemical\noxygen demand (COD) were measured with standard methods.27\n\nWe chose to study MHV strain A59 and Pseudomonas phage\n\u03d56 because they are common surrogates for human enveloped\nviruses (Table 1).11,13,28 We also\nstudied two nonenveloped Enterobacteria phages MS2\nand T3 to allow for direct comparisons between enveloped and\nnonenveloped virus inactivation, partitioning, and\nrecovery.29\u221231\n\nMHV strain A59, and its supporting cell lines L2 and DBT, were kindly\nprovided by Dr. Leibowitz\u2019s lab at Texas A&M Health Science\nCenter College of Medicine. L2 and DBT cells were grown in\nDulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% newborn calf\nserum, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and\nincubated at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. MHV stocks were\npropagated in DBT and titered by plaque assay on L2 according to a\npublished protocol.32 After amplification, MHV\nstocks were centrifuged at 3000g for 10 min, and then\nfiltered through a 0.22 \u03bcm poly(ether sulfone) (PES) membrane\n(Millipore, USA), in order to remove cell debris and aggregated\nviruses. The MHV stocks (\u223c106 PFU\nmL\u20131) were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.\n\n\u03d56 and its bacterial host Pseudomonas syringae\nwere kindly provided by Dr. Linsey Marr\u2019s lab at Virginia Tech.\nP. syringae was grown in Luria\u2013Bertani\n(LB) medium containing 5 g L\u20131 NaCl at 26 \u00b0C.\nTo propagate \u03d56 stocks, soft LB-agar (0.7% agar) layers were\nremoved from the double-layer plates, and dissolved in 3 mL of LB\nmedium.33 The recovered viruses were purified\nwith centrifugation at 3000g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C\nand filtration through 0.22 \u03bcm PES membranes. The \u03d56\nstocks (\u223c1010 PFU mL\u20131) were\nstored at 4 \u00b0C.\n\nMS2 (ATCC 15597-B1) and T3 (recovered from ATCC 11303-B4), and their\ncorresponding Escherichia coli hosts ATCC 15597 and\nATCC 11303, respectively, were purchased from American Type Culture\nCollection (ATCC). The MS2 and T3 were propagated and assayed in their\nE. coli hosts based on published\nmethods.34,35 The viruses were purified\nwith an Econo Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography system (Bio-Rad)\nequipped with a HiPrep Sephacryl S-400 HR column (GE). The collected\nviral fraction was concentrated with 100 kDa Amicon ultracentrifugal\nfilters (Millipore), and filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm PES membrane\nfilter. The final MS2 and T3 stocks (\u223c1011 PFU\nmL\u20131) were stored in phosphate buffer (5 mM\nNaH2PO4 and 10 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) at 4\n\u00b0C.\n\nVirus surrogates were spiked into 30 mL samples of unpasteurized and\npasteurized wastewater to final concentrations of 3 \u00d7\n104 PFU mL\u20131 for MHV and 5\u20138\n\u00d7 105 PFU mL\u20131 for \u03d56, MS2 and\nT3; the lower MHV concentrations were due to the lower MHV stock\nconcentrations. Wastewater was pasteurized by heating to 70 \u00b0C\nfor 3 h; this treatment is consistent with previous studies involving\nenveloped virus survival in pasteurized\nwastewater.11,13 Wastewater samples were\nquickly mixed after viruses were added, titered for the initial virus\nconcentrations, and then incubated at 25 or 10 \u00b0C to mimic\ntypical summer and winter wastewater temperatures. Aliquots of\nwastewater were removed at specific incubation times and infective\nvirus concentrations were enumerated with plaque assays. The\nwastewater samples were diluted at least 10-fold to minimize\nwastewater effects on the host cells. Replicate experiments\n(n = 3) were conducted in wastewater samples\ncollected on different days to incorporate potential impacts of\nwastewater variation on virus survivability.\n\nTo evaluate the kinetics and extent of virus sorption to wastewater\nsolids, the virus surrogates were spiked into 30 mL samples of\nuntreated wastewater and wastewater with solids removed via\ncentrifugation at 30 000g for 10 min. (i.e.,\nsolids-removed samples). This centrifugation treatment, which was\npreviously shown to remove solids less than 0.3 \u03bcm in\ndiameter,36 consistently removed\n85\u201395% of the TSS in our wastewater samples (SI Table S2). Samples were spiked to achieve final\nvirus concentrations of 5 \u00d7 104 PFU\nmL\u20131 for MHV, and 6\u20138 \u00d7\n105 PFU mL\u20131 for \u03d56, MS2, and\nT3\u2013these were low enough to be feasible concentrations present\nin wastewater (<106 PFU mL\u20131) and high\nenough that more than 99% loss could be quantified with plaque assays.\nThe spiked samples were stirred and then incubated at 4 \u00b0C; this\ntemperature is at the low-end of mean municipal wastewater\ntemperatures in the U.S. (3\u201327 \u00b0C)37\nand was selected to minimize virus inactivation through the duration\nof the experiment. At various incubation times, aliquots of the\nuntreated and solids-removed samples were centrifuged at\n30 000g for 10 min, and the centrates\nwere assayed for infective viruses.\n\nVirus inactivation and sorption kinetics in wastewater batch reactors\nwere analyzed with an approach proposed by Grant et al. that accounts\nfor virus sorption and desorption from sorbents, as well as\ninactivation in the liquid and solid fractions.38\nIn our system, the solids-containing samples were the untreated\nwastewater influent and the solids-free samples were wastewater\nsamples with solids removed via centrifugation. Virus inactivation in\nthe wastewater liquid was assumed to be equal to virus inactivation in\nthe solids-removed sample, and to follow first-order\nkinetics:1where, Cl* is the nondimensional concentration of infective\nviruses measured in the solids-removed wastewater samples\n(Cl/Cl,0),\nt is the incubation time in hours, and k1\n(h\u20131) is the first-order virus inactivation\nconstant in the solids-removed wastewater.\n\nIn a wastewater sample spiked with viruses, the nondimensional\nconcentration of infective viruses in the wastewater liquid\nCl,ww* is\nrelated to the fraction of viruses inactivated in the liquid phase\n(\u03be1*), and the fraction reversibly adsorbed to wastewater solids\n(\u03be2*):2\n\nThe change of the viral fraction in the liquid and solid phases with time\ncan be described with the following set of differential\nequations:3a3b3cwhere, \u03be3* is the\nfraction of viruses inactivated on the solid surface; \u03c4 is the\nnondimensional time, equal to\nk1t;\nnsro* is the initial amount of viruses\nreversibly adsorbed to solids (assumed zero in the study);\nNb =\nk2/k1,\nwhere k2 (h\u20131) is the\nrate constant for reversible virus adsorption;\nNs =\n(k3+k4)/k3,\nwhere k3 (h\u20131) is the\nrate constant for virus inactivation at the solid surface and\nk4 (h\u20131) is the\nrate constant for the conversion of reversibly adsorbed viruses to an\nirreversibly adsorbed state;\nNi =\nk3/k1;\nNf =\n[(k2W/k\u20132V)+1],\nwhere k\u20132 (g L\u20131\nh\u20131) is the rate constant for virus desorption\nfrom solid phase to liquid phase, W (g) is the mass\nof solids, and V (L) is the liquid volume. At time\nzero (\u03c4 = 0), \u03be1* = \u03be2* = \u03be3* = 0.\n\nThe relationship between Cl,ww*\nand incubation time t was solved from numerical simulations of the\nabove differential equation system with the fourth order\nRunge\u2013Kutta algorithm in MATLAB2015. An extensive description\nof the equation derivations, simplifications, and parameter\ncalculations can be found in ref (38).\n\nFollowing incubation with the spiked viruses, wastewater samples\n(250 mL) were centrifuged at 2500g for 5 min at\n4 \u00b0C to remove large solids. The centrate was collected and\nmixed with 8% (w/v) of PEG 8000 and 0.5 M of NaCl. The mixture\nwas incubated for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C, and then centrifuged at\n10 000g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C.\nThe PEG pellet was resuspended in 2.5 mL phosphate buffered\nsaline (PBS, pH 7.4; Life Technologies) and assayed for\ninfective viruses.\n\nFollowing incubation with the viruses, wastewater samples (60 mL)\nwere centrifuged at 100 000g for 1 h at\n4 \u00b0C using a Sorvall WX Ultra centrifuge (Thermo\nScientific, Germany; SureSpin 630 (36 mL) rotor, P/N 79368;\nSureSpin swinging bucket, P/N 79388). The pellet was resuspened\nin 8 mL of 0.25 M glycine buffer (pH 9.5) and allowed to sit on\nice for 30 min. After neutralizing the solution pH with 16 mL\nPBS, the solids were removed by centrifugation at\n10 000g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C.\nThe supernatant was collected and centrifuged again at\n100 000g for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C to\npellet the viruses. The final virus pellet was dissolved in 600\n\u03bcL PBS.\n\nFollowing incubation with the spiked viruses, solids in the\nwastewater samples (250 mL) were removed by either centrifuging\nat 30 000g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C, or\nby centrifugation at 2500g for 5 min at 4\n\u00b0C followed by filtration through 0.22 \u03bcm PES\nmembrane filters. After the large solids had been removed, the\nsamples were concentrated with Centricon centrifugal filters\n(Millipore) to a final volume of 2.5 mL. Recoveries from\ncentrifugal filters with 10 kDa and 100 kDa cut-offs were\ncompared. Centrifugal filter reuse was tested by first washing\nused filters with 100 mL of 0.5 M NaOH and then storing the\nregenerated filters in 70% ethanol. The reused filters were\nrinsed with 100 mL of Milli-Q water prior to use.\n\nIn an attempt to recover viruses associated with wastewater solids,\nthe solids collected in the centrifugation step prior to\nultrafiltration were mixed with different elution buffers,\nincluding PBS, 0.05 M glycine buffer (pH 8.5), 0.05 M glycine\nbuffer (pH 9.5), 0.05 M glycine buffer (pH 10.5), 3% beef\nextract (pH 7.5), 3% beef extract (pH 9.5), and 3% beef extract\nwith 0.5 M sodium chloride (pH 9.5). Suspensions were set on ice\nfor 30 min and gently shaken every 10 min. The solutions were\ncentrifuged at 10 000g for 15 min at 4\n\u00b0C and the resulting centrate was neutralized with PBS (pH\n7.4), and then titered for infective viruses.\n\nNonparametric t tests were applied to two groups of\nexperimental data to assess statistical significance. Two-tailed\nP values were calculated, and\nP < 0.05 was considered statistically\nsignificant.\n\nInactivation of the two enveloped viruses (MHV and \u03d56) and\nnonenveloped virus MS2 in unpasteurized and pasteurized wastewater at\n10 and 25 \u00b0C followed first-order kinetics (Figure 1; SI Table S3), with inactivation proceeding faster\nfor the enveloped viruses. In unpasteurized wastewater at 25 \u00b0C,\nthe T90 (\u00b1SD) values for MHV and \u03d56 were 13\n(\u00b11) and 7 (\u00b10.4) hours, respectively, and 121 (\u00b136)\nhours for MS2 (SI Table S3). The nonenveloped T3 virus survived\nmuch longer than the other virus surrogates with no significant\ndecrease in infectivity observed within the 48 h experiments for both\ntemperatures (Figure 1). This\nis consistent with long survival times reported for tailed phages in\nadverse conditions.45 The inactivation kinetics of\nthe enveloped viruses were significantly (P <\n0.0001) slower in wastewater at 10 \u00b0C compared to 25 \u00b0C\n(SI Figure S4), with T90 (\u00b1SD) values\nof 36 (\u00b15) and 28 (\u00b12) hours for MHV and \u03d56 at 10\n\u00b0C, respectively (SI Table S3). Like T3, MS2 inactivation was not\nstatistically different at the two temperatures (P =\n0.1813) within the tested time scale (SI Figure S4).\n\nInactivation kinetics of the enveloped viruses MHV, \u03d56, and\nEbolavirus in pasteurized or gamma-irradiated wastewater have been\nreported previously.11\u221213 In our experiments, the two enveloped viruses\nlost infectivity at a significantly slower rate in pasteurized\nwastewater compared to unpasteurized wastewater, except for the case\nof MHV at 25 \u00b0C (Figure 1; SI Table S3). The most pronounced effect occurred\nwith \u03d56, which had a first-order inactivation rate constant\n(\u00b1SD) of 0.317 (\u00b10.022) h\u20131 in\nunpasteurized wastewater and 0.044 (\u00b10.004) h\u20131\nin pasteurized wastewater at 25 \u00b0C. A statistically significant\ndifference in the inactivation kinetics of the nonenveloped viruses\nwas not observed in pasteurized wastewater and unpasteurized\nwastewater; this may be due to the fact that our experiments were\nstopped before 90% of the nonenveloped viruses were inactivated.\nDiscrepancies in inactivation kinetics in sterilized and nonsterilized\nwastewater have been reported previously for nonenveloped\nviruses,46 and may be due to bacterial\nextracellular enzyme activity and protozoan or metazoan\npredation.47,48 Overall, the results suggest\nthat unpasteurized wastewater samples should be employed for\nsurvivability tests when feasible.\n\nWastewater residence times in sewage systems are typically less than 24\nh. Although \u03d56 and MHV had T90 values of 7\u201313\nh in unpasteurized wastewater at 25 \u00b0C, the T90 values\nincrease to 28\u201336 h at 10 \u00b0C. Human enveloped viruses\nexcreted in feces may therefore reach wastewater treatment plants in\nan infective state, especially in cool climates. Local outbreaks and\nglobal pandemics of enveloped viruses excreted in feces or urine are\ntherefore relevant for wastewater utilities.\n\nThe measured concentrations of infective MHV and \u03d56 in the\nsolids-removed wastewater samples immediately after spiking, mixing,\nand centrifuging, were consistently lower than the theoretical\nconcentrations based on the amount of viruses spiked into the sample\n(SI Figure S1). Approximately 47% of the spiked MHV\nand 77% of the spiked \u03d56 were recovered in the centrate of the\nsolids-removed wastewater. This is compared to a nearly 100% recovery\nof the nonenveloped viruses MS2 and T3. Nearly all of the MHV was\nrecovered when it was spiked into PBS and centrifuged in the same\nmanner (SI Figure S1). This suggests that a fraction of the\nenveloped viruses (53% MHV and 23% \u03d56) were rapidly inactivated\nin the solids-removed wastewater. A pronounced initial decrease in\ninfective virus concentration was previously observed when Ebola virus\nwas added to pasteurized wastewater.12 In those\nexperiments, the number of infective Ebola viruses decreased rapidly\nover the first 24 h (\u223c2-log loss) and then stabilized at a much\nslower inactivation rate over the subsequent 7 days. Similar biphasic\ninactivation kinetics have also been observed with nonenveloped\nviruses, which were attributed to subpopulations of viruses with\nvaried susceptibilities to solution chemistry or temperature.38 In our partitioning experiments, we chose to\nnormalize measured concentrations in the wastewater and solids-removed\nwastewater samples over time to concentrations measured in\nsolids-removed samples immediately after they were spiked with\nviruses, mixed, and centrifuged. We felt this approach was justified\nbecause the behaviors of the persistent subpopulations are of most\ninterest for real wastewater systems.\n\nMHV, \u03d56, and MS2 concentrations decreased significantly over a\nthree-day period in the solids-removed wastewater samples (Figure 2) and the resulting\nrate constants were assumed to equal virus inactivation rates in the\nliquid fraction of wastewater (eq 1, k1).38\nWhen the viruses were spiked in wastewater samples containing solids,\nthe normalized MHV and \u03d56 concentrations in the wastewater\nliquid phase (in centrate after centrifugation) decreased rapidly in\nthe first hour, and then eventually decreased at the same rate as\nvirus inactivation in the solids-removed sample (Figure 2). The MS2 concentration in the\nwastewater liquid phase decreased rapidly at first, and then slowed to\na rate that was faster than MS2 inactivation in the solids-removed\nsample (Figure 2). No\nsignificant decay of T3 was observed in the solids-removed wastewater\nsamples or the liquid phase of wastewater samples.\n\nBased on these results, the MHV and \u03d56 sorption kinetics can be\nbest described by a noninstantaneous quasi-equilibrium adsorption\nmodel in which the virus sorption to wastewater solids does not occur\ninstantaneously and the inactivation rates in the wastewater solid and\nliquid phases are equal (SI Table S4). A similar model was used to describe\nbacteriophage \u03bb sorption kinetics with sand.38 In comparison, MS2 behavior is best described by the\nnoninstantaneous quasi-equilibrium adsorption and surface sink model.\nIn this model, virus inactivation is faster in the solid phase than in\nthe liquid phase (SI Table S4); a similar model was proposed for the\ninteraction of bacteriophage MS2 and PRD1 with sediments.49 Bacteriophage T3 could not be modeled due to the\nnonsignificant decreases in infective viruses measured over the\nexperiment time scale.\n\nThese models predict that 26% of MHV, 22% of \u03d56, and 6% of MS2\nadsorbed to wastewater solids at equilibrium (Figure\n3; SI Table S4). Although the T3 virus kinetics could\nnot be modeled, < 5% of the spiked T3 had partitioned to the\nwastewater solids at the end of the 36 h experiment; this suggests\nthat like MS2, T3 partitions overwhelmingly to the liquid fraction of\nwastewater (Figure 2). The\nequilibrium percentages reported here are not representative for all\nwastewaters because wastewater solids concentrations vary widely. It\nshould be noted that our wastewater solid concentrations were typical\nfor medium-strength municipal wastewaters37\n(SI Table S1) with an average TSS value of 235 mg\nL\u20131.\n\nThe partitioning results for MS2 and T3 are consistent with an early\nobservation that wastewater solids are poor at absorbing enteric\nviruses.50 Wastewater solids tend to be\nnegatively charged, as is MS2 (isoelectric point = 3.9). The\nisoelectric point for T3 has not been reported, but the similar T2 and\nT4 viruses have isoelectric points <6.51 A study\non the adsorption of four nonenveloped viruses to various solid\nsurfaces demonstrated that long-ranged electrostatic interactions and\nhydrophobic effects between the virus capsid proteins and the sorbent\nsurfaces dictated adsorption, with short-ranged van der Waals and\nsteric interactions playing less important roles.52\nSimilar work has not been conducted for enveloped viruses, and the\nimpact that the surface phospholipids and various membrane proteins\nhave on partitioning remains elusive.\n\nDespite the poor sorption of nonenveloped enteric viruses to wastewater\nsolids, some enteric viruses have been observed in primary settled\nsolids in high concentrations.36,53 In such cases, the\nviruses were likely released into wastewater within or strongly\nassociated with fecal solids and never reached equilibrium between the\nliquid and solid fractions. When excreted in watery diarrhea or urine,\nthe viruses would more likely reach equilibrium. Our results suggest\nthat if allowed to reach equilibrium, enveloped viruses more strongly\nassociate with wastewater solids than nonenveloped viruses.\nConsequently, enveloped viruses would be removed to a greater extent\nthan nonenveloped viruses in primary wastewater treatment. More\nenveloped and nonenveloped viruses will need to be tested to confirm\nthe results obtained with the two enveloped and two nonenveloped model\nviruses.\n\nIn addition to relaying information on virus partitioning between solid\nand liquid phases at equilibrium, the models also predicted the amount\nof time it takes for the viruses to reach equilibrium. This\ninformation is important for virus recovery experiments, where viruses\nare spiked into an environmental sample and then extracted and\nquantified with various techniques. If the spiked viruses are\nextracted too soon, results may be biased due to the spiked viruses in\nliquid phase. In water with soils and clays, nonenveloped virus\nadsorption is assumed to reach equilibrium within an hour.54 Our models estimated that the viruses in\nwastewater reached 90% of equilibrium concentrations after\n0.3\u20131.5 h, and 99% of equilibrium concentrations after\n0.4\u20132.9 h (Figure 3;\nSI Table S4). Based on these results, we allowed\nsamples to equilibrate for at least 1 h before extraction methods were\ntested.\n\nAccording to the simulation results of virus partitioning, greater than\n70% of the infective model enveloped viruses were associated with\nwastewater liquids at equilibrium. We therefore focused primarily on\nthe wastewater liquid fraction in our virus recovery experiments. Of\nthe three methods we tested, the ultrafiltration method and the PEG\nprecipitation methods involved an initial step to remove wastewater\nsolids and then focused on recovering the viruses in the liquid phase.\nUltracentrifugation method, on the other hand, involved pelleting all\nof the wastewater solids and colloids and then extracting the viruses\nfrom the pellet.\n\nThe enveloped MHV recoveries were consistently lower than the\nnonenveloped MS2 recoveries when the PEG precipitation and\nultrafiltration methods were applied (Figure 4); this was not unexpected given that\nMHV partitioned to solids to a greater extent than the MS2. Low mean\nrecoveries (<6%) were achieved for both MS2 and MHV with the\nultracentrifugation method (Figure 4). The ultrafiltration method resulted in significantly\nhigher MHV recoveries than the PEG precipitation (P =\n0.0065) and the ultracentrifugation (P = 0.0084)\nmethods. MS2 recoveries with the ultrafiltration method were\nsignificantly higher than ultracentrifugation (p = 0.0074), but not\nsignificantly different than PEG precipitation (P =\n0.4137) method (Figure 4).\n\nAdditional experiments suggested that incubation with PEG caused a major\ndrop in infective MHV. The T90 for MHV in wastewater with\nPEG was 16 h compared to 40 h in wastewater without PEG (SI Figure S2). The enveloped influenza viruses were\npreviously recovered from surface waters with the PEG method,55 but recoveries were very low (0.2%\u20130.6%).\nThe low recoveries for MHV and influenza with PEG may be due to\ndisruption of their lipid bilayers.56 Meanwhile,\nthe MS2 recovery obtained here with the PEG method (43.1 \u00b1 16.8%)\nwas comparable to the recovery of nonenveloped\nEchovirus 7 from raw wastewater (78.5 \u00b1\n11.0%).57 These results suggest that PEG\nprecipitation method, which is effective at recovering infective\nnonenveloped viruses from water samples, is not optimal for recovering\ninfective enveloped viruses.\n\nIn the ultracentrifugation method, the initial centrifugation\n(100 000g for 1 h) step did not\neffectively pellet bacteriophage MS2, and 63% of the spiked MS2 was\ndetected in the centrate. Comparatively, only 1% of the spiked MHV was\ndetected in the centrate. Previously, the ultracentrifugation method\nwas successful at recovering rotavirus genes from raw wastewater (47%\nmean recovery), but the infectivity state of the recovered viruses was\nnot tested.19 Our low recovery of infective MHV\nviruses in the pellet may be due to virus inactivation by the large\nultracentrifuge forces.58 Taken together, this\nsuggests that pelleting wastewater solids with ultracentrifugation may\nbe effective at recovering enveloped viruses genes for qPCR detection,\nbut not appropriate when infective viruses are desired.\n\nAdditional experiments were conducted to optimize recoveries with the\nultrafiltration method (description in SI Figure S3). The optimized method involves\nprefiltering 250 mL of wastewater through a 0.22 \u03bcm PES membrane\nto remove solids, followed by concentration of the filtrate with 10\nkDa centrifugal filters to a final volume of 2.5 mL. Using this\nmethod, we achieved mean virus recoveries of 25.1% for MHV, 18.2% for\n\u03d56, 55.6% for MS2, and 85.5% for T3 (Figure\n4). Ultrafiltration has been\nsuccessfully applied for recovering nonenveloped enteric viruses from\nwastewater, such as polioviruses, adenoviruses, noroviruses, and\nenteroviruses.18,41 Here, we have demonstrated\nthat the method can also be optimized for recovering enveloped\nviruses. In future work, we will test hollow fiber ultrafilters and\ntangential flow ultrafiltration to potentially increase wastewater\nsample volumes that can be processed, and thus decrease the detection\nlimits of infective enveloped viruses in wastewater.\n\nOur results shed light on the behavior of enveloped viruses in wastewater\nand provide guidance on how to recover infective enveloped viruses\nfrom raw wastewater. Although the two model enveloped viruses were\nmore rapidly inactivated in wastewater, they did survive long enough\nto be of concern for wastewater treatment facilities, stormwater\noverflow events, and wastewater intrusion in drinking water. The\nresults presented here will be particularly important during potential\nfuture avian influenza or coronavirus outbreaks in humans, as some\nstrains of these viruses can be excreted in feces. Future work should\nexamine additional enveloped viruses to elucidate the specific virus\ncharacteristics that contribute to their survival times and enhanced\npartitioning to solids."}
