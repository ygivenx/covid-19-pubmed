This supported speculation of possible decline in severity with the advent of 28 warmer spring and summer temperatures in north-temperate latitudes (Sajadi et al., 29 2020; Wang et al., 2020) , comparable to many viruses affecting human respiratory systems, 30 including SARS (Tan et al., 2005; Gaunt et al., 2010) . 31\n\nHowever, recent (updated up to March 26, 2020; cf. Methods) data revealed the 32 spread of the epidemic across territories experiencing warm temperatures in the tropics (e.g. 33\n\nIndonesia, Singapore, Brazil) and southern hemisphere as well (e.g. Australia, Argentina). 34\n\nThe current distribution of the epidemic challenges, therefore, the inference that SARS-CoV-35 2 may behave as a seasonal respiratory virus based on previous statistical analyses from 36 earlier realized distributions. 37\n\nHere we examine the relationship between the apparent exponential rate of SARS-38 The number of COVID-19 incidences follows the expected exponential growth, 57 although rates are only robust when cases exceed 100 persons for any country or province. 58\n\nHence, we fitted the exponential model to each country and each province of China. We 59 calculated exponential rate parameters for the countries where the COVID-19 incident has at 60 least a 10-day growth period, and the total number of cases was at least 100. 61\n\nWhere N is the cumulative number of diagnosed persons and Days is the number of days and 64 \u07db is the exponential rate (100 x \u07db = % increase per day). 65\n\nTo calculate the effect of temperature on the exponential rate parameter, we first 67 regressed the exponential rate parameters retrieved from the exponential model on \u0736 \u0741 \u0749 \u202b\u202c and 68\n\nIf the squared term is significant, it provides evidence of nonlinearity. 70\n\nThe thermal performance of COVID-19 was characterized by fitting spread rate estimate or 71 growth parameter (\u07db) and temperature to the Gaussian function; 72\n\n.

The broad variability in realized \u07db and R0 between 101 nations (global) and provinces (China) largely reflects differences in detection likelihood 102 along with the timing and rigour of adoption of confinement measures. 103\n\nThe relationship between \u07db and R0 and T avg shows no evidence for a reduced spread 104 rate with warming (Figure 1 and R0 for T avg > 20 o C ( Figure S2 ). Our updated results (Figure 1) show, however, that 110 this apparent temperature-dependence was confounded with a prevailing zonal pattern of 111 spread across the north-temperate zone, possibly reflecting the main patterns of human 112 mobility, which delayed arrival of the epidemics to the southern hemisphere and the tropics. 113\n\nThese results suggest that, contrary to prior assessments, the spread rate of the 115 COVID-19 pandemic is temperature-independent, suggesting that there is little hope for relief 116 as temperatures in the northern hemisphere increase, and that poor nations with weak health 117 systems in tropical regions, such as African, are at great risk. 118\n\nData sources: The data on COVID-19 is available publicly across many sources; where 119 downloadable data files are updated daily few are listed below; 120\n\nWorld health organization (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-121 2019/situation-reports/) 122 123\n\nJohns Hopkins CSSE (https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases) 124 .
