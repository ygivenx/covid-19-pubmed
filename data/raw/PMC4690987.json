{"title": "Synthesis, Binding\nand Antiviral Properties of Potent\nCore-Extended Naphthalene Diimides Targeting the HIV-1 Long\nTerminal Repeat Promoter G-Quadruplexes", "body": "G-quadruplexes (G4s)\nare nucleic acids secondary structures that\nmay form in single-stranded G-rich sequences under physiological conditions.1\u22123 Four Gs bind via Hoogsteen-type hydrogen bonds base-pairing to yield\nG-quartets, which in turn stack on top of each other to form the G4.\nG4 structures may significantly vary, both in terms of strand stoichiometry\n(forming both inter- and intramolecular structures) and strand orientation/topology.\nThe presence of K+ cations specifically supports G4 formation\nand stability.4\u22126 In the human genome and in prokaryotes, G4 DNA motifs\nhave been found in telomeres, G-rich micro- and mini-satellites, near\noncogene promoters, and within the rDNA.7\u221212 Human G4 DNA motifs have been reported to be associated with recombination\nprone regions13 and to show mutational\npatterns that preserve the potential to form G4 DNA structures.9 Misregulation of these G4 structures has been\nassociated with relevant human neurological disorders.14\u221218 The identification of G4 binding proteins19 and their visualization in cells with antibody-based technology20,21 have also provided convincing evidence of the existence of cellular\nG4s in vivo.\n\nRecently, the presence of G4s in viruses and their\ninvolvement\nin virus key steps has also been provided.22 G4s have been implicated in pathogenic mechanisms of the Epstein\u2013Barr\nvirus23,24 and the SARS coronavirus.25 We and other groups have identified functionally significant\nG4s in the Nef coding region26 and the\nunique long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter27\u221229 of the human\nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV), the etiologic agent of the acquired\nimmune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). These studies have shown that G4\nfolding at the LTR promoter decreased viral transcription with an\neffect that was augmented by a G4 ligand.27,30\n\nThe involvement of G4 structures in several human diseases\npropelled\nthe development of G4 ligands. Several aromatic cores with protonable\nside chains bind the G4 conformation, such as porphyrins,31,32 acridines, such as 1 (BRACO-19, Scheme 1),33,34 fluoroquinolones35 anthraquinones, phenanthrolines, quinacridines,\ncarbazoles, bis-indole carboxamides, triazoles, and benzimidazoles;36 natural compound derivatives, such as berberine,37 telomestatin,38 quindolin,39 several tetra-substituted perlyene tetracarboxylic40 and water-soluble naphthalene diimide (NDIs).41\u221246 So far, the vast majority of molecules has been tested against cellular\nG4s implicated in tumor pathogenesis: some compounds showed interesting\nantiproliferative properties;36 in particular,\nquarfloxin proceeded into phase II clinical trials, but its limited\nbioavailability prevented further progress.35 Few molecules have been tested also as antiviral agents:23,27,30,47 despite the low selectivity indexes, these studies have shown the\npossibility to develop antiviral molecules with a G-quadruplex-mediated\nmechanism of action.\n\nThe lateral expansion of the NDI core provided by our\ninvestigation\nmay offer an additional opportunity to enhance both G4 binding potency\nand selectivity, discriminating G4 structures with different accessibility\nto the edge quartets. Examples that comprise the annulation of five-\nand six-membered heterocyclic rings either on one side of the NDI48,49 or on both sides have been reported (Scheme 1).50,51 Surprisingly, only\none class of these core-extended NDIs (c-exNDIs) has\nbeen engineered water-soluble to be investigated as G4 ligand,44 the others have found applications in the field\nof material chemistry and as pH sensors.49\u221251\n\nBecause\nof the possibility to block HIV-1 transcription by stabilizing\nthe G4 structures present in the unique viral LTR promoter, we here\nsynthesized and tested a series of novel c-exNDIs for\nboth their binding to the LTR G4s and anti-HIV-1 activity. In these\nnew structures, the NDI core has been merged to the dihydrobenzophenazine\npolynuclear heterocycle (highlighted in red in Scheme 1). We proved that these derivatives display\nbinding and stabilization selectivity toward the viral G4s as compared\nto a telomeric G4 and that this translates into a therapeutic window\nwhere the compounds are active against the virus but not toxic for\nthe cell.\n\nWe have\ndesigned and synthesized a small library of new and water-soluble c-exNDIs (2\u201311, Scheme 2), where the NDI\ncore has been merged to the dihydrobenzophenazine polynuclear heterocycle\n(highlighted in red in Scheme 1). The choice has been made based on the pKa values of the N,N-dimethylpropan-amine\nside chains: the pKa values are above\n7 (pKa1 = 8.1, pKa2 = 8.6),52 suggesting that the\nside chains are mainly protonated under physiological conditions.\nThis aspect ensures good solubilizing properties, reducing self-aggregations.\nWe discharged the shorter N,N-dimethylthyl-amine\nside chains, as their pKa values are much\nlower (pKa1 = 5.6, pKa2 = 7.4). The c-exNDIs are structurally\ncharacterized by a larger flat core than the NDIs. This feature should\nimprove \u03c0-stacking interaction implementing the binding to the\nG4. Indeed, DFT calculation performed at B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level of\ntheory in gas phase indicated that the dimension of the c-exNDI core supported a more extensive overlap to the quartet of the G4\nstructure (Supporting Information, Figure S1). Enhancement of the ligand steric hindrance accessing the outside\nG4 quartets might offer an opportunity to implement selectivity as\nwell. Furthermore, the proposed structural extension on the NDI scaffold\nshould merge the useful optoelectronic properties (absorption, emission,\nand singlet oxygen sensitizer) of functionalized NDIs to those of\nsubstituted dihydrobenzophenazines. Compounds with both H and Br substituents\nat the Y position were considered to evaluate the effect of a bulky\nsubstituent (Br) at this position. To synthesize the c-exNDIs, we developed the synthetic protocol highlighted in Scheme 2. According to published methods,\nthe imidation reaction of the readily available 2,6-dibromo-1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic\ndianhydride yielded the 2,6-dibromo-substituted NDI, under acidic\nconditions, in almost quantitative yield. Subsequently, a two-step\nprotocol starting from a nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) in the presence of an excess (2.5 equiv) of ortho-diaminophenyl derivatives in DMF as solvent at 70 \u00b0C for 16\nh afforded a 60:40 mixture of monobrominated and debrominated products\nin an overall quantitative yield. The ring closing reaction following\nthe SNAr in one pot (step a, in Scheme 2) occurred through a Tchitchibabin mechanism,\nwith the elimination of hydride favored by the formation of a six-membered\nring. The second SNAr on the remaining aromatic bromide\nwas carried out by dissolving 3 in neat N1,N1-dimethylpropane-1,3-diamine.\nTo improve the reaction yield, we optimized a microwave-assisted protocol\n(150 \u00b0C, 200 psi, 250 bar, 200 W, 3 min, sealed reaction vessels)\nto give product 9, which crystallized from the reaction\nmixture. We achieved the synthesis of the permanently charged quaternary\nammonium salts 10 and 11 with a classical\nexhaustive methylation, in the presence of MeI at rt for 16 h. All\nthe synthesized ligands (2\u201311) were\npurified by preparative HPLC (CH3CN:H2O and\n0.1% CF3COOH as eluent). Further anion exchange yielded 2\u20139 as hydrochloride salts. On the contrary, 10 and 11 were investigated as iodide quaternary\nammonium salts.\n\nTo detect\nthe ability of the new c-exNDIs to bind and stabilize\nthe G4 conformations of the HIV-1 LTR promoter, two G4-forming LTR\nsequences were employed: LTR-III and LTR-IV, both composed of four\nGGG tracts (Figure 1A). When embedded within the full-length G-rich sequence of the LTR\npromoter, LTR-III is the most stable G4, while LTR-IV folds when induced\nby G4 ligands.27 A FRET melting assay was\nperformed to assess the degree of stabilization of the LTR-III and\nLTR-IV G4 by c-exNDIs. The minimal intramolecular G4-forming\nhuman telomeric (hTel) sequence (Figure 1A) was employed to evaluate the activity\nof the c-exNDIs on one of the most highly represented\nand accessible cellular G4: in fact, the TTAGGG repeat is present\nas 2000\u20133000 double-stranded (ds) and 50\u2013200 single-stranded\nsequences at the human telomeres.53 A double-stranded\n(ds) DNA was also added to address specificity toward the G4 conformation\n(Supporting Information, Table S1). While\nthis kind of assay is typically performed using molar excess of the\ntested compounds, we here initially employed equimolar amounts of\nthe target DNA sequence and compounds (i.e., 0.25 \u03bcM) to better\ndifferentiate the stabilization efficiency among the different c-exNDIs. The melting temperatures of the LTR-III, LTR-IV,\nhTel, and dsDNA G4 conformations were sufficiently similar (66.9,\n61.9, 66.9, and 66.5 \u00b0C, respectively) to allow a meaningful\ncomparison. In the presence of the c-exNDIs, a marked\nincrease in the stabilization of the G4-forming oligonucleotides was\nobserved (Figure 1B\nand Supporting Information, Table S2).\nAmong the tested c-exNDIs, 2, 3, 4, 10, and 11 were the most\nefficient ligands, with a stabilization on LTR-IV G4 of 10\u201316\n\u00b0C at equimolar amounts. At 4-fold c-exNDI:DNA molar\nratio, the stabilization increased to above 25 \u00b0C, which is the\nmaximum increase measurable in these settings (data not shown). The\nother c-exNDIs showed intermediate (4 \u00b0C \u2264\n\u0394Tm < 7 \u00b0C, 5, 6, and 7), or low (\u0394Tm < 4 \u00b0C, 8 and 9) level\nof stabilization on LTR-IV G4. Compounds 2 and 10 stabilized LTR-III G4 above 10 \u00b0C. Among the G4 structures,\nhTel G4 was the least efficiently stabilized, whereas stabilization\non dsDNA was negligible. Only compounds 10 and 11 displayed a significant stabilization on dsDNA, indicating\nthat the presence of two permanent charges (the quaternary ammonium\nmoieties) favors an unspecific binding to the negatively charged nucleic\nacid. In general, the H series of all derivatives (Y = H, 2, 4, 6, 10; Scheme 2) was more active and more\nselective for the viral G4s compared to the Br substituted ones (Y\n= Br, 3, 5, 7, 8; Scheme 2). Compounds 2, 3, and 10 exhibited a difference\nin stabilization of LTR-IV G4s vs hTel G4 equal or above 6 \u00b0C,\nwhich roughly corresponds to 40% of the overall stabilization efficiency\n(Figure 1B and Supporting\nInformation, Table S2).\n\nBecause oligonucleotides used\nfor FRET analysis display fluorophore-modified\nends that may influence the measured stabilization, additional techniques\nusing label-free oligonucleotides were employed. Compound 2, a representative of the best ligands, was assayed by circular dichroism\n(CD) on LTR-IV, LTR-III, and hTel G4s. At 4:1 c-exNDI:DNA ratio, a stabilization higher than 27 \u00b0C was obtained on\nboth LTR-III and LTR-IV (Supporting Information, Figures S2A and S2B), while hTel G4s was stabilized by only\n19.9 \u00b0C (Supporting Information, Figure S2C), confirming a preference for the viral G4s. A Taq polymerase stop assay was performed on the LTR-III, LTR-IV, and\nhTel templates. A control template unable to fold into G4 was used\nto exclude unspecific inhibition of the polymerase enzyme by the c-exNDI. Compound 2 induced an intense stop site\nat the most 3\u2032 G tract in each G4-forming template (Figure 1C), indicating effective\nstabilization of the G4 conformation by the compound. This effect\nwas significantly more relevant on the viral sequences vs the telomeric\ntemplate (Figure 1D),\nconfirming again a preferential stabilization of the viral G4s.\n\nThe above techniques evaluated stabilization of the G4 conformation\nas an indicator of the efficiency of the interaction of the ligands\nwith the tested G4 structures. Binding affinity was next directly\nassessed by two different methods.\n\nCompetition electrospray\nionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS)\nexperiments54\u221256 allowed establishment of the relative affinity of\nthe c-exNDIs toward the G4 sequences. We first confirmed\nby CD analysis that in the buffer conditions used for the ESI/MS experiments\nthe topology of the G4-folded oligonucleotides did not significantly\nmodify (Supporting Information, Figure S3) Equimolar amounts of LTR-III/hTel, LTR-IV/hTel, and LTR-III/LTR-IV\nG4s were incubated with 2-fold molar excess of compounds 2 or 4. Because ESI/MS transfers intact biomolecules\ncomplexes in the gas phase and signal intensity is proportional to\nthe abundance of each species in solution, the ratio between m/z signals of each bound species and the\ncorresponding bound and free G4 (Figure 2A) was calculated (Table 1). While LTR-III and LTR-IV were detected\nmostly as all-bound species, hTel was mostly unbound (Figure 2A, and Supporting Information, Figures S4A and S4B). This analysis clearly shows\nthat our c-exNDIs preferentially bind the two viral sequences\nover the telomeric sequence. To corroborate the selectivity toward\nthe viral sequences, two additional cellular G4 folding sequences\nwere evaluated: c-kit257 and c-myc.32 The LTR G4s were preferred over c-kit2 G4 by\nboth compounds; in the case of c-myc G4, compound 4 preferentially\nbound to the LTR G4s, whereas compound 2 showed more\nintense binding to c-myc (Table 1). Therefore, we confirmed a general, even though not\nabsolute, selectivity toward the LTR G4s. It is also possible that\nthe much higher stability of the c-myc G4 (Tm > 95 \u00b0C) vs the stability of the other tested G4s\n(LTR-III\n66.9 \u00b0C, LTR-IV 61.9 \u00b0C, c-kit2 72.1 \u00b0C) played a role\nin this result. When the two LTR G4s were competed with each other,\nthe LTR-III sequence was preferred. At 2-fold excess of compound,\nLTR-III bound up to two molecules of compounds, whereas only one molecule\nwas obtained for both LTR-IV and hTel (Figure 2, and Supporting Information, Figure S5). At saturating concentrations (10-fold\nmolar excess), three molecules were bound to LTR-III G4, whereas up\nto two molecules could bind LTR-IV and hTel G4s (Supporting Information, Figure S5).\n\nNext, absolute\naffinity of 2 was measured by surface\nplasmon resonance (SPR) toward the three G4-folded sequences. This\nanalysis confirmed that LTR-III G4 displays the highest binding affinity\n(KD 3.2 nM), followed by LTR-IV G4 (KD 6.1 nM); hTel G4 exhibited the lowest affinity\n(KD 13.1 nM) (Figure 2B, and Supporting Information, Figure S6). The binding affinity of the Br derivatives\nwith each of the substituents in position R against LTR-IV was next\nassessed. Compounds 3 and 5 had KD values similar to that of 2 (KD 6.6 and 5.9 nM, respectively), 10 displayed an increased binding affinity (KD 1.7 nM), whereas 7 and 11 showed\nthe lowest affinity (KD 21.6 and 12.9\nnM, respectively). These data are in line with the stabilization properties\nobserved for these derivatives by FRET and CD analysis and confirm\nthe improved and reduced recognition properties of the c-exNDIs exhibiting permanent dicationic (10) and neutral or\nmonocationic charge states (7), respectively, under physiological\nconditions. They also confirm that a bulky substituent in position\nY of the NDI core (11, Scheme 2) highly reduces binding, whereas a NO2 group in position R maintains excellent binding properties\n(5, Scheme 2).\n\nWe reasoned that the observed biased affinity for the LTR\nsequences\ncould derive by specific binding of the c-exNDIs to structural/sequence\nfeatures shared by the LTR G4s. To this end, we evaluated the protection\nexerted by compound 2 over residues of the LTR G4s against\nclerocidin (CL). This molecule has been shown to alkylate DNA single-stranded\nG, C, and A bases58,59 and to be able to predict G4\nstructural folding.60 Labeled oligonucleotides\nwere folded, treated with increasing amounts of 2, exposed\nto CL, and further treated with piperidine to highlight CL-alkylated\nsites. In these settings, we expected to visualize only loop bases\nbound by the c-exNDI because base-paired Gs involved\nin G-quartet formation would not be available to CL alkylation, independently\nof the presence of the compound. The NMR structure of LTR-IV has been\nsolved (PDB code 2N4Y), and therefore we were able to assess that nucleotides affected\nby the presence of the c-exNDI were in two loops of the\nstructure: in particular, in the ACTG loop the A base was protected,\nwhereas C and G were exposed; in the 1-base-loop, the C base was exposed\n(Figure 2C and 2E). The structure of LTR-III has not been solved\nyet, however, previous data indicated that this G4 can fold into different\nconformations, the main one of which is likely the one depicted in Figure 2E, as detected by\nlow-resolution structural data.27 In this\ncase, we observed protection of the C base in the ACTG loop (Figure 2D), which is shared\nwith the LTR-IV sequence (see Figure 1A); three additional residues (C, C, and G) were protected\nin the 11-base-loop (Figure 2D and 2E). Protection and exposure\nof residues indicated specific interaction of 2 at the\naffected LTR sites. Interestingly, unique LTR loops and in particular\nthe ACTG loop shared by both LTR-III and LTR-IV, and absent in the\ntelomeric sequence, were involved, indicating that these are likely\nthe moieties that induce selectivity. We cannot exclude that other\nregions are bound by the c-exNDI, but probably the interaction\nat other sites is less stable or more dynamic so that a clear protection/exposure\ncould not be observed.\n\nWe have previously shown that the HIV-1 viral\npromoter folds into dynamic G4s and that stabilization of these G4\nconformations by the G4 ligand 1 represses viral transcription\nand virus production in infected cells with IC50 (the concentration\nrequired to inhibit 50% of virus production) in the low \u03bcM range.27,30 The average selectivity index (SI) for 1 was 12. Given\nthe c-exNDI binding/stabilization selectivity observed\nin vitro for the viral G4s vs the cellular G4, we set out to investigate\nthe anti-HIV-1 activity of the newly synthesized c-exNDI derivatives. Compound entry was preliminarily measured by phase\ncontrast and fluorescence microscopy, taking advantage of the blue-colored c-exNDI dyes (\u03bbabs = 555 and 600 nm, for\nthe unsubstituted 2) and their red fluorescence emission\n(\u03bbem = 610 and 655 nm, for 2). After\n30 min of incubation, compounds concentrated into the cell (Supporting\nInformation, Figure S7). We next treated\ninfected cells with increasing amounts of compounds and measured virus\nproduction; concurrently, the cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of the c-exNDIs in the same conditions but on uninfected\ncells was measured by MTT assay. All compounds were tested against\nthe HIV-1 NL4-3 strain, which is a X4 strain. Results are reported\nin Table 2. Compounds 2, 3, 4, and 5 displayed\ninhibitory concentration (IC50) values below 25 nM. Compound 2 displayed a promising SI of 40, the best among the tested c-exNDIs, whereas SI values of compound 3, 4, and 5 were around 20, again superior to 1. Derivatives 6 and 7 exhibited\nlow activity and low cytotoxicity, while 9 showed the\nworst combination with low activity, high cytotoxicity, and SI of\n2.2. We also evaluated the range of concentration (therapeutic window\nor TW), at which we obtained antiviral activity paralleled by less\nthan 80% cytotoxicity. As shown in Figure 3A, 2 displayed the widest TW\n(3.9\u2013250 nM); 4 and 5 also showed\ninteresting TW values; TW concentrations for 6 and 7, which are likely to be mainly monoanionic under physiological\nconditions as both the (CH2)3NHMe2+ moieties exhibit a pKa >8.1,52 were in the \u03bcM range; no TW was observed\nfor 8 and 9 (Table 1). Finally, 10 and 11, containing two quaternary ammonium moieties, did not display any\nantiviral or cytotoxic activity likely due to their inability to enter\nthe cells, as already shown for NDIs with permanent positive charges.61 Compound 2 and 3 were\nalso tested on the HIV-1 BaL strain, a R5 strain with a different\ntropism. In this case, IC50 values below 40 nM were obtained,\nwith SI of 14 for the H derivative (Table 1). Note that the H series of all derivatives\nwas more active than the Br substituted one. Moreover, all compounds\ndisplayed CC50 values higher than 2 \u03bcM against a\nhuman fibroblast cell line.\n\nIt has been reported\nthat compounds with multiple positive charges\ncan block viral entry by interfering with the CXCR4 coreceptor.62 To rule out this unspecific mechanism of action\nof the c-exNDI, we treated TZM-bl cells at 0, 1, and\n2 h post infection (pi) with compound 2 and tested virus\nproduction at 31 h pi. No significant difference in the activity of\nthe compound was observed at the tested times (Figure 3B). Zidovudine (AZT), a reference drug that\ntargets the reverse transcriptase step,63 displayed a behavior similar to that of the c-exNDI, maintaining activity from 0 to 2 h pi. In contrast, dextran sulfate\n(DS), a reference entry inhibitor,64 exhibited\nantiviral effect only when added at 0 h pi. (Figure 3B). These data indicate that the initial\nsteps are not targeted by 2, which is thus active at/after\n2 h pi, i.e., after the entry process has occurred.\n\nWe next\ntested the ability of 2 to reduce the activity of the\nHIV-1 LTR promoter in an EGFP reporter assay in HeLa-tat-III cells,\nwhich is a cell line stably transfected with a plasmid embedding the\nEGFP coding region under the control of the HIV-1 LTR promoter. Cells\nwere treated with increasing concentrations of the c-exNDI, and the intensity of EGFP fluorescence was assessed by FACS analysis.\nA steady decrease in the mean levels of EGFP was observed at noncytotoxic\nconcentrations of 2 (up to 60% of inhibition) (Figure 3C). To check if the\nactivity of the c-exNDI at the LTR promoter was specific\nfor the G4 conformation, two point mutations that abolish G4 folding\nwere introduced in the LTR sequence (M4 + 5 LTR).27 The wt LTR and M4 + 5 LTR luciferase reporter plasmids\nwere transiently transfected into 293T cells either alone or in the\npresence of increasing amounts of compound 2, and the\nluciferase signal was measured. Again, an important inhibition of\nLTR activity was observed on the wt LTR (up to 65% inhibition), whereas\nno effect was detected on the non-G4-forming mutant LTR sequence (Figure 3D). These data indicate\na G4-mediated inhibition of the viral promoter by the c-exNDI.\n\nWe have here shown the synthesis,\nG4 binding properties, and antiviral\nactivity of a new series of NDI derivatives with an extended aromatic\ncore. First, most of the new compounds displayed improved stabilization\non G4 structures, with substantial increments in Tm above values previously reported for NDI derivatives.41\u221246 This feature is an indication that the expansion of the aromatic\nsurface allows a more effective recognition of the G4 structure. This\nmay be due to a more extensive overlap to the quartet of the G4 structure,\nas inferred by the dimension of the c-exNDI core, evaluated\nby DFT calculation (Supporting Information, Figure S1). Second, these compounds exhibited a very promising antiviral\nactivity. Compared to 1,30 the best antiviral 2\u20135 showed improved\nIC50 values (in the low nM vs low \u03bcM range). This\nfeature may derive from the selectivity observed in vitro for the\nLTR G4s over the telomeric G4 structures. The viral and telomeric\nG4s are likely the two most abundant DNA G4 species in the cell during\ninfection, therefore a preferential effect on the viral G4s would\nresult in higher antiviral activity and lower cytotoxicity, as observed.\nThe c-exNDIs displayed both selective binding affinity\nand stabilization for the viral G4s. Between the two LTR G4s, the\nLTR-III sequence was most efficiently bound by 2, as\nmeasured by ESI/MS and SPR. Even though LTR-III (38 nts) and LTR-IV\n(29 nts) display an identical number of G-quartets, LTR-III offers\nlonger loops that may accommodate additional molecules and therefore\nmay display increased binding affinity. Indeed, at saturating concentrations,\nbinding of up to three c-exNDI molecules was observed\nby ESI/MS with LTR-III compared to two molecules for LTR-IV. In addition,\ntwo loops in both LTR-III and LTR-IV G4s were shown to be involved\nin c-exNDI interaction by footprinting analyses. We suggest\nthat the compounds interact with the edge G-quartets through the core\nNDI planar aromatic surface, while the extended moiety and side chains\ninteract with the side loops, affording selectivity toward the LTR\nG4s. To our knowledge, this is the first example of this type of selectivity\nbased on chemical recognition of specific residues; in fact, previously\nreported selectivity rather relied on the recognition of a G4 conformation.65\n\nAnalysis of the binding activity of the\nseries of c-exNDIs led us to the following structure\u2013activity\nrelationship (SAR)\nconclusions: (i) the nonextended side of the c-exNDI core\n[position Y (Scheme 1)], lacking substituents as the introduction of an aminoalkyl side\nchain, highly hinders stabilization of the G4 structures (i.e., 9); (ii) Br is allowed as Y substituent, but it lowers binding\nand selectivity toward the viral sequences. The Br group may both\nhinder specific interactions (hence lower selectivity) and partially\ndistort the aromatic core from planarity (hence lower G4 binding);\n(iii) the pyridine ring in place of the benzene in the extended core\nis strongly detrimental (compound 8). The fair antiviral\nactivity is paralleled by moderate cytotoxicity, allowing no TW, possibly\ndue to off-target activity; (iv) the NO2 moiety is allowed\n(compounds 4 and 5) as compound 4 is the most powerful and selective ligand toward LTR-III; (v) the\nnegatively charged carboxylate group decrease the electrostatic component\nof the binding to the DNA G4s (compounds 6 and 7); (vi) on the contrary, the permanently positively charged\nammonium groups extensively increase binding to the target G4s by\nadding electrostatic interaction (compounds 10 and 11). However, compounds with permanent charges are not suitable\nfor cell entry and hence cannot be exploited for antiviral purposes.\nA scheme of the chemical properties that lead to high-affinity recognition\nand selectivity of the c-exNDI binders is reported in\nthe graphical abstract.\n\nIn conclusion, we have reported a new\nclass of G4 ligands able\nto discriminate G4 structures based on the chemical recognition of\nstructural features that are unique to the selected G4 sequences.\nOn one hand this approach opens the possibility to develop anti-HIV\ncompounds with a new mechanism of action that may complement current\nclinical AIDS therapies; on the other hand, our work clearly highlights\nthe possibility to selectively recognize G4 structures with small\nmolecules, prompting the search and development of G4 ligands specific\nfor G4s implicated in several important human diseases.\n\nReagents, oligonucleotides,\nsolvents, and chemicals were purchased from Alfa Aesar or Sigma-Aldrich\nand were used as supplied without further purification. TLC analysis\nwas carried out on silica gel (Merck 60F-254) with visualization at\n254 and 366 nm. HPLC analysis and purifications were performed using\ntwo different HPLC: Waters system combining a Delta 600 PUMP, a 2489\nUV/vis detector and Fraction Collector III (for preparative and analytical),\nand an Agilent system series 1260 (for analytical). The analytical\ncolumn was XSelect CSH Phenyl-Hexyl (150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm) (Waters).\nThe preparative column was XSelect CSH Prep phenyl\u2013hexyl 5\n\u03bcm (150 mm \u00d7 30 mm) (Waters). Flows were 1 or 1.4 mL/min\nfor analytical and 27 mL/min for preparative. For the analytical analysis\nwere used the following method A: (aqueous solvent: 0.1% trifluoroacetic\nacid in water; organic solvent, acetonitrile); method A = 1 mL/min,\nisocratic flow over 2 min 95% of aqueous solvent; gradient, 95% aqueous,\ngradually to 40% aqueous over 12 min and at the end an isocratic flow\nover 4 min.

For fluorescence\nmelting curves, equimolar amounts of the compounds were added to each\nFAM (6-carboxyfluorescein) 5\u2032-end- and TAMRA (6-carboxy-tetramethylrhodamine)\n3\u2032-end-labeled oligonucleotide (0.25 uM) folded in the lithium\ncacodylate buffer supplemented with potassium (100 mM). After stabilization\nat 4 \u00b0C, samples were processed in a LightCycler II (Roche, Milan,\nItaly) or LightCycler 480 (Roche, Milan, Italy), and the oligonucleotide\nmelting was monitored by observing 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM) emission\nin the temperature range of 30\u2013 95 \u00b0C with 1 \u00b0C/min\ngradient. Melting profiles were normalized as previously described.66Tm was defined as\nthe temperature corresponding to the 0.5 fraction of the normalized\nfluorescence.\n\nFor CD analysis, oligonucleotides were diluted\nto a final concentration of 4 \u03bcM in lithium cacodylate buffer\n(10 mM, pH 7.4) and KCl 100 mM. After annealing step (95 \u00b0C for\n5 min), DNA samples were gradually cooled to room temperature and\ncompounds added from stock at final concentration of 16 \u03bcM.\nCD spectra were recorded on a Chirascan-Plus (Applied Photophysisics,\nLeatherhead, UK) equipped with a Peltier temperature controller using\na quartz cell of 5 mm optical path length and an instrument scanning\nspeed of 50 nm/min over a wavelength range of 230\u2013320 nm. The\nreported spectrum of each sample represents the average of 2 scans\nis baseline-corrected for signal contributions due to the buffer.\nObserved ellipticities were converted to mean residue ellipticity\n(\u03b8) = deg \u00d7 cm2 \u00d7 dmol\u20131 (mol ellip). For the determination of Tm, spectra were recorded over a temperature range of 20\u201395\n\u00b0C, with temperature increase of 5 \u00b0C/min. Tm values were calculated according to the van\u2019t\nHoff equation, applied for a two-state transition from a folded to\nunfolded state, assuming that the heat capacity of the folded and\nunfolded states are equal.67\n\nTaq polymerase stop\nassay was carried out as previously\ndescribed.27,30 Briefly, the 5\u2032-end labeled\nprimer was annealed to its template (Supporting Information, Table S1) in lithium cacodylate buffer in the\npresence or absence of KCl 100 mM and by heating at 95 \u00b0C for\n5 min and gradually cooling to room temperature. Where specified,\nsamples were incubated with 2 (3.1\u201325.0 nM). Primer\nextension was conducted with 2 U of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied\nBiosystem, Carlsbad, California, USA) at 47 \u00b0C for 30 min. Reactions\nwere stopped by ethanol precipitation, primer extension products were\nseparated on a 15% denaturing gel, and finally visualized by phosphorimaging\n(Typhoon FLA 9000).\n\nOligonucleotides\nwere heat-denatured and folded in 10 mM KCl, 150 mM trimethylammonium\nacetate (TMAA), pH 6.8, overnight at room temperature. The oligonucleotides\nwhere diluted to final concentration of 10 \u03bcM and incubated\nwith the tested compound at ratio DNA:compound 1:1 overnight at 4\n\u00b0C.\n\nSamples were analyzed by direct infusion electrospray\nionization (ESI) on a Xevo G2-XS QTof mass spectrometer (Waters, Manchester,\nUK). The injection was automatically performed by an Agilent 1290\nInfinity HPLC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, US) equipped\nwith an auto sampler; the carrying buffer was TMAA 100 mM. The absence\nof potassium in the carrying buffer allows the dilution of the salts\nbefore MS analysis decreasing the signal suppression. Up to 5 \u03bcL\nsamples were typically injected for each analysis. The electrospray\ncapillary was at 1.8 kV, the source and desolvation temperatures were\n45 and 65 \u00b0C, respectively, and the sampling cone was at 65 V.\nAll these parameters ensured minimal fragmentation of the DNAs complexes.\nThe instrument was calibrated using a 2 mg/mL solution of sodium iodide\nin 50% 2-propanol. Additionally, the use of the LockSpray during the\nanalysis provided a typical <2 ppm mass accuracy. The internal\nstandard LockSpray consisted in a solution of leu-enkephalin 1 \u03bcg/mL\nin acetonitrile/water (50:50, v/v) containing 0.1% formic acid. Binding\naffinities were calculated for each experiment using the reconstructed-ion\nchromatogram area for each species calculated by MassLynx V4.1: this\nanalysis was made possible by the experimental design that used an\nHPLC system to inject the samples in the mass spectrometer. The binding\naffinity was calculated with the following formula: [BA = (\u03a3G4b/(\u03a3G4f + \u03a3G4b)) \u00d7 100],\nwhere BA is the binding affinity, G4b is chromatogram area\nof bound G4 DNA, and G4f is the chromatogram area of free\nG4 DNA.68 G4b comprises DNA\nwith one or two bound ligands, where present. Signals with charge\nstates 6\u2013, 5\u2013, and 4\u2013 were used for the free and bound hTel DNA and c-myc, charge states\n6\u2013 and 5\u2013 for LTR-III, charge\nstates 5\u2013 and 4\u2013 for c-kit2, and\ncharge state 4\u2013 for LTR-IV. Free DNA mono and dipotassium\nadducts were included in the calculation. For stoichiometric calculation,\noligonucleotides were folded in 10 mM KCl, 150 mM TMAA pH 6.8 overnight\nat rt. The oligonucleotides, diluted to final concentration of 10\n\u03bcM, were incubated with the tested compound (ratio 1:5, 1:10,\n1:20, and 1:50) at 4 \u00b0C and analyzed by ESI-MS.\n\nSPR was performed on the Biacore T100\nplatform (GE Healthcare). 5\u2032-Biotinylated LTR-III, LTR-IV,\nand hTel oligonucleotides were heated at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min and\ncooled down at room temperature to allow G4 folding. Immobilization\nwas performed in HEPES-KCl running buffer (0.01 M HEPES pH 7.4, 0.2\nM KCl, 3 mM EDTA) on a steptavidin coated surface (SA sensor chip,\nBiacore). Oligonucleotides were diluted in HEPES-KCl running buffer\nto a concentration of 30 nM and injected to reach the response of\naround 500 RU. Flow cell 1 was left empty to allow reference subtraction. C-exNDIs binding analysis was performed at a flow rate of\n30 \u03bcL/min, with contact time of 280 s and dissociation time\nof 360 s in HEPES-KCl buffer. Sensorgrams were obtained in the concentration\nrange of 25\u2013200 nM. After each compound injection the chip\nsurface was regenerated with glycine 10 mM pH 2.0 solution (GE Healthcare).\nAll sensorgrams were corrected by buffer injection response. Data\nwere fitted to a 1:1 binding model with Rmax initial parameter set to theoretical calculated Rmax using BIAevaluation software (GE Healthcare). All\nexperiments were performed independently at least twice, and in each\ninstance \u03c72 values, which indicate the goodness of\nfitting, were below 0.2.\n\nAll oligonucleotides\nwere\ngel-purified before use and prepared in desalted/lyophilized form.\nOligonucleotides were 5\u2032-end-labeled with [\u03b3- 32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified by MicroSpin G-25\ncolumns (GE Healthcare, Europe). They were next resuspended in lithium\ncacodylate 10 mM, pH 7.4, and KCl 100 mM, heat-denatured, and folded.\nReactions of the labeled G-quadruplex folded oligonucleotides (4 pmol/sample)\nwith increasing amounts of compound 2 (4\u2013100 nM)\nwere performed at 20 \u00b0C for 24 h in resuspension buffer. Samples\nwere then reacted with CL (100 \u03bcM) at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h. Reactions\nwere stopped by ethanol precipitation, resuspended, and either kept\non ice or treated at 90 \u00b0C for 30 min with 1 M piperidine to\ncomplete strand scission according to the Maxam and Gilbert protocol.\nSamples were then lyophilized, resuspended in formamide gel loading\nbuffer, and heated at 95 \u00b0C for 3 min. Reaction products were\nanalyzed on 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized by Typhoon\nFLA 9000 phosphorimaging analysis (GE Healthcare).\n\nThe HIV-1 promoter activity in live\ncells in the presence of 2 was monitored in HeLa-Tat-III/LTR/d1EGFP\ncells (obtained through the NIH AIDS Reagent Program, Division of\nAIDS, NIAID, NIH, from Dr. Satoh). This cell line derives from HeLa-tat-III\nand is transfected with d1EGFP under the control of HIV-1 LTR promoter.\nThen 8 \u00d7104 of HeLa-Tat-III/LTR/d1EGFP cells were\nseeded in a 12-well plate in 1 mL of DMEM/10% FBS medium supplemented\nwith Geneticin selective antibiotic (1 mg/mL, Life Technologies, Monza,\nItaly) and incubated overnight. Cells were next treated with increasing\nconcentrations of 2 (0\u201362.5\u2013125\u2013250\nnM) and incubated at 37 \u00b0C. After 48 h, cells were washed with\nPBS 1\u00d7 and resuspended in 500 \u03bcL of PBS 1\u00d7. To evaluate\nthe mean of EGFP fluorescence, a total of 10000 events were acquired\nfor each sample with an LRS 2 instrument using FACS DIVA Software\n(BD Bioscience) and analyzed with Flow Jo (Tree Star). Cell debris\nand dead cells were excluded from the analysis by gating on forward\nscatter (FSC) versus side scatter (SSC) and were quantified to estimate\nthe cytotoxicity.\n\nFor the luciferase assay, HIV-1 LTR region\n(wt or M4 + 5) was inserted into the promoterless luciferase reporter\nvector pGL4.10-Luc2 (Promega Italia, Italy), as previously reported.27 For assessment of luciferase activity, human\nembryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells were seeded in a 24-well plate\n(9 \u00d7 104 cells/well). Then 24 h later, cells were\ntransfected with 100 ng/well of pGL4.10-LTRwt or of pGL4.10-LTR-M4\n+ 5 using TransIT-293 transfection reagent (Mirus Bio LLC, Madison,\nWI, USA), according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. After 1\nh, cells were treated with 2 for 24 h at various concentrations.\nLuciferase activity was measured using the britelite plus Reporter\nGene Assay System (PerkinElmer Inc., Milan, Italy) at a Victor X2\nmultilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer Inc., Milan, Italy), according\nto the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Cells were lysed in RIPA\nbuffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Igepal, 0.1% SDS) and\nprotein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Thermo Scientific\nPierce, Monza, Italy). Luciferase signals were subsequently normalized\nto total protein content, according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol\n(http://ita.promega.com/~/pdf/resources/pubhub/cellnotes/normalizing-genetic-reporter-assays/).\n\nHIV-1\ninfectivity was measured using the TZM-bl reporter cell line (obtained\nthrough the NIH AIDS Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH,\nfrom Dr. J.C. Kappes, Dr. X. Wu, and Tranzyme Inc.). TZM-bl is a HeLa\ncell line stably expressing large amounts of CD4 and CCR5 and containing\nintegrated copies of the luciferase and \u03b2-galactosidase genes\nunder control of the HIV-1 promoter. TZM-bl were grown in DMEM supplemented\nwith 10% FBS. Cells (1 \u00d7104 cells/well) were seeded\nin 96-well plates and grown overnight to permit adherence prior to\ntreatment and viral infection. Cells were next infected with HIV-1\nNL4-3 strain or BaL strain at a MOI of 0.5, treated with serial dilutions\nof tested compounds, and incubated at 37 \u00b0C. After 48 h, cells\nwere washed with PBS 1\u00d7 and HIV-1 production was assessed following\nthe LTR-luciferase signal using the britelite plus Reporter Gene Assay\nSystem (PerkinElmer, Waltman, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s\nprotocol.\n\nCytotoxicity\nof tested compounds\nwas tested in parallel to antiviral and reporter assays by MTT. The\n50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) was defined as the concentration\nof test compound that was able to reduce the absorbance of the mock-infected\ncells by 50%. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was\ndefined as the concentration of test compound that inhibit 50% of\nLTR-Luciferase signal. The selectivity index (SI) is the relative\neffectiveness of the tested compound in inhibiting viral replication\ncompared to inducing cell death (CC50 value/IC50 value). The therapeutic window (TW) is the concentration range at\nwhich the compound shows antiviral activity paralleled by less than\n80% cytotoxicity.\n\nTZM-bl cells (1\n\u00d7 104 cells/well) were seeded in 96-well plates and\ngrown overnight to\npermit adherence prior to treatment and viral infection. Cells were\nnext infected with HIV-1 NL4-3 (MOI 0.5) and incubated at 37 \u00b0C.\nCompound 2 (50\u2013100 nM) and the reference compounds\nDS (100 \u03bcg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich) and AZT (0.5 \u03bcg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich)\nwere added at different hours (0, 1, 2 h) pi. After 31 h, cells were\nwashed with PBS 1\u00d7 and HIV-1 production was assessed following\nthe LTR-luciferase signal using the britelite plus Reporter Gene Assay\nSystem (PerkinElmer, Waltman, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s\nprotocol.\n\nDFT calculations\nwere performed\nwith the Gaussian 09, revision B.01 software package.69 Gas-phase geometry optimizations were carried out using\nthe B3LYP functional,70 with 6-31+G(d,p)\nbasis set for all the atoms."}
