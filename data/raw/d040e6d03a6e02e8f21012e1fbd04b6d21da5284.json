{"title": "US-Like Strain of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Outbreaks in Taiwan, 2013-2014", "body": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses (PEDVs) are enveloped viruses with a large, capped and polyadenylated RNA genome of approximately 28,000 nucleotides [6] . PEDVs belong to the genus Alphacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae and order Nidovirales. Other members of this subgroup include human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E, HCoV NL63 and Bats coronavirus 512/05 [8] . Although PEDV was first identified in Europe, it has become increasingly problematic in many Asian countries [6] and North America [7] . However, there is no retrospective study on the emergence of PEDV in Taiwan. Pigs of all ages can be affected and can exhibit degrees of diarrhea and loss of appetite, which vary according to age. In suckling piglets that exhibit watery diarrhea, dehydration with milk curd vomitus and thin-walled intestines with severe villus atrophy and congestion, PEDVs are associated with disease. The disease can progress to death within a few days. The outbreak is distinguished by a nearly 100% prevalence of illness among piglets after birth and death rates of 80-100%. Boars and sows with mild diarrhea, vomiting and anorexia for a few days were reported to recover within a week [6, 7] .\n\nThe spike (S) protein of coronavirus plays key roles in receptor binding for viral entry and neutralizing antibody induction for protective immunity [2] . CO-26K equivalent (COE) from the S protein of PEDV contains epitopes that are capable of inducing PEDV-neutralizing antibodies [1] . COE was found to be 1,495-1,914 bp of the coding sequence of spike protein gene of the PEDV strain Brl/87 [1] .\n\nPrior to late 2013, the prevalence of PEDV infection was relatively low with only sporadic infections. However, starting in December 2013, a remarkable increase in PEDV outbreaks occurred in Taiwan.\n\nSamples from 32 pig farms in central and southern Taiwan from December 2013 through January 2014 were submitted to the animal hospital of National Pingtung University of Science and Technology. All of the pig farms had similar disease histories, clinical signs and lesions, including the presence of a sudden outbreak and rapid spread in farms, high mortality in young pigs and diseases affecting animals of all age, notably, vomiting and diarrhea. Piglets under 2 weeks of age showed severe vomiting and watery yellowish diarrhea with morbidity and mortality ranging from 80 to 100% and 90 to 100%, respectively. However, sows, gilt, finishing, growing and nursery pigs only developed appetite loss, anorexia and soft feces for 3-7 days with no mortality during this outbreak. The infected suckling pigs showed different degrees of weight loss and dehydration. Thinned and distended small intestine walls with watery yellowish contents were recorded during necropsy. Microscopically, marked enterocyte exfoliation and vacuolation consistent with villi atrophy and blunt were observed in the jejunum and ileum sections. Additionally, the clinical specimens were collected and tested for rotavirus [3] , transmissible gastroenteritis virus [4] and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus [5] . All of the specimens were negative for rotavirus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus. A total of 68 samples from 25 pig farms were confirmed as positive for PEDV by reverse transcription PCR, and the partial S gene of PEDV was further analyzed [5] . The year of sampling, age and clinical history of each sampled pig are summarized in Table 1 .\n\nThe COE domain of PEDV was amplified by RT-PCR as described by Kim et al. [5] . Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the COE domain of the 20 PEDV isolates and reference PEDV isolates were aligned and analyzed with Our results indicate that the recent Taiwanese PEDV strains are closely related to those isolated from the U.S.A. These strains were responsible for the recent PEDV outbreak in Taiwan and produced a similar mortality rate and pathologic effects of US isolates. The US-like strain of the virus might have gained entry into Taiwan via unknown routes as early as December 2013. Taken together, our findings indicate that these PEDV outbreaks in Taiwan share a common evolutionary origin with the S gene of US strains of PEDV.\n\nThe phylogenetic relationship and sequence analyses of the Taiwanese PEDV strains indicate that the recent Taiwan PEDV isolates differed from previous Taiwanese PEDV isolates. Our data suggest that all recent Taiwanese PEDV isolates are genetically similar to US isolates identified in 2013. Additional PEDV cases should be investigated using continuous surveillance and sequence analysis."}
