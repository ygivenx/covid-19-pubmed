{"title": "Murine coronavirus neuropathogenesis: determinants of virulence", "body": "Murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), is a large, enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus (Figure 1) . MHV can cause a wide range of illness depending on the strain and the route of infection; these include respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and central nervous system (CNS) diseases. These infections provide models for the study of encephalitis and demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), hepatitis Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005) , and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (De Albuquerque et al, 2006) .\n\nNeurotropic strains of MHV, cause disease in the CNS when inoculated intracranially or intranasally. Virus generally does not reach the brain of immunocompetent mice if inoculated intrahepatically or intraperitoneally. After intranasal inoculation, the virus travels transneuronally up the olfactory nerves to the olfactory bulbs where it spreads into the brain parenchyma and eventually into the spinal cord (Barnett and Perlman, 1993; Perlman et al, 1989; Perlman et al, 1995; Sun and Perlman, 1995) . MHV is thought to also spread through the cerebrospinal fluid (Wang et al, 1992) . CNS infection leads to viremia and spread of virus to other susceptible organs such as the liver (Lavi et al, 1988; Lavi et al, 1986) .\n\nTwo neurotropic strains that are commonly studied are A59 and JHM. A59 is a tissue culture adapted dualtropic strain that infects the liver as well as the brain. A59 causes moderate to severe hepatitis and in the brain, mild encephalitis and demyelination (Lavi et al, 1984; Phillips et al, 1999) ; MHV induced demyelination provides a model for multiple sclerosis. Infectious A59 is generally cleared by ten days post intracranial inoculation after which mice develop demyelination peaking at three to four weeks post infection (Houtman and Fleming, 1996b; Matthews et al, 2001; Sutherland et al, 1997) .\n\nJHM was isolated from a paralyzed mouse (Cheever et al, 1949) and subsequently serially passaged in mouse brains, after which various clones, were isolated. The use of multiple JHM clones, with different levels of neurovirulence, by various labs has necessitated the use of additional nomenclature to distinguish among these isolates. JHM.SD (formerly designated as MHV-4) (Ontiveros et al, 2003) , the focus of this review, is among the most neurovirulent isolates (Fazakerley et al, 1992; Gallagher et al, 1990) , causing lethal encephalitis. An intracranial inoculation with only a few plaque forming units (PFU) of JHM.SD kills nearly all the infected mice within about one week. Like A59, JHM induces demyelinating disease in the surviving mice (Lampert et al, 1973; Perlman et al, 1987; Weiner, 1973) .\n\nBecause A59 and JHM.SD display vastly different levels of neurovirulence, we have used them to investigate the viral determinants of high MHV induced neuropathogenesis. JHM.SD has a fifty percent lethal dose (LD 50 ) of less than 10 PFU after intracranial inoculation of 4 week old C57BL/6 (B6) mice, while A59 is approximately 1000 fold less virulent, with a LD 50 of 3,000-5,000 PFU (Iacono et al, 2006; MacNamara et al, 2005) . Both A59 and JHM.SD infect all major CNS cell types, including neurons, astrocytes and microglia; viral antigen is found throughout the brain after infection with either virus, but JHM.SD produces more widespread infection with larger foci of viral antigen expression (Fishman et al, 1985; Lavi et al, 1988; Matsubara et al, 1991; Parham et al, 1986) .\n\nSeveral factors contribute to enhanced lethality of highly encephalitic JHM isolates, such as JHM.SD. These include: spread, replication and adaptive and innate immunity. The kinetics of viral replication and antigen expression as well as host response are diagrammed in Figure 2 . Several viral proteins have been investigated as to their role in strain-specific differences in MHV neurovirulence. A diagram of the MHV virion with structural proteins indicated as well as a schematic showing the locations of genes encoding both structural and nonstructural viral proteins is shown in Figure 1 . The expression of either the spike or nucleocapsid protein of JHM within the A59 background confers a decrease in LD 50 to less than 10 PFU after intracranial inoculation (Cowley et al, 2010; Iacono et al, 2006; Navas and Weiss, 2003; Phillips et al, 1999) . The virulence factors and well as the mechanisms by which viral proteins enhance neurovirulence are discussed below.\n\nIn primary hippocampal neuronal cultures, JHM.SD spreads more extensively than A59 suggesting that there is an inherent difference in spread among neurons in the absence of host factors such as the immune response. In these in vitro cultures, both A59 and JHM.SD produce foci of infection that increase in size over time, without increasing in number; this occurs more rapidly in JHM.SD infected cultures as compared with A59 infected. JHM.SD produces very low levels of infectious virus in the medium as compared with A59 , suggesting that JHM.SD spread is primarily neuron to neuron Phillips et al, 2002) . In rat hippocamapal neurons and in the neuronal cell line OBL-21, a JHM isolate used by S. Dales et al. was observed to move transneuronaly in a primarily retrograde movement with some anterograde movement as well (Pasick et al, 1994) .\n\nThe availability of reverse genetics systems has promoted the mapping of pathogenic properties to viral genes. Analysis of A59/JHM chimeric viruses demonstrated that the spike protein is largely responsible for the rapid spread of JHM. Replacement of the spike gene of A59 with that of JHM (rA59/S JHM ), confers increased spread in the brain and in primary hippocampal neurons, and conversely replacement of the JHM spike gene with that of A59 (rJHM/S A59 ) results in reduced spread in the brain (Iacono et al, 2006; Phillips et al, 2002) . Some MHVs, such as JHM 2.2-V-1, are less neuron-tropic and more glial-tropic (Wang et al, 1992) ; this is associated with mutations within the spike gene and confers decreased virulence. In the context of JHM/A59 chimeric viruses, the nucleocapsid protein of JHM also confers increases in the extent of viral antigen expressed in the brain; however, the mechanism is uncertain and nucleocapsid protein does not enhance neuron-to-neuron spread in primary hippocampal neuron cultures (Cowley et al, 2010) .\n\nAnother factor that contributes to high neurovirulence is the ability of some JHM variants, such as JHM.SD and JHM cl-2 (Taguchi et al, 1985) to spread in the absence of the canonical MHV receptor, CEACAM1a. This was originally demonstrated in tissue culture (Gallagher et al, 1992; Taguchi et al, 1999) and more recently in primary hippocampal neuron cultures . A very small number of cells in primary neuronal cultures derived from ceacam1a \u2212/\u2212 mice were infected by A59 or JHM.SD; however, A59 failed to spread beyond the initially infected neurons, while JHM.SD spread robustly. Furthermore, when ceacam1a \u2212/\u2212 mice were inoculated with sufficiently high titers of JHM.SD, but not A59, they developed lethal CNS disease (Miura et al, 2008) . Thus, the ability to spread in the absence of CEACAM1a may allow JHM.SD to spread more rapidly than A59 and/or infect different neuronal subsets.\n\nThe expression of CEACAM1a protein by neurons has never been demonstrated. When measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR), expression was barely above background and may have been due to contamination of other, CEACAM1a expressing, cell types . It was suggested that JHM cl-2 may first infect microglia, which had been demonstrated to express CEACAM1a (Ramakrishna et al, 2004) , and then spread into neurons (Nakagaki and Taguchi, 2005) . However, the observations that there are very few foci of infected ceacam1a \u2212/\u2212 neurons compared to wild type neurons and that A59 fails to spread from initially infected ceacam1a \u2212/\u2212 neurons, suggest that neurons express CEACAM1a, which is essential for spread of A59, but not JHM. It is not clear how either strain enters ceacam1a \u2212/\u2212 neurons.\n\nMost JHM isolates are not capable of CEACAM1a independent spread. One such isolate, JHM.IA, like JHM.SD, is highly neurovirulent, and both viruses spread rapidly in the CNS and are uniformly fatal in 4 to 6 week old mice (Haspel et al, 1978; Knobler et al, 1981; MacNamara et al, 2005; Ontiveros et al, 2001; Perlman et al, 1987) . However, JHM.SD is significantly more virulent than JHM.IA when assessed in a different model system, in which suckling mice are inoculated intranasally and nursed on dams previously immunized with JHM.IA (Ontiveros et al, 2003) . Thus the inability of JHM.IA to carry out CEACAM1a-independent spread may contribute to subtle differences in virulence, but the fact that JHM.IA is similarly virulent to JHM.SD in adult B6 mice suggests that CEACAM1a-independent spread is likely not the only reason for enhanced virulence of JHM.SD in adult mice. Furthermore, it is quite possible that CEACAM1a-independent spread is mechanistically different in primary neurons as compared with cell lines.\n\nThe role of hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) in neurovirulence and spread has been a subject of much speculation with evidence both for and against a role for HE in neurovirulence (LaMonica et al, 1991; Yokomori et al, 1995; Yokomori et al, 1992; Yokomori et al, 1993) . However, it was demonstrated that a recombinant A59 expressing the hemagglutininesterase of the MHV-S strain and the spike protein of JHM.SD was more neurovirulent, than an isogenic virus that does not express HE (Kazi et al, 2005) . However, abrogation of the expression of HE within a recombinant JHM.SD genome had no affect on neurovirulence (unpublished data). This implies that HE can enhance neurovirulence for some strains, but either does not modulate JHM.SD neurovirulence or the effect of HE expression during JHM infection is not detectable due to the very high neurovirulence of JHM.\n\nInfectious viral titers in the brains of mice infected with MHV do not always correlate with the severity of the infection. When inoculated at equivalent PFU, A59 and JHM.SD replicate to similar titers in the brain, even though JHM.SD is more lethal and expresses more intracellular antigen in the CNS (Cowley et al, 2010; MacNamara et al, 2005; Phillips et al, 1999) . In addition recombinant A59 expressing the JHM.SD spike gene (rA59/S JHM ) replicates to lower final titers than A59, even though, like JHM.SD, it has an LD 50 of less than 10 PFU and spreads more efficiently in the CNS than A59 (Phillips et al, 1999) . This may be due to the unstable nature of the JHM.SD spike protein, which can lead to receptor independent conformational changes and premature inactivation (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001; Krueger et al, 2001) . Consistent with this, the JHM.SD spike is more sensitive to heat and low pH treatments (Tsai et al, 2003) . Perhaps as a consequence, JHM.SD produces more virus particles per PFU than A59 (unpublished data) and replicates to significantly 100-1000 fold lower titers in tissue culture (Cowley et al, 2010; Phillips et al, 1999) . However, titer is indicative of disease severity in some cases, when comparing two viruses expressing the same spike protein. For example, recombinant A59 expressing the JHM nucleocapsid (rA59/N JHM ) is more lethal and infects more cells in the CNS than A59, and this is associated with greater replication in the brain (Cowley et al, 2010) .\n\nInfections with A59 or JHM.SD generate different cytokine/chemokine profiles. Infections with either virus induces macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which remain elevated throughout infection. A59 induces a strong protective IFN\u03b3 response (Rempel et al, 2004a; Scott et al, 2008) . JHM.SD, on the other hand induces a weaker IFN-\u03b3 response (Rempel et al, 2004a; Scott et al, 2008) and there is one report of a stronger IFN-\u03b2 response early in JHM.SD infection (Rempel et al, 2004a) . Additionally, JHM.SD induces more macrophage chemoattractants, such as macrophage inflammatory protein 1-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 (MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2) and MIP-2, consistent with the greater number of macrophages recruited into the CNS during JHM.SD infection (Iacono et al, 2006; Rempel et al, 2004b) . The robust macrophage infiltration induced by JHM.SD partially maps to the JHM.SD spike gene as evidenced by the greater level of macrophage recruitment in the CNS of rA59/S JHM infected mice as compared with A59 infected animals (Rempel et al, 2004b; Scott et al, 2008) .\n\nShortly after MHV infection, neutrophils traffic to the brain and release matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The combination of cytokines and MMPs causes disruption of the blood brain barrier, which facilitates the entry of mononuclear cells (Zhou et al, 2002) . JHM.SD infection leads to the recruitment of greater numbers of neutrophils than A59 infection, likely a result of the increased level of MIP-2 during JHM infection (Iacono et al, 2006; Rempel et al, 2004a; Scott et al, 2008) . Depletion of neutrorophils during infection with the more attenuated DM variant of JHM resulted in a reduction in inflammatory cell infiltration, increased viral replication, and increased lethality leading to the conclusion that neutrophils were protective against MHV infection . However, while neutrophils are important in early control of virus, they can be pathogenic in generating toxic reactive oxygen species. Indeed, the greater recruitment of neutrophils during JHM.SD infection compared to A59 was demonstrated to be more destructive than protective (Iacono et al, 2006) . Natural killer cells also enter the brain early in infection. They secrete IFN-\u03b3 which may assist in clearing virus early in infection before the adaptive immune response develops (Iacono et al, 2006; Rempel et al, 2004a) .\n\nThe adaptive immune response, both B cell and T cell, is important in restricting MHV infection. B cell deficient mice can clear virus with normal kinetics, but in the absence of neutralizing antibodies virus reappears in the CNS, but not the liver, about two weeks post infection Matthews et al, 2001) . SCID and nude mice fail to clear virus, indicating that T cells are important for clearance (Fazakerley et al, 1992; Houtman and Fleming, 1996a) . CD8 T cells are primarily responsible for viral clearance, while CD4 T cells are required for CD8 T cell recruitment and maintenance (Stohlman et al, 1998) . Adoptive transfer of CD4 T cells alone does not restrict virus replication, but depletion of CD4 T cells prevents CD8 T cell mediated protection (Sussman et al, 1989) . Consistent with the role for CD8 T cells in viral clearance, beta-2 microglobulin deficient mice, which are deficient in MHC class I expression are significantly more susceptible to A59 infection (Gombold et al, 1995) . Viral strain-dependent differences in T cell response make significant contributions to virulence. JHM.SD induces a weak T cell response, while the less virulent JHM 2.2-V-1 and A59 induce robust responses (Iacono et al, 2006; Marten et al, 2003; Rempel et al, 2004a) . Quantification of virus specific T cells after JHM 2.2-V-1 infection showed that priming and the initiation of T cell expansion occurs in the cervical lymph nodes (CLN). Dendritic cells (DC)s, carrying virus or viral antigen migrate from the brain to the CLN where antigenspecific T cell priming is believed to occur (Dorries, 2001; Stevenson et al, 1997) ; treatment of DCs with pertussis toxin prevents them from migrating from the CLN and, in turn, prevents T cell trafficking into the brain (Karman et al, 2004) . After initial expansion in the CLN, T cells expand further in the spleen before trafficking to the brain . Infectious JHM.SD is barely detectable in CLN, while A59 viral titers are much higher (Macnamara et al, 2008) . The induction of a robust T cell response does not map to spike, as rA59/S JHM induces a strong T cell response and infectious viral titers similar to A59 are detected in CLN (Cowley et al, 2010; Iacono et al, 2006; Macnamara et al, 2008; Rempel et al, 2004b) . The cytolytic activity as well as the production of IFN-\u03b3 by CD8 T cells are crucial for the ability to clear infection from the CNS (Marten et al, 2001; Parra et al, 1999) . While perforin is important for clearance from astrocytes (Lin et al, 1997; Parra et al, 2001) , IFN-\u03b3 facilitates cytolytic killing by upregulating MHC expression on infected cells and mediates clearance from oligodendrocytes Parra et al, 1999) . The mechanism of viral clearance from neurons is not yet known.\n\nAs discussed above, spike and nucleocapsid proteins have been implicated in strain differences in virulence. Several other MHV proteins have been investigated as candidate virulence determinants. Two MHV nonstructural proteins, ns2 and ns5a have been implicated in type I interferon antagonism (Koetzner et al, 2010)(unpublished) . Ns2 is predicted to have cyclic phosphodiesterase (CDP) activity. Mutations in either of two predicted catalytic histidines of ns2 of A59 confer the loss of the ability to replicate in the liver, but have no affect on neurovirulence or in vitro replication (Roth-Cross et al, 2009) . Similarly, a deletion of the ns2 gene of JHM had no affect on replication in vitro (Schwarz et al, 1990) , and had no detectable effect on virulence after intracranial inoculation (personal communication J. Leibowitz and S. Perlman). These data suggests that either the ability to resist interferon signaling is not as important in the CNS as in the liver or that resistance to interferon signaling by MHV is mediated through a different mechanism in the CNS. Ns5a, like ns2, is nonessential for replication in vitro (Yokomori and Lai, 1991) , but its role in neurovirulence has not been reported.\n\nThere are data indicating that the adenosine diphosphate ribose phosphatase (ADRP; X or macro) domain of nsp3 (encoded by ORF1a) (Gorbalenya et al, 1991; Putics et al, 2005; Putics et al, 2006) , internal protein, and ns4 are not likely to be important to the neurovirulence of JHM or A59. Mutation of the predicted catalytic residue in the ADRP domain of nsp3 of A59 does not alter the ability of virus to replicate in vitro or the CNS (unpublished data); however, interestingly such mutations confer reduced replication in the liver (Eriksson et al, 2008) . Abrogation of the internal protein (I) expression in the A59 genome had no affect on replication in the CNS (Fischer et al, 1997) or lethality after intracranial inoculation (unpublished data), and JHM ablated for ns4 expression was similar in lethality and CNS replication as wild type virus (Ontiveros et al, 2001) .\n\nThere is still much to learn about the mechanisms responsible for the high neurovirulence of JHM.SD. These include defining the roles, if any, that the envelope proteins, membrane (M) and small membrane (E) play in neurovirulence, and determining the possible impact of the many nonstructural proteins encoded in the replicase locus and ns5a play in neurovirulence. In addition, it is not fully understood how viral strain differences in the innate immune response may affect pathogenesis. It is also not well understood why JHM.SD fails to spread to and/or replicate in the CLN, and whether this is responsible for the weak T cell response to JHM.SD infection of the CNS and the ensuing high neurovirulence. Shown are schematic drawings of the kinetics of replication, viral antigen, T cells, neutrophils and macrophages in the brains of C57BL/6 mice infected intracranially with A59 compared with JHM.SD during the first two weeks of infection. Note that the graph is cropped and macrophage titers by day 7 in JHM.SD infected mice are approximately 4 times that of A59. JHM infected mice typically die by day 7 at a low dose (10-50 PFU) of virus."}
