{"title": "H, 13 C, 15 N resonance assignments of murine hepatitis virus nonstructural protein 3a NIH Public Access NIH-PA Author Manuscript", "body": "digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into pET3a expression plasmid (pnsp3a). The plasmid pnsp3a was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)-pLysS competent cells and plated on LB agar plates containing 100 mg/L ampicillin and 34 mg/L chloramphenicol. Uniformly 15 N, 13 C-labeled proteins were expressed in sterile minimal media containing 1X M9 salts (6 g/L Na 2 HPO 4 , 3 g/L KH 2 PO 4 , 0.5 g/L NaCl, pH 7.4), 2 mM MgSO 4 , 0.1 mM CaCl 2 , 0.25 mg/L thiamine hydrochloride, 100 mg/L ampicillin, 2.5 g/L 13 C glucose and 1 g/L 15 NH 4 Cl. A single colony from the transformation plate was used to inoculate a 200 mL M9 culture containing 100 mg/L ampicillin and grown overnight at 25 \u00b0C with shaking. The starter culture was used to inoculate 6 \u00d7 1L LB (100 mg/L ampicillin) cultures such that the 1L cultures would have an initial OD 600 of 0.1. Large cultures were grown at 37 \u00b0C with shaking until the OD 600 reached 0.6-0.8 at which time expression was induced with the addition of 500 \u03bcM IPTG. Cells were grown at 25 \u00b0C for an additional 16 h prior to harvesting by centrifugation at low speed. Cell pellets were frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C, thawed, and resuspended in 200 mL lysis buffer (25 mM Tris, 2 mM EDTA, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 0.1 g protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma), pH 8.0) and lysed by sonication. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation and 0.15% (v/v) PEI (polyethyleneimine) was added dropwise to the supernatant with stirring at 4 \u00b0C to precipitate nucleic acids. After stirring for 2 h, the solution was clarified by centrifugation. The supernatant was then subjected to (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 precipitation (50% then 80% saturation) and the 80% pellet was resuspended in 30 mL of Buffer A (25 mM Tris, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, pH 8.0) and extensively dialyzed against Buffer B (25 mM Tris, 2 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, pH 8.0). The sample was then subjected to purification using a Q-sepharose anion exchange column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with Buffer B. The dialyzed sample was loaded onto the column and eluted with a linear gradient from 100 mM NaCl to 400 mM NaCl over 24 column volumes. Fractions containing purified nsp3a were pooled and concentrated to a volume of less than 5 mL. The sample was then subjected to size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex75 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with Buffer C (50 mM KP i 100 mM KCl, 5 mM TCEP, pH 6.0). The purity of all final products was estimated to be > 95% pure by inspection of Coomassie-stained 18% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel and the integrity verified by ESI-MS.\n\nSamples for NMR were prepared in buffer containing 50 mM KP i 100 mM KCl, 5 mM TCEP, pH 6.0 in a 10% 2 H 2 O/90% H 2 O mixture or in 100% 2 H 2 O after lyophilization at protein concentrations ~200 \u03bcM. All NMR experiments were acquired on a Varian DDR 600 or 800 MHz spectrometer, each equipped with a cryogenic or room temperature probe, at the Indiana University METACyt Biomolecular NMR Laboratory. All data were collected at 25.0 \u00b0C. Proton resonances were referenced to an internal standard, 4,4-dimethyl-4silapentane-1-sulfonic acid (DSS). Nitrogen and Carbon resonances were referenced indirectly based on the proton reference frequency using the following values: C 0 = 0.251449530*H 0 , N 0 = 0.101329118*H 0 where H 0 represents the referenced proton frequency. Data were processed using NMRPipe/nmrDraw and analyzed using Sparky (Delaglio et al. 1995; Goddard and Kneller) .\n\nBackbone resonance assignments were made using three-dimensional CBCA(CO)NH, CBCANH, and HNCA experiments. Carbonyl carbon chemical shifts were obtained from a three dimensional HNCO experiment. Backbone torsion angles (\u03c6, \u03c6) were derived from 1 H, 15 N, and 13 C chemical shifts using the program TALOS+ (Shen et al. 2009 ). Aliphatic side chain carbons identified using the following suite of three-dimensional experiments: C(CO)NH-TOCSY, H(CCO)NH-TOCSY, 15 N-edited TOCSY-HSQC, HCCH-COSY, HCCH-TOCSY, and HNHA. Aromatic proton resonances were assigned using a two-dimensional HBCBCGCDHD spectrum and a three-dimensional 13 C-edited NOESY-HSQC (Marion et al. 1989 ) focused on the aromatic region.\n\nThe 1 H, 15 N HSQC spectrum of MHV nsp3a acquired at 25.0 \u00baC and pH 6.0 is shown in Fig.  1 . The spectrum is well dispersed and contains 108 resonances of which 106 were confidently assigned (98%). The backbone amides of D83 and M105 were not assigned. In total, greater than 92% of all side chain protons have been assigned. Chemical shift assignments for MHV nsp3a have been deposited in the BioMagResBank under accession ID 18587.\n\nBased on these backbone resonance assignments, secondary structure prediction of MHV nsp3a was analyzed using chemical shift indexing (CSI) (Wishart and Sykes 1994) and TALOS+ (Shen et al. 2009) and the results are shown in Fig. 2 . Both outputs are in good general agreement and collectively reveal that MHV nsp3a harbors four \u03b2-strands and three \u03b1-helices arranged from the N-terminus as \u03b21-\u03b11-\u03b22-\u03b12-\u03b13-\u03b23-\u03b24. The amide group of L27 is significantly downfield shifted and is located in a region of the molecule that is predicted as random coil by both TALOS+ and CSI. This downfield shift could be reporting residual \u03b2-strand character here but more likely reflects the influence of a strong ring current effect induced by the side chain of nearby F31 in the N-terminal region of the \u03b11 helix immediately following. 1 H, 15 N HSQC spectrum of MHV nsp3a. Backbone amide resonance assignments are labeled using one-letter amino acid code. The carboxamide NH 2 group of the single asparagine residue is labeled as N7 scNH 2 .
