{"title": "A 106 kDa Form of Aminopeptidase is a Receptor for Bacillus thuringiensis CrylC 8-Endotoxin in the Brush Border Membrane of Manduca sexta", "body": "Bacillus thuringiensis CrylC &endotoxin is a lepidopteran-specific insecticidal protein with a toxic spectrum different from CryIA 6-endotoxins. CryIC has high activity against Spodoptera species, which are relatively resistant to CryIA toxins. CryIC remains active against several insect species that have acquired resistance to CryIA toxins (Ferre et al., 1991; Tabashnik et al., 1994) . CryIC is released from B. thuringiensis crystals as a 135 kDa protoxin and cleaved to an active 62 kDa toxin in the alkaline insect midgut. Insecticidal activity is caused by toxin binding to midgut brush border membranes, then toxin integration into the membrane leading to pore formation, cell lysis and insect mortality (reviewed in Gill et al., 1992; Knowles and Dow, 1993) .\n\nCryIC and CryIA toxins recognize different sites in the larval midgut (Van Rie et al., 1990; Escriche et al., 1994) . CryIC and CryIAc binding sites are functionally *Department of Entomology, University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602-2603, U.S.A. +Author for correspondence: Tel. 706-542-2436; Fax. 706-542-2640;  e-mail adang @bscr.uga.edu distinct. For example, CrylAc resistant insect species (Plodia interpunctella and Plutella o'lostella) still bind and are killed by CrylC toxin. Several CrylC binding proteins have been described. Oddou et al. (1993) showed that CrylC toxin binds to a 40 kDa protein on ligand blots of brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) from three Spodoptera species. Sanchis and Ellar (1993) observed CrylC binding to 40 and 110 kDa proteins in S. littoralis midgut BBMV using a combination of toxinaffinity selection and ligand blotting. CrylAb and CrylAc binding proteins have been identified in Manduca sexta (Vadlamudi et al., 1993; Sangadala et al., 1994; Knight et al., 1994) . The CrylAb binding protein is a 210 kDa cadherin-like glycoprotein (Vadlamudi et al., 1995) , whereas the CrylAc binding protein is a 120 kDa aminopeptidase N (APN) (Sangadala et al., 1994; Knight et al., 1994) . Recently, Knight et al. (1995) cloned a M. sexta aminopeptidase that may encode the CrylAc receptor. To date the only functional evidence that aminopeptidase is a toxin receptor comes from Sangadala et al. (1994) who reconstituted a mixture of 120 kDa APN and a 65 kDa protein into membrane vesicles and measured a 30% increase in CrylAc binding and a 1000-fold decrease in the amount 784 KE LUO et al. of CrylAc toxin required to induce 86Rb+ efflux. The binding characteristics of CryIA toxins to the 115 kDa soluble form of the CryIAc receptor were determined using plasmon resonance spectroscopy (Masson et aI., 1995) . CryIAc binds at two sites, CryIAb and CryIAa recognize one site and CryIC does not bind to the 115 kDa molecule.\n\nAPN molecules themselves are of interest due to their important role in digestion. APN cleaves an amino acid from the N-terminus of proteins (Kenny et al., 1987) . In bovine renal BBMV, APN appears to be associated with Na+-dependent amino acid co-transport (Plakidou-Dymock et al., 1993) . The enzyme is found in both soluble and membrane-bound ectoenzyme forms. The ectoenzyme form is attached to the intestinal brush border cells of many animals by a hydrophobic N-terminal stalk (Kenny et al., 1987; Takasaki et al., 1991) . In insects, however, attachment is via a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (Tomita et al., 1994; Garczynski and Adang, 1995) . This observation agrees with the predicted amino acid sequence of the cloned aminopeptidase which has a typical carboxy terminal signal for attachment of the GPI anchor (Knight et al., 1995) . M. sexta brush border cells have a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC) which can cleave the lipid anchor from the 120 kDa CryIAc-binding APN, releasing a 115 kDa form (Lu and Adang, 1996) .\n\nIn this study we report that CrylC toxin binds to a 106 kDa form of APN in M. sexta midgut that is distinct from the CryIAc-binding APN previously identified in that species. The identification and purification of a CryIC-binding APN enables the comparison of the two APNs and elucidation of the determinants of toxin binding.\n\nAll chemicals, except where noted, were purchased from Sigma. N,N'-methylene-bis-acrylamide, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), glycine, Triton X-100, SDS molecular weight protein marker, polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane, EconoPac Q column and Bradford protein assay reagents were from Bio-Rad; BCA protein assay reagents were from Pierce. M. sexta eggs were obtained from the USDA, ARS, Biosciences Research Laboratory (Fargo, ND). A B. thuringiensis strain carrying only the crylC gene was provided by Ecogen. (Langhorne, PA) and B. thuringiensis strain HD-73 harboring only the crylAc gene was obtained from the Bacillus Genetic Stock Center (Ohio State University). mixture with 50 mM Na2CO3, pH 9.6, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol for 2 h at room temperature, then activated to toxin by treating with trypsin (0.5%, w/w) at room temperature for 15 min. After passing through a 0.2 /xm filter (Nalge), the trypsin-treated material was loaded on an EconoPac Q column pre-equilibrated with 20 mM NazCO3, pH 9.6. Toxin was eluted with a 0-0.6 M NaC1 gradient in the equilibration buffer using fast-performance liquid chromatography (FPLC, Pharmacia). Fractions containing toxin were pooled, dialysed against 20 mM NazCO 3 (pH 9.6) overnight, and re-fractionated using the same condition as above on a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Pharmacia). Purified toxin was stored in 20 mM Na2CO3, pH 9.6, containing 120 mM NaC1 at -20\u00b0C.\n\nM. sexta larvae were reared on artificial diet (Southland Products, Lake Village, AR) at 26\u00b0C, 70% r.h. with a photoperiod of 12:12 (L:D) h. Midguts were dissected from second day fifth instar larvae, and either immediately used to prepare BBMVs or stored at -80\u00b0C. BBMVs were prepared according to Ferre et al. (1991) and stored in 0,3 M mannitol, 5 mM EGTA, 17 mM Tris-C1, pH 7.5, at -80\u00b0C until needed.\n\nThe affinity purification method of Knight et al. (1994) was adapted to CryIC toxin with modifications. CryIC toxin (10 mg) was coupled to 3 ml of cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B in 20 mM Na2CO3, pH 9.6, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). The gel was re-suspended in 20 mM Na2CO3, pH 9.6, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM EGTA, 0.1% 3-[(cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1 -propane-sulphonate (CHAPS) (buffer A) and stored at 4\u00b0C. BBMV (15 mg) was solubilized in 10 ml of 1% CHAPS in buffer A containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF), 4 /xM leupeptin, 10 txM aprotinin, and 100 /xM pepstatin A, at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. The sample was centrifuged at 100 000 xg at 4\u00b0C for 1 h and the supernatant applied to 3 ml of CryIC toxin affinity column. The gel-BBMV mixture was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with gentle rotation. After washing with 200 ml of buffer A, bound proteins eluted with 5 ml of 1 M NaSCN in buffer A. The eluate was immediately diluted to 10 ml with buffer A and then concentrated to 0.2 ml using a Centriprep-30 ultra-filtration device (Amicon) at 4\u00b0C. The sample was either used for analysis by SDS-PAGE or stored at -20\u00b0C. Protein amounts were measured by Bio-Rad or BCA protein assay (for samples containing detergents) using bovine serum albumin as a standard.\n\nToxin purification B. thuringiensis strains were grown at 28\u00b0C in 1/2strength L-broth until sporulation and cell lysis. Toxin was purified by a modified procedure of Luo and Adang (1994) . Protoxin was released from the crystal-spore\n\nBBMVs (15 mg) were solubilized in 20 mM MES buffer, pH 5.5, containing 2% Polyoxyethylene 23 lauryl ether (Brij 35) at 4\u00b0C for 30 rain and centrifuged at 785 27 000 xg for 60 rain to remove insoluble materials. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.2 /~m filter (Nalge) and the sample loaded onto a DE 52 column (1.5\u00d715 cm) pre-equilibrated with 20 mM MES, pH 5.5, containing 0.1% Brij 35. Column flow-through containing 106 kDa protein was dialysed against 20 mM Tris-HC1, pH 8.0, containing 0.1% Brij 35 (buffer B). The dialysed sample was incubated at 60\u00b0C for 30 rain, and then centrifuged at 27 000 xg for 30 rain and filtered through a 0.2 /zm filter prior to separation using a Mono Q column pre-equilibrated with buffer B. Proteins were eluted with 0-600 mM NaC1 gradient in buffer B, analysed by SDS-PAGE and fractions containing 106 kDa protein stored at -80\u00b0C.\n\nBBMVs were solubilized with 1% CHAPS in 20 mM Tris-HC1, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 27 000 \u00d7g for 60 rain. The supernatant was loaded onto an Econo Pac Q column pre-equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HC1, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% Brij 35 (buffer C), and bound proteins eluted with a 0-600 mM NaC1 gradient in the same buffer. Fractions containing 120 kDa protein were collected and dialysed against buffer C. The resulting material was re-fractionated on a Mono Q column in buffer C. The 115 kDa APN was purified as described in Lu and Adang (1996) .\n\nPurified 106 kDa protein was labeled with Na125I using Iodobeads (Pierce) as described previously . Iodination of CryIAc was performed according to Garczynski et al. (1991) . Specific activity was 3.7 /xCi//~g and 20.5 /xCi//xg of input protein for the 106 kDa protein and CryIAc, respectively.\n\nIndirect immunoprecipitation was done according to Oddou et al. (1991) with modifications. Anti-CryIC antiserum (10 /xl) was incubated with 200 /~1 of protein A-Sepharose 4B equilibrated at room temperature for 1 h. After three washes with buffer A, CryIC toxin (50 /~g) was added, and then the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The toxin-anti-toxin-bead complex was washed three times with buffer A and then mixed with CHAPS-solubilized BBMV (100 /~g) or 1251-106 kDa protein (105 cpm). The mixture was incubated at 4\u00b0C for 2 h with rotation. After three washes with buffer A, radioactivity in the binding protein-toxinantiserum complex was measured on a Beckman Gamma 4000 counter, and then the binding protein-toxin-antiserum complex was dissociated from the beads by heating in SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 100\u00b0C for 5 rain and analysed by 10% SDS-PAGE. In control experiments, precipitation was performed as described above except that CryIC toxin or anti-CryIC antiserum was omitted. Precipitation was also carried out in the presence of various concentrations of GalNAc or GlcNAc and APN inhibitors (see legend to Fig. 6 ).\n\nSDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (1970) . Non-denaturing PAGE was performed according to Soutar and Wade (1989) using the gel electrophoresis conditions described in Lu and Adang (1996) . Ligand blotting was performed as described in Garczynski et al. (1991) .\n\nPurified 106 kDa protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto PVDF membrane. The 106 kDa protein was partially digested with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease according to Cleveland et al. (1977) . The digested peptides were separated by SDS-PAGE, and then blotted to PVDF membrane. The blotted filter was stained with amido black and stained bands were excised and submitted for amino acid sequencing, as described by Sangadala et al. (1994) .\n\nAPN activity was assayed using L-leucine-p-nitroanilide (LpNA) as substrate as described by Garczynski and Adang (1995) . APN activity staining of non-denaturing gels was according to Ward (1975) . L-leucine-/3-naphthylamide was freshly prepared as a 0.5 M stock solution in 95% ethanol then diluted to 5 mM in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. The non-denaturing gel was immersed in 5 mM L-leucine-/3-naphthylamide for 5 min and bands were visualized with 0.15% fast garnet GBC in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0.\n\nPurified 106 kDa protein (1 /xg) was digested with 1 unit of PIPLC at 30\u00b0C for l h and then separated by SDS-PAGE. After transfer onto nitrocellulose membrane, the presence of a cleaved GPI group was detected using a polyclonal antibody against a cross-reacting determinant (CRD) of GPI anchored proteins as described in Garczynski and Adang (1995) (anti-CRD sera was kindly provided by K. Mensa-Wilmot, University of Georgia).\n\nCryIC toxin affinity chromatography was used to purify a toxin binding protein from M. sexta midgut brush border membranes. CHAPS-solubilized BBMV were applied to the CryIC affinity column, and bound proteins were eluted with 1 M NaSCN. Fig. 1 (Lane 5) shows a 106 kDa protein that was present in the eluate. A considerable amount of 106 kDa protein was also visible in Lane 4 (not bound). The purification of a 106 kDa protein was not expected, based on previous studies identifying a 40 kDa CryIC binding protein in several insect species. CryIC toxin from the column and a slight amount of a 115 kDa protein were also present in the eluate. Our previous experience in purifying the 115 kDa CrylAc binding protein suggested that conventional chromatography can be more efficient than CryIC affinity columns (Lu and Adang, 1996) . We developed an alternative method combining heat treatment and conventional chromatographies to isolate the 106 kDa protein. Solubilized BBMV were passed through a DE 52 column at pH 5.5, a condition where most proteins, but not the 106 kDa protein, bound to the column [ Fig. I(B) , Lane 3]. Since Hajjou and Le Gal (1994) and Klinkowstrom et al. (1994) reported aminopeptidase was heat stable at, 50-60\u00b0C, we included a 60\u00b0C treatment of the DE 52 column flow-through that eliminated most background BBMV proteins [ Fig. I(B) , Lane 3]. The original stained gel showed the contaminating proteins more clearly. After a second ion-exchange chromatography (Mono Q) at pH 8.0, we obtained a 106 kDa protein visible as a single band on SDS-PAGE [ Fig. I(B) , Lane 2].\n\nIndirect immunoprecipitation was used to verify that the 106 kDa protein isolated by conventional chromatography was a CryIC binding protein. CryIC bound to anti-CryIC Sepharose precipitates a 106 kDa protein from CHAPS-solubilized BBMV [ Fig. 2(A) , Lane 1]. The same CryIC precipitation was performed with 125I-labeled 106 kDa protein. Precipitates were counted in a gamma counter then analysed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography showing that the labeled 106 kDa protein bound to CryIC [ Fig. 2(B) , Lane 2]. Approximately 16% of the input ~251-106 kDa protein was precipitated. To test the specificity of toxin binding we performed the same experiment using ~251-106 kDa protein and CryIAc toxin-anti-CryIAc Sepharose beads. In this case less than 5% of the labeled protein was precipitated, and a faint band was visible on the autoradiograph [ Fig.  2(B) , Lane 3]. When anti-CryIC antiserum was omitted from the precipitation step, only a trace of ~251-106 kDa protein was detected [ Fig. 2(B) , Lane 4]. The 106 kDa protein purified by conventional chromatography was used in subsequent experiments.\n\nSince CryIAc toxin binds to the PIPLC cleaved soluble 115 kDa form of APN (Garczynski and Adang, 1995; Lu and Adang, 1996) , we were concerned that the 106 and 115 kDa proteins were isoforms of the same molecules. We compared the migration of purified 115 kDa APN, 106 kDa protein and the membrane bound 120 kDa APN by SDS-PAGE [ Fig. 3(A) ] and 12Sl-CryIAc ligand blotting [ Fig. 3(B) ]. Each protein had a unique migration pattern and t251-CryIAc toxin recognized only the 120 and 115 kDa proteins, but not the 106 kDa protein [ Fig. 3(B) , Lane 3].\n\nThe 106 kDa protein had an N-terminus of DPAYRLPTTT. This amino acid sequence is nearly identical to the N-terminus of DPSYRLPTTT of the 120 kDa (Sangadala et al., 1994; Knight et aL, 1994) and processed 115 kDa APN (Lu and Adang, 1996) . The sequencing result was confirmed by testing for aminopeptidase activity. The 106 kDa protein hydrolysed LpNA with a specific activity of 48.61 /.tmol/min/mg, representing a 19.3-fold enrichment compared to M. sexta crude BBMV (Table 1 ). The APN activity of the 106 kDa protein was inhibited by amastatin and EDTA. Garczynski and Adang (1995) demonstrated that the 120 kDa CryIAc-binding APN has an intact C-terminal GPI anchor. In the 115 kDa APN, this GPI anchor was cleaved. The 106 kDa APN was tested for a GPI anchor by probing a filter blot of PIPLC-treated and untreated 106 kDa APN with anti-CRD antibody. Anti-CRD antibody detects the modified inositol product generated by PIPLC cleavage. As shown in Fig. 4 , both PIPLC-treated and untreated 106 kDa APN reacted with the anti-CRD antibody [ Fig. 4(B) , Lane 2], indicating that 106 kDa APN has a GPI anchor and the anchor has been precleaved.\n\nThe 106 and 115 kDa APN molecules both have cleaved GPI anchors, yet bind CrylC and CryIAc, respectively. We used non-denaturing PAGE to reveal physical differences between purified APNs. The 120 kDa APN with an intact anchor was included for comparison. The gel stained for APN activity [ Fig. 5 activity (panel B). These fast-migrating species may be degradation products of the 106 kDa protein.\n\nThe differences between 106 and 115 kDa APNs were further analysed by peptide mapping and internal amino acid sequence analysis. Both proteins were digested by V8 protease and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The peptide mapping results showed different band patterns for the two APNs (data not shown). The N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined for the three largest peptides from the digested 106 kDa APN sample. The N-termini of the 70, 60 and 45 kDa peptides were QNMIALE. This sequence is not present in the published M. sexta APN sequence (Knight et al., 1995) . Based on these data, we conclude that the 106 and 115 kDa are isoforms of APN that differ in physical, structural and toxin-binding characteristics.\n\nSince an amino sugar side chain (GalNAc) is involved in CryIAc binding to 120/115 kDa APNs Garczynski and Adang, 1995; Knowles et al., 1991) , we tested for amino sugar involvement in CryIC binding. Unlike CryIAc affinity chromatography of the 115 kDa APN, the 106 kDa APN could not be eluted from the CryIC column by GalNAc (data not shown). Neither GalNAc or GlcNAc significantly reduced CryIC binding to J251-106 kDa protein in the indirect immunoprecipitation assay [ Fig. 6(A) , Lanes 3 and 4].\n\nWe also investigated whether the binding of CryIC toxin was to the active site of the 106 kDa APN. Toxin precipitation of ~251-106 kDa APN was performed in the presence or absence of amastatin and EDTA. While both inhibitors greatly reduced APN activity (Table 1 ) , neither inhibitor significantly decreased CryIC binding to the 106 kDa APN [ Figure 6 (B), Lane 3 and 4]. Figure 6 (B) (Lane 5) is a negative control showing when CryIC toxin was omitted, 1251-106 kDa protein was not precipitated by anti-CryIC antiserum Sepharose beads. .

Reaction with anti-CRD serum indicates that a GPI anchor has been cleaved by PIPLC.\n\nCrylC binding enhances aminopeptidase activi~'\n\nCrylC was added in the concentration range 0-500 nM to LpNA assay mixture containing either 106 kDa APN, 115 kDa APN or porcine microsomal APN (Fig. 7) . The relative 106 kDa APN activity increased with increasing concentration of CryIC toxin up to 20 nM. A further increase in toxin above 80 nM lowered the enzyme activity. We tested the same amounts of CryIAc toxin with the three APNs and detected enhancement of 115 kDa APN activity as reported previously (Sangadala et al., 1994) . There was some enhancement of 106 kDa APN activity by CryIAc. The effect of BSA was negligible relative to the stimulatory effects of CryIC on 106 kDa APN and CryIAc on 115 kDa APN activity. effect on CrylC toxin binding. CrylC toxin enhances enzyme activity in the nanomolar toxin range. The 106 kDa APN was also shown to have a cleaved GPI anchor. Previous studies showed that CrylC recognized a 40 kDa protein in three Spodoptera species and Heliothis virescens (Oddou et al., 1993; Sanchis and Ellar, 1993) . The difference between our results and prior studies may be due to several factors. (A) CrylC binding proteins may differ between insect species. (B) Previous investigations of CrylC binding studies were based on ligand blotting. We were unsuccessful using this technique either with ~25 I-labeled CrylC toxin or anti-CrylC antibody detection. (C) It is possible a 40 kDa binding protein was not solubilized. We believe that was not the case, since previous investigators also used CHAPS for BBMV solubilization (Sanchis and Ellar, 1993) . (D) The CrylC binding APN in the previous studies may have been partially degraded. Additional studies are needed to resolve apparent differences in CrylC binding proteins across insect taxa.\n\nAPN is an exopeptidase which preferentially cleaves peptides with N-terminal neutral amino acids (Kenny et al. , 1987) . The N-termini of most activated CryI toxins are neutral amino acids such as leucine and isoleucine (Hofte and Whiteley, 1989; Luo and Adang, unpublished data) . One possibility is that APN binding to CryI toxins may be a consequence of the enzyme's N-terminal trimming reaction following endoprotease cleavage. Sangadala et al. (1994) and Knight et al. (1994) argued against this model and proposed that CrylAc toxin binds elsewhere on the APN. In this study, we showed that amastatin, a competitive active-site inhibitor, did not block CrylC binding to 106 kDa APN (Fig. 6) , suggesting that the toxin does not bind to the active site. A more complicated explanation of the amastatin experiment involves a consideration of how toxin binding activates APN. CrylC and CrylAc binding to 106 kDa and 115 kDa APN molecules enhanced enzymatic activity against LpNA (Fig.  7) . This agrees with our previous study of CrylAc and 120 kDa APN (Sangadala et al., 1994) . Toxin-induced enzyme enhancement may be analogous to the effect cer-tain peptide inhibitors have on microsomal aminopeptidase. Certain analogs of APN inhibitors stimulate rather than decrease enzymatic activity (Taylor, 1993) . DiGregorio et al. (1988) explains this unexpected activation as due to the existence of two substrate binding sites in close proximity on APN. Cryl toxin binding to APN may alter the fit of LpNA into the active site. This could be due to binding of the toxin's N-terminus at an active site or near the active site. Similarly, a swine-specific coronavirus uses intestinal APN as an adventitious receptor without involving the enzyme's active site (Delmas et al., 1994) . GalNAc is part of the structure on the 120/115 kDa APN recognized by CryIAc toxin (Garczynski et al., 1991; Knowles et al., 1991; Lu and Adang, 1996) , but this amino sugar is not involved in CryIC binding to the 106 kDa protein [ Fig. 6(A) ]. This result is similar to those obtained by Masson et al. (1995) showing that Gal-NAc blocks CryIAc, but not CrylAa and CryIAb binding to 115 kDa APN. CryIC may interact with an unidentified sugar residue on 106 kDa APN, based on a recent paper by Shimizu et al. (1994) . The authors proposed that the unusual 'Greek key' structure of CryIIIA domain II (Li et al., 1991) is folded like vitelline membrane protein I from hens' eggs. This unusual folding pattern is also present in CryIAa toxin and probably a conserved topology of CryI toxins (Grochulski et al., 1995) . Vitelline membrane protein I reportedly can bind epithelial cells and has oligosaccharide transferase activity (Shimizu et al., 1994) .\n\nThree forms of APN have been identified in M. sexta. Garczynski and Adang (1995) showed that the 120 kDa membrane-bound form is released as a soluble 115 kDa form by PIPLC treatment. Lu and Adang (1996) showed an endogenous PIPLC makes the same conversion in solubilized BBMV. Since the 106 kDa form has a cleaved GPI anchor, M. sexta PIPLC is also acting on the membrane-bound form of the 106 kDa APN. We have not yet determined the molecular size of the 106 kDa APN with the intact GPI anchor.\n\nThe 106 and 115 kDa soluble aminopeptidases share common features yet have fundamental differences. Common features included: the similarity of their N-termini; both APN forms are attached to the membrane via a GPI anchor, and both forms have high LpNA activity (48.6 /xmol/min/mg for the 106 kDa APN compared to 70.4 p~mol/min/mg for 115 kDa APN). Toxin binding is the obvious distinguishing feature: 106 kDa APN binds CryIC and not CryIAc, while the 115 kDa APN binds CryIAc and not CryIC. Also, their migrations are slightly distinguishable by SDS-PAGE. However, non-denaturing PAGE revealed distinct mobilities for the 115 and 106 kDa APNs (Fig. 5) . The internal sequence for the 106 kDa protein was not present in a published APN sequence (Knight et al., 1995) . Based on these data, we conclude that the 106 and 115 kDa proteins are isoforms of APN. Multiple aminopeptidase isoforms in insects have been described (Klinkowstrom et al., 1994; Ferreira et al., 1994) , but these proteins have not been isolated or characterized in detail.\n\nThe molecular basis of isoforms is well studied for a few proteins (Fishman, 1990) . The diversity of alkaline phosphatases in rats arises from two genes for individual isozymes being differentially regulated in intestinal tissue (Engle and Alpers, 1992) and expressed as membranebound forms attached via a GPI linkage (Engle et al., 1995) . Another factor in isozyme diversity is that the native translation products of two genes can be similar in molecular size, but due to slight differences in amino acid sequence, the proteins are glycosylated in dramatically different ways (Engle et al., 1995) . In the case of M. sexta, we favor a hypothesis that two mRNA encode the related APN molecules, based on the peptide sequence from the 106 kDa protein not being present in the published sequence. This conclusion is also supported by the physical properties (including different heat stability and mobility on non-denaturing PAGE) of the 106 and 115 kDa proteins.\n\nThe successful purification of the CryIC-binding APN, and its identification as an isoform unique from the CryIA-binding APN, will facilitate future comparative studies of these CryIA and CryIC receptors. An understanding of the mechanisms in insects which produce multiple APNs may clarify the complicated relationship between ~5-endotoxins and susceptible lepidopteran larvae."}
