These included the use of crude vaccines made up of soluble products of virus infected cells Mathes et al., 1981) , whole live or dead FeLV infected tumor cells , Jarrett et al., 1975 , 1976 Olsen et al., 1976) , inactivated whole FeLV Olsen et al., 1977; Pedersen et al., 1978; Yohn et al., 1976) , live virus (Hardy, 1981; Pedersen et al., 1978) , and viral envelope subunit proteins (Salerno et al., 1978) . The efficacy of these various vaccines was tested by measuring for the acquisition of virus neutralizing antibodies (Salerno et al., 1978) , by challenging cats with fibrosarcoma virus preparations Olsen et al., 1977; Yohn et al., 1976) or virulent FeLV (Hardy, 1981; Hoover et al., 1977; Jarrett et al., 1975 Jarrett et al., , 1976 , or by contact exposure with chronically infected cats (Pedersen et al., 1978) . Some of these vaccines have protected cats against infection with virulent virus, while others have not.\n\nThe present emphasis of most FeLV vaccine research is on genetically engineered viral subunit proteins, either in the form of bacterial or yeast expressed products or synthetic oligopeptides. Among the various virus structural proteins, the 70,000 dalton envelope glycoprotein has been thought to be responsible for evoking protective in%~]nity in cats (Hardy, 1981; Salerno et al., 1978) . In mice, marine leukemia virus gp71 covalently linked to its 15,000 dalton transenvelope anchoring protein (gp71-pl5E or gp85) has been shown to he even more immunogenic than gp71 alone (Hunsmann et al 1981) . Using genetic engineering, all or parts of these proteins can be synthesized by bacteria or yeast, or chemically produced as small i~nunogenic polypeptides containing pertinent antigenic epitopes (Lerner, 1983; Nunberg et al., 1984) .\n\nThere is some previous experience with retrovirus subunit vaccines. coworkers (1975, 1981) have inm~nized mice against Friend marine leukemia virus using purified viral envelope proteins gp71 or gp85 complexes. A similar preparation, FeLV-gp85, has been used to immunize cats against Snyder-Theilen fibrosarcoma virus (ST-FeSV) induced tumors (Hunsmann et al., 1983) . Feline leukemia virus-gp85 was immunogenic in cats, and inm~mized cats developed smaller tumors than non-vaccinated animals. No data was presented, however, on the retroviremia that accompanied tumor growth. Salerno and associates (1978) , failed to induce neutralizing antibodies in cats with a dose of purified FeLV-gp70 that produced good neutralizing antibody titers in guinea pigs. The efficacy of this vaccine against virulent FeLV challenge exposure was not tested, however.\n\nIt is essential for the success of genetically engineered subunit FeLV vaccines to first determine whether native viral subunits are imaunogenic in themselves, and more importantly, whether cats immunized with native viral subunit proteins are protected against virulent FeLV challenge exposure. It was for these reasons that the following experiments were conducted. In these experiments cats were immunized with inmLmoaffinity colunn purified FeLV-gp70 or chemically purified FeLV-gp85 and then challenged in various ways with virulent FeLV or FeSV. As controls for these studies, cats were either left unimmunized, or were vaccinated with formalin inactivated purified whole FeLV. Formalin inactivated whole FeLV vaccines have previously been shown by our laboratory to be effective irmmmogens in preventing persistent FeLV infection following natural exposure (Pedersen et al., 1978) . Experimental studies reported herein indicated that infection with virulent FeLV may have been actually enhanced by preimmunization with FeLV-gp70 or -gp85 vaccines in challenge-exposure situations where inactivated whole FeLV vaccines were protective.\n\nKittens 9 to 14 weeks of age were obtained from the specific pathogen The Kawakami-Theilen strain of FeLV was produced by cultures of FL74 feline ly~phoblastoid oells (Theilen et al., 1969) . This strain is in actuality a mixture of subgroup A, B, and C viruses (Sarma et al., 1973) .\n\nThe Snyder-Theilen strain of FeLV (ST-FeLV) was isolated from a cat that remained retroviremic after having recovered from a tumor induced by the ST-feline sarcoma virus (ST-FeSV) . Buffy ooat oells from the blood of this cat were cocultivated with primary fibrcblasts cells and the resulting infected culture was designated FF280/ST-FeLV.\n\nST-FeLV is the naturally occurring helper virus present in ST-FeSV stocks and belongs to the interference subgroup B (Sarma et al., 1973) . The ST-FeLV isolate is nontransforming to normal feline fibroblasts and does not induce fibrosarcomas. The CT600 strain of FeLV (CT600-FeLV) was a naturally occurring subgroup A retrovirus isolated from a leopard cat that lived in the same household as FeLV infected domestic cats (Rasheed et al., 1981) . The virus is replicated in a chronic fashion by CT600 leopard cat testicle cells. The Rickard strain of FeLV (R-FeLV) (Rickard et al., 1969) was originally obtained as a cell-free tumor homogenate from Dr. Richard Olsen, Ohio State University. This isolate has been classified as subgroup A (Sarma et al, 1973 FeLV-gp70, -P27 and -PI5E assays All three of these FeLV structural proteins were quantitiated by a double sandwich type enzyme linked inmlznosorhent assay (ELISA). The assay procedure for FeLV-p27 was identical to that described by Lutz and coworkers (1983) . Similar assays were used for the quantitation of FeLV -gp70 and -pl5E. The FeLV-gp70 assay utilized polyclonal goat anti-FeLV -gp70 ~oglobulin (NIH 815-210) for the \"catcher\" and monoclonal mouse anti-FeLV-gp70 (25-5D) IgG conjugated to horse radish peroxidase (HPASE)\n\nfor the second antibody. The ELISA for FeLV-pI5E utilized monoclonal mouse anti FeLV-pI5E (29-2C) IgG as the \"catcher\" and monoclonal mouse anti-FeLV -plSE (29-22) IgG conjugated to HPASE as the second antibody. The IgG fraction was purified from serum or ascites fluid by the procedure of Bruck and coworkers (1982) . These assay procedures were used to follow FeLV-gp70 through various steps in purification to assure its separation from\n\nFeLV-p27 and -pI5E. The FeLV-p27 assay was also used to detect virus in the blood of FeLV infected cats .\n\nPurification of FeLV-gp70\n\nFeLV-gp70 was prepared from KT-FeLV, ST-FeLV, and CT600-FeLV using Lmmunoaffinity ~olumn chromatography. Virus containing cell culture supernatants were clarified of particulate debris by low speed centrifugation and then concentrated 40 fold on a Milipore Pellicon apparatus.\n\nVirus was pelleted at 18,000 rpm's for 120 min. in a Beckman Type 21 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). Pelleted virus was resuspended in a small amount of TEN buffer (0.1 M tris, 0.001 M edta, 0.i M NaCI, pH 7.2), and then placed over a 10-50% continuous sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 25,000 rpm for 4 hr in a Beckman SW27 rotor. Gradient fractions were collected and assayed for FeLV-gp70 by ELISA; fractions oontaining the largest anounts of this protein were saved (Fig i) . FIGURE 1 -Continuous i0 to 50% sucrose gradient purification of FeLV pelleted from concentrated and clarified tissue culture media. FeLV-gp70 protein, as determined by an ELISA assay, was concentrated near the 1.16 g/ml region of the gradient and corresponded with the area where whole virions banded.\n\nVirus was removed from sucrose by diluting gradient fractions I:I0 with TEN buffer and reultracentrifugation. Pellets were resuspended in TEN buffer containing 0.1% Triton. Triton disrupted virus was then passed over an inmlmoaffinity colLmm. Immunoaffinity columns were made according to the procedure of Cuatrecases (1971) using cyanogen bromide activated sepharose-4B and mouse monoclonal IgG against 3 different epitopes of FeLV-gp70\n\n(monoclonal antibodies 25-5D, I-3B, and I-3C). Nonbinding proteins were washed through the coltmms with large volumes of TEN buffer until the eluting material was free of FeLV-p27 (Fig. 2) . FI(~/RE 2 -Immunoaffinity column purification of FeLV-gp70. The column was made of sepharose 4B covalently linked to anti-FeLV-gp70 mouse monoclonal IgG. The starting material on the column was detergent disrupted whole FeLV. FeLV-p27 appeared in the colunm wash-through, and when the wash buffer was free of this protein, the 3M KSCN gradient was started. FeLV-gp70 eluted between 1 and 2M KSCN.\n\nFeLV-gp70 was then eluted with a continuous gradient of 0 to 3M sodium thiocyanate in 50 mM borate buffer, pH 8.5. The resulting eluate fractions were then assayed for FeLV-gpT0 and fractions containing the greatest amounts of this material were pooled (Fig. 2) . The FeLV-gpT0 rich eluate was then desalted on a Sephadex G25 column equilibrated with 50 ram ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.5.\n\nPurification of FeLV-gp85 ~settes made up of covalently linked FeLV envelope proteins gp70 and pl5E were produced from KT-FeLV by the procedure described by B/nsmann and coworkers (1983), and Schneider and associates (1980) . Rosettes were assayed by SDS-PAQ~, and a major protein band was demonstrated by Coomassie blue stain at 85,000 daltons. When rosettes were run on reducing gels (Laemmli, 1970) , the 85,000 dalton protein was reduced to a 70,000 (gp70) and 15,000/ 17,500 (pl5E) dalton protein.\n\nSerum antibodies to whole FeLV and FeLV-gp70 were measured by an ELISA procedure in 96 well microtiter plates (Imulon I, Dynatech Laboratories, Inc., Alexandria, VA). Wells were coated for 3 hr at 37 C with either 250 ng of gradient purified 5% sodium dodecylsulphate disrupted FeLV, 25 ng of inm~inoaffinity col~ purified FeLV-gp70, or 25 ng of purified FeLV-gp85, in 0.1M Na2CO3coating buffer, pH 9.6. Serum to be tested was diluted 1:200 (whole FeLV) or 1:8 (FeLV-gpT0 or -gp85) in tris-edta saline buffer with 0.05% tween 20 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. Diluted serum was incubated in the antigen coated wells for 1 hr at 37 C. After washing, a 1:500 dilution of rabbit anti-cat IgG horse radish peroxidase conjugate (Cappel Laboratories, Cochranville, PA) was allowed to react for 45 min.\n\nWells were then washed and the enzymatic reactions carried out with ABTS.\n\nColor reactions were read on a Dynatech microELISA reader (Dynatech Laboratories, Inc., Alexandria, VA). Optical density readings were standardized to a known positive and negative serum included in each test run.\n\nVirus neutralizing antibodies were measured by an infectivity inhibition assay. Subconfluent monolayers of Crandell feline kidney (Crfk) cells were established in 96 well microtiter plates. One hundred tissue culture infectious doses 100% (i00 TCIDI00) of KT-or CT600-FeLV in 0.05 ml of tissue culture media was incubated for 1 hr at 37 C with an equal volume of a serial two-fold dilution of the test cat serum starting at I:i0. Specific pathogen free cat serum was used as a negative control and goat anti-FeLV serum as a positive control. After incubation the serum-virus mixture was overlayered onto the Crfk cell monolayers and then incubated for 24 hours. At this time the media was completely changed.\n\nTissue culture supernatants were harvested on day 7 and assayed for\n\nFeLV-p27 antigen. The titer of virus neutralizing antibody in a given serum was scored as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum that completely suppressed the expression of FeLV-p27.\n\nThe i~unogenecity of purified FeLV-gp70 and -gp85 was tested by ELISA. \n\nTwo different basic challenge systems were used to test the efficacy of the various vaccine preparations. In the first system, cats were inoculated subcutaneously between the shoulder blades with 5 x 106 FF64, 90/ST-FeSV cells. This cell line was a primary feline fibroblast culture that had been productively transformed with ST-FeSV . Fibrosarcomas appeared at the site of inoculation within 6 days, concurrently with a systemic retrovirus infection. The systemic retroviremia has been shown to be due almost exclusively to the FeLV helper virus present in ST-FeSV transformed cells (deNoronha et al., 1983; . Vaccine protection in this system is measured by 3 criteria, i) reduction of maximum tumor size (Hunsmann et al., 1983) , 2) a decrease in the proportion of cats that developed progressively growing and fatal fibrosarcomas, and 3) a decrease in the proportion of infected cats that developed a persistent FeLV helper viremia during the course of tumor growth or after tumor regression .\n\nIn the second challenge system, cats were inoculated oronasally with 40,000 focus forming units (ffu's) of CT600-FeLV every other day for 8 days, or similarly with 400,000 ffu's of R-FeLV. The CT600-FeLV was propagated in leopard cat testicle cells (Rasheed et al., 1981) , and R-FeLV was propagated in fc9 feline fibroblast. Virus was titrated by the focus formation procedure of Fischinger and associates (1974). In this system, vaccine protection was measured by a decrease in the proportion of cats that were still viremic 12 to 16 weeks post challenge (Pedersen et al., 1977) . Retroviremia was measured weekly using an ELISA procedure for the detection of FeLV-p27 .\n\nThe effect of vaccines on the post challenge-exposure incidence of persistent viremia was evaluated using relative odds ratios ( (Glantz, 1981) . With 1 degree of freedom, a X 2 of 3.84 or greater was considered to be significant at the 95% confidence level (P_< 0.05).\n\nFeLV-gp70 and -gp85 were analyzed for purity by inm~noblotting acording to the procedure of Towbin and associates (1979) , except that the enzymatic reaction was developed using 0.5 mg/ml of 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride monohydrate (Aldrich Chemicals, Milwaukee, WI) and 0.01% hydrogen peroxide in 0.i M tris saline buffer, pH 7.4. A single band at a molecular weight of 70,000 daltons was identified in both preparations using the 25-5D mouse monoclonal FeLV-gp70 antibody (Fig. 3) . FeLV-p27 was absent from both preparations, while only the FeLV-gp85 contained a 17,500 dalton band that reacted with the mouse monoclonal FeLV-pI5E antibodies.\n\nI Figure 3 -Irmnunoblots of PA(~ purified FeLV-gp85, detergent disrupted whole FeLV, FeLV-gpT0, and FeLV-p27. Mouse monoclonal antibodies were against FeLV-gpT0, -p27, and -pl5E. FeLV-gp85, when run under reducing conditions, demonstrated a major band with the FeLV-gpT0 monoclonal antibody at 70,000 daltons and a major band with the FeLV-plSE monoclonal antibody at 17,500 daltons. Irmm/ncblots of whole FeLV, when reacted with the anti-FeLV-gpT0, -p27, and-pl5E monoclonal reagents, demonstrated corresponding bands of reactivity at 70,000, 27,000 and 17,500 dalton regions respectively. FeLV-gp70 preparations were found to react only with FeLV-qpT0 monoclonal antibody, and were free of FeLV-p27 and -plSE. As a specificity control, FeLV-p27 was also tested by immunoblotting. FeLV-p27 was only detected by the corresponding FeLV-p27 monoclonal antibody.\n\nFeLV-gp70 and -gp85 were subjected to a number of physical and chemical insults during their purification. It was important, therefore, to deter-mine whether major antigenic epitopes were still intact. The major antigenic epitope of FeLV-gpT0 has been described by Nunberg and coworkers (1984) . This epitope was contained in a 14 amino acid region in the amino-terminal half of -gp70, and was recognized by the 25-5D monoclonal antibody. To determine whether this epitope was still intact, the purified FeLV-gpT0 and -gp85 were used as competitors for the binding of the peroxidase labeled 25-5D monoclonal antibody to whole FeLV in an ELISA assay.\n\nDetergent disrupted whole FeLV, FeLV-gpT0, and FeLV-gp85 all competed with the labeled monoclonal antibody for binding to the whole FeLV (Fig. 4) .\n\nThe purified FeLV-gp70 and -gp85 were also reacted in an ELISA against a battery of 7 different mouse monoclonal FeLV-gp70 antibodies and a goat polyclonal anti-FeLV-gpT0 serum (Table I) . Purified FeLV-gp70 and -gp85\n\nboth reacted with each of these antibodies. (Tables II, III \n\nFIGURE 5 -ELISA antibody titers in the serum of cats vaccinated with inactivated whole FeLV vaccine. The antibody responses of this group of animals was considered representative of the responses seen in the group as a whole. The upper graph depicts serum antibody levels against purified FeLV-gp70, while the lower graph depicts the antibody levels against whole detergent disrupted FeLV. Control cats did not develop appreciable ELISA antibody titers and were therefore not included.\n\nCats immunized with inactivated whole ST-FeLV vaccine, regardless of the experimental group, resisted virulent virus challenge to a greater degree than the control nonimmunized animals (Table II ). In the case of the 124 kittens challenged with ST-FeSV (Table If) Efficacy of FeLV-gp70 or -qp85 subunit vaccines Forty i0 to 12 week-old kittens were vaccinated with purified FeLV envelope proteins (Table V, Thirty-seven kittens served as nonvaccinated controls.\n\nCats immunized with various FeLV envelope proteins produced good serum antibodies against whole FeLV and FeLV-gp70 (or FeLV-gp85) as detected by ELISA (Figs. 6,7) . Virus neutralizing antibodies were not detected, however, in the serum of any of the vaccinated cats (data not shown). -ELISA antibody titers in the serum of cats vaccinated with immunoaffinity column purified FeLV-gp70. The antibody response of this group of animals was considered representative of the responses seen in the group as a whole. The upper graph depicts serum antibody levels against purified FeLV-gp70, while the lower graph depicts the antibody levels against whole detergent disrupted FeLV. Control cats did not develop appreciable ELISA antibody titers and were therefore not included.\n\nTwo weeks after completing their courses of immunization, subunit vacciD~ted cats and control animals were challenged with either FeLV or FeSV. Following inoculation with FeSV, both vaccinates and nonvaccinates developed fibrosareomas at the site of inoculation (Table IV) . The mean peak tumor size was always smaller in cats vaccinated with FeLV-gp70 or -gp85. Surprisingly, the proportion of cats that remained persistently FeLV-helper viremic following FeSV inoculation did not mirror the decreased tumor growth. Vaccinates remained persistently retroviremic following challenge-exposure at a higher rate than oontrol animals (8/20 vs 2/22, R =-6.7, X 2= 3.94, p= <0.05) (Table V) . Twenty FeLV -gp70 and -gp85 vaccinated and 15 nonvaccinated kittens were challenged oronasally with virulent FeLV (Table VI) . Following challenge-exposure, a greater proportion of vaccinated cats became persistently viremic as compared to nonvaccinates (13/20 vs 7/15, R=-2.1, X 2= 0.55, p> 0.5), although the difference by chi-square was not statistically significant. The upper graph depicts the antibody levels against purified FeLV-gp85, while the lower graph depicts the antibody titers against detergent disrupted whole FeLV. Nonvaccinated control cats did not develop appreciable antibody titers and were therefore not included.\n\nOverall, enhancement of persistent retroviremia by vaccination with purified FeLV envelope proteins was seen in 6/8 experimental groups (V33e,d; V42c,e; V49b; V50b). This was in contrast to the ii groups of cats that were vaccinated with inactivated whole FeLV vaccines, all of which showed a lower incidence of persistent viremia than nonvaccinates within the same experiments. Salerno and associates (1978) concluded that purified FeLV-gp70 was poorly immunogenic in cats because it induced antibodies detectable by radioi~aunoassay but little or no virus neutralizing or cytotoxic antibodies. Our experiments confirmed their findings; none of the cats that we immunized with either FeLV-gpT0 or -gp85 developed virus neutralizing antibodies, but serum antibodies detectable by ELISA were produced against both whole FeLV and FeLV-gp70.\n\nThe most surprising finding in our study was that cats vaccinated with\n\nFeLV-gp70 or -gp85 appeared to be more susceptible to infection with virulent FeLV or FeSV than nonvaccinated animals. This enhancement of infection was seen in 6/8 vaccine groups and was apparent whether cats were immunized with gpT0 or with gp85. It also occurred regardless of whether the challenge viruses were autologous or homologous to the strain of FeLV from which the purified envelope proteins were extracted. These findings were opposed, therefore, to the immunoprotective effect of viral envelope protein vaccines demonstrated for murine leukemia virus infection (HunEm~nn et al., 1975 (HunEm~nn et al., , 1981 , bovine leukemia virus infection of sheep (Onuma et al., 1984) , and foot-and-mouth disease of cattle (Bittle et al., 1982) .\n\nThe enhancing rather than protective effect of FeLV-gpT0, -gp85, vaccines could have been due to several mechanisms. First, it was possible that the procedures used to purify the proteins altered their antigenicity in such a way that neutralizing epitopes were no longer present. This seemed unlikely, however, because purified FeLV-gpT0 and -gp85 competed equally well with whole FeLV for binding to the 25-5D mouse monoclonal\n\nFeLV-gp70 antibody. This antibody recognizes the major neutralizing epitopes of the FeLV envelope protein (Nunberg et al., 1984) . In addition, purified FeLV-gp70 and -gp85 were immunoreactive in ELISA with 7 other virus neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibodies to FeLV-gp70 and with a highly specific goat polyclonal FeLV neutralizing antibody~ A second explanation for the possible enhancing effects of purified envelope protein vaccines was that they failed to induce the spectrum of inmlanity essential for protection, i.e., neutralizing antibodies as well as cellular im~snity. Neutralizing antibodies might be generated only as a result of exposure to larger envelope polyproteins (pre-cleavage products) present in inmature particles and on the cell membrane. The role of cellular immunity in FeLV infection is largely unknown. Passive transfer of immune sera will greatly inhibit the retroviremia that follows experimental infection in cats (deNorohna et al., 1980) , suggesting that humoral immunity is in~ortant in clearance of virus from the blood. Feline leukemia virus persists in the body as a latent infection, however, even in the face of strong humoral immunity . Cellular i~manity has been implicated in the ultimate clearance of such latent infections in other virus systems, and such i~nunity is hard to evoke with killed or subunit proteins.\n\nAs a third explanation, non-neutralizing antibodies to the envelope proteins might have either interfered with immunity or had an enhancing effect on virus infectivity and spread. Non-neutralizing antibodies might have bound to virus and sterically blocked the binding of virus neutralizing antibodies that were induced as a result of virulent virus challengeexposure (Massey and Schochetman, 1981) . Non-neutralizing antibodies may have acted as opsonins and enhanced the uptake of antibody coated virus by phagocytic cells. FeLV replicates initially in phagocytic cells in lymph nodes regional to the site of entry and spreads from these organs to other target tissues via blood borne mononuclear cells (Rojko et al., 1978) .\n\nBecause FeLV grows very well in mononuclear cells, and mononuclear cells migrate throughout the body, increased virus uptake by phagocytic cells could lead to both increased virus infectivity and dissemination. This scheme is not without precedence. Dengue virus infection of man can be enhanced by pre-existing humoral immunity to homologous serotypes of dengue virus or related flavivirus infections (Porterfield, 1982) . In a similar manner, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus infection can also be potentiated by pre-existing homologous coronavirus antibodies . Vaccination against FIP virus also makes the experimentally induced disease worse rather than better .\n\nA final possibility is that the envelope proteins acted as immunosuppresents rather than i.munogens. FeLV-pI5E has reportedly caused inmunosuppression both in vitro and in vivo (Mathes et al., 1979) . Cats that we immunized with FeLV-gp85 received both gp70 and plSE, and the plSE moiety may have enhanced the infectivity of the virulent FeLV challenge by virtue of its immunosuppressive effect. In support of this, it has been shown previously that FeLV-plSE, when given along with an FeLV vaccine, rendered cats more susoeptible to FeSV challenge than if they had received the vaccine alone (Mathes et al., 1979) . This phenomena does not, however, explain our findings, because cats immunized with FeLV-gp70 were as hypersensitive to infection as cats immmized with FeLV-gp85.\n\nThe obvious question raised by these findings is whether i~mmity to FeLV can be induced with FeLV-gp70 or -gp85 vaccines. If the current findings and those of Salerno and associates (Salerno et al., 1978) are universally applicable, then the answer seems to be no. It is possible, however, that FeLV-gp70 or -gp85 would induce protective immunity if given in some other form, at some other dose, or with other adjuvants. These possibilities cannot be answered without a great deal of additional research. The point that should not be overlooked, however, is that many researchers have placed great hopes on subunit vaccines produced by genetically engineered bacteria or yeast, or on synthetic oligopeptides.\n\nThese findings indicate that many problems and uncertainties exist with this approach, and that conventional inactivated whole virus vaccines should not be necessarily bypassed for the sake of more modern techniques.\n\nAlthough our FeLV-gp70 and -gp85 vaccines enhanced persistent retroviremia, they did significantly reduce the growth rate of retrovirus induced fibrosarcomas. Why anti-FeLV-gp70 or -gp85 inm~nity would protect against tumors yet enhance retroviremia is not immediately understandable.\n\nIt is known, however, that fibrosarcoma and retrovirus inm~nity are distinctly different phenomena (deNoronha et al., 1983; . A dichotomy between tumor and antivirus immunity in FeLV-gp70 or -gp85 vaccinated cats is not, therefore, incompatible with what is known about FeSV immunity.\n\nAlthough the current outlook for cheap and effective FeLV vaccines of recombinant or synthetic origin is somewhat clouded, it must be noted that conventional formalin inactivated whole virus vaccines worked very well.\n\nl%djuvanted and inactivated whole virus vaccines at a dose of 200 ml eq decreased the post-infection persistent viremia rate from 40 to 2% in our studies. This is c(mparable to the results of an earlier trial with a similar dose of antigen and natural contact challenge exposure (Pedersen et al., 1978) .\n\nThe fact that whole inactivated FeLV is both immtmogenic and induces protective immmity, while FeLV-gp70 and -gp85 are only immunogenic, indicates either that other proteins of the virus are responsible for protective immunity or that the envelope proteins are more favorably arrayed as immunogens on whole virus than as suspensions of pure protein.\n\nThe results of a previous study indicated that antibody to proteins in addition to FeLV-gp70 were also correlated with protection (Lutz et al., 1982) , thus supporting the first premise. In support of the latter possibility, FeLV virons are known to incorporate small amounts of me~rane proteins as they bud off of infected cells (Azocar et al., 1980) . These host proteins may enhance the immunogenecity of the viral proteins.\n\nAnother possiblity was that the dose of FeLV-gp70 or -gp85 used in these studies was lower than that present in 0.6 mg of whole FeLV. If about 13% of the viral proteins in whole FeLV was gp70, than 0.6 mg of whole virus would contain about 80 ug of gp70. We used 200 to 1000 mg of FeLV-gp70 or -gp85 per dose of vaccine in most of our experiments. It does not seem, therefore, that the difference in efficacy between whole virus and subunit protein vaccines was due to differences in the relative amounts of envelope protein in each.\n\nExperiments that seemed at firsthand to he contradictory to our own were recently reported by Osterhaus and coworkers (1985) . They were able to induce low levels of virus neutralizing antibodies in 6/8 young cats immunized with 3 doses of ~ostimulating complexes (iscoms) containing FeLV-gp70-85. Moreover, these cats seemed to be much more resistant to experimentally induced FeLV infection than nonvaccinated control animals.\n\nEven the authors, however, were careful not to ascribe the protective effect of the vaccine solely to its envelope protein content. Their iscoms were made from disrupted whole virus and they induced antibodies to a wide range of envelope and nonenvelope proteins. In effect, the studies of Osterhaus and associates (1985) reconfirmed our studies with whole virus vaccines. To prove that envelope proteins alone were responsible for the protective immunity demonstrated by iscom preparations, cats should be vaccinated with iscoms containing envelope proteins alone. If such preparations should prove as protective as iscoms made from whole virus, then we will have to concede that our experiences with envelope protein vaccines were jaded by the adjuvants that we used.
