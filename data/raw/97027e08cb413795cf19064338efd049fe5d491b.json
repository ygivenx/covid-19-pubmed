{"title": "Novel splicing and open reading frames revealed by long-read direct RNA sequencing of 1 adenovirus transcripts 2 3", "body": "polyadenylation sites have been characterized using low-throughput biochemical techniques or 23 short read cDNA-based sequencing, these technologies do not fully capture the complexity of the 24 adenoviral transcriptome. By combining Illumina short-read and nanopore long-read direct RNA 25 sequencing approaches, we mapped transcription start sites and cleavage and polyadenylation 26 sites across the adenovirus genome. The canonical viral early and late RNA cassettes were 27\n\nconfirmed, but analysis of splice junctions within long RNA reads revealed an additional 20 novel 28 viral transcripts. These RNAs include seven new splice junctions which lead to expression of 29 canonical open reading frames (ORF), as well as 13 transcripts encoding for messages that 30 potentially alter protein functions through truncations or the fusion of canonical ORFs. In addition, 31\n\nwe also detect RNAs that bypass canonical cleavage sites and generate potential chimeric 32\n\nIntroduction 36\n\nAdenoviruses (AdV) are common viral pathogens across multiple species with distinct 37 tissue tropisms including gut, eye, and lung [1] . Among the human adenoviruses, serotypes 2 38 (Ad2) and 5 (Ad5) from subgroup C are the most prevalent within the population, and they cause 39 benign to severe respiratory infections [2] . These two serotypes are highly homologous, sharing 40 94.7% nucleotide identity between their genomes and 69.2-100% amino acid identity amongst 41 conserved open reading frames (ORFs) [3, 4] . AdVs readily infect most transformed human cell 42 lines and have proven a valuable tool that has led to seminal discoveries in molecular biology for 43 many decades [5] . RNA splicing was discovered by the analysis of adenovirus encoded RNAs 44\n\n[6,7], as well as other important findings in messenger RNA capping and polyadenylation [8, 9] . It 45 is now understood that essentially all AdV mRNAs are capped, spliced, polyadenylated, and 46 exported from the nucleus using host cell machinery [10] . 47\n\nAdV are capable of infecting non-dividing cells and reprogramming cellular processes for 48 productive viral infection. This rewiring involves a highly regulated cascade of viral gene 49 expression over various kinetic classes [5] . The first viral gene to be expressed after infection is 50 E1A, a multi-functional transcription factor that activates downstream viral transcription, liberates 51 E2F from RB proteins, as well as alters host transcriptional responses to the virus [11] [12] [13] [14] . While 52 all E1A molecules have identical 5' and 3' nucleotide sequences, splicing of differently sized 53 internal introns allows for the production of discrete proteins that lack specific functional domains 54 conserved across serotypes [15] . Early after infection, E1A is expressed mainly as large and small 55 isoforms, but later in infection alternative splicing leads to the production of a 9 Svedberg E1A 56 isoform (E1A-9s) as well as low abundance doubly-spliced E1A-11s and E1A-10s. The second 57 viral gene to be activated is E1B, consisting of predominantly two spliced isoforms producing 19-58 kilodalton and 55-kilodalton proteins, with two less abundant isoforms generating putative ORFs 59 of 156 and 93 residues [16] . While E1B-19K acts to block cellular apoptosis [17] , E1B-55K is 60 polyadenylation sites leading to E3A and E3B transcription units, and these gene products are 69 primarily involved in modulating the host innate immune system [28] [29] [30] . Like E1A, the E4 region 70 on the reverse strand has identical 5' and 3' regions, and encodes up to six ORFs by removal of 71 a first intron of varying length. E4 region transcripts encode for multifunctional proteins that are 72 involved in regulation of transcription, splicing, and translation of viral RNAs, as well as 73\n\nantagonizing intrinsic cellular defenses [31] [32] [33] the quality and depth of current short-read sequencing technologies is high, the complex nature 117 of many viral transcriptomes precludes the unambiguous mapping of these short reads to any 118 one particular RNA isoform due to extreme gene density and overlapping transcriptional units 119 [55, 56] . In this regard, the ability of long-read RNA sequencing to map full-length transcripts has 120 the potential to revolutionize detection of divergent isoforms and multiply spliced RNA at the 121 single-molecule level [57] [58] [59] . 122\n\nIn this study, we have re-annotated the Ad5 genome and transcriptome using a 123 combination of short-read and long-read RNA sequencing technologies. The high read depth and 124 accuracy of base-calling achieved by Illumina-based short-read sequencing allowed for both the 125 detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms within transcriptionally active regions of the viral 126 DNA genome, as well as error-correction of the inherently noisier base-calling of Nanopore-based 127 long-read direct RNA sequencing (dRNA-seq). dRNA-seq enabled the detection of full-length 128 RNA transcripts and the assignment of TSS and CPAS transcriptome-wide. Furthermore, by 129 combining highly accurate splice site junctions from short-read sequencing and full-length isoform 130 context from long-read sequencing, we were able to reevaluate the splicing complexity of AdV The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.13.876037 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nTo compare short-read Illumina sequencing and long-read nanopore sequencing directly, 167 A549 cells were infected with Ad5 for 24 hours and total RNA was harvested in biological triplicate. 168\n\nFractions of these three samples were prepared into standard strand specific Illumina RNA-seq 169 libraries using the polyadenylated mRNA fraction. The same RNA samples were then poly(A) 170 purified before submitting to direct RNA sequencing (dRNA-seq) on an Oxford Nanopore Using full-length RNAs, we were able to detect novel splice sites producing canonical ORFs that 206 only differ in UTRs for L4-100K, L4-33K, L4-pVIII, and E4orf6/7. In addition, we discovered 207 canonical ORF isoforms embedded within transcripts generated from non-canonical promoters, 208 The complexity of the adenovirus transcriptome has not been fully explored using modern high-249 throughput technologies. Here we integrate short-read cDNA sequencing and long-read direct 250 RNA sequencing to re-annotate both the Ad5 DNA genome and RNA transcriptome. Using high 251 quality and high depth short-read sequencing, we were able to detect SNPs within the transcribed 252 regions of the genome approaching 100% penetrance, indicating that these sites were likely 253 present in the genome and not due to RNA editing or modifications. We recapitulated the known 254 TSS and CPAS sites throughout the Ad5 genome, and annotated novel splicing events within the 255 viral transcriptome. Of these 20 novel RNAs, 13 are likely to encode for altered ORFs including 256 multiple fusion transcripts that span transcriptional units thought previously to be distinct. Overall, 257\n\nwe have provided a more complete annotation of a complex viral transcriptome that highlights 258 potentially new gene products for future study. 259\n\nUsing RNA-seq data to call SNPs in viral DNA genomes is compelling since high quality \n\nAdenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) was originally purchased from ATCC. All viruses were 307 expanded on HEK293 cells, purified using two sequential rounds of ultracentrifugation in CsCl 308 gradients, and stored in 40% v/v glycerol at -20 \u00b0C (short term) or -80 \u00b0C (long term). Viral stock 309 titer was determined on HEK293 cells by plaque assay, and all subsequent infections were 310 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.13.876037 doi: bioRxiv preprint Total RNA from three biological replicates of Control knockdown or three biological 325 replicates of METTL3-knockdown A549 cells infected with Ad5 for 24 hours were sent to Genewiz 326 for preparation into strand-specific RNA-Seq libraries. Libraries were then run spread over three 327 lanes of an Illumina HiSeq 2500 using a 150bp paired-end protocol.
