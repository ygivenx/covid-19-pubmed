{"title": "Integrative QTL analysis of gene expression and chromatin accessibility identifies multi-tissue patterns of genetic regulation", "body": "Determining the mechanisms by which genetic variants drive molecular, cellular, and physiological phenotypes has proved to be challenging [1]. These mechanisms can be informed by genome-wide experiments that provide data on variations in molecular and cellular states in genotyped individuals. Most examples of such data, though, are largely observational, due in part to constraints of specific populations (e.g., humans), the limitations of existing experimental technologies, and the challenge of coordinating large numbers of experiments with multiple levels of data [2]. One approach to shed light on these dynamics is to pair complementary datasets from the same individuals and perform statistical mediation analysis (e.g., [3\u20135]), which has increasingly been used in genomics [6]. These analyses can identify putative causal relationships rather than correlational interactions, providing meaningful and actionable targets in terms of downstream applications in areas such as medicine and agriculture.\n\nIn human data, co-occurence of QTL across various multi-omic data has been used to assess potentially related and connected biological processes; examples include gene expression with chromatin accessibility [7] or regulatory elements [8], and ribosome occupancy with protein abundances [9]. More formal integration through statistical mediation analyses has also been used to investigate relationships between levels of human biological data, such as distal genetic regulation through local gene expression [10, 11], and eQTL with regulatory elements [12\u201314] and physiological phenotypes, such as cardiometabolic traits [15].\n\nThough genetic association studies of human populations have been highly successful [16], animal models allow for more deliberate control of confounding sources of variation, including experimental conditions and population structure, and as such provide a potentially powerful basis for detecting associations and even causal linkages. Towards this end, genetically-diverse mouse population resources have been established, including the Collaborative Cross (CC) [17\u201319] and the Diversity Outbred (DO) population [20]. The CC and the DO are multiparental populations (MPP), derived from the same eight founder strains (short names in parentheses): A/J (AJ), C57BL/6J (B6), 129S1/SvImJ (129), NOD/ShiLtJ (NOD), NZO/H1LtJ (NZO), CAST/EiJ (CAST), PWK/PhJ (PWK), and WSB/EiJ (WSB). The CC are recombinant inbred strains and therefore replicable across and within studies; the DO are largely heterozygous, outbred animals, bred with a random mating strategy that seeks to maximize diversity. MPPs similar to the CC or DO have also been developed in other species, including rats, Arabidopsis, Drosophila, and yeast, and the use of MPPs in model organism research has accelerated significantly in recent years ([21] and refs therein).\n\nAs with humans, it is only recently that studies on MPPs have used mediation analysis to connect genetic variants with different levels of genomic data. A genome-wide mediation approach in 192 DO mice was used to link transcriptional and post-translational regulation of protein levels [22]. CC mice were then used to confirm results by showing correspondence with estimates of founder haplotype effects from each of the related populations. More recently, mediation analysis was used to connect chromatin accessibility with gene expression in embryonic stem cells derived from DO mice [23]. The CC and DO, and MPPs more broadly, have well-characterized haplotype structures that provide a unique opportunity for studying mediation at the haplotype level. This is potentially advantageous because haplotypes can capture genetic variation and its effects more comprehensively than can individual SNPs [24], the latter being the predominant basis for comparable mediation analyses in humans.\n\nHere we use a sample composed of a single male mouse from 47 CC strains to investigate dynamics between gene expression and chromatin accessibility, as determined by Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq), in lung, liver, and kidney tissues. We detect QTL underlying gene expression and chromatin accessibility variation across the strains and assess support for mediation of the effect of eQTL through chromatin accessibility using a novel implementation of previous methods used in the DO [22]. Additionally, we detect gene mediators of distal-eQTL. These findings demonstrate the experimental power of the CC resource for integrative analysis of multi-omic data to determine genetically-driven phenotype variation, despite limited sample size, and provide support for continued use of the CC in larger experiments going forward.\n\nGene expression and chromatin accessibility were measured with RNA-seq and ATAC-seq assays, respectively, from whole lung, liver, and kidney tissues in one male mouse from each of 47 CC strains (Fig 1). (The use of only male mice was due to practical constraints; results for females may differ [22].) Each tissue has a distinct function and we expected those differences to be reflected in the data. This was borne out by principal components analysis (PCA) of each of the gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiles, which showed that the samples clearly clustered by tissue (S1 Fig).\n\nDifferential expression (DE) and differentially accessible region (DAR) analysis were performed between the three tissues (S1 Table) and revealed between 3,564\u20135,709 DE genes and 28,048\u201340,797 DARs (FDR \u2264 0.1). For both expression and chromatin accessibility, liver and kidney tissues were the most similar, whereas lung and liver were the most distinct, also seen in the PCA plots (S1 Fig). Pathway analyses showed many between-tissue differences related to metabolic and immune-related pathways (FDR \u2264 0.1), reflecting the distinct demands of each tissue. Energy metabolism pathways were more active in liver and kidney and immune-related pathways were more pronounced in lung, as expected. We compared the concordance between DE genes and DARs genome-wide and observed that most DE gene promoters do not show significant differences in chromatin accessibility (S2 Fig). In cases with significant variability in accessibility at the promoter of a DE gene, though, the vast majority agree in direction (i.e., higher expression with greater accessibility).\n\nThe impact of genetic variation on gene expression was evaluated by eQTL mapping. This was done at three levels of stringency and emphasis: 1) at the level of the local region of a gene, defined as within 10Mb of the gene transcription start site (TSS), and hereafter termed Analysis L; 2) at the level of the chromosome on which the gene is located (Analysis C); and 3) at the level of the genome (Analysis G) (details in Methods). After filtering out lowly expressed genes, the number of genes examined in eQTL mapping was 8401 for liver, 11357 for lung, and 10092 for kidney (UpSet plot [25] in S3A Fig).\n\nAnalysis L detected local-eQTL for 19.8% of genes tested in liver, 16.6% in lung, and 20.8% in kidney (S2 Table). Local-eQTL for most genes were observed in only one tissue (S4A Fig). Analysis C, which was more stringent, additionally detected intra-chromosomal distal-eQTL, while Analysis G, the most stringent, additionally detected inter-chromosomal distal-eQTL (S2 Table). Genomic locations of eQTL detected for each tissue, excluding the intra-chromosomal distal-eQTL detected by Analysis C, are shown in Fig 2A[top]. See S5 Fig and S3 Table for eQTL counts with FDR \u2264 0.2.\n\nTo determine genetic effects on chromatin structure, genomic regions were divided into \u223c300 base pair windows and analyses similar to eQTL mapping were used to detect chromatin accessibility QTL (cQTL). After filtering regions with low signal across most samples, the number of chromatin regions tested were 11448 in liver, 24426 in lung, and 17918 in kidney. The overlap in chromatin windows tested across tissues is described in S3B Fig. The differences in genes and chromatin regions tested within each tissue likely reflects both biological and technical factors that distinguish the tissue samples. Overall, there were substantially fewer cQTL detected compared with eQTL for all tissues (Fig 2A[bottom]; S4 and S5 Tables). As with eQTL, cQTL were more likely to be local than distal (66\u201494.1% local-cQTL for Analysis G; 75\u201490% local-cQTL for Analysis C).\n\nFor QTL detected on the same chromosome as the gene or chromatin region (intra-chromosomal), the strongest associations were observed within 10Mb of the gene TSS or chromatin window midpoint (Fig 2B and S6 Fig). Intra-chromosomal distal-QTL had reduced statistical significance, more consistent with inter-chromosomal distal-QTL. This dynamic between local- and distal-QTL is also observed when using the QTL effect size as a measure of strength, which is likely biased upward due to the Beavis effect in 47 strains [26], shown in Fig 2C and S7 Fig.\n\nFor all QTL we estimated the effects of the underlying (founder) haplotypes. Consistent with previous studies (e.g., [27]), the CAST and PWK haplotypes had higher magnitude effects compared with the classical inbred strains. This pattern was observed for both local- and distal-eQTL (S8A Fig) and local-cQTL; the numbers of detected distal-cQTL were too low to produce clear trends (S8B Fig).\n\nCytochrome c oxidase subunit 7C (Cox7c) is an example of a gene that possessed local-eQTL with highly correlated effects in all three tissues (Fig 3A). The local-eQTL consistently drove higher expression when the CAST haplotype was present, intermediate expression with 129, NOD, and NZO haplotypes, and lower expression with AJ, B6, PWK, and WSB haplotypes. Though the haplotype effects on relative expression levels within each tissue were consistent, we noted that the expression level was significantly higher in liver compared with both lung (q = 5.41 \u00d7 10\u221218) and kidney (q = 6.25 \u00d7 10\u221219). Ubiquitin C (Ubc) is another example of a gene with consistent local-eQTL detected in all three tissues (S12 Fig).\n\nWe found instances where haplotype effects across the three tissues were inconsistent, referring to these as tissue-specific effects (within this subset of tissues). The strongest support of tissue-specificity would be given by QTL pairs whose effects are uncorrelated. For example, the solute carrier family 44, member 3 (Slc44a3) gene has local-eQTL effects that are correlated in lung and kidney but anticorrelated in liver (Fig 3B), suggesting the liver eQTL could be transgressive [28] relative to the eQTL in lung and kidney, whereby the effects of the haplotypes are reversed. For Slc44a3, CAST, PWK, and WSB haplotypes result in higher expression in liver but lower expression in lung and kidney. The local-eQTL for Slc44a3 were more similar in location in lung and kidney whereas the liver eQTL was more distal to the gene TSS. Overall, the expression data, estimated effects, and patterns of association are consistent with lung and kidney sharing a causal local-eQTL that is distinct from the one in liver.\n\nThe CC founder strains all possess contributions from three mouse subspecies of M. musculus: domesticus (dom), castaneus, (cast), and musculus (mus) [29]. Allele-specific gene expression in mice descended from the CC founders often follow patterns that matched the subspecies inheritance at the gene regions [30, 31]. We found that phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 2 gamma (Pik3c2g), a gene of interest for diabetes-related traits [32], had tissue-specific local-eQTL in all three tissues that closely matched the subspecies inheritance at their specific genomic coordinates. The local-eQTL in all three tissues were all pair-wise uncorrelated (Fig 4). Further, expression of Pik3c2g varied at statistically significant levels for liver versus lung (q = 3.12 \u00d7 10\u221213) and lung versus kidney (q = 3.55 \u00d7 10\u22126). In lung, the CAST haplotype (cast subspecies lineage) resulted in higher expression, consistent with a cast versus dom/mus allelic series. In kidney, the B6, 129, NZO, and WSB haplotypes (dom subspecies) resulted in higher expression, whereas AJ and NOD (mus), CAST (cast), and PWK (dom) haplotypes showed almost no expression, mostly consistent with a dom versus cast/mus allelic series. The PWK founder appears inconsistent, but we note that the QTL peak was in a small dom haplotype block interspersed within a broader mus region. The expression level in kidney of Pik3c2g in PWK was low, similar to AJ and NOD, suggesting that the causal variant may be located in the nearby region, where all three have mus inheritance and, notably, where the peak variant association occurred. In liver, the B6 haplotype resulted in lower expression compared with the other haplotypes. Interestingly, the liver eQTL was in a region that contained a recombination event between dom and mus, only present in B6, which may explain the unique expression pattern.\n\nHaplotype effects that correlate across tissues can provide additional evidence for distal-QTL, even those with marginal significance in any single tissue. For example, the aldo-keto reductase family 1, member E1 (Akr1e1; Fig 5A) gene is located on chromosome 13 with no local-eQTL detected in any tissue. Distal-eQTL in all tissues were detected for Akr1e1 that localized to the same region on chromosome 4. The haplotype effects of the distal-eQTL were all highly correlated, with AJ, B6, 129, and CAST haplotypes corresponding to higher Akr1e1 expression. Across tissues, expression was significantly higher in liver and kidney compared with lung (q = 1.63 \u00d7 10\u221219 and q = 4.40 \u00d7 10\u221234, respectively). Another example is the Period circadian clock 2 (Per2; Fig 5B) gene, which possessed intra-chromosomal distal-eQTL approximately 100Mb away from the TSS that were detected in all three tissues at a lenient chromosome-wide significance (Analysis C; FDR \u2264 0.2). The haplotype effects were significantly correlated among the tissues, characterized by high expression with the NOD and PWK haplotypes present. Together, these findings provide strong validation for the distal-eQTL, which would commonly not be detected based on tissue-stratified analyses. Other unique patterns of distal genetic regulation were detected, such as for ring finger protein 13 gene (Rnf13) with distal-eQTL that varied across tissues, described in S13 Fig.\n\nAcross the three tissues, between 13-42 local-eQTL showed evidence of mediation through proximal accessible chromatin regions at genome-wide significance, and 35-106 at chromosome-wide significance (S6 Table). The coiled-coil domain containing 137 gene (Ccdc137) is a strong example of this type of mediation. Fig 7 shows the genome scans that identify both the local-eQTL for Ccdc137 and the cQTL near it. The significance of the eQTL was sharply reduced when we conditioned on chromatin accessibility, and the significance of the cQTL was stronger than the eQTL, as expected by the proposed mediator model.\n\nEstablishing mediation requires more than mere co-localization of eQTL and cQTL. For example, local-eQTL and co-localizing cQTL were identified for both haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase domain containing 3 (Hdhd3) in liver (S14A Fig) and acyl-Coenzyme A binding domain containing 4 (Acbd4) in kidney (S14B Fig). Comparing the statistical associations at the loci for eQTL and cQTL, and the corresponding haplotype effects, however, showed better correspondence in the case of Hdhd3 than for Acbd4: a strong mediation signal was detected for Hdhd3, indicated by the decreased eQTL association when conditioning on the chromatin state, whereas mediation was not detected for Abcd4, consistent with expression and chromatin accessibility having causally different origins.\n\nEight genes were identified with mediated distal-eQTL (S7 Table). For example, the distal-eQTL of cyclin Y-like 1 (Ccnyl1) was mediated by the expression of zinc finger protein 979 (Zfp979), a putative transcription factor (S15 Fig). The haplotype effects at the distal-eQTL of Ccnyl1 were highly correlated with those at the local-eQTL of Zfp979, though with a reduction in overall strength, in accordance with the proposed mediation model.\n\nAs detailed above, Akr1e1 possessed a strong distal-eQTL in all three tissues located on chromosome 4 in the region of 142.5\u2014148.6Mb with significantly correlated haplotype effects. Mediation analysis suggested this effect is mediated in lung through activity of Zinc finger protein 985 (ZFP985), whose gene is also located on chromosome 4 at 147.6Mb (S16 Fig).\n\nZFP985 possesses an N-terminal Kr\u00fcppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, representing a well-characterized class of transcriptional regulators in vertebrates [36] that recruit histone deacetylases and methyltransferases, inducing a chromatin state associated with regulatory silencing. Akr1e1 and Zfp985 expression were negatively correlated (r = \u22120.69), consistent with ZFP985 inhibiting Akr1e1 expression. This same distal-eQTL and mediator relationship for Akr1e1 was observed in kidney tissue from 193 DO mice (S17 Fig). It was previously postulated that Akr1e1 is distally regulated by the reduced expression 2 (Rex2) gene, also a ZFP that contains a KRAB domain and resides in the same region of chromosome 4 [37]. Our distal-eQTL overlap their Idd9.2 regulatory region, defined as spanning 145.5\u2014148.57Mb, mapped with NOD mice congenic with C57BL/10 (B10) [35]. The B10 haplotype was found to be protective against development of diabetes, characteristic of NOD mice. AKR1e1 is involved in glycogen metabolism and the Idd9 region harbors immune-related genes, suggesting genes regulated by elements in the Idd9 region may be diabetes-related. Consistent with these studies, CC strains with NOD inheritance at the distal-eQTL had low expression of Akr1e1, observed in all tissues. Genetic variation from B10 is not present in the CC, but the closely related B6 founder had high expression of Akr1e1 like B10. NZO, PWK, and WSB haplotypes resulted in low Akr1e1 expression, similar to NOD, while AJ, 129, and CAST haplotypes joined B6 as driving high expression (Fig 9). Variable expression of Zfp985 is a strong candidate for driving these effects on Akr1e1.\n\nAdditional sources of genetic regulation of Akr1e1 were observed for kidney, where a strong distal-cQTL for an accessible chromatin site corresponding to the promoter of Akr1e1 was detected in the Idd9.2 region on chromosome 4. Mediation analysis strongly supported chromatin accessibility in this region mediating the distal-eQTL (mediation p = 2.18 \u00d7 10\u221213; see Methods). The haplotype effects for the distal-cQTL were highly correlated with the distal-eQTL effects (r = 0.92). The relative magnitudes of the QTL effect sizes and mediation p-values (S18 Fig) support a causal model whereby increased Zfp985 expression reduces expression of Akr1e1 by altering chromatin accessibility near the Akr1e1 promoter (Fig 9).\n\nWe found that the effect sizes of cQTL are on average lower than eQTL (see S19 Fig), as has been previously reported [22]. The reduced number of cQTL compared with eQTL is likely due to both technical and biological reasons. Technically, the RNA-seq assay measures a distinct class of molecules (mRNAs) that can be accurately extracted from cells with the resulting sequence reads mapped to the transcriptome, which encompasses < 5% of the genome. In contrast, the transposon incorporation event central to ATAC-seq is enriched in, but not solely limited to, accessible chromatin. Unlike the transcriptome, accessible chromatin can occur anywhere in the genome and regions are defined empirically by the data. Thus, the signal from the assay is more variable and noisy across samples, which impedes our ability to detect cQTL. Biologically, if a variant affects the activity of a regulatory element that alters expression levels, it is expected that the mRNA levels in the sample will reflect this. By contrast, even if a variant affects chromatin accessibility, it may do so in a manner that is difficult to detect above the background noise of the assay. In recent studies of gene expression and chromatin accessibility in the adult brain from the same individuals, 2,154,331 cis-eQTL were found for 467 individuals [38], whereas only 6,200 cQTL were detected, albeit for only 272 individuals [39]. While the reduced number of individuals undoubtedly contributed to this lower number of detected cQTL, it is likely that significantly fewer cQTL would be found in the same number of individuals.\n\nDetecting QTL and mediation depends not only on sample size but also on biological and technical factors that are difficult to quantify across the tissues. Although it is possible that liver has fewer actual cQTL (and thus fewer chromatin mediators) than lung and kidney, it is also possible that the signal quality of the ATAC-seq is lower for this tissue, resulting in fewer detections due to increased technical noise. True biological differences in the number of cQTL and mediator usage among the tissues would likely reflect multi-level regulatory programs specific to each tissue, a complex subject requiring more targeted experiments than used here.\n\nMulti-tissue QTL analyses are increasingly used in both humans, such as within the GTEx project (e.g., [40, 41]), and in mice (e.g., [42, 43]). We believe our use of formal statistical tests of the correlation coefficient between the haplotype effects of overlapping QTL is novel in defining co-localizing QTL across tissues. This method allows us to identify loci likely representing tissue-specific QTL with unique haplotype effects patterns, as demonstrated for the gene Pik3c2g (Fig 4). This approach can also detect consistent haplotype effects, as with the gene Per2 (Fig 5B), which possessed only marginally significant distal-eQTL in the three tissues, suggesting jointly mapping QTL across all tissues increases power. Formal joint analysis approaches have been proposed, largely implemented for detecting SNP associations, including meta-analysis on summary statistics (e.g., [43, 44]) and fully joint analysis, including Bayesian hierarchical models [45] and mixed models [46]. Extending such methods to haplotype-based analysis in MPPs poses some challenges, including how to best generalize methods to more complex genetic models and for the CC with a limited number of unique genomes. Nonetheless, when multiple levels of molecular traits are measured, joint analyses could conceivably be incorporated into the mediation framework to improve detection power.\n\nHaplotype-based association in MPP allows for the detection of multi-allelic QTL [31], such as potentially observed within the kidney at the local-eQTL of Pik3c2g, where mice with B6 contributions in the region have an intermediate level of expression. The correlation coefficient between the haplotype effects for QTL pairs provides an interesting summary, generally not possible in the simpler bi-allelic setting commonly used in variant association analysis. The extent of the correlation between the haplotype effects for QTL pairs of certain genes, such as Cox7c (Fig 3A) suggests that these QTL are at least subtly multi-allelic. Correlated haplotype effects are consistent with the genetic regulation, even local to the gene TSS, being potentially complex, likely due to founder-specific modifiers.\n\nWe detected numerous eQTL pairs with correlated haplotype effects across tissues but with significantly different magnitudes of overall expression\u2014for example, Cox7c, Ubc, Slc44a3, and Akr1e1. We propose two potential explanations for this unique co-occurrence. First, whole tissues differ in their cellular composition. It may be that these genes are primarily expressed in a common cell type whose proportion varies between the different tissue types, and that the observed differential expression reflects this compositional variation. This hypothesis could be tested by follow-up single cell experiments. Second, each tissue may have additional unique regulatory elements that further modulate expression levels. Uncovering such elements would require in-depth analysis of tissue-specific regulation.\n\nThe statistical methods underlying mediation analyses were largely developed in the context of social sciences [3\u20135], and more recently extended to a genomics setting in which there is generally less experimental control of the relationship between the mediator and outcome. Our mediation analysis approach is adapted from previous studies in DO mice [22, 23, 33] but adds the use of QTL effect sizes to establish consistency with the directionality of the relationships and the formal calculation of an empirical mediation p-value through permutation. Related conditional regression approaches were used in the incipient pre-CC lines [47, 48]. Mediation results largely reflect the correlations between the variables after adjusting for additional sources of variation, such as covariates and batch effects. We further require the mediator QTL to have a larger effect size than the outcome QTL in order to identify trios that are consistent with the proposed causal models. It must be emphasized, however, that these steps are not equivalent to experimentally controlling the directionality of the relationship between a gene\u2019s expression level and a putative mediator, nor is such control feasible in a large-scale experiment. Variable measurement error on the mediator and gene could flip the perceived directionality of the relationship, resulting in both false positive and negative mediations. Alternatively, the relationships could be more complex than the simple models used here, e.g. feedback between the mediator and gene, which these procedures will not detect. Additionally, the causal mediator may not be observed in the data, allowing for other candidates, correlated with the missing causal element, to be incorrectly identified as mediators.\n\nDespite these limitations, the mediation analysis used here provides specific causal candidates for local-eQTL (mediated through chromatin) and distal-eQTL (mediated through nearby genes). For example, we show strong evidence for ZFP985 mediating the genetic regulation of Akr1e1 (Fig 9). Additional evidence suggests this is done by ZFP985 contributing to reduced Akr1e1 promoter activity. It is possible that Zfp985 expression is simply strongly correlated with the true mediator, and others have alternatively proposed Rex2 expression as a candidate [35], which we did not consider due to low expression in all three tissues. Regardless of the identity of the true mediator, our analysis shows strong evidence that it acts causally by reducing chromatin accessibility near Akr1e1.\n\nOur reduced sample size of 47 CC strains motivated our use of multiple scopes of statistical significance, from testing for QTL locally to genome-wide. As expected, the additional local-QTL detected by less stringent methods have smaller effect sizes (orange and purple dots for C and L, respectively; S19 Fig). Based on a recent evaluation of QTL mapping power in the CC using simulation [26], this study had approximately 80% power to detect genome-wide QTL with a 55% effect size or greater. Effect size estimates for genome-wide QTL (green dots; S19 Fig) are consistent with this expectation, albeit potentially inflated due to the Beavis effect [49], and provide interpretable point summaries for haplotype-based QTL mapping, analogous to minor allele effect estimates in SNP-based studies. We calculated estimates of effect size in two ways, one based on a fixed effect fitting of the QTL term and the other as a random term [50]. Notably, a small number of the distal-eQTL had low random effect size estimates (S20 Fig) compared with their fixed effects-based estimates, likely the result of outliers with lowly-observed founder inheritance (e.g. rare allele) at the putative QTL. Alternatively, a residual variation estimate, i.e. RSS, could be calculated from the shrunken haplotype effects to identify likely false positives, but not be as aggressively reduced as the variance component-based estimates, representing a middle ground approach that was found to be effective [51]. We primarily reported fixed effects estimates due to their consistency with reported expectations [26] for a study of this size.\n\nThese QTL mapping results are largely consistent with the molecular traits with detected QTL possessing primarily Mendelian genetic regulation (large effect sizes: > 60%). The relatively limited number of CC strains (< 70 strains) constrains our ability to effectively map QTL for highly complex and polygenic traits. Nevertheless, this study supports the value of CC strains for mapping QTL for simpler traits, such as large effect molecular phenotypes, particularly when considering the further gains that use of replicate observations per strain would yield (not used here). Additionally, joint and/or comparative analyses with the DO and the founder strains can provide strong confirmation of subtle findings in the CC.\n\nPrior to sacrifice, mice were anesthetized with 100 mg/kg nembutal though intraperitoneal injection. These studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) at Texas A&M University and the University of North Carolina.\n\nAdult male mice (8-12 weeks old) from 47 CC strains were acquired from the University of North Carolina Systems Genetics Core (listed in S1 Appendix) and maintained on an NTP 2000 wafer diet (Zeigler Brothers, Inc., Gardners, PA) and water ad libitum. The housing room was maintained on a 12-h light-dark cycle. Our experimental design sought to maximize the number of strains relative to within-strain replications based on the power analysis for QTL mapping in mouse populations [52]; therefore, one mouse was used per strain. Prior to sacrifice, mice were anesthetized with 100 mg/kg nembutal though intraperitoneal injection. Lungs, liver and kidney tissues were collected, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80\u00b0C. These studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) at Texas A&M University and the University of North Carolina. The experimental design and subsequent analyses performed for this study are diagrammed in Fig 1.\n\nTotal RNA was isolated from flash-frozen tissue samples using a Qiagen miRNeasy Kit (Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. RNA purity and integrity were evaluated using a Thermo Scientific Nanodrop 2000 (Waltham, MA) and an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Santa Clara, CA), respectively. A minimum RNA integrity value of 7.0 was required for RNA samples to be used for library preparation and sequencing. Libraries for samples with a sufficient RNA integrity value were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Total RNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, USA) with ribosomal depletion. Single-end (50 bp) sequencing was performed (Illumina HiSeq 2500).\n\nSequencing reads were filtered (sequence quality score \u2265 20 for \u2265 90% of bases) and adapter contamination was removed (TagDust). Reads were mapped to strain-specific pseudo-genomes (Build37, http://csbio.unc.edu/CCstatus/index.py?run=Pseudo) and psuedo-transcriptomes (C57BL/6J RefSeq annotations mapped to pseudo-genomes) using RSEM with STAR (v2.5.3a). Uniquely aligned reads were used to quantify expression as transcripts per million (TPM) values.\n\nFlash frozen tissue samples were pulverized in liquid nitrogen using the BioPulverizer (Biospec) to break open cells and allow even exposure of intact chromatin to Tn5 transposase [53]. Pulverized material was thawed in glycerol containing nuclear isolation buffer to stabilize nuclear structure and then filtered through Miracloth (Calbiochem) to remove large tissue debris. Nuclei were washed and directly used for treatment with Tn5 transposase. Paired-end (50 bp) sequencing was performed (Illumina HiSeq 2500).\n\nReads were similarly filtered as with RNA-seq. Reads were aligned to the appropriate pseudo-genome using GSNAP (parameter set: -k 15, -m 1, -i 5, \u2013sampling = 1, \u2013trim-mismatch-score = 0, \u2013genome-unk-mismatch = 1, \u2013query-unk-mismatch = 1). Uniquely mapped reads were converted to mm9 (NCBI37) mouse reference genome coordinates using the associated MOD files (UNC) to allow comparison across strains. Reads overlapping regions in the mm9 blacklist (UCSC Genome Browser) were removed. Exact sites of Tn5 transposase insertion were determined as the start position +5 bp for positive strand reads, and the end position -5 bp for negative strand reads [54]. Peaks were called using F-seq with default parameters. A union set of the top 50,000 peaks (ranked by F-seq score) from each sample was derived. Peaks were divided into overlapping 300 bp windows [55]. Per sample read coverage of each window was calculated using coverageBed from BedTools [56].\n\nTrimmed mean of M-values (TMM) normalization (edgeR; [57]) was applied to TPM values from read counts of genes and chromatin windows, respectively. Genes with TMM-normalized TPM values \u2264 1 and chromatin windows with normalized counts \u2264 5 for \u2265 50% of samples were excluded (as in [22]) in order to avoid the detection of QTL that result from highly influential non-zero observations when most of the sample have low to no expression. For each gene and chromatin window, we applied K-means clustering with K = 2 to identify outcomes containing outlier observations that could cause spurious, outlier-driven QTL calls. Any gene or chromatin window where the smaller K-means cluster had a cardinality of 1 was removed.\n\nCC genomes are mosaics of the founder strain haplotypes. The founder haplotype contributions for each CC strain was previously reconstructed by the UNC Systems Genetics Core (http://csbio.unc.edu/CCstatus/index.py?run=FounderProbs) with a Hidden Markov Model [58] on genotype calls [MegaMUGA array [59]] from multiple animals per strain, representing ancestors to the analyzed mice. Notably, QTL mapping power is reduced at loci with segregating variants in these ancestors, and where these specific animals likely differ [60]. To reduce the number of statistical tests, adjacent genomic regions were merged through averaging if the founder mosaics for all mice were similar, defined as L2 distance \u2264 10% of the maximum L2 distance (2 for a probability vector). This reduced the number of tested loci from 77,592 to 14,191.\n\nRead counts for each sample were converted to counts per million (CPM), followed by TMM normalization (edgeR). For chromatin accessibility, windows in which > 70% of samples had a CPM \u2264 1 were removed, requiring that samples from at least two of the three tissues to have non-zero measurements in order to be considered for differential analysis between tissues. Genes and chromatin windows with no or low counts across sample libraries provide little evidence for detection of differential signal, thus removing them reduces the multiple testing burden. Differentially expressed genes and accessible chromatin windows were determined using limma [61], which fit a linear model of the TMM-normalized CPM value as the response and fixed effect covariates of strain, batch, and tissue (lung, liver, or kidney). To account for mean-variance relationships in gene expression and chromatin accessibility data, precision weights were calculated using the limma function voom and incorporated into the linear modeling procedure. The p-values were adjusted using a false discovery rate (FDR) procedure [62], and differentially expressed genes and accessible chromatin windows were called based on the q-value \u2264 0.01 and log2 fold-change \u2265 1. Adjacent significantly differential chromatin windows in the same direction were merged with a p-value computed using Simes\u2019 method [63], and chromatin regions were re-evaluated for significance using the Simes p-values.\n\nBiological pathways enriched with differentially expressed genes or accessible chromatin were identified with GSAASeqSP [64] with Reactome Pathway Database annotations (July 24, 2015 release). A list of assayed genes were input to GSAASeqSP along with a weight for each gene g, calculated as:\nweightg=sign(\u0394g)\u00d7(1-qg),(1)\nwhere sign(\u0394g) is the sign of the fold change in gene g expression, and qg is the FDR-adjusted differential expression p-value. Pathways with gene sets of cardinality < 15 or > 500 were excluded.\n\nFor pathway analysis of differentially accessible chromatin near genes, each chromatin region was mapped to a gene using GREAT v3.0.0 (basal plus extension mode, 5 kb upstream, 1 kb downstream, and no distal extension). Weights were calculated as with gene expression, but with sign(\u0394g) representing the sign of the fold-change in accessibility of the chromatin region with minimum FDR-adjusted p-value that is associated with gene g.\n\nQTL analysis was performed for both gene expression and chromatin accessibility using regression on the inferred founder haplotypes [65], a variant of Haley-Knott regression [66, 67] commonly used for mapping in the CC [26, 27, 68\u201371] and other MPPs, such as Drosophila [72].\n\nFor a given trait\u2014the expression of a gene or the accessibility of a chromatin region\u2014a genome scan was performed in which at each of the 14,191 loci spanning the genome, we fit the linear model,\nyi=\u03bc+batchb[i]+QTLi+\u03b5i(2)\nwhere yi is the trait level for individual i, \u03bc is the intercept, batchb is a categorical fixed effect covariate with five levels b = 1, \u2026, 5 representing five sequencing batches for both gene expression and chromatin accessibility and where b[i] denotes the batch relevant to i, \u03b5i \u223c N(0, \u03c32) is the residual noise, and QTLi models the genetic effect at the locus, namely that of the eQTL for expression or the cQTL for chromatin accessibility. Specifically, the QTL term models the (additive) effects of alternate haplotype states and is defined as QTLi = \u03b2Txi, where xi = (xi,AJ, \u2026, xi,WSB)T is a vector of haplotype dosages (i.e., the posterior expected count, from 0 to 2, inferred by the haplotype reconstruction) for the eight founder haplotypes, and \u03b2 = (\u03b2AJ, \u2026, \u03b2WSB)T is a corresponding vector of fixed effects. Note that in fitting this term as a fixed effects vector, the linear dependency among the dosages in xi results in at least one haplotype effect being omitted to achieve identifiability; estimation of effects for all eight founders is performed using a modification described below. Prior to model fitting, to avoid sensitivity to non-normality and strong outliers, the response {yi}i=1n was subject to a rank inverse normal transformation (RINT). The fit of Eq 2 was compared with the fit of the same model omitting the QTL term (the null model) by an F-test, leading to a nominal p-value, reported as the logP = \u2212log10(p-value).\n\nThe FWER was controlled based on permutations specific to each trait. The sample index was permuted 1,000 times and recorded, and then genome scans performed for each trait, using the same permutation orderings. Given a trait, the maximum logP from either the entire genome or the chromosome for each permutation was collected and used to fit a null generalized extreme value distribution (GEV) in order to control the genome- and chromosome-wide error rates, respectively [73]. Error rates were controlled by calculating a p-value for each QTL based on the respective cumulative density functions from the GEVs: permP = 1 \u2212 FGEV(logP), where FGEV is the cumulative density function of the GEV. We denote genome- and chromosome-wide error rate controlling p-values as permPG and permPC respectively.\n\nThe appropriateness of permutation-derived thresholds [74] relies on the CC strains being equally related, thus possessing little population structure and being exchangeable. This assumption was supported by simulations of the funnel breeding design [68]. More recent simulations based on the observed CC strain genomes [26] found non-exchangeable population structure for highly polygenic genetic architectures, albeit at low levels. Nevertheless, we use permutations given that molecular traits often have strong effect QTL that are detectable in the presence of subtle population structure.\n\nOur detection criteria for local-QTL leverages our strong prior belief in local genetic regulation. For a given trait, this local analysis involved examining QTL associations at all loci within a 10Mb window of the gene TSS or chromatin region midpoint. A QTL was detected if the permPC < 0.05. Notably, we can also check whether the corresponding permPG < 0.05, as an additional characterization of statistical significance of detected local-QTL.\n\nChromosome-wide analysis involved examining QTL associations at all loci on the chromosome harboring the gene or chromatin region in question. The peak logP is input into a chromosome-wide GEV, producing a permPC, which are further subjected to adjustment by FDR to account for multiple testing across the traits [75]. Compared with Analysis L, this procedure is more stringent with respect to local-QTL because of the additional FDR adjustment. In addition, it can detect distal-QTL outside the local region of the trait. Note, since only the most significant QTL is recorded, this procedure will disregard local-QTL if a stronger distal-QTL on the chromosome is observed.\n\nThe genome-wide analysis is largely equivalent to Analysis C but examines all genomic loci, while an FDR adjustment is made to the genome-wide permPG. Unlike Analysis C, it incorporates additional scans conditioned on detected QTL to potentially identify multiple QTL per trait (i.e. both local- and distal-QTL). Briefly, after a QTL is detected, a subsequent scan (and permutations) is performed in which the previously detected QTL is included in both the null and alternative models, allowing for additional independent QTL to be detected with FDR control. See S2 Appendix for greater detail on this conditional scan procedure and a clear example in S21 Fig. Notably, the local/distal status of the QTL does not factor into Analysis G.\n\nAnalyses L, C, and G should detect many of the same QTL, specifically strong local-QTL. Collectively, they allow for efficient detection of QTL with varying degrees of statistical support while strongly leveraging local status.\n\nThe effect size of a detected QTL was defined as the R2 attributable to the QTL term; specifically, as 1 \u2212 RSSQTL/RSS0, where RSS=\u2211i=1n(yi-yi^)2 is the residual sum of squares, i.e. the sum of squares around predicted value yi^, and RSSQTL and RSS0 denote the RSS calculated for the QTL and null models respectively. We also calculated a more conservative QTL effect size estimate with a QTL random effects model to compare with the R2 estimate.\n\nThe fixed effects QTL model used for mapping, though powerful for detecting associations, is sub-optimal for providing stable estimates of the haplotype effects vector, \u03b2 (calculated as (XTX)\u22121\nXTy, where X is the full design matrix). This is because, among other things, 1) the matrix of haplotype dosages that forms the design matrix of {QTLi}i=1n in Eq 2, is multi-collinear, which leads to instability, and 2) because the number of observations for some haplotypes will often be few, leading to high estimator variance [24]. More stable estimates were therefore obtained using shrinkage. At detected QTL, the model was refit with \u03b2 modeled as a random effect, \u03b2 \u223c N(0, I\u03c42) [50], to give an 8-element vector of the best linear unbiased estimates (BLUPs; [76]), \u03b2\u02dc=(\u03b2\u02dcAJ,\u2026,\u03b2\u02dcWSB)T. These BLUPs, after being centered and scaled, were then used for further comparison of QTL across tissues.\n\nTo summarize patterns of the genetic regulation of gene expression and chromatin accessibility across tissues, we calculated correlations between the haplotype effects of QTL that map to approximately the same genomic region for the same traits but in different tissues. For cross-tissue pairs of local-QTL, we required that both be detected within the 20Mb window around the gene TSS or the chromatin window midpoint. For cross-tissue pairs of distal-QTL, the QTL positions had to be within 10Mb of each other. All detected QTL were considered, including QTL from Analyses G and C controlled at FDR \u2264 0.2, allowing for consistent signal across tissues to provide further evidence of putative QTL with only marginal significance in a single tissue.\n\nFor a pair of matched QTL j and k from different tissues, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient of the BLUP estimates of their haplotype effects, rjk=cor(\u03b2\u02dcj,\u03b2\u02dck). Since each \u03b2\u02dc is an 8-element vector, the corresponding r are distributed such that r6(1-r2)-1\u223ct6 according to the null model of independent variables. Testing alternative models of rjk > 0 and rjk < 0 produced two p-values per pair of QTL. These were then subject to FDR control [62] to give two q-values, qij{r>0} and qij{r<0}. These were then used to classify cross-tissue pairs of QTL as being significantly correlated or anti-correlated, respectively.\n\nVariant association has been used previously in MPP (e.g., [51, 77]), and uses the same underlying model as the haplotype-based mapping (Eq 2), with the QTL term now representing imputed dosages of the minor allele. Variant association can more powerfully detect QTL than haplotype mapping if the simpler variant model is closer to the underlying biological mechanism [78], though it will struggle to detect multi-allelic QTL.\n\nVariant genotypes from mm10 (NCBI38) were obtained using the ISVdb [79] for the CC strains, which were converted to mm9 coordinates with the liftOver tool [80]. Variants were filtered out if their minor allele frequencies \u2264 0.1 or they were not genotyped in one of the CC founder strains to avoid false signals. Tests of association at individual SNPs (variant association) were performed within the local windows of genes with local-QTL detected in more than one tissue. Genes with multiple tissue-selective local-eQTL potentially reflect different functional variants, and could potentially have less consistent patterns of variant association compared with variants that are functionally active in multiple tissues.\n\nMediation analysis has recently been used with genomic data, including in humans (e.g., [10, 15]) and rodents (e.g., [51, 81]), to identify and refine potential intermediates of causal paths underlying phenotypes. We use a similar genome-wide mediation analysis as used with the DO [22, 33] to detect mediators of eQTL effects on gene expression.\n\nIn our study, mediation describes when an eQTL (X) appears to act on its target (Y) in whole or in part through a third variable (M), the mediator, which in this case is a molecular trait. The molecular traits considered here are: a) chromatin accessibility, in which case X serves also as a cQTL (Fig 6A); and, in a separate analysis, b) the expression of a second, distal, gene, in which case X serves also as a distal-eQTL (Fig 6B).\n\nTraditional mediation analysis [3] tests whether the data, for predefined X, Y and M, are consistent with mediation, doing so in four steps. Steps (1) and (2) establish positive associations X \u2192 Y and X \u2192 M; this corresponds to our requirement that both the transcript Y and the candidate mediator M have a co-localizing QTL X. Step (3) establishes mediation by testing for the conditional association M \u2192 Y|X; this corresponds to testing whether the mediator explains variation in gene expression even after controling for the QTL. Step (4) distinguishes \u201cfull mediation\u201d, where mediation explains the association between X and Y entirely, i.e., the QTL acts entirely through the mediator, from \u201cpartial mediation\u201d, where the QTL acts partly through the mediator and partly directly (or through other unmodeled routes).\n\nIn our study, we use an empirical approximation of the above adapted to genome-wide data, building on mediation analysis used in studies of DO mice [22, 23, 33]. In outline: For a given eQTL, i.e., a QTL for which step (1) (X \u2192 Y) has been established, we performed a genome-wide mediation scan. This mediation scan consisted of testing step (4) (X \u2192 Y|M), that is, testing whether the eQTL association was significantly reduced when adding the mediator as a covariate, for a large number of \u201cpotential\u201d mediators, namely all chromatin regions (or transcripts) genome-wide. Note that most of these potential mediators would be formally ineligible under a traditional analysis (i.e., X \u2192 M would not hold) but here helped to define a background (null) level of association. The results of the mediation scan were then filtered to include only results satisfying both of the following criteria: first, the mediator must posess a co-localizing QTL, i.e., a QTL for which step (2) (X \u2192 M) does hold; second, the association between QTL and mediator must be stronger than that between QTL and transcript (X \u2192 M > X \u2192 M), this approximating step (3) (M \u2192 Y|X). We did not attempt to distinguish between partial and full mediation since this distinction was too easily obscured by noise.\n\nThe genome-wide mediation scan procedure in more detail was as follows. Consider an eQTL that our previous genome scan has already shown to affect the expression of gene j. Denote the expression level for j in individual i as yiGj and eQTL effect as eQTLiGj (these respectively correspond to Y and X in the mediation description above). Further, consider a proposed mediator k\u2208K, where K is the set of all eligible chromatin accessible sites or expressed genes, and let mik be the value of that mediator for individual i. The mediation scan for a given gene/eQTL pair j proceeds by performing, for each proposed mediator k\u2208K, a model comparison between the alternative model,\nyiGj=\u03bc+eQTLiGj+mik+batchb[i]+\u03b5i,(3)\nand the null model,\nyiGj=\u03bc+mik+batchb[i]+\u03b5i,\nwhere other terms are as described for Eq 2. (Not, shown are additional covariates, such as conditioned loci, which would be included in both the null and alternative models.) The above model comparison can be seen as re-evaluating the significance of a given eQTL association by conditioning on each proposed mediator in turn (i.e., testing X \u2192 Y|M for each M). The resulting mediation scan, in contrast to the earlier-described genome scans, thus fixes the QTL location while testing across the genome for candidate mediators.\n\nIn general, assuming most proposed mediators are null, the mediated logP should fluctate around the original eQTL logP, since the model comparison will resemble the original test of that locus in the genome scan. For mediators that possess some or all of the information present in the eQTL, however, the mediated logP will drop relative to the original logP, reflecting X \u2192 Y|M being less significant than X \u2192 Y. Empirical significance of genome-wide mediation has previously been determined by comparing the nominal mediator scores to the distribution of mediation scores genome-wide, the latter effectively acting as a null distribution [22, 23, 33]. We instead determine a null distribution explicitly by permutation, characterizing the distribution of the minimum logP (as opposed to maximum logP for QTL scans) to estimate significance and set false positive control (FWER). As with the QTL mapping procedures, we performed mediation scans on 1,000 permutations, permuting the mediators rather than the outcome, to characterize GEVs from the minimum logP, that is, permPm = FGEV(logP), at both chromosome- and genome-wide levels.\n\nDetection of mediation is dependent on a number of assumptions about the underlying variables, their relationships, and those relationships\u2019 directionality [4]. Many of these cannot be controlled in a system as complex as chromatin accessibility and transcriptional regulation in whole living organisms. Nevertheless, signals in the data that are consistent with the mediation model represent candidate causal factors that regulate gene expression. Though it is impossible to ensure that the direction of causation is indeed M \u2192 Y, as assumed by the mediation analysis, we require additional checks to formally declare mediation of an eQTL. The presence of the relationship X \u2192 Y is already established in that mediation scans are only performed for detected eQTL. In addition for any candidate mediator with a significant permPm, we require detection of a mediator QTL: X \u2192 M. These requirements, as mentioned earlier, are consistent with traditional mediation analysis. Finally, in an attempt to identify mediator-to-gene relationships consistent with the proposed models, we require that X \u2192 M is more significant than X \u2192 Y. Though this step cannot confirm the directionality of the relationship between M and Y, as variable noise level between M and Y could reduce the estimated effect size of their respective QTL, it will identify candidate mediators that are consistent with the proposed models. Further details on the mediation analysis are described in S3 Appendix, including the permutation approach and the formal criterion by which mediation is declared for both chromatin and gene mediators (Fig 6).\n\nAll statistical analyses were conducted with the R statistical programming language [82].
