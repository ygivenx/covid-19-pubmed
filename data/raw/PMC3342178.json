{"title": "Knowledge, attitudes and practices related to avian influenza among poultry workers in Nepal: a cross sectional study", "body": "In January 2009 Nepal faced the first localized outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (AI) among poultry, followed by a second outbreak in another area in February of the same year [1,2], but no human cases were registered [3].\n\nIf Nepal were hit by pandemic flu as a consequence of re-assortment or adaptive mutation of the virus and ensuing full human-to-human transmissibility, consequences could be severe. Depending on the planning scenario, fatality numbers are estimated between 15,000 and 130,000 and large numbers of people in need of clinical care might be faced with a severe shortage of hospital beds [4]. Beside the expected toll on human life, a pandemic is bound to incur disastrous economic losses in a country where sectors like farming and tourism, which make a significant contribution to the overall economy, are expected to be particularly hard hit [5,6].\n\nPrevention and control planning have to take account of the whole population, but there are subgroups which are particularly critical, such as poultry or pig farmers, who are among those first in line when it comes to risk of contracting AI. Also they are expected to be a \"bridging population\" in terms of cross-species sharing of viruses and of spreading the disease into their local communities [7,8].\n\nIn early 2006 the Government of Nepal established the Avian Influenza Control Project (AICP) and endorsed a Joint Health and Agriculture National Avian Influenza and Influenza Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan (NAIIPPRP) [4,9] which placed particular emphasis on precautionary behaviours of poultry workers as well as the knowledge and attitudes which drive such practices. A mass media campaign informing about risks and motivating for protective behaviours had been started already soon after HPAI hit Asia in 2003 and was intensified after it had reached Nepal in early 2008.\n\nBased on health-behaviour models such as the Health Belief Model [10] or Protection Motivation Theory [11] crisis communication campaigns usually have a strong focus on providing information and knowledge about risks and protective behaviours. Most evidence accumulated within the context of SARS, H5N1 and the H1N1 outbreak in 2009 is consistent with these models' assumptions about the relevance of risk perceptions and beliefs in the efficacy of protective behaviours [12-17]. Evidence on the role of knowledge about pandemic influenza, however, has been less unequivocal. While some studies have found positive effects on protective behaviours [18-20], others have failed to do so [21,22].\n\nThe objectives of the present study were 1) to identify levels of knowledge about preventive behaviours as well as actual preventive behaviours with regard to avian influenza in Nepalese poultry workers, 2) to investigate factors associated with knowing about and practising preventive behaviours against AI, among them socio-demographic characteristics, media use (health information from TV and newspapers), and experience of fear. Additionally, 3) for preventive behaviours the role of knowledge about such behaviours was investigated.\n\nThe study, which took place in April 2009, was based on a cross-sectional cluster survey design. After obtaining ethical approval from Research Ethics Committee of Institute of Medicine at Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu, Nepal, face-to-face interviews with the help of a standardized questionnaire were conducted with 96 poultry workers age 15 and above from the Rupandehi district, Nepal. This district was chosen because it is one of those with the highest number of poultry farms in the country (N = 186) and was therefore considered of critical importance, but no actual cases of H5N1 had appeared in this area at the time of the study. To prepare the sampling frame a list of poultry farms in Rupandehi was obtained from the District Livestock Services Office (DLSO), which runs a registry of all farms which habitually house more than 50 chickens. From this overall district list the three village development committees (VDCs) with the highest density of poultry farms (75% of all farms in the region) were chosen. At the second stage 10 farms were randomly selected from each of the three VDCs. From each of these farms, proportional to their size, between 1 and 5 poultry workers were interviewed based on a snowballing principle. Prior to the interviews verbal informed consent was obtained from participants. Sample size estimation for the proportion estimates was based on the following assumption: For a desired width of a 95% confidence interval of w = .20, an alpha-level of p = .05, an intra-cluster correlation of r = .02 and a number of m = 30 clusters, the required number in each cluster was n = 3.5 which corresponds to an estimated sample size of 107. The actual sample size obtained from the field was slightly below the estimation i.e. N = 96.\n\nThe interview was based on a standardized questionnaire. Interviewers read the questions to the study participants and recorded responses on an answering sheet. Questions about avian influenza were developed on the basis of a published questionnaire from a study on Italian poultry workers [23] as well as the WHO fact sheet on AI [24].\n\nSocio-demographic information was collected for age, gender, school education and occupational status (owner of poultry farm versus paid employee). Awareness about avian influenza was assessed by asking whether cases of avian influenza among poultry had appeared in Nepal (yes/no). Perceptions of professional risk were measured by a question asking about whether particular professional groups such as poultry workers, butchers or health workers were at risk for contracting avian influenza (yes/no). Further, participants were asked from which sources they had obtained information about avian influenza, among them radio, TV, and newspapers. Also, they indicated how afraid they felt that they could contract avian influenza (five-point-answering scale from \"not at all\" to \"very much\"). Knowledge about protective behaviours was assessed by an open-format question without pre-formulated answering options. Respondents were asked to name all protective measures they knew against the danger of being infected due to work with poultry, and the interviewers recorded the answers on the interview sheet. For each behaviour correctly identified one point was assigned. Afterwards study participants were asked to indicate how often they were using the following preventive measures when dealing with poultry: washing hands with soap and water, donning gloves, face masks, boots/boots covers, putting on protective body garments, and washing and disinfecting utensils and surfaces (five-step-answering format from \"always\" to \"never\"). Attitudes towards government actions were assessed by first describing current government policies and then asking whether respondents agreed with, disagreed with or felt uncertain about these approaches. Finally, another open-format item asked about habitual actions taken when sick or dead poultry was found on the farm.\n\nDescriptive analyses were applied by using means, standard deviations and percentages. Multivariable analyses were performed using logistic regression. The variables included were chosen on the basis of the research questions, intending to test socio-demographic differences in knowledge and behaviour, as well as mass media use, levels of fear, and, for the model testing protective behaviours, the role of knowledge about such behaviours. For the model explaining knowledge age, gender, school education (primary level and lower versus higher than primary education) and occupational status (owner of poultry farm versus paid employee), use of visual mass media for health information (receiving versus not receiving health information from TV and newspapers) and degree of fear experience (scale from 1 \"not at all\" to 5 \"very much\") were entered into the equation. Knowledge was dichotomized as low level (knowing 0 to 2 protective behaviours) versus high level (knowing more than 2 behaviours). The same variables were entered into the regression for the second model testing associations with protective behaviours, which additionally included the variable \"knowledge about behaviours\" (continuous, 1-6). The maximal number of correct behaviours named was actually seven. However, as only extremely few respondents fell into this category the variable was recoded so that the last category included those who knew six and more behaviours. The number of protective behaviours used on a habitual basis (always and often) was dichotomized into low level of behaviours (maximally two behaviours practiced) versus high (more than two behaviours practiced). P-values smaller or equal to 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The analysis was performed with SPSS IBM Statistics 19.0 for Windows.\n\nThe majority of respondents was male (80%) and fell in the age bracket between 25 and 44 years (69%; M = 35; SD = 11.61). Nearly two thirds (63%) were owners of poultry farms, the others (37%) were employed workers. The size of the farms varied between approximately 50 and 30,000 poultry. Twenty eight per cent of the respondents had completed higher secondary and 29% lower secondary education, while 10% were illiterate. As the questionnaire was administered via personal interviews complete datasets were obtained for all respondents on the variables used in the analyses. Nearly everybody (97%) was aware that AI cases in poultry had been detected in Nepal. The main sources of information about AI were radio (99%), followed by TV (56%) and newspapers (33%); only one per cent had received health information from health workers. All of the respondents knew that poultry workers were among the \"at-risk-groups\" for being infected with avian influenza, and the majority (62%) expressed some degree of fear about AI. 44% described themselves as very afraid, while 18% said they were \"rather afraid\" (scale 1-5, M = 3.72, SD = 1.40). As for knowledge about protective behaviours in dealing with poultry, slightly over half (53,1%) of the respondents knew about up to two such measures and a further 26% were aware of three, while only small percentages of respondents could name four or more such practices. Clearly the best known among all measures was hand washing. Protective properties of gloves and face masks were less well known, but still were referred to by a majority. Only few, in comparison, named the protective potential of body suits, boots/boot covers or washing and disinfecting utensils and surfaces (see Table 1).\n\nWhen it came to practicing these behaviours, hand washing with soap and water was the most prevalent practice as it was uniformly reported as being used \"always\" or \"often\". Use of other personal protective actions, however, seemed to be less common practice. Habitual washing and disinfecting of surfaces and utensils was reported by about 40%, customary use of gloves and face masks by slightly less than one third, and only very few stated that they did use special boots or protective body garments (see Table 1). About half (51%) of the group regularly practiced up to two such behaviours, about one third (31,2%) reported using three to four, and only 19,8% more than four of these protection measures.\n\nMost government control measures found uniformly high acceptance. Thus, nearly everybody agreed that in case of an outbreak movements should be restricted (97%), all poultry on the respective farms or in the respective areas be culled (100%) and approval of the DLSO be required to restart a business (100%). However, there were also notable exceptions. Only 27% said they thought that the government steps being taken to prevent avian influenza outbreaks were sufficient, and only 42% thought that the compensation plans were adequate. When asked how they habitually acted when they encountered sick or dead poultry, most respondents stated that they used treatment (96%) and burial of carcasses (95%). Only very few said that when finding sick (1%) or dead poultry (4%) they were in the habit of notifying the District Livestock Services Office.\n\nTable 2 depicts the findings from a logistic regression analysis testing associations between socio-demographic factors, source of AI information, fear experience and level of knowledge about protective behaviours. None of the socio-demographic factors showed any relationship with knowledge. As nearly everybody reported having received information via radio, the analysis for media use compared only those who had received AI information from TV and newspapers with those who had not. Poultry workers who got their information from these visual mass media were significantly more likely to be in the group with high knowledge than those who did not. Also there was an inverse relationship between knowledge and fear, indicating that being less afraid was associated with knowing more about preventive behaviours.\n\nWhen it came to protective behaviours against personal infection one major significant difference occurred for occupational status, indicating that paid employees were considerably more likely to practice a larger number of preventive behaviours than owners of poultry farms. Mass media use, while associated with knowledge was not related with precautionary practices, while level of knowledge did make a difference for such behaviours (see Table 3).\n\nA major limitation of the study lies in the small, non-random sample which restricts possibilities to generalize findings from the present data and also, due to lack of power, might have led to underestimation of potential effects. Another clear weakness is the cross-sectional study design which prohibits drawing causal conclusions about the relationships between some of the variables, such as fear and knowledge or knowledge and practices. Finally, self-report on practices are generally vulnerable to recall bias and social desirability tendencies. The face-to-face-interview situation, while enabling full response-rates on all variables as well as participation of poultry workers who lack reading or writing abilities, might have additionally heightened this type of bias in assessing attitudes and behaviours. As for attitudes, however, the very low percentage of respondents reporting compliance with notification procedures indicates that such tendencies were not pervasive.\n\nThe study points to issues that warrant attention in future prevention and preparedness efforts against AI. While it corroborates the relevance of cognitive factors, such as providing knowledge about effective protection measures, it also particularly highlights the important role of material resources which enable poultry workers in a low-resource country such as Nepal to put knowledge into practice. Beyond large-scale mass education campaigns, future efforts should focus more strongly on target-group-specific information and practical trainings with regard to protective behaviours, but might also consider subsidized social marketing of protective equipment.\n\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n\nVK, KG and DN conceived of the study and participated in its design and the data collection.
