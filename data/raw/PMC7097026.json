{"title": "Viral nephropathy", "body": "The pathogenetic links between viral infection and renal disease are often difficult to establish. The criteria for proving causality are complex and include (besides recognition of the clinical syndrome) serological diagnosis, identification of specific viral antigenemia, and detection in glomerular structures of viral antigens and host antibodies. According to Koch's postulates, the etiological link should be confirmed by complete cure following eradication of the virus, but this is not always possible. The concentration of viral antigens is higher in tissue than in the circulation, where antigens are complexed with specific autoantibodies. Virological and molecular analysis of pathologic tissues by in situ hybridization, polymerase chain reaction and ultrastructural analysis led to successful detection and identification of the virus. It should be noted that tubular uptake of viral particles is common and does not necessarily establish an etiological link with renal disease. Improvement of the renal disease concomitant with clearance of the suspected antigen, or recurrence of glomerulonephritis following reinfection, are additional clinical criteria.\n\nIn most reports, diagnosis of HBV-associated glomerulonephritis has been based on persistence of circulating HBV or HBV DNA, absence of other causative agents, and presence of HBV-specific antigen(s) or viral genome in the glomerulus. One major difference between the human and woodchuck studies is that the hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) system has not been characterized in the latter. In clinical practice, regression of pathology following viral eradication is not easy to demonstrate because of ethical concerns relating to repeat renal biopsies in humans subsequent to clinical remission. As such, the diagnosis of HBV-associated renal disease usually relies heavily upon detection of HBV-specific antigen(s) in glomeruli.\n\nLaboratory testing for diagnosis and assessment of response to treatment should include standard liver biochemistries (serum alanine aminotransferase, \u03b3-glutamyltransferase, and bilirubin levels), and HBV serologies (hepatitis B surface antigen, HBeAg, anti-hepatitis B e, and anti-hepatitis B core antigen antibodies). HBeAg is present in 80% of patients, who might also have high titers of anti-hepatitis B core antigen.21 Subjects with biochemical hepatitis should be tested for circulating HBV DNA22 and undergo liver biopsy. An \u03b1-fetoprotein assay could be an important adjunct.23 Serum C3 and C4 levels can be low in 20\u201350% of patients.\n\nHBV-related membranous nephropathy tends to manifest slightly differently in pediatric and adult patients. In children, there is a strong male preponderance, and the most frequent presentation is nephrotic syndrome, microscopic hematuria, and normal or mildly impaired renal function.24 Pediatric chronic HBV carriers often do not have overt liver disease, and transaminase levels are usually normal. In adults, proteinuria or the nephrotic syndrome are the most common manifestations. Adult male predominance is less obvious than in pediatric populations. Adults are more likely than children to have hypertension, renal dysfunction, and clinical evidence of liver disease.\n\nThe prognosis of HBV-associated membranous nephropathy in children is favorable. Stable renal function and high rates of spontaneous remission have been reported in several geographical areas in which disease prevalence is high. By contrast, adults with HBV-associated membranous nephropathy typically develop progressive disease. In Hong Kong, up to 29% of patients had progressive renal failure, and another 10% developed terminal uremia over 5 years.21 The prognosis is even worse for patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria and abnormal liver function tests at presentation. Over 50% of these patients require renal replacement therapy within 3 years.25 Vertical transmission is associated with poorer outcomes than horizontal transmission, as is endemic versus sporadic infection.21,26\n\nAs mentioned above, HBV infection can also cause MCGN (with or without cryoglobulinemia), mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, and IgAN.19,27 Polyarteritis nodosa has been reported in some patients with HBV and might respond to treatment with corticosteroids and interferon-\u03b1.28 Occasional concomitance of the pathologic subtypes can lead to 'double' glomerulopathies. For instance, membranous nephropathy and IgAN have been reported to coexist in an HBV carrier.29\n\nUnlike affected children, who have a high rate of spontaneous remission,30 adults with HBV-associated membranous nephropathy typically develop progressive disease.21 Various management strategies have been tried, but an ideal agent is yet to be found. Treatment for HBV-associated renal disease should ideally achieve the following objectives: (i) amelioration of nephrotic syndrome and its complications; (ii) preservation of renal function; (iii) normalization of liver function and prevention of hepatic complications of HBV; and (iv) permanent eradication of HBV. Because of the involvement of immune complexes in the disease, immunosuppressive therapy\u2014similar to that used in the idiopathic form of the disease\u2014was once fashionable. Corticosteroids were reported to provide symptomatic relief in isolated cases. The contemporary view, however, is that steroid and cytotoxic agents can cause deleterious hepatic flares or even fatal decompensation by enhancing viral replication when the drugs are withdrawn.31\n\nAnother approach is treatment with an antiviral agent. Interferon-\u03b1 is a naturally occurring cytokine produced by B lymphocytes, null lymphocytes, and macrophages that exerts antiviral, antiproliferative and immunomodulatory effects. While reportedly useful in children,32 interferon-\u03b1 has produced mixed results in adults with HBV-associated membranous nephropathy.21,26\n\nIntroduction of the nucleoside analog lamivudine has revolutionized the treatment of chronic HBV infection.33 Lamivudine is the (\u2013)-enantiomer of 3\u2032-thiacytidine. This analog inhibits DNA synthesis by terminating the nascent proviral DNA chain through interference with the reverse transcriptase activity of HBV. In children and adults with HBV-associated membranous nephropathy, lamivudine has been anecdotally reported to induce remission of nephrotic syndrome and to suppress viral replication.24,34 In a recent analysis comparing 10 adult nephrotic patients with HBV-related membranous nephropathy who received lamivudine with 12 matched historical control subjects who presented in the pre-lamivudine era, lamivudine significantly improved proteinuria, aminotransferase levels, and renal outcome over a 3-year period.25 Randomized studies in a larger cohort of patients are needed to prove this effect.\n\nA potential limitation of prolonged treatment with lamivudine is emergence of drug-resistant virus strains resulting from induction and selection of HBV variants with mutations at the tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (YMDD) motif of DNA polymerase. One agent that might be useful in lamivudine-resistant cases is adefovir dipivoxil, an acyclic nucleotide analog that is effective against both lamivudine-resistant HBV mutants and wild-type HBV.35 This agent does have nephrotoxic potential, and there are no clinical data on its efficacy in HBV-related membranous nephropathy that does not respond to lamivudine treatment. Data do indicate, however, that the recommended dose of 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil is associated with a relatively low risk of nephrotoxicity.36\n\nWhile awaiting an ideal agent for treatment of HBV-associated glomerulopathy, active immunization remains the most effective means of immunoprophylaxis.37 In Taiwan, active immunization of all newborns since 1984 has led to a dramatic (10-fold) decline in the incidence of neonatal HBV infection and its sequelae.38 In the US, universal vaccination of infants began in 1991, and a 67% reduction in HBV infection was recorded 10 years later. In 2003, the WHO recommended that all countries establish universal HBV immunization programs for infants and adolescents.39\n\nLaboratory testing coupled with renal biopsy establishes the diagnosis of HCV-related MCGN. Most patients will have anti-HCV antibody, as well as HCV RNA, in serum. Serum transaminase levels are elevated in 70% of patients. Cryoglobulins are detected in 50\u201370% of patients. Serum electrophoresis and immunofixation detects type II (mixed) cryoglobulins. Monoclonal rheumatoid factor, almost invariably an IgM\u03ba, is a distinguishing feature of cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis. The amount of cryoglobulins, usually measured as a cryocrit, varies between patients and with time in a given patient (range 2\u201370%). \u03ba Light chains are also commonly present in the urine. The serum complement pattern, which does not change greatly with clinical disease activity, is also discriminative. Characteristically, early complement components (C4 and C1q) and CH50 are present at very low or undetectable levels in these patients, whereas the C3 level tends to remain normal or is only slightly depressed.\n\nRenal disease associated with HCV is rare in children. The typical age of disease onset is the fifth or sixth decade of life after longstanding infection, often in association with mild subclinical liver disease. Patients might have other symptoms of cryoglobulinemia, such as palpable purpura and arthralgias. Renal manifestations include nephrotic (20%) or non-nephrotic proteinuria and microscopic hematuria.45 Acute nephritic syndrome is the presenting feature in about a quarter of cases. Renal insufficiency, frequently of mild severity, occurs in about half of patients. Over 80% of patients have refractory hypertension at presentation, which might be responsible for a considerable number of cardiovascular deaths.\n\nThe clinical course of HCV-associated renal disease can vary dramatically. This disease does not frequently progress to uremia, despite the persistence of urinary abnormalities in the majority of patients. When such progression does occur, it tends to be in males and those of older age. According to an Italian series, around 15% of patients eventually require dialysis.46 Other forms of glomerular injury, including membranous nephropathy, FSGS, mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, and crescentic glomerulonephritis, have been reported in HCV carriers as individual case reports and small series. Notably, membranous nephropathy in HCV carriers is characterized by the absence of cryoglobulin and male predominance.47\n\nIn general, therapy can be directed at two levels: removal of cryoglobulins by plasmapheresis; and inhibition of cryoglobulin synthesis by attenuating immune responses (using steroids or cytotoxic agents) or suppressing viral replication (using interferon and ribavirin). Before the association between HCV and cryoglobulinemic MCGN was established, steroids and cyclophosphamide were the mainstays of treatment. Our awareness of this link has facilitated a more rational approach to management of this condition. Controlled trials have shown that antiviral therapy with interferon-\u03b1 is associated with improvements in systemic symptoms of immune complex disease. Unfortunately, post-therapy relapse occurs in a large proportion of patients, particularly when interferon monotherapy is administered in short courses. Introduction of combination therapy with interferon-\u03b12b plus ribavirin was an important milestone in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C.48 This cocktail has also produced favorable results in mixed cryoglobulinemia, although non-responses and relapses after initial improvements still occur.49\n\nThe introduction of pegylated forms of interferon (peginterferon) in 2000 was another breakthrough in treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Recent data on peginterferon and ribavirin combination therapy are encouraging.50 An increased rate of treatment failure in carriers of HCV genotype 1 has been recognized.51 Observational studies support the effectiveness of peginterferon and ribavirin combination therapy in HCV-associated cryoglobulinemic MCGN. One therapeutic drawback is the hemolytic effect that complicates ribavirin therapy, particularly in patients with functional renal impairment. This difficulty has been overcome by adjusting the dose according to glomerular filtration rate instead of body weight alone, and utilizing recombinant erythropoietin to combat anemia. Post-treatment renal biopsy showed histological improvement in two of three patients who received combination therapy for 12 months.52\n\nClinical manifestations of HIVAN with FSGS are nephrotic-range proteinuria and renal insufficiency. Hypertension and edema are uncommon. In overt cases, ultrasonography typically reveals enlarged, highly echogenic kidneys, which probably develop in response to microcystic tubular dilatation. Before effective antiretroviral treatment was available, clinical progression was rapid. Intensive antiretroviral treatment delays progression.57\n\nPathology of the HIV-associated disease mediated by immune complexes resembles lupus nephropathy. The clinical presentation is nephrotic syndrome with microscopic hematuria. Progression to renal failure occurs, but more slowly than in HIVAN. Patients often have HCV coinfection, but HIV seems to have the prevailing role. Viral antigen has been detected in glomeruli, and antibodies eluted from the kidney react with HIV antigens in circulating immune complexes (IgA-p24 antigen, IgG-p24 and IgG-gp120). In cases of HIV-related IgAN, circulating immune complexes containing IgA idiotype antibodies have been detected.58\n\nMost patients with HIV-associated thrombotic microangiopathy/hemolytic uremic syndrome present with acute renal failure, microscopic hematuria, and non-nephrotic proteinuria. Multiorgan involvement is frequent and prognosis is poor, with a high rate of mortality. Multifactorial etiologies encompass drugs, neoplasia, lymphoma and infection.\n\nPVB19 has been associated with acute glomerulonephritis. Typical life stage of onset is the second or third decade. Patients present with mild proteinuria and microhematuria, with low levels of serum complement 3. The pathology of this disease is characterized by endocapillary glomerulonephritis, MCGN, or both, with subendothelial deposits. PVB19 capsid protein is found in the glomeruli.10 Spontaneous recovery is the norm.\n\nPVB19 is also associated with collapsing glomerulopathy. Prevalence of PVB19 DNA in renal biopsies (78%) and peripheral blood (87%) is significantly higher in patients with collapsing glomerulopathy than in those with other nephropathies.10 Glomerular and tubular infection with PVB19 might trigger collapsing glomerulopathy, but only in patients with immune defects and a racial predisposition (African descent).8 Most intriguingly, Tanawattanacharoen and coworkers9 detected PVB19 DNA in 80% of patients with 'idiopathic' FSGS, and frequently also in controls. These results possibly reflect the presence of latent DNA from past infection. Failure to localize PVB19 nucleic acid within kidney is evidence against ongoing, high-level viral replication.\n\nHantaviruses are responsible for 'hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome', an acute interstitial nephritis resulting from direct vascular injury of renal tissue.59 The severe form leads to acute renal failure in 50% of cases. Less severe forms occur in nonendemic areas, and present primarily as fever, hepatitis, and mild renal impairment. In most cases, glomeruli are not affected and the pathology is tubulointerstitial. Isolated cases with immune complex glomerular disease have been described, in association with diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis and complete recovery after remission of the systemic clinical syndrome.60\n\nSix percent of patients suffering from severe acute respiratory distress syndrome had acute renal impairment.61 Despite detection of viral DNA in the urine, there was no evidence of viral tropism of the kidney. The pathology is exclusively tubulointerstitial nephritis. The mechanism of disease is probably related to multiorgan failure, rhabdomyolysis, and hemodynamic disturbance.\n\nRenal infection with BK virus affects kidney allograft recipients, leading to renal dysfunction and sometimes graft loss.62 More rarely, acute interstitial nephritis is observed in immunocompromised patients.63\n\nHepatitis A virus infection can present as acute post-infectious glomerulopnephritis with pathology resembling that of IgAN.64 More commonly, hepatitis A virus induces acute renal failure secondary to acute fulminant hepatitis.65 Acute renal failure complicating other viral infections, such as Epstein\u2013Barr virus66 and dengue fever,67 is related to multiorgan failure, rhabdomyolysis, and hepatorenal syndrome.\n\nDiverse mechanisms of glomerular and tubulointerstitial injury and heterogeneous clinicopathologic patterns underlie the relationship between viral infection and glomerular disease. The etiological role of some viruses is still undefined. Molecular biology techniques are vital in elucidating the precise location and role of viruses in the pathogenesis of virus-related nephropathy.\n\nWe searched PubMed using the term \u201cvirus\u201d with the following keywords in different combinations: \u201cglomerulonephritis\u201d, \u201cnephropathy\u201d, \u201crenal failure\u201d, and \u201ckidney\u201d."}
