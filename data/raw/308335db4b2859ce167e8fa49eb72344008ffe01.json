{"title": "The Matrix Protein VP40 from Ebola Virus Octamerizes into Pore-like Structures with Specific RNA Binding Properties", "body": "). by a combination of single isomorphous replacement (SIR) and multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) General Architecture Both NTD protein variants analyzed here form toroidal methods. The final model contains residues 69 to 192 and a short stretch of very well-defined single-stranded octameric rings (assembled by crystallographic symmetry) with a wide central pore (Figure 1 ). The ring struc-RNA, containing the sequence 5\u0408-U-G-A-3\u0408 (phasing and refinement statistics are presented in Table 1 ).\n\ntures are composed of four dimeric antiparallel \u2424 sandwich domains ( Figure 1A) . Each domain contains six The P6 2 22 crystal form [VP40(31-212)], which contains two molecules per asymmetric unit, was subsequently antiparallel \u2424 strands forming two sheets and three \u2423 helices that pack laterally against the \u2424 structure. The solved by Patterson search techniques. The chain traces in both crystal forms are well superimposable, with only ring structure has an outer diameter of \u202b48\u0641\u202c \u00c5 and an inner diameter of \u202b71\u0641\u202c \u00c5 ( Figure 1B) ; the width of the particle is slight rms deviations for the C\u2423 atoms of both molecules (0.37 \u00c5 for molecule A and 0.42 \u00c5 for molecule B). Ac-\u202b24\u0641\u202c \u00c5 ( Figures 1C) . In each monomer, the C-terminal ends (residues 184 to 194) reach over to the neighboring monomer, which contacts them in an extended conformation. This arrangement leads to the positioning of the C-terminal ends at the outer side of the ring, pointing away from it, almost at the same horizontal level and only 15 \u00c5 apart ( Figure 1C ). This suggests that the C-terminal domains, which were not present in the construct, could be positioned at the side, above or below the ring. The structure lacks \u202b07\u0641\u202c residues at the N terminus and its N-terminal end is positioned at the outside of the ring, close to the C-terminal end (Pro 185) ( Figure 1B) . Each monomer binds a short stretch of RNA at the dimerdimer interface, characterized by excellent electron density for a triribonucleotide ( Figure 1D ).\n\nThe interface of the antiparallel dimer occupies 1250 \u00c5 2 . The dimer is stabilized by salt bridges from Glu160A (molecule A) to Arg148B (molecule B) and Arg151B, respectively; further polar interactions are found between Trp95A and Gln184B ( Figure 2A ). The effect of the interactions is 2-fold due to the antiparallel nature of the dimer. The stability of the dimer is further enhanced by hydrophobic core interactions (residues Trp95, Pro97, Phe161, Ile74, and Ile82 from molecules A and B) ( Figure  2B ) as well as residues 189 to 194 (A and B), which interact in an extended conformation on the outside of the ring with a neighboring molecule ( Figure 1A ). All polar residues except Glu160, which is substituted by Asn, and all of the hydrophobic residues involved in the stabilization of the interface are conserved between VP40 sequences from Ebola and Marburg viruses [9]. The interface of the antiparallel dimer coincides with the interface occupied by the N-and C-terminal domains in the closed monomeric conformation, and residues covered by both interfaces are approximately the same [9]. This indicates that the C-terminal domain has to move away to allow the formation of the NTD dimer as suggested [11] .\n\nThe dimer-dimer interactions bury a surface of 990 \u00c5 2 (involving molecules A and C). This is dominated by hydrophobic interactions complemented with polar main chain contacts, including hydrogen bonds between the amide of Gly141A and the carbonyl of Tyr171C, and the oxygen of Thr173A and the amide of Gly139C. In addition, residues from the loop structure connecting \u2424 strand 4 and \u2423 helix 3 are sandwiched between two loop structures from a neighboring molecule, namely one connecting \u2424 strands 1 and 2 and the other one bridging \u2423 helix 4 with \u2424 strand 6. This creates a weak hydrophobic core on both corresponding ends of the \u2424 sandwich structures. The formation of the dimer- tification of this Uri-Gua-Ade nucleotide ( Figure 1D ). Uri1R displays its sugar puckering as C 2 \u0408-endo [29] (Table 2), which is stabilized by a number of polar interactions between symmetry-related Uri1R residues. The base moiety is positioned in syn conformation, fixed by an internal hydrogen bond (Uri1R O 5 \u0408-O 2 , 3.3 \u00c5 ). This positions the aromatic base ring perfectly parallel to that of a symmetry-equivalent Uri1R* residue (3.9 \u00c5 between planes), resulting in a very strong interaction ( Figure 3B ). Nucleoside Uri1R is connected with Gua2R by a phosphate-linker in extended conformation, and no interactions are observed between these two residues. Gua2R is also puckered as purely C 2 \u0408-endo, with its O 2 \u0408 atom stabilized by an interaction with the protein moiety (see below). The base, equally in syn conformation, is accommodated in a pocket in the inner pore surface and at the interface between protein protomers (see below). This pocket is formed by protein residues and by the perfectly parallel base plane of a symmetry-related Gua2R* residue.\n\nThe sugar-phosphate backbone folds back after Gua2R to reach Ade3R, so that both the guanine and adenine bases come to interact with each other, being approximately perpendicular (Gua2R N 2 -Ade3R N 1 , 2.9 \u00c5 ). A further interaction of the adenine is observed with the preceding phosphate group (Ade3R N 6 -Gua2R O2P, 3.3 \u00c5 ). The sugar puckering of this 3\u0408-terminal residue is C 3 \u0408-endo, enabling another interaction with the sugar of the preceding residue (Gua2R O 2 \u0408-Ade3R O 4 \u0408, 3.4 \u00c5 ), and the base is positioned in anti ( Figure 3B and Table 2 ).\n\nInside of the central cavity of the ring, the dimer-dimer interface is stabilized by the interaction with the ssRNA segment ( Figure 3A ). The main specificity of the observed trinucleotide binding resides in the central guanosine phosphate. The guanine base is placed in a deep pocket located at the interface between two protein protomers related by crystallographic symmetry (resi- double-headed salt bridge with Arg134* (Gua2R O 2 P-Arg134 N1, 2.9 \u00c5 ; Gua2R O 5 \u0408-Arg134 N2, 3.0 \u00c5 ), while the sugar moiety contacts the protein main chain (Gua2R O 2 \u0408-Gly126 N, 3.1 \u00c5 ) ( Figure 3C ) specific recognition of a single-stranded ribonucleotide segment, which dominates the interface ( Figure 3A ).\n\nThe RNA oligonucleotide is composed of a 5\u0408-phos-the protein octamer, and only hydrophobic forces are established by the aromatic base to the side chains of phate-depleted uridine residue (Uri1R, bound to molecule A), followed by a guanosine phosphate (Gua2R) Leu132* and Leu158*. The 3\u0408-terminal nucleotide Ade3R is placed in a shallow cavity lined out by the protein main and an adenosine phosphate (Ade3R) at the 3\u0408 end. Both termini are pointing into the interior of the pore, being chain (His123-Gly126) and the side chains of Tyr171, Asn154*, and Ile152*. It interacts directly via its base accessible for bulk solvent and, putatively, for 3\u0408-and/ or 5\u0408-elongated RNA molecules (Figures 1 and 3A) . The with the protein through one hydrogen bond (Ade3R N 1 -Asn154* N\u24262, 3.0 \u00c5 ) and via its sugar moiety through a high quality of the final electron density map, including the observed interactions, permitted unambiguous iden-second one (Ade3R O 2 \u0408-Gly126 O, 3.0 \u00c5 ) ( Figure 3C ). The observed structural features and the fact that the phosphate. Furthermore, the implication of the sugar O 2 \u0408 atoms in a number of key interactions (both intra-and protein oligomer was capable of sequestering a triribonucleotide of a particular sequence from the expression intermolecular) further permit to discard the potential binding of a trideoxyribonucleotide with an equivalent host E. coli strongly suggest that the octameric VP40 N-terminal domain displays a marked selectivity for the sequence. Therefore, the observed binding must be considered both RNA-and sequence-specific. In addi-specified sequence, in particular for a central guanosine Figure 5A, lane 2) . The Therefore, two conformational changes are observed to facilitate the transition from the monomer to the oc-same oligomeric form is observed when crystals belonging to space group P6 2 22 are dissolved and separated tamer. First, N-terminal residues 31 to 70, which pack in an extended conformation together with a 3 10 -helix under nonboiling conditions ( Figure 5A, lane 3) . This indicates that the SDS resistance is an intrinsic feature (helix 1) against the core of the \u2424 sandwich structure in the monomeric conformation, have to unfold and be of octameric ring-like VP40 in complex with RNA. In addition, monomeric VP40 adopts the same oligomeric expelled from the shallow cleft created by \u2424 strands 3 and 6 to allow the formation of the dimer-dimer interface SDS-resistant structure when incubated with 2 M urea in the presence of E. coli nucleic acids. The formation with its RNA binding pocket ( Figure 4B ). The N-terminal chain runs between \u2423 helix 2 and \u2424 strand 6 and both of ring-like structures was also confirmed by electron microscopy (data not shown). The oligomeric form of structural features move substantially in the oligomeric conformation ( Figure 4A ). In addition, the original chain SDS-resistant VP40 in complex with nucleic acids thus migrates above the 220 kDa marker protein ( Figure 5B ; direction from the monomeric form would also position the N terminus at the inside of the ring structure, which lane 1), while monomers and dimers are detected under boiling conditions ( Figure 5, lane 2) . may not be large enough to accommodate eight additional polypeptide chains.\n\nAnalysis of VP40 SDS resistance in cells infected with Ebola virus reveals that a fraction of the total protein also The second conformational change includes the Figure 5B, lanes 3 and 1) .\n\nThe binding of the ssRNA is typical for protein-RNA interactions with the characteristic parallel stacking of In addition, no dimeric form of VP40 can be detected in infected cells under either separation condition. This bases and aromatic residues, such as Phe125. As reported for many protein/RNA complexes, adenine is co-strongly indicates, together with the RNA binding properties of full-length oligomeric VP40 in vitro, that octa-ordinated by recognition of its N1 and N6 groups and the recognition of guanine involves arginines, a role that meric VP40 bound to a specific RNA sequence plays a role in the virus life cycle. We then analyzed purified is fulfilled by Arg134 [30]. Phe125 and Arg134 are the most important residues in the interaction and both are Ebola virus particles to determine whether octameric VP40 in complex with RNA is part of the virus particle. positioned next to each other and exposed close to the interface of the N-and C-terminal domains in the Separation of samples under boiled and nonboiled conditions produced mostly monomers and a band corre-monomeric conformation (see Figure 5C in [9]), which might implicate them in the transition process. Uracil at sponding to dimers of VP40. However, no high molecular weight band corresponding to the SDS-resistant form the 5\u0408 end is less well fixed by protein-RNA interactions; however, it is still unambiguously defined by electron detected in virus-infected cells could be detected, indicating that octameric VP40 might not be abundantly density and well coordinated by stacking against hydrophobic residues Leu132 and Leu158 as well as a present in virus particles ( Figure 5C ). symmetry-related uracil group, including polar interactions between neighboring uridines.

The unraveling of the strains (Musoke and Popp). We propose that this concrystal structure of octameric VP40 in complex with RNA servation is significant (34% identity between Ebola may suggest yet another still uncharacterized function\n\n[Zaire] and Marburg [Popp] VP40 NTDs), and it indicates for the matrix protein. The structure shows that VP40 that Marburg virus VP40 may also interact specifically has to undergo two major conformational changes in with nucleic acids. order to allow the observed oligomerization. This in-A number of RNA binding proteins form oligomers volves the movement of the C-terminal domain, which that assemble into ring-like structures with specific RNA had been suggested earlier [11] , as well as the displacebinding properties on the outside of a ring framework, ment of the N-terminal region (residues 31 to 70), which as in case of octameric rotavirus NSP2 [31] and TRAP then generates the binding pocket for the specific recog-(trp RNA binding attenuation protein) [32]. In addition, nition of the ssRNA motif U-G-A. Indeed, the octamer RNA recognition can also occur on the inside of the ring, as in the case of the Sm protein family, which assembles structure shows that the interface of the dimeric subunit [35] . The general function of binding multiple RNA copies could be as simple as are positioned underneath the viral membrane and ensure the integrity of mature viral particles. VP40 is a concentrating multiple copies at specific sites. In case of VP40, the binding of the RNA seems to follow an monomer in solution and contains two domains [9] . The N-terminal domain is involved in homo-oligomerization induced fit pathway, as suggested for general RNAprotein recognition [36], which evolved to accommodate [10] and interaction with cellular budding factors [16] [17] [18] , while the C-terminal domain is instrumental for mem-multiple functions within a single polypeptide chain by creating a symmetric homo-oligomer. The C-terminal brane association [10, 12] . The structure of octameric VP40 binds sequence-spe-domains, which are not present in the structure, could be still involved in membrane association and might cific ssRNA and represents the first crystal structure of a matrix protein from an enveloped virus in complex therefore localize specific action to membrane compartments as described for positive-strand RNA virus repli-with ssRNA. As the limiting size of a viral genome to be packaged into virus particles leads to evolutionary cation strategies [37].\n\nThe RNA ligand greatly stabilizes the dimer-dimer in-pressure to increase the coding content of the genome without changing its size, several conformations of VP40 terface, which is similar to the RNA-induced dimerization of rotavirus NSP3 [38]. VP40(31-212) shows SDS will therefore allow the matrix protein to exert multiple tasks. We provide evidence that the RNA bound form resistance when separated under nonboiling conditions on SDS-PAGE, which can be attributed to the presence of octameric VP40 is not an abundant component of the assembled particle, as its SDS-resistant form is only of nucleic acids in the sample [17, 56] \n\nThe octamer structure of VP40 now provides the framework for a precise functional analysis. In addition, the ular weight form is found in cells infected with Ebola virus. Although the amount present in these cells is low, presence of the octameric form of VP40 in infected cells together with the well-defined RNA binding pocket may it clearly indicates that this oligomeric form of VP40, which depends on RNA binding, is present in infected render VP40 a new target for antiviral drug development.\n\nis not present in virus particles, indicating a role distinct from the direct assembly of particles. We find, however, Expression and Crystallization a SDS-resistant dimeric form of VP40, which could be VP40(31-212) was expressed and purified as described [10] , and a C-terminally truncated form of VP40, VP40(31-194), was cloned, part of higher-order oligomers or hexamers as sug- (Table  1% Triton X-100 for 5 min at 4\u040aC and further treated as described 1) and all residues lie within the allowed regions of a Ramachandran above. plot, as checked with PROCHECK [49].\n\nGroup for support at the ESRF beamlines and S.
