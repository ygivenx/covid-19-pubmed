As of February 28, 2020, a total number of 79,251 patients has been infected in the mainland of China, with 2,835 (3.58%) deaths according to Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) report. Previous studies have mainly focus on the general epidemiological findings, clinical presentation, and clinical outcomes of mild and moderated patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia (3) (4) (5) . Only a recent study had reported the characteristics of critically ill patients in a single center in Wuhan with 61.5% mortality (6) . However, the clinical characteristics of critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) outside of Wuhan have not been described, especially in Guangdong Province, where by February 28, 2020 more than 1000 people were confirmed having coronavirus disease 2019 . Here, we describe the characteristics and treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Guangdong Province.\n\nThis multi-center, retrospective, observational study was designed and conducted by the \n\nThe patients were all confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time polymerase-chain-reaction testing of their throat swab specimens. Critically ill patients were defined as those required oxygen therapy to maintain peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) > 92% or PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio > 300 mmHg, symptoms of respiratory distress (including tachypnea > 22 breaths/min, labored breathing, use of intercostal muscles, and/or dyspnea at rest) or required mechanical ventilation (6) (7) (8) (9) . For the enrolled patients, their living status, intubation, weaning and ICU, hospital discharge date was confirmed on February 28, 2020.\n\nMedical records of critically ill patients in ICU were extracted and sent to the data collection center in the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University. A team of ICU doctors who had been treating patients with COVID-19 collected and reviewed the data. If information was not clear, the central working group contacted the doctor responsible for the treatment of the patient for clarification. Information recorded included demographic data, underlying conditions, symptoms, and laboratory and chest radiograph findings, comorbidities, intubation rates, ventilator settings prior to and during ICU therapy.\n\nIncidence of SARS-CoV-2 related comorbidities were identified, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis shock, cardiac injury, acute kidney injury (AKI), liver dysfunction and gastrointestinal haemorrhage. ARDS was diagnosed according Berlin definition (10) and sepsis shock was identified by Sepsis-3 definition (11) . AKI was identified on the basis and elevated of serum creatinine (12). Cardiac injury was recognized by increased cardiac troponin I or electrocardiography abnormalities of nonspecific ST-T wave (13, 14) . Liver dysfunction was defined by aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase greater than 40 U/L (15) . Gastrointestinal haemorrhage was identified by a positive fecal or gastric juice occult blood test (16) .\n\nContinuous variables were presented as either mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) or median with interquartile range (IQR), in accordance with either normal or non-normal distributions. For categorical variables, the frequency and percentage of patients in each category were calculated.\n\nThe differences were assessed between intubated and non-intubated patients with two-sample t test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test depending on parametric or nonparametric data for continuous variables and Chi-square test for categorical variables. Spearman correlation coefficient was used to test the correlations between clinical variables. All analyses were performed using SPSS 23.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A P value < 0.05 (two-sided) was considered statistically significant.\n\nDemographic, Epidemiologic, and Baseline Characteristics of the Patients A total of 45 critically ill patients were identified with SARS-CoV-2 infections, the first case included was confirmed on January 14, 2020, and the last one was confirmed on February 20, 2020. All patients had positive throat swabs of SARS-CoV-2 and bilateral infiltrates on chest radiographs ( Figure 1 ) and were admitted to ICUs. \n\nThe most common symptoms were fever (86.7%), cough (71.1%) and dyspnoea (64.4%). White cell counts was at a normal range with predominantly neutrophils in intubated patients.\n\nThere were 41 patients (91.1%) presented with lymphopenia (lymphocyte < 1.0*10 9 /L).\n\nCompared with non-intubated patients, those intubated showed significant decrease in lymphocyte (p < 0.001). Elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (normal range, 109-255 U/L) were observed in 32 of the patients (71.1%). Moreover, intubated patients had higher levels of LDH than those without intubation (p = 0.0012). Spearman correlation analyses showed that SOFA score were negatively correlated with lymphocyte count and positively associated with LDH (Spearman's rho= -0.57 and 0.51, respectively, P<0.001) ( Figure 2 ). In addition, prothrombin time, troponin I, creatine kinase, serum creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate, procalcitonin and All rights reserved.

Antifungal agents were given to 19 (42.2%) patients. A total of 21 (46.7%) patients had received glucocorticoids, 28 (62.2%) with immunoglobulin and 35 (77.8%) with albumin. Further, convalescent plasma was applied in 6 (13.3%) critically ill patients.\n\nThere were 13 (28.9%) patients treated with high-flow nasal cannula, 6 (13.3%) with non-invasive mechanical ventilation, 20 (44.4%) with invasive mechanical ventilation. For patients with intubation, tidal volumes of 7.0 mL/kg predicted body weight was applied in accordance with lung protective ventilation strategy (17) . Recruitment maneuvers were administered in 6 patients (13.3%). A total of 5 patients (11.1%) received prone position ventilation. In addition, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was applied in 9 (20.0%) and 4 (8.9%) patients, respectively. There were 15 (33.3%) patients administrated with vasoconstrictive agents, 19 (42.2%) with sedation and analgesia and 8 (17.8%) with neuromuscular blocking agents (table 4).\n\nAs of February 28, 2020, one patient had died. Seven patients were successfully weaned from invasive ventilation. A total of 23 patients (51.1%) have discharged from ICU. Moreover, 11 patients (24.4%) have been recovered and discharged from hospital (table 4).\n\nIn order to identify the potential risks for intubation in severe patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, Chi-square test showed that older (age > 60 years), higher SOFA (> 4), APACHE II (> 15) score and LDH (> 255U/L)and lower lymphocyte (< 0.8*10 9 /L) at ICU admission were at high risks for intubation.

The findings showed that the majority of the patients were seriously ill at ICU admission. Of all included patients, 37 (82.2%) had developed ARDS, 20 (44.4%) required invasive mechanical ventilation and 9 (20.0%) required ECMO, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe illness.\n\nOur study population might represent most of the clinical characteristics of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Lymphocytopenia occurred in more than 90% of critically ill patients, which was similar in Wuhan cohort (6) . Moreover, we found that intubated patients had significantly lower lymphocyte counts than without intubation. Chi-square test had shown lower lymphocyte counts was more likely to be at high risk for intubation. Spearman correlation analyses showed that lymphocyte count was significantly negatively correlated with SOFA score at ICU admission. In fact, lymphocytopenia was common in viral pneumonia, particular in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (18, 19) . It was reported that lymphocyte < 0.8*10 9 /L was an independent risk factor for 90-day mortality of viral pneumonia (20) . Therefore, lymphocytopenia may reflect the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Dynamic monitoring lymphocyte would be of clinical benefit for intensive caring the critical illness.\n\nAlthough antiviral drugs, including osehamivir and ribavirin had been applied to our patients, to date no effective antiviral to treat COVID-19 has been identified. The current approach to clinical management is general supportive care supplemented with critical care and organ support when necessary. It has been suggested that the administration of high-titer anti-influenza immune plasma derived from convalescent or immunized individuals may be clinically beneficial for the treatment of SARS, MERS and seasonal influenza (21) (22) (23) . Convalescent plasma was a potential treatment in coronavirus infection and suggested using in COVID-19 (24). Therefore, convalescent plasma of COVID-19 was applied in 6 patients (13.3%) and no transfusion reactions occurred in our cohort. However, according to our data, at this point, our findings could not All rights reserved.

In addition, many of our patients developed extrapulmonary organ dysfunction including sepsis shock, acute liver dysfunction, and acute renal injury. As of February 28, 2020, the mortality of our critically ill cases of COVID-19 were 2.2%\n\n(1 of 45) in our cohort, which was lower than those (61.5%, 32 of 52) in Wuhan. The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 led to more than 65,000 infected patients in Wuhan (CCDC report on February 28, 2020). The massive infux of patients, inadequately protective clothing and medical personnel, particularly in critical care resources, may account for the unacceptable high mortality in Wuhan.\n\nIn contrast, protective clothing and medical personnel could cover the relative less patients in Guangdong Province. In addition, a well design Web-based video consultation system for critically ill patients with COVID-19 was established and applied across different cities in Guangdong Province. Then specialists in critical care medicine could share their experience and help the management of the critical illness in a remote way across hospitals and cities. Moreover, aggressive treatments and intensive care were applied for the severe patients, including convalescent plasma, invasive mechanical ventilation, CRRT, ECMO. Therefore, the mortality was relatively lower in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Guangdong Province.\n\nOur study has several limitations. Firstly, only 45 critically ill patients with COVID-19 were included from Guangdong Province. It might be that more clinical features related to those critically illness will be identified, if other provinces get involved. Secondly, at the time of study submission, half of the patients had not been discharged from ICU, so we are unable to estimate either ICU stay, ventilation free day, the case fatality rate or the predictors of fatality.
