{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Multi-omics Evaluation of Gastrointestinal and Other Clinical Characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 Multi-omics Evaluation of Gastrointestinal and Other Clinical Characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19", "body": "Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has produced a worldwide panic. Except for a principal human to human transmission method by droplet and contact, there is still limited knowledge about possible alternate transmission methods to guide clinical care. Recent clinical studies have observed digestive symptoms in COVID-19 patients 1 , possibly because of the enrichment and infection of SARS-CoV-2 in the gastrointestinal tract, mediated by virus receptor of angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) 2 , which suggests the potential for a fecaloral route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission 3, 4 . However, there is still a large gap in the biological knowledge of COVID-19. In this study, via a bulk-to-cell strategy focusing on ACE2, we performed an integrated omics analysis at the genome, transcriptome and proteome levels in bulk tissues and single cells across species to decipher the potential routes for SARS-CoV-2 infection in depth.\n\nClinical and epidemiological data of COVID-19 patients were collected from a continually updated resource 5 . The transcriptome and proteome derived from bulk tissues and cells were accessed from multiple databases. A Phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) dataset was supplied for genetic analysis on the ACE2 pathway. P values were calculated from t-test and gene-set analysis. More details are shown in Supplementary Methods.\n\nWe constructed a user-friendly interface for visualization of clinical symptoms of COVID-19 (https://mulongdu.shinyapps.io/map_covid/; Supplementary Figure 1 ). Fever was the most common symptom at onset of illness (>70%). Notably, 5.13% and 3.34% of patients had recorded digestive symptoms from Hubei and the outside (Supplementary Table 1 ), respectively; 1.67% of asymptomatic carriers were recorded with positive SARS-CoV-2.\n\nAs shown in Figure 1 , ACE2 was widely expressed across tissues. ACE2 was considered intestine-specific, as its expression was enriched more than fourfold in intestinal tract ( Figure 1A ) compared with other tissues. The protein detection supported the activity of ACE2 in digestive, excretory and reproductive organs ( Figure 1A) . A similar expression pattern could be found in extra datasets (Figure 1B-D) . However, ACE2 expression was mild in the lung.\n\nWe further performed cell-specific analysis to decipher the expression pattern of ACE2 in target organs. ACE2 mRNA in the intestinal cell lines was significantly higher than that in the lung cell lines (P = 2.88 \u00d7 10 -6 ; Figure 1E ) but did not differ significantly between the kidney and lung cell lines. Moreover, the mean values of ACE2 protein in both the intestinal (0.31) and kidney (0.61) cell lines were higher than those in the lung (-0.26), although no significant difference among the cells ( Figure 1F ).\n\nIn colonic tissue microenvironments, ACE2 exhibited significantly higher expression in epithelia than that in stroma (P = 4.60 \u00d7 10 -8 in treatment A; P = 8.81 \u00d7 10 -7 in treatment B; Figure 1G) ; however, intriguingly, there was no significant difference in ACE2 mRNA between aspirin intervention and placebo ( Figure 1G ).\n\nSubsequently, we carried out single-cell analysis to dissect the ACE2 expression pattern. ACE2 was enriched specifically in enterocytes of mice small intestine epithelia (Supplementary Figure 2A-B) , which was consistent with the findings in humans 6 . ACE2 was highly concentrated in epithelia at renal proximal tubule in both human and mouse (Supplementary Figure 2C -E).\n\nWe obtained 7 phenotypes related to the intestinal tract and kidney deposited in the PheWAS dataset, and extracted GWAS summary statistics with over 3,000 SNPs assigned to 33 genes of the ACE2 pathway for the gene-set analysis (Supplementary Table 2 Figure 3 ). In the pathway-based level, we found no significant genetic association of the ACE2 pathway with 7 phenotypes, but a modest performance of prediction model in nephrotic syndrome (AUC = 0.607; Supplementary Table 3 ). Partitioned to the gene-based level, the significant joint effect of each gene extended across different phenotypes (Supplementary Table 3 ). In the disorders of digestive and excretory systems, TGFB1 was associated with colorectal cancer, ACE and MAPK3 with nephrotic syndrome, and KLK1 and KNG1 with urolithiasis. Similarly, in the blood test parameters, ACE2, along with ENPEP, exhibited a significant association only with Alb.\n\nOn the basis of prior evidence suggesting that ACE2 mediated the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells 2 , we previously found that ACE2 expression was significantly higher in smokers than in non-smokers, especially in distinct lung cell types 7 , corroborated by the clinical observation that the severe COVID-19 cases were more likely to have a smoking history (22.1%) than the non-severe COVID-19 (13.1%) 1 . In this study, ACE2 was confirmed to be enriched in epithelia of intestinal tract; therefore, a mutual interaction potentially occurred that SARS-CoV-2 disrupted ACE2 activity, infected the intestinal epithelium by its cytotoxicity and shed into feces, resulting in gastrointestinal manifestations and/or positive SARS-CoV-2 in stool 4, 8 . Considering the physiological renew of intestinal epithelia every 4-5 days, our results warn that more attention must be given to the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 especially by asymptomatic carriers.\n\nThe renal proximal tubule enriched in ACE2 indicated that viral shedding in the urine was feasible; however, no evidence supported the actual detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the urine 4 . Nevertheless, renal impairment was common in severe COVID-19 patients 1 , which could be supported by the potential that SARS-CoV-2 damaged renal tubular cells and induced the disruption of the ACE2 pathway referring to ACE2, ACE, ENPEP, TGFB1, THOP1, MAS1 and NLN involved in kidney dysfunction.\n\nIn summary, ACE2 enriched in the intestinal tract and kidney, more specifically in the epithelium, could mediate the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells to accumulate and cause cytotoxicity, but do not respond to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. It is reasonable to emphasize the monitoring of digestive and excretory system complications in COVID-19 cases and the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via the fecal-oral route by suspected cases and the asymptomatic carriers (Supplementary Figure 4) .\n\nThis study was supported by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (Public Health and Preventive Medicine). At the mRNA level, in combined data from HPA, GTEx and FANTOM5, the top five tissues included those from three digestive organs (intestinal tract), along with the kidney and testis, indicating the intestine specificity of ACE2 (with NX values of 122, 49.1 and 46 in small intestinal, colon and duodenum, respectively). The line represented the NX value of ACE2 across all tissues. At the protein level, in samples from HPA, 9 tissues were stained with ACE2, among which 5 tissues were highly stained, including tissues from two digestive organs (duodenum and small intestine), and 4 tissues were minimally stained, including tissues from digestive organs (colon and rectum). Furthermore, similar to ACE2 mRNA, ACE2 protein was enriched in the kidney and testis. The bar indicated the immunohistochemical results for ACE2 protein. Antibody staining was reported as not detected, low, medium, or high, and the score was based on the staining intensity and fraction of stained cells. .08 \u00b1 4.02) was higher than that in the lung cell lines (n = 194; -5.00 \u00b1 3.51; ****, P = 2.88 \u00d7 10 -6 ), but there was no significant difference between the kidney (n = 32; -4.92 \u00b1 3.59) and lung cell lines. (F) At the protein level, the differences in ACE2 expression among the intestinal (n = 3; 0.31 \u00b1 1.94), kidney (n = 3; 0.61 \u00b1 1.31) and lung (n = 13; -0.26 \u00b1 0.89) cell lines were not statistically significant (ns, no significance). Mean \u00b1 SD. Both mRNA and protein expressions were adjusted by the global normalization. GSE71571 (G) provided gene expression profiles in the epithelial and stromal cells of normal colon in 44 healthy individuals recruited for an aspirin intervention trial. Briefly, participants were randomly assigned to the order in which they received treatment A or treatment B, respectively (The type of treatment includes aspirin type active and placebo but is masked. By the note, unblinding is needed to contact the study authors directly). Paired t-test was used for the comparison of ACE2 mRNA between epithelial and stromal cells (****, P = 4.60 \u00d7 10 -8 in treatment A; ****, P = 8.81 \u00d7 10 -7 in treatment B). Unpaired t-test was applied for the comparison of ACE2 mRNA between treatment A and B (ns, no significance). More details are shown in Supplementary Methods.\n\nThe clinical and epidemiological data of COVID-19 patients were collected from a continually updated resource (https://tinyurl.com/s6gsq5y) 1 , including 26,357 cases worldwide. The analyzed dataset was downloaded at Feb 23th, 2020, which enrolled 14,729 confirmed cases from Hubei, Wuhan province and 11,628 cases from the outside of Hubei around the world. The visualization of symptoms of COVID-19 cases worldwide was built using plotly and shiny in R library.\n\nThe consensus Normalized eXpression (NX) value of ACE2 mRNA was extracted from the combined transcriptomics datasets by Human Protein Atlas (HPA) 2 , The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) 3 and The Functional Annotation of The Mammalian Genome (FANTOM5) 4 , which enrolled 55 tissue types and 6 blood cell types. Briefly, HPA provided transcriptome and proteome profiles across approximately 40 kinds of cells, tissues and organs in the human body; and grouped genes into categories describing the tissue specificity. GTEx project collected samples from 54 non-diseased tissue sites across nearly 1,000 individuals. FANTOM5 project supplied transcriptome data for every major human organ and over 200 cancer cell lines.\n\nThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) also supplied transcriptome profiles derived from bulk tissues. We extracted ACE2 mRNA in normal tissues from both TCGA spanning 33 cancer types deposited in Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) platform 5 ; and GEO including major organs (GSE2361 6 , GSE7905 7 and GSE71571 8 ). We further grouped cells into the subtypes intestine, kidney and lung according to the cell progenitor using the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) dataset and performed differential expression analysis for ACE2 mRNA and protein across each subgroup using t-test. CCLE project provided omics data, including transcriptome 9 and proteome 10 covering 1,100 cell lines.\n\nWe used Single Cell Expression Atlas (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/home) and Kidney Interactive Transcriptomics (http://humphreyslab.com/SingleCell/) to visualize the expression pattern of ACE2 mRNA in each cell cluster of intestinal tract and kidney. Briefly, single-cell RNA-seq of intestinal and kidney tissues were carried out using the InDrop, DropSeq or 10\u00d7 Chromium platforms, and the distribution of ACE2 was shown in the cell subgroups derived from both humans (including 4,524 nuclei in complete kidney tissues 11 and 4,259 nuclei in kidney epithelia 12 ) and mice (including 1,522 cells in small intestinal epithelia 13 and 11,395 cells and nuclei in kidney epithelia 14 ) .\n\nThe key pathways containing ACE2 were accessed from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG; Renin-angiotensin system; hsa04614) and PathCards (ACE Inhibitor Pathway, Pharmacodynamics SuperPath). Considering that TMPRSS2 could cooperate with ACE2 to enable the virus to enter the host cells 15 , we ultimately included 33 genes in the ACE2 network for further genetic analysis (Supplementary Table 2) , among which ACE2, ATP6AP2 and AGTR2 were located on chromosome X. The ACE2 pathway network was constructed using STRING (https://string-db.org/; Supplementary Figure 3 ). Genomic information for the candidate genes was extracted from NCBI assembly by GRCh 37 (Supplementary Table 2) . The 1000 Genomes Projects (Phase 3) provided the genetic information for each gene, along with the following quality control criteria for selecting genetic variants underlying east Asian ancestry (CHB: Han Chinese in Beijing, China; JPT: Japanese in Tokyo, Japan): minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.01, P value for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium > 1.0 \u00d7 10 -6 and genotyping call rate > 95%.\n\nConsidering that almost all COVID-19 cases have been in China, we utilized the largest Asian PheWAS database, Japanese ENcyclopedia of GEnetic associations by Riken (JENGER) 16, 17 , to evaluate the genetic effect of the ACE2 pathway on the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 and the disease process that occur in ACE2 enriched tissues. Over 200 traits or diseases with related genome-wide association studies (GWASs) were deposited in JENGER, of which the summary statistics were calculated by logistic or linear regression analysis for the association between each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and phenotypes. When mapping the phenotypes related to the intestinal tract and kidney deposited in the PheWAS dataset, we used colorectal cancer, nephrotic syndrome and urolithiasis for candidate digestive and excretory system diseases. Besides, we considered the blood test parameters, including the Albumin/globulin ratio (AG) and the Albumin (Alb), C-reactive protein (CRP) and Total protein (TP) concentrations, as reflections of patients' health condition in terms of the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 18 .\n\nTo avoid unexplainable and weak effects of a single genetic variant on a phenotype, we thus performed gene-set analysis using Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation (MAGMA) 19 , which aggregated genetic variants into candidate gene or pathway sets, to evaluate and predict the phenotypes susceptibility. We also used SummaryAUC (AUC, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) to evaluate the performance of polygenic risk prediction models in binary outcome underlying summary statistics 20 .\n\nAll public database involved in human participants were approved by the ethics committees of original studies; and this study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Nanjing Medical University (NJMUIRB -2020-020).
