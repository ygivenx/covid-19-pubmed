{"title": "An efficient three-component, one-pot synthesis of 2-alkylthio-4-amino-5-cyano-6-aryl(alkyl)pyrimidines in water", "body": "Pyrimidine is an important heterocyclic scaffold that has attracted considerable attention in medicinal chemistry. Many pyrimidines and pyrimidine-fused heterocyclic derivatives have shown diverse biological activities, such as adenosine kinase inhibitors [1] , selective dihydrofolate reductase (from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Plasmodium falciparum) inhibitors [2] [3] [4] , SecA inhibitors [5] , VEGF-R2 inhibitors [6] , SARS-CoV 3CL protease inhibitors [7] , HIV-1 [8] , adenosine receptor and growth hormone secretagogue receptor antagonists [9, 10] , and antimicrobial activity [11] [12] [13] . In addition to their pharmacological activities, some of them also exhibit interesting fluorescent properties [14] .\n\nPolyfunctional-substituted pyrimidines (PFSPs) play an important role in the preparation of substituted pyrimidine and pyrimidine-fused heterocyclic derivatives through the transformation of functional substituents on the pyrimidine scaffold. Therefore, many methods have been developed for the synthesis of PFSPs, and various substituted pyrimidine and pyrimidine-fused heterocyclic derivatives have been prepared from these PFSPs [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] 15 ].\n\n2-Alkylthio-4-amino-5-cyano-6-aryl(alkyl) pyrimidines represent one kind of the important PFSPs, and their pyrimidine and pyrimidine-fused heterocyclic derivatives were found to have special pharmacological activities. For example, derivatives of A exhibit topoisomerase II inhibitory activity against filarial parasite Setaria Cervi [16] , compounds B show DPP-IV inhibitory activity against type 2 diabetes [17, 18] , and compounds C display adenosine A2a receptor agonistic activity for treating glaucoma [19] . The pyrimidine-fused heterocyclic compounds D and E are PDK1 inhibitors and TLR modulators, respectively ( Fig. 1 ) [20] [21] [22] . To the best of our knowledge, there are mainly two methods for the synthesis of 2-alkylthio-4-amino-5-cyano-6aryl(alkyl)pyrimidines [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] , as shown in Scheme 1. Both require at least 2-3 synthetic steps using organic solvents under heating, which requires a tedious work-up, there is a limitation in reactant/substrates, and the method offers unsatisfactory yields. To alleviate all these drawbacks, a more efficient PFSPs synthesis is highly desirable.\n\nMulticomponent one-pot reaction represents an attractive alternative for the formation of multiple bonds in a single reaction giving access to complex molecules without the need of isolation or purification of reaction intermediates [30, 31] . In our continuing efforts to develop multicomponent one-pot synthesis of various heterocycles [32] [33] [34] , we here report an efficient synthesis of 2-alkylthio-4-amino-5cyano-6-aryl(alkyl)pyrimidine derivatives from the one-pot three-component condensation of aldehydes, malononitrile, and S-alkylisothiouronium salts in water.\n\nIn our previous study, we developed an efficient synthesis of highly substituted pyridines via a three-component, onepot reaction of aldehydes, malononitrile, and S-alkyliso-thiouronium salts in water [32, 33] . Interestingly, we also obtained minor amounts of 2-alkylthio-4-amino-5-cyano-6-aryl(alkyl)pyrimidine as a byproduct in the above reaction. This discovery prompted us to explore the possibility of developing this side reaction into a more optimized method to synthesize 2-alkylthio-4-amino-5-cyano-6-aryl (alkyl)pyrimidines.\n\nWe first studied the model reaction of benzaldehyde, malonoitrile, and S-methylisothiourea sulfate to optimize the reaction conditions and the results are listed in Table 1 . Referring to the reaction conditions in our previous study [32] [33] [34] , when equal amounts of each reactant were reacted in water at room temperature using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as the additive, we found that a strong base (e.g., NaOH) was unfa- vorable for the reaction (entry 1), organic amines (entries 2 and 3) worked better than weak inorganic bases (entries 4 and 5), and that using triethylamine as the base gave the best yield (entry 2, 50 % yield). The presence of SDS was not necessary in this reaction (entries 2 and 6). The stoichiometry of Et 3 N was essential and 4 equivalents of Et 3 N gave the best yield (entries 2, 7, 8). Increasing the reaction temperature decreased the yield significantly, which may be due to the decomposition of the intermediates at higher temperature (entries 13 and 14). Using organic solvents in the reaction did not increase yields (entries 9-12), due to poor solubility of the S-alkylisothiouronium salts. Fortunately, it was found that when the amount of aldehyde was increased slightly from 1 to 1.1 equivalent better yields were achieved (entries [14] [15] [16] [17] .\n\nHaving optimized the reaction conditions for the model system (Table 1 , entry 15), we then proceeded to explore the scope and limitations of this three-component, one-pot reaction ( Table 2) . We first examined the influence of different aromatic heterocyclic aldehydes, with malononitrile and S-methylisothiouronium sulfate to give the corresponding 2-methylthio-4-amino-5-cyano-6-aryl(alkyl)pyrimidines in moderate to good yields (entries 1-17). The electronic property and position of the substituents on the aldehydes had an impact on the reaction. In general, substitution at 3-or 4-position with electron withdrawing groups was more favorable for the reaction than that at 3-or 4-position with electron donating groups, and substitution at 2-position was unfavorable for the reaction (entries 8, 10). Using acetaldehyde as an example of an aliphatic aldehyde was also examined, which afforded the desired product 3r in 35 % yield (entry 18).\n\nThe scope of this method was further investigated through the reaction of pyridine-3-carboxaldehyde and malononitrile with various S-alkylisothiouronium salts under the same reaction conditions(entries [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . The results showed that all reactions proceeded smoothly to afford the 2-alkylthio-4-amino-5-cyano-6-(3-pyridinyl)pyrimidines in 54-74 % yield.\n\nIt is worth pointing out that due to the mild reaction conditions, this reaction can tolerate a wide range of functional groups, including nitro, amino, cyano, hydoxyl, methoxy, halide, and alkene. This advantage makes our method a very powerful tool for the synthesis of PFSPs, which could be transformed into structurally diverse substituted pyrimidines and pyrimidine-fused heterocyclic derivatives. Furthermore, this procedure does not require the separation and purification of intermediates and uses water as the reaction medium, which is environmentally friendly.\n\nTo demonstrate the application of 2-alkylthio-4-amino-5cyano-6-(3-pyridinyl)pyrimidines in the synthesis of pyrimidine derivatives, we have successfully constructed two [20] [21] [22] .\n\nIn summary, we have developed a convenient and practical method for the synthesis of 2-alkylthio-4-amino-5-cyano-6-aryl(alkyl) pyrimidines via a three-component, one-pot reaction of aldehyde with malononitrile and S-alkylisothiouronium salt in water at room temperature. The environmentally friendly reaction condition and a broad substrate scope will make this method widely applicable in the synthesis of structurally diverse pyrimidines and pyrimidine-fused heterocyclic derivatives.\n\nMelting point data were recorded on an X-4 micromelting point instrument and uncorrected. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III 400 NMR spectrometer in CDCl 3 or DMSO-d 6 ( 1 H at 400 MHz and 13 C at 101 MHz) using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal standard. HRMS were recorded on Bruker Apex IV FTMS. IR were recorded using NEXUS-470 FTIR (Nicolet). Column chromatography was performed on silica gel (zcx.II; 200-300 mesh). All reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Tetrahydrofuran was dried over sodium.\n\nGeneral procedure for the synthesis of 3a-3w\n\nMalononitrile (1 mmol) and S-alkylisothiouronium salt (2 mmol) were dissolved in 20 mL water and then the aldehyde (1.1 mmol) and Et 3 N (4 mmol) were added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 6-24 h. The endpoint of the reaction was monitored by TLC. The resulting mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (1 \u00d7 10 mL), and the combined organic layers were dried over Na 2 SO 4 and concentrated in vacuo. Purification of the resulting residue by column chromatography (petroleum ether/EtOAc, 8:1-6:1, v/v) afforded the desired products 3a-3o and 3r-3w. To get the products 3p and 3q, at the end of the reaction the resulting mixture were filtered, and the precipitates were dried and recrystallized (EtOAc/MeOH, 1:1, v/v). In cases where the reactant aldehyde is solid, a minor amount of ethyl acetate was used to first dissolve it before its addition. \n\nObtained \n\nObtained in 54 % yield; yellow power crystal; mp 187- \n\nCompound 3j (2 mmol) was dissolved in 20 mL anhydrous THF at room temperature.
