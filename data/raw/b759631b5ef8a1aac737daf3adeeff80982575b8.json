{"title": "", "body": "Sir, I read the recent publication on feline coronavirus (FCoV) by Sharif et al 1 with great interest. Sharif et al reached the conclusion that 'The overall prevalence of FCoV infection was 84%' in Malaysia. 1 Focusing on another Asian country, the reported prevalence in Turkey was about 60%. 2 The data are interesting; the more common infection rate might be due to the tropical nature of Malaysia. However, the data might have low clinical implications due to the small numbers of subjects and differences in diagnostic techniques. Nevertheless, the high prevalence also implies risk for future possible zoonosis of the coronavirus to human beings. 3 "}
