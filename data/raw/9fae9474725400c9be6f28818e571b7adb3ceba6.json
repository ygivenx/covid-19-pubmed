{"title": "Characterization of the Receptor-binding Domain of Ebola Glycoprotein in Viral Entry *", "body": "Ebola viruses are enveloped viruses with an ~19 kb single-stranded RNA genome containing 7 genes. The GP gene encodes two glycoproteins, a secreted form called sGP and a transmembrane form called GP which is generated by RNA editing [34, 35, 44] . GP is responsible for viral entry, including attachment of viruses to the target cells and fusion of the virus-cell membranes [43, 48, 49] . GP is modified by N-linked glycosylation in the Endoplasmic Reticulum to form PreGP, and further undergoes O-linked glycosylation in Golgi to become mature GP [10] .\n\nEbola GP processing by proteases has been well documented. First, the N-terminal signal peptide (32 residues) of GP is cleaved cotranslationally. The GP precursor is then cleaved into GP1 and GP2 in trans-Golgi by a furin-like cellular protease, and GP1 and GP2 are linked by disulfide bonding [14, 36, 45] .\n\nAlthough the cleavage site between GP1 and GP2 is conserved among the Ebola species, this cleavage event appears not required for Ebola entry [13, 28, 29, 49] .\n\nLastly, GP was shown to be cleaved at D637 by the tumor necrosis factor \u03b1-converting enzyme (TACE) to shed the truncated GP from the surface of infected cells [7] . In addition to these cleavage events during GP maturation, two intracellular proteases, Cathepsin B and L, residing in the endosomes, have been shown to process GP1 into an 18-19 kDa fragment during viral entry [5, 16, 37] . The endosomal cleavage appears to be critical on viral entry. It is interesting to note that these endosomal proteases play a role in entry of other viruses [9, 12, 30, 31, 39] Many cellular proteins have been implicated in facilitating Ebola entry, including asialoglycoprotein receptor, folate receptor \u03b1, dendritic cell-specific ICAM3 grabbing non-integrin, liver/lymph node-specific ICAM3 grabbing non-integrin, human macrophage galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine-specific C-type lectin, and Tyro3 receptor kinase family [1, 4, 8, 22, 32, 33, 38, 42] .\n\nHowever, none of them seems to be absolutely required for the entry. Interestingly, expression of Ebola GP on the target cells can specifically enhance Ebola GP-mediated viral entry [23] .\n\nThe N-terminal 200 residues of GP1 are relatively conserved compared to the highly variable C-terminal mucin-like domain (MUC, amino acids 309~476). The MUC region is heavily modified by O-and N-linked glycosylation. It has been shown that MUC is responsible for the cytopathic effects induced by GP expression, but it is dispensable for GP-mediated viral entry, at least in tissue culture using pseudotyping systems [14, 24, 40, 50] . Previous studies have shown that the N-terminal region of GP1 (approximately 150 residues in length after cleavage of the signal peptide)\n\nis critical for receptor binding, which is referred to as the receptor-binding domain, or RBD [3, 24] . Extensive mutational analyses have been performed to characterize the roles of RBD residues in protein folding and function in viral entry. In this report, we examined the roles of the RBD residues by substitutions in protein expression, virion incorporation, and viral entry [3, 14, 24, 26] .\n\nBy entry interference assay and binding assay, we identified several key residues involved in receptor binding and the post-binding steps in viral entry. In addition, the results further substantiated the notion that Ebola and Marburg viruses use the same or similar receptor.\n\nHuman embryonic kidney cells 293T were main- The mouse monoclonal antibody, 12B5-1-1, which recognizes the GP1 of Ebola Zaire GP, was kindly provided by Dr. Mary K. Hart [47] . The mouse anti-HIV p24 monoclonal antibody was obtained from NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program [41] .\n\nMouse anti-\u03b2 actin antibody, goat anti-mouse IgG HRP, and anti-human IgG FITC were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis).\n\nEbola Zaire glycoprotein gene was synthesized by multiple rounds of overlapping PCR based on the Ebola Zaire genome sequence (GenBank accession number L11365 [15] ). \u2206Mucin GP was constructed by PCR-directed mutagenesis. All alanine substitution mutations of GP gene were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using Stratagene's Quick-Change Mutagenesis kit according to supplier's protocols.\n\nAll mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing of flanking regions (on average approximately 500 bp).\n\nPseudotyped viruses were produced by cotansfecting DNA of wt GP or mutants with Envdeficient HIV vector carrying a firefly luciferase reporter gene [6, 11] into producer cells. Briefly, 2\u03bcg DNA of wt GP or mutants and 2\u03bcg of pNL4-3-Luc-R --Ewere used to transfect 293T cells (90% \n\nTo evaluate the incorporation of wt GP protein or mutants into the pseudotyped viruses, 2 mL of Ebola GP protein or mutants was detected by Western blotting as described above. Mouse anti-HIV p24 monoclonal antibody (1:5 000 dilution) was used as the primary antibody to detect the HIV p24 protein.\n\nHuman 293T cells (3\u00d710 5 cells) were seeded in six-well plates one day prior to infection. These \n\nTo construct plasmids carrying a \u0394mucin GP gene (with mutation), PshAI-BamHI fragment of fulllength Ebola GP gene (with mutation) in pcDNA3.1(+) was replaced by PshAI-BamH I fragment of \u0394mucin Ebola GP gene. \u0394mucin GP gene with/without mutation in these plasmids was amplified by PCR and inserted between BamH I and Xho I sites of the HIV vector, pHR'-CMV-Luc [equal to pHR' in [27] ], to replace luciferase gene. GFP or puromycin-resistant gene (puro) was used to replace the luciferase gene in the same vector to construct pHR'-CMV-GFP and pHR'-CMV-puro.\n\nHuman 293T cells in 6-well plate were transfected with 0.25 \u03bcg of VSV-G plasmid encoding VSV-G protein, 1\u03bcg of HIV-trans plamsid encoding HIV structural protein gag-pol [equal to pCMV\u0394R8.2 in [27] ], and 1 \u03bcg of pHR'.CMV plasmid carrying different genes (GFP, puro, or wt/mutant \u0394mucin GP).\n\nThe supernatants containing pseudotyped viruses were \n\nTo study direct binding of Ebola GP to cells, the gene encoding a fusion protein (Ebola receptorbinding domain [RBD] fused to Fc of human IgG) was constructed and the fusion protein was purified.\n\nNhe I-BamH I fragment of S1-hIgG [17] \n\nPrevious work on the conserved hydrophobic and charged residues in GP1 has shown that most of the residues involved in protein folding or viral entry are at the N-terminus. This suggests that the N-terminal region of approximately 150 residues (aa consists of an important domain of GP, receptorbinding domain, or RBD [24] . To further dissect RBD in viral entry, mutational analysis was carried out to study other residues in this domain. In total, 41 single alanine substitutions were generated on Ebola GP.\n\nThe wild type (wt) or mutant GP plasmid was cotransfected with an Env-deficient HIV vector (pNL4-3\n\nLuc.R-E-) into 293T cells to produce pseudotyped viruses as described [24] . 293T cells were challenged by these viruses. Infected cells were lysed 48 h post-infection, and luciferase activities were measured as an indicator of entry efficiency of different pseudotyped viruses, as previously described [24] .\n\nWestern blot analysis was used to determine protein expression in 293T cells and GP incorporation on HIV particles.\n\nOnly four of the forty-one substitutions (V52A, V66A, F160A, and V181A) appeared to show low levels of protein expression and/or virion incorporation, which led to impaired GP phenotype in mediating viral entry (Fig. 1) . The lower amount of V52A, V66A, and V181A GP incorporated onto virions compared to that of wt GP could explain the inefficient viral entry (29%, 44%, and 15% of wt).\n\nLow expression of F160A GP led to low virion incorporation and viral entry (2% of wt). In contrast, none of the remaining 37 mutant GPs showed a major defect in protein expression and GP incorporation.\n\nAmong them, two (T60A and V79A) were defective in mediating viral entry (~30% of wt), suggesting that T60 and V79 are involved in receptor binding or post-binding steps. In addition, two substitutions (T42A and N61A) did not have major effect on GP expression and viral incorporation, but they appeared to be somewhat defective in mediating viral entry (~40% of wt, Fig. 1 C and D) . In contrast, the remaining 33 substitutions did not greatly impair the ability of GP in mediating viral entry (more than 60% of wt). Indeed six of them (V96A, S119A, F151A, E156A, S167A, and T168A) displayed enhanced entry (over 200% of wt).\n\nAmong the 41 substitution mutants of GP characteri- Previously, we showed that four substitution mutants in this region (L43A, R54A, K56A, and E100A) displayed similar phenotypes, that is, they were expressed and incorporated onto virions like wt GP, but somewhat defective in mediating viral entry [24] . To further analyze the role of these residues in viral entry, fifteen double substitution mutants were generated.\n\nEach of these mutants was characterized in protein expression, viral incorporation, and in mediating viral entry. Five mutants (V79A/L43A, V79A/L51A, V79A/ R54A, V79A/E100A, and T60A/L51A) displayed defects either in protein expression or incorporation onto viral particles ( Fig. 2A) , thus. leading to the reduced ability of GP in mediating viral entry (Fig. 2B) . In contrast, the remaining 10 double substitution mutants did not display detectable defects in protein expression or viral incorporation, but they were impaired in mediating viral entry, ranging from 2% to 44% of wt GP (Fig. 2 \n\nWe have previously shown that expression of \u0394mucin Ebola GP in 293T cells by transient transfection can inhibit Ebola GP-mediated viral entry [25] . The choice of \u0394mucin Ebola GP instead of expressed as % wt. As expected, expression of wt or mutant Ebola GP proteins did not greatly affect VSV-G-mediated viral entry (Fig. 4B) . In contrast, entry of Ebola GP pseudovirions was decreased dramatically in cells expressing either \u0394mucin or GP mutants (Fig. 4B) (Fig. 4C) . Furthermore, the overall inhibitory profile of viral entry mediated by Marburg GP was highly similar to that by Ebola GP. Two mutants (R64A and K95A), which were impaired in inhibiting viral entry mediated by Ebola GP, were also less effective in inhibiting viral entry mediated by Marburg GP. These results substantiate the notion that Ebola and Marburg viruses share a common receptor/co-receptor for viral entry. These results further strengthen the argument that R64 and K95 are involved in direct interaction with the cellular receptor.\n\nTo further characterize the role of R64 and K95 in receptor binding, we performed a binding assay of the recombinant Ebola GP proteins following a published protocol [17] . We constructed and expressed the wt and mutant Ebola GP RBD-hIgG fusion constructs (Fig.   5A ). The purified proteins were used to bind the target cells (293T). As expected, the control protein S1-hIgG displayed little binding to 293T cells, as determined by flow cytometry (Fig. 5B ). In contrast, wt Ebola RBD-hIgG bound to the target cells (Fig. 5B) , in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown), consistent with the previous finding [17] . Mutant I170A bound to the target cells at a level similar to that of wt.\n\nHowever, mutants R64A and K95A bound to the target cells less efficiently compared to wt. These results provided direct evidence that R64 and K95 are involved in receptor binding. Since mutant I170A is similarly defective in mediating viral entry compared to R64A and K95A, but not defective in receptor binding, we conclude that I170 is involved in the post-binding steps during Ebola entry.\n\nIn this study, we focused on identification and analysis of critical residues of Ebola GP1 in receptor binding and post-binding steps. Previously we identified that residues 33 to 185 of the N-terminus consist of the receptor-binding domain, confirmed by others using a biochemical approach [17] . In this report, The role of Ebola GP residues in protein expression and viral entry was also studied by others. It has been shown that Y162A caused a defect in protein expression, virion incorporation, and entry [26] . Although it was generated on a \u0394Mucin GP (deletion of 315-504), the mutation displayed a similar phenotype to wt GP [24] . Consistent with our results, it has been shown that F88A rendered the infectious Ebola virus non-infectious [26] . Recently, another group studied Ebola GP function extensively using \u0394Mucin GP (deletion of aa 309-489) pseudotyped FIV viruses [3] . Ten mutations (T83A, S90A, V97A, N98A, T144A, E156A, F160A, T168A, V169A, and T174A) displayed similar phenotype to this work in virion incorporation and viral entry.\n\nStudy of Marburg GP-mediated viral entry showed similar results to our findings. K79, the conserved residue in Marburg GP corresponding to K95 of Ebola GP, has also been shown to be important for viral entry [25] . For the other receptor-binding residue (R64) and the putative receptor-binding residues of Ebola GP (L57, L63 and F88), the corresponding residues in Marburg GP are H48, L41, V47, and F72, respectively.\n\nAlanine substitution of these residues in Marburg GP caused defects in protein expression, and/or virion incorporation [25] . Therefore it is more difficult to distinguish their roles in protein folding, receptorbinding, or post-binding steps.\n\nAlthough a lot of host cell surface molecules have been implicated in Ebola entry, the receptor is not identified yet. Therefore we have used an entry interference assay to study the role of Ebola GP residues in receptor binding. Entry interference is one of the classical methods to determine whether different viruses use the same receptor. In infected cells, glycoprotein expressed by the virus can interact with its cognate receptor(s) to inhibit re-infection by the same virus or viruses using the same receptor.\n\nPreviously using entry interference, it was shown that expression of \u0394mucin Ebola GP blocked Ebola GP-mediated viral entry [25] . However the assay is less effective (with only 60% inhibition of viral entry) due to low efficiency and high variation of transient transfection. In this report, we improved the effectiveness (>90% inhibition of viral entry) and consistency using a retroviral vector to express GP protein in cells. It was shown that two alanine substitutions on \u0394mucin Ebola GP (R64A and K95A) were less efficient in inhibiting Ebola GP-mediated viral entry (31% and 18%) compared to wt (7%). This is consistent with the cell surface binding data. In were defective in inhibiting both Ebola and Marburg GP entry (Fig. 4 B and C) . Third, purified fusion proteins containing the Ebola RBD can block Marburg GP-mediated viral entry and vice versa [17] . In addition, small molecule compounds and their derivatives inhibited both Ebola and Marburg GP mediated viral entry while they displayed no effect on the VSV-G mediated entry [2, 51] . Taken together, these results strongly imply that the Marburg RBD adopts a similar structure as the Ebola RBD, and a common cellular factor is used by both Ebola and Marburg viruses for infection.\n\nThe results in this report and our previous study are summarized in Fig. 6 . Twelve residues (green) are important for viral entry. Among them, R64 and K95 are shown to be directly involved in receptor binding, while I170 plays a critical role in post-binding steps.\n\nThe roles of the remaining 9 residues in viral entry are not very clear at present, for example, they may be involved in either receptor-binding or the post-binding steps. Nevertheless, the results from the current study and the previous work by us and others, together with the x-ray structure of Ebola GP [18] , give insights to the structure and function of Ebola GP RBD."}
