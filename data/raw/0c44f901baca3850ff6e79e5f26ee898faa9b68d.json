{"title": "Emerging infections: a perpetual challenge", "body": "\"Not a single year passes without [which]\u2026we can tell the world: here is a new disease!\" Rudolf Virchow, 1867 1 Infectious diseases are responsible for 15 million (26%) of 57 million annual deaths in a global population of 6\u00b72 billion, 2 a proportion that could rise substantially as chronic diseases continue to be reclassified as infectious-eg, cervical cancer (human papillomavirus), Kaposi's sarcoma (human herpesvirus 8) , and Helicobacter pylori ulcers, among others.\n\nIn recent years, the terms \"emerging\" (ie, newly recognised) and \"re-emerging\" (previously recognised) infectious diseases have entered the vocabulary of medical science. 3-5 These infections also include \"deliberately emerging diseases\"-eg, bioterrorism. 5 Concern about emerging infections has grown following the appearance of new diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, and the re-emergence of others, such as dengue, and from appreciation of the complex determinants of their emergence-eg, microbial adaptation to new hosts (HIV infection, severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]), population immunity pressures (influenza A), travel (acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis), animal migration and movement (West Nile virus infection, H5N1 avian influenza), microbial escape from antibiotic pressures (multidrugresistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis), mechanical dispersal (Legionnaires' disease), and others (panel , figure 1 ). [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] The Plague of Athens, 430-426 BC \"The [pestilential disease] originated, so they say, in Ethiopia in upper Egypt, and spread from there into Egypt itself and Libya and much of the territory of the King of Persia. In the city of Athens it appeared suddenly\u2026As to the question of how it could first have come about or what causes can be found\u2026I must leave that to be considered by other[s]\u2026\" Thucydides, on the Plague of Athens 13\n\nThe above passage is taken from one of the most famous accounts of an emerging infection ever written: Thucydides' chronicle of the Plague of Athens, which heralded the end of the Golden Age of Greece (figure 2). 13, 28 The aetiology of this fatal, complex, multisystemic disease has not been conclusively identified; hypotheses include anthrax, smallpox, typhus, and more than 20 other infectious candidates. 28 Thucydides' vivid account nevertheless represents the first comprehensive clinical-epidemiological characterisation of an infectious disease and the first unambiguous description of an emerging infection. Noting universal susceptibility, multiple independent importations, and an association with war, crowding, and the breakdown of public-health measures, Thucydides also distinguished between signs, symptoms, complications, and variant clinical courses, and presented attack and case-fatality rates. His compelling clinical, public-health, and societally contextual description of an emerging disease was studied by virtually all western and middle eastern medical students for centuries, and profoundly influenced concepts of, approaches to, and even terminology of emerging infections well into the 19th century.\n\nThe Black Death, 1347-50 \"I think it may be said of the plague, as is said of the wind, that it bloweth where it listeth, and wee heare the sound thereof, but know not where it cometh nor where it goeth\u2026\" William Boghurst, circa 1665 29\n\nThe Black Death of the 14th century (bubonic/pneumonic plague, from the Latin plaga, a blow or stroke) killed approximately 34 million Europeans and 16 million Asians, placing it among the most fatal emerging infections in recorded history. 30 The disease's origin was traced to China in the 1330s or even earlier, from where it proceeded inexorably westward to Europe along caravan and shipping routes. 14,30 The many inter-related determinants of, and risk factors for its emergence (table) have been exhaustively documented and discussed (for example, in reference 26 ).\n\nAccounts of mass deaths, deserted towns, rotting corpses, and free-roaming farm animals are documented in countless texts, and survive today in many works of art (figure 2). The plague is said to have spawned the Tanzwuth (dancing mania) epidemics of the next two centuries, in which bands of itinerant youths roamed the countryside drinking, dancing frenetically, and tossing each other into the air. 31, 32 Multiple independent importations of the plague prompted public-health action in Europe and neighbouring areas. Frightened citizens began isolating arriving ships for as long as 40 (quaranta) days, the origin of quarantine. 14 In a Europe emerging from feudalism, government was now held accountable for public health. \"[E]veryone must reflect on and prevent the causes that can produce a universal or local pestilence [an epidemic or an outbreak]\", wrote Jacme d'Agramont in 1348. \"And if perchance these can be removed they must be removed. And to this end an effort should be made by the Lords [municipal officials] and their officers whose duty it is to look after the\u2026well-being of the community\". 33\n\nThe Black Death may also have been associated with one of the earliest recorded examples of bioterrorism. 24-26 In 1346 a Tartar army besieging the garrisoned Genovese city of Caffa (now Feodosiya, Ukraine) was devastated by plague. The Tartars reacted by catapulting \"mountains\" (probably thousands) of plague corpses into the city, 24,25 allegedly transmitting it to the besieged Genovese. 26 600 years later, during World War II, Japanese troops were less successful in starting a plague epidemic by dropping paper bags filled with infected fleas on Chinese cities. 34, 35 When (Old and New) Worlds collide: the French pox, 1494 \"\u2026nowadays we see maladies unknown to our forefathers springing up around us\".\n\nFrom the 15th through to the 19th century, a time when previously isolated continents were discovering each other and thereby exchanging microorganisms, re-emergence of epidemic diseases associated with geographic spread of microbes became common. In December, 1494, a new disease emerged in Italy; 15,36,37 prostitutes from Naples soon infected soldiers from an invading French army. By July the disease was being diagnosed in mercenaries from Flanders, Gascony (southwest France), Switzerland, Italy, Spain, and elsewhere; they eventually returned home and spread it throughout Europe.\n\nThe French pox (syphilis) shocked and terrified. 36 \"What other contagion has ever spread so quickly to all the countries of Europe, Asia, and Africa?\" asked Desiderius Erasmus (\"of Rotterdam\"); \"What other contagion takes such a hold of the entire body\u2026and tortures so cruelly\u2026 combin [ing] all that is dreadful in other contagions?\" 38\n\nSyphilis greatly influenced Fracastoro's theory of contagion, 39,40 the cornerstone of contagionism for the next 300 years. The epidemic also prompted substantial lay thought about disease emergence. Popular explanations (God's wrath, well poisoning, copulation with monkeys) seemed inadequate for a disease that was obviously acquired by intimate human contact and spread by human movement. In a nosological \"epidemic\" pre-dating the \"Spanish flu\" by four centuries, Portuguese, Dutch, and north Africans called syphilis \"the Castilian\" or \"the Spanish\" sickness. To Muscovites it became \"the Polish sickness\"; to the Poles \"the German sickness\"; to the Germans \"the French sickness\"; to the French \"the Neopolitan sickness\", and so on. Several years passed before a connection was made between the appearance of the French pox and the return of Christopher Columbus from the New World (March 31, 1493), but strong evidence for New World exportation was eventually provided by testimony from Columbus' men 41 and by physicians' accounts that Hispaniola natives had been affected by the disease since ancient times. 42\n\nSocietal responses to syphilis in the 15th and 16th centuries were not unlike responses to AIDS 500 years later. 43 Undeniable sexual transmission made syphilis one of the few diseases of that era, including leprosy, for which contact contagion was certain. Priests denounced the wickedness and immorality of an age that had provoked God's anger in the form of a deadly pandemic. Affected spouses, lovers, family, and friends were shunned and abandoned. The hospital bed linens of Parisian patients were initially burned. Soon, victims were turned away entirely; then they were given 24 h to isolate themselves or leave the city on pain of death by hanging. Charlatans with quack remedies, often painful and deadly, appeared everywhere to treat desperate and dying victims. Nothing worked. Syphilis and humanity therefore had to accommodate each other, and are still doing so 500 years later.\n\nMicrobial exchange and disease emergence in the age of discovery: Hueyzahuatl (smallpox), 1520 \"After our fathers and grandfathers succumbed\u2026dogs and vultures devoured the bodies. So it was that we became orphans, oh, my sons! So we became when we were young. All of us were thus. We were born to die!\" Cakchiquel Mayan on the hueyzahuatl epidemic of 1520- 21 44 The 1493 European importation of syphilis from the New World did not imply unidirectionality of biological conquests. Spanish adventurers under Hernando Cort\u00e9s landed on the Yucatan Coast 25 years later and marched to the capital of Tenochtitlan (now Mexico City), humiliating and imprisoning the Aztec ruler Moctezuma. Before Cort\u00e9s could defeat rival Spanish soldiers sailing from Cuba to restore Moctezuma's authority, the rival soldiers landed a former slave infected with smallpox. Over the next year the hueyzahautal (great eruption) raged over central America. [44] [45] [46] [47] Although smallpox may have first emerged in central Africa 5000 years previously-when an animal orthopoxvirus jumped into human beings 48 -the disease had probably not reached the New World. Historians believe that about 3\u00b75 million people in central Mexico died in the first year of the hueyzahautal. By the end of the century some 18\u00b75 (74%) of the 25 million population had died, 49 presumably largely because of smallpox and additional imported diseases. Smallpox spread southward into South America, ultimately destroying two great civilizations, the Aztec and Inca empires, facilitating Spanish conquests that greatly altered history. Francisco Pizarro, who continued Spanish conquests of South America in the 1530s, is alleged to have undertaken a bioterrorist attack on native peoples using smallpoxcontaminated blankets. 50 Mexico became a regional geographic reservoir for smallpox and was the source of repeated exportations until the 1940s.\n\n\"If there is, within medicine, any subject worthy of\u2026 investigation\u2026it is, without doubt, epidemic pestilential diseases, obscure and hidden in their causes, rapid in their progression, frightening in their symptoms, and deadly in their consequences.\"\n\nF\u00e9lix Vicq-d'Azyr, 1776 51\n\nThe emergence of devastating cattle epizootics in 18th century Europe had a profound impact on concepts of, and responses to, human disease emergence. 17 European epizootics of rinderpest, 51 a highly contagious bovine paramyxovirus disease, appeared in 1709, to be followed soon thereafter by epizootics of anthrax (1712) and foot and mouth disease (1755). 17,52 Between 1709 and 1769, more than 200 million western European cattle died of rinderpest alone, equivalent to 20% of all dairy cows. Rinderpest elicited relatively sophisticated germ theories 17 such that immunisation against it was considered 8 years before the first western immunisation was introduced in 1720 (smallpox inoculation). 52,53 Notably, rinderpest disease was understood clinically and epidemiologically by about 1770, more than a century before the causal agent was identified and characterised. 17\n\nThe epizootics of rinderpest, anthrax, and foot and mouth disease led to comparative animal study of disease transmission, to the establishment of the world's first veterinary schools, and to the first international human disease surveillance/outbreak investigation system. Thousands of bodies were placed three layers deep in mass graves, which sent a frightening stench over large parts of the city. Corpse wagons were so hastily and shoddily built that they spilled corpses, viscera, and putrid fluids into the streets. 19 When furniture vans had to be requisitioned to remove thousands of bodies, citizens were horrified to see layers of corpses piled upon them, claiming they heard cries and sobs coming from still-living victims. Rumours of mass poisoning of the water supply led vigilante mobs to roam the streets searching for suspected poisoners, attacking and sometimes killing innocent people.\n\nCase lists published in the daily newspapers allowed \"armchair epidemiologists\" to follow mortality and morbidity trends. For the first time in history, a large-scale emerging epidemic was scientifically investigated in \"real time\", using census data in a prospective populationbased approach that featured analyses of morbidity and mortality stratified by age-group, sex, occupation, socioeconomic status, and location, as well as calculation of case-fatality ratios, age-specific incidence rates, and attributable risks. 19 \"Modern\" epidemiology was born during the 1832 epidemic, but was unable to stop cholera emergence.\n\n\"\u2026The spirits flow away like running-water, au nanuma. The Fiji tragedy began innocently. On Jan 12, 1875, HMS Dido sailed into Fiji with its former king and queen, two of their sons, and a retinue of about 100 Fijians. As a sign of good will, Queen Victoria had sent them all on a post-cession sightseeing visit to Australia. 13 days into the 19-day return voyage, one of the sons developed fever and rash. The ship surgeon diagnosed measles, then prevalent in Sydney, but as yet unknown in Fiji.\n\nHMS Dido's yellow quarantine flag was not flying when it sailed into the Fijian port. Arriving British dignitaries compounded the mistake by focusing on a seemingly more pressing problem: while in Sydney a just-married (now measles-infected) son of the king had acquired \"a drip\" (gonorrhoea) that had to be kept from newspaper reporters. During the ensuing discussions on board, no one seems to have considered the problem of 100 Fijians potentially incubating measles. Nor did anyone notice that boats were bringing impatient passengers to shore, or that most of Fiji's police force had sailed out to celebrate on the ship.\n\nWorse yet, the mountain cannibal chiefs had been threatening to revolt against cession and, while the king was away, his brother, Ratu Savanaca Naulivou, had arranged a national meeting, unprecedented in size, at which the chiefs might be persuaded to join the government. On Jan 25, 13 days (about one measles incubation period) after HMS Dido's return, the meeting was attended by 69 chiefs, 800 family and guests, and the 143-man police force, many already developing fevers and rashes. 20\n\nThe attendees returned to their homes throughout Fiji, seeding a widespread and deadly measles epidemic that killed a third of Fiji's population, an estimated 40 000 people, 20 and was exported to other Pacific islands in a regional pandemic. To reduce fever, terrified Fijians lay down in the ocean and in streams and wrapped small children in wet grass. Trying to stop epidemic spread, those who were unafflicted burned the villages of ill, with friends and family still trapped inside their dwellings. Corpses lay everywhere in the open, scavenged by dogs and wild pigs. The stench of destroyed villages was notable a mile away. Ratu Savanaca succumbed and his body was thrown into a communal pit. The mountain chiefs revolted, killing and sometimes eating British subjects. They were defeated by British forces in The Little War, and their leaders were hung. 20 years later, when Queen Victoria commissioned a study of Fiji's population decrease, the emerging measles epidemic was barely mentioned; 73 thus Fijian \"racial degeneracy\" remained the eugenics-inspired explanation for the decrease. The cautionary tale of Fiji's quintessential virgin soil epidemic remained in textbooks for another century, but the determinants of its emergence were largely ignored.\n\n\"It is quite probable that influenza will continue to be prevalent\u2026all over the world for some years to come\u2026 May we hope that etiological and epidemiological work\u2026 will furnish us with more competent methods for prevention and delimation before the world is visited by another pandemic.\"\n\nHans Zinsser, 1922 74\n\nThe 1918 influenza pandemic, arguably the deadliest emerging pandemic to date, is believed to have killed 50-100 million people within the first 2 years of its appearance ( figure 2) . 75, 76 The pandemic defied many of the expectations surrounding influenza, appearing in three waves within a 9-12-month period, providing conflicting evidence with regard to wave-towave protective immunity, and causing a higher than expected death rate across a wide agerange. The pandemic was also notable for a predominance of severe and fatal disease in healthy young adults. 77-79 The 1918 influenza pandemic was one of the first infectious disease outbreaks in which microbial co-infections were appreciated and studied scientifically, 80 a phenomenon important to understanding AIDS seven decades later.\n\nThe pandemic's unresolved mysteries have haunted successive generations, 78 providing a lesson about the unpredictability of emerging infections. More recently, it has served as a benchmark for pandemic \"worst-case scenario\" planning. 81 While work on the potential for emerging influenza pandemics continues, other worrisome diseases continue to emerge-eg, SARS, appearing in 2003 and caused by a virus genetically unrelated to influenza that nonetheless mimics it in its means of spread and its threat to public-health control. Since at least the time of Thucydides, one of the first human responses to disease emergence has been to question its origin. When identified in 1981, AIDS seemed to be a completely new disease. Its early recognition in a peripatetic airline steward suggested (only partly correctly) that its emergence might have resulted from increased human movement resulting from ever decreasing travel times to multiple destinations. 84 Moreover, rapid spread via blood and body fluids within risk groups most capable of supporting such transmission (men who have sex with men, injection drug users, and transfusion recipients) seemed to support recent emergence. Surprisingly, however, phylogenetic analyses of the virus suggest that HIV infection emerged as a human disease around 1900, 85 and by complex pathways. Multiple jumps, into chimpanzees, of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) strains restricted to different primate species, 86 were apparently followed by SIV genetic recombinations that produced new chimpanzee-adapted SIVs. It is likely that three of these recombinants then transferred independently into human beings, leading to parallel HIV emergences now represented by different HIV clades. 85\n\nAbout 1% of Europeans are resistant to HIV because of a homozygous 32 bp deletion in the gene encoding for the major co-receptor for HIV, the human CCR5 cell-surface molecule. This protective allele seems to have appeared in the distant past and to have been positively selected for over many centuries. Geneticists and demographers generally agree that the driving force behind this allele's frequency was probably an infectious disease, although historical, mathematical, and archeological evidence is incomplete for the two chief contenders, smallpox and plague. 87\n\nEmerging infections have for millennia threatened the survival of human societies who share ecosystems with rapidly evolving microbial organisms and their non-human hosts, vectors, and reservoirs. Man's struggle against emerging infections has been a fundamental determinant of the existence and evolution of the human species. The possibility that individual and population resistance to emerging pandemic diseases results from gene selection by previous emerging diseases underscores the complex nature of the human-microbial interaction. 87\n\nThe ten historical emerging epidemics/epizootics examined here were selected nonsystematically from among many newly emerging and re-emerging diseases recorded over several millennia. We attempted to provide examples that were not only well documented but also reflective of the range and complexity of individual and interacting risk determinants.\n\nAlthough these examples cannot be considered representative of all of the many hundreds of historically documented emerging diseases, inclusion of those widely considered among the most important, such as the Black Death, Spanish influenza, and AIDS, serves to highlight determinants relevant at least to emerging diseases with pronounced impact on human beings.\n\nComparison of historical determinants of emergence and those associated with modern emerging diseases suggests that they are largely the same. 5 Prominent among these are determinants reflecting human mobility such as demographics/behaviour and trade/commerce, host susceptibility factors, and poverty/social inequality (panel and table) . 5 For example, although separated by millennia, the spread along trade routes of newly emerging diseases in ancient Greece (the Plague of Athens), in medieval Europe (the Black Death), and across the African continent (AIDS), are similar in their dependence on human modes and patterns of movement. Other less universal determinants of historical emergence have nonetheless appeared repeatedly in association with varying other cofactors-eg, the role of technology and industry in the re-emergence of diseases such as dengue and chikungunya, spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which oviposits preferentially in modern products such as discarded tyres and tin cans.\n\nIf there is anything new in disease emergence today, it seems to be less in the nature of specific determinants of emergence than in the greater complexity of modern existence, which in turn leads to increased opportunities for convergence of interactive risk determinants and greater speeds with which emergence can occur and escape control measures. As long ago as 1918, in the era before commercial air travel, the second wave of the influenza pandemic appeared in different regions of the world almost simultaneously. In 2008, air travel can bring a new disease from any major city to any other in a day (figure 3), while complex trade and distribution systems can spread even a non-contagious infectious disease quickly beyond the reach of local public-health containment, as exemplified by a US national ice cream-associated epidemic of salmonella in 1994 88 and a spinach-associated epidemic of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in 2006. 89 Moreover, recent recognition of the role of weather/climate, climate cycles (eg, the El Ni\u00f1o southern oscillation), and global warming in the emergence of diseases such as dengue and malaria suggests that risk determinant complexities and interactions may increase. 6\n\nAlthough this article has emphasised emerging pandemic diseases, emerging diseases with more limited (non-pandemic) spread, such as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and Lyme disease, have also presented substantial public-health challenges. In other cases, disease emergence may occur so insidiously that recognition is difficult (eg, tuberculosis during the Renaissance [14-17th centuries]). In recent times we have seen an extraordinary growth in reemergence of infectious diseases, a phenomenon that apparently began in the Age of Discovery (15-18th centuries), when microbes came into contact with new human populations, and which is still accelerating as population growth and travel provide better avenues of escape for microbes entrenched in complex localised ecosystems (eg, geographic extension of arboviral diseases such as dengue, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile virus, and chikungunya infections).\n\nWell-understood determinants of modern disease emergence, typically acting in concert, have been associated throughout recorded history with the emergence of major diseases. These determinants have been similar in their explosiveness, impact, and elicitation of public-health control responses. Whether the nature and pattern of these determinants are changing or will change in the future remains speculative. That most of the historical emerging diseases we examined were associated with unique patterns of common determinants suggests to us that an increasingly complex modern world will probably provide increasing opportunities for disease emergence. For centuries a fundamental challenge to the existence and well-being of societies-as reflected by scientific attention, as well as in art, religion, and culture-emerging infections remain among the principal challenges to human survival. As travel times between distant places have decreased markedly in the past nine decades, the potential for human importation of diseases, especially those with long incubation periodseven if they are easily identifiable-is greatly increased, thereby increasing the potential for re-emergence of epidemic diseases via spread into new geographic areas.
