{"title": "IMMUNITY AND IMMUNOPATHOLOGY TO VIRUSES: what decides the outcome?", "body": "Almost all virus infections cause the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells types, particularly macrophages, and in some infections neutrophils, that in turn release a range of molecules that induce tissue damage or malfunction. These include cytotoxic cytokines, cationic proteins, lipid mediators, metalloproteinases and components of the oxygen burst. The reactive oxygen species that accumulate in the mitochondria may further contributes to tissue damage 3 . Both innate and adaptive immune signaling events are involved in mediating tissue damage.\n\nInvading viruses and their replicative intermediates can be recognized by several innate immune receptors expressed either at the surface or within cells. Many types of innate immune receptor can participate in the immune response, but in virus infections, the most studied are the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and NODlike receptors (NLRs). Virus infections usually activate the endosomal TLRs; TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9, that recognize viral nucleic acids and double-stranded RNA intermediates 4 . The cytoplasmic RIG-I-like receptors recognize viral genomic RNA or RNA encoded by genomic DNA, whereas the NLRs recognize the virus DNA genome (reviewed in 5 ). In general, activation of many of these receptors causes the production of proinflammatory cytokines and interferons (IFNs), as well as signals that recruit and activate cells involved in inflammation and the induction of adaptive immunity. The pattern of innate immune events induced after the entry of virus may dictate the outcome of infection. Many viruses that persist signal innate cells such as dendritic cells NK cells and macrophages to produce anti-inflammatory molecules such as IL-10 and TGF\u03b2. For example, dendritic cells from LCMV infected mice produce abundant IL-10 6 and IL-10 is produced by monocytes from HIV, HCV and HBV infected individuals [7] [8] [9] . Upon RSV infection the interaction made with lung plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) is critical since pDC removal before infection favors an immunopathological reaction in the lungs 10 . A damaging response to a virus infection is more likely to occur with viruses that can interfere with one or more innate defences. Some examples and the innate defence mechanism that is blunted are listed in table 1.\n\nOnce adaptive immune effectors are produced, these can contribute to tissue damage. T cells for example, can directly destroy virus-infected cells or release cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) that damages cells. With some non-cytopathic virus infections, such as HCV and HBV, destruction of infected cells by CD8 + T effectors is the main cause of damage to the liver 11, 12 (Box 1 and Fig 1) . Responses to infected cells by different types of CD4 + T cells orchestrate a tissue-damaging inflammatory reaction and these become chronic against persistent viruses. Most often the cell subsets involved are T helper 1 (Th1) cells, but Th17 cells may contribute to inflammatory reactions with HIV, HCV and influenza virus infections [13] [14] [15] . In such reactions neutrophils are recruited and become a major source of tissue-damaging molecules. With viruses Th2 cells are rarely associated with inflammatory reactions but this like happens with severe lung reactions to RSV 16 Box 1\n\nSeveral human viral infections, for example HIV, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus (HCV), become persistent and some can cause severe chronic disease that is usually the consequence of an immune reaction to the infections. Many herpes viruses persist but rarely cause chronic disease in normal hosts. In HIV infection, the virus is never removed from the body, as it integrates into the genome of infected host cells and as multiple immune evasive properties. These include antigenic variability, the structure of its envelope, which makes it refractory to neutralizing effect of antibodies, replication in and destruction of CD4 + T cells, induction of immune imbalance and induced expression of negative regulatory receptors on CD8 + T cells which makes them functionally ineffective.\n\nHCV infection causes chronic lesions in ~85% of infected individuals, but the remaining 15% control the infection and clear virus from the liver. HCV is a non-cytolytic infection that replicates for several weeks before an adaptive immune response occurs. Viral clearance is mediated by T cells and this causes hepatocyte destruction and mild hepatitis. The virus has several means of inhibiting innate immune mechanisms and the impact of these may relate to whether viral control or chronicity ultimately occurs. The innate immune attenuators encoded by the virus include inhibiting type I interferon (IFN) responses at several levels, raising the activation threshold of natural killer (NK) cell activation and having negative effects on dendritic cell maturation and function. Protective immunity is associated with the induction of IFN\u03b3-producing CD8 + T cells and high numbers of T helper 1 cells. Individuals that develop chronic disease instead mount a response comprising interleukin-10 (IL-10)-producing CD8 + and CD4 + T cells and sometimes FOXP3 + regulatory T cells. However, it is not clear what accounts for the different outcome of HCV infection. It has been suggested that dose of exposure, polymorphism of genes affecting NK cell activation and concurrent disease or infections (for example, co-infection with HIV and HCV results in more severe hepatitis). The role of innate and adaptive events that affect HCV pathogenesis recently received an excellent review 12 .\n\nAntibody responses to viruses may also contribute to tissue damage. This occurs when antibody reacts with an infected cell, activates complement and causes an inflammatory reaction. Alternatively, antibody mediated inflammatory reactions involve toxicity mediated by IgG engaging Fc receptors on inflammatory cells causing mediator release 17 , or are the consequence of viral antigen antibody complexes being trapped in capillary beds and activating the complement cascade. Immune complex lesions can occur when viruses persist and poorly neutralizing IgG is produced. Lesions include nephritis, polyarteritis and arthritis. Immune complex lesions were first reported for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) but have also been reported in chronic HCV and HBV as well as in idiotypic IgA nephropathy associated with HIV infection [18] [19] [20] [21] . Viruses such as RSV express antigens that may induce an IgE response and type I hypersensitivity might partially account for lung lesions in some children infected with RSV 22 .\n\nIn spite of all the above-mentioned events that can elicit tissue damage, tissue damage is modest in most cases but can be quite variable between individuals infected with the same virus. There are several responses the host can make to minimize tissue damage. These are now mentioned.\n\nThe host can use many counter-measures to limit tissue damage after virus infection. These tissue protective events are more effective against some viruses and some circumstances of infection than others, accounting for the different pattern of response observed among individuals. The countermeasures include the production of cytokines such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) that have anti-inflammatory activity, other host derived anti-inflammatory mediators such as resolvins and galectins, the activity of cell subsets that inhibit other cells from mediating inflammatory events, as well as the induction of molecules on effector cells that result in the loss of effector functions. These counterinflammatory factors are discussed and are depicted in Figure 2 .\n\nThe two best-known cytokines that inhibit inflammatory reactions are IL-10 and TGF\u03b2. Many cell types can produce IL-10. These include subsets of activated DCs, macrophages when infected with some viruses, activated regulatory T (TReg) cells, B cells and some subsets of natural killer (NK) cells following stimulation with TLR ligands 23 . Although, some viruses such as EBV and cytomegalovirus (CMV) produce an IL-10-like molecule that functions in vitro like host IL-10 it is still not clear if this viral IL-10 plays any role during viral infections in vivo 24, 25 . Host derived IL-10 can act to block pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production, MHC class II expression and can also interfere with signaling of many pathways that result in pro-inflammatory cytokine production. For example, nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) signalling is inhibited by IL-10 mediated induction of p50 and p105 units one of which (p50) binds to the stimulatory subunit p65, sequestering it in the cytoplasm and making it unavailable for binding to the IL-6 and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 (MIP1 ) promoters for their transcription (reviewed in 26 ). IL-10 also suppresses type I interferon-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and also induces the expression of suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3) by macrophages and neutrophils, which impairs their inflammatory activity.\n\nThe extent of IL-10 induction during an infection could influence the amount of tissue damage that occurs. Thus, if the IL-10 response is lacking, owing to genetic mutation, or is artificially suppressed by antibodies to IL-10 or its receptor, inflammatory reactions to infectious agents may be exaggerated. For example mice lacking an IL-10 response develop more severe inflammatory reactions to ocular infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV) than do normal controls 27 . IL-10 may be of particular importance to constrain the severity of inflammatory reactions caused by chronic infections and its anti-inflammatory value has been advocated with viruses such as HCV and HIV 9, 28, 29 .\n\nRecently, IL-10 production by virus-specific effector T cells during the acute response to influenza virus was shown responsible for minimizing the severity of pulmonary lesions in mice 30 . The responding CD8 + cells showed plasticity and gained the ability to produce IL-10 in addition to their main effector product, IFN\u03b3. Inhibiting the response to IL-10 with antibody specific for the IL-10 receptor resulted in more severe and sometimes fatal virusinduced lung damage. IL-10 production by effector CD8 + T cells and its suppression of IL-2 production by these cells was also demonstrated in HIV-infected patients 31 . Suppression of the effector T cell IL-10 response by lethal strains of influenza virus, such as the 1918 H1N1 strain and the H5N1 strains, is thought to contribute to their virulence 32 . In some instances excessive IL-10 production during a virus infection may inhibit protective effector T cells response and favour viral persistence 6 . This can happen in some circumstances with LCMV infection and may also be happening during HIV infection 6, 9 . The TGF\u03b2 superfamily of cytokines has a similar counter-inflammatory role to IL-10, although the effects of TGF\u03b2 are more complex. These cytokines have a wide range of activities that include both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory effects with the outcome depending on the concentration of TGF\u03b2 available and some other factors 33 . Moreover, TGF\u03b2 superfamily members exist in a latent inactive form and must be cleaved before they can bind to receptors and mediate their effects on cells. Nevertheless, the extent of TGF\u03b2 production during virus infection could influence whether or not the response becomes overtly tissue damaging. Accordingly, TGF\u03b2 inhibits several functions of T cells that include proliferation, differentiation into effector T cells and inhibition of some effector functions such as cytotoxicity 34 . The inflammatory activities of CD8 + T cells, Th1 cells and Th17 cells, as well the production of inflammatory products by recruited cells, are all inhibited by TGF\u03b2 34 .\n\nMost of our knowledge on the role of TGF\u03b2 in microbial pathogenesis concerns non-viral pathogens 35, 36 . However, some viruses do cause an increase in TGF\u03b2 levels and other viruses express proteins that can cleave and activate TGF\u03b2. For example, influenza virus neuraminidase can activate TGF\u03b2 and the extent to which this happens could influence virulence 37 . Among the viruses that cause increased TGF\u03b2 production are chronic infections by HBV and HCV. A nonstructural protein of HCV (NS4) was shown responsible for TGF\u03b2 induction and it seems that the magnitude of the TGF\u03b2 response, along with IL-10 production, could determine if HCV infection is effectively cleared or becomes chronic 14 . Acute infection with reovirus may also activate TGF\u03b2 signalling to an extent that correlates with damage to the central nervous system 38 . Of note, virus-specific CD8 T cells isolated from HCV infected individuals produce TGF\u03b2 that suppresses virus specific T cell responses 39 . Moreover, blockade of TGF\u03b2 enhanced the in vitro activity of T cells 39 . Furthermore, a recent report attributed an intrinsic role of TGF\u03b2 signaling in effector T cells to explain their diminished survival and effector functions during chronic LCMV infection 40 .\n\nIL-10 and TGF\u03b2 are not the only cytokines that can limit damage caused by inflammatory reactions. Recently for example, IL-17, a cytokine that is normally associated with the promotion of tissue damage was shown to have an anti-inflammatory role by suppressing Th1-mediated inflammatory effects 41 . The suppressive effect of IL-17 was noted initially with autoimmune lesions but was recently also observed in Theilers virus encephalitis in mice 42 .\n\nSeveral other natural host products can also participate in the control and resolution of inflammatory reactions ( Figure 3 ). These include the galectins, resolvins and protectins. These molecules contribute to the resolution of inflammatory lesions in several noninfection related lesions 43 . Members of the galectin family might also help to constrain inflammatory reactions 43 . Galectin-9, for example, binds to the T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain protein 3 (TIM-3) on activated effector cells and causes apoptosis, but at the same time expands the TReg response [44] [45] [46] . Both effects minimize tissue damage. Conceivably, variations in galectin concentrations between individuals could explain why the outcome in some is rapid and protective but in others prolonged and tissue damaging. Currently there is no support for this ideas, but galectin levels are different between HIV and HCV infected person and controls and with HCV galectin levels may correlate with viral loads 47, 48 .\n\nAnother mechanism of counteracting excessive tissue damage following virus infection is the induction, activation or expansion of several types of TReg cell whose main activity is to inhibit the function of other cell types. The best studied TReg cells are CD4 + T cells that express the transcription factor forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) 49 . Such TReg cells could influence the outcome of infection particularly those that are chronic in nature 50 . In model systems where the activity of TReg cells can be inhibited, tissue-damaging immunopathological reactions to some viruses are increased. This was observed with the blinding corneal response to HSV in mice 51 . Similar useful effects of TReg cells were noted in a Friend retrovirus model as well as with mouse models of RSV and West Nile virus 52, 53 . In the HSV ocular immunopathology model, recent observations showed the therapeutic value of increasing the proportion of FOXP3 + TReg cells to manage viral immunopathological reactions 54, 55 . This was achieved by administering reagents, such as galectin-9 and the fungal metabolite FTY720, that could cause some conventional CD4 + T cells to convert in vivo to become FOXP3 + and regulatory in function 45, 55 . In several chronic human virus infections, TReg cells are advocated to influence the extent of tissue damage, but this view remains debatable and is difficult to evaluate in natural disease situations 56 . Some of the best evidence that TReg cells are beneficial in a human chronic viral infection came from observations on the disease outcome in patients accidentally infected with HCV. Here it was shown that a favourable outcome was more likely to occur in those individuals that made the highest IL-10-producing TReg cell responses 57 .\n\nAn additional mechanism that could affect the pattern of events that follow virus infection is the signalling of inhibitory receptors on effector cells of both innate and adaptive immune systems. Such events may favour tissue damage over infection control. Several negative signalling systems that affect innate immune responses to virus infections have been noted. Many of these act by terminating NF-kB signalling which curtails pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production 58 . A more detailed description is included in box 2.\n\nInnate immune cells after recognizing PAMPs via their innate receptors such as TLRs, RLRs and NLRs become activated and produce abundant of inflammatory cytokines that include, type IFNs, TNF and IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and some chemokines. Some of these molecules recruit other inflammatory cells such as neutrophils, which promote tissue damage. However, the host has evolved mechanisms to counter-regulate some or all of these pathways. Some of the noted molecules and pathways include A20 deubiquitinase, IRAK-M, Tollips, SOCS proteins and myeloid cell-associated immunoglobulin-like receptors (MAIRs) also known as CD300 and TAM receptors. Some of these negative signalling systems affect innate immune responses to virus infections. Examples include the deubiquitinase A20 that terminates NF-kB signalling and IRAK-M that interferes with TLR and IL-1 signaling 58 . SOCS proteins interfere with cytokine signalling and are induced as a result of IL-10 receptor and TAM receptor signalling in macrophages and granulocytes. However some viruses use such pathways for their entry and enhanced tissue tropism. For example viruses such as Filoviruses (Ebola and Marburgvirus) exploit TAM receptors. After infection with filoviruses, innate cells secrete abundant of proinflammatory cytokines such as type I IFNs. Additionally however, SOCS proteins are also induced as a result of TAM signalling 140 . Therefore, it could be that while the use of these receptors by some viruses promotes infection and cause damage to the host, the subsequent signalling events induced might also moderate immune-mediated tissue damage. However, this scenario needs to be formally investigated in virus-induced pathogenesis.\n\nThe protective function of effector T cells may also be compromised if they express inhibitory receptors and engage their ligands. The circumstances that result in upregulation of inhibitory receptors by effector T cells is not fully understood at a mechanistic level, but the effect usually becomes evident during chronic infections, especially those that involve high levels of persistent antigen 59 . Some of the well characterized receptors that can be induced in chronic infection include programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and IL-10R. These molecules are expressed at higher levels on CD8 + T cells during chronic infection with LCMV infection in mice 60, 6 . Their engagement with the respective ligands impair effector T cell function giving a so-called exhaustion phenotype. This exhaustion phenotype has since been observed in other chronic infections that include HIV, HCV and HBV [61] [62] [63] . Some recent studies have suggested the existence of cross talk between the PD-1/PDL-1 pathway and the production of IL-10. Thus, triggering the PD-1 receptor by its ligand (PDL-1) induced high levels of IL-10 production in monocytes that in turn inhibited the function of CD4 T cells 64 . The IL-10 mediated inhibition of CD4 T cells effector function was also demonstrated in chronic LCMV infection in mice 6 . Exhausted T cells may express additional inhibitory receptors that include lymphycyte activation gene (LAG) 3, TIM3 and perhaps others, with distribution varying in different locations 59 . Binding of inhibitory receptors on exhausted T cells diminishes their protective function, allowing viruses to persist and cause more tissue damage. In fact, the TNF-producing ability of exhausted T cells that contributes to tissue damage is one of the last functions to wane 59 . It is not clear how infection causes inhibitory receptor upregulation but in some instances a viral component has been implicated (for example, the HCV core protein) and in others viralinduced interferons 63, 65 or TLR ligands expressed by viruses are thought to have a role 66 .\n\nAn important outcome of recognizing the exhaustion phenomenon is that an opportunity arises for a novel effective means of improving immunity and controlling the severity of chronic viral infections. Accordingly, blocking the signals responsible for the exhaustion state can result in partial recovery of immune function and more effective infection control 60, 6 . Initial observations focused on blockade of PD1 or PDL-1 as well as IL-10R using monoclonal antibodies but blocking multiple inhibitory signals was even more efficacious than only single blockade 67, 68 . Thus, blocking either PD-1/PD-L1 and IL-10R or PD-1/PDL-1 and LAG-3 receptors provided the best approach to achieve immune recovery and viral control after chronic LCMV infection in mice. Furthermore, combining exhaustion blockade with therapeutic vaccination was a superior means of controlling chronic LCMV infection than either approach alone 69, 70 . One anticipates similar strategies might prove useful to control human chronic infections.\n\nThe aim of this review is to explain the variable outcome of a virus infection between different individuals infected with the same virus. This challenge is particularly difficult to meet with sporadic diseases that cause overt disease in only a very small minority of infected persons. The classic example is paralytic polio that affected <1% of those infected with poliovirus 71 . Reasons for susceptibility to the disease remain unexplained but one favoured idea was that CNS involvement reflected a defect in type I IFN induction, allowing robust poliovirus replication in the periphery and spread to the CNS 71 . Another example is herpes encephalitis that occurs in adults. This is a rare, often lethal, debilitating disease caused by HSV type 1 72 . The disease usually occurs following reactivation of the host's resident latent virus, although primary infection can occasionally result in encephalitis and is a common outcome in seronegative neonates infected with HSV type 2. Lesions of herpes encephalitis in adults are in part immunopathological, but why they only occur in an unfortunate few is not known. Primary genetic susceptibility factors have not been implicated nor has the emergence of a neurotropic mutant, although recently a minority of cases of herpes encephalitis in children were associated with polymorphism of TLR3 or the UNC93B genes involved in TLR signaling 73, 74 . The section that follows deals with situations that favour a tissue-damaging response over immune control. Specific examples are listed in table 1.\n\nWhether a virus causes severe tissue damage often depends on the age at which infection occurs. For example, intrauterine infections may result in severe tissue damage as happens with rubella and CMV infections in humans 75 . In general, it is the young and the elderly who suffer the most severe consequences of infection, as illustrated by increased morbidity and mortality among these age groups following infection with seasonal influenza virus 76 . Increased susceptibility of the young, especially neonates, has been attributed to immature responsiveness of the immune system, particularly components of innate immunity. For example, RSV is the first pathogen a human infant usually encounters and clinical signs of RSV infection are common by 2-3 months of age 77 . Premature infants are particularly prone to develop severe lesions in the respiratory tract following RSV infection and these account for many of the 3-5% of childhood RSV infections that require hospitalization 77, 78 . This high susceptibility of infants is mainly explained by an inadequate type I IFN response together with a failure to activate subsets of DCs that induce CD8 + T cell-and Th1 cellmediated protective responses 79 . Instead, the DCs that are stimulated tend to produce IL-10 and TGF\u03b2 and to act as inducers of FOXP3 + Treg cells 80 . Studies of RSV infection using animal model systems indicate that the main mediators of the lung pathology are T cells but there is still debate as to which subsets are mainly involved. Some indicate a pathological role for TNF producing CD8 + T cells and others advocate that lesions are associated with Th2 cell-dominated responses 16 . The debate has been recently reviewed 78 . Since childhood infection with RSV is a significant health problem against which there is no effective vaccine, understanding at a mechanistic level why some individuals develop severe lesions to RSV becomes a critical issue.\n\nAged individuals may also suffer more problems than younger individuals following primary or secondary infection with some viruses. For example, re-exposure of aged individuals to RSV can cause lesions similar to those that occur in infants 81 . In addition, aged individuals may develop lesions following reactivation of latent infections that had been successfully controlled by their immune system for decades. The best example of this is shingles, which is characterized by painful inflammatory skin lesions that occur at sites innervated by a sensory ganglion in which varicella zoster virus has been reactivated from latency 82 . Why this happens in only a few of the many ganglia that contain latent virus is unknown. It is possible that reactivation of latent virus occurs often but is successfully controlled by T cell immunity 83 . Presumably this T cell activity can fail at some sites but not others; further study is required to understand how this happens.\n\nUnderstanding senescence of the immune system is an active area of research and the topic has been covered in excellent reviews 84, 85 . Studies, mainly done in mice, have revealed that ageing has a greater effect on primary than on memory immune responses 84 . The T and B cells from aged individuals respond less well to antigens and are compromised in their ability to perform effector functions as compared to responses in young individuals. Moreover, naive T cells from aged compared with young animals undergo less homeostatic proliferation probably because of competition with memory T cells for growth factors and anatomical space 84 . An additional effect observed during senescence is that the breath of the T cell repertoire is reduced perhaps because the thymus has involuted 84 . Indeed, compared with young individuals, aged individuals often have increased numbers of CD8 + T cells that recognize latent viral infections, particularly cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections -an effect known as memory inflation 86 ; these CMV-specific CD8 + T cells can account for 50% or more of the total CD8 + memory T cell population. The space such cells occupy could diminish the number of lymphocytes available to react to pathogens perhaps explaining why infections such as influenza virus are more severe in the elderly.\n\nAs can readily be shown in experimental systems, the dose and route of virus transmitted can markedly influence the outcome of a virus infection. Minimal doses may be controlled subclinically by innate defences and may be insufficient to induce adaptive immune responses. Massive doses can overwhelm immune defences and cause severe disease and rapid death, in some instances by direct cytotoxic effects of viral components. Doses in between these extremes can have a variable outcome from inapparent infection to tissuedamaging lesions. This issue has received surprisingly little formal study with virus infections, but it is a common practice for those who study viral pathogenesis to choose optimal doses of infection to evaluate their concepts. Dose and route of infection is expected to influence how successful the virus will be to gain access to susceptible target cell as well as to be transported by different types of DCs to lymphoid tissues. Thus, it is clear from studies with protein antigens that the magnitude and quality of immune responses induced is influenced by the type of DCs that engage antigen 87 . With replicating agents such as viruses, dose effects might depend on the type of virus, rates of replication and intrinsic properties such as expression of ligands for innate immune receptors. For lentiviruses, for example, the dose seems to have little effect perhaps because potent infection is usually established by a single (founder) virion from the large numbers of virions (up to 10 6 ) that are transmitted to the host 88 . Experimental studies of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of macaques also show little or no effect of dose on the outcome of infection 89 . By contrast, for cytopathic viruses, the dose of infection can influence the response pattern 90 . Curiously for influenza virus, the dose of infection of mice also affects the range of cells that become infected, as well as the balance of the immune response that results 91 . At high doses, DCs and alveolar epithelial cells become infected. Moreover, the infected DCs deliver apoptotic signals to the CD8 + T cells that normally have the principal role in resolving infection. At lower doses, DC infection does not occur and the protective CD8 + T cell response is not compromised.\n\nRecently, an interesting and unexpected effect of infection dose was noted in chimpanzees infected with HBV 92 . HBV is a non-cytopathic virus and both control of the virus and the development of immunopathological hepatic lesions are mediated by CD8 + T cells. Over a wide dose range (10 4 -10 8 virions), the outcome of infection was similar, being controlled successfully 6-8 weeks after infection with minimal hepatitis. However, after administering a large dose (>10 8 ) of virus, 100% of hepatocytes became infected, virus reached high levels for at least 16 weeks and animals developed chronic active hepatitis. Unexpectedly, animals infected with a very low dose (100 or less) had a comparable immunopathological outcome to those infected with a large dose. Reasons for this are still uncertain but it is possible that at low doses, the virus can go undetected by the immune system and fail to induce priming of CD4 + T cells, which are needed to provide 'help' to mount a protective CD8 + T cell response. Furthermore, if animals were depleted of CD4 + T cells and given the medium dose of virus they developed chronic active hepatitis. How these observations relate to HBV infection of humans needs evaluation.\n\nDose of infection could be the explanation for the variable outcome of infection by insect transmitted flaviviruses. Thus, West Nile virus is becoming a common infection in the western hemisphere but most infected persons suffer no clinical consequences. However occasional individuals suffer a life threatening meningoencephalitis. In such individuals virus crosses the blood-brain barrier and lesions are then the consequence of a viral antigenspecific T cell-mediated immunopathological reaction to infected cells 93 . One idea to explain the pathological outcome is that it occurs in circumstances in which the virus replicates rapidly and exceeds the host's ability to constrain it despite the induction of an neutralizing antibody response and numbers of functional T cells that would otherwise be protective 93 . This scenario is more likely to occur in those exposed to many mosquito bites (providing a high dose infection), especially if the infected person is young, aged or has some degree of immunodeficiency. Curiously, some flaviviruses, for example West Nile virus, stimulate TLR3 (which recognizes double-stranded DNA) and induces TNF production, and this may increase the permeability of the blood-brain barrier and allow entry of the virus to the CNS 94 .\n\nThe route of infection can also impact on the extent of tissue damage that ensues. For example, with HSV infection of humans, oral or genital infection usually results in lesions that resolve without long-term damage. However, infection of the eye can result in blinding chronic immunoinflammatory lesions 95 . Similarly, mice infected with corona virus or Theilers virus can develop immunopathological lesions in the CNS, but this response only occurs if virus is given intracerebrally or intranasally and fails to occur after systemic infection 96, 97 . The meningitis that adult mice develop after LCMV infection only occurs if virus is administered directly into the CSF and is not evident if infected by other routes 98 .\n\nHeterologous immunity is the term used to describe the observation that exposure to one pathogen will generate an immune response against numerous antigenic epitopes derived from that pathogen some of which might cross react with epitopes derived from other pathogens. Following infection with the second pathogen, the cross-reactive memory cells expand more rapidly and may dominate the overall response. However, this cross-reactive response may be of low avidity and poorly protective, but may still be able to mediate tissue damage. These circumstances could explain the occurrence of severe disease (dengue haemorrhagic fever-DHF) that affects only a small minority of the 50 million people who are infected with dengue DHF is characterized by high fever, vascular leakage, hypotension, circulatory shock and some bleeding manifestations. It usually occurs in individuals who are already immune to one dengue virus strain and become infected with a heterologous strain. An initial explanation for the DHF syndrome was that it occurred because cross-reactive yet non-neutralizing antibodies opsonized virus for uptake by macrophages 99 . This was proposed to result in immune activation, abundant production of cytokines and vascular leakage. Others now suggest that T cells are the main orchestrators of the disease and that they cross-react with epitopes primed by exposure to a different viral strain 99 . The expanded T cells are non-protective yet they can mediate a severe inflammatory reaction that includes VEGF-A production, the main mediator of vascular leakage. Dengue haemorrhagic fever does not occur as often as might be expected on the basis of this mechanism, which suggests that additional factors are also involved. These include viral virulence, the ability to replicate efficiently and host genetic factors. Clinical and experimental evidence for the proposed pathogenesis of DHF is reviewed in REF 100 .\n\nAnother tissue-damaging human disease that could be explained by the existence of heterologous immunity is infectious mononucleosis. The disease is serious and can last for weeks but it only occurs in a minority of usually young adults who receive a primary infection with EBV. In patients that develop infectious mononucleosis, there is a 5-20 fold increase in circulating T cells, most of which are viral antigen-specific CD8 + T cells. The pathogenesis of infectious mononucleosis is poorly understood but one provocative idea is that the disease is the consequence of heterologous immunity, with infectious mononucleosis only occurring in individuals with EBV cross-reactive T cells at the time of infection 101 . Such cross-reactive T cells are proposed to expand more rapidly than EBVspecific naive T cells induced following infection. However the cross-reactive cells that dominate the response have low affinity for the virus antigen-expressing cells and are unable to adequately control the infection, thereby setting the stage for chronic immunopathology. Supporting this concept, cross-reactivity between the influenza virus matrix protein and the EBV BMLF1 protein has been noted 102 . Experimental evidence that heterologous immunity can account for immunopathological responses in some but not all animals was provided by Kim and colleagues 103 . Other examples of cross-reactivity between different pathogens that influence disease patterns are reviewed in REF 104 .\n\nVariation in clinical responses of individuals to virus infections is influenced by the host genotype. Virulent infectious agents are assumed to have helped to shape our genome and are responsible for the extreme polymorphisms of many loci involved in MHC antigen processing and presentation 105 . There is evidence that the outcome of the virus infection is affected by the HLA alleles expressed 106 , but the influence is usually modest. Thus, resistance to pathogens, including viruses, is directed by multiple genes that act at different stages of the virus-host interaction. For example, at least 250 genes are estimated to affect the outcome of infection by HIV 107 . As a result, the absence or malfunction of a single gene would probably have a negative or minimal effect on the outcome of a virus infection. Exceptions to this generalization include the primary immunodeficiencies that arise from rare monogenic defects and lead to increased susceptibility to various virus infections 108 . Mutations of genes encoding viral receptors and co-receptors can also influence disease susceptibility. For example, individuals with a homozygous 32 base pair deletion in CCchemokine receptor 5 (CCR5, the entry co-receptor for X5 HIV) have increased resistance to HIV compared with heterozygous individuals 109 . Another example is that non-secretors of ABO blood groups are refractory to diarrhea caused by Norwalk virus 110 . Mutations in genes that encode proteins involved in innate defence such as the TLRs can affect the clinical expression of infections 74 but little so far has been reported for viruses. One example is a mutation in UNC93B, which encodes a transmembrane protein involved in TLR signalling 111 . Another is a loss of function mutation of TLR3 74 . Both defects result in defective cytokine production, especially IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2. Affected children develop herpes encephalitis 74, 112 , but curiously not other problems with HSV infection or other viruses.\n\nThe more common scenario that accounts for more severe disease following virus infection is polymorphisms in a few or many genes. Investigations on this topic of have focused on HIV but most changes detected so far have been minor probably because multiple genes affect resistance. This topic has been reviewed recently 106, 113 . Genetic factors have not yet been implicated to explain that around 1% of HIV -infected patients control their infection long term without treatment 114 .\n\nIn addition to host genetics affecting the pattern of disease other sources of genetic material in the host could also influence the outcome. These are the endogenous retrovirus elements, some of which are transcriptionally active, that are estimated to contribute to 8-9% of total human DNA 115 . The others are exogenous viruses that establish persistent infections and are mainly not retroviruses. According to a recent review, every individual may harbour several (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) different chronic viral infections that lie undetected and unsymptomatic 59 . Together these endogenous and exogenous viruses have been referred to as the 'virome' 59 . Already it is known that endogenous retroviruses could help to shape the T cell repertoire, deleting some specificities and expanding others 116 . Resident exogenous viruses might also influence the T cell repertoire and could also influence the activity status of the innate immune system causing, for example, the production of cytokines and altered antigen presentation efficiency of DCs, although this needs to be formally shown. These effects will impact on the balance of response by individuals to exogenous agents. With technological advances in detecting both host polymorphisms and the virome, we anticipate that the influence of these factors on the outcome of virus infection will soon be better understood. This knowledge might provide clues to customize successful preventative and therapeutic approaches for viral infection and associated immunopathology.\n\nWhether a virus infection results in severe, sometimes prolonged, lesions or is resolved with minimal bystander tissue damage depends on numerous factors. Some viruses, for example HIV and HCV, have intrinsic properties that make immune control difficult and attempts to achieve control results in notable tissue damage. Other agents, for example many herpes viruses, are successfully controlled in most individuals, but tissue damage occurs in those individuals that have predisposing genetic or acquired problems with one or more components of innate or adaptive defence. Finally, some infections that are normally well controlled can cause major tissue damage under unusual circumstances. These might relate to dose or route of exposure, age at infection, host genetics, and priming with cross-reacting viruses or co-infection with other agents.\n\nVirus (cytopathic or non-cytopathic) upon entry into the host replicates at the tissue site. Cytopathic virus kills infected cells from which cellular contents including proteases and lysosomal enzymes are released which digest the matrix and create an inflammatory milieu. Neutrophils attracted early after infection release inflammatory mediators. Innate cells recognize viral replication intermediates and secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, which in addition to helping clear the virus contributes to tissue damage. Viral antigens are taken up by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and carried to local draining lymph nodes (LNs). Depending on the cytokine milieu created in the draining LN, different type of T helper (Th) cell responses are induced. Primed CD8 + T cells migrate to the site of infection and kill virally infected cells, thereby contributing to tissue damage. Th cells after migrating to the site of infection also contribute to the tissue damage. In conditions where the control of aggressive Th cells and CD8 + T cells by regulatory T (Treg) cells is impaired and other inhibitory pathways fail to curtail them, tissue damage is the main consequence of viral infection. Th cells also provide help to B cells to secrete antibodies (Abs), which form immune complexes that are deposited in certain tissues such as glomeruli of kidneys and blood vessels to cause immune complex (IC) disease. Regulatory cytokines are shown in green.\n\nEffector T cells upregulate inhibitory receptors such as PD1, TIM3, LAG3, CTLA4 and others such as adenosine receptors (not shown) on their surface. Ligation of these receptors to PDL1, galectin-9 and MHC class II and B7.1/7.2 respectively deliver inhibitory signals to the effector cells and control their inflammatory activity and subsequent tissue damage. Additionally, activated TReg cells specialized innate cells or highly polarized plastic effector cells that can make anti-inflammatory cytokines inhibit effector cell responses (shown by thick lines). Inadequate control (shown by dashed lines) exerted by these pathways under some circumstances results in uncontrolled T cell activation and proliferation causing excessive tissue damage. Question marks (?) are typed next to the receptor pair interaction where in vivo extensive studies have not been performed.\n\nA. Inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mechanism induced after viral infection are enlisted. B. A simplified representation of how the balance between immunity and immunopathology following viral infection may depend upon the balance of anti-and proinflammatory mechanisms. It can be either viral clearance or immunity to re-infection, viral clearance with excessive tissue damage or persistence of the pathogen, which resides in the host either as an subclinical infection, an opportunist or tissue damaging agent.
