{"title": "A clinicopathological study of three cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)", "body": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has affected over 8 400 people worldwide, with most cases in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HK SAR), Singapore and Canada. 1 The largest outbreak worldwide has occurred in Beijing, China with over 2 500 cases. The causative agent is a novel coronavirus, which has not been detected previously in human populations. It has been isolated in culture and detected by electron microscopy and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from a range of clinical specimens. In addition, serological evidence of infection has been found in most patients fitting the clinical definition of SARS, although antibody responses may be slow to develop. [2] [3] [4] [5] The genome of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been sequenced from multiple clinical isolates. 6 SARS is fatal in at least 10% of cases, with a higher mortality in the elderly or where the person has underlying diabetes, heart or lung disease, or impaired immunity. 5, 7, 8 An understanding of the pathogenesis and histopathological features of SARS-CoV infection is essential to the management of the disease.\n\nDuring the SARS outbreak in Beijing, 200 patients with suspected/probable SARS were admitted to Youan Hospital, Beijing (a designated SARS hospital during the outbreak) from 9 March to 9 April 2003, of whom 15 died within two weeks of onset of the illness. We performed autopsies on three patients and report the pathological characteristics of these cases.\n\nPatient 1 was a 73-year-old man with a medical history of lung cancer who came to Beijing from Shanxi province and died nine days after the onset of his illness. He presented with a self-reported fever of 38.5 \u2021C, chills, dyspnoea and a minimally productive cough. Laboratory studies included a white blood cell (WBC) count of 1.9610 9 /L with 28% lymphocytes. A chest radiograph showed interstitial infiltrates in both left and right lungs. He had had contact with a patient with atypical pneumonia before his hospitalisation. He had received 400 mg of methylpredisolone during the five days before death.\n\nPatient 2 was a 64-year-old woman with diabetes who died 15 days after onset of her illness.\n\nPatient 3 was a 69-year-old woman with diabetes, hypertension and heart disease who died 13 days after the onset of her illness. Patients 2 and 3 were both hospitalised with a high fever (39 \u2021C), chills and dyspnoea. Laboratory studies included a WBC of 3.7610 9 /L with 16% lymphocytes in Patient 2 and 5.7610 9 /L with 8% lymphocytes in Patient 3. Chest radiographs showed interstitial infiltrates in the lower and middle zones of the lungs for both patients. Patients 2 and 3 both lived in Beijing. Prior to her hospitalisation, Patient 2 had a history of contact with a family member who had a fever and a cough, whereas Patient 3 reported contact with an unrelated individual with fever and cough. Five-micrometre sections were deparaffinised, rehydrated, and digested with proteinase K (30 mg/ml) for 15 minutes at 37 \u2021C, followed by reverse transcription (RT). The RT reaction mixture contained 4 ml 56 first round buffer, 1 ml of 0.5 mg/ml oligo dT (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA), 1 ml of 10 mM dNTP, 2 ml of 0.1M dithiothreitol (dTT), 1 ml of 40 u/ ml RNasin and 1 ml of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase (200 U//ml Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and diethylpolycarbonate (DEPC)-treated H 2 O to a final reaction volume of 20 ml. The 20 ml mixture was added to each section and the slides placed in a moist chamber for a 60-minute incubation at 37 \u2021C. The reaction was terminated by heating at 70 \u2021C for 15 minutes.\n\nThe PCR mixture contained 4 ml 106 PCR buffer (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands), 2 ml digoxigenin (dig)-dNTPs (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), 1 ml each of the cor-F3 and cor-R1 primers, 0.5 ml Taq polymerase (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) and DEPCtreated H 2 O to a 40 ml total volume. The residual fluid was gently decanted from the slides and the 40 ml PCR mixture added to each slide. The slides were covered with a clean coverslip and cemented with wax oil. Thermal cycling parameters were a single cycle of 95 \u2021C denaturation for 3 minutes, then 20 cycles at 95 \u2021C for 50 seconds and 68 \u2021C for 3 minutes, followed by a final reaction extension at 72 \u2021C extension for 5 minutes. To ensure specificity, dNTP instead of dig-dNTP was used as a negative control.\n\nWax oil on the slides was cleared with xylene and the coverslips carefully removed. The tissue samples were fixed by adding 4% polyformaldehyde and acetic anhydride/triethanolamine, and blocked by goat serum. Anti-digoxigenin-AP (1:500) antibody was added to the samples on slides and incubated at 37 \u2021C for 60 minutes. Slides were washed gently. Nitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indole-phosphate (NBT/BCIP) (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) staining solution was added to the slides and examined. The slides were sealed with glycerol.\n\nBaseline full blood count, biochemistry, liver function tests, coagulation studies and CD4z and CD8z T lymphocyte counts (measured by flow cytometry) are listed in Table 1 . Of note was the low WBC count, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia (CD4z and CD8z cells), in addition to marked hyponatremia. The patients had not received ribavirin therapy. Convalescent sera were not available from these patients for SARS-CoV-specific antibody testing.\n\nThere was a small amount of pink or red fluid in the thoracic cavity, without evidence of pleural adhesions, seen in the three patients. The lungs displayed surface erythema and were firm to touch (Fig. 1) . The lungs all floated on water. There was a small amount of pink or red fluid when the lungs were cut. Red serous fluid was observed in the bronchi and respiratory tract of all patients.\n\nNearly every lobe of the lungs from each patient showed diffuse serous inflammation. The alveolar capillaries were markedly expanded with hyperaemia. The alveolar walls were oedematous with a combined lymphocytic and mononuclear cell infiltrate. There was active proliferation of Type II alveolar epithelial cells and interstitial cells. A light red-coloured, homogeneous fibrinous deposition was observed on the alveolar walls. The capillary basement membranes were thickened and expanded from the pulmonary alveolar walls. There was desquamation of pneumocytes and a light-red exudative fluid containing fibrin, red blood cells (RBC), macrophages and epithelial PATHOLOGY OF SARS cells in many alveolar spaces (Fig. 2, 3) . Hyaline-membrane formation was observed in some alveoli (Fig. 4) . Viral-like inclusions were identified in Patients 1 and 2; these looked like homogeneous red-coloured bodies with a halo-like envelope on H & E staining (Fig. 5) . Typical large multinucleated syncytial cells were absent in all the three cases. We observed only a few multinucleated cells containing 3-4 nuclei. Other changes included bronchiolar submucosal oedema, inflammatory cell infiltrates, and desquamation and focal hyperplasia of epithelial cells. Many neutrophils and fibrous thrombi were found in the adjacent vessels (Fig. 6) . No haemophagocytosis was seen, and there was no evidence of secondary bacterial pneumonia. Examination by electron microscopy was not performed.\n\nThe normal architecture of lung hilar lymph nodes was destroyed, with obvious expansion of lymphatic sinuses and vessels. The lymphocytes in the cortical regions were greatly reduced and the germinal centre lost. There was marked proliferation of macrophages in subcapsular sinuses. Vacuolated lipid was found in cytoplasmic spaces of macrophages (Fig. 7) . Focal necrotic inflamma-tion was present in the lymph nodes of the hilum of the lung, but not in any other lymph nodes. The spleens were soft and the splenic pulp was difficult to scrape down. The splenic changes included white pulp atrophy, depletion of lymphocytes around lymphatic sheaths, and reduced lymphocytes in the red pulp. Focal haemorrhagic necrotic inflammation was observed near the splenic capsule (Fig. 8) .\n\nThe hepatocytes showed some oedema and fatty degeneration in liver lobules. There was active proliferation of Kupffer cells and the hepatic portals were swollen slightly with lymphocytic infiltrates (Fig. 9) .\n\nPathological changes in heart tissues included atrophied cardiac muscle fibres with lipofuscin deposition in the cytoplasm, and some proliferation of interstitial cells and lymphocytes. The renal cortices were thin. The renal tubules displayed hydropic degeneration or swelling and some protein casts were present. In Patient 3, there was obvious glomerular fibrosis with corresponding tubular fibrosis and atrophy, leading to compensatory hypertrophy in remnant glomeruli. The acini of the pancreas were slightly atrophied with a mild lymphocytic infiltration. Most islets were atrophied with a pink matrix deposition in the pancreas of two patients. Adrenal glands showed extensive haemorrhage and necrosis. The small intestine had no evidence of mucosal injury, hyperaemia and or submucosal oedema. There was submucosal distribution of lymphocytes. There was no pathological damage in the colon.\n\nMolecular tests SARS-CoV RNA was detected in lung tissue sections from the three patients. The positive signals were located in the Type II alveolar epithelial cells, interstitial cells and bronchiolar cells. The distribution of positive cells were scattered throughout the lung tissue (Fig. 10) . The slides treated with dNTP instead of dig-dNTP were negative.\n\nWe describe the laboratory features and postmortem changes in different tissues from three patients who died during the SARS outbreak in Beijing. As expected, the predominant damage was evident in the lungs and was characterised by acute exudative and haemorrhagic inflammation. Capillary permeability increased markedly as part of the SARS-CoV infection (possibly exacerbated by toxins or coinfection with other pathogens), leading to a leakage of proteins and RBC into the alveolar walls and spaces. There was diffuse alveolar damage, with accumulation of exudate and oedema in alveolar spaces and evidence of hyaline-membrane formation in some alveolar spaces. 2, [7] [8] [9] These features were present in all three patients, whose length of disease ranged from nine to 15 days, a period of time shorter than in most SARS cases where lung pathology has been reported. 2, 5, 8, 9 Other patients who had lung tissue examined early after disease onset showed similar findings. 9 Giant multinucleated syncytial cells were not seen in this study. These cells were evident in less than half of the patients where lung tissue was collected in the first two weeks of disease. 4, 7, 9 Cynomologus macaques experimentally infected with SARS-CoV and sacrificed six days post inoculation showed a similar interstitial pneumonia of differing severity. 10 Haemophagocytosis has been reported only occasionally. 9 A three-stage process has been described with acute respiratory lung disease, including an inflammatory or exudative phase, a proliferative phase, and a final fibrotic phase when the illness is of longer duration. 9, 11 The variable degree of exudative inflammation present in different lobes or parts of lobes of the lungs probably represents evolution in the progression of SARS. Other abnormal changes were noted, including hydropic degeneration, fatty degeneration and interstitial cell proliferation that might be caused by the pathogen, or pathogeninduced damage such as hyperpyrexia or hypoxia. The thickened capillary basement membranes, alveolar wall oedema, interstitial cell proliferation, apoptosis and loss of alveolar epithelial cells, exudation, accumulation of proteins and RBC would result in reduced air exchange and oxygenation. Impaired ventilation would result from the bronchiolar hyperaemia and oedema, and the lymphocyte and monocyte infiltration, leading to anoxia, dyspnoea and eventual respiratory failure.\n\nThis report confirms that the lung is the main target of the SARS-CoV. In the lung of Patients 1 and 2, virus-like inclusion bodies were observed in pulmonary epithelial cells. These are likely to represent SARS-CoV located in type I and II pulmonary epithelial cells, a feature noted by others. 9 We detected SARS-CoV RNA using in situ RT-PCR, with positive cells distributed in alveolar epithelial cells, pulmonary interstitial cells and bronchiolar epithelial cells. These are consistent with electron microscopy findings of virus-like particles in lung tissue from patients with SARS. 4, 9, 12 Others have noted that detection of viral particles is not a constant feature, although this probably reflects the timing of lung tissue sampling. 2, 5, [7] [8] [9] A novel observation was the damage to pulmonary hilar lymph nodes including loss of lymphocytes in the cortical regions, loss of the germinal centre, and macrophage proliferation in subcapsular sinuses. Splenic changes were similar to the one other report of splenic histopathology, 9 although others have reported only lung involvement. 8 The SARS-CoV is readily detected by RT-PCR, often for some weeks, in faeces from patients with SARS, although we did not find obvious pathological changes in the gastrointestinal tract. It is possible that different modes of transmission (respiratory, fomites or faecal-oral) may influence the pathological findings in different tissues.\n\nInterpreting the histopathological features of acute SARS is somewhat confounded by the fact that published reports often include only limited autopsies, many patients had been given high-dose corticosteroids, and underlying comorbidities (and pathogens) may have been present. 2, 5, [7] [8] [9] Two of the patients in this study had other medical problems, such as diabetes, hypertension and lung cancer, and one had been given corticosteroid therapy. A number of the pathological features noted here, including renal glomerular hyalinisation and amyloid degeneration of pancreas, were likely to be secondary to diabetes or hypertension. Occasional carcinoma cells were observed in the pulmonary cavity of Patient 1.\n\nHyponatremia (seen in all three patients) occurs in at least 20% of patients with SARS, and is associated with a poorer outcome. 8, 13 The lymphopenia (including CD4z and CD8z T-lymphocytes), thrombocytopenia and abnormal liver function tests observed in our three patients are frequent findings in severe SARS. 7, 8, 13 The pathological mechanisms of tissue damage and pathogenesis of SARS are being actively pursued. Our data showed that the patients who died relatively early in the illness have acute pulmonary damage, associated with peripheral neutropenia and lymphopenia, and it is likely that these effects are involved in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection. Immunological injury is likely to be of pathologic importance in this disease, as it is in animal coronavirus infections such as feline infectious peritonitis. 14 "}
