Tables S1-S4 Figures S1-S6", "body": "Fitted parameters defined by the smooth line through each of the data sets are summarized in Table S1 . emission intensity, specifically in this context, is comparable to that observed in the double-labeled Cy3-5'TRS-Cy5-3'-cTRS duplex (see Fig. 6C , main text). This enhancement is consistent with proteininduced fluorescence emission (PIFE). 2 "}
