{"title": "Cell attachment protein VP8* of a human rotavirus specifically interacts with A-type histo-blood group antigen", "body": "Expression, purification, and crystallization of P[14] VP8* and its complex with A-type oligosaccharides, and structure determination, using RRV VP8* structure (PDB id: 1KQR) as a molecular replacement model, and refinement were carried out as described in the Supplementary Methods section. Diffraction data were collected at Baylor College of Medicine using Rigaku FR-E+ SuperBright rotating anode. See Table S2 for data collection and refinement statistics. The carbohydrate-binding specificity of P[14] VP8* was investigated using glycan array v4.2 with 511 glycans in replicates of 6 (Consortium for Functional Glycomics Protein-Glycan Interaction Core (H) (http://www.functionalglycomics). GST-tagged VP8* bound on the glycan array was detected using a fluorescent-labeled anti-GST monoclonal antibody. Infectivity assays were performed as previously described3,27.\n\nVP8* (aa 64-224) of HAL1166 rotavirus strain (P[14] genotype) was cloned into an expression vector pGEX-2T (GE healthcare) with an N-terminal GST tag and a thrombin cleavage site. The recombinant GST-VP8* was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) and purified by Glutathione Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE healthcare). The GST tag was cleaved by using thrombin before rebinding the protein mixtures onto a Glutathione Sepharose column to remove the GST, leaving Gly-Ser at the N terminus. The VP8* was then filtered and further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex-75 (GE healthcare) column with 10 mM Tris, pH7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT. The concentration of the purified VP8* was determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm and using an absorption coefficient of 43,010 M\u22121cm\u22121 calculated using Vector NTI 11 software (Invitrogen).\n\nCrystallization conditions for P[14] VP8* (13.5 mg/ml) were screened by hanging-drop vapor diffusion using the Mosquito crystallization robot (TTP LabTech) and visualized using Rock Imager (Formulatrix) at 20\u00b0C. The crystals from one of the conditions (30% PEG 1500, sodium acetate trihydrate, pH 4.5) were harvested with the screen condition containing 18% glycerol. To obtain crystals of VP8*-HBGA complex, VP8* was co-crystallized with A-type trisaccharide or tetrasaccharide (purchased from Dextra labs), with a 1:52 or 1:46 excess molar ratio of ligand under similar condition as the unliganded P[14] VP8*.\n\nDiffraction data for both unliganded and liganded VP8* crystals were collected at Baylor College of Medicine using Rigaku FR-E+ SuperBright rotating anode. These data were processed with DTREK28 or IMOSFLM as implemented in the CCP4 suite29. Space group was confirmed using POINTLESS30. The unliganded and liganded VP8* structures in the P21 space group, with one molecule in the asymmetric unit, at ~1.5\u00c5 resolution were determined. For initial phasing, the RRV VP8* structure (PDB id:1KQR ) was used as a search model for molecular replacement using Phaser31. Following automated model building and solvent addition using ARP/wARP32, the structure was refined using PHENIX33. The oligosaccharide moieties of the HBGAs were generated using the SWEET 2 package34 of the Glycosciences.de server (http://www.glycosciences.de) and modeled into the electron density using COOT35 and validated by computing simulated annealing omit maps using PHENIX33. The stereochemistry of the oligosaccharides including the allowed conformational angles was checked using the CARP36 package in the Glycosciences.de server (http://www.glycosciences.de). Data collection and refinement statistics are given in Table S2. Ligand interactions were analyzed using COOT and LIGPLOT37 with donor to acceptor distances between 2.6 \u00c5 and 3.2 \u00c5 for hydrogen bonding interactions, and C-C distances between 3.4 \u00c5 and 4.5 \u00c5 for hydrophobic interactions. The structural alignments and calculations of rmsd were carried out using the PyMOL (http://pymol.sourceforge.net). Figures were prepared by using Chimera38.\n\nThe carbohydrate-binding specificity of HAL1166 VP8* was investigated on glycan array v4.2 comprised of 511 glycans (Consortium for Functional Glycomics, Protein-Glycan Interaction Core-H) (http://www.functionalglycomics). Recombinant GST-tagged VP8* at decreasing concentrations in binding buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM sodium chloride, 2 mM calcium chloride, 2 mM magnesium chloride, 0.05% Tween 20, 1% BSA) was applied to separate glycan arrays, and bound protein was detected using a fluorescent-labeled anti-GST monoclonal antibody. Summary of the glycan array results is given in Table S1. Concentration dependent binding at 20 \u03bcg/ml and 2 \u03bcg/ml is shown in Fig. S1a and S1b, where the glycans are ranked according to their relative binding strengths (Fig. S1c) as described previously39.\n\nInhibition assays were performed on HT29 (human intestinal epithelial) cells following previously described protocols40. The monoclonal antibody (MAb) against blood group A antigen (BG-2) was purchased from Covance. The isotype control antibody (MG3-35) was purchased from Abcam. HAL1166 virus was grown as previously described41. Confluent HT29 cell monolayers were grown on 96-well plates. Increasing concentrations of antibodies were allowed to bind to the cells at 4\u00b0C for 1 hour before 400 fluorescent focus units (FFU) of virus were added per well. Recombinant VP8* protein competition was determined by treating the cells with 62.5 or 31 \u03bcg/ml VP8* at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min before virus inoculation as above. After allowing virus attachment to HT29 cells for 1 hour on ice, the inoculum was removed, and the cells were washed with cold DMEM and incubated for 16 hours at 37\u00b0C in 95% (vol/vol) air with 5% (vol/vol) CO2. Virus titers in methanol-fixed cell monolayers were determined by staining cells with rabbit anti-RV antibody and Alexa 488-labeled donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen). Virus infectivity was expressed as the percentage of focus-forming units in control wells incubated with the same concentrations of bovine serum albumin. Data are given as the mean of three replicates, and the bar indicates the standard deviation. Data were analyzed by Student's t test (two-tailed test).\n\nFor infectivity assays, SA11, HAL1166 or K8 viruses were serially diluted and incubated on confluent monolayers in 96 wells plates of HT29, Caco-2, and CHO cells (parental cells or cells expressing type H HBGA, or type H and type A HBGA prepared as previously described42). Following attachment for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C, the cells were washed, incubated for 16 hours and processed as described above for immunofluorescence.\n\nPooled human red blood cells (RBCs) were purchased from Immucor (Atlanta, GA). The RBCs were packed via centrifugation at 500 \u00d7 g for ten minutes and 0.5% suspensions of each RBC type were prepared in 0.85% saline (pH 6.2). GST (negative control) or GST-tagged VP8* were serially diluted via doubling dilution in PBS (0.01 M sodium phosphate, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 5.5; passed through a 0.2-\u03bcm-pore-size filter) on 96-well V-bottom plates (Nunc, Naperville, Ill.) in triplicate. The HA activity of the VP8 dimers was tested by mixing 50 uL of the prep (starting dilution of 10 nM) with an equal volume of the RBC suspensions. Recombinant Norovirus virus-like particles (Norwalk virus, genogroup GI.1 and Houston virus, genogroup GII.4) were included as positive controls (5 ug/ml and 10 ug/ml starting dilutions, respectively) because they have well-characterized HA activity that is known to be mediated by interaction with histo-blood group antigens on the surface of the RBCs43. The reaction was allowed to proceed for one hour at 4\u00b0C before results were recorded. The titer recorded was the highest dilution of sample that prevented the complete sedimentation of RBCs to the bottom of the well as compared to the negative controls. A commercial blood typing antibody specific for the B antigen was purchased from Immucor and tested at a starting dilution of 1:100 as another positive control."}
