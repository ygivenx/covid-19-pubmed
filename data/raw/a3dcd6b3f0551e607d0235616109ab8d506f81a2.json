{"title": "Title: Analyzing Vaccine Trials in Epidemics with Mild and Asymptomatic Infection", "body": "In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) identified a list of priority pathogens with potential to cause future public health emergencies of international concern (1). The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has dedicated one billion dollars to vaccine development efforts starting with three of these: Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, Lassa virus and Nipah virus (2) . These three pathogens, as well as others on the WHO's list, such as Zika virus, have high proportions of asymptomatic or mild infection (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . Vaccine efficacy against susceptibility to infection (VES) (8) , regardless of symptom level, is an important endpoint of vaccine trials for these pathogens, as infection may contribute to onward transmission, and outcomes such as Congenital Zika Syndrome, even without primary symptoms (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . However, VES is resource-intensive to estimate as it requires testing all trial participants, either by periodically conducting assays for infection throughout the trial, or by serologic testing at the trial's conclusion if natural and vaccine-derived immune responses can be distinguished. Testing trial participants is also necessary for estimating a vaccine's efficacy against progression (VEP) to symptoms, another critical outcome measurement (8) . As noted in an analysis of dengue vaccine trial results, protection against symptomatic infection may in general differ from protection against infection (and in the case of dengue, VEP may be negative due to antibody dependent enhancement) (15) . It is therefore important to consider estimates of both VES and VEP when analyzing trial results.\n\nWe aim to identify a methodology to accurately estimate VES and VEP when only a limited amount of information is available, and resources -both time and money -are constrained. Throughout, we use \"asymptomatic\" synonymously with \"subclinical\" to mean any .

The model is compartmental, using deterministic (differential equation) dynamics for the main population and stochastic dynamics in the communities. We simulate an epidemic in the main population with a seasonal transmission rate that generates an epidemic curve with a shape similar to the epidemic curve of the 2015 Zika outbreak in Brazil (17) . The disease is introduced into communities via infectious contact with the main population, and transmission occurs when infected individuals transmit to their susceptible connections in the communities. All susceptible individuals have a daily probability of infection from each of their infectious neighbors of 1-e -\u03b2 , where \u03b2 is the force of infection, as well as a daily external hazard of infection from the main population, which varies with the prevalence in the main population. The disease natural history follows a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious/Symptomatic (or Infectious/Asymptomatic)-Recovered (SEIS(IAS)R) model, with estimated incubation and infectious periods of a Zika-like disease (Supplementary Table 1 ).\n\nVector transmission is not directly modeled, so the serial interval of the simulated disease is shorter than that of Zika virus disease. Symptomatic and asymptomatic infections are assumed to be equally infectious, and whether an individual is infected by a symptomatic or an asymptomatic individual does not affect their probability of becoming symptomatic. The baseline parameters of the model assume 20% of those infected in both the vaccine and control .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/295337 doi: bioRxiv preprint groups become symptomatic, based on the estimated proportion of Zika infections that are symptomatic (9) . The epidemic and the vaccine trial are simulated in both a network of individuals grouped into five relatively disconnected communities as well as in a network of individuals in one large community.\n\n7.5% of the individuals in the communities are enrolled into a 150-day long trial, and individuals are randomized to the vaccine or control groups. All individuals enrolled into the trial are assumed to be na\u00efve to the infection, which in practice might require serologic testing of all individuals prior to enrollment. The vaccine is leaky, meaning it reduces the probability of infection upon each exposure to an infectious individual. The daily probability of infection from vaccinees' infectious contacts is 1-e -\u03b2(1-VE) , where VE is the assumed direct leaky multiplicative vaccine efficacy (8, 18) . VES is estimated with seven different approaches, which are described in Table 1 . Trial status (i.e. vaccine or control) is the explanatory variable for all Cox proportional hazards models, and individuals who are never infected are censored at the end of the trial. Approach 1 assumes that the time of infection is known exactly (to the day) even for asymptomatic infections and therefore would be strictly applicable only where very frequent testing is performed throughout the trial. Approach 2 assumes that infection is unobserved for asymptomatic infections, so only symptomatic infections are included in the Cox regression, and those infected asymptomatically are assumed to have survived without infection to the end of follow up.\n\nBecause this latter approach leads to bias in estimating VES (see Figure 1 and Results), we consider five additional approaches.\n\nIn the interval censored Cox models, the exact day of infection for the symptomatic individuals is known (and in practice would be laboratory-confirmed). For the asymptomatically . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/295337 doi: bioRxiv preprint infected individuals, the interval for day of infection ranges from the day of their last negative serologic test to the day of their first positive serologic test. Two different interval lengths are assessed to determine if increased frequency of testing yields more precise results (19) . As mentioned above, this method assumes the ability of the serologic test to distinguish between vaccine acquired immunity and naturally acquired immunity, currently possible for some but not all vaccines/pathogens (20-22).\n\nThe results from the network with five communities are analyzed first with the same seven approaches, treating the five communities as if they were one large community.\n\nAlternatively, to account for the potential for heterogeneity in hazard rates between communities, the Cox models in Approaches 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 are stratified by community (16) , and estimates from Approaches 3 and 4 are calculated separately within each community and meta-analyzed using inverse-variance weighting.\n\nEmpirical coverage probabilities are calculated by the proportion of simulations with 95% confidence intervals that cover the true VES parameter of the model (60%). Power is estimated by the proportion of simulations in which P < 0.05 for the null hypothesis of VES=0 and the estimated VES is greater than 0. The trial is also simulated with fewer participants to assess power in smaller trials.\n\nAdditionally, to evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing progression to symptoms, VEP is estimated by:\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/295337 doi: bioRxiv preprint Finally, to assess whether the results hold in other contexts, trial parameters such as trial length, VES, and the proportion of the infected individuals in each arm of the trial that becomes symptomatic, are varied.\n\nR code for these analyses is available at: https://github.com/rek160/Asymptomatic-Infection-Vaccine-Efficacy. Figure 2 displays the results of the median of 500 simulations in the single-community network, showing VES estimates from the seven approaches described above across three values of R0, the basic reproductive number. As expected, Approach 1 returns accurate VES estimates, while Approach 2 returns estimates biased towards the null because there is differential overestimation of person-time at risk, with worse overestimates in the controls (Figure 1 ). This bias is exacerbated as R0 increases. Approach 3 returns an estimate biased toward the null compared to the true value of VES, also as expected and also worsened at higher levels of R0 (8) .\n\nApproach 4 corrects this bias by converting the risk-based analysis into a rate-based analysis (18, 23 ).\n\nThe interval censored Cox proportional hazards models (Approaches 5-6) return estimates approximately equal to the VES input into the model. These approaches require fewer resources than would be necessitated by the Cox model with perfect knowledge of infection time (Approach 1) because they use only three or one serologic tests, respectively, rather than frequent monitoring for infection throughout the period of follow-up. Approach 6, the interval censored Cox model with testing only at the end of the trial, yields the same results as Approach 5, testing three times, without substantial difference in coverage probability or power in the .

Thus, both Approaches 4 and 6 yield accurate estimates with testing only required once at the end of the trial.\n\nEven a single serologic test could be resource-intensive. Approach 7, which only requires testing 10% of the trial participants at the end of the trial, results in accurate estimates of VES ( Figure 2 ) for all values of R0 considered and of VEP (Table 3) for R0 values of 1.25 or 1.50.\n\nOnly testing 10% of the trial participants once at the end of the trial substantially reduces required resources. However, when the number of cases is very low (Supplementary Table 2 ), the sample does not accurately estimate VEP, and this approach is less efficient than others in many of the settings considered (i.e. wider confidence intervals, see Supplementary Table 3 These approaches work in both trials conducted in one large community and trials conducted in disconnected communities, such as the recent malaria trials (24). In trials with more communities or increased heterogeneity, the bias from heterogeneity in hazard rates will likely be more pronounced (16) . Methods to account for this heterogeneity, such as stratification, metaanalyses, or incorporation of random effects, should therefore be used; although when the number of cases is very low, some of these methods may be imprecise.\n\n.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/295337 doi: bioRxiv preprint While Approaches 4-7 require substantially fewer resources for estimating VES and VEP than Approach 1 and are more accurate than Approaches 2-3, all participants must be tested at the beginning of the trial to ensure they are not exposed or immune. Including those with preexisting immunity in the trial would reduce the total number of overall cases, and thus the power, limiting the ability to draw a statistically significant conclusion about the vaccine's effects. This challenge however is not limited to diseases with high proportions of mild or asymptomatic infection, as prior immunity would reduce the power of any trial. Additionally, distinguishing between natural and vaccine-derived immunity can be challenging, especially at the beginning of an outbreak of an emerging infectious disease about which not much is known and for which serologic tests are likely in early stages of development (22,25). Therefore, investments in diagnostic development will also be critical for ensuring accurate VE estimates. Finally, many simplifying assumptions are made, including complete ascertainment of infectious cases, perfect sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test, and comparability of the infected vaccinees and infected controls for the estimation of VEP (8) .\n\nWe have identified methods that accurately estimate VES and VEP and only require serologic testing of trial participants once at the end of the trial. Only acquiring serological endpoints in a 10% sample yields unbiased VES estimates, significantly reducing required resources. While parameterized for a Zika-like disease, the methods and exact parameters described above are not meant to represent a particular epidemic context, but merely to serve as a guide when thinking through how to accurately estimate important endpoints of vaccine trials in different settings with limited resources and information. R code for this simple model can be readily modified to reflect disease-, vaccine-and setting-specific parameters. Identifying resource-preserving methods is important in designing trials for diseases with a high proportion .

This bias is exacerbated as R0 increases and more people in the control group become infected but are still perceived to be at risk. At time t post randomization, person time at-risk in the controls will be overestimated by a factor e Q(R)(MNS T U)(MNS V ) relative to the vaccine group, where \u039b(t) is the cumulative hazard to time t, p is the symptomatic proportion in controls, and 1-\u03b8 Z and 1-\u03b8 [ are the efficacy of the vaccine against infection, and disease given infection, respectively (27).
