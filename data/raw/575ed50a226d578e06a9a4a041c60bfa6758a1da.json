{"title": "PIN: A Novel Protein Involved in IFN-\u03b3 Accumulation of NOS-1 in Neurons", "body": "Interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) plays a crucial early antiviral role in protection against viral infection in the central nervous system (CNS) (Komatsu et al., 1999; Rodriguez et al., 2003) . IFN-\u03b3 treatment results in nitric oxide synthase-1 (NOS-1) accumulation posttranscriptionally. Viral clearance from neurons is associated with increased NO production both in vitro and in the CNS (Bi and Reiss, 1995; Komatsu et al., 1996; Chesler et al., 2004) . The regulation and the mechanism of this phenomenon largely remain unknown. Protein inhibitor of NOS-1 (PIN) is degraded following IFN-\u03b3 treatment; more ubiquitin-modified PIN and a shorter half-life are observed in IFN-\u03b3-treated neuronal cells (Yang et al., 2006) . We propose that PIN is centrally involved in the IFN-\u03b3-mediated accumulation of NOS-1 and antiviral responses in neurons.\n\nLocalization and activation of NOS enzymes are regulated via protein-protein interactions (Alderton et al., 2001; Dedio et al., 2001) . Of the three NOS isoforms, NOS-1 is the largest due to a 300-amino-acid PDZ (PSD-95/Discs large/zona occludens-1) domain insertion at the N terminus, targeting the protein to the postsynaptic density (PSD). Several proteins have been identified to interact with NOS-1 in neurons and modulate its activity. The PSD protein PSD-95 binds and anchors NOS-1 in a complex with the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) (Christopherson et al., 1999) . Carboxy-terminal PDZ ligand of nNOS (CAPON) competes with PSD-95 for interaction with NOS-1 in the PSD of synaptic spines (Jaffrey et al., 1998) , and is thought to reduce the capability of NOS-1 to produce NO. Nitric oxide synthaseinteracting protein (NO-SIP) interacts and colocalizes with NOS-1 in synaptic spines and inhibits NOS activity (Dreyer et al., 2004) . In the CNS, NOS-1 is activated by Ca 2+ influx through the NMDA glutamate receptor, triggering of the NMDAR kinase (Putzke et al., 2000) .\n\nA 10 kDa protein that physically interacts with and inhibits the activity of NOS-1 was identified using a yeast two-hybrid screen. The protein was named Protein Inhibitor of Neuronal NOS (Jaffrey and Snyder, 1996a) . PIN and NMDAR colocalize with NOS-1 in penile nerves (Ferrini et al., 2003) . The PIN-binding region of NOS-1 maps to a 17-residue peptide fragment from Met-228 to His-244 of NOS-1 (Fan et al., 1998) . PIN binding destabilizes the NOS-1 homodimer, a conformation necessary for enzymatic activity (Dunbar et al., 2004) . Prostaglandin E2, an inhibitor of NOS-1, induces PIN expression in neurons; Celecoxib \u2122 treatment, which enhances NOS-1 activity, inhibits PIN expression (Chen and Reiss, 2002) . In addition, PIN inhibits NO and superoxide production by purified NOS-1 (Xia et al., 2006) . IFN-\u03b3 treatment prolongs the half-life of NOS-1 (Yang et al., 2006) . In neurons, PIN is posttranscriptionally downregulated by IFN-\u03b3 treatment; more ubiquitination and faster degradation of PIN are detected in IFN-\u03b3-treated samples (Yang et al., 2006) . In this study, we examine the turnover and interaction of PIN and NOS-1 following IFN-\u03b3 treatment. To assess this, RNA interference (RNAi) and overexpression techniques were employed. The results demonstrate that in neuronal cells, IFN-\u03b3 enhances NOS-1 and antiviral activity through down-regulation of PIN.\n\nNB41A3 cells and L929 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). NB41A3 cells were maintained in F-12K medium containing 15% horse serum, 2.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37\u00b0C and 5% carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) (Komatsu et al., 1996) . L929 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) lowglucose media containing 10% FBS, 1 mM L-glutamine, HEPES buffer, and 1% penicillin/ streptomycin at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 (Reiss et al., 1983) . Unless otherwise stated, all tissue culture reagents were obtained from Mediatech (Herndon, VA). Anti-vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Indiana serotype, San Juan strain, originally obtained from Alice S. Huang (then at the Children's Hospital, Boston, MA) was used in all viral studies. VSV was propagated in Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified over a sucrose gradient as previously described (Chang et al., 1994) . Recombinant murine IFN-\u03b3 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and used at a concentration of 20 ng/mL in all experiments.\n\nMouse anti-mouse NOS-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (1:2000 for Western blot) and rabbit anti-mouse NOS-1 polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) were purchased from BD Pharmingen (San Jose, CA). Rat anti-mouse PIN mAb (1:500 for Western blot, 1:50 for IP) was purchased from Axxora (San Diego, CA). Anti-GAPDH mAb (1:100,000 for Western blot) was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Anti-Xpress mAb was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Sheep anti-VSV pAb was a generous gift from Dr. Alice S. Huang (when at the Children's Hospital, Boston, MA). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:2000) was purchased from Vector (Southfield, MI). Donkey anti-sheep (1:4000) and donkey anti-rabbit (1:5000) secondary antibodies, both HRP conjugated, were purchased from Jackson Immunologicals (West Grove, PA) and Zymed (South San Francisco, CA), respectively.\n\nViral titers were determined in triplicates using serially diluted culture supernatants on monolayers of L929 cells as previously described (Komatsu et al., 1996) . The geometric mean and geometric mean error of the titer were calculated, and the groups were compared statistically using analysis of variance (ANOVA).\n\nmRNA levels were determined by multiplex RT-PCR using the Qiagen One-Step RT-PCR kit (Valencia, CA). Total RNA (100 ng) was used in each reaction. The following protocol was used to carry out the reaction: 50\u00b0C for 30 min, 95 \u00b0C for 15 min, 36 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 58\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 1 min, then 72\u00b0C for 10 min, and 4\u00b0C hold. The primers used in these reactions are listed in Table 1 . Products were resolved by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, stained using ethidium bromide (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) or Sybr-Gold dye (Invitrogen), and visualized using a UV transilluminator. Results were digitally photographed using a Kodak DC290 camera controlled by the Kodak 1D analytic software (Kodak, Rochester, NY). DNA band densities were determined using the UN-SCAN-IT software.\n\nThe concentration of NO 2 \u2212 in culture supernatants was determined by assaying the stable end product of NO (Hewett, 1999) .\n\nCells were lysed, and proteins were analyzed by Western blot (Chesler et al., 2004) . Protein band densities were quantitated by UN-SCAN-IT software.\n\nFlat 96-well plates were coated with capture antibody (anti-NOS mAb 500 ng/well, or anti-PIN mAb 100 ng/well) diluted in 100 \u03bcL coating buffer (0.1 M sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.6) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. The plates were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Tween-20 and air dried. Two hundred \u03bcL (0.5 mg/mL) of the test sample was added to duplicate wells and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Wells were washed five times as above and blocked with 100 \u03bcL 2% dried milk powder/PBS (BLOTTO) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Following another five washes, detecting antibody (anti-NOS mAb 10 \u03bcg/mL, or anti-PIN mAb 10 \u03bcg/mL) diluted in 100 \u03bcL BLOTTO was added to plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. Wells were washed and incubated with secondary antibody for 30 min (HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG 1:1000 or anti-Rat IgM 1:500). TMB substrate was added, and 15 min later the reaction was stopped by TMB Stopping Solution (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The reaction produces a yellow-to-orange color, which was quantified at 450 nm by microplate reader.\n\nsiRNA targeting PIN, a negative control siRNA, and the siPORT \u2122 Amine \u00ae transfection reagent were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). The siRNA was transfected into NB41A3 cells according to the instruction of the manufacturer's manual (Ambion). Briefly, the transfection was carried out using siR-NA (final concentration 50 nM) diluted in 50 \u03bcL of OPTI-MEM media and 1.5 \u03bcL of the Amine reagent diluted in 47.5 \u03bcL OPTI-MEM media. Ten minutes later, the siRNA was mixed with the transfection reagent and incubated for another 10 min at room temperature (RT) for complex formation. The 100 \u03bcL siRNA-Amine complex was mixed with 900 \u03bcL regular NB41A3 media containing 1\u00d710 5 NB41A3 cells and plated into 12-well plates. Total RNA was extracted at 24 h posttransfection, and protein isolation or VSV infection was conducted 48 h posttransfection.\n\nThe plasmid containing cDNA of PIN, PGEX-4T2-PIN, was a gift from Dr. Samie Jaffrey at Weill Cornell Medical School (Jaffrey and Snyder, 1996b \n\nTo determine if there was a significant difference among the groups, mean \u00b1 SEM of each group was compared using a parametric ANOVA. The results were considered significant for a p-value less than 0.05. Pairwise comparison among the groups was done using the Tukey's post hoc test.\n\nThe constitutive ratio of PIN:NOS-1 and complexes between these proteins are affected by\n\nTo investigate if the interaction between PIN and NOS-1 was altered by IFN-\u03b3 treatment, we collected total protein from IFN-\u03b3-treated and control cells and determined the amount of PIN/ NOS-1 complexes as well as free PIN and NOS-1 by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We had earlier attempted to characterize this interaction using standard coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP), but we found that the association of PIN and NOS-1 is weak and easily disrupted (data not shown). To resolve this problem, we combined bivalent reversible cross-linking with co-IP; however, two cross-linkers aggregated too many proteins and the gels were uninterpretable (data not shown).\n\nUsing a sandwich ELISA, equal amounts of fresh cell lysates from cells treated with media or IFN-\u03b3 at different time points were added to plates precoated with the indicated capture antibody, and then incubated with primary detection and secondary antibodies for signal production (Fig. 1) . Consistent with Western blot data (Yang et al., 2006) , IFN-\u03b3 treatment resulted in a sixfold increase of total NOS-1 and 75% decrease of total PIN. A transient increase followed by a decrease of PIN/NOS-1 complexes was observed with IFN-\u03b3 treatment in neuronal cells (Fig. 1 ). This suggests that there is more free PIN than NOS-1 in NB41A3 cells.\n\nTo further characterize the involvement of PIN in the IFN-\u03b3-mediated accumulation of NOS-1 and the antiviral response, we suppressed expression of PIN by RNAi. PIN siRNA and the negative control siRNA were introduced to NB41A3 cells.\n\nOne concern we had using this technique is that RNAi may induce an IFN-\u03b2 response (Sledz et al., 2003) because of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) segments. Although reports suggested that siRNA smaller than 30 nucleotides was less likely to induce this response (Zhou et al., 2003a) , we wanted to make certain that IFN-\u03b2 production was not triggered by introduction of siRNA. We tested for expression of the IFN-\u03b2 mRNA in our samples by RT-PCR and confirmed that siRNA treatment did not induce IFN response in NB41A3 cells (Supplemental Fig. 1 , available online at www.liebertpub.com).\n\nsiRNA-transfected cells and mock-transfected cells were treated with IFN-\u03b3 for 24 h, and the suppression of PIN expression by siRNA was validated by Western blot (Fig. 2A) . Expression of NOS-1 protein and NO 2 \u2212 production were measured. Figure 2A shows that when PIN is diminished, a higher constitutive NOS-1 level is observed and IFN-\u03b3 treatment does not change the amount of NOS-1. NO production is consistent with the protein expression data (Fig. 2B ).\n\nFollowing siRNA transfection and IFN-\u03b3 treatment, we infected NB41A3 cells with VSV and examined the expression of VSV proteins by Western blot and viral replication by plaque assay. RNAi inhibition of PIN results in ~25% of the amount of M protein synthesized compared to the control, and more than 10-fold increased inhibition of release of infectious viral progeny (Fig. 3) . We interpret these data to be consistent with the decrease of PIN results in increased functional NOS-1 and decreased unstable PIN/NOS-1 complexes. As a consequence, the halflife of NOS-1 is prolonged, higher constitutive NOS-1 expression is observed, accompanied by increased NOS-1 activity, and enhanced inhibition of VSV replication results.\n\nWe overexpressed PIN in NB41A3 cells to examine its effect on IFN-\u03b3-mediated accumulation of NOS-1 and inhibition of viral replication. cDNA for PIN from PGEX-4T2-PIN (Jaffrey and Snyder, 1996a; Zhou et al., 2003b) was excised and inserted into a cytomegalovirus (CMV)driven eukaryotic expression vector PcDNA3.1/His A. The newly constructed PcDNA3.1/His A/PIN encodes cDNA with an N-terminal Xpress \u2122 tag fused to PIN. Transfected cells were visualized by antibody staining and fluorescence microscopy (Supplemental Fig. 2A , available online at www.liebertpub.com). A 50-70% transfection efficiency was achieved. Expression of Xpress-PIN mRNA was determined by RT-PCR (Supplemental Fig. 2B , available online at www.liebertpub.com).\n\nA negative control plasmid PcDNA3.1/His A/MUTA was constructed using PcDNA3.1/His A/PIN as template; mutagenesis was performed by PCR to introduce a one-nucleotide insertion within the open-reading frame of Xpress-PIN. With the frameshift on the open-reading frame, the cells transfected with PcDNA3.1/His A/MUTA did not express Xpress-PIN (Fig. 4A) .\n\nTo characterize the consequence(s) of PIN overexpression on the IFN-\u03b3-mediated anti-VSV response in the neuronal cells, NB41A3 cells were transfected with PcDNA3.1/His A/PIN or PcDNA3.1/His A/MUTA. Cell lysates were collected, and overexpression of Xpress-PIN was confirmed by co-IP of Xpress and PIN (Fig. 4A) . The interaction of Xpress-PIN and NOS-1 was determined by sandwich ELISA (Fig. 4B) . Expression of NOS-1 protein and NO 2 \u2212 production were also measured (Fig. 4C, D) . When PIN is overexpressed, we observed increases in PIN/NOS-1 complexes, lower constitutive NOS-1 expression and activity, and diminished activation of NOS-1 by IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 4) . While IFN-\u03b3 downregulates Xpress-PIN b\u1ef9 25%, in PIN overexpressing cells, there was an excess pool of endogenous PIN remaining in the cells that inhibits NOS-1 accumulation and activity as effectively as in control cells.\n\nIn a parallel experiment, neuronal cells were mock treated or IFN-\u03b3 treated for 24 h and infected with VSV. Viral proteins were detected by Western blot, and viral titer in supernatants was determined by plaque assay (Fig. 5A and B, respectively). More abundant viral proteins are produced, and increased viral replication is observed in NB41A3 cells that over-expressed PIN. IFN-\u03b3 treatment inhibits viral replication about threefold in PIN-overexpressing neuronal cells, while more than 15-fold inhibition is observed in the control IFN-\u03b3-treated cells (Fig. 5) . These data indicate that PIN is centrally involved in the IFN-\u03b3 regulation of NOS-1 activity.\n\nPosttranscriptional accumulation of NOS-1 by IFN-\u03b3 treatment appears to be critical in the inflammatory cytokine-mediated antiviral response in the neurons (Chesler et al., 2004) . The mechanism of this posttranscriptional increase in NOS-1 and enhanced viral clearance in neurons were investigated in this study. We have concentrated on the role(s) of PIN in VSV infection in the neuronal cells.\n\nFollowing IFN-\u03b3 treatment of neuronal cells, we observed a transient increase followed by a decrease of PIN/NOS-1 complexes (Fig. 1 ). This suggests that there are more free PIN than NOS-1 in the cytosol. When expression of PIN is reduced, higher constitutive NOS-1 expression levels and activity are observed ( Fig. 2 and Supplemental Fig. 1 ). In PINoverexpressing neuronal cells, we observed lower constitutive NOS-1 activity, and diminished activation of NOS-1 by IFN-\u03b3 compared with the control cells (Figs. 4 and 5, and Supplemental Fig. 2) . While the conditions we have used are not physiological, they may give insights into responses in vivo.\n\nIn the CNS, IFN-\u03b3's functions are related to the modulation of the immune system and the control of the infectious diseases. Elevated expression of IFN-\u03b3 was observed in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1)-infected brain and may play an important role in neuropathological pathways of HIV-related encephalopathy (Koedel et al., 1999; Shapshak et al., 2004) . IFN-\u03b3-producing \u03b3\u03b4T cells may help control murine West Nile virus infection (Wang et al., 2003) . The murine coronavirus, JHMV, infects a variety of CNS cell types during the acute phase of infection. In IFN-\u03b3 KO mice, increased morbidity and mortality were associated with persistent virus replication, indicating a role of the cytokine in control of viral replication (Parra et al., 1999) . These diverse viral infections illustrate the importance of IFN\u03b3 in the immune modulation and clearance of viruses from the CNS. NO-dependent antiviral activity has been found in a variety of neurotropic virus infections, including CMV (Kosugi et al., 2002) , HIV (Hori et al., 1999) , herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) (Kodukula et al., 1999) , mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (Lane et al., 1997) , poliovirus (Komatsu et al., 1996) , and reovirus (Goody et al., 2005) . Several studies have suggested possible mechanisms by which viral replication is inhibited by NO. Peroxynitrite, ONOO(\u2212), was reported to react with tyrosines, serines, and cysteines of proteins, and results in NO 2 Y, NO 2 S, and NO 2 C (Gu et al., 2002) . Such modifications could alter the activity of a viral polymerase or other viral proteins that are critically involved in virus life cycle, or affect host proteins required for virus assembly to attenuate viral infection (Simon et al., 1996; Saura et al., 1999) .\n\nPIN was reported to inhibit nNOS activity in cell lysates through disruption of enzyme dimerization (Dunbar et al., 2004) . In both in vitro and in vivo studies, dimer stabilization of NOS-1 protects the enzyme from proteolysis (Bender et al., 2000; Dunbar et al., 2004) . However, the effect of PIN on degradation and NO production of NOS-1 in the neurons has not been examined. Utilizing overexpression and siRNA, as well as the sandwich ELISA technique, we not only explore the role of PIN in the IFN-\u03b3-mediated accumulation and activation of NOS-1, but also quantitate the PIN:NOS ratio over the course of IFN-\u03b3 treatment. Our findings provide important insights into IFN-\u03b3-mediated antiviral responses in neurons.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.\n\nIFN-\u03b3 treatment does not change the amount of NOS-1 when PIN is knocked down by RNAi. siRNA of PIN or negative control siRNA (Neg, random sequence that does not target any genes) was introduced to NB41A3 cells using siPORT Amine transfection reagent. siRNAtransfected cells and mock-transfected cells were treated with IFN-\u03b3 for 24 h.
