{"title": "Feline Viral Upper Respiratory Disease", "body": "creasing evidence that Bordetella bronchiseptica is an important cause of respiratory disease in cats. Chlamydophila felis (previously Chlamydia psittaci var felis) may also cause respiratory disease, although it is predominantly associated with conjunctivitis. Other agents that have also been associated with feline respiratory disease include feline reovirus, cowpox virus, and various bacteria and mycoplasmas.\n\nFeline calicivirus is a small, nonenveloped, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Caliciviridae. This virus family contains a large number of important pathogens of man and animals including the Norwalk-like and Sapporo-like viruses (both important causes of diarrhea in man and other animals) and rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (a generally fatal disease of rabbits). However, the viruses most closely related to FCV are vesicular exanthema of swine virus (no longer isolated), San Miguel sea lion virus, and canine calicivirus (CaCV). These have been grouped together in the vesivirus genus, reflecting a general ability of viruses in this genus to induce vesicles as a prominent part of their pathology.\n\nFCV infects both domestic cats and other members of the Felidae. 1, 2 Although CaCV is genetically distinct from FCV, 3 other caliciviruses have also been detected in dogs that antigenically cross-react and genetically cluster with FCV. [3] [4] [5] This raises the possibility that dogs may be infected by FCV-like viruses, and that if they are, these viruses may be transmitted between dogs and cats. However, the significance of these canine FCV-like viruses to either dogs or cats remains largely uncertain.\n\nWhen the genetic sequences of different FCV isolates are compared with each other, they show a considerable amount of variability. This heterogeneity is often a feature of RNA viruses and is a reflection of the low accuracy or fidelity of the viral encoded polymerase. This leads to plasticity of the viral genome and the potential to generate variants at relatively rapid rates in comparison with organisms whose genetic material is based on DNA. Despite the observed variability of FCVs, comparative genetic analysis has failed to separate isolates of FCV into distinct clusters or genogroups. There appears to be no clear correlation between the sequence of a virus and either its year or location of isolation, or with the particular disease with which it is associated. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] The genetic diversity of FCV has been used to develop typing methods based largely on sequence analysis to differentiate between isolates. These methods have been used to explore the epidemiology of FCV-related disease and the role of live vaccine virus in disease in recently vaccinated animals. [11] [12] [13] This variability of the FCV genome has important implications to the antigenicity of this virus. The sequence variability has been shown to be particularly pronounced in key regions of the capsid protein that are responsible for the antigenic structure of the virus. It is therefore perhaps not surprising that most strains of FCV can be distinguished from one another on the basis of their antigenicity. However, there is sufficient cross-reactivity between FCV strains to allow them to be grouped together in a single serotype and to allow some degree of cross-protection between the majority of strains. This has important implications in relation to vaccine design.\n\nFeline herpesvirus is a member of the herpesvirus family and has a double-stranded DNA genome with a glycoprotein-lipid envelope. It is classified in the alphaherpesvirus subfamily, which contains most of the herpesviruses of veterinary interest and is very closely related genetically and antigenically to canine herpesvirus-1 and phocine (seal) herpesvirus-1. [14] [15] [16] [17] Although the domestic cat ap-pears to be the main host for FeHV, isolates have also been obtained from nondomestic felids such as cheetahs.\n\nWhen compared with the variability that is a feature of FCV, FeHV isolates are generally much more similar to one another. Slight differences between some biotypes do exist, however, with some attenuated strains used in vaccines and some apparently more virulent challenge strains. Antigenically, all isolates of FeHV are very similar and belong to one serotype. The virus also appears relatively homogenous at the genetic level although some differences between isolates have been found. [18] [19] [20] The overall homogeneity of feline herpesvirus means there is currently no easy method to study the role of individual isolates in the epidemiology of the disease.\n\nCats can be infected with FCV via the nasal, oral, or conjunctival routes. The virus replicates mainly in the oral and respiratory tissues, although some strains vary in their tissue tropism and pathogenicity. Thus some have a predilection for the lung and others have been found within macrophages in the synovial membrane of joints. 21, 22 Virus has also been found in visceral tissues; feces; and, occasionally, in urine. The significance of this in transmission is unknown but is likely to be minimal.\n\nPerhaps the most consistent pathological feature of FCV infection is oral ulceration. These ulcers begin as vesicles that subsequently rupture, with necrosis of the overlying epithelium and infiltration of neutrophils at the periphery and base. Healing generally takes place over a period of 2 to 3 weeks. Pulmonary lesions occur more rarely and appear to result from an initial focal alveolitis, leading to areas of acute exudative pneumonia and then to the development of a proliferative, interstitial pneumonia. Although primary interstitial pneumonia may occur with FCV, especially with the more virulent strains, it is possible that its importance in natural cases of disease has been overemphasized in the past. This is because many early experimental studies used aerosol challenge to infect cats, rather than the more natural oronasal route of infection. Lesions seen in FCV-infected joints consist of an acute synovitis with thickening of the synovial membrane and an increase in quantity of synovial fluid within the joint. 22\n\nAs with FCV, cats are infected with FeHV by nasal, oral, or conjunctival exposure. The virus primarily targets a number of tissues in the upper respiratory tract including the soft palate; tonsils; turbinates; conjunctivae; and, sometimes, the trachea. Virus shedding occurs as early as 24 hours after infection and generally persists for 1 to 3 weeks. Although it appears to be a rare sequel to infection, viremia has been reported, and generalized disease can be seen, particularly in young kittens or immunosuppressed individuals.\n\nInfection with FeHV leads to areas of multifocal epithelial necrosis with neutrophilic infiltration and fibrin exudation. Intranuclear inclusion bodies are present in infected cells. Replication of the virus can also lead to osteolytic changes in the turbinate bones. Acute lesions normally take between 2 and 3 weeks to resolve, although turbinate destruction may be permanent and may predispose affected cats to chronic rhinitis. Primary lung involvement may occur but as with FCV infection, is rare. Although disease is not dependent on the presence of other organisms, secondary bacterial infection can enhance the pathology leading to bacterial pneumonia and sinusitis.\n\nThe clinical signs following infection with FCV or FeHV depend on a number of factors including those associated with the agent (e.g., strain and infecting dose), and those associated with the host (e.g., general health, age, and genetic make-up). Differences in microbial flora, in husbandry conditions, and the presence of any preexisting immunity may also affect the course of infection. Concurrent infections with immunosuppressive viruses such as feline immunodeficiency virus and feline leukemia virus may lead to more severe disease. [23] [24] [25] \n\nFollowing a short incubation period of 2 to 5 days, early signs of infection with most strains of FCV include depression and pyrexia. Affected cats generally appear brighter than those infected with FeHV. Perhaps the most characteristic clinical sign associated with FCV infection is ulceration of the tongue (Figure 35-1) . Ulcers may also occasionally be seen on the lips or the nose. Cats with ulcerated mouths may show excessive salivation with wetness around the mouth. However, affected cats often show few other clinical signs, and it is likely that many cases in which oral ulceration is the main or only clinical sign go unrecognized. Sneezing, conjunctivitis, and ocular and nasal discharges typically occur but are usually less prominent than following FeHV infection. In most typical cases, clinical signs resolve over 7 to 10 days.\n\nAs well as this typically mild oral and respiratory disease, a wide range of other clinical presentations may also be observed following FCV infection. This pathogenic variability is again likely to be a reflection of the genetic variability of this virus. Therefore, although most strains induce fairly mild disease, some appear to be nonpathogenic, whereas others are capable of inducing more severe disease.\n\nSkin ulceration on other parts of the body may be seen but occurs rarely and is generally mild. Some of the more virulent strains of FCV may cause pneumonia with associated dyspnea, particularly in younger animals when the disease becomes much more serious. FCV has also been reported in occasional cases of abortion. 26, 27 An acute lameness and pyrexia syndrome has also been described following FCV infection; it may or may not be associated with respiratory disease. 22, 28, 29 The lameness is usually described as shifting, affecting more than one leg, and is often accompanied by pyrexia. Affected cats are often dull and anorexic. Most cases recover within 1 to 2 days, and there are no known longterm effects on the joints. It is likely that such cases of lameness and the more typical cases associated with respiratory disease are not entirely distinct clinical entities. Instead, it has been suggested that most \"limping\" strains of FCV may cause some degree of respiratory disease, and vice versa. 29 Lameness associated with FCV infection has also been seen after vaccination. [30] [31] [32] Sequence analysis of virus isolated from affected cats has shown that in most cases, the lameness appears to be caused by coincidental infection with field virus in young kittens as they lose their maternally-derived antibody. However, in some cases, virus originating from live vaccines appears to be involved. 11, 12 A potential worrying clinical development in the repertoire of FCV induced disease has recently been reported in the United States. In 1998, the first of several outbreaks of disease was described in which affected cats presented variably with facial and paw edema (50%), pyrexia (90%), upper respiratory tract infection (50%), icterus (20%), and hemorrhage from the nose and in the feces (30% to 40%). 9 Necrosis with ulceration was also seen in areas of earlier edema. The mortality rate associated with infection often reached 50%, with both kittens and adults succumbing to infection. Necropsy findings included pneumonia (80%), hepatomegaly (50%), pancreatitis (10%), and pericarditis (10%). The disease has been recreated experimentally by infection with FCV isolated from affected cats, further confirming the role of FCV in this serious disease. The variability of FCV means we should perhaps not be surprised by the occasional new and distinct manifestation of clinical disease. To date, most of these outbreaks have been relatively well controlled with strict quarantine and disinfection.\n\nThe chronic oral disease lymphoplasmacytic gingivitis stomatitis complex (LPGS) has also been associated with FCV infection. In some studies, approximately 80% of cats with LPGS have been shedding FCV, compared with 20% of controls. 33, 34 However, these shedding rates may depend on the criteria used for the selection of clinical cases. 35 Chronic stomatitis developed following the accidental introduction of FCV into one cat colony, further suggesting a role for FCV in this disease. 36 However, chronic oral disease has not been reproduced experimentally in cats, 23, [37] [38] [39] and attempts to identify consistent differences between FCV isolates from cats with LPGS and those from cats with other FCV-associated diseases have so far been unsuccessful. 6, 7, 39 It is therefore likely that factors not associated with FCV, including other pathogens and host factors, may also play a role in this complex and serious syndrome.\n\nThere has also been some debate about the role of FCV in feline urinary tract disease. Although virus can be visualized in and isolated from urine, there are currently no studies demonstrating a clear association between infection and disease. 8\n\nFeHV infection generally causes more consistent and severe upper respiratory and conjunctival disease than FCV, particularly in younger susceptible animals. The incubation period is usually 2 to 6 days but may vary depending on the challenge dose, with a higher dose inducing more rapid and severe clinical signs.\n\nInitially, infected cats develop depression, marked sneezing, inappetence, pyrexia, and serous ocular and nasal discharges (Figure 35 -2). In the earlier stages of infection, cats may also show excessive salivation and ptyalism (drooling of saliva). Conjunctivitis typically develops, and the ocular and nasal discharges change from serous to mucopurulent. In severe cases, dyspnea and coughing may also occur. Although oral ulceration can occur with FeHV infection, it is relatively rare compared with that following FCV infection. Occasionally, primary viral pneumonia or generalized disease may occur, particularly in young or debilitated animals. Other manifestations of infection include ocular disease such as ulcerative or interstitial keratitis and a possible association with uveitis. 40 Improved diagnosis (e.g., using the polymerase chain reaction) has led to greater recognition of such conditions. [41] [42] [43] Skin ulcers and dermatitis syndrome in domestic cats and cheetahs, [44] [45] [46] and neurological signs have also been reported, but these are likely to be rare sequels to FeHV infection.\n\nUnlike many other alphaherpesviruses (e.g., canine herpesvirus-1), FeHV does not appear to have a significant role in reproductive tract disease. Experimental studies have suggested that abortion, when it occasionally occurs, is caused by the severe systemic nature of the illness rather than being a direct effect of the virus itself. Indeed, in an investigation of a natural outbreak of FeHV in specific pathogen-free cats, no cases of abortion were seen, even in severely affected pregnant queens. 47 As with classic FCV infection, the mortality rate with FeHV infection is generally low. In very young kittens or immunosuppressed cats, the mortality rate may be higher because of secondary bacterial infections and, more rarely, generalized viral infection. Clinical signs generally resolve over a period of 2 to 3 weeks. However, in some animals, permanent damage of the mucosa and turbinates may occur, leaving affected cats prone to chronic upper respiratory bacterial infections of the nose, paranasal sinuses, and conjunctiva.\n\nIn many individual cases, it may not be necessary to determine the precise cause of infectious upper respiratory tract disease. However, there are some circumstances where a diagnosis is advisable. These include outbreaks of disease in colonies, where specific control measures may be required; and disease in vaccinated cats, where questions may arise concerning the safety and efficacy of a vaccine.\n\nWhereas many of the clinical signs that occur in viral upper respiratory disease are common to both FCV and FeHV infection, a presumptive diagnosis in some cases may be possible based on clinical signs alone. FCV tends to cause a relatively mild disease in which oral ulceration is a relatively consistent feature. Lameness, if present, particularly in young kittens, is also suggestive of FCV infection. In contrast, FeHV tends to cause a more consistent and severe disease than FCV, associated with copious ocular and nasal discharges and sneezing.\n\nLaboratory diagnosis is necessary where a definitive diagnosis is required. For both viruses, this has classically involved virus isolation in feline cell cultures. A plain oropharyngeal swab is taken from the cat and placed into suitable viral transport medium, then sent within 24 hours to an appropriate laboratory. For viral culture, results may take up to 2 weeks to confirm, particularly if the result is that no virus is isolated. Serology is generally not helpful for the diagnosis of acute FCV or FeHV infection because of widespread immunity from vaccination or earlier infection. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is also increasingly being used for the diagnosis of FeHV. [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] PCR and sequencing has also been used to distinguish between FCV isolates, where it has been particularly useful in the investigation of vaccine failures 11, 12 and in dissecting the epidemiology of the disease. 54, 55 The inherent variability of FCV strains has meant that the development of PCRs with high enough sensitivity to be used for the routine diagnosis of all FCV strains has been very problematic. Whereas some PCRs may show a high sensitivity with some strains, the sensitivity is likely to be lower with others, in some cases leading to false negative results. Recently, a real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR that targets relatively conserved regions of the virus genome has been described. 56 This method has been shown to be able to successfully amplify a broad range of FCV strains detecting 100% of 60 laboratory strains tested.\n\nWhen diagnosing acute disease, results of virus isolation must be interpreted with care. False positives may occur because of the presence of clinically normal carriers in the population. False negatives may also occur particularly when only low levels of the infecting organism are shed, such as may occur in the later stages of acute disease. Other infections, particularly Bordetella bronchiseptica and Chlamydophila felis, may also be associated with upper respiratory tract disease in the cat, and therefore it may be appropriate to include testing for these as part of a diagnostic work-up.\n\nCurrently no antiviral drugs are in widespread use for the treatment of FeHV or FCV. Drugs such as acyclovir, given in human herpesvirus infection, do not seem to have good activity against FeHV. 57, 58 However, antiviral treatments are available for topical use in cases of ulcerative keratitis associated with FeHV infection. 43 Interferon has been suggested to be useful for treatment of acute viral infections. Some have advocated the use of human interferon orally, but the rationale for this is unclear because the majority of orally administered interferon may be expected to be degraded in the stomach. Recently, a commercial recombinant feline interferon has been licensed for parenteral administration in some countries, including the United Kingdom. However, there is currently little documented evidence for its success in the treatment of feline upper respiratory infections.\n\nBroad-spectrum antibiotic treatment is generally recommended in cases of viral respiratory disease to minimize potential complications associated with secondary bacterial infection. Because swallowing may be painful, antibiotics can be given either as syrups (if available) or parenterally. In severe cases, bacterial culture and sensitivity testing may be required. Good nursing care, with regular cleansing of discharges, is essential. The cat should be encouraged to eat by offering strongly flavored, aromatic foods. If eating is painful, liquidized or specialized proprietary foods may be of some help. In some cases, the use of appetite stimulants such as diazepam or cyproheptadine may also be of some benefit. Some severely affected cases may require fluid therapy, and where anorexia is prolonged, a nasogastric esophagostomy or gastrostomy tube may be indicated. 59 In cases of chronic rhinitis, mucolytic drugs such as bromhexine hydrochloride may help clear mucus from airways. However, conventional steam inhalation (e.g., placing the cat in a steamy room) is probably of as much use.\n\nIn the past, both FCV and FeHV were isolated from approximately equal numbers of cats with respiratory disease. Recently, however, FCV appears to be isolated more commonly. [60] [61] [62] This may be because of the antigenic diversity of FCV isolates compared with the single serotype of FeHV, which may affect the relative efficacy of the two vaccines. Both viruses remain fairly widespread in the general cat population, with an increased prevalence when cats are kept together. The viruses circulate and maintain themselves in the cat population in one of three ways. Firstly, there may be direct transmission of virus from acutely infected cats. Clearly, for the virus to persist in this way, there must be a sufficient number of susceptible animals within the population and opportunities for contact between them. Secondly, because FCV (and, to a lesser extent FeHV) can remain infectious for relatively short periods outside a host, viral contamination of the environment may lead to fomite transmission. This is particularly relevant within the close confines of a cattery or hospital, where secretions may contaminate cages, feeding and cleaning utensils, or personnel. 63 Finally, for both FCV and FeHV, animals that recover from acute disease may remain infected and develop persistent infections. Despite vaccination, such carriers are common in the population and are probably the main reason why these viruses remain so widespread.\n\nThere are no known reservoir or alternative hosts for FeHV, and in utero transmission does not generally seem to occur. The role of dogs in maintaining FCV in the population is not known, although as stated previously, FCVlike viruses have occasionally been recovered from dogs.\n\nFollowing acute infection with FCV, clinical signs generally resolve in 7 to 10 days. However, most cats still shed FCV in oropharyngeal secretions for 30 days after infection, and such cats are defined as carriers (Figure 35-3) . Subsequently, experimental studies have suggested that there is an exponential decline in the proportion of animals remaining infected, with approximately 50% of the cats still shedding virus 75 days later. 64 Although this most likely represents an over-simplification of the true dynamics of the FCV carrier state, it is a useful guide.\n\nIndividual FCV carriers may shed virus for life, but most cats appear to spontaneously eliminate the virus. The mechanism by which some cats clear infection is not known. However, it is likely that in the field, reinfection is common. Concurrent infections with other pathogens may impact on the dynamics of the FCV carrier state. For example, there is some evidence that preexisting FIV infection may potentiate FCV shedding either in terms of the duration of shedding, 23 or the titer of virus shed. 25 FCV carriers shed virus more-or-less continuously. Individual cats seem to vary in the quantity of virus they shed, 65 and it is likely that those animals that shed the higher amounts of virus will transmit infection most readily. In contrast, low-level shedders are probably not as infectious and may also be more difficult to detect because the level of virus shed may intermittently fall below the sensitivity of virus diagnosis. Therefore when trying to detect FCV carriers, it is advisable to take a series of swabs over several weeks before an individual is believed to be FCV negative.\n\nThe mechanism of persistence for FCV is not fully elucidated. Viruses recovered from carrier cats have been shown to change antigenically over time. 66, 67 This antigenic evolution correlates with sequence changes in key antigenic domains of the virus capsid, and has led to the suggestion that antigenic variants generated within carriers allow FCV to escape neutralization by the cat's im-mune response. 67,68 Such a process is common among RNA viruses that cause persistent infections and is associated with the low accuracy of virally-encoded RNA polymerases.\n\nDespite the use of vaccines for approximately 30 years, the prevalence of FCV infection in the general cat population remains high. Before vaccines were introduced in the 1970s, surveys showed that approximately 8% of household pets, 25% of cats attending cat shows, and 40% of colony cats were shedding the virus. 69 However, in recent years, approximately 20% to 25% of cats in a variety of husbandry situations still shed FCV. 60, 61, 70 In one rescue shelter, FCV prevalence was approximately 25% despite the regular use of vaccination to control clinical disease. 55 Molecular epidemiology studies showed that within this particular shelter, most isolates were distinct, unless the isolates were obtained from cats that were housed in the same pen. This suggests that the high prevalence within the rescue shelter was because of the high prevalence of FCV in cats arriving at the shelter rather than significant transmission within the shelter. In contrast, a single viral strain often seems to predominate in household colonies with a high prevalence of infection, although evolution of the individual colony isolates may occur over time. 71 Molecular studies should enable a clearer understanding of the epidemiology of FCV and the role of the carrier state in the continued high prevalence of this virus. Preexisting immunity, acquired either naturally as maternally derived antibody or artificially following parenteral vaccination, does not prevent infection with FCV. Animals may become carriers following subclinical infection with field virus, thereby maintaining infection in the population (see Figure 35 -3). There is no evidence that vaccination will cure an existing carrier state.\n\nAs with other alphaherpesviruses, cats become latently infected with FeHV following acute disease (Figure 35-4) . During latency, no infectious virus is detectable; however, periodical episodes of virus reactivation occur, during which times infectious virus is present in oronasal and ocular secretions. In some cases, carriers show mild clinical signs while they are shedding (recrudescence) which may act as a useful indicator that such individuals are likely to be infectious to other cats.\n\nAlthough latently infected carriers all have the potential to shed FeHV, some cats appear to do so more frequently, and as such are likely to be of greater epidemiological significance. Reactivation may occur spontaneously but is most likely to occur following a stress (e.g., after parturition) or a change of housing (e.g., going into a boarding cattery, to a cat show, or to stud). 72 Shedding does not occur immediately after stress: there is a lag period of approximately 1 week, followed by a shedding episode of up to 2 weeks. Thus carrier cats are most likely to be infectious from 1 to 3 weeks following a stress (see Figure  35 -4). Corticosteroid treatment can also induce shedding, and care should be taken when using these drugs in carriers because some of these cats may develop severe recrudescent disease.\n\nAs with some other herpesvirus infections, FeHV remains latent in carriers in trigeminal ganglia, although there is evidence to show that other tissues may also be involved. 51, 73, 74 Latency is almost certainly lifelong, but there is a refractory phase of several months after a period of shedding when animals are less likely to experience another episode.\n\nThe importance of latent FeHV carriers lies in their ability to transmit infection. Therefore any animal with a history of FeHV-associated respiratory disease, or with persistent or recurrent signs, should be considered potentially infectious. Similarly any queen who repeatedly produces litters that develop respiratory disease is probably a carrier and it may be advisable not to use such queens for breeding.\n\nAs with FCV, immunity to FeHV, whether vaccine-induced or maternally-derived, does not prevent infection, and cats may become carriers even though they have no history of clinical disease (see Figure 35 -4). In latently infected queens, virus shedding that may be induced by the stress of parturition and lactation provides a source of infectious virus to kittens. Such a mechanism favors virus spread to the next generation without harming its host. In the case of vaccination, there is no evidence that vaccination will eliminate an existing latent infection, although it is theoretically possible that it may reduce episodes of virus shedding.\n\nFCV and FeHV are shed mainly in oral, nasal, and conjunctival secretions in both acutely infected and carrier cats. Transmission mostly occurs by direct contact between cats, but indirect transmission may occur. Thus cats may also be infected through contact with contaminated secretions on cages, feed bowls, cleaning utensils, and personnel. 63 However, because both viruses are relatively short-lived outside the cat, the environment is not usually a long-term source of infection. Unlike many respiratory pathogens in other species, true aerosol transmission is not thought to be of major importance for the spread of feline respiratory viruses. This is thought to reflect the small tidal volume of the cat such that infectious aerosols are not generally produced during normal respiration. However, macrodroplets produced by sneezing may travel over a distance of 1 to 2 meters, allowing virus transmission to occur.\n\nTransmission is most successful in overcrowded conditions where cats are more likely to have prolonged, close contact. Poor ventilation and hygiene may also lead to a build up of pathogens in the environment. Transmission is thought to be more easily achieved from acutely infected cats rather than carriers, as discharges are more copious and the amount of virus higher. However, carriers are undoubtedly important sources of virus, particularly in transmission between queens and kittens, and in the close contact seen between cats in multi-cat colonies.\n\nMost cats develop some degree of immunity to FCV following natural infection; however, it may not always be complete or of long duration. In addition, the many different strains of FCV show varying degrees of crossprotection. Immunity following the use of modified live or inactivated vaccines is similarly incomplete, though this may depend on the strains or challenge system used. [75] [76] [77] [78] After vaccination, protection against FCV disease has been reported to last for 10 to 12 months. 79 More recent work has suggested that partial protection may last considerably longer. Moderate levels of virus neutralizing antibody have been shown to persist in a group of vaccinated cats for at least 4 years, although after 7.5 years, titers had declined to low or nondetectable levels. 80, 81 Protection against FCV challenge decreased from 85% at 3 weeks after vaccination to 63% after 7.5 years.\n\nVirus-neutralizing antibody levels to FCV tend to be higher than with FeHV, and in general there is reasonable correlation with protection against disease. 82 However, protection has also been seen with lower levels of virus neutralizing antibody, suggesting cell-mediated and possible local immunity may also play a role. 38, 76, 83 Following primary infection with FeHV, most cats are generally resistant to subsequent reinfection. However, protection is not necessarily complete in all animals and may only be of relatively short duration. By 6 months after infection, cats may only be partially protected from subsequent challenge, and carrier cats may also develop recrudescent disease. Low levels of virus neutralizing antibody develop following initial infection or vaccination, suggesting that, as for other alphaherpesviruses, cell-mediated and local immunity play a significant role in protection. However, after reactivation or field virus challenge, virus-neutralizing antibody titers generally rise to more moderate levels and thereafter remain reasonably stable, independent of virus shedding episodes.\n\nMost cats are protected following the use of modified live or inactivated FeHV vaccines. Again, however, immunity is not necessarily complete in all animals, even if challenge takes place within 3 months of vaccination. 78, 84, 85 Similar levels of protection have been reported after a year. 86 More recent studies have shown that the relative efficacy of an inactivated vaccine decreased from 83% shortly after primary vaccination to 52% after 7.5 years. 81 In kittens, maternally derived antibody (which is essentially colostral) may persist for 10 to 14 weeks and 2 to 10 weeks for FCV and FeHV, respectively. 87, 88 However, for both viruses, low levels of maternally derived antibody do not necessarily protect against subclinical infection, and kittens infected at this time may become carriers without showing clinical disease (see Figures  35-3 and 35-4) .\n\nA number of vaccines against FCV and FeHV are available, and have been used relatively successfully for many years. Nevertheless, because of the epidemiology of the disease, respiratory disease may still occur, particularly where cats are housed together in breeding, boarding, or rescue catteries. Therefore, prevention and control is best achieved by a combination of vaccination and cattery management.\n\nThe majority of vaccines marketed against FCV and FeHV are either live and attenuated or inactivated and adjuvanted, and are licensed for parenteral administration. Modified live intranasal vaccines are also marketed in some countries, including the United States.\n\nMost vaccines induce reasonable protection against disease. However, it is worth restating that vaccination does not, in general, protect against infection and the development of the carrier state of either FCV or FeHV. Therefore, vaccinated animals may be subsequently infected with field viruses and develop persistent infections without clinical disease. Such vaccinated, field virus carriers are important sources of infection to other na\u00efve cats and are likely to be partly responsible for the continued high prevalence of FCV and FeHV in the general cat population.\n\nThe differences in relative efficacy of FCV and FeHV vaccines are partly explained by the different level of strain variation shown by each of these viruses. For FeHV, there is only one serotype, and it is likely that vaccines protect equally against all field isolates. In contrast, the antigenic differences between FCV isolates mean that no single vaccine strain is likely to protect equally against all field viruses. The strains of FCV chosen for use in vaccines, such as F9 and more recently 255, have largely been selected on the basis of being broadly cross-reactive in virus neutralization tests in cell culture. 31, 76, 89 Recently, companies have sought market advantage through claims of broader cross-reactivity for their vaccine strains. Indeed, the ability of a company's vaccine to neutralize a high proportion of field isolates will probably play an increasingly important role in vaccine marketing. However, it is likely that strains of FCV will always exist that show limited neutralization by individual vaccines. It is also possible that the widespread use of vaccines may select for these \"vaccine-resistant\" strains. 76, 89 In the authors' opinion it would be desirable, therefore, for the efficacy of commercially available vaccines to be regularly monitored against panels of contemporary field viruses. However, this is not currently routinely performed.\n\nDespite designing vaccines to be broadly crossreactive, the antigenic diversity of FCV means that in some groups of cats, FCV-related disease may still occur despite regular vaccination. In this situation, it may be appropriate to consider changing vaccines to one based on a different strain. However, vaccine changes should be approached with care because any new vaccine may show either increased or reduced protection against the predominant colony virus. Any decision to change vaccine may be informed by determining the neutralization profile of vaccine-induced antisera against the predominant colony virus. However, this test is only available at specialist laboratories, is expensive and time-consuming, and can be difficult to interpret. Rational choice of vaccines also requires information on the strains of FCV used in vaccines; however, this information is not often included in data sheet information for marketed vaccines.\n\nAlthough live parenteral vaccines are generally considered to be safe, clinical signs have been reported following their use, particularly in young kittens after their first vaccination (Box 35-1). 30, 32 Clinical signs may be induced if the vaccine reaches the oral or respiratory mucosa (e.g., if the cat or a littermate licks the injection site, or if an aerosol is made at the time of injection). In addition, in rare cases, vaccine virus may be able to generalize to the oropharynx even if it is correctly administered. 21, 76 For FCV, molecular typing has confirmed that the majority of vaccine reactions are associated with field virus infection. 11, 12 However, in some cases, vaccine virus does seem to be involved. It is interesting to speculate what happens to such vaccine viruses once individual cats start shedding them. Vaccine safety studies required before live vaccines are marketed would suggest they are unlikely to spread and persist in the population and, until recently, \n\n\u2022 Vaccine virus gains access to the respiratory mucosa from modified live systemic vaccines through incorrect administration (e.g., aerosolization, licking the injection site). vaccine-type viruses have only been identified in recently vaccinated cats. More recently, however, FCV isolates closely related to those used in live vaccines have been found in the general cat population, raising the possibility that, in rare cases, vaccine virus may persist in individual cat populations, possibly causing disease. 9, 10, 54 In contrast to live vaccines, inactivated vaccines have the advantage of not being able to spread or revert to virulence, and are therefore particularly useful in virus-free colonies. Some inactivated vaccines have also been used during pregnancy in queens as a useful control measure aimed at prolonging the persistence of maternally derived antibody in kittens 90 ; however, individual data sheets should be checked for this indication. Although inactivated vaccines are classically considered less efficacious than live vaccines, modern adjuvants have led to improvements in immunogenicity. Indeed, a long duration of immunity and reasonable levels of protection in most cats has recently been shown for an adjuvanted, inactivated FCV and FeHV vaccine. 80, 81 Adjuvants may, however, cause clinical problems following vaccination in some individual cats. Both local injection site reactions and systemic reactions including pyrexia and lethargy have been observed. Most of these signs are transient, but local reactions may persist for several weeks. In recent years it has become apparent that in rare cases such reactions may progress to sarcomas. 91 Although adjuvants, particularly those based on aluminum, have been implicated in the etiology of vaccine-associated sarcomas, their precise role in the process remains unclear.\n\nLive intranasal vaccines induce local mucosal immunity, and this is probably more effective than immunity induced by parenteral vaccines. However, because the virus replicates at the site of inoculation, clinical signs such as mild sneezing may be seen after several days in some individuals. Data sheets often state that oral lesions may also be observed following the use of intranasal vaccines, and that these tend to heal rapidly. Intranasal vaccines are particularly useful when a rapid onset of protection is required (e.g., for a cat going into a boarding cattery or in the face of an outbreak of disease). In contrast to parenteral vaccines, only a single dose of intranasal vaccine is generally required to induce immunity following primary vaccination. Complete protection has been shown 4 days after intranasal vaccination and partial protection after 2 days. These vaccines may also overcome maternally derived antibody better than parenteral vaccines, although in general their use is only licensed in kittens from 12 weeks of age. Live intranasal vaccines have shown an increase in popularity among some veterinarians, in part because of public concerns about the role of inactivated vaccines in vaccine-associated sarcomas. At the time of writing, no intranasal vaccines are marketed in the United Kingdom.\n\nBoosters for FCV and FeHV vaccines are traditionally recommended every year. However, concerns about vaccine site reactions have led to the suggestion that, in some circumstances, vaccination frequency may be reduced based on an informed risk assessment of the likelihood of infection in each individual case. [92] [93] [94] \n\nThe methods used to control disease caused by FCV and FeHV vary somewhat depending on the husbandry situation in which the cat is housed. In most cases, routine vaccination for FCV and FeHV is recommended unless there are strong indications that the risk of infection is negligible. Disinfection is also an important mainstay of control. Because of its lipid envelope, FeHV is highly susceptible to the effects of all common disinfectants. In contrast, FCV shows some degree of resistance to certain disinfectants. Both viruses, however, are inactivated by a number of proprietary products.\n\nHousehold pets are most likely to be exposed to respiratory pathogens when entering a high-risk situation such as a boarding cattery or a veterinary hospital. Although transmission may also occur between cats within a neighborhood, the extent to which this occurs will depend on the level and opportunities for contact between them. Cats are mainly territorial animals and with neutered animals, once their territory is established, any contact with other cats is usually brief and does not encourage extensive transmission of pathogens. In addition, FCV and FeHV are relatively fragile outside their hosts, reducing the impact of indirect transmission. Therefore in order to reduce the risk of respiratory disease, individual cats should be routinely vaccinated and should avoid stress and social contact as far as possible.\n\nBoarding catteries may be associated with high levels of virus challenge because of the large numbers of cats, the high prevalence of FCV and FeHV carriers, and reactivation of FeHV shedding induced by stress. Therefore all cats admitted to a boarding cattery should have an up-to-date vaccination record for both FCV and FeHV. This means that young kittens should have completed the full vaccination course, and adult cats should have had their annual booster, at least 7 days before admission. Where the booster vaccination interval has lapsed to 18 months, it might be advisable to revaccinate. In situations where rapid protection is required, intranasal vaccination may be used if available. However, clients should be aware that such vaccines themselves may induce mild clinical signs. Although vaccination is helpful in controlling disease, the owners of catteries should not rely on it solely for disease control. Indeed, even fully vaccinated animals may succumb to disease if the viral challenge is high enough. Precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of transmission within the cattery and to reduce the concentration of respiratory pathogens in the environment (Box 35-2).\n\nShelter facilities should apply the same measures as boarding catteries. However, it is often impossible to guarantee levels of vaccination before admission, and it may also be impossible to separate cats to the same extent. As far as possible, individual cats should be segregated or batched and quarantined, and those with clinical signs isolated. Unless animals can be quarantined on arrival for 3 to 4 weeks, systemic vaccines may not have time to become effective. In these circumstances it may be advisable to use intranasal vaccines if available.\n\nIn disease-free breeding catteries, cats should be vaccinated routinely if there is any contact at all with other cats, and in these situations, inactivated vaccines may be preferable. Great care should be taken to avoid bringing respiratory pathogens into the colony: any cat with a history of respiratory disease, or from a household with a history of respiratory disease, may be a carrier. It should be remembered that cats may become infected subclinically under cover of maternally derived antibody or vaccine-induced immunity. The greatest risk of infection to disease-free households is likely to be from stud cats and new breeding stock, where exposure is prolonged. Where possible, these cats should come from colonies free of respiratory disease. There is also a slight risk of infection from cat shows, where approximately 25% of cats are shedding FCV. 70 However, direct contact between cats at shows is limited and hygiene measures are usually good. Cats entering the colony should be quarantined for 3 weeks to identify animals incubating disease. During quarantine, oropharyngeal swabs should be taken for viral diagnosis at least twice a week in order to have the best chance of detecting carriers. Even so, there is still the risk of importing both latent FeHV carriers or lowlevel FCV carriers. The necessity to screen for other infectious causes of respiratory disease such as B. bronchiseptica and C. felis may also be considered.\n\nIn breeding colonies with endemic disease, attempts to control disease can be made by taking the following measures:\n\n\u2022 Provide regular vaccination against FCV and FeHV.\n\n\u2022 Give booster vaccinations to queens either before mating or during pregnancy to boost levels of ma-ternally derived antibody in kittens. (If the latter, use an inactivated vaccine, and only if it has a data sheet supporting such use.) \u2022 Avoid the use of particular queens with a history of respiratory disease in their kittens. \u2022 Minimize stressful situations and employ good management practices. \u2022 Move queens into isolation at least 3 weeks before term so that the kittens are not exposed to carriers in the colony, and so that any FeHV shedding episode from the queen induced by the move will be over before parturition. \u2022 Wean kittens early into isolation as soon as it is feasible (ideally at 4 to 5 weeks) if it is likely the queen is a carrier. \u2022 Vaccinate all kittens as soon as maternally derived antibody is at a noninterfering level (normally 9\u03e9 weeks) and keep them in strict isolation until a week after the second dose (normally at 12 weeks). \u2022 Use earlier vaccination schedules: a recent field study has shown that kittens may respond to parenteral vaccination against FCV and FeHV given at 3-week intervals from 6 weeks of age. 95 Intranasal vaccines have also been advocated 7 to 10 days before disease normally occurs in a colony, and then again at 12 weeks of age. However, it should be kept in mind that such vaccines are not generally licensed for this use. \u2022 In some circumstances it may be feasible to restock the colony with virus-free cats and to employ a barrier system to keep the viruses out. A commercial or institutional colony could achieve this using specific \n\n\u2022 Make sure all incoming cats are fully vaccinated.\n\n\u2022 Keep cats separate unless they are from the same household. \u2022 Build catteries with solid partitions between pens.\n\nEnsure frontages are at least 1 meter apart and the surface of the pen is made of nonporous material that is easily washable. \u2022 Arrange the pen so the food and water bowls and the litter tray are easily accessible without having to enter the pen. \u2022 Either wash hands in disinfectant between visiting each pen, or have a set of disposable gloves on a peg by each pen. Dedicate gloves for use in that pen only; dispose of or thoroughly disinfect them before use with a new boarder. \u2022 Wear rubber boots, and if it is necessary to enter the pen, step into a disinfectant bath before and after entering. \u2022 Either use disposable food trays or have two sets of feed bowls used on alternate days. Soak the used set in a recommended disinfectant for several hours, thoroughly rinse, and leave to dry until next use.\n\n\u2022 Prepare food in a central area.\n\n\u2022 If necessary to replace a badly soiled litter tray, follow a similar system to the feed bowls. \u2022 Between residents, thoroughly disinfect the pen; allow to dry; and, preferably, leave empty for 2 days before reusing. \u2022 Put those cats that have signs of respiratory disease, or are known to have had respiratory disease, or are suspected from previous experience of being carriers, in a separate section or at one end of the cattery, and feed/clean last. \u2022 Feed cats in the same order every day, and attend to each pen completely before moving to the next. \u2022 Reduce concentration of infectious diseases in the environment by adequate ventilation, low relative humidity, and optimal environmental temperature. \u2022 In mixed boarding catteries and kennels, be aware of possible transmission of Bordetella bronchiseptica between cats and dogs. Disinfect between areas, use separate staff if possible, and avoid visiting coughing dogs before cats (or coughing cats before dogs).\n\npathogen-free animals. A pedigree cat breeding unit could hand-rear kittens of existing stock in isolation, bearing in mind that the viruses are very widespread and that it might be difficult to ensure that the colony remains virus free, even with vaccination."}
