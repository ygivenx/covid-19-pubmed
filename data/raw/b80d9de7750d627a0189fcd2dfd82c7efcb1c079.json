{"title": "An interaction network of RNA-binding proteins involved in Drosophila oogenesis Running title: Interactome of RNA Binding Proteins from Drosophila ovaries", "body": "The post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression requires several trans-acting factors that regulate the life cycle of an mRNA (1) . Many of these factors are RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that interact with the maturing mRNAs to form functional messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes (mRNPs), interconnecting various steps of RNA metabolism, thereby controlling gene expression (1) (2) (3) . In Drosophila oogenesis, mRNPs are first assembled in the nurse cell nucleus, providing a platform for the formation of larger dynamic assemblies in the cytoplasm, regulating mRNA transport, silencing and localized translation. Several RBPs have been identified and extensively studied in Drosophila development. Some of the well characterized and evolutionary conserved examples include the dsRNA-binding protein Staufen (Stau) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) , the DEAD-box helicases Vasa (Vas) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) and eIF4AIII (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) , the CCHC-type zinc finger protein Nanos (Nos) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) and the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) Hrp48 and Glorund (Glo) (31-33). Binding of these proteins is essential for the proper expression of four key maternal transcripts: bicoid (bcd), oskar (osk), gurken (grk) and nanos (nos), critical to define the future embryonic axes. In addition to their functions in establishing oocyte polarity, these RBPs have various other roles during Drosophila oogenesis. For example, Hrp48 and Glo are required in nurse cells for the regulation of chromosome organization (38, 47). They have also been implicated as regulators of alternative splicing,\n\nOvaries from well-fed flies were dissected in PBS and stored at -80 \u00baC. For immunoprecipitation, frozen ovaries were thawed on ice in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 at 4 \u00baC, 100 mM NaCl, 250 mM Sucrose, 0.1% NP-40 and 1 mM DTT) and pooled together in required numbers (see Table S2 ). Ovaries were mechanically homogenized in lysis buffer (320 \u00b5l/ 40 flies), supplemented with protease inhibitors (cOmplete\u2122, EDTA-free Protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche), using tissue homogenizer with a glass pestle.\n\nLysates were cleared by centrifugation at 21,000g for 20 min at 4 \u00baC and 5 \u00b5l/ml of RNase A/T1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to the supernatants. After incubation at 4 \u00baC for 30 min, lysates were cleared again and 30-60 \u00b5l of GFP-TRAP MA beads (Chromotek) were added. The mixtures were incubated for 1 hour at 4 \u00baC in rotation. Beads were washed with lysis buffer and proteins were eluted as described above.\n\nEluates were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane.\n\nMembranes were blocked in PBS containing 5% milk powder and 0.1% Tween-20. HA-tagged, HA-Flagtagged and GFP-tagged proteins were detected using HRP-conjugated monoclonal anti-HA (1:5000, BioLegend #901501) or polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies (1:2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific #A11122) respectively. Blots were developed with ECL (GE healthcare) reagents, as recommended by the manufacturer, and imaged using an Amersham Imager 600 (GE healthcare).\n\nFor analysis of proteins interacting with each tagged RBP, both label-free and dimethyl labeling MS experiments were performed and raw data was processed by MaxQuant software as described below.\n\nProteome data comprised a total of 21 raw files (3 biological replicates from each sample) for label-free MS and 2 raw files (2 biological replicates from each sample) for dimethyl labeling MS. Tag alone was used as a negative control for both analyses.\n\nFor proteome measurements, eluates were separated on a NuPAGE Bis-Tris precast 4-12% gradient gel (Invitrogen). Samples were run approximately 2 cm into the gel and bands were visualized with a 0.1% Colloidal Coomassie Blue stain (Serva). Proteins were digested in-gel using trypsin. Peptides were desalted .

LC-MS analysis were performed on a nanoLC (Easy-nLC 1200, Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) through a nanoelectrospray ion source (Thermo Fisher Scientific), as described previously (69) . In brief, peptides were eluted using a segmented gradient of 10%-50% HPLC solvent B (80% ACN in 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 200 nL/min over 46 min. MS data acquisition was conducted in the positive ion mode. The mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent mode, switching automatically between one full scan and subsequent MS/MS scans of the 12 most abundant peaks selected with an isolation window of 1.4 m/z (mass/charge ratio). Full-scan MS spectra were acquired in a mass range from 300 to 1650 m/z at a target value of 3 \u00d7 10 6 charges with the maximum injection time of 25 ms and a resolution of 60,000 (defined at m/z 200). The higher-energy collisional dissociation MS/MS spectra were recorded with the maximum injection time of 45 ms at a target value of 1 \u00d7 10 5 and a resolution of 30,000 (defined at m/z 200). The normalized collision energy was set to 27%, and the intensity threshold was kept at 1 \u00d7 10 5 . The masses of sequenced precursor ions were dynamically excluded from MS/MS fragmentation for 30 s. Ions with single, unassigned, or six and higher charge states were excluded from fragmentation selection.\n\nFor dimethylation labeling, after tryptic in-gel digestion, derived peptides were loaded on C18 StageTips and labeled as described (70) . Measurements were done the same way as for the unlabeled.\n\nFor label-free MS, raw data files were processed using MaxQuant software suite v.1.6.0.1 (71) at default settings. Using the Andromeda search engine (72) integrated in the software, the spectra were searched against UniProt D. melanogaster (taxonomy ID 7227) complete proteome database (11/07/2017; 23300 protein entries; https://www.uniprot.org/), a database comprising a sequence of the tag alone and a file containing 245 common contaminants. In the database search, Trypsin was defined as a cleaving enzyme, up to two missed cleavages were allowed. Carbamidomethylation (Cys) was set as fixed modification, whereas oxidation (Met) and acetylation (protein N termini) were set as variable modifications. The mass tolerances for precursor and fragment ions were set to default values of 20ppm and 0.5Da, respectively.\n\nMaxLFQ algorithm was activated and the minimum number of peptide ratio count was set to 1 (73) . All peptide and protein identifications were filtered using a target-decoy approach with a false discovery rate (FDR) set . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

A valid protein identification required at least one peptide with a posterior error probability (PEP) value of 0.01 or smaller. To transfer peptide identifications to unidentified or unsequenced peptides between samples, for quantification, matching between runs option was selected, with a match time window of 0.7 min and an alignment time window of 20 min. Matching was performed only between replicates by controlling the fraction numbers. The same parameters were used to process the raw data from the experiments applying dimethyl labeling, except for The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.08.899146 doi: bioRxiv preprint for dimethylMS). Normalized ratios were Log2-transformed and ratios from duplicates were plotted against each other. Statistically significant differences in abundance were determined by applying an arbitrary ratio threshold of 1 in Log2 scale (twofold).\n\nAll the scatter plots and the volcano plots were generated using GraphPad Prism v.7.0.0. For creating networks or subnetworks, Cytoscape v. 3.7.1 (76) was used. To integrate IP-MS data with literature, information from databases like String v. 11.0 (77) and FlyBase (78) were used. From String, only experimental data with medium confidence range was considered. Physical interaction data from FlyBase (78) were extracted for each protein individually. Node size calculation: For dimethyl labeling data, average of the enrichment ratios of duplicates was calculated for each protein. If a protein was found to be associated with more than one bait or identified in both label-free and labeled MS data, the highest fold change value was considered, irrespective of the experiment type. In cases where several nodes were combined into one, the highest value among the respective individual components was considered. Fig. 4 was created using\n\nGephi v. 0.9.2 (79) . Modules were detected with an algorithm described in (80) , with randomization on, using edge weights and a resolution of 0.5. Force-field-based clustering was performed using the Force Atlas 2\n\nPlugin. Baits were re-positioned manually for clarity.\n\nFor GO term analysis, the DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) v.6.8 functional annotation tool was used (81, 82) , which adopts Fisher's Exact test to measure the geneenrichment in annotation terms. The following parameters were used: background: Drosophila genome; count threshold (minimum number of genes for that term) of 2; maximum ease score (modified Fisher's Exact P-value) of 0.01. To reduce redundancy in the GO terms, the DAVID output was fed into REVIGO (Reduce + Visualize Gene Ontology) (83) and p-values were used to select and cluster GO terms with a similarity score of 0.7 (medium). The Drosophila database was used to find the GO term sizes. See supplementary table for GO analysis.

We used the \"Tagged FlyFos TransgeneOme\" resource (fTRG) (66) expressing Cterminally-tagged proteins under the regulation of their endogenous promoters. These lines carry a 40 kDa tagging cassette consisting of \"2XTY1-sGFP-V5-preTEV-BLRP-3XFLAG\" that can be used for both in vivo visualization and affinity purification. From the fTRG library, we selected six RBPs for IP-MS, eIF4AIII, Glo, Hrp48, Nos, Stau and Vas. To serve as a control, we generated a transgenic line expressing the tag alone (hereafter referred to as GFP), under the promoter of a moderately expressing gene (exu). To ensure that the RBP fusions are functional in vivo, we checked their localization patterns at different stages of oogenesis.\n\nAll the proteins were found to be localized as expected (Fig. S1a, b) . Additionally, we also checked their ability to rescue the effects of mutations that cause either lethality or sterility, as summarized in Fig. S1c .\n\nAlthough only 3 out of 6 transgenes assayed were able to fully substitute for the endogenous copy, their localization in the endogenous patterns suggests that their interactions driving localization during oogenesis have been maintained.\n\nFor IP, we lysed whole ovaries in mild conditions of salt and detergent, and purified the complexes using the GFP-TRAP system (Chromotek) (Fig. 1a ). An IP from flies expressing GFP alone was used as a negative control to identify proteins binding nonspecifically to the tag. Since we were interested in identifying RNAindependent protein-protein interactions, the experiments were carried out in the presence of RNases. As the transgenes are regulated by their endogenous promoters, they had varying levels of expression, as observed by Western blotting (Fig. 1b) . To compensate for this variability in the IP-MS analysis, we adjusted the number of flies dissected for each transgene (Table S2 ).\n\nAll the samples were prepared in biological triplicates and the resulting spectra were searched against the Drosophila melanogaster proteome database (Fig. 1a, Fig. S2a ). For confident identification of proteins and . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Additionally, we activated the \"matching between runs\" algorithm to quantify unidentified or un-sequenced peptides in the samples, by transferring peptide identifications among replicates. The global analysis of the proteomes resulted in the identification of 15,005 peptides mapping to 1878 protein groups, at a FDR of 1% at the peptide and protein level. Of these, 1841 unique protein groups were quantified in at least one of the 21 samples, which account for 87.5% of the total ovary proteome of Drosophila (84) . The average correlation within replicates ranged from 0.71 (Glo) to 0.92 (Hrp48), suggesting overall good reproducibility of the data (Fig. 1c ). In addition, the visualization of LFQ intensities of all the samples as a heat map demonstrates that all the baits were consistently enriched (Fig.   S2c ). The replicate profiles looked largely similar, with only minor differences. However, the number of proteins quantified with each bait varied highly, as marked by the absence of information in the heat map ( Fig. S2c ).\n\nFor statistical analysis, we considered only those proteins that were quantified in all three replicates of a given sample. To identify significantly enriched proteins, we employed the Welch's t-test (with the 5-10% For all the baits, we found several known interactants to be reproducibly enriched over control, mostly with statistical significance (Fig. 2a) . For example, we co-purified all the other core components of the Exon Junction Complex (EJC) with eIF4AIII-GFP (25) and the NOT proteins with Nos-GFP (85, 86) . We also detected known partners of Vas, involved in both pole plasm assembly in the oocyte (Oskar (Osk); Gustavus (Gus); Fat facets (Faf); F-box synaptic protein (Fsn); Fmr1) and production of germline piRNAs in the nuage (Tejas (Tej); Spindle-E (SpnE); Kumo (Qin); Tapas), with high confidence (87) . This indicates that our experimental conditions and analysis pipeline can preserve and identify true interactions. In addition, we also identified proteins that are known to be indirectly associated with Vas, such as the Cullin proteins (88) and\n\nTudor-domain proteins Tudor (Tud) (89) and Krimper (Krimp) (90) , suggesting that we not only recovered direct interactants, but whole complexes functional in distinct pathways (Fig. S3 ). With the Glo-GFP bait, we . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

However, the enrichment was not significant for these proteins, suggesting weak or transient interactions.\n\nTo detect fold changes in protein abundances with high precision, we used dimethyl labeling MS. This approach is advantageous for Drosophila, where metabolic isotopic labeling is still challenging. To confirm the results of our label-free analysis, we carried out dimethyl labeling MS for the Hrp48-and Vas-GFP samples. We chose Hrp48 and Vas as these proteins express well and they are involved in the translational regulation of the same set of transcripts (35, 36, 40, 45-47). We carried out the experiments in duplicates and purified the samples the same way as for label-free MS (Fig. S2b ). After in-gel digestion, we labeled the peptides with heavy, medium or light isotopes and inverted the labels in the replicate, to minimize the variability due to the labeling procedures. As before, the raw data were processed with the MaxQuant software (71), providing confident identification of proteins (1% FDR) and normalized protein-abundance ratios. The analysis of the Vas-and Hrp48-associated proteomes resulted in the identification of 4027 peptides, mapping to 615 protein groups. The replicates showed high correlation and the abundance ratios calculated could be well duplicated. We considered as a hit those proteins that we identified with an abundance ratio of >2 in both replicates. Consistent with the label-free analysis, we found several known interactors, most of them reproducibly enriched (Fig. 2b ). To check how the two analyses relate to each other, we mapped the proteins identified in labeled MS onto the label-free MS data. As shown in Fig. 3 , the proteins that were significantly enriched in the labeled MS followed the same distribution profile and showed up to 47% overlap (for Vas) with those enriched in the label-free MS analysis. Background proteins identified in labeled MS (<2 fold in both replicates) showed a similar profile when graded on the corresponding label-free MS data (Fig. 3 ). To get a comprehensive view of the proteomes associated with Hrp48 and Vas, we combined the enriched proteins from both analyses.\n\n. CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

While each bait has its distinct proteome, the network is also connected, in agreement with the spatial and temporal distribution of the transcripts they regulate. In particular, we observed a considerable overlap between functionally related proteins such as Hrp48 and Glo (Fig. S4 ). To gain a systemic understanding of the network, we also added the known protein-protein associations from the String v. 11.0 (77) and FlyBase (78) databases. Next, we carried out a modularity analysis to identify highly connected communities of proteins (Fig. 4a ). As expected, many proteins involved in oogenesis, mRNA localization, translational regulation and germ cell formation were selectively enriched with all the baits. Additionally, proteins involved in neurogenesis and splicing were also overrepresented, consistent with the well-studied function of selected RBPs in these processes (Fig. 4b) .\n\nInterestingly, we observed ribosomal proteins (components of both large and small subunits) to be significantly enriched with Vas-GFP and Hrp48-GFP, but not with the other RBPs analyzed (Fig. 5, Fig. S4 ).\n\nPrevious studies have shown the requirement of Vas in translational activation of osk, nos and grk mRNAs (35, 36, 40, 49). However, the molecular mechanism by which Vas activates translation is unclear. Studies in Drosophila have shown that Vas directly binds the translation initiation factor eIF5B (dIF2) to positively regulate grk and mei-P26 translation and possibly other germline-specific transcripts (92) (93) (94) . In addition, Vas also interacts genetically with the translation initiation factor eIF4A for efficient germ cell formation (95) .\n\nHowever, neither eIF5B nor eIF4A were detected or enriched in our dataset. Instead, other translation initiation factors involved in the formation of the pre-initiation complex, such as eIF2, eIF3 and the cap-binding complex of eIF4E-4G were selectively co-purified (Fig. 5 ). This is consistent with the recently reported interaction of eIF3 subunits with Vas in the Drosophila oocytes (56).\n\nHrp48 is required for the translational repression of osk and grk mRNAs (45-47). Consistent with this, we copurified with Hrp48-GFP (in both label-free and labeled MS experiments) several P-body-components, associated with the RNA repression/decay machinery, most notably the deadenylase and decapping complexes (Fig. 6) . Ribosomal proteins and translation initiation factors were also significantly enriched with the Hrp48-GFP bait, similar to Vas-GFP (Fig. 5) . This includes eIF3d, which has recently been reported to interact with Hrp48 to translationally repress the msl-2 mRNA (96). \n\nTo validate the results of our IP-MS analysis, we co-expressed bait-candidate pairs in cultured mammalian HEK293 cells. This system can be effectively used to study direct interactions of Drosophila proteins because it reduces the likelihood of endogenous proteins mediating indirect associations. For validation, we selected significantly enriched candidates identified in the label-free MS analysis. Additionally, we also considered functionally relevant partners, enriched with a >2 times fold change but excluded by statistical filtering. For\n\nHrp48 and Vas, where information from differential labeling was also available, we selected candidates among the interacting proteins identified in both datasets.\n\nTypically, we co-expressed an EGFP (referred to as GFP)-tagged bait with an HA-tagged candidate protein and used the GFP-TRAP system (Chromotek) for IPs. We observed that small proteins (<25kDa) expressed poorly as fusions with HA or HA-Flag. Substitution with the GFP tag improved the expression in all the cases tested. To be able to validate the interactions of such small proteins, we co-expressed an HA-Flag-tagged candidate with a GFP-tagged bait and performed the IP with anti-Flag (Fig. 7f, h) . Since Vas does not express well as an HA-or HA-Flag fusion, the small proteins could not be assayed efficiently for interaction with Vas.\n\nAs negative controls, we used MBP or GFP. We also included known interactions as positive controls, wherever possible. All the tested candidates are indicated in Fig. S5 .\n\nOut of 90 protein-protein interactions assayed, we could confirm 32 interactions (35%), of which 26 were found to be novel (summarized in Fig. S6a ). All positive interactions were confirmed at least 3 times, in independent experiments. In addition, we were also able to validate some of the interactions by reciprocal IP, as shown in Fig. 7i . To further confirm that our MS analysis pipeline effectively separated background binders from true interactants, we also tested Nucleophosmin (Nph), which was depleted in all IP-MS datasets. We could not detect interactions of Nph with any of the 4 baits tested in vitro (data not shown), in line with the MS data. Additionally, we also tested Sqd that has been reported to interact with Hrp48 in an RNA-dependent manner (47). The negative results further confirm that our experimental conditions effectively disrupted RNA-mediated associations and only protein-protein interactions were confidently identified in our analyses. To visualize the co-IP results, we integrated the validated interactions with the IP-MS data (both labeled and label-free) and information from the literature to create a subnetwork (Fig. S6b) .

To construct this network, we purified complexes associated with bait proteins and used the MaxLFQ algorithm (73) for label-free relative protein quantification. The accuracy of this approach is comparable to labeled MS techniques such as SILAC (97).\n\nBy statistical filtering, we could separate background and specific binders for each bait. Several well characterized interactions were significantly enriched with most baits, indicating the efficacy of our workflow.\n\nTo complement these data, we also obtained MS data from dimethyl labeling for a subset of the baits. We were able to validate 32 of the interactions assayed, including several novel associations.\n\nIn addition to the known regulators of mRNA localization and oocyte patterning, we co-purified nuclear and The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.08.899146 doi: bioRxiv preprint Nuclear processing is intrinsically linked to cytoplasmic targeting of maternal mRNAs\n\nIn addition to their crucial role in pre-mRNA processing, splicing factors also affect the cytoplasmic fates of mRNAs. SmB, a spliceomosomal Sm protein is a known osk mRNP component. SmB contributes to germcell specification, at least in part by facilitating osk mRNA localization (103) and fails to localize to the posterior of the oocyte in the absence of Vas (104) . Several Sm proteins have also been detected to be associated with Vas in the oocytes (56). Consistent with this, we co-purified SmB with Stau, Glo, Hrp48 and Vas. We also purified other splicing regulators with several of our baits, including pUF68 (105) and the SR family proteins SC35 and SF2 (106, 107) . Both SC35 and SF2 could be validated for their interaction with Glo and Stau, while pUF68 bound eIF4AIII and Stau in vitro. pUF68 was previously shown to interact with Hrp48 and Glo (38) and SF2 co-purifies with the short isoform of Osk (108) . These results together with the well-studied role of SR proteins in cytoplasmic regulation of gene expression including mRNA export, decay and translation in mammalian systems (109, 110) suggest that splicing factors are bona fide components of the mRNA localization machinery.\n\nIn agreement with the function of Vas in enhancing the translation of maternal mRNAs (35, 36, 40, 49), we co-purified several ribosomal proteins and translation initiation factors with Vas-GFP. Our results suggest that Vas may recruit factors involved in translation initiation. This is also supported by the interaction of Vas with eIF5B and eIF3 subunits, as previously reported (56, [92] [93] [94] .\n\nIn contrast to Vas, Hrp48 is a known translational repressor (45-47). In line with the localization of Hrp48 to P-bodies (111), we co-purified several components of the mRNA decay machinery, including the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex with Hrp48-GFP. It is possible that these interactions are indirect and mediated by BicaudalC (BicC) and Belle (Bel). These proteins negatively regulate target mRNAs together with the CCR4-NOT complex (112, 113) . We demonstrated in vitro binding of Hrp48 with both BicC and Bel. This suggests that by recruiting these proteins, Hrp48 may regulate the nos and osk mRNAs, possibly via CCR4-NOT mediated deadenylation ( Fig. 8; ref. (112-115) ). The function of Hrp48 in nos regulation remains to be investigated (Fig. 8) . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Several lines of evidence from Drosophila, including binding of Hrp48 to a derepressor element in the osk 5'UTR (45), identification of Hrp48 as a part of a protein complex functioning in translational enhancement of Hsp83 mRNA (116) and interaction of Hrp48 with CPEB (cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding) protein Orb (this study) support the dual nature of Hrp48. hnRNP A2, the mammalian homolog of Hrp48, also exhibits the ability to mediate both translational stimulation (117) as well as repression (118) , further strengthening the argument.\n\nAlong with several known regulators of maternal mRNAs, we identified the protein products of many previously uncharacterized genes. One such example is CG5726, which encodes for a protein with a MIF4Glike domain. This domain is found in many proteins involved in RNA metabolism including translation initiation factors, NMD factors and nuclear cap-binding proteins (65, [119] [120] [121] [122] . With no identifiable orthologs in humans, CG5726 protein shows up to 50% sequence identity among Drosophilids. In early embryos of Drosophila melanogaster, CG5726 interacts with short Osk (108) . In this study, we found CG5726 to be interacting with multiple RBPs: Glo, Hrp48 and Vas, suggesting its possible role in translational regulation.\n\nConsistent with the well-documented role of RNA helicases in oogenesis and fertility (87, (123) (124) (125) (126) , we identified two putative DEAD-box helicases, CG10077 and Mahe (Maheshvara). While CG10077 is an ortholog of human DDX5, Mahe is an evolutionary conserved regulator of Notch signaling (127) . We could recapitulate the interaction of Mahe with both Hrp48 and Glo, and CG10077 with Glo in our co-IP assay. mRNAs. Integrating isolated complexes into interaction networks will further enable functional insights into poorly characterized proteins. Given the evolutionary conservation of several RBPs, our study provides a framework to transfer information to other systems, enhancing our understanding of regulation of RBPs and their diverse roles in developmental processes.
