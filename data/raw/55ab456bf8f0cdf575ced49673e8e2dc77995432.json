{"title": "Molecular Cloning and Phylogenetic Analysis of ORF7 Region of Chinese Isolate TH-98 from Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus*", "body": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine (TGEV) is an enveloped virus and belongs to a member of groups of coronaviruses, which is one of the most important causative agents of enteric infection. The infection is associated with high morbidity in animals of all ages and with high mortality in suckling piglets [1] [2] [3] .\n\nTGEV genome is a single-stranded, positivesense 28.5-kb RNA. About two-thirds of the entire RNA comprises open reading frames (ORFs) 1a and 1b, encoding the replicase. The 3\u00a2 one-third of the genome comprises the genes encoding the structural and non-structural proteins [4] [5] [6] . The genes of TGEV are arranged in the order 5_-rep-S-3a-3b-E-M-N-7-3_. Four of them, rep, 3a, 3b, and 7, encode non-structural proteins [7] . At present, the functions of four structural proteins encoded by spike S, membrane M, envelope E, nucleoprotein N genes respectively are being deeply elucidated, and some characteristics have been ascertained and explained [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Nevertheless, the functional action of non-structural proteins is poorly understood currently.\n\nThe ORF7 we designated it as hp gene encoding a small hydrophobic protein (HP) and mapping at the 3\u00a2 end of TGEV genome was expressed during virus replication. A CYAAAC conserved They contributed equally to this work. intergenic sequence located the upstream of hp gene separates it from the N gene. The characteristics distinguished TGEV from other members of coronavirus family, such as murine hepatitis virus (MHV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), infectious bronchtitis virus (IBV) and Human coronavirus (HCoV-OC43) [4, 5] . HP is immunoprecipitable with porcine hyperimmuned anti-TGEV serum. The intracellular localization of HP suggests that it may play an important role in the process of membrane integrity of viral replication and/or virion assembly [15] .\n\nIn this report, the hp gene was cloned by RT-PCR from a recently isolated TGEV in north China, the sequences of hp DNA and HP protein were compared with some other references strains derived from different regions and/or countries. Correspondingly, a phylogenetic tree was constructed and analyzed according to their ORF7 DNA sequence. The similarity and discrepancy among different strains have been demonstrated, which will contribute to the further functional exploration and genesis investigation of TGEV.\n\nTGEV strain named TH-98 was isolated from a suburb of Harbin, capital of Heilongjiang province, P.R. China, and Swine testicle (ST) cell line was grown as monolayer in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (GIBCO, USA) containing 10% fetal calf serum (GIBCO, USA) and 5% CO 2 in air. Viruses were harvested by three cycles of freezing and thawing, cellular debris was removed by low speed centrifugation at 10 \u00b7 l0 3 g (HITACHI CR22E, Japan) at 4\u00b0C for 25 min, and virions in supernatant were pelleted by centrifugation at 100 \u00b7 10 3 g at 4\u00b0C for 1.5 h (HITACHI CR22E, Japan).\n\nTotal RNA was isolated from purified pellets using SDS-Protease K according to reference [16] .\n\nExtracted RNA was added into the below components: 5\u00b7 reverse transcription buffer 1 ll, dNTP mixture (2.5 mM) 4 ll, RNase inhibitor 0.5 ll, primer P1 5 ll, AMV reverse transcriptase 2 ll (10 U), sterile water 3.5 ll, gently mixed in an Eppendorf tube and incubated at room temperature for 10 min, then transferred to a water incubator at 42\u00b0C for l h prior to stored at )20\u00b0C until use in PCR.\n\nThe cDNA obtained was amplified with the following primers P1 (5\u00a2-AATCTA-GATGCTCGTCCTCCT-3\u00a2) and P2 (5\u00a2-GAC-ATCGGGTACCCTTACATT-3\u00a2), the sequences of which were based on corresponding conservative region of hp gene from reference strain (Miller) and contained the full-length ORF7, in brief, the forward primer (P1) flanked at the 5\u00a2 end of ORF7 gene, which contained an artificial a XbaI site (blackened sequence) and the reverse primer P2 is complementary to 3\u00a2 end outside, in which has an artificial KpnI sites (blackened sequence). The primers were designed with Oligo 4.1 version software and synthesized by Takara Biotechnology Company (Dalian, China). PCR amplification was performed using PE2400 PCR equipment (USA). PCR was in 100 ll volumes, using 10 ll of 10\u00b7 buffer (50 mM KC1, 100 mM Tris-Cl pH8.3, 15 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1% gelate, 16 ll dNTP mixture (10 mM), 1 ll cDNA, 5 ll of P1 and P2 and l ll Taq polymerase (0.5u Takara, Dalian, China). The temperature profile was 30 cycles of 60 s at 94\u00b0C, 1 min at 47.9\u00b0C and 1.5 min at 72\u00b0C, there was then a final extension time of 5 min at 72\u00b0C. A 2 ll aliquot of PCR product was visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis (2% agarose, 100 Vs for 20 min, 0.8 lg/ ml ethidium bromide included in gel) and subsequent U.V transillumination. The purified PCR product was named hp.\n\nPCR product was gel purified and digested with restriction endonuclease (RE) KpnI and XbaI and cloned into the corresponding sites of prokaryotic expression vector pPROEX HTc (GIBCO, USA) by transformation of competent cell JM109 (Takara, Dalian, China), and a positive recombinant named pPROEX HTc-hp was selected with blue and white screening as well as the plasmid extracted with extraction Kits (Huashun, shanghai, China) was identified with RE. In addition, primers P1 and P2 were used for nested PCR identification of the recombinant.\n\npPROEX HTc-hp was sequenced using dideoxynucleotide chaintermination procedures [17] by Sangon bio-company, Shanghai, China. Sequence of hp gene and its deduced amino acids were compared with that of TFI, TO-163, Ohira, Iga-1, Aomori, Ogawa, Miller, Purdue, 96-1933, and RM4 using Genedoc and Genestar softwares. The TGEV origin places and Genbank accession numbers of these ORF7 sequences are summarized in Table 1 .\n\nA phylogenetic tree was generated using an alignment of ORF7 nucleotide sequences from the above-mentioned viruses by applying the Neighbor-joining method in the CLUSTAL X v1.82 program, which subsequently subjects to be edited manually.\n\nTo isolate total RNA of TGEV purified pellets using SDS-Protease K and synthesize the cDNA containing hp gene with primer P1. The total RNA of TGEV was high concentration and purity, however, cDNA of TGEV was synthesized and could be detected through agarose gel electrophrosis (Fig. 1 illustrates) .\n\nThe cDNA was used as template, and a fragment was amplified with forward primer P1 and reverse primer P2. The expected PCR product is 258 base pair (bp), meanwhile, a known about 260bp-sized fragment was amplified (data not shown), which served as positive PCR control and additional DNA Marker (Fig. 2 illustrates) . \n\nThe linear recombinant named pPROEX HTc-hp is 4779 bp in length, which consist of 4.7 kb-sized prokaryotic vector, pPROEX HTc and about 0.26 kb-sized hp gene. Bands with the expected size were detected were detected on agarose gel containing 0.1% ethidium bromide after digestion with KpnI-XbaI (Fig. 3 illustrates) .\n\npPROEX HTc-hp circle plasmid was used as template for PCR identification with primer P1 and P2, the PCR product was about 260 bp as expected (Fig. 4 illustrates) . Because the recombinant will be directly sequenced, we did not design new primers for nested PCR identification.\n\nThe DNA sequence of TH-98 ORF7 was compared with the others, the multiple sequences alignment was showed (Fig. 5 illustrates) \n\nIn order to further elucidate the phylogeny of TGEV strains, the Neighbor-joining method in the CLUSTAL X vl.82 program, a online tool provided by The European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) was utilized to generate a phylogentic tree on the basis of the ORF7 DNA sequences (Fig. 6 illustrates) . As for as the evolution distance was concerned that all the Asian TGEV strains closer to the American TGEV strains, but not to European strains. However, some strains isolated in the same country were clustered into different positions of the phylogenetic tree, such as TH-98, TFI, or Purdue and Miller etc. (Fig. 6 illustrates). \n\nHP protein of TGEV located in cell membrane, which may play a role associated with the process of membrane integrity and assembly of virion [18] . It was supposed that ORF7 gene might interact with viral RNA and/or other viral proteins of TGEV [13, 15, 19] . In addition to this point, it may influence virus pathogenesis [20] . However, the concrete integrity mechanism and the function in viral invasion course are not clear presently.\n\nIn this study, Chinese TGEV isolate was propagated on ST cells, and the cytopathic effects (CPE) was significant morphologically, the cells were beginning to round out, condensate and peel off gradually after challenged with TGEV. Finally, the typical CPE of cell monolayer is like a net formed by several cells and no syncytia formation (data not shown), so we further verified that ST cells were excellent permissive to TGEV infection. To consider economical reason, we purified TGEV viral pellets by different speed centrifugation and extracted RNA using common chemical reagent according to standard Manual of RNA manipulation [16] . The results showed that RNA extracted was high concentration and purity, however, cDNA of TGEV were synthesized without difficulty. The hp gene of TGEV Chinese isolate was cloned with RT-PCR and genetic recombination techniques for the first time. The recombinant can express the encoded protein directly in E coli. due to the utilizing a prokaryotic expression vector substituted for clone vector, which benefits to the further functional research and structural analysis.\n\nThe nucleotide sequence comparison showed that there was no deletion or insertion in the hp gene of all the TGEV strains used here. There were relatively high frequency changes from nucleotide T to C in the Chinese isolate TH-98 compared with the others, and if the kind of point mutation will influence the virulence or tropism of the virus will be further discussed in future. To analyze the sequence differences from the angle of geographical distribution, five Japanese strains' ORF7 sequences had the exact identity with the exception of TO-163, TGEV Chinese isolate, TH-98 and TFI shares high homology with these reference strains in term of hp gene (ORF7), which confirmed that 3\u00a2-terminal region of TGEV genome is relatively conservative. TH-98 isolate owned higher homol-ogous identities with all the Asian and the American strains listed here. Nevertheless, there were more point mutations existed between Asian strains including TH-98 and the European strains.\n\nIn order to deeply investigate the evolutionary relationship between TH-98 and the other strains, a phylogenetic tree was generated on the basis of their nucleotide sequences of ORF7. In agree with the sequence comparison, the tree topology showed all the TGEV Asian strains posses extremely intimate relationship with the American strains and are relatively alien to the European strains. Interestingly, the TGEV strains that isolated in the same or close continent geographically were divided into different clusters on the tree respectively, for example, TGEV Chinese isolates TH-98 and TFI, American strains Miller and Purdue, TO-163 and other Japanese isolates etc. Combining the sequence identity data with consideration geographical and historical factors, the evolutionary analysis demonstrated that (i) the existence of geographically natural barrier has limited the transmission of TGEV to some extent; (ii) there were genetic mutation or recombination events happened in the origin of TGE, which derived from either the dissimilarly of regional environmental selective pressure or/and the immigration of foreign TGEV."}
