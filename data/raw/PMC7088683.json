The BuOH extract was washed with H2O (2 \u00d750 mL), dried over MgSO4, and evaporated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in EtOH (70 \u2013 75%, 50 mL) and worked up with KU-2-8 cation exchanger (H+-form). The cation exchanger was filtered off and washed with EtOH. The filtrate was evaporated. The resulting samples were analyzed by HPLC and separated by CC over SG. Samples were dissolved in a small volume of MeOH, placed on the SG column, and eluted by CHCl3:MeOH:H2O (200:10:1, 100:10:1, 50:10:1, 25:10:1, vol%, stepwise gradient) with TLC or HPLC monitoring of the fractions.

The cytotoxicity of the compound was assayed in MT-4 cell culture as described before [13, 14]. The drug was dissolved in DMSO and applied at the appropriate dilutions to plate wells (three wells for each dilution) seeded with cells (0.5 \u00d7 106 cells/mL). The final drug concentration in the cell suspension was from 1 \u03bcg/mL to 2 mg/mL. Cells were cultivated in 96-well culture plates (Costar, USA) in RPMI-1640 growth medium with added fetal calf serum (10%), L-glutamine (0.06%), and gentamicin (100 \u03bcg/mL) at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere with CO2 (5%) for 4 d.\n\nWhen the incubation was finished, the fraction of vital cells was counted in a Goryaev chamber after staining with trypan blue. Dose-dependent curves were constructed and the cytotoxic drug concentration causing the death of 50% of the cells (CC50) was determined.\n\nThe antiviral activity of II was studied by the traditional method of primary infected HIV (HIV-1) grafted human T-lymphocytes (MT-4 cell line) using strain HIV-1/EVK as before [13, 14]. MT-4 cells (2 \u00d7 106 cells/mL) were infected with strain HIV-1/EVK with 0.2 \u2013 0.5 infection units per cell in order to assay the anti-HIV-1 activity of II. The virus was adsorbed for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Infected and control cells (without virus) were diluted with growth medium to 5 \u00d7 105 cells/mL and placed into 96-well culture plates. Then, the appropriate wells were treated with solutions of II in DMSO (three wells for each dilution) and cultivated as described above. The final drug concentration in the cell suspension was from 0.5 to 2.0%. The reference drug was GA (95%) at a concentration of 100 \u03bcg/mL.\n\nThe inhibiting effect of II was assayed on the fourth day of cultivation by measuring the amount of virus antigen p24 using an immuno-enzyme method. In addition, the fraction of vital cells was determined using trypan blue exclusion. Dose-dependent curves were constructed and the quantitative inhibition characteristics were determined as IC50, the compound concentration suppressing by 50% virus production or protecting 50% of the cells from death due to infection; IC90, the compound concentration suppressing by 90% virus production or protecting 90% of the cells from death due to infection; SI, the selectivity or therapeutic index, i.e., the ratio of CC50 to the effective concentration IC50. Table 2 presents the results.\n\n\nEffect of II on RNA-dependent DNA-polymerase activity of HIV-1 RT. We used recombinant HIV-1 RT that was isolated from expressed vector p6HRT in JM109 culture of E. coli according to the literature [14]. Enzyme containing six histidines at the N-terminus was purified using Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The concentration of purified RT was determined by spectrophotometry at 280 nm using molar extinction coefficient 260,450 M\u20131 \u00b7 cm\u20131 for heterodimeric RT. RT activity was determined using [3H]-TTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA, USA) and poly(riboA)-oligo(dT)12 \u2013 18 as the matrix-primer (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA).\n\nRNA-dependent DNA-polymerase activity of RT was determined with and without the different concentrations of II using 0.2 units/mL of poly(riboA)-oligo(dT)12 \u2013 18, RT (2 nM), [3H]-TTP (5 \u03bcM) at a final volume of 50 \u03bcL in buffer containing Tris-HCl (50 mM, pH 8.0), KCl (60 \u03bcM), and MgCl2 (10 mM). Samples were incubated for 20 min at 37\u00b0C. The reaction was stopped by adding cold trichloroacetic acid (TCA, 10%, 200 \u03bcL) containing sodium pyrophosphate (20 mM) and incubation for 20 min in an ice bath. Samples were filtered through a 1.2-\u03bcm filter containing type C fiberglass into 96-well plates (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). The filters were rinsed successively with TCA (2\u00d7, 10%) and EtOH (2\u00d7, 95%). The amount of [3H]-TTP incorporated into the precipitate of nucleic acids was counted using a liquid-scintillation counter."}
