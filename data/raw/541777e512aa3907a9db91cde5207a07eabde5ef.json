{"title": "Title: Lipidome profiles of postnatal day 2 vaginal swabs reflect fat composition of gilt's", "body": "Early nutritional environment affects long term health and fertility. In swine, colostrum ingestion 59 is essential for postnatal piglet survival, growth, and development because it provides immunity, 60 nutrients, energy, and bioactive factors [1, 2] . The window of opportunity for milk-borne bioactive 61 factors to influence neonate development is limited, and primarily occurs prior to closure of tight 62 junctions between cells lining the piglet's gut. Closure of the gut occurs by 48 h postnatal [3] . 63 During the first 48 h postnatal, piglets ingest up to 30% of their body weight in milk [4] . This time-64 period is a critical developmental period for the gilt reproductive system, including the formation 65 of uterine glands, otherwise known as adenogenesis [5, 6] . Colostrum ingestion significantly 66 affected the developmental trajectory of uterine tissue [7] [8] [9] [10] . Replacement gilts with less 67 colostrum consumption than littermates as indicated by blood immunocrit values had reduced litter 68 sizes relative to other sows [11, 12] . Colostrum-deprivation also resulted in significantly different 69 patterns of uterine gene and protein expression [13] .\n\nThe link between early nutritional environment, uterine development, and subsequent 72 reproductive potential led to the hypothesis that early nutritional environment affects 73 reproductive tract development and subsequently predicts long-term reproductive performance of 74 gilts. However, in order to evaluate uterine development, the animal must be euthanized. We 75 previously proposed that since the vagina is embryologically related to the uterus [14] , its 76 postnatal developmental trajectory may also be responsive to early nutritional environment. 77 Moreover, we proposed that using vaginal swabs to non-invasively sample lower reproductive 78 tract may serve as a means to evaluate differences in nutritional exposures on gilt development. 79 Using a biomarker-discovery technique known as multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) profiling, .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/593392 doi: bioRxiv preprint 80 we found that lipid profiles of vaginal swabs taken on postnatal day 14 differed between gilts 81 that were fed milk replacer during the first 48 h postpartum before return to litter versus gilts that 82 suckled sow's milk continuously from birth [15] .\n\nWhile our previous studies supported the potential of using biological material obtained from 85 vaginal swabs to distinguish between gilts exposed to different nutritional environments the first The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. Three to four gilts were selected per litter from eight different sows which were monitored 102 during parturition (Supplemental Figure S1 ). Immediately after delivery, all gilts were towel-103 dried, weighed, and placed in a holding cart until at least three gilts above 1.3 kg were delivered.\n\nWithin litter, each gilt was randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups and ear tagged for 105 identification. The four treatment groups were: suckled (S; n=8); suckled plus fat-supplement 106 (SF; n=5); bottle-fed with milk-replacer (B; n=8), and; bottle-fed milk replacer plus fat-107 supplement (BF; n=7). Body weights were recorded at birth and 48 h. All gilts were administered 108 a 2 ml dose of Camas experimental antibody product (Camas Incorporated; Le Center, MN) 109 using Pump It\u2122 Automatic Delivery System (Genesis Industries, Inc.) at birth, and at 3 h and 9 110 h after the first dose. Gilts in B and BF treatment groups were taken to a separate temperature-controlled nursery, 113 where they were placed in holding cages in groups of 2-3 piglets. Birthright\u2122 milk replacer 114 (Ralco Nutrition, Inc.) was mixed using the recommended concentration for orphaned piglets, .

Reconstituted milk replacer was stored in a refrigerator and 116 warmed to room temperature prior to feedings. Piglets were fed using Evenflo Classic slow-flow 117 0-3-month infant bottles (Evenflo Feeding, Inc.) approximately every 2 h, with a minimum of 5 118 ml fed per time point. In the event piglets did not consume at least 30 ml after two consecutive 119 feedings, 15 ml of milk replacer was oral gavage-fed using a 30 ml syringe and Kendall\u2122 4.7 120 mm x 41 cm feeding tube (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN). The fat supplement was administered 121 at the back of the throat in 3 ml room-temperature doses using a 5 ml syringe at 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 122 and 36 h after birth. Swallowing was observed to ensure the supplement was delivered.\n\nBlood samples were collected from gilts at 48 h postnatal. A 22 g x 1.5-inch needle and a 3 ml 125 serum Vacutainer \u00ae (BD Life Sciences) tube was used to collect blood by jugular venipuncture.\n\nBlood samples were refrigerated and allowed to clot overnight. Serum was collected following 127 centrifugation (Horizon Model 614B Centrifuge; Fisher Scientific) for 25 minutes at 2,500 g and 128 stored at -20\u00b0C until analysis.

Initial data processing 190 of the profiles obtained was carried out by converting each set of MRM-profiling method data 191 into mzML format using MSConvert20. Next, the signal intensity for the ions present in NL and 192 Prec mass spectra was obtained using an in-house script. Ions with values of counts >1000 were 193 selected as parent ions and the product ion or neutral loss information was used for selecting ion Table S2 ).

In this way, intensities for PC lipids were measured, and samples were diluted using the 209 same flow injection solvent to achieve a similar concentration for comparative relative analysis.

Glycerolipids with saturated bonds encompassed 37% of identified lipids ( Figure 1A ; 292 Supplemental Table S2 ). Glycerolipids with unsaturated bonds were next in abundance with 25% Table S2 ). Screening Phase I 296 analysis found 146 MRMs (Supplemental Table S3 ) that best discriminated between suckled and 297 bottle-fed vaginal lipids, and 197 MRMs (Supplemental Table S4 ) that best discriminated 298 between vaginal lipids of gilts with and without fat supplementation.
