{"title": "Outbreak of Middle East Respiratory", "body": "The daily risk for infection in each of the 3 settings was estimated by maximizing the loglikelihood of observing the given onset dates, incorporating the patient exposure to each setting and the incubation period distribution (Table 1) . For uncertainty intervals, we estimated the covariance as the inverse of the negative Hessian matrix, at the maximum log-likelihood estimate (1) . We then used this in a multivariate normal distribution, taking 10,000 samples, calculating the relative risk with each draw, and taking the 2.5, 50, and 97.5 percentiles of the resulting values.\n\nWe denote Si as the setting that the patient occupied on day i, taking values from \"E,\" \"I,\"\n\nor \"D\" (representing, respectively, the emergency department, inpatient areas, and dialysis unit).\n\nThus, for example, a series [S1, S2, S3] = [E, D, D] represents a patient who was in the emergency department on day 1, then spent 2 days in a dialysis unit before symptom onset.\n\nIn each setting, we assume that a patient has a daily probability of infection of p(E), p(I), p(D), respectively. Further, for a patient who acquires infection on day i, we denote IPij as the probability that this patient subsequently shows onset on day j.\n\nWith Si given by data, and IPij given by the log-normal distribution for the incubation period, we estimated the daily risks p(E), p(I), p(D) by a maximum-likelihood approach. In particular, for a single patient n, with an exposure history where mE, mI, mD are the number of patient-days spent in each of the hospital settings, that were not associated with infection.\n\nTo obtain point estimates for the daily risks, we maximized the log-likelihood with respect to p(E), p(I), p(D). To find the uncertainty intervals, we followed standard likelihood techniques (1) in calculating the inverse of the Hessian matrix at the maximum-likelihood estimate. This provides an estimate of the variance-covariance matrix; we used this in a multivariate normal distribution, taking 10,000 samples in a Monte Carlo simulation, and finding percentiles of the resulting values."}
