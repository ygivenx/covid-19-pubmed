The phylogenetic analysis using the 571 WGS of SARS-CoV-2 publicly 49 available (as of March 17 th 2020) found that this sequence clustered with a sequence 50 (EPI_ISL_408488) collected in Jiangsu, China on January 19 th , suggesting a separate 51 introduction of the virus from Asia (Fig 1) . Compared to the reference SARS-CoV-2 52 sequence, a 3-nucleotide deletion in open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) at position 1607-1609 53 was identified. This deletion was found in 100% of the reads at this position with a coverage 54 of 1745X around the deletion. Importantly, this deletion was also identified in 100% of the 55 reads of sample #1 and sample #3 with a coverage of 54X and 481X, respectively. Using 56\n\nCoV-GLUE resource, we found that this mutation leads to a deletion of amino acid 268 in 57 non-structural protein 2 (nsp2) [5] . This deletion in nsp2 (Asp268Del) was also characterized 58 in 37/571 (6.1%) of the WGS available on March 17 th (England n = 6; Netherlands n = 31). 59 WGS-based phylogenetic analysis found that 15 viruses containing this specific deletion were 60 close to viruses collected in China between December 2019 and early February 2020, while 61 23 viruses collected in the Netherlands in March 2020 have slightly diverged (Fig 1) . 62 SARS-CoV2 sequences were not further compared between the 2 patients due to largely 63 incomplete coverage of SARS-CoV2 genome in sample #1. Nonetheless, the longitudinal 64 samples from the asymptomatic patient (sample #2 vs sample #3) were compared using a 65 minimum depth of coverage of 100X in order to make a preliminary assessment of intra-host 66 genetic variability. Three SNVs were noticed between the 2 samples: C366A (nsp1: S34Y), 67 A20475G (synonymous mutation in nsp15), T24084A (protein S: L841H), suggesting intra-68 host evolution of the virus. For all 3 positions, nucleotides from sample #2 were still detected 69 in sample #3, but as minor variants. 70\n\nIn this short report, we present the first genetic characterization of a COVID-19 cluster in 71\n\nEurope. Despite low viral loads, the mNGS workflow used herein allowed to characterize the 72 4 whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV2 isolated from an asymptomatic patient, in 2 clinical 73 samples collected 1 day apart. Comparison of these sequences suggests viral evolution with 74 development of quasispecies. Specific studies using high depth of coverage to assess 75 quasispecies are needed to characterize potential intra-host adaptation. In addition, the present 76 workflow identified a new deletion in nsp2 (Asp268Del) The analysis included 571 WGS of SARS-CoV2 (>29,000 bp) collected in humans and 84 available on GISAID from March 17 th , 2020. The following sequences were excluded from 85 the analysis: EPI_ISL_406592, EPI_ISL_414588, EPI_ISL_412900, EPI_ISL_408487, 86 EPI_ISL_408483 and EPI_ISL_406595 because they were outliers, and EPI_ISL_413747, 87\n\nThe 88 hCoV19/Wuhan/IPBCAMSWH01/2019 strain was used as an outgroup virus. Genetic 89 distances were calculated using the Kimura's 2-parameter model (K80) and pairwise deletion. 90\n\nThe tree was constructed by the neighbour-joining method using R seqinr and ggtree 91 packages and validated using 1000 bootstrap pseudo-replicates. Sequence from sample #2 92 (EPI_ISL_410486) is indicated by the black arrow. Nucleotide alignment (1600 to 1614) is 93 depicted as a heatmap on the right panel with the 3-nucleotide deletion shown in black. 94 "}
