{"title": "", "body": "D iarrhea is one of the most likely reasons young beef calves become sick or die. 1 Besides its detriment to calf health and well-being, neonatal calf diarrhea is an economic burden to cattle producers due to poor calf performance, death, and the expense of medications and labor to treat sick calves. 2, 3 In addition, catching and treating young calves puts herd owners and their employees at risk of physical harm, and many producers become disheartened after investing long hours to treat scouring calves during an already exhausting calving season.\n\nCattle producers may not discuss neonatal calf diarrhea with a veterinarian until a serious outbreak occurs. Veterinarians investigating outbreaks of neonatal calf diarrhea must first make recommendations for therapy of affected calves, then take action to protect susceptible and unborn calves from ongoing exposure and illness. Finally, attention should focus on determining what future actions might prevent the disease in subsequent calving seasons. The outbreak investigation sometimes becomes sidetracked in the pursuit of an etiologic agent rather than identifying more useful explanations for the outbreak. Knowing the etiologic agent may provide an explanation for the proximal cause of a calf's illness or death (although that knowledge rarely explains the outbreak) or provide a solution for treatment, control, or prevention.\n\nNeonatal calf diarrhea is a complex, multifactorial, and temporally dynamic disease. [4] [5] [6] Agent, host, and environmental factors collectively explain neonatal calf diarrhea, and these factors interact dynamically over the course of time. Veterinarians must understand the relationships among these factors within the production system to control the disease or prevent its occurrence. 7\n\nNumerous infectious agents have been recovered from calves with neonatal diarrhea. 4, 5, 7, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Common agents of neonatal calf diarrhea include bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella, viruses such as rotavirus and coronavirus, and protozoa such as cryptosporidia. Bovine rotavirus, bovine coronavirus, and cryptosporidia are ubiquitous to most cattle populations and can be recovered from calves in herds not experiencing calf diarrhea. 7 Further, multiple agents can be recovered from herds experiencing outbreaks of calf diarrhea; suggesting that even during outbreaks more than one agent may be involved. The adult cow herd commonly serves as the reservoir of pathogens from one year to the next. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] \n\nCalves obtain passive immunity against common agents of calf diarrhea after absorbing antibodies from colostrum or colostrum supplements shortly after birth. [21] [22] [23] The quantity of antibodies absorbed is determined by the quality and quantity of colostrum the calf ingests, as well as how soon after birth it is ingested. In colostrum the presence of maternal antibodies against specific agents requires prior exposure of the dam to antigens of the agent. Vaccines are sometimes used to immunize the dam C H A P T E R 114 DAVID R. SMITH Management of Neonatal Diarrhea in Cow-Calf Herds against specific agents, and some commercially available colostrum supplements contain polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies directed against specific agents. Unfortunately, the use of vaccines or colostrum supplements has not always prevented undifferentiated neonatal calf diarrhea.\n\nCalves typically become ill or die from neonatal diarrhea within 1 to 2 weeks of age. 4, 8, 10, 24 The narrow range of age within which neonatal calf diarrhea occurs is not explained solely by the incubation period of the agents. Diarrhea is observed in colostrum-deprived and gnotobiotic calves within a few days of pathogen challenge regardless of age. [25] [26] [27] Calves may have an age-specific susceptibility to neonatal diarrhea that occurs as lactogenic immunity is waning and before the calf is fully capable of developing an active immune response. 21 Regardless of the reason for the age-specificity of neonatal calf diarrhea, this period defines the age of susceptibility, as well as the age calves are most likely to become infective and shed the agents in their feces. [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] Age specificity of susceptibility and infectivity has important implications for controlling transmission of the pathogens of neonatal diarrhea because in some calving systems the number of susceptible and infective calves can change dynamically with time. At times the number of potentially infective calves may greatly outnumber the number of susceptible calves, resulting in widespread opportunity for effective contacts.\n\nThe dam's age also explains a calf's risk for undifferentiated neonatal diarrhea. Calves born to heifers are at higher risk for neonatal diarrhea and have lower maternal antibody levels than calves born to older cows. 33 Calves born to heifers are probably more susceptible to disease because heifers produce a lower volume and quality of colostrum, may have poor mothering skills, and are more likely to experience dystocia. 34, 35 \n\nThe environment may influence both the level of pathogen exposure and the ability of the calf to resist disease. Exposure to pathogens may occur through direct contact with other cattle or via contact with contaminated environmental surfaces. Establishing environmental hygiene has long been recognized as important for controlling neonatal calf diarrhea, 36,37 but doing so is often a challenge. An effective contact is an exposure to pathogens of a dose-load or duration sufficient to cause disease. Crowded conditions increase opportunities for effective contacts with infected animals or contaminated surfaces. Ambient temperature (e.g., excessive heat or cold) and moisture (e.g., mud or snow) are important stressors that impair the ability of the calf to resist disease and may influence pathogen numbers, as well as opportunities for oral ingestion.\n\nHost susceptibility, pathogen exposure, and pathogen transmission occur dynamically over time within the calving season. 7 Although the adult cow-herd likely serves as the reservoir of neonatal diarrhea pathogens from year to year, 15-20 the average dose-load of pathogen exposure to calves is likely to increase over time within a calving season because calves infected earlier serve as pathogen multipliers and become the primary source of exposure to younger susceptible calves. This multiplier effect can result in high calf infectivity and widespread environmental contamination with pathogens. 38 Each calf serves as growth media for pathogen production, amplifying the dose-load of pathogen it received. [27] [28] [29] Therefore calves born later in the calving season may receive larger doseloads of pathogens and, in turn, may become relatively more infective by growing even greater numbers of agents. Eventually the dose-load of pathogens overwhelms the calf's ability to resist disease. These factors alone or in combination may explain observations that calves born later in the calving season are at greater risk for disease or death (Smith and colleagues, unpublished). 24\n\nBiosecurity is the sum of actions taken to prevent introducing a disease agent into a population (pen, herd, region), whereas biocontainment describes the actions taken to control a pathogen already present in the population. 39 In theory outbreaks of undifferentiated neonatal calf diarrhea could be prevented by eliminating the pathogens, decreasing calf susceptibility, or altering the production system to reduce opportunities for pathogen exposure and transmission. However, the endemic nature of the common pathogens of neonatal calf diarrhea makes it unlikely that cattle populations could be made biosecure from these agents. Maternal immunity is clearly important to calf susceptibility to enteric agents, 6,40 but lactogenic immunity wanes with time 21 and managers of extensive beef cattle systems have limited practical opportunities to improve rates of passive antibody transfer. In addition, vaccines are not available against all pathogens of calf diarrhea, they may not induce sufficient crossprotection, 32 and pathogens may evade the protection afforded by vaccination by evolving away from vaccine strains. 41 For these reasons, a biocontainment approach to control neonatal calf diarrhea seems prudent and logical. 39, 42 \n\nEffective contacts with pathogens can be prevented by physically separating animals, reducing the level of exposure (e.g., through the use of sanitation or dilution over space), or minimizing contact time. These principles have been successfully applied in calf hutch systems to control neonatal diseases in dairy calves. 43 Various biocontainment systems for beef herds have been developed to prevent neonatal calf diarrhea. [44] [45] [46] Each of these are strategies to manage cattle in a system that prevents calves from having effective contacts with pathogens by reducing opportunities for exposure and transmission. The management actions defined as the Sandhills Calving System prevent effective contacts among beef calves by (1) segregating calves by age to prevent direct and indirect transmission of pathogens from older to younger calves and (2) moving pregnant cows to clean calving pastures to minimize pathogen dose-load in the environment and contact time between calves and the larger portion of the cow herd. The objective of the system is to recreate the more ideal conditions that exist at the start of the calving season during each subsequent week of the season. These more ideal conditions are that cows are calving on ground that has been previously unoccupied by cattle (for at least some months), and older, infective calves are not present.\n\nThe Sandhills Calving System uses larger, contiguous pastures for calving, rather than high-animal-density calving lots. Cows are turned into the first calving pasture (Pasture 1) as soon as the first calves are born. Calving continues in Pasture 1 for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks the cows that have not yet calved are moved to Pasture 2. Existing cow-calf pairs remain in Pasture 1. After a week of calving in Pasture 2, cows that have not calved are moved to Pasture 3 and cow-calf pairs born in Pasture 2 remain in Pasture 2. Each subsequent week cows that have not yet calved are moved to a new pasture and pairs remain in their pasture of birth. The result is cow-calf pairs distributed over multiple pastures, each containing calves within 1 week of age of each other. Cow-calf pairs from different pastures may be commingled after the youngest calf is 4 weeks of age and all calves are considered low risk for neonatal diarrhea.\n\nIt can be difficult to manage many cattle groups in intensive grass management systems; therefore the Sandhills Calving System in these herds is modified to reduce the number of groups. Cattle are moved to different pastures throughout the calving season as appropriate for forage utilization; however, every 10 days, or whenever 100 calves are born, the herd is divided by sorting cows that had not calved from the cow-calf pairs of the preceding group. In this manner, fewer cattle groups are required, although the number of calves within any pasture group never exceeds 100, and all calves within a group are within 10 days of age of each other.\n\nThe Sandhills Calving System prevents effective contacts by using clean calving pastures, preventing direct contact between younger calves and older calves and preventing later-born calves from being exposed to an accumulation of pathogens in the environment. The specific actions to implement the system may differ between herds to meet the specific needs of each production system. Key components of the systems are age segregation of calves and the frequent movement of gravid cows to clean calving pastures. Age segregation prevents the serial passage of pathogens from older calves to younger calves. The routine movement (every 7-10 days) of gravid cows to new calving pastures prevents the buildup of pathogens in the calving environment over the course of the calving season and prevents exposure of the latest born calves to an overwhelming dose-load of pathogens.\n\nDevelopment of a ranch-specific plan for implementing the Sandhills Calving System must take place well in advance of the calving season, in some circumstances in consultation with a range specialist. Available pastures must be identified and their use coordinated with the calving schedule. Water, feed, shelter, and anticipated weather conditions must be considered. The size of the pastures should be matched to the number of calves expected to be born in a given week. Use of the pastures must not be damaging to later grazing.\n\nThe Sandhills Calving System may offer additional benefits to labor management. For example, there may be some efficiency because cattle movement could be scheduled once a week as labor is available. Moving cows without calves to a new pasture is often easier than sorting and moving individual cow-calf pairs. Also, the workload is partitioned between pasture groups such that cows at risk for dystocia are together in one pasture while calves at risk for diarrhea are in another. Information from pregnancy examination, when available, enables sorting cows into early and later calving groups. Cows expected to calve later in the season can be maintained elsewhere and added to the calving pasture as appropriate, thereby reducing the number of cattle moving through the initial series of pastures.\n\nRanchers using the Sandhills Calving System have observed meaningful and sustained reductions in morbidity and mortality caused by neonatal calf diarrhea and greatly reduced use of medications. 47 Although the system was tested and initially adopted in ranches typical of the Nebraska Sandhills, it has been useful elsewhere because the principles on which it is based are widely applicable.\n\nUnderstanding the multifactorial, temporally dynamic nature of neonatal calf diarrhea in cattle populations is the basis for developing strategies for control and prevention. The common pathogens of neonatal calf diarrhea are endemic to most cattle herds, and it is unlikely that cattle populations could be made biosecure from these agents. Managers of extensive beef cattle systems have few opportunities to improve rates of passive transfer, and vaccines are not always protective. Lactogenic immunity wanes, making calves age susceptible and age infective. Each calf serves as growth media for pathogen production, amplifying the dose-load of pathogen it received and resulting in high calf infectivity and widespread environmental contamination over time in a calving season. For these reasons it is logical to apply biocontainment strategies to prevent effective transmission of the pathogens causing neonatal diarrhea. Cattle management systems based on an understanding of infectious disease dynamics have successfully reduced sickness and death caused by neonatal calf diarrhea."}
