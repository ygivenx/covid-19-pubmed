Xiangyang is the second biggest city in Hubei with a large number of labor-force migrant to Wuhan. At the moment, Xiangyang had many diagnosed cases already. In order to understand the features of COVID-19 in Xiangyang, we conducted a cross-sectional study to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Xiangyang No.1 people's hospital.\n\n.

The current study was approved by the ethics review board at Xiangyang No.1\n\nPeople's Hospital (No. 2020GCP012).\n\nData were extracted by two groups (three physicians per group) from the hospital information system using a consistent data collection protocol and cross-checked. We collected following information: demographic information, exposure history, medical history, principal clinical symptoms and their onset time, real-time RT-PCR results, laboratory findings, radiological findings, comorbidities and disease progression. Laboratory examination included blood routine and blood biochemistry such as alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase isoenzymes-MB (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), \u03b1-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (\u03b1-HBDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and serum ferritin.\n\nPositive real-time RT-PCR was defined as having at least one time of positive result at our hospital or other hospitals.

The mean age was 50.38 (16.86) years old, ranging from 1.5 to 90. The majority of cases fell into the age group of 50-70 years old. Among 71 cases with confirmed contact history, seven were Wuhan residents, 37 had travel history to Wuhan, four contacted with diagnosed patients, and 23 were family-clustered cases. In the analysis of 44 cases with clear contact time, incubation periods ranged from one to twenty days with a mean of 8.09 (4.99) days (Table 1) .\n\nThirty-nine cases (38.2%) had comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, tuberculosis, hepatitis B and chronic bronchitis. Eight cases (7.9%) were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU). Among those, six cases acquired respiratory failure, three developed organ failure and three died. The fatality rate was 3%. After two weeks of treatment, symptoms of seven (7%) patients subsided and CT image showed clear absorption of ground-glass opacity in lungs, negativities detected in two rounds of virus RNA detections. However, they are still being quarantined in case of false negativity.\n\nAll suspected cases were performed with real-time RT-PCR. The next test was performed in other day in cases with negative result. There are 67 (66%) cases with positive results in the first round of test, 21 were found in the second-round with cumulative positivity rate of 86%, 10 were found in the third-round with cumulative positivity rate of 96%, and 2 cases were in the fourth and fifth round, respectively.\n\n.

Fifty-eight (56.9%) cases had cough, mainly dry cough. Ten (9.8%) had white sputum and two (2%) had purulent sputum. Chest X-ray, clinical signs and laboratory examinations indicated that purulent sputum was caused by co-infection with bacteria in lung. Twenty-eight (27.5%) cases showed fatigue and myalgia.

Although strict control measures were taken in Wuhan, Hubei, there were still a large number of new cases every day. Further understanding of the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 is of great importance for the early detection of patients and reduction of severe cases and deaths [12] .\n\nThe present study was based on 102 diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in Xiangyang\n\nNo.1 People's Hospital, Hubei. There was no significant sex difference among our cases with a men-to-women ratio of 1.04 (52:50), which is not in line with previous studies. Huang et al [9] and Chen et al [10] found a higher percentage of men with a men-to-women ratio of 2.71 (30:11) and 2.09 (67:32) in a total of 41 and 99 inpatients, respectively. Discrepancy may be attributed by the differences of the occupational feature between the first-and secondgeneration transmission cases. In Huang et al [9] study, 27 out of 41 patients were directly exposed to the seafood market in Wuhan where was suspected to be the source of infection.\n\nHowever, in Xiangyang area, the patients were mostly secondary cases. In the process of transmission, the sex difference was gradually diluted, indicating that there might be no gender difference in being infected.\n\nSeven cases were imported from Wuhan and 37 had travel history to Wuhan, together accounting for 43% of 102 cases. The rest were secondary transmission cases, among which 23 were family clustering and 31 patients without clear contact history. Compared with previous studies [9, 10] , the main routes of transmission in our cases were different. The family is the fundamental unit of society in China. It is unlikely to avoid close contact without clear diagnosis of the disease, or even if the diagnosis is clear but the patient is not isolated. Based on the family-clustering feature of SARS-CoV-2 infected population in Xiangyang, it is of .

Compared with previous studies [9, 10] , the incubation period of our patients varied more greatly with maximum of 20 days. The prolonged incubation period will increase the risk of virus transmission. According to Diagnosis Guidance for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia the 5 th Edition [11] , individuals with close contact history need to be quarantined for 14 days. The present study suggested that those potential patients were still likely to transmit the virus even after a 14-day quarantine. Real-time RT-RNA testing and medical observation before release should be strengthened and the quarantine time should be extended if necessary.\n\nOnly two cases were under 18 years old (one case with 15 and 1.5 years old), which indicated that people with good health status and immunity were not susceptible. The majority of our patients were 50 to 70 years old with common chronic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, tuberculosis, hepatitis B, chronic bronchitis, etc. Those people have low immunity, organic damage, and decreased body regulation, which may explain the high incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this age group [15] . In addition, disease severity and fatality were higher among the elderly compared with the rest cases. The three deaths in this study were 72, 73 and 78 years old. Among three deaths, one was infected with SARS-CoV-2 after recent lung cancer surgery, one had diabetes, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and hyperthyroidism, and one had hypertension and coronary heart disease [16, 17] . In the absence of cure, it is essential to protect the elderly population, and therefore, to reduce the incidence. Meanwhile, early .

Among 102 patients, the major clinical characteristics were fever (84.3%), cough (56.9%), fatigue (27.5%), etc. Most cases had mild fever (body temperature 37.3 \u2103 -38.5 \u2103) and irritant dry cough. A few patients (12.7%) have a small amount of white frothy sputum and runny nose (2%). In our patients, two cases had diarrhea as the main symptom and 13 cases had diarrhea during the course of the disease. The total incidence of diarrhea and loss of appetite was 15% and 10%, respectively, which differed from previous studies [9, 10] . The disagreement may be caused by the nature of the systemic infection of the virus, the insufficient understanding of the disease.\n\nA recent study reported that ACE-2-expressingcolonocytes are vulnerable for SARS-CoV-2 infections [19] .\n\nThe positive rate of the first throat swabs real-time RT-RNA test in patients was 66%; the cumulative positivity rate in two rounds was 86%, and the cumulative positivity rate in three rounds was 96%. Therefore, the sensitivity of virus RNA test as the main diagnostic method is not high, could be due to the low viral load in upper respiratory tract [20, 21] . In the absence of more sensitive diagnostic methods, we recommend \u22653 repeated molecular tests to increase the diagnostic rate, in order to effectively control transmission.\n\nAccumulative positivity rate of twice chest CT was 98% consistent with real-time RT-PCR, which means the vast majority of patients with positive real-time RT-PCR results will eventually have typical radiological features. In addition, it was not difficult to discern COVID-19 because of its specific radiological abnormalities on chest CT image [22, 23] .\n\n.

A CT reexamination of patients without any clear clinical features at intervals of about 5 days would give a clear radiological sign and thus improved the positive rate of diagnosis.\n\nThe included individuals in this study were all patients with positive real-time RT-PCR results. All of them had different clinical manifestations and 98% had typical radiological findings indicating that real-time RT-PCR detection may be a diagnostic method with a low misdiagnosis rate. However, the positive rate of the first real-time RT-PCR test was only 66%.\n\nThus, the rate of missed diagnosis is relatively high if only use single real-time RT-PCR test [24] . The rate of right diagnosis is 88% for CT examination at the first time and all firsttime diagnosed patients had fever and cough. RNA detection combined with CT at the first diagnosis, along with clinical manifestations can greatly increase the sensitivity and reduce the rate of missed diagnosis. The cumulative positive rate of three times of throat swabs virus RNA tests was 96%, and the cumulative diagnostic coincidence rate of two times CT tests and nucleic acid tests reached 98%. The simultaneous application of two methods can basically detect all potential patients. Based on this, we inferred that \"3+2 \" combined strategy can diagnose most SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, which had great reference value for the diagnosis of \"clinically diagnosed cases\". The application of the \"3+2\" diagnostic method was conducive to the effective control of the source of infection and was a key point to improve SARS-CoV-2 prevention and control.\n\nIt has showed that SARS-CoV-2 is similar with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, using S-protein interacts with human ACE2, thereby infecting human respiratory epithelial cells, causing immune and inflammatory responses, and then producing cytokines and inflammatory mediators, such as IL1\u03b2, IFN\u03b3, IP10, MCP1, et al [25] .

However, concerning the low sensitivity of throat swabs virus RNA detection in previous studies [20, 21, 24] , we speculated that a part of suspected patients or undiagnosed patients might be COVID-19 positive cases. Thus, studies excluding those patients may not actually reflect the real picture of clinical and epidemiological feature of SARS-CoV-2 infected population. Also, accounting for the limited follow-up duration, our data may not reflect the complete course of COVID-19 development. In addition, it is a cross-sectional study with limited ability to infer the causal associations. In the current state of emergency, we hoped that our data-based findings could provide help for disease prevention, control, diagnosis and treatment.\n\n.

The rate of severe illness and death were low, whereas some patients had longer incubation period. We, therefore, recommend prolonging the quarantine period to three weeks when necessary. All patients with positive real-time RT-PCR results had significant clinical symptoms and radiological features, which suggests we could use a combination of real-time RT-PCR, chest CT scans and clinical manifestations on admission to increase the diagnostic accuracy. Sensitivity of three rounds of real-time RT-PCR together with two rounds of chest CT scans was higher compared with other diagnostic methods. Thus, \"3+2\" strategy should be used to increase the accuracy of diagnosis, thereby controlling the source of infection more effectively.\n\n.
