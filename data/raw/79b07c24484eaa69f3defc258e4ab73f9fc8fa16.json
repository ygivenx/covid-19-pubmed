It differs from other respiratory viruses in that it appears that human-tohuman transmission occurs approximately 2 to 10 days prior to the individual becoming symptomatic. [2] [3] [4] The virus is transmitted from person to person through respiratory secretions.\n\nLarge droplets from coughing, sneezing or rhinorrhoea land on surfaces within 2 m of the infected person. SARS-CoV-2 remains viable for at least 24 hours on hard surfaces and up to 8 hours on soft surfaces. 5 The virus is transferred to another person through hand contact on a contaminated surface followed by touching the mouth, nose or eyes. Aerosol airborne infected particles created during a sneeze or cough remain viable in the air for \u2264 3 hours. 5 These airborne particles of SARS-CoV-2 can then be inhaled by another person or land on the mucosal membranes of the eyes.\n\nIndividuals with COVID-19 can present with an influenza-like illness and respiratory tract infection demonstrating fever (89%), cough (68%), fatigue (38%), sputum production (34%) and/or shortness of breath (19%). 4 The spectrum of disease severity ranges from asymptomatic infection or mild upper respiratory tract illness through to severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and/or death. Current reports estimate that 80% of cases are asymptomatic or mild; 15% of cases are severe (infection requiring oxygen); and 5% are critical requiring ventilation and life support. 2 Preliminary reports indicate that chest radiographs may have diagnostic limitations in COVID-19. 6 Clinicians need to be aware that lung computed tomography (CT) scan findings often include multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity. 7 Lung ultrasound is also being used at the bedside with findings of multi-lobar distribution of B-lines and diffuse lung consolidation. 8 The current mortality rate is 3 to 5%, with new reports of up to 9%, which is in contrast to influenza at around 0.1%. 2 The rates of admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) are approximately 5%. 4 Around 42% of patients admitted to hospital will require oxygen therapy. 4 Based on emerging data, individuals at highest risk of developing severe COVID-19\n\ndisease requiring hospitalisation and/or ICU support are those who are older, male, have at least one co-existing comorbidity, higher severity of illness scores (measured via SOFA scores), elevated d-dimer levels and/or lymphocytopaenia. 2, 4, [9] [10] [11] PURPOSE This document has been prepared to provide information to physiotherapists and acute care healthcare facilities about the potential role of physiotherapy in the management of hospitaladmitted patients with confirmed and/or suspected COVID-19.\n\nPhysiotherapists who work in primary healthcare facilities are likely to have a role in the management of patients admitted to hospital with confirmed and/or suspected COVID-19. Physiotherapy is an established profession throughout the world. In Australia and overseas, physiotherapists often work in acute hospital wards and ICUs. In particular, cardiorespiratory physiotherapy focuses on the management of acute and chronic respiratory conditions and aims to improve physical recovery following an acute illness. Physiotherapy may be beneficial in the respiratory treatment and physical rehabilitation of patients with COVID-19.\n\nAlthough a productive cough is a less common symptom (34%), 4 physiotherapy may be indicated if patients with COVID-19 present with copious airway secretions that they are unable to independently clear. This may be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and interventions applied based on clinical indicators. High-risk patients may also benefit, for example: patients with existing comorbidities that may be associated with hypersecretion or ineffective cough (eg, neuromuscular disease, respiratory disease and cystic fibrosis).\n\nPhysiotherapists who practise in the ICU environment may also provide airway clearance techniques for ventilated patients who show signs of inadequate airway clearance and they can assist in positioning patients with severe respiratory failure associated with COVID-19, including the use of prone position to optimise oxygenation. 12 Given the intensive medical management for some COVID-19 patients -including prolonged protective lung ventilation, sedation and use of neuromuscular blocking agents -those who are admitted to ICU may be at high risk of developing ICU-acquired weakness; 13 this may worsen their morbidity and mortality. 14 It is therefore essential to initiate early rehabilitation after the acute phase of respiratory distress in order to limit the severity of ICU-acquired weakness and promote rapid functional recovery. Physiotherapy will have a role in providing exercise, mobilisation and rehabilitation interventions to survivors of critical illness associated with COVID-19 in order to enable a functional return to home. It is recognised that physiotherapy practices vary across the world. When using these recommendations, the scope of practice within the local context should be considered. a endorsements will be updated as they are confirmed. There are also some limitations. Given the recent presentation of COVID-19, clinical guidance may change as more is learnt about the natural history of this disease.\n\nRecommendations were extrapolated based on best evidence for current management of critically ill patients and long-term outcomes in critical illness survivors. No patient was included in the author group. While the recommendations apply to physiotherapy interventions in the acute-care setting, longer-term follow-up of survivors is needed.\n\nCOVID-19 is placing significant demands on healthcare resources throughout the world. Box 1 outlines recommendations to assist the physiotherapy workforce to plan and respond to this demand. It is recommended that staff who are pregnant avoid exposure to COVID-19. It is known that pregnant women are potentially at increased risk of complications from any respiratory disease due to the physiological changes that occur in pregnancy. There is not enough currently available information on the impact of COVID-19 on a pregnant woman or her baby.\n\nWorkforce planning should include consideration for pandemic-specific requirements such as additional workload from donning and doffing PPE, and the need to allocate staff to key non-clinical duties such as enforcing infection control procedures. 12 1.10 Consider organising the workforce into teams that will manage COVID-19 versus noninfectious patients. Minimise or prevent movement of staff between teams. Liaise with local infection control services for recommendations.\n\n1.11 Be aware of and comply with relevant international, national, state and/or hospital guidelines for infection control in healthcare facilities. For example, World Health Organization 'Guidelines for infection prevention and control during health care when novel coronavirus infection is suspected'. 19 1.12 Senior physiotherapists should be involved in determining the appropriateness of physiotherapy interventions for patients with suspected and/or proven COVID-19 in consultation with senior medical staff and according to a referral guideline.\n\n1.13 Identify hospital-wide plans for allocation/cohorting patients with COVID-19. Utilise these plans to prepare resource plans that may be required. For example, Table 2 below is an example of a resource plan for ICU physiotherapy.\n\n1.14 Identify additional physical resources that may be required for physiotherapy interventions and how the risk of cross-infection can be minimised (eg, respiratory equipment; mobilisation, exercise and rehabilitation equipment; and equipment storage).\n\n1.15 Identify and develop a facility inventory of respiratory, mobilisation, exercise and rehabilitation equipment and determine the process of equipment allocation as pandemic levels increase (ie, to prevent movement of equipment between infectious and noninfectious areas).\n\n1.16 It should be recognised that staff will likely have an increased workload with a heightened risk of anxiety both at work and home. 12 Staff should be supported during and beyond the active treatment phases (eg, via access to employee assistance programs, counselling and facilitated debriefing sessions). The respiratory infection associated with COVID-19 is mostly associated with a dry and non-productive cough; lower respiratory tract involvement usually involves pneumonitis rather than exudative consolidation. 20 In these cases, respiratory physiotherapy interventions are not indicated.\n\nRespiratory physiotherapy interventions in hospital wards or ICU may be indicated for patients who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and concurrently or subsequently develop exudative consolidation, mucous hypersecretion and/or difficulty clearing secretions.\n\nPhysiotherapists will have an ongoing role in providing interventions for mobilisation, exercise and rehabilitation (eg, in patients with comorbidities creating significant functional decline and/or (at risk) for ICU-acquired weakness).\n\nPhysiotherapy interventions should only be provided when there are clinical indicators, so that staff exposure to patients with COVID-19 is minimised. Unnecessary review of patients with COVID-19 within their isolation room/areas will also have a negative impact on PPE supplies.\n\nPhysiotherapists should meet regularly with senior medical staff to determine indications for physiotherapy review in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 and screen according to set/agreed guidelines (Table 1 provides a suggested framework).\n\nPhysiotherapy staff should not be routinely entering isolation rooms, where patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are isolated or cohorted, just to screen for referrals.\n\nOptions for screening patients via subjective review and basic assessment whilst not being in direct contact with the patient should be trialled first whenever possible (eg, calling the patient's isolation room telephone and conducting a subjective assessment for mobility information and/or providing education on airway clearance techniques). \n\nIt is important for physiotherapists to be aware of the medical management for patients with COVID-19. Table 3 summarises some of the recommendations available from medical guidelines developed by professional societies (as listed in Appendix 2).\n\nFor patients admitted to ICU, additional strategies may be used; these are summarised in Table 3 Specific interventions.\n\nAerosolgenerating procedures\n\nThe following procedures create an airborne risk of transmission of COVID-19:\n\n\u2022 intubation/extubation \u2022 bronchoscopy \u2022 high-flow nasal oxygen use \u2022 non-invasive ventilation \u2022 tracheostomy \u2022 cardiopulmonary resuscitation prior to intubation 12, 22 Additional aerosol-generating procedures related to physiotherapy techniques are outlined below.\n\nThis is a recommended therapy for hypoxia associated with COVID-19, as long as staff are wearing optimal airborne PPE. 12 At flow rates 40 to 60 l/min, high-flow nasal oxygen does carry a small risk of aerosol generation. The risk of airborne transmission to staff is low when optimal PPE and other infection control precautions are being used. 23 Negative pressure rooms are preferable for patients receiving high-flow nasal oxygen. 12 Respiratory support via high-flow nasal oxygen should be restricted to patients in airborne isolation rooms only. Limiting the flow rate to no more than 30 l/min might reduce potential viral transmission.\n\nRoutine use is not recommended 12 because current experience with COVID-19 hypoxic respiratory failure has a high associated failure rate. If used (eg, with a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or post-extubation), it must be provided with strict airborne PPE. 12 Oxygen therapy Treatment targets may vary depending on the presentation of the patient.\n\n\u2022 For patients presenting with severe respiratory distress, hypoxaemia or shock, SpO 2 > 94% is targeted. 23 \u2022 Once a patient is stable, the SpO 2 target is > 90% in non-pregnant adults 24 and 92 to 95% in pregnant patients. 23 \u2022 In adults with COVID-19 and acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure, the SpO 2 target should not be maintained > 96%. 22 \n\nThe use of nebulised agents (eg, salbutamol, saline) for the treatment of non-intubated patients with COVID-19 is not recommended because it increases the risk of aerosolisation and transmission of infection to healthcare workers in the immediate vicinity.\n\nUse of metered-dose inhalers or spacers is preferred where possible. 12 If a nebuliser is required, liaise with local guidelines for directions to minimise aerosolisation (eg, use of a Pari Sprint with inline viral filter).\n\nUse of nebulisers, non-invasive ventilation, high-flow nasal oxygen and spirometry should be avoided and agreement to their use sought from senior medical staff. 20 If deemed essential, airborne precautions should be used.\n\nCOVID-19 = Coronavirus Disease 2019, FTE = full-time equivalent, HDU = high dependency unit, ICU = intensive care unit, PPE = personal protective equipment, SpO 2 = oxyhaemoglobin saturation Table 4 Additional interventions in the ICU.\n\nPatients with worsening hypoxia, hypercapnia, acidaemia, respiratory fatigue, haemodynamic instability or those with altered mental status should be considered for early invasive mechanical ventilation if appropriate. 12 The risk of aerosol transmission is reduced once a patient is intubated with a closed ventilator circuit. 12\n\nAlthough current evidence does not support the routine use of recruitment manoeuvres in non-COVID- 19 Prone positioning Anecdotal reports from international centres dealing with large numbers of critically ill patients with COVID-19-related ARDS suggest that prone ventilation is an effective strategy in mechanically ventilated patients. 12 In adult patients with COVID-19 and severe ARDS, prone ventilation for 12 to 16 hours per day is recommended. 22 \n\nExamples of physiotherapy-led respiratory interventions (or chest physiotherapy) are provided below.\n\nAirway clearance techniques include positioning, active cycle of breathing, manual and/or ventilator hyperinflation, percussion and vibrations, positive expiratory pressure therapy (PEP) and mechanical insufflation-exsufflation.\n\nPhysiotherapists may use inspiratory positive pressure breathing (eg, for patients with rib fractures). Non-invasive ventilation may be applied as part of airway clearance strategies in the management of respiratory failure or during exercise.\n\nTechniques to facilitate secretion clearance include assisted or stimulated cough manoeuvres and airway suctioning.\n\nPhysiotherapists prescribe exercise and assist patients to mobilise. Physiotherapists also play an integral role in the management of patients with a tracheostomy.\n\nCOVID-19 poses significant considerations for respiratory physiotherapy interventions due to their aerosol-generating procedures. Box 3 outlines recommendations for providing During techniques that may provoke a cough, education should be provided to enhance cough etiquette and hygiene.\n\n\u2022 Ask patient to cover their cough by coughing into their elbow or sleeve or into a tissue. Tissues should then be disposed and hand hygiene performed. treatments. Physiotherapists should weigh up the risk versus benefit to completing these interventions and use airborne precautions.\n\nWhere aerosol-generating procedures are indicated and considered essential they should be undertaken in a negative-pressure room, if available, or in a single room with the door closed. Only the minimum number of required staff should be present and they must all wear PPE, as described. Entry and exit from the room should be minimised during the procedure. 12 This may not be able to be maintained when cohorting is required because of the volume of patients presenting with COVID-19.\n\n3.5 BubblePEP is not recommended for patients with COVID-19 because of uncertainty around the potential for aerosolisation, which is similar to the caution the WHO places on bubble CPAP. 23 \n\nThere is no evidence for incentive spirometry in patients with COVID-19.\n\nAvoid the use of mechanical insufflation/exsufflation, non-invasive ventilation, inspiratory positive pressure breathing devices or high-flow nasal oxygen devices. However, if clinically indicated and alternative options have been ineffective, consult with both senior medical staff and Infection Prevention and Monitoring Services within local facilities prior to use. If used, ensure that machines can be decontaminated after use and protect machines with viral filters over machine and patient ends of circuits.\n\n\u2022 Use disposable circuits for these devices \u2022 Maintain a log for devices that includes patient details for tracking and infection monitoring (if required) \u2022 Use airborne precautions 3.8\n\nWhere respiratory equipment is used, whenever possible, use single-patient-use disposable options (eg, single-patient-use PEP devices).\n\nRe-usable respiratory equipment should be avoided where possible.\n\nPhysiotherapists should not implement humidification, non-invasive ventilation or other aerosol-generating procedures without consultation and agreement with a senior doctor (eg, medical consultant).\n\nSputum inductions should not be performed.\n\nRequests for sputum samples 3.11\n\nIn the first instance, ascertain whether the patient is productive of sputum and able to clear sputum independently. If so, physiotherapy is not required for a sputum sample.\n\nIf physiotherapy interventions are required to facilitate a sputum sample, full airborne PPE should be worn. The handling of sputum samples should adhere to local policies. Generally, once a sputum sample has been obtained the following points should be followed:\n\n\u2022 All sputum specimens and request forms should be marked with a biohazard label.\n\n\u2022 The specimen should be double-bagged. The specimen should be placed in the first bag in the isolation room by a staff member wearing recommended PPE. \u2022 Specimens should be hand-delivered to the laboratory by someone who understands the nature of the specimens. Pneumatic tube systems must not be used to transport specimens.\n\nSaline nebulisation 3.12 Do not use saline nebulisation. It should be noted that some UK guidelines allow use of nebulisers, but this is currently not recommended in Australia.\n\nAs it involves disconnection/opening of a ventilator circuit, avoid manual hyperinflation and utilise ventilator hyperinflation if indicated (eg, for suppurative presentations in ICU and if local procedures are in place).\n\nPositioning, including gravity-assisted drainage 3.14 Physiotherapists can continue to advise on positioning requirements for patients. Physiotherapists are responsible for providing musculoskeletal, neurological and cardiopulmonary rehabilitation tasks, as outlined below.\n\nPassive, active-assisted, active or resisted joint range of motion exercises may be performed to maintain or improve joint integrity, range of motion and muscle strength.\n\nExamples of mobilisation and rehabilitation include bed mobility, sitting out of bed, sitting balance, sit to stand, walking, tilt table, standing hoists, upper/lower limb ergometry and exercise programs.\n\nBox 4 outlines recommendations for implementing these activities in patients with COVID-19.\n\nIt is imperative that physiotherapists understand the measures in place to prevent transmission of COVID-19. Box 5 provides recommendations for this. Patients with presumed or confirmed COVID-19 will be managed with either droplet or airborne precautions. 12 Additionally, they will be placed in isolation. and rehabilitation in most circumstances. However, physiotherapists are likely to be in close contact with the patient (eg, for mobilisation, exercise or rehabilitation interventions that require assistance). In these cases, consider use of a high filtration mask (eg, P2/N95). Mobilisation and exercise may also result in the patient coughing or expectorating mucus, and there may be circuit disconnections with ventilated patients.\n\nRefer to local guidelines regarding ability to mobilise patients outside of their isolation room. If mobilising outside of the isolation room, ensure that the patient is wearing a surgical mask.\n\nPhysiotherapists will actively screen and/or accept referrals for mobilisation, exercise and rehabilitation.\n\nWhen screening, discussion with nursing staff, the patient (eg, via phone) or family is recommended before deciding to enter the patient's isolation room. For example, to try to minimise staff who come in to contact with patients with COVID-19, physiotherapists may screen to determine an appropriate aid to trial. A trial of the aid may then be performed by the nursing staff already in an isolation room, with guidance provided, if needed, by the physiotherapist who is outside the room.\n\nDirect physiotherapy interventions should only be considered when there are significant functional limitations, such as (risk for) ICU-acquired weakness, frailty, multiple comorbidities and advanced age.\n\nEarly mobilisation is encouraged. Actively mobilise the patient early in the course of illness when safe to do so. 23 4.5 Patients should be encouraged to maintain function, as able within their rooms.\n\n\u2022 Sit out of bed \u2022 Perform simple exercises and activities of daily living Mobilisation and exercise prescription 4.6 Mobilisation and exercise prescription should involve careful consideration of the patient's state (eg, stable clinical presentation with stable respiratory and haemodynamic function). 26, 27 Mobility and exercise equipment 4.7\n\nThe use of equipment should be carefully considered and discussed with local infection monitoring and prevention service staff before being used with patients with COVID-19 to ensure that it can be properly decontaminated.\n\nUse equipment that can be single patient use. For example, use elastic resistance bands rather than distributing hand weights.\n\nLarger equipment (eg, mobility aids, ergometers, chairs and tilt tables) must be easily decontaminated. Avoid use of specialised equipment, unless necessary, for basic \n\n'Fit testing' is recommended when available, but the evidence for fit testing effectiveness is limited and the variation in supply of N95 mask types may make any recommendation on fit testing difficult to implement from a practical perspective. 12 \n\nStaff with beards should be encouraged to remove facial hair to ensure good mask fit. 24 \n\nFor all suspected and confirmed cases, droplet precautions should be implemented, at a minimum. Staff must wear the following items:\n\n\u2022 surgical mask \u2022 fluid-resistant long-sleeved gown \u2022 goggles or face shield \u2022 gloves 22\n\nRecommended PPE for staff caring for COVID-19-infected patients includes added precautions for patients with significant respiratory illness, when aerosol-generating procedures are likely and/or prolonged or very close contact with the patient is likely. In these cases, airborne precautions are followed, including:\n\n\u2022 an N95/P2 mask \u2022 fluid-resistant long-sleeved gown \u2022 goggles or face shield \u2022 gloves 24 5.6 In addition, the following can be considered:\n\n\u2022 hair cover for aerosol-generating procedures \u2022 shoes that are impermeable to liquids and can be wiped down Recurrent use of shoe covers is not recommended, as repeated removal is likely to increase the risk of staff contamination. 12 5.7 PPE must remain in place and be worn correctly for the duration of exposure to potentially contaminated areas. PPE (particularly masks) should not be adjusted during patient care. 24 5.8 Use a step-by-step process for donning and doffing PPE as per local guidelines. 24 \n\nCheck local guidelines for information on laundering uniforms and/or wearing uniforms outside of work if exposed to COVID-19. For example, changing into scrubs may be recommended in local guidelines 12 and/or staff may be encouraged to get changed out of their uniform before leaving work and to transport worn uniforms home in a plastic bag for washing at home. Stethoscope use should be minimised. 12 If required, use dedicated stethoscopes within isolation areas. 19, 23 Hair should be tied back out of the face and eyes. 24 5.11 Staff caring for infectious patients must apply correct PPE, irrespective of physical isolation. 5.12 When a unit is caring for a patient with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, it is recommended that all donning and doffing are supervised by an additional appropriately trained staff member. 12 5.13 Avoid sharing equipment. Preferably only use single-use equipment.\n\n5.14 Wear an additional plastic apron if high volumes of fluid exposure is expected. 24 5.15 If reusable PPE items are used (eg, goggles), these must be cleaned and disinfected prior to re-use. 24 COVID-19 = Coronavirus Disease 2019, ICU = intensive care unit, PPE = personal protective equipment Footnotes: a An international team of expert researchers and clinicians within the intensive care and acute cardiorespiratory fields have developed these recommendations.
