{"title": "Emotional Acceptance, Inflammation, and Sickness Symptoms Across the First Two Years Following Breast Cancer Diagnosis HHS Public Access", "body": "Breast cancer, its treatment, and the associated emotional experiences can influence immune system activity (1) . Malignant tumor cells and immune cells at the site of the tumor can secrete proinflammatory and immune activating cytokines, creating the systemic paraneoplastic immune response now documented as a consistent pattern in cancer, including increases in macrophage infiltrating factor, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-18, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 (2) . Additionally, cancer treatments such as radiation therapy and chemotherapy can stimulate the immune system to produce proinflammatory cytokines (3) . Furthermore, the threats to a woman's goals from breast cancer generate strong and persistent negative emotions, which are associated with inflammatory activity through autonomic and hormonal pathways, as well as behavioral pathways such as poor sleep quality (4 -7) .\n\nHeightened proinflammatory activity can, in turn, induce symptoms such as feeling physically ill, fatigued, and experiencing pain (8 -10) . This constellation of symptoms is known as \"sickness behavior\" and is thought to reflect an adaptive, acute phase state in which the body mounts an organized biological response to defend against a pathogenic threat (9 , 11 , 12) . Sickness behaviors, in turn, can increase inflammatory responses in the body (6) , ultimately forming a vicious inflammation-sickness cycle. Although sickness behavior is believed to be an adaptive response to infectious agents, it may be detrimental in cancer patients when activation of the peripheral immune system and/or emotional distress continues unabated and exacerbates the inflammation-sickness cycle, ultimately taxing the person's resources (13) . Sickness behavior in animal models parallels symptom expression in cancer patients, including physical symptoms such as pain, nausea, wasting/cachexia, and fatigue (11) . Inflammation and symptoms associated with sickness behavior can have profound effects on patients' lives; interrupting this cycle could improve the quality of life and, potentially, the survival of breast cancer patients (14 -17) .\n\nThe present study focuses on effective emotion regulation as one way to attenuate this vicious cycle. Emotion regulation is the process by which individuals influence which emotions they have, when they have them, and how they experience and express them (18) . Emotion regulation can occur before (\"antecedent\" focused), during, or after (consequent-focused) an emotional response has been generated (19) . Effective emotion regulation, whereby individuals regulate their emotions in a way that supports their goals and maintains physiological equilibrium, may buffer against the psychological and physiological consequences of emotional distress related to breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, while ineffective regulation may exacerbate it (20 -22) .\n\nEmotional acceptance (EA) is an important emotion regulation process that involves a willingness to feel both positive and negative emotions and to allow emotions to develop and dissipate without attempts to control, change, or reject them (23) . In breast cancer patients, EA is related to lower distress (23 -25) , fewer depressive symptoms (26) , and increased positive benefit finding (i.e., perceived positive changes and experiences, including, for example, greater purpose in life and closer relationships) (27) . Importantly, EA is also associated with increased survival following breast cancer diagnosis (17) . Little is known, however, of the role that EA may play in the inflammation-sickness cycle in which inflammatory cytokines contribute to feelings of sickness and fatigue.\n\nThe purpose of the current study, therefore, was to conduct a secondary data analysis to examine whether emotional acceptance alters the association between proinflammatory cytokines and sickness symptoms in women with breast cancer. We hypothesized that higher levels of circulating cytokines would be associated with more sickness symptoms, but these associations would be attenuated at high levels of emotional acceptance. Put another way, higher levels of emotional acceptance will moderate the association between inflammation and sickness symptoms in breast cancer patients.\n\nin the treatment trajectory. However, at each time point/visit, participants reported whether or not they had received chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment sometime during the 3 months prior (i.e., since the last time point assessed). Breast cancer treatment information and comorbid medical diagnoses were obtained from medical chart review at the end of data collection for each subject. Supplemental material presented in Table 3 describes additional information regarding the clinical sample and characteristics of breast cancer treatment.\n\nWe incorporated both a between-person and within-person perspective to assess how, on average, cytokines and emotional acceptance were associated with sickness symptoms, as well as how women's fluctuations over time in cytokines and emotional acceptance, relative to their own means, were associated with their sickness symptoms (28 -30) . Thus, for each woman, we calculated her mean level of cytokines and emotional acceptance by averaging her values for that variable across all of her time points. We also calculated person-centered values of each woman's cytokines and emotional acceptance by subtracting her mean value for that variable from each of her individual observations (at each time point) for that variable. Thus, any individual time point lower than the woman's mean value would have a person-centered value less than zero, and any time point higher than the woman's mean value would have a person-centered value greater than zero.\n\nWell-Being Scale (FACT-PWB) assessed sickness symptoms and their effects on physical functioning (31) . The scale includes the following 7 items: \"I have a lack of energy\", \"I have nausea\", \"I feel sick\", \"Because of my physical condition, I have trouble meeting the needs of my family\", \"I have pain\", \"I am bothered by the side effects of treatment\", and \"I am forced to spend time in bed.\" Responses ranged from 0 for \"not at all\" to 4 for \"very much.\" Higher scores (sum of 7 responses, range 0-28) indicate more sickness symptoms, and a change of \u2265 1.8-points in the overall level of this scale (i.e., not in the person-centered context) is considered clinically significant (32) . Previous research has demonstrated that the sickness behavior cluster, including symptoms addressed by this scale (e.g., pain, lack of energy, etc.), can be used as a framework to explain many of the symptoms associated with cancer and cancer treatment (11 , 16 , 33) . Nevertheless, sickness behavior is a broadly defined term that includes symptoms, experiences, and impact on functioning; the current study focused more specifically on symptoms associated with physical functioning. In the current study, the internal reliability of the total sickness symptoms scores over time (indicative of reliability between participants) was high ( coefficient = 0.89). Internal reliability of the person-centered sickness symptoms scores over time (indicative of reliability within participants) was also good ( coefficient = 0.79). such as, \"I naturally and easily attend to my feelings,\" \"I allow myself to be in touch with my feelings because it is very good for me\", and \"Knowing they are 'not perfect', I am comfortable with my feelings as they are.\" Participants indicate the percentage of time they believe the statement is true for themselves, ranging from 0 for \"never\" to 100 for \"almost always.\" The total score is the average for the 13 items (range 0 -100) and higher scores indicate more emotional acceptance. In the current study, the internal reliability of the mean emotional acceptance scores over time (indicative of reliability between participants) was high ( coefficient = 0.97). Internal reliability of the person-centered emotional acceptance scores over time (indicative of reliability within participants) was also high ( coefficient = 0.87).\n\nInflammatory cytokines-Plasma samples were collected from EDTA-treated whole blood at each study visit, and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until assayed; all time points for an individual subject were assayed together in the same 96-well plate to minimize the effects of inter-assay variability. As previously described (34) , circulating levels of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 were assayed with a high sensitivity bead-based multiplex assay (R&D Systems) with a Bio-Plex 200 (Luminex) Instrument, Bio-Plex software v4.1, and a 5-parameter logistic curve fit. All multiplex assays were performed on plasma samples diluted 2-fold according to the manufacturer's protocol, and all calculated concentrations generated by the BioPlex Manager software were included in data analyses. This R&D Systems multiplex assay has been shown to have excellent intra-and inter-assay reproducibility in a recent temporal stability study of circulating cytokine levels (35) and very strong correlations (r \u2265 .94) across a wide range of concentrations with high sensitivity ELISA kits from the same manufacturer (36) . Due to the strength of the parent study design, which utilized up to nine repeated measures of cytokine values for each subject, each time point was evaluated in a single determination. The lower limit of detection was defined as the lowest calculated value obtained on any sample (0.4 and 0.5 pg/mL for IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1, respectively, and 0.1 pg/mL for all others); calculated concentrations <0.1 pg/mL were considered below the limit of detection (35) . Due to the low percentage of IFN-\u03b3 (47%), IL-2 (75%), and IL-1\u03b2 (77%) with detectable levels, as well as the low IL-2 and IL-1\u03b2 concentrations of the samples that were detectable, these biomarkers were excluded from the data analyses. Table 2 presents detectability information and descriptive statistics on cytokines included in analyses (i.e., IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-10). Samples with undetectable values for IL-6 and IL-10 were substituted with one-half the concentration of the minimum calculated value per analyte, per plate. Depending on the plate, substituted values ranged from 0.08 -0.27 pg/mL for IL-6 (2% of values) and from 0.05 -0.12 pg/mL for IL-10 (10% of values). No samples were undetectable for TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8. Using these value substitutions is more appropriate than treating the samples with undetectable values as missing at random (37) . Immune variables were natural log-transformed before analyses. For tables and figures, immune data have been back-transformed to original values and, in the case of person-centered immune data, expressed as a difference from the mean.\n\nFunctional Comorbidity Index (FCI) (38) quantifies the number of chronic medical conditions for each subject. It was developed and validated for use to adjust for comorbid disease in epidemiologic studies in which physical function is an outcome measure. The index quantifies the total number of the following sixteen categories of medical conditions: 1) arthritis (rheumatoid and osteoarthritis); 2) osteoporosis; 3) asthma; 4) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acquired respiratory distress syndrome, or emphysema; 5) angina; 6) congestive heart failure (or heart disease); 7) heart attack; 8) neurological disease (such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's); 9) stroke or TIA; 10) peripheral vascular disease; 11) diabetes types I and II; 12) upper gastrointestinal disease (ulcer, hernia, reflux); 13) visual impairment (cataract, glaucoma, macular degeneration); 14) hearing impairment (very hard of hearing, even with hearing aids); 15) degenerative disc disease; and 16) obesity (body mass index >30). Other medical conditions associated with inflammation not captured in this index for one or more of the participants in the current study (as indicated) included: Sjogren's syndrome, psoriasis (n=2), inflammatory bowel disease, sarcoidosis, and iritis.\n\nDemographic characteristics-Age, education, ethnicity, race, and marital status were assessed (Table 1 ). Marital status was characterized according to first versus subsequent marriage, in addition to the usual categories. This is based on recent findings that individuals who experienced relationship disruption, such as a divorce, reported worse health including 20% more chronic conditions compared to individuals who remained in their first marriage (39); Although remarriage was better for health than other types of relationship statuses (e.g. remaining unmarried), the authors concluded that \"those who married once and remained married are consistently, strongly, and broadly advantaged\" ((39 ) ( 39 )( 39)p. 356).\n\nTables 1 and 2 present descriptive information for all study variables. To test our hypothesis, we used multilevel models to account for the repeated measures nested within individuals. We implemented the models with the lme function from the nlme package (version 3.1-118) in R (version 3.0.3). A maximum likelihood estimation procedure and unstructured matrix for the random components were specified in all of the models. Within-person residuals were treated as identical and independently distributed. Analyses first established the functional form over time of the dependent variable (sickness symptoms) and identified related covariates of sickness symptoms. Next, we included the between-person predictors (mean cytokines and mean emotional acceptance) and the within-person predictors (personcentered cytokines and person-centered emotional acceptance) in the models as fixed effects.\n\nTo establish the functional form across time for the dependent variable (sickness symptoms), we started with a model that included the intercept, linear, quadratic, and cubic time as both fixed and random effects, but the model did not converge. Removing the random effect of cubic time allowed for convergence, thus, in the final model it was only included as a fixed effect. Next, we examined demographic and treatment variables (age, ethnicity, education, relationship status, race, comorbidity, current disease stage, cancer treatment type, time-varying chemotherapy and radiation treatment occasions, and time between diagnosis and initial assessment) in separate models as predictors of sickness symptoms. Those that either had main effects, or interacted with linear, quadratic, or cubic time were included as controls in subsequent models.\n\nPredictive models-After determining the functional form, we estimated separate models to test associations of mean or person-centered cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, or TNF-\u03b1 values), predicting sickness symptoms over time, moderated by mean or personcentered emotional acceptance. All between-person models (i.e., mean level predictors) also controlled for person-centered levels of cytokines and emotional acceptance, and all withinperson models (i.e., person-centered predictors) also controlled for mean levels of cytokines and emotional acceptance.\n\nThe Level 1 equation for the predictive model is represented below. 1 The \"pc\" variables refer to the person-centered (or within-person) versions of the variables. The \"mean\" variables refer to the mean (or between-person) versions of the variables.\n\nThe Level 2 equation for the predictive model is presented below. The intercept, linear time, and quadratic time were estimated as random effects and improved model fit.\n\nMissingness at any time point (i.e., visits 1-9) was not predicted by cancer treatment, cancer stage, age, nor mean levels of EA, interleukin (IL)-8, IL-10, or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1. However, missingness was predicted by mean levels of sickness symptoms (i.e., a oneunit increase in self-reported sickness symptoms was associated with 17% increase in the odds of being missing), and by mean levels of IL-6 (i.e., a one-unit increase in natural-log transfored-IL-6, or a 2.72 increase in IL-6 pg/mL, was associated with a 94% increase in the odds of being missing). Rather than biasing results in an undesirable way, this pattern of missingness makes it less likely for us to find support for our hypotheses, due to the restricted range on the key variables.\n\nThe 002; i.e., married women in their first marriage reported significantly lower sickness symptoms than divorced women). No other demographic and treatment variables were significantly associated with sickness symptoms. 2 Continuous variables were centered around their respective means for inclusion in models. For a given woman, time-points with higher than her average IL-6 and IL-8 values were associated with more self-reported sickness symptoms for that woman, compared to her average sickness symptoms: IL-6 (b=0. 44 \n\nThere was no significant change in EA over time, however there was variability in EA both between participants and from time to time (intra-class correlation: 0.76). Mean level EA did not significantly predict sickness symptoms (b = 0.00, 95% CI [\u22120.027, 0.032], t(125) = 0.16, p = .87), but person-centered EA did (b = \u22120.02, 95% CI [\u22120.047, \u22120.001], t(815) = \u22122.06, p = .039). For a given woman, time-points with higher than average EA values were associated with lower sickness symptoms for that woman, compared to her average sickness symptoms.\n\nTo provide a sense of relative magnitude of effects, we report both unstandardized (b) and standardized betas (B) for the simple slopes involved in significant interactions and provide interpretations in original scale units. All significant interactions were probed using the 25 th percentile for low levels of the variables and 75 th percentile for the high levels of the variables, following methods outlined by Aiken and West (40).\n\nEA significantly moderated the association between mean IL-8 and sickness symptoms (b=.06, 95% CI [0.020, 0.103], t(83) = 2.90, p= .005). As shown in Figure 2 , when average EA was high, overall IL-8 levels correlated with sickness symptoms (b = 1.75, B= .19, p= .040). A 1 SD decrease in mean IL-8 was associated with a 0.9 unit decrease (18%, given the 5-point scale) in sickness symptoms for women reporting high mean EA. In contrast, women reporting low mean EA had persistently high sickness symptoms regardless of mean IL-8 levels (b = .15, B= .02, p= .81). given woman, higher than average IL-8 ( Figure 3 ) and TNF-\u03b1 ( Figure 4 ), relative to her own cytokine means, were associated with higher than average sickness symptoms at times when her emotional acceptance was lower than average (IL-8: b = 1.34, B=.10, p= .000; TNF-\u03b1: b = 1.20, B= .06, p = .032). However, cytokines and sickness symptoms were not associated at times when her emotional acceptance was higher than average. In terms of magnitude of effects, when women reported lower than their own average EA, a 1 SD increase in their cytokine level was associated with a 0.5 unit increase (9%, given the 5-point scale) in sickness symptoms for IL-8, and 0.3 unit increase (6% given the 5-point scale) in sickness symptoms for TNF-\u03b1. When women reported higher than average EA, sickness symptoms were not significantly associated with person-centered IL-8 (b=.73, B=.054, p=.057), nor TNF-\u03b1 (b= .05, B= .003, p= .93); a 1 SD increase in the person-centered cytokine was associated with a 0.3 unit change (5% given the 5-point scale) in sickness symptoms for IL-8, but only a 0.01 unit change (0.3% given the 5-point scale) in sickness symptoms for TNF-\u03b1.\n\nThis study confirms previous reports that biomarkers of increased inflammation, specifically proinflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 and the inflammation-associated chemokine IL-8, are associated with sickness behaviors (e.g., feeling physically ill) in women with breast cancer (1 , 3) . More importantly for the hypotheses of this study, these data provide the first evidence that emotional acceptance attenuates these associations; at time points when a given woman increases her acceptance of emotion as compared to her usual functioning, the association between inflammatory biomarkers and sickness behaviors is no longer present. Consistent with our hypothesis, variation in EA moderated the linkage of IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 with sickness symptoms at certain times. In other words, when emotional acceptance dropped below average for a given woman, higher levels of IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 at that time point were associated with more self-reported sickness symptoms. In contrast, when emotional acceptance increased above average, there was no association between IL-8 or TNF-\u03b1 and sickness symptoms. This variability in the coupling of IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 and sickness symptoms suggests a novel mechanism through which a feedback loop of stressinducing sickness behaviors and inflammation might be interrupted.\n\nThe within-person results (i.e., variation of the inflammatory biomarker/sickness symptom linkage at different time points) reflect changes from a woman's average level of EA. However, these results occurred in the context of a different pattern of associations at the average levels of IL-8. Average sickness symptoms were high in subjects whose EA was persistently low, regardless of their average levels of IL-8. These results are consistent with the well-documented association of low EA and negative mood (22) , which is known to perpetuate sickness symptoms (41) . Low average EA perpetuated sickness symptoms after accounting for the linked covariation of IL-8 and symptoms, but this linkage of low average EA with higher average symptoms seems to have remained suppressed by the stronger influence of average TNF-\u03b1 on average symptom levels. These results should be interpreted with caution, however, because mean levels of EA were not associated with sickness symptoms overall and the association of sickness symptoms with the mean level of TNF-\u03b1 was not moderated by EA. Additional research is needed to compare and contrast the influences of emotion regulation and proinflammatory cytokines, and their interaction, on sickness symptoms.\n\nOverall, IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1, but not IL-6 increased over the year following breast cancer diagnosis in this sample. For TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8, these results and the parallel increases of their average levels with average sickness symptoms are consistent with previous reports (42 , 43) . Additionally, breast cancer tumor cells produce IL-8 (2). IL-8 is an activator and chemoattractant for neutrophils and activated neutrophils release a cascade of inflammatory cytokines, suggesting a chain of tumor secretion of IL-8 to increased inflammation. The lack of increase in average IL-6 for breast cancer patients is not consistent with the majority of studies, although other null results have been reported (44) . The 94% increased likelihood of missing data for subjects with high levels of IL-6 at their sampled time points may have contributed to this outcome.\n\nA number of plausible behavioral, psychological, and physiological mechanisms may help to explain why effective emotion regulation may attenuate this vicious cycle, whereas ineffective regulation could exacerbate it (45) . The ability to regulate emotions effectively may contribute to fewer disruptions in goal-directed behavior, including health-promoting behaviors (46 , 47) . (However, emotion regulation strategies that are typically considered as effective, such as emotional acceptance, may not be as adaptive in circumstances in which they prevent resources from being used that could help to manage a controllable illness.) Additionally, failure to appropriately regulate strong or persistent negative emotions may hinder cognitive-emotional functioning and contribute to depressive symptoms (48 ) ( 49) , which are known to be associated with greater sickness symptoms. Furthermore, ineffective emotion regulation may also directly disrupt biological functioning, including contributing to decreased parasympathetic nervous system activity, along with heighted activity in the sympathetic nervous system, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and immune system (50 -53) . The findings from the present study help to clarify the role of emotional acceptance, and emotion regulation more broadly, in potentially mitigating the vicious inflammationsickness cycle that breast cancer patients may experience.\n\nLastly, in the present study, we focus on emotional acceptance as an effective emotion regulation strategy to attenuate the effects of inflammation on sickness symptoms. However, inflammation and sickness symptoms may also be antecedents of emotional acceptance and other forms of emotion regulation, thus creating a circular, bi-directional process. Although the present study focused on one part of the cycle in which emotional acceptance is effective in a shorter time frame at downregulating the effects of inflammation on sickness symptoms, we found some support for the circularity of these associations. 2 Interventions such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) (54) and Barlow's Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (55) have been demonstrated to increase emotional acceptance in conjunction with decreasing experiential avoidance (56 , 57) . A recent meta-analysis of ACT found it to be effective for reduction of somatic complaints in an analysis of 15 studies with 683 participants (Hedges' g = 0.58, SE =0.13, 95% CI: 0.33-0.84, p < 0.001) (58) . Experimental medicine interventions to test therapies to increase acceptance of emotion are important future steps for testing the mechanisms by which emotion regulation may be effective in uncoupling the linkage of inflammation and sickness behavior.\n\nStrengths of the current study include the within-person design, which is similar to a timeseries design used in quasi-experimental studies, only sans manipulation of an independent variable, as well as the use of a multiplex immunoassay. Although enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the most widely used and best validated method for measuring cytokines, it is limited due to only being able to measure a single protein at a time (59) . An important part of the process in the current study was to determine which cytokines were detectable and told a coherent story. For example, IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, and IL-1\u03b2 were not used in analyses due to a low percentage of detectable values. In a recent study that used the multiplex immunoassay of cytokines in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, Cheung and colleagues (60) found a substantial portion of IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 concentrations were also below the detection limit. Additionally, a previous study using the same multiplex method found a similar proportion of non-detectable IL-1\u03b2 values (35) . Apart from IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, and IL-1\u03b2, we found that almost all of the other cytokines assayed in the multiplex (IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1) played a coherent role in the story, as hypothesized -either as a main effect (at the mean or person-centered level), or as an interaction effect with emotional acceptance in predicting sickness symptoms. Interestingly, the only cytokine not associated with variables of interest was IL-10, which is predominantly considered an antiinflammatory cytokine and is reported to exert tumor inhibiting action on breast cancer (61) . An important direction for future research will be to take a systems perspective and unpack the associations among multiple cytokines, assessed using multiplex immunoassays, to better understand whether certain cytokines are unique contributors to sickness symptoms in different contexts, or whether other emotion regulatory strategies moderate different cytokines.\n\nLimitations of the current study include the lack of an emotion measure to sufficiently determine if emotional acceptance was effective in decreasing negative affect, as well as focus on a single emotion regulation strategy, emotional acceptance. Other emotion regulation strategies that have been found to be effective in decreasing psychological distress in breast cancer patients include emotional expression (62) and positive reappraisal (26 , 27 , 63) . As such, these strategies may also positively influence the inflammation-sickness cycle, whereas less effective emotion regulation strategies (e.g., suppression, repression, avoidance, cognitive perseveration) may exacerbate it (64 -69) . However, we did not have measures of other emotion regulation strategies and identify this as a future research direction.\n\nSample and study characteristics are also worth mentioning: participants were somewhat ethnically diverse but racially homogenous, which may be due to the study having employed only a single site for assessment. Given the nature of secondary data analysis, other potentially relevant covariates (e.g., socioeconomic status) were not available for inclusion in analyses in the current sample. Additionally, the current study focused on sickness symptoms that were most closely aligned with physical functioning and not representative of other symptoms associated with sickness, such as loss of interest in activities, fever, and sleep changes. Fully capturing \"sickness behavior\", given its polymorphous meaning, is a challenge. Nevertheless, effective emotion regulation would likely influence not only functional, but also other symptoms associated with sickness behavior, and future research that takes an integrative approach to measure sickness behavior and its association with emotion regulation is needed.\n\nThese findings of increased sickness symptoms in women who received chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment, as compared to those who did not, or on assessment occasions associated with chemotherapy administration, are consistent with reports of increased inflammation associated with Adriamycin and taxanes (70) . In depth assessment of inflammatory markers potential mediation of this association is beyond the scope of this investigation but marks an important question that we will examine in future analyses.\n\nLastly, the observational nature of the study prevents us from establishing causality between higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines, low EA, and more sickness symptoms. Nevertheless, they suggest increases in EA may be beneficial for women with breast cancer, by interrupting the link between inflammatory cytokines and sickness behaviors. Analyses demonstrated relevant demographic characteristics and treatment variables do not account for the associations.\n\nThe present study extends previous work and demonstrates that proinflammatory cytokines are associated with more sickness symptoms in women with breast cancer. Importantly, however, when controlling for relevant demographic variables, emotional acceptance moderates the associations between cytokines and sickness symptoms such that, for a given woman, higher than average emotional acceptance attenuates the linkage of proinflammatory biomarkers (IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1) with sickness symptoms. These data suggest novel directions for emotion regulation and breast cancer research and, if replicated, would support the exploration of emotional acceptance interventions for treating sickness symptoms among women with breast cancer.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.\n\nInflammation was associated with more sickness symptoms in breast cancer patients.\n\n\u2022 On average, low emotional acceptance predicted high sickness symptoms across inflammatory levels.\n\n\u2022 Within-person, higher emotional acceptance attenuated effects of inflammation on sickness.
