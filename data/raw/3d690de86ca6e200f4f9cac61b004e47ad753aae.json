Finally, ExoN(-) virus replicated in the presence of an IFN-\u03b2-116 mediated antiviral state had both a decreased specific infectivity and decreased relative fitness 117 compared to untreated ExoN(-) virus. Thus, nsp14 ExoN appears to block or correct the 118 restriction of MHV infection by an IFN-mediated mechanism that may involve damaging 119 nascent viral RNA and affecting subsequent infectivity. 120 121 All rights reserved.

Binding of type I 123 interferon to the IFNAR receptor on the cell surface leads to a Jak/STAT signaling cascade that 124 ultimately results in the up-regulation and expression of hundreds of antiviral ISGs (4). In 125 addition, WT-MHV replication has been shown to be relatively resistant to the effects of IFN (1, 126 3, 22) . To determine whether the ExoN activity of MHV nsp14 was required for resistance to 127 IFN, we pretreated murine delayed brain tumor (DBT) cells with increasing concentrations of 128 mouse IFN-\u03b2 for 18 h prior to infecting with WT-MHV or ExoN(-) virus at a multiplicity of 129 infection (MOI) of 1 plaque-forming unit (PFU) per cell (Fig. 1A) . In response to pretreatment, WT-MHV viral titer decreased by approximately 1 log 10 as previously reported (1). 131\n\nIn contrast, ExoN(-) viral titer demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease and resulted in an 132 approximately 3 log 10 decrease in viral titer relative to untreated ExoN(-) viral titers. The ExoN 133 activity of nsp14 is conferred by active site residues present in 3 different motifs within the 134 ExoN domain (23). Therefore, to determine whether the observed sensitivity to IFN-\u03b2 135 pretreatment for ExoN(-) virus in Fig. 1A was due specifically to the absence of ExoN activity in 136 nsp14, we engineered and recovered a virus encoding only an aspartic acid to alanine 137 substitution in Motif III [ExoN3 (-) ]. Previously, we have demonstrated that viruses lacking 138\n\nExoN activity have decreased replication fidelity and are sensitive to the RNA mutagen 5-139 fluorouracil (5-FU) (16). Hence, 5-FU sensitivity is an in vitro indicator of ExoN activity. 140\n\nTherefore, first, we tested whether ExoN3 (-) and ExoN(-) demonstrated similar sensitivity to 5-141 FU to ensure that the ExoN activity of ExoN3(-) virus had been ablated. Similar to ExoN(-) , 142\n\nExoN3(-) viral replication in cells treated with increasing concentrations of 5-FU demonstrated a 143 dose-dependent decrease in viral titer relative to vehicle treated cells (Fig. 1B) . Further, ExoN(-) 144 All rights reserved.

Thus, these data suggest nsp14 ExoN 146 activity is required for resistance to the effects of regulation and expression of ISGs. 148 149 Increased replication capacity does not confer resistance to the effects of IFN-\u03b2 150 pretreatment for viruses lacking ExoN activity. ExoN(-) virus demonstrates an approximately 151 2 h delay in exponential replication and a 1 log 10 decrease in peak titer relative to . Therefore, we tested whether the IFN sensitivity phenotype observed for ExoN(-) and 153\n\nExoN3(-) viruses is due to the decreased replication capacity of these viruses. To do so, we 154 utilized an ExoN(-) virus developed by our lab that has been blindly passaged in DBT cells for 155 250 passages [ExoN(-) P250] (24). The replication capacity of the resulting ExoN(-) P250 virus 156 exceeds that of WT-MHV ( Fig. 2A) . However, despite increased replication capacity, ExoN(-) 157 P250 demonstrated similar sensitivity to IFN-\u03b2 pretreatment as ExoN(-) virus ( Fig. 2A and B) . 158\n\nHence, the IFN-\u03b2 sensitivity phenotype of viruses lacking ExoN activity is not dependent on 159 viral replication capacity but instead, is directly associated with a specific function of nsp14 160\n\nExoN that is required for efficient replication in the presence of an IFN-\u03b2-mediated antiviral 161 state. 162 163 Nsp14 ExoN activity is required for replication in wild-type B6 BMMs. We next wanted to 164 test whether ExoN activity was required for IFN resistance in primary innate immune cells, such 165 as BMMs. Replication of WT-MHV in primary BMMs is well described, and data suggest that 166 wild-type B6 BMMs (B6) express many PRRs and ISGs at a higher basal level than many mouse 167 cell lines (3, 25, 26) . In contrast, BMMs lacking the IFNAR receptor (IFNAR-/-) have lower 168 basal and expressed levels of ISGs; thus, making B6 and IFNAR-/-BMMs excellent cell types 169 for interrogating the role of ExoN activity on viral replication and antagonism of the innate 170 immune response (25). BMMs from B6 or IFNAR-/-mice were generated and infected with 171 WT-MHV or ExoN(-) virus at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell. Samples were harvested at the indicated 172 time points, and viral titers were determined by plaque assay (Fig. 3A) . \n\nby RNase L/PKR deficiency.

WT-MHV is well known to prevent or 191 delay the induction of IFN expression (3, 22) . However, ExoN activity may help prevent the 192 detection of a PAMP, namely dsRNA, which has been shown to be increased in an nsp15 EndoU 193 mutant (12) . Therefore, to determine whether the loss of ExoN activity resulted in the generation 194 and subsequent detection of a PAMP, we determined the level of IFN-\u03b2 gene expression in DBT The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/182196 doi: bioRxiv preprint 24 h post-infection. However, viral yield was minimal. These data suggest that loss of nsp14 214\n\nExoN activity does not lead to the transcriptional activation of IFN-\u03b2 or a notable dsRNA sensor 215 such as OAS/RNase L during infection of DBT cells. In addition, BMMs deficient in the 216 antiviral effectors RNase L and PKR were not sufficient to restore ExoN(-) viral replication. 217 218 IFN treatment does not substantially alter ExoN(-) viral RNA accumulation or particle 219 release. Since ExoN activity is required for resistance to IFN but had no effect on IFN induction, 220 we sought to discern the stage of viral replication that was restricted by IFN-\u03b2 treatment. To reductions in viral RNA could explain a small portion of the IFN phenotype, these data suggest 233 that decreased replication or transcription is not the primary driver of ExoN(-) IFN sensitivity. 234\n\nSince pretreatment of DBT cells with IFN-\u03b2 does not grossly alter ExoN(-) viral RNA 235 accumulation but does reduce ExoN(-) viral titers, we sought to determine whether IFN 236 All rights reserved.

In this study, we sought to determine the contributions of 306 nsp14 ExoN activity in the induction of and resistance to the innate immune response. We 307 demonstrate that ExoN(-) virus is sensitive to pretreatment with IFN-\u03b2. Because ExoN3(-) and 308\n\nExoN(-) P250 viruses were also sensitive to the effects of IFN, we conclude that IFN sensitivity 309 is specifically due to loss of ExoN activity. the experiments we performed. However, one would expect the endonucleolytic products of 326 nsp15 to be smaller dsRNAs that could still activate RIG-I or MDA5, similar to RNase L 327 products, unless another RNA degradation mechanism were in place (4, 31).

Lastly, when RNaseL -/-/ PKR -/-BMMs were infected with ExoN(-) virus, 330 viral replication was not rescued, suggesting that RNase L and PKR are not required for ExoN(-) 331 virus restriction (Fig. 4C) . Moreover, these data suggest dsRNA is not detected and the antiviral 332 (Fig.4A) . Interestingly, TGEV ExoN active site 337 mutants were non-viable; although, this is not the first report of non-viable ExoN active site 338 residue mutants in Alphacoronaviruses (21). In the initial report of CoV nsp14 ExoN activity, 339 human CoV 229E ExoN active site mutants were also non-viable, suggesting a common essential 340 function for nsp14 ExoN in Alphacoronavirus replication and/or innate antagonism (13). 341\n\nAltogether, the possibility of a common innate immune antagonism function for nsp14 across 342\n\nAlpha-and Beta-CoVs is apparent but clearly differing requirements exist that may be dependent 343 on the CoV genus and cell types used. 344\n\nOur results clearly demonstrate that viruses lacking ExoN activity are sensitive to IFN-\u03b2 345 pretreatment in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A,C and Fig. 2) . Further, replication of viruses 346 lacking ExoN activity was dependent on the capacity of BMMs to express genes downstream of 347 IFNAR signaling (Fig. 3) . This is due to the fact that B6 and IFNAR-/-cells have different levels 348 of basal ISG expression and thus, two very different intracellular environments for viral 349 replication to occur (3, 25, 26) . In IFNAR-/-BMMs, ExoN(-) and ExoN(-) P250 virus replication 350 capacity was restored to levels approaching or exceeding WT-MHV levels (Fig. 3) . Further, our 351 All rights reserved.

Altogether, our 353 results suggest that an ISG or ISGs is (are) acting on ExoN(-) virus, specifically resulting in 354 progeny that are less viable upon subsequent infection. Thus, it will be interesting to determine 355 the specific ISG or ISGs responsible for mediating the observed restriction.
