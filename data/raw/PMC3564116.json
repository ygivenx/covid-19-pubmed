{"title": "Insights into the Roles of Cyclophilin A During Influenza Virus Infection", "body": "Influenza virus is an enveloped negative-sense RNA virus that causes major public health problems worldwide. There are eight RNA segments in the in\ufb02uenza A virus encoding 14 viral proteins: the polymerase proteins (PB1, PB2, PA) [1,2], nucleocapsid protein (NP), hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), matrix proteins (M1 and M2), nonstructural proteins (NS1 and NS2) and the recently described PB1-F2, PB1 N40, PA-X and M42 proteins [1,2,3,4]. The M1 protein is the most abundant protein in the viral particle and forms the bridge between the viral envelope and core. M1 is a multifunctional protein in the influenza virus lifecycle that is involved in uncoating, transcription, the nuclear export of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNP), assembly and budding. Several host cell factors are putatively required for regulation of influenza virus replication via interaction with M1 at different stages of infection [5,6,7,8]. For instance, the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase Cyclophilin A (CypA) participates in influenza virus infection at several steps [9,10,11,12]. In addition, as a ubiquitously expressed host factor, CypA plays important roles in several viral infections [9,11,13,14,15,16,17,18,19]. The aim of this review is to promote our understanding of the effects of CypA during influenza virus infection.\n\nCypA is a ubiquitously distributed intracellular protein found in all tissues in mammals, and it possesses peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity [20]. CypA has chaperon-like activity and takes part in protein-folding processes [21]. Further, CypA is the major intracellular receptor for the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA), and the CsA-CypA complex interacts with and inhibits calcineurin, a calcium-calmodulin-activated serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase [22], which in turn suppresses T-cell activation. In addition to its intracellular functions, CypA can be secreted into the extracellular environment [23,24]. Extracellular CypA acts as a growth factor in several cell types. Furthermore, CypA is also involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including viral infection, cardiovascular disease and cancer. The extracellular functions of CypA are mediated by CD147, which is expressed on a wide variety of cells, including hematopoietic, epithelial and endothelial cells [25,26,27,28,29]. CD147 is a widely expressed type I integral membrane protein that is implicated in many physiological and pathological activities. Drugs targeting either CD147 or Cyps demonstrate a significant anti-inflammatory effect in animal models of acute or chronic lung diseases, suggesting a therapeutic pathway for some diseases.\n\nAccumulating evidence indicates that CypA is an important host factor for successful viral infection. CypA is involved in the lifecycle of several viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), influenza virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), vaccinia virus (VV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Rotavirus (RV) [10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,30,31]. CypA is also incorporated into several enveloped virus particles, such as HIV-1, influenza virus, VV and VSV [9,14,15,32,33]. However, the function of CypA in virus particles is still unclear.\n\nCypA has been extensively studied from the gene to protein level during HIV-1 infection. CypA is encoded by the peptidyl prolyl isomerase A (PPIA) gene, and regulatory PPIA polymorphisms are a component of genetic susceptibility to HIV-1 infection or disease progression [34]. In addition, the interaction of CypA and capsid protein (CA) in newly infected human target cells usually aids viral infectivity [16,35]. Furthermore, the interaction of newly synthesized HIV-1 CA with CypA is required for HIV-1 to induce dendritic cell (DC) maturation [36]. CypA may interact with other HIV-1 proteins, such as Vpr and p6, to regulate HIV infection [37,38,39,40,41]. Finally, CD147 is the main receptor for CypA on human leukocytes [42], and the interaction of CD147 and CypA may regulate an early step of HIV-1 infection [43]. The interaction of CD147 with CypA induces MA phosphorylation to regulate the liberation of the RT complex into the cytoplasm [44]. CypA mediates HIV-1 attachment to target cells via heparans, and heparans in turn facilitate the interaction of CD147 and CypA [45]. Furthermore, the interaction of CD147 and CypA regulates HIV-1 infection in a signal-independent fashion [46].\n\nSeveral lines of evidence indicate that CypA positively regulates the replication of HCV [47]. The PPIase activity of CypA assists the replication of HCV [48] and CypA increases the affinity of the polymerase to viral RNA via binding to NS5B, enhancing HCV replication [49]. In addition, CypA binds the HCV NS5A protein to aid viral replication [50]. Concerning HBV, CypA interacts with small surface proteins (SHBs) of the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg). In HBsAg-expressing cell lines, the expression level of CypA is lower than controls, and more CypA is secreted into the supernatant via the vesicular secretion pathway [19,51]. During VV infection, CypA stability is increased and CypA is translocated to the peripheral region of the nucleus, co-localizing with the sites of virus production. CypA is incorporated into the virus particle during morphogenesis and specifically localizes in the core [15]. In addition, CypA interacts with the nucleocapsid protein of VSV-NJ and VSV-IND in infected cells and is incorporated into the released virions of both serotypes. VSV-NJ utilizes CypA for post-entry intracellular primary transcription [14]. CypA is also reported to regulate SARS-CoV replication by binding to the nucleocapsid protein [52]. Recently, CypA was found to inhibit RV replication by facilitating host IFN-\u03b2 production, which is independent of CypA PPIase activity, but dependent on the activation of the JNK signaling pathway [30].\n\nUpon influenza virus infection, CypA acts at multiple steps of the viral lifecycle, including uncoating, viral protein entry into the nucleus, viral protein stability and assembly (Figure 1). In some stages, CypA negatively regulates influenza virus replication, but in other stages, CypA positively regulates the viral infection. Indeed, CypA is a cell-intrinsic regulator for influenza virus at different steps of its lifecycle.\n\nViral infection usually triggers host antiviral defenses, such as the interferon-I (IFN-I)-mediated antiviral response. Recently, CypA was found to play important roles in host antiviral innate immunity. For example, during HIV-1 infection, the interaction of CypA and newly synthesized HIV-1 CA assists HIV-1 to induce DC maturation, an antiviral type I interferon response, and the activation of T-cells. In addition, CypA inhibits Rotavirus replication by facilitating host IFN-\u03b2 production. Whether CypA mediates host antiviral defenses during influenza virus infection is an interesting question and requires further study. In addition, CypA is secreted into the extracellular space, and the function of extracellular CypA during influenza virus replication deserves further study."}
