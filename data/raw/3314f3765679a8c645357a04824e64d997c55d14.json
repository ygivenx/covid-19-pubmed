{"title": "Molecular analysis of Brazilian strains of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) reveals a deletion within the hypervariable region of the S1 subunit of the spike glycoprotein also found in human coronavirus OC43", "body": "Coronaviruses are classified in the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, which comprises the genera Coronavirus and Torovirus. In this same order, one can also find the families Arteriviridae and Roniviridae [18, 54] . The genus Coronavirus is subdivided into three groups (I, II, and III) according to epitopes of envelope glycoproteins, nucleotide sequences, and natural hosts [24] .\n\nBovine coronavirus (BCoV) belongs to group II, with a diameter up to 220 nm. The BCoV genome is a non-segmented positive-sense single-stranded RNA of 32 kb that forms a helicoidal nucleocapsid in association with the nucleoprotein (N), a phosphoprotein of 50-60 kDa, rich in basic amino acids. The viral envelope consists of a lipid bilayer with four structural proteins (HE, S, E, and M) that make the crown-like appearance of the virions [24, 30] .\n\nIn cattle, the most common BCoV-caused disease is neonatal calf diarrhea, which affects 3-to-4-week-old calves [44] . BCoV is also recognized as a causative agent of upper respiratory tract illness and bronchopneumonia in bovines [22, 23, 32, 51, 53] . Adult cows suffer from an enteric disease called winter dysentery, first described in the USA, also caused by BCoV strains found in calves [4, 8, 17] .\n\nThe major envelope protein of BoCV is the spike (S) protein, formerly named E2, organized as trimers that appear as 20-nm-long projections in the viral envelope and harbor domains responsible for receptor binding, haemagglutination, and induction of neutralizing antibodies, and therefore is the most polymorphic among coronavirus species and also among strains of the same species [13] . The BCoV S is proreolytically cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits of 90 kDa each [11] .\n\nThe carboxy-terminal S2 subunit contains the endodomain of S and forms the stalk of the spike, responsible for membrane fusion and syncytia formation [16, 25, 50, 52, 59] . The S1 subunit constitutes the amino-terminal ectodomain of S, which is much more variable than S2 and harbors the receptor-binding activity and forms the globular portion of the spike [30] .\n\nDue to its role in the formation of the globular portion of S and the fact that it harbors most of the antigenic sites of this protein, the S1 subunit is the most exposed to immunological selective pressures and thus most prone to polymorphism [1] .\n\nSince the spike glycoprotein is more sensitive to amino acid exchanges when compared to other coronavirus proteins, and the S gene has undergone more mutations in the past and has a greater potential for future mutations, studies focused on the S protein and S gene are appropriate for detecting intra-specific differences in the genus Coronavirus [14, 57] .\n\nBased on antigenic mapping with monoclonal antibodies, it is known, for instance, that an amino acid exchange in the antigenic domain II of the S protein may result in neutralization escape mutants [61] .Analysis of the S gene sequence is also useful for the discrimination among enteric coronaviruses detected in different individuals and for studies on the biological properties of the spike protein, e.g., infectivity for cell cultures [29, 38, 56, 60] .\n\nThis study aimed to propose a genealogy for enteric strains of BCoV based on the hypervariable region of the gene coding for the S1 subunit of the S protein of Brazilian strains of BCoV and strains detected in other countries.\n\nStool samples were collected between April 2000 and June 2002 from 51 calves from 10 dairy farms from 9 cities of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais States, Southeastern Brazil (Table 1) , from both diarrheic and non-diarrheic calves between 1 day and 6 months of age. Stool samples were prepared as 20% suspensions in PBS (PBS 0.01 M/BSA 0.1% pH 7.2) and clarified at 12,000 \u00d7 g/30 at 4 \u2022 C, and the supernatant was stored at \u221280 \u2022 C until analysis.\n\nBovine coronavirus Kakegawa strain [2] , grown in the HmLu-1 (hamster lung) cell line, both provided by Dr. Takeo Sakai (Nihon University, Japan), was used as positive control in the RT-PCRs.\n\nWith Primer Premier 5.0 ( c 2003 Premier Biosoft International), two pairs of primers were designed, corresponding to conserved regions flanking the hypervariable region of the S1 gene, as described by Hasoksuz et al. [20] , using BCoV S gene sequences (GenBank accession numbers AF058942.1, U06090.1, AF239306.1, M80844, U00735.2, M64667.1 and M64668.1) aligned by the CLUSTAL/W method with Bioedit v. 5.0.9 [19] . Outer primers: sense S1HS 5 -CTATACCCAATGGTAGGA-3 and anti-sense S1HA 5 -CTGAAACACGACCGCTAT-3 , with a predicted product of 885 bp (nt 1204 to 2088 of the S gene). Inner primers: sense S1NS 5 -GTTTCTGTTAGCAGGTTTAA-3 and anti-sense S1NA 5 -ATATTACACCTATC CCCTTG-3 , with a predicted fragment of 488 bp (nt 1329 to 1816 of S gene). Each primer was submitted to BLAST/n, and no non-BCoVS gene-related sequences were retrieved.\n\nReverse transcription (cDNA synthesis) was carried out at 42 \u2022 C for 60 min in a reaction mix with 1 \u00d7 First Strand Buffer (Invitrogen TM ), 1 mM of each dNTP, 10 mM DTT, 1 \u00b5M of each primer (S1HS and S1HA), 7 \u00b5L of RNA extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen TM ) (according to the manufacturer's instructions and denatured at 95 \u2022 C for 5 min) and 200 U of M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen TM ) in a 20-\u00b5L final reaction volume.\n\nNext, 5 \u00b5L of cDNA was added to the PCR mix with 1 \u00d7 PCR Buffer (Invitrogen TM ), 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.5 \u00b5M of each primer (S1HS and S1HA), 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 25.25 \u00b5L of ultra-pure water, and 1.25 U Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen TM ) in a 50 \u00b5L final reaction volume and submitted to 35 cycles of 94 \u2022 C for 1 min, 53.4 \u2022 C for 1.5 min and 72 \u2022 C for 1 min, followed by 72 \u2022 C for 10 min for final extension.\n\nThe nested step was carried out with 5 \u00b5L of the first-round amplification added to a mix with 1 \u00d7 PCR Buffer (Invitrogen TM ), 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.5 \u00b5M of each primer S1NS and S1NAS, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 25.25 \u00b5L of ultra-pure water and 1.25 U Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen TM ) in a 50 \u00b5L final reaction volume and submitted to 25 cycles of 94 \u2022 C for 1 min, 58.4 \u2022 C for 1.5 min, and 72 \u2022 C for 1 min, followed by 72 \u2022 C for 10 min.\n\nIn each reaction, the Kakegawa strain was used as the positive control and PBS as negative control. In the nested PCR, a tube containing ultra-pure water instead of template was included between every three tubes to monitor amplicon contamination. Furthermore, in order to avoid any laboratory contamination, each step (RNA extraction, reverse transcription and PCR, nested PCR, and electrophoresis) was carried out in a separate room with separate materials.\n\nThe products of the nested PCR were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel stained with 0.5 \u00b5g/mL ethidium bromide.\n\nThe 488-bp fragments obtained with RT-PCR S1 were purified from agarose gels using the Concert kit (Invitrogen TM ), quantified using the Low Mass DNA Ladder (Invitrogen TM ), and sequenced with BigDye 3.1 (Applied Byosystems TM ) according to manufacturer's instructions, without previous cloning in order to observe any signs of a quasispecies phenomenon in the chromatograms. The sequences were resolved in ABI-310 and ABI-377 automatic DNA sequencers (Applied Biosystems TM ).\n\nA genealogic tree was generated with the consensus sequences of each strain and 10 nonredundant homologous sequences retrieved from GenBank that were related to BCoV detected in calves from France, Canada, and the USA (Table 1) , and bredavirus strain B145 as an outgroup (GenBank accession no. AJ575373.1). All sequences in their respective reading frames were aligned by the CLUSTAL/W method with Bioedit v. 5.0.9 [19] and used to generate the consensus rooted maximum parsimony tree with the tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch-swapping heuristic algorithm with 1000 bootstrap replicates using PAUP 4.0 b10 ( c 2000 Smithsonian Institution), with the gaps considered as a fifth nucleotide.\n\nNucleotide identities and amino acid similarities of the translated sequences aligned with the BLOSUM62 matrix were calculated with Bioedit v. 5.0.9 [19] .\n\nThe secondary structure of the putative S1 hypervariable region was predicted with NNPredict at http://www.cmpharm.ucsf.edu/nomi/nnpredict.html.\n\nSeventeen out of the 51 stool samples were positive in the BCoV-specific RT-PCR targeting the S1 gene, and no spurious bands were found. PBS and nested internal controls demonstrated the specificity of the reactions and the absence of laboratory contamination.\n\nFifteen fragments out of the 17 samples produced by RT-PCR S1 resulted in BCoV-related sequences ( Table 1 ). The two remaining fragments could not be sequenced due to low DNA concentrations. Alignment of each of these sequences with that described by Hasoksuz et al. [20] (accession number U00735.2) and BLAST/n analysis confirmed that they corresponded to the hypervariable region of the S1-encoding gene. Mean nucleotide identities to a stretch of 330 nucleotides with alignment to nucleotides 1381 to 1710 of the S gene of the Mebus strain (accession number U00735.2) are shown in Table 2 .\n\nThe nucleotide alignment (Fig. 1 ) revealed a gap of 18 nucleotides (ATGC TGC(C/T) CAATGT(A/G)(A/G)TT), which corresponds to nucleotides 1577 to 1594 of the S gene. This gap begins at the second nucleotide of codon 526 (AAT) and finishes at the first nucleotide of codon 531 (TGT) of the S gene and was found in 14 out of the 15 sequenced field strains. Strain USP01, the only Brazilian one Table 2 . Mean, maximum, and minimum nucleotide identities to the alignment region of a 330-bp-long segment of the hypervariable region of the S1 subunit-coding region of 15 field strains of BCoV included in the present study, and 10 BCoV S gene sequences from Fig. 1 . Section of the alignment of 330 nt of the hypervariable region of the S1 subunit-coding region of the S gene of BCoV, corresponding to nucleotides 1381 to 1710 of the Mebus strain S gene (U00735.2). Strains USP01, -2, -3, -7, and -9 refer to BCoV field strains from the present study. Sequences for USP04, -05, -06, -08, -10 to -14, and strain LYVB were identical to USP03 and are therefore not included in this figure   Fig. 2 . Section of the alignment of the deduced 110 amino acids of the analysed hypervariable region of the S1 subunit of BCoV S protein corresponding to residues 461 to 570 of the Mebus strain S protein. Strains USP01, -2, -3, -7, and -9 refer to BCoV field strains from the present study. Sequences for USP04, -05, -06, -08, -10 to -14, and strain LYVB were identical to USP03 and are therefore not included in this figure that lacks this gap, showed a nucleotide identity of 100% within the gap region with the sequences retrieved from the GenBank. The alignment of the deduced amino acids, corresponding to residues 461 to 570 of the Mebus strain (accession number U00735.2), showed that this nucleotide deletion results in the loss of 6 amino acids (NAAQC(D/G/N) (Fig. 2) , corresponding to residues 526 to 531 of the S protein. In additon, a C \u2192 S substitution was present in the amino acid position right after this gap in all of the 14 field strains with the deletion.\n\nThe mean amino acid homology among the 15 Brazilian field strains was 98%, ranging from 88% to 100%. Among the sequences from the USA, the mean amino acid homology was 97%, varying from 96 to 98%, while among the Canadian strains the mean amino acid homology was 96.67% and varied from 96% to 98%. Twenty-one out of the 37 nucleotide substitutions are exclusive to some strains, while the other 16 are at sites that vary in more than one strain.\n\nThe tree in Fig. 3 shows that all strains in which the 18-nucleotide gap was found grouped in an exclusive polytomic cluster, while the other strains clustered in a separate group with a resolved genealogy, giving rise to two major clusters among the studied strains. The two clusters of BCoV appear as paraphyletic groups, the gap evidenced as an unique evolutive event in the genealogy.\n\nAnalysis of the secondary structure prediction of the deduced amino acid sequences from the studied region of S1 of all Brazilian field strains and from strains Mebus, Norden, and BCQ-1523, chosen because they represent the polymorphism found in the last amino acid residue in the region that corresponds to the amino acid gap (Fig. 2) , suggests that the gap occurs inside a loop region without helices or strands.\n\nA gap of 18 nucleotides, not reported for BoCV so far, was found between positions 1577 to 1594 of the gene coding for the spike protein of enteric strains of BCoV, resulting in the absence of amino acids 526 to 531 and the substitution of a cysteine in the position immediately after the gap by a serine (Fig. 2) within the ectodomain of the S protein. This gap was present in Brazilian field strains USP02 to USP14 and LYVB but not in strain USP01, whose sequence in this region is up to 100% identical to the sequences retrieved from the GenBank. So far, the gap appears to be present only in field strains circulating in Brazil. This conclusion is supported by a recent study on the molecular diversity of Korean BCoV field strains based on the hypervariable region of the S1 subunit. Jeong et al. [26] described that all analysed strains cluster together with strains OK0514 and LY138, while a different cluster containing the Mebus and BCVF15 strains emerged. None of the Korean field strain lacked the sequence absent in Brazilian field strains USP02 to USP14 and LYVB.\n\nObserving these results under a parsimony evolutive model, we suggest that this gap is a deletion rather than an insertion, since fewer steps would be needed to create a deletion than to create a 18-nucleotide insertion in the other strains. Independent evolutionary events that lead to the same result are less probable, decreasing the number of extra-evolutionary steps, i.e., the number of homoplasies, which could lead to similarities in character status by, for instance, convergence, and not homology among the studied taxa, assuming that all BCoV strains share a common origin [35, 49] .\n\nIn the tree shown in Fig. 3 , the Brazilian isolates have a tendency to segregate into the \"deleted\" cluster 2, while the Brazilian field strain USP01 and the other, mainly cell-culture-adapted strains, segregate into the \"non-deleted\" cluster 1.\n\nInterestingly, the same 18-nt deletion described for the Brazilian BCoV strains in this study was found in human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), a group II coronavirus that plays a role in human colds. This deletion does not exist in other human strains, and deletions in the gene coding for the S1 subunit have never been reported in studies focused on genetic and antigenic properties and comparison between human and bovine coronaviruses [36, 45] .\n\nThus, one can speculate that strains from both BCoV and HCoV-OC43 will segregate in a similar clustering pattern if this deletion is taken into account. This close evolutionary relationship between these two virus species is in agreement with the recently proposed zoonotic spillover of BCoV based on the high degree of identity between this virus and HCoV-OC43 [55] .\n\nAlthough the rooted tree in Fig. 3 does not allow the common ancestor to the BCoV strains studied herein to be identified, this role can be assigned to a non-deleted BCoV strain (cluster 1, Fig. 3 ) on the onset of the spillover event that might have originated both the human coronavirus strains with or without this deletion and the deleted BCoV strains.\n\nThe biological implications of amino acid deletions in the spike protein of coronaviruses might include a lower fusogenic activity [28] , loss of the cleavage site between subunits S1 and S2 [59] , and changes in tissue tropism [31] . The 6-amino-acid deletion described here occurs inside a hypervariable region of the S1 subunit and is part of its domain II, responsible for the conformational epitopes A and B of this subunit and thus may result in the loss of immunological crossreaction between the two clusters [61] .\n\nAlthough the amino acid deletion has not led to major alterations in the predicted secondary structures of the proteins, it is possible that the deleted loop may have caused a loss of conformational epitopes or the appearance of new ones by changes in the overall structure of the protein or by bringing existing epitopes together.\n\nFurthermore, as the S1 ectodomain has a major role in receptor binding, mutations in this region may be an indication of a different virus-host interaction. For instance, for human coronavirus HCoV-229E, the domain comprised by amino acids 417 to 547 of the S protein -the same region where the deletion described here was found -has been shown to be essential for binding to the specific receptor, human amino peptidase [7] . The extent of deletions in the hypervariable region of the S1 subunit may also give raise to phenotypes with differences regarding receptor-binding activity, cleavage of the S protein, conformational changes in the S protein, tissue tropism, and disease patterns [62] .\n\nThe ability to escape the host's immune system may also be a result of deletions in the epitopes of the S1 ectodomain, allowing the mutants to circumvent the action of cytotoxic T lymphocytes [5, 10, 40] . The occurrence of viral genomes with deletions in the S gene as, for instance, between nucleotides 1200 to 1800 of some isolates of MHV, which corresponds to the same region where the 18-nucleotide deletion has been detected in the present study, contributes to the quasispecies form of coronavirus populations [43] .\n\nThe divergence among the strains sequenced in the present study and those from North America ( Table 2 ) could be due to the geographic distance between the surveyed areas, different cattle breeds, or even the breeding system, which could exert selective pressure on the S1 hypervariable region during the time, which varied up to 38 years, as in the case of the sequence corresponding to strain LY138 ( Table 1) .\n\nThe mean nucleotide identities among strains from the USA and Canada (Table 2) , geographically close countries, are similar, possibly due to the circulation of low-divergent BCoV strains. It is noteworthy that the expected high nucleotide identity to other regions of the BCoV S gene, such as S1B, with a mean of 97% [41] or the whole S gene, with 98% [58] to strains from Canada and the USA are close to those found here among sequences from these countries included in the analysis. Except for strain USP1, the results obtained in the present study uphold this phylogeographical pattern of BCoV strains, since cluster 2 (Fig. 3) contains strains from two geographically contiguous Brazilian States (Table 1) .\n\nDivergences within the S1 genes of members of the same species of coronavirus are not uncommon. For instance, among different samples of MHV (Murine HepatitisVirus) coronavirus, the amino terminus of S1 has an amino acid similarity ranging from 75 to 85% [48] . Furthermore, between some MHV and BCoV samples, the S1 genes have up to 81% nucleotide identity [6] .\n\nNevertheless, strains from the USA and Canada, as well as strain BCV-F15 from France, were adapted to cell cultures, mainly in HRT-18 cells (Table 1) , while strains sequenced in the present study have been obtained directly from fecal samples. This adaptation to cell culture may favor, by selection under similar conditions, a given S protein to prevail among other variants, biasing the study of the original sequences present in the original host [21] . This has already been reported for samples of canine coronavirus (CCoV) from fecal samples and CCoV reference strains grown in cell cultures, where the maximum nucleotide identity found for the S gene was 86.1% [38] .\n\nThis hypothesis is in agreement with the episodic evolution model proposed for coronaviruses [3] , according to which the molecular clock is accelerated during periods of environmental changes, such as adaptation to cell cultures, that are deleterious to the progenitor viruses, causing the viral population to evolve in short jumps in a short time interval towards a population that is divergent from the initial one. Populations of coronaviruses, an RNA virus with short replication times [47] , large progeny size, a mutation rate close to 10 \u22124 , and an RNA recombination rate of 20%, are prone to a high genetic variability when the target of the selection is not a single genotype but rather a heterogeneous population of mutants generated by erroneous replication of the most frequent mutant. This population of mutants is the basis of the quasispecies definition, the form that one expects to find in a population of coronavirus from a clinical sample [3, 37, 42] .\n\nStrain USP01, grouped in cluster 1, and strains USP02, USP03, USP04, USP05, USP11, USP12, USP13, USP14, and LYVB from cluster 2 were found in samples from calves without clinical information; strains USP07, USP08, USP06, USP09, and USP10 from cluster 2 were obtained from calves without diarrhea at the time of collection. Because of this lack of information, one can only hypothesize about pathogenicity or virulence variations among these 15 strains. Taking into account the position of the sequences retrieved from the GenBank in the genealogic tree (Fig. 3 ) -all of them isolates from animals with clinical diarrhea -both clusters might cause enteritis and diarrhea.\n\nOf the 37 sites in the nucleotide alignment region where substitutions have been observed, 21 were exclusive to a given sequence, and the sequences from strains USP02, USP09, USP07, BCQ20, Mebus, and BCQ571 showed more nonsynonymous than synonymous mutations. The other 16 sites in which nucleotide substitutions were found, 11 of which resulted in amino acid substitutions, are shared by two or more strains and are not single mutations, which might mean that these are consensus positions in the respective strains and not apomorphic conditions.\n\nThus, in the sequences in which the number of non-synonymous mutations exceeded that of synonymous mutations, taking into account only the point mutations exclusive to some of the strains and not those shared by two or more strains at variable sites, there is an indication of selective advantage at the time these mutations appeared in these sequences. This might suggest that under positive selection the rate of fixation of non-synonymous mutations is higher than the rate of fixation of translationally silent nucleotide substitutions [9, 39] .\n\nIt is expected that changes in the gene coding for the S protein, and mainly in the hypervariable region studied here, may be invaluable genetic markers for a more comprehensive understanding of BCoV-caused diseases and for the development of studies on diagnostics and molecular characterization, as well as for the prediction of the efficiency of immunogens. Comparing pathogenicity and virulence between these two clusters of BCoV, based, for instance, on fusogenic activity in cell cultures, is still a field of research, as well as investigations regarding other regions of the BCoV genome, such as the region encoding the S2 subunit, which plays a major role in membrane fusion.\n\nIn summary, a genealogy is proposed for enteric strains of bovine coronavirus based on the nucleotide sequences of the region coding for the hypervariable region of the S1 subunit of the spike protein, according to which two clusters (1 and 2) emerged with an 18-nt deletion shared with HCoV-OC43."}
