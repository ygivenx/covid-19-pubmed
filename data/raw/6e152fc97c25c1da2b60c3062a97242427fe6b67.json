{"title": "Ocular conjunctival inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 can cause mild COVID-19 in Rhesus macaques 2 3", "body": "inoculated with 1\u00d710 6 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 via conjunctival (CJ), intratracheal 23 (IT), and intragastric (IG) routes, respectively. Remarkably, the CJ 24 inoculated-macaques developed mild interstitial pneumonia and viral load was 25 detectable in the conjunctival swabs at 1 days post-inoculation (dpi). Only via IT 26 inoculation, viral load was detected in the anal swab at 1-7 dpi and macaque showed 27 weight loss. However, viral load was undetectable after IG inoculation. Comparatively, 28 viral load was higher in the nasolacrimal system but lesions of lung were relatively 29 mild and local via CJ inoculation compared with that via IT inoculation, 30 demonstrating distinct characteristics of virus dispersion.

A previous study reported the case of a 41 clinician who was infected with SARS-CoV-2 while working with patients under all 42 safeguards except eye protection 3 . By contrast, no SARS-CoV-2 could be detected by 43 RT-PCR in 114 conjunctival swabs samples from patients with COVID-19 pneumonia . The potential extra-respiratory portals that SARS-CoV-2 enter the host need to be 45 further research by laboratory-confirmation for providing significant data to oversight 46 and prevention for healthcare workers. We daily observed the macaques for clinical signs. There was no significant change in 56 the body weight ( Figure 2A ) in the CJ and IG inoculated macaques and the 57 temperature ( Figure 2B ) in all the inoculated macaques, while the weight loss was 58 obvious in the IT inoculated macaques and dropped about 125 g at 5 dpi. Routine 59 specimens, including nasal and throat swabs, were collected on 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7-day 60 post-inoculation (dpi). Additionally, to explore the potentially excretory routes of 61 SARS-CoV-2 in the host, the conjunctival and anal swabs were also gathered. 62 author/funder. All rights reserved.

In contrast, the virus was not detected 64 in any swabs from the IG inoculated macaques. Notably, only via the CJ route, viral 65 load can be tested in conjunctival swabs (average, approximately 4.33 log10 RNA 66 copies/mL) on 1 dpi and then became undetectable implying that the 67 inoculated-SARS-CoV-2 may be transferred from the initial entry-conjunctiva to 68 respiratory tract and other tissues. Meanwhile, only via the IT route, viral load can be 69 ongoing examined in the anal swabs on 1-7 dpi and reached the peak about 6.76 log10 70 RNA copies/mL on 5 dpi, revealing distinct excretory pathways of host after 71 inoculation via different routes ( Figure 2C ). To determine the distribution of virus and histological lesions, CJ-1, IT-1, and IG-1 74 were euthanized and necropsied on 7 dpi. For CJ-1, viral load was primarily 75 distributed in the nasolacrimal system and ocular, including the lacrimal gland (3.93 76 log10 RNA copies/mL), optic nerve (1.03 log10 RNA copies/mL), and conjunctiva 77 (1.01 log10 RNA copies/mL); in the nose, including the nasal mucosa (6.25 log10 RNA 78 copies/mL), nasal turbinate (6.63 log10 RNA copies/mL), and nostril (1.03 log10 RNA 79 copies/mL); in the pharynx including epiglottis (4.57 log10 RNA copies/mL), soft 80 palate (5.60 log10 RNA copies/mL); in the oral cavity including check pouch (1.03 81 log10 RNA copies/mL) and parotid gland (1.04 log10 RNA copies/mL); as well as in 82 other tissues including lower left lobe of lung (4.6 log10 RNA copies/mL), tonsil (4.51 83 log10 RNA copies/mL), inguinal (1.01 log10 RNA copies/mL) and pararectal (6.25 84 author/funder.
