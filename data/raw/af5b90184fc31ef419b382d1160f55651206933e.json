It has had a widely publicised impact on the economy of afflicted areas. Medical services have suffered massive disruption. Even services far removed from respiratory medicine and critical care have suffered because of the diversion of resources needed to support the victims of the epidemic and through the illness of staff. As a resource-intensive speciality that deals predominantly with non-emergency cases, interventional electrophysiology is particularly vulnerable to disruption.\n\nWhile the pandemic disrupts the delivery of routine electrophysiology services, COVID-19 is associated with cardiac complications which could bring an additional burden of acute problems to electrophysiology. [3] [4] [5] The relative importance of the reduction in elective cases and any increase in emergency work is undefined.\n\nWenzhou, Milan and London are each cities with a metropolitan area population of more than 4 million people; each has each been struck by the pandemic. During the initial months of 2020, Wenzhou experienced the greatest concentration of COVID-19 cases of any Chinese city outside the Hubei province. 6 Following an intense program of public health interventions 7 , new cases declined and have now vanished.\n\nAs of March 27 th 2020, Wenzhou has had no new case of COVID-19 for the last 38 consecutive days. With this, many sectors have begun to return toward normality with stringent precautions. Milan was close to the centre of the Italian outbreak of COVA-19 and had to suspend all activity the first week in March. 8 London, like the rest of the United Kingdom has seen an abrupt rise in the disease incidence only since the second week of March 2020. 9 The disruption for cardiac electrophysiology labs has begun.\n\nWe reviewed the catheter lab records of electrophysiology laboratories in a centre that experienced a high burden of COVID-19 early and near the origin of the pandemic and one in which the onset was delayed.

We charted the burden of emergency procedures performed to look for evidence of any augmentation of these arising from COVID-19, and we interviewed the front-line cardiologists for information about arrhythmic complications encountered in the COVID-19 population. We looked for instances of COVID-19 infection acquired in hospital by electrophysiology patients and staff. We documented the protocols used to permit the resumption of activity after the first wave of the epidemic and examined the success of anti-infective precautions.\n\nThe first diagnosis of COVID-19 in Wenzhou Medical University was in mid-January \n\nIn each of the centres, routine activity of the EP lab was suspended within a week of the first locally diagnosed COVID-19 case in the hospital (table 1). The primary reason for the prompt suspension in each case was the concern that continuing to admit patients for elective procedures would expose patients to the risk of infection from undiagnosed COVID-19 patients already in the hospital.\n\nWe encountered no instance of an arrhythmia occurring as a definable consequence of COVID-19 that required ablation as an emergency procedure. A small number of patients required emergency ablation during the period of restricted activity (table 2, figure 2), but this represented less than 5% of the normal workload of the centres.\n\nThe distribution of cases was similar to that encountered in normal times with supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation all represented.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Three nurses in a cardiology ward in Milan were infected, but none of the electrophysiologists. In Wenzhou, no staff member was infected.\n\nOf the centres involved, only Wenzhou has been able to resume routine activity. This 1) Patients underwent a pre-assesment visit the day before hospital admission.\n\nAt this visit, a nasal swab was analysed by PCR for evidence of the virus.\n\n2) Patients with a satisfactory screening visit were admitted on the morning of the scheduled procedure and underwent a second nasal swab. If the PCR was negative for the virus, the procedure went ahead as planned.\n\nIn all centres, outpatient activity was moved to a telephone-based or internet-based format in all possible cases from the time that widespread local transmission of the virus was recognised. Only those who were clinically urgent and were unable to to use a telephone or required an instrumental test were allowed to keep their physical All rights reserved.

Outpatient investigations were cancelled unless clinically urgent.\n\nPatients who had access to mobile-phone associated ECG recording were encouraged to use these and transmit recordings in preparation for telephone consultations.\n\nAs part of social distancing, all EP educational meetings were suspended in all centres, and all major international meetings have been cancelled. Electronic learning has been put into practice across several medical disciplines and improving web-based educational tools. Major medical examinations such as the Membership exam (MRCP) and university entrance exams have been delayed indefinitely.\n\nThe EP team in Wenzhou and that in London defaulted to emergency mode at the arrival of the first COVID cases. With elective work being cancelled, the electrophysiologists concentrated on urgent inpatient intervention including pacemaker implantation to minimist the time that any patient had to spend in hospital. The centres differed in their policies on redistributing staff to other duties.\n\nWe have no gift to set a statesman right\" William Yates 10 The electrophysiologist, like the poet is a luxury that society may dispense with when times are exceptionally difficult. Our work reduces or resolves troublesome symptoms; in narrow subgroups of the population that we serve, we may increase life expectancy, albeit marginally.

There is enhanced expression of ACE-2 in those with cardiovascular conditions, possibly accounting for the apparent greater severity of COVID-19 related illness in these patients. In one study, a majority (58%) of those with severe infection had a background of hypetension, and non-specifically 44% had a history of 'arrhythmia'. 13 Binding of the virus to ACE2 receptors in the lung and the heart initiates the acute inflammatory response. Pneumonia results, but also evidence of myocarditis; those with a rise in high-sensitivity Troponin I are more likely to require admission to intensive care. 14 There is a strong association between a history of hypertension and mortality from COVID-19. Systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in those with COVID-19 treated in intensive care units compared to those not requiring this level of care (144 versus 122, P<0.001). 14 This may relate to up-regulation of ACE2 receptors in those receiving ACE inhibiting drugs.

Any acute inflammatory condition can destabilise coronary plaque and triger acute coronary syndromes. A minority of patients with COVID-19 may present acutely with cardiac sounding symptoms. 13 It is not clear whether the apparent high mortality in patients with ischaemic heart disease represents an effect on ACE2 receptor expression, a vulnerability to ischaemic complications of the systemic illness or a bias against such patients when ventilatiors must be rationed. The pathophysiology of COVID-19 and its routes of systemic transmission remain incompletely understood. Observations had been noted of its neuroinvasive potential via peripheral neuronal trans-synaptic route and viral preponderance in organs with low expression of ACE2. 15 Brugada syndrome is a concern as the prolonged febrile illness characteristic of COVID-19 has the propensity to trigger arrhythmias. No such case has been reported, but like patients with heart failure and ischaemic heart disease, those with Brugada syndrome should take particular care to isolate themselves from likely sources of infection.\n\nNo specific pharmacological therapy exists, but drugs being trialled in treating aspects of COVID-19 include anti-retrovirals and hydrochloroquine. These drugs may cause cardiotoxicitiy and prolong corrected QT intervals. No instance of a lifethreatening arrhythmia from this source has been reported.\n\nThe risk of COVID-19 transmission to healthcare workers is high, with over 8% reported in Italy. 16 Ophthalmologists have been disproportionately affected, probably because of the close contact with the patients in whom conjunctivitis has been a presenting symptom. 17 Intensivists are at risk due to their inevitable extensive contact with severely affected patients and due to aerosol generation during intubation. Cardiology, including ablation and trans-esophageal echo also involves aerosol generating procedures (AGP) and close proximity to the patient.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, a patient entering the cardiac catheter lab will encounter approximately 10 healthcare professionals before moving to a ward for recovery. The combination of numerous close contacts and fomites creates a risk of transmission. It makes sense to defer procedures whenever possible. Emergency All rights reserved.

In the London cohort, the average age is 65, and >60% are male. 18 Co-existing diabetes, hypertension or heart failure are common. All of these, particularly hypertension are strong risk factors for COVID-19 related mortality. It was therefore obligatory to halt the performance of routine ablation procedures until the risk recedes.\n\nNot all EP patients can wait on indefinitely. Guidelines published by NHS England, 19 include narrow criteria for ablation in this crisis, recommending that it is limited to cases of rapidly conducted pre-excited atrial fibrillation, heart failure secondary to tachycardia, and ventricular tachycardia that is controllable with medication. All of the ablations conducted in all 3 centres during the period of restricted activity met these criteria ( figure 2, table 2) .\n\nStrict guidelines were put in place in each centre to minimise the risk to patients and staff in cases where ablation had to be performed.

During the procedure, staff wore PPE.\n\nThe reduction in electrophysiology caseload related to the pandemic will effect the EP industry. Companies which supply equipment have shut offices and distribution networks. Loss of revenue will last for many months. Companies may prosper and may help the fight against the pandemic by switching production to items of relevance to that fight: Ventilators and associated equipment, viral test kits and thermometers.\n\nIn China, the official recognition of the seriousness of the outbreak and the take-over by central government of direct responsibility for its handling coincided with the introduction of an integrated set of measures. 7 Best publicised was the lock-down of society and industry to achieve extreme social distancing. The less-publicised adjunct to the lock-down was the introduction of a system for screening all persons with fever or with a history of contact with known cases, so that they could be has not yet been developed.\n\nThe experience from Wenzhou shows that with energetic public health intervention, the epidemic may be suppressed, and normal life may resume with precautions.
