{"title": "Article Whole-genome based Archaea phylogeny and taxonomy: A composition vector approach", "body": "The introduction of 16S rRNA analysis and the recognition of Archaea as one of the three main domains of life by Woese and coworkers [1] was a milestone in prokaryotic phylogeny and taxonomy. Although at present there is no generally accepted prokaryotic taxonomy, many microbiologists consider the new edition of the Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology [2] and the closely related Taxonomic Outline of Bacteria and Archaea (TOBA) [3] as the best approximation to a standard [4] . As both Bergey's Manual and TOBA are based on 16S rRNA phylogeny, complemented by single gene or few gene analysis and traditional morphological characters, many questions remain unanswered as regards the objectivity and reliability of this approach. In particular, to what extent conclusions drawn from aligning a single or a few RNA or protein-coding *These authors contributed equally to this work \u2020Corresponding author (email: hao@mail.itp.ac.cn) genes may be applied to the relation of species. It is natural that whole-genome based methods may yield more convincing results in this context. However, most whole-genome based phylogenetic methods rely on sequence alignments at certain stage and alignment algorithms often involve various parameters, e.g., scoring matrices and gap penalties. Therefore, their results require alternative and independent verification by parameter-free and alignment-free phylogenetic methods. Our newly proposed Composition Vector (CVTree) approach [5, 6] is such a method and has been successfully applied to viruses [7, 8] , chloroplasts [9] , prokaryotes [5, 10] and fungi [11] . Nonetheless, the intention of this study is not merely to add a few more leaves to a tree, but to keep some records for the future test of the predictive capability of the CVTree approach. The 7 species from the 56 available Archaea genomes without a definite or complete taxonomic characterization provides an appropriate opportunity.\n\n(i) Genomes. A total of 56 complete Archaea genomes was downloaded from the NCBI FTP site [12] . A list of full binomina with strain tags of these organisms together with their NCBI accession numbers is given in Table 1 . The \"TOBA Code\" given in the third column is explained below.\n\n(ii) Taxonomic references. The Bergey's Manual [2] and TOBA Rel.7.7 [3] are our main taxonomic references. As the taxa in TOBA were only listed by their names we have generated an explicit numbering for all taxonomic ranks from phyla down to genera. All the lineages represented by 49 out of the 56 genomes are given in Table 1 . A lineage such as \"Archaea Phylum 1 (Crenarchaota) which consists of only Class 1 (Thermoprotei) -Order 4 (Sulfolobales) which contains only Family 1 (Sulfolobaceae) -Genus 4 (Metallosphaera)\" is abbreviated as A1=1.4=1.4. We define this as a TOBA code. Note that this code varies with the TOBA Release and only serves as a shorthand to make computer work easy. Those interested in the taxon names represented by numbers should consult the full text of TOBA Rel.7.7 [3] .\n\nThe NCBI TaxBrowser, though disclaimed to be a taxonomic reference, is, in fact, more dynamic and up-to-date, but largely incomplete. For the 7 species that have not been included in TOBA Rel.7.7 we assign a tentative code by referring to the NCBI lineage. We list these organisms and their tentative code below and in column 4 of (a new Archaea phylum?). (iii) The 16S rRNA tree. Though the Bergey's Manual and TOBA already reflect results of 16S rRNA analysis to a certain extent, sometimes we need to check the position of a species in a 16S rRNA tree directly. In this case we refer to the All-Species Living Tree project [13] of which the latest (October 2008) release contains 7006 strains.\n\n(iv) The CVTree method. The CVTree method [5, 6] has been described before. We hereby give a brief account. An organism is represented by a Composition Vector (CV) derived from all protein products in its genome. For a fixed integer K one collects all overlapping K-peptides, starting from the beginning of a protein. Putting all 20 K possible K-peptide counts in lexicographic order of the amino acid characters as components, a raw CV of 20 K dimensions is obtained. Then each component is \"renormalized\" by subtracting a \"predicted\" count by using a Markovian assumption from the counts of (K\u22121) and (K\u22122) peptides. The subtraction procedure suppresses random background caused by neutral mutations and highlights the taxon-specificity of the CV [6] . Then correlations between CV pairs are calculated to generate a distance/dissimilarity matrix from which trees are constructed by using the neighbor-joining [14] program from the Philip package [15] . In order to enable experimental biologists to enjoy the CVTree method a Web Server [16, 17] has been made public. In fact, all the Archaea trees used in this study were generated by using the recent update [17] of the CVTree Web Server.\n\nA distinctive feature of the CVTree approach consists in the way of justifying the results. While traditional sequence alignment based phylogeny relies mostly on stability and self-consistency arguments (e.g., bootstrapping and jackknifing), the CVTree output is compared directly with taxonomy viewed as \"experimental fact\". The feasibility of this strategy is ensured by the far-reaching progress of taxonomy as well as by the high resolution power of CVTree [10] .\n\nFive genus trees for K=3 to 7 were generated from 861 (56 Archaea, 797 Bacteria, and 8 Eukarya as outgroups) built-in genomes in the CVTree Web Server as of 31 March, 2009. Then Archaea branches were cut from these trees for further study. The original 861-genome trees are given in the electronic supplementary material [18] . The new CVTree web server returns a subdirectory of Collapsed-trees in which an organism tree is collapsed to various taxonomic ranks from phylum down to species if the corresponding phylogenetic branches agree with taxonomy. This feature greatly facilitates the analysis of the resulted trees.\n\nThe peptide length K controls the resolution of the CVTree method. Due to the (K\u22122)-th order Markovian assumption used in the CVTree algorithm the K value starts from 3. For small K values the number of different K-peptides grows exponentially as 20 K and most if not all peptide types are present. For greater K this number is limited by a linearly decreasing function L-M(K+1). There is a prominent maximum in the distribution of significant K-peptide number. For prokaryotes both overall structure and fine branchings of CVTrees are \"best\" (in the sense of agreement with taxonomy) at K=5 or 6. In particular, the resolution of the three main domains of life, Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya, appears from K=4. \n\nTaxonomy has long become an established discipline with its own regulations and codes, worked out by committees and subcommittees. In making comparison with taxonomy we do not aim at introducing new taxonomic revisions. Our guiding principle is monophyleticity. Whenever leaves in a monophyletic branch come under a taxonomic unit we call the branch by that taxonomic name. We perform a reduction of CVTrees from bottom up in order to carry out a thorough comparison with taxonomy. First of all, there are 6 extremely halophilous archaeons that form a monophyletic branch in all CVTrees from K=3 to 7, as shown in Figure 1 . Among this group five species belong to different genera of one and the same class Halobacteria which contains only one order that in turn contains only one family, i.e., they share a common TOBA code A2.4=1=1. Independent of the internal placement, the genus Haloquadratum, not listed in TOBA but present in the all-living species tree [13] , was safely assigned to the same lineage. Hereafter we shall denote this branch as A2.4 (6) .\n\nAnother monophyletic branch containing 11 species is shown in Figure 2 . Among these 11 species, three are not listed either in TOBA or in the All-Living Species Tree [13] . By comparing with the TOBA genus list, we suppose that both Candidatus Methanoregula and Candidatus Methanosphaerula should belong to the order Methanomicrobiales. They may come from one or two new families within this order (Code A2.3.1.?). On the other hand, the uncultured methanogenic archaeon RC-I, discovered in rice field [19] , may belong to a new family in another order Methanosarcinales or even to a new order in the class Methanomicrobia (Code A2.3.2.? or A2.3.?).\n\nSimilar monophyletic branches at the rank class or lower include Thermoplasmata A2.5(3), Desulfurococcales A1= 1.3(5), Sulfolobales A1.4(4), Thermoproteaceae A1=1.1.1 (6) . Figures of these clusters are not shown as they do not contain unspecified lineages such as those marked by an asterisk in Figures 1 and 2 .\n\nWith these shorthand notations we are now in a position to consider the convergence at the next higher level. Among the 8 classes of the phylum Euryarchaeota (A2), seven do form a monophyletic cluster comprising 28 organisms as shown in Figure 3 . This monophyletic branch will be denoted as A2(28) in further reduced trees ( Figure 5 ).\n\nThe phylum Crenarchaeota (A1) contains a single class Figure 1 The 5 extremely halophilous genera form a monophyletic branch for all K=3 to 7. The one not listed in TOBA is marked by an asterisk.\n\nA monophyletic branch made of 11 species, to be denoted as A2.3 (11) . Not-fully classified taxa are marked by asterisk.\n\nConvergence of a phylum level monophyletic cluster containing 28 organisms, to be denoted as A2(28) in Figure 5 .\n\nThermoprotei (A1=1), so only distinctive orders make sense. Among the 17 organisms listed under A1=1 according to TOBA or NCBI taxonomy, 16 form a monophyletic cluster with Candidatus Korarchaeum mixed in, as shown in Figure 4 . The latter was supposed to belong to a new Archaea phylum Korarchaeota. However, Figure 4 shows that it may well be a new order within A1=1 or a new class under A1. This monophyletic cluster will be denoted by A1(16)+Kor in further reduced trees ( Figure 5 ). Now we come to the final Archaea trees containing all 56 organisms. The above reduction process has brought the trees to a simple and comprehensible form, as shown in Figure 5 . The remarkable fact that they do form a monophyletic cluster (within trees representing 861 genomes) justifies the introduction of a new domain for Archaea [1] .\n\nHowever, in Figure 5 the two entries marked by an asterisk as well as class A2.5(3) call for further scrutiny. In all CVTrees for all K values and organism numbers class A2.5 always stays within phylum Crenarchaeota (A1) in agreement with the classification scheme given in the book Five Kingdoms [20] but contradicts TOBA and the All-Species Living Tree [13] where it stably joins the phylum Euryarchaeota (A2) as a sister group to the Thermococci (A2.6). This persistent cross-phylum disagreement between CVTree and 16S rRNA phylogenies remains a test case awaiting further study.\n\nThe hyperthermophile Nanoarchaeum equitans is the only representative of a newly proposed phylum Nanoarchaeota [21] . Its position in CVTrees given in Figure 5 shows that the introduction of a new phylum might be an appropriate but not the only way of interpreting the highest-rank branchings of the 56 Archaea.\n\nThe placement of Nitrosopumilus maritimus, the only marine nitrifying archaea with genome sequenced so far, brings about some controversy. It is not listed either in TOBA or in the All-Species Living Tree [13] . The NCBI lineage puts it in phylum Crenarchaeota (A1), but all CVTrees indicate that it is closer to Euryarchaeote (A2).\n\nWe summarize the CVTree-based taxonomic suggestions for future verification:\n\n(i) Nitrosopumilus maritimus SCM1 might belong to A2.? (a new class in A2) instead of A1=1.? (a new order in A1).\n\n( We hope this summary may serve as a checklist for partial verification of the CVTree phylogeny with the traditional approaches in the domain of Archaea. As the placement of higher taxon represented by a single genome usually tends to be more sensible to adding new organisms to the tree, further improvement of the predictions is expected with progress of more sequencing projects.\n\nIn fact, the rapid advance of the next generation sequencing technology will soon reduce the cost of obtaining a prokaryotic genome to the order of, say, 10 US dollars. This will drastically change the practice of how to identify a bacterial species and how to determine its phylogenetic position in the spirit of the genomic-phylogenetic species concept [22] . Instead of doing DNA hybridization or extracting ribosomal RNAs, one may obtain and submit its genomic sequence to a phylogenetic platform such as the CVTree Web Server [17] at much less cost. In this sense we hope that CVTree could become a determinative tool in bacteriology in the not-too-distant future.\n\nAs of 31 May, 2009 there had appeared 6 additional Archaea genomes, increasing the total number of Archaea genomes from 56 to 62. All new genomes come from strains of one and the same species Sulfolobus islandicus. They do form a monophyletic branch for K=3 to 7. The addition of these 6 new genomes does not affect the conclusion of this paper, only changing Sulfolobus (3) to Sufolobus (9) in the genus tree, A1=1.4(4) to A1=1.4 (10) in Figure 4 , and A1 (16) to A1 (22) in Figure 5 ."}
