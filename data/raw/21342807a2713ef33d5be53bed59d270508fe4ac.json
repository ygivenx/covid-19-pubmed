{"title": "Antimicrobial dosing considerations in obese adult patients", "body": "As pandemic infl uenza H1N1 spread around the world in 2009, disease severity was one of the main areas of interest. The case fatality ratio (CFR) is a representative measurement of severity of a disease that directly captures virulence (ie, the conditional risk of death for patients with a disease or infection), whereas mortality (ie, the risk of death in a population) depends not only on the disease severity but also the risk of infection in a population. Because there have been several confl icting estimates of the CFR for pandemic H1N1, 1-6 I off er an interpretation of these reports and identify key areas that need to be clarifi ed.\n\nIn the early stages of the 2009 infl uenza pandemic, two approaches were taken when calculating the CFR. One approach focused on estimation of CFR during the course of the pandemic. 1-3 During outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome from 2002 to 2003, use of a crude ratio of the cumulative number of deaths to the number of cases at a given point in time underestimated the CFR. 7 To avoid similar underestimations, accounting for the time delay from onset of disease to death, the confi rmed CFR of pandemic H1N1, which took confi rmed cases as the denominator, was estimated to be about 0\u00b75%. 1-3,6 However, because the estimate depends on the proportion of symptomatic patients who have confi rmatory diagnosis, it is not useful for prediction of the overall mortality. 6 In other words, the diffi culty in case ascertainment remains a limitation of confi rmed CFR. Motivated by this limitation, the second approach calculated the CFR by taking symptomatic cases as the denominator, although in this study the denominator was not clearly defi ned. 4 Despite several technical problems, this approach emphasised the importance of accounting for unconfi rmed cases to yield an appropriate order of the CFR estimate (fi gure 1). 4 Subsequent to these earlier eff orts, Presanis and colleagues 5 have off ered a way to predict the mortality in a population, by explicitly taking symptomatic cases as the denominator and thus calculating the symptomatic CFR. The symptomatic CFR among all medically attended cases was estimated to be 0\u00b7048%, one-tenth of the CFR estimate from confi rmed cases. In other words, only one of ten symptomatic cases seems to have been confi rmed. By use of self-reported infl uenza-like illness as the denominator, the estimate was even smaller. Presanis and colleagues 5 and a later study in the UK 8 have adeptly shown that 2009 pandemic H1N1 infl uenza can be subjectively perceived as mild.\n\nCaution is needed when interpreting age-specifi c estimates (fi gure 2). The confi rmed CFR in Mexico 9 and the USA 10 increases with age, most probably because underlying medical conditions that can increase the risk of infl uenza death are most common in elderly people. 10, 11 The similar age-specifi c pattern is also seen in symptomatic CFR. 8 The diff ering CFR estimates between age-groups hamper precise estimation for entire populations during the early stages of the pandemic. 12 Furthermore, although there might be two countries with very diff erent CFR estimates, comparisons will be futile unless the composition of the cases (ie, age-groups and risk-groups of fatal and non-fatal cases) is known. The best way to describe the severity of pandemic infl uenza to non-experts is to compare its virulence with that of other infl uenza epidemics. However, because diff erent methods have been used to predict the mortality impact associated with pandemic H1N1 and non-pandemic infl uenza, the strict comparison of virulence has been diffi cult. Estimations of mortality for non-pandemic infl uenza have been made mainly with Serfl ing cyclical regression, 13 which accounts for deaths that are both directly and indirectly associated with infl uenza. A recent study in the USA suggested that there were up to 44 100 excess deaths in May to December, 2009, 14 implying that the mortality eff ect of the infl uenza pandemic surpassed that of non-pandemic infl uenza seasons. However, because this estimate of excess mortality refl ects both transmission potential and virulence, a comparative assessment of virulence alone has yet to be established.\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned issues surrounding the estimation of CFR, pharmaceutical interventions such as antiretroviral treatment or immunisation programmes also bias the estimated risk of death. Thus, to provide an unbiased CFR for the 2009 infl uenza pandemic that can accurately represent the overall virulence and permit comparisons within and between populations, we are faced with a challenge to adjust for such potential treatment eff ects that may require substantial epidemiological and statistical eff orts.\n\nJapan Science and Technology Agency, Saitama, Japan; and Theoretical Epidemiology, University of Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands h.nishiura@uu.nl I declare that I have no confl icts of interest.
