The prospects of substantial progress appeared dim because of the 143 extreme sequence divergence among RNA viruses, which could amount to irrevocable loss of 144 evolutionary information. 145\n\nRecent revolutionary developments in virus metagenomics (metaviromics) dramatically 146 expanded the known diversity of RNA viruses and provided an unprecedented amount of 147 sequence data for informed investigation into RNA virus evolution (11, 17, 37). The foremost 148 development was the massive expansion of the known invertebrate virome that was achieved 149 primarily through meta-transcriptome sequencing of various holobionts. The subsequent 150 phylogenetic analysis revealed previously unknown lineages of +RNA and -RNA viruses and 151 prompted reconsideration of high rank virus unifications, such as +RNA virus supergroups (14, 152 38-41). The RNA viromes of fungi and prokaryotes also underwent notable expansion albeit not 153 as massive as that of invertebrates (13, 42, 43) . 154\n\nHere we reexamine the evolutionary relationships among and within the 3 Baltimore Classes 155 of RNA viruses through a comprehensive analysis of the available genomic and metagenomic 156 sequences. In particular, to build a phylogenetic tree of thousands of viral RdRps, we designed RdRp sequences (Data set S1) and 1,028 RT sequences organized in 50+2 clusters (50 clusters 180 of RdRps and 2 clusters of RTs; see Materials and Methods for details). This sequence set did 181 not include RdRps of members of the families Birnaviridae or Permutatetraviridae, distinct 182 groups of RNA viruses that encompass a circular permutation within the RdRp Palm domain 183 (46) and therefore could not be confidently included in the alignment over their entire lengths. 184 All rights reserved.

At the lowest level, full 186 complements of sequences from each cluster were used to construct cluster-specific trees. At the 187 intermediate level, up to 15 representatives from each cluster were selected to elucidate 188 supergroup-level phylogeny. At the highest level, up to 5 representatives from each cluster were 189 taken to resolve global relationships (Data set S3A and S4). The final tree (Data set S2) was 190 assembled by replacing the cluster representatives with the trees from the previous steps. 191\n\nThe large number and immense diversity of the viruses included in our analysis create 192 serious challenges for a systematic, phylogeny-based nomenclature of the identified evolutionary 193 lineages of RNA viruses. Many such lineages consist of viruses newly discovered by 194 metaviromics, are not yet formally classified by the International Committee on Taxonomy of 195 Viruses (ICTV), and therefore, cannot be assigned formal names. For the purpose of the present 196 work, we adopted a semi-arbitrary naming scheme using the following approach. 1) We use 197 taxon names that have been fully accepted by the ICTV as of March 2018 (47) whenever 198 possible. These names are recognizable through their capitalization and italicization and rank-199 specific suffixes (e.g., -virales for orders, -viridae for families). As is the common practice in 200 virus taxonomy, the officially classified members of each ICTV-approved taxon are referred to 201 via vernaculars (recognizable through their lack of capitalization and italicization). For instance, 202 the members of the ICTV-approved order Bunyavirales are called bunyaviruses, whereas those 203 of the family Tombusviridae are called tombusviruses. However, in this work, both taxon and 204 vernacular terms are to be understood sensu lato: if our analysis indicates certain viruses to be 205 members of or very closely related to an ICTV-established taxon, we consider them members of 206 that taxon despite the lack of current ICTV recognition.

Whenever possible, we use names that circulate in the literature (e.g., 210\n\n\"hepeliviruses\", \"statoviruses\"). In the absence of such unofficial names, we name the lineage 211 reminiscent of the next closely related lineage (e.g., \"levi-like viruses\" are a clearly distinct sister 212 group to Leviviridae/leviviruses). 3) Monophyletic clusters that transcend the currently highest 213 ICTV-accepted rank (i.e., order) are labeled according to terms circulating in the literature (i.e., 214 \"alphavirus supergroup\", \"flavivirus supergroup\", and \"picornavirus supergroup\"). 4) Lineages 215\n\nrepresented by a single virus are labeled with the respective virus name. 216\n\nRooting the phylogenetic tree, generated using PhyML (48), between the RTs and RdRps 217 resulted in a well-resolved topology of RNA viruses which the tree splits into 5 major branches, 218 each including substantial diversity of viruses ( Figure 1 ). 219\n\nBranch 1: leviviruses and their eukaryotic relatives, namely, \"mitoviruses\", \"narnaviruses\" 220 and \"ourmiaviruses\" (the latter three terms are placed in quotation marks as our analysis 221 contradicts the current ICTV framework, which considers mitoviruses and narnaviruses members 222 of one family, Narnaviridae, and ourmiaviruses members of a free-floating genus Ourmiavirus); 223\n\nBranch 2 (\"picornavirus supergroup\"): a large assemblage of +RNA viruses of eukaryotes, in 224 particular, those of the orders Picornavirales and Nidovirales, the families Caliciviridae, 225\n\nPotyviridae, Astroviridae, and Solemoviridae, a lineage of dsRNA viruses including 226 partitiviruses and picobirnaviruses; and several other, smaller groups of +RNA and dsRNA 227 viruses. 228 All rights reserved.

Given the poor resolution of the RAxML tree and a 266 strong biological argument, namely, the absence of identified -RNA viruses in prokaryotes or 267 protists (with the exception of the \"leishbuviruses\" infecting kinetoplastids (49, 50); see also 268 discussion below), we believe that the tree topology in Figure 1 carries more credence than that 269 shown in Data set S3B.

The only protein that is likely to have been gained at the base of the 287 eukaryotic virus subtree (Branches 2 to 5) (that also includes the bacterial cystoviruses) is the 288 single jelly-roll capsid protein (SJR-CP) ( Figure S2A ).

These replicons consist of a single RdRp gene (Fig.  299 2B) and replicate either in mitochondria or in the cytosol of the host cells, respectively, of fungal 300 and invertebrate hosts (the latter hosts were identified in metaviromic holobiont analyses) (14, 301 53) . Recently, the existence of plant \"mitoviruses\" has been reported although it is not known 302 whether these viruses reproduce in the mitochondria (54). The \"narnavirus\" RdRp is also the 303 ancestor of the RdRp of the expanding group of \"ourmiaviruses\" (Figure 2A ). \"Ourmiaviruses\" 304 were originally identified in a narrow range of plants, and genomic analysis revealed the 305 chimeric nature of these viruses, with a \"narnavirus\"-like RdRp but SJR-CPs and movement 306 proteins (MPs) which were apparently acquired from \"picorna-like\" and \"tombus-like\" viruses, 307 respectively (55). Use of metaviromics has led to the identification of numerous related viruses 308 associated with invertebrates, many of which encode distinct SJR-CP variants and some of which 309 acquired an RNA helicase ( Figure 2B and S2) (14) . Thus, the evolution of this branch apparently 310 involved the loss of the structural module of leviviruses, which yielded naked RNA replicons 311 that reproduced in the mitochondria of early eukaryotes. A group of these replicons subsequently 312 escaped to the cytosol which was followed by the reacquisition of unrelated structural modules 313 from distinct lineages of eukaryotic viruses inhabiting the same environment ( Figure 2B The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/451740 doi: bioRxiv preprint groups that were previously considered peripheral members of this supergroup, such as 320 totiviruses and nodaviruses, were relocated to different branches in the present tree (Branches 4 321 and 3, respectively), whereas the viruses of the order Nidovirales were moved inside Branch 2 322 from an uncertain position in the tree. Nevertheless, the core of the supergroup remains coherent, 323 suggestive of common ancestry.

This observation emphasizes 366 a major tendency in virus evolution: increase in genome complexity via gradual acquisition of 367 accessory genes (72). 368\n\nApart from the SJR-CP, an apparently ancestral protein that is likely to be a shared derived 369 character (synapomorphy) of Branch 2 is a serine protease that is present in members of the order 370\n\nPicornavirales (with the diagnostic substitution of cysteine for the catalytic serine), members of 371 the potyvirus-astrovirus clade, solemoviruses, alvernavirus, and nidoviruses ( Figure 3B and 372 S2B). As demonstrated previously, this viral protease derives from a distinct bacterial protease, 373\n\nprobably of mitochondrial origin, which is compatible with an early origin of Branch 2 in 374 eukaryotic evolution (31). 375\n\nThe reconstruction of protein gain-loss, together with the comparison of genome 376 architectures in this branch, reveal extensive rearrangements as well as gene and module 377 displacement ( Figure 3B and S2B). Branch 2 includes viruses with relatively long genomes and 378 complex gene repertoires (nidoviruses, potyviruses and many members of Picornavirales) along 379 with viruses with much shorter genomes and minimal sets of genes (astroviruses and 380 solemoviruses). Clearly, evolution of Branch 2 viruses involved multiple gene gains. Of special 381 note is the gain of 3 distinct helicases in 3 clades within this branch: superfamily 3 helicases 382 (S3H) in members of Picornavirales, superfamily 2 helicases (S2H) in potyviruses, and 383 superfamily 1 helicases (S1H) in nidoviruses ( Figure 3B and S2B). This independent, convergent 384 gain of distinct helicases reflects the trend noticed early in the study of RNA virus evolution, 385 namely, that most viruses with genomes longer than ~6 kb encode helicases, whereas smaller 386 ones do not. This difference conceivably exists because helicase activity is required for the 387 replication of longer RNA genomes (73). Another notable feature is the change of virion 388 All rights reserved.

In contrast, virion architectures vary dramatically even within each of the three lineages of 413 the \"alphavirus supergroup\". The major structural themes include: variants of icosahedral capsids 414 formed by SJR-CP (e.g., bromoviruses, tymoviruses); unrelated icosahedral capsids enveloped in 415 a lipoprotein bilayer (togaviruses); flexuous filamentous capsids formed by a distinct type of CP 416 (alphaflexiviruses, betaflexiviruses, gammaflexiviruses, closteroviruses); and rigid rod-shaped 417 capsids assembled from another distinct CP (benyiviruses, virgaviruses). It was traditionally 418 thought that the latter capsid type is specific to viruses of flowering plants (20). However, the 419 recent discovery of a virgavirus-like CP in invertebrate viruses (e.g., B\u011bih\u01cei charybdis crab virus 420 1 in Figure 4B ) (14) suggests that the emergence of this unique CP fold antedates land The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/451740 doi: bioRxiv preprint Within Branch 3, the phylogenetically compact alphavirus supergroup is embedded within 433 the radiation of diverse virus groups including the well-known tombusviruses and nodaviruses, 434 along with several newcomers discovered via metaviromics, such as the \"statovirus\", \"w\u00e8ivirus\", 435 \"y\u00e0nvirus\", and \"zh\u00e0ovirus\" groups (14, 80, 81) ( Figure 4A ). Our RdRp analysis revealed 436 remarkable phylogenetic heterogeneity within and among these groups and split \"tombus-like 437 viruses\" into 5 lineages with distinct evolutionary affinities (groups 'Uncl. inv.', and subsets of 438 \"tombus-like viruses\" and \"nodaviruses\" in Figure 4A ). This subdivision is also supported by the 439 analysis of the CPs of these viruses (see section on SJR-CP evolution; Fig. 7 ). Therefore, in 440 contrast to the alphavirus supergroup, nodaviruses or flavivirus supergroup, the term 'tombus-441 like' loses its evolutionary and taxonomic coherence. Accordingly, we use the term 442 \"tombusviruses\" (without quotation marks) only for one lineage that includes the members of the 443 current family Tombusviridae along with a broad variety of related plant and invertebrate 444 holobiont viruses (14) . 445\n\nThe previously suggested, tenuous Flaviviridae-Tombusviridae affinity is gone in the present 446 tree although members of both families belong to the same major Branch 3. Plant tombusviruses 447 (and members of closely related plant virus genera), the only group of \"tombus-like viruses\" that 448 was available at the time of previous analyses (7, 21), now form but a small twig deep within the 449 large assemblage we refer to as tombusviruses. Tombusviruses are affiliated with \"statoviruses\" 450 (80) and a subset of unclassified viruses from invertebrate holobionts rather than with 451 flaviviruses ( Figure 4A) . Flaviviruses now form a separate clade within Branch 3, the flavivirus 452 supergroup that includes members of four recognized flaviviral genera (Pegivirus, Hepacivirus, 453\n\nFlavivirus, and Pestivirus), the newly discovered \"j\u012bngm\u00e9nviruses\" with segmented genomes 454 (38) and a variety of unclassified, extremely divergent \"flavi-like viruses\" of animals and plants. 455 All rights reserved.

At a greater 571 phylogenetic distance, CPs of astroviruses and hepeviruses are closely related despite them being 572 affiliated to Branches 2 and 3, respectively, suggesting CP gene replacement in the ancestor of 573 one of the two families. Given that the CPs of hepeviruses connect to SJR-CPs of other viruses 574 through astroviruses, CP gene replacement most likely occurred in the ancestor of hepeviruses 575 ( Figure S3) . Notably, the CPs of \"zh\u00e0oviruses\", \"w\u00e8iviruses\", and \"tombus-like\" and \"solemo-576 like viruses\" (diverse virus assemblage within solemovirus branch, to the exclusion of bona fide 577 Solemoviridae) did not form discrete clusters but rather were affiliated with diverse virus groups, 578 suggesting extensive recombination in these viruses, with multiple CP gene exchanges ( Figure  579 7). In the case of unclassified \"narnaviruses\" and \"ourmiaviruses\", the CP genes apparently have 580 been acquired on more than 3 independent occasions from different groups of viruses, 581 emphasizing the impact of recombination and gene shuffling in the evolution of RNA viruses.

The supermodules of RNA viruses failed to attain 608 statistical significance due to the small number of shared genes but nevertheless, some notable 609 connections are revealed by this analysis. Specifically, 8 overlapping supermodules were 610 identified ( Figure 8C ). The largest and, arguably, most remarkable is a supermodule that 611 combines +RNA, dsRNA and -RNA viruses that share the capping enzymes, S1H (with the 612 exception of Reoviridae and Mononegavirales) and additional connector genes (e.g., the OTU 613 family protease) that link some of the constituent modules.

Notably, such a merger seems to have occurred on 632 at least three other independent occasions in Branch 1 because several groups of invertebrate 633 holobiont \"narnaviruses\" and some \"ourmiaviruses\" encode distantly related SJR-CPs that 634 apparently were acquired from different groups of plant and animal viruses (Figure 7) . 635\n\nThe case of cystoviruses is less clear given that this clade is sandwiched between eukaryotic 636 viruses in Branch 4 and therefore does not seem to be a good candidate for the ancestor of this 637\n\nbranch. It appears more likely that the ancestor was a toti-like virus, whereas cystoviruses are 638 derived forms, which implies virus transfer from eukaryotes to prokaryotes.

No known prokaryotic viruses are classified in Branch 640 2 but it has been proposed that picobirnaviruses, for which no hosts have been reliably identified, 641 actually are prokaryotic viruses. This proposal is based on the conspicuous conservation of 642 functional, bacterial-type, ribosome-binding sites (Shine-Dalgarno sequences) in picobirnavirus 643 genomes (107, 108). Should that be the case, viruses of prokaryotes might be lurking among 644 totiviruses as well. Then, Branch 4 would stem from a prokaryotic ancestor avoiding the need to 645 invoke virus transfer from eukaryotes to prokaryotes to explain the origin of the cystoviruses. 646\n\nWe made an attempt to quantify the potential horizontal virus transfer (HVT) events in RNA 647 viruses that represent the 5 major branches of the RdRp tree. The leaves of the tree were labeled 648 with the known hosts, the entropy of the host ranges for each subtree was calculated, and the 649 resulting values were plotted against the distance from the root (Figure 9 ). By design, for all 650 branches, entropy (host diversity) drops from the maximum values at the root to zero at the 651 leaves. All branches show substantial host range diversity such that, for example, at half-distance 652 from root to leaves, all branches, except for Branch 1, retain at least half of the diversity (Figure  653 9). Furthermore, differences between the branches are substantial, with the highest entropy 654 observed in branches 4 (dsRNA viruses) and 5 (-RNA viruses). With all the caveats due to 655 potential errors and ambiguities in host assignment, this analysis strongly suggests that HVT 656 played an important role in the evolution of all major groups of RNA viruses. 657\n\nAll rights reserved.

We reasoned that this expansion of the 662 RNA virosphere could provide for an improved understanding of virus evolution. Although 663 further progress of metaviromics and enhanced phylogenomic methods will undoubtedly change 664 current ideas, we believe that some key aspects of RNA virus evolution are indeed coming into 665 focus. 666\n\nThe expanded diversity of RNA viruses combined with the iterative procedure for 667 phylogenetic analysis allowed us to obtain a tree of all RdRps and the most closely related RTs 668 in which the main branches are strongly supported and thus appear to be reliable (Figure 1 ). To 669 our knowledge, the picture of RNA virus evolution emerging from the tree has not been 670 presented previously. The tree seems to clarify the relationships between the 3 Baltimore Classes 671 of RNA viruses by revealing the nested tree structure in which dsRNA viruses evolved, on at 672 least two occasions, from +RNA viruses, whereas -RNA viruses evolved from a distinct group of 673 dsRNA viruses. 674\n\nThe derivation of -RNA viruses from dsRNA viruses is, arguably, the most unexpected 675 outcome of the present analysis, considering the lack of genes (other than the RdRp) shared by 676 these virus classes. Clearly, given that the primary evidence behind the derivation of -RNA 677 viruses from within dsRNA viruses comes from deep phylogeny, extreme caution is due in the 678 interpretation of this observation. However, the pronounced similarity between the 3D structures 679 of the RdRps of the -RNA influenza virus A and bacteriophage \uf0666 dsRNA cystovirus (35) is 680 compatible with our findings.

Notably, similar levels of complexity, with the complete coding 710 capacity of 20 to 40 kb, were reached independently in 4 branches of the RdRp tree, namely, 711\n\nBranch 2 (coronaviruses), Branch 3 (closteroviruses and flaviviruses), Branch 4 (reoviruses), and 712\n\nBranch 5 (filoviruses and paramyxoviruses) (Figure 3-6) . 713\n\nGene exchange and shuffling of gene modules are important factors of RNA virus evolution. 714\n\nFor example, it appears that all dsRNA viruses in the two major clades within Branches 2 and 4 715 share homologous structural modules that combine with distinct RdRps. At least in the case of 716 partiti-picobirnaviruses in Branch 2, the dsRNA virus (\"toti-like virus\") CP apparently displaced 717 the ancestral SJR-CP. However, this particular protein structure does not seem to be essential to 718 encapsidate a dsRNA genome: birnaviruses, whose provenance is uncertain due to the 719 permutation in their RdRps, retain SJR-CP, which is most closely related to SJR-CP of 720 nodaviruses and tetraviruses (19). An even more striking example of module shuffling is 721 presented by amalgaviruses, dsRNA viruses that group with partitiviruses in the RdRp tree but 722 encode a distant homolog of the nucleocapsid protein of -RNA bunyaviruses (111-114). More 723 generally, structural and replication modules have been repeatedly shuffled during the evolution 724 of +RNA viruses. Examples include displacement of the ancestral SJR-CP by a filamentous CP 725 in potyviruses and by a helical nucleocapsid protein in nidoviruses, and multiple cases of 726 displacement with rod-shaped-like CP and unique nucleocapsid proteins in Branch 3.

The evolutionary relationships between viruses with distinct host ranges are supported 745 not only by the phylogeny of the RdRp, but also by the fact that these viruses share additional 746 conserved domains, such as, for example, SJR1, S3H and 3C-Pro in the case of Picornavirales 747 members infecting protists, plants, fungi, invertebrates and vertebrates (Fig. 3) . 748\n\nInvertebrates are particularly promiscuous hosts for viruses, often sharing the same virus 749 group with distantly related organisms.

In addition to invertebrates that appear to be dominant HVT agents, fungi could also play an 763 important role in HVT within the global RNA virome. Indeed, fungi that are tightly associated 764 with plants and insects often share closely related viruses with these organisms (116-118). 765\n\nFurthermore, an indisputable case of cross-kingdom transfer of an insect iflavirus to an 766 entomopathogenic fungus has been recently described (119). 767\n\nThese findings appear to be best compatible with a grand evolutionary scenario ( Figure 10 ) 768 in which the ancestor of the eukaryotic RNA virome was a levi/narnavirus-like naked RNA 769 replicon that originally reproduced in mitochondria and combined with a host carbohydrate-770 binding SJR protein (19) or a preexisting SJR-CP from a DNA virus to form a simple ancestral 771 virus. Given that viruses of Branches 2, 3, and 4 are present in modern protists, it appears likely 772 that these branches emerged in early eukaryotes.

The expansion of the global RNA virome thanks to the advances of metaviromics, combined 790 with the phylogenomics results, seem to call for an overhaul of the current virus taxonomy on 791 multiple levels. Most importantly, creation of a coherent, hierarchical system with multiple 792 taxonomic ranks seems to be imminent. This process has already started with the proposal of a 793 phylum rank for -RNA viruses, for which monophyly is unequivocally supported by the present 794 analysis (Figures 1 and 6) . This phylum could consist of two subphyla with multiple classes and 795 orders. At least 4 additional phyla of RNA viruses can be confidently predicted to emerge, 796 All rights reserved.

Each of these phyla will undoubtedly have a rich internal structure. In addition, some of the 798 current families do not seem to be compatible with the expansive RdRp trees present here and in 799 a previous analysis (14) . For instance, the families Coronaviridae, Togaviridae and 800\n\nRhabdoviridae are likely to be split into two families each. 801\n\nWhile the present study was in preparation, a major attempt on a comprehensive virus 802 classification has been published (121). This work analyzed a dendrogram that was produced 803 from distance matrices between viruses derived from sequence similarity scores combined with 804 measures of gene composition similarity. . Unlike our present analysis, this approach pre-805 supposes monophyly of each of the Baltimore classes. Furthermore, given that their analysis is 806 based on measures of similarity rather than on phylogenetic analysis proper, this approach is best 807 regarded as producing a phenetic classification of viruses rather that an evolutionary 808 reconstruction as such. Some of the groups delineated by this method, particularly, among +RNA 809 viruses, are closely similar to those reported here. Others, however, are widely different: for 810 instance, the order Mononegavirales does not come across as monophyletic in their 811 dendrograms. We did not attempt a complete comparison; such an exercise could be useful in the 812 future, for better understanding the routes of RNA virus evolution. 813\n\nThrough metaviromics, many aspects of the global RNA virome evolution can be clarified. 816\n\nCertainly, reconstruction of the deepest events in this evolutionary history is bound to remain 817 tentative, especially, because the RdRp is the only universal gene of the RNA viruses, and hence, 818 the only one that can serve as the template for evolutionary reconstructions.

Extracted RdRp footprints were filtered for the fraction of unresolved amino acids (at most 856 10%) and clustered using UCLUST (125) with a similarity threshold of 0.9. One representative 857 from each cluster was selected for further analysis. The resulting set contained 4,640 virus 858\n\nRdRps. This set went through several rounds of semi-manual curation whereby sequences were 859 clustered using UCLUST, aligned using MUSCLE (126), and cross-searched against each other 860 and their parent sequences (often, complete viral polyproteins) using PSI-BLAST and 861 HHSEARCH (127). Upon the results of these searches, the boundaries of the RdRp domain were 862 expanded or trimmed to improve their compatibility with each other. 863 All rights reserved.

Sites containing more than 67% 867 of gaps were temporarily removed from alignments and pairwise similarity scores were obtained 868 for clusters using HHSEARCH. Scores for a pair of clusters were converted to distances (the 869 d A,B = -log(s A,B /min(s A,A ,s B,B ) formula, in which d A,B is the distance between cluster A and B and 870 s A,B is the HHSEARCH score for the comparison of these clusters, was used to convert scores s 871 to distances d). The matrix of pairwise distances was used to make an unweighted pair group 872 method with arithmetic (UPGMA) mean (128). Shallow tips of the tree were used as the guide 873 tree for a progressive pairwise alignment of the clusters at the tree leaves using HHALIGN 874 (127), resulting in larger clusters. This procedure was reiterative, ultimately resulting in the 875 single alignment of the whole set of 4,640 virus RdRp sequences and 1,028 RT sequences. 876\n\nDuring the clustering procedure, 50 virus RdRp clusters, consisting of 1 to 545 sequences, 877 were defined. These clusters represent either well-established groups of related viruses (roughly 878 comparable to the ICTV family rank) or, in case of poorly characterized and unclassified viruses, 879 groups of well-aligned RdRps that are clearly distinct from others. In all cases, uncertainties 880 were treated conservatively, i.e., in favor of placing sequences with questionable relatedness into 881 separate clusters. Additionally, RT sequences were placed into two clusters consisting of group-882 II intron RTs and non-LTR retrotransposon RTs. 883\n\nFor each cluster consisting of more than two sequences, an approximate maximum likelihood 884 (ML) phylogenetic tree was constructed from the cluster-specific alignment using the FastTree 885 program (129) (Whelan and Goldman [WAG] evolutionary model with gamma-distributed site 886 All rights reserved.

Trees were 887 rooted using a variant of the mid-point rooting procedure such that the difference between the 888 (weighted) average root-to-tip distances in the subtrees on the opposite sides of the root is 889 minimized. 890\n\nTo resolve the structure of the global relationships, up to five representatives from each 891 cluster were selected using the within-cluster trees to ensure the diversity of the selected 892 sequences. This procedure resulted in a set of 228 virus RdRps and 10 RTs. The alignments of 893 the selected sequences were extracted from the master alignment and filtered for sites containing 894 more than 50% of gaps. A ML phylogenetic tree was reconstructed for the resulting alignment 895 using PhyML (48) (Le Gascuel [LG] evolutionary model with gamma-distributed site rates and 896 empirical amino acid frequencies; aBayes support values). Another form of branch support, 897 bootstrap support by transfer (BOOSTER) phylogenetic bootstrap (130), was also used to assess 898 the reliability of the major tree divisions. Alternatively, the same RdRp alignment was used as 899 the input for ML phylogenetic analysis using RAxML (LG evolutionary model with gamma-900 distributed site rates and empirical amino acid frequencies). 901\n\nRdRps in the global tree were divided into 5 major branches (supergroups). Up to 15 902 representatives from each cluster were selected to form supergroup-level alignments. Respective 903 trees were reconstructed from these alignments using the same procedure (PhyML tree with LG 904 evolutionary model with gamma-distributed site rates and empirical amino acid frequencies). 905\n\nThe overall tree was assembled manually by first replacing the supergroup representatives in 906 the global tree with the supergroup trees, and then, replacing the cluster representatives with the 907 cluster trees. The lower-level trees were rooted according to the arrangement of the 908 representatives in the upper-level tree. 909"}
