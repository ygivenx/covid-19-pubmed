{"title": "Estimating the maximum daily number of incident COVID-19 cases manageable by a healthcare system", "body": "The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic originated in China in late 2019 and continues to spread globally. 1 At the time of writing, there were over 260,000 COVID-19 cases causing close to 12,000 deaths across more than 185 affected countries and territories. 2 As healthcare systems like those in Northern Italy approach collapse, there is a pressing need for tools modeling the capacity of acute and critical care systems during the COVID-19 pandemic. 3\n\nTo develop an online tool capable of estimating the maximum daily number of incident COVID-19 cases that a healthcare system could manage given age-based case distribution and severity.\n\nWe modeled steady-state patient-flow dynamics for acute care beds, critical care beds, and mechanical ventilators during the COVID-19 pandemic. 4 Parameters for patient-flow dynamics were extracted from evolving data on COVID-19 and assumptions based on expert guidance, but were left modifiable in the tool for users to adjust based upon local experience. We used the package shiny within R (version 3.5.3) to create the interactive tool.\n\nThe tool determines the maximum daily number of incident COVID-19 cases (\"patients in\") which would equal the maximum daily turnover of acute care beds, critical care beds, and mechanical ventilators available and/or used for COVID-19 patients (\"patients out\")-this is the steady state which could be maximally managed by a healthcare system.

Based on published data, the average length of stay in acute care was set at 11 days, the average length of stay in critical care was set at 20 days, and the average length of time for mechanical ventilation was set at 20 days. 1, 5 The tool then calculates the population-weighted expected probabilities of acute care hospitalization and critical care admissions for COVID-19 infections; we assumed that 50% of critical care patients would require mechanical ventilation. 5, 6 Finally, the maximum daily number of incident COVID-19 cases that a healthcare system could manage is calculated by dividing the daily turnover of maximally available acute care beds, critical care beds or mechanical ventilators by the probability of those resources being used among COVID-19 cases.\n\nWhile the tool can be used in any region, default parameters for age-based case distribution and severity were set using data from the United States, while parameters for acute and critical care resource availability were set for Canada's most populous province of Ontario (see Appendix 1). 6\n\nThe COVID-19 Acute and Intensive Care Resource Tool (CAIC-RT) is open-access and published online, available at https://caic-rt.shinyapps.io/CAIC-RT.

Unlike forecasting tools, our tool has the advantage of determining a sustainable threshold for resource utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic rather than forecasting when resources might become depleted based on assumptions about reporting, epidemic growth and reproduction numbers. .

Further, the tool can inform the required intensity for non-pharmaceutical societal interventions like physical distancing based on a healthcare system's proximity to the sustainable threshold.\n\nFinally, the tool allows for customization of age-based case distribution and severity which is essential for countries with differing population demographics and healthcare systems.\n\nLimitations of this tool include the assumption that COVID-19 cases become instantaneously hospitalized and the application of Canadian, Chinese and US data for default parameters which may not generalizable to all healthcare systems. Though we intentionally left the tool modifiable, we will update the default values as new data emerges, in order to account for the ramp-up of diagnostic testing in countries like the United States with the understanding that most of those tested will not be hospitalized.\n\nThe age-based case distribution and severity parameters took the midpoint of the lower and upper bound of ranges for hospitalization and ICU admission in the above table. \n\nWe determined the maximum daily number of incident COVID-19 cases which could be managed by a healthcare system. The tool uses steady state analysis and determines the maximum daily number of COVID-19 cases (\"patients in\") which would equal the maximum daily turnover of acute care beds, critical care beds, and mechanical ventilators (\"patients out\")-this represents the steady state which could be maximally managed by a healthcare system. Appendix 2 Figure 1 : Flowchart of incident COVID-19 cases entering and exiting a hospital.\n\nIn the example above we can see that within a given population there are incident cases (new COVID-19 cases). Some of these cases are hospitalized and enter the hospital. COVID-19 cases that are admitted leave the hospital either through discharge or death. The goal is to determine the maximum rate of incident cases that can occur in the population such that, given the hospital's maximum capacity, the rate of COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization is equal to the rate of COVID-19 patients leaving the hospital.\n\nWe calculate the rate of patients leaving the hospital by taking the number of COVID-19 patients at the hospital when at capacity by the average length-of-stay a patient spends at the hospital. It is important to note that the average/mean length-of-stay is to be used and not the median length-of-stay. This is referred to as the sojourn time and represents the turnover rate that occurs within hospital.\n\n.

Further, suppose the average length-of-stay for COVID-19 patients is 10 days. We can calculate the rate of COVID-19 patients leaving the hospital as: Therefore, given that there are 50 beds available for COVID-19 patients, and each patient stays 10 days on average, the expected rate of COVID-19 patients leaving the hospital is 5 patients per day.\n\nThe next step is to determine the proportion of COVID-19 patients that become hospitalized. Referring to Appendix 2 Figure 1 we determined what proportion of the incident cases (mid-blue circle) are hospitalized (dark-blue circle). The probability of being hospitalized given someone is a COVID-19 case is highly dependent on the age distribution of the case population. To perform this calculation, among cases we multiply the probability of being within an age-group by the probability of being hospitalized if someone is in that age group. The sum of all age-groups gives the overall probability of being hospitalized per case: .

Given what we calculated in Step 1 and Step 2, for the system to be steady-state: per day, of which 5 will be admitted to hospital, and 5 COVID-19 patients leaving the hospital either through discharge or death.\n\nIn this example we have demonstrated the application using acute care hospitalizations. This methodology can be applied to any resource of interest. In our online tool we apply it to acute care beds, critical care beds, and mechanical ventilators. For each resource one must know the average length-of-use per admitted COVID-19 patient (for the cases). It is important to use the average duration of use and not the median. It is also important to separate lengths of use as mutually exclusive and nonmutually exclusive when appropriate. For example, a patient is admitted to hospital, spends the first 5 days in acute care, 6 days in critical care (no intubation), followed by another 6 days in critical care intubated, another 2 days in critical care (no intubation), and 5 more days in acute care.

In our tool it is assumed that a ventilated patient is de facto in critical care. Therefore the number of ventilators should not exceed the number of critical care beds.\n\n.
