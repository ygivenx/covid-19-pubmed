{"title": "Discovering novel chemical inhibitors of human cyclophilin A: Virtual screening, synthesis, and bioassay", "body": "Cyclophilins were discovered originally for their high affinity against cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressive drug used to prevent allograft rejection. 1 The general biological function of cyclophilins is to catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of peptide bonds preceding proline in protein and peptides. 2 Of the 15 known human cyclophilins, cyclophilin A (hCypA) is one of the most important members and has been widely studied for mapping its biological functions. 3 In addition to a binding target of CsA, hCypA is able to enhance the rate of folding (or unfolding) of proteins via its peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) activity. 4 hCypA performs an essential function in HIV-1 replication by binding specifically with the capsid domain (CA) of the Gag polyprotein. 5 hCypA may also render neuroprotective/ neurotrophic effects 6 when presented at high levels in the brain. 7 Recently, it was discovered that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) can bind to hCyPA, which may be associated with SARS-CoV infection. 8 CypA has attracted considerable attention not only for its novel catalytic activity, but also for its therapeutic significance. It is reported that CypA-CsA binding might inhibit the serine/threonine phosphatase activity of calcineurin, thereby blocking the production of cytokines including interleukin-2 9 and interferon c. 10 The discovery of CsA more than two decades ago heralded a new era in the field of organ transplantation. Since then, the number of transplanted organs has grown continuously and the search for novel immuno-suppressants has intensified. 11 However, inhibitors of CypA are mainly derived from the natural sources (such as FK506, 12 rapamycin, 13 and sanglifehrin A 14 ) and peptide analogues, 15 which are all large molecules, and little has been reported regarding the small molecule CypA inhibitors.\n\nAlthough immunosuppressants like CsA have improved the rates of transplant success and prolonged patient survivals, some side effects with this agent have been sequentially found such as nephrotoxicity, 16 hypertension 17 , and cardiotoxicity. 18 This thereby prompted us to discover novel small molecule CypA inhibitors in order to decrease the side effects. Structure-based ligand design has led to the identification of compounds that are currently in clinical trials or into the market. 19 The wealth of structural and functional information of CypA 15 has offered a solid starting point for the rational structure-based design of inhibitors. By using dockingbased virtual screening approach in conjunction with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) determination, 15 novel small molecule CypA binders (hits) (compounds 1-15) have been discovered. According to the binding potency, structural similarity, and synthetic complexity, seven hits (compounds 1-6 and 15) were selected as the starting points for further structural optimization. Totally, 40 new compounds including 1-6 and 15 (the preparation methods for these seven compounds have not been reported) and their 33 analogues (16a-q, 17a-d, and 18a-l) have been synthesized and tested with biological assay. Finally, four compounds (16b, 16h, 16k, and 18g) were found to show high CypA PPIase (peptidyl-prolyl isomerase) inhibition activities and one compound (16h) is active in inhibiting the proliferation of spleen cells.\n\nSPECS database contains the structural information of 280,000 small molecules (http://www.specs.net). SPECS Company supplies all the compound samples collected from difference sources. First, SPECS database was evaluated using our own filter of druglikeness. 20 Nondruglike molecules were removed from the database, and finally 85,000 potentially druglike molecules were selected out for docking screening. These molecules were saved in the SPECS_1 database.\n\nThe crystal structure of CypA in complex with sanglifehrin macrolide (SFM) (PDB entry 1NMK) 14 recovered from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (http:// www.rcsb.org/pdb) was used as a target for virtual screening on the SPECS_1 database (http://www.specs.net). In the present study, the DOCK4.0 program 21 was employed for the primary screening. Residues of CypA around SFM at a radius of 6.5 \u00c5 were isolated for constructing the grids of the docking screening. The resulting substructure included all residues of the binding pocket. During the docking calculation, Kollman-allatom charges 22 were assigned to the protein and Gasteiger-Marsili partial charges 23 were assigned to the small molecules in the SPECS_1 database. Conformational flexibility of the compounds from the database was considered in the docking search.\n\nThe DOCK suite of programs is designed to find possible orientations of a ligand in a \u00d4receptor\u00d5 site. 21 The orientation of a ligand is evaluated with a shape scoring function and/or a function approximating the ligand-receptor binding energy. The shape scoring function is an empirical function resembling the van der Waals attractive energy. The ligand-receptor binding energy is taken to be approximately the sum of the van der Waals and electrostatic interaction energies. After the initial orientation and scoring evaluation, a grid-based rigid body minimization is carried out for the ligand to locate the nearest local energy minimum within the receptor binding site. The position and conformation of each docked molecule were optimized using single anchor search and torsion minimization method of DOCK4.0. 21 Thirty configurations per ligand building a cycle and 50 maximum anchor orientations were used in the anchor-first docking algorithm. All docked configurations were energy minimized using 100 maximum iterations and 1 minimization cycle.\n\nThe 5000 molecules with the highest score as obtained by DOCK search were re-scored by using the Consensus Score (CScore) 24 method encoded in Sybyl6.8. 25 The binding free energies and the binding modes of the top 1301 molecules with CScore P4 to CypA were calculated and modeled using the FlexX 26 program encoded in Sybyl6.8. 25 FlexX is a flexible docking method that uses an incremental construction algorithm to place ligand into an active site. By dividing the ligand into small fragments and building incrementally, the conformational flexibility of the ligand can be considered in reasonable times. The Kollman-all-atom charge 22 and Gasteiger-Marsili partial charge 23 were used for cyclophilin A and candidate molecules, respectively, in the FlexX simulations.\n\nFinally 82 compounds were distinguished and selected for bioassay on the basis of score by virtual screening and druglikeness analysis. The virtual screening was performed on a 128-processor SGI Origin 3800 supercomputer.\n\n2.3.1. Design of analogues of compounds 1-6, 15. Com-pounds1-6 and 15 ( Fig. 1 ) bearing the highest binding affinities with CypA as obtained by the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) determination (see Section 4) for the 82 candidate compounds selected by virtual screening were used as lead compounds for designing new CypA inhibitors. Based on the structural and enzyme binding activity features of compounds 1-6 and 15, 33 new analogues (16a-q, 17a-d, and 18a-l) (Tables 1 and 2) were designed and synthesized for the first round. Keeping the key groups of compounds 1-4-2-substituted quinoline ring and sulfanilamide moiety-we used various setric, electronic, and hydrophobic groups to substitute at position 2 of the quinoline ring in compounds 1-4 ( Fig. 1 ) and obtained 10 analogues (16a-j) ( Table 1) . Replacing the quinoline ring with a pyridine ring, we obtained seven compounds (16k-q) ( Table 1) . Keeping the key groups of compounds 5 and 6-phenyl alkyl acylamide and sulfanilamide moiety-we changed the length of the alkyl linkers, coupled with the sulfisoxazole of compound 1, and obtained four compounds (17a-d) ( Table 1) . On the basis of the structural features of compound 15, we designed compounds 18a-j (Table 2) , maintained dibenzoic acid or dibenzoic acid ester moiety, and replaced 3,5-dimethoxybenzamido group in compound 15 with other electronic and hydrophobic substituted benzamido groups. Substituting the methylene group of compound 15 with an ethylene group, we obtained compounds 18k-l ( Table 2 ).\n\n2.3.2. Synthetic procedures. Scheme 1 depicts the sequence of reactions that led to the preparation of compounds 1-4 and 16a-j using isatins (19) as the starting material. In general, the substituted 4-quinolinecarboxy-lic acids 20 were prepared by isatins (19) condensation with ketones in ethanol. Compound 20 was converted to the corresponding acyl chlorides (21) by refluxing with SOCl 2 . 27 Then 21 was substituted by using different sulfanilamides, giving the target compounds 1-4 and 16a-j ( Table 1 ). The key intermediate 25 required by synthesizing compound 16j was prepared from compound 23 28 by sulfamation and deprotection.\n\nCompounds 16k-q were synthesized through the route outlined in Scheme 2. 2-Bromo-1-arylethanone (26) was reacted by refluxing with ammonium formate in 98% HCOOH, which afforded 4-aryloxazole (27) . 29 Compound 28 was synthesized using the Usui Y. method 30 by compound 27 reacting with maleic acid at 110\u00b0C for 15 min. Then, the target compounds 16k-q were obtained after steps c-d of Scheme 1 were employed ( Table 1 ).\n\nCompounds 5-6 and 17a-d were synthesized by using the same process as compounds 1-4, except compound 20 was replaced by compound 29. The synthetic route is outlined in Scheme 3. Scheme 4 depicts the sequence of reactions that led to the preparation of compounds 15 and 18a-i using anthranilic acid (30) as the starting material. Compound 31a 31 was synthesized by heating anthranilic acid (30) with HCHO in 36% HCl. Refluxing 31a with saturated HCl in methanol afforded compound 31b. Acylation 31a-b with various substituted benzoyl chlorides in pyridine afforded compounds 15 and 18a-f. Compound 31b reacted with benzyl bromide in refluxing NMP produced compound 18g, which was hydrolyzed using LiOH at 25 and 80\u00b0C to afford monoester 18h and dicarboxylic acid 18i, respectively.\n\nCompounds 18j-l were synthesized through the route outlined in Scheme 5. Refluxing 5-methyl-2-nitrobenzoic acid (32) with saturated HCl in methanol afforded compound 33, which was then brominated by NBS in chloroform to afford compound 34. 32 Compound 34 was coupled with compound 33, giving the key intermediate 35 in the presence of n-BuLi at \u00c078\u00b0C, which was then reduced by Pd-C. Compound 18j was obtained by N-acylation of 37 with 3,5-dimethoxybenzoyl chloride in pyridine. Compound 18k was obtained under the same conditions as compound 18a, and compound 18l was quantitatively obtained by hydrolysis of 18k using LiOH at room temperature.\n\n2.4.1. Binding assay. CypA was expressed and purified according to our previously reported procedure. 8 The binding affinities of the virtual screening candidates to CypA in vitro were determined by employing the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology. The measurement was performed using the dual flow cell Biacore 3000 instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Immobilization of the CypA to the hydrophilic carboxymethylated dextran matrix of the sensor chip CM5 (Biacore) was carried out by the standard primary amine coupling reaction wizard. The CypA to be covalently bound to the matrix was diluted in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0) to a final concentration of 0.035 mg/mL. Equilibration of the baseline was completed by a continuous flow of HBS-EP running buffer (10 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, and 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20, pH 7.4) through the chip for 1-2 h. All the Biacore data were collected at 25\u00b0C with HBS-EP as running buffer at a constant flow rate of 30 lL/min. All the sensorgrams were processed by using automatic correction for non-specific bulk refractive index effects. The equilibrium constants (K D values) evaluating the protein-ligand binding affinities were determined by the steady state affinity fitting analysis of the Biacore data. 2.4.2. Enzymatic activity assay. CypA PPIase activity was measured at 4\u00b0C by using the standard chymotrypsincoupled assay. 33 The assay buffer (50 mM Hepes, 100 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) and CypA (500 nM stock solution) were pre-cooled to 4\u00b0C, to which then was added 15 lL of 3 mg/mL chymotrypsin in 1 mM HCl. The reaction was initiated by adding 12 lL of 3.8 mM peptide substrate (Suc-Ala-Ala-cis-Pro-Phe-pNA) in LiCl/THF solution with rapid inversion. After a delay from the onset of mixing (usually 6 s), the absorbance of p-nitroaniline was followed at 390 nM until the reaction was complete (1 min). The final concentration of LiCl in the assay was 9.6 mM; THF was present at a concentration of 2% (v/v). Absorbance readings were collected every 0.1 s by a U-2010 spectrophotometer. The progress curves were analyzed by non-linear least-squares fit.\n\nThe inhibition assays of compounds were performed in the same manner as mentioned above. A 0.6 lL aliquot of the compounds in DMSO was added to the CypA solution in the assay buffer. After being pre-incubated for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, the assay was started by the addition of chymotrypsin and the substrate. To calculate the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ), the percent of remaining PPIase activity is plotted against the common logarithm of the compound concentration, and the data were fitted using the sigmoidal fitting model by the Origin7.0 software.\n\nFemale ICR strains of mice, 6-8 weeks old and 20 \u00b1 2 g, were purchased from the Experimental Animal House of China Pharmaceutical University (Nanjing, China) and were maintained in plastic cages with free access to pellet food and water (12 h light/dark cycle, 21 \u00b1 2\u00b0C). This study complied with the current ethical regulations on animal research in Nanjing University and the mice used were treated humanely.\n\nThe spleen was aseptically taken from mice, crushed gently, and separated into single cells by squeezing in 5 mL D D-Hanks\u00d5 solution (Gibco-BRL). The cells obtained were passed through eight layers of gauze and centrifuged at 1000 rev/min for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. Pellets were added into 10 mL of sterile 0.17 M Tris-(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane containing 0.75% NH 4 Cl (pH 7.5) followed by centrifugation to remove erythrocytes. After washing twice with RPMI 1640 containing 100 U mL \u00c01 penicillin, 100 U mL \u00c01 streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (RPMI 1640 medium), they were re-suspended in the RPMI 1640 medium and used for cell culture.\n\nSpleen cells were cultured in 96-well flat-bottomed microplates (Falcon) at a density of 5 \u00b7 10 5 cells per well in RPMI 1640 medium (0.2 mL) and stimulated with 5 lg mL \u00c01 Con A for 72 h at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 -air in the presence or absence (control group) of various concentrations of compounds. Then the cell growth was evaluated with modified MTT assay. 34 Briefly, 20 lL of 5 mg mL \u00c01 MTT in RPMI 1640 was added for a further 4 h incubation. After removing the supernatant, 200 lL of DMSO was added to dissolve the formazan crystals. The plate was shaken for 10 min and then read on an ELISA reader (Sunrise Remote/Touch Screen; TECAN, Austria) at 540 nm. All assays were run in triplicate and the effect of compounds on the proliferation of mouse spleen cells induced by Con A was calculated by Eq. 1\n\nInhibitory rate \u00f0%\u00de \u00bc \u00f0control \u00f0OD 540 \u00de \u00c0 compounds \u00f0OD 540 \u00de\u00de=control \u00f0OD 540 \u00de.\n\nData were expressed as means \u00b1 SD (significance of differences between groups). Statistical analysis was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance, followed by Student\u00d5s two-tailed t test for the evaluation of the differ- ence between two groups and Dunnett\u00d5s t test between control group and multiple dose groups. One-way analysis of variance revealed a significant effect at P < 0.05.\n\nTargeting the crystal structure of CypA (PDB entry 1NMK), 14 we searched the SPECS_1 database by using DOCK4.0. 21 The small molecules were ranked according to their scores calculated by using the scoring function of DOCK. The top 5000 candidate molecules were obtained with the best scores by a shape complementarity scoring function in DOCK. 21 These compounds were re-estimated using Cscore. 24 A total of 1301 compounds with Cscore = 4 or 5 (the best score of Cscore is 5) were subsequently docked and ranked using the FlexX 26 program. Finally, 82 compounds were selected according to the score of FlexX for biological assay. Because enzymatic assay is time-consuming, therefore, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements were used for the primary screening, determining the binding affinity of these 82 candidate molecules to CypA. Immobilization of CypA resulted in a resonance signal at about 5370 resonance units (RUs). Among the 82 compounds, the biosensor RUs of 15 compounds were concentration-dependent. The collected data indicated that these 15 compounds can bind to CypA in vitro and the binding affinities to cyclophilin A are in the submicro-or micro-molar range (K D = 53.4-0.58lM). These compounds could be designated as binders (or hits) of CypA, their chemical structures and binding affinities shown in Figure 1 .\n\nStructurally, the 15 hits can be divided into three classes: class I includes eight compounds containing sulfanilamide moiety (compounds 1-8); class II compounds are acylhydrazone derivatives (compounds 9-12); class III is comprised by compounds 13-15, which have no distinct structural character (Fig. 1) . Considering the structural similarity and the binding affinity with CypA, we took compounds 1-6 in class I and compound 15 in class III as leaders for structural optimization. Totally, 40 compounds (1-6, 15, 16a-q, 17a-d, and 18a-l) were designed and synthesized, and their chemical structures are shown in Tables 1 and 2. These compounds were synthesized through the routes outlined in Schemes 1-5, and the details for synthetic procedures and structural characterizations are described in the Experimental section. Tables 1 and 2. Four compounds, i.e., 16b, 16h, 16k, and 18g, can remarkably inhibit the PPIase activity of CyPA (percent inhibition at 10 lM > 50%), indicating that these four compounds are CypA inhibitors. Therefore, we determined their IC 50 values, which are, respectively, 4.88, 2.84, 2.48, and 6.23 lM (Fig. 2 ). In addition, the binding affinities of the 33 analogues were determined by using the SPR technology, the results also listed in Tables 1 and 2. The PPIase activities of the compounds do not consistently correlate with the SPR binding affinities. The reason may be that the protein was immobilized to a sensor chip in the SPR assay, which affects the conformational flexibility of the protein. Accordingly, good binders identified by the SPR assay may not be good inhibitors. To find CypA inhibitors rather than binders, the effects of compounds on the PPIase activity of CypA have to be determined.\n\nTo test the immunosuppressive effects of 16a, 16h, 16k, and 18g, anti-proliferation activities on spleen cells in vitro of the four inhibitors have been evaluated. The result is listed in Table 3 , indicating that compounds 16a, 16h, and 16k show partial influence on the viability of the na\u00efve spleen cells. It is remarkable that the effective concentration of compound 16h is $10 lM in inhibition of the proliferation of mouse spleen cells induced by Con A, which is slightly lower than that of CsA. This indicates that compound 16h is a good lead for designing more potent immunosuppressive agents. a Each value indicates the mean \u00b1 SD of three experiments using three mice with triplicate sets in each assay. b One-way analysis of variance revealed a significant effect at P < 0.05.\n\nTo gain structural information for further structural optimization, the 3D binding models of the designed compounds to CypA were generated based on the docking simulation, Figure 3 shows the interaction models of four potent inhibitors (16a, 16h, 16k, and 18g) to CypA. From Figure 3 , one can see that there are two binding sites in the surface binding groove of CypA: site A is a small binding pocket formed by Lys82, Met100, Ala101, Asn102, Ala103, Thr107, Asn108, Gly109, Ser110, Gln111, and Phe112; near site A, there is a larger pocket, which is called site B, formed by Phe60, Met61, Gln63, Ala101, Asn102, Ala103, Phe113, Leu122, and His126; there is a \u00d4saddle\u00d5 between the two sites. The binding models indicate that class I compounds (Table 1 ) interact with CypA in a similar way: the common sulfanilamide moiety occupies the polar binding site (site B), forming three to four hydrogen-bonds (H-bonds) with residues Gln63, Gly75, Asn102, Thr107, Ser110, and Gln111 (Fig. 4) ; the 2-substituents of quinoline rings (1-4 and 16a-j) and pyridine rings (16k-q) or aryl rings (5, 6 and 17a-d) fill in the hydrophobic pocket (site A); and the quinoline moiety (1-4 and 16a-j), the pyridine moiety (16k-q) or alkyl groups (5, 6 and 17a-d) act as linkers interacting with the saddle part between sites A and B. The interacting models for class III compounds to CypA are mostly similar to those for class I compounds, except that compounds 15, 18a, 18d-f, and 18j-l extend from site B due to their longer linkers and/or substituents.\n\nIn summary, we have discovered four potent CypA inhibitors (16a, 16h, 16k, and 18g) by using a structure-based virtual screening approach in conjunction with chemical synthesis and bioassay. One of them (compound 16h) is active with very close potency to CsA in inhibiting the proliferation of spleen cells, demonstrating that this compound may be a good lead for discovering new immunosuppressive agents. Discovering small molecule CypA inhibitors is an urgent need, so the new chemical structures produced in this study are of significance.\n\nThe reagents (chemicals) were purchased from Lancaster, Acros, and Shanghai Chemical Reagent Company, Yields were not optimized. Melting points were measured in capillary tube with a SGW X-4 melting point apparatus without correction. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were given on a Brucker AMX-400 NMR (IS as TMS). Chemical shifts were reported in parts per million (ppm, d) downfield from tetramethylsilane. Proton coupling patterns were described as singlet (s), doublet (d), triplet (t), quartet (q), multiplet (m), and broad (br). Low-and high-resolution mass spectra (LRMS and HRMS) were given with electric, electrospray, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (EI, ESI, and MALDI) produced by Finnigan MAT-95, LCQ-DECA spectrometer, and IonSpec 4.7 T.\n\nA mixture of 4-acetylamino-benzenesulfonyl chloride 22 (2.34 g, 10 mmol) and compound 15 28 (1.45 g, 10 mmol) in pyridine (20 mL) A mixture of compound 24 (1 g, 3 mmol) and NaOH (1.5 g, 37.5 mmol) in H 2 O (15 mL) was refluxed for 2 h to generate a yellow solution, which was acidified to pH 5.5 at 70-80\u00b0C. After cooling to room temperature, the precipitate was collected, washed with H 2 O, and dried, to afford compound 25 (0.8 g, 91.2%) as a yellow solid: mp 258-260\u00b0C; EI-MS m/z 300 (M + ), 236 (100%).\n\nGeneral procedures for preparations of 20 27 are described as those for 2-(3-fluorophenyl)-quiniline-4-carboxylic acid (20a)\n\nAs illustrated in Scheme 1, isatin 19 (34.0 mmol), 3-fluoroacetophenone (40.8 mmol), and 85% KOH pellets (102 mmol) were dissolved in EtOH (40 mL), and the reaction mixture was stirred at 80\u00b0C for 24 h. The mixture was condensed, diluted with water, and acidified with concd HCl, and the precipitate was collected, Figure 4 .

It is drawn using the LIGPLOT program. 35 A distance between donor and acceptor of less than 3.4 \u00c5 is considered as a hydrogen-bond, and a 4.1 \u00c5 distance between two hydrophobic atoms is considered a hydrophobic interaction. A mixture of 4-phenyloxazole 27m (1 g, 6.9 mmol) and maleic acid (0.83 g, 7.1 mmol) was heated at 110\u00b0C until melting for 2 h. The solid obtained after cooling was triturated with Et 2 O, collected by suction filtration. The filter cake was recrystallized with 95% EtOH to yield 28m (3,4-dimethyl-isoxazol-5-yl) benzene sulfonamide (1) . A suspension of 3-bromophenyl-quinoline-4-carboxylic acid (0.33 g, 1 mmol) in redistilled SOCl 2 (6 mL) was refluxed gently for 3 h. A clear solution resulted. The SOCl 2 was then evaporated under reduced pressure.
