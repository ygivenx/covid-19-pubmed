{"title": "Concept learning via granular computing: A cognitive viewpoint", "body": "Cognitive computing is the development of computer systems modeled on the human brain [38] . It embodies major natural intelligence behaviors of the brain including perception, attention, thinking, etc. As an emerging paradigm of intelligent computing methodologies, cognitive computing has the characteristic of integrating past experiences into itself [22] . Nowadays, this theory has become an interdisciplinary research and application field and absorbed methods from psychology, information theory, mathematics and so on [37, 39] .\n\nConcepts are the most fundamental units of cognition in philosophy and they carry certain meanings in almost all cognitive processes such as inference, learning and reasoning [37, 50] . In this sense, a concept is in fact a cognitive unit to identify and/or model a real-world concrete entity and a perceived-world abstract subject. As is well known, how to efficiently learn concepts from various aspects in the real world is the main concern within the domain of conceptual knowledge presentation and processing. Up to now, for meeting the requirements of data analysis and knowledge manipulation, all kinds of concepts which carry certain meanings have been proposed such as abstract concepts [37] , Wille's concepts [42] , object-oriented concepts [48, 49] and property-oriented concepts [9] . http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2014.12.010 0020-0255/\u00d3 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n\nIn philosophy, a concept can generally be identified by its extension part (often called extent) and intension part (often called intent) which can be determined with each other [9, 37, 42, 48, 49] . The extent of a concept is the set of all objects or instances that the concept denotes, and the intent of a concept is the set of attributes or properties that a concept connotes [37, 42] . In order to reflect the relationship of specialization and generalization among concepts, a structure of concepts can further be built by defining a partial order on the concepts under consideration. By this means, the obtained concept structure often forms a complete lattice no matter what kinds of meanings we give to the concepts, and hence some scholars from the community of formal concept analysis [42] called it certain concept lattice instead. For example, different concept structures have been proposed by specifying certain meanings of the concepts in the real world such as Wille's concept lattice [42] , object-oriented concept lattice [48, 49] , property-oriented concept lattice [9] , AFS-concept lattice [40] , power concept lattice [11] and others [6, 15, 16, 20, 21] . Note that these certain concept structures or lattices establish rigorous mathematical models and provide formal semantics for data analysis in practice. In other words, meanings of real-world concrete entities can be represented and semantics of abstract subjects can be embodied by these certain concept structures. All in all, learning concepts (sometimes including their corresponding structure) has been investigated from various aspects. However, the current paper focuses on this issue from a novel aspect (i.e., a cognitive viewpoint).\n\nNote that, generally speaking, learning a certain concept structure from a given dataset is computationally expensive when its size is large. The reason is that the number of concepts in the structure will increase exponentially in the worst case. Considering that granular computing gives rise to processing that is less time demanding than the one required when dealing with detailed numeric processing [2] [3] [4] . Information granule, the basic notion in the theory of granular computing which can broadly be viewed as a collection of information granules and the area of intelligent computing revolving around them [26] , was introduced into Wille's concept lattice as an attempt to decrease computation time [43] . In a general sense, by information granule, one regards a collection of elements drawn together by their closeness (resemblance, proximity, functionality, etc.) articulated in terms of some useful spatial, temporal, or functional relationships [52, 53] . In fact, information granules are intuitively appealing constructs, which play a pivotal role in human cognitive and decision-making activities [24] . It is also worth stressing that information granules permeate almost all human endeavors [2] [3] [4] [5] 24, 25, 27, 53, 54] . For example, information granules have been studied in rough set theory [17, 23, 29, 30, 35, 44, 46, 47] extensively which is considered as one of the approaches of granular computing, and applied in formal concept analysis [10] , evidence analysis [33] , etc. Recently, studies on combination of granular computing with formal concept analysis have been made by several researchers [7, 12, 19, 31, 41, 43, 45, 56] . And what is particularly worth mentioning is that information granules in formal concept analysis mean granular concepts [43] which are the basic concepts used to deduce others. As a matter of fact, in order to improve efficiency sharply, learning concept structure indeed needs the idea of granular computing no matter how we specify the certain meanings of the concepts in the real world, no exception to cognitive concepts to be discussed in the current paper.\n\nNote that the aforementioned concepts were learned using constructive methods, which means that the concepts were formed by defining certain concept-forming operators [9, 11, 16, 40, 42, 48, 49] . In the meanwhile, axiomatic methods are also needed in terms of learning methodologies in which concepts are learned by establishing axiomatic systems (i.e., sets of axioms). To the best of our knowledge, axiomatic systems of concept learning were often called concept systems instead. In recent years, there have been several concept systems proposed for certain concept learning such as cognitive system [45] , concept granular computing system [31] , generalized concept system [19] and generalized dual concept system [18] . At the same time, it should be pointed out that these concept systems can also be used to learn the certain concepts which were obtained by using the constructive methods in [9, 11, 16, 40, 42, 48, 49] . Compared with constructive methods, axiomatic methods try to look beyond appearance for the essence of concept learning. However, the existing concept systems cannot integrate past experiences into itself. In other words, they are not able to deal with e.g., dynamic data and thereby are lack of flexibility for data analysis in practice. Besides, no explanation was provided to the background of the axioms of the existing concept systems, which means that they are too abstract to be understood. But, as far as we know, it is possible to solve these problems to some extent by means of concept learning based on cognitive computing because this kind of computing approach has the characteristic of integrating past experiences into itself and the background of simulating intelligence behaviors of the brain including perception, attention and learning.\n\nTo sum up, concept learning deserves to be studied based on granular computing from the perspective of cognitive computing, which may be beneficial to understanding and describing human cognitive processes in a conceptual knowledge way. Our current study mainly focuses on this issue. More precisely, the problems to be discussed are analysis of cognitive mechanism of forming concepts, integration of granular computing into cognitive concept structure, establishment of cognitive computing system, and implementation of cognitive processes. Note that the proposed cognitive computing system not only can integrate past experiences into itself by recursive thinking, but also is easy to be understood because cognitive mechanism of forming concepts is analyzed in advance based on the principles from philosophy and cognitive psychology.\n\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, cognitive mechanism of forming concepts is analyzed based on the principles from philosophy and cognitive psychology, including how to define concept-forming cognitive operators, construct cognitive concepts and induce their hierarchical structure. In Section 3, granular computing is integrated into the induced cognitive concept structure. In Section 4, we put forward a cognitive computing system in which the notions of a cognitive computing state, an object-oriented cognitive computing state and an attribute-oriented cognitive computing state are proposed. In Section 5, we investigate the cognitive processes whose aims are to deal with the problem of learning one exact or two approximate cognitive concepts from a given object set, attribute set or pair of object and attribute sets. In Section 6, we discuss the main differences and relations between the proposed concept learning approach and the existing ones, and give explanations on some obtained results in our study. The paper is then concluded with a brief summary and an outlook for further research.\n\nIn this section, we analyze cognitive mechanism of forming concepts based on the principles from philosophy and cognitive psychology.\n\nLet U be an object set and A be an attribute set. We denote the power sets of U and A by 2 U and 2 A , respectively. Hereinafter, suppose L : 2 U ! 2 A and H : 2 A ! 2 U are two set-valued mappings which are rewritten as L and H for short when there is no confusion. If the mappings L and H are used to derive concepts from a given object-attribute relation in the sense of cognition, then what do they need to obey? In what follows, we address this problem based on the principles from philosophy and cognitive psychology.\n\nFrom the point of view of philosophy, a concept has two constituent parts: extent X and intent B, where X is a set of objects and B is a set of attributes. In general, the more objects a concept denotes, the less attributes it connotes, and vice versa. By this principle, given object sets X 1 ; X 2 and attribute sets B 1 , B 2 , we have\n\nwhere L\u00f0X 1 \u00de and L\u00f0X 2 \u00de denote the corresponding intents of X 1 and X 2 , respectively; H\u00f0B 1 \u00de and H\u00f0B 2 \u00de denote the corresponding extents of B 1 and B 2 , respectively. From the perspective of cognitive psychology, the principle for perception can be used to restrain the mapping L, while that for attention can be used to restrain the mapping H. The details are described below.\n\nAccording to Gestalt psychology [13, 14] , the perception of the whole is more than the integration of those of its parts. By this principle, we obtain\n\nHere, the intersection of attribute sets on the right side represents ''the integration of perceptions of parts''.\n\nRemark 1. By considering that the value on the left of Eq. (3) will equal the one on the right when X 1 \u00bc X 2 , the proper inclusion ''''' which should have been used between the left and right sides so as to strictly obey the principle for perception, has to be weakened to ''''. Moreover, in terms of the principle for attention in cognitive psychology, the selection model of Deutsch and Deutsch [8] says that all information (attended and unattended) should be analyzed for meaning in order to select some inputs for full awareness. Whether or not the information is selected is dependent on how relevant it is at the time. By this principle, we get\n\nThat is, the information at least relevant to all attributes in B will be selected. It is easy to verify that Eq. (2) can be implied by Eq. (4). Thus, combining the principles from philosophy with those from cognitive psychology for perception and attention, we claim that Eqs. (1), (3) and (4) should be satisfied by the set-valued mappings L and H when they are used to learn concepts from a given object-attribute relation. Definition 1. Let L and H be two set-valued mappings. If for any X 1 ; X 2 # U and B # A, the following properties hold:\n\nthen L and H are called concept-forming cognitive operators (or simply cognitive operators). The formula in Eq. (5) can be explained as ''the perception of the whole is equal to the integration of those of its parts'', which is not surprising for the cognitive operator L. The reason is that on one hand the principle ''the perception of the whole is more than the integration of those of its parts'' is weakened to ''the perception of the whole is more than or equal to the integration of those of its parts'' in Eq. (3) , and on the other hand the principle for a concept in philosophy has also been embodied into the cognitive operator L. Similarly, the formula in Eq. (6) can be explained as ''the information at least relevant to all attributes under consideration is equal to the integration of those at least relevant to its parts''. Proposition 2. Let L and H be cognitive operators. Then for any X # U and B # A, we have X # HL\u00f0X\u00de; \u00f07\u00de\n\nwhere HL\u00f0\u00de and LH\u00f0\u00de represent the compositions H\u00f0L\u00f0\u00de\u00de and L\u00f0H\u00f0\u00de\u00de, respectively.\n\nProof. It is immediate from Definition 1. h\n\nThe formula in Eq. (7) can be explained as ''other objects (if any) analogous to X can be recognized by HL-cognition of X'', and the formula in Eq. (8) can be explained as ''other attributes (if any) analogous to B can be recognized by LH-cognition of B''.\n\nHere, we are extremely interested in the pair \u00f0X; B\u00de satisfying X \u00bc H\u00f0B\u00de and B \u00bc L\u00f0X\u00de since in this case both X and B reach the balance with respect to HL and LH-cognitions, respectively. In other words, X \u00bc HL\u00f0X\u00de and B \u00bc LH\u00f0B\u00de can be satisfied simultaneously. In fact, such pairs \u00f0X; B\u00de satisfying X \u00bc H\u00f0B\u00de and B \u00bc L\u00f0X\u00de are a kind of useful conceptual knowledge in the sense of cognition.\n\nDefinition 2. Let L and H be cognitive operators. For X # U and B # A, if L\u00f0X\u00de \u00bc B and H\u00f0B\u00de \u00bc X, we say that the pair \u00f0X; B\u00de is a concept under the cognitive operators L and H (or simply a cognitive concept). In this case, X and B are referred to as the extent and intent of the cognitive concept \u00f0X; B\u00de, respectively. Example 2. Let L and H be the cognitive operators shown in Example 1. Then by Definition 2, it is easy to verify that \u00f0f1; 2; 3; 4g; ;\u00de, \u00f0f1; 2g; fb; dg\u00de; \u00f0f1; 4g; fag\u00de; \u00f0f3; 4g; fcg\u00de, \u00f0f1g; fa; b; dg\u00de; \u00f0f4g; fa; cg\u00de and \u00f0;; fa; b; c; dg\u00de are cognitive concepts which can be viewed to some extent as the learning results after perception and attention.\n\nMoreover, in the real world, it is necessary to make the correlation analysis between cognitive concepts. This motivates us to establish generalization and specialization relationships between the cognitive concepts. More precisely, for two cognitive concepts \u00f0X 1 ; B 1 \u00de and \u00f0X 2 ; B 2 \u00de under L and H, if X 1 # X 2 , then \u00f0X 1 ; B 1 \u00de is called a subconcept of \u00f0X 2 ; B 2 \u00de, or equivalently, \u00f0X 2 ; B 2 \u00de is called a superconcept of \u00f0X 1 ; B 1 \u00de, which is denoted by \u00f0X 1 ; B 1 \u00de \" \u00f0X 2 ; B 2 \u00de. The set of all cognitive concepts together with the partial order relation \" forms a complete lattice. We call it a cognitive concept structure or a cognitive concept lattice which is denoted by B\u00f0U; A; L; H\u00de. The infimum ( V ) and supremum ( W ) of a set of cognitive concepts f\u00f0X t ; B t \u00c3 \u00c3\u00dej t 2 Tg (T is an index set) are respectively defined as:\n\n3. Integrating granular computing into cognitive concept lattice\n\nAccording to the discussion in Section 2, given cognitive operators L and H, we can find in theory all cognitive concepts. However, in practice, it may be hard to implement such an action since the exhaustion of all elements of L and H is difficult when the cardinalities of U and A are large, let alone finding all cognitive concepts. For instance, in Example 1, the total number of X i # L\u00f0X i \u00de (X i # U) in L and B j # H\u00f0B j \u00de (B j # A) in H is 2 jUj \u00fe 2 jAj , which is exponential with respect to the cardinalities jUj and jAj. However, fortunately, according to Eqs. (5) and (6), every L\u00f0X i \u00de can be represented as the intersection of L\u00f0x\u00de (x 2 X i ) and every H\u00f0B j \u00de can be represented as the intersection of H\u00f0a\u00de (a 2 B j ), which means that it is sufficient to list fxg # L\u00f0x\u00de (x 2 U) in the mapping L and fag # H\u00f0a\u00de (a 2 A) in the mapping H. In other words, fxg # L\u00f0x\u00de (x 2 U) are basic but sufficient enough for inducing L, and fag # H\u00f0a\u00de (a 2 A) are basic but sufficient enough for inducing H. Therefore, fxg # L\u00f0x\u00de (x 2 U) and fag # H\u00f0a\u00de (a 2 A) can respectively be viewed as the information granules of L and H in terms of knowledge representation. Moreover, by considering that information granules are the basic notion in the theory of granular computing, it is natural for us to integrate granular computing into cognitive concept lattice for decreasing the computation time. Besides, such an integration is also in accordance with characteristics of human thinking in which complex information is often divided into pieces, classes and groups [28] .\n\nIn what follows, we put forward the notion of information granules of cognitive operators and that of a granular concept.\n\nDefinition 3. Let L and H be cognitive operators. Then L G \u00bc ffxg # L\u00f0x\u00dej x 2 Ug and H G \u00bc ffag # H\u00f0a\u00dej a 2 Ag are called information granules of L and H, respectively. According to Eqs. (5) and (6), the information granules L G and H G can respectively be used to form any X # L\u00f0X\u00de and B # H\u00f0B\u00de as follows:\n\nIt should be pointed out that X # L\u00f0X\u00de and B # H\u00f0B\u00de may not be information granules when X and B are not singleton sets. Take Example 1 for instance, L\u00f0X\u00de \u00bc ; when X \u00bc f2; 4g, and H\u00f0B\u00de \u00bc ;\n\nConsidering that the exhaustion of all elements of L and H is quite hard in practice when the cardinalities of U and A are large, we store and remember the information of L and H in their granular forms, i.e., L G and H G .\n\nMoreover, in preparation for presenting the notion of a granular concept, we need the following proposition. It is easy to observe that granular concepts are basic but sufficient enough to induce others, and we can confirm this by the following proposition. \n\nProof. It follows directly from Eqs. (5), (6) and (9) . h\n\nConsidering that the exhaustion of all cognitive concepts under L and H is quite hard in practice, we store and remember the conceptual knowledge B\u00f0U; A; L; H\u00de in the form of its granular concepts \u00f0HL\u00f0x\u00de; L\u00f0x\u00de\u00de (x 2 U) and \u00f0H\u00f0a\u00de; LH\u00f0a\u00de\u00de (a 2 A) which are able to induce B\u00f0U; A; L; H\u00de.\n\nNote that in fact either \u00f0HL\u00f0x\u00de; L\u00f0x\u00de\u00de (x 2 U) or \u00f0H\u00f0a\u00de; LH\u00f0a\u00de\u00de (a 2 A) is enough to induce all cognitive concepts based on Eq. (10). However, we still need both of them since in practice it may start with an object set, an attribute set or a pair of object and attribute sets for concept learning or set approximation (see Section 5 for details).\n\nTo facilitate subsequent discussion, we denote\n\nThat is, G LH is the set of all granular concepts under the cognitive operators L and H.\n\nExample 3. Let L and H be the cognitive operators shown in Example 1. By Definition 3, we have that\n\n2gg are the information granules of L and H, respectively. With these information granules, we can obtain \n\nIn the previous section, we have discussed how to derive granular concepts from cognitive operators L and H. In the real world, the information on the object set U and attribute set A will be updated as time goes by, which means that the obtained granular concepts need to be updated accordingly. For instance, in Example 1, four symptoms (Fever, Cough, Headache, Difficulty breathing) related to SARS have been found from the current four patients. As time goes by, there will appear more patients from whom additional symptoms (e.g., Diarrhea, Muscle aches, Nausea and vomiting) will be observed (see Example 4 for details). So, it is necessary to update the granular concepts obtained in Example 3.\n\nIn what follows, we put forward a cognitive computing system which can be viewed as the initial environment to learn composite concepts by updating the current granular concepts with the newly input information.\n\nFor convenience, hereinafter n object sets U 1 ; U 2 ; . . . ; U n with U 1 # U 2 # \u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1 # U n are denoted by fU t g \" , and similarly n attribute sets\n\nare four pairs of cognitive operators whose information granules:\n\nwhere L G DU i\u00c01 \u00f0x\u00de and H G DU i\u00c01 \u00f0a\u00de are set to be empty when DU i\u00c01 \u00bc ;, and L G DA i\u00c01 \u00f0x\u00de and H G DA i\u00c01 \u00f0a\u00de are set to be empty when DA i\u00c01 \u00bc ;. Then we say that L i and H i are extended cognitive operators of L i\u00c01 and H i\u00c01 with the newly input information\n\nAs for the background of extended cognitive operators, L i\u00c01 ; H i\u00c01 can be considered as last state of knowledge expressing, and L i ; H i can be considered as the current state of knowledge expressing which is the result of updating the last state of knowledge expressing with the newly input information L DU i\u00c01 , H DU i\u00c01 and L DA i\u00c01 , H DA i\u00c01 . Under this background, from the last state to the current state, granular concepts need to be updated once. \n\nis called a cognitive computing system. As for the background of cognitive computing system, every cognitive computing state can be viewed as the result of updating the information under consideration once, and a collection of cognitive computing states can be viewed as the result of updating a series of information successively.\n\nThen it is important to compute the final granular concepts G LnHn of a cognitive computing system S \u00bc S n i\u00bc2 fS L i H i g based on the initial granular concepts G L 1 H 1 and a series of newly input information ''\n\nNote that this problem is called transformation between information granules in the theory of granular computing. Moreover, considering that recursive approach can be applied here, it is sufficient to solve the subproblem of determining\n\nIn other words, we only need to discuss cognitive computing state\n\nTo achieve this task, we continue to propose the notions of an object-oriented cognitive computing state and an attribute-oriented cognitive computing state.\n\nDefinition 7. Let U i\u00c01 ; U i be object sets of fU t g \" ; A i\u00c01 be an attribute set,\n\nbe three pairs of cognitive operators. If L 0 and H 0 are the extended cognitive operators of L i\u00c01 and H i\u00c01 with the newly input information L DU i\u00c01 and H DU i\u00c01 (i.e., only object information being updated), then\n\n\u00de is called an objectoriented cognitive computing state.\n\n\u00de be an object-oriented cognitive computing state. Then the following statements hold:\n\notherwise,\n\n(ii) For any a 2 A i\u00c01 , we have\n\nProof. (i) If x 2 U i\u00c01 , by Definition 5, we have L 0 \u00f0x\u00de \u00bc L i\u00c01 \u00f0x\u00de due to L DA i\u00c01 \u00f0x\u00de \u00bc ;. Based on Eqs. (6) and (13), we conclude\n\nMoreover, using recursive approach, we obtain (5) and (12), we conclude\n\nAs a result, we obtain \u00f0H 0 \u00f0a\u00de;\n\nMoreover, we put forward the notion of an attribute-oriented cognitive computing state. \n\n\u00de is called an attribute-oriented cognitive computing state.\n\n\u00de be an attribute-oriented cognitive computing state. Then the following statements hold:\n\notherwise,\n\n(ii) For any x 2 U i , we have\n\nProof. We can prove it in a manner similar to Proposition 5. h Combining Definitions 7 and 8 with Propositions 5 and 6, we know that a cognitive computing state\n\nSuch a decomposition is beneficial to the computation of granular concepts G L i H i . More precisely, (1) we firstly decompose S L i H i into OS L 0 H 0 and AS L i H i ; (2) we further use Proposition 5 to calculate the granular concepts G L 0 H 0 ; (3) we finally employ Proposition 6 to compute G L i H i . The detailed results are shown in the following proposition.\n\n\u00de be a cognitive computing state. Then the following statements hold:\n\notherwise,\n\n(2) For any a 2 A i , if a 2 A i\u00c01 , then\n\notherwise,\n\nProposition 7 gives a simple transformation way from the information granules G L i\u00c01 H i\u00c01 to G L i H i with the newly input information L DU i\u00c01 ; H DU i\u00c01 and L DA i\u00c01 ; H DA i\u00c01 .\n\nBased on the above discussion, we are now ready to propose a procedure (called Algorithm 1 to compute the granular concepts G LnHn of a cognitive computing system S \u00bc\n\nresents a cognitive computing state.\n\nAlgorithm 1. Computing the granular concepts of a cognitive computing system\n\nEnsure The granular concepts G LnHn of S. 1: Initialize G L1H1 \u00bc f\u00f0H 1 L 1 \u00f0x\u00de; L 1 \u00f0x\u00de\u00dej x 2 U 1 g [ f\u00f0H 1 \u00f0a\u00de; L 1 H 1 \u00f0a\u00de\u00dej a 2 A 1 g and i \u00bc 2; 2: While i 6 n 3: Denote the object-oriented cognitive computing state \n\nAccording to Propositions 5 and 6, the computations in Steps 3-13 are to find the granular concepts of the object-oriented cognitive computing state OS L 0 H 0 , and those in Steps 14-24 are to find the granular concepts of the attribute-oriented cognitive computing state AS L i H i . By Proposition 7, we know that G L i H i obtained in Step 25 is the granular concepts of the cognitive computing state S L i H i . Consequently, G LnHn output by Algorithm 1 is the granular concepts of the input cognitive\n\nIn fact, from the point of view of granular computing, Algorithm 1 can be viewed as a transformation way from the information granules G L 1 H 1 to G LnHn by means of recursive approach. Now, we analyze the time complexity of Algorithm 1. Suppose S \u00bc S n i\u00bc2 fS L i H i g is the input cognitive computing system.\n\nThen, based on the discussion in Section 2, running Step 1 takes O\u00f0\u00f0jU 1 j \u00fe jA 1 j\u00dej U 1 jjA 1 j\u00de. Furthermore, we know that the time complexity of Steps 3-13 is O\u00f0\u00f0jU i j \u00fe jA i j\u00dej U i jjA i j\u00de and so is that of Steps 14-24. Thus, running Steps 2-27 takes O\u00f0n\u00f0jU n j \u00fe jA n j\u00dej U n jjA n j\u00de, where n is the number of cognitive computing states. To sum up, the time complexity of Algorithm 1 is O\u00f0n\u00f0jU n j \u00fe jA n j\u00dej U n jjA n j\u00de which is polynomial.\n\nExample 4. In Example 1, four symptoms (Fever, Cough, Headache, Difficulty breathing) related to SARS have been found from the four patients. As time goes by, there will appear more patients (e.g., patients 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9) from whom additional symptoms (e.g., Diarrhea, Muscle aches, Nausea and vomiting) will be observed. We suppose the information updating on the patients and symptoms is shown in Table 1 by U 1 (i.e., U 1 \u00bc f1; 2; 3; 4g), that of original symptoms by A 1 (i.e., A 1 \u00bc fa; b; c; dg), and the cognitive operators between 2 U 1 and 2 A 1 by L 1 and H 1 (see Example 1 for details). Then the information granules of L 1 and H 1 and their granular concepts G L 1 H 1 can be found in Example 3.\n\nBesides, we denote the new patients by 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and the new symptoms by e; f and g, respectively. Let U 2 \u00bc f1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9g; A 2 \u00bc fa; b; c; d; e; f ; gg, DU 1 \u00bc U 2 \u00c0 U 1 \u00bc f5; 6; 7; 8; 9g; DA 1 \u00bc A 2 \u00c0 A 1 \u00bc fe; f ; gg. Similar to Example 1, by intuitive perception and attention, we can obtain the cognitive operators L DU 1 : \n\nWe denote by L 2 and H 2 the extended cognitive operators of L 1 and H 1 with the newly input information L DU 1 , H DU 1 and L DA 1 , H DA 1 (see Eqs. (12) and (13) for construction of L 2 and H 2 ). Then S L 2 H 2 \u00bc \u00f0G L 1 H 1 ; L DU 1 ; H DU 1 ; L DA 1 ; H DA 1 \u00de is a cognitive computing state which also forms a cognitive computing system S with n \u00bc 2.\n\nUsing Algorithm 1, we obtain the granular concepts G L 2 H 2 of the cognitive computing system S as follows: \n\nIn the real world, it is important to learn cognitive concept(s) based on the current ones when additional information is given to object set, attribute set or both of them. Solving this problem is often called cognitive process [38, 45] . For instance, continued with Example 4, we suppose patients 3, 4 and 5 are children suffering from SARS. Then which symptoms characterize these children exactly in terms of suffering from SARS? Unfortunately, the current granular concepts G L 2 H 2 listed at the end of Example 4 cannot answer this question since no granular concept has the extent X 1 \u00bc f3; 4; 5g. In order to deal with this issue, we need to learn additional cognitive concept(s) according to the given object set X 1 \u00bc f3; 4; 5g based on the obtained granular concepts G L 2 H 2 . Similarly, it is also necessary to learn additional cognitive concept(s) when new information is given to an attribute set or a pair of object and attribute sets. In this section, using set approximations, we discuss cognitive processes to learn one exact or two approximate cognitive concepts from a given object set, attribute set or pair of object and attribute sets based on the granular concepts G LnHn of a cognitive computing system. Before embarking on this issue, we introduce some basic notions related to rough set theory (e.g., lower and upper approximations, rough set, etc) in order to explicitly show where the idea of our set approximations comes from.\n\nFormally, an information system can be considered as a pair I \u00bc hU; ATi [23] , where.\n\nU is a non-empty finite set of objects, called the universe.\n\nAT is a non-empty finite set of attributes such that for any a 2 AT; V a is the domain of attribute a.\n\nFor any x 2 U, we denote by a\u00f0x\u00de the value of x under the attribute a 2 AT. Given A # AT, an indiscernibility relation IND\u00f0A\u00de can be defined as:\n\nIND\u00f0A\u00de \u00bc f\u00f0x; y\u00de 2 U \u00c2 Uja\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc a\u00f0y\u00de forall a 2 Ag:\n\nIt is easy to verify that the relation IND\u00f0A\u00de is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. In other words, IND\u00f0A\u00de forms an equivalence relation which can partition U into equivalence classes \u00bdx A \u00bc fy 2 Uj\u00f0x; y\u00de 2 IND\u00f0A\u00deg. We denote this partition of U by U=IND\u00f0A\u00de. That is, U=IND\u00f0A\u00de \u00bc f\u00bdx A jx 2 Ug. Then one can derive lower and upper approximations of an arbitrary subset X of U which are respectively defined as:\n\nIn rough set theory [23] , the pair \u00bdA\u00f0X\u00de; A\u00f0X\u00de is referred to as the rough set of X with respect to the attribute set A.\n\nNote that the idea of lower and upper approximations in rough set theory was further extended by Saquer and Deogun [32] , Yao and Chen [51] , and Zhang and Qiu [55] to Wille's concept lattice, and by Shao et al. [34] to fuzzy concept lattice.\n\nIn this subsection, we investigate the problem of learning one exact or two approximate cognitive concepts from a given object set by means of set approximations. Firstly, we put forward an approach to approximate an object set.\n\nLet G LnHn be the granular concepts of a cognitive computing system S \u00bc S n i\u00bc2 fS L i H i g and B\u00f0U n ; A n ; L n ; H n \u00de be the corresponding cognitive concept lattice. Then, based on the discussion in Section 3, we know that G LnHn is the set of basic information granules of B\u00f0U n ; A n ; L n ; H n \u00de. Motivated by the existing set approximation ideas [23, 32, 34, 51, 55] , we respectively define the lower and upper approximations of an object set X 0 in the cognitive concept lattice B\u00f0U n ; A n ; L n ; H n \u00de as follows: \n\nwhere extent\u00f0\u00de denotes the extent of a cognitive concept. That is, the lower approximation Apr\u00f0X 0 \u00de is the extent of the supremum of the cognitive concepts which are specializations of \u00f0H n L n \u00f0X 0 \u00de; L n \u00f0X 0 \u00de\u00de, and the upper approximation Apr\u00f0X 0 \u00de is the extent of the infimum of the cognitive concepts which are generalizations of \u00f0H n L n \u00f0X 0 \u00de; L n \u00f0X 0 \u00de\u00de.\n\nAccording to Eqs. (9) and (24), the lower and upper approximations of X 0 can also be represented as: \n\nThus, we consider \u00f0Apr\u00f0X 0 \u00de; L n \u00f0Apr\u00f0X 0 \u00de\u00de\u00de and \u00f0Apr\u00f0X 0 \u00de; L n \u00f0Apr\u00f0X 0 \u00de\u00de\u00de as the result of learning cognitive concepts from the given object set X 0 by means of set approximations. Moreover, we define the (concept) learning accuracy as\n\nwhich is used to measure the accuracy of learning cognitive concepts from X 0 . Obviously, the learning accuracy a\u00f0X 0 \u00de equals 1 if and only if Apr\u00f0X 0 \u00de \u00bc Apr\u00f0X 0 \u00de. Note that by Algorithm 1, we only obtain the granular concepts G Ln Hn of a cognitive computing system S \u00bc S n i\u00bc2 fS L i H i g.\n\nAlthough, according to Eq. (10), we are able to induce all cognitive concepts B\u00f0U n ; A n ; L n ; H n \u00de using G LnHn and then determine the lower and upper approximations of X 0 . However, in practice, it is generally hard to implement such an action since the nodes of B\u00f0U n ; A n ; L n ; H n \u00de increase exponentially in the worst case. To solve this problem, we need the following proposition. For convenience, we denote G \u00c3 LnHn \u00bc G LnHn [ f\u00f0U n ; ;\u00deg; if \u00f0U n ; ;\u00de 2 B\u00f0U n ; A n ; L n ; H n \u00de;\n\n; A n \u00deg; if \u00f0;; A n \u00de 2 B\u00f0U n ; A n ; L n ; H n \u00de; G LnHn ; otherwise:\n\n& Proposition 8. Let B\u00f0U n ; A n ; L n ; H n \u00de be the cognitive concept lattice of the cognitive operators L n and H n , and G LnHn be the corresponding granular concepts. Then for any X 0 # U, we have\n\nProof. We denote by G #T LnHn the complement of G # LnHn with respect to B\u00f0U n ; A n ; L n ; H n \u00de and by G \u00c3T LnHn the complement of G \u00c3 LnHn with respect to B\u00f0U n ; A n ; L n ; H n \u00de. That is, G #T LnHn \u00bc B\u00f0U n ; A n ; L n ; H n \u00de \u00c0 G # LnHn and G \u00c3T LnHn \u00bc B\u00f0U n ; A n ; L n ; H n \u00de \u00c0 G \u00c3 LnHn . Then by Eq. As a result, Eq. (28) is at hand. h Proposition 8 says that the granular concepts G LnHn (exactly G \u00c3 Ln Hn and G # LnHn ), which can easily be computed by Algorithm 1 from a cognitive computing system, are able to approximate an object set X 0 with the same result as B\u00f0U n ; A n ; L n ; H n \u00de. More precisely,\n\nThis allows us to learn cognitive concept(s) from an object set X 0 using the granular concepts G LnHn instead of the cognitive concept lattice B\u00f0U n ; A n ; L n ; H n \u00de.\n\nProposition 9. Let \u00f0Apr\u00f0X 0 \u00de; L n \u00f0Apr\u00f0X 0 \u00de\u00de\u00de and \u00f0Apr\u00f0X 0 \u00de; L n \u00f0Apr\u00f0X 0 \u00de\u00de\u00de be the learning cognitive concepts from an object set X 0 based on G LnHn . If Apr\u00f0X 0 \u00de \u00bc Apr\u00f0X 0 \u00de, there is only one learning cognitive concept from X 0 which is \u00f0H n L n \u00f0X 0 \u00de; L n \u00f0X 0 \u00de\u00de.\n\nProof. It is immediate from Eq. (26) . h\n\nIn summary, for a given object set X 0 , we learn an exact cognitive concept \u00f0H n L n \u00f0X 0 \u00de; L n \u00f0X 0 \u00de\u00de with the learning accuracy X x X x [ f\u00f0H n L n \u00f0x i \u00de; L n \u00f0x i \u00de\u00deg; According to Eq. (29), Steps 2-18 in Algorithm 2 are to compute the lower and upper approximations of the object set X 0 . Furthermore, Steps 19-24 are to find an exact or two approximate cognitive concepts for X 0 as well as the learning accuracy a\u00f0X 0 \u00de. What is more, it is easy to check that the time complexity of Algorithm 2 is O\u00f0jU n j 2 \u00fe jU n jjA n j \u00fe jA n j 2 \u00de.\n\nExample 5. Continued with Example 4, we suppose patients 3, 4 and 5 are children suffering from SARS, while patients 5 and 9 are old people suffering from SARS. Then which symptoms characterize these children (old people) exactly in terms of suffering from SARS? In order to answer this question, we need to learn cognitive concept(s) from the given object sets X 1 \u00bc f3; 4; 5g and X 2 \u00bc f5; 9g based on the obtained granular concepts G L 2 H 2 which can be found at the end of Example 4. By Eq. (29), we have\n\n;X 1 # X X \u00bc f3; 4; 5; 9g \\ U 2 \u00bc f3; 4; 5; 9g;\n\nThus, we learn two approximate cognitive concepts \u00f0f4; 5g; fa; cg\u00de and \u00f0f3; 4; 5; 9g; fcg\u00de from X 1 with the learning accuracy a\u00f0X 1 \u00de \u00bc 7 9 . Then we know that there do not exist some symptoms characterizing these children exactly in terms of suffering from SARS, but fever and headache can characterize them approximately and so can headache. Moreover, we learn an exact cognitive concept \u00f0f5; 9g; fc; eg\u00de from X 2 with a\u00f0X 2 \u00de \u00bc 1, which means that headache and diarrhea can characterize the old people exactly in terms of suffering from SARS.\n\nIn this subsection, we investigate the problem of learning one exact or two approximate cognitive concepts from a given attribute set by means of set approximations. Similar to the case in Section 5.1, we first propose an approach to approximate an attribute set in preparation for concept learning here.\n\nWe define the lower and upper approximations of an attribute set B 0 in B\u00f0U n ; A n ; L n ; H n \u00de as follows: \n\nThus, we consider \u00f0H n \u00f0Apr\u00f0B 0 \u00de\u00de; Apr\u00f0B 0 \u00de\u00de and \u00f0H n \u00f0Apr\u00f0B 0 \u00de\u00de; Apr\u00f0B 0 \u00de\u00de as the result of learning cognitive concepts from the attribute set B 0 by means of set approximations. Moreover, we define the (concept) learning accuracy as\n\nwhich is used to measure the accuracy of learning cognitive concepts from B 0 . Obviously, the learning accuracy b\u00f0B 0 \u00de equals 1 if and only if Apr\u00f0B 0 \u00de \u00bc Apr\u00f0B 0 \u00de. Similarly, the granular concepts G LnHn of a cognitive computing system are able to approximate an attribute set with the same result as the cognitive concept lattice B\u00f0U n ; A n ; L n ; H n \u00de. More precisely, we have the following proposition.\n\nProposition 10. Let B\u00f0U n ; A n ; L n ; H n \u00de be the cognitive concept lattice of the cognitive operators L n and H n , and G LnHn be the corresponding granular concepts. Then for any B 0 # A, we have\n\nThat is, are to learn one exact or two approximate cognitive concepts from B 0 as well as the learning accuracy b\u00f0B 0 \u00de. Moreover, it is easy to verify that the time complexity of Algorithm 3 is O\u00f0jU n j 2 \u00fe jU n jjA n j \u00fe jA n j 2 \u00de. Example 6. Continued with Example 4, we suppose fever and diarrhea receive more attention from doctors and so do headache and diarrhea. Then which patients as a whole suffer and only suffer from fever and diarrhea (headache and diarrhea)? In order to answer this question, we need to learn cognitive concept(s) from the given attribute sets B 1 \u00bc fa; eg and B 2 \u00bc fc; eg based on the obtained granular concepts G L 2 H 2 which can be found at the end of Example 4. By Eq. (35), we have . Then we know that there do not exist some patients as a whole suffering and only suffering from fever and diarrhea, but patient 5 suffers from fever, headache and diarrhea, and patients 1, 4, 5, 7 as a whole suffer from fever. Moreover, we learn an exact cognitive concept \u00f0f5; 9g; fc; eg\u00de from B 2 with b\u00f0B 2 \u00de \u00bc 1, which means that patients 5 and 9 as a whole suffer and only suffer from headache and diarrhea.\n\nIn this subsection, we study the problem of learning one exact or two approximate cognitive concepts from a pair of object and attribute sets by means of set approximations.\n\nFor a pair \u00f0X 0 ; B 0 \u00de of object and attribute sets, concept learning is quite different from that of an object set X 0 or attribute set B 0 . More precisely, for a given object set X 0 , we can consider it as \u00f0X 0 ; L n \u00f0X 0 \u00de\u00de in which L n \u00f0X 0 \u00de is an intent induced by X 0 . Similarly, for a given attribute set B 0 , we can consider it as \u00f0H n \u00f0B 0 \u00de; B 0 \u00de in which H n \u00f0B 0 \u00de is an extent induced by B 0 . However, for a given pair \u00f0X 0 ; B 0 \u00de, it is not known whether B 0 is an intent associated to X 0 , or X 0 is an extent associated to B 0 . Even sometimes, X 0 and B 0 are less associated with each other with respect to the extent-intent relationship, which means that in this case it may not be reasonable to learn cognitive concept(s) from the pair \u00f0X 0 ; B 0 \u00de. Motivated by this problem, we put forward the notion of a concept-inducible pair of object and attribute sets.\n\nDefinition 9. Let B\u00f0U n ; A n ; L n ; H n \u00de be the cognitive concept lattice of the cognitive operators L n and H n , and G LnHn be the corresponding granular concepts. For any X 0 # U n and B 0 # A n , if Apr\u00f0X 0 \u00de # H n \u00f0B 0 \u00de # Apr\u00f0X 0 \u00de and Apr\u00f0B 0 \u00de # L n \u00f0X 0 \u00de # Apr\u00f0B 0 \u00de, then \u00f0X 0 ; B 0 \u00de is said to be concept-inducible; otherwise, it is said to be concept-uninducible.\n\nExample 7. Continued with Examples 4-6, it can be known from Definition 9 that the pair \u00f0f3; 4; 5g; fa; eg\u00de is concept-uninducible since Apr\u00f0f3; 4; 5g\u00de # H n \u00f0fa; eg\u00de # Apr\u00f0f3; 4; 5g\u00de does not hold due to Apr\u00f0f3; 4; 5g\u00de \u00bc f4; 5g, H n \u00f0fa; eg\u00de \u00bc f5g and Apr\u00f0f3; 4; 5g\u00de \u00bc f3; 4; 5; 9g.\n\nIn what follows, we only focus on concept-inducible pairs for concept learning since concept-uninducible ones mean that the object set X 0 and the attribute set B 0 are less associated with each other with respect to the extent-intent relationship.\n\nProposition 12. Let B\u00f0U n ; A n ; L n ; H n \u00de be the cognitive concept lattice of the cognitive operators L n and H n , and G LnHn be the corresponding granular concepts. Then, for any X 0 # U n and B 0 # A n , \u00f0X 0 ; L n \u00f0X 0 \u00de\u00de and \u00f0H n \u00f0B 0 \u00de; B 0 \u00de are concept-inducible pairs.\n\nProof. Firstly, we prove that the pair \u00f0X 0 ; L n \u00f0X 0 \u00de\u00de is concept-inducible. On one hand, by Eq. Then it follows Apr\u00f0L n \u00f0X 0 \u00de\u00de # L n \u00f0X 0 \u00de # Apr\u00f0L n \u00f0X 0 \u00de\u00de. To sum up, we conclude that \u00f0X 0 ; L n \u00f0X 0 \u00de\u00de is concept-inducible.\n\nIn a similar manner, we can prove that the pair \u00f0H n \u00f0B 0 \u00de; B 0 \u00de is also concept-inducible. h\n\nCombining Proposition 12 with the discussion in the front of Section 5.3, we know that it is concept-inducible for the case of an object set or attribute set. This is why we directly implement concept learning in Sections 5.1 and 5.2.\n\nIn what follows, we discuss how to learn cognitive concept(s) from a concept-inducible pair of object and attribute sets. as the learning cognitive concepts from \u00f0X 0 ; B 0 \u00de by means of set approximations. Note that the formulas in Eqs. (40) and (41) are equal to \u00f0H n \u00f0Apr\u00f0B 0 \u00de\u00de; Apr\u00f0B 0 \u00de\u00de and \u00f0Apr\u00f0X 0 \u00de; L n \u00f0Apr\u00f0X 0 \u00de\u00de\u00de, respectively. Thus, we define the (concept) learning accuracy as Proof. It is immediate from Eqs. (38) and (39) . h\n\nIn particular, if the concept-inducible pair \u00f0X 0 ; B 0 \u00de is a cognitive concept, it is easy to verify that its learning cognitive concept is just itself.\n\nIn summary, for a given concept-inducible pair \u00f0X 0 ; B 0 \u00de, we learn an exact cognitive concept \u00f0H n \u00f0B 0 \u00de; L n \u00f0X 0 \u00de\u00de with the learning accuracy c\u00f0X 0 ; B 0 \u00de \u00bc 1 if Apr\u00f0X 0 \u00de \u00bc H n \u00f0Apr\u00f0B 0 \u00de\u00de and Apr\u00f0B 0 \u00de \u00bc L n \u00f0Apr\u00f0X 0 \u00de\u00de; otherwise, we can only learn two approximate cognitive concepts (see Eqs. (40) and (41) for details) with the learning accuracy c\u00f0X 0 ; B 0 \u00de < 1 (see Eq. (42) for details). It can be known from Definition 9 and Eqs. (40) and (41) that Algorithm 4 is designed to learn an exact or two approximate cognitive concepts (if any) from a pair of object and attribute sets. Moreover, it is easy to verify that the time complexity of Algorithm 4 is O\u00f0jU n j 2 \u00fe jU n jjA n j \u00fe jA n j 2 \u00de. Example 8. Continued with Example 5, where patients 3, 4 and 5 were supposed to be children suffering from SARS. Moreover, it can be seen from Table 2 that these children have the common symptom headache. Then, can these children and the symptom headache characterize each other in terms of suffering from SARS? In order to answer this question, we need to learn cognitive concept(s) from the pair \u00f0X 0 ; B 0 \u00de with X 0 \u00bc f3; 4; 5g and B 0 \u00bc fcg based on the obtained granular concepts G L 2 H 2 which can be found at the end of Example 4.\n\nIt is easy to verify that Apr\u00f0X 0 \u00de # H 2 \u00f0B 0 \u00de # Apr\u00f0X 0 \u00de and Apr\u00f0B 0 \u00de # L 2 \u00f0X 0 \u00de # Apr\u00f0B 0 \u00de can be satisfied simultaneously. By Definition 9, \u00f0X 0 ; B 0 \u00de is concept-inducible. Furthermore, according to Algorithm 4, we learn an exact cognitive concept \u00f0f3; 4; 5; 9g; fcg\u00de from \u00f0X 0 ; B 0 \u00de with the learning accuracy c\u00f0X 0 ; B 0 \u00de \u00bc 1. Thus, the children (i.e., patients 3, 4, 5) and the symptom headache cannot characterize each other in terms of suffering from SARS, but patients 3, 4, 5, 9 suffer and only suffer from headache and in the meanwhile the symptom headache characterizes patients 3, 4, 5 and 9 exactly.\n\nIn this section, we discuss the differences and relations between the proposed method and the existing ones on concept learning, and give explanations on some obtained results in this paper.\n\nFirstly, we analyze the differences from the following three aspects: (a) cognitive mechanism, (b) cognitive computing system, and (c) cognitive process.\n\nThe existing literature mainly focused on concept learning via concept systems (e.g., [18, 19, 31, 45] ) which were established by axiomatic ways, regardless of the analysis on cognitive mechanism. However, the current study has carefully analyzed the cognitive mechanism of forming concepts based on the principles from philosophy and cognitive psychology, and then naturally found the constraints for cognitive operators to better simulate intelligence behaviors of the brain including perception, attention and learning. The existing work put forward cognitive computing systems (e.g., [18, 19, 31, 45] ) by means of different axiomatic ways, which cannot integrate past experiences into itself to deal with e.g., dynamic data. However, the current study has proposed such a cognitive computing system that is composed of a series of cognitive computing states and is able to integrate past experiences into itself through recursive thinking. In addition, granular computing has also been integrated into the proposed cognitive computing system to decrease the computation time sharply. The existing researches on cognitive process mainly investigated the problem of learning concept(s) from a given pair of object and attribute sets by means of iterative algorithms [31, 45] , regardless of discussing whether the pair of object and attribute sets is concept-inducible or not, let alone the learning accuracy. However, the current paper has put forward the notion of a concept-inducible pair of object and attribute sets and a simple way of learning concept(s) from the concept-inducible pair via set approximations. What is more, how to measure the concept learning accuracy has been studied as well.\n\nSecondly, we analyze the relations between the proposed method and the existing ones from the following two aspects: (1) cognitive computing, and (2) application.\n\nThe existing work (e.g., [18, 19, 31, 45] ) showed to some extent pieces of the idea of cognitive computing in studying concept learning. For example, the importance of applying cognitive viewpoint to concept learning was mentioned in [45] . Learning concept(s) from a given pair of object and attribute sets by iterative algorithm was considered as a natural reflection of cognition. Motivated by these work, in this paper we have explicitly applied the idea of cognitive computing to concept learning based on granular computing, including a detailed discussion of cognitive mechanism, cognitive computing system and cognitive process. Both the proposed method and the existing ones allow users to specify the operators in the cognitive computing system. In other words, users can remould the operators according to their certain requirements of data analysis before learning concepts through the cognitive computing system.\n\nFinally, we give explanations on some obtained results in this paper. Some basic propositions (e.g., Propositions 1-4) of the proposed cognitive operators L and H are similar to those obtained by Zhang Wenxiu's research group [18, 19, 31] in formal concept analysis since L and H here form Galois connection as well. However, the difference is that the proposed cognitive operators are characterized by the axioms in Definition 1 which are from the principles in philosophy and cognitive psychology. Since the time complexities of Algorithms 1-4 are O\u00f0n\u00f0jU n j \u00fe jA n j\u00dejU n jjA n j\u00de; O\u00f0jU n j 2 \u00fe jU n jjA n j \u00fe jA n j 2 \u00de, O\u00f0jU n j 2 \u00fe jU n jjA n j \u00fe jA n j 2 \u00de and O\u00f0jU n j 2 \u00fe jU n jjA n j \u00fe jA n j 2 \u00de, respectively, the proposed concept learning method can be completed in polynomial time. However, the classical algorithms in [10] take exponential time in the worst case for concept learning. So, granular computing integrated into cognitive concept lattice can indeed improve the efficiency of concept learning.\n\nIn order to improve efficiency and flexibility of concept learning, this paper mainly focuses on concept learning via granular computing from the viewpoint of cognitive computing. To be more concrete, cognitive mechanism of forming concepts has been analyzed based on the principles from philosophy and cognitive psychology. Then granular computing has been combined with the cognitive concept lattice to improve the efficiency of concept learning. What is more, we have put forward a cognitive computing system which is the initial environment to learn composite concepts and can integrate past experiences into itself for enhancing the flexibility of concept learning. In addition, cognitive processes have also been investigated to deal with the problem of learning one exact or two approximate cognitive concepts from a given object set, attribute set or pair of object and attribute sets. The obtained results in this paper may be beneficial to simulating intelligence behaviors of the brain including perception, attention and learning, but it still needs to be further confirmed.\n\nIn fact, integrating the idea of cognitive computing into concept learning is a promising and challenging research direction. Although in this paper we have discussed it from the aspects of cognitive mechanism, cognitive computing system and cognitive process, an in-depth study of this issue still needs to be made in our future work. For instance, (i) how to deal with the problem of learning concept(s) from a concept-uninducible pair because in this paper we are only interested in conceptinducible pair in terms of concept learning from a pair of object and attribute sets; (ii) large databases in the real world should be conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed concept learning method; (iii) motivated by the logical reasoning work [36] in rough set theory, logical reasoning should also be integrated (if possible) into the proposed concept learning method for better simulating intelligence behaviors of the brain including perception, attention and learning."}
