{"title": "", "body": "information on hepatitis C and other bloodborne viruses is also needed in non-healthcare settings, particularly in practices where sharp instruments such as slicers that are likely to cause hand injuries are used and shared by workers. In these practices, healthcare authorities should highlight the importance of wearing gloves and the prevention of cutting injuries. 12 The detection of emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 and novel influenza A (H1N1), has become a continuous public health concern. Thus, the accurate diagnosis of pathogens in samples is becoming increasingly important. Currently, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), such as PCR, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification, loop-mediated isothermal amplification and DNA microarray, are used with greater frequency in preference to traditional cultureor antigen-based diagnostic procedures, primarily as a result of their greater sensitivity. However, almost all diagnostic NAATs require viral genome information in advance, and thus cannot be used to detect or characterize novel or unexpected viral infections. Likewise, these methods are completely ineffective if a viral genome has evolved sufficiently to result in point mutations at primer binding sites [1, 2] . New sequencing technologies referred to as 'second-generation,' such as 454 (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), Solexa (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) and SOLiD (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), show promise for the unbiased detection of pathogens. These systems allow researchers to obtain millions of sequences in a single round of operation, as well as an almost complete spectrum of nucleotide information through comparison and analysis with relevant databases. Because the 454 system has previously identified viral pathogens in nasal and faecal specimens [3] , we tested the ability of Solexa, another unbiased highthroughput sequencing platform, to detect viral infections in clinical specimens without using any viral genetic information in advance.\n\nIn the present study, four patient swab samples were obtained during novel influenza A (H1N1) outbreaks (samples 1, 2 and 3) and seasonal influenza virus A (H3N2) infections (sample 4) in May 2009 from the Laboratory of Beijing CDC, China. One swab sample from a healthy individual (sample 5) was used as a negative control.\n\nTotal RNA was isolated from each sample using the QIAamp RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Hildenberg, Germany). cDNA was synthesized using the M-MLV RTase cDNA synthesis kit (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan), and fragmented by nebulizers (Illumina, Inc.) to <800 bp. The overhangs resulting from fragmentation were converted into blunt ends using T4 DNA polymerase and Escherichia coli polymerase I Klenow fragment. After an 'A' base was added to the 3\u00a2 end, the adapters were ligated to the ends of the DNA fragments. Unligated adapters were then removed, after which the genomic DNA library was obtained by PCR (primer F: 5\u00a2-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCC TACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT-3\u00a2; primer R: 5\u00a2-CAAGCA GAAGACGGCATACGAGCTCTTCCGATCT-3\u00a2). Sequencing and sequence analysis were performed using the SBS sequencing kit v3 and the Genome Analyzer, respectively (Illumina, Inc.).\n\nThe quality of the sequencing reads from each sample was ensured by the parallel sequencing of in-house samples, and also included the removal of reads with unrecognized sites or sequencing adaptors, and duplicate reads. Valid reads were screened for host contaminants against the human reference genome using ELAND software, a part of the Solexa analysis pipeline [Cox AJ, unpublished data]. The remaining reads were searched among the microbes subset (viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa) of the RefSeq database [4] for taxonomy classification using MAQ software [5] .\n\nA summary of the sequencing data obtained using the Solexa system is shown in Fig. 1 . The relative ratio of reads matched with the RefSeq database to the total valid reads was 5-17% for each sample. As expected, the ratio of reads matched with human mRNA was in the range 39--56% because total RNA, and not just pathogenic RNA, was isolated from the swab samples. The other 19-44% reads matched with neither host mRNA, nor the RefSeq database, most likely because the RefSeq database mainly focuses on representative strains of taxonomically established organisms.\n\nSequences corresponding to hundreds of microbes in the swab samples were characterized directly from the sequencing reads matched with the RefSeq database. The fully-characterized microbes are shown in Table 1 . The ratio of bacteria was the highest at 63.48-89.65% of total valid reads per sample. The ratio of fungi, protozoa and viruses were between 2.14-14.34%, 3.57-31.71% and 0.13-0.53%, respectively.\n\nSequence analysis of all identified viral reads was performed to characterize any additional sequences. As shown in Table 1 , a BLAST search indicated that 44 (sample 1), 32 (sample 2) and 102 (sample 3) reads of the three samples were novel A (H1N1)-derived, strongly indicating that these patients were similarly infected with novel A (H1N1) virus, consistent with previous RT-PCR diagnostic results (Genebank accession number: GQ183617-GQ183624) [6] . Similarly, 254 reads of sample 4 were derived from seasonal A (H3N2) virus according to BLAST searches. Influenza virus was not detected in the control sample (sample 5). In addition, several common human virus-derived sequences, including adenovirus and herpesvirus were detected in all samples [7] . Maybe as a result of the addition of M-MLV reverse transcriptase during samples preparation, sequences corresponding to murine leukaemia virus were detected.\n\nNucleic acid sequence-based methods have been used extensively for the diagnosis of viral infection in recent years. However, most methods depend on prior knowledge of pathogen sequences, rendering them ineffective for detecting unexpected or mutated viral sequences. This limitation may be overcome by the use of new high-throughput sequencing strategies. In the present study, we demonstrate the potential of our unbiased pangenomic approach for identifying pathogenic viruses directly without advance genetic information. cDNAs, as templates for the Solexa platform, were prepared by random primer using RNAs extracted from clinical samples. The system produced >5.908 million reads per run within 48 h and enabled us to obtain an almost complete spectrum of nucleotide information from each sample, including bacteria, fungi, protozoa and viruses. Upon further analysis of identified viral reads, influenza sequences were present in 32-254 of the 158 327-580 424 valid reads in each sample (Table 1) . Importantly, the coverage rates were in the range 8.39-44.56%, which is sufficient for viral subtype identification. Novel A (H1N1) and seasonal A (H3N2) viruses were detected in the absence of prior genetic infor-mation, consistent with the classical RT-PCR diagnostic method. This suggests that this approach can contribute to the detection of unexpected or mutated virus by direct comparison with mutant and wild-type viral sequences in the Ref-Seq database. Likewise, pathogens eliciting similar symptoms could be distinguished in a single sample through analysis of unbiased high-throughput sequencing results, enabling the accurate diagnosis of mixed infection.\n\nThe study was supported in part by grants from the 'AIDS and viral hepatitis and other major infectious diseases prevention and control' technology projects ( Rotaviruses are the most important cause of acute gastroenteritis in humans and a variety of animals [1] . Rotaviruses possess a segmented, double-stranded RNA genome and are classified into seven groups (A-G) based on their distinctness with respect to genes and capsid proteins. Group A, B and C rotaviruses cause disease in both humans and animals [1] . Group C rotavirus (GpC RV), first detected in piglets [2] and an infant [3] , has been associated with sporadic cases and outbreaks of gastroenteritis among children and adults in many countries [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . GpC RV is generally considered to cause a relatively milder disease, with fewer episodes of vomiting per day and less dehydration compared to group A rotavirus (GpA RV) infection in children [4, 7] . All human GpC RV strains detected to date throughout the world have shown high sequence conservation and belong to single G and P genotypes [10,11]. By contrast, human GpC strains are divergent from those in cattle and swine [11] [12] [13] [14] . In the present study, for the first time, we detected GpC RV in faecal samples from children with acute diarrhoea in South Korea and determined the genetic relatedness of the Korean isolate to other published strains.\n\nA total of 434 stool samples was collected from patients <10 years of age, who were hospitalized for treatment of gastroenteritis at Sungmo Hospital, Icheon, South Korea, from November 2003 to January 2006. All 434 samples were screened for GpA RV by using a Rotatek\u00e4 kit (South Korea Green Cross Corp., Seoul, South Korea) [15] and, for GpC RV, by using an in-house immunoassay developed with hyperimmune sera against porcine GpC RV Cowden strain and human GpC RV VLPs [4, 16] . Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with porcine anti-GpC serum (U340; dilution 1:2000) or normal porcine serum (Z1329; dilution 1:2000) in coating buffer (35 mM NaHCO 3 , 15 mM Na 2 CO 3 , pH 9.6) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Plates were washed with phosphate buffered saline-Tris (pH 7.6) and incubated with blotto for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Plates were washed and then incubated with diluted stool samples (dilution 1:10) or GpC VLPs (positive"}
