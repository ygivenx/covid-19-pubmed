{"title": "Disease in endangered metapopulations: the importance of alternative hosts", "body": "Over the past decade, metapopulation dynamics has come to have an increasingly important role in conservation planning. Theory predicts that movement between subpopulations should increase the number of patches that are occupied at equilibrium, the genetic effective size of the metapopulation and the time delay to metapopulation extinction (Hanski & Gilpin 1997) . For this reason, many conservationists have favoured measures-such as construction of corridors, or active translocation of individuals-which encourage migration between patches.\n\nIn a recent paper, however, Hess (1996) suggested a negative aspect to such migration. Infectious disease represents a serious extinction risk to threatened species, having the capacity to cause populations to crash suddenly, as well as slowing their recovery from perturbations (Woodroffe 1999) . Using a metapopulation model, Hess (1996) showed that, by facilitating the spread of disease between subpopulations, migration could increase the probability of metapopulation extinction and reduce patch occupancy. We believe that this conclusion is likely to be misleading for many wild populations and demonstrate the reason in a simple modification of Hess's model. The analytic model developed by Hess assumes that susceptible subpopulations become infected only by receiving immigrants from elsewhere within the metapopulation (Hess 1996) . By contrast, most of the infections that have threatened wildlife populations with extinction have 'spilled over' from other, more abundant hosts (table 1; Woodroffe 1999; McCallum & Dobson 1995) . We have modelled this phenomenon by altering the Hess model, to include a background force of infection. Our intention is not to evaluate the likelihood of such a spillover, but to explore the relationship between within-population migration rates and disease in those populations for which spillover occurs.\n\nLike the Hess model, our model contains a proportion, S, of susceptible host patches (containing a host population, but no disease), and I, of infected host patches (containing a host population with disease present). Susceptible and infected populations become extinct at rates x S and x I , respectively (x S \u03fd x I ), with migration occurring from both susceptible and infected patches at a rate m. On arrival at a susceptible patch, an infected disperser infects the resident population with probability \u2426; thus, infection spreads at a migration-dependent rate m\u2426IS. In addition, and as an extension to the analytic Hess model, susceptible populations may become infected from an outside source, at a rate g, similarly to the 'propagule rain' concept analysed by Gotelli (1991) . Such an external force of infection was included in the simulation models of Hess, although set at a very low level, to initiate the epidemic. The possible events in the model are given in table 2.\n\nFirst, we investigate the effects of this extra term in the context of a deterministic system. We use the following mean field model for the proportion of patches occupied in the different states, thus:\n\nFrom this, we find the stable equilibria (Appendix A) and use these to plot equilibrium total occupancy rates against migration rates in figure 1. When g = 0 (i.e. in the Hess model) and for some range of g, occupancy rates initially increase with migration rate, then decrease as infection becomes established and a greater proportion of patches experience the higher extinction rates associated with infection. Eventually, occupancy increases once more, as all patches become infected and migration acts only to promote host population persistence. It is the nonmonotonicity of this curve that underlies Hess's con- Table 1 . Examples of wildlife populations which have been threatened by infectious disease. The majority of cases involve generalist pathogens which have apparently 'spilled over' from other, more abundant, host species. Note that a welldocumented case of infection transmitted between populations by translocation (Castle & Christensen 1990 ) involved a pathogen believed to cause only subclinical infections, which are likely to have little or no effect upon population viability. threatened host pathogen impact of pathogen probable source references African wild dog rabies population extinction domestic dogs Gascoyne et al.

Possible events and corresponding rates for the model. This reduces to the analytic model of Hess (1996) clusion that encouraging migration between patches may increase, rather than decrease, the probability of metapopulation extinction. This non-monotonicity is continued for a range of g. For greater values of g we see an entirely monotonic curve meaning that increasing movement rates only increases occupancy in this model. To gain some sense of the magnitude of the critical value of g, we define \u2440 to be (1 \u03ea x S /x I ). This is the expected reduction in patch persistence time that occurs when infection is present. We find our curve becomes monotonic at g = x S \u2440 2 /(1 \u03ea \u2440 2 ) in terms of this new parameter. To give an example, suppose that the disease reduces the life expectancy of a patch by one-third; under these conditions the occupancy fraction is monotonic whenever the chance of external infection is greater than one-eighth of the chance of extinction for a susceptible Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B (2002) patch. These spontaneous extinction rates are typically low and our analysis indicates that critical rates of external infection are an order of magnitude still smaller. Thus, the negative effects of increasing movement rates on patch occupancy are eliminated in parameter ranges possibly encountered in natural systems.\n\nThis shows that the conclusion from Hess's deterministic model is sensitive to a perturbation by the inclusion of an independent force of infection. This suggests that the exact form of this force is unlikely to be important. We would expect qualitatively the same results, were we to impose some structure such as only half the patches being subject to this risk of external infection, because of spatial structure in alternative hosts, for example, or if we were to link this risk to movement rates (for example if we made g proportional to m). \n\nThe results of this deterministic analysis can only yield occupancy fractions, but for many conservation purposes, extinction rates may be a more appropriate measure of the costs and benefits of movement between subpopulations. To confirm that occupancy fractions are a reasonable proxy for this measure, and more importantly to test the robustness of our results, we now move to a stochastic model based on the same underlying model processes.\n\nThe pair of coordinates (S,I ) completely characterizes the present state. The rates of transition between states are given in table 2. Rather than simply simulating a number of realizations of this system, this paper makes use of the Markov properties of this system. We may easily construct the explicit continuous time Markov transition matrix for these rates (Grimmett & Stirzaker 1992 ). This will be a large (of the order N 2 \u00d7 N 2 ), sparse (six non-zero entries per row) matrix. We can show that extinction is the unique absorbing state and also that all states communicate with it. Thus, the transition matrix has a unique Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B (2002) zero eigenvalue that corresponds to extinction and all other eigenvalues have a strictly negative real part. The asymptotic rate of extinction is the largest real part among these eigenvalues.\n\nIn formulating our deterministic model, we assumed that a high occupancy fraction in the deterministic model corresponded with a high chance of survival over a long time-scale; our stochastic model is designed to test this. To compare with the deterministic results, figure 2 shows the results in the form of probability of survival over a given time. The results from the stochastic model broadly support the conclusions of the deterministic approach, demonstrating in figure 2 the non-monotonicity in m at low g, which fades out to leave a monotonic curve for g around the critical value of g, calculated from the deterministic model. In the special case of g = 0, the subset of states with no sites infected is absorbing and the quasistationary state of the system is disease free. Hence, for g = 0, there is always monotonicity in the expected survival probabilities. In this respect, and for this special case, the deterministic and stochastic models disagree. \n\nUsing both a deterministic and a stochastic approach, we have shown that the simple metapopulation model with disease is sensitive to a perturbation that introduces infection from outside the system at probability g. We have also demonstrated that the threshold value of g at which such a perturbation becomes important is small, in comparison with the probability that a healthy patch becomes extinct, which we assume to be low. Thus, where subpopulations risk infection through contact with alternative hosts, as well as by immigration of infected conspecifics, the net effect of increased migration will often be entirely positive. If there is much background infection disease is already widespread and increasing movement rates will have little further negative impact. It is intuitively clear that at high external infection rates, the benefits will always outweigh the costs of an increased movement rate.\n\nWe emphasize that what our analysis demonstrates is that it is also true at surprisingly low levels of background, and that low levels of background infection are to be expected in many natural systems.\n\nThese results suggest that, for wild populations in which a high proportion of infections 'spill over' from alternative host species, migration between patches is likely to promote, rather than reduce, patch occupancy. Thus, corridors that encourage movement are likely to be beneficial in this context, although of course extinction rates in the presence of external infection are always higher than in its absence. However, Hess's model may be more applicable to the captive situation, where transfer of animals between captive facilities, or between captive and wild populations, are a known cause of disease outbreaks (table 3) . Detection of infected animals intended for translocation or release (e.g. Karesh & Cook 1995) indicates that veterinary screening and quarantine procedures (e.g . Cooper 1989; Woodford & Rossiter 1994) are effective in limiting disease transmission between populations, as predicted by Hess (1996) , and must be incorporated into translocation strategies.\n\nThere are other complexities in the relationship between migration rates and disease. Highly virulent pathogens may prevent the carrier completing migration; the stresses of migration may act particularly on infected animals, thus modifying the disease profile of a migrating group; and the effect of any pathogen brought into a new population will depend heavily on the degree of physiological stress that the population is under.\n\nAn important caveat to this analysis is the possibility that measures that encourage migration between patches may also increase contact between threatened species and alternative hosts. If alternative hosts occur primarily outside reserves (as would be expected if reservoir hosts are domestic species), then corridors might increase contact between host species by increasing the reserves' perimeter-area ratios. Such 'edge effects' would compound other extinction risks associated with exposure to reserve borders (Woodroffe & Ginsberg 1998) . This possibility might be investigated by adding an external force of infection to the spatially explicit simulations proposed by Hess (1996) . Our analyses emphasize the need for conservation managers to take an ecological approach to disease control, involving the management of reservoir as well as threatened host species (Woodroffe 1999) .\n\nWe thank George Hess for helpful discussions.
