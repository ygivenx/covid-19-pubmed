Therefore, despite high lethality, 126 the rate of epidemic increase appears to be relatively slow, prompting predictive modelling of 127 population level impacts over time spans well beyond those covered by field observations.\n\nIn general, there are three potential long-term outcomes of host-pathogen interactions: biting behaviour with other individuals (Fig 1) .
