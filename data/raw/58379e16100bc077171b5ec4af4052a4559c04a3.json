{"title": "A cascade reaction network mimicking the basic functional steps of acquired immune response", "body": "of AM, BM and PG were annealed at concentrations of around 50 \u00b5M in 1\uf0b4TAE-Mg buffer (20 mM Tris-Acetate-EDTA, pH 7.5, 12.5 mM Mg(Ac) 2 ). Native PAGE gels (10%) in 1\uf0b4TAE-Mg buffer were run at 100 V for 90 minutes at 4\u00b0C and stained with Gel Red stain solution (Biotium, Hayward, CA). Only the sharp bands were cut from the gels, chopped into small pieces, and soaked in 1\uf0b4TAE-Mg buffer for 24 hours. After soaking out most DNA molecules from the gel pieces, the solutions were extracted and concentrated with centrifugal filter devices (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Finally, the DNA duplex sequences were quantified by UV spectrometry and kept in buffer for future use.\n\nWe hypothesized the feasibility of designing a network of chemical reactions able to function in a manner similar to the vertebrate acquired immune system, using DNA and enzyme as simplified artificial analogs to mimic the activation and deployment of acquired immune response at its most fundamental level. This chemical reaction network, termed AIRS, couples DNA-enzyme cascade interactions with DNA strand displacement cascades in which a new product can be activated by the presence of some initiators, thus allowing many such reactions to be linked into a cascade and even form a complex network, in particular one such as adaptive immunity where biological events follow each other sequentially in a rolling fashion.\n\nThe host innate immune system is the first line of defense against invading pathogens, but its effect is nonspecific and short-lived. In contrast, the adaptive, or acquired, immune system is composed of both humoral and cell-mediated components that are called to action when immune tolerance is surpassed. More specifically, adaptive immunity involves the production of antibodies and immunological memory, but also cell-mediated responses, including the key steps of antigen presentation, antigen binding, co-stimulation and destruction of the foreign body (e.g., phagocytosis). A key function is antigen presentation which provides the mechanism for recognition and response. While B cells secrete antibodies, which bind to and label an antigen, T cells perform the job of attacking target cells. Both T and B cells have roles in immunological memory. We have divided this series of events into three steps, including Recognition and Tolerance, Immune Response, and Killing and Memory, under the control of four functional DNA components, including DNA duplexes AM (Antigen Presenting Cell (APC) Mimicry), BM (B Cell Mimicry), PG (Primer Generator, which generates primers for analog antibody) and single-stranded circular DNA CT (Circular Template, which controls the sequence of analog antibody), as well as two enzymes (Phi29 DNA polymerase and SsPI restriction enzyme) able to autonomously and programmably respond to an incoming piece of single-stranded DNA pathogen input (P 0 ) taken from bacterial genome. When no P 0 is present, the system is maintained in a steady, balanced state by effective blocking of the functional domains in each component. However, when challenged by increased load of viral P 0 , these functional domains are activated in a series of steps designed to mimic the three steps noted above.\n\nIn AIRS, this step depends on the core sequence of pathogen input P 0 , which is composed of two effective domains. The first domain, (P), is a genomic sequence taken from B. anthracis for pathogen mimicry. The second domain, (domain 2-3-4), is designed for systematic cascade reaction, i.e., DNA displacement reaction in steps 1 and 2. Accordingly, AM, BM and PG, as defined above, were all designed to interact with P 0 . All DNA strands in the circuit consist of recognition domains (20-44 nt) and toehold domains (5-10 nt), and these domains are functionally independent. The toehold domains were used to initiate the subsequent branch migration reactions. To differentiate the displacement reaction rates between P 0 and AM, as well as between P 0 and BM, a 10-nt long toehold (2a*3*) was used in AM, and a 0-nt long toehold was designed in BM. As discussed in the previous kinetic model above, the predicted reaction rate differences between P 0 and AM or P 0 and BM are about 1000 x. 1\n\nStep 2: Immune Response\n\nWhen immune tolerance has been surpassed, antigen-specific immune response is triggered to eliminate foreign agents. Many mechanisms act in a coordinated and sequential manner to recruit different cell populations, mainly B and T cells, and promote the production of antibodies, as well as proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. For example, after antigens have been transported to lymph nodes, they are digested into smaller fragments for presentation by Antigen Presenting Cells (typically B cells), allowing for T cell recognition and the initiation of cytotoxic processes, such as the production of cytokines and antibodies.\n\nFirst, it is enzymatic amplification (RCA) that controls the amount of antibody mimicry P* generated. As indicated previously, an efficient isothermal enzyme-based amplification, termed rolling-circle amplification (RCA), provides us with an excellent way to specifically produce a large amount of desired DNA product in a short time and at a constant temperature, thus mimicking the generation of antibody in our network. To demonstrate that the concentration of RCA product depends on the amount of primer, different concentrations of ssDNA primer were incubated with 50 nM CT, 0.5 U/\u00b5L Phi29 and 250 \u00b5M dNTP in RCA buffer. To perform this experiment, we designed a DNA molecular beacon (MB-R) to report the amount of RCA product fluorescently by using B. anthracis genomic sequence (P) as its loop. MB-R could be opened by the RCA products, i.e., P*, thereby exhibiting fluorescence restoration that represents different amounts of P*. Figure S8A shows the resultant fluorescence curve establishing the quantitative relationship between P* and released primer. This allowed the quantity of P* generated from enzymatic amplification for hybridization with domain P in P 0 , P 1 and P 2 to be determined by the upstream reactions in steps 1 and 2.\n\nNext, to design a more sensitive reporting system to indicate the amount of generated RCA product (P*), we applied the amplification circuit motif comprised of two DNA hairpins developed by Li et al. 2 and Jiang et al. 3 In principle, two DNA hairpin structures, A 1 and A 2 , initially do not hybridize with each other because of the effective block created by complementary domains. However, in the presence of another ssDNA sequence, termed catalyst (C), A 1 and A 2 can form a stable duplex without consuming C. As shown in Figure S9 , A 1 , A 2 and C contain a few functional domains labeled in lowercase letters. Complementarity between lettered domains is denoted by an asterisk. Initially, C can hybridize with the exposed toehold domain a of A 1 and gradually open the stem of A 1 to form intermediate A 1 C, but A 1 C has an exposed ssDNA domain c* able to hybridize with the exposed domain c in A 2 . Hence, after hybridization of c and c*, the sequence dc*b*d will undergo branch migration and displace the C sequence (c*b*a*) to form the A 12 duplex. Importantly, the released C triggers further hybridizations of A 1 and A 2 in repeating cycles, thus providing the multiple-trigger effect absent in previous models. The overall reaction is driven by a decrease in enthalpy resulting from the formation of A 12 with a greater number of base pairs.\n\nTo apply this amplification circuit for detecting the amount of antibody P*, we encoded the sequence P* into the catalyst C sequence and designed A 1 and A 2 correspondingly. Because of the high amplification efficiency of the circuit, this system can report the amount of P* more sensitively compared to the molecular beacon-based method (MB-R). As shown in Figure S10 , when the amount of pathogen is under the level of immune tolerance (threshold of 200 nM), it can be observed that the fluorescence kinetics is similar to that without P 0 . However, when another 150 nM P 0 were added to the system after the first addition of 100 nM to mimic a second exposure to the same pathogen, the fluorescence restoration showed much faster kinetics behavior.\n\nIt was found that sequence design in this system could be affected by unspecific elongation of polymerase Phi29. Such unexpected elongation could represent a serious design flaw because it can seal all the toehold regions that initiate the strand displacement. Therefore, since Phi29 is a universal polymerase which can only recognize natural 3'-end of a DNA duplex, we first modified an artificial Inverted dT group at the 3'-end of each DNA component. As a consequence, DNA duplex could form a parallel linkage (3'-3') to impart duplex exonuclease resistance and thus prevent extension by polymerases in the absence of free 3' hydroxyl group to initiate synthesis. 4, 5 Importantly, however, the primer strand (12a) cannot be modified with Inverted dT group, as it is designed for polymerase recognition and elongation and should not be initially blocked. Therefore, to prevent unexpected elongation from the 3'-end of primer strand, which could result in sealing the toehold of PG duplex when incubated with Phi29, we designed 1 or 2 mismatch points between the primer (12a) and its complementary strand (1*2a*b*) in PG at the 3'-end of primer (Fig. S8B ). An experiment was carried out to demonstrate the ability of these mismatched points to prevent the undesired sealing of Phi29. Specifically, these mismatched PG duplexes labeled by FRET pairs (FAM-DABCYL) were incubated with 0.1 U/\u00b5l or 1 U/\u00b5l Phi29 for 1 hour. Afterwards, different amounts of ssDNA PI (upstream displacement strand) were added to the system to explore fluorescence restoration. If the toehold of PG were found to be sealed by Phi29, the results would show the displacement reaction between PI and PG to be negligible, leading to low fluorescence recovery. As shown in Figure   S8 , 2 mismatched bases provided the best anti-elongation effect by showing the greatest fluorescence restoration. We did not test 3 or more mismatches in PG because the increasing instability of PG might have caused greater signal leakage in the system. Thus, as a tradeoff against too much elongation, but too little stability, we chose 2 mismatch bases in PG duplex for the implementation of our system.\n\nThe sequence of CT was designed by encoding two Bacillus anthracis genomic sequence fragments (P) inside. These two P sequences were separated by a linker composed of ten T nucleotides. Here, because of the encoding of Bacillus anthracis genomic sequence fragments (P) in CT, the generated RCA product (P*) is only able to recognize pathogen P 0 , thus providing the first layer of systematic selectivity. Additionally, P 0 -mis-P* mismatch duplex cannot form an effective recognition binding site with the restriction enzyme SsPI (AAT-ATT), thereby reducing the enzyme's digestion rate, which, in turn, results in much less cleavage product from input P 0 -mis ( Figure S11) . Therefore, the design of this AIRS mimicry system possesses the character of antigen-specific immune response similar to that of the actual host immune defense system. "}
