{"title": "Supplementary Material Supplementary Text", "body": "open conformation is only 5.5 4 10 \uf02d \uf0b4 , implying that the mRNA duplex is in fact always in the closed conformation. Then, it is difficult to understand why a fraction of the normal translocations (25%) occur and another fraction of the \"uncoupled\" translocations (75%) occur. Moreover, as the \"uncoupled\" translocation involves no reverse intersubunit rotation, then how the \"uncoupled\" translocation occurs is unclear.\n\nIn addition, since after EF-G release from State R2 (Fig. S1 ) the state becomes similar to State R5 (Fig. S1) , why EF-G.GTP cannot bind to State R2 and then catalyzes the reverse intersubunit rotation whereas EF-G.GTP can bind to State R5 and then catalyzes the reverse intersubunit rotation is not clear.\n\nAvailable experimental data (Chen et al., 2013; Takyar et al., 2005; Qu et al., 2011) and analyses (Xie, 2014a; 2014b) indicated that the 30S subunit of the ribosome covers about 12 bases (four codons) of the single-stranded mRNA from its P site to the mRNA entry site. Thus, when the 30S P site is occupying GCA 21 codon of the wild-type mRNA used in the experiments of Chen et al. (2014) , the G 34 :C base pair is just outside the mRNA entry site (see Fig. S2b ); and when the 30S P site is occupying AAA 24 codon, three G:C base pairs in the mRNA stem loop are unwound (see Fig. S2c ). Moreover, it is considered that when the 30S P site is occupying GCA 21 codon, the anti-Shine-Dalgarno (anti-SD) of 16S rRNA is in the same position of the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence of the mRNA along the translation direction (see Fig. S2b ). Under this consideration, we study the probability of the effective translocation during translation of each codon on the mRNA.\n\n(i). During the translation of codons before codon GCA 21 , no downstream mRNA base pair is required to unwind during the translocation step and moreover, since the anti-SD is far away from the SD, there is no the SD:anti-SD interaction. Thus, no resistance is present to hinder the translocation, as during the translation through the single-stranded mRNA, giving the probability of effective translocation, (1) E P = 1.\n\n(ii). During the translation of codon GCA 21 , the translocation (from Fig. S2a to S2b) also requires no unwinding of mRNA base pair. Moreover, the SD:anti-SD interaction facilitates the translocation. Thus, the reverse intersubunit rotation gives a 100% probability of the effective translocation.\n\n(iii). During the translation of codon AAA 24 , the translocation (from Fig. S2b to S2c) requires unwinding of three G:C base pairs, giving an increase in free energy of 3E bp , and moreover, due to the SD:anti-SD interaction the translocation (from Fig.   S2b to S2c) also gives an increase in free energy of\n\nThus, the effective-translocation probability (1) E P can be calculated by\n\nEq. (S2) is the same as Eq. (19). As shown in Section 3.4, we have (1 \n\nAs determined in Section 3.1, E bp = 2.5k B T. As determined previously (Xie, 2013) , (24), it is seen that even with the second term of Eq. (24) being negligibly smaller than the first term, this (1) E P = 0.82 that is slightly smaller than 1\n\ngives the mean rotated-state lifetime T R2 to be slightly larger than T R1 , which is consistent with the experimental data [see, e.g., Figure 1d and Extended Data Figure   5c -f in Chen et al. (2014) ].\n\n(v). During the translation of codon AGU 30 , the translocation requires unwinding of two U:A base pairs and one G:C base pair, giving an increase in free energy of ( : ) "}
