{"title": "Running title: The transcriptional and translational landscape of equine torovirus 1", "body": "sequences and the inferred amino acid sequences are subject to purifying selection, 27\n\nindicating that U1 and U2 are functionally relevant. This study provides the first high-28 resolution analysis of transcription and translation in this neglected group of 29 livestock pathogens. 30\n\nToroviruses infect cattle, goats, pigs and horses worldwide and can cause 32 gastrointestinal disease. There is no treatment or vaccine and their ability to spill 33 over into humans has not been assessed. These viruses are related to important 34 human pathogens including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 35 and they share some common features, however the mechanism that they use to 36 produce subgenomic RNA molecules differs. Here we performed deep sequencing to 37 determine how equine torovirus produces subgenomic RNAs. In doing so, we also 38 identified two previously unknown open reading frames \"hidden\" within the 39 genome. Together these results highlight the similarities and differences between 40 this domestic animal virus and related pathogens of humans and livestock. 41\n\nThe order Nidovirales currently contains four families of positive-sense, single-44 stranded RNA viruses: the Coronaviridae, Arteriviridae, Roniviridae and 45\n\nMesoniviridae (1). Their grouping into the one taxonomic order is based upon 46 replicase protein conservation, genome organisation and replication strategy. 47 mechanism, the preceding leader sequence incorporated into this mRNA is merely 6 103 nt in length (ACGUAU). Additionally, this case is unusual in that the translocation 104 event is thought to be prompted by an RNA structure -a predicted RNA hairpin 105 upstream of the S protein gene, rather than a body TRS (12). Body TRSs are located 106 upstream of the three remaining structural protein genes, yet a non-discontinuous 107 mechanism is utilised for their production, as is the case for roniviruses. As a result, 108 the sg mRNAs for membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and haemagglutinin-esterase 109 (HE) do not normally possess a conserved 5' leader sequence; they each possess a 110 variable and unique extended version of the TRS at their 5' end. It is clear there is 111 significant difference between how the various Nidovirales families synthesise their 112\n\nHere we describe the first high-resolution analysis of viral transcription during 114 infection by EToV, which is one of the few toroviruses that can be propagated in cell 115 culture (13, 14) . RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) confirmed previous reports that EToV 116 utilises a unique combination of both discontinuous and non-discontinuous RNA 117 synthesis to generate its repertoire of sgRNAs. Strikingly, we also identified a small 118 proportion of chimaeric transcripts spanning from the leader to the body TRS of the 119 N protein gene, indicating that discontinuous and non-discontinuous mechanisms 120 compete in this location. We also identified numerous locations across the genome 121\n\nwhere non-canonical RdRp translocation occurs, leading to a vast array of 122 (presumably mostly non-functional) chimaeric transcripts. 123\n\nRibosome profiling (Ribo-seq) conducted in tandem with the RNA-seq indicated 124 ribosomes were actively translating within the so-called 5' UTR. Further analysis 125 confirmed the existence of two novel ORFs in this region, which are conserved in all 126 torovirus genome sequences analysed to date. The specific function(s) of these 127 proteins will be the topic of future work. Together, these results provide an overview 128 of the transcriptional and translational events that accompany infection by this wide-129 ranging pathogen. 130\n\nTandem RNA-seq and Ribo-seq of EToV infected cells. We conducted tandem RNA-132 seq and Ribo-seq of EToV infected equine dermal (ED) cells. Two biological replicates 133 of virus-infected and mock-infected cells were analysed, generating 25 to 53 million 134 reads per sample. For RNA-seq, 77-92 % of reads mapped to the host genome, of 135 which a mean of 1.5 % mapped to rRNA, 19 % to mRNA, 32 % to ncRNA and 47 % 136 elsewhere in the genome. For Ribo-seq, 46-60 % of reads mapped to the host 137 genome, of which a mean of 56 % mapped to rRNA, 13 % to mRNA, 4.9 % to ncRNA 138 and 26 % elsewhere in the genome (Supplementary Table 1 ). 1.3 % and 2.3 % of 139 reads mapped to the virus genome in the two EToV-infected RNA-seq replicates and 140 0.41 % and 0.21 % in the two virus-infected Ribo-seq replicates. 141\n\nThe viral genome was assembled de novo from RNA-seq reads and confirmed as 142\n\nEToV, Berne isolate. A single 27694-nt contig was assembled representing almost the 143 entire viral genome. Only 18 nt at the 5' terminus and 300 nt at the 3' terminus of 144 this contig failed to assemble automatically; however these regions were clearly 145 covered by reads consistent with the reference sequence on inspection and so were 146 added manually to the consensus sequence. Four single nucleotide changes were 147 present in all reads but not the reference sequence compiled from previous 148 sequencing data, at positions 18078 (ORF 1b, C > U), 21429 (ORF S, A > U), 21814 149 (ORF S, C > A) and 25596 (ORF S, C > U). The full-length virus sequence has been 150 deposited in GenBank (Accession MG996765). 151\n\nThe distribution of reads on the virus genome and the phasing of these reads are 152 shown in Figure 2 . There was good coverage across the viral genome for both seq and Ribo-seq. The Ribo-seq/RNA-seq ratio along the genome was calculated 154 ( Figure 2C ) to estimate translation efficiency (note that this simple estimate is naive 155 since it does not account for the fact that the genomic RNA and different sgRNA 156 species overlap one another). Ribo-seq density, RNA-seq density and translational adjusted based on the \"decumulation\" methodology described previously (15) (see 162\n\nMaterials and Methods) to account for the fact that not all of the RNA-seq density in 163 the 3' ORFs derives from transcripts from which the ORFs can be expressed. Ribo-seq 164 coverage is much higher towards the 3' end of the genome, particularly across the M 165 and N genes, reflecting the translation of abundant subgenomic RNAs in this region 166 ( Figure 2, Figure 3 ). ORFs 1a and 1b contain a considerably lower density of Ribo-seq 167 reads. The relatively low translation efficiencies calculated for ORFs 1a and 1b may 168 be partly due to some gRNA being packaged (or destined for packaging) and 169 unavailable for translation but still contributing to the estimate of gRNA RNA-seq 170 density. ORF1a has a higher Ribo-seq density and a higher translational efficiency 171 than ORF1b, reflecting the proportion of ribosomes terminating at the ORF1a stop 172 codon and not undergoing the -1 frameshift into ORF1b (Figure 2, Figure 3 ). As 173 expected, RNA-seq density is similar across ORF1a and ORF1b, as both are present 174 only on the full-length genomic RNA ( Figure 2 ). The region covering the HE ORF also 175 has low ribosomal coverage (Figure 2 ), which may be due to the fact that the EToV 176 HE gene is nonfunctional due to a large deletion including the canonical AUG (16). HE 177 is not shown in Figure 3 as the HE transcript is much less abundant than the 178 \"upstream\" M transcript which makes the decumulation procedure susceptible to 179 noise (see Irigoyen et al., 2016) . Translational efficiency appears highest for the M 180 and S subgenomic RNAs. The high RNA-seq density in the 5' UTR may be indicative of 181 one or more defective interfering (DI) RNAs in the sample (see below). Ribosome 182 protected fragments (RPFs) were also identified mapping to the second half of the 5' 183 UTR, mostly in the +2/-1 frame with respect to ORF1a ( Figure 2A) . 184\n\nTo calculate the length distributions of host-and virus-mapped RPFs, we used reads 185 mapping within coding regions. After adaptor trimming, the majority (75 %) of Ribo-186 seq reads were 27 -29 nt in length, which is consistent with the expected size of 187 mammalian ribosome footprints. As expected, the distribution of read lengths for 188 RNA-seq was much broader, peaking between 60 and 70 nt (Supplementary Figure  189   1 ). For quality control, histograms of the 5' end positions of host mRNA Ribo-seq and 190\n\nRNA-seq reads relative to initiation and termination codons were constructed 191 ( Supplementary Figures 2, 3 ). This confirmed we had high quality RPFs arising from 192 host transcripts, with strong triplet periodicity (\"phasing\") and very few reads 193 mapping to 3' UTRs. As in other datasets, a ramp effect of decreased RPF density was 194 seen over a region of ~30 codons following initiation sites; but, unusually, in this 195 dataset we did not observe a density peak at the initiation site itself (cf. Irigoyen et al 196 2016) . This may be due to the flash freezing without cycloheximide pretreatment 197 used for these samples, as for a later cycloheximide-treated sample this peak is The relative RPF density allowed us to estimate the efficiency of ribosomal 202 frameshifting in the context of virus infection. After translating ORF1a, a proportion 203 of ribosomes undergo a \u22121 ribosomal frameshift to translate ORF1b (17). This is 204 (presumably) required to produce a specific ratio of pp1a to pp1ab, thereby 205 controlling the ratio of RNA-synthesing enzymes such as RdRp and helicase to other 206 components of the replicase complex, including the proteinases and trans-207 membrane subunits encoded in ORF1a. The ORF1a/1b \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting 208 event is stimulated by a pseudoknot structure 3'-adjacent to the U_UUA_AAC 209 slippery heptanucleotide frameshift site. The efficiency of \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting 210 (measured by dividing the mean RPF density in ORF1b by the mean density in ORF1a) 211 was estimated to be 29.9 % for replicate one and 27.5 % for replicate 2, which is in 212 accordance with the rates measured previously outside of the context of virus 213 infection (20 -30 %) (17). 214\n\nare utilised for N protein gene sgRNA synthesis. RNA sequencing reads that did not 216 map to either the viral genome or host databases were analysed for containing 217 potential viral chimaeric junctions, indicative of leader-to-body joining during 218 discontinuous sgRNA synthesis ( Figure 4 ). Relative abundances were calculated by 219 normalising read counts to the number of non-chimaeric reads spanning each 220 junction. Between the two replicates combined, 8330 reads were identified as 221 chimaeras, mapping to 2837 putative junction sites. Of these, 213 were considered 222 to be highly supported by the data, either due to being identified in at least 10 223 chimaeric reads or containing the full 5' leader and TRS sequence. Adjacent donor or 224 acceptor sites were then merged (see Materials and Methods), leaving 70 unique 225 junctions ( Figure 4) . 226\n\nThree chimaeric junctions were identified where the first nucleotide of the 227 corresponding read mapped to the first nucleotide of the viral genome. Of these, 228 one junction was consistent with the previously characterised sgRNA produced via 229 discontinuous RNA synthesis encoding the S gene (280 reads, or 3 % of total 230 chimaeric reads) (12). These reads spanned the entire leader-body junction of the S 231 gene, possessing 14 -18 nt of the 5' UTR (i.e. the actual 5'-derived sequence is at 232 least 14 nt, ACGUAUCUUUAGAA, comprising the so-called 6-nt leader, the leader TRS 233 CUUUAGA, and an additional A), followed by the stretch of ORF1b just upstream of 234 the S gene. A second set of transcripts containing 5' leader sequence was identified 235 by four unique reads starting with the 5' leader (ACGUAU) and TRS sequence 236 (CUUUAGA), where the remainder of the read mapped to the start of the N gene. 237\n\nThis indicates that, contrary to previous reports, low levels of discontinuous RNA 238 synthesis are used during production of the N gene negative-strand RNA. The final 239 chimaera which included the 6 nt leader was represented by three reads. These 240 reads included 44 -46 nt of the 5' UTR (i.e., significantly more than the predicted 241 leader-TRS) followed by a sequence mapping to position 19987-19989 which is 242 within ORF1b. 243 A substantial number of additional chimaeric reads were identified, indicative of 244 non-TRS-driven cases of discontinuous RNA synthesis, although formally it is possible 245 that some of these are template-switching artefacts introduced during library 246 preparation and/or sequencing. Additionally, a large number of reads spanning from 247 the 5' UTR to either within the N protein gene or the 3' UTR were identified. Indeed, 248 the only junction represented by over 1000 reads spanned nucleotides 673 to 27649; 249 similarly the second most commonly identified junction spanned 687 to 27550 (642 250 reads). If chimaeric reads were predominantly a sequencing artefact, the abundance 251 of any particular chimaera would be approximately proportional to the product of 252 .

In 255 contrast, most of the observed chimaeric reads were between N and the 5' UTR. The 256 relative paucity of reads mapping to generic locations in the ORF1ab region also 257 argues against the majority of chimaeras being simply artefactual. The 5' UTR 258 preference may be due to genome circularisation during negative-sense synthesis as 259 has been proposed for coronaviruses (18). Alternatively these may derive from 260 autonomously replicating defective interfering RNAs, rather than multiple 261 independent RNA translocation and reinitiation events. Such defective interfering 262\n\nRNAs have been extensively analysed previously and are a common complication of 263\n\nEToV studies (19). Consistent with the high level of 5'UTR:N chimaeric sequences, 264\n\nthere was high RNA-seq density throughout much of the 5' UTR, with the 3' extent of 265 the region of high density coinciding approximately with the region to which a large 266 number of the chimaeric 5' ends mapped ( Figure 2, Figure 4) . 267\n\ninfection. The RNA-seq data were analysed to identify genes that were differentially 269 expressed between virus-infected and mock-infected ED cells. We identified 61 270 genes that were upregulated in virus-infected cells; amongst which eight gene 271 ontology (GO) terms were overrepresented, mostly related to the nucleosome or 272 immune responses ( Figure 5 ). We found 24 genes that were downregulated in 273 infected cells, amongst which four GO terms were overrepresented, two of which 274 were related to the ribosome. We also analysed differential translational efficiency 275 (based on the RPF to mRNA ratio) between mock-and virus-infected cells. We 276 identified 22 genes that were translated more efficiently in infected cells; GO 277 analysis indicated that these genes tend to encode proteins that are involved in RNA 278 binding. Only two genes were found to be translated less efficiently in infected cells The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/296996 doi: bioRxiv preprint Two additional proteins are translated from 5' CUG-initiated ORFs. Our initial 283 dataset indicated an excess density of ribosomes translating within the +2/-1 frame 284 upstream of ORF1a and overlapping the 5' end of ORF1a ( Figure 2A ). To further 285 investigate this, we repeated the ribosome profiling using infected cells treated with 286 translation inhibitors prior to flash freezing (harringtonine, HAR, and/or 287 cycloheximide, CHX). HAR specifically arrests initiating ribosomes whilst allowing 288 \"run-off\" of elongating ribosomes; conversely CHX stalls elongating ribosomes whilst 289 allowing on-going accumulation at initiation sites. Our quality control analysis 290 confirmed the datasets were of similar quality to our previous experiment 291 ( Supplementary Figures 1, 2 and 4) and mapping of the RPFs provided good coverage 292 of the EToV genome ( Figure 6 ). 293\n\nThis Ribo-seq data confirmed translation of two ORFs located within the so-called 5' 294 UTR and overlapping the 5' end of ORF1a. We have termed these U1 (80 codons) and 295 U2 (258 codon). We predict that translation of both U1 and U2 is initiated from CUG 296 codons, as a close inspection indicated that ribosomes accumulated at these two 297 sites (Figure 7 ). It must be noted that pretreatment with CHX or HAR can introduce 298 artefacts into ribosome profiling data: CHX can lead to an excess of RPF density over 299 ~30 codons following initiation sites when cells are stressed (15, 20) . It has also been 300 suggested that both drugs can promote upstream initiation due to scanning pre-301 initiation complexes stacking behind ribosomes paused at canonical initiation sites 302 (21). However, the distance between the U1 CUG, the U2 CUG and the ORF1a 303 initiation site, besides observation of efficient translation of U2 downstream of the 304\n\nORF1a initiation site makes these artefacts unlikely to be significant confounding 305 factors in the case of U1 and U2. 306\n\nRevisiting our first non-drug-treated dataset, we calculated the RPF densities and 307 translational efficiencies within the U1 and U2 ORFs ( Figure 8 ). U1 has a higher 308 translational efficiency than any of the other ORFs translated from genomic RNA, 309 whereas U2 has a translational efficiency similar to that of ORF1a. 310\n\nTo assess the coding potential of U1, we calculated the ratio of non-synonymous to 311 synonymous substitutions (dN/dS), where dN/dS < 1 indicates selection against non-312 .

Application of codeml (22) to a codon alignment of eight 314 torovirus U1 nucleotide sequences resulted in a dN/dS estimate of 0.31 \u00b1 0.08, 315\n\nindicating that the U1 ORF is likely to encode a functional protein. MLOGD (23) uses 316 a principle similar to the dN/dS statistic but also accounts for conservative amino 317 acid substitutions (i.e. similar physico-chemical properties) being more probable 318 than non-conservative substitutions in biologically functional polypeptides. MLOGD 319 3-frame \"sliding window\" analysis of a full-genome alignment revealed a strong 320 coding signature in the known protein-coding ORFs (as expected) and also in the U1 321 ORF ( Figure 9 ). 322\n\nWe previously predicted the existence of U2 via an analysis of coding potential and 323 synonymous site conservation across the two torovirus genomes available at that 324 time (24). Six additional torovirus genome sequences have now become available. 325\n\nWe therefore extended the bioinformatics analysis using all eight currently available 326 torovirus genome sequences ( Figure 9 ). Since the U2 ORF overlaps ORF1a, leading to 327 constraint on dS, the dN/dS analysis is not appropriate for U2. MLOGD analysis 328 indicated that the U2 ORF has a higher coding potential than the corresponding part 329 of ORF1a ( Figure 9 ). Overlapping genes are thought mainly to evolve through 330 \"overprinting\" of an ancestral gene by the de novo gene (25). The de novo gene 331 product is often an accessory protein and often disordered (26). Interestingly, the 332 fragment of pp1a encoded by the region of ORF1a that is overlapped by U2 has no 333 tblastn (27) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/296996 doi: bioRxiv preprint probability that the observed level of conservation would occur by chance is p = 6.5 x 344 10 \u221240 . 345\n\nBoth U1 and U2 are conserved in all eight torovirus sequences with no variation in 346 length or initiation or termination position (Supplementary Figure 5) . In all 347 sequences, U1 and U2 begin with a CUG codon in a strong initiation context ('A' at -3 348 for U1, and 'A' at -3 and 'G' at +4 for U2) (30). The U1 protein is predicted to contain 349 two central transmembrane domains and has a C-terminus containing many charged 350 amino acids. The U2 protein is predicted to form alternating \u03b1 helix and antiparallel \u03b2 351 sheet domains, however no structural homologs were found through searches of 352 public databases (31-33). Their function(s) will be the topic of future work. Figure 6 ) and it has been suggested previously that the motif 366 definition should be extended to cACN 3-4 CUUUAGA to reflect this (34). It is likely that 367 these flanking nucleotides contribute to the degree of utilisation. 368\n\nFor the S gene, the chimaeric junction occurs within the run of uridines 3'-adjacent 369\n\nto the hairpin ( Figure S6I ). Our results lend support to the hypothesis suggested 370 previously that a short conserved RNA hairpin, 174 nt upstream of the AUG start 371 . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

The 373 predicted hairpin structure was not present in S gene chimaeric reads, indicating that 374 translocation may indeed be prompted by the RdRp encountering a physical block 375 after synthesising the reverse complement of the S ORF. This is in contrast to the 376 coronaviral and arteriviral mechanism, wherein RNA structures are insufficient and 377 an accompanying body TRS is required to act as a transcriptional attenuation signal, 378\n\nprompting translocation and re-pairing of the nascent RNA. We cannot 379 unambiguously identify which nucleotides are templated before or after the 380 translocation event, as a GUUU sequence maps to genomic RNA on either side of the 381\n\nThe leader-TRS chimaeric reads mapping to the N protein gene initially appear 383 consistent with the coronaviral and arteriviral mechanism of TRS-driven 384 discontinuous RNA synthesis. However close inspection indicated that the 385 homologous motif mediating copy-choice recombination-like translocation and re-386 pairing of RNA strands was actually a short AGAA sequence, not the true TRS 387 (tetranucleotides underlined in Figures S6A and S6G ). This would result in the 388 nascent anti-TRS mispairing with the leader TRS; two nucleotides are \"skipped\" once 389 reinitiation occurs. This may explain why the discontinuous mechanism is utilised so 390 rarely for this mRNA. 391\n\nThis leads to the suggestion that homology between any two sites may be sufficient 392 to induce discontinuous RNA synthesis, i.e. that provided adequate sequence 393 homology exists, the nascent RNA strand may re-pair with upstream sites within the 394 genomic RNA regardless of the presence of a predefined TRS. This is consistent with 395 the 5' UTR-ORF1b chimaeric transcripts, which again revealed a particular sequence 396 that could be templated from either region, in this case AACCUUA rather than the 397\n\nIf TRS sequence-specificity is not required to stimulate EToV discontinuous RNA 399 synthesis, it is presumably constrained by alternative roles. The highly conserved The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/296996 doi: bioRxiv preprint genomes (Supplementary Figure 6) suggests it is not tolerant to mutations, however 402 this has not been formally confirmed. Lack of conservation of the EToV U1, ORF1a 403 and ORF1b TRS sequences is consistent with them not being functionally relevant. 404\n\nOur results indicate this essential nature is likely due to a role in transcriptional 405 termination, as we did not identify a significant role of this motif in the generation of 406 chimaeric transcripts. Conversely, the upstream region of the \"extended\" TRS 407 (cACN 3-4 CUUUAGA) is tolerant to modifications, reflecting the variable nature within 408 sequences; even when this spacer is extended to six nucleotides, transcripts are still 409 detectable at 20 % of WT levels (34). Again, this is consistent with a role in 410 termination rather than a requirement for re-pairing with upstream sequences. The 411 canonical TRS sequences also presumably contribute to subgenomic promoter 412 recognition, as the initial CAC is essential though the adenylate is the first nucleotide 413 on all positive-strand subgenomic transcripts (34). Initiation of sgRNA transcription at 414 AC dinucleotides is also found in the roniviruses (10). It may be that in these 415\n\nNidovirales families, the conserved TRS is utilised primarily for signalling 416 transcriptional termination followed by promoter recognition, and any use for 417 discontinuous RNA synthesis is merely a byproduct of RdRp promiscuity. 418\n\nThe unique combination of discontinuous and non-discontinuous mechanisms within 419 the one virus so far appears unique to the mammalian toroviruses. The one 420 bafinivirus isolated to date (white bream virus, family Coronaviridae, subfamily 421\n\nwhich is not conserved with the mammalian toroviruses analysed in this study. 423\n\nBafinivirus replication produces three sgRNAs which share an identical 42-nt leader 424 also found at the far 5' terminus of the genome, indicating this species utilises 425 discontinuous RNA synthesis in a manner similar to the corona-and arteriviruses 426 (35). However there was preliminary evidence that two of the three sgRNAs exhibit 427 diversity in their junction sites, suggesting the anti-TRS may bind to multiple sites 428 within the 5' leader during strand transfer, consistent with our suggestion that whilst 429 a threshold level of homology is required this is not limited to particular primary 430\n\nsequences. This is reflected in the fact that the bafinivirus leader-TRS is not fully 431 identical to the body TRSs. 432 . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

It has 434 been suggested that convergent evolution has resulted in the mechanism for 435 discontinuous negative strand synthesis arising multiple times within the Nidovirales. 436\n\nSimilarly, whether the initial role of the TRS motif was to merely stimulate the 437 attenuation of RNA synthesis or to direct the discontinuous mechanism is not 438 known. Our data suggests that transcription mechanisms in the Nidovirales fall into 439 multiple categories, each requiring a distinct role of the TRS: (i) homology-driven 440 reinitiation (canonical discontinuous RNA synthesis, as seen in coronaviruses and 441 arteriviruses and to a low extent, EToV N protein-coding mRNAs); (ii) structure- The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/296996 doi: bioRxiv preprint preferentially translated in infected cells; these have been previously identified as 464 interaction partners of arteriviral non-structural protein 1\u03b2 and contribute to viral 465 RNA replication (41). It therefore appears that torovirus infection induces a similar 466 host response to many nidovirids. 467\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first analysis of differential gene expression What is the function of U1 and U2? The current lack of a published reverse genetics 478 system to study torovirus replication means we are unable to perform targeted 479 mutagenesis. This would enable definitive experimental confirmation that U1 and U2 480 are translated from their respective CUG codons, followed by phenotypic analysis of 481 knock-out mutants. However the comparative genomic analysis together with the 482 accumulation of ribosomes on both CUG codons is highly suggestive of this being the 483 site of initiation; CUG has previously been reported as the most commonly utilised 484 non-AUG initiation codon in mammalian systems (43). In the case of U1, the coding 485 sequence contains no AUG codons (in any frame), a situation that would facilitate 486 pre-initiation ribosomes to continue scanning to the U2 CUG and the ORF1a AUG 487 initiation sites (44). It remains a possibility that U2 translation initiates at a 488 downstream AUG, however the only in-frame AUG is located 336 nt downstream of 489 our presumed start site and is in a poor initiation context ('C' at \u22123) and 3' of the 490\n\nORF1a AUG. We are therefore confident that the CUG codons that were identified in 491 the ribosome profiling data represent the genuine translational start sites. 492 .

U1 is not under such limitations, although it 496 is likely that the viral genome must maintain specific 5' UTR structures to facilitate 497 viral replication. Previous investigations utilising defective interfering RNAs have 498 confirmed that no more than the first 604 nt of the 5' UTR and the entirety of the 3' 499 UTR are sufficient to allow both positive and minus strand RNA synthesis (34); it is 500 notable that this region only includes one-third of the U1 ORF (which starts at 501 nucleotide 524) and hence only this subdomain would be constrained by maintaining 502 two distinct functional roles. We suggest that the so-called 5' UTR is actually limited 503 to 523 nt preceding the CUG of U1, and the remainder of U1 and U2 is not under 504 pressure to maintain cis-replication elements. 505\n\nNeither ORF could be identified within the white bream virus genome, a bafinivirus 506 that constitutes another genus within the subfamily Torovirinae (35), although the 507 lack of multiple bafinivirus sequences makes comparative genomic analysis 508\n\nThe function(s) of the proteins encoded by both U1 and U2 remain to be elucidated. 510\n\nDespite the relatively large size of the U2 protein (~30 kDa), after extensive database 511 searches no structural homologs were identified. By comparison, the U1 protein is 512 small (~10 kDa), highly basic (pI = 10.4) and possesses many of the predicted features 513 of a double-spanning transmembrane protein, including two hydrophobic stretches 514 separated by a 'hinge' and a predicted coiled-coil tertiary topology. Based on 515 structural similarity to known proteins, one potential function might be a virally 516 encoded ion channel (viroporin) embedded in either intracellular or plasma 517 membranes. It is possible that U1 plays a similar role in toroviruses to that of the 518 coronaviral and arteriviral E proteins, which have no known toroviral homologue. 519\n\nThe coronavirus E protein is a small transmembrane protein (~10 kDa) which 520 possesses ion channel activity and is required for virion assembly, forming a 521 pentamer that traverses the viral envelope (48). E proteins also possess a 522 . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

An analogous \"N+1\" protein has been identified in 527 some group II coronaviruses and is postulated to play a structural role, however it is 528 not essential for replication (49, 50). Neither our ribosome profiling nor comparative 529 genomic analysis provides evidence that this ORF is utilised in toroviruses. We did 530 not observe ribosomes translating in this frame in either the initial dataset or the 531 drug-treated samples (although Ribo-seq may not always detect poorly translated 532 overlapping genes); further, the ORF is not preserved in all torovirus genomes. 533\n\nOur data has revealed that the transcriptional landscape of a prototypic torovirus is 534 complex and driven by many factors beyond the canonical \"multi-loci TRS\" model of 535\n\ncoronaviruses. The development of a torovirus reverse genetics system would allow 536 manipulation of potential translocation-inducing sequences and allow us to elucidate 537 which features of the toroviral TRS cause them to act as terminators of RNA 538 synthesis, rather than consistently inducing homology-assisted recombination. Our 539 accompanying translational analysis has revealed two conserved novel ORFs, and has 540 shortened the EToV 5' UTR to a mere 523 nt. Together these data provide an insight 541 into the molecular biology of the replication cycle of this neglected pathogen and 542 highlight the disparities between the families of the Nidovirales. 543\n\nVirus isolates. A plaque-purified isolate of equine torovirus, Berne strain (isolate 545 P138/72) (EToV) was kindly provided by Raoul de Groot (Utrecht University) and 546 cultured in equine dermis (ED) cells. This virus was initially isolated from a 547 symptomatic horse in 1972 (13). ED cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified 548\n\nEagle's medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10 % foetal calf serum, 100 IU/mL 549 penicillin, 100 \u00b5g/mL streptomycin, 1 mM non-essential amino acids, 25 mM HEPES 550 and 1 % L-glutamine in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 . 551 .

RNA and ribosomes were harvested according to 558 previously published protocols (15, 51) with minor modifications. Following either 559 RPF or RNA isolation, duplex-specific nuclease was not utilised but instead rRNA was 560 depleted with the RiboZero [human/mouse/rat] kit (Illumina). Libraries were 561 prepared and sequenced using the NextSeq500 platform (Illumina). were then mapped sequentially to the rRNA, vRNA, mRNA and ncRNA databases 580 using bowtie version 1.2.1.1 (56), with parameters -v 2 --best (i.e. maximum 2 581 mismatches, report best match), with only unmapped reads passed to each following 582 .

Reads that did not align to any of the aforementioned databases were then 583 mapped to the host gDNA using STAR version 2.5.4a (57), again allowing a maximum 584 of 2 mismatches per alignment. Remaining reads were classified as unmapped. 585\n\nRibo-seq density and RNA-seq density were calculated for each gene in the EToV 586 genome (Figure 3, Figure 8) . To normalise for different library sizes, reads per million 587 mapped reads (RPM) values were calculated using the sum of positive-sense virus 588 RNA reads and host RefSeq mRNA reads as the denominator. In order to standardise 589 the regions used to calculate RNA-seq and Ribo-seq density, the following regions were calculated as the number of reads per million mapped reads for which the 5' 605 end maps to each region, divided by the length of the region in nt, multiplied by 606 1000 (i.e. RPKM). For RNA-seq, a decumulation strategy was used to subtract the 607 estimated RNA-seq density for longer overlapping genomic and subgenomic 608 transcripts that would contribute to the RNA-seq density measured for each of the 3' 609\n\nORFs: the genomic RNA-seq density was subtracted from all subgenomic densities, 610 and then the RNA-seq densities of overlapping \"upstream\" subgenomic transcripts 611 were iteratively subtracted from \"downstream\" regions (e.g. RNA-seq density in the 612 unique region of M was subtracted from HE, and this was subtracted from N). 613 Chimaeric reads were classified as reads for which the entire read mapped uniquely 639\n\nto the viral genome, with no mismatches, after adding a single breakpoint, with a 640 minimum of 12 nt mapping on either side of the breakpoint, at least 5 nt apart. To 641 identify such reads, all unmapped reads were split into two sub-reads at every 642 possible position \u226512 nt from either end and these sub-reads were mapped to the 643 .

At some positions single nucleotide 647 resolution for the chimaeric break-point could not be established; where reads were 648 found to break at adjacent possible positions these positions were merged to give a 649 short region containing the breakpoint. The number of non-chimaeric reads spanning 650 each donor and acceptor site was calculated as the number of reads which 651 overlapped the site by at least 12 nt in either direction (as chimaeric reads 652 overlapping the site by < 12 nt are not detectable). The proportion of chimaeric 653 reads at each \"donor\" or \"acceptor\" site is therefore the number of chimaeric reads 654 with a breakpoint at the site divided by this number plus the number of non-655 chimaeric reads spanning the site ( Figure 4B ). 656\n\nTo visualise TRS conservation, multiple sequence alignments were generated using 657\n\nClustal Omega with default parameters (60). RNA structure was predicted using RNA-658 Alifold (61) and visualised using VARNA (62). 659\n\nDifferential gene expression analysis. For analysis of host differential expression 660 between non-drug treated infected and mock-infected cells, all reads which did not 661 map to rRNA or vRNA were mapped to the EquCab2.0 reference genome and 662 annotations (Ensembl release 89) using STAR (57) with a maximum of two 663 mismatches and removal of non-canonical, non-annotated splice junctions. Read 664 counts were generated using HTSeq 0.8.0 (63). For differential transcription analysis, 665 gene level counts were generated across the Ensembl release 89 EquCab2.0 gtf file, 666 filtered to include only protein-coding genes. For differential translation efficiency 667 analysis only coding regions (CDS) were considered: both RNA-seq and Ribo-seq 668 counts were generated at CDS level using intersection-strict mode, based on the 669 same annotation set. Multimapping reads were excluded from both analyses. 670\n\nDifferential transcript abundance analysis was performed using the standard DESeq2 671 (64) pipeline described in the vignette. Genes to which <10 reads mapped were 672 discarded and shrinkage of log 2 fold changes for lowly expressed genes was 673 . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

All recommended quality control 674 plots were inspected, and no major biases were identified in the data. False 675 discovery rate (FDR) values were calculated using the R fdrtool package (65). Genes 676 with a log 2 fold change >1 and an FDR less than 0.1 were considered to be 677 differentially expressed. Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis (66) was 678 performed against a background of all horse protein-coding genes in the Ensembl gtf 679 using a Fisher Exact Test and corrected for multiple testing with a Bonferroni 680 correction. GO annotations for horse genes were downloaded from BiomaRt 681 (Ensembl release 90) (67). Differential translational efficiency analysis was carried 682 out using the CDS counts table, normalised using the DESeq2 \"sizeFactors\" 683 technique. Similar to the differential transcription analysis, genes to which <10 reads 684 mapped were discarded. Again all recommended quality control plots for DESeq2 685 were inspected and no major biases were identified in the data. Differential 686 translation efficiency analysis was performed using Xtail (68), following the standard 687 pipeline described in the vignette. P-values were adjusted automatically within Xtail 688 using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Genes with a log 2 fold change >1 and an 689 adjusted p-value less than 0.1 were considered to be differentially translated. GO 690 enrichment analysis was performed as described for the differential transcript 691 abundance analysis.

The standard deviation for the 705 codeml dN/dS value was estimated via a bootstrapping procedure, in which codon 706 columns of the alignment were randomly resampled (with replacement); 100 707 randomized alignments were generated, and their dN/dS values calculated with 708\n\nCoding potential within each reading frame was analysed using MLOGD (23) and 710 synonymous site conservation was analysed with synplot2 (29). For these analyses 711\n\nwe generated a codon-respecting alignment of the eight torovirus full-genome 712 sequences using a procedure described previously (29). In brief, each individual 713 genome sequence was aligned to a reference sequence using code2aln version 1.2 714 (73). Breda virus (GenBank accession AY427798) was used as reference, since unlike 715\n\nBerne virus it contains an intact HE gene. Genomes were then mapped to reference 716 sequence coordinates by removing alignment positions that contained a gap 717 character in the reference sequence, and these pairwise alignments were combined 718 to give the multiple sequence alignment. This was analysed with MLOGD using a 40-719 codon sliding window and a 5-codon step size. For each of the three reading frames, 720 within each window the null model is that the sequence is non-coding whereas the 721 alternative model is that the sequence is coding in the given reading frame. 722\n\nPositive/negative values indicate that the sequences in the alignment are 723 likely/unlikely to be coding in the given reading frame. To assess conservation at 724 synonymous sites, the concatenated coding regions were extracted from the 725 alignment and analysed with synplot2. 726\n\nThe sequencing data reported in this paper have been deposited in ArrayExpress 728 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/296996 doi: bioRxiv preprint The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/296996 doi: bioRxiv preprint Figure 9 .
