{"title": "DNA breaks-mediated cost reveals RNase HI as a new target for selectively eliminating antibiotic resistance", "body": "Introduction different mechanistic basis but affecting the same process (transcription-translation coupling) also cause DNA breaks.\n\nWe then hypothesized that, if DNA breaks are key contributors to the fitness cost of resistance, compensatory evolution of resistant strains should result in a reduction of DNA breaks. To test this, we compared the cost and SOS induction in the RpsL K43T RpoB H526Y double mutant and in an isogenic strain additionally carrying the most prevalent compensatory mutation found in our previous study:\n\nRpoC Q1126K (40) . As hypothesized, both cost and SOS induction are greatly reduced in the compensated strain (Figure 2A ), confirming that DNA breaks are targeted by compensatory evolution. In order to test if this is general, we analyzed nine compensated clones from three independent populations of the RpsL K43T RpoB H526Y double mutant propagated for fifteen days in the absence of antibiotics. As expected, the costs are smaller in the evolved strains and, as hypothesized, all the nine compensated clones show decreased SOS induction compared to their resistant ancestor ( Figure 2B ). This demonstrates that compensatory evolution widely targets mechanisms that reduce DNA breaks and further reinforces the notion that DNA breaks are major contributors to the cost of antibiotic resistance.\n\nIncreasing transcription-coupled DNA repair reduces the cost of resistance\n\nWe then hypothesized that, if DNA breaks contribute to the cost of resistance, enhancing DNA repair should reduce the cost. The RNA polymerase-binding transcription factor DksA has been recently shown to be involved in the transcription-coupled repair of DNA breaks (53, 54) . Thus, we hypothesize that overexpression of dksA should decrease the cost of resistance. As hypothesized, overproduction of DksA increases the fitness of the double resistant RpsL K43N RpoB H526Y , but not that of sensitive bacteria ( Figure S2A ), indicating that the relationship between DNA breaks and the fitness cost of antibiotic resistance is, indeed, causal.\n\nReplication speed affects the cost of resistance Transcription-translation uncoupling can involve increased generation of replicationtranscription conflicts, which ultimately generate DNA breaks (42, 55) . Replication-transcription conflicts are maximized during fast replication, and less pronounced when bacteria grow slowly (56) .\n\nConsequently, we hypothesized that the cost of resistance should be expressed mostly when cells are rapidly dividing. Indeed, we observed that, although the costs of Rif R and Str R mutations are similar at 4h and 24h, these costs are generated in the first 4 hours (which comprise exponential growth), while resistance mutations show no cost afterwards, when growth slows down ( Figure 3A ). We therefore hypothesize that altering replication-transcription conflicts should affect the fitness cost of resistance.\n\nTo test that hypothesis, we influenced the occurrence of replication-transcription conflitcs through two strategies: negatively by growing our set of mutants in minimal medium, where DNA replication is slower (57) , or positively it by overexpressing the DNA replication initiator protein DnaA, which causes simultaneous initiation of multiple replication forks (58) . Our hypothesis predicts that DNA breaks should be reduced in minimal medium, where replication-transcription conflicts are less pronounced ( Figure 3B ). In agreement with our hypothesis, the SOS induction is smaller in minimal than in rich media ( Figure 3C , right panel), and the correlation with the cost is much weaker in minimal medium ( Figure S2B ). Coherently, the number of resistant mutants showing a fitness cost is smaller in minimal medium (8, compared to 13 in rich medium), with four of them even showing a higher fitness than sensitive bacteria ( Figure 3C , left panel). Moreover, some of the most costly mutations in rich medium (e. g. RpsL K43N RpoB H526Y and RpsL K43T RpoB H526Y ) generate a much smaller cost in minimal medium (compare Figure 1A with Figure 3C ). Besides this general trend, however, there are resistant mutants (notably, those carrying the allele RpoB S531F ) that conserve or even increase their fitness cost in minimal medium (compare Figure 1A with Figure 3C ), evidencing the existence of additional factors contributing to the cost of resistance (such as the known defects in protein synthesis). Conversely, our hypothesis also anticipates that increasing the occurrence of replication-transcription conflicts by overexpressing DnaA should particularly affect resistant bacteria. As hypothesized, overexpression of dnaA severely compromises the viability of double resistant bacteria, whereas sensitive bacteria remains largely unaffected ( Figure 3D ). Altogether, these results demonstrate the involvement of replication-transcription conflicts in the generation of the cost of antibiotic resistance, also corroborating the key contribution of DNA breaks to it.\n\nBoth transcription-translation uncoupling and replication-transcription conflicts lead to increased formation of R-loops, which cause DNA breaks (42,59) and exacerbate replicationtranscription conflicts themselves by impairing replication fork progression (60) . We thus reasoned that depleting RNase HI function, which specifically degrades R-loops (61), should lead to increased DNA breaks and greater costs of Rif R and Str R . Accordingly, both DNA breaks and the cost of resistance are greatly exacerbated in the \u0394rnhA background ( Figure 4A , Table 1 , Figure S3 , Figure S4A ). Conversely, mild overproduction of RNase HI can ameliorate both phenotypes in a subset of mutants ( Figure S5 ); however, strong overproduction is toxic for the cell (62, 63) , irrespective of its genotype ( Figure S6 ).\n\nThese results confirm the involvement of R-loops in the uncoupling-mediated production of DNA breaks caused by resistance and suggest that RNase HI can be a target for manipulating the fitness of resistant strains in bacterial populations.\n\nRNase HI can serve as a target specific against resistant bacteria The large effect of lacking RNAse HI function on the fitness of resistant bacteria prompted us to ask whether targeting it could be used to select specifically against resistant bacteria in polymorphic populations. RNase HI inhibitors are currently studied as antiretrovirals (64) . A commercially available one, RHI001, has been shown to inhibit the activity of purified E. coli RNase HI protein in vitro (65) .\n\nIn competitions between sensitive and resistant bacteria, we observed that addition of RHI001 to the medium increases the cost of most resistant mutants ( Figure 4B ), on average by 14%. RHI001 also reduces fitness of double resistant bacteria more than that of sensitive bacteria in the absence of competition ( Figure S4B and S4C). Chemical inhibition was not as effective as genetic removal (which increases cost on average by 28%) ( Figure 4C and D), as may be expected, since stability, diffusibility across the bacterial envelope, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of RHI001 in vivo are unknown, and potentially suboptimal. Nevertheless, these results suggest that inhibiting RNase HI may be a plausible strategy to select specifically against resistant strains coexisting with sensitive bacteria, as long as resistant strains fail to evolve adaptations that abrogate their extinction. In order to test this hypothesis, we propagated a mixture of sensitive bacteria (CFP-labeled) competing against a pool of five single resistant mutants (YFP-labeled RpsL K43N , RpsL K43T , RpoB H526L , RpoB H526Y , and RpoB S531F ) during 15 days, in the absence of antibiotics. We studied the frequency dynamics of resistant clones under both strong bottlenecks (1:1500 dilutions), where new adaptive mutations are less likely to spread, and weak bottlenecks (1:50 dilutions), where propagation of adapted clones is more probable.\n\nIn parallel, we performed identical propagations, but in which all strains lack RNase HI, as a proxy for optimal inhibition of RNase HI function. We observed that, in the presence of RNase HI, sensitive bacteria initially outcompete resistant clones but, as the propagation progresses, resistant bacteria increase in frequency -likely due to compensatory evolution -finally reaching coexistence ( Figure 5A Figure 5B ). Since the outcome of competitions under laboratory conditions can differ from those within the host (4,66), we next tested if inhibition of RNase HI would be an effective strategy in an animal model. We used the well-established mouse gut colonization model, which resembles the natural environment of many bacterial pathogens, including E. coli (67) . We colonized by oral gavage two cohorts of mice (each n=6): one with a 1:9 ratio mixture of CFP-tagged sensitive bacteria and a YFP-labeled double resistant strain [RpsL K43T RpoB H526Y , selected based on its ability to efficiently colonize the mammalian gut (68) ], and the other with an identical mixture but in which both strains are \u0394rnhA. We then followed the frequency and absolute numbers [Colony Forming Units (CFUs) per gram of feces] of the resistant strain over time. Remarkably, when RNase HI function is intact, the double resistant strain persists in the gut of all animals at frequencies between 2.3 and 9.3% ( Figure 5C , blue lines) and high bacterial loads ( Figure 5D , blue lines) two weeks after gavage but, in the absence of RNase HI, resistant clones are rapidly outcompeted by sensitive bacteria ( Figure 5C and D, red lines). Indeed, resistant bacteria are driven to extremely low frequencies in as soon as 1 day postcolonization, and their extinction occurs in all the six mice in as soon as 5 days ( Figure 5C and D, red lines), demonstrating that RNase HI is a new target for efficiently eliminating resistant strains in the gut. Surprisingly, the absence of RNase HI does not lead to any detectable fitness defect in the sensitive bacteria, as the loads of E. coli are similar in the two cohorts of mice ( Figure 5E ). We then queried if the sequential application of an RNase HI inhibitor followed by an antibiotic could successfully eliminate the entire population of a potential gut pathogenic species composed of sensitive and resistant strains. In this scenario, we hypothesize that an antibiotic treatment should render completely different outcomes depending on the presence of RNase HI function. Indeed, a week-long treatment of streptomycin starting at day 16 after gavage enables resistant clones with intact RNase HI function to rebound and reach high loads (10 7 -10 8 CFUs/g feces), but it completely erradicates \u0394rnhA bacteria in all the six mice ( Figure 5F ). These results demonstrate that RNAse HI function is not only a key determinant of the fitness of resistant bacteria, but also a potential co-adjuvant to eliminate undesirable bacteria in a natural environment for bacterial pathogens such as the mammalian gut. Altogether, these results show the enormous potential of targeting RNase HI as a promising antimicrobial therapy.\n\nWe show that mutations affecting transcription and translation generate DNA breaks, which explain 73% of the variation in their cost ( Figure 1 , Table 1 , Figure S1 ). Compensatory evolution indicates that these resistances cause uncoupling between transcription and translation (40) , which can result in DNA breaks (42). Indeed, we show that the RpsL K43N RpoB H526Y and RpsL K43T RpoB H526Y double mutants, which combine alleles that cause increased transcription elongation rate (12) and decreased translation rate (26, 69) , show the highest costs and DNA breaks ( Figure 1 ). Curiously, inhibition of translation has been shown to alleviate the cost of Rif R mutations in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (36) . In light of the results presented here, this observation is compatible with a scenario in which Rif R mutations cause a perturbation of transcription-translation coupling by virtue of reduced RNA polymerase processivity, and translation inhibitors promote re-coupling by decreasing ribosomal activity. In agreement with the notion of single resistance mutations causing significant uncoupling, single Rif R or Str R mutations with high cost (70) cause a strong induction of the SOS response ( Figure   S7 ). We also showed that RNase HI is a key determinant of the fitness of resistant mutants ( Figure 4 , Table 1 , Figure S3 , Figure S4A , Figure S5 , Figure The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/756767 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nWe observed that replication-transcription conflicts contribute to the cost of resistance ( Figure   3 ), and that overproduction of DksA, involved in transcription-coupled DNA repair (53, 54) , reduces the cost of resistance ( Figure S2A ). Interestingly, DksA is also involved in preventing replicationtranscription conflicts (73) . Thus, prevention of the conflicts by DksA might also account for its beneficial effect on resistant bacteria, besides the enhancement of DNA repair. The involvement of replication-transcription conflicts in the cost of resistance is coherent with previous observations, such as the small cost of specific Rif R and/or Str R alleles in minimal medium (24, 74, 75) or the outcompetition of sensitive bacteria by resistant mutants in aging colonies (76, 77) . Interestingly, stable DNA replication (initiation of DNA replication at sites different from OriC) can be induced by lack of RNase HI or by conditions that activate SOS (78) . Thus, Rif R and Str R mutations, which induce SOS This detrimental runaway loop, as well as the effects of the environment on the cost described above ( Figure 1A and Figure 3C ), could potentially be exploited therapeutically, via concurrent chemical and dietary treatments designed to synergistically maximize the cost of resistance.\n\nWe revealed RNase HI as a promising target specific against resistant bacteria (Figure 4 ), and showed that lack of RNase HI function favors extinction of resistant clones, preventing compensatory evolution ( Figure 5A The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/756767 doi: bioRxiv preprint mutations (80) or for pathogens that acquire antibiotic resistance exclusively through mutation, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which often carries Rif R and Str R mutations (81) . Interestingly, RNase HI has been proposed as an antimycobacterial target due to its essentiality in Mycobacterium smegmatis (82, 83) . The results presented here strongly support the plausibility of this strategy.\n\nAn understanding of the determinants of maintenance and dissemination of antibiotic resistance, such as its cost, is urgently needed (1). We show that DNA breaks are key contributors to the cost of resistance and reveal RNase HI as a promising antimicrobial target specific against resistant bacteria, which we validated under laboratory conditions, in the mammalian gut, and by using a repurposed drug. Overall, our results uncover important effects of resistances on bacterial physiology and demonstrate the plausibility of exploiting these effects to develop novel strategies against antibiotic resistance.\n\nBacterial strains, media and growth conditions All the strains used in this study (Data S1) derive from strains RB266, RB323 or RB324, which are derivatives of E. coli K12 MG1655 (84) .

The fluorescent constructions were generated by Lambda-Red recombineering (86) (87) (88) , followed by transference to a clean background by P1 transduction (89) , and subsequent transduction of the resistance alleles. The clean deletion of rnhA was constructed by markerless recombineering using a tetR-Ptet-ccdB-cat selection/counterselection cassette as described by Figueroa \n\nFifteen independent colonies of sensitive bacteria were separately inoculated in LB in a 96-well plate, incubated at 37\u00b0C with shaking (700 r.p.m) for 7 hours, and 0.1ml of either independent culture was plated onto a LB agar plate supplemented with 150 \u00b5g/ml erythromycin, and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 5 days (Erm R strains grow in the presence of erythromycin, albeit slowly). Colonies able to grow in these plates were streaked onto plates supplemented with 150 \u00b5g/ml erythromycin, in order to further assess their bona fide resistance, and the rplD, and rplV genes of the resistant clones were amplified by PCR and analyzed by Sanger sequencing.\n\nEarly exponential cultures were diluted into pre-warmed medium containing the inducer of the Gam-GFP construction (anhydrotetracycline, 25 ng/ml) and incubated at 37\u00b0C with shaking (240 r.p.m.) for 3h, prior to imaging. Bacterial solutions were then placed onto 1% agarose (in 1X PBS) pads mounted in adhesive frames between the microscope slide and a coverglass. Images were acquired on an Applied Precision DeltavisionCORE system, mounted on an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope, coupled to a Cascade II 1024x1024 EM-CCD camera, using an Olympus 100x 1.4NA Uplan SAPO Oil immersion objective, where GFP and mCherry were imaged with FITC (Ex: 475/28, EM: 528/38) and TRITC (Ex: 542/28, Em: 617/73) fluorescence filter sets, respectively, and DIC optics. Images were deconvoluted with Applied Precision's softWorx software, and prepared for presentation (cropping smaller fields to facilitate visualization, and false-coloring green and red fluorescent signals) using Fiji/ImageJ. All microscopy experiments were performed at the Imaging Facility of the IGC.\n\nSensitive and RpsL K43N RpoB H526Y strains carrying the expression vector pCA24N -gfp, either empty or carrying the dnaA gene (93) were streaked individually onto LB agar plates supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic (to select for the presence of the plasmid), and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. The next day, three independent colonies from each strain were inoculated separately in LB broth supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic (150 \u00b5l per well) in a 96-well plate and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C with shaking (700 r.p.m). The next day, the OD600 of the overnight cultures was measured using a Thermo Scientific Multiskan Go spectrophotometer, bacteria were appropriately diluted in 1X PBS to generate solutions containing approximately 10 10 , 10 9 , 10 8 , 10 7 , 10 6 , 10 5 Error bars represent mean \u00b1 standard deviation of independent biological replicates (n\u22655).
