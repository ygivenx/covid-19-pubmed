Whilst the majority of effort is aimed at infection, there is also need for clinical research on how to best manage seriously ill patients with COVID-19 [1] . Current available therapies -including non-specific anti-virals, antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections and sepsis, and corticosteroids to reduce inflammation -fail in severe disease where the hallmark is the cytokine storm induced by COVID-19 in the lung, visible as inflammatory lesions with ground-glass opacity on CT scan. Virally-triggered acute cytokine release of IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A and TNF\uf061 induces pulmonary oedema, dysfunction of air-exchange, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac injury, and often secondary infection, leading to death.\n\nThe Lancet has recently published the first comprehensive clinical data on risk factors for COVID-19 mortality, with detailed clinical course of illness including viral shedding that may continue in survivors up to 37 days [2] . In-hospital death is associated with age and notably IL-6 is a significant correlate. For COVID-19, the case fatality rate (CFR) remains unknown until the number infected is determined, but WHO estimates 0.3-1%, which is higher than 0.1% for influenza A. The accruing epidemiological analyses, linked with country-based mitigation strategies, and with estimates that about 80% COVID-19 patients have mild or asymptomatic disease, 14% severe disease, and 6% critically ill, underpin a continuing need for treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia in the long term.\n\nTwo recent studies from China [3, 4] have asked, can mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) treat COVID-19 pneumonia, based on known immunomodulatory and reparative properties of stem cells? Both studies reveal remarkable reversal of symptoms even in severe-critical conditions. Accordingly, these clinical studies not only identify a novel therapeutic strategy, but also the existence of natural mechanisms able to counteract acute inflammatory pneumonia.\n\nOne study is a case report of a critically ill COVID-19 patient on a ventilator who had progressed despite intensive therapy, with markers showing evidence of liver injury. This J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f patient was treated with allogeneic human umbilical cord MSC (hUCMSC) using three intravenous infusions of 5\uf0b410 7 hUCMSC, three days apart. Within four days of her first cell infusion, the patient was off the ventilator and able to walk. All measured parameters, including circulating T cell counts, returned towards normal levelslymphocytes previously being low presumably due to sequestration within the inflamed lungs and tissues. No obvious side effects were observed [3] .\n\nThe second study [4] was a pilot clinical trial to assess whether MSC transplantation could Considering needs for mitigation of the current COVID-19 pandemic, with priority to keep mortality as low as possible, the finding that MSC are safe and can reverse severe critical disease with high potency is a major breakthrough representing an entirely new biological approach to treatment that needs to be developed urgently. To this end, stem cell biotech companies are joining forces (e.g., Athersys and Mesoblast) [8], whilst the nanotechnologybased synthetic stem cell LIFNano is ready for cGMP production at scale today [7] ."}
