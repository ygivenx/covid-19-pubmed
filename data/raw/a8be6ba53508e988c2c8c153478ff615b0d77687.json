{"title": "Modulation of metabolic functions through Cas13d-mediated gene knockdown in liver", "body": "Targeted inhibition of a metabolism regulatory gene is often used for modeling and developing therapies of metabolic diseases (Moller, 2012; Saviano and Baumert, 2019) . In the past decades, many strategies of metabolic regulations were achieved through using various modulators, including numerous small molecular compounds, nucleic acids, and therapeutic polypeptides/proteins targeting individual or multiple defined molecular products, such as enzymes, circulating proteins, cell-surface receptors and cellular RNAs (Moller, 2012) . Applications of metabolic modulation have great potential for disease modeling and therapies. However, developing novel approaches with more specific and more flexible modulation of metabolic genes in vivo is still challenging, because natural and synthesized modulators with high targeting specificity are theoretically limited.\n\nIn recent years, an increasing number of genetic modification tools has emerged.

However, permanent modification of DNA is usually not an optimal strategy for the therapies of acquired metabolic disorders.\n\nRecent breakthroughs with RNA-guided RNA-targeting systems, such as class 2 type VI CRISPR-Cas effectors, were reported for the remarkable capability of RNA editing without permanent modification of DNA. Theoretically, RNA-targeting systems could provide a much safer approach for gene silencing (Abudayyeh et al., 2017; Cox et al., 2017; Konermann et al., 2018; Pineda et al., 2019) . Among such systems, CasRx was recently found to be advantageous, mostly because it is more efficient and has more robust activation during RNA-guided RNA cleavage in mammalian cells in vitro (Konermann et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2018) . CasRx is a type VI-D effector (Cas13d) with a small size that can be packaged into AAVs, and thus has great potential for translational medicine (Konermann et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018) . In this study, we set out to explore the feasibility of using the CasRx system for the targeted silencing of metabolic genes.\n\nauthor/funder. All rights reserved.

CasRx and each Pten sgRNA were introduced through plasmids transfection into mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) cells (Fig. S2A ). After 48 hours, the N2a cells with the transfected CasRx and each Pten sgRNA were analyzed to evaluate their levels of Pten mRNA. As expected, all of our designed Pten sgRNAs revealed successful down-regulation of the level of Pten mRNA (Fig. S2A ).\n\nNext, improvement of knockdown efficiency was tested on the strategy to combine the different Pten sgRNA individuals (Fig. S2B , C, D). After sgPten-5 and sgPten-6 were combined in treatment, the reduction of Pten mRNA levels successfully reached 16\u00b13%, the most efficient of all combinations (Fig. 1A, B and Fig. S2D ). Previously, Pten was known as a metabolic regulator that suppressed the insulin signaling by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway (Cho et al., 2001; Stiles et al., 2004) . Deletion of Pten promoted AKT phosphorylation (Stiles et al., 2004) . Accordingly, such effects were also shown in our results after the successful knockdown of Pten through the combination of sgPten-5 and sgPten-6. In the N2a cells that were transfected with CasRx, sgPten-5 and sgPten-6, the PTEN protein levels were significanty decreased while the AKT phosphorylation levels were significantly elevated (Fig. 1C ). author/funder.

The CasRx system has, however, been reported to be with significantly reduced off-target events compared to other RNAi approaches (Konermann et al., 2018) . Here, we set out to compare the CasRx system with spacer sequence-match shRNAs in knockdown of Pten via transient transfection in N2a cells. Consistent with previous studies, Pten-targeting shRNAs rendered wide-spread off-target transcript changes (Fig. 1D ). In contrast, transfection of the spacer-matched CasRx system induced significantly reduced transcript changes (Fig. 1D) . Importantly, Pten was the most significantly changed gene (Fig. 1D ). These results further validated the high specificity of CasRx-mediated transcript interference.\n\nNext, CasRx-mediated knockdown of a targeted gene was broadly studied among metabolism regulatory genes. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a crucial protein of serum LDL cholesterol regulation (Lambert et al., 2012) . Here, a total of 11 candidate sgRNAs were designed and tested, with the goal of targeting the coding region of Pcsk9 (Fig. S1B ). As expected, all Pcsk9 sgRNA candidates showed the effects of robust knockdown of Pcsk9 mRNAs in the 293T cells transfected with each sgRNA for Pcsk9 (Fig. S2E) . Moreover, CasRx-mediated targeted knockdown could also be applied for lncLstr, a liver-enriched lncRNA ( Fig. S1C and S2F ). author/funder. All rights reserved.

The three metabolic genes Pten, Pcsk9\n\nand lncLstr, were further studied to determine whether gene knockdown was effective in hepatocytes. At first, the effect of CasRx-mediated Pten gene knockdown in the liver was studied through the evaluation of Pten mRNA levels. CasRx, sgPten-5, and sgPten-6 were delivered to the mouse liver by hydrodynamic tail-vein injection of indicated plasmids (Fig. S3A ).\n\nHydrodynamic tail-vein injection, a simple yet effective method, can be used to deliver naked DNA into hepatocytes of mouse liver in vivo (Kim and Ahituv, 2013) . After 96 hours of plasmid injection, individual hepatocytes were dissociated through liver perfusion. Hepatocytes expressing both GFP and mCherry implied successful vector delivery and were purified through cell sorting. Though not mathematically significant, results suggested that the Pten mRNA level in GFP+/mCherry+ hepatocytes had decreased in comparison with that in GFP-/mCherry-hepatocytes (Fig. S3B) .\n\nSecond, the in vivo CasRx-mediated Pcsk9 gene knockdown in mouse liver was studied.

LncLstr is a liver-enriched lncRNA, which regulates lipid metabolism by inhibition of Cyp8b1 (Li et al., 2015) . Similar with the above methods for in vivo vector deliveries, hydrodynamic injection of plasmids encoding CasRx and those encoding both sglncLstr-5 and sglncLstr-6 were performed (Fig. S3A ). Hepatocytes that received these two plasmids showed significant reduction of lncLstr (Fig. S3E ).\n\nCasRx-mediated lncLstr knockdown was sufficient to result in reduced expression of Cyp8b1 (Fig. S3F ). Thus, efficient knockdown of lncRNA was successfully obtained in hepatocytes using the CasRx system.\n\nIn an effort to explore the feasibility of using the CasRx system in simultaneous knockdown of multiple genes, we cloned a vector encoding CasRx and GFP together with 6 sgRNAs targeting Pten, Pcsk9 and lncLstr ( Fig. S3G) . Hydrodynamic tail-vein injection of this plasmid into the liver simultaneously decreased all three targeted genes, providing a powerful platform for simultaneous knockdown of multiple metabolic genes (Fig. S3G) .\n\nTo evaluate the functional modulation of metabolic genes by CasRx, we author/funder.

Importantly, GFP+ hepatocytes were also negative or low for PTEN staining (Fig. 1F) . We also observed increased AKT phosphorylation in hepatocytes receiving the CasRx plasmids, suggesting a functional knockdown of Pten in these cells (Fig.   1F ). To further characterize the hepatocytes receiving CasRx plasmids, we isolated GFP+ hepatocytes by FACS sorting. The GFP+ hepatocytes showed significantly reduced expression of Pten and increased AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 1G, H) .\n\nTo explore the functional activation of AKT signaling cascades, we investigated the response of lipid and glucose metabolism-related genes downstream of AKT. The results showed that Pten knockdown significantly increased the expressions of Fasn (fatty acid synthase) and Srebp1 (sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1) in the GFP+ hepatocytes (Fig. 1I) , which was consistent with previous findings (Stiles et al., 2004) . Pten-inhibited PI3K/AKT signaling was found to be critical for lipogenesis regulation in the liver, while the activated AKT repressed SREBP1, a key transcription factor required for the expression of Fasn (Haeusler et al., 2014; He et al., 2010) .\n\nTherefore, decrease of PTEN promoted the expression of Fasn and Srebp1 author/funder.

Together, the above results indicated that the CasRx system could be used to functionally knock down Pten in vivo.\n\nNext, AAV8, an efficient liver-targeted gene delivery system, was applied to further increase the effect of in vivo Pcsk9 knockdown ( Fig. 2A ) (Shen et al., 2007) . PCSK9 is secreted by hepatocytes, and has great promise as a candidate of drug targets among all regulators of serum cholesterol (Steinberg and Witztum, 2009) . Accumulating evidence shows that inhibition of PCSK9 lowered serum cholesterol levels (Chan et al., 2009; Rossidis et al., 2018 ).\n\nIncreased plasma LDL cholesterol level is one of the major causes for coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), as well as many other diseases (LaRosa et al., 1990; Law et al., 1994) . Thus, we chose the CasRx system applied to Pcsk9 gene knockdown in hepatocytes for the purpose of reducing serum cholesterol levels.\n\nWe delivered CasRx, sgPcsk9-5 and sgPcsk9-6 to the liver by AAV8, which significantly reduced Pcsk9 mRNA level ( Fig. 2A, B) .

Serum total cholesterol levels were reduced to 61.6\u00b119.4% of normal levels (p=0.002) (Fig.   2D ). Moreover, the liver function of AAV-injected mice, saline-injected and non-injected mice were similar, and we did not observe obvious liver injuries in these mice (Fig. 2E, F) . Thus, the CasRx system provides an efficient tool targeting Pcsk9 to reduce serum cholesterol in vivo.\n\nTo investigate whether CasRx-mediated gene knockdown is reversible after removal of the CasRx system, we delivered CasRx plasmids expressing GFP, Cre and Pcsk9-targeting sgRNAs to the livers of ROSA-CAG-lsl-tdTomato mice by hydrodynamic injection (Fig. 2G) . CasRx plasmids expressing LacZ-targeting sgRNA were used as controls.\n\nHepatocytes receiving the plasmids could be traced by the expression of red fluorescent protein tdTomato. One day after injection of plasmids, Pcsk9 mRNA levels in hepatocytes receiving CasRx plasmids (tdTomato+) decreased to 16.5\u00b14.9% of those in hepatocytes without plasmids (GFP-/tdTomato-) (Fig. 2H) . Along with the gradual loss of CasRx plasmids in hepatocytes, the Pcsk9 mRNA levels gradually recovered to normal levels 15 days after injection ( Fig. 2H and Fig. S4A ). Importantly, a second-round injection of the plasmids achieved a similar efficiency of Pcsk9 knockdown compared to that in the first-round of plasmids injection (Fig. 2H) . These author/funder.

In this study, we demonstrated that the CasRx system could efficiently target RNA for knockdown in hepatocytes, providing a robust method to inactivate genes in polyploid cells in vivo.\n\nAnother advantage of CasRx is its small size, when considering therapeutic potential (Barrangou and Doudna, 2016; Konermann et al., 2018) .\n\nCurrently, CasRx is the smallest class 2 CRISPR effector available in mammalian cells (Konermann et al., 2018) .
