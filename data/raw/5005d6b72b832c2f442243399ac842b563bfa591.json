This disease affects over one million people worldwide and is very common within the USA (Minden et al., 1993; Pugliatti et al., 2002; O'Connor et al., 2002) . Age, sex, race, geographical latitude, genetics and environmental exposure are risk factors for developin 9 MS. The median age of onset of MS is approximately 24 years of age (Minden et al., 1993) with a female to male ratio of two to one (O'Connor et al., 2002) . The mean age of death of MS patients is 58 years old, compared to the general national average in the USA of 72 years old (Minden et al., 1993) . Within the USA, MS is observed more often in Caucasians compared to African-Americans (Minden et al., 1993) . However, the typical clinical course is more severe within African-Americans who are affected (Pugliatti et al., 2002) . In regard to geographical patterns, a higher incidence of MS occurs when moving either more north or south of the equator, especially in countries with colder climates (Pugliatti et al., 2002) . This latitude effect is also present within the USA as the incidence of MS is highest within the upper Midwest and Northeast compared to the South (Minden et al., 1993) .\n\nFamily studies have shown that genetic factors contribute to MS (Sadovnick, 2002; Herrera and Ebers, 2003;  Measuring Immunity, edited by Michael -C Lotze and Angus W. Thomson ISBN 0-~ 2-455900-X, London Chapter 45 Kenealy et al., 2003; Wilier et al., 2003) . The risk for developing MS within dizygotic twins is the same as for other siblings (3-5 per cent). However, the risk for monozygotic twins is greater than 30 per cent (O'Connor et al., 2002; Wilier et al., 2003) . A greater than 10-fold increased risk of developing MS exists within individuals having certain human leukocyte antigens (HLA) genotypes (O'Connor et al., 2002; Sadovnick, 2002; Herrera and Ebers, 2003; Kenealy et al., 2003) . The major predisposing associated haplotype is HLA-DR2 in cellular typing nomenclature (DR15,DQ6 by serology and DRB5*0101-DQAI*0102-DQBI*0602 by sequence-based terminology) (Haegert and Francis, 1993; Hillert, 1994) . Even though an association between HLA class II DRB1*15 and DRB1*17 alleles and MS has been seen in individuals of northern European and Mediterranean descent, the presence of these haplotypes does not preclude the development of MS (Sadovnick, 2002; Herrera and Ebers, 2003; Kenealy et al., 2003) . Genetic interactions may also occur between certain haplotypes and certain T cell receptors, immunoglobulins and tumor necrosis factors which may lead to an increased chance of developing MS (O'Connor et al., 2002; Alizadeh et al., 2003) .\n\nNot only genetic but also one or more exogenous or environmental factors may influence the development of MS (O'Connor et al., 2002) . Although twin studies have provided strong evidence for genetic factors in the development of MS, the concordance rate for monozygotic twins has never been demonstrated to be greater than 40 per cent (Compston and Ebers, 1990; Sadovnick, 2002; Wilier et al., 2003) . Thus, at least 60 per cent of persons with an identical twin who has MS will not develop the disease.\n\nCertain foods, toxins, psychological stress, anesthesia, surgery and physical trauma have been implicated in the development of MS (O'Connor et al., 2002) . However, no direct causal relationships have been proven to date. Overall, it is believed that both genetic and environmental factors are responsible for the subsequent development of MS within a susceptible individual (O'Connor et al., 2002) . The resulting disability that results from MS leads to a major burden not only to the affected individual but also to the health care system and society (Whetten-Goldstein etal., 1998).\n\nLoss of myelin due to inflammation with limited subsequent remyelination are the two cardinal features of MS (Noseworthy et al., 2000) . Breakdown of the blood-brain barrier is typically observed with early inflammatory changes (Smith et al., 1993) . Immunocytochemical studies of active MS lesions have shown damage to vascular walls with intramural deposition of complement on smooth muscle components as well as protein-rich leakage (Noseworthy et al., 2000) . These abnormalities can occur within hours to days of an acute attack and slowly resolve over subsequent weeks to months (Poser, 1986) .\n\nTypical pathological findings seen in MS are plaques containing inflammatory cells scattered throughout the affected parenchyma and arranged in cuffs around blood vessels (Figure 45.1) . Inflammatory cells that are stimulated during an acute flare include macrophages, lymphocytes, large mononuclear cells and plasma cells (Prineas and Wright, 1978; Tourbah et al., 1993) . In MS macrophages are immunologically active and can stimulate T cells leading to the subsequent production of large quantities of cytokines and inflammatory mediators (Hafler and Weiner, 1995; Hohlfeld et al., 1995; Martin and McFarland, 1995;  O' Connor et al., 2000) . These cytokines can be either proor anti-inflammatory in nature (Hafler and Weiner, 1995) with a T cell either stimulatory or inhibitory depending on surrounding environment factors (Hafler and Weiner, 1995; Hohlfeld, 1997) .\n\nAxonal loss has also shown to be a key factor in the pathogenesis of MS and is responsible for part of the irreversible clinical impairment and disability (O'Connor et al., 2002) . Axonal loss could stem from: 1 direct autoimmune attack against axons 2 a 'bystander injury' due to exposure of axons to immune attack following demyelination 3 degeneration of axons as a result of chronic demyelination 4 primary degeneration of axons, stimulating a secondary inflammatory response (Trapp et al., 1999; Lassmann, 2003) .\n\nThe importance of these potential associated mechanisms remains to be determined.\n\nThe exact etiology of MS remains unknown, but it is believed that this disease most likely results from a viral infection. These organisms can induce disturbances within a previously competent or compromised immune system (Allen and Brankin, 1993; Cook et al., 1995; O'Connor et al., 2002) . MS may either be due to infection by viruses that directly induce neurological dysfunction from the onset or result from reactivation later in life. A number of organisms or their nucleic acids have been observed within the CSF or brain parenchyma of patients with MS (Booss and Kim, 1990; O'Connor et al., 2002) . These organisms include mycoplasma (Cevassut, 1930 ), protozoa (Bequignon, 1956 ), spirochetes (ichelson, 1957 , as well as a number of both DNA and RNA viruses, such as herpes simplex viruses types 1, 2 and 6 (Sanders et al., 1996) , rabies virus (Bychkova, 1964) , parainfluenza virus type I (ter Meulen et al., 1972 ) , coronavirus (Talbot et al., 1996) , canine distemper virus (Rohowsky-Kochan et al., 1995) , measles virus (Haase et al., 1981) , human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (Berger et al., 1989) and human T lymphotrophic virus type I (HTLV-I) (Salmi et al., 1983; Greenberg et al., 1989) . However, none of the above organisms have been successfully isolated from large groups of clinically definite MS patients. Furthermore, within MS patients infected with these organisms, levels did not correlate with disease activity (O'Connor etal., 2002) .\n\nDespite the lack of definitive evidence of a viral source for MS, it is commonly believed that one or more viruses may be responsible for the development of MS within certain genetically susceptible individuals (Allen and Brankin, 1993; Cook et al., 1995) . One hypothesis for the The main side effects of interferons are flu-like symptoms and depression that tend to diminish with time. Periodic laboratory evaluations including liver enzymes, complete white blood cell counts and thyroid function tests should be performed every 3-6 months. All of the interferons are capable of stimulating the production of neutralizing antibodies that can limit the efficacy of these agents (Sorensen et al., 2003) . The risk of antibody formation over 18 months of treatment is highest with Betaseron, intermediate with Rebif and lowest with Avonex (Bertolotto et al., 2003) .\n\nGlatiramer acetate (Copaxone), a daily subcutaneous injectable synthetic polymer, has been shown to have some positive effects in a small double-blind trial of RRMS (Bornstein et al., 1987) . Studies have shown a lower relapse rate and a significant reduction in the number of new T2 lesions compared to placebo. Side effects can include local injection site reactions and transient systemic post-injection reactions such as chest pain, flushing, dyspnea, palpitations and/or anxiety. No laboratory monitoring is necessary and no neutralizing antibodies have been detected.\n\nThere are now a number of medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of RRMS. There are no clear guidelines, nor is there strong evidence for choosing one drug versus another (Galetta et al., 2002) . After making a diagnosis of MS the patient should be started on one of the medications listed above. MS patients should be notified that these therapies primarily slow the disease course but are not a cure. These drugs are typically continued indefinitely unless side effects are Intolerable or the patient begins to fail in terms of response, after which use of another agent can be considered."}
