{"title": "How virus size and attachment parameters affect the temperature sensitivity of virus binding to host cells: Predictions of a thermodynamic model for arboviruses and HIV", "body": "host cell surface receptors (Cr) (protein or sialic acid (SA)). The magnitude of the enthalpy of association changes with temperature according to the change in heat capacity (\u0394C p ) on GP/Cr binding, being little affected for avian influenza virus (AIV) haemagglutinin (HA) binding to SA (\u0394C p = 0 kJ/mol/K) but greatly affected for HIV gp120 binding to CD4 receptor (\u0394C p = -5.0 kJ/mol/K). A thermodynamic model developed here predicts that values of \u0394C p from 0 to ~-2.0 kJ/mol/K have relatively little impact on the temperature sensitivity of the number of mosquito midgut cells with bound arbovirus, while intermediate values of \u0394C p of ~-3.0 kJ/mol/K give a peak binding at a temperature of ~20\u00b0C as observed experimentally for Western equine encephalitis virus. More negative values of \u0394C p greatly decrease arbovirus binding at temperatures below ~20\u00b0C. Thus to promote transmission at low temperatures, arboviruses may benefit from \u0394C p ~ 0 kJ/mol/K as for HA/SA and it is interesting that bluetongue virus binds to SA in midge midguts.\n\nLarge negative values of \u0394C p as for HIV gp120:CD4 diminish binding at 37\u00baC. Of greater importance, however, is the decrease in entropy of the whole virus (\u0394S a_immob ) on its immobilisation on the host cell surface. \u0394S a_immob presents a repulsive force which the enthalpy-driven GP/Cr interactions weakened at higher temperatures struggle to overcome. \u0394S a_immob is more negative (less favourable) for larger diameter viruses which therefore show diminished binding at higher temperatures than smaller viruses. It is proposed that small size phenotype through a less negative \u0394S a_immob is selected for viruses infecting warmer hosts thus explaining the observation that virion volume decreases with increasing host temperature from 0\u00baC to 40\u00b0C in the case of dsDNA viruses.\n\nCompared to arboviruses which also infect warm-blooded vertebrates, HIV is large at 134 nm diameter and thus would have a large negative \u0394S a_immob which would diminish its binding at human body temperature. It is proposed that prior non-specific binding of HIV through attachment 4 factors takes much of the entropy loss for \u0394S a_immob so enhancing subsequent specific gp120:CD4 binding at 37\u00baC. This is consistent with the observation that HIV attachment factors are not essential but augment infection. Antiviral therapies should focus on increasing virion size, for example through binding of zinc oxide nanoparticles to herpes simplex virus, hence making \u0394S a_immob more negative, and thus reducing binding affinity at 37\u00baC.\n\nAbbreviations: AIV, avian influenza virus; BBF, brush border fragments from midgut; BTV, bluetongue virus; C p , heat capacity at constant pressure; \u0394C p , change in heat capacity; Cr, host cell receptor; CD4, host cell receptor for HIV; C total , number of host cells which can bind virus in a given volume of host fluid (midgut or blood); C.V T , number of host cells with bound virus at temperature T; DENV, Dengue virus; E A , activation energy; EBOV, Zaire ebolavirus; EM, electron microscopy; Env, HIV gp120 trimer envelope protein which binds to a single CD4 molecule; F cT , fraction of arthropod midgut cells with bound virus at temperature T; \u0394G a_virus_T , change in Gibbs free energy on association of virus and host cell at temperature T; GP, viral (glyco)protein on virus surface that binds to Cr; HA, haemagglutinin; \u0394H a_receptor_T , change in enthalpy for binding of virus GP to host Cr receptor at a temperature T; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; HSV-2, herpes simplex virus type 2; \u0394H a_virus_T change in enthalpy for binding of virus to host cell at temperature T; K a_virus_T , association constant for binding of virus to host cells at temperature T; K d_receptor_T , dissociation constant for GP from Cr at temperature T; K d_virus , dissociation constant for virus from host cell; M, molar (moles dm -3 ); n, number of GP/Cr contacts made on virus binding to cell; p transmissionT , probability of successful infection of the arthropod salivary glands after oral exposure at temperature T; p completeT , probability, given a virion has bound to the surface of a midgut cell, that that midgut cell becomes infected and that its progeny viruses go on to infect the salivary gland so completing the arthropod infection process within the life time of the arthropod at temperature T; R, ideal gas constant; \u0394S a_receptor_T , change in entropy for binding of virus GP to host Cr receptor; \u0394S a_virus_T change in entropy for binding of virus to host cell at temperature T; \u0394S a_immob , change in entropy on immobilization of whole virus to cell surface; \u0394S a_non_specific , change in entropy on immobilization of virus to cell surface through non-specific binding; \u0394S a_specific , change in entropy on immobilization of virus to cell surface through specific GP/Cr-driven binding; SA, sialic acid; SIV, simian immunodeficiency virus; V free , virus not bound to cells; V total , virus challenge dose in volume of host fluid; WEEV, Western equine encephalitis virus; WNV, West Nile virus; ZnOT, zinc oxide tetrapod.\n\nSome viruses infect hosts over a range of temperatures depending on the host species. Most notable are the arboviruses which may infect the arthropod vector over a range of ambient temperatures from ~15\u00baC to >30\u00baC (Mullens et al. 2004) , and then infect a vertebrate host at temperatures from 37\u00baC up to 44\u00baC in the case of West Nile virus (WNV) in infected American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) (Kinney et al. 2006 ). Birds generally have higher body temperatures than mammals (Brault 2009 ) and the avian influenza virus (AIV) when jumping from birds to humans has to adapt to a temperature drop of 8\u00baC since the temperature in the human upper respiratory tract is ~33\u00b0C compared to ~41\u00b0C in the avian intestinal tract which is the site of replication of avian viruses (De Graaf and Fouchier, 2014) . Bats have higher core body temperatures than primates (up to 42.1\u00b0C for Phyllostomus hastatus which is an omnivorous bat from South America) when flying (O'Shea et al. 2014) . The core body temperature during flight of the insectivorous free-tailed bat (Mops condylurus) which may have been the origin of the 2013/15 severe Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa (Saez et al. 2015) is 40.5\u00b0C \u00b11\u00b0C (O'Shea et al. 2014) . Thus EBOV which infects a range of vertebrate species from bats to primates and deer may have to infect mammalian hosts over a range of temperatures. Similarly Nipah virus on jumping from fruit bats to pigs and humans (Daszak et al. 2013) may experience a small fall in temperature. Furthermore, cross-species transmission of viruses to bats (and other mammals) from invertebrates may occur with more regularity than has been appreciated (Bennett et al. 2018; Leendertz 2016) , and Bennett et al. (2018) have suggested that arthropods may host many \"bat-associated\" viruses that have defied detection in bats themselves (e.g. EBOV). Depending on the ambient temperature, viruses in arthropods would experience a 9 \u00baC to 15\u00baC temperature increase on being ingested by a bat at 41\u00baC (Gale 2017 ) and this could affect the binding affinity of the virus to its host cell depending on the thermodynamics of virus binding as is discussed here. In contrast other viruses only infect related host species, and in effect are maintained at similar temperatures. For example, simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) infect 36 different nonhuman primate species in sub-Saharan Africa and SIVs from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) have crossed species barriers on multiple occasions generating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2 (Sharp et al. 2005) . Thus the main source of temperature variation experienced by SIV and HIV would be the effect of the circadian rhythm and the slight rise in temperature due to infection of the host which gives a range of 36\u00baC to 38\u00baC in the case of Rhesus monkeys (Huitron-Resendiz, 2007) .\n\nViruses bind to host cells through interactions between a virus surface (glyco)protein (GP) and a host cell receptor (Cr). The Cr molecule on the cell surface may be a protein as in the case of HIV (Myszka et al. 2000) , EBOV (Yuan et al. 2015) , Hendra virus (Xu et al., 2012) and MERS-CoV (Lu et al. 2013) or alternatively is a sialic acid (SA) on a glycan as in the case of AIV (De Graaf and Fouchier, 2014; Fei et al. 2015) and arboviruses such as bluetongue virus (BTV) (Zhang et al. 2010 ). The thermodynamics of virus binding in terms of the changes in enthalpy (\u0394H a_receptor_T ) and entropy (\u0394S a_receptor_T ) on the specific interaction of the GP with the Cr receptor at temperature T during binding of virus to the host cell surface has been set out previously (Gale 2018 (Gale , 2019 . The interactions between the HIV GP and its CD4 cellular receptor (Myszka et al. 2000; Dey et al. 2007 ) and between the AIV haemagglutinin (HA) and its \uf0612,3-SA or \uf0612,6-SA receptors are enthalpy driven, i.e. large negative values of \u0394H a_receptor_T overcome unfavourable values of \u0394S a_receptor_T . Also the binding of vesicular stomatitis virus to phospholipid bilayers is enthalpy driven (Carneio et al. 2002) with very large negative values of \u0394H a_receptor_T .\n\nTemperature may impose constraints on viruses' jumping the species barrier through its effect on the binding affinity of GP to Cr. There may also be constraints on the activities of viral replication proteins such as the AIV polymerase which showed a significantly higher activity at 33\u00b0C than 37\u00b0C (Ngai et al. 2013) . Only virus binding is considered here. Thus according to the van't Hoff Isochore, the binding affinity for a virus to its host cell at temperature T as represented by the association constant K a_virus_T would be greatly diminished for enthalpy-driven GP/Cr interactions at 8 higher temperatures compared to lower temperatures depending on the magnitude of \u0394H a_receptor_T (Gale 2019) . Indeed, assuming \u0394H a_receptor_T is constant over the temperature range, the more negative \u0394H a_receptor_T is in magnitude, the weaker the binding at higher temperatures. This presents a paradox if the K a_virus_T falls to less than ~10 14 M -1 in that higher temperatures would greatly diminish infectivity (Gale 2019) .\n\nWhile the values of \u0394H a_receptor_T and \u0394S a_receptor_T may be constant over the biological temperature range for some GP/Cr systems, e.g. AIV haemagglutinin (HA) binding to sialic acid (SA) residues they may change considerably in magnitude over the biologically relevant temperature range particularly for protein:protein systems as in the case of HIV gp120 binding to CD4 (Myszka et al. 2000) (Figure 1 ). The effect of this on K a_virus_T is considered in this work. The change in \u0394H a_receptor_T with temperature is defined by the difference in heat capacities (C p ) of the GP/Cr \"product\" complex and the free GP/free host Cr \"reactants\" and is represented by \u0394C p which is the slope of the lines in Figure 1 and typically ranges from ~0 kJ/mol/K to -5.0 kJ/mol/K depending on the system.\n\nThe previous thermodynamic treatment of virus binding (Gale 2019) identified the entropy change (\u0394S a_immob ) on immobilisation of the whole virus particle on the host cell surface as a key parameter for which there are currently no data. \u0394S a_immob would be expected to be large and negative in magnitude due to the decrease in the absolute entropy on immobilisation of a large molecular entity such as a virion. A recent analysis has shown that virion volume and genome length for dsDNA viruses decrease by about 55-fold as the temperature of occurrence (i.e. host) increases from 0\u00baC to 40\u00b0C (Nifong and Gillooly 2016) . The temperature of occurrence in these dsDNA viruses ranges from near zero for those inhabiting polar environments to over 40\u00baC for those inhabiting endothermic vertebrates. Nifong and Gillooly (2016) suggest that this could reflect smaller viruses being able to replicate more quickly (due to more compact genomes) perhaps together with energetic constraints imposed by their hosts. However from the thermodynamic perspective, the decrease in volume and hence mass and radius of the virus will make \u0394S a_immob less negative for a 9 smaller virus than for a larger virus. It is shown here how a less negative \u0394S a_immob increases binding of the virus at the relatively high mammalian body temperatures and it is proposed that thermodynamic binding constraints may give smaller viruses a selective advantage for infecting hosts at the higher body temperatures of mammals and birds. In this respect, the large size of the HIV virion may present a constraint to binding at human body temperatures compared to the much smaller arboviruses for example.\n\nIn the case of HIV, the GP component of the GP/Cr interaction is the envelope protein (Env) which is a trimer of gp120 monomers. Each HIV Env trimer interacts with one CD4 molecule (Chuang et al. 2017; Liu et al 2017a) . This is different from the AIV HA trimer in which each monomer in the trimer interacts with one glycan Cr (De Graaf and Fouchier, 2014; Fei et al. 2015) . Initial attachment of the HIV virion to the host CD4 + T cell surface is relatively nonspecific (Wilen et al. 2012) with HIV Env interacting with negatively charged host cell surface heparan sulphate proteoglycans, or with pattern recognition receptors. According to Wilen et al. (2012) , non-specific HIV attachment to the host cell via any of these factors likely brings HIV Env into close proximity with the viral receptor CD4 and the CRR5 coreceptor, so increasing the efficiency of infection, although the physiologic role of non-specific attachment in vivo remains unclear. Here it is suggested that non-specific binding helps to overcome the thermodynamic entropy constraint of immobilisation of a large virus on binding at human body temperature by taking some of the entropy loss in \u0394S a_immob prior to specific HIV Env:CD4 binding. This would be consistent with the fact that non-specific attachment factors differ from receptors in that they are not essential, although they augment infection in vitro (Wilen et al. 2012) .\n\nA review of the literature has not found any results for the effect of temperature on the binding of HIV to CD4 + T cells with which to test or validate the HIV thermodynamic binding model developed here. However, Frey et al. (1995) reported the binding of cells expressing HIV GP on their surface to CD4 + T cells over the temperature range of 0\u00b0C to 42\u00b0C. It is known that increasing host membrane fluidity at higher temperature allows effective recruitment of more Cr molecules to bind the HIV virion (Harada et al. 2004 ) such that the number, n, of GP/Cr contacts increases with temperature (Frey et al. 1995) , and that increasing n can overcome both the effect of temperature on decreasing the GP/Cr binding affinity and the effect of a large negative \u0394S a_immob (Gale 2019) . The thermodynamic HIV binding model here is therefore modified to accommodate increasing n with temperature and so attempt to reproduce the results of Frey et al., (1995) . The success of the model here is in predicting the subsequent decrease in binding reported by Frey et al. (1995) at higher temperatures due to \u0394S a_immob .\n\nHere six case studies are presented to illustrate the effects of the magnitude of n, \u0394C p and \u0394S a_immob on the temperature sensitivity of virus binding. These are:- It may be thought there is little point in modelling HIV binding with temperature because HIV only infects human hosts at ~37\u00baC. However, the model here suggests mammalian temperature may be a constraint on HIV binding (due to the large negative \u0394C p and \u0394S a_immob ) in effect exposing a potential weakness in the HIV infection process which could be exploited for antiviral therapy. The implications of making \u0394S a_immob more negative are considered here as a novel approach to developing antiviral therapies with reference to Antoine et al. (2012) using zinc oxide nanoparticles for preventing infection by herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2).\n\nThe change in enthalpy (H) with temperature (T) at constant pressure is the heat capacity, C p .\n\nIntegrating with respect to temperature relates the absolute enthalpy (H T ) at temperature T to that (H T0 ) at a given reference temperature T 0 through C p according to Equation 1 (see Table 1 ). The attachment of a virus to its host cell is driven by the n individual interactions between GP and Cr made on binding as represented by the dynamic equilibrium in Equation 2. The change in enthalpy for GP binding to Cr at temperature T, \u0394H a_receptor_T , is given by Equation 3.\n\nfor the enthalpies for the GP.Cr complex (H T (GP.Cr)), the free GP (H T (GP)) and the free Cr (H T (Cr)) relates the enthalpy change for GP binding to Cr at temperature T, \u0394H a_receptor_T , to that (\u0394H a_receptor_T0 ) measured experimentally at temperature T 0 (Du et al. 2016) according to Equation 4 where \u0394C p is the change in heat capacity defined as the difference between the heat capacities of the GP.Cr complex and the sum of the heat capacities of the free GP and Cr molecules as given by Equation 5. Similarly the entropy change (\u0394S a_receptor_T ) for GP binding to Cr at temperature T is related to that (\u0394S a_receptor_T0 ) measured experimentally at temperature T 0 (Du et al. 2016) according to Equation 6.\n\n\u0394H a_virus_T and \u0394S a_virus_T are the changes in enthalpy and entropy respectively on binding of virus to host cell at temperature T. Substituting the terms for \u0394H a_virus_T (Equation 7) and \u0394S a_virus_T \n\nFor this work it is assumed that the change in heat capacity on binding of a virus to a host cell is determined by the change in heat capacity on interaction of GP with Cr according to Equation 5 and that \u0394S a_immob in Equation 10 is unaffected. In effect therefore the heat capacity of the \"bulk\" (i.e. non-GP/Cr) of the bound virus/host cell is the same as the sum of the heat capacities for the free virus and free host cell. This is acceptable because a change in heat capacity is related to a change in conformation of the molecular components (Myszka et al. 2000) and the conformation of the bulk of the host cell and the virus would be unaffected by attachment. Indeed, \u0394S a_immob is mainly related to changes in rotational and translational mobility of the virus particle as a whole (see below) and does not involve the conformational changes in GP and Cr which are accommodated in the \u0394S a_receptor_T term (Gale 2019) . Since the heat capacity of the \"bulk\" of the bound virus/host cell is the same as the sum of the heat capacities for the free virus and free host cell, \u0394C p for the bulk equals zero, and according to Equation 6 therefore, \u0394S a_immob itself at temperature T (calculated as \u0394S a_immob_T = \u0394S a_immob_T0 + \u0394C p .ln(T/T 0 )) would be unaffected by temperature and hence constant as assumed in the models here.\n\n13 2.2.2 The effect of the magnitude of \u0394C p on virus binding affinity at temperature T.\n\nEquation 10 gives Equation 11 from which K a_virus_T is calculated according to Equation 12 where R is the ideal gas constant.\n\nComparing the predicted effect on K a_virus_T of the magnitude of \u0394C p in Case studies 1, 2 and 3 requires a reference temperature, T 0 , to be defined at which the plots of K a_virus_T intercept. Values of K a_virus_T intercept at T = T 0 because the n.\u0394C p (T -T 0 + T.ln(T/T 0 )) term in Equation 11 equals zero. Therefore for the purpose of demonstrating the effect of \u0394C p on the temperature sensitivity of K a_virus_T , T 0 needs to be chosen to be well above or below the temperature range of interest. It should be noted that the choice of reference temperature is artificial and is only used here out of necessity to demonstrate the effect of different \u0394C p values while fixing the K a_virus_T intercept temperature. Indeed a given GP/Cr system has its own natural \u0394C p value which cannot be altered and is measured experimentally (Myszka et al. 2000; Fei et al. 2015) . The T 0 temperature of 37\u00baC is appropriate to study arthropod vector competence for arbovirus transmission over the 10 to 35\u00baC temperature range in Case studies 1 and 2 as used previously for the arthropod vector competence model (Gale 2019) . However, since 37\u00b0C is the human body temperature at which HIV binds to host cells, 37\u00b0C is not a good choice for T 0 in case study 3 for which T 0 is therefore set to 4\u00b0C. The reference temperature is 37\u00b0C in Case studies 4, 5 and 6 because the experimentally measured value of \u0394C p for HIV gp120:CD4 binding ( Figure 1 ) is used together with \u0394H a_receptor_T0 and \u0394S a_receptor_T0 values measured experimentally at a temperature T 0 of 37\u00b0C (Myszka et al. 2000) , i.e. real data are used.\n\nThe approach for modelling arbovirus transmission efficiency by the arthropod vector has been fully described previously (Gale 2019) and is summarised here for the purpose of the models in Figure 2 and Figure 3.\n\nThe strength of GP/Cr binding at temperature T is often expressed as the dissociation constant, K d_receptor_T , for which smaller values indicate stronger binding (Xiong et al. 2013 ). The thermodynamic model is based on an enthalpy-driven GP/Cr interaction with a K d_receptor_T0 of 10 -3 M at 37\u00b0C (T 0 ) as used previously (Gale 2019) to represent the interaction between an arbovirus GP and a SA glycan (Cr) on the brush border surface of the epithelial cells lining the arthropod midgut.\n\nThe parameters \u0394H a_receptor_T0 and \u0394S a_receptor_T0 at T 0 = 37\u00b0C for DENV transmission by Aedes albopictus together with n and \u0394S a_immob are set out in Table 2 and values of K a_virus_T over the temperature range 10\u00baC to 37\u00baC are calculated for the \u0394C p values in Table 3 using \u0394G a_virus_T from Equation 11 in Equation 12.\n\nThe arbovirus challenge dose is 10 5 virions and the midgut volume is 10 -6 dm 3 giving a virus concentration [V total ] = 1.7 x 10 -13 M. The fraction (F cT ) of arthropod midgut cells with bound arbovirus at temperature T is calculated from K a_virus_T using Equation 13 assuming the concentration of free virus ([V free ]) ~ [V total ]. The number, C.V T , of midgut cells with bound arbovirus at temperature T is calculated by multiplying F cT by the total number of midgut cells (C total = 1,000) (Equation 14) as described previously (Gale 2019).\n\nThe probability, p completeT , of an arthropod midgut cell with bound virus successfully leading to infection of the arthropod salivary glands and completion of virogenesis within in the lifetime of the arthropod at temperature T is calculated using the Arrhenius equation (Equation 15) where p complete283 is the probability of this happening at 10\u00b0C (283 K) and E A is the activation energy of the rate-limiting step in virogenesis ( Table 2 ). The probability, p transmissionT , of arbovirus transmission by the arthropod (i.e. successful infection of the arthropod salivary glands after oral exposure) at temperature T given C.V T midgut cells have bound virus is given by Equation 16.\n\nThe magnitude of \u0394C p could explain the temperature peak observed in the specific binding of WEEV to susceptible Culex tarsalis BBFs.\n\nThe value of \u0394C p in Equation 11 with the GP/Cr binding parameters for DENV in Table 2 was optimised so that C.V T as a function of temperature best approximated the specific binding affinity of WEEV to BBFs from susceptible Culex tarsalis mosquitoes as determined by Houk et al. (1990) and shown in Figure 3 .\n\nHIV gp120:CD4 diminishes host cell binding at higher temperatures. Yang et al. (2005) using defective HIV gp120 monomers concluded that a single Env trimer is sufficient to mediate the entry of one virion, but that all three gp120 monomers in that trimer must be active. Klasse (2012) has proposed that a realistic model allows both a minimum requirement of two gp120 monomers with an increment in function by the third. This is consistent with the cryoelectron microscopy (EM) structure of the Env glycoprotein trimer (Liu et al. 2017a) showing that in each trimer, one gp120 monomer makes a primary contact with the bound CD4 Cr molecule while a second makes a partial contact (called the quaternary contact reflecting protein structure nomenclature) and the third gp120 monomer makes no direct contact with the CD4 at all. For the purpose of the model here, n represents the number of Env trimers on each HIV virion that interact with a CD4 Cr during binding. Brandenberg et al. (2015) demonstrate that divergent HIV strains differ in their stoichiometry of entry and require between 1 to 7 Env trimers, with most strains depending on 2 to 3 Env trimers to complete infection. Here it is assumed that n = 3 Env:CD4 interactions for HIV binding although the results of Brandenberg et al. (2015) do not separate cell surface binding itself from the subsequent HIV/cell fusion in the entry process. If it is later found that cell surface binding only requires one Env:CD4 interaction for example, while more are required for the membrane fusion, then the model here for C.V T should be re-parameterised with n = 1 although the number of Env:CCR5 and non-specific Env interactions with attachment factors (see below) should also be built into the model. It should be noted that as for the arbovirus model, it is assumed that the n = 3 Env:CD4 interactions act independently and not co-operatively in binding. This is reflected in Equation 7 and Equation 8 where \u0394H a_receptor_T and \u0394S a_receptor_T act additively.\n\nThe Env trimer binds a single soluble CD4 with a K d_receptor_T (25\u00baC) of 1.4 x 10 -9 M (Chuang et al 2017) which is 15-fold higher than that for the gp120 monomer:CD4 interaction estimated at 25\u00baC from the data of Myszka et al. (2000) in Table 4 . To the author's knowledge there are no data for \u0394H a_receptor_T and \u0394S a_receptor_T for Env trimer binding to CD4. Therefore the values for \u0394H a_receptor_T0 and \u0394S a_receptor_T0 for HIV gp120 monomer:CD4 binding at 37\u00b0C from Myszka et al. (2000) are used for Env trimer binding to a single CD4 in the HIV model in Figure 4a and b as set out in Table 4 . Dey et al. (2007) reported values at 37\u00baC of -287.9 kJ/mol and -786.9 J/mol/K for \u0394H a_receptor_T and \u0394S a_receptor_T respectively for the wildtype HIV-1 YU2 gp120 monomer binding to soluble CD4. The more negative \u0394S a_receptor_T value for gp120 monomer:CD4 binding from Dey et al. (2007) reduces the binding affinity for gp120:CD4 by nine-fold (K d_receptor_T = 4.2 x 10 -8 M) at 37\u00b0C compared to that of 4.75 x 10 -9 M from Myszka et al. (2000) (Table 4) . This difference may simply reflect the different strains of HIV-1 used, namely YU2 by Dey et al. (2007) and WD61 by Myszka et al. (2000) . The HIV gp120 monomer:CD4 binding data of Myszka et al. (2000) are chosen here over those of Dey et al. (2007) because Myszka et al. (2000) present the variation in \u0394H a_receptor_T with temperature as shown in Figure 1 together with information on \u0394C p which Dey et al. (2007) do not consider. It is therefore assumed here that \u0394C p = -5.02 kJ/mol/K for the Env trimer:CD4 interaction as reported by Myszka et al. (2000) for the gp120 monomer:CD4 interaction (Table 3) .\n\nValues of \u0394S a_receptor_T are not documented by Myszka et al. (2000) other than that at 37\u00b0C (Table 4) and values at lower temperatures are therefore calculated from that at T 0 = 37\u00b0C according to Equation 6 using \u0394C p = -5.02 kJ/mol/K for HIV gp120:CD4 (Table 3) . Some reassurance that Equation 6 is appropriate is that the value of \u0394S a_receptor_T of -493 J/mol/K predicted at T = 25\u00b0C by Equation 6 is very close to that of -473 J/mol/K calculated from the -T. \u0394S a_receptor_T value reported by Myszka et al. (2000) at 25\u00b0C (Table 4) .\n\nPredicted values for \u0394H a_receptor_T and \u0394S a_receptor_T for HIV Env:CD4 binding at 4\u00b0C are set out in Table 4 and are used as \u0394H a_receptor_T0 and \u0394S a_receptor_T0 respectively for the HIV model in Figure 4c and d with the reference temperature, T 0 , set to 4\u00b0C to assess the effect of varying \u0394C p on the temperature sensitivity of K a_virus_T and C.V T up to and above human body temperature.\n\nThe 2.5 to 97.5 percentile range for the number of CD4 + T cells in humans is 448 to 1,611 cells per mm 3 (10 -6 dm 3 ) of blood with a mean of 919 cells per mm 3 (Thakar et al. 2011) . The model here takes 1 mm 3 of blood with C total = 10 3 CD4 + T cells and introduces V total = 10 5 HIV virions.\n\nDividing 10 5 HIV virions in 10 -6 dm 3 by the Avogadro number gives [V total ] = 1.7 x 10 -13 M. The advantage of using a high V total that greatly exceeds C total is that as previously demonstrated by Gale (2018) not only may the fraction, F cT , of CD4 + T cells with bound HIV be calculated from Equation 13 with [V free ] ~ [V total ] but also any complications of handling stochastic effects at low virus doses are avoided. It is recognised that the HIV concentration at 10 5 HIV virions per mm 3 used in this model is 10-fold to 100-fold higher than that expected in a recipient person's blood present in the capillaries lining the skin at the wound site where semen or blood from an infected source were introduced since maximum human plasma and human semen HIV loadings are in the region of 13,000 copies per mm 3 and 1,800 copies per mm 3 respectively (Gupta et al. 1997 ). This is not important, however, because the purpose of the models here in Figure 4 , Figure 5 and Figure 6 is not to produce a realistic dose-response but to explore the effect of changing \u0394C p , \u0394S a_immob , n and temperature on the trend in the predicted number, C.V T , of host CD4 + T cells with bound virus.\n\nIndeed, the overall conclusions of the model in terms of the effect of temperature on the number of CD4 + T cells with bound virus will still be representative and the interpretation applicable to all doses of viruses as there is no cooperation between viruses in this model (Gale 2018) . Furthermore, the levels of SIV in Rhesus monkey blood plasma were in the region of 2.1 x 10 8 virions per ml (Huitron-Resendiz et al. 2007 ) which is 2.1 x 10 5 virions per mm 3 and representative of the 10 5 used for [V total ] in the model here. C.V T is calculated by multiplying F cT by C total (Equation 14).\n\nbinding at the higher temperatures of the human body through the large negative \u0394S a_immob .\n\nThere are currently no data available on the magnitude of \u0394S a_immob which was first defined through development of a thermodynamic model (Gale 2019) . Xiong et al. (2013) reported a K d_virus of 10 -15 M for AIV where K d_virus is the dissociation constant for virus from the host cell and is the inverse of K a_virus_T . According to Yang et al. (2005) HIV virions bearing influenza A virus HA required 8 or 9 HA trimers for virus entry. This is equivalent to n = 24 to 27 HA monomers each of K d_receptor = 10 -3 M (Xiong et al. 2013 ). It is not clear whether the 8 or 9 AIV HA trimers are required for cell binding or membrane fusion in Yang et al. (2005) . However, if n = 24 HA monomers are required for AIV binding to the host cell to give a K a_virus_T of 10 15 M -1 then \u0394S a_immob equals -1,091 J/mol/K from Equation 17 (derived in Gale 2019). This is in the same order of magnitude as the -750 J/mol/K estimated for \u0394S a_immob on the basis of virus molecular weight (Gale 2019) . It must be emphasized that the estimate of 8 or 9 HA trimers in Yang et al. (2005) is based on a number of assumptions that may not hold, for example whereas each infection of a cell is a quantal, all-ornothing event, the infectivity of a virion could span a wide spectrum of propensities and each mathematical model could have different virological interpretations (see Klasse 2012) . However, in the absence of any data for \u0394S a_immob the value of n from Yang et al. (2005) at least provides a theoretical approach to estimate it from Equation 17 for this \"proof of concept\" model.\n\nIt was shown previously (Gale 2019 ) that \u0394S a_immob is the sum of the changes in translational entropy (\u0394S trans ) and rotational entropy (\u0394S rot ) of the whole virus on binding. According to Mammen et al. (1998) Examples of diameters for arboviruses are ~50 nm for WNV (Mukhopadhyay et al. 2003 ) and DENV, 66 nm for Eastern equine encephalitis virus (Hasan et al. 2018 ) with BTV being slightly larger at 85 nm (Nason et al. 2004 ). In contrast, HIV is much larger with a mean diameter of 134 nm in the case of mature HIV virions containing a single core (Briggs et al. 2003 the number of CD4 + T cells in 1 mm 3 of blood with bound virus, C.V T is calculated for the HIV model using values of \u0394S a_immob which decrease in steps of 18.6% from -240 J/mol/K (i.e. to -285 J/mol/K, -337 J/Mol/K and -400 J/mol/K).\n\nand enhance specific virus binding through Env/CD4 interactions at human body temperature.\n\nThe term \u0394S a_immob represents the decrease in entropy of the virus on going from a freely rotating entity to being immobilised in a specific orientation on the host cell surface through n = 3 specific Env:CD4 interactions. Thermodynamically this could be accomplished in two consecutive steps whereby the virus first binds non-specifically to attachment proteins on the host cell surface with an entropy change of \u0394S a_non_specific , and then rolls into place driven by n = 3 specific Env:CD4 interactions resulting in a further entropy loss (\u0394S a_specific ) as the virus particle takes up a specific orientation ready for viral entry. In effect \u0394S a_immob is the sum of two components, namely \u0394S a_non_specific and \u0394S a_specific according to Equation 19. It should be noted that non-specific binding to HIV attachment factors would not increase \u0394S a_immob to zero because there are multiple ways a virus could bind non-specifically compared to the one way in which it binds to the CD4 receptors through a specific interaction between Env and CD4, that is the \u0394S a_specific term is always negative i.e. <0 J/mol/K and \u0394S a_non_specific is always less negative than \u0394S a_immob .\n\nPrior attachment through non-specific binding would realise the \u0394S a_non_specific loss before specific Env:CD4 binding so that specific binding involves the \u0394S a_specific term alone. The value of \u0394S a_immob is estimated to be -1,091 J/mol/K (see above) and for the purpose of demonstration here \u0394S a_immob is replaced by \u0394S a_specific in Equation 11 which is set to values of -400, -337, -285 and -240 J/mol/K in effect representing the effect of prior non-specific binding eliminating \u0394S a_non_specific values of -691, -754, -806 and -851 J/mol/K respectively according to Equation 19.\n\nTwo outputs of the model are demonstrated. The first output builds on the model in Case study 5 with a \u0394S a_specific of -206 J/mol/K to accommodate prior non-specific binding to attachment factors having eliminated the \u0394S a_non_specific of ~-900 J/mol/K. The model assumes n = 3 Env:CD4 interactions where n in Equation 11 is increased from n = 1 to n = 3 with temperature between 24\u00baC and 26\u00baC to represent the increase in contacts reported by Frey et al. (1995) .\n\nThe second output attempts to include non-specific binding and also CCR5 co-receptor binding and a \u0394S a_immob of -1,110 J/mol/K is used to represent the free virus binding (i.e. prior to non-specific binding). Kuhmann et al. (2000) demonstrated that approximately four to six CCR5 molecules assemble around the HIV virion to form a complex needed for infection. The model here assumes n = 2 non-specific Env interactions with attachment factors followed by n = 4 Env:CCR5 interactions according to Kuhmann et al. (2000) and finally n = 3 Env:CD4 interactions based on Brandenberg et al. (2015) to form a complex for binding with n = 9 contacts in total which increase from 1 to 9 with temperature as shown in Figure 6 . Doranz et al. (1999) estimated the K d_receptor_T of interaction between CCR5 and HIV gp120 to be 4 x 10 -9 M. This is remarkably similar to the K d_receptor_T for the interaction between CD4 and HIV Env of 4.75 x 10 -9 M at 37\u00b0C (Table 4 ) and the same values for \u0394H a_receptor_T0 and \u0394S a_receptor_T0 not only for the four HIV Env:CCR5 interactions but also for the two non-specific interactions are therefore used as for the three HIV Env:CD4 interactions in Table   4 with the reference temperature, T 0 at 37\u00b0C.\n\nPublished values of \u0394C p for protein/protein binding and for AIV HA binding to SA glycans vary in magnitude (Table 3) . For the binding of HIV gp120 to CD4 which is a protein-protein interaction, the magnitude of \u0394H a_receptor_T becomes more negative as the temperature increases i.e. \u0394C p is negative (Figure 1) . Similarly, negative values of \u0394C p were reported for other protein-protein systems, namely the binding of E3 and E1 proteins, respectively, in the assembly of the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase (Jung et al. 2002) , although with \u0394C p values less negative than that for HIV gp120:CD4 (Table 3 ). In contrast for AIV HA binding to the SA glycan the magnitude of \u0394C p is not significantly different to zero with \u0394H a_receptor_T constant over the temperature range 15\u00baC to 25\u00baC at least for binding of both \uf0612-3 and \uf0612-6 sialyllactose (Figure 1 ).\n\nValues of K a_virus_T predicted over the temperature range of 10\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C using different values of \u0394C p intercept at the reference temperature (T 0 ) of 37\u00b0C (Figure 2a) with K a_virus_T = 10 12 M -1 as expected for n = 4 GP/Cr interactions each of K d_receptor_T0 of 10 -3 M (Equation 17). With \u0394C p = 0 kJ/mol/K as for AIV HA/SA, K a_virus_T increases with decreasing temperature according to the Van't Hoff Isochore. In contrast with \u0394C p = -5.02 kJ/mol/K as for HIV gp120:CD4, K a_virus_T peaks at 26\u00b0C and decreases rapidly at lower temperatures.\n\nFor the simulated DENV/Ae. albopictus model used here, small negative values of \u0394C p (-2.0 kJ/mol/K to 0 kJ/mol/K) have little effect on the probability of transmission at low temperatures ( Figure 2c,d) . This is because in the model here with \u0394C p in the range of-2.0 kJ/mol/K to 0 kJ/mol/K, K a_virus_T is high at >10 14 M -1 at low temperatures ( Figure 2a ) and thus C.V T is little affected until higher temperatures (Figure 2b ) at which K a_virus_T falls below 10 14 M -1 (Figure 2a) .\n\nLarge negative values of \u0394C p (-5.0 kJ/mol/K) cause C.V T to peak rapidly falling at lower temperatures ( Figure 2b ). This has a large effect on the predicted probability of transmission at lower temperatures with p transmissionT 44-fold lower at 10\u00b0C (Figure 2d ). It is interesting to note that \u0394C p has little effect on p transmissionT over the range of temperature (23\u00b0C to 32\u00b0C) at which laboratory vector competence experiments (Liu et al. 2017b ) are typically conducted (Figure 2c ).\n\nThe magnitude of \u0394C p could explain the temperature peak observed in the specific binding of WEEV to susceptible Culex tarsalis BBFs.\n\nWith a \u0394C p = -3.0 kJ/mol/K the magnitude of K a_virus_T between 0 and 40\u00baC is relatively constant compare to those with \u0394C p = 0 kJ/mol/K and -5.02 kJ/mol/K (Figure 3a ) varying by only 40-fold and peaking at 1.62 x 13 13 M -1 at 18\u00baC. However, this variation in K a_virus_T between 10 12 and 10 13 M -1 is optimal for affecting the number of midgut cells with bound virus (Figure 3b ). This is because K a_virus_T is high enough such that a significant proportion of midgut cells have bound virus over the 0\u00baC to 40\u00baC temperature range but not high enough to exceed the 10 14 M -1 above which all the midgut cells are saturated with virus. The variation in C.V T with temperature with \u0394C p = -3.0 kJ/mol/K shows some similarity to the percentage variation in the amount of WEEV bound to BBFs from susceptible Culex tarsalis mosquitoes as measured experimentally by Houk et al. (1990) as represented by the symbols in Figure 3b . According to Houk et al. (1990) the K a_virus_T at 20\u00b0C for WEEV binding to BBFs from susceptible Culex tarsalis mosquitoes is 2.2 x 10 11 M -1 . This is within two orders of magnitude of the value of 1.57 x 10 13 M -1 predicted by the model here with \u0394C p = -3.0 kJ/mol/K (Figure 3a) .\n\nHIV gp120:CD4 diminishes host cell binding at higher temperature.\n\nK a_virus_T values for HIV binding and C.V T values for the number of CD4 + T cells in 1 mm 3 of blood with bound HIV as a function of temperature are shown in Figure 4a and b respectively for different \u0394C p values with T 0 = 37\u00b0C. The K a_virus_T and C.V T values in Figure 4a and b respectively assume n = 3 Env:CD4 contacts with thermodynamic parameters in Table 4 and \u0394S a_immob = -400 J/mol/K.\n\nThe large negative value of \u0394C p of -5.02 kJ/mol/K reported for gp120:CD4 (Table 3 ) diminishes binding at higher temperatures compared to \u0394C p of 0 kJ/mol/K. Thus from Figure 4b , only half of the 1,000 cells have bound virus at 12\u00baC with \u0394C p = -5.02 kJ/mol/K while with \u0394C p = 0 kJ/mol/K half the cells still have bound virus at a temperature of 6\u00b0C higher (18\u00baC). With \u0394C p = -5.02 kJ/mol/K, C.V T is <1 cell (i.e. no virus bound) at 22\u00baC while with \u0394C p = 0 kJ/mol/K the slightly higher temperature of 24\u00baC is required to decrease C.V T to <1 cell (Figure 4b) .\n\nThe three lines representing K a_virus_T for different values of \u0394C p in Figure 4a intercept at 37\u00b0C (T 0 ) and would do for C.V T in Figure 4b if extrapolated to 37\u00b0C. To demonstrate how the magnitude of \u0394C p affects K a_virus_T at temperatures of 37\u00b0C representing mammalian body temperature, the reference temperature is set to 4\u00b0C such that the three plots for K a_virus_T intercept at 4\u00b0C in Figure   4c with much lower K a_virus_T values predicted at 37\u00b0C with a large negative \u0394C p than for a system with \u0394C p = 0 kJ/mol/K. The effect of \u0394C p on the number of cells with bound virus at higher temperatures is considerable with C.V T reduced to 1 cell at 22\u00b0C with \u0394C p = -5.02 kJ/mol/K compared to 31\u00b0C with \u0394C p = 0 kJ/mol/K (Figure 4d ).\n\nIt should be noted that the dashed lines in Figure 4c and d are the same as those in Figure 4a and b respectively being based on experimental data for HIV gp120:CD4 (Figure 1 ). The purpose of the dotted and solid lines is merely to illustrate the effect of less negative \u0394C p increasing the binding at higher temperatures for the purpose of understanding.\n\nFrom Equation 18, \u0394S a_immob becomes more negative as the diameter of the virus increases. The value of K a_virus_T decreases with increasing temperature in Figure 5a while more negative values of \u0394S a_immob merely shift each parallel curve to lower K a_virus_T values as expected from Equation 17\n\nsuch that K a_virus_T falls below 10 14 M -1 at progressively lower temperatures. Values of C.V T with \u0394S a_immob decreasing from -240 J/mol/K to -400 J/mol/K in steps of 18.6% are plotted in Figure 5b and show that the number of cells with bound virus falls to <1 at progressively lower temperature as \u0394S a_immob becomes more negative through increasing the virus diameter. The temperature at which C.V T falls to <1 is predicted to increase from 22\u00b0C to 43\u00b0C as \u0394S a_immob increases in magnitude from -400 J/mol/K to -240 J/mol/K. The conclusion from Figure 5a and Figure 5b is that smaller viruses with less negative \u0394S a_immob bind more strongly at higher temperatures than larger viruses.\n\nOnly with \u0394S a_immob as high as -240 J/mol/K representing smaller viruses do more than 30% of the 1,000 cells have bound virus at the human body temperature of 37\u00b0C according to the model in Figure 5b . This is shown in Figure 5c where nearly all the cells have bound virus at 10\u00b0C irrespective of \u0394S a_immob while at higher temperatures fewer cells have bound virus as \u0394S a_immob becomes more negative. Figure 5 can also be interpreted in terms of the effect of prior non-specific binding of HIV to attachment factors eliminating \u0394S a_non_specific values of -691, -754, -806 and -851 J/mol/K according to Equation 19 thus increasing \u0394S a_specific for specific Env:CD4 binding (as \u0394S a_immob in Equation   11 ) from -400 J/mol/K to -240 J/mol/K. Figure 5b shows that the number of CD4 + T cells in a 1 mm 3 volume of blood with bound HIV falls from 1000 to <1 over a temperature range of ~10\u00b0C.\n\nThe temperature at which fewer than half the T cells in the 1 mm 3 volume of blood have bound HIV virus increases with increasing \u0394S a_specific from 12.5\u00b0C for \u0394S a_specific = -400 J/mol/K to 36.5\u00b0C for \u0394S a_specific = -240 J/mol/K (Figure 5b) . Indeed once the \u0394S a_specific is >-200 J/mol/K, 98% of the 1,000 T cells have bound HIV at 37\u00b0C (not shown). With \u0394S a_specific <-285 J/mol/K virus is not specifically bound to any of the 1,000 T cells at temperatures above 37\u00baC. It is concluded that the effect of making \u0394S a_immob less unfavourable through prior non-specific binding taking some of the entropy loss enhances subsequent specific binding of HIV through Env:CD4 interactions at higher temperatures. Figure 5c shows that at 37\u00baC increasing \u0394S a_specific from -400 to -240 J/mol/K increases the number of CD4 + T cells with HIV bound through specific Env/CD4 interactions in a 1 mm 3 volume of blood from 2 x 10 -6 to 307. It should be noted that 2 x 10 -6 cells in 1 mm 3 is equivalent to 1 cell in 500 cm 3 of blood.\n\nCells expressing HIV gp120 on their surface can bind and fuse with cells expressing CD4 Cr (Frey at el. 1995) . Frey et al. (1995) reported a three to four fold increase in cell binding at temperatures above 25\u00b0C with a substantial decrease in binding at temperatures above 37\u00b0C (Figure 6 ), the latter being predicted by the thermodynamic model in Figure 5b . Frey et al. (1995) attribute the increase at 25\u00b0C to the additional adhesion molecules which are brought into contact to increase the avidity of binding at higher temperatures. The thermodynamic model for HIV binding with \u0394S a_immob of -206 J/mol/K reproduces the increase in predicted C.V T in Figure 6a by increasing n from 1 to 3 over the temperature range 25\u00b0C and 27\u00b0C to reflect the effect of temperature facilitating multiple HIV adhesion/binding sites due to increased membrane fluidity (Frey et al. 1995; Harada et al. 2004 ).\n\nIncreasing n from 1 to 9 over the temperature range 19\u00baC and 27\u00baC gives a sharp increase in C.V T at 26\u00b0C (Figure 6b ) with \u0394S a_immob of -1,110 J/mol/K. The subsequent sharp fall in C.V T at temperatures above 37\u00b0C is due to the large negative magnitude of \u0394S a_immob (-206 J/mol/K in Figure 6a and -1,110 J/mol/K in Figure 6b ) relative to n such that the diminished GP/Cr affinity at higher temperatures is not sufficient to maintain binding even with n = 9 GP/Cr interactions in Figure 6b . The decrease in GP/Cr binding affinity with temperature for HIV Env:CD4 is apparent from the K a_virus_T values in Figure 5a and the increase in the values of K d_receptor_T for the temperatures 4\u00b0C, 25\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C in Table 4 .\n\nPreviously a thermodynamic model for the effect of temperature on arthropod vector competence was developed (Gale 2019) based on the parameters \u0394H a_receptor_T , \u0394S a_receptor_T , \u0394S a_immob and n, together with the kinetic parameters, p complete283 and E A (Table 2 ). This paper furthers that model by allowing the change in heat capacity, \u0394C p , on GP/Cr binding to be included. This is important because it defines the effect of temperature on \u0394H a_receptor_T (Equation 4) and \u0394S a_receptor_T (Equation 6) and hence K a_virus_T . Of potentially greater importance, however, is the parameter \u0394S a_immob first formally identified in the thermodynamic analysis of virus binding (Gale 2019) . Thus it is proposed here that the value of \u0394S a_immob is not only important in explaining the observation that dsDNA viruses infecting warmer hosts are generally smaller in volume than those infecting colder hosts (Nifong and Gillooly 2016) but also may contribute to explaining the need for attachment factors to allow binding of a large virus such as HIV at the relatively high human body temperature of 37\u00baC.\n\nThis has implications for the design of novel antiviral therapies. The mechanistic model developed here for HIV goes as far as cell binding and viral membrane fusion (Harrison 2015) could be added as the next stage to complete the cell entry process.\n\nCalculations using Equation 17 on the basis of limited available data suggest \u0394S a_immob ~ -1,100 J/mol/K for HIV although it is acknowledged above that there is considerable uncertainty in the absence of definitive experimental data. It is possible that statistical thermodynamics approaches analogous to the Sackur-Tetrode equation for the entropy of a gas may be developed to estimate \u0394S a_immob theoretically. The large size of the HIV virion (134 nm mean diameter) compared to a typical arbovirus (50 to 70 nm diameter) is consistent with a more negative value of \u0394S a_immob providing justification for the more negative \u0394S a_immob values used here for the HIV models in Figure 4 to Figure 6 compared to that used for the arbovirus models in Figure 2 and Figure 3 . Figure 2 to Figure 5 show the variation of K a_virus_T and C.V T with temperature as predicted by models assuming C total = 10 3 host cells in a 10 -6 dm 3 volume (i.e. mosquito midgut or human blood sample) challenged with V total = 10 5 virions. Previously it was shown that if K a_virus_T > ~10 14 M -1 then nearly all the host cells have bound virus at such a high virus dose (Gale 2018; 2019) . Thus the K a_virus_T plots and corresponding C.V T plots are best interpreted in terms of the temperature ranges over which K a_virus_T < ~10 14 M -1 .\n\nFor the arbovirus models in Figure 2 and Figure 3 , the main conclusion regarding the change in heat capacity on GP/Cr binding is that as \u0394C p becomes more negative so a peak temperature for K a_virus_T becomes apparent such that binding affinity falls at lower and higher temperatures, directly affecting C.V T when K a_virus_T falls below 10 14 M -1 . Values of \u0394C p from 0 to ~-2.0 kJ/mol/K have relatively little impact on the temperature sensitivity of the number, C.V T , of mosquito midgut cells with bound virus (Figure 2b) , while intermediate values of \u0394C p of ~-3.0 kJ/mol/K give a peak binding at a temperature of ~20\u00b0C as observed experimentally for WEEV binding to BBFs from susceptible mosquito midguts in Figure 3b . More negative values of \u0394C p at -5.0 kJ/mol/K greatly diminish arbovirus binding affinity at temperatures below ~20\u00b0C (Figure 2b ) which in turn diminishes the transmission efficiency of the arbovirus at temperatures below 20\u00b0C compared to GP/Cr systems with \u0394C p in the range of -2.0 to 0 kJ/mol/K (Figure 2d ). In evolutionary terms, to optimise arbovirus infectivity with n = 4 GP/Cr interactions over a range of temperatures, GP/Cr interactions with small \u0394C p would be selected as for AIV HA/SA binding (Table 3) . It is proposed here that to maintain some transmission efficiency at lower temperatures, arboviruses may use SA binding interactions as shown for BTV coat protein VP2 (Zhang et al. 2010 ) for which \u0394C p may approximate 0 kJ/mol/K as in the case of AIV HA/SA (Table 3 ). This would facilitate arboviruses' expanding their range into temperate regions of the world with climate change.\n\nWith the reference temperature of T 0 = 37\u00baC, C.V T falls rapidly at temperatures above 20\u00baC in the arbovirus model here with n = 4 GP/Cr interactions irrespective of the magnitude of \u0394C p ( Figure   2b ) as the K a_virus_T values fall below 10 14 M -1 and converge at 10 12 M -1 at 37\u00baC (Figure 2a ). This fall is observed experimentally as the temperature is increased from 20\u00baC to 40\u00baC (Figure 3b ) for WEEV binding to BBFs from susceptible mosquito midguts as reported by Houk et al. (1990) .\n\nThe \u0394C p for HIV gp120:CD4 binding is well documented unlike that for arbovirus binding and the values of \u0394H a_receptor_T have been reported over the temperature range of 12\u00baC to 44\u00baC (Figure 1 ).\n\nThe results with varying \u0394C p in Figure 4 are therefore hypothetical but illustrate how the large negative \u0394C p for the HIV Env:CD4 interaction diminishes binding at the higher temperatures of mammals and birds compared to a system such as HA/SA for which \u0394C p = 0 kJ/mol/K. Thus, a less negative \u0394C p increases the number of cells with bound virus at higher temperatures, albeit more markedly for the reference temperature T 0 = 4\u00baC (Figure 4d ) than for T 0 = 37\u00baC (Figure 4b ). In the absence of data for \u0394C p for HIV Env:CD4 binding, the value for the gp120 monomer:CD4 interaction is used for the HIV models in Figure 4 , Figure 5 and Figure 6 . Evidence for a large negative \u0394C p for HIV Env:CD4 binding is that cryo-EM demonstrates considerable conformational shifts (Liu et al. 2017a ).\n\nA negative value of \u0394S a_immob presents a repulsive force between the virus and the host cell in effect preventing virus binding and with n = 0 GP/Cr contacts, K a_virus_T is < 1 M -1 according to Equation 17 (Gale 2019) . Increasing the value of n is one way for the virus to overcome a large negative value of \u0394S a_immob (Gale 2019) . Thus 15 to 18 GP/Cr contracts of K d_receptor_T0 = 10 -3 M (37\u00b0C) were sufficient to overcome a \u0394S a_immob of -750 J/mol/K such that K a_virus_T > 10 14 M -1 (Figure 3 of Gale (2019)). This is apparent from Figure 6a where n = 3 GP/Cr contacts can overcome a \u0394S a_immob of -206 J/mol/K while n = 9 GP/Cr contacts are required to overcome the more negative \u0394S a_immob of -1,110 J/mol/K in Figure 6b .\n\nEven for \u0394S a_immob = 0 J/mol/K as in Figure 2a and Figure 3a , the magnitude of K a_virus_T decreases with increasing temperature (albeit after a peak in the case of \u0394C p < -2.0 kJ/mol/K). This is due to the reduced affinity of the enthalpy-driven GP/Cr interactions at higher temperatures. Making \u0394S a_immob more negative shifts the K a_virus_T curve to lower values (Figure 5a ) thus exacerbating the effect of higher temperature on reducing binding. As K a_virus_T falls below 10 14 M -1 at higher temperatures, so C.V T falls (Figure 5b ). The magnitude of \u0394S a_immob merely positions the C.V T curve relative to the temperature scale with less negative values of \u0394S a_immob shifting the curve to higher temperatures (Figure 5b) such that high C.V T values are maintained at progressively higher temperatures as \u0394S a_immob becomes less negative (Figure 5c ).\n\nThe thermodynamic model here suggests that a large negative \u0394C p for HIV Env:CD4 diminishes binding at higher temperatures. However, there may be molecular constraints such that a large negative \u0394C p value is a direct consequence of a molecular mechanism involving a large conformational change that serves a purpose for cell entry/fusion (Harrison 2015) such that a negligible \u0394C p value may not be achievable. Furthermore, a large negative \u0394S a_immob imposes additional constraints on virus binding at higher temperatures exacerbating the reduced strength of the enthalpy-driven GP/Cr interactions at higher temperatures. Therefore other mechanisms may be needed by the virus to achieve binding at 37\u00b0C. These could include more GP/Cr contacts at higher temperature (Frey et al. 1995; Harada et al 2004) . An alternative strategy evolved by viruses could be to make \u0394S a_immob itself less negative such that virus binding is maintained at the higher body temperatures of mammals and birds. Two possible evolutionary strategies are suggested here which could make \u0394S a_immob less negative. The first is decreasing the size of the virus and the second is the use of non-specific attachment factors to randomly trap the virus on the cell surface prior to specific GP/Cr binding.\n\nDecreasing the size of a virus makes \u0394S a_immob less negative (Equation 18) such that smaller viruses bind more strongly at the higher temperatures of mammals and birds ( Figure 5 ). It is suggested that binding to cells at the higher temperatures of avian and mammalian hosts selects for viruses of smaller diameter through a less negative \u0394S a_immob . This could explain the decrease in volume of viruses with increasing host/environment temperature as reported by Nifong and Gillooly (2016) for dsDNA viruses. Thus the average diameters of dsDNA viruses decreased from 182 nm at a host/environment temperature of 10\u00baC down to 74 nm at 37\u00baC according to the best fit line of Nifong and Gillooly (2016) suggesting the HIV virion at 134 nm mean diameter is almost double the size for a virus infecting at avian/mammalian host temperature.\n\nIt is proposed here that by taking the entropy loss \u0394S a_non_specific in \u0394S a_immob that non-specific binding to attachment factors facilitates subsequent specific HIV Env binding to CD4 receptors on the host CD4 + T cell at human body temperature. Thus the shift in the K a_virus_T curve to higher values with a less negative \u0394S a_immob in Figure 5a is consistent with HIV attachment factors augmenting infection (Wilen et al. 2012) . Indeed with n = 3 Env:CD4 contacts, significant binding of HIV to host cells is only achieved at 37\u00b0C if \u0394S a_immob is increased to > -280 J/mol/K (Figure 5c ). \u0394S a_immob is estimated here to be -1,091 J/mol/K for HIV. Thus the prior non-specific binding of HIV would need to realise a \u0394S a_non_specific of -810 J/mol/K for subsequent effective Env:CD4 binding at human body temperature according to the model such that \u0394S a_non_specific in Equation 19 takes ~75% of the entropy loss in \u0394S a_immob . Wilen et al. (2012) also report that HIV attachment factors are not essential. Again this is consistent with the model here when it is noted that the C.V T value of <1 CD4 + T cell with bound virus in Figure 5b is not a threshold and merely represents 1 mm 3 of blood. Thus with \u0394S a_immob = -348 J/mol/K, C.V T = 1 x 10 -3 at 37\u00baC (Figure 5c ). This represents one CD4 + T cell with bound HIV in 1,000 x 1 mm 3 volumes of blood, i.e. in 1 cm 3 of blood. Decreasing \u0394S a_immob further to -405 J/mol/K gives C.V T = 1 x 10 -6 at 37\u00baC representing one CD4 + T cell with bound HIV in 1 litre of blood.\n\nThe model here suggests human body temperature may be a constraint on HIV binding (due to the large negative values of both \u0394C p and \u0394S a_immob ) in effect exposing a potential weakness in the HIV infection strategy which could be exploited for antiviral therapy. Figure 9 of Antoine et al. (2012) shows a herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) bound to a tetrahedral nanoparticle of zinc oxide (ZnO) called a zinc oxide tetrapod (ZnOT). The mechanism behind the ability of ZnOTs to prevent, neutralize or reduce HSV-2 infection relies on their ability to bind the HSV-2 virions (Antoine et al. 2012 ). The ZnOT being some 40 \u00b5m in size is much larger than the attached virion which could still attach to a host cell surface in terms of spatial considerations. However, the magnitude of \u0394S a_immob for a HSV-2 virion bound to a ZnOT nanoparticle would be very large and negative, indeed much more negative than for \u0394S a_immob for a free HSV-2 virion. Thus according to Figure 5c , binding of HSV-2/ZnOT to host cells would be greatly diminished particularly at the human body temperature due to the very large negative \u0394S a_immob . It is proposed that antiviral research should take into account and even focus on making the magnitude of \u0394S a_immob more negative in addition to looking at conventional approaches to block the GP/Cr interaction. The advantage of focusing on \u0394S a_immob is that only one ZnOT nanoparticle has to bind to a virus to markedly affect \u0394S a_immob , while a large proportion of the GP molecules on the virus have to be bound with inhibitors, including neutralising antibodies, to block virus binding (Klasse 2012) and hence eliminate \u0394H a_receptor_T0 in Equation 11.\n\nThe temperature dependence of virus diffusion in mucus (Erickson et al. 2015) could also be considered not only in mechanistic dose-response models for viral infection at mucosal epithelial membranes in the intestine (Gale 2018) but also in terms of therapeutics when combined with the thermodynamic approach developed here. Normal, acidic cervicovaginal mucus greatly hinders the movement of virions of HSV and HIV, whereas mucus that is neutralized by semen provides a much less effective barrier against the same virions (Erickson et al. 2015) . Thus binding of the HSV or HIV virion to a ZnOT particle may not only decrease its diffusion coefficient in mucus but also make the magnitude of \u0394S a_immob more negative hence reducing the binding affinity of those virions which do make it through the mucus to the epithelial cell surface at human body temperature.\n\nIt is assumed for the purpose of the \"proof of concept\" model here that the thermodynamic parameters for the HIV gp120 monomer:CD4 interaction in Myszka et al. (2000) can be used for HIV Env trimer binding to a single CD4 in the absence of data. Although the K d_receptor_T value for the Env trimer:CD4 interaction (1.4 x 10 -9 M, Chuang et al. 2017 ) is 15-fold higher than that for the gp120 monomer:CD4 interaction (0.9 x 10 -10 M, Table 4 ) at 25\u00baC, this is close enough to support using the gp120 monomer:CD4 data, particularly as K d_receptor_T values for the gp120 monomer:CD4 interaction vary nine-fold between two HIV strains (see above).\n\nThe predicted values of K a_virus_T increase with decreasing temperature according the HIV model in Figure 5a . This is unexpected on the basis of the \u0394H a_receptor_T values reported by Myszka et al. (2000) for gp120:CD4 which become less negative with decreasing temperature (Figure 1 ).\n\nHowever, according to Equation 6 the predicted \u0394S a_receptor_T term becomes more favourable (less negative) with decreasing temperature and it is therefore the entropy term that facilitates the tighter binding of gp120 to CD4 at lower temperatures. Unfortunately Myszka et al (2000) only give the full range of values for \u0394H a_receptor_T (Figure 1 ) with no data for \u0394S a_receptor_T over the range of temperature. However, Myszka et al (2000) do give some graphical data from which \u0394S a_receptor_T at 25\u00baC can be estimated and it is reassuring this \u0394S a_receptor_T is much less negative at -473 J/mol/K than that of -691 J/mol/K measured at 37\u00baC and furthermore is actually less negative than the value of -492.8 J/mol/K predicted for 25\u00baC by Equation 6 (Table 4) and used in the model in Figure 5 . This is strong experimental evidence that warming to 37\u00baC and above does indeed give a significant reduction in the binding affinity of Env to CD4 as borne out by the 52-fold increase in the K d_receptor_T value for gp120:CD4 on warming from 25\u00baC to 37\u00baC as calculated from the actual data of Myszka et al (2000) (Table 4 ). Furthermore it suggests that the actual increase in K a_virus_T on cooling from 37\u00baC down to 25\u00baC may be greater than that predicted by the model in Figure 5a . The decrease in binding affinity with increasing temperature for HIV Env:CD4 is also supported by experimental data of Moore and Klasse (1992) which showed that soluble CD4 dissociated from HIV virions at temperatures above 35\u00b0C. Similarly Doranz et al. (1999) demonstrated that gp120 bound to CD4 + T cells began to dissociate at temperatures above 45\u00b0C. The data of Frey et al. (1995) in Figure 6 offer further validation of the model in that the binding of HIV Env-expressing cells to cells expressing CD4 decreases substantially at 37\u00baC as predicted by the model. The Env trimer is stable up to at least 60\u00baC (Chuang et al. 2017) suggesting it is not denaturation of the Env trimer itself that is responsible for the decreased binding at higher temperatures. However, care has to be taken in using Equation 4 and Equation 6 to predict \u0394H a_receptor_T and \u0394S a_receptor_T respectively down to very low temperatures. Thus although the predicted value of K d_receptor_T for gp120:CD4 at 4\u00baC is 3,700-fold lower than that at 37\u00baC (Table 4) , Frey et al. (1995) cite some studies which suggested weaker binding of soluble CD4 to HIV virions at 4\u00baC compared to 37\u00baC. Without actual binding data for HIV over the full temperature range, it cannot ruled out that K a_virus_T does not exhibit a peak with temperature as for the WEEV binding in Figure 3b . Indeed, binding of 125 Ilabeled gp120 to T cells peaked at 16\u00baC with binding at 4\u00baC much lower than that at 37\u00baC (Frey et al. 1995) . The increase between 4\u00baC and 16\u00baC is unlikely to be due to increased fluidity of the membrane allowing recruitment of more CD4 molecules because unlike the virus, each gp120 only binds a single Cr molecule. Dimitrov et al. (1992) showed that the activation energy for binding of soluble CD4 to cells expressing HIV Env changed at 18\u00baC suggesting 18\u00baC is a transition temperature. This could explain the peak in binding of gp120 at 16\u00baC reported by Frey et al. (1995) .\n\nto temperatures below 18\u00baC may not be justified in the case of HIV binding.\n\nIt should be remembered that HIV only infects humans at 37\u00baC and therefore the lower temperature predictions are more of academic interest, although temperature trends may give an insight into weaknesses in the HIV infection strategy as suggested here. It is only the 37\u00baC line in Figure 5c which is important for HIV and it is reassuring to note that this is based on actual experimental data for gp120 monomer:CD4 binding measured at that temperature. The lower temperature lines in Figure 5c are of more general interest, for example in explaining the observed relationship (Nifong and Gillooly 2016) between larger virus volume and lower host temperature.\n\nIndividual virions of the same virus may vary both in size (Briggs et al. 2003) and in the case of RNA viruses in the actual base sequence of the genome giving a spectrum of mutants. The infection process may represent a bottleneck such that only one or two viral variants in the exposure dose successfully establish infection (Bull et al. 2011) . Thus in the case of norovirus, only minor variants at frequencies as low as 0.01% were successfully transmitted to establish a new infection (Bull et al. 36 2012) . The work here suggests that the actual size of the virion itself may present an additional constraint particularly at mammalian body temperatures. Thus although the average diameter for HIV virions with a single core is 134 nm, individual virions display a broad range of diameters extending from 120 to 200 nm with a skewed distribution (Briggs et al. 2003) . Furthermore while the majority of HIV virions contained a single core, almost a third contained two or more cores. The mean diameter of the HIV virions containing a single core (134 \u00b1 11 nm, n = 89) was significantly smaller than the mean diameter of virions containing two cores (158 \u00b1 16 nm, n = 43) (Briggs et al. 2003) . Thus the magnitude of \u0394S a_immob may vary between individual HIV virions within the same exposure dose. The key conclusion from Figure 5c is that the number of CD4 + T cells with bound virus is highly sensitive to the magnitude of \u0394S a_immob with just a 4.5% increase in the magnitude of \u0394S a_immob from -290 to -277 J/mol/K for example increasing C.V T by five-fold from 1 to 5 CD4 + T cells per mm 3 of blood at 37\u00baC. Thus smaller diameter viruses in a challenge does may have an advantage in binding and hence initiating infection at mammalian body temperatures. This also raises the question of the magnitude of \u0394S a_immob for an aggregate containing several virions of the same virus and in the case of EBOV, for the long filaments linking multiple genome copies (Beniac et al. 2012 ). It has previously been proposed that fusing multiple genome copies into the same filament in the case of EBOV takes some of the entropy loss for \u0394S a_immob prior to binding to the cell surface (Gale 2017) such that aggregation can be viewed as a cooperative effect in the infection process. The effect of aggregation and virus size on the magnitude of \u0394S a_immob according to Equation 18 needs to be investigated and understood to further the work here.\n\nFrom a thermodynamic perspective, the affinity of virus binding to a host cell is greatly decreased at the higher body temperatures of mammals and birds such that temperature can be considered a constraint to be overcome. The relationship between binding affinity and temperature can be markedly affected by the change in heat capacity (\u0394C p ) on virus binding through its effect on the enthalpy and entropy of the GP/Cr interaction. Specifically large negative values of \u0394C p reduce binding at both low and high temperatures giving a peak binding at a medium temperature as has been observed experimentally in binding of WEEV to mosquito midguts. Very large negative values of \u0394C p for protein/protein GP/Cr interactions are predicted to diminish arbovirus transmission at low temperatures compared to the HA/SA glycan interaction for which \u0394C p is negligible. Thus selecting for SA glycan interactions as reported for BTV binding may be a mechanism to allow transmission at the lower temperatures experienced by arboviruses infecting arthropods in temperate regions of the world.\n\nThe magnitude of \u0394S a_immob is currently unknown but is predicted to be large and negative and to be more negative for larger viruses such as HIV (mean diameter 134 nm) compared to the smaller arboviruses (diameter 50 to 70 nm). Small virion diameter through a less negative \u0394S a_immob , favours virus binding at higher temperatures giving smaller viruses a selective advantage for infecting hosts at the higher body temperatures of mammals and birds. This is in agreement with the published observational findings that virus volume decreases with increasing host temperature in the case of dsDNA viruses.\n\nIn the case of HIV, the unfavourable effect at human body temperature of the large negative \u0394S a_immob value due to the large size of the virus may be overcome by non-specific binding. It is proposed here that non-specific binding of HIV as the virus first randomly attaches to a host CD4 + T cell surface takes a large proportion (represented by \u0394S a_non_specific ) of the entropy loss of \u0394S a_immob such that HIV can then bind specifically through Env:CD4 interactions at the relatively high temperature of the human body. The randomly attached virus \"rolls into place\" driven by n = 3 specific Env:CD4 interactions resulting in a further entropy loss (\u0394S a_specific ) as the virus particle takes up a specific orientation ready for viral entry. Non-specific attachment factors are all the more important for a GP/Cr system such as the HIV Env:CD4 interaction for which \u0394C p is large and negative and diminishes binding at higher temperatures.
