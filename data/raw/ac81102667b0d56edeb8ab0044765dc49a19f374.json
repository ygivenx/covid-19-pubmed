{"title": "Determination of host cell proteins constituting the molecular microenvironment of 1 coronavirus replicase complexes by proximity-labeling 2", "body": "8 peptide of only 14 amino acids at the carboxyterminus of polyprotein 1a with a yet unassigned 159 role or function in coronavirus replication, (ii) the structural proteins spike (S) protein, 160 envelope (E) protein, and membrane (M) protein, which mainly localize to sites of viral 161 assembly before being incorporated into newly-formed viral particles, and (iii) all accessory 162 proteins (NS2a, HE, ORF4, ORF5a). Altogether, these results validate the proximity-163 dependent biotinylation approach and demonstrate the specific and exclusive labeling of MHV-164 RTC-associated proteins (Fig. 2d) . 165\n\nThe BirAR118G biotin ligase biotinylates proteins in its close proximity that must not necessarily 166 have tight, prolonged, or direct interaction (31). Therefore, the identified RTC-proximal host 167 proteins, recorded over the entire duration of the MHV replication cycle, likely include proteins 168 that display a prolonged co-localization with the MHV RTC, proteins that may locate only 169 transiently in close proximity to the RTC, and proteins of which only a minor fraction of the 170 cellular pool may associate with the RTC. To this end, we assessed the localization of a limited 171 proteins, were not amongst the significantly enriched proteins. Our data further suggest that 185 the RTC microenvironment may be highly dynamic and likely also contains proteins that are 186 only transiently present in the microenvironment or only comprise a sub-fraction of the cellular 187 pool in close proximity to the MHV RTC. terms were highly significant (p-value <0.005) (Fig. 3a , Table S2 ). Additional analysis using 195 network analysis, using STRING, revealed at least 4 distinct clusters of interacting factors 208 within this category (Fig. 3b) . Cluster I, protein transport, comprised nuclear transport 209 receptors at nuclear pore complexes, such as importins and transportins. Interestingly, this 210 cluster also contained Sec63, which is part of the Sec61 translocon (44) and has been implicated 211 in protein translocation across ER membranes. The list of RTC-proximal factors also included 212 signal recognition particles SRP54a and SRP68 (Table S2) In order to assess the potential functional relevance of RTC-proximal factors identified in our 266 MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2-mediated proximity-dependent screen, we designed a custom siRNA 267 library individually targeting the expression of each of the 513 identified RTC-proximal host 268 proteins. siRNA-treated L929 cells were infected (MOI=0.05, n=4) with a recombinant MHV 269 vesicular transport between the ER, Golgi apparatus and endosomal compartments for the 283 establishment of replication organelles, several factors contained within these pathways 284 impaired MHV replication as exemplified by the siRNA-mediated silencing of Kif11, Snx9, 285 Dnm11, Scfd1, Ykt6, Stx5a, Clint1, Aak11, or Vapa (Fig. 4b) . Consistently, ER-associated 286 protein sorting complexes associated with the ribosome and newly synthetized proteins (Naca, 287 BTF3, SRP54a, SRP68) that were revealed in the GO enrichment analysis (Fig. 3a, table S2) , 288 also appear to be required for efficient MHV replication (Fig. 4b) . 289 Furthermore, we also observed significantly reduced MHV replication upon silencing of core 290 elements of the 26S and 20S proteasome complex (Psmd1 and Psmc2, and Psmb3, 291 respectively), suggesting a crucial role of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway for efficient CoV 292 replication (27, 52). Indeed, this finding may provide a link to the described coronavirus RTC-293 encoded de-ubiquitination activity residing in nsp3 that has been implicated in innate immune 294 evasion (16, 17, 54). 295\n\nMost interestingly, this custom siRNA screen identified a crucial role of the host protein 296 synthesis apparatus that was associated with the MHV RTC as indicated by the proximity-297 dependent proteomic screen (Fig. 3a, c) . Silencing of ribosomal proteins Rpl13a and Rls24d1 298 and several subunits of the eIF3 complex resulted in greatly reduced MHV replication and 299 scored with highest significance in the siRNA screen, suggesting that proximity of the host cell 300 translation machinery to the viral RTC likely has functional importance for coronavirus 301 replication (Fig. 4b) . 302 303 Active translation near sites of viral mRNA synthesis 304 .

For this, we selected all host 306 factors assigned to the category \"translation\" (Fig. 3a) and assessed virus replication following 307 siRNA-mediated silencing of each factor. Measurement of luciferase activity after MHV-Gluc 308 infection confirmed initial findings obtained by screening the entire siRNA library of MHV 309 RTC-proximal factors (Fig. 4c) . Specifically for Rpl13a, and eIFs 3i, 3f, and 3e viral replication 310 was reduced to levels comparable to our controls Ceacam1a (MHV receptor) and Gbf1 (24). 311\n\nConsistently, cell-associated viral mRNA levels (Fig. 4d ) and viral titers ( The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/417907 doi: bioRxiv preprint coronaviruses, such as HCoV-229E or the highly pathogenic MERS-CoV (Fig. 6) . The HCoV-331 229E RTC, which was detected with an antiserum directed against nsp8, appeared as small and 332 dispersed perinuclear puncta during early infection and eventually converged into larger 333 perinuclear structures later in infection. Consistent with findings obtained for MHV, we 334 observed a striking co-localization of the HCoV-229E RTC with sites of active translation 335 during the early phase of the infection (Fig. 6, S4) .

We therefore 381 expect that this approach will find wide application in the field of virus-host interaction, target 382 identification for virus inhibition, and provides a starting point to reveal similarities and 383 differences between replication strategies of a broad range of viruses. 384\n\nOne novel finding that arose immediately from our RTC-proximity screen is the demonstration 385 of a close spatial association of host cell translation with the coronavirus RTC. Indeed, the 386 biotin ligase-based proteomic screen identified a number of translation initiation factors, most 387 prominently several eIF3 subunits that were found to have functional importance for viral 388 replication, and numerous ribosome-and translation-associated proteins within the coronavirus 389 RTC microenvironment (Fig. 3, 4) . In addition, the presence of subunits of the signal uncorrected Dunn's test) was used to test the statistical significance of reduced viral replication 641 (mean < 95% as compared to scramble control, n=216).
