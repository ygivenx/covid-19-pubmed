{"title": "Assays for the Identification of Novel Antivirals against Bluetongue Virus", "body": "BTV is a prototype double-stranded RNA virus in the genus Orbivirus, family Reoviridae. BTV is one of the most important diseases of domestic livestock, including sheep, goat, cattle and other domestic animals, with $3 billion/year loss worldwide 1, 2 . The exotic BTV serotype is an important animal pathogen listed in the \"USDA High Consequence Livestock Pathogens.\" Recently, the re-emerging of BTV has caused a major outbreak of disease in cattle and sheep in several countries across Northern Europe 3, 4 . As a result of its economic significance and as a model system, BTV has been the subject of extensive molecular, genetic and structural studies, and several vaccines have been developed. However, due to the lack of proper assays for antiviral drug discovery, there are no antivirals available against BTV.\n\nIn a recent high throughput screening (HTS) campaign using BTV as the model system, we developed, optimized and validated a CPE-based assay to identify potential broad-spectrum antivirals against arboviruses 5 . CPE-based assay is a well-recognized assay that has been used in antiviral drug discovery against a number of viruses that induced rapid and observable CPE/apoptosis [5] [6] [7] . In our system, post BTV infection, CPE is evident in vertebrate cells, including HeLa, BSR, and HEK 293T 8 . BTV-induced CPE could be monitored and quantified using various cell viability detection methods, including the CellTiter Glo cell viability reagent kit (CTG kit) 9 . This kit determines the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of cellular ATP presented, which signals the presence of metabolically active living cells. Under optimized conditions, the CPE-based assay presented here showed its feasibility with the \"mix and measure\" one step protocol, and flexibility with stable luminescent signals. Meanwhile, toxic compounds reducing cell viability will be excluded in this CPE-based assay. The CPE-based assay showed its robustness and reliability for antiviral drug discovery against BTV, and has been used to screen the NIH Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR), which leads to the identification of six novel cluster of potential antiviral lead compound(s) 5 .\n\nWhen a potential antiviral compound has been identified using the CPE-based assay, it will need to be subjected to the ten-concentration dose-response assay to determine the range of antiviral efficacy and cytotoxicity 2 . The antiviral efficacy, represented as the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) or the 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ), is the concentration of a drug which inhibits virus-induced CPE halfway between the baseline and maximum. The cytotoxicity of the antivirals, i.e. the 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC 50 ), is the concentration of a drug inducing 50% of cytotoxicity between the baseline and maximum. The selective index (SI), denoted as 50% SI (SI 50 ) is calculated from CC 50 / IC 50 which determines the specificity of the antiviral against virus-induced CPE. The IC 50 (or EC 50 ), CC 50 and SI 50 values are critical measures to determine whether an antiviral compound is potent and selective for further drug development.\n\nWhen an antiviral showed no overt toxicity in vitro, yet prevented virus induced CPE and the productive viral life-cycle, it is important to characterize its MoA 2 . We initiated such characterization by carrying out ToA assay to determine the possible step(s) of viral life-cycle that is affected by the antiviral. Generally, antiviral compound were added to cells at different times pre-or post-virus infection. If the antivirals were added to the infected cells post to its target step during the course of infection, it would result in lower activity when compared to the one which was added prior to the step. Thus, ToA study is critical for determining the antiviral efficacy of a compound, and its potential target, either on the viral life-cycle or the host machinery involved in the viral life-cycle.\n\nFor all three assays, cell viability was determined using the CTG kit following manufacturer's instruction 5 . This detection system outputs adequate luminescence signals that could be analyzed using various in-house software. Each assay was validated and performed at least in triplicate with eight replicas. For all the obtained data, three parameters, including mean value (AVE), standard deviation (STDEV), and coefficient variation (CV) were analyzed to determine the robustness of the assay. Once the robustness of the assay has been determined, the data will be further analyzed and plotted using various biostatics and graphic tools 2 .\n\n1.

The ten-dose response assay was employed to reflect the antiviral efficacy and cytotoxicity of an identified lead compound by measuring the number of metabolically viable cells in culture based on quantitation of cellular ATP presented in the living cells 5, 11 . In our previous report, a number of potential antiviral compounds were evaluated, including compounds from each cluster identified via HTS against BTV 5 , and their derivatives via de novo synthesis 2 . Based on their EC 50 , CC 50 and SI 50 , several promising lead compounds were identified with potent antiviral efficacy, low toxicity and high selectivity. For example, compound052 (C052) was determined to have an EC 50 of 0.27\u00b10.12 \u03bcM (Figure 1 . The SI 50 of C052 was determined at 306 based on its EC 50 and CC 50 values. The nanomolar scale antiviral efficacy, low toxicity, and consequently high SI 50 indicated that C052 might be a potent and selective antiviral against BTV.\n\nThe ToA assay was aimed to determine the possible stage(s) of viral life-cycle targeted by compounds. When adding C052 at 1 or 2 hr prior to BTV infection, i.e. -1 and -2 h.p.i., the antiviral efficacies remained at the nanomolar scale (Figure 2) 2 , indicating that C052 might act beyond the early stage of viral life-cycle, such as virus entry. Furthermore, the antiviral efficacy remained unchanged until C052 was added to infected cells as later as 24 h.p.i.. When added at 32 h.p.i., the percentage of viable cells decreased in C052 treatment cells, indicating that C052 was less protective at this stage of viral life-cycle. When added at 48 h.p.i., there was no protection to BSR cells from BTV-induced CPE. Since the first cycle of BTV viral replication usually completed in infected cells within 24 h.p.i., our results suggested that C052 might act at the late stages of BTV viral life-cycle, such as virus replication, packaging, maturation and egress. Meanwhile, it is also possible that C052 may act on host cellular machineries that were involved during late viral life-cycle \n\nFor the initial identification of antiviral hits, one of the key steps for antiviral drug discovery and development is to develop robust assays, which includes selecting a quantifiable marker, developing a simple protocol, obtaining sufficient signals and less than 10% CV. Most biochemical or cell-based screens are designed to provide a chemical starting point based upon the most robust, simple and inexpensive assay, due to the required reproducibility in the screening process and the potentially large number of molecules to be screened. The CPE-based assay was designated to meet these requirements to identify effective hits from a large compound library. CPE refers to the adverse effect on the cultured cells associated with the multiplication of viruses. Various assays are available to use the CPE indicator through measuring a variety of different markers indicating the number of dead cells (cytotoxicity), the number of live cells (viability), and the mechanism of cell death (apoptosis). Commercial reagents for CPE-based assay are available with a simple assay protocol. For example, the CTG kit includes the single \"mix and measure\" step and has been widely used to quantify virus induced CPE. However, CPE-based assay is limited to viruses that could induce rapid CPE. For viruses that do not induce rapid CPE, various assays have been developed. For example, the replicon-based assay using the replicon-harboring cell line allows screening for inhibitors of viral replication, including translation, polyprotein processing, and minus-and plus-strand RNA synthesis [12] [13] [14] . The antisense RNA strategies and virtual screening of small-molecule libraries also could be used to identify possible antivirals 15, 16 . Nevertheless, it is critical that the efficacy of an antiviral drug be validated in the in vitro cell-based assay which allows the evaluation of antiviral efficacy against the entire viral life-cycle. CPE-based assay has been successfully adapted into high throughput format and is one of the most reliable and robust assay for the screening of large compound libraries, including recently accomplished HTS screenings against influenza virus 6, 17 , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 18 , arenaviruses 19 , and Reovirus (Bluetongue virus) 5 .\n\nThe dose-response assay was designated to further validate the antiviral efficacy of the hits identified via the single dose CPE-based assay, usually after screening a large compound library. These hits, although identified with antiviral activity, need further confirmation to reveal their potentials to become a drug. Antiviral efficacy of a compound could be revealed through the analysis via EC 50 , CC 50 and SI 50 value using the dose response analysis. Meanwhile, out off-target or false positives will be identified, and the number of lead compounds could be narrowed down. Via this analysis, the order of compound potencies and toxicities could be ranked to direct future antiviral drug discovery, especially for the structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis and future medicinal chemistry modification. In fact, compound C052 was a derivative of compound C003, which associated with good drug-like properties both in vitro and in vivo.\n\nTo meet the requirements for a drug, it is a must to determine its MoA, i.e. to characterize the interaction of a compound with its target at physiologic concentrations. Various assays have been developed of particular antivirals, i.e. to not only inhibit the target but to have acceptable solubility, permeability, protein binding, selectivity, metabolism and toxicity profiles. Since MoA studies were low-throughput assay needing laborious efforts, only a few selected molecules, with potent EC 50 , high CC 50 and high SI 50 value, could be readily analyzed. An understanding the MoA of a compound at this stage can add depth to the interpretation of cellular activity or its absence. The ToA study is designated to narrow down the stage when the antiviral interacts with viral or host targets. Knowing a compound is competitive with a substrate in certain stage viral life-cycle could provide an immediate direction for further MoA analysis. Alternatively, more potent cell based assay with known mechanism, including assay directly screen for HIV-1 integrase inhibitors 20 , inhibiting virus binding to surface protein 21 could be used which provide known MoA before actual screenings 22 . While hits from these screening may well-related to the designated MoA, there actually MoA may also need to subject to ToA and other mechanism of action studies.\n\nIn summary, using the three assays reported here, we have successfully screened and identified several potent antivirals against BTV, including C003 and C052 2 . In particular, the SI 50 (of C052 was up at 306, which suggested that C052 is highly selective against BTV. Via the ToA and other MoA studies presented in the original paper, we proposed that C052 could be a potential antiviral agent interacting with host autophagy machinery, could be developed into an anti-BTV drug.\n\nThe authors declare that they have no competing financial interests."}
