{"title": "A hidden gene in astroviruses encodes a cell-permeabilizing protein involved in virus release", "body": "Humans astroviruses (HAstVs) belong to genus Mamastrovirus within the family Astroviridae.\n\nORF1b (RdRp) amino acid sequences were extracted and aligned, and a phylogenetic tree constructed (Fig. S1 ). We follow the genogroups defined in Yokoyama et al. 8 . Although the more-divergent CP sequences may provide a less robust phylogenetic analysis, we also constructed a CP-based phylogenetic tree to test for possible recombination (Fig. S2 ). At the level of genogroup the ORF1b and CP trees were consistent, although within genogroups there were some differences between the topologies of the two trees. For simplicity, we used the ORF1b tree to define astrovirus clades for full-genome analyses.\n\nWe grouped astrovirus sequences into clades (Fig. 1B) , generated codon-based alignments of concatenated ORF1a-ORF1b-ORF2 coding sequences within each clade, and analyzed the alignments with synplot2 which tests for regions where synonymous substitutions occur less often than average for the sequence alignment 9 . Regions with significantly enhanced synonymous site conservation typically harbour overlapping functional elements which constraint sequence evolution 9 . The analysis of subgroup \"Ia\" astroviruses ( Fig. 1B ; classical HAstVs besides some feline and sea lion astroviruses) revealed conserved elements at the junction of ORF1a and ORF1b (representing the ribosomal frameshifting signal and ORF1a/ORF1b overlap), upstream of ORF2 (presumed to represent elements involved in sgRNA synthesis), towards the 3\u2032 end of ORF2 (possible replication elements), and overlapping the 5\u2032 end of ORF2 (the putative overlapping ORFX) (Fig. 1C) . We applied the same analysis to 13 other astrovirus genogroup or sub-genogroup clades, revealing conserved regions overlapping the 5\u2032 end of ORF2 in genogroup I, III and IV astroviruses but, generally (see below for exceptions), not in genogroup II or VI astroviruses (Fig. S3) .\n\nWe repeated the synonymous site conservation analysis using clades, sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees based on only ORF2 in order to rule out potential artefacts as a result of possible recombination between the nonstructural and structural modules of the virus genome, and to include additional part-genome sequences (total 415 sequences with ORF2 coverage; Fig. 1D; Fig. S4 ). This analysis revealed conserved regions overlapping the 5\u2032 end of ORF2 throughout genogroup I, III and IV astroviruses but, generally, not in genogroup II or VI astroviruses (Fig. S5 ). Those clades with synonymous site conservation also contain a conserved overlapping +1 frame ORF, whereas those sequences without synonymous site conservation generally also lacked a conserved overlapping +1 frame ORF (Fig. S5) .\n\nInterestingly, we also detected synonymous site conservation in two subgroups of genogroup II astroviruses ( Fig. S3G; Fig. S3H ). In subgroup \"IId\", the conservation coincided with a conserved overlapping +1 frame ORF (Fig. S5E) ; however in subgroup \"IIc\", there was no conserved ORF in the +1 reading frame. Instead, we observed an ORF in the \u22121 reading frame . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

It seems plausible that ORFX and ORFY in genogroup II astroviruses may have evolved independently of ORFX in other astrovirus genogroups (see Discussion).\n\nEvidence for ORFX was also found in a clade of rodent astroviruses of unassigned genogroup ( Fig. S3D; Fig. S5L ). Further, a number of unclustered divergent sequences also contain long +1 frame ORFs overlapping the 5\u2032 end of ORF2 that potentially encode XP proteins (Fig. S7 ).\n\nNote that genogroup V -represented by a single partial sequence, FJ890355 (bottlenose dolphin astrovirus 1) -is one of these. Table S1 ). Similar to other overlapping genes, which generally evolve de novo 11 , the XP peptide sequences show little to no homology to known protein domains. Many XP sequences contain a predicted TM domain, and some other XPs contain a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids that resembles a TM domain despite being scored below threshold by Phobius (Fig. S8, Fig. S9 ).\n\nTo test for XP expression in infected cells, we first raised various antibodies against XP peptides and we also tested the viability of tagged-XP viruses. However, neither antibody nor tagged virus approaches were successful. Thus we turned to ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq). Ribo-Seq is a high throughput sequencing technique that globally maps the footprints of initiating or elongating 80S ribosomes on mRNAs 12, 13 . We infected Caco2 cells and performed Ribo-Seq at 12 hours post infection (hpi). Ribo-Seq quality was assessed as previously described 14 (Fig.   S10 ). Using flash-freezing with no drug pre-treatment (NT), we mapped the translational landscape of the HAstV1 genome ( Fig. 2A) . ORF2 is translated at ~9\uf0b4 the level of ORF1a, whereas ORF1b is translated at ~25% the level of ORF1a, indicating a ribosomal frameshifting efficiency of ~25%. The higher expression of ORF2 is likely a result of higher levels of sgRNA than gRNA in the translation pool. To identify translation initiation sites, we utilized the translation inhibitor lactimidomycin (LTM), which acts preferentially on the initiating ribosome but not on the elongating ribosome 15 . LTM binds to the 80S ribosome already assembled at the initiation codon and occupies the empty exit (E-site) of initiating ribosomes, thus completely blocking translocation. Using this approach, we confirm the two previously known initiation . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

Such reads will not ligate to the adapter oligonucleotides and thus will be excluded from sequencing. This may explain why the ORF2 initiation peak is smaller than the ORF1a initiation peak, even though ORF2 is expressed at much higher levels than ORF1a. Thus we cannot quantify the ORF2:ORFX expression ratio from the LTM data.\n\nRibosome profiling of eukaryotic systems typically has the characteristic that mappings of the 5\u2032 end positions of ribosome protected fragments (RPFs) to coding sequences reflect the triplet periodicity (herein referred to as \"phasing\") of genetic decoding. For our datasets, the great majority of RPF 5\u2032 ends map to the first nucleotide of codons (Fig. 2C, left) . Reads mapping to the ORF2/ORFX part of the genome (NT samples) were quantified in the three possible phases.\n\nIn the region of ORF2 that is overlapped by ORFX we observed an increased number of reads mapping in the +1 phase relative to the ORF2 reading frame (Fig. 2C , middle) compared to the region of ORF2 that is not overlapped by ORFX (Fig. 2C , right) or the coding regions of host mRNAs (Fig. 2C, left) . Quantification of the differences in phasing indicated that ORFX is translated at ~27% of the level of ORF2, although it should be noted that reporter assays (see below) are expected to provide more accurate quantification than RPF phasing analysis.\n\nXP-knockout viruses are attenuated but pseudo-revert on passage.\n\nTo evaluate the significance of ORFX in the context of virus infection, a set of mutant virus genomes was created based on the pAVIC1 infectious clone 16 by introducing mutations that knock out ORFX without affecting the CP amino acid sequence (Fig. 3A) . Four independent mutations were introduced to guard against the possibility of affecting potential RNA secondary structures overlapping with this region, resulting in pAVIC1-AUGm (AUG to ACG), pAVIC1-PTC1 (stop codon after 20 amino acids), pAVIC1-2\u00d7PTC (double stop codon after 20 amino acids) and pAVIC1-PTC2 (stop codon after 73 amino acids) ( Fig. 3B; Fig. S11 ). Corresponding T7 RNA transcripts were used for virus rescue in Huh7.5.1 cells followed by infection in Caco2 cells. All four ORFX knockout viruses were strongly attenuated compared to wt virus (Fig. 3C ).\n\nAfter seven blind passages in Caco2 cells, two mutant viruses (pAVIC1-AUGm and pAVIC1-.

It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/661579 doi: bioRxiv preprint PTC1) demonstrated an \uf07e1 log increase in virus titers, which was achieved via a pseudoreversion (pAVIC1-AUGm) or 5 or 8 codon deletions (pAVIC1-PTC1) (Fig. 3C ). All three mutations would result in restoration of XP expression, confirming its importance in virus growth.\n\nXP is essential for virus release but has only a minor effect on RNA replication.\n\nORFX overlaps ORF2, which encodes the structural polyprotein, and therefore the expression of XP is likely required in late stages of the virus replication cycle. To rule out the possibility of XP directly influencing viral RNA replication, we developed a replicon system comprising an intact astrovirus genome up to the end of ORFX, followed by a 2A-RLuc cassette fused in either the ORF2 or ORFX reading frame, followed by the last 624 nt of the virus genome and a poly-A tail (Fig. 4A) . These replicons provide a direct measurement of translated product associated with activity of the subgenomic promoter. Two ORFX knock-out mutations were copied in both versions of the replicon to evaluate the significance of XP for RNA replication (Fig. 4B ). Experiments were performed in BSR and Huh7.5.1 cell lines, both of which have been reported to support astrovirus replication 16, 17 . Replication was confirmed by an 1200-2100 fold difference in relative luciferase activity between wt and an RdRp knockout mutant (GDD \u2192 GNN) at 9 and 12 hours post transfection (Fig. 4C, Fig. S12A ). The mutations introduced to knock out ORFX had minor effect on luciferase activity when 2A-RLuc was fused in the ORF2 reading frame (Fig. 4C, Fig. S12A ). Consistent with our Ribo-Seq results (Fig.   2C ), luciferase activity for the ORFX reading frame was 14% (BSR cells; Fig. 4C ) and 21% (Huh7.5.1 cells; Fig. S12A ) of luciferase activity for the ORF2 reading frame. Thus, ORFX is efficiently translated but has only a minor (if any) direct effect on viral RNA replication.\n\nAs expected, both XP knockout mutations resulted in a substantial drop in ORFX-frame luciferase activity (Fig. 4D, Fig. S12B ). This drop was more pronounced for the PTC mutant (5.5\u00b10.7% wt in BSR cells and 4.1\u00b11.7% in Huh7.5.1 cells) than for the AUGm mutant (AUG to ACG; 17.9\u00b10.1% wt in BSR cells and 13.2\u00b10.3% in Huh7.5.1 cells). ACG codons are known to permit initiation when in a strong initiation context (e.g. A at \u22123 and G at +4 as in the AUGm mutant) 18 . Since we wished to only use mutations that were synonymous in ORF2, we were unable to mutate the ORFX AUG codon in any other way. When utilized as an initiation codon, ACG is expected to be decoded as methionine by initiator Met-tRNA. Therefore the AUGm mutant is still expected to produce wt XP, albeit at a greatly reduced level.

Although effective replication occurred even in the absence of XP translation (Fig.   4C ), the introduced mutations could still have a potential effect on sgRNA production via alteration of RNA structure and/or other interactions. To map the minimal region required for wt levels of sgRNA production in the context of the pO2RL replicon, we gradually truncated the sequence between the start of ORF2 and ORFX. Surprisingly, we found that a replicon containing only the first 4 or 28 nucleotides of ORF2 has very poor subgenomic reporter activity (0.6\u00b10.03 and 12.5\u00b10.1% that of wt pO2RL, respectively). In contrast, including the first 46 nucleotides of ORF2 restored subgenomic reporter activity to 92% of wt (Fig. 4F , S12C). These data suggest that the astrovirus subgenomic promoter is significantly longer than previously reported 19 and extends into the 5\u2032 part ORF2, but does not appear to extend into ORFX.\n\nTo determine which stage of the virus replication cycle is affected in XP knock-out viruses, we quantified released virus and viral protein and RNA levels for BSR cells electroporated with in vitro transcribed full-length pAVIC1 T7 RNAs. As expected, neither RNA nor protein levels were affected in cell-derived samples (Fig. 4G ). In contrast, in media-derived samples, XP mutant titers were significantly below wt titers when analyzed by qRT-PCR (fold differences = 0.08 and 0.05, p = 0.002 and 0.003 for AUG vs wt and PTC vs wt respectively; 2-tailed t-tests with separate variances) or virus titration (Fig. 4G ). These analyses indicate the involvement of XP late in the virus replication cycle, with XP potentially acting in either virus assembly or virus release. Since previous structural studies on the HAstV CP 20 and virion 21 have not indicated the presence of any additional proteins in the compact 43-nm virion structure, the more likely role for XP is in virus release.\n\nXP localizes to plasma membrane and perinuclear membranes with an extracellular Nterminus topology.\n\nTo further investigate the function of XP, we studied its intracellular localization. To make the small XP protein more stable and enable visualization in transfected cells, we fused it either Nor C-terminally with mCherry in the context of a mammalian expression vector. The diffuse cytoplasmic localization of mCherry was drastically affected in both fusions, where it was relocalized to plasma and perinuclear membranes (Fig. 5A ). This strongly suggests the presence of a membrane-interacting domain in XP, which was not predicted by TM domain prediction software ( Fig. S8 ; see Methods). Since ORFX is completely embedded within ORF2, it may have greatly decreased evolutionary flexibility, perhaps resulting in the evolution of a non-. CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

Some of the putative XP proteins encoded by other astroviruses do in fact have predicted TM regions (Fig. S9 ). We also confirmed membrane and nuclear association of the XP-fused mCherry proteins by subcellular fractionation of transfected HeLa cells and subsequent analysis of the fractions (Fig. 5B ). To investigate the potential topology of XP within the plasma membrane, we probed live electroporated HeLa cells with anti-mCherry antibody, fixed the cells and analyzed them by confocal microscopy. We observed punctate staining across the plasma membrane when mCherry was fused to the N-terminus but not when it was fused to the C-terminus, suggesting an extracellular N-terminal topology and potential multimerization ( Fig. 5C-D) .\n\nXPs from HAstV1 and related astroviruses have a viroporin-like activity.\n\nGiven the above results, we hypothesized a possible viroporin function for XP. Viroporins are virus-encoded ion channel proteins which disturb membrane integrity leading to permeabilization. Given the C-terminal below-threshold TM predictions for HAstV XPs (Fig.   S8 ), we hypothesized that the C-terminal region might harbour a TM pore-forming domain.\n\nAdditional support came from Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity profiles (Fig. 6B ) and a Cterminal \u03b1-helical structure prediction for HAstV1-8 XPs (Fig. S14) . A helical wheel representation of this region revealed a penta-leucine hydrophobic face in HAstV1 (Fig. 6A ).\n\nAlthough these leucines are not entirely conserved between the eight HAstV serotypes (Fig.   1F ), each XP was still predicted to contain an amphipathic \u03b1-helix in this region 22 . To test for viroporin-like activity, we utilized a previously described Sindbis virus replicon (SINV repC) 23 to overexpress XP or control proteins in mammalian cells. This replicon has been demonstrated to be an extremely useful tool for investigating viroporins from different RNA viruses via induced permeabilization of the plasma membrane in BHK cells to the translation inhibitor hygromycin B (HB). BSR cells (a clone of BHK cells) were electroporated with in vitro transcribed SINV repC RNAs, and new protein synthesis was labelled with Lazidohomoalanine (AHA) in the presence or absence of HB, followed by lysis and click chemistry-based on-gel detection 24 . Expression of XP or Strep-tagged enterovirus 2B (a wellcharacterized viroporin 25 ) led to almost total inhibition of protein synthesis (Fig. 6C-D) indicating that both proteins induced pronounced cell permeabilization to HB.\n\nAnother widely used assay to assess the ability of proteins to permeabilize cellular membranes is based on impaired growth of Escherichia coli upon induced overexpression of a membranepermeabilizing protein 26, 27 . Consistent with the results observed in the mammalian system, . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

There are two features that are generally associated with viroporin membrane permeabilizing activity: (i) an amphipathic \u03b1-helix that facilitates oligomerization to form the TM pore, and (ii) adjacent positively charged residues that anchor the viroporin in the membrane 27, 28 . To test for these features in XP, two conserved RR motifs present in all eight HAstV serotypes (Fig. 1F ) were mutated to alanines (Fig. 6F) . Interestingly, only the mutation of the very C-terminal arginines resulted in loss of XP activity in this system (Fig.   6G ). Mutation of the hydrophobic leucine stretch (L95, L98, L102, L105 and L109, Fig. 6A ) to serines and threonines (Fig. 6F ) also resulted in complete loss of XP activity (Fig. 6G) . Thus, the C-terminal domain of XP is involved in membrane permeabilization and harbours key features of a viroporin.\n\nTo investigate conservation of XP activity across different astrovirus species, we tested several other astrovirus XPs in the bacterial lysis assay. We used XPs from closely related HAstV4, feline (FAstV; genotype Ia), canine (CAstV; genotype Ib) and distantly related porcine (PAstV4; genotype IIIc) astroviruses in this experiment (Fig. 6H ). Protein expression constructs were created to express XPs with N-or C-terminal Strep tags, and combinations resulting in detectable protein were chosen for the assay. Induction of each of the four XPs resulted in strong inhibition of bacterial growth (Fig. 6I) , with XP expression confirmed by western blot (Fig. 6J ).\n\nSimilar to HAstV XPs, all tested proteins contain one or two predicted amphipathic \u03b1-helices ( Fig. S15) . Thus, these findings indicate that this newly identified astrovirus protein has a membrane-permeabilizing function.\n\nThe data presented here demonstrate the existence of an additional protein, XP, encoded within the human astrovirus genome. XP is important for virus growth, localizes to the plasma membrane, and plays a role in virus release. Viroporins have been reported for many enveloped and non-enveloped viruses and -although they can play roles in virus entry and modulation of cellular pathways -most often they facilitate virus assembly or release 26 . However, no viroporin candidate had been previously predicted for astroviruses. Identifying a viroporin is challenging due to the lack of homology among viroporins from different viruses. Viroporins are typically small hydrophobic integral membrane proteins of around 100 aa in size, with two motifs -an amphipathic \u03b1-helix and an adjacent cluster of positively charged residues; mutation of these residues generally abolishes viroporin activity 27 . Using two different assays and . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/661579 doi: bioRxiv preprint computational approaches, we show that XP fulfils these criteria. XP is capable of permeabilizing cellular membranes and has a distinct N-terminal extracellular topology with one TM domain, thus making XP a candidate class IA viroporin, a class which also includes the influenza A virus M2, coronavirus E and HIV-1 Vpu proteins 26, 28 . Future work will be needed to confirm potential ion channel activity, and characterize ion specificity, structural organisation, and processes affected by XP expression in the context of viral infection. The localization of XP not only at the plasma membrane but also in the perinuclear region raises the possibility that XP may also have additional functions. Whereas the C-terminal \u03b1-helix appears to be associated with the cell-permeabilizing activity, additional functions (if any) of the extended N-terminal domain of XP remain to be studied.\n\nComparative genomic analysis suggests that the presence of a protein-coding ORF overlapping ORF2 is widespread in mammalian astroviruses. It appears to be almost ubiquitous in genogroups I, III and IV and is probably present in the single genogroup V sequence. It also appears to be present in various unassigned sequences and clades. ORFX frequently has a hydrophobic stretch that is often predicted to be a TM domain and in other cases may represent a non-canonical TM domain refractory to detection with standard TM-predicting software (as appears to be the case for HAstV1). While normally absent from genogroup II astroviruses, an ORFX appears to be present in one clade (herein referred to as IId), whereas in the clade referred to herein as IIc we predicted an ORFY in the \u22121 instead of +1 frame, and accessed via ribosomal frameshifting instead of leaky scanning. Given the sporadic appearance of an overlapping ORF across the genogroup II phylogeny, it seems likely that the genogroup II ORFX and ORFY evolved independently from ORFX in genogroups I, III and IV, and may also therefore have different functions. In contrast, these other ORFXs may or may not have a common ancestor and/or common function (it is unclear to what extent genogroups I, III and IV form a monophyletic group; Fig. S1, Fig. S2 ). The N-terminal ~70 aa of CP are dispensable for particle assembly and likely structurally disordered 20 and may therefore be evolutionarily fairly flexible. Thus, this region of ORF2 may be unusually tolerant to the coding constraints imposed by overlapping genes. Together with the high translation level of sgRNAs at later timepoints ( Fig. 2A) , and the ease with which 5\u2032 proximal ORFs can be expressed (requiring only leaky scanning rather than more complex expression mechanisms such as internal ribosome entry or ribosomal frameshifting 10 ), the 5\u2032 region of the sgRNA may be particularly well-suited to the evolution of an overlapping gene, consistent with multiple independent origins of ORFXs.\n\nDuring this study we also developed and characterized the first astrovirus replicon system. This will be of broad utility to the astrovirus research community. Astroviruses are one of the major . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

Nonetheless, despite their ubiquity and importance, astroviruses represent some of the least well-studied human viruses, partly because it has been difficult to establish efficient lab systems to study them. The replicon system developed herein will now permit detailed characterization of astrovirus replication and gene expression, and facilitate research into antiviral drugs.\n\nIn summary, using comparative genomic analyses we predicted a new gene in the Mamastrovirus genus; using ribosome profiling we demonstrated XP expression in HAstV1infected cells; and using a range of techniques we demonstrated the crucial role of XP in virus growth by promoting virus release, which is likely associated with its membranepermeabilizing activity. These findings add a new dimension to astrovirus molecular biology, with potential impacts for new therapeutics (e.g. compounds that block XP activity) and vaccine development (e.g. by inhibiting XP expression).\n\nMammalian astrovirus nucleotide sequences were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) on 26 July 2018. Patent sequence records and sequences with \u226520 ambiguous nucleotide codes (e.g. \"N\"s) were removed. For the full-genome analyses, only sequences covering all or nearly all of ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 were retained, giving 221 sequences (listed in Fig. S1 ). For the ORF2 analyses, only sequences covering all or nearly all of ORF2 were retained, giving 415 sequences (listed in Supplementary Dataset 1) . To identify the correct 5\u2032 end of ORF1b, we identified the AAAAAAC frameshift site. To identify the correct initiation site of ORF2, we identified the highly conserved sgRNA promoter nucleotides 29 and selected the next ORF2-frame AUG codon as the ORF2 start site in representative reference sequences; for the other sequences, the ORF2 start site was identified by amino acid alignment to one of the reference sequences. ORF1b and ORF2 sequences were extracted, translated to amino acid sequences, aligned with MUSCLE 30 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/661579 doi: bioRxiv preprint acid rate matrices, with 1,000,000 (221-sequence trees; Fig. S1 and Fig. S2 ) or 5,000,000 (415sequence tree; Fig. S4 ) generations, discarding the first 25% as burn-in (other parameters were left at defaults). Trees were visualized with FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).\n\nThe 221-sequence ORF1b tree was used to manually select clades (Fig. 1B) for full-genome SYNPLOT2 analyses (Fig. S3) . For the ORF2-only SYNPLOT2 analyses (Fig. S5) , we used a more objective method to select clades. Through an iterative procedure of clustering the 415 ORF2 sequences based on amino acid identity to a set of reference sequences, and selecting sequences distal from all reference sequences as new reference sequences, we arrived at a set identity to a reference, and only 20 have <55% identity; 82 and 4 sequences have >50% and >55% identity, respectively, to >1 references. Each non-reference sequence was then clustered with the reference sequence to which it has highest CP amino acid identity. This resulted in 16 singleton clusters and 26 multi-sequence clusters.\n\nSynonymous site conservation was analyzed with SYNPLOT2 9 . For the full-genome analyses we generated codon-respecting alignments using a procedure described previously 9 . In brief, each individual genome sequence was aligned to a reference sequence using code2aln version 1.2 32 . Genomes were then mapped to reference sequence coordinates by removing alignment positions that contained a gap character in the reference sequence, and these pairwise alignments were combined to give the multiple sequence alignment. To assess conservation at synonymous sites, the ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 coding regions were extracted from the alignment (with codons selected from the longer ORF in each overlap region), concatenated inframe, and the alignment analyzed with SYNPLOT2 using a 25-codon sliding window.\n\nConservation statistics were then mapped back to reference genome coordinates for plotting.\n\nFor the ORF2-only SYNPLOT2 analyses, any duplicate sequences were removed and the remaining ORF2 sequences in each clade were translated, aligned using MUSCLE as amino acid sequences, back-translated to codon-respecting nucleotide alignments, and the alignment analyzed with SYNPLOT2 as above. In contrast to the full-genome alignments, all alignment gaps were retained instead of mapping to a specific reference sequence coordinate system.

TM domains were predicted with Phobius (EMBL-EBI) 34 . The XP proteins of HAstVs 1-8 were additionally queried with TMHMM (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/; weak TM prediction for HAstV3, no TM predicted for other HAstVs) and SOSUI (http://harrier.nagahama-ibio.ac.jp/sosui/sosui_submit.html; no TMs predicted). XP secondary structures were predicted with RaptorX 35 . To search for potential homologues of XP, XPs from Fig. S6D, Fig. S7 and The infectious clone of HAstV1 (pAVIC1, GenBank accession number L23513.1) was described previously 16 . The reverse genetics procedure was compiled from several previously published approaches 16, 17 . Initial virus was recovered from T7 transcribed RNA using reverse transfection of Huh7.5.1 cells by Lipofectamine\u00ae 2000 (Invitrogen) (for virus rescue, see Fig. 3) or electroporation of BSR cells in PBS at 800 V and 25 \u00b5F using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser Xcell TM electroporation system (see Fig. 4 for an analysis of virus RNA in cells versus released particles). For virus passaging, the collected supernatant was treated with 10 \u00b5g/ml trypsin (Type IX, Sigma, #T0303) for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C, diluted 5 times with serum-free media, and used for infection of Caco2 cells. After 3 h of incubation, the virus containing media was replaced with serum free media containing 0.6 \u00b5g/ml trypsin, and cells were incubated for 48-72 h until appearance of CPE. After 3 freeze-thaw cycles, the viral stocks were aliquoted, frozen and stored at \u221270 \u00b0C. Viral stocks were titrated as previously described 35 , but using infrared detection readout, combined with automated LI-COR software-based quantification. \n\nFor mammalian expression of XP, the coding sequence of mCherry alone or HAstV1 XP fused to mCherry at either the N-or C-terminus was inserted into vector pCAG-PM 36 using AflII and PacI restriction sites. The resulting constructs -designated pCAG-mCherry, pCAG-XP-mCherry, and pCAG-mCherry-XP -were confirmed by sequencing.\n\nAll virus genome mutations (Fig. S11) were introduced using site-directed mutagenesis of pAVIC1 and confirmed by sequencing. The resulting plasmids were linearized with XhoI prior to T7 RNA transcription. To create the HAstV1 replicon system, the pAVIC1 infectious clone was left intact up to the end of ORFX, then followed by a foot and mouth disease virus 2A sequence and a Renilla luciferase (RLuc) sequence fused in either the ORF2 (pO2RL) or ORFX (pXRL) reading frame, followed by the last 624 nt of the virus genome and a poly-A tail (Fig.   4A ). All mutations were introduced from the corresponding pAVIC1 mutants using available restriction sites and all constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The resulting plasmids were linearized with XhoI prior to T7 RNA transcription. Each XP coding sequence was inserted into the pOPT plasmid with a C-or N-terminal Streptag as indicated (Fig. 6I) .

The cells were \n\nRibo-Seq analysis was performed as described previously 14 . Adaptor sequences were trimmed using the FASTX-Toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit) and trimmed reads shorter than 25 nt were discarded. Reads were mapped to host (Homo sapiens) and virus RNA using bowtie version 1 39 , with parameters -v 2 --best (i.e. maximum 2 mismatches, report best match).\n\nMapping was performed in the following order: host rRNA, virus RNA, host RefSeq mRNA, host non-coding RNA, host genome.\n\nTo normalize for library size, reads per million mapped reads (RPM) values were calculated using the sum of positive-sense virus and host RefSeq mRNA reads as the denominator. A +12 nt offset was applied to the RPF 5\u2032 end positions to give the approximate ribosomal P-site positions. To calculate the phasing and length distributions of host and virus RPFs, only RPFs whose 5\u2032 end (+12 nt offset) mapped between the 13th nucleotide from the beginning and the 18th nucleotide from the end of coding sequences (ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 for HAstV;\n\nRefSeq mRNAs for host) were counted, thus avoiding RPFs near initiation and termination sites. For Fig. S10 , the dual-coding region where ORFX overlaps ORF2 was also excluded.\n\nHistograms of host RPF positions (5\u2032 end +12 nt offset) relative to initiation and termination sites were derived from RPFs mapping to RefSeq mRNAs with annotated coding regions \u2265450 nt in length and with annotated 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs \u226560 nt in length. Virus ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 ribosome densities (used herein as a proxy for translation levels) were calculated by counting RPFs whose 5\u2032 end (+12 nt offset) mapped within the regions 101-2782, 2866-4311 .

At 48 hpe media samples were collected and centrifuged at 9,600 g for 5 min. The released virus samples were titrated on Caco2 cells as described above. For RT-qPCR analysis, a 150 \u00b5l aliquot of each sample was mixed with 4 \u00d7 10 6 Lysates from the above mentioned assays were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, using standard 12% SDS-PAGE to resolve mCherry and its XP-fusion variants, and precast Novex\u2122 10-20% tricine protein gels (Thermo Fisher) to resolve XPs and enterovirus 2B. Proteins were then transferred to 0.2 \u00b5m nitrocellulose membranes and blocked with 4% Marvel milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Immunoblotting of mCherry was performed using anti-mCherry antibody (Abcam, ab167453). A custom rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against XP peptide SNSGNRVSQDQNLQ (GenScript; only able to detect strongly overexpressed XP) and an anti-Strep mouse antibody (Abcam, ab184224) were used for detecting HAstV1 XP and Strep-tagged proteins, respectively. The following antibodies were used for cellular targets:\n\nanti-tubulin (Abcam, ab15568), anti-VDAC1 (Abcam, ab14734), and anti-LAMIN A+C (Abcam, ab133256).
