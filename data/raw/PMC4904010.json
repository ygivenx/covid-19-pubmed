{"title": "Etiologic Framework for the Study of Neurodegenerative Disorders as Well as Vascular and Metabolic Comorbidities on the Grounds of Shared Epidemiologic and Biologic Features", "body": "During the last two decades, protein aggregation at all organismal levels, from viruses to humans, has emerged from a neglected area of protein science to become a central issue in biology and biomedicine (Villar-Piqu\u00e9 and Ventura, 2012) The expanding knowledge in the field has particularly benefited our understanding of neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs). At the present time, it is widely acknowledged that templating (the basic mechanism generating protein misfolding, aggregation, deposit, and cell-to-cell transfer of certain pathogenic proteins) would be able to explain many features of the subclinical course and clinical manifestations of NDDs (Warren et al., 2013). Transcellular disease propagation of the pathogenic protein along existing anatomic structures (neural networks) would also explain the progression from the varied clinical patterns of NDDs (denoted as phenotypic heterogeneity) to a phenotypically converging, similar status, where a wide loss of cognitive, motor and sensory functions occur (Warren et al., 2013).\n\nIn a prior article, we selected 11 neurodegenerative conditions defined by clinical, neuropathological and biochemical features expressing different sets of single or combined misfolded protein deposits, and described life-course-related epidemiologic features (age-specific incidences and disease risk factors or disease progression predictors), thereby allowing for a meaningful, framed and unifying view of each disorder and its post-mortem biochemical signature (de Pedro-Cuesta et al., 2015). At a second step, we used a modified definition of the driver concept proposed by Sutherland to identify risk factors of specific proteins affecting different NDDs (Sutherland et al., 2011) and, having in mind the common amyloid nature of the pathogenic proteins involved, we identified selected traits of the epidemiology of sporadic, protein-associated, i.e., conformational, NDDs (sCNDD) useful for interpreting epidemiologic findings and relationships of the entities listed in Table 1 (Gunnarsson et al., 1996; Marmorstein et al., 2002; Peng et al., 2005; Irwin et al., 2013; Prusiner et al., 2015; de Pedro-Cuesta et al., 2016). In this third article we face a cumulative etiologic approach taking into account recent experimental data on transmissibility of multiple system atrophy (MSA; Prusiner et al., 2015).\n\nAccordingly, the purpose of this work was: (a) to complement and anchor the interpretation of each driver with selected results of clinical or animal-model research; (b) to propose etiologic theory pointing to basic mechanisms and specific causal hypotheses testable by study designs, for epidemiologic or experimental research; and (c) in line with recent initiatives, to propose public health developments.\n\nReferences for this review were identified by searches used in prior articles (de Pedro-Cuesta et al., 2015, 2016), by diverse searches of MEDLINE with limits from 1995 to September 2015, relevant for entities on study, and reference lists from relevant articles. Reports in MEDLINE in all languages, using each of the following diagnostic search terms combined with etiology, i.e., dementia, Creutzfeldt-Jakob syndrome, motor neurone disease (MND), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), fronto-temporal dementia (FTD), MSA, Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), Lewy body disease (LBD), Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), rapid progressive dementia, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and Huntington\u2019s disease (HD). There were no language restrictions. Driver specific reference lists were built. The final reference list consisted of a compendium of an approximately twice the size of full-text consultation work. As a literature review based proposal, the study does not require ethical assessment.\n\nEarly- and midlife proteinopathies and late-life sCNDD could be induced or modulated by early-age exposures, regardless of anatomic organs for contact and following a log-linear age-related function. Mimicking age-at-exposure related effects in animal models might be essential for supporting the biological plausibility of epidemiologic observations.\n\nThis driver might point to two distinct etiologic sCNDD forms differentiated by rapid progression, such as sCJD, ALS, and some sporadic rapidly-progressing neurodegenerative dementias (sRPNDds) with peak onset at age 70\u201375 years, and disease duration <3 years and late-life sCNDD with later age at onset and slower progression. When links with vascular lesions or vascular risk factors (VRF) are considered, sCJD, LBD, AD, and AMD would present and perhaps share vascular protein deposits: this would not, however, apply to FTD, PD and MSA, which are epidemiologically less closely related to VRF. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and vascular disease would be particularly seen in sCNDD (including sRPNDds) with incidence peaking after age 85 years. Prion strains and diverse entry routes would determine the large variation of age at onset in hGH-related atCJD, vCJD, and sCJD. High incidence of late-onset sCNDD might correspond to high attack rates from ubiquitous or widespread, tiny or low inoculum exposures and the opposite or a combination (low incidence, high inoculum exposures) for midlife-onset sCNDD, i.e., earlier-onset sCJD, ALS and earliest-onset sRPNDd may share prion-like entry or spread mechanisms.\n\nAPOE4 interacts with etiologic environmental factors for several disorders, i.e., sporadic AD, LBD, AMD, vascular dementia, atherosclerosis, or other forms of vascular disease such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, senile systemic angiopathy, and aortic aneurism. We also hypothesize that shared susceptibility genes for selected sCNDD and atherosclerosis mediate the effects of single pluripotential exposures, i.e., due to the same inoculum, or generated by the same mechanism. High-risk birth cohorts might share excess risk for several conformational disorders.\n\nThe view based on personal factors and the amyloid perspective on sCNDD suggests that a considerable part of the associations with late-life sCNDD, atherosclerosis, and T2DM might conceal confounding or reverse association (early manifestations of subclinical disease). This view, if confirmed, might complement the rationale for prevention of sCNDD, T2DM, and part of atherosclerosis, where measures for control of shared etiologic mechanisms underlying sCNDD, T2DM, and various angiopathies are proposed. Driver 4 contribution to theory is summarized as a potential switch of the roles attributed to a direct relationship between risk factors and sCNDD in Figure 2, to those outlined in Figure 3. Most of these associations are in part interpreted as confounding or reverse causality, and direct causality is assigned to a higher level shared by defined amyloid disorders.\n\nThe hypothesis of a surgical (and blood-transfusion-related) risk of sCJD is based on a few reports on CJD among patients exposed to neurosurgical instruments used on a patient with subclinical or clinically manifested CJD, and on observations from a register-based population case-control study on routine hospital surgery followed by a lag of over 20 years, with retina surgery being associated with sCJD, on the basis of three cases with a mean latency of 11 years (de Pedro-Cuesta et al., 2011). Aside from one Italian study (Puopolo et al., 2011), however, confounding by surgically-linked blood transfusion was not controlled for, and no positive association between neurosurgical procedures and CJD has been shown. Inconsistent findings for risk from blood transfusion have been reported.\n\nOn the basis of register-based epidemiologic studies on surgical risk of sCJD suggesting age-related susceptibility, the suggested associations of ALS and incidence peaking at a similar age, we propose that sCJD, ALS and some sRPNDds and MSA with onset below age 75\u201379 years are transmitted by routine surgery and transfusion of blood or blood derivatives at juvenile age.\n\nThe association between age at first major whooping cough outbreak (MWCO) and PD constitutes an important observation in Iceland, reinforced by negative results for birth-cohort effects in continental populations. Considered as a quasi-experiment, it is consistent with the high prevalence and incidence of PD among the Faroe Islanders and Greenland Inuit (Wermuth et al., 2002, 2008). The excess risk of PD as a long-term biological effect of BP infection was attributed to Pertussis toxin (de Pedro-Cuesta et al., 1996). Since PD shares protein deposits (for a review see Sutherland et al., 2011 ) with MSA, LBD, and AD, BP infection in genetically susceptible young individuals might be proposed as an environmental driver for late-life sCNDD such as MSA, PD, LBD, AD, and AMD.\n\nHuman-adapted agents integrating human genome such as BP able to generate natural protein fibrils might generate different late-life sCNDD by pluripotential mechanisms in accordance with the individual susceptibility. BP may act through nasal and gastrointestinal epithelia. Systemic action across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and vascular endothelium might be plausible.\n\nFigure 3 depicts a hypothetical etiologic scenario modified from Figure 2, where different amyloid deposits shared by sCNDD, vascular disorders and a number of endocrine entities or functions, determine late-life human pathology as a result of ER stressors or poor UPR. As a complement, some endocrine factors of a different origin (i.e., oophorectomy or specific estrogen therapies) might also constitute risk factors for conformational disorders.\n\nCurli from some human-adapted pathogens correspond to multiple potentially infective natural misfolded protein fibrils resulting from horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from agents well adapted to the human host, acting at young ages as pluripotential agents facilitating invasion, particularly during inflammatory conditions (infections). These mechanisms may be shared by some angiopathies and T2DM exhibiting a similar driver, as well as by multiple similar pathogenic processes among humans. An essential condition for bacterial agents being candidates for HGT is that they themselves or their close ancestors must have been well adapted to human hosts by integrating pathogenic DNA from different niches (gingival, nasal, respiratory mucosae or gut epithelium, and other). In essence, infection by E. coli or coexistent with E. coli as a part of the intestinal microbiome, and other well adapted human hosts carrying pathogenic human genetic material and natural protein fibrils might induce diverse sCNDD, T2DM, and atherosclerosis, following an age-at-infection pattern.\n\nWe propose that sCNDD, T2DM, a relevant proportion of atherosclerosis, as well as other late-life endocrine disorders resulting in andropause and estrogen deficit, constitute organ-limited amyloid disorders, where conformational mimicry leads to misfolding of a limited number of proteins such as PrP, Langerhans Islet peptide, amyloid beta (A\u03b2), tau, \u03b1-synuclein, SOD1, FTP-43, medin, TTR, and wild-type EFMP1 (Marmorstein et al., 2002).\n\nInitial biological mechanisms are rooted in human genomics. Eukaryotic DNA fragments implicated in genetic forms of late-life NDDs [mainly AP and PD] incorporated in the genome of potential commensal, symbiotic, and pathogenic microorganisms present in the human reservoir, i.e., E. coli and BP, constitute sequences resulting in pluripotential protein fibrils that are infective via the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract or by B lymphocyte presentation. Some amyloid proteins such as APrP may additionally act parenterally by contact with human misfolded protein fibrils, generating rapid course sCNDD, such as sCJD, ALS, and some sRPNDds. Disease progression and spread through the central nervous system would follow reported anatomic patterns. Early vascular-wall lesions determine the first steps in atherosclerotic plaque formation. Small-vessel and neuronal lesions frequently coexist. The same pathogenic mechanisms may underlie some endocrine disorders. Multiple degenerative disorders may share conformational pathophysiologic mechanisms linked to different, as yet unknown, UPR. Latency intervals might frequently encompass decades.\n\nsCNDD epidemiologic patterns point to a high susceptibility in late-infancy and at juvenile ages. Risk and disease spread can be determined by the same factors, which constitute risk factors or biomarkers of disease progression, or both. ER stressors and UPR-related pathology, particularly late in life, may display complex relationships, i.e., as seen for VRF, late-life sCNDD, atherosclerosis, and T2DM. Incorporation of drivers 5,6, and 7 in the model seen in Figure 3, would result in a comprehensive etiologic model presented in Figure 4.\n\nThe present view of sCNDD reinforces the notion of a set of neurodegenerative processes in which continuity as a form of overlap, and competition\u2014earlier and more lethal NDDs, T2DM or vascular disease removing persons at high risk of other less lethal NDDs\u2014act on the age axis. Equivalent, observational, proof-of-principle studies would correspond to investigations aimed at confirming that NDDs which are clinically and epidemiologically close by median age at onset, disease duration, age-specific normalized incidence profile and genetic type of change, share environmental risk factors. The study of exposures in the first two decades of life would require approaches separated from that of the same exposures at later ages, with latency analyses being needed in both instances. Simultaneous approaches including two or more NDDs may be advantageous. Identification of selected populations by criteria targeted at optimizing ascertainment of both exposure and outcome, plus identification of randomly selected population controls are paramount.\n\nImplications of the driver notion from sCNDD epidemiology in experimental research appear to be less direct than in cohort alignment, requiring translation to biological inference. Different animal models have been developed to address various sCNDD, cardiovascular disease complications, and T2DM. Models in mice targeting AD, tauopathies, and ALS are mainly based on transgenic methodologies, with those for PD and synucleinopathies being both toxic and transgenic. Animal models may exhibit a number of important limitations, mimicking phenotypic variants of AD and other sCNDD1. The validity of human drivers, i.e., age-at-exposure related susceptibility, may be tested in toxic animal models of NDD.\n\nIn general, little attention has been paid to disease-non-specific animal models based on seeding of naturally produced amyloid fibrils, such as those generated by Sup35 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and curli from E. coli which exert amyloid-accelerating influences in experimental murine amyloidosis (Lundmark et al., 2005). In contrast, the validity of traditional approaches is extensively considered in disease-oriented media. A human driver-1-related, ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mouse model, is that which best fits the study of arteriosclerosis and diabetes-accelerated arteriosclerosis (Zaragoza et al., 2011). A similar feature displays the male-mouse castration model of PD (Khasnavis et al., 2013). It would appear that the most valid NDD models are the genetically-modified, cell and animal models of AD, PD, FTD, and ALS, all of which are based on the mutations described in the familial NDD forms2. A research goal in the experimental model context might be the identification of key elements underlying an environmentally modified, potential effect of human genes, similar to that shown by laboratory experiments on NDDs, T2DM and atherosclerosis with traditional models.\n\nSpecific attempts to combine population and clinical cohorts/registries able to trace human events determining current disease might be a priority, particularly if: (a) such events can be identified by drivers; and (b) agents, similar to natural fibrils used in seeding models reproducing amyloid disease including NDDs, can be identified from historical sources, banks or libraries.\n\nTraditionally, neuroepidemiologists have been used to working with surveys or cohorts geographically settled close to their residence. As a novelty, assessment and alignment of cohorts for specific research purposes might be done for the first time with a high number of population or clinical cohorts gathered and offered as a potentially shared research resource3. On the basis of best clinical and epidemiologic practice, research into this avenue mighty advantageously address the etiology of and risk factors for sporadic forms of CJD, sRPNDd, MND, MSA, LBD, FTD, PD, AD, and AMD. This would require work on populations exposed to biological environments in specific conditions and with exposures measured under extremely favorable conditions for epidemiologic comparisons pertaining to registration and the time lag after exposure. Only a few populations in the world would allow for such field studies. To avoid misclassification of outcomes (subclinically affected controls), studies on the very old should be extremely cautious.\n\nPossible factors to be weighted when considering favorable research environments are:\n\nResearch of this nature might encompass:\n\nJdP-C conceived and coordinated the study, analyzed literature, wrote first manuscript version.
