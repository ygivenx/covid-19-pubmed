{"title": "The final size of a SARS epidemic model without quarantine", "body": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first recognized as a global threat in mid-March 2003. The first known cases and the last case of SARS occurred in November 2002 and in July 2003. The international spread of SARS resulted in 8098 SARS cases in 26 countries, with 774 deaths [6] . It is believed that the transmission of SARS can be effectively controlled by adhering to basic public health measures-rapid case detection, case isolation, contact tracing, good infection control (hand-washing and the use of personal protective equipment), and quarantine. Hsu and Hsieh [3] had modeled the SARS outbreak in Taiwan for year 2003 using the general models that include two different levels of quarantines, level A for those who were suspected of having close contact with a suspected SARS case and level B for those who traveled from affected areas after April 28, 2003. Their model equations are as follows: \n\nwhere \u03bb function is the rate of incidence of infection and is given by\n\n= \u03b2c 1 + a(P + R + D)\n\nThe variables at time t are defined as the following:\n\nS-the number of susceptible individuals. E-the number of infected asymptomatic persons not under any quarantine. Q A -the number of infected asymptomatic persons under level A quarantine. Q B -the number of imported asymptomatic infected persons. I -the number of infective persons with onset of symptoms but not isolated or quarantined. P -the number of isolated probable SARS cases. D-the cumulative number of SARS deaths. R-the cumulative number of discharged SARS patients.\n\nFor this model, the time unit is in days. The initial conditions are S(0) = S 0 > 0,\n\nSince the duration of the outbreak was a short time, the total population is assumed to be constant:\n\nThe basic assumptions for the model are the following:\n\n(1) A SARS-infective person is infective after onset of symptoms.\n\n(2) A quarantined person is quarantined without symptoms (hence are not infective), becoming infective with reduced contact rates due to quarantine, and is isolated upon diagnosis. (3) An infective person can infect others unless isolated as probable case with reduced contact rates depending on the effectiveness of isolation. (4) A probable case is removed from isolation either by death or discharge. (5) As people's behavior change caused by public response to the outbreak, the contact rate decreases with the increasing cumulated number of probable cases, deaths, and the removed.\n\n(6) Homogeneous mixing with quarantine-adjusted incidence is assumed. (7) Quarantine for level A is proportional to the number of infected asymptomatic persons.\n\n(8) Imported cases are a function of time (Q(t) = 0, 1, or 2).\n\nThe parameters are defined as follows:\n\n\u03b2-the average number of susceptible individuals infected by one infective individual per effective contact per day. c-the per-capita effective contact number in the absence of an outbreak. a-the effect of behavior change in reduction of contact due to cumulative numbers of probable cases, deaths, and the removed. \u03b1 A , \u03b1 B , or \u03b1 P -the proportional reduction in infectivity of quarantined persons due to levels A, B quarantine (before isolation) and probable cases, respectively. \u03bc-the progression rate to onset of symptoms. q 1 -the proportion of recruitment of asymptomatic infected persons for level A quarantine. \u03b3 1 , \u03b3 2 -the isolation rates of Q A and Q B , respectively. \u03b3 3 -the isolation rate of infectives not under quarantine. \u03c3 1 , \u03c3 2 -the respective discharged rate of infective cases and isolated probable cases. \u03c1 1 , \u03c1 2 -the respective fatality rate of infective cases and isolated probable SARS patient.\n\nFor the general model of SARS (1), Hsu and Hsieh had derived the basic reproduction number and the full description of its dynamics was provided in [3] .\n\nFor the worse case scenario when there are no quarantines and the probable cases are not isolated, i.e., \u03b1 A = \u03b1 B = \u03b1 P = 0, then the model (1) becomes the following SARS model without quarantine [3] :\n\nHsu and Hsieh [3] had done some analysis for this model. We will summarize their results. The equilibrium with the susceptible present for the system in (S, E, I, P , R, D) is\n\nThe basic reproduction number R 0 for this model is\n\nIf R 0 < 1, the equilibrium with the susceptible present is locally asymptotically stable and if R 0 > 1, unstable. When S * = 0 in R 0 , we define\n\nNote that 0 < \u03c8 R 0 . If \u03c8 > 1, then R 0 > 1 and the disease prevails. We will show that this is indeed the case. When \u03c8 > 1, the final size S \u221e of the susceptible becomes zero. Eventually, everyone will be infected and either dies or recovers. Hsu and Hsieh [3] had obtained the following results relating to the parameter \u03c8 .\n\nTheorem 1. For the SARS model without quarantine (2) , the solutions have the following asymptotic properties:\n\nTheorem 2. Consider system (2) . The parameter \u03c8 is defined as in (3).\n\nThe above two theorems state that the asymptotic dynamics are actually global so that we may write the equilibrium with the susceptible present or the equilibrium without the susceptible present to be (S \u221e , 0, 0, 0, R \u221e , D \u221e ) and (0, 0, 0, 0, R \u221e , D \u221e ) depending on the parameter \u03c8 . We will show that although \u03c8 is not a basic reproductive number, it acts like one. If \u03c8 > 1, the disease will prevail. When \u03c8 > 1, the final size S \u221e of the susceptible becomes zero. Eventually, everyone will be infected and either dies or recovers. In the following section, we will give details of the finding of the relation among S 0 , S \u221e , and \u03c8 .\n\nIn the classical Kermack-Mckendric SIR model, the asymptotic state or the final size S \u221e satisfies a transcendental equation [4, 5] , so does S \u221e obtained in system (2). Diekmann et al. [1] also found the final size of epidemics in a closed population. Their model is described by a nonlinear Volterra integral equation of convolution type, just as the general Kermack-McKendrick model. Similar results that relate the final size and the basic reproductive number R 0 can also be found in the book by Diekmann and Heesterbeek [2] .\n\nWe can integrate the equations of P , R, and D in (2) from t = 0 to \u221e. Since P (\u221e) = 0, we have\n\nand\n\nBy substituting (4) into (5) and (6), we obtain\n\nThen we have R \u221e D \u221e = r.\n\nLet V = S + E + I . Then P + R + D = N \u2212 V , and system (2) can be simplified so that the two equations for S and V are\n\nThen we have dS dV = \u03b2c a(N \u2212 V ) ) .\n\nApplying the method of separation of variables and integrating both sides of the equation from t = 0 leads to\n\nwhere \u03c8 is defined as in (3). Since V 0 = S 0 + E 0 + I 0 = N , and V \u221e = S \u221e , S \u221e satisfies the following:\n\nWe can show that the equation in x,\n\nhas only two roots at x = 0 and x = S \u221e \u2208 (0, S 0 ) when \u03c8 < 1, as seen in Fig. 1 . (10)\n\nSo f is convex and hence intersects each chord twice. When x 0, Eq. (10) has a root in (0, S 0 ) and a root in (S 0 , \u221e) so cannot have any more positive roots. The statement (i) follows in this case.\n\n(ii) \u03c8 1. The roots of this equation are x = 0 and the roots of (10). But for x \u2208 (0, S 0 ],\n\nThe statement (ii) follows. 2\n\nIn case (i) of Theorem 2, since S \u221e + R \u221e + D \u221e = N , and R \u221e and D \u221e satisfy R \u221e /D \u221e = r, we can find all three values, S \u221e , R \u221e , and D \u221e . In case (ii) of Theorem 2, all solutions approach the equilibrium (0, 0, 0, 0, R \u221e , D \u221e ), that is to say that eventually everyone gets infected and recovers or dies. Since R \u221e + D \u221e = N , it is also easy to find R \u221e and D \u221e . Therefore, we have the following results. Theorem 4. Consider system (2) . The parameters \u03c8 and r are defined as in (3) and (7) , respectively.\n\n(i) If \u03c8 < 1, then\n\n(ii) If \u03c8 > 1, then\n\nIf \u03c8 < 1, then S \u221e > 0, we can show that S \u221e decreases as the parameter \u03c8 increases, dS \u221e /d\u03c8 < 0. We can also show that S \u221e increases as the parameter a increases or as S 0 increases. That is, we can show that dS \u221e /da > 0 and dS \u221e /dS 0 > 0. Let\n\nNote that if \u03c8 < 1, we have 0 < S \u221e < N, so that 0 < g < 1. We will need the following lemma.\n\nIf \u03c8 < 1, then\n\nProof. From Eq. (10), we know that the function f = S (0, S 0 ) . Therefore,\n\ni.e.,\n\nUsing Eq. (8), we obtain\n\nWhen \u03c8 < 1, S \u221e > 0. If we consider S \u221e as a function of \u03c8 , then S \u221e is a decreasing function.\n\nTheorem 5. Consider Eq. (8). Let \u03c8 < 1 and S \u221e be a function of the parameter \u03c8 . Then\n\nProof. Let S \u221e = S \u221e (\u03c8) and g = g(\u03c8) be defined as in (11). Then we have\n\n.\n\nEquation (8) is now\n\nDifferentiating the equation with respect to the parameter \u03c8 yields\n\nApplying g /g in (12) and simplifying, we have\n\ni.e.,\n\nThe right side of the equation is negative because 0 < g(\u03c8) < 1. By Lemma 1, we have\n\nThe result in this theorem does not surprise us, since we have mentioned in the introduction that the parameter \u03c8 is acting like a basic reproductive number. Therefore, increasing \u03c8 should also increase the epidemic and hence it decreases the final size of the susceptible. Similarly, the following theorem says that S \u221e increases with the initial number of the susceptible. Proof. Assume that S \u221e is a function of S 0 , then g = g(S 0 ). Differentiating Eq. (8) with respect to S 0 yields\n\nThe last equation comes from substituting Eq. (8) into the right-hand side. Therefore, we have\n\nIn the SARS model (2), the parameter a describes the effect of behavior change in reduction of contact due to the cumulative number of probable cases. If a increases, number of contacts will be reduced, the epidemic will be not as severe, and so the final size of the susceptible S \u221e increases. The result is the following theorem.\n\nTheorem 7. Consider Eq. (8). Let \u03c8 < 1 and S \u221e be a function of the parameter a. Then\n\nProof. Let S \u221e = S \u221e (a), \u03c8 = \u03c8(a), and g = g(a). Then\n\nDifferentiating the equation with respect to the parameter a yields\n\nSubstitute g (a)/g(a) into the above equation and rearrange. We have\n\nIf we can show that the right-hand side of the above equation is positive, and since by Lemma 1, the factor in front of S \u221e (a) is positive, then we should obtain the result that S \u221e (a) > 0. Therefore, we need to show that\n\ni.e.,\n\nLet\n\nThen h(0+) = \u2212\u221e and h(N ) = 0. We can show that\n\nx(1 + aN \u2212 ax) 2 > 0, for all x \u2208 (0, N).\n\nThe function h(x) is increasing on (0, N) from \u2212\u221e to 0, and therefore h(S \u221e ) < 0 which is the inequality (13). 2\n\nWe consider the final size of a SARS epidemic model without quarantine. Our model is not an integral equations model, unlike other papers [1, 4, 5] of similar results which describe the epidemics using integral equations.\n\nWe use an \"acting basic reproductive number\" \u03c8 to predict the final size of the epidemics, and there is a relation among the final size of the susceptible S \u221e , the initial susceptible S 0 , and the parameter \u03c8 . We show that if \u03c8 > 1, the disease stays in the population until all population is infected and recovers or dies. If \u03c8 < 1, then the final size of the susceptible is greater than zero, S \u221e > 0. S \u221e decreases with the parameter \u03c8 , increases with the initial size of the susceptible S 0 , and increases with the parameter a which is the measure of the effect of behavior change in reduction of contact due to the cumulation number or probable cases."}
