{"title": "Infl uenza Virus Infection in Nonhuman Primates", "body": "W orldwide, infections with infl uenza A viruses are associated with substantial illness and death among mammals and birds. Public health and research have placed major focus on understanding the pathogenicity of different infl uenza virus strains and characterizing new infl uenza vaccines. Nonhuman primates (NHPs), including macaques, have become popular experimental models for studying the pathogenesis and immunology of seasonal and emerging infl uenza viruses. NHPs readily seroconvert after experimental inoculation with seasonal infl uenza virus and have been used to test candidate vaccines for strains of human and avian origin. Like humans, macaques infected with infl uenza virus exhibit fever, malaise, nasal discharge, and nonproductive cough; virus replication can be detected in the nasal passages and respiratory tract (1, 2) . However, whether NHPs are infected with infl uenza viruses in nature remains unknown.\n\nOver the past decade, we have focused on the role of pet and performing monkeys in disease transmission throughout Asia. Commonly trapped in the wild, these monkeys might be sold at wet markets, the putative source of several zoonotic outbreaks (3), where they might be caged next to any number of animal species (Figure 1 , panel A) (4). Pet and performing monkeys are likely conduits for cross-species transmission of respiratory pathogens like infl uenza viruses because of their close and long-term contact with their owners, audiences, domestic animals, wild animals, and birds ( Figure 1, panel B) (5) . However, the breadth and diversity of this interface presents a challenge for monitoring the emergence of infectious diseases. We have approached this challenge by conducting longitudinal studies at several sites and collecting biological samples and behavioral data representing various contexts of human-NHP contact (4-7). We used these historical and newly acquired samples, representing various countries and contexts of human-macaque contact, to determine whether NHPs are infected with infl uenza viruses in nature.\n\nAs part of our decade-long longitudinal studies, \u2248200 serum samples were collected from macaques. These included pet macaques (Macaca nigra, M. nigrescens, M. hecki) from Sulawesi, Indonesia; performing macaques from Java, Indonesia (M. fascicularis) and from Bangladesh (M. mulatta); M. fascicularis macaques from the Bukit Timah and Central Catchment Nature Reserves in Singapore, where they freely interact with wild avian fauna and visitors (occasionally entering residential areas) (7); M. sylvanus macaques from the Upper Rock Nature Reserve in Gibraltar, where international tourists frequently use food to entice the macaques to climb about their heads and shoulders (6) ; and free-ranging macaques (M. fascicularis and M. nemestrina) at temple shrines or M. fascicularis macaques that range throughout a wildlife rescue center and nearby villages in Cambodia ( Figure 2 ). Serum was collected and stored as described (8) . All samples were stored on cold packs in the fi eld and transferred to dry ice for shipment to the United States, where they were then stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\n\nFor initial screening for antibodies against infl uenza virus, serum samples were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme as described (9) and tested by using a multispecies Infl uenza A Virus NP Antibody Inhibition Test (Virusys Corporation, Taneytown, MD, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. ELISA results indicated nucleocapsid protein antibodies against infl uenza in samples from macaques from Cambodia (29.2%), Singapore (16.7%), Sulawesi (16.1%), Bangladesh (13.3%), and Java (6.0%) ( Table 1) . Antibodies were detected in animals 1-10 years of age at the time of sampling. No infl uenza virusspecifi c antibodies were detected from the 73 total samples from Gibraltar, perhaps because persons with infl uenza virus infection infrequently travel to the Upper Rock Reserve (healthy-visitor effect) (10) or perhaps because monkeys from Gibraltar are less susceptible to infection. Seroprevalence of antibodies against infl uenza A virus, by site and collection year, human and NHP population densities, and prevalence of avian infl uenza viruses are shown in Figure 2 .\n\nSerum samples that were positive by ELISA were also screened by hemagglutination-inhibition assay as described (9) . Based on the year and location of NHP sample collection, the estimated ages of the NHPs at the time of sample collection, and the presence of avian H5 and H9 infl uenza viruses in many of these countries during the sampling period (11) (12) (13) , a panel of human vaccine strains and avian infl uenza virus strains was used in the hemagglutination-inhibition assay. Although not all ELISA-positive serum samples could be subtyped, antibodies against seasonal subtype H1N1 and H3N2 infl uenza A strains were detected from macaques in Bangladesh, Singapore, Java, and Sulawesi (Table 2) . Of the performing macaques in Bangladesh, 2 had antibodies against A/chicken/Bangladesh/5473/2010, a strain of G1 clade subtype H9N2 avian infl uenza virus. Subtype H9N2 infl uenza viruses are prevalent in poultry in Bangladesh (14) and have been detected in humans (12) . We did not detect antibodies against highly pathogenic avian infl uenza subtype H5 viruses, which might not be surprising given our relatively small sample size (Table 2) . Also given the small sample size, we were unable to perform microneutralization studies, which would be useful to perform with future samples.\n\nIn 2011, to determine whether any macaques were actively infected with infl uenza virus, we collected oral swabs from 48 monkeys in Cambodia to test for infl uenza virus by real-time reverse transcription PCR as described (8) . In brief, the inside of the anesthetized and immobilized monkeys' mouths (cheeks, tongue, and gums) were swabbed. Swabs were immediately placed into viral transport media, stored, and shipped as previously described. RNA was isolated by using an Ambion MagMAX-96 AI/ND Viral RNA Isolation Kit (Life Technologies Corporation, Grand Island, NY, USA) on a Kingfi sher Flex system (Thermo Fisher Scientifi c, Waltham, MA, USA). Viral RNA was analyzed in a Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System and a C1000 Thermocycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) with TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and the InfA primer/ probe sets as described (15) . Of the 48 respiratory samples, 1 (2.1%) was positive for infl uenza virus; cycle threshold value was 38 (limit of detection is 40). Attempts to amplify longer PCR fragments of matrix, hemagglutinin, or neuraminidase genes or to isolate the virus by blind passage in embryonated chicken eggs or MDCK cells were unsuccessful.\n\nOur results indicate that NHPs that have contact with humans can be naturally infected with seasonal endemic human infl uenza viruses and with emerging pandemicrisk avian infl uenza viruses. We found serologic evidence of infection in several countries, contexts, and macaque species. Preliminary real-time reverse transcription PCR results also pointed to the presence of virus in a buccal swab from an adult macaque from Cambodia, indicating active infection at the time of sampling. On the basis of results from this study, it seems that pet, performing, and free-ranging macaques are susceptible to infl uenza virus infection. Given the close relationship between humans and NHPs in areas of the world where avian and human infl uenza viruses cocirculate, further surveillance of these populations is warranted. The ability to detect and eventually isolate strains of infl uenza virus currently infecting NHPs and humans at the animal-human interface is paramount to understanding how NHP-human interactions can affect the genetics, transmission, and public health risk for infection with infl uenza A viruses."}
