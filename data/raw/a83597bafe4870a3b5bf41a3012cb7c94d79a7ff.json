{"title": "", "body": "Canadian provinces. In 2002, WNV encephalitis afflicted 4,161 people and claimed 284 lives in the largest outbreak of mosquito-borne encephalitis recorded in the Western Hemisphere (CDC 2003) . WNV also performed a dazzling array of new tricks, with infection occurring via blood transfusions, organ transplants, pregnancy, and probably breast milk.\n\nOf greatest concern, however, WNV has spread to 230 species of animals, including 138 species of birds. WNV is spreading in the Caribbean and Central America, and is a leading suspect in the recent 10-fold drop of migratory song birds in Costa Rica (Causey D. Personal communication). Raptors have died from WNV, though population-level impacts are unknown. Rodents are consumed by birds of prey, and if unchecked, their legions can become prolific consumers of stored and growing grains and purveyors of pests and pathogens.\n\nDiseases of livestock and crops have been particularly costly. The appearance of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (\"mad cow\") disease in the United Kingdom in the 1990s and new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans had major health, political, and economic impacts (Newcomb 2003) . When followed by foot and mouth disease and large-scale flooding in 2001, the blow to the British economy ($30 billion) and psyche were palpable.\n\nCrops face growing threats from extremes of weather and from pests, pathogens, and weeds (Rosenzweig et al. 2001 ). Cassava mosaic virus, one of the family of geminiviruses carried by white flies (Anderson and Morales 1993) , has caused enormous losses of cassava (manioc, yucca, or tapioca) in sub-Saharan Africa, where it is a staple in the diet of millions.\n\nPresently, 35-42% of growing and stored crops are lost to pests, pathogens, and weeds annually, amounting to losses of $244 billion worldwide annually (Pimental 1997) . Increased climate variability could substantially alter future food security and global nutrition (Rosenzweig and Hillel 1998) .\n\nHabitat is also being subjected to the dual threats of climate change and emerging infectious diseases. In Alaska, spruce bark beetles have denuded 4 million acres of conifers on the Kenai Peninsula, as warming allows the beetles time for an extra generation each year (Kerlin 2002) . Dead stands are then vulnerable to fire. In California, several species of trees are infected with Phytophthora, a fungus related to the one responsible for the Irish potato famine (Davidson et al. 2003) . Extreme weather weakens the hosts and emboldens the agents.\n\nOaks in New Orleans, Louisiana, are bristling with termites (CNN 1997), as killing frosts became less frequent in the 1990s. New England hemlock trees are under assault from the woolly adelgid, an aphidlike insect that has migrated northward with warmer winters (Foster D. Personal communication).\n\nIn the coastal zone-the intersection of land, sea, and air-emerging diseases and algal toxins are affecting invertebrates, shellfish, finfish, shorebirds, and marine mammals (Harvell et al. 1999; Health, Ecological and Economic Dimensions of Global Change 1998) . Of greatest concern are diseases of seagrasses and coral; these ancient habitats are nurseries for mobile marine species and birds, and they protect shorelines from saline intrusion, breaking waves, and storms. Corals are already endangered, as high sea surface temperatures have caused widespread bleaching-the most dramatic biological sign of global warming."}
