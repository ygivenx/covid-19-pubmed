{"title": "Characterization of a protein tyrosine phosphatase as a host factor promoting baculovirus replication in silkworm, Bombyx mori", "body": "Reversible protein tyrosine phosphorylation provides a potent and versatile mechanism for regulating various physiological processes in eukaryotic cells. Protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), which catalyze the transfer of phosphoryl group to tyrosine residues, and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), which remove phosphate moiety from phosphotyrosine residues, work together to modulate signaling pathways. In some cases, PTPs play a dominate role in shaping the spatio-temporal dynamics of protein tyrosine phosphorylation network, making it a pivotal target for functional manipulation (Mustelin et al., 2005) . Although the study of PTPs lagged behind of PTKs for historical reasons and technical difficulties, a large number of PTPs have been discovered in recent years, paralleling PTKs in sequence diversity and functional complexity (Alonso et al., 2004) . Despite a minority reported to be Asp-based PTPs, all others possess at least one signature motif, [I/V] HCX 5 R[S/T] and share a Cys-based catalytic mechanism. Some PTPs serve as pTyr-specific enzymes, others can also dephosphorylate Ser/Thr residues, thus they are operationally defined as dual specificity phosphatase (DUSP) . And the ability of removing phosphate group from phospholipid or RNA is also reported in some DUSPs (Tonks, 2013) .\n\nIntriguingly, numerous hostevirus interactions are based on the interplay of PTKs and PTPs as revealed by studies on vertebrates and invertebrates (Devasthanam, 2014; Kingsolver et al., 2013) . Mounting a potent immune response to invading virus relies on proper phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of signaling molecules in host cells. Reciprocally, virus develops strategies to utilize or disrupt this regulatory mechanism for survival and transmission. For instance, in vitro studies using mammalian cell lines demonstrated that DUSP1, which dephosphorylates MAPKs, facilitates the infection of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (Choi et al., 2015; Liao et al., 2011) . And congenital human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) can take advantage of CDC25, a cell cycle regulator to promote viral replication (Fu et al., 2015) . However, due to the lack of systematic analysis of insect PTPs and distinct antiviral mechanism that insect may take, few surveys reported the relevance of insect PTPs to antiviral immune response.\n\nSome virus also encode PTPs, which have been hypothesized or demonstrated to function as virulence factors that impair host immune response or other functions (Heneberg, 2012; Peters et al., 2002; Provost et al., 2004) . The best-known example in insect is the expression of several bracovirus-encoded PTPs in lepidopteran hosts promoted the apoptosis of granulocytes and inhibited spreading and phagocytosis of plasmatocytes, therefore facilitating parasitoid development (Ibrahim et al., 2007; Ibrahim and Kim, 2008; Pruijssers and Strand, 2007) . Interestingly, phylogenic analysis showed that those PTP genes were acquired from braconid genome and experienced complex evolutionary change Serbielle et al., 2012) . Recent studies on another subset of insect virus identified a nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV)-encoded PTP, which was presumably acquired from a lepidopteran host by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) as an essential factor to induce an enhanced locomotory activity (ELA) in host caterpillars (Kamita et al., 2005; van Houte et al., 2012) . And NPV ptp deletion mutant lost its ability to manipulate its host behavior. Surprisingly, later study found BmNPV PTP functions as a virus-associated structural protein rather than as an enzyme in regard to the induction of ELA, although it still maintains the catalytic activity (Katsuma et al., 2012) . Moreover, BmNPV ptp deletion mutant had reduced progeny production in silkworm larvae and showed a delay in late gene expression in cell lines. An earlier study identified a BmNPV ptp homolog encoded by Autographa californica multicapsid NPV (AcMNPV) as a dual phosphatase containing RNA 5'-triphosphatase activity which is implicated in processing of viral late mRNAs (Takagi et al., 1998) . In contrast to BmNPV ptp mutant, AcMNPV ptp mutant seems to have no defect in replication in insect larvae, but partially defect in occluded virus production in a cell-specific manner (Li and Miller, 1995) .\n\nGiven that HGT between host and pathogen has been proposed to be an important mechanism to increase pathogen survival and propagation (de la Casa-Esperon, 2012), it is interesting to trace back the function of the host copies to better understand the interaction between the host and pathogen. In the present study, we first analyzed BmPTP-h based on its functional categorization, then we investigated the immune-regulatory role it would play under the challenge of BmNPV in vitro and in vivo. We found that it increased expression level after viral infection and benefited viral replication. Our result provides complementary insights into the molecular machinery exploited by insect virus which could be pursued for antiviral strategy.\n\nBased on the annotated information of Bombyx mori comprehensive gene sets (http://sgp.dna.affrc.go.jp/ComprehensiveGeneSet/), sequence of protein predicted to possess tyrosine phosphatase domain was extracted and analyzed by online software SMART (http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/). Protein that contains the PTP signature motif (CX 5 R) was then used as the query in BLASTP search against NCBI sequence repository to identify their paralogs. B. mori PTPs were classified into subfamilies according to their orthologous PTPs in human and fruit fly (Alonso et al., 2004; Hatzihristidis et al., 2015) .\n\nSilkworm larvae (DaZao P50 strain) were reared on fresh mulberry leaves at 25 C and relative humidity of 80%. BmE cells were maintained at 27 C in Grace medium (Gibco, UK) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone, USA). Wide-type BmNPV (Guangdong strain, China) and recombinant BmNPV-GFP (courtesy of Dr. Xiaofeng Wu, Zhejiang University, China) were propagated in BmE cells and silkworm larvae following the standard procedure. Viral titer were determined by plaque assay in BmE cells (Katsuma et al., 1999) .\n\nBmPTP-h-coding sequence (NCBI Gene ID: 692515) was cloned into the pSL1180 expression vector with a Flag tag at the N-terminus using primer set 1 in Table 1 dsRNA to Bmptp-h or red fluorescent protein gene (RFP) (dsBmPTP-h or dsRFP) were in vitro synthesized using T7 RiboMAX Large Scale RNA Production System (Promega, USA) with the primer sets 2 and 4. Plasmids or dsRNA were transfected into BmE cells using X-treme GENE transfection reagent (Roche, Switzerland) following the manufacturer's instruction. dsRNA was injected into silkworm larvae (20 mg/larva) at second day of fifth instar through the second last stoma in abdomen with a fine needle.\n\nFor infection of cells, 5000 virions were incubated with 1\u00c210 6 BmE cells 48 h after transfection. For infection of silkworm larvae, 10 000 virions were injected into silkworm larvae at Day 3 of 5th instar. At different time points after infection as indicated in graph, the expression level of Bmptp-h or BmNPV gp64 was subjected to quantitative PCR analysis.\n\nTotal RNA was extracted from cells or tissue samples using Total RNA Kit (Omega, USA) at different time points post viral infection and qPCR was performed using SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (TaKaRa, Japan) on a StepOne Plus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, USA) with a program consisting of an initial denaturing step of 30 s at 95 C and 40 amplification cycles consisting of 5 s at 95 C followed by 30 s at 60 C. Bmptp-h and sw22934 were amplified with primer sets 3 and 6 accordingly. For analysis of BmNPV replication, total DNA was extracted from viral infected BmE cells using the Universal Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (Takara) as described. BmNPV gp64 and BmGAPDH were amplified with primer sets 5 and 7 respectively. The expression level of Bmptp-h or BmNPV gp64 genes were normalized to the control sw22934 or BmGAPDH. The relative viral abundance was determined as described previously (Jiang et al., 2012) .\n\nCells were solubilized in lysis buffer (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM TriseHCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% NP-40 pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). After centrifugation at 17 000 g for 15 min at 4 C, the supernatant was collected on ice for western blot analysis. Concentration of cell lysate was determined by BCA assay. A total of 20 mg protein per sample was resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE. After transfer to PVDF membrane (GE Health Care, USA), samples were immuno-blotted with anti-FLAG mAb or anti-Tubulin mAb (Sigma, USA) following the standard procedure.\n\n1\u00c210 6 BmE cells transfected with BmPTP-h expression vector were solubilized in 200 ml lysis buffer, then pre-cleared and incubated with casein (0.2 mM) for 10 min at 30 C. The reaction was terminated by addition of TCA buffer. After centrifugation at 17 000 g for 10 min, 200 ml supernatant was mixed with 20 ml molydbate dye and liberated phosphate was visualized at 750 nm using a microplate reader (Promega).\n\nData were presented as the mean \u00b1 S.D. (n \u00bc 3). Statistical significant differences were determined by Student's t-test (for comparison of two means), or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for multiple comparison test (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01). ], a few display variations at the first two amino acid residues and one has Gln instead of Ser/Thr at last position which is predicted to be catalytic inactive. Whereas 79 out of the 107 human PTPs are multidomain proteins, less than a half of silkworm PTPs harbor at least one characteristic domain, which may contribute to the specific interaction with regulatory or targeting molecules.\n\nBmptp-h (NCBI Gene ID: 692515), which was proposed to be the origin of BmNPV ptp, encodes an atypical VH1-like DUSP. It is homologous to Drosophila CG13197 and distantly related to human DUSP11, and the latter binds splicing complex and has been implicated in inflammatory bowel disease (Hasler et al., 2011; Yuan et al., 1998) . BmPTP-h may also have 5'-triphosphatase activity using RNA as a substrate like DUSP11 (Deshpande et al., 1999) . Clear function of these molecules is unknown. \n\nTo evaluate the physiological functions of BmPTP-h, we first analyzed its expression profiles at different developmental stages or in different tissues by qPCR. We found the expression level of Bmptp-h increased gradually at larval stage, and it reached the highest level on the 3rd day of fifth instar (I5D3), which was more than 15-times higher than in 1st instar (I1), then decreased afterwards until the end of pupal stage (Fig. 1A) . Next, we examined Bmptp-h transcriptional levels in different tissues dissected from I5D3 larvae (Fig. 1B) . A relative high level of Bmptp-h was detected in the fat body, followed by testes.\n\nSince previous studies have shown BmNPV PTP is important for viral productive infection in silkworm larvae and cell line, and BmPTP-h shares 48.2% identity (80.7% similarity) with BmNPV PTP on amino acid sequence (Takagi et al., 1998) , we speculated that BmPTP-h also plays a role in regulating interaction between virus and host. For that reason, we injected NPV virions into I5D3 larvae and investigated the expression profile of Bmptp-h during infection. Although the expression level of Bmptp-h changed over time during the progression, viral infection induced higher level of Bmptp-h transcription compared to the uninfected larvae at the same time point (Fig. 2A) . The expression level of Bmptp-h in uninfected I5D7 larvae (96 h) was lower than that at I5D3 (0 h), which is in accordance with the result shown in Fig. 1A . However, in viral-infected larvae Bmptp-h transcript level was much higher at 96 h. We also found expression of Bmptp-h was potently induced by BmNPV infection in BmE cells after 48 h compared with uninfected cells and increased sharply afterwards (Fig. 2B) .\n\nTo test the tyrosine phosphatase activity of BmPTP-h, we expressed a Flag-tagged BmPTP-h in BmE cells (Fig. 3A ), and measured the enzymatic level of cell lysates (Fig. 3B) . Cells expressing Flag-BmPTP-h showed a significant increase in the overall PTP activity level compared to the control, indicating that BmPTP-h is catalytic active and able to regulate the cellular functions via tyrosine dephosphorylation. To investigate whether BmPTP-h is involved in anti-viral response, we performed dsRNAmediated RNAi to deplete the expression of Bmptp-h in BmE cells (Fig. 4A ). About 80% decrease in transcript level was obtained by dsBmPTP-h compared with dsRFP. 48 h after dsRNA transfection, we challenged cells with BmNPV or BmNPV-GFP, and analyzed the viral abundance by qPCR or fluorescence microscopy ( Fig. 4B and C). Replication of viral DNA or the amount of GFP-positive cells was remarkably reduced when Bmptp-h was depleted. We then overexpressed Bmptp-h in BmE cells and measured the susceptibility of these cells to BmNPV or BmNPV-GFP infection (Fig. 5) . Viral replication or GFP-positive cells significantly increased in BmPTPh-overexpressing cells than in control. These results suggest that BmPTP-h promotes viral productive infection in cells.\n\nIn order to investigate whether depletion of Bmptp-h has any effect to viral infection in vivo, we injected dsRNA into silkworm larvae 12 h before BmNPV infection and measured viral abundance. Since RNAi efficiency might not be the same in different tissues, we dissected several tissues and examined the expression level of Bmptp-h in them separately (Fig. 6A) . With the exception of midgut (data not shown), the relative expression levels of Bmptp-h decreased to 25%e40% after injection of dsRNA targeting Bmptp-h (dsBmPTP-h) compared to the control dsRFP in fat body, trachea and head. Furthermore, in those tissues viral abundance was all significantly decreased (Fig. 6B) , and the reduction was most dramatic at 96 h post infection, suggesting that Bmptp-h silencing might have adverse effect to viral replication in vivo.\n\nIn this study, we found BmNPV infection induced the expression of BmPTP-h, a dual-specific phosphatase in silkworm larvae and BmE cells. Partial depletion of Bmptp-h by dsRNA inhibited BmNPV replication, and over-expression of Bmptp-h resulted in enhanced viral replication. The results suggest that BmPTP-h might be one of the host factors that are beneficial to the replication of BmNPV. Although RNA interference is considered to be the major antiviral mechanism in insect, induction of immune signaling pathways, including Toll, IMD and JAK-STAT pathways have been observed upon viral infection (Merkling and van Rij, 2013; Sabin et al., 2010; Zambon et al., 2005) . Since the signal transduction largely relies on protein phosphorylation, as a dual-specific phosphatase, BmPTP might be exploited by virus to disrupt the signaling cascades through targeting the phosphorylated molecules, resulting in immunosuppression. Furthermore, since double mutation of NPV lef-4 and NPV ptp, which are the only two viral genes encoding proteins with RNA triphosphatase activity did not alter viral RNA processing, it was proposed that host mRNA-capping enzymes might be involved in viral RNA maturation (Li and Guarino, 2008) . Considering the RNA triphosphatase activity that BmPTP-h possibly possesses, it could also be hijacked by virus for efficient viral RNA synthesis.\n\nIdentification of host factors important for viral infection, especially for viral replication have been carried out using Drosophila and human cells by genome-wide RNAi screening (Hao et al., 2008; Konig et al., 2010) . Those studies reported that molecules involved in kinase-regulated signaling, ubiquitination and phosphatase activity are enriched in hostepathogen interaction network. However, the mechanism on how virus induces the expression of those \"benefit\" factors in host is unclear. One hypothesis is that production of viral proteins down-regulates the repressors of those factors in host, such as microRNA, resulting in Fig. 6 . Knock-down of Bmptp-h reduced BmNPV replication in vivo. (A) dsRFP or dsBmPTP-h was injected into silkworm larvae at second day of fifth instar and knock-down efficiency of Bmptp-h was measured in different tissues. (B) 24 h after dsRNA treatment, silkworm larvae were injected with BmNPV. Relative abundance of virus post infection determined by BmNPV gp64 expression level was measured in corresponding tissues. The mRNA level of target genes was normalized to the internal control (sw22934 or BmGAPDH) and represented as mean \u00b1 S.D. (n \u00bc 3). Statistical significance was assessed using Student's t-test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. increased expression of molecules favoring viral replication (Fu et al., 2015) . A few studies suggested that baculovirus infection leads to an overall suppression of host cellular microRNA (Mehrabadi et al., 2013; Singh et al., 2012) , whether there is a microRNA targeting Bmptp-h needs further identification.\n\nIt is interesting to note that besides BmNPV ptp, several other baculoviral auxiliary genes are also acquired from host insect genome via horizontal gene transfer (HGT), such as ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase (egt) and fibroblast growth factor (vfgf) (Katsuma et al., 2008) . Although they are dispensable for virus production in cell line, they are reported to be involved in controlling host physiology. No direct evidence is available showing that BmPTP-h is also playing roles in regulating silkworm wandering behavior, however our study demonstrated that it promotes viral replication, facilitating rapid spread throughout the whole body of the silkworm to overwhelm the immune system. In contrast to this \"collaboration\" strategy employed by baculovirus in the case of BmPTP-h, HGT of host genes usually allows pathogen to compete with hosts for the molecules necessary to maintain physiological integrity or dampen host response by acting as dysfunctional mimics (Liu et al., 1997; Zhao et al., 2014) . Kamita et al. showed inserting Bmptp-h into the BmNPV ptp-deleted virus rescued the inability to induce ELA, but to a much lesser extent than WT virus, suggesting that the modification on BmNVP ptp sequence during evolution may have provided selective advantages and drive their fixation in the viral genome to counteract the host defense.\n\nIn conclusion, we did a whole genome survey for silkworm PTP gene sets and characterized their homologous relationship with human and fruit fly PTPs. We also found BmPTP-h acts as a host factor facilitating baculovirus infection via promoting its DNA replication. Further understanding of the pathways, in which BmPTP-h participates will provide new insight into the hostevirus interactions that control the viral replication."}
