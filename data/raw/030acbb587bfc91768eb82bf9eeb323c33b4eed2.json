{"title": "Nonstreptococcal Pharyngitis", "body": "Streptococci from Lancefield groups other than A (especially Groups C and G) have been associated definitively with outbreaks (often food-borne) of pharyngitis. 3-5 However, their roles in causing sporadic cases of pharyngitis remain controversial. Little evidence exists to suggest that either group B or F streptococci are frequent or important causes of pharyngitis. 6, 7 The genetic heterogeneity of Lancefield groups C and G streptococci probably has contributed to the lack of consensus on the role(s) of these bacteria as causes of endemic pharyngitis. Lancefield group C streptococci are distinguished morphologically as being large or small colony formers. 8-1~ Large-colony [3-hemolytic group C streptococci are identified as Streptococcus equi. There are three subspecies (ssp) within S equi: equi, equisimilis, and zooepidemicus. 8-w Neither S equi ssp equi nor S equi ssp zooepidemicus is recovered frequently from human sources. However, the latter subspecies has caused human infections after ingestion of unpasteurized milk or dairy products, and many patients identified in these outbreaks developed glomeru-lonephritisP , 4 In contrast, S equi ssp equisimilis regularly is recovered from humans. There are also small-and large-colony [3-hemolytic group G streptococci. Of interest, S equi ssp equisimilis and human biotypes of large-colony {3-hemolytic group G streptococci are closely related. 6 Among the small-colony group C [3-hemolytic bacteria, S anginosus is also recovered frequently from humans. 6-l~ Most of the initial evaluations of the roles of groups C and G beta-hemolytic streptococci as causes of pharyngitis did not differentiate among the various species and subspecies found in these groups. In a study that did not speciate strains of group C streptococci, Hayden et al reported similar rates of groups C and G streptococci recovered from the throats of children with pharyngitis (mean age 11 years) compared with cultures obtained from healthy age-matched controls? 1 Recovery of these strains occurred more frequently in older children and adolescents, however. In addition, these investigators reported an increased rate of recovery and group C (but not group G) streptococci from college students with pharyngitis compared with similarly aged controls observed for noninfectious problems.12 Patients with pharyngitis caused by group C streptococci experienced an illness similar to that caused by GABHS. They were more likely to have fever, headache, tonsillar exudate, and anterior cervical adenopathy than were symptomatic students whose cultures were negative for [3-hemolytic streptococci.\n\nRecent investigations have tended to take into account the genetic relationships of groups C and G streptococci. Cimolai et al performed a case-control study of children older than 2 years of age with clinical evidence of pharyngitis. 6 Although differences in the rates of recovery of groups C and G streptococci were not appreciated between patients and controls, a trend towards significance was noted when results from the geneticallyrelated S equi spp equisimilis and large-colony strains of Group G were combined. This difference became significant when the comparison was limited to moderate or heavy growth (2+, 3+) of these streptococci. In contrast, they did not find differences between cases and controls in the rates of recovery of Group C S anginosus or other nonGroup A beta-hemolytic streptococci. Accordingly, these investigators suggested that a heavy growth of either of the closely related species of S equi spp equisimilis or beta-hemolytic group G streptococci may be associated with clinical pharyngitis in children, whereas other [3hemolytic streptococci were unlikely to cause clinical disease.\n\nFox et al compared the rates of recovery of S equi spp equisirnilis and S anginosus in college-aged patients with phar)aagitis and healthy controls. 8 Similar rates of recovery of both bacterial subspecies were found from cases and controls, suggest~ ing that both could be found as normal flora in as,~anptomatic individuals. 8 However, in a companion article, this same group of investigators reported that patients who had S equi spp equisimilis recovered from their throats had clinical features more similar to those observed with pharyngitis caused by GABHS than to the symptoms observed in patients from whom S anginosis was isolated, l~ The investigators concluded that disease caused by S equi spp equisimilis probably developed in some older adolescents, whereas S anginosus was unlikely to be a true pathogen.\n\nData regarding the usefulness of treating pharyngitis caused by these organisms are not available. The major indications for treatment of patients would be either to prevent nonsuppurative sequelae or to provide symptomatic relief of pharyngitis. Although M proteins similar to those found in rheumatogenic strains of GABHS have been detected in some group C (including S equi spp equisimilis) and group G streptococci, 9 no cases of rheumatic fever after pharyngitis with either group have been reported. However, investigators have not looked in a systematic fashion for groups C or G streptococci in patients with rheumatic fever. Thus, it is possible that some episodes of rheumatic fever might be caused by these bacteria. Evidence that treatment will provide symptomatic relief needs to be established in prospective controlled trials.\n\nIn summary, S equi spp equisimilis and large-colony 13hemolytic group G streptococci may be causes of pharyngitis. However, current data do not support active efforts to confirm this diagnosis or to offer treatment to patients with this syndrome.\n\nArcanobactenum haemo~ticum (formerly known as Corynebactetium haemo~ticum) is an uncommon cause of pharyngitis in adolescents and young adults) 3\"j6 The clinical syndrome associated with infection caused byA haemolyticum is indistinguishable from that caused by GABHS. Typical symptoms include sore throat, fever, and l)anphadenopathy. A skin rash, often described as scarletinaform, occurs in more than 50% of cases and usually follows onset of pharyngeal s)aaaptoms by 1 to 4 days. 13\n\nThe diagnosis of pharyngitis caused by A haemolyticum is based on recovery of the organism from a throat culture of a symptomatic patient. A haem@ticum is a gram-positive pleomorphic rod whose colonies exhibit a 1 mm zone of hemolysis on human and rabbit blood agar. 13 In contrast to C trachomatis, M pneumoniae was recovered frequently from the throats of both cases and controls (15.8% and 17.6%, respectively) in the McMillan study9 The equal rates of recovery from both cases and controls suggest that M pneumoniae may be an innocent bystander in patients with pharyngitis. However, because the organism persists in the throat of infected individuals for weeks to months after infection, asymptomatic children with positive cultures may have had an episode of pharyngitis caused by Mpneumoniae in the recent past. Because the authors could not eliminate this possibility, they were unwilling to dismiss it as a potential cause of pharyngitis. Additional evidence that Mpneumoniae is a cause of pharyngitis comes from the Huovinin study in which this organism was identified in 9% of symptomatic patients. 22 Unfortunately, no control population was used in this study.\n\nDespite the possibility that M pneumoniae may account for approximately 10% of episodes of pharyngitis in older children and adolescents, recommendations for routine diagnosis and treatment of this pathogen in patients with sore throats have not been made.\n\nA number of other bacteria have been identified as uncommon causes of pharyngitis, These organisms include Neisseria gonorrheae, Co~ynebacterium diphtheriae, Co~ynebacterium ulcerans, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pestis, Treponema paUidum, and Francisella tularensis, as well as anaerobes (Vincent's angina). 5 Consideration of these organisms as causes of pharyngitis should be limited to appropriate epidemiological circumstances.\n\nViral infections account for the vast majority of episodes of pharyngitis. Viral causes of pharyngitis are distinguished most easily from disease caused by GABHS by their frequent presentation with manifestations of upper (eg, the common cold) or lower respiratory tract disease (eg, laryngotracheitis, bronchiolitis, or pneumonia). 5 The most fiequent and important viral causes of pharyngitis include adenoviruses, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex viruses types 1 and 2, enteroviruses, and the common respiratory viruses (rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, parainfluenza virus, and coronavirus). 2~ The topic of viral pharyngitis recently was comprehensively reviewed in this journal. 23 Accordingly, the current review will highlight several of the most frequent viral pathogens associated with pharyngitis, as well as the role of HIV as a cause of acute pharyngitis.\n\nAdenoviruses are the most common viral agents associated with pharyngitis, particularly in children under 5 years of age. 23 In contrast, pharyngitis caused by adenoviruses occurs infrequently in older children and adolescents. Edwards et al recovered adenoviruses from approximately 15% of young children prospectively followed from birth up to 7 years of age who presented with fever and pharyngitis. 24 Similarly, Moffet et al reported adenoviruses in 23% of young children hospitalized with exudative pharyngitis. 25 Unfortunately, the clinical presentation of pharyngitis caused by adenovirus is not specific and often is accompanied by the presence of coryza or otitis media. Bronchiolitis, croup, and pneumonia are observed less frequently. 24 One relatively characteristic result suggestive of adenoviral infection is the association of pharyngitis with conjunctivis, known as pharyngoconjunctival fever. Although most adenoviral diseases occur during the winter and spring, this latter syndrome classically presents during the summer and is likely to spread through swimming. 23\n\nEBV is the major cause of classic infectious mononucleosis. This infection typically occurs in the older child or adolescent who presents with fever, malaise, anorexia, exudative pharyngitis, diffuse lymphadenopathy, or splenomegaly. 23,26 Although many episodes of EBV infection may be asymptomatic or atypical in younger children, a classic presentation also may occur. Sumaya et al found that 64 of 113 children diagnosed with EBVassociated mononucleosis were less than 6 years of age. 26 Approximately 50% of both older and younger patients presented with exudative pharyngitis. The constellation of symptoms associated with EBV disease was similar in children less than 4 years of age compared with older children, except that younger patients were more likely to have hepatosplenomegaly, mucopurulent nasal discharge, and a rash. 26 The diagnosis may be missed in the younger child because the heterophile response is decreased in children under 4 years of age. 27 The diagnosis can be confirmed by a panel of specific EBV serologic tests. 27 Recent studies have failed to show any benefit of treatment of EBVassociated mononucleosis with oral acyclovir alone or in combination with steroids. 28, 29 HIV HIV recently has been recognized to cause pharyngitis as part of the acute retroviral syndrome. Fever and pharyngitis have been identified as the primary sign of HIV infection in a cluster of cases of HIV that were linked by sexual contact. 3~ In addition to the symptom of pharyngitis, patients experiencing the acute retroviral syndrome often develop an illness that mimics infectious mononucleosis. 23 The significance of recognizing this syndrome may be the opportunity to provide antiretroviral therapy before the dissemination of HIV within the body."}
