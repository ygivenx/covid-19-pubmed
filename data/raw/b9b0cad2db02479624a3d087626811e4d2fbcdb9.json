The variance in viral load increased with temperature, whilst 27 the mean viral load did not, such that as temperature increased the most 28 susceptible species become more susceptible, and the least susceptible less so. We 29 found no significant relationship between a species' susceptibility across 30 temperatures and proxies for thermal optima; critical thermal maximum and 31 minimum or basal metabolic rate. These results suggest that whilst the rank order 32 of species susceptibilities can remain the same with changes in temperature, the 33 likelihood of host shifts into a given species may increase or decrease.

The first chamber was left 223 empty as a reference cell, to acquire a baseline reading for all subsequent chambers 224 at the start and end of each set of runs, therefore seven groups of flies were 225 assayed in each run. Air was flushed into each chamber for 2 minutes, before 226 reading the previous chamber. Readings were taken every second for 10 minutes 227 by feeding the exiting air through a LiCor LI-7000 infrared gas analyser (Lincoln, 228 NE, USA). Carbon dioxide production was measured using a Sable Systems UI2 229 analog-digital interface for acquisition, connected to a computer running Sable To check for any potential effect of body size differences between species, wing 243 length was measured as a proxy for body size [54] .

We also ran models that included a non-phylogenetic 288 random species effect ( !\":!! ) to allow us to estimate the proportion of variation 289 explained by the host phylogeny [34,35,61].

The phylogenetic covariance matrix, Vp, describes 297 the inter-specific variances in each trait and the inter-specific covariances between 298 them. The residual covariance matrix, Ve, describes the within-species variance that 299 can be both due to real within-species effects and measurement or experimental 300 errors. The off-diagonal elements of Ve (the covariances) are not estimable because 301 no vial has been subject to multiple temperatures and so were set to zero. We 302 excluded D. pseudoobscura from the full model as data for BMR was not collected, 303 but included it in models that did not include any fixed effects, which gave 304 equivalent results.

We observed significant levels of measurement 323 error in the metabolic rate data; this was partially caused by respiratory chamber 324 order during the assay. We corrected for this in two different ways. First, we fitted 325 a linear model to the data to control for the effect of respiratory chamber number 326 and then used this corrected data in all further models.
