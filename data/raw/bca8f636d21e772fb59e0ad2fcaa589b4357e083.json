Concurrently, four parameters of open-field behavior, i.e. Ambulations, Rearing, Fine Movements and Central Ambulatory behavior (a measure of anxiety reduction behavior), were assayed by infrared photobeam detection. Time course studies showed that the mechanism of action of the triazolobenzodiazepine (TBZD), adinazolam, (Deracyn@) is dramatically different from that of the classical benzodiazepine (BZD), diazepam (Valium@), i.e., adinazolam increased, whereas diazepam decreased, 5-HT release within CA, region of hippocampus in the freely moving and behaving rat. Adinazolam initially increased NE release and then decreased NE release in CA, region of hippocampus in the freely moving and behaving rat whereas diazepam only decreased the electrochemical signal for NE; the decrease in NE produced by adinazolam was greater than the decrease in NE release produced by diazepam. The Behavioral Activity Patterns, derived from same animal controls, simultaneously with detection of in vivo microvoltammetric signals for NE release and 5-HT release, showed that the BZD, diazepam, exhibited more potent sedative properties than did the TBZD adinazolam. Hippocampal 5-HT and NE release effects of the TBZD, adinazolam, concomitant with behavioral effects lends explanation to the dual anxiolyticlantidepressant properties of the TBZDs.\n\nwas made during the broad pharmacological and clinical screening of the TBZD series of compounds (Hester et al., 1971; Hester et al., 1980; Pyke et al., 1983; Hoehn-Saric, 1982) . Indeed, the sister compound to adinazolam, alprazolam, differing from adinazolam only by a terminal aminoethyl group, has been commonly used in the clinical management of mild depressive syndromes with anxiety and insomnia (Sheehan, 1980; Chouinard et al., 1982; Shader et al., 1982; Fawcett et al., 1987) .\n\nClearly, the discovery of the TBZDs represents a strategic step in the therapy of patients who present with anxiety concomitantly with depressive affect. Diazepam, the typical BZD, on the other hand, has no antidepressant activity clinically (Lafaille et al., 1991) . The situation remains though, that the clinical results derived from the TBZDs on depression, have virtually never been explained mechanistically from a preclinical viewpoint. For example, although the NE and 5-HT monoamines are integral to cutient thinking about the neurochemistry of depression (Sulser, 1983; Asnis et al., 1992) , adinazolam has been reported to have only weak inhibitory effects on NE reuptake (Sethy and Harris, 1981) , no specific effect on inhibiting the reuptake of 5-HT (Lahti et al., 1983 ) and no effect on dorsal raphe (DR) 5-HT neuronal firing (Tunnel and de . The present hypothesis was that the previous in situ, in vitro and anesthetized studies used, had inherent limitations in the technologies, which masked the detection of changes in the monoamines produced by adinazolam. Therefore, in vivo microvoltammetry with a miniaturized three-microelectrode potentiostat system was utilized to study the effects of adinazolam on CA, hippocampal NE and S-HT release while infrared photocell beams.\n\nsurrounding the faradaic shielded chamber, performed a computerized digital and analog record of each separate component of open-field behavior. Our hypothesis was that the uniquely high temporal and spatial resolution of both behavioral and neurochemical technologies would aid in revealing the neurochemical and behavioral effects of adinazolam.\n\nValidation for the on-line NE signal came from the following studies which showed that (a) the NE peak increased after the administration of the a, adrenergic antagonist, yohimbine, and decreased after the administration of the a2 adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine (Broderick, 199la; Broderick, 1997) and (b) that the NE peak can be detected electrochemically by an oxidation reaction of this monoamine Sauad-Chagny et al., 1990) . Validation for the 5-HT peak came from the following: (a) studies which showed that the 5-HT peak increased after the administration of the 5-HT precursor, I-tryptophan (Broderick and Jacoby, 1988) , and (b) studies which showed that the 5-HT peak decreased after the administration of the 5-HT,, agonists, buspirone and ipsapirone Broderick and Piercey, 1990) .\n\nMultiple neurotransmitters are detected in one voltammogram or recording in a matter of seconds with in vivo microvoltammetry. In the present paper, NE and S-HT are the focus because of their integral relationship with anxiety and depression. Detection of synaptic concentrations of NE and 5-HT in the CA, area of hippocampus, are release mechanisms, primarily. This conclusion is based not only on data, mentioned above, that adinazolam has only weak effects on NE reuptake and no effects on 5-HT reuptake in vitro, but also on data which showed that gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), a neuronal depolarization blocker (Walters and Roth, 1972) , decreased 5-HT concentrations in the chloral hydrate anesthetized animal (Broderick, 199 1 b; Broderick, 1992) .\n\nThe hippocampal formation is organized into subcortical subdivisions; CA, region of hippocampus, selected as the neuroanatomical site for these studies, is one subdivision within the subcortical region.\n\nThe subcortical hippocampal formation is divided into hippocampus proper, also known as Cornu Ammonis (hence, CA or CA pyramid), the dentate gyrus and the subiculum; CA, , CA, , CA,, and CA, are further subdivisions of Cornu Ammonis. CA, pyramids are lamellar and the moleculure, the radiatum, the pyramidale, the oriens and the alveus comprise a pyramid ( Ramon y Cajal, 1955) .\n\nPyramidal neurons of the CA, region, the regio superior, are medium sized and have intrinsic and extrinsic connections which innervate the subiculum and provide the origin of the hippocampal outflow in the fomix; longer projections innervate the nucleus accumbens of the ventral striatum, brain reward circuits, through the fomix (Amaral and Insausti, 1990) .\n\nNeurochemical studies of the CA, region have demonstrated that this region of hippocampus is densely innervated with 5-HT projections from 5-HT somatodendrites, DR (Jacobs and Azmitia, 1992) .\n\nMoreover, a 5-HT innervation to the locus coeruleus (LC) has been demonstrated as well (Pickel et al. 1977) ; LC is a primary source of noradrenergic innervation to the hippocampus. Hippocampal pyramidal neurons of the CA, region exhibit a pharmacological profile similar to that of the 5-HTlp, 5-HT, and 5-HT, class (Andrade and Chaput, 1991) . Importantly, the miniature sensors (microelectrodes used in these studies, have a sensitive spatial resolution, amenable for detection of NE and 5-HT within the CA, region of Cornu Ammonis. (Broderick, 1997) .\n\nAnxiety and depression are personified within the act of behaving. Anxiety and depression can be expressed in a variety of ways which are behaviorally dependent on the environment and specific behavioral tests and responses to novelty have played a substantial role in animal models of affective\n\nAlthough open-field behaviors have been reliable assays in these animal models (Gray, 1971 ), simply monitoring a parameter like Ambulations in an open-field paradigm becomes a complex measure of both anxiety and exploratory behavior (Gray, 1982 neurons to simultaneously censor and select specific sensory stimuli (Oades, 1985) . Moreover, in the Behavioral Inhibition Theory, hippocampal 5-HT has been considered significant as relevant to the \"shift\" mechanism changing from ongoing behavior to new behavior in a novel environment (Soubrie. 1986 ).\n\nTherefore, the purpose of the present paper was to compare TBZDs (adinazolam) with BZDs (diazepam) in an in vivo paradigm with which we were able to use same animal control to examine electrochemical signals for NE and separate electrochemical signals for 5-HT, each within seconds of release, during time course studies. The purpose was to detect changes in synaptic concentrations of CA, hippocampal NE and 5-HT during the time in which open-field behavioral changes were actually occurring, in order to decipher a possible preclinical mechanism of action for the clinically documented dual antianxiety-antidepressant activity of adinazolam.\n\nThe studies were done with unrestrained, freely moving, male, Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River. Supply Co. Inc., NY). Animals recovered in a bedded Plexiglas chamber (dimensions 12\" x 12\"~ 18\").\n\nAnimals were treated with physiological saline (body weight in cc/kg i.p.) immediately after surgery.\n\n. .\n\nIn Vivo Electra-(Microvm:\n\nThe methods for the manufacture of the three in vivo electrochemical microelectrodes are published by this laboratory (Broderick, 1989) . A review of the historical and technical aspects of the field of in vivo electrochemistry is cited (Broderick, 1990) . The ability to distinguish between DA and NE, by in vivo microvoltammetry has been published (Broderick, 1988) . In viva electrochemical current was measured in picoamperes (pA) as a function of the semidifferentiation of time in seconds. Current was directly proportional to the concentration of each neurotransmitter according to the Cottrell Equation, which equates concentration of molecules oxidized with the amplitude of the oxidation peak which denotes electrochemical current. Logarithmic regression analysis indicated that the lowest detection limits for NE and 5-HT in vitro, approached 6 nmoles and 3 mnoles, respectively in the first preconcentration step (Broderick, 1989; Broderick, 1993; Broderick, 1997) . The current produced by the oxidation of NE within CA, region of hippocampus was detected in lo-15 seconds whereas that produced by 5-HT was detected in lo-12 seconds in each in vivo microvoltammetric scan. NE release and S-HT release, at each data point, represented a measurement in pA of NE and S-HT current within CA, region of hippocampus. Current for NE and 5-HT, was detected within the same synaptic environment.\n\nIn vivo microvoltammetric (semidifferential) studies on freely moving and behaving Sprague Dawley rats were begun approximately 18 to 21 days after the aseptic surgical procedures were performed. On each experimental day, an animal was placed in a faradaic, Plexiglas chamber (dimensions: 24\"~ 18\"~ 23.5\"). The three microelectrode assembly, enclosed within the animal's prosthetic acrylic cap, was connected to a CV37 detector (BAS, West Lafayette, IN) by means of a mercury commutator (Br. Res.\n\nInstr., Princeton, NJ), a flexible cable, and a mating connector (BJM Electronics, Staten Island, NY).\n\nThe CV37 was electrically connected to a Minigard surge-suppressor (Jefferson Electric, Magnetek, NY) , which was then connected to an isolated electrical ground. In vivo electrochemical signals for NE release and for 5-HT release within CA, region of hippocampus in the freely moving and behaving animal were detected every five minutes; each five minute period included a two minute cell deposition time. Stable in vivo electrochemical signals for NE release and 5-HT release were evident before either adinazolam (10 mg/kg i.p., first hour, 2 mg/kg ip., second hour) or diazepam (1 mg/kg i.p., first hour, 3 mg/kg i.p., second hour) was administered. Adinazolam (Pharmacia and Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, MI) or diazepam (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in doubly distilled water; solutions were made fresh on the day of each study.\n\nThe behavioral chamber was novel to each animal, although each animal was habituated before either adinazolam or diazepam was injected, i.p. The behavioral chamber was equipped with side-by-side double doors (dimensions 15.75\" x 23.5\") to enable a facile injection procedure. A series of infrared photobeams was encased in aluminum frames around the chamber's perimeter. When activated with an IBM computerized circuit, the infrared photobeams detected the animal's position in the behavioral chamber on an x-y axes positional basis. Thus, multiple concurrent measures of the animal's activity were simultaneously assayed. The specific activities of each animal assayed were: (1.) Ambulations (running-forward locomotion interacting with the maintenance of a horizontal position of the head without lateral turning (Teitelbaum et al., 1990) ), (2.) Rearing (maxima1 upward vertical movement of the head, without lateral turning (Teitelbaum et al., 1990) ). Ambulatory behavior is called anti-agoraphobic (anti-thigmotactic) behavior; the behavior indicates a reduced fear on the part of the animal (Geyer, 1990) ]. Mesolimbic 5-HT release has been shown to be closely temporally allied with natural open-field movement (Broderick and Phelix, 1997) . The status of the infrared photobeams was sampled every 100 msec. Our system is a modified version of an Activity statistically analyzed, using the same statistical tests, described above. Behavioral results are expressed as frequency of events. Each animal was used as its own control. Statistics revealed the most dramatic differences between adinazolam and diazepam in the directional response occurred with the monoamine, 5-HT. Therefore, 5-HT results are presented first.\n\nand 5-HT. Figure 1 shows the effect of adinazolam (10 mg/kg i.p., first hour, and an additional 2 mg/kg i.p., second hour) on synaptic concentrations of 5-HT within the CA, region of hippocampus of the freely moving and behaving, male, Sprague Dawley rat. Adinazolam significantly increased the in vivo electrochemical signal for 5-HT (Kruskal-Wallis One Way ANOVA on Ranks:\n\np<O.OOOl, H=19.9, d+2 (N=4) (unequal variance)). Post hoc analysis further showed that there were statistically significant differences from baseline in the second hour of study (Dunn's Method: pcO.05, q=4.06 (second hr.)).\n\nSerotonin release was increased to 115% over baseline (baseline=lOO%) within 10 minutes and was maximally increased to 209% above baseline within 90 minutes after adinazolam administration.\n\nFurther post hoc analysis, which delineated one-half hour effects of adinazolam on 5-HT release in hippocampus, showed that each of the four one-half hour effects was statistically increased over Adlnazolam Figure 2 shows the effect of adinazolam (10 mg/kg i.p., first hour, and an Behavioral chamber was novel to each animal; animals were habituated before adinazolam injection.\n\nand Frewcv of Central m Figure 6 shows the concurrent effect of adinazolam (10 mg/kg i.p., first hour, and an additional 2 mg/kg i.p., second hour) on the frequency of Central Ambulations (anti-agoraphobia) in each animal in which 5-HT release and NE release were detected on line, with in vivo microvoltammetry, and in which Ambulations, Rearing, and Fine Movement frequencies were monitored concurrently. Adinazolam increased and subsequently decreased the frequency of Central Ambulations; this biphasic effect was statistically significant (Kruskal-Wallis\n\nOne Way ANOVA on Ranks, pcO.0197, H = 11.7, df=4 (N=4) (unequal variance)). Although an increase in the Central Ambulatory behavior occurred in the first half-hour, the Dunn's Method \"q\" value was 2.0069 (p>O.O5). Adinazolam began to exhibit anti-agoraphobia behavior ten minutes after injection, at which time, the increased response was approximately three-fold higher than the mean baseline for the Central Ambulatory response. Photobeam interruptions, which denote anti-agoraphobic behavior, are increased Ambulations (locomotor activity) into the center of the faradaic, behavioral am and Fremv of AX&&&XL Figure 9 shows the effect of diazepam (lmglkg i.p., first hour, and an additional 3 mg/kg Lp., second hour) on the frequency ( Post hoc analysis showed that there were statistically significant differences from baseline in both hours Ambulations remained below baseline values throughout the two hour period of study.\n\nDiazenam and Frequencv of Rearinas, Figure 10 shows pcO.05, q=2.52 (first hour and q=3.24 (second hour)). No statistically significant difference occurred between the two dose effects (Dunn's Method: p>O.O5, q=l.Ol). Therefore, the effects of diazepam on\n\nRearing behavior were not dose dependent at the doses studied. It is noteworthy that the initial effect,\n\ni.e. the first four time points after diazepam injection were similar to baseline values, but the standard errors were correspondingly high; the unusual response effect of one animal contributed to this effect. m and Frequency of Fine Moveme& Figure 11 shows the effect of diazepam (lmgikg i.p., first hour, and an additional 3 mgikg i.p., second hour) on the frequency (number) of Fine Movements in each animal in which 5-HT release and NE release were detected, on-fine, with in vivo microvoltammetry, and in which ambulatory and rearing activity patterns were monitored concurrently, Each data point represents the mean +/-SE of natural Fine Movement behavior (N=5) followed by mean +/-SE of changes in Fine Movement behavior produced by diazepam (N=5; same animal control). Behavioral chamber was novel to each animal; animals were habituated before diazepam injection.\n\nanalysis revealed that the statistically significant decrease occurred at the 3 mgikg dose of diazepam (Dunn's Method: ~~0.05, q=2.90). There was no statistically significant difference in effects between the first hour dose (1 mg/kg) and the second dose (3 mgikg) (D unn's Method: ~~0.05, q=1.90). The initial Fine Movement response to diazepam, at the 1 mgikg dose. occurred similarly to the Rearing response to diazepam at the 1 mgikg dose of diazepam. It was again, the unusual response of one animal which contributed to this behavioral effect; it was, in fact, the same animal who had provided the unusual Rearing response. q=2.481). Since increased Ambulations in the center of the chamber has been associated with a fear reduction response [anxiety reducing (anxiolytic) effect] of a drug (Geyer, 1990) , it is noteworthy that diazepam produced a marked sedation which masked its anxiolytic properties in this Central Ambulatory paradigm.\n\nAlways pertinacious has been the role for 5-HT in the mechanism of action of drugs classically used to treat depression (Coppen et al., 1963; Walinder et al., 1976; Menkes et al., 1980; Wang and Aghajanian, 1980; van Praag, 1981; Broderick and Lynch, 1982; Chamey et al., 1984; de Montigny et al., 1984; Asberg et al., 1985; Goodwin, 1986; Price et al., 1986; Blier et al., 1987; Broderick et al., 1989; Mann et al., 1989; Piercey, 1990, 1991; Broderick, 199la; Post et al., 1992; Mongeau et al., 1993; Dubovsky, 1994; Preskom et al., 1994; Baldessarini, 1996; Broderick, 1997) . Kline (1974) though, showed that measurable improvement after 5-HT drugs such as the TCAs, could take as long as two to three weeks to provide adequate pharmacotherapy for depression. Importantly, the TBZD, adinazolam, has been shown to produce a marked improvement within two to seven days post initiation of treatment (Pyke et al., 1983) . Therefore, deciphering the mechanism of action for the TBZDs is critical for assessing a tactical manipulation of the synapse, in order to determine strategies for improving antidepressant therapy.\n\nThis paper is the first report of an immediate action of the TBZD, adinazolam on 5-HT after acute (single) injection. The present results show that the mechanism of action of the TBZD, adinazolam is dramatically different from that of the classical BZD, diazepam. Adinazolam increased 5-HT release within the CA, region of hippocampus while the animal is freely moving and behaving. This response was not at all like the response of the classical BZD, diazepam, which decreased 5-HT release within CA, region of hippocampus using the same freely moving paradigm. The present data support previous preclinical data which indicate that (a) the TBZD, adinazolam, acts through the monoamine, 5-HT (Tunnel and de Montigny, 1984) (b) the BZD, diazepam, decreased hippocampal 5-HT release, which was increased by movement in the X-Maze in the freely moving rat (Wright et al., 1992) and (c) the TBZD, alprazolam also increased CA, hippocampal 5-HT release (Broderick, 1997) . Furthermore, our results are consistent with the previous studies of Turmel and de Montigny (1984) in the sense that the TBZD, adinazolam, had different effects on 5-HT-ergic function than did the BZD, diazepam. In the Tunnel and de Montigny studies, diazepam did not induce 5-HT sensitization in neuronal firing within the same 5-HT somatodendrites in which adinazolam did induce 5-HT sensitization in neuronal tiring.\n\nThe present results are also consistent with another previous study which reported that adinazolam inhibited aggressive behavior (Kostowski et al., 1986) . Diminished aggressive behavior through an increase in central 5-HT levels, has been previously reported (Malick, 1978; Broderick and Lynch, 1982) . Moreover, our hypothesis that a more sensitive technique such as in vivo microvoltammetry would better reveal 5-HT effects of adinazolam with better temporal and spatial resolution, is supported.\n\nAn overview of the scientific literature reveals that the TBZDs differ strikingly in pharmacological activity from the BZDs, in that the TBZDs show positive results in some assays used to test antidepressant activity (Hester et al., 1980; Lahti et al., 1983; Sethy et al., 1984) . The present results agree with these positive results, e.g., the report of potentiation of NE-induced enhancement of blood pressure (Sethy and Hodges, 1982) . The present data may lend explanation to previous discrepant preclinical data in the literature, about adinazolam, which directly conflict with the data from the clinical literature. To reiterate, the previous data reported that adinazolam was a weak inhibitor of NE reuptake at the synapse, in vitro, and adinazolam, when chronically administered, neither reduced rat cortex beta adrenergic receptor binding (Sethy and Harris, 1981) , nor sensitized rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons to microiontophoretically applied NE (Tunnel and de . Moreover, it appears that a notable difference occurs between the mechanism of action of the TBZD, adinazolam, versus that of the BZD, diazepam where NE is concerned. Whereas adinazolam initially increased NE release and then decreased NE release in CA, region of hippocampus in the freely moving and behaving rat, diazepam only decreased the in vivo electrochemical signal for NE. Moreover, the adinazolaminduced decrease in NE release was greater than the decrease in NE release produced by diazepam.\n\nUsing the in vivo microvoltammetric biotechnology, with highly sensitive temporal and spatial resolution in the freely moving and behaving rat, a magnitude difference in NE effects between adinazolam and diazepam was revealed.\n\nAdinazolam produced a biphasic response on CA, hippocampal NE release whereas diazepam produced a monophasic response.\n\nThe present results confirm the hypothesis that anesthesia could have been masking the effects of adinazolam on the monoamines, NE and 5-HT, as reported in the previous literature. Anesthetic effects of the TBZDs on 5-HT release are especially intriguing because in a similar series of studies from this laboratory, adinazolam did not produce increased 5-HT release in the CA, region of hippocampus in the chloral hydrate anesthetized animal after acute (single) injection (Broderick, 1991a) . Although adinazolam has been shown to be well tolerated in patients who must undergo surgery under general anesthesia (Othmer and Othmer, 1988) , the direct on-line effects of anesthesia on neurotransmitter function and release, during adinazolam treatment, deserves consideration. The lack of adinazolam's effect to modify dorsal raphe 5-HT neuronal firing after acute injection (Tunnel and de , might be dependent, in part, on anesthesia, since Aghajanian showed in 1978 that administration of 5-HT in nerve terminals, should suppress DR neuronal tiring. Moreover, BZDs did not alter the spontaneous firing rate of the DR, even though both systemic and iontophoretic administration of BZDs were found to potentiate the inhibitory effects produced by GABA on DR (Gallagher, 1978) . Nerve cell firing rates have previously been shown to be affected by anesthesia, particularly in the case of catecholamines (Kelland et al., 1989) . Therefore, anesthestic effects may well alter nerve cell firing rates, apriori, thereby masking the effects of adinazolam on 5-HT.\n\nThis laboratory has studied the potency of chloral hydrate anesthesia to affect endogenous 5-HT release (Broderick, 1991b) , using the neuronal impulse inhibitor and depolarization blocker, gammabutyrolactone, (GBL), Roth, 1972, 1974) . In the presence of chloral hydrate, GBL, which is also an anesthetic, (Winters and Spooner, 1965) , neuronal 5-HT depolarization was blocked, thereby, decreasing S-HT release which is dependent on impulse flow. On the other hand, in the freely moving and behaving rat paradigm, when neuronal impulse flow was blocked by GBL, but chloral hydrate was not present, 5-HT release was not blocked (Broderick, 1992) ; these data suggest that GBL blocks inhibitory 5-HT autoreceptor mechanisms, which results in enhanced S-HT release.\n\nThese results indicate that chloral hydrate may act to maintain inhibitory presynaptic autoreceptors and that 5-HT neuronal impulses subsequently differ when anesthesia is present. Taken together, the data suggests that adinazolam's effects on 5-HT release in the chloral hydrate versus the freely moving rat paradigm, may depend on presynaptic 5-HT autoreceptors. Thus, we agree with Blier et al., (1987) that critical mechanisms for antidepressant action reside in presynaptic 5-HT autoreceptors.\n\n. .\n\nThe Behavioral Activity Patterns gleaned from adinazolam vs. diazepam administration, demonstrate that adinazolam inhibited, at least in part, the normal agoraphobia (anxiety) behavior, which is usually observed after an animal is placed in a novel environment (Geyer, 1990) . In contrast, diazepam's known anti-anxiety effect was masked by its sedative properties. The sedative effect produced by diazepam, even at low doses, is clearly more potent than that observed during adinazolam administration. The Behavioral Activity Patterns, which were derived from the same animals and at the same time as the in vivo electrochemical signals for NE release and 5-HT release were detected on-line, showed that the TBZD, adinazolam, produced a significant reduction in three of the four open-field behavioral parameters, at least in certain specific time periods. Adinazolam did not significantly decrease the frequency on Rearing Behavior, for example. However, the adinazolam treated animals exhibited significant spurts of increased open-field behavioral activity distinct from the uninterrupted sedative behavior which was produced by diazepam.\n\nThat adinazolam produced some sedative properties in the clinical situation has been reported (O'Connor et al., 1985; Amsterdam et al., 1986; Feighner, 1986; Cohn et al., 1988) . However, sedative\n\nproperties produced by adinazolam have been delineated by clinical studies as \"limited\" (Kramer and Schoen, 1986) and as \"rare\" (Pyke et al., 1983) . Our data are also consistent with preclinical studies which have shown that the TBZDs have less sedative properties than the classical BZDs (File and Pellow, 1985) . It is widely known that the BZDs exhibit sedation, but, since adinazolam has little or no anticholinergic affects (Feighner, 1986) , it is not surprising that adinazolam produced a lesser sedative effect than did diazepam in the freely moving and behaving rat animal model.\n\n)BZD s_, Not to be ignored in the quest to reveal the mechanism of action of the TBZDs is a discussion of the comparison between a TBZD, such as adinazolam, and a high affinity GABA-A-TBZD, such as lorazepam or clonazepam. Controlled clinical studies have been performed with the expressed purpose of comparing the antidepressant effects of TBZDs with those of high affinity GABA-A-BZDs and the results have shown that similar antidepressant efficacy is produced by e.g. alprazolam vis-a vis lorazepam or alprazolam vis-a-vis clonazepam (Burrows et al., 1993 , Pollack et al., 1993 , Laakman et al., 1995 , Romach et al., 1995 , Davidson, 1997 . Although adinazolam per se, has not been included in these controlled studies, it is likely that one could extrapolate a similar result for adinazolam as well.\n\nBut, that TBZDs have similar efficacy to lorazepam and clonazepam in clinical depression, begs the question: do both TBZDs and high affinity GABA-A-BZDs act through the exact same mechanism on 5-HT? The literature, for the most part, argues against this hypothesis (Gardner, 1986; Jefferson, 1996) , e.g. one study showed that both lorazepam and diazepam were unable to reverse the helplessness syndrome, whereas the 5-HT reuptake inhibitor, fluvoxamine, produced a significant reversal of the helplessness syndrome (Martin et al., 1996) . Thus, further evidence is presented here that it is presumably either a direct effect of adinazolam to increase hippocampal 5-HT release, or some combined interactive NE/S-HT effects of adinazolam that may account for its unique clinical anxiolytic/antidepressant activity.\n\nNevertheless, there are considerations of other possible interactions of the triazolos for producing gradations of antidepressant, as well as anxiolytic activity. Some of these mechanisms could be e.g., (a) hetero-oligomeric GABA-A subunit control of GABA gated CL-channels (Mihic et al., 1994, Costa and Guidotti, 1996) , wherein potentiation of GABA-A responses could occur, (b) platelet activating factor (PAF) antagonism wherein blockade of calcium mobilization could reduce superoxide anion production in macrophages (Gardner et al., 1993; Travers et al., 1995) and/or (c) cytochrome P450-3A4 mechanisms, which could increase triazolo levels for enhanced activity (Nemeroff et al.,1996) . These remain as exciting adjunct and/or alternative mechanisms for exploration into the mechanism of action of the TBZDs.\n\n.\n\nA final note points to the interaction of 5-HT and NE as the mechanism of action for the dual antidepressant/anxiolytic effects of adinazolam. The recent development of the compound venlafaxine, a mixed 5-HT/NE transport antagonist speaks to the principle of mixing aminergic interactions, perhaps even potentiation in the treatment of anxiety and depression (Leonard, 1994) . Drugs of the TBZD type and the \"pyradolo\" type, including alprazolam, adinazolam, and zometapine, truly represent a \"borderland\" therapeutic approach to mixed anxiety and depression (Baldessarini, 1996) .\n\nThe data support our hypothesis that the separation of the in vivo hippocampal 5-HT release effects of the TBZDs provide a strong empirical explanation for the mechanism of action of the dual antidepressant and anti-anxiety action produced by the TBZDs. Specifically, in the case of the TBZD, adinazolam, the data indicates that the modus operandi which separates adinazolam's action from that of the BZD, diazepam, is adinazolam's increased 5-HT-ergic effects on release. Moreover, in the case of the TBZD, adinazolam, the hypothesis of a mixed aminergic action, i.e. an interactive 5-HT and NE synaptic mechanism for its dual antidepressanttanxiolytic effects, is likely."}
