{"title": "SHORT COMMUNICATION Virus RNA Persists within the Retina in Coronavirus-Induced Retinopathy", "body": "Retinal degenerative disorders consist of a diverse degeneration in the absence of vasculitis or inflammation. This degenerative process was associated with a group of diseases frequently associated with a genetic predisposition; however, many cases are of unknown reduction of the photoreceptor layer, loss of interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein, abnormalities in the reticause. Viruses may trigger some of these pathologic pronal pigment epithelium (RPE), and retinal detachments. cesses. In fact, viral infections often precede acute\n\nThe development of the degenerative phase of the dismultifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy and acute macease was controlled by a genetic predisposition of the ular neuroretinopathy, and therefore are under suspicion host and was associated with the development of antias causative agents (1-2). In addition, herpes simplex retinal and anti-RPE cell autoantibodies (11). virus and varicella zoster virus have been implicated in One of the intriguing aspects of this disease process acute retinal necrosis (3, 4) and cytomegalovirus freis the nature of viral clearance. The acute phase of the quently induces a retinitis in immunosuppressed individdisease was associated with the presence of viral prouals (5). Retinal degenerative changes were also seen teins and the detection of infectious virus within the retin Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease and in subacute sclerosing ina (8, 9) . However, after Day 8, infectious virus and viral panencephalitis (6, 7). In order to evaluate the varied proteins were not detected. At this time, anti-virus neuways by which viruses may trigger retinal degenerative tralizing antibody were readily detected within the sera processes, we have developed a model of virus-induced of infected animals. In the absence of infectious virus, retinopathy.\n\nretinal degenerative changes became apparent at Day The murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), 10 and continued for months. The purpose of this study induces an acute and chronic ocular disease in BALB/c was to determine if the virus persisted within the retina mice (8) (9) (10) . In the early, acute phase, 1 to 7 days after and other tissues during the course of this disease proinoculation, a mild retinal vasculitis was observed. The cess. In situ hybridization was selected as a way to demsecond stage was seen by Day 10 and progresses for onstrate virus persistence and to identify the cellular loseveral months. This stage was characterized by a retinal cation of the virus. The JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-JHM) was obtained from American Type Culture Collection in mouse L2 cells. Viral infectivity titrations were performed on L2 cells propagated in 96-well microtiter plates. The infectivity of stock virus was 10 5.6 TCID 50 /0.1 ml. Clone 2-2, which contained cDNA representing MHV-A59 genes 4-6 cloned into PstI site of pGEM-1 (Promega, Madison, WI), was provided by Dr. Susan R. Weiss (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) (12) . The insert was excised from the vector and purified by gel electrophoresis. cDNA labeling with digoxigenin-11-dUTP was carried out by the random primed method using a commercially available kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN).\n\nIntravitreal inoculation of 12-week-old male BALB/c mice was performed as previously described (8, 9) . Mice ization, the slides were deparafinized, rehydrated, digested with proteinase K, and air-dried. Twenty-five microliters of prehybridization solution (50% deionized peroxidase procedure, as described previously (8, 9) . Rabbit polyclonal antibody to MHV (F88, provided by Dr. formamide, 11 Denhardt's solution, 41 SSC (11 SSC is 150 mM NaCl plus 15 mM sodium citrate), 10% dextran Katherine Holmes, Uniformed Services Univ Health Sci, Bethesda, MD) or normal rabbit sera were used. sulfate, and 100 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA) was added to each slide, followed by incubation for 1 hr In order to evaluate the detection of viral RNA by in situ hybridization, we first studied JHM virus replication at room temperature. Five microliters of the labeled probe was added to the slides (final concentration of labeled in L2 cells. The virus cDNA probe hybridized to virus RNA in the infected cultures. In contrast, no reactivity cDNA was 100 ng/ml). Coverslips were placed on slides and the probe DNA was denatured on a hot plate at 90\u040a was noted in the untreated L2 cells. Moreover, RNase treatment of infected cultures inhibited reactivity and in-for 10 min. The slides were cooled on ice and hybridization was carried out for 16 hr at 37\u040a in a humidified box.\n\ncubation of the infected cultures with plasmid cDNA resulted in no reactivity (data not shown). Analysis of in situ After removal of coverslips the slides were washed in 21 SSC twice for 10 min at room temperature, 11 SSC hybridization for viral RNA in JHM virus infected BALB/c mouse eyes is shown in Fig. 1 . When uninfected BALB/ for 30 min at room temperature with mild agitation, and 0.11 SSC twice for 10 min at 42\u040a. Negative controls, c mouse eye sections were incubated with the viral cDNA probe, no reactivity was observed (Fig. 1A) . In contrast, RNase A (Boehringer Mannheim) treated tissue sections, digoxigenin-labeled linearized pBR328 (Boehringer when JHM virus-infected BALB/c mouse eye sections were incubated with the viral cDNA probe, a positive Mannheim) as nonhomologous probe, and in situ hybridization without probe were processed similarly.\n\nsignal was noted within the retina (Fig. 1B ). If the virusinfected eye sections were pretreated with RNAase, the The slides were washed twice for 5 min in buffer 1 (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl), then they were reactivity with the viral probe was inhibited. Likewise, when JHM virus-infected BALB/c mouse eyes were incu-immersed in buffer 2 (0.5% blocking reagent solution, Boehringer Mannheim) for 60 min. After brief dipping bated with plasmid cDNA, no reactivity was noted. This assay system was then used to evaluate mouse in buffer 2, they were incubated with anti-digoxigenin antibody (1 in 500 dilution with buffer 2) conjugated to eyes harvested from 1 to 60 days after JHM virus inoculation. By in situ hybridization, the viral RNA was detected alkaline phosphatase for 1 hr. This was followed by two 15-min washes in buffer 1 and immersion in buffer 3 (100 within the retina from Day 1 to Day 60. The mean number of positive signals of reactivity with the viral cDNA probe mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl) for 3 min. Visualization was performed with nitroblue tetrazo-are summarized in Fig. 2 . Multiple areas of viral RNA were detected within the eye throughout the 60-day pe-lium salt and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate solution in a dark sealed box for up to 16 hr and the reaction riod, while the maximal number of positive signals were noted between Day 5 and Day 10. We next evaluated the was stopped by immersion in buffer 4 (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA) before mounting in Aqua-Mount cellular distribution of viral RNA within the eye. As is seen in Table 1 , the majority of viral RNA was detected (Lerner Laboratories, Pittsburgh, PA). Paraffin sections were also assayed for viral proteins by an immuno-in the retina. Low levels of viral RNA were detected in The data presented indicates that the viral RNA reviral cDNA probe ( Table 2 ). The retina was classified into mains within the retina throughout the 60-day period of four areas: ganglion cell layer, inner retina, outer retina, analysis. Since our earlier studies showed that infectious and RPE. The inner retina contains the inner plexiform virus and viral antigen was not detected within the retina layer, the inner nuclear layer, and Muller cells. The outer after Day 7, we wanted to compare the two assay sysretina consists of the outer plexiform layer, outer nuclear tems on the same samples (8, 9) . Both viral RNA and layer, photoreceptor inner and outer segments, and viral protein were detected in 100% of the eyes removed Muller cells.

However, viral antigen was detected in only one of four eyes removed 8 to 10 days postinoculation and was seen in the retina, viral protein could be detected within the liver at Day 1 through Day 8 postinoculation.

Thus the persistent infection was associated with the ever, after Day 8, viral protein was not detected by immunocytochemical staining even though viral RNA was de-CNS and not the liver in this model system (26) .

Moreover, evaluation of the liver revealed a similar virus and viral proteins were detected. The loss of infectious virus and viral proteins was correlated with the pattern of viral persistence, indicating that the virusinduced retinopathy was associated with a systemic activation of several components of the immune system.
