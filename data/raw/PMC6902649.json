{"title": "Influenza virus detection: driving change in public health\nlaboratories in the Western Pacific Region", "body": "As we observe the 100th anniversary of the 1918 influenza pandemic, we are reminded of\nthe importance of preparedness for and adequate response to influenza, and the critical\nrole of influenza surveillance through laboratory detection. Influenza virus detection\nhas helped drive the development of diagnostic and virology laboratories in the World\nHealth Organization (WHO) Western Pacific Region over the last 10\u201315 years, at\nthe same time strengthening their capacity to detect and respond to infectious threats\nbeyond influenza. Such cross-cutting approaches are advocated under the Asia Pacific\nStrategy for Emerging Diseases and Public Health Emergencies (APSED III), (1) which continues to guide Member\nStates in advancing implementation of the International Health Regulations, 2005 (2) and has a dedicated focus on\nstrengthening laboratory capacities.\n\nFor over 65 years, worldwide surveillance of influenza has been conducted through the WHO\nGlobal Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) laboratory network. (3) National Influenza Centres\n(NICs, usually national or provincial diagnostic or reference laboratories) report\nin-country influenza activity to WHO and refer a subset of clinical specimens or virus\nisolates to WHO collaborating centres (WHO CCs) for detailed antigenic and genetic\ncharacterization, antiviral drug susceptibility testing and other analyses. WHO CCs, H5\nReference Laboratories, Essential Regulatory Laboratories and other experts meet\ntwice-yearly to review laboratory and epidemiological data to assist WHO in making\nrecommendations on suitable virus strains for seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines.\n(3)\n\nIn 2017, GISRS laboratories in the Western Pacific Region tested nearly 800 000\nspecimens for influenza (Fig. 1). GISRS monitoring of circulating\ninfluenza viruses in humans enables timely detection and reporting of significant\nchanges in seasonal influenza viruses such as the emergence of the influenza A(H1N1)\npandemic virus in 2009 and the rapid global spread of oseltamivir-resistant seasonal\nH1N1 viruses in 2007\u20132008. (4) It also increases the speed with which novel influenza A\nsubtypes with pandemic potential can be detected, like avian influenza A(H7N9). Through\nthe Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework, vaccine, antiviral and diagnostics\nmanufacturers benefitting from the sharing of viruses and data collected through GISRS\nreturn a monetary contribution to WHO to help strengthen surveillance in the laboratory\nnetwork, particularly in countries with lower capacity. (3) The system does have limitations, however, that\nreflect country capacities and priorities. For instance, the resources needed to\nmaintain NICs and surveillance are primarily concentrated in larger Western Pacific\nRegion Member States rather than small Pacific islands, and countries with unusual\nnumbers of cases are more likely to prioritize sharing. Nevertheless, sharing is key to\nthe success of GISRS, and attention, support and advocacy should be invested into\nenhancing country participation.\n\nFast, accurate and reliable methods for the diagnosis of influenza virus infection are\nneeded for surveillance of emerging viruses, outbreak management, early antiviral\ntreatment, prophylaxis and infection control. The traditional method of influenza virus\ndetection by isolation in eggs or cell culture followed by antigenic typing is\nlabour-intensive and time-consuming, particularly in the context of an outbreak.\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques developed in the past 25 years enabled the\nrapid and specific detection of viral nucleic acid sequences, becoming the gold standard\nfor diagnosis and surveillance. Since 2004, PCR has been instrumental in the early\ndetection of various zoonotic influenza viruses in humans, including A(H5N1), A(H5N6),\nA(H7N9), A(H9N2) and others in the Western Pacific Region. (5) NICs worldwide now routinely perform\nconventional, real-time and/or multiplex PCR for molecular detection of influenza\nviruses. In addition to PCR, some NICs in the Western Pacific Region have introduced\nother molecular tests (e.g. sequencing, pyrosequencing, next-generation sequencing) as\nwell as serological assays (e.g. haemagglutination inhibition, virus neutralization) and\ntesting for sensitivity to antiviral drugs. Nevertheless, serological and\ndrug-sensitivity assays require influenza viruses to be amplified from clinical\nmaterial, meaning that laboratories performing these tests must still maintain good\ncapacity for traditional methods.\n\nNICs are mandated to maintain high technical capacity for influenza testing (3) and are evaluated on the quality\nof their testing through external quality assessment (EQA). Following several outbreaks\nof human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1), WHO initiated an EQA programme in 2007\nto monitor the quality of PCR detection of influenza virus, and to identify gaps in\ntesting and potential areas of support to NICs. The programme has since grown in\nsophistication and now includes seasonal influenza A, influenza B and other non-seasonal\ninfluenza A viruses responsible for human infections, as well as drug susceptibility\nanalysis. In the Western Pacific Region, the percentage of NICs scoring fully correct\nresults for the detection of influenza virus by PCR increased from 57.1% in 2007 (Frank\nKonings, WHO, personal communication, 2018) to 84.2% in the 2017 round of the EQA\nprogramme. (6) In a related\nfirst-run EQA to evaluate performance in the isolation and identification of influenza\nviruses in cell culture, over two-thirds of regional NICs had 80% or more correct\nresults. (7)\n\nAs the majority of NICs in the Region actually test a broad range of infectious diseases\nor are housed in institutions that do, the benefits of technical and human resource\nstrengthening through GISRS have been crosscutting. Annual NIC meetings bring together\nexperts to discuss progress, obstacles and best practices, helping to strengthen\ncountries\u2019 laboratory technical capacity through better coordination, a key\nstrategic action in APSED III. Molecular testing available in the GISRS laboratory\nnetwork has also formed the basis of regional preparedness for detection of emerging\npathogens, including Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (8) and Zika virus. (9) Similarly, drawing on the established EQA programme\nfor PCR detection of influenza virus, WHO worked with WHO CCs to develop and distribute\nan EQA for arboviruses to the network, starting with dengue virus in 2013 and now\nincluding chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever viruses. (10) Not solely an evaluation of performance, EQA helps\nto reveal problems in general laboratory practices, improves the reliability of\ndelivering accurate test results in a timely manner and is usually required for\nlaboratory accreditation. (11)\nFinally, there has long been strong focus on NIC staff development through training in\ndata management and analysis, virus isolation, sequencing and bioinformatics, drug\nsusceptibility testing, infection prevention and control and shipping of infectious\nsubstances. These skills are clearly applicable beyond influenza work, multiplying the\nbenefits of the initial investment manyfold.\n\nSince the 1918 pandemic and the later introduction of GISRS, regional NICs have been\nmaintaining traditional methods, incorporating new technologies and building human\nresource capacity to help strengthen preparedness and response to influenza. The\ncross-cutting advantages generated and the benefits of sharing and collaboration through\nGISRS contribute to better preparedness for future outbreaks of influenza and other\ninfectious diseases."}
