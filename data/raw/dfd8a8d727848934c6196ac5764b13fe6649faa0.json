{"title": "Synthesis and structure-activity relationship studies of water-soluble b-cyclodextrin-glycyrrhetinic acid conjugates as potential anti-influenza virus agents", "body": "Licorice, the roots of the perennial herb Glycyrrhiza glabra which are endemic to Mediterranean and certain areas of Asia, has been one of the oldest and most extensively used medicinal plants [1] . Pharmacologically active components that have been most studied include triterpenoids (3e5%), with glycyrrhizic acid (also known as glycyrrhizin, 1) being present in the highest concentration, and flavonoids (1e1.5%) [2] . Glycyrrhizic acid (1), composed of one molecule of glycyrrhetinic acid (GA, 2) and two molecules of glucuronic acid (Fig. 1 ), can be hydrolyzed by b-glucuronidases in the intestinal bacteria [3] . The amount of 2 in licorice root is reported to be within the range of 0.1e1.6%, depending on species and growing region [4] . Compounds 1 and 2 have attracted considerable attention from chemists and pharmacologists because of their pharmacological and biological effects, such as anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antiviral and other activities [1, 5] .\n\nA lot of studies have confirmed the antiviral activity of glycyrrhizic acid (1) . In Japan, compound 1 has been used in the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis for more than 40 years as the intravenous drug Stronger Neo-Minophagen C (SNMC). It has shown that the administration of SNMC to patients with hepatitis C virus infection lowers the serum transaminase activity, even in the patients resistant to the interferon therapy [6] . Pompei et al. have reported that compound 1 can inhibit many DNA and RNA viruses, including HBV, HIV and EBV in vitro [7] . The antiviral activities of compound 1 against SARS-associated corona virus and influenza virus have also been demonstrated [8, 9] . Recently, it has been noted that the application of compound 1 as a potential antiviral agent can be further improved by using certain drug delivery systems, e.g., mucoadhesive nanoparticles based on poly (methyl vinyl ether-comaleic anhydride) (PVM/MA) [10] .\n\nCompared with glycyrrhizic acid (1) , studies of the antiviral activity of its aglycone 2 are limited, but have attracted increasing attention in recent years. Lin et al. have claimed that compound 2 is 7.5-fold more active against EBV (EC 50 \u00bc 4 mM) than its parent compound 1 (EC 50 \u00bc 30 mM) [11] . Compound 2 shows significant antiviral activity against rotavirus replication at a step or steps subsequent to virus entry [12] . The semi-synthetic derivatives of 2, such as 4-iodobenzyl ester (3), 4-nitrobenzyl ester (4) and 4-(trifluoromethyl) benzyl ester (5) , show potent inhibitory effects on HBV DNA replication activity with IC 50 s at the micromolar level [13] . A recent study has indicated that GA derivative (6) , with a 2-hydroxypropyl group at C-30 and an acetyl group at C-3, show remarkable antiviral activity against TK \u00fe and TK \u00c0 strains of HSV-1 with EC 50 of 4.95 mM [14] . Despite the recognized pharmacological roles as antiviral agents, the main disadvantage of compound 2 and its derivative for application in the food or pharmaceutical industry is their low aqueous solubility due to its non-polar structure (logP: 6.75 [15] ). It has reported that the solubility of compound 2 in water is only 10.6 mg/mL (37 C) , and the water/n-BuOH partition coefficient is 1.02 \u00c2 10 \u00c02 (37 C) [16] . This combination of strong lipophilicity, low solubility and partition coefficient indicates its low bioavailability.\n\nSome strategies have been assessed to overcome the limitation. Cyclodextrins (CDs) are a class of highly water-soluble and biocompatible cyclic oligosaccharides, which can reversely form host-guest inclusion complexes with a variety of guest molecules (drugs), thus improving certain properties of drugs, such as solubility, stability and bioavailability [17, 18] . The CD-triterpene inclusion complexes have been also synthesized to increase the aqueous solubility of certain pentacyclic triterpenes [19e21] . Ishida et al. have reported that the complex of compound 2 and HP-g-CD can improve the oral bioavailability and reduce mRNA expressions of TNF-a, IL-1b and IL-6 [22] . However, such a noncovalent complex is disadvantageous when drug targeting is to be attempted because the complex dissociates before it reaches the organs or tissues to which it is to be delivered [23] . Therefore, direct covalent linkage with b-CD has been suggested, which has been widely used in other water insoluble bioactive molecules, such as fullerene (C 60 ), 5-FU, folic acid and artesunate [24e27]. In our recent studies, a series of water-soluble triazole-bridged b-CD-pentacyclic triterpene conjugates have been synthesized via click chemistry [28, 29] .\n\nAs part of our continued interest in the structurally modified pentacyclic triterpene derivatives as antiviral inhibitors [29e33], we thought it value to prepare a wide range of pentacyclic triterpene derivatives to better explore their antiviral structureactivity relationship (SAR). Herein, we reported the synthesis and anti-influenza A/WSN/33 virus activity of a series of 1:1 b-CD-GA conjugates, in which GA (2) was covalently coupled to the primary face of b-CD via C-3 hydroxyl or C-30 carboxylic acid.\n\nScheme 1 illustrates the synthesis of b-CD-GA conjugates 23e27.\n\nThe commercially available GA (2) was reacted with 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU) in THF to give the stable intermediate 7 in good yield, which proceeded towards a coupling reaction with different terminal alkynylfunctionalized primary amines under basic condition to install a flexible oligo (ethylene glycol) linker (8e12) in 46e82% yield. Then, 8e12 underwent a \"click chemistry\" reaction with 6 A -azide-6 Adeoxy-per-O-acetylated b-CD (16) , which was prepared from the known b-CD (13) in three steps using the conventional method as previously described [34] , in THF/H 2 O in the presence of a catalytic amount of copper sulfate and sodium ascorbate as reducing agent to yield 18e22 with yields ranging from 45% to 61%. At last, the acetyl groups of conjugates 18e22 were removed under Zembl en conditions [35] to afford 23e27 in 80e98% yields.\n\nTo increase the rigidness of the linker, the benzene and piperazine ring were introduced, and Scheme 2 describes the synthesis route for conjugates 30e31 and 33e34. The intermediate 7 was reacted either with an excess of 1-(2-aminoethyl) piperazine, followed by N-alkylation with propargyl bromide or with an excess of 4-ethynylaniline to give alkynyl-functionalized amides 29 and 32 in moderate yields. Similarly, coupling of compounds 29 and 32 with azide-functionalized per-O-acetylated b-CD (16) was performed via click reaction, followed by de-O-acetylation under Zempl en conditions to give the corresponding conjugates 31 and 34 as the final products.\n\nUnlike the b-CD-GA conjugates described above, two other conjugates (35 and 40) , in which the per-O-methylated-b-CD was linked to the carboxylic acid at C-30 of GA or b-CD was linked to the hydroxyl at C-3 of GA, were designed. The method used to prepare conjugate 35 was outlined in Scheme 3, and intermediate 8 was coupled with 6 A -azide-6 A -deoxy-per-O-methylated-b-CD (17) via click chemistry to furnish conjugate 35. Conjugate 40 was synthesized according to the procedure described in Scheme 4. In order to synthesize C-3 alkynyl-functionalized compound 37 required for click reaction, the carboxylic acid group at C-30 of GA (2) was first protected by treatment with benzyl bromide in DMF, followed by O-alkylation at C-3 with propargyl bromide in the presence of sodium hydride. Coupling of compound 16 with O-propargyl GA derivative 37 was carried out via click reaction, followed by de-Obenzylation and de-O-acetylation reactions to give the conjugate 40 in 41% yield over three steps. \n\nThe logarithm of the n-octanol/water partition coefficient (logP) is a well-known measure of molecular lipophilicity [36] . It is used to provide invaluable information for the overall understanding of the uptake, distribution, biotransformation and elimination of a wide variety of chemicals. In our study, the calculated AlogP values were determined using Pipeline Pilot software, Vers. 7.5 (Accelrys Corporation, San Diego, USA) [37] . Due to the introduction of b-CD along with different linkers, all the conjugates showed increased hydrophilicity compared with their parent compound GA (2) ( Table 1) \n\nThe in vitro cytotoxic activity was evaluated for all of the synthesized conjugates 18e27, 30e31, 33e35 and 38e40 using Cell-Titer-Glo \u00ae Assay. The results showed that most conjugates had no cytotoxicity against uninfected Madin-Daby canine kidney (MDCK) cells at a concentration of 50 mM, except for compound 35 possessing cytotoxicity at the same concentration (Fig. 2 ). This finding, together with our previous observation that per-O-methylated-b-CD derivatives of other pentacyclic triterpenes show different cytotoxicity at a concentration of 5e50 mM [28] , indicated that per-O-methylated-b-CD might impart certain degree of cytotoxicity in vitro. The five conjugates (23e27) with the GA and b-CD groups held constant, but with varying of the oligoethylene glycol linker revealed that compound 25 had the highest antiviral activity to A/ WSN/33 (H1N1) virus, indicating 1,2,3-triazole moiety along with diethylene glycol linker could allow a better fit between GA and the proper target. Elongation or shortening of the diethylene glycol chain leads to some decrease of the antiviral activity. Similar results were also observed for conjugates 18e22, in which the b-CD was acetylated, and compound 20 showed the greatest antiviral activity. The diethylene glycol linker of compounds 20 and 25 was further modified by replacing one ethylene glycol moiety with piperazine ring to increase the rigidness of the linker, leading to greatly reduced activity (20 vs. 30, 25 vs. 31). However, the introduction of an aromatic linker (1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)phenyl between b-CD and GA still retained reasonable antiviral activity (23 vs. 34). To our surprise, the introduction of aromatic amino acids methyl esters at C-30 of glycyrrhizin also showed more potent anti-influenza activity and 38e40 against MDCK cells using CellTiter-Glo \u00ae Assay. than their parent compound [9] , indicating an aromatic group at C-30 might be helpful for the binding of GA with its receptor. Evaluation of the three derivatives (18, 23 and 35) with the same linker of (1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl at the C-30 of GA revealed that the sub- (1) (EC 50 \u00bc 364.6 mM) [9] , the effect of b-CD on the antiviral activity of GA is obviously more potent than that of two molecules of glucuronic acid.\n\nIn summary, a series of GA derivatives, altered at position C \n\nTo a solution of alkyne (0.10 mmol) and azide (0.10 mmol) in 1:1 THF-H 2 O (5 mL), CuSO 4 (15.7 mg, 0.10 mmol) and sodium L-ascorbate (40.9 mg, 0.20 mmol) were added.
