{"title": "Knowledge, attitudes, and practices of emergency department staff towards disaster and emergency preparedness at tertiary health care hospital in central Saudi Arabia", "body": "Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21.0 statistical software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Categorical and quantitative variables were summerized using descriptive analysis. Comparing the mean of knowledge scores in relation to 2 categories of study variables was computed using Student\u2019s t-test for independent samples. Comparing the distribution of categorical variables was computed using Chi-square test. A p-value<0.05 was considered significant.\n\nThe questionnaire was distributed to 250 ED\u2019s healthcare providers, and 189 (75.6%) of them responded. The demographic characteristics of the study participants are shown in Table 1. Nearly, two-thirds of the participants were below the age of 30 years. More than 85% of respondents were female. One hundred eleven (58.7%) participants had a clinical experience of more than 5 years, while 78 (41.3%) participants were found to have more than 3 years of clinical service at the tertiary care hospital.\n\nThe correct responses of knowledge towards disaster and emergency preparedness were considered as a total score, where the mean\u00b1standard deviation (SD) score was 6.2\u00b12.5 (Table 1). Comparing the mean knowledge scale score of disaster and emergency preparedness with the demographic characteristics of the participants, it was found that participants with >5 years of total clinical experience had statistically significant (p=0.009) knowledge score 6.2\u00b12.3 which was even higher as compared to participants with \u22645 years 5.5\u00b12.5. Moreover, participants with >3 years of clinical service at the tertiary care hospital had significantly higher knowledge score compared to participants with \u22643 years 7.1\u00b11.5 versus 5.7\u00b12.4; p=0.015).\n\nTable 2 demonstrates participants agreement regarding disaster and emergency preparedness. Around 12 (6.3%) participants were not interested in being aware of the emergency (disaster) operational plans, and approximately 21 (11%) agreed that disaster management and planning is for a few people in the hospital. Furthermore, 66 (34.9%) participants believed that disasters are unlikely to happen in their hospital. The complete consensus was obtained among the participants on the necessity to have an emergency (disaster) operational plan as well as to conduct drills in the hospital, while 186 (98.4%) patients believed that training is necessary for all healthcare workers.\n\nAbout 153 (81%) of the total participants reported the conduct of disaster drill at their hospital and nearly two-thirds indicated the periodic update of the Emergency operational (disaster) plan (EOP). Additionally, slightly over two-thirds of the participants reported about the ongoing training on disaster and emergency preparedness (Table 3).\n\nThe mean familiarity score by the dimension of EPIQ is presented in Table 4. The Mean\u00b1SD score for the overall familiarity of the study participants with EPIQ scale was 3.2\u00b11.3; which fell within the \u2018somewhat familiar\u2019 category to the dimension as identified by the EPIQ scale. The 3 highest Mean\u00b1SD familiarity scores for EPIQ were achieved by \u201cEthical issues in triage\u201d 3.9\u00b11.1, followed by \u201cemergency preparedness terms and activities\u201d 3.8\u00b10.8, and \u201cdecontamination\u201d 3.7\u00b11.1. The dimension that attained the lowest Mean\u00b1SD familiarity score for EPIQ was \u201caccessing critical resources and reporting\u201d 3.1\u00b11.1.\n\nThe results of this study could be used as a guide for making a strategic plan directed at adopting measures for disaster and emergency preparedness that can improve the quality of health care services. Moreover, there is a need to plan, design, and develop educational programs to enhance the knowledge of the healthcare providers in handling disastrous events efficiently. A comprehensively written emergency preparedness curriculum may also assist in assessing the training needs of healthcare providers. Moreover, additional studies on larger sample size should be conducted to provide data related to the need for such training amongest all ED staff including paramadics.\n\nIn conclusion, the present study concluded that the level of knowledge was satisfactory in healthcare providers with a neutral level of attitude, practice, and familiarity regarding disaster preparedness. Accordingly, incorporation of teaching courses (theories and practices) regarding disaster and emergency preparedness in ER staff curriculum is needed. In addition, future follow-up research studies are essential for capitalizing ED staff education and training in these critical areas applied to healthcare and community setting."}
