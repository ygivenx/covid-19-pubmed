{"title": "Aberrant coagulation causes a hyper-inflammatory response in severe influenza pneumonia", "body": "Coagulation is the formation of a blood clot. Coagulation is a highly ordered process that involves three components (endothelial cells, platelets and coagulation factors) in a sequential action of primary hemostasis, secondary hemostasis and fibrinolysis.21 Typically, coagulation is initiated by an injury to the vascular endothelial cells (ECs) (Figure 1b). Primary hemostasis is characterized by platelets that bind to injured and/or activated ECs and the immediate formation of a platelet plug (Figure 1c). Secondary coagulation has two separate initial pathways, the contact activation pathway (intrinsic pathway) and the tissue factor (TF) pathway (extrinsic pathway) (Figures 1d and e). Both pathways result in the production of factor X, which induces thrombin and the formation of fibrin strands to strengthen the platelet plug and form a stable platelet\u2013fibrin clot (Figures 1f and g). The coagulation process is tightly controlled by anticoagulants, which can limit the clot to avoid thrombus propagation, and fibrinolysis, which is responsible for the degradation of the platelet\u2013fibrin clot as the wound heals (Figures 1a and h).\n\nThrombosis, which often leads to hemorrhage, is a common clinical complication of severe influenza. Patients with a severe IAV infection, such as an H7N9 viral infection,6, 22 often show typical alterations of coagulation, including hyperemia of the alveolar wall, pulmonary capillary and small vessel thrombosis, fibrin deposition and DIC, and hemorrhage. The coagulation abnormalities (coagulopathy) are characterized by a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time and thrombin time, and decreased platelet counts in the blood in patients infected with H7N923, 24, 25 or highly pathogenic H5N1.26, 27 Both thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications were reported in the 2009 H1N1 influenza (\u2018swine flu'), such as microscopic thrombi, thromboemboli, pulmonary arterial thrombi and pulmonary hemorrhage with hemoptysis, hematemesis and petechial rash.28, 29, 30, 31 Thus, an influenza virus infection results in disorders, including both overactivated coagulation that leads to uncontrolled thrombosis and coagulopathy that leads to pulmonary hemorrhage and edema.\n\nThe overactivation of coagulation by influenza exacerbates the risk of pulmonary and cardiac diseases.32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37 IAV infections also cause a transient increased risk of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism,32 acute coronary syndromes,37 acute cardiac injury,38 acute myocardial infarction (AMI)39, 40 and other cardiovascular diseases.41, 42 For example, H1N1 infection elevates the expression of genes that promote hemostasis and/or platelet aggregation and the signature platelet genes associated with AMI.43 Such acute thrombosis in an already-diseased coronary artery can cause a subcritical level of stenosis attributable to the development of acute coronary syndromes.37 Therefore, reducing the risk of infection by vaccination against influenza effectively reduces the risk of stroke hospitalization,44 AMI rates39 and other cardiovascular events,45 with beneficial cardiovascular outcomes41 and increased survival among patients with acute heart failure.46 Clinical trials using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) have shown that a reduction in viral load is associated with a decrease in the incidence of cardiac disorders.47\n\nAnimal studies have partly explained the mechanism of activated coagulation by IAV infection.48, 49 IAV activates coagulation by increasing thrombin generation, fibrin deposition and fibrinolysis in C57BL/6 mice.48 D-dimer (a circulating marker for enhanced coagulation and fibrinolysis) concentrations and von Willebrand factor (vWF) activity are both increased in ferrets after infection with seasonal, pandemic or highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)-H5N1 viruses.49 The activation marker of coagulation thrombin\u2013antithrombin complex is increased in both pandemic and HPAI-H5N1 virus-infected ferrets, while intra-capillary fibrin deposition is especially evident in HPAI-H5N1 infection.49\n\nMore importantly, such a pro-thrombotic state induced by influenza virus infection will inevitably downregulate the anticoagulant components and inhibit fibrinolysis.33, 50, 51, 52 In turn, abnormal coagulation promotes hemorrhage and thrombosis, which is often associated with the overzealous inflammation observed during a severe IAV infection.20, 33, 53\n\nResting ECs provide a non-thrombogenic barrier that prevents the inappropriate activation of coagulation by producing numerous anticoagulant components and inhibiting platelet activation54 (Figure 1a). Once activated or injured, ECs initiate coagulation by activating platelets and the expression of coagulation components, as well as by down-regulating physiological anticoagulant components and suppressing fibrinolytic activity55 (Figure 1b). At the same time, the activation of ECs can result in an increase in local blood circulation, localized plasma leakage and the recruitment and activation of leukocytes to promote inflammation.56, 57 IAV can directly and/or indirectly induce EC activation and vascular hyperpermeability (Figure 2a). Certain IAV subtypes, such as H3N2 and H5N1, may infect lung endothelial cells, which also express \u03b12, 6-linked sialic acid and are adjacent to the primary target cells of the respiratory epithelia. Recognition of damage-associated molecular patterns, such as HMGB1 or oxidized phospholipids via TLR4, also activates ECs to drive lung injury.53, 58, 59 Direct stimulation of TLR3 by viral RNA results in the upregulation of TF and the downregulation of thrombomodulin in endothelial cells.60 Human IAV has been reported to induce pulmonary microvascular leakage through the degradation of the tight junction protein claudin-5.61\nIn vivo, D-dimer and tissue fibrin deposition are elevated.60\n\nInflammatory cytokines, produced by leukocytes, the lung epithelium and pulmonary endothelium, mainly contribute to endothelium dysfunction. Elevated TNF-\u03b1 levels have been shown to induce EC apoptosis. TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 can upregulate trypsin in ECs, which results in the loss of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1; a tight junction protein) and vascular hyperpermeability via protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2).62 Hypoxia, which is found in flu patients, contributes to EC activation to induce the release of pro-inflammatory IL-1, IL-6, platelet-activating factor (PAF), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), P-selectin and vWF.63 Thus, an IAV infection can induce pulmonary hemorrhage and alveolar edema through the activation and damage of ECs via several mechanisms, including direct damage, loss of tight junctions and hyperpermeability induced by inflammatory factors and the apoptosis of endothelial cells.\n\nAt the same time, the activation of and damage to ECs leads to the activation of the pro-coagulatory cascade. The expression of TF and vWF by activated ECs, the exposure of collagen to blood as a result of disruption of the endothelial barrier, and increased platelet binding to ECs induces platelet activation and aggregation, which then activates the extrinsic coagulation cascade (Figure 2b).21 EC activation reduces the expression or secretion of components of anticoagulation and fibrinolysis, and facilitates microthrombosis in the lung.18 Impaired coagulation then leads to DIC and triggers decompensated thrombocytopenia, which is induced by overactivation and excessive aggregation and passive exhaustion of platelets (discussed below). Pulmonary thrombosis results in passive congestion, limiting compensatory ventilation responses and then exacerbates vascular leakage and alveolar edema, contributing to widespread hemorrhaging, severe hypoxia, multiple organ failure and death during severe IAV infection (Figure 2d).64, 65, 66\n\nPulmonary ECs subsequently play a crucial role in the initiation and amplification of the cytokine storm during an IAV infection. By activating sphingosine-1-phosphate-1 (S1P1) signaling in the pulmonary endothelium, S1P1 receptor agonists (CYM-5442 and RP-002) inhibit the cytokine storms and protect the host from pathogenic influenza virus challenge.53 Moreover, IL-1R signaling and MyD88/TRIF signaling are necessary for the early amplification of the cytokine storm, and S1P1 receptor agonist treatment blunts the cytokine storm mainly by inhibiting the MyD88 signaling pathway.67 Innate cytokine and chemokine production and innate immune cell infiltration are separable events, with the pulmonary endothelium at the center of both processes.53 The innate immune cell infiltration is regulated by ECs, which express adhesion molecules (P-selectin, E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1) and facilitate the binding and migration of leukocytes during an influenza virus infection (Figure 2e).68, 69 An activated EC\u2013platelet\u2013leukocyte interaction feeds forward to amplify the overall inflammatory response (Figure 2e).18 Thus, pulmonary ECs might be a potential therapeutic target because of their critical role in the amplification of the cytokine storm.\n\nThe primary function of platelets is to sense the injured vessel endothelia and initiate blood clotting for hemostasis.70 Recent studies show that, in addition to their important roles in damage repair, platelets are also an integral part of the innate immune system as pro-inflammatory cells.71, 72, 73 After the activation of and damage to ECs, platelets are activated by numerous factors, including collagen, thromboxane A2, vWF, thrombin, ADP and pro-inflammatory cytokines or PAF (Figure 1c).52 Influenza virus H1N1 also activates platelets through Fc\u03b3RIIA on platelets by the IgG\u2013virus immune complex.52\n\nMoreover, activated platelets release a number of mediators and cytokines from stores within their \u03b1- and dense-granules for further platelet recruitment, activation and aggregation (Figure 1c). Platelets are major pro-inflammatory cells under inflammatory conditions.71, 74, 75, 76, 77 Upon activation, platelets change from smooth discs to spiny spheres and rapidly release inflammatory and coagulatory mediators stored in their granules and express a number of receptors for adhesion and clotting molecules.77 The interaction of P-selectin on activated platelets and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand expressed on neutrophils leads to the activation of neutrophils in the circulation and the redistribution of Mac-1 and CXCR2, which guide neutrophil intravascular crawling and transmigration and the initiation of inflammation (Figure 2e).69 Such platelet\u2013neutrophil aggregates contribute to a variety of inflammatory settings, including acute lung injury, acute hepatic injury, sepsis and atherosclerosis.78, 79, 80 Platelet\u2013neutrophil aggregation is also responsible for the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by neutrophils, modulating the phagocytic capacity of neutrophils and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (webs of extracellular DNA and histones).79, 80 Activated platelets also interact with T cells, B cells, NK cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes and induce their homing, activation and recruitment, and cytokine release (Figure 2e).81 More importantly, the cytokines and chemokines released from the activated platelets, including CD40L, IL-1\u03b2, CCL5, CXCL4, CXCL7 and TGF-\u03b2, are profoundly involved in the modulation of endothelial cell function, leukocyte trafficking and immune response (Figure 2c).81 For example, CD40L, released from activated platelets, can activate CD40 on endothelial cells to upregulate ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin and P-selectin and to release IL-6, MCP-1, CCL2 and TF, thereby promoting leukocyte recruitment to lesions and immune activation.82, 83, 84\n\nMassive infiltration of activated and aggregated platelets in the lungs may be associated with thrombocytopenia, which is often observed in highly pathogenic influenza virus infections but is rare for other human viruses, such as adenovirus, metapneumovirus, coronavirus or bocavirus infections.85 Thrombocytopenia has been observed in 73% of patients infected by avian origin H7N9 and is a risk factor for acute respiratory failure in H1N1 influenza.86, 87, 88 The overactivation of platelets by influenza viruses causes thrombosis in the lung, which can passively exhaust platelets, and lead to thrombocytopenia.20\n\nTherefore, blockade of platelet overactivation and aggregation can reduce the severity of acute respiratory syndrome.20 For example, the administration of the PAR-1 antagonist SCH79797, which inhibits the activation of platelets induced by thrombin, decreases inflammation and improves survival after IAV infection in mice.89 A deficiency in the major platelet receptor glycoprotein IIIa (GPIIIa) or treatment with anti-platelet compounds (eptifibatide, MRS 2179, clopidogrel, acetylsalicylic acid/aspirin and ticlopidine) protects mice from lethal influenza virus infection.20, 90 Aspirin also acts as an anti-influenza virus agent in vitro by inhibiting pro-inflammatory NF-\u03baB activity and improving the influenza outcome in vivo.91 However, whether aspirin inhibits platelet activation in vivo is controversial because it may have increased the mortality of the 1918\u20131919 pandemic influenza92 and influenza virus infection in animal models.93 Larger scale clinical studies are needed to exclude strain variation in influenza viruses, various antipyretic regimes and models of meta-analysis.94, 95 For example, treatment with aspirin and dicrofenac sodium aggravates the hematogenous spread of IAV to the central nervous system in chicken but does not affect transneural infection in mice.96 Interestingly, aspirin does not significantly increase mortality in an influenza B virus mouse model of Reye's syndrome.97 Aspirin and acetaminophen have the potential to exacerbate the consequences of influenza B virus infection in neonatal mice but not in weanling mice.98 Therefore, anti-platelet compounds should be explored as a potential treatment for influenza, but more studies are needed, and the data must be carefully interpreted.\n\nThe plasma coagulation cascade is primarily initiated by TF during an influenza infection.19 Under physiological conditions, TF is present in the sub-endothelial tissue, fibroblasts and circulatory blood cells or ECs do not express TF (Figure 1a). Inflammation caused by IAV infection causes disruption of the vessel walls that exposes TF to the circulation.33, 65 ECs and monocytes begin producing TF in response to various pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1) and pathogen-associated molecular pattern (such as viral RNA).60, 99 The coagulation cascade is initiated quickly once TF has been exposed to the blood (Figure 1d). The activated coagulation cascade generates thrombin protease (factor IIa), which converts fibrinogen into fibrin (Figure 1f). Thrombin is involved in the feedback activation of coagulation by activating coagulation factors V, VIII, XI and XIII (Figures 1e and f). As one of the strongest platelet activators, thrombin also induces platelet aggregation and clot formation.100 Furthermore, fibrinogen and fibrin also activate macrophages and cytokine production through TLR4.101, 102\n\nIn addition to their roles in coagulation, activated coagulatory factors, such as thrombin, FXa and FVIIa, also augment the initial inflammatory response. Treatment with a recombinant inhibitor of the FVIIa/TF complex attenuates the pro-inflammatory response and prolongs survival rates in a rhesus monkey model of Ebola hemorrhagic fever.103 The pro-inflammatory function of coagulation factors is mediated through their activation of PARs (PAR-1, -2, -3 and -4), which are mainly expressed in platelets and other cell types, including ECs, macrophages, mast cells, eosinophils, myocytes and gastrointestinal and bronchial epithelial cells.19, 89, 104 PAR-1, -3 and -4 are activated by thrombin, whereas PAR-2 is activated by FVIIa and FXa but not by thrombin. PAR-1 is also responsible for FXa signaling.19 PAR signaling activates ECs, platelets and leukocytes to express pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and increases the permeability of ECs and the adhesion and chemotaxis of leukocytes (Figure 2b).19 The TF/thrombin/PAR-1 pathway promotes the deleterious innate inflammatory response to an influenza virus infection in mice.89, 104 PAR-2 plays both a protective and a pathogenic role in response to an H1N1 infection.105, 106 The activation of PAR-4 exacerbates acute lung injury, inflammation and death through platelet activation and a PAR-4 antagonist (pepducin p4pal-10) protects mice during influenza virus infection.20 Taken together, these results suggest that coagulation factors mainly play pathogenic roles through PAR-1 and PAR-4, which may serve as therapeutic targets against IAV infection.\n\nTo keep the platelet activation and coagulation cascade in check, coagulation is well regulated by three major anticoagulant mechanisms, which are protein C (PC), antithrombin (AT) and the tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI; Figure 1a).107 A deficiency in anticoagulants may result in acquired thrombophilia, a condition in which there is an increased tendency to form blood clots.\n\nPC, a major endogenous anticoagulant, is activated by thrombin.108 Activated PC cleaves the activated FVa and FVIIIa to inhibit the coagulation cascades.108 In addition to its anti-coagulatory role, activated PC also exerts anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine production and leukocyte infiltration.109, 110, 111, 112, 113 Reduced PC, on the other hand, increases the generation of thrombin during an influenza virus infection.48 However, because of the complex network that regulates coagulation, contradictory effects of PC are often observed in lethal H1N1 influenza in mice: while it can inhibit inflammation and pulmonary coagulopathy, it also facilitates neutrophil influx and protein leakage into the bronchoalveolar.114, 115 Additionally, anti-PC antibody treatment results in delayed mortality,114 but recombinant activated PC treatment does not affect the outcome.115 Therefore, the function of PC during influenza virus infection remains uncertain.\n\nAT (also known as antithrombin III) is a serine protease inhibitor produced by the liver. AT functions as an anticoagulant by inhibiting thrombin, as well as FXa, FIXa, FIa and FXIIa, and its activity is increased by heparin.116 By binding to thrombin, AT directly suppresses the activation of pro-inflammatory cells (leukocytes, ECs and platelets).117 Furthermore, AT inhibits leukocyte rolling, adhesion and activation directly by binding to receptors on the leukocyte or indirectly by endothelial cell-released PGI(2) that tethers AT to cell surface glycosaminoglycan.118, 119 Of further interest, AT possesses antiviral activity against HIV,120, 121 HSV122, 123 and HCV.124 The antiviral activities of AT reside in its serine protease inhibitor activity against the hemagglutinin of influenza A virus H1N1 in vitro and in vivo.125 In line with this, several proteases (Gzma, Tmprss4, Elane, Ctrl, Gzmc and Gzmb) are upregulated in the lung after mice are infected with the H1N1 virus, and treatment with serine protease inhibitors protects mice from the fatal infection.126\n\nTFPI is another serine protease inhibitor present in endothelia and platelets. By targeting the TF-FVIIa complex, it inhibits coagulation cascades and modulates platelet pro-coagulant activity.127 However, the function of TFPI in inflammation or viral infection remains largely unknown.\n\nADAMTS13 is an anticoagulant protease that cleaves vWF. It is produced in liver stellate cells and endothelial cells and is also present in platelets. Systemic inflammation reduces ADAMTS13 activity,128 resulting in the formation of high-molecular weight vWF multimers and increased platelet activation.129 Acute IAV infections reduce the level of ADAMTS13 and elevate the level of anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies, which are associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.35, 36 A markedly high ratio of vWF to ADAMTS13 in the circulation has been found in H1N1 influenza patients with thrombotic microangiopathy.51 The decreased level of ADAMTS13 might result from the influenza virus-induced cytokine storm. However, whether ADAMTS13 takes part in the initiation and amplification of the inflammatory response is unknown.\n\nCoagulation is resolved by fibrinolysis, a process that involves a distinct enzymatic cascade. In the physiological state, fibrinolysis is initiated by three serine proteases: tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and kallikrein (Figure 1h).130 uPA and tPA initiate the conversion of the zymogen plasminogen to the serine proteinase plasmin, which dissolves the polymerized fibrin strands. Fibrinolysis is regulated by other molecules, including \u03b12-antiplasmin, \u03b12-macroglobulin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor.131 In addition to its fibrinolysis activity, plasmin plays a critical role in a variety of processes, including inflammation.132, 133 Plasminogen binds to different receptors on monocytes, macrophages, DCs and other immune cells and generates plasmin, which is responsible for the migration and recruitment of inflammatory immune cells to lesions and subsequently stimulates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and ROS.132 In fact, excessive activation of plasmin exacerbates the pathogenesis of different inflammatory diseases.132\n\nPlasminogen and plasmin play critical roles in the infectivity of influenza viruses. The proteolytic cleavage of HA by trypsin-like proteases in the respiratory tract can process the HA precursor protein into two disulfide bond-linked subunits, HA1 and HA2. This is an essential step in the life cycle and is required for IAV infectivity.134 Influenza viruses use the conversion of plasminogen into plasmin, and the latter possesses a trypsin-like protease activity to cleave HA (Figure 3b).135, 136 Moreover, mini-plasmin, which is generated by the sequential processing of plasminogen by a plasminogen activator and elastases, has been found in the epithelial cells of the bronchioles and is reported to process HA.137 The accumulation of mini-plasmin in the cerebral capillaries has also been implicated in influenza encephalitis.138, 139 Therefore, plasminogen-dependent cleavage of HA is used by influenza viruses to increase their replication rates and infectivity (Figure 3b). On the other hand, the binding of NA of the influenza virus A/WSN/33 to plasminogen helps to sequestrate plasminogen on the cell surface and increases the cleavage of HA. This further helps in the dissemination of the virus and the efficient replication of IAV in the brains of mice.135, 136 Binding of plasminogen to NA seems to rely on the unique sequence motif of the WSN strain.135 The activation of plasminogen also helps with the replication of other influenza virus strains in an NA-independent fashion. In this case, annexin II of the host cell binds to plasminogen and activates HA cleavage.134, 140, 141 Moreover, viral HA itself seems to be able to recruit plasminogen for HA cleavage.142 Bacterial staphylokinase can activate plasminogen to plasmin and thereby induce cleavage of HA of the MS96 (H9N2) virus. This mechanism may partly explain why bacterial infection can enhance influenza infectivity.143\n\nPlasminogen not only facilitates the infection of IAV but also contributes to the pathogenicity of the viral infection.144 Fibrinolysis (fibrinogen degradation) is one of the underlying mechanisms of plasminogen-driven lung inflammation and mortality. A blockade of plasminogen fibrinolysis by 6-aminohexanoic acid (6-AHA) treatment, for example, protects mice from influenza virus lethality.144 Increased vascular permeability, induced by plasminogen, helps in the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the site of IAV infection and also contributes to the inflammation response.144 Plasminogen might also interact with PAR-1 to decrease survival and increase lung inflammation after an influenza infection.89\n\nPAI-1, encoded by the SERPINE1 gene, is a serine protease inhibitor that inhibits the activation of tPA and uPA and, hence, fibrinolysis (Figure 1h).145 Recently, PAI-1 was identified as an unconventional ISG that targets extracellular airway proteases to inhibit viral glycoprotein cleavage and reduce the infectivity of progeny viruses in vitro and in vivo (Figure 3a).146 Influenza virus infection can increase the production of PAI-1 from ECs and airway epithelial cells, which inhibits the spread of the IAV.146, 147 Increased PAI-1 expression may not protect hosts against an IAV infection under certain circumstances; for example, passive cigarette smoke exposure can induce PAI-1 expression, but it promotes alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis and exacerbates lung inflammation after an IAV infection.148\n\nBacterial superinfection during influenza, primarily by Streptococcus pneumoniae, often results in hospitalization and even the death of patients.149, 150, 151 IAV-S. pneumoniae co-infection in mice causes a markedly more severe disease and hyper-activation of coagulation compared with IAV infection alone.64 Widespread pulmonary thrombosis and the extensive expression of TF on the endothelial, epithelial and immune cells is found in the lung sections of S. pneumoniae-positive 1918 H1N1 autopsies and co-infected mice.64 A secondary S. pneumoniae infection is held accountable for the overexpression of TF, the initiation of the coagulation cascade and thrombus formation, which contribute to severe hypoxia and death.64\n\nUnlike the pathogenic bacterial superinfection, the colonization of commensal bacteria or pretreatment with probiotic bacteria can dampen influenza-mediated acute lung injury. Staphylococcus aureus, one of the most common commensal bacterium colonized in the airways, induces the polarization of M2 alveolar macrophages and inhibits the lethal inflammatory response to an IAV infection.152 Furthermore, both oral and nasal pretreatment with the probiotic lactic acid bacteria strains (Lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL1505) protects mice from PR8 lethality.153, 154 Pretreatment with L. rhamnosus significantly reduces coagulatory activation mainly through the downregulation of TF and the restoration of thrombomodulin levels.154 Taken together, these studies show that bacteria in the airways affect the outcome of IAV pneumonia, and precise targeting of the bacteria should be considered in the treatment of influenza.\n\nInfluenza virus infection causes excessive activation of ECs and platelets, which triggers a coagulation cascade with concurrently impaired anti-coagulatory and fibrinolytic signaling. Such a pro-coagulant state can cause hemorrhagic fever and is often associated with ARDS in severe flu patients. The aberrant coagulation system contributes to the severity of influenza at multiple levels. The activated ECs and platelets first produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that enhance inflammatory cell infiltration and increase vascular permeability. Platelets are further activated under these circumstances. Second, coagulation factors are activated, which further augment the inflammation via PARs on ECs, platelets and leukocytes. Third, the expression of anticoagulant components decreases as the ECs are activated. And last, fibrinolytic proteases (such as plasmin) are activated by the upregulated coagulation, which has been hijacked by the influenza virus for viral replication and infectivity.\n\nUnderstanding the cellular and molecular events of coagulation will contribute to the development of more precise therapeutics against IAV infections. Drugs that target endothelial cell activation (S1P1 agonists CYM-5442 and RP-002), anti-platelet agents (eptifibatide, aspirin, MRS 2179 and clopidogrel), anticoagulants (recombinant activated PC and Ancrod) and protease inhibitors (6-AHA, PAI-1 and aprotinin155) effectively hamper pathogenic IAV infection in mice. Nevertheless, the detailed mechanisms of how coagulation contributes to the pathogenesis of severe influenza, especially in humans, remains to be investigated. A better understanding of coagulatory homeostasis would definitely benefit the development of more precise treatments for epidemic and pandemic influenza."}
