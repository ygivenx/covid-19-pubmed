{"title": "Feline CD 4 molecules expressed on feline non-lymphoid cell lines are not enough for productive infection of highly lymphotropic feline immunodeficiency virus isolates Brief R e p o r t", "body": "To investigate whether the feline CD 4 (fCD 4) molecules are involved in infections of highly lymphotropic feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) isolates, we expressed fCD 4 stably on Crandell feline kidney cells and Felis catus whole foetus 4 cells by transfection of a cDNA encoding the fCD 4 glycoprotein, and then infected them with TM 1 and TM 2 strains of FIV, which are unable to infect these cells productively. In spite of fCD 4 being expressed on these cells, no virus production was observed. This result indicates that fCD 4 expression alone cannot induce a productive infection of the FIV TM 1 and TM 2 strains.\n\nThe CD 4 molecule is a major receptor for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) [-6, 12, 13, 15] , but the other molecules are also implicated in CD4independent infection [-3, 7, 8, 26, 30] . Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is an etiological agent of the acquired immunodeficiency-like diseases in cats [25] . Whether the FIV utilizes feline CD 4 (fCD 4) molecules as a receptor or not is unknown at present. However, the decrease of fCD 4/feline CD 8 (fCD 8) T cell ratio after experimental infection of cats with FIV was reported [2, 23] . In addition, our FIV isolates, TM 1 and TM 2 strains can productively infect fCD 4 + fCD 8-MYA-1 cells but not fCD 4 -fCD 8-FL 74 cells [ 14, [17] [18] [19] [20] . There are some other Japanese isolates which are also infectious to fCD4 + fCD 8-cell line (Fel-039 cells) [31] . These results imply that fCD4 is one of the candidate molecules for the FIV receptor. On the other hand, it has been reported that both CD 4 + and CD 8 + cells were productively infected with FIV in vitro [4] . Furthermore, Yamamoto et al. [32] reported that Crandell feline kidney (CRFK) cells were also productively infected by a Petaluma strain of FIV. However, we could not detect any virus production in fCD 4-negative CRFK and Felis catus whole foetus 4 (fcwf-4) cells by infection with cell-free FIV TM 1 or TM 2 strain. These contradictory results may be due to the difference in the host range between these virus strains.\n\nTo clarify the role of fCD 4 on FIV infection, we used feline CD 4 cDNA, termed as FT 121 which had been cloned in a previous study [21] . In the present study, we established CRFK and fcwf-4 cells on which fCD 4 molecules were stably expressed by transfection of the expression plasmid containing FT 121 and selective marker gene. The purpose of the present study is to examine the role of fCD 4 on infection of FIV TM 1 and TM 2 strains, using these fCD 4 expressing cells.\n\nC R F K [5] and fcwf-4 [9] cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum (FCS) and antibiotics. MYA-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 growth medium supplemented with 10% FCS, antibiotics, 50 gM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2~tg/ml polybrene and 100 units/ml of recombinant human interleukin-2 at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. For preparation of virus stocks of FIV TM 1 and TM 2 strains, MYA-1 cells were infected with a low passaged FIV TM 1 or TM 2 strain, and then the supernate was harvested after 8 day-incubation when the virus titer reached a plateau [11] . These stock viruses were passed through a 0.45 gm Milipore filter and stored at -80 \u00b0C in 1 ml aliquots until use. The titration of the stock viruses was carried out as described previously [11] .\n\nTo express the fCD4 (FT 121) in CRFK and fcwf-4 cells, we chose Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) long terminal repeat (LTR) for the promoter of the gene because of the strong activity of the RSV LTR in the cells [22] . Eco RI-linked FT 121 was blunted and inserted into blunted Hin dIII site of pRVSVneo [28] , which contained neo resistant gene under the control of simian virus 40 early gene promoter. This expression plasmid was designated as pRVSVfCD 4neo. The construction of the plasmid was shown in Fig. 1 .\n\nTo establish the C R F K and fcwf-4 cells which stably express the fCD 4, CRFK, and fcwf-4 cells grown in six-well dishes were transfected with 5 gg of pRVSVfCD 4neo DNA by the phosphate calcium coprecipitation method [28] . Two days after transfection, the cell medium was replaced with the one containing 200 gg/ml G 418 (Geneticin; Gibco, BRL Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, U.S.A.). The selected cells were maintained in the medium with the same concentration of G 418. For examination of fCD 4 expression, the cells (Fig. 2) . The fCD 4-expressed C R F K and fcwf-4 cells were referred to Cf4 and if4 cells, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2 (flow cytometric analysis) and Fig. 3 (indirect immunofluorescence assay, IFA), the efficiency of fCD 4 expression varied in each cell. This variation was thought to have been caused by the heterogenous population of the cells, because these cells had not been cloned. Maddon et al. reported the HeLa cells stably expressing CD 4, which were permissive for productive infections of HIV-1 [13] . In this case, the cells were cloned cells and CD 4 expression was very high. We did not clone the transfected cells, however, the expression efficiency of fCD 4 as observed in Cf4 and ff4 cells seemed to be sufficient for the infection assay for FIV, as long as the virus uses fCD 4 efficiently as the receptor. Next, we examined the virus susceptibility of these cells. CRFK, fcwf-4, Cf4 and if4 cells were infected with FIV TM 1 or TM 2 strain at an moi of 0.3 TCIDs0. The cells were passaged by 0.2% trypsin treatments and washed every 6 or 7 days. Twenty days after inoculation, the culture supernate was inoculated to MYA-1 cell cultures for the virus rescue. Simultaneously, these cells were cocultured with MYA-1 cells. Twenty day-incubation period was enough to avoid residual virus contamination from the inoculum used, because these isolates were known to be completely inactivated within a 14-day incubation at 37\u00b0C as previously reported [10] . The MYA-1 cells were periodically ex- Indirect stains were visualized with a rabbit anti-mouse IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate for 30 rain on ice amined for virus production by the IFA [16, 17] and the reverse transcriptase (RT) assay [24] . Though this experiment was repeated more than 5 times, we could not detect any evidence for virus production of FIV TM 1 or TM 2 strain (data not shown). Furthermore, we investigated the possibility of the cDNA synthesis of FIV in these cells. For detection of viral cDNA, we used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method using the primer flanking the part of gag gene of FIV. To avoid the viral DNA contamination, stock virus was treated with 200 gg/ ml of DNase (Boehringer Mannheim Yamanouchi, Co., Tokyo, Japan) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C before inoculation. For virus infection, the cells were incubated with the DNase-treated virus for 15 h and washed in PBS three times. Five days after infection, FIV inoculated cells were harvested, and the cells were washed in PBS, lysed in proteinase K buffer (100 mM Tris-HC1 pH 7.5, 12.5 mM EDTA, 150M NaC1, 1% SDS, 200 gg/ml proteinase K) and then subjected to phenolchloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The resultant total DNAs were subjected to PCR amplification.\n\nFor amplification of a gag fragment of FIV TM 1 and TM 2 strains, the primer 5'-CTGGTGATCCTACTTCTTGGCAGGC-3', nucleotides 1687--1663, was designed as an antisense primer, and the primer 5'-CTAGGAGGTGAGGAGGTCCAACTGTG-3', nucleotides 1126-.1151, Fig. 3 . Indirect immunofluorescence assay, a Cf4 cells, b CRFK cells, c ff4 cells, d fcwf-4 cells. Cells were reacted with the anti-feline CD 4 monoclonal antibody (Fel 7), and then with a a-mouse IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate as a sense primer. The sequences of primers were derived from the sequence of FIV TM 2 strain [14] . PCR was carried out by the method of Saiki et al. [27] in a 50 lal volume overlaid with an equal volume of mineral oil. A GeneAmp PCR Reagent kit (Perkin Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, U.S.A.) was used for the reactions. Amplification proceeded for 30 cycles in a Thermal Cyclic Reactor Model TC-100 (Hoei Science Co., Tokyo, Japan). One cycle consisted of incubations at 94, 58, and 72\u00b0C for 1, 1, and 2min, respectively. After amplification, 10 gl of the 50 gl-reaction were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel (in Tris-borate-EDTA buffer). Fractionated DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane, and cross-linked by UV. Hybridization was carried out for 18 h at 50 \u00b0C in a solution containing 50% formamide, 6 x SSC (1 x SSC: 0.15M NaC1 and 0.015 M sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS, 5 x Denhardt's solution, 100 ~tg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA and the 32p-labelled probe DNA. The amplified DNA from TM 2 clone was used as a probe DNA. Figure 4 shows the results of the PCR analysis. The cDNA of FIV gag gene was detected in the MYA-1 cells infected with FIV TM 1. However, we could not detect any positive band in the CRFK, fcwf-4, Cf4 and ff4 cells infected with the virus. Similar results were obtained for the FIV TM 2 (data not shown).\n\nThe data obtained in this study revealed that FIV TM 1 and TM 2 strains cannot infect either of the cells irrespective of the fCD 4 expression on the cells. Therefore, we concluded that fCD 4 expression on CRFK and fcwf-4 cells is not sufficient for the induction of a productive infection of FIV TM 1 and TM 2 strains. An FIV DNA clone containing a full length of TM 1 or TM 2 strain produces the virus in CRFK and fcwf-4 cells by gene-transfection [14, 19; Miyazawa et al., unpubl, data] . Therefore, we considered that the failure of FIV TM 1 and TM 2 strains to infect the cells was due to the blockage at an early stage of infection, such as the viral adsorption, penetration, and cDNA synthesis. From our data, it is unlikely that fCD 4 alone is involved in the infection of highly lymphotropic FIV such as TM 1 or TM 2 isolate, and it is likely that some other molecules participate in virus-cell interaction, in addition to fCD 4. However, at the moment we cannot exclude the possibility that the FIV TM 1 and TM 2 strains can penetrate in the cells and the incomplete cDNA synthesis of the virus occurs as reported in the case of the HIV-1 infection in stationary cells [29] or quiescent primary lymphocytes [33, 34] ."}
