An accumulation of data, such as antimicrobial drug susceptibilities and observation of atypical bacteria in intestinal macrophages, has suggested that this disease is an infectious disease. Tropheryma whipplei is recognized as the infectious agent responsible for Whipple disease (2). Recent studies using molecular biology (3\u20135) and culture-dependent (6\u201310) techniques have enabled the T. whipplei genome to be fully sequenced (11,12) and have resulted in development of new culture media (13), selection of highly sensitive primers for quantitative PCR (14), and genotyping (15\u201319). The bacterium is found in a viable form in stools of infected patients (9).\n\nUntil recently, T. whipplei was considered a rare bacterium that caused an uncommon disease (2). However, recent studies have confirmed that T. whipplei is common in stool samples (20,21). T. whipplei DNA has been detected in sewage and is highly prevalent in the feces of sewer workers (12%\u201326%) (1,20,22\u201325). Moreover, the prevalence of T. whipplei in feces of healthy children 2\u201310 years of age who lived in rural Senegal (sub-Saharan Africa) was 44% (46/105) (21). These data, together with the genetic heterogeneity of T. whipplei (19), indicate that T. whipplei is a rather common gut bacterium.\n\nWe hypothesize that T. whipplei may cause gastroenteritis in children as a result of its primary contact with humans. In a preliminary study, we tested all patients with diarrhea at the University Hospitals in Marseille, France, and determined that this bacterium was found most often in children 2\u20134 years of age (26).\n\nTo investigate whether T. whipplei caused gastroenteritis, we studied the prevalence of T. whipplei DNA in a prospective study of children with diarrhea and controls with diarrhea. We genotyped T. whipplei to identify circulating clones (9) and report overall findings, including data from the preliminary study.\n\nThe study was reviewed and approved by the local ethics committee (agreement no. 07\u2013006). A case-patient was defined as a child 2\u20134 years of age who had 2 positive quantitative PCR results specific for 2 T. whipplei DNA sequences, as reported (14,20). From January 2006 through December 2008, we tested 241 stool samples from 241 children with diarrhea at 2 University Hospitals for children in Marseille, France (Timone and Nord Hospitals) using a T. whipplei\u2013specific PCR. Samples were obtained from all children in accordance with routine hospital procedures. All stools samples were handled identically. Among 36 children with gastroenteritis and T. whipplei DNA in stools, 11 stool specimens from 10 children were obtained after their recovery from diarrheal illness.\n\nFive stool specimens were tested \u224815 days later and 6 were sampled \u22481 month later. Eight serum samples from children with gastroenteritis and positive PCR results for T. whipplei were tested retrospectively for T. whipplei by Western blot analysis. Data for patients with a definite diagnosis of Whipple disease and positive PCR results for T. whipplei PCR in stools at the time of diagnosis and data for adult asymptomatic carriers of T. whipplei in stools, which have been reported (14,20), were also included for quantitative comparisons.\n\nAll T. whipplei\u2013infected case-patients were compared with 67 gastroenteritis case-patients of the same age. These 67 children had negative results for T. whipplei in stool specimens; epidemiologic, clinical, and biologic features were available for these children.\n\nForty-seven stool specimens from children 2\u20134 years of age without gastroenteritis were also tested for T. whipplei by using PCR. Twenty-five children (11 girls and 14 boys) were from kindergarten classrooms at the university hospitals. Samples were also obtained from 10 children (4 boys and 6 girls) hospitalized at Timone Hospital for surgery and from 12 children (5 boys and 7 girls) who visited the Emergency Department of Nord Hospital.\n\nTwenty-five serum samples obtained from children 2\u20134 year of age with gastroenteritis and T. whipplei\u2013negative results in stool specimens were tested retrospectively. Twenty control serum samples were obtained from 20 children 1\u201336 months of age with a disease other than gastroenteritis. All serum samples were from children hospitalized in the 2 University Hospitals. These samples were obtained for routine management of these patients, not specifically for our study.\n\nBacteria, viruses, and Giardia duodenalis were detected by using standard methods. Stool specimens were plated onto Hektoen, Campylosel, and Yersinia cefsulodin\u2013irgasan\u2013novobiocin agar plates (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy L\u2019Etoile, France). Plates selective for Campylobacter spp. were incubated under microaerophilic conditions; all other media and samples were incubated in ambient air. Temperature of incubation was 37\u00b0C, with the exception of Yersinia agar, which was incubated at 30\u00b0C. Length of incubation was 5 days. For virus tests, stool specimens were tested by using a chromatographic immunoassay with a VIKIA Rota-Adeno Kit (bioM\u00e9rieux) kit and electron microscopy with negative staining, which enabled detection of rotavirus, adenovirus, calicivirus, astrovirus, Norwalk virus, coronavirus, and enterovirus. G. duodenalis was detected by PCR, as described (27).\n\nT. whipplei quantitative PCR assays of stool samples were performed as reported (14,20,28). Approximately 1 g of stool was obtained for DNA extraction by using the QIAamp DNA MiniKit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), which was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. The first T. whipplei\u2013specific quantitative PCR specific for a 155-bp sequence used primer pair TW27 forward (5\u2032-TGTTTTGTACTGCTTGTAACAGGATCT-3\u2032) and TW182 reverse (5\u2032-TCCTGCTCTATCCCTCCTATCATC-3\u2032) and a Taqman probe (27 forward\u2013182 reverse, 5\u2032-6-FAM-AGAGATACATTTGTGTTAGTTGTTACA-TAMRA-3\u2032). The PCR was conducted in a LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France) (14,20,28) in a final volume of 20 \u00b5L that contained 10 \u00b5L of the probe, master kit (QIAGEN), 0.5 \u00b5L (10 pmol/\u00b5L) of each primer, 5 \u00b5L (2 \u00b5mol/\u00b5L) of probe, 2 \u00b5L of distilled water, and 2 \u00b5L of extracted DNA. The amplification conditions involved an initial denaturation step at 95\u00b0C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 s, and annealing and elongation at 60\u00b0C for 60 s, with fluorescence acquisition in single mode. After every 5 samples, T. whipplei\u2013negative controls (water, mixture, and human samples) were evaluated.\n\nIf the result of the first PCR was positive, it was systematically confirmed by a second PCR with a second set of primer pairs: TW13 forward (5\u2032-TGAGTGATGGTAGTCTGAGAGATATGT-3\u2032) and TW163 reverse (5\u2032-TCCATAACAAAGACAACAACCAATC-3\u2032). This second PCR used a Taqman probe (13 forward\u2013163 reverse, 5\u2032-6-FAM-AGAAGAAGATGTTACGGGTTG-TAMRA-3\u2032) specific for a different 150-bp sequence, as described elsewhere; the same amplification conditions described above were used. For quantitative PCR, sequence-specific standard curves were generated by using 10-fold serial dilutions of a standard concentration of 106 microorganisms of the Marseille-Twist T. whipplei strain. The number of transcript copies in each sample was then calculated from the standard curve by using LightCycler software.\n\nGenotyping of T. whipplei from stool specimens was performed as reported (19). This analysis was specific for 4 highly variable genomic sequences (HVGS) and used primers TWT133 forward and reverse for HVGS 1, primers ProS forward and reverse for HVGS 2, primers SECA forward and reverse for HVGS 3, and primers TWT183 forward and reverse for HVGS 4. PCR was performed in a PTC-200 automated thermal cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA, USA), as reported (19).\n\nSerologic assays were performed by using Western blotting as described (29). Before blotting, protein concentration was determined by using a commercial reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). T. whipplei Twist proteins were resuspended in Laemmli buffer (Sigma-Aldrich Chimie, Saint Quentin Fallavier, France) containing 100 mmol/L dithiothreitol to obtain a final protein concentration of 0.5 \u00b5g/\u00b5L. The protein lysate was heated for 5 min at 100\u00b0C. Five micrograms of native protein was loaded into wells of a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel, and proteins were resolved by sodium dodecyl sufate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.\n\nProteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Transblot Transfer Medium, Pure Nitrocellulose Membrane, 0.45 mm; Bio-Rad) over a 2-hour period by using a semidry transfer unit (Hoeffer TE 77; GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). Membranes were immersed in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.2% Tween 20 and 5% non-fat dry milk (blocking buffer) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with primary serum (dilution 1:1,000 in blocking buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then washed in triplicate with phosphate-buffered saline\u2013Tween 20, and immunoreactive spots were detected by incubating the membranes for 1 h at room temperature with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human antibody (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA) diluted 1:1,000 in blocking buffer. The first screening was performed by testing for all immunoglobulins (Igs). Positive cases were then tested to separately detect IgG and IgM. Detection was performed by using chemiluminescence (Enhanced Chemiluminescence Western Blotting Analysis System; Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) with an automated film processor (Hyperprocessor; GE Healthcare).\n\nData were analyzed by using EpiInfo software version 3.4.1 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA). Proportions were compared by using the Yates \u03c72 corrected test or Fisher exact test. Continuous variables were compared by using analysis of variance or the Mann-Whitney/Wilcoxon 2-sample test when data were not normally distributed. Significance was defined as p<0.05.\n\nA total of 241 children 2\u20134 years of age with gastroenteritis were tested, and samples from 36 (15%) were positive for T. whipplei. In 2006, 2007, and 2008, the infection rates for T. whipplei were comparable: 12/78 (15.4%), 10/72 (14%), and 14/91 (15.4%), respectively. No seasonal variation was observed. None of the children in the same age control group without diarrhea had samples positive for T. whipplei (0/47; p = 0.008). High bacterial loads (>104/g of stool) were observed in 64% (23/36) of the T. whipplei\u2013positive children. Such high loads have not been observed in chronic carriers, but they were comparable to the levels for patients with Whipple disease (14). Bacterial load in stools ranged from 170 to 1.5 \u00d7 106/g (mean \u00b1 SD 1.5 \u00d7 105 \u00b1 3.6 \u00d7 105) for children with gastroenteritis versus 85 to 2.5 \u00d7 106/g (mean \u00b1 SD 5.5 \u00d7 105 \u00b1 8.3 \u00d7 105) for patients with Whipple disease (p = 0.1). Only 1 postdiarrheal stool specimen was slightly positive 15 days later and had a bacterial load <85/g of stool; the bacterial load was 2 \u00d7 104 at the time of diarrhea. Stool samples obtained from the same patient 1 month later were negative by PCR.\n\nGenotyping of T. whipplei was performed for 34 children with diarrhea. A dendogram showing phylogenetic organization of genotypes is shown in Figure 1. We observed genetic heterogeneity in sequences associated with gastroenteritis and identified 12 new genotypes. One useful finding was that genotype 3 was detected in 10 of the 34 children. Using Western blotting, we found that case-patients with Whipple disease were significantly more likely to be seropositive than controls with diarrhea (Figure 2) for IgG (7/8 vs. 5/25; p = 0.001) and IgM (7/8 vs. 1/25; p<0.001) and than controls without gastroenteritis for IgG (5/20; p = 0.004) and IgM (1/20; p<0.001).\n\nClinical and biological features of the 36 PCR-positive children 2\u20134 years of age with diarrhea were compared by retrospective review with those of matched 67 control children of the same age who had gastroenteritis but were negative for T. whipplei by PCR. Results are summarized in Table 1. Among children with positive PCR results, the proportion of girls and boys was equal. T. whipplei PCR-positive patients with diarrhea had a milder illness than PCR-negative patients. Length of rehydration required, duration of fever, and duration of hospitalization were significantly shorter for the patients infected with T. whipplei (p = 0.003, p = 0.003, and p = 0.01, respectively). Moreover, the level of C-reactive protein was significantly lower incase-patients (p = 0.03). Patients with T. whipplei were less likely to experience anorexia (p = 0.03); however, their weight loss was significant (p = 0.045). Another significant difference was increased contact with sand boxes for case-patients (p = 0.002); however, the size of the group analyzed was small, and these data should be confirmed.\n\nChildren infected with T. whipplei were co-infected with an associated pathogen more often than patients with diarrhea without T. whipplei infection (13/36 vs. 36/205; p = 0.01) (Table 2). Co-infection was less common in 23 children with high T. whipplei bacterial loads (>104/g of stool) than in 13 children with lower bacterial loads (5/23 vs. 8/13; p = 0.02).\n\nT. whipplei has been identified by PCR in stools of persons without Whipple disease (20). The source of T. whipplei is unknown, but data suggest that it the infection may result from fecal\u2013oral or oral\u2013oral transmission (2,20). T. whipplei is excreted in a live form by patients with Whipple disease (9), and T. whipplei DNA is found in stool samples of healthy persons (22). This bacterium is commonly found in sewers (20,23) and has also been detected in sewage (25). Therefore, it appears that T. whipplei is much more common than previously believed. A total of 3.8% (7/299) of adult controls in our study were PCR positive for T. whipplei (14). The bacterial load of T. whipplei in stools is much lower in asymptomatic carriers than in patients with Whipple disease (14,20).\n\nWe believe that our data provide strong evidence to support our initial hypothesis that T. whipplei causes mild gastroenteritis in children 2\u20134 years of age. All of our case-patients had 2 quantitative PCR-positive results, and genotyping of T. whipplei from 32 children enabled us to identify 12 new genotypes. Our data exclude the possibility of PCR contamination. We also found bacterial loads higher than those in previous reports of chronic carriers (20). However, these loads were comparable with those for patients with active Whipple disease (14). These high loads suggest that gastroenteritis in the children in our study was associated with active T. whipplei replication.\n\nThe absence of T. whipplei DNA in stools after patient recovery from diarrheal illness strongly suggests that detection of T. whipplei DNA is associated with acute gastroenteritis rather than carriage, which is usually chronic (20). Moreover, 1 genotype (genotype 3) predominated, causing one third of the total number of cases.\n\nSerologic analysis by Western blotting for T. whipplei (29) showed that all children who were PCR positive for T. whipplei had IgM against T. whipplei, which suggested that recent seroconversion had occurred. The prevalence of antibodies in case-patients was higher than that in controls. Comparison of the prevalence of antibodies for control children (22%) with preliminary prevalence data for persons 61 \u00b1 3.6 years of age (45%) (30) showed that the difference is significant (p<0.001); thus, possible acquired immunity to infection with T. whipplei may explain why this bacterium causes diarrhea in children, but not in most adults.\n\nWe suspect that T. whipplei infection is contagious and transmitted by the fecal\u2013oral route in children 2\u20134 years of age with other enteric pathogens. We previously reported an association between G. duodenalis infection and Whipple disease (27). As with other organisms such as Helicobacter pylori, T. whipplei may also be transmitted through saliva because it has been found in saliva of asymptomatic carriers and patients with Whipple disease (20). Therefore, we hypothesized that primary infection with T. whipplei in children may result in gastroenteritis, especially when associated with other intestinal pathogens. We have provided several lines of evidence that T. whipplei is causing or exacerbating gastroenteritis. The incidence of T. whipplei DNA in stools of children 2\u20134 years of age with gastroenteritis was higher than that in the control group; these infected children also have higher levels of antibodies. That healthy children of the same ages were not infected with T. whipplei also suggests that primary infection is symptomatic. Sociodemographic differences between the 2 groups could theoretically explain our findings. However, most of our patients and controls were from the same geographic area, which enabled us to rule out this hypothesis.\n\nWe identified 1 clone (genotype 3) in 10 children, which indicates that this clone is circulating in our population. The association we found between T. whipplei and other pathogens transmitted by the fecal\u2013oral route supports the conclusion that T. whipplei and other intestinal pathogens have a common source of infection and that they are often co-transmitted (31,32). However, for unknown reasons, T. whipplei could replicate in children with low-grade chronic infections without causing diarrhea. That T. whipplei\u2013infected patients were more likely to have co-infections than patients infected with other pathogens may also indicate that T. whipplei may decrease below molecular detection limits when diarrhea resolves. However, higher levels of IgM against T. whipplei in case-patients suggest infection with this bacterium. Moreover, an in vivo animal model of oral infection by T. whipplei has shown a pathogenic effect only in mice with previously inflamed colonic tissues (D. Raoult et al., unpub. data). Thus, inflamed colonic tissues may also explain the frequency of co-infections with common pathogens observed in persons with T. whipplei\u2013positive gastroenteritis.\n\nWe provide evidence that T. whipplei is commonly associated with gastroenteritis in children. We also suggest that other studies should be performed to evaluate the role of this bacterium and its prevalence in patients with gastroenteritis because it is present worldwide."}
