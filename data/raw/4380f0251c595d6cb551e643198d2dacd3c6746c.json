Coronaviruses usually cause respiratory, digestive and nervous system diseases in humans and animals (1) .\n\nIn the past 20 years, coronavirus has caused two global epidemics of severe respiratory infectious diseases, one of which was severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (2, 3) the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.20030916 doi: medRxiv preprint swab (5-9). However, in the actual diagnosis and treatment, the sensitivity of nucleic acid detection was not ideal enough. Only 30-50% of the confirmed COVID-19 cases had positive results, moreover, in some confirmed case, nucleic acid testing often took four or more tests to get a positive result. It is necessary to use a fast and convenient method to realize the rapid diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection.\n\nAfter the virus infects the organism, the immune system carries on the immune defense to the virus and produces the specific antibody. In the laboratory diagnosis of infectious diseases, the detection of specific antibodies to pathogens is a sensitive method for fast diagnosis. However, how the 2019-nCoV antibody produced and changed during COVID-19 progression is still unclear.\n\nIn this study, we used automated chemiluminescent immunoassay to detect serum IgM and IgG antibodies to 2019-nCoV, to understand the process of antibody production in disease progression, and to evaluate the value of antibody detection in the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19.\n\nThe study was conducted in accordance with the International Coordinating Council for Clinical Trials and the Helsinki Declaration, and was approved by the Hospital Ethics Review Committee (Ethics No 2020PS038K), and the patient's informed consent was exempted.\n\nAll rights reserved.

A receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was plotted to evaluate the diagnostic performance and correlations determined by Spearman's rank correlation.\n\nZ test was used to compare AUC between two groups. All tests were two sided and P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\nOf the 3 cases of confirmed case, 2 were male and 1 was female. The age ranged from 39 to 57 years. 2 patients had diabetes and hypertension respectively. 1 was a common case, 2 were severe cases. 1 case had history of Wuhan contact and the other 2 cases had no clear epidemiological history (Table 1 ).\n\nThe main laboratory findings of COVID-19 patients were normal or slightly low white blood cells and lymphocytes, elevated inflammatory indicators such as interleukin-6, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; and normal myocardial markers ( Table 2 ). the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.20030916 doi: medRxiv preprint showed that the level of anti-2019-nCoV IgG was continue higher than that of IgM, and the other two cases showed that the level of anti-2019-nCoV IgM increased more than that of IgG from 2 weeks of morbidity (Table 3 ).\n\nIn non-COVID-19, other disease, medical staff and health control groups, there were a few cases reactive for 2019-nCoV IgM and IgG, all the cases were single reactive for IgM or IgG. The sensitivities of IgM and IgG were 100%, as for specificities of IgM and IgG were all over 97% (Table 4 ).\n\nOf 225 non-COVID-19 cases, 2 cases were detectable for influenza A RNA and 2 cases were detectable for influenza B RNA, respectively, 4 cases were detectable for adenovirus DNA, 17 cases were detectable for mycoplasma pneumonia DNA (Table   4 ).\n\nWe also compared the anti-2019-nCoV antibodies values distributions in different groups. The anti-2019-nCoV IgM levels in non-COVID-19 was higher than that of healthy control group, the difference was statistically significant (Table 4 ; The area under the curve was 0.988 and 1.000, and the best cut-off value was 10.14 and 15.99, respectively ( Figure 3 ).\n\nWith China's growing surveillance network and laboratory capacity, the All rights reserved.

At present, the main diagnostic method is to detect 2019-nCoV nucleic acid by real-time quantitative fluorescent PCR.\n\nIn the early stage of this epidemic, due to the insufficient production of nucleic acid detection kits and the high requirement of technical norms for nucleic acid detection, the application of nucleic acid testing as a diagnostic standard was limited, When the body's immune system produces antibodies, the clinical signs and symptoms is obvious, the virus is likely to decline without being detected.

Therefore, it remains critical to apply a fast and convenient detection method to distinguish and trace suspicious case or contacts as early as possible in order to prevent super-transmission events.\n\nAntibodies are the products of humoral immune response after infection with viruses. As a new infectious disease, while the detection of nucleic acid cannot be used widely, specific antibodies to 2019-nCoV can be used to determine whether the patient has been recently infected with 2019-nCoV or not. It has been reported that serum samples from 5 patients were detected by self-made 2019-nCoV IgG and IgM ELISA kits, and the antigen could cover 92% of the 2019-nCoV NP amino acids (13) .\n\nGenerally speaking, the immune response of pathogenic microorganisms is usually stimulated by the rise of IgM after infection, IgG usually appears 1-2 weeks after IgM, and has been rising and maintaining high levels in the body for a long time.\n\nBecause COVID-19 is a new infectious disease and the immunological test reagent has just been developed, there is still no report on how IgM and IgG antibodies were produced and developed after 2019-nCoV infection.\n\nIn our study, we found that specific antibodies reactive to 2019-nCoV appeared from 7-12days after the onset of morbidity in all 3 patients. Unlike previous experience that IgG usually appears 1-2 weeks after IgM, the presence of anti-2019-nCoV IgM antibodies in COVID-19 cases was followed by the presence of All rights reserved.

Severe cases are prone to rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, high risk of admission to intensive care units, and even death.\n\nTherefore, how to closely observe the condition after morbidity and find severe cases as soon as possible is the key to reduce the mortality of critically ill patients.\n\nAccording to our findings, it seems that the time and speed of production of specific anti-2019-nCoV IgM antibodies correlate with disease severity. But because the number of cases is so small, more research is needed to confirm it.\n\nIn addition to COVID-19, the fever patient of non-COVID-19, other disease, All rights reserved.

Non-COVID-19 group included several other respiratory viruses such as influenza A, B and adenovirus infection cases, these cases were negative for anti-2019-nCoV specific antibody detection, indicating that the antibody detection has a good ability to resist interference and differential Considering that COVID-19 has broken out in many countries around the world, more than 80000 people have been diagnosed and the number is growing rapidly, the main problem at present is the need for highly sensitive tests to screen the suspected cases and to prevent missed diagnosis by nucleic acid tests, lower false positive rates for antibody testing are acceptable. In the meantime, for patients with morbidity for a week or more, simultaneous positive of anti-2019-nCoV IgM and IgG will be helpful to improve the specificity.\n\nCompared with nucleic acid test, which requires respiratory tract samples and complex testing procedures, the operation requirement of serum antibody detection in clinical laboratory is lower than that of nucleic acid detection, which can be detected quickly (30min) and in large quantities, and can be completed in common P2 Biosafety Laboratory.

It can be inferred that after the future epidemic situation has been controlled to a certain extent, as a convenient method, antibody detection is still necessary to make differential diagnosis of other respiratory pathogens infection.\n\nIt must be emphasized that independent results of specific antibodies testing should not be used as a diagnostic criteria, especially when the epidemiological history is unclear, and must be combined with the patient's morbidity time and clinical signs.It must be emphasized that independent results of specific antibodies testing should not be used as a diagnostic basis, especially when the epidemiological history is unclear, and must be combined with the patient's morbidity time and clinical signs.\n\nTo our knowledge, little has been reported about the specific antibody production process in the course of COVID-19 disease, and little has been reported about the different situation of antibodies in fever non-COVID-19 population, other diseases, special contact population such as medical staff and healthy population. This study provides data on the regularity of antibody production in the course of COVID-19, and provides some understanding of the basic data of specific antibodies in different populations. The results of this study help to provide evidence for rapid screening of suspected cases through the serological testing to curb the rapid progress of the epidemic globally.
