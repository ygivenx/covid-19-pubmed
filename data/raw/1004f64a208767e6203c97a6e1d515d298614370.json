{"title": "Deletion of the A35 Gene from Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara Increases Immunogenicity and Isotype Switching", "body": "Vaccinia virus (VACV) was used as the live virus vaccine during the smallpox eradication campaign, and its use ultimately led to the eradication of this fatal disease [1] . Despite being phenomenally successful, vaccination of the general public was discontinued due to the high rate of adverse events, including disseminated vaccinia, progressive vaccinia, eczema vaccinatum, and encephalitis [2] . It has been estimated that 25% of the current population should not be vaccinated due to immunosuppression, inflammatory skin conditions, or heart abnormalities [3] [4] [5] , and 1 out of every 450 people vaccinated will have a serious adverse reaction resulting in hospitalization [6] .\n\nSince the discontinuation of widespread poxvirus vaccination, there has been an increase in the incidence of human poxvirus infections throughout the world, including buffalopox in India [7] , Cantagalo vaccinia virus in South America [8, 9] and cowpox in Europe [10] . The most dangerous emerging poxvirus is monkeypox, which is a zoonotic poxvirus that causes a smallpox-like illness and has a 10% fatality rate in humans. There is growing concern as Monkeypox incidence has increased 20 fold since the 1980's [11] . Monkeypox is endemic to Africa, but in 2003 there was an outbreak in the United States that was associated with the importation of African rodents [12, 13] . This outbreak resulted in more than 80 cases, but because this was an attenuated strain, no deaths occurred [13, 14] . In addition to the threat of emerging poxvirus infections, there is also concern that the smallpox virus could be used as a biowarfare agent, resulting in widespread sickness and mortality in a now largely unvaccinated population. Thus, safer poxvirus vaccines are needed in the face of emerging disease and bioterrorism.\n\nA safer alternative to the traditional poxvirus vaccine is the use of attenuated, replicationdeficient strains, such as Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA). Attenuation of this virus occurred after >570 serial passages in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF), resulting in deletion of approximately 25 kb of the VACV genome [15] , including genes encoding immunomodulatory proteins [16] , and the inability to replicate in most mammalian cells [16] . MVA is being tested as a vaccine to protect against poxviruses [17] [18] [19] , and is also being used as a platform vaccine for other infectious diseases and cancer [20] [21] [22] . Poxviruses make good platform vaccines because they are stable and easy to produce, induce robust, durable cellular and humoral immune responses, and can accommodate the insertion of large pieces of foreign DNA [23] . MVA has been shown to be safe when administered to immunodeficient mice [24] , non-human primates [25] and humans [26, 27] . Recent vaccine trials have shown that MVA can be given safely to those infected with HIV [28] and those with atopic dermatitis [29] , two populations that cannot receive the traditional vaccine. Thus, this attenuated VACV shows promise as a safer alternative poxvirus vaccine and also as a platform vaccine.\n\nWhile MVA is clearly safer, there are concerns about its immunogenicity and efficacy [30] .\n\nIn studies comparing the immunogenicity of MVA to traditional poxvirus vaccines, MVA was unable to elicit the same levels of both antibody and IFN\u03b3-producing cells as traditional poxvirus vaccine strains, even when 10-100 times more virus was administered [17, 24, 31] . The immunogenicity of MVA may especially be a concern in populations with an already weakened immune system, such as cancer patients. Data available suggest that multiple doses of MVA may need to be administered in order to achieve the level of immunogenicity obtained with traditional replication-competent strains [31] . One strategy that can be used to enhance the immunogenicity of MVA is to identify and exclude genes that are immunosuppressive. The Copenhagen A35 gene (Western Reserve strain gene 158, MVA gene 146R) is one such gene.\n\nWe have previously shown that the poxvirus A35 gene is highly conserved in all sequenced mammalian-tropic poxviruses, including MVA [32] . It is an important virulence factor in the mouse model, increasing virulence of the Western Reserve (WR) virus by nearly 1000-fold, but A35 is not required for replication of the virus [32, 33] . In addition, we have shown that A35 in WR suppresses in vitro MHC class II-restricted antigen presentation [34] , and, following intranasal (i.n.) infection in mice, the protein mediates immunosuppression, significantly decreasing virus-specific antibody production, IFN\u03b3-secreting T cells, and CTL killing, resulting in the inability to control viral replication in target organs and thus contributing to morbidity and mortality of the host [33] . It was unknown whether A35 would have similar effects in MVA, or if some genes missing from MVA would be required for A35 functionality in MVA. Here, we characterize the A35 gene function in the background of the MVA genome and describe its immunosuppressive effects.\n\nVACV Western Reserve (WR) stocks were propagated using BS-C-1 cells in MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) as previously described [32] . MVA and MVA35\u0394 stocks were propagated using BHK-21. Viruses were purified using a sucrose gradient as previously described [Roper, 2006] . P815, BHK-21 cells (ATCC), and chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF) were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS.\n\nImmunostaining was performed as previously described [35] . BHK-21 cells were infected with a titration of either the MVA or MVA35\u0394 virus for 72 h. Cells were then incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of polyclonal VACV rabbit antiserum (BEI Resources NR629) for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, followed by incubation with a 1:1000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. 1 ml of the following substrate solution was then added to the wells to visualize virus-infected cells: 12 ul of 30% H 2 O 2 and 240 ul of dianisidine-saturated ethanol in 12 ml of PBS.\n\nThe DNA segment containing the A35 flanking regions and the E. coli xanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (gpt) gene was amplified from the existing vA35\u0394 mutant made from WR [32] using the primer pair TCGTGTTCATGATCTTGTTC and TTGCCTAGACCGGATACTA. The PCR product was then transfected with N- [1-(2,3dioleoyloxy) propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl-sulfate (DOTAP; Roche) into BHK-21 cells infected with the MVA strain. The viruses were selected in media containing mycophenolic acid (Sigma). Recombinant viruses (two independent mutant lines, designated MVA35\u0394-1 and MVA35\u0394-2) were plaque purified three times by using the immunostaining protocol described above and crude stocks were propagated in BHK-21 cells containing 10% FBS using previously described methods [32] . Crude virus lysates were prepped for PCR by incubation with an equal volume of 2x PCR buffer (0.9% IGEPAL, 0.9% Tween-20, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM KCl) and 0.3 mg/ml proteinase K for 30 m at 45\u00b0C, followed by heat-inactivation of the proteinase K for 10 m at 94\u00b0C [36] . The recombinant viruses were then PCR screened for the absence of A35 gene using the primers described above. All immunologic experiments were performed using both independently derived MVA35\u0394 mutant virus isolates to confirm that any difference seen compared to MVA was due to the deletion of the A35 gene.\n\nWestern blots were performed as previously described using polyclonal rabbit anti-A35 sera [32] .\n\nPrimary fibroblasts were isolated from a 10-day old chick embryo. Embryos were minced with a 10 cc syringe and then trypsinized two times for 5 minutes at 37\u00b0C. Cells were then washed, treated with ammonium chloride for 5 minutes on ice, washed again, and then counted in preparation for use in a one-step growth curve.\n\nA one-step growth curve was performed to measure viral replication in BHK-21 and CEF as previously described [32] . Virus foci were enumerated on BHK-21 cells using the immunostaining protocol described above.\n\nFemale BALB/c mice (n=5) were infected intramuscularly (i.m.) with 10 7 fu sucrosegradient purified MVA, MVA35\u0394-1, or MVA35\u0394-2 virus in 25 ul, or mock infected with PBS. Titers were confirmed on the day of infection with the virus dilution used to infect the animals. For challenge experiments, mice were vaccinated i.m. as described above and then infected intranasally (i.n.) 4 weeks later with 500 \u00d7 LD 50 of virulent WR [33] . Mice were weighed and monitored daily for signs of illness, and were humanely euthanized using isoflurane overdose if 20% weight loss occurred. For experiments assessing the immune response, five mice from each virus group were sacrificed and the spleens were collected in ice cold RPMI. Splenocytes were obtained using previously described methods [33, 37] . Blood samples (500 \u03bcl) were collected into microcentrifuge tubes using a cardiac stick, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 g for 30 min to separate out the antibody-containing sera from the red blood cells. Sera were stored at \u221220\u00b0 until use. All experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of East Carolina University.\n\nAntibody response was measured similar to our previous work [33] . Ninety six-well ELISA plates (Immulon H2B Thermo Electron) were coated overnight with 0.1 ul/well (100 ul) crude WR virus in ELISA coating buffer (1x 1M Tris-HCl, pH 9.5) at 4\u00b0C. Plates were blocked with 1% FBS/PBS at room temperature for 30 min. Plates were washed with ELISA wash buffer (1x PBS, 0.02% Tween 20, 0.1% NaN 3 ) and a titration of mouse sera ranging from 1:10-1:2560 (1:2 dilutions) from MVA-, MVA35\u0394-1-, or MVA35\u0394-2-vaccinated mice (n=5) (and PBS treated mice as control) was added. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 h and washed. Alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig, IgM, IgG, IgG 1 , or IgG 2a (Southern Biotech) was added and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Plates were washed 3 times, developed (BioRad Alkaline Phosphate Substrate Kit) and absorbance was read at 405 nm.\n\nNumbers of IFN\u03b3 secreting spleen cells were enumerated similar to our previous work [33] . Ninety six-well plates (Immulon H2B Thermo Electron) were coated overnight with 0.2 ul anti-mouse IFN-\u03b3 (1 mg/ml Pharmingen) at 4\u00b0C. Plates were washed with blocking buffer before adding a titration of murine splenocytes in RPMI 1640. Stimulation of splenocytes was achieved by either the addition of WR virus only (multiplicity of infection (MOI)=2) or with the use of 50,000 WR-infected (MOI=3) P815 stimulator cells, followed by incubation for 40 h at 37\u00b0C. Plates were then washed and incubated with 0.4 ul biotinylated rat antimouse IFN-\u03b3 (Pharmingen 0.5 mg/ml) for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. Plates were washed again and incubated with streptavidin-AP for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Plates were developed with agarose/BCIP/ AMP mixture, and spots were counted using a dissection microscope or color intensity was read at an absorbance of 492 nm.\n\nCell types present in spleens were analyzed by flow cytometry. Splenocytes (10 6 from MVA-, MVA35\u0394-1-, or MVA35\u0394-2-vaccinated mice (n=5) were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde on ice for 5 min, washed, and then incubated for 15 min with an anti-Fc block (BD Pharmingen) to block non-specific binding of antibodies to Fc receptors. The following anti-mouse allophycocyanin (APC)-, Pacific Blue (PacBl)-, phycoerythrin (PE)-, or phycoerythrin-cyanine 7 (PE-Cy7)-conjugated monoclonal antibodies were then added to the samples for 45 min on ice: CD8a/Lyt-2 (clone 53-6.7, Southern Biotech); CD11b (clone M1/70, eBioscience); CD11c (clone N418, eBioscience); CD45R/B220 (clone 30-F11; eBioscience); CD49b (Dx5, NK marker; BD Pharmingen); Ly-6G/Ly-6C (granulocyte marker, clone RB6-8C5; BD Pharmingen); F480 (macrophage marker; Caltag Labs); MHC II (I-A/I-E, clone M5/114.15.2; eBioscience). Samples were run on an LSR II flow cytometer and data were analyzed using the FACS Diva software.\n\nExperiments were repeated at least 2 times and representative data are shown. A two-tailed Student's t test was used to compare groups. p values < 0.05 were considered significant. Statistical analyses were performed using Excel (Microsoft Office 2007).\n\nWe previously showed that A35 is not required for replication in the wild type VACV WR strain, and that A35 inhibits in vitro MHC II-restricted antigen presentation [34] and suppresses both the T and B lymphocyte response in mice infected i.n. [33] . We next wished to determine if removal of A35 from an attenuated vaccine strain would affect replication or increase immunogenicity. To determine the role of A35 during infection with attenuated poxvirus strain MVA, a mutant virus missing the A35 gene was constructed. Similar to our previous A35 deletion mutant in the WR strain (designated A35\u0394) [32] , a PCR product containing the E. coli gpt gene with A35 flanking regions on either side was transfected into MVA-infected cells, and recombinant viruses were selected and purified. To confirm that A35 had been successfully knocked out of MVA, PCR analysis was performed using primers in the flanking regions. As shown in Fig 1a, PCR amplification of the parent MVA virus yielded a product of 1.5 kbp, and PCR analysis of two independently isolated MVA35\u0394 (MVA35\u0394-1 and \u22122) mutants resulted in an approximately 400 bp larger product when compared to the product from parental MVA. This is the expected size increase as a result of the insertion of the gpt-containing PCR fragment [32] . There was no wild type A35 detected in the mutants suggesting that the A35 gene had been successfully removed and indicating that the mutants were purified from MVA parental virus. To further confirm the absence of A35 from the recombinant viruses, a Western blot was performed to analyze reactivity with rabbit anti-A35 polyclonal sera [32] using lysates from MVA and MVA35\u0394 infected cells (Fig 1b) . A protein band of about 23 kDa (the approximate size of A35 [32] ) was recognized in the lysates from the WR and MVA-infected cells, and this protein band was absent in the WR-A35\u0394, MVA35\u0394-1, and MVA35\u0394-2 infected cells. Together, these data indicated that A35 was successfully knocked out of MVA in these two independently derived mutants.\n\nWe previously reported that an A35\u0394 mutant virus made from WR formed normal size plaques on the BS-C-1 African green monkey kidney cells and replicated normally in several cell lines and mouse tissues [32] [33] [34] , but it was possible that the loss of A35 in WR was being compensated for by another VACV protein. Since MVA is missing ~ 25 kb of the genome of WR, we assessed whether A35 might be required for MVA replication. The MVA35\u0394 virus formed normal, MVA-sized foci on BHK-21 cells (Fig 2a) , indicating that the loss of A35 had no apparent effect on normal viral replication and spread in these cells.\n\nTo compare the kinetics of replication of the MVA35\u0394 virus with the parental MVA virus, we performed a one-step growth curve (Fig 2b) . BHK-21 cells were infected (MOI=10) with either MVA35\u0394 or MVA for 2 h, and then inocula were removed. At various times post infection, cells and media were collected and the amount of virus in each was determined by titration on BHK-21 cells. For virus produced in the cells, there was <2-fold difference between the amount of virus produced by MVA and MVA35\u0394 at all time points tested. Similarly, for virus in the supernatants, MVA35\u0394 showed no decrease in virus production. A one step growth curve was also used to compare the growth of MVA to MVA35\u0394 in primary CEF, and at no time point tested was A35 required for viral replication (Fig 2b) . Similar results were seen using both MVA35\u0394-1 and MVA35\u0394-2 viruses. Together, these data indicate that A35 is not required for the normal replication of MVA in BHK-21 cells and primary CEF and further our conclusion that A35 is not required for VACV replication or spread from cell to cell.\n\nThe loss of A35 in virulent WR results in a 1000-fold decrease in virulence in the mouse model [33] . To determine whether the deletion of A35 had any effect on the virulence of MVA, mice were infected intramuscularly (i.m.) with 10 7 pfu purified MVA or one of the two MVA35\u0394 mutant viruses, a typical route of administration of MVA at a dose that has been shown to elicit a measurable immune response [17, 24, 31] , or mock-infected with PBS as a control. Mice were weighed and monitored daily for lesions or signs of illness. As shown in Fig 3, mice infected with either MVA or MVA35\u0394 gained weight similar to PBS control and had no signs of illness. Similar results were seen with infection no matter which MVA35\u0394 virus was used. In contrast, intranasal (i.n.) vaccination of mice with 10 3 pfu virulent WR results in significant weight loss and death [32, 33] . These data confirm that MVA is not virulent and its virulence is not altered by the loss of A35 gene from the genome.\n\nAn effective poxvirus vaccine should elicit both a humoral and a cellular immune response, as both arms of the immune system have been shown to mediate aspects of protection against poxvirus infections [31, 38, 39] . Our previous data with WR indicated that removal of the A35 gene results in an increase in both cellular and humoral immunity [33] , so we hypothesized that its removal from MVA would boost its immunogenicity. In WR it was possible that A35 protein interacted with another viral protein required for its function, and since MVA has several large deletions, this interacting protein may have been deleted, rendering A35 nonfunctional. To begin to understand the effects of A35 in MVA on the immune response, we compared the production of anti-VACV specific Ig in the sera of mice infected with either MVA or one of the two MVA35\u0394 viruses (Fig 4) . Infected mice had significantly greater amounts of anti-VACV antibody than PBS treated control mice, indicating that the response seen was VACV-specific. Mice infected with MVA35\u0394 had significantly greater amounts of total VACV-specific serum Ig than those infected with MVA on days 7 and 10 post infection (pi), indicating that A35 is immunosuppressive in MVA. We also analyzed the production of IgG and its subclasses on days 7 and 10 pi (Fig  5) , as antibody isotype switching is important for antibody functions. By day 10, mice infected with MVA35\u0394 virus produced significantly more VACV-specific IgG, IgG 1 , and IgG 2a than those infected with MVA. There was no significant difference in IgM production on these days. Infection with either mutant MVA35\u0394 virus yielded similar results, and representative data are shown. These data indicate that A35 in MVA decreases VACVspecific antibody production and inhibits isotype switching to IgG and subclasses IgG1 and IgG2a.\n\nIn order to measure the effect of A35 in MVA on the cellular immune response to infection, we used the ELISPOT assay to measure IFN\u03b3 production as a result of stimulation with VACV antigens presented in MHC [33, [40] [41] [42] . Mice were infected and on day six pi splenocytes were harvested and assayed for VACV specific IFN\u03b3 production. There was significantly more VACV-specific IFN\u03b3 production in the cells of mice infected with MVA35\u0394 compared to the mice infected with the parental MVA (Fig 6a) . On day 10 pi, there was a three-fold increase in the number of IFN\u03b3-producing spleen cells in the MVA35\u0394 group compared to the MVA group, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Similar results were seen with both MVA35\u0394 viruses and when splenocytes were stimulated with VACV-infected P815 cells. No IFN\u03b3 was produced by splenocytes from PBS control mice or in any of the groups without addition of virus or infected P815 cells, thus demonstrating the specificity of the response. Since CD8+ T cells produce most of the IFN\u03b3 following a VACV infection [39] , we also measured the percentage of CD8+ T cells in the splenocytes of infected mice on days 7 and 10 pi (Fig 6b) . We found that MVA infection significantly increased the percentage of CD8+ T cells in the spleens, but there was no difference between the MVA and MVA35\u0394-infected groups.\n\nWe had previously noted that VACV WR infection induces splenomegaly, presumably as a systemic specific immune response develops, and that spleen size increased most when mice were infected with a virus that is missing the immunosuppressive A35 gene [33] . To understand more about the mechanism of A35-mediated immunosuppression during infection with MVA, we performed flow cytometry to measure the percentage of cellular subsets within the spleens of MVA and MVA35\u0394-infected mice. On day 6 pi, there was little change in splenocyte populations (Fig 7) . There was a small but significant increase in the percentage of cells expressing CD11b and the Ly6 marker for granulocytes in the splenocytes of the MVA35\u0394-infected mice compared to MVA-infected mice (Fig 7a) . The CD11b difference was maintained on day 8 pi (data not shown). Also, on day 8 pi, there was a small but significant increase in the percent of DX5+ natural killer (NK) cells found in the MVA35\u0394 group compared to the MVA group (data not shown). Since our in vitro data indicated that A35 in WR specifically affects the APC [34] , we also looked at APC subsets within the spleen, including B cells (B220+CD11c\u2212), macrophages (CD11b+CD11c\u2212), and dendritic cells (CD11b-CD11c+), and found that on day 6 pi, there was a small but significant increase in the percent of macrophages in the spleens of the MVA35\u0394-infected mice compared to those infected with MVA (Fig 7b) . There was no significant difference between the groups in the percentage of total MHC class II expressing cells (Fig 7a) . Thus, infection with MVA results in a small but significant increase in cells expressing CD8 (Fig  6b) , and A35 modestly reduces an infection-induced increase in the percentage of granulocytes and CD11b+ expressing cells in spleens (Fig 7) .\n\nIt was next determined whether the MVA35\u0394 virus would be an efficacious vaccine and protect mice from a lethal VACV challenge. Removal of A35 from the WR strain of VACV did not reduce vaccine efficacy [33] . Many studies have been performed to determine the protective antigenic epitopes of VACV [43, 44] , but only the most recent of these studies has shown that epitopes derived from A35 can bind certain MHC class I alleles [45] . We therefore tested whether the removal of A35 from MVA would decrease vaccine efficacy due to the loss of predicted protective epitopes or perhaps increase efficacy due to enhanced immune responses. Mice were vaccinated i.m. with 10 7 MVA, MVA35\u0394, or PBS as control, and four weeks later were challenged i.n. with 500 \u00d7 LD 50 virulent WR virus (Fig 8) . PBS control mice quickly lost weight, and all died by 4 days post challenge. All MVA or MVA35\u0394 vaccinated mice survived the challenge with no significant weight loss and no signs of illness. Similar data were obtained for MVA35\u0394-1 and MVA35\u0394-2 virus isolates. Together, these data support the hypothesis that an MVA-based vaccine that excludes the A35 gene will be more immunogenic than and at least as efficacious as the wild-type MVA vaccine.\n\nWe have previously shown in the mouse model that the VACV A35 protein in WR virus is a virulence factor, increasing virulence by nearly 1000 fold and decreasing immunogenicity [32, 33] . Since A35 is highly conserved in mammalian-tropic poxviruses, it is probably effective in many host mammals. In this manuscript, we provide a characterization of A35 in the attenuated VACV vaccine strain, MVA, and show that A35 inhibited adaptive immunity, including the generation of IFN\u03b3 secreting T cells and antibody production. These results are consistent to what we have observed for the A35 gene in the WR virus [33] . A35 was not required for replication in MVA in either BHK-21 cells or in CEF, the cells in which MVA was derived. This is fortuitous for vaccine production of MVA35\u0394 mutant viruses. During its >570 passages in CEFs, MVA lost many of the immunosuppressive genes found in VACV, including the secreted receptor homologs for IFN\u03b3, IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b2, and TNF [16] . MVA did retain a few immunoevasion genes, including the IL-1\u03b2 receptor homolog [16] and A35 [32] . Since genes are lost through random mutation in the absence of selection, the retention of certain genes is probably simply random.\n\nSince MVA is avirulent, it is being tested as an alternative safer poxvirus vaccine and is also being used as a platform vaccine for delivering various other antigens, including those for cancer and HIV [20] [21] [22] . Unfortunately, MVA fails to elicit the same high levels of B and T cell responses as the traditional replicating poxvirus vaccines [17, 24, 31] . We therefore removed A35 from MVA in hopes of increasing its immunogenicity. The results of this experiment could not be predicted however, because MVA might have lost some required viral A35-cofactor gene through its passages and large genome deletions. We show here that A35 does indeed function to suppress the specific immune response in the background of the MVA genome. Removal of A35 resulted in increased antibody production, isotype switching to IgG and its subclasses IgG1 and IgG2a, and IFN\u03b3 secreting T cells, suggesting that removal of A35 from poxvirus-based vaccines will enhance their immunogenicity. In WR, the improved immune response in the absence of A35 correlated with improved control of virus replication in target organs [33] , but since MVA does not replicate in mammalian tissues, we could not perform those experiments here. It was possible that removal of the A35 gene would diminish poxvirus vaccine efficacy if an anti-A35 immune response were protective. However, we showed that vaccination with MVA35\u0394 virus protects mice as well as wild type MVA from a virulent challenge.\n\nRemoval of A35 significantly increased virus-specific Ig, IgG, IgG 1 , and IgG 2a . The latter two IgG subclasses were specifically chosen since they can be used as a measure of the Th2 and Th1 immune responses, respectively [46] . A predominantly Th1 response is associated with smaller lesion size and decreased viral replication in mice and humans [47, 48] . Following VACV infection, persons with atopic dermatitis produce higher levels of cytokines and antibodies associated with the less protective Th2 response [49] , resulting in uncontrolled replication of virus in the skin. In addition, a recombinant VACV expressing IL-4 (a Th2 cytokine) was more virulent than wild-type virus [50] . However, we found no evidence that A35 was skewing the immune response towards the less protective Th2 response. Instead, A35 inhibited class switching to both IgG 1 and IgG 2a isotypes. These data are consistent with our in vitro data which indicate that A35 specifically inhibits the MHC class II:CD4 T cell interaction [34] , required for induction of isotype switching [39] . It has been reported that splenic DCs from VACV-infected mice were deficient in presenting a model antigen to specific CD4+ T cells [51] . Our data showed that the removal of the A35 gene in WR caused elevated antibody levels at least up to one month after vaccination [33] , suggesting that A35 deletion mutant viruses may give effective protection for longer time periods. Together these data support the removal of the A35 gene from poxvirus vaccine strains used for poxvirus vaccination or other infectious diseases and cancer.
