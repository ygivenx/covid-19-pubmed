{"title": "Title page Association between syphilis prevalence and age: an analysis of surveillance data among blood donors in southern China, 2014-2017", "body": "This study described the syphilis prevalence among nearly 400 000 blood donors, including syphilis infection, active infection, and distribution of serological titres.\n\nUsing trend analysis after stratification of gender and year of donation to examine the association between syphilis prevalence and age, the results confirmed the increasing trend of prevalence with age.\n\nLack of information on syphilis prevalence between first-time donors and repeat donors is a limitation to this study. The global population is ageing as a combined result of the demographic transition from high to low levels of fertility and mortality. 1 Population ageing increases the total global disease burden, with approximately 23% attributable to disorders in people aged \u226560 years. 2 Chronic non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular disease, malignant neoplasms, and chronic respiratory diseases, are the leading contributors to disease burden in older people. 2 However, infectious diseases also considerably affect older people, as an increasing incidence of infectious diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and syphilis, was shown from recent surveillance data. [3] [4] [5] This large disease burden in older people calls for improvements in the healthcare system and more investments and programs focusing on healthy ageing. 2 Syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum, is a chronic infection with diverse clinical manifestations occurring in distinct stages, and may lead to blindness, dementia, delirium, death, etc., if not treated immediately or adequately. 6 Syphilis can also aid the passage for HIV to invade, reduce the CD4 T-cell levels, and increase the viral load, thereby aggravating the harm of HIV. 7 Even though syphilis can be effectively treated by penicillin, about 36.4 million new cases occur annually. 8 In China, the syphilis epidemic has rapidly increased, with 16.3% increase per year during the first decade after the SARS outbreak. 9 The reported incidence was slightly higher among females than males (ratio, 1.00 to 0.92), but it varied significantly with age. 5 The younger people (20-39 years) reported the highest syphilis incidence and accounted for the largest proportion of newly reported cases; however, the older age groups (\u226545 years) had the fastest growth in incidence, and males aged \u226560 years displayed a peak incidence of latent syphilis in the last decade. 5 With the accelerated ageing of the global population, the increasing syphilis epidemic among older adults is alarming.\n\nShenzhen, located in southern China and next to Hong Kong, is a large city with a population of >10 million. 10 It was the first city in China to make donated blood meet counsellors, methadone maintenance treatment users, female sex workers, men who have sex with men(MSM), and women of childbearing age], as well as case management, including diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up, for syphilis-infected adults. 12 The reported syphilis incidence remained relatively stable since 2008.\n\nHowever, consistent with the aforementioned characteristics of varied age groups, a rapid growth of syphilis incidence was observed among older adults in Shenzhen. 13 Studies usually considered blood donors as the representative of general population and used the prevalence data of blood donors for real-time surveillance and identification of high-risk groups. 14 Whether the syphilis seroprevalence among blood donors agrees with reported incidence characteristics remains to be studied.\n\nTherefore, this study aimed to examine differences in syphilis prevalence among blood donors and describe the distribution of serological titres among syphilis-infected donors with respect to age groups, to confirm the syphilis epidemic characteristics in southern China and support the design of effective interventions for older adults.\n\nBlood donors were recruited by the Shenzhen Blood Center between 2014 and 2017.\n\nMore than 10 blood mobiles, with the Shenzhen Blood Center logo and the words 'non-remunerated blood donation', were dispatched around the city to increase the accessibility of blood donation. Volunteers could go to the mobiles or to the blood centre directly.\n\nBefore donation, all potential donors needed to complete a detailed health history questionnaire, sign a donation registration form, undergo weight, blood pressure and heart rate measurement, and have a rapid test for blood type, hemoglobin, hepatitis B surface antigen and alanine transaminase. People who conformed to the Whole \n\nBased on serological testing results, syphilis infection was divided into two categories:\n\nhistorical infection and active infection. Historical infection was defined as TPPA positive but TRUST negative, and active infection as both TPPA and TRUST positive. 15 The overall syphilis infection was defined as TPPA positive, including both historical and active infection. Moreover, high-titre was defined as active infection patients with a quantitative titre of \u2265 1\u22368. infection among all blood donors in different age groups. There were four age groups, <25 years, 25-34 years, 35-44 years, and \u226545 years, fully considering the age coverage of blood donors and age classification in previous studies. 16 , 17 We calculated the crude prevalence and its 95% confidence interval (CI). The chi-squared (\u03c7 2 ) test for trend was used to assess the prevalence difference among age groups. Line graphs were used to describe the change in prevalence for both syphilis infection and active infection among the age groups after stratification of gender and year of donation. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% CIs were calculated when comparing the risk of syphilis infection and active infection between the \u2265 45 years age group and other age groups. Furthermore, we described the distribution of TRUST titres among age groups and compared the difference using the \u03c7 2 test. Data were analysed using SPSS 17.0 for Windows; p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant in the \u03c7 2 test.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2017, a total of 394 792 donors were recruited by the Shenzhen Blood Center for non-remunerated blood donation. Among them, 67.4% were male and 85.0% were <45 years. The proportion of male donors increased significantly by age (\u03c7 2 trend = 8301.1, p trend < 0.001), and the number of donations in each age group increased over the studied years (\u03c7 2 trend = 932.3, p trend < 0.001) ( Table 1) . TRUST titre of \u22651\u22368. The distribution of TRUST titres was varied among the age groups (Figure 3) . Patients aged \u226545 years comprised a large proportion of low titres at 1\u22361 and 1\u22362, and the proportion of high titres was only 16 .3%, which was much smaller than that among patients aged <25 years (51.3%) and 25-34 years (34.1%) ( Table 3) . \n\nThis study identified that the overall prevalence of syphilis infection among nearly 400 000 blood donors in 2014-2017 was 370.1 per 100 000, which was higher than that reported in the United States (54.6 per 100 000) and Brazil (135.5 per 100 000), 14, 18 but lower than that reported in Ethiopia (732.4 per 100 000), Cameroon (3976.3 per 100 000), and India (1623.7 per 100 000). [19] [20] [21] The prevalence was similar to that in many cities in mainland China, such as Xi'an (359.6 per 100 000), Urumqi (359.3 per 100 000), and Kunming (381.2 per 100 000). 16, 22 However, unlike some studies using only one method (i.e., ELISA) to confirm the syphilis infection status and report the prevalence, 16, 20, 22, 23 29 Referral, treatment, and follow-up services would be provided to those diagnosed with syphilis. In Shenzhen, more than half of VCT sites are set in community health service centres, where a separate room is arranged for counselling and testing service. However, due to the low awareness of self-testing, older adults rarely positively seek the services.\n\nMeanwhile, most health staff are unwilling to provide the service actively because of limited experience, lack of time, discomfort in discussing sexual behaviours and STDs with older adults, stigma, ageism, etc. 27 Hence, enhanced training of healthcare providers and education of older adults are necessary.\n\nAs mentioned, the prevalence of both syphilis infection and active infection were higher among females than males, consistent with the results of some previous studies. 22, 23 The physiology and anatomy of the genital organs are much different between both sexes. Females are more likely to contract STDs in receptive vaginal sex behaviours. 30 The male-to-female transmission rate is higher than the female-to-male rate in certain STDs, such as HIV. 30, 31 Besides, a proportion of females have premarital or extramarital sexual partners. A previous study has found that syphilis prevalence among husbands of 2261 syphilis-infected pregnant women was < 30%. 32 Additionally, being serofast (or remaining positive in a non-treponemal test and having a titre with less than a fourfold decline in \u22651 year after recommended therapy) is common among syphilis patients. 33 The serofast rate is higher among females than males (42.8% vs 28.6%), 34 leading to more females staying in the state of active infection. The exact mechanism of this difference is unclear, but it may be partly associated with the varied immune system between both sexes. 34 \n\nThis study provides an in-depth analysis of the associations between syphilis prevalence and age. Older adults showed a high prevalence of both syphilis infection and active infection but a small proportion of high titres, which point towards the compelling need to heighten awareness among healthcare providers and deliver more-targeted prevention interventions for older adults to promote early testing. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 \n\nThe findings confirm the high prevalence of syphilis among older adults, and suggest the need to increase awareness among healthcare providers and deliver more targeted prevention interventions for older adults to promote early testing. \uf084 The testing process in this study, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as a screening test and then using Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TPPA) and toluidine red unheated serum test (TRUST) to confirm the serostatus, increased the accuracy of syphilis seroprevalence.\n\n\uf084 Lack of information on syphilis prevalence between first-time donors and repeat donors was a limitation to this study. \n\nThe global population is ageing as a combined result of the demographic transition from high to low levels of fertility and mortality. 1 Population ageing increases the total global disease burden, with approximately 23% attributable to disorders in people aged \u226560\n\nyears. 2 Chronic non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular disease, malignant neoplasms, and chronic respiratory diseases, are the leading contributors to disease burden in older people. 2 However, infectious diseases also considerably affect older people, as an increasing incidence of infectious diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and syphilis, was shown from recent surveillance data.

Shenzhen, a special economic zone located in southern China and with a population of >10 million, is one of the cities that most affected by syphilis. The reported incidence of syphilis was over 60 per 100 000 in last 10 years, which was much higher than the national incidence. 5,10 Consistent with the aforementioned characteristics of varied age groups, a rapid increase in syphilis incidence was observed among older adults in Shenzhen. 11 Studies usually considered blood donors as a representative of the general population and used the prevalence data of blood donors for real-time surveillance and identification of high-risk groups. 12 Whether the syphilis seroprevalence among blood donors agrees with reported incidence characteristics remains to be studied.

Center within 2 days after the samples were received.\n\nBased on serological testing results, syphilis infection was divided into two categories:\n\nhistorical infection and active infection. Historical infection was defined as TPPA positive but TRUST negative and active infection as both TPPA and TRUST positive. 14 Overall syphilis infection was defined as TPPA positive, including both historical and active infection. Moreover, high-titre was defined as a quantitative titre of \u2265 1\u22368 in patients with active infection.\n\nPrimary outcomes of interest were the prevalence of syphilis infection and active infection among all blood donors in different age groups. There were four age groups, <25 years, 25-34 years, 35-44 years, and \u226545 years, fully considering the age coverage of blood donors and age classification in previous studies. 15, 16 We calculated the crude prevalence and its 95% confidence interval (CI).

Data were analysed using SPSS 17.0 for Windows; p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant in the \u03c7 2 test.\n\nPatients and the public were not involved in developing the hypothesis or the research questions, nor were they involved in developing plans for the design or implementation \n\nFrom 2014 to 2017, a total of 394 792 donors were recruited by the Shenzhen Blood\n\nCenter for non-remunerated blood donation. Among them, 67.4% were male and 85.0%\n\nwere aged <45 years. The distribution of age was varied between genders (\u03c7 2 = 11249.0, p < 0.001) and among years of donation (\u03c7 2 = 1182.0, p < 0.001). People aged 25-34 years accounted for the largest proportion of donors ( Table 1) . \n\nAfter ELISA testing, 2597 samples tested positive and were sent to the SZCCC for further examination. Among them, 733 (28.2%) were both TPPA and TRUST positive, 728 (28.0%)\n\nwere only TPPA positive, and 1136 (43.7%) were false positive (Figure 1) \n\nAmong 733 donors with active infection, a TRUST titre of 1\u22361 accounted for the largest proportion (41.7%), followed by a titre of 1\u22362 (24.1%). About 27.0% had a TRUST titre of \u22651\u22368. The distribution of TRUST titres was varied among the age groups (Figure 3) .\n\nPatients aged \u226545 years comprised a large proportion of low titres at 1\u22361 and 1\u22362, and the proportion of high titres was only 16.3%, which was much smaller than that among patients aged <25 years (51.3%) and 25-34 years (34.1%). The proportion of high-titre Evidence suggests that the most significant factor affecting testing patterns in older adults is providing the screening test actively. 29 Since the initiation of China's national syphilis control plan, syphilis screening has been widely integrated into HIV voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) services. More than 95% of people who received HIV testing services have undergone free syphilis testing. 30 Referral, treatment, and follow-up services would be provided to those diagnosed with syphilis. In Shenzhen, more than half of VCT sites are set in community health service centres, where a separate room is arranged for counselling and testing service. However, due to the low awareness of self-testing, older adults rarely positively seek the services. Meanwhile, most health staff are unwilling to provide the service actively because of limited experience, lack of time, discomfort in discussing sexual behaviours and STDs with older adults, stigma, ageism, etc. 28 Hence, enhanced training of healthcare providers and education of older adults are necessary.\n\nConsistent with the results of some previous studies, the prevalence of both syphilis infection and active infection were higher among females than males. 21, 22 It may stem partly from the different physiology and anatomy of the genital organs between both sexes, leading to females being more likely to contract STDs in receptive vaginal sex behaviours. 31 Some studies have proved that the male-to-female transmission rate is higher than the female-to-male rate in certain STDs, such as HIV. 31 has found that the syphilis prevalence among husbands of 2261 syphilis-infected pregnant women was < 30%. 33 Additionally, being serofast [defined as remaining positive in a non-treponemal test and keeping the titre at a certain level (mostly 1:8 or below) after recommended therapy and follow-up at least 1 year for primary syphilis, 2 years for secondary syphilis and 3 years for late syphilis] is common among syphilis patients. 34 The serofast rate is higher among females than males (42.8% vs. 28.6%), 35\n\nleading to more females staying in the state of active infection. The exact mechanism underlying this difference is unclear, but it may be partly associated with the varied immune system between both sexes. 35 Furthermore, MSM are considered to be a major high-risk subgroup for syphilis infection and are permanently deferred from blood donation in China. 36 In this study, males were excluded if they reported they had ever engaged in homosexual behaviour in the health history questionnaire, which may be one of the reasons for the low syphilis prevalence among males.\n\nOur study has several limitations. First, limited financial and human resources restricted us in using a population-based design, which is considered as the gold standard in evaluating disease epidemics. 12 The choice of blood donors as population samples may result in potential bias, such as selection bias for age coverage and self-identified health conditions. Second, this study did not distinguish the syphilis seroprevalence between first-time donors and repeat donors, which may lead to underestimation of syphilis disease burden. In previous studies, the syphilis seroprevalence among first-time donors was significantly higher than that among repeat donors. 12 \n\nThis study provides an in-depth analysis of the association between syphilis \n\nObjective: This study investigated the association between syphilis seroprevalence and age among blood donors, and described the distribution of serological titres among syphilis-infected donors, aiming to confirm the syphilis epidemic characteristics and to promote effective interventions for older adults. \n\nThe findings confirm the high prevalence of syphilis among older adults, and suggest the need to increase awareness among healthcare providers and deliver more targeted prevention interventions for older adults to promote early testing. \n\n\uf084 This study described the syphilis seroprevalence among nearly 400 000 blood donors, including syphilis seropositivity, active infection, and distribution of serological titres.\n\n\uf084 The testing process in this study, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as a screening test and then using Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TPPA) and toluidine red unheated serum test (TRUST) to confirm the serostatus, increased the accuracy of syphilis seroprevalence.\n\n\uf084 Lack of information on syphilis seroprevalence between first-time donors and repeat donors was a limitation to this study. \n\nThe global population is ageing as a combined result of the demographic transition from high to low levels of fertility and mortality. 1 Population ageing increases the total global disease burden, with approximately 23% attributable to disorders in people aged \u226560 years. 2 Chronic non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular disease, malignant neoplasms, and chronic respiratory diseases, are the leading contributors to disease burden in older people. 2 However, infectious diseases also considerably affect older people, as an increasing incidence of infectious diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and syphilis, was shown from recent surveillance data.

The reported incidence of syphilis was over 60 per 100 000 in last 10 years, which was much higher than the national incidence. 5,10 Consistent with the aforementioned characteristics of varied age groups, a rapid increase in syphilis incidence among older adults was observed in Shenzhen. 11 Studies usually considered blood donors as a representative of the general population and used the prevalence data of blood donors for real-time surveillance and identification of high-risk groups. 12 Whether the syphilis seroprevalence among blood donors agrees with reported incidence characteristics remains to be studied. Shenzhen launched a comprehensive program, the Shenzhen Program for Syphilis Prevention and Control (SPSPC), in November 2013 to enhance syphilis screening among blood donors and five other subgroups (HIV voluntary counsellors, methadone maintenance treatment users, female sex workers, men who have sex with men, and women of childbearing age), as well as case management, including diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up, for syphilis-infected adults. 13 Based on the data from the SPSPC, this study aimed to examine differences in syphilis seroprevalence among blood donors and describe the distribution of serological titres among syphilis-infected donors with respect to age groups, to confirm the syphilis epidemic characteristics in southern China and support the design of effective interventions for older adults. Before donation, all potential donors needed to complete a health history questionnaire, sign a donation registration form, and undergo rapid testing and a brief physical examination. The health history questionnaire contained a total of 27 medical conditions that would permanently or temporarily prevent the donors from \n\nBased on serological test results, syphilis seropositivity was divided into historical infection and active infection, which was consistent with the classification from 12 Historical infection was defined as TPPA positive but TRUST negative and active infection as both TPPA and TRUST positive. 14 Syphilis seropositivity was defined as TPPA positive, including both TRUST negative and TRUST positive. Moreover, high-titre was defined as a quantitative titre of \u2265 1\u22368 in patients with active infection. For the purpose of this study, syphilis seropositivity which represented the overall infection status among the target population, and active infection and high-titre status which were correlated with disease activity, were analysed.\n\nPrimary outcomes of interest were the prevalence of syphilis seropositivity and active infection among all blood donors in different age groups. There were four age groups, <25 years, 25-34 years, 35-44 years, and \u226545 years, fully considering the age coverage of blood donors and age classification in previous studies. 15, 16 We calculated the crude prevalence and its 95% confidence interval (CI). The chi-squared (\u03c7 2 ) test for trend was used to assess the difference in prevalence among age groups.\n\nOdds ratios (ORs) and their 95% CIs were calculated when comparing the risk of syphilis seropositivity and active infection between the \u2265 45 years age group and other age groups. Line graphs were used to describe the changes in prevalence for both syphilis seropositivity and active infection among the age groups after stratification by gender and year of donation. Furthermore, we described the distribution of TRUST titres among the age groups and compared the difference using the \u03c7 2 test for trend. Data were analysed using SPSS 17.0 for Windows (IBM Corp., Armonk, USA); p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant in the \u03c7 2 test.\n\nPatients and the public were not involved in developing the hypothesis or research questions, nor were they involved in developing plans for the design or implementation of this study. The staff of the Shenzhen Blood Center were responsible for telling syphilis-positive participants about the test results and providing referral services related to syphilis treatment and management by phone. \n\nFrom 2014 to 2017, a total of 394 792 donors were recruited by the Shenzhen Blood Center for non-remunerated blood donation. Among them, 67.4% were male and 85.0% were aged <45 years. The distribution of age was varied between genders (\u03c7 2 = 11249.0, p < 0.001) and among years of donation (\u03c7 2 = 1182.0, p < 0.001). People aged 25-34 years accounted for the largest proportion of donors ( Table 1) . \n\nAfter ELISA testing, 2597 samples tested positive and were sent to the SZCCC for further examination. Among them, 733 (28.2%) were both TPPA and TRUST positive, 728 (28.0%) were only TPPA positive, and 1136 (43.7%) were false positive (Figure 1) . CI, 1.5-2.2) higher than that among people aged 25-34 years, respectively. Trend analysis showed that the prevalence of syphilis seropositivity (\u03c7 2 trend = 311.9, p trend < 0.001) and active infection (\u03c7 2 trend = 72.1, p trend < 0.001) increased significantly with age ( Table 2) . After stratification by gender and year of donation, the increasing trend of prevalence with age remained (p trend < 0.05), except for the prevalence of active infection among males (\u03c7 2 trend = 0.923, p trend = 0.337) and females (\u03c7 2 trend = 0.224, p trend = 0.636) in 2014 (Figure 2 ). \n\nAmong 733 donors with active infection, a TRUST titre of 1\u22361 accounted for the largest proportion (41.7%), followed by a titre of 1\u22362 (24.1%). About 27.0% had a TRUST titre of \u22651\u22368. The distribution of TRUST titres was varied among the age groups (Figure 3) . Patients aged \u226545 years comprised a large proportion of low titres at 1\u22361 and 1\u22362, and the proportion of high titres was only 16.3%, which was much smaller than that among patients aged <25 years (51.3%) and 25-34 years (34.1%).\n\nThe proportion of high-titre declined significantly with age (\u03c7 2 trend = 53.6, p trend < 0.001) ( Table 3) . Evidence suggests that the most significant factor affecting testing patterns in older adults is the active provision of the screening test. 29 Since the initiation of China's 30 Referral, treatment, and follow-up services would be provided to those diagnosed with syphilis. In Shenzhen, more than half of VCT sites are set in community health service centres, where a separate room is arranged for counselling and testing service.\n\nHowever, due to the low awareness of self-testing, older adults rarely positively seek the services. Meanwhile, most health staff are unwilling to provide the service actively because of limited experience, lack of time, discomfort in discussing sexual behaviours and STDs with older adults, stigma, ageism, etc. 28 Hence, enhanced training of healthcare providers and education of older adults are necessary.\n\nConsistent with the results of some previous studies, the prevalence of both syphilis seropositivity and active infection were higher among females than males. 21, 22 It may stem partly from the different physiology and anatomy of the genital organs between both sexes, leading to females being more likely to contract STDs in receptive vaginal sex behaviours. 31 Some studies have proved that the male-to-female transmission rate is higher than the female-to-male rate in certain STDs, such as HIV. 31, 32 Besides, a proportion of females have multiple sex partners during their lifetime. A previous study has found that the syphilis prevalence among husbands of 2261 syphilis-infected pregnant women was < 30%. 33 Premarital or extramarital sexual partners may greatly increase the risk of syphilis infection among females. Additionally, serological response differs between males and females. 34 Females are more likely to be serofast [defined as remaining positive in a non-treponemal test and keeping the titre at a certain level (mostly 1:8 or below) after recommended therapy and follow-up 1 to 3 years according to syphilis stage] when comparing with males, 35 leading to more females staying in the state of active infection. The exact mechanism underlying this difference is unclear, but it may be partly associated with the varied immune system between both sexes. 34 Furthermore, men who have sex with men are considered a major high-risk subgroup for syphilis infection and are permanently deferred from blood donation in\n\nChina. 36 In this study, males were excluded if they reported they had ever engaged in homosexual behaviour in the health history questionnaire, which may be one of the reasons for the low syphilis prevalence among males.\n\nOur study has several limitations. First, limited financial and human resources restricted us in using a population-based design, which is considered as the gold standard in evaluating disease epidemics. 12 The choice of blood donors as population samples may result in potential bias, such as selection bias for age coverage and self-identified health conditions. Second, the syphilis seroprevalence among first-time donors was significantly higher than that among repeat donors. 12 \n\nThis study provides an in-depth analysis of the association between syphilis seroprevalence and age. Older adults showed a high prevalence of both syphilis seropositivity and active infection but a small proportion of high titres, which point towards the compelling need to heighten awareness among healthcare providers and deliver more targeted prevention interventions for older adults to promote early testing.\n\nAcknowledgements The authors would like to thank Qiong Yu and Xi Chen from the Shenzhen Blood Center for their support in data collection, and Qianqiu Wang and Yueping Yin from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences in revising the manuscript.

[3] [4] [5] This large disease burden among older people calls for improvements in the healthcare system and more investments and programs focusing on healthy ageing. 2 Syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum, is a chronic infection with diverse clinical manifestations occurring in distinct stages, and may lead to blindness, dementia, delirium, death, etc., if not treated immediately or adequately. 6 Syphilis can also aid the passage for HIV to invade, reduce the CD4 T-cell levels, and increase the viral load, thereby aggravating the harm caused by HIV. 7 Even though syphilis can be effectively treated with penicillin, about 36.4 million new cases occur annually. 8 In China, the syphilis epidemic has rapidly increased, with a 16.3% increase per year during the first decade after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. 9 The reported incidence was slightly higher among females than males (ratio, 1.00 to 0.92), but it varied significantly with age. 5 Younger people (aged 20-39 years) reported the highest syphilis incidence and accounted for the largest proportion of newly reported cases; however, the older age groups (aged \u226545 years) had the fastest growth in incidence, and males aged \u226560 years displayed a peak incidence of latent syphilis in the last decade. 5 With the accelerated ageing of the global population, the increasing syphilis epidemic among older adults is alarming.\n\nShenzhen, a special economic zone located in southern China and with a population of >10 million, is one of the cities that most affected by syphilis. The reported incidence of syphilis was over 60 per 100 000 in last 10 years, which was much higher than the national incidence. 5, 10 Consistent with the aforementioned characteristics of varied age groups, a rapid increase in syphilis incidence among older adults was observed in Shenzhen. 11 Studies usually considered blood donors as a representative of the general population and used the prevalence data of blood donors for real-time surveillance and identification of high-risk groups. 12 Whether the syphilis seroprevalence among blood donors agrees with reported incidence characteristics remains to be studied. Shenzhen launched a comprehensive program, the Shenzhen Program for Syphilis Prevention and Control (SPSPC), in November 2013 to enhance syphilis screening among blood donors and five other subgroups (HIV voluntary counsellors, methadone maintenance treatment users, female sex workers, men who have sex with men, and women of childbearing age), as well as case management, including diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up, for syphilis-infected adults. 13 Based on the data from the SPSPC, this study aimed to examine differences in syphilis seroprevalence among blood donors and describe the distribution of serological titres among syphilis-infected donors with respect to age groups, to confirm the syphilis epidemic characteristics in southern China and support the design of effective interventions for older adults. Before donation, all potential donors needed to sign a donation registration form, complete a health history questionnaire, and undergo rapid testing and a brief physical examination. A concise introduction of blood use, donation procedure, laboratory testing, and legal and regulatory requirements was shown at the front of 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 \n\nBased on serological test results, syphilis seropositivity was divided into historical infection and active infection, which was consistent with the classification from previous studies. 12 Historical infection was defined as TPPA positive but TRUST negative and active infection as both TPPA and TRUST positive. 14 Syphilis seropositivity was defined as TPPA positive, including both TRUST negative and TRUST positive. Moreover, high-titre was defined as a quantitative titre of \u2265 1\u22368 in patients with active infection. For the purpose of this study, syphilis seropositivity which represented the overall infection status among the target population, and active infection and high-titre status which were correlated with disease activity, were analysed.\n\nData of donors' number among different subgroups (age, gender and year of donation) and syphilis testing results were sourced from the Shenzhen Blood Center and the SZCCC, respectively. Primary outcomes of interest were the prevalence of syphilis seropositivity and active infection among all blood donors in different age groups. There were four age groups, <25 years, 25-34 years, 35-44 years, and \u226545 years, fully considering the age coverage of blood donors and age classification in previous studies. 15, 16 We calculated the crude prevalence and its 95% confidence interval (CI). The chi-squared (\u03c7 2 ) test for trend was used to assess the difference in prevalence among age groups. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% CIs were calculated when comparing the risk of syphilis seropositivity and active infection between the \u2265 45 years age group and other age groups. Line graphs were used to describe the changes in prevalence for both syphilis seropositivity and active infection among the age groups after stratification by gender and year of donation. Furthermore, we described the distribution of TRUST titres among the age groups and compared the difference using the \u03c7 2 test for trend. Data were analysed using SPSS 17.0 for Windows (IBM Corp., Armonk, USA); p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant in the \u03c7 2 test. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n l y\n\nPatients and the public were not involved in developing the hypothesis or research questions, nor were they involved in developing plans for the design or implementation of this study. The staff of the Shenzhen Blood Center were responsible for telling syphilis-positive participants about the test results and providing referral services related to syphilis treatment and management by phone.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2017, a total of 394 792 donors were recruited by the Shenzhen Blood Center for non-remunerated blood donation. Among them, 67.4% were male and 85.0% were aged <45 years. The distribution of age was varied between genders (\u03c7 2 = 11249.0, p < 0.001) and among years of donation (\u03c7 2 = 1182.0, p < 0.001). People aged 25-34 years accounted for the largest proportion of donors ( Table 1) . \n\nAfter ELISA testing, 2597 samples tested positive and were sent to the SZCCC for further examination. Among them, 733 (28.2%) were both TPPA and TRUST positive, 728 (28.0%) were only TPPA positive, and 1136 (43.7%) were false positive (Figure 1) . 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 \n\nAmong 733 donors with active infection, a TRUST titre of 1\u22361 accounted for the largest proportion (41.7%), followed by a titre of 1\u22362 (24.1%). About 27.0% had a TRUST titre of \u22651\u22368. The distribution of TRUST titres was varied among the age groups (Figure 3) . Patients aged \u226545 years comprised a large proportion of low titres at 1\u22361 and 1\u22362, and the proportion of high titres was only 16.3%, which was much 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 The proportion of high-titre declined significantly with age (\u03c7 2 trend = 53.6, p trend < 0.001) ( Table 3) . 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Evidence suggests that the most significant factor affecting testing patterns in older adults is the active provision of the screening test. 29 Since the initiation of China's national syphilis control plan, syphilis screening has been widely integrated into HIV voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) services. More than 95% of people who received HIV testing services have undergone free syphilis testing. 30 Referral, treatment, and follow-up services would be provided to those diagnosed with syphilis. In Shenzhen, more than half of VCT sites are set in community health service centres, where a separate room is arranged for counselling and testing service.\n\nHowever, due to the low awareness of self-testing, older adults rarely positively seek the services. Meanwhile, most health staff are unwilling to provide the service actively because of limited experience, lack of time, discomfort in discussing sexual behaviours and STDs with older adults, stigma, ageism, etc. 28 Hence, enhanced training of healthcare providers and education of older adults are necessary.\n\nConsistent with the results of some previous studies, the prevalence of both syphilis seropositivity and active infection were higher among females than males. 21, 22 It may stem partly from the different physiology and anatomy of the genital organs between both sexes, leading to females being more likely to contract STDs in receptive vaginal sex behaviours. 31 Some studies have proved that the male-to-female transmission rate is higher than the female-to-male rate in certain STDs, such as HIV. 31, 32 Besides, a proportion of females have multiple sex partners during their lifetime. A previous study has found that the syphilis prevalence among husbands of 2261 syphilis-infected pregnant women was < 30%. 33 Premarital or extramarital sexual partners may greatly increase the risk of syphilis infection among females. Additionally, serological response differs between males and females. 34 Females are more likely to be serofast [defined as remaining positive in a 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   17 non-treponemal test and keeping the titre at a certain level (mostly 1:8 or below) after recommended therapy and follow-up 1 to 3 years according to syphilis stage] when comparing with males, 35 leading to more females staying in the state of active infection. The exact mechanism underlying this difference is unclear, but it may be partly associated with the varied immune system between both sexes. 34 Furthermore, men who have sex with men are considered a major high-risk subgroup for syphilis infection and are permanently deferred from blood donation in\n\nChina. 36 In this study, males were excluded if they reported they had ever engaged in homosexual behaviour in the health history questionnaire, which may be one of the reasons for the low syphilis prevalence among males.\n\nOur study has several limitations. First, limited financial and human resources restricted us in using a population-based design, which is considered as the gold standard in evaluating disease epidemics. 12 The choice of blood donors as population samples may result in potential bias, such as selection bias for age coverage and self-identified health conditions. Second, the syphilis seroprevalence among first-time donors was significantly higher than that among repeat donors. 12, 15 This study did not collect the information of first-time donors and repeat donors, which may lead to underestimation of syphilis seroprevalence. Third, false-negative results attributable to the window period of syphilis infection may result in an underestimation of syphilis seroprevalence. However, the residual risk of syphilis infection is very low according to a residual risk analysis conducted in Shenzhen. 37\n\nFourth, this study used two reagents in syphilis screening. Samples with one positive result or both positive results would be considered as problematic samples. This parallel testing method was strict and suitable for blood donors. However, we did not collect the data of each reagent and the positive predictive value cannot be calculated respectively.\n\nThis study provides an in-depth analysis of the association between syphilis seroprevalence and age.
