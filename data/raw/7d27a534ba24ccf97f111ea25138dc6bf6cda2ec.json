{"title": "Clinical Characteristics of Asthmatic Patients With Influenza- Like Illness and Risk for Severe Exacerbations in Mexico on behalf of the Mexico Emerging Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Network (LaRed) HHS Public Access", "body": "Acute respiratory infections are estimated to cause 3.9 million deaths annually; many present as influenza-like illnesses (ILI) 1 which can be caused by many different respiratory viruses. In patients with asthma, respiratory viral infections lead to exacerbations, potentially placing the patient's life at risk and creating an economic burden to the patient, to the health system and society 2 . Asthma exacerbations are responsible for half the cost of the disease and for 5000 deaths in the United States, every year 3 . Several reviews suggest that viral infections are present in up to 50% of adult exacerbations and over 60% of pediatric exacerbations 4, 5, 6 It is estimated that the prevalence of asthma in Mexico is around 5% 7; however, there are no estimates of the economic impact of an asthma exacerbation. Despite strong evidence linking viral infections to asthma exacerbations, the mechanisms by which viral infections trigger exacerbations are not fully understood 8. Despite \"virus-induced exacerbation\" being frequently used, there are few studies demonstrating this viral involvement in asthma exacerbation 9, 10, 11 . The association between viral infections and asthma exacerbations leads to questions regarding why some patients develop severe exacerbations and others do not. It is known that in hospitalized patients with ILI, a comorbidity associated with severity is asthma. We hypothesized that certain viral infections, patterns of ILI symptoms, and laboratory values may identify patients that develop severe asthma exacerbations that require subsequent hospitalization.\n\nFrom April 2010 throughout March 2014, the Mexico Emerging Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Network (LaRed) began recruitment a prospective cohort of patients with evaluating hospitalized and outpatient ILI. Participants were enrolled in six Hospitals, five in Mexico City and one in the central city of San Luis Potos\u00ed. Recruitment occurred year round and participants were enrolled in the study if they had at least one respiratory symptom and at least one of the following general symptoms: fever or feverishness, malaise, headache, myalgia, and/or chest pain. Once enrolled, participants had a baseline study visit to collect information on demographics, medical history, laboratory tests and clinical care needed (outpatient, hospitalization, intensive care admission). Follow up visits were carried out on days 14 and 28 where information on hospitalization, if any, was collected. This study was approved by the IRB of each participating institution; all study procedures were performed after obtaining the written patient informed consent and corresponding written assent if appropriate.\n\nThis subgroup analysis was restricted to those who self-reported a diagnosis of asthma upon enrollment, among adults and children five years of age and older. Patients were assigned case and control status based on symptoms reported at enrollment: Cases were patients with asthma exacerbation -reporting wheezing or dyspnea; controls were those not reporting these symptoms. We further characterized asthma exacerbations into \"severe\" -requiring hospitalization, and \"mild\" -not requiring hospitalization. Since asthma is difficult to ascertain in infants and toddlers, children younger than five years old were excluded from analysis.\n\nSymptoms were self-reported using a standardized questionnaire at enrollment. Patients were ask about the presence of: fever, dry cough, cough with phlegm, malaise, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, eye symptoms (bloodshot, watery), nasal symptoms (sneezing, drip, congestion) and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea). Physical exam was conducted to determine the presence of hyperemic pharynx. If requested during the course of clinical care, chest x-rays were performed. Hospitalization outcomes were extracted from medical records.\n\nA nasopharyngeal swab or nasal aspirate was collected at the time of recruitment. Sample processing has been described previously 12 . Viral pathogens were identified using the RespiFinder19 and RespiFinder22 kit (Previously RespiFinder Plus, PathoFinder BV, Maastricht, The Netherlands), which uses a multiplex PCR reaction to identify respiratory pathogens.\n\nAt enrollment, samples were collected for complete blood count with differential and biochemistry. Tests were performed locally using each site's standard laboratory procedures. If test were performed as part of the patient's standard of care, results were obtained from the medical chart.\n\nTo evaluate predictors of asthma exacerbations among those with ILI symptoms we compared patients with asthma with and without severe exacerbation. Patients with \"mild\" asthma exacerbations were excluded from the analysis since misclassification of exacerbation status was a concern. The American Thoracic Society concedes that mild exacerbations may be indistinguishable from a temporary loss of asthma control 13 .\n\nDifferences in characteristics between cases and controls were evaluated using chi-square tests or Fisher's exact test as appropriate for categorical variables, and the student t-tests or Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with a general linear model for unbalanced categories, for continuous variables. Predictors that were statistically significant in univariate analyses were selected for additional analyses with logistic regression to determine their independent association with the outcome. All models controlled for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and current cigarette smoke exposure (current smokers or exposed to second hand smoke.)\n\nStepwise model selection was used to identify the most parsimonious model. Covariates with univariate p-values < 0.2 were eligible for entry, and variables with p-values < 0.1 in the adjusted model were included in the final model. Analyses were conducted using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).\n\nOf 5,662 participants in the ILI 002 study, 486 met the eligibility criteria for this analysis (77 controls, 44 mild exacerbations, and 365 severe exacerbations). Characteristics of study participants are described in Table 1 . Those with severe exacerbations were older and more likely to be overweight/obese and to delay seeking medical care. Among all participants with asthma, 64.0% were found to have one or more viral infections ( Table 1 ). The most common viral infections were rhinovirus (29.4%), influenza A (13.2%) and coronavirus (10.1%). There was no difference in the type or number of viral infections when comparing those with severe infection and those without exacerbation.\n\nUnivariate analyses of ILI symptoms are included in Table 2 . Overall, patients with severe exacerbations reported fewer ILI symptoms as compared to those with no exacerbation. Cases were more likely to report cough with phlegm (76.7%/57.1%), and less likely to report muscle pain (32.6%/55.8%), eye (32.9%/53.3%), gastrointestinal (14.0%/33.8%) symptoms and present with sore throat (17.5%/49.4%). Overall, cases had more radiologic findings than controls, with the most common finding being abnormal air collection and rib/ diaphragm flattening (31.5%/1.3%); due to the large number of missing data, results should be interpreted with caution and no further analysis was conducted.\n\nThose with severe exacerbations were more likely to have leukocytosis (64.9%/23.4%), neutrophilia (80.3%/57.1%), and lymphocytopenia (81.1%/46.8%) as compared to those without exacerbations (Table 2 ). No differences were observed in CPK, LDH and C-reactive protein levels.\n\nBased on univariate associations, ten variables were identified to be assessed individually with multivariate logistic regressions (Table 3 ). In unadjusted analysis, being overweight/ obese increased the risk for severe exacerbations. However, after adjusting for age, sex and current smoke exposure, the association was no longer significant (OR=1.57 (0.92-2.67)). After adjusting for age, sex, current smoke exposure and overweight/obese status, cough with phlegm (OR=2. 38 After stepwise modeling of the 14 symptoms and five demographic variables (Figure 1 ), five key were identified: Cough with phlegm and delay in seeking medical care were associated with higher odds for severe asthma exacerbation, while muscle pain and nasal drip were associated with reduced odds.\n\nAs far as we know, this is the first study evaluating asthma exacerbations associated with Influenza Like-Illness (ILI) in Mexico. In our population 64% subjects had an etiological agent identified, among them: rhinovirus, influenza and coronavirus, which have been reported in the literature as associated with asthma and asthma exacerbations 14, 15 . Nonetheless, we did not find any virus associated with exacerbations and the distribution of viral infections among those with severe asthma exacerbations was the same as the entire asthmatic population overall.\n\nWhile it is generally accepted that viral infections can be associated with asthma exacerbations, there is controversy about how frequently exacerbations are triggered by viral infections. Some studies report an association, particularly among children, while others have not found that viruses are associated with asthma exacerbation 16, 17, 18 . Multiple studies have implicated rhinovirus as an important trigger, especially among children. Rhinovirus infections were found to be associated with hospital readmissions attributed to asthma among children less than 13 years old, a frequent cause of hospital admission due to asthma among children less than five years old 19 , and associated with asthma exacerbations among children 2-17 years old 20, 21 It has also been suggested that members of the Rhinovirus family might be more virulent and/or have a greater propensity to cause exacerbation 22, 23 . Given the aforementioned studies, we suspect that we were unable to detect an association because our patient population is mainly adults, and therefore our results are most relevant to adults with asthma, perhaps we did not find a stronger association as all participants had ILI. Our findings suggest that viral infections alone are not the only contributors to adult asthma exacerbations, and efforts should instead be made to assess other factors known to be involved in severe exacerbations, Asthma control 13, 24, 25, 26, 27 and environmental allergens 28 together with viral infections are likely responsible for the risk factors for hospital admission 11 .\n\nWe found that delaying medical care after onset of symptoms was associated with severe exacerbation. Receiving care might have prevented some asthmatics from deteriorating to an exacerbation. Our results suggest that asthmatic patients should be assessed by a medical practitioner as soon as they develop ILI symptoms, as delaying care might increase the risk of a severe exacerbation. Our findings mirror those from a recent study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) evaluation of the 2009 influenza pandemic, where they found that while most adults with underlying medical conditions were more likely to report ILI, they were not more likely to seek urgent medical attention compared with those who did not have an underlying medical condition 29 . Together, these findings suggest a need to better understand healthcare seeking behaviors and barriers among these patients.\n\nWe were unable to assess symptoms unique to severe exacerbations during viral infections since all subjects in this report had ILI. That is, we had no control group of patients who did not have an exacerbation without ILI.\n\nIn our study population the presence of leukocytosis, neutrophilia and lymphocytopenia were associated to severe exacerbations. Lymphocytopenia has been shown to be more closely associated with viral infections 30 . The presence of increased leukocytes and neutrophils may be associated with the heterogeneous inflammatory response, possibly attributable to pre-existing inflammation due to asthma that might be worsened by exposure to the virus. Production of chemokines by bronchial epithelium in response to a viral infection leads to the entry of neutrophils to the respiratory airways, as confirmed on experimental and naturally induced common cold among asthmatic patients 31 . Neutrophilia in the airways is associated with increased levels of elastase IL-6 and IL-8 and LDH, a marker of epithelial injury, but also with bacterial exacerbations. Therefore, it is not always clear which mechanism drives the neutrophil elevation. While these laboratory parameters are consistent with the high prevalence of viral infections among our patient population, these responses can also be seen in bacterial infections 31, 32 . Our results suggest that in patients with asthma and ILI, these laboratory tests might be useful to predict severe exacerbations, although we were not able to determine if these increases occurred before the exacerbation and whether the patient is suffering from a viral or bacterial infection.\n\nObesity has also been reported as a risk factor for severe asthma exacerbations 33, 34 . In a multicentric study in the United States, across 48 emergency rooms and 23 states it was found that adults who were obese had a higher risk of hospitalizations than those with normal weight 34 . In our population nearly 40% of participants were overweight/obese. However, after adjusting for age, current tobacco use and sex, we did not find an association with exacerbations. Asthma exacerbations are closely tied to asthma control, and the evidence linking obesity to asthma controls is mixed, with studies supporting 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 and refuting an association 39, 40, 41 . A Cochrane review of weight loss interventions to improve asthma control concluded that there may be weak associations but noted that research in this area is lacking 42 . Our failure to find an association could be confounded by our inability to assess asthma control prior to entry into the study. Additionally, given that our univariate association was significant, and our non-significant adjusted association was trending towards significance, our sample size may have been insufficient to detect a weak association.\n\nOur study had limitations that might impact the interpretation of our findings. First, since this is a secondary data analysis of an ILI study, participants were selected if they met criteria for ILI. Therefore, our findings are not generalizable to other types of asthma exacerbations, such as allergen, pollutant, cold, or exercise-induced exacerbations. Asthma was self-reported with no information being collected on accuracy of diagnosis, prescribed medications or adequacy of asthma symptom control. Information regarding environmental exposures was not collected beyond cigarette use and exposure, or on pulmonary function. This information might have been valuable to accurately classify participants, particularly those with mild exacerbations. We also only have information on asthma symptoms on the day of recruitment, and do not have data on symptoms prior to or after enrollment into the study. For this reason, there may be some misclassification of exacerbation status. However, we have no reason to believe that the misclassification bias is informative and thus only reduces the precision, but not the accuracy of our estimates. Finally, patients were recruited from specialty hospitals, therefore not representative of the overall population.\n\nDespite the limitations, this is the first analysis that highlights ILI symptoms as predictors of severe asthma exacerbations. We benefitted from having access to a standardized cohort that recruited over 5000 participants for four consecutive years, with data collection throughout the year, minimizing the potential for seasonal bias. Asthma patients included adults and children recruited from multiple communities in Mexico. Finally, our study confirmed previous studies conducted on virus-induced asthma exacerbations.\n\nDespite identifying a high proportion of viral infections in participants with ILI and asthma, the presence of respiratory viral infections was not predictive of exacerbations contrary to our hypothesis. ILI symptoms in patients with asthma not be useful to predict potential severe asthma exacerbation. However, those with asthma should be encouraged to seek early medical care when ILI symptoms occur to prevent serious asthma complications.\n\nSevere Exacerbation\n\nBase model included the following covariates: age, sex, current smoke exposure, overweight/obese, delay since onset of symptoms until seeking treatment in days, and 14 symptom variables (fever, dry cough, cough with phlegm, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, bloodshot eyes, watery eyes, sneezing, nasal drip, nasal congestion, nausea, diarrhea, and malase). Backwards stepwise regression was used to identify covariates elibigible for inclusion in the model (p-value less than 0.2), and allowed covariates with an adjusted pvalue less than 0.1 to be included in the final model. Logistic regression model 1 was adjusted for age, sex, and current smoke exposure. All remaining models were adjusted for age, sex, current smoke exposure, and overweight/obese status."}
