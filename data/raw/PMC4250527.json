So far, factors that determine the variable outcomes of HBV infection are little known. Besides pathogenesis of virus, environment factors, ethnic differences and genetic susceptibility have also been reported to have an effect on the progression of this liver disease[2]. Recently, a number of studies have shown that genetic polymorphisms of cytokines have a correlation with the outcomes of HBV infection[3],[4]. However, controversies exist among similar studies.\n\nInterferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) is known as a Th1 cytokine, and plays a pivotal role in defending against the invasion of intracellular pathogens and the induction of an immune-mediated inflammatory response[5]. During viral infections, the expression pattern of cytokines is changed and IFN-\u03b3 level is increased[6]. Interestingly, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the IFN-\u03b3 gene intron (at position +874) was involved in transcriptional regulation of IFN-\u03b3[7] and HBV susceptibility[8]. Some studies demonstrated that patients carrying rs2430561 AA genotype in the IFN-\u03b3 gene had a high risk of susceptibility to chronic infection of HBV[9]-[11], while Cheong et al.[12] observed no significant difference in susceptibility risk.\n\nInterleukin 28B (IL28B, interferon-\u03bb3 [IFN-\u03bb3]) is another cytokine involved in the host immune response to virus infection, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HBV. There also had been several studies on the relationship between chronic HBV infection, HBV clearance and genetic polymorphism of the IL28B gene rs12979860 C/T. However, the results are inconsistent. For instance, Ren et al.[13] found that the frequency of CC homozygosity was significantly higher in healthy controls than that in chronic hepatitis B patients, but other studies did not find such difference[14],[15].\n\nIt was reported that estrogen could directly activate the promoter of IFN-\u03b3 and this effect was mediated by estrogen receptors (ERs, ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2)[16]. The expression and function of ER might be influenced by its own variation and thus modulate diverse pathologies correlated with prognosis and survival of chronic hepatopathy[17],[18]. Previous studies[19]-[21] reported an association of ER polymorphisms with susceptibility to chronic HBV infection and other chronic hepatic diseases. Deng et al.[19] found that, as a haplotype-tagging SNP, ER\u03b1 rs2077647 T/C genotype (previous reported c.30T > C, exon 1) had an influence on susceptibility to persistent HBV infection and HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma. It was also observed that the relative messenger RNA levels of the at-risk C allele of rs2077647 were consistently higher than those of the T allele in the heterozygous cells[22]. Therefore, it is rational to consider that ER\u03b1 may be a biological candidate susceptibility gene for chronic HBV infection.\n\nTo our knowledge, the recent results about the associations of IFN-\u03b3 rs2430561 T/A, IL28B rs12979860 C/T and ER\u03b1 rs2077647 T/C gene polymorphisms with the outcomes of HBV infection in many studies are inconsistent. Therefore, to assess the associations between these SNPs and the outcomes of HBV infection, we performed a meta-analysis of all the published observational studies.\n\nPubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.-nih.gov/pubmed), web of science (http://www. thomsonscientific.com.cn/), CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) (http://epub.cnki.net/kns/default.htm) and Chinese Biomedicine databases (http://www.sinomed.ac.cn) were searched (the last search was updated in July 2013) using the search terms: \u2018hepatitis B\u2019 or \u2018HBV\u2019, \u2018polymorphism\u2019 or \u2018mutation\u2019 or \u2018variant\u2019, \u2018interferon-gamma\u2019 or \u2018interferon \u03b3\u2019 or \u2018interleukin 28B\u2019 or \u2018estrogen receptor alpha\u2019 or \u2018estrogen receptor \u03b1\u2019. The results were supplemented with manual searches of references of final published articles. Review articles, editorials or conference abstracts were excluded. When more than one of the same patient population was included in several publications, only the most recent or complete study was used in this meta-analysis. A flow diagram of the study selection process is shown in Fig. 1.\n\nInclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients with no detectable HBV infection were defined as healthy controls (HCs); patients whose serum HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) was negative but HBV surface antibody (anti-HBs) and/or HBV core antibody (anti-HBc) were positive were defined as self-limiting infection controls (SLCs); patients who had been positive for HBsAg or HBV DNA for at least 6 months were included as persistent HBV infection cases (PIs); (2) design type of the study was a case-control study; (3) the study aimed to examine the relationship between the IFN-\u03b3 rs2430561 or IL28B rs12979860 or ER\u03b1 rs2077647 T/C polymorphisms and clearance and/or susceptibility of persistent HBV infection; (4) the study provided sufficient data for examining an odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI); (5) the patients recruited in the studies had not received prior HBV-related treatment. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) the study fitted no diagnosis criteria; (2) the study was not a case-control study; (3) the study reported no usable data.\n\nTwo investigators (ST and JW) extracted information from all eligible publications independently according to the inclusion criteria listed above. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. The following information was extracted from each publication, including name of the first author, year of publication, country/region of the first or corresponding author, ethnicity, number of cases and controls, genotyping methods, and polymorphisms of IFN-\u03b3 rs2430561, IL28B rs12979860 or ER\u03b1 rs2077647. If the information mentioned in this section and above section was unavailable in relevant articles, a request was sent to corresponding author for additional data.\n\nThe statistical analysis was conducted using Stata 10.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). At the beginning of the analysis, we assessed Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in the controls for each study using Chi-square test (P \u2264 0.05 was considered as a deviation from HWE). Then, the risks (ORs, and 95% CIs) of persistent HBV infection associated with IFN-\u03b3 rs2430561, IL28B rs12979860 and ER\u03b1 rs2077647 were estimated for each study based on extracted genotype data. We also carried out stratified analyses by ethnicity (Asian and Caucasian) and sources (hospital-based and population-based). Moreover, sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the stability of results while omitting the study not in HWE, one at a time. Q-statistic and I2 statistic were performed to evaluate statistical heterogeneity. When P > 0.10 for Q-statistic or I2 \u2264 50%, heterogeneity was considered to be absent and a fixed effects model was used; otherwise, a random effects model was used. Several methods were used to assess the potential for publication bias, including visual inspection of asymmetry in funnel plots, Begg's test and Egger's test. P \u2264 0.05 was considered to be representative of significant publication bias.\n\nA total of 24 relevant studies (Table 1) evaluating IFN-\u03b3 rs2430561 T/A, IL28B rs12979860 C/T and ER\u03b1 rs2077647 T/C SNPs were found in our search, and the characteristics of each study are summarized according to the polymorphisms in Table 1. The countries in which these studies were carried out include China, South Korea, Brazil, Iran, Spain, United States, Italy and Romania. Eighteen studies were on Asians, 5 on Caucasians and 1 on Brazilians, which included mixed ancestry of Caucasians (European), African and \u201cother\u201d (Amerindian). Sixteen of the 24 eligible studies were hospital-based case-control studies while the remaining 8 were population-based. The distribution of genotypes in the controls of all studies was in agreement with HWE except for 4 studies[10],[11],[13],[19].\n\nWe compared persistent HBV infection cases with healthy controls to discover the relation of IFN-\u03b3 rs2430561 T/A, IL28B rs12979860 C/T and ER\u03b1 rs2077647 T/C SNPs to persistent HBV infection susceptibility. As shown in Table 2, the IFN-\u03b3 rs2430561 T allele was associated with significantly reduced persistent HBV infection risk (T vs. A: OR, 0.690; 95% CI [0.490, 0.971]; P  =  0.033) (Fig. 2A), while the ER\u03b1 rs2077647 T allele significantly increased the risk of persistent HBV infection (T vs. C: OR, 1.678; 95% CI [1.212, 2.323]; P  =  0.002). In addition, the results of TT vs. CC and CC vs. CT+TT implied that ER\u03b1 rs2077647 CC might play a role in protecting individuals against HBV persistence (TT vs. CC: OR, 4.109; 95% CI, [2.609, 6.473]; P < 0.001; CC vs. CT+TT: OR, 0.301; 95% CI, [0.199, 0.454]; P < 0.001) (Fig. 2C and D, respectively). No evidence of a relationship between IL28B rs12979860 C/T and persistent HBV infection risk was observed in all comparison models.\n\nWe also performed stratified analyses for Asian and hospital-based individuals, and the results were still stable (Table 3). Caucasian and population-based subgroup analyses were not conducted because only 1 or 2 studies were available. Interestingly, for the comparison of ER\u03b1 rs2077647 TT vs. TC+CC, significantly increased risks were observed in the Asian and hospital-based population (Asian subgroup, TT vs. TC+CC: OR, 1.778; 95% CI, [1.004, 3.149]; P  =  0.048; hospital-based subgroup, TT vs. TC+CC: OR, 2.204; 95% CI, [1.140, 4.264]; P  =  0.019), but not in the overall analysis.\n\nWe also compared persistent HBV infection cases with self-limiting infection controls to discover the relationship between the three target SNPs and HBV infection clearance. As shown in Table 4, the meta-analysis provided estimated odds ratios and P-value of all comparison models, but only IFN-\u03b3 rs2430561 TT vs. AA showed significant difference (TT vs. AA: OR, 0.555; 95% CI, [0.359, 0.856]; P  =  0.008) (Fig. 2B), indicating that carriers of IFN-\u03b3 rs2430561 TT genotype were more likely to clear HBV spontaneously compared with those carrying AA genotype, and there was no significant correlation of IL28B rs12979860 C/T polymorphism with HBV clearance. We did not conduct meta-analysis of ER\u03b1 rs2077647 T/C because only 1 study[19] was available.\n\nIn subgroup analysis of SNP IFN-\u03b3 rs2430561, since all the studies were from Asian and hospital-based, and the results were the same as in Table 3. Moreover, for IL28B rs12979860 C/T polymorphism, the results of subgroup analyses were similar to those of overall analyses. Namely, no significant association of IL28B rs12979860 C/T polymorphism with HBV clearance was observed in both overall analysis and stratified analysis.\n\nThere were 4 studies[10],[11],[13],[19] not in HWE within our included studies. In the sensitivity analysis, the influence of these 4 studies on the pooled OR was examined by repeating the meta-analysis while omitting each of them, one at a time. When excluded the 4 studies mentioned above, most of the estimated pooled OR did not change at all. However, when the study by Zhang et al.[11] was omitted, the result of IFN-\u03b3 rs2430561 T vs. A model showed no significant association with susceptibility to persistent HBV infection. Furthermore, for IFN-\u03b3 rs2430561 TT vs. AA model, no significance was observed on the clearance of HBV when the study was excluded[10].\n\nQ-statistic and I2 statistic were used to evaluate the statistical heterogeneity and several comparison models were found to have heterogeneities (Table 2 and Table 4). Thus, a random-effects model was employed in these studies. Begg's funnel plot and Egger's test were performed to assess the publication bias of the studies (Table 2 and Table 4). As a result, no evidence of publication bias was found in all comparison models.\n\nIt is well known that the elimination of HBV is attributed to a coordinated innate and adaptive humoral and cell-mediated immune response. During this immune process, cytokines play a crucial role in modulating almost all phases of host immune response. Genetic polymorphisms of the cytokines and factors regulating cytokines may influence the expression of cytokines, thus determining the various clinical outcomes of HBV infection.\n\nAs one of the most representative Th1 cytokines, IFN-\u03b3 plays an important role in the clearance of HBV. On one hand, in acute self-limited HBV infection, the antigen-specific fraction of T cells selectively secrete Th1-type cytokines, with a predominance of IFN-\u03b3[23]. On the other hand, cell clones from persons with chronic HBV infection produce a predominantly type 2 response[24]. IFN-\u03b3 rs2430561T/A is a SNP located in the first intron of the IFN-\u03b3 gene, which is confirmed to coincide with the nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) binding region[25]. It had been demonstrated that possession of rs2430561T and A alleles should be associated with high and low IFN-\u03b3 expression, respectively[7],[25]. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis and concluded that IFN-\u03b3 rs2430561 T allele was associated with significantly reduced risk of persistent HBV infection and the carriers with the IFN-\u03b3 rs2430561 TT genotype were more likely to clear HBV spontaneously compared with those carrying the IFN-\u03b3 rs2430561 AA genotype. In stratified analyses, the results did not change in Asian and hospital-based subgroups. However, when studies not in HWE were excluded, the results showed no significance. Nevertheless, it was still meaningful that IFN-\u03b3 rs2430561 T allele and TT genotype could up-regulate the expression of IFN-\u03b3, rendering these subjects less prone to persistent HBV infection. Most importantly, more functional analyses should be conducted to demonstrate it.\n\nThis meta-analysis documented that the SNP 4 kilobases upstream of IL28B (rs12979860) was not associated with outcomes of HBV infection. However, prior studies had shown that this SNP correlated with both spontaneous and anti-viral treatment-induced HCV clearance[26],[27]. These conflicting results suggested that although HBV and HCV shared a similar natural history, pathogenesis and transmission modality[28], rs12979860 might alter the immune responses against HCV but not HBV. Potentially, this could be explained by the characteristics of IL28B. By triggering a cascade through the JAK-STAT (Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription, JAK-STAT) pathway, IL28B up-regulates the IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and produces an antiviral state[29]. In addition, when used as a vaccine adjuvant, IL28B could significantly decrease splenic regulatory T cells, increase splenic and peripheral blood CD8+ T cells, and lead to increased antigen-specific perforin induction and degranulation[30]. These adaptive immune responses might be more important in HCV infection[15]. Therefore, IL28B plays a more important role in the infection of HCV than that of HBV.\n\nChronic hepatitis B progresses at unequal rates between males and females, being more frequent in men than in women[31]. This sexual dimorphism might be due to lower expression of estrogen and a reduced response to the action of estrogen[32]. Furthermore, It was reported that estrogen could directly activate the promoter of IFN-\u03b3 and this effect was mediated by estrogen receptors (ERs, ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2)[16]. The production and function of ER might be influenced by its own variation, and thus influence the diverse pathologies of chronic hepatopathy[17],[18]. According to our findings, compared to CT+TT, ER\u03b1 rs2077647 CC genotype might play a role in protecting individuals against HBV persistence, since the risk of persistent HBV infection was reduced to 0.289 (95% CI, [0.187, 0.446]; P < 0.001). However, ER\u03b1 rs2077647 T/C is a synonymous polymorphism located in exon 1, and Zhai et al.[22] investigated that such effect could be caused by some other functional polymorphisms (such as a [TA]n repeat and a PvuII RFLP) in LD with rs2077647 T/C. Thus, to date, the potential function of rs2077647 T/C could not be confirmed, and further investigation was required to explore the exact mechanism and association of ER\u03b1 polymorphisms with outcomes of HBV infection.\n\nIt should be noted that there were certain limitations to our study. Firstly, due to the limited availability of published results, the number of studies included in each meta-analysis was small. We expected that as more studies become available, an accurate estimation of the relationship of the 3 SNPs with susceptibility and clearance to persistence HBV infection would be obtained. Secondly, several comparison models were found to have heterogeneities, and the genotype distribution also showed deviation from HWE in four studies. These could be attributed to ethnic differences (Asian versus non-Asian descent), potential selection bias (in-patients versus outpatients) or other factors. The third limitation of this analysis is that we did not have original data for all studies to account for other factors, like presence of co-infection with HIV or immune deficiency, genotypes of HBV and transmission modality that may modify the risk estimates. In spite of these, meta-analysis is a powerful statistical tool to summarize inconsistent results from different studies, so our meta-analysis provided more convincing conclusions.\n\nIn summary, this meta-analysis suggested that IFN-\u03b3 rs2430561 T/A and ER\u03b1 rs2077647 T/C genetic polymorphisms were associated with the outcomes of HBV infection, but association between IL28B rs12979860 C/T and HBV infection was not found. Since limitations were present in our study, it is critical that lager and well-designed multicenter studies should be performed to re-evaluate the associations. Moreover, further studies incorporating diverse populations and functional assays are warranted to validate and extend our findings."}
