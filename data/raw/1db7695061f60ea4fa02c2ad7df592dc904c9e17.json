{"title": "Public Health 886 www", "body": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has emphasised the importance of the Asia-Pacifi c region as a potential epicentre of emerging diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian infl uenza. During the past three decades, 30 new infectious agents have been detected in this region. 1 Since 2003, a total of 49 countries and one special administrative region (Hong Kong) have had outbreaks of the H5N1 subtype of infl uenza A in birds. 2 The H5N1 virus will continue to pose an important public-health threat in the short term. 2 More than 80% of the reported deaths from H5N1 have taken place in southeast Asia.\n\nIn a resolution issued in April, 2005, 3 WHO expressed concern about the general inadequacy of global preparedness for pandemic infl uenza. WHO's global infl uenza preparedness plan, which was launched in 1999, was updated in 2005. The plan outlines components that countries should include in their national preparedness plans to ensure an eff ective response. 4 In 2005, WHO published a checklist to facilitate preparedness planning. 5 The aims of such planning were to reduce transmission; decrease the incidence of new cases, hospital admissions, and deaths; maintain essential services; and reduce the socioeconomic consequences of a pandemic. 5 In our own assessment of European national preparedness plans 6 we concluded that although Europe was broadly well prepared, important gaps, weaknesses, and inconsistencies remained. We identifi ed a need for operational planning, in particular, to be strengthened. We also suggested that although European countries had explicitly expressed their interest in cooperating with international institutions such as the European Centre for Disease Control and WHO, regional cooperation between countries was inadequate. Here, we have analysed pandemic infl uenza plans from selected countries in the Asia-Pacifi c region, emphasising specifi c concerns about preparedness in this region.\n\nUsing a data-extraction method developed from WHO's checklist for infl uenza epidemic preparedness, 4,5 we aimed to assess the national infl uenza preparedness plans of eight countries (Australia, Cambodia, China [and Hong Kong], Indonesia, Laos, New Zealand, Thailand, and Vietnam) (table). However, we could not obtain copies of any national preparedness plans for Cambodia, Laos, or Indonesia. We included plans that were published between Jan 1, 2002 and Feb 28, 2006. The six plans were reviewed according to seven themes: planning and coordination; surveillance; public-health inter ventions; health-system response; maintenance of essential services; communication; and putting plans into action. 18 Some countries-Thailand, China, and, to a lesser degree, Vietnam-had set out a strategic vision to strengthen future capacity in preparedness planning. Others, including Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand, *China has issued several documents addressing preparedness, planning, and contingency implementation: Preparedness and contingency planning for infl uenza pandemic; Emergency planning for human infections-pandemic outbreak of avian infl uenza; Guidance for diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control of infections of avian infl uenza; National emergency planning for animal pandemic outbreak; National emergency planning for highly pathogenic avian infl uenza; Contingency implementation plan for the prevention and control on highly pathogenic avian infl uenza in autumn and winter in 2005; and Contingency working procedure of prevention and control on pathogenic avian infl uenza in autumn and winter in 2005. 8 Table: Country pandemic infl uenza plans took a strategic approach similar to that of most European plans. These strategic plans focused on management of currently available resources and preparation for the deployment of resources such as stockpiled antiviral agents and vaccines. The polarisation of approaches in the region contrasts with the uniform approach taken by countries in Europe. The plans of Hong Kong, Australia, and New Zealand compared very favourably in terms of completeness and quality with the best European plans. However, as in Europe, all of the plans contained some gaps. The plans of lower-income countries in the region addressed several issues that were largely neglected by most European plans. The potential therefore exists for countries (including those which are still formulating their plans) to draw on the strengths of preparedness plans developed by other countries. The panel summarises some strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in the preparedness plans of these selected Asia-Pacifi c countries. For brevity, diff erences between countries and areas of coherence are presented by comparing planned public-health interventions.\n\nThere were some substantial diff erences between the strategies described in the Asia-Pacifi c plans and those in Europe. As any outbreak in an Asia-Pacifi c country would probably originate in a rural area, all the Asia-Pacifi c plans focused on this setting, and on early containment strategies. For example, specifi c situations with cases in animals were included in the planning for human pandemic phases. As a result, the Asia-Pacifi c countries more closely and explicitly linked their planned responses to human infl uenza pandemics with those for avian infl uenza. The Asia-Pacifi c plans also emphasised the integration of human and animal health more than did the equivalent plans in Europe. The Hong Kong plan was especially strong in its attention to issues that could be important to countries of southeast Asia and that had not been fully addressed elsewhere. These issues included the need for improved exchange of surveillance information between health and animal sectors, the capacity for joint investigation and response, and the education of poultry smallholders and wet-market poultry workers. Another notable strength of the Asia-Pacifi c plans was that the countries we selected had incorporated lessons learned from the recent past, including from H5N1 and SARS outbreaks, into their pandemic preparedness plans. 11, 13 For example, during the SARS outbreak, databases linked to the police system for tracking down criminals were used to coordinate mass-contact tracing. This so-called major incident and disaster support system will, during an infl uenza pandemic, be used again. A further important diff erence between the Asia-Pacifi c countries' plans and those in Europe was their focus on the early containment of disease, and their coherence in strategies such as social distancing. For example, all countries in the Asia-Pacifi c region recommended use of travel restrictions or screening measures. Whether this coherence was by design is unclear.\n\nThe common reliance on such strategies might also indicate that these countries had few supplies of antiviral drugs and little access to vaccines. Many of the gaps identifi ed in the plans of European countries were more acute in the plans of low-income Asia-Pacifi c countries. For example, countries had not done suffi cient planning to identify priority groups to receive vaccines and antiviral drugs; make logistical arrangements for distribution of scarce resources; develop strategies to maintain essential services; anticipate the probable response of diff erent health systems during emergency situations; or ensure that preparedness plans could be implemented.\n\nRegional institutions can have an important role in encouraging coherent responses to transnational public-health threats. European institutions are coordinating national plans in an attempt to align their approaches. This is proving to be a substantial challenge, 19 but one from which other regions might be able to learn. Even in the face of a global pandemic, public health is still governed by the principle of national sovereignty; nation states retain ultimate authority in decision-making, and regional institutions can only off er guidance and support. But guidance and support can be a powerful means of ensuring coherence. By working closely with countries, institutions might be able to plan for and respond eff ectively to issues that could become politically charged. The new International Health Regulations have been substantially improved by\n\n\u2022 All recognised the eff ect of a potential infl uenza pandemic and gave political support to preparedness planning.\n\n\u2022 All linked surveillance and response measures for animals and humans, including specifi c measures targeted at bird handlers \u2022 All incorporated wide multisector cooperation, involving major stakeholders from health, animal, and civil-response sectors.\n\n\u2022 All proposed measures for early containment, on the basis that an original outbreak within their country was a likely scenario.\n\n\u2022 Several recognised the need for surveillance to be strengthened, and for laboratory capacity in the region to be reinforced. They contained provisions for developing fi nancial and organisational support.\n\n\u2022 All discussed use of various social distancing measures, including travel restrictions (both internal and international).\n\n\u2022 Most outlined strategies for organisation of the response from health services, relying mainly on specialised units. Several countries had advanced preparations for cooperation with other countries in the region (eg, New Zealand's arrangement with Australia about supply of vaccine).\n\n\u2022 All addressed education and awareness for the population, and in many countries educational materials have already been developed.\n\n\u2022 Several outlined ethical principles that govern access to scarce resources.\n\n\u2022 Several, such as the Hong Kong plan, included the private health-care sector in preparation and implementation.\n\n(Continues on next page) measures to strengthen global surveillance and response, and make it incumbent on states to develop capacity in these areas. But national responses aimed at controlling potential pandemics remain just that-national. Although the Association of SouthEast Asian Nations (ASEAN) remains a loose coalition, it could nevertheless draw on the early experience of initiatives such as the European Centre for Disease Control, and attempt to steer the preparedness planning of Asia-Pacifi c countries. The international community has recently been giving substantial support and attention to the issue of emerging infectious diseases in the Asia-Pacifi c region. For example, WHO's Asia-Pacifi c strategy for emerging diseases aimed to strengthen capacities to detect, prepare for, and respond to disease, and off ered a framework to achieve this in the short, medium, and long term. 1 Although the WHO Strategy addressed the broader notion of emerging diseases, the threat of pandemic infl uenza was clearly a driving factor and provided a sense of urgency. The document did not, however, \"contain implementation guidelines or work plans, as these will be developed later, as part of implementation planning\". 1 The importance of coherence between national approaches has been acknowledged by political commitment from ASEAN, along with other institutions such as WHO, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, and the Asian Development Bank. The fi rst East Asia Summit on avian infl uenza, held on Dec 14, 2005, promoted the \"active cooperation and various regional initiatives of ASEAN in responding to the challenges posed by avian infl uenza, inter-alia, through strengthening institutional linkages, developing partnership with all stakeholders, sharing information and coordinating regional initiatives\". 20 Substantial investment has been planned for eff orts to combat avian infl uenza and pandemic human infl uenza in the region. National governments have committed additional funds, the World Bank has launched a programme of support, the Asian Development Bank has contributed funds, and a January, 2006, conference in Beijing pledged US$1\u00b79 billion. 21, 22 Concerns have been raised within the region, however, that much of this money would not be new, that many of the funds would be made available as loans rather than as grants, and that tangible benefi ts to populations in the region would not be certain. The slow pace of disbursement of funding has also been criticised. 23\n\nThe quality and completeness with which the plans of Hong Kong, Australia, and New Zealand addressed the most important issues of preparedness planning were high. The key institutions in these countries had developed comprehensive guidance manuals to facilitate national responses to outbreaks of infl uenza. By contrast, the plans of Thailand, China, and (to a lesser extent) Vietnam consisted of development strategies for building the capacity to detect, prepare and respond to disease in the future. Several countries seemed not to have fi nalised their plans yet.\n\nWe suggest that preparedness plans that focus on developmental strategies need to be complemented with operational guides that provide greater detail about implementation of the plans and management of the available resources and existing health-care capacity. A pandemic might not wait until capacity is developed. These operational guides would need to be modifi ed as capacity grows.\n\nOverall, the weaknesses of preparedness plans in the Asia-Pacifi c region were much the same as those described for Europe. Most plans did not adequately address operational responsibility at the local level; logistical aspects of vaccination and antiviral stockpiling, distribution, and delivery; or the maintenance of essential services.\n\nThere were wide disparities in the preparedness of affl uent nations and lower-income nations. Perhaps with good reason, several low-income and middle-income countries in the region perceived that they would be disadvantaged in the event of a serious global pandemic, despite the likelihood that they would be at its epicentre.\n\n(Continued from previous page)\n\n\u2022 Although most identifi ed which organisation would be responsible for achieving a specifi c response, operational responsibility remained somewhat unclear, especially at the local level.\n\n\u2022 All countries organised their responses according to pandemic phases which identify specifi c alert mechanisms. Because in some plans these phases diff er from WHO pandemic phases, confusion could occur during the management of a regional or international crisis.\n\n\u2022 Some focused solely on situations involving outbreaks of H5N1 that originated within their borders, and did not discuss measures to address an imported epidemic.\n\n\u2022 Several combined short-term and long-term actions. Some needed to create operational plans for pandemic response, to supplement long-term capacity development.\n\n\u2022 Most did not detail drug strategies or logistics for provision of antiviral drugs to the population. Most did not identify or enumerate groups within the population who should receive these drugs as a priority. Several described stockpiling of antivirals at a level that would only provide coverage for a very small proportion of the population. They did not clearly specify treatment or use of prophylactics.\n\n\u2022 Most had poorly developed policies for vaccination of the population. Some discussed the inadequate vaccine manufacturing capacity in the region, and suggested that access could be very restricted. Several countries (China, Thailand) discussed the possibility of setting up local production. Only a few plans defi ned priority groups for vaccination.\n\n\u2022 Most relied on health care institutions for the treatment of infl uenza patients (notably special infectious diseases hospitals). Some designated specifi c facilities as hospitals for infectious diseases. Few developed the possibility of caring for patients at home.\n\n\u2022 Many did not make adequate provision for the maintenance of essential services (although this issue might be covered in generic contingency plans).\n\n\u2022 Most addressed communication, although some did not plan on a phase-by-phase basis. Strategic communication could prove critical during a pandemic, and needs to be improved in some countries.\n\n\u2022 Several did not provide adequate operational procedures for key stakeholders during each phase of the pandemic. The Thai plan in particular retained the format of a strategic framework rather than an operational guide.\n\nUnder current plans, the distribution of scarce resources (notably antiviral drugs and vaccines) would probably be inequitable. Most affl uent countries have stockpiled antiviral drugs and, in the event of a pandemic, could also rely on their capacity to produce vaccines or agreements to obtain vaccine rapidly. By contrast, one could argue that lower-income countries in the Asia-Pacifi c region would fi nd it diffi cult to access suffi cient quantities of these globally scarce resources. These countries also face challenges in dealing with other communicable diseases. Without a greater international commitment to share scarce stocks of antiviral drugs and vaccines more equitably, countries in the Asia-Pacifi c region will not be able to access these resources, or to distribute them eff ectively. Massive logistical challenges would have to be met for any pandemic, which will probably originate in this region, to be contained at an early stage. 24 If this were to prove unattainable, some have warned of a potential risk that poor countries in the region would be reluctant to cooperate with the international community-eg, by providing information to assist with disease surveillance, or isolates of the virus to facilitate vaccine development and production. Countries might choose not to prioritise these tasks if faced with uncertain returns and a range of other pressing demands.\n\nIn an interconnected world, investment in preparedness planning should provide benefi ts that extend beyond infl uenza pandemic control. However, the global eff ort to prepare for and control outbreaks of the disease will need to ensure that the countries that will probably be aff ected early on in any global pandemic receive support. The necessary support would involve reinforcement of the capacity of health systems in these countries. It would also need to extend to allocation of scarce resources in a globally equitable fashion. The next pandemic will test notions of global solidarity. If the pandemic were to occur tomorrow, we would probably be found wanting.\n\nThis research was undertaken through an unrestricted educational grant from F Hoff mann-La Roche.
