{"title": "Influenza A virus-dependent remodeling of pulmonary clock function in a mouse model of\nCOPD", "body": "Chronic (6 months) air- and CS-exposed mice were infected intranasally with 120\nHAU IAV (H3N2). Before infection (Day 0), we did not observe a significant\ndifference in body weight among the experimental groups. The body weight of mice\nin both IAV-infected groups dropped significantly on days 1\u20133\npost-infection, with a slightly more dramatic decline in the CS+Virus group\n(Fig. 1a). This suggests that chronic CS-exposed mice\nexhibited greater mortality following IAV infection. Indeed, IAV infection in\nchronic CS-exposed mice produced a 14.1% reduction in survival within 9 days of\ninfection (Fig. 1b). As reported, there was no significant\ndifference in the body weight and mortality between the chronic air- and\nCS-exposed mice30. We found that chronic air and CS-exposed mice\ninfected with IAV showed significant reduction in body weight compared to\ncorresponding controls at the end of chronic exposure or day 9 post-infection\n(Supplementary Fig. 2b). Thus, while IAV infection alone\n(Air+Virus) has modest effects, infection of mice following chronic CS exposure\n(COPD/emphysema model) significantly increases mortality.\n\nWe have previously reported that mice exposed to 10 days of CS (acute exposure\nmodel) during the active phase show reduced locomotor activity associated with\nincreased inflammation30. Similarly, mice exposed to chronic CS\nshowed significantly reduced activity beginning 5 days after the first exposure\nthat persisted for much of the exposure period30. In the present\nstudy, chronic CS-exposed mice infected with IAV (CS+Virus) showed a significant\nreduction in locomotor activity after infection that persisted for the duration\nof measurement (9 days post-infection; Fig.\n1c\u2013d). Chronic air-exposed mice infected with influenza\n(Air+Virus) showed an initial reduction in locomotor activity 1\u20135\ndays after infection with a trough 5\u20136 days after infection followed\nby a modest recovery by day 9 after infection (Fig.\n1c\u2013d). Actograms clearly reveal that the CS+Virus group\nshowed significantly reduced locomotor activity post-infection (lower right\npanel) when compared to Air+Virus, air- and CS-exposed mice (Fig.\n1d and Supplementary Fig. 2a). Limiting our\nanalysis to the dark phase reveals that the primary influence of IAV infection\nwas a reduction in nighttime activity, which was further suppressed in those\nmice previously exposed to chronic CS (Fig. 1c). The\nperiod of locomotor activity in L:D during days 1\u20138 post IAV\ninfection was very similar between air and CS groups, whereas the Air+Virus and\nCS+Virus groups showed increased variation in period between animals although\nthe mean was not statistically different from controls (Fig.\n1e). Analysis of behavior as a function of daily distribution (day\nvs. night) emphasizes the effect of IAV treatment in vivo (Supplementary Fig. 3a-d). Control (air) and Air+Virus infected mice\nwere primarily active (70\u201380% activity) during the dark phase and\nless active (20\u201330%) during the light phase from day 2 to day 9\npost-saline infusion (Supplementary Fig. 3a and c). In three\nof the four groups, we detected a transient change in the distribution of\nactivity on day 1 post-infusion regardless of treatment, suggesting that the\ninfusion procedure acutely and temporarily altered activity (Supplementary Fig. 3a\u2013d). In agreement with our previous\nreport, chronic CS-exposed mice displayed a distribution of locomotor activity\nsimilar to air-exposed mice with the majority (70\u201380%) of activity\nlimited to the dark phase (Supplementary Fig. 3b)30. Following IAV infection in chronic CS-exposed mice nighttime\nactivity declined and daytime activity increased from days 3\u20137\npost-infection such that we detected no difference between day and night\nactivity levels by day 7 (Supplementary Fig. 3d). By day\n8\u20139 post-infection the CS+Virus mice showed recovery of their normal\nnighttime (70\u201380%) and daytime (20\u201330%) distribution of\nactivity (Supplementary Fig. 3d).\n\nTo dissect the role of clock regulatory proteins in response to respiratory\ninfection, we measured the response of BMAL1 KO mice and wild-type littermates\nto IAV infection. Similar to mice that had been exposed to CS, BMAL1 KO and WT\nlittermates were infected intranasally with 120 HAU (H3N2) IAV. Before IAV\ninfection (Day 0), there was no significant difference in body weight between WT\nand BMAL1 KO mice (Fig. 2a). The body weight of WT and\nBMAL1 KO IAV infected mice dropped by day 2 post-infection and remained low\nuntil day 8 post-infection when compared to control mice of both strains (Fig. 2a). BMAL1 KO-Virus infected mice showed increased\nmortality beginning 5 days post-infection and by day 9 all of the BMAL1 KO mice\ninfected with IAV was deceased (Fig. 2b). WT-Virus\ninfected mice showed increased mortality beginning 7 days post-infection and\nreached a total of 38.5% mortality by day 9 post-infection (Fig.\n2b). There was a significant difference in the body weight and\nmortality of WT-Virus compared to BMAL1 KO-Virus infected mice. This suggests\nthat BMAL1 plays an important role in the host response to IAV infection.\nFurther, our data suggest that circadian disruption may enhance the severity of\ninfection, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality.\n\nLocomotor activity of BMAL1 KO and WT littermates was monitored before (5 days)\nand after IAV infection (1\u20139 days post-infection). Regardless of\ngenotype, IAV infection significantly reduced activity (Fig.\n2c\u2013d and Supplementary Fig. 2b). Both\nBMAL1 KO and WT mice showed significant reductions in daily activity on days\n1\u20139 post-infection (Fig. 2c\u2013d and\nSupplementary Fig. 2b). The period of locomotor activity\nin L:D on days 1\u20138 post IAV infection was very similar between all\nfour groups, though IAV infected BMAL1 KO mice had greater variability in period\nrelative to the other treatment groups (Fig. 2e). Analysis\nof behavior as a function of daily distribution (day vs. night) emphasizes\ntreatment and genotype specific effects (Supplementary Fig.\n4a\u2013d). As expected, WT-saline treated mice were mostly\nactive during the dark phase (ZT12-24; 70\u201380% of total activity)\nwhile BMAL1 KO-saline treated mice appeared to be arrhythmic and displayed a\nmore even distribution of activity, though levels were still slightly higher at\nnight (Supplementary Fig. 4a\u2013b). IAV infection\naltered the normal distribution of daily activity in both WT and BMAL1 KO mice,\nthough the effects were clearly more dramatic in WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 4c-d). WT mice infected with IAV increased their\ndaytime activity but reduced their nighttime activity, producing apparent\narrhythmia marked by a near equal distribution of activity across the 24h day\n(50% light; 50% dark). This effect of IAV infection on daily activity was less\npronounced in BMAL1 KO mice, due largely to the fact that these mice already\ndisplayed a more equal distribution of daily activity/arrhythmia. That said,\nwithin 2 days of infection mean activity was actually higher in BMAL1 KO mice\nduring the light phase, suggesting a brief period of diurnal preference\nfollowing IAV infection (Supplementary Fig. 4d). This effect\nwas diminished by day 3\u20134 post-infection with mice becoming more\nactive during the night 5\u20139 days post-infection in parallel with\nincreased mortality. These data reveal that, though BMAL1 KO mice differ from WT\nmice in terms of activity distribution prior to infection (most likely due to\nentrainment deficits in KO mice) both strains show reduced nocturnal preference\nfollowing IAV infection.\n\nWe have previously reported that core clock genes (bmal1, clock, per1-2,\ncry1-2, rev-erb\u03b1) were rhythmically expressed in the lung of\nair- and CS-exposed mice both during acute and chronic CS exposure30. Of the known core clock genes, only ror\u03b1 gene\nexpression was not rhythmic in lungs of chronic air- and CS-exposed mice30. The peaks of gene expression rhythms for most clock genes in\nair-exposed controls were similar to those previously reported3031. In both the chronic air- and CS-exposed mice, the\nexpression of bmal1, clock, and cry1 displayed nocturnal\nacrophases, peaking during the mid to late portion of the dark phase (ZT18-24;\nZT0 = lights on: ZT12 = lights off)30. As anticipated, both\nchronic air- and CS-exposed mice showed peaks of per1, per2, cry2,\nrev-erb\u03b1, and rev-erb\u03b2 antiphase to\nbmal1 (between ZT6-ZT12)30. Chronic CS-exposed mice\nshowed a modest reduction in the amplitude of bmal1 and\nrev-erb\u03b1 expression and substantially reduced amplitude of\nper1 expression30. Analysis of clock gene expression 9\ndays after IAV infection in air-exposed mice (Air+Virus) revealed significant\nrhythms of bmal1 (P < 0.001), per1, per2, cry1\nand rev-erb\u03b2 (P < 0.05) but not clock,\ncry2, rev-erb\u03b1 and ror\u03b1 in lung tissue\n(Fig. 3a\u2013b, Supplementary\nFig. 5 and Table 1). Mice exposed to chronic CS and IAV infection\n(CS+Virus) only displayed rhythms of bmal1 (P < 0.01)\nand per1 (P < 0.05) expression in the lungs (Fig. 3a\u2013b, Supplementary Fig. 5 and\nTable 1). Previously reported data from air-exposed mice are shown\nhere for comparison (Fig. 3a\u2013b, Supplementary Fig. 5 and Table 1). In Air+Virus infected mice, the\npeak expression of bmal1, per1, per2, cry1, cry2, and\nrev-erb\u03b2 shifted to the middle of the light phase (ZT6;\nZT0 = lights on; ZT12 = lights off) and the amplitude of gene expression was\naltered at ZT6 when compared to air-exposed controls and chronic CS+Virus group\n(Fig. 3a\u2013b, Supplementary\nFig. 5a-b). As in Air+Virus treated mice, expression of bmal1,\nclock and rev-erb\u03b2 was shifted to peak at mid-day\n(ZT6) in CS+Virus exposed mice (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 5b). However, unlike Air+Virus treated mice, the\nphase of peak per1 and cry2 expression returned to ZT12 and the\nremaining clock genes [per2, cry1, rev-erb\u03b1 and\nror\u03b1] peaked at middle of dark phase (ZT18).\nTogether, these data support the notion that IAV induces circadian disruption in\nthe lungs, though the effects appear to be somewhat attenuated in mice exposed\nto chronic CS (Fig. 3a\u2013b and Supplementary Fig. 5a\u2013b).\n\nWe also determined the effects of CS with or without IAV infection on the\nexpression of CCGs including sirt1, ahr and muc5ac in the lungs (Supplementary Fig. 5c\u2013d). We have previously\ndetected a circadian rhythm of sirt1 expression that was altered by acute\nexposure to CS30. Herein we observed daily fluctuation of all\nthree CCGs but only ahr rhythmicity was confirmed by CircWave analysis\n(P < 0.05). Though not statistically rhythmic in the\nair-exposed lungs, CircWave analysis did confirm significant rhythms of\nsirt1 (P < 0.05) in the Air+Virus group that was\nattenuated by previous exposure to CS (Supplementary Fig. 5c-d and\nTable 1). Further, we detected a shift in peak sirt1 and\nahr expression from the latter portion of the dark phase (ZT18) in\nthe air-exposed group to mid-day (ZT6) in both the Air+Virus and CS+Virus groups\n(Supplementary Fig. 5d). In addition to these phase\nshifts, there was an apparent increase in the amplitude of sirt1\nexpression following IAV infection (Supplementary Fig. 5c).\nAccording to CircWave analyses muc5ac was not rhythmically expressed in\nlung tissue regardless of treatment (Supplementary Fig.\n5c).\n\nThe effect of acute CS exposure combined with or without IAV infection on clock\ngene expression in the lung was confirmed by real-time monitoring of PER2::LUC\nexpression in lung tissue explant cultures. Exposure to 0.1% cigarette smoke\nextract (CSE) in vitro produced a modest reduction in the amplitude and\nslight increase in the period of PER2::LUC expression in lung tissue explants in\nagreement with our previous report30. Viral infection (300\nHAU/ml) also significantly reduced the amplitude and increased the period of\nPER2::LUC expression in lung explants (Fig. 3c). We\nobserved comparable effects of 0.1% CSE+Virus similar to 0.1% CSE treatment\nalone in the amplitude and period of PER2::LUC expression in lung tissue\nexplants (Fig. 3c). There was a significant reduction in\nthe period of PER2::LUC expression in lung tissue explants treated with 0.1%\nCSE+Virus compared to IAV infection alone (Fig. 3c).\nOverall, CSE+Virus and IAV infection alone both reduced the amplitude and\ndifferentially affected the period of PER2::LUC expression in lung tissue\nexplants.\n\nAs previously reported, similar levels of virus-specific antibodies were present\nin the blood of both Air+Virus and CS+Virus infected mice32. To\ninvestigate whether IAV infection after chronic CS exposure alters the\ninflammatory status in mouse lung, we measured the number of leukocytes in lung\nbronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid 9 days post-infection. We observed more total\ncells, macrophages and lymphocytes near the end of the dark phase (ZT24) in the\nCS+Virus group when compared to Air+Virus, air- and CS-exposed mice (Fig. 4a\u2013c). There was also a significant increase\nin neutrophils at ZT24 in chronic CS-exposed mice compared to air-exposed\ncontrol. That is, in the absence of infection, there was an increase in\nneutrophils; however, this was not observed on day 9 of infection (Fig. 4d).\n\nWe next determined the impact of chronic CS exposure followed by IAV infection on\nrhythms of proinflammatory cytokine release in BAL fluid. MCP-1, IL-6 and MIP-2\nlevels were measured in BAL fluid at day 9 post-infection across the 24h day.\nThe CS+Virus group showed significant increases in the expression of MCP-1 at\nZT6 and ZT24 when compared to Air+Virus and air-exposed controls (Fig. 4e). We observed a significant decline in the levels of\nproinflammatory cytokines MIP-2 at ZT0 and ZT12 and IL-6 at ZT12 in the\nAir+Virus and CS+Virus groups 9 days post-infection compared to uninfected\nCS-exposed mice (Fig. 4f\u2013g). Chronic CS-exposed\nmice showed significant increases in the levels of IL-6 and MIP-2 that peaked at\nZT12 compared to air-exposed controls (Fig.\n4f\u2013g). Overall, IAV infection dampened the total number of\nneutrophils, MIP-2 and IL-6 levels, while it increased the total number of\nmacrophages, lymphocytes and MCP-1 levels by day 9 post-infection. CircWave\nanalysis confirmed significant diurnal rhythms of both IL-6 and MIP-2 levels in\nBAL fluid from chronic CS-exposed mice (P < 0.01). In\ncontrast, chronic air-exposed, Air+Virus and CS+Virus groups did not show\nrhythmic expression of MCP-1, IL-6 and MIP-2 in BAL fluid as confirmed by\nCircWave analysis. The increase in levels of cytokines that we observed on day 9\npost-infection was associated with influx of inflammatory cells in the lung in\nCS+Virus and chronic CS-exposed mice (Fig. 4a\u2013g\nand Supplementary Fig. 6a-d).\n\nWe have also analyzed proinflammatory cytokine release in BAL fluid by pooling\ntime points according to photoperiod (ZT6+ZT12 = daytime and ZT18+24 =\nnighttime) for MCP-1, MIP-2, IL-6 and TGF-\u03b21. Chronic CS-exposed mice\nshowed a significant increase in the levels of MIP-2, IL-6 at ZT6+ZT12 (daytime)\nand TGF-\u03b21 at ZT18+ZT24 (nighttime) compared to controls (Supplementary Fig. 6a\u2013d). Chronic CS-exposed mice\ninfected with IAV showed a significant increase in the level of MCP-1 both at\nZT6+ZT12 (daytime) and ZT18+ZT24 (nighttime). The levels of other cytokines\nincluding MIP-2, IL-6 and TGF-\u03b21 were significantly reduced in\nCS+Virus group compared to CS-exposed mice at ZT6+ZT12 (Supplementary Fig. 6a-d). Thus, our data show that disruption of\ncircadian clock function in the lung was associated with augmented MCP-1 levels\nduring IAV-induced exacerbation in chronic CS-exposed mice.\n\nTo further examine the role of circadian regulatory factors on host responses to\ninfection, we determined the total number of leukocytes in the airways.\nConsistent with prior reports, there was a significant increase in total cells,\nmacrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils in BAL fluid from WT-Virus infected\nmice compared to WT-Saline treated mice (Supplementary Fig.\n7a\u2013d). However, we were unable to evaluate immune cells in\nlungs of infected BMAL1 KO mice due to 100% mortality in this group by day-9\npost-infection (see Fig. 2b). Because we observed a\nsignificant increase in inflammatory cellular influx into the lung of IAV\ninfected WT mice, we next determined the level of proinflammatory\ncytokines/chemokines in BAL fluid. WT-Virus infected mice showed a significant\nincrease in release of proinflammatory mediators such as IL-6, MCP-1, IP-10, KC,\nIL-10, and TNF\u03b1 when compared to WT-Saline treated mice (Supplementary Fig. 8). The change in the lung proinflammatory\nmediators in BAL fluid observed at day 9 post-infection was correlated with\ninflux of inflammatory cells in the lung (Supplementary Fig. 7a-d\nand Supplementary Fig. 8). Thus, our data show correlation of\nalteration in inflammatory cells in the lung with augmented pro-inflammatory\ncytokine responses during IAV infection in vivo.\n\nChronic CS exposure enhanced IAV induced inflammatory responses, as observed by\nincreases in peribronchial and perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration in\nthe airways (Fig. 5a). Mucus hypersecretion in the airways\nis an important characteristic pathological feature during acute exacerbation of\nCOPD and is a key facet of inflammation-induced airway obstruction33. We determined the degree of mucus production in the airways of\nAir+Virus and CS+Virus infected mice at day 9 post-infection. Mucus-producing\nPAS positive cells were significantly increased in airway epithelium of chronic\nCS+Virus infected mice compared to Air+Virus infected mice that displayed a\npaucity of mucus producing cells in the airway epithelium (Fig.\n5b). Trichrome staining demonstrated significant increases in airway\nfibrosis in mice exposed to CS+Virus with increase in collagen deposition\nobserved around the airways (Fig. 5c). Further, we\ndetected a significant increase in \u03b1-SMA levels, a marker for\nactivated myofibroblasts observed in fibrotic lung disease, in the fibrotic\nregions of the lung from both air and CS-exposed mice infected with IAV (Supplementary Fig. 9a). These characteristic features suggest\nthat IAV infection of mice previously exposed to chronic CS results in\nexaggerated lung inflammation and fibrotic airway remodeling in vivo. It\nhas been documented that after IAV infection, epithelial damage induced by the\nvirus could be repaired in order to completely restore lung structure and\nfunction in vivo. Clara cell specific marker, CCSP was used to identify\nchanges that occur during virus infection in the airway bronchial epithelial\ncell population. At day 9 post-infection, we observed a significant decrease in\nthe expression of CCSP positive cells in the airway bronchial epithelium of\nchronic CS+Virus infected mice compared to Air+Virus, air- and CS-exposed mice\n(Supplementary Fig. 9a).\n\nTo investigate the role of IAV-induced circadian clock disruption of the lungs\nand the possible impact on lung airway remodeling and pulmonary function, we\nexamined airspace enlargement/emphysema by lung histopathologic and functional\nmeasurements in chronic CS+Virus infected mice. There was a significant\ndifference in lung histopathological changes between chronic CS+Virus infected\nmice and Air+Virus infected mice 9 days post-infection, which was confirmed with\nmeasurements of the mean linear intercept (MLI; Air+Virus 43.27 \u00b1\n3.31 vs. CS+Virus 62.27 \u00b1 3.20; P < 0.001; Supplementary Fig. 9b). These data suggest that IAV infection\nand chronic CS exposure can synergistically enhance airway remodeling in\nmice.\n\nWe then determined the impact of IAV infection on diurnal rhythms of lung\nfunction, including lung compliance, resistance and tissue elastance. We have\npreviously reported that when examined as a function of time of day (day vs.\nnight) chronic CS-exposed mice show significantly increased lung compliance and\nreduced elastance, but resistance is not significantly reduced30.\nWhen analyzed at specific time points across the day, elastance and resistance\nwere only significantly reduced at ZT18 in chronic CS-exposed mice30. Lung compliance was significantly decreased at ZT12 and ZT24 in\nthe CS+Virus group when compared to the Air+Virus group (Fig.\n6a\u2013b; Tables 2\u20133 and Supplementary Tables\n1\u20133). There was a change in the phase and rhythms of lung\ncompliance in Air+Virus group when compared to air-exposed and chronic CS+Virus\ninfected mice (Fig. 6a\u2013b; Tables 2\u20133 and Supplementary Tables 1\u20133). However, lung resistance\ndecreased significantly only at ZT6 in CS+Virus group as compared to Air+Virus\ngroup (Fig. 6a\u2013b; Tables\n2\u20133 and Supplementary Tables 1\u20133). Tissue elastance was\nsignificantly decreased at ZT6 and significantly increased at ZT24 in the\nCS+Virus group when compared to the Air+Virus group (Fig.\n6a\u2013b; Tables 2\u20133 and Supplementary Tables\n1\u20133). Similarly, there were significant alterations in the\nphase and amplitude of lung resistance and tissue elastance rhythms in CS+Virus\ngroup and Air+Virus group when compared to air-exposed controls (Fig. 6a\u2013b; Table\n2\u20133 and Supplementary Tables 1\u20133). Overall, when we combined the\ndata from day (ZT6 and ZT24) and night (ZT12 and ZT18), lung compliance was\nsignificantly reduced whereas lung resistance and tissue elastance significantly\nincreased during the dark phase (ZT12-18) in CS+Virus group compared to\nAir+Virus group (Fig. 6a\u2013b; Tables 2\u20133 and Supplementary Tables 1\u20133). Thus, IAV infection appeared to\ninvert the phase of peak tissue elastance and resistance but not lung compliance\nsuch that each marker of pulmonary function peaked during the light phase (when\nthe animal is generally sleeping; Fig. 6b). Exposure to CS\nprior to IAV appeared to oppose this response, preventing the dramatic shifts\nproduced by IAV infection.\n\nTo investigate the role of the molecular clock in the response to IAV infection,\nwe measured lung compliance, resistance and tissue elastance in WT mice infected\nwith IAV on day 9 post-infection, uninfected BMAL1 heterozygous KO mice and\nuninfected homozygous BMAL1 KO mice. Lung compliance was significantly decreased\nin both WT-Virus and BMAL1 KO-Saline treated mice compared to WT-Saline and\nBMAL1 Het-Saline treated mice (Fig. 6c). However, lung\nresistance and tissue elastance were significantly increased in both WT-Virus\nand BMAL1 KO-Saline treated mice (Fig. 6c). BMAL1\nKO-Saline treated mice displayed a significant increase in lung compliance and\ndecrease in resistance and elastance when compared to WT-Virus infected mice\nsuggesting an inherent defect in the lung mechanical properties of BMAL1 KO mice\nin the absence of infection (Fig. 6c). In a separate\nexperiment, we determined lung function at different ZT (ZT0-ZT18; n = 1 mice/\nZT time point) in 2\u20133 months old BMAL1 KO mice and WT littermates. We\nalso performed differential cell counts in BAL fluid collected from WT and BMAL1\nKO mice at all the four ZT time points. We averaged the cell counts data from\ndifferent time points and found that Bmal1 KO mice had a significant increase in\nneutrophil counts compared to WT littermates (Supplementary Fig.\n10a). Total cell counts and macrophage counts were not significantly\ndifferent between BMAL1 KO and WT littermates (Supplementary Fig.\n10a).\n\nWe measured the rhythms of lung mechanical properties in BMAL1 KO and WT\nlittermates at different ZT time points. BMAL1 KO mice showed similar peaks of\nlung function measurements as air-exposed controls but each was significantly\naltered (reduced compliance, increased resistance and elastance) compared to WT\nlittermates (Supplementary Fig. 10b). We found that BMAL1 KO\nmice develop spontaneous pro-fibrotic lung phenotype as they age when compared\nto WT littermates (Supplementary Fig. 10c). The development\nof a fibrotic-like phenotype in BMAL1 KO mice could contribute to the altered\nlung function we observed in these mice (Fig. 6c). Thus,\nour data suggest that the clock gene activator BMAL1 may play an essential role\nin maintaining normal pulmonary function. Influenza A virus infection in BMAL1\nKO mice further enhance the severity of virus infection resulting in increased\nmorbidity and mortality.\n\nPatients with COPD display daily rhythms of symptom exacerbation affiliated with\nsleep disruption343536. Given the daily nature of these\nexacerbations and their impact on sleep quality, we hypothesized that disruption of\nthe biological timing system occurs during the etiology of COPD. We have previously\nreported that rhythms of behavior (locomotor activity), hormone secretion (serotonin\nand corticosterone) and clock gene expression in the lungs and brain are altered in\na mouse model of COPD due to environmental tobacco/cigarette smoke exposure3037. Influenza infection is also known to alter behavior3839 and has a negative influence on lung function29.\nThe immune-inflammatory system is regulated by the circadian clock at multiple\nlevels with immune and inflammatory responses showing robust daily oscillations2021. Though limited evidence suggests that IAV infection alters\nsleep patterns via targeted effects on gene expression in particular hypothalamic\nsleep centers40, it has yet to be determined if IAV infection alters\ncircadian clock function directly in the lungs or affects daily rhythms of lung\nfunction. Further, the potential for exacerbation of COPD impacts on clock function\ndue to IAV infection has not been determined. Using a mouse model of COPD, we have\ndetermined the impact of IAV infection alone or IAV infection comorbid with COPD on\nclock function in the lungs, activity levels, inflammatory/injurious lung responses\nand daily rhythms of lung function. To address the role of the clock during COPD\nand/or infection, we carried out these experiments in bmal1 knockout mice\nthat lack a functioning oscillator. We demonstrate that IAV infection further\nexacerbates the effects of COPD on clock function in the lungs and daily rhythms of\nbehavior. Further, our data reveal a potentially critical role for the circadian\nclock in mitigating a normal immune response to IAV infection.\n\nPatients with COPD have poor sleep quality, increased sleep latency, decreased total\nsleep time, increased waking after sleep onset and decreased non-REM and REM sleep\nepisodes36. These individuals are also commonly diagnosed with\nsleep disorders including obstructive sleep apnea41. Psychological\ndistress in those with COPD is associated with a decline in lung function, increased\nexacerbation frequency and worsening of cardiovascular disease, further disrupting\nsleep in these patients34. Though our experiments did not directly\nmeasure sleep per se (e.g. using polysomnographic recording), the\nconsiderable reduction in activity during the day and night in both WT and BMAL1 KO\nmice following IAV infection implies adaptive changes in the homeostatic or\ncircadian sleep drive that lead to increased inactivity during IAV infection. This\nincrease in sleep/reduced activity level could be as a result of immune/inflammatory\ncell infiltration (e.g. macrophages) that can generate influenza-induced sleep\nenhancement38. Alternative compensatory immune mechanisms that\ngenerate an effective host defense response may also contribute to sleep propensity\nduring viral infection38. It has been suggested that altered\nexpression of Temt (thioether-S-methyltransferase) in the hypothalamus and\nbasal forebrain during IAV infection may influence sleep patterns through its\neffects on prostaglandin metabolism42.\n\nWe show for the first time that IAV infection alters circadian clock gene expression\nin the lungs and reduces the amplitude of locomotor activity in a COPD/emphysema\nmouse model. The effect of IAV infection persisted longer (post-infection day\n7\u20139) in chronic CS-exposed mice, coincident with a decrease in body\nweight and increased mortality. BMAL1 KO mice infected with IAV also displayed a\nsignificant decline in body weight and survival (100% mortality), suggesting that\nproper function of the timing system is necessary for maintaining the innate immune\nresponse to infection. Chronic air- and CS-exposed mice infected with IAV after 6\nmonths of exposure and WT and BMAL1 KO mice infected with IAV show widely varying\nchanges in morbidity (weight) and mortality. This could be due to strain background-\nand age-dependent effects of IAV infection. The mice were 2\u20133 months old\nwhen we started the chronic air and CS exposure. At the end of chronic air and CS\nexposure (6 months) and before IAV infection chronic air- and CS-exposed mice were\nabout 9\u201310 months old. Similarly, WT littermates and BMAL1 KO mice were\n2\u20134 months old when they were infected with IAV. Hence, we speculate the\ntwo confounding factors such as strain background and age of these mice when they\nwere infected with IAV play an essential role on the severity of IAV on the loss of\nbody weight and mortality in vivo. This notion is supported by studies\nwherein circadian desynchronization due to experimental jet-lag increased\ninflammatory responses and mortality following LPS challenge43. It is\nevident that changes in the phase and amplitude of clock gene expression in the\nlungs are affiliated with impaired lung function (compliance, resistance and tissue\nelastance). Analysis of lung function rhythms clearly revealed a near inversion of\npeak phase rhythms of lung function in Air+Virus group compared to air-exposed mice.\nThough generally similar, prior exposure to CS (COPD) did not fully attenuate the\neffects of IAV infection, as there were still slight differences in peak lung\nfunctions in these mice. These changes in lung function rhythms may underlie the\nreduced activity and increased mortality observed among IAV infected mice.\n\nTo assess the impact of IAV with or without CS exposure more directly, we examined\nthe influence of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) and influenza A virus\n(300 HAU/ml) on PER2::LUC expression in lung tissue explants. As reported\nearlier, CSE treatment at a very low dose (0.1%) tended to lengthen the period of\nPER2::LUC expression in lung tissue explants, though the effect was modest.\nInfection with IAV resulted in a significant increase in period when compared to\nuninfected controls. Surprisingly, CSE treatment combined with IAV infection\nattenuated the effect of IAV infection alone on the period but not the amplitude of\nPER2::LUC expression in lung explants. Circadian disruption due to chronic jet lag\nhas been shown to alter lung mechanics and clock gene expression in the lungs in a\nsexually dimorphic manner44. As a whole these data strongly suggest\nthat CS exposure and virus infection either alone or in combination can affect clock\nfunction in the lungs. CS combined with IAV infection affects both lung CCGs and\npulmonary function akin to other models of circadian disruption, suggesting that\neven a subtle change in clock function may have significant impact on\nclock-dependent physiological processes in both the lungs and immune system1620214546. Though implied, direct support for a functional\nlink between rhythms of lung function and circadian clock gene expression in the\nlungs remains elusive. While not conclusive evidence for such a link, the combined\nand somewhat parallel impacts of IAV infection on pulmonary function and clock gene\nexpression in the lungs support the notion that the lung clock contributes in a\nmeaningful way to the timing of pulmonary physiology.\n\nIt is well known that immune-inflammatory parameters change with time of day and\ndisruption of circadian rhythms has been associated with infectious and inflammatory\ndiseases202145. Studies from animal models highlight the\nextent to which the core clock proteins (BMAL1, CLOCK and REV-ERB\u03b1)\nregulate fundamental aspects of the immune-inflammatory response21,\nsuch as toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)46 and repressing chemokine (C-C\nmotif) ligand 2 (CCL2) expression47. Further, REV-ERB\u03b1 has\nbeen shown to attenuate the activation of IL-6 expression1947. It\nhas been shown that the core circadian clock protein was bound to nuclear factor\nkappa B (NF-\u03baB) RelA/p65 activating NF-\u03baB-dependent\ntranscription48. Both transcription factors activator protein 1\n(AP-1) and NF-\u03baB share unique sequences that overlaps consensus sequence\nfrom rev-erb\u03b1 promoters demonstrating role of REV-ERB\u03b1\nin regulating oxidative stress and/or inflammation49. These reports\nsuggest involvement of these proinflammatory gene regulatory transcription factors\nand role of molecular clock on exaggerated inflammatory responses observed in our\nmouse model of COPD.\n\nBMAL1 KO mice are behaviorally arrhythmic50 and show signs of advanced\naging and underlying pathologies, correlated with increased levels of ROS and\ncellular senescence5152. We have recently shown that CS exposure\nreduced mRNA and protein levels of BMAL1 and BMAL1-CC10 cre (epithelium specific\nBmal1 KO) with augmented inflammatory responses and dysregulation of CS-induced\noxidative stress. These data suggest the involvement of the molecular clock in\nregulation of CS-induced lung inflammation30, which supports previous\nwork indicating that BMAL1 has an anti-inflammatory function1953.\nRecently, Clock\u039419 circadian mutant mouse lung showed\naltered temporal Nrf2 activity complemented with reduced GSH levels, increased\nprotein oxidation and a spontaneous fibrotic-like phenotype54. We\nfound that BMAL1 KO mice also develop a pro-fibrotic phenotype in the lung which\ncould be due to increased ROS levels and altered oxidative stress-mediated cellular\nsenescence5152. BMAL1 deletion in myeloid cells demonstrated\ndiurnal variation in the absolute number of specific monocytes\n(Ly6Chi) in blood and in the spleen under normal conditions which\nwas enhanced during inflamed peritoneum at ZT8 versus ZT053. This\nstudy also revealed that BMAL1 binds to E-boxes in the promoters of Ccl2,\nCcl8 and S100a8 (encoding S100 calcium binding protein A8) and\nrecruits with it members of the polycomb repressor complex (PRC2) thereby allowing\nrepressive histone marks to block transcription and attenuate Ly6Chi\nmonocyte numbers and inflammation at the site of damage53. It has\nbeen shown that the number of leukocytes in the mouse circulation strongly\ncorrelates with circadian variability, such that leukocyte numbers peak at ZT5 and\nrecruitment into the tissues peaks at ZT1317. Keller et al.\ndemonstrated that the role of entire toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway in\nperitoneal macrophages is tightly regulated under the control of circadian clock and\nthus equip the immune cell to face exaggerated response at times18.\nIn the present study, analysis of clock gene expression revealed a significant\nimpact of IAV infection on the expression of core clock genes. There was also a time\nof day-dependent increase in the number of total cells, macrophage counts and\nlymphocyte counts following IAV infection of CS-exposed mice. In the present study,\nthe total numbers of inflammatory cells were significantly increased at ZT24 when\ncompared to ZT0 though they represent the same circadian phase. Previous reports\nsuggest that inflammatory cells in the lungs were significantly increased in BAL\nfluid of mice euthanized 24 h after the last exposure compared to 2 h post-last CS\nexposure5556. These findings suggests that CS exposure has a\nsuppressive effect on the number of inflammatory cells recovered in the lavage,\npossibly due to capillary trapping or increased adhesion, which causes reduction in\nthe numbers recovered from the air spaces at ZT0 compared to ZT24. This finding is\nsupported by increased proinflammatory mediators released into the lung at 24 h\ncompared to 2 h after the last CS exposure, which would attract more inflammatory\ncells into the lung interstitium during CS exposure.\n\nThe proinflammatory cytokine MCP-1 response was also greater in the IAV infected mice\nexposed to CS. Similarly, chronic CS exposure also increased MIP-2 and IL-6 at\nZT6/12 when compared to controls. However, IL-6 and MIP-2 levels were dampened in CS\nplus Virus group which could be due to immunosuppressive effects of CS which is in\nline with recent report in which CS exposure suppressed the production of cytokines\nand chemokines after pandemic H1N1 or avian H9N2 virus infection in mice57. It has been shown that the IAV-mediated inflammatory response\nbegins early on day 3 and remains high until day 5\u20137 post-infection58. Subsequently, viral clearance occurs by day 10 in the lungs,\nthereby resolving the inflammatory phenotype, such as inflammatory cellular influx\nand proinflammatory mediators release observed during IAV infection in\nvivo58. Hence, we did not observe significant increases in\npro-inflammatory mediators at day 9 post IAV infection in chronic air- and\nCS-exposed mice. CS-exposed mice infected with IAV showed sign of severe pulmonary\ninflammation, lung permeability damage and mucus hypersecretion which are\ncharacteristic features of acute exacerbation of COPD5960. We have\npreviously reported that mainstream CS exposure at a concentration of\n300 mg/m3 (TPM) for 8 weeks causes significant\nincrease in PAS positive cells in mouse lungs61. In this study, we\nused a low dose side-stream smoke exposure\n(~90\u2013100 mg/m3) for 6 months, that unlike\nmainstream smoke, does not cause mucus production in the chronic CS-exposed mouse\nlungs when compared to Air+Virus and CS+Virus groups. A recent study identified a\nregulatory mechanism, whereby the lung epithelial clock and glucocorticoid hormones\ncontrol both time-of-day variation and magnitude of pulmonary inflammatory responses\nto bacterial infection62. Similarly, rhythms of pulmonary function\ndefine time-of-day dependent sensitivity to steroids and \u03b22-agonists in\npatients with nocturnal asthma and asthmatics who smoke636465.\nHence, it is possible that the mechanism that couples the circadian clock and\nbronchiolar glucocorticoid receptor to pulmonary innate immunity plays an essential\nrole during COPD exacerbations by IAV infection. These data suggest that temporal\nincreases in chemoattractants, leukocyte trafficking, proinflammatory\ncytokines/chemokines, and phagocytic ability before the activity phase is indicative\nof clock-controlled sensitivity and immunosurveillance. Collectively, these data\nsuggest that the molecular clock and associated transcription factors, epigenetic\nregulators, and key regulatory signaling pathways play an essential role in cytokine\ngene expression through temporal gating of immune responses.\n\nSeveral studies have examined the effects of acute CS exposure combined with IAV\ninfection5866676869. Only two prior reports determined\nthe effects of IAV infection combined with chronic CS exposure model7071. Robbins et al. were the first to show chronic CS affects\nprimary antiviral immune-inflammatory responses, yet secondary immune protection\nremained intact suggesting exaggerated inflammatory responses during viral infection\nmight possibly influence decline in clinical status associated with COPD\nexacerbations70. Wortham et al. demonstrated NKG2D\nstimulation during chronic CS exposure plays an essential role in the development of\nNK cell hyper-responsiveness and influenza-mediated exacerbations of COPD71. Based on the published studies, it is evident that both acute and\nchronic CS exposure combined with influenza infection causes increased pulmonary and\nsystemic inflammation in vivo which was accompanied by increased viral\nproliferation or reduced clearance5867. In this study, the dynamics\nof viral proliferation were not affected; instead we observed an exaggerated\ninflammatory response and apparent normalization of lung function rhythms in chronic\nCS-exposed mice infected with IAV. The discrepancies observed in previous studies\ninclude CS exposure protocols, dose and duration of CS exposure (acute vs. chronic),\nviral dose (low and high) used, time of virus infection (ZT0-24) and duration\npost-infection of analyses. Regardless of these discrepancies, these studies support\nthe fact that CS-induced inflammation plays a defining role in the initial\ninflammatory responses to IAV infection in the lungs. It is possible that\nIAV-mediated resetting of clock function in the lungs may influence the survival of\nmice previously exposed to chronic CS. The re-alignment of many of the clock genes\nfollowing IAV infection may represent transient\n\u2018sensitization\u2019 of the timing system to an acute inflammatory\nmediator1272. It is worth noting that, outside of\nror\u03b1, only those clock genes associated with the repressive function of\nthe clock (per1,2 and cry1,2) were in effect \u2018phase-reset\u2019 by\nIAV. This suggests a disparate influence of IAV infection on the oscillator, a\nphenomenon reported previously in response to dual entrainment by multiple cues in\nthe liver73.\n\nIn conclusion, we show for the first time that IAV infection can cause temporally\ngated circadian disruption associated with exaggerated lung inflammation and\ninjurious response in the lungs, culminating in exacerbations of COPD/emphysema. Our\nin vivo model of COPD exacerbation clearly demonstrates how changes in\nmolecular clock function and immune responses can affect morbidity and mortality,\nrhythms of locomotor activity, lung inflammation and small airway remodeling. The\nrole of the clock gene BMAL1 in COPD exacerbation was tested using the IAV infection\nmodel. Overall, our findings clearly show that the circadian clock plays a crucial\nrole in modulating immune-inflammatory response during viral respiratory infection\nin mice. The COPD exacerbation mouse model develops augmented inflammatory responses\nand lung damage due to involvement of clock-dependent mechanisms that in turn affect\nimmune response and rhythms of lung function. Understanding molecular clock function\nand its physiological significance in different animal models of chronic lung\ndisease, including our COPD exacerbation model, could hasten the development of\nnovel chronotherapeutic approaches for the treatment and management of COPD and\nassociated exacerbations.\n\nMale C57BL/6J (C57) and BMAL1 knockout (KO: B6.129-Arntltm1Bra/J)\nmice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). C57BL/6J and\nBMAL1 KO mice were housed under a 12:12 light-dark (LD) cycle with lights on at\n6 a.m. and fed with a regular diet and water ad libitum unless otherwise\nindicated. For chronic (6 months) CS exposure, mice were kept in a standard\n12:12 L:D cycle with lights on from 6 am-6 pm throughout the experiment. Data\nfrom animals exposed to air/CS for 6 months from a previous study were included\nhere for comparison30.\n\nEight week-old mice were used for tobacco/CS exposure as previously\ndescribed307475. We used chronic (6 mo. exposure which\ncauses pulmonary emphysema) CS exposure mouse models to determine the effect and\nmechanism of chronic CS exposure followed by influenza virus infection on\ncircadian clock function and lung inflammation. Mice were exposed to CS using an\nenvironmental side-stream delivering Teague TE-10 smoking machine (Teague\nEnterprises, Davis, CA) for 6 months CS exposure in the Inhalation Facility at\nthe University of Rochester Medical Center. The smoke was generated from 3R4F\nresearch cigarettes containing 11.0 mg of total particulate matter\n(TPM), 9.4 mg of tar and 0.73 mg of nicotine per cigarette\n(University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY). The total particulate matter (TPM) in\nper cubic meter of air in exposure chamber was monitored in real-time with a\nMicroDust Pro-aerosol monitor (Casella CEL, Bedford, UK), and verified daily by\ngravimetric sampling307475. Control mice were exposed to\nfiltered air in an identical chamber according to the same protocol described\nfor CS exposure. For chronic 6 months CS exposures, 3R4F cigarettes were used to\ngenerate a mixture of sidestream smoke (89%) and mainstream smoke (11%) at a\nconcentration of ~100 mg/m3 TPM, so as to avoid the\npossible toxicity to mice at a high concentration of long-term CS exposure3074 according to the Federal Trade Commission protocol\n(1 puff/min of 2 second duration and 35 ml volume). Each\nsmoldering cigarette was puffed for 2 seconds, once every minute for a total of\n5 puffs, at a flow rate of 1.05 L/min, to provide a standard puff of\n35 cm3. Mice received 5-hour exposures per day, 5\ndays/week for the duration of exposure and were sacrificed at 6-hour intervals\n24h after the last CS exposure.\n\nAfter 6 months chronic Air/CS exposure, mice were intranasally infected under\nanesthesia (Avertin; 2,2,2-tribromoethanol; Sigma-Aldrich) with 120\nhemagglutination units (HAU) of influenza A virus (IAV), strain HKx31 (x31;\nH3N2) in 25 \u00b5l sterile PBS as previously described3276. Mock-infected control group mice received\n25 \u00b5l of sterile PBS alone. After infection, survival and\nbody weight of all the experimental groups were monitored and recorded daily\nuntil post-infection day 9. Mice were euthanized post-infection day 9 at 6 hour\nintervals for 24 hours (5 time points: ZT0, ZT6, ZT12, ZT18 and ZT24). The 6-hr\nsampling interval was based on prior studies on circadian gene expression in\nmice3037. Schematic for chronic CS exposure combined with\nIAV infection and IAV infection in BMAL1 KO and wild-type littermates including\nparameters measured from these experiments are included in the Supporting\ninformation (see Supplementary Fig. 1a-b).\n\nMice were individually housed and allowed free access to food and water.\nLocomotor activity was measured using the Photobeam Activity System (San Diego\nInstruments, San Diego, CA), a computerized system that measures the frequency\nof photobeam breaks along the side of the cage. Total cage activity (photobeam\nbreak) activity was recorded in 1-min intervals and analyzed using ClockLab\nsoftware (Actimetrics, Evanston IL) as previously described30.\nCircadian periodicity of locomotor activity in L:D was calculated during days\n1-8 post IAV infection with a \u03c72 periodogram analysis\n(tau range 20\u201328 h).\n\nAdult male Period2::luciferase knock-in (PER2::LUC) mice77 were\neuthanized three hours before lights-off (Zeitgeber Time 9\u201312, lights\noff = ZT12) by excess CO2 exposure. Portions of the lung were removed\nand collected in cold sterile Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS). Small\n5 mm3 fragments of lung tissue were isolated. Lung\ntissues were placed in 35mm culture dishes with 1.2 ml of culture\nmedium [DMEM supplemented with B27 (Gibco), 10 mM HEPES,\n352.5 \u03bcg/ml NaHCO3, 3.5 mg/ml D- glucose,\n25 U/ml penicillin, 25 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin and\n0.1 mM luciferin (Promega)]. Cultures were prepared with\nclean media as described above (control) or the same media containing cigarette\nsmoke extract (CSE 0.1%), media containing 300 HAU influenza A virus ( and\nsealed with sterile vacuum grease and a glass coverslip. Sealed cultures were\nmaintained at 35 \u00b0C in a light-tight incubator and luminescence was\ncontinuously recorded (counts/sec) with an automated luminometer (LumiCycle,\nActimetrics). Raw luminescence data were detrended (24 h moving average) and\nsmoothed (2 h moving average; Origin Pro 8.5, OriginLabs, Northampton, MA) as\npreviously described30.\n\nMice were anesthetized at 24 h after the last exposure or on day 9 post-infection\nby an intraperitoneal injection with 100 mg/kg (BW) of pentobarbital\nsodium (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) and sacrificed by exsanguination.\nThe heart and lungs were removed en bloc, and the lungs were lavaged\nthree times with 0.6 ml of saline (0.9% sodium chloride) via a\ncannula inserted into the trachea as described previously7578.\nThe lavaged fluid was centrifuged, and the cell-free supernatants were frozen at\n\u221280\u00b0C for later analysis. The BAL inflammatory cell pellet\nwas resuspended in 1 ml saline and the total cell number was counted\nusing a hemocytometer. Cytospin slides (Thermo Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA) were\nprepared using 50,000 cells per slide, and differential cell counts (~500\ncells/slide) were performed on cytospin-prepared slides stained with Diff-Quik\n(Dade Behring, Newark, DE).\n\nThe levels of proinflammatory mediators, such as CCL2/monocyte chemotatic protein\n1 (MCP-1), CXCL2/macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2), interleukin 6 (IL-6)\nand TGF-\u03b21 in bronchioalveolar lavage fluid were measured by\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using respective duo-antibody kits\n(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions. The results were expressed in the\nsamples as pg/ml.\n\nFixed tissues were H&E stained for inflammation scoring and mean\nlinear intercept analysis. Histological analysis of H&E stained\nslides were used to determine bronchial inflammation using a semi-quantitative\nmethod. Briefly, the intensity of bronchial inflammation was scored on a scale\nof 1 to 9. 0, for no inflammation; 1\u20133 for scant cells but not\nforming a defined layer; 4\u20136, for one to three layers of cells\nsurrounding the vessels; 7\u20139, for four or greater layers of cells\nsurrounding the vessel or bronchial area. For each treatment multiple lung lobes\nfrom n = 4-5 slide/group were scored and average values were presented as\nbronchial inflammation scores.\n\nSimilarly airway mucus was identified by the Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) staining\n(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and PAS positive cells were quantified by a\nsemi-quantitative method with slight modification as previously described61. In brief, airways were examined under light microscopy and\nassigned a score between 0 and 3 based on the following criteria: 0, for no\nstaining; 1, for PAS staining <25% of airway perimeter; 2, for PAS\nstaining 25 to <50% of airway perimeter; and 3, for PAS staining\n>50% of airway perimeter. Mucus scores were obtained by scoring\n3\u20134 different areas per slide from n = 4-5 slide/group. The average\nfrom all the areas scored per each treatment group was used to calculate the\npercentage of PAS positive cells.\n\nImmunostaining was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung tissue.\nParaffin sections (4 \u00b5m thick) were deparaffinized and\nthen rehydrated through series of xylene and graded ethanol. Antigen retrieval\nwas performed by heating in citrate buffer (10 mM Citric acid, 0.05%\nTween 20, pH 6.0). Primary antibody was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C\nwith rabbit anti-CCSP polyclonal antibody (Seven Hills Bioreagents, Cincinnati,\nOH) and mouse anti \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (Abcam, Cambridge, MA)\nantibodies32747679. Appropriate fluorescently labeled\nsecondary antibodies (FITC- or Texas red-conjugated 2\u00b0 antibodies)\nwere used to detect the immune complexes before tissues sections were\ncounterstained with 4\u2019,d-diamidino-2-phenylindole (dapi).\n\nGomori\u2019s trichrome staining was performed according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions (Richard-Allan Scientific, Kalamazoo,\nMI). The nuclei stains black, cytoplasm and muscle fibers in red and the\ncollagen deposition stains blue. Both double immunostaining and trichrome\nstained tissue sections were visualized with Nikon Eclipse Ni-U fluorescence\nmicroscope (Nikon, Melville, NY) and images were captured with a SPOT-RT3\ndigital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). Quantification of\nfibrosis was done using the Ashcroft scoring system80.\n\nMouse lungs (which had not been lavaged) were inflated by 1% low-melting point\nagarose at a pressure of 25 cm H2O, and then fixed with 4%\nneutral buffered formalin7475. Fixed lung tissues were\ndehydrated, embedded in paraffin and sectioned (4 \u03bcm)\nusing a rotary microtome (MICROM International GmbH). Lung sections were\ndeparaffinized and rehydrated by passing through a series of xylene and graded\nethanol, then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Alveolar size\nwas estimated from the mean linear intercept (Lm) of the airspace, which is a\nmeasure of airspace enlargement/emphysema using the MetaMorph software\n(Molecular Devices) as previously described307475. Lm was\ncalculated for each sample based on 10 random fields per slide observed at a\nmagnification of \u00d7200. The airway and vascular structures were\neliminated from the analysis.\n\nLung mechanical properties in mouse lung were determined using Scireq Flexivent\napparatus (Montreal, Canada) as described previously307475.\nBriefly, lung compliance (C), lung resistance (R), and tissue elastance (E) were\nmeasured in mice, anesthetized by sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg BW,\nintraperitoneally). A tracheotomy was performed, and an 18-gauge cannula was\ninserted 3 mm into an anterior nick in the exposed trachea and\nconnected to a computer controlled rodent ventilator (FlexiVent; SCIREQ).\nInitially, the mice were ventilated with room air (150 breaths/min) at a volume\nof 10 ml/kg body mass. After 3 min of ventilation, measurement of\nlung mechanical properties was initiated by a computer-generated program to\nmeasure quasi-static compliance, lung resistance, and tissue elastance at\n3 cm H2O positive end expiratory pressure obtained by\nfitting a model to each impedance spectrum. The calibration procedure removed\nthe impedance of the equipment and tracheal tube within this system81. These measurements were repeated three times for each animal\nusing Scireq FlexiVent apparatus (Montreal, Canada) as described previously30747579.\n\nTotal RNA was isolated from non-lavaged lung tissue specimens (stored in\nRNAlater, Ambion, Austin, TX) using RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA\nyields were determined by UV absorbance using a Nanodrop instrument (ND-1000\nSpectrophotometer, NanoDrop Technologies). cDNA was synthesized from\n0.5 \u03bcg of total RNA using the RT2 First\nStrand Kit (SABioscience, Frederick, MD). To validate the expression of diverse\ngenes in lung tissue by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) (Bio-Rad CXF-96\nreal-time system) using the SYBR Green qPCR Master mix from SABioscience. In\nchronic Air/CS exposed mice infected with or without influenza A virus, this\nincludes qPCR data from circadian genes at ZT0-ZT24 time point (n = 3-4\nmice/group) in all datasets. All the specific primers were purchased from\nSABioscience. Expression of genes was normalized to RPL13 (60S ribosomal protein\nL13 gene) levels. The samples from chronic air- and CS-exposed mice represented\nin this study were obtained from our previous study that was conducted in\nparallel with the chronic air and CS combined with influenza A virus\ninfection30. In chronic air exposure group, qPCR data\ngathered from circadian gene expression at the ZT24 time point (n = 2/air group)\nin all qPCR datasets. Relative RNA abundance was quantified by the comparative\n2-\u0394\u0394Ct methods. Significant rhythms of\ngene expression were verified using CircWave software (Version 1.4). In\naddition, the center of gravity (COG) or peak phase was determined for each\nrhythm using CircWave as previously described3082.\n\nThe period of PER2::LUC expression in each tissue explant was determined using a\nchi-squared periodogram analysis (LumiCycle Analysis Software, Actimetrics). A\nminimum of 5 days of data were used to calculate the period of PER2::LUC\nexpression in each explant of lung tissue. Period data from lung tissue were\nanalyzed with two-factor ANOVA. Data are representative of mean \u00b1\nSEM. For statistical analysis of qPCR data, CircWave software (Version 1.4) was\nemployed. In addition to multiple non-linear regression analyses to determine if\nthe data conform to a significant rhythm, CircWave also calculates the peak of\ngene expression or Center of Gravity (COG). The software determines a peak of\ngene expression even if the qPCR data do not conform to a significant circadian\nrhythm (P < 0.05). In addition to CircWave analysis,\nstatistical significance between air-exposed, Air+Virus and CS+Virus groups was\ncalculated by Fisher\u2019s multiple comparisons using two-way ANOVA. To\nemphasize the waveform of the data, percentage of daily activity (light and dark\nphase) was subjected to nonlinear regression analysis with a 6th\norder polynomial using GraphPad (Prism 6). Statistical analysis of significance\nwas calculated using one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) followed by\nTukey\u2019s post-hoc test for multi-group comparisons using\nStatView software. Mortality was evaluated by comparison of survival curves and\nanalyzed for significance by Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test using GraphPad (Prism\n6). P < 0.05 was considered as significant.\n\nI.K.S., I.R., M.T.S., and B.P.L. conceived and designed the experiments; I.K.S.,\nT.A., H.Y., J.H., J.G., and M.T.S. performed the experiments; I.K.S., J.H., M.T.S.\ndata analysis; I.K.S., T.A., H.Y., J.H., M.T.S., B.P.L., and I.R. interpretation of\nresults, editing the manuscript; I.K.S.
