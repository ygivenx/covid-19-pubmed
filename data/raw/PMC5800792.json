{"title": "A CRISPR toolbox to study virus\u2013host interactions", "body": "Historically, loss-of-function screens have lagged behind gain-of-function approaches in mammalian cells owing to the lack of efficient tools that can mutate both alleles in diploid genomes in a high-throughput manner.\n\nGain-of-function approaches. Gain-of-function approaches rely on the ectopic overexpression of genes and have been successful in identifying cell surface receptors that are required for viral entry and host viral restriction factors. To identify entry receptors, a cell line that is refractory to infection is typically transduced with a complementary DNA library (cDNA library) derived from a cell type that is permissive to infection. For example, claudin 1 (CLDN1)18 and occludin (OCLN)19 were identified as entry receptors for HCV by transducing a non-permissive cell line with a cDNA library derived from hepatocellular carcinoma cells. In addition to discovering receptors, an unbiased expression screen also discovered that SEC14-like protein 2 (SEC14L2), which is a cytosolic lipid-binding protein, enhances the replication of clinical strains of HCV20. Furthermore, a library of \u223c380 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) was used to identify key proteins that are important for innate immune defences against several DNA and RNA viruses21,22. In addition to these screens, in a continuing effort, comprehensive cDNA libraries that contain all annotated ORFs from humans have been cloned into lentiviral expression vectors23, generating an expression vector library that is likely to improve the utility of gain-of-function screens in the study of host\u2013pathogen interactions.\n\nLoss-of-function genetic screens. Loss-of-function screens are based on the stable knockdown or knockout of genes. Initial approaches that used RNAi have provided valuable insights into virus\u2013host relationships24. In contrast to RNAi, which leads to the partial depletion of expression for a specific gene, recent technological advances have made it possible to completely disrupt gene expression (Table 1). One approach, termed haploid genetic screening, relies on insertional mutagenesis of genes in cultured haploid cell lines. For example, retroviral gene traps that contain a splice acceptor site can integrate into the host genome, leading to the expression of truncated mRNA transcripts7. The complete ablation of gene expression can have marked effects on virus replication and enables the identification of the most crucial host factors for virus infection. Insertional mutagenesis in haploid cells has been used to discover essential receptors for several viruses, including Ebola virus and Lassa virus25,26. Both viruses use abundant lysosomal proteins as receptors. The interaction between the Ebola virus glycoprotein and its receptor Niemann\u2013Pick C1 protein (NPC1) is triggered by cathepsin cleavage27,28, whereas the Lassa virus glycoprotein interacts with its receptor, lysosome- associated membrane glycoprotein 1 (LAMP1), following acidification of the endosome. Subsequent structural studies defined the binding interface between the viral glycoprotein and NPC1 (Refs 29,30,31). Interestingly, several mutations arose in the host-binding site of the viral glycoprotein during the 2013\u20132016 Ebola virus epidemic. These mutations increased the infectivity of the virus in primate cells but not in rodent cells, which suggests that these mutations contributed to adaptation and spread in humans32,33.\n\nHaploid genetic screens were important for the discovery of a cellular phospholipase that enables viral evasion of an antiviral restriction mechanism that is broadly active against many picornaviruses34. Recently, a haploid screen identified a proteinaceous receptor that enables virus entry for multiple distinct serotypes of adeno- associated virus (AAV)35, potentially affecting the use of AAV as a gene therapy vector. These and other studies have established loss-of-function screens as a reliable strategy to uncover host factors that are crucial for virus replication (Table 2).\n\nThe potential for CRISPR\u2013Cas screens to discover host factors that are crucial for viral pathogenesis is great and may lead to the development of new antivirals65. Several viruses have been studied using CRISPR\u2013Cas screens.\n\nMosquito-borne flaviviruses. The mosquito-borne flaviviruses include important pathogens such as DENV66. More recently, ZIKV has emerged in Brazil and is spreading at a rapid pace throughout South America67, causing severe congenital abnormalities in the unborn children of pregnant mothers who are infected68. The biogenesis and membrane topology of mature flavivirus proteins is complex and involves the translation of a polyprotein at the ER membrane, the co-translational and post-translational insertion of several membrane-spanning hydrophobic helices, and polyprotein cleavage by a viral protease and several host proteases into the mature viral proteins. Despite this knowledge of these processes, a detailed understanding of the host proteins that are involved is lacking.\n\nCRISPR\u2013Cas screens that were carried out independently using DENV61, WNV69,70 and ZIKV71 have each identified a number of ER proteins that are required for virus replication (Fig. 2). Many of these proteins are involved in the biosynthesis of membrane and secretory proteins, a core function of the ER. In particular, the proteins that were identified have described roles in N-linked glycosylation, ERAD, and signal peptide insertion and processing. Notably, the identification of these proteins was reproduced in replica screens in the same laboratory and in independent screens in different laboratories using different cell lines and different virus strains. There was also a substantial overlap with results from haploid genetic screens. This reproducibility is remarkable and a major advantage of this technology.\n\nCRISPR\u2013Cas technology also provides a reliable way to validate candidate genes and measure the effects of knockouts on virus replication. In contrast to knockdown approaches, such as RNAi, gene knockouts are absolute and do not result in the variable levels of depletion seen with RNAi. This enables a faithful comparison between genes when quantitative assays for virus replication are used, such as quantitative PCR, immunostaining or plaque assays. Remarkably, flavivirus replication was decreased 100\u201310,000-fold when the most significantly enriched host factors from the screens were knocked out61. This demonstrates that pooled sgRNA screens have the potential to identify host factors that are essential for virus replication.\n\nMoreover, CRISPR\u2013Cas knockout cells can be used to understand the molecular basis of knockout phenotypes and to help identify the stage of the virus life cycle in which the host factor is involved. For example, the OST complex was found to be required for viral RNA synthesis, but not for viral entry and translation61. The OST complex catalyses the N-linked glycosylation of newly synthesized proteins. In mammalian cells, two distinct OST multiprotein complexes are formed, each composed of a catalytic subunit (one of two paralogues, STT3A or STT3B) and accessory subunits72. Both isoforms are individually required for the replication of DENV, as knockout of either STT3A or STT3B resulted in complete abrogation of DENV replication. Other mosquito-borne flaviviruses, including ZIKV, are exclusively dependent on the STT3A isoform for viral RNA replication, which indicates a specific but divergent virus\u2013host interaction (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, the catalytic activity of STT3A and STT3B was dispensable for virus replication, because catalytically inactive mutant proteins were able to restore DENV replication in the knockout cells, which indicates that the OST complex has an unconventional role in DENV replication. The OST complex was found to bind to multiple non-structural viral proteins that form the RNA synthesis complex at the ER61, which suggests that the OST complex acts as a scaffold to coordinate the assembly of a functional DENV RNA replication complex.\n\nOther host factors that were found to be required for flavivirus replication include SEC61A1 and SEC63, which form the translocon channel in the ER membrane; the translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex, which stimulates co-translational translocation of polypeptides into the ER73; and the signal peptidase complex that cleaves signal peptides in the ER lumen. Knockout of a subset of signal peptidase complex subunits (SPCSs) revealed severe defects in the polyprotein cleavage of multiple flaviviruses. In particular, cleavage of the structural proteins prM and E from the polyprotein was affected, leading to marked defects in the release of virus particles70.\n\nComponents of the ERAD pathway were also found to be important for flavivirus replication. This protein quality control mechanism targets incorrectly folded proteins in the ER lumen for retrotranslocation through the ER membrane to the cytosol, in which proteasomal degradation occurs74. Two categories of ERAD components were found in the CRISPR\u2013Cas screens: first, components of the classical ERAD machinery, including SEL1L, derlin 2 (DERL2) and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 J1 (UBE2J1), which are part of the retrotranslocation complex75; and second, components of the ER membrane complex (EMC), an evolutionarily conserved complex that has less-well-understood roles in ERAD76. Knockout of ERAD components led to substantial decreases in viral-RNA accumulation, particle formation and virus-induced cell death for DENV, ZIKV, Japanese encephalitis virus and WNV61,69,70. However, how ERAD functions promote flavivirus replication remains to be fully understood.\n\nIt is important to note that in contrast to genetic screens with several other viruses (for example, Ebola virus), screens with WNV and DENV have not been able to identify a specific receptor that is required for viral entry into host cells. This is most probably due to redundancy in entry routes, such that knockout of one virus receptor still leaves cells susceptible through a different route. Indeed, several receptors have been reported for DENV77. Nevertheless, CRISPR\u2013Cas screens have contributed to our understanding of flavivirus biology, revealing a central role for several ER complexes in promoting flavivirus infection.\n\nHCV. Another important pathogen that has been investigated using CRISPR\u2013Cas screens is HCV, which causes chronic liver disease in \u223c160 million infected individuals worldwide78. Whereas mosquito-borne flaviviruses have a dependence on ER proteins, screening with HCV, which is a more distantly related member of the family Flaviviridae, revealed non-overlapping hits, including entry receptors CD81, OCLN and CLDN1, the liver-specific microRNA miR-122 and several RNA-binding proteins and metabolic enzymes61 (Fig. 2). One of the most significant hits was ELAVL1, an RNA-binding protein that is involved in mRNA stabilization79. HCV RNA replication was markedly reduced in ELAVL1-knockout cells, whereas RNA replication for other RNA viruses (for example, DENV and poliovirus) was unaffected. The HCV screens also uncovered an unexpected link between intracellular FAD levels and HCV RNA replication. The enzymes riboflavin kinase (RFK) and FAD synthase (FLAD1), which are involved in the conversion of riboflavin (vitamin B2) to FAD, were found to be crucial for the replication of HCV. Lumiflavin, an inhibitor of cellular uptake of riboflavin, potently inhibited viral RNA replication, which indicates that the modulation of intracellular FAD levels could be explored as an antiviral treatment. Host-targeted antiviral therapeutics may become an effective strategy to control virus replication because they may present a higher genetic barrier for resistant mutants to evolve than virus-targeting antivirals, and they have the potential to inhibit a broader range of viruses65. For example, cyclophilin A (CYPA) is a host factor that is required for HCV replication and also promotes HIV infection80,81,82. CYPA inhibitors have advanced to phase II/III clinical trials for the treatment of HCV infection, and their use is also being explored to treat other viral infections83.\n\nNoroviruses. Human noroviruses are a leading cause of gastroenteritis globally. Although their mechanism of entry and cellular receptor remain unknown, carbohydrates \u2014 in particular, the histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) \u2014 have been shown to have a role in human norovirus entry84. Unbiased genetic CRISPR\u2013Cas screens led to the discovery of CD300LF (also known as CLM1) as a proteinaceous receptor for murine norovirus85,86. CD300LF knockout abolished murine norovirus infection in mouse cell lines and in a mouse model of murine norovirus infection. Moreover, the expression of mouse CD300LF in human cells made them susceptible to murine norovirus infection. The discovery of a key host receptor that is necessary and sufficient for the binding of murine norovirus raises the possibility that human noroviruses also require a specific proteinaceous receptor or receptors. The recent development of a more reliable in vitro infection model for human noroviruses87 combined with CRISPR\u2013Cas technology could lead to a better understanding of the entry pathway that is used by human noroviruses and to the development of entry inhibitors.\n\nHIV. To identify host factors that are required for HIV replication, a CRISPR\u2013Cas screen was carried out in a physiologically relevant CD4+ T cell line88. In addition to the T cell surface glycoprotein CD4 and the co- receptor CC-chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) that are required for entry of CCR5-tropic viruses, a cell adhesion molecule named CD166 antigen (ALCAM) and two proteins, protein tyrosine sulfotransferase 2 (TPST2) and adenosine 3\u2032-phospho 5\u2032-phosphosulfate transporter 1 (SLC35B2), that are involved in tyrosine sulfation were found to be important for HIV infection. To validate these findings, electroporation was used to introduce Cas9\u2013sgRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes into CD4+ T cells that were isolated from the blood of healthy human donors, and these cells were then challenged with CCR5-tropic HIV. This demonstrates that CRISPR\u2013Cas technology can be used to study host factors in primary cells.\n\nBacteria, parasites and immune signalling. Genome-scale knockout screens have also been used to uncover immune-regulatory networks89, the pyroptosis pathway90 and host requirements for bacterial pathogenesis91,92,93. CRISPR\u2013Cas screens in Toxoplasma gondii have also identified genes that are essential for the fitness of apicomplexan parasites94. In bacteria, partial knockdowns using CRISPR interference enabled the systematic phenotypic identification of essential bacterial genes in Bacillus subtilis95.\n\nCRISPR\u2013Cas technology has broad applications in the study of viruses, extending beyond host factor screens. CRISPR\u2013Cas methods are being used to generate both in vitro and in vivo models to study viral pathogenesis, to edit and image viral genomes, in the development of gene drive systems that have the potential to eradicate viral disease vectors, and to advance the development of antiviral therapeutics (Fig. 3).\n\nGeneration of\nin vitro\nand\nin vivo\nmodels to study viral disease. Traditionally, in vitro systems using cell lines have been invaluable tools to study virus infections. However, these systems have limitations in providing comprehensive insights into host physiology, immunity, pathology and transmission during infection. CRISPR\u2013Cas technology has been used to generate advanced in vitro and in vivo knockout models to study viral pathogenesis, such as primary cells, organoids, induced-pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)96,97,98 and animal models99. CRISPR\u2013Cas methods have expedited the process of generating knockout animal models. In addition to genome engineering of laboratory animals, such as roundworms100,101, fruit flies102,103 and mice104,105, CRISPR\u2013Cas approaches can be applied to non-model organisms, such as mosquitoes106, ticks, bats, pigs107,108, macaques109, ferrets110 and chickens111, which are important vectors or reservoirs of viruses. For example, bats are reservoirs for rabies virus, Nipah virus, Ebola virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, whereas mosquitoes transmit DENV, ZIKV, WNV and chikungunya virus104. Ferrets are a suitable animal model to study influenza viruses112. Previously, it was challenging to genetically engineer ferrets. Ferrets that have been genetically engineered using CRISPR\u2013Cas technology have recently been reported and may substantially broaden the application of the ferret model in the study of influenza virus pathogenesis and transmission110.\n\nCRISPR\u2013Cas tools for studying large DNA viruses. Efficient genetic modification of large viral genomes has been limited by conventional molecular cloning techniques, especially for DNA viruses that belong to the proposed order Megavirales. For example, it has been challenging to edit the genomes of human poxviruses, which range from 130 kb to 375 kb in size. However, CRISPR\u2013Cas technology has been used to efficiently edit the genomes of large DNA viruses, such as vaccinia virus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus and adenoviral vectors113,114,115.\n\nCRISPR\u2013Cas antiviral strategies. There is also potential for the application of CRISPR\u2013Cas technology in the prevention and treatment of diseases by targeting viruses and their vectors. Vector control has been used as a strategy to limit the transmission of vector-borne viruses, including ZIKV, DENV and yellow fever virus. For example, several attempts have been made to introduce genetically modified, sterile mosquitoes into the environment in an attempt to eradicate wild-type mosquito populations that transmit viral diseases116,117,118,119. CRISPR\u2013Cas tools have been used to generate gene drives that have the potential to diminish mosquito populations120,121. Furthermore, CRISPR\u2013Cas technology could be used to treat persistent virus infections, such as infections with HIV, HBV, HCV and herpes simplex virus122,123,124,125. Recently, HBV covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), the hallmark of persistent HBV infection, has been successfully targeted in cell culture and in animal models126,127,128,129. In addition, CRISPR\u2013Cas screens can be used to understand the mode of action of antivirals. For example, CRISPR\u2013Cas and short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screens carried out in parallel uncovered the mechanism of action of GSK983, an antiviral drug that may prove effective in the treatment of a wide range of RNA and DNA viruses130,131. GSK983 was found to block virus replication by inhibiting the cellular pyrimidine biosynthesis enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, thus reducing intracellular levels of nucleotides, which are needed for viral nucleic acid synthesis.\n\nThe repurposing of the CRISPR\u2013Cas system as a genome-engineering tool is starting to transform biomedical research in several areas, including infectious diseases, cancer and gene therapy. This new approach is also being used to gain a better understanding of how viruses exploit their host and to develop new antiviral therapeutics. Since its discovery, CRISPR\u2013Cas technology has already advanced our understanding of the life cycles of noroviruses and flaviviruses. Future screens will undoubtedly shed light on commonalities and differences in how viruses have evolved to exploit and subvert host functions, and may provide potential targets for antiviral therapy. Together with advances in the genetic engineering of animal models using CRISPR\u2013Cas and improvements in field applications such as gene drive systems, these new CRISPR\u2013Cas technologies will help us to tackle current and future viral epidemics.\n\nContinued efforts to develop and enhance CRISPR\u2013Cas systems will expand the toolbox that enables us to gain a greater understanding of complex biological and disease processes. Engineering of Cas nucleases will make DNA and RNA targeting more versatile. For example, Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 is smaller than most Cas9 nucleases that have been used to date, making in vivo delivery of Cas9\u2013sgRNA complexes more feasible132,133; and the CRISPR-associated endoribonuclease C2c2 could lead to the development of new RNA-targeting tools134,135. Moreover, CRISPR\u2013Cas systems can be combined with other technologies to develop more sophisticated screening approaches. Combining CRISPR\u2013Cas technology with advances in single-cell profiling could lead to better measurements of virus replication dynamics136,137,138,139,140. Furthermore, a screening strategy that investigates epistatic relationships (for example by combining haploid and CRISPR\u2013Cas mutagenesis60), will enable the systematic analysis of functional interdependencies between the host genes that are most crucial for virus infection. We expect that refining and expanding the genetic toolbox for manipulating host cells will lead to novel insights into the 'arms race' between viruses and their hosts."}
