{"title": "Complemented palindrome small RNAs first discovered from SARS coronavirus", "body": "In this study, we reported for the first time the existence of complemented palindrome small RNAs 26 (cpsRNAs) and proposed cpsRNAs and palindrome small RNAs (psRNAs) as a novel class of small RNAs. 27\n\nThe first discovered cpsRNA UCUUUAACAAGCUUGUUAAAGA from SARS coronavirus named CoV-cpsR-22 contained 22 nucleotides perfectly matching its reverse complementary sequence. Small RNA sequencing (small RNA-seq or sRNA-seq) is used to acquire thousands of short RNA 58 sequences with lengths of usually less than 50 bp. With sRNA-seq, many novel non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) 59 have been discovered. For example, two featured series of rRNA-derived RNA fragments (rRFs) constitute a 60 novel class of small RNAs [1] . Small RNA-seq has also been used for virus detection in plants [2] [3] [4] and 61\n\ninvertebrates [5] . In 2016, Wang et al. first used sRNA-seq data from the NCBI SRA database to prove that 62 sRNA-seq can be used to detect and identify human viruses [6] , but the detection results were not as good as 63 those of plant or invertebrate viruses. To improve virus detection in mammals, our strategy was to detect and 64 compare featured RNA fragments in plants, invertebrates and mammals using sRNA-seq data. In one 65 previous study [7] , we detected siRNA duplexes induced by plant viruses and analyzed these siRNA 66 duplexes as an important class of featured RNA fragments. In this study, we detected siRNA duplexes 67 induced by invertebrate and mammal viruses a n d unexpectedly discovered another important class of 68 featured RNA fragments, which were complemented palindrome small RNAs (cpsRNAs). Among all the 69 detected cpsRNAs, we found a typical 22-nt cpsRNA UCUUUAACAAGCUUGUUAAAGA from SARS 70 coronavirus (SARS-CoV) strain MA15, which deserved further studies because mice infected with SARS-71\n\nCoV MA15 died from an overwhelming viral infection with virally mediated destruction of pneumocytes 72 and ciliated epithelial cells [8] . Although the palindromic motif TCTTTAACAAGCTTGTTAAAGA was 73 already observed in a previous study [9] , it never be considered to be transcribed as cpsRNAs before our 74 studies. 75\n\nThe first discovered cpsRNA named SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 contained 22 nucleotides perfectly 76 matching its reverse complementary sequence. In our previous study of mitochondrial genomes, we had 77 reported for the first time a 20-nt palindrome small RNA (psRNA) named hsa-tiR-MDL1-20 [10]. The 78 biological functions of hsa-tiR-MDL1-20 had been preliminarily studied in our previous study, while the 79 biological functions of SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 were still unknown. In this study, we compared the features of 80 siRNA duplexes induced by mammal viruses with those induced by plant and invertebrate viruses and found 81 that siRNA duplexes induced by mammal viruses had significantly lower percentages of total sequenced 82 reads and it seemed that they were only produced from a few sites on the virus genomes. One possible 83 reason could be a large proportion of sRNA-seq data is from other small RNA fragments caused by the 84 presence of a number of dsRNA-triggered nonspecific responses such as the type I interferon (IFN) 85 synthesis [11] . Another possible reason could be the missing siRNA duplexes or siRNA fragments functions 86 in cells by interaction with host RNAs or proteins. Based on this idea, we suspected that SARS-CoV-cpsR-87 22 could play a role in SARS-CoV infection or pathogenicity. Then, we performed RNAi experiments to test 88 the cellular effects induced by SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 and its segments. 89\n\nIn this study, we reported for the first time the existence of cpsRNAs. Further sequence analysis 90 supported that SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 could originate from bat betacoronaviruses. The results of RNAi 91 .

The discovery of psRNAs and cpsRNAs paved the way to find new 94 markers for pathogen detection and reveal the mechanisms in the infection or pathogenicity from a different 95 point of view. 96 97\n\nIn this study, 11 invertebrate viruses were detected using 51 runs of sRNA-seq data (Supplementary 100 file 1) and two mammal viruses (H1N1 and SARS-CoV) were detected using 12 runs of sRNA-seq data. In 101 our previous study, six mammal viruses were detected using 36 runs of sRNA-seq data [6] . The detection of 102 siRNA-duplexes by 11 invertebrate and eight mammal viruses was performed using a published program in 103 our previous study [7] . Then, we compared the features of siRNA duplexes induced by invertebrate viruses 104 ( Figure 1A ) with those induced by plant viruses ( Figure 1B) . The results showed that the duplex length was 105 the principal factor to determine the read count in both plants and invertebrates. 21-nt siRNA duplexes were 106 the most abundant duplexes in both plants and invertebrates, followed by 22-nt siRNA duplexes in plants 107 but 20-nt siRNA duplexes in invertebrates. 21-nt siRNA duplexes with 2-nt overhangs were the most 108 abundant 21-nt duplexes in plants, while 21-nt siRNA duplexes with 1-nt overhangs were the most abundant 109 21-nt duplexes in invertebrates but they had a very close read count to that of 21-nt siRNA duplexes with 2-110 nt overhangs. 18-nt, 19-nt, 20-nt and 22-nt siRNA duplexes in invertebrates had much higher percentages of 111 total sequenced reads that those in plants. In addition, 18-nt and 19-nt siRNA duplexes had very close read 112 counts and 20-nt and 22-nt siRNA duplexes had very close read counts in invertebrates. Since siRNA 113 duplexes induced by mammal viruses had significantly lower percentages of total sequenced reads, the 114 comparison of siRNA-duplex features between mammals and invertebrates/or plants could not provide 115 meaningful results using the existing public data with standard sequencing depth. However, as an 116 unexpected result from siRNA-duplex analysis, we discovered cpsRNAs from invertebrate and mammal 117 viruses. 118\n\nOne typical cpsRNA UCUUUAACAAGCUUGUUAAAGA (DQ497008: 25962-25983) located in the 119 orf3b gene on the SARS-CoV strain MA15 genome was detected in four runs of sRNA-seq data (SRA: 120 SRR452404, SRR452406, SRR452408 and SRR452410). This cpsRNA was named SARS-CoV-cpsR-22, 121 which contained 22 nucleotides perfectly matching its reverse complementary sequence (Figure 2A) . We 122 also detected one 18-nt and one 19-nt segment of SARS-CoV-cpsR-22, which could also be derived from 123 siRNA duplexes ( Figure 2B ) but their strands (positive or negative) could not be determined. Among 124 SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 and its two segments, the 19-nt segment was the most abundant and the 22-nt SARS-125\n\nCoV-cpsR-22 was the least abundant. 126 .

The well-known samples of palindromic DNA motifs include restriction enzyme sites, 130 methylation sites and palindromic motifs in T cell receptors [12] . In this study, we found that palindromic or 131 complemented palindrome small RNAs motifs existed ubiquitously in animal virus genomes, but not all of 132 them were detected to be transcribed and processed into cpsRNAs probably due to inadequate sequencing 133 depth of the sRNA-seq data. For example, we only found two psRNAs ( The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

The invertebrate and mammal 201 viruses were detected from sRNA-seq data using VirusDetect [4] and their genome sequences were 202 downloaed from the NCBI GenBank database. The description of sRNA-seq data and virus genomes is 203 presented in Supplementary file 1. The cleaning and quality control of sRNA-seq data were performed 204 using the pipeline Fastq_clean [15] that was optimized to clean the raw reads from Illumina platforms. 205\n\nUsing the software bowtie v0.12.7 with one mismatch, we aligned all the cleaned sRNA-seq reads to viral 206 genome sequences and obtained alignment results in SAM format for detection of siRNA duplexes using the 207 program duplexfinder [7] . Statistical computation and plotting were performed using the software R v2.15.3 208 with the Bioconductor packages [16] . The orf3b gene from human betacoronavirus (GenBank: 209 DQ497008.1), its 20 homologous sequences from bat betacoronavirus and nine homologous sequences from 210 civet betacoronavirus were aligned using ClustalW2 (Supplementary file 2) . After removal of identical 211 sequences, the orf3b gene from human betacoronavirus, eight homologous sequences from bat 212 betacoronavirus and two homologous sequences from civet betacoronavirus were used for phylogenetic 213 analysis. Since these homologous sequences had high identities (from 85.16% to 99.78%) to the orf3b gene 214 from DQ497008, the Neighbor Joining (NJ) method was used for phylogenetic analysis. 215 216\n\nBased on the shRNA design protocol [1], the sequences of SARS-CoV-cpsR-22, its 16-nt, 18-nt, 19-nt 218 20-nt segments ( Figure 2B ) and their control \"CGTACGCGGAATACTTCGA\" were selected to use as 219 target sequences for pSIREN-RetroQ vector construction (Clontech, USA), respectively. PC-9 cells were 220 divided into six groups named 22, 16, 18, 19, 20 and control for transfection using plasmids containing 221 20 -nt segments and control sequences. Each group had three 222 replicate samples for plasmid transfection and cell apoptosis measurement. Each sample was processed 223 following the same procedure described below. At 12 h prior to transfection, the PC-9 cells were washed 224 with PBS and trypsinized. Gbico RPMI-1640 medium was added into the cells, which were then centrifuged 225 at 1000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C to remove the supernatant. Gbico RPMI-1640 medium (Thermo Fisher 226 Scientific, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added to adjust the solvent to reach a volume of 2 227 \u03bc L and contain 2 \u2573 10 5 cells. These cells were seeded in one well of a 6-well plate for plasmid transfection. \n\nAll the cleaned sRNA-seq reads were aligned to viral genome sequences using the software bowtie v0.12.7 310 with one mismatch. The detection of siRNA duplexes was performed using the program duplexfinder [7] .

A. 16-nt, 318 18-nt, 19-nt, 20-nt and 22-nt siRNA duplexes were used for RNAi experiments. *16-nt and 20-nt had not 319 been detected in this study. B. All the homologous sequences at the 22-nt locus on civet betacoronavirus 320 genomes were identical to SARS-CoV-cpsR-22, while one of four genotypes at the 22-nt locus on bat 321 betacoronavirus genomes was identical to SARS-CoV-cpsR-22. C. The psRNA (heteropalindromic) hsa-tiR-322 MDL1 and cpsRNA SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 can form hairpins. D. The phylogenetic tree was built by the 323\n\nNeighbor Joining (NJ) method using the orf3b gene from human betacoronavirus, eight homologous 324 sequences from bat betacoronavirus and two homologous sequences from civet betacoronavirus. The 325\n\nbranch's length corresponds to an average number of nucleotide changes per 100 nucleotides. 326 327 Figure 3 .\n\nSARS-CoV-cpsR-22 induced cell apoptosis 328 PC-9 cells were divided into six groups named 22, 16, 18, 19, 20 and control for transfection using plasmids 329\n\ncontaining SARS-CoV-cpsR-22, its 16-nt, 18-nt, 19-nt, 20-nt segments. Each group had three replicate 330 samples for plasmid transfection and cell apoptosis measurement. Each sample was processed following the 331 same procedure. Cell apoptosis was measured at 72 h after transfection. The samples in this figure were 332 selected randomly from their corresponding groups. 333 334 .
