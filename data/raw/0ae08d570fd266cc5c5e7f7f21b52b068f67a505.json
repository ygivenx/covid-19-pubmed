{"title": "Chinese Journal of Natural Medicines A new Amaryllidaceae alkaloid from the bulbs of Lycoris radiata", "body": "Amaryllidaceae alkaloids are characteristic constituents of the Amaryllidaceae plant family, whose remarkable biological activities and unique skeletons have attracted great interest as challenging targets for total synthesis and diversity-oriented synthesis [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . A series of new Amaryllidaceae alkaloids was isolated from Hosta plantaginea Asch. in a previous phytochemical investigation, which showed some inhibition activities against the tobacco mosaic plant virus (TMV) [10] [11] . As a continuation of that research work, an Comparison of the NMR data of 1 with 2 suggested that 1 exhibited structural similarities with 2. Notable differences in the NMR spectra with those of 2 inferred that 1 exhibited closely similar signals to 2, except for the presence of an OEt group and the disappearance of the OMe group in 2. The presence of an OEt group located at C-6 instead of the OMe group in 1 was confirmed by the HMBC correlation of H-6 to C-15 and 1 H-1 H COSY correlation from H-15 to H-17. Thus, the structure of 1 was established and named as 2\u03b1-methoxy-6-O-ethyloduline. [13] . The IR (KBr) spectrum displayed absorption bands for a phenyl functional group (1 656, 1 608 and 905 cm \u22121 ) and a double bond (1 562 cm \u22121 ). The 1 H NMR spectrum (Table) showed one methyl singlet peak at \u03b4 2. 16 (3H, s, H-16) , two methoxyl groups at \u03b4 3.55 (3H, s, H-15) and \u03b4 3.43 (3H, s, H-14) , two aromatic protons at \u03b4 6.96 (1H, s,H-10) and 6.76 (1H, s, H-7), a signal for the H-atom of C=C double bond [\u03b4 5.46 (1H, s, H-6) ] and a signal for the O-CH 2 -O group [\u03b4 5.93 (2H, br s, H-13) ], respectively. The 13 C NMR spectrum (Table) revealed 19 signals comprising of five sp 2 quaternary C-atoms, five sp 3 CH, three sp 2 CH and three sp 3 CH 2 groups, as well as two OMe groups and one NMe group. The five sp 2 quaternary C-atoms were assignable to four aromatic C-atoms [\u03b4 147.3 (C-8) , 147.1 (C-9), 130.8 (C-6a), 126.9 (C-10a)] and a C-atom of C=C double bond [\u03b4 145.4 (C-4) ], 1 of 3 sp 3 CH 2 groups was attributable to a O-CH 2 -O group [\u03b4 101.1 (C-13) ], another two sp 3 CH 2 groups corresponded to a -CH 2 CH 2 \u2212 group. The above data proved that 2 was a homolycorine-type Amaryllidaceae alkaloid. The NMR data of 2 were closely similar to those of the known alkaloid 2\u03b1-hydroxy-6-O-methyloduline [14] . The minor difference between them was the presence of an additional methoxyl group signal at \u03b4 C (57.2) in 2. The HMBC correlation of H-2 to C-14, as well as the downfield shift of C-2 (\u03b4 C 78.1, \u0394\u03b4 C +9.8) [14] confirmed the structure. Thus, the planar structure of 2 was elucidated as shown in Fig. 2 .\n\nThe relative configuration of 2 was assigned as identical to that of 2\u03b1-hydroxy-6-O-methyloduline on the basis of the ROESY experiment and coupling constants [14] . Detailed analysis of the 2D NMR data established the structure of compound 2 as 2\u03b1-methoxy-6-O-methyloduline. This is the first time to report the NMR data of this alkaloid [15] .\n\nEight known homolycorine-type alkaloids (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) were also isolated and identified as trispherine (3) [14] , 8-O-demethylhomolycorine (4) [16] , homolycorine (5) [17] , 9-O-demethylhomolycorine (6) [18] , oduline (7) [19] , lycorenine (8) [20] , 6\u03b1-O-methyllycorenine (9) [21] , O-ethyllycorenine (10) [22] by comparison of their 1D-NMR data with those in the literature. All of the alkaloids were evaluated for inhibitory activities against flu virus A in vitro [23] , and alkaloids 1-3 showed weak antiviral activities with IC 50 values of 2.06, 0.69 and 2.71 \u03bcg\u0387mL \u22121 , and CC 50 values of 14.37, 4.79 and 80.12 \u03bcg\u0387mL \u22121 , respectively.\n\nPerkin-Elmer model 241 polarmeter; Bio-Rad FTS-135 spectrometer; Shimadzu UV-2401A spectrometer; Bruker AM-400 or a DRX-500 instrument (using TMS as internal standard); Finnigan MAT 90 instrument and VG Auto Spec-3000 spectrometer; silica gel (SiO 2 , 300\u2212400 mesh; Qingdao Marine Chemical Co., Ltd., China); MCI gel (CHP20P, 75\u2212150 \u00b5m; Mitsubishi Chemical Industries Ltd., Japan); Sephadex LH-20 (40\u221270 \u00b5m; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden); Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) . Semi-Preparative HPLC was performed on a Zorbax SB-C-18 column (i.d. 9.4 mm \u00d7 250 mm; Agilent Co. Ltd., Santa Clara, USA). TLC plates were pre-coated with silica gel GF-254 and HF-254 (Qingdao Marine Chemical Co., Ltd., China).\n\nThe bulbs of Lycoris radiata were bought from Hengyang, Hunan Province, China, in July 2008, and were identified by GONG Xun. A voucher specimen has been deposited with the Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China.\n\nThe air-dried and powdered sample (180 kg) was extracted with MeOH three times to give a crude extract. The crude extract was adjusted to pH 2\u22123 by dissolving in 0.5% HCl soln. The aqueous phase was extracted with EtOAc, and then the acidic H 2 O-soluble was adjusted to pH 9\u221210 with 10% aq.NH 3 soln. and extracted with CHCl 3 to give an alkaline extract (1.4 kg). The alkaline extract was subjected to CC (SiO 2 ; CHCl 3 /MeOH gradient 1 : 0\u21920 : 1) to afford seven fractions (A 1 \u2212A 7 ). Fraction A 1 (78 g) was applied to MCI gel (MeOH\u2212H 2 O, 30/70\u2212100/0), Sephadex LH-20 (MeOH), and then to silica gel CC eluting with petroleum ether(PE)/acetone/diethylamine (5 : 1 : 0.05) to yield 3 (17 g), 4 (41 mg), 7 (20 mg), and 9 (13 mg), respectively. Fraction A 2 (170 g) was subjected to repeated column chromatography (silica gel, Sephadex LH-20 (MeOH), and HPLC) to yield 1 (27 g), 2 (33 g), 10 (11 mg), respectively. Fraction A 3 (15 g) was purified by silica gel and HPLC to give 5 (14 mg), 6 (44 mg) and 8 (8 mg Homolycorine ( 4.81 (1H, ddd, J = 4.8, 1.8, 1.7 Hz, 2.49 (1H, m, 5.50 (1H, m, 2.72 (1H, dd, J = 9.6, 2.0 Hz, 7.57 (1H, s, , 6.99 (1H, s, 2.64 (1H, dd, J = 9.6, 1.8 Hz, 2.63 (2H, m, 3.14 (1H, ddd, J = 10.0, 7.0, 3.5 Hz, 2.24 (1H, dd, J = 18.0, 9.2 Hz, Oduline ( 3.14 (1H, ddd, J = 9.2, 6.3, 3.8 Hz, 2.25 (1H, dd, J = 18.7, 9.5 Hz, 5.97 (2H, d, J = 14.7 Hz, -OCH 2 O-), 3.67 (1H, s, -OH), 2.11 (3H, s, -NCH 3 ); 13 C NMR (100 MHz, MeOD) \u03b4: 66.7 (C-1), 31.7 (C-2), 115.7 "}
