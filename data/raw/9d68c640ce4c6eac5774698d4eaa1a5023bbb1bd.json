{"title": "Risk Analysis Framework Guidance for Wildlife Health Professionals", "body": "In the 1990s, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) implemented a standard methodology to be applied globally when assessing infectious disease risks of animals. According to the OIE, risk analysis comprises hazard identification, risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication. 4 Risk is defined in this context as the measure of the probability of the introduction of pathogens or other hazards to animals or animal populations. The hazard identification process seeks to establish which hazards (diseases) are of concern and how they may be introduced. Risk assessment is the process of estimating the probability or likelihood of hazard introduction, as well as the associated implications. The goal of risk management is to reduce both the likelihood and implications of the introduction of the identified hazards. The involvement of all potentially affected parties in the overall process (e.g., problem formulation, pathway and hazard prioritization, data collection and evaluation, result discussion and\n\nRisk aversion is a universal behavior, common to humans and animals alike, and is the topic of many diverse fields of study from economics, to mechanical and life sciences. 1 There is no global definition of \"risk\" or gold standard for its measures. Yet, most every discipline seeks to measure and manage risk, several with fundamentally similar approaches, and others unfortunately implementing very different terminology. Thus, when approaching the measurement and management of risk, one must consider the field of study within which the problem lies.\n\n\"Risk,\" at its core, is the potential of losing something of value, weighed against the potential to gain something of value. 1 In the health sciences, \"risk\" is generally defined as the probability of an adverse (or positive in some cases) event to occur in a defined population over a specified time interval. Risk can be exemplified through the basic equation:\n\nConsequence should it occur\n\nRisk can be characterized or measured in different ways: qualitatively (e.g., characterized as \"high,\" \"medium,\" or \"low\"), semi-quantitatively (e.g., rated on a scale of 1-5), or quantitatively (assigned a probability factor or percentage). The outcome should be paired with information regarding the level of uncertainty (how sure or unsure one is) surrounding the estimate, as well as full disclosure of the assumptions made during the process.\n\nOver the past half-century, standardized risk analysis methods have increasingly been applied to areas of health, and specifically to infectious diseases. In 1983, the US National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences (NRC-NAS) standardized the format for the assessment of the effects of hazardous chemicals on human health in what is referred to as the \"Red Book.\" 2 Standard risk analysis methodologies commonly used in animal \u2022 Conduct a background literature and data search on the problem-this often includes both scientific and policy information. \u2022 Create a list of all potential hazards (usually diseases in this case) that can then be prioritized through the hazard identification phase. \u2022 Establish the group's acceptable level of risk-the level at which stakeholders will require management action options. This accepts the basic premise that \"zero risk\" does not occur, or rarely occurs. Zero potential morbidity or likelihood of disease transmission is often not realistic. After Problem Formulation, the hazard identification and then the risk assessment phase (including pathways and threats, vulnerability and consequence assessments) are undertaken.\n\nFor illustrative purposes, this chapter presents one example of adaptive use of this framework in the form of a qualitative wildlife disease risk analysis exercise. A recent disease risk analysis was undertaken by the University of Minnesota, EcoHealth Alliance, and Food Systems Institute in partnership with the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The goal of the umbrella project is to prioritize and characterize the risk that the trade of wildlife and wildlife products poses to the US food and agriculture systems and public health. The implication of this research is to inform US regulating agencies of potential wildlife import risks that may have not been previously considered and to inform potential risk management and ongoing risk communication.\n\nBecause of the shear scope and volume of this issue, we first conducted an extended \"Problem Formulation Exercise\" (initial component of risk analysis) to better understand the issue and prioritize the most important import pathways; this was followed by three preliminary qualitative risk assessments (subsequent component of risk analysis).\n\nStep one, Problem Formulation, consisted of: \u2022 A summary of 13 years of US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Law Enforcement Management Information System (LEMIS) data, capturing all declared and undeclared US wildlife importation records 7 ; \u2022 A multi-phased stakeholder engagement survey to characterize and rank perceptions and priorities surrounding this proposed threat; \u2022 A multidisciplinary stakeholder workshop that reviewed results of the aforementioned data and survey results, and established ranking criteria to prioritize areas of greatest concern for further assessment. Core partners included advisors from the US Government (DHS, US Geological Survey, Food and Drug dissemination, management option evaluation, etc.) is the goal of risk communication. This is an important, but often overlooked, aspect of the risk analysis continuum and should take place throughout the entire process.\n\nSince 1992, the Conservation Breeding Specialist Group (CBSG, now the Conservation Planning Specialist Group [CPSG]) of the International Union for Conservation of Nature Species Survival Commission (IUCN-SSC) has been facilitating collaboration between experts in zoo and wildlife veterinary medicine, disease ecology, and population management to develop a set of methods and tools for realistic and rigorous analysis of disease risks in wildlife, and at the wildlife-domestic animal-human interface. In 2010, recognizing that the range of concerns in relation to wildlife disease had broadened well beyond those associated with animal movements, the OIE and IUCN sponsored the publication of the Manual of Procedures for Wildlife Disease Risk Analysis and its companion, the IUCN Guidelines for Wildlife Disease Risk Analysis. 5, 6 The intent of these publications is to assist in the implementation of risk assessment and management when making decisions regarding biodiversity conservation, wildlife health and biosecurity, and domestic animal and public health, when wildlife disease is a critical factor. In an attempt to support interdisciplinary collaboration, encourage informed decision making, align language, and limit confusion, the IUCN adopted the terminology and framework of the OIE in regard to wildlife risk analysis.\n\nThe standards and applications of risk analysis are laden with jargon, politics, and variability, which often cause unnecessary confusion and frustration. To begin, risk analysis and risk assessment are different. Risk analysis refers to the overall process, with its independent components. Risk assessment is merely a phase of the risk analysis process.\n\nDuring the introductory period risk analysis, the initial step-and a critical component of risk communication-is called Problem Formulation. During this step, one should do the following: \u2022 Write a general description of the problem, including why there is a need or opportunity for science-based policy or decision making in this case.\n\n\u2022 Illustrate the problem: draw a picture or diagram to visually represent the issue. \u2022 Identify the \"standard\" you will follow (in the following case study we will use OIE-IUCN Guidelines highlighted above) in order to establish what methodology will be implemented. \u2022 Identify pertinent stakeholders-those that will need to be a part of the process, or who the science-based policy issue or decision may affect. \u2022 Formulate a plan for communicating with and/or inclusion of stakeholders.\n\nis disease based, but it needn't be. Regardless, it is recommended to start with a list of ranking criteria related to the threat or hazard of concern under the conditions being considered. For disease, ranking criteria might consist of:\n\n\u2022 Infectivity/transmissibility (ID50 and LD50, Ro) \u2022 Pathogenicity \u2022 Severity such as morbidity, mortality, reproductive effects, immunosuppression \u2022 Presence of competent vectors \u2022 Species susceptibility, risk of crossing species barriers \u2022 Economic impacts on species of concern \u2022 Other ecosystem effects\n\nIn this particular analysis, the concern was based upon \"policy and economic\" criteria, highlighting diseases of international importance (as defined by OIE listing) being introduced into the US live animal agriculture system (i.e., What is the risk of introduction of OIE listed FAD into US livestock via the global wildlife trade?). In this case, the implied priority criterion would be transmissibility or infectiousness (\"spreadability\") once introduced, and its ability to cross species barriers and cause infection and/or illness. It is important to be very specific about the endpoint of concern because this is the equivalent of a research hypothesis in the risk analysis framework. In this case study, we were interested in confirmation of at least one \"case\" of FAD introduction as defined by the US FAD investigation guidelines. Each disease of concern should be evaluated via all the ranking criteria and then ranked overall. Often, this is done semi-quantitatively in a spreadsheet, or as a decision tree. In our particular case study, we were given further guidance by our stakeholders to prioritize FADs of ruminant livestock.\n\nThe real value of this process is for stakeholders to discuss which criteria make a disease important in a given scenario, before the assessment, in order to again prioritize time and resources on the most crucial issues. Technically, every high priority hazard must be evaluated further in the risk assessment phase-it is easier to evaluate 5 rather than 100 diseases, and potential hazard lists are often that long. In our case study, Rift Valley fever (RVF) ranked the highest priority, both objectively and through the expert elicitation process. The high-risk category also included foot and mouth disease and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever.\n\nIn the risk assessment phase, one must ask the questions, \"How likely is the hazard to occur?\" and \"What are the consequences if it does occur?\" for each priority disease identified in the hazard identification phase. The risk assessment phase involves building a representative model of the process, collecting data and/or expert opinion, and characterizing the outcome in some way. Disease modeling has recently become all but an entire discipline in itself; thus, only the basic premise is highlighted here. A risk assessment model is a simplification of the real world and should help determine the likelihood or probability of adverse health effects associated with hazard exposure. This Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Department of Agriculture [USDA]), as well as private agriculture industry representatives, academia, and several relevant nongovernmental organizations. Data on wildlife trade were derived from the \"EcoHealth Alliance 'LEMIS' database\"-a compilation of over 20 years of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and USFWS LEMIS data obtained from the USFWS via a series of requests over multiple years through the Freedom of Information Act. Country disease status and disease standards information were obtained through open access OIE sources such as the World Animal Health Information Database (WAHID). 8 Data regarding US agriculture were obtained through several USDA Agricultural Research Service/Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)/Foreign Agricultural Service portals, as well as through our advisory team led by Dr. Tracey Dutcher (One Health Coordination Office, APHIS).\n\nOver the 13.5 years examined, wildlife imports to the United States included a total of 5,207,420 individually identifiable shipments between January 1, 2000 and August 6, 2013. The number of annually declared wildlife shipments doubled during the period examined, reaching approximately 400,000 declared shipments imported in 2012 alone. These shipments involved a total of 11,033,468,322 individual specimens/animals, plus an additional 977,109,143 kilograms of specimens/animals measured only in weight. The majority of shipments contained mammals (27%), while the majority of total specimens imported were shells (57%) and tropical fish (25%).\n\nOf the more than 11 billion individual wildlife specimens imported, 27.4% were individually recorded as live upon entry (an annual average of 224.9 million [s = 42.3 million; median = 231.5 million] live animals plus an additional 1.8 million kilograms of live animals). Aquatic, amphibian, and invertebrate species accounted for approximately 50% of these live shipments, mainly imported by the aquatic and pet industries. Reptile, rodent, and bird species destined for the exotic pet trade made up the majority of remaining live imports. 7 Based upon these summary findings and stakeholder prioritization, three separate Risk Assessments were performed: \n\nOnce pathways of risk are established, the questions \"What can go wrong?\" and \"How can it go wrong?\" are posed (the core of hazard identification). Usually the discussion reflects multiple consequence factors including both the health of US populations (morbidity and mortality) as well as the economic results from transmission and disease. Specifically, this case study analysis was concerned with the consequences of exposure to the US cattle and swine industries, as this risk concern was expressly prioritized by our project stakeholders. However, consequences of exposure of additional animal (e.g., small ruminants) or human populations may be considered in future risk assessments.\n\nData Sources: For this case study, two main datasets were \"mined\" (i.e., studied) for analysis. First, we combined USFWS LEMIS data from 2000 to 2013 into a standardized dataset and used these data to extract all declared or confiscated live wildlife imports into the United States. Second, data on RVF official country status were obtained from the OIE's WAHID and Handistatus II portals. 8, 10 Approach/Assessment Platform: The general modeling approach applied here for risk assessment follows the qualitative methodology put forth in the IUCN/OIE Guidelines for Wildlife Disease Risk Analysis. 5 The general format for analyzing risk is the following: Risk = Entry Risk + Exposure Risk + Consequences.\n\nEntry Assessment: A total of 53 species were identified as meeting the minimum requirements of a medium-risk species or higher (17 Artiodactyla, 4 Carnivora, 10 Primate, 1 Proboscidea, 3 Perissodactyla, 12 Rodentia, and 6 Bat). Of the 53 identified species, 20 were imported between 2000 and 2013, half of which were Artiodactyla. The top six most imported medium-to very-high-risk species made up 82.9% of the total number of medium-to high-risk individuals imported. These six included the African lion (Panthera leo; n = 246), springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis; n = 134), cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus; n = 121), natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis; n = 100), desert warthog (Phacochoerus aethiopicus; n = 48), and impala (Aepyceros melampus; n = 45). Imports were further refined by country status, so there were 381 individuals from 84 shipments from 2000 to 2013 of high-to very-high-source risk. Because quarantine in the source country could not be confirmed to include vector control, and the majority of shipments were made in less than 3 days, it was assumed that little risk was mitigated during these factors. Therefore, entry risk was high-to very-high for n = 381 animals entering the United States over a 14-year period (2000-2013). This comprised 11 species, 5 of which were wild ruminants (187 of the 381 imported individuals; 49%). Large carnivores accounted for another 155 of the 381 (40.7%).\n\nExposure Assessment: In a case where an infectious animal enters the United States and quarantine measures are inadequate (e.g., mosquito exposure, subclinical long-term infectivity, and fomite transmission), the potential spread is high due to the fact that most high-risk imports were comprised of groups rather than individual animal shipments. This increases the potential spread and complexity of trace-back during investigation, should a negative scenario unfold. Quarantine procedures and regulations for wild may be qualitative or quantitative depending on the needs of the users and the amount and type of data available. Often, it also must be informed by expert opinion in the wildlife community due to lack of hard data. There are scientific methods, such as the Delphi method, among others, for the collection and analysis of expert opinion that may be used to add rigor to this process. 9 Risk assessment is an iterative process as both models and data are often refined and updated over time. Usually a brief qualitative assessment gives a good indication of general risk, which allows for the collection and assessment of available data and the likelihood of successful quantitative modeling. Quantitative models may be simple, or deterministic, using point estimates that usually don't reflect the range or variability of the data. Stochastic models are used to incorporate uncertainty surrounding point estimates, and involve the need to match the question and available data with the appropriate tool and method-a more expert modeler should be included in the team if this approach is taken. Often, policy makers want quantitative answers where there are no data to support the kind of model that would produce the type of specific advice requested. Providing inaccurate estimations of the limitations of current results is a major pitfall in this process. Thus, communicating this potential mismatch effectively is a large part of risk communication between scientists and policy makers.\n\nIn order to build a risk assessment model, the problem definition needs to be specifically refined, just like that of a scientific hypothesis. Under the OIE trade paradigm, the risk assessment is divided into three distinct parts: entry risk (threats), exposure risk (vulnerability), and consequences. Entry risk involves all steps in the pathways from countries of origin to the US ports of entry (i.e., incoming threats). Exposure involves any steps following entry in which an imported animal could potentially expose US populations of animals or people (i.e., US vulnerability to incoming threats). Consequences involve the severity of consequences that are likely to occur following exposure of US populations (either animal or human, to incoming threats).\n\nFrom the initial combination of country disease status and species host-pathogen status, the risk of exportation and ultimate entry of RVF into the United States can be increased or reduced by multiple steps along the trade pathway, which can be summarized as either shipment or quarantine factors that contribute to or mitigate risk. The exposure risk (vulnerability) assessment involves all steps in the pathway following arrival in the port of entry; these steps include transit to US quarantine, US quarantine itself, transit to the final destination, and interactions that may occur at the final destination between imported wildlife and nearby US populations. The consequences portion of the pathway but also potential costs of decisions associated with high priority pathogens and their impacts. The idea is to provide scientific input to managers or policy makers about the potential costs and benefits of options they are considering, or that stakeholders may suggest.\n\nIt is often said that risk analysis is an \"objective\" process. The reality is that in wildlife and/or disease risk analyses there are often so few data available that the analyst begins, subconsciously, to substitute value judgments for facts. Indeed, in assessing the consequences of disease introduction, for instance, a degree of subjectivity is almost unavoidable. While this may be less true for laboratory settings, it is more likely when assessing disease or environmental risks in freeranging wildlife. Risk analyses are seldom truly objective, and for this reason transparency in declaring all assumptions made is essential. 11 Most assessments go through several iterations, with data collection needs (gaps) highlighted, that are then either filled or augmented with gathered expert opinion. It is very important not only to cite the source of all data, but also to estimate the quality of the data as a contribution to an overall assessment of uncertainty surrounding results. Thus, risk analysis, although often policy driven, must be a scientifically honest evaluation of what we know and don't know. Transparency itself is a commitment to open communication.\n\nCommunicating Uncertainty: Assumptions are what we make when we are uncertain. Some assumptions are considered big, others small, depending on the lack of data or data quality. In these cases, there is usually a gradient of evidence, such as expert opinion, proven case studies, or even local knowledge. There are formal scientific processes for eliciting expert opinion (such as the Delphi method), and vetted methods to deal with the variability of uncertain data. The goal of this process is to lay the evidence out logically and to examine the accompanying level of confidence in order to make the best use of existing data, fill important gaps, and put responsible bounds around the results. A risk assessment may sometimes be criticized because many assumptions are made. However, these cases communicate the fact that data gaps exist, and great uncertainty is present, which is important to establish formally in many cases, because it allows for discussions regarding how one might collect data for an improved evaluation of risk.\n\nThe \"Precautionary Principle\": In situations where there is significant scientific uncertainty regarding a risk and its consequences, such as a cause-and-effect relationship not being fully established, the \"precautionary principle\" is often invoked. This principle holds that a more cautious approach should be taken in the face of insufficient information. In many cases, the precautionary approach has a useful protective effect as the initial response to a potential threat with consequence, especially where valuable threatened or endangered species-or the release of infectious diseases-are concerned. On the other hand, too much or unnecessary precaution may prevent vital progress ruminants are assumed to significantly reduce exposure risk when properly conducted, but there is great uncertainty surrounding this factor when quarantine occurs at non-USDA facilities, which was found to be a common occurrence. Further, there is quarantine effectiveness uncertainty regarding diseases such as RVF, the pathogenicity variability of which we are still working to understand in various wildlife species.\n\nSome nonruminant species, such as large, wild carnivores, are not required to be quarantined upon entry to the United States; others, such as rodents and nonhuman primates, may be regulated but not screened for RVF. In either case, internal domestic shipments may occur after port of entry-before quarantine-when quarantine is approved for non-USDA facilities. This adds uncertainty to the exposure assessment and may add risk. We found no data to help define potential risk pathways once animals exit the port of entry or quarantine station within the United States. This represents the greatest gap in information for this assessment and presents a major opportunity for innovation that would help assess the risks outlined or exemplified in this assessment. Further, final destination information was not made available for this assessment. Therefore, the best potential proxy for the missing pathway data above was not available. This represents an opportunity to further define risk and fill a major gap in this assessment.\n\nThus, exposure risk could not be sufficiently categorized with the data available, but exposure risk likely ranged from low to high depending on the taxonomic order of the imports; however, there was not a large number of risky importations relative to the large number of overall wildlife imports during this time period. Overall, many data gaps exist for this portion of the assessment.\n\nConsequence Assessment: Due to the high morbidity and mortality of the disease in cattle, and the potential for catastrophic economic loss in both cattle and swine industries, the risk of RVF imports was considered to be of low to high likelihood, but whatever level of risk, of high consequence.\n\nRisk management is the process of identifying, selecting, and implementing measures that can be applied to reduce the level of risk. Many times these are disease prevention and control strategies, such as vaccination and treatment of individuals or populations, or personal protective measures, such as wearing gloves and masks for humans facing zoonotic diseases. The idea is to rerun the model under different conditions or assumptions to see how the risk changes in response to intervention actions. Sensitivity analysis-the process of examining the impact of the variation in individual model inputs on the model outputs in a quantitative risk assessment-is often performed to accomplish this. Many times, cost is entered into the equation as well in order to conduct cost-benefit analyses of different management options. The result is a very powerful tool for management authorities to analyze not only risk, have little evidence-based information for pathogenesis in captive wildlife, or for how transmission may occur across the species barriers. This is another large data gap that affects the consequence assessment and presents further opportunity to support research on both the ecology and pathogenesis of these agents beyond the normal domestic animal realm. There is evidence that there is some level of risk of RVF transmission to US livestock from the importation of wildlife species. While the number of imports that are most likely to provide a risk of RVF transmission are relatively few compared to the overall large volume of imports, the consequences of a transmission event would be extensive. Because of this risk, we have recommended investment in further areas of research and further risk reduction measures.\n\nAssessing risk is part of the human (and animal) condition. It is a process by which we learn and change our behavior for a more successful future. Risk analysis that is transparent, logical, and testable is a purposeful method of conducting this conversation, and-ideally-informing decisions. Simply, it is the interface between science and management/policy decision making. It allows for a relatively quick situation analysis for immediate decision needs, as well as planning for better, more informed, decisions in the future through the collection of more/better data or the use of more sophisticated tools. In the end, it is the triage process of science-based management.\n\nin the long term. A transparent discussion of this approach is recommended. The risk communication strategy should include both more cautious and less cautious solutions for discussion.\n\nFinally, the risk communication process is essential in helping decision makers to deal with one of the most difficult problems encountered during the risk analysis process; namely, determining what constitutes an \"acceptable risk.\" Zero risk is seldom, if ever, attainable and some degree of risk is unavoidable-this must be stated at the outset. For example, what is the risk of reintroducing great apes into the wild? Can we ever hope to create a situation where there is zero risk of disease introduction? However, in our passion and excitement, we may convince managers and funders to move forward with little regard for potential implications if this is not discussed up front. On the other hand, health experts may unnecessarily throw up arbitrary barriers due to high perceived risk, which is unsupported by a lack of data and/or great uncertainty surrounding adverse outcomes. This discussion intersects with that of the precautionary principle approach. The goal of risk analysis is to decrease gridlock, not create paralysis.\n\nIn the example case study provided here, the statement of \"Conclusions and Uncertainty\" follows: \u2022 Overall, with the USFWS LEMIS data available, we can make confident statements about viable entry pathways and volume of trade. These data are limited to declared shipments and confiscations. We found no way to adequately estimate the illegal wildlife trade. \u2022 By using the OIE WAHID, we can infer source risk by region but have no way to assess the prevalence in wildlife or the specific source of animals beyond the country of origin and the port of export. \u2022 The largest point of uncertainty in the entry assessment surrounds the likelihood that any given animal selected for shipment is adequately represented by the country status from which it came. \u2022 We used country status, as reported by the OIE, as a proxy for source risk. According to experts, there is major uncertainty surrounding self-reported data on many diseases from many countries. \u2022 Surprisingly, for exposure assessment, there is generally less data available from which to estimate risk within the United States than there is from outside US borders. The complete lack of formal data on animal movement within the United States after entry limits our ability to assess the wildlife-livestock interface potential at the endpoint of this trade pathway.\n\n\u2022 The acquisition of \"importer\" data might help tighten this assessment slightly but won't detail the post-entry transportation methods, the final destination characteristics, and the purposes of imports (i.e., exposure of imported animals to humans or other animals). \u2022 Most of the hazards/diseases prioritized by our stakeholders were high consequence on either economic or population morbidity/mortality scales (as confirmed through stakeholder elicitation above).
