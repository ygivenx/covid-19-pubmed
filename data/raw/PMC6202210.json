{"title": "A CRISPR screen identifies IFI6 as an ER-resident interferon effector that blocks flavivirus replication", "body": "Huh7.5, U-2 OS, A549, 293T (from C. Rice), 293 (from N. Conrad), and COS-7 (from N. Alto) and all derivatives were maintained in \u201ccomplete\u201d DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco) and 1x NEAA (Gibco). Human STAT1\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts (from J-L. Casanova) were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco) and 1x NEAA (Gibco). BHK21-J (from C. Rice) were grown in MEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1x NEAA. Stable cells expressing antibiotic resistance genes were grown in complete media supplemented with puromycin (Sigma) at 4\u03bcg/mL or blasticidin (Gibco) at 15 \u03bcg/mL. Normal human dermal fibroblasts were purchased from Lonza and cultured in fibroblast basal media (ATCC or Lonza) as recommended by the supplier. Human fetal neural progenitors were cultured as previously described33. Cell lines were routinely tested for mycoplasma using a PCR based assay (Vendor GeM Mycoplasma Detection Kit from Sigma Cat.#MP0025\u20131KT). When applicable, cell lines were authenticated with STR analysis using the ATCC Cell Line Authentication service.\n\nGeneration and propagation of the following viruses or replicons have been previously described4,5: yellow fever virus strain 17D expressing Venus GFP (YFV-Venus), hepatitis C virus genotype 2a intragenotypic chimera expressing Ypet GFP (HCV-Ypet), coxsackie B virus expressing GFP (CVB-GFP), Sindbis virus AR86 expressing GFP (SINV-GFP), West Nile virus expressing GFP (WNV-GFP), measles virus Edmonston lineage expressing GFP (MV-GFP), HCV-Gluc replicon (Bi-Gluc-JFH-SG), Zika virus strain PRVABC59 (ZIKV)33. Infectious HCV-Gluc was generated from the infectious clone Jc1FLAG(p7-nsGluc2A) as previously described34. An infectious clone of non-reporter WNV (strain TX02) was kindly provided by I. Frolov and virus was propagated as described above for WNV-GFP. DENV-Fluc with a L52F mutation in NS4B was derived from the pDENV2-IC30P-A and propagated as previously described7. A ZIKV MR766-GFP infectious clone (kindly provided by M. Evans) was used to generate virus as described35. The infectious clone, pACNR-FLYF-17Dx (kindly provided by C. Rice) was used to generate non-reporter YFV-17D. Briefly, the plasmid was linearized with XhoI, and the purified DNA was used as a template for transcription with the mMessage mMachine SP6 Transcription kit (ThermoFisher). RNA was purified with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and electroporated into BHK21-J cells. Virus-containing supernatants were collected, clarified by centrifugation, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Human coronavirus OC43 (ATCC strain VR-1558) was propagated in HCT-8 cells as specified by the ATCC. Viral titers were determined by antibody staining (Millipore MAB9012) and flow cytometry36.\n\nTo generate a C-terminal 3xFLAG-tagged IFI6 variant, pENTR221.IFI6 from the ISG library previously described4 was digested with PstI and XhoI (NEB). Full length IFI6 containing a glycine-serine linker was PCR amplified from pENTR221.IFI6. A 3xFLAG epitope was PCR amplified from pcDNA4/TO/GFP-3xFLAG (kindly provided by Ivan D\u2019Orso). The three fragments were combined with the Gibson Assembly Cloning Kit (New England Biolabs) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions, to give the final pENTR221.IFI6\u20133xFLAG construct. A similar HA-tagged construct was generated by replacing the 3xFLAG epitope with annealed oligos encoding the HA epitope, to generate pENTR221.IFI6-HA.\n\nTo generate a GFP expressing the putative IFI6 signal peptide at its N terminus, full length EGFP was PCR amplified with primers containing SacI or XhoI sites and directionally cloned into a SacI/XhoI-digested pENTR221.IFI6 vector. The resulting plasmid was named pENTR221.IFI6(N32)-EGFP.\n\nTo generate CCL2 with a 1xFLAG tag on the C terminus, pENTR221.CCL2 from the ISG library previously described4 was modified as follows. A DNA fragment containing a 1xFLAG coding sequence flanked by CCL2 homology arms was synthesized and inserted into the pENTR221.CCL2 with the Gibson Assembly Cloning Kit (New England Biolabs) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nTo generate DENV-2K-NS4B-HA, the 2K-NS4B region from pDENV2-IC30P-A was PCR-amplified and cloned into lentiviral expression plasmid, pTRIP.XKB-GFP (gift from C. Rice), replacing the GFP sequence. A similar construct expressing DENV C-prM was generated by PCR.\n\nThe Gateway-compatible lentiviral SCRPSY-DEST plasmid co-expressing TagRFP and a puromycin resistance cassette has been previously described7. A derivative of this plasmid in which TagRFP was replaced with a nuclear-localized TagBFP (Evrogen) was generated and named SCRPSY-DEST-nlsBFP. A second derivative of SCRPSY-DEST, named SCRBBL-DEST, was generated by removing the TagRFP-2A-PuroR cassette and subcloning a PCR amplified blasticidin resistance gene in its place. The previously described pTRIP.CMV.IVSB.ires.TagRFP-DEST vector4 was modified to remove the ires-TagRFP cassette, generating a non-reporter Gateway-compatible lentiviral vector named pTRIP.CMV.IVSB-DEST. Lentiviral expression constructs were generated by combining ENTR and DEST vectors in recombination reaction using LR Clonase II (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. All pENTR constructs were propagated in DH5\u03b1 cells, while lentiviral vectors were grown in DH5\u03b1 or MDS42RecA cells (Scarab Genomics).\n\nTo complement cells that had genomic BiP edited by CRISPR, an overexpression construct of BiP containing 6 silent mutations in the region targeted by BiP CRISPR guide 3 was generated. A synthetic gene fragment of BiP containing silent mutations was cloned into pENTR221-BiP (kindly provided by N. Alto) after digestion with AflII and PmlI restriction enzymes, using Gibson Assembly Cloning Kit (New England Biolabs) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Constructs expressing catalytic mutant versions of guide 3 CRISPR resistant BiP (T37G, E201G, and T229G) were generated using site-directed mutagenesis and verified by sequencing. Oligo sequences used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 2.\n\nLentiviral production and transductions were performed as previously described4. Viral infections for GFP-expressing reporter viruses and for ZIKV were carried out as previously described4,5,33. For non-reporter YFV-17D growth curve, cells were infected with a MOI of 2 in DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS for 1h. Media was aspirated and cells were washed with serum free DMEM four times and replaced with 500\u03bcL of complete DMEM. Virus yields in supernatants were quantified by plaque assay. Studies using HCV subgenomic replicon (Bi-Gluc-JFH[SG]) were carried out as previously described4. The YFV-17D subgenomic replicon YFRP-Rluc (kindly provided by Richard Kuhn), was propagated and used to generate viral RNA as previously described20. Assays to detect YFV-Rluc replicon activity were conducted similar to HCV replicon studies, with detection of intracellular Renilla luciferase using the Renilla Luciferase Assay System (Promega). For interferon-mediated inhibition studies, cells were treated with the indicated dose of human interferon alpha 2a (PBL Assay Science, #11100\u20131) for 4 h or 16 h prior to infection. Infections proceeded for approximately one round of viral replication, and cells were collected for analysis by flow cytometry. For studies in human fetal neural progenitors (hNPs), approximately 100,000 cells per well were plated onto 24-well plates. Two or three days later, cells were transduced with SCRPSY-Empty or SCRPSY-IFI6 lentivirus for 2 days in 1mL of hNP proliferation media. Two days post transduction cells were infected with approximately 0.5 MOI ZIKV (PRVABC59) for 1\u20132 hours. Cells were washed 3X with media and supernatants were collected at 24, 48, 72 hrs. Supernatants were titered by limiting dilution on STAT1\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts, using 4G2 (ATCC# D1\u20134G2\u20134-15) staining as the readout36.\n\nOligos encoding sgRNAs for generating knockout cells using CRISPR-Cas9 were cloned into lentiCRISPRv2 plasmid (a gift from Feng Zhang, Addgene plasmid # 52961) as previously described37,38. Oligo sequences for sgRNAs targeting IFI6, BiP, or non-targeting controls are listed in Supplementary Table 2. LentiCRISPRv2 clones containing guide sequences were sequenced, purified, and used for lentiviral production as described above. For generating heterogeneous knockout cell populations, Huh7.5, A549, or U-2 OS cells were infected with lentiCRISPRv2-derived lentivirus for 48 h, then reseeded into complete DMEM containing 1\u20134ug/mL puromycin for 3 days to select for transduced cells.\n\nSingle-cell clones of Huh7.5 cells targeted for IFI6 knockout via CRISPR could not be propagated. To overcome this limitation, CRISPR-targeted Huh7.5 cells (using sgRNA \u201cBR2\u201d) were diluted with parental Huh7.5 cells at a ratio of 1:2000. Mixed cells were plated at 100 cells/well in 96 well plates. Once confluent, cells were passaged to a 48-well format in the presence of 4 \u03bcg/mL puromycin to kill off non-targeted cells. Surviving populations derived in this manner were propagated and expanded for 6 weeks before cryopreserving stock cultures. Using this strategy, an IFI6-targeted knockout cell line was generated and named \u201cIFI6-KO1\u201d. In another strategy, two distinct guides targeting IFI6 (\u201cg1g2\u201d) were co-expressed, one by lentiCRISPRv2 (blasticidin-selectable) and the other by lentiCRISPRv2 (puromycin-selectable). Double drug selection led to bulk populations of cells, with each cell receiving two independent CRISPR guides targeting IFI6. These were named \u201cIFI6-KO2\u201d cells.\n\nThe following methods were used for cells targeted via the IFI6-KO1 strategy. The day before IFN treatment and infection, 70,000\u2013150,000 cells were plated onto 24-well plates. Cells were pre-treated with serial dilutions of IFN\u03b1 4 h before infection. The IFN-containing media was removed and cells were incubated with 0.5\u20131.0 MOI virus (CVB-GFP, SINV-GFP, YFV-Venus, or WNV-GFP) for 1\u20132h before being brought to volume with complete DMEM. After approximately one viral life cycle, cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry.\n\nThe following methods were used for cells targeted via the IFI6-KO2 strategy. For YFV-Venus infections: 100,000 cells were plated in 24-well plates. Cells were treated 1000 U/mL IFN\u03b1 overnight at time of plating. The next day, cells were infected with 7 MOI of YFV-Venus for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C. Cells were harvested 24 h later for flow cytometry analysis. For HCV infection: 80,000 cells were plated in 24-well plates. Cells were treated with 100 U/mL IFN\u03b1 overnight at time of plating. The next day, cells were infected with approximately 1 MOI of HCV (BiYPetJC1Flag2) for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. Cells were harvested for flow cytometry analysis 48 hours later. For WNV infections: 100,000 cells were plated in 24-well plates. Cells were treated with 1000 U/mL IFN\u03b1 overnight at time of plating. The next day, cells were infected with 0.01 MOI of WNV for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C. Cells were washed 4x with DMEM/3%FBS media. Supernatant was collected at 24, 48, and 72 hours and titered by plaque assay on BHK cells.\n\nThe genome-wide CRISPR screen using the Brunello CRISPR knockout pooled library is described in detail in Supplementary Methods. Briefly, Huh7.5 cells were transduced with the Brunello CRISPR library. Puromycin-selected cell populations were treated with IFN\u03b1 overnight, followed by YFV-Venus infection for 24 h. Venus-positive cells that were no longer sensitive to IFN\u03b1-mediated inhibition were collected by FACS sorting. Genomic DNA was isolated from these cells, and sgRNA sequences were amplified by PCR and deep sequenced. Data were analyzed using the MAGeCK method.39\n\nFor lentiviral transductions, NHDF were plated at approximately 100,000 cells per well onto 6-well plates. The next day, cells were transduced via spinoculation with lentiCRISPRv2 (expressing non-targeting sgRNAs or sgRNAs targeting IFI6) in 2mL of fibroblast basal media at 37\u00b0C for at 800 x g. Two days post transduction cells were pooled and placed under selection with 4\u03bcg/mL of puromycin and 15\u03bcg/ml blasticidin. Three days after selection cells, were plated for experiments or passaged once before plating for experiments. For DENV infections, 100,000 cells per well were plated onto 6-well plates. The next day cells were infected with DENV at an MOI of 2 for 2 hours in 1mL of fibroblast basal media. The supernatant was aspirated and cells were washed four times with 500\u03bcL of media and a 1.5mL media was added back. Forty-eight hours post infection, supernatants were collected and titered by limiting dilution on STAT1\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts as described above. Cell lysates were collected for western blot to detect IFI6 expression. For WNV infections, 40,000\u201380,000 cells per well were plated onto 6-well plates. The next day cells were infected with WNV at an MOI of 0.01 for 1 hour in 1mL of fibroblast basal media. The supernatant was aspirated and cells were washed four times with 500uL of media and a final volume of 1mL was placed on the cells. Supernatant was collected at 24, 48, and 72 h for titering by plaque assay on BHK cells. To detect IFI6 induction by IFN in NHDF, 100,000 cells per well were plated onto 6-well plates (for RNA isolation), or 200,000 cells were plated onto 6 cm dishes (for protein isolation). Cells were treated with IFN at indicated doses for 4 h or 24 h. Cells collected for RNA were processed using the Qiagen RNeasy protocol and IFI6 mRNA was detected RT-qPCR as described above. For protein detection cells were collected, resuspended in lysis buffer and mixed with 1x SDS loading buffer lacking BME. Samples were sonicated but not boiled, and loaded onto Tris-tricine low molecular weight gels and analyzed for IFI6 expression as described above.\n\nOligos encoding an sgRNA near the C terminal coding region of IFI6 were cloned into LentiCRISPRV2 as described above. An IFI6-based donor vector containing homology arms flanking the PAM site by 800bp in both directions and a 3xFLAG sequence was synthesized in a pUC57 backbone (Genewiz). The PAM site codons were altered to avoid re-targeting of the site once DNA repair had occurred. For transfections, 200,000 U2OS were seeded onto 6-well plates in complete DMEM containing 0.1\u03bcM SCR-7, a DNA ligase IV inhibitor (Tocris). The donor vector and LentiCRISPRv2 vector were transfected with X-tremeGENE 9 (Roche) into U-2 OS at a ratio of 2:1 with a final DNA amount of 2 \u03bcg per well. Two days post transfection cells were re-plated in complete DMEM with 1\u03bcg/mL puromycin and 0.1\u03bcM SCR-7 for 24h, then replaced with complete DMEM with 0.1\u03bcM SCR-7 and no puromycin. Cells were maintained for at least one week before use in experiments.\n\nApproximately 20,000 Huh7.5 cells stably expressing IFI6 or an empty vector were plated into 8-well chamber slides. Cells were infected with 1.5 MOI YFV-17D for 1 h. Cells were incubated for 48 h, and following the protocol described above were stained with J2 dsRNA antibody (Scicons, 1:200) and Hoechst stain (ThermoFisher, 1:12,000) and mounted with ProLong Gold (Life Technologies).\n\nmEmerald-Sec61-C-18 was a gift from Michael Davidson (Addgene plasmid # 54249). COS-7 or Huh7.5 stably expressing IFI6 3xFLAG were plated at 5,000 cells per well into 8-well chamber slides. The next day cells were transfected with 75ng/well (Huh7.5) or 20ng/well (COS-7) of mEmerald-Sec61\u03b2, or 75ng/well of pTRIP.Mito.EGFP (kindly provided by C. Rice). Cells were as stained as described above with anti-GFP antibody (Abcam #6556, 1:4000) and FLAG-M2 (Sigma #3165, 1:1000).\n\nU-2 OS cells were plated at 5,000 cells per well onto 8-well chamber slides. The next day, cells were transfected with 75ng/well of mEmerald-Sec61\u03b2 and 6 h post transfection treated with 1000 U/mL of IFN\u03b1. Cells were stained with antibodies against FLAG and GFP as described above.\n\nCOS-7 cells were plated at 5,000 cells per well onto 8-well chamber slides. The next day cells were transfected with 75ng/well of SCRPSY.IFI6(N32)GFP-nlsBFP. Twenty-four hours post transfection cells were stained with antibodies against FLAG and the ER retention KDEL sequence (Enzo #ADI-SPA-827, 1:250).\n\nIFI6\u20133xF-expressing Huh7.5 cells were plated at 5,000 cells per well into 8-well chamber slides. Cells were infected with DENV at MOI of 2 for 2h. Cells were incubated for 48 h and stained with antibodies targeting DENV NS4B (ThermoFisher, 1:200) and FLAG (Sigma, 1:1000). Images were acquired using a Zeiss 880 laser scanning confocal microscope with Airyscan for super resolution capability. Images were deconvolved using AutoQuant X3. Deconvolved images were analyzed for colocalization using Imaris 7.7.2, where a background subtraction was performed, and a threshold for pixel intensity was automatically determined by the software. Pearson values shown indicate the overlap in the automatically determined region of interest (ROI).\n\nApproximately 2 \u00d7 106 Huh7.5 cells stably transduced with SCRPSY.empty or SCRPSY.IFI6 lentivirus were seeded into 10cm2 tissue culture dishes. The next day, cells were mock infected or infected with YFV-17D at 1 MOI. Cells were processed 24 h post-infection for electron microscopy as previously described33. For immunogold labeling, COS-7 cells stably expressing SCRPSY.IFI6-HA were fixed for 30 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Cells were permeabilized with 0.25% saponin in phosphate buffer (PB) for 30 min and blocked with 5% goat serum in 0.01% saponin in PB for 1 h. Cells were then incubated with anti-HA antibody (BioLegend #901501, 1:1000 dilution) overnight at 4\u00b0C. The next day, cells were washed 4 times with PB, followed by incubation with 1.4 nm gold-conjugated fragment antigen-binding (Fab) goat antibodies to mouse IgG (Nanoprobes #7202, 1:100) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing 5 times with PB, cells were further fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde and washed 3 times with PB. After rinsing with water, the immunogold-labeled samples were gold-enhanced for 2.5 min using the gold enhancement kit (Nanoprobes) and washed again with water and 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer. Cells were then post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide and 0.8 % K3[Fe(CN6)] in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer for 1h at room temperature and en bloc stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate. Samples were then dehydrated with increasing concentration of ethanol, infiltrated with Embed-812 resin and polymerized in a 60\u00b0C oven overnight. Blocks were sectioned with a diamond knife (Diatome) on a Leica Ultracut UCT (7) ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems) and collected onto copper grids. Images were acquired on a Tecnai G2 spirit transmission electron microscope (FEI) equipped with a LaB6 source using a voltage of 120 kV.\n\nFor gene expression assays, total RNA was isolated from cells stably expressing IFI6, or alternatively, after treatment with 0 or 100 U/mL IFN\u03b1. RNA was isolated using a RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). 50 ng total RNA was analyzed by RT-qPCR using QuantiFast SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). Commercially available QuantiTect Primers specific for IFI27, IFI27L1, IFI27L2, IRF1, IFITM3, RSAD2, IFIT1, HSPA5, and RPS11 housekeeping control (Qiagen) were used according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Lab-generated IFI6 and OAS2 primer sets were also used (Supplementary Table 2). Reactions were run on an ABI7500 Fast Real Time PCR System and gene expression was calculated using the \u0394\u0394CT method.\n\nGene expression analysis by RNA-Seq was performed as previously described40. RNA-Seq data has been deposited to NCBI GEO with accession number GSE105771.\n\nFor protein expression assays, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer [25mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 1X Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche)] or NP-40 lysis buffer [50mM Tris, pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 1X Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail] to obtain a post nuclear lysate.. Protein concentration of cell lysates was determined by Bradford Assay (Pierce). Alternatively, cell pellets were directly boiled in 2X SDS-PAGE sample buffer (100mM Tris, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 2% BME, 0.1% Bromophenol Blue), or 2X Tricine sample buffer (200 mM Tris-HCl pH6.8, 40% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.04% Coomassie blue). Lysates were separated on 12% polyacrylamide gels using the Laemmli method. For endogenous IFI6 detection, 10% Tris-Tricine gels were used. Proteins were blotted to PVDF membrane (BioRad), and processed for western blotting. Blots were blocked overnight in 3% or 5% milk in 1X TBS-T (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20), followed by incubation with primary and secondary antibodies for 1 h and 30 minutes, respectively. Proteins were visualized by incubating blots with enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (ECL, Pierce) and exposing blots to autoradiography film (Denville Scientific). Antibodies used in the study include: anti-FLAG M2 (F3165 Sigma), anti-FLAG polyclonal (Sigma #F7425), anti-beta Actin (ab6276 Abcam), anti-BiP (ThermoFisher PA5\u201334941), anti-calnexin (Enzo Life Sciences #ADI-SPA-860-D), anti-KDEL (Enzo Life Science #ADI-SPA-827D), anti-RFP (AB233 Evrogen), anti-DENV NS4A (GTX132069 GeneTex), anti-NS1 (gift from M. Diamond), rabbit IgG control (ab27478 Abcam), mouse IgG control (ab81032 Abcam), goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and goat anti-mouse HRP (Pierce). For detection of endogenous IFI6, a rabbit polyclonal antibody was custom generated by ProSci, Inc. The antigen consisted of a peptide corresponding to the C terminus of IFI6 (LMGYATHKYLDSEED) and containing an N terminal cysteine to assist in conjugation to the carrier protein. Antibody was further isolated by immuno-affinity purification of the serum.\n\nHuh7.5 cells stably expressing IFI6\u20133xFLAG were collected from confluent 15cm2 tissue culture dishes and resuspended in 2mL of cold 0.25M sucrose. Cells were lysed in a 2mL tight fitting Dounce homogenizer with 200 strokes on ice to yield approximately 90% lysis. The lysate was centrifuged at 2,500 x g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C to pellet debris. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and pelleted at 20,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C to pellet membranes. Pellets were resuspended in 2mL PBS, PBS with 1M NaCl, PBS with 0.1M Na2CO3 (pH 11.5), or PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100 and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. The samples were mixed with 2mL of cold 60% Histodenz (Sigma) and transferred to an ultracentrifuge tube (Beckman Coulter Ultra-Clear 14\u00d795mm). To avoid mixing, the sample was overlaid with gentle pipetting of 4mL of cold 20% Histodenz in PBS/Sucrose, and finally with 4mL of cold 10% Histodenz in PBS/Sucrose. Additional 10% Histodenz in PBS/Sucrose was used to bring the tube volume to ~1mm from the rim of the tube. Alternatively, in some experiments, samples were loaded onto an iodixanol (Sigma) gradient. Samples were centrifuged at 35,000rpm (~209,000 x g) in a SW40Ti rotor for 16 h. Samples were collected in 1mL fractions from the top of the tube and mixed with 1mL 2x SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer. 20\u03bcL aliquots were analyzed by western blot with anti-FLAG, anti-calnexin, or anti-RFP antibodies as described above.\n\nApproximately 1.5\u00d7106 Huh7.5 cells stably expressing IFI6\u20133xFLAG were collected for each condition and pelleted. Cells were resuspended and lysed gently at 4\u00b0C with nutation for 15 minutes in 250\u03bcL of a buffer containing 20mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1.5mM MgCl2, 150mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 5% glycerol, and 1 protease inhibitor pellet (Roche) per 10mL of solution. When used, ATP was included at a final concentration of 2mM (Sigma #A6559). Cells were then pelleted at 16,000xg for 8 minutes at 4\u00b0C. An affinity gel containing 4% agarose beads with FLAG-M2 antibody covalently bound (Sigma #F2426) was equilibrated in washing buffer (20mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 250mM NaCl, 0.2% NP-40, 1.5mM MgCl2, 5% glycerol). 5\u201310% of cleared lysate was collected as inputs and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. The remaining lysate was added to the beads and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C on a rotator. The next morning, the supernatant was collected and beads were washed four times with washing buffer. A 3xFLAG peptide (Sigma #4799) was used to elute bound products off the column at 4\u00b0C with constant vortexing for one hour. Input samples and eluted products were run on a SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane, which was probed with antibodies against BiP or FLAG (rabbit polyclonal).\n\n293T cells plated at 400,000 cells per well in 6-well plates were transfected with pTRIP.CMV.IVSB-CCL2\u20131xFLAG or pTRIP.CMV.IVSB-IFI6\u20133xFLAG plasmids using X-tremeGENE 9 (Roche). The next day, media was removed and 1 ml Optimem (Gibco) with or without 1\u03bcg/mL BrefeldinA was added to cells. After 5 h, supernatants were removed and proteins precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Cells were harvested with Accumax and post-nuclear cell lysates were analyzed by western blot with anti-FLAG or anti-actin antibodies as described above.\n\n293T, 293T Control sgRNA, or 293T SPCS1-KO cells (latter two kindly provided by M. Diamond) were plated at 400,000 cells per well in 6-well plates. As indicated, cells were transfected with pTRIP.XKB-2K-NS4B-HA, pTRIP.XKB-C-prM-HA, pTRIP.CMV.IVSB-IFI6\u20133xFLAG, pTRIP.CMV.IVSB-GFP-1xFLAG, pQCXIP-DENV-NS2B-NS3 (WT or S135A, gifts from M. Gack), and MRX-HA-STING (gift from N. Yan) plasmids using X-tremeGENE 9 (Roche). The next day, cells were harvested with Accumax and post-nuclear cell lysates were analyzed by western blot with anti-FLAG, anti-HA or anti-actin antibodies as described above.\n\nStatistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism software. In all figures, data points and bar graphs represent the mean of independent biological replicates. In all graphs, error bars represent standard deviation and are only shown for experiments with n=3 or greater. In bar graphs, individual data points are overlaid. The genome wide-CRISPR screen was performed once (n=1) at 900X library coverage (Fig 1b). Western blots are representative of multiple biological replicates showing similar results, as follows: IFN-induced IFI6 expression in Huh7.5 cells, n=3 (Fig 1e); IFI6 and actin expression in WNV-infected Huh7.5 cells, n=2 (Fig 1g); IFN-induced IFI6 expression in NHDF, n=4 (Fig 1n), DENV-induced IFI6 expression in NHDF, n=6 (Fig 1o); IFI6 and BiP protein levels after IFN treatment in Huh7.5 cells, n=3 (Fig 2a and Supplementary Fig 1a); effect of BiP depletion on IFI6 levels, n=3 (Fig 2e); rescue of IFI6 expression by proteasome inhibition, n=3 (Fig 2f); effect of ATPase defective BiP mutants on IFI6 expression, n=3 (Fig 2g); BiP immunoprecipitation, n=3 (Fig 2h); endogenous IFI6\u20133xFLAG expression in gene-tagged U2OS cells, n=2 (Fig 2i); membrane flotation assay, n=2 (Fig 3f and Supplementary Fig 4e); secretion assay, n=2 (Fig 3g); IFI6 time of addition experiment, n=3 (Fig 4e); polyprotein processing, n=2 (Supplementary Figure 6a, 6b), n=3 (Supplementary Figure 6c). Uncropped blots are presented in Supplementary Figure 9. Microscopy-based data are representative of multiple biological replicates showing similar results, as follows: proximity ligation assay, n=3 (Fig 2j and Supplementary Figure 4a); immunofluorescence microscopy, n=3 (Fig 3a, 3d, 4f, Supplementary Fig 8) or n=2 (Fig 3b, 4c); electron microscopy, n=3 (Fig 4b). One of the three electron microscopy experiments was blinded before analysis. Microscopy data in Fig 3c and 3e represent multiple field of view from one biological replicate.\n\nThe datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon request."}
