{"title": "Environmental Engineers and Scientists Have Important Roles to\nPlay in Stemming Outbreaks and Pandemics Caused by Enveloped\nViruses", "body": "Environmental engineers and scientists have played pivotal roles in protecting the\npublic from viral illnesses, and continue to do so today. We develop drinking\nwater and municipal wastewater treatment technologies, make discoveries that\ninform related regulations and policies, and conduct critical research on the\npresence, persistence, and transport of viruses in the environment. A wide range\nof impactful research in our field has focused mainly on nonenveloped human\nenteric viruses such as human noroviruses and enteroviruses. More recently, a\nnumber of high-profile outbreaks such as Ebola virus, measles, Zika virus, avian\ninfluenzas, SARS, MERS, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have been caused by\nenveloped viruses. In addition to the RNA or DNA genomes and protective protein\ncapsids that are common to all viruses, enveloped virus structures are also\nwrapped in bilipid membranes.\n\nThe primary mode of transmission for many enveloped viruses is by close contact with\ninfected individuals. Some enveloped viruses, however, are released to the\nenvironment by the host and persist on surfaces (i.e., fomites), in the air, or in\nwater, long enough to come into contact with another host for further onward\ntransmission (i.e., indirect transmission). This includes viruses responsible for\ninfluenza and measles. The primary transmission routes for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus\nthat causes COVID-19) are believed to be person-to-person contact and by exposure\nto large droplets produced from sneezing, coughing or talking, but indirect\ntransmission routes may also play a role.1 This potential role\nof the environment in the spread of COVID-19 highlights the multitude of applied\nresearch needs that must be addressed to effectively control outbreaks and\npandemics as novel enveloped viruses emerge. Environmental engineers and\nscientists are well positioned to apply their unique skill sets and experience\nwith interdisciplinary research to address these needs.\n\nVirus particles in the air and on fomites are exposed to a range of environmental\nconditions that influence their persistence. Relative humidity, fomite material,\nand air temperature can greatly impact enveloped virus inactivation\nrates.2\u22125 Even the medium in which the\nvirus is suspended can greatly impact persistence.6 For\nexample, chlorine-based solutions and hydrogen peroxide gas are effective at\ninactivating the enveloped virus surrogate Phi6 on fomites,7,8 but the presence of\nblood requires much higher hydrogen peroxide gas doses.8 Future\nmechanistic studies should probe how specific constituents in the matrix,\ntemperature, humidity, and solar radiation each impact inactivation. Furthermore,\nresearch quantifying the transfer of enveloped viruses between fomites and skin,\nand determining effective hand washing and surface sanitizing methods, is needed\nto inform agent-based risk assessment models.\n\nViruses have a direct connection to wastewater and drinking water purification when\nthey are excreted in feces or urine (Table 1),9 but there is limited data on the\nconcentration of enveloped viruses in feces and urine. The human coronavirus\nresponsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak was able to replicate in the human GI tract\nand infective particles were detected in stool samples.10 In\nfact, aerosolized fecal particles are believed to have played a major role in\nspreading the virus at a Hong Kong apartment complex.11\nSimilarly, SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA has been detected in feces.12,13 Although infective\nSARS-CoV-2 has not yet been confirmed in stool samples, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA\nshedding pattern suggests viruses are replicating in the GI tract.13 Other human enveloped viruses, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV),\nare excreted in urine. Research so far on enveloped viruses in wastewater,\nincluding coronaviruses, suggest these viruses are inactivated at faster rates\nthan most nonenveloped viruses,14\u221218 that they partition to\nwastewater solids to a greater extent than nonenveloped viruses,15 and that wastewater temperature is positively associated with\ntheir inactivation rates.15,18 In water purification processes, they are generally more\nsusceptible to oxidant disinfectants than nonenveloped\nviruses.19,20 The presence of an envelope does not appear to impact\nvirus susceptibility to ultraviolet C (UVC) light,15 likely\nbecause UVC targets virus genomes and lipid membranes do not shield the genomes\nfrom UVC radiation.\n\nWhat does this mean for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the ability of our water\npurification plants to produce safe water? Our drinking water treatment plants,\nincluding those used to produce drinking water from wastewater, were designed\nusing microbial risk assessments and process performance data with nonenveloped\nenteric viruses. Based on the facts that (1) the closely related 2003 SARS was\nexcreted in feces at lower levels than enteric human noroviruses (Table 1), (2) model coronaviruses are inactivated\nat faster rates in wastewater and other waters than nonenveloped viruses, (3) the\nenveloped viruses studied to-date are more susceptible to oxidant disinfectants\nthan nonenveloped viruses, and (4) the large single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome\n(\u223c29.8 kb) of SARS-CoV-2 likely renders it more susceptible to UVC\ninactivation than enteric ssRNA viruses, the multibarrier wastewater and drinking\nwater treatment systems are likely effective in protecting against SARS-CoV-2.\nNonetheless, there may still be water-related exposures that need to be considered\nif infectious SARS-CoV-2 viruses are present in urine or feces. Such exposures may\noccur in communities that experience combined sewage overflows, that do not have\nsewage infrastructure, or that use wastewater for irrigation, as well as buildings\nthat have faulty plumbing systems and occupational exposures to wastewater and\nexcrement.\n\nDespite the research outlined above, enveloped viruses are extremely diverse, with a\nrange of genome types, structures, replication cycles, and pathogenicities. For\nexample, of the 158 identified human RNA viruses species as of 2018, 122 species\nfrom 11 virus families were enveloped and 36 species from 6 families were\nnonenveloped.25 Consequently, enveloped viruses likely\ndisplay a diverse range of environmental behavior, persistence, and fate.26 The limited studies on enveloped-virus fate, transport, and\ninactivation have focused on only a small fraction of human viruses or their\nproxies including animal coronaviruses and bacteriophage phi6. Although studies\nusing animal coronaviruses have been valuable for the current COVID-19\noutbreak,3,15,27 it is essential to consider an\nexpanded set of enveloped viruses that better represent human enveloped virus\ndiversity.\n\nFuture studies on enveloped viruses should seek to carefully characterize and even\nstandardize the conditions under which measurements are conducted. Media\ncomposition, the purity of virus stock, and when possible, virus concentrations in\nboth gene copies and infective units, should be described. When studying oxidants,\nthe demand of the solution and change in oxidant concentration through the\nexperiment should be provided. When studying radiation (UVC and/or sunlight),\nattenuation through the experimental solution should be well-characterized\nincorporated into reported doses. Researchers should include a well-studied\nsurrogate virus in their experiments in addition to the enveloped virus of\ninterest to facilitate cross-study comparisons. We recommend using the\nnonenveloped bacteriophage MS2 for this purpose, as it is one of the most studied\nviruses in environmental systems.\n\nFinally, there are emerging research areas in our field that we believe can inform\nthe current COVID-19 outbreak and future novel viral outbreaks. For example,\npredictive models based on the underlying mechanisms controlling the persistence\nof enveloped viruses, and other characteristics, may reduce the need to study\nevery virus under every condition.14 Another promising area of\nresearch involves using sewage to monitor virus circulation in communities and\ndetect outbreaks before clinical cases are identified. Recently applied to\npathogenic bacteria28 and nonenveloped viruses,29 this will necessitate a better understanding of which\nenveloped viruses are excreted in urine and feces and at what levels.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 will certainly not be the last novel virus to emerge and seriously\nthreaten global public health. Researchers and funding agencies have a tendency to\nfocus intensely on a specific virus during its outbreak, but then move on to other\ntopics when the outbreak subsides. Given the historical contributions from our\nfield, and the grand challenges that lie ahead,30 environmental\nscience and engineering researchers should take a broader, long-term, and more\nquantitative approach to understanding viruses that are spread through the\nenvironment. Similar to how we approach chemical pollutants in the environment, we\nshould aim to understand and communicate to our colleagues in medicine and public\nhealth the specific characteristics that drive transport and inactivation of\nenveloped viruses in solutions, on surfaces, and in the air. Likewise, we should\nseek to understand how environmental factors shape possible virus transmission\nroutes. That way, regardless of the identity of the enveloped virus that causes\nthe next major outbreak, we can provide more informed descriptions of its\npersistence and recommendations on how to mitigate its spread."}
