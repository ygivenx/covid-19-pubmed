We used 140 mL porcelain dishes (Fisher Scientific) that measured 8.1 cm in diameter across the top, 6.0 cm across the bottom, and 4.5 cm tall. We purchased polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe caps measuring 6.2 cm in diameter and 4.0 cm tall, with an interior surface area of 108 cm2, from a local hardware store. The autoclavable polypropylene jars (McMaster-Carr) had a capacity of 125 mL each and measured 7.0 cm in diameter and 6.0 cm tall. We fabricated concrete bowls from type I/II Portland cement, natural sand (passes #4, 4.76-mm sieve) as the fine aggregate, silica sand (mostly retained on #10, 2-mm sieve) as the coarse aggregate, and water reducer (Sika Plastocrete 161). The bowls measured 9.6 cm in diameter across the top, 7.4 cm across the bottom, and 2.4 cm tall. We allowed the bowls to cure for one month and applied an acrylic sealant (Quikrete 8730-02) before use.\n\nPrior to each experiment, we cleaned all containers with ultrapure water, ethanol, and RNase Away and DNA Away (Thermo Scientific), and we autoclaved the porcelain, concrete and polypropylene bowls. PVC cannot be autoclaved, so we used new PVC pipe caps for each experiment. using autoclaved, ultrapure water as a sample blank, in clean/autoclaved containers. We analyzed sample blanks by RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and qPCR analysis as previously detailed.\n\nThere was no amplification in the sample blanks after 35 PCR cycles.\n\nWe investigated the potential for RNA and DNA contamination from all stock solutions, working fluids, and bacterial and viral stocks, individually, using the previously described RNA extraction and cDNA conversion methods. We sequenced the samples to verify specificity of primers and probes for each bacteriophage. We amplified the converted cDNA samples using the previously specified qPCR reaction mixtures and volumes (intercalating dye or probe-based method), with a modified PCR machine protocol that omitted the final melt curve temperature ramp. We immediately removed amplified products from the PCR machine and further processed them or stored them at 4 \u00b0C for no more than 2 h before further processing. We analyzed aliquots of amplified PCR products by gel electrophoresis to verify base pair length and check for DNA carry over. We measured DNA concentration (Qubit fluorometer (Invitogen)) to determine volume of amplification product required for Sanger sequencing. We then cleaned amplified products by enzymatic treatment in sterile, optically clear vials, using Affymetrix ExoSAP-IT\u00ae, and incubated according to product recommendations on a Bio-Rad thermocycler.\n\nWe submitted enzymatically cleaned, amplified samples, and primer and probe aliquots, to the Virginia Tech Biocomplexity Institute Genomics Research Institute for Sanger sequencing. We evaluated resulting chromographs using 4Peak ABI chromatogram freeware and identified DNA sequences by NCBI Nucleotide BLAST. Detectable background concentrations of bacteriophages in working fluids and bacterial stock solutions were at least four orders of magnitude below experimental sample concentrations. "}
