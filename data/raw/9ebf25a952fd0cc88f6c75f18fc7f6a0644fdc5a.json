{"title": "", "body": "In order to examine alterations in neurotransmitter metabolism associated with HSV-1 infection, we have studied infection of the PC12 cell line, which is derived from a rat pheochromocytoma and responds to nerve growth factor by undergoing narphological and physiological \"differentiation\".\n\nThese cells possess both adrenergic and cholinergic properties. We have found that activities of both acetylcholinesterase and choline acetyltransferase were rapidly and progressively depressed during the replication cycle. Studies with metabolic inhibitors and temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants suggested that this decline in enzyme activities was associated with events occurring early in replication, likely related to expression of the i~ediate-early (a ) group of viral polypeptides.\n\nIn contrast, catecholamine uptake, content, and K\"-stimulated release were al? preserved nearly intact during a 24-hr period of productive infection.\n\nTyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity underwent a more complex pattern of alteration with an initial depression of activity reaching a nadir at 6 hr post inoculation, but recovered rapidly with a return to baseline by 8-9 hr. Subsequently, TH activity again fell with a second, more variable rise occurring at 24 hr post inoculation.\n\nThese Also, evidence suggests that T cells sensitized to myelin play a pathogenetic role in the demyelinating process.\n\nTo analyze the complex features of this disease, primary glial cell cultures consisting of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes are being utilized to determine direct viruscell interactions.\n\nCultures prepared from newborn Lewis rat brain are maintained for at least 2 months.\n\n(PI) all three strains infect astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.\n\nThe persistent nature of neurotropic TS43 in culture may reflect the delayed mechanism of primary demyelination in rat brain. This system will allow a detailed analysis of the effect of viral persistence upon specialized glial functions including myelin maintenance.\n\nParamyxovirus induced changes of e-adrenergic receptor response and its immunological modulation K. Koschel Institute of Virology and Immunology, University of Wiirzburg, Versbacher Str. 7, D-8700 Wurzburg, FRG .\n\nIt was shown where such impairments are located in the molecular organization of different receptorladenylate cyclase systems (e -adren., PGE, -and opiate receptors) on neuron-like (NG108-15) and glia-like (C6) cell lines.\n\nAn example is the rat glioma C6 cell persistently infected by measles-SSPE virus which show impaired B-receptor mediated CAMP synthesis caused by viral glycoproteins in the cell membrane.\n\nThe effect of antiviral antibodies on the expression of viral proteins in respect to the impairment was studied (8) . Results show that such virus induced dysfunctions of CNS cells may be involved in certain CNS diseases. This work is supported by the DFG (Sonderforschungsbereich 105, C3)."}
