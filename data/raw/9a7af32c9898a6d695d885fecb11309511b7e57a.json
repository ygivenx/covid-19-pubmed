Tingle, Gerald T. Nepom, Martial Lacroix, and Maan Zrein ABSTRACT: A CTL antigenic site located between residues 273 and 291 of the E1 envelope protein of RV was identified by 51Cr_release assays employing SPs. Two E 1specific CTL clones were examined for immune recognition of RV wild-type and attenuated vaccine strains and recombinant E1 protein. The exact sequence (273-284) recognized by both clones was delineated by using truncated and overlapping SPs covering these residues. The defined T-cell site overlapped almost completely with a virus neutralizing antibody-binding site previously identified with mouse monoclonal and human antibodies. A series of single aa-substituted SP analogues of E1(273-284) was used to define residues critical for T-cell recognition. Using EBV-BL displaying different HLA-DR haplotypes and -DR4 subtypes as targets to determine MHC class II restriction elements, immune recognition by both T-cell clones was shown to be associated with HLA-DR4. Three HLA-DR4 subtypes (DR4Dw13A, DR4Dw13B, and DR4KT2) sharing a common residue, glutamic acid at position 74 in their ~ 1 chains, were able to present SP E1(273-284) to the T-cell clones. Human Immunology 39, 177-187 (1994) [1] . Live attenuated RV vaccines, which have been used since 1969 to immunize infants and susceptible women of childbearing age, have successfully reduced disease incidence [2] . Nevertheless, 177 0198-8859/94/$7.00 there are still medical concerns such as primary or secondary vaccine failure and RV vaccine-associated arthritis (RAA). RAA occurs acutely in approximately 10%-15% of previously seronegative women receiving the currently used live attenuated RA27/3 strain of RV vaccine [3] . Of those affected, a significant proportion have been reported to develop chronic and debilitating joint manifestations [1, 3, 4] . Whether this is due to primary immunologic failure leading to RV persistence in joint tissues [5] or virus-induced autoimmunity is still unresolved. Hence, there is an indication for the development of an improved second-generation (peptide, recombinant protein, or modified infectious virus) vaccine by employing only those antigenic regions known to give rise to protective immunity.\n\nIn determining the components of a new RV subunit vaccine, it is essential to establish the relevant antigenic sites for RV-specific effector T lymphocytes and protective antibodies [6] . Evidence from other virus studies has indicated a central role for CD4 + T cells in the induction of specific immune responses to virus antigens (Ags) as represented in synthetic peptides (SPs) [7, 8t . It is also known that CD4 + T cells recognize foreign Ags not in their native form but as small peptides that are presented as a complex with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules on the surface of Ag-presenting cells [9] . Hence, identification of relevant antigenic sites by using SPs representative of the primary sequence of a candidate vaccine Ag, and characterization of the HLA restriction elements involved in peptide presentation to T cells, could facilitate design of a more effective RV vaccine [ 10] .\n\nRV contains three major antigens: the envelope glycoproteins (El and E2) and an internal capsid protein [11, 12] . Four nonoverlapping domains that are binding sites for RV-neutralizing antibodies have been located within residues 213-285 on E1 [12, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . At least four T-cell antigenic sites within this sequence have also been mapped by using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) or CD4 + T-cell lines in lymphoproliferation screening assays employing relatively long (16-33 aa) SPs [14, [19] [20] [21] .\n\nTo delineate further the antigenic sites recognized by T and B cells within this E1 region, T-cell lines were derived from RV-reactive human donors by either stimulating freshly isolated PBMNCs with UV-inactivated RV (M33 strain) or by stimulating PBMNCs directly with SPs (19-27 aa long) spanning residues 213-291 of RV E 1 protein. From these initial studies, several cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clones were isolated by limiting dilution [22, 23] , and their specificities were determined in standard 51Cr_release assays, using autologous Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell lines (EBV-BLs) sensitized with SPs as targets. Two T-cell clones   were selected for this study: ATRVC2, isolated from a  T-cell line stimulated by UV-inactivated RV; and  AT177C5, derived from a T-cell line stimulated by the  SP E1(273-291 ). Preliminary investigations revealed that both were specific for an antigenic site (or sites) lying within residues (273-291) of RV E1 protein, a domain previously shown to be the target of RVneutralizing antibodies [15, 17] . These findings suggested that this region might contain overlapping T-and B-cell antigenic sites that could be potentially useful components of a modified RV vaccine. To understand better the role this antigenic region plays in protective immunity and in the interaction between T and B cells, the exact antigenic sites recognized by each clone and the MHC class II restriction elements involved in their presentation were defined.\n\nVirus and E1 protein. RV strains M33, RA27/3, and HPV77 were grown in Vero cells and isolated from culture supernatants. Virus stocks were titrated by immunocytochemical focus assays as described previously [23] . Stock solutions containing 5 \u00d7 107 focus-forming units (FFU)/ml were inactivated by UV light (254 nm, model UVG-54; UV Products, San Gabriel, CA, USA) at 5 cm for 10 minutes before use. Recombinant RV E 1 protein (rE 1BV), which was isolated from the culture supernatant of the insect cell line SF9 transformed by recombinant rubella E 1 baculovirus, was generously provided by Dr. Shirley Gillam (Department of Pathology, University of British Columbia).\n\nPeptide synthesis. Overlapping SPs (5-24 aa long) encompassing residues 268-291 of E1 protein of RV strain M33 [11] and substituted analogues within the E1 sequence 273-284 were synthesized in an automated peptide synthesizer using established solid-phase methods and purified to 95% homogeneity in reverse-phase highpressure liquid chromatography by BioChem Immunosystems (Laval, Quebec). Amino acid analyses were performed on each peptide and found to be in good agreement with the theoretical composition.\n\nThe T-cell clones (ATRVC2 and AT177C5) used for this study were isolated from two CD4+CD8\n\nT-cell lines derived from a single RVseropositive donor as described previously [22, 24, 25] . Briefly, PBMNCs were incubated with UV-inactivated RV (5 \u00d7 105 FFU/ml) or the SP E1(273-291), which was used at a final concentration of 15 ~g/ml in complete RPMI-1640 medium containing 2 mM L-glutamine, 25 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid (Hepes), 50 mM penicillin, 50 mM streptomycin, and 5 \u00d7 10 -5 M 2-mercaptoethanol, which was also supplemented with 10% autologous plasma. After 7 days of incubation at 37\u00b0C, the cells were washed three times and resuspended at 106 cells/ml in complete RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco, Missisauga, Ontario, Canada) and 25 U of human recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL2, Gibco) per milliliter. After 7 days of incubation, RV-or SP-reactive lymphocytes were cloned by limiting dilution in 96-well round-bottom plates (Nunc, Denmark) at an initial density of 0.3 cells per well in the presence of UV-inactivated RV (5 \u00d7 105 FFU/ml) or SP (15 ~g/ml) with 5% Lymphocult-T-LF (Biotest, Germany), 25 U/ml of rIL2, and ~/-irradiated (2500 rad) autologous PBMNCs (5 x 104/well). After 7 days, all of the wells were supplemented with complete RPMI medium containing 5% Lymphocult-T-LF and 50 U/ml rIL2. By days 10-12, clones were visible. Each clone was transferred into fresh medium and distributed to three wells of 96-well flat-bottomed plates. After 5-7 days of incubation, cells originating from each clone were pooled and transferred into a single well of a four-well plate (Nunc) and restimulated with UV-inactivated RV or SP E1(273-291) in the presence of ~/-irradiated autologous PBMNCs. At this time, their Ag specificity was determined in 51Cr-release assays, using autologous EBVtransformed B cells sensitized with the SP E1(273-291) as targets as described below. T-cell clones were maintained in culture by stimulating at weekly intervals 2 \u00d7 105 T cells with UV-inactivated RV (5 \u00d7 105 FFU/ml) or SP E1 (273-291) at a concentration 15 ~g/ml in the presence of 1 \u00d7 106 autologous, ~/-irradiated PBMNCs. Cultures were replenished every 3-5 days with complete medium containing IL2 at the concentrations described above.\n\nEBV-BLs were used as targets in 51Cr-release assays. EBV-BLs AT (autologous to T-cell clones ATRVC2 and AT177C5) and MT, AJ, CM, LM, OZ, DO, and P9B were established in our laboratories from donors with different heterozygous HLA phenotypes (see Tables 3  and 5 ) as described previously [22, 23] . HCLs, EBV-BLs BSM, YAR, JHa, PF, KB, HOM2, MAT, CRI, Ig-38, MST, SST, and KT2, which are homozygous at the HLA region, with different HLA-DR phenotypes or DR4 subtypes (Tables 4 and 5 Cell-mediated cytotoxicity assay. A standard 51Cr-release assay was used to measure CTL responses [22, 23, 25] . For use as CTL targets, EBV-BL or HCL cells (1 \u00d7 106) were sensitized by overnight incubation at 37\u00b0C with 1 \u00d7 106 FFU of UV-inactivated RV, or 5 I-~g/ml rE 1BV, or 10 gtM of SP in 1 ml of complete RPMI medium. For assays employing only SPs, incubation time was reduced to 1 hour. After Ag sensitization, cells were washed once with complete medium and labeled with 100 ~Ci of NA251CRO4 (Amersham, Oakville, Ontario, Canada) for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. Radiolabeled target cells were washed four times with medium and incubated with T cells'at different effector-target ratios for 4 hours in roundbottom 96-well plates (Nunc). All assays were performed in duplicate or triplicate. Percent specific cytotoxicity was calculated by the formula 100 [(ER -SR)/(MR -SR)], where ER (experimental 51Cr release) = mean counts per minute (cpm) released into the supernatant in the presence of T cells using 5 \u00d7 103 target cells; SR (spontaneous 51Cr release) = mean cpm in the absence of T cells determined in four replicate samples; and MR (maximal 51Cr release) = mean cpm in supernatant of target cells incubated with 0.5% Nonidet-P40 detergent (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) determined in four replicates. SR was always ~25% of MR.\n\nmAbs. Anti-DR monoclonal antibody (mAb) P4.1 [26] and anti-DQ mAb 200.1 [27] were also provided by G.T.N. Ascites fluids containing these mAbs were used to inhibit CTL responses in 51Cr_release assays by incubating SP E1(273-284)-sensitized target cells at final dilutions of 1:200 for 30 minutes before adding CTL cells.\n\nPolymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) and sequence analysis. One microgram of genomic DNA from EBV-BL AT was amplified by PCR, using DR4 group-specific primers BN17 (5~-CCGGAACCTCTTGGAGCAGGTTAAACA-3P) and BN22 (5' -CGTTCGAATGCACTGTGAAGCTCTC-3 r) with 1-minute cycle times and a 94 \u00b0, 65 \u00b0, and 72\u00b0C temperature cycle. The PCR product was directly sequenced by the dideoxy-chain termination method using Taq polymerase and the BN22 oligonucleotide as the primer.\n\nImmune recognition of E1 SPs, rEIBV, and RV strains M33, RA27/3, and HPV77 by cytotoxic T-cell clones. T-cell clones ATRVC2 and AT177C5 were determined to be CD4\u00f7CD8-T cells by flow-cytometric analysis (data not shown). Both clones were tested in cytotoxicity assays for recognition of recombinant E1 protein, wildtype RV (M33) and attenuated RV vaccine strains (RA27/3 and HPV77). Both clones exhibited strong cytotoxicity for autologous EBV-BL targets sensitized with the SP E1(273-291) and, to a lesser extent, also killed the same targets sensitized with rE IBV or the three strains of UV-inactivated whole RV ( Fig. 1 and Table 1 ).\n\nIn the latter case, the weakest cytotoxicity was observed with the RA27/3 vaccine strain (Fig. l) .\n\nEl-specific CTL clones. To identify the exact antigenic site recognized by CTL clones ATRVC2 and AT177C5, were also found to elicit lower cytotoxicity than the natural sequence ( Fig. 2 and Table 2 ). Charge substitutions, however, such as glutamic (E) or aspartic (D) acids for tryptophan (W) at position 275, or for valine (V) at position 279 or for isoleucine (I) at position 280 or for glutamine (Q) at position 283, or substitution of nonpolar or relatively larger residues such as tyrosine (Y) or tryptophan (W) for T at position 277, or for S at position 282, completely abolished the specific cytotoxicity ( Fig.  2 and Table 2 ).\n\nshown to be CD4 + CTLs, HLA class II restriction elements associated with the immune recognition of the antigenic site defined above were determined, mAbs (P4.1 and 200.1) specific for determinants on HLA-DR and -DQ, respectively, were tested in 51Cr_release assays for their abilities to block the presentation ofSP E 1(273-284) by the autologous EBV-BL, AT. SP-specific killing mediated by clones ATRVC2 and AT177C5 was inhibited by preincubating SP-sensitized targets with anti-HLA-DR mAb P4.1 but not by anti-HLA-DQ mAb 200.1 (Fig. 3) , suggesting that an HLA-DR restriction (Tables 3 and 4 ) as targets in cytotoxicity assays. Results showed that the antigenic site defined for the T-cell clones was recognized only in the context of HLA-DR4, which was the phenotype of the autologous EBV-BL, AT, and was also shared by the heterologous line, MT (Table 3) , and homologous line, JHa (Table 4 ). Other heterologous EBV-BLs expressing HLA-DR4 (lines AJ and CM, whose data are shown in Table 3 ) were unable to present E1(273-284) to the T-cell clones suggesting that, in this case, immune recognition was likely to be DR4 subtype specific. By using HCLs and EBV-BL with different HLA-DR4 subtypes sensitized with E1(273-284) as targets in cytotoxicity assays, it was determined that only three HCIs--SST(DR4Dw13A), JHa(DR4Dwl3B), and KT2(DR4KT2)--could present E1(273-284) to clones ATRVC2 and AT177C5 (Table 5) . Effector/Target Ratio \n\nTwo RV-specific HLA-DR-restricted, CD4+CD8 -CTL clones, ATRVC2 and AT177C5, were generated from the PBMNCs of a single HLA-DR4/DR7 subject by in vitro stimulation with either UV-inactivated M33 strain RV (ATRVC2) or the SP E1(273-291) (AT177C5). Both showed identical antigenic specificity for E 1(273-284) and behaved as cytotoxic T cells. If this phenotype is predominant in the in vivo response to this antigenic region, then these cells could function in either immune protection (by direct elimination of RV-infected cells) or adverse immunoreactivity (by destruction of synovial cells persistently infected with RV). These clones exhibited identical specificity despite having been generated with different antigenic stimuli. Moreover, both recognized not only the E 1 SPs but also naturally processed peptides from wild-type (M33) and attenuated RV vaccine strains (RA27/3 and HPV77), as well as recombinant RV E 1 protein. Although all three RV strains are considered to be completely homologous within residues 273-291 [29, 30] , weaker cytotoxicity was observed Target cells, HCLs, expressing different HLA-DR phenotypes were sensitized with SP E1(273-284) at a concentration of 10 p~M for 1 hour before adding T cells. b Autologous EBV-BL of the T-cell clones ATRVC2 and AT177C5. \u2022 The sequences are shown using the single-letter code, with dashes representing identity to the DR4Dw4 sequence. Residues shown in bold indicate the unique differences between DR4Dw13A, DR4Dwl3B, DR4TK2, and the other DR4 subtypes.\n\nwhen target cells were sensitized with RA27/3. Flanking amino acids may play a critical role in recognition of a given peptide sequence, presumably by influencing Ag processing, peptide conformation, and affinity for MHC binding [31] . Sequence analysis for RV structural proteins has revealed 12 aa substitutions in RA27/3 E1 protein relative to M33 strain [29] , while only three substitutions were reported for HPV77 E 1 [30] . Hence, the greater sequence variability of RA27/3 E 1 may have influenced Ag processing.\n\nTo delineate which residues within E 1(273-291) were critical for immune recognition by these CTL clones, truncated SPs spanning this region were compared for their capacity to target specific cytotoxicity. Results showed that E 1(273-284) was the shortest sequence capable of eliciting maximal cytotoxicity, while E1(272-282), the smallest antigenic SP evaluated, induced somewhat lower levels of killing. Rothbard and Taylor [32] and Rothbard and Gefter [33] have identified a primary sequence motif characteristic of T-cell antigenic sites consisting of 4-5 aa, including a charged residue or glycine, followed by 2-3 hydrophobic aa, then either a polar residue or glycine. Within E1(273-284), such a motif (EVWVT) was identified (Fig. 4) . To assess the role played by individual residues, four single aa-substituted analogues of SP E 1(273-284) were evaluated in cytotoxicity assays. Results showed that substituting a hydrophobic residue for a charged or polar one at position 273 or 277 substantially reduced cytotoxicity, indicating that these amino acids are important for recognition. Moreover, replacement of a nonpolar aa (W) at position 275 with an acidic aa (E) or replacement of a polar aa (T) with relatively larger-size residue (Y) at position 277 obliterated specific cytotoxicity. Hence, W-275 and T-277 appear to play a critical role in immune recognition of this sequence by these particular CTL clones. De Lisi and Berzofsky have proposed another model in which T-cell determinants correlated with amphipathic ot-helic structures in antigenic proteins [34] . The RV E1 sequence, EVWVT, is also located at the maximum of o~-helix indexes within residues 273-291 as determined from s-helix and [3-turn potentials and hydrophilicity plots of E 1 [ 14] . mAb experiments and cytotoxicity assays performed with different EBV-BLs confirmed that the HLA-DR4 subtypes DR4Dwl3A (DRBI*0403), DR4Dwl3B (DRB 1.0407), and DR4KT2 (DRB 1.0406) could serve as restriction elements for presentation of E 1(273-284) in this case. Furthermore, the DR [31 chain of the autologous EBV-BL, AT, was shown to have a nucleic acid sequence identical to DRB 1.0403. The molecular diversity of HLA-DR4 haplotypes is well known [35] , and at least 12 DR4 subtypes expressing different class II [~1 chains have been identified [28] . It is believed that the critical residues involved in Ag presentation by DR4 subtypes are located on the first domain of the HLA-DR4 ~1 chain, which shows the most variability [28, 35] . DR4Dw13A, DR4Dw13B, and DR4KT2, which were able to present E1(273-284) to the T-cell clones, differed significantly from the other DR4 subtypes at position 74, with a unique substitution (E for A). Such a charge change could influence immune recognition either by modifying peptide conformation or its interaction with the T-cell receptor (TcR). Alanine (A)-74 in the DR4 [~ 1 chain has been reported to be important in T-cell allo-or autoreactivity [36, 37] . A proposed HLA-DR-binding model consists of a core sequence of six amino acids involving a large hydrophobic residue separated by four amino acids from a small residue [38, 39] . O'Sullivan et al. [40, 41] also proposed a similar nineresidue motif composed of an aromatic or hydrophobic aa in position 1, followed by a noncharged and relatively small residue in position 6, and another relatively hydrophobic one in position 9. As predicted from these models and from the data presented herein, it is highly likely that the V-274 or W-275 and the V-279 or 1-280, respectively, represent the first and second hydrophobic anchor residues for binding to HLA-DR4. The third or more allele-specific anchor residue is likely the S-282 (Fig. 4) . Hence, these appear to be critical in both binding of the epitope, E1(273-284) to HLA-DR4 and its recognition by the T-cell clones in this study ( Fig. 2 and Table 2 ). Investigations are in progress to confirm the interaction of these critical residues with the HLA-DRbinding groove, or TcR. The results will determine the influence of residue 74-E in DR4 131 chain on peptide binding. The results of this clonal analysis revealed an antigenic site E1(273-284), that appeared to be highly restricted in its presentation to T cells and, as such, may not be very good for incorporation into a new RV vaccine. Yet residues 273-284 lie within a broader region of RV E 1(268-291), which appears to be widely recognized on a population basis by both T cells [19, 21] and antibodies [15, 17] from individuals of diverse MHC backgrounds. Why would such an antigenic site located within a predicted immunodominant region exhibit such high specificity of MHC restriction? One possible explanation is that the HLA-DR4 subtype-restricted sequence identified here represents only one of several clustered antigenic sites lying within E1 residues 268-291. Alternatively, there may exist in the human T-cell repertoire other TcRs capable of recognizing residues 273-284 in the context of other MHC class II molecules. Investigations are currently under way to determine whether this is the case. It is notable, however, that the HLA-DR4 phenotype has been associated with autoimmunity in other disease systems [42] , as has restricted TcR V (13) gone usage [43] . It is also of interest that the antigenic site recognized by the CTL clones described here overlaps almost completely with a previously defined [ 17] neutralizing antibody-binding domain (EP 1), suggesting that the apparent overlap between a class II HLA-restricted T-cell antigenic site and an antibody recognition site may not simply be fortuitous but may reflect a mechanistic link between Ag presentation and T-cell help for antibody synthesis. Overlapping B-and T-cell determinants could facilitate Ag uptake by B cells bearing surface Ag receptors of the appropriate specificity, followed by Ag processing and presentation by the B-cell HLA class II to the T cell, forming an \"antigen bridge\" to focus the appropriate T cells onto B cells [44] .\n\nIn conclusion, delineation of a T-cell antigenic site within the RV E1 sequence (273-284), which overlaps almost completely with the previously identified EP1neutralizing antibody-binding domain on this RV envelope protein, suggests that this region could have functional significance in immune protection mediated by both T cells and antibodies. If the outcome of the in vivo immune response to this epitope is immune protection, then this region would be a useful candidate for developing an effective subunit or recombinant infectious virion vaccine. The results of this study suggest, however, that the influence of MHC and TcR polymorphism on T-cell recognition of SP sequences should be considered in vaccine design. Future studies will determine whether this sequence may be recognized by other human TcRs in the context of other MHC class II molecules, and the phenotypes of the responding T cells, to assess its suit-ability as a component of second-generation RV vaccines. These investigations will also assess its in vivo immunogenicity for inducing protective or nonprotective T-and B-cell responses."}
