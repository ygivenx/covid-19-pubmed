Abl fusion proteins found in Ph \u03e9 leukemia patients (p190, per domain of murine coronavirus spike protein abolish oligomerization and biological activity (Luo et al., 1999) . p210, and p230). To investigate the role of the Bcr coiledcoil domain in regulating catalytic activity, cellular transformation, and leukemogenesis by p210 Bcr-Abl, we Bcr-Abl Coiled-Coil Domain Mutations Impair Oligomerization In Vivo generated a series of mutations that are predicted to disrupt the coiled-coil domain while leaving the extreme Bcr-Abl is predicted to form oligomers through the coiled-coil domain. To assess oligomerization by the N terminus of Bcr-Abl intact. p210\u232ccc removes amino acids 31 to 69 and deletes the entire coiled-coil domain coiled-coil domain mutants, we generated additional constructs that were truncated at a C-terminal BstEII ( Figure 1C ). p210F54P mutates phenylalanine at position 54 to proline ( Figure 1G) and is similar to a proline-con-site: p210\u232ccc/\u232cBX, p210F54P/\u232cBX, and p210LZA/\u232cBX ( Figures 1D, 1H, and 1M ). The full-length and truncated taining peptide insertion mutant described previously . The F54P mutation places a constructs were coexpressed in 293T cells and immunoprecipitated with the GEX5 antibody (C) that recognizes proline in the middle of the domain and is predicted to disrupt the coiled-coil by introducing a kink to the middle only the full-length protein (Figure 2A, lane 3) . The antibody pEX2 (N) recognizes and immunoprecipitates both of the \u2423 helix. The third mutant, p210LZA ( Figure 1L ), has point mutations at the \"a\" and \"d\" positions across full-length and truncated p210 proteins (Figure 2A , lane 2).

These point mutations are predicted to conserve the helical structure of the coiled-coil but replace the length version. Likewise, coassociation of the full-length and truncated p210 proteins was lost in the presence residues essential for stabilization of the dimer structure.

Surprisingly, the in vivo catalytic activity of p210 was relatively unaffected by the F54P mutation. This merization of p210 Bcr-Abl is dependent on an intact appeared to be the consequence of residual oligomeramphipathic coiled-coil domain.\n\nization of this mutant protein, because substitution of alanines for the \"a\" and \"d\" coiled-coil residues of p210F54P resulted in very low kinase activity (Figure 3 , Decreased In Vivo Tyrosine Kinase Activity of Bcr-Abl Coiled-Coil Deletion and Alanine Substitution compare p210F54P and p210F45P/LZA). These results demonstrate that oligomerization is required for dysreg-Mutants Is Restored by Loss of SH3 Function We next assessed the in vivo tyrosine kinase activity of ulation of Bcr-Abl kinase activity in vivo. Previous studies demonstrated that transformation of the Bcr-Abl coiled-coil mutant proteins. We transduced interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent Ba/F3 hematopoietic cytokine-dependent hematopoietic cell lines by Bcr-Abl lacking amino acids 1-63 can be partially rescued by cells with BCR-ABL retroviruses, selected G418-resistant populations in the presence of IL-3, and prepared deletion of the SH3 domain (Maru et al., 1996) .

In the first set, proline 1013 was mutated to leucine to generate p210\u232ccc/ affect the stability of the protein in vivo, possibly because activated Abl proteins are more sensitive to pro-P1013L, p210F54P/P1013L, and p210LZA/P1013L (Figures 1E, 1I, and 1N ). This mutation, which corresponds teasomal degradation (Echarri and Pendergast, 2001 Addition of either the P1013L or P1124L mutations to p210\u232ccc or p210LZA increased levels of cellular phosphotyrosine to that of wild-type p210-expressing cells without grossly altering the spectrum of phosphorylated proteins (Figure 3 ), but had little effect on the high constitutive activity of p210F54P. These data demonstrate that loss of SH3 ligand binding function restores maximal in vivo catalytic activity to Bcr-Abl in the absence of oligomerization.\n\nTo determine the impact of oligomerization on Bcr-Abl transforming activity, we tested the ability of the coiledcoil mutants to induce the anchorage-independent growth of fibroblasts. NIH The LZA mutation also significantly reduced transformation of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. The p210F54P mutant transformed fibroblasts nearly as efficiently as wild-type p210, but mutation of the hydrophobic leucine zipper residues to alanine (p210F54P/LZA; see Figure 1K ) abolished transformation, again suggesting that the F54P \n\nBcr-Abl Coiled-Coil Deletion and Alanine Substitution effect on the robust transforming activity of p210F54P.\n\nMutants Are Defective for Transformation of Primary Thus, point mutations in the Abl SH3 domain or its puta-Bone Marrow B-Lymphoid Progenitors tive intramolecular ligand can compensate for inactivat-To assess transformation of primary bone marrow ing mutations in the coiled-coil domain.

We have modified this assay to include serial cells and immunoprecipitated as described above.

The coiled-coil deletion or alation loop of the catalytic domain and Tyr245 in the linker nine substitution mutants were completely defective in region between the SH2 and catalytic domains (Brasher this assay, with no detectable growth even at the highest and Van Etten, 2000). Using tyrosine to phenylalanine plating density (Figures 5C and 5F ). Expression of substitution mutants, we examined the requirement for p210F54P resulted in growth of some wells at higher these sites for Bcr-Abl kinase activity and transformaplating densities, but growth of the lower dilutions was tion. Mutation of either the homologous activation loop impaired relative to wild-type p210 ( Figure 5I ), while the tyrosine (Tyr1294) or the SH2-CD linker tyrosine (Tyr1127) p210F54P/LZA double mutant was completely inactive alone modestly decreased Bcr-Abl in vivo kinase activ-( Figure 5O ). Transformation by all three coiled-coil doity, while a Y1127/1294F double mutant displayed even main mutants was significantly increased by secondary lower activity (Figure 3 ). Tyr to Phe mutation at either mutations in the SH3 or SH2-CD linker sites, particularly position was sufficient to abolish fibroblast transformaby the P1124L mutation, which restored transformation tion by Bcr-Abl ( Figure 4A ). Taken together, these results to the level of wild-type p210 in all cases. Expression of demonstrate that loss of either oligomerization or auto-p210Y1294F resulted in modestly decreased cell growth phosphorylation results in defective fibroblast transforrelative to that induced by wild-type p210 ( Figure 5M ), mation by Bcr-Abl.\n\nwhile the Y1127F and Y1127/1294F mutants showed no growth at any cell plating density ( Figures 5L and 5N ).

Like p210 Bcr-Abl, the p210F54P construct was able to support their ability to induce leukemia in vivo (Van Etten, 2002), emphasizing the need to assess the role of Bcr-Abl rapid IL-3-independent growth. In contrast, p210\u232ccc and p210LZA induced greatly diminished proliferation oligomerization, SH3 function, and autophosphorylation in leukemogenesis. Hence, we tested the ability of the under the same conditions. If followed for an additional 48 hr, cultures expressing p210\u232ccc or p210LZA reached Bcr-Abl coiled-coil mutants to induce CML-like myeloproliferative disease in mice using the bone marrow ret-confluence (data not shown), demonstrating that oligomerization of Bcr-Abl enhances IL-3-independent growth roviral transduction/transplantation model. In this assay, mice transplanted with p210-transduced bone marrow but is not absolutely required for transformation of these cells, in agreement with more recent work ( Figure 6) , characterized by peripheral blood leukocytosis with greatly increased neutro-p210LZA resulted in IL-3 independent growth that was comparable to that of cells expressing wild-type p210 phils, hepatosplenomegaly, and infiltration of spleen, liver, and lungs with maturing myeloid cells (Li et al., 1999) . (Figures 4C and 4D) . As in fibroblasts, the loss of Bcr-\n\nBalb/c bone marrow was transduced with the indicated BCR-ABL retrovirus and plated at indicated cell numbers per well in triplicate wells. Nontransduced cells were added to 10 6 total cells to provide stromal support. Wells were scored as positive when the viable nonadherent cell number reached 10 6 /well. Although p210Y1294F was previously reported to be defective in this assay (Pendergast et al., 1993) , this might be due to low virus titer in that study.\n\nIn contrast, mice transplanted with marrow transduced antsev et al., 2001). These results demonstrate that efficient oligomerization through the coiled-coil domain and with p210\u232ccc or p210LZA failed to develop CML-like disease, but instead succumbed to T-lymphoid leuke-maximal levels of Bcr-Abl kinase activity are required for induction of CML. mia/lymphoma (T-ALL) after a long latent period ( Figures  6A and 6B) \n\nThe P1013L SH3 mutation rescued efficient induction of CML-like disease by p210\u232ccc ( Figure 6A) \n\nimplicates directly the ligand binding function of the SH3 thymus, and a hemorrhagic malignant pleural effusion that was the cause of death ( Figure 6C) .
