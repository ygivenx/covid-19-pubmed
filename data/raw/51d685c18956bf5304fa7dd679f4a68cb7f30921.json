{"title": "Rabies Virus Glycoprotein Is a Trimer", "body": "The glycoprotein (G) of rabies virus is the only surface protein of the virion . It constitutes the spikes which protrude from the viral surface and plays a critical role in virus infection . First, it initiates the interaction between the virus and the target cell : it is responsible for virus attachment to specific receptors on the cell (Wunner at at, 1984) and, therefore, is important in determining the tissue tropism of the virus (Kucera at at, 1985 ; Coulon at at, 1989 ; Lafay et al., 1991) . Second, after attachment to the host cell and internalization of the virion via the endocytic pathway, the G protein mediates the low pH-induced fusion of the viral envelope with the endocytic vesicle membrane (Mifune at al., 1982 ; Gaudin et al ., 1991 a) . Finally, the G protein stimulates the host immune system and induces the synthesis of neutralizing antibodies (Wiktor et al., 1973) .\n\nThe complete glycoprotein molecule is 505 amino acids long (Anilionis etal., 1981 ; Yelverton etal., 1983) .\n\nIts predicted amino acid sequence indicates that it has three potential N-linked oligosaccharide acceptor sites, of which only one or two are glycosylated (Dietzschold, 1977 ; Dietzschold at at, 1979 ; Wunner et al., 1985) . Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shows that for the CVS and PM strains of rabies virus two forms of G exist (Arita and Atanasiu, 1980) which have, respectively, one and two carbohydrate chains (Dietzschold at al., 1979 ; Wunner at at, 1985) . The glycoprotein is also palmitoylated on a cysteine situated on the C-terminal side of its transmembrane re-' To whom reprint requests should be addressed . 627 gion (Gaudin et al., 1991 b) . The entity which constitutes a spike at the viral surface has been reported to be an oligomer of G (Dietzschold et al., 1978 ; Delagneau et al., 1981) , but whether it was a trimer as it has been suggested for the glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Doms et at, 1987) was not established .\n\nIn this paper, using high electron microscopy of negatively stained samples and hydrodynamic techniques, we have studied the oligomeric structure of G both on the viral surface and after solubilization with detergents . These studies clearly show that the native quaternary structure of G is trimeric . However, most detergents used in this study solubilized G in a monomeric form and only CHAPS, a zwitterionic detergent, allowed solubilization of G in its native trimeric structure . Our results also provide the basis for a low-resolution model of the glycoprotein structure .\n\nOctyl glucoside (OG) and decanoyl-N-methyl glucamide (MEGA 10) were purchased from Boehringer . 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethyl-ammonio]-1-propane sulfonate (CHAPS) was bought from Sigma Chemical Co, 6-0-(N-heptylcarbamoyl)-methyl-a-D-glucopyranosi de (Hecameg) was from Vegatec (France), and Triton X-1 00 was from Prolabo (France) .\n\nBSR cells, a clone of BHK 21 (baby hamster kidney), were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum . \n\nThe CVS strain of rabies virus and the antigenic mutant 50L1, mutated at amino acid 333 of the viral glycoprotein (Arg to Glu), were grown in BSR cells at 37\u00b0 in MEM supplemented with 2% calf serum . Virus particles were pelleted from the culture fluid 72 hr postinfection through 30% glycerol in 10 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7 .5, 50 mM NaCI, 1 mM EDTA, and resuspended in TD (137 mM NaCI, 5 mM KCI, 0 .7 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 25 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7 .5, 10 mM EDTA) .\n\nSolubilization and purification of G protein One volume of virus in TD (4 mg/mI) was added to 1 vol of solubilization buffer (TD plus 2 yg/ml leupeptin, 2 ttg/mi antipain, 2 pg/ml pepstatin, 2 \u00b5g/ml chymostatin, 16 pg/ml aprotinin) containing 2% CHAPS . The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0 and then overlayed on 20% sucrose in TD plus 1 % CHAPS and centrifuged for 1 hr at 35K to separate solubilized glycoprotein from the rest of the virus particle . The supernatant mainly containing G was then applied onto a 5-20* sucrose gradient in TD plus 1 % CHAPS and centrifuged for 16 hr at 35,000 rpm in an SW41 rotor (Beckman) . Twelve fractions were collected and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) . The fractions containing G were concentrated on Centricon 30 (Amicon) and conserved at 4\u00b0. The sedimentation coefficient of G was determined on the sucrose gradient using BSA (4 .6 S), influenza hemagglutinin (9 S), and catalase (11 S) as sedimentation standards .\n\nFourteen percent SDS-PAGE of proteins were performed as described by Laemmli (1970) . They were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue .\n\nSamples were diluted with PBS (150 mM NaCI ; 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7 .4) or PBS plus 1 %a CHAPS (see Results) to a protein concentration of 50 pg/ml . A small droplet was applied to the edge of a piece of carbon film on mica upon which the droplet was sucked into the carbon/mica interface and the sample adsorbed onto the clean face of the carbon film . The carbon film plus sample was then floated on a solution of 1 % sodium silicotungstate (SST), picked up with an EM grid, and subsequently air-dried . Pictures were taken on a Jeol 1000XII electron microscope at a magnification of 40K under low-dose conditions . The magnification was calibrated using the 17 .5-nm spacing of negatively stained catalase crystals . Measurements were made from prints of 160K magnification with a graticule eyepiece giving additional magnification of 8X . \n\nSeveral detergents were used, with variable success, to solubilize the glycoprotein from purified virions . For instance, OG (3%) and HECAMEG (1 .5%a) did not efficiently solubilize the protein : after the first centrifugation (see Material and Methods), G was found in the pellet associated with the nucleocapsids (data not shown) . Other detergents (0 .7% of MEGA 10, 0 .5% of Triton X100, 1% of THESIT) were efficient . However, using these detergents, the solubilized glycoprotein had a sedimentation coefficient of approximately 4S ( Fig . 2B) which, by comparison with VSV glycoprotein (Doms et al., 1987) or with BSA, indicated that it was monomeric and therefore had lost its putative quaternary structure . As the trimeric structure of VSV glycoprotein is stabilized at slightly acidic pH (Doms et al ., 1987) , we also tried to solubilize G with Triton X100 at pH 5 .7 as described for VSV . In this case, G was also monomeric .\n\nFinally, we decided to use CHAPS, a zwitterionic detergent, which efficiently solubilized G together with some M 1 and M2 (Fig . 1A) . In the presence of 1 % CHAPS (16 .2 mM), G had an apparent sedimentation coefficient of 9 S ( Fig . 2A) and could be separated from the two other proteins (Fig . 113 ) . This sedimentation coefficient was very similar to that of native influenza HA (9 S) (Brand and Skehel, 1972) and VSV glycoprotein (8 S) (Doms etal., 1987) , both of which are trimeric . However, as the hydrodynamic properties of a protein may be significantly modified in the presence of detergent, we looked for other evidence to confirm the trimeric nature of the native rabies virus glycoprotein . The oligomeric structure of G also appeared to be crucially dependent on the CHAPS concentration : increasing the concentration to 2% (32 .4 mM) rendered G monomeric while decreasing the CHAPS concentration to 0 .5% (8 .1 mM) led to self-aggregation of G . Therefore, the purification protocol described under Materials and Methods was routinely used for further experiments .\n\nWhen rabies virus (50L1) was prepared for electron microscopy by negative staining with SST, which has a natural pH of 7, G could be seen in side view on the periphery of the virions and in end-on view on the surface of the virus particles (Fig . 3) . The virus particles were deformed during the preparation procedure which helped visualization of G as it spread out the proteins so that individual complexes could be seen . Seen in side view, G looked like a head on a thin stalk, resembling the influenza neuraminidase (Ruigrok etal., 1986) . The total length of the spike was 8 .3 nm (for standard deviations and number of measurements, see Fig . 6 ) . The height of the head was about 4 .8 nm which left 3 .5 him forthe stalk . Even when the stalk was not visible in Fig . 3 , we assumed that the amount of G protein mass near the membrane was less than that at the position of the head since there was stain accumulation between head and membrane .\n\nIn end-on view, triangles consisting of three dots were frequently observed in the regions where there were only few molecules . The side of the triangle measured 8 .4 nm . This indicated that, on the virus, G had a trimeric quaternary structure . When the density of G on the viral surface was too high, separated triangles were not recognized .\n\nWhen detergent-isolated G was negatively stained with SST, different two-dimensional projections of the various aggregation states of an asymetric structure RABIES VIRUS GLYCOPROTEIN IS A TRIMER 629 could be observed (Fig . 4A) . Upon close examination, we could discern three major types of shape labeled B, C, and D in Fig . 4A , that are shown with higher magnifi- Figure 4B shows a side view of isolated spikes ; a head on a stalk with a total length of 13 .2 nm, the head being 6 .1-nm wide and 5 .0-nm high . Isolated spikes were 4 .9 nm longer than spikes extending from the membrane of virus, which was consistent with the additional presence of the transmembrane (residues 440-461) plus cytoplasmic parts (462-505) of G . About 25% of the spikes measured (the criterium for selection being a stalk with a head) were longer than 13 .2 nm and showed a separate peak in the length distribution of 16 .1 \u00b1 0 .4 nm (n = 34) (see Fig . 5 ) . This higher value might be caused by a different orientation on the grid of one or both extreme ends of the molecule, or by different conformations of the molecule . Different orientations of the amino terminus of the adenovirus fiber protein also resulted in different overall lengths (Ruigrok et al ., 1990) . Figure 4C shows the spike in end-on view, similar triangles as shown for the end-on view of G on virus, indicating clearly the trimeric nature of the spike formed by G . The side of the triangle measured 8 .8 nm which was more than the average width of the head (6 .1 nm) when seen in side view . The monomers making up the trimer seemed to have come somewhat apart when G was adsorbed head-on on the carbon film . Figure 4D shows doublets of trimers that are associated via their hydrophobic transmembrane parts . The total length of a doublet was 21 .6 nm which agreed with twice the length of detergent-isolated G minus one transmembrane plus cytoplasmic part (13 .2 + 13 .2 -4 .9) . The length of these doublet was well defined and the length distribution showed only one peak . This suggested that the single trimers with the length of 16 .1 nm had a length extension at their N-terminal end when compared with the 13 .2-nm spikes . Possibly, the cytoplasmic part of G of the 16 .1-nm spike is folded differently, or is lying on the carbon film in a different manner than that of the 13 .2-nm spike . Model drawings of G on virus, detergent-isolated single trimers, and doublets are shown in Fig . 6 . Drawings of G on virus and detergent-isolated G, single trimers, and doublets . The dimensions are indicated but note that forthe width of the heads we used the measurement of the sides of the triangles of the end-on orientation of G on the carbon film, which differs from the direct measurement of the width (see text) . The transmembrane plus cytoplasmic parts of detergent-isolated G are shaded . In the drawing of the single trimer of detergent-isolated G, we have not taken into account the fraction of molecules that had a length of about 16 non . The length of spikes extending from the viral membrane was 8 .3 \u00b10 .6 nm (number of measurements : n = 80) ; the height of the head of viral G was 4 .8 i 0 .7 non (o = 22), the side length of the triangles observed on virus was 8 .4\u00b1 1 .1 nm (n = 41) . the length of detergent-isolated spikes was 13 .2 \u00b1 0 .6 nm (n = 95), and the height and the width of their head were, respectively, 5 .0 \u00b1 1 .0 nm (n = 43) and 6 .1 \u00b1 0 .9 nm (o = 47), whereas the side length of isolated triangles was 8 .8 \u00b1 0 .6 nor (n = 93) . The length of doublets was 21 .6 \u00b1 1 .0 nm (n = 88) .\n\nApart from single trimers and doublets, many different aggregated forms of G may be observed in Fig . 4A . This aggregation was caused by dilution with PBS necessary for EM preparation . The same preparation diluted with PBS plus 1 % CHAPS showed mainly separate, nonaggregated molecules of G (data not shown) .\n\nIn this paper, we have investigated the quaternary structure of the glycoprotein G of rabies virus using electron microscopy of negatively stained samples . This technique allows reliable results and measurements (Ruigrok et at, 1986) provided that the protein is not denatured by the preparation procedure . When we measured the length of G via cryoelectron microscopy of frozen hydrated virus which is supposed to be a nondenaturing technique, we obtained a similar result as presented here from negatively stained virus (Hewat and Ruigrok, unpublished) suggesting that the staining procedure did not denature G .\n\nFirst, our work has demonstrated that the rabies glycoprotein is organized as a trimer at the viral surface confirming the results obtained by Whitt et al . (1991) using a cross-linking reagent on G expressed in Hela cells from cloned cDNA . This trimer can be solubilized RABIES VIRUS GLYCOPROTEIN IS A TRIMER 6 3 1 detergent isolated G 13 .2nm 4 under its native quaternary structure with CHAPS, a zwitterionic detergent . However, once the glycoprotein is solubilized, this trimeric organization is not very stable and appears to be sensitive to most of the detergents that we used . Such an instability has also been reported in the case of VSV : solubilized with OG, VSV G appeared to be monomeric (Crimmins et al., 1983) while, solubilized with Triton X100 at acidic pH, VSV G appeared to be trimeric (Doms et al., 1987) . Such a stabilization of the oligomeric structure at acidic pH was not observed in the case of rabies virus G (Whitt et at, 1991 ; this work) . Apparently, the oligomeric organization of the rhabdovirus glycoproteins is less stable than that of influenza virus hemagglutinin of which the trimeric organization is resistant to most detergents such as Triton X100 (Skehel et al., 1982) , Brij 36T (Skehel etal., 1982 ; Ruigrok et al., 1986) , OG (Ruigrok etal., 1986) , and C 12 E a (Stegmann et al., 1987) . This relative instability may also explain why the trimeric end-on view of detergent-isolated G and G on deformed virus shows a larger width (8 .8 and 8 .4 nm, respectively) for the head than detergent-isolated G in side view (6 .1 nm) . Numerous viral external proteins such as the adenovirus fiber (Ruigrok et al., 1990) , the reovirus cell attachment protein 1 (Strong et at, 1991) , the corona-virus spike protein (Delmas and Laude, 1990) , the rhabdovirus glycoproteins (Doms et al., 1987 ; this work) , and the hemagglutinin of influenza virus (Wilson et al., 1981) , which are implicated in receptor recognition and/or carry the membrane fusion properties of the virion, are trimeric . This might have some biological significance and may reflect similarities in the mechanisms involved in receptor recognition and/or membrane fusion .\n\nElectron microscopy also indicates that the native molecule has a \"head\" and a \"stalk\" and indications on the respective dimensions of those two parts have been obtained . The fact that rabies virus glycoprotein has a stalk may indicate that a certain flexibility of the head of the glycoprotein is required .\n\nSo far, very little is known about the structure of rabies virus glycoprotein . The glycoprotein isolated with CHAPS as described here will hopefully allow more detailed structural and biochemical studies ."}
