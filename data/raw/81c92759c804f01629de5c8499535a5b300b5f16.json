{"title": "Supplementary methods S1", "body": "Nasal swabs were collected at the onset of the first ARI (swab A) and three weeks later (swab B) at the homes of the infants by a research nurse using FLOQSwabs with universal transport medium (UTM, Copan, Italy) and subsequently stored at -80 \u00b0C.\n\nA detailed pre-and postnatal questionnaire allowed collecting extensive data on several host factors which were of interest in our study (3) . Atopy was defined as positive if the infants' mother, father or siblings were suffering from eczema, allergic rhinitis or asthma. Siblings were counted when living in the same household as the study participant. Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure was defined as positive if there was at least one parent smoking tobacco in the same household. Data on nutrition including breastfeeding were collected throughout the first year of life in weekly telephone interviews.\n\nBacterial 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid PCR amplification and 454 Titanium FLX sequencing Amplification of bacterial 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) by PCR and 454 Titanium FLX sequencing has been described previously (4, 5) . In summary, after DNA extraction the variable regions V3 to V5 of bacterial 16S rRNA gene were amplified by using the multiplex identifier tagged primer pair 341F/907R. After elution of the PCR reactions by 40 \u00b5L of doubledistilled water, the concentration was measured with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Basel, Switzerland). Amplification products with a concentration of less than 1.0 ng/\u00b5L which corresponds to less than 1 pg/\u00b5L bacterial DNA were excluded from this study according to recent recommendations (6) . Samples were pooled using 40 ng/ \u00b5L of purified PCR product, resulting in 8 amplicon pools labelled with unique multiplex identifiers. The reads from 454 Titanium amplicon sequencing were submitted to the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) (accession number PRJEB20454). The average number of reads is 1246.6 with a SD 684.0. There were only 7/334 samples with less than 250 reads. Bacterial density was described as the concentration of PCR product within a sample.\n\nSequencing products were analyzed using Pyrotagger, with the definition of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on 97% similarity, estimation of chimeras, and taxonomic assignments (7) . Bacterial abundances were calculated using Pyrotagger, as described elsewhere (8) . Resulting OTUs were assigned to the five most abundant families with the remaining families grouped together as \"Others\".\n\nOur group has previously used the same protocol and have calculated the estimated versus observed richness in a similar set of samples (5) . We revealed that the observed species richness covered in average (mean (\u00b1 SD)) 63\u00b73% (\u00b117\u00b76%) of the estimated species richness (see Figure s3 in (5)).\n\nAlpha diversity analysis was performed using the \"diversity\" function of the \"vegan\" software package of R, version 3.02 (http://www.R-project.org) calculating the Shannon Diversity Index (SDI) to describe within-community diversity. For community comparisons between swab A and swab B the \u03b2 diversity was calculated using the \"vegdist\" function of the \"vegan\" software package of R. We chose the Manhattan-type Jaccard dissimilarity index as weighted (abundance-based) \u03b2 diversity.\n\nThe hierarchical clustering was performed using Matlab 2015b (Mathworks, Natick Massachusetts, United States). The relative abundances of the five most frequent bacterial families with the remaining families grouped together as \"Others\" were used as input variables for clustering of both swabs. The optimal number of clusters was determined by Silhouette index (9) and KL index (10) for both swabs. Both indices suggested 6 clusters for swab A. Since the sixth cluster was too small for phenotyping purposes (n = 2 infants), it was thus excluded from the study, resulting in five clusters, including 165 infants. For swab B, KL index suggested five clusters and Silhouette index suggested seven clusters. Also taking into account the clusters' sizes, the optimal cluster number for swab B was six. However, as the last three clusters were too small for phenotyping purposes (n \u2264 6 infants), they were not considered for the current study, resulting in three clusters, including 155 infants. The clustering was also validated with the K-means clustering method, which resulted in similar cluster numbers and classes for both swabs."}
