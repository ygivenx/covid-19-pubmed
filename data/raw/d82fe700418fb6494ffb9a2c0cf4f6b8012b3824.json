{"title": "Fitness barriers limit reversion of a proofreading-deficient coronavirus 1 2", "body": "The rapid evolution of RNA viruses represents a significant challenge for preventing, treating, 57 and eradicating RNA viral diseases. High mutation rates in RNA viruses generate extensive 58 opportunities to overcome evolutionary hurdles, such as antiviral drugs, host immunity, or 59 engineered attenuating changes (1). The evolutionary pathways traversed by RNA viruses are 60 shaped by natural selection, which will favor some evolutionary trajectories more than others 61 based on whether mutations are beneficial, deleterious, or neutral (2). Predicting the likely results 62 of RNA virus evolution is an important step for anticipating viral emergence and for developing 63 escape-resistant antiviral drugs and vaccines (3, 4). 64 65 Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a family of positive-sense RNA viruses that cause human illnesses 66 ranging from the common cold to severe and lethal respiratory disease (5). All CoVs encode a 67 proofreading exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is critical for 68 replication, fidelity, fitness, and virulence, and ExoN-inactivation has been proposed as a 69 strategy for live-attenuated vaccine development (6-15). As members of the DEDDh superfamily 70 of exonucleases, CoV ExoNs hydrolyze nucleotides using four metal-coordinating amino acids 71 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/618249 doi: bioRxiv preprint ExoN active site mutants in alphacoronaviruses, including transmissible gastroenteritis virus and 77 hCoV-229E, have yet to be recovered and are proposed to be lethal for replication (19, 20) . infections and prolonged passage in tissue culture and following treatment with multiple 87 nucleoside analogues (6-11, 13, 14). SARS-CoV-ExoN-AA also is stable during acute and 88 persistent animal infections in immunocompetent and immune-compromised mice (12) . The lack 89 of primary reversion is not due simply to reduced adaptive capacity, as both SARS-CoV-and 90 MHV-ExoN-AA can adapt for increased replication (7, 14). Most strikingly, long-term passage 91 of MHV-ExoN-AA (250 passages, P250) yielded a highly fit population that had directly 92 compensated for defective proofreading through evolution of a likely high-fidelity RdRp (7 requires mutations to all four sites ( Figure 1A ). Viral mutation rates in the absence of 113 proofreading range from 10 -4 to 10 -6 mutations per nucleotide per round of replication (\u00b5) (1). 114\n\nAssuming an ExoN-AA mutation rate of 10 -4 \u00b5 and accounting for codon degeneracy, the 115 probability of restoring the native amino acid sequence in a single round of replication is 10 -18 . 116\n\nOnly rarely do ExoN-AA titers exceed 10 6 PFU/mL, so it is unlikely that ExoN-AA could 117 navigate this genetic barrier in a single infectious cycle. Thus, we hypothesized that ExoN-AA 118 reversion, if possible, would proceed incrementally. To identify potential pathways towards 119\n\nExoN-AA reversion, we examined the possible single-nucleotide substitutions surrounding A89 120 and A91 ( Figure 1B ). Three mutations are synonymous, and five mutations yield amino acids 121 unlikely to coordinate with the positively-charged metals required for ExoN catalysis (glycine, 122 valine, proline, threonine, and serine) (16, 19, 21, 22). One mutation per site can restore the 123 acidic charge (i.e. AA-to-ED) but not the native amino acid. These variants have not been tested 124 in a CoV ExoN, but biochemical studies of E. coli DNA polymerase I ExoN mutants suggest that 125 these conservative substitutions would not restore WT-like ExoN activity (23) . We predicted 126 stepwise pathways to ExoN-AA\u00e0DE reversion based on restoration of acidic charge followed 127 by reversion to native amino acids ( Figure 1C ). We engineered and recovered variants in ExoN-128 AA requiring three mutations (3nt; ExoN-AD, ExoN-EA), two mutations (2nt; ExoN-DA, ExoN-129 ED, ExoN-AE), or one mutation (1nt; ExoN-DD, ExoN-EE) for reversion to WT-ExoN-DE 130 (Table 1) . We will hereafter refer to these mutants as intermediate revertants. All intermediate 131 All rights reserved.

The 3nt and 2nt mutants were genetically 133 stable during recovery, as confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. However, both 1nt mutants (ExoN-134 DD and ExoN-EE) reverted to WT-ExoN-DE during three independent recovery attempts, 135\n\nsuggesting that these two variants are less fit than WT-ExoN-DE and demonstrating that 136 reversion by 1nt mutation is readily accessible. To test whether the 3nt or 2nt mutants would 137 revert more rapidly than ExoN-AA (4nt), we passaged three lineages of each mutant 10 times at (Table 1 ). In contrast, the 2nt ExoN-AE contained WT-revertants by P2 145 in all lineages at MOI = 0.5 PFU/cell and by P8 in one lineage at MOI = 0.01 PFU/cell. Once 146 observed, WT-revertants dominated the ExoN-AE population for the remaining passages. These 147 data indicate that at least one 2nt mutation pathway can lead to full reversion in tissue culture. 148\n\nThe probability of ExoN-AE arising during a single infectious cycle of ExoN-AA is low but 149 theoretically achievable (~10 -9 ), so ExoN-AA could conceivably revert within just two infectious 150 cycles. However, complete reversion has never been observed even during prolonged passage or 151 persistent infections, suggesting that additional barriers to the replication, fitness, or maintenance 152 of intermediate revertants exist. 153 All rights reserved.

Finally, the nsp12-P250 224 and nsp14-P250 mutations significantly decreased fitness relative to WT-ExoN-DE ( Figure 4C ). 225\n\nWe detected no statistical differences between the specific infectivity of WT-ExoN-DE and any 226 of the nsp12-P250 and nsp14-P250 variants in isolated infections ( Figure 4D ). Thus, mutations 227 in nsp12 and nsp14 that arose in the ExoN-AA background were detrimental to replication, 228 mutagen sensitivity, and competitive fitness in the presence of a fully-reverted ExoN-DE.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/618249 doi: bioRxiv preprint Our results also extend existing studies of CoV ExoN motif I. Motif I AA\u00e0DE mutations in the 249 SARS-CoV nsp14-ExoN dramatically reduce nuclease activity in biochemical assays, but no 250 study has examined the contributions of each residue independently (16, 18) . Intermediate 251 revertants of ExoN-AA did not display consistent or statistical differences in replication, 5-FU 252 sensitivity, or competitive fitness relative to ExoN-AA, suggesting that they remain 253 phenotypically ExoN(-) during infection and supporting previous studies that motif I DE is 254 essential for WT ExoN function. Given these results, we were surprised to observe repeated 255 reversion of the ExoN-AE but not the other two 2nt variants, ExoN-DA and ExoN-ED. One 256 potential explanation is that the specific mutational bias of ExoN-AE makes the revertant 257 mutations more accessible than in ExoN-DA or ExoN-ED. Alternatively, if ExoN-AE has 258 profound replication or fitness defects, selection could drive primary reversion more quickly 259 away from this genotype. Consistent with this hypothesis, ExoN-AE reverted more quickly at a 260 higher MOI, where natural selection acts more efficiently on a larger population size (Table 1) Consistent with this hypothesis, the fitness effects of mutations in nsp12-P250 and nsp14-P250 269 differ based on the motif I genotype; they are beneficial in ExoN-AA but detrimental in the WT-270 All rights reserved.

In previous studies, it has been difficult to determine whether the fitness 271 defects in ExoN(-) CoVs are directly linked to low-fidelity replication or through some other 272 mechanism. Our data suggest that the proofreading function of nsp14-ExoN can be uncoupled 273 from its more general role in replication (Figure 4) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/618249 doi: bioRxiv preprint Cloning and recovery of recombinant viruses. Site-directed mutagenesis in MHV genome 306 fragments was performed using \"round the horn\" PCR (originally described in (33)). Briefly, 307 adjacent primers containing the mutation of interest were 5\u00a2-phosphorylated using T4 308 polynucleotide kinase (NEB, M0201S) using the buffer from the T4 DNA ligase, which contains 309 ATP (M0202S). PCR was performed on a plasmid template using the Q5 High-fidelity 2x previously (9). Briefly, genomic RNA was detected with a 5' 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and 341 3' black hole quencher 1 (BHQ-1) labeled probe targeting nsp2 (Biosearch Technologies,  342 Petaluma, CA), and RNA copy number was calculated by reference to an RNA standard derived 343 from the MHV A fragment. Samples were plated in technical duplicate to minimize well-to-well 344 variation. Titers were determined by plaque assay in DBT-9 cells, and specific infectivity was 345 calculated as PFU per supernatant genomic RNA copy. 346 347 5-fluorouracil sensitivity assays.
