Our work offers 49 practical solutions for genome sequencing and analyses of HCoV-19 and other 50 emerging viruses. 51\n\nGZMU0030 and GZMU0031) with Ct between 29-32, resulting in inferior sequencing depth 112 (less than 100X) (Table 1) . Isolating viruses and enriching them in cell culture might improve 113 the situation, but this requires high-standard laboratory settings and expertise apart from 114 being time-consuming. Also, unwanted mutations that are not concordant with original clin-115 ical samples may be introduced during the culturing process. 116\n\nTo enrich adequate viral content for whole-genome sequencing in a convenient manner, we 117 pursued two other methods: multiplex PCR amplification (amplicon) and hybrid capture 118 (capture) (Fig. 1) . We designed a systematic study to comprehensively validate the bias, 119 sensitivity, inter-individual (variant) and intra-individual (iSNV) accuracy of multiple ap-120 proaches by sequencing serial dilutions of a cultured isolate (unpublished), as well as the 121 eight clinical samples (Fig. 2) . We performed qRT-PCR of 10-fold serial dilutions (D1-D7) of 122 the cultured isolate, and the Ct was 17.3, 20.8, 24.5 for, 28.7, 31.8, 35, and 39.9, respec-123 tively, indicating the undiluted RNA (D0) of the cultured isolate contained ~1E+08 genome 124 copies per mL. For amplicon sequencing, we utilized two kits comprising of two set of pri-125 mers generating PCR products of 300-400 bp and 100-200 bp, respectively. The ~400 bp 126 amplicon-based sequencing was implemented in all samples and analyzed throughout the 127 study, while the ~200 bp amplicon-based sequencing was only applied in the cultured isolate 128 for coverage analysis. 129 to inadequate depth in amplicon sequencing (Fig. 3a) . Another pitfall is that amplification 142 across the genome can hardly be unbiased, causing difficulties in complete genome assem-143 bly. Indeed, amplicon sequencing exhibited a higher level of bias compared with meta-144 transcriptomic sequencing, in terms of coverage across the viral genomes from the cultural 145\n\nisolate and the clinical samples tested in our study (Fig. 3b, d, Supplementary Fig. 1 ). To 146 our surprise, however, capture sequencing was almost as unbiased as meta sequencing, 147 demonstrating better performance than the previous capture method used to enrich ZIKV 148 despite the HCoV-19 genome is ~3 fold larger than ZIKV 22 (Fig. 3b, c) . Two reasons 149 amongst others were likely to be accountable to this improvement, 1) we utilized 506 pieces 150 of 120 ssDNA probes covering 2x of the HCoV-19 genome to capture the libraries, 2) we 151 employed the DNBSEQ sequencing technology that features PCR-free rolling circle replica-152 tion (RCR) of DNA Nanoballs (DNBs) 23,24 . 153\n\nThe sequencing results of amplicon and capture approaches revealed dramatic increases 154 in the ratio of HCoV-19 reads out of the total reads compared with meta sequencing, sug-155 gesting the enrichment was highly efficient -5596-fold in capture method and 5710-fold in 156 amplicon method for each sample on average (Supplementary Table 1 -2). To further com-157 pare the sensitivity of different methods, we plotted the number of HCoV-19 reads per million 158 (HCoV-19-RPM) of total sequencing reads against the viral concentration for each sample. 159\n\nThe productivity was similar between the two methods when the input RNA of the cultured 160 isolate contained 1E+05 genome copies per mL and above (Fig. 3e) . However, amplicon 161 1E+06 copies of HCoV-19 genome per mL, while capture sequencing requires 24,474 to 9 177 Mb for the same situation (Fig. 3g, Supplementary Table 4) . 178\n\nTo determine the accuracy of dif-179 ferent approaches in discovering inter-individual genetic diversity, we tested each method 180 in calling the single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and verified some of the SNVs with Sanger 181 sequencing ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Two to five SNVs were identified within each clinical 182 sample, and in all the seven samples, SNVs identified by the three methods were concord-183 ant except that capture missed one SNV at position 16535 in GZMU0014 (Fig. 4a) . We then 184 investigated the allele frequencies of these sites across methods, and found that alleles 185 identified by capture sequencing displayed lower frequencies than the other two methods, 186 especially for GZMU0014, GZMU0030, and GZMU0042 where the viral load was lower (Ct 187 \u2265 29), which explained why capture sequencing neglected an SNV in our pipeline when the 188 cutoff of SNV calling was set as 80% allele frequency (Fig. 4b) . These data indicate that 189 amplicon sequencing is more accurate than capture sequencing in identifying SNVs, espe-190 cially for challenging samples.

Together these results suggest amplicon sequencing was not as accurate as 206 capture sequencing in identifying minor alleles, which could be in part due to Matthew effect 207 caused by PCR. 208\n\nsequencing has also allowed us to investigate RNA expression patterns of the overall mi-210 crobiome and host content and thus suitable for discovering new viruses, distinguishing co-211 infections, and dissecting virus-host interactions. To explore the microbiota, we performed 212 further metatranscriptomics analysis of the clinical samples. We were able to identify host 213 nucleic acids in all of the samples, and over 95% of total reads were from the host in sputum, 214 nasal, and throat samples ( Supplementary Fig. 4a ). Virus contributed to less than 5% of 215 reads in anal swab and throat swab while more than 50% of reads in nasal swab (Supple-216 mentary Fig. 4b ). These results suggest nasal swab could be the most ideal sample type for 217 viral detection among the four sample types, which agrees with recent clinical evidence 25 . 218\n\nAmong the viral reads, over 90% were Coronaviridae, which is consistent with clinical diag-219 nostics ( Supplementary Fig. 4c ).

Compared with direct metatranscriptomic sequencing, high 240 sensitivity of hybrid capture and amplicon sequencing methods come at a price of low ac-241 curacy, and neither of the two can be used to sequence highly diverse or recombinant vi-242 ruses because the primers and probes are specific to known viral genomes. Amplicon se-243 quencing compromises its accuracy, while it becomes the most convenient and economical 244 method of all. Either or a combination of the approaches described here can be chosen to 245 cope with various needs of researchers, e.g., metatranscriptomic sequencing data with in-246 sufficient coverage and depth can be pooled with hybrid capture data to generate high qual-247 ity assemblies 22 . Our research, as well as the methods elaborated here, are able to help 248 other researchers to sequence and analyze large viruses from clinical samples and thus 249 benefit investigations on the genomic epidemiology of viruses. 250 Some pros and cons described above might be specific to the experimental workflows and 251 bioinformatics pipelines tailored in this study, e.g., 1) the bias of amplicon sequencing can 252 be improved by reducing the amount of cycles in the 1st PCR or optimize the molar ratios 253 of primers (Fig. 1a) , 2) the amplicon sequencing is particularly convenient compared with 254 previous counterparts since the fragmentation and library construction steps are omitted 255 for 6 min; 2) double-stranded (ds) cDNA was synthesized using random hexamers with frag-291 mented RNA; 3) ds cDNA was subjected to end repair, adaptor ligation, and 18-cycle PCR 292 amplification; 4) PCR products were Unique Dual Indexed (UDI), before going through cir- 100 nt strategy using the same protocol described above, generating 37 Gb sequencing 305 data for each sample on average. 306\n\nTotal RNA was reverse transcribed to synthesize the first-strand cDNA with random 308 hexamers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). \n\nFor metatranscriptomic and hybrid capture sequencing data, total reads were first processed 332 by Kraken v0.10.5 26 (default parameters) with a self-build database of Coronaviridae ge-333 nomes (including SARS, MERS and HCoV-19 genome sequences downloaded from 334 GISAID, NCBI and CNGB) to efficiently identify candidate viral reads with a loose manner. 335\n\nThese candidate reads were further qualified with fastp v0.19.5 27 (parameters: -q 20 -u 20 -336 n 1 -l 50) and SOAPnuke v1.5.6 28 (parameters: -l 20 -q 0.2 -E 50 -n 0.02 -5 0 -Q 2 -G -d) to 337 remove low-quality reads, duplications and adaptor contaminations. Low-complexity reads 338 were next filtered by PRINSEQ v0.20.4 29 (parameters: -lc_method dust -lc_threshold 7). 339\n\nAfter the above process, HCoV-19-like reads generated from metatranscriptomics and 340 hybrid capture method were obtained. 341 Amplicon sequencing data were processed as described above, except that duplications 371\n\nwere not removed. A heatmap was generated to visualize the viral genome coverage for all 372 samples sequenced by the amplicon method with the pheatmap 37 package in R (v3.6.1) 36 . 373\n\nThe depth at each nucleotide position was binarized, and was shown in pink if the depth 374 was 100x and above. 375 376 .

For 381 comparisons of the coverage and depth of the viral genome across samples and methods, 382\n\nwe normalized the viral reads to total sequencing reads with HCoV-19 Reads Per Million 383 (HCoV-19-RPM). HCoV-19-RPM for amplicon sequencing data was calculated by the same 384 pipelines we applied for metatranscriptomic and hybrid capture sequencing data. 385\n\nTo estimate the minimum data requirements for genome assembling and intra-individual 386 variation analysis, we applied gradient-based sampling to the HCoV-19 genome align-387 ments (referred to BAM files) to each dataset using Samtools (v1.9) 34 For amplicon sequencing data, only base positions covered by \u2265100X reads were used for 417 iSNVs calling. For metatranscriptomic and hybrid capture-based sequencing data, the 418 thresholds of depth were set as 10X and 20X, respectively. The candidate iSNVs were fur-419\n\nther filtered for quality as follows: 1) frequency filtering, only minor alleles (frequency \u2265 5% 420 and <50%) and major alleles (frequency \u2265 50% and \u2264 95%) were remained; 2) depth filter-421 ing, iSNVs with fewer than five forward or reverse reads were removed; and 3) strand bias 422 filtering (not applicable to single-end reads of amplicon sequencing), iSNVs were removed 423 if there were more than a 10-fold strand bias or a 5-fold difference between the strand bias 424 of the variant call and that of the reference call. 425\n\nFor metatranscriptomic sequencing of clinical samples, raw sequencing data of a single se-427 quence lane (approximately 60-75 Gb per sample) was used to simultaneously assess the 428 RNA expression patterns of human, bacteria and viruses in clinical samples from COVID-429 19 patients. We first used software fastp (v0.19.5) 27 to filter low-quality reads and remove 430 adapter with parameters: -5 -3 -q 20 -c -l 30. After QC, we mapped high-quality reads to 431 hg19 and removed human ribosomal RNA (rRNA) reads by SOAP2 v2.21 42 (parameters: -432 m 0 -x 1000 -s 28 -l 32 -v 5 -r 1), and the remaining RNA reads were then aligned to hg19 433 by HISAT2 43 with default settings to identify non-rRNA human transcripts as previously de-434 scribed.
