{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Evidence for gastrointestinal infection of SARS-CoV-2 Evidence for gastrointestinal infection of SARS-CoV-2", "body": "Since the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019, the virus has spread to 32 countries, infecting more than 80000 people and causing over 2600 deaths globally. The viral infection causes a series of respiratory illness including severe respiratory syndrome, indicating the virus most likely infects respiratory epithelial cells and spreads mainly via respiratory tract from human to human. However, viral target cells and organs haven't been fully determined, impeding our understanding of the pathogenesis of the viral infection and viral transmission routes. According to a recent case report, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in a stool specimen [1] , raising the question of viral gastrointestinal infection and fecal-oral transmission route. It has been proved that SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a viral receptor for entry process [2] . ACE2 mRNA is highly expressed and stabilized by B 0 AT1 in gastrointestinal system [3, 4] , providing a prerequisite for SARS-CoV-2 infection. To further investigate the clinical significance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces, we examined the viral RNA in feces from 71 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection during their hospitalization. The viral RNA and viral nucleocapsid protein were examined in gastrointestinal tissues from one of the patients.\n\nFrom February 1 to 14, 2020, clinical specimens including serum, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, urine, stool and tissues from 73 SARS-CoV-2-infected hospitalized patients were obtained in accordance with China Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines and tested for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the China CDC-standardized quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay [5] . Clinical characteristics of the 73 patients were shown in Supplementary Table 1 Gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed on a patient as described in Supplementary Case Clinical Information. As shown in Figure 1 , the mucous epithelium of esophagus, stomach, duodenum and rectum showed no significant damage with H&E staining.\n\nInfiltrate of occasional lymphocytes was observed in esophageal squamous epithelium.\n\nIn lamina propria of stomach, duodenum and rectum, numerous infiltrating plasma cells and lymphocytes with interstitial edema were seen.\n\nImportantly, viral host receptor ACE2 stained positive mainly in the cytoplasm of gastrointestinal epithelial cells ( Figure 1 ). To note, we observed that ACE2 is rarely expressed in esophageal epithelium, but abundantly distributed in cilia of glandular epithelia. Staining of viral nucleocapsid protein (NP) was visualized in the cytoplasm of gastric, duodenal and rectum glandular epithelial cell, but not in esophageal epithelium. The positive staining of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 was also observed in gastrointestinal epithelium from other patients, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces (data not shown).\n\nIn this manuscript, we provide evidence for gastrointestinal infection of SARS-CoV-2 and its possible fecal-oral transmission route. Since viruses spread from infected to uninfected cells [6] , viral specific target cells or organs are determinants of viral transmission routes. Receptor-mediated viral entry into a host cell is the first step of viral infection. Our immunofluorescent data showed that ACE2 protein, which has been proved to be a cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelia, supporting the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells. ACE2 staining is rarely seen in esophageal mucosa probably because esophageal epithelium is mainly composed of squamous epithelial cells, which express less ACE2 than glandular epithelial cells. \n\nEsophageal, gastric, duodenal and rectal tissues were obtained using endoscopy on day 10. Samples were embedded with Paraffin and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For immunofluorescent staining, 3 \u00b5m-thick sections were dewaxed in xylene, rehydrated in alcohol, and washed in distilled water 3 times before microwave repair.\n\nFollowing washing three times in phosphate-buffered saline with Tween (PBST), sections were incubated with 10% goat serum in PBST for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies (anti-ACE2, Sino Biological, 10108-T56, 1:500; anti-NP, Sino Biological, 40143-T62, 1:500). The slides were incubated with secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor\u00ae647-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, bs-0296G-AF647, Bioss, 1:100) for 1 h at room temperature followed by washing three times with PBST. Nuclei were then counterstained with 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) after washing three times with PBST. Slides were imaged using a laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSM880, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging)."}
