{"title": "PASSERINE AND SOFTBILL THERAPEUTICS", "body": "Toucans, or ramphastids, are neotropical birds and are grouped in three general categories: the large toucans, the smaller toucanettes, and the small and slender aracaris. Ramphastids are distinguished by a large, elongated bill, which varies in coloration from black to multicolored. Only a few species are seen in captivity, including the Toco toucan (Ramphastos taco) and the sulphur-breasted or keel-billed toucan (R. sulfuratus ).\n\nEven with the increasing amount of pharmacokinetic data in birds, the use of extrapolated drug regimens continues to be common practice for these species. This extrapolation, using allometric scaling from hu man, mammalian, and avian drugs to passeriformes and softbills, is complicated and has its limits. Most of the patients belonging to the passeriformes and softbills (nonpasserine) have a low bodyweight (BW). This low BW, combined with these birds' high \ufffdasal metabolic rates (BMRs), make accurate dosage of therapeutics important.\n\nMost formularies for pet birds are based on information derived from studies in poultry, parrots, or pigeons. The advised individual dosages and drinking water concentrations can be considered to be based on an average bodyweight of 400 g to 500 g and a drinking water intake of 40 to 60 ml/kg BW for birds of about 500 grams. 1 \u2022 6 Average BMR is expressed by the formula BMR (kcal) = K(W k g 075 ). The BMR of the passerine bird (K = 129) is 50% to 60% higher than those of nonpasserines (K = 78) of the same body size. 10 \u2022 16 This knowledge should be used to calculate a dosage regimen; in this article the dosages are expressed in mg/kcal. For a quick reference, the conversion of BW (g) to basal metabolism (kcal/ day) is presented in Table 1 .\n\nThe calculation of the concentration for drinking water medication should be based on the daily water intake. Although some desert passer ines (e.g., zebra finches) have been known to survive months without drinking water, the smallest passerine birds drink from 250 to 300 ml/ kg BW daily and can eat up to 30% of their BW daily. 1 3 This is much more than the generally advised 40 to 60 ml/kg BW for larger parrots. 1 For an average parrot of 500 g with a basal metabolism of 46 kcal/ day, the amount is about 0.5 ml/kcal/ day. It might be wise to use this amount of total water intake as a starting point for these small birds. Using the dose in mg/kcal and a drinking water intake of 0.5 ml/kcal, the drug concentration per liter will be independent of the species and therefore the same for all birds (Tables 2 and 3 ). This is a good starting point when no experimental data are available. The daily water con sumption, however, is very much influenced by environmental tempera ture, type of diet (e.g., fruits), and original habitat of the bird (desert). When using this information for calculating the drinking water concen tration for the treatment of flocks of finches, the owner should always 10  4  2  155  32  19  480  74  45  11  4  3  160  33  20  490  76  46  12  5  3  165  33  20  500  77  46  13  5  3  170  34  21  520  79  48  14  5  3  175  35  21  540  81  49  15  6  3  180  36  22  560  84  50  16  6  4  185  36  22  580  86  52  17  6  4  190  37  22  600 88 53 18 6 4 measure the actual intake and adjust the concentration to reach the desired average drug intake per kcal for the birds being treated.\n\nWhen designing a treatment plan for passeriformes and softbills, one should consider housing and husbandry. In many situations it is not feasible or economically possible to recommend a treatment that pre scribes all birds in a flock to be dosed individually three or four times a day. Therefore, information about numbers of birds, combination of different species, time in the (breeding) season, and housing are essential for designing a good treatment plan. Also catching and treating softbills several times in a row can be stressful for both the owner and the birds.\n\nThe small passeriform birds are kept in captivity as individual pet birds and as flocks in aviaries. Two types of aviaries can be distin guished: mixed ornamental aviaries and breeding aviaries. The former is usually located outside, and different species are kept in it together, mostly for ornamental purposes. In the latter, large numbers of the same species are kept mostly indoors for breeding and selecting. These fanci ers often go to shows and competitions, where there is an exchange of birds (and possibly pathogens).\n\nIn The large amount of moist food that these birds (mynahs and toucans) consume results not only in the production of voluminous and malodorous excrement but also makes treatment through the drinking water difficult. This is possible only when the amount of moist food is Based on the dosage in mg / kcal (BMR -KW' \") and a water intake of 0.5 mg / kcal. The calculated dose should preferably be divided over water and food.\n\n\"'Calculated for amoxycillin part only. tln case of omithosis for 30 days. :J:Metabolic dose estimated from drinking water concentration. \u00a7In case of omithosis for 21 days. IIF or the treatment of Candida albicans for 3 to 6 wk. ,!This dosage is for the trimethoprim part alone.\n\nheavily reduced or the medication is given through a finely chopped fruit mix.\n\nEven though many veterinarians like to treat the small passerines with drugs preferably in the drinking water, in many cases it is better to handle individual or small numbers of birds and apply the medication directly. The route can be oral or intramuscular.\n\nA \"lights out/ perching out\" approach to capture is often useful for small active birds. Birds generally do not move in a dark room and can be removed easily from an enclosure. The bird can be restrained by placing the head between two fingers so that the body rests in the palm of the hand, or it can be restrained by holding the head gently between the thumb and first finger. One must never interfere or restrict the movement of the sternum because this will kill the bird. The handling and restraint period must be as short as possible. One should be pre pared to take samples and deliver treatment in one handling session. For anesthesia, only isoflurane is acceptable, and one should use an adapted mask to induce the anesthesia. Ve ry active finches needing frequent treatments can be caught more easily in a small hospital cage (i.e., plastic-bottomed hamster cage). If such a cage is loaned to the owner, it can increase treatment compliance because it often reduces stress for the patient and the owner. It also increases the number of birds returning for follow-up.\n\nMynahs and toucans can be loud, active, and aggressive, particu larly if untamed. Tame birds that are not given sufficienJ: attention can also become aggressive toward their keepers. The birds are best re strained by initially removing them from the enclosure with a net or large towel. A toucan can then be controlled by holding the beak in one hand and using a towel loosely wrapped around the body to control the wings and feet. A mynah is controlled by holding the head gently between the thumb and first finger. The towel can be used as with toucans. Toucans should never be handled by the head and neck alone. 3\n\nWhen there is a good indication, the right jugular vein and intraos seus catheterization can be used for administration of intravenous fluids using a 26-gauge needle. This is a seldom-practiced method of fluid administration in finches. 1 3 In toucans, this approach is comparable to that used in psittacines.\n\nFor intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SC) injections, a 27-gauge needle on a 1-mL insulin syringe is required, and even these can cause significant hemorrhage if not used with caution. Intramuscular injections into the pectoral muscle must be made more carefully than in other species. A small amount of alcohol with 10% glycerine is used for visualizing the site before attempting an IM injection. To minimize risk, the IM injection site should be located in the caudal third of the breast muscle. Aspiration should be performed prior to injecting any drug to ensure that a blood vessel has not been cannulated. After the needle has been removed, the site should be observed for hemorrhage, and pressure should be applied digitally if bleeding does occur. Drug dosing in small patients must be based on an exact BW (as determined by a gram scale) and should be delivered with precise microliter or insulin syringes to avoid overdose. There is little room for a dosing error in a small bird.11 The volume of the injected fluid must be carefully monitored in these small species; 0.1 ml in a canary of 20 g is comparable to 3 L in a cow of 600 kg.\n\nDirect oral application has the advantage of precise dosing, and, because many drugs are available as oral suspensions in fl avored pediat ric strengths, dosing is easy. When a sick bird requires handfeeding, these drugs can easily be added to the feeding formula. Remember that the smaller finches and canaries will die within 24 hours from hypoglycemia when they do not eat at all.7 Tablets or capsules are impractical for the small birds but can be used in toucans and mynahs.\n\nApplication of drugs in the drinking water is a common route of administration in small birds. In many cases the water intake will be substantially reduced. Normal water intake is irregularly spread over the day, which can result in irregular or even ineffective blood levels. This can cause disappointing therapeutic results and the development of resistance. Medication in water can be successful against mild infec tions of the gastrointestinal tract, in which the drug has a local effect in the gut. Administration of drugs in the drinking water is particularly not recommended in softbills and fruit-eating finches because they gen erally do not consume large quantities of water; instead, they obtain most of their daily fluid requirements from fruits. Oral administration in softbills (and some larger passerines) can be administered directly, by metal or rubber gavage tube, or by placement of a capsule or granules in the center of a grape.\n\nIn flock treatment of small passerines, better therapeutic results can be achieved by administering the drug at the same time in both drinking water and soft or egg food, resulting in self-medication several times a day. It is also possible to medicate nestling birds by adding medication to the soft food that is fed by the parents to their chicks.\n\nBecause the elimination is so rapid, there often are no measurable blood levels during the night, even after oral administration through the food and water. It is possible to increase water and food intake during the night by changing to a 24-hour light regimen, which results in more evenly distributed blood levels over a period of 24 hours. This change of day-night rhythm, however, disturbs breeding and can induce molting. Antibiotics must be administered for at least 7 days, and bactericide antibiotics are preferred above bacteriostatics.\n\nThe calculation of the drinking water concentration should be based on the daily water intake (0.5 ml/ kcal/ day) and the dose (mg/kcal/ day). The most commonly used medications are presented in Table 3 , relative to different BW ranges; however, the actual daily water intake should always be measured and the drug concentration adjusted to these results.\n\nTreatment of skin or leg lesions with ophthalmic ointments often results in intoxication and the death of the patient. Because a few drops swallowed during cleaning its feathers is sufficient to kill the bird, the owner should be instructed to apply the ointment sparingly or to put a collar on the bird.\n\nChlorhexidine topical cream is not recommended because it has been associated with averse reactions in Mannihin species and parrot finches.\n\nSome drugs (i.e., dimetridazole [Emtryl] and sulfa de!ivatives) will, at poultry-or pigeon-dose levels, cause toxic signs.\n\nFor the optimal treatment of infectious diseases, the clinician must be certain of the diagnosis, sensitivity of the organism to the drug, and toxic properties, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. Knowledge of husbandry practices and anatomic and physiologic differences of the species to be treated are also essential. Supportive care and minimizing stress are necessary to maintain the host's defense mechanisms.\n\nEssential for the success of any therapy is to locate the source of the problem and eliminate or modify it. This can also include decontamina tion of the environment of the bird (e.g., cage or aviary).\n\nUnder optimal conditions, the selection of an antimicrobial therapy is based on sensitivity testing; however, it is becoming more obvious that the line between sensitive and insensitive in avian medicine could be different from the accepted standard in human and mammalian medicine. One reason for this is that the attainable blood levels for many drugs could be lower in birds than in mammals for the same drugs owing to short elimination half-lives, different bioavailability, or different administration routes. If a test indicates an organism to be susceptible, then treatment might be successful if drug concentrations similar to those in humans were achieved in birds. 9 In avian medicine, the sensitiv ity of the microorganism should be reported as a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) in a dilution test, and, when the pharmacokinetics of the drug of choice and the concentration at the site of action are known, an effective therapy can be expected.\n\nA therapeutic blood level (or a concentration above the bacterial MIC) is important for bacteriostatic antibiotics during most of the dosage interval, which in these small birds is difficult to achieve for many of the selected drugs. There is therefore a preference for the use of bacteri cidal drugs, in which adequate peak concentrations have a good lasting therapeutic effect. 9 In infectious disease cases, whether proved or sus pected, or when there is bacterial involvement, it is essential to start treatment immediately, sometimes even before the results of the sensitiv ity test are known. When the results of the sensitivity test become available, it is sometimes necessary to switch to another drug. Before any antimicrobial therapy is started the cause should be determined, whether gram-positive cocci, gram-negative bacteria, chla mydia, or yeast. A parasitic infestation-coccidia, flagellates, nematodes, cestodes, or trematodes-should be sought. A direct smear from the feces or impression smears from the organs at necropsy, air dried and stained with simple stains (e.g., Quick hematological stains) gives mor phologic information of the microorganisms present. In many cases a parasitic infection can be diagnosed with simple wet-mount examination of a crop or cloacal swab. Table 4 displays treatment suggestions based on the results of these tests, the compiled result of the author's diagnos tic laboratory, and references from literature.\n\nAntimicrobial susceptibility patterns vary geographically, so that these data might not be applicable to all areas. 9 An alternative for the treatment of flocks infected with gram-nega tive bacteria (e.g., Salmonella spp. or Yersinia pseudotuberculosis) is en rofloxacin.4 For individual treatment, some additional antimicrobials are available for use in SC or IM injections. For gram-negative bacteria, one can use amikacin, cephalosporins, and piperacillin; for gram-positive bacteria, cephalexin and cephalothin. \n\nNutritional problems, especially those resulting from an unbalanced diet, are often seen in mixed aviaries and individual pet canaries. All granivorous birds need a certain amount of supplementation by an egg food or softbill food because a deficient diet compromises the defense mechanisms and can lead to problems with Enterobacteriaceae (e.g., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Enterobacter spp.) and yeast infections ( especially Candida al bi cans) in these birds. Breeding results are also disappointing in birds with an unbalanced diet. A good starting point for therapy is controlled feeding of three parts of a seed mix supple mented with one part soft food, or changing to a complete pelleted food.\n\nIn small passerines, feeding rancid cod liver oil or mixing oil through the seed can result in encephalomalacia anJ fertility problems owing to vitamin E deficiency. Vitamin B deficieney can cause CNS disturbances, reduced hatching, stunting, and molting problems. 15 ,000 IU /kg egg food for \"normal\" canaries to approximately 20,000 IU /kg egg food, to prevent deficiency problems.\n\nVitamin C is not normally needed as a dietary source because most birds can synthesize sufficient amounts from glucose in the liver, kidney, or both.11 Some species of passeriformes lack the enzyme L-gulonolactone oxidase and require a dietary source of vitamin C. Passerines, which depend on external sources for vitamin C (e.g., bulbuls, shrikes), when fed a deficient diet, develop symptoms within 15 days, including weight loss, behavioral changes, lethargy, feather loss, and hemorrhage in the liver and leg joints. The daily requirement is unknown, but beneficial responses have been seen at levels between 50 and 150 mg/kg dry mat ter.\n\nVitamin 03 or calcium deficiency, or problems with the Ca:P ratio (resulting in rickets and osteomalacia) are incidentally seen in small passerines, but severe metabolic bone disease is often observed in ram phastid chicks. After changes in the bird's diet have been made, most affected birds regain a fairly normal-appearing bill, with only slight structural modifications. 17 . Hemochrom atosis, or iron storage disease, is the commonest noninfectious disease in softbills. In passeriformes, storage in hepatocytes is seen onl_Y in mynahs. In these birds, diets with more than 50 ppm to 60 ppm of iron can induce a liver iron storage problem. Therefore, diets with a total iron intake of less than 50 ppm should be fed to mynahs and toucans. The daily intake of iron, in other words, should be 4 to 6 mg / kg for each bird per day. An effective treatment of weekly phlebotomies to remove a blood volume equivalent to 1 % of BW is usually performed in conjunction with low iron diets. A less-invasive treatment is docu mented using deferoxamine (100 mg/kg g24hr, SC) combined with a low iron diet (65 ppm) for periods up to 4 months until the iron content in the liver of the toucan normalized. 3 Diabetes mellitus is seen in toucans th at demonstrate classic signs, and affected birds often respond to daily or intermittent insulin (0.1-0.5 U) injections. 17\n\nMany infectious diseases are species specific, although salmonellosis and pseudotuberculosis are exceptions. Coccidiosis is often diagnosed in finches, but transmission of the infection between species is not very likely because most species appear to have their own coccidian species.\n\nReported viral infections in passeriformes or softbills are avian pox, polyomavirus, paramyxovirus (PMV-1, PMV-2, and PMV-3), herpesvirus and cytomegalovirus, influenzavirus, adenovirus, coronavirus, and cir covirus. In most cases, there is no specific therapy.\n\nAvian p ox. Av ian pox is especially seen in passerines kept in captivity-almost exclusively in canaries and other Serinus sp.-but also in young, recently imported mynahs. 12 Preventive vaccination is possible by the wing-web method, preferably in early summer. The vaccination must be repeated once every year. In case of an epidemic, all birds are to be caged individually, or, if this is impossible, in small groups. All clinically healthy birds should be vaccinated, and supportive treatment consists of the administration of antibiotics and multivitamin prepara tions. Two weeks after mortality has stopped, the birds can be housed again in the flypens.\n\nParam y xovirus. Several paramyxoviruses have been reported in mynahs and toucans, including PMV-1 (ND), PMV-2, and PMV-3.17 PMV-3 is often found in passeriformes. A preventive vaccination for PMV-1 with an inactivated vaccine is possible.\n\nTreatment with acyclovir is possible for herpesvirus and cytomega lovirus. Dosage in small birds has not been tested, however.\n\nCommon bacterial infections in passeriformes and softbills are Esch erichia coli (and other Enterobacteriaceae), Ye rsinia pseudotuberculosis, Sal monella sp., Campylobacter sp., Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp., Pseudomonas and Aeromonas spp., Mycobacterium-avium-intracellulare-com plex and M. genavense, Chlamydia psittaci, Mycoplasma spp., and mega bacteria.\n\nThese bacteria, however, are often demonstrated by cytology and can be isolated from the feces or from the intestinal contents of diseased passer ine birds, with and without diarrhea. In toucans, E. coli (and Staphylococ cus sp. and Streptococcus serotype D) were found in the cloaca of 90% of clinically normal toucans. 2 Other primary diseases can be present (e.g., atoxoplasmosis or coccidiosis ). Cultures are necessary for diagnosis, and a sensitivity test is essential for treatment. Treatment does improve this condition but only temporarily; the clinician must search for the real cause.\n\nEnterobacteriaceae. Enterobacteriaceae are regularly cultured from birds with diarrhea (usually in passerine nestlings, termed sweating disease). The antibiotics of choice are neomycin or sj::,ectinomycin because they are effective and not absorbed from the gut. Tl}e drug is adminis tered in the soft food. In fledglings, extra water, in chopped greens and vegetables, prevents dehydration.\n\nYersiniosis (Pseudotuberculosis). In Europe, an infection with Ye r sinia pseudotuberculosis is regularly seen in winter in canaries and wild finches. Mynahs, but especially toucans, are very susceptible for yersin iosis, and the mortality rate can be high. Treatment of choice is amoxycil lin in the drinking water or soft food. In softbills, individual treatment is advised. Once sensitivity test results are obtained, the antibiotic some times must be changed. Cleaning and disinfection are essential to pre vent a relapse after therapy has been completed. In Europe, a formal vaccine is available that appears to be clinically effective in reducing the prevalence of infections.\n\nSalmonellosis. The most effective antibiotics against salmonellosis are trimethoprim (with or without sulfa), amoxycillin, or enrofloxacin, given for 2 to 3 weeks. Therapy must be combined with strict hygiene. Three to six weeks after therapy, a bacteriologic examination of a pooled fecal sample in enrichment medium should be performed to evaluate the success of the therapy. When necessary, therapy and hygienic meas ures should be repeated until the bacteriologic control stays negative.\n\nCampylobacter fetus. Campylobacter fe tus (subsp. jejuni) is found very often in tropical finches, especially in Estrildidae. Campylobacter sp. have also been isolated from recently imported mynahs. Treatment can be attempted with several antibiotics, but hygienic measures are most important. Although campylobacteriosis is considered a potential zoono sis, no data are available of Campylobacter transmission from passerines to humans. .\n\nPseud omonas and Aeromonas spp. Treatment includes locating the sour ce of the trouble and administering an antibiotic after performing a sensitivity test. Until the results are available, the first-choice antibiotic in these \ufffdases is enrofloxacin. Painstaking hygiene is essential, because manv strains are resistant to antibiotic treatment.\n\nAvian Tub erculosis. Treatment of tuberculosis is not often practiced. There is a potential for zoonosis, although mostly in only immunocom promised persons. The cages must be cleaned and disinfected. The bacteria can survive in the infected soil for 2 years.\n\nOrnithosis (Chlamydiosis). This is a relatively uncommon problem in passerines and softbills. Treatment with chlortetracycline (30 days), doxycycline (30 days), or enrofloxacin (21 days) in drinking water and (soft) food is clinically effective, but only when the birds continue to drink the normal amount of water and Ca 2 + is restricted.\n\nMycoplasma spp. Mycoplasma have been isolated from canaries, and many cases of conjunctivitis and upper respiratory disease in canaries respond to tylosin; however, there has been no conclusive work proving that Mycoplasma is associated with this syndrome. Tetracyclines and enrofloxacin are believed to be effective against many Mycoplasma spp. 13 Clinical signs of conjunctivitis in house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) associated with M. gallisepticum infection resolved following oral tylosin\n\n(1 mg/mL drinking water for at least 21 days) as the sole source of drinking water in conjunction with topical ciprofloxacin HCI ophthalmic solution for 5 to 7 days. 14 Other Bacterial Infections. The following bacteria are occasionally isolated from deceased passerine and softbill birds: Erysipelothrix rhusio pathia, Lis teria monocytogenes, and Pasteurella multocida (from a cat bite?;\n\nfirst-choice antibiotic is amoxycillin / clavulanic acid).\n\nMegabacteria. These are large, rod-shaped organisms that have fungal characteristics and have been found in the proventriculus or droppings of several avian species and are associated with wasting disease. Therapy must be aimed at improving the bird's condition, including providing easily digestible food (egg food) and lowering the pH in the proventriculus (6 mL O.lN HCI/L or citric acid 1 g/L) to activate pepsin. In vitro studies have shown that the organism isolated from budgerigars is sensitive to several antibiotics; 15 in budgerigars oral amphotericin B and in European finches oral nystatin were both shown to be effective. 8 After 6 weeks, birds can be returned to a normal diet, which should include regularly egg food as a supplement.\n\nMycotic infections are not a significant problem in canaries but are much commoner in tropical finches, mynahs and, toucans.\n\nCandidiasis. Identifying candida in fecal smears from passerines should be done with caution because many passeriformes are fed yeast products. The intestinal candidiasis is treated with nystatin for 3 to 6 weeks at a dose of 100,000 IU / L of drinking water and 200,000 IU / kg soft food. Eye lesions and dermatitis can be treated with IV and topical amphotericin B. Other predisposing factors (e.g., nutritional defiencies, immune suppression) should be addressed as well.\n\nFungi. Aspergillosis is an uncommon finding in small passerines and piciformes. In captive mynahs, however, Aspergillus infections are much commoner. In some cases (e.g., syrinx aspergillomas or localized air sac involvement), surgery is indicated. In chronic cases, medical therapy has a poor prognosis. As preventive measures, adequate vitamin A supplementation and improvement in hygiene (including ventilation) are indicated.\n\nDermatomycosis. Dermatomycosisis is occasionally reported in pas serines and generally causes alopecia of the head and neck, or hyperker atosis. Microsporum sp. and Trichophyton sp. are the commonest causes, but saprophytic fungi also can be involved. Zoonotic factors need to be considered. Treatment with ketoconazole and griseofulvin provides some improvement but does not always eliminate the infection.\n\nOther Mycotic Infections. Other mycotic infections reported in passerines include Cryptococcus neoformans, though it is very rarely seen in these birds, and zygomycosis (mucormycosis), which is reported in the lung, liver, or brain of canaries and finches as multiple granulomas. The incidents were related to feeding damp, germinated \ufffdeeds.13\n\nThe most important protozoa! infections in canaries are atoxo plasmosis, coccidiosis, toxoplasmosis, and trichomoniasis. Atoxo plasma-like infections and cryptosporidiosis are found only occasionally in finches, starlings, and mynahs and are mostly restricted to individual birds. (In these birds it is seldom a flock problem.) Coccidiosis, cochlo somosis, and trichomoniasis are very common in finches. In softbills, Giardia spp. and coccidiosis are occasionally noted in fecal examination or postmortem.\n\nAtoxoplasmosis (Isospora serini). This is a systemic coccidial dis ease in canaries and other finches. Atoxoplasmosis and hemochromatosis are the primary medical problems in captive Bali mynahs. The therapeu tic agent of choice is sulfachlorpyrazine, 150 mg/L of drinking water, until after molting for 5 days a week. This treatment effects only the production of oocysts but does not influence the intracellular stages. Other measurements to improve health of young birds include feeding one part egg food and one part seed mixture until after molting, preven tion of crowding, and better hygiene, especially cleaning and changing the floor coating. These measurements alone can prevent clinical out breaks in infected canaries. This infection is also a common problem in other European finches kept in captivity (e.g., goldfinch, siskin, green finch, and bullfinch).\n\nCoccidiosis. Coccidia, Isospora sp., and less common Eimeria sp. are frequently encountered in passeriformes and toucans. Therapy con sists of strict hygiene measures and treatment with coccidiostatic drugs. Amprolium solution has been recommended for the treatment of coccidi-osis at a dosage of 50 to 100 mg/L for 5 days or longer. Another treatment is sulfachlorpyrazine 300 mg /L of drinking water, 5 days a week for 2 to 3 weeks.\n\nToxoplasmosis. In the acute phase of toxoplasmosis, the birds (ca naries and mynahs) can show severe respiratory signs; in the chronic form, iridocyclitis or panophthalmia are noted. No effective treatment is known, although some effect is claimed for toltrazuril.\n\nTrichomonas. This and other flagellates are commonly seen in the crop of passerines. In mynahs, the lesions look like trichomoniasis in pigeons, with typical lesions in the beak. Treatment consists of ronida zole at 400 mg/kg of egg food and 400 mg/L of drinking water for 5 days. After a pause of 2 days, the regimen is repeated. This drug is relatively safe, and no toxic signs have been seen. If dimetridazole is used, the concentration should not exceed 100 mg active drug per liter for 5 days. A sign of intoxication is torticollis, which will disappear after the medication is stopped. Metronidazole has also been reported to cause toxicity in finches. Water containers should be disinfected and rinsed clean, and the aviary should be kept clean and dry.\n\nCochlosoma sp. This is a flagellate living in the intestinal tract of society finches. Cochlosoma can cause death among Australian finches fostered by these society finches. Treatment is the same as for other flagellates.\n\nGiardia sp. Giardia sp. has been reported to be associated with gastrointestinal tract infections in finches. In toucans, Giardia is fre quently identified in fecal samples but with no associated clinical dis ease.2 Treatment is the same as for other flagellates.\n\nBlood Parasites. These can be detected on routine screening of apparently healthy passerines and ramphastids, but they are occasionally implicated as the primary cause of disease or death. The most commonly encountered parasites include Haemoproteus sp., Leucocytozoon sp., Try pa11oso1 1 1a sp., Plasnwdium sp. (malaria), and microfilaria.\n\nPlasmodium sp. The cause of avian malaria, Plasmodium sp. are mosquito-borne protozoa that occur worldwide. Treatment with chlo roquine (250 mg / 120 mL of drinking water for 1 to 2 weeks) or pyri methamine is successful in some cases, but a lasting immunity does not occur. Another protocol is chloroquine 0.54 mg/ kcal PO at O hom\ufffd then 0.33 mg / kcal PO at 12, 24, and 48 hours, with pyrimethamine 0.011 to 0.022 mg / kcal at O hour. 1 Control of mosquito vectors is necessary to prevent infection.\n\nHaemoproteus spp. These organisms are found worldwide but cause only mild or inapparent clinical symptoms. Treatment is seldom indicated and is identical to treatment for avian malaria.\n\nLeucoc y tozoon sp. These organisms also occur worldwide and can infect either erythrocytes or leukocytes. Most infections are subclinical, although vague signs and even death have been reported.\n\nWorms are usually of no significance in small passerines. Acantho cephalans, cestodes, and nematodes have mostly been reported in free- \n\nEctoparasites. Ectoparasites, including blood-sucking mites (Derma nyssus gallinae and Ornitlwnyssus sylviarum), skin mites (e.g., Backericheyla sp. and Neocheyletiella media) and feather mites (e.g., Epidermotidae, Dermation spp.) have been found in the calamus of the feathers. Meal mites (Tyroglyphus fa rinae) are not parasites, but their large number on a bird can cause unrest and irritation.\n\nBlood-Sucking Mites. The red mite (Dermanyssus gallinae) and the white or Northern mite (Ornithonyssus sylviarum) can cause serious mor tality among fledglings as well as adult birds. Treatment should be prompt and consists of dusting or spraying the victims with an insecti cide and vacating and thoroughly cleaning the cage or room during the day. A relatively safe method for treating Ornithonyssus sylviarum is putting one drop of 0.1 % ivermectin in propylene glycol on the bare skin (spot-on method); however, the mites are killed only after sucking blood.\n\nExcept some irritation or feather damage, other ectoparasites cause no real disease problems; however, they are considered a sign of inade quate hygiene and management.\n\nQuill Mites. Quill mites have been described in passerines. Treat ment with ivermectin (spot-on method) is very effective.\n\nKnemidokoptes Pilae. Knemidokoptes pilae infections, or scaly mites, are occasionally seen on the beak base of finches. Treatment with any oil or ivermectin applied locally cures the bird.\n\nAir Sac Mites (Sternostoma tracheacolum). Found occasionally in canaries, these mites are seen mostly in Australian finches. They are not reported in softbills. Several therapeutic regimens have been described for air sac mite infestations. Pest strips make a reasonably good air sac mite preventive, provided that the bird cannot get to them, and only if the bird is not within a small enclosure. Ivermectin can be used for individual treatment by a spot-on method."}
