{"title": "Porcine deltacoronavirus: Overview of infection dynamics, diagnostic methods, prevalence and genetic evolution", "body": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the subfamily Coronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae within the order Nidovirales. Four genera have thus far been described in the subfamily Coronavirinae and these include: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus (Masters and Perlman, 2013) . Five porcine CoVs have been recognized: transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in the Alphacoronavirus genus; porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) in the Betacoronavirus genus; and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) in the Deltacoronavirus genus.\n\nPorcine deltacoronavirus was first detected in pig samples collected in 2009 in Hong Kong during a molecular surveillance study (Woo et al., 2012) . But the clinical significance of PDCoV was not addressed in that study. In February 2014, emergence of PDCoV in U.S. swine was reported and the virus rapidly spread to multiple states in the U.S. Marthaler et al., 2014a,b; Wang et al., 2014a,b,c) . Shortly thereafter, PDCoV was detected in the South Korean swine population (Lee and Lee, 2014) . Recently PDCoV has also been detected in mainland China and Thailand (Chen et al., 2015a; Janetanakit et al., 2016; Song et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015) . PDCoV was reported to be associated with naturally infected clinical cases that were presented with severe diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration in piglets (Janetanakit et al., 2016; Li et al., 2014; Song et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2014a) together with histopathological lesions typical for atrophic enteritis . Experimental infection studies have confirmed that conventional and gnotobiotic piglets inoculated with PDCoV developed mild to severe diarrhea, gross and microscopic intestinal lesions (Chen et al., 2015b; Jung et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2015) .\n\nPDCoV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a genome of appropriately 25 kb in length. The PDCoV genome organization and nucleotide locations are depicted in Fig. 1 . The genome arrangements are in the order of: 5 untranslated region (UTR), open reading frame 1a/1b (ORF1a/1b), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nonstructural protein 6 (NS6), nucleocapsid (N), nonstructural protein 7 (NS7), and 3 UTR. The functions of PDCoV individual proteins have not been elucidated. But according to studies on other CoVs, the replicase polyproteins 1a (pp1a) and pp1ab are generally cleaved by virus-encoded proteases into 16 non-structural proteins involved in viral transcription and replication (Masters and Perlman, 2013) . Among the structural proteins, the S glycoprotein of CoVs generally functions in receptor binding, cell membrane fusion and entry; in addition, the S protein is postulated to harbor epitopes to induce neutralizing antibodies. In regards to molecular characterization of PDCoV, the whole genome sequences and/or S and N gene sequences have been frequently used for phylogenetic analysis (Homwong et al., 2016; Janetanakit et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2016; Song et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2014a) . The S, M and N protein genes have also been targeted for the development of virological and serological diagnostic assays for PDCoV (Chen et al., 2015b; Ma et al., 2015; Marthaler et al., 2014b; Song et al., 2015; Su et al., 2015; Thachil et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2014a) .\n\nClinical symptoms of PDCoV infection can include diarrhea, dehydration, variable vomiting and mortality in neonatal piglets; these clinical manifestations are similar to other swine enteric pathogens such as PEDV and TGEV. Thus specific laboratory diagnostic testing is imperative to differentiate PDCoV from PEDV and TGEV infection. This paper reviews PDCoV infection dynamics and appropriate sample collection for diagnostic testing as well as the commonly used virological and serological methods for PDCoV diagnosis. In addition, this article provides information known thus far on PDCoV prevalence and genetic evolution.\n\nSeveral experimentally infected studies have investigated PDCoV pathogenesis in conventional and gnotobiotic (Gn) pigs (Chen et al., 2015b; Jung et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2015) . Details of the disease mechanisms and pathogenesis of PDCoV have been reviewed in another paper (Jung et al., 2016) . Here we focus on summarizing the PDCoV infection dynamics in pigs to help understand how to collect appropriate clinical samples at the appropriate time for diagnostic testing.\n\nIn the studies performed by Jung et al. (2015) and Ma et al. (2015) , 10-19-day-old Gn pigs were inoculated with PDCoVpositive intestinal contents or cell culture-adapted PDCoV isolates. Diarrhea and/or vomiting were observed starting from 24 h post inoculation (hpi) or 72 hpi and diarrhea persisted through 72-120 hpi when pigs were euthanized and necropsied Ma et al., 2015) . Fecal viral RNA was detected from 24 hpi and lasted through 72-120 hpi Ma et al., 2015) . Because pigs still had diarrhea and shed virus at the termination of these studies (72-120 hpi), eventual duration of diarrhea and PDCoV shedding was not determined in Gn pigs in these studies Ma et al., 2015) .\n\nIn 5-day-old conventional pigs experimentally inoculated with 3 \u00d7 10 4 TCID 50 of cell culture-adapted PDCoV USA/IL/2014 isolate, onset of diarrhea occurred on 5 days post inoculation (DPI) and lasted through 7 DPI when pigs were necropsied; viral RNA shedding in fecal swabs was detected from 2 to 7 DPI (Chen et al., 2015b) . The study was terminated at 7 DPI in efforts to adequately capture gross and microscopic lesions caused by PDCoV infection; eventual duration of diarrhea and PDCoV shedding was not determined (Chen et al., 2015b) .\n\nIn another study, four 10-day-old conventional pigs were orally inoculated with 5 ml of virus containing 10 6 PFU of PDCoV Michigan/8977/2014 isolate and monitored through 21 DPI . Diarrhea occurred on 1 DPI and persisted for 7-10 days and all four pigs recovered from disease on 10 DPI. Fecal viral RNA shedding was detected on 1-2 DPI, peaked on 7 DPI, gradually decreased after 10 DPI, but was still detectable from 1 out of 4 pigs on 21 DPI . My group has recently performed an experimental infection study where fifteen 3-week-old conventional pigs were orally inoculated with 10 5 TCID 50 of PDCoV USA/IL/2014 isolate and monitored through 42 DPI with viral RNA shedding levels examined in individual fecal swabs (fecal swabs were collected from each pig at each time point), pen-based feces (two feces were collected at each time point from the floor of the room housing all PDCoV-inoculated pigs), and pen-based oral fluids (two oral fluids were collected at each time point from the room housing all PDCoV-inoculated pigs) (unpublished data). A schematic diagram presenting PDCoV infection dynamics in nursery pigs is summa-rized in Fig. 2 . Clinical signs generally did not last over 10 days. Viral RNA shedding peaked on 7 DPI and gradually decreased thereafter no matter in individual fecal swabs, pen-based feces, or pen-based oral fluids. However, duration of viral RNA shedding in these specimen types are different. PDCoV RNA was detected through at least 14 DPI (negative on 21 DPI) in pen-based feces, at least 28 DPI (negative on 35 DPI) in individual fecal swabs, and at least 35 DPI (negative on 42 DPI) in pen-based oral fluids. PDCoV shedding patterns under field conditions have not been reported.\n\nBased on aforementioned experimental studies, recommendations on sample collections for PDCoV diagnostic testing are provided below.\n\n\u2022 Collection of fecal samples and oral fluids. PDCoV-infected pigs shed high-levels of virus during the acute infection periods (1-10 DPI); individual fecal swabs, pen-based feces, and/or pen-based oral fluids can be collected for PDCoV PCR or virus isolation (VI) testing. Oral fluids and individual fecal swabs appear to be better specimen types than pen-based feces for PCR testing when PDCoV infection is already over 10-14 days. \u2022 Serum samples for PDCoV PCR and VI testing or not? PDCoV infection can induce acute viremia (Chen et al., 2015b; Ma et al., 2015) but viremia is transient and at low-level; thus serum is not the best choice for PDCoV PCR or VI testing. \u2022 Tissue sample collections for PDCoV testing. For sick (clinical) pigs euthanized and necropsied during the acute infection phase (1-10 DPI), the small intestines especially the jejunum and ileum sections can be collected freshly for PDCoV PCR and VI testing or can be collected in 10% buffered formalin for histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) examinations. Low-levels of PDCoV RNA has been detected in other non-enteric tissues by PCR but PDCoV antigen has not been consistently detected in those non-enteric tissues by IHC or immunofluorescence staining (Chen et al., 2015b; Jung et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2015) ; therefore, non-enteric tissues are not the best choice for PDCoV diagnostic testing. \u2022 Feed or environmental samples for PDCoV testing. A number of PEDV studies have shown that contaminated trailers and feed/ingredients can serve as a vehicle to transmit PEDV (Bowman et al., 2015a; Dee et al., 2014a; Lowe et al., 2014; Pasick et al., 2014; Pillatzki et al., 2015) . Since PDCoV probably has the similar transmission routes to PEDV, environmental samples and feed are occasionally submitted for PDCoV PCR testing. \u2022 Samples for PDCoV antibody testing. No information has been published regarding dynamics of antibody responses against PDCoV infection. According to our unpublished data, PDCoV-inoculated weaned pigs started to develop low-level virus neutralizing (VN) antibody in serum on 7 DPI and VN antibody titers increased from 14 DPI and were maintained through the end of the study (42 DPI; Fig. 2 ). For PEDV, serum, oral fluid, colostrum and milk samples can be used for antibody detection; it is assumed that these specimens can also be used for PDCoV antibody detection although more research is definitely needed in these areas.\n\nPDCoV diagnostic methods can be divided into two categories: virological and serological methods. Virological methods include detection of virus particles (electron microscopy), detection of viral nucleic acid (various RT-PCRs and in situ hybridization), detection of viral antigen (immunofluorescence staining and immunohistochemistry), and detection of viable virus (virus isolation and swine bioassay). Serological assays can be used to determine previous exposure to a virus, to determine kinetics of antibody response to virus infection, and to evaluate efficacy of vaccines. The most commonly used serological assays include indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, virus neutralization (VN) test or fluorescent focus neutralization (FFN) test, enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), and fluorescent microsphere immunoassays (FMIA) although some of these assays have not been well validated for the detection of PDCoV antibodies. Table 1 summarizes the current virological and serological methods for PDCoV detection.\n\nElectron microscopy allows direct visualization of virus particles. Two EM techniques are commonly used in diagnostic laboratories: negative-stain EM for detection of virus particles in a fluid matrix; ultrathin-section EM for detection of virus particles in fixed tissues or cells. Based on characteristic morphology and size of virus particles observed under EM, viruses can be assigned to appropriate family, e.g. coronavirus-like particles were observed in some feces during initial investigation of diarrheic cases caused by PDCoV. Although EM cannot identify viruses to the species level, identification to the family level can still facilitate next-step testing to achieve definite diagnosis. However, EM generally is less sensitive and needs presence of sufficient amount of virus (about 10 5-6 virions per milliliter) in examined specimens. In addition, EM requires expensive equipment and highly skilled microscopist. EM is not a tool routinely used for PDCoV diagnostic testing.\n\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technique that can in vitro amplify specific nucleic acid sequences and produce billion copies of target sequences after 35-40 cycles of three-step process (denaturation, annealing, and extension) within a few hours. Various PCRs including pan-coronavirus RT-PCR and PDCoV-specific RT-PCRs in different formats have been used to detect PDCoV RNA in a variety of samples. Table 1 comments on the properties of these RT-PCRs and Table 2 summarizes PDCoV-specific RT-PCRs regarding the target gene, sequences of primers and probes, limit of detection, and reference papers.\n\n3.1.2.1. Pan-coronavirus (Pan-CoV) RT-PCR. Coronaviruses can infect a variety of host species and there are also quite genetic diversities among coronaviruses. However, a pan-coronavirus onestep RT-PCR targeting a conserved region (251 bp) of polymerase gene has been developed that can detect most if not all of the coronaviruses (Moes et al., 2005) . Electron microscopy together with pan-coronavirus RT-PCR followed by genetic sequencing played an important role in identifying PEDV and PDCoV during the early stage of investigating diarrheic swine cases in the United States (US) Stevenson et al., 2013) . However, pancoronavirus RT-PCR is not PEDV-or PDCoV-specific and genetic sequencing of the amplified product is needed to determine virus identity. This property together with the relatively lower sensitivity make pan-coronavirus RT-PCR not suitable for routine PDCoV diagnostic testing.\n\nPDCoV-specific RT-PCR. Several standard (also called conventional or gel-based) one-step RT-PCR or nested RT-PCR assays have been developed for the specific detection of PDCoV (Song et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2014a) . These RT-PCR assays target a conserved region of PDCoV M or N genes (Table 2) . Following PCR amplification, electrophoresis on agarose gels and visualization of amplicons under UV light are generally performed to determine the RT-PCR results. The limit of detection of these standard PDCoV RT-PCR assays was not defined in the papers (Song et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2014a) . Due to two steps of reaction set up, nested RT-PCR is more prone to contamination and special attention needs to be paid when performing nested RT-PCR. The standard RT-PCR assays especially the nested RT-PCR assays have not been widely used by (Chen et al., 2015b; Ma et al., 2015; Marthaler et al., 2014b; Zhang et al., 2016) . These rRT-PCR assays target the conserved regions of PDCoV M or N genes with the limit of detection (LOD) of 2 viral RNA copies per reaction for the assay described by Marthaler et al. (2014b) and LOD of 0.056 TCID 50 per reaction for the assay described by Chen et al. (2015b) 19 intestines, and 41 oral fluids) was comparable to that of singleplex PDCoV rRT-PCR and singleplex PEDV rRT-PCR . Some commercial multiplex rRT-PCR assays for simultaneous detection and differentiation of PDCoV, PEDV and TGEV have been developed (e.g. EZ-PED/TGE/PDCoV MPX 1.0, Tetracore Inc., Rockville, MD) and used by some veterinary diagnostic laboratories for routine diagnostic testing.\n\nfor PDCoV detection. In recent years, a point-of-need PCR detection platform integrating the insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR) technology and a field-deployable device (POCKIT TM Nucleic Acid Analyzer) has been developed for automatic detection and interpretation of PCR results within one hour (Tsai et al., 2012) . A PDCoV RT-iiPCR has recently been developed and validated for diagnostic testing . This PDCoV RT-iiPCR assay has a limit of detection of 9 RNA copies per reaction (Table 2 ) and has diagnostic performance comparable to PDCoV real-time RT-PCRs . The PDCoV RT-iiPCR is a potentially useful tool for on-site detection. \u2022 A variety of specimen types such as feces, rectal swabs, intestinal tissues or contents, oral fluid, environmental samples, feed and so on can be tested for presence of PDCoV RNA by rRT-PCR. Magnetic bead-based reagents and automated extraction on various magnetic particle processors such as Thermo KingFisher, Qiagen BioSprint, and Life Technologies MagMAX Express have been used in many laboratories for high throughput nucleic acid extraction. But nucleic acid extraction procedures need to be optimized based on specimen types. \u2022 Proper controls should be included in nucleic acid extraction and PCR reaction setup. For example, positive extraction control (a PDCoV-positive sample that undergoes nucleic acid extraction and PCR reaction), negative extraction control (phosphate buffered saline that undergoes nucleic acid extraction and PCR reaction), positive amplification control (PDCoV-positive RNA for PCR reaction), and negative amplification control (nuclease-free water for PCR reaction) are generally included. In addition, an internal positive control (IPC) such as Xeno TM RNA is recommended to be included. An IPC can be added to every reaction either at the nucleic acid extraction or at the PCR reaction setup step. The rRT-PCR master mix contains primers and probes for the IPC target, thus theoretically the IPC should amplify in every reaction. The absence of IPC amplification may indicate presence of PCR inhibitors in the sample. If both PDCoV and IPC fail to amplify in a sample, PDCoV PCR result is inconclusive and additional testing or resubmission of the sample is recommended. \u2022 When rRT-PCR assays reach their limit of detection, interpretation of PCR results could be a challenge. \u2022 rRT-PCR has many advantages such as rapid turnaround time between sample receipt and obtaining results, high sensitivity and high specificity, high throughput, multiplexing capability, and capability for genomic quantitation. However, PCR detects viral nucleic acid and does not distinguish live from dead virus in a sample.\n\nThe immunofluorescence staining is to detect viral antigen using virus-specific monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies that are either fluorophore-conjugated or unconjugated (if unconjugated, a fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody is needed); fluorescent staining of viral antigens is visualized under a fluorescent microscope. The immunofluorescence staining has been conducted on PDCoV-infected cell culture for confirmation of virus isolation (Chen et al., 2015b; Hu et al., 2015) , or performed on cryosections of tissues for determining the location of viral antigen in tissues .\n\nImmunohistochemistry is to detect viral antigen in formalinfixed paraffin-embedded tissues using virus-specific monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies followed by an enzyme-linked secondary antibody and chemical substrate; IHC can be visualized under a light microscope. PDCoV IHC has been described in some studies (Chen et al., 2015b; Ma et al., 2015) .\n\nFor PDCoV immunofluorescence staining and IHC, either M peptide-specific rabbit antiserum or polyclonal antiserum against PDCoV generated in pigs has been used in the published papers (Chen et al., 2015b; Hu et al., 2015; Jung et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2015) . Recently, PDCoV N protein-specific monoclonal antibody has been developed by South Dakota State University and made commercially available through the Medgene labs (Brookings, SD, http://medgenelabs.com) that can be used for PDCoV immunofluorescence staining and/or IHC.\n\nIn situ hybridization (ISH) is to detect viral nucleic acid present in fixed tissues using a labeled complementary DNA, RNA or modified nucleic acid strand (e.g. probe). Different than PCR approach where viral nucleic acid in a sample is amplified before detection, ISH detects viral nucleic acid that is not going through an amplifica-tion process. So far, only one published paper has described PDCoV detection using ISH approach .\n\nThe gross and histological evaluation of tissues is an important diagnostic method to correlate with ancillary tests such as PCR. However, the gross and microscopic lesions caused by PDCoV infection are not pathognomonic. Immunofluorescence staining, IHC and/or ISH along with hematoxylin and eosin examination can confirm lesions caused by PDCoV and also reveal locations of viral antigen/nucleic acid within lesions.\n\nObtaining a PDCoV isolate that can efficiently grow in cell culture is critical for pathogenesis study, development of diagnostic assays, and vaccine development. The National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) under USDA has isolated PDCoV USA/IL/2014 strain and Michigan/8977/2014 strain in swine testicular (ST, ATCC CRL-1746) cell line (Chen et al., 2015b; Ma et al., 2015) ; however, detailed isolation protocols have not been published. To present, only one published paper has described primary PDCoV isolation from clinical samples in cell cultures in detail . They reported successful isolation and propagation of PDCoV OH-FD22 strain in LLC-PK1 cell line (ATCC CCL-101) and ST cell line. PDCoV cytopathic effects (CPE) in LLC-PK1 and ST cells are similar and are characterized as enlarged, rounded, granular cells followed by cell detachment . It was found that PDCoV OH-FD22 replicated in LLC-PK1 cells in the absence of trypsin, but virus titer was about 10,000-fold lower than that with trypsin (5 log 10 PFU/ml vs 9 log 10 PFU/ml); also, no visible CPE was observed without trypsin . Addition of small intestinal contents (SIC) from Gn pigs together with trypsin (SIC + trypsin) or addition of pancreatin alone to the culture medium resulted in PDCoV titer of 7 log 10 PFU/ml which was about 100-fold lower than that with trypsin (9 log 10 PFU/ml) . Therefore, the optimized culture conditions for PDCoV OH-FD22 propagation in LLC-PK1 cells are advanced MEM (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 1% antibioticantimycotic (Gibo), 1% nonessential amino acids (Gibo), 1% HEPES (Gibo), and 10% trypsin (Gibco) . Interestingly, it was found that trypsin did not support PDCoV OH-FD22 propagation in ST cells; in contrast, PDCoV propagated efficiently in ST cells when 10% Gn pig SIC or 1% pancreatin was added . The optimized culture conditions for PDCoV OH-FD22 propagation in ST cells are advanced MEM supplemented with 1% antibioticantimycotic, 1% HEPES, and 1% pancreatin (Sigma, USA) . The mechanisms of beneficial effects of trypsin or pancreatin on PDCoV propagation in LLC-PK1 or ST cells remain unknown. However, it is noteworthy that the PDCoV USA/IL/2014 strain and Michigan/8977/2014 strain propagate well in ST cells grown in MEM containing 5 g/ml trypsin 250 (BD Biosciences) or DMEM containing 0.2 g/ml TPCK-trypsin (Invitrogen) (Chen et al., 2015b; Ma et al., 2015) .\n\nHu et al. attempted to isolate virus from 10 PDCoV PCR-positive clinical samples (4 fecal samples and 6 intestinal content samples) but virus was only successfully isolated from one intestinal content; VI from fecal samples was unsuccessful . In fact, the low success rate of PDCoV VI is similar to what has been observed for PEDV VI. In two studies Oka et al., 2014 Oka et al., 2014 , PEDV VI was successful in 2 out of 50 and 9 out of 88 PEDV PCR-positive samples, respectively; in addition, PEDV was only successfully isolated from intestinal homogenates or contents but not from fecal samples in those two studies. However, in a recent study, 3 PEDVs were successfully isolated in cell culture from feces (Chen et al., 2016a) . In another study, PEDV VI from 68 clinical samples was unsuccessful; but after one clinical sample (intestinal homogenate) was inoculated into pigs, PEDV was successfully isolated from fresh intestinal homogenates and cecum contents collected from the inoculated pigs (Chen et al., 2016b) .\n\nIt is speculated that high concentration of virus and immediate VI attempts on the fresh samples are the key to success of VI in cell culture. This approach can be considered for PDCoV VI as well when there is a difficulty to isolate PDCoV directly from clinical samples.\n\nDue to low success rate of PDCoV VI in cell culture, currently PDCoV VI is not a reliable assay to determine whether infectious virus is present in a clinical specimen or if 'X' treatment will inactivate the virus. For PEDV, swine bioassay has been commonly used to assess infectivity of PEDV present in various samples, including feed and feed ingredients after disinfectant or other treatments (Bowman et al., 2015b; Dee et al., 2014b; Dee et al., 2015) . Notably, some samples were PEDV VI negative after treatment but swine bioassay positive (Dee et al., 2015) , emphasizing the importance and necessity of performing swine bioassay to reliably determine virus infectivity of a sample. Based on some PEDV study, a neonatal pig bioassay is more sensitive than a weaned pig bioassay to assess PEDV infectivity and a 7-day duration would be appropriate for PEDV swine bioassay (Thomas et al., 2015) . There have not been reports on PDCoV swine bioassay, but experience and knowledge learned from PEDV studies could possibly be applied to PDCoV.\n\nThe first step of IFA assay is to prepare PDCoV-infected ST or LLC-PK1 cell plates and get plates fixed at the appropriate time points.\n\nThen serum samples to be tested are added to the plates to bind to the virus antigen followed by addition of fluorophore-conjugated anti-swine secondary antibody and visualization under a fluorescence microscope. IFA assay can be used for detection of PDCoV antibody in a qualitative manner (determination as positive or negative) or in a quantitative manner (determination of antibody titer). To determine PDCoV antibody titer, test serums are serially twofold diluted and incubated with PDCoV-infected cell plate(s); the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum that still gives positive fluorescent staining is considered as the antibody titers. Theoretically, IFA antibody isotype can be determined by using different types of secondary antibody; however, for most occasions, IFA assay is used to determine IgG antibody. IFA assay is not automated and is subjective with respect to result reading and reporting. Dynamics of PDCoV IFA antibody production and duration has not been well defined and correlations of PDCoV IFA antibody to other serological assays are unknown at this point.\n\nFor VN test, heat-inactivated serum samples are serially twofold diluted and incubated with a fixed amount of PDCoV (generally 100-200 TCID 50 ) at 37 \u2022 C for 1-2 h. Subsequently, the virus-serum mixture is added to ST or LLC-PK1 cells and incubated at 37 \u2022 C. The endpoint determination of neutralizing antibody can be based on viral CPE development (conventional VN test) or based on fluorescence staining (this format of VN test is also called fluorescent focus neutralization [FFN] assay). CPE-based VN test needs to wait until a viral CPE has fully developed in the virus control wells and generally takes 3-4 days. Sometimes serum cytotoxicity can be mistaken as viral CPE, making it difficult to interpret the results. For FFN assay, the cell plates inoculated with virus-serum mixture are generally incubated for 24-48 h and then stained with a FITC-conjugated monoclonal antibody against PDCoV N protein (Medgene labs). The reciprocal of the highest serum dilution resulting in >90% reduction of fluorescent staining as compared to the negative serum control is considered as the neutralizing antibody titer of the serum sample. For another closely-related swine enteric coronavirus, PEDV, virus neutralization assay in the FFN format has been frequently used (Okda et al., 2015; Thomas et al., 2015) . VN assays (both conventional CPE-based and FFN) are labor intensive, requiring manual reading and interpretation of the results. VN assays detect neutralizing antibodies but do not determine the antibody isotypes. So far, there have been no publications describing dynamics of PDCoV VN antibody production and duration. We have some preliminary data showing that PDCoV VN antibody was detected from 7 DPI through 42 DPI (the end of the study) in PDCoV-inoculated weaned pigs (unpublished). But correlations of PDCoV VN antibody to other serological assays have not been determined yet.\n\nVN or FFN assays detect functional antibodies with neutralizing activity. In addition to measuring neutralizing antibody levels in serum, FFN assay has been optimized to quantify PEDV neutralizing antibody levels in colostrum and milk to reflect lactogenic immunity (Clement et al., 2016; Okda et al., 2015) . Logistically, FFN assay can be adapted to measure PDCoV neutralizing antibody in colostrum and milk although no data is available yet in published literatures.\n\nSeveral indirect ELISAs have been developed for the detection of antibodies against PDCoV and these include a eukaryotic expressed PDCoV S1 protein-based ELISA (Thachil et al., 2015) , a prokaryotic expressed PDCoV N protein-based ELISA (Su et al., 2015) , and a PDCoV whole virus-based ELISA (Ma et al., 2016) . The PDCoV S1 protein-based ELISA was validated using 210 field serum samples and had a diagnostic sensitivity of 90.6% and a diagnostic specificity of 94.8% when the clinical exposure history and PDCoV PCR testing on fecal samples were used to reflect the true PDCoV serological status of those farms from which serum samples were collected (Thachil et al., 2015) . The PDCoV N protein-based ELISA was validated using 62 serum samples and had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 90.4% when compared to the Western blot results on the same 62 serum samples (Su et al., 2015) . The PDCoV whole virus-based ELISA was validated using a few immune sera generated from Gn pigs that were immunized intramuscularly twice with inactivated PDCoV; diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were not provided in the paper (Ma et al., 2016) . The optical density (OD) of ELISA is determined using ELISA plate reader and the sampleto-positive (S/P) ratios are calculated accordingly if S/P ratios are used to determine ELISA results. ELISA is considered a relatively objective assay. ELISA is a high throughput assay and is suitable for testing a large number of samples. In addition, ELISA can be used to measure antibody isotypes (e.g. IgG, IgA, and IgM) in various specimen types. For example, PEDV ELISAs have been used to detect IgG and/or IgA antibodies in serum, oral fluid, and feces samples (Bjustrom-Kraft et al., 2016; Gerber et al., 2014; Gerber and Opriessnig, 2015) . No publications have described dynamics of PDCoV antibody production and antibody duration as measured by PDCoV ELISAs.\n\nThe FMIA is a microsphere (bead)-based fluidic assay that has been increasingly used for serologic testing of animal infectious diseases (Christopher-Hennings et al., 2013; Langenhorst et al., 2012) . For the FMIA, up to 100 color-coded bead sets (fluorescent microspheres) can be used and each bead set can be conjugated to individual antigens for the detection of antibodies in biological samples. One apparent advantage of FMIA is that it allows simultaneous detection of antibodies to multiple pathogens present in a single sample. A FMIA based on PEDV N protein has recently been developed for the detection of PEDV antibody in serum samples (Okda et al., 2015) . The FMIA for the detection of PDCoV antibody has not been reported but it is expected that the FMIA technology can be successfully applied to detect PDCoV antibodies.\n\nIt is important to understand the antigenic relationships among porcine enteric coronaviruses (PDCoV, PEDV and TGEV) so that specific immunoassays for each virus can be developed. Ma et al. (2016) reported that the conserved or similar epitopes on N proteins of PEDV and PDCoV could cause two-way antigenic cross-reactivity of the two viruses. However, the pig PDCoV antisera did not crossneutralize PEDV and the pig PEDV antisera did not cross-neutralize PDCoV either (Ma et al., 2016) . In addition, the PDCoV IFA, S1 protein-based ELISA, and N protein-based ELISA assays specifically recognized antibodies against PDCoV and did not cross-react to antisera against PEDV or TGEV (Chen et al., 2015b; Ma et al., 2016; Su et al., 2015; Thachil et al., 2015) . Lin et al. (2015) reported that pig hyperimmune antisera against TGEV Miller strain cross-reacted with PEDV by cell culture immunofluorescence (CCIF) assay (similar to IFA assay described above) but pig antisera against PEDV did not cross-react with TGEV by CCIF assay; this one-way antigenic cross-reactivity by CCIF assay could be due to one epitope on the N-terminal region of PEDV/TGEV (Lin et al., 2015) . It must be emphasized that pig antisera against PEDV did not cross-neutralize TGEV (regardless of TGEV Purdue strain or Miller strain) and vice versa (Lin et al., 2015) . In addition, the PEDV whole virus-based ELISA and S1 protein-based ELISAs did not cross-react to pig antisera against PDCoV, PRCV, or TGEV Purdue strain in Chen et al. (2016b) study where pig antisera against TGEV Miller strain were not included. The PEDV N protein-based ELISAs also did not cross-react to pig antisera against TGEV and PRCV (Okda et al., 2015) .\n\nPDCoV has so far been detected in Hong Kong, the United States, Canada, South Korea, mainland China, and Thailand (Janetanakit et al., 2016; Lee and Lee, 2014; Li et al., 2014; Marthaler et al., 2014b; Song et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2014a; Woo et al., 2012) .\n\nIn a large-scale animal agent surveillance study conducted by a Hong Kong research group, a total of 7140 samples (tracheal swabs, rectal swabs, cloacal swabs, or nasopharyngeal aspirates, etc.) collected from multiple host species during a 53-month period (February 2007 to June 2011) were tested by a RT-PCR targeting conserved region of deltacoronavirus polymerase gene; among 169 pig samples, 17 pigs were positive (10.06% positive) and that was the first report of presence of deltacoronavirus in domestic pigs (Woo et al., 2012) .\n\nSeveral publications have reported detection of PDCoV RNA in domestic pigs in mainland China (Chen et al., 2015a; Dong et al., 2015; Song et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015) . Distribution and prevalence of PDCoV in China have not been determined nationwide but some local prevalence data have been reported. In one study, among 356 samples (170 fecal samples from sows or piglets less than 10 days old and 186 intestinal samples from piglets less than 10 days old) that were collected during November 2012 to March 2015 from diarrheic pigs on 51 farms in Jiangxi province, China and tested by PCRs, 120 (33.71%) samples were PDCoV positive, 231 (64.89%) were PEDV positive, 0 were positive for TGEV, and 70 (19.66%) were positive for both PDCoV and PEDV (co-infected); of the 120 PDCoV-positive samples, 70 (58.33%) were co-infected with PEDV (Song et al., 2015) . In another study, 215 intestinal or fecal samples collected during 2004-2014 from diarrheic piglets in four provinces (Anhui, Guangxi, Hubei and Jiangsu) of China were tested by PCRs; among them, 14 (6.51%) were PDCoV positive, 110 (51.2%) were PEDV positive, 5 (2.3%) were TGEV positive, and 2 (0.9%) were co-infected with PDCoV, PEDV and TGEV; of the 14 PDCoV-positive samples, 7 (50%) were co-infected with PEDV (Dong et al., 2015) . These studies suggest that PDCoV prevalence in Chinese swine is lower compared to PEDV infection and PDCoV co-infection with PEDV is common. Interestingly, one study also showed that PDCoV RNA was detected as early as in 2004 from diarrheic pig samples collected in Anhui province, China (Dong et al., 2015) . This is the earliest date that PDCoV RNA was detected in pigs worldwide.\n\nIn February 2014, the Ohio Department of Agriculture first announced the detection of PDCoV in U.S. swine after investigating the etiological agents for diarrheic sows and piglets on 5 Ohio farms (Wang et al., 2014a) . Subsequently, the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratories in Iowa and Minnesota reported detection of PDCoV in diarrheic pig samples collected from Iowa and Illinois Marthaler et al., 2014a) . PDCoV was also detected in 6 Ontario farms in Canada in mid-March 2014 (Marthaler et al., 2014b) . It remains unclear when PDCoV was introduced into the U.S., but a PCR-based retrospective testing of archived diagnostic samples at the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory revealed that PDCoV RNA could be detected as early as August 2013 in pig samples collected from Minnesota, Iowa and Illinois . A retrospective serological study using an indirect PDCoV S1 protein-based ELISA suggested the presence of PDCoV IgG antibody in 4 archived serum samples collected in 2010 from U.S. pigs (Thachil et al., 2015) .\n\nThe prevalence of PDCoV in U.S. swine was evaluated in two studies performed in the early stage of PDCoV emergence in the US. In one study, 293 porcine samples collected during January 6 to February 27, 2014 from 7 U.S. states (Ohio, Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska, Michigan, South Dakota, and Missouri) and Canada were tested by PCRs (Marthaler et al., 2014b) . Of 293 samples, 89 (30%) were PDCoV positive and were from Ohio, Illinois, Minnesota, and Nebraska. Of the 89 PDCoV-positive samples, 69 (78%) were coinfected with PEDV, porcine rotavirus A, porcine rotavirus B, or porcine rotavirus C; PDCoV and porcine rotavirus C co-infection was most common (52/89 [58%]) while PDCoV and PEDV coinfection was 29/89 [33%] (Marthaler et al., 2014b) . In another study, 435 samples collected during February 7 to April 9, 2014 from 10 U.S. states (Minnesota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Ohio) were tested by PCRs (Wang et al., 2014b) . Of 435 samples, 109 (25%) samples from 9 aforementioned states except Maryland were PDCoV positive; of the 109 PDCoV-positive samples, 19 (17%) were co-infected with PEDV (Wang et al., 2014b) . Now PDCoV has been present in U.S. swine for over two years since its emergence in February 2014, what is the current prevalence status of PDCoV in U.S. swine? The weekly-updated USDA Swine Enteric Coronavirus Disease (SECD) Situation Report (www.aphis.usda.gov/animal-health/secd), which compiles PDCoV and PEDV PCR testing results from 17 participating National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) laboratories, provides a more accurate and thorough description on swine enteric coronavirus status in U.S. swine. Some key points on PDCoV prevalence based on the report data up to the end of March 2016 are summarized below. . Co-infection of PDCoV with PEDV, TGEV, porcine rotavirus A, or Kobuvirus was not identified in that survey study .\n\nIn June 2015, acute diarrhea in piglets, gilts and sows on a swine farm was observed and testing 30 samples from the affected swine farm revealed that 26 samples were positive for PDCoV by RT-PCR; none of the 30 samples was positive for PEDV, TGEV, porcine rotavirus A, B, C, PRRSV, or circovirus (Janetanakit et al., 2016) . No other prevalence data of PDCoV in Thailand is available at this point.\n\nAs of the end of March 2016, there are 50 complete PDCoV genomes available in GenBank. These include 2 from Hong Kong, 7 from the mainland China, 1 from South Korea, 2 from Thailand, and 38 from the U.S. with collection dates ranging from May 24, 2004 to Jun 30, 2015 (Table 3) .\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of 50 PDCoV whole genome sequences indicated that 38 U.S. PDCoVs and 1 Korean PDCoV clustered together, PDCoVs from Hong Kong and mainland China clustered separately from U.S. and Korean PDCoVs, 2 Thailand PDCoVs formed another separate cluster (Fig. 4) . Phylogenetic trees based on PDCoV ORF1ab, S, M and N genes gave similar results to the tree based on Table 3 List of global PDCoVs with whole genome sequences available in GenBank through March 2016. Pairwise comparison of nucleotide identities of 50 global PDCoV is summarized in Table 4 . When all 50 sequences were compared, nucleotide identity data at the whole genome level and individual genes suggested that the S gene had more genetic diversity compared to other genes. The 50 sequences were further divided into 3 categories for pairwise comparisons: 9 Chinese isolates (including Hong Kong and mainland China), U.S. & Korean isolates (39 sequences), and 2 Thailand isolates. Among the U.S. & Korean PDCoVs, high nucleotide identity was observed (99.6-99.9% at the whole genome level and 99.5-99.9% for S gene), suggesting that the U.S. & Korean PDCoVs likely have the same origin; also, it appears that the U.S. PDCoVs have not undergone significant genetic changes during the periods October 14, 2013 to March 24, 2015 when these U.S. PDCoV samples were collected. Among 9 Chinese PDCoV isolates, nucleotide identities ranged from 98.6-99.5% and the genetic diversity among Chinese PDCoVs was higher than that observed among U.S. & Korean PDCoVs. The 2 Thailand PDCoVs were highly similar to each other but the Thailand PDCoVs were not very closely related to Chinese, U.S. or Korean PDCoVs.\n\nWhen 38 U.S. PDCoVs and 1 Korean PDCoV (KNU14-04) were compared, no deletions or insertions were identified among them. In contrast, Chinese and Thailand PDCoVs have shown some deletions or insertions (Table 3) . Specifically, when compared to the Chinese HKU15-44 and US & Korean PDCoVs, the Chinese strains HKU15-155, HN-2014, JS-2014, HB-2014, SXD1, and CHJXNI2 all had the same 3-nt (AAT) deletion in the S gene between nt 19473 and 19477, resulting in deletion of one deduced amino acid Asparagine (Asn or N). The 2 Thailand PDCoVs had a 6-nt (TTTGAA) deletion in ORF1a between nt 1738 and 1745 resulting in amino acid changes from SSLKI to SRI as well as a 9-nt (CCGGTTGGT) deletion in ORF1a between nt 2810 and 2820 resulting in amino acid changes from PEPVGKV to PDDV, when compared to Chinese HKU15-44 and U.S. & Korean PDCoVs. Interestingly, the Chinse Sichun-S27 PDCoV harbored both the 3-nt deletion in the S gene and the 6-nt & 9-nt deletions in the ORF1a. The biological significances of these deletions remain unknown. The evolutionary rates of PDCoVs are estimated to be 3.8 \u00d7 10 \u22124 substitutions/site/year at the whole genome level and 2.0 \u00d7 10 \u22123 substitutions/site/year for the spike gene (3483 nt) (Homwong et al., 2016) .\n\nAlthough the earliest detection of PDCoV was in 2004 in mainland China, it is difficult to decipher the evolutionary relationships of PDCoVs from different countries and to definitely infer the origin country of PDCoV at this point with limited sequence data. How- Fig. 4 . Phylogenetic analysis of 50 global PDCoV complete genome sequences. The tree was constructed using the distance-based neighbor-joining method of the software MEGA6.06. Bootstrap analysis was carried out on 1000 replicate data sets, and values are indicated adjacent to the branching points. The US, Korean, Chinese, and Thailand PDCoVs are indicated by black, red, blue and purple font color, respectively. ever, the currently available sequence data support the inference that PDCoV in South Korea was from U.S. although the routes of introducing PDCoV from U.S. to South Korea have not been identified. Not only for PDCoV, other infectious diseases such as PED have emerged or reemerged in multiple countries in recent years. Without knowing introduction routes of the pathogens between countries, it still remains a serious challenge to efficiently control spread of the emerging or reemerging diseases between countries or continents. How DCoV originated in or was transmitted to domestic pigs remains unclear. In 2007, Dong et al. (2007) reported a previously unrecognized coronavirus lineage detected from wild Asian leopard cats and Chinese ferret badgers from samples collected in southern China in 2006 . In 2009 , Woo et al. (2009b reported identification of three novel avian coronaviruses in wild birds (bulbul CoV HKU11, thrush CoV HKU12, and munia CoV HKU13). These three novel avian CoVs and CoVs identified from Asian leopard cats and Chinese ferret badgers all belong to the newly established Deltacoronavirus genus (Woo et al., 2010 (Woo et al., , 2012 . In 2012, identification of seven additional novel deltacoronaviruses in pigs and birds were reported (Woo et al., 2012) . Among deltacoronaviruses, PDCoV is most genetically similar to CoVs in Asian leopard cats based on available helicase, spike and nucleocapsid gene sequences (Woo et al., 2012) . It is unknown how DCoVs were transmitted between small mammals (such as Asian leopard cats and Chinese ferret badgers) and domestic pigs. A model of CoV evolution has been proposed in which bats are the gene source of Alphacoronavirus and Betacornoavirus whereas birds are the gene source of Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus (Woo et al., 2009a (Woo et al., , 2012 . It is likely that DCoVs are transmitted from wild birds to small mammals and/or domestic pigs. More surveillance and sequence data are needed in order to understand interspecies transmission of DCoVs between wild birds and small mammals, between wild birds and domestic pigs, and/or between small mammals and domestic pigs.\n\nRecent outbreaks of PDCoV in multiple countries have caused significant economic losses. Rapid diagnosis is critical for the implementation of efficient control strategies against PDCoV. Understanding PDCoV infection dynamics and collecting appropriate specimens at the appropriate time window are also important to obtain reliable diagnostic results. A number of virological and serological methods have been developed and used for PDCoV diagnostic testing. Among the virological methods, PDCoV-specific RT-PCR remains the method of choice for the detection of PDCoV; IHC combined with hematoxylin and eosin staining has also been commonly used to examine histopathological lesions caused by PDCoV; success rate of virus isolation in cell cultures has been low. Serological assays can provide information about previous exposure to PDCoV and also determine antibody responses to infection or vaccination when vaccine(s) are available. So far, kinetics of antibody responses to PDCoV infection and duration of PDCoV antibodies have not been studied in detail; correlations of various serological assays for the detection of PDCoV antibodies have not been established. PDCoV has been detected in several countries e.g. China, US, South Korea and Thailand. Prevalence of PDCoV in these countries is lower compared to that of PEDV. However, among PDCoV-positive samples, co-infection with other enteric pathogen e.g. PEDV is common. PDCoV RNA has been detected in samples collected in 2004 in mainland China. PDCoVs circulating in China have shown some different genetic characteristics as evidenced by phylogenetic and comparative sequence analyses. In contrast, PDCoVs detected in the U.S. and South Korea are genetically closely related and have not shown remarkable genetic changes. PDCoVs detected in Thailand are not very closely related to Chinese, US and Korean PDCoVs. The origin of PDCoV has not been clearly identi-fied. It remains to be determined whether global PDCoVs have the similar pathogenicity."}
