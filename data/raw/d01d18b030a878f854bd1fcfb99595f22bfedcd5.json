{"title": "Molecular cloning, expression, and puriWcation of SARS-CoV nsp13", "body": "In the spring of 2003, a severe epidemic disease broke out in China and quickly spread to more than 30 countries. It led to over 8000 infected cases and as many as 774 deaths [1] . This disease was designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the pathogen was identiWed as a novel coronavirus, named SARSassociated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2] [3] [4] . The SARS-CoV is a single-stranded plus-sense RNA virus with a genome of about 30 kb in length that has a 5\u0408 cap structure and a 3\u0408 polyadenylation tail. Upon infection of an appropriate host cell, the 5\u0408-most open-reading frame (ORF) of the viral genome is translated into a large polyprotein that is cleaved by proteases to release several nonstructural proteins (nsps), including nsp2 (3C-like proteinase), nsp9 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RdRp), nsp10 (NTPase/HEL), and so on [5, 6] . Among these nsps, the nsp13 protein has been predicted as an mRNA cap 1 methyltransferase by 3D jury system [7] .\n\nMethylated 5\u0408-terminal cap structures have been described in most eukaryotic and many viral mRNAs. The methylated cap structure is essential for eYcient initiation of translation and mRNA stability [8] . In all cap structures, including the \"minimal\" cap 0 (m7G(5\u0408) ppp(5\u0408)N), an N7methylguanosine (m7G) is attached through a 5\u0408-5\u0408 triphosphate bridge to the penultimate nucleoside. In some molecules, additional 2\u0408-O-ribose methylations are found at the penultimate and the antepenultimate nucleosides, forming the cap 1 (m7G(5\u0408)ppp(5\u0408)Nm) and cap 2 (m7G(5\u0408)ppp(5\u0408)NmpNm) structures, respectively [9, 10] . The enzyme that catalyzes the cap 1 structure is a (nucleoside-2\u0408-O-)-methyltransferase (2\u0408-O-MTase), which usually utilizes S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) as the methyl donor. The SARS-nsp13 protein belongs to the ancient family of AdoMet-dependent ribose 2\u0408-O-MTase. The enzymatic role of the protein was conWrmed by the presence of the conserved tetrad of residues K-D-K-E essential for mRNA cap 1 formation [7] .\n\nViruses adopt diVerent capping strategies based on their replication cycles and hosts, but most of them have the same cap structure as cellular mRNA. Viruses with cytoplamic replication cycle have to synthesize their 5\u0408terminal cap structures with their own methyltransferases. The order of methyl transfer reactions is variable, in some viruses the cap 0 structure is necessary for cap 1 methylation [10] , and in other viruses the cap 1 is a preferred substrate for the cap 0 MTase [11, 12] . So viral cap-forming enzymes (cap 0 and/or cap 1) are potential targets for antiviral drugs that would interfere with capping of pathogen mRNAs but spare the host capping enzymes. Exploring the structure and function of the SARS-CoV nsp13 protein will be extremely useful for the development of anti-SARS agents.\n\nIn this study, we cloned the nsp13 gene by RT-PCR from SARS-CoV PUMC02 strain genomic RNA, and constructed a recombinant expression vector pET30a(+)-nsp13. The His-tag-fused SARS-nsp13 protein was then expressed in Escherichia coli, puriWed through a single step aYnity chromatography, and Wnally identiWed by both western blot and mass spectrometry. A large quantity of the nsp13 protein can be obtained with this method.\n\nRestriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Berverly, MA). The expand reverse transcriptase and modiWed bovine trypsin (sequencing grade) were obtained from Roche (Mannheim, Germany). Pfu DNA polymerase and T4 DNA ligase were from Shanghai Sangon Co (Shanghai, China). Trizol reagent was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). The plasmid extraction kit and DNA agarose gel cleanup kit were obtained from BioDev (Beijing, China). Ni 2+ -NTA resin was purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Nitrocellulose membrane was purchased from Amersham Life Science (Newington, NH), and His-tag monoclonal antibody was from Novagen (Darmstadt, Germany).\n\nAll cloning techniques including PCR, restriction digestion, ligation, and E. coli transformation were performed as previously published [13] .\n\nSARS-CoV (PUMC02 strain) RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction. The reverse transcription was performed by the expand reverse transcriptase with the primer TTGTT AACAA GAATA TCACT TGAAA CCAC, which is proximately downstream of the nsp13 gene. The SARS nsp13 cDNA was subsequently ampliWed by PCR, using the following primers, nsp13 forward, 5\u0408-CGGGA TCCGC AAGTC AAGCG TGGCA AC-3\u0408, and nsp13 reverse 5\u0408-CCGCT CGAGT TAGTT GTTA A CAAGA ATATC AC-3\u0408, the sequences underlined are the recognition sites of the restriction enzymes BamHI and XhoI. After digestion with BamHI and XhoI, the PCR product was puriWed with gel cleanup kit and inserted between the BamHI and XhoI sites of the vector pET30a(+). The recombinant vector pET30a(+)-nsp13 was identiWed by restriction digestion and the SARS-nsp13 insert was veriWed by sequencing. E. coli DH5 was used for ampliWcation of the recombinant plasmid and E. coli BL21(DE3) was transformed for induced expression of the His-tagged SARS-nsp13 protein.\n\nA single colony of E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with the recombinant expression plasmid pET30a(+)-nsp13 was inoculated in a tube containing 2 ml of LB medium with 50 g/ml kanamycin, and cultured overnight at 37\u00b0C in a shaking incubator. The culture was transferred to a 1-L Xask containing 200 ml of the same medium. The Xask was shaken at 37\u00b0C until the OD 600 of the culture was about 0.6-0.8. The expression of SARS-nsp13 protein was induced by the addition of 0.5 mM of isopropyl -D-thiogalactoside (IPTG). After induction for 5 h at 25\u00b0C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000g, 4\u00b0C for 30 min. The supernatant was discarded and the cell pellet was washed, frozen, resuspended in PBS (pH 8.0), and then disrupted by sonication. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 12,000g, 4\u00b0C for 30 min. The supernatant was Wltered through a 0.45 m syringe Wlter. Ni 2+ chelating resin (200 l) was equilibrated with 5 ml of sterile deionized water, 2 ml of 50 mM NiSO 4 , and 5 ml of PBS. The supernatant was passed through the column, followed by washing the column with 5 ml of PBS and 5 ml of Wash BuVer (20 mM imidazole in PBS), respectively. The protein of interest was then eluted with 1-2 ml of elution buVer (200 mM imidazole in PBS). The eluted fractions were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE.\n\nThe protein sample was resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane using the Bio-Rad trans-blot apparatus. The membrane was incubated for 2 h at room temperature in BuVer I (5% skim milk, 0.02% Tween-20), His-tag monoclonal antibody was then added at a dilution of 1:1000, and the membrane was incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight. Three washes were followed by addition of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated horse anti-mouse IgG at a dilution of 1:1000 in BuVer II (5% skim milk, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-Cl, and pH 7.5), the membrane was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, the membrane was immerged into BuVer III (100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 100 mM Tris-Cl, pH 9.5) containing alkaline phosphatase substrate of 5-bromo-4chloro-3-indoxyl phosphate (BCIP) and nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT). The blot was allowed to develop and the reaction was stopped by washing the membrane in distilled water.\n\nExcised gel band of interest was in-gel digested with modiWed bovine trypsin [14] . Excess Coomassie brilliant blue stain was removed by washing twice with 1 ml of 100 mM NH 4 HCO 3 , 50% acetonitrile for 1 h at room temperature. Then clear gel pieces were vacuum dried completely using a SpeedVac concentrator (Savant). The dried gel pieces were re-hydrated by adding 10 l of digestion buVer (50 mM NH 4 HCO 3 ) containing 0.5 g of trypsin. After allowing 30 min for gel pieces to completely absorb the solution, an additional 200 l of digestion buVer without trypsin was added to fully immerse the gel pieces. Digestion continued for about 16 h at 37\u00b0C. The digestion buVer, now containing extracted peptides, was carefully removed and transferred into a clean microfuge tube. The gel pieces were re-extracted twice by adding 100 l of 0.1% TFA in 50% acetonitrile and incubating for 30 min at room temperature. The pooled extracts were vacuum concentrated to reduce the volume to less than 10 l. A volume of 0.5 l of matrix solution ( -cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid saturated in 50% v/v acetonitrile/0.5% v/v TFA) was mixed with the same volume of the extract, then applied onto stainless steel target. Mass spectra were recorded in positive ion reXection mode of a matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of Xight (MALDI-ToF) Voyager DE PRO (Applied Biosystems). Peptide masses obtained were searched against NCBInr database without any species limit using the Mascot search engine available online (www.matrixscience.com).\n\nThe SARS-nsp13 gene was ampliWed by RT-PCR (Fig. 1A) , the ampliWed product was about 900 bp, which was accordant to the theoretical length of nsp13 gene. The recombinant plasmid was digested by the restriction enzymes BamHI and XhoI. Agarose gel electrophoresis of the digest revealed a DNA band at about 900 bp (Fig. 1B) . The inserted fragment was veri-Wed by sequencing, the result was shown in Fig. 2 , which was identical to the published SARS-nsp13 gene sequence in NCBI and in the correct reading frame with the His-tag in the vector.\n\nEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) was transformed with the recombinant expression vector pET30a(+)-nsp13, and SARS-nsp13 protein was abundantly expressed after induction by IPTG . As shown in Fig. 3A , some of the target protein existed in the pellet. Lowering culture temperature and reducing the concentration of IPTG did not change the solubility (data is not shown here). The soluble fraction was loaded onto the Ni 2+ -NTA aYnity column, and the homogeneous protein was successfully puriWed with elution buVer after washing thoroughly. The puriWed protein was further analyzed with His-tag monoclonal antibody, and a speciWc blot band was detected at the corresponding position (Fig. 3B) . The predicted molecular mass of the SARS-nsp13 protein was 33.4 kDa, and there were 30 additional amino acids for the His-tag in the N-terminal of the expressed fusion protein. These extra amino acids increased molecular mass of the expressed target protein by about 3.3 kDa. Apparent molecular mass of the puriWed protein was about 37 kDa, which was expected. The yield from 200 ml of bacterial culture was about 1.3 mg of puriWed SARS-nsp13 protein after a single Ni 2+ aYnity chromatographic step. The recovery of SARS-nsp13 protein was about 26% (Table 1) . \n\nThe MALDI-ToF mass spectrum of tryptic digest of the gel band was shown in Fig. 4 . The achieved peptide masses were searched against NCBInr database without any species limit and with peptide mass tolerance of \u00a70.1 Da using the Mascot search engine. The Wrst candidate protein, with a score of 94, was SARS nsp16 protein (GI:30133975), a putative ribose 2\u0408-O-methyltransferase (the sequence was identical to that of the detected nsp13 protein here), and was the only one having a score greater than 75. The second candidate protein had a score of 67, which was lower than the signiWcant score of 75. Seven peptide fragments were matched with tryptic peptides of nsp13 protein, and the sequence coverage was 26%. The covered portions in nsp13 protein were underlined in Fig. 5 . The results above indubitably determined the identity of the recombinant His-tagged SARS-nsp13 protein.\n\nIn conclusion, we have succeeded in the molecular cloning of SARS-nsp13, and have transformed the Table 1 PuriWcation scheme of SARS-nsp13 protein expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) with pET30a(+)-nsp13 (200 ml culture)\n\nStep recombinant plasmid pET30a(+)-nsp13 into E. coli BL21(DE3). The puriWed His-tagged nsp13 protein has been identiWed by both western blot and MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry. The expression and puriWcation procedures in this study have provided a simple and eYcient method to obtain pure nsp13 protein of SARS-CoV in large quantities. The nsp13 protein obtained can be used for further study of its structure and function."}
