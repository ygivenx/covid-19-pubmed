{"title": "Synthesis and biological evaluation of 2-(5-substituted-1-((diethylamino)methyl)-2-oxoindolin-3-ylidene)-N-substituted-hydrazinecarbothioamides", "body": "Isatin has been known for about 150 years and has recently been found, like 2,3-dioxo-indoles and endogenous polyfunctional heterocyclic compounds, to exhibit biological activity in mammals (Somogyi, 2001). Schiff bases and Mannich bases of isatin are known to possess a wide range of pharmacological properties including antibacterial (Pandeya et al.,\n1998; Sarangapani and Reddy, 1994; Varma and Nobles, 1975), anticonvulsant (Sridhar et al.,\n2002; Varma et al.,\n2004), anti-HIV (Pandeya et al.,\n1998, 1999a, b, 2000; Sriram et al.,\n2000), antifungal (Pandeya et al.,\n1999a, b), antiviral (Singh et al.,\n1983), and anticancer activity (Fig. 1) (Karki et al.,\n2004, 2007, 2009). A variety of 3-substituted indolin-2-ones have been utilized as anticancer drugs or drug candidates (Mologni et al.,\n2010, Beauchard et al.,\n2009, Zhang and Go 2009, Andreani et al.,\n2010). A representative member of this class is sunitinib [SU11248, Sutent\u2122; Pfizer, Inc.] which is currently used in the clinics as a multi-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic activity (Fig. 1) (Sun et al.,\n2003). 6-Methoxycarbonyl group-substituted indolin-2-ones [BIBF1000, BIBF1120] are potent inhibitors of VEGFR-1/2/3, PDGFRa, and FGFR-1, with low cross-reactivity against a panel of other kinases (Fig. 1) (Roth et al.,\n2009). While BIBF1120 is currently being evaluated in phase III clinical trials in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer and is in clinical development for other tumor types. Indirubin was identified as the active ingredient of a traditional Chinese recipe [Danggui Longhui Wan] that was used for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) (Fig. 1) (Xiao et al.,\n2002).\n\n\nThiosemicarbazones of various aldehydes and ketones occupy a special place among organic ligands, since they contain various donor atoms and are able to change density depending on the starting reagents and their reaction conditions. Isatin-3-thiosemicarbazones (1H-indole-2,3-dioxo-3-thiosemicarbazones) have been studied extensively due to their important biological activities (Karki et al.,\n2009), since 1-methylisatin-3-thiosemicarbazone (Marboran) was found to be active in the treatment of smallpox. Previous studies by our group have revealed the promising cytotoxic, and anticonvulsant properties of various 2,3-dioxo-2,3-dihydroindole thiosemicarbazones (Fig. 1) (Karki et al.,\n2009). Therefore, we have performed the synthesis of new N-4-aryl thiosemicarbazone derivatives of substituted 2,3-dioxo-2,3-dihydroindoles and evaluated them for cytotoxic, antiviral, and antimicrobial activity.\n\nThe compounds in series 4 and 5 were prepared by the methodologies outlined in Scheme 1. The synthesis of 1-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1H-indole-2,3-dione derivatives (3) was carried out by mannich base reaction of 2,3-dioxy-2,3-dihydroindoles or 5-chloro-2,3-dioxy-2,3-dihydroindoles (2) with diethylamine in the presence of formaldehyde. The synthesis of N-diethylaminomethyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroindole hydrazinecarbothioamides (4a, b, 5a\u2013h) was carried out by reacting 1-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1H-indole-2,3-dione derivatives (3) with thiosemicarbazide and N\n4-aryl thiosemicarbazides under reflux in ethanol in the presence of catalytic amounts of glacial acetic acid. 1H-NMR spectroscopy indicated that the compounds exist as single isomers in solution.\n\n\nAll of the compounds were assayed for cytotoxicity against human HeLa and CEM T-lymphocytes as well as murine L1210 cells. These data are summarized in Table 1. Compound 5c was the most cytostatic among all compounds evaluated against the tumor cell lines (IC50 in the low micromolar range (1.9\u20134.4 \u03bcM)).\n\n\nThe most potent inhibitor of murine L1210 cell proliferation (5c) was also the most inhibitory to human T-lymphocyte (CEM) and HeLa cell proliferation. The introduction of R\n2-benzyl substitution in the thiosemicarbazone derivative of series 5 often led to more potent inhibitors of tumor cell proliferation (5a\u2013h). Replacement of the hydrogen by chlorine atom did not improve the potentiation of the cytostatic activity (compare 5a with 5b) (Table 1). Whereas, replacement of the chlorine atom at R\n2 by a methoxy group often resulted in a marked (equal) potentiation of cytostatic activity (5b with 5c).\n\nReplacement of hydrogen atom at R\n1 by chlorine atom did not yield any improvement in potency (compare 5a, 5b and 5d with 5e\u2013h). Replacing hydrogen atom at R\n1 and R\n2 by chlorine resulted in a complete loss of activity (5f). By keeping chlorine atom at R\n1 and CH3 and OCH3 at R\n2, resulted in slight improvement of cytostatic activity (5g and 5h).\n\nThe antiviral screening of 4a, b and 5a\u2013h was performed using an MTS-based CPE reduction assay (Kumar et al.,\n2010) against feline corona virus (FIPV) and feline herpes virus in CRFK cell culture; herpes simplex virus-1 (KOS) (HSV-1 KOS), herpes simplex virus-2 (G) (HSV-2G), vaccinia virus (VV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and herpes simplex virus-1 TK KOS ACVr (HSV-1 TK KOS ACVr) in HEL cell cultures; VSV, Coxsackie virus B4 (CV-B4), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in HeLa cell cultures; influenza A virus H1N1 subtype, influenza A virus H3N2 subtype, and influenza B virus in MDCK cell cultures; parainfluenza-3 virus (PI-3V), reovirus-1 (RV-1), Sindbis virus (SV), CV-B4, and Punta Toro virus (PTV) in Vero cell cultures.\n\nCompounds 4b, 5a, 5b, and 5d exhibited moderate antiviral activity in HEL cells in comparison to standard compounds. No specific antiviral effects were noted for any of the compounds in CRFK, MDCK, or Vero cell cultures (Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the synthesized compounds were screened for \u03b2-lactamase inhibitory activity and results are shown in Table 1. Compounds namely 5a and 5g were capable of inactivating \u03b2-lactamase activity, and for other compounds activity was moderate in comparing to standard potassium clavulanate. Titled compounds were also screened for antibacterial activity against S. aureus, B. subtilis, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, P. vulgaris, and S. typhi and antifungal activity against A. niger and C. albicans and exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity (Table 7).\n\n\nThe synthesis of the intermediate 2,3-dioxo-2,3-dihydroindoles was accomplished using a literature methodology (Marvel and Heirs, 1941) and a previously reported procedure was used to convert these compounds to the corresponding 1-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1H-indole-2,3-dione. The N\n4-arylthiosemicarbazides required for the preparation of 4a, b and 5a\u2013h was prepared by a literature methodology (Sen and Sengupta, 1962; Lieber et al.,\n1957).\n\n% Yield: 83, m.p.: 134\u2013136 \u00b0C; IR (KBr) (cm\u22121): 1131 (C=S), 1307 (C\u2013N), 1696 (C=O), 3005 (C\u2013H), 3143 (NH), 3238, 3256 (NH2); 1H-NMR (CDCl3) \u03b4 (ppm): 1.0 (t, 6H, 2CH3), 2.4 (q, 4H, 2CH2), 4.03 (s, 2H, N\u2013CH2), 7.0\u20137.7 (m, 4H, Ar\u2013H), 9.53 (s, 2H, NH2), 11.18 (s, 1H, NH); calc. for C14H19N5OS: C-55.06, H-6.27 and N-22.93, found C-55.18, H-6.15 and N-22.69.\n\n% Yield: 64, m.p.: 214\u2013216 \u00b0C; IR (KBr) (cm\u22121): 1127 (C=S), 1305 (C\u2013N), 1698 (C=O), 3008 (C\u2013H), 3136 (NH), 3227, 3246 (NH2); 1H-NMR (CDCl3) \u03b4 (ppm): 1.0 (t, 6H, 2CH3), 2.4 (q, 4H, 2CH2), 4.03 (s, 2H, N\u2013CH2), 7.0\u20137.7 (m, 3H, Ar\u2013H), 9.53 (s, 2H, NH2), 11.18 (s, 1H, NH); calc. for C14H18ClN5OS: C-49.48, H-5.34 and N-20.61, found C-49.34, H-5.21 and N-20.69.\n\n% Yield: 69, m.p.: 230\u2013232 \u00b0C; IR (KBr) (cm\u22121): 1127 (C=S), 1304 (C\u2013N), 1713 (C=O), 3008 (C\u2013H), 3143, 3217 (NH); 1H-NMR (CDCl3) \u03b4 (ppm): 1.0 (t, 6H, 2CH3), 2.4 (q, 4H, 2CH2), 4.03 (s, 2H, N\u2013CH2), 6.9\u20137.7 (m, 9H, Ar\u2013H), 11.29 (s, 1H, N\u2013NH), 11.52 (s, 1H, NH); calc. for C20H23N5OS: C-62.97, H-6.08 and N-18.36, found C-62.53, H-5.87 and N-18.15.\n\n% Yield: 74, m.p.: 151\u2013153 \u00b0C; IR (KBr) (cm\u22121): 1129 (C=S), 1317 (C\u2013N), 1716 (C=O), 3006 (C\u2013H), 3128, 3209 (NH); 1H-NMR (CDCl3) \u03b4 (ppm): 1.0 (t, 6H, 2CH3), 2.4 (q, 4H, 2CH2), 4.03 (s, 2H, N\u2013CH2), 6.4\u20137.7 (m, 8H, Ar\u2013H), 11.29 (s, 1H, N\u2013NH), 11.52 (s, 1H, NH); calc. for C20H22ClN5OS: C-57.75, H-5.33 and N-16.84, found C-57.39, H-5.26 and N-16.53.\n\n% Yield: 77, m.p.: 177\u2013179 \u00b0C; IR (KBr) (cm\u22121): 1119 (C=S), 1325 (C\u2013N), 1706 (C=O), 3008 (C\u2013H), 3120, 3202 (NH); 1H-NMR (CDCl3) \u03b4 (ppm): 1.0 (t, 6H, 2CH3), 2.4 (q, 4H, 2CH2), 3.75 (s, 3H, O\u2013CH3), 4.03 (s, 2H, N\u2013CH2), 6.3\u20137.7 (m, 8H, Ar\u2013H), 11.29 (s, 1H, N\u2013NH), 11.52 (s, 1H, NH); calc. for C21H25N5O2S: C-61.29, H-6.12 and N-17.02, found C-61.09, H-6.09 and N-16.80.\n\n% Yield: 67, m.p.: 191\u2013193 \u00b0C; IR (KBr) (cm\u22121): 1125 (C=S), 1297 (C\u2013N), 1706 (C=O), 3008 (C\u2013H), 3135, 3219 (NH); 1H-NMR (CDCl3) \u03b4 (ppm): 1.0 (t, 6H, 2CH3), 2.32 (s, 3H, CH3), 2.4 (q, 4H, 2CH2), 4.03 (s, 2H, N\u2013CH2), 6.3\u20137.7 (m, 9H, Ar\u2013H), 11.29 (s, 1H, N\u2013NH), 11.52 (s, 1H, NH); calc. for C21H25N5OS: C-63.77, H-6.37 and N-17.71, found C-63.42, H-6.14 and N-17.39.\n\n% Yield: 72, m.p.: 181\u2013183 \u00b0C; IR (KBr) (cm\u22121): 1125 (C=S), 1315 (C\u2013N), 1718 (C=O), 3008 (C\u2013H), 3123, 3219 (NH); 1H-NMR (CDCl3) \u03b4 (ppm): 1.0 (t, 6H, 2CH3), 2.4 (q, 4H, 2CH2), 4.03 (s, 2H, N\u2013CH2), 6.9\u20137.7 (m, 8H, Ar\u2013H), 11.29 (s, 1H, N\u2013NH), 11.52 (s, 1H, NH); calc. for C20H22ClN5OS: C-57.75, H-5.33 and N-16.84, found C-57.51, H-5.37 and N-16.27.\n\n% Yield: 79, m.p.: 219\u2013221 \u00b0C; IR (KBr) (cm\u22121): 1114 (C=S), 1310 (C\u2013N), 1713 (C=O), 3007 (C\u2013H), 3123, 3216 (NH); 1H-NMR (CDCl3) \u03b4 (ppm): 1.0 (t, 6H, 2CH3), 2.4 (q, 4H, 2CH2), 4.03 (s, 2H, N\u2013CH2), 6.4\u20137.6 (m, 8H, Ar\u2013H), 11.29 (s, 1H, N\u2013NH), 11.52 (s, 1H, NH); calc. for C20H21Cl2N5OS: C-53.34, H-4.70 and N-15.55, found C-53.29, H-4.54 and N-15.28.\n\n% Yield: 73, m.p.: 165\u2013167 \u00b0C; IR (KBr) (cm\u22121): 1123 (C=S), 1329 (C\u2013N), 1716 (C=O), 3008 (C\u2013H), 3127, 3224 (NH); 1H-NMR (CDCl3) \u03b4 (ppm): 1.0 (t, 6H, 2CH3), 2.4 (q, 4H, 2CH2), 3.75 (s, 3H, O\u2013CH3), 4.03 (s, 2H, N\u2013CH2), 6.3\u20137.7 (m, 7H, Ar\u2013H), 11.29 (s, 1H, N\u2013NH), 11.52 (s, 1H, NH); calc. for C21H24ClN5O2S: C-56.56, H-5.42 and N-15.70, found C-56.26, H-5.32 and N-15.47.\n\n% Yield: 72, m.p.: 178\u2013180 \u00b0C; IR (KBr) (cm\u22121): 1128 (C=S), 1309 (C\u2013N), 1711 (C=O), 3008 (C\u2013H), 3125, 3228 (NH); 1H-NMR (CDCl3) \u03b4 (ppm): 1.0 (t, 6H, 2CH3), 2.32 (s, 3H, CH3), 2.4 (q, 4H, 2CH2), 4.03 (s, 2H, N\u2013CH2), 6.3\u20137.7 (m, 8H, Ar\u2013H), 11.29 (s, 1H, N\u2013NH), 11.52 (s, 1H, NH); calc. for C21H24ClN5OS: C-58.66, H-5.63 and N-16.29, found C-58.43, H-5.38 and N-16.31.\n\nThe antiviral screening of 4a, b and 5a\u2013h was performed against FIPV and feline herpes virus in CRFK cell culture; HSV-1 KOS, HSV-2G, VV, VSV, and HSV-1 TK KOS ACVr in HEL cell cultures; VSV, CVB4, and RSV in HeLa cell cultures; PI-3V, RV-1, SV, CV-B4, and PTV in Vero cell cultures; influenza A virus H1N1 subtype, influenza A virus H3N2 subtype, and influenza B virus in MDCK cell cultures and the results are expressed as the 50 % effective concentration (EC50). Cells, grown to confluency in 96-well plates, were infected with 100 CCID50 of virus, one CCID50 being the 50 % cell culture infective dose. At the time of virus infection, serial dilutions of the compounds were added. The cultures were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 3 days, until complete CPE was observed in the infected and untreated virus control.\n\nThe cytotoxicity of the compounds was evaluated in parallel with their antiviral activity in uninfected cells, and is expressed as the minimum cytotoxic concentration to cause a microscopically detectable alteration of normal cell morphology (HEL, HeLa, CRFK, MDCK, and Vero cells).\n\nThe cytostatic effects of the test compounds on murine leukemia cells (L1210), human T-lymphocyte cells (CEM), and human cervix carcinoma cells (HeLa) were evaluated as follows: an appropriate number of cells suspended in growth medium were allowed to proliferate in 200-\u03bcl wells of 96-well-microtiter plates in the presence of variable amounts of test compounds at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified CO2-controlled atmosphere. After 48 h (L1210), 72 h (CEM), or 96 h (HeLa), the number of cells was counted in a Coulter counter. The IC50 value was defined as the compound concentration required to inhibit cell proliferation by 50 %.\n\nPenicillinase activity is expressed in Pollock and Torriani unit. One unit is the amount of enzyme which will hydrolyze 1 \u03bcM Sodium Penicillin G in 1 h at pH 7.0 at 30 \u00b0C.\n\nThe antimicrobial assays were performed for synthesized compounds by cup-plate method of all the synthesized compounds, as antibacterial activity against S. aureus, B. subtilis, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, P. vulgaris, and S. typhi and antifungal activity against A. niger and C. albicans. This activity was expressed in terms of diameters of zone of inhibition in mm.\n\nIn summary, a series of indolin-2-ones with N-diethyl amino and various thiosemicarbazide moiety were designed and synthesized. The cytotoxicity of all synthesized compounds was evaluated against two human cancer cell lines (CEM and HeLa) and murine leukemia cell line (L1210). Compound 5c displayed an excellent cytotoxicity against all three cell lines tested; in particular, it showed potent cytotoxicity against CEM and L1210 cancer cell lines. The preliminary structure\u2013activity relationship (SAR) studies revealed that combination of indolin-2-one core structure and 4-methoxy phenyl thiosemicarbazide moiety at the 3-position was more favorable. All the synthesized compounds were screened for cytotoxicity, \u03b2-lactamase inhibitory activity, antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal activity against various strains of microorganisms. Derivative 4b, 5a, 5b, and 5d showed antiviral activity against HEL cell cultures in the range of 11\u201320 \u03bcM, in comparison with IC50 values of 29, 10, >250, and >100 \u03bcM for standard brivudin, cidofovir, acyclovir, and ganciclovir, respectively. Mild to moderate antimicrobial activity was observed. The encouraging biological data provide an adequate rationale for further modification of these molecular scaffolds."}
