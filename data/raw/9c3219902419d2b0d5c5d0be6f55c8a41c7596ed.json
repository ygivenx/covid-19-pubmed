{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Potential effect of blood purification therapy in reducing cytokine storm as a late complication of severe COVID-19", "body": "We described three critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in Wuhan, China, featured with profound inflammation and treated with blood purification therapies, including plasma exchange and adso rption. Potential effect in managing cytokine storm and pathogenic antibodies was shown. This added to the limited therapeutic options in these patients, and more efforts are proposed to further prove the benefits.\n\nDuring the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, 5-6% of the patients need ICU admission or even mechanical ventilation due to severe respiratory failure, with the mortality increasing from 1.4% to over 60% (1, 2) . Non-survivors, with profound hypoxia and inflammatory response, are more likely to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (2, 3) . Additionally, reduced peripheral lymphocytes, high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6, and significantly abnormal coagulation parameters are hallmarks in those severe cases (4, 5) . Emerging evidence indicates the potential benefits of managing cytokine storm, via using steroid or IL-6/IL-6-receptor blocking antibodies (3, 6) . The capability of blood purification therapy in removing pathogenic antibodies or cytokines has been proven in multiple scenarios, but not in COVID-19 patients (7, 8) . "}
