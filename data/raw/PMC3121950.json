{"title": "The role of myeloid receptors on murine plasmacytoid dendritic cells in induction of type I interferon", "body": "Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), in contrast to conventional dendritic cells, are a rare leukocyte population which can rapidly secrete large amounts of type I IFN (IFN\u03b1/\u03b2) in response to viruses, including influenza virus, and some Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, e.g. CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) [1]. Although the original identification of pDC was complicated by their apparent lack of expression of surface markers associated with lymphoid and myeloid lineages e.g. CD19, CD3, CD11b, CD11c (in humans), CD13, CD33 and CD14 [2], pDC have subsequently been found to possess both lymphoid and myeloid characteristics. Murine pDC are CD11c+B220+CD11b\u2212Ly6C+ cells [1], and can also be defined using single mAbs, for example 120G8 [3] and anti-Siglec-H [4,5].\n\nInnate immune cells express many pattern recognition receptors (PRR) that allow sensing of foreign moieties, such as TLR, C-type lectins, scavenger receptors, retinoic acid inducible gene (RIG)-I-like and Nod-like receptors. Generally, these recognize microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMP) that are not present on host molecules, allowing discrimination between self and non-self. As viruses replicate in host cells they are composed of nucleic acids, lipids and glycoproteins derived from self molecules which makes the mechanisms of viral detection more subtle. pDCs detect viruses through TLR7 and TLR9 recognition of viral genomes (e.g. single stranded RNA and CpG containing DNA). However, viruses contain additional potential MAMP, such as glycoproteins, which may be distinguished from self through the virally encoded amino acid composition of the glycoproteins or host derived modifications. For example viral glycoproteins are presented in a repetitive array on the virus particle, the glycosylation may differ due to the cellular stress during viral infection and the properties of the glycoproteins themselves may lend themselves to different glycosylation patterns compared to host proteins. Several TLR, C-type lectins (e.g. mannose receptor, DC-SIGN, DC-SIGNR and SIGNR1), scavenger receptors and collectins bind to glycoproteins from a range of DNA and RNA viruses (reviewed in [6]). Therefore, we investigated whether the PRR on pDC were involved in viral particle and glycoprotein recognition leading to type I IFN production.\n\nImmune cells also express immuno-modulatory receptors. Several mechanisms dampen IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production, for example, deubiquitinating enzyme A (DUBA) is a negative regulator of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 downstream of multiple induction pathways [7]. CD200 and CD200 receptor (CD200R) are an immunomodulatory receptor\u2013ligand pair which negatively regulate a range of myeloid cell functions, including proinflammatory cytokine secretion in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation [8]. We therefore tested whether CD200 and CD200R affected different pathways of IFN\u03b1 induction.\n\nCells were isolated from the 129/SvEv mouse strain unless stated otherwise. In addition, cells were prepared from CD200 knock-out (KO) [9] and C57BL/6J strains. All animals were kept and handled in accordance with institutional guidelines.\n\nSingle cell suspensions of splenocytes and bone marrow-derived macrophages were isolated and prepared as described previously [10\u201312].\n\nSpleen cells or bone marrow-derived macrophages were stimulated in 96, 24 or 6 well tissue culture plates for 6\u201324 h with inactivated influenza virus, soluble glycoproteins or TLR agonists under the specific conditions indicated in each figure. Spleen cells were at 2.7 \u00d7 107 cells/ml and macrophages at 1 \u00d7 106 cells/ml unless otherwise stated. Where the IFN in samples was measured by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) or bioassay, supernatants were collected and stored at \u2212 20 \u00b0C before analysis. Where IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production was measured by intracellular staining, after 5 h 1 \u03bcl GolgiPlug (GE Healthcare, Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) was added per ml of media and the incubation continued. At the end of the stimulation cells were detached from the plate by scraping, washed three times in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 1% formaldehyde and stained with mAb to measure IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production by intracellular staining.\n\n\u03b2-propiolactone inactivated influenza virus (A/Guangdong/25/93) (H3N2), grown in embryonated hens' eggs and subsequently purified, was provided by M. Hocart. This virus is referred to here as inactivated influenza virus and was non infectious (< 100 plaque forming units/ml) by plaque assay (data not shown). Insect expressed glycoproteins were purified from the supernatant of baculovirus infected Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells. H5 haemagglutinin (HA) is from an H5N1 influenza virus (A/Vietnam/1194/04). H1 HA is from H1 influenza virus (A/New York/04). These were expressed with a human IgG1 Fc tag and purified as described previously [13]. The soluble outer domain (residues 251\u2013481) of gp120 from HIV-1CN54 was fused to a human IgG1 Fc tag. Alternatively, the gp120CN54 was fused to a human IgG1 Fc tag mutated at leucine 234 and leucine 235 to valine and alanine respectively to prevent Fc receptor binding and is referred to here as gp120CN54(VA) [14,15]. The spike protein from the Hong Kong isolate of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus was expressed with a tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag [16]. For depletion of Fc tagged proteins, 80 \u03bcl of GammaBind Plus Sepharose were washed three times in PBS, pelleted and resuspended in 200 \u03bcl volume of 10 \u03bcg/ml of H1 HA, H5 HA or gp120CN54 diluted in PBS. The GammaBind Plus Sepharose was incubated with the samples for 23 h, rotating at 4 \u00b0C and then pelleted by centrifugation. To assess the effectiveness of the depletion, these samples were separated on a 10% gel by SDS-PAGE and proteins were detected by silver staining using standard protocols. The beads were enriched for protein (data not shown), while the supernatants were depleted of protein (assessed by silver staining in Fig. 1E). As a control, the same volume and concentrations of proteins were incubated with PBS alone for 23 h. The \u201cdepleted\u201d supernatants or mock treated protein samples were used in subsequent experiments. The synthetic agonists polyI:C (GE healthcare) and CpG ODN 2216 (Invivogen, San Diego, California, USA) were also used in stimulations.\n\n2.7 \u00d7 107 spleen cells/ml (unless stated otherwise in figure legend) were pre-incubated in 0.75 ml RPMI with serum for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C without any additional factors, or with the following (at concentrations indicated in the figure legends, evidence for blocking function of antibody/compound referenced where relevant): F4/80 [17], anti-Dectin-1 (2A11) [18], anti-CD36 (MF3) [19], anti-CD200 (OX90), anti-CD200R (OX110), rat IgG1 (Serotec, Kidlington, Oxfordshire, UK), rat IgG2a (Serotec) or rat IgG2b (Serotec) mAb, maleylated-bovine serum albumin (BSA) (gift from C. Neyen, University of Oxford, UK), BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, Dorset, UK), fucoidan (Sigma-Aldrich) [20], laminarin (from Laminaria digitata) (Sigma-Aldrich), glucan phosphate (from Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (gift from D. Williams, East Tennessee State University, USA) [18,21] or mannan (from Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were then stimulated with media alone, 200 or 530 haemagglutinating units (HAU)/ml inactivated influenza virus, 1 \u03bcM CpG ODN 2216, 1.3 \u03bcg/ml H1 HA, or 0.13 \u03bcg/ml gp120CN54(VA), with the blocking reagent still present, as described in the relevant figure legends.\n\nCells were first fixed in 1% formaldehyde and then 0.2% saponin (Sigma-Aldrich) was included in all subsequent blocking, staining and wash steps. Following fixation, Fc receptors were blocked with FACS wash (0.5% BSA, (Sigma-Aldrich), 5 mM EDTA, 2 mM NaN3 in PBS) supplemented with 5% rabbit serum (Invitrogen) and 4 \u03bcg/ml 2.4G2 anti-CD32/CD16 mAb [22]. Spleen cells were stained with 120G8 [3], to identify pDC, and with mAb to measure IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2 production (clones 4EA1 and 7FD3 respectively [23]), as described elsewhere [12].\n\nData were acquired on the FACSCalibur system (Becton Dickenson, Oxford, UK) and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star Incorporated, Ashland, Oregon, USA). To calculate the percentage of IFN\u03b1+ or IFN\u03b2+ pDCs, debris was gated out by forward and side scatter characteristics and 120G8+ cells were selected by comparison to control staining. A gate was set where typically 5 or 10% of pDCs (120G8+ cells) fell within the IFN\u03b1+ or IFN\u03b2+ gates from a sample of spleen cells stimulated with media alone. This gate was applied to all other samples to measure the percentage of IFN\u03b1+ or IFN\u03b2+ pDCs following stimulation.\n\nThe IFN\u03b1 ELISA used is described elsewhere [12] Briefly, plates were coated with anti-IFN\u03b1 mAb (clone 4EA1) overnight and then samples were added for 2 h. IFN\u03b1 was detected with a rabbit polyclonal Ab against IFN\u03b1 and an alkaline phosphase conjugated secondary and absorbance at 405 nm was recorded. To estimate the amount of IFN\u03b1 in the samples, the mean absorbance for duplicate samples was compared to that from a standard curve of the IFN\u03b1A.\n\nThis assay measured IFN by the ability to inhibit Cocal virus induced cytopathic effect on L929 cells [24]. Monolayers of L929 cells in 96 well tissue culture plates were incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C with 2-fold serial dilutions of either IFN\u03b1A (from 250 U/ml) or samples in 100 \u03bcl serum free RPMI in duplicate wells. Subsequently cells were challenged with 250\u20132150 pfu/ml Cocal virus (gift from W. James, University of Oxford, UK) diluted in 100 \u03bcl serum free RPMI. As controls, cells were incubated without IFN in 100 \u03bcl serum free RPMI alone (cell control) or with Cocal virus only (virus control). After two days the point of 50% cytopathic effect was determined microscopically. The amount of IFN in the samples was estimated by comparison with the standard curve from the IFN\u03b1A.\n\nAs shown on each figure, n indicates the number of experiments using cells from different mice. Where 3 or more replicate experiments were conducted a 2-tailed t test or ANOVA with Bonferonni's multiple comparison test, paired when appropriate, was performed using GraphPad Prism 4.03 software. Means were considered significantly different when p < 0.05. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean.\n\nWe have recently shown that murine splenic pDC from 129/SvEv mice express a range of myeloid antigens, including the predominantly myeloid restricted receptors F4/80, CD36, Dectin-1, Dectin-2, mannose receptor and CD200R, and the broadly expressed CD200 [12]. Here, we investigated whether these receptors were involved in a key function of pDC, virally induced IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production. To investigate a role for a lectin in sensing influenza virus, we used mannan, a polymer of mannose, which blocks several lectins including Dectin-2, mannose receptor and SIGNR1. Treatment of spleen cells with mannan inhibited influenza virus stimulated IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2 production by pDC (Fig. 1A). The inhibitory effect of mannan on inactivated influenza virus-induced IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production by pDC was dose-dependent (Fig. 1B). In addition, treatment of spleen cells with mannan had little effect on cell viability (data not shown). Furthermore, mannan treatment reduced the production of functional IFN (measured by bioassay) by spleen cells following inactivated influenza virus stimulation (Fig. 1C). This led us to hypothesize that influenza virus may induce IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production through the direct recognition of mannosylated ligands on the influenza virus particle, for example envelope glycoproteins, through a lectin.\n\nIn support of the hypothesis, a range of purified insect expressed glycoproteins (H1 and H5 subtypes of influenza virus HA, HIV-1 gp120CN54 and SARS spike protein) were found to induce IFN production by splenocytes (Fig. 1D). The influenza virus HA and gp120CN54 used in Fig. 1D were Fc tagged, however the Fc tag was not required for IFN induction as gp120 bearing an Fc tag mutated in residues critical for Fc receptor binding (gp120CN54(VA)) (Fig. 1F) as well as glycoproteins lacking an Fc tag altogether such polyhistidine tagged gp120 (data not shown) and SARS spike (Fig. 1D) all induced IFN production by spleen cells. To confirm that the IFN induction was specifically due to the HA or gp120 glycoproteins, and not a potential contaminant within the samples, these Fc tagged proteins were depleted from the preparations by incubation with protein G coated sepharose beads (GammaBind Plus Sepharose). The mock PBS treated and GammaBind Plus Sepharose treated \u201cdepleted\u201d glycoprotein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and proteins visualized by silver staining to demonstrate the effectiveness of the depletion by the loss of a protein band at the expected molecular weight for the glycoproteins (Fig. 1E, inset). Depletion of the HA or gp120CN54 abrogated IFN induction (Fig. 1E). Samples were treated with polymyxin B to further confirm that the IFN induction by HA was not due to LPS. Polymyxin B treatment did not reduce IFN induction (data not shown). These data show that a range of soluble recombinant insect-expressed viral glycoproteins stimulated IFN production by spleen cells.\n\nTo investigate whether a lectin could be involved in the glycoprotein mediated IFN induction, spleen cells were treated with mannan before and during stimulation with the glycoproteins. Mannan also reduced IFN induction by H1 HA and gp120CN54(VA) (Fig. 1F). Trypan blue staining of spleen cells treated with mannan alone or together with the H1 HA and gp120CN54(VA) glycoproteins or inactivated influenza virus confirmed that mannan treatment did not affect cell viability (Supplementary Fig. 1 and data not shown). Dectin-2 is a lectin receptor expressed on pDC, which is mannan-inhibitable. Given the increasing understanding of its roles in signaling and DC activation [25], we investigated whether treatment of splenocytes with the anti-Dectin-2 blocking mAb 11E4 had any effect on inactivated influenza virus and CpG stimulated IFN\u03b1 production. However we observed that 11E4 treatment had no effect on IFN\u03b1 secretion (data not shown). In summary, these data suggest the involvement of a lectin in viral glycoprotein sensing, leading to IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production.\n\nTo assess the role of Dectin-1 in IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production by pDC, spleen cells were treated with the blocking mAb 2A11 [18] before and during stimulation with inactivated influenza virus. Treatment with this anti-Dectin-1 mAb had no significant effect on inactivated influenza virus stimulated IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b2 production by pDC compared to treatment with an isotype control mAb or no mAb (Fig. 2A). In addition, blocking with the Dectin-1 ligands laminarin or glucan phosphate did not affect IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production by pDC following inactivated influenza virus stimulation (Fig. 2B and C). These results suggest that Dectin-1 is not required for inactivated influenza virus stimulated IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production by pDC.\n\npDC express functional scavenger receptor(s) including CD36 [12,26,27], therefore we tested whether a mAb against CD36 or more general scavenger receptor ligands affected inactivated influenza virus induced IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production by pDC. Spleen cells were treated with the MF3 mAb against CD36, which has been recently found to inhibit macrophage fusion by blocking CD36 [19], before and during stimulation with inactivated influenza virus. Treatment with this anti-CD36 mAb did not significantly affect IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b2 production by influenza virus stimulated pDC compared to untreated cells (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, incubation with fucoidan or maleylated BSA, which block CD36 and other scavenger receptors, did not significantly alter IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b2 production by pDC compared to controls (Fig. 3B). Therefore, although pDC express CD36 we found no evidence that CD36, nor scavenger receptors more generally, have a role in inactivated influenza virus induced IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production by pDC.\n\nAs several antibodies against highly expressed antigens on pDC alter IFN\u03b1 production [4,28] and pDC clearly express F4/80 [12], we tested whether treatment of spleen cells with the mAb F4/80 affected influenza virus stimulated IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production by pDC. The F4/80 mAb has been shown to block IFN\u03b3 release from NK cells [17], however treatment of spleen cells with F4/80 did not alter IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b2 production by pDC (Fig. 4). Therefore, despite clear expression on pDC, no evidence was found that F4/80 plays a role in influenza virus induced IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production by pDC.\n\nAs pDC and other splenocytes express both CD200 and CD200R [12], we tested whether this immunomodulatory receptor\u2013ligand pair affected IFN\u03b1 production. CD200 is known to have inhibitory effects on myeloid cells, and consistent with this we found that CD200 KO macrophages produced more IFN\u03b1 than the C57BL/6J control macrophages following polyI:C stimulation (Fig. 5A). To test the effect of CD200 on pDC function, spleen cells were incubated with the OX90 mAb against CD200, which blocks CD200 interaction with CD200R (unpublished observation, N. Barclay), or an isotype control mAb or no Ab and then stimulated with either of the MyD88-dependent stimuli CpG ODN or inactivated influenza virus. OX90 treatment significantly inhibited IFN\u03b1 production by spleen cells at 23 h in response to CpG ODN stimulation (Fig. 5B). The same level of blocking was observed with OX90 concentrations as low as 10 \u03bcg/ml (data not shown). In addition, OX90 also slightly reduced IFN\u03b1 production by spleen cells in response to inactivated influenza virus, however, the effect was not significant by paired ANOVA (Fig. 5C). Intriguingly, OX90 did not affect IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production by pDC following 9 or 12 h stimulation with CpG ODN (data not shown), suggesting the effects of OX90 develop over time. OX90 was not toxic as treatment of spleen cells for 23 h with 10 or 100 \u03bcg/ml OX90 or an isotype control mAb, in the presence or absence of CpG ODN, had no effect on the percentage of dead cells (data not shown). As a further control, a non-blocking mAb against CD200R OX110, was tested. This mAb, binds to CD200R, but does not disrupt its interaction with CD200 (unpublished observation, N. Barclay). OX110 had no effect on IFN\u03b1 production in response to influenza virus or CpG ODN, compared to the isotype control mAb (Fig. 5D), showing that a blocking Ab against the CD200-CD200R interaction is required to inhibit the response. IFN production by CpG ODN or inactivated influenza virus stimulated C57BL/6J or CD200 KO splenocytes was also measured by bioassay, however due to a large variation in the levels of IFN produced, this assay was not powerful enough to enable meaningful interpretation. These data suggest that CD200 promotes MyD88-dependent IFN\u03b1 production, in contrast to the known inhibitory effect of CD200 on myeloid cells and the observation that CD200 deficient macrophages produced higher levels of IFN\u03b1 in response to a MyD88-independent stimulus.\n\nIn this study we tested whether several myeloid receptors found on pDC have a functional role in viral recognition leading to IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production. Although pDC expressed low levels of Dectin-1, no evidence was found for a Dectin-1 function in induction of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 in response to inactivated influenza virus. However, mannan, which blocks receptors recognizing mannosylated ligands including the mannose receptor, SIGNR1 and Dectin-2, inhibited IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production by pDC following influenza virus stimulation, suggesting a function for such lectins in viral recognition. Studies designed to identify a function for a specific mannose binding receptor, utilizing mannose receptor KO spleen cells or the blocking anti-SIGNR1 mAb ERTR9, were inconclusive (data not shown) due to large ranges in IFN production from C57BL/6J splenocytes and highly variable affects of ERTR9. Others have shown that several monosaccharides, mannan and anti-mannose receptor antiserum reduced IFN\u03b1 production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to herpes simplex virus-1 [29]. Furthermore, mannan inhibited influenza virus stimulated IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production by spleen cells [30]. Together these studies implicate a mannose specific receptor and mannose receptor in particular as being involved in IFN\u03b1 induction in response to several viruses either as an uptake receptor or a signaling pattern recognition receptor.\n\nAs mannan blocks receptors which recognize certain mannose-containing carbohydrates, we hypothesized that viral glycoproteins were the stimulus for the mannan inhibitable component of IFN induction. We found that highly mannosylated viral glycoproteins produced in insect cells could stimulate IFN production by spleen cells in a mannan-inhibited manner, suggesting a lectin could recognize glycosylation of the viral proteins. Further evidence for viral glycoproteins inducing IFN production is reviewed in [6]. Whether this ability to induce interferon is a property of the viral glycoprotein per se, or a result of protein expression in insect cells is currently unclear. However, recognition of glycans synthesized in insect cells is also relevant for the understanding of immune responses to insect vector-borne viruses and vaccines which use recombinant proteins expressed in insect cells.\n\nDespite CD36 being highly expressed on pDCs we found no evidence, through use of a blocking anti-CD36 mAb or scavenger receptor ligands, that CD36 or another scavenger receptor was involved in influenza virus induced IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production by pDC. It may be interesting in future to test the requirement of CD36 in CpG induced IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production by pDC as some scavenger receptors, which are endocytic, can enable the uptake of CpG ODN which signals through TLR9 in the endosomes of pDC to induce IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production [31].\n\npDC also express F4/80 however the F4/80 mAb had no effect on inactivated influenza virus induced IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production by pDC. Because many antibodies against highly expressed antigens on pDC have subsequently been found to modulate IFN\u03b1 production by these cells [4,28], F4/80 may be a useful tool to isolate or study pDC without interfering with pDC function.\n\nPrevious work has shown that pDC expressed clearly detectable CD200 and CD200R [12]. CD200 and CD200R are an immunomodulatory receptor\u2013ligand pair which inhibit a range of myeloid cell functions including cytokine secretion by macrophages. MyD88-dependent TLRs recognize viruses and induce IFN in pDC, but IFN production in macrophages is dependent primarily on a TRIF-dependent pathway (TLR-3). Because these two cell types use either MyD88- or TRIF-dependent IFN production we compared them to investigate the influence of CD200 on both MyD88 and TRIF mediated signaling pathways. CD200 KO macrophages produced more IFN\u03b1 than the C57BL/6J macrophages, consistent with an inhibitory effect of CD200 in these cells. Intriguingly, the OX90 blocking mAb against CD200, significantly inhibited CpG ODN (TLR9- and MyD88-dependent) IFN\u03b1 production by splenocytes and reduced inactivated influenza virus (TLR7- and MyD88-dependent) induced IFN\u03b1, suggesting that CD200 normally enhances IFN\u03b1 production via MyD88-dependent pathways in these cells. It has been reported that treatment of pDC with soluble CD200 can either induce IFN\u03b1 production or enhance CpG induced IFN\u03b1 production [32,33], supporting the hypothesis that CD200 has positive regulatory functions. The effects of CD200 on pDC are likely to be through its receptor CD200R as CD200 itself has no known signaling capacity. It has been suggested that CD200 may also engage CD200R-like molecules [34], however in extensive studies by Wright et al. and Hatherley et al. no evidence was found that CD200 could interact with CD200R2, CD200R3, CD200R4 or CD200RLe [35,36]. Intriguingly, there are several viral homologues of CD200 which, in the limited assays tested so far, behave similarly to the endogenous CD200. The fact that several viruses possess CD200 homologues suggests that this molecule is important in the virus lifecycle and may play a role in anti-viral immunity.\n\nIn summary, we present evidence that CD200 may differentially regulate IFN\u03b1 induction pathways and have both negative and positive regulatory functions. Our results suggest that CD200 inhibits MyD88-idependent IFN\u03b1 induction in macrophages, while in contrast, CD200 is a positive regulator of TLR9 (CpG ODN) and possibly of TLR7 (inactivated influenza) MyD88-dependent IFN\u03b1 inducing pathways."}
