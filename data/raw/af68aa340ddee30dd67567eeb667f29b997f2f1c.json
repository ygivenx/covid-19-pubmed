{"title": "Development and external validation of a prognostic multivariable model on admission for hospitalized patients with COVID-19", "body": "Background: COVID-19 pandemic has developed rapidly and the ability to stratify the most vulnerable patients is vital. However, routinely used severity scoring systems are often low on diagnosis, even in non-survivors. Therefore, clinical prediction models for mortality are urgently required.\n\nWe developed and internally validated a multivariable logistic regression model to predict inpatient mortality in COVID-19 positive patients using data collected retrospectively from Tongji Hospital, Wuhan (299 patients). External validation was conducted using a retrospective cohort from Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan (145 patients). Nine variables commonly measured in these acute settings were considered for model development, including age, biomarkers and comorbidities. Backwards stepwise selection and bootstrap resampling were used for model development and internal validation. We assessed discrimination via the C statistic, and calibration using calibration-in-the-large, calibration slopes and plots. 4 demonstrated that the model is able to make reliable predictions in patients from different hospitals. In addition, these variables agree with pathological mechanisms and the model is easy to use in all types of clinical settings.\n\nAfter further external validation in different countries the model will enable better risk stratification and more targeted management of patients with COVID-19. With the nomogram, this model that is based on readily available parameters can help clinicians to stratify COVID-19 patients on diagnosis to use limited healthcare resources effectively and improve patient outcome.\n\nSince the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 in December 2019 in China, there have been over 200,000 confirmed cases, with 10-20% developing severe COVID-19 and approximately 5% requiring intensive care 1, 2 . Although the number of daily cases has significantly reduced in China because of intensive control procedures, the numbers in the rest of world are continuing to increase. More than 10,000 deaths have been reported but the estimated mortality rate (3%) is much lower than Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are not life-threatening, stratification of these patients becomes increasingly important as large populations are expected to be infected globally.\n\nThe deaths and morbidity from COVID-19 infection are primarily due to respiratory failure, although a few people have died of multiple organ failure (MOF) or chronic comorbidities 4,5 .\n\nTherefore, reduced oxygen saturation is the major indicator of disease severity. However, symptoms at onset are relatively mild and a substantial proportion of patients have no obvious symptoms prior to the development of respiratory failure 4, 5 . Clinically, it is difficult to stratify patients who may develop lethal COVID-19 until respiratory failure develops. Since early identification and effective treatment can reduce mortality and morbidity as well as relieve resource shortages, there is an urgent need for effective prediction models to identify patients who are most likely to develop respiratory failure and poor outcomes.\n\nA robust, highly discriminatory and validated clinical prognosis model is required for stratification of these patients. Currently, very few reports propose reliable prediction models, which have been constructed using Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) guidance with internal and external validation 6 . One report based on a cohort of 191 COVID patients in early stages of the pandemic showed that age, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and D-dimer are independent risk factors of mortality 7 . However, D-dimer is not a routinely available clinical measurement and SOFA can be relatively low in COVID-19 patients on admission, but in the aforementioned report some patients in late stage of COVID-19 were transferred to its study hospitals 7 . This might explain the difference in SOFA scores.\n\nIn this study, we aimed to employ routine, widely available clinical test data to predict mortality of COVID-19 hospitalised patients using multivariable regression analysis in a cohort of 299 cases. The model has been established and validated with a new cohort of 145 patients with COVID-19 from a different hospital. Through this study, we hope that the experience from the outbreak in China will assist the rest of the world in better stratification of COVID-19 patients to achieve better outcomes for patients.\n\nThis was a retrospective observational study performed in officially designated treatment centers for confirmed patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan at the center of the outbreak in China.\n\nThe protocol was approved by the local Institutional Ethics Committee (Approval Number: KY-2020-10.02). First cohort of 299 patients admitted in Tongji hospital within January and February 2020 were enrolled into this study for model development. Second cohort of 151 patients admitted to Jinyintan hospital who were included in a previous study were reused for model validation. All patients were diagnosed by positive tests of novel coronavirus nucleic acids (SARS-CoV-2), according to WHO interim guidance 8 . Only patients who were discharged from hospital or had died were included in this study. Six patients in the second cohort, who died very quickly after admission and did not received any laboratory testing, were excluded. Patients younger than 18 years of age were also excluded.\n\n.

The time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission was also recorded. SOFA was calculated within 24h of admission. For patients who did not have arterial blood gas analysis, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) to estimate the arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) and the recorded fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) were used. The SOFA score for the respiratory system was calculated according to PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio when patients received non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation. All patients were closely followed until they died or were discharged from the hospital. Hospital mortality and length of hospital stay were also recorded.\n\nData were fully anonymized before data cleaning and analyses. We followed the TRIPOD guidance for development, validation and reporting of multivariable prediction models 6 .\n\nAnalyses were performed in R version 3.5.1 9 . The development model was built using the data from Tongji Hospital. We performed logistic regression analysis with the outcome variable defined as mortality. Variables were selected a priori based on previous clinically-related studies, completeness across both sites, clinical knowledge and practicality of measurement in acute medical emergencies. Variables were excluded if they had high collinearity with global scores. The number of predictors was restricted based on the total number of outcomes in the development dataset 10 . Analysis was conducted for the following nine variables: age, hypertension, diabetes, SpO2, systolic blood pressure, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte count and platelet count. Organ-specific markers, such as alanine transaminase (ALT) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were not included in the original development model because of collinearity with global markers, particularly LDH. SOFA score was not included for this reason, as explained in Results. D-dimer, interleukin (IL)-6 and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) were excluded from the analysis because they were not routinely tested in the cohorts. LDH .

Albumin was selected as a marker for the acute phase response instead of C reactive protein (CRP) because of CRP collinearity with LDH. Age is known risk factor for mortality from severe respiratory infections, including COVID-19. Lymphocyte count and platelet counts were reported in a previous publication of COVID-19 and selected 7, 12 . In this study, lymphocyte count was log transformed due to extreme values. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diabetes and hypertension were selected based on previous publications 7 . All nine selected variables were input into the multivariable model and backwards stepwise selection was performed with improvement in goodness-of-fit assessed by a reduction in the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). A nomogram of the selected final model was used for graphical representation of the prediction model and was produced with R function regplotthis was chosen to offer maximum use of the prediction model in clinical practice without the need for internet access 13, 14 .\n\nModel performance was assessed via measures of discrimination and calibration. To assess discrimination, the C statistic was used. For calibration, patients in the development database were split into deciles, ordered by their probability of death. For each decile, the mean of the predicted probability of death was calculated and compared with the mean observed probability of death. Calibration plots were constructed including locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (loess) regression lines 15 .\n\nInternal validity was assessed with bootstrapping (1000 replications) of the entire model building process including backwards stepwise selection of all potential predictors. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 28.20045997 doi: medRxiv preprint calculation of optimism and optimism adjusted discrimination and calibration statistics. The final development model coefficients were then adjusted for optimism using the optimism adjusted calibration slope for shrinkage 15 .\n\nTo assess external validity, the final optimism-adjusted model was applied to an independent data set, from Jinyintan hospital. External validity of the model was assessed using the C statistic, calibration-in-the-large, calibration slope and the calibration plot. Recalibration was conducted updating the intercept, and the intercept and slope.\n\nThe development cohort included 299 patients who were admitted in Tongji Hospital. Data completeness is presented in supplementary Table 1 . There were 155 deaths, the median age of patients was 65 years (IQR: 54-73) and 48\u00b72% were male ( Table 1 ). The validation cohort that included 145 patients was younger: age 56 years (IQR 47-68) with a higher percentage of males (65\u00b75%) than in the developmental cohort (P<0\u00b7001). The median (IQR) time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission was no different in the developmental 10 [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] and validation 10 [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] cohorts. More patients had hypertension (42\u00b76% vs 26\u00b79%) and heart failure (4\u00b74% vs 0.7%) in the development than validation cohorts, whilst diabetes (18\u00b75% vs 11\u00b77%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (5\u00b70% vs 3\u00b74%) and others (6\u00b74% vs 4\u00b78) showed no statistical difference. SOFA scores were statistically higher in the development than validation cohorts (2\u00b70 [2\u00b70-4\u00b70] vs 1\u00b70 [0\u00b70-3\u00b70]) but both were very low compared to common critical illnesses. Table 2 shows that non-survivors were significantly older than survivors (69 years (IQR 61\u00b775 to 75\u00b700) vs. 52\u00b750 (IQR 43\u00b775-64\u00b700), p<0\u00b7001). Patients with hypertension, showed a significantly higher mortality rate (p<0\u00b7001).\n\n.

The final multivariable model included age (adjusted OR 1\u00b7054; 95% CI 1\u00b7028 to 1\u00b7083), LDH (adjusted OR 1\u00b7004; 95% CI 1\u00b7002 to 1\u00b7006), log lymphocyte count (adjusted OR 0\u00b7296; 95% CI 0\u00b7148 to 0\u00b7541) and SpO2 (adjusted OR 0\u00b7897; 95% CI 0\u00b7831 to 0\u00b7958) ( Table 3 ). The final model showed excellent discrimination (C statistic = 0\u00b789) and was well calibrated (slope =1 and calibration-in-the-large =0\u00b700), as shown in the calibration plot (Table   4 and Figure 1 ). The final model for mortality is presented as a nomogram and an example of how to use the nomogram is presented for a patient aged 59, with LDH of 482, SpO2 of 85% and lymphocyte count of 0\u00b764 ( Figure 2 ).\n\nInterval validation was run using bootstrap resampling and showed a small amount of overfitting. Bootstrapping with backwards stepwise selection provided a shrinkage factor of 0.900. After adjusting for overfitting the final model retained high discrimination (C statistic= 0\u00b7880) and calibration-in-the-large of 0\u00b7006 (Table 4 ). The shrinkage factor was applied to the \u03b2 coefficients of the multivariable model to provide optimism adjusted coefficients (Table 3) .\n\nExternal validation is required because the accuracy of a predictive model will always be high if it is validated on the development cohort used to generate the model 16, 17 . In this study, we applied our final prediction model with optimism adjusted coefficients to the validation dataset.\n\nThere were 145 patients in the validation dataset of whom 69 patients (47\u00b76%) died. Of the 145 patients, 127 had complete data for the four variables in the final developmental model (age, lymphocyte count, SpO2 and LDH) The C statistic for the discrimination of the developed model in the independent data was 0\u00b7980 (0\u00b7958 to 1\u00b7000) and the model had reasonable calibration (slope and calibration-in-the-large) ( Table 5 ). Figure 3 suggests some miscalibration of the model in the independent data with over-estimation of risk of mortality in .

After recalibration of the intercept, the discrimination of the model was the same (as expected given that recalibration does not influence the ranking of individuals according to the model) as was the calibration slope. Calibration-in-the-large was 0\u00b700 (-0\u00b7477 to 0\u00b7471). The calibration plots still suggest mis-calibration of the model (Figure 3c ). When both intercept and slope were recalibrated the calibration slope was 1\u00b700 (0\u00b7675 to 1\u00b7477) and the plot then demonstrated good calibration (Figure 3d ).\n\nMost routine scoring systems, such as SOFA, which are very useful in the intensive care unit is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 28.20045997 doi: medRxiv preprint of the final model after optimization can be used by clinicians to give a prediction of mortality and thus inform treatment choice and guide patient and family counselling.\n\nOld age is a major factor of mortality from infection 21 . This is consistent with the current data from China on COVID-19 with less than 1% in children <10 years old, increasing to 2%, 4% and 10% in age 11-40, 41-70, and >70, respectively. However, the majority of people infected are 30-70 years old (approximately 80% of the total cases), thereby making it difficult to stratify the majority of cases according to age. Patient comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, did not significantly contribute to the model, although mortality rates were significantly higher in patients with hypertension.\n\nThe pathological feature of COVID-19 is mainly that of a viral pneumonia with alveolar oedema and blockage of small bronchi to compromise gas exchange within the lungs.\n\nTherefore, PaO2 will drop when severe pneumonia develops. Since arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis is an invasive and complex process, which requires arterial blood taking and use of a ABG analyzer, SpO2 measurement is much more used for continuous analysis of blood oxygen saturation in patients to estimate the arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) 22 . Moreover, many mobile phone brands contain built-in sensors and SpO2 can be measured by patients themselves.\n\nIn our cohorts, many patients had no blood gas data and therefore SpO2 was used as a variable in our model. Although SpO2 is not as accurate as PaO2 in critical illnesses, it could give the first indication of compromised lung gas exchange in the early stages of COVID-19, which would then be verified by ABG measurement upon admission to hospital.\n\nparticularly in sepsis 23, 24 . CD4 and CD8 T cell apoptosis causes prolonged infection by promoting virus survival 25 , and induces immune suppression to increase mortality in patients with sepsis 26 . In this study, we found a dramatic difference in lymphocyte counts between survivors and non-survivors. In non-survivors, the peripheral lymphocyte counts were very low .

LDH is released into circulation after cell injury or death 27 and serves as an index of the extent of cellular damage by the virus or the host immune response 28 .\n\nThis study has several limitations. At this stage in the global outbreak of COVID-19, no published studies have developed and validated prediction models for assessing the probability of mortality in hospitalized patients. A most recent report proposed SOFA score, age and Ddimers as the important prognostic markers 7 . However, in our cohorts, the SOFA score was very low although there is statistical difference between survivors and non-survivors. This difference may be due to some patients being treated in other hospitals prior to transfer in the previously reported study 7 . In addition, SOFA score relies on blood gas analysis, which cannot be easily done continually, in clinics and in under-resourced settings, thus making it difficult for clinicians to use readily. In addition, since D-dimer is not routinely requested, too many patients in our cohorts had no test performed, making it is difficult for us to verify published results. Organ-specific injury markers were not included in the model, including cTnI due to missing data (not routinely measured), as well as ALT and BUN due to high co-linearity with other variables within the model. Therefore, the choice of potential prognostic factors could not be informed by a systematic review of existing prediction models. Similarly, there are no published estimates of discrimination and calibration to compare this study to. Additionally, the event rate is limited, especially in the independent dataset where at least 100 events would be preferable 29 . A multicenter study with a larger cohort for model development and also for validation would add more power, reduce bias, and make the findings more generically applicable.\n\nThere is also inherent bias in the recruitment of patients because the Jinyintan hospital was the first officially designated receiving hospital in Wuhan for all COVID-19 cases at the start of the outbreak. The recruited patients were mainly self-referrals, but some were referred by other .

Self-referred patients are more likely to have severe symptoms that cause them to seek emergency medical help. Likewise, other hospitals are more likely to test patients who have more pronounced symptoms, thus creating an inherent bias in the patient sample. Therefore, the cohort may not accurately represent patients with mild or asymptomatic COVID-19. These results need to be further validated with patients who are hospitalized for different severities of illness. In conclusion, traditional early warning scores and organ injury markers do not help to predict severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Here, we have developed and validated a clinical prediction model using readily available clinical markers which is able to accurately predict mortality in people with COVID-19. This model can therefore be used in current pandemic regions to identify patients who are at risk of severe disease at an early enough stage to initialize intensive supportive treatment and to guide discussions between clinicians, patients and families. It has the potential to be used throughout the world following additional validation .
