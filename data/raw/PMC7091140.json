{"title": "1H, 13C and 15N resonance assignments of SARS-CoV main protease N-terminal domain", "body": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of the pandemic transmissible disease severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Peiris et al. 2003). SARS-CoV is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. During infection, two overlapping polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) are produced and further cleaved extensively by the main protease (Mpro) and the papain-like protease, yielding the components that assemble into the viral replication complex (Ziebuhr 2004). This makes Mpro essential for the viral life cycle and to be an attractive target for anti-SARS agent development (Anand et al. 2003).\n\nMpro exists in monomer\u2013dimer equilibrium in solution, and only the dimeric form is the enzymatically active form (Fan et al. 2004). Recently, a super active octamer form of Mpro which is formed by 3D domain-swapping of the C-terminal domains is observed (Zhang et al. 2010, Zhong et al. 2009). Crystal structures revealed that each protomer of Mpro is composed of an N-terminal domain (residues 1\u2013184) and an \u03b1-helical C-terminal domain (residues 201\u2013303) linked by a long loop (Yang et al. 2003). Mpro is also known as 3C-like protease (3CLpro) for it has similar substrate specificities to that of picornavirus 3C protease (3Cpro) and its N-terminal domain adopts a similar chymotrypsin-like fold as 3Cpro does. However, Mpro has an extra C-terminal domain which is required for Mpro to be active, and its role in activation remains to be elucidated.\n\nIn order to characterize the structural difference for the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV with and without the C-terminal extra domain, we have expressed the N-terminal domain alone (Mpro-N, residues 1\u2013199) in E. coli, which is well-folded and stable for acquisition of high-quality NMR spectra. Here, we report the nearly complete sequence-specific backbone and side-chain 1H, 13C and 15N resonance assignments of Mpro-N.\n\nThe uniformly 15N/13C-labeled or 15N-labeled Mpro-N protein was cloned and purified as previously described (Zhong et al. 2008). All NMR samples containing ~0.7 mM Mpro-N were in a buffer of 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 30 mM Arginine, 30 mM Glutamine acid, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT with 10% D2O.\n\nAll NMR experiments were performed on Bruker Avance 500 MHz, 600 MHz NMR, or 800 MHz spectrometers (all with cryoprobes) at 308 K. The backbone resonance chemical shift assignments were based on 2D 1H-15N HSQC, 3D HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)HN, HNCO, HN(CA)CO and HBHA(CO)NH NMR spectra. The side chain resonance chemical shift assignments were based on 3D HCCH-COSY, HCCH-TOCSY, (H)CCH-COSY, and (H)CCH-TOCSY NMR experiments data. All NMR spectra were processed with NMRPipe (Delaglio et al. 1995), and analyzed using NMRView (Johnson and Blevins 1994). The chemical shift in the 1H dimension was referenced directly to 2, 2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid (DSS), whereas the chemical shifts in the 13C and 15N dimensions were indirectly referenced to DSS.\n\nSARS-CoV Mpro-N contains 199 residues with a molecular weight of 21.9 kDa. The 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of Mpro-N is shown in Fig. 1, with the assignments indicated. More than 90% of backbone and side-chain resonances are assigned. The backbone NH signals for residues M6, F8, K12, N63 and S139 were missing in the 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectrum, while residues S1, G2, F3, R4, K5, G11 and F140 were completely unassigned. The secondary chemical shifts and chemical shift index (CSI) analysis indicate that the secondary structure of SARS-CoV Mpro-N is mainly in agreement with that in full length Mpro. The assigned 1H, 13C and 15N chemical shifts of the protein have been deposited in BioMagResBank (http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/) under the accession number 17251 (Fig. 2).\n\n"}
