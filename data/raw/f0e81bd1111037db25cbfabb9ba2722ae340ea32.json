{"title": "Cryo X-ray nano-tomography of vaccinia virus infected cells", "body": "The process of virus infection of eukaryotic cells is a classical example on how the coupling in the host cell of the assembly of viral structural components to their spatial and temporal organization leads to efficient production of progeny. Viral components are produced under a temporal control, and they are subsequently transported to the proper assembly sites using cellular pathways. These areas define assembly factories where the concentration and access of viral components are optimized. During these steps there are extensive interactions between viral and cellular components that have been studied for decades as a main target to design antiviral strategies, as well as an attractive model system to understand the molecular basis for cell control and macromolecular interactions. In particular, the role of cell membranes in the viral assembly has been extensively documented for many viral systems, including the involvement of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for rotavirus, the role of ER-Golgi intermediate compartment for coronavirus and poxvirus assembly and maturation, and the plasma membrane in the production of retrovirus, orthomyxovirus and paramyxovirus, among others (reviewed in Hunter, 2007) .\n\nThe study of viral life cycles involves the correlation of biochemical and structural approaches to yield the proper detailed description of the different steps of the cycle: specific recognition of the host, incorporation of the viral genome into the cell, transcription and replication of the genome, assembly of the infective virus and the final exit from the host cell (reviewed in Flint et al., 2009) . While improved visible light microscopy has been widely used for whole cell structural analyses of viral infection, the increasing demand of higher resolution to get deeper insights into these processes have led to the incremental use of powerful methods, as electron cryo-tomography (Lucic et al., 2005) , revealing molecular details albeit with the cost of a reduction of the complexity or scale of the sample, while increasing the sample preparation difficulty. The inherent limitation of the analysis at the cellular level (sample thicknesses about 300-500 nm for electron microscopes), together with the consequent lack of quantification due to the sample limitations imposed by high resolution methods, have become critical problems for the correlation of these qualitative structural data with the quantitative data derived from whole populations using biochemical, genetic and proteome analyses (Baumeister and Steven, 2000; Martone et al., 2003) .\n\nThere are different alternatives to overcome the resolution limits imposed either by visible light microscopy based analyses, or by the penetration power of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to deal with thick, whole cell samples. Different super-resolution visible light fluorescence microscopy methods (Galbraith and Galbraith, 2011; Jones et al., 2011) , and the use of improved sectioning methods in electron tomography (Pierson et al., 2010; Rigort et al., 2010) are opening new possibilities for the comprehensive study of the cellular cartography. The use of X-ray microscopy is another powerful alternative, based on the high penetration power of soft X-rays in the water window photon energy range (just below the O absorption K edge at 543 eV) in hydrated biological material (sample thicknesses 610 microns). The use of diffractive optics in full-field X-ray microscopes (Chao et al., 2005; Rehbein et al., 2009; Schneider et al., 1995) , together with the incorporation of cryogenic procedures for sample preparation and data acquisition (Schneider, 1998) , have led to the recent success of X-ray microscopy for 3-D imaging of cells yielding tomographic reconstructions at resolutions in the order of 20-30 nm (Hanssen et al., 2010; Larabell and Le Gros, 2003; Larabell and Nugent, 2010; Schneider et al., 2002 Schneider et al., , 2003 Schneider et al., , 2010 Weiss et al., 2000) .\n\nThe estimation of the effective resolution attainable by cryo Xray nano-tomography (cryo-X-nano-tomo) of whole cell samples is a critical parameter to evaluate its possibilities for the detailed analysis of the cartography of cellular components. A quantitative estimation for such a resolution was experimentally obtained by comparison of the tomographic reconstructions of a large and complex virus (VACV) using both X-ray and electron microscopies ). The resolution from X-ray tomograms using a zone plate of 25 nm was found to be only 3,7 times lower than that obtained from electron microscopy (i.e. 25.7 nm vs 6.7 nm), thus opening the possibility to resolve structural features of small cellular complexes and aggregates in whole cells at resolutions between light and electron microscopies. As those resolution estimations were done on purified virus preparations in buffer, a critical question is whether such features could be distinguished within the complex and crowded cellular media. In this work we show the possibility to detect VACV individual particles in the cytoplasm of an infected whole cell without chemical fixation, sectioning or labeling by cryo X-ray tomography with an estimated 3D-resolution up to 55 nm using a zone plate of 40 nm, which allowed fulfilling better depth of focus requirements.\n\nVaccinia virus (VAVC) is the best known member of the Poxviridae family. The virus particle is relatively large (360 \u00c2 270 \u00c2 250 nm 3 ), enclosing a core with a double stranded DNA containing more than 200 open reading frames coding for viral specific proteins (Cyrklaff et al., 2005; Moss, 2007) . The assembly of VACV is very complex, starting with the modification of cellular membranes at the ER by incorporation of viral proteins, giving rise to crescents. These modified membranes evolve to rounded immature virus particles (IV) which contain a complex viroplasm. The IVs incorporate viral DNA and they enter in a complex maturation process involving the reorganization of viral envelopes, the formation of a distinct core, and a severe change in the overall structure, yielding the characteristic brick-shaped mature virus (MV). These particles, although infective, are not the final form of the viral maturation: they are able to interact with the trans-Golgi network to produce a wrapped form of the virus (WV), which is transported towards the outer plasma membrane of the cell using a kinesinbased microtubular mechanism. Later in the infection cycle, the virus particles associate to the cell membrane and are further ejected from the cells using actin polymerization to efficiently spread the virus along large microvilli (reviewed in Flint et al., 2009; Moss, 2007) .\n\nThe maturation process of VACV is carried out entirely in the cell cytoplasm, and it involves multiple sets of temporal interactions between cellular membranes and other organelles with viral components. Due to the complexity of these interactions, their study has been difficult and several controversies related to the total number of viral membranes and their cellular origin are still open (reviewed in Rodriguez et al., 2006) . Part of these problems are derived from the fact that most of the studies were based on the very limited and partial information that is retrieved from ultra-thin sections of 50-100 nm from a total cell thickness of 10-20 lm or more. Furthermore, the electron microscope images from those sections overlap their structural features in two-dimensional projections, thus leading to conflicting interpretations. The use of electron tomography was a main step towards the understanding of the virus structure (Cyrklaff et al., 2005) , assembly ) and disassembly (Cyrklaff et al., 2007) . Tomographic reconstructions reveal genuine three-dimensional information, thus avoiding the superposition of information found in projected images. Nevertheless, even in these cases the information is retrieved from a small percentage of the volume of the whole cell, thus preventing the quantitative analysis of the viral life cycle at the cellular level. In an attempt to circumvent these problems, we have explored the combination of fast freezing of VACV infected cells with X-ray microscopy to get insights into the viral infection process at the whole cell level taking profit of the penetration power of X-rays. The VACV structural knowledge obtained by the analysis of the same cell type by standard electron microscopy approaches allowed us to identify the viral related structures within the X-ray tomograms. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to detect different types of viral assembly intermediates within the cytoplasm of whole cells. In addition, we studied the effect of radiation damage by TEM analysis of plastic embedded thin sections of X-ray irradiated cells. The results revealed no noticeable changes in the cellular ultrastructure during the tomographic data acquisition by X-ray microscopy.\n\nThe established chick embryo cell line DF-1 and PtK2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Cells were maintained in a humidified air 5% CO 2 atmosphere at 37\u00b0C. Virus infections were performed with 2% FCS for both cell types. The VACV strains used in this work include Western Reserve (WR), modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) obtained from the Ankara strain after 586 serial passages in primary chick embryo fibroblast cells (CEF) (derived from clone F6 at passage 585, kindly provided by G. Sutter, Germany) and MVA-C-DF1L expressing from the TK locus gp120 and Gag-Pol-Nef proteins of HIV-1 (subtype C) under the transcriptional control of the synthetic early/late promoter and with the anti-apoptotic virus F1L gene replaced by rsGFP gene (Perdiguero et al., in preparation).\n\nTo determine virus growth profiles, monolayers of PtK2 cells grown in 12-well tissue culture plates were infected at 0.01 PFU/ cell with WR, MVA or recombinant MVA-C-DF1L(GFP). Following virus adsorption for 60 min at 37\u00b0C, the inoculum was removed, the infected cells were washed once with DMEM without serum and incubated with fresh DMEM containing 2% FCS at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. At different post-infection times (0, 24, 48 and 72 h), cells were removed by scraping (cell lysates at 5 \u00c2 10 5 cells/ml), freeze-thawed three times and briefly sonicated. Infectious viruses in cell lysates were measured by immunostaining assay in DF-1 cells.\n\nVirus titers in cell lysates were determined by immunostaining assay according to the following protocol. Grow DF-1 cells in 6-well plates to reach near confluency. Make 10-fold serial dilutions of the virus in complete DMEM and add 0.4 ml of each dilution to cells. Incubate 1 h in a CO 2 incubator at 37\u00b0C, remove the inoculum and add complete DMEM+2% of NCS. At 48 h post-infection wash the 6-well plates with PBS and add 1:1 acetone/methanol for 2 min. Remove fixative and wash with PBS. Dilute rabbit polyclonal anti-vaccinia antibody (diluted 1:1000; CNB product) in PBS containing 3% FCS and add 1 ml/well. Incubate 1 h at room temperature with gentle rocking and wash three times with PBS. Dilute goat polyclonal anti-rabbit-HRP secondary antibody (SIGMA) in PBS containing 3% FCS at 1:1000 dilution and add 1 ml/well. Incubate 1 h at room temperature with gentle rocking and then wash three times with PBS. Make up diaminobenzidine (SIGMA) one tablet in 12 ml PBS. Filter the solution and just before use add 120 ll of 3% nickel sulfate and 12 ll of hydrogen peroxide (30% w/w). Add 500 ll of substrate solution to each well, rotate dish gently and let it stand approx. for 10 min. When the development is complete, wash the plate once with PBS. Count the number of stained foci and express titer as plaque forming units (PFU)/ml. A well containing between 50 and 100 spots is considered to be optimal for the calculation of the titer.\n\nPtK2 cells were cultured on coverslips in DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (fetal bovine serum), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco BRL, Life Technologies), 100 units of penicillin per ml and 100 lg of streptomycin per ml (Gibco BRL, Life Technologies). The cell line was grown as an adherent culture in an incubator (5% CO 2 ) at 37\u00b0C. After removing FBS from the growth medium during at least 8 h (to induce the particular flat morphology of this cell line), the cells were infected with MVA-C-DF1C(GFP) strain (Perdiguero et al., in preparation) , at a MOI (multiplicity of infection) of 10 PFU/cell. Following virus adsorption, cells were incubated for 60 min at 37\u00b0C with intermittent stirring; the cells were washed with DMEM and placed in fresh DMEM serum free at 37\u00b0C. At 18 h after infection, cell monolayers were either fast frozen by plunging in liquid ethane, or fixed. For routine fixation, cells were treated with a mixture of 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature.\n\nAu-grids of the HZB2 type were coated with either formvar/carbon or carbon film to grow PtK2 cells. The carbon films were prepared by electron beam evaporation onto mica and were then floated onto water and picked up with bare grids or formvarcoated grids. The grids were sterilized by at least 2 h-exposure to UV light. PtK2 cells were then cultivated and infected on the grids following the same protocol as that used for coverslips. Parallel cell cultures were done on coverslips and classical plastic support (plates) for culture quality assessment.\n\nThe HZB2 Carbon-Formwar or HZB2 Carbon Au-grids with the VACV infected cells were first imaged in vivo by visible light fluorescent microscopy in a Leica DMI6000B, and a SP5 confocal microscope with the 20X objective lenses. The samples, once imaged, were vitrified by plunge freezing in a Leica EM-CPC. The frozen grids were transferred to the HZB X-ray microscope (beamline U41 at the BESSY II electron storage ring (Berlin, Germany)) under cryogenic conditions. The GFP signal allowed us to identify infected cells after plunge freezing in the visible light fluorescent microscope (100\u00c2, NA = 0.75) which has been integrated in the HZB X-ray microscope. We used a photon energy (i.e. 510 eV) within the water window to take advantage of the high natural contrast of the biological material to acquire X-ray tomography data sets with the conditions described in Schneider et al., 2010) . More than 40 datasets were acquired using a zone plate objective with an outermost zone width of dr n = 40 nm, whereas a zone plate with dr n = 25 nm was used for the acquisition of 4 datasets. The effective pixel sizes in the images were 15.6 nm or 8.6 nm (with the 40 nm zone plate objective, depending on the magnification), and 9.7 nm (with the 25 nm objective). The image stacks were pre-processed to normalize and correct the intensity distribution delivered to the sample by the capillary condenser using flat field images in a program developed for XMIPP3.0 software package (Marabini et al., 1996; Scheres et al., 2008; Schneider et al., 2010; Sorzano et al., 2004) . Alignment of the tilted series was done with IMOD (Kremer et al., 1996) , and the final reconstructions were performed using the iterative SIRT reconstruction option in TOMO3D (Agulleiro and Fernandez, 2011) . To enhance the signal to noise levels we used TOMOBFLOW (Fernandez, 2009 ). The visualization and segmentation of the final volumes was carried out in Amira\u00d3, IMOD and Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004) . The 3D-resolution estimation was done using the same approach as in Carrascosa et al. (2009) .\n\nFor ultrastructural studies under electron microscopy, cells were cultured on coverslips and fixed in situ with a mixture of 2% paraformaldehyde (TAAB) and 2.5% glutaraldehyde (TAAB) (1 h at room temperature), washed with PBS and distilled water, post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in PBS (45 min), washed with distilled water, treated with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate (45 min), dehydrated with growing quantities of ethanol and embedded in epoxy resin 812 (TAAB) for 2 days at room temperature. Capsules were polymerized for 2 days at 60\u00b0C. Resin was detached from the coverslips by successive immersions in liquid nitrogen and hot water. Ultrathin, 70-nm-thick sections were cut in parallel to the monolayer, transferred to formvar-coated EM buttonhole grids and stained with aqueous uranyl acetate for 10 min and lead citrate for 3 min. Sections were visualized on a JEOL JEM 1200 EXII electron microscope (operating at 100 kV).\n\nFor comparative studies, infected cells were fast frozen by plunge freezing and processed for embedding in the acrylic resin Lowicryl HM23. Briefly, infected cells grown on HZB2 Au-grids were mounted in a plunging device and the excess of medium was removed by blotting with Whatman Nr.1 paper at the wider part of the front side of the grids, for less than 5 s. After plunging in liquid ethane, frozen specimens were either directly stored for X-ray microscopy inspection, or they were transferred into a Reichert-Jung AFS freeze-substitution unit (Leica, Vienna, Austria) and maintained for 60 h in pure methanol and 0.5% (w/v) uranyl acetate. Samples were then subjected to a controlled increase of temperature before being embedded in HM23 and polymerized with UV light, for 2 days at \u00c040\u00b0C, and then by 2 additional days at room temperature (22\u00b0C). Ultrathin (70 nm thick) sections were obtained, transferred to formvar-coated EM buttonhole grids as described before and post-stained twice: with uranyl acetate for 10 min and lead citrate for 3 min in a first round of staining, and with aqueous uranyl acetate overnight in a second round.\n\nThe 70 nm serial sections of fast frozen PtK2-infected cells were obtained with the Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems). Ribbons of 5-10 serial sections were sequentially distributed on formvar-coated EM buttonhole grids and subjected to uranyl acetate/lead citrate stain as described above. Specific cells were followed and imaged at low and high magnification, from the bottom to the top of these cells, in the whole set of serial sections.\n\nThe X-ray irradiated frozen samples were recovered after X-ray imaging and maintained in liquid nitrogen to be later subjected to freeze-substitution as described above. Once the capsules were polymerized, areas containing irradiated cells, as well as non-irradiated areas, were cut with a razor blade, removing the wider part of the grid. The remaining fragment was glued onto an Epoxy-resin capsule to allow mounting the fragment in the ultramicrotome. The selected irradiated and non-irradiated areas were identified due to the marks on the grid, and all the material around them was trimmed with a razor blade. In this way the cells of interest could be kept in the center of the block front. The Lowicryl HM23 excess on the surface of the grid was carefully removed with a razor blade. Usually, the rest of the metal grid was removed in this process without disturbing the surface of the block. A scheme for the workflow of this procedure is shown in Supplementary material Fig. S1 . Serial ultrathin (70 nm) sections were taken as described above, but in this case they were stained only once during 10 min with aqueous uranyl acetate and 3 min with lead citrate.\n\nPtK2 cells adopt a flat morphology after serum deprivation (Cyrklaff et al., 2007) . Eight hours after serum removal, PtK2 cells present a standard aspect albeit with some vacuolization (Fig. 1a, b, d). The thickness of these flatten cells is around 3-10 lm, depending on the cellular area, thus in the order of magnitude required for efficient freezing and X-ray transmission microscopy using the water window energy range (Kirz and Rarback, 1985; Schneider, 1998) . Infection of the flat PtK2 cells by MVA-C-DF1C(GFP) strain clearly increases vacuolization, as readily seen in visible light microscopy ( Fig. 1c) and in electron microscopy of thin sections of these cells (Fig. 1e) . This enhanced vacuolization is likely due to apoptotic events induced by virus infection, since the gene F1L encoding an inhibitor of apoptosis was deleted in the viral genome. Nevertheless, in spite of these vacuoles, the cells support VACV infection, as viral related structures were seen in these cells. To confirm that PtK2 cells were able to fully sustain virus infection, a virus growth-curve was performed. Cells were infected with MVA-C-DF1C(GFP) strain, and the virus production was measured at different times after infection using an immunostaining assay in DF-1 cells (Fig. 1f, g) . The kinetics of viral production found for VACV wild type and the two strains (MVA and the GFP containing MVA-C-DF1C(GFP)) were identical up to 24 h after infection, although differences in virus titers were observed at 72 h (probably due to the extensive cytopathic effect and the apoptosis events referred above). In addition, the plaque-size morphology between MVA and MVA-C-DF1C(GFP) were also similar. The findings of Fig. 1 demonstrate that PtK2 cells infected with MVA-C-DF1C(GFP) is a good system to follow virus infection and the assembly cycle.\n\nThe preservation of the cell ultrastructure is a critical aspect of the sample preparation for tomographic reconstructions. PtK2 cells were grown on the surface of gold microscope grids under serum deprivation, and infected with MVA-C-DF1C(GFP). The cells were collected after 18 h post-infection and fast frozen by liquid ethane plunging. The frozen cells were cryo-substituted as described in Section 2, and the samples were sectioned parallel to the substrate plane at different heights to study their preservation level using electron microscopy. Fig. 2 shows the aspect of different sections at increasing distances up to 3 lm towards the interior of the cell from the basal plane in contact with the substrate. The images show a uniform preservation with an overall good preservation of the cell cytoplasm and a reasonable delineation of mitochondria, vacuoles and filamentous structures. These results were consistent among different cells and preparations (up to 8 lm were tested), thus supporting that fast plunging in liquid ethane is a good choice for effective freezing of the relatively thin PtK2 cells.\n\nThe location of the regions of interest to be imaged is a key issue in X-ray microscopy. To select those cells which were infected by VACV among those cells grown on the surface of the microscope grids that were not infected (Fig. 3a) , PtK2 cells were infected with the MVA-C-DF1C(GFP) virus strain. This strain expresses the fluorescent protein GFP and, thus, infected cells can be easily detected by ''in vivo'' fluorescence (Fig. 3b) . This signal was used to map the position of the infected cells in the framework of the grid marks at room temperature. After freezing, the grids were transferred into the X-ray microscope under liquid nitrogen, and grid marks were used to locate the infected cell coordinates. This location was then cross-checked using the fluorescence microscope integrated in the X-ray microscope, as the GFP signal was clearly visible after plunge freezing (Fig. 3c) . Full-field projection images were collected from 10 to 15 lm thick frozen samples containing the infected cells as shown in Fig. 3d . The coordinates of these cell positions were used for collecting cryo X-nano-tomographic data sets (Fig 3d and e) .\n\nThe selected cell regions following the correlative approach described above were tilted in the X-ray microscope in 1\u00b0steps between +65\u00b0and \u00c065\u00b0using the X-ray microscope goniometer stage. Care was taken to check that after the series acquisition the area did not reveal visual evidences of radiation damage (i.e. a 0\u00b0p rojection image before starting the tilt series was compared to a 0\u00b0projection image after finishing the tilt series). The series of tilted projection images were aligned and processed as described in Section 2 to yield three-dimensional reconstructed volumes.\n\nThe different tomographic reconstructions obtained by cryo Xray microscopy of PtK2 cells consistently revealed well contrasted volumes, where the main cellular features were immediately evident ( Fig. 4a-d) . To make a straight identification of these features we performed a systematic comparison of the planes of the X-ray tomographic reconstructions with thin sections imaged by TEM of the same type of samples processed following two procedures. The first one was cryo-substitution and Lowicryl embedding, where the frozen cells were embedded in resin at low temperature, thus minimizing the dehydration induced effects. This preparation method closely mimics the sample cryo-fixation used for X-ray microscopy. The sections obtained from these samples were lightly stained with uranyl acetate to increase the contrast for a better visualization (Fig. 4e-h) . The second procedure consists on a more standard chemically fixed embedding in epoxy resin for sectioning. This method has been the classical way to identify virus-related structures due to the high contrast provided by an extensive use of staining reagents (osmium tetroxide, uranyl acetate and lead citrate, see Section 2) ( Fig. 4i-l) .\n\nFilamentous structures were evident in the basal side of the cell shown in the X-ray tomographic reconstruction (Fig. 4a) resembling those ones found at the same areas by electron microscopy in thin sections after cryo-substitution and uranyl acetate staining (Fig. 4e) . The appearance of these structures is similar to actin bundles as recognizable in the fully stained Epoxy-resin embedded samples (Fig. 4i) . The nucleus is especially well contrasted in the cryo X-ray tomograms (Fig. 4b) . Different chromatin aggregates are visible, as well as the nuclear envelope. The comparison with the stained Lowicryl (Fig. 4f) , and Epon sections (Fig. 4j ) reveals that the unstained X-ray tomograms offer at this magnification as much overall structural features as the conventional electron microscopy images. The mitochondria in infected PtK2 cells appear elongated with characteristic shapes in the electron microscope images from thin sections of Epon and Lowicryl embedded material ( Fig. 4k and g, respectively) . The same type of images can be found in the X-ray tomographic reconstructions (Fig. 4c) . Other cellular features, as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are more difficult to visualize unless a full staining method is applied (Fig. 4l) . In cryo-substituted Lowicryl sections the ER is hardly seen (Fig. 4h) , similar to the appearance of certain areas in the X-ray tomographic reconstructions (Fig. 4d) .\n\nThe X-ray tomograms of VACV infected PtK2 cells showed the presence of certain areas of the cytoplasm with characteristic features resembling the well documented vaccinia factories. These cytoplasmic regions are heavily modified by a high concentration of viral components that exclude cell organelles and membranes. These areas are frequently surrounded by filaments and mitochondria (Condit et al., 2006; Risco et al., 2002) . Fig. 5a shows a panoramic plane from an X-ray tomographic reconstruction, where there is a region near the nucleus that presents a distinct aspect respect to other cytoplasmic areas. This type of area has not been seen in X-ray tomograms from uninfected cells, and it resembles genuine viral factories that are also found by electron microscopy of thin sections of cryo-substituted PtK2 infected cells embedded in Lowicryl (Fig. 5c) , and in fully stained sections processed for Epoxy-resin embedding (Fig. 5e) .\n\nHigher magnification images obtained near the viral factorylike regions in the X-ray tomographic reconstructions (with an estimated 3D-resolution up to 55 nm), show the presence of two types of particles, which differ in their shape and size: one is more rounded (diameter around 350 nm) and it encloses a medium density material, while the other is smaller (diameter around 250 nm) and much more dense, as it appears darker (Fig. 5b, insets) . The overall characteristics of these particles are similar to the standard views of the two main VACV assembly intermediate particles (immature virus, IV, and internal mature virus, MV), as defined by electron microscopy of cryo-substituted infected cell Lowicryl sections (Fig. 5d) , and Epon stained sections (Fig. 5f) .\n\nPlanes along the X-ray tomographic reconstructions reveal a compartmentalization of the different viral particles: the IVs aggregated in areas near the nuclei (Fig. 6a) , while MVs are grouped towards the cell periphery (Fig. 6b) . Closer examination of the viral factories and the viral-related particles in their neighborhood reveals the presence of viroplasm coupled to crescent-like and incomplete IVs (Fig. 6c) . In the periphery of these areas there is an accumulation of IVs that delineate a transition zone towards the areas where MVs accumulate (Figs. 6b, 5b) . The appearance of the intracellular particles associated to MVs within the cell cytoplasm (Fig. 6e, f) is similar to the tomographic reconstructions obtained for the isolated, ice embedded VACV using cryo X-ray nanotomography . 3.6. Analysis of the radiation damage induced during X-ray tomographic data acquisition Acquisition of images during X-ray microscopy, even under cryogenic conditions, involves the exposure of the sample to radiation, thus generating chemical and physical damages to it. The average irradiation for the acquisition of an image in the HZB Xray microscope used in these experiments (beamline U41 at BESSY II, 5 \u00c2 10 8 photons/lm 2 at 510 eV) might be estimated to around 5 \u00c2 10 7 Gy per image, which amounts up to around 5 \u00c2 10 9 Gy for the collection of a complete tomography data set. Although the radiation damage problem has been thoroughly studied in electron cryo-microscopy, much less detailed measurements exist in the case of X-ray microscopy. To get an insight into how this radiation level might affect the structural information retrieved by X-ray microscopy at the magnification and resolution attainable in these experiments, we compared the ultrastructure of samples obtained before and after X-ray irradiation using electron microscopy of thin sections from these samples.\n\nTo this end, we collected the frozen X-ray irradiated grids which were used for the tomographic data acquisition described above. The specific marks on the HZB2 grids allowed us to identify those areas were tilt series were acquired (heavily irradiated) from those areas which suffered only marginal irradiation during the screening procedure. The grids were kept under liquid nitrogen and subsequently they were freeze-substituted and plastic embedded as described in Section 2. The areas were selected using the grid features (related to the regions of interest defined by the correlative microscopy described above), and then serial ultrathin sections were produced and processed for observation by electron microscopy (Fig 7) . The overall ultrastructure of cells in the irradiated areas (Fig. 7c) did not show significant differences to those cells in non-irradiated areas (Fig. 7a) . Although the sections derived from heavily irradiated areas showed a slightly faster staining than the non-irradiated ones, in both cases the cytoplasmic aspect, as well as the definition of the different organelles are undistinguishable (Fig. 7b, d) . Furthermore, the two types of viral-related particles (IVs and MVs) showed identical features, including their outer envelopes and viroplasm density (Fig. 7b, d; insets) .\n\nThe incorporation of X-ray microscopy to the analysis of biological materials is based on the possibility to penetrate large cellular volumes (up to 10 lm) to retrieve chemical and structural information at resolutions intermediate between light and electron microscopy. The combination of methods based on cryogenic sample preparation and image acquisition at low temperatures has led to the three-dimensional reconstruction of frozen cells revealing their internal structures (Hanssen et al., 2010; Larabell and Le Gros, 2003; Schneider et al., 2010; Weiss et al., 2000) . Here we have studied the structure of cells infected with VACV in an attempt to get clues on the possibility to detect relatively small structural features within the whole cell cytoplasm. Although purified vaccinia virus particles were seen by cryo X-ray tomography without any fixative or staining , their detection within the crowded cellular cytoplasm was not evident. The combination of light, electron and X-ray microscopy allows following different cellular features at complementary 3D resolution levels without using any fixative or contrasting reagent. To correlate the different microscopy methods we used a fluorescent probe associated to the expression of GFP by an engineered strain of VACV. Regions of interest were detected by means of the fluorescence characteristic of the infected cells, which were observed in the fluorescent light microscope at room temperature as well as after freezing the cells, allowing us to identify the relevant cells under the X-ray microscope using grid coordinates marks.\n\nThe cryo X-ray nano-tomograms from VACV infected cells showed a number of well preserved cellular organelles, whose structures were readily recognizable by comparison to the corresponding thin sections of equivalent samples subjected to chemical fixation and staining imaged by electron microscopy. The resolution level attained in our cryo X-ray tomograms is such that it has been possible to detect cytoplasmic regions modified by the viral infection (viral factories), as well as two distinct types of viral particles, the IVs and the MVs. The morphological features shown in the frozen, unstained samples reconstructed from X-ray tomograms are comparable, albeit at a slightly lower resolution, to the structures described by electron microscopy of thin sections of chemically fixed and stained material. However, the main difference between these electron and X-ray microscopy results is that the former correspond to 70 nm sections of the cell, while the later derive from whole 10 to 12 lm thick cells, thus avoiding the biased interpretation derived from the analyses of partial cellular volumes, and opening the way to quantitative studies of the viral infection process at improved resolutions, including also the macromolecular events associated to the cytopathic effects produced in the course of virus infections. Fig.7 . Ultrastructure comparison after X-ray irradiation. HZB2 grids used for cryo X-ray tomography were subjected to freeze-substitution and embedding in Lowicryl resin. Areas containing irradiated and non-irradiated cells were identified based on grid marks and features. Thin sections were obtained by ultramicrotomy and observed by electron microscopy. (a) .Cell section from a non-irradiated area. N marks the position of the nucleus, VF marks a viral factory. Scale bar represents 2 microns. (b) Higher magnification detail of the cytoplasm from (a). C shows a viral crescent, IV immature virus and MV mature virus. The left inset shows a magnified view of an IV, and the right inset a MV. Scale bar represents 500 nm. (c) Section of a heavily X-ray irradiated cell used to collect two full X-ray tomographic data sets. N marks the position of the nucleus, VF marks a viral factory. The scale is the same as in (a). (d) Higher magnification detail of the cytoplasm from (c). IV shows immature virus and MV mature virus. The left inset shows a magnified view of an IV, and the right inset a MV. Scale bar represents 500 nm.\n\nA main drawback in electron and X-ray microscopy is radiation damage. The use of cryogenic temperatures lowers the damage, but it is a main limiting factor for these microscopy methods that has to be minimized using as low dosages as possible to collect useful information (Knapek and Dubochet, 1980) . We have done a preliminary estimation of the effect of X-ray irradiation during tomographic data collection by comparison of the ultrastructure observed by electron microscopy from thin sections of infected cells derived either from X-ray irradiated or non-irradiated material. By collecting the samples after X-ray tomography, and using the marks on the HZB2 microscope grid to identify those cells which were irradiated during tomographic tilt series, we embedded those areas in resin for thin sectioning and observation under the electron microscope. The ultrastructure revealed by electron microscopy showed an overall similar aspect of the cytoplasmic background, while the main structural features of the cell organelles remained basically similar to those seen in non-irradiated areas. Even the structural details characteristic of the two types of viral-related particles (IVs and MVs) were identical with and without X-ray irradiation. Our results show for the first time that the irradiated areas preserve most of the ultrastructure as defined at the thin section electron microscopy level. Further detailed analysis will be required in the future to fully understand the effect of X-ray radiation damage during cryo X-ray imaging at improved resolutions."}
