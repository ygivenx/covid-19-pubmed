{"title": "COVID-19 Epidemic in Switzerland: Growth Prediction and Containment Strategy Using Artificial Intelligence and Big Data", "body": "Swiss public and private transport network that is simulated to assess transmission of the COVID-19\n\nvirus. The individual contacts within the population, and possible transmission pathways, are established from a simulation of daily activities that are calibrated with micro-census data. Various governmental interventions with regards to closures and social distancing are also implemented. The epidemiology of the COVID-19 virus is based on publicly available statistical data and adapted to Swiss demographics. The predictions estimate that between 22 February and 11 April 2020, there will be 720 deaths from 83'300 COVID-19 cases, and 73'300 will have recovered; our preliminary variability in these estimates is about 21% over the aforementioned period. In the absence of governmental intervention, 42.7% of the Swiss population would have been infected by 25 April 2020 compared to our prediction of a 1% infection over this time period, saving thousands of lives. It is argued that future scenarios regarding relaxation of the lockdown should be carefully simulated, as by 19 April 2020, there will still remain a substantial number of infected individuals, who could retrigger a second spread of COVID-19. Through the use of a digital tool, such as Enerpol, to evaluate in a data-driven manner the impacts of various policy scenarios, the most effective measures to mitigate a spread of COVID-19 can be devised while we await the deployment of large-scale vaccination for the population globally. By tailoring the spatio-temporal characteristics of the spread to match the capacity of local healthcare facilities, appropriate logistic needs can be determined, in order not to overwhelm the health care services across the country.\n\n.

A rapid escalation of COVID-19 cases has been observed globally, as COVID-19 has high transmission rates as well as a relatively long incubation period, 2,3 during which carriers without obvious symptoms can re-transmit to others.\n\nThere are currently neither antiviral drugs nor vaccines available for COVID-19. It is anticipated that within 12 to 18 months, vaccines could become to be available for the general public; also, it is plausible that vaccines could be used in an earlier experimental phase for public health workers.\n\nThus, the current crisis has forced public authorities around the world to manage this outbreak by limiting social contacts and by the extensive use of protective clothing and disinfectants.\n\nAdditionally, limitations on the movement of people and the closing of national and international transportation have been implemented. The primary goal of public authorities is to manage the outbreak so as to avoid overwhelming the health care system, in addition to buy time in order to bring online more capacity and resources that can handle the current and potential future peaks in the demand for emergency services. As such, there is an acute need to better understand the temporal growth of the outbreak (both symptomatic and asymptomatic), the geographic distribution of the outbreak, and the evolution of hot spots in the outbreak.\n\nSwitzerland is one of the countries that is most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. On 16 March 2020, the Swiss government declared an \"extraordinary situation\" over COVID-19, promoting social distancing measures, instituting a ban on all private and public events, closing schools nationwide, and closing places such as restaurants, bars, sports and cultural spaces; only businesses that provide essential goods remain open. These measures are in force until 19 April 2020. Effective 21 March 2020, the government further limited gatherings, throughout the country, to no more than 5 people.\n\nThe Swiss government did not explicitly prohibit the movement of people but provided the population very stern recommendations to follow these rules. Based on the anecdotal evidence of relatively law-abiding nature of most of the Swiss population, it is expected that an overwhelming majority will follow the measures, which would significantly reduce the spread of the pandemic.\n\nIn this study, a prognosis of the evolution of the disease is predicted using an existing agent-based, artificial intelligence, simulation platform. 4 The entire 8.57 million population of Switzerland, including social adaptation and current government policy, are considered. The economic slowdown and the transition in the use of Switzerland's public and private transportation system are also .

Furthermore, calibrated probabilistic sub-models account for demographics, and the period needed for recovery that are required to handle the COVID-19 cases.\n\nOur agent-based simulation framework, EnerPol, which accounts for 100% of the entire population of Switzerland, and that was applied to scenarios of influenza in Switzerland, 4 is used. EnerPol is a holistic agent-based model with choice models, where the agents adapt their behaviour through artificial intelligence as part of the solution. A schematic of EnerPol modules that are used for the agent-based simulation of epidemic spread is shown in Figure 1 . The mortality rate due to COVID-19 in multiple countries, including South Korea and Italy, has been shown to be strongly coupled to pre-existing conditions, specifically hypertension and heart disease, diabetics and lung disease. 8, 9 Given that the profile of chronic diseases in the Swiss population differs slightly from that in the South Korean population, 10,11 the mortality rates observed in the spread of COVID-19 in South Korea were linearly adjusted for the case of Switzerland.\n\nBy performing a large number of simulations and machine learning steps, the approximate initial start date of the infection was determined to be Saturday 22 February 2020, when the simulation is 5 seeded with 46 cases, whose geographic locations are based on the reported occurrences of COVID-19 in Switzerland. 12 This date and seeding best match the observed ramp up of the spread of COVID-19 in Switzerland; this date and seeding were kept constant for the baseline study reported here.\n\nThe simulations are perfomed with 15 minute temporal resolution for a 90 day period in order to evaluate the evolution of the spread of COVID-19, and the rate of recovery throughout the country.\n\nResults and discussion: Due to a lack of available testing equipment, the Swiss authorities initially only tested the symptomatic individuals of the 65+ demographic, but then later added more testing for younger demographic groups. In Figure 4 , we compare, on a daily basis, our predictions of the 65+ demographic COVID-19 cases to data from Switzerland's Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH). It is not known to the authors whether, how, or over what time from the start of the pandemic, additional groups were also tested, which may partly explain the differences between our predictions and the data. Figure 5 compares the predicted and reported total numbers of death due to COVID-19. Our prediction estimates by 18 April 2020, a total of 720 deaths, of which 81% (586) are from the 65+ demographic. patients. It should be noted that the COVID-19 cases include both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, and as such the predicted number of COVID-19 cases is significantly higher than the officially reported confirmed COVID-19 cases which are a subset of the total number of cases. The demographic distribution of COVID-19 infected individuals on 11 April 2020 is shown in Figure 8 .\n\nIt is evident that the 30 to 59 year age range constitue the majority of COVID-19 cases. The demographic distribution of deaths is shown in Figure 9 . The vulnerability of those over 60 years is seen, and the extreme vulnerability of the 70-80 demographic is evident. Figure 10 shows the demographic distribution of mortality of in the Switzerland's whole population of infected and uninfected persons. It can be seen that with the current government interventions, the mortality is below 1% for the entire population, but still a major cause for concern particularly for the elderly. \n\nUtilizing publicly available data, a holistic bottom-up agent-based simulation of the current COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland is presented as a reference case. The initiation, growth and containment of the COVID-19 spread in presented, and quantified in terms of the infected (symptomatic and asymptomatic), recovered and deaths. Using the same simulation tool, it is shown that without social adaptation and governmental intervention, an explosive spread of the COVID-19 virus would have resulted in an infection of 42.7% of the entire population by 25 April 2020; on the otherhand the government's timely intervention resulted in less than 1% of the population being infected for the examined time period. This shows that it is critical for goverments to step in, at an early stage to contain and manage pandemics and minimize mortality rates in the coming months. As restrictions become less prevelant, the infection rate and the associated mortality will undoubtedly increase.\n\nAs with any model simulation, there are uncertainties in our predictions. One of the key uncertainties is the exact behavioural profile of the first 50 or so seed carriers, whose contact behaviour results in variations in the initial phase of the growth of the pandemic. This illustrates the significance of early detection of new infected cases in all age groups, followed by contact-tracing of the individuals for the prior 8 to 10 days. Rapid and large scale testing would be crucial at this stage.\n\nThe use of South Korean data in this study was very much linked to the appropriate reaction of the South Korean government to quickly test all suspected infected cases and not just the elderly. Other key improvements that are currently being developed is the need for the refining the future model fidelity by examining the exact trajectory of social behavior adaptation and modeling at a lower transmissivity rate, due to more disinfection of surfaces and contact avoidance.\n\nAnother issue of our existing model is that hospitals and health care facilities are not specifically differentiated due to the unavailability of reliable data. There seems to be some indication 13 that, when health care facilities are overwhelmed by demand and have limited resources, these facilities themselves can become a hot zone of significant additional infections to staff and visitors. Once additional data become available, this limitation can be addressed in future work. As the first peak subsides, the role of imported new COVID-19 cases will again play a more significant role in the containment of COVID-19.\n\nWith large scale vaccination of the population some time away, the key question for the emergency management team would be on how to manage the pandemic, while minimizing the enormous economic and social impacts of isolation and the full-to-partial shutdown of the society including the transportation system and crossborder movement. Thus, in on-going work we are using scenario-9 based analysis to quantify the sensitivity of various interventions in order to better match the resulting demand for healthcare to the available local resources, in order to avoid overwhelming the system while waiting for the deployment of vaccination, which will hopefully come soon."}
