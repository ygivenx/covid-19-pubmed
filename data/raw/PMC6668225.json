{"title": "rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP (also designated V920) recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotyped with Ebola Zaire Glycoprotein: Standardized template with key considerations for a risk/benefit assessment", "body": "a.VSV (a negative sense, single-strand RNA virus belonging to the family Rhabdoviridae, genus Vesiculovirus) is being widely explored for vaccine development against infectious diseases and cancer, and as an oncolytic virus.b.VSV causes self-limited disease in horses, pigs, and cattle, and may be either asymptomatic or cause a mild flu-like syndrome in humans and is thus a naturally attenuated vector backbone for development of human vaccines and therapies.c.Other advantages of VSV as a vector include (i) low prevalence of immunity to the vector in most populations targeted for immunization; (ii) the viral RNA does not integrate into the host, posing little risk of oncogenesis or mutagenesis; (iii) large foreign transgenes can be packaged and expressed; (iv) the virus may be pseudo-typed with heterologous viral glycoproteins presented in the envelope in their natural conformation.d.There are two major VSV serotypes (VSV-Indiana and VSV-New Jersey). VSV-Indiana (VSV-I) is the basis for current vaccine candidates. Other related vesiculoviruses, such as Isfahan virus [11] and Maraba virus [12], and more distantly related rhabdoviruses, such as rabies virus are also being explored as viral vectors [13].e.The VSV genome consists of \u223c11,000 nucleotides encoding five major proteins. The VSV glycoprotein (G) located in the viral envelope is responsible for attachment to cells, fusion with endosomal membranes at low pH and release of viral genomic RNA into the cytoplasm. The G protein also elicits protective immunity against VSV.f.Using reverse genetic systems, VSV vectors have been constructed expressing genes from divergent species, including many viruses (e.g. Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Lassa fever virus, HIV, influenza virus, EV71, HPV and others, see template), bacteria [14], and tumor antigens [15]. In some constructs, a portion of the VSV G protein is retained to facilitate expression or enable fusion and internalization of the recombinant virus [8]. VSV vectors completely lacking the VSV G gene (VSV\u0394G) must reconstitute the attachment, fusion and budding (release) functions with one or more proteins encoded by the heterologous envelope gene. In the case of rVSV\u0394G-influenza, for example, VSV G was replaced with influenza hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA) or both; only virus expressing both HA and NA in the same vector produced replication-competent pseudo-type virus [16], since both proteins play a role in attachment and because NA is needed for virus release from host cells. Similarly, in the case of a henipavirus (Nipah), a pseudo-type expressing the Nipah glycoprotein (G) responsible for cell attachment did not produce replicating virus unless a fusion protein [F protein of Nipah or the glycoprotein (GP) of Ebola Zaire] was coexpressed [17].g.Replicating rVSV\u0394G pseudotypes with glycoprotein (GP) derived from many different filoviruses [Ebola zaire, Ebola sudan, Ebola reston, Marburg, Bundibugyo, Tai Forest, and Lloviu have been constructed [18], [19], [20], with the GP providing virus attachment and class I fusion functions. The most advanced vaccine candidate described in this template is rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP expressing Zaire Ebola virus (ZEBOV) GP in place of the VSV-I G protein.h.The reverse genetics system producing rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP involves co-transfection of cells with plasmids containing the entire VSV genome with G deleted and replaced with ZEBOV GP, together with helper plasmids expressing the VSV N, P, and L genes [28]. Transcription of the plasmids is controlled by bacteriophage T7 polymerase supplied by baby hamster kidney cells expressing T7 (as done for rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP) or exogenously by a recombinant vaccinia expressing T7 polymerase.i.The rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP is constructed with full-length GP anchored in the viral envelope, whereas native ZEBOV expresses an abundant soluble form of GP without the transmembrane domain (soluble GP, sGP), which may act as a decoy for antibody contributing to evasion of neutralizing antibody during filovirus infection [21]. As, rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP generates no sGP it is more efficiently neutralized by antibody than wild-type ZEBOV [22].j.The full length heterologous GP is incorporated into the rVSV particle, which retains typical bullet shaped morphology, the viral envelope being decorated with ZEBOV GP spikes instead of VSV G protein spikes. The GP spike is composed of disulfide linked subunits, GP1 and GP2. Three GP1 subunits form a 3-bladed propeller-like trimer consisting of the receptor binding domains, glycosylated mucin-like domains and glycan caps. The glycans are hypothesized to shield epitopes from neutralizing antibody [23], [24]. However this is uncertain, since neutralization can occur prior to cleavage of the mucin-like domain in the endosome. Moreover, a mutated rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP lacking GP1 glycans was not more efficient in eliciting neutralizing antibodies in mice [26].k.In standard EM studies, insertion of Ebola GP into rVSV particles did not alter typical bullet-shaped vesiculovirus morphology. However, while the structure of the ZEBOV GP has been partially resolved by cryo-EM at high resolution [23] that of GP in pseudo-typed VSV has not been elucidated.l.The cell targets for infection, determined by virus ligand-cell receptor interactions, may differ for virus pseudo-typed with ZEBOV GP compared to natural VSV, although there may be overlapping tropisms. Certain cell lines susceptible to VSV but not ZEBOV, such as Jurkat cells and insect cells, do not permit rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP replication [18], [26]. The primary in vivo ZEBOV targeted cells are thought to be endothelial cells, monocytes, macrophages, and myeloid dendritic cells [27]. Although this is also presumed to hold true for the pseudo-typed rVSV, there is no systematic study of the cell types productively infected by rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP in vivo. Consistent with ZEBOV GP-specific tropism, a limited number of observations suggest that endothelial cells are a target for rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP [28] and a biodistribution study in macaques showed that the vaccine virus targeted lymphoreticular tissues [Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA, NewLink Genetics Corp, unpublished data, 2017]. Interestingly, a study in swine (unpublished, described in the template) showed that rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP induced self-limited clinical disease, histopathology and cell tropism, similar to that induced by wild-type VSV. Although pigs are also susceptible to ZEBOV by the respiratory route [29], pathogenesis is distinct from that caused by VSV. Thus, in swine, the pathogenesis of the host-virus pairing appears to match that of the vector backbone rather than the donor of the heterologous envelope. Possibly, the retention of the intact VSV M gene, a virulence factor of VSV [30], in the recombinant rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP vector plays a role in pathogenesis for swine. These observations provide fertile ground for future research in mechanisms of viral pathogenesis.m.Both wild type ZEBOV and rVSV pseudo-typed with ZEBOV GP appear to enter the cell by macropinocytosis in a GP protein-dependent manner [31]. The cell receptors initiating this process remain poorly defined and entry does not appear to involve clathrin (in contrast, VSV G protein binds low-density lipoprotein receptors and enters via receptor-mediated endocytosis by a clathrin-dependent pathway [32]). C-type lectins (e.g. DC-SIGN) are putative cell surface receptors for ZEBOV GP [33]. However, a critical virus-cell receptor interaction is intracellular, an important consideration for immune recognition. Once in the endosome, proteolytic processing is initiated by cathepsin proteases, after which GP1 binds to receptors on endosomal membranes, predominantly the Niemann-Pick C1 protein [34]. Cleavage of the mucin-like domain and the glycan cap on G1 are required for receptor binding to occur [23]. At low pH, conformational rearrangement of GP2 exposes a hydrophobic fusion loop which is inserted into the endosome membrane followed by internalization of the viral RNA. Neutralization of Ebola virus by antibody involves multiple different mechanisms, including blocking cathepsin-mediated proteolytic cleavage of GP1, blocking binding of GP1 to Niemann Pick C1 receptors, and inhibition of GP2 mediated fusion [35], [36].n.Since the VSV G gene is deleted in rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP, anti-vector immunity is minimized as a factor for primary immunization or sequential use of vectors expressing different heterologous genes.o.Complete deletion of VSV G protein and replacement by the heterologous transgene, as in rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP, results in a highly attenuated phenotype. Removal of VSV G, the principal virulence factor, is critical to this attenuation, since constructs retaining G or a portion thereof show varying degrees of residual neurovirulence when injected directly into the brain of young mice [8].p.Attenuation of the rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP vaccine candidate has been extensively studied. Neurovirulence is a feature of parental VSV infection following intracranial injection of most animal species (see template, Table 2), whereas the rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP virus is pathogenic only for infant (not adult) mice and caused minimal histopathology without clinical signs after intracranial inoculation in non-human primates [37]. No clinical, biochemical or pathoanatomical effects were observed in mice, rats, and nonhuman primates in formal toxicology studies where the vaccine was administered IM at the full human dose (see template). The rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP vaccine (V920) has now been administered to over 20,000 persons in Phase 1\u20133 and expanded access clinical trials and has been shown to have a favorable safety profile and to be generally well tolerated.q.VSV pseudo-types can propagate to high titers in mammalian cells, although some degree of attenuation is observed compared to wild-type VSV [18]. As VSV is an interferon-sensitive virus, interferon deficient cells, such as Vero cells, are particularly productive. Vero cells are widely used for manufacturing other vaccines, including multiple licensed, live attenuated vaccines (e.g. poliovirus, smallpox virus, rotavirus, dengue virus). The rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP virus grows to \u223c8.0 log10 plaque-forming units/mL (PFU/mL) in Vero cells without serum or animal derived components. The virus can then be clarified by filtration and purified and concentrated by a straightforward process involving enzyme digestion and ultrafiltration/diafiltration without chromatography and with minimal product loss. This manufacturing process has been up-scaled to produce large quantities of vaccine and is undergoing validation at a dedicated facility.r.Many live, replicating vaccines are susceptible to thermal instability and require lyophilization for long term storage. Because of the short development time for rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP during the West African Ebola emergency in 2014\u20132015, the vaccine was produced and stored in unit dose containers as a frozen liquid formulation, stored at \u2264\u221260 \u00b0C. Interestingly, the vaccine was found to be stable when thawed and held at 2\u20138 \u00b0C for at least 2 weeks, a feature that facilitates distribution for use in control of outbreaks.s.The rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP vaccine has been extensively tested in nonhuman primates with respect to immunogenicity and protective efficacy (see template, Table 2). The published literature has been supplemented by multiple additional studies, largely aimed at determining the immune correlate(s) of protection which may then be bridged to human immune responses elicited by the rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP vaccine. These efforts are ongoing. In one study, IgM subclass antibodies were suggested to play a dominant role in rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV immunity compared to IgG [38] but this observation has not been further investigated.t.Inoculation of rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP is followed by rapid appearance of viremia and activation of innate immune responses, including NK cells, which are believed to be at least partially responsible for protection against challenge given 3\u20137 days after vaccination [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48] or shortly before vaccination (i.e. post exposure vaccination [113]). GP-specific IgG antibodies appear between 7 and 14 days after vaccination and tend to peak at 28 days. A signature of innate immune markers appearing during the first few days after vaccination was found to correlate with antibody levels appearing later. Predominant among the independent markers were IP-10 and CXCR6 expression on NK cells on day 1 as independent correlates. These observations are consistent with other live viral vaccines, such as yellow fever vaccine, showing predictive innate signatures that shape the adaptive response [39].u.The role of neutralizing antibodies in protection elicited by rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP vaccine remains uncertain. The vaccine elicits robust neutralizing antibody responses following vaccination as measured by plaque reduction with the homologous (vaccine) virus, or in a ZEBOV pseudo-virion assay but neutralization titers against wild-type virus appear to be low [47]. The repertoire of antibodies elicited by the vaccine is not yet known, but it is clear that neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are highly protective; passive immunization with certain monoclonal antibodies can abrogate infection and prevent illness/death in the NHP model even when given up to 5 days after challenge [40]. In addition to neutralization, non-neutralizing antibodies with functional activities, including ADCC [40] and phagocytosis are probable secondary mediators; moreover, cooperative effects of non-neutralizing antibodies may enhance the potency of neutralizing antibodies [41].v.There have been few studies of T cell responses in NHPs or humans vaccinated with rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP. However, the vaccine does not appear to elicit robust T cell responses in NHPs [42]. Moreover, T cell depletion studies in vaccinated NHPs indicated that CD8+ T cells did not play a role in protection [42]. In humans, broad T cell activation was observed by Day 7 after vaccination, but ZEBOV specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses were seen only at the higher vaccine dose (2 \u00d7 107 pfu) [43], consistent with antibodies being the predominant mediator of protection.w.A substantial experience has now accumulated on the safety, immunogenicity and protective efficacy of rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP in humans (Table 1). It is remarkable that this effort was carried out by a coalition of multiple international partners over a short period of time and during an international public health emergency in West Africa [44]. The logistical problems and solutions encountered in one of the large trials are chronicled in a recent series of publications [J Infect Dis 2018:217 (Suppl. 1)].x.Key aspects of the Phase 1\u20133 clinical trials, which have engaged >18,000 participants are detailed in the template. Overall, when administered at the selected nominal dose of 2 \u00d7 107 pfu, rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP vaccine has proven to be safe and well tolerated. During the first few days after vaccination, many vaccinees experience an acute-phase reaction with fever, headache, myalgia, and arthralgia of short duration; this period is associated with a low-level viremia, activation of anti-viral genes, and increased levels of chemokines and cytokines [28], [39], [125]. Oligoarthritis and rash appearing in the second week, occur in a minority of subjects, and are typically mild-moderate in severity and self-limited. Vesicular mucosal lesions are infrequent. The arthritis and skin events appear to reflect direct viral injury and inflammation and do not have an immunopathological basis [28], [48]. As with any new vaccine, very rare adverse events may not be detected until accumulation of a large safety data base (1\u20133 million persons immunized).y.The clinical trials have shown the vaccine to be highly immunogenic across a broad dose range of 3 \u00d7 103\u20131 \u00d7 108 pfu, with >95% of subjects developing IgG binding antibodies (ELISA using recombinant GP antigen) and neutralizing antibodies (using several different methods, but predominantly plaque reduction method with pseudo-typed virus, e.g. rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP) (Table 1, Table 2) [28], [46], [47], [48]. Lower levels of neutralizing antibody to wild-type Ebola have been observed [28] possibly due to competition with sGP. IgG and neutralizing antibodies appear between days 7\u201314, peak on day 28, and plateau thereafter for at least 24 months.z.All studies in humans (and most in NHP) have used the IM route of administration, and there has been no comparison to subcutaneous (SC) delivery. This is simply a reflection of the rapid pace of development of the vaccine.aa.Efficacy of rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP vaccine was demonstrated in a large ring vaccination trial in Guinea in which contacts of an Ebola case and contacts of contacts were randomized to receive a single injection of 2 \u00d7 107 pfu rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP vaccine immediately or after a 21-day delay. [49], [50] Analysis of efficacy in the randomized rings compared all vaccinated subjects in the immediate arm (2119 subjects in 51 rings) to all eligible subjects who consented on Day 0 in the delayed arm (1435 subjects in 46 rings). Ten cases of confirmed EVD (in 4 rings) were observed in eligible subjects in the delayed vaccination arm who consented on Day 0 while no cases of EVD occurred in the vaccinated subjects in the immediate arm >10 days after vaccination. The calculated vaccine efficacy in this analysis was 100% (95% CI: 63.5\u2013100%, p = 0.0471). This remarkable trial was conducted at the tail end of the West African epidemic and underpins the regulatory review towards licensure of the vaccine, as well as pre-approval use in controlling outbreaks of Ebola virus disease.ab.A summary of all clinical trials employing rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP is provided in Table 1.\n\nThe findings, opinions, conclusions, and assertions contained in this consensus document are those of the individual members of the Working Group.
