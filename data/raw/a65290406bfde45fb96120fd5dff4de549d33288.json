{"title": "Structure and function of the signal recognition particle (SRP)", "body": "Meyerhofstr. 1, Postfach 102209 6900 Heidelberg\n\nSignal recognition particle (SRP) is a ribonucleoprotein complex which mediates the targeting of nascent secretory (Walter and Blobel, 1980) , lysosomal (Erickson et al. 1983 ) and membrane proteins (Katz et al. 1977; Sakaguchi et al. 1984; Rottier, et al. 1985 Lipp and Dobberstein, 1986; ) to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (ER). The steps involved in this process have been elucidated using in vitro systems that faithfully reproduce the translocation of nascent proteins across membranes (Blobel and Dobberstein, 1975) . The steps can be described as follows (see Fig. I.) : Translation of mRNA coding for a secretory protein is initiated on free ribosomes in the cytoplasm (I).\n\nMost secretory proteins are synthesized with a Nterminal extension called a signal sequence. Upon emergence from the ribosome, this sequence is recognized by SRP (2). At this stage SRP can arrest or retarde (Walter and Blobel, 1981; Lipp et al., 1987) further elongation until contact is made with the receptor for SRP in the ER membrane, the docking protein (Meyer et al. 1982) or SRP receptor (Gilmore etal. 1982; Gilmore and Blobel, 1983) (3). Elongation resumes and the nascent chain is translocated across the membrane. On the luminal side of the msmbrane the signal sequence of most presecretory proteins is cleaved by signal peptidase (4). For further detail on the initial events of protein transport through the secretort pathway see recent reviews by Hortsch and Meyer (1986) and Walter and Lingappa (1986) . \n\nSRP is a small 11S cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein particle. It has been purified to homogeneity from a salt extract of dog pancreas rough microsomal vesicles (Walter and Blobel, 1980) . From wheat germ a SRP-like component has also been isolated and functionally characterized (Prehn et al. 1987) . When tested in a wheat germ cell-free translation system, SRP is required for translocation of newly synthesized proteins into salt-extracted microsomes. When analyzed by electron microscopy, SRP is an elongated rod-shaped particle, 5-6 nm wide and 23-24 nm long (Andrews et al. 1985) . SRP\n\nconsists of a 7SL RNA and six nonidentical polypeptide chains of 9, 14, 19, 54, 68, and 72 kDa (Walter and Blobel, 1980; Walter and Blobel, 1982) ( Fig. 2 ). Heterodimers are formed by the 9/14 and the 68/72 kDa proteins Scoulica et al., 1987) .\n\nfrans[afi on arresf domai n . The small stem-loops are formed by the 44 nucleotides at the 5\"end and the two larger ones by nucleotides 119 to 232 (see Fig. 2 ). The small stem-loops and most of the rod are foI~ned by the Alu segments, the larger loops by the central S segment (Zwieb, 1985) . (Fig. 2) . The large SRP subparticle containing the S segment can still promote translocation of secretory proteins across microsomal membranes, bu~ it does no longer cause an elongation arrest in the synthesis of presecretory proteins (Siegel and Walter, 1985) . These findings suggest that the Alu-like RNA in SRP and the 9/14 kDa proteins confer elongation-arresting activity to the particle (Siegel and Walter, 1986) (Fig. 2) .\n\nThis also shows, that the elongation arrest is not a prerequisite for protein translocation across the ER membrane (Siegel and Walter, ~985) .\n\nThe human genome is rich in sequences that are structurally related to the 7SL RNA. The 7SL gene family consists of four 7SL genes, 500 7SL pseudogenes that are truncated at one or both ends of the 7SL sequence and 500 OOOAlu sequences (Ullu and Weiner, 1984) . 7SL genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase III. The 7SL RNA promoter resides internal to the 5\"Alu-like part of the 7SL gene (Ullu and Weiner, 1985) . Ullu and Tschudi (1984) suggested that Alu sequences were derived from 7SL RNA by a deletiDn of the central 7SL-specific sequence.\n\nThe proteins in SRP are required for the membrane translocation activity of the particle, since alkylation with N-ethylmaleimide inactivates the particle (Walter and Blobel, 198~) . Similarly, antibodies against the 54, 68 and 72 kDa proteins have been shown to neutralize SRP activity in vitro (Walter and Blobel, ~983) .\n\nSRP can be disassembled into its native RNA and protein components by unfolding the particle with EDTA and separationo~ polycationic matrixes. Isolated SRP proteins are inactive in promoting translocation of secretory proteins across ER membranes.\n\nHowever, when combined with 7SL RNA in the presence of magnesium, the proteins associate stoichiometrically with 7SL RNA and form fully active SRP (Walter and Blobel, 7983) .\n\nSRP seems to interact via its 54 kDa polypeptide with the signal sequence of nascent polypeptides.\n\nUsing a photocrosslinking approach the signal sequence of nascent preprolactin was found to be bound to the 54 kDa SRP protein (Kurzchalia et al. 1986 , Krieg et al., 1986 ).\n\nThe domain structure of the SRP proteins has been investigated usingmild elastase treatment and protein-specific antibodies. A 55 kDa domain was cleaved from the 72 kDa protein and a 35 kDa domain from the 54 kDa protein and both were released from the particle. Release of these domains led to inactivation of the particle (Scoulica et al., 1987) .\n\nThe functions of SRP have up to now only been determined in cell-free systems. It was found, that SRP is required for the translocation of proteins across microsomal membranes and that SRP can arrest elongation of secretory proteins. The SRPmediated translation arrest has only been observed in a heterologous cell-free system containing components from plant and animal. No arrest could be found when homologous cell-free systems were used (Meyer, 1985) . It is conceivable that in the intact cell SRP retards rather than completely blocks the synthesis of presecretoryproteins. A biological function of such a mechanism could be a tight coupling of translation with membrane translocation (Walter and Blobel, 1981) . Another possible function for SRPmight be that it maintains the nascent polypeptide chain in a translocation competent form. Nascent polypeptides that remain translocation competent throughout their synthesis would not necessarily require SRP and DP. This indeed was found to be the case for certain small polypeptides that could be translocated across the ER membrane in the abesence of SRP and DP (Schlenstedt and Zi~ermann, 1987) ."}
