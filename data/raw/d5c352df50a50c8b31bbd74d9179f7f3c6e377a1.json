Within the endomembrane system are included the nuclear envelope, (NE), rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (rER, sER), the Golgi apparatus, and various transfer vesicles, as well as intermediate compartments that may arise under certain developmental conditions (e.g., annulate lamellae or other specialized cisternae). Plasma membrane, tonoplast, and lysosomes may be regarded as the system's end products, while the semiautonomous organelles, mitochondria, and plastids represent a separate category of membranous cell components. The concept of an endomembrane system is especially evident in tip-growing systems (fungal hyphae, pollen tubes, plant hairs, algal rhizoids, neuronal axons), where large amounts of cell surface materials are delivered via vesicles generated directly from cisternal membranes of the Golgi apparatus (Figs. 1, 2) .\n\nIt has long been considered that walls of cells that elongate by tip growth (Roelofsen, 1959) are derived in large measure from contents of secretory vesicles while the vesicle membranes form the new plasma membrane. Examples are pollen tubes (Rosen et al., 1964; Sassen, 1964; Larson, 1965; Rosen, 1968; VanDerWoude et al., 1971; Engels, 1974) , rhizoids (Sievers, 1965 (Sievers, , 1967 Rawlence and Taylor, 1972; Chen, 1973) , fungal hyphae (Girbardt, 1969; Bartnicki-Garcia, 1973) , neurons (Yamada et al., 1971; Lockerbie, 1987;  Heidemann, this volume, Chapter 11), and certain plant hairs (Sievers, 1963; Bonnett and Newcomb, 1966; Schr\u00f6ter and Sievers, 1971; Watson and Berlin, 1973) .\n\nAlthough arguments have been made from membrane recycling during tip growth Steer, 1981, 1983) , much of the membrane delivered to the expanding growth cone in the form of vesicles is actually required for the generation of the new membrane surface. The source of this new membrane is the ER-NE complex. Delivery to the Golgi apparatus is via 50-to 70-nm vesicles termed transition vesicles, that bleb from part-rough, part-smooth transitional regions of the ER or NE .

In this and other tip-growing cells, additions of Golgi apparatus-derived vesicles provide an important mechanism for surface growth. (From Morr\u00e9 and VanDerWoude, 1974.) 186 D.

Electron micrograph of a portion of a germinating tube of tobacco pollen illustrating the numerous dictyosomes (D) and rough elements of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that occur in the tube cytoplasm. Also present are rough-smooth ER transitions (large arrows) and small 50-to 70-nm transition vesicles (small arrows) thought to deliver membrane material to the Golgi apparatus from the ER. Also evident are numerous secretory vesicles in various stages of development containing electron-dense content with a filamentous or flocculent appearance. Bar, 0.5 \u03bc\u03c0\u03b9. (From Kappler et al, 1986.) transition vesicles dominates. However, in fungal hyphae, these vesicles may often be seen to derive directly from transitional regions of the NE (Bracker, 1967; Bracker et al, 1971; . This functional continuum of ER(NE) \u25a0> transition vesicle -> Golgi apparatus or Golgi apparatus equivalent -> secretory vesicle export route to the plasma membrane (lysosome/vacuole) and its role in surface generation in tip-growing cells is the subject of this chapter.\n\nA membrane biosynthetic function of the NE in tip growth is most evident only in certain fungi (Fig. 3B) , where some Golgi apparatus exhibit characteristic spatial relationships to the NE. Along these regions of Golgi apparatus-NE association, the outer leaflet of the NE is devoid of its characteristic ribosomes (becomes smooth) and nuclear pore structures are lacking. The smoothmembrane regions of the NE adjacent to Golgi apparatus are characterized by blebbing profiles that give rise to transition vesicles. These vesicles have a characteristic diameter of ~60 nm and are characterized by the presence of naplike coats. Their dominant function is thought to be to deliver new membrane materials to the Golgi apparatus. In Saprolegnia, Heath and Greenwood (1971) estimated that 80% of the dictyosomes were associated with ER whereas 4% were associated with the NE. The equivalence of NE and ER for membrane generation during tip growth is not unexpected in view of the nearly identical biochemical characteristics of the two different membrane systems (Franke, 1974) .\n\nDirect NE-ER connections also occur, especially in cells undergoing developmental change, but no special functions have been attributed to them.\n\nThe ER functions as the primary port of entry for both membrane and luminal proteins targeted not only to the plasma membrane (Morr\u00e9, 1975; Morr\u00e9 et al., 1979; Farquhar, 1981; Dunphy and Rothman, 1985; Wieland et al, 1987) but to the endosomal (lysosome/vacuole) system as well (Klausner, 1989) . The ER of plants consists of both lamellar (only rarely stacked) and tubular regions having a range of ribosomal densities ranging from densely covered to sparse (Fig. 2) .\n\nSmooth ER in plants is restricted to certain specialized glands. Most often smooth regions of ER, often anastomatic and tubular, exist interspersed in direct continuity with rER. Blebbing profiles indicative of transition vesicle formation most often are found associated with such part-rough, part-smooth transitional regions adjacent to Golgi apparatus (Fig. 3A) . Direct continuity between ER and Golgi apparatus via smooth tubular elements also has been suggested both for plants (Mollenhauer and Morr\u00e9, 1976a; Kristen, 1980) and animals Ovtracht, 1977, 1981) .\n\nEndoplasmic reticulum (together with the NE) in plants possesses the ability for synthesis of the basic proteins and lipids of membranes. In tip-growing pollen tubes, rapid pulse-chase kinetics were determined for leucine labeling of membrane proteins using ER fractions purified by preparative free-flow electrophoresis ( Fig. 4) (Kappler et al., 1986) . Results showed rapid incorporation of [ 3 H]leucine into ER followed by rapid chase out. The half-time for loss of radioactivity from the pollen tube ER was -10 min. The Golgi apparatus fraction was labeled differently, reaching a maximum at -20 min post-chase. The findings thus confirmed previous morphological suggestions for rapid flow of membranes from ER to Golgi apparatus during tip growth of pollen tubes.\n\nIn higher plants, the morphological basis for membrane transfer between ER and Golgi apparatus is not as clear as between ER and Golgi apparatus (Fig. 3A) , and NE and Golgi apparatus (Fig. 3B) in fungi, or between the ER and Golgi apparatus in animal cells. Yet, despite reports questioning their existence (Robinson, 1980; Kristen, 1982; Robinson and Kristen, 1982) , transition elements and vesicles do exist in plants as defined morphologically (Morr\u00e9 et al, 1984a) and functionally (Morr\u00e9 et al, 1989b) . Preparations enriched in transitional and endoplasmic reticulum and transition vesicles were isolated from soybean hypocotyl by free-flow electrophoresis, and these preparations transfer membrane proteins to Golgi apparatus acceptor fractions from both plant and animal sources (Morr\u00e9 et al., 1989b) . A possibility consistent with available evidence is that the vesicles derive from anastomotic smooth tubular regions of the ER (Fig. 3A ) in much the same manner as is observed in rat liver (Nowack et al., 1987) . In rat liver as in plants, regular and proximally aligned transitional cisternae are not evident as in some other tissues (Friend, 1965) .\n\nThe part-rough, part-smooth transitional regions of the ER have been prepared in enriched fractions both from rat liver Nowack et al., 1987) and from plant sources (Morr\u00e9 et al., 1989b) . The preparations from rat liver have biochemical properties (lipid and protein composition, marker enzymes) that are similar to those of the conventional rER (except for a lower TIME, MIN   Fig. 4 . Flow kinetics of an ER-enriched fraction from pollen tubes of tobacco germinated for 3 -4 hr and then pulsed for 7.5 min with 100 \u03bc \u03b8 [ 3 H]leucine followed by removal from the pulse medium by centrifugation and transfer to fresh medium containing excess unlabeled leucine. The results show rapid labeling followed by rapid charge out of radioactivity indicative of rapid turnover of ER membrane in these tip-growing cells. (From Kappler et al., 1986.) RNA/protein ratio) with which they exhibit structural continuity. When incubated with ATP and a cytosol fraction, the fractions respond by the production of 50-to 70-nm blebs and vesicles with characteristics of transition vesicles Nowack et al, 1987) .\n\nOnce assembled in the ER, the flow of membrane via the endomembrane system to the cell surface begins. The 50-to 70-nm vesicles that bleb from ER (or NE) to deliver new membrane to the forming regions of the Golgi apparatus represent the first major control point in the flow process. The vesicles are usually spherical, of very uniform diameter under given conditions of their formation, and are often observed to be coated by a naplike covering (Mollenhauer et al, 1976 ) that is distinct from the spiny clathrin coat of clathrincoated vesicles (Croze et al, 1982) and from the coats described for budding profiles associated by Orci and collaborators with trans Golgi apparatus transport (Orci et al, 1986; Melan\u00e7on et al, 1987; Malhotra et al, 1988) . While transition vesicles occur in plants and presumably function much as they do in animal cells, most of the information concerning their function has come from mammalian cells in culture or from rat liver.\n\nThe functional role of transition vesicles in transfer of membrane constituents from ER to Golgi apparatus with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-infected mammalian cells in culture has been studied using permeabilized-cell systems (Beckers et al, 1987; Balch and Beckers, 1988) and in cell-free systems involving Golgi apparatus membranes extracted from mitotic cells . In the viral model, the processing of the major G (glyco)protein of VSV was used as an index of transfer from ER to Golgi apparatus. The transfer step requires calcium, is blocked by low temperature, N-ethylmaleimide, and GTP-7-S, and requires ATP. Contents of the vesicle lumens also would be expected to be transferred, although there is no information on this point. At least in rat liver, major secretory proteins, the (very) low-density lipoproteins and albumin, appear to bypass the transition vesicles either partially or completely in reaching the Golgi apparatus (Morr\u00e9 and Ovtracht, 1981; Franz et al, 1981) .\n\nA defined cell-free system from rat liver has been described that reconstitutes the transition vesicle -\u00bb Golgi apparatus step using highly purified membrane constituents (Nowack et al, 1987; Paulik era/., 1988) . As with the permeabilized-cell system, transfer requires ATP and is blocked by Af-ethylmaleimide and low temperature as well as by CoCl 2 (Morr\u00e9 et al, 1989a; M. Paulik et al, unpublished observations) . Transition vesicles are isolated by preparative free-flow electrophoresis and then added to isolated Golgi apparatus. In the defined cell-free system, GTP-7-S prevents processing but not transition vesicle function or transfer, suggesting that the GTP-7-S sensitive site is involved in fusion of transition vesicles with eis Golgi apparatus rather than their formation from rER (M. Paulik et al, unpublished observations) .\n\nMembrane transfer between the ER and Golgi apparatus is blocked by temperatures of <16\u00b0C (sometimes <18\u00b0C) in both plants and animals. At temperatures of 16\u00b0C, transitional membranes accumulate near sites of transition vesicle formation in a special compartment designated as the 16\u00b0 compartment. Such a 16\u00b0 compartment between the ER and the Golgi apparatus was first reported for cultured cells infected with temperature-sensitive virus strains (Holmes et al, 1981; Saraste and Kuismanen, 1984; Tooze et al, 1984 Tooze et al, , 1988 . Reduced temperature has been shown to affect posttransitional processing and secretion in a number of systems as well. Tartakoff (1986) demonstrated that at 10\u00b0C secretory proteins of the exocrine pancreas accumulated in pre-Golgi apparatus transition vesicles while at temperatures of >22\u00b0C progress through the Golgi apparatus and into condensing vacuoles occurred. With hepatic cells, secretory proteins were blocked in a pre-Golgi apparatus compartment at 18\u00b0C, but at 20\u00b0C these proteins were exocytosed rapidly (Fries and Lindstrom, 1986) . This was similar to rat pancreas cells where at 16\u00b0C most of the labeled secretory proteins remained in the ER whereas at 20\u00b0C the medial Golgi region was reached (Saraste et al, 1986) .\n\nWith both liver and BHK cells when incubated at 16\u00b0C and at 18\u00b0C, transition vesicles accumulated (Morr\u00e9 et al., 1989a) . However, at <18\u00b0C there was also an accumulation of smooth tubular elements of the ER in the peripheral cytoplasm surrounding the Golgi apparatus in the proximity of the eis face. These structures may be structurally and functionally homologous to the 16\u00b0 compartment of virus-infected cells.\n\nLow temperature was one of the first treatments used to interfere with the secretory pathway in tip-growing cells (Schnepf, 1961; Sievers, 1963 ). An accumulation of transitional membranes was observed in corn root tips grown at 10\u00b0C (Mollenhauer et al., 1975 ; see also Morr\u00e9 et al., 1979) , not directly at the eis face but at the periphery of the stack in the position most often occupied by transitional ER in the plant. With pollen tubes, low temperature also blocked input into the Golgi apparatus more completely than exit of secretory vesicles, such that after several hours most dictyosomes are reduced to rudimentary stacks of one to two cisternae (W. J. VanDerWoude and D. J. Morr\u00e9, unpublished observations) . The 16\u00b0 block demonstrates membrane accumulations in an intermediate compartment between the ER and the Golgi apparatus and the subsequent resumption of transport on elevation of the temperature to 20\u00b0C. As such the observations provide a very clear morphological verification of membrane transfer between ER and Golgi apparatus in a variety of different cell types including plants.\n\nFew membrane systems within the cells exceed the Golgi apparatus in morphological complexity. It is, first of all, a transitional cell component exhibiting a functional (if not structural) continuity with the ER and several classes of vesicles and, through secretory vesicles or granules, with the plasma membrane (Fig. 5 ). There is also evidence from direct observations by light microscopy (Brown, 1969) , from labeling studies with radioactive precursors (Morr\u00e9 et al., 1979) , and from inhibitor studies (Mollenhauer and Morr\u00e9, 1976b; Picton and Steer, Fig. 5 . Comparison of membrane maturation (differentiation) (A) and vesicle shuttle (B) models of exocytosis and Golgi apparatus function. In the vesicle shuttle model, the cisternae of the Golgi apparatus would be considered as not turning over in their entirety. Rather, migration through the system would be accomplished by shuttle vesicles that would move materials from the ER to the Golgi apparatus and back and from one cisterna to the next (Rothman, 1981) . Vesicle membrane discharged to the plasma membrane would be returned by compensatory endocytosis. In the membrane maturation model, cisternae would be formed at the eis face by coalescence of transition vesicles derived from ER. The membranes would then be modified through processing and posttranslational insertion of new proteins at successive levels within the Golgi apparatus stack (Morr\u00e9 et al, 1979) . Eventually, the membrane would be discharged through formation of secretory vesicles and the ultimate release of a cisternal remnant. In this manner the entire Golgi apparatus would turn over with the buildup of a new cisterna at the eis face and the release of mature plasma membranelike units at the trans face. 1981; Kristen and Lockhausen, 1983; Morr\u00e9 et ai, 1983a ; Steer, this volume, Chapter 5) that the Golgi apparatus is a dynamic structure with a complete turnover in many cell types of its membrane constituents every 15-30 min. Furthermore, the entire structure is polarized (Mollenhauer and Morr\u00e9, 1966; Rothman, 1981; Pavelka, 1987) , with membranes resembling ER in their organization and biochemical makeup at one face and those resembling plasma membrane at the opposite face (Grove et al., 1968; Morr\u00e9 and Ovtracht, 1977) .\n\nThe stacks of cistemae composing the Golgi apparatus, also known as dictyosomes, most often exist side-by-side to form a complex ribbon adjacent to the nucleus in mammalian cells . In higher plants, fungi, and in some animal cells (e.g., invertebrates), the stacks or dictyosomes may be more widely separated to appear almost as discrete units within the cytoplasm. Generally, even in vertebrates, the dispersed arrangement is more characteristic of undifferentiated cells and tissues whereas the compact arrangement becomes more evident in cells specialized for secretion.\n\nWithin each Golgi apparatus stack or dictyosome there are normally 5 (3-7) cistemae (>20 in some algal and invertebrate cells) (Morr\u00e9, 1987) . Each cistema consists of a lumen or central cavity surrounded by a membrane. A flattened, central platelike region usually occupies the center and is what is most often referred to as the saccule. At the periphery of the saccule may be found fenestrae of -60 nm diameter. The fenestrated margins of the saccules are usually continuous with a system of tubules and vesicles that may extend for several microns from the edge of the saccule to connect with ER, lysosomes, or cistemae of adjacent dictyosomes at the same level in the stack. The existence of the cistemal tubules has been demonstrated by a variety of techniques both in vitro and in situ ( Fig. 1) (Tandler and Morr\u00e9, 1983) .\n\nGolgi apparatus cistemae at each level of the stack tend to exhibit unique characteristics in keeping with the dynamic nature of their functioning and the polarity across the functional axis. In most cells, one pole of each dictyosome is associated with the NE or ER in a very characteristic manner (Morr\u00e9 et al. y 1971) . This pole or face of the dictyosome (Golgi apparatus) is thus referred to as the pole proximal to ER (proximal pole), or eis face. This proximal pole or eis face of the Golgi apparatus is sometimes also referred to as the forming face.\n\nThe pole of the Golgi apparatus opposite to the association with ER or NE just described is the distal pole or trans face. This portion of the Golgi apparatus is characterized by the presence of mature secretory vesicles and a membrane morphology and composition resembling plasma membrane. This pole of the Golgi apparatus is also known as the mature, maturing, or secretory face.\n\nIntermediate cistemae between the proximal (eis) and distal (trans) poles are described as intercalary cistemae and have characteristics intermediate between those of the cistemae of the forming and mature faces. In addition to change from characteristics more closely resembling ER to characteristics more closely resembling plasma membrane, the differentiation of Golgi apparatus cisternae within the stack also involves various changes in the arrangements of saccules, tubules, and vesicles. Toward both poles, vesicles and tubules dominate, although different sorts of vesicles are involved and platelike or saccular regions may be present. Toward the center of the stack, the platelike or saccular regions are a dominant cisternal characteristic. Yet, even these cisternae have fenestrated borders and numerous tubules emanate from their peripheries (Morr\u00e9 and Ovtracht, 1981) .\n\nSurrounding the Golgi apparatus is a specialized region of the cytoplasm (zone of exclusion) that defines the Golgi apparatus zone. Endoplasmic reticulum entering the Golgi apparatus zone of exclusion usually lacks ribosomes. Mitochondria are excluded but microbodies and lysosomes may be present. Numerous free poly somes, so-called Golgi apparatus polyribosomes (Elder and Morr\u00e9, 1976) , are associated closely with but are not attached to the Golgi apparatus membranes within the Golgi apparatus zone. Here, too, are concentrated the 50to 70-nm small clathrin-coated vesicles associated dominantly with the mature face of the Golgi apparatus (Croze et al., 1982) .\n\nWithin each jlictyosome, cisternae are separated from one another by a space of 10-15 nm. Because the cisternal stacks can be isolated from the cell intact and subsequently unstacked by enzymatic and/or mechanical means (Morr\u00e9 et al., 1983b) , the intercistemal regions may represent a bonding region within the Golgi apparatus zone. In plant cells, a single layer of rodlike elements or fibers, the intercistemal elements, have been observed midway between the surfaces of adjacent cistemae within the intercistemal regions (Mollenhauer and Morr\u00e9, 1978 , and references therein). The intercistemal elements seem not to be associated with holding the cistemae together in the stack but rather in the control of cisternal and secretory vesicle shape. Plant cells show a consistent and marked narrowing of the cisternal lumens from the proximal to the distal pole in almost direct proportion to the number of intercistemal elements (Mollenhauer and Morr\u00e9, 1978) . Animals and fungi have Golgi apparatus that both lack the intercistemal elements and fail to reveal the marked gradient in cisternal narrowing.\n\nThe number of dictyosomes per cell ranges from none (in prokaryotes and certain fungi that lack dictyosomes but contain single cistemae that carry out Golgi apparatus functions = Golgi apparatus equivalents: Bracker, 1967) , to >25,000 in some algal rhizoids (Sievers, 1965) . A more typical plant or animal cell may contain several hundred dictyosomes (Mollenhauer and Morr\u00e9, 1966) .\n\nIf, as in a few algal cells, only one dictyosome is present, then this dictyosome is equivalent to the Golgi apparatus. While opinions may differ, multiple dictyosomes within a given cell function synchronously and appear sufficiently interconnected or interassociated in terms of their regulation to be regarded in totality as the Golgi apparatus. A single exception has been reported in Urodele sperm development by Werner (1970) , where more than one Golgi apparatus in a single cell has been indicated. However, in most current usage the totality of stacks or dictyosomes, whether one or numbering in the hundreds or thousands, is regarded as the Golgi apparatus.\n\nThe existence of a shuttle vesicle (Fig. 5B) to transfer materials from one Golgi apparatus compartment to the next was first postulated from the studies of Rothman and collaborators using the processing of VSV glycoproteins (VSG-G) as a model. They used a cell-free system that reconstituted protein transport between Golgi compartments. This complex reconstitution was first accomplished by Fries and Rothman (1980) . Since that time the system has developed considerably and has provided a conceptual basis for reconstruction of other transport events within the endomembrane systems.\n\nFries and Rothman employed a mutant BHK cell line that lacked a processing enzyme, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine N-acetylglucosamine: glycoprotein transferase, and was unable to process VSV-G. When homogenates of these cells in which the added viral proteins were marked by radiolabeling were mixed with homogenates of wild-type cells, processing of preformed VSV-G continued, suggestive of transfer from Golgi apparatus cisternae lacking the processing enzyme to Golgi apparatus cisternae containing the processing enzyme. The Golgi apparatus addition of the Af-acetylglucosamine was sensitive to Nethylmaleimide and inhibited by GTP-7-S. Coated buds associated with Golgi apparatus and sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide and GTP-7-S are distinct from transition vesicles (Orci et al., 1986 ). An Af-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor is involved in their formation (Malhotra et al., 1988) , and they accumulate on Golgi apparatus of cells treated with GTP-7-S (Melan\u00e7on et al., 1987) . Their existence as a free vesicle has not been documented, nor has it been possible to induce the formation of this type of vesicle in an isolated Golgi apparatus preparation. It has been difficult to study the steps involved in the liberation of the transport vesicles from the donor stack as well as the reactions that target those vesicles to their destinations as operationally isolated events. Either the targeting mechanism is extremely fast and efficient or the buds may not exist as free vesicles. The non-clathrin-coated buds have thus far been dissociated from the cisternal membranes of isolated Golgi apparatus only by treatment with high salt (Malhotra et al., 1989) .\n\nA trans Golgi apparatus network from animal cells has been described as a major sorting site especially in the discrimination of constituents destined for lysosome or for the cell surface (Griffiths and Simons, 1986) . Equivalent structures occur in plants including fungal hyphae and other tip-growing systems. They appear synonymous with the sloughed cisternae or cisternal remnant first described by Mollenhauer (1971) and later as a partially coated reticulum Lucas, 1984, 1985) . The formation of the latter has most recently been related to the Golgi apparatus cisternal remnant (Hillmer et al, 1988; Mollenhauer etal, 1989) .\n\nIn many tip-growing fungal hyphae, stacked cisternae of the conventional Golgi apparatus are entirely lacking. Here secretory vesicles may form directly from single cisternae of smooth membranes with a characteristic ring appearance (Fig. 6) . Electron microscope cytochemistry has revealed that these cisternae in hyphae of Allomyces javanicus, Hypomyces chlorinus, and Gilbertella persicaria contain the Golgi marker enzymes thiamin pyrophosphatase and inosine 5'-diphosphatase as well as polysaccharide components destined for the cell surface (Feeney and Treimer, 1979; Powell et al, 1981; Dargent et al, 1982) . These vesicle-forming transition elements were suggested early to function as Golgi apparatus equivalents (Bracker, 1967; Morr\u00e9 et al, 1971) . Thus the processing events necessary to convert unglycosylated proteins of the ER into the fully glycosylated plasma membrane forms, for example, may be accomplished entirely within the confines of a single cisterna (Sewall et al, 1989) . Additionally, one would assume that the entire series of events normally carried out by Golgi apparatus stacks as well is carried out without the involvement of any form of shuttle vesicle to mediate transport among adjacent Golgi apparatus compartments.\n\nLarge secretory vesicles that carry export products from the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface are of two general types. Both types, during their formation, are attached by means of one to several short tubules to the cisternal rims. In continuously secreting cells, the mature vesicles detach from the cisternae, often Fig. 6 . An example of a Golgi apparatus equivalent, the cisternal ring that serves as a Golgi apparatus in Gilbertella persicaria (Powell et al., 1982) . Secretory vesicles derived from these cisternae appear to deliver membrane and wall materials to the cell surface in much the same manner as for conventional Golgi apparatus (see text). Bar, 0.2 \u03bc\u03c0\u03b9. (Electron micrographs courtesy of Professor Charles Bracker, Purdue University.) accompanied by an association with clathrin-coated vesicles or clathrin-coated portions of the secretion vesicles and migrate directly to the cell surface where fusion of the vesicle membrane with the plasma membrane ensures delivery of secretory products to the pericellular space and delivery of new membrane to the plasma membrane. In intermittently secreting cells (e.g., acinar cells of the pancreas, chromaffin cells), secretory vesicles discharged from the mature Golgi apparatus face migrate to the cytoplasm where they function as condensing vacuoles and appear to collect and condense additional secretory products. The fully filled vacuoles, known as secretory granules, are then stored in the cytoplasm to await an appropriate signal to initiate their fusion with each other and with the plasma membrane. In tip-growing cells, secretory vesicles appear to be entirely of the continuously secreting type. Structures corresponding to condensing vacuoles appear not to accumulate.\n\nNot only do secretory vesicles of tip-growing cells deliver massive amounts of membrane to the cell surface, they are major sites of formation of the matrix polysaccharides of the cell wall. On the basis of cytochemical staining, the latter appear to be synthesized in large measure by enzymes associated with the vesicles in transit between the Golgi apparatus and the growing tip rather than by vesicles still attached to the Golgi apparatus stacks (VanDerWoude et al., 1971) . In pollen tubes of Easter lily, it has been calculated that, for each single cell, Golgi apparatus produce and export >1000 secretory vesicles per minute needed to generate 300 \u03bc\u03c0\u03b9 2 of new plasma membrane and attendant cell wall material per minute during pollen tube elongation (Morr\u00e9 and VanDerWoude, 1974) .\n\nPerhaps the single most important locus for control of passage of materials through the endomembrane system are the systems of vesicle locks that contribute to sorting and that control passage of materials from one endomembrane compartment to another. A system of sorting signals to control membrane traffic was postulated by Palade (1983) , in the form of different membrane receptors. If membranes \"act as their own templates by the interplay of specific signals and specific signal receptors,\" they will, as he suggests, recognize and incorporate appropriate components to grow by expansion in two dimensions. The elements of such a sorting and transfer system, however, are only now being described.\n\nIn each transfer step (ER to the Golgi apparatus, trans Golgi apparatus to the cell surface and, to the extent that such vesicular transfer occurs as discrete vesicle transfers, from one Golgi apparatus compartment to the next as well as possible recycling steps from the cell surface back to the Golgi apparatus and from the Golgi apparatus to the ER), the following control elements appear to be involved: sorting of materials to be transferred from donor compartment, vesicle formation from donor compartment, vectorial migration of donor vesicle to acceptor compartment, docking (recognition) of donor vesicle to acceptor compartment, and fusion of donor vesicle with acceptor compartment.\n\nInformation on these steps is most complete for the transfer from ER to eis Golgi apparatus, although subsequent evidence suggests many common factors for other transfer steps including those of endocytosis (Diaz et al., 1989) .\n\nMembrane-associated and secretory proteins may exit the ER at different rates (Lodish et al., 1983; Lodish, 1988) . Some proteins including soluble proteins enclosed within the lumen seem not to leave the ER at all. Three such resident proteins, the disulfide isomerase (Freedman, 1984; Edman et al., 1985) the glucose-regulated proteins grp78 (Munro and Pelham, 1986) , and grp94 (Kulomaa et al., 1986; Sorget and Pelham, 1987) , where the primary sequence is known, share a common KDEL (lysine-aspartic acid-glutamic acid-leucine) sequence at the N terminus that serves as a sorting signal to ensure retention in the ER (Munro and Pelham, 1987) . Attachment of this sequence to the C terminus of chicken lysozyme, a foreign secretory protein, conferred retention of the fusion protein in the ER (Munro and Pelham, 1987) . The C-terminal location of this retention signal was critical. Extension by additional random amino acids resulted in the proteins being secreted (Munro and Pelham, 1987) .\n\nA similar sequence, HDEL, was identified as a signal for protein retention in the ER of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting a similarity of signals to mammals. The yeast signal, however, was not an efficient retention signal when introduced into mammalian cells (Pelham et al., 1988) . Other examples also exist (Pa\u00e4bo et al., 1987) . The high-affinity auxin receptor is one example of a resident protein of the ER of higher plants where the KDEL sequence also is present at the N terminus (Inohara et al., 1989) . In contrast to retention, transfer is apparently the default pathway (Wieland et al., 1987; Niemann et al., 1988) .\n\nBoth ATP and guanosine nucleotides are required for vesicle formation from the donor compartment. A rate-limiting protein, presumably recycling back from the eis Golgi apparatus (Fig. 7) , is postulated as a major controlling element (Bourne, 1988) . This factor, designated \"X,\" would exchange bound GDP for bound GTP via an exchange protein (EP) of the transitional ER. In the GTP bound form, protein \"X\" would then combine with a recognition protein, \"Y\" on the transitional ER. Vesicle budding is then initiated in a process that is ATP dependent Balch et al., 1987; Beckers et al., 1987; Nowack et al., 1987) , modulated by retinol (D. D. Nowack, unpublished observations) but relatively insensitive to temperature. The Q 10 is approximately 2, as is characteristic of a metabolic process (Morr\u00e9 et al., 1989b) but is not completely blocked at 10\u00b0C, for example, as is vesicle transfer to the eis Golgi apparatus (S. Dunkle et al., unpublished observations) .\n\nA number of GTP-binding proteins have now been implicated in the exocytotic pathway. The YPT-1 gene product in yeast is a 23-kDa GTP-binding protein highly homologous to ras that functions early in the secretory pathway (Segev and Botstein, 1987) and that also has a mammalian homolog (Segev et al., 1988) . The yeast SEC-4-8 product essential for secretion and growth is a 23.5-kDa ras-related protein (Salminen and Novick, 1987) involved in later stages of secretion (Goud et al., 1988) . Bourne (1988) to explain how a G protein might direct membrane traffic in membrane flow and secretion. By analogy to the signal transduction pathway, a transport GTPase (X) would mediate formation and vectorial migration of vesicles from the transitional ER. As diagrammed, X G TP would recognize a protein constituent (Y) of the budding vesicles coming from the donor membrane. The XGTPY ternary complex on the vesicle surface then would specify attachment to a docking protein (Z) on the surface of an appropriate membrane acceptor (e.g., eis Golgi apparatus). Concomitant hydrolysis of GTP would release XGDP\u00bb leaving the vesicle-YZ complex to fuse with the acceptor membrane and X G DP to recycle back to form X G TP in a reaction catalyzed by a guanine nucleotide exchange protein (EP) located on the donor transitional ER membrane.\n\nWith transfer of secretory vesicles from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane, vectorial migration in animal cells (those where secretion is colchicine sensitive) is achieved by microtubules that serve as systems of guide elements to direct the vesicles to the cell surface (Derksen and Emons, this volume, Chapter 6). In most higher plants, vesicle migration is colchicine insensitive but sensitive to eytoehalasin B (Mollenhauer and Morr\u00e9, 1976b; Picton and Steer, 1981; Kristen and Lockhausen, 1983; Steer, this volume, Chapter 5) . Perhaps here microfilaments may serve a corresponding role as guide elements, but information is incomplete. Traffic between the transitional ER reticulum and the eis Golgi apparatus is both colchicine and eytoehalasin B insensitive, and no system of guide elements within the Golgi apparatus zone of exclusion has been identified.\n\nThe vesicle migration step between ER and the eis Golgi apparatus, both in vitro and in vivo, is completely blocked at temperatures of <16\u00b0C (Tartakoff, 1986; Morr\u00e9 et al., 1989b) . At these temperatures, transition vesicles accumulate as discrete vesicles. Also produced is the so-called 16\u00b0 compartment (see Section V). The function of the 16\u00b0 compartment may be tantamount to the coalescence of transition vesicles to form a cis Golgi apparatus compartment. Except for a slightly larger diameter, the transition vesicles that accumulate at low temperature appear normal and are apparently functional as they appear to migrate and fuse within minutes of raising the temperature to >20\u00b0C. A similar rapid recovery of the low-temperature (10\u00b0C) block of plant transitional ER was observed by Mollenhauer et al. (1975) . The basis for the temperature block is not understood but does provide a readily reversible means of interrupting the flow route at a point between transition formation and transfer to eis Golgi apparatus. Even here the formation step is self-regulating so that, unlike cytochalasinblocked migration of plant secretory vesicles (Mollenhauer and Morr\u00e9, 1976b) , the accumulation of transition vesicles does not continue beyond those formed within the first 10-30 min presumably as a result of the limitation imposed by the supply of some factor such as \"X,\" for example. This step also is blocked by CoCl 2 (Morr\u00e9 et al., 1989b) , as are the early steps of vesicle migration in axonal transport (Hammerschlag et al., 1976) .\n\nDocking of the donor transition vesicle is specific both in vivo and in vitro for eis Golgi apparatus membranes. In cell-free transfer experiments, efficient transfer is achieved only with eis Golgi apparatus as the acceptor compartment. 1 Also, transfer in the cell-free system shows saturation kinetics with respect to acceptor Golgi apparatus. That additional transfer can be initiated by addition of new acceptor membranes (D. D. Nowack, unpublished observations) would be suggestive of a finite number of available docking sites. Whereas the nature of the docking protein, designated \"Z\" in Fig. 6 , has not been determined, it is likely to be a highly conserved protein. In a cell-free system transition vesicles from plants will attach (\"dock\") to liver Golgi apparatus and liver transition vesicles will attach (\"dock\") to plant Golgi apparatus.\n\nThe final step in the transfer pathway involves coalescence of the docked vesicle with the eis Golgi apparatus membrane (fusion). This step is blocked by O s , intermediate, and trans Golgi apparatus fractions were purified from rat liver Golgi apparatus using a subfractionation method based on preparative free-flow electrophoresis (Morr\u00e9 et al., 1983b (Morr\u00e9 et al., , 1984b Navaseia/., 1986 ). GTP-7-S and therefore is likely to require GTP hydrolysis. As depicted in Fig. 6 , contact of the X-Y-vesicle-GTP complex with \"Z\" would initiate GTP hydrolysis. The hydrolysis of GRP might be the signal both for vesicle fusion and for release of \"X\" to initiate a new round of vesicle fusion. The fate of \" Y\" could be either transfer to the Golgi apparatus and eventually to the cell surface or recycling back to the ER from the eis Golgi apparatus compartment.\n\nEach transfer step in the secretory pathway is blocked by the sulfhydryl reagent Af-ethylmaleimide. A number of sulfhydryl reagent-sensitive proteins are likely to be involved. One such protein sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide that catalyzes the fusion of transport vesicles with Golgi cisternae in a mammalian cellfree system has been isolated and purified from the cytoplasm, where it exists as a tetramer of 76-kDa subunits Weidman et al., 1989) . This same protein is required for transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus in semiintact cells (Beckers et al., 1989) and for endocytic vesicle fusion in a cell-free assay (Diaz et al., 1989) . By cloning and sequencing the gene from Chinese hamster ovary cells, Wilson et al. (1989) report that this fusion protein is equivalent to the SEC 18 gene product of the yeast S. cerevisiae. The latter was previously shown to be essential for vesicle-mediated transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (Eakle et al., 1988 , and references therein).\n\nWhile considerable progress has been made concerning the molecular biology of vesicle formation by transitional ER and in the formation of the coated Golgi \"buds,\" much less is known about the formation of secretory vesicles by Golgi apparatus or of their fusion with the plasma membrane. Based on studies with the temperature-sensitive SEC4 mutant of yeast, it has been suggested that the SEC4 protein functions as a ras-related, GTP-binding protein on the surface of secretory vesicles to help target the vesicles from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane (Goud et al., 1988) .\n\nSome of the steps in the transport of Semliki Forest virus glycoproteins from the trans Golgi network to the plasma membrane have been reconstituted in mechanically permeabilized BHK cells (DeCurtis and Simons, 1988 ). In this system, transport from the Golgi apparatus was estimated from the proteolytic cleavage of the Semliki Forest virus PG2 glycoprotein into the E2 and E3 polypeptide chains. Appearance at the cell surface was estimated from the exposure of the exoplasmic domain of the viral glycoproteins to antibodies. Both the cleavage of the PG2 protein and the transport of the glycoprotein to the cell surface were reconstituted in the permeabilized BHK cells. Both calcium and glucose were required in the medium.\n\nThe fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane to release content and add new membrane to the cell surface has been extensively modeled in cellfree systems (Creutz et al., 1987) . The occurrences of these same events in secretory cells has been more difficult to establish, although considerable progress has been recorded, for example, with the Paramecium model (Plattner, 1987) . Earlier, Crabb and Jackson (1985) had reconstituted the process of secretory-vesicle exocytosis using purified cortical secretory vesicles and plasma membranes from sea urchin eggs. They attached the sea urchin eggs to poly ly sine-coated microscope slides and broke them open on this surface. The result was stable plasma membrane sheets with the appropriate cytoplasmic surface exposed for fusion of secretory granules. Exocytic fusion was monitored by quantitative phase-contrast microscopy, and was shown to be Ca 2 + dependent but did not require exogenous ATP. An ATP dependence of exocytosis was observed, however, in other permeabilized-cell models (Knight and Baker, 1982) .\n\nThe endomembrane system of tip-growing as well as other plant and animal cells consists of the ER (NE), Golgi apparatus, and various transport vesicles. Discrete transfer steps involving vesicles that form from donor to fuse with acceptor membranes between the ER and the Golgi apparatus and between the Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane provide for the orderly and regulated delivery of membrane materials and other products to the cell surface via a selective flow mechanism.\n\nIn the less than two decades since the endomembrane concept was first proposed and applied to understand the mechanism of cell surface increase in tip growth, considerable advances have been made relative to isolation of the individual compartments and subcompartments involved, the development of cellfree systems that reproduce individual transfer steps in vitro and the possibility, exemplified by the Af-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor, to isolate and clone individual functional and regulatory constituents. The opportunities afforded by these advances are now expected to mark the beginnings of yet an even more exciting new area, that of the molecular biology of endomembrane dynamics.\n\nThese events of membrane dynamics, once surrounded by much controversy, have now been reproduced in cell-free systems. They have become amenable not only to molecular dissection using molecular probes, but to both in vivo and in vitro confirmation as well.\n\nMajor questions remain concerning the relationships among the different compartments of the Golgi apparatus and the nature of the sorting signals that direct vesicular traffic. The population of vesicles that has been postulated to recycle between the Golgi apparatus and the ER remains to be identified either morphologically or biochemically. However, the rapid advances provided by the cellfree and molecular approaches currently under development can be reasonably expected to provide answers to these and other extant questions concerning the endomembrane pathway. Their application to tip-growing systems, for the most part, has yet to be realized, but as current limitations are lessened by new developments such applications are expected to follow and to increase considerably our understanding of how tubular cells grow at their tips."}
