{"title": "Real-time Estimates in Early Detection of SARS", "body": "We propose a Bayesian statistical framework for real-time inference on the temporal pattern of the reproduction number of an epidemic. Here, the reproduction number Rt for day t will be defined as the mean number of secondary cases infected by a case with symptom onset at day t. Denoting nt as the number of cases with symptom onset at day t and Xt as the number of secondary cases they infected, the reproduction number Rt is the ratio Xt/nt, defined for nt>0.\n\nAssume that we would like to compute the daily values Rt from day 0 to present day T, before the epidemic has ended. Although daily incident case counts can be known up to day T, provided no delay in reporting occurs, the corresponding counts of secondary cases Xt cannot. Secondary case-patients infected before day T, whose illness had a long incubation time, may have clinical onset only after day T. Furthermore, since the exact chain of transmission is seldom observed in practice, attributing secondary cases to previous cases is difficult. Focusing on these 2 issues, we show that the daily counts of symptom onset available until day T are sufficient to estimate Rt.\n\nA 3-step construct is necessary. We first predict the eventual number of late secondary cases (as yet unobserved), for cases reported at day t, assuming the number of early secondary cases (reported before day T) is known. The method described by Wallinga and Teunis (2) is then used to estimate the number of early secondary cases from the daily counts of symptom onsets. These 2 steps are finally combined and yield an estimate of the predictive distribution of Rt. Technical details are given in the Appendix. The estimation procedure depends on 3 assumptions: 1) ascertainment of patients whose symptoms appear before day T is complete, 2) transmission events are independent, and 3) the generation interval, the time from symptom onset in a primary case to symptom onset in a secondary case, has a known frequency distribution.\n\nThe method was retrospectively used to analyze the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong. The data consisted of the dates of symptom onset of the 1,755 case-patients who were detected in Hong Kong in 2003 (4).\n\nUsing simulations, we explored the ability of the method to quickly detect the effect of control measures. Five hundred epidemics were simulated with the following characteristics. During the first 20 days of the epidemics, the theoretical reproduction number was 3. Control measures were implemented at day 20. In a first scenario, control measures were completely effective (no transmission occurred after day 20). In a second scenario, the theoretical reproduction number after control measures were implemented was 0.7. Details on the simulations are available from the corresponding author.\n\nIn a simulation study, the bias and precision of the real-time estimator were investigated in situations in which the theoretical reproduction number remained constant with time. We also evaluated the effect of the length of the generation interval on the results. Detailed information can be obtained from the corresponding author.\n\nFigure 1A shows the dates of symptom onset of the 1,755 SARS patients detected in Hong Kong in 2003. Figure 1B\u2013F shows the expectation and 95% credible intervals of the predictive distribution of Rt based on data available at the end of the epidemic and after a lag of 2, 5, 10, and 20 days.\n\nAfter a lag of 2 days, the 95% credible intervals were wide and displayed an undesirable feature: they sharply decreased to 0 as soon as no cases had been observed for 2 consecutive days (Figure 1C; note especially days 1\u20134 and 13). After a 5-day lag, this undesirable feature had vanished (Figure 1D).\n\nWith lags >5 days, the trends of expected values were relatively similar, with a peak around day 20, a decreasing trend after this date, and the expectation of Rt decreasing to <1 around day 40. These observations suggest that after a lag of only 5 days, the temporal trends in the expectation of Rt are well captured. For a lag of 5 days, the credible interval of Rt was wide when <20 cases were detected (periods 0<t<20 and t>63), but was relatively narrow when more cases were detected (period 21<t<62). As expected, the width of the credible interval narrowed as the lag increased and more complete data were available. The expectations and credible intervals were very similar for lags of 10 and 20 days, 67.8th and 99.7th percentiles, respectively, of the distribution of the SARS generation interval described by Lipsitch et al. (3). No difference was detected between retrospective and 20-day estimates.\n\nIn Figure 2, the method is used to estimate the impact of control measures implemented on day 20 in the simulated datasets with completely effective or limited control measures. The curves show the temporal pattern of Rt based on an average over the 500 simulated datasets as a function of T. Even when control measures are completely effective, based on data available up to day 21, the average expectation of R20 is \u22483. Based on data available up to day 25, a downward trend is apparent, whereas based on data available up to day 29, the average expectation of Rt is <1 from t = 27 days. Based on data available up to day 40 (20 days after the implementation of the control measures), the estimates indicate that the threshold value 1 is crossed at day 22, which is 2 days after control measures were implemented. With limited control measures, the observed changes are qualitatively the same, although slightly more time is required for Rt estimates to decrease to <1.\n\nOur statistical framework provided real-time estimates of the reproduction number of an epidemic, and thus quickly showed the impact of control measures. In simulations of SARS-like diseases, the derived estimator detected the decrease of Rt only 5 days after control measures were implemented. Furthermore, the average estimate had crossed the threshold value of 1 only 9 days after control measures were implemented.\n\nIn theory, the method could be applied to communicable diseases with the following characteristics: 1) no asymptomatic cases; 2) no underreporting; 3) knowledge of the generation interval. The list of communicable diseases that could be monitored is therefore relatively large, although it does not include diseases such as influenza, for which the proportion of asymptomatic or unreported cases may be large. In practice, the delay until estimates of the reproduction number become reliable will depend critically on the generation interval distribution. For SARS, when the reproduction number was constant over time, our real-time estimates were almost unbiased after only 1 day. With the original estimator of Wallinga and Teunis (2), which is not intended for real-time estimation, downward bias would be a concern for at least 2 weeks after observation. However, real-time estimates obtained for recent days displayed wide 95% credible intervals and zero-width intervals when no cases had been observed or reported for a few days. Here, owing to the relatively short generation interval of SARS (mean 8.4 days) (3), reliable estimates were obtained after only 5 days, albeit with wide credible intervals, and they were consolidated after 10 days. These lags corresponded to the 20th and 70th percentiles of the SARS generation interval (3). When the generation interval doubled, the time delay required to detect the effect of control measures implementation or to consolidate estimates roughly doubled.\n\nWe assumed that the distribution of the generation interval was known and remained unchanged during the course of the outbreak. In practice, however, this distribution is derived from a subset of traced cases. If the subset is small, e.g., the case at the beginning of an emerging disease outbreak, uncertainty will be large. Furthermore, the generation interval may decrease during the course of the outbreak because of quicker interventions, leading to possible bias in the estimates of R (2). Further developments of the method could take these issues into consideration. For example, one could use information on traced cases as it accrues to sequentially estimate the generation interval. Depending on how cases are traced during the epidemic, changes in the generation interval could also be monitored.\n\nThe approach smoothed the temporal pattern of the reproduction number, leading to overestimation of R in the week after control measures were implemented. We are trying to find a correction factor for this bias in ongoing research.\n\nThe method has a natural real-time implementation in which 1) a first estimate of the reproduction number is available after a lag that depends on the generation interval, and 2) while the epidemic goes on, the estimate is consolidated, and its credible interval narrows. Incorporation of such a statistical estimation framework into real-time surveillance of future infectious disease outbreaks would enhance the ability of epidemiologists to provide timely advice to public health policymakers.\n\nDenoting nt the number of cases with onset at day t and Xt the number of cases they infected, the reproduction number Rt is simply the ratio Xt /nt defined for nt>0. Here, we define a method to obtain the predictive distribution of Rt given the available data at day T, where data I(T) = {nt}0< t <T are the daily counts of incident onsets, assuming that the density w(.) of the generation interval is known. We will make use of the decomposition Xt = Xt-(T) + Xt+(T), where the number of secondary cases Xt from cases with onset at day t has been split in those with onset before T (Xt-(T)) (early secondary cases), and those with onset after T (Xt+(T)) (late secondary cases).\n\nThe construction of a global estimator is carried out in 3 stages. First, we consider the problem of right censoring, under the assumption that the exact chain of transmission has been observed until day T. In this situation, Xt-(T) is observed while Xt+(T) is censored and must be predicted, conditional on Xt-(T) and nt, to allow computation of the predictive distribution of Rt. Second, when the exact chain of transmission has not been observed, the number of early secondary cases, Xt-(T), is not available. Following the recommendations of Wallinga and Teunis (1), we show that it is possible to compute the distribution of Xt-(T) given I(T). Finally, the conditional distributions of Xt+(T) given Xt-(T), nt and Xt-(T) given I(T) are combined to derive the distribution of the reproduction number Rt conditional on I(T). All distributions presented are conditional to the number nt of symptom onsets at day t, but notation is omitted for the sake of clarity.\n\nWe assume that Xt is Poisson distributed with mean nt \u03bbt and choose a vague gamma prior distribution for \u03bbt with shape parameter \u03b1 = 10-5 and rate \u03b2 = 10-5.\n\nConditional on Xt, the number Xt-(T) of early secondary cases is binomial with parameters Xt, WtT, where WtT is the probability that the generation interval is <T \u2013 t. It follows that Xt-(T) | \u03bbt is Poisson distributed with mean nt \u03bbt WtT. The same argument would show that Xt+(T) | \u03bbt is Poisson with mean nt \u03bbt (1 \u2013 WtT). Given \u03bbt, Xt+(T) and Xt-(T) are independent so thatWith Bayes' theorem,whereEventually, we obtain that the distribution Xt+(T) | Xt-(T) = y is negative binomial with parameters p = (ntWtT + \u03b2)/(nt + \u03b2), m = y + \u03b1 and probability\n\nIn practice, the exact realization of Xt-(T) is unknown, and inference must be based on I(T) alone. Wallinga and Teunis (5) have shown that the probability that a case detected at day k<T has been infected by a case detected at day t<T iswhere 1{.} is the indicator function. The distribution of Xt-(T) given I(T) is a sum of independent binomial distributionsXt-(T) | I(T) ~ \u2211k <T Bin(nk,ptk)This probability distribution may be determined numerically.\n\nUsing the decomposition in early and late secondary cases, we obtainAfter calculation, we find that the expectation and variance of Xt | I(T) are functions of the expectation and variance of Xt-(T) | I(T) alone, derived with the method of Wallinga and Teunis:\nFor the vague prior we specified for \u03bbt, we obtain\n\nAs expected, the average proportion of secondary cases detected before T is WtT. The first term of the variance is related to our imperfect knowledge of the realization of Xt-(T) while the second term is related to the natural randomness of Xt+(T). We stress that when the lag between day t and day T is large (i.e., WtT \u22481), our estimates are similar to those of Wallinga and Teunis for complete epidemics.\n\nGiven Xt | I(T), the derivation of the predictive distribution of the reproduction number Rt is straightforward considering the deterministic relation Rt = Xt/nt."}
