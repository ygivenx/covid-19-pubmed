{"title": "Novel Coronaviruses and Astroviruses in Bats *", "body": "The expanding human population has shaped the emergence of infectious diseases in human or poultry by sustaining disease transmission with extremely high population density that did not exist anywhere in the world before (6, 28) . Previous analysis has also shown that more than 70% of emerging or reemerging pathogens are known to be zoonotic (29) , and many of these emerging infections are associated with wildlife (4) . These observations suggested that human encroachment on wildlife habitats has caused the exposure of previously unknown pathogens in wild animals and An explanation for this is that RNA viruses might have much higher nucleotide mutation rates than those pathogens that have a DNA genome, thereby allowing the RNA viruses to better adapt to a new host (7) .\n\nMany emerging pathogens of human, domestic animals are assumed to be maintained in wildlife.\n\nHowever, many of these reservoirs for emerging viruses have never been identified. These perhaps (19) . In human, astroviruses are the second or third most common viral agent found in children with diarrhea (5, 14) , and these viruses can also cause significant diseases in elderly (17) and in immunocompromised patients (9) . The prevalence of astroviruses in different species of apparently healthy\n\nMiniopterus bats roosting at a single cave in Hong Kong ranges from 36% to 100% throughout a year.\n\nThis suggested that these astroviruses might persistently infect the same bat population. Interestingly, the genetic diversity of these viruses at a single habitat 102 Virol. Sin. (2009) 24: 100-104 was found to be greater than the one for all the previously known mamastroviruses. More importantly, some bat astroviruses were found to be genetically closely related to human astroviruses, suggesting these bat and human viruses might share the same ancestor.\n\nA similar high prevalence of genetically diversified astroviruses has also been detected in bats captured from different part of China (unpublished data).\n\nBased on a phylogenetic analysis on viral RdRp gene, astroviruses detected from two different host species (Miniopterus magnater and Miniopterus pusillus) were found to be clustered together, suggesting some of these bat astroviruses are more ready to cause zoonotic transmission. This observation is notably different from that observed from bat coronaviruses (2, 3) . With these findings, it is tempting to speculate that some of these bat astroviruses might have a great zoonotic potential. Further investigations of bat astroviruses might provide new insights into the ecology and evolution of astroviruses.\n\nThe majority of previous studies of coronaviruses and astroviruses were limited to the detection of viruses in clinical and veterinary samples. In particular for astrovirus, genetic information was based on short fragments of viral DNA amplified by reverse transcription-PCR (12, 21) . With the discovery of these novel coronaviruses and astroviruses in bats, unprecedented information about these two viral families can be generated. The availability of the genetic information enables us to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships and selection pressure and recombination events in these viruses. The information also helps the development of better detection methods for possible unknown coronaviruses and astroviruses which may cause diseases in livestock or in human.\n\nThese results might also help to identify crucial viral features which might be useful for novel drug designs.\n\nMore importantly, the discoveries of these novel bat viruses highlighted the role of bats as the major reservoirs of emerging viruses with zoonotic potential.\n\nAs efficiency disease control must be directed at the reservoir (13), surveillance for unknown pathogens in wildlife is a step needed to be taken for our better preparedness for future zoonotic diseases."}
