{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Treatment with convalescent plasma for critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection Treatment with convalescent plasma for critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection", "body": "Since late December 2019, an outbreak of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection first appeared in Wuhan, China (1) , and rapidly spread to 171 countries. As of March 24, 2020, the virus has been responsible for 379,661 confirmed cases and 16,428 deaths worldwide. To date, no specific treatment was recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection except for meticulous supportive care (2) . Numerous therapeutics were explored or developed during the outbreak. A recent trial showed lopinavir-ritonavir has no treatment benefit for severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 (3). Immunotherapy with virus-specific antibodies in convalescent plasma had been used as a last resort to improve survival rate of patients with serious infectious diseases, such as SARS, middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Ebola virus disease, pandemic influenza A, and avian-origin influenza A (4) . Previous reports showed treatment with convalescent plasma collated from recovered patients could reduce the hospital stay and mortality of patients (5) . However, the efficacy of convalescent plasma in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear.\n\nHerein, we reported the disease course on four critically ill SARS-CoV-2-infected patients treated with supportive care and convalescent plasma. Figure 1 showed the clinical course of the four critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Our first case was a 69-year-old female with a history of hypertension who 3 presented with fever for two days and clear sputum for four days. On January 30, the patient was admitted to Dongguan Ninth People's Hospital because of positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test of throat swab by Dongguan Center for Disease Control (CDC). A chest CT revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities primarily distributed along the pleura. Treatment with arbidol (200 mg three times daily), lopinavir-ritonavir (400 mg twice daily), interferon alpha inhalation (50 \u03bcg twice daily), and other supportive therapies was started. At 4 p.m. on February 4, the patient's oxygen pressure (pO2) decreased to 56.5 mmHg with OI of 94 mmHg. Significantly increased consolidation was observed in the right lung. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Dongguan People's Hospital (a designated center for critically illness treatment) on February 5 and received invasive mechanical ventilation.\n\nApart from antiviral drugs (lopinavir-ritonavir, oseltamivir, and interferon alpha), human albumin, zadaxin and immunoglobulin, antibacterial and antifungal drugs were administrated because of co-infection with bacteria and aspergillus. At 6:30 p.m. on showed that 5% of the cases were critically illness characterized by respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure. Around 48% of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients had comorbid conditions, commonly cardiovascular diseases and diabetes (9) . Elderly people with underlying diseases were more likely to have higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and higher risk of death. The Convalescent plasma had been used as a last resort to improve survival rate of patients with SARS-infection. Previous evidences proved that convalescent plasma treatment can significant reduce the relative risk of mortality of patients (13) , which might because that antibodies from convalescent plasma might suppress viraemia. The level of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in donor plasma could be important for the 8 effectiveness of intervention. However, the level of neutralizing antibodies in donor plasma before transfusion cannot be determined. In this study, three patients were tested either virus load or antibodies IgM and IgG. In the first case, SARS-CoV-2 virus load after convalescent plasma transfusion significantly dropped (from 55 \u00d7 10 5 to 3.9 \u00d7 10 4 to 180 copies per milliliter). Among the four patients, the time from the transfusion to negative RT-PCR test results ranged from 3 to 22 days. The third and fourth cases produced anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG approximately 14 days after convalescent plasma transfusion. Patients who survived critically ill diseases might mount higher antibody responses, which can persist for longer periods as compared with those with non-severe disease (14) . The antibody levels, however, were confounded by other treatments, such as antiviral drugs, steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (15) . A recent animal model indicated that antibodies produced from SARS-CoV-2 infection could protect from subsequent exposures (16) .\n\nOur results indicated convalescent plasma might be a potential therapy for critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. We observed no serious adverse reactions associated with the transfusion of convalescent plasma. However, the relative contributions of supportive care, investigational therapies, and patient's immune-response on survival could not be determined. Whether convalescent plasma and/or supportive care provide any clinical benefit is unknown. The safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma transfusion in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients should be studied within the context of a well-designed clinical trial. "}
