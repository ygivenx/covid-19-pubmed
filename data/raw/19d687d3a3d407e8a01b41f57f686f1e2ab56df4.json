{"title": "", "body": "T he Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS), a 5-level system, recently has emerged as a more sensitive, accurate, and reliable tool for rapid patient assessment. 1 CTAS training was originally developed as a 1-day workshop, offered periodically at various sites.\n\nOne of the problems with this approach was that managers had problems releasing staff to attend the traditional 1-day CTAS workshop, and it placed major travel and time demands on the limited pool of qualified CTAS trainers. 2 To improve access and to standardize CTAS training, The Change Foundation, a branch of the Ontario Hospital Association, worked with a local community partner, Centennial College, to develop the CTAS workshop as a Web-based course.\n\nOur CTAS online course development team consisted of an ED manager who had developed the workshop CTAS course, an ED nurse/faculty member, a nurse E-learning evaluator and online learning team manager from the community partner, Centennial College. The Change Foundation provided funding for the team's release time. It took approximately 44 days for course development and 12 days to evaluate the course.\n\nWe started by identifying nurses' training and technology needs, learning and work environments, and learning styles. We learned that nurses want quick, convenient access to current information and that they learn effectively when they can discuss real-life situations. Accordingly, we developed the course with the following features: Information (presented as text and graphics) on the 5 CTAS levels, course modules, interactive case Preparing ED Nurses to Use the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale With Web-based Learning\n\nstudies, an online discussion area, an online tutorial, and a workplace project. The course took 6 weeks to complete, and participants typically spent about 4 hours a week online. The cost of the course was paid for by the nurses' hospitals.\n\nA week in the life of the online learner Nurses logged on to the course at home or at work, at whatever time was convenient to them. They read the current module content, practiced working through case studies, and sent answers to their teacher. Equally important, nurses provided the rationale for why they had triaged a patient at a particular level in the online discussion and engaged in discussion with their colleagues.\n\nNurses were surveyed and interviewed after completing the course. Nurses who used a computer at home to take the course liked the convenience of online learning. Nurses who used a computer at work to take the course had difficulty finding computers they could use that had Internet access. The biggest challenge, however, was time. Some nurses were able to do coursework at night during ''down times'' at work, but this was not a common experience.\n\nFor 75% of the nurses interviewed, the CTAS course was the first course they had taken online, and they faced a steep technology learning curve at the start. The nurses persevered; the majority reported that they learned CTAS well and that their triaging skills were more accurate and consistent. One nurse commented, ''It's made me change my whole approach. I think I'm more efficient and thorough with my assessments.'' Another remarked, ''Last night someone had something in his eye, a couple of babies came in, and a respiratory problem came in. They all arrived at the same time. Having a rationale now for prioritizing the patient makes things easier.'' When in doubt about a patient's status, they were ''triaging up,'' that is, erring on the side of patient safety. Nurses reported that the online discussion area provided them with an opportunity to really explore the rationale for assigning patients to a particular triage level. The forum also gave nurses the opportunity to hear about other nurses' experiences and to network, sometimes with nurses working in hospitals more than 3000 miles away.\n\nNot all nurses reported a positive experience. Nurses who already were familiar with CTAS or had extensive ED experience reported that they wished there had been more content and more complex case studies for review. Based on feedback from the nurses, we went back to the drawing board, refined the online course, and made a number of changes, including the following:\n\nAdding more in-depth content to provide a challenge for experienced triage nurses Adapting content to make it applicable for paramedics working on triage Expanding the pediatric module to include pediatric CTAS guidelines recently developed by the National Triage Working Group (which supports triage standards development and implementation) New content on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and West Nile Virus Guidelines for implementing CTAS in rural areas We found that keeping an online course current and responsive to the learners' needs means regularly seeking learner feedback and acting on it promptly. We have learned a lot and plan to develop a Web-based course on Pediatric CTAS and a CTAS refresher course that nurses and paramedics can access on a yearly basis for ongoing learning and review. The online CTAS course is a 5-week course with a final examination in the sixth week. It is offered 5 times a year, in January, March, May, September, and November."}
