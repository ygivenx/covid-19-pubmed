{"title": "PHYSICO-CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF CALl! ~:,IARRHEA CORONAVIRUS", "body": "Calf diarrhea coronavirus was recently recovered from the feces of calves with neonatal diarrhea and proved to be a causative agent of the disease (Stair et ah, 1972; Mebus et al., 1972, 1973 a and b; Sharpee et al., 1976) . The virus multiplied in bovine embryonic kidney cell cultures, but failed to induce readily recognizable cytopathic effect . Recently we have obserced that the virus readily replicates and induces a marked I cytopathic effect in cultures of a continuous cell line, BEK-1, derived frovll bovine embryonic kidney. This observation has provided a sensitive, practical assay method (Inaba et al., 1976) , whereby the virus and its disease can now be studied more systematically. The present study was undertaken to learn some of the physico-chemica] properties of the virus.\n\nCell cultures. --BEK-1 cells were grown as described previously (lnaba et al., 1976) . The growth medium used was Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 10% tryptose phosphate broth (TPB), 10% calf serum and antibiotics~ and the maintenance medium was MEM containing 10% TPB, 0.05% yeast extract, 0.5% sodium glutamate, 0.7t% glucose and antibiotics.\n\nViruses. --The calf diarrhea coronavirus , passaged in cultures of bovine embryonic kidney cells, was kindly supplied by Dr C.A. Mebus, University of Nebraska. The virus was passaged twice in calf kidney cell cultures and five times in BEK-1 cell cultures in our laboratory (Inaba et al., 1976) before use in the present study. Strain BF!I of bovine enterovirus (BE virus) (Inaba et al., 1962) and st, rain Los Angeles of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) virus were also used for comparison. All these viruses were grown in BEK-1 cell cultures and the supematant fluid o~ infected cul. tures was used as seed virus in the present study.\n\nInfectivity assay. --Serial dilutions of the viral mate]Sal were made with maintenance medium and each dilution was inoculated in 0.1-ml amounts into three tubes of BEK-1 cell culture. After virus adsorption at 37 \u00b0 C for I h, the inoculated cultures had 0.5-ml amounts of malntec~ance medium added and were then incubated at 34*C in a roller drum for ~i days. The titer was expressed in 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCIDs0) per 0.1 ml.\n\nHemagglutination (HA). --HA titer was measured by the method described previously (Sato et al., 1977) and was expressed as the reciprocal of the highest antigen dilution which showed complete hem~,~glutination.\n\nEffect of 5-iodo-2'.deoxy ~. ri~:.?#ze (IUDR) Calf diarrhea coronav~r~ls was tested along with IBR and BE viruses. A group of tube cultures of ~;EK-1 cells were inoculated with virus at an input multiplicity of 0.1 TCID~ ~}ceU. After virus adsorption at 37 \u00b0 C for I h, ~me half of the inoculated cultures received 0.5-ml amounts of maintenance medium and the remaining half received maintenance medium containing 50 ~g/ml of IUDR. The cultures were incubated in a roller drum at; 34 \u00b0 C, and, at intervals, four cultures were taken f~t a each group. The fluid phase of the cultures was pooled and stored at -SjOC after clarification by tow-speed centrifugation. All the specimens were assayed for infectivity ~imultaneously. The results are illustrated in Fig. 1 . The replication of calf diarrhea coronavirus was not affected by IUDR, indicating that the virus is an RNA virus. The control viruses employed behaved as expected; BE viras was not affected by IUDR, but IBR virus did not multiply in the presence of IUDR. \n\nIn a test tube fitted with a robber stopper 1.6 ml of infectious culture fluid and OA m! of anesthetic ether were mixed, kept at room temperature for I h, and centrifuged to separate the water phase, which was used for infectivity assay after evaporation of the residual ether under reduced pressure. ~e treatment with chloroform was carried out by mixing 1.9 ml of infectious culture fluid and 0.1 ml of chloroform. The mixture was kept at room temperature for 1 h, centrifuged~ and the resulting wate~ phase was used for infectivity assay. As shown in Table I , calf diarrhea coronavirus was sensitive to ether and chloroform. Of the viruses used as controls, IBR virus was completely inactivated but BE virus was resistant to these treatments.\n\nOne milliliter of infectious culture fluid and I ml of 0.2% DOC in PBS were mixed and the mixtures were kept at room temperature for 1 h and assayed for infectivity. As shown in Table I , calf diarrhea coronavims was completely inactivated by DOC. IBR virus was also inactivated by DOC, but BE virus was not.\n\nOne milliliter of infectious culture fluid, diluted ten-fold with distilled water, was mixed with I ml of 2.0 M MgC12 solution, the maintenance medium or distilled water, and the mixtures were incubated in a water bath at 50\u00b0C for I h and assayed for infectiviW. As shown in Table II , calf diarrhea coronavirus, like BE virus, was stabilized by M MgCI2, but readily inactivated in diluted medium at 50\u00b0C within 1 h, while IBR virus in diluted medium was as stable as in the maintenance medium but was rapidly (within 1 h) inactivated in M MgCI2 solution.\n\nTwo tenths of a milliliter of infectious culture fluid and 1.8 ml of McIlvain's buffer solutions at pH 3.0, 5.0 or 7.0, or PBS (pH 7.2) were mixed in test tubes fitted with rubber stoppers. The mixtures were incubated at room temperature (22\u00b0C) for I h and assayed for infectivity. At pH 3 a slight loss of infectivity was shown, while at pH 5 and 7 no loss in infectivity was shown (Table III) . \n\nOne milliliter of infectious culture fluid and I ml c~ 2, I, 0.5 or 0.25% trypsin ~olution (Difco, 1 : 250) in PBS (0.8% NaCI, M/150 phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) were mixed. The mixtures were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h and assayed for infectivity after addition of 2 ml of trypsin inhibitor solution (1 mg/ml). As shown in Table IV , calf diarrhea coronavirus was sensitive to trypsin but somewhat less sensitive than IBR virus, whereas BE virus was res~stan~ to trypsin.\n\nThe virus was readily filtered through Sartorius membrane filters uf 200 and 100-nm pore sizes, but not through 50-nm filters (Table V) .\n\nInfectious culture fluid was centrifuged at 3 000 Ilam for 30 rain to remove coarse debris and virus was sedimented by centrifugation at 100 000 \u00d7 g for 2 h, and resuspended in 0.01 volume of PBS. The resulting virus suspension was mixed with a CsCI solution to a density, of 1.25 g/ml and centrifuged in a Spinco SW 50.1 rotor at 300 000 X g for 20 h, Fractions were obtained by puncturing the tube bottom, and assayed for infectivity and hemagglutinin (Fig. 2) . Infectivity showed a peak which coincided in position with the peak of hemagglutinin. The density of the peak fractions was estimated to be 1.24 g/ml. Electron microscopic examination of these peak fractions by the phosphotungstic negative staining technique revealed numerous spherical virions. Although most particlcs were more or less damaged, they were shown to have an envelope covered with widely spaced club-shaped projections about 20 nm long (Fig.3) . The size of the virions ranged from 110 to 160 nm, the average diameter including surface projections was estimated to be about 130 nm.\n\nThe present knowledge concerning the basic properties of calf diarrhea coronavixus is limited. The results presented in this ~port contribute some information on the physical and chemical properties of \",he virus, and support 79 . ). This finding should be further confirmed and extended by direct extraction and analysis of the nucleic acid from highly purified virions, including determination of whether it is single or double stranded.\n\nSensitivity to lipid solvents, ether and chloroform, indicates that the virus is enveloped, confirming the electron microscopic observation of the virion reported in this paper and by previous workers Sharpee et al., 1976) . The virus was readily inactivated by trypsin and sodium deoxycholate. The virus was labile at 50\u00b0C in diluted medium, but readily stabilized in the presence of 1 M MgCI2, agreeing with previous results (Sharpee et al., 1976) . Similarly, stabilization to heat by divalent cations has been reported for avian infectious bronchitis virus (Hopkins, 1967) .\n\nThe virus was stable at pH 5 and 7, while a slight loss of infectivity was observed at pH 3. Previous reports disagree regarding the stability of various coronaviruses at acid pH (McIntosh, 1974) . Recently, calf diarrhea coronavirus was reported to be as stable as transmissible gastro-enteritis vh~s at acid pH, while avian infectious bronchitis virus was acid labile (Sharpee et al., 1976) .\n\nThe virus was readily filtered through membrane filters with 200 or 100nm pore size, but not through 50-nm filters. On the other hand, the size o:~ the virion including surface projections, as determined by electron microscopy, ranged from 110 to 160 nm with an average of 130 nm, substantit~ting the reports of Stair et al. (1972) and Sharpee et al. (1976) . ~l~nese measurements seem to agree with the present results of filtration, because virions t~re pleomorphic and may be collapsed and flattened when negatively stained.\n\nThe buoyant density of the virion in CsC1 was estimated to be 1.24 g/ml, confirming the previous report by Stair et al. (1972) , while that in sucrose has been reported to be 1.18 g/ml (Sharpee et al., 1976) ."}
