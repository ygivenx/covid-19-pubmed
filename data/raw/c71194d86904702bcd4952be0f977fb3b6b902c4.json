Since it is known that macrophages are were pretreated with IFN-g before viral infection and particularly sensitive to IFN-g treatment (Ijzermans and when a low m.o.i. was used.

As shown in Fig. from DE-IFN-g-transfected cells, which contained IFN-g 4, both A59 and JHM were inhibited by rIFN-g by 1 to 2 at 180 U/ml, was mixed with a very low titer of JHM virus at approximately one infectious particle in each well of a 24-well plate. Cells were observed for cytopathic effects daily for 4 days and the number of fusion plaques was counted. Results of these experiments are presented in Table 2 . The number of plaques increased more slowly when the DE-IFN-g was present (for example, from 1 plaque on Day 1 to 12 plaques on Day 4), as compared to those in the control wells, in which DIexpressed CAT preparation was used (i.e., from 1 plaque on Day 1 to 30 plaques on Day 2 and too numerous to count by Day 3) (Table 2) . Initially, the plaque sizes in the presence of IFN-g were indistinguishable from those of the control wells (data not shown); however, by Day 3 or 4 postinfection, while all plaques in the IFN-g-treated cultures remained of uniform size, plaques in the absence of IFN-g became numerous and heterogeneous It has been suggested that IFN-g induces a number\n\nNo. of plaques c on of cellular proteins and enzymes which either act as T cells (Okamura et al., 1995) .

Similar results were obtained when various concentrations of rIFNg (50, 100, and 150 U/ml) were used, suggesting that 50 U/ml rIFN-g is sufficient to prevent virus spread in vitro (data not shown).\n\nSensitivity of different JHM variants to IFN-g treatment in vitro was assessed in an effort to determine whether the IFN-g sensitivity correlates with the pathogenicity of the virus in vivo. Three JHM variants with different degrees of neurovirulence were used: DL (LD 50 1-5 PFU), DS (LD 50 100-200 PFU), and 2.2-V-1 (LD 50 2000-10,000 PFU) (Stohlman et al., 1982 (Stohlman et al., , 1995 Fleming et al., 1986 Fleming et al., , 1987 . DL causes little demyelination and infects predominantly neurons whereas variant 2.2-V-1 causes extensive demyelination and infects predominantly glial cells with a particular tropism for oligodendrocytes. Variant DS causes less demyelination than variant 2.2-V-1. DBT cells pretreated with IFN-g (180 U/ml) for 24 hr were infected, and the same concentrations of IFN-g were maintained throughout the infection. At 24 hr postinfection, culture medium was collected and virus titer determined by plaque assay. As shown in Fig. 6 , a reduction of approximately 2.5 log 10 in pathogenicity in vivo, groups of C57BL/6 mice were infected with 1 1 10 5 PFU of A59 virus containing either DE-IFN-g small numbers of perivascular and subarachnoid mononuor DE-CAT.
