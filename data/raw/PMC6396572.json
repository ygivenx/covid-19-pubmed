{"title": "What Have We Learned About Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Emergence in Humans? A Systematic Literature Review", "body": "September 2012 saw the identification of a novel human coronavirus, now known as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (ProMED-mail 2012, Zaki et al. 2012). MERS-CoV is a beta-coronavirus distinct from but genetically related to the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus (Hilgenfeld and Peiris 2013, de Wit et al. 2016).\n\nAs MERS was identified a few years after the 2003 SARS outbreak, which spread across continents and raised pandemic concerns, there has been continuing concern about the pandemic potential of MERS-CoV (Hilgenfeld and Peiris 2013, de Wit et al. 2016). To assess and anticipate potential epidemic spread of MERS-CoV, it is essential to better understand the virology; human clinical characteristics, possible therapeutic and preventive options; epidemiology and transmission; and animal interfaces and possible origins and natural hosts.\n\nMERS was first identified in a patient with lower respiratory disease by a physician in Saudi Arabia, and subsequently, the virus was identified and characterized from this patient's sputum sample by researchers in Saudi Arabia and at Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands. Since then (to December 2018), 2266 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases and 804 deaths across 27 countries (35.5% crude case fatality rate [CFR]) have been reported to the WHO (Fig. 1), with the majority of cases (1888) and deaths (730) reported from Saudi Arabia (World Health Organization 2018a, World Health Organization/EMRO 2018). Cases continue to occur (World Health Organization/EMRO 2018).\n\nAlthough the first known MERS-CoV cases were from Jordan (confirmed retrospectively, and the source is still unknown) (Hijawi et al. 2013), about 80% of MERS-CoV cases originate from or passed through Saudi Arabia. The infection is likely zoonotic; although origins and transmission are poorly understood, the dromedary camel is the one documented source of human zoonotic infection (Memish et al. 2014e).\n\nA systematic review of MERS-CoV research was conducted to survey our current understanding of MERS-CoV and to identify research gaps in four major areas: (1) virology; (2) clinical characteristics, outcomes, and therapeutic and preventive options; (3) epidemiology and transmission; and (4) animal interface and the search for natural hosts of MERS-CoV.\n\nWe conducted a systematic literature review, using Embase, Google Scholar, MEDLINE/PubMed, supplemented by Thomson-Reuters \u201cWeb of Science\u201d\u2122 (all databases), to identify peer-reviewed published articles on MERS-CoV available by July 14, 2017. All searches were for articles published from 2012 onward, since MERS was first identified in 2012. The following search terms were used in all the databases for matches in title only (Google Scholar), title or abstract (Embase and MEDLINE/PubMed), or topic (\u201cWeb of Science\u201d): \u201cnovel coronavirus,\u201d \u201cnovel coronavirus EMC,\u201d \u201cnovel coronavirus Erasmus,\u201d \u201chCoV-EMC,\u201d \u201cMERS-CoV\u201d (a PubMed \u201cMeSH\u201d term), \u201cMERS coronavirus,\u201d \u201cMiddle East Respiratory Syndrome,\u201d and \u201cMiddle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus\u201d (a PubMed MeSH term).\n\nWe reviewed the titles and abstracts of all resulting citations to identify relevant articles for this systematic review, following PRISMA guidelines (Fig. 2) (Moher et al. 2009). For all nonduplicate articles, excluding opinion and editorial pieces, on MERS-CoV or a related topic, we retrieved the full-text version and indexed the citation. Inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed primary research articles about MERS-CoV published between 2012 and mid-July 2017 (inclusive, with periodic updates to 2018) and adding unique information about MERS-CoV to the knowledge base within at least one of the four key themes: (1) virology; (2) clinical characteristics, outcomes, and therapeutic and preventive options; (3) epidemiology and transmission; and (4) animal interface and search for natural hosts of MERS-CoV.\n\nOnly English language publications (or with an English-language abstract available) were included. Of the 3364 titles retrieved, 407 were unique (nonduplicate), scientific research works relevant to MERS-CoV, and of these, 208 were originally included in the review based on the inclusion criteria (some interim updates have been made during article preparation).\n\nThe main laboratory assays for MERS-CoV are molecular tests to detect viral RNA, and serology (for prior infection) (CDC 2014, World Health Organization 2018b).\n\nReverse transcription PCR either real time or conventional, is now standard. For diagnostic screening, PCR primer sets to regions upstream of the E gene (\u201cup-E\u201d) are most frequently used, with ORF1a or ORF1b for confirmation (Corman et al. 2012a, 2012b). Sensitivity was reported as \u223c3.4 viral gene copies/25 \u03bcL reaction for up-E and \u223c64 copies for ORF1b, with specificity approaching 100% using a test panel of other known coronaviruses and clinical respiratory samples (Corman et al. 2012a). ORF1a PCR was reported to have comparable sensitivity and specificity to up-E (Corman et al. 2012b). Commercial kits are available, with comparable results reported (Corman et al. 2014c, Seong et al. 2016, Mohamed et al. 2017).\n\nFor sequencing, tests have been developed that may be better suited for strain differentiation, targeting regions of the RdRp (RNA polymerase) or N (nucleocapsid) genes (Corman et al. 2012b); there are a number of publications reporting on their use (Corman et al. 2012b; CDC 2014, Lu et al. 2014).\n\nAnother PCR test, targeting the S (spike) region, was developed to monitor circulation of MERS-CoV variants (Abd et al. 2013, Smits et al. 2015). Other types of nucleic acid tests have also been used (Shirato et al. 2014), as has immunohistochemistry (Ng et al. 2016).\n\nSerologic samples are usually screened using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Reusken et al. 2013a). If the sample is ELISA positive, CDC and other agencies formerly recommended confirmatory testing, first by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and then by the gold standard plaque-reduction neutralization test or microneutralization (CDC 2014), but now recommend going directly to microneutralization assay (CDC 2014, revised). Other serological tests such as pseudoparticle neutralization (Perera et al. 2013) and array-based serology (Reusken et al. 2013a) have also been developed.\n\nUnfortunately, there are pitfalls in serology, including cross-reactivity and false negatives. In 2014, CDC preliminarily reported a MERS-CoV case with a positive ELISA and IFA, but later retracted the case report due to a negative microneutralization result (Breakwell et al. 2015). Consequently, CDC no longer recommends IFA but instead now recommends using two different ELISA tests, with microneutralization for confirmation (CDC 2014, revised). Conversely, low or waning antibody response after infection, which would yield false negatives, has also been reported (Alshukairi et al. 2016, Choe et al. 2017). False negatives are further discussed below in the section on Host Response.\n\nClinical findings have been described and reviewed in detail (Assiri et al. 2013a, Saad et al. 2014, Rasmussen et al. 2015, World Health Organization 2015). The incubation period is \u223c5\u20137 days (in some cases up to 12 days) (Assiri et al. 2013a, 2013b). Fever, cough, shortness of breath, and pneumonia (with abnormal chest radiography) are the most frequently noted signs; myalgia, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, chills or rigors, or malaise are also seen (Assiri et al. 2013a, Drosten et al. 2013, Eckerle et al. 2013, Guery et al. 2013, Ajlan et al. 2014, Arabi et al. 2014, Faure et al. 2014, Kapoor et al. 2014, Scheuplein et al. 2015, Hunter et al. 2016). Renal failure or pulmonary failure and shock were commonly described in severe and fatal cases. Overall CFR is \u223c35.5% (World Health Organization 2018a).\n\nViral excretion from the respiratory tract has been documented through the first month of illness (Memish et al. 2014d, Poissy et al. 2014, Spanakis et al. 2014), with greater viral loads detected in lower respiratory tract specimens compared with upper respiratory tract (Drosten et al. 2013, Guery et al. 2013, Kapoor et al. 2014). Viral excretion for short periods was reported in urine and stool, although viral loads were low (Drosten et al. 2013). There was at least one report that MERS-CoV secondary cases (individuals infected by a primary case) clear infection earlier than primary cases (Memish et al. 2014d).\n\nDisease outcomes differed by age and comorbidities (Assiri et al. 2013a, 2013b, Khalid et al. 2014, Saad et al. 2014, Alsahafi and Cheng 2016). Most cases in Saudi Arabia have occurred among men, ages 45 or older, and those living in areas of lower relative humidity and high temperature (Alghamdi et al. 2014). A review of 939 cases in Saudi Arabia found that CFR increases with age, from 12.5% among those 19 years or younger to 86.2% among those 80 years or older (Alsahafi and Cheng 2016). Mortality was more frequent and rapid in individuals with comorbidities such as diabetes, chronic renal disease, and, in one study, higher body mass index (Assiri et al. 2013a, 2013b, Al-Tawfiq et al. 2014, Khalid et al. 2014, Saad et al. 2014, Alsahafi and Cheng 2016). More severe disease has been associated with higher viral load (Feikin et al. 2015).\n\nThere are a handful of case reports on MERS outcomes in other vulnerable populations, including three cases in pregnant women and one in an HIV-positive individual.\n\nIn the three documented cases of pregnant women with MERS-CoV infection, one woman in her second trimester of pregnancy (\u223c5 months) experienced a stillbirth; the mother survived (Payne et al. 2014). The two other women were reported to be in their third trimester (32 weeks) when they presented with MERS. A healthy infant was delivered in each of these cases, although one mother died despite interferon (IFN) treatment (Malik et al. 2016), and one recovered despite the severity of her symptoms (Alserehi et al. 2016). Both were apparently healthy before infection and in their 30s. It is therefore possible that infection during the third trimester may be associated with better fetal outcomes, while other factors may be more critical for maternal outcome, but the numbers are too small to generalize.\n\nThere has been at least one published case of an individual with HIV/AIDS acquiring MERS-CoV (Shalhoub et al. 2015). This patient was probably infected with MERS-CoV during a hospital stay and subsequently shed virus for 38 days. The patient recovered after treatment (Shalhoub et al. 2015).\n\nThere have been a number of studies on immune function (Corman et al. 2016, Zhao et al. 2017). Neutralizing antibodies were detected in many patients, but several studies suggested that neutralizing antibodies induced during infection did not appear to be protective (Corman et al. 2016, Zhao et al. 2017), and it has been suggested that higher antibody titers may be more closely correlated with greater viral load and consequently worse prognosis (Zhao et al. 2017).\n\nKinetics of response may also be important. An antibody kinetics study with 17 patients in South Korea (from the same research group that later reported waning antibody titers in patients over a 1-year follow-up) found that most patients produced a robust neutralizing IgG antibody response beginning at about 2 weeks and peaking by about 3 weeks; delayed response was generally correlated with a less favorable prognosis (Park et al. 2015).\n\nPersistence of antibody generally seems to follow a similar pattern. Detectable neutralizing antibody titers (\u226520) have been reported in some patients up to 34 months (Payne et al. 2016). However, results varied considerably even within this group, and most reports indicate that duration of antibody response, as well as its magnitude, seemed most closely correlated with disease severity and that antibodies could be low or even absent in mild or asymptomatic infection (Alshukairi et al. 2016, Choe et al. 2017). These reports of low or waning antibody titers, especially in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals, may make serology problematic as a marker of population prevalence.\n\nThere is evidence that innate immunity, including IFNs and cytokines, and cellular immunity by CD8+ (presumably \u201ckiller\u201d) T cells may play important roles in host defense and recovery (Faure et al. 2014, Zhao et al. 2017). Zhao et al. (2017) compared the role of antibodies and T cells in human MERS cases, and found that survivors mounted a vigorous CD8+ T cell response even in the absence of a detectable antibody response.\n\nMacrophages also appear to play an important role, but there are limited and somewhat ambiguous data from the mouse model (Coleman et al. 2017), human cells (Zhou et al. 2014), and patients (Faure et al. 2014). With a number of viruses, it is not unusual for resting macrophages to be permissive for replication but for macrophages to show antiviral activity after activation (such as by IFN-\u03b3) (Morse and Morahan 1981). Dendritic cells have been reported to produce IFN in response to infection (Scheuplein et al. 2015).\n\nOne challenge to overcome is the effect of the virus on host defenses. A caveat is that much of this research (although not all) has been done in vitro and may not necessarily be comparable with the immunological results described above in patients. MERS-CoV has been reported to inhibit host innate immunity (Lau et al. 2013). Impaired IFN and cytokine responses may mediate some of these effects, based on assays on cells from MERS patients (Faure et al. 2014, Scheuplein et al. 2015), although the numbers of patients were small. In vitro studies have shown that MERS-CoV could downregulate expression of IFN-stimulated gene subsets (Yang et al. 2013), chemokines (Mielech et al. 2014), and IFN-\u03b2. Another study found that MERS-CoV may cause delayed induction of proinflammatory cytokines together with suppression of the host's innate antiviral response (Lau et al. 2013).\n\nVirus replication in human monocyte-derived macrophages has been described, with increased expression of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (up to a 3-fold increase over normal levels), interleukin 6 (up to almost a 6-fold increase), interleukin 12, IFN-\u03b3, and chemokines (some at a 10-fold or more increase and even more prominently than with SARS-CoV) being reported (Zhou et al. 2014).\n\nDevelopment of a human (and possibly camel) vaccine for MERS-CoV should be a key priority, given concerns about its spread and pandemic potential, but vaccine development can be a long process that is often driven by economics (Modjarrad 2016).\n\nMuch of the focus thus far has centered on the identification of the residues within the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein, conferring the best chance of protection (Du et al. 2013a, 2013b, Lan et al. 2014, Ma et al. 2014a, 2014b). A number of other antigens, some in viral vectors, have been tested in the laboratory (Song et al. 2013, Kim et al. 2014).\n\nA replication defective full-length cDNA clone of the MERS-CoV genome has been developed for identifying future vaccine candidates (Almaz\u00e1n et al. 2013). Vaccine candidates for dromedary camels have also been investigated, and have been reported to elicit protective responses (using the MERS-CoV spike protein in a poxvirus vector) (Haagmans et al. 2016).\n\nThere are special challenges to developing a MERS vaccine. The sporadic nature of human MERS-CoV infection and the difficulty of identifying suitable animal models for challenge studies make controlled trials difficult. Disease in camels usually appears mild (Adney et al. 2014), reducing the economic incentive for immunization. A camel vaccine could also be given in combination with a required vaccine, e.g., rabies, as suggested by Wirblich et al. (2017), or camelpox, as suggested by Haagmans et al. (2016).\n\nCorrelates of protection and duration of immunity are also uncertain. There are reports of strong antibody responses (Haagmans et al. 2016), but it has been suggested that the presence of neutralizing antibodies may not be protective in camels (Hemida et al. 2014) or humans (Corman et al. 2016, Zhao et al. 2017), and waning antibody titers have been reported in humans who have recovered from MERS-CoV infection (Choe et al. 2017). On the contrary, the reports of protection of mice by passive transfer of neutralizing antibodies suggest that this might be overcome by optimizing timing and dose (Zhao et al. 2017).\n\nResearch on MERS-CoV vaccine candidates is ongoing, and at least one candidate vaccine has now progressed to a Phase I human clinical trial (Modjarrad 2016, CEPI 2017). In a promising development, the recently launched Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has listed MERS vaccine as one of its initial targets.\n\nDespite the mass gathering of individuals at the annual Hajj pilgrimage (Khan et al. 2013), to date it has not resulted in any known MERS-CoV transmission events (Barasheed et al. 2014, Benkouiten et al. 2014, Gautret et al. 2014, Memish et al. 2014b, 2014c, Aberle et al. 2015, Annan et al. 2015), confirming modeling estimates for the 2014 Hajj (Lessler et al. 2014). Two travelers returning to the Netherlands from a separate pilgrimage (Umrah) in May 2014 were found to have MERS-CoV (Kraaij-Dirkzwager et al. 2014). Many of the travel-related cases have been tabulated (Pavli et al. 2014, Sridhar et al. 2015, Carias et al. 2016). In all these cases, casual transmission (outside of family and health care settings) has not been observed.\n\nDromedary camels are the only documented zoonotic source of human infection, and there is considerable circumstantial evidence supporting camel-to-human transmission, including evidence of camels and humans becoming infected with an identical MERS-CoV (Azhar et al. 2014, Ferguson and Kerkhove 2014, Memish et al. 2014e). Identical genomic sequences of MERS-CoV were isolated from a camel owner who died from MERS-CoV and his camel who had rhinorrhea at that time; identical MERS-CoV RNA fragments were later detected in the air at the camel barn (Azhar et al. 2014). Serology suggested that the camel was infected before the owner (Azhar et al. 2014). Critics have suggested that the identical sequences may be due to cross-contamination (Drosten et al. 2014), but the authors maintain that the isolates were collected on different days and processed in different facilities. Other epidemiologic investigations have found similar evidence, but directionality was not implied (Ferguson and Kerkhove 2014, Memish et al. 2014e).\n\nIn outbreak sites, viral genomic sequences from camels have matched those published for humans, and one analysis of MERS-CoV among camels showed that many of the camel viruses can be classified into clades that correlate with human outbreaks (Alagaili et al. 2014). Interestingly, three dromedary camel strains of MERS-CoV had similar viral replication competence to human strains in Vero-E6 cells and human respiratory tract explants (Chan et al. 2014).\n\nThis evidence suggests that camels would appear involved in cross-species transmission of MERS-CoV, although the precise mechanism and frequency remain uncertain.\n\nOccupational exposure to camels would seem a particularly strong risk factor for infection, but its relative importance and relative risk of different exposures are not well documented (Hemida et al. 2015). As camels are widely used in the region for a variety of purposes, many people have contact with camels, and exposure is often invoked in nonoccupational primary cases. Assessment of camel exposure is further complicated by the varying and sometimes vague definitions used to classify camel exposure, and the multiple types of possible exposures. Even so, it has been hypothesized that camel exposure is commonly underreported (Gossner et al. 2016). There is a critical need for clearer definitions and measurements of \u201ccamel exposure,\u201d and to standardize methodology.\n\nEvidence to date indicates that MERS-like coronaviruses have been circulating in camels since at least the 1980s, before the first detection of MERS-CoV in humans (M\u00fcller et al. 2014). Seropositivity has been found consistently in African and Middle Eastern camels since 1983 (Table 1). There is virologic evidence of MERS-CoV infection in camels in Qatar (Ferguson and Kerkhove 2014, Haagmans et al. 2014, Raj et al. 2014), Egypt (Chu et al. 2014, Ali et al. 2017a, 2017b), Oman (Nowotny and Kolodziejek 2014), Saudi Arabia (Hemida et al. 2014), Sudan, and elsewhere (Chu et al. 2015, Ali et al. 2017a).\n\nIncreasing genomic evidence suggests a diversity of coronaviruses in camels throughout the Middle East and Africa, including in major source countries for camel imports to the Middle East, cross-neutralizing with MERS-CoV but having divergent sequences and probably not human pathogens (Chu et al. 2015, 2018). This may explain the high apparent seropositivity in camels in Africa in the absence of known human cases of MERS.\n\nMaintenance of the virus in the camel population remains an open question. Symptomatic MERS-CoV infection has been documented in both calves and adult camels (Adney et al. 2014), and viral shedding was detected in nasal secretions up to 7 days postinoculation with MERS-CoV (Adney et al. 2014), as well as in milk and possibly feces (Hemida et al. 2014, Reusken et al. 2014a). Camel milk has been suggested as a possible source of infection for both humans and camel foals (Hemida et al. 2014, Reusken et al. 2014a, van Doremalen et al. 2014). One study demonstrated that added MERS-CoV can survive in milk for at least 48 h at both 4\u00b0C and 22\u00b0C, although not detected after pasteurization (van Doremalen et al. 2014).\n\nOther possible livestock hosts for MERS-CoV have been investigated, and have generally been negative (Hemida et al. 2013, Perera et al. 2013, Reusken et al. 2013b, 2013c, Alagaili et al. 2014, Alexandersen et al. 2014, van Doremalen et al. 2014, Meyer et al. 2015). One study found 15 seropositive alpacas, which are members of the camelid family, in Qatar (Reusken et al. 2016). Experimentally infected alpacas in one study demonstrated upper respiratory tract infection, viral shedding, and transmission to other alpacas (Adney et al. 2016).\n\nThe search for the origins and natural hosts of MERS-CoV continues. Bat species across the world are known to host a wide variety of coronaviruses, including beta-coronaviruses (the genus to which MERS-CoV belongs) (Anthony et al. 2013, Corman et al. 2013, Lelli et al. 2013, Memish et al. 2013a), and bats tend to show greater coronavirus diversity than other mammals (Drexler et al. 2014, Anthony et al. 2017). Consequently, much research has focused on the possible origin of MERS-CoV in bats. Possibly further supporting this hypothesis, in bat cell lines MERS-CoV has been reported to replicate only in those cell lines that express DPP4, the functional human receptor for the virus, and not in bat cell lines lacking DPP4 expression (Raj et al. 2013, Cai et al. 2014).\n\nIt is possible that MERS-CoV itself may be a relatively new introduction in humans. A phylogenetic analysis utilizing 65 complete or partially complete MERS-CoV genomic sequences (32 from Saudi Arabian cases in 2013) estimated that the most recent common ancestor was in March 2012 (95% CI: December 2011\u2013June 2012) (Cotten et al. 2014).\n\nOne study, from analysis of an S1 subunit in its spike gene, suggested that MERS-CoV may have arisen from intraspike recombination between two ancestral coronaviruses (Corman et al. 2014).\n\nThe virus has not been isolated from a bat, although a portion of MERS-CoV RNA sequence apparently was identified in a bat (the insectivorous bat Taphozous perforatus, the Egyptian tomb bat) in Saudi Arabia in the same site as an early human case (100% nucleotide match, although this was only \u223c180 nucleotides in the relatively well-conserved RdRp region) (Memish et al. 2013a). MERS-like coronaviruses, including the closely related HKU4, which also uses a DPP4 receptor, and HKU5, first identified by Woo et al. in 2006 (Woo et al. 2006, Lau et al. 2013, Matthews et al. 2014, Wang et al. 2014), and others have been identified in bat species in China (Matthews et al. 2014, Yang et al. 2014), Mexico (Anthony et al. 2013), South Africa (Ithete et al. 2013, Corman et al. 2014a), and Uganda (Anthony et al. 2017).\n\nSince the detection of MERS-CoV in 2012, a large body of research has been amassed, as evidenced by the hundreds of unique results from our database searches. The virus has rapidly been characterized, and its functional human receptor swiftly identified. Species and cellular tropism studies have complemented clinical investigations, and laboratory work has provided further insights on MERS-CoV pathogenesis.\n\nObservational research from outbreaks in the Middle East and South Korea has generated a growing repository of clinical data, basic epidemiology, and genome sequences. Other studies have evaluated the roles of human/animal interfaces, health care settings, family clusters, and travel in MERS-CoV transmission. Furthermore, bats have been implicated as the possible origin of MERS-CoV, while dromedary camels have been shown to be likely sources of many human infections. There has been progress in developing therapeutics and vaccines. Although these have not yet progressed to full clinical trials, they could in the foreseeable future.\n\nA major reason we undertook this review was to determine what gaps still exist. Of the publications we originally identified, the largest category (80 publications) was in laboratory or basic science studies, followed by surveillance (59), animal interfaces (55), clinical aspects and health care (50), therapeutics and vaccines (42), while human transmission and epidemiology was one of the sparsest (35, including investigations of hospital outbreaks and travel-related cases), noting that these categories are not necessarily exclusive and there is overlap.\n\nIn general, continued surveillance for MERS-CoV in affected countries should continue, prioritizing surveillance in humans, camels, and bats, given their apparent importance. As serology may not be reliable, due to cross-reactions and possibly waning antibodies, virologic surveillance and sequencing should also be attempted on selected specimens whenever feasible.\n\nAlthough the role of bats is yet to be fully elucidated, and evidence is lacking that bats are a source of human infection, the diversity of coronaviruses, including MERS-like coronaviruses, in bat species across the globe indicates that continued research and ongoing surveillance of coronaviruses in bats are justified (Lau et al. 2013, Lelli et al. 2013, Yang et al. 2014).\n\nA number of key gaps remain in epidemiology, including transmission, population-based incidence or prevalence rates, and geographic and demographic distributions of infections. Based on the limited human seroprevalence data so far, it seems likely that population prevalence is low, but the baseline should be established. It is also not clear whether seropositivity is a reliable indicator of prior infection. The finding of variable low antibody titers at 1 year postinfection (Choe et al. 2017) indicates that methods other than traditional serosurveys may be required (Reusken et al. 2013a, Malik et al. 2016). If serology is not reliable, this raises the question of how to screen populations. There are methods that are both more sensitive and more specific for antibody detection (Mishra et al. 2018), as well as assays of cellular immunity (Zhao et al. 2017), but are costlier and more difficult for population screening.\n\nContact tracing has identified asymptomatic infections, but studies of their frequency and transmissibility have been limited. Many of those infected are health care workers in whom these questions could be systematically studied. Relatively little is known about the natural history of human asymptomatic infections. Further studies of virus shedding, seroconversion, and transmission in asymptomatic infections are needed. Some evidence suggests that secondary cases have lower average CFRs and that subsequent links in the chain of MERS-CoV infection may decrease in severity.\n\nExposure in most primary cases is still largely inferential at best. While camels are apparently often the likely source, the definitions of camel exposure are varied, preventing clear epidemiological inferences. Definitions of the exposures and the methodology and metrics for determining exposure should be clarified and standardized. Even if camels are a principal source of human infections, this would still not explain a substantial portion of primary human cases that did not have apparent camel exposure before infection. This raises questions about how and where these other primary cases acquired MERS-CoV infection, whether through other animal species, unidentified zoonotic exposure, unrecognized infectious persons (such as asymptomatic infectious individuals), or environmental contamination.\n\nConsequently, clarifying the routes of transmission remains crucial and should receive emphasis. To date, there is no compelling evidence of direct human-to-human transmission, such as through droplets, but secondary infection has been reported. It is often unclear how health care workers become infected. There is possible evidence of environmental contamination (fomites) in health care settings (nosocomial transmission) and close contact with an active MERS-CoV case.\n\nVarious infection control lapses have been documented, but rarely a specific event or route (Ben Embarek and Van Kerkhove 2015, Alraddadi et al. 2016, Van Kerkhove et al. 2016). Rigorous infection control therefore remains essential and could prevent many secondary cases. In the interim, better documentation or identification of the specific lapses that led to infection would be of great value in understanding mechanisms of transmission and is one of the greatest knowledge gaps. Much of the evidence for fomite transmission, for example, remains anecdotal (Van Kerkhove et al. 2016).\n\nThe mechanisms supporting chains of human MERS-CoV transmission need to be more fully evaluated. These gaps indicate a need for additional research, and also for consistent terminology and clear definitions. Although the epidemiological literature on MERS-CoV is large, much of it is fragmented and inconsistently reported. It is often difficult to deduce the sequence of infections, relationships between cases, or specific exposures. A comprehensive and consistent database or registry should be a priority.\n\nGenome sequencing has proved useful in several respects. Genome sequencing was used to help determine viral circulation and ancestry (Cotten et al. 2014), and to differentiate apparently similar and serologically cross-reacting coronaviruses in camels, addressing the (still unresolved) question of why MERS seems regionally limited, while many camels are imported from other places (Chu et al. 2015, 2018). It has also been used to reconstruct the transmission events and help to establish chains of infection (Assiri et al. 2013b, Cotten et al. 2013), but it must be noted that there is a pressing need for more rigorous conventional epidemiology as well to validate the methodologies. These approaches might well serve a complementary function in advancing our understanding.\n\nThere remains a need for effective therapeutics and vaccines. Treatment remains symptomatic, with insufficient clinical data on other therapeutic options. These options will always be limited in number, but their development should be approached more systematically with shared protocols and critical comparison of results. As a number of drug and vaccine candidates have been identified, there may be more options available for future clinical trials. There appear to be efforts underway to develop some clinical trials based on standardized protocols. This is needed, despite the challenges presented by the sporadic nature of the cases, and the relative rarity of clinical MERS.\n\nThere were several limitations in this systematic review of MERS-CoV. Only publications in English or with English language abstracts were eligible for inclusion, although most of the cases have been in Arabic-speaking areas and Korea. However, hundreds of English language reports were available from countries around the world, including the Middle East and South Korea, minimizing this concern. Second, this review contains publications indexed by these databases by July 2017, so it is possible that some publications, especially recently published articles or manuscripts still in production, were unintentionally excluded from the review. We updated our literature review periodically during the preparation of this article to minimize the number of missed publications. Third, \u201cgray literature\u201d was not included, such as government reports and technical documents, and most meeting abstracts, although it is likely that important findings would have been submitted for journal publication.\n\nAs an emerging infection of zoonotic origin (Morse 1995), a unified One Health approach that engages the human health, livestock and companion animal, wildlife, and environment sectors will be crucial in dealing with MERS (Morse 2012, Morse et al. 2012). It could serve as an excellent case study for epidemiology and response to a new zoonotic, or emerging, infection."}
