{"title": "How to approach major surgery where patients refuse blood transfusion (including Jehovah's Witnesses)", "body": "T he surgical management of a Jehovah's Witness can be challenging since their beliefs do not permit the use of allogeneic blood products. 1, 2 This, along with a generally greater awareness amongst surgeons of transfusion risks and escalating costs (around \u00a3100 per unit of red blood cells 3 ) has resulted in a recent increase in popularity of transfusion avoidance strategies, often termed 'bloodless surgery'. These principles should not be limited to the Jehovah's Witness, but should form an integral part of everyday surgical practice. Since any surgeon may encounter this scenario, the aim of this article is to summarise the key concepts of bloodless surgery and to offer a practical guide on how to approach such cases.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses have been active in Britain since the 1880s and they now report a membership in England, Scotland and Wales of 125,000. Worldwide membership now exceeds 6.3 million with numbers having doubled since the mid 1980s. Hence the development of appropriate management strategies for Witness patients is increasingly important. Beliefs regarding blood products originate from distinctive interpretations of specific passages from the Bible. 1 You are to abstain from \u2026 blood Acts Ch. 15 \n\nThe refusal of blood products is a core value of the faith, 1, 2 and transfusion without consent would be regarded by members as a gross physical violation.\n\nAs a rule, Jehovah's Witnesses will accept most medical treatments, surgical procedures and administration of fluids such as crystalloids, colloids and starch. 4 The treatments that are viewed as unacceptable are the transfusion of whole blood, packed red cells, platelets, white cells or plasma. 5 However, derivatives of these are viewed as a matter of individual choice, for example products such as albumin, immunoglobulin, vaccines and clotting factors. 6 When referring to the use of such 'fractions' of blood components, Jehovah's Witnesses are encouraged to reach their own conscientious decisions. Similarly, organ transplantation (and donation) is viewed as a matter of individual choice. 5 Predonation of blood for the purposes of later autotransfusion (pre-deposit) is unacceptable, 7 although many Jehovah's Witnesses will accept peri-and postoperative autologous procedures based on a personal decision, especially when the removal and transfusion of blood can be managed via a continuous circuit such as heart bypass, acute normovolaemic haemodilution, dialysis or cell salvage machines. 8, 9 In recent years, some Witness patients have accepted the use of haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers without offending either conscience or community, 10 although many Jehovah's Witnesses may refuse such novel medications. Therefore, each patient's individual needs, values and beliefs must be assessed, acknowledged and respected. Specific treatments should be carefully discussed with the patient and family in order to clarify exactly what is acceptable. This may require a multidisciplinary approach, with medical and nursing staff as well as local representatives from the Jehovah's Witness hospital liaison committee, who can be of great assistance.\n\nA decision to refuse medical treatment from an informed, competent, adult patient must be respected by the medical practitioner, whether the reasons for such refusal are 'rational, irrational, unknown or even non-existent'. 11 The refusal of blood products may conflict with medical responsibilities for preserving life. In elective surgery this should rarely be an issue, providing decisions have been made clearly in advance (Table 1) . However, a difficult situation would be the management of an unconscious Jehovah's Witness patient with severe haemorrhage. In these circumstances, the doctor should search for clear evidence, such as an Advance Directive, stating that the patient would not accept blood products, even with lifethreatening bleeding. In the absence of such evidence, the doctor should act in what he or she sees as the best interests of the patient with or without the use of blood. 8 For children of Jehovah's Witnesses, legal precedent supports life-saving transfusion against parents' wishes, but two doctors of consultant status should clearly document the reasons for transfusion. 8 In less urgent cases, the matter may be referred to the courts. 9\n\nMany Jehovah's Witnesses will have given prior consideration to the use of blood products, and should produce a detailed Health Care Advance Directive. This is a document stating the patient's wishes regarding the use of blood products or in relation to any other treatment and a copy may have been given to the GP. The wishes outlined in an Advance Directive must be respected, but doctors should scrutinise the form in detail and satisfy themselves that its content is valid and applicable in the given circumstances. The implications relevant to the case should be discussed with the patient. A copy should be kept within the hospital notes. There is no defined 'legally acceptable' format for an Advance Directive, but Jehovah's Witnesses have two standardised forms (Appendix 1, 2), the second of which is characteristically carried at all times and is designed to provide succinct directives in an emergency situation.\n\nIn the case of Jehovah's Witnesses, specific details as to which treatments would be acceptable should be clearly established and documented. The specific risks and benefits of any procedure including the added risk of blood refusal should be considered and discussed with the patient. The threshold for surgical treatment may be altered in some cases. Explanation of risks should include local complication rates, and the surgeon might need to consider giving an explanation of the risk of needing transfusion under ordinary circumstances. The UK Department of Health has produced a series of consent \n\nThe principles of bloodless surgery originate from the 1960s when the availability of blood for transfusion resulted in increasingly major surgery being undertaken, from which patients refusing blood were excluded. 12 The term 'bloodless surgery' refers to a series of measures in the pre-, peri-and postoperative care of patients that aim to reduce the need for allogeneic blood transfusion, and improve patient outcomes. These principles have gained popularity of late, and many centres of bloodless surgery exist in North America. This approach has gained credence, as the deleterious effects of blood transfusion become more apparent. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 13 West Nile virus 14 and prion-related diseases 15 are the latest to join human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, C and others on the list of potentially transmissible diseases. Furthermore, in an attempt to reduce the risk of transmitting infection, the donor pool for blood products has been curtailed. 16 The principles of bloodless surgery are summarised in Table 2 .\n\nA detailed history and thorough clinical examination are important. This will allow assessment of physiological reserve and, therefore, ability to withstand hypovolaemia. Pre-existing cardiac or respiratory disease should be optimised prior to surgery. The patient should also be questioned about bleeding disorders, and medication that may increase blood loss (e.g. NSAIDs, steroids) should be reviewed, and preferably stopped. Coagulation defects should be corrected. \n\nBloodless surgery requires a co-ordinated multidisciplinary approach. Senior surgical, anaesthetic and theatre staff should discuss cases in advance, and the skill mix and number of support staff may need to be modified to facilitate blood conservation strategies (e.g. cell salvage). The surgeon should ensure that the appropriate equipment is available.\n\nThe surgeon will need to pay meticulous attention to haemostasis during the operation. There is a trend to the increased use of diathermy dissection during surgery. This is a safe and effective surgical tool, which can reduce blood loss. 19 Other technological advances that may minimise blood loss include the harmonic scalpel. The use of local haemostatic aids such as bone wax, or absorbable cellulose or collagens may reduce unnecessary haemorrhage. 12 Also, when feasible, procedures should be performed in stages to minimise loss of a large blood volume. For example, a bilateral mastectomy could be performed in two stages. Minimally invasive techniques, which are usually associated with less blood loss, should also be considered where appropriate.\n\nThe anaesthetic team can manipulate the physiological response during surgery to reduce bleeding. Controlled hypotension is a well recognised technique whereby the mean arterial pressure is maintained at a low level during surgery, to minimise intra-operative bleeding. 20 This carries numerous risks. A hypotensive state may result in irreversible ischaemic damage to kidneys, brain or myocardium. 21 In addition, haemostasis performed during controlled hypotension may be inadequate when the \n\nANH involves the removal of whole blood from the patient pre-operatively, and replacement with crystalloid or colloid fluids to maintain intravascular volume. Blood lost during surgery and in the postoperative period has a reduced haemoglobin concentration, resulting in fewer red blood cells lost. The technique relies on an adequate physiological compensation to the acute blood loss, primarily by an increase in cardiac output. 22 The removed blood is available for transfusion should it be needed. Factors such as coexisting illness, response to venesection and experience of the team all influence the quantity of blood withdrawn, and no universally accepted guidelines exist. Relative contraindications to ANH include severe anaemia, ischaemic heart disease and renal failure. 22 ANH may be acceptable to Jehovah's Witness patients, especially if the removed blood can be kept in a closed circuit. 9\n\nBlood lost intra-and postoperatively can be collected and transfused back to the patient, with the use of specialist equipment. Cell salvage machines can be used during surgery and are able to collect and filter blood removed by suction and in swabs, which can then be given back to the patient. 23 Drains can also be attached to sterile collection systems to allow transfusion, a procedure most commonly seen in orthopaedic surgery. Although adverse effects of cell salvage have been reported, 24 these are extremely rare. Many surgeons advocate the use of cell salvage in cases of malignancy and infection as the risks are thought to be low. 25, 26 However, further research is needed to clarify the role of cell salvage in these patients. It is worth noting that some Jehovah's Witnesses may not accept blood salvaged from used swabs, because this involves a temporary interruption in the blood 'circuit'.\n\nThe surgical team should remain vigilant to the possibility of reactionary or secondary haemorrhage. Continued bleeding should be aggressively managed by postoperative blood salvage, or surgical intervention to stop haemorrhage. Prolonged hypertension should be avoided in the postoperative period. Postoperative blood tests should be rationalised and samples sent in paediatric or adult micro-sample tubes (Becton, Dickinson and Company, NJ, USA).\n\nAnaemia should be adequately treated prior to surgery. However, significant intra-operative blood loss may require specific measures to increase red blood cell production. Iron, vitamin B 12 and folate should be adequately supplemented, and recombinant erythropoietin can be used if necessary. 12, 27 In some cases, poor nutrition may result in impaired red cell production. 12 Nutritional supplementation should, therefore, be offered at an early stage in appropriate patients.\n\nPostoperative patients may have impaired oxygen delivery via a number of mechanisms. Respiratory function should be optimised, involving routine breathing exercises and supplemental oxygen therapy for all patients and more aggressive chest physiotherapy for high-risk patients. The surgical team should be alert to the risk of postoperative respiratory complications, and ensure appropriate patient monitoring or escalation of treatment as required. A multidisciplinary approach is often required, including physiotherapists, nursing staff, respiratory physicians and critical care staff. Intravascular volume should be monitored and adequately maintained. This, along with thorough preoperative cardiac assessment will help to maximise cardiac output and, therefore, oxygen delivery. The use of hyperbaric oxygen has been described, 28 but has a very limited role in routine postoperative patient care.\n\nThe physiological responses to infection and pain may result in an increased metabolic rate, and consequently higher oxygen consumption. Analgesia should be optimised, and appropriate prophylactic measures against infection should be used. Epidural analgesia usually provides excellent pain relief, and may also reduce postoperative respiratory complications. 29, 30 In experienced hands, sedation or paralysis and ventilation may also be used to control oxygen consumption.\n\nThe refusal of blood products by patients has led to greater awareness of blood conservation strategies, such as those described in this article. Adherence to these principles may help to reduce blood loss and the need for transfusion, although some techniques carry risks that should be considered when planning patient management. Many of these principles should be applied to the management of all surgical patients, since Jehovah's Witnesses are not the only group of patients that refuse blood products. Increased awareness of the risks of transfusion, including communicable diseases such as HIV has resulted in HOW TO APPROACH MAJOR SURGERY WHERE PATIENTS REFUSE BLOOD TRANSFUSION 6 GOHEL greater numbers of patients not accepting blood for nonreligious reasons. The surgical team should, therefore, be familiar with the risks of blood transfusion, and be prepared to communicate these to the patient.\n\nThere may be considerable variation in individual thresholds for requesting and administering crossmatched blood among medical professionals. Transfusion 'triggers' should, therefore, be agreed for individual patients to reduce the risk of unnecessary transfusion. It may be appropriate to have local audit information on transfusion needs for major operations, and discuss this with the patient as part of informed consent.\n\nImplementing the principles of bloodless surgery requires a co-ordinated team approach, across all phases of peri-operative care. Already standard in many centres across the world, these principles are likely to become increasingly prevalent in UK surgical practice."}
