This reaction provides initially a hydrazone derivative, RNHN=CR/CH 2 COX, I ( Fig. 1 ), which can be isolated but which readily undergoes cyclization to a pyrazone derivative, II ( Fig.1 ), (Nef, 1891; Katritzky et al., 1997; Wardell et al., 2007; de Lima et al., 2010) . Equilibrium involving tautomers of II in solution have been variously studied using NMR and IR spectroscopy and ab initio calculations. (Feeney et al., 1970; Hawkes et al., 1977; Freyer et al., 1983; Dardonville et al., 1998; Kleinpeter & Koch, 2001) . Crystal structures of various pyrazone compounds of forms IIa, IIb and IIc have been reported (see for example, Bechtel et al., 1973a; Bechtel et al., 1973b; Chmutova et al., 2001; Wardell et al., 2007; Gallardo et al., 2009; Ding & Zhao, 2010) . In continuation of recent studies (Wardell et al., 2012) , herein, the isolation the title compound [i.e. form IIc ( Fig. 1) ] from the reaction between PhNHNH 2 and PhCOCH 2 CO 2 Et in EtOH is described as is its crystal structure. The same tautomer was also isolated in the reaction between PhNHNH 2 and PhCOCH 2 CONHPh in EtOH.\n\nIn the title compound, Fig. 2 , crystallography proves the IIc tautomer in the solid-state. The pyrazole ring is planar with a r.m.s. deviation for the fitted atoms of 0.018 \u00c5; the maximum deviations from this plane are 0.015 (1) \u00c5 (for the N1 atom) and -0.015 (1) \u00c5 (C8). The N-and C-bound benzene rings are inclined to this plane forming dihedral angles of 21.45 (10) and 6.96 (10)\u00b0, respectively; the dihedral angle between the benzene rings is 20.42 (10)\u00b0 consistent with a nonplanar molecule.\n\nIn the crystal structure, supramolecular layers are formed in the bc plane through C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O and C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N interactions, Fig. 3 and Table 1 .

Layers are connected into double layers by C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0, Table 1 , and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions formed between the pyrazole and C-bound benzene rings [ring centroid\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7centroid distance = 3.6476 (12) \u00c5, angle of inclination of 6.96 (10)\u00b0 for symmetry operation 1 -x, 1 -y, 2 -z]. The double layers stack along the a axis being connected by \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions between the N-and C-bound benzene rings [ring centroid\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7centroid distance = 3.7718 (12) \u00c5, angle of inclination of 21.45 (10)\u00b0 for symmetry operation -x, 1 -y, 1 -z].\n\nA solution of PhNHNH 2 (1 mmol) and PhCOCH 2 CO 2 Et (1 mmol) in EtOH (15 ml) was refluxed for 1 h. The reaction mixture was maintained at room temperature and crystals of the titled compound were collected after 2 days, M.pt: 408-410 K: lit. value 409-411 K (Kimata et al., 2007) . IR and NMR spectra are in agreement with published data (Castagnolo \n\nThe C-bound H atoms were geometrically placed (C-H = 0.95-0.99 \u00c5) and refined as riding with U iso (H) = 1.2U eq (C).\n\nOwing to poor agreement one reflection, i.e. (3 1 1) , was removed from the final cycles of refinement. The maximum and minimum residual electron density peaks of 0.74 and 0.20 e \u00c5 -3 , respectively, were located 1.02 \u00c5 and 0.58 \u00c5 from the H8a and O1 atoms, respectively.\n\nData collection: COLLECT (Hooft, 1998) ; cell refinement: DENZO (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997) and COLLECT (Hooft, 1998) ; data reduction: DENZO (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997) and COLLECT (Hooft, 1998) ; program(s) used to solve structure: SHELXS97 (Sheldrick, 2008) ; program(s) used to refine structure: SHELXL97 (Sheldrick, 2008) ; molecular graphics: ORTEP-3 (Farrugia, 1997) and DIAMOND (Brandenburg, 2006) ; software used to prepare material for publication: publCIF (Westrip, 2010) .

All s.u.'s (except the s.u. in the dihedral angle between two l.s. planes) are estimated using the full covariance matrix. The cell s.u.'s are taken into account individually in the estimation of s.u.'s in distances, angles and torsion angles; correlations between s.u.'s in cell parameters are only used when they are defined by crystal symmetry. An approximate (isotropic) treatment of cell s.u.'s is used for estimating s.u.'s involving l.s. planes. Refinement. Refinement of F 2 against ALL reflections. The weighted R-factor wR and goodness of fit S are based on F 2 , conventional R-factors R are based on F, with F set to zero for negative F 2 . The threshold expression of F 2 > 2\u03c3(F 2 ) is used only for calculating R-factors(gt) etc. and is not relevant to the choice of reflections for refinement. R-factors based on F 2 are statistically about twice as large as those based on F, and R-factors based on ALL data will be even larger.\n\nx y z U iso */U eq O1 0.22694 ( (9) 0.0201 (9) \u22120.0037 (6) 0.0061 (7) 0.0006 (7) C2 0.0271 (9) 0.0236 (9) 0.0244 (9) \u22120.0011 (7) 0.0113 (7) 0.0003 (7) (7) C5 0.0235 (9) 0.0233 (9) 0.0294 (10) \u22120.0014 (7) 0.0053 (7) 0.0042 (7) C6 0.0216 (9) 0.0230 (9) 0.0243 (9) \u22120.0013 (7) 0.0086 (7) \u22120.0014 (7) C7 0.0217 (9) 0.0170 (8) 0.0221 (9) \u22120.0005 (7) 0.0099 (7) \u22120.0007 (7) C8 0.0231 (9) 0.0174 (9) 0.0207 (8) 0.0006 (7) 0.0094 (7) 0.0010 (7) C9 0.0170 (8) 0.0201 (9) 0.0195 (8) 0.0000 (6) 0.0079 (7) 0.0015 (7) C10 0.0191 (8) 0.0230 (9) 0.0214 (9) \u22120.0013 (7) 0.0106 (7) 0.0000 (7) C11 0.0214 (9) 0.0241 (9) 0.0233 (9) 0.0026 (7) 0.0086 (7) 0.0018 (7) C12 0.0272 (9) 0.0235 (9) 0.0294 (10) 0.0012 (7) 0.0140 (8) \u22120.0040 (7) C13 0.0286 (10) 0.0316 (11) 0.0217 (9) \u22120.0024 (8) 0.0108 (8) \u22120.0062 (7) C14 0.0273 (10) 0.0305 (10) 0.0199 (9) 0.0018 (8) 0.0093 (7) 0.0035 (7) C15 0.0257 (9) 0.0205 (9) 0.0232 (9) 0.0012 (7) 0.0120 (7) 0.0016 (7) Geometric parameters (\u00c5, \u00ba) Symmetry codes: (i) x, \u2212y+1/2, z+1/2; (ii) x, \u2212y+3/2, z+1/2; (iii) \u2212x+1, \u2212y+1, \u2212z+2."}
