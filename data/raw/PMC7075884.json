{"title": "Ginkgolic acid inhibits fusion of enveloped viruses", "body": "Ginkgolic acids are alkylphenol constituents of the leaves and fruits of Ginkgo biloba. Ginkgo biloba extracts (GBE) have been used as herbal supplements since at least the 16th century and remain widely in use1. Major constituents of GBE include terpine trilactones (ginkgolide A, B, C, J, and bilobalide), flavonoid glycosides (quercetin and rutin), as well as Ginkgolic acids2. Ginkgolic acids are a mixture of several 2-hydroxy-6-alkylbenzoic acids in which the most common alkyl chains contain 13, 15, or 17 carbons. The 15 and 17 carbon chains are unsaturated at positions 8 and 10, respectively. The 3 Ginkgolic acid (GA) structures are, therefore, designated C13:0, C15:1, and C17:1 (Table S1)3.\n\nGA has shown pleiotropic effects in vitro, including: antitumor effects through inhibition of lipogenesis; decreased expression of invasion associated proteins through AMPK activation; potential rescue of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) induced synaptic impairment; and inhibition of HIV protease activity as well as HIV viral replication4\u20137. GA was also reported to have activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus8. Several ways in which GA works have been suggested including by SUMOylation inhibition activity; blocking formation of the E1-SUMO intermediate9; inhibition of fatty acid synthase10; non-specific SIRT inhibition11; and activation of protein phosphatase type-2C12.\n\nHere we report that GA shows antiviral activity against Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) primarily through viral fusion inhibition. In addition, we show inhibition of entry of a replication-defective non-enveloped adenovirus. The antiviral effects were observed below the cytotoxic threshold. We believe that broad spectrum antiviral activity is achieved through the inhibition of viral entry and that this effect could be therapeutically utilized systemically in the context of severe acute viral disease, or topically for the treatment of cutaneous viral lesions. We show a broad spectrum of fusion inhibition by GA of all three classes of fusion proteins13 including: pathogenic human enveloped viruses from Class I (ZIKV, HIV, EBOV, and influenza A virus (IAV)), Class II (Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) and Semliki Forest virus (SFV)), and Class III (vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Epstein Barr virus (EBV)). Taken together, our experiments suggest that GA inhibits viral entry by blocking the initial fusion event.\n\nThe toxicity EC50 of GA on HEp-2 cells in MEM supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was 27.63 \u00b1 2.21 \u03bcM (Fig. S1A) or 63.5 \u00b1 3.2 \u03bcM (Fig. S1B) on cells supplemented with 5% FBS. In cells infected with HCMV strain CH19 and supplemented with 1% FBS, the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 6.83 \u00b1 1.08 \u03bcM, and with 10% bovine serum, the IC50 of GA was 41 \u03bcM (Fig. 1A). The toxicity EC50 of GA on HFF cells was 14.00 \u03bcM \u00b1 0.1 in MEM medium supplemented with 1% FBS (Fig. S1C), and 137.04 \u03bcM \u00b1 10.44 (Fig. S1D) in MEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS. The results indicated that the activity and toxicity of GA is affected by the serum concentration in the medium (see discussion).\n\nTo assess the effect of GA on HCMV infection, dilutions of 1 \u00b5M to 20 \u00b5M were made (Fig. 1A). Monolayers of human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) were incubated for 1 hour with GA and then infected with two cell-associated clinical isolates of HCMV: CH1914 and BI-615. Because neither virus produces extracellular virus, plates for plaque assays were inoculated with 50\u2013100 infected cells per well, and then treated with medium containing 1\u201320 \u00b5M GA, or vehicle control. Viral infection was allowed to progress for 7 days, and then quantitated by plaque reduction assay14. GA inhibited infection of BI-6 and CH19 with an IC50 of 7.26 \u00b1 0.92 \u03bcM and 6.83 \u00b1 1.08 \u03bcM, respectively.\n\nTo further assess the effect of GA on plaque formation, we used the CMVPT30-GFP strain, which produces cell-free virions. HFF monolayers in 24-well plates pretreated with GA (1\u201320 \u00b5M) for 1 h were inoculated with 50\u2013100 plaque-forming units of CMVPT30-GFP per well.16, (Fig. 1B). The number of plaques were counted after 7 days and the IC50 was determined. As predicted by the previously-determined IC50, at 5 and at 10 \u00b5M the antiviral effect was apparent. Furthermore, at 10 \u00b5M, only single cells were infected, indicating that there was no cell-to-cell virus transmission. These results may be explained as inhibition of secondary infections or that viral entry may be a target of GA. To verify these results, we compared the inhibition of infection by GA using a plaque reduction assay (PRA) similar to the PRA for ganciclovir (GCV), the preferred antiviral HCMV drug of choice. The results showed that although there was strong inhibition of the virus at 16 \u00b5M GCV, there were still visible plaques (>5 adjacent cells showing HCMV cytopathic effect) indicating cell-to-cell transmission of the virions. On the contrary, CMVPT30-GFP infected monolayers that were treated with 10 \u00b5M GA only displayed individual infected cells in intact HFF monolayers, (Fig. 1C), thus indicating no cell-cell transmission. We also tested GA C17:1 and GA C13:0. Both GA compounds had a strong inhibitory effect on HCMV infection by PRA, similar to GA C15:1 (Fig. 1D,E). None of the GA structures showed cytotoxicity at their active concentrations, respectively.\n\nWe tested GA on HSV-1, a rapidly replicating and lytic DNA virus, and on ZIKV, an RNA virus which has neither glycoprotein conservation nor common receptors with HCMV or HSV-1. To test whether GA inhibits HSV-1, we designed an experiment to test the direct effect of GA on the virus. For this experiment, we used HEp-2 and 293T cells. 1 \u00d7 107 PFU HSV-1 strain F was treated for 1 hour with GA (50 \u00b5M) or with vehicle in serum free DMEM and then each of these were used to infect HEp2 or 293T cells at an MOI of 0.5 in 199V medium with a final concentration of 2.5 \u00b5M GA. As a control, the virus that was originally treated with the vehicle was then supplemented also with 2.5 \u00b5M GA. To test for successful viral infection of HEp2 and 293T cells, production of HSV-1 immediate early (ICP27), early (ICP8), and late (US11) proteins was analyzed by Western Blot (Fig. 2A,B). The results showed that in the treated HSV-1 F stock there was complete inhibition of viral replication, as indicated by lack of protein synthesis. This implies that viral entry may be a target of GA, because direct treatment of HSV-1 with GA blocks downstream HSV-1 protein production. To test the effect of GA on HSV-1 replication, HEp2 cell monolayers were grown to 90% confluency in a 6-well plate, treated with 10 \u00b5M GA C15:1 or vehicle for 1 hour in 199V medium, and then inoculated with HSV-1 strain F for protein analysis. HSV-1 ICP27, ICP8, and US11 proteins were detected by Western Blot (Fig. 2C). The results showed profound inhibition of immediate early, early, and late viral proteins. The inhibition of the full temporal range of HSV-1 proteins implies that inhibition of viral replication occurs by blocking the entry of virions into the target cell. To evaluate the effect of GA on progeny virions, the supernatant of GFP-HSV-1 strain 17+ infected Vero cells at an MOI of 1 was collected after 20 h and titered by plaque reduction assay (Fig. 2D). The results showed a significant decrease of approximately 2 log in the GA-treated cell titers.\n\nTo test the effect of GA on ZIKV infection, NHA were grown to 90% confluency in a 24-well plate, treated with GA or DMSO for 3 hours without serum and then infected with ZIKV strain PRVABC59 at an MOI of 0.3. The next day, supernatant was replaced with fresh medium containing GA or DMSO and cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2. On day 7, viability was determined with the MTS Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega), and then these cells were harvested to extract total RNA for quantification of ZIKV RNA by Taqman based qRT-PCR. The results showed 70% to 80% viability at 5 \u00b5M to 20 \u00b5M GA, compared to less than 40% viability for the vehicle-treated cells. Furthermore, an 80\u201390% decrease in ZIKV RNA was observed at 5 \u00b5M to 20 \u00b5M GA (Fig. 3A,B). We concluded that GA inhibits entry of Zika virions and prevents NHA cell death. This suggests that the mechanism of inhibition that appears to be targeted in HSV and HCMV by GA is conserved among enveloped viruses that have no homologous glycoproteins and use different cell receptors for entry. To test the direct effect of GA on ZIKV, 5 \u00d7 105 PFU ZIKV were treated for 1 hour with GA (10 \u00b5M/ml) or with vehicle in 199V medium, and then were used to infect Vero cells at an MOI of 0.5. Supernatant was collected at 4, 24 and 48 hours post-inoculation for cell free viral RNA copy number determination (Fig. 3C). The results indicated that the GA-treated ZIKV was completely inhibited, as indicated by cell free ZIKV RNA copy number. This suggests that viral entry of ZIKV, may be a target of GA because direct treatment of ZIKV with GA blocks downstream ZIKV RNA production.\n\nTo assess the effect of GA on non-enveloped virus, we also tested its antiviral activity on adenovirus, which is internalized by endocytosis. Monolayers of Vero cells were incubated for 1 hour with medium containing 10 \u00b5M GA C15:1 or DMSO vehicle. The cells then were inoculated with a replication-defective human adenovirus type 5 (dE1/E3) containing GFP (Ad-GFP) or GFP-HSV-1 virus, at an MOI of 0.5 in a medium containing 10 \u00b5M GA C15:1 for 24 hours. The inoculated Vero cells were evaluated by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4). The results showed significant HSV-1 inhibition, as well as inhibition of entry of the adenovirus.\n\nOur data suggested that GA targets virus-cell fusion. To assess the activity of GA C15:1 on virus-cell fusion we modeled virus-cell fusion by the fusion of cells expressing viral fusion proteins to target cells. Cell-cell fusion was monitored by the spread of fluorescent dyes. Based on crystallographically identified three-dimensional structures, the folds of all virus fusion proteins fall into one of three classes. Effector COS7 cells were transfected to express all three classes of fusion proteins (Table S2), including ZIKV, HIV, EBOV, IAV, SFV, VEEV, VSV and EBV.\n\nThe COS7 cells were loaded with calcein AM and bound to 293T target cells that were either unlabeled or, for purposes of microscopic identification, loaded with the aqueous dye CMAC, as illustrated for EBOV GP-induced fusion (Fig. 5A). We tested the effect of adding GA on cell-cell fusion mediated by four class I, two class II, and two class III fusion proteins. For all eight proteins, 10 \u00b5M GA C15:1 completely blocked fusion (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, when EBOV GP was treated with 5 \u00b5M or with 10 \u00b5M GA C13:0, GA C15:1, or GA C17:1 (Fig. 5C), 10 \u00b5M of all GA derivatives completely blocked fusion.\n\nWhen GA was removed, fusion was restored (Fig. 6A, Bar 4), indicating that GA interferes with fusion in a reversible manner. Viral fusion, regardless of fusion protein, proceeds through the creation of hemifusion, an intermediate state in which proximal lipid monolayer leaflets of membranes, in contact with one another, have merged, but the distal monolayers remain distinct. Because inhibition of fusion was universal, independent of viral protein, it is extremely unlikely that GA targeted the fusion proteins themselves. This is consistent with GA inhibiting the creation of the hemifusion intermediate, and universal inhibition would be expected. It is well known that agents conferring positive spontaneous curvature, such as lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), inhibit fusion induced by viral and non-viral fusion proteins17. Likewise, the cone-shaped lipid oleic acid (OA) has a negative spontaneous membrane curvature, which favors hemifusion when present in the outer bilayer, and its presence relieves the inhibition of fusion18. The addition of OA together with GA abolished the inhibitory effect of GA (Fig. 6B), indicating that GA induces positive membrane curvature.\n\nTo validate the PRA observations, we tested whether there is an effect on downstream viral DNA synthesis in HCMV infected cells when treated with GA. HFF were inoculated with HCMV for 3 hours, then washed and incubated with different concentrations of GA or vehicle. DNA was extracted from 4 pooled wells of HFF at 7 days post inoculation, and then analyzed by qPCR targeting the viral polymerase gene. DNA copies were reduced in a dose dependent manner by the addition of GA to culture medium (Fig. 7A). Although HCMV DNA copy numbers were reduced by GA, this could be secondary to inhibition of virus entry rather than direct inhibition of DNA replication.\n\nViral protein synthesis was determined in HSV-infected cells following GA treatment. Untreated HEp-2 and 293T cells were infected with HSV-1 F\u2019 at an MOI of 1 for 2 hours, allowing the virions to internalize into the cells, then washed with 199V medium and supplemented with 10 \u00b5M GA or vehicle. The viral replication was evaluated by Western Blot detection of HSV-1 proteins. Although the infection of HEp-2 and 293T cells had been initiated, the addition of 10 \u00b5M GA to the infected HEp-2 and 293T cells inhibited the virus replication from the point of exposure to GA (Fig. 7B,C). The observed effect could be the result of inhibition of secondary infections. However, the early down regulation of HSV proteins, occurring prior to a complete viral replication cycle, suggests that there could be a secondary inhibitory mechanism targeting viral protein synthesis.\n\nThe Ginkgolic acids C13:0, C15:1 and C17:1 are commercially available compounds of Ginkgo leaves. The antioxidative activity of GA has been reported to have multiple therapeutic effects including the treatment of cardiovascular disease, HIV infection, bacterial infections such as Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, and some tumors7,8,19,20. It has been suggested that GA may operate by several other pathways including: inhibition of fatty acid synthase10; non-specific SIRT inhibition11; activation of protein phosphatase type-2C12; suppression of STAT3 activation through induction of PTEN and SHP-1 Tyrosine Phosphatase21, and protection against A\u03b2-induced synaptic dysfunction in the hippocampus6.\n\nIn this study, we are the first to report the fusion inhibitory effect of GA on enveloped viruses representing the three classes of fusion proteins and the inhibition of a non-enveloped human adenovirus. We also report a potential secondary mechanism of action involving viral DNA and protein synthesis. Our results are consistent with previous reports of the inhibitory effect of GA on DNA and protein synthesis22. The mechanism of action through which GA affects DNA and protein synthesis is not yet understood. It may bind to the host cell receptors and activate different cell signaling pathways and/or cause cell cycle arrest, which may explain the inhibitory effect of GA on rapidly dividing cancer cells. It may also enter the cells and work directly on DNA and protein synthesis. Experiments to address these questions are ongoing.\n\nTo assess the effect of GA on infectious viruses, we performed GA dose-response experiments. The cells were treated with different GA concentrations ranging between 1 \u00b5M and 20 \u00b5M. We demonstrated a dose dependent effect of GA on HCMV, HSV-1, and ZIKV. The effect of GA was tested in several cell types including HEp-2 (human epithelial carcinoma), 293T (human embryonic kidney), HFF and NHA (normal human astrocytes). GA was shown to have a viral inhibitory effect in all of the tested cells with no cytotoxicity within the active inhibitory range.\n\nBerg et al. evaluated the cytotoxicity and mutagenicity of GA in male Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (V79 cells)23. Their results showed toxicity on cells grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS after 24 hours in GA concentrations above 50 \u00b5M, with no mutagenic effect. Ahlemeyer et al. reported that 500 \u00b5M GA induced neuronal death and activated protein phosphatase type-2C in chick embryonic neurons growing in DMEM with 20% FBS12. B.M Hausen, evaluated the sensitizing capacity of GA in guinea pigs, determining 1000 ppm (2.886 mM) GA as safe to avoid inducing an allergic reaction24. Viral infections of permissive cells are regularly performed in 199 or MEM medium supplemented with 1% or 2% FBS. However, when we tested the activity and toxicity of GA on the cells used in our research, we also incubated the cells with GA in the cells\u2019 recommended growth medium (see results and Fig. S1). The results indicated that the activity and toxicity of GA is affected by the serum concentration in the medium. We concluded that GA interacts with serum factors, which lowers its antiviral activity, and researchers using GA should address this issue in future experiments. In vivo experiments in an animal model are needed to assess the actual therapeutic antiviral effect and cytotoxicity of GA.\n\nGA\u2019s universal inhibition of viral protein-mediated cell-cell fusion indicates that its inhibitory effect is by a common fusion mechanism. LPC also universally blocks membrane fusion; it does so by conferring spontaneous positive curvature, which prevents hemifusion. This block can be relieved, regardless of fusion protein, by the addition of the negative spontaneous curvature agent OA25,26. The finding that OA relieves the GA-induced inhibition of EBOV GP-mediated fusion implies that, similar to LPC, GA acts by producing positive spontaneous curvature and this prevents hemifusion. A number of rigid amphipathic fusion inhibitors (RAFI) with positive spontaneous curvature have been shown to inhibit fusion induced by unrelated viral fusion proteins27. In the future, it would be interesting to measure the values of the spontaneous curvatures of GA and RAFI and to relate them to the concentration of OA necessary to relieve fusion inhibition. For the inhibition of non-enveloped adenovirus, we suggest that since GA affects lipid bilayer curvature, it would be predicted to affect the endocytic entry of a non-enveloped virus such as adenovirus. In addition, as we report here, GA appears to have potential secondary mechanisms of viral DNA and protein synthesis inhibition, and these would be predicted to be targeted in both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown a consistent inhibitory effect of GA on the fusion of a variety of enveloped viruses, including important pathogens such as EBOV, HIV, ZIKA, HSV-1, HCMV, EBV and IAV. We also have shown inhibition of a non-enveloped human adenovirus, which suggests a potential inhibitory effect on other non-enveloped viruses. Furthermore, we found that GA might possibly inhibit HCMV viral DNA and HSV-1 protein synthesis by a secondary mechanism.\n\nThus, in light of the antiviral effect of GA on established viral infections of permissive cells, GA potentially could be used to treat acute viral infections (e.g. Coronavirus (COVID-19), EBOV, ZIKV, IAV and measles), and it might be determined to be useful in topical application for the successful treatment of active lesions (e.g. HSV-1, HSV-2 and VZV). Finally, our approach for GA usage to inhibit enveloped virus infection is fundamentally different from traditional microbicidal strategies that target virus genome replication. We anticipate that it could complement other direct antiviral agents and offer a new class of inhibitors of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses.\n\nHEp2 cells, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC Rockville, MD), were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). HEK293T/17 (293T) cells obtained from the ATCC were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. HSV-1 strain F, a limited-passage isolate, is the prototype strain used in this laboratory28. GFP-HSV-1 (strain 17), was a generous gift from Dr. Peter O\u2019Hare29. Vero cells obtained from the ATCC were cultured in complete DMEM (cDMEM) containing 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin, and 10 mM Hepes buffer at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. Fetal-derived Normal Human Astrocytes (NHA, Lonza) were maintained in Astrocyte Growth Medium (AGM, Lonza) supplemented with 0.3% FBS, 30 \u00b5l/mL ascorbic acid, 1 \u00b5l/mL rhEGF, 30 \u00b5g/mL gentamicin, 15 \u03bcg/mL amphotericin B, 2.5 \u00b5l/mL insulin, and 10 \u00b5l/mL L-glutamine. Early passages (1\u20134) were used in these experiments.\n\nHCMV studies were performed using cell-associated low-passage clinical isolates CH1914 and BI-615. CH19 is resistant to the first-line HCMV antiviral drug, ganciclovir (GCV), while BI-6 is susceptible to GCV. Additional experiments were performed using CMVPT30-GFP16, which expresses green fluorescent protein and produces extracellular virus.\n\nZIKV strain PRVABC59 obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA) was propagated in Vero cells grown in T-150 flasks by infection at 1:50 dilution of viral stock (MOI 0.25) in the absence of FBS. The medium was removed and replaced 6 h post-infection (hpi) with fresh cDMEM. Supernatant was collected at 72 hpi, clarified by centrifugation at 350 \u00d7 g for 5 min, and filtered through a 0.45-\u03bcm surfactant-free cellulose acetate membrane. For mock infections, supernatant was collected from uninfected Vero cells and prepared by the same protocol used to make virus stocks. Virus was titered by focus assay. Briefly, infected Vero cells, 24 hpi were fixed and permeabilized using Cytofix/Cytoperm Solution Kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and stained with a mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for flavivirus group envelope proteins (1:250; EMD Millipore; clone D1\u20134G2-4-15) followed by incubation with an anti-mouse IgG - PE (1:1000 dilution). Samples were run through an LSR II flow cytometer and data were collected with FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo Software (TreeStar). Human Adenovirus Type5 (dE1/E3), Cat. No.: 1060, was purchased from Vector Biolabs.\n\nGA C13:0, C15:1, and C17:1, were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO. GA was diluted in methanol or DMSO to a concentration of 50 mM. Effects of GA in all assays and models used in this study have been compared to vehicle-treated (i.e. methanol or DMSO) controls. Cells or viral stocks were treated with the indicated concentration of GA.\n\nFor HSV-1, cells were harvested at the indicated times, collected by low-speed centrifugation and rinsed in PBS, then resuspended in RIPA lysis buffer and protease inhibitors (Complete Protease Inhibitor; Roche). Approximately 60 \u03bcg of protein per sample was subjected to further analysis. Proteins were electrophoretically separated on 8 to 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, electrically transferred to nitrocellulose sheets, blocked by 5% BSA in Tween PBS and reacted with the primary antibodies. The mouse monoclonal antibody to US11 (Goodwin Institute for Cancer Research), and the mouse monoclonal antibody to ICP8, were used at a dilution of 1:1,000. The mouse monoclonal antibody to ICP27 was used at a dilution of 1:250. The mouse monoclonal antibody to \u03b2-actin (Sigma) was used at a 1:5,000 dilution. Membranes were then reacted with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated either to alkaline phosphatase or to horseradish peroxidase. Protein bands were visualized with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate\u2013nitroblue tetrazolium (Denville Scientific, Inc.) or with ECL Western Blot detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction.\n\nCells grown in 96 or 48 well plates were exposed to different concentrations of GA for 24 h. Cell viability was determined by Alamarblue\u00ae assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog number: DAL1025). Pair-wise Student t-tests were used to compare the outcome of a treatment as compared to the control. Error bars are SEM (n \u2265 3).\n\nConfluent Vero cells in 75-cm2 flasks were infected with HSV in 3 ml of 199V (Gibco; 199 medium supplemented with 1% heat-inactivated FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) medium at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 pfu/cell and incubated by gentle shaking for 2 hours at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 to allow cells to absorb the virus. After 2 hours, 199 V was aspirated from the cell culture and Vero cells were gently washed with DPBS. 3 ml of fresh DMEM/5% FBS medium was added and the cells were incubated for 2 to 3 days until 100% of the cells display cytopathic effect (CPE). When 100% CPE was observed, the flask was placed at \u221280 \u00b0C for 15 min, then allowed to warm up at room temperature and 3 ml of cold sterile milk was added. The cells were collected into a 15 ml tube and kept on ice. To free virus particles from the cellular debris, Vero cells were sonicated three times (letting the cell suspension cool on ice for 1 min between sonications), for 30 seconds using a Branson Sonifier with microtip at an output setting of 4 (approximate Power Output of 15%). The virus stock was aliquoted and transferred to sterile, screw-capped cryovials and was stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. The viral titer was determined by plaque assay.\n\nGA (10 \u00b5M) was incubated on the monolayers of Vero cells (6-well plate) with 199V (Gibco; supplemented with 1% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) at 37 \u00b0C for 1 hour prior to inoculation. Following incubation, the supernatants were aspirated and cells were washed two times with DPBS. GFP-HSV-1 strain 17+29, at an MOI of 1 was incubated on the cells with 199V at 37 \u00b0C for 24 hours. The supernatant was collected and titered. Various 10-fold dilutions of collected supernatants were incubated on monolayers of fresh Vero cells (6-well plate) at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker for 2 h to allow the virus to attach and enter the cells. The supernatants were aspirated and cells were incubated with 20 mg/mL of human serum (Sigma-H4522) in DMEM (Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s medium, supplemented with 5% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) for 3 days at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2 to allow plaque formation. For plaque counting, the cells were fixed with 100% methanol for 5 min. at room temperature and stained with 10% KaryoMax Giemsa stain in distilled water for 20 min. at room temperature. Viral titer was calculated through plaque counting and expressed as plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml.\n\nCell free ZIKV in 199V medium was pretreated with 10 \u00b5M/ml GA or with DMSO for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C. The pretreated ZIKV was used to infect Vero cells grown in 6 well plates >80% confluency with 0.5 MOI for 1 hour. The infected cells were washed twice with warm DPBS and supplemented with DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS. Supernatant was collected at 4, 24 and 48 hours post-inoculation for cell-free viral RNA copy number determination. NHA were grown in 24 well plates to >80% confluency, treated with GA C15:1 (0\u201320 \u00b5M) for 3 h, and then infected with ZIKV at an MOI of 0.3. Supernatant was carefully removed and replaced at 12 hpi with fresh AGM replenished with GA at 0\u201320 \u00b5M concentrations. Cell viability was assessed at 7 days post-inoculation by Celltiter Aqueous One solution cell proliferation assay (Promega, Madison, WI), and live cells were carefully harvested to extract RNA by the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). RNA was quantified using a Nanodrop2000 (ThermoFisher), treated with DNaseI (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min at room temperature to remove DNA contamination, and subsequently, DNaseI was inactivated by heating at 70 \u00b0C for 15 min. cDNA was synthesized from 0.2\u20131 \u03bcg of RNA using Qscript supermix (Quanta Biosciences). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) reactions were performed in a 20 \u03bcl solution containing 10 \u03bcl TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix (Life Technologies), 500 nM primers, and 300 nM probe. Reactions were performed in an Applied Biosystems 7900HT sequence detection system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using SDS2.3 software. The reaction conditions were, 50 \u00b0C for 2 min, 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and 60 \u00b0C for 1 min. Samples were run in duplicate or triplicates, and template controls were included wherever necessary. Fold change in RNA expression was calculated by relative quantification using the comparative CT method with GAPDH as endogenous control. The primers and probe were designed using the PrimerQuest tool (Integrated DNA Technologies). The sequences of the primers were as follows:\n\nZIKV-F-CGCTGCCCAACACAAGGT; ZIKV-R-, GCTCCCTTTGCCAAAAAGTCCACA, and ZIKV-probe, 5\u2032/56-FAM/ACCTTGACA/ZEN/AGCAGTCAGACACTCAA/3IABkFQ; and human specific GAPDH-F-GGTGTGAACCATGAGAAGTATGA; GAPDH-R-GAGTCCTTCCACGATACCAAAG; and GAPDH-probe, 5\u2032/56-FAM/AGATCATCA/ZEN/GCAATGCCTCCTGCA/3IABkFQ.\n\nHFF were grown in 24 well plates to 100% confluency in MEM with 10% FBS to establish viral inhibition of two low-passage clinical strains (BI-6 and CH19) via plaque assay. Cells infected with low-passage HCMV clinical strains (CH19 and BI6) do not release extracellular virus, but they display typical HCMV cytopathic effect (CPE). The percentage of infected cells was estimated visually in HFF monolayers. Dilutions of trypsinized cells were used as inocula for HFF monolayers in 24 well plates. After 7 days in culture, plaques were counted to determine the average number of plaques in 4-well replicates of each dilution. The optimal dilution for each virus strain produced an average of 60\u201380 plaques per well. CMVPT30-GFP having undergone multiple passages produces extracellular virus. Viral infection was quantitatively determined by PRA of culture supernatant medium. Cells were either exposed to GA for three hours prior to inoculation, or were inoculated prior to addition of medium containing GA at concentrations of 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 \u00b5M in MEM with 1% FBS. One set of four wells was treated with DMSO as a vehicle control. For each experiment the remaining concentrations were represented in quadruplicate wells. Plates were read beginning at 7 days post inoculation (dpi) to determine the GA concentration producing a reduction of 50% in the number of plaques relative to vehicle control wells (IC50). Data were normalized to the vehicle controls, and probit analysis in SPSS was used to obtain 95% confidence intervals of the mean IC50 values.\n\nHCMV infected monolayers were trypsinized and pooled at the termination of the PRA. DNA was extracted from the pooled monolayers using the Blood gDNA kit (Promega, Madison, WI). HCMV DNA was quantitated using a validated in-house assay, which targets the DNA polymerase30. Reactions were performed on an Applied Biosystems 7500 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\n\nMonolayers of Vero cells were incubated for 1 hour with medium containing 10 \u00b5M GA C15:1 or DMSO vehicle. The cells then were inoculated with a replication-defective human adenovirus type 5 (dE1/E3) containing GFP (Ad-GFP) or GFP-HSV-1 virus, at an MOI of 0.5 in a medium containing 10 \u00b5M GA C15:1 for 24 hours. Infection was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy.\n\nIn these experiments, we used cell-cell fusion systems of ZIKV, HIV, EBOV, IVA, VEEV, VSV, SFV and EBV. The plasmids, fusion proteins, and the related references are described in Table S2.\n\nNucleated cell-cell fusion, experiments were performed as described31,32. Calcein-AM was loaded into effector cells expressing the fusion protein, and 7-amino-4-chloromethylcoumarin (CMAC) was loaded into target cells. Mixing of dyes was scored as fusion. Fusion experiments for each viral protein were performed as previously described: EBOV GP32; HIV33; SFV E1/E2 and IAV HA34; VEEV E, VSV, and EBV35. Unless stated otherwise, EBOV GP was used as the fusion protein and C15:1 GA was used to inhibit fusion. As shown in Fig. 2B, C15:1 GA inhibited fusion for the eight tested fusion proteins. Figure 2C documents that fusion was blockaded by GA C13:0, C15:1, or C17:1.\n\nFor HCMV plaque assays, data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA analysis in SPSS. For BI6 n = 25; degrees of freedom between groups = 4 and within groups = 20. The F value is 68.827. For CH19 n = 24; degrees of freedom between groups = 4 and within groups = 19. The F value is 41.090.\n\nFor fusion experiments, Pair-wise Student t-tests were used to compare the outcome of a manipulation on fusion as compared to the control. Error bars are SEM (n \u2265 3).\n\nHCMV DNA copy numbers expressed as percent of control. Significance was set at P < 0.05. P values were obtained using a two-tailed t-test. All measurements were performed in duplicate. Standard curves were included on each run.\n\nFor ZIKV, the data were analyzed using unpaired, two tailed student\u2019s t test and represented as mean\u00b1 standard error. Experiments were done independently at least three times and a value of p \u2264 0.05 indicated a statistically significant difference."}
