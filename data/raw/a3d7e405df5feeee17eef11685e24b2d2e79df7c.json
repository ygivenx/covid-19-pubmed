{"title": "Catalytic Stereoselective Synthesis of Diverse Oxindoles and Spirooxindoles from Isatins", "body": "Complex functionalized molecules are important compounds of interest for biological probes and as new molecules for pharmaceutical lead discovery. Oxindole and spirooxindole scaffolds have generated considerable synthetic interest due to their occurrence in diverse natural products and notable biological activity. 1 In a recent discovery, spiroindolone NITD609 demonstrated nanomolar activity as a therapeutic agent that kills the blood stage of Plasmodium falciparum and has single-dose efficacy in a rodent malaria model ( Figure  1 ). 2 Various hydroxy-oxindoles scaffolds also demonstrate important biological activity, such as Convolutamydine A, a natural product with potent activity against leukemia cells. 3 Substituted isatin (indole-2,3-diones) scaffolds have also shown promising examples of biological activity. 4 For example, isatin 1 is a potent inhibitor of SARS CoV 3C-like proteases. 5 Initially driven by efficient synthetic methods, the 1,2,3-triazole has now emerged as a heterocycle of biological interest in drug discovery and medicinal chemistry programs. 7 For example, triazole 2 shows activity against tuberculosis strain H37RV. 6 The significant biological activities observed for oxindoles and triazoles emphasizes the need to develop efficient synthetic strategies to access these scaffolds and increase structural diversity for drug discovery and medicinal chemistry programs.\n\nPrevious work from our laboratory has demonstrated several methods of catalytic activation of the isatin dicarbonyl for efficient and selective nucleophilic additions and spirocyclizations at the 3-position. 8 The strategy we envisioned utilizes a common set of Npropargylated isatins 3 to access diverse oxindole scaffolds through a series of mechanistically-distinct nucleophilic addition pathways. Each resulting oxindole scaffold contains an alkyne group that provides further opportunities for structural diversification with triazole heterocycles using the copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction. We also envisioned that the N-propargylated isatins 3 would be directly utilized in the CuAAC reaction as a fifth scaffold because triazole-containing isatins have not previously been reported or evaluated for biological activity. Here we describe the realization of this strategy for rapid access (two synthetic steps) to a pilot-scale library of diverse triazole-containing hydroxy-oxindoles 4-6, spiroindolones 7, isatin-triazoles 8, and spirooxazolines 9-10 emanating from a common set of propargylated isatins 3 (Scheme 1). Overall, our two-step strategy affords a library of 64 oxindole and spirooxindole compounds, including 15 core scaffolds and 49 triazole derivatives. The efficient stereoselective syntheses of complex heterocycles combining both oxindole and triazole motifs have not been described previously. Based on the breadth of biological activity known for isatins, oxindoles and spirooxindoles, these densely functionalized heterocycles should serve as important biological probes for chemical biology.\n\nA key feature in this strategy is the regio-, diastereo-and enantioselective synthesis of the oxindole and spirooxindole scaffolds (Scheme 2). Based on the nucleophile component (11) utilized (Scheme 1), four oxindole scaffolds were selected for this library: hydroxyoxindoles 13-15 are prepared enantioselectively using a chiral Lewis acid catalyst (19) ; 8b spiroindolones 16 are prepared enantioselectively using a chiral Br\u00f6nsted acid catalyst (20) ; 8c and the 2-oxazoline and 3-oxazoline spirocycles 17 and 18 are each prepared diastereo-and regioselectively using a titanium(IV) Lewis acid catalyst (Scheme 2). 8a For some scaffolds, isatins (3) are selected based on substitution patterns that ensure high selectivity.\n\nFirst, a series of 3-substituted-3-hydroxy-oxindole scaffolds 13-15 were accessed using scandium(III)-catalyzed enantioselective additions with representative \u03c0-nucleophiles: Nmethylindole (11a), 2-methallylsilane (11b), and N,N-dimethyl-m-anisidine (11c) . 8b Scandium(III) complexes formed with the 2,6-bis[(3aS,8aR)-3a,8a-dihydro-8H-indeno[1,2d]oxazolin-2yl]pyridine ligand (e.g. 19) are known to be effective chiral Lewis acid catalysts with good chelating potential. 9 As outlined in Table 1 , isatins 3b-c were utilized to afford hydroxy oxindoles 13-15 with high yields (78-97%) and enantioselectivity (85-99% ee). All reactions were performed at room temperature, with the exception of entries 1 and 4, which were performed at \u221220 \u00b0C due to the high reactivity of the nucleophile. In the case of the methallylsilane (11b, entries 2 and 5), the reaction is run in acetonitrile with TMSCl and NaSbF 6 as additives to increase the efficiency of the reaction and promote in situ deprotection of any resulting OTMS product so that the hydroxy-oxindole products 13-15 are obtained exclusively. 10, 11 Using an asymmetric Pictet-Spengler-type spirocyclization reaction, 12 three spiroindolone scaffolds were prepared upon acid-catalyzed spirocyclization of 5-methoxytryptamine (11d) with isatins (Table 2 ). 8c, 13 We have previously shown that this reaction is efficiently catalyzed using Lewis acidic metal salts, thioureas, or BINOL-derived chiral phosphoric acids. The 5-fluorospiroindolone 16b was prepared using a BINOL-derived phosphoric acid catalyst to demonstrate the enantioselective synthesis and evaluate the retention of enantiomeric excess in the CuAAC reaction. Using (S)-3,3\u2032-bis(2,4,6triisopropylphenyl)-1,1\u2032-binaphthyl-2,2\u2032-diyl hydrogenphosphate (20) as the catalyst, fluorospiroindolone 16b was attained in excellent yield (86%) and high enantioselectivity (84% ee) ( Table 2 , entry 2). 11 Using either Sc(OTf) 3 or 1,3-bis(3,5bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)thiourea provides an efficient (and less expensive) catalyst for the preparation of racemic spiroindolones ( Table 2 , entries 1 and 3). Isatins 3b and 3f were selected due to the therapeutic relevance of fluorinated molecules as well as the efficient performance of these isatins in the Pictet-Spengler reaction. 2b, 14 A series of spirooxindole oxazoline scaffolds were prepared using the titanium(IV)catalyzed regio-and diastereoselective addition and spirocyclization of 5-methoxyoxazoles to isatins. 8a, 15 Substitution at the 4-position of the oxazole controls the regiochemistry, with the 4-isopropyloxazole (11f) giving rise to the 3-oxazoline scaffold 18 and the 4-H oxazole (11e) leading to the 2-oxazoline scaffold 17. 8a, 11, 16 In general, the oxazole addition to propargyl isatins 3a-d proceeded with high regioand diastereoselectivity (>99% rr, up to 99% dr) and in high yields (up to 95%); however, in two cases (17b and 18c) the isolated yield was low due to the presence of by-products that proved to be difficult to separate by column chromatography. All reactions proceeds with high diastereoselectivity, but the 4chloroisatin 3c is particularly effective for dictating high diastereoselectivity in the formation of 2-oxazolines, such as 17c.\n\nThis collection of diverse oxindole and spirooxindole scaffolds contains a common feature through the N-propargyl group of each scaffold, which can be further diversified using azide-alkyne cycloaddition chemistry. We set out to compare several variations of CuAAC reactions for this collection of N-propargylated oxindoles. We began by exploring one-pot reaction conditions that utilize in situ generated azides, prepared from the corresponding amine using the shelf-stable diazotransfer reagent 1H-imidazole-1-sulfonyl azide (21) (Scheme 3, eq 1). 17 Unfortunately, this method did not work for these oxindole substrates due to side reactions and decomposition of starting material under the diazo transfer conditions. Several solvent combinations (THF, MeOH/THF, DCM), copper reagents, and conditions (i.e. Cu(I) vs. Cu(II) reduction by sodium ascorbate in situ) were explored, but only minimal triazole formation was observed for the one-pot procedure. Next, we investigated a route utilizing in situ generated aryl azides prepared from commerciallyavailable aryl iodides with sodium azide in the presence of copper iodide (Scheme 3, eq 2). 18 This method was also considered to be attractive because it provides access to diverse aryl triazoles, including amino-substituted triazoles that are not available when preparing azides from amines. This method has previously only been reported for less-functionalized substrates, but here the conditions generally afforded low yields (33-40%) for the more complex oxindole substrates. Low yields are attributed to the formation of undesired polymericside products.\n\nUltimately, we utilized a method applicable for the synthesis of both alkyl-and arylsubstituted triazoles using purified azides that were prepared in one-step from the corresponding amine diazotransfer reagent 21 (Table 4 ). 19 Azides 12a-f were selected to include indolyl, pyridyl, ester, and phenyl derivatives in order to provide a variation in molecular weights, hydrogen bonding donor and acceptor properties, and capabilities for \u03c0interactions. Azides 12a-e were each prepared from the amine using diazotransfer reagent 21, and azide 12f was prepared by direct displacement of a chloride with sodium azide. 20 After purification and isolation, azides 12a-f were then allowed to react directly with the Npropargyl-oxindoles or spirooxindoles in the presence of catalytic Cu(I) iodide (10 mol %) and di-isopropylethylamine (15 mol %) in THF to afford triazoles 4-10. 21 A representative combination of N-propargyl oxindole scaffolds and azide components were evaluated to ascertain the scope of compounds accessible using this strategy ( Figure 2) . Overall, these reactions proceeded with high yields (> 70%) for 36 of 45 triazoles prepared, and only 8 of the 45 reactions afforded less than 66% yield (Table 4) . These low yields are attributed to lower conversion and unreacted starting material for the given reaction time. Of practical consideration, the CuAAC reactions of isatins (entries 20-27) proceeded with excellent yields and were particularly clean and easy to purify.\n\nBecause hydroxy-oxindoles 13-15 were prepared as enantiomerically-enriched compounds using asymmetric catalysis, it is especially important to demonstrate that the enantomeric excess of these compounds was maintained during the CuAAC reaction since these compounds are known to form stabilized carbocations under metal-and acid-catalyzed conditions. 22 The enantiomerically-enriched N-propargylated 3-hydroxy-oxindoles were subjected to the CuAAC conditions with azides 12a-c, e (Table 4, entries 1-14) . The enantiomeric excess of the triazole-containing 3-hydroxy3-indolyl-oxindole 4ba was confirmed by HPLC analysis using chiral stationary phase by comparison to the triazoles produced by racemic synthesis. 23 Due to the similarity of hydroxy-oxindoles 13-15, the retention of enantiomeric excess for 4ba was used as a model for retention of enantioselectivity for all triazole products. Enantiomerically-enriched spiroindolone 16b was used to demonstrate that the enantiomeric excess for this class of spirooxindoles is retained under CuAAC reaction conditions (entry 17). 23b\n\nThe spirocyclic oxazolines 17 and 18 afforded spirocyclic triazoles 9 and 10 in excellent yields (Table 4 , entries [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] ; however, the reversed order of the reaction sequence was also investigated. For spirooxazoline-triazole 9, the titanium(IV)-catalyzed addition and spirocyclization of 5-methoxyoxazole 11e can also be performed using a triazole-containing isatin (derived from azide 12a) in 71% yield and maintaining high diastereoselectivity (97:3 dr). However, the success of the spirocyclization is dependent on the nature of the triazole substrate (see Supporting Information). Although the reaction proceeded successfully with the isatin triazole derived from p-methoxy phenyl azide 12a, the use of an isatin triazole derived from azide 12b did not undergo spirocyclization, presumably due to interactions between the indole ring and the titanium catalyst. Although our earlier investigations had shown that the one-pot reaction using aryl iodides proceeded with low yield, we briefly explored this approach to incorporate additional triazole diversity (Table 5 ). For example, this one-pot method allows the synthesis of triazole isatin 8eh containing an amino group, which cannot be accessed with the previous route described above (Table 4 ). This CuAAC strategy uses 10 mol % of CuI and 15 mol % of DMEDA with one equivalent of aryl-iodide and one equivalent of the alkyne in DMF. 18 Triazoles 8cg and 8eh were obtained when isatins 3c,e were subjected to the reaction with aryl-iodides; however, low yields were observed ( Table 5 , entries 1-2). Similarly, with hydroxy-oxindoles 14 and 15, the reaction was sluggish with catalytic amounts of copper, also affording low yields of the triazole products. When the amount of copper was increased to stoichiometric amounts, several unidentified side-products were formed and the increase in yield was negligible. In order to reduce the amount of side products and increase yields, conditions were modified to use a stoichiometric amount of copper(II) reagent with sodium ascorbate to generate the catalytic Cu(I) species in situ. Even with these optimized conditions, the yield of pyridinyl triazoles remained low (Table 5 , entries [3] [4] [5] . This result is in contrast to the reaction of pyridyl azide 12e, which was successfully utilized and afforded triazole products with excellent yields (Table 4 , entries 22 and 41). However, this method can provide additional interesting compounds for biological screening.\n\nAn analysis of the molecular properties and shape for this collection of oxindole compounds indicates desirable properties and diversity for high-throughput screening and the discovery of pharmaceutical leads or biological probes. Molecular properties for all compounds were calculated (see Supporting Information) and a summary of the average values are provided in Table 6 . The majority of compounds and average values are within accepted ranges for the development of lead compounds. 24 The nucleophile and azide building blocks selected here afford a collection of compounds with molecular weights ranging from 259-721, and calculated partition coefficients (cLogP) values with a range of 0.56 to 5.38, based on the XLogP method of Wang. 25 The molecular weights span a range that includes molecular weights appropriate for lead-like molecules, as well as access to higher molecular weight compounds, which could prove useful as biological probes for the disruption of proteinprotein interactions. 26 In order to visualize the molecular shape diversity, we generated a scatter plot based on the principal moments of inertia (PMI) ratios (Figure 3 ), a method developed by Sauer and Schwarz. 27 This method classifies the molecular shape into three categories: rod (acetylene), disk (benzene), or spherical (adamantine). Since several conformations of a compound are capable of binding to a biological target, a collection of 3D-conformations \u22643 kcal/mol from the minimum energy conformer are represented. This shape analysis also includes the structures of the known biologically active compounds in Figure 1 for comparison.\n\nIn conclusion, we have developed an efficient enantio-and diastereoselective synthetic strategy to access a diverse 64-compound pilot-scale library including 15 oxindole scaffolds and 49 triazole containing-oxindoles and isatins. We demonstrate that enantiomeric excess resulting from the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of oxindoles and spirooxindoles is retained upon further functionalization with the CuAAC reaction, thus providing efficient methods to prepare libraries of enantiomerically-enriched spirocyclic compounds. The nucleophile and azide building blocks selected here afford a collection of compounds with diversity that is appropriate for high-throughput screening and the discovery of pharmaceutical leads or biological probes. All of the compounds in this report have been submitted to the NIH Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository for biological screening.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.
