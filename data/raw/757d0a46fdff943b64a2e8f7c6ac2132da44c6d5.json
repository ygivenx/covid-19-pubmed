{"title": "Ethyl 4-(5-bromo-1H-indol-3-yl)-2", "body": "The title compound, C 23 H 25 BrN 2 O 3 , crystallizes with two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit (Z 0 = 2) which differ in the twist of the 5-bromo-1H-indole ring with respect to the plane of the 4-methyl-1,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydroquinoline ring [dihedral angles of 78.55 (9) and 89.70 (8) in molecules A and B, respectively]. The indole ring is planar in both molecules [maximum deviations = 0.021 (3) and \u00c00.020 (3) \u00c5 for the N atom] while the cyclohexene ring has adopts a sofa conformation. In the crystal, molecules are linked by pairs of N-H\u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1O hydrogen bonds, forming dimers with R 1 2 (6) ring motifs. These dimers are connected by N-H\u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1O hydrogen bonds, generating chains along [110] . A C-H\u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1O contact occurs between the independent molecules.\n\nFor biological properties of 1,4-dihydropyridines, see : Triggle, (2003); \u015e afak & \u015e im\u015fek (2006) .

Following on from these results, we synthesized the title compound and determined its structure.\n\nIn the title compound (I), (Fig. 1, Fig. 2 ), the 5-bromo-1H-indole ring is almost planar in both of the molecules with a maximum deviation from the mean plane of 0.021 (3) \u00c5 for atom N2A and -0.020 (3) \u00c5 for atom N2B. The cyclohexene rings adopt a sofa conformation and are puckered with puckering parameters in molecule A and B (Cremer & Pople, 1975 ) of Q T = 0.472 (4) \u00c5, \u03b8 = 120.7 (5) \u00b0, \u03c6 = 295.1 (5) \u00b0 and Q T = 0.475 (4) \u00c5, \u03b8 = 62.7 (4) \u00b0, \u03c6 = 120.5 (4) \u00b0, respectively. The values of the bond lengths (Allen, 2002) and angles in (I) are in normal ranges and are comparable with those of related structures (El-Khouly et al., 2012; \u00d6zt\u00fcrk Yildirim et al., 2012) .\n\nIn the crystal, molecules are linked by pairs of intermolecular N-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonds, forming dimers with R 1 2 (6) ring motifs (Bernstein et al., 1995; Etter et al., 1990) , and these dimers are connected by N-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonds, generating one-dimensional chains along [110] (Table 1, Fig. 3 ).\n\nThe title compound was prepared by refluxing 4,4-dimethyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione (0.001 mol), ethyl acetoacetate (0.001 mol), 6-bromoindole-2-carbaldehyde (0.001 mol) and ammonium acetate (0.005 mol) in methanol for 8 h. Crystals were grown by slow evaporation of a methanol solution. \n\nAll H atoms were placed in idealized positions (C-H = 0.95-0.99 \u00c5 and N-H = 0.88 \u00c5) and refined as riding atoms with U iso (H) = 1.2U eq (C or N) or 1.5 U eq (C methyl ). A rotating-group model was applied for the methyl groups. The highest residual electron density peak and the deepest hole are located at 0.86 and 0.82 \u00c5 from Br1B, respectively. Forty three outliers,(1 0 0), (-3 6 2), (2 4 0(, (-1 2 7), (1 3 6), (-4 6 2), (1 4 1), (3 1 3), (4 5 1), (-1 0 4), (-11 5 5), (-2 0 12), (-8 6 10), (-3 1 8), (-4 2 4), (3 1 2), (0 5 3), (6 2 1), (-2 1 8), (4 8 9), (-3 3 9), (-7 0 12), (-3 2 8), (-9 3 5), (-8 7 6), (-1 1 1), (-1 1 10), (-4 4 1), (-4 2 5), (-9 9 20), (-3 9 1), (-6 2 3), (-2 0 6), (-9 4 5), (-1 7 3), (3 1 5), (2 4 3), (2 4 4), (-11 3 5), (0 0 6), (0 1 10), (-5 3 2) and (1 8 3), were omitted in the final refinement. \n\nAgilent Xcalibur (Ruby, Gemini) diffractometer Radiation source: Enhance (Cu) X-ray Source Graphite monochromator Detector resolution: 10.5081 pixels mm -1 \u03c9 scans Absorption correction: analytical [(Clark & Reid, 1995) implemented in CrysAlis RED (Agilent (2011)]\n\nT min = 0.270, T max = 0.514 17300 measured reflections 8621 independent reflections 7227 reflections with I > 2\u03c3(I) \n\nSpecial details Experimental. The crystals were very fragile. On cutting the crystals shattered so the smallest viable crystal was selected and an incident collimator of 1.0 mm was used. Analytical numeric absorption correction using a multifaceted crystal model (Clark & Reid, 1995) . Geometry. All e.s.d.'s (except the e.s.d. in the dihedral angle between two l.s. planes) are estimated using the full covariance matrix. The cell e.s.d.'s are taken into account individually in the estimation of e.s.d.'s in distances, angles and torsion angles; correlations between e.s.d.'s in cell parameters are only used when they are defined by crystal symmetry. An approximate (isotropic) treatment of cell e.s.d.'s is used for estimating e.s.d.'s involving l.s. planes. Refinement. Refinement of F 2 against ALL reflections. The weighted R-factor wR and goodness of fit S are based on F 2 , conventional R-factors R are based on F, with F set to zero for negative F 2 . The threshold expression of F 2 > \u03c3(F 2 ) is used only for calculating R-factors(gt) etc. and is not relevant to the choice of reflections for refinement. R-factors based on F 2 are statistically about twice as large as those based on F, and R-factors based on ALL data will be even larger.\n\nx (14) "}
