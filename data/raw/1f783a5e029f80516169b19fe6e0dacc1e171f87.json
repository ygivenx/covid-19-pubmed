{"title": "Metagenomic Nanopore sequencing of influenza virus 1 direct from clinical respiratory samples 2 3", "body": "Influenza is a major global public health threat as a result of its highly pathogenic variants, large 27 zoonotic reservoir, and pandemic potential. Metagenomic viral sequencing offers the potential of 28 a diagnostic test for influenza which also provides insights on transmission, evolution and drug 29 resistance, and simultaneously detects other viruses. We therefore set out to apply Oxford 30 Nanopore Technology to metagenomic sequencing of respiratory samples. We generated 31 influenza reads down to a limit of detection of 10 2 -10 3 genome copies/ml in pooled samples, 32 observing a strong relationship between the viral titre and the proportion of influenza reads (p = 33 4.7x10 -5 ). Applying our methods to clinical throat swabs, we generated influenza reads for 27/27 34 samples with high-to-mid viral titres (Cycle threshold (Ct) values <30) and 6/13 samples with low 35 viral titres (Ct values 30-40). No false positive reads were generated from 10 influenza-negative 36 samples. Thus Nanopore sequencing operated with 83% sensitivity (95% CI 67-93%) and 100% 37 specificity (95% CI 69-100%) compared to the current diagnostic standard. Coverage of full 38 length virus was dependent on sample composition, being negatively influenced by increased 39 host and bacterial reads. However, at high influenza titres, we were able to reconstruct >99% 40 complete sequence for all eight gene segments. We also detected Human Coronavirus and 41 generated a near complete Human Metapneumovirus genome from clinical samples. While 42 further optimisation is required to improve sensitivity, this approach shows promise for the 43 The application of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT; https://nanoporetech.com/) to 75 generate full-length influenza sequences from clinical respiratory samples can address these 76 challenges. ONT offers a 'third-generation', portable, real-time approach to generating long-read 77 sequence data, with demonstrated success across a range of viruses [21, [23] [24] [25] . To date, 78 Nanopore sequencing of influenza has been reported using high titre virus from an in vitro 79 culture system, producing full length genome sequences through direct RNA sequencing [26] or 80 targeted enrichment by either hybridisation of cDNA [27] or influenza-specific PCR amplification 81 [28] . 82 83 We therefore aimed to optimise a metagenomic protocol for detecting influenza viruses directly 84 from clinical samples using Nanopore sequencing. We determine its sensitivity compared to 85 existing diagnostic methods and its accuracy compared to short-read (Illumina) sequencing, 86 using clinical samples from hospital patients during an influenza season, and samples from a 87 laboratory controlled infection in ferrets. 88\n\nWe first sequenced five influenza A positive and five influenza-negative throat swabs, each 91 spiked with Hazara virus control at 10 4 genome copies/ml. Using the SISPA approach [21] 92 followed by Nanopore sequencing, we produced metagenomic data dominated by reads that 93 were bacterial in origin, with extremely few viral reads detected. Passing the sample through a 94 0.4 \u00b5m filter prior to nucleic acid extraction increased the detection of viral reads by several 95 orders of magnitude ( Fig S1) . Filtration is relatively expensive, so we also assessed the 96 alternative approach of adding a rapid centrifugation step to pellet bacterial and human cells, 97 followed by nucleic acid extraction from the supernatant. We used a pooled set of influenza A 98 positive samples (concentration 10 6 genome copies/ml), to provide a large enough sample to 99 .

Enrichment 100 for influenza and Hazara was similar for filtration vs centrifugation, based on reads mapping to 101 the viral genome ( Fig S2) . As centrifugation is simpler and cheaper, we selected this approach 102 for all further testing. 103 104 Method optimisation to reduce time for cDNA synthesis 105\n\nSynthesis of tagged, randomly primed cDNA and its subsequent amplification via SISPA [21] 106 required lengthy reverse transcription and PCR steps (1h and 3h 45min) respectively. 107\n\nOptimising these stages upgraded the reverse transcriptase from SuperScriptIII to 108 SuperScriptIV (ThermoFisher), reduced incubation time to 10min (processing time reduction of 109 50min) and reduced the PCR extension time within each cycle from 5min to 2min (1h 30min 110 processing time reduction). Comparing this final method with our original protocol, using 111 triplicate extractions from the pooled set of influenza A positive samples, demonstrated no 112 significant loss in performance in the more rapid protocol ( Fig S3) and we adopted this 113 approach as our routine protocol. 114 115\n\nStarting with an influenza A positive sample pool (10 6 genome copies/ml), we made three 117 volumetric dilution series using three independent influenza-negative pools (Fig 1) . The total 118 quantity of cDNA after preparation for sequencing was consistently higher in all samples using 119 negative pool-3 as diluent (Fig 2A) , indicating the presence of a higher concentration of non-120 viral RNA within pool-3. This is likely due to host cell lysis or higher bacterial presence, and 121 demonstrates the variable nature of throat swab samples. 122\n\nWe consistently retrieved Hazara virus reads from all three dilution series by Nanopore 124 sequencing, independently of influenza virus titre in the sample (Fig 2B) . Sequencing from 125 dilution series 1 and 2 gave a consistent proportion of total reads mapping to the Hazara 126 genome, across dilutions and between the first two pools with mean values per pool of 1.4x10 3 127 \u00b1660 RPM (reads per million (of total reads) \u00b1 standard deviation) and 1.2x10 3 \u00b1350 RPM 128 respectively. The pool-3 dilution series generated 260 \u00b1340 RPM Hazara reads across samples, 129 and showed a decreasing trend associated with increased dilution factor, as increasingly more 130 non-viral RNA was introduced from this high-background pool. 131 132 Limit of influenza virus detection by Nanopore from pooled samples 133 Nanopore sequencing of the triplicate SISPA preparations of the influenza A positive pool 134 produced mean 5.3x10 4 \u00b13.6x10 4 RPM mapping to the influenza A genome (Fig 2B) . Across the 135 dilution series, the proportion of influenza reads was strongly associated with influenza virus 136 titre (p-value = 4.7x10 -5 ), but was also influenced by which negative pool was used for dilution, 137 consistent with the pattern observed for the Hazara control. Sequencing the negative controls 138 (pools with no influenza virus spike) generated no reads mapping to influenza. At influenza virus 139 titres <10 3 copies/ml, influenza reads were inconsistently detected across the samples (Fig 2B) , 140 suggesting the limit of detection is between 10 2 -10 3 influenza copies/ml. 141 142\n\nFor the Hazara virus control (10 4 genome copies/ml spike), genome coverage was 81.4-99.4% 144 (at 1x depth) for pools 1 and 2. Coverage in the high-background pool 3 was more variable 145 (21.5-96.5%; Fig 3A) . Influenza A genome coverage at 10 6 copies/ml was \u226599.3% for each 146 segment in all samples (Fig 3A) . At 10 4 genome copies/ml of influenza, mean 1x coverage per 147 segment was 90.3% for pools 1 and 2, but was substantially reduced in the high-background 148 pool 3 to 5.7% (Fig 3A) . At influenza titres <10 4 copies/ ml, coverage was highly variable across 149 .

However, when present at 10 3 copies/ml, 2/3 pools had sufficient data for 150 correct subtyping as H3N2 (Table 1) total reads generated was 1.0x10 5 to 2.4x10 6 (median 3.8x10 5 ) (Table S1) . GeneXpert-negative samples (Table S1 ). Based on this small dataset, sensitivity is 83% and 167 specificity 100% (95% CI 67-93% and 69-100%, respectively). There was a strong correlation 168 between Ct value and both reads per sample classified as influenza (R-squared =0.604) and 169 number of influenza reads per million reads (R-squared =0.623) (Fig 4) . 170 171\n\nDetection of the control virus (Hazara at 10 4 genome copies/ml) was highly variable, 173 demonstrating that levels of background non-target RNA are a major source of inter-sample 174 variation. Hazara reads per sample ranged from 0 to 13.5x10 3 (0-3.5x10 4 RPM) with a median 175 .

High 230 error rates are a recognised concern in Nanopore sequence data, and cross-barcode 231 contamination can create challenges when low and high titre samples are batched together [22] . 232\n\nTo avoid these problems, we batched samples according to Ct value, and applied stringent 233 barcode demultiplexing criteria; however, this reduces the total data available for analysis [22] . in the clinical diagnostic laboratory to provide a large enough sample to assess 309 reproducibility ( Fig 1B) ; 310\n\n\u2022 Negative pools: we generated three pools of throat swab samples that had tested The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.
