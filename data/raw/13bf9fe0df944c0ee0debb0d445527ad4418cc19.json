A migrase enzyme has been proposed to aid in the transfer of the acetyl group from 68 C7 to C9, however a specific enzyme has yet to be identified (5, 8, 9) . CasD1 is 69 localized in the late Golgi, so acetyl modifications are added during the later stages of 70 protein glycosylation. The regulatory processes that control the number of acetyl groups 71 added or their positions have not been well defined, although clear differences in 72 expression of 7,9-O-Ac and 9-O-Ac have been reported in mouse and human tissues, 73 chicken embryos, and some other animals (10, 11). CasD1 uses acetyl-CoA and likely 74 has a preference for CMP-Neu5Ac as a substrate, so that it is less active on CMP-75 Neu5Gc (7). The existence of an enzyme to facilitate the migration of acetyl groups from 76 C7 has been proposed, but not identified (5). 77\n\nAt least one sialate O-acetylesterase (SIAE) enzyme regulates the display of 7, O-and 9-O-Ac in many cells and tissues (Fig. 1B) . The SIAE gene encodes two 79 isoforms that vary in the presence of a proposed C-terminal localization tag in the 80 lysosomal (Lse) form that is absent from the cytosolic form (Cse) (12). However, the 81 processes that regulate the expression and activity of these two isoforms remain poorly 82 defined. Lse has been found to localize to the Golgi and/or ER and on the surface of 83 cells when over-expressed, with the majority being secreted into the supernatant (12). 84\n\nAntibody staining shows that Cse is found diffusely throughout the cytosol, where it is 85 thought to remove 9-O-and 7-O-acetyl groups to recycle the Sia for reuse in 86 glycosylation (12).

Here we examine and more closely define the expression and distribution of 9-O-128 acetyl and 7,9-O-acetyl Sia on cells in culture, define the effects of SIAE and CasD1 on 129 display of these Sia modifications, and perform an initial examination of the effects of 130 these modified Sia on infection by IAV and ICV. We used CRISPR-Cas9 for gene O-Ac, while BCoV HE-Fc recognizes primarily 7,9-O-Ac but also has a low affinity for 9-150 O-Ac (10, 11). By immunofluorescence microscopy, the different forms were present at 151 variable levels, with 10 to 70% of the cells showing staining under standard culture 152 conditions ( Fig. 2A,B) . MDCK-NBL2 and MDCK-type I cells showed both strong surface 153 and internal staining for 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac forms, while both were mostly found in 154 intracellular locations in A549 and HEK-293 cells, with an occasional cell showing bright 155 surface staining. MDCK-type II cells showed staining only for 9-O-Ac and none for 7, O-Ac, indicating that these modifications are regulated independently. In HEK-293 and 157 All rights reserved.

Similar 159 localization differences between cell lines have been seen previously using the ICV 160 (including MUC1 and MUC5B) (36). We found that A549 cells were able to secrete 175 MUC5B into conditioned media (Supplemental Fig. 1A) , although we found that the 176 amount secreted was inconsistent between collections. Analysis of conditioned media 177 from A549 cells showed approximately 2% of Sia was 9-O-Ac on secreted proteins with 178 no 7,9-O-Ac detected, indicating that at least in these cells, secreted proteins were not 179 enriched for O-acetylated Sia (Supplemental Fig. 1B) .

This agrees with previous findings that loss of CasD1 leads to loss of both 204 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac modifications in haploid HAP1 cells (7). HPLC analysis of total Sia 205 showed a significant decrease in 9-O-Ac expression compared to wild-type (WT) cells, 206 however very low levels (<1%) were still detectable, despite a lack of staining with the 207 HE-Fc probes (Fig. 4E) . This could be due to exogenous Sia from the fetal bovine 208 serum in the growth media, as is the case for Neu5Gc which is also detectable at 209 similarly low levels on cells even though the gene for Neu5Gc synthesis, CMAH, is not 210 functional in humans or canines (Supplemental showed significantly higher levels of CasD1 mRNA compared to WT cells, indicating 218 that the CasD1 expression plasmid was being transcribed at high levels ( Fig. 4E) . 219\n\nHowever, only a modest increase in average 9-O-and 7,9-O-Ac expression across the 220 population in HEK-293 cells was seen by flow cytometry, while fluorescent microscopy 221 showed heterogeneity of expression in the population (Fig. 4B, C, D) . The transfected 222 MDCK and A549 CasD1-OX cells showed recovery of 9-O-and 7,9-O-Ac synthesis 223 when analyzed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy, but levels were 224 not as high as seen in WT cells (Fig. 4B, C, D) .

This suggests that 7,9-O-227 and 9-O-Ac expression is not directly regulated by the levels of CasD1 gene expression, 228 but may be affected by post-translational regulation of CasD1 activity or removal of the 229 modifications by SIAE or other enzymes. In addition, these modifications are not 230 regulated the same across individual cells as evidenced by the population 231 heterogeneity. SIAE transcripts were seen to be consistently expressed in HEK-293 232 WT, \u0394CasD1, and CasD1-OX cell populations by qPCR analysis, although SIAE mRNA 233 levels in CasD1-OX cells were lower than those seen in WT (Fig. 4E) . 234\n\nTo determine the role of 235 SIAE activity in regulating 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac display, SIAE knockout (\u0394SIAE) cells were 236 generated from WT HEK-293 and A549 cells by targeting early exons in the SIAE gene 237 (Fig. 5A) . Complete knockout of SIAE was confirmed both by genotyping to show 238 deletions in both alleles and by loss of mRNA by qPCR (Fig. 5A, D) . \u0394SIAE cells 239\n\nshowed a small but significant increase in surface display and a large increase in 240 internal display of 9-O-Ac based on flow cytometry, but did not appear to show any 241 changes in surface or internal display of 7,9-O-Ac (Fig. 5B, C) . HPLC analysis also 242 showed a small increase of 9-O-Ac in HEK-293 cells, but no 7,9-O-Ac was detected in 243 either cell line (Fig. 5E) . When the overexpression CasD1 plasmid was transfected into 244 \u0394SIAE cells (\u0394SIAE+CasD1), cells showed an increase in surface and internal 9-O-Ac, 245 but no increase in surface or internal display of 7,9-O-Ac by either flow cytometry or 246 immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 5B,C) . HPLC confirmed the flow cytometry 247 results by showing a small increase of 9-O-Ac levels in HEK-293 cells that were similar 248 to those seen in CasD1-OX (Figs. 5E) .

Interestingly, HEK-293 250 \u0394SIAE+CasD1 cells grew more slowly than either \u0394SIAE or WT cells (Fig. 5F) . 251\n\nHowever, A549 \u0394SIAE+CasD1 showed increased growth rates compared to \u0394SIAE or 252 WT cells, while \u0394SIAE cells had slightly lower growth rates compared to WT. This 253 suggests that 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac may affect cell metabolism and growth rates, and that 254 these effects may be cell type specific. Overall, these results show that SIAE regulates 255 in infection efficiency in any of these cells (Fig. 6A) . IAV strains also showed equal 265 infection efficiency on MDCK WT, \u0394CasD1, and CasD1-OX (Fig. 6C) . However, ICV 266 strains C/Ann Arbor/1/50 and C/Taylor/1233/1947 showed no infectivity in MDCK 267 \u0394CasD1 (Fig. 6B) . Only the Ann Arbor strain recovered infectivity in MDCK CasD1-OX 268 at much lower levels than in MDCK WT, likely due to the lower surface expression of 9-269 O-and 7,9-O-Ac in these cells. It therefore appears that 7,9-O-Ac and 9-O-Ac do not 270 strongly influence IAV infection, likely due to their low levels of expression. However, 271\n\nAll rights reserved.

When we knocked 319 SIAE out of HEK-293 and A549 cells, we saw an increase in 9-O-Ac that was still 320 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/650341 doi: bioRxiv preprint This is unsurprising, as >95% of the Sia is un-acetylated Neu5Ac which can be utilized 340 by IAV as a receptor for binding and entry. However, the 1-2% of 9-O-Ac on the surface 341 of WT MDCK-NBL2 cells was sufficient for ICV virus binding and entry, and that cell 342 susceptibility was lost when CasD1 was inactivated. Similar results are likely seen for 343 other viruses that use these modified Sia as a receptor, including human coronaviruses 344 OC43 and HKU1 (42). present at levels too low to affect IAV, they are expressed at much higher levels in 357 mucosal tissues and in secreted mucins of many animals and tissues, which may 358 provide a more effective barrier (10, 11, 43-45). In future work we are examining these 359 processes for mucus and other sources in different animals. 360\n\nAll rights reserved.
