{"title": "Epitope-based chimeric peptide vaccine design against S, M and E proteins of SARS-CoV-2 1 etiologic agent of global pandemic COVID-19: an in silico approach 2 3", "body": "Introduction neutralizing antibodies and long-term protective immunity in animal models 9 . Furthermore, the E 103 and M proteins also have important functions in the viral assembly of a coronavirus and can 104 augment the immune response against SARS-CoV 11,16,17 . Monoclonal antibodies with potent 105 neutralizing activity have become promising candidates for both prophylactic and therapeutic 106 interventions against SARS-CoV-2 infections 13 . Therefore, the generation of antibodies targeting 107 the RBD and/or NTD of the S glycoprotein, M and E proteins of SARS-CoV-2 would be an 108 important preventive and treatment strategy that can be tested further in suitable models before 109 clinical trials 18 . The nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), buried inside 110 phospholipid bilayer, is the major protein in the helical nucleocapsid of virion. This protein is 111 reported to be more conserved than other structural proteins, an important B cell immunogen, as 112 well as, can elicit long lasting and persistent cellular immune responses. Nevertheless, we did 113 not consider this protein in the chimeric vaccine formation because of its initial unavailability 114 outside of the host cell during infection 19 . \n\nLinear epitopes prediction based on solvent-accessibility and flexibility revealed that 163 chain A of S protein possessed 15 epitopes, of which three epitopes having different residues 164 positions (395-514, 58-194, 1067-1146) were highly antigenic (score > 0.8). However, the B and 165 C chains had 18 and 19 epitopes, respectively, and of them three epitopes in chain B (residues 166 position 1067-1146, 89-194, 58-87) and two epitopes in chain C (residues position 56-194, 1067-167 1146) seem to be highly antigenic (score > 0.8) ( Table 1 ). The amino acid residues 395-514 and 168 56-194 of the detected epitopes belonged to RBD and NTD regions of the S protein, 169 respectively. These regions were considered as the potential epitope candidates in the IEDB 170 analysis resource Elipro analysis. However, the epitopes with amino-acids position of 1067-1146 171\n\nwere not selected as the potential epitope candidate because of their presence in viral 172 transmembrane domains ( Supplementary Fig. 3) . The tertiary structures of the RBD and NTD 173 illustrate their surface-exposed position on the S protein (Fig. 2) . 174 protein possessed only one highly antigenic epitope (57- 194 antigenicity score = 0.449) which might be potentially functional in host cell binding (Table 2) . 195 Furthermore, the Kolaskar and Tongaonkar antigenicity profiling found five highly antigenic 196 epitopes in RBD region with an average (antigenicity) score of 1.042 (minimum = 0.907, 197 maximum = 1.214), and seven highly antigenic epitopes in NTD with an average (antigenicity) 198 score of 1.023 (minimum = 0.866, maximum = 1.213) ( Supplementary Fig. 4 , Supplementary 199 Table 2 ). The average Kolaskar scores for envelop protein B-cell epitope (EBE) and membrane 200 protein B-cell epitope (MBE) were 0.980 and 1.032, respectively (Supplementary Table 2) . 201\n\nHowever, through ABCPred analysis, we identified 18 and 11 B-cell epitopes in RBD and NTD 202 regions with average antigenicity score of 0.775 and 0.773 in the associated domains, 203 respectively (Supplementary Table 3) . 204 205\n\nThe IEDB analysis resource tool was employed to identify T-cell epitopes in RBD nM identifies peptide binders recognized by T-cells, and this threshold can be used to select 215 peptides, we kept binding affinity within 50 nM to get better confidence level in predicting 216 .

The IEDB MHC-I prediction tool retrieved 77 T-cell  217   epitopes in RBD that interacted with 21 possible MHC-I alleles whereas the NTD domain  218   possessed 35 T-cell epitopes with 17 possible MHC-I alleles (Supplementary Data 1) . Similarly, 219 the IEDB MHC-II prediction tool generated 13-mer124 peptides from the RBD, and 10-mer 73 220 peptides in the NTD segments of the S protein that showed interaction with many different 221 and/or common MHC-II alleles with an IC 50 value ranging from 1.4 to 49.9 nM (Supplementary 222 Data 1). Furthermore, for MHC-I and MHC-II processing, the analysis tool of the IEDB 223 generates an overall score for each epitope's intrinsic potential of being a T-cell epitope based on 224 proteasomal processing, TAP transport, and MHC-binding efficiency (Supplementary Data 1). 225\n\nThe outcomes of these tools are quite substantial because they utilize vast number of alleles of 226\n\nHLAs (human-leukocyte-antigens) during computation. 227 228\n\nFrom the selected epitopes from the RBD and NTD segments, top five based on IC 50 230 score were used in molecular docking analysis using the GalaxyWeb server with their respective 231 HLA allele binders, in which they revealed significantly favorable molecular interaction for 232 binding affinity. Docking complexes thus formed have significantly negative binding energy, 233 and most of the aa residues of the epitopes were involved in molecular interactions with their 234 respective HLA alleles (Supplementary data 1). The epitope-HLA docking complexes were 235 further refined with GalaxyRefineComplex, and their binding affinity was analyzed through 236 PRODIGY web-server. All of the selected epitopes showed significantly negative binding 237 affinity (\u0394G always remained \u2264 -8.2 kcal mol -1 , average = -9.94 kcal mol -1 , Fig. 4 \n\nThe findings of IFNepitope program suggests that, both the target RBD and NTD regions 242 of S protein, and B-cell linear epitope (MBE) had great probability to release of IFN-\u03b3 with a 243 positive score. A total of 56 potential positive IFN-\u03b3 inducing epitopes (15-mer) were predicted 244 for the RBD domain with an average epitope prediction score of 0.255 and the maximum SVM 245 score of 0.625. On the other hand, a total of 33 potential positive epitopes were predicted for the 246 NTD domain with an average epitope prediction score of 0.312 and the maximum SVM score of 247 0.811. Moreover, the M protein also possessed several IFN-\u03b3 inducing epitopes having an 248 average epitope prediction score of 0.980 (Supplementary Table 4 (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Data 2) . In addition to geographical 266 distribution, the ethnic groups also found to be an important determinant for good coverage of 267 the CTL and HTL epitopes (Fig. 5b) \n\nThe CoV-RMEN peptide was predicted to contain 43.2% alpha helix, 67.4% beta sheet, 303 and 12% turns (Fig. 6b, Supplementary Fig. 5 ) using CFSSP:Chou and Fasman secondary 304 structure prediction server. In addition, with regards to solvent accessibility of aa residues, 34% 305 were predicted to be exposed, 30% medium exposed, and 34% were predicted to be buried. Only 306 2 aa residues (0.0%) were predicted to be located in disordered domains by the RaptorX Property 307 server ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ).

The cumulative results of 332 immune responses after three times antigen exposure with four weeks interval each time revealed 333 that the primary immune response against the antigenic fragments was elevated indicated by 334 gradual increase of IgM level after each antigen exposure (Fig. 7a) .

The relative binding free 355 energies (\u0394G) of the protein-TLRs complexes were significantly negative (Table 3) content is between 30% and 70% ( Fig. 9 a,b,c) .

The results showed that \u0394 G of the best 380 predicted structure for the optimized construct was \u0394 G = -386.50 kcal/mol. The first nucleotides 381 at 5' did not have a long stable hairpin or pseudoknot. Therefore, the binding of ribosomes to the 382 translation initiation site, and the following translation process can be readily accomplished in 383 the target host. These outcomes were in the agreement with data obtained from the 384 'RNAfold'web server ( Fig. 9 d,e) where the free energy was -391.37 kcal/mol. 385 386\n\nAfter codon optimization and mRNA secondary structure analysis, the sequence of the 388 chimeric peptide vaccine production does not involve virus replication, therefore reduce the cost 416 of production. Hence, a low cost strategy should be adopted for developing a highly demanded 417 vaccine for the mankind. Heterologous expression of any vaccine candidate protein has very 418 promising scopes for developing such low cost vaccine, providing that all essential properties for 419 antigenicity, immunogenicity and functional configuration are being conserved to mimic the 420 structural and functional property of the actual antigen 34 . Construction of a vaccine candidate 421 with multiple potential epitopes can obviously potentiate the multi-valency of the antigen to 422 develop immune response against a number of epitopes of any pathogen. Also, rational 423 engineering of epitopes for increased potency and magnitude, ability to enhance immune 424 . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

This study was designed to assist with the initial phase of multi-epitope 427 vaccine candidate selection. Thereby, safe and effective vaccine development by providing 428 recommendations of epitopes that may potentially be considered for incorporation in vaccine 429 design for SARS-CoV-2. Vaccine design is improved through the use of specialized spacer sequences 39 . To 461 designing the CoV-RMEN (vaccine candidate) GG and EGGE linkers were incorporated 462 between the predicted epitopes to produce sequences with minimized junctional 463 immunogenicity, thereby, allowing the rational design construction of a potent multi-epitope 464 vaccine 21,38 . The molecular weight of our vaccine candidate, the CoV-RMEN is 46.8 kDa with a 465 predicted theoretical pI of 8.71, indicating that the protein is basic in nature. Also, the predicted 466 instability index indicates that the protein will be stable upon expression, thus further 467 strengthening its potential for use. The aliphatic index showed that the protein contains aliphatic 468 side chains, indicating potential hydrophobicity. All these parameters indicate that the 469 .

Secondary structure analysis of the CoV-RMEN indicated that the protein 473 consisted of 43.2% alpha helix, 67.4% beta sheet, and 12% turns with only 2 residues disordered. 474\n\nNatively unfolded protein regions and alpha-helical and beta sheet peptides have been reported 475\n\nto be important forms of structural antigens 21,40 . These two structural forms (secondary and 476 tertiary), when tested as the synthetic peptides, have the ability to fold into their native 477 structure,hence, could be recognized by naturally induced antibodies in response to infection 2 . 478\n\nThe tertiary (3D) structure of the vaccine candidate improved markedly after the refinement, and 479\n\nshowed desirable properties based on Ramachandran plot predictions. The Ramachandran plot 480\n\nshows that most of the residues are found in the favoured and allowed regions (94.7%) with very 481 few residues in the outlier region; this indicates that the quality of the overall model is 482 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.015164 doi: bioRxiv preprint be very effective measure against COVID-19 to reach globally.
