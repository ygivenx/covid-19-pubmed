{"title": "Engineering Infectious cDNAs of Coronavirus as Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes", "body": "Coronaviruses (CoV) are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses relevant in animal and human health (1, 2) . Historically, CoV infection in humans has been associated with mild upper respiratory tract diseases (1) . However, the identification of the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) in 2003 (3) and the recently emerged (April 2012) Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) (4) , which has been associated with acute pneumonia, redefined historic perceptions and potentiated the relevance of CoVs as important human pathogens. In this sense, the development of CoV infectious clones provides a valuable molecular tool to study fundamental viral processes, to develop genetically defined vaccines, and to test antiviral drugs. However, the generation of CoV infectious clones has been hampered for long time due to the huge size of the CoV genome (around 30 kb) and the toxicity of some CoV replicase gene sequences during its propagation in bacteria. Recently, these problems were overcome using non-traditional approaches based on the use of bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) (5) , in vitro ligation of cDNA fragments (6) , and vaccinia virus as a vector for the propagation of CoV fulllength cDNAs (7, 8) .\n\nIn this chapter we describe the protocol to assemble CoV full-length cDNAs in BACs using the MERS-CoV EMC12 strain (9) as an example. In this system, the full-length cDNA copy of the viral genome is assembled in the BAC plasmid pBeloBAC11 (10) (Fig. 1) , a lowcopy-number plasmids based on the Escherichia coli F-factor (11) that presents a strictly controlled replication leading to one or two plasmid copies per cell. This plasmid minimize the instability problem of several CoV sequences when amplified in high-copy-number plasmids, allows the stable maintenance of large DNA fragments in bacteria (11) , and its manipulation is similar to that of conventional plasmids. The cDNA of the CoV genome is assembled in the BAC under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early promoter and it is flanked at the 3\u2032-end by a 25-bp synthetic poly(A) followed by the sequences of the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme and the bovine growth hormone (BGH) termination and polyadenylation signals to produce synthetic RNAs bearing authentic 5\u2032-and 3\u2032-ends of the viral genome. This DNA-launched system couples expression of the viral RNA in the nucleus from the CMV promoter (12) with a second amplification step in the cytoplasm driven by the viral polymerase, allowing the recovery of infectious virus from the cDNA clone without the need of in vitro ligation and transcription steps. Although some splicing events could occur during the nuclear expression of the viral genome, the efficiency of this phenomenon is very low and does not affect the recovery of infectious virus (5) .\n\nThe BAC approach, originally applied to the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) (5), has been successfully used to engineer the infectious clones of the feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) (13) and the human CoVs (HCoVs) HCoV-OC43 (14), SARS-CoV (15) and MERS-CoV (16) , and it is potentially applicable to the cloning of other CoV cDNAs, other viral genomes, and large-size RNAs of biological relevance.\n\nTo reach optimal results, all solutions should be prepared using pure Milli-Q grade water (resistivity of 18.2 M\u03a9/cm at 25\u00b0C) and analytical grade reagents.\n\nPlasmid pBeloBAC11 (New England Biolabs)(10). This plasmid contains genes parA, parB, and parC derived from the E. coli F-factor to ensure the accurate partitioning of plasmids to daughter cells, avoiding the possibility of multiple BACs coexistence in a single cell. In addition, this plasmid carries gene repE and the element oriS involved in initiation and orientation of DNA replication, the chloramphenicol resistance gene (Cm r ), the lacZ gene to allow color-based identification of recombinants by \u03b1-complementation, and the restriction sites ApaLI, SfoI, BamHI, HindIII, and SfiI to clone large DNA fragments (Fig. 1 ).\n\n2. E. coli DH10B strain (Life Technologies, Invitrogen) [F -mcrA \u0394 (mrr-hsdRMS-mcrBC) \u00d880dlacZ\u0394M15 \u0394lacX74 deoR recA1 endA1 araD139 (ara, leu)7697 galU galK \u03bb -rpsL nupG] (see Note 1).\n\nIn case that no adequate restriction sites were available in the viral genome, new restriction sites, appropriately spaced in the viral genome, could be generated by the introduction of silent mutations. In addition, natural restriction sites could be eliminated following the same approach to facilitate the assembly of the infectious clone (see Note 5).\n\nAssemble the Full-Length cDNA Clone-The assembly of the infectious clone in a BAC is facilitated by the construction of an intermediate BAC plasmid containing the 5\u2032-end of the genome (until the first restriction site selected) under the control of the CMV promoter, a multicloning site containing the restriction sites selected in the first step, and the 3\u2032-end of the genome (from the last restriction site selected to the end of the genome) followed by a 25-nt poly(A) tail, the HDV ribozyme, and the BGH termination and polyadenylation sequences. All these elements have to be precisely assembled to produce synthetic RNAs bearing authentic 5\u2032-and 3\u2032-ends of the viral genome. A detailed protocol for the generation of the MERS-CoV intermediate plasmid, pBAC-MERS-CoV 5\u2032-3\u2032, is described next (Fig. 2 ).\n\nGenerate by chemical synthesis a DNA fragment containing the CMV promoter (12) precisely fused to the first 811 nt of the viral genome (from the first nucleotide to the restriction site BamHI), flanked at the 5\u2032-and 3\u2032-ends by restriction sites SfoI and BamHI, respectively. Alternatively, this DNA fragment could be generated by PCR using two overlapping PCR fragments as template (see Note 6) . One of these fragments should contain the CMV promoter flanked at the 5\u2032-end by the restriction site SfoI and at the 3\u2032-end by the 20 first nucleotides of the genome as overlapping sequence. The second overlapping PCR fragment should expand from the first nucleotide to the restriction site BamHI.\n\nThe generated DNA fragment is digested with SfoI and BamHI, and cloned into pBeloBAC11 -StuI (a pBeloBAC without the StuI restriction site) digested with the same restriction enzymes to generate the plasmid pBAC-MERS-CoV 5\u2032.\n\nGenerate a second DNA fragment, containing the last 4,272 nt of the viral genome (from the restriction site PacI at genomic position 25,836 to the end of the genome) precisely joined to a 25-nt poly(A) tail, the HDV ribozyme and the BGH termination and polyadenylation sequences, flanked at the 5\u2032-end by a multicloning site with the restriction sites selected before (BamHI, StuI, SwaI, and PacI) and at the 3\u2032-end by the restriction site SfiI. This DNA fragment could be generated by chemical synthesis or by overlapping PCR as described before (see Notes 6 and 7 ).\n\nDigest with BamHI and SfiI the second DNA fragment (containing the multicloning site, the viral 3\u2032-end followed by the poly(A) tail, and the HDV-BGH sequences) and clone it into the plasmid pBAC-MERS-CoV 5\u2032 digested with the same restriction enzymes to generate the intermediate plasmid pBAC-MERS-CoV 5\u2032-3\u2032 (Fig. 2 ).\n\nAfter each cloning step, the integrity of the cloned DNA fragments is verified by restriction analysis and sequencing. 2. The overlapping DNAs flanked by the appropriated restriction sites are generated either by chemical synthesis or by standard reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) (see Note 6) using specific oligonucleotides and total RNA from infected cells as template. In the case of fragment MERS-3, a silent mutation (T to C) was introduced at position 20,761 to abrogate the SwaI restriction site at position 20,760. This mutation facilitates the cloning process and can be used as a genetic marker to identify the virus recovered from the full-length cDNA clone.\n\nThe genetic integrity of the cloned DNAs is verified throughout the subcloning and assembly process by extensive restriction analysis and sequencing.\n\nOne of the major advantages of using BAC vectors to generate infectious clones is that the manipulation of BAC clones is relatively easy and essentially the same to that of a conventional plasmid with slight modifications due to the huge size of the BAC clones and the presence of this plasmid in only one or two copies per cell (11).\n\nThe amplification and isolation of BAC plasmids is performed using standard procedures described for conventional plasmids but using large volumes of bacterial cultures.\n\nSmall amounts of BAC DNAs are prepared from 5-mL cultures of BAC transformed DH10B cells by the alkaline lysis method. Any commercial kit could be used, but we suggest the QIAprep Miniprep Kit (Qiagen) following the recommendations for purification of large low-copy plasmids.\n\nStreak the bacterial stock containing the BAC plasmid onto a LB agar plate containing 12.5 \u03bcg/mL chloramphenicol and incubate for 16 h at 37\u00b0C (see Note 9).\n\nInoculate a single colony in 5 mL of LB medium plus 12.5 \u03bcg/mL chloramphenicol in a flask with a volume of at least four times the volume of the culture and incubate for 16 h at 37\u00b0C with vigorous shaking (250 rpm) (see Note 10).\n\nHarvest the bacterial cells in 15 mL centrifuge tubes by centrifugation at 6000g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C and pour off the supernatant fluid.\n\nPurify the BAC plasmid following the manufacturer's instructions. Owing to the size of BAC DNAs and the need to use large culture volumes, we recommend duplicating the volume of buffers P1, P2, and N3, performing the optional wash step with buffer PB, and eluting the DNA from the QIAprep membrane using buffer EB preheated at 70\u00b0C (see Note 11).\n\nDepending of the BAC size, yields of 0.1-0.4 \u03bcg can be obtained. Although the BAC DNA prepared by this method is contaminated with up to 30% of bacterial genomic DNA, it is suitable for analysis by restriction enzyme digestion or PCR.\n\nLarge-scale preparation of ultrapure BAC DNA suitable for all critical applications, including subcloning, DNA sequencing or transfection experiments, is performed by alkaline lysis with the Qiagen Large-Construct Kit, which has been specifically developed and adapted for BAC purification. This kit integrates an ATP-dependent exonuclease digestion step that enables efficient removal of bacterial genomic DNA contamination to yield ultrapure BAC DNA.\n\nInoculate a single colony from a freshly streaked plate (LB agar plate containing 12.5 \u03bcg/mL chloramphenicol) (see Note 9) in 5 mL of LB medium containing 12.5 \u03bcg/mL chloramphenicol and incubate for 8 h at 37\u00b0C with vigorous shaking (250 rpm).\n\n3. Dilute 1 mL of the culture into 500 mL of selective LB medium (see Note 10) prewarmed to 37\u00b0C and grow the cells with vigorous shaking (250 rpm) in a 2-L flask at 37\u00b0C for 12-16 h, to an OD at 550 nm between 1.2 and 1.5. This cell density typically corresponds with the transition from a logarithmic to a stationary growth phase (see Note 12).\n\nHarvest the bacterial cells by centrifugation at 6000g(6000 rpm in a Sorvall GS3 rotor) for 15 min at 4\u00b0C and purify the BAC DNA with the Qiagen Large-Construct 9 Cultures of BAC transformed bacteria should be grown from a single colony isolated from a freshly streaked selective plate. Subculturing directly from glycerol stocks or plates that have been stored for a long time may lead to loss of the construct. 10 LB broth is the recommended culture medium, since richer broths such as TB (Terrific Broth) lead to extremely high cell densities, which can overload the purification system, resulting in lower yield and less purity of the BAC DNA. 11 When other kits are used instead of the QIAprep Miniprep Kit (Qiagen), equivalent modifications have to be included to optimize the recovery of BAC DNA. 12 To avoid DNA degradation and unwanted rearrangements owing to culture overaging, it is important to prevent growing the culture up to the late stationary growth phase.\n\nKit according to the manufacturer's specifications (see Note 13) . Depending of the BAC size, yields of 20-35 \u03bcg of ultrapure BAC DNA can be obtained.\n\nto the large size of BAC plasmids, the cloning of DNA fragments in BACs requires the use of DH10B competent cells with transformation efficiencies higher than 1 \u00d7 10 8 transformant colonies per \u03bcg of DNA. These efficiencies are easily obtained by the electroporation method, which is more reproducible and efficient than the chemical methods. Here we described the protocol for preparing electro competent DH10B cells from 1 L of bacterial culture. All the steps of this protocol should be carried out under sterile conditions.\n\nInoculate a single colony of DH10B cells from a freshly streaked LB agar plate into a flask containing 10 mL of SOB medium and incubate the culture overnight at 37\u00b0C with vigorous shaking (250 rpm).\n\n2. Dilute 1 mL of the overnight culture into 1L of SOB medium pre-warmed at 37\u00b0C and grow the cells with vigorous shaking (250 rpm) in a 2-L flask at 37\u00b0C until the OD at 550 nm reaches 0.7 (this can take 4-5 h) (see Note 14) .\n\nTransfer the flask to an ice-water bath for about 20 min. Swirl the culture occasionally to ensure that cooling occurs evenly. From this point on, it is crucial that the temperature of the bacteria not rise above 4\u00b0C.\n\nDivide the bacteria culture in two ice-cold 500-mL centrifuge bottles and harvest the cells by centrifugation at 6000g (6000 rpm in a Sorvall GS3 rotor) for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. Discard the supernatant and resuspend each cell pellet in 500 mL of ice-cold 10% glycerol in sterile water.\n\nHarvest the cells by centrifugation at 6000g (6000 rpm in a Sorvall GS3 rotor) for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. Carefully pour off the supernatant and resuspend each cell pellet in 250 mL of ice-cold 10% glycerol (see Note 15).\n\nRepeat step 5 reducing the resuspension volume to 125 mL from each cell pellet.\n\nHarvest the cells by centrifugation at 6000g (6000 rpm in a Sorvall GS3 rotor) for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. Carefully pour off the supernatant (see Note 15) and remove any remaining drops of buffer using a Pasteur pipette attached to a vacuum line.\n\nResuspend the cells in a final volume of 3 mL of ice-cold 10% glycerol, avoiding the generation of bubbles. This volume has been calculated to reach an optimal cell concentration of 2-4 \u00d7 10 10 cells/mL. 13 The use of a swinging bucket rotor is recommended for the last isopropanol precipitation step to facilitate the further resuspension of the BAC DNA. After washing with 70% ethanol, air-dry the pellet for only 5 min. Never use vacuum, as overdrying the pellet will make the BAC DNA difficult to dissolve. Carefully remove any additional liquid drop, add 250 \u03bcL of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) (DNA dissolves better under slightly alkaline conditions) and resuspend the DNA overnight at 4\u00b0C. To prevent plasmid shearing, avoid vortexing or pipetting to promote resuspension of the BAC DNA. Transfer the DNA to a clean 1.5 mL microfuge tube, remove any possible resin traces by centrifugation for 1 min in a table-top microfuge, and keep the supernatant in a clean tube at 4\u00b0C. If the purified BAC DNA is not going to be used for a long period of time we recommend storage at -20\u00b0C. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles to prevent plasmid shearing. 14 For efficient cell transformation, bacterial culture OD at 550 nm should not exceed 0.8. To ensure that the culture does not grow to a higher density, OD measurement every 20 min after 3 h of growth is highly recommended. 15 Take care when decanting the supernatant as the bacterial pellets lose adherence in 10% glycerol.\n\nTransfer 50 \u03bcL of the suspension to an ice-cold electroporation cuvette (0.2-cm gap) and test whether arcing occurs when an electrical discharge is applied with the electroporation apparatus using the conditions described in Section 3.2.3.3, step 4. Arcing is usually manifested by the generation of a popping sound in the cuvette during the electrical pulse. If arcing occurs, wash the cell suspension once more with 100 mL of 10% glycerol and repeat steps 7 and 8.\n\nDispense 100 \u03bcL aliquots of the final cell suspension into sterile, ice-cold 1.5 mL microfuge tubes, freeze quickly in a dry-ice methanol bath, and transfer to a \u221270\u00b0C freezer. Electro competent DH10B cells could be stored at \u221270\u00b0C for up to six months without loss of transforming efficiency.\n\nThe same standard techniques used for the cloning of DNA in conventional plasmids are applied to BACs with special considerations owing to the large size of BAC plasmids.\n\nDigest the BAC vector and foreign DNA with a two-to three-fold excess of the desired restriction enzymes for 3 h using the buffers supplied with the enzymes and check a small aliquot of the digestions by agarose gel electrophoresis to ensure that the entire DNA has been cleaved. Use an amount of target DNA sufficient to yield 2\u03bcg of the BAC vector and 0.25-0.5 \u03bcg of the desired DNA insert.\n\nWhen two enzymes requiring different buffers are used to digest the DNA, carry out the digestion sequentially with both enzymes. Clean the DNA after the first digestion by extraction with phenol:chloroform and standard ethanol precipitation or by using the Qiagen QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit following the manufacturer's instructions for purifying DNA fragments from aqueous solutions (see Note 16).\n\nPurify the digested BAC vector and the DNA insert by agarose gel electrophoresis using the Qiagen QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit following the manufacturer's instructions (see Note 16) . Determine the concentration of the BAC vector and the insert by UV spectrophotometry or by quantitative analysis on an agarose gel.\n\nIf the BAC vector was digested with only one restriction enzyme or with restriction enzymes leaving compatible or blunt ends, the digested BAC vector has to be dephosphorylated prior to its purification by agarose gel electrophoresis to suppress self-ligation of the BAC vector. We recommend cleaning the DNA before the dephosphorylation reaction as described in step 2 and using shrimp alkaline phosphatase following the manufacturer's specifications.\n\nFor protruding-ended DNA ligation, mix in a sterile microfuge tube 150 ng of purified digested BAC vector, an amount of the purified insert equivalent to a molar ratio of insert to vector of 3:1, 1.5 \u03bcL of 10\u00d7 T4 DNA ligase buffer containing 10 mM ATP, 3 Weiss unit of T4 DNA ligase, and water to a final volume of 15 \u03bcL. In separate tubes, set up two additional ligations as controls, one containing only the vector and the other containing only the insert. Incubate the reaction mixtures for 16 h at 16\u00b0C (see Note 17).\n\nIn the case of blunt-ended DNAs, to improve the ligation efficiency use 225 ng of vector, the corresponding amount of insert, 6 Weiss unit of T4 DNA ligase, and incubate the reaction mixtures for 20 h at 14\u00b0C.\n\nThaw the electrocompetent DH10B cells at room temperature and transfer them to an ice bath.\n\nFor each transformation, pipette 50 \u03bcL of electrocompetent cells into an ice-cold sterile 1.5 mL microfuge tube and place it on ice together with the electroporation cuvettes. \n\nSet the electroporation machine to deliver an electrical pulse of 25 \u03bcF capacitance, 2.5 kV, and 100 \u03a9 resistance (see Note 18).\n\nAdd the DNA/cells mixture into the cold electroporation cuvette avoiding bubbles formation and ensuring that the DNA/cells mixture sits at the bottom of the cuvette. Dry the outside of the cuvette with filter paper and place the cuvette in the electroporation device.\n\nDeliver an electrical pulse at the settings indicated above. A time constant of 4-5 msec should be registered on the machine (see Note 19) .\n\nImmediately after the electrical pulse, remove the cuvette and add 1 mL of SOC medium pre-warmed at room temperature.\n\nTransfer the cells to a 17 \u00d7 100-mm polypropylene tube and incubate the electroporated cells for 50 min at 37\u00b0C with gentle shaking (250 rpm).\n\nPlate different volumes of the electroporated cells (2.5, 20 and 200 \u03bcL) onto LB agar plates containing 12.5 \u03bcg/mL chloramphenicol and incubate them at 37\u00b0C for 16-24 h (see Note 20) .\n\nThe recombinant colonies containing the insert in the correct orientation are identified by direct PCR analysis using specific oligonucleotides and conventional Taq DNA polymerase (see Note 21).\n\nFor each bacterial colony prepare a PCR tube with 25 \u03bcL of sterile water.\n\nUsing sterile yellow tips, pick the bacterial colonies, make small streaks (2-3 mm) on a fresh LB agar plate containing 12.5 \u03bcg/mL chloramphenicol to make a replica, and transfer the tips to the PCR tubes containing the water (see Note 22). In separate tubes, set up positive and negative controls. Leave the tips inside the PCR tubes for 5 min at room temperature.\n\nDuring this incubation time, prepare a 2\u00d7 master mix containing 2\u00d7 PCR buffer, 3 mM MgCl 2 (it has to be added only in the case that the PCR buffer does not contain MgCl 2 ), 0.4 mM dNTPs, 2 \u03bcM of each primer, and 2.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase per each 25 \u03bcL of master mix. Prepare the appropriate amount of 2\u00d7 master mix taking into consideration that the analysis of each colony requires 25 \u03bcL of this master mix.\n\nRemove the yellow tip and add 25 \u03bcL of 2\u00d7 master mix to each PCR tube.\n\nTransfer the PCR tubes to the thermocycler and run a standard PCR, including an initial denaturation step at 95\u00b0C for 5 min to liberate and denature the DNA templates and to inactivate proteases and nucleases.\n\nAnalyze the PCR products by electrophoresis through an agarose gel.\n\nPick the positive colonies from the replica plate and isolate the BAC DNA as described in Section 3.2.1 for further analysis.\n\n1. Mix 0.5 mL of LB freezing medium with 0.5 mL of an overnight bacterial culture in a cryotube with a screw cap.\n\nVortex the culture to ensure that the glycerol is evenly dispersed, freeze in ethanoldry ice, and transfer to \u221270\u00b0C for long-term storage. 20 Plating volumes higher than 200 \u03bcL of electroporated cells on a single plate may inhibit the growth of transformants owing to the large number of dead cells resulting from electroporation. If only small numbers of transformant colonies are expected, it is recommended to spread 200 \u03bcL-aliquots of the electroporated cells on different plates. 21 A mix of small and large colonies indicates that the cloned DNA fragment presents some toxicity when amplified in E. coli. Choose the small colonies, which may contain the correct insert, and always grow the bacteria containing this recombinant BAC plasmid at 30\u00b0C to minimize the toxicity problem. In this case, we strongly recommend inserting this toxic DNA fragment into the infectious clone in the last cloning step, in order to reduce the manipulation and minimize the possibility of introducing unwanted mutations. Infectious BAC cDNA clones presenting a residual toxicity should be grown at 30\u00b0C. 22 It is important to avoid overloading the reaction by adding too much bacteria, which may alter the ionic balance of the reaction and inhibit the amplification by the Taq polymerase. \n\nAlternatively, a bacterial colony can be stored directly from the agar plate without being grown in liquid media. Using a sterile yellow tip, scrape the bacteria from the agar plate and resuspend the cells into 200 \u03bcL of LB medium in a cryotube with a screw cap. Add an equal volume of LB freezing medium, vortex the mixture, and freeze the bacteria as described in step 2 (see Note 23).\n\nThe modification of BAC clones is relatively easy and it is performed using the same techniques as for conventional plasmids with the modifications described in this chapter. We recommend introducing the desired modifications into intermediate BAC plasmids containing the different viral cDNA fragments used during the assembly of the full-length cDNA clone, and then inserting the modified cDNA into the infectious clone by restriction fragment exchange. Besides standard protocols, the BAC clones can be easily and efficiently modified in E. coli by homologous recombination using a two-step procedure that combines the Red recombination system and counterselection with the homing endonuclease I-SceI (17-20) (see Note 24) \n\nDuring this incubation period, wash the BHK-21 cells once with growth medium without antibiotics and leave the cells in 1 mL of the same medium per dish.\n\nAdd the 500 \u03bcL of the DNA/Lipofectamine 2000 mixture onto the washed cells and mix by rocking the plate back and forth. Incubate the cells at 37\u00b0C for 6 h (see Note 30).\n\nRemove the transfection medium, wash the cells with trypsin-EDTA solution, and detach the cells using 300 \u03bcL of trypsin-EDTA solution. Add 700 \u03bcL of growth media to collect the cells and reseed them over a confluent monolayer of susceptible cells containing 1 mL of normal growth medium.\n\nIncubate at 37\u00b0C until a clear cythopathic effect was observed.\n\nAnalyze the presence of virus in the supernatant by titration.\n\nClone the virus and analyze the genotypic and phenotypic properties of the recovered virus. The regulatory genes parA, parB, parC, and repE, the F-factor replication origin (OriS), the chloramphenicol resistance gene (Cm r ), the lacZ gene, and the restriction sites that can be used to clone foreign DNAs are indicated.
