{"title": "MOLAR ABSORPTIVITY AND A;$ VALUES FOR PROTEINS AT SELECTED WAVELENGTHS OF THE ULTRAVIOLET AND VISIBLE REGIONS-XVIII", "body": "The molar absorptivi'ty and Ai?m values for m.ore than 180 proteins and the conditions under which these values were obtained are listed in Table 1 . Additional pertinent information can be found in the footnotes to Table 1 . This paper is part of a continuing compilation of protein data. [ \n\nLibrary of the Downstate Medical Center College of Medicine has been the major source of ali publications examined. What was not. available in the library was obtained for me from othtr libraries by our Inter:Library Loan service. I should like to thank the librarians.for their most useful and continuing assistance.\n\nDuring the summer months of 1971-1975 and 1977-1979 I used ' Refers to the wavelength cited and may not be the peak of the absorption band.\n\ndAbbreviations used and methods of protein determination:\n\nAbbreviations: j This is a ternary complex of enzyme, 5-fluorodeoxyuridylate. and methylenetetrahydrofolate.
