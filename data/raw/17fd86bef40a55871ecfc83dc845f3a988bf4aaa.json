To attach CedV sG to the sensor chip surface, the polyclonal anti-S-tag antibody (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.; Montgomery, TX) was immobilized onto the chip surface using an amine coupling kit (GE Healthcare, Inc.). The anti-S-tag antibody (30 \u00b5g/ml) was diluted in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0 and immobilized on the CM5 chip surface. Next, the CedV sG was injected over the anti-S-tag antibody at 10 \u00b5L/min for 5 minutes to capture the CedV sG to the sensor chip surface. To monitor ephrin binding, different concentrations of the indicated recombinant soluble ephrin ligands (human ephrin-A1 Fc transiently expressed in 293 cells and purified; mouse ephrin-A1, mouse ephrin-A2, human ephrin-A5, mouse ephrin-B1, and mouse ephrin-B2 from the ephrin sampler pack 3, SMPK3, R&D Systems; Minneapolis, MN) were injected over the captured CedV sG at a flow rate of 25 \u00b5L/min. The soluble ephrin proteins were injected over the CM5 sensor chip surfaces either with or without captured CedV sG. Chip surfaces lacking captured CedV sG served as control surfaces for nonspecific ephrin binding. The antibody surface was regenerated by injection of 10 mM Glycine, pH 2.0 for 30 seconds. The curve-fitting function of the BIAevaluation 4.1 software was used to fit rate equations derived from the simple 1:1 Langmuir binding model to the experimental data. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was determined from the kinetic rate constants. All values are an average of two independent experiments with two technical replicates for each of the ephrin concentrations tested.\n\nBriefly, effector CHO745 cells transfected with a 1:1 ratio of henipavirus F and G expression plasmids were infected with recombinant vaccinia virus vTF7.3 encoding bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (MOI: 10). Target CHO745 cells transfected with expression plasmids encoding recombinant ephrin genes or the empty vector (mock), were infected with recombinant vaccinia virus vCB21R encoding the E.coli lacZ reporter gene under the control of the T7 promoter (MOI: 10). Cells were kept at 37\u00b0C with gentle rocking for 2.5 hours, washed with trypsin (0.25%)-EDTA (0.02%) (Quality Biological Inc.), collected, re-suspended in F12K-10 at a concentration of 2 \u00d7 10 5 cells/mL in 50 mL conical tubes and incubated overnight at 31\u00b0C. The next day the cells were washed in F12K-10, counted and adjusted to 1 x 10 6 cells/mL in F12K-10 supplemented with 0.04 mg/mL cytosine \u03b2-D-arabino-furanoside hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich). Various effector and target cell populations were mixed at a 1:1 ratio in 96-well plate format to yield 2 \u00d7 10 5 total cells per well in a total volume of 0.2 mL. Nonidet P-40 Alternative (0.5%) (EMD Millipore; Billerica, MA) was added after 3 hours incubation at 37\u00b0C before the plates were frozen at -80\u00b0C overnight. Aliquots of the lysates were assayed for \u03b2-galactosidase activity at 37\u00b0C upon addition of the substrate chlorophenol red-D-galactopyranoside (CPRG) (Roche Applied Science; Indianapolis, IN). Assays were performed in technical duplicates; fusion results were collected with a VersaMAX microplate reader (Molecular Devices; Sunyvale, CA), calculated and expressed as rates of \u03b2-Gal activity (change in O.D. at 570 nm per minute \u00d7 1,000) (1).\n\nBriefly, CHO-K1 cells (1 \u00d7 10 4 cells/well in a clear bottom, black wall 96-well plate) were co-transfected with 60 ng of the expression plasmid for the indicated receptor and 60 ng of the expression plasmid for one half of a split-luciferase reporter protein (DSP1-7, a kind gift of Z. Matsuda). As a control, CHO-K1 cells were only transfected with DSP1-7. Concurrently, CHO-K1 cells (5 \u00d7 10 5 cells/well in a 6-well plate) were transfected with 500ng of the other dual-splitreporter expression plasmid (DSP8 -11), and 500 ng each of the untagged CedV F-and Gexpression plasmids. Thirty-six hours post-transfection, Versene (0.48 mM EDTA in PBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to gently detach the CHO-K1 cells from the 6-well plate and 2 \u00d7 10 4 cells/well overlaid on the receptor-expressing CHO-K1 cells in the 96-well plate. EnduRen (Promega; WI, USA) was added as the substrate to the culture medium (DMEM, 10% FBS) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Content mixing between CHO-K1 cells expressing the two different halves of the luciferase protein as a result of fusion driven by interactions between cells expressing the CedV fusion apparatus and the receptor-expressing CHO-K1 cells was monitored at the indicated times using an Infinite M200 Pro microplate reader (Tecan; Switzerland).\n\nCedV, HeV and NiV soluble receptor-binding proteins (sG) were each coupled to specific magnetic microspheres following a standard manufacturer protocol (Bio-Rad) and mixed together. Henipavirus sG coupled microspheres were incubated with serial diluted human monoclonal antibody, m102.4, at indicated concentrations and incubated at room temperature with agitation. Wells were washed with PBS-Tween (0.05%) then incubated with biotinylated anti-human IgG (1:10,000), agitated, washed and finally incubated with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (PE). The PE signal for each sG-coupled microsphere -hm102.4 complex was detected as a median fluorescence intensity (MFI) by a Bio-Plex 200 machine (Bio-Rad).
