However, nucleotide sequencing showed the presence of prototypical Hantaan virus indicating a spillover infection or laboratory contamination (7) .\n\nFurther screening is necessary to confi rm N. hispida as a natural reservoir host of the virus. Although the presented bat-associated sequence is obviously distinct from other hantaviruses, which suggests association with a novel natural host, a spillover infection from another, yet unrecognized host cannot be ruled out. However, detection of the virus exclusively in 1 organ (lung but not in liver, kidney, and spleen; data not shown) suggests a persistent infection that is typically observed in natural hosts of hantaviruses (8) .\n\nTo date, only a few reports exist on cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Africa (9,10). However, underreporting must be assumed because the symptoms resemble those of many other febrile infections. Moreover, in cases of infections by non-rodent-associated hantaviruses, cross-reactivity with routinely used rodent-borne virus antigens should be limited and may hamper human serodiagnostics (1). The results suggest that bats, which are hosts of many emerging pathogens (5), may act as natural reservoirs for hantavirus. The effect of this virus on public health remains to be determined.\n\nTo the Editor: Beginning in October 2010, porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), caused by a coronaviral infection affecting pigs, emerged in China in an outbreak characterized by high mortality rates among suckling piglets. The outbreak overwhelmed >10 provinces in southern China, and >1,000,000 piglets died. This outbreak was distinguished by \u2248100% illness among piglets after birth (predominantly within 7 days and sometimes within only a few hours) and death rates of 80%-100% (online Technical Appendix Table 1 , wwwnc. cdc.gov/EID/pdfs/11-1259-Techapp. pdf). Few sows or boars showed any clinical signs during the outbreak, which is not consistent with a recent report from Thailand (1). In that outbreak during late 2007, pigs of all ages were affected, exhibiting different degrees of diarrhea and no appetite. We characterized the genetic variation of the PED virus (PEDV) that caused a large-scale outbreak in China during 2010-2011 and compared it with viruses in other outbreaks. We also report a possible novel transmission pathway for PEDV.\n\nA total of 177 samples (intestine, stool, and maternal milk) were collected from pigs from different farms who had diarrhea; 100% of farms had >1 porcine sample positive for PEDV. A total of 125/177 porcine samples were confi rmed as positive for PEDV by reverse transcription PCR using primers as described (2) . PEDV was detected in 105 (82.0%) of 128 fecal samples and 20 (40.8%) of 49 sow milk samples. Piglets infected with PEDV showed mild hemorrhage, undigested curdled milk in the stomach, and thin-walled intestines with severe mucosal atrophy and foamy fl uid (data not shown).\n\nThe spike (S) gene of the family Coronaviridae has a high degree of variation and can induce neutralizing antibody (3). Reverse transcription PCR products of the 651-bp partial S gene of PEDV and the deduced amino acid sequences were aligned by using ClustalW (www.genome. jp/tools/clustalw), and a neighborjoining tree with 1,000 bootstraps was constructed. Sequences of the S genes from this outbreak were 99.1%-100.0% homologous and had 88.7%-98.9% nt identity with all reference strains (online Technical Appendix Table 2 ), 98.5%-98.9% with Thailand strains, and 94.5%-95.1% with vaccine strain CV777. The partial S gene deduced amino acid sequences were compared and also showed a high degree of homology (98.0%-100.0%); they had 85.3%-98.7% identity with all reference strains listed in online Technical Appendix Table 2 , 98.0%-98.7% with Thailand strains, and 93.3%-94.7% with vaccine strain CV777 (data not shown).\n\nPhylogenetic analysis indicated that the PEDV in the China outbreak was different from foreign and other domestic strains on the basis of the reported partial S gene sequences. All new strains were clustered in the same branch, close to the cluster of Thailand strains, and far from the cluster of vaccine strain CV777 (Figure) .\n\nIn the China outbreak, PEDV caused severe diarrheal disease in piglets; heavy economic losses in many provinces resulted, despite use of commercial vaccines (inactivated Phylogenic analysis showed that strain CV777 did not cluster with current common strains and showed 4) . To our knowledge, fecal-oral transmission is probably the main or only route of PEDV transmission (5) (6) (7) . In our study, if a fecal sample from a sick piglet was found to be positive for PEDV, we also collected and studied milk from its mother. These results showed that PEDV was present in sow milk (online Technical Appendix Table 3 ), but the detection rate was lower for these samples (40.8%) than for the fecal samples (82.0%).\n\nOn the basis of these results, we hypothesize that sow milk could represent a possible (and potentially major) route for the vertical transmission of PEDV from sow to suckling piglet. This hypothesis could be indirectly verifi ed by our fi eld observation that piglet death rates decreased as a result of fostering (data not shown). Our fi ndings show that PEDV was identifi ed not only in fecal samples from sick piglets, as expected, but also in the milk of the sow, which suggests vertical transmission of the virus."}
