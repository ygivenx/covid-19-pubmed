Not only patients with symptoms, but also patients in the incubation period, can become the source of infection. Therefore, early diagnosis is very important.\n\nRadiological examinations, as a routine imaging tool for pneumonia diagnosis, is of great importance in the early detection and treatment of patients affected by . Radiological examinations are relatively easy to perform and can produce fast diagnosis. Chest radiography is not sensitive for the detection of ground-glass opacity (GGO) and may demonstrate normal findings in early stage of infection. In contrast, thin-section chest CT examination plays a key role in assisting diagnosis. To date, there remains considerable knowledge gaps in the chest CT imaging features of In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim to quantitatively summarize results from published studies to date in order to provide a more precise estimate of detection of COVID-19 by chest CT and report on the most common imaging findings on chest CT imaging.\n\nWe searched PubMed for studies reporting CT imaging features of COVID-19 published between 1 December 2019 to 29 February 2020. The search terms included (COVID-19) OR (2019 Novel Coronavirus) OR (2019-nCoV). In addition, we reviewed the reference lists of retrieved articles for additional articles. Two independent investigators screened titles/abstracts according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The meta-analysis was performed using PRISMA guidelines.\n\nTitles and abstracts of the articles were screened using the following inclusion criteria to identify all eligible studies: (1) original articles with full text; (2) the mean/median age of the study population above 18 years; (3) at least one of the outcomes was chest CT imaging features of COVID-19; (4) the number of patients with corresponding imaging features was reported in the study. Studies were excluded if: (1) they lacked corresponding outcome parameters or research data; (2) did not have available full texts. When there were multiple publications from the same population, only data from the most recent report or the study with the larger sample size was included.\n\nWe extracted the following information from each publication: the first author's full name, study sample size, mean/median age, gender distribution, application of \n\nIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, we pooled data using the single arm analysis. Because some proportions extracted from the original data were too high or too low, we transformed the data using the double arcsine method into a normal distribution. We conducted the meta-analysis using the transformed data. The pooled proportion was calculated using the result of the meta-analysis by the formula (P=(sin(tp/2)) 2 ). Statistical heterogeneity between studies was evaluated with Cochran's Q test and the I 2 statistic [4] . For the Q statistic, a p value < 0.10 was considered statistically significant for heterogeneity; for I 2 , a value >50% was considered to have severe heterogeneity. Publication bias was evaluated by constructing a funnel plot and by Egger's test [5] . For Egger's test, a p value < 0.10 was considered to be statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed with Stata SE 13 for Windows.\n\nDetailed search procedures are summarized in Figure 2 . All of the full texts of the 41 identified articles was retrieved for detailed evaluation. Of them, 28 articles did not meet the inclusion criteria, including 6 duplicated populations, 15 case reports/case series, 3 without related data, and 4 review articles. The remaining 13 independent studies were used in the current analysis [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Of these studies, 10 studies reported one or more chest CT imaging signs [6] [7] [8] [10] [11] [12] [14] [15] [16] 18] , 11 studies reported at least one kind of lung distribution [6] [7] [8] 10, 11, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] , 5 studies reported the lobes and total number of lobes involved [7, 9, 11, 15, 16] .\n\nThe 13 studies had 2738 participants with 2386 having abnormal CT imaging features. In the primary meta-analysis, we found that the pooled positive rate of the CT imaging was 89.76% (95%CI: 84.42%, 93.84%) (Figure 3 ). When we excluded the studies without mention of thin-section chest CT, the result was 90.35% (95%CI: 83.68%, 95.42%).\n\nIn this meta-analysis, we found that typical CT imaging appearance for lymphadenopathy (3.38%, 95% CI: 1.00%, 6.86%) respectively (Table 2) .\n\nWe found that most patients with COVID-19 have bilateral lung infection; the incidence was 78.2% (95%CI: 65.69%, 88.19%). When we excluded the studies without mention of thin-section chest CT, bilateral lung infection was seen in 81.80% of patients (95% CI: 73.94%, 88.51%). The lesions were mostly located in the peripheral area (76.95%, 95% CI: 57.43%, 91.50%). Fewer lesions were located in the central (peribronchovascular) area (10.81%, 95% CI: 0.12%, 41.50%) ( Table 2) .\n\nCOVID-19 infection can involve all lobes. In this pooled meta-analysis, we found that the right lower lobe and left lower lobe were the most commonly involved; Table 3 . There was a low probability of publication bias in the following subgroups: GGO mixed consolidation, air bronchogram, crazy paving pattern, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, lymphadenopathy, peripheral, lobe of lesion distribution and number of lobes involved. However, there was publication bias in the subgroup of abnormal GGO, consolidation, and bilateral lung involvement. Because there were only two studies in the subgroup of bronchiectasis, adjacent pleura thickening, central, bilateral upper lobes and bilateral lower lobes, the publication bias could not be evaluated.\n\nOur systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that the proportion of COVID-19 detected by chest CT imaging is very high. The most typical CT imaging finding is GGO. Other common CT features in patients affected by COVID-19 included consolidation, interlobular septal thickening, adjacent pleura thickening, and air bronchograms. More than half of the patients manifested as GGO, consolidation and adjacent pleura thickening. Imaging findings mostly involved the bilateral lungs and were located in the peripheral area of the lungs. The infection can involve all the lobes, and mostly the bilateral lower lobes.\n\nSome patients who had negative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19 at initial presentation may still show chest CT abnormalities [19] . Fang et al reported that the sensitivity of first RT-PCR is 71%, which may be lower than that of chest CT [20] . In our meta-analysis of 2738 cases, the pooled positive rate of CT imaging was 89.76% among patients suspected to have COVID-19.\n\nThus, chest CT plays an important role in the early diagnosis of COVID-19.\n\nIn this analysis, we found that the typical CT features of COVID-19 are GGO and lung consolidation. Some of the GGO were further developed into reticular interlobular septa thickening and \"crazy paving pattern\", indicating that the infection leads to diffuse alveolar edema and interstitial inflammatory [21, 22] . Several patients appeared to have pleural effusion, which may represent a poor prognostic indicator [23] . Generally, viral pneumonias have similar etiological mechanisms and typical imaging findings of COVID-19. Thus, these findings also appear in other viral pneumonia such as the common cold, influenza, and other coronaviruses diseases including SARS and MERS [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] .\n\nSince COVID-19, SARS and MERS all belong to family of coronaviruses, the CT imaging signs are more similar. Still, there appear to be unique imaging characteristics for COVID-19. Unilateral involvement is more common in the early stage of SARS and MERS [29, 30] . In contrast, COVID-19 infection appears to be more commonly bilateral. In this meta-analysis, most patients had bilateral lung involvement, especially the bilateral lower lobes. Overall, 70% of patients had 3 or more lobes involved.\n\nOur meta-analysis has several strengths. First, the number of cases included was relatively large for 3 months of early publications, providing aggregate evidence for evaluating diagnosis of COVID-19 by chest CT. Second, the included studies were conducted in different hospitals and settings, making the results more generalizable.\n\nThird, in this analysis, we extract varieties of different imaging features, including both specific imaging features and distribution patterns in the lungs.\n\nOur meta-analysis also has several limitations. First a majority of the studies included did not distinguish between clinically mild, moderate, and severe patients.\n\nFurthermore, some patients may have co-morbidities and chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension that we cannot account for. These factors may be affect imaging appearances. Second, due to different CT scanners and interpreting radiologists, the reported imaging features may be variable across sites. Due to the proportion of COVID-19 detected by chest CT imaging is very high, especially thin chest CT plays a huge role in assisting diagnosis and follow-up treatment in clinical application.\n\n\u2022 Our systematic review and meta-analysis of the early literature suggests that the proportion of suspected COVID-19 detected by chest CT imaging is high.\n\n\u2022 Chest CT, especially thin-section chest CT can play a central role in early diagnosis of COVID-19.\n\n\u2022 The most common CT features in patients affected by COVID-19 included GGO, consolidation, interlobular septal thickening, adjacent pleura thickening, and air bronchograms.\n\n\u2022 The infection most commonly involves the bilateral lungs, especially bilateral lower lobes.\n\n\u2022 Similar imagine features are seen in other infections, and the final diagnosis of COVID-19 should still be based on RT-PCR."}
