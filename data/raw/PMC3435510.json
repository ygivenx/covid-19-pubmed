{"title": "Toll-like receptors are critical for clearance of Brucella and play different roles in development of adaptive immunity following aerosol challenge in mice", "body": "The genus Brucella is a group of Gram-negative, facultative intracellular bacteria that cause brucellosis, a reproductive disease in ruminants, and undulating fever in humans. Brucellosis is one of the most important worldwide zoonotic diseases. Ten species have been identified to date, three of which, including B. melitensis, B. abortus, and B. suis are virulent in humans and represent a significant threat to public health (Atluri et al., 2011). Humans often become infected following inhalation of particles carrying the bacteria or consumption of dairy products contaminated with the organism. Although vaccination is used to successfully reduce the spread of disease, the risk remains high in underdeveloped nations. There are currently no vaccines available that are safe for use in humans, and although generally effective, antibiotic treatments do not always prevent disease recrudescence. As a result of these factors and concern over their potential weaponization, NIH and the CDC/USDA have classified these three species as category B agents.\n\nBoth innate and adaptive immunity have been described as contributing to the control of Brucella infection (Baldwin and Parent, 2002; Dornand et al., 2002; Baldwin and Goenka, 2006). The role of innate immunity against infection by this pathogen has drawn recent attention as a result of awareness of the role of innate immunity in the establishment of infection and the development of adaptive immunity (Weiss et al., 2005; Oliveira et al., 2011). In contrast, adaptive immunity, including cell-mediated and humoral responses, has been the prominent focus of Brucella research over the past few decades.\n\nThe innate immune system is composed of a variety of cellular and humoral components, which are the first line of the host defense against invading pathogens. Recognition relies on pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed on/in the cellular components of the innate immune system. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the best characterized PRRs. Receptor-ligand interaction via TLRs induces the production of antimicrobial peptides and proinflammatory cytokines through NF-\u03baB, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and other signaling pathways (Kawai and Akira, 2006). As a result, TLR signaling is critical to development of the host innate immune response, including recruitment of dendritic cells (DCs) and T effector cells, and upregulation of MHC I and II on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and by extension adaptive immunity against infection. 10 TLRs in human and 13 in the mouse have been identified to date (Kawai and Akira, 2006). TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR9 recognizing lipopeptide, lipopolysaccharides, flagellin and CpG DNA, respectively, are known to be important in controlling bacterial infections. With the exception of TLR3, the TLRs require the adapter molecule myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) for signal transduction (Kawai and Akira, 2007). As expected, MyD88 have been shown to be essential for clearance of Brucella infection from mice (Weiss et al., 2005; Copin et al., 2007; Macedo et al., 2008).\n\nSeveral groups have investigated the contribution of TLR signaling to innate immunity against Brucella infection in the mouse model. The consensus opinion is that TLR2 is not required to control Brucella infection in the mouse (Campos et al., 2004; Copin et al., 2007). However, TLR2 has been shown to be important for cytokine production (Huang et al., 2003; Giambartolomei et al., 2004; Weiss et al., 2005; Macedo et al., 2008; Zwerdling et al., 2008), MHC-II expression (Barrionuevo et al., 2008) and down regulation of the type I receptor for the Fc portion of IgG (Fc\u03b3RI, CD64) (Barrionuevo et al., 2011) in tissue culture.\n\nThe role of TLR4 in Brucella infection remains controversial. Some studies suggest that TLR4 is required to control Brucella replication in the mouse (Campos et al., 2004; Copin et al., 2007; Macedo et al., 2008); others indicate that TLR4 is not involved (Weiss et al., 2005; Barquero-Calvo et al., 2007). The use of different Brucella strains/species in these experiments may account for the observed differences. The influence of the route of infection on the role of TLRs in studies with other pathogens suggests a need to do so with brucellosis, as is the role of TLR-mediated innate immunity in the development of adaptive immune response. These studies employed intraperitoneal (i.p.) inoculation, which is not a typical route for Brucella infection. As a result of these reports, the consensus of scientific opinion is that MyD88 contributes significantly to the control of Brucella infection while TLR-based signaling plays a lesser role at best. The absence of any role for TLR signaling is consistent with results indicating that the Brucella protein TcpB interrupts TLR\u2013based signaling by promoting degradation of MyD88 adaptor like protein, MAL (Chaudhary et al., 2012), and modification of Brucella LPS reduces agonist activity (Duenas et al., 2004). However, these studies have been restricted to an atypical route of exposure, and the potential for differential TLR expression associated with different tissues has not been considered (Juarez et al., 2010). Since inhalation represents a major concern to public health, experiments were undertaken to determine the role of TLR signaling in the control of Brucella infection following aerosol exposure. The current study, investigates the roles of TLR2, TLR4, and MyD88 in clearance of Brucella following respiratory exposure and development of adaptive immune response against Brucella. Since the mucosal/respiratory system is the primary portal of entry for human infection documented in many laboratory incidents and relevant to biothreats, it is important to understand the pathogenesis and immune responses resulting from aerosol exposure.\n\nSince TLR signaling is an important component bridging innate and adaptive immunity (Iwasaki and Medzhitov, 2004), failure to clear Brucella from organs by TLR signaling deficient mice could be due to defects in the development of adaptive immunity. To test this hypothesis, we determined cellular- and humoral-mediated adaptive immunity in these TLR knockout mice following Brucella infection. The results reveal that TLR signaling exhibits significant differences in control and clearance of Brucella from selected tissues and in the associated development of an adaptive immune response.\n\nThe bacterial strain used in these experiments, B. melitensis 16 M was obtained from ATCC (#23456) and recovered from an aborted goat fetus. Bacterial cultures were prepared as previously described (Pei and Ficht, 2004). Briefly, B. melitensis 16 M was cultured in TSB for 24 h, pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 \u00d7g, washed with and resuspended in PBS (pH 7.4) at a density of approximately 5 \u00d7 109 CFU/ml (Kahl-McDonagh et al., 2007).\n\nBreeding pairs of TLR2\u2212/\u2212, TLR4\u2212/\u2212, and MyD88\u2212/\u2212 mice were obtained from Dr. S. Akira (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) via Dr. Michael Berton (University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX) and colonies maintained by Comparative Medicine Program (CMP) personnel at TAMU. C57BL/6 control mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. All mice were housed in BSL-3 suite in the CMP at Texas A&M University. Mice of both sexes between 8 and 12 weeks old were used in the experiments. Euthanasia was performed using carbon dioxide inhalation. All personnel working with animals received training in rodent handling and euthanasia via the CMP. All animal work was performed in compliance with the Public Health Service (PHS) Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as described by the National Research Council's Institute for Laboratory Animal Research (ILAR) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\nAerosols were generated via nebulization of a Brucella suspension (~5 \u00d7 109 CFU/ml in PBS) into a Madison Chamber (Madison, Wisconsin) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Kahl-McDonagh et al., 2007). The aerosol chamber was located in a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facility in the Laboratory Animal Research and Resources (LARR) building staffed and managed by the CMP at Texas A&M University. To assure personal safety, the principal investigator implemented a strict safety protocol, and all procedures were approved by the IBC and IACUC. Following aerosol exposure, one group of mice (n = 5) were immediately euthanized via carbon dioxide inhalation and the lungs collected to determine the infecting dose (Kahl-McDonagh et al., 2007). At 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks after exposure, mice were euthanized and lung, spleen and liver were collected and homogenized in 1 ml each of sterile water containing 0.5% (v/v) Tween-20. One hundred microliters of appropriate dilution of the homogenized tissue were plated on Farrell's selective medium plates followed by incubation at 37\u00b0C for at least 3 days. The experimental limit of detection was determined to be 10 CFU per lung, spleen or gram of live, and the results described represent the accumulated data from 4 independent aerosol exposures.\n\nAt 8-week post infection (p.i.), one-half of the spleen from each euthanized mouse was used to produce single cell suspensions as previously described. The cell density was adjusted to 2 \u00d7 106 per ml using complete RPMI-1640 containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS, 1 mM non-essential amino acid, 100 \u03bcg/ml of penicillin and 100 U/ml streptomycin. The cell suspension was dispensed to 24-well plates with 1 ml/well and stimulated with heat killed Brucella (HKB) or ConA (2 \u03bcg/ml) for three days. Following stimulation, supernatants were collected and cytokine synthesis characterized. Cells collected from 100 \u03bcl of the suspension were lysed using 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and the LDH released from live cells was determined using CytoTox 96\u2122 Nonradioactive Cytotoxicity Assay kit (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nIFN-\u03b3 levels in the culture supernatants were determined 72 h post stimulation using sandwich ELISA kits (PeproTech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pei et al., 2008).\n\nBlood samples were collected just prior to euthanization from mice at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks post exposure. Sera were separated and anti-Brucella antibodies, including IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, IgM, and IgA were evaluated using ELISA. ELISA plates (Nunc) were coated with B. melitensis 16 M cell lysate. Briefly, 100 \u03bcl of 1 \u03bcg/ml lysate in bicarbonate/carbonate buffer (2.93 g NaHCO3, 1.59 g Na2CO3, 0.203 g MgCl2 in 1 L of distilled water, pH 9.6) was added to microtiter wells (96 wells/plate) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C (Pei and Collisson, 2005). Non-specific binding was blocked via incubation with 5% (w/v) non-fat milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The antigen-coated wells were incubated 2 h at room temperature (25\u00b0C) with mouse sera diluted in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 (PBS-T) 200 times for IgG1, IgG2a, IgM, IgA detection or 1000 times for IgG detection. The plates were then incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins (IgG1, IgG2a, IgM, IgA, and IgG from Kirkegard-Perry Labs (KPL) for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were washed with PBS-T between steps to remove any unbound materials. Color development followed the addition of 100 \u03bcl of TMB substrate KPL. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 \u03bcl of stop buffer (1 M H2SO4) and OD450 was determined using an ELISA reader (Bio-Rad).\n\nStatistical significance was determined using one-way ANOVA or Student's t-test. P-values <0.05* and <0.01** were considered to be significant.\n\nIn these experiments, the infecting dose determined using lungs collected from control C57BL/6 mice (n = 5) immediately following challenge is 4.26 \u00b1 0.28 log CFU/mouse, which is consistent with a previous report (Kahl-McDonagh et al., 2007). Bacterial load recovered from the lungs of TLR2\u2212/\u2212, TLR4\u2212/\u2212, and MyD88\u2212/\u2212 mice during the first two weeks following exposure is not significantly different from the C57BL/6 control mice (Figure 1, panels W1\u20132), indicating that TLR2, TLR4, and MyD88 are not required to clear lung infection early. A significant difference in bacterial burden is detectable by week 4 and extends through week 10, indicating that the contribution of TLR2, TLR4, and MyD88 to the control of Brucella infection in the lungs occurs via adaptive immunity (Figure 1). By week 4 p.i., there was a significant difference in the clearance of the organism from each of the knockouts. This pattern persisted through week 10, although significance is lost due to the reduction in the number of animals available at this time point. The absence of MyD88 appears to have a greater impact on the clearance of infection from the lungs over this period, as the bacterial burden in the lungs of MyD88\u2212/\u2212 mice is significantly higher than that in TLR2\u2212/\u2212 and TLR4\u2212/\u2212 mice by week 8 p.i. (Figure 1, panel W8). The kinetics of Brucella clearance from the lungs is summarized in Figure 1K, and taken together, these results indicate that TLR2, TLR4, and MyD88 contribute to Brucella clearance from the lungs following aerosol challenge.\n\nInfection and the kinetics of clearance of Brucella from the spleens of mice is notably different from that observed in the lung. Initially, the organism exhibits a delay in systemic distribution to the spleen that requires up to 4 weeks to achieve maximum burden. The delay in systemic spread of infection is evident in the spleen and less dramatically in the liver (see below), with bacterial burden in 9 of 13 spleens from TLR4\u2212/\u2212 and 10 of 13 from MyD88\u2212/\u2212 mice below the detection limit (10 cfu/spleen). This compares with a delay in only 1 of 17 TLR2\u2212/\u2212 mice and 5 of 20 C57BL/6 mice. The MyD88\u2212/\u2212 knockout appears to have a reduced ability to control the infection as evidenced by the significant difference in spleen colonization by week 4 (Figure 2, panel W4). Once established infection proceeds similarly, although the MyD88\u2212/\u2212 and TLR4\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit a delay in clearance relative to the TLR2\u2212/\u2212 and C57BL6 mice (Figure 2, panels W6\u201310). Systemic spread and the clearance of infection from the spleen is unaffected by the loss of TLR2, with no significant difference observed between the TLR2\u2212/\u2212/\u2212 and wild-type mice over the course of infection (Figure 2, panels W1\u201310). In contrast, both TLR4\u2212/\u2212 and MyD88\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited early delays in systemic spread of infection during the first week, which is accompanied by a delay in clearance at later times. Again, the exaggerated decline observed between weeks 8 and 10 in TLR4\u2212/\u2212 mice may be an artifact of the reduced animals numbers.\n\nSimilar to the results described for the spleen, systemic spread of the organism to the liver is delayed in TLR4\u2212/\u2212 and MyD88\u2212/\u2212 mice, and is associated with a corresponding delay in the clearance of infection. Here again, TLR2\u2212/\u2212 mice are indistinguishable from control mice in the ability to restrict systemic infection (Figures 2 and 3). As observed in the spleen, the capacity to control infection is most dramatically affected in the MyD88\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 3, panels W1\u201310). From week 2 and onward, TLR2\u2212/\u2212 and TLR4\u2212/\u2212 mice controlled infection and cleared the organisms from the livers indistinguishably from the C57BL/6 mice (Figure 3, panel W10). Taken together, these results reveal that, in the mouse liver; (1) TLR2 and TLR4 are not required to control infection or clearance; (2) the absence of TLR4 reduces accumulation of Brucella in the liver, but has little effect on late stage clearance; (3) MyD88 is critical in early control and late clearance of the organism.\n\nTo determine the development of cell-mediated immunity, the splenocytes collected at 8 weeks p.i. from knockout and control mice are stimulated with Brucella antigen ex vivo. Using an LDH release assay to measure lymphocyte proliferation, no significant differences in proliferation was detected for TLR2\u2212/\u2212, TLR4\u2212/\u2212, MyD88\u2212/\u2212 and control C57BL/6 mice (Figure 4A). This result indicates that cell-mediated adaptive immunity against Brucella is unimpaired in these knockout mice. Consistent with the results of the lymphocyte proliferation assay, IFN-\u03b3 levels detected in splenocyte supernatants collected from the knockout mice are not significantly different from C57BL/6 mice (Figure 4B).\n\nTo determine the role of TLR signaling in antibody production and isotype switching, anti-Brucella IgM, IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgA responses were determined following aerosol infection. The results presented reveal detectable levels of IgM by 2 weeks p.i. that peaks by 4 weeks p.i. (Figure 5, panel A). IgM levels begin to decline in the MyD88\u2212/\u2212 and C57BL/6 mice at 4 weeks p.i. while, IgM levels in the TLR2\u2212/\u2212 and TLR4\u2212/\u2212 mice plateau at 4 weeks with a gradual decline by 10 weeks p.i. Any requirement for TLR2 and TLR4 in IgM production is transient (only at 4 weeks p.i.). and IgM levels were never significantly different between MyD88\u2212/\u2212 and C57BL/6 mice throughout the experiment.\n\nTotal Brucella-specific IgG in wild-type mice is detectable starting 4 weeks post-infection (Figure 5, panel B), and increases continuously over the next 6 weeks. In contrast, elevation of the Brucella specific IgG levels is delayed in all of the knockout mice. Comparison among the groups revealed that, between weeks 4 and 8 p.i., IgG levels in TLR2\u2212/\u2212 and TLR4\u2212/\u2212 mice are significantly lower than that observed in the C57BL/6 mice. IgG levels increase in TLR4\u2212/\u2212 and TLR2\u2212/\u2212 mice by 10 weeks p.i. to levels that are not significantly different from the control C57BL/6 mice. In contrast, IgG levels in MyD88\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit a significant reduction in titer over the course of infection. Serum IgA is not detected in the TLR2\u2212/\u2212 and TLR4\u2212/\u2212 mice, nor in C57BL/6 mice out to week 10 (Figure 5, panel C). Interestingly, serum IgA is prominent in the sera of MyD88\u2212/\u2212 mice and continuously increases over the course of the experiment.\n\nRecent studies have shown that TLRs play a critical role in determining the fate of naive T cells, directing them toward either Th1 or Th2 responses (Dabbagh and Lewis, 2003; Xu et al., 2004). To characterize the role of TLR signaling in determining a Th1 or Th2 response, IgG1 (Th2) and IgG2a (Th1) levels and the IgG1/IgG2a ratio are calculated following Brucella aerosol exposure. IgG1 and IgG2a production are above background levels only 8 weeks p.i. (Figure 5, panels D and E). By week 10, TLR2 and C57BL/6 mice produce significantly elevated levels of IgG1 (Figure 5, panel D) indicating TLR2 is not required for IgG1 production. In contrast, IgG1 levels in TLR4 and MyD88 knockout mice are significantly reduced, indicating TLR4 and MyD88 are essential for IgG1 production (Figure 5, panel D). Relatively low levels of IgG2a are present at 10 weeks p.i. in all groups, but IgG2a levels in TLR2 and MyD88 knockout mice are significantly reduced relative to control mice. IgG1/IgG2a ratios suggesting Th2-skewed immune responses are induced in TLR2\u2212/\u2212, MyD88\u2212/\u2212 and C57BL/6 mice. The Th2 response in TLR2 knockout mice is significantly elevated compared to wild type mice at 10 weeks p.i. (Figure 5, panel F), indicating TLR2 interactions suppress Th2 response following aerosol infection.\n\nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
