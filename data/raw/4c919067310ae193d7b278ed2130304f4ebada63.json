{"title": "50 Fever in the Returned Traveler Individual Factors", "body": "\u2022 Geographic distribution: Risk varies with country and environment (e.g., urban or rural, mountains or coastal plains). Although malaria is the most common infection diagnosed in travelers returned from sub-Saharan Africa, dengue is more prevalent in travelers returning from Southeast Asia and enteric fever from southcentral Asia (see Table 150 .1). \u2022 Incubation period: Most travelers become symptomatic within 21 days of exposure, with the majority presenting within 1 month of return. However, some pathogens have a much longer incubation period (e.g., Plasmodium vivax and tuberculosis); patients can present months or, rarely, years later (Table 150. 2).\n\nPatients can present with undifferentiated fever or with organspecific symptoms, such as gastroenteritis or respiratory infection. For more detailed descriptions, relevant chapters on specific infections should be consulted.\n\nMalaria is a potentially fatal infection in travelers returning from the tropics, particularly from sub-Saharan Africa. 5 It should be excluded in all travelers with a history of fever. The risk of travelers acquiring malaria outside sub-Saharan Africa has decreased substantially in recent years, especially in those from India and South America. 6 Most short-term travelers present within 1 month of return; however, P. falciparum occasionally presents up to 6 months later, and P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae can present a year or more after return. 7 Many travelers do not take chemoprophylaxis, or take it inadequately. 4 When malaria is acquired despite chemoprophylaxis, the onset of symptoms is often delayed, severity of illness reduced, and microbiologic diagnosis may be obscured. 8 Chemoprophylaxis can obscure the diagnosis, so in\n\n\u2022 Travel, especially to low-income regions, is associated with an increased risk of infections not typically seen in high-income countries (e.g., malaria, enteric fever, dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and schistosomiasis). \u2022 Although gastroenteritis, respiratory tract infections, and self-limiting viral infections are common, a minority of patients will have a potentially life-threatening tropical infection. \u2022 The evaluation of an ill returned traveler requires a detailed travel history with an understanding of the geographic distribution of infections, risk factors for acquisition, incubation periods, clinical presentations, and appropriate laboratory investigations. \u2022 A syndromic approach to specific investigations, and to presumptive therapy pending laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis, is appropriate. \u2022 Travel is also a risk factor for acquisition of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, such as those containing extended spectrum \u03b2-lactamases, that become part of the traveler's colonizing flora.\n\npresenting with a fever who have visited the tropics.\n\nUp to 70% of travelers to low-income regions report health problems, the majority of which are self-limiting; however 8% to 15% of travelers are ill enough to seek medical attention while abroad or on return home, with fever a common presenting complaint. [1] [2] [3] The etiology is often a self-limiting, globally endemic infection, such as influenza or gastroenteritis; however, conditions not normally seen in the patient's country of origin are increasingly seen. These can be life threatening, such as malaria, and others can have public health consequences, such as enteric fever.\n\nTo evaluate febrile returned travelers, it is necessary to have an understanding of the geographic distribution of infections, risk factors for acquisition, incubation periods, and clinical presentations. A risk assessment can then be made, initial investigations instigated, and, when appropriate, presumptive therapy started.\n\nThe epidemiology of fever in returned travelers reflects factors relating to the individual traveler and to the wide spectrum of etiologic pathogens. Many pathogens-for example, influenza-have a global distribution; however, others are only found in distinct geographic locations. Among patients with undifferentiated fever, malaria, dengue, and enteric fever are the most common tropical diagnoses. 3 The following factors influence an individual's risk of acquiring infection (Table 150.1). 4 cough. Complications occur mainly with P. falciparum infection but can also occur after infection with P. vivax and P. knowlesi. In patients with confusion, seizures, or reduced consciousness level, cerebral malaria or hypoglycemia should be considered; hypoxia, tachypnea, and signs of pulmonary edema indicate respiratory involvement.\n\ncases where malaria is thought likely, chemoprophylaxis can be stopped while patients are investigated. 5 Nearly all patients with malaria give a history of fever; however, up to half are afebrile on presentation, although specific fever patterns are uncommon. 9 Headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and malaise are frequently described, and some patients report diarrhea or Rickettsiae have an incubation period of 5 to 7 days (up to 10 days) and similar presentations. More than 80% of patients infected with R. africae or R. conorii describe fever, headache, and myalgia. The classic signs of inoculation eschar, rash, and lymphadenitis are seen in <50%; however, retrospective cohorts report higher rates ( Fig. 150.1 ). 11 Complications (e.g., reactive arthritis) are rarely encountered in African tick typhus; mortality rates of up to 32% have been reported for Mediterranean tick bite fever, 17% for scrub typhus, and 4% for murine typhus. [12] [13] [14] \n\nThere are over 500 arthropod-borne viruses worldwide, although not all cause human disease. The majority are usually restricted to specific geographic locations; for example, Ross River virus in Australia. However, due to a combination of international travel and changes in vector distribution there have been changes in the distribution of many arboviruses. They have short incubation periods (<1 week) and result in self-limiting illnesses. Four clinical presentations predominate:\n\n\u2022 Systemic febrile illness (e.g., all arboviruses) \u2022 Hemorrhagic fever (e.g., dengue, yellow fever, Rift Valley fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever) \u2022 Acute encephalitis (e.g., Japanese encephalitis, Rift Valley fever, West Nile virus, Eastern and Western equine encephalitis viruses) \u2022 Polyarthralgia or arthritis (e.g., chikungunya, Ross River) Dengue is the most common arbovirus in travelers. Although widespread, it is a cause of fever mainly in those returning from Asia, the Caribbean, and South America. 15 Most travelers present with a febrile illness associated with headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia (especially back pain), and rash. 15 The rash, initially erythrodermic, becomes petechial with disease progression (Fig. 150.2) . Hepatitis, myocarditis, encephalitis, and neuropathy can occur. Bleeding gums, epistaxis, and gastrointestinal bleeding occur but are not necessarily indicative of dengue hemorrhagic fever, which, like dengue shock syndrome, is rare in travelers.\n\nChikungunya has a distribution similar to dengue with large epidemics in the Caribbean, South America, India, and Southeast Asia. 16 The clinical presentation is similar to classic dengue fever; however, arthralgia is more prominent. In the majority of cases, Enteric Fever (Salmonella Typhi, S. Paratyphi) Enteric fever is a potentially life-threatening infection that requires early diagnosis and management. It is seen particularly in VFR travelers returning from Asia, 3 although there have been outbreaks in Malawi and Kenya, and this may translate into more imported cases. 10 With an incubation period of 7 to 18 days (range up to 60 days), most patients present within a month of return. A history of vaccination pre-travel has little predictive value; it provides incomplete protection against S. Typhi and no protection against S. Paratyphi.\n\nIn addition to fever, symptoms include headache, constipation/ diarrhea, and dry cough. Complications, in particular encephalopathy and gastrointestinal bleeding and intestinal perforation, occur infrequently; they are more likely if the duration of illness is >2 weeks.\n\nThe most common travel-associated rickettsial infections are due to Rickettsia africae (African tick typhus). Endemic throughout sub-Saharan Africa, it is a common diagnosis in those who have visited game parks in southern Africa. R. conorii (Mediterranean spotted \n\nAmebic liver abscess 23 should be considered in all patients with fever and a raised right hemi-diaphragm on chest radiography. It has a higher prevalence in developing countries. Travelers, exposed through fecal-oral transmission, will often present weeks to months after return (incubation period: 8-20 weeks). Most patients report fever, often localized abdominal pain, and hepatomegaly. Only 20% give a history of dysentery, and only 10% have diarrhea at presentation.\n\nBrucellosis 24 is acquired through ingestion of unpasteurized milk, although transmission can occur after direct contact with animal parts or, in laboratories, through inhalation of aerosolized particles. It has a global distribution, with a higher prevalence in the Middle East, Balkans, former USSR, the Mediterranean, and South America. Symptoms develop 2 to 4 weeks after exposure (up to 6 months) and vary from an acute febrile illness to a chronic low-grade relapsing fever; signs include lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly. Complications of brucellosis are common-in particular, large-joint septic arthritis, sacroiliitis, and, less commonly, spondylitis of the lumbar spine. Other complications include epididymo-orchitis, septic abortion, neurologic involvement (meningitis, encephalitis, and abscess), and endocarditis.\n\nQ fever 25 is rarer than brucellosis, although it has a similar clinical history. It has a global distribution, with most cases related to occupational exposure, usually through inhalation of aerosolized particles. Community outbreaks, as reported in the Netherlands in 2008, occur. 26 Most cases are asymptomatic; symptomatic patients present with fever, pneumonia, or hepatitis after exposure to farms or animals. Complications, including chronic infection, are well described, particularly endocarditis.\n\nBetween 5% and 51% of short-term travelers take part in casual sex while abroad, with higher rates reported in long-term travelers. 27 Many STIs present as a febrile illness, including HIV seroconversion, secondary syphilis ( Fig. 150.3) , and gonorrhea. People living the arthralgia settles; 5% to 30% develop chronic arthropathy with pain, stiffness and swelling lasting months to years. 17, 18 Zika virus has caused large outbreaks in the Caribbean, South and Central America, and the Pacific and is increasingly reported in Asia. 19 Acutely, the disease is similar to dengue. However, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome can be a complication, and during pregnancy Zika can lead to stillbirth and is associated with congenital abnormalities, including fetal microcephaly. Sexual transmission of Zika is well described. 19 No clinical features reliably distinguish dengue, chikungunya, and Zika infection, although thrombocytopenia is normally more pronounced in dengue. 20 Large outbreaks of yellow fever continue to occur in both Africa and South America and may be associated with an increased risk of imported cases among travelers.\n\nThis should be considered in febrile travelers returning from Africa. Travelers give a history of freshwater exposure 4 to 6 weeks (up to 9) before symptom onset. Some describe a self-resolving itchy rash immediately after exposure (swimmer's itch). Symptoms and signs include fever, lethargy, myalgia, arthralgia, cough, wheeze, headache, urticarial rash, diarrhea, and hepatosplenomegaly. 21 The eosinophil count is usually elevated with acute schistosomiasis and provides supportive evidence for the diagnosis, but it may only appear a few days after symptom onset. Acute symptoms are self-limiting in most cases.\n\nLeptospirosis has a global distribution. Infection occurs after exposure to rodent or dog urine-contaminated freshwater; for example, through recreational water sports, flooding, or occupation. After an incubation period of 7 to 12 days, patients classically present with a biphasic illness: a bacteremic phase with flulike symptoms lasting 4 to 7 days, followed 1 to 3 days later by an immune phase of fever, myalgia, hepatorenal syndrome, and hemorrhage. 22 The severe end of the spectrum, Weil's disease, occurs infrequently but has a case fatality rate of 10% to 15%. Gastrointestinal and respiratory presentations and meningitis, myocarditis, and pancreatitis are occasionally described. \u2022 Fever, respiratory symptoms, and peripheral eosinophilia:\n\nConsider Loeffler's syndrome (Ascaris, hookworm, Strongyloides), acute schistosomiasis, tropical pulmonary eosinophilia (filaria), leaking hydatid cyst, visceral larva migrans, and paragonimiasis. 31\n\nTravelers' diarrhea has a reported incidence of at least 200 cases/1000 ill returned travelers. 3 Fever is self-reported in one third of these patients. Specific pathogens vary according to destination, setting, and season; however, enteric bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Shigella, are the most common. In up to 50%, no pathogen is identified. The combination of fever and bloody diarrhea is suggestive of bacterial or amebic dysentery, with the latter (uncommon in the returning traveler) often having a more indolent onset. Empiric antibiotics can be considered (see later). Any systemic febrile infection can have diarrhea at presentation; for example, severe sepsis, malaria, and pneumococcal pneumonia.\n\nEnteric fever, amebic liver abscess, viral hepatitis, and, rarely, leaking or secondarily infected hydatid cysts can cause fever and abdominal pain.\n\nInfections presenting with fever and jaundice are listed in Table  150 .3.\n\nNeurologic presentations, including meningitis and encephalitis, are reported in 15/1000 ill returned travelers. 3 Cerebral malaria can present with encephalopathy, meningismus, seizures, or focal signs and should always be excluded.\n\nTypical bacterial and viral causes should be considered. Causes of predominantly lymphocytic meningitis include arboviruses, brucellosis, leptospirosis, Lyme disease, Q fever, relapsing fevers, syphilis, tuberculosis, HIV seroconversion, and HIV-related opportunistic infections (e.g., cryptococcal meningitis). Some infections, such as enteric fever, rarely present with meningismus but the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is normal.\n\nIn addition to typical causes of encephalitis, travel-related causes are arboviruses (e.g., West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis, tickborne encephalitis), brucellosis, rabies, rickettsial infections, African trypanosomiasis, and tuberculosis. African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) has been described in travelers returning from game parks in East and Central Africa, including Tanzania, Malawi, and Zambia.\n\nIt is necessary to understand the epidemiology of specific pathogens and to obtain the travel history, including geographic destinations visited, dates of risk exposures, time of onset, and duration of with HIV who travel to the tropics can be at increased risk of opportunistic infections (see Table 150 .1). 28\n\nRespiratory tract infections are diagnosed as the underlying cause of febrile illness in 7% to 24% of returning travelers. 4 These include sinusitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, bronchitis, influenza, pneumonia, and pulmonary eosinophilia. Influenza is the most common vaccine-preventable infection acquired by travelers. The following are clinical and epidemiologic associations (see diseasespecific chapters for details). 150.8). When tuberculosis is considered, it is essential that adequate samples of sputum or tissue for mycobacteria culture are obtained. Tuberculin skin tests and interferon-gamma release assays have a limited role in evaluation of patients with chronic fever. Rarely, fever may be due to a viral hemorrhagic fever such as Lassa, Ebola, Marburg, or Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. The diagnosis should be considered in travelers who have visited endemic regions within 21 days of symptom onset, 32,33 in particular, travel to rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa (particularly west and symptoms. 4 The geography of exposure helps determine which infections the traveler may have been exposed to, and illness onset and symptoms help to estimate the incubation period (see Tables  150.1 \n\nMany infections have similar clinical presentations; however, certain symptoms and signs can give clues; relevant examination findings include rash, eschar, hepatosplenomegaly, and jaundice (Tables 150.3 , 150.4, and 150.5). Table 150 .6 lists the differential diagnosis in patients with chronic fever (>2 weeks) and is a reminder that non-infectious causes are seen in this group.\n\nTravelers presenting with undifferentiated fever should have initial investigations (Table 150 .7); following these, specific studies may be appropriate, depending on the differential diagnosis ( Table   TABLE 150 \n\n\u2022 Perform in all patients who have visited a tropical country within 1 year of presentation \u2022 The sensitivity of a thick film read by an expert is equivalent to that of an RDT; however, blood films are necessary for speciation and parasite count \u2022 Three thick films/RDTs over 72 hours (as an outpatient if appropriate) should be performed to exclude malaria with confidence \u2022 Positive blood films (thick and thin) should be sent to the reference laboratory for confirmation \u2022 Patients returned from Asia (particularly Malaysia) with a high P. malariae parasite count should have the potentially lethal P. knowlesi excluded by PCR Complete blood count \u2022 Lymphopenia: common in viral infection (dengue, HIV) and typhoid \u2022 Eosinophilia (>0.45 \u00d7 10 9 /L): incidental findings or indicative of infectious (e.g., parasitic, fungal) or non-infectious cause (see Table 150 .8) \u2022 Thrombocytopenia: malaria, dengue, acute HIV, typhoid; also seen in severe sepsis\n\n\u2022 Two sets should be taken before any antibiotic therapy \u2022 Sensitivity of up to 80% in typhoid \u2022 Notify the laboratory if the diagnosis of brucellosis is being considered Liver function tests See CXR \u00b1 liver U/S CXR, Chest x-ray; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RDT, rapid diagnostic test; U/S, ultrasound; VHF, viral hemorrhagic fever. *As an infection control precaution, the diagnosis of VHF should be considered and excluded before performing blood tests. \u2020 To ensure that the correct tests are done, an adequate travel history must be documented on request forms. This includes locations visited, dates of travel, dates of symptom onset, and risk activities undertaken. Pathogen-specific request forms may be required by reference laboratory for some infections (e.g., dengue and other arbovirus). Table adapted with permission from British Infection Society. Fever in returned travelers presenting in the United Kingdom: recommendations for investigation and initial management. 5 These infections can be severe and have implications for nosocomial transmission. Diagnosis is by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of blood, which should be performed prior to further investigations (which might result in exposure of health care staff); malaria must be excluded. A high index of suspicion, close liaison with specialists, and transfer to a specialist facility are usually necessary to manage these patients. One diagnostic strategy is to perform a standard \"geographic panel\" of diagnostic tests, based purely on the travel history, in all febrile patients in whom malaria has been excluded. This approach may reduce the likelihood that less common diagnoses are missed if a clinician does not consider them, but may also increase testing costs.\n\nThe relevant chapters should be consulted for detailed advice on the treatment of individual infections. Presumptive treatment may sometimes be started (see Table 150 .8). 4\n\nParasitic confirmation (smears, rapid diagnostic tests [RDTs], or PCR) of suspected malaria is preferred, and empiric treatment is not recommended in clinical settings with good diagnostic facilities. However, diagnostic results must be accurate, timely, and available. Accuracy depends on the skills of the microscopist; RDT and PCR results reflect the performance characteristics of the assay. RDTs have high sensitivity for P. falciparum but can be lower for non-falciparum malaria. Presumptive treatment is not recommended, and facilities managing returning travelers should ensure an accurate diagnostic test result can be obtained within 6 hours.\n\nMetronidazole 750 mg three times daily for 7 to 10 days or tinidazole 2 g daily for 3 days should be started empirically in patients with an appropriate travel history, clinical presentation, imaging, and, where available, serology (can be falsely negative in early disease). Most patients demonstrate clinical improvement and resolution of fever within 48 to 72 hours. The main differential diagnosis is a pyogenic liver abscess; patients with sepsis require broad-spectrum antibiotics until the diagnosis is confirmed. Surgical or percutaneous drainage is rarely required and should only be considered if there is diagnostic uncertainty, symptoms persist after 4 days of treatment, or there is imminent risk of rupture into critical sites (e.g., left-lobe abscess rupturing into the pericardium). 34 After treatment, patients should be given 10 days of a luminal amebicide to prevent relapse: diloxanide furoate (500 mg orally three times daily) or paromomycin (30 mg/kg orally in three divided doses).\n\nWhen there is a strong suspicion, a parenteral third-generation cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone) can be commenced pending blood culture results. Fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates are reported in patients returning from Asia, but so far have been rarely reported in those returning from Africa. 35 Ciprofloxacin 750 mg twice daily remains the treatment of choice for fully sensitive isolates. Azithromycin 1 g followed by 500 mg daily should be used as follow-on therapy where fluoroquinolone resistance is suspected or confirmed. Regardless of which antibiotic is used, fever can take time to resolve; failure to defervesce is not a reason to change antibiotics when the isolate is confirmed as sensitive.\n\nDue to the potential severity of the illness, the non-specific nature of initial investigations, and a minimum period of 6 to 10 days before confirmatory serology becomes available, a 5-to 7-day course of penicillin (benzylpenicillin 1.5 million units four times daily) or doxycycline (100 mg twice daily) should be considered in patients with a flulike illness within 7 to 12 days of freshwater exposure.\n\nFever and headache, with or without rash, developing within 10 days of exposure to ticks in southern African game parks should prompt treatment with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily while other infections are excluded. A response is expected within 24 to 48 hours.\n\nEmpiric treatment should be offered to travelers presenting with fever, urticarial rash, and eosinophilia (>0.45 \u00d7 10 9 /L) within 4 to 8 weeks of freshwater exposure. 31 Praziquantel 40 mg/kg in a divided dose 4 hours apart will kill mature, but not immature, schistosomes (Schistosoma japonicum: 60 mg/kg in three divided doses). Treatment should therefore be given at the time of diagnosis but repeated 6 to 8 weeks later. Corticosteroids can help alleviate acute symptoms.\n\nInternational travel, particularly to India, the Middle East, and Africa, is associated with an increased risk of acquiring extendedspectrum \u03b2-lactamase-producing gram-negative pathogens. 36 This should be taken into account when empiric antibiotics are indicated."}
