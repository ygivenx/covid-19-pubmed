{"title": "ORIGINAL ARTICLE 102 Mask-wearing and respiratory infection in healthcare workers in Beijing, China", "body": "Influenza pandemic has been a global public health issue in recent years, 1 and in 2009, a pandemic of a novel H1N1 influenza virus of swine origin occurred. 2, 3 During the initial stages of an influenza pandemic, supplies of vaccines and antiviral medications are likely to be delayed or inadequate to treat a very large number of affected individuals. Therefore, non-pharmacological interventions will be important, including the use of respirators and/or medical masks, which is able to confer respiratory protection. [4] [5] [6] If hospitals are to continue to function adequately during a pandemic, reliable access to effective protection strategies for healthcare workers (HCWs) will be imperative. Reducing transmission to HCWs may not only help support the healthcare workforce, but may also prevent influenza transmission to patients. 7 It is commonly acknowledged that adherence with an intervention can change with perception of risk during a pandemic or an out-break of unknown origin. Since the epidemic of SARS in Beijing in 2003, awareness and commitment to infection control increased, including the use of masks among HCWs. However, we are not aware of the exact rate of and adherence to mask-wearing after the SARS outbreak in 2003. Furthermore, we commonly assume that frontline HCWs are at increased risk of respiratory infection, but to the best of our knowledge there is no data examining this in our setting. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to determine the level of mask-wearing and respiratory infection in healthcare workers during an influenza season in Beijing, China.\n\nBetween April 20, 2008 and May 15, 2008, we undertook a survey to examine the level of mask-wearing and respiratory infection in HCWs from eight hospitals, in Beijing, China. If we assumed that the proportion of HCWs Este \u00e9 um artigo Open Access sob a licen\u00e7a de CC BY-NC-ND with good mask-wearing adherence (wearing the mask for \u2265 70% of patient-contact time) was equal to 50%, a 5% precision, with a 95% confidence interval according to the formula stated by Daniel, 8 the required sample size for this survey would be 384 HCWs. Eventually, 400 HCWs were enrolled. These 400 HCWs came from a range of different departments and wards representing high and low risk settings for respiratory infection (respiratory, emergency, infectious disease and surgical departments) of eight hospitals in Beijing, using a two-stage random sampling technique. For this study, we classified the first three wards/departments as being high-risk settings for respiratory pathogen transmission and the surgical department as being low risk. In the first stage, eight hospitals were randomly selected from 23 level 2 or 3 hospitals in Beijing. In China, hospitals are categorized into three levels (Level 1, 2 and 3) according to the magnitude (Level 3 > Level 2 > Level 1). 9 In the second stage, for each selected hospital, 50 subjects were randomly enrolled in this survey from respiratory, emergency, infectious disease and surgical departments.\n\nUsing a standardized questionnaire, we developed a survey that assessed: demographic characteristics; professional designation and clinical duties; attitude and adherence to mask-wearing, mask types used; hand washing frequency, seasonal influenza vaccination; and respiratory infection (clinical respiratory illness [CRI], defined as having at least two of the following symptoms simultaneously: fever, cough, sore throat, nasal congestion or rhinorrhea) 10 Attitude to mask-wearing was assessed by asking the following question: Do you think it is necessary to wear masks when in contact with patients? Attitude was categorized as active (necessary to wear masks when in contact with patients) and not active (not necessary to wear masks when in contact with patients).\n\nMask-wearing adherence was measured by the following question: for what percentage of patient-contact time did you wear a mask or respirator? According to expert opinion, adherence was categorized as good (wearing the mask for \u2265 70% of patient-contact time) and poor (wearing the mask for < 70% of patient-contact time).\n\nHand washing frequency was assessed by asking the following question: Do you think it is necessary to wash hands after contact with each patient? Frequency was categorized as frequent (necessary to wash hands after contact with each patient) and not frequent (not necessary to wash hands after contact with each patient).\n\nQuestionnaire data were entered in duplicate using EpiData Software, and data were analyzed using SPSS 11.5 statistical package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine predictors of mask-wearing adherence and respiratory infection in HCWs. Predictive factors were first analyzed by univariate analysis, and then factors with p-values < 0.5 or those that were thought to be clinically significant by professional view were included in the multivariable model; backward logistic regression was conducted by removing variables with p > 0.1. For all statistical analyses two-tailed tests were used, and statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05.\n\nAll 400 subjects selected for this survey participated in and completed the study. The median age was 35 years and about 81% (324/400) were female. About 47.8 % (191/400) were doctors, and 52.2% (209/400) were nurses; 52.7% (211/400) were classified as being in a junior role, and 80% (320/400) were working in high-risk settings. About 28.5% (114/400) reported having taken seasonal influenza vaccination. Detailed demographic characteristics of the subjects are reported in Table 1 .\n\nAll subjects (100%) reported mask use. The majority (70%, 280/400) of participants self reported good adherence with masks. About 84.0% (336/400) reported adverse effects of mask-wearing, and 43.0% (172/400) reported more than two adverse effects ( Table 2 ). The most commonly reported adverse effect was breathing difficulties (56.5%, 226/400). The washable, reusable cotton-yarn mask was the most common type of mask used as reported by participants (59.8%, 239/400), followed by medical masks (40.2%, 161/400). Close to 60% of participants reported having had clinical respiratory illness (59.5%, 238/400) during the influenza season. (Table 2 ).\n\nMultivariate analysis showed that good mask-wearing adherence was higher among females (odds ratio [ \n\nIn our study, we found high self-reported mask adherence, despite the majority of HCWs having reported adverse effects of mask-wearing. This high level of mask-wearing adherence may be attributed to enhanced management of nosocomial infection control and improved consciousness among HCWs following the SARS outbreak in Beijing in 2003, especially after the occurrence of SARS infection in HCWs. 11 We found that the majority of our participants used re-usable cotton-yarn masks, followed by medical masks. N95 masks were not reported as being used routinely. It may be hypothesized that the cost of N95 masks may be a potential barrier for their use in these wards, and departments prefer to re-usable cotton-yarn masks which could be considered as more economically viable in the setting of limited funding/resources. *Mask-wearing adherence was categorized into two groups: good adherence (wearing the mask for \u2265 70% of patient-contact time) and poor adherence (wearing the mask for < 70% of patient-contact time). \u2021 Defined as having at least two of the following symptoms simultaneously: fever, cough, sore throat, nasal congestion or rhinorrhea. In this study, female and junior/intermediate HCWs had better adherence to mask-wearing than their counterparts, which may be due to better consciousness of self-protection of females and junior/intermediate HCWs who are much more prone to comply with the hospital infection control policies. HCWs of level 3 hospitals had higher level of adherence to mask-wearing, compared to their counterparts in level 2 facilities. This may be due to the stricter and more complete regulations of infection control in larger hospitals.\n\nHCWs from high risk departments were found to have higher levels of adherence with mask-wearing, compared to their counterparts from low risk areas. This may be due to increased awareness of risk in these departments. We found that it did not matter if the staff member was working in a high or low risk department, anyone who had a \"positive attitude\" to mask-wearing also had good adherence with mask-wearing. In our study, participants who reported frequent hand-washing were also found to have good adherence with mask-wearing.\n\nIn this study close to 60% of participants self-reported having a respiratory infection during the influenza season. Surprisingly, there was no significant difference between rates reported among participants of high risk areas and those from low risk areas. This finding suggested that healthcare workers working in low risk areas had the same risk of respiratory infection as those in high risk areas in Beijing hospitals.\n\nWe are unsure why females had a higher reported rate of infection -a possible explanation could be that female healthcare workers have closer patient contact than their male counterparts. The level 3 hospital represented the higher risk of respiratory infection compared to level 2 facilities suggesting that level 3 hospitals, which have larger population of sick patients, are a priority for measures to protect health care workers.\n\nThe coverage of seasonal influenza vaccination is always of concern, especially in HCWs. [12] [13] [14] In this survey, we found that 28.5% (114/400) of participants were vaccinated, and seasonal influenza vaccination showed a protective effect, underscoring the importance of seasonal influenza vaccination for HCWs.\n\nThis study showed that HCWs with good adherence to mask-wearing were at lower risk of respiratory infection, which indicates the protective effect of masks, also found in previous studies. [4] [5] [6] 15 The protective efficacy of masks/respirators is provided through a combined effect of transmission blocking potential, the fit and related air leakage of the mask/respirator, and the consistency in the use of masks/ respirators. Their efficacy is graded on the level of protection the material offers, assuming a perfect fit and optimal compliance. 16 Medical masks are designed to protect the environment from respiratory droplets produced by the wearer. Research studies on the filtration and fit of medical masks show wide variation in penetration of aerosol particles (4% to 90%) and a higher amount of face seal leakage when compared to respirators. 17 The fit of cloth masks/cottonyarn masks, which are widely used in Asia, is likely to be even looser than medical masks and hence, cloth masks are likely to have a lower level of protection, suggested by the higher efficacy of medical masks found in this study. In addition, reuse of cloth masks may lead to contamination, which adds to the risk of respiratory infection. But there are no clinical data associated with cloth masks currently.\n\nThere are a number of limitations in this study. Firstly, information regarding vaccine uptake, frequency of masks/ respirators use, frequency of hand washing and cases of respiratory infection were all based on self-report. This study is therefore subject to problems of recall bias, and final results may be overestimated. Another limitation is that we cannot comment on whether HCWs who reported a respiratory infection were infected in or out of the hospital setting.\n\nDespite these limitations, we provide the first quantitative estimate of mask-wearing and respiratory infection among HCWs in Beijing during the influenza season after the SARS outbreak in 2003."}
