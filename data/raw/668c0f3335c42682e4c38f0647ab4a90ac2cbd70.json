These investigators also observed sure. [1, 2, 15, 25] The illness generally begins with a prodrome of fever, the duration of time from the onset of illness until the evolution of often associated with chills, rigors and myalgia. Headache and various endpoints of their disease: fever, 0.3 days; admission to the severe malaise may accompany this phase; rash has been absent in most cases. In one outbreak within an apartment complex in Hong Kong, diarrhea was found in 66% of cases. [1] After a typical period of 3-7 days, a lower respiratory phase may begin with the onset of non-productive cough and progressive pneumonia. In the initial reports of cases, 20-30% of patients required intensive care unit management and mechanical ventilation. The presenting symptoms of patients admitted to the hospital from four published series are listed in table II. [8, [21] [22] [23] Most patients were admitted to the hospital several days after the onset of symptoms. The most common complaints were fever and chills or rigors. Upper respiratory tract symptoms such as rhinorrhea and sore throat were less common. At the time of examination, abnormal auscultatory findings were present in about one-third of patients.\n\nAlthough fever and progressive respiratory manifestations are a hallmark of most cases of SARS, patients with more indolent characteristics (including absence of fever) have been describedespecially in elderly or immunocompromised patients. [1, 26] The first report of a complete outbreak of SARS (from beginning of the outbreak until declaration of containment) was recently published by Vu et al.

However, if acute and convalescent phase sera are tive factors for intensive care unit admission, and death. On collected at least 8-10 days apart, a 4-fold or greater rise in different RT-PCR assays performed on different specimen aliquots identify the coronavirus RNA. [33] Because of the possibility of false-negative cultures and RT-PCR assays, only the absence of antibody in a serum specimen obtained >21 days after symptom onset is considered by the CDC to be a negative laboratory test for SARS coronavirus.\n\nThe likelihood of detecting SARS-CoV is increased if multiple specimens (e.g. stool, serum, respiratory tract specimens) are collected during the course of illness. Clinicians should consult with their local laboratory personnel and health department about obtaining such tests. The priority of specimens for SARS-CoV testing and optimal timing for collection are presented in table III.\n\nOf the 50 patients with clinical SARS described by Peiris et al., [8] 45 had serological or PCR evidence of SARS-associated coronavirus infection; and of the 5 who were unconfirmed, 4 had serological testing prior to 14 days of onset of illness (possibly prior to the time of seroconversion). Another series of 72 cases in Hong Kong showed that despite significantly high dosages of corticosteroid therapy, a seroconversion of 95.8% occurred on day 21 after onset of illness. [35] This differs from the US experience where of the 74 probable cases of SARS reported by 15 July 2003, only 8 had been confirmed by laboratory diagnosis (all by serology); 38 were negative and 28 had no result. b Antibody testing should also be carried out on a serum sample collected >28 days after symptom onset. antibody titer when tested in parallel should be considered indicative of a confirmed case. A variety of methods for detection of coronavirus infection are now available. These include culture methods, PCR-based methods, and serological tests. [31] Culture of the SARS coronavirus is considered solid evidence of infection, but there have been problems with the various generations of RT-PCR assays, both with false-positive results and with inconsistent detection of viral genome in the first days of illness as well as later in the convalescent phase. It is therefore recommended that detection of SARS-CoV RNA by RT-PCR be validated by a second reference laboratory. [32] Because antibodies to SARS coronavirus have not been found in the general population, background SARS coronavirus antibodies do not appear to be a substantial concern. However, the current serologic assays (both ELISA and IFA [indirect fluorescent antibody] formats) do not reliably detect antibodies until the titers rise substantially after the second week of illness. According to the USCDC, suspect or probable cases are considered laboratory-confirmed if SARS coronavirus is isolated, if antibody to SARS coronavirus is detected and confirmed by a second reference laboratory, or if two Table IV .

[1] In one preliminary, uncontrolled study by Loutfy et al. [38] from Toronto, use of interferon 9 \u03bcg/day for a minimum of 2 days and increased to 15 \u03bcg/day for a total of 10 days, plus corticosteroids (oral prednisone 50mg twice a day, or intravenous methylprednisolone 40mg every 12 hours) was associated with reduced disease-associated impaired oxygen saturation and more rapid resolution of radiographic lung abnormalities. The authors acknowledge, however, that these findings need to be interpreted cautiously in view of lack of randomization, the retrospective dosing, and the limited sample size (a total of 21 patients).

Treatment for limiting the impact of SARS is implementation of preventive At the time of writing (24 May 2004), no specific therapy is recommended. A variety of treatments have been attempted, but there are no controlled data. Most patients have been treated throughout the illness with broad-spectrum antimicrobials, supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluids, and other supportive measures.\n\nSome clinicians have advocated a combination of ribavirin and corticosteroids, but the efficacy of these drugs has not been established. The use of systemic corticosteroids in SARS is controversial, and the efficacy based on controlled studies is unavailable. [36] One study found initial use of pulse-dosed methyl prednisolone (\u2265500 mg/day) to be more efficacious and equally well tolerated as a lower dose of methyl prednisolone, but this was based on retrospective observational evaluation. [35] The use of corticosteroids in patients with viral infections can be hazardous when not accompanied by an effective anti-viral agent. [36] Early testing of ribavirin and other antiviral compounds against the novel coronavirus have not produced evidence of in vitro activity. [31] An evaluation of the use of ribavirin was published by Knowles et al., [37] who reported adverse events in 110 patients with suspected or probable SARS treated with ribavirin. Of those 110 patients 61% had evidence of hemolytic anemia; hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia were detected in 58% and 46% of patients, respectively. [33] The authors felt the benefits of ribavirin may not outweigh the risk of adverse events. There was a potential for ribavirin to have negative clinical and economic consequences because of the adverse events. It is now considered among the Table VI . Recommendations for the evaluation of patients with communityacquired respiratory illness in the presence or absence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) transmission in the world [34] In the absence of SARS-CoV transmission anywhere in the world, the diagnosis of SARS-CoV disease should be considered only in patients who require hospitalization for radiographically confirmed pneumonia and who have an epidemiologic history that raises the suspicion of SARS-CoV disease.\n\nIn the absence of SARS-CoV transmission anywhere in the world, suspicion of SARS infection is raised if, within 10 days of symptom onset: the patient had a history of recent travel to mainland China, Hong Kong, or Taiwan; was in close contact with ill people with a history of recent travel to such areas; is employed in an occupation at particular risk for SARS-CoV exposure, including a healthcare worker with direct contact or a worker in a laboratory that contains live SARS-CoV; or is part of a cluster of cases of atypical pneumonia without an alternative diagnosis Once SARS-CoV transmission has been documented in the world, a diagnosis of SARS should still be considered in patients who require hospitalization for pneumonia and who have an epidemiologic history described above. In addition, all patients with fever or respiratory symptoms should be questioned about whether within 10 days of symptom onset they have had: close contact with someone suspected of having SARS-CoV disease; a history of foreign travel (or close contact with an ill person with a history of travel) to a location with documented or suspected SARS-CoV infection; exposure to a domestic location with documented suspected SARS-CoV (including a laboratory that contains live SARS-CoV); or close contact with an ill person with such an exposure history Fig. 4 .

The early symptoms of SARS-CoV disease usually include fever, chills, rigors, myalgia, and headache. Respiratory symptoms often do not appear until 2-7 days after the onset of illness. 2 In settings with more extensive transmission, all patients with fever or respiratory symptoms should be evaluated for possible SARS-CoV disease. 3 Depending on symptoms and exposure history, initial diagnostic testing for patients may include complete blood count, chest x-ray (CXR), pulse oximetry, blood cultures, sputum Gram stain and culture, testing for viral respiratory pathogens (notably influenza and respiratory syncytial virus), Legionella sp. and pneumococcal urinary antigen. 4 An alternative diagnosis should be based on laboratory tests with high-predictive value (e.g. blood culture, urinary antigen). 5 Chest computed tomography (CT) may show evidence of an inflitrate before a CXR. Therefore, a chest CT should be considered in patients with a strong epidemiologic link to a known case of SARS and a negative CXR 6 days after onset of symptoms. 6 SARS isolation precautions should be discontinued after consultation with local public health authorities and the evaluating physician.\n\nAn important characteristic of the recent SARS outbreaks has been infection transmission.
