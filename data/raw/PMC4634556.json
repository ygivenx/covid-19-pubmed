{"title": "Model answers or trivial pursuits? The role of mathematical models in influenza pandemic preparedness planning", "body": "The pandemic of 1918\u20131919 was characterized by high attack rates, several waves of infection and high mortality in young adults. Such observations can be better understood by fitting explanatory models to the data to estimate R\n0 and other parameters governing influenza spread.\n9\n, \n10\n These parameter estimates can then be used to simulate model scenarios to examine the possible consequences of proposed outbreak control strategies.\n11\n\n\n\nIn an outbreak in a fully susceptible population, the average number of secondary cases infected by a primary case is denoted by the reproduction number, R\n0, which depends on the duration of the infectious period (1/\u03b3), and a transmission parameter (\u03b2), influenced by viral and host factors and contact opportunities. In its simplest form: \nR\n0 can be estimated from the final attack rate if the population was fully susceptible at the outset. However, in many situations, populations have pre\u2010existing immunity, and a proportion of exposures leads to subclinical infections, reducing the apparent attack rate. The proportion immune (\u03c9) within a particular population determines the effective reproductive number (R) by the relationship: \nR\n0 provides a worst\u2010case scenario for the attack rate. Furthermore, in combination with the mean generation time (serial interval between cases) and the proportion susceptible, R\n0 determines the rate of spread of an outbreak. In favourable circumstances, R\n0 can be estimated from outbreak data, with parallel inferences about levels of subclinical infection and prior immunity.\n\nThis article reviews aspects of influenza biology and epidemiological findings from past influenza epidemics. It provides insight into the nature of influenza infection in individuals, and the dissemination of virus in households, schools and populations. We highlight the importance of susceptibility, pre\u2010existing immunity and subclinical infection in modifying the apparent attack rate and spread of influenza, and suggest that mathematical models of influenza transmission would be improved if they could account more adequately for such factors. Finally, we review the potential utility of interventions such as social distancing, antivirals and immunization to prevent or limit outbreaks.\n\nSome hosts are more susceptible to influenza because they have little or no acquired immunity or because of intrinsic factors affecting innate immunity.\n12\n, \n17\n Isolated populations with no recent influenza exposure are particularly vulnerable, as with Native Americans and Pacific Islanders during the 1918\u20131919 pandemic.\n18\n, \n19\n Likewise, on Tristan da Cunha, where influenza had been absent for many years, the first arrival of H3N2 virus by ship from Cape Town in 1970 led to 96% of persons falling ill, with repeat attacks in a significant minority.\n20\n\n\n\nConsistent with the premise of short\u2010lived protection through past exposures to inter\u2010pandemic influenza, much lower attack rates were reported in urbanized populations during the 1918\u20131919, 1957 and 1968 influenza pandemics. In Cleveland in 1957, 47% of household members had serologically confirmed influenza during a 10\u2010week period. Disease incidence in children aged 10\u201314 years was three times that in adults, in keeping with their relative naivety to influenza.\n21\n, \n22\n In contrast, more uniform attack rates were observed up to 50 years of age in the 1968 H3N2 pandemic, with relative sparing of people born before 1918 suggesting that exposure to related viral antigens more than 50 years earlier had conferred lasting protection.\n23\n, \n24\n, \n25\n, \n26\n\n\n\nIn the Houston family study of 1976, high titres of subtype\u2010specific haemagglutination\u2010inhibiting (HI) antibody titres protected against H3N2 influenza. Breakthrough infections did occur in those with high titres, but were usually milder.\n27\n In the Seattle cohort study from 1975 to 1979, HI antibody thresholds conferring protection differed for the three strains circulating over the period: A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and B.\n28\n, \n29\n Such variation is likely due to differences in the immunogenicity of HA antigens.\n30\n Further, attack rates in Seattle children were double those seen in adults for a given HI titre,\n29\n suggesting the importance of unmeasured humoral and cellular immunity.\n22\n, \n31\n, \n32\n Broadly reactive \u2018recall\u2019 immune responses, seen within days of vaccination,\n33\n could explain the rarity of H1N1 infection in Seattle adults with low HI titres and a cohort history of exposure to a related strain 26 years earlier.\n28\n\n\n\nSpicer and Lawrence modelled influenza in Greater London from 30 years of mortality data. Exposure to successive drift mutants was assumed to reduce the susceptible pool, which was replenished by births and the emergence of antigenically novel strains.\n34\n In a model for South\u2010East Asia, Ferguson et al. assumed that 27% of rural households would be resistant to a novel strain of influenza as a result of recent contact with related antigens.\n10\n Other models allow the risk of transmission,\n11\n, \n35\n or progression to disease given acquisition,\n36\n, \n37\n to depend on age, indirectly incorporating immune protection. Longini et al. explicitly calculated the influence of \u2018high\u2019 or \u2018low\u2019 antibody titres on influenza risk in children and adults from epidemic data, but could not refine their estimates.\n38\n\n\n\nThe simplest influenza models assume that a single episode of infection confers lifelong immunity. This cannot be true, especially for children, who can experience three or four clinical episodes in successive seasons.\n28\n Ferguson et al. modelled the combined effects of waning immunity and antigenic drift for inter\u2010pandemic virus by assuming that a single exposure to influenza protected against related strains for 5 years, after which individuals were again fully susceptible. Less robust immune responses in the very young and elderly were modelled by shortening this duration of protection.\n37\n\n\n\nIn the absence of priming, immune responses to novel antigens can be insufficient to confer short\u2010term protection, even in adults. This could explain the second wave of infections observed on Tristan da Cunha, in which 33% of islanders experienced a second (usually milder) attack within a month of the initial outbreak.\n20\n Repeat infections after a short interval have been reported in other outbreaks, as in the naval apprentice school at Greenwich in 1924 (Figure 1)\n39\n and the summer, autumn and winter waves of the 1918\u20131919 pandemic in England.\n19\n\n\n\nMultiple\u2010wave data from Tristan da Cunha and from the 1918\u20131919 pandemic in Royal Air Force camps in the UK (Figure 2) have been modelled to estimate R\n0 as well as parameters for prior immunity, waning of immunity/antigenic drift, and subclinical infection, with consistent results (J. Mathews, personal communication).\n\nAfter experimental inoculation of adults with influenza, virus titres in nasal lavage fluid rise at 24 hours, peak with fever onset at 48 hours, and then decline over the next 5 days.\n40\n, \n41\n In children with natural infections, viral titres continue to rise 24\u201348 hours after symptom onset.\n42\n In one community\u2010based study, 8\u00b73% of children were still shedding influenza virus into the second week of illness.\n43\n Elderly and immunocompromised patients can shed virus for weeks or even months.\n44\n Conversely, of cases detected by seroconversion during epidemic influenza seasons, perhaps a third are asymptomatic\n29\n, \n45\n and of uncertain infectious potential.\n\nViral shedding is an imperfect guide to the risk of transmission. During influenza outbreaks, some infected individuals never infect anyone else, whereas in exceptional circumstances as many as 40 secondary cases have been reported.\n46\n\nR\n0 thus represents a value averaged over different hosts and environments.\n47\n Experimental studies of influenza acquisition in humans\n48\n and animals\n49\n cannot capture subtle effects such as confinement on aeroplanes,\n46\n seasonal climatic variation\n50\n or altered conditions during wars.\n51\n\n\n\nEpidemiological and household studies can provide insights into host factors influencing infectiousness. Pre\u2010school and school age children are more likely than other infected household members to produce secondary cases among contacts,\n52\n a phenomenon attributed to density rather than to the duration of shedding in modelling analyses.\n53\n Accordingly, influenza models incorporating age structure\n36\n, \n54\n do not explicitly allow for longer infectious periods in children. Although asymptomatic individuals are unlikely to be highly infectious, serological evidence of \u2018off season\u2019 transmission in families has been reported.\n29\n Models that allow for reduced infectiousness of asymptomatic cases have halved the infectious period\n55\n or lowered the probability of transmission.\n10\n, \n56\n Whether or not \u2018severe\u2019 cases shed more virus and are thus more infectious is questionable, as the host immune response plays a significant role in pathogenicity.\n16\n, \n57\n, \n58\n\n\n\nViral shedding studies suggest that transmission could peak soon after the onset of illness in the index case. Ferguson et al.\n\n37\n and Fraser et al.\n\n59\n estimated that 30\u201350% of transmission occurred before symptom onset, assuming that illness would result in withdrawal to home. Some models incorporating household structure extend this idea, allowing continued exposure of the index case to family members while reducing community spread.\n36\n, \n56\n This assumption has significant consequences for outbreak control, which will be more difficult if most transmission occurs before index cases can be identified.\n59\n\n\n\nObservational studies of primary and secondary infections in households provide information about serial interval between cases. A mode of 2 days between the onset of symptoms in successively infected household members was reported by medical officers during pandemics in 1890\n7\n and 1918\u20131919.\n19\n The mean serial interval for Kelley's Island households in 1920 was 2\u00b79 days, with a mode of 2 days (Figure 3).\n60\n\n\n\nLater household studies during the 1957 pandemic in Cleveland and the 1968 pandemic in Kansas reported median serial intervals of 3\n61\n and 8 days\n23\n respectively. However, a mode of 2 days was again seen in Kansas,\n23\n and in subsequent studies of interpandemic influenza,\n52\n showing that the median is sensitive to censoring of the observation period. The average serial interval between cases could be longer for transmissions occurring in the community, if there is continuing access to susceptibles.\n\nElveback et al.\n\n36\n and Longini et al.\n\n35\n, \n56\n, \n62\n separate latent (1\u00b79 days) and infectious (4\u00b71 days) phases of influenza infection, with no transmission during the latent period.\n56\n Ferguson et al. allow for a similar mean latent phase of 1\u00b748 days in their individual\u2010based models, but shorten the duration of peak infectiousness to give a serial interval of 2\u00b76 days.\n10\n, \n11\n More recent work from the Longini group assumed a slightly longer generation time of 3\u00b75 days.\n63\n\n\n\nOpportunities for disease transmission differ by social situation, and location, as seen in the Kelley's island outbreak of 1920 (Figure 4).\n60\n\n\n\nHope\u2010Simpson estimated a fourfold increase in influenza incidence among general practice patients exposed to a household case.\n24\n Children typically experience higher age\u2010specific seasonal influenza attack rates than adults, often acquiring the infection from peers in day care centres, kindergartens and day schools.\n25\n For this reason they more frequently introduce illness into the family,\n27\n, \n29\n although in some previous pandemics an adult was as likely to be the household index case as was a child.\n23\n, \n64\n Family size and measures of crowding can further influence influenza risk.\n27\n, \n60\n, \n64\n Other residential settings in which large populations of susceptibles may become rapidly infected include boarding schools\n19\n, \n65\n and aged care homes.\n66\n, \n67\n\n\n\nIndirect evidence about the role of social mixing in disease transmission is provided by the natural history of the 1919 influenza pandemic in Sydney. Following diagnosis of the first cases in late January, government acted to limit spread by closing institutions and meeting places and by requiring masks to be worn in public. Incident cases declined by mid\u2010February, and restrictions were then removed. A second epidemic wave followed in early March, after which regulations were reimposed.\n68\n Records from 1919 also reveal higher infection rates in occupations involving travel and frequent contact with the public.\n68\n\n\n\nCompartmental models often stratify individuals by age to help capture the heterogeneity of contact opportunities in populations.\n69\n Ferguson et al. employ this method to characterize close mixing in schools and aged care institutions.\n37\n Longini et al. developed an individual\u2010based model of a \u2018typical\u2019 American population\n36\n with 1000\u20132000 people in households of different sizes and age structures, with some attending day care centres and schools.\n62\n The probability of acquiring infections from the community has been estimated from epidemiological data,\n70\n with parameters refined to incorporate the influence of age\n54\n and prior immunity.\n38\n Analogous models for influenza spread in rural South\u2010East Asia\n10\n, \n35\n and the developed world\n11\n, \n63\n have characterized community mixing patterns in a range of social settings.\n35\n Network type models consider explicit interactions between discrete nodes, with contact probabilities related to social rather than geographical distance.\n71\n, \n72\n Other models have simulated spread within and between subpopulations to estimate the probability of local extinction of an outbreak, and subsequent reintroduction.\n73\n, \n74\n Incorporation of geographical distance and travel information has allowed modelling of the effects of travel on regional,\n75\n national\n76\n and international\n76\n influenza spread.\n\nSocial distancing encompasses measures that limit person\u2010to\u2010person spread of infection. In the 1918\u20131919 pandemic, stringent quarantine of the island populations of American Samoa and Australia was of benefit,\n18\n, \n19\n although unlikely to be practicable in our age of international air travel.\n11\n, \n77\n Restrictions on social movement within communities in 1919 also appeared to limit disease spread.\n68\n A caveat is that self\u2010imposed behavioural changes can influence the apparent efficacy of government interventions during any pandemic.\n10\n, \n63\n\n\n\nThe effects of school closures on community\u2010wide influenza transmission are not well defined. During the 1920 influenza epidemic on Kelley's island, Ohio, school contacts were found to be important in disease spread. Further, a decline in incidence followed school closure (Figure 5).\n60\n\n\n\nMore recently, a 30% reduction in paediatric visits to healthcare providers coincided with a 2\u2010week teachers\u2019 strike during the epidemic influenza season in Israel.\n78\n Historically, the likely benefit of closing schools was thought to depend on the household living conditions to which children would be returned.\n19\n Accordingly, models exploring this intervention are sensitive to assumptions about age\u2010specific transmission rates in the school compared with rates in the home.\n11\n, \n63\n\n\n\nTransmission from infected individuals can be reduced by institutional or household quarantine. Household\u2010based models of this strategy show a fall in effective reproduction rate, contingent upon the timeliness of tracing, the proportion of cases and contacts identified and their compliance.\n11\n, \n79\n Infection control measures, including hand hygiene and personal protective equipment, can also reduce the individual risk of respiratory infections.\n80\n, \n81\n Although aerosol spread of influenza can occur,\n46\n its importance, relative to droplet infection, is still controversial, with implications for the standard of protective mask needed to reduce exposure risk.\n82\n, \n83\n Importantly, experience of the recent SARS outbreak has shown that well co\u2010ordinated institutional responses can protect healthcare workers far more than would be predicted from the additive effects of individual measures.\n81\n\n\n\nThe neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) zanamivir and oseltamivir antagonize the action of neuraminidase (NA), thereby impairing release of virions from host cells.\n84\n Although effective in prophylaxis and in reducing the severity and duration of symptoms in interpandemic influenza, the use of these drugs has produced little benefit in H5N1 influenza,\n85\n possibly because of treatment delay,\n85\n which reduces efficacy,\n86\n or higher viral loads.\n87\n\n\n\nData from clinical trials with interpandemic influenza show that NAI treatment within 48 hours of symptom onset in virologically confirmed influenza reduces viral shedding by 40\u201370%.\n85\n Effects begin within 24 hours,\n88\n with total suppression of virus achievable by day 2\u20133 of illness.\n89\n NAIs have less impact on shedding in children,\n90\n but a 1\u2010day reduction in symptom duration is achievable regardless of age.\n91\n, \n92\n Prophylaxis with NAIs can reduce the risk of infection in household contacts, measured by seroconversion or viral isolation, over and above treatment of the index case,\n93\n with efficacy of 60\u201380%.\n85\n Breakthrough cases on prophylaxis are less symptomatic.\n93\n\n\n\nPublished models of scenarios using antivirals to limit the spread of pandemic influenza have used estimates of prophylactic efficacy based on such data.\n10\n, \n11\n, \n55\n, \n56\n, \n63\n The maximal achievable reduction in infectiousness as a result of treatment has been estimated at 28%.\n10\n Models allow exploration of a range of targeted scenarios for antiviral use, from treatment of cases and household contacts,\n11\n to prophylaxis of institutions or geographical regions where disease has been identified.\n10\n, \n35\n, \n63\n The importance of early case detection is paramount,\n11\n with the size of the antiviral stockpile as another major constraint. In the containment phase of a pandemic, an aggressive combined approach to treatment and prophylaxis of incident cases represents optimal use of a limited resource.\n94\n\n\n\nInfluenza virus resistance to oseltamivir is of potential concern,\n95\n but at present can be demonstrated in less than 0.5% of strains worldwide.\n96\n Mutants arising in vitro can have mutations in both HA and NA genes,\n97\n whereas those from treated immunocompetent patients show single mutations in the NA region.\n98\n Transmissibility of most resistant strains is greatly reduced,\n99\n but exceptions occur,\n49\n leaving no room for complacency.\n100\n Nine of fifty children treated with oseltamivir carried resistant strains within 4 days, with persistent shedding of both resistant and wild\u2010type virus to day 7,\n97\n possibly related to the high viral loads observed in childhood.\n101\n The rarity of clinical zanamivir resistance\n102\n may relate to the poor in vitro viability of strains with this mutation.\n103\n\n\n\nModels exploring the population impact of antiviral resistance confirm that the transmissibility of resistant strains, relative to wild type, and the rate of emergence of such strains are most important as determinants of outcome.\n37\n Intriguingly, a high rate of production of poorly transmissible mutants could aid, rather than hinder, outbreak control (J. McCaw, personal communication). Models comparing the likely impact of treatment or prophylaxis on the emergence of drug resistance are critically dependent on underlying assumptions. If as much as half of all transmission occurs before case detection, prophylaxis\u2010based strategies favour selection of mutant strains,\n37\n whereas if transmission continues for several days after case detection, treatment has a greater impact on resistance profile.\n55\n\n\n\nA potential concern is that antiviral agents could blunt the immune response to influenza, leaving treated cases susceptible.\n85\n, \n104\n Recurrent influenza infection has been reported in one small paediatric case series,\n105\n but there is no consistent evidence from adult studies to give cause for wider concern.\n106\n, \n107\n Re\u2010infection has also been observed in untreated children, possibly because of immunological naivety or immaturity.\n108\n Furthermore, adult clinical trials of antiviral agents consistently show that virologically confirmed cases are prevented more effectively than serologically confirmed cases,\n89\n, \n106\n, \n109\n indicating sufficient exposure for seroconversion without illness.\n\nInactivated split virion vaccines based on recent H5N1 isolates from humans are currently under phase I trial. As H5 is novel to humans, high concentrations of antigen,\n110\n, \n111\n incorporation of adjuvants\n112\n and booster doses\n110\n, \n111\n, \n112\n have been necessary to achieve immunogenicity. Some monovalent vaccines against novel HA antigens have maximized yield by using reactogenic whole virus formulations.\n113\n, \n114\n Candidate H5 vaccines have afforded protection in neutralization assays\n115\n and animal models against variant H5 viruses.\n116\n, \n117\n Such \u2018best guess\u2019 vaccines can be stockpiled for possible use in priming critical subpopulations such as front line healthcare workers.\n115\n Nevertheless, if a pandemic occurs there will likely be substantial delays in production and supply shortages of strain\u2010specific vaccines due to limited global manufacturing capacity.\n118\n\n\n\nThere is uncertainty about the best correlates of protection for interpandemic influenza vaccines,\n119\n let alone for a novel strain. Early observations showed that high titre (1:30\u20131:40) HI antibody is predictive of clinical protection,\n17\n, \n120\n, \n121\n although this measure is subject to considerable inter\u2010laboratory variation.\n122\n For licensure in the EU, The Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) requires documentation of HI antibody responses in terms of: post vaccine seroprotection rate (HI titre \u22651:40), mean fold increase and response, and seroconversion rate.\n123\n Interpretation is complicated, as fold rises will be smaller for individuals with pre\u2010existing immunity, although protection will often be improved.\n124\n Reduced protection against heterologous influenza strains has been shown in challenge studies,\n125\n, \n126\n which could explain why some immunogenic vaccines perform poorly in the field.\n127\n Heterosubtypic vaccines providing broad protection against different sub\u2010types offer theoretical advantages, but their efficacy is yet to be demonstrated.\n128\n\n\n\nAn efficient use of pandemic influenza vaccines would be to control transmission through herd immunity. Immunization of pre\u2010school children in day care is known to significantly protect their families.\n129\n A more modest reduction in respiratory infections is seen among parents of vaccinated school age children,\n130\n and in teachers and classmates where institutional coverage is high.\n131\n In Tecumseh, Michigan, vaccination of schoolchildren prior to the influenza season in 1968\u20131969 prevented an epidemic similar to that in the comparison city of Adrian.\n132\n More dramatically, when mandatory influenza vaccination of Japanese schoolchildren was stopped in 1994 there was a sharp increase in pneumonia and influenza mortality in the elderly.\n133\n Likewise, immunization of carers in aged care institutions predicts a reduction in all\u2010cause mortality among elderly residents in the UK\n66\n, \n134\n and Japan.\n67\n\n\n\nIn the simplest models, immunization moves all vaccinated susceptibles to the removed/recovered class.\n72\n However, vaccination is more likely to provide incomplete protection for most of those immunized. This critical distinction determines not only the threshold size of an epidemic,\n135\n but the optimal vaccine coverage required for disease control.\n136\n Vaccine effects can be characterized further within subgroups of interest identified from clinical trials.\n137\n In addition, the time to maximal immune response can be a critical consideration in outbreak settings.\n36\n As most models assume that vaccination reduces both acquisition rate in those exposed, and viral shedding in established cases, it follows that vaccines will be useful even when efficacy is partial.\n35\n, \n37\n, \n63\n, \n138\n\n\n\nSeveral models have explored the theoretical effectiveness of targeted immunization for pandemic control, showing optimal benefit from vaccinating children of school\n63\n, \n138\n and preschool age.\n137\n Britton and Becker concluded that influenza could be controlled most efficiently by targeting immunization to families with three or more members.\n139\n Such model conclusions depend upon underlying assumptions about population susceptibility and transmission in heterogeneous circumstances. For example, using assumptions based on age\u2010specific attack profiles from the 1957 and 1968 pandemics, Patel et al. obtained two very different estimates for the optimal proportional distribution by age group of a limited number of vaccine doses.\n140\n\n\n\nHistorical and contemporary data show that the transmissibility and pathogenicity of influenza viruses depend on complex interactions with host populations. The emergence of H5N1 as a threat to the poultry industry has undoubtedly been influenced by a very rapid increase in numbers of caged birds in developing countries. Likewise, the risk of a new human pandemic can be linked to both the emergence of avian influenza, and to the large numbers of people on the planet, any one of whom could be host to viruses undergoing a pandemic mutation or recombination event.\n\nHost immunity, which plays a crucial role, has clear specificity for influenza sub\u2010type and strain. However, cross\u2010reactive immune responses are needed to explain some otherwise anomalous observations.\n21\n, \n22\n In particular, there is reason to believe that clinical attack rates for influenza are not often constrained by low values for R\n0, but rather by pre\u2010existing immunity, and by subclinical infections which can immunize without causing symptoms.\n\nWith such complex interactions, making precise predictions about age\u2010specific attack rates, morbidity and mortality due to a novel pandemic strain is near impossible. Nevertheless, mathematical models do provide a useful framework for pandemic scenarios to explore the potential benefit of public health interventions. As all models have to oversimplify complex biological systems, they should be interpreted with great caution. In particular, models are exquisitely sensitive to underlying assumptions about susceptibility, subpopulations and modes of transmission \u2013 all of which must be inferred, rather than being quantified by direct observation.\n\nModel assumptions and predictions should be tested against as many real\u2010world observations as possible to test the sensitivity of the model to different contexts. By validating model outputs against multiple data sources, investigators can tease out which of the parameters determining disease spread are more likely to vary between contexts, and which are relatively constant. To encourage such work, and to make relevant data sets more easily accessible, we have developed an on\u2010line publicly searchable archive (FluWeb: http://influenza.sph.unimelb.edu.au), which includes rare historical documents from the 1889\u20131891 and 1918\u20131919 pandemics giving individual and group level data on influenza morbidity and mortality. By maximizing our use of historical evidence, we hope to more confidently predict the future.\n\nJ.D.M. is an active member of the National Influenza Pandemic Advisory Committee (NIPAC).
