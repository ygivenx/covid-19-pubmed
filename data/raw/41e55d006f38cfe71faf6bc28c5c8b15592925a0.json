{"title": "Lessons from the field Developing pandemic preparedness in Europe in the 21st century: experience, evolution and next steps", "body": "Although pandemics have occurred at irregular intervals throughout history, pandemic preparedness plans only appeared in Europe in the 1990s. 1,2 Following preliminary guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) in pandemic planning (1999) , the 2003 World Health Assembly adopted a resolution that called for the development of national and global pandemic preparedness plans and that set the first targets for seasonal influenza immunization coverage. 2, 3 The global disruption caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 fuelled the adoption in 2005 of the first comprehensive International Health Regulations. That same year WHO published its first global guidance and checklist for pandemic planning. 2, 4 In 2001, the European Union (EU) and its Member States held the first European pandemic planning workshop drawing on European legislation for health security. 2 The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) commenced operations in May 2005 and made pandemic preparedness its first disease-specific priority. The ECDC worked with WHO's Regional Office for Europe in supporting Member States of the EU and the European Commission (EC) in strengthening pandemic preparedness in EU and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries, while the WHO's Regional Office also worked with other countries in WHO's European region.\n\nThis paper reports on the work of the ECDC, the EC and WHO's Regional Office in supporting the assessment, development and strengthening of pandemic planning and preparedness in WHO's European Region in [2005] [2006] [2007] [2008] [2009] . It explains the initial problems encountered, the changes made to the assessment procedure with experience, the lessons learnt from the 2009 pandemic, and those aspects of pandemic preparedness that should be improved. In a short paper the detail is limited, but more information is available through a timeline and in pandemic preparedness web pages. 2, [5] [6] [7] Initial procedure During 2005 During -2009 , national pandemic preparedness was assessed in 43 European countries, including all countries belonging to the EU. Central to this was a standardized procedure to assist countries in assessing and improving their national and local pandemic preparedness plans based on WHO's 2005 checklist, whose indicators of preparedness were used. 4 These activities intensified when human cases of influenza A(H5N1) \"bird flu\" appeared in Azerbaijan and Turkey along with sporadic infection in wild and domestic birds in most other European countries. 2 The assessments, which began in the summer of 2005, were conducted by external teams of pandemic preparedness experts from the ECDC, the EC and WHO's Regional Office Problem Improving pandemic planning and preparedness is a challenge in Europe, a diverse region whose regional bodies (the Regional Office for Europe of the World Health Organization [WHO], the European Commission and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) have overlapping roles and responsibilities. Approach European pandemic preparedness indicators were used to develop an assessment tool and procedure based on the 2005 global WHO checklist for pandemic preparedness. These were then applied to Member States of WHO's European Region, initially as part of structured national assessments conducted during short visits by external teams. Local setting Countries in WHO's European Region. Relevant changes From 2005 to 2008, 43 countries underwent a pandemic preparedness assessment that included a short external assessment visit by an expert team. These short visits developed into a longer self-assessment procedure involving an external team but \"owned\" by the countries, which identified gaps and developed plans for improving preparedness. The assessment tool and procedure became more sophisticated as national and local pandemic preparedness became more complex. The 2009 pandemic revealed new gaps in planning, surveillance communications and immunization. Lessons learnt Structured national self-assessments with support from external teams allow individual countries to identify gaps in their pandemic preparedness plans and enable regional bodies to assess the regional and global resources that such plans require. The 2009 pandemic revealed additional problems with surveillance, pandemic severity estimates, the flexibility of the response, vaccination, involvement of health-care workers and communication. European national plans are being upgraded and global leadership is required to ensure that these plans are uniformly applied across the region.\n\nLessons from the field European pandemic preparedness in the 21st century Angus Nicoll et al.\n\nfor Europe. During brief visits to each country, these teams worked with health ministry officials and technical agencies in completing a standard questionnaire based on WHO's checklist of preparedness indicators. They subsequently sent a written report to each country. 2\n\nAs country visits took place, the limitations of the external assessment model became clear. Over time a self-assessment tool and procedure 2,6,8 based on improved indicators were developed. The indicators were specifically designed for the pandemic planning process and reflected the increasing complexity of national and local pandemic preparedness. This revised assessment procedure covered new issues, such as local preparedness; intersectoral work (i.e. work beyond the health sector); the consistency of policies across neighbouring countries (interoperability); vaccination against seasonal influenza; laboratory preparedness; antiviral treatment and vaccination strategies; pandemic simulation exercises; and communication between agencies and with the public, professionals and neighbouring countries. Some national authorities had stopped preparations after producing written plans and had not developed the operational aspects or determined if they would work in practice. Hence, the concept of three essential \"Ps\"planning, preparedness and practice -was adopted, and the concept that published national plans were essential but not sufficient was emphasized. Local tests to see how national policies would be developed at the front line (e.g. in distributing and delivering vaccines) were published so that countries could assess their capacity for delivering local countermeasures and services. 9 \n\nIn the EU/EEA area the initial assessment procedure was found lacking. The short external assessments could not cope with the complexity of pandemic preparedness and did not mobilize incountry activity sufficiently, especially outside the health sector. Hence, the procedure evolved into longer selfassessments \"owned\" and enacted by each country, with in-country leads and involvement of more national agencies. The short visit by an expert external team remained important, and over time these teams began to include national experts in pandemic preparedness from other European countries. At the end of each visit, a self-assessment report with recommendations was agreed upon with the national authority. Countries were encouraged to publish their selfassessments on national web sites and five countries did so: Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. 2 This led to delays in finalizing reports as countries negotiated internally for consensus and resources to enact recommendations, but it increased national impact, dissemination and country ownership of the findings. \n\nA sensitive question was whether national preparedness should be centrally monitored using the WHO indicators, which included items such as the existence or absence of an intersectoral plan or of local arrangements for delivering vaccines. Some countries preferred to withhold their specific results or to share them only with a technical agency (WHO or the ECDC) because in a recent publication national preparedness plans that had been posted on the internet were analysed by external researchers and countries were ranked in \"league tables\" without the countries' validation of the findings. 2, 13 As an acceptable compromise, the ECDC collected countryspecific results, as generated using the indicators for the 2006 and 2007 EU surveys, but did not publish or communicate them individually. Instead, normative data allowed countries to determine how they compared with others. However, since national authorities felt their preparedness could still be judged against the preparedness indicators, after further consultation a more refined new generation of indicators was agreed upon in late 2008 but was not ready for use before the 2009 pandemic. 14\n\nFour regional workshops were carried out by the EC, the ECDC and WHO from 2005 to 2007. 2 These were valuable for maintaining political and operational momentum, mobilizing resources and allowing countries to learn from each other. 2 Smaller sub-regional workshops on specific topics also contributed. One of them led to the establishment of an EU Communicators Network, and the ECDC organized a series of workshops on the topic of surveillance and studies during a pandemic and issued publications that were used during the pandemic in 2009. 2 Preparedness and planning -General weaknesses in core preparedness capacities -Assess core capacities by WHO and EU Member States as required by the IHR

evaluation and independent scientific investigation of these reports \n\nThe 2009 pandemic provided a sustained arena that tested European preparedness and generated many evaluations and lessons (Box 1). 16 WHO's Regional Office for Europe carried out an evaluation of how pandemic preparedness aided the response to the pandemic. 17 The EC undertook a detailed evaluation of the handling of vaccine-related activities, and the ECDC posted all evaluations on a single web site. 2, 16 Although overall the response to the pandemic was felt to be strong, many weaknesses were found at the country level (Table 1) . For instance, vaccine policies were inconsistent across the EU and vaccines arrived in different places at different times. 18 Some improvements are already being made (Table 1) ; they apply to in-hospital surveillance for severe influenza; vaccination against seasonal influenza; joint vaccine procurement; and seroepidemiological capacity. The overall goal is a more risk-based, flexible approach to seasonal and pandemic influenza preparedness (Table 1) . Finally, there is common recognition of the danger of simply preparing for a repeat of the 2009 pandemic experience, since all pandemics are different. In the autumn of 2011, the ECDC and WHO's Regional Office for Europe held four \"rolling\" workshops for all Member States in WHO's European Region that addressed the changes being made to national pandemic plans and preparedness in the aftermath of the 2009 pandemic. 2 Some countries were already at an advanced stage in the process of updating their pandemic plans in accordance with the lessons they had learnt in 2009. However, no standard pattern in content or timing was in place, and many countries were waiting for WHO to lead with its own plan revisions. Some countries had dissociated their activities from WHO's global pandemic phases. Many countries expressed the intention of moving towards making pandemic preparedness a part of general preparedness for a wider range of emergencies (Table 1 ). Without regional or global leadership in these domains, pandemic preparedness plans could diverge even further across Europe.\n\nLessons from the field \n\nSituaci\u00f3n La mejora de la planificaci\u00f3n y preparaci\u00f3n pand\u00e9mica es un reto en Europa, una regi\u00f3n diversa cuyos organismos regionales (la Oficina regional para Europa de la Organizaci\u00f3n Mundial de la Salud [OMS], la Comisi\u00f3n Europea y el Centro Europeo para la Prevenci\u00f3n y el Control de Enfermedades) tienen papeles y responsabilidades coincidentes. Enfoque Se utilizaron los indicadores europeos de preparaci\u00f3n pand\u00e9mica para desarrollar una herramienta y un procedimiento de evaluaci\u00f3n basados en la lista de comprobaci\u00f3n global 2005 de la OMS relativa a la preparaci\u00f3n pand\u00e9mica. \u00c9stos se aplicaron luego a los Estados miembros de la regi\u00f3n europea de la OMS, en un principio, como parte de las evaluaciones nacionales estructuradas realizadas durante breves visitas de equipos externos. Marco regional Pa\u00edses en la regi\u00f3n europea de la OMS. Cambios importantes De 2005 a 2008, 43 pa\u00edses se sometieron a una evaluaci\u00f3n de preparaci\u00f3n pand\u00e9mica que inclu\u00eda una breve visita de evaluaci\u00f3n externa de un equipo de expertos. Estas visitas se desarrollaron hasta convertirse en un procedimiento de autoevaluaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s largo, que inclu\u00eda a un equipo externo, pero de \"propiedad\" de los pa\u00edses, que identific\u00f3 lagunas y desarrollaron planes para mejorar la preparaci\u00f3n. La herramienta y el procedimiento de evaluaci\u00f3n incrementaron su sofisticaci\u00f3n a medida que la preparaci\u00f3n pand\u00e9mica nacional y local fue aumentando en complejidad. La pandemia sufrida en 2009 revel\u00f3 nuevas lagunas en la planificaci\u00f3n, las comunicaciones de vigilancia y la inmunizaci\u00f3n. Lecciones aprendidas Las autoevaluaciones nacionales estructuradas con la asistencia de equipos externos permitieron a cada pa\u00eds identificar lagunas en sus planes de preparaci\u00f3n pand\u00e9mica y permitieron a los organismos regionales evaluar los recursos regionales y globales que requieren dichos planes. La pandemia de 2009 revel\u00f3 problemas adicionales en la vigilancia, las estimaciones de gravedad pand\u00e9mica, la flexibilidad de la respuesta, la vacunaci\u00f3n, la implicaci\u00f3n de los trabajadores sanitarios y la comunicaci\u00f3n. Los planes nacionales europeos se est\u00e1n actualizando y es necesario un liderazgo global para asegurar que estos planes se aplican de manera uniforme en toda la regi\u00f3n."}
