This approach was used by the laboratories of Lai and of Makino to study MHV-JHM these closely related viruses may exist.

These DI RNAs were selected because they are replicated efficiently by the viral polymerase. An identical series of deletions was introduced into the 5-POL 1a part of both DIs. In this way a range of lengths of 5 sequence colinear with the genome from 3889 (MIDI) through 1990 (MIDIDH) to 466 nts (MIDIDBam/Pst) was generated which could be analyzed in the background of differently sized DI genomes. For MIDI, in all cases but one (the D2 mutant), the 5 sequences were fused to those starting at genomic nt position 2503. In the case of MIDIDH all fusions except D2 were with sequences starting at position 1984. The structure of the DIs and of the deletions made are depicted in Fig. 1 . Note that none of the MIDIDH RNAs contain the internal sequence (nts 3113-3248 on the genomic RNA) reported to be required in cis for MHV-JHM DI replication by MHV-A59 (Kim et al., 1993; Lin and Lai, 1993) .\n\nSince MHV-A59 DI RNAs, unlike most of those of MHV-JHM, need to contain long open reading frames to be of T7 RNA transcripts (data not shown). The replication of the deletion mutant RNAs was analyzed in transfected cells (P0) and after several passages (P1-4). P0 RNA dried and hybridized to oligonucleotide 048, which detects all viral RNAs, with c135, which binds to the 5 NTR, was studied for two reasons. First, it could not be excluded that the deletions made would affect packaging or with c061, which binds to the packaging signal (Van der Most et al., 1991; Fosmire et al., 1992) . The latter two or uncoating signals, in which case only the P0 data would directly reflect replication efficiency of the deletion oligonucleotides only detect DI and genomic RNA but give a background signal of ribosomal RNA (indicated mutants. Second, we have shown previously that DIs with reduced fitness will be out competed by recombi-by an asterisk in the figures). The T7-produced RNAs are not of one length as the transfected plasmids are not nants with higher fitness upon passaging (De Groot et al., 1992) . Most deletion mutants we generated can revert linearized and do not contain a T7 termination signal. However, the plasmids to include 20 nts of poly(A), which to the parental DI RNA by recombination with genomic RNA. We expected that P0 DI RNA replication would may cause the T7 polymerase to detach and could lead to the production of a population of RNAs of discrete probably be unaffected by competition with recombinant RNAs, but not DI RNA from further passages. We were length. To exclude that we would be detecting these RNAs in P0, instead of those produced by replication by interested in determining whether the mutant RNAs would have a reduced fitness because of the deletions, the MHV polymerase, a control experiment was carried out first. Plasmid pMIDI was transfected into L-cells in-whether the recombinant parental DI RNAs would eventually prevail, and how the accumulation of the latter fected with vTF7.3 in the presence or absence of helper virus MHV-A59.

Seven hours after MHV-infection RNA was isolated and Metabolic labeling of RNA in the presence or absence of MHV-A59 and after shutdown of T7 transcription by resolved on denaturing agarose gels. The gels were actinomycin D shows that this is not the case. The DI RNA MIDI was detected only when helper virus was present (Fig. 2, right) .\n\nWe then went on to test each deletion mutant in L cells infected with vTF7.3 and MHV-A59 and transfected with the appropriate plasmids. The results, in transfected cells (P0), for each of the deletion mutant RNAs separated on agarose gels and hybridized to the 5-NTR-specific oligonucleotide C135 (Table 1) Efficient replication was found for the two parental RNAs, although MIDIDH, containing 1984 nts of genomic 5 sequence, accumulated to lower levels than did MIDI. Figure 3 shows that MIDIDPst (1145 nts) and mutants D3 (983 nts) and D1, lacking an additional 177 nts from the 5 end, replicated efficiently, but to lower levels than the parental MIDI. The mutant MIDIDBam/Pst, which has the shortest 5 sequence (466 nts), clearly replicated poorly, but to detectable levels. From Fig. 4 it can be seen that the accumulation of the MIDIDH derivatives was lower, but it showed the same pattern as did the MIDI derivatives. These mutants contain at most 1984 nts from the 5 end of the genome. It thus follows that (Kim et al., 1993; Lin and Lai, 1993) , to replicate MHVcoding DI RNAs as indicated above the lanes were dried and hybridized to oligonucleotide C135. See also legend to Fig. 3. A59-derived DI RNAs. Strikingly, the D2 mutants were FIG. 5 . Replication efficiency of MIDI and its deletion mutants in passage 1 L cells. Intracellular RNA, isolated 7 hr p.i. from L cells infected with DI viruses harvested from transfected cells (Fig. 3) , as indicated above the lanes, was separated on agarose gels. These were dried and hybridized to oligonucleotide C135. See also legend to Fig. 3. undetectable for both MIDI and MIDIDH. These mutants the medium from the P1 cells three more times and analyzed the MIDI-derived RNAs of P2 and P4 (hybridized have the same extent of 5 sequence as does the DBam/ to oligo 048, which recognizes all viral RNAs) and the Pst mutant. MIDID2, instead of having its 5 sequences MIDIDH RNAs of P4 (hybridized to oligo C061, which fused to those from nt 2503 and on, as do all other MIDI binds to the packaging signal) as described above (Figs. deletion mutants, has additional sequences from nts 7 and 8). Those DI RNAs seen to replicate in P0 and P1 801 to 1144 discontinuously fused inbetween. It is thus a double deletion mutant. This is not the case with MIDIDHD2, which is a single deletion mutant, with the deletion between nts 467 and 801. Densitometric scans of the autoradiograms showed that the replication efficiency of the deletion mutants in both series decreased with decreased length of 5 sequences colinear with the genome (data not shown).\n\nNext, virus, containing DI virus, was harvested from transfected and infected cells at 7 hr p.i. and used to infect fresh L cells. RNA was again harvested at 7 hr p.i. (P1 RNA) and separated on agarose gels. The results of hybridization of dried gels to 5-NTR-specific oligonucleotide C135 are shown in Figs. 5 and 6.\n\nThe relative accumulation of P1 and P0 RNAs was essentially the same, showing that packaging and uncoating play no role in the replication of these RNAs. Again, the accumulation levels were lower when shorter stretches of 5 sequence were present on the DIs. The deletion mutants of MIDI accumulated to somewhat higher levels than did MIDI. No clear recombination re- ( Fig. 4) as indicated above the lanes. The gels were dried and hybridized to oligonucleotide C135. See also legend to Fig. 3. To examine the fitness of the DIs further, we passaged FIG. 7 . Replication efficiency of MIDI and its deletion mutants in passage 2 and 4 L cells. DI viruses were passaged two (P2) to four (P4) times on L cells and intracellular RNA was analyzed on agarose gels. Dried gels containing RNA as indicated above the lanes were hybridized to oligonucleotide 048, which binds to the 3 NTR. continued to do so, but always the recombinant parental ter of coronaviruses. In these viruses replicating DI RNAs RNA emerged, although to very different levels. As for naturally occur, which has opened the possibility of using the MIDI derivatives (Fig. 7) , the DBam/Pst and the D2 recombinant DNA techniques on infectious cDNA clones mutants clearly led to much higher levels of recombinant to study the cis-acting sequences involved in virus repli-MIDI than did the other deletion mutants.

Densitometric scans ous stretches of 5 sequence for replication by the MHVwere performed of the bands in P2 and P4 (data not A59 polymerase of MHV-A59-derived DIs. In contrast to shown). The intensity of the MIDI bands was unchanged the data reported by Kim et al. (1993) and Lin and Lai in the DPst lanes and progressively increased from the (1993) on replication signals of MHV-JHM DIs, an internal D1 through the D3 mutants to the DBam/Pst and D2 sequence domain (nts 3113-3248), which is present in deletion mutants, which showed an increase of four-to MHV-A59 at the same position, is not necessary for replisixfold. Interestingly, this pattern is the reverse of that of cation of MHV-A59-derived DIs by MHV-A59 helper virus. the accumulation of the deletion mutants in the P0 and Replication efficiencies of the DI deletion mutants P1 passages.\n\nwere reflected by the accumulation of the mutant DIs The MIDIDH mutants were only tested in a fourth pasthemselves in P0 and P1 intracellular RNA, but also by sage, but behaved in a manner similar to that of the MIDI the accumulation of recombinant parental RNAs in the mutants. The parental RNA MIDIDH was seen to appear lysates of further passages. In fact, the length of 5 sein all three lanes of the deletion mutants (Fig. 8) but the quences present on the deletion mutants was directly levels in the D1 and D3 mutant lanes were much lower correlated with replication efficiency in P0 and P1 and, than that in the D2 lane.

To date replication signals have only been studied for viruses of the MHV clus-the different deletion mutants. We have shown in earlier intact replication signals but with no full-length ORF. We are currently studying what underlying mechanism governs these different behaviors of DI RNAs. The shortest length of 5 sequences required for replication that could be mapped in our system was 466 nts. RNAs containing only these sequences at the 5 end replicated poorly. This length is in the same range as that reported by Kim et al. (1993) for MHV-JHM and Chang et al. (1994) for BCV. Masters et al. (1994) showed that a synthetic RNA consisting of the mRNA7 sequence of MHV-A59 in which the leader was replaced by the 5 467 nts of the genomic RNA could be replicated. It was only detected after cocultivation of transfected and MHV-A59-infected L cells and 17Cl1 cells, thus not directly in P0 as in our system. The synthetic DI used by Masters et al. is modeled after a naturally occurring bovine coronavirus DI RNA, reported by Chang et al. (1994) , which can be detected in transfected cells.\n\nWe have inserted the same range of deletions into the DISP RNA described earlier (Van der Most et al., 1995) . These deletion mutant RNAs replicate to much lower levels, but generally show the same pattern as the MIDI thus this constitutes the shortest length of 3 sequence required for replication we have mapped on MHV-A59 DIs. The shortest 3-replication signal on MHV-JHM RNA experiments that the length of the ORF may be a factor in determining the fitness of a DI RNA (Van der Most et was mapped by Lin and Lai (1993) to be 436 nts. Why is the replication efficiency of the deletion mutants al., 1995). However, this is not the case in these deletion mutants: the MIDIDBam/Pst mutant contains a longer correlated with the length of 5 sequence it contains and why are the D2 mutants undetectable? The observations ORF than MIDIDH, yet replicates less efficiently. Also, the replication efficiency of the deletion mutants with made with the latter provide an important clue about what factor may be involved. A fusion of the genomic nts the same 5-end sequence but different length ORF is comparable.\n\n1-467 to 801 and further was not allowed in these mutants. The deleted sequence inbetween is by itself not We expected recombination and the generation of competing parental DI RNAs to become evident from required for replication, since it is also lacking in the DBam/Pst mutant, which replicates. All other deletion passage 1 on, as we had seen in previous experiments. However, no parental DI RNA bands emerged in P1. The mutants contain fused sequences, yet none of these fusions were lethal. Thus, the lack of replication of the D2 poorly replicating DBam/Pst mutant was not rapidly overgrown by the repaired and efficiently replicating recombi-deletion mutant RNAs seems to be the result of this particular joining of sequences. The key role is appar-nant MIDI RNA. More strikingly, the D2 mutants, which did not replicate to detectable levels at all, were not ently played by the sequence domain between nts 468 and 800. It is not required for replication but is located repaired by recombination to the parental DI RNAs in P1. This is remarkable since out-frame mutants are rapidly in a region that is in some way involved in replication, since deletions in this region reduce replication effi-out competed by recombinant in-frame RNA: we have shown these to be already present in P0 and to prevail ciency. This interpretation leads us to speculate that coronavirus replication involves an RNA superstructure. If in P1 ( Van der Most et al., 1995) . Recombinants did start to appear in P2 but only in the cases of the DBam/Pst a secondary or tertiary structure of RNA plays some role in the replication cycle, reduction of the length of the and the D2 mutants did the recombinant parental DI clearly out compete the deletion mutants in P4. Appar-sequences available for interaction would reduce the efficiency of replication to levels undetectable by our meth-ently, the presence of an ORF on a DI RNA is a much stronger factor determining selection of recombination ods and ultimately would result in loss of replication.\n\nConceivably, in the D2 mutants a joining of sequences repair RNAs than is replication efficiency. In other words, a DI RNA containing a full-length ORF but with impaired is generated which disrupts the RNA superstructure such that replication is strongly impeded. We have analyzed replication signals is more fit than a DI RNA containing RNA folding in this region by computer and whether it reported by Masters et al. (1994) , who have reported MHV-A59 DIs that also lack the cis-acting internal do-is different for the different deletion mutants. A strong secondary structure is predicted, which comprises nts main.
