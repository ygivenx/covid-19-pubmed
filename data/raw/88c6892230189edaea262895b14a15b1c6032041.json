{"title": "Ethnoveterinary knowledge of farmers in bilingual regions of Switzerland - is there potential to extend veterinary options to reduce antimicrobial use?", "body": "Ethnoveterinary research is defined as \"systematic investigation and application of folk veterinary knowledge, theory and practice\" (McCorkle, 1986) . Therefore, it plays a major role in the conservation of traditional knowledge on medicinal plants, and in the exploration of alternative treatment options in veterinary medicine (Lans et al., 2007; Sch\u00e4ffer, 2010; Lans, 2016; Bullitta et al., 2018) . European ethnoveterinary research has been performed mainly in Mediterranean countries (Blanco et al., 1999; Uncini Manganelli et al., 2001; Viegi et al., 2003; Scherrer et al., 2005; Pieroni et al., 2004 Pieroni et al., , 2006 Bonet and Valles, 2007; Akerreta et al., 2010; Benitez et al., 2012; Mayer et al., 2014; Bullitta et al., 2018) , in the German speaking parts of the European Alps (Schmid et al., 2012; Disler et al., 2014; Bischoff et al., 2016; Vogl et al., 2016; Mayer et al., 2017; Stucki et al., 2019) , and some in eastern European countries (Mayer et al., 2014) , notably Romania (Bartha et al., 2015) . However, data from French speaking regions, such as western Switzerland, are lacking.\n\nUses of medicinal plants by farmers could differ not only by geographical territories but also between linguistic groups in a confined area. Such differences have been reported in human ethnomedicine (Menendez-Baceta et al., 2015) , but similar comparisons with regard to veterinary use do not exist. Even if (a) earlier studies, comparing ethnoveterinary data from different countries (Viegi and Ghedira, 2014; Bartha et al., 2015; Mayer et al., 2017) suggest that \"ethnoveterinary tradition may change with growing geographical distance\" (Mayer et al., 2017) and, (b) a within-country comparison of two geographically and linguistically separate regions in Switzerland (Mayer et al., 2017) , and a comparison of two populations within the same region of Romania (but without differentiating between different linguistic groups; Bartha et al., 2015) highlighted some differences in ethnoveterinary practises, a comparison of ethnoveterinary data of two linguistic populations within one region is still lacking.\n\nIn 2014 the WHO report on antimicrobial resistances (WHO, 2014) disclosed that resistance to antibiotics has meanwhile been detected in all parts of the world. There is evidence that farm animals act as a reservoir of resistance genes, and that transmission of such genes to humans could occur either via direct contact or via food consumption (WHO, 2004; Marshall and Levy, 2011) . In addition, pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria carrying antimicrobial resistance gene are spread into the environment via the excrements of farm animals (Woolhouse et al., 2015) .\n\nNonetheless, antimicrobials are still widely used to prevent or treat diseases in farm animals, but also for non-therapeutic purposes like growth promotion. On a global scale it is estimated that antimicrobials used in livestock production will increase by 67% from approximately 63\u2032000 tons per year in 2010 to 106\u2032000 tons by 2030 (Van Boeckel et al., 2015) . The major classes of antimicrobials used for humans are also used in livestock, including reserve antibiotics (Aarestrup et al., 2008) . In Europe the use of antimicrobials is highest with intensive livestock species such as pigs, poultry and young cattle (European Medicines Agency, 2014; Federal Food Savety and Veterinary Office, 2019), mainly for gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases (Bennett et al., 1999) . In adult cattle mastitis is one of the most prevalent diseases (Bradley, 2002) , and is oftentimes treated with antibiotics.\n\nIn Switzerland, the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO) reported the increase of microbiological resistance in zoonotic pathogens and in indicator bacteria (FSVO, 2019) . A National Strategy on Antibiotic Resistance (StAR) has been developed to control and combat the development of antimicrobial resistance (StAR, 2015) . However, even though the use of medicinal plants in prevention or first line treatment of mild cases (Ayrle et al., 2016a) could possibly lower the need for antibiotic treatments of farm animals, it is not mentioned in StAR.\n\nFor indications such as topical treatment of skin afflictions, the number of available veterinary medicinal products in Switzerland is small. Only 18 veterinary drugs are registered for the treatment of dermatological disorders in livestock. The majority are either disinfecting agents or topical antibiotics (CPT, 2019). For some animal species the available veterinary medicinal products are even more limited. Over 100 antimicrobial drugs for systemic use in cattle are commercialized, but only 9 for use in horses (CPT, 2019).\n\nThere is a need to widen the spectrum of veterinary medicinal products and other therapeutic and preventive options for specific veterinary indications, and to reduce the use of antibiotics. However, even though the interest of veterinarians in herbal medicine has been increasing over the past decade (Kupper et al., 2018) , there is still a lack of clinical veterinary research with medicinal plants (Ayrle et al., 2016a) . In vitro and in vivo studies (Ayrle et al., 2016a) , historical veterinary literature (Stucki et al., 2019) and ethnoveterinary surveys can serve as knowledge base for the veterinary use of medicinal plants.\n\nWith a survey conducted in the bilingual regions of the Cantons Fribourg, Jura, Neuch\u00e2tel, and the French speaking part of Bern (administration of Bernese Jura) we wanted.\n\n(a) to publish the first ethnoveterinary data from French speaking areas of Europe, (b) to compare the ethnoveterinary knowledge of native French and German speakers in the survey area, and (c) to evaluate whether medicinal plants discussed in this survey could be an option to enlarge the therapeutic spectrum with a particular emphasis on antimicrobial therapies, skin disorders, and horses.\n\nThe study was conducted according to previous ethnoveterinary studies from Switzerland (Schmid et al., 2012; Disler et al., 2014; Bischoff et al., 2016; Mayer et al., 2017; Stucki et al., 2019) .\n\nThe survey was conducted in 3 western Swiss cantons, namely Fribourg, Neuch\u00e2tel, Jura, and in the French-speaking part of the canton of Bern, namely the administration of Bernese Jura (Fig. 1) . The total study area is located between 6\u00b03\u2032 and 7\u00b03\u2032 E and 46\u00b03\u2032 and 47\u00b03 N. The cantons Jura and Neuch\u00e2tel are bordered by France to the west, and the regions of previous Swiss ethnoveterinary studies (PSES, Fig. 1 ) to the east. The study covered an area of 3853.7 km 2 and a population of approx. 600\u2032000 persons. The majority of the population in the study area are native French speaking and, depending on the canton, up to one quarter are native German speaking persons (Bundesamt f\u00fcr Statistik, 2019). The altitude is between 373 and 2386m above sea level. Annual precipitation of the area varies from 947 mm to 1441 mm, and the average temperature at 647 m above sea level is 4.6\u00b0C (Bundesamt f\u00fcr Meteorologie und Klimatologie, 2019). The area had a total of 5431 farms, of which 4365 kept cattle and 1361 kept horses (Bundesamt f\u00fcr Statistik, 2013).\n\nDialog partners (DP) were recruited according to a previously described approach (Disler et al., 2014) . In a first step, the Departments of Agriculture of the cantons Fribourg, Jura and Neuch\u00e2tel supported the project by informing all farmers via bulletin or newsletters. Second, all organic farmers in the study area were informed via personal letter or email. Additionally, farmers were informed through publications in the regional agricultural press. All farmers of the research area who were known to be member of complementary medicine working groups, or member of the farm research network of the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) were contacted by telephone. Furthermore, the project was presented at two general assemblies of regional associations of organic farmers (Bio Jura, Bio Fribourg, Fig. 2) .\n\nA total of 62 dialog partners (DP) participated in the study: 26 DP (42%) in Fribourg, 15 (24%) in Jura, 11 (18%) in Bernese Jura, and 10 (16%) in Neuch\u00e2tel (Fig. 2 ). Thirty-one farmers spontaneously agreed (contacting the research team spontaneously based on the overall information via bulletin, newsletter, or individual letter or confirmed their participation during the telephone calls or personal meetings) to become a DP, while further 31 DP were recruited via snowball sampling (Bernhard, 2006; Disler et al., 2014, Fig. 2) . DP who had spontaneously agreed to participate were asked whether they knew of other farmers using medicinal plants for their livestock. Additional DP were recruited with the help of farmers or farm advisors who by themselves were not using ethnoveterinary knowledge. For these intermediary persons the term \"informant\" was used (e.g. informant 1 established the contact to DP23; Fig. 2 ).\n\nThirteen DP were recruited from the complementary medicine working groups, 12 from the organic farm research network of the FiBL, and further 37 farmers were recruited via regional information (Fig. 2) . The mother tongue of 41 DP was French (French Native Speakers, FNS), and German for the remaining 21 DP (German Native Speakers, GNS).\n\nEach of the 62 DP was associated to a single farm, of which 25 (40%) were organic and 37 (60%) were non-organic. Forty-four farms kept cattle, 22 farms hen, 18 farms horses, 15 farms goats, 15 sheep, 6 rabbits, 5 pigs, 3 kept donkeys, 3 kept bees, and 1 kept deer. The farms were located between 430 and 1250 m (808m \u00b1 194m) above sea level.\n\nThirty-two interviews were carried out with the DP only. In 27 cases, one or two family members, and in further 3 cases neighbours or farm staff were assisting the DP. All supplementary information from assisting persons were matched to the respective DP. In total, 93 persons aged between 28 and 87 years (54 \u00b1 14) were interviewed. Of these 59 were men (63%) and 34 (37%) were women.\n\nOpen, semi-structured interviews with DP were conducted from mid-February to end of April 2015 by the first author (DM) who is a native French speaker with an excellent command of German. The interviews were conducted in the mother tongue of the DP by using questionnaires in either French or German. In some interviews, language was occasionally switched if it helped to clarify specific points between DP and the interviewer. All information from one interview was assigned to the mother tongue of the DP.\n\nThe interviews took between 0.5 and 4.0 h and were recorded (WS-818 Digital Voice Recorder, Olympus, Hamburg, Germany) after a written consent of the DP.\n\nWith the aid of their local vernacular names, plants were identified during the interviews together with the DP, utilizing the Flora Helvetica (Lauber and Wagner, 2007) , by cross-checking (a) illustrations and, (b) distribution areas of the plant species. If plant material was available, further cross-checking was done based on information and material collected in earlier studies (Disler et al., 2014; Mayer et al., 2017; Stucki et al., 2019) . Commercial products and herbal drugs or extracts from commercial sources were identified with the aid of the package leaflet, or were considered as correctly delivered by the pharmacy or drug store. In the summer of 2015 nine dialog partners were revisited. A total of 27 herbarium voucher specimen of 16 plant species harvested from the wild were collected together with the dialog partner, dried, labelled, and deposited at the herbarium of the \"Basler Botanische Gesellschaft\". All plants for which voucher specimens were available from this and from former Swiss studies (Disler et al., 2014; Mayer et al., 2017; Stucki et al., 2019) are listed in Additional File 1.\n\nThe same definitions as in earlier studies were used (Disler et al., 2014; Bischoff et al., 2016; Mayer et al., 2017; Stucki et al., 2019) .\n\nHomemade remedy report ( The specification of use followed mainly the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system for veterinary medicinal products (ATCvet Code, WHO, 2018).\n\nTo estimate the dosing of plants, the weight of the amount of plant material used for a remedy was determined with a precision scale (EMB, 2000-2, Kern, Balingen, Germany). Whenever possible weight was determined using the original plant material of the farmer, or reference drugs of the interviewer on site. If this was not possible, the dosage was estimated by assessing the volume of plant material and measuring it subsequently by the interviewer. For orally administered remedies the oral daily dosage of medicinal plant (dry plant equivalent, dpe), and for externally administered remedies the concentration in g dpe per 100 g of final product was determined. Oral daily dosages were calculated in g dpe per kg metabolic bodyweight (kg 0.75 ) (L\u00f6scher et al., 2014) . The metabolic bodyweight was calculated with the average live weight of animal species and age classes described by Disler et al. (2014) , or based on additional information (Sambraus, 1996, \n\nThe degree of satisfaction of the DP with the reported use was determined using a visual analog scale of 100 mm, ranging from \"no effect\" (0 mm) to \"very good effect\" (100 mm) (Zealley, and Aitken, 1969) .\n\nA total of 345 homemade remedy reports were recorded during the 62 interviews. Between 1 and 13 remedies (6 \u00b1 3) per DP were reported, and they were associated with one to four different UR (1.2 \u00b1 0.5). A total of 121 plants species from 41 botanical families were reported.\n\nA total of 240 (70%) homemade remedies contained a single plant species (homemade single species herbal remedy reports, HSHR), and 31 (9%) homemade remedy reports were for mixtures with two to twenty-seven plant species. The remaining 74 (21%) were homemade remedy reports without use of plants, but contained natural products such as vinegar, wine, clay, honey, propolis or ashes.\n\nThe 240 HSHR referred to 77 different plant species belonging to 41 botanical families. Species of the family Asteraceae were most frequently used (34 HSHR, 14%), followed by Linaceae (28 HSHR, 12%), Rubiaceae (20 HSHR, 8%), Apiaceae (19 HSHR, 8%), Theaceae (15 HSHR, 6%), and Berberidaceae (13 HSHR, 5%; Table 2 ).\n\nThe most often reported plant species was Linum usitatissimum L. (28 HSHR; 12%), followed by Coffea L. (20 HSHR; 8%), Matricaria chamomilla L. (16 HSHR; 7%), Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze. (15 HSHR; 6%), and Sanicula europaea L. (13 HSHR; 5%). Eighteen plant species were reported for the first time for an ethnoveterinary use in Switzerland. Of these, ten were mentioned solely by FNS (Citrus x aurantium L., Fagopyrum esculentum Moench, Lavendula x intermedia Emeric ex Loisel, Matricaria discoidea DC., Polygonum aviculare L., Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus (L.) Domin, Rumex conglomeratus Murray, Sinapis alba L., Sorbus aucuparia L., Zingiber officinale Roscoe), and six solely by GNS (Atropa belladonna L., Cucumis sativus L., Hordeum vulgare L., Mentha longifolia (L.) L., Triticum aestivum L., Veratrum album L.). Additional two species (Oryza sativa L., Phyllitis scolopendrium (L.) Newman) were reported by both FNS and GNS.\n\nThe most frequently used plant parts were herbs (61 HSHR, 25%) and seeds (59 HSHR, 24%), followed by leaves (45 HSHR, 19%), flowers (35 HSHR, 15%), bark (12 HSHR, 5%), roots (12 HSHR, 5%), and fruits (7 HSHR, 3%). The remaining 9 HSHR (4%) included bulbs, resins, or unknown plant parts.\n\nFor 112 HSHR (47%) the plant material was purchased, for 110 HSHR (46%) gathered from the wild, and for 18 HSHR (8%) cultivated on farm. Dried plant material was used in 154 HSHR (64%), fresh plants were used in 71 HSHR (30%), while for 15 HSHR (6%) no information was available.\n\nIn more than half of the HSRH (142, 60%; Table 2 ), the remedies were prepared using an extraction process on farm. In 86 HSRH (35%) the plants were directly administered without prior extraction. This was mainly for oral or topical administration. Twelve HSHR (5%) comprised commercial products, out of which seven were essentials oils (Table 2 , Additional file 1).\n\nFor 125 HSHR an aqueous extraction was reported, either as infusion (92 HSRH), decoction (27 HSRH), or extraction at room temperature (6 HSRH). In 7 HSRH alcohol was used for extraction, and oil or fat in 10 HSRH. Sugar was used in one case to prepare a syrup from Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.\n\nThe weight of plant used to prepare the remedies could be determined for 173 HSHR (71%). In 78 cases the amount was directly measured on farm (in 26 cases with the original herbal drug, and in 52 cases with the reference drug of the interviewer). In 95 cases an approximate volume of plant was assessed, and the weight was determined afterwards by the interviewer. For 67 HSHR (29%) it was not possible to determine the amount of plant material used.\n\nA total of 289 use reports (UR) were collected for the 240 HSHR. Most of them were for cattle (219 UR, 76%), followed by 39 UR for horses (13%), and 31 UR (11%) for other animals, such as sheep, goats, hens and rabbits (Table 3 , Additional file 1). The majority of the UR were for treatment (225; 78%), while 64 UR (22%) were for prophylactic use, mainly for prevention of cattle ringworm (Berberis vulgaris L.), or in the peripartum period (Linum usitatissimum L., Achillea millefolium L.).\n\nGastrointestinal disorders and metabolic dysfunctions (QA; 111 UR, 38%) were the most often mentioned indication, followed by skin alterations and sores (QD; 97 UR, 34%). Other indications included infertility and diseases of female genitals (QG; 20 UR, 7%), diseases of the respiratory tract (QR; 13 UR, 5%), mastitis (QG52; 6 UR, 2%), musculoskeletal system (QM; 6 UR, 2%), and others, such as general strengthening (36 UR, 12%).\n\nThe most frequently reported plants for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders and metabolic dysfunctions were Linum usitatissimum L. (Table 3) .\n\nOral administration (168 UR, 58%) was most frequently used (Table 3) , mainly for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders like diarrhoeas, colic, constipation or rumination problems. The plants were mainly administered as infusion or decoction. Topical administration was described for 90 UR (31%), mainly for the treatment of altered and sore skin (71 UR), for disinfection of open wounds, or for the promotion of wound healing. Farmers used these HSRH as washes, compresses, or by direct application onto the skin of ointments, oils, tinctures, or fresh plants. Administration on intact skin (19 UR) was mainly described for the treatment of swellings, inflammations of joints, or other subcutaneous afflictions. Treatment of housing Table 1 Metabolic bodyweight (according to Disler et al., 2014, and Sambraus, 1996 environment was mentioned in 28 UR (10%). To prevent or treat cattle ringworm twigs of Berberis vulgaris L, Ilex aquifolium L., or Prunus spinosa L., hanged up in the stable. Finally, two UR were for intravaginal/intrauterine administration, and one UR with essential oil of lavender (Lavendula angustifolia Mill.) was used as an inhalant for calming nervous horses.\n\nFNS reported a total of 57 plant species connected to 180 UR, and GNS described 42 plant species and 109 UR. Thirty-five plant species were solely reported from FNS, and 20 solely from GNS, and these species were associated with one quarter of the respective UR each. Twenty-two plant species were reported by both FNS and GNS, and (15) 15 Herba (1) 1 Calendula officinalis L. (10) Flos (8) 1 g 1 2 4 Herba (2) 1 1 Achillea millefolium L. (3) Herba (3) 1 2 Other Asteraceae (5) (continued on next page) D. Mertenat, et al. Journal of Ethnopharmacology 246 (2020) 112184 were linked to three quarters of the respective UR. The degree of satisfaction of farmers with the treatments outcomes were evaluated for 247 UR, with an average value of 74 mm and no differences between the language groups (Fig. 3) .\n\nWith a survey covering bilingual regions of Switzerland we here published the first ethnoveterinary data from French speaking areas of Europe. A total of 62 DP were interviewed, and 289 UR based on 240 HSHR were documented, comprising 77 different plant species from 41 botanical families. Compared to previous ethnoveterinary surveys (PSES; Schmid et al., 2012; Disler et al., 2014; Bischoff et al., 2016; Mayer et al., 2017; Stucki et al., 2019) , 18 plant species were for the first time described for an ethnoveterinary use in Switzerland.\n\nThe methodology of the study was in accord with PSES. Most of the methodological recommendations for ethnopharmacological field studies were adhered to (Heinrich et al., 2018; Weckerle et al., 2018) . The short duration of the survey (3 months in early spring) was due to the heavy workload of DP during the rest of the year (Stucki et al., 2019) . Given that the survey had to be conducted outside of the vegetation period it was not possible to collect voucher specimen at the moment of the interviews. However, we collected some voucher specimen on some of the farms during the following summer (Additional file 1).\n\nThe cantons of Jura and Neuch\u00e2tel are officially French speaking, while Fribourg and Berne are officially bilingual (German and French). However, we considered only the French speaking Bernese Jura in our survey. Nevertheless, 41 DP were FNS, and 21 GNS. With one third of all DP, native German speakers appeared overrepresented if one considers the language distribution of the entire population of the study area (Bundesamt f\u00fcr Statistik, 2019). This may be due to the fact that German speaking Mennonites immigrating in the 18 th century to the Jura region (cantons of Berne and Jura) were predominantly farmers (Gerber, 1969) .\n\nIn general, farmers were satisfied with their treatment outcomes, and the mean value of 74 mm on the analog scale is comparable with values of PSES (70-80 mm).\n\nWe conducted the first comparative ethnoveterinary study with two populations of different mother tongues within the same geographic region of Europe. An earlier within-country comparison of two different linguistic regions of Switzerland (German and Italian) was characterized by topographical differences (lowland regions vs. southern mountain area; Mayer et al., 2017) , while a study in Romania compared ethnoveterinary data from a Hungarian speaking minority in a region of Transilvania with data from Transsilvania that had been gathered earlier, but without differentiation of the mother tongue of DP (Bartha et al., 2015) . To our knowledge, the only other study comparing traditional uses of two linguistic groups within the same geographic area was an ethnomedicinal survey conducted recently in north-eastern Spain (Menendec-Bacetta et al., 2015). (continued on next page) D. Mertenat, et al. Journal of Ethnopharmacology 246 (2020) 112184 When comparing the data from the present study with findings from PSES (Fig. 4, Additional file 2) , no difference between GNS (19% of the reported plant species are new for ethnoveterinary use in Switzerland) and FNS (22% of the reported plant species are new for ethnoveterinary use in Switzerland) was found. Furthermore, only 8% (FNS) and 10% (GNS) of the respective UR were connected to the 18 newly reported plant species, whereas three quarters of plant species connected to nine tenths of the UR were in accord with PSES, without a difference between FNS and GNS. Here were also no differences between FNS and GNS regarding the degree of satisfaction with their UR (Fig. 3) .\n\nOn first sight our findings are in contrast to Menendez-Bacetta et al. (2015) who found clear differences between Basque and Spanish speaking populations within the same geographic area. However, these differences were associated with political and cultural separatism. If separatist tendencies are missing as in our study area (Fig. 2) , different mother tongues of DP alone did not lead to significant differences in ethnoveterinary traditions.\n\nThere is increased interest of veterinarians in herbal medicine (Walkenhorst, 2017; Stucki et al., 2019) , and an undeniable need for possible therapeutic alternatives, in particular to reduce the use of antibiotics. Ethnoveterinary research may be an important source of knowledge on promising plant species and on dosage of administered remedies. As in earlier studies, we determined the quantity of administered plant material and compared with the dosage documented in PSES or in literature (Reichling et al., 2016; Wichtl, 2009; ESCOP, 2003; ESCOP, 2009, Tables 4 and 5) . We calculated oral daily doses for seven medicinal plants, including the first ethnoveterinary based dosage for Gentiana lutea L. (median 0.26g/kg 0.75 ). Our calculations were n.a. information not available. (1) (Melanthiaceae), Zingiber officinale Roscoe (1) (Zingiberaceae). g Parasites, general strengthening, behaviour, sensory organs, varia. h Sheep, goats, hens, rabbits. i Calendula ointment Sanicare (online pharmacy), Bombastus-Werke AG used in 1 remedy for 1 use report. j Arnica tincture (pharmacy) used in 1 remedy for 1 use report. k Comfrey gel (drugstore) used in 1 remedy for 1 use report. l Lavendula angustifolia oil (internet: aroma-zone.com) used in 2 remedies for 2 use report. m Lavendula x hybrid oil (internet: aroma-zone.com) with alcohol mixed, used in 1 remedy for 1 use report. n NJP Liniment (R) Swissgenetics (containing Mentha arvenses L. var. piperascens) used in 1 use report. o Plant part: twigs. p Plant Part: buds in two remedies, twigs in 3 remedies. q Plant part: buds.\n\nbased on information from at least three UR (Table 3 ). The medians of the determined dosages per kg metabolic body weight (kg 0.75 ) were similar to PSES, and to human and veterinary literature. However, as in PSES minimum and maximum values often differed by one to two orders of magnitude. Despite such big dosage ranges, placebo controlled studies in animals showed positive outcomes in the treatment groups, as was the case in studies with coneflower and garlic (Ayrle et al., 2016b (Ayrle et al., , 2017 . We calculated concentrations of five medicinal plants in finished products for external use, and the first dosage for Linum usitatissimum L. (median 6.25g/100g finished product). Again, the medians were similar to PSES, albeit slightly lower than recommended in human and veterinary literature (Table 5) .\n\nCorresponding with the outcomes of PSES and former European ethnoveterinary data (Mayer et al., 2014) the categories QA and QD were the most often mentioned indications with 72% of all UR.\n\nIn Europe, antimicrobials are most widely used to treat gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases of pigs, poultry, and for fattening cattle, in particular calves (European Medicines Agency, 2014; Schnyder et al., 2019) . Mastitis and endometritis are major problems in dairy cattle (Cabaret, 2003; Hovi et al., 2003) , and the most important reasons for the use of antibiotics in these animals (Oliver et al., 2011) . Consequently, the UR related to the QA, QR and QG (and in particular QG52; WHO, 2018) categories are of particular interest for possibly lowering the use of antibiotics. However, only a few UR were related to QG (26 UR) and QR (13 UR), and no single plant species stood out in terms of importance (Table 3) . For the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders (QA) black tea, coffee, chamomile, linseed and oak bark were the most frequently used herbal drugs.\n\nFarmers used infusions of black tea mainly to treat diarrhoea in calves. Black tea reportedly showed activity against bovine coronavirus and rotavirus (Friedman, 2007) which are among the main causes for diarrhoea and gastroenteritis in calves and cattle. Besides, antidiarrheal properties of black tea has been demonstrated in rodents (Besra et al., 2003; Hiller and Melzig, 2010) . The additional CNS stimulant properties of black tea (Einother and Martens, 2013) might be beneficial for lethargic calves. The antibacterial, antiadhesive, antidiarrheal and spasmolytic properties of black tea may be beneficial in gastrointestinal diseases. (Coffea L.,Coffeae semen) . As in PSES coffee was widely used, mainly to treat gastrointestinal disorders (QA) like constipation, colic, or rumination problems. Purine alkaloids reduce mental and physical fatigue, and chlorogenic acid stimulates gastric secretion (Hiller and Melzig, 2010) . There is some previous evidence that coffee may be helpful to treat and prevent polyfactorial infectious diseases in calves (Ponepal et al., 1996) .\n\nPreparations with chamomile were used as an infusion mainly to treat diarrhoea in calves. Chamomile flavonoids showed spasmolytic effects on bovine intestinal smooth muscles (Mendel et al., 2016) . Chamomile also exhibited in vitro antibacterial properties against pathogens relevant in gastrointestinal disorders of youngstock (Ayrle et al., 2016a) . In vivo studies also show protective effects in gastric ulcera in mouse and rats (ESCOP, 2003; Cemek et al., 2010) , and antidiarrheal properties in rats (Sebai et al., 2014). 4.2.1.4. Linseeds (Linum usitatissimum L., Lini semen) . A decoction of whole linseeds was orally administered to treat diarrhoea in calves. Farmers also used linseed to treat constipation and ruminating troubles, and a poultice was administered in ruminitis. Anti-inflammatory, antidiarrheal, and spasmolytic properties of linseeds are well known (ESCOP, 2003; Ayrle et al., 2016a) , and linked to the content in mucilaginous polysaccharides. Linseeds are recommended to treat gastric inflammation and obstipation (ESCOP, 2003; Reichling et al., 2016). 4.2.1.5. Oak bark (Quercus robur L., Quercus cortex) . Farmers treated diarrhoea in calves with infusions or decoctions of oak bark, or fed oak bark powder directly. The high content in tannins is responsible for the antidiarrheal properties (Reichling et al., 2008) . Oak bark extracts furthermore possess antibacterial and anti-quorum sensing activities (Deryabin and Tolmacheva, 2015) .\n\nMarigold (Calendula officinalis L.), St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) and wood sanicle (Sanicula europaea L.) were the most frequently used plants for the treatment of skin disorders. While the therapeutic potential of marigold and St. John's Wort in veterinary medicine is recognized (Tresch et al., 2019) , wood sanicle is poorly studied and merits further investigation.\n\nWood sanicle (Sanicula europaea L., Saniculae folium et flos).\n\nWood sanicle was already reported in PSES, but only with few UR. However, in an earlier ethnobotanical study on human use of medicinal plants in the canton of Jura, wood sanicle was one of the most often reported species. Use of wood sanicle thus appears to be a distinct particularity of the study area (Broquet, 2006) . In the D. Mertenat, et al. Journal of Ethnopharmacology 246 (2020) 112184 present survey, farmers used infusions of leaves or flowers to treat wounds or scars. Washing the injured skin or a direct application on the skin with a bandage were mentioned. Wood sanicle contains saponins as major phytochemicals, and is has also been used in human folk medicine (Hiller and Melzig, 2010) . Anti-inflammatory activity of wood sanicle has been reported (Jacker and Hiller, 1976; Vogl et al., 2013) .\n\nCompared to PSES, UR related to horses as target species were much higher in the present survey area (39 UR, 13%). This was likely due to the importance of horse breeding in this region (about 1400 farms kept horses). Apart from a study from the canton of Berne (Ryhner et al., 2018) referring to 27 plant species, recent European ethnoveterinary data in horses are scarce (Mayer et al., 2014) .\n\nIn category QA, Coffea L. and Linum usitatissimum L. were documented for the same indication as for cattle. In category QD, farmers used Sanicula europaea L. (7 UR), Calendula officinalis L., and Hypericum perforatum L.. In category QM, Arnica montana L., Harpagophytum procumbens (Burch.) DC ex Meisn., Equisetum arvense L., and Zingiber officinale Roscoe were used to treat sprains and degenerative joint diseases. In category QR, Phyllitis scolop\u00e9ndrium (L.) Newman was used to treat cough, whereby the dried plant was directly administered orally. In vitro antimicrobial activity of Phyllitis scolop\u00e9ndrium (L.) Newman against pathogenic bacteria has been reported (Ferrazzano et al., 2013) . Additional plants species mentioned in category QR were Abies alba Mill. and Citrus limon (L.) Osbeck.\n\nLavandula angustifolia Mill. was administered to calm nervous horses. Interestingly, this traditional use was recently corroborated in a clinical study with foals (Poutaraud et al., 2018) .\n\nThe plants most frequently reported by farmers in our current survey are inexpensive, easily available, and well known for human and veterinary medicinal purpose (Leonti and Verpoorte, 2017; Stucki et al., 2019) . The phytochemistry, pharmacological properties, and therapeutic effectiveness is documented with numerous research publications and reviews (Ayrle et al., 2016a; Tresch et al., 2019) . The use of complementary medicine and homemade remedies by farmers may help to lower the use of antibiotics . However, medicinal plants cannot replace antibiotics and other modern veterinary medicinal products, not the least for reasons of animal welfare. Nevertheless, a meaningful use of medicinal plants by veterinarians may limit the use of antibiotics and other modern veterinary medicinal products to particularly severe diseases. More clinical veterinary studies with medicinal plants are needed, and veterinary education as well as national strategies to control and combat the development of microbial resistance should take into account the use of medicinal plants as a means to reduce the use of antibiotics (StAR, 2015) .\n\nFarmers of mainly French speaking regions of Switzerland reported a total of 77 medicinal plants to treat and prevent livestock diseases. Of (Schmid et al., 2012; Disler et al., 2014; Bischoff et al., 2016; Mayer et al., 2017; Stucki et al., 2019) . All plant species are given in Additional file 2. D. Mertenat, et al. Journal of Ethnopharmacology 246 (2020) 112184 D. Mertenat, et al. Journal of Ethnopharmacology 246 (2020) 112184 these, 18 were mentioned for the first time in a Swiss ethnoveterinary context. We found no obvious difference in ethnoveterinary knowledge between French and German native speakers. The most widely used plants are easily available and well known for human and veterinary purposes. Taking into account the current phytochemical knowledge, and in vitro and in vivo studies, several plants reported by farmers could be considered as promising treatment options for gastrointestinal and dermatological disorders in cattle and horses. The use of such plants and finished products could help to reduce, at least to a certain degree, the use of antibiotics. Thus, our findings may contribute to international strategies for limiting the use of antibiotics.\n\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests. "}
