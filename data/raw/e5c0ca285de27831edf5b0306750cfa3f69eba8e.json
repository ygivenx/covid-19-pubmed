Additional funding and planning are required by member countries to contain this threat. Future meetings will need to focus on creative and innovative ways to inform policy and initiatives for vaccination, surveillance and management of influenza-related morbidity and mortality especially among the most vulnerable groups of the population. The MENA-ISN roadmap is now available to help achieving the network's goals.\n\nEmerging infectious diseases are a major public health problem in the EMR region. Besides, more than half of the 22 countries of the EMR are affected by acute or protracted complex emergencies. Elderly individuals are also at high risk of influenza-related hospitalization and death. 6, 7 Frailty is defined as \"a state of increased vulnerability to poor resolution of homoeostasis after a stressor event\", which increases the risk of adverse outcomes, 8 found to reduce hospital admission with respiratory illness [16] [17] [18] and to be cost-saving. 19, 20 Finally, a recombinant influenza vaccine has been shown to provide a better protection in older adults than the standard quadrivalent, inactivated influenza vaccine. 21 At present, the availability of these newer vaccine products is limited in many settings, and where available, they may be cost-prohibitive. With this in mind, implementing a realistic vaccination strategy with available product in order to improve influenza vaccine coverage should be considered as the first-line strategy with whatever influenza vaccine available in a given country.\n\nIn summary, despite enhanced influenza surveillance systems, a higher number of NICs that actively perform influenza virus typing and more available information on influenza burden in the region, the current situation is not satisfactory. Key challenges for the future are sustainability, good quality data and more privateacademic collaborations under a common scientific umbrella. A unified group of committed national experts, that is MENA-ISN with joint multisectoral and multidisciplinary efforts, will help to get further than individual efforts. The network can be the active advocate for acceptance of vaccination by HCPs and the public, by bringing key local stockholders together, explaining benefits of seasonal influenza vaccination and addressing misinformation.\n\nDissemination of surveillance and disease burden data through publications and effective communication tools will help to push health authorities in favour of official recommendations for influenza vaccination.\n\nThis work was supported by Fondation M\u00e9rieux and an unrestricted grant from Sanofi Pasteur.\n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest to report.\n\nMitra Saadatian-Elahi https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1265-8806\n\nSibongile Walaza https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7588-2480"}
