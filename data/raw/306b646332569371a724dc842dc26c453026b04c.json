{"title": "A Clinical Perspective of Necrotizing Enterocolitis: Past, Present, and Future", "body": "Age of onset is inversely related to the postmenstrual age (PMA) at birth (Fig. 1 B) . 7 In term infants, NEC is commonly associated with congenital heart diseases such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome and coarctation of the aorta which result in intestinal hypoxia and/or hypoperfusion. 8 NEC has also been associated with other anomalies including aganglionosis 9 and gastroschisis. 10 More than 85% of all NEC cases occur in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (<1500g) or in very premature (VP) infants (<32 weeks PMA). 11 The prevalence of NEC varies among centers. Multicenter and large population-based studies demonstrate that it is prevalent in 7-11% of VLBW infants. [11] [12] [13] The National Institute of Child Health (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network (NRN) study reported a 7% prevalence rate of NEC in a population of 11,072 VLBW infants during 1999-2001. 14 The Vermont Oxford Network (VON) also reported a similar prevalence rate (7.4%) in 71,808 VLBW infants during a study period from 2005 to 2006. 15 A concurrent NICHD-NRN study from 2003 to 2007 found that the prevalence of NEC remained high (11%) among very premature infants (born at 22-28 weeks PMA, BW 401-1500g). 13 The prevalence of NEC appears to be less in Europe and Canada. A recent Swedish study found that 5.8% of infants born before 27 weeks PMA developed NEC among a cohort of 638 infants. 16 A Swiss neonatal network study reported that only 3-4% of infants born at less than 32 weeks PMA during 2000-2004 developed NEC. 17 The Canadian Neonatal Network documented that 5.1% of infants born earlier than 33 weeks PMA developed NEC during 2003-2008 in a population of 16,669 infants. 18 Despite the improvement in survival of VLBW infants, neonatal NEC remains quite prevalent in the US (0.3 to 2.4 infants per 1000 live births). 19 The overall mortality for NEC ranges from 20-40% but approaches 100% in infants with the most severe form of the disease. 12, 15, 20 Males have a higher risk of death than females. 12 Earlier studies have reported a slight increase in the prevalence of NEC among African-American and male infants, but more recent studies have failed to verify these observations. 12 Because NEC afflicts 2-5% of all NICU admissions and causes serious morbidity, NEC continues to impose a heavy burden on neonatal population. 19 \n\nThe pathophysiology of NEC in VP infants is not completely elucidated. Compared to NEC in term and late preterm infants in whom hypoxia-ischemia is a common precursor, recent advances in our understanding of NEC at the molecular level suggest that an inflammatory response in VP infants plays the inciting or dominant role in the pathogenesis of NEC. 21, 22 Previously held beliefs that low Apgar scores, 23 umbilical catheterizations, episodes of apnea and bradycardia, respiratory distress syndrome, anemia, hypothermia, hypoxicischemic events, [24] [25] [26] [27] hypotension, and the use of vasoactive agents such as Indocin 25 and pressors are important contributing causes of NEC in premature infants have not been supported by large epidemiological and more recent clinical studies. 6 Although hemorrhagic-ischemic necrosis is the terminal manifestation of NEC in premature infants, the interaction among milk substrate, microbes, and the immature host immunologic system is now thought to be key in initiating the pathogenesis of NEC (Fig. 2 ). 22\n\nIn premature infants, aggressive feeding may cause stasis of milk substrate in the lumen of the GIT due to dysmotility. 28 Stasis can lead to intestinal dilatation with fluid and gas and possibly to impairment of the intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB). [29] [30] [31] The development of endotoxemia in stable premature infants after feeding and evidence from other studies support that the IEB of the premature infant is \"leakier \" compared to that of a more mature infant. [31] [32] [33] [34] Intestinal dilatation in the presence of abnormal microbial colonization (dysbiosis) can distort normal signal transduction (cross-talk) across the IEB and alter the normal message of growth and repair of enterocytes to one that instead produces excessive inflammation, apoptosis and necrosis (Fig. 3) . 32, 34, 35 \n\nIn recent years, a number of reports have attempted to establish a causal relationship between blood transfusion (BT) and NEC. [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] These studies propose that BT for anemia of prematurity in relatively stable growing premature infants increases the risk of late onset NEC. We believe that additional prospective reports that use more robust design and analysis are needed before a causative relationship can be accepted because of the weaknesses in study designs of these investigations (e.g., failure to include all blood transfusions, retrospective nature of data collection, lack of appropriate case-control matching, and failure to control for confounding variables). A recently completed prospective matched case-control investigation that used robust methodology does not substantiate an association between blood transfusion and NEC.\n\nAt the mucosal surface, signals from microbial ligands like endotoxin [synonymous with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)], flagellin, lipoteichoic acid, peptidoglycans, and formylated peptides are communicated through a sophisticated process (cross talk) to appropriate epithelial receptors specific for that ligand referred as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including TLRs (Toll like receptors), FPRs (formylated peptide receptors), and NODs (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domains). 35 Activation of these PRRs initiates regulatory pathways including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor kB (NF\u03baB), and caspase-dependent pathways (Fig. 3) . 22, 29, 35, [43] [44] [45] These interrelated complex pathways determine mucosal and submucosal responses. Based upon the perception of interrelated signals, the response can be cytoprotective (i.e., promoting growth and repair) or it can be destructive if apoptosis or inflammatory responses is triggered ( Figure 3 ). 22, 35, 44 The terminal event in NEC is hemorrhagic-ischemic necrosis, which is the consequence of a dysregulated inflammatory response mediated by endogenous factors that include platelet activating factor (PAF), proinflammatory cytokines [such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, Interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6)], chemokines (MIP-2/CXCL2), NF-\u03baB, and the complement system. 29 Due to the relative immaturity of key gastrointestinal functions such as digestion, absorption, motility and abnormalities in immune responses, a premature newborn is exquisitely vulnerable to gastrointestinal injury. 46 The cellular response to signal transduction as described above is orchestrated by the innate immune system in mucosa and submucosa. 45, 47 Microbial interaction with intestinal epithelium (PRRS) signals tissuespecific functions such as T-cell expansion and elaboration of cytokines and chemokines. Normally after birth, exposure to LPS down-regulates IRAK (IL-1 receptor associated kinase 1, an intermediary for epithelial TLR4 signaling) and promotes tolerance to LPS. 19, 22, 43 This postnatal adaptation helps to achieve hostmicrobe homeostasis with microbial tolerance. 22, 44 The premature infant is exposed shortly after birth to a massive microbial antigenic challenge that may be distorted by frequent and prolonged use of antibiotics. As a result, the GIT of the premature infant gravitates toward mounting an inflammatory response rather than establishing tolerance (Th-1 response). 30, 35, 47 The premature infant appears to mimic a response that is similar to the immune-na\u00efve response demonstrated by the fetus which is characterized by hyper-responsiveness to LPS. 22, 48 Intestinal colonization with commensal Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species reduces the risk of NEC. 49, 50 The frequent and prolonged use of antibiotics results in an overgrowth of potentially pathogenic species. 51 Distortion of intestinal microecology by exposure to broad spectrum antibiotics may result in colonization with inflammogenic microbial consortia that are more likely to direct the immune-repertoire in the direction of an inflammatory response, thereby increasing the risk for NEC. 51, 52 Metagenomic-studies indicate that intestinal microecology during the early postnatal period greatly influences the evolution of immune health. 53, 54 Infants who later develop NEC show evidence for a dysbiotic microecology prior to the diagnosis of NEC. 55 A recent clinical study found that exposure to broad spectrum antibiotics for more than 10 days increased the risk of NEC nearly by three fold. 51 Recent advances in the proteomics and microecology pertinent to NEC strongly suggest that a distorted innate-immune response of the premature infant increases the vulnerability to NEC. 22, 55 Glucocorticoid-mediated maturation of the IEB has been shown to protect against NEC and to blunt the inflammatory response seen in NEC. 46, 48, 56, 57 Furthermore, the vulnerability to NEC is not unique to premature neonates, it is also seen in the older immune-compromised population. 58-60 A NEC-like illness has been described in the geriatric population and in HIV-patients. 58, 61 \n\nUnder normal conditions a state of high intestinal blood flow and low resting vascular resistance is maintained by nitric oxide. 26 Impaired endothelial function or elaboration of pro-inflammatory mediators may alter the balance between vasoconstriction (as mediated by endothelin-1) and vasodilatation (as mediated by nitric oxide) and lead to a relatively ischemic state. In animal models of hypoxia-ischemia, derangements of intestinal microcirculation develop at the premucosal arteriolar inflow location with a distinct \"stopand-go\" pattern consistent with severe vascular dysfunction. 62 Levels of inflammatory mediators increase markedly in real-time animal models of NEC. 62, 63, 64 Elaboration of inflammatory mediators (e.g., PAF) early in the pathogenesis of NEC may have important secondary effects on local circulation that contribute to the development of the intestinal necrosis. 19, 27, 43, [64] [65] [66] \n\nDespite 4 decades of exhaustive search, no consistent single microbial species has been isolated from NEC infants. 67 Enterobacteriaceae sp. are most common, followed by Staphylococcus sp and Clostridium sp. 19, [68] [69] [70] [71] Outbreaks of NEC linked to consumption of formula contaminated by Enterobacter sakazaki and breast milk contaminated by Staphylococci have occurred. [70] [71] [72] Although bacteria are most commonly associated with NEC, several enteric viruses (rotavirus, echovirus, coronavirus, torovirus, norovirus) and Candida sp have also been described. [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] Generally, NEC occurs sporadically, but may also occur in clusters or outbreaks. 82 Temporal clustering of such outbreaks and their cessation with implementation of infection control measures support an association of these outbreaks with a single transmissible agent during a given outbreak. 83, 84 As cited above, varieties of organisms including bacteria and viruses have been linked to outbreaks of NEC. Among viruses, norovirus (NoV), astrovirus, torovirus, coronavirus, and rotavirus have been linked with outbreaks of hemorrhagic gastroenteritis and necrotizing enterocolitis. 76, 80, [85] [86] [87] In a recent study, compared to infants with rotavirus or norovirus enteritis, infants with astrovirus were more likely to develop NEC and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. 88 Viral enterotoxin, such as the non-structural protein (NSP4) of rotavirus, stimulates a Ca ++ dependent secretory response that results in watery diarrhea in mature infants but hemorrhagic enteritis or NEC in premature infants. 76, 89 This viral enterotoxin induces an age-and dose-dependent response. 89 NSP4 increases paracellular permeability and alters the integrity of the IEB. It binds with caveolin-1 (scaffolding protein) and alters tight junction assembly. [90] [91] [92] Consequently, a weakened IEB permits the translocation of microbes and the initiation of endotoxemia and the inflammatory response characteristic of NEC. 91 Irrespective whether a pathogen can be identified during a local epidemic of NEC, implementation of infection control measures are effective in stopping the outbreak. 82, 84, 93, 94 \n\nInvestigators during the 1980's found that NEC occurred more commonly in preterm infants between 33-35 weeks PMA. 95, 96 More recent studies have found that a peak distribution of NEC at 29-31 weeks PMA (Fig. 4) . 7 This shift to an earlier PMA may be a reflection of the current practice to introduce enteral feedings earlier compared to the delayed feeding practices of the 1980's. 95, 96 The clinical presentation of NEC can range from non-specific signs that progress insidiously over several days to a fulminant onset of gastrointestinal signs, multiorgan system dysfunction and shock over a few hours. 6 Early signs of NEC are non-specific and may be indistinguishable from those of sepsis. 5, 6, 11, 29, 95, 96 Clinical signs include both intestinal and systemic perturbations. Intestinal signs in early NEC can present as feeding intolerance that may manifest as increased pre-feeding gastric residuals, emesis, abdominal distension, and bloody stools (hematochezia). Less commonly, when the stomach is involved, NEC can present as bloody emesis or a bloody gastric residual. 96, 97 During the advanced stage of NEC, the abdomen may appear shiny, distended and erythematous. The infant generally prefers to assume a \"frog leg\" position (position of comfort, see Fig. 5 A) and is hyporesponsive. 6,95-97 On gentle palpation, the abdomen may feel firm, tense, and tender, and a tender mass may be palpable. Bowel perforation may cause the abdomen to appear blue or discolored. 6, [95] [96] [97] An infant with a blue discolored abdomen secondary to isolated intestinal perforation may be indistinguishable from an infant with NEC. In a male infant, erythema or bluish discoloration of the scrotum may appear if peritoneal fluid from perforated bowel herniates into the scrotum (Fig. 5 B) .\n\nVery premature infants do not manifest tenderness and guarding unless NEC is advanced. Therefore, a high index of suspicion is required to establish a diagnosis of NEC if multiple subtle signs appear that produce a deviation from baseline clinical status. 6, 7 NEC can also present with bloody stools (hematochezia) without any other initial signs, especially when NEC involves the distal colon. If the jejunum and terminal ileum are the predominant sites of NEC, then emesis, increased gastric residuals, and/or abdominal distension are the more likely initial clinical signs. [98] [99] Occult hematochezia diagnosed by a hemoccult test correlates poorly with NEC. 100 Extremely premature infants with NEC are more likely to present with abdominal distension, ileus, and emesis. They are less likely to present with pneumatosis but are more likely to develop pneumoperitoneum compared to late term or term infants (Fig. 6. A and  B ). Observation of a lightly bile-stained gastric residual in the VP infant, especially prior to any feeding, is common and normally resolves as gradual advancement of feeding volumes elicits improvement in intestinal motility. Consistent dark green bilious gastric residual may indicate GI obstruction and requires further investigation. 99 Systemic signs include lethargy, hypotension, poor perfusion and pallor, increased episodes of apnea and bradycardia, worsening of respiratory function, temperature instability, tachycardia, hyperglycemia, or hypoglycemia. [96] [97] [98] [99] Abnormal laboratory tests include anemia, left shift of neutrophils, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, metabolic acidosis, and hyponatremia. 99, 101 In some instances NEC may present as unexplained hyponatremia. Concurrent bacteremia and sepsis occurs in 40-60% of NEC cases. 98, 99, [101] [102] [103] Sepsis due to Gram-negative bacteria is more common. 98, 103 Conversely, if an infant presents with sepsis due to gram negative bacteria and non-specific intestinal and radiographic signs, there is a greater likelihood that NEC is the underlying cause of this illness. 103 In 5-6% of cases, NEC may recur. 98, 104 Recurrence is more likely if the initial episode of NEC was associated with congenital heart disease or with rotavirus. Recurrence can also occur with cow milk protein allergy. 105, 106 However, NEC can recur after either medical or surgical NEC without specific risk factors. 98, 104 \n\nIntramural gas or pneumatosis and portal venous gas are pathognomonic signs of NEC. They may appear even before clinical signs. Absence of these radiographic signs by no means confirms the absence of NEC. Pneumatosis is due to gas within the bowel wall and may appear linear (like railroad tracks) or circular if gas is subserosal or bubbly if gas is submucosal (Fig. 7) . 107, 108 Bubbly gas lucencies could also indicate air within intraluminal fecal material. Pneumatosis is more commonly seen in the right lower quadrant but it can be seen anywhere as necrosis may involve any section of bowel extending from the stomach to the rectum. 98, 107, 108 The amount of pneumatosis does not always relate to the severity of disease, and its disappearance does not necessarily imply pathologic or clinical improvement. 7,98,107,108 Other non-specific but common abdominal radiographic findings include thickened bowel walls, dilated bowel loops, a paucity of bowel gas, and a fixed dilated loop (Fig. 8) . 107, 108 Inflamed, edematous and hemorrhagic bowel wall may be separated from each other because of thickening of bowel wall and the normal sausage like mosaic configuration may be lost. A persistent fixed dilated loop may indicate a necrotic bowel loop. Dilated gas-filled loops in the central abdomen may indicate the presence of ascites or free peritoneal fluid, because dilated bowel loops float (and migrate to the least dependent region of the abdomen) when peritoneal fluid is present. 107,108 A paucity of bowel gas may be associated with ileus and abdominal decompression. These non-specific signs may not be diagnostic of NEC, but nonetheless are non-reassuring and suspicious for NEC thereby warranting immediate intervention and treatment implementation. 107, 108 Pneumatosis intestinalis can extend to the portal venous circulation and typically appear as curvilinear lucencies over the hepatic silhouette in a plain radiograph (Figure 7) . 98 A pneumoperitoneum is diagnostic of a perforated viscus. In a supine position it may appear as rounded or oval extraluminal lucency beneath the upper anterior abdominal wall (Fig. 9) . When there is a large pneumoperitoneum, it may outline the falciform ligament giving it the appearance of a longitudinal strip of sutures in a football (American football and rugby, but not soccer ball), leading to its designation as the \"football sign\" (Fig. 9 ). 107,108 A crosstable lateral film may demonstrate small air collection just beneath the abdomen (Fig. 9) . A small pneumoperitoneum may be difficult to visualize on a single plain film. A left lateral decubitus film will allow free air to rise to the top over a non-dependent surface facilitating visualization of an abnormal lucency. A small amount of free air may present as small triangular or a rectangular lucency and make a definitive diagnosis of free air difficult. Sometimes free air may present as 'double-wall sign\" when the entire bowel loop is outlined and gas is present along serosal and mucosal surfaces. 107, 108 A non-ionic water soluble contrast study (typically, an upper GI series followed by an enema) can be obtained in circumstances when anatomic GI obstruction is suspected. 108 Hypertonic water-soluble agents are not routinely recommended because hypovolemia can result from a shift of fluid from the intravascular space to the intestinal lumen. 108\n\nIn situations where radiographic signs are non-specific, the abdominal ultrasound (US) is another modality that can identify even small volumes of free gas. US is also the preferred modality for visualization of abdominal fluid and ascites.Thickness and echogenicity of the bowel wall and qualitative assessment of peristalsis can also be visualized best by US color Doppler can be used to assess arterial perfusion of the bowel wall (Fig. 10) . Portal venous gas can be more readily seen using abdominal sonography than plain film. 108 Faingold et al used color Doppler sonography and demonstrated 100% sensitivity for free air and absent blood flow (necrotic gut) compared to 40% sensitivity by radiography. 109 The use of CT (Computed Tomography) is not advocated for the diagnosis of NEC. 108\n\nWhen an infant is suspected to have NEC, all enteral feedings and medications should be discontinued (Fig. 11 ). Prompt decompression of the GIT should be accomplished by placement of a double lumen gastric tube (large lumen for aspiration and small lumen for irrigation and venting) with institution of low constant suction. Aspirated volume should be replaced with intravenous Ringer's Lactate solution with extra potassium chloride that is lost in gastric output. It is crucial to ensure the patency of the tube. If the abdomen continues to distend despite ongoing continuous suction, the tube should be checked for proper placement and for blockage and nasal CPAP should be discontinued. Endotracheal intubation is preferred in an infant who is deteriorating and has frequent episodes of apnea. Intravascular volume must be monitored rigorously to ensure adequate tissue perfusion and may be gauged by frequent assessment of serum electrolytes, hematocrit, and urinary output. As a rule of thumb, anticipation of third-spacing in infants with NEC will require 1 \u00bd maintenance fluid plus replacement of gastric output. Failure to maintain euvolemia and proper electrolyte repletion can result in shock with hypochloremia, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia. Parenteral nutrition should be started early with adequate protein (3.5-4g/kg/ day) to maintain positive nitrogen balance and to allow repair of injured tissue. 6, 46, [110] [111] [112] Strict implementation of infection control measures is critical. Following culture of blood and urine, prompt initiation of treatment with appropriate broad spectrum antibiotics based on known sensitivities of prevalent pathogens in the individual NICU is vital. If surgical intervention is performed, peritoneal fluid and intestinal tissue should be sent for gram stain, culture, and sensitivity. The utility of a stool culture for bacteria in a neonate has been questioned because fecal matter has many bacterial species. However, during outbreaks of NEC, attempts should be made to identify the infectious agent whenever possible. Usual regimens include ampicillin (or a cephalosporin) and gentamicin (or other aminoglycoside). Addition of a third antibiotic that provides anaerobic coverage (e.g., clindamycin or flagyl) is indicated when there is evidence of peritonitis or bowel perforation (Fig. 11) . Inflammation of the intestine and peritoneum is excruciatingly painful; therefore, attention to pain control and minimal handling during cares are integral parts of management. 6, 46, [110] [111] [112] Hematocrit should be monitored and packed red cells be provided to replace occult intestinal hemorrhage. Adjunctive treatment includes judicious correction of significant thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and metabolic acidosis. Abdominal girth should be measured frequently; a sudden increase in abdominal girth warrants an immediate abdominal radiograph to assess for a pneumoperitoneum. Co-management with pediatric surgeons is recommended when a diagnosis of NEC is strongly suspected or confirmed. In a sick infant who is not improving despite supportive medical management and in whom NEC is suspected, consultation with a pediatric surgeon and radiologist may help to arrive at a specific diagnosis. 6, 46, 108, [110] [111] [112] [113] [114] In the most premature infants a high index of suspicion is required to make a timely diagnosis of NEC because these infants are less likely to manifest tenderness and the pathognomonic radiographic findings of NEC. 7 By the time a VP infant manifests tenderness or abdominal mass, NEC has usually progressed to an advanced stage. 7\n\nIdentification of a pneumoperitoneum due to bowel perforation and the presence of necrotic bowel (either may be difficult to diagnose) are two absolute indications for surgical intervention. Severe and persistent metabolic acidosis and/or thrombocytopenia in conjunction with lack of improvement with medical management strongly suggest the presence of necrotic bowel and warrant surgery (Fig. 11) . 7, 98, 101, 103, 111, [113] [114] The timely diagnosis of bowel perforation or dead gut can be difficult in extremely premature infants with NEC. 7 A negative laparotomy is just as detrimental as failure to recognize perforation early in this group of patients. 108 Pneumoperitoneum can be missed in about 20% cases of bowel perforation. 108 In such cases, the use of 7 point scoring system, using 7 components that quantitate the presence of metabolic derangement, in conjunction with an infant's ongoing evaluation by a pediatric surgeon has been found to optimize the timing the surgical intervention. 115 These metabolic derangements include severe metabolic acidosis, severe thrombocytopenia, hypotension, hyponatremia, neutropenia, left shift of neutrophils, and positive blood culture. This scoring system is recommended to be used only as an adjunct to careful serial clinical and radiologic evaluation of an infant. 109, 111, 115 With respect to the type of surgery, primary peritoneal drainage (PPD) has emerged as an alternative to laparotomy in VP infants with bowel perforation. 101, 116 Peritoneal drainage serves as a definitive treatment for some patients and as a temporizing measure for unstable sick infants until laparotomy can be performed after their stabilization. [116] [117] [118] [119] [120] The choice of PPD or laparotomy as a primary surgical intervention has been argued for a decade. [117] [118] [119] In their review of only two RCT's, Rao et al report that there were no differences with respect to mortality and duration for total parenteral nutrition between the drainage and lapartomy. 117 However, these studies did not distinguish between isolated perforation and NEC. 121 Neither of these two trials reached the recruitment target nor showed improved survival from PPD or laparotomy. One of these two trials (NET from UK) found that 74% of infants initially treated with PPD required a \"rescue laparotomy\"; The second NICHD NRN trial did not encourage \"rescue laparotomy\" (which nonetheless was allowed) and did not distinguish NEC from isolated intestinal perforation (IIP). 118, 119, 120 This latter trial, conducted in extremely low birth weight infants (\u2264 1000g), found that laparotomy had an advantage over PPD with respect to the likelihood of survival and better neurodevelopmental outcome at 18 to 22 months of age. 121 Death or impairment occurred in 78% of the drainage group and in 66% of the laparotomy group.\n\nThe ability to accurately distinguish NEC from IIP is important when making a comparison between PPD and laparotomy because mortality associated with NEC is greater than with IIP. 121, 122 A large single center prospective study showed that bowel perforation in infants with severe NEC who were treated with primary laparotomy fared better than infants treated with a PPD. 101, 122, 123 Conversely, infants with IIP fared better with PPD. These investigators devised the 7 point metabolic derangement score and used it in conjunction with ultrasonography or contrast imaging to distinguish NEC from IIP.\n\nOther traditional surgical procedures at laparotomy include debridement and the resection of clearly necrotic bowel and creation of an enterostomy. 114, 121, 122 Sometimes multiple excisions are needed to preserve bowel length. Viable ends of bowel are exteriorized as stomas with the distal end as a mucous fistula. Sometimes single stoma with a Hartmann's pouch is created. In this procedure a colostomy or ileostomy is created and the distal limb is closed by suturing it and placing it back in the peritoneal cavity as a temporary measure until patient is ready for reanastomosis. 111, 114, 124 PATHOLOGY Coagulation (hemorrhagic-ischemic) necrosis, inflammation, and bacterial overgrowth are salient features of the histopathology of NEC. Reparative tissue changes such as epithelial regeneration, formation of granulation tissue, and fibrosis are found in two-thirds of cases and provide evidence for a duration of tissue injury/reparation processes of at least several days. 125, 126 Damage to the intestinal tract may range from mucosal injury to full-thickness necrosis with focal perforation. Gas bubbles (pneumatosis intestinalis) can be seen in mucosa, submucosa and serosal surfaces (Fig. 12) . 126 Although NEC can involve the entire gut from stomach to distal colon (NEC totalis), disease is most commonly found in the terminal ileum and ascending colon. Rotavirusassociated NEC most often involves the distal colon. 76 NEC can cause focal disease or manifest as multiple large diffuse necrotic areas alternating with patches of unaffected bowel. Serosal exudation without obvious perforation can also occur. In mild stages of NEC, intense congestion of superficial mucosa can result in focal necrosis of villous tips and epithelial sloughing into bowel lumen. 125, 126 \n\nIt is more common for extremely premature infants with NEC to develop pneumoperitoneum than pneumatosis. 7 This population is also more vulnerable to IIP. Infants with IIP are generally more stable but they can develop peritonitis and sepsis syndrome mimicking NEC. 25, 101, 103 Generally, IIP presents during the first week of life and has been commonly associated with early indocin prophylaxis against intraventricular hemorrhage or patent ductus arteriosus (Table) . 25 Pathologically IIP is a focal perforation without an inflammatory component. It is not associated with feeding and does not present as hemorrhagic ischemic necrosis. 25 In contrast with the multifactorial pathogenesis of NEC, IIP usually develops suddenly without clinical evidence of intestinal inflammation. 25 The propensity for these focal lesions to occur in the watershed areas of terminal ileum or jejunum supports the theory of arterial occlusion with embolism. 25, [127] [128] [129] Arterial rectae are end arteries that supply intestinal villi. [127] [128] [129] Persistence of right to left shunt through a patent foramen ovale or PDA during the early critical postnatal period presents a scenario for arterial embolism that potentially can create lesions similar to IIP especially when these lesions occur near the antimesenteric border. 25\n\nSepsis can masquerade in a manner similar to NEC. 6 Many intestinal and systemic signs of sepsis also are characteristic of NEC. Specifically, ileus, hypotension, respiratory deterioration, thrombocytopenia, metabolic acidosis, left shift of neutrophils and neutropenia, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) also occur with septic shock unaccompanied by intestinal inflammation. 115 Although sepsis and SIRS are complications of NEC it is important to exclude NEC as the underlying cause of sepsis. The following two findings, if present, favor the diagnosis of NEC:\n\n\u2022 New onset hyponatremia (<130 mEq/L) that cannot be explained by dilution or by treatment with diuretics. Generally, this finding appears early before significant clinical illness develops.\n\n\u2022 Hematochezia (blood in the stool, not occult blood) that may appear early in the disease process or later after resolution of ileus.\n\nThe differential diagnosis also includes other causes of anatomic and functional intestinal obstruction (e.g., malrotation, intestinal atresia, intussusceptions, aganglionosis); conditions that can result in intestinal ischemia (e.g., volvulus, critical coarctation of the aorta, hypoplastic left heart syndrome; omphalitis; and milk protein intolerance. 8, 9, 106 \n\nThe overall mortality rate in NEC is between 20-40% but varies with the severity and extent of gut-necrosis. [130] [131] [132] Mortality is inversely related to PMA at birth. 6, 15 Other complications of NEC include intestinal stricture(s), enterocutaneous fistula, intraabdominal abscess, cholestasis, and short-bowel syndrome. 7, 131, 132 Intestinal and liver failure can also occur that require transplantation. Strictures typically occur 3 to 8 weeks after the acute episode but can also present several months later. 98 Contrast enema is indicated if signs of subacute intestinal obstruction appear several weeks after the acute episode of NEC. The colon is the most common site for stricture development, but strictures can also occur in the ileum or jeujenum. 98, 99 Diffuse pneumatosis increases the risk for strictures. 98, 99 Risks of all co-morbidities of prematurity increase with NEC including neurodevelopmental, motor, sensory, and cognitive problems.

These methods use noninvasive indicators such as profiling of the fecal microbiome, 55 and identification of the expression of inflammatory proteins from buccal epithelium using buccal swab collection. 136 Determination of oxidative stress (OS) by measuring concentrations of nonprotein bound iron (NPBI), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), and total hydroxides (TH) in cord blood has been reported to be useful in predicting which VP infants are at risk for NEC-but requires additional validation. 137\n\nEarlier non-invasive diagnosis of NEC through use of abdominal sonography in infants with non-specific clinical and radiographic signs and through assessment of metabolic derangement may result in more timely and appropriate medical treatment and surgical intervention. 108, 113 However, no studies have demonstrated improved clinical outcomes due to facilitated diagnosis and management. Future trials comparing outcomes of peritoneal drainage with laparotomy should include distinguishing NEC from IIP. 101\n\nClinical studies suggest that the isolated perforation occurs when the intestinal mucosa has been weakened by processes such as local ischemia-reperfusion or thromboembolism.\n\nConversely, NEC involves both infectious and inflammatory mechanisms. 138 Designing strategies to prevent the occurrence of NEC and to improve outcomes of infants who develop NEC should consider these diagnoses as fundamentally different disease processes.\n\nThe focus of NEC research is shifting from concentrating on the distinct nature of this disease to understanding the unique characteristics of the immune-na\u00efve premature patient. Hence, investigative and interventional techniques aimed at ensuring a more appropriate and mature intestinal immune response should be tested as preventative strategies. Scheme illustrating pathophysiology of NEC. Microbial components such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS), lipoteichoic acid (LTA), formylated peptides, and flagellin serve as microbial-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) and signal pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including toll-like receptors (TLRs), formylated peptide receptors (FPRs), or nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NODs). Integration of these signals evokes cellular outputs based on the initial perception of the triggering organism. Output can be a protective response to commensal microbiota, an inflammatory response to pathogenic organism(s), or it can trigger apoptosis. (Adapted from: 35 A. Probability by postmenstrual age (PMA) at birth that an infant with NEC will present with intramural gas (IMG) or portal venous gas (PVG). There is less than 50% probability for an extremely (EP) infant to manifest IMG. B. Radiographic signs that are more probable in infants with decreasing PMA. There is more than 50% probability that an EP infant will present with these signs. (Adapted and modified from: 7 A. There is extensive pneumatosis (arrows); left upper arrow pointing at gastric pneumatosis. Pneumatosis is seen as multiple curvilinear radiolucencies in this plain radiograph.

Portal venous gas (arrows) is seen as lucencies in on CT scan. A. Histology of small bowel (\u00d7100 magnification) illustrating rounded large bubbles (arrows) of pneumatosis (intramural gas) in the submucosa. B. At a more advanced stage, there is necrosis of mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis with intraluminal necrotic debris on the mucosal side (m). Only the serosa (s) appears intact. C. Gross pathology at post mortem examination shows severe NEC. Arrows indicate severe sloughing of mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis mucosa. Only a thin layer of serosa is intact allowing the intestinal lumen to be seen (Adapted from: 108 "}
