{"title": "Identification of a Novel Base J Binding Protein Complex Involved in 2 RNA Polymerase II Transcription Termination in Trypanosomes 3 Short Title: PNUTS-PP1 Regulates Transcription Termination in T", "body": "240 Subsequently, the TEV protease eluate underwent anti-Protein C affinity purification, and the final purified 241 products were eluted with EGTA. The concentrated proteins were then trypsin-digested and analyzed by 242 LC-MS/MS. As a control, we analyzed the eluate of a comparable purification of extract from wild-type T. 243 brucei. As expected, TbPNUTS was identified along with Wdr82 and JBP3 (Table 2) \n\nTo further characterize the PNUTS complex, extracts recovered from T. brucei cells expressing 279 epitope-tagged components were analyzed by western blot following sucrose fractionation. Analysis of T.\n\n280 brucei cells expressing PTP-PNUTS and HA-JBP3 or HA-Wdr82 indicate Wdr82, JBP3 and PNUTS co-281 migrate at <200kDa. These results indicate that JBP3, Wdr82 and PNUTS form a stable complex of 282 <200kDa. Summation of the predicted size of the three complex components (~180 kDa) agrees with the 283 observed mass of the PJW complex and suggests a 1:1 stoichiometry for the subunits. Taken together, 284 data from co-immunoprecipitation, sucrose gradient analysis, and identification of PNUTS-, Wdr82-, and 285 JBP3-associated proteins by mass spectrometry indicate that Wdr82, JBP3 and PNUTS comprise a 286 stable PJW complex in kinetoplastids ( Fig 1F) . In contrast to the complex in Leishmania, the stable 287 purified T. brucei complex lacks both JGT and PP1.\n\nLtPP1 is found to be stably associated in PJW/PP1 complex, possibly through its putative PP1-289 interacting protein, PNUTS. PNUTS is present in both the T. brucei and Leishmania complex and share a 290 conserved RVxF motif ( Fig 1C) . Moreover, a similar human PTW/PP1 complex suggests that PP1 confers 291 the complex phosphatase activity critical for its regulation in Pol II termination (2, 3, 53, 54). The apparent 292 lack of PP1 in the T. brucei complex is therefore surprising. To identify the TbPP1 component, we directly 293 tested two of the eight PP1 genes in T. brucei for interactions with the complex by co-IP. PP1-1 has the 294 highest sequence homology to the PP1 involved in termination in yeast and humans (51). PP1-7 has .

However, neither of these PP1 proteins associate with 296 TbPNUTS in the co-IP (S3C Fig). Alternatively, PP1 is not stably associated with the complex in T. brucei.\n\n297 This is consistent with one of three replicates of LtJGT purification that resulted in all components of the 298 complex except PP1 (S1 Table) , suggesting PP1 is the least stable component of the Leishmania 299 complex. It has been demonstrated that the phosphorylation of Ser residue(s) within or close to the RVxF 300 motif of PP1 regulatory subunits, including PNUTS, disrupts the binding of this motif to PP1 (56-59).

We also detect evidence of read-through transcription at the 327 representative PTU internal termination site on chromosome 5 upon ablation of the three factors. RT-PCR 328 using oligos flanking the termination site (see diagram, Fig 3A) detects increased RNA upon ablation of 329 PNUTS, Wdr82 and JBP3 ( Fig 3C) . As a control a separate RT-PCR utilized the same 5' primer and a 3' 330 primer immediately upstream of the termination site. We have previously shown that an RNA species 331 spanning the termination site is indicative of read-through transcription and is only detected following the 332 loss of base J or H3.V, due to continued transcription elongation at termination sites (21, 24, 25).\n\n333 Consistent with read-through transcription, both genes downstream of the termination site are significantly 334 de-repressed upon the ablation of the three components of the PJW/PP1 complex, in contrast to genes 335 upstream ( Fig 3D) . In contrast, no significant termination defects are detected upon ablation of a negative 336 control, acidocalcisome VA a protein (Fig 3 C and D) . VA a has been shown to be an essential gene in T.\n\n337 brucei and ablation results in similar growth defects as seen in PJW/PP1 complex (60) (Fig 3B) . Table) . 364 The location of the genes with >3-fold upregulation was mapped (Fig 4A and S5 ). Interestingly, these 365 genes were closely located at regions flanking PTUs or subtelomeric regions, suggesting a role of 366 PNUTS in genome-wide transcription, specifically at transcription initiation and termination sites, as well 367 as subtelomeres. The PTU flanking regions represent transcription termination sites (TTS) and 368 transcription start sites (TSS) within the so-called convergent strand switch region (cSSR) and divergent 369 strand switch region (dSSR), respectively. We have previously shown that base J is localized within the 370 cSSRs and dSSRs flanking PTUs and involved in Pol II termination. Therefore, we wanted to first confirm 371 the association with J at termination sites with changes in gene expression we observed in the PNUTS The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

To take a 409 closer look at the increased level of transcripts at these sites, and determine whether they are due to 410 transcriptional readthrough, forward and reverse reads mapping to 5kb flanking and within cSSRs were 411 counted and RPKM values were generated. As shown in Fig 4B, \n\nBased on the initial RT-PCR analysis of the internal termination site in PNUTS, JBP3 and Wdr82 424 knockdowns (Fig 3) , we expected RNA-seq to illustrate defects in termination at 3'-end of PTUs genome-425 wide in the PNUTS mutant. However, we also detected accumulation of transcripts at dSSRs, illustrated 426 by the genome-wide map of transcript levels (S6 Fig) and the metaplot of dSSRs (Fig 4C and S7 Fig) . At 427 these divergent TSSs, the region upstream of the start site produced more transcripts in the PNUTS 428 mutant when forward and reverse reads were analyzed separately, indicating that transcription initiates 429 upstream of its start site upon the loss of PNUTS. In some cases, this leads to expression of genes 430 present in the dSSR that are silent in WT cells. This explains the mapping of genes upregulated in the 431 PNUTS mutant to 5'-end PTUs (Fig 4A) .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/753004 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nIn addition to Pol II termination sites distributed throughout the T. brucei genome, H3.V and base 519 J localize within the ~14 Pol I transcribed polycistronic units located at the telomeric ends and involved in 520 antigenic variation (so called bloodstream form VSG expression sites, BESs) ( Fig 6A)(19, 75-77 ).\n\n521 Monoallelic expression of a VSG ES leads to the expression of a single VSG on the surface of the 522 parasite, a key aspect of the strategy bloodstream form trypanosomes use to evade the host immune 523 system. We have previously shown that the loss of H3.V and J leads to increased expression of VSG 524 genes from silent telomeric BESs (21). This effect is presumably due to the role of these epigenetic marks 525 in attenuating transcription elongation Pol I within the silent VSG BESs, thereby preventing the 526 transcription of silent VSGs. Differential gene expression analysis of RNA-seq reads mapped to the 427 527 genome indicates that the loss of PNUTS leads to increased VSG expression from silent BESs (S2 Table) . Table and S5 Fig). In the VSGnome, these (unknown) VSGs ( Fig 6B) were thought to 542 be primarily located at subtelomeric arrays, but their exact positioning in the genome was not known (78). \n\nThe derepression of ESAG 6 and 7 genes adjacent to the BES promoter along with the VSG ~40 566 kb downstream (S2 Table) , suggests that PJW/PP1 may function throughout the telomeric PTU. To 567 examine this more closely, we analyzed the RNA-seq reads mapping to the 14 telomeric BES sequences 568 (80). RNA-seq reads mapping to BES were counted in 200bp windows with a 100bp steps. Read counts 569 were converted into reads per million (RPM) and compared between +/-Tet to estimate log2 fold change 570 and plotted in Fig 7C and S11 Fig. The location of BES promoters is indicated by an arrow. The 571 transcription of the active BES1 was not affected by the loss of TbPNUTS. However, when the remaining 572 13 silent BESs are analyzed we see derepression of ESAGs as well as the terminal VSG. In some cases, 573 it seems that derepression extends 10-20 kb from the promoter to express ESAG 6 and 7, with no .

In other cases there is selective upregulation of the VSG gene, including the pseudo VSGs 576 that are present upstream of some telomeric VSGs. The apparent selective VSG upregulation may be 577 due to the combined effect of low level transcription of the entire BES and enhanced stability of VSG 578 mRNAs. For example, the increased VSG mRNA half-life (4.5 hrs) compared with ESAG 6 and 7 (1.8-2.8 579 hrs) (81, 82). Transcripts of genes located approximately 5 kb upstream of the VSG have also been 580 shown to be selectively rapidly degraded, presumably by nonsense-mediated decay (83). We also 581 noticed that increased levels of RNA close to the promoter are significantly higher when there is an 582 additional BES promoter upstream for ESAG10. In fact, the most significant gene expression changes are 583 in BESs that have dual promoters (S2 Table) . These data would suggest derepression of telomere-584 proximal VSG genes after PNUTS depletion is due to transcriptional activation of silent Pol I promoters. 585 However, these results are also consistent with increased Pol I elongation along the BES. Repression of 586 silent ESs is mediated at least in part by the inhibition of Pol I elongation within the BES preventing the 587 production of VSG mRNA from the silent BESs (84-86). Similar to its inhibition of Pol II transcription 588 elongation at termination sites at the 5' and 3' end of PTUs genome-wide, PNUTS may also function at 589 telomeric regions to attenuate Pol I transcription elongation within the silent ESs. The data here suggest 590 PJW/PP1 controls VSG silencing at BESs by regulating Pol I elongation (termination) and/or regulating 591 access of the polymerase to silent promoter regions.\n\nDiscussion 594 841 carbamidomethylation on cysteine residues and a variable modification of oxidation on methionine 842 residues were enabled to accurately match fragment ions. A fixed value peptide spectral match (PSM) 843 validation node was used to validate each PSM at a maximum delta Cn of 0.05. All PSMs were subjected 844 to further validation with a maximum of 1% false discovery rate utilizing PSMs matched to a reverse 845 (decoy) database while being assigned to protein groups. The L. tarentolae JBP3 gene was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR with primers containing 5' 860 Nde I and 3' BamH I restriction sites. PCR fragments were digested with Nde I and BamH I and 861 subcloned into the pet16b expression vector. Plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli (BL21 862 DE3), and bacteria were cultured in defined autoinduction media to allow growing cultures to high 863 densities and protein expression without induction, as previously described (121). Briefly, LB media is 864 supplemented with KH 2 PO 4 , Na 2 HPO 4 and 0.05% Glucose, 0.2% Lactose and 0.6% Glycerol. Bacteria 865 were cultured in this media in the presence of 100\uf06dg/ml ampicillin at 37 O C for 2 h and then shifted to 866 18 O C for 24 h. Cells were lysed and JBP3 purified by metal affinity as previously described for JBP1 (37, .
