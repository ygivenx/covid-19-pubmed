{"title": "No Evidence of Goul\u00e9ako and Herbert Virus Infections in Pigs, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana Technical Appendix Additional Methods and Results", "body": "Ethical review and clearances of animal handling procedure were obtained from the Ghana Forestry Commission of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture. RNA was extracted from 15\u00b5L of porcine serum samples mixed with 55\u00b5L Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline by using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Random cDNA synthesis was performed by using SuperScript III (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Lithuania). Viral genome copies were measured by real-time reverse-transcription PCR, as described previously (1, 2) . The Technical Appendix Table shows samples tested and results.\n\nPorcine serum samples were screened for presence of antibodies against the GOLV and HEBV viruses in 1:20 dilutions by rIFA as described (3). C-terminally FLAG-tagged full nucleocapsid genes of GOLV or HEBV were amplified from cDNA by using the primers "}
