{"title": "Functions of Alphavirus Nonstructural Proteins in RNA Replication", "body": "A1phaviruses are enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses transmitted to vertebrate hosts by mosquitoes. Several alphaviruses are pathogenic to humans or domestic animals, causing serious central nervous system infections or milder infections with, e.g., arthritis, rash, and fever (1) . The structure and replication of Serrdiki Forest virus (SFV) and Sindbis virus ( cleaved to yield nonstructural protein 4 (nsP4) and P123 (Fig. 1) . This is the \"early RNA polymerase\" responsible for the synthesis of full-size complementary RNA (42S RNA minus strand). After further cleavage of P123 into nsP1, nsP2, and nsP3, the minus strand in turn is used as template for the synthesis of new 42S RNA plus strands, as well as subgenomic 26S mRNA of the structural proteins.\n\nThe 26S RNA of SFV, which corresponds to the 3' third of 42S RNA, is translated to structural polyprotein of 1250 aa consisting of capsid protein, E3, E2, 6K, and E1 proteins (Fig. 1) . Translation of 26S RNA starts on free ribosomes, but nascent autocatalytic cleavage of the capsid protein releases the signal peptide at the N terminus of E3, which guides the ribosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The capsid protein associates transiently with the 60S subunit of the translating ribosome, and is then transferred to the 42S RNA genome during the assembly of the nucleocapsid (10) . The assembly of the nucleocapsid is poorly understood, but RNA-protein interactions probably play an important role (11) (12) (13) . E3 plus E2 are translocated as a precursor protein p62, which is co-translationally glycosylated. E1 is preceded by a hydrophobic 6K protein, the N terminus of which serves as a signal peptide. The cellular K~,~RIAINEN AND AHOLA signal peptidase cleaves between p62 and 6K, and between 6K and El. The E1 and p62, which acquire N-linked complex glycans (14, 15) , are transported via the Golgi complex to the plasma membrane, p62 is cleaved into E3 and E2 by a furin-like protease during transport from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane. In SIN-infected cells, E3 is secreted to the medium, whereas SFV E3 remains associated with the El-E2 heterodimer and is incorporated into virions during their budding at the plasma membrane.\n\nPositive-strand RNA viruses can be divided into large groups termed superfamilies, the members of which share common features in their encoded replicase proteins, genome organization, and replication strategies. Thus, the superfamily concept is biologically useful, although superfamilies have no officially recognized taxonomic status. A comprehensive analysis of RNA virus sequences suggests that the superfamilies might be as few as three in number, i.e., the picornavirus-like, alphavirus-like, and flavivirus-like viruses (16) , although it could be argued that the coronavirus-like viruses and positive-strand RNA bacteriophages could also be placed in their own groups. A striking feature of the superfamilies is that although the replicase proteins share sequence similarity, and therefore a common descendent within the superfamily, the viruses may exhibit widely variable structures (nonenveloped and enveloped) and infect different kinds of hosts (plants and animals). Even within the superfamilies, the replicase proteins often show rearrangements and acquisition or deletion of domains.\n\nMembers of the alphavirus-like superfamily of positive-strand RNA viruses include the animal viruses of genus Alphavirus, and Rubella virus (comprising family Togaviridae) and Hepatitis E virus, as well as the insect viruses of Tetraviridae family, and numerous groups of plant viruses, including Brorru)viridae, Closteroviridae, and the genera Tobamo-, Tobra-, Hordei-, Furo-, Beny-, CapiUo-, Tymo-, Carla-, and Potexvirus, and other plant virus groups. The genome organization of three superfamily members is illustrated in Fig. 2 to highlight some of the similarities and differences. The replicase proteins always feature three conserved domains (16) , an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase module, a conserved helicase-like domain of helicase superfamily SF1, and a module termed methyltransferase, or more recently capping enzyme. The presence of the methyltransferase/capping enzyme is the distinguishing hallmark of the alphavirus-like superfamily, as it is always present in superfamily members, and on the other hand, its relationship to other viral or cellular polypeptides is exceedingly distant (17, 18) . The are encoded by the same RNA), although they may be separated by other domains or be finally present in separate polypeptides as a result of proteolytic processing.\n\nOther similarities shared by members of the alphavirus superfamily include (i) membrane-associated replication, (ii) presence of cap0 structure at the 5' end of positive-strand mRNAs, (iii) an extra untemplated G residue at the 3' end of minus strand, (iv) asymmetry of replication producing an excess of plusstrand RNA, (v) shut-off of minus-strand RNA synthesis late in infection, and (vi) regulated production of subgenomic mRNA molecules by internal initiation. In many other respects the viruses can be highly dissimilar. For instance, the genome can either consist of a single RNA or be segmented. It can end in a poly(A) or a tRNA-like structure, and the nonstructural proteins may or may not be subject to proteolytic processing (19) .\n\nThe pairwise sequence identity of, for instance, SFV and BMV methyltransferase, helicase, and polymerase domains at the amino acid level is only 15-18%. As the remaining sequence similarity of even the conserved portions of the replicase is so low, it would be surprising if they had not adapted in many ways to different functions during the evolution of different lineages within the superfamily. Nevertheless, the basic replication complex with the conserved capping enzyme, helicase and polymerase domains is likely to be similar throughout the alphavirus-like superfamily, as all viruses have to perform a closely similar set of coordinated reactions. These similarities, when experimentally discovered and proven, will validate the virus superfamily concept. We hope that the information presented here on alphaviruses will prove useful and stimulating for investigators working on other virus groups.\n\nICi~RIAINEN AND AHOLA\n\nEarly work with SFV and SIN identified in infected cells two major singlestranded RNAs sedimenting in sucrose gradients at 42S (49S in SIN) and 26S (20) (21) (22) . In addition, there is a heterogenous, partly double-stranded replicative intermediate (RI) RNA sedimenting between 20S and 29S. When this heterogenous material is isolated and subjected to RNase treatment, double-stranded RNAs arise. The replicative form RFI consists of a complete duplex of full-size plus and minus strands, whereas RFIII represents 26S RNA plus strand together with a respective portion of minus strand. RFII is a double-stranded form of the 5' two-thirds of the genome. After short pulses with tritiated uridine, label is found in RFI and RFIII, whereas labeling of RFII takes a much longer time. These results lead to the deduction that the genome RNA is synthesized via a replicative intermediate RIa, which after ribonuclease treatment yields RFI, whereas another structure Rib is involved in the synthesis of the subgenomic 26S RNA. RNase treatment of Rib yields both RFII and RFIII. The slow labeling of RFII was interpreted to mean a slow interconversion between RIa and Rib, i.e., between synthesis of genomic and subgenomic RNAs (23, 24) ( Fig. 3) .\n\nNumerous studies have shown that virus-specific RNA polymerase activity is associated with cytoplasmic membranes together with heterogenous RNA (25) (26) (27) . The role of 26S RNA as messenger for the structural proteins was finally proven by its in vitro translation in the presence of ER membranes, which yields all structural proteins (28) . The role of the 42S RNA genome as the messenger for nonstructural proteins of SFV has been established (29-31) and confirmed by determination of the complete nucleotide sequence of SFV (32) and SIN (33) .\n\nThe genomes of alphaviruses have four conserved sequence motifs, two at the 5' end within the first about 200 nucleotides, one of about an 20-nt-long motif at the 3' end preceding the poly(A) sequence, and one of about 20 nt, which in minus-strand RNA serves as the promoter for the synthesis of 26S RNA (34) . In addition, the genome has a recognition signal for its incorporation into nucleocapsid particles, the so-called encapsidation signal. In SIN RNA it is located in the coding region of nsP1 (35) ; and in SFV, in the region coding for nsP2 (36) . The conserved 5' and 3' end sequences plus the encapsidation sequences have been regularly found in defective-interfering RNAs (DI-RNAs) of alphaviruses, although often in rearranged order (37) (38) (39) (40) . The extreme 5' end of some DI-RNAs differs from that of the genome RNA (41, 42) . This suggests that the conserved sequences downstream of the extreme 5' terminus act as the RNA replication signals (43, 44) (Fig. 3 ). ICd~RIJLINEN AND AHOLA Synthesis of SFV and SIN 42S RNA minus strands takes place within the first hours of infection. At 37-40\u00b0C, minus-strand RNA synthesis is maximal around 2.5-3 h and is shut off approximately 4 h after infection. At 28\u00b0C, the shut-off takes place about 6 h after infection. Minus-strand RNA synthesis is accompanied by synthesis of plus strands at a ratio of about I to 5. The synthesis of minus-strand RNA is strictly dependent on protein synthesis and ceases within 15 min after addition of, e.g., cycloheximide, unlike the synthesis of RNA plus strands (45) . Thus, continuous protein synthesis is required to produce the \"minus-strand RNA polymerase.\" The virus specificity of this early polymerase has been confirmed by analyzing temperature-sensitive virus mutants. An RNAnegative SIN mutant, tsll, is defective only in minus-strand RNA synthesis, when infected cultures are shifted from the permissive (28\u00b0C) to the restrictive (39\u00b0C) temperature. The defect of ts11 is due to one amino acid replacement Ala348Thr in nsP1 (46) , indicating that nsP1 is specifically involved in the regulation of minus-strand RNA synthesis (47, 48) . Another SIN mutant, ts4, with an amino acid change Ala268Val in the nsP3 protein, is also defective in minusstrand synthesis (49) .\n\nAn explanation for the short half-life of minus-strand RNA synthesis was generated by a series of studies on the processing intermediates of SIN nonstructural polyprotein (see Section V). Expression of recombinant vaccinia virus constructions, encoding various uncleavable polyproteins, showed that minusstrand RNA synthesis requires uncleaved P123, together with correctly cleaved nsP4 (50-54) (Fig. 3A) . Processing of P123 into nsP1, nsP2, and nsP3 stops minus-strand RNA synthesis and enables their use as templates for synthesis of plus strands. Late in infection, new replication complexes cannot be assembled, as nsP2 protease rapidly cleaves P1234 through an alternative pathway first producing P12 and P34.\n\nHowever, a number of alphavirus ts mutants have been characterized, which can reactivate minus-strand RNA synthesis after it has been shut off. The reactivation takes place in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors (55) (56) (57) (58) .\n\nMany of the mutations have been mapped to the carboxy-terminal half of nsP2 (59) ; and one mutation, to nsP4 (57) . Studies of the reactivation have suggested specific interactions between nsP1 and nsP4 (48) as well as between nsP2 and nsP4 (58). The mechanism of this puzzling phenomenon is still unknown, but it implies that in these mutants the late RNA polymerase, in which all proteolytic cleavages have taken place, can rearrange into the conformation of the early RNA polymerase after a temperature shift from 28 to 39\u00b0C. Thus, the structural differences between the two functions of the RNA polymerase must be small.\n\nQuantitation by [S2P]orthophosphate equilibrium labeling has shown that about 200,000 molecules of both 42S and 26S RNAs have been synthesized at 8 h after infection in an SFV-infected BHK21 cell (60) . As the number of minus strands has been estimated by dot-blotting to be approximately 5000 (48) , RNA replication as a whole is highly asymmetric. The rate of 42S and 26S RNA synthesis is almost linear between 4 and 8 h after infection and is not affected by inhibition of protein synthesis (61) , indicating that stable RNA replication complexes are continuously producing the plus-strand RNAs in replicative intermediates RIa and Rib. Interestingly, plus-strand RNA synthesis is not increased in mutant-infected cells, in which minus-strand RNA synthesis is not shut off (56) . Neither is RNA synthesis affected by overproduction of viral nonstructural proteins (62) .\n\nThe site of late RNA synthesis has been localized to alphavirus-specific structures, designated cytoplasmic vacuoles (CPVs) (63) (64) (65) (66) . Their diameter varies from 0.2 to 1/zm, and their surface consists of small invaginations, or spherules, with a diameter of about 50 nm (Fig. 4) . The four nonstructural proteins as well as nascent RNA molecules are associated with CPVs and more closely associated with the spherules (66) . The time of appearance of CPVs depends on the amount of infecting virus. With 10-20 plaque-forming units per cell, they first appear 3 h after infection, and their number starts to decline at 6 h. Addition of cycloheximide at 2 h after infection reduces the number of CPVIs, whereas addition after 4 h has no effect (67) . This time scale coincides with the cessation of minus-strand RNA synthesis (45) and the cessation of the synthesis of nsPs 68) , suggesting that CPVs arise through the action ofnsPs like the minus-strand RNA. Later in infection, the synthesis of plus strands continues in association with stable CPVs using the previously synthesized minus strands as templates. CPVs stain for endosomal and lysosomal markers, indicating that they are modified endosomes and lysosomes (64) (65) (66) . Similar structures have been described in rubella virus-infected cells (69, 70) .\n\nCytoplasmic membrane fractions, from SFV-and SIN-infected cells sedimenting at 15,000g contain essentially all virus-specific RNA polymerase activity of the cell (26, 71) . The polymerase activity is associated with a smooth membrane fraction (27, 71, 72) , which synthesises 42S and 26S RNAs and replicative intermediate RNAs. Attempts to isolate template-free RNA polymerase have so far failed. Expression of P123 plus nsP4 yields membrane fractions, which can support double-stranded RNA synthesis after addition of suitable positive-sense template RNAs containing the conserved 51 and 3' sequences of the genuine RNA (54).\n\nAt a time when the function of 26S RNA was not known, evidence accumulated that its synthesis was not coupled with the synthesis of 42S RNA. Puromycin, given early in SIN infection, inhibits only 26S RNA production (45, 73) . RNA-negative ts mutants of SFV and SIN, which are unable to replicate at 39\u00b0C, have been isolated and characterized (74) (75) (76) (77) . With some of the mutants, the synthesis of only 26S RNA stops after shift to the restrictive temperature. One particular SFV mutant, ts4, turned out to be interesting in this respect. When ts4-infected cells were incubated at 28\u00b0C for 6 h to start the RNA synthesis, followed by a shift to 39\u00b0C in the presence of cycloheximide, the synthesis of 26S RNA was specifically shut off. However, it was resumed, once the cultures were shifted back to 28\u00b0C. The reversal was independent of protein synthesis (78) . Careful analysis of the labeled RIs and double-stranded RNAs from ts4-infected cells revealed a reversible shift of Rib to RIa. This leads us to suggest that a virus-specific protein regulates the initiation of 26S RNA synthesis by binding reversibly to a promoter on the minus-strand RNA within the replicative intermediate Rib (79) (Fig. 3D and 3E) . SFV ts4 has a single-amino acid replacement Met781Thr in nsP2. Reversible cross-linking experiments suggested that an increased amount of nsP2 was associated with the other nsPs at 28\u00b0C as compared to 39\u00b0C (59) . All SIN ts mutants with a defect in 26S RNA synthesis have been mapped to the C-terminal half on nsP2 (46, 59) .\n\nHowever, direct proof that nsP2 interacts with the 26S RNA promoter is still lacking.\n\nThe subgenomic RNA promoter in the 42S minus strand has been carefully mapped for SIN RNA (80) . The minimal region is 19 nucleotides upstream and 5 nucleotides downstream of the initiation site of 26S RNA transcription.\n\nHowever, a larger region containing nucleotides -98 to +14 is required for optimal transcription (81) . More detailed mapping revealed that optimal transcription could be obtained with sequences -40 to -20 and +6 to + 14 together with the core promoter (82).\n\nShort-lived processing intermediates P123, P12, and P34 have been identified as precursors for the four nonstructural proteins, later designated nsPl-nsP4 (2, 83~5) ( Fig. 1) . Proteins of similar size were also identified in SIN-infected cells (76, 86) . Sequencing of the SIN (33) and SFV (32) genome RNAs revealed differences in the translation strategies of the nonstructural proteins. In SFVinfected cells, the entire nonstructural region coding for 2432 aa is translated as polyprotein P1234. In the SIN genome, there is an opal termination codon close to the carboxy terminus of nsP3. This is occasionally suppressed, giving rise to P1234 (2513 aa). Thus, in SIN-infected cells, an excess of P123 is produced, and nsP4 can only be produced by processing of P1234 (34) . In vitro translation of SIN genome RNA has been used to study the processing of P123 and P1234, produced from an RNA where the opal codon was mutated to a codon for cysteine. Both P123 and P1234 are processed in vitro autocatalytically due to protease activity of nsP2 (87) (88) (89) (90) . This complex process was approached by using constructions in which the cleavage sites were mutated either alone or in combination with substrates in which the protease activity had been eliminated (34, 89) . The experiments resulted in cleavage \"rules\": (i) P1234 can cleave autocatalytically to produce P123 and nsP4; (ii) P123 cannot cleave in cis but can be cleaved only in a bimolecular reaction; (iii) P12 can slowly cleave autoproteolytically to nsP1 and nsP2; (iv) all three sites can be cleaved in trans (34, 91) . However, the most important result from this work was the possibility to express stable precursor proteins, which revealed the nature of the \"early RNA polymerase\" (P123 plus nsP4) (52, 53) .\n\nMany of these experiments have been repeated with SFV nonstructural polyproteins translated in vitro. The polyproteins were also expressed alone and in combinations in insect cells using baculovirus vectors. Coexpression of protease P23 with proteolytically defective P1234 or P123 yields P12 in addition to nsP3 from P123 and nsP3 and nsP4 from P1234. Expression of P12 or P23 in insect cells and in vitro resulted in their cleavage to nsP1 and nsP2 and to nsP2 and nsP3, respectively. All attempts to cleave proteolytically defective P12 or P123 in trans, using, e.g., P123 as the protease, have failed. P34 and P1234 yielded regularly nsP4 by P23 protease, indicating that cleavage at the 3/4 site takes place in trans (92; Merits et al., unpublished results). K,~ikRIAINEN AND AHOLA\n\nIn recent years, nsP1 has been one of the main objects of our studies. We have discovered a novel kind of coupled methyltransferase and guanylyltransferase activity needed in the capping of virus-specific mRNA molecules and conserved in the alphavirus-like superfamily. On the other hand, we have studied the membrane interaction of nsP1, which is mediated by covalent palmitoylation and by direct interaction of the polypeptide chain with anionic membrane lipids (Fig. 5 ). Genetic evidence obtained by us and others indicates that nsP1 is involved in the synthesis of minus-strand RNAs.\n\nNsP1 is a guanine-7-methyltransferase transferring a methyl group from S-adenosyl-methionine (AdoMet) to GTP (93, 94) , and it forms a covalent complex with 7-methyl-GMP (mTGMP) in a guanylyltransferase-like reaction (95) .\n\nThese results indicate that nsP1 is an enzyme acting in the formation of mTGpppA cap structures on virus-specific genomic and subgenomic mRNAs. The substrate specificity of nsP1 differs from cellular RNA-capping enzymes. In the methyltransferase reaction, nsP1 prefers GTP (and dGTP) as methyl-accepting substrates, whereas cellular enzymes methylate cap analogs and unmethylated guanosine-capped RNAs (94, 96) (Fig. 6 ). In the guanylyltransferase reaction, step taking place on the RNA molecule (for reviews, see Refs. 97 and 98). In both patways, these reactions are preceded by RNA 5' triphosphatase, which removes the 5' gamma phosphate of the nascent RNA. In alphaviruses, nsP2 has RNA triphosphatase activity (see Section VII,B).\n\nNsPl-related proteins encoded by members of the alphavirus-like superfamily catalyze similar virus-specific RNA-capping reactions. Methyltransferase activity and covalent complex formation exclusively with m7GMP have been demonstrated for TMV p126 (99), BMV la (100, 101) , and the N-terminal fragments of bamboo mosaic potexvirus (102) and HEV replicase proteins (103) .\n\nThus, all members of the alphavirus-like superfamily are likely to share a similar conserved RNA-capping activity. Since it differs from cellular RNA capping, it offers a target for virus-specific inhibitors of RNA replication. So far, it has been shown that some cap analogs can inhibit SFV nsP1 and HEV-capping enzyme (96, 103) . Importantly, in this respect, it has been demonstrated by mutational analysis that the capping enzyme activities are essential for alphavirus and BMV replication (104, 105) . In a BMV replication system in yeast cells, it was possible to directly demonstrate the role of la protein in viral RNA capping in vivo, as mutation of the host exonuclease XRN1 permitted replication and thus the study of uncapped viral RNAs (105) .\n\nSome mechanistic details of the reactions catalyzed by nsP1 and related proteins have been studied. The guanylyltransferase reaction absolutely requires 200 KA~RIAINEN AND AHOLA divalent cations (Mg z+ or Mn2+), whereas the methyltransferase reaction of at least some family members can proceed in the presence of EDTA (94, 95, 100, 103) . For BMV la, it has been directly demonstrated by NMR spectroscopy analysis of reaction products that methylation takes place only on the 7-position of guanylate (100) , which is in keeping with the fact that alphavirus-like viral mRNAs are capped with cap0 structure mTGpppN lacking further methyl groups. Although nsP 1 exclusively forms a covalent complex with mTGMP, it cannot accept mTGTP directly as a substrate for complex formation. Instead, GTP and AdoMet are required, indicating that methylation and covalent complex formation are normally coupled (18) . dGTP is a good substrate for methylation by both nsP1 and BMV la, but yet these enzymes preferentially form a covalent complex with mVGMP, as compared to mTdGMP, indicating that further selection takes place at the guanylyltransfer step (95, 100, 101) . BMV la with a covalently bound guanylate appears to be inhibited in further methyltransferase reactions (100) . SFV nsP1 has to be associated with anionic phospholipids in order to be active in the capping reactions (106; see below). This feature may not be shared among all members of the alphavirus-like superfamily (103).\n\nAs indicated above, the RNA-capping pathway is conserved within the alphavirus-like superfamily, and the methyltransferase and guanylyltransferase activities are associated with the conserved methyltransferase/capping enzyme domain, which is the hallmark of the alphavirus-like superfamily. It was initially thought that this domain would bear no resemblance to any cellular proteins (17) . Only when the structures of several cellular methyltransferases became available, it was demonstrated that the predicted secondary structure of a portion of nsP1 and related viral proteins was similar to known methyltransferase structures (18) . It was also shown by cross-linking that two conserved residues Asp64 and Asp90 in two adjacent loops of SFV nsP1, which correspond to the AdoMet-binding region of structurally studied methyltransferases, are needed for AdoMet binding and methyltransferase activity (18, 100) . The same region is implicated in AdoMet binding by a double-mutation Arg87Leu and Ser88Cys in SIN nsP1, which enables virus growth in methionine-deprived cells and lowers the KM of the methyltransferase for AdoMet (107, 108) . Together, these results strongly suggest that nsPl-related proteins structurally resemble methyltransferases and pinpoint the AdoMet-binding site (Fig. 5) .\n\nIn contrast, it is less clear where the methyl-accepting GTP substrate binds, as mutations in conserved residues do not abrogate GTP cross-linking to the protein (18) . However, a SIN mutant resistant to mycophenolic acid and ribavirin, compounds which lower intracellular GTP concentration by inhibiting inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, appears highly interesting in this respect (109) . An nsP1 double-mutation Ser23Asn and Val302Met is required for resistance (110, 111) , which may indicate that these two regions of the protein ALPHAVIRUS NONSTRUCTURAL PROTEINS 201 flanking the conserved methyltransferase domain may come together in the three-dimensional structure to form the GTP-binding site.\n\nNsP1 does not seem to have any similarity to the cellular guanylyltransferase family of proteins (18) . In cellular enzymes, a conserved lysine residue forms the covalent linkage with GMP. There are no conserved lysines in nsPl-like proteins, although the properties of the covalent linkage resemble that ofa phosphoamidetype bond (95) . Instead, an absolutely conserved histidine (His38 in SFV nsP1) is a good candidate for covalent binding of m7GMP, in that mutations of this residue permit retention of methyltransferase activity but completely abolish covalent nucleotide binding (18, 100) . Thus, joining of guanylyltransferase with the methyltransferase region and coupling of these two activities may represent an evolutionary innovation, which took place in a progenitor of the alphavirus superfamily. It should be noted that although the region showing high conservation within the alphavirus-like superfamily encompasses only 200 aa (17), at least alphavirus nsPls require approximately 500 aa for enzymatic activities (18, 104) .\n\nConsiderable structural variation may therefore exist in the capping enzymes of alphavirus-like viruses.\n\nFinally, the active site of nsPl-related proteins may have an additional role in viral RNA replication. Mutations of BMV la active site residues can either abolish or enhance the recruitment of viral RNA to a membrane-bound stable form prior to replication. This is a complex pathway requiring host proteins in addition to la, and even la appears to have several roles in the process. Based on the mutation data, one of these roles could either be influenced by binding of substrates involved in RNA capping or more directly involve a direct recognition of the RNA cap structure by la, as one step of recruiting RNA from translation to replication (105).\n\nNsP1 is tightly associated with membranes both in alphavirus-infected cells and when expressed alone in mammalian cells (112, 113) . It can only be released to solution by detergents or highly alkaline solutions (pH 12) (112, 114) . The tight membrane interaction of nsP1 is mediated by covalent palmitoylation of one or more of the cysteine residues 418-420 in SFV nsP1, and a single-cysteine 420 in SIN nsP1 (113, 114) (Fig. 5) . Conserved cysteine(s) are found in this position in all alphavirus nsPls, suggesting that palmitoylation is a conserved feature. However, if the palmitoylation sites of nsP1 are removed by mutagenesis, the protein still retains a weak peripheral affinity for membranes (114) . Nonpalmitoylated nsP1 can also function in SFV or SIN replication in complexes that appear normal in their localization and morphology. The resultant viruses show only very slightly reduced growth rates in cell culture, but neuropathogenesis of at least SFV encoding nonpalmitoylated nsP1 is abolished in mice (113) . Nonpalmitoylated nsP1 binds to membranes through direct interaction of the polypeptide chain with anionic phospholipids (Fig. 7) . This interaction can be observed for nsP1 expressed in Escherichia coli or by in vitro translation and is mainly mediated by amino acids 245-264, where both positively charged and hydrophobic residues are required for binding (106) . As studied by NMR spectroscopy, the respective synthetic peptide forms an amphipathic alpha-helix, which can interact with liposomes containing acidic phospholipids. Trp259 is crucial for association and intercalates deep in the bilayer (115) . These results are consistent with monotopic binding of nsP1 to membranes, mediated by an amphipathic alpha-helical peptide using both ionic and hydrophobic interactions. Such a mechanism appears to be common for several diverse groups of proteins (116) . The nsP 1 polypeptide segment 245-264 is among the most highly conserved in the alphavirus-like superfamily (17) and could play a role in the membrane association of other superfamily members. All nsPl-related proteins 203 studied to date are associated with membranes (100, 102, 103) , although the binding mechanism has not been studied in other cases. The palmitoylation site is not conserved in other superfamily members and, indeed, they do not appear to be palmitoylated.\n\nAssociation with anionic membrane phospholipids is also required for the enzymatic activities ofnsP1 (106) (Fig. 7) . The methyltransferase and gnanylyltransferase activities of nonpalmitoylated nsP1 are strongly inhibited by detergents and reactivated by added phospholipid vesicles or mixed micelles containing anionic phospholipids. Phospholipids appear to act by inducing a conformational change is nsP1, as cross-linking of the substrate AdoMet is also inhibited by detergents and reactivated by anionic lipids (106) . The behavior of palmitoylated nsP1 is slightly more complex. It is also inactivated by several detergents, but activated by deoxycholate and octylglucoside (94) , which may interact favorably with the palmitoylated form of the protein and permit maintenance of the active conformation. These results indicate that nsP1 is designed to function in a membraneous environment containing anionic phospholipids. When expressed alone in mammalian cells, both palmitoylated and nonpalmitoylated forms of nsP1 localize predominantly to the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane and also to that ofendosomes and lysosomes (112, 114) .\n\nThe plasma membrane and the endosomal apparatus, which are connected by vesicle transport, are rich in anionic phospholipids, and therefore the hypothesis arises that the affinity of nsP1 to these lipids directs its intracellular localization (66) . Palmitoylation could serve a secondary role by fixing the protein tightly to membranes after the initial interaction. However, only palmitoylated forms of nsP 1 expressed in animal cells either by themselves by transfection or in the context of alphavirus infection are capable of inducing thin filopodia-like protrusions of the cell surface and selectively disrupting the actin cytoskeleton (117) . The significance of these phenotypic changes is not clear, but it is intriguing to speculate that they would be connected with the increased pathogenicity of the wild-type virus, as compared to virus-encoding palmitoylation-deficient nsP1 (113) .\n\nSo far, only one of the alphavirus ts mutants, SIN ts11, where Ala348 is changed to Thr, has been mapped to nsP1 (46) . The phenotype oftsll has been highly informative, as it exhibits a rapid and selective cessation of minus-strand RNA synthesis but does not interfere with plus-strand synthesis catalyzed by stable replication complexes (47) . Ts11 suppresses nsP4 mutant ts24 (Gln191Lys), which in otherwise wild-type background allows reactivation of minus-strand synthesis by the stable replication complexes. This is interpreted to mean that nsP1 always directly participates in minus-strand synthesis during either initiation or elongation (48) . A mutation of the adjacent amino acid in SIN nsP1, Thr349Lys, is able to suppress the effect of a normally nonviable change in nsP4 2 0 4 I(,J~J(RLiiJNEN AND AHOLA of the N-terminal Tyr to Ala, Arg, or Leu. As an alteration of the nsP4 amino terminus appears to also cause a defect in minus-strand synthesis, it can be hypothesized that an interaction of these regions of nsP1 and nsP4 is required for minus-strand synthesis or promoter recognition (118) (Fig. 3A) .\n\nNsP2 is the largest replicase protein consisting of 794-807 aa residues among different alphaviruses. Several SIN RNA-negative ts mutants of group A have been mapped to various parts of nsP2 (46, 59, 119) . They indicate that nsP2 functions in both the regulation of subgenomic RNA synthesis and the regulation of shut-off of minus-strand synthesis (see Section IV). According to sequence comparisons, the N-terminal half of nsP2 has sequence motifs typical for RNA and DNA helicases, whereas the C-terminal part resembles papain-like cysteine proteinases ( Fig. 8) (88, 120, 121) .\n\nDirect evidence of nucleosidetriphosphatase (NTPase) activity has been demonstrated for purified nsP2 preparations expressed in E. coli (122) . The activity is associated also with the 470 N-terminal amino acids of the protein.\n\nNTPase activity is stimulated by poly(a), poly(U), oligo(A), and tRNA. Mutation of the putative NTP-binding site GVPGSGK192S to GVPGSGN192S inhibits the NTPase activity. Both nsP2 and nsP2-N bind to single-stranded RNA and can be cross-linked to oxidized ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP. When the GNS mutation was introduced to the SFV genome, no virus replication could be detected. After longer incubation, a revertant virus appeared, in which GNS had been back-mutated to GKS (122, 123) . NsP2 is also an RNA helicase, which can unwind partially double-stranded RNA preparations in the presence of NTPs and dNTPs (124) . The reaction is inhibited by the GNS mutation suggesting that NTPase activity is necessary to drive the unwinding (125) . The helicase activity is inhibited in NaC1 concentrations higher than 100 mM. So far, helicase activity has not been demonstrated for the nsP2-N fragment.\n\nAfter demonstration of RNA helicase activity for nsP2, it could be presumed that all homologous proteins encoded by members of the alphavirus-like superfamily have helicase activity. The role of helicase in the replication cycle of positive-strand RNA viruses remains mysterious, although it is often thought to either separate double-stranded RNAs or remove secondary structures from template RNAs. A ts mutant within the helicase domain of BMV la encodes a protein defective in all forms of RNA synthesis, consistent with this line of thinking (126) . On the other hand, the phenotype of SIN RNA-negative ts mutants located in the helicase is not very clear-cut but has been interpreted to support a role in the conversion from negative-strand to positive-strand synthesis (119) .\n\nFinally, mutations in the helicase motifs of BMV la completely prevent minusstrand synthesis but also disrupt severely the initial recruitment of viral RNAs to the replication complex (105) . Thus, the helicase proteins are likely to have multiple functions at different stages of the replication cycle, which need to be untangled in further experiments.\n\nAs described above, the methyltransferase and guanylyltransferase activities needed in the capping of alphavirus RNAs are carried out by nsP1 (see Section VI,A). However, nsP1 lacks RNA triphosphatase activity essential for mRNA capping (97, 98) . Using short y-32P-labeled RNA molecules for screening, nsP2 has been identified as an RNA triphosphatase for both SFV and SIN. This activity, which removes specifically only the outmost y-phosphate, is also associated with the nsP2-N fragment, previously shown to have NTPase activity (122, 12 7) . Unlike the helicase activity, the RNA triphosphatase activity tolerates relatively high-salt concentrations. There is an absolute requirement for divalent cations, indicating that the alphavirus enzyme belongs to the metal-dependent RNA triphosphatases (98) . The GNS mutation in the NTP-binding site inactivated the triphosphatase activity, suggesting that NTPase and RNA triphosphatase reactions take place in the same reaction center. If so, NTPs should competitively inhibit the RNA triphosphatase reaction, as shown for, e.g., vaccinia virus-capping enzyme (128, 129) . However, this is not the case, as addition of GTP rather enhanced the triphosphatase activity, suggesting that hydrolysis of y-phosphate of NTPs and that of RNA take place in different reaction centers. This mode has been suggested for flavivirus NS3 protein, which is a 68-kDa multifunctional protein with NTPase/RNA triphosphatase/protease/RNA 206 ~RIAINEN AND AHOLA helicase activities (130) . It must be remembered that triphosphatase activity is needed only once during the synthesis of an RNA molecule, while RNA helicase/NTPase activities may be required throughout the synthesis.\n\nBoth mapping of active site residues (90) and assaying the sensitivity to inhibitors (131) strongly support the hypothesis that the C-terminal part of nsP2 is a papain-like cysteine protease. To better understand the complex enzymatic processing of the nonstructural polyprotein (see Section V), nsP2 and a soluble C-terminal fragment, Pro39, consisting of amino acid residues 459-799 of SFV nsP2, was recently expressed and purified (131) . In vitro synthesized, labeled, proteolytically inactive polyproteins P12 cA, p2CA3, P12 cA, P34, P12CA3, P12CA34, with the Cys478Ala mutation in the predicted active site of the enzyme, were used as substrates for Pro39 and nsP2. Cleavage was observed at all sites but with different efficiences. Site 3/4 (between nsP3 and nsP4) was cleaved most readily, site 1/2 next, and site 2/3 poorly (Fig. 1) .\n\nIn order to eliminate possible shielding effects within the polyprotein, short cleavage site sequences were joined to a thioredoxin carrier. By this means, it was possible to study the proteolysis in vitro with purified reagents. The cleavage products were isolated, and their masses and N-terminal sequences were determined. These results show that (i) the cleavage takes place at the same sites as those determined in virus-infected cells (132, 133) ; (ii) the cleavage at site 3/4 is most efficient; (iii) about 5000-fold more enzyme is required for complete cleavage at site 1/2, whereas cleavage at site 2/3 remains poor even with huge excess of Pro39-enzyme (131) . These results are compatible with the previous observations that processing at site 3/4 takes readily place in trans. The poor cleavability of site 1/2 cannot be due to inaccessibility for the enzyme in this in vitro system. Rather, it suggests that some cofactor(s) is needed. This hypothetical \"factor\" is evidently present in polyproteins P12, P123, and P1234, in which the cleavage at site 1/2 takes place in cis. The very inefficient cleavage at site 2/3 is surprising, since P23 is cleaved rapidly after expression in insect cells and after in vitro translation (92; Merits et al., unpublished) . In the polyprotein precursors P1234 and P123 the cleavage of 2/3 site must be preceded by cleavage at the site 1/2 yielding P23 or P234 (89, 92) . Thus, cleavage at site 2/3 must also require a \"cofactor,\" which is probably different from that needed in the cleavage at site 1/2. The specificity of the cleavage at all three sites is determined solely by the protease moiety of nsP2, but the efficiency of the cleavage requires unidentified cofactors.\n\nImmunofluorescence microscopy has shown that of the nsPs, only nsP2 is transported to the nuclei and nucleoli of SFV-infected cells (134) . Cell fractionation and immunoprecipitation experiments showed that about 25% of labeled nsP2 was associated with cytoplasmic membranes sedimenting at 15,000g, 25% remained in the supernatant fraction, and about 50% in the nuclear fraction. The transport took place already early in infection, and nsP2 was detectable in the nuclear matrix fraction within 5 min in pulse-chase experiments, reaching 50% in 20 min. NsP2 had to be cleaved from its precursors (P12 and P123) before transport took place. When nsP2 was expressed alone in BHK21 cells using an SV40-based vector, almost all of the protein was transported to the nucleus.\n\nA deletion analysis was carried out to find the putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) of nsP2. We identified a pentapeptide region PR64sRRV responsible for the nuclear transport of nsP2 (Fig. 8) . Mutations changing arginines 648-649 to aspartic acids (RDR, DRR, and DDR) resulted in cytoplasmic nsP2. A fusion protein, consisting of fl-galactosidase and 232 C-terminal amino acid residues ofnsP2, was transported to the nucleus only if it had an intact PRRRVsequence. Further sequences, especially within region 470-490, were required for nucleolar targeting (135) . The NLS of nsP2 was also functional in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, since expression of SFV P1234 resulted in the accumulation of nsP2 in the nucleus (136) .\n\nWhen the RDR mutation was introduced to infectious cDNA, transfection of cells with the 42S transcript resulted in virus production (SFV-RDR), showing that functional NLS of nsP2 is not vital for SFV replication. A closer analysis of the synthesis of nsP2 and its precursors showed that the synthesis of nsPs was delayed early in infection. Later in infection, there was a considerable delay in the processing of the polyproteins (P1234, P123, and P12). There was also a clear delay in the virus release from the SFV-RDR mutant-infected cells. However, the final yields were the same as those with the wild type. Normally, SFV inhibits cellular protein and RNA and DNA syntheses efficiently (137) . There is a clear difference in the inhibition of host cell DNA synthesis at 6 h after infection between wild type (13% of uninfected control cells) and SFV-RDR (about 50%). No significant difference in the inhibition of host protein synthesis was found between the wild type and the mutant. Most interestingly, SFV-RDR has lost its pathogencity for adult mouse injected intraperitoneally (123) .\n\nBoth wild-type and SFV-RDR are neuroinvasive after intraperitoneal inoculation. However, wild-type SFV spreads rapidly, infecting cells throughout the brain, while SFV-DRD infection is confined to small loci of cells. When mice deficient in type I interferon responses were infected with SFV-RDR, the virus was distributed widely in the brain causing death (137a). These results stress the importance of the interferon system as a host defence mechanism. They also show that a component of RNA polymerase complex can be vital for the neuropathogenicity of SFV. The slower processing of P1234 strongly suggests that the RDR mutation affects the protease moiety of nsP2, causing a delay in early replication events. This delay may be vital for the host defense system to be able to limit the infection to the primary foci of infected cells. Thus, the nuclear localization of nsP2 may reflect the structural requirements of the multifunctional nsP2 protein rather than a separate nuclear function.\n\nMutation of the nsP1 palmitoylation site also results in a viable but apathogenic SFV mutant, which causes viremia in mice, but no infectious virus is detectable in the brain (see Section VI,B). In HeLa and BHK cells, there is a delay in virus replication during infection (113) . Furthermore, deletion of 50 amino acid residues from the variable region of SFV nsP3 results in viable but apathogenic virus mutant (see Section VIII,B). There is a clear reduction in the RNA synthesis rate between 2.5 and 6 h after infection, which results in a delay of virus release from the cells, although final virus yields are same as those with the wild type (138) . One simple possibility is that, with all these mutants, the delay in virus replication is enough for the host to successfully limit the infection of brain cells, which usually causes the death of the animals in wild-type SFV infection. However, further studies may reveal that each of these proteins has specific functions in the pathogenesis of alphaviruses.\n\nAlphavirus nsP3 is an intriguing hybrid protein. Its N-terminal domain of unknown function exhibits a high degree of similarity to some cellular proteins, whereas its carboxy terminus is hypervariable in length and sequence even among alphaviruses. Approximately 320 N-terminal aa of nsP3 show conservation between different alphaviruses. These are followed by a \"tail\" region of 150-250 aa, rich in acidic residues serine and threonine and devoid of predicted secondary structure (Fig. 9A) . A main line of investigation by us and others has been the characterization of nsP3 \"tail\" phosphorylation.\n\nThe most N-terminal 160 aa of alphavirus nsP3 form a small domain, which shows an unusual pattern of conservation. Related sequences are found not only in the genomes of rubella virus and hepatitis E virus but also in otherwise unrelated coronaviruses (but not in alphavirus-like plant viruses or coronaviruslike arteriviruses) (120) . Recently, it has become apparent that this domain is widely, although not universally, distributed in bacteria, archae, and eukaryotes (139) . It usually exists on its own as a small protein, but the human genome also contains open reading frames in which this domain is repeated. A gene termed BAL, which contains a duplicated nsP3-like domain, is a highly expressed risk factor in certain aggressive lymphomas (140) . The conservation between viral and cellular homologs is unusually high for an RNA virus protein, reaching up to 35-40% sequence identity (139) . Furthermore, an unusual class of histone variants found in animal ceils predominantly associated with the inactivated X chromosome, the macrohistones H2A, contains a more distantly related nsP3like domain following the core histone domain (139) . The biochemical function of the nsP3 domain remains unknown, but the high conservation points to a basic and essential role in catalysis or binding. A possible clue is provided by the yeast gene YBR022w, the product of which was shown to hydrolyze ADP-ribosel\"phosphate (141) . However, the yeast homolog is much less related to human and bacterial proteins than the latter are to each other or to nsP3, pointing to a possible divergence of function. Furthermore, a more general role for such an unusual nucleotide compound may be difficult to envision. Nevertheless, nsP3-1ike proteins could potentially be phosphoesterases hydrolyzing an as yet unidentified substrate.\n\nNsP3 is phosphorylated on threonine and more heavily on serine, but not on tyrosine (142, 143) . Deletion mapping suggested that the phosphorylation sites of SIN and SFV nsP3 are mainly located in the variable C-terminal region (138, 144) . This has been proven in the case ofSFV nsP3, where the phosphorylation sites have been mapped by mass spectrometric methods (I45), supported by mutation analysis (138) . The phosphorylation pattern is complex, as a total of 16 possible sites (Ser320, 327, 332, 335, 347, 348, 349, 352, 356, 359, 362, 367, and Thr344, 345, 350, 354) can become phosphorylated. Differentially phosphorylated forms of the protein exist, since forms containing from 7 up to the 12 possible phosphates in the region Thr344-Ser367 have been detected. Based on point mutational analysis, Thr344/Thr345 appear to be the major threonine phosphorylation sites. Thus, phosphorylation is confined to a small subregion of the tail (Fig. 9A) , the deletion of which abolishes phosphorylation both in the cells expressing nsP3 alone and in the context of virus infection (138, 145) . \n\nThe kinases responsible for phosphorylation of nsP3 remain unknown. Although a kinase resembling casein kinase II in its biochemical properties can phosphorylate SIN nsP3 (143) , the presence of multiple sites with dissimilar sequence contexts suggests phosphorylation by multiple cellular kinases (138) .\n\nSimilarly, the role of phosphorylation in RNA replication is not clear. Although phosphorylation is not essential, as deletions reducing or abolishing phosphorylation are tolerated, the deletions have biological effects. Deletions in SIN nsP3 tail reduce plaque formation in mosquito cells (144) , and deletions in SFV nsP3 tail reduce the level of RNA synthesis in BHK cells, although virus growth remains unchanged (138) . Most interestingly, a SFV variant devoid of nsP3 phosphorylation also exhibits greatly reduced mouse pathogenicity (138) .\n\nAnother study has stressed the importance of the C-terminal variable region of nsP3 for neurovirulence of SFV in mice (146) . Phosphorylation and the entire variable tail ofnsP3, which has been subject to rapid alteration during alphavirus evolution, may be involved in the optimization and fine-tuning of replication in diverse host cell types.\n\nNsP3 has a weak peripheral affinity for membranes (138) and it may contribute to the membrane association of the replication complex. When expressed alone in mammalian cells, nsP3 associates with unidentified cytoplasmic vesicles, which do not contain endosomal or lysosomal markers (65) . Membrane association is mediated by the region of nsP3 conserved within alphaviruses and it does not require phosphorylation (138) . However, in SFV-infected cells, nsP3 found in the membrane-associated replication complex fraction is phosphorylated to a greater extent than soluble nsP3 (142) .\n\nGenetic experiments have also failed to define a precise role for nsP3, although it is essential for RNA synthesis (46) . Both classical and linker insertion ts mutants indicate that nsP3 functions in the formation of early replication complexes synthesizing negative-strand RNA (49, 147) , where it presumably is present in precursors P123 or P23. More surprisingly, an insertion at SIN nsP3 aa 252 leads to a specific defect in subgenomic RNA synthesis (147) . No information is available concerning the functions of nsP3-like sequences of other viruses.\n\nNsP4 (607-614 aa in different alphaviruses) contains a large C-terminal domain of almost 500 aa related in sequence and predicted secondary structure to RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (16, 148) (Fig. 9B) . Experiments with ts mutants strongly support the contention that nsP4 is the catalytic polymerase subunit. SIN mutations Gly153Glu (ts6) and Gly324Glu (tsll0) map to nsP4 (149) . Ts6 causes a rapid cessation of all RNA synthesis when cells are shifted to ALPHAVIRUS NONSTRUCTURAL PROTEINS 211 nonpermissive temperature (47, 76) , and tsll0 has a similar but milder phenotype (149) . The ts6 defect is reproduced in polymerase extracts prepared from infected cells, which enabled an elegant demonstration that the defect affects elongation of RNA chains first initiated at the permissive temperature (71) . SIN mutations causing resistance to pyrazofurin, a compound lowering cellular UTP and CTP levels, also map to nsP4 and may increase the affinity of the polymerase for pyrimidine nucleotides (150) . Finally, a mutation Gln191 Lys in SIN nsP4 causes a reactivation of minus-strand synthesis at the restrictive temperature, a phenotype similar to many nsP2 mutants, indicating that nsP4 is also involved in the regulation of minus-strand synthesis shut-off (57) (see Section IV, B).\n\nThe small N-terminal extension of nsP4 has no conserved counterparts in other viruses and it has no known enzymatic activity (92) . It may be involved in interactions with other components of the repliCation complex. A doublemutation Val425Ala in nsP2 and Gln93Arg in nsP4 is required for the phenotype of SIN tsll8, which might among other possibilities suggest that the helicase domain of nsP2 interacts with the polymerase to form a functional complex (149) . The N-terminal amino acid of mature nsP4 is normally a tyrosine, and only an aromatic amino acid or histidine is functional at the N terminus of SIN nsP4 (51, 151) . Alteration of the nsP4 N terminus to normally nonviable residues appears to cause a defect in minus-strand RNA synthesis, which can be suppressed by a mutation in nsP1 (see Section VI,C). This is interpreted to support a role for nsPl-nsP4 interaction in minus-strand synthesis or promoter interaction (118) .\n\nThe bulk of nsP4 is unstable in alphavirus-infected cells, although a stable fraction presumably associated with the polymerase complex also exists (85, 86, 152, 153) . NsP4 is degraded by the N-end rule pathway, as it bears a destabilizing N-terminal Tyr residue (154) , and it is accordingly stabilized by inhibitors of proteosome activity (92) . The amount of nsP4 can thus be regulated at multiple levels. Translation ofnsP4 requires a readthrough of a termination codon in many alphaviruses, production of active polymerase complexes requires cleavage of nsP4 from the nonstructural polyprotein, and nsP4 is susceptible for degradation by the proteosome system.\n\nAfter alphavirus entry and uneoating, which may take place in the close vicinity of endosomes, the genome RNA is subjected to translation. As a single virus particle can cause infection (155) , we have to think that one RNA molecule is first translated, followed by its recruitment as a template for minus-strand synthesis. These primary events cannot be detected by available techniques. Experiments described in Section IV, A indicate that P1234, cleaved at site 3/4, yields the minus-strand RNA polymerase, P123 plus nsP4, although it is not Kfi~RL~INEN AND AHOLA known whether one heterodimer constitutes an active complex. Our recent results with expression of uncleavable polyproteins P1234 and P123 in insect and mammalian cells have shown that they both bind to intracellular membranes and become palmitoylated (Salonen et al., unpublished) . Thus, we can expect that the minus-strand RNA polymerase is membrane bound, probably by a mechanism similar to that demonstrated for nsP1 (see Section VI,B). We assume that several rounds of translation take place, resulting in a small pool of membrane-bound polyprotein.\n\nA polymerase complex recognizes the conserved sequences at the 5' and 3' ends of the parental 42S RNA genome, possibly through joint activity of the nsP 1 portion of P123, and nsP4 (Fig. 3A) . A complete uncapped complementary RNA is synthesized, which has an unpaired extra G residue at the 3' end of the minus strand, the origin of which is not known (156, 157) . A similar extra G residue at the 3'end of cucumber mosaic satellite virus minus strand RNA is essential for RNA replication (158) . As there'is no evidence of the existence of free 42S RNA minus-strands, a double-stranded RNA may be synthesized (23, 24, 45, 47, 55, 159) . The polymerase may utilize the plus-strand template for only one round of minus-strand synthesis. This would explain why only about 20% of synthesized RNA is of negative polarity early in infection (45) . The occurrence of homologous recombination and the ease of creation of defective-interfering RNAs indicate that template switching can take place, presumably during minusstrand synthesis (37, 160) .\n\nThe shift from minus-strand to plus-strand RNA synthesis requires the proteolytic processing of P123 (see Section IV,B). The 42S RNA minus strand acts as a template, but whether it is part of either double-or single-stranded RNA is not definitively known. It can be deduced that the synthesis of the plus strand starts from the penultimate base. The presence of replicative intermediate RNA with nascent plus strands has suggested a model, according to which a single minus strand is copied by several polymerase molecules (23, 24) (Fig. 3C) . According to this model, the double-stranded replicative forms RFI, II, and III arise during RNA isolation by hybridization of the excess plus strands to the minus-strand template. The same replication complex can alternate between synthesis of 42S and 26S RNA, regulated by an extra \"soluble\" nsP2 transcription factor (59, 79) ( Fig. 3D and 3E ). An important feature of the late replication complex is its stability, as it continues to make both 42S RNA and 26S RNA for several hours using the same minus strand as template.\n\nWe have recently shown that all four nsPs as well as nascent RNA are associated with small invaginations, or spherules, of alphavirus-specific large cytoplasmic vacuoles, CPVs (Fig. 4) (66) . CPVs are modified endosomes and lysosomes (64) (65) (66) 112) . We have suggested that each spherule represents one unit of replication, carrying a 42S RNA minus-strand template as well as a set of late RNA polymerases, each consisting of nsPl-nsP4 (66) . This hypothesis is supported The membrane association of the replication complex has interesting consequences. Since the polymerase is fixed to the membrane, the template RNA must move. If a single spherule constitutes a unit of replication, the template RNA of about 11.5 kb must be packed within the spherule of a diameter of about 50 nm. If the template were double-stranded RNA, the packing would be even tighter. In order to achieve continuous synthesis of plus strands, the template should preferably be circular. The classical model of RI, with one template occupied by several polymerases (Fig. 3C) , is difficult to reconcile with polymerases that are fixed to the membrane. The problem could be solved, assuming that the same template is successively passing from one membrane-associated polymerase to another in a circular manner (Fig. 10) \n\nKJ~RI)(INEN AND AHOLA nsP1 and nsP2 (Fig. 6 ) must presumably take place soon after initiation. Anionic membrane lipids are a vital cofactor for nsP1 at this stage. So far, there is no direct experimental data concerning the role of the RNA helicase activity of nsP2.\n\nThe presence of spherules also on the outer surface of the plasma membrane, in addition to CPVs (63, 64, 66) , has led us to propose the following hypothesis. The primary assembly of the replication complex takes place in association with endosomes, or the plasma membrane, through the affinity of the lipid-binding peptide of nsP1 to phosphatidyserine-rich lipids (Fig. 7) . Only a fraction of the replication complexes assemble correctly and manage to recruit a template. After proteolytic cleavages, the components of unsuccessful complexes dissociate from each other, and nsP1 associates permanently with the plasma membrane. NsP2 is transported to the nucleus, and nsP3 and nsP4 remain distributed in the cytoplasm. The correctly assembled complexes participate in the endosomal circulation, redistributing the complexes to new endosomes and finally to lysosomes (66) .\n\nWe have aimed at emphasizing throughout this review how genetic, virological, biochemical, and cell biological approaches have complemented each other in providing a better understanding of alphavirns RNA replication and the replication complex itself. Even though progress has been made, our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of RNA replication is far from complete. The threedimensional structures of the nsPs are required to further define their roles in RNA replication. An even more demanding task is to isolate, or reconstitute, the unit of replication in functional form."}
