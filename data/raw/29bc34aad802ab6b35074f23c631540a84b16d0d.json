The ratio of transmission rates decreased dramatically from January 23 to 27 likely due to the rigorous public health intervention implemented by the government beginning on January 23, 2020. The mean duration of the infectious period was 6 to 9 days. We have predicted the trend of infection sizes which became stable in provinces around February 19 to 24, 2020, and the date of containment would be one-week later in Wuhan.\n\nWuhan [2, 3, 11, 12, 13, 14] . In practice, it becomes crucial to monitor quantitative changes in transmission rates and the effective reproduction number 23 R t over time to reveal the impacts of control measures [15, 16, 17, 18, 19] . The 24 transmissibility depends on the biological properties of the coronavirus, as 25 well as the contact patterns which can be intervened at the national or social 26 levels in populations. The dynamic changes in transmissibility of in Wuhan and across provinces in China remain unknown. We hypothe- 28 sized that there could be a significant reduction of transmissibility with time 29 which is in accordance with the public health interventions in Wuhan and 30 other provinces. 31 Here we provide a real-time model-based analysis to estimate trends in 32 transmissibility of COVID-19 from January 20 to February 13 in Wuhan, 33 Hubei and other 28 provinces in China and forecast the turning point to First, we build an index \u03b1 k to represent the baseline infected cases in 102 province k on 20 January, 2020. Particularly, we will use T R k , F L k and M I k 103 to measure the relationship between provice k and Wuhan. We suppose\n\nwhere \u03b2 \" p\u03b2 1 , \u03b2 2 , \u03b2 3 q 1 are estimated by the observed Y kt in provinces k \"\n\nwhere '\"' means 'distributed as'.\n\nUnder the unified leadership of the central goverment, we suppose the 113 trend of \u03b3 kt over day t is the same for 28 provinces, that is, \u03b7 kt \" \u03b7 t is 114 independent of k so that 115 \u03b3 kt \" \u03b7 t\u02c6\u03b3k,t\u00b41 .\n\nTo avoid strong assumptions about the evolution of the epidemic, we allow 116 \u03b7 t to be arbitray function of t. We determine the functional form of \u03b7 t by 117 pointwise estimating \u03b7 t and checking the resulting pattern over t. Denote 118 the resulting functional form for \u03b7 t by \u03b7 t \" \u03b7 t paq.\n\nFinally, we notice that\n\nWith the chain calculation, we have dW kt \" \u03b3 kt \u015b t\u00b41 j\"0 p\u03b3 kj`1 qW k0 and W kt \" 121 \u015b t\u00b41 j\"0 p\u03b3 kj`1 qW k0 , where W k0 \" \u03b1 k and \u03b3 k0 \" 0. In practice, the infected 122 patients will be isolated and removed from the infectious source. With the 123 notation m of duration of infectious period, we hence have\n\nDenote \u03b3 1 \" p\u03b3 11 ,\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8, \u03b3 K1 q 1 and all of the parameters by \u03b4 \" p\u03b3 1 1 , a 1 , \u03b2 1 q 1 .\n\nTaken (1), (2), (3) and (5) together, the loglikelihood function was\n\nwhere C is a constant independent of \u03b4, m is determined by minimizing author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. The modeling and the loglikelihood function for Hubei are similar with 131 those for 28 provinces except that F L k is replaced by RM k and provinces are 132 replaced by cities, because there are not flights between the cities in Hubei 133 and Wuhan, and the most people leave Wuhan by cars or buses. Specifically,\n\nThe modeling and the likelihood function for Wuhan are similar with 135 those for 28 provinces except that \u03b1 k is directly estimated by the diagnosed 136 cases in Wuhan. \n\nHubei were chosen based on the lowest prediction errors in Supplementary  Figures 1(a) , 4(a) and 6(a), and \u03b7ptq \" a 0`a1 pt\u00b4t 1 q\u00b4`a 2 pt\u00b4t 2 q\u00b4by With the form of \u03b7ptq \" a 0`a1 pt\u00b4t 1 q\u00b4`a 2 pt\u00b4t 2 q\u00b4with t 1 being January 167 23 and t 2 being January 27 and m \" 6, we estimate \u03b4 \" p\u03b3 1 1 , a 1 , \u03b2 1 q 1 based on 168 t \" 1,\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8, T of 28 provinces using the method displayed in Section 2.
