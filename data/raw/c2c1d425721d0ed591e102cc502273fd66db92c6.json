{"title": "", "body": "To the Editor, Pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus infection has been identified as the cause of a widespread outbreak of febrile respiratory tract infection. On June 11, 2009 , the World Health Organization raised its pandemic alert to the highest level, phase 6.\n\nThe H1N1 influenza virus infection rapidly spread all over Japan after the first case was confirmed in Kobe, Japan, on May 16. The outbreak of this virus had a great impact on the Japanese society. There was a shortage in masks and antiseptic [1, 2] . More than 4800 schools had been closed, medical services were swamped, many companies were forced into bankruptcy, and the stock market price declined [3, 4] . Kobe suffered the most severe impact of the H1N1 influenza in Japan.\n\nPrevious studies on severe acute respiratory syndrome [5] and the seasonal influenza [6] reported that emergency departments (EDs) were overcrowded in the epidemic and that the number of ED ambulance diversion increased. Emergency medical service (EMS) was greatly influenced by the epidemic, whereas it remains unknown whether EMS was influenced by the H1N1 influenza virus pandemic.\n\nIn Japan, the emergency paramedics are allowed to triage patients. When the emergency paramedics contact with patients, they negotiate with hospitalists to find a hospital where physicians can provide the medical support. To investigate the impacts of the H1N1 influenza pandemic on EMS, we studied the situation of EMS during the epidemic provided by the emergency paramedics.\n\nUsing an ambulance dispatch data of the Fire Prevention Bureau of Kobe, we extracted data on patients with fever higher than 37.5\u00b0C who called an ambulance between April 16 and June 16. We examined the following variables including the time between EMS call and arrival at hospital, that between arrival to the site and the departure from it, and the number of times of negotiation by paramedics with hospitalists for patients' acceptance.\n\nTo evaluate the impact of the pandemic on the EMS system, we studied the longitudinal changes in these variables during the pandemic. We defined the period from April 16 to May 16 as the preepidemic stage and that from May 17 to June 16th as the postepidemic stage. We compared these variables in preepidemic stage with those in postepidemic stage.\n\nMann-Whitney U test was used for statistical analysis, and P value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nAn ambulance was called by 961 patients during the study period, 469 and 492 patients in the preepidemic and postepidemic periods, respectively (Fig. 1) . There was no significant difference between the 2 periods ( Table 1) .\n\nThe interval between EMS call and arrival at hospital was significantly longer in the postepidemic period (mean, 28.8 minutes; range, 10.2-97.8 minutes) than in the preepidemic period (mean, 31.3 minutes; range, 9.4-128 minutes) (P b .001) ( Fig. 2 and Table 1 ).\n\nThe number of hospitals with which the paramedics negotiated for patients' transfer was comparable between the 2 periods ( Fig. 3 and Table 1 ), whereas the sojourn time at the site was prolonged in the postepidemic period (mean, 17.0 minutes; range, 4.0-70 minutes) compared with the preepidemic period (mean, 14.0 minutes; range, 1.0- Fig. 1 The number of febrile patients who called an ambulance remained unchanged during the study period. 86 minutes). The difference was statistically significant (P b .001) ( Fig. 4 and Table 1 ). This study showed that H1N1 influenza pandemic did not have a great impact on the EMS system of Kobe.\n\nInterestingly, the number of febrile patients who called an ambulance remained unchanged during the study period. This finding was in contrast to the situation in the EDs and the clinics, which were overcrowded with patients who had been scared by the repetitive press reports. Patients with H1N1 influenza occasionallydevelopedseveremanifestations.Itisreasonableto assume that most patients with suspected H1N1 influenza infection might have visited clinic at its early stages on foot.\n\nIt is interesting that paramedics needed an extra time of 3 minutes to triage patients. Considering that the number of hospitals with which the paramedics negotiated for patients' transfer was comparable between the 2 periods, this extra time was required to provide the hospitalists with precise information on febrile patients, including symptoms and records of oversea travel. This finding is consistent with the fact that paramedics were required to fill in a form about patients' information during the study period. It is unlikely that hospitalists refused patients with possible H1N1 influenza infection because of fears of in-hospital spread of the infection. Fig. 3 The number of hospitals with which the paramedics negotiated for patients' transfer was comparable between the 2 periods. Fig. 2 The interval between EMS call and arrival at hospital was significantly longer in the postepidemic period than in the preepidemic period.\n\nIn response to \u2026.\n\nWe thank \u204e\u204e\u204e for their insightful comments on our article concerning the diagnosis and management of preexcitation in the emergency department [1] . We would like to clarify the following points:\n\nAtrial fibrillation can indeed present with an apparently regular rhythm and at rates that would seem concordant with simple reentrant tachycardia (approximately 150 beats/min). Yet in the scenario presented by \u204e\u204e\u204e\u204e, which attempts to differentiate atrial fibrillation with ventricular preexcitation from superventricular tachycardia with aberrant conduction in the bundle of His, the QRS complex configuration should readily differentiate the 2, at least in the classic case of aberrant conduction with left or right bundle branch blockade, and should not be a major concern (preexcitation should not give a bundle branch block morphology).\n\nThe difficulty occurs then when one is not presented with a regular wide-complex tachycardia with a classic QRS complex morphology for bundle branch block. In this case, clinicians must strongly consider ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the differential diagnosis. Fortunately, some guidance exists in this situation. Steurer et al [2] studied this scenario and found that any of the following criteria identified VT (versus ventricular preexcitation) with a 75% Fig. 4 The sojourn time at the site was prolonged in the postepidemic period compared with the preepidemic period."}
