{"title": "A quantile regression analysis of tourism market growth effect on the hotel industry", "body": "The growth of the inbound tourism market (tourism growth hereafter) is expected to have a strong effect on the hotel industry. On the one hand, tourism growth can directly enhance the development of hotel industry by increasing the hotel occupancy rate and hence sales revenue. Chen (2010) and Chen and Kim (2010) found that tourism growth proxied by the growth rate of total foreign tourist arrivals (GTA) in Taiwan has a significant influence on hotel sales and profitability. Kim et al. (2006) revealed that tourism growth can cause significant economic growth in Taiwan. Chen (2007b) further showed that improved economic/business conditions caused by tourism growth can increase sales and strengthen the financial performance of hospitality-related companies in Taiwan. Accordingly, tourism growth, on the other hand, can significantly promote economic growth and improve business conditions, which in turn can have an indirect effect on the hotel industry.\n\nAs hotel sales/profitability increase due to tourism growth in Taiwan, one interesting question arises: How well do hotel firms perform? Indeed, financial performance of hotel firms is expected to benefit from tourism growth because of better economic * Tel.: +1 509 335 2317.\n\nE-mail address: ming-hsiang.chen@wsu.edu condition and hence more sales earnings. Moreover, according to equity valuation model, equity prices reflect investors' expectations about future corporate earnings. Hence, given an improved hotel earnings due to tourism growth, a better equity performance of hotel companies is anticipated.\n\nWhile the financial performance of hotel firms is expected to be closely related to tourism growth, previous hospitality studies found no significant link between tourism growth and hotel equity return (HER). Chen (2007a) investigated the effect of some selected economic variables and GTA on HER in Taiwan. The monthly tourism growth had a positive effect on the monthly HER, but the influence was not statistically significant. Similarly, Chen (2010) found that the quarterly tourism growth rate could not significantly explain the quarterly HER. Chen (2011) offered an explanation for the absence of a significant relationship between tourism growth and HER. As mentioned, based on equity valuation model, variations in equity price reflect not only the future earnings stream, but also the perceived riskiness of equity cash flows. In other words, both changes in sales earnings and the perceived riskiness of equity cash flows could cause fluctuations in equity price. He detected that tourism growth has a strong effect on growth rate of hotel sales (GS), but not on the perceived riskiness of equity cash flows.\n\nChen (2011) Note: The number of available observations is 2513. The standard errors for skewness and kurtosis are (6/T) 1/2 and (24/T) 1/2 , respectively. T is the number of sample observations. LM statistic is the Lagrange Multiplier normality test statistic, which is defined as [(T/6)b 2 1 + (T/24)(b2 \u2212 3) 2 ]\u223cx 2 2 , where b1 is the coefficient of skewness, and b2 is the coefficient of kurtosis (Jarque and Bera, 1980) . The critical value at the 1% significance level is 9.21. contraction is statistically different from that in business cycle expansion. Moreover, while the influence of GTA on HER is still irrelevant during expansion periods, tourism growth can significantly enhance HER during contraction periods.\n\nThis study, motivated by abovementioned previous studies, used the quantile regression method to examine the effect of GTA on different quantiles of sales growth and financial performance of hotel firms. Chiang et al. (2010) and Chiang and Li (2012) stated that the ordinary least squares (OLS) method may be inconsistent because it fails to address the information about the tails of a data distribution given that the OLS estimators concentrate on the mean as a measure of location and thus the information about the tails of a distribution is lost. Consequently, the OLS regression test results can be distorted since events or news in the form of extreme outliers in financial markets can significantly influence tail values of a data distribution.\n\nIn particular, the earthquake of September 21, 1999, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, in the US, and the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome on April 22, 2003, significantly harmed GS and HER in Taiwan, causing a large negative fluctuation in hotel sales and equity prices during the period from 1983 to 2013 (Chen, 2010 (Chen, , 2011 . In fact, the summary statistics of GS and HER presented in the next section show that HER has fat tails during the sample period.\n\nThus, by using the quantile regression approach, the study not only addresses the tail information of GS and HER, but also illustrates how tourism growth affects different quantiles of GS and HER. Test results contribute to the hospitality literature by showing a new and interesting finding regarding the relationship between tourism growth and HER. Specifically, the effect of tourism growth on GS and HER is asymmetric and state-dependent, i.e. the influences of tourism growth on GS and HER vary in different quantiles.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the tourism and hotel equity data. Section 3 describes the quantile regression method. Quantile regression test results are reported in Section 4. Section 5 concludes the paper with a discussion of major findings.\n\nThe growth rate of the number of total foreign tourist arrivals (GTA) was used as a proxy for tourism growth (Chen, 2010; Kim et al., 2006) :\n\nwhere TA is the number of total foreign tourist arrivals during the month t. The TA data were taken from the database of the Taiwan Economic Journal (TEJ). The sample period is from January 1983 to December 2012. The growth rate of hotel sales is calculated as:\n\nwhere S is the sales of each hotel firm at the end of the month t.\n\nThe study included equities of seven publicly traded hotel companies-Ambassador Hotel, First Hotel, Grand Formosa Regent Taipei, Hotel Holiday Garden, Leofoo Hotel, Landis Taipei, and Chihpen Royal. Hotel equity return is computed as\n\nwhere P t is the closing price of each hotel equity at the end of month t.\n\nTo capture the effect of the broad equity market movements on hotel sales growth and equity returns, the variable of the overall equity market return was incorporated into regression tests. Note that the stock market reflects expectations about future economic conditions because stock market investors bid up prices when they expect companies to be profitable. An increase in stock prices, indicating that investors expect the economy to grow rapidly, is hence expected to affect hotel equity returns and sales growth. The equity market return (MR) was computed as: MR t = ln TWI t /TWI t\u22121 , where TWI t is the Taiwan weighted index at the end of the month t. All equity data were also taken from the TEJ database. Table 1 presents the summary statistics of GTA, GS, HER, and MR over the entire sample period. The results of statistical tests of the null hypothesis of normality (the Lagrange Multiplier test) are also reported in Table 1 . The skewness test measures the asymmetry of the data distribution about the mean, while kurtosis in excess of (Koenker and Machado, 1999) . * Significant at the 10% level. ** Significant at the 5% level. *** Significant at the 1% level. (Koenker and Machado, 1999) . * Significant at the 10% level. ** Significant at the 5% level. *** Significant at the 1% level.\n\nthree implies that it is fat tailed. The third (skewness) and fourth (kurtosis) moments showed that the distributions of GS (HER) are negatively (positively) skewed and have fat tails. The Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test rejected the normality hypothesis, suggesting that GS and HER do not follow the normal distribution.\n\nThe study performed a panel regression test based on Eq. (4a) to examine the association between GTA and GS by incorporating the potential influences of MRs into the test equation:\n\nwhere GS it is the sales growth rate of hotel i at the month t. Similarly, Eq. (4b) is used to test the relationship between GTA and HERs:\n\nIf GTA can significantly (positively) affect GS (HER), the coefficient b 11 (b 21 ) is expected to be significantly positive and different from zero, since a high GTA would benefit GS (HER). The panel regression tests given in Eqs. (4a) and (4b) can be estimated based on the OLS estimation.\n\nThe study also used a quantile regression method for panel data to analyze whether the relationship between GTA and GS/HER is sensitive to different quantiles of HER dispersions. The quantile regression is more robust and generates more efficient estimates compared to the OLS regression because the quantile regression allows us to estimate the relationship between a dependent variable and its explanatory variables at any specific quantile.\n\nThe quantile regression to estimate the effect of GTA on GS/HER for quantiles is given as (Koenker, 2005) :\n\nwhere y is a dependent variable, x is a vector of independent variables and \u02c7 is a vector of coefficients. The estimates of \u02c7 for a given (\u02c6 ) in Eq. (5a) are obtained by minimizing weighted deviations from the conditional quantile:\n\nwhere the conditional distribution of the dependent variable y (GS/HER) is characterized by different values of the th quantile given x (GTA and MR), \u2208 (0, 1) and is a weighting factor called a check function defined as:\n\nwhere u t = y t \u2212 x t\u02c7. The quantile regression coefficient\u02c6 determines the dependence relationship between GTA and the th conditional quantile of GS/HER, which offers a broader picture, showing the link between GTA and GS/HER.\n\nThe OLS and quantile regression estimation results reported in Table 2 indicate that GTA has a significant effect on GS, even at the different quantiles of GS. Table 2 and Fig. 1 illustrate that the value of the estimated coefficients is positive and stable in magnitude as the quantile increases from .1 to .9, suggesting that the significant effect of GTA on GS is consistent. While MR positively and significantly influences GS based on the OLS regression estimation result, the significant influence exists only at certain quantiles of GS.\n\nAccording to the OLS regression estimation results in Table 3 , the effect of GTA on HER is found be positive, but this influence is not statistically significant at the 10% level, suggesting that the relationship between GTA and HER during the period from January 1983 to December 2013 is non-significant. However, this study yielded some interesting results by looking at the quantile regression tests.\n\nQuantile regression estimation results in Table 3 revealed that the estimated coefficients of GTA on HER have an expected positive sign and are found to be statistically significant only at the low quantiles but not at the median and high quantiles. As shown in Fig. 2 , the quantile regression results also show evidence of asymmetries. The estimated coefficients consistently increase in magnitude as the quantile increases from .1 to .6. However, the estimated coefficients even turn from positive into negative when the quantile is equal to .7 to .9. In comparison, both the OLS and quantile regression estimation results in Table 3 show that MR has a significant impact on HER, even at the different quantiles of HER.\n\nWhile tourism growth was expected to have a strong influence on hotel performance, several hospitality studies failed to find a significant relationship between tourism growth and HER. Using the quantile regression method, this study took a closer look at how tourism growth affects different quantiles of GS and HER, and it offers a new finding regarding the link between tourism growth and HER.\n\nBoth the OLS and quantile regression estimation results indicated a consistent and significant effect of GTA on GS. The result is similar to those reported in Chen (2010) and Chen and Kim (2010) . The OLS estimation results showed that tourism growth has a positive effect on HER, but this positive influence is not statistically significant. This finding is in line with those found in Chen (2007a Chen ( , 2010 . However, the quantile regression test results revealed interesting outcomes. Specifically, it was found that the link between tourism growth and HER is statistically significant at the low quantiles of HER but not at the median and high quantiles of HER. In other words, the significant effect of tourism growth on HER exists only when HER is low, i.e. the association between tourism growth and HER is state-dependent.\n\nEmpirical findings provide two important implications. First, Chen (2007b) revealed that hotel equities in Taiwan have higher returns during periods of better business conditions. Tourism growth has a significant influence on HER when HER is low, and low HER may be due to the effect of business contraction. Therefore, the findings in this study seem to support those found in Chen (2011) , suggesting that the effect of tourism growth on HER depends on the state of economy and that tourism growth can significantly enhance HER during contraction periods.\n\nSecond, Chen et al. (2012) detected that the Taiwanese hotels with a larger size (market value) have higher equity returns. In other words, low HER may be associated with hotels with a small size. Accordingly, this study provides a new finding. While previous studies find no significant relationship between tourism growth and HER, this paper shows that tourism growth has a significant influence on equity returns of small hotel firms."}
