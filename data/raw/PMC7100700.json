{"title": "Mismatched Double-Stranded RNA", "body": "During clinical trials in which HIV-infected patients received IV infusions of mismatched double-stranded RNA at dose levels of 10\u2013570 mg/m2/dose, the most frequent adverse events were flushing, chills, fever, tight chest, dyspnoea, \u2019flu-like symptoms and nausea. All reactions were self-limiting and generally subsided after the infusion was completed. Infusions were usually accompanied by transient leucopenia and then leucocytosis. One patient who received mismatched double-stranded RNA 570 mg/m2 discontinued therapy after developing \u2019flu-like symptoms and fatigue.[8\u201310]\n\nDuring combination therapy with zidovudine and Ampligen\u00ae, toxicity was similar to that caused by zidovudine alone.[11]\n\nIn a study that compared Ampligen\u00ae with placebo in zidovudine recipients, the total number of adverse events did not differ significantly between treatment groups.[12]\n\nIn HIV-1-positive patients undergoing structured treatment interruptions (STI) of HAART, adverse events associated with Ampligen\u00ae were mild and self-limiting. There was no incidence of insulin resistance, hyperlipidaemia, or adverse changes in lactic acid levels.[13]\n\nThe most common adverse events in a clinical trial with metastatic melanoma patients included myalgia, headache and fatigue.[14]\n\nMismatched double-stranded RNA is synergistic with multiple anti-HIV drugs. Combination indices were determined for 14 anti-HIV agents alone and in combination with mismatched double-stranded RNA using dose-effect analyses and the CalcuSyn for Windows software. Mismatched double-stranded RNA was synergistic in combination with abacavir, zidovudine, zalcitabine, didanosine, sta-vudine, efavirenz, indinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir and amprenavir. It was synergistic to antagonistic with lamivudine, delavirdine, nevirapine and saquinavir.[15]\n\n\nPreclinical studies: Ampligen\u00ae reduced serum and liver viral DNA levels in ducks congenitally infected with duck hepatitis B virus, and had at least additive effects with ganciclovir. Ampligen\u00ae had no effect on circulating duck HBsAg and viral replication returned to baseline levels after treatment discontinuation.[16]\n\n\nClinical studies: The effects of mismatched double-stranded RNA on immune function were compared with those of placebo in a randomised, double-blind, crossover study (ACTG 056) in volunteers. Overall, there were no significant differences between the two treatments in terms of production of interferon and biological markers of interferon, T lymphocytic function, lymphocyte proliferative responses and natural killer cell activity. Symptom scores were greater in mismatched double-stranded RNA recipients than in placebo recipients, but symptoms were mild in nature and the between-group difference was only significant on the day after dosing.[10]\n\nIn 15 patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, Ampligen\u00ae normalised the upregulated 2-5A synthetase/RNase L system and cleared human herpesvirus 6 antigen-positive cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures.[17]\n\n\nHIV-infections: Mismatched double-stranded RNA induces expression of the physiologically functioning antiviral protection system (2-5A synthetase/RNase L system) in cells. In vitro, Ampligen\u00ae 9.7 \u00b5g/mL inhibited the HIV-related reduction of Molt-3 cell growth rate by 50%. It acted synergistically with a reverse transcriptase inhibitor and with an antisense oligonucleotide directed against the tat gene.[18]\n\nAmpligen\u00ae did not display any synergism against HIV in vitro when used in combination with didanosine. In contrast, synergism was demonstrated between Ampligen\u00ae and zidovudine at combination ratios ranging from 100 : 1 to 1 : 50.[19] Ampligen\u00ae also acted synergistically with zidovudine against zidovudine-resistant strains.[11]\n\nThe compound has been shown to inhibit human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6) infection in T lymphocytes at concentrations of 100 and 200 \u00b5g/mL,[20,21] and is also active against rotavirus.[22]\n\nMismatched double-stranded RNA was equally active against wild-type HIV and HIV resistant to nevirapine, protease inhibitors and nucleoside reverse trancriptase inhibitors.[15]\n\n\nMelanoma: Ten patients with metastatic melanoma were treated with mismatched double-stranded RNA in an open-label phase I/II trial. The drug was administered IV at low dose (80mg) to one patient, and at high dose (200\u20131000mg) to nine patients, over 30\u201360 minutes twice weekly for 3\u2013111 weeks. Two of the patients receiving high-dose therapy achieved a complete response. Both received maintenance therapy for at least 12 months following this and have remained in complete response without further therapy at 21 and 91 months. Mismatched double-stranded RNA was well tolerated.[14]\n\n\nChronic fatigue syndrome: Ampligen\u00ae significantly improved patients\u2019 physical performance as assessed by Treadmill Exercise Tolerance Testing (ETT) in a 40-week placebo-controlled phase III study in 234 patients with severely debilitating chronic fatigue syndrome. Ampligen 400mg twice weekly was superior to placebo for improved ETT (19.4 vs 5.1%) for the patient population that completed 40 weeks\u2019 treatment and also for the intent-to-treat population (17.7 vs 4.3%) that completed <40 weeks treatment.[23,24]\n\nIn a randomised, placebo-controlled trial, Ampligen\u00ae therapy improved physical and cognitive performance in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, a condition with a possible viral aetiology.[25]\n\nIn a Belgium study, patients with chronic fatigue syndrome were randomised to receive mismatched double-stranded RNA [Ampligen\u00ae] (200\u2013400mg twice weekly) or placebo for 24 weeks. Mismatched double-stranded RNA significantly improved cognitive and physical performance. Physical performance for activities of daily living, measured using the Karnofsky Performance Score, showed an improvement of 43% (from 53 at baseline to 76). Exercise performance was measured by bicycle testing; oxygen uptake improved from 1.16 L/min at baseline to 1.48 L/min after treatment with mismatched double-stranded RNA. The cognitive improvement seen in patients receiving mismatched double-stranded RNA was measured using the cognitive subscale of the SCL 90-R or neuropsychological function tests. Significantly greater improvements were seen in patients receiving mismatched double-stranded RNA compared with placebo. Mismatched double-stranded RNA was generally well tolerated according to a media release (15/10/1996). Of the patients treated with mismatched double-stranded RNA, about 80% experienced an apparent \u2018complete clinical recovery\u2019 after 6 months\u2019 treatment; spontaneous improvement in untreated patients with chronic fatigue syndrome is about 2%.[26,27]\n\n\nHepatitis B: Results of a phase I/II study of mismatched double-stranded RNA 400\u2013600mg two to three times/week in eight patients with chronic hepatitis B indicated that the drug may have an antiviral effect. Four patients lost HBV DNA and three patients became HBeAg seronegative during 24 weeks\u2019 treatment. None of the patients have relapsed.[28]\n\nResults from a phase I study (ACTG 038) were unable to confirm previous beneficial effects of mismatched double-stranded RNA in HIV infection. Thirty-nine HIV-infected patients with asymptomatic disease or early ARC received one of six doses of mismatched double-stranded RNA for 9 or 25 weeks. Mismatched double-stranded RNA had no significant effects on p24 antigenaemia, HIV viraemia or the number of HIV-infected cells. However, the rate of CD4+ cell depletion was reduced; this effect was dose-dependent. In addition, no patient developed an opportunistic infection or any other new HIV-associated symptoms while receiving mismatched double-stranded RNA.[9]\n\nIn patients with at least 6 months of previous zidovudine treatment, Ampligen\u00ae therapy administered prior to the development of advanced stage symptoms was associated with higher CD4 counts and increased immune function compared with untreated patients. Thus, Ampligen\u00ae appears to have activity against zidovudine-resistant HIV strains.\n\nIn a study conducted in 36 zidovudine-treated patients, mismatched double-stranded RNA therapy was most effective when initiated earlier in the course of HIV disease. Over a 48-week study period, patients treated with Ampligen\u00ae (400 or 700mg twice weekly) had a mean decrease in CD4+ count of 52 cells/\u00b5L compared with 89 cells/\u00b5L in placebo recipients. Ampligen\u00ae-treated patients with baseline CD4+ counts \u2265300 cells/\u00b5L showed a mean increase in CD4+ count of 26 cells/\u00b5L, which peaked at week 24. Placebo recipients had a consistent decrease from baseline. A change to Ampligen\u00ae therapy after 48 weeks of placebo treatment reversed the CD4+ decline in seven patients. Ampligen\u00ae recipients were more likely to exhibit a delayed-type hypersensitivity response and less likely to progress to AIDS than placebo recipients.[12]\n\nSignificantly fewer patients relapsed within the first 30 days of structured treatment interruption (STI) when treated with Ampligen\u00ae. In this phase IIb study, the primary endpoint was the mean total time of HAART-free intervals before rebound of plasma HIV-1 RNA. There were two groups of patients: the \u2018Harvard cohort\u2019 of eight newly/acutely HIV-infected patients and the \u2018study group\u2019, designed to be similar to the referenced Harvard cohort. The similarities being (a) HAART was given for \u22659 months; (b) CD4 \u2265400 cells/mL; and (c) HIV RNA levels below 50 copies/mL. The main difference between the groups was that the Harvard cohort were studied within weeks or months of initial infection whereas the study group had been infected with HIV for several years. Interim data analysis were performed with a control (non-Ampligen\u00ae treated) group obtained from scientific literature meta-analysis and a second with a concurrent control (non-Ampligen\u00ae-treated) group obtained from identical, participating medical institutions. In the meta-analysis, none of the patients relapsed while on Ampligen\u00ae within the first 30 days compared with 86% of a control group of patients (p = 0.012). In the second analysis, the median duration of STI in the Ampligen\u00ae group was >18 weeks, compared with 7 weeks in the concurrent control, non-Ampligen\u00ae group.[29]\n\nIn a phase IIb study (AMP 720) of patients with HIV undergoing up to three structured treatment interruptions (STI) of HAART, Ampligen\u00ae (400mg IV twice weekly) therapy resulted in significant prolongation of controlled HIV viraemia, compared with untreated controls. Patients taken off HAART but given Ampligen\u00ae (n = 7) continued to show virus levels <5000 copies/mL for a mean of 25 weeks and counting. In the control group, patients (n = 9) taken off HAART and not given Ampligen\u00ae, developed an HIV rebound within a mean of 13 weeks. In addition, the Ampligen\u00ae group demonstrated an increase in CD8+ cells, suggesting induction of immunogenicity.[13,30,31]"}
