{"title": "", "body": "Glycyrrhizic acid as the antiviral component of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. against coxsackievirus A16 and enterovirus 71 of hand foot and mouth disease\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common viral illness that usually affects infants and young children of 5 years old or younger. The clinical features of HFMD typically begin with mild fever, sore throat, poor appetite, and diarrhea. A day or two later, blisters form in the mouth and a rash develops on the cheeks, gums, and the tongue, potentially with life-threatening neurological complications, such as encephalitis. The causative agents of HFMD have been identified as coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) and enterovirus 71 (EV71) viruses, accounting for more than 70% of the cases during the 2008 outbreak in China (WHO, 2008) . CVA16 and EV71 are single strand RNA viruses of the Enterovirus genus. The viruses can be spread through direct contact with blisters and other surfaces contaminated with virus-containing fluids or through fecal-oral route. HFMD occurs sporadically around the world since its first report in 1957. Large outbreaks of HFMD with higher morbidity and mortality have become common in the Asia Pacific region. An outbreak in 2008 affected nearly half million children with 126 deaths in eastern China (Yang et al., 2009) . Data reported to the Ministry of Public Health of China showed that more than one million cases annually and hundreds of deaths associated with HFMD in China for the past 3 years (www.moh.gov.cn). There is no vaccine or specific antiviral drugs available for HFMD. Good hygiene, including hand washing and disinfection of surfaces in child care facilities, therefore remains as the most effective approach to reduce the transmission rate of HFMD (Solomon et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2011) .\n\nThe radices of Glycyrrhiza spp., commonly known as ''Gan Cao'' in Chinese and licorice in English, have been used for thousands of years as an herbal medicine for the treatment of sore throat, cough, bronchitis, peptic ulcers (Das et al., 1989; Krausse et al., 2004) , arthritis, and allergic diseases (Fiore et al., 2005; Asl and Hosseinzadeh, 2008; Kim et al., 2010) . The plant extract has also been used as flavoring agents for food and beverages with a relative safe profile. During the outbreaks of HFMD in China, medicinal herbs or herbal preparations have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy by ameliorating the symptoms of the disease and/or shortening the course of the disease. Most of the herbs with reported therapeutic effectiveness have been used traditionally or folklorically for inflammatory and/or infective diseases (Xue et al., 2011; Cao et al., 2012) .\n\nGlycyrrhiza spp. have been reported with broad antiviral activity (Fiore et al., 2008) and glycyrrhizic acid (GA, also known as glycyrrhizin, glycyrrhizinic acid), the major bioactive component of Glycyrrhiza spp. has demonstrated activity against DNA and RNA viruses. GA at millimolar concentrations inhibits growth and cytopathology of several unrelated viruses, while not affecting cell activity and ability to replicate (Pompei et al., 1979) . Subsequent studies have shown the antiviral activity of GA against several enveloped viruses, including HIV, and SARS related coronavirus (Cinatl et al., 2003; Hoever et al., 2005) , Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated herpesvirus (Curreli et al., 2005; Kang and Lieberman, 2011) , hepatitis C virus (Ashfaq et al., 2011) , respiratory syncytial virus, vaccinia virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus (Fiore et al., 2005 (Fiore et al., , 2008 Pompei et al., 2009) . The compound has not previously been reported to inhibit the infection by nonenveloped viruses.\n\nSome of the plants like Glycyrrhiza uralensis and Houttuynia cordata have been demonstrated with strong antiviral activity against EV71 infection (Kuo et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2009 ). However, the antiviral activity against CVA16 infection and the active components in those herbs are still undetermined. In this study, we aimed to assess the anti-EV71 and CVA16 infection activity of the water extract of Glycyrrhiza uralensis, and further determine whether antiviral activity of Glycyrrhiza uralensis is attributable to GA.\n\nAntibodies to EV71 VP1 protein were purchased from Abnova (Taiwan), to human GAPDH from Bioworld Technology (Minneapolis, MN), and horse radish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibodies from Sigma (St. Lois, MO). Chemicals including acyclovir (ACV), 18b-glycyrrhetinic acid (b-GA), ammonium glycyrrhizate, and methyl thiazolyl diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Liquiritin was from Chengdu Biopurify Pharmaceuticals (Chengdu). Chemiluminescent (ECL) reagent kit with enhanced detection sensitivity was purchased from Thermo Fisher (Pittsburgh, PA).\n\nAfrican green monkey kidney Vero cells were purchased from Cell Bank of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen), 100 U/ml of penicillin and streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine. CVA16 was kindly provided by Dr. C. Zheng of Wuhan University. EV71 was a clinical isolate of the C4 subgenotype by VP1 sequence analysis (Zhang et al., 2010) . The viruses were propagated in Vero cells and virus titers were determined on Vero cells by measuring 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) for EV71 and by a plaque forming assay for CVA16.\n\nSlices of radices of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. were purchased from local drug stores in Nanjing and identified by Ms. Yunxia Xu (Research Assistant, Nanjing University) and with HPLC profiling following instructions in Chinese Pharmacopeia (Fig. 1) . Voucher specimens (2011-18-1 to -5) were stored at Laboratory of Microbial Science and Pharmacy, School of Medicine, Nanjing University. The materials were ground and extracted with boiling water as described in Kuo et al. (2009) . After adjusting the pH of the liquid ( $ 6) with diluted NaOH, the liquid was filtered and tested for antiviral activities or lyophilized for future studies. The lyophilized powder was stored at \u00c0 70 1C and reconstituted in de-ionized water (diH 2 O) prior to experiments.\n\nTo deplete GA, the pH of extract was adjusted to pH 1.5 with 2 M H 2 SO 4 to precipitate GA at 4 1C for overnight. The precipitant and the supernatant were collected by filtration. The precipitant was rinsed with cold water for two times and then lyophilized. Additionally, the supernatant was also lyophilized after adjusting pH with diluted NaOH. Both the precipitant and supernatant were reconstituted in diH 2 O prior to experiments. Acid precipitation to concentrate glycyrrhizic acid from the water extract is effective (Lu et al., 2006) and is a standard procedure recommended by the US Food and Drug Administration (CFR Title 21, Sec. 184.1408 Licorice and licorice derivatives).\n\nThe identity of the water extract was characterized by HPLC profiling for glycyrrhizic acid and liquiritin as specified in Chinese Pharmacopeia. A BosChroma ODS-AQ column (4.6 \u00c2 150 mm, 5 mm particle size) and Acetonitrile-H 2 O containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (32:68) as a mobile phase were used. The components were monitored at 248 nm under a UV detector. Ammonium glycyrrhizate and liquiritin were used as standards for HPLC studies.\n\nVero cells in triplicate or duplicate were infected with EV71 or CVA16 virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.3. To test the inhibitory effect of a compound, a stock solution of a testing sample in PBS or in DMSO or solvent control (DMSO at 0.1%) was added to Vero cells for 2 h before infection. The compound was left in medium throughout the infection assays. The cytopathic effect caused by virus infection was quantitatively measured using MTT assay (Mosmann, 1983) at approximately 72 h postinfection (PI). An inhibition rate was calculated as a percentage of (OD treated \u00c0 OD infected ) over (OD uninfected \u00c0 OD infected ). Alternatively, the cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.5% crystal violet prior to photograph with a digital camera.\n\nFor secondary infection assays, Vero cells were pretreated with or without an extract or GA for 2 h and then infected with CVA16 or EV71 at an MOI of 0.3. The cells and culture supernatants were collected at 48 h PI and freeze-thawed in liquid nitrogen to release infectious virus. Series-dilution of the supernatants was tested on Vero cells as described (Liu et al., 2011) . The TCID 50 numbers were calculated using the method of Reed and Muench (1938) and the plaque forming unit (PFU) numbers were calculated after enumeration of the samples with 10-100 plaques.\n\nIn time-of-drug addition experiment, Vero cells were infected with CVA16 or EV71 at 0.3 MOI. GA at 5 mM was added at 2 h prior to infection, during the infection or at varying times post infection. GA was left in the medium throughout the infection assay. The cytopathic effect was determined by measuring cell viability using MTT assay at 72 h PI.\n\nVirucidal activity assay was carried out to determine whether GA directly inactivated the viruses, CVA16 or EV71 was resuspended in 100 ml culture medium, and treated with GA at 0, 3, and 5 mM in a 37 1C water bath for 60 min. Aliquots of 10 ml treated virus were used to infect Vero cells (MOI was at 0.3, but final concentrations of GA were at 0.03 and 0.05 mM). The samples were harvested at 48 h PI for titration of infectious viruses with a secondary infection assay.\n\nVero cells were infected with EV71 at an MOI of 0.3 or 1.0 for 48 h in the presence or absence of GA. The cells were lysed by a lysis buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% NP-40, and a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Roche). The cell lysates were then subjected to separation by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore). EV71 VP1 in the samples was detected by incubation with an antibody against VP1 protein, followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and ECL reagent kit. GAPDH was used as a loading control. The images were captured using Alpha Innotech Flour Chem-FC2 imaging system (San Leandro, CA).\n\nThe maximum non-cytotoxic concentrations of testing compounds were determined on Vero cells by incubating Vero cells with a testing compound at varying concentrations for 72 h. The maximum non-cytotoxic concentration was defined as that at which no significant reduction of cell viability was determined by MTT assay.\n\nTo investigate the antiviral effect of Glycyrrhiza uralensis, water extracts of Glycyrrhiza uralensis were prepared and tested for their antiviral activity against EV71 and CVA16 infections in cell culture system. The quality of the extracts was validated by HPLC analysis (Fig. 1) . The content of GA and liquiritin in the extract used for antiviral studies was determined at 3.20% and 0.75%, exceeding the specified amounts in Chinese Pharmacopeia. When tested for its antiviral activity, we found the extract at 300 and 1000 mg/ml, but not 100 mg/ml, significantly blocked the cytopathic effect caused by CVA16 and EV71 infections. At 300 and 1000 mg/ml, the extract blocked CVA16 infection by 31.7%74.4 and 46.8% 75.1, respectively ( Fig. 2A) . The anti-EV71 effect of the extract was less potent but became significant at 1000 mg/ml. In addition, the antiviral activity was verified with secondary infection assays to titrate infectious virion production in samples treated with 1000 mg/ml of the extract.\n\nMore than a log less of infectious virions in those samples were detected ( Fig. 2B and C) , indicating the water extract of Glycyrrhiza uralensis possessed antiviral activity.\n\n3.2. The water extract is devoid of antiviral activity after depletion of GA by acid precipitation\n\nWe therefore focused our attention on the identification of antiviral components in the water extract of Glycyrrhiza uralensis. The chemical components of Glycyrrhiza spp. have been well investigated and are relatively clear. Plants in the genus contain triterpenoid saponins such as glycyrrhizic acid, dihydroflavonoids like liquiritin, and polysaccharides (Asl and Hosseinzadeh, 2008) , with GA as the principal component for antiviral activities. GA has three carboxylic acid groups and can be selectively precipitated by acidification of an aqueous solution. To preliminarily determine whether GA was responsible for Glycyrrhiza uralensis antiviral activity, we precipitate GA from water extract of Glycyrrhiza uralensis with H 2 SO 4 and detected the antiviral activity of precipitant and supernatant. Consistent with GA as an antiviral component, depletion of GA by acid precipitation obviated the antiviral activity of the extract (Fig. 3A and B) . As expected, the acidic precipitant which has GA content significantly enriched showed strong antiviral activity against both CVA16 and EV71.\n\nAt 200 mg/ml, the precipitant blocked infectious CVA16 and EV71 production by 2.2 and 1.7 logs, respectively, suggesting GA as a primary antiviral component of Glycyrrhiza uralensis.\n\nTo confirm whether GA was the active component of Glycyrrhiza uralensis against CVA16 and EV71 infections, we first have determined the maximum nontoxic concentration of GA in Vero cells was 7 mM. The antiviral studies showed that treatment with GA at 3 and 5 mM concentrations noticeably suppressed the cytopathic effect associated with CVA16 and EV71 infections at 72 h (Fig. 4A ). The inhibition of GA on CVA16 and EV71 infections was validated using secondary infection assays. As shown in Fig. 4B and C, as compared with untreated controls, treatment with GA at 3 and 5 mM resulted in reduced CVA16 production by 3.5 and 6.0 logs, respectively (Fig. 4B ). At the same concentrations, EV71 production was reduced by approximately 2.2 and 4.0 logs, respectively (Fig. 4C) . In contrast, 18b-glycyrrhetinic acid (b-GA) and liquiritin, components of Glycyrrhiza uralensis, at their maximum nontoxic concentrations (100 mM for b-GA and 300 mM for liquiritin, respectively) showed no antiviral effect (data not shown).\n\nThe inhibition of EV71 infection by GA was also confirmed by immunoblotting assay for EV71 VP1 protein production. As shown in Fig. 4D , GA at 5 mM blocked VP1 protein expression The cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde at 72 h PI and stained with 0.5% crystal violet. Inhibition of CVA16 or EV71 infection prevents cell death and hence increased staining compared infected but untreated controls. The results are representative from two independent experiments. (B, C) Glycyrrhizic acid treatment reduces infectious virion production. To assay for inhibition of virion production, Vero cells were treated with glycyrrhizic acid at 1, 3, and 5 mM or remained untreated. The cells were then infected with CVA16 (B) or with EV71 (C) at MOI \u00bc0.3. The samples were harvested at 48 h PI and infectious virions in those samples were assayed with secondary infection assays. Data are presented as mean 7standard errors of triplicate samples from three independent experiments. (D) Glycyrrhizic acid treatment inhibits VP1 protein expression of EV71. Vero cells were infected with EV71 in the presence or absence of glycyrrhizic acid at concentrations as indicated. The cells were harvested at 48 h PI and VP1 expression in the samples was detected by immunoblotting analysis. GAPDH was used as a loading control. The results are representative from two independent experiments. by more than 90%. The results together demonstrated that GA functions as an active component for Glycyrrhiza uralensis antiviral activity against CVA16 and EV71 infections.\n\nTo investigate the mechanism(s) of GA on inhibition of CVA16 and EV71 infections, we performed time-of-drug addition experiments to determine at what stages GA inhibited CVA16 and EV71 infections. As shown in Fig. 5A , pre-treatment or addition of GA within the first 60 min, but not at later stages of the infection, significantly reduced CVA16 caused cytopathic effect of Vero cells, indicating that GA potentially deactivated the virus or inhibited CVA16 infection by targeting an early event(s) of CVA16 infection. In contrast, pretreatment of the host cells or treatment within the first 12 h PI blocked EV71 infection to comparable levels, suggesting that GA inhibited EV71 infection by targeting an event(s) post cell entry by EV71.\n\nTo demonstrate if GA inactivated CVA16 directly, we performed virucidal activity assay. As shown in Fig. 5B and C, co-incubation of CVA16 with GA significantly reduced CVA16 infectivity, while the same treatment showed no effect on EV71 infection, demonstrating GA blocked CVA16 infection likely through direct inactivation of the virus. Kuo et al. (2009) have recently reported that a water extract of radices of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. possessed strong antiviral activity against EV71 infection. The IC 50 value was determined at 0.056 mg/ml. However, the components with such potent antiviral activity remain uncharacterized. In this study, we only detected moderate antiviral activity of the extract against EV71 and CVA16 infection. And we further demonstrated that GA contributed to the antiviral activity in Glycyrrhiza uralensis. In addition, GA is a signature component of Glycyrrhiza spp. and Chinese Pharmacopeia specifies its minimal content as 2.0%. It has been reported that GA contents in Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. from different cultivated areas varied significantly (Gu et al., 2002) . Consistent with this report, we found the contents of GA of five samples purchased from local market varied dramatically (data not shown). Therefore, we speculated that different GA contents and the cell lines may contribute to the discrepancy of reported activities of Glycyrrhiza spp. compared with our studies.\n\nThe use of Glycyrrhiza species for symptoms of viral respiratory tract infections can be traced back from ancient Chinese, Indian, and Greek manuscripts (Fiore et al., 2005 (Fiore et al., , 2008 (Pompei et al., 1979) . This report represents the first case of GA antiviral activity against nonenveloped viruses. A time-of-drug addition study revealed that GA inhibits CVA16 and EV71 infections through different mechanisms. The compound directly inactivates CVA16, while it inhibits EV71 infection apparently through an event post cell entry of the virus. Glycyrrhizic acid exhibits antiviral activity with multiple mechanisms, including direct deactivation of HSV-1 (Pompei et al., 1979) , reduction of host cell membrane fluidity (Harada, 2005) , inhibition of fusion of enveloped viruses (Wolkerstorfer et al., 2009) , impairment of hepatitis B virus surface antigen transport (Sato et al., 1996) , or disruption of RNA polymerase II pausing, resulting in loss of proper mRNA production and defects in sister chromatid cohesion (Kang and Lieberman, 2011) . Glycyrrhizin inhibits highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A virus infection and virus replication through its antioxidative effects in H5N1-infected cells (Michaelis et al., 2010 (Michaelis et al., , 2011 . The mechanism of GA inhibition of EV71 infection remains unknown.\n\nIt is worth noting that similar to reported concentrations for GA to inhibit virus infection, we found the concentrations required for GA to inhibit CVA16 and EV71 infections are also in the millimolar ranges. Animal and clinical studies seem to suggest that a therapeutic effect of GA can be accomplished at lower concentrations. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase I/II trial of chronic hepatitis C, intravenous delivery of glycyrrhizin at 80, 160, and 240 mg, thrice weekly, lowers serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) during the treatment, but no effect on HCV-RNA levels was detected (van Rossum et al., 1999) . Whether drug metabolism process or other factors play a role in GA activity is unknown, but physiological proteins (Lampis et al., 2001) or biological lipids (Lampis et al., 1997) are known to enhance GA activities.\n\nBoth CVA16 and EV71 are transmitted through close contact with blisters and other surface contaminated by nose and throat discharge of infected person, or via fecal-oral route. Glycyrrhizic acid as a food additive is considered safe consumed at high doses. A recent assessment on the safety of GA and its salts by The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel stated that those compounds are expected to be poorly absorbed through the skin (Andersen, 2007) . The ingredients are not considered to be irritants, sensitizers, phototoxic agents, or photosensitizers at the current maximum concentration of use. Therefore, the identification of GA with antiviral activity against HFMD pathogens may lead to the development of hygiene products."}
