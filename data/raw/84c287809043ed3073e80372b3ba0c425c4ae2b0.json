{"title": "", "body": "The Industry's Scope Travel and tourism in America has become big business. It is the business of trains, planes, and automobiles. Plus cruise ships, tourist attractions, hotels, restaurants, passenger railroads, motor coaches, tour companies, and much more. These components can be categorized into four major sectors: hotels, restaurants, transportation, and destinations/tourist attractions. Twenty years ago, the business of the industry was generally considered by the media to be \"soft\" or feature news. It conjured up travel poster images of children frolicking at Disney World, exotic destinations with swaying palm trees, fine dining at sunset, and bathing beauties basking in the sun on white, sandy beaches next to azure blue seas.\n\nThese images, of course, still prevail in travel and tourism brochures and advertisements. But today, the press takes the industry much more seriously. A fundamental reason for the change is that industry communicators have succeeded in convincing journalists that travel and tourism has a powerful impact on local and national economies. Stories that once were relegated to feature segments on television and in newspaper travel sections today regularly appear on \"prime-time\" business news segments and in the business sections of national publications because of the significant economic implications. In fact, TIA states on its Web site that travel and tourism ranks as America's third largest retail sales industry, is the nation's largest services export industry, and is one of America's largest employers.\n\n(See Appendix A for a list of travel and tourism professional/trade associations.)\n\nIn the Washington, D.C. area alone, travel and tourism accounts for 280,000 jobs, making it the area's second largest employment sector, according to city government officials. This area also is the home to nearly all of the industry's major professional and trade associations.\n\nAlthough most other nations have centralized, federal (usually ministerial-level) travel and tourism agencies, government support of the industry in the United States now comes mainly from the state, regional, and local levels. The industry's premier annual special event in the United States is National Tourism Week, during the second week of each May. This was established in 1983, when the U.S. Congress passed a joint resolution designating the week. In a White House ceremony the next year, President Ronald Reagan signed a Presidential Proclamation urging citizens to observe the week with \"the appropriate ceremonies and activities.\" Early on, USTTA and TIA took the lead in giving the event a national stage in the capital, but in 1986, industry leaders formed a permanent full-time office at TIA to sponsor the week and expand tourism awareness into yearround programs on the local level across the nation.\n\nIn addition to essential audiences such as employees, community leaders, and shareholders, many industry practitioners concentrate their PR efforts on these special publics: meeting planners, tour operators, CVBs, state/regional/local tourism offices, and travel agents. The travel agent segment in recent years has undergone significant restructuring due to the proliferation of online reservation networks such as Travelocity, Expedia, and Orbitz. These have provided enormous competition for travel agencies-especially in the airline field where all air carriers over the past decade have dropped the 10 percent commissions they used to remit to travel agencies for bookings. These changes have led to the closing of many \"mom and pop\" agencies and to the consolidation of many others. Still more agencies have had to reinvent themselves by charging service fees, developing niche businesses, and expanding trip advisory services. Agents continue strong relationships with the hotel, cruise line, and tour operator communities. (See Sidebar 1-3 for a list of the ten largest travel agencies.)\n\nBesides increased business media interest, another major contributing factor to the growing prominence of travel industry PR has been the explosion over the past 20 years of news media outlets dedicated to covering travel and tourism. For example, on cable TV, CNN devotes considerable time to industry news, and now there are cable channels exclusively devoted to travel and food. Every Friday, USA Today, America's largest circulation daily newspaper, publishes an extensive travel section, and national newspapers such as The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times have also expanded their weekly coverage of travel and tourism. In the magazine sector, influential publications such as Conde Nast Traveler (circ. 779,081) and National Geographic Traveler Giving increased impetus to the proliferation of PR throughout travel and tourism in recent years has been the explosive growth in technology, in particular the Internet and the emergence of hundreds of new channels on cable TV. It used to be that most media outlets worked a typical nine-to-five daily weekday schedule, with only spotty weekend coverage. The changes cited have put many news distribution outlets on a 24 /7 schedule. This has necessitated increased availability of travel and tourism spokespeople as news organizations scramble to fill time and space gaps on an around-the-clock basis.\n\nAnother factor contributing to the importance of industry PR has been the urgent need for effective communications management to meet the critical global crises that have arisen in recent years such as the threats of terrorism in the post-9 / 11 era and the outbreaks of If you are planning a press event in a country like Germany, it helps to know what the press does and does not respond to in this nation. Don't be surprised after making your announcement and call for questions not to get a single raised hand. This can be awkward and even embarrassing, but it can also be avoided. It helps if you know a particular reporter to ask if he or she will start things off by posing a question. This can evoke a few more so the whole press conference does not seem like a waste of time.\n\nEven better, don't ask for questions and arrange one-on-one interviews after the event, so each reporter can get his or her own \"scoop.\" In Germany, holding a press event in English is acceptable, since most speak and understand English. However, in one-on-one interviews, it is helpful to have someone on hand who can translate the difficult questions from English into German. Make sure you are offering substance, not fluff, and the facts to back up your information.\n\nThe German travel media are notable for ignoring promotional approaches, instead looking for detail, backed by hard research.\n\nWhen dealing with the Asian media, the same reticence to ask questions at a press conference is not unusual. In this part of the world, especially Japan, the language barrier can be a problem. Any announcements or events in Asian nations, except for Singapore and Hong Kong, require press materials to be translated and for native language speakers to be available at any interviews. This is for your protection-nuances between English and foreign languages can result in a totally different story than anticipated. In the 1980s when the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration launched a global advertising campaign, it was decided that America would be promoted to foreign visitors by using the slogan \"America Catch the Spirit.\" When translated into Japanese, the words meant something ghostly and the campaign was criticized as being culturally insensitive.\n\nAs magazines like Conde Nast Traveler, the (U.K.) Tatler, and Travel & Leisure launch more international editions, a world of new opportunities for promotion of hotels, airlines, cruise ships, and attractions has opened. Many editors are receptive to visits in their offices, as long as PR people come equipped to talk about what is new and different about their product, and the pitch is appropriate to the culture of a country.\n\nAs an example, before visiting any of the growing number of travel publications in the Middle East to promote a resort spa, 3. Issue initial statement; show compassion for victims and tell how your organization is responding.\n\nHave one designated spokesperson.\n\nHave a crisis center and set up action teams.\n\nHave prototype news releases ready to fill in and issue.\n\nUpdate corporate Web site with latest crisis info and background info.\n\n8. Set up 800 telephone number for special audiences.\n\nHold daily press briefings near crisis scene. Keep all other key audiences updated daily-employees, environmentalists, and government representatives.\n\n10. Dispatch PR representatives to crisis center and scene, and ensure they all have best telecommunications equipment to speak with each other and to other key organization executives.\n\nSince the beginning of modern PR at the start of the 20th century, practitioners have struggled with defining what they do. Several times the PRSA has attempted to have its membership settle upon a concise explanation-without success. To facilitate discussion of the field in this book, the following author's composite definition is recommended:\n\nThe management staff function that uses truthful two-way communications and operates in the public interest to influence public opinion in order to earn good will and understanding for the organization.\n\nThe PR practice entails the following strategic four-step \"RACE\" process that was first articulated by John Marston in his book The Nature of Public Relations: R = Research: Surveying existing literature and public opinion. A = Action: Strategic planning that includes setting objectives, benchmarks, and timelines; message crafting; campaign/program design (including logos and slogans); and budget estimates. C = Communication: Targeting specific audiences or publics; selecting key messages; identifying the most appropriate news media; and selecting the most effective PR tools and audiences (the principal PR framework for this textbook). E = Evaluation: Measuring the success of your efforts against the original objectives.\n\nPublic relations is both a practice and a profession. It is a practice for all those engaged in its activities. According to the strictest literal interpretation, however, a \"PR professional\" is a practitioner who is pledged to adhere to a code of ethics dictated by the membership requirements of peer groups such as the PRSA or the International Association of Business Communicators (IABC), and who has been certified by those groups by passing their accreditation examinations. This in no way is meant to imply that practitioners are incapable of producing professional results. Public relations is not merely publicity. The latter is a component of the communications step of the practice that is aimed strictly at gaining media attention, while PR encompasses the four-step process of the practice and entails extensive strategic planning and communications to a variety of publics. Another key component in modern PR is aimed at relationship-building with those publics.\n\nPublic relations should not be confused with propaganda. The latter involves the manipulation of public opinion through the use of half-truths usually in a controlled or censored environment. By contrast, PR is truth-based and thrives in open societies.\n\nPublic relations is also a discipline distinctively different from marketing and advertising. Marketing is totally sales-oriented and concerned mainly with one public-customers. PR is more broad-based and embraces many targeted publics. Organizationally, advertising traditionally has been a component of marketing.\n\nAdvertising is the placement of controlled, paid notices aimed at customers or potential customers, and it lacks the essential credibility that PR messages achieve through the third-party endorsement of the news media.\n\nModern public relations traces its origins back over 100 years to the dawning of the 20th century. The advent of PR occurred at the height of the Industrial Age in American history. \"Big business\" was the principal employer of the earliest practitionersbusinesses such as America's maturing mining, oil, railroad, and utility companies, which at the time were often confronted with significant labor strife and with the exposure of business abuse scandals in the press. Based in New York City, the society has 116 chapters across the United States. PRSA's membership participates in 17 special interest sections that include travel and tourism, food and beverage, association, corporate, international, and counselors' academy (agencies). There are also student chapters at 243 colleges and universities that offer PR studies. The society administers a member accreditation program and an annual awards program, oversees professional ethics, operates a professional resource center, conducts various professional development programs, and publishes for members a magazine, newspaper, and electronic newsletter.\n\nDespite the sharp distinctions between the two disciplines, the role of PR in the corporate structure often is to supplement marketing efforts. This has proved a very effective alliance in many instances. Regrettably, over the past decade, PR's distinctive identity has become somewhat blurred by the frequent merging of its name into the traditional corporate marketing functions of advertising, pricing, distribution, sales promotion, corporate identification, and demographic research. Prompting this change were the periodic economic downturns that occurred in the 1990s during which PR had a more difficult time justifying its goodwill benefits for companies, compared to marketing's ability to directly demonstrate its contributions to the bottom line. An unfortunate result of this merger activity was marketing's penchant to rename PR as \"marketing public relations\" or make PR a part of the newer term \"integrated marketing communications.\"\n\nLooking past this professional rivalry, however, the fact remains that PR's value has intensified since this merger trend with marketing began. For example, in their 2002 book The Fall of Advertising and the Rise of PR, branding experts Al and Laura Ries stressed the superior performance of PR versus advertising in launching new products. The fact of the matter is that as part of the marketing environment, PR has given marketing a significant boost in terms of the following factors: building awareness and credibility; holding down sales promotion costs; stimulating sales forces; influencing target groups; and defending products that have encountered public problems.
