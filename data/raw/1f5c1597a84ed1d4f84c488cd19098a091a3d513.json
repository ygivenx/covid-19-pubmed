{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Asymptomatic carrier state, acute respiratory disease, and pneumonia due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2): Facts and myths", "body": "In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia due to unknown cause occurred in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread throughout the country within 1 month. The pathogen of this disease was confirmed as a novel coronavirus by molecular methods and was initially named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV); however, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a new name on February 11, 2020 for the epidemic disease: Corona Virus Disease . To date, COVID-19 has affected people in more than 28 countries/regions, including Taiwan, and has become a global threat. [1] [2] [3] [4] In addition, the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has renamed the virus, which was provisionally named 2019-nCoV, as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on phylogeny, taxonomy, and established practice. 5 Prior to this, on January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak as the sixth public health emergency of international concern; therefore, this outbreak constitutes a public health risk through the international spread of disease and requires a coordinated international response. Increased dissemination of information through use of the internet is associated with increased transmission of information from all geographical regions and 4 across disciplines regarding recognition of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 6 ; nevertheless, important factors associated with COVID-19, specifically age and sex distribution, incubation period, clinical features, and optimal treatment, remain uncertain. Therefore, herein, we performed a literature review, focusing on the epidemiological characteristics and clinical manifestations of COVID-19, including asymptomatic carrier state, acute respiratory disease (ARD), and pneumonia.\n\nCOVID-19 was defined as the respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in China in 2019\n\n(https://www.who.int/westernpacific/emergencies/covid- 19) .\n\nThe clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are protean, which include asymptomatic carrier, ARD, and pneumonia of varying degrees of severity. First, asymptomatic cases were diagnosed based on positive viral nucleic acid test results, but without any COVID-19 symptoms, such as fever, gastrointestinal, or respiratory symptoms, and no significant abnormalities on chest radiograph 7, 8 However, the transmission of COVID-19 through asymptomatic carriers via person-to-person contact was observed in many reports. 4, 7, 9, 10 According to the recent China CDC report, 8 12.0% (n = 5,326) of patients were aged \u2265 70 years. Regarding children with COVID-19, nine (0.9%) patients aged 0-14 years were found in only one study, 11 while 14 (0.35%) patients were aged \u2264 10 years in another study. 15 The largest study in China showed that 0.9% (n = 416) of patients were aged <10 years. 8 Further, Wei et al.\n\nreported that nine infants under 1 year of age were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in China. 8 Regarding patient sex ratio, male sex comprised more than half of the cases in most COVID-19 studies [11] [12] [13] [14] and the proportion of males ranged from 51.4% to 73.2%. 8, [11] [12] [13] [14] 16 Initially, approximately half of the cases had Huanan seafood market exposure and animal-to-human transmission was suspected. 12, 13 However, fewer cases had exposure to this seafood market and an increasing number of cases demonstrated human-to-human transmission. 11, 17 Fortunately, no evidence was found for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who contracted COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy. 18 In addition to family cluster infections due to human-to-human transmission, 19 nosocomial spread of SARS-CoV-2 is a serious concern. Indeed, one study in a Zhongnan hospital of the Wuhan University showed 29.0% (n = 40) were medical staff and 12.3% (n = 17) contracted COVID-19 during hospitalization. 14 Two other studies showed that 2.1% (n = 23) and 3.8% (n = 1,716) of patients were health workers. 8, 11 \n\nAlthough the risk factors of COVID-19 remain unclear, many studies reported that a significant proportion of patients had underlying conditions. 8 Finally, at least 20% of COVID-19 cases had underlying diseases, and more severe cases were more likely to have comorbidities than non-severe cases.\n\nIt is essential to know the incubation period, the time elapsing between the moment of exposure to an infectious agent and the appearance of signs and Furthermore, patients with pneumonia were older, with a higher prevalence of smoking history, more underlying diseases, and were more likely to have fever, myalgia/fatigue, dyspnea, headache, and nausea/vomiting compared to patients with ARD (all p < .05) ( Table 3 ). In addition, pneumonia cases presented a higher white blood cell count and neutrophil count, but had a reduced leukocyte count compared to ARD cases.\n\nSerum procalcitonin levels of \u22650.5 ng/mL were found in 6.1% (6/99), 12 7.7%\n\n(3/39), 13 to 13.7% (16/117), 11 among SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients reported from three studies. [11] [12] [13] Moreover, patients with pneumonia were more likely to require oxygenation therapy, mechanical ventilator, renal replacement, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and received more antibiotics and antiviral therapy than patients with ARD. Finally, pneumonia was associated with a higher mortality rate than ARD (p <.0001).\n\nBased on the findings of 1,099 ARD cases of COVID, only 14.7% (n = 162) of patients had an abnormal chest radiograph. 11 In contrast, 840 (76.4%) patients had abnormal and diverse chest CT images, in which ground-glass opacity (GGO) was the most common abnormality (n = 550, 65.5%), followed by local patchy shadowing (n = 409, 48.7%), and interstitial abnormalities (n = 143, 17.0%). In addition, 505 (50.1%) had bilateral involvement. 11 The predominance of GGO and bilateral involvement in chest CT is consistent with previous studies. [24] [25] [26] In contrast, other types of abnormalities, such as cavitation, pleural effusion, and lymphadenopathy, were not found. 24, 27 As the disease progressed, follow-up CT showed enlargement and consolidation of single GGO, an enlarged fibrous stripe, and solid nodules. In contrast, a small fibrous stripe, as well as the resolution of GGO, may be associated with improvement in the patient's condition. 28 \n\nAccording to WHO reports, the overall mortality rate for COVID-19 was 2.9%\n\n(2247 in 76,769), 1 however, the mortality rate varied among studies. Initial studies reported that the mortality rate associated with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia ranged from 11% 12 to 15%, 13 but later studies revealed that the mortality rate was between 1.4% 11 and 4.3%. 14 The differences in the results among different studies could be due to the study population, as well as the differences among the studies in terms of disease severity. In addition, these results need further clarification, since a majority of the reported mortality was all-cause mortality, not COVID-attributed mortality; also, the outcome measurement was incomplete because many patients remained hospitalized before publication of the results.\n\nSeveral prognostic factors of COVID-19 were also reported in these studies. In one study using the MulBSTA score system, 46 which includes six indices, namely multilocular infiltration, lymphopenia, bacterial co-infection, smoking history, hypertension, and age, revealed that these indices were poor prognostic factors. 12 Another study showed similar findings, and specifically the indicators of disease severity, including oxygenation, respiratory rate, leukocyte/lymphocyte count, and the chest imaging findings,\n\nwere associated with a poor clinical outcome. 11 Moreover, a substantially 18 elevated case-fatality rate included the following patient characteristics: male sex, \u2265 60 years of age, baseline diagnosis of severe pneumonia, and delay in diagnosis. 15 Similarly, the China CDC reported that patients aged \u2265 80 years had the highest case fatality rate, 14.8%, among different age groups, and the case fatality rate of patients in which disease severity was critical was 49.0%. 8 Together, these findings suggest that old age and increased disease severity could predict a poor outcome.\n\nIn this stage of lack of effective drugs, the implementation of infection control interventions and traffic control bundle to effectively limit droplet, contact, and fomite transmission is the only way to slow the spread of the SARS-CoV-2. These infection control interventions include early identification of cases and their contacts, avoiding close contact with people with airway symptoms, appropriate hand washing, and enhanced standard infection prevention, and control practices in the healthcare setting. 47, 48 Uncertain issues\n\nAlthough information on COVID-19 has increased rapidly since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, many issues remain unresolved. First, the clinical manifestation of COVID-19 ranges from the asymptomatic carrier 19 state to severe pneumonia; however, most early reports only showed the findings of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, in which the ratio of male patients was much larger than that of female patients, there were no pediatric cases, and the mortality rate was high. [12] [13] [14] Subsequent to the publication of the studies of patients with only ARD or mild pneumonia, we found the ratio of male-to-female patients decreased, children or neonates could contract COVID-19, and the mortality rate declined compared to that of previous reports. 8, 11 However, whether children were less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, or their presentation was mostly asymptomatic or difficult to detect, remains unclear. 49 In addition, most studies, especially those with a large patient population, were conducted in China, and the study of asymptomatic carriers was limited. More studies are needed to clarify the epidemiologic characteristics of COVID-19 and to identify the risk and prognostic factors of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Second, Zou et al. reported that the viral load detected in asymptomatic patients was similar to that found in symptomatic patients; however, the viral loads from patients with severe diseases were higher than those in patients with mild-to-moderate presentations. Moreover, higher viral loads were detected in the nose than in the throat. 50 As there is a concern of virus spread due to severe cough 20 induced by performing a throat swab, nasal swab may be a relatively safe and sensitive alternative to collect the respiratory specimen of patients with COVID-19. However, this study involved a population of only 18 patients, including one asymptomatic patient. 49 In addition, every test has its own limitation and sensitivity/specificity; however, the studies investigating the \n\nThis \n\nThe author declares no conflict of interests "}
