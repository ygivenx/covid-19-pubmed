{"title": "Article Dimeric Structure of Pseudokinase RNase L Bound to 2-5A Reveals a Basis for Interferon-Induced Antiviral Activity", "body": "In higher vertebrates, RNase L is a principal mediator of the interferon (IFN)-inducible antiviral state that can determine survival of animals infected with highly pathogenic viruses (Zhou et al., 1993 (Zhou et al., , 1997 . Virus-infected cells produce and secrete type I IFNs that bind to the cell-surface receptor, IFNAR, initiating JAK-STAT signaling to many IFN-stimulated genes (ISG), including 2 0 ,5 0 -oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetase (OAS) genes (reviewed in Kristiansen et al. [2011] ; Stark et al. [1998] ). OAS1-3 proteins are pathogen recognition receptors for the viral pathogen-associated molecular pattern, double-stranded (ds) RNA (reviewed in Silverman [2007] ). Once activated by viral dsRNA, OAS uses ATP to synthesize a series of 2-5A molecules consisting of p 3 A(2 0 p5 0 A) n , n R 2 (Kerr and Brown, 1978) . The only wellestablished function of 2-5A is to activate RNase L. 2-5A binds to monomeric, inactive RNase L, causing it to dimerize into its active state and resulting in cleavage of single-stranded viral and cellular RNA, principally after UpU and UpA dinucleotides (Floyd-Smith et al., 1981; Wreschner et al., 1981) . The triadenylate form of 2-5A is the minimal active species; however, longer 2 0 ,5 0 -oligoadenylates, such as the tetraadenylate, retain the ability to activate RNase L (Dong et al., 1994) . Naturally occurring species of 2-5A contain three phosphoryl groups on the 5 0 -OH (Kerr and Brown, 1978) , although 5 0 -monophosphorylated 2-5A is capable of activating human RNase L in vitro (Dong et al., 1994) . RNase L contains, from its N to its C termini, an ankyrin repeat (ANK) domain, a pseudo-protein kinase (PK) domain lacking catalytic function (Dong and Silverman, 1999) , and a ribonuclease (RNase) domain, the latter two of which form a fused module homologous to the dual kinase-ribonuclease enzyme IRE1, a key effector of the unfolded protein response pathway (Walter and Ron, 2011) .\n\nCrystallographic analysis of a monomeric ANK domain fragment of human RNase L (Tanaka et al., 2004 ) provided a first view of a subset of molecular interactions required for binding to 2-5A. Subsequent analysis of the complete ANK domain revealed how concerted binding of 2-5A to two ANK domains can mediate dimerization (Han et al., 2012) . Whether the PK and RNase domains also participate in 2-5A recognition and how 2-5A induces dimerization of the ANK domain imposing a specific dimer configuration on other regions of RNase L remained open questions. The function of the pseudo-PK domain has remained largely uncharacterized, but early studies indicated a possible role for ADP or ATP binding in enzyme stabilization or activation (Dong et al., 1994; Wreschner et al., 1982) . In addition, a K392R mutation in the kinase ATP binding site of human RNase L (corresponding to residue 390 in porcine RNase L) resulted in greatly impaired RNase activity (Dong and Silverman, 1999) . Lastly, the RNase domain of RNase L shows sequence similarity to only the RNase domain of IRE1 (Korennykh et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2008) , and by inference, RNase L was predicted to share a common catalytic mechanism regulated by the imposition of a precise dimer configuration (Lee et al., 2008) .\n\nTo uncover the molecular basis for the regulation of RNase L antiviral function, we solved the 2.5 \u00c5 and 3.25 \u00c5 X-ray crystal and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) solution structures of near full-length porcine RNase L bound to a natural 2-5A activator with and without the ATP mimetic AMP-PNP. Together with mutational and functional studies performed in vitro and in vivo, these studies shed light on how RNase L recognizes 2-5A through concerted interactions involving the ANK domain and through an unexpected appendage to the pseudo-PK domain, and furthermore on how 2-5A recognition, together with nucleotide binding to the pseudo-PK domain, facilitates the imposition of a specific dimer configuration required for RNase catalytic function.\n\nX-Ray Crystal Structure of RNase L in Complex with 2-5A We identified diffracting crystals for porcine (Sus scrofa) RNase L (residues 21-732) lacking 20 N-terminal and 11 C-terminal protease-labile residues dispensable for enzymatic function . Crystals with the same space group, unit cell dimensions, and crystal packing arrangement were grown with natural 5 0 -triphosphorylated, 2 0 ,5 0 -triadenylate activator (2 0 -5 0 )p 3 A 3 in the presence and absence of the ATP analog AMP-PNP. Structures determined to 2.5 \u00c5 and 3.25 \u00c5 resolution, respectively, revealed a near-complete model of RNase L lacking only one N-terminal residue, three C-terminal residues, 11 residues comprising the ANK domain-PK domain linker, a four residue loop in the PK domain, and two and 19 residue loops within the RNase domain (see Table 1 for data collection and refinement statistics). Crystal packing arrangements and representative unbiased electron density centered on the 2-5A and AMP-PNP ligands are shown in Figure S1 , available online. A structure-based sequence alignment of RNase L and for comparison the dual PK domain-RNase domain catalytic module of IRE1, is shown in Figure S2 .\n\nSince the structures of RNase L in the presence and absence of AMP-PNP were near identical (rmsd = 0.5 \u00c5 ), we focused our analysis and discussion on the higher-resolution AMP-PNP bound structure. Four protomers of RNase L in the crystal asymmetric unit associate to form two identical (rmsd = 0.3 \u00c5 ) noncrystallographic dimers with each dimer engaging 2 mole equivalents of 2-5A and of AMP-PNP ligands (Figure 1 ). Easily recognized within each RNase L protomer are the ANK, PK, and RNase domains. As observed in the isolated ANK domain crystal structures of human RNase L (Han et al., 2012; Tanaka et al., 2004) , the ANK domain of porcine RNase L adopts a crescentshaped structure consisting of a stack of nine ankyrin repeats ( Figure 1B ), each possessing a characteristic loop-helix1-loop-helix2-loop architecture. Situated between ANK repeats 5 and 6 lies a noncharacteristic a-helical element (corresponding to residues 156-163) denoted a-AR8 0 ( Figure 1A and Figure S2 ). Largely disordered in the isolated ANK domain structures, helix a-AR8 0 features prominently in interdomain interactions.\n\nThe pseudo-PK domain possesses a bilobal fold with a smaller N-terminal lobe (N-lobe) and a larger C-terminal lobe (C-lobe) ( Figure 2A ). The N-lobe consists of a canonical five-strand antiparallel b sheet (denoted b1-b5) and flanking helix aC ( Figure S2 ). Grafted onto this common core, the first 36 ordered residues of the PK domain form a noncanonical appendage, with loop (L1)helix (aA)-loop (L2) topology, which features prominently in 2-5A activator recognition and in interdomain interactions. The PK C-lobe, which also deviates greatly from canonicality, is comprised of a three strand antiparallel b sheet (b5 0 , b7-b8), a two-strand b sheet (b6, b9), and seven a helices (aD\u00c0aI) Catalytic residues of RNase L are depicted as pink sticks, and IRE1 residues found at equivalent positions are colored beige. Disordered regions are shown as dashed lines, and the RNase L-specific helix a1 0 is shown in red. See also Figure S1 and Table 1 .\n\n( Figure S2 ). Positioned between b strand nine and helix aF (as shown for PKA in Figure 2B ) are the expected positions of the activation segment, helix aEF and the helix aEF-aF connecting loop, elements which serve phospho-regulatory and phosphoacceptor recognition functions in prototypical protein kinases (Nolen et al., 2004) . In the RNase L structure, this entire region is absent and substituted by a four-residue shunt, whose structure enables a nonstandard position of a split helix aG, an element also normally implicated in PK substrate recognition (Brennan et al., 2011; Dar et al., 2005) . Other distinguishing features of the PK C-lobe include uncommon substitutions at PK conserved positions Gln484, Gln481, and Asp502 (Lys, Arg, and Gly residues in IRE1, respectively) ( Figure 2C ). Together, these unconventional features of the kinase C-lobe likely account for the incompetence of RNase L as a PK enzyme (Dong and Silverman, 1999) . However, suggesting a critical role for nucleotide binding in the overall biological function of RNase L, a fully ordered AMP-PNP molecule is found coordinated by a full complement of PK invariant residues, namely, Asp482 (catalytic base), Asn487 (Mg 2+ coordination), Asp500 (Mg 2+ coordination), Lys390 (phosphate coordination), Glu402 (salt contact with Lys390), and Ala388 (contact with adenine base), within the kinase interlobe cleft ( Figure 2C ). The uncommon substitution of Gly for Asp at position 502 is notable for contributing additional interactions to a magnesium ion, which tethers the g-phosphate of AMP-PNP ( Figure 2C ). The binding of AMP-PNP gives rise to a rigid closed conformation of the PK domain, as evidenced by intact catalytic and regulatory spines ( Figure 2D ), features reflective of the active state of protein kinases (Kornev et al., 2008) . The absence of nucleotide in the AMP-PNP-free structure notably disrupts the integrity of the catalytic spine and leaves the kinase C-lobe relatively untethered from the N-lobe.\n\nExtending as a rigid protrusion from PK C-lobe is the RNase domain consisting of nine a helices (denoted a1, a1 0 , a2-a8, Figures 1A and 1C) with a 19-residue disordered sequence (residues 644-662, harboring a 12-residue porcine-specific insertion) between helices a3 and a4. Centered on helix a4 of each protomer at the base of a deep cleft formed by the dimerization of two RNase domains lies the ribonuclease active site with two copies composed in cis of an invariant tetrad consisting of Tyr663, Arg 675, Asn676, and His680 side chains and the conserved basic side chain of Lys672. Consistent with a shared catalytic mechanism for phosphodiester bond cleavage inferred originally from comparisons to tRNA ribonuclease (Lee et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2006) , the catalytic residues of RNase L adopt conformations and placements highly similar to those adopted by the corresponding residues of IRE1 ( Figure 1C ). In contrast, residues composing the surrounding solvent-exposed surface are completely divergent across paralogues with RNase L also possessing a unique helical insert (helix a1 0 ) lining the outermost edge of the catalytic cleft. This divergence of structure may account for the distinct RNA substrate repertoires of RNase L and IRE1.\n\nThe dimer configuration of full-length RNase L arises from the intertwining of two promoters through a 155 twisting action across the ANK domain-PK domain junction, which gives rise to the appearance of an exchange of ANK and PK domains between protomers. Crossprotomer contacts within the dimer are vastly greater than typical homodimers (Jones and Thornton, 1996) (total buried surface area = 7,894/7,102 \u00c5 2 , including/excluding 2-5A contacts, respectively) (Figures S2 and S3) and consist of (1) the antiparallel interaction of two ANK domains, (2) the parallel back-to-back interaction of the dual pseudo-PK domain-RNase domain modules, (3) crossprotomer interaction between the ANK and pseudo-PK domains, and (4) coordinated binding of two 2-5A activators, each engaging a composite binding pocket involving two ANK domains and the N-lobe of one PK domain.\n\nDimerization of the ANK domain is facilitated by a head-to-tail arrangement with concave surfaces facing inward (SA contact without 2-5A = 795 \u00c5 2 ) (Figures 1, S2 , and S3). In brief, ANK domain dimerization is mediated by the reciprocal interaction of ANK repeats 1-4 of one protomer with ANK repeat 9 of a second protomer at either end of the crescent shaped structure, similar to the interaction mode uncovered for the isolated human ANK domain bound to a synthetic 2-5A activator (rmsd between dimers = 2.1 \u00c5 , PDB ID 4G8L).\n\nBack-to-Back Interaction of the Dual Pseudo-PK Domain-RNase Domain Module Dimerization of the dual pseudo-PK domain-RNase domain module involves discontinuous contacts between the two kinase N-lobes (surface area = 1,478 \u00c5 2 ) and between the two RNase domains (surface area = 795 \u00c5 2 ) (Figures 3A, S2, and S3). Engagement of these two surfaces is coordinated by the rigidly fused junction between the PK C-lobe and the RNase domain arising from a contiguous hydrophobic core ( Figure S4A ), and by the binding of AMP-PNP to the pseudo-PK active site, which is predicted to constrain the inherent interlobe flexibility of the PK domain to a single closed conformation (Masterson et al., 2011) . Although only 3 (Tyr419, Arg675, and His680) of 27 back-to-back dimer contact residues on each protomer are conserved across paralogues ( Figure S2 ), the back-to-back dimer configuration of RNase L is highly similar (difference of 25 ) to that adopted by yeast IRE1 ( Figure S4A ). Back-to-back dimer contacts are primarily polar in nature and include a reciprocal salt bridge between Glu383 and Arg410 in the kinase N-lobes and between Lys603 and Glu683 and between Arg675 and Glu679 in the RNase domains ( Figure 3A , insets). Beyond this back-to-back dimer arrangement, no other packing arrangement of RNase L in the crystal environment bears resemblance to the helical polymer arrangement uncovered for IRE1 (Figures S1B-S1D).\n\nExcluding the covalent link mediated by the eight-residue disordered linker sequence, only a tenuous pi-stacking interaction (buried surface = 78.2 \u00c5 2 ) between Arg308 and Trp352 links the ANK and PK domains within each protomer (Figures 3 and  S4B ). In contrast, interprotomer interactions between PK and ANK domains within the dimer are extensive (buried surface = 1,588 \u00c5 2 ) ( Figures 3B, S2 , and S3). One set of interactions is mediated by the loop regions following ANK repeats 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 and by helix a-AR8 0 . These elements contact the top surface of the PK N-lobe, with helix a-AR8 0 engaging the G-rich loop of the PK domain through a hydrophobic interaction between ANK Ile162 and PK Cys427 and a salt interaction between ANK Asp158 and PK Lys368 . A second constellation of interactions is mediated by the noncanonical appendage of the PK N-lobe, which engages the loop regions linking ANK repeats 1-2 and 2-3. Included are three centered salt bridges between PK Asp364 , ANK Arg88 , and PK Glu366 and between PK Arg350 , ANK Glu55 , and PK His347 , and a hydrophobic interaction between ANK Trp58 , PK Ile351 , and PK Phe362 . A final set of interactions is mediated by the loop regions linking ANK repeats 5-6, 6-7, and 7-8, which form a constellation of charge-complementary interactions with the forward projecting end of PK helix aC and the b4-b5 linker, notably between ANK Arg 269 and PK Glu394 .\n\nThe 2-5A Binding Site The RNase L dimer engages two 2-5A activator molecules through symmetric pincer-like mechanisms with each 2-5A molecule binding to a composite channel composed by the two antiparallel aligned ANK domains and one PK domain (Figure 4A ). The channel mouth oriented inward to a large internal cavity between RNase L protomers engages the triphosphate moieties of Adenine 1 ( Figure 4B ), while the channel mouth oriented outward to solvent accommodates the untethered end of activators of length greater than three adenine residues ( Figure 4A ). Remarkably, within the tight confine of the channel center, virtually every functional group of 2-5A is engaged in molecular interactions with RNase L. Contacts with the two ANK domains bury 711 \u00c5 2 of the 1,167 \u00c5 2 total surface area of 2-5A and are similar overall to the contacts uncovered for a synthetic, monophosphate 2-5A analog in isolated ANK domain structures (Han et al., 2012; Tanaka et al., 2004) . Subtle differences in binding mode include a flip of the Adenine 3 base ( Figure S5 ) and the repositioning of the ANK Arg308 side chain to capture a pi-stacking interaction with PK Trp352 to form a clamp around the Adenine 3 ribose ring ( Figure 4A ). ANK repeats 1-6 of one protomer make extensive (SA = 529 \u00c5 2 ) contact with the back side of all three adenine residues while ANK repeat nine of the second protomer makes focused contacts (SA = 182 \u00c5 2 ) with the phosphate, sugar, and base of Adenine 3. Novel PK domain contacts covering 156 \u00c5 2 of 2-5A are mediated primarily by L2 of the PK N-lobe appendage, with the b and g phosphates of Adenosine 1 coordinated by a bifurcated salt interaction with the Lys164 side chain, which in turn is coordinated by a salt interaction with Asp424 in the b4-b5 linker of the PK domain (the latter is visible in Figure 3B ). Lastly, the phosphate moiety linking Adenine 1 and Adenine 2 is coordinated by a salt interaction with Arg353 in the PK N-lobe appendage and by van der Waals contacts with adjacent Pro354, Ile363, and Phe362 side chains.\n\nAnalyses of RNase L To probe the functional interplay between ANK, PK, and RNase domains and the importance of specific contacts, we pursued functional analyses of wild-type (WT) RNase L and a comprehensive panel of structure guided mutants (Figures 5, S6, and S7 ). We first investigated the effect of ligand binding on the oligomerization status of WT enzyme in solution using velocity analytical ultracentrifugation ( Figure S6A ). RNase L alone and in the presence of AMP-PNP was a monomer over the 0.5-10 mM protein concentration range tested. In the presence of 2-5A activator alone or with both 2-5A and AMP-PNP, RNase L was a dimer. These results with porcine RNase L are consistent with the behavior of human RNase L (Cole et al., 1997) . Using fluorescein-labeled RNase L, which enabled AUC analyses at nanomolar protein concentrations, we observed that AMP-PNP had no significant effect on the ability of RNase L to dimerize when already bound to 2-5A ( Figure S6B ). Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) with biotin-labeled 2-5A immobilized onto streptavidin sensor chips, we assessed the relative binding affinity of full-length versus an ANK domainonly fragment of RNase L. Consistent with the PK domain contributing direct contacts to 2-5A, full-length RNase L bound to 2-5A with $7-fold higher affinity than the isolated ANK domain (57 \u00b1 16 nM versus 376 \u00b1 10 nM, respectively) ( Figure 5A ). In the case of full-length RNase L, the presence of ATP had no significant effect on the ability to bind 2-5A ( Figures 5A and S7A ). We next assessed the effect of ligand binding on the RNase activity of WT enzyme at 1.6 nM concentration. In the absence of both or either of 2-5A and nucleotide ligand, no RNase activity was detected, whereas in the presence of both ligands robust RNase activity was observed ( Figure 5B ). We attribute the unanticipated strict dependency of RNase L RNase function on nucleotide (Dong et al., 1994; Wreschner et al., 1982) to the purity of our protein preparations (see Experimental Procedures). We also investigated the ability of RNase L to discriminate between nucleotides, since the RNase function of yeast IRE1 responds more potently to ADP than to ATP (Sidrauski and Walter, 1997) . We found that ATP, ADP, and, to a slight lesser degree, the nonhydrolysable analog AMP-PNP all potentiated RNase function ( Figure 5B ). Consistent with these observations, mutation of ATP-coordinating residues in RNase L that markedly reduced nucleotide binding ( Figure 5C ) also caused a major impairment to RNase enzyme function ( Figure 5D ). This impairment could be partially offset for some mutants by higher nucleotide concentration ( Figure S7B ). Consistent with the corollary finding, we observed that 2-5A did not potentiate RNase L binding to nucleotide ( Figure S7C ).\n\nHighlighting the functional importance of the parallel back-toback dimer configuration of the dual PK domain-RNase domain module, single or double mutations in the kinase domain (Arg410Glu) or in the RNase domain (Arg675Glu, Glu679Arg, Arg675Glu/Glu679Arg) greatly impaired RNase activity (Figure 5E) . Notably, these adverse effects were comparable to the loss of function displayed by the RNase catalytic tetrad mutant His680Ala ( Figure 5F ). Similarly, mutation of the sole cis interaction site between ANK and PK domains (Arg308Ala or Trp352Ala) caused great to intermediate loss of RNase function, respectively ( Figure 5G ). The difference in severity for the two mutations may in part reflect the different roles that each position also plays in directly contacting 2-5A (Figure 4) . Disruption of the ANK domain-PK domain interaction in trans by the single charge reversal substitutions Asp158Lys or Lys368Asp, by the double substitution Asp158Lys/Lys368Asp, or by deletion of helix aAR8 0 (D156-166) also potently dimin-ished RNase activity ( Figure 5G ). Lastly, Tyr310Ala, Lys164Glu, and Arg353Glu mutations affecting 2-5A contacts with each of the two ANK domains, and the PK domain, respectively, also perturbed RNase function ( Figure 5H ). Since all RNase L mutants tested appeared properly folded as assessed by elution volume during purification by size exclusion chromatography (data not shown), these in vitro functional studies support the notion that the dimer configuration visualized in a crystal environment reflects a functionally relevant form of RNase L in solution.\n\nTo determine the effects of different mutations on enzyme activity in intact cells, HeLa-M cells deficient in endogeneous RNase L were used (Xiang et al., 2003) . WT or mutant forms of porcine RNase L were transfected into HeLa-M cells for 24 hr prior to transfecting with the synthetic double-stranded RNA, poly(rI):poly(rC) (pIC), for an additional 3 hr. When introduced into cells, pIC activates OAS, causing production and accumulation of 2-5A, and activation of RNase L (Zhao et al., 2012) . To monitor RNase L activity in intact cells, total cellular RNA was isolated and separated on RNA chips (Agilent) (Xiang et al., 2003) (Figures 6A and 6B, upper panels) . The rRNA remained intact in control HeLa-M cells transfected with empty vector following by pIC ( Figures 6A and 6B, lane 1) . In contrast, WT porcine RNase L expressed in HeLa-M cells was strongly activated in response to pIC as determined by monitoring highly specific and characteristic discrete cleavage products of 28S and 18S rRNA from ribosomes (Silverman et al., 1983 ) ( Figures  6A and 6B , compare lanes 2 and 3 without and with pIC, respectively). Mutant RNase L lacking residues 156-166, an ANK segment interacting with both 2-5A and the PK domain, lacked ribonuclease activity ( Figure 6A, lane 4) . The Lys164Glu mutation of the binding site for natural 2-5A (through its b and g phosphoryl groups), showed reduced ribonuclease activity ( Figure 6A , lane 5). Mutant Tyr310Ala in the ANK 2-5A binding site was inactive, consistent with a prior report (Han et al., 2012) (Figure 6A , lane 6). Arg410Glu in the PK:PK interface was also defective for ribonuclease activity ( Figure 6A, lane 7) . Lys603Glu in the RNase:RNase interface had reduced activity ( Figure 6A , lane 8). RNase domain mutants Lys672Ala, Arg675Glu, and Glu679Arg were all defective ( Figure 6A, lanes 9-11) . ANK mutation Asp158Lys, a residue that forms a salt bridge to Lys368 in the PK domain, had reduced activity, whereas ribonuclease activity in the double compensatory mutant Asp158Lys-Lys368-Glu, that regenerates the salt bridge, was partially restored ( Figure 6A, lanes 12 and 13) . The latter result supports the functionality of the ANK:PK domain interface, although a partial recovery of function was not observed for a similar Asp158Lys-Lys368Asp mutant in our in vitro analysis. Five mutations in the ATP binding site of the PK domain were also evaluated for ribonuclease activity in intact cells ( Figure 6B ). Mutants Ala388Phe, Asp482Ala, Asn487Ala, Asp500Ala and to a lesser degree Glu402Ala all showed reduced activity ( Figure 6B, lanes 4-8) . Expression of the WT and the various mutant forms of porcine RNase L in HeLa-M cells occurred at similar levels as determined in western blots ( Figures 6A and 6B, lower panels) .\n\nTo determine if select mutations affect viral infections, WT or mutant forms of RNase L were expressed in HeLa-M cells followed by infection at an moi of 0.01 with the picornavirus, encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) (Hoskins and Sanders, 1957) . At 14 hr postinfection, cellular supernatants containing progeny virus were collected and titered by plaque assays on monolayers of L929 indicator cells to determine viral yields. Expression levels of the WT and different mutant RNase L proteins in the HeLa-M cells were similar as determined by western blotting (Figures 6A and 6B ; data not shown). WT RNase L reduced viral growth by about 12-fold ( Figure 6C ). In contrast, D156-166 (a segment in ANK that contacts both 2-5A and the PK domain), K164E (the binding site for natural 2-5A through its b and g phosphoryl groups), Arg410Glu (PK:PK interface), and Lys603Glu (RNase:RNase interface) were either not inhibitory to viral growth or minimally inhibitory, indicating these amino acid residues are essential for the antiviral activity of RNase L. . Viral yields were determined by plaque assays on L929 indicator cells. Data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SD from three biological replicates. ***p < 0.001; **p < 0.01; *p < 0.05; ns, not significant (when each group was compared to empty vector control [Vector] with two-tailed Student's t test).\n\nThese findings validate key features of the dimeric RNase L structure in the context of an ongoing virus infection. In addition, no significant inhibition of viral replication was obtained with ATP binding site mutants Ala388Phe and Asp500Ala. However ATP-binding site mutants Glu402Ala, Asp482Ala, and Asn487Ala retained a reduced ability to suppress viral replication when compared to WT RNase L ( Figure 6D ).\n\nAnalysis of RNase L To investigate the effect of nucleotide binding on the structure of RNase L in solution free of confounding crystal packing interactions, we employed SAXS analyses. The Rg and Dmax derived for the scattering data for RNase L bound to 2-5A was consistent with those expected from the crystal structure (see Table S1 for data collection parameters). The SAXS envelope resulting from ten independently generated ab initio models resulted in an elongated envelope with two distinct volumes. Superimposition of the crystal structure of RNase L onto this envelope using the supcomb program revealed that the ankyrin repeat domains and kinase N-lobes readily fit in the larger volume of the envelope and that the kinase C-lobes and RNase domains fit in the smaller volume ( Figure 7A ) (Kozin and Svergun, 2001) . In good agreement, the Porod-calculated molecular weight (195 kDa) is consistent with RNase L existing as a dimer in solution. We then collected SAXS data for RNase L bound to 2-5A in the presence of ADP and found the sample had smaller Rg and Dmax values (Table S1 ). The averaged SAXS envelope for this sample was also elongated but smaller in overall volume. Superimposition of the X-ray crystal structure of RNase L onto this envelope revealed a tightening of volume along the dimerization axis most pronounced in the region corresponding to the kinase C-lobe and RNase domains. These results are consistent with ADP causing a restriction of motion between the two protein kinase lobes.\n\nThe dimeric structure of RNase L in a complex with 2-5A and AMP-PNP provides mechanistic insight into a fundamental molecular event in antiviral innate immunity, activation of RNase L. The presented results are consistent with the following model for RNase L regulation and function ( Figure 7B ). In the absence of stimuli, RNase L is a catalytically incompetent monomer. In response to the binding of 2-5A ligands to composite binding channels involving two ANK domains and one PK domain and to the binding of nucleotide to the PK active site, full-length RNase L dimerizes into a single rigid body that juxtaposes the two dual PK domain-RNase domain modules in a parallel back-to-back configuration. Dimerization of the RNase domain composes the RNase active site, enabling the cleavage of RNA substrates to mediate an antiviral response.\n\nThe RNase L regulatory model displays interesting parallels to that of IRE1, the sole protein in eukaryotes to share a homologous dual PK-RNase domain module. In place of an ANK A B Figure 7 . Regulation of RNase L by 2-5A and Nucleotide Binding (A) Small-angle X-ray scattering analysis of the 2-5A-induced RNase L dimer in the presence and absence of ADP (see Table S1 for data collection statistics). Top panels display the ab initio-calculated molecular envelopes. Bottom panels show envelopes with superimposed RNase L crystal coordinates. (B) Schematic of RNase L regulation by 2-5A and nucleotide binding. 2-5A binding to RNase L through direct contact with the ANK domain and kinase N-lobe mediates molecular dimerization, while nucleotide binding to the kinase domain restrains the kinase domain to a single closed conformation required for the composition of the RNase active site. See also Table S1. domain, IRE1 possesses an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident luminal domain, which allows it to sense the accumulation of toxic misfolded proteins. The detection of misfolded protein transitions the ER luminal domain from low (n = 1 or 2) to high (n R 2) stoichiometric oligomers (Credle et al., 2005; Kimata et al., 2007) . Unlike RNase L, the dual PK-RNase domain module of IRE1 plays no role in the direct sensing of upstream-activating stimuli, and indeed the sensor and catalytic halves of IRE1 reside in separate organelle compartments, a feature which necessitates a less direct and precise mechanism for propagating dimerization/oligomerization signals. Lastly, the ability of the PK domain of RNase L to participate in stimuli sensing is supported by the evolution of a unique N-terminal lobe appendage not present in IRE1.\n\nAs a bona fide protein kinase, IRE1 also exploits its phosphotransfer function for autoregulation (Shamu and Walter, 1996) . Oligomerization of the ER luminal domain induces the close approach of cytoplasmic domains allowing trans autophosphorylation on sites within the PK activation segment, a modification integral to the ability of the dual PK-RNase domain module to sample a productive back-to-back dimer orientation (Lee et al., 2008) . RNase L, in contrast, lacks both the infrastructure to support phosphotransfer function and also the infrastructure (namely an activation segment harboring phosphoacceptor sites) to respond to autophosphorylation. In this respect, RNase L appears to have de-evolved to a structure akin to that of primitive atypical protein kinases such as Rio1 and Bud32 (Laronde-Leblanc et al., 2005; Mao et al., 2008) , which are similarly lacking in canonical C-lobe features. Despite a loss of phosphotransfer function, the ATP binding function of RNase L, like that of IRE1, is preserved, enabling the enforcement of a closed conformation of the PK domain required to assemble a dimeric and functional RNase module (Lee et al., 2008) . It remains to be determined, however, whether the absolute requirement of porcine RNase L for ADP or ATP extends to other species of RNase L.\n\nThe ability of IRE1 dimers to assemble into higher-order oligomers provides an additional level of control to promote RNase activity beyond that of minimal dimers (Korennykh et al., 2009 ). While a highly cooperative (hill coefficient > 4) dependence of RNase activity on enzyme concentration was interpreted to reflect RNase L also acting as a higher-order oligomer (Han et al., 2012) , we see no evidence of oligomer formation even at the high protein concentrations employed in our analytical ultracentrifugation and SAXS analyses. Instead, we reason that this behavior may be a manifestation of the dependence of RNase function on dimerization and the coordinated binding of four (two 2-5A and two nucleotide) ligands.\n\nIRE1 may act as a sensor of energy levels by virtue that its RNase activity is stimulated more greatly by ADP than ATP (Sidrauski and Walter, 1997) . This characteristic is not shared by RNase L. Since total cellular ATP/ADP levels are generally high (3-5 mM) relative to the high affinity of RNase L for ATP (0.6-1.2 mM), and are tightly regulated to remain constant, they would be constitutively available for binding to the PK domain of RNase L. These properties likely account for our observation that some ATP binding site mutants of RNase L that display near-complete impairment of RNase function in vitro at low ATP concentration display significant residual function in cells. It is thus likely that the RNase function of RNase L is regulated primarily by 2-5A levels. However, it is conceivable that as-yetundefined events or factors such as posttranslational modifications, cellular or viral protein products, or small molecules influence RNase function by modulating the ability of RNase L to interact with nucleotide.\n\nPrior studies have shown that RNase L is a potent inhibitor of viral infections that can be essential for controlling viral pathogenesis, for instance as shown for viral hepatitis caused by a murine coronavirus, MHV (Zhao et al., 2012) . While a number of different RNA and DNA viruses are susceptible to RNase L (reviewed in Silverman [2007] ), some viruses have acquired or evolved genes that antagonize the OAS-RNase L pathway at different levels, including preventing OAS activation by sequestering dsRNA (Xiang et al., 2002) , degrading 2-5A (Zhang et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2012) , or directly inhibiting RNase L (Sorgeloos et al., 2013; Townsend et al., 2008) . Viral antagonism of the OAS-RNase L pathway emphasizes the threat to the virus imposed by RNase L. Activation of RNase L also has profound effects on the cell by regulating innate immune signaling (Malathi et al., 2007) , autophagy (Chakrabarti et al., 2012; Siddiqui and Malathi, 2012) , and apoptosis (Castelli et al., 1997 (Castelli et al., , 1998 Zhou et al., 1997) . In addition, some human genetic studies have suggested that RNase L gene variants influence risk for different types of cancer, including hereditary prostate cancer (Carpten et al., 2002) , hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (Kr\u00fc ger et al., 2005) , and breast cancer (Madsen et al., 2008) . A better understanding of RNase L activation at a molecular level may provide insight into these different facets of RNase L biology. Indeed, in these studies we show that the PK-PK interface, RNase-RNase interface, and ANK and pseudo-PK domains that interact with 2-5A are all essential for the antiviral activity of RNase L.\n\nProtein Expression, Crystallization, and Structure Determination WT and mutant Sus scrofa RNase L proteins (residues 21-732 for crystallization studies and residues 1-743 for SAXS and biochemical studies) were expressed in Escherichia coli as TEV-cleavable GST fusions and purified by glutathione affinity, TEV cleavage, anion exchange, and finally size exclusion chromatography.
