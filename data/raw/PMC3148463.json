{"title": "Demographic, etiological, and histological pulmonary analysis of patients with acute respiratory failure: a study of 19 years of autopsies", "body": "Acute respiratory failure (ARF) is a major cause of death in patients with a variety of primary underlying diseases. In addition, the prevalences of comorbidities and mortality have been reported to be higher than 40-50% in ARF patients, especially in those with diffuse infiltrates as seen on chest X-rays.1-3 The clinical and radiological findings in ARF are nonspecific,4-6 and prompt investigation and diagnosis are essential to improving patient survival.7-9 In this context, the complexity of clinical presentations makes diagnosis a constant challenge for the clinician. Despite recent advances, most types of diagnostic support are still expensive. Clinicians often initiate treatment to avoid the rapid progression of the disease and to spare the patient from more invasive procedures. Therefore, it is important to determine the leading causes of death in this population to establish correct prophylactic actions, which is the least expensive strategy for preventing further pulmonary dysfunction and avoiding the need for lung biopsies.10\n\nWe performed a retrospective study of 4,710 autopsies on patients whose cause of death was ARF to better describe the demographic and etiological data and the associated histological pulmonary findings and diseases.\n\nThis study was conducted at a tertiary health care center. From 1990 to 2008, 26,560 medical autopsies were performed at this center, with an annual mean of 1,889. We examined the autopsies of the 4,710 (17.7%) patients in whom ARF was the cause of death. In 980 of these patients, the histological pulmonary findings could not be reviewed because the pulmonary tissue was not available (it was classified as \u201cwithout analysis\u201d); histological pulmonary analyses were performed in the remaining 3,730 (79.2%) cases. In this study, we reviewed all of the available microscopic and macroscopic diagnoses of death at autopsy, along with the patient medical records. The only inclusion criterion for the definition of ARF was based on arterial blood gases (PaO2<60 mmHg or PaCO2>50 mmHg with pH<7.30) while breathing room air.1-3 We excluded patients younger than one year of age and individuals not diagnosed with ARF.\n\nWe also obtained data regarding each patient's age, sex, and major underlying associated diseases (as determined at autopsy).\n\nThe clinical data from the patients enrolled in the study were collected with the approval of the Internal Review Board for this study, and informed consents were obtained from family members to perform the autopsies.\n\nAfter a complete review, the pulmonary pathological reports were categorized as follows:\n\n\u2022diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), which was defined as diffuse involvement and a uniform temporal appearance of alveolar collapse, hyaline membranes, obliterative fibrosis, neo-septal formation, and moderately organizing fibrosis;\n\n\u2022pulmonary edema (PE), which was defined as the accumulation of proteinaceous fluid in the alveolar spaces that gave the appearance of a granular, pink coagulate within such spaces;\n\n\u2022alveolar hemorrhage (AH), which was defined as the presence of blood in the alveolar spaces; and\n\n\u2022lymphoplasmacytic interstitial pneumonia (LPIP), which was defined as widened and edematous alveolar septa, usually accompanied by a mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes, histiocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils.\n\nAll the lungs were analyzed by microscopy, even when the medical records indicated the patient's diagnosis. The lungs were fixed in 10% formalin prepared in 0.9% saline for at least four weeks. We studied a minimum of five sections per lung for a total of ten sections per person, regardless of the presence or absence of morphologically demonstrable lesions. The paraffin-embedded tissue sections were assessed following hematoxylin and eosin staining. To document the presence and distribution of the wide spectrum of infectious agents and neoplasms to which this population was susceptible, we prepared a variety of special stains (periodic acid-Schiff staining, immunohistochemical analysis, fluorescence, Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast staining, Gram acid-fast staining, Mucicarmine acid-fast staining, and Gomori's methenamine silver acid-fast staining) for selected tissue sections. Bacterial bronchopneumonia (BBP) was defined as the presence of cell consolidation with polymorphonuclear leukocyte accumulation in bronchioles and adjacent alveoli. For the diagnoses of cytomegalovirus and fungal pneumonia, histological evidence of lung involvement was required, with or without tissue culture. Severe sepsis and septic shock were defined as sepsis with the addition of organ dysfunction or the clinical diagnosis of arterial hypotension, which may or may not have been responsible for the aggressive fluid resuscitation. The diagnoses of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and atypical mycobacterial infection were confirmed using fluorescence, the Ziehl-Neelsen techniques and a Lowenstein-Jensen culture. The proportion method and biochemistry were used to identify all of the positive cultures.\n\nThe descriptive analysis of the data included median, minimum, and maximum values. The probabilities (odds ratios) that patients with underlying diseases and comorbidities would develop specific pulmonary histopathological patterns and die of ARF-related pulmonary alterations were determined by logistic regressions. The independent variables included the following major diseases and/or comorbidities: BBP, cancer, liver cirrhosis, HIV/AIDS, acute myocardial infarction, systemic arterial hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, sepsis and septic shock, chronic kidney failure, and tuberculosis. All the statistical procedures were performed using the SPSS v10.0 statistical software. Statistical significance was set at a p-value of 5%.\n\nARF was described in 4,710 autopsies (17.7%) from 1990 to 2008. The patients' ages ranged from 1 to 99 years (with a median of 52). A total of 2,713 (57.6%) men and 1,997 (42.4%) women were included in the study. The demographic data are listed in Table 1.\n\nWe observed a single associated disease in 1,793 (38.0%) of the cases, 2 diseases in 1,505 (32.0%), 3 in 797 (16.9%), 4 in 349 (7.4%) and 5 diseases in 184 (3.9%) of the cases. A diagnosis could not be determined after autopsy in 82 (1.7%) of the cases.\n\nThe pulmonary histopathological analysis showed DAD in 40.7% (1,917) of the patients, PE in 23.5% (1,107), AH in 10.4% (491) and LPIP in 4.6% (215) of the patients. The pulmonary histopathological findings and the most prevalent diseases in the 4,710 patients are shown in Table 2.\n\nThe major underlying diseases and comorbidities in the ARF patients are shown in Table 2. BBP was present in 33.9% of the patients (1,597 cases) and was the most frequent pulmonary complication found at the time of autopsy. Cancer was the second most frequent complication; it was observed in 28.1% of the patients (1,324 cases), followed by severe sepsis and/or septic shock in 14.3% (675), liver cirrhosis in 13.6% (639), HIV/AIDS in 10.4% (490), pulmonary embolism in 9.0% (426), acute myocardial infarction in 4.7% (219), stroke in 4.4% (207), and tuberculosis in 2.2% (104 cases) of the patients. The main associated comorbidities were systemic arterial hypertension in 11.5% (541 cases), chronic kidney failure in 4.4% (207), diabetes mellitus in 4.1% (191), dilated cardiomyopathy in 4.0% (186), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 3.5% (164) of the patients.\n\nThe multivariate analysis, with the statistically significant associations between the most prevalent diseases/comorbidities and the different histopathological findings, is shown in Table 3.\n\nFirst and foremost, this was a retrospective study of medical records in which the quality of the information was inherently limited. The second limitation of our study is related to the interobserver variability, which is an issue even though all of the autopsies at our institution are performed by a resident pathologist and supervised by a senior pathologist, who also checks the histological analysis to prepare the final reports. Different observers can have different opinions; some studies have shown significant interobserver variability in about 15% to 35% of the autopsies analyzed.4,7 In addition, the accuracy of autopsy findings depends on the interest and skill of the pathologist.\n\nDespite recent advances in diagnostic technological, the autopsy has remained an important complementary tool for identifying and understanding diseases in ARF patients. BBP was the most common diagnosis in our ARF patients, followed by cancer. The most prevalent pulmonary histopathological pattern was DAD, which was associated with different inflammatory conditions.\n\nFurther studies are necessary to elucidate the complete pulmonary pathophysiological mechanisms involved in each disease and in the development of ARF."}
