{"title": "Detection and molecular characterization of feline hemoplasmas in wild felid species in Iran in the Middle East", "body": "Hemoplasmas are hemotropic mycoplasmal bacteria that infect a wide range of mammals [1, 2] . At least three feline hemoplasma species have been described in domestic cats including Mycoplasma haemofelis, 'Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum', and 'Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis' [1] [2] [3] [4] . The most pathogenic species is M. haemofelis, which can cause hemolytic anemia [5, 6] in immunocompetent cats. Coinfection of hemoplasmas with other pathogens such as feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) may worsen the severity of the hemoplasma-induced anemia and result in anemia following infection with less pathogenic hemoplasmas such as 'Ca. M. haemominutum', and 'Ca. M. turicensis' [7, 8] .\n\nHemoplasma infection with M. haemofelis, 'Ca. M. haemominutum' and/or 'Ca. M. turicensis' has been reported in around nine wild felid species worldwide [9] [10] [11] , with wildlife isolates showing near identity to those found in domestic feline species [9] . There are, however, only limited studies of hemoplasma infections in wild felids, and no studies have yet been performed in countries in the Middle East, such as Iran, and the natural transmission route for hemoplasmas is not known [9] .\n\nThe Persian leopard is an endangered wild felid, native to Iran and some neighboring countries. Following the extinction of the lion Panthera leo persica and tiger Panthera tigiris virgate in Iran, it is the only large wild felid now existing in Iran [12] [13] [14] [15] , and no studies have yet evaluated this species as a host for feline hemoplasma infection. We have recently reported the presence and molecular characterization of feline hemoplasma infections in domestic cats in Iran [16] , and the aim of this study was to document the presence and molecularly characterize of feline hemoplasma species in wild felids in Iran in the Middle East. K3E, Lot. F111332 2.5 mL tube, Torreglia, Italy) were obtained from the following cats; twelve African lions, four leopards (three Persian leopards and one African leopard), one Eurasian lynx, one Bengal tiger and one Caracal, using a blowpipe filled with a combination of drugs and dosage to each species; ketamine (3 mg/kg) and medetomidine (0.03 mg/kg) for Bengal tiger, Persian and African leopards, butorphanol (0.2 mg/kg), medetomidine (0.035 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.15 mg/kg) for Eurasian lynx and Caracal caracal and tiletamine/ zolazepam (1.5 mg/kg) and medetomidine (0.015 mg/kg) for African lion. These are given intramuscularly to anesthetize the animals followed by femoral vein sampling. Approval was granted for the study from the Iran Veterinary Organization since samples were taken as part of a national and international cooperative project for conservation of Persian leopards, supported by the Iranian Department of the Environment, the International Union for Conservation of Nature, The Wildlife Conservation Society and Panthera. The sampled animals were kept either in Tehran zoo or in the Tandoureh National Park. Tandoureh National Park has been protected since 1968 and is located in north eastern Iran and is around 355 km 2 in size. Signalment data for these wild felids, as well as their origin and current residence are shown in Table 1 .\n\nHematological parameters including white blood cell, red blood cell (RBC), Hematocrit (HCT), hemoglobin concentration (Hb), mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration and platelets were measured using an automatic hemocytometer (Hema-screen 18, Hospitex diagnostic, Florence, Italy). Blood smears were prepared for differential white blood cells count and examination for hemoparasites. Plasma was submitted for serological retrovirus testing for FeLV and FIV using a commercially available rapid diagnostic ELISA kit (Quicking FIV Ab + FeLV Ag Combined Test, W81099, China), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and were confirmed by repeat ELISA testing using a different serological retrovirus test (ELISA kit for serodiagnosis of FeLV and FIV Ab, Biopronix, Agrolabo, Italy).\n\nDNA was extracted from 100 \u03bcL whole blood from each sample using a commercial kit (QIAamp cador pathogen Mini kit, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), following the manufacturer's instructions, and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until further use.\n\nDistilled water and known positive blood samples for each of the three feline hemoplasma species, obtained from the School of Veterinary Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK and Bologna University, Bologna, Italy, were used as negative and positive controls respectively during each run of DNA extractions.\n\nA control conventional PCR to amplify a fragment of feline glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene was performed to detect possible PCR inhibitors in DNA samples [17] . Screening hemoplasma PCR analysis was performed using a previously described generic universal hemoplasma conventional PCR assay using 5\u2032-ATACGG-CCCATATTCCTACG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TGCTCCACCACTTGTTCA-3\u2032 as forward and reverse primers, respectively [18] .\n\nAll samples were then subjected to species-specific conventional PCRs for each of the three feline hemoplasma species using previously described conventional PCR assays [19, 20] . Positive controls of M. haemofelis, 'Ca. M. haemominutum' and 'Ca. M. turicensis' were used for both the generic haemoplasma and species specific PCRs.\n\nThe 16S rRNA gene of positive samples on generic screening hemoplasma PCR was amplified using primers 8F: 5\u2032-AGAGTTTGATCC TGGCTCAG-3\u2032 and 1492R: 5\u2032-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3\u2032, as previously described, with resulting PCR products then subjected to sequencing using the Sanger technique (ABI, 96-capillary XL) [21] . After evaluating the quality of sequence reading in Finch TV software (Geospiza), 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the forward and reverse sequence reading were trimmed. The forward and reverse sequences of each sample were then overlapped and aligned with available 16S rRNA sequences of 'Ca. M. haemominutum' in Genbank. Finally, partial 16S rRNA sequences of 1086 bp (lacking about 200 bp from each 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end of complete 16S rRNA sequence of 'Ca. M. haemominutum') were obtained. \n\nData analysis, including descriptive statistics, was performed using SPSS software (16.0 IBM, New York, USA). African lion hematology reference intervals were calculated using the mean \u00b1 SD data available in previously published work [22] , using the formula mean \u00b1 1.96SD. Sequence data analysis and phylogenic tree construction were performed with MEGA6 software using the partial 16S rRNA sequences derived in this study as well as other wild and domestic cat hemoplasma sequences downloaded from Genbank (Accession numbers shown in Fig. 1 ). Bootstrap testing (1000 replicates) and out-grouping were used to validate the phylogenic tree [23] . The evolutionary distances were computed using the Kimura 2-parameter method [24] and the Neighbor-Joining method [25] used for tree construction [26] .\n\nNucleotide Sequence Accession Numbers. The partial 16S rRNA gene sequences derived from this study were submitted to Genbank with accession numbers KU852586 and KU852587.\n\nOf the 19 samples analyzed, all were PCR-positive for GAPDH, and two (10.5%) were PCR-positive by generic universal hemoplasma conventional PCR. Only the same two samples were positive on speciesspecific PCR; both for 'Ca. M. haemominutum' only. All positive controls had expected amplified band in the generic universal and the species-specific conventional haemoplasma PCRs and distilled water as the negative control had none. Both of the positive samples were from old (14 and 15 years) male Persian leopards (Case numbers 13 and 14 in Table 1 ), from two different geographical areas of Iran. No hemoplasma organisms were observed on blood smear examination.\n\nThe two hemoplasma ('Ca. M. haemominutum') infected Persian leopards were both also FIV seropositive, and one African lion was also FeLV and FIV positive but not hemoplasma infected. No other samples were retrovirus positive.\n\nTo the authors' knowledge, no hematological reference ranges exist for Persian leopards, nor for any closely related species (e.g. African leopard, Arabian leopard), limiting interpretation of the hematology profiles of the Persian leopards in the current study. However, as shown in Table 2 , the hematology profiles of the two 'Ca. M. haemominutum' and FIV-seropositive Persian leopards (Case numbers 13 & 14) showed HCT, Hb, and RBC counts at the lower end of the reference range used for domestic cats, and HCT and RBC counts below the reference range calculated for African lions based on Larsson et. al. [22] , and were lower than those recorded in the non-infected Persian leopard (Case number 15). Thus it is possible that 'Ca. M. haemominutum' and FIV infection were associated with a reduction in erythrocyte indices in the infected cats, but further data from larger numbers of cats would be required to confirm this.\n\nThe hematology profiles of the 12 African lions were also compared to the reference range calculated for African lions based on Larsson et. al. [22] , and 11 of the 12 lions had HCT and Hb values within or above the reference range. The FeLV and FIV seropositive but hemoplasma PCR negative lion had a hypochromic normocytic anemia (HCT 20.7%). The four remaining cases (Case numbers 16, 17, 18 and 19) could not have their hematological profiles determined due to sample hemolysis.\n\nThe partial (1086 bp) 'Ca. M. haemominutum' 16S rRNA gene sequences derived for the two hemoplasma infected Persian leopards in the current study (KU852586 and KU852587) showed high sequence identity (97.7-99.45%) with, and were closely related to the 'Ca. M. haemominutum' sequences in Genbank derived from worldwide wild felids and domestic cats [9, [27] [28] [29] , including Iranian domestic cats. Data are shown in Fig. 1 \n\nThis study documents the presence of hemoplasmas in wild felids for the first time in Iran in the Middle East. It is also the first documentation of hemoplasma infection in the endangered Persian leopard species [12] . The prevalence of hemoplasma infection in wild felids has varied in different studies but is not frequently high. In a surveillance study in Brazil on neotropic and exotic felids, 9.2% of 109 felids were hemoplasma positive (all 'Ca. M. haemominutum') [30] , whilst in freeranging Cheetahs in Namibia, only one of 63 Cheetahs was positive [31] . However higher prevalence was reported in another study evaluating a large sample size (275) from worldwide geographical areas where prevalence of 18%, 32% and 20% were found for M. haemofelis, [27, [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . Fighting behavior is also regarded as a risk factor for hemoplasma infection [27, 36, 38] , although the fighting behavior of the cats sampled was not completely known and leopards (Panthera pardus) are generally not regarded as an aggressive species [39] . However, in the literature there are cases of intraspecific killing among leopards over a kill, territory or cannibalism, so aggression is possible [40, 41] . There are also two reports of intraspecific killing from Persian leopards in Tandoureh in 2007 and 2016 over food and territory (Memarian. I, personal communication).\n\nNeither of the two 'Ca. M. haemominutum' infected Persian leopards identified in the current study lived in zoos. As reported in an extensive study on feline hemoplasma infection in wild felid species worldwide [9] , free-ranging felids had higher hemoplasma infection prevalence [9, 42, 43] than captive felids. This may be because freeranging felids have more fighting and hunting habits and/or more exposure to vectors, than captive or zoo-based felids. In the same study described, a significant correlation between FeLV PCR positivity and hemoplasma infection was found in European wild cats [9] . There are several reports of retrovirus infections in free-ranging and captive wild felids [44] [45] [46] [47] , and multiple other concurrent infections such as feline calicivirus, feline herpesvirus, feline parvovirus, and feline coronavirus [42, 43] . In the current study both 'Ca. M. haemominutum' Persian leopards were FIV seropositive and this is, to the authors' knowledge, the first report for such a co-infection in a wild felid species.\n\nIt is not known if the 'Ca. M. haemominutum' infection in the Persian leopards caused anemia. This was difficult to assess since no reference ranges exist for hematological parameters in this species, and it is known that greater anemia can occur in cats with concurrent 'Ca. M. haemominutum' and retrovirus infection compared to 'Ca. M. haemominutum' alone [7] . The very small sample size did not permit a statistical comparison between 'Ca. M. haemominutum' FIV-seropositive and FIV-seronegative Persian leopards. Nevertheless, it was of note that the HCT, Hb and RBC counts of the two 'Ca. M. haemominutum' FIV-seropositiveleopards were lower than the Persian leopard free from hemoplasmas and retroviral infection, suggesting that coinfection of 'Ca. M. haemominutum' and FIV could have been associated with reduced RBC parameters.\n\nThe partial 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic analysis found that the 'Ca. M. haemominutum' isolates derived from this study were closely related to those from different geographical origins and from both domestic and wild felids. In a previous phylogenetic study of domestic feline hemoplasmas, using both 16S rRNA gene and RNaseP genes, almost 100% identity was reported between Europe, Asia, Africa and United States species [48] . In a Japanese study, the identities of the detected hemoplasma sequences was very high, such that it was not possible to assume the origin of M. haemofelis and 'Ca. M. turicensis' from endangered Iriomote cats. In agreement with our findings, previous studies describing feline hemoplasma phylogenetic analysis based on the RNaseP gene revealed similar close relationships between the hemoplasma species of both domestic and wild felids [9, 31, 48] .\n\nA limitation of this study is the small sample size, but despite this, it is interesting to note that two of the three Persian leopards tested were 'Ca. M. haemominutum' positive, suggesting that hemoplasma infection may be prevalent in this species, especially as the two positive Persian leopards were from geographically distinct areas.\n\nIn conclusion, we have documented that hemoplasma infections occur in wild felids and we have reported, for the first time, hemoplasma infection in wild felids in the Middle East and hemoplasma infection in Persian leopards. Interestingly the two 'Ca. M. haemominutum' infected Persian leopards were seropositive for FIV. The prevalence of infectious diseases in wild felids is difficult to assess and monitor but should be considered by those working to save endangered animal species such as the Persian leopard.\n\nThis research did not receive any grants from any funding agencies."}
