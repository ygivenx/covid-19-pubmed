{"title": "The Novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Directly Decimates Human Spleens and Lymph Nodes Running title: SARS-CoV-2 infects human spleens and lymph nodes", "body": "In December 2019, clusters of patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported by the local health facilities in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. 1, 2 In January 2020, the causative agent of mysterious pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO). This novel coronavirus was renamed as the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the consequent disease was designated as coronavirus disease 2019 . 3, 4 According to the daily report of the WHO, the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 has so far caused 81961 laboratory confirmed cases and 3293 death in China. Meanwhile, the number of confirmed COVID-19 and fatalities around the world are 465315 and 21031, respectively, by 26 th March 2020. 5 The importance of the secondary lymphoid organs, including spleen and lymph nodes (LNs), for resistance against infection is well established. Tissue-resident macrophages positioned in the splenic marginal zone (MZ) that are among the first cell types to encounter invading pathogens. 6, 7 Similarly, the resident macrophages of the subcapsular sinus and hilar lymph nodes have been shown to play a protective role against viral infections by capturing viral particles. 8, 9 These macrophages present viral antigens to activate specific T cells, to induce activation, clonal proliferation, and subsequent killing of infected target cells through secretion of perforin, granzyme B, and interferon-\u03b3 etc. [10] [11] [12] Moreover, these activated T cells also egress from spleen and LNs into blood circulation and play immune surveillance roles. 13 Unfortunately, our previous work has shown that lymphocytopenia is prevalent in COVID-19 patients, especially in aged and critically ill cases, suggesting that the immune system from COVID-19 patients might be neutralized by infection. 14 Therefore, understanding the destinies of lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid organs is critical for understanding SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, and the identification of methods to boost lymphocytes and enhance the host immunity in vivo.\n\nIn this report, spleens and LNs from six COVID-19 patients with postmortem examinations were collected. The virions in LNs were visually observed by transmission electronic microscope (EM) and pathological damage was analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Moreover, viral nucleocapsid protein (NP) antigen, cell apoptosis and proinflammatory cytokine expression were measured by immunohistochemistry.\n\n.

The corresponding authors were responsible for all aspects of the study to ensure that issues related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work were properly investigated and resolved. The final version was approved by all authors.\n\nImmunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of ACE2, the potential receptor for SARS-CoV-2, in 6 cases of spleens and hilar LNs from 6 autopsies as well as normal human tissues.\n\nResults showed that ACE2 + cells were observed in spleens and LNs from normal healthy and autopsies. In LNs, the expression of ACE2 is restricted on cells within medulla (Figure 1 A and C) ,\n\nwhereas ACE2 + cells are found in red pulp of spleens (Figure 1 B and D) , and tissues from autopsies have slightly higher levels of ACE2 + cells than normal controls. Here ACE2 expression in normal kidneys were used as positive controls (Figure 1E) , and sections without primary antibodies were used as isotype controls (Figure 1F) , demonstrating ACE2 + cells are positions in human spleens and LNs.\n\nWe next examined what kinds of cells are positive for ACE2, and immunofluorescent double staining showed that ACE2 expresses on CD68 + macrophages in LNs ( Figure 1G ). CD169 + macrophages are a subpopulation of tissue-resident macrophages positioned in the splenic marginal zone (MZ) where they encounter invading pathogens. 6, 7 In parallel, CD169 + macrophages also reside in the subcapsular sinus of LNs and have been shown to capture viral particles from draining LNs. 8, 16 Immunofluorescent double staining further illustrated that the ACE2 antigen is observed in CD169 + macrophages in the subcapsular sinus of LNs ( Figure 1G) . Collectively, these results demonstrated that ACE2 expresses on macrophages in spleens and LNs.\n\nWe next investigated the expression of viral NP antigen in secondary lymphoid tissues.\n\n.

In the spleen, viral NP + cells were primarily distributed in red pulp and blood vessels, although positive cells were also occasionally observed in white pulp. In lymph nodes, the NP + cells were seen in cells within marginal sinus of lymph nodules as well as capillaries, some positive cells are also found in germinal centers, and NP antigen was observed in cytoplasm, whereas nucleus is negative for NP expression (Figure 2A) .\n\nWe then performed addition staining to identify the LN cell types that are positive for viral NP antigen. Immunofluorescent double staining confirmed that the majority of NP antigen is found in ACE2 + cells and CD68 + macrophages, including cells in capillaries, while, neither CD3 + T cells nor B220 + B cells are positive for NP protein ( Figure 2B) . Moreover, immunofluorescent double staining also further illustrated that the viral NP antigen is observed in CD169 + macrophages in the subcapsular sinus of LNs ( Figure 2B) . Collectively, these results suggest SARS-CoV-2 infects macrophages, especially resident CD169 + macrophages in spleen and LNs.\n\nSince SARS-CoV-2 is known to be highly cytotoxic, its persistence in secondary lymphoid organs may well induce lymphocytopenia. To confirm this possibility, 6 hilar lymph nodes of 1.0\uff5e\n\n1.5 cm in diameter from 6 autopsies were collected and histopathological examination was performed by H&E staining. In contrast to normal healthy controls, the lymph follicles and paracortical areas in viruses-infected tissues are not identifiable, with necrotic and apoptotic lymphocytes being widely distributed, causing a significant reduction of total lymphocytes, including cells in T and B zones. Moreover, interstitial blood vessels had proliferated, expanded and were congested (Figure 3) . Similarly, the total lymphocyte counts are significantly lower in sections from viruses infected spleens, which were also dominated by lymphocytes undergoing necrosis and apoptotic. Moreover, the spleens were congested, hemorrhagic, and lacking lymphoid follicles.\n\nAdditionally, the spleen corpuscles are atrophic, with clear interstitial vessels and fibrous tissue hyperplasia in the splenic sinus (Figure 3) . These results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 causes severe damage in human spleen and LNs.\n\n.

[17] [18] [19] Immunohistochemistry showed that spleen and LN tissues from autopsies and normal healthy controls manifested similar levels of FasL expression (Figure 4C) . On the other hand, the expression of Fas was significantly upregulated in virus infected spleens and LNs, whereas, the expression of Fas is absence in sections from normal healthy controls, as detected by immunofluorescent staining (Figure 4D, E) . These results suggest SARS-CoV-2 promotes lymphocyte apoptosis through enhancing Fas expression.\n\nThe dysregulation of the proinflammatory cytokines like TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 has been described to promote cell necrosis and apoptosis. 20, 21 We also reported that IL-6 might involve in mediating lymphocyte reduction in severe COVID-19 patients. 14 Immunohistochemistry showed that high levels of IL-6 rather TNF-\u03b1 were observed in virus infected spleen and LNs compared with sections from normal healthy controls ( Figure 5A) . Moreover, immunofluorescent double staining showed that IL-6 is primarily produced by infected macrophages (Figure 5B ). Increased transcription of several cytokines in macrophages has been described to be activated by SARS-Spike protein. 22, 23 Since SARS-CoV-2 and SARS share a highly similar Spike protein based on amino acid sequence, we reasoned that a similar phenomenon might occur with SARS-CoV-2 Spike. We thus treated human macrophage line-THP1 cells with Spike protein in vitro, and found that SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein can trigger increased Il6 expression independently of changes in Il1b and Tnfa gene transcription ( Figure 5C) . Collectively, these results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 viruses and the Spike protein, can trigger macrophages to secrete IL-6, which may accelerate lymphocytopenia.\n\nThe COVID-19 is an acute infectious disease that caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. It has been a worldwide epidemic outbreak because SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious and does not respond to . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nis the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint We here showed that the expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 is found in macrophages in human spleen and hilar LNs from autopsy as well as normal healthy (Figure 1) . Similarly, all of the spleens exhibited atrophy of white pulps, with complete loss in some cases. The red pulp is markedly congested and hemorrhagic (Figure 3) . This phenomenon is consistent with older reports of patients infected with SARS-CoV. 27, 28 Taken together, these results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects LNs and spleens to cause severe tissue damage.\n\nWe then sought to investigate the route and identities of the cells that could potentially contribute to SARS-CoV-2 transports into spleens and LNs. From our in situ immunohistochemistry, we showed that viral NP antigen was restricted to the macrophages of the infected tissues, while, human T cells and B cells were negative for viral NP antigen, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 cannot directly infect T and B cells ( Figure 2B ). Most importantly, viral NP + CD68 + macrophages were observed in capillaries of spleens and LNs, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 migrates into spleens and LNs through macrophages. An interesting finding is that overwhelming numbers of NP + cells are observed in red pulp of spleens and within marginal sinus of lymph nodes (Figure 2A) . Previous work have showed that tissue-resident CD169 + macrophages are positioned in the splenic MZ and reside in the subcapsular sinus of LNs. 7, 16 The strategic anatomical positioning of CD169 + macrophages in the spleen and LNs suggest these cells are the first to interact with invading pathogen. Here, we also found that most CD169 + macrophages are positive for viral NP antigens ( Figure 2B) . We therefore reasoned that the CD169 + macrophages play a central role in mediating SARS-CoV-2 translocation in spleens and LNs, and thus contribute to viral growth and spread.\n\n.

In addition to antigen persistence stimulation, some proinflammatory cytokines like IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 can also can mediate cellular apoptosis and necrosis. 20, 21 We focused here on IL-6 because it contributes to host defense against to several kinds of pathogen infections. 21, 29 We also reported that the serum concentration of IL-6 is negative to blood CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in COVID-19 patients. 14 Interestingly, exposure to viral Spike protein can trigger Il6 gene transcription in macrophages in vitro, and SARS-CoV-2 infected macrophage also manifested high levels of IL-6 in vivo ( Figure   5 ). 22, 23 We thereby conjecture that macrophages-derived IL-6 would trigger lymphocyte apoptosis and necrosis, while also enhancing Fas expression. Tocilizumab, a humanized anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, has been developed and approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 30, 31 Tocilizumab has also been shown to be effective against cytokine release syndrome resulting from CAR-T cell infusion against B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. 32 Since Tocilizumab has now been approved for use in clinical therapy for COVID-19 patients, whether tocilizumab can restore spleen and LN functions in COVID-19 patients by suppressing IL-6 signaling is an area requiring further investigation.\n\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can directly infect human LNs and spleens and consequently lead to tissue damage and lymphocyte reduction. We also showed that CD169 + macrophages play a central role in mediating SARS-CoV-2 translocation.\n\nMechanistically, we observed that viral infected macrophages can promote lymphocyte apoptosis though enhancing IL-6 mediated Fas upregulation.\n\nThe authors declare no financial or commercial conflict of interest. .
