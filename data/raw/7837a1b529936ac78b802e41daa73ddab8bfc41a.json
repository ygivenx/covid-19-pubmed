{"title": "Cotranslational Folding Stimulates Programmed Ribosomal Frameshifting in the Alphavirus Structural Polyprotein", "body": "Viruses have evolved numerous mechanisms to exploit the host machinery in order to increase the coding capacity of their highly constrained genomes. There are at least 27 viral genera that utilize programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) in order to produce multiple proteins from a single transcript (https://viralzone.expasy.org/860). PRF is genetically encoded, and minimally requires a portion of the transcript that contains a repetitive \"slippery\" heptanucleotide sequence (slip-site) followed by a region that forms stimulatory RNA secondary structures (an ensemble of stem loops and/ or pseudoknots). 1, 2 A collision between the translating ribosome and the stimulatory secondary structure increases the kinetic barrier to translocation, which causes the ribosome to dwell on the slip-site. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] During this pause, the t-RNA that is annealed within the ribosomal P-site (and most often also the t-RNA in the A-site) 8 begin to sample alternative base pairing interactions that shift the reading frame of the ribosme. 9 Based on these mechanistic considerations, PRF is typically believed to be mediated at the level of RNA structure. Nevertheless, recent reports have also found that the efficiency of -1PRF can be tuned by a variety of regulatory proteins and/ or miRNA. [10] [11] [12] -1PRF is utilized to temporally and stoichiometrically regulate protein production during viral replication and assembly. For instance, the alphavirus structural proteins are most often produced from a single polyprotein that is cleaved into the capsid (CP), E3, E2, 6K, and E1 proteins ( Figure   1A ). 13 The E2 and E1 proteins are membrane glycoproteins that heterodimerize early in the assembly pathway. These dimeric units then form trimeric spike complexes, traffic to the plasma membrane, and initiate viral budding. 14-16 -1PRF during the translation of the 6K protein gives rise to a secondary form of the polyprotein containing the TransFrame (TF) protein, 13 ,17 a known .

Because -1PRF precludes the translation of E1, the efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting (1-48% in alphaviruses) 22 influences the stoichiometric ratio of the E1 and E2 glycoproteins and the net accumulation of spike complexes. Current evidence suggests -1PRF is stimulated by a canonical poly-U slip site and a downstream RNA hairpin. 23 However, an effort to map the stimulatory RNA structures within alphavirus polyproteins revealed that deletions within the predicted hairpin region are capable of reducing the efficiency of -1PRF, but appear to be insufficient to knock out frameshifting completely. 22 This observation suggests there may be multiple regulatory mechanisms that mediate -1PRF within the alphavirus structural polyprotein.\n\n-1PRF occurs during synthesis and processing of the nascent alphavirus structural polyprotein at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Following autoproteolytic cleavage of CP in the cytosol, a signal peptide at the N-terminus of the E3 protein directs the nascent polyprotein to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen where processing of the downstream proteins occurs.\n\nLocalization of these segments within the lumen is essential to ensure that the E3, E2, and E1 ectodomains form their native disulfides and undergo glycosylation. 15, 16, 24 Post-translational modifications are also critical for TF, which must be palmitoylated in order to reach the plasma membrane and incorporate into the viral envelope. 25 The palmitoylated cysteines in TF are positioned near the edge of a putative transmembrane (TM) domain that is found in both TF and 6K. 25, 26 Though these residues are present in both proteins, they are only palmitoylated in the context of the frameshifted polyprotein. 25 Considering palmitoylation only occurs on the cytosolic face of cellular membranes, 27 the distinct modification state of the two forms of the polyprotein is therefore suggestive of an underlying difference in their topologies.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/790444 doi: bioRxiv preprint gain insight into the interplay between -1PRF and the topology of the structural polyprotein. We first mapped the topology of the Sindbis virus (SINV) structural polyprotein. Our results demonstrate that the structural polyprotein forms two topological isomers. The predominant topology features two TM domains upstream of the -1PRF site, and its formation coincides with production of the 6K protein. Alternatively, the minor topology contains an additional TM domain upstream from the -1PRF site that is linked to the production of TF. Using protein engineering in conjunction with coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations, we demonstrate that the efficiency of -1PRF is dependent upon the force generated by the translocon-mediated membrane integration of the extra TM domain within the minor topomer. Together, our observations highlight novel connections between the cotranslational folding, biosynthesis, and processing of the alphavirus structural polyprotein. Moreover, our findings reveal a novel mechanism that regulates the overall efficiency of -1PRF.\n\nThe current model of the alphavirus structural polyprotein suggests the E2 and 6K proteins each contain two TM domains. 13, 28 However, there are two caveats to this model. First, cryo-EM structures reveal that the E2 protein only contains a single TM domain in the context of the viral envelope. 29, 30 Though it has been speculated that a second TM domain within E2 is somehow extruded from the membrane during processing, the marginal hydrophobicity of this segment also raises the possibility that it may fail to undergo translocon-mediated membrane integration in the first place. Second, the hydrophobic portion of the SINV 6K protein is only 35 residues in length, which is quite short for a segment containing two putative TM domains and a loop. These The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/790444 doi: bioRxiv preprint ambiguous topological signals suggest this portion of the polyprotein is frustrated and could potentially form multiple topological isomers, 31 as has been suggested for the coronavirus E protein. 32 To survey the topological preferences of the E2-6K region, we scanned its sequence using a knowledge-based algorithm that predicts the energetics associated with the transfer of polypeptide segments from the translocon to the ER membrane (\u0394G predictor). 33 Energetic predictions suggest only the regions corresponding to the first hydrophobic segments within the E2 (TM1) and 6K (TM3) proteins are sufficiently hydrophobic to undergo robust membrane integration (\u0394G < 0 kcal/ mol, Fig. 1C ). In contrast, the translocon-mediated membrane integration of the second hydrophobic segment within E2 (TM2) is predicted to be inefficient (Fig. 1C) . To test these predictions, we measured the translocon-mediated membrane integration of each putative TM domain using a glycosylation-based translocation assay. 34 Briefly, the sequences of each putative TM domain were cloned into a chimeric leader peptidase (Lep) reporter protein. 34 Membrane integration of the putative TM segment (purple helix, Fig. 1D ) results in the modification of only a single glycosylation site in Lep, whereas the passage of the segment into the lumen results in the modification of two glycosylation sites (Fig. 1D ). Chimeric Lep proteins were produced by in vitro translation in the presence of canine rough microsomes, which contain native ER membranes and translocons. Consistent with predictions, Lep proteins containing TMs 1 & 3 acquire a single glycosyl modification, which suggests these segments undergo robust translocon-mediated membrane integration (Fig. 1E ). In contrast, the translocon-mediated membrane integration of the second putative TM domain of E2 (TM2) is significantly less efficient (Fig. 1E) Fig. 2A ). It should also be noted that -1PRF only modifies the sequence of the loops downstream from these TM domains (Fig. 1C , orange line), and is therefore unlikely to impact their topological preferences.\n\nBased on the computational and biochemical results in Figure 1 , we generated a topological model of the SINV structural polyprotein ( Fig. 2A) . This model correctly places the E2 and E1 ectodomains within the ER lumen, and places the two palmitoylated cysteine residues in E2 (C716 and C718) within the cytosol. 35, 36 To probe the topological preferences of the SINV polyprotein in the cell, we produced and characterized a series of reporter constructs that begin with the E3 protein and end at the C-terminal edge of each of the three putative TM domains within E2 and 6K ( Fig. 2A, Supplemental Fig. 1 ). Each of these fragments was genetically fused to a C-terminal cassette containing a short GS linker and glycosylatable GFP (gGFP) gene, which contains two glycosylation sites within the core of the eGFP protein. 37 Topological signals that direct the gGFP protein into the cytosol will produce a fluorescent gGFP, whereas the glycosylation of gGFP within the ER lumen renders the protein non-fluorescent (Fig. 2B ). Each construct was then expressed in HEK293T cells, and flow cytometry was used to quantify the fluorescence intensity of the gGFP reporter at a consistent expression level as judged by the intensity of a bicistronic reporter protein (Supplemental Fig. 2) . Expression of the reporter constructs containing gGFP downstream from Fig. 2A ) generates fluorescent gGFP (Fig. 2C) , which suggests the C-termini of these TM domains reside within the cytosol. In contrast, the reporter construct with gGFP downstream from TM3 (after R785) exhibits an attenuated GFP signal at an equivalent expression level (Fig. 2C) , which suggests the gGFP fused to the C-terminus of TM3 is projected into the ER lumen. Placement of the gGFP after the full stretch of hydrophobic amino acids in the 6K protein The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/790444 doi: bioRxiv preprint (after Y807, see Fig. 2A ) also results in an attenuated gGFP signal (TM3+ in Fig. 2C ), which confirms the full stretch of hydrophobic residues near TM3 only spans the membrane once. Thus, results from this cellular reporter assay (Fig. 2C ) are consistent with predictions ( Fig. 1C) , in vitro translation data (Fig. 1E) , and the model shown in Figure 2A . These observations together confirm that the E1 and 6K proteins each contain a single TM domain in the most abundant form of the polyprotein.\n\nThe topological properties of the structural polyprotein described above have implications for the manner in which it is processed at the ER membrane. Our model suggests the cluster of unmodified cysteines in the 6K protein (C786, C787, C789, and C790) reside at a C-terminal portion of TM3 that is projected into the ER lumen (Fig. 3A) and is therefore inaccessible to palmitoylating enzymes. However, these same residues are palmitoylated in the TF protein, 25 which suggests the orientation of TM3 must become inverted upon frameshifting in order to expose them to the cytosolic leaflet. Such an inversion could potentially occur as a consequence of the membrane integration of TM2 (Fig. 3B ), which exhibits a weak propensity to undergo translocon-mediated membrane integration (Fig. 1E) . Furthermore, the efficiency associated with the transloconmediated membrane integration of TM2 (~ 20 %, Fig. 1E ) is comparable to the frequency of -1PRF in the SINV polyprotein (~16%). 22 Taken together, these observations potentially suggest a connection between the formation of a secondary topomer and -1PRF.\n\nBased on these observations, we hypothesize that the translocon-mediated membrane integration of TM2 is mechanistically linked to -1PRF and the translation of the TF protein.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/790444 doi: bioRxiv preprint suggests mutations that alter the translocon-mediated membrane integration of TM2 should have a direct impact on -1PRF (Fig. 3) . To test this hypothesis, we assessed whether mutations that alter the hydrophobicity of TM2 also influence -1PRF. Both energetic predictions and in vitro translation measurements suggest the introduction of two non-native leucine residues into TM2 (T738L & S739L, LL mutant) enhances the translocon-mediated membrane integration of TM2 (predicted \u0394\u0394G = -1.7 kcal/ mol, Supplemental Fig. 3 ). In contrast, the introduction of two glutamate residues into TM2 (V735E & I736E, EE mutant) is predicted to increase its transfer free energy by 3.3 kcal/ mol, which should significantly reduce its membrane integration efficiency (Supplemental Fig. 3A ). The effects of the EE substitutions appear to be subtle in the context of the Lep protein (Supplemental Fig. 3B ), though this likely reflects the limited dynamic range of this translocation assay. 34, 38 Nevertheless, these results clearly show that the LL and EE mutations alter the translocon-mediated membrane integration of TM2.\n\nTo determine whether the cotranslational membrane integration of TM2 impacts translational recoding, we measured the effects of these substitutions on ribosomal frameshifting. PRF is most commonly measured using dual-luciferase reporters, which fuse luciferase domains to the 5' (renilla luciferase, 0-frame) and 3' (firefly luciferase, -1 frame) of the gene of interest. The activity of firefly luciferase serves as a reporter for -1PRF and is normalized relative to translational efficiency based on the activity of renilla luciferase. Current versions of these reporter constructs contain self-cleaving 2A segments that release these luciferase domains from the polypeptide of interest. 39 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/790444 doi: bioRxiv preprint preserve the integrity of the signal peptide, we generated a series of reporter constructs in which translation begins at the native E3 signal peptide and continues until the ribosome reaches a fluorescent mKate fusion domain that is encoded in the -1 reading frame downstream from the PRF site (Supplemental Fig. 4 ). To control for variations in transfection efficiency at the singlecell level, we included a downstream IRES cassette that drives the bicistronic expression of GFP from the reporter transcript. Reporter constructs encoding TM2 variants of the polyprotein were expressed in HEK293T cells, and cellular mKate intensities were quantitatively compared across cells within a discrete range of IRES-GFP intensities by flow cytometry (Supplemental Fig. 5 ).\n\nThe average mKate intensity among cells expressing a reporter construct bearing mutations that knock out the native ribosomal slip-site (UUUUUUA\u2192 GUUCCUA, SSKO) is 79 \u00b1 5% lower than that that among cells expressing the WT form of the reporter (n = 3, Fig. 4A ), which confirms that mKate intensities reflect the efficiency of -1PRF. The EE substitutions in TM2 decrease mKate intensity by 61 \u00b1 16% relative to WT (n = 3, Fig. 4A ). In contrast, the LL substitutions increase the mKate intensity by 30 \u00b1 11% (n = 3, Fig. 4A ). It should be emphasized that each of these reporters contain both the native slip-site and stem loop regions, and that these mutations do not alter their sequences. Thus, these findings demonstrate that -1PRF is sensitive to mutations that impact the membrane integration efficiency of TM2. Together, biochemical evidence suggests that TM2 is inefficiently recognized by the translocon (Fig. 1E) , and cellular topology reporters suggest that this segment is most often localized within the cytosol (Fig. 2) . Nevertheless, mutagenesis reveals that the propensity of the nascent chain to form a secondary topomer is positively correlated with -1PRF. These results are therefore suggestive of a mechanistic link between topogenesis and -1PRF.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/790444 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nThe apparent link between cotranslational folding and ribosomal frameshifting has implications for the mechanism of -1PRF in the SINV structural polyprotein. The portion of the transcript containing the EE and LL mutations is over 100 nucleotides upstream from the ribosomal slip site, and should therefore not perturb the stimulatory RNA structures that are currently believed to modulate -1PRF. 2, 22, 23 These mutations instead alter the portion of the nascent chain that falls just outside of the ribosomal exit tunnel during -1PRF, which suggests the nascent chain itself may stimulate frameshifting. Though it has yet to be implicated in ribosomal frameshifting, the cotranslational membrane integration and/ or folding of the nascent chain is known to generate tension on the ribosome. [41] [42] [43] [44] Furthermore, the C-terminal residue of TM2 is positioned 45 residues upstream of the slip site, which corresponds to a distance that should maximize the tension on the nascent chain at the moment the slip site occupies the ribosomal active site. 41, 42 Previous investigations have demonstrated that the force generated by the membrane integration of the nascent chain is sharply dependent upon this spacing. 41, 42 Therefore, to assess the potential role of this force in ribosomal frameshifting, we generated a set of SINV -1PRF reporter constructs (used in Fig. 4A ) containing a series of insertions and deletions that alter the distance between TM2 and the ribosomal slip site (see Supplemental Table 1 ). Reporter constructs were then expressed in HEK293T cells, and -1PRF reporter intensities were quantitatively compared at a uniform expression level by flow cytometry (Supplemental Fig. 5) . A comparison of reporter intensities reveals that -1PRF is maximized at the WT distance of 45 residues (Fig. 4B) . In all cases, deletions and insertions that change the distance between TM2 and the slip site significantly reduce the efficiency of -1PRF (Fig. 4B) . Moreover, the insertion of a 10-residue G/S linker decreases the intensity of the frameshift reporter by 76 \u00b1 8% (n = 3), which suggests the membrane integration .

Together these findings suggest topological signals within the SINV structural polyprotein generate a mechanical force that stimulates -1PRF.\n\nTo further explore the interplay between sequence, topology, and force, we carried out coarsegrained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations of the translation and translocon-mediated membrane integration of the nascent structural polyprotein. 44, 45 In these simulations, three-residue segments of the nascent chain are modeled as individual beads with physicochemical properties based on their constituent amino acids. New beads are translated at a rate of 5 amino acids per second, and emerge from the ribosome-translocon complex into an environment with an implicit representation of the bilayer and cytosol (Supplemental Movie 1). 45 These simulations were previously found to sufficiently recapitulate several aspects of cotranslational membrane protein folding including the formation of topological isomers and the generation of tension on the nascent chain. 44, 46, 47 CGMD simulations of SINV polyprotein biosynthesis suggest the nascent chain samples several different topological isomers (Fig. 5A) , and that its topological heterogeneity persists after the polyprotein has cleared the translocon. TM2 undergoes translocon-mediated membrane integration (Fig. 5A, right) in only 44 \u00b1 4% of the CGMD trajectories in which TM1 is correctly integrated into the membrane. Consistent with expectations, CGMD simulations suggest that the membrane integration efficiency of TM2 is enhanced by the LL mutations (51 \u00b1 4%) and reduced by the EE mutations (11 \u00b1 3%).

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/790444 doi: bioRxiv preprint topological frustration within this domain (see Fig. 3 ) arises primarily from its marginal hydrophobicity.\n\nTo evaluate the connection between pulling forces on the nascent chain and frameshifting, we measured the tension on the nascent chain at the point of elongation when the slip site occupies the ribosomal active site (Supplemental Movie 1). 47 Pulling forces were highest for the LL variant, which averaged 4.2 pN higher than the WT. In contrast, the EE mutations reduce the pulling force on the nascent chain by an average 2.3 pN relative to WT. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that differences in frameshifting arise from the effects of these mutations on the pulling force on the nascent chain. Simulations of polyprotein variants bearing insertions or deletions that alter the distance between TM2 and the ribosomal slip-site indicate that the native distance (45 residues) is nearly optimal for the transmission of pulling force through the nascent chain (Supplemental Table 1 ), which is consistent with the observed patterns in frameshifting (Fig. 4B) .\n\nOverall, we find the -1PRF efficiency associated with each polyprotein variant roughly scales with corresponding mean pulling force measurements from CGMD simulations (Pearson's R = 0.75, Fig. 5B ), which strongly suggests that the pulling forces generated by the translocon-mediated membrane integration of the nascent chain stimulate -1PRF.\n\nAn analysis of the spectrum of topological states sampled during translation reveals that the magnitude of the pulling force transmitted to the ribosome scales with the number of beads that occupy the translocon (Fig. 5C ). This finding suggests pulling forces are generated by the movement of hydrophobic transmembrane segments from the protein-conducting channel of the translocon to the hydrophobic membrane core, as has been established previously. 40, 41, 47 This .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/790444 doi: bioRxiv preprint interpretation suggests differences in pulling forces arise from variations in the distribution of topological isomers that form during translation of these variants (Fig. 5D) . The LL mutant predominately samples conformations where the majority of TM2 beads are in the translocon (Fig.   5A, right) , whereas the EE mutant almost exclusively adopts conformations in which the majority of TM2 beads fall outside of the translocon and within the cytosol (Fig. 5A, left) . As passage through the translocon is a prerequisite for membrane integration, the relationship between pulling forces and residence of the nascent chain within the translocon is consistent with our model for structural polyprotein biogenesis (Fig. 3) and confirms that the translocon-mediated membrane integration of TM2 stimulates -1PRF.\n\nOur model suggests that the hydrophobicity of TM2 and its distance from the slip site are the key determinants of the -1PRF efficiency within the SINV structural polyprotein. To assess whether this mechanism is likely to be operative within other alphaviruses, we surveyed six related structural polyproteins for similar sequence elements. Sequence scans carried out with the \u0394G predictor reveal that each form of the alphavirus structural polyprotein contains a marginally hydrophobic TM domain upstream from the ribosomal slip site. Predicted transfer free energies associated with the translocon-mediated membrane integration of these putative TM domains range from +1.4 to +2.7 kcal/ mol (Table 1) , which suggests the translocon-mediated membrane integration of these segments is likely to be inefficient. Consistent with this notion, CGMD simulations of the translation of these polyproteins indicate that the membrane integration efficiency of these segments ranges from 33-64% (Table 1) . Furthermore, these marginally hydrophobic TM domains reside 44-52 residues upstream of their corresponding -1PRF sites .

Taken together, these findings suggest that this -1PRF mechanism is likely to be conserved across the alphavirus genus.\n\nAdditional investigations are needed to determine how nascent chain-and RNA-mediated -1PRF mechanisms are balanced against one another, and how this mechanistic diversity ultimately influences viral evolution.\n\nUsing an array of biochemical, cellular, and computational methods we show that the nascent SINV structural polyprotein forms a spectrum of topological intermediates during biosynthesis, and that -1PRF is primarily driven by the translocon-mediated membrane integration of a marginally hydrophobic TM domain within the E2 protein. We also provide evidence to suggest this mechanism is likely to be conserved across the alphavirus genus. To date, the mechanistic basis of -1PRF has been generally attributed to the kinetic effects of mechanochemical forces that are generated by structural elements within the mRNA. Indeed, we do find that PRF in the SINV structural polyprotein is dependent upon the RNA stem loop downstream of the slip-site (Supplemental Fig. 6 ). Nevertheless, it is clear that the forces generated by the translocon-mediated membrane integration of TM2 dramatically enhance the frameshifting efficiency. To our knowledge, the findings reported herein constitute the first instance in which forces generated by conformational transitions in the nascent polypeptide chain have been implicated in the efficiency .

Though additional investigations are needed to elucidate how pulling forces in the nascent chain physically stimulate -1PRF, a causative role for tension in both the transcript and nascent chain seems plausible given that ribosomal frameshifting fundamentally arises from the movement of the tRNA with respect to the mRNA. It seems likely that cotranslational folding is one of many regulators, which include both host and viral effectors, that tune the net efficiency of PRF. This creates the potential for mechanistic diversity that could provide an evolutionary benefit for alphaviruses, as -1PRF is rendered tunable by either downstream or upstream mutations that impact the stability of the mRNA hairpin or the conformational ensemble of the nascent chain, respectively. This flexibility could also potentially provide the virus with a means of maintaining desired -1PRF levels in the presence host factors that globally regulate -1PRF through mRNA interactions. 12 It should be noted that the implications of these findings potentially extend beyond the realm of viral proteins. A wide variety of molecular transitions have been found to generate tension within the nascent chain including the folding of soluble domains near the ribosomal exit tunnel 43 and the translocon-mediated membrane integration of nascent TM domains. 40, 41 These observations suggest the tension in the nascent chain should fluctuate as the structural features emerge from the ribosome (Fig. 6A) , which may therefore provide the ribosome with a readout for the progress of cotranslational folding. In the case of the SINV structural polyprotein, the topological frustration within the nascent chain leads to the production of two competing topomers that generate distinct pulling forces on the ribosome in a manner that ultimately impacts the fidelity and processivity of translation ( Fig. 6 B & C) . Additional investigations are needed to explore the potential relevance of this type of cotranslational feedback to protein homeostasis. Indeed, interactions between the .

This could potentially account for the fact that the deletion of components of the ribosome-associated chaperone complex has been found to attenuate -1PRF in yeast. 50 Future investigations are needed to evaluate the full range of -1PRF effectors and how these are potentially exploited for regulatory purposes.\n\nThe energetics associated with the translocon-mediated membrane integration of the nascent structural polyprotein were carried out using the \u0394G predictor (http://dgpred.cbr.su.se/). 34 These predictions are generated using a window scan function that sums depth-dependent free energies associated with the transfer of amino acids from the translocon to the ER membrane. 33 Full sequence scans of varying window size were used to compare the predicted transfer free energies associated with each segment within the polyprotein in order to identify the segments that are most likely to undergo translocon-mediated membrane integration.\n\nChimeric Lep genes were generated in the context of a pGEM-based Lep expression vector 34 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

To produce a series of reporter constructs for polyprotein topology, Gibson assembly was then used to replace the portion of the polyprotein gene downstream from each putative TM domain with a genetic cassette containing a 10-residue G/S linker, a glycosylatable eGFP gene, 37 an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES), and an mKate gene, respectively (Supplemental Fig. 1 ).\n\nTo produce a series of reporter constructs for ribosomal frameshifting, Gibson assembly was used to replace the portion of the polyprotein gene that falls 100 basepairs downstream from the ribosomal slips site in the 6K gene with a cassette containing an mKate gene in the -1 reading frame followed by an IRES and a GFP gene (Supplemental Fig. 4 ). The frameshift reporter (mKate) was fused 100 nucleotides downstream from the slip site in order to avoid disrupting the stimulatory RNA hairpin downstream from the slip sites. 22, 23 In addition to avoiding potential issues related to the impact of fusion domains on SRP-targeting of the nascent chain, this design also avoids recently described artefacts associated with previous generations of the dual-luciferase reporter system in two ways. 39 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Lep proteins were then produced from mRNA by in vitro translation using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI) supplemented with canine pancreatic rough microsomes (tRNA probes, College Station, TX) and EasyTag 35 S methionine (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). In vitro translation reactions were then diluted 1:4 into 1X SDS PAGE sample buffer and separated using a 12% SDS PAGE gel. To image radioactive translation products, PAGE gels were then dried, exposed to a phosphorimaging screen, and imaged using a Typhoon Imager (GE Healthcare, New York, NY). Image J software was then employed to process the data quantify the glycosylation state of each construct by densitometry. \n\nCoarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations are based on a previously developed and tested approach. 44 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Despite the significant simplifications involved in this model, the CGMD model has proven accurate in capturing the integration probabilities, topology distributions, and forces experienced in previous studies. 44, 45, 47 In order to obtain the distribution of topologies for various polyprotein mutants, the translation and integration of each sequence was simulated 560 times. In order to reduce computational cost, simulations only included the first three TMDs of the alphavirus polyprotein. In order to focus on the topological preferences of TM2, restraints were applied to enforce that TM1 adopts its native topological orientation. Pulling force measurements were performed by pausing translation when the -1PRF site resides within the ribosomal peptidyl transfer center. During this pause, the final bead was fixed in place and the force on the bead exerted by the nascent chain was measured along the translocon channel axis. Due to the truncation of the exit tunnel in our model, the final bead corresponds to the amino acids 27 residues N-terminal of the -1PRF site. Translation is paused for 3 seconds, which is equivalent to the time it would take to translate 5 beads. This relatively short time window ensures that the distribution of polyprotein topologies is not affected by the pause.\n\nDuring this window, pulling forces were measured at a rate of 333 frames per second. In order to sample a wide range of topologies and conformations, each mutant was independently simulated 560 times. This protocol is analogous to force measurements performed in previous work, with exception of a shortened pausing duration. 47\n\n.
