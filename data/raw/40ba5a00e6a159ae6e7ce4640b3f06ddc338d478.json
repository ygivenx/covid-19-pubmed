{"title": "Neutrophil activation and arteritis induced by C. albicans water-soluble mannoprotein-\u03b2-glucan complex (CAWS)", "body": "Recently, clinical relevance of fungal diseases has increased, mainly because of an increasing population of immunocompromised individuals including those infected with HIV, transplant recipients and patients with cancer (Zupanic-Krmek and Nemet, 2004) . Neutrophils play a key role during Candida albicans (C. albicans) infection (Urban et al., 2006; Fradin et al., 2005) . C. albicans organisms exposed to erythrocytes, mononuclear cells, plasma or blood lacking neutrophils become physiologically active and rapidly switch to filamentous growth. In contrast, the presence of neutrophils arrested C. albicans growth (Urban et al., 2006; Fradin et al., 2005) .\n\nAnimal model is useful to clarify mechanism of infection process, genetic background differences and for development of a strategy for therapy (Nagi-Miura et al., 2004; Aratani et al., 2002; Spellberg et al., 2005) .\n\nSome microorganisms or microorganism-derived products are associated with specific diseases. For example, certain Campylobacter jejuni strains trigger Guillain-Barre syndrome while other strains trigger the Fisher syndrome in the Japanese population (Takahashi et al., 2005) . Esper et al. have reported that New Haven coronavirus (HCoV-NH) infection is associated with Kawasaki disease (Esper et al., 2005) . Recently, Iwai et al. have identified oral microorganisms in the lesions of Buerger disease, suggesting a possible etiologic link between Buerger disease and chronic infections such as oral bacterial infections (Iwai et al., 2005) . We have established a mouse model which shows the symptoms of coronary arteritis following consecutive injections into mice of a water-soluble polysaccharide from Candida sp. (CAWS) (Nagi-Miura et al., 2004; Ohno, 2003) . In this study, we examined neutrophil activation and subsequent events after a single injection of CAWS (Fig. 1 ).\n\nELISA kits for mouse IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 p70, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 were purchased from BD Biosciences (CA, USA), IL-18 was from Medical and Biological Laboratories (Nagoya, Japan), soluble ICAM-1 and MIP-2 were from R&D Systems (MN, USA), G-CSF and GM-CSF were from AN'ALYZA (MN, US). fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLP) was purchased from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan), 3,3\u2032, 5,5\u2032-tetrametylbendizine (TMB), cytochalasin B (CB), cytochrome c, RPMI 1640 medium, aprotinin and PMSF were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (MO, USA). Casein was purchased from Calbiochem. Co. (Darmstadt, Germany) . TaqMan Universal PCR master mix was purchased from PE Biosystems (NJ, USA). Monoclonal antibody and peroxidase-conjugated IgG fraction to mouse C3 were purchased from HyCult biotechnology (Uden, The Netherlands) and MP Biochemicals, Inc. (CA, USA), respectively.\n\nC57BL/6N male mice were purchased from Charles River Japan, kept under SPF conditions, and used according to a guideline for animal care of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases. The mice were used in the experiment at 6 weeks of age.\n\nPreparation and administration of CAWS CAWS was prepared from C. albicans strain IFO1385 in accordance with conventional methods (Nagi-Miura et al., 2004) . CAWS was dissolved in PBS. After autoclaving, 0.2 ml of the material (20 mg/ml) was intraperitoneally injected into a mouse. For vitro assay, neutrophils isolated from 8% caseininduced peritoneal exudated cells were co-cultured with CAWS in RPMI medium containing 0.3 mM PMSF and 0.4 \u03bcg/ml aprotinin.\n\nCoronary artery segments were fixed in 10% buffered (pH7.2) formaldehyde, paraffin-embedded, and sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. \n\nPeripheral blood was collected from heart and EDTA-2K was added. Leukocyte profiles were analyzed by use of automation instruments (Mitsubishi BCL Corp., Tokyo, Japan).\n\nPeripheral blood was collected from heart and EDTA-2K was added. After lysis for 5 min at 4\u00b0C, subsequent centrifugation (1000\u00d7g at 4\u00b0C, cells) was suspended in HBSS. Bone marrow cells were prepared from a shinbone. The cells were incubated with mAb against surface markers (BD Pharmingen, CA, USA). Gr-1 (RB6-8C5), Mac-1 (M1/70) were used for flow cytometric analysis, and then analyzed with FACSCalibur using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences, CA, USA).\n\nHeparinized blood was collected from heart, and neutrophil was prepared. MPO release and superoxide generation were measured as described previously (Ishida-Okawara et al., 1991) .\n\nLevels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, TNF-\u03b1, INF-\u03b3, MIP-2, soluble ICAM-1, G-CSF, GM-CSF in plasma using individual ELISA.\n\nPreparation of peritoneal exudate neutrophils and measurement of cytokine production level by co-cultured neutrophil with CAWS Normal C57BL/6N mice were intraperitoneally injected with 4 ml of 8% casein in PBS and exudate cells containing resident macrophage or caseininduced neutrophils were recovered 8 h lavage with 5 ml of PBS. The exudate cells were put onto M-SMF (Japan Immunoresearch Laboratories Co., Ltd., Takasaki, Japan), centrifuged 1200\u00d7g for 20 min at room temperature. Neutrophils were suspended (5 \u00d7 10 6 cells/ml) in RPMI-1640 medium containing 0.3 mM PMSF and 0.4 \u03bcg/ml aprotinin and co-cultured with 1 mg/ml CAWS for 0.5 to 4 h. At the end of culture, culture supernatant was prepared by centrifugation and levels of cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10 were determined using by ELISA kits.\n\nThe thoracic aortas of mice were isolated and frozen immediately for detection of ICAM-1 mRNA. The total aortic RNA for each mouse was isolated using ISOGEN (Nippon ene, Tokyo Japan). One microgram of RNA was reverse transcribed with ReverTra Ace (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) to obtain cDNA. Real-time PCR was performed using ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, CA, US) according to the manufacture's protocol. Primers and TaqMan probes specific for ICAM-1 was obtained from Assay-on-Demand Gene Expression Products (Applied Biosystems). For endogenous control, the level of GAPDH in each sample was measured using TaqMan Rodent GAPDH Control Reagents VIC (Applied Biosystems). Data analyses were performed on ABI PRISM 7000 SDS software version 1.0 (Applied Biosystems).\n\nPeripheral blood was collected from heart and EDTA-2K was added. One \u03bcg/ml of C3 monoclonal antibody was coated to ELISA plate for overnight. After washing, blocking was done by 50% FCS for 1 h. Sample plasma (\u00d7 100) was added to the plate for 1 h, after washing peroxidase labeled-2nd antibody (\u00d71000) was added to the plate. After washing, o-phenylenediamine chloride was added to the plate for 3 min. Finally, reaction was stopped 2 N hydrogen sulphate and measured at 490 nm by auto reader (Nippon Bunko, Tokyo, Japan). Western blotting was performed by using mouse C3 monoclonal antibody and peroxidase-labeled anti-Rat IgG as 2nd antibody. Fig. 2 . Change of blood profile after CAWS injection. Peripheral blood was collected from heart in EDTA-2K. Blood profile was analyzed by Mitsubishi Kagaku BCL Inc. (a) total leukocyte number, ratio of (b) neutrophil, (c) lymphocyte and (d) monocyte, respectively. N = 6 in each group.\n\nResults expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD. Statistical analysis was using Mann-Whitney U-test. The probability value of <0.05 was considered significant.\n\nWe have severe coronary arteritis by daily injection of CAWS (4 mg/mouse/day) for 5 days. In order to compare initial events and development of coronary arteritis, the current studies employed a one shot injection of CAWS at a dose of 4 mg/mouse. Four weeks after CAWS injection with this protocol, arteritis was evident in both coronary and aorta (Fig. 1) .\n\nAfter CAWS injection, total leukocyte counts were increased and later returned to baseline levels 4 h (Fig. 2a) . The ratio of lymphocytes decreased after CAWS injection, while ratio of neutrophils promptly increased (Figs. 2b, c) , the ratio of monocyte increased (Fig. 2d) .\n\nTo confirm the leukocyte counts, flow cytometric analysis of peripheral and bone marrow cells after CAWS injection was done (Table 1 ). Bone marrow cell numbers the tibia were significantly increased 4 h after CAWS injection (data not shown). The ratio of Gr-1 cells in bone marrow significantly decreased at 0.5, 1, 4 h after CAWS injection, while the ratio of the cells in peripheral blood increased suggesting that neutrophils in bone marrow promptly migrate to peripheral blood after CAWS injection.\n\nTo assess the functional response of neutrophils after CAWS injection, MPO release and superoxide generation were (Fig. 3) . fMLP-induced MPO release from neutrophils was enhanced after CAWS injection (Fig. 3b) , while spontaneous MPO release was not changed (Fig. 3a) . In addition, both fMLP and PMA-induced superoxide generation was enhanced following in vivo CAWS injection (Figs. 3c, d) .\n\nSince activation of neutrophils was observed, after in vivo injection of CAWS, proinflammatory cytokines levels in plasma were measured (Fig. 4) . IL-12 p70 production was increased (Fig. 4d) , while levels of IL-1\u03b2 (b), IL-10 (c), 1L-6 (d) were significantly increased transiently in the first 1-2 h after CAWS injection. Levels of MIP-2 and G-CSF in plasma increased several hours after CAWS injection and were maintained 16 h after CAWS injection (Figs. 4e, f). On the other hand, IL-18, TNF-\u03b1, INF-\u03b3, GM-CSF were not detected up to 16 h after CAWS injection (data not shown). Since IL-1\u03b2, IL-10, IL-6 was significantly increased, production of these cytokines by casein-induced neutrophils was also measured (Fig. 5) . IL-6 production was enhanced by exposure of neutrophils to CAWS (Fig. 5c) , while those of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-10 were nearly the same in presence or absence of CAWS (Figs. 5a, b) .\n\nSince ICAM-1 is a marker of activation of endothelial cells, we assayed plasma for soluble ICAM-1 (sICAM-1) after in vivo infusion of CAWS. sICAM-1 gradually increased in plasma after CAWS injection (Fig. 6a ). In addition, ICAM-1 mRNA in extracts from the thoracic aortic wall was also significantly increased 16 h after CAWS injection (Fig. 6b) .\n\nActivation of complement was examined (Fig. 7) . C3 in plasma decreased time dependently after CAWS injection and gradually returned to normality thereafter (Fig. 7a) . This was confirmed by Western blotting analysis (Fig. 7b) . These results suggest that neutrophil activation triggered through complement activation by a single injection.\n\nIn study, we focused on neutrophil activation related to development of coronary arteritis. Single injection of CAWS at a dose of 4 mg/mouse induced coronary arteritis 4 weeks, featuring intense neutrophil accumulation in the coronary arterial wall. This observation was similar Fig. 4 . Cytokine release into plasma after CAWS injection. Heparinized blood was obtained from heart after CAWS injection. Plasma was separated and proinflammatory cytokines level was measured by ELISA kit. (a) IL-12 p70, (b) IL-1\u03b2, (c) IL-10, (d) IL-6, (e) MIP-2, (f) G-CSF, respectively. N = 6 in each group.\n\nto the development of coronary arteritis daily injection of CAWS (4 mg/mouse/day) 5 days (Nagi-Miura et al., 2004; Ohno, 2003) .\n\nBlood neutrophils and subsequently monocyte increased, while lymphocyte counts decreased. In addition, the ratio of Gr-1 cells in bone marrow decreased, suggesting migration of neutrophils from bone marrow into peripheral blood after CAWS injection. G-CSF after CAWS injection, fMLP-induced MPO release from neutrophils was enhanced as was PMA and fMLP-induced superoxide generation in vivo injection. These results suggest that CAWS increases the number of blood neutrophils and induces their activation early after CAWS injection.\n\nLevels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and 1L-10 significantly increased in plasma after CAWS injection. These cytokines are also released from blood leukocytes live C. albicans (Netea et al., 2002; Gasparoto et al., 2004) . The type of cytokines appearing seems to be different depend on Candida strain, component and virulence (Villar et al., 2005) . With regard to casein-induced neutrophils, IL-6 was significantly enhanced by co-culture with CAWS, but IL-1\u03b2 and 1L-10 production virtually unchanged in presence of CAWS. These results suggest IL-6 production was especially enhanced by CAWS. The levels of MIP-2 and G-CSF in plasma were maintained for 16 h, neutrophil levels in blood, MIP-2 and G-CSF in blood.\n\nThe cause of increases and activation of peripheral neutrophils after CAWS injection is not known. Complement activation products may well be candidates because C5a is a chemoattractant for and activator of neutrophils (Guo and Ward, 2005 (Mullick et al., 2004) .\n\nSoluble ICAM-1, which is a marker of activated endothelial cells (Collins et al., 2000; Iiyama et al., 1999) , in blood increased after CAWS injection. In addition, ICAM-1 message was significantly increased in the thoracic aortic wall 16 h after CAWS injection. Both systemic and local increases in ICAM-1 could be involved to subsequent endothelial cell lesion development (Di Lorenzo et al., 2004) .\n\nIn summary, increased numbers and activation of peripheral blood neutrophils are the initial events after CAWS injection, Fig. 5 . Cytokine production by neutrophil. Casein-induced neutrophil (5 \u00d7 10 6 cells/ml) was suspended in RPMI-1640 containing 0.3 mM PMSF and 1.4 \u03bcg/ml aprotinin and co-cultured with 1 mg/ml CAWS for 0.5 to 4 h. The culture supernatant was prepared by centrifugation and level of cytokine. (a) IL-1\u03b2, (b) IL-10 and (c) IL-6, was measured respectively. \u25cb not treated by CAWS \u2022 1 mg/ml of CAWS.

Plasma was separated and ICAM-1level was measured by ELISA kit. (b) Total RNA was extracted and mRNA was isolated. cDNA was prepared from 1 \u03bcg of mRNA. Realtime PCR was performed and analyzed. GAPDH was used as an internal control. White bar shows not treated by CAWS, black bar shows treated by 4 mg/mouse of CAWS, respectively. N = 6 in each group. perhaps followed by macrophage activation and adaptive immune responses. It is believed that neutrophils have a primary role in host defense against C. albicans or its products. Arteritis induced by CAWS might be related to activation of neutrophils in circulated blood and their accumulation in arterial and aortic walls where ICAM-1 has been expressed. Fig. 7 . Mouse complement 3 (C3) was assessed in plasma by sandwich ELISA and Western blotting. 10 mM EDTA-2K treated blood was prepared from heart after CAWS injection.
