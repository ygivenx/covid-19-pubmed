{"title": "Demonstration of four entities of appendicitis in China through studying cluster/outbreak", "body": "In more than 100 years, there has been no breakthrough in the etiology of appendicitis, and it is still unsure how many different entities of appendicitis exist.\n\nNatural history of acute appendicitis has classically been described to often progress from an non-perforated appendicitis to perforated appendicitis. [1] [2] Majority of the patients have elevated body temperature, total white blood cells counts and neutrophils in differential. 3 A new hypothesis has been proposed that perforated appendicitis and nonperforated appendicitis may be different entities with different natural history. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] This has become modern classification. 9 The infectious etiology, differential diagnosis and management for perforated appendicitis and non-perforated appendicitis are current hot topics. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] Since the appendix is connected to cecum which is exposed to the environment outside of human body, appendicitis can be caused by different etiologies. Therefore, appendicitis should not be only one entity, but a group of different entities. The histological examination of sporadic patients is targeted at a certain stage of different entities of appendicitis and the histological changes of appendicitis can not be seen continuously for same entity of appendicitis. It is therefore the classic description of natural history of appendicitis and the modern classification are deduced, not evidenced.\n\nIn 1984, a cluster of true appendicitis occurred in a town of 8,000 people in the United States. 31 Thirteen patients of appendicitis occurred during a 3-month period.\n\nRegarding this clustering of appendicitis\uff0cthe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) stated that the cluster offered a unique opportunity to identify possible risk factors and to search for precipitating infectious agents, and encouraged reporting such cluster to CDC. 32 Since then, no typical cluster of true appendicitis has occurred until 1997. In 1997, we found a more severe cluster of appendicitis among students at a high school in China. 33 As this type of appendicitis had unique pathologic findings, namely, hemorrhage in the lamina propria and hyperplastic lymphoid follicles, We tentatively named this condition \"acute hemorrhagic appendicitis.\" In 2012, Fusobacteria were also found in appendices of our clustering patients. 34 Since beginning of 2005, we have been looking for new cluster/outbreak of appendicitis. We found that clusters/outbreaks occurred in many provinces of China and some of them were reported in English and some in Chinese medical journals. The aim of this study was to provide a new method to demonstrate different entities of appendicitis, causal association between microbiota and different entities of appendicitis and to improve modern understanding of sporadic patients. A second aim was to confirm common settings of outbreak/cluster of appendicitis and to provide guidance to find new clusters/outbreaks of appendicitis worldwide. A third aim is to provide the epidemiological evidences of infectious etiology of appendicitis.\n\nSince 1985, Tibetan students were enrolled in the schools of 20 provinces and municipalities of China. We learned that incidence rates of appendicitis increased in many of these schools. From beginning of 2005, we contacted four schools in four provinces where Tibetan students were enrolled and cluster/outbreak of acute appendicitis occurred there for years. Finally we selected Tibetan students as study population at a high school in Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, China, because this high school and the hospital that treated student with appendicitis were willing to collaborate with this investigation.\n\nWe performed retrospective study of prevalence of acute appendicitis among Tibetan students from 2005, and since then carried out surveillance to July 2018. Since 2010, cluster/outbreak has not occurred because the school enrolled children of Han government officials sent to support Tibetan. These children did not live in countryside of Tibet and were not susceptible population, therefore we stop collecting data after 2010.\n\nThe patients' clinical, laboratory and histological examination information were collected on a standardized data collection form.\n\nThe study was approved by ethic board at participating hospital and Wuhan University School of Medicine, written informed consent was obtained from each patients and the subjects were interviewed since 2005.\n\nTo be included in this study, the following inclusion criteria have to be met: typical clinical manifestations of acute appendicitis and histologic features of acute appendicitis.\n\nAll histologic slides from appendectomy were re-examined in Department of Pathology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University.\n\nAll rights reserved.

[37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] Among them, 7 clusters/outbreaks presented histological diagnosis or data of body temperature, white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil percentage (NP, Considering that the change of neutrophils was indicated as a percentage of neutrophils in literature of cluster/outbreak, the change of neutophils in the patients of Tibetan students was also indicated as NP) \uff0c which included 473 patients total.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Many patients were classmates and/or roommates (data not shown). They had a contact history and suffered from acute appendicitis sequentially.\n\nThere were no obvious seasonal variations of patient occurrence among the Tibetan students. Cluster/outbreak of patients with acute appendicitis never occurred among more than 7000 native students at this school.\n\n117 of the 120 patients operated on were from the collaborating hospital, from which clinical and laboratory data were obtained for the study; the other 3 patients, who were operated on but whose clinical and laboratory data were not obtained, were not hospitalized at the collaborating hospital.\n\nThe Clinical Features were presented in table 2. The patients' clinical symptoms are similar to classic appendicitis, but patients' results of body temperature and routine blood tests exhibited an obvious different pattern, namely, only a minority of the patients had mildly elevated body temperature and WBC (10.5 \u00d710 9 /L to 15 \u00d710 9 /L) or elevated neutrophil percentage (range 84% to 85%) on differential.\n\nThe mean length of time between onset of symptoms and operation (patients' time) was about 4.7 days and the longest length of time between onset of symptoms and operation was 31days.

The epidemiological features of infectious diseases will be summarized in discussion. According to table 3, there are two entities of classic appendicitis (cluster/outbreak 1-2, 37 51 patients ; cluster/outbreak 3 38 and cluster/outbreak 6-7, [40] [41] [42] [43] Total 283 patients ) and two entities of non-perforated appendicitis (cluster/outbreak 4, 31 31patients and cluster/outbreak 5, 39 108 patients). We did not find cluster/outbreak where most patients had gangrenous appendicitis or perforated appendicitis. In other words, we did not demonstrate perforated appendicitis as an independent entity. Natural history and features of Clusters/outbreaks 3 and cluster/outbreak 6-7 were identical to classic description of natural history from non-perforated appendicitis to perforated appendicitis. The different forms of inflammation in appendices for classic appendicitis were histological features of different stage of same entity, not different All rights reserved.

The clinical features showed elevated body temperature, WBC and NC in majority of patients, which is similar to most sporadic appendicitis and suggest that the patients in clusters/outbreaks 3 and cluster/outbreak 6-7 were likely the same type of appendicitis as majority of sporadic patients.\n\nIn cluster/outbreak 1-2, the onset of patients occurred between 3 and 12 hours after eating overnight food. 90.2% (46/51) of patients had phlegmonous appendicitis and 76.5 % (39/51) had elevated body temperature. 51% (26 of 51) of patients had more stink pus around appendix which may develop to gangrenous appendicitis and perforation if surgery was not carried out. We classify outbreak 1-2 into classic appendicitis. Each patient had obvious digestive manifestation and occasional diarrhea 5, 23 . The patients had no bloody purulent stool and no tenesmus, therefore dysentery can be excluded.\n\nCluster/outbreak 1-2 is different entities from clusters/outbreaks 3 and cluster/outbreak 6-7, and may represented partial sporadic patients.\n\nOutbreak 4 and Tibetan students should belong to the new type of non-perforated appendicitis because they had the same epidemiological, clinical and histological features as Tibetan students. Most patients had normal body temperature, WBC and NC, and unique histological features with hemorrhage and infiltration by eosinophils.\n\nOutbreak 5 also belongs to non-perforated appendicitis and its patients have elevated WBC and NC. Their histological and clinical features were similar to sporadic non-perforated appendicitis and may represent sporadic non-perforated appendicitis.\n\nWe have presented 8 outbreaks of appendicitis occurring in 6 provinces and autonomous regions in China.

All clusters/outbreaks of appendicitis occurred in group living units. The features of distribution will provide methods to find new cluster/outbreak. Because appendicitis is not endemic disease, cluster/outbreak of appendicitis should also occur widely worldwide and can be found using same methods as we did in China. In fact, cluster/outbreak of appendicitis occurred more frequently than we realized in this paper. For example, we did not report 3 other schools where cluster/outbreak of appendicitis occurred in Tibetan students, because these schools were not willing to collaborate with us.\n\nThrough field investigation and literature review, we found two classic entities of appendicitis and two non-perforated appendicitis including a new entity of appendicitis.\n\nCluster/outbreak 3 and cluster/outbreak 6-7 may represent majority of sporadic patients with classic appendicitis because their natural history, historical and clinical features were identical to that of the sporadic patients. Cluster/outbreak1-2, may represent partial sporadic patients with obvious gastrointestinal manifestations. The cluster of appendicitis occurring in the United States was also caused by food-borne transmission and belongs to classic appendicitis because perforation occurred in 31 percent of patients 32 , which indicate that appendicitis caused by food-borne transmission occurred worldwide.\n\nCluster/outbreak 5 was identical to features of sporadic non-perforated appendicitis and may represent majority of patients with this disease.\n\nTibetan students and patients in cluster/outbreak 4 represented a new entity of appendicitis. Because they had the following features: (1) Pathologically, the resected appendices revealed hemorrhage with infiltration by lymphocytes and eosinophils. The All rights reserved.

(3) In epidemiology, there were the occurrence of clustering; Female patients were more common than male patients and they had a history of mutual contact before the onset of symptoms; New students had higher susceptibility. Cluster can be controlled through isolation of visitors and disinfection as evidenced in 2003 for prevention of SARS among Tibetan students. Considering that histological features of Tibetan students and cluster/outbreak 4 revealed not only hemorrhage in appendiceal tissues but also infiltration by eosinphils and so forth, we tentatively re-named \"acute hemorrhagic appendicitis 33 \" to \"acute hemorrhagic and eosinophil-infiltrated appendicitis.\" Although there are 2 patients with gangrenous appendicitis in Tibetan students, the incidence rate is very low. The reason is during 10-\n\nyear period, partial patients may have classic appendicitis.\n\nCompared with cluster 4, the cluster among Tibetan students lasted much longer and showed much higher incidence rates. We are surprised to find out that incidence rate of the female students enrolled in 2003 and 2004 who had surgical operations because appendicitis were 44.7% (21 of 47) and 42.4% (14 of 33) respectively. This may be since Tibetan students were from more remote and isolated areas, they were more susceptible in their new environment.\n\nThe patients' time of this new type of appendicitis was much longer (4.7 day on average for Tibetan students) than that of sporadic appendicitis. Some study showed that patients' time of 12, 24 and 36 hours increased relative risk for perforated appendicitis 23 .\n\nAll rights reserved.

The reasons are as follows: According to living habits of Tibetan female students and analysis of history of mutual contact, we postulated that Tibetan students' appendicitis resulted from indirect contact transmission; Finding of Fusobacterium nucleatum/necrophorum in cluster/outbreak 4 suggested that our infectious hypothesis is reasonable; 34 Incidence rate of appendicitis decreased after intervention of life style and health habit; Analysis of susceptibility indicated that new students have higher susceptibility.\n\nLike Tibetan students, the other cluster/outbreak also showed features of infectious disease in epidemiology. The students and soldiers from remote areas, the minorities, and female students and the new comers are more susceptible than native students and soldiers. 31, [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] High attack rates in female students were associated with their living habit 33 . New endemic location can form and persist for years and decades. 38, [40] [41] [42] [43] Transmission routes were associated with food borne transmission 37, 39 and indirect contact transmission; 33 Incidence rate of appendicitis lower after intervention of life style and health habit. 43 Many gastrointestinal diseases were reported to mimic symptoms of appendicitis. In several outbreaks induced by enteric pathogens, patients who had appendectomies were found to have normal appendices, 45-48 but our patients from cluster/outbreak had true appendicitis demonstrated by histological examination.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Except cluster/outbreak 5, the other cluster/outbreak occurred at least twice and lasted for many years. All 593 patients in cluster/outbreak included various histological features and representative. Our study meets the above requirement.\n\nSince 2009\uff0c new studies have provided evidence of association between microbiota and appendicitis. 10-14.50 Through studying patients in cluster/outbreak, the difference in microbiota between different entities of appendicitis or different stage of same entity may be confirmed. Further we may make etiological diagnosis for appendicitis and confirm proportion of communicable appendicitis and non-communicable appendicitis clinically, and in future, improve diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis.\n\nSome reports did not describe epidemiological features in detail [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] or did not provide data of elevated body temperature, 38, 39 WBC, 37-38, 42-43 NC 37-38 and/or average patient's time. 37, 38, 39, 40, 41 Estimation of incubation period is crude.\n\nWe demonstrated that cluster/outbreak of appendicitis is not unusual. There may be four entities of appendicitis including a new entity, which reveals the features of infectious diseases in epidemiology. The study of cluster/outbreak appendicitis can correct the bias caused by sporadic cases.\n\nNo conflict of interest was declared.\n\nAll rights reserved.
