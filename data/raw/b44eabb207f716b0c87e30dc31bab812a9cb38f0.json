{"title": "Buffalo: Mediterranean Region q", "body": "a dual-purpose line of buffaloes is maintained, and a maximum of 62% in Italy, where males have no market. In countries where the majority of buffaloes are reared in very small herds there are also a few bigger private, cooperative or state herds (Bulgaria, Egypt and Turkey) ( Figure 1 ).\n\nThe number of calves produced per cow per year varies from 0.5 in Egypt to 0.9 in Azerbaijan and Syria, with average of 0.7. The age at first calving averages 36 months. In Italy a good proportion of buffaloes calve at 28 months of age, whereas in Egypt and Syria a high number are 40 months or more at first calving.\n\nIn Mediterranean countries, all herds have their own bull except in the areas with very small herds (2-3 breedable buffaloes) in Romania, Bulgaria, Egypt and Turkey, where there are groups of bulls for breeding at village level.\n\nOfficial milk recording for the productivity of buffaloes is performed in Egypt, Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, the United Kingdom, Azerbaijan and Iran. Genetic evaluation of buffaloes is done in Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Egypt, Iran and Azerbaijan.\n\nChoice of breeding bulls/heifers is made on the basis of: Where milk recording is not practiced, a better bull is judged on his appearance, size and strength. Natural breeding stations exist in Egypt and Bulgaria. Bulls in the breeding stations are provided by development programs of the government or other agencies. Due to difficulties in estrus detection and lack of organization, artificial insemination (AI) is still practiced only to a very limited extent for buffaloes in the Mediterranean region: in Italy for 2.5% of the buffaloes, in Egypt and Iran for 0.5% and in Romania for 0.1%. In the large cooperative and state farms in Bulgaria, AI is used on 80% of the buffaloes. In the other countries it is not used at all. The low use of AI has slowed down the implementation of national selection schemes for genetic improvement of milk productivity. Research trials conducted in Italy have indicated that artificial insemination is feasible and successful in buffaloes using the following technique to synchronize estrus and boost fertility. A progesterone-releasing intravaginal device (PRID) of silicon coils is inserted and left for 10 days; on the seventh day injections of 1000 IU of eCG (equine chorionic gonadotropin) and 15 mg of luprostiol (prostaglandin F 2a ) are given; artificial insemination is performed at 48, 72 and 96 h after removal of the PRID on day 10.\n\nThe most common housing system is that referred to as 'traditional,' consisting of keeping buffaloes indoors at night and confined in fenced areas during the day (Egypt, Turkey, Iraq, Syria); in the favorable season they are allowed to graze during the day (Romania, Turkey and on some farms in Italy). In the marshes in the southwest of Iran, buffaloes are kept outdoors on pasture throughout the year, whereas in the northern areas, around the Caspian Sea, they are kept in barns in winter. Lactating buffaloes are kept tied throughout the year in Bulgaria, Romania and Azerbaijan. In Italy, they are housed loose in paddocks all year, with the same modern systems used for dairy cows; one-third of Italian buffaloes are also put on pasture in spring. One-third of Iraqi buffaloes wallow in marshes all year, the water reaching a level halfway up their bodies. They swim far and wide to find food and when the water is high, they stand on platforms made of papyrus, reeds and mud; on these platforms the farmers sometimes build huts to house the buffaloes; these platforms can be pushed to different places in the marshes.\n\nThe length of lactation varies from 200 to 290 days, the most frequent being 260. Average lactation milk yield is 1600 kg. Italian buffaloes give the highest average yield (almost 2000 kg) (Figure 2) , while in Turkey, average yield is below 1000 kg. In the Iraqi marshes buffaloes produce no more than 700 kg in 180 days. The fat content of the milk throughout the lactation is over 8% in Italy, Turkey, Azerbaijan and Iraq, around 7% in Bulgaria, Romania and Egypt, and less than 7% in Iran.\n\nThe average daily milk yield of river buffaloes shows very wide variability, depending on the breed, the country and especially the management and feeding system. It can range from 3 to 4 kg day \u00c01 for poorly fed animals (grazing and fed by products) to 15 kg day \u00c01 in intensive management systems.\n\nIn the large commercial herds in Italy and Bulgaria, buffaloes are machine-milked, twice a day. In the smaller herds elsewhere in the Mediterranean, buffaloes are usually hand-milked, and often the calf is allowed to stand with its dam to assist letdown which otherwise may be slow.\n\nExtensive management systems, as practiced in Europe and the Near East, include grazing in the favorable seasons. In all cases, green forage 'cut-and-carry'composed of legumes varying from country to countryconcentrates and by-products are the basic foodstuff. Green forage and hay are made mainly of lucerne (alfalfa) in Italy, Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey and Trifolium alexandrinum in Egypt. The most common by-products fed to buffaloes are brewers' grains in Italy and Bulgaria, sugarbeet pulp in Italy, Bulgaria and Iran, cotton waste in Egypt and Azerbaijan, tomato peel in Italy, apple-juice wastes in Iran, sugar cane wastes in Egypt and Iran, maize stalk and cobs in Iran, Egypt and Romania and straw everywhere.\n\nIn the Iraqi marshes, when the buffaloes return at night to the floating islands where they live, they are fed green forage cut by the farmer during the day; this forage is composed of reeds, papyrus, various water plants, and rice hulls when available. In Italy, dairy buffaloes are managed in the same intensive way as dairy cows, maintained in loose housing paddocks throughout the year. Maize silage and grass silage are the main feeds. Average yearly milk production for buffaloes in Italy is 2000 kg although 5% of recorded buffaloes yield more than 3000 kg. An example of feeding schedules for high-yielding buffaloes is given in Table 1 .\n\nSimilar high-energy diets (0.80-0.85 milk feed units (MFU) kg \u00c01 dry matter) are used in Italy for particular selected genotypes where highest milk yield is desired because of the high prices for buffalo milk and because such diets increase milk protein (4.5-5.0%) and milk fat (8-9%) resulting in higher cheese yields.\n\nBuffalo pathologies are similar to those described for cattle. Few diseases are peculiar to buffaloes. They tend to show more resistance to diseases than cattle, perhaps because of their adaptation to hot-humid climates. \n\nParasitic infections, particularly in developing countries, are very common in buffaloes. They include: gastrointestinal helminths (Strongyloides, Toxocara, Moniezia, Mammomonogamus) and coccidia (Eimeria, Giardia, Cryptosporidium), liver parasites (Fasciola), tick parasites (Hyalomma, Sarcoptes) blood parasites (Theileria), all of which produce important economic losses in buffalo breeding.\n\nEscherichia coli can cause gastroenteric pathologies in buffaloes, particularly in calves, associated with other bacteria (Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella) or with coccidia or verminosis or virosis. Respiratory diseases are caused by Pasteurella, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, E. coli, and can result in high mortality, if the animals are not treated with antibiotics. Pasteurella multicida is responsible for hemorrhagic septicemia, the most serious disease in buffaloes because of the high mortality particularly in tropical Asian countries; however, it can be controlled with antibiotics and vaccines. Tuberculosis, produced by Mycobacterium, is a serious zoonosis, which could be eradicated after tuberculin diagnosis. Brucellosis, caused by Brucella, is another zoonosis that needs to be eradicated after serological diagnosis. It can cause serious disease in the human population and reproductive disorders and infertility in buffaloes. Vaccination can be applied only in developing countries.\n\nLeptospirosis is another zoonosis, produced by infection with Leptospira from water sources contaminated by rodents. Listeriosis, caused by Listeria, produces meningoencephalitis, abortion and septicemia: the source of the infection may be silage in the buffaloes' diet. Chlamydia, Rickettsia and Johne's disease (caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis) are present even in developed countries also, and the evidence of mastitis incidence links them to dairy buffaloes.\n\nProphylaxis is very important to control some viral infections that could cause neonatal diarrhea (Rotavirus, Coronavirus), particularly in intensive systems. Bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), bovine diarrhea (BVD) and bovine herpesvirus (BHV) have all been diffused by animals in intensive buffalo farms. Buffaloes are also susceptible to foot-and-mouth disease.\n\nBuffaloes are affected by fungal infections, tumors and reproductive disorders including prolapse of the uterus.\n\nCompared to that of cattle, buffalo milk is richer in fat (6-9.5%) and protein (4-5%); it has a lower cholesterol content and higher tocopherol content. It is richer in calcium and phosphorus and has less sodium and potassium. Peroxidase activity is 2-4 times higher than in cows' milk so that it can be preserved longer; b-carotene is more completely transformed to retinol and therefore the milk looks whiter than cows' milk. The milk can be consumed in liquid form or processed into a wide range of products, either alone or mixed with milk from other livestock: fermented milks, butter, ghee, condensed and powdered milk, and cheeses are produced.\n\nMany farms produce their own cheese and cream which they sell directly. Classifying the types of cheese according to water content, the following are typical:"}
