{"title": "Article PI4KB on Inclusion Bodies Formed by ER Membrane Remodeling Facilitates Replication of Human Parainfluenza Virus Type 3", "body": "Many positive-strand RNA viruses reorganize the endomembrane to form specialized replication organelles. However, whether negative-strand RNA viruses use intracellular membranes for replication is largely unknown. Li et al. demonstrate that inclusion bodies of HPIV3 induce ER membrane rearrangement. PI4KB is recruited to IBs to generate PI4P, which facilitates viral replication.\n\nViruses rely on their host for viability and replication, and the host cell provides not only nucleotides and amino acids for viral metabolism but also a structural platform for viral replication and assembly (Belov and van Kuppeveld, 2012; Salonen et al., 2005) . Positive-strand RNA viruses and even some DNA viruses, such as vaccinia virus, remodel intracellular membranes to form their replication organelles (ROs) (Miller and Krijnse-Locker, 2008; Salonen et al., 2005; Schwartz et al., 2004) . Different viruses rely on different organelles, and the appearance of ROs is manifold. For example, during infection, hepatitis C virus (HCV), dengue virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and arterivirus induce positive curvature of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, forming discrete membrane vesicles (Knoops et al., 2008 (Knoops et al., , 2012 Romero-Brey et al., 2012; Welsch et al., 2009) . Cells infected with poliovirus, coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3), and rhinovirus contain many complex and dynamic structures that originate from the cis-Golgi membrane (Belov and Sztul, 2014; Roulin et al., 2014) . Flock House virus (FHV) induces formation of spherules with negative curvature on the mitochondrial membrane (Kopek et al., 2007) . Electron microscopy of the replication structure of tomato bushy stunt virus showed that ROs were generated from the peroxisome membrane (McCartney et al., 2005) .\n\nPositive-strand RNA viruses remodel intracellular membranes to form replication sites that contain unique lipids and proteins distinct from the original organelles, in which phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4K) is a common component. PI4K contains four isoforms: PI4KA, PI4KB, PI4K2A, and PI4K2B (Roulin et al., 2014) . In general, PI4K is recruited to replication sites via its interaction with viral proteins directly or with the help of cytokines, such as GBF1/ARF1 or ACBD3 (Hsu et al., 2010; Lei et al., 2017; Sasaki et al., 2012; Xiao et al., 2017) . Then, PI4K yields phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) on ROs to bind and induce conformational changes in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to modulate RdRp activity (Hsu et al., 2010) . Moreover, PI4P locally changes the RO membrane curvature during viral infection to generate a high-curvature membrane pocket to shield viral components from host defense (Belov and van Kuppeveld, 2012; Miller and Krijnse-Locker, 2008 ). In addition, PI4P is exchanged with cholesterol to maintain essential membrane properties that determine the shape and function of ROs (Roulin et al., 2014) . However, whether PI4K is required for negative-strand RNA viral replication has not been explored, possibly because the existence of ROs in negative-strand RNA viruses has not been confirmed.\n\nA variety of animal viruses, such as DNA viruses (e.g., poxviruses and herpesviruses) and some RNA viruses (e.g., reovirus, togavirus, bunyavirus), form inclusion bodies (IBs) or viroplasms, which have been speculated to be viral replication factories (Netherton et al., 2007; Novoa et al., 2005a) , but we know little about the organization and composition of IBs. Recent studies of double-strand RNA viruses (e.g., wheat yellow mosaic virus and reovirus) showed that these viruses take advantage of the ER membrane to form IBs, and IBs are thought to derive from the ER (Fern\u00e1 ndez de Castro et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2014) . In addition, a few reports have suggested that negative-strand RNA viruses may also remodel the endomembrane to form IBs. For example, ribosomes have been found close to Ebola virus IBs, suggesting that IBs of Ebola virus may form near rough ER, although the ER structure was not clearly detected (Nelson et al., 2016) . Negri body-like structures (NBLs) are sites of rabies for 24 h to form IBs and analyzed for colocalization of the Golgi protein TGN46 (A), the mitochondrial protein Tom20 (B), the ER protein Calnexin (C), the ER protein PDI (D), and IBs. The fluorescence intensity profile of IBs (green) and organelle proteins (red) was measured along the line drawn on a 23 zoom panel by Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence Lite. (E and F) HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-tagged P were infected with HPIV3 (MOI = 0.1) for consecutive times (0 h, 12 h, 24 h, 30 h, and 36 h) and analyzed for distribution of the ER proteins Calnexin (E) and PDI (F). Yellow arrows indicate representative colocalization of ER proteins and IBs.\n\n(legend continued on next page) virus RNA synthesis, and electron microscopy observations have indicated that NBLs are progressively associated with a double membrane that may have been derived from the rough ER (Nikolic et al., 2017) . Bunyamwera virus infection induces fragmented Golgi stacks, where assembly and maturation take place (Novoa et al., 2005b; Salanueva et al., 2003) . Oropouche virus attracts endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery components to modify Golgi cisternae, forming viral factory units (Barbosa et al., 2018) . However, compared with positive-strand RNA viruses, the IB formation mechanisms of many negative-strand RNA viruses remain unexplored.\n\nHuman parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3), a classical enveloped negative-strand RNA virus, is in the Paramyxoviridae family. HPIV3 infection can also induce formation of IBs. Its genome encodes six structural proteins: nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), polymerase (L), matrix protein (M), and two spike glycoproteins consisting of hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN) and fusion protein (F) (Moscona, 2005) . Our previous study showed that the association of N and P is the minimum requirement for formation of IBs. A mutant of N, N L478A , was unable to interact with P and failed to induce formation of IBs when co-expressed with P (Zhang et al., 2013) . HPIV3 can cause serious respiratory diseases in children and infants. However, no effective treatments exist; thus, further exploration of IB organization and the cytokines involved in executing IB function can enhance our understanding of HPIV3 replication mechanisms so that we can better develop antiviral therapies or vaccines.\n\nIn the current study, we focused on the in situ properties of the viral RNA replication structures in cells infected with paramyxoviruses. We demonstrate that HPIV3 remodels the ER membrane to form IBs. P recruits PI4KB to IBs, and PI4KB on IBs produces a PI4P lipid microenvironment, which reinforces IB structures and facilitates HPIV3 replication. Finally, we found that another paramyxovirus, human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), also takes advantage of the ER membrane to modulate the formation of IBs and that PI4P is also rich in HRSV IBs. The N of HRSV interacts with PI4KB and recruits PI4KB to IBs.\n\nOur previous results showed that expression of HPIV3 N and P is the minimum requirement for viral IB formation and that IBs are replication sites for HPIV3 (Zhang et al., 2013 . To determine whether the IBs of HPIV3 bear membrane structures and to assess the relationship between HPIV3 IBs and the endomembrane, we first sought to determine localization changes of organelle marker proteins during IB formation. After HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids encoding N and P for 24 h, we found that the distribution of the Golgi marker protein TGN46 and the mitochondrial marker protein Tom20 remained un-changed ( Figures 1A and 1B) . However, the ER marker protein Calnexin formed aggregates and colocalized with viral IBs (Figure 1C) , and the expression of N or P alone failed to induce formation of aggregates by Calnexin ( Figure S1A ), suggesting that re-localization of Calnexin was induced only during IB formation.\n\nNext we assessed another ER protein, PDI, and a similar conclusion was reached ( Figures 1D and S1B ). To exclude bleed-through from the green channel into the red channel, HeLa cells were transfected with N-Myc and HA-P and only stained for cellular marker proteins, using the same acquisition parameters for the red channel as used for imaging of TGN46, Tom20, Calnexin, and PDI. We found that Calnexin and PDI still formed aggregates but that the distribution of TGN46 and Tom20 remained unchanged (Figures S1C-S1F). Next we sought to determine how ER marker proteins are recruited to IBs, and we were not able to show interaction of either N or P with Calnexin or PDI (Figures S1G-S1J), suggesting that the distribution changes and colocalization of Calnexin or PDI with IBs were not achieved through their interaction with N or P. To determine whether HPIV3 infection induces ER marker proteins to form aggregates, we infected HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-tagged P with HPIV3 (MOI = 0.1) for up to 36 h and analyzed the distribution of Calnexin and PDI at different time points post-infection (p.i.). As infection progressed, small IBs were observed at the early stage of infection (24 h p.i.) and gradually became larger at 30 h and 36 h p.i. At the same time, the aggregates of Calnexin and PDI also gradually became larger and colocalized with IBs ( Figures 1E and 1F ). Of note, the expression levels of Calnexin and PDI remained unchanged (Figures S1K and S1L), suggesting that IBs only change the distribution of ER proteins, not the amount of protein.\n\nTo gain insight into the dynamic fusion of ER proteins with IBs, live-cell imaging was performed. For this, HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-tagged P were infected with HPIV3 (MOI = 0.1) and transfected with a plasmid that expressed the mCherrytagged Calnexin protein. Upon IB fusion, Calnexin aggregates also became bigger. We found that Calnexin could be detected on the surface of small IBs and fused with IBs, which reflected the gradual absorption and integration of Calnexin by IBs (Figure 1G ; Video S1). Taken together, these results suggest that HPIV3 changes the distribution of ER components and recruits them to IBs; thus, the ER membrane might be remodeled and serve as a source of IB components for viral replication.\n\nHPIV3 IBs Are Surrounded by a Fragmented ER Membrane, and IB Formation Depends on the ER To confirm the relationship between HPIV3 IBs and the ER, we used transmission electron microscopy to observe the ultrastructure of the ER and IBs. When HeLa cells were transfected with an empty vector or a vector encoding N L478 and P, HeLa cells were unable to form IBs and were enriched with integrated ER structures. In contrast, when HeLa cells were co-transfected (G) Kinetic process of the ER protein Calnexin fusing into IBs. HeLa cells expressing GFP-tagged P were seeded into 20-mm dishes for 24 h, infected with HPIV3 (MOI = 0.1), transfected with mCherry-Calnexin (0.5 mg), and visualized by live-cell imaging. The fusion event is marked with white arrows and numbers. In (a) and (b), white arrows indicate Calnexin protein (red) attached to small IBs (green) fused into small IBs to form a homogeneous structure. In (b) and (c), 1 and 2 fused into 3. In (d) and (e), arrow 4 indicates that Calnexin was absorbed into small IBs. In (f)-(h), 3 and 4 fused into 7 and 5 and 6 fused into 8. In (i) and (j), 7 and 8 fused into 9. Scale bars, 10 mm. See also Figure S1 .\n\n(legend on next page) with plasmids encoding N and P to form IBs, the number of classical ER structures was significantly reduced, and we observed many fragmented ER structures around IBs. Moreover, we detected fragmented ER structures that closely surrounded IBs in HPIV3-infected HeLa cells (Figure 2A ), suggesting that HPIV3 IBs induced ER fragmentation, and debris from the ER surrounded and was attached to IBs. Next, HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-tagged P were infected with HPIV3 (MOI = 0.1) for 36 h. Through Airyscan super-resolution microscopy, we found that Calnexin colocalized with IBs, and surface projections of three-dimensional reconstructions showed that ER membrane fragments existed near IBs ( Figure 2B ), which suggests that IBs were surrounded by a fragmented ER membrane. To confirm whether IBs contained membrane structures derived from the ER, HeLa cells were treated with a hypotonic solution and lysed with a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was left untreated or treated with Triton X-100, trypsin, or Triton X-100 plus trypsin. In the homogenate treated with trypsin, N and P were not completely digested (Figures 2C, lane 3, and 2D), but N L478A and P were completely digested (Figures 2C, lane 7, and 2D), suggesting that the fragmented ER membrane around IBs protected N and P from degradation by trypsin.\n\nNext, we used the ER stress inducers thapsigargin (Tg) and tunicamycin (Tu) to disrupt the structure of the ER. When HeLa cells were treated with Tg for 3 h or Tu for 6 h, proteolytic cleavage of ATF6 (an ER stress-regulated transmembrane transcription factor) was induced, and XBP1s protein was expressed ( Figure S2A ), which demonstrates that Tg and Tu can induce classic ER stress. Of note, Tg and Tu had no effects on the metabolic activity of cells ( Figure S2B ). HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids encoding N-Myc and HA-P and then treated with Tu. We calculated the average number of IBs per cell and the average diameter of IBs and found that, although Calnexin and PDI were still distributed to IBs, the size of IBs in Tu-treated cells was significantly smaller and the number of IBs was lower than that in untreated cells , and a comparable result was reached when cells were treated with Tg (data not shown). HPIV3 replication was also significantly suppressed ( Figures 2H-2J ), suggesting that formation of HPIV3 IBs and HPIV3 replication rely on the ER. Of note, expression of N and P was not influenced by treatment with Tg and Tu ( Figure S2D ), which demonstrates that the inhibition of IB formation by Tg and Tu is not due to expression of N and P. In contrast, EV71 replication was not inhibited by Tg or Tu treatment (Figures S2E and S2F) , which indicates that EV71 replication site formation does not mainly rely on the ER. Furthermore, we found that the components of IBs, N and P, were enriched in purified ER (Figures 2K, lane 3, 2L, and 2M). Because of their inability to induce IB formation, N L478A and P were not enriched in purified ER (Figures 2K, lane 4, 2L, and 2M ). In addition, N and P were not enriched in purified mitochondria ( Figure S2G ). Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that HPIV3 IBs might be derived from the ER by inducing ER fragmentation and recruiting ER ingredients.\n\nPositive-strand RNA viruses remodel the endomembrane to form ROs rather than directly replicating on original organelles, primarily because these ROs possess unique characteristics, such as abundant PI4P, which is critical for viral replication. Thus, we sought to determine whether and how HPIV3 IBs become enriched with PI4P to facilitate replication. First, we found that abundant PI4P localized on IBs in transfected and HPIV3-infected cells ( Figures 3A and 3B ). In addition, to exclude bleed-through from the green channel into the red channel, we only stained for PI4P, using the same acquisition parameters for the red channel as used for imaging of PI4P, and we found that PI4P still formed aggregates ( Figure S3 ), suggesting that HPIV3 also takes advantage of lipid synthesis pathways to replenish ROs with PI4P.\n\nPI4P on IBs Is Generated by PI4KB PI4P is generated by PI4K, which comprises four isoforms: PI4KA, PI4KB, PI4K2A, and PI4K2B. To determine which PI4K (B) Surface projections of a three-dimensional reconstruction with accumulations of fragmented ER membranes around IBs. HeLa cells expressing GFP-tagged P were mock-treated or infected with HPIV3 (MOI = 0.1), transfected with mcherry-Calnexin for 36 h, and analyzed via Zeiss Airyscan Super-resolution microscopy. Representative Airyscan images were acquired without pixel saturation. Boxed regions were magnified and processed to a three-dimensional surface reconstruction. (C) HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids for 24 h. Cell lysates were harvested and treated with a hypotonic solution for 20 min and broken with a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was left untreated or treated with Triton X-100, trypsin, or Triton X-100 plus trypsin and analyzed via WB. (D) HeLa cells are treated in the way described above, and the contents of N and P protein were analyzed to determine quantity by Quantity one software. (E-G) Effects of the ER stress inducer Tu on IB formation. HeLa cells were transfected with N-Myc and HA-P for 12 h, treated with Tu (2 mg/mL) for 6 h, and analyzed for the location of Calnexin and the size and number of IBs. Representative images are shown (E). Also shown are quantitative analysis of the average number of IBs per cell treated with DMSO or Tu (F; n = 3, 50 cells were counted) and quantitative analysis of the average diameter of IBs treated with DMSO or Tu (G; n = 3, 100 IBs were counted).\n\n(H-J) Effects of the ER stress inducers Tg and Tu on HPIV3 replication. HeLa cells were infected with HPIV3 (MOI = 0.1) for 12 h and treated with Tg (1 mM) for 3 h or Tu (2 mg/mL) for 6 h. The HPIV3 protein HN was analyzed via western blot (WB) (H), extracellular viral production was analyzed via plaque assay (I), and HPIV3 RNA was analyzed by qPCR (J). (K-M) The IB components N and P were rich in rough ER. HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids encoding N-Myc (0.5 mg) and HA-P (2 mg) or N L478A -Myc (0.5 mg) and HA-P (2 mg) for 24 h, and the RER was extracted to detect IB composition. Representative images are shown (K). Also shown is quantitative analysis of the N or N L478A and P content in rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) when expressing IBs (N and P) or non-IBs (N L478A and P) (L and M). Images are representative of experiments carried out at least three times. Error bars, mean \u00b1 SD of three experiments (n = 3). Student's t test, + p < 0.05, ++ p < 0.01, +++ p < 0.001.

See also Figure S2 .\n\nwas involved in the generation of PI4P on IBs, we first assessed the proximity of the four PI4K isoforms to IBs via immunofluorescence and found that neither PI4KA nor PI4K2A was recruited to IBs ( Figures S4A and S4E) . Furthermore, using a pool of small interfering RNAs directed against the known PI4Ks, we found that HPIV3 replication was not significantly affected in cells treated with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting PI4KA or PI4K2A ( Figures S4B-S4D and S4F-S4H), suggesting that neither PI4KA nor PI4K2A was involved in generating PI4P on IBs and was not required for HPIV3 replication. Although PI4KB and PI4K2B colocalized with IBs ( Figures 4A and S4I ), viral replication was significantly reduced only in cells treated with shRNA targeting PI4KB (Figures 4B-4D) but not PI4K2B ( Figures S4J-S4L) , suggesting that PI4KB was involved in generation of PI4P on IBs.\n\nTo confirm the colocalization of PI4KB and IBs, we also examined endogenous PI4KB and found that endogenous PI4KB aggregated and colocalized with IBs in transfected and HPIV3infected cells ( Figures 4E and 4F) , whereas neither N nor P alone could induce PI4KB accumulation on IBs (Figures S4M and S4N). To exclude the bleed-through from the green channel into the red channel, HeLa cells were transfected with N-Myc, HA-P, and FLAG-PI4KB or N-Myc and HA-P, and stained for only PI4KB, using the same acquisition parameters for the red channel as used for imaging of FLAG and PI4KB, and we found that PI4KB still formed aggregates ( Figures S4O and  S4P ). Moreover, PI4KB was present in purified ER of HeLa cells expressing IBs but not in purified ER of HeLa cells expressing N L478A and P (Figures 4G, lanes 3 and 4, and 4H). Taken together, these results show that HPIV3 recruits PI4KB to IBs to generate PI4P, resulting in enrichment of PI4P on IBs derived from the ER.\n\nTo confirm the relationship between PI4KB and HPIV3 replication, we employed the PI4KB-specific inhibitor PIK93 at a concentration of 2-4 mM ( Figure S5A ), which had minimal effects on the metabolic activity of cells ( Figure S5B ). When cells were treated with PIK93, PI4P generation on IBs declined significantly compared with DMSO-treated cells ( Figure 5A ). Simultaneously, HPIV3 replication was apparently decreased (Figures 5B-5D ). Of note, PIK93 did not influence the expression of PI4KB and its colocalization on IBs (Figures S5C and S5D) . Furthermore, we carried out a recovery experiment and found that HPIV3 replication was strongly inhibited when cells were treated with shRNA targeting PI4KB and was rescued by expression of wild-type PI4KB, but HPIV3 replication was not rescued by expression of a functionally inactivated mutant of PI4KB, KD-PI4KB ( Figures 5E-5G) . Correspondingly, generation of PI4P on IBs was also reduced, and expression of wild-type PI4KB, but not KD-PI4KB, restored the levels of PI4P on IBs in PI4KB knockdown cells ( Figure S5E ). Of note, KD-PI4KB was also recruited to IBs but lost the ability to generate PI4P (Figure S5F ). Next, to determine whether PI4KB or PI4P directly supports viral genome replication, an HPIV3 minigenome assay was performed with increasing amounts of FLAG-tagged PI4KB. The results showed that PI4KB increased the minigenome-encoded reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 5H ). In our experiment, HPIV3 minigenome-encoded reporter expression was driven by vTF7-3 (a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase), whereas it has been reported that the H7 protein of vaccinia virus binds PI4P, which is essential for poxvirus replication (Kolli et al., 2015) . To exclude the possibility that the increase in minigenome reporter activity was due to the effect of PI4KB on vTF7-3, a control plasmid that encodes Renilla luciferase under control of the T7 promoter was constructed. The activity of Renilla luciferase was adjusted to a level comparable with that of the minigenome firefly luciferase ( Figure 5I, lanes  1 and 3) . Then, plasmids expressing PI4KB were co-transfected (G and H) HeLa cells were transfected with N-Myc (0.5 mg) and HA-P (2 mg) for 24 h, and the ER was extracted to detect PI4KB in RER when expressing IBs (N and P) or non-IBs (N L478A and P) via WB. Representative images are shown (G). Also shown is quantitative analysis of the PI4KB content in RER when expressing IBs (N and P) or non-IBs (N L478A and P) (H). Images are representative of experiments carried out at least three times. Error bars, mean \u00b1 SD of three experiments (n = 3). Student's t test; + p < 0.05, ++ p < 0.01, +++ p < 0.001; ns, non-significant. Scale bars, 10 mm. See also Figure S4 . (legend continued on next page) with pGBKT7-Renilla luciferase and the minigenome assay components, respectively. We found a significant increase in the activity of minigenome-encoded firefly luciferase and almost no increase in the activity of Renilla luciferase ( Figure 5I, lanes 2  and 4) . Taken together, these results show that PI4KB facilitates HPIV3 genome replication directly by producing PI4P on IBs.\n\nPI4KB Is Recruited to IBs via Its Interaction with P Next, we sought to determine how PI4KB is recruited to IBs. Previous studies of positive-strand RNA viruses showed that multiple picornaviruses utilize viral proteins, particularly 3A, to recruit PI4KB to ROs, and that 3A colocalizes with ROs (Greninger et al., 2012; Xiao et al., 2017) . Given that the HPIV3 proteins N and P are major components of IBs, we first determined whether N or P was involved in PI4KB recruitment, and we found that FLAG-PI4KB strongly interacted with HA-P ( Figure 6A ). Likewise, HA-P significantly interacted with FLAG-PI4KB ( Figure 6B ), and HA-P interacted with endogenous PI4KB ( Figure 6C ). These results confirm that P and PI4KB physically interact on IBs. However, we found no interaction between N and PI4KB ( Figures  6D and 6E) .\n\nNext, N-Myc, HA-P, and FLAG-PI4KB were co-expressed in HEK293T cells, and, surprisingly, we found that FLAG-PI4KB interacted with N-Myc ( Figure 6F) , suggesting that N interacts with PI4KB via the N-P complex. Finally, we employed a mutant, N L478A , which fails to interact with P, and found that N, but not N L478A , was able to interact with FLAG-PI4KB in the presence of P ( Figure 6G ). To confirm that P but not N was associated with PI4KB, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) in HeLa cells, and a comparable conclusion was reached ( Figures  S6A and S6B ). Taken together, these results show that P is responsible for PI4KB recruitment to IBs via its interaction with PI4KB.\n\nBased on the aforementioned results, we concluded that HPIV3 reorganizes ER membranes to form IBs and that P recruits PI4KB to IBs to generate PI4P to facilitate HPIV3 replication. Next, we sought to determine whether other paramyxoviruses, such as HRSV, use similar mechanisms to generate PI4P on IBs. First, we found that the ER marker protein Calnexin neither aggregated nor colocalized with HRSV IBs ( Figure 7A ). However, another ER marker protein, PDI, formed aggregates and colocalized with IBs ( Figure 7B ). Furthermore, PDI did not aggregate when N or P of HRSV was expressed alone ( Figure S7A ), suggesting that HRSV may also take advantage of the ER membrane to form IBs; however, the components absorbed and utilized are different from those utilized by HPIV3. Second, we found that PI4P lipids and PI4KB were also rich in HRSV IBs (Figures 7C and 7D ) and that PI4KB did not aggregate when N or P of HRSV was expressed alone ( Figure S7B ), suggesting that HRSV also recruited PI4KB to produce PI4P on IBs. Finally, we found that N, but not P, of HRSV strongly interacted with FLAG-PI4KB ( Figures 7E and  7F) . Furthermore, PI4KB interacted with P of HRSV via the N-P complex ( Figure 7G ). Taken together, these data demonstrate that HRSV also takes advantage of the ER and that PI4P lipids are enriched in IBs. The HRSV N protein recruits PI4KB to generate PI4P on IBs.\n\nIn summary, we show that, similar to positive-strand RNA viruses, the negative-strand RNA viruses HPIV3 and HRSV also remodel the endomembrane to form their replication factories (Figures 1, 2 , 7A, and 7B), namely IBs, which are enriched with PI4P lipids (Figures 3 and 7C) . The PI4P lipid microenvironment is an important facilitator of HPIV3 replication, and cellular PI4KB is a key player in this process ( Figure 5 ). These findings highlight the dependence on the endomembrane and PI4P among negative-strand RNA viruses and should prompt related studies to determine the mechanism by which PI4P lipids modulate viral RNA replication. Furthermore, our findings may provide a basis for the design of a class of therapeutic agents that target the negative-strand RNA viral replication platform.\n\nBased on our findings, we propose the following model for reorganization of the ER membrane in HPIV3 infection, which generates PI4P lipid-enriched IBs. In infected cells, HPIV3 translates mRNA into N and P, and increasing amounts of N and P result in ER membrane fragmentation. ER ingredients (such as Calnexin and PDI) and N and P form IBs together. Meanwhile, ER debris is loosely distributed around IBs. Subsequently, P recruits PI4KB to IBs, where it catalyzes the production of PI4P lipids, leading to biogenesis of a PI4P-enriched microenvironment, which facilitates HPIV3 replication.\n\nEV71 replication was not inhibited by Tg or Tu treatment, which indicates that EV71 replication site formation did not rely on the ER (Figures S2E and S2F) . Consistent with this finding, previous studies have reported that the ROs of EV71, CVB3, and poliovirus are often located close to the cis-Golgi and that the secretory vesicle budding machinery might be (E-G) HeLa cells were infected with HPIV3 (MOI = 0.1) and transfected with the indicated plasmids. The HPIV3 protein HN was analyzed via WB (E), extracellular viral production was analyzed via plaque assay (F), and HPIV3 RNA was analyzed via qPCR (G). (H and I) PI4KB increases minigenome reporter activity. (H) The effect of PI4KB on minigenome reporter RNA synthesis. vTF7-3-infected HeLa cells were transfected with pGEM4-N (125 ng), pGEM4-P (62.5 ng), pGEM4-L (100 ng), pOCUS-HPIV3-MG (50 ng), and increasing amounts of plasmid encoding PI4KB (200 ng, 400 ng, 800 ng, and 1600 ng). Relative luciferase activity was measured according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression of N, P, and PI4KB was detected via WB, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a loading control. (I) PI4KB has no effect on vTF7-3. Plasmids encoding Renilla luciferase (5 ng) and plasmids encoding N, P, L, and the minigenome were transfected alone or together with FLAG-PI4KB (1600 ng) in vTF7-3 infected HeLa cells to exclude nonspecific effects of PI4KB on vTF7-3. Relative luciferase activity was measured, and expression of PI4KB was detected via WB. Images are representative of experiments carried out at least three times. Error bars, mean \u00b1 SD of three experiments (n = 3). Student's t test; + p < 0.05, ++ p < 0.01, +++ p < 0.001. Scale bars, 10 mm. See also Figure S5 .\n\ninvolved in RO formation Belov and Sztul, 2014; Greninger et al., 2012; Hsu et al., 2010; Limpens et al., 2011) . Furthermore, we found that PI4P was enriched on the IBs of paramyxoviruses just as it was enriched in the ROs of positive-strand RNA viruses. Therefore, we concluded that both positive-and negative-strand RNA viruses can remodel the endomembrane to form ROs and that they take advantage of lipid synthesis pathways to replenish ROs with PI4P to facilitate replication. In addition, we have a deeper understanding of paramyxovirus IB organization. IBs are not only the protein aggregates but also structures composed of ER ingredients and surrounded by a fragmented ER membrane. We found that the ER marker proteins Calnexin and PDI both colocalized with HPIV3 IBs (Figures 1C and 1D) ; however, only PDI colocalized with HRSV IBs (Figures 7A and 7B) . In other words, although HPIV3 and HRSV both take advantage of the ER membrane to form IBs, different viruses absorb different components of the ER, which implies the complexity of paramyxovirus IB organization. Similarly, previous studies considered the ER membrane to be the main membrane source of HCV ROs (Romero-Brey et al., 2012; Welsch et al., 2009 ). However, a recent study showed that the Golgi and autophagosome membrane are important for HCV replication and highlighted the complexity of the cellular membrane structures of positive-strand viruses (Hansen et al., 2017) . Interestingly, the autophagy marker LC3 was also found on HPIV3 IBs (data not shown), suggesting that autophagy may also play a role in IB formation. Consistent with this, our previous results showed that HPIV3 P blocks autophagosome-lysosome fusion to increase virus production (Ding et al., 2014) . Thus, we assume that P blocks autophagosome-lysosome fusion to increase the abundance of autophagosomes, and then HPIV3 takes advantage of autophagosomes other than the ER to form IBs. Moreover, a recent report showed that HRSV IBs contain subcompartments that were termed ''IB-associated granules'' (IBAGs), and that newly synthetized viral mRNA and the viral transcription anti-terminator M2-1 concentrate in IBAGs. In contrast, viral genome RNA, N, L, and its cofactor P are excluded from IBAGs (Rincheval et al., 2017) . Whether IBAGs are separated with other space of IBs by membrane structures is worth exploring. These findings provide substantial insights into the organization of IBs, which were previously thought to be aggregates of proteins. These findings suggest that IBs are extremely complex and elaborate structures, and understanding their composition could greatly help us understand the mechanisms of viral replication.\n\nROs of positive-strand RNA viruses promote efficient viral replication by anchoring the replication machinery in membrane compartments or by shielding it from host defense mechanisms (Netherton et al., 2007; Novoa et al., 2005a) . Electron microscopy showed that dengue virus-and HCV-induced membrane structures contain vesicle pores, which could enable release of newly synthesized viral RNA, and revealed budding of viral particles on ROs directly opposed to vesicle pores (Miyanari et al., 2007; Paul et al., 2014; Romero-Brey et al., 2012; Welsch et al., 2009) . Our results strongly suggest that the IBs of paramyxoviruses consist of membranous ingredients and that fragmented ER membranes loosely surround the core of HPIV3 IBs. On one hand, this membrane structure protects IBs from degradation to ensure viral replication (Figures 2C and 2D) . On the other hand, many cytokines are involved in viral replication, and the gaps between incompact ER debris ensure communication between IBs and the cytosol. Most importantly, our previous results showed that HPIV3 IBs escape the antiviral effect of stress granules by concealing their own newly synthesized viral RNAs (Hu et al., 2018) . Subsequently, loose ER membranes around IBs may create a favorable environment to transport synthesized viral RNA to the cytoplasm and escape the alarm system of host cells in a sustained-release manner.\n\nDuring positive-strand RNA virus replication, PI4P can recruit cellular proteins that have a PI4P-binding pleckstrin homology domain, such as the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP). OSBP exchanges cholesterol with PI4P on membrane contact sites between ROs and other organelles (Nchoutmboube et al., 2015; Roulin et al., 2014) , which generate and maintain essential membrane properties that drive the shape and function of ROs. However, we did not detect enriched cholesterol around IBs (data not shown), which suggests that HPIV3 replication and transcription do not rely on cholesterol. In addition, RdRp 3D pol of enterovirus preferentially binds PI4P lipids over other cellular lipid components (Hsu et al., 2010) , indicating that PI4P serves as a protein docking site on the RO membrane. Furthermore, PI4P lipid binding may also induce conformational changes and modulate RdRp enzymatic activity (Hsu et al., 2010) . The mechanism whereby PI4P facilitates HPIV3 replication is not clear.\n\nSeveral protein partners have been investigated for their involvement in PI4K recruitment to produce PI4P. PI4K is recruited to replication sites via its interaction with viral proteins directly or with the help of cytokines, such as GBF1/ARF1 or ACBD3 (Greninger et al., 2012; Hong et al., 2014; Sasaki et al., 2012; Xiao et al., 2017) . Here we found that recruitment of PI4KB to HPIV3 IBs depended on P ( Figures 6A-6C and S6B ). So far, we have not found any intermediate proteins involved in the process of recruitment.\n\nHCV nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) has been found to interact with PI4KA, and direct activation of a lipid kinase by HCV NS5A contributes critically to the integrity of the membranous ROs of HCV (Reiss et al., 2011) . However, when we inhibited PI4KB activity via PIK93 or reduced its expression via shRNA targeting PI4KB, the morphological characteristics of IBs were almost unaffected ( Figure 5A ; Figures S5D and S5E ). That is, PI4KB is involved in HPIV3 IB function but not IB formation. However, we are not sure whether PI4KB is recruited to IBs before or after fragmentation of the ER.\n\nIn conclusion, our work focused on describing the relationship between paramyxovirus IBs and the endomembrane, and we found that negative-strand viruses recruited PI4Ks to ROs. Research in these areas may offer fascinating insight into IBs of negative-strand RNA viruses and may also yield therapeutic strategies in negative-strand RNA virus-induced disease.\n\nDetailed methods are provided in the online version of this paper and include the following: for 30 min on ice.
