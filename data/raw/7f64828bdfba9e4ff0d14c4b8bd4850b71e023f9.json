{"title": "", "body": "Th e family Astroviridae comprises two genera, Mamastrovirus and Avastrovirus, which infect mammalian and avian species respectively. Astroviruses are spherical, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses typically 28-30 nm in diameter. In contrast to picornaviruses, which are similar in size but have no obvious surface structure, negative staining of astroviruses may reveal the presence of fi ve-or six-pointed star-shaped profi les, which occupy most of the presenting surface of about 10% of the virus particles ( Fig. 33.1 ). Astrovirus infection has been associated with outbreaks of diarrhoea in a variety of mammalian species, including humans, pigs, lambs, calves, dogs, cats, deer and mice; astroviruses appear to be host-restricted. At least eight serotypes of human astrovirus and two serotypes of bovine astrovirus have been \n\nrecognized. Astrovirus infection has been identifi ed as the cause of duck virus hepatitis (DVH) type II and of nephritis in chickens and has also been associated with enteric disease in turkey poults, including the so-called 'poult enteritis and mortality syndrome' (PEMS). Characterization studies have shown that there are at least two genetically distinct serotypes of turkey astrovirus.\n\nIt is likely that astrovirus infections occur in many species of domestic poultry. Th ere are reports of their occurrence in chickens in the UK and in guinea fowl with enteritis in Italy. As the starshaped profi les on the virions may not be present or may be diffi cult to recognize, it is possible that some of the small, round viruses described in the faeces of a number of diff erent avian species may be astroviruses. Amplifi cation and analysis of viral nucleic acid sequences is a much more reliable way of identifying putative astroviruses than negative-contrast electron microscopy.\n\nAstrovirus infection of turkeys has been described in the UK, Italy and the USA. It is likely that these infections occur worldwide. Infection in turkeys occurs very commonly in the fi rst 4 weeks of life. In a fl ock survey in the USA, astrovirus was detected in 79% of diseased fl ocks, as opposed to 29% of normal fl ocks. In the USA, mixed infections of astrovirus and group D Rotavirus occurred frequently in diseased fl ocks. More recently, astroviruses have been detected in the USA in association with PEMS (turkey astrovirus type 2) and have been shown to be antigenically and genetically distinct from previously described turkey astroviruses (Turkey astrovirus type 1). Th ere is no evidence for vertical transmission of astroviruses in turkeys or in other species. Spread probably occurs horizontally by ingestion of infected faecal material. Turkey astroviruses are extremely resistant to inactivation by a variety of physical and chemical agents. It has been reported that treatment with a peroxymonosulphate disinfectant, 0.3% formaldehyde or 90% methanol inactivates astrovirus in turkey embryo intestinal homogenates.\n\nIn the USA, astrovirus infection in commercial turkey poults has been associated with a syndrome, usually occurring between 1 and 3 weeks of age and characterized by diarrhoea, nervousness, litter eating, stunting and slightly increased mortality. Th e main economic impact of this syndrome stems from the stunting.\n\nTh e precise role of astrovirus in this syndrome is still to be defi ned. However, oral inoculation of specifi c-pathogen-free (SPF) poults with astrovirus resulted in the production of watery droppings and frothy, yellow-brown droppings from 3 to at least 13 days after inoculation. At necropsy, the caeca were distended with fl uid and gas. Th ere was gaseous fl uid in the intestinal tract, which also showed a loss of muscular tone. Th ere was no mortality but infected poults showed decreased weight gain and a decreased ability to absorb d-xylose compared with uninoculated controls. Dual infection of poults with astrovirus and group D Rotavirus produced a more severe experimental disease than astrovirus alone. Intestinal maltase activity was decreased in experimentally infected commercial poults from 3-7 days after inoculation.\n\nTurkey astrovirus type 2 has been associated with PEMS in the USA. Th is syndrome is characterized by enteritis, high mortality, growth depression, lymphoid atrophy and immunosuppression. Other viruses, including turkey enteric coronavirus, may be detected in poults with PEMS.\n\nTurkey astroviruses grow primarily in enterocytes located along the sides and near the base of villi throughout the small intestine, producing lesions of mild crypt hyperplasia. Villous atrophy has not been observed. With Turkey astrovirus type 2 there was minimal death of enterocytes and an absence of infl ammation. Th e mechanism by which diarrhoea is induced is unknown.\n\nTurkey astrovirus type 2 has been isolated from the thymus, bursa, spleen and plasma as well as from the intestinal tract of experimentally infected poults. Th e relative size of the thymuses of experimentally infected poults was decreased but there was no diff erence in the sizes of the bursa and spleen. Also, the functional properties of the macrophages and lymphocytes exposed to Turkey astrovirus type 2 in vivo and in vitro were impaired, so the virus may play a role in producing the immunosuppression associated with PEMS.\n\nAstroviruses can be detected in faeces by direct negative contrast or immunoelectron microscopy and until recently this was the only diagnostic method available. Turkey astroviruses have not yet been propagated in cell culture but there have been reports of isolation of the virus following inoculation and passage in 20-day-old SPF turkey embryos via the yolk-sac and in 22-25-day-old embryos inoculated by the amniotic route. More recently reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCRs) have been described that are able to detect and identify astrovirus in faeces and homogenates of intestinal and lymphoid tissues from infected poults. Th ese can distinguish between turkey astrovirus types 1 and 2. Antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) have also been reported. No serological tests are available yet.\n\nTh e general comments concerning control of Rotavirus infections (Ch. 32) apply equally to astrovirus infections. Because of the resistance of astroviruses to chemical and physical treatment, special emphasis needs to be placed on disinfection and good management practices in order to limit the spread of astrovirus infections between fl ocks of young turkeys. No vaccines are available.\n\nAn astrovirus has been identifi ed as the probable cause of DVH type II. Th is disease has been described only in East Anglia, England. It was widespread in 2-6-week-old ducks on fattening fi elds from 1963-1968. By 1969 the disease had disappeared but it reappeared in 1983-1984. Ducks are the only known hosts of the virus but as all outbreaks have initially involved fattening ducks kept in the open, it is possible that other wild birds act as vectors. Using cross-protection and challenge tests, the duck astrovirus was shown to be antigenically distinct from astroviruses isolated from chickens and turkeys and from the picornaviruses that cause DVH types I and III. Th e virus can be grown with diffi culty in chick and duck embryos following amniotic sac inoculation. After 6-10 days' incubation, infected embryos may be inert and stunted, with green necrotic livers. Examination of aff ected livers by negative-contrast electron microscopy reveals the presence of large numbers of astrovirus particles. Th e isolated virus has been grown in a chicken hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (LMH) following serial passage. Th e virus is excreted in the faeces and appears to spread horizontally by contact with infected ducklings or fomites.\n\nTh e clinical signs are similar to those of DVH type I (see Ch. 29). Losses of between 10% and 25% in 3-6-week-old ducks and up to 50% in 6-14-day-old ducks were reported. Diseased ducklings were the progeny of parents that had received DVH type I vaccine. Th e clinical signs and lesions are highly suggestive, particularly if they occur in the progeny of parents that have been vaccinated against DVH type I.\n\nTh e pathogenesis of astrovirus infection in ducks is unknown but the main target organs appear to be the liver and kidneys. As with DVH type I, adult ducks are refractory to disease.\n\nLaboratory diagnosis is based upon direct electron microscopic examination of livers from dead ducks. Virus isolation can be attempted in chick or duck embryos. Serological diagnosis is not recommended because very low levels of antibody are often detected in convalescent sera.\n\nAn experimental live attenuated vaccine propagated in chicken embryos has been used successfully. Th is is administered by subcutaneous inoculation before the young ducks go out onto the fi elds. Inoculation of susceptible ducklings with convalescent serum has been used successfully on aff ected farms. Reducing contact with wild birds by rearing ducks indoors will reduce the incidence of the disease.\n\nA virus designated Avian nephritis virus (ANV) was fi rst described in Japan in 1979. It was isolated from the rectal contents of an apparently normal 1-week-old broiler chick. ANV was provisionally identifi ed as an enterovirus on the grounds of morphology (30 nm small, round virus particles), RNA content, cytoplasmic replication, resistance to lipid solvents and acid, and partial stabilization to heat inactivation by magnesium chloride. However, following the complete sequencing of the viral genome ANV has been identifi ed as an astrovirus. ANV is antigenically unrelated to DVH type II. At least two serotypes of ANV have been identifi ed, designated ANV 1 and ANV 2.\n\nAvailable evidence suggests that ANV is distributed worldwide in domestic fowl. Antibody to ANV has also been detected in fl ocks of SPF chickens. Antibody has also been detected in turkeys by indirect immunofl uorescence but not by serum neutralization. As turkeys resist experimental infection with ANV, this suggests that turkeys are infected with a virus antigenically related to but distinct from ANV. It was not detected in 111 fertile eggs laid by SPF hens experimentally infected with the virus, indicating that, if it occurs at all, vertical transmission occurs at a very low frequency. ANV spreads readily to in-contact chickens, probably through ingestion of faecally contaminated material.\n\nTh e importance of ANV as an avian pathogen is not fully established. Following oral inoculation of 1-day-old SPF chickens with the G-4260 strain of ANV, diarrhoea was observed from 3-7 days after infection. Also, inoculated chicks showed 33% mortality and had signifi cantly lower body weights 14 days after inoculation than uninoculated controls. Visceral urate deposition was observed in the dead chicks. Histologically, the kidneys of birds examined 14 days after infection showed interstitial nephritis of varying severity. Other isolates of ANV diff ered from the G-4260 strain in various aspects of their pathogenicity in the same disease model.\n\nWhile chickens of any age can be infected with ANV, 1-day-old chicks are the most susceptible; there is a developing age resistance to disease.\n\nSince the original isolation, viruses with similar morphology and physical characteristics and antigenically indistinguishable from ANV have been isolated in Japan and Europe. Th ese include viruses associated with the runting stunting syndrome in Belgium and the UK. Th ese produce depressions in weight gain of variable severity in orally infected broilers. Histopathological lesions in the small intestine include villous stunting and increased crypt depth.\n\nTo isolate ANV, samples of faeces and/or kidney should be inoculated into cultures of chick kidney cells grown in serum-free medium or into chick embryos via the yolk sac or chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) routes. Some isolates of ANV produce a typical enterovirus rounded cell cytopathic eff ect. However, growth in cell cultures is more reliably detected by immunofl uorescence. Infected chick embryos die, but signs of ANV infection are not pathognomonic. Immunofl uorescent staining of yolk stalk or CAM preparations is required to demonstrate that ANV is present.\n\nAntibodies to ANV have been detected by indirect immunofl uorescence, serum neutralization tests and ELISA. Of these, serum neutralization is the most sensitive, but is costly and laborious.\n\nUntil the role of ANV is better defi ned, no control measures are recommended. ANV should, however, be eliminated from SPF fl ocks.\n\nIn recent years, isolations of three chicken astroviruses antigenically related to each other and antigenically and genetically distinct from ANV1 and DVH type 2 astrovirus have been described. Th ese viruses have been designated chicken astrovirus. Th ey were isolated in chick embryo liver cell cultures and also grew well in the LMH cell line. Th ey caused mild diarrhoea and some distension in the small intestines of experimentally infected 1-day-old SPF chicks. Antibody to chicken astrovirus was widespread in broilers and broiler breeders and was also present in some turkey fl ocks. Th eir ability to cause disease in the fi eld has not yet been investigated but the virus was isolated from chicks with runting stunting syndrome or enteric problems. Th e amino acid sequence derived from the relatively conserved nonstructural polyprotein of chicken astrovirus showed 55% identity with that of ANV1 and 58% identity with that of turkey astrovirus type 2. Th e antigenic relationship of chicken astrovirus to ANV2 remains to be investigated."}
