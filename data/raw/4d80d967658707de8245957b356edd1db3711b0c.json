{"title": "", "body": "The recognition that infection of rodents with many of the murine viruses and mycoplasmas as well as other classes of organisms interferes with research is not a recent discovery (1).\n\nIn fact, this conference is at least the third since 1961 devoted to spontaneous infectious diseases of laboratory animals (2,3).\n\nAs we have heard and seen during this meeting, much new information has been developed for at least some of the murine viruses and mycoplasmas and a greater understanding of the biology of these agents has been gained.\n\nUnfortunately, many animal facilities have been slow to profit from this newer knowledge. I appreciate this opportunity and challenge to explore ways of applying our newer knowledge to the problems of detecting, controlling, and preventing viral and mycoplasmal disease.\n\nThe institution, as represented by its investigators and staff, must collectively decide on its commitment to a defined level of quality of animals used and animal care provided.\n\nThis commitment should be translated into institutional policies and standard operating procedures concerning the purchase, care, and use of animals. This commitment should extend to supporting a well trained and qualified animal care staff.\n\nIn developing position descriptions for animal care personnel, recognition of advanced training in laboratory animal science and certification by examining bodies is useful.\n\nAfter people are hired, continued professional development through both intramural and extramural training programs is of benefit to both the institution and the employee.\n\nTraining and continuing education should be made available to both technician level and professional staff.\n\nProviding animal care is but one way for an animal facility staff to serve an institution.\n\nInstruction of investigators and their technicians in animal handling and surgical techniques are common practices. In many academic institutions members of the animal facility staff teach courses covering the humane care and use of animals in research.\n\nWhere qualified, professional level staff may teach in other academic disciplines. An important function of the animal facility staff in many institutions is research, especially on subjects related directly to the health and care of the animals used in research. This may range from basic research to applied research which may answer a problem peculiar to that institution. Only when an institution's leaders encourage and support all of these functions do they stand to realize the most from their investment in the animal facility and the staff.\n\nInstitutions vary considerably in their animal facility and care requirements. Large academic institutions, especially those with a health sciences component, require the widest range of services and facilities when the variety of species used, diversity of research, and turnover of investigators are considered.\n\nIn contrast, well designed facilities devoted to animal production usually make fewer changes once established. Between these extremes are corporate research facilities, contract research organizations, and governmental research laboratories which may approach large academic institutions in the variety of their requirements.\n\nBecause of these widely different requirements, only general guidelines and principles can be given\n\nconcerning the organizational structure and the operation of animal facilities as they apply to the detection, prevention and control of disease.\n\nManagement of all animal care facilities in an institution are best centralized whether or not the physical facilities are centralized.\n\nWith all animal care information flowing through one office, there is less opportunity for failures of communication. Detection, control, and prevention of disease are enhanced by centralized management. Additional benefits are more efficient utilization of labor and equipment and greater economy in ordering animals and supplies.\n\nInvestigators must work with and support the staff if a goal of disease free rodents is to be achieved and maintained.\n\nEven if a totally disease free facility is not achieved, cooperation and application of isolation techniques can assist in the successful elimination of many undesirable pathogens and the completion of most research. Further, assessing how an institution might attain disease free status can be both beneficial and enlightening to the managers, investigators and administrators alike.\n\nA comprehensive environmental monitoring program should be part of every facility's management plan. Attention must be given to the potential effects on the animals and the staff of any cleaning agents or pesticides used. Environmental monitoring in animal facilities was recently reviewed (4).\n\nThe quality of the animals, feed, and bedding purchased and the health of the animals in the facility needs to be monitored.\n\nMonitoring programs are frequently referred to as quality assurance programs, or QA programs for short. The scope and structure of the programs will be dictated in part by the population of the animals, nature of the research, sources of animals, impact of losses due to contaminated animals, feed, and bedding, and the degree to which the institution and its investigators are willing to support such a program. From the outset it must be realized that QA programs are not by themselves disease prevention programs.\n\nA QA program characterizes in a defined manner only those animals or products tested. Only if the animals are held in quarantine until the test results are evaluated and infection carrying animals destroyed to prevent entry of pathogens into the animal facility does the QA program prevent entry of disease. QA programs for breeding colonies, especially commercial colonies or institutional colonies furnishing animals to other laboratories take on added significance as infected animals are the usual source of new infections in a colony.\n\nMathematical considerations for sampling populations of laboratory rodents, especially for the detection of antibody to the murine viruses, have been discussed several times in recent years and will not be discussed here (5,6,7, 8, 9) . However, a population of experimental animals or a breeding colony is a community of living organisms complete with its group dynamics just as is a community of people, not a static entity.\n\nIn the design of animal holding space, quarantine facilities or space for the diagnostic laboratory to hold rodents under observation is frequently overlooked or the space is poorly placed. Ideally, it should be remote from holding space for animals on experiment or from breeding colonies, but close to the diagnostic laboratory. Unnecessary traffic through the diagnostic laboratory should be discouraged.\n\nAn autoclave should be present for the sterilization of used cages, bedding, etc.\n\nThe cost of a diagnostic laboratory and QA program should be considered a necessary aspect of the research program, keeping in mind the total investment in research utilizing animals. Fee for service charges to investigators for disease investigation are counter productive. Human nature being what it is, this approach usually results in fewer sick and dead animals being reported.\n\nEither as direct support from the institution, or recovery of costs via per diem charges is a more productive approach. The Director of the animal facility needs to have the ability to initiate the investigation of any suspected disease problem without arguing over a few dollars for the necessary tests.\n\nPrevious speakers have addressed current laboratory diagnostic procedures for the specific murine viral and mycoplasmal agents.\n\nInstead, I want to cover disease detection from the perspective of the colony or facility manager and the clinician.\n\nThe role of those who provide daily care for the animals should not be overlooked in disease detection. Frequently, it is the animal technician/ caretaker, in daily contact with the animals, who first alerts the professional staff to a problem. Often they observe minor changes in appearance or behavoir, notice a change in reproductive performance or a slight weight loss before laboratory tests indicate a problem. Sendai virus infections in rats and in many strains of mice usually are\n\nsubclinical. The clinician has only to interpret the animal care staff's observations and request the appropriate tests.\n\nThe animal care staff should be encouraged to report their observations and the professional staff should provide training in the recognition of signs of disease. Good communications between the professional staff and the animal care staff may be the clinician's most effective means of early disease detection. The same situation applies to the clinician's relationship with investigators and their technicians.\n\nBecause these people often have frequent contact with their animals or are using cells or tissues from the animals for various assays, their observations and experimental data may provide the first indication of a problem.\n\nOur institute has experienced this on more than one occasion when mouse hepatitis virus entered a colony of mice used to assay peritoneal macrophage functions. The first indication of a problem was increased macrophage activity in the control animals. No overt illness or deaths were observed (10) . Figure 1 depicts a suggested table of organization for an animal health quality assurance program. Environmental quality of the animal facility and proper operation of equipment are important factors in maintaining animal health (4). The extent of characterization, frequency of testing, Figure 1. Sources of information and specimens for an animal health quality assurance program. From (12) . and what portion of the testing will be done within the institution's own laboratories or through outside service groups must be decided.\n\nThe importance of testing tumors and tissue cultures for murine pathogens must be emphasized. The qualifications and/or availability of inhouse staff and laboratories will be deciding factors. Even small facilities with a trained staff can have a thorough QA program if samples and tests are carefully selected. Examination for parasites, many bacteria, and examination for gross lesions can be done relatively inexpensively. Serological tests for viruses and mycoplasma can be done with commercial kits or using fluorescent antibody techniques. Alternatively, s\u00e9rologie tests can be contracted for with outside laboratories as can histopathologic and other services. More important than how a QA Program/ Diagnostic Service is set up is that it be flexible to respond to changing needs and new information.\n\nGood laboratory practices, including quality control of tests performed, should be followed. Further, the people responsible must be competent and able to correctly interpret the results obtained.\n\nAccurate records of morbidity and mortality in an animal facility combined with examination of dead or ill animals by a person experienced in rodent diseases are helpful in identifying problems at an early stage. In experimental animals it is sometimes difficult for the animal care staff to know if signs of morbidity and/or mortality result from experimental procedures or from other causes. Investigators should be encouraged to discuss anticipated reactions to experimental treatments.\n\nAlso, as suggested earlier, the submission of dead and sick animals for further examination should be emphasized. My own impression is that I have seen more disease problems initially diagnosed by a combination of a complete history, thorough clinical examination, and the findings at necropsy than by any other means.\n\nBased on the necropsy findings plus other information, a decision can be made as to whether other tests should be performed.\n\nIn addition, further investigation may require examining more animals from the same cage, room, or shipment.\n\nAnimals need not always be killed as they may be examined in the animal room and blood and fecal samples can be collected.\n\nWhile this conference is centering its attention on viruses and mycoplasma, they are but two classes of organisms to be considered when investigating disease.\n\nA differential diagnosis must consider all possibilities, including environmental factors and management practices.\n\nCertainly, before colonies are destroyed due to the diagnosis of disease, the diagnosis should be confirmed by additional objective means.\n\nand scheduling of animals for routine monitoring is important. Rather than use animals belonging to investigators or breeding programs, it is recommended that animals be specifically maintained in each room as sentinels.\n\nThey belong to the QA program and, if the need arises, can be examined at any time in addition to the regular schedule.\n\nThe NIEHS presently maintains isolator colonies of pathogen free mice and rats for the purpose of supplying sentinel animals. Depending upon the species in the room, 16 mice or 12 rats are placed in four unfiltered cages and distributed about the room. One animal is removed from each cage at three-month intervals. These animals are examined for titers to murine viruses, cultured for mycoplasma, examined for ecto-and endoparasites, and for gross lesions.\n\nComposite fecal samples are cultured for enteric pathogens.\n\nSentinels are maintained as groups until evidence of an undesirable organism is confirmed, at which time the remaining animals are replaced.\n\nSchemes for monitoring colonies have recently been described elsewhere and will not be reviewed further here (6,7, 11, 12) .\n\nSampling and testing of rodents received from commercial or other outside sources present problems. Rarely can each shipment be checked thoroughly before use. Therefore, confidence in and reliability of the supplier plays a critical role.\n\nData obtained from random samples are frequently used to make judgements concerning the vendor's entire facility. This may not be a correct judgement as some breeders have several areas supplying the same strain or stock. Health data from a specific area may indicate absence of certain pathogens; however, if enroute to the customer they come in contact with infected animals i.e., in the stock room or shipping room or during transport, they can become infected and introduce infection into the recipient's colony. This situation is illustrated in TABLE I. In an attempt to identify the source of rat coronavirus entering NIEHS colonies, shipments of rats were received from different vendors and on arrival blood samples were collected.\n\nThe rats were individually identified, housed in negative pressure Horsfall-Bauer units and rebled after 28 days and 48-55 days.\n\nNormally, animals are bled only on arrival and after 28 days; however, they are kept until the results are received and evaluated. The 28 day samples are tested first and others are tested only if these are positive. These rats were held approximately 50 days for other purposes. Test results represent ELISA values and the one positive value in the F344/N group from Supplier A is considered to be a false positive as the same rat subsequently \n\nWhile it may seem trite to remind this audience of the germ theory and the philosophical corollary, cause and effect, this point is frequently made light of or not appreciated in developing strategies for the maintenance of disease free colonies.\n\nPrevention of infectious diseases among laboratory rodents is primarily a function of sound\n\nManagement practices should be aimed at excluding undesirable organisms from the facilities. Where it is not feasible to totally exclude pathogens from all areas of the animal facilities, separation of disease free from infected or potentially infected animals should be rigorously adhered to. Exclusion of undesirable organisms is based on a monitoring program which microbiologically characterizes animals from new sources and established sources as well as animals already in the animal facility. Access to animal facilities should be limited to those who have a need to be there.\n\nInfectious agents may spread among the animals in a cage without spreading to other cages. Depending on the organism, it may be eliminated with the development of antibody in the infected animals, i.e., sendai virus and rat coronavirus, or it may spread to animals in other cages until most if not all susceptible animals become infected. Depending on the agent and the animal 1 s genotype, mortality may be high or low, or not occur at all. If additional susceptible animals are continually added to the population, either via breeding or as new arrivals, the infection may go on indefinitely. Spread among animals will be determined in part by cage design and husbandry practices as well as the organism.\n\nThe use of filter caps on mouse cages to prevent the spread of epizootic diarrhea of infant mice (EDIM) is a well recognized example of a husbandry practice which can alter the course of an epizootic (13) . Subsequently, cage filters of various designs have been used on rodent cages to reduce the chance of aerosol spread of infection. Undirectional flow of air at the cage or room level has been useful (14, 15, 16) ; however, it is not a panacea (17) . Other factors which play a role in the introduction and spread of infection are: mode of spread, strain(s) of animals, characteristics and strain(s) of the infectious agent, and presence or absence of immune animals.\n\nThe ability to quarantine incoming animals and animal tissues is essential to preventing the introduction of unwanted pathogens.\n\nFrequently only animals received from sources of unknown disease status are quarantined. This usually suffices as the volume of animals received from previously characterized commercial sources would be too great and in some cases, the animals would be of no value after a quarantine period, i.e., date bred animals and those ordered at specific weights.\n\nQuarantine programs may be considered as passive or active, depending on what is done during the quarantine period.\n\nA passive quarantine is characterized by isolation from other animals for a period of time, usually seven to 28 days with observation for signs of disease or mortality. This form of quarantine will not reveal many infectious agents which rodents may carry and is considered inadequate.\n\nIn contrast, an active quarantine program examines animals and tissues for the presence of undesirable organisms while they are in isolation. Such a program has been described (6, 18, 19) .\n\nSeveral different types of caging equipment can be used to isolate rodents.\n\nFlexible film or solid wall isolators of the type usually used for housing gnotobiotic animals (20), Horsfall-Bauer type cages (12) , individually filtered cages (21), isolation (Illinois) cubicles (15) Properly selected and correctly used, several small groups of rodents can be quarantined in a small space with little danger of cross contamination.\n\nAll animals and tissues with unknown microbiological status are considered contaminated and are isolated from other animals in the facility.\n\nNewly arrived animals or animals inoculated with suspect tissues are held in filtered cages, plastic isolators, Illinois cubicles, or Horsfall-Bauer type units.\n\nBlood is collected and screened for antibody to the murine viruses appropriate for the species (12) .\n\nIn addition, animals are thoroughly examined for ecto-and endoparasites, pathogenic bacteria, and mycoplasma.\n\nTissue cultures and tumors are examined for contamination with adventitious viruses and other infectious agents.\n\nAdditional aspects of a quarantine program including use of cohabitants, suppression, and animal inoculations have been recently reviewed (12) . It is helpful if arrangements can be made to allow investigators to work with animals during quarantine if necessary.\n\nAs indicated above, animal health and quality assurance programs must consider as suspect animals from uncharacterized sources.\n\nNo amount of intramural effort will control disease and result in disease free animal colonies if infected animals are being added from extramural sources.\n\nOnce established as specific pathogen free (SPF) (sensu strictu), animal colonies must be frequently monitored to assure the continued absence of the specified pathogens.\n\nManagement practices must be directed towards maintaining the animals free of pathogens.\n\nNot all animal health problems are associated with microorganisms.\n\nWhen disease is first suspected it is important to confirm its presence and to establish a correct diagnosis.\n\nThe sensitivity and specificity of the test procedure and the experience of the person performing the test must be considered. A single positive s\u00e9rologie test should not be considered adequate evidence for deciding to destroy a colony. If the same serum sample is available, it can be tested using another method, i.e., check a suspect ELISA or HI result with the FA technique.\n\nAlso, the original test procedure may be repeated. Depending on the number of animals previously tested, additional animals from the same source may be examined. If interpretation of test results obtained through a commercial laboratory is difficult or the results questionable, consultation with the laboratory staff is advisable. A complete history should be obtained and the animals carefully examined for signs of disease.\n\nHowever, many murine pathogens can be present without clinical evidence of infection. Once a disease has been identified, it is important to establish its source and how it gained entrance. Otherwise, the efforts and expense to eliminate the current episode will be largely wasted.\n\nThe control of the spread among or the elimination of murine viral and mycoplasmal diseases from laboratory animal populations presents a number of problems. A paucity of information concerning the biology, pathogenesis and epizootiology of some of the causative agents hinders the development of an informed strategy for dealing with many of the diseases. Important aspects of the causative organism include: duration of persistence in the host and in the environment, duration of shedding, rate and mode of spread, characteristics of different strains, development of and persistence of antibody, and resistance to disinfectants and environmental factors.\n\nWith most murine pathogens all of the above questions have not been definitely answered. In some instances data obtained from related viruses affecting other species have been applied to murine diseases. To a limited degree, available information has been summarized in TABLES II and III. When developing strategies for dealing with infections of rodents, the nature of the affected animals, i.e., species, strain, stock, as well as the intended use of the animals must be considered. A breeding colony distributing animals to other institutions and infected with a persistent virus or mycoplasma presents a different problem from the same agent found in an isolated b) Natural infection in laboratory mice with Reovirus types 1 and 2 has not been reported. Serological tests such as IFA and ELISA do not distinguish between antibodies to reovirus serotypes.\n\n14) Rotavirus a) IDIR virus reported in rats has also been isolated from humans. Natural epizootiology is unknown.\n\ngroup of experimental animals 18 months into a two year study\u00b7 Destruction of a breeding colony infected with a persistent agent is easier to defend if the colony can be rapidly replaced.\n\nHowever, if new disease free breeding stock is not available, either from existing colonies or via surgical derivation, the impact of the infectious agent for the intended use of the animals produced must be weighed. In the case of the animals on a two year study, all interests may be served by maintaining them isolated from susceptible animals.\n\nAttempts to control or eliminate infections in populations of rodents require a coordinated effort with communication between those responsible for the control program, support staff, and the users of the animal facility.\n\nThe nature and extent of the problem, the options available, and the tentative plan to be implemented need to be discussed with all involved.\n\nMaintaining colonies of disease free rodents in close association with infected colonies is difficult.\n\nOver time, the disease profile of the colony with the greatest number of pathogens frequently becomes the norm for the institution. If a zoonotic disease is present, e.g., lymphocytic choriomeningitis or Hantaan virus, involvement of those responsible for human health programs is recommended.\n\nEven where danger of human infection is not present, consultation with experts is desirable if the necessary experience is not available on the institute's staff.\n\nThe options for controlling or eliminating murine viruses and mycoplasmas can usually be discussed under the following headings:\n\n1. Do nothing.\n\nIf done with an understanding of what is likely to occur, this can be a perfectly acceptable course of action with several viral infections.\n\nIn a cohort of rats, the introduction of rat coronavirus will usually cause only a mild respiratory disease for a few days and then disappear.\n\nIf new (naive) rats are not added during the acute phase of the infection, the disease will not continue (19) .\n\n2. Test and slaughter. This approach may be effective early in an outbreak where groups of susceptible animals can be isolated from each other, infected animals can be easily, accurately, and rapidly identified, and the number of infected animals or areas is small. However, monitoring must be extensive to assure total elimination, e.g., mycoplasmosis (24), mouse pox (25).\n\nInfected animals or those suspected of being infected are isolated and tested for the presence of pathogens or held until the pathogen is no longer present.\n\nUseful when it is desired to add naive stock to an area with an enzootic infection. At the present time vaccine is available only against sendai virus (26) and ectromelia virus (18, 27, 28) . (The latter vaccine is the IHD-T strain of vaccinia virus).\n\nVaccination against infection with ectromelia virus (mouse pox) is controversial as disease may be suppressed but not eliminated. Further, vaccinations must be \"read\" and results recorded as vaccination failures are indicative of infection with ectromelia.\n\n5. Elimination of infected animals. This can be at the cage, room, or colony level. Following decontamination and clean up the area is restocked with disease free animals.\n\nOnce the presence of a new disease has been confirmed, elimination of the colony or experimental group without testing individual animals is a common course of action. Regardless of the infectious agent involved, it is worthwhile to take advantage of the absence of animals and thoroughly sanitize the rooms and equipment. The disinfectant should be matched to the infectious agent. Many viruses are reported to resist one or more classes of disinfectants in concentrations and for exposure times expected to be used in animal facilities (29,30,31,32,33). Scott (29) examined the activity of several disinfectants and their combination against three feline viruses (a herpesvirus, a calicivirus, and a parvovirus) and Brown (30) examined the activity of disinfectants against three porcine viruses (a herpesvirus, a parvovirus, and a coronavirus). The parvovirus in both cases was the most resistant while the herpesviruses and the coronavirus were quite susceptible to a broad range of disinfectants. The calicivirus (Picornaviridae) was intermediate in its resistance. The single most effective agent tested was household bleach (sodium hypochlorite 5-6 percent) diluted 1:32 and used alone or in combination with a quaternary ammonium disinfectant for added detergency. Major drawbacks to the use of sodium hypochlorite solutions are its corrosive and potentially toxic nature and its inactivation by organic matter.\n\nIn most rodent facilities the organic load is not excessive and if adequate ventilation is provided, the diluted solutions can be safely used, especially if the total volume is not excessive\u00b7\n\nThe wide spectrum of disinfectant activity achieved with chlorine without many of its disadvantages has been reported using the relatively new disinfectant, chlorine dioxide, in combination with an organic acid (34,35) .\n\nThe practice of fumigating animal rooms with formaldehyde gas, with few exceptions, probably represents an unnecessary exercise for the intended purpose.\n\nIn most cases, the hazards to people and animals associated with the use of formaldehyde gas in animal facilities are unwarranted and outweigh the benefits. Thorough cleaning of an animal facility with a chlorine or iodophor based disinfectant will usually be possible and will generally suffice (18) .\n\nHowever, formaldehyde gas remains a logical choice when contaminated surfaces are not exposed and/or delicate instruments are present.\n\nimprovement in the quality of laboratory rodents depends, in part, on new knowledge concerning the infectious agents afflicting these animals.\n\nEspecially needed is information about the survival of these agents in the host and in the environment. The persistent state in its several forms has been defined and discussed in depth elsewhere (36, 37) . Suffice it to say, with the multitude of mouse and rat strains, many of which are immunologie cripples, the variations in persistency seem endless. Added to the variations in the host's response are differences among strains of pathogens, e.g., MHV (38) and LCM (39). The source of viral and mycoplasmal pathogens in previously disease free rodent colonies cannot always be identified, even after extensive epizootiologic investigation.\n\nThe question of pathogen persistence and the form it takes often remains a mystery.\n\nWhile humans are rarely considered the source of the pathogen for outbreaks of disease in rodent colonies, their role in epizootics, especially with outbreaks where the source cannot be identified, must be considered.\n\nThe distinction between mechanical carriers of pathogens (fomites) and biological carriers where the pathogen resides in the carrier, possibly replicating, and is shed must be made.\n\nThe preponderance of evidence mitigates against humans as biological carriers of the common murine viruses and mycoplasmas; however, the problem of sorting out the differences among the Paramyxoviridae, including Sendai (26) and the Reoviridae (40) remain.\n\nWhen we convene again to discuss still newer information on the subject of viral and mycoplasmal pathogens of rodents, we can only hope that many of the missing pieces of the puzzle will have been found. Unlike picture puzzles, the quest for pieces to the biological puzzle usually gives rise to new and even more interesting puzzles."}
