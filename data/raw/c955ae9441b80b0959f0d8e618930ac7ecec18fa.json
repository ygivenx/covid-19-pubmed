{"title": "Viroporins and inflammasomes: a key to understand virus-induced inflammation", "body": "Inflammasomes are large multimolecular complexes best recognized for their ability to control activation of caspase-1, which in turn regulates the maturation of interleukin-1 \u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and interleukin 18 . IL-1\u03b2 was originally identified as a pro-inflammatory cytokine able to induce both local and systemic inflammation and a febrile reaction in response to infection or injury. Excessive production of IL-1\u03b2 is associated with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Microbial derivatives, bacterial pore-forming toxins, extracellular ATP and other pathogen-associated molecular patterns trigger activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes. Recent studies have reported that viroporin activity is capable of inducing inflammasome activity and production of IL-1\u03b2, where NLRP3 is shown to be regulated by fluxes of K + , H + and Ca 2+ in addition to reactive oxygen species, autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress. The aim of this review is to present an overview of the key findings on viroporin activity with special emphasis on their role in virus immunity and as possible activators of inflammasomes. \n\nInterferon c\n\nInterleukin 18\n\nInterleukin-1 beta receptor\n\nInterleukin 1 receptor antagonist\n\nInterleukin-1 beta\n\nIce protease-activating factor, also known as NLRC4\n\nInterferon regulatory transcription factor\n\nLGP2 laboratory of genetics and physiology 2\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome TGN Trans-golgi network \n\nThe immune response to different pathological invasions in the human body is mediated by two arms; innate and acquired immunity. Innate immunity is the first arm of immune response to viral infections. The antiviral response is triggered upon the sensing of the different viral antigens by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the infected cell [1] .\n\nSuch response is crucial as it acts to suppress viral replication and spread to other cells. It is also required for programming functional adaptive immune responses and, therefore, coordinates the entire host immune response to infection [1] . The innate immune response to viruses is composed of three main classes of PRRs, termed the RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I)-like receptors (RLRs), the toll-like receptors (TLRs), and the Nod (nucleotide oligomerization domain)-like receptors (NLRs) [2] . These receptors sense specific molecules within the virus termed PAMPs (Pathogen associated molecular patterns) and then signal through various downstream messengers to activate transcription factors that drive the expression of antiviral genes and various cytokines, such as type I and III interferons and IL-1\u03b2 [3] . Production of these cytokines is essential for activation of the whole immune response against the viral infection. T ype I interferons induce expression of co-stimulatory molecules such as CD80, CD86 and CD40 leading to maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) as well as antigen presentation on MHC class I and cross presentation of viral antigens [4] . These cytokines are also responsible for recruitment of monocytes and other lymphocytes to the site of infection, and they upregulate effector molecules in charge of protein synthesis, cell growth and survival and activation of anti-viral mode [5] .\n\nJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f This includes stimulation with TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, and TLR9 ligands, but not the TLR2 ligand [9] .\n\nIn case of the hepatitis C virus, TLRs such as TLR2 and TLR4 can be induced by the virus [6, 10] and intracellular TLRs such as TLR3 and TLR7 can sense virus RNA [11, 12] . Activation of TLR3 inhibits HCV replication, suggesting that TLR3 is part of the antiviral response to the infection [13, 14] . TLR3 signals are transduced through TIR domain containing adapter-inducing IFN-\u03b2 (TRIF) leading to activation of the transcription factors IRF3 and NF\u03baB for induction of innate immunity [15, 16] . On the other hand, recognition of the hepatitis C virus by TLR7 in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells leads to production of IFN, or activation of inflammasome pathway [17] .\n\nThe RLR (RIG-I like receptors) family includes different receptors such as MDA5\n\n(melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5), LGP2 (Laboratory of Genetics and\n\nPhysiology 2) and RIG-I which is the best described sensor protein for viral infections [18] . RIG-I is a cytosolic dsRNA helicase that is encoded in humans by the DDX58 gene.\n\nIt consists of two N-terminal CARDs (caspase activation and recruitment domains) followed by a central DExD/H box helicase and C-terminal regulatory domains (helicase-CTD) [19, 20] . Viral dsRNA is sensed by RIG-I via its helicase domain whereas the CARD domains are responsible for downstream signaling [18] . Upon binding of PAMPs to RIG-I, conformational changes are induced where the C-terminal repression is relieved, followed by binding to the viral RNA and scanning for particular U/UC sequences [21] . Then RIG-I releases CARD domains for ubiquitination by TRIM25 and interaction with 14-3-3\u03b5 (a family of regulatory molecules that interact with several J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f signaling proteins) to promote association with intracellular membranes for translocation to the mitochondrial-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane (mitochondrialassociated membrane, MAM) to recruit a mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), termed RIG-I signaling adaptor protein [20, 21] . This interaction will in turn activate effector molecules, including the transcription factors IRF3 and NF\u03baB, to drive downstream innate immune signaling [18, 20] .\n\nThe most recently identified pathway in the recognition of RNA viruses is governed by Nod (nucleotide oligomerization domain)-like receptors (NLRs) that recognize PAMPs, as well as host-derived danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) [22] and cause subsequent activation of inflammasomes [23] . Unlike TLRs, this family consists of soluble proteins that survey the cytoplasm for signals that advertise the presence of intracellular invaders [24] . Structurally, NLRs are multidomain proteins with a tripartite architecture containing a C-terminal region characterized by a series of leucine-rich repeats [25] , a central nucleotide domain termed the NACHT domain (also referred to as NOD domain) [26] , and an N-terminal caspase recruitment (CARD) or pyrin (PYD)\n\ndomain [27] . LRRs are believed to function in ligand sensing and autoregulation, whereas CARD and PYD domains mediate homotypic protein-protein interactions for downstream signaling. NLR subfamilies differ in their N-terminal effector domains, which mediate signal transduction to downstream targets, leading to activation of inflammatory caspases by inflammasomes or NF-\u03baB by NOD signalosomes [27] . The J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f NACHT domain, which is the only domain common to all NLR family members, enables activation of the signaling complex via ATP-dependent oligomerization [26] .\n\nSince the M2 protein of influenza virus A was described to have ion channel activity in 1992 [28] , several ion channel proteins encoded by viruses have been discovered. This new family of virus proteins that alter membrane permeability was named viroporins.\n\nTypically, viroporins are comprised of 50-120 amino acids and tend to form homooligomers [29, 30] . Oligomerization produces a hydrophilic pore which allows ion transport across host cell membranes. Activity of these viral ion channel proteins is involved in many stages of the virus infection cycle. Viroporins play important roles in virus genome replication and assembly, as well as virus particle entry and release from infected cells [31] . Some studies reported that the deletion of viroporin-encoding genes from virus genome significantly reduces the formation of virus progeny, and thus lowers virus pathogenicity. This highlights the essential role of viroporins in the viral life cycle, opening a new window for their potential use as antiviral targets [32] [33] [34] .\n\nThe study of viroporins initially focused on M2 of the influenza A virus (IAV), picornavirus protein 2B (P2B) and togavirus protein 6K, while only recently HIV-1 viral protein U (Vpu) and HCV p7 were included [32] . A summary of viroporins and their roles in viral life cycle is provided in Table 1 Along the study of the nature of viroporins, the question has been raised of whether ion gated channels or small sized pores are formed and whether ions are redistributed according to their concentration gradient [38, 39] . Studies of transgenically expressed viroporins in cell cultures, planar lipid bilayer or liposomes have shown that each viroporin has its individual channel function, which determines how it would affect membrane permeability [32] . For instance, the most characterized viroporin M2 was studied by patch-clamp recordings and proton conductance was demonstrated [40] . The channel was shown to conduct protons selectively across cellular membranes which causes loss of organelle acidification [41] . The same activity was confirmed by biochemical assays such as haemagglutinin protein translocation to the cell surface.\n\nwhich is a direct consequence of exposure to increasing pH in vesicles by M2 activity [42] [43] [44] . Similarly, Vpu of HIV-1 was shown to be a voltage-gated proton selective channel in electrophysiological studies [45, 46] . A cation selective behavior has been J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f reported for HCV p7 [47, 48] , togavirus 6K and the notorious coronavirus envelope small membrane protein (E); causative agent of SARS, MERS and the current outbreak COVID-19 [49] . HCV p7 was shown to be a pH-gated proton channel with genotypedependent specific sensitivity to channel blocking drugs [50] . Another reported activity of viroporins is the alteration of intracellular calcium homeostasis where entry of extracellular calcium and/or Ca 2+ leakage from intracellular stores, such as the mitochondria, ER and Golgi complex has been observed [51] . Certain viroporins, such as P2B, polyprotein P2BC and P3A from poliovirus [52] or envelope small membrane protein (E) from coronavirus induce intracellular membrane remodeling to generate new membrane vesicles (called the viroplasm) that serve as viral replication sites [49, 53] .\n\nSeveral studies have claimed the involvement of viroporins in virus induced programmed cell death such as the case with coronavirus E protein and picornavirus 2B viroporin [54] .\n\nThis was attributed to perturbation of ion homeostasis, a common hallmark of apoptosis, which causes depolarization of the plasma membrane associated with intracellular cations overload and cell volume decreases as a result of anions and H2O efflux [55, 56] .\n\nAlthough the biochemistry and diversity of inflammasomes are still poorly understood, four inflammasomes have been identified and defined by their NLR protein;\n\nthe NLRP1/NALP1b inflammasomes, the NLRC4/IPAF inflammasome, the NLRP3/NALP3 inflammasome and the AIM2 (absent in melanoma) containing inflammasome [57] . A summary of the four prototypes of inflammasomes is provided in Table 2 .\n\nInflammasomes are molecular platforms activated upon cellular infection or stress that trigger the maturation of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 to engage innate immune defenses [58] . They are multi-protein complexes made up of a sensor protein, the adaptor protein ASC, and the cellular protease caspase-1 [22] . Caspases are cysteine proteases that initiate or execute cellular programs, leading to inflammation or cell death.\n\nInflammasomes activate a class of caspases known as inflammatory caspases [59] .\n\nInflammatory caspases in mammals have a CARD domain followed by a domain containing the catalytic residue cysteine [60, 61] . Caspase-1 itself is synthesized as an inactive 45 kDa zymogen (pro-caspase-1) that undergoes autocatalytic processing following an appropriate stimulus [60] . It is activated within the inflammasome multiprotein complex via interaction with ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a carboxy-terminal CARD), a bipartite adapter protein that bridges NLRs and caspase-1 [62] .\n\nThe proinflammatory cytokines of the IL-1 family, most notably IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 play very important roles in antimicrobial host defense [63] . IL-1\u03b2 activates the release of other proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-6, and induce a Th17 bias in the cellular adaptive responses as shown in Figure 1 [64] . It is also responsible for the acute phase response, which includes fever, acute protein synthesis, anorexia, and somnolence.\n\nand coordinates programs as diverse as cellular recruitment to the site of infection or injury and regulation of sleep, appetite, and body temperature [65] . IL-18 is another member of the IL-1 family that acts as an important regulator of innate and acquired immune responses. It is produced during chronic inflammation, in autoimmune diseases, in a variety of cancers, and in the context of numerous infectious diseases [66] . IL-18 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f induces the production of multiple cytokines including IFN-\u03b3, IL-13, IL-4, IL-8 as well as both Th1 and Th2 lymphokines, and is an important stimulator of antigen-activated Th1 cells [67] . Through these mechanisms, cytokines of the IL-1 family are a crucial component of the host defense [63, 68] .\n\nProinflammatory stimuli induce expression of the inactive IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 proforms, but cytokine maturation and release are controlled by inflammasomes [61, 65] . It is now generally accepted that activation and release of IL-1\u03b2 requires two distinct signals. The nature of these signals in-vivo during infection or inflammation is not completely defined [17, 58, 69] . However, in-vitro studies showed that the first signal can be triggered by various PAMPs and DAMPs following toll-like receptor (TLR) activation, which induces the synthesis of pro IL-1\u03b2 [17, 70] . The second signal is triggered by different DAMPS and PAPMS promoting NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and caspase-1-mediated activation of pro IL-1\u03b2 and pro IL-18. The requirement for a second signal for IL-1\u03b2 maturation might constitute a fail-safe mechanism to ensure that the induction of potent inflammatory responses occurs only in the presence of a bona fide stimulus, such as pathogen infection and/or tissue injury [71] . Signals required for activation and secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 are summarized in Figure 2 .\n\nNLRP3 is activated upon exposure to whole pathogens, as well as a number of structurally diverse PAMPs, DAMPs, and environmental irritants [65] . A number of hostderived molecules, which are indicative of injury, activate the NLRP3 inflammasome.\n\nATP and certain bacterial toxins, such as nigericin and maitotoxin, cause a change in the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f intracellular ion composition leading to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome [72] .\n\nThe NLRP3 inflammasome also detects signs of metabolic stress, including elevated extracellular glucose and monosodium urate (MSU) crystals. Three models have been proposed to explain the mechanisms leading to NLRP3 activation; the first model adopts pore formation in cellular membrane as a mechanism that allows extracellular NLRP3\n\nagonists to access the cytosol and directly interact with NLRP3 [73] . A second model was proposed for activators that form crystalline or particulate structures, such as silica, asbestos, amyloid \u03b2, and alum, wherein engulfment of these agonists by phagocytes leads to lysosomal damage, resulting in cytosolic release of lysosomal contents that are somehow sensed by the NLRP3 inflammasome [74, 75] . According to a third model, all NLRP3 agonists trigger the generation of reactive Oxygen species (ROS), and this common pathway engages the NLRP3 inflammasome [76] . The production of ROS represents one of the most evolutionarily conserved pathways of response to infection or injury. The source of ROS is under debate where some studies claim one or several NADPH oxidases to be involved, while others support mitochondrial origin [76] . A recent report associates a ROS-sensitive NLRP3 ligand, thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP/VDUP1), in NLRP3 activation [77] .\n\nInflammation has always been associated with viral infections, raising the question of which viral PAMPs are responsible for induction of inflammatory response [57] .\n\nRecently several studies have linked activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes and production of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2 to viral infections such as influenza A virus (IAV), J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f hepatitis C virus (HCV) and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) [78] [79] [80] as summarized in Figure 3 .\n\nIchinohe et al. investigated the mechanism by which influenza virus activates the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway [79] . TLR7 of dendritic cells recognizes influenza genomic RNA, providing signal 1 that is required for the transcription and synthesis of pro IL-1\u03b2\n\nand pro IL-18 [79] . The second signal is provided by M2 ion channel activity across the trans-Golgi network (TGN) [81] . M2 protein was reported to assist in influenza viral entry into the cell by equilibrating the pH of the virus within the acidifying endosome.\n\nThis step crucial to facilitate replication of the viral genome by disruption of the interactions between the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex and the matrix protein, M1, which coats the vRNP [41] . In addition, the M2 channel allows protons from the acidic TGN to neutralize the pH of its lumen in order to prevent the premature maturation of hemagglutinin to its low-pH fusogenic form [79, 81] . [79] . It was also shown that bone marrow derived macrophages (BMMs) and bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), stimulated with LPS (signal 1) and transduced with a lentivirus expressing the M2 protein derived from H1N1, were capable of producing both IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 compared to controls. In unprimed BMM, however, M2 expression alone was not sufficient to trigger IL-1\u03b2 release. This confirms the hypothesis that pathogen-encoded ion channels, in addition to more drastic disruption of membranes by pore-forming toxins or membrane rupture, can trigger signal 2 for NLRP3 inflammasome activation [79] . In a different study, it was reported that M2-dependent IL-1\u03b2 production of influenza virus could be blocked by high concentration of extracellular K + or by treating cells with ROS inhibitors [83] . M2 and NLRP3 dependent IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 secretion also occurs in human dendritic cells infected with influenza virus [84] .\n\nA recent study [85] showed that infection with RSV triggers NLRP3 activation via reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, where elevated levels of IL-1\u03b2 were produced by RSV-infected airway cells. RSV can activate NLRP3/ASC inflammasome via activation of the TLR2/MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response 88)/nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) pathway for pro IL-1\u03b2 synthesis. The second signal, however, was shown to be provided by a small hydrophobic (SH) viroporin encoded by RSV [85] [86] [87] .\n\nAnother study by Triantafilou et al. [88] confirmed these findings and showed that SH viroporin accumulates in the Golgi within lipid raft structures, forming ion channels selective for monovalent cations (Na + and K + ). This triggers the translocation of NLRP3\n\nfrom the cytoplasm to the Golgi and its activation. Moreover an SH deletion mutant RSV J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f rgRSV-GF (\u0394SHRSV lacking the viroporin SH) can grow and replicate efficiently in cell culture but is unable to trigger inflammasome activation or stimulate the production of IL-1\u03b2 [88] . However, in the same study, IL-6 a non-inflammasome cytokine, as well as\n\nIFN\u03b2 and pro IL-1\u03b2 were produced normally [88] . Several viroporin inhibitors were also examined in RSV infected cellular models. HMA and Benzamil were successful in inhibiting IL-1\u03b2 secretion upon RSV infection [51, 88] .\n\nInflammasome activation was also studied in coronavirus and rhinovirus, both of which possess viroporins. Studies have shown elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 in both infections [64] . A study by Dolinay et al. [89] showed that inflammasomeregulated cytokines IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2 are crucial mediators of acute lung injury in mouse models, implicating the important role of inflammasome pathway and its downstream cytokines in respiratory inflammation [89] .\n\nIn rhinovirus infection, activation of NLRP3 and NLRC5 was reported in several studies [51, 90, 91] \n\nhigher IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2 levels ,not only in the blood of the patients, but also in lungs and lymphoid tissues, indicating increased inflammasome activation [93] [94] [95] . Corona virus encodes two viroporins; E protein and 3a protein, which act as ion-conductive pores in planar lipid bilayers and are required for maximal SARS-CoV replication and virulence.\n\nThey could possibly be responsible for inflammasome activation [49, 96] . It was recently shown that the SARS 3a protein activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in lipopolysaccharide-primed macrophages by affecting K + efflux and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species [93] . Another study showed that the SARS-CoV open reading frame 3a (ORF3a) accessory protein activates the NLRP3 inflammasome by promoting TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3)-mediated ubiquitination of apoptosisassociated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) [97] .\n\nOne study investigated the production of IL-1\u03b2 from macrophages following classical swine fever virus (CSFV) infection [98] . Indeed, after CSFV infection IL-1\u03b2 was upregulated through caspase-1 activation. Furthermore, CSFV viroporin p7 protein (a viroporin involved in modification of Ca 2+ membrane permeability) induces IL-1\u03b2 secretion which can be inhibited by the ion channel blocker amantadine [99, 100] [ [101] [102] [103] [104] .\n\nThe hypothesis that p7 activity is involved in CSFV-mediated IL-1\u03b2 production was supported in one study where macrophages 3D4/2 were transfected with either plasmids J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f pEGFP-p7 or pEGFP-C3 [105] . Increased expression of both IL-1\u03b2 mRNA and secretion of IL-1\u03b2 in p7 expressing cells was reported [105] .\n\nIn a study of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) activity, Ito et al. [106] reported that the virus activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in mouse dendritic cells and macrophages. [106] . Ca 2+ flux from intracellular storages to the cytosol can be the mechanism by which EMCV activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, since IL-1\u03b2 production was not affected by inhibitors of mitochondrial ROS and cathepsin B, which effectively blocked ATP and alum-induced IL-1\u03b2 secretion, respectively [106] . Another member of the picornaviridae family is foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Both FMDV RNA and viroporin 2B were shown to stimulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation by elevation of intracellular ion, but not dependent on mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lysosomal cathepsin B [107] .\n\nHCV p7 is a small hydrophobic viroporin of 63 amino acids [108] . P7 was reported to substitute for the well-characterized M2 vioporin of Influenza [44] where it was able to dissipate the proton gradient across exocytic vesicles as well as the TGN to prevent acid induced premature fusogenic conformational changes of multi basic haemagglutinin [43] .\n\nThe ion channel was also reported to cause global loss of organelle acidity upon expression [31] . Reports have shown that IL-1\u03b2 levels are higher in HCV induced liver diseases than in other forms of liver damage, however the mechanism by which HCV infection activates NLRP3 is still under investigation [17, 78, 109] . Furthermore, introduction of HCV viroporin p7 RNA into THP-1 cells was sufficient to cause IL-1\u03b2 secretion [110] .\n\nWhen p7 constructs of different genotypes were expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells, as well as in murine macrophage (RAW 264.7) cells [50, 78] , the effects of extracellular concentrations of H + concentration and the channel blocker rimantadine on cytokine production were demonstrated [78] . In LPS-primed macrophages, p7 increased levels of IL-1\u03b2 in a genotype dependent manner. Treatment of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f transfected cells with rimantadine abolished p7-induced effects completely, in agreement with the pH-response profile of p7 channels, concluding that p7 with its proton conductance activity can provide the second signal required for inflammasome activation [78, 111] .\n\nIn another report [17] , the hepatic macrophage/HCV interface and IL-1\u03b2 production through the NLRP3 inflammasomes was revealed. Following virus uptake in macrophages, HCV proteins are transiently produced but then decay. HCV proteins have been shown to stimulate ROS accumulation and regulate ion efflux [109, 112, 113] .\n\nMoreover, the HCV p7 protein activity was suggested to impart NLRP3 inflammasome activation during HCV infection by providing the required signal 2 [17] .\n\nIn the past decade, the NLRP3 inflammasome has been described as an important clustering permits autocleavage and formation of the active caspase-1 p10/p20 tetramer.\n\nCaspase-1 is activated within the inflammasome multiprotein complex through interaction with ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a carboxyterminal CARD), a bipartite adapter protein that bridges NLRs and caspase-1. \n\nIt is involved in viral virulence in swine, pore formation and modification of Ca 2+ membrane permeability.\n\nIt is needed for polyprotein processing and is essential for a late step in viral assembly and release of infectious virions. Plays an essential role in the production of virus particles. Dissipate the proton gradient of the acidic vesicular compartments, causing leakage of protons into the cytosol. This inhibition of acidification is required for the production of virus particles.\n\nDisruption of H + , K + , and Ca2 + homeostasis across intracellular vesicles provides signal 2 for NLRP3 activation. [32, 33, 36, 38, 39, 48, [127] [128] [129] [130] [131] [132] [133] [134] [135] [136] it has a C-terminal extension that harbors exclusively an FIIND motif and a CARD, which was shown to recruit caspase-5 or a second caspase-1. N-terminal PYD interacts with PYD of ASC whose CARD can recruit pro-caspase-1.\n\nTwo steps activation process involving primary activation by microbial ligands followed by rNTP binding to the nucleotide binding domain of NLRP1. It is also involved in inflammasomes response to anthrax lethal toxin [57, 137, 138] \n\nFound mainly in immune cells, epithelial cells, and osteoblasts. The core structure of the NALP3 inflammasome is formed by NALP3, the adaptor ASC, and caspase-1. PYD-PYD and CARD-CARD homotypic interactions are crucial for the recruitment and activation of either the adaptor ASC or the inflammatory caspases. It does not have the NALP1 Cterminal extension; instead, CARDINAL (a protein very similar to the NALP1 C terminus) interacts with other inflammasomes.\n\nRNA viruses activate NLRP3 either via RNA-sensing kinase PKR or other signals such as viroporins mediated ionic disturbance, ROS, uric acid. NALP3 also selectively binds ATP/dATP, and nucleotide binding is necessary for oligomerization of the NACHT domain.\n\nSGT1-HSP90 complex binds the NALP3 LRR domain [24, 59, [138] [139] [140] \n\nExpressed in brain, macrophages and myeloid cells-rich tissues such as spleen, lung, and liver. It contains an N-terminal CARD, a central NACHT domain and C-terminal LRRs.\n\nNLRC4/IPAF forms an inflammasome that activates caspase-1 in response to flagellin monomers in an ASC-independent manner, independent of TLR5. [24, 59, 139, 141, 142] \n\nIt has N-terminal DAPIN (pyrin) domain and C-terminal HIN-200 domain which has two oligonucleotide binding folds.\n\nAIM2 induces caspase-1 activation upon sensing nucleic acids, has been suggested to be critical for the activation of host defense against vaccinia virus and Francisella tularensis. C terminal of HIN domain can bind to dsDNA leading to oligomerization of inflammasome complex. [143, 144] "}
