{"title": "Emerging viral diseases of livestock in the developing world", "body": "Prompt implementation of these procedures has helped in quick identification of the etiology as well as expeditious application of control measures in case of SARS, MERS, and H5N1, H1N1 and H7N9 influenza outbreaks in various parts of the world as well as bluetongue disease caused by serotype 8 virus in Europe. However, in most of the developing countries such practices only remain as policies. As a consequence, reemergence of an old virus or emergence of a novel virus is only uncovered when the disease has spread widely.\n\nInfected population and patients provide valuable data regarding spread of the virus, pathogenesis of disease and immune response to the virus. These information need to be supported by robust modeling and prediction programs. This can only be achieved by assembling multidisciplinary teams, which include clinicians/veterinarians, virologists, pathologists, epidemiologists, statisticians and field workers. Of note, during outbreak of foot and mouth disease in United Kingdom during 2001, three different models were utilized to predict the progression of disease and to take appropriate control measures [6].\n\nSeveral viral diseases, including chikungunya and dengue, lack appropriate experimental animal models that closely mimic the disease in natural hosts. The main reasons are inability of the viruses to infect and replicate in experimental animals and differences in the immune system of natural host versus experimental animals. To address these limitations, humanized mouse models have been developed. Such models would greatly assist designing of prevention programs, prophylaxis and therapeutic strategies, and diagnostic tools. In veterinary virology, similar experimental models play a key role for understanding the pathogenesis of viral diseases of large animals and wild species.\n\nMost of the technologies arise from basic understanding of disease pathogenesis. Therefore, studies to decipher the molecular and cellular cross-talk between host immune cells and virus, documentation of immune evasive strategies of virus as well as systems biology approaches must be supported without bias. As compared to progress in humans, the immune system of domestic and wild animals is not yet explored in depth. In particular, the detailed phenotype and molecular analysis of antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages; the T cell subsets and B cells are lacking. This constitutes a major hurdle for developing effective control measures in livestock, and it can have a spillover effect in the case of zoonotic diseases.\n\nDespite our success in eradicating or controlling a handful of diseases, infectious diseases remain a grave concern to human and animal life and productivity. Importantly, more research is needed on vaccines and adjuvants, which induce rapid and long-lasting protective immune responses. Unlike bacterial vaccines, viral vaccines should induce both cellular and humoral immunity. While cellular immune responses clear virus-infected cells and reduce virus burden, humoral responses neutralize cell-free viruses. Although oil adjuvants have replaced alum in most of the current veterinary vaccines, further work is necessary to identify adjuvants with precise cellular and molecular mechanisms, to improve vaccine delivery systems and to promote new generation vaccines. Some of the recent inventions in human vaccinology and immunology could be considered for further exploration in veterinary virology. They include microneedle-based vaccine delivery systems, and adjuvants that target toll-like receptors, immunosuppressor cells such as regulatory T cells [1, 4, 5, 11, 13]. Advancements in the domain of foot and mouth disease virus could serve as an example and inspiration in this regard. However, cost-effective analysis of such new approaches is mandatory.\n\nThis special issue of \u201cIndian Journal of Virology\u201d on \u201cEmerging viral diseases of livestock in the developing world\u201d is aimed at providing insights on epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention, immunity, vaccines and experimental models pertaining to emerging viral diseases.
