{"title": "The Pediatric Burden of Human Coronaviruses Evaluated For 20 Years NIH Public Access", "body": "Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were first identified as causes of acute upper respiratory infection (URI) in the 1960s 1, 2 . Two HCoVs designated OC43 and 229E were established as human pathogens, but the difficulty in culturing HCoV from clinical specimens hindered comprehensive epidemiologic studies. HCoVs OC43 and 229E have been associated with lower respiratory infection (LRI) in several populations including young children, elderly persons, immunocompromised individuals, and military recruits using both culture and molecular methods. 3 These studies have been limited, however, by either small sample sizes or short periods of assessment since individual coronaviruses may not circulate yearly. 4, 5 Recently, three new HCoV associated with LRI have been described: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 6 , HCoV-Netherlands (HCoV-NL63) 7, 8 , and HCoV Hong Kong (CoV-HKU1) 9 . The discovery of these new HCoVs, and improved molecular detection methods have renewed interest in the two previously identified HCoVs, OC43 and 229E.\n\nThe objectives of the current study were to use molecular tools to define the incidence and clinical features of URI and LRI associated with HCoV-NL63, OC43 and 229E during a 20\n\nyear period in a large cohort of otherwise healthy children followed prospectively during multiple respiratory seasons.\n\nThis study used archival nasal wash specimens prospectively collected in the Vanderbilt Vaccine Clinic (VVC), a primary care clinic established in August 1972 to evaluate investigational vaccines in young children and to conduct surveillance for respiratory viruses [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Healthy, full-term infants were enrolled at birth and followed until 5 years of age. Children with co-morbid conditions other than mild asthma were excluded. Pediatricians trained in infectious diseases and nurse practitioners conducted all sick and well-child visits. History and physical examination findings were recorded on a standardized clinical form. Investigators were instructed to collect a nasal wash if a child presented with fever >38.3\u00b0C, acute otitis media, or LRI (defined below). Specimens were kept on ice and processed immediately for viral cultures with an aliquot snap-frozen and stored at -70\u00b0C. All samples were cultured for viral respiratory pathogens on human neonatal kidney, HEp-2, rhesus monkey kidney, human embryonic lung cell lines and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (during influenza season).\n\nDiagnoses were assigned during the visit by the clinical provider. LRI was defined as epiglottitis, laryngotracheobronchitis (croup), bronchiolitis, pneumonia, or asthma exacerbation. URI was defined as coryza, conjunctivitis, pharyngitis, otitis media, or otitis externa. A new episode of LRI or URI was defined as any visit with a diagnosis of LRI or URI that occurred at least 7 days after a previous visit. All studies were conducted with the approval of the Vanderbilt Medical Center Institutional Review Board.\n\nThe VVC database was queried to identify specimens obtained from children meeting the diagnosis of either LRI or URI from which a viral pathogen had not been identified at the time of the original clinic visit 14, 15 . RNA was manually extracted from LRI nasal wash samples with the use of the QIAamp Viral RNA kit (Qiagen) 14 and from URI samples with a Qiagen BioRobot 9604 Workstation using QIAamp Viral RNA kits (Qiagen) 15 . Specimens were tested for HCoV OC43, 229E, and HCoV-NL63 as described below. In addition, specimens infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV), influenza or adenovirus were tested for co-detection with HCoV. These samples were chosen during years of high HCoV circulation.\n\nRNA was tested by real-time RT-PCR (Quantitect Probe RT-PCR, Qiagen) using primers and probes for the nucleocapsid (N) genes of the specific HCoV strains of interest 7, 16 . To test for RNA integrity in archival samples, all URI specimens were tested for glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) using a commercial test (Applied Biosystems). LRI samples were not tested for GAPDH due to limited sample volumes.\n\nThe proportion of LRI and URI episodes associated with HCoV in the specimens available for testing was determined. This proportion was then extrapolated to all episodes of URI and LRI without an identified etiology (including those with and without available specimens for testing) to determine the overall number of LRI and URI episodes associated with HCoV ( Figure 1 , online only). Incidence was calculated by multiplying the number of LRI and URI episodes by the estimated proportion of LRI and URI episodes with detectable HCoV and then dividing by the total child-years of follow-up for the clinic population. Because some specimens were missing or depleted and some nasal wash specimens were never obtained for some episodes of LRI and URI, we examined the association between specimen availability and sex, race, age, follow-up time, examination year, and the presence of fever using multivariable logistic regression. To account for possible selection bias associated with specimen availability, we computed the proportion of LRI and URI with detectable HCoV weighted by the inverse of the probability of the specimen being available based on these covariates 17 . Details of these estimations including calculation of confidence intervals are found in the Appendix (online only).\n\nFisher's exact test was used to compare URI and LRI diagnoses among HCoV and other common respiratory viruses. Data were analyzed using STATA version 9 (Statacorp, College Station, TX) and R version 2.4.1 (Vienna, Austria).\n\nSubjects and Specimens Tested-Available LRI specimens were collected between July 1977 and December 2001. The study cohort during these 24 years included 1830 children with a total follow-up time of 3958 child years (mean 2.2 years per child). The clinic population was 51% male, 58% Caucasian, and 36% African-American. There were 1287 visits for 948 episodes of LRI (240 episodes per 1000 child years). The population diagnosed with an LRI was 58% male, 59% Caucasian, and 36% African-American and the median age was 14.5 months. The incidence of LRI was 383 per 1000 child-years <6 months, 246 per 1000 childyears 6 to 23 months and 154 per 1000 child years 2 to 5 years of age. Figure 1A (online only) outlines the availability of LRI nasal wash specimens. Of 948 LRI episodes, 553 (58%) specimens were obtained. Compared with children with LRI without samples, subjects with a specimen were similar (p>0.05) with respect to sex, race, years of follow-up, and date of clinic visit, but tended to be younger and more likely to have had their temperature recorded (p<0.0001 for both). Of the 553 nasal wash specimens originally obtained, 313 had no known viral etiology. Of these, 119 had residual aliquots available for testing. Unavailable specimens had been lost, discarded, or depleted. Subjects with available specimens tended to be younger (p=0.03) and to have had a more recent clinic visit (p=0.01).\n\nHCoV Detection in LRI Specimens-Of the 119 LRI nasal wash specimens available for testing, five (4.2%) were positive for HCoV-NL63 RNA, five (4.2%) for OC43, and none were positive for 229E, yielding a total of 8.4% HCoV positivity in LRI samples tested. All children with identified HCoV were less than 2 years of age. Table 1 summarizes the clinical characteristics and diagnoses of the ten children with HCoV-NL63 and OC43 LRI. Half of the HCoV-infected children were diagnosed with concomitant acute otitis media. Clinical characteristics did not differ between the two viruses, though the numbers were small. No child with LRI associated with either HCoV-NL63 or OC43 was hospitalized. One child with HCoV-NL63 had a chest radiograph performed that showed a diffuse infiltrate.\n\nEstimated Proportion and Incidence of HCoV-Associated LRI-The estimated overall percentage of LRI associated with any HCoV was 4.8% (95% CI 2.4%, 8.1%). The percentage of LRI associated with HCoV-NL63 was 2.4% (95% CI 0.9%, 5.0%), with OC43 was 2.4% (95% CI 0.9%, 5.0%), and with 229E was 0% (95% CI 0%, 0.9%). These estimates assumed no co-infection and that the specimens not available for testing had a similar proportion of HCoV to those available. To examine the sensitivity of results to the latter assumption, we re-estimated the proportion of HCoV-associated LRI accounting for the differing patient characteristics between available and unavailable specimens. In these adjusted analyses, the estimated percentage of LRI associated with any HCoV, HCoV-NL63, or OC43, were 4.6%, 2.6%, and 1.9%, respectively, similar to the unadjusted estimates.\n\nThe overall incidence of HCoV-associated LRI was 11.4 episodes per 1000 child-years (95% CI: 5.8, 19.3), but varied substantially with age ( Table 2) with HCoV not detected in any children with LRI \u22652 years of age. The incidence for children 0-23 months was 17.2 episodes of HCoV-associated LRI/1000 child-years (95% CI: 8.8, 28.9) and the peak incidence was in children 6-23 months at 22 episodes of HCoV-associated LRI/1000 child-years (95% CI: 11.1, 37.7).\n\nCo-detection-Sixty-nine LRI specimens previously positive for RSV, hMPV, PIV, influenza, or adenovirus were tested for HCoV-NL63 and 46 of these were tested for OC43 and 229E (23 specimens were depleted after HCoV-NL63 testing). One specimen was positive for HCoV-NL63, one for OC43, and none were positive for 229E. Therefore, including HCoV co-detection and assuming similar HCoV co-detection rates among untested specimens with a known viral etiology, the percentage of LRI associated with any HCoV increased slightly to 6.3%, corresponding to an overall incidence of 15.2 episodes per 1000 child-years.\n\nSubjects and Specimens Tested-Because of limited freezer storage, only URI specimens from January 1982 through December 2001 were available for testing. The study cohort during that period comprised 1481 children with 50% male, 59% Caucasian, and 35% African-American and included 6724 episodes of URI. Children with URI episodes were 53% male, 61% Caucasian and had a median age of 14.3 months. Of the 6724 URI episodes, 4080 had a nasal wash collected. A specimen was more likely to be collected if the patient was younger (p=0.04), had longer follow-up (p<0.0001), had a more recent clinic visit (p<0.0001), was diagnosed with acute otitis media (p<0.0001), or had a recorded temperature (p=0.0004).\n\nThere were 2082 URI specimens ( Figure 1B , online only) with no known viral etiology available for testing. These specimens did not differ statistically from the general clinic specimens with respect to age, length of follow-up, visit date, or race (p>0.05), but specimens from males (p=0.01), from children with acute otitis media (p=0.03) and from children with a lower temperature (p=0.04) were more likely to be available. Of available URI samples, 1735 (83%) had detectable GAPDH and were included in the analysis. Samples were less likely to have degraded if they had been collected more recently (p<0.0016) or were from a child with acute otitis media (p<0.034).\n\nHCoV Detection in URI Specimens-Of the 1735 URI samples available for testing with detectable GAPDH, 82 (4.7%) had detectable HCoV RNA, 49 (2.8%) with OC43 RNA, 25 (1.4%) with HCoV-NL63 RNA, and 8 (0.5%) with 229E. Table 3 highlights the signs, symptoms, and diagnoses of children with HCoV-associated URI. Clinical symptoms did not differ significantly among the three HCoV strains. Nearly two-thirds of all children with HCoV-associated URI had abnormal tympanic membranes and 51% were diagnosed with acute otitis media.\n\nproportion of URI associated with HCoV was 3.0%, (1.8% OC43, 0.9% HCoV-NL63, and 0.2% 229E). In contrast to HCoV-associated LRI, the percent of URI associated with HCoV was similar for each age group ( Table 2 ). The overall incidence of HCoV-associated URI was 67.3/1000 child-years. HCoV circulated more frequently in the winter months, with the majority detected between November and March ( Figure 2 ). The burden of URI attributable to HCoV varied substantially from year to year (Figure 3) . A single virus strain circulated in some seasons, while in others, two or even three viral strains were present. HCoV was not detected in two of the study years. Of 139 URI specimens previously positive for other viruses that we tested for HCoV, two were positive for OC43, two for HCoV-NL63, and none for 229E.\n\nUtilizing prospectively collected specimens and data from a unique longitudinal cohort, we determined the association between URI and LRI in otherwise healthy children <5 years of age with the previously described and new HCoVs. Using molecular tools, we assessed the 2-3 year periodicity of HCoV circulation suggested by earlier serologic studies. 4, 5 Although our study did not confirm this periodicity, it did show substantial year-to-year variation and highlighted how studying samples from just one or two years is problematic in determining overall HCoV burden.\n\nThe combined incidence of LRI associated with these HCoVs was 17.2/1000 child-years for children less than two years of age, with a substantial burden of disease associated with both OC43 and HCoV-NL63. The greatest incidence of LRI associated with these viruses was between 6-23 months of age, older than the peak age of < 6 months with RSV-associated LRI. 10 The biologic reason for this observation is unknown, but may relate to maternal antibody titers or differences in immunopathogenesis.\n\nPrevious studies of this same prospective cohort have used culture techniques and antigen testing to describe LRI caused by RSV, influenza, and PIV, and RT-PCR to describe hMPV. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] These prior studies spanned slightly different time periods, but showed that RSV was detected in more LRI than other viruses, with 37.8% of LRI episodes associated with RSV. 10 Influenza virus had an incidence of 8 LRI episodes per 1000 child-years 11 and PIV (including PIV 1, 2 and 3) was associated with 12 LRIs/1000 child-years in children 3-15 months of age 12 , comparable to the incidence of LRI associated with HCoV (17.2 episodes/1000 childyears for children less than two years of age). Since several of these prior studies used only culture techniques, they may have underestimated detection rates compared to RT-PCR methods, making direct comparisons of incidence difficult. More recently, Williams et al 14 detected hMPV in 12% of all LRI in this cohort using RT-PCR methods comparable to the techniques that were employed in the present study. Our data suggest that HCoVs are associated with a substantial proportion (approximately 8%) of LRI in children 6 to 23 months of age.\n\nOC43 was detected in 2.8% of LRI with an incidence of 8.6 episodes/1000 child years for children less than two years of age. While earlier studies described OC43 as a cause of URI, this strain appears also to be associated with LRI, similar to the newly discovered HCoV-NL63. None of the children with HCoV infection were hospitalized. Because of the exclusion of children born prematurely, infants with cardiopulmonary disease, and those with immunodeficiency from our surveillance population, the impact of the disease on these populations remains unknown.\n\nHCoV-NL63 was originally described in 2004. Although samples detecting HCoV-NL63 date back to 1988 in the literature 7 , our samples clearly showed that HCoV-NL63 has circulated since 1981 in Nashville, TN. To our knowledge, this is the oldest reported case of HCoV-NL63. Our report demonstrates HCoV-NL63 has been identified in children who have had URI and acute otitis media. Interestingly, 229E was not detected in the LRI specimens, although it has been associated with LRI in infants and older adults [18] [19] [20] and with less severe illness than OC43. 21 229E had the lowest prevalence in the URI specimens, which may be a result of collection of specimens primarily from children with acute otitis media, fever or LRI. Thus, we likely underestimated the burden of 229E-associated URI.\n\nNotably, half of the HCoV-infected children with LRI were diagnosed with acute otitis media while overall only 19% of children with LRI in the cohort were diagnosed with acute otitis media (p=0.03). Similarly, 51.2% of the children with HCoV-associated URI had acute otitis media. Thus, our data support previous reports that HCoV is associated with acute otitis media. 22 The detection rate of HCoV in healthy children has not been extensively studied and the samples obtained in our clinic during well visits are no longer available. One study done in atopic children found similar rates of detection of 229E and OC43 in children with respiratory illness (5.5%) and those who were asymptomatic (4.4%). 23 Recently Dare et al 24 tested specimens obtained from a group of healthy control patients for different human coronaviruses. HCoVs were not detected in the 34 well children less than one year of age and in only one of the 51 healthy children one to four years of age. Boivin et al, found HCoV-NL63 in 3.0% of children hospitalized for acute respiratory illness and 1.7% of asymptomatic children. Interestingly the mean age of symptomatic children was 10.1 months and 24.3 months for asymptomatic children (p=0.04). 25 These findings suggest that asymptomatic infection may be more common in older children. Additionally, co-detection of other viruses is also more common with the use of increasingly sensitive diagnostic tools. One recent study showed 27% of viral respiratory episodes were associated with the detection of more than one virus 26 . In that study, children with more than one virus detected were more likely to require hospitalization and were more likely to be <12 months of age.\n\nThis study has several limitations, most importantly the use of archival specimens and the unavailability of some specimens. Vigorous statistical attempts were made to control for these missing samples. In addition, another HCoV strain, HCoV-HKU1, was discovered recently and was not included in this study due to further depletion of samples. Hence the overall incidence of HCoV determined in this analysis likely underestimates the true burden since it does not include HCoV-HKU1. Despite the fact that HCoV strains were associated with 67 medically-attended URI visits/1000 child-years and a modest amount of LRI, it is still unclear if these viruses cause a significant enough burden of disease to warrant vaccine development. The exclusion of immunocompromised children or those with other chronic diseases likely underestimates the burden and severity of disease.\n\nIn summary, we have shown in a prospective longitudinal cohort study of young children that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV OC43 strains are associated with a substantial burden of LRI and medically-attended URI in previously healthy outpatient children. The LRI clinical syndromes associated with HCoV infection include bronchiolitis and pneumonia and are similar to disease caused by other respiratory viruses. A high proportion of HCoV infections are associated with acute otitis media. Future studies in normal healthy children and in high-risk pediatric populations will further elucidate the impact of these viruses.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.\n\n\u2022 Dr. Talbot received salary support and career development from the NIH/NCRR (5 K12RR017697-05, Dr. Nancy Brown, PI Vanderbilt Mentored Clinical Research Scholar Program) and from the NIAID (1K23AI074863-01).\n\nThe Vanderbilt Vaccine Clinic was supported by GCRC center award RR 00095\n\nFlow diagram of lower (A) and upper respiratory infection (B) specimens available for testing.
