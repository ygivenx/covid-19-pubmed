{"title": "SERUM ANTIBODY RESPONSES OF NEONATAL AND YOUNG ADULT PIGS TO TRANSMISSIBLE GASTROENTERITIS CORONAVIRUS", "body": "Serum titers of vlrus-neutrallzlng (VN) antibody were I0 to 16 times higher in neonatal pigs than in young adult pigs, after single oral doses of virulent transmissible gastroenteritls virus (TGEV).\n\nTo determine the reas~ for this higher response, sera from neonatal and young adult plgs, 18 to 21 days after exposure to TGEV, were collected and assayed for VN antibody by plaque reduction. In addition, sera of VN-posltive and VN-negatlve neonatal pigs were analyzed for immunoglobulin classes by radial immunodlffuslon technique.\n\nThe competence of neonatal pigs to produce VN antibody with increased IgG levels was demonstrated.\n\nThe higher antibody response seen in neonatal pigs, when compared to sera of young adult plgs, may be attributed to the increased replication of TGEV in the intestinal tracts of neonatal pigs or to the lack of other immunogens that may interfere or compete with the production of specific antibody.\n\nIn a previous study (Stone et al., 1977) , we observed that transmissible gastroenterltls virus (TGEV) neutralization serum tlters of neonatal pigs that survived the viral infection greatly exceeded those of adults given a comparable oral dose of virus.\n\nThere is some conflict as to the immunological competence of pigs at birth (Bourne et al., 1974; Kim et al., 1967; Sterzl et al., 1965) .\n\nIt is generally accepted: (a) that maternal antibodies are not transferred across the placenta in swine, (b) neonatal pigs are aglobullnemic at birth, and (e) after colostrum feeding, colostral globulins will transfer to the serum. In this study, we investigated antibody responses of neonatal and young adult pigs to TGE viral antigens to determine if the higher VN titer is due to a specific antibody present in the sera of colostrum-fed pigs.\n\nEight hysterectomy derived, colostrum deprived pigs; 66 colostrum-fed pigs;\n\nand 51 young adult pigs were used in this study. All pigs were from herds known to be free of TGE. The colostrum deprived pigs were fed a commercial bovine milk formula and kept in individual isolators equipped with air filters. The neonatal pigs were infected with TGEV at 3 to 4 days of age. The young adults were infected at 6 to 8 months of age. All pigs were bled for serum 18 to 21 days after inoculation and the serum samples were kept at -20 C and heated to 56 C for 30 minutes before use.\n\nThe virulent Miller-3 strain of TGEV was given orally to infect all pigs (Stone et al., 1977) .\n\nThe 8th serial passaged cell culture TGEV was diluted to contain about i00 plaque-forming units per 0.i ml in virus neutralization (VN) tests (Kemeny, 1976 ).\n\nCultures of a continuous line of swine testicular cells grown in plastic plates were inoculated with 0.2 ml of the serum-virus mixtures and allowed to adsorb for 60 minutes at 37 C. The inoculated cell cultures were overlaid with agar and examined for plaques after incubation for 4S hours at 37 C in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2. Neutralization endpoints were calculated as the highest dilution of serum needed for a 50% reduction in the number of plaques.\n\nTotal protein was determined refractometrically.\n\nimmunoglobulins were estimated by the radial immunodlffuslon technique (Manclnl et al., 1965) using heavy chain specific rabbit antlporclne IgA, IgG, and IgM.\n\nNeonatal pigs and young adult pigs developed measurable VN antibody 18 to 21 days after exposure to virulent TGEV. The geometric mean VN tlter for the neonatal pigs was I0 to 16 times higher than that of young adults (TABLE I) . aAll pigs received colostrum on day i, and were removed from the sow on day 2. Pigs numbered 4, 5, and 6 were orally administered transmissible gastroenteritis virus on day 3.\n\nbHighest dilution of serum needed for a 50% reduction in number of plaques.\n\nCNot tested.\n\nThe mean value for total protein in the 6 neonatal sera was lower than for the mean value of 12 young adult pigs. An examination of the total protein or IgA contents in sera from 3 VN-negatlve and 3 VN-posltlve colostrum-fed pigs revealed little difference. However, there was a marked difference in the concentrations of IgG and IgM in these sera.\n\nThe IgG values in the VN-posltlve sera were about twice the concentration of the VN-negatlve sera.\n\nIn contrast,\n\nthe IgM values were higher in the VN-negatlve sera.\n\nThe data clearly show the competence of the neonatal pig to produce high levels of VN antibody.\n\nOthers have reported the immunological competency of the porcine fetus to Salmonella paratyphl B (Sterzl et al., 1965) , to parvovlrus (Mengellng and Cutllp, 1976) , and to sheep red blood cells (Schultz et al., 1971 ). The differences seen between the IgG and IgM levels of the VN-negatlve and VN-posltlve pigs (TABLE II) may represent a recent immune response of the VN-negatlve pigs to organisms in the environment, or the IgG in these pigs may be residual from the ingested colostrum. The colostral contribution of IgM would be low as the calculated mean half-llfe of IgM is 4.8 days, whereas the half-llfe of IgG is 13.8 days (Curtis and Bourne, 1973) . Moon et al., 1975 , demonstrated that 3-day-old pigs are more susceptible to TGEV infection and produce more virus in their intestines than older pigs. The increased replication of the virus in the intestinal tracts of neonatal pigs may provide a greater antigenic mass and may have caused a greater antibody response in neonatal pigs. Alternatively, the neonatal pigs may have had fewer other (extraneous) antigens to interfere with the formation of specific antibody."}
