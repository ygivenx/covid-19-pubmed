{"title": "Supplementary Materials: Chromatography (HPLC) with Quadrupole-Time-of- 3 Flight Mass Spectroscopy (qTOF-MS) and Antiviral Activities of Phlorotannins from Ecklonia cava", "body": "The viral-infected cells were exposed to compounds 11, 12, 13, and 14 (20 \u00b5M) and 107 ribavirin (20 \u00b5M) as a positive control. After 1 day of incubation, the cell lysates were 108 collected and target proteins were measured using Western blotting method. Equal amounts 109 of proteins were loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After transferred to PVDF 110 membranes, they were firstly incubated with neuraminidase antibody overnight. For 111 removing bound primary and secondary antibodies, the membranes were incubated with a 112\n\nRestore TM Western blot stripping buffer (Thermo Sci.) and they were then detected the \u03b2-113 actin protein using a LAS4000 luminescent image analyzer. Sample names were from 1-7 114 as follows: uninfected ctrl, viral-infected (vi) ctrl, vi + ribavirin (20 \u00b5M), vi + 11, 12, 13, 115 and 14 (20 \u00b5M), respectively. Data were included in the final analysis in Figure 4A . 116 Figure S179 . Inhibitory effects of compound 12 on the viral proteins synthesis in a 118 concentration-dependent manner; original uncropped blots. 119\n\nThe procedure of Western blot experiment was successfully carried as above described in 120 Figure S18 . The membranes were firstly detected neuraminidase or hemagglutinin proteins. 121 "}
