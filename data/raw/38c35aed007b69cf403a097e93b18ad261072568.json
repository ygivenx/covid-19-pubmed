{"title": "Modelling SARS-CoV-2 Dynamics: Implications 3 for Therapy", "body": "We analysed data describing SARS-CoV-2 viral loads reported by Zou et al. 81 (1) and MERS-CoV viral loads reported by Oh et al. (8) using a simple mathematical 82 model (see Methods). To consider inter-individual variations in viral loads, a 83 nonlinear mixed-effect modelling approach was employed to estimate parameters 84 (see Methods). The estimated parameters and initial values are listed in Table 1 , 85 and the typical behaviour of the model using these best-fit parameter estimates is 86\n\nshown together with the data in Fig. 1A for SARS-CoV-2 (pink) and MERS-CoV 87 (black and grey for severe and mild case, respectively). In addition, to parameterise 88 and compare these coronaviruses infections, we calculated the following important 89 quantities ( Fig. 2) using estimated parameter values; the mean length of virus 90 production of an infected cell ( = 1/ ), the within-host basic reproduction number 91 ( 0 = / ) which is the average number of newly infected cells produced by any 92 single infected cell (9), and the critical inhibition rate ( * = 1 \u2212 1/ 0 ) induced by 93 antivirals to prevent primary virus infection (10, 11) . We showed that is not 94 significantly different for SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. However, interestingly, we 95 found that 0 and * for SARS-CoV-2 are significantly different from analogous 96 values for mild cases of MERS-CoV ( = 8.9 \u00d7 10 \u22124 and 2.0 \u00d7 10 \u22126 by the bootstrap 97 t-test, respectively), but not for severe MERS-CoV ( = 0.41 and 0.41) (see Fig. 2) , 98 although we were unable to separate mild and severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 due to 99 limited clinical information for the cases. This demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 100 causes infection more effectively than in mild cases of MERS-CoV, but a general 101 SARS-CoV-2 infection follows infection dynamics that are similar to severe cases 102 due to MERS-CoV. In addition, as a median estimate, 65% inhibition of the initial 103 virus expansion is required to prevent the establishment of SARS-CoV-2 infection 104 (we provide a detailed analysis later). We also calculated the duration of infection in 105 which the viral load is above the detection limit ( ) in Table 1 , showing that SARS-106\n\nCoV-2 is maintained in hosts for more than a week based on the median estimate. 107 108\n\nTo extend our analysis to include SARS-CoV, we analysed SARS-CoV viral 111 loads in nasopharyngeal aspirate reported by Peiris et al. (12) and MERS-CoV viral 112 loads reported by Oh et al. (8) in sputum or tracheal aspirate. The estimated 113 parameters, viral load at symptom onset, and the indices derived from the estimated 114 parameters are listed in Table 1 and from bootstrap t-test) (Fig. 2) . This demonstrates that in vivo viral dynamics of 121 SARS-CoV infection are similar to those for MERS-CoV in mild cases but not in 122 severe cases. Collectively, the findings from the viral load data analyses for the two 123 different specimens (throat/nasal swabs and nasopharyngeal/sputum/tracheal 124 aspirate) implied that SARS-CoV-2 also causes infection more effectively than 125\n\nOur quantitative analyses provide insights into optimal usage of anti-SARS-129 (Fig. 3) . 136\n\nOne of the major mechanisms of action for antivirals is blocking de novo 139\n\ninfections. This can be induced by drugs including human neutralising antibodies, 140 viral entry-inhibitors and/or antibodies raised by vaccination (13, 14) . For example, a 141 SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody has been reported to cross react 142 with SARS-CoV-2 (14). We conducted in silico experiments with varying drug 143 efficacy (considering inhibition rates from 10% to 100%, i.e. 0.1 \u2264 \u2264 1) and with the 144 timing of initiation of therapy from 0 days (i.e., post-exposure prophylactic use of 145 antivirals) until 5 days after symptom onset (i.e., 0 \u2264 * \u2264 5) (see Methods). Our 146 results show that early initiation of therapy (especially within two to three days) with 147 even a relatively weak drug (inhibition rates as low as 50%) might effectively reduce 148 the area under the curve of viral load (AUC) and prevent significant reductions in the 149 numbers of target cells because of cytopathic effects due to cell invasion. A therapy 150 of this type initiated four days after symptom onset, on the other hand, is not 151 predicted to induce a clear antiviral effect (Fig. 3AD) . This suggests that blocking de 152 novo infections is not likely to be effective unless the intervention is initiated before 153 the peak viral load. Hence, appropriate initiation timing (i.e., before or very soon after 154 symptom onset) is an important factor for suppressing viral load in addition to the 155 therapy having the potential for antiviral effects. 156\n\nThe majority of antiviral drugs inhibit intracellular virus replication. Although 159 their antiviral efficacies need to be confirmed, lopinavir/ritonavir (HIV protease 160 inhibitors), remdesivir (anti-Ebola virus disease candidate) and other nucleoside 161 analogues, and interferon have the potential to suppress SARS-CoV-2 by blocking 162 virus production (15, 16) . Interestingly, our results suggest that, even for relatively 163 small inhibition rates of around 30%, the AUC of viral load is partially reduced if 164 therapy is initiated early (within three days after symptom onset) (Fig. 3BE) . 165\n\nHowever, if treatment is applied after the peak viral load, even drugs with 100% 166 inhibition rate are not able to reduce viral loads, which is similar to the predicted 167 outcomes of de novo blocking therapy. 168 169 (iii) Promoting cytotoxicity 170\n\nAnother possible antiviral mechanism is cytotoxic effects by adaptive 171 immunity including those mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Here, we assume 172 that promoting cytotoxicity increases the virus death rate by at most two times (i.e., 173 0.1 \u2264 \u2264 1), that is, achieves up to 50% reduction of the mean length of virus 174 production. Compared with the other two therapies (blocking de novo infection and 175\n\nvirus production), the induction of cytotoxicity had relatively mild effects on the AUC 176 reduction if initiated before peak viral load. However, cytotoxicity induction initiated 177 after peak viral load could effectively reduce the viral load AUC (Fig. 3CF) . This 178 implies that there is an optimal time to apply this therapy, and that significant antiviral 179 effects are expected unless the promoting rate is too low or therapy is initiated either 180 too early or too late. However, large reductions of target cells due to ongoing de 181 novo infection cannot be avoided even with very early initiation (i.e., immediately 182 after symptom onset) of the therapy. 183 All rights reserved.

The virus production effectively reduces AUC of SARS-CoV-2 load; for example, if the 193 therapy can reduce more than 90% of de novo infections and is initiated 3 days after 194 symptoms onset, the viral load AUC is expected to be reduced by 81.4% (Fig. 3DE) . 195\n\nHowever, if therapy is initiated after peak viral load (more than 2-3 days following 196 symptom onset), the effect on viral load AUC is limited. Compared with either 197 blocking de novo infection or virus production, promoting cytotoxicity showed 198 relatively mild effects on AUC reduction, however initiation of that therapy after the 199 peak viral load has the potential to still reduce viral load AUC (Fig. 3F) . 200\n\nThe effectiveness of the hypothetical drugs can be evaluated in detail using a 201 reported for SARS-CoV-2, a number of animal models exist for SARS-CoV including 206 mice, hamsters, ferrets, and macaques (17).

Such viral 209 load data would allow further investigation of the effectiveness of drugs with different 210 action mechanisms, which would be informative for development of appropriate 211 treatment strategies (i.e., the optimal dose/timing of antivirals) for SARS-CoV-2 212\n\nIn conclusion, effective treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections requires an 214 appropriate choice of class-specific drugs; otherwise, the antivirals do not alter the 215 viral load significantly and are wasted. Identification of SARS-CoV-2-specific virus 216 characteristics is needed to design optimal treatments and to ensure that limited 217 resources are deployed effectively. Additionally, effective combinations of anti-218 SARS-CoV-2 drugs and vaccines will maximise the impacts of control, reduce the 219 required drug dose and potentially limit side effects, all of which are highly desirable. 220\n\nOur theoretical approach could complement ongoing experimental investigations into 221\n\n19 treatment. To our knowledge, previous studies have neither characterised SARS-223\n\nCoV-2 dynamics in humans using viral dynamics models, nor compared the resulting 224 dynamics against those of other coronaviruses (i.e., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV). 225\n\nOur mathematical modelling approach has led to an improved understanding of the 226 characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 in vivo, and can be used to test possible treatments 227 for COVID-19 further going forwards. 228 All rights reserved.

(1) , Oh et al. (8) and Peiris et al. (12) , 232 respectively. To extract the data from images in those publications, we used the 233 program datathief III (version 1.5, Bas Tummers, www.datathief.org). We excluded 234 patients for whom data were measured on only one day, and assumed that viral load 235 values under the detection limit were set as the detection limit for the purposes of 236 fitting the model. We converted cycle threshold (Ct) values reported in Zou et al. (1) , 237\n\nOh et al. (8) and Peiris et al.

In other words, even though no drug administration trials 287 have been conducted yet, we were able to infer the efficacy of each drug treatment 288 based on our in silico experiments. We implemented the different mechanisms of 289 action in the model as follows: 290 (i) Blocking de novo infection.

Including a random effect amounts to a partial pooling of the data 323 between individuals to improve estimates of the parameters applicable across the 324 population of patients. By using this approach, the differences between viral 325 dynamics in different patients were not estimated explicitly, nor did we fully pool the 326 data which would bias estimates towards highly sampled patients. In this method of 327 estimation, each parameter estimate (= \u00d7 ) depends on the individual where 328 is fixed effect, and is random effect with an assumed Gaussian distribution with 329 mean 0 and standard deviation \u03a9.
