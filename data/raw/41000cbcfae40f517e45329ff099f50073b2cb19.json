{"title": "Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Nasal decongestants in monotherapy for the common cold (Review)", "body": "Single-dose decongestant versus placebo: 10 studies compared a single dose of nasal decongestant with placebo and their effectiveness was tested between 15 minutes and 10 hours after dosing. Seven of 10 studies reported subjective symptom scores for nasal congestion; none reported overall patient well-being. However, pooling was not possible due to the large diversity in the measurement and reporting of symptoms of congestion. Two studies recorded adverse events. Both studies used an oral decongestant and each of them showed that there was no statistical difference between the number of adverse events in the treatment group versus the placebo group.\n\nMulti-dose decongestant versus placebo: nine studies compared multiple doses of nasal decongestants with placebo, but only five reported on the primary outcome, subjective symptom scores for nasal congestion. Only one study used a topical decongestant; none reported overall patient well-being. Subjective measures of congestion were significantly better for the treatment group compared with placebo approximately three hours after the last dose (SMD 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.92; P = 0.02; GRADE: lowquality evidence). However, the SMD of 0.49 only indicates a small clinical effect. Pooling was based on two studies, one oral and one topical, therefore we were unable to assess the effects of oral and topical decongestants separately. Seven studies reported adverse events (six oral and one topical decongestant); meta-analysis showed that there was no statistical difference between the number of adverse events in the treatment group (125 per 1000) compared to the placebo group (126 per 1000). The odds ratio (OR) for adverse events in the treatment group was 0.98 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.40; P = 0.90; GRADE: low-quality evidence). The results remained the same when we only considered studies using an oral decongestant (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.39; P = 0.80; GRADE: low-quality evidence).\n\nWe were unable to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of single-dose nasal decongestants due to the limited evidence available. For multiple doses of nasal decongestants, the current evidence suggests that these may have a small positive effect on subjective measures of nasal congestion in adults with the common cold. However, the clinical relevance of this small effect is unknown and there is insufficient good-quality evidence to draw any firm conclusions. Due to the small number of studies that used a topical nasal decongestant, we were also unable to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of oral versus topical decongestants. Nasal decongestants do not seem to increase the risk of adverse events in adults in the short term. The effectiveness and safety of nasal decongestants in children and the clinical relevance of their small effect in adults is yet to be determined.\n\nWe wanted to find out if nasal decongestants used alone can ease nasal congestion symptoms in people with colds.\n\nColds, although not serious, are common illnesses responsible for many visits to family doctors and days lost from work and school. Cold symptoms include runny nose, sore throat and sneezing, and they can last up to two weeks. There is no cure for colds; treatments only ease the symptoms. Many people use over-the-counter medicines such as nasal decongestants to treat cold symptoms. However, Prim ary outcom e: subjective sym ptom score -3 hours af ter dosing ---540 (4 RCTs, oral) -Insuf f icient data to pool results Pseudoephedrine (Eccles 2005; Latte 2007; Taverner 1999) ; Phenylpropanolam ine (Cohen 1978) Prim ary outcom e: overall patient well-being -3 hours af ter dosing ---(0 studies) -Not reported\n\nSecondary outcom e: all adverse events Two single-dose trials reported adverse events ( Gronborg 1983; Taverner 1999) . Both used an oral decongestant. Taverner 1999 (pseudoephedrine versus placebo) reported no adverse events in either the treatm ent or the placebo group; we did not include Gronborg 1983 (norephedrine versus placebo) results in the m eta-analysis because a cross-over study design was used and several events per patient were reported -82 (2 RCTs, oral) -Insuf f icient data to pool results Norephedrine (Gronborg 1983) ; Pseudoephedrine (Taverner 1999)\n\nThe common cold is viral in nature, afflicts individuals of all ages and often necessitates utilisation of over-the-counter and prescription medications, and complementary interventions (Simasek 2007) . Often caused by the rhinovirus, people typically experience rhinorrhoea, sneezing, headache, nasal congestion, cough, fatigue and pharyngitis (Eccles 2000) . Despite the common cold not being a serious condition, it has a substantial impact in terms of time lost from work and school, as well as money spent on both prescription and over-the-counter medications (Heikkinnenn 2003) . In the USA, the common cold contributes to 22 million missed days from school and 20 million absences from work annually, including days missed due to caring for ill children (Pappas 2015) . In Australia, upper respiratory tract infections, nasal congestion, pharyngitis and cough constitute 11% of all consultations in general practice (Fry 1993) . In the USA, there are 25 million visits to the family physician annually due to the common cold and the total economic impact of the common cold reached around USD 40 billion annually (Fendrick 2003) .\n\nNasal congestion is one of the most uncomfortable symptoms experienced with the common cold (Fry 1993) . There is no cure for the common cold, therefore symptomatic therapy is the only treatment option. Nasal decongestants are widely utilised for symptomatic relief in both adults and children and can be administered in oral or topical form (Del Mar 2003) . Decongestants may contain pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine, oxymetazoline or xylometazoline. Nasal decongestants are available as tablets or nasal sprays or drops. They are mostly available over-the-counter without restrictions (Eccles 2009). It is recommended that they should not be given to children under the age of six years (NPS Medicinewise 2012). Due to the risk of rebound congestion after stopping use of decongestants it is advised that people should not use a decongestant for longer than five days. Nasal decongestants mainly act locally but there may be systemic effects, such as hypertension. Other common side effects include headache, nausea, insomnia and dizziness (NPS Medicinewise 2012). People taking topical nasal or ophthalmic decongestants quickly develop tachyphylaxis (a rapid decrease in the response to a drug after repeated doses over a short period of time). Long-term use is therefore not recommended, since the agents lose effectiveness after a few days. Previous reviews have considered the safety and efficacy of therapies for indications including seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinitis, common cold and influenza (Dolansky 2008).\n\nMany marketed treatments for the common cold exist and they may consist of multiple active agents with claimed decongestant, anti-secretory and anti-cough actions. Heated, humidified air is one type of treatment intervention. The mechanism of action includes the liquefying of mucus if it is dry, thereby allowing it to be cleared more effectively. It also works by the heat of the steam killing the cold virus that may be present in the mucus. However, it is not routinely recommended as there is insufficient evidence for its use (Singh 2013) .\n\nCorticosteroids are also used for the treatment of the common cold and have been recently reviewed (Hayward 2015) . Intranasal ipratropium bromide has been reviewed and was found to be effective in reducing rhinorrhoea but ineffective in reducing nasal congestion (AlBalawi 2013). A Cochrane Review of saline nasal irrigation has reported limited evidence of its efficacy in relieving symptoms of nasal secretion and nasal congestion in upper respiratory tract infections (King 2015) . Combination medications have also been studied. For overall recovery it has been reported that combinations of antihistamines, decongestants and analgesics have proven to be more effective compared to placebo (De Sutter 2012) . There was only a modest effect of oral antihistamine-decongestant combinations, oral decongestant-analgesic combinations and oral antihistamine-decongestant-analgesic combinations on nasal congestion. Only oral analgesic combinations seemed to have no effect on the symptoms of nasal congestion. Since these medications for the common cold have already been previously researched, this review will focus on nasal decongestants.\n\nTo assess the efficacy, and short-and long-term safety, of nasal decongestants used in monotherapy to alleviate symptoms of the common cold in adults and children.\n\nCriteria for considering studies for this review\n\nWe included RCTs and cluster-RCTs or randomised cross-over studies comparing nasal decongestants with placebo. We excluded quasi-RCTs.\n\nAdults and children of all ages and either gender with the common cold, characterised by defined symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), were eligible for inclusion. We included participants who had symptoms for no more than seven days prior to the start of the study. We excluded studies where another upper respiratory condition (such as influenza, sinusitis or rhinitis) had been diagnosed.\n\nOral or topical nasal decongestants versus placebo (oral or spray, as appropriate). We included trials using topical and oral nasal decongestants administered as aqueous spray, drops, dry powder, tablets or capsules. We focused on nasal decongestants only, which work by stimulating the alpha-adrenergic receptors in upper respiratory tract blood vessels, leading to vasoconstriction (Wicker 2009). We excluded studies reporting combined interventions such as warm humidified air, steam, aromatic vapours, inhaled corticosteroids and interventions using menthol.\n\nPrimary outcomes 1. Subjective symptom scores for nasal congestion (selfreported scores of congestion).\n\n2. Overall patient well-being score (self-reported).\n\n1. Objective measures of nasal airway resistance (NAR). 2. Adverse events (for example, dry mucous membranes, rebound congestion).\n\n3. Complications (for example, sinusitis, otitis media, lower respiratory tract infections).\n\n4. Time to full recovery. 5. Time to return to school or work.\n\nWe We used the search strategy as outlined in Appendix 1 to search MEDLINE and CENTRAL. We combined the MEDLINE search strategy with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials in MEDLINE (Lefebvre 2011; Appendix 1). We adapted the search strategy to search Embase (Appendix 2), CINAHL (Appendix 3), LILACS (Appendix 4) and Web of Science (Appendix 5). There were no language or publication restrictions.\n\nWe searched www.clinicaltrials.gov and www.anzctr.org.au to identify completed and ongoing trials (July 2016). We reviewed reference lists and contacted researchers in the field to identify further relevant studies. We contacted manufacturers of nasal decongestants for unpublished studies.\n\nThis review is based on our published protocol (Ta'i 2012).\n\nTwo review authors (LD, NM) independently reviewed and applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria to the titles and abstracts identified by the search. We retrieved the full text if there was insufficient information in the titles or abstracts to exclude a study. Three review authors (LD, NM, LG) reviewed full-text articles, ensuring that two review authors independently judged each article. We consulted a fourth review author (MLvD) if there was any discrepancy between the two authors and the issue was resolved by discussion. The review authors were not blinded to information about the article, such as the journal title, the authors of the articles or the results. We recorded the selection process in sufficient detail to complete a PRISMA flow diagram (Figure 1 ; Moher 2009) and Characteristics of excluded studies table. We did not impose any language restrictions.\n\nThree review authors (LD, NM, LG) independently extracted data from all included articles using pre-designed data extraction forms. A fourth author (MLvD) assisted in reaching a consensus if data entries differed. We extracted the following data:\n\n\u2022 First author, publication year, journal.\n\n\u2022 Number, age and gender distribution of the patients included in the trial.\n\n\u2022 Case definitions (symptoms and measurements).\n\n\u2022 Type, dosage, duration and route of administration of nasal decongestant.\n\n\u2022 Results (primary and secondary outcomes).\n\nIf a paper did not provide sufficient information about either study details or results, we contacted the authors where possible.\n\nThree review authors (LD, NM, LG) independently assessed risk of bias. We resolved disagreements by discussion with an arbiter (MLvD). We assessed:\n\n\u2022 random sequence generation;\n\n\u2022 allocation concealment;\n\n\u2022 blinding of participants and personnel (if relevant);\n\n\u2022 blinding of outcome assessors; \u2022 incomplete outcome data;\n\n\u2022 dropout/selective outcome reporting; and \u2022 other potential sources of bias.\n\nWe judged each potential source of bias as high, low or unclear and provided a quote from the study report together with a justification for our judgement in 'Risk of bias' tables. We summarised the risk of bias judgements across different studies for each of the domains listed. We reported the risk of bias using the 'Risk of bias' tool from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011).\n\nWe reported continuous data as the standardised mean difference (SMD) because subjective and objective measures of congestion were measured on different scales. The SMD adjusts for the differences in measurement scales and enables data from different scoring systems to be pooled; it is the absolute mean difference divided by the standard deviation (SD). Dichotomous outcomes were reported as odds ratios (ORs). SMDs and ORs were generated by RevMan software (RevMan 2014). We calculated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each estimate.\n\nWe analysed the outcomes of the individual participants of each trial. If the unit of randomisation was not the same as the level of analysis (i.e. the individual participants), such as in cluster-RCTs, we planned to make adjustments by taking into account the impact of clustering as outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011). If a trial included more than one treatment arm that was similar (such as different doses of the same nasal decongestant), we combined data from the treatment arms that were similar and compared this group to the control group, as recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, section 7.7.3.8 and Table 7 .7a (Higgins 2011).\n\nFor studies using a cross-over design, we reported results separately and did not include them in the meta-analysis.\n\nWe were unable to obtain additional data from study authors (many studies were quite old and authors could not be contacted). Therefore, where possible, we compared studies that used an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis (assuming that all missing data represented unsuccessful outcomes) to those not reporting ITT analysis (on-treatment analysis) in a sensitivity analysis to assess the potential impact of missing data on the overall effect of treatment.\n\nWe assessed heterogeneity in two ways. First, we explored the presence of heterogeneity at face value by comparing population groups, interventions or outcomes across studies. In the case of clear face value heterogeneity we reported the outcomes of the studies as in a systematic review but we did not pool the results. If there was no obvious heterogeneity we used statistical tests such as the Cochrane Chi\u00b2 (Q) test and the I\u00b2 statistic to determine the presence and level of statistical heterogeneity for each outcome (Higgins 2003) . We considered an I\u00b2 statistic of 60% or more to represent important heterogeneity. Where possible we explored the causes of statistical heterogeneity using subgroup and sensitivity analyses. We specified a priori that we would not carry out a metaanalysis if heterogeneity was greater than 90% and there was too much variation in the results, particularly inconsistency in the direction of the effect.\n\nWe did not identify more than 10 studies for any of the outcome measures. Therefore, it was not possible to assess reporting bias using funnel plots as described in section 10.4.3 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Sterne 2011).\n\nWe analysed single-dose and multi-dose studies separately as well as combined. Clinically, we expect that a single or multi-dose of nasal decongestant would have a similar effect, although it may not be as long lasting in the case of a single dose. Therefore, we combined measurements of single and multi-dose studies for up to three hours after dosing. We included results from studies that met the inclusion criteria and reported the selected outcomes in the meta-analysis. We calculated the summary weighted OR and 95% CI for dichotomous secondary outcomes using the inverse of the variance of each study result for weighting. We standardised the results of the studies to a uniform scale when looking at continuous outcomes. In this case, we used the SMD to express the size of the intervention effect in each study relative to the variability observed in that study. We planned to calculate the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) for an additional beneficial outcome using the summary OR and the average control event rate described in the relevant studies. However, this was not possible because all studies assessed improvement in nasal congestion on a continuous scale. We performed fixed-effect meta-analyses and random-effects meta-analyses and compared the two models. We reported any differences between the models, but throughout all analyses we used a random-effects model for final reporting.\n\nThere is no defined minimal clinically important difference for measures of subjective improvement in nasal congestion, therefore we used the SMDs as a guide. However, SMDs are difficult to interpret and several options are available for re-expressing SMDs: every method has its benefits and pitfalls. For this review we decided to use rules of thumb for effect sizes as a guide: 0.2 to 0.49 represents a small effect, 0.5 to 0.79 a moderate effect and \u2265 0.8 a large effect, as described in section 12.6.2 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Sterne 2011).\n\nWe created 'Summary of findings' tables using the following outcomes: subjective symptom scores for nasal congestion, overall patient well-being and adverse events. We used the five GRADE considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence as it relates to the studies that contributed data to the meta-analyses for the prespecified outcomes (Atkins 2004). We included the following comparisons: single-dose decongestant versus placebo, multi-dose decongestant versus placebo and all doses versus placebo. We used the methods and recommendations described in Section 8.5 and Chapter 12 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011), using the GRADEproGDT software (GRADEproGDT 2015). We justified all decisions to downgrade or upgrade the quality of studies using footnotes, and we made comments to aid readers' understanding of the review where necessary.\n\nWe decided a priori that, if sufficient data were available, we would conduct the following subgroup analyses to explore differential treatment effects.\n\n\u2022 Children (aged up to 12 years) versus others (aged over 12 years).\n\n\u2022 Topical versus oral nasal decongestants.\n\nWe decided a priori to perform sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of heterogeneity on the overall outcome (pooled estimate) of the meta-analysis. We did this by gradually removing single trials to investigate the extent to which they contributed to heterogeneity. We also used sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of risk of bias on the overall pooled estimate by first pooling the studies with low risk of bias and then gradually adding the studies assessed as having a high risk of bias.\n\nAll results are based on published data only. More information about the studies is presented in Characteristics of included studies, Characteristics of excluded studies, Characteristics of studies awaiting classification and Characteristics of ongoing studies.\n\nWe retrieved 888 records with duplicates removed from the searches of the electronic databases (CENTRAL 285, MED-LINE 364, Embase 427, CINAHL 70, LILACS 3 and Web of Science 216). Based on screening of titles and abstracts, we excluded 847 records; we assessed the full text of the remaining 41 articles for eligibility ( Figure 1 ). We excluded 25 studies based on the full text. Two studies have not yet been classified (NCT00452270; NCT01062360), and two studies are ongoing (EUCTR2006-006690-25-GB; NCT01744106). The reasons for the exclusion of the 25 excluded studies are shown in Characteristics of excluded studies table.\n\nWe included 16 references to 15 RCTs (Eccles 2008 was published as a full paper as well as an abstract). The interventions consisted of single doses (N = 6) (Akerlund 1989; Cohen 1978; Ferguson 1997; Gronborg 1983; Latte 2004; Taverner 1999) , and multiple doses (N = 9) of nasal decongestants (Bye 1980; Eccles 2005; Eccles 2006; Eccles 2008; Eccles 2014; Jawad 1998; Latte 2007; Reinecke 2005; Sperber 1989) . Some interventions included a treatment arm with combination therapy (e.g. pseudoephedrine plus paracetamol). However, in this review we focused on the effectiveness of nasal decongestants only. Therefore, we did not include the treatment arms that considered combination therapy.\n\nThe included trials were randomised and placebo-controlled. With the exception of one (Jawad 1998), all trials were double-blinded. Fourteen of the RCTs were parallel-group studies, and only one cross-over design trial was included (Gronborg 1983).\n\nThe included trials involved 2596 participants, including all treatment groups, as well as those receiving combination therapy. When participants receiving combination therapy or other drugs (e.g. paracetamol only) were excluded, the total number of participants was 1838.\n\nThe studies were conducted in the United States (Cohen 1978; Sperber 1989) 2007; Taverner 1999) . The remaining studies were conducted in a university (Gronborg 1983; Sperber 1989) , or hospital setting (Akerlund 1989; Cohen 1978) . The setting was unclear in two studies (Cohen 1978; Reinecke 2005) .\n\nThe participants of six trials were recruited from the community via poster advertisements (Eccles 2005; Eccles 2006; Gronborg 1983; Jawad 1998; Latte 2007; Taverner 1999) , one of which only advertised in a students' magazine (Gronborg 1983) . Two trials recruited males undergoing military training (Akerlund 1989), and staff from a charity foundation (Bye 1980). Recruitment procedures were unclear in seven trials (Cohen 1978; Eccles 2008; Eccles 2014; Ferguson 1997; Latte 2004; Reinecke 2005; Sperber 1989 ). With one exception, all studies included adult participants only (Reinecke 2005) . The cut-off in 10 studies was 18 years of age (Akerlund 1989; Cohen 1978; Eccles 2005; Eccles 2006; Eccles 2008; Gronborg 1983; Jawad 1998; Latte 2004; Latte 2007; Taverner 1999) ; five studies did not provide an age range (Bye 1980; Cohen 1978; Eccles 2014; Ferguson 1997; Sperber 1989) . In most trials the mean age was under 25 years (Akerlund 1989; Eccles 2005; Ferguson 1997; Gronborg 1983; Jawad 1998; Latte 2004; Sperber 1989) ; mean ages were 26 years and 30 years respectively in Taverner 1999 and Bye 1980. Six trials did not provide the mean age (Cohen 1978; Eccles 2006; Eccles 2008; Eccles 2014; Latte 2007; Reinecke 2005) . Reinecke 2005 was the only study to include younger people (participants had to be older than 12 years; however, the mean age of included participants was not provided.\n\nThirteen studies clearly defined cut-offs for the time since onset of the common cold (Akerlund 1989; Cohen 1978; Eccles 2005; Eccles 2006; Eccles 2008; Eccles 2014; Ferguson 1997; Gronborg 1983; Jawad 1998; Latte 2004; Latte 2007; Reinecke 2005; Taverner 1999 ). Ten studies used cut-off durations of less than three days (Akerlund 1989; Cohen 1978; Eccles 2005; Eccles 2006; Eccles 2008; Eccles 2014; Gronborg 1983; Latte 2004; Latte 2007; Reinecke 2005) ; three studies used cut-offs of less than five days (Ferguson 1997; Jawad 1998; Taverner 1999) . One study counted the total number of colds over the period of a year and did not specify the duration between onset of symptoms and enrolment in the study (Bye 1980) ; another experimentally induced the common cold via intranasal rhinovirus challenge (Sperber 1989) . The duration of follow-up varied from one to 10 days. All six single-dose studies measured the effectiveness of a nasal decongestant on the same day and, thus, had a follow-up of one day (Akerlund 1989; Cohen 1978; Ferguson 1997; Gronborg 1983; Latte 2004; Taverner 1999 \n\nNine trials used pseudoephedrine (Bye 1980; Eccles 2005; Eccles 2006; Eccles 2014; Jawad 1998; Latte 2004; Latte 2007; Sperber 1989; Taverner 1999) , and three investigated oxymetazoline (Akerlund 1989; Ferguson 1997; Reinecke 2005) . Others used xylometazoline (Eccles 2008), phenylpropanolamine (Cohen 1978), or norephedrine (Gronborg 1983). However, in 2000, the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) issued a public health advisory recommending that phenylpropanolamine (also known as norephedrine) should not be considered safe for over-the-counter use and asked the drug manufacturers to voluntarily discontinue marketing products containing phenylpropanolamine (FDA 2000) . As a consequence, phenylpropanolamine is no longer available as a decongestant in most countries. Therefore, we excluded Cohen 1978 and Gronborg 1983 from the meta-analyses.\n\nSeven studies that used pseudoephedrine generally administered multiple doses (Bye 1980; Eccles 2005; Eccles 2006; Eccles 2014; Jawad 1998; Latte 2007; Sperber 1989) , and all used oral tablets, with the exception of Eccles 2014 and Sperber 1989 who used granule sachets and oral capsules respectively. Of the remaining six studies that did not use pseudoephedrine, four used a single dose of medication (Akerlund 1989; Cohen 1978; Ferguson 1997; Gronborg 1983) . Only four studies used a topical decongestant (Akerlund 1989; Eccles 2008; Ferguson 1997; Reinecke 2005) . See Table 1 for an overview.\n\nSeven RCTs reported nasal airway resistance (NAR) as the primary outcome (Akerlund 1989; Cohen 1978; Eccles 2005; Eccles 2008; Gronborg 1983; Latte 2007; Taverner 1999 \n\nWe excluded 25 trials. Ten trials were excluded because the study participants' symptoms of nasal congestion or obstruction were for reasons other than the common cold (e.g. allergic rhinitis) (Akerlund 1989; Ashe 1968; Bailey 1969; Bende 1984; Bende 1985; Castellano 2002; Connell 1969; Pritchard 2014; Tzachev 2002; Zumpft 1975) . We excluded five studies due to lack of randomisation (Anderson 1956; Anonymous 1975; Katrana 1956; McElhenney 1966; Smith 1999) , three due to lack of a placebo control group (Dorn 2003; Fox 1967; Meurman 1975) , and four because only combination therapy was used or reported (Cohen 1977; De Paula Neves 1966; Rumiantsev 1993; Weisberg 1966) . Other reasons included symptom duration of more than six months (Broms 1982), and not measuring any of the predefined outcomes (Hummel 1998; Winther 1983) .\n\nWe identified two ongoing trials. Both are commercially funded, double-blind RCTs involving participants with the common cold and use of nasal decongestants. EUCTR2006-006690-25-GB is a parallel-group study entered into the European clinical trials register in 2007. This study investigates the changes in nasal conductance in participants aged over 18 years with the decongestant xylometazoline. No information on the expected end date of this study was provided. NCT01744106 is a multicentre study that began in November 2012 involving the response of nasal congestion severity in children between the ages of six and 11 years to the decongestant pseudoephedrine. The expected completion date was April 2015, however, this was changed to May 2016.\n\nTwo studies are awaiting classification (NCT00452270; NCT01062360). Both are commercially funded, double-blind RCTs involving the response of nasal congestion in participants aged over 18 years with the common cold to nasal decongestants (xylometazoline and pseudoephedrine). Although both studies were completed before 2011, we were unable to find their published results.\n\nWe assessed all included trials using the six specific domains de-tailed in the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Review of Interventions 'Risk of bias' tool (Higgins 2011). The results of this assessment are shown for each study in Figure 2 and summarised in Figure 3 . Details of the included studies are presented in Characteristics of included studies. Overall, most judgements were unclear due to lack of detail provided in the trials reports. For example, clear and detailed descriptions of the methods of sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding were often missing. Many studies also had pharmaceutical company funding of unknown significance. We deemed only one study to be high risk in any of the six domains (Jawad 1998); this was because the study was not blinded and therefore assessed as high risk in both blinding domains. We assessed seven studies as low risk in this domain, as the authors referenced a randomisation schedule or the method of sequence generation was described in detail (Bye 1980; Cohen 1978; Eccles 2005; Eccles 2006; Latte 2004; Latte 2007; Taverner 1999) . For example, \"Treatment randomisation was from a random numbers table, in blocks of four\" (Latte 2004). We assessed the remaining eight studies as unclear risk for this domain because methods of random sequence generation were not described (Akerlund 1989; Eccles 2008; Eccles 2014; Ferguson 1997; Gronborg 1983; Jawad 1998; Reinecke 2005; Sperber 1989 ).\n\nThe method of allocation concealment was poorly described, or insufficient detail was provided to enable definitive judgement on how concealment was achieved. We assessed five studies to be low risk in the allocation concealment domain (Bye 1980; Cohen 1978; Eccles 2005; Eccles 2014; Latte 2004) . For example, \"it was not possible to distinguish between combination product, monotherapies, and placebo granules\u2026they had the same appearance, taste, and no noticeable smell\" (Eccles 2014). We assessed the remaining 10 studies as unclear risk because none provided the methods of allocation concealment in the text (Akerlund 1989; Eccles 2006; Eccles 2008; Ferguson 1997; Gronborg 1983; Jawad 1998; Latte 2007; Reinecke 2005; Sperber 1989; Taverner 1999) .\n\nWe assessed nine studies to be low risk in this domain as blinding of participants and key study personnel was ensured and it was unlikely that the blinding could have been broken (Bye 1980; Cohen 1978; Eccles 2005; Eccles 2006; Eccles 2008; Eccles 2014; Gronborg 1983; Latte 2004; Taverner 1999) . For example, \"the randomisation code was not broken until all data, including delayed adverse events, had been allocated\" (Taverner 1999). We assessed five studies as unclear risk because insufficient information was provided to permit a judgement of risk (Akerlund 1989; Ferguson 1997; Latte 2007; Reinecke 2005; Sperber 1989) . We assessed the remaining study as high risk because the it was not blinded (Jawad 1998).\n\nWe assessed two studies to be low risk in this domain as both had stated methods of blinding of outcome assessment (Eccles 2014; Gronborg 1983) . We assessed 12 studies as unclear risk, because there was insufficient information on the methods of blinding outcome assessment to permit judgement (Akerlund 1989; Bye 1980; Cohen 1978; Eccles 2005; Eccles 2006; Eccles 2008; Ferguson 1997; Latte 2007; Latte 2004; Reinecke 2005; Sperber 1989; Taverner 1999) . We assessed the remaining study as high risk because it was not blinded (Jawad 1998).\n\nWe assessed 10 studies to be low risk for this domain. All participants, including those who discontinued, were accounted for in the text and the authors clearly indicated the numbers of remaining participants per treatment group (Akerlund 1989; Bye 1980; Cohen 1978; Eccles 2006; Eccles 2008; Ferguson 1997; Gronborg 1983; Latte 2004; Sperber 1989; Taverner 1999) . We assessed five studies as unclear risk (Eccles 2005; Eccles 2014; Jawad 1998; Latte 2007; Reinecke 2005) . Numbers of remaining participants in each treatment group could not be ascertained.\n\nWe assessed 12 studies as low risk for selective reporting; these studies reported all intended outcomes (Akerlund 1989; Cohen 1978; Eccles 2005; Eccles 2006; Eccles 2014; Ferguson 1997; Gronborg 1983; Jawad 1998; Latte 2004; Latte 2007; Sperber 1989; Taverner 1999) . We assessed three studies to be at high risk of selective reporting bias (Bye 1980; Eccles 2008; Reinecke 2005) . Bye 1980 reported only significant results in detail; Eccles 2008 reported NAC rather than NAR (Eccles 2008).\n\nWe assessed four studies to be at low risk of other potential sources of bias; there was no evidence of pharmaceutical company funding or any other sources of bias identified in these studies (Akerlund 1989; Cohen 1978; Jawad 1998; Latte 2004 In some studies a positive score indicated better nasal patency, whereas in other studies a negative score reflected better functioning. We transformed the negative scores (e.g. by multiplying by -1) so that for all comparisons a higher score reflected better functioning and studies could be combined. One study included more than one treatment arm (four different doses of the same nasal decongestant); we combined data from treatment arms that were similar and compared this group to the control group (Akerlund 1989). Heterogeneity was not greater than 90% for any analyses. We tested and reported differences between using fixed-effect and random-effects models, but we applied the random-effects model as the final model for all analyses. The random-effects model generates wider confidence intervals (CIs) than the fixed-effect model (Higgins 2011). We present results for single and multi-dose studies separately as well as all dosages combined for each outcome. We evaluated the effectiveness of a nasal decongestant compared to placebo approximately three hours after the last dose. We chose the timeframe of three hours because clinically we expect that a single or multidose of nasal decongestant would have a similar effect, although it may not be as long lasting in the case of a single dose. Furthermore, most multi-dose studies measured nasal decongestant effectiveness approximately three hours after the last dose. We discuss the results for this comparison only where both single and multidose studies were available for the same outcome. Otherwise, we refer to the results for single or multi-dose comparisons separately. Furthermore, some multi-dose studies also reported outcomes after a single dose. In this comparison only the results after multiple doses are included otherwise the study would be counted twice.\n\nIf possible, we also present results for studies that used an oral or topical decongestant separately and combined.\n\nSix trials were single-dose studies (Akerlund 1989; Cohen 1978; Ferguson 1997; Gronborg 1983; Latte 2004; Taverner 1999) , two used a topical decongestant (Akerlund 1989; Ferguson 1997) , and four used an oral decongestant (Cohen 1978; Gronborg 1983; Latte 2004; Taverner 1999 \n\nTwo studies assessed the effectiveness of treatment after 30 minutes (Cohen 1978; Taverner 1999) . Both studies used an oral decongestant. We were unable to pool results because Cohen 1978 was excluded from all meta-analyses. Only for Cohen 1978 was the estimated SMD between treatment and placebo statistically significant and in favour of the treatment group (SMD 0.88, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.53; 40 participants; Cohen 1978, oral decongestant) (SMD 0.46, 95% CI -0.09 to 1.01; 52 participants; Taverner 1999, oral decongestant). SMDs corresponded to a large and small effect respectively.\n\nThree studies measured the effectiveness of a nasal decongestant subjectively one hour after dosing (Akerlund 1989; Cohen 1978; Taverner 1999 \n\nThree studies reported the effectiveness of a nasal decongestant compared to placebo two hours after treatment (Cohen 1978; Latte 2004; Taverner 1999 \n\nAkerlund 1989 and Cohen 1978 also reported on the effectiveness of a nasal decongestant compared to placebo four hours after dosing. Akerlund 1989 used a topical decongestant and Cohen 1978 used an oral decongestant. We were unable to pool results because we excluded Cohen 1978 from all meta-analyses and both studies reported different outcome measures (mean and mean difference (MD)). Neither Akerlund 1989 (SMD 0.31, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.79; 106 participants; topical decongestant), nor Cohen 1978 (SMD 0.40, 95% CI -0.23 to 1.02; 40 participants; oral decongestant) showed a statistically significant difference between the treatment and placebo groups. Furthermore, for both studies the SMD corresponded to a small clinical effect.\n\nAkerlund 1989, who used a topical decongestant, also reported on the effectiveness of a single dose of a nasal decongestant seven hours after dosing. The difference between treatment and placebo group participants was not statistically significant (SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.37 to 0.58; 106 participants; Akerlund 1989, topical decongestant). Gronborg 1983 is a single-dose study that used an oral decongestant. Gronborg 1983 used a cross-over design and, therefore, these results were not included in the meta-analyses. Gronborg 1983 reported that during the two to 10 hours observation period after dosing the mean score for subjective nasal congestion was better for the treatment group compared to placebo (P < 0.01; 30 participants).\n\nResults reported by Ferguson 1997 (oral decongestant) were not included in the meta-analyses because insufficient details were provided to standardise the results, and it was not clear when NAR was measured. Ferguson 1997 reported that the NAR was improved in the treatment group (P < 0.0001) but not in the control group (P = 0.98). This study was based on 82 participants. We were able to pool results for Eccles 2008 and Sperber 1989 (topical and oral decongestant respectively). These studies provided a mean score for subjective nasal congestion and the pooled SMD was statistically significant and in favour of the treatment group (SMD 0.49, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.92; 94 participants; two studies; Analysis 1.1). However, a SMD of 0.49 corresponds to a small clinical effect.\n\nThe difference between studies that used oral or topical decongestants was not significant (P = 0.49). There was no major statistical heterogeneity as confirmed by an I\u00b2 statistic of 0%. Nevertheless, we used a random-effects model and this did not change our results. We judged the level of evidence to be of low quality because the pooled result was based on only two studies (imprecision) and there was possible risk of bias due to unclear reporting.\n\nSperber 1989 was the only study that reported a mean score and Latte 2007 was the only study that reported the MD. Therefore we were unable to pool these results. In both studies, the difference between subjective congestion in the treatment versus placebo groups was not statistically significant (SMD 0.28, 95% CI -0.47 to 1.02; 33 participants; Sperber 1989, oral decongestant) (SMD 0.15, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.42; 212 participants; Latte 2007, oral decongestant). Bye 1980 and Eccles 2005 were not included in the meta-analyses because insufficient details were provided to standardise results. Bye 1980 (140 participants) reported that there was a statistically significant improvement for subjective nasal congestion in the treatment group at the end of day one. However, no results for subjective nasal congestion were provided on days two and three and it was unclear if subjective nasal congestion in the treatment group was compared to the control group. Eccles 2005 (238 participants) reported no statistically significant difference between treatment and placebo for the AUC of the VAS between 0 and 3 hours (P = 0.79) and between 0 and 4 hours (P = 0.75) after the last dose. Only over the three-day period was there a statistically significant improvement for the mean difference in nasal congestion score for treatment compared to placebo.\n\nOnly Eccles 2008 used a topical decongestant. In this study the difference between treatment and placebo was statistically significant and the SMD of 0.59 corresponded to a moderate clinical effect (SMD 0.59, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.11; 61 participants; Eccles 2008, topical decongestant). These three studies reported a decline in the mean subjective symptom score for nasal congestion, and the pooled effect was statistically significant (SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.78; 146 participants; three studies; Analysis 2.1). However, a SMD of 0.44 corresponds to a small effect. Only Eccles 2008 used a topical decongestant; Sperber 1989 and Taverner 1999 used oral decongestants. The difference between studies that used oral or topical decongestants was not significant (P = 0.49). There was no major statistical heterogeneity as confirmed by an I\u00b2 statistic of 0%. As such, using a random-effects model did not change our results. We judged the evidence to be of moderate quality due to possible risk of bias.\n\nWhen only studies that used an oral decongestant were considered (Sperber 1989; Taverner 1999) , the difference between treatment and placebo was no longer statistically significant (SMD 0.33, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.77; 85 participants; two studies; Analysis 2.1). Latte 2004 and Latte 2007 reported the AUC for subjective nasal congestion; the pooled effect was very small and not statistically significant (SMD 0.11, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.35; 260 participants; two studies; Analysis 2.1). There was no major statistical heterogeneity as confirmed by an I\u00b2 statistic of 0% for both the mean nasal congestion and the AUC. Using a random-effects model did not change our results. We judged the evidence to be of low quality because of possible risk of bias due to unclear reporting and imprecision.\n\nNone of the studies included in the meta-analyses for the primary outcome measure reported intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses (Eccles 2008; Latte 2004; Latte 2007; Sperber 1989; Taverner 1999) . Only in Eccles 2008 was the mean subjective score for nasal congestion significantly better for the treatment group compared to placebo. Eccles 2008 randomised 61 participants but five people were not dosed or analysed; reasons for exclusion were not provided. In the other studies, participants were excluded from analysis because they were unable to perform the rhinomanometry (Latte 2004), had incomplete data (Latte 2007), were infected with a wild type rhinovirus, withdrew for personal reasons (Sperber 1989), or were unable to complete the study (Taverner 1999).\n\nOnly Eccles 2008 used a topical decongestant. The difference between treatment and placebo was statistically significant and the SMD of 0.59 corresponded to a moderate clinical effect (SMD 0.59, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.11; 61 participants).\n\nThe included trials did not report this outcome.\n\nObjective measures of NAR were tested between 15 minutes and 10 hours after dosing. Similar to subjective measures of NAR, we were unable to pool results. Therefore, we report results for all time points in more detail for each study.\n\nOnly Cohen 1978 objectively measured the immediate effect of a nasal decongestant versus placebo 15 minutes after administration. This was assessed by the mean difference in NAR. The estimated SMD was small and the difference between the treatment and placebo groups was not statistically significant (SMD 0.42, 95% CI -0.21 to 1.04; 40 participants). This study used an oral decongestant.\n\nTwo studies objectively assessed the effectiveness of oral decongestant treatment after 30 minutes (Cohen 1978; Taverner 1999) . In both studies, the estimated SMD between treatment and placebo groups was not statistically significant (SMD 0.21 95% CI -0.41 to 0.83; 40 participants; Cohen 1978), (SMD 0.08 95% CI -0.49 to 0.64; 48 participants; Taverner 1999).\n\nFive studies objectively measured the effectiveness of a nasal decongestant one hour after dosing (Akerlund 1989; Cohen 1978; Eccles 2006; Eccles 2008; Taverner 1999 \n\nThree studies reported the effectiveness of oral nasal decongestant compared to placebo two hours after treatment (Cohen 1978; Latte 2004; Taverner 1999 \n\nFour studies reported on the effectiveness of a nasal decongestant compared to placebo three hours after dosing (Akerlund 1989; Cohen 1978; Latte 2007; Taverner 1999 CI -0.06 to 0.45; 236 participants) did not report a statistically significant difference between the treatment and placebo group.\n\nOnly Akerlund 1989 reported the effectiveness of a single dose of a nasal decongestant up to seven hours after dosing. This study used a topical decongestant and showed a small difference between treatment and placebo that was not statistically significant (SMD 0.36, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.86; 102 participants). Gronborg 1983, a single-dose oral decongestant study that used a cross-over design, involved 30 participants. It was not included in the meta-analyses. Gronborg 1983 found that NAR worsened in the placebo group whereas it improved in the treatment group; this difference was statistically significant (P < 0.02).\n\nFour multi-dose studies reported objective measurements of nasal congestion ( \n\nIn Eccles 2005 (SMD 0.11, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.37; 230 participants), Jawad 1998 (SMD 0.23, 95% CI -0.39 to 0.86; 40 participants) and Latte 2007 (SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.37; 212 participants) the effect of multiple doses of oral decongestants on objective measurements of nasal congestion was not statistically significant.\n\nOf the four studies that reported objective measurements of nasal congestion, Eccles 2008 was the only study that used a topical decongestant and showed a statistically significant effect of multiple doses of nasal decongestant on objective measurements of nasal congestion: in this study expressed as the least square mean of NAC (SMD 0.89, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.41; 61 participants). The SMD of 0.89 corresponded to a significant clinical effect.\n\nIn total, four single-dose (Akerlund 1989; Cohen 1978; Latte 2004; Taverner 1999) \n\nTwo single-dose trials reported adverse events (Gronborg 1983; Taverner 1999) ; both used an oral decongestant. Taverner 1999 reported no adverse events in either the treatment or the placebo group. Results from Gronborg 1983 were not included in the meta-analysis because this study used a cross-over study design and several events per patient were reported. Overall, 32 and 21 events were reported in the treatment and placebo groups respectively; this was not statistically significant. all studies reported specific adverse events. However, the adverse events differed among studies and ranged from vomiting and dry mouth, to lethargy, dizziness, pain and mouth ulcers. In Latte 2007, adverse events were not clearly described in the original paper, but these were included in the Cochrane Review by the same authors (Taverner 2007); therefore, we used these numbers in our review as well.\n\nWe only reported the specific type of adverse event if this was reported by more than one study.\n\nSeven studies reported the total number of participants with adverse events (Bye 1980; Eccles 2005; Eccles 2006; Eccles 2008; Eccles 2014; Latte 2007; Sperber 1989) . In both treatment and placebo arms, 13% of participants reported an adverse event. The chance of having an adverse event was slightly lower for treatment group participants. However, the difference with the placebo was not statistically significant (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.40; 1195 participants; seven studies; Analysis 1.2).\n\nThe difference between studies that used an oral or topical decongestant was not significant (P = 0.68).\n\nFor the pooled effect of all adverse events there was no clear heterogeneity given the I\u00b2 statistic of 0%. We used a random-effects model throughout all analyses for adverse events and this did not change the interpretation of the results. We judged the evidence for all adverse events to be of low quality because of possible risk of bias due to unclear reporting and lack of precision (wide confidence interval). The difference between studies that used an oral or topical decongestant was not significant (P = 0.14). There seemed to be moderate heterogeneity given the I\u00b2 statistic of 34%. We used a random-effects model and this did not change the interpretation or the results.\n\nSix studies that used an oral decongestant reported total numbers of participants with adverse events ( For the pooled effect of all adverse events there was no clear heterogeneity given the I\u00b2 statistic of 0%. We used a random-effects model for all analyses of adverse events; this did not change the interpretation or the results. We judged the evidence for all adverse events to be of moderate quality because of possible risk of bias due to unclear reporting. There was no clear heterogeneity given the I\u00b2 statistic of 0%. We used a random-effects model and this did not change the interpretation or the results.\n\nOnly Eccles 2008 used a topical decongestant and reported adverse events. In this study the difference between treatment and placebo was not statistically significant (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.39 to 3.88; 61 participants).\n\nNone of the studies that used a topical decongestant reported insomnia or difficulty sleeping.\n\nOnly Eccles 2008 used a topical decongestant and reported headache as an adverse event. In this study the difference between treatment and placebo groups was not statistically significant (OR 4.00, 95% CI 0.42 to 38.07; 61 participants).\n\nTwo single-dose studies reported adverse events associated with oral decongestants (Gronborg 1983; Taverner 1999) . Taverner 1999 reported no events and Gronborg 1983 was excluded from meta-analyses because it was a cross-over study. Therefore, combining single-dose and multi-dose studies resulted in the same results for multi-dose adverse events (Analysis 1.2).\n\nNone of the included studies reported this outcome.\n\nThe included single-dose trials did not report this outcome.\n\nOnly one multi-dose study reported the time to full recovery ( Reinecke 2005, 247 participants). Reinecke 2005 used a topical decongestant and showed that the mean time until full recovery was better for the treatment group (four days) compared to the placebo group (six days; P = 0.001).\n\nThe included trials did not report this outcome.\n\nWe planned to compare studies in children aged up to 12 years compared with those aged over 12 years. However, none of the single-dose studies included children so we were unable to perform this subgroup analysis.\n\nThe other subgroup analysis, as specified a priori, was to compare oral versus nasal decongestants. Since we were unable to pool studies we could not perform this subgroup analysis. However, for each comparison in this review we report whether an oral or topical decongestant was used.\n\nWe planned to compare studies in children aged up to 12 years compared with those aged over 12 years. However, none of the multi-dose studies included children. Reinecke 2005 included people aged 12 years and above so excluded children.\n\nFor the multi-dose studies, we were only able to pool results for the primary outcome, subjective symptom scores for nasal congestion (three studies), and adverse events (seven studies). Therefore, assessing the difference between oral versus topical nasal decongestants on subjective symptom scores for nasal congestion involved two studies that used an oral decongestant (Sperber 1989; Taverner 1999) , and one that used a topical decongestant (Eccles 2008).\n\nThe difference between studies that used an oral decongestant and the study that used a topical decongestant was not statistically significant (P = 0.45). Also for adverse events, there was only one study that used a topical decongestant (Eccles 2008); all others used an oral decongestant (Bye 1980; Eccles 2005; Eccles 2006; Eccles 2014; Latte 2007; Sperber 1989) . The difference between the pooled result for the oral decongestant versus the only study on the topical decongestant was not statistically significant (P = 0.68).\n\nWe planned to compare studies in children aged up to 12 years compared with those aged over 12 years. However, none of the studies included children.\n\nWe were able to assess the impact of oral versus topical decongestants only for outcomes where we could pool results and there were both single and multi-dose studies available. This was only possible for the primary outcome, subjective symptom scores, and the secondary outcome, objective measures of NAR. For the primary outcome of subjective symptom scores, three studies reported the mean score (Eccles 2008; Sperber 1989; Taverner 1999) , and two studies reported an AUC (Latte 2004; Latte 2007). Since pooling of these two outcome measures was not appropriate we discuss both separately. For studies that reported the mean subjective symptom score, we compared the pooled effect of the two studies that used an oral decongestant (Sperber 1989; Taverner 1999) with the results of one study that used a topical decongestant (Eccles 2008). The difference between the two was not statistically significant (P = 0.45). For the two studies that used AUC as an outcome we were unable to assess differences between oral and topical decongestants because both used an oral decongestant. between oral and topical decongestants was statistically significant (P = 0.03). However, each subgroup only included one study. As for multi-dose decongestants we indicated if results were based on studies using an oral or topical decongestant. These results are reported in more detail above.\n\nShould multiple doses of decongestant in monotherapy be used for the common cold in adults? Prim ary outcom e: subjective sym ptom score (AUC) -3 hours af ter dosing Oral\n\nThe unstandardised m ean AUC f or the subjective sym ptom score ranged f rom 22 to -77. 45 Subjective nasal congestion was 0.11 standard units better in the treatm ent group (95% CI -0.14 to 0.35; P value 0.39) \n\nWe compared the effectiveness of nasal decongestants administered as single and multiple doses to treat nasal congestion in people with the common cold. We included 15 trials and analyses were based on a total of 1838 participants. Nine studies used pseudoephedrine and three used oxymetazoline. Other decongestants included phenylpropanolamine, norephedrine and xylometazoline. The studies that used phenylpropanolamine or norephedrine were excluded from meta-analyses because this drug is no longer available in most countries (FDA 2000) . There were large differences in reported outcomes. Reporting of study methods was limited in most studies. Therefore, pooling was only possible for a few studies. All studies, except one, included adult participants only (aged 18 years and over). Reinecke 2005 included younger people (aged up to 12 years) but did not provide details on the mean age of participants. As such, the results of this review are applicable to adults only. We were unable to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of singledose decongestants because pooling was not possible due to the large diversity in measuring and reporting symptoms of congestion. For other outcome measures, such as overall patient wellbeing and time to recovery, either no data or insufficient data were available. For multiple doses of decongestant, meta-analysis was possible for subjective measures of congestion only (measured approximately three hours after the last dose). Subjective measures of congestion were significantly better for treatment group participants compared to placebo group participants. However, the clinical effect was small, and this result was based on two studies only (one topical and one oral decongestant) and involved a total of 88 participants. Hence, for multiple doses of a nasal decongestant it seems that there is a small beneficial effect on nasal congestion when measured subjectively. Although subjective measures of nasal congestion are probably the most relevant outcomes, since nasal decongestants are used for symptomatic relief only, it is not clear if this small effect is clinically relevant and sufficient to justify widespread use of decongestants (Taverner 2007). There were insufficient data to estimate differences in the efficacy of oral versus topical decongestants. Adverse events were reported in nine studies and the risk of adverse events in treatment group participants was not significantly different from people in the placebo group. It seems that short-term use of nasal decongestants in adults with the common cold can be considered safe.\n\nWe recognise that there were few included studies. In addition, because these studies were very heterogeneous in their approach to outcome measures, the number of studies that could be pooled for each outcome was even smaller, with most subgroup analyses only containing two studies. Hence, the generalisability of our results is very limited. With respect to adverse events it was surprising to note that none of the included multi-dose studies investigated the problem of tachyphylaxis or rhinitis medicamentosa. This could be due to the limited follow-up in most studies (between one and 10 days). Furthermore, the side effects profile of oral versus topical decongestants might differ; one might expect more systemic and delayed side effects with oral preparations. We were unable to assess this aspect because only one study that used a topical decongestant reported adverse effects. Twelve studies used subjective measures as outcomes, which are probably the most relevant outcomes to clinical applicability, because nasal decongestants are used for symptomatic relief. In addition, all studies, except one, included participants with community-acquired common cold. The results are only applicable to an adult population because none of the studies included children aged 12 years or younger. Another concern about the applicability of the current evidence relates to the use of pseudoephedrine. Nine studies tested the effectiveness of pseudoephedrine; however, this has not been available since 2005 as an over-the-counter decongestant because it can be used to make methamphetamine (FDA 2005) . Currently, pseudoephedrine is being replaced by phenylephrine as a way to control methamphetamine abuse. Despite phenylephrine being a common decongestant that is available over-the-counter, none of the studies in this review evaluated its effectiveness.\n\nFor most outcomes we downgraded the quality of evidence to moderate or low due to the limited data available or poor 'Risk of bias' assessments. We included 15 studies, with a total of 1838 participants, but pooling was often not possible. When pooling was possible, results were often only based on two studies. All studies except one included adult participants and so the findings of our review cannot be generalised to children. We recognise that over half of the included studies were published before 2000, and that many of the studies do not provide sufficient methodological information to exclude risk of bias. Hence, for most studies, risk of bias is unclear.\n\nGiven the small number of included studies, it is possible that we did not find all relevant trials. Hence, publication bias cannot be definitively ruled out, which may lead to overestimation of the treatment effect. For example, we found four studies that were relevant for this review, but no results were available. Two are completed trials with no published results (NCT00452270; NCT01062360), and a third, although originally registered in 2007, is stated to be ongoing (EUCTR2006-006690-25-GB). The fourth study is also ongoing; it started in 2012, but the estimated completion date recently changed from April 2015 to May 2016 (NCT01744106). This review was conducted as outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011). We searched several databases and three authors (LD, LG, NM) independently selected studies and extracted data, thus minimising the risk of introducing bias during the review process.\n\nOur results are in line with those of other systematic reviews and meta-analyses. In a similar, but older, Cochrane Review on nasal decongestants for the common cold, Taverner 2007 concluded that nasal decongestants are modestly effective for the short-term relief of congestion in adults. Two hours after dosing, a significant decrease in patient-reported symptoms for treatment versus placebo was described. Similar to our findings, the effects were small and although statistically significant, it is not clear if the reduction in symptoms is clinically relevant and sufficient to justify widespread use of decongestants (Taverner 2007) . Several other reviews on nasal decongestants for the common cold have also been published (e.g. Allan 2014; Arroll 2005; Arroll 2011; Meltzer 2010). Generally, their conclusions were based on the Cochrane Reviews Taverner 2004 and Taverner 2007, or more recent studies that were included in this review. Accordingly, the results and conclusions are similar and in line with this review. Kollar 2007 investigated the effectiveness of a single 10 mg dose of phenylephrine compared to placebo. Kollar 2007 showed that a single oral dose of phenylephrine significantly improved acute nasal congestion. However, it must be noted that the meta-analyses in this review were almost completely based on small unpublished studies conducted between 1968 and 1975, which were included in a monograph by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). According to Eccles 2007, the studies included in the FDA report were in-house studies provided by representatives of pharmaceutical companies (Eccles 2007). Another review on xylometazoline (alone and in combination) concluded that xylometazoline provides fast and effective relief from nasal congestion (Eccles 2010). However, this review included only four studies and did not include a meta-analysis. We included only one study that used xylometazoline (Eccles 2008). Hence, we were unable to formulate firm conclusions about the effectiveness of this medication. Furthermore, it was beyond the scope of our review to evaluate the effectiveness of different nasal decongestants individually.\n\nThe Cochrane Review on combination drugs for the common cold (oral antihistamine-decongestant-analgesic combinations) found that the effect on individual symptoms is small, \"probably too small to be clinically relevant\" (De Sutter 2012). The lack of evidence in children was also confirmed by other studies on decongestants alone and combination products (Allan 2014; Arroll 2005; De Sutter 2012). In terms of the risk of side effects our results were in agreement with other reviews and studies; the incidence of side effects with shortterm use of decongestants is low and side effects are mostly mild to moderate (e.g. insomnia and headache) (Allan 2014; Eccles 2010; Taverner 2007). Although we did not identify data on the safety of nasal decongestants in children, there are reports of adverse events after single use of nasal decongestant. For example, the FDA published a warning in 2012 about serious adverse events after ingestion of over-the-counter nasal sprays containing oxymetazoline by children under the age of six years (FDA 2012).\n\nThe effectiveness of nasal decongestants in monotherapy is uncertain. There may be a small benefit on the subjective experience of nasal congestion after multiple doses of a nasal decongestant (low-quality evidence). However, it is unclear if the small effect is clinically relevant. Due to the small number of studies that used a topical nasal decongestant, we were unable to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of oral versus topical decongestants. The incidence of mostly mild-to-moderate side effects was low. These results are applicable to adults only. Despite common colds being equally common in children, there is no evidence available on either effectiveness or safety in children.\n\nGiven the high consumption of nasal decongestants it was surprising that so little evidence is available. Questions about the effectiveness and safety in children remain unanswered. However, given the reports of serious adverse events in young children, further research in this group does not appear to be warranted or feasible (FDA 2012) . Some questions regarding the effectiveness and safety of nasal decongestants in adults also remain unanswered. More research is need to investigate the long-term effects of multiple doses of nasal decongestants on tachyphylaxis or rhinitis medicamentosa and the differences between oral and topical decongestants need to be explored.\n\nWe were unable to compare the effectiveness of different decongestants. For example, pseudoephedrine is often replaced by phenylephrine as a way to control methamphetamine abuse. However, as a decongestant, phenylephrine may not be as effective (Eccles 2007) . Despite phenylephrine being a common decongestant that is available over-the-counter, none of the included studies evaluated its effectiveness. Hence, more large-scale, good-quality randomised controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of several nasal decongestants are needed.\n\nFurthermore, future research should seek to define a minimal clinically important difference for measures of subjective improvement in nasal congestion. As this was not available, we used a statistical approach to interpret our results. For example, a we regarded a standardised mean difference between 0.2 and 0.49 as a small effect. However, it remains unclear how this small statistical effect corresponds to clinical effect.\n\nWe wish to thank Sarah Thorning for her assistance with the searches and Liz Dooley for her support with the review process.

If the treatment arm was similar (e.g. different doses of the same nasal decongestant), we combined data from these treatment arms and compared this group to the control group, as recommended in section 7.7.3.8 and Table 7 .7a of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011).\n\nWe added randomised cross-over trials to the inclusion criteria because cross-over studies with adequate randomisation can be regarded as RCTs. We also specified how we handled data from trials using cross-over designs; results of these studies were not included in the meta-analysis, but were reported narratively.\n\nIn Methods, Data collection and analysis and Data synthesis we specified the rule-of-thumb for effect sizes to facilitate interpretation of the SMD as described in section 12.6.2 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011). In the same section, we also added a description of how we assessed the overall quality of the evidence. We used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach, which gives an indication of the confidence that can be placed in the estimate of treatment effect. The effect estimates and GRADE ratings were summarised in the 'Summary of findings' tables. We only summarised results for which more than one study was available. We used the GRADEprofiler tool (GRADEpro) and followed the advice from the GRADE Handbook (Sch\u00fcnemann 2009).\n\nWe also analysed single and multi-dose studies together, whereas in the protocol it was stated that we would analyse them separately (Ta'i 2012). Clinically it could be argued that a single or multiple-dose nasal decongestant would have a similar effect, although it may not be as long lasting from a single dose. We expect that up to three hours after dosing, the effect of a single dose is clinically not expected to be inferior to multiple doses. Therefore we combined single and multiple doses up to three hours after dosing.\n\nBased on feedback from the statistical editor we decided to use a random-effects model for all meta-analyses. Nevertheless, we reported whether using a fixed-effect or random-effects model affected the results (see Methods; Data collection and analysis; Data synthesis)."}
