{"title": "A qualitative study of zoonotic risk factors among rural communities in southern China", "body": "Emerging and re-emerging zoonotic diseases are key contributors to morbidity and mortality in southern China.1,2 This region, considered a \u2018hotspot\u2019 for emerging zoonotic diseases, harbours abundant wildlife while also undergoing land use change and natural resource overexploitation leading to intensified human\u2013animal interactions that favour the emergence of zoonotic diseases.3 People living in the rural areas of southern China primarily cultivate rice and fruits, raise swine and poultry in households or on small farms,4 but also traditionally hunt wild animals as an alternative income source.5 The mixed landscape has abundant crops, which attracts wild animals into the communities, and livestock rearing is common.6 This brings humans and animals into close contact in dense populations, creating a wildlife\u2013livestock\u2013human interface for zoonotic disease emergence.7\n\nIn recognition of the challenges of emerging infectious diseases after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002 caused by a bat-origin coronavirus, the Chinese government established a national real-time hospital-based infectious disease reporting system.1 Likewise, live poultry market interventions were initiated in response to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in southern China in 2001.8 In December 2019 (after the completion of the current study), a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly across China and the world.9,10 This virus is a group 2b coronavirus, which includes SARS-CoV and bat SARSr-CoVs, and its closest relative is a virus identified in a Rhinolophus affinis bat from Yunnan.10,11 Environmental samples positive for 2019-nCoV were found in an urban market in Wuhan where some of the earliest known human cases originated.12,13 This likely index site sold predominantly seafood, but is also thought to sell live wildlife at the market, and a temporary ban on the wildlife trade for food has been put in place across China. These efforts in response to SARS, HPAI and 2019-nCoV represent a reaction-driven response to zoonotic disease outbreaks, whereas, apart from the new temporary ban on wildlife trade, only limited preventative measures are currently being enacted in the region to reduce the risk of future zoonotic disease outbreaks.14\n\nHowever, detailed knowledge of the social and ecological mechanisms of zoonotic disease emergence in the region is limited, and therefore cannot yet inform evidence-based policies and practices for targeted surveillance programmes.15 Using a qualitative approach through ethnographic interviews and field observations, this study aimed to understand interactions among humans, animals and ecosystems, to shed light on the zoonotic risks in these presumed high-risk communities and to develop an evidence base for identifying appropriate strategies for zoonotic risk mitigation.\n\nThe Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces in southern China were selected for this study because of their historical importance in the origin of emerging infectious diseases,16 diverse wildlife population within protected forests17 and intensive wildlife farming and trade activities.18 Three sites in rural areas were identified in each province where our previous research had found numerous bat and rodent populations harbouring viruses with pathogenic potential for humans, at sites close to human communities.19\u201321\n\nEnrolment criteria for participation in an ethnographic interview in this study included: individuals were residents of the target community, aged \u226518 y, with prior contact with live animals directly (e.g. by raising, hunting, trading or slaughtering live animals) or indirectly (e.g. through animals living in or entering dwellings/crops, bat roosts within roofs, animals invading stored food or crops). We targeted a gender breakdown of 35% of participants being female and aimed to have a diverse sample of participants from different age groups and levels of power and influence in the community.\n\nIn each province, project investigators provided a two-day training workshop for study staff from local provincial and city-level Centres for Disease Control and Prevention who spoke the local language and were familiar with the local community. This included a unit on the ethical conduct of human subject research, an in-depth review of the study design and objectives, and comprehensive information on the implementation of observational research, semistructured interviews and notetaking within the context of this study.\n\nParticipants were identified through key informants and the snowball sampling method because the population size at selected sites and the people who had high-risk contacts with live animals were difficult to elucidate.22 Starting with the key informants, we asked each participant to suggest people who met the inclusion criteria and who might be interested in participating in this study; we then contacted the referrals for potential participation in our study. Local study staff visited potential participants and provided these individuals with the participant information sheet to introduce them to the study. We aimed to obtain a minimum sample size of 20 participants from each of the three provinces, for a total sample size of over 60 participants. At least two field observations of local markets and household environments were conducted at each study site, for a total of 18 observations at a minimum.\n\nParticipation in the study was strictly voluntary. Study staff reviewed the information sheet with potential participants and explained the details of the study. This included the voluntary nature of participation, inclusion and exclusion criteria, study implementation processes (e.g. that the interview would be audio-recorded), potential risks and benefits of participation, results sharing and that they could withdraw their participation at any time. It was also explained that an item as a token would be given as appreciation for their participation, which was identified by the study team and appropriate for the context of the study sites.\n\nAfter completion of the informed consent process, one-on-one semistructured interviews were conducted focusing on the five core themes outlined in the interview guide related to zoonotic disease emergence: human movement, socioeconomics, biosecurity in human environments, human\u2013animal contact and illness, and medical care/treatment and death (Supplementary Data I). All interviews were conducted in the local language and audio-recorded without any identifying information. Confidentiality was maintained by conducting the interviews in a private and secure environment. At the end of the interview, each study participant received a bottle of cooking oil or laundry detergent valued at no more than US$10 as a token of appreciation.\n\nField observations were conducted by study staff at each study site concurrently. Observations were general and implemented in three settings: (1) local markets where live animals were traded, (2) in and/or around the dwellings of study participants and, if applicable, (3) community centres, to obtain an overview of the study site and the communities, and supplementary data on human-animal interactions and environmental biosecurity. The observed information was narrated by study staff and audio-recorded on site.23\n\nTo enhance saturation, efforts were made to include a large variety of people with different backgrounds, to conduct a maximized number of interviews during the 8 wk study period in each province and to cover as many themes and subthemes from the interview guide as possible in each interview.24 All data generated, including notes, audio files, digital transcripts and the interviewer checklist, were coded with an alphanumeric ID to preserve the confidentiality of participants. Paper files were scanned electronically and then shredded. All electronic data were encrypted and password-protected, and access was limited to the study staff conducting analyses.\n\nAll interviews and observations were transcribed from the local language into Mandarin and translated into English. All transcripts were imported into MAXQDA release 12 statistical software (VERBI Software, Berlin, Germany) for data management and analysis. The analysis process incorporated both deductive and inductive approaches, and followed a process of initial coding, identification of new themes, primary coding and identification and analysis of emerging themes.25 An initial codebook associated with the five core themes of the interview guide was developed a priori. After a close reading of the transcripts, two authors used the initial codebook to independently code two transcripts in their entirety, making notes on emerging themes and specified subthemes. Subsequently, the two authors adapted the codebook and used the modified codebook to code all of the transcripts. During the coding process, the two authors met when any major new themes or concepts emerged to decide on any necessary revisions to the codebook, until no new themes emerged and no new information was obtained from the coding. The final codebook was restructured with five sections: (1) demographics, (2) biosecurity in human environments, (3) human\u2013animal contact, (4) illness, treatment and death and (5) animal taxa; subthemes were defined under each section.\n\nAfter completion of the coding, a code report was generated from MAXQDA. Internal reliability was assessed by comparing the coded segments from two authors on the same two transcripts to reach a minimum code interaction rate of 80%.26 A saturation grid was built using the \u2018Segment Retrieval\u2019 function in MAXQDA to ensure saturation was reached.27 Coded segments were categorized into protective factors and risk factors based on their known associations with disease transmission, and the analysis was stratified at the individual, community and policy or regulation level.28 At the individual level, both risk and protective factors were analysed in terms of the individuals' knowledge, attitudes and practices to better understand the risk factors for identifying context-based strategies.29 (Figure 1).\n\nThe majority of study participants were males (n=58, 68%), local residents aged 31\u201350 y (n=55, 63%) and making a living in grain and cash crop production. Small business (n=16, 18%), household livestock production (n=13, 15%) and other migrant and casual work (n=30, 34%) were the other main contributors to local incomes, and many participants reported multiple income sources (n=35, 40%). Without sharing detailed income or education information, participants who discussed socioeconomic status generally indicated low levels of education (e.g. \u2018I didn't go to school that much\u2019) or a low economic status (e.g. \u2018We are poor\u2019) (Table 1).\n\nMost participants reported contact with domestic animals in their daily routine of animal raising, slaughtering and meat preparation for consumption, including cats, dogs, poultry, pigs, cattle and goats. The migrant work of some participants limited the amount of time individuals had for household level animal husbandry, leading to reduced household animal raising. However, many participants kept dogs or cats for companionship, home protection or preventing rat infestations. Poultry, pigs and cattle were commonly raised for meat consumption and the animal waste was further used as crop fertilizer. Few participants took protective measures when handling or slaughtering domestic animals, or sought medical treatment from a nearby clinic after getting bitten or scratched. Vaccinating domestic animals was not widely implemented among study participants. Sick and dead animals were usually buried, but some participants discussed consuming sick animals or feeding the carcasses to other domestic animals.\n\nOn the whole, many participants reported that wild animal hunting, trading or consumption activities have decreased in recent years; however, local communities were still reporting hunting or consumption of some wild animals (e.g. rodents, bats, civets, frogs, snakes and birds) for recreation or additional income. Some participants indicated a preference for wild over domestic animals for consumption; many also held a belief in the purported curative power of wild animals or their by-products. Most participants were fully informed about rabies and the link to dog bites, as well as the postexposure treatment; however, few were aware of other zoonotic diseases and their origin in animals (Box 1).\n\nRecent infrastructural development promoted by local governments was observed and reported around all study sites. Participants reported that this has contributed to improved hygiene and sanitation conditions in local communities. Local wet markets provided safe pork, the most consumed meat among study communities, which had undergone inspection from designated slaughtering houses. However, some participants were concerned about sanitation in local markets, particularly in areas where live poultry were sold and slaughtered. Sterilized tap water was reported to be available in local communities, but anxiety was expressed by some participants regarding water sources shared with animals or polluted by animal waste.\n\nSome participants raised concerns about the environment around their households. In addition to wild animals (e.g. rats, bats and birds) observed entering or living inside human dwellings and contaminating stored food, bat caves or roosts were reported in the community close to human dwellings. Wild animals (e.g. bats, wild boars and deer) were also observed in croplands or orchards eating crops or fruits. Some participants reported that rearing domestic animals as free-range allowed interactions between domestic and wild animals (e.g. wild boars, chickens, dogs and wild birds) (Box 2).\n\nMany participants indicated that the recent enforcement of wildlife protection laws, as well as gun control policies, has significantly reduced the wildlife hunting, trading or consumption activities. Free or low-priced vaccines for domestic animals were provided by the government, but a lack of access to vaccines in rural areas was reported as one of the main risks associated with raising animals in the household. Participants discussed community healthcare facilities and health insurance, including the national immunization programme for children, as providing accessible protection and preventative services to the local population. Public education about rabies was reported as an example of a zoonotic disease prevention programme that had improved local awareness of the need for protective measures and postexposure treatment. However, the lack of management plans to address human animal conflicts in local communities as discussed by some participants brings potential zoonotic risks (Box 3) (Supplementary Data II).\n\nThis study provided evidence of human\u2013animal interactions in rural communities of southern China that increase the potential for zoonotic disease emergence and suggested opportunities for risk mitigation. Population migration from rural communities to urban areas for employment, as well as the wild animal protection policy changes in China in recent years, have led to a perceived overall reduction in activities such as household animal raising and wildlife trade.30,31 Protective attitudes, knowledge and a supportive social environment for disease prevention were reportedly being developed within the community.31 Existing local preliminary programmes and policies around human and animal health, community development and conservation are considered effective resources to begin or continue developing cost-effective strategies to mitigate zoonotic risks.\n\nIn spite of these positive changes over the long term, there is little understanding within enrolled participants of the transmission mechanisms and ecology of zoonotic pathogens that currently circulate in animal populations in the region. This is of particular concern in rural communities where close contact with bats and rodents was reported, and zoonotic pathogens have been detected in the widely distributed animal populations with the potential to spill over into the human population.20,32\u201335 In addition, rural residents may face a higher risk because of their limited access to quality healthcare facilities for proper diagnosis and treatment compared with urban residents.36\n\nEnforcement of current wildlife protection policy and continued community infrastructure development appears to significantly reduce high-risk contact between humans, wildlife and livestock. Closer collaboration between local animal and human health authorities within the current epidemic disease prevention programmes will provide educational and training opportunities to promote risk-mitigation knowledge, skills and best practice in local communities. For example, cave monitoring and management is a low-cost and efficient method to help restrict human activities (e.g. recreation and mining) that lead to contact with bats in caves. This is of particular importance given the emergence of 2019-nCoV, which appears likely to be a bat-origin coronavirus.10,11\n\nAs the first qualitative study in southern China to assess risk factors for zoonotic disease emergence, our scope was limited by current knowledge, only allowing us to focus on known presumed risk factors. With further urbanization, and subsequent increased interactions between human populations and the changing ecosystems, new risk factors for zoonotic disease transmission will likely emerge. This might include changes to the wildlife trade following the temporary ban put in place as a response to the emergence of 2019-nCoV.9,10 Further research to identify the risk factors among different populations will help develop more locally-relevant and fine-tuned risk mitigation strategies and address the social and ecological bias to identifying recommendations for other community settings. \n\nUsing a qualitative approach, this study allowed us to explore a variety of risk factors at different individual, community and policy levels to contextualize the risks of zoonotic disease emergence in local communities. The findings provide guidance for future in-depth research on specific risk factors, as well as zoonotic disease control and prevention in southern China and potentially other regions with similar ecological and social contexts."}
