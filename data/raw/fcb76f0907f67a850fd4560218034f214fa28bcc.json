P4 phage clone exhibited almost 200-fold improved uptake in ex vivo pancreatic tumor xenografts compared to the negative control. Nanoparticles coated with P4 exhibited ~40-fold improvement in diffusivity in pancreatic tumor tissues, and P4-coated particles demonstrated less hindered diffusivity through the ECM compared to particles functionalized with gold standard poly(ethylene) glycol or iRGD peptide ligand. By leveraging the power of molecular diversity using phage display, we can greatly expand the chemical space of surface chemistries that can improve the transport of nanomedicines through the complex tumor microenvironment to ultimately improve their efficacy.\n\nScreening of phage-presenting peptide library through a tumor ECM model Identification and selection of potential peptide using nextgeneration sequencing\n\nSelection of a faster diffusing clone through in vitro validation using Transwell and multichannel diffusion assay Ex vivo uptake validation of the selected clone followed by comparison of diffusivity of peptide-coated nanoparticle with gold standards using multiple particle tracking\n\nFor successful delivery and efficacy of therapeutics in solid tumors, it is critical for drugs to reach as many target cells as possible to improve their therapeutic index and minimize drug resistance 1 . Increasing penetration of antibodies [2] [3] [4] , small molecule drugs [5] [6] [7] [8] , and nanoparticles [9] [10] [11] [12] through the tumor microenvironment improves drug distribution, achieves tumor regression and significantly improves the therapeutic index of these compounds. The transport of these molecules through the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment significantly depends on their physicochemical properties and their interactions with the tumor extracellular matrix (ECM) 13 .\n\nThe tumor ECM primarily composes of abnormal, overexpressed amounts of collagen, fibronectin, and glycosaminoglycans, which collectively form a net negative charged network that interacts with and impacts transport of molecules through size-based, hydrodynamic, and/or electrostatic interactions 14, 15 .\n\nNanoparticles are promising systems to deliver large quantities of therapeutic cargo while minimizing off-target toxicity in non-tumor tissues (reviewed in 16 ), and engineering these particles for effective transport through the tumor microenvironment is critical towards successful drug delivery. The physicochemical properties of nanoparticles, such as shape, size, and surface chemistry, govern their penetration into tumors, and optimization of these properties can enhance their transport for improved accumulation and retention. The tumor ECM acts as a steric barrier that can filter away particles based on size 17, 18 . To address this problem, extensive efforts have been made to synthesize nanoparticles with smaller diameters 10, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] or different non-spherical shapes 19, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32 to diffuse through the ECM mesh and improve penetration in select tumor types.\n\nWhile the size and shape of nanoparticles have been engineered to circumvent the steric barrier of the ECM, molecules smaller than the pore size of the tumor ECM remain unable to traverse the barrier; the ECM also acts as an interaction barrier that prevents particle transport due to intermolecular interactions 33 . Here, there has been less work to engineer and optimize the surface chemistries of particles to interact (or not) with the ECM for improved tumor penetration.\n\nStudies indicated that positively charged liposomes 34 and poly(lactic-co-glycolic) (PLGA) nanoparticles 35 improved penetration in tumors, whereas in other studies, negatively charged liposomes 36 and gold nanoparticles 37 exhibited improved penetration in spheroids and tumors.\n\nTypically, the surfaces of most nanoparticles are functionalized with poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG) to improve the systemic circulation half-life, but the PEG coating additionally provides a net neutral, hydrophilic surface that facilitates penetration through the tumor ECM due to its inertness.\n\nPEG-coated PLGA and polystyrene nanoparticles exhibited enhanced diffusive transport and penetration through ECM gels 33, 38 and tumor tissues [39] [40] [41] [42] than uncoated positive and/or negative charged particles. While PEGylation has been an attractive strategy for tumor penetration, there are some challenges that limit its feasibility. PEGylation has been shown to hinder cell internalization [43] [44] [45] and endosomal escape 46 needed for drug and gene delivery. Numerous studies have also shown that people possess pre-existing anti-PEG antibodies, which reduces the efficacy and clinical feasibility of PEG-conjugated therapeutics [47] [48] [49] [50] . In addition, repeated systemic dosing of PEGylated formulations can result in the development of anti-PEG antibodies in living subjects [51] [52] [53] . These findings suggest while PEGylation can improve tumor penetration, there are challenges that motivate the need to find alternative surface chemistries.\n\nPeptides are attractive biological materials for surface modification of nanomedicines.\n\nTheir length and sequence can be controlled 54 63 .\n\nIn this work we use phage display technology as a combinatorial approach to generate and identify peptides as surface coatings to achieve improved diffusive transport through the tumor microenvironment. Phage, or bacterial viruses, can be genetically engineered to display peptides on their protein coat and can be pooled together to generate a collection of peptide-presenting phage libraries with excellent molecular diversity (i.e. 10 5 -10 9 different peptide sequences) 64 .\n\nSpecifically, we used T7 phage as the scaffold to display and identify peptide coatings. T7 is an icosahedral virus that can be engineered to display 415 copies of a peptide on its gp10 protein coat and has size features (~70 nm diameter) on the scale of conventional synthetic nanoparticles. T7\n\nphage are biological nanoparticles that can multivalently display different \"peptide-based\" surface chemistries that can be combinatorially screened to identify peptide coatings. Here, we engineered random peptides to be displayed on T7 phage and screened the library against the selective pressure of ECM components found in solid tumors to collect peptide-presenting phage that permeated through the ECM. After successive rounds of selection, permeating phage were harvested, and using next generation sequencing and analysis, the most frequent peptides and motif sequences were identified and subsequently validated in transport studies. Diffusion assays were done to measure and identify peptide-presenting phage that exhibited most unhindered diffusivity through the ECM. Using one of the selected peptides, P4, as a model, we performed site-directed alanine mutagenesis to study the role of hydrophilicity, charge, and the order of the amino acid sequence on diffusive transport through the ECM. We next measured the ability of select peptide-presenting phage to achieve uptake in ex vivo ECM-rich pancreatic cancer xenografts. To demonstrate its feasibility as a surface coating for synthetic nanoparticles, the tumor penetrating peptide was conjugated onto polystyrene nanoparticles, and their diffusive transport in pancreatic tumor tissue was measured using multiple particle tracking and compared to PEG-functionalized and control uncoated nanoparticles. Phage display provides the molecular diversity that can be leveraged to screen and select peptides as surface coatings that facilitate diffusive transport and establish that charge, hydrophilicity, and their orientation govern transport through the tumor ECM. This work highlights the promise of peptides as alternative surface chemistries to improve transport and delivery of nanomedicines for solid tumors and potentially other disease microenvironments.\n\nThe tumor ECM is a barrier that restricts diffusive transport of therapeutics. The interaction between the ECM with the surface physicochemical properties of nanomedicines dictate their transport through this barrier. Here, the objective was to identify peptides as surface coatings using combinatorial selection against the tumor ECM and validate that they improve diffusive transport through the ECM. A second objective was to understand how physicochemical properties of peptides, including charge and hydrophobicity, can affect transport through the ECM barrier.\n\nWe used combinatorial screening (Figure 1a ) with next-generation sequencing and analysis to identify peptides that can achieve diffusive transport through the ECM network present in tumors. A cysteine constrained 9-mer random peptide-presenting T7 phage library was engineered to effectively serve as a collection of peptide-based surface chemistries with a combination of amino acids possessing varying physicochemical properties. The phage library was incubated with a transwell coated with ECM components collagen I (7.8 mg/ml) and hyaluronic acid (HA) (0.84 mg/ml), which are predominant in the tumor microenvironment of pancreatic cancers [65] [66] [67] . The charged ECM components serve as an electrostatic interaction filter that has been shown to hinder diffusion of charged molecules 15, 67 . A 1 mm thickness of tumor ECM was prepared in the insert of a 24-well transwell. The phage library was added at the top of the ECM to allow it to diffuse through the tumor ECM model at 37 \u00baC. After 1 hour of incubation, phage that permeated through the ECM was collected, and a fraction of the output was quantified by standard double-layer plaque assay. The remaining fraction was amplified in E. coli to make more copies needed for the subsequent round of screening. This screening was iterated for three additional rounds and the overall selection was performed in replicate. Selection of peptides using phage libraries is typically reported from one or two screenings 68, 69 .\n\nIterative screening allows the tumor-like ECM to serve as a selection pressure to filter away phage unable to consistently penetrate through the ECM, irrespective of the heterogeneity of its mesh network. In each replicate, we observed an increased amount of phage that permeated through the tumor-like ECM after four rounds (Figure 1b) . The average library titer (i.e. amount of phage) of both replicates increased 200-fold and 400-fold in the third and fourth round compared to the second round. In the third and fourth rounds, the increase of permeating phage suggests there is enrichment of the library for phage that may possess desired functionalities (i.e. unhindered transport) through the tumor-like ECM. There was no increase in the first two rounds, but the lack of initial enrichment is typically observed in phage selections 70 . The enrichment of phage during selection is expected, as observed with affinity-based panning against specific targets [70] [71] [72] . The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/659524 doi: bioRxiv preprint round 1 (R1) to round 2 (R2) and had moderate increase in rounds 3 and 4 (R3 and R4); these results have been observed by others and is indicative of their enrichment [69] [70] [71] 73 . From NGS data, we selected one peptide sequence from the original, na\u00efve library as a negative control for our subsequent experiments. This control peptide sequence is present in the original library, but its frequency decreased with successive rounds of selection, which suggests it was unable to withstand the selection pressure of the tumor-like ECM and cannot permeate through the barrier. Two additional sequences, P4 and P5-peptides, were selected from multiple sequence alignment using Seq2Logo as described elsewhere 69, 74 . Here, multiple sequence alignment of the top thirty frequent peptides from the fourth round of both replicates was done to identify the most abundant amino acid at each position of the 7-mer 75 . From this analysis, we generated and selected The selected peptides along with their physicochemical properties (net charge at pH 7.0 and hydropathy/hydrophobicity) are listed in Table 1 . Three of the five sequences selected are hydrophilic, one is hydrophobic, and one of the sequences is neither hydrophilic nor hydrophobic, which we term as hydro-neutral. The net charge of two of the selected sequences is negative, two are positive, and one of them has a net neutral surface charge at pH 7.0. The net charge of all the selected peptides are near neutral, ranging from -1.0 to +1.1. Table 1 . Peptides selected for validation based on frequency, reproducibility and multiple sequence alignment of the thirty most frequent sequences from both replicates of phage library screening, along with their physicochemical properties.\n\nThe selected and control sequences were each genetically engineered into the T7 vector to display the peptides on the surface of the T7 phage (denoted as P1 to P5-phage, insertless (WT),\n\nHydropathy Net charge at pH 7\n\nAll rights reserved.

The T7 phage are biological nanoparticles; the peptide-presenting phage clones have nanoscale dimensions, and in addition, phage have served as a template for molecular assembly of nanoscale materials and have been used in various applications in nanomedicine 76 .\n\nThe diffusion coefficient of clones is representative of the unhindered diffusivity of individual clones in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) using dynamic light scattering ( Table S1 ). The measured diffusion coefficient of the insertless, WT phage (hydrodynamic diameter ~70 nm) correlates with its theoretical calculation following the Stokes-Einstein equation.\n\nNext, we confirmed that selected and motif peptide-presenting phage exhibited improved diffusion through the tumor-mimetic ECM compared to control phage. Here, we measured the diffusion of the peptide-presenting phage through tumor-like ECM using a fluorescence-based microfluidic channel diffusion assay, as described elsewhere 66 . We prepared the ECM within the channel of a microfluidic chamber \u00b5-slide (Figure 3a) . The tumor ECM in the channel provides a semi-infinite barrier to test the diffusivity of the phage clones. The encapsulated DNA of the phage was fluorescently labeled to avoid surface labeling of phage, which could change the surface properties of the phage and affect interaction and transport through the ECM. Phage were added to the input reservoir, and an equal volume of PBS is added to the output reservoir to maintain the hydrostatic pressure and to achieve a concentration gradient through the channels. Fluorescent images of the channel were acquired at different time points and processed to identify the fluorescence intensity at each time point over the distance of the entire channel (Figure 3b) . The normalized intensity value over the channel length and the entire diffusion time was used for nonlinear curve fitting with the Fick's second law of diffusion to calculate the diffusion coefficient of each clone using a customized MATLAB script ( Figure S2 ).\n\nThe diffusivity of the clones through the ECM varied from 6.40\u00d710 -14 \u00b12.17\u00d710 -14 m 2 /sec for the negative control-phage to 1.05\u00d710 -13 \u00b11.27\u00d710 -14 m 2 /sec for P4-phage, which was in the same order of magnitude as the diffusivity of similar sized T4 phage through gels and artificial biofilm models 77, 78 . Comparable values of 1.62\u00d710 -12 m 2 /sec and 3.39\u00d710 -13 m 2 /sec were reported for diffusion of 50 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/659524 doi: bioRxiv preprint properties of the displayed peptide likely impacted binding to the ECM and subsequent diffusion.\n\nIn particular, the P4-phage demonstrated significantly higher diffusivity through the ECM compared to the control-phage. The hydrophilic and net neutral charged peptide sequence P4 was selected for subsequent studies since it demonstrated highest average diffusivity through the in vitro tumor ECM in the microfluidic and transwell diffusion studies (Figure 3c and Figure S3 ).\n\nWhile net-neutral charge, hydrophilic polymer coatings have improved transport of nanocarriers through ECM 33, 39, 41 , the polymer coating consists of a single repeating unit (e.g. H-\n\n[O-CH2-CH2]n-OH for PEG). Alternatively, due to molecular diversity of amino acids and their ordering in the peptide sequence, we can systematically manipulate select amino acids and determine their contribution to peptide-mediated transport through the ECM. To determine the impact of charge, hydrophobicity, and spatial order of physicochemical properties on transport through the ECM, we performed alanine mutagenesis on the selected P4. We substituted specific amino acids with alanine, which has an inert methyl functional side chain group that does not change the main conformation of the peptide, and thereby we removed the functional groups to create mutants with different surface physicochemical characteristics. We investigated the effect of net charge, hydrophobicity, and order of the amino acid sequence on diffusive transport through the tumor ECM using the aforementioned microchannel diffusion assay.\n\nThe P4 sequence has one basic amino acid, and the remaining residues are polar amino acids. To alter the net charge, we mutated the basic and acidic positions to alanine to create negative (-1) and positive (+1) charge modifications, respectively ( Table 2a) .

The original neutral clone exhibits approximately 1.5-fold higher effective diffusivity compared to the positive and negative modifications (Figure 4a) . As a result of the alanine mutations, the hydrophobicity of the sequences has also been changed due to the removal of the polar acidic and basic amino acid residues. A similar decrease in hydrophilicity was also observed during library screening, where highly positive and negative charged peptides (with polar basic and acidic residues) were filtered out with increased rounds (Figures S1a and S1b).\n\nNext, we determined the role of hydrophobicity on transport of our selected peptide through the ECM. We modified the hydrophobicity of the original sequence through alanine mutagenesis of some or all of the polar amino acids, as indicated in Table 2b . In one of the modifications, we designed a peptide that is neither hydrophilic nor hydrophobic, which we termed hydro-neutral. We also generated a hydrophobic sequence where all of the polar amino acids were substituted with alanine. These modifications retained the same net charge of the original sequence while altering the hydrophobicity ( Table 2b) . The original hydrophilic clone demonstrated 2fold and 1.5-fold higher diffusivity than the hydro-neutral and hydrophobic clones, respectively ( Figure 4b) . This result is similar to reports where hydrophilic PEG coatings on hydrophobic polystyrene and poly(lactic-co-glycolic) nanoparticles improved their diffusivity through brain 41 and breast 39 tumor microenvironments. Hydrophobic surfaces of particles can strongly bind to the ECM 41 , and hydrophilic coatings minimize adhesion.\n\nNext, we made alterations to the order of the amino acid sequence to understand how changing the spatial order of the physicochemical properties affects diffusive transport through the tumor ECM. We made two modifications-(1) interchange the position of the basic and the acidic All rights reserved.

The net charge and hydrophobicity of the mutant sequences remain the same as the original sequence. From diffusion assays, the original selected sequence exhibits three-fold and two-fold higher effective diffusivity compared to the interchanged and adjacent mutants, respectively (Figure 4c) . This result suggests that the order of the amino acid sequence significantly impacts the diffusivity through the tumor-like ECM.

We measured and quantified ex vivo uptake of our peptide-presenting phage in ECM-rich BxPC3 pancreatic tumor xenografts 79 as described by Bajpayee et al. 80 . Briefly, the BxPC3 tumor tissue slices were preequilibrated in PBS with protease inhibitor and incubated with in a bath of sample, P4 or control-phage. We calculated the clone uptake ratio in the tissue by quantifying the amount of phage in the tissue to the amount in the incubation bath over several days. The average uptake of selected clone P4-phage dramatically increased from 1.67\u00d710 3 \u00b12.08\u00d710 3 after 1 day to 1.34\u00d710 8 \u00b12.31\u00d710 8 after 5 days of the incubation, whereas the tumor uptake of the negative control-phage only increased from 1.12\u00d710 3 \u00b14.94\u00d710 2 in 1 day to 7.27\u00d710 5 \u00b11.32\u00d710 5 in 5 days ( Figure 5) . Consequently, the uptake ratio of P4-phage is 200 times higher than that of the negative control-phage after five days of incubation with the ex vivo tumor tissue. At initial timepoints, the rate of uptake is similar for both clones, but at later timepoints, there is a larger concentration gradient for our selected clone. This gradient allows continued diffusion and further transport of the P4-phage into the tumor tissue than observed with the control-phage. The difference in concentration gradients resulting in improved tissue uptake has been observed in cartilage explants [80] [81] [82] and mucus hydrogels 63 .\n\nAll rights reserved.

Here, fluorescent nanoparticles were conjugated with our selected peptide or gold standard controls from literature, and their displacement in tumors was tracked and measured using particle tracking microscopy.\n\nWe compared the penetration of P4-coated nanoparticle through the tumor ECM with two functionalized controls that have been previously used to improve the penetration and/or uptake of nanoparticles. iRGD peptide (CRGDKGPDC), which is a cysteine constrained 9-mer peptide sequence identified by phage display, has been extensively demonstrated to improve solid tumor penetration 59 . In addition, low molecular weight PEG surface modification of nanoparticles has been shown to improve their diffusivity through various biological barriers including mucus 83 \n\nControl-phage All rights reserved.

We conjugated the peptides and PEG coatings to fluorescent carboxylate nanoparticles via standard EDC bioconjugation chemistry. We selected PEG 1 kDa to match with the size of the peptide used in this work. As a result, the size and surface properties of all the particles are similar ( Table 3) , and therefore any change in the diffusivity of the particles is due to their interactions with the tumor tissue. Table 3 . Characterization of the PEG/peptide coated nanoparticle formulations.\n\nWe performed multiple particle tracking to measure the displacement of the surface modified nanoparticles through ex vivo BxPC3 tumor tissue xenografts (Script S1). The collective movement of uncoated nanoparticles was strongly hindered in the tumor tissue ( Figure 6 and Table 3 ). The average MSD of the uncoated particles was 10 -4 to 10 -3 \u00b5m 2 , which is nearly tenfold less compared to the value reported by Dancy All rights reserved.

Both PEGylation and iRGD-coating improved the MSD of the nanoparticle 10-and 15-fold, respectively (Figure 6b) . This improvement is most likely due to their hydrophilic and less negative surface charge properties. Interestingly, the P4-peptide coating improved the MSD of the nanoparticle 40-fold, exhibiting greater improvement than the other coatings. Examining the individual particle diffusivity binned together as ensemble measurements through the tumor ECM, there is a shift in particle distribution towards higher MSD upon PEG or P4-peptide coating (Figures 6c and 6d) . In particular, there is a larger fraction of peptide-coated nanoparticles that are mobile and demonstrate rapid diffusivity (log MSD is greater than -0.5) compared to PEG-coated nanoparticles (5% to 1%, respectively). Given that the same molar ratio was used to conjugate peptide/PEG onto nanoparticles, this result suggests that the optimal peptide coating improves unhindered particle transport through the tumor ECM.\n\nNext, we quantified the MSD of the uncoated particle through PBS using particle tracking (Script S1 and Figure S4 ) and used these measurements to understand how the tumor ECM hinders nanoparticle transport ( Table 3) . The ensemble-averaged MSD of the particles in tumor ECM was compared to the unhindered MSD of the uncoated bead through PBS after 1 sec time lag ( Table 3) . There was a ~2000-fold decrease in the MSD of the uncoated nanoparticle through the tumor, whereas peptide and PEG-coatings reduced the hindrance of nanoparticle transport through the tumor tissue. P4 surface-coating most effectively reduced hindered transport, with only a ~57-fold decrease in transport in tumor relative to unhindered transport in PBS.\n\nAll rights reserved.

The use of next-generation DNA sequencing allows us to expand the sequence sample space of peptides that can be analyzed and tested for improved transport. From next-generation sequencing data and in silico analysis, we identified specific peptides and motif sequences that enhanced transport through the ECM barrier.\n\nSelect peptide-presenting clones exhibit rapid transport, as evidenced by an significant increase in their tumor transport compared to the negative control. Through systematic mutagenesis of the model P4 peptide-presenting phage, we demonstrate that alterations of the physicochemical properties and the configuration of the peptide impacts transport. We hypothesize that the mutations change the binding affinity of the peptide with the ECM, thereby hindering their diffusion. The role of binding interactions and its impact on diffusion has been observed in peptide transport in mucus and cartilage; however, further studies are warranted to confirm this mechanism in the tumor microenvironment. The model peptide-presenting phage exhibited increased uptake in tumor tissue compared to the negative control. Importantly, peptides are promising as surface coatings to improve nanoparticle transport through the tumor microenvironment. Peptide coatings reduce the hindered transport of uncoated nanoparticles through the tumor ECM and demonstrate improved transport compared to gold standard polymeric coatings.

While additional studies are needed to study how molecular weight and density of peptide and PEG coatings affect diffusion through tumors and tumor-like environments, these findings highlight the potential of peptides as alternative coatings to improve diffusion and distribution of nanomedicines. Collectively, these results suggest that peptide-based libraries are an attractive technology that possess excellent molecular diversity from which new chemistries identified with desired functionalities to improve molecule transport and delivery through the barriers of diseases.\n\nAn in vitro tumor ECM was prepared following a method from Chauhan et al. 85 .

The library is a collection of phage presenting cysteine-constrained random 7-mer peptides (denoted as CX7C) on the surface of the T7 gp10 capsid. We screened the phage library against the in vitro tumor ECM using a transwell assay. Tumor-like ECM (thickness ~1 mm) was prepared in the insert of a 3.0 \u00b5m pore size polyester membrane 24-well transwell (Corning). Approximately 3.2\u00d710 8 plaque forming units (i.e. amount of phage) of the phage library was added at the top of the tumor ECM in the donor chamber. To allow sufficient time for phage to enter ECM prior to measuring diffusivity, a time lag of 15 minutes was allotted based on theoretical calculations for phage to achieve unhindered diffusion through saline. After, the insert was transferred to a new receiving chamber filled with 600 \u00b5L of 1\u00d7 PBS to maintain the hydrostatic pressure needed for diffusivity.\n\nWe then performed the diffusion assay at 37 \u00b0C and collected the entire eluate from the receiving chamber after 1 hour. Part of the output was quantified, or titered, by standard double-layer plaque assay. A fraction of the eluate was used for next-generation sequencing (discussed in the next section), and the remaining fraction was amplified to make more copies that would be used for subsequent rounds of screening. The phage were amplified in BL21 E. Coli. (Novagen) for 3 hours as followed by the manufacturer's recommendation and were quantified by titering. The selection was repeated for another three rounds using the same amount of input phage. With each iterative round of selection, the ECM acts a selection pressure to filter out phage clones that are not fit and cannot permeate; only clones that achieve penetrating transport through the barrier are enriched.\n\nPhage library screening were performed in replicate.\n\nSample preparation for next-generation sequencing All rights reserved.

Prior to NGS preparation, ten microliters of each library sample (~10 8 pfu/\u00b5L) was denatured at 100 \u00b0C for 15 minutes to lyse the phage and release the encapsulated DNA. The workflow for NGS sample preparation was based on manufacturers recommendation (Illumina 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Protocol).\n\nBriefly, the random insert region of the T7 library DNA was amplified from the denatured phage sample by PCR using 2\u00d7 KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (KAPA Biosystems). An additional PCR was performed to attach dual indices and overhanging adapters that would be used to recognize individual samples from the final pooled library of all samples (i.e. each round from each replicate pooled together). The primers for the barcoding were provided from the Nextra XT Index kit (FC-131-1001, Illumina). The PCR amplicon was purified from the free primers using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) after each PCR amplification step. The size of the purified PCR product was verified by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, and the DNA concentration was quantified using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) after each PCR step. After purification, each sample was diluted to 40 nM with 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.5. One microliter of each sample was pooled together, and the library was run on Illumina MiSeq (The University of Texas at Austin (UT-Austin) Genomic Sequencing and Analysis Facility).\n\nAll rights reserved.

However, it was important to label the phage without affecting the coat protein, thus conserving the surface physicochemical properties of the phage clones. As a result, the encapsidated DNA of the selected peptide-presenting T7 phage was labeled with SYBR Gold dye with a slight modification of the protocol described by Mosier-Boss et al. (2003) 88 . Briefly, the SYBR Gold dye (ThermoFisher Scientific) was diluted to 100\u00d7 from the 10,000\u00d7 stock concentration using 1\u00d7 PBS. Sixty microliters of each clone (10 8 pfu/\u00b5L) was incubated with 500 \u00b5L of diluted dye for 20 minutes on a rocker (ThermoFisher Scientific) at room temperature. One hundred microliters of sterile 50% PEG 8000 was added to the labeled clone, incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C, and centrifuged at 17000g for 30 minutes. The supernatant containing unlabeled free dye was decanted away from the labeled phage pellet, which was subsequently resuspended with 1\u00d7 PBS. The suspension was filtered using a syringe filter 0.2 \u00b5m PES membrane (VWR). To ensure complete removal of any trace amounts of free dye, the phage suspension underwent a second round of purification using ultrafiltration with Amicon Ultra 3 kDa molecular weight cutoff of 0.5mL centrifugal filters (MilliporeSigma) and five 1\u00d7 PBS washes. After centrifugation, the resulting phage pellet was resuspended with 150 \u00b5L of 1\u00d7 PBS and transferred to a fresh tube.\n\nWe visualized the transport of the fluorescently labeled phage clones along the length of a microfluidic chip over time to calculate the diffusivity of each clone, adapting from a method by Raeesi and Chan 66 . The microchannels of \u00b5-slide (Ibidi) were loaded with 30 \u00b5L of the in vitro tumor ECM and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour to allow sufficient time for gelation. The channel length is 17 mm, with 3.8 mm width and 0.4 mm height. Therefore, it acts as a one-dimensional All rights reserved.

The background intensity for each channel was subtracted from the spatiotemporal intensity profile and was then normalized based on the maximum fluorescence intensity. The intensity decay was plotted along with the penetration length after 6 hours of diffusion. The average diffusion coefficient of the clones was calculated from the non-linear curve fitting of each experimental normalized intensity decay values with the onedimensional analytical Fick's second law of diffusion (1). The diffusion coefficient was assumed to be independent of the concentration of the clone and the penetration depth. \n\nWhere, All rights reserved.

Specific amino acids of the peptide sequence were mutated to alanine to alter the net charge and hydropathy. We also investigated how altering the spatial distribution of physicochemical properties impacts transport by changing the amino acid position of the selected peptide sequence.\n\nComplementary oligonucleotides encoding the mutant phages were designed and synthesized by IDT. The oligonucleotides were annealed at 95 \u00b0C for 3 minutes and were cooled down to 25\u00b0C at 0.1 \u00b0C/sec using BioRad C1000 thermocycler. The annealed oligonucleotides were phosphorylated using T4 ligase buffer (NEB), and the T7Select415-1b vector arm (MilliporeSigma) was dephosphorylated following the manufacturer's protocols. The phosphyorylated insert was ligated into the dephosphorylated vector at 16\u00b0C for 16 hours. The ligated product was then packaged, grown, and plated as described earlier. To confirm that the sequences were correctly cloned into the T7 vector, individual plaques were grown, their DNA was purified and confirmed by Sanger DNA sequencing (UT GSAF). The diffusivity of the mutants was performed and calculated using previously described microfluidic channel diffusion assays.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Six to eight weeks old female athymic nude mice were purchased from Taconic Biosciences. Approximately 4\u00d710 6 cells BxPC3 cells (ATCC) in 100 \u00b5L of RPMI were mixed with 100 \u00b5L of Matrigel and subcutaneously inoculated in both flanks of mice under 2-3% isoflurane anesthesia. Tumors were palpable after three to four weeks, and mice were humanely euthanized to harvest the tumors. Tumors were removed, and tumor slices of 3 mm diameter were prepared using a reusable biopsy punch (World Precision Instruments).\n\nThe uptake of the hydrophilic, net neutral C5 clone was compared to the negative control clone following the protocol as described by Bajpayee et al. 80 . Briefly, the tumor slices were preequilibrated with 1\u00d7 PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete ULTRA Tablets, Roche Applied Science) for 24 -48 hours in a 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 incubator. Tumor slices were then incubated with 300 \u00b5L of 10 6 pfu/\u00b5L P4 or control-phage supplemented with protease inhibitors in a 96-well plate. The 96-well plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 for five days. Ten microliter samples from the bath were collected every day, and the bath titer of the clones were calculated using standard double-layer plaque assay. The number of phage were in the tumor slice was calculated based on the difference between the initial and final bath titer. At the end of 5 days, the tumor slice surfaces were blotted with Kimwipes, and wet weight of the tissue was measured. The slices were then lyophilized for 24 hours, and dry weight was measured; the water weight inside the tissue was calculated by subtracting the dry tissue weight from the wet tissue weight. The clone uptake ratio was calculated based on the clone titer inside the tissue to that of the clone titer in the bath at that given time point.\n\nAll rights reserved.

C-terminal amidated P4 and iRGD peptides (LifeTein) and methoxy-PEG 1kamine (Alfa Aesar) were covalently conjugated to the COOH functional group of the nanoparticle at a molar ratio of 5:1 using standard carbodiimide chemistry with (1-ethyl-3-[3dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride) (EDC) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Sulfo-(N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide) (Sulfo-NHS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific), following manufacturer's protocol. After conjugation, we performed dialysis for 24 hours against 1\u00d7 PBS using 100 kDa molecular weight cut-off dialysis membrane (Spectrum Labs) for buffer exchange and to remove unconjugated PEG/peptide. Size and the zeta potential of the uncoated and peptide/PEG conjugated nanoparticles were measured by suspending the particles in 10 mM NaCl at 25 \u00b0C. The nanoparticle formulations were stored at 4 \u00b0C for particle tracking experiments.\n\nNanoparticle diffusion in pancreatic tumor slices using multiple particle tracking Diffusion of the surface functionalized nanoparticles in BxPC3 tumor tissue slices was measured by multiple particle tracking following method described in Dancy et al. 39 . Briefly, the tumor tissue slices were placed on custom microscope slide chambers, and 0.5 \u00b5L of 50 \u00b5g/mL of yellow-green fluorescent nanoparticles were injected to the ex vivo tumor tissue using a Hamilton syringe. The slide chambers were sealed using a coverslip, and the particles were allowed to equilibrate with the tumor tissue at 37\u00b0C for 15 minutes. The fluorescence intensity of the individual particles was then tracked at a frame rate of 15 frames/sec for 20 sec using an inverted fluorescence IX-83 Olympus microscope with 100X/1.3 NA oil-immersion objective with 65 All rights reserved.

Five movies were recorded for each tissue slice, and three independent experiments were performed for each nanoparticle formulation.\n\nTime-lapse images were analyzed using a customized Matlab script (Script S1) developed in our lab based on the Crocker and Grier algorithm and the Matlab version of particle tracking code repository developed by Blair & Dufresne 89, 90 . Based on the size and the threshold intensity value of the fluorescence, the centroid of the nanoparticles were determined in each image. The particle trajectory was estimated by linking the particle locations between frames, and based on a simple random-walk trajectory, the mean square displacement of the particles within a time scale was estimated. The mean square displacement (MSD) was calculated as \u2329\u2206 @ ( )\u232a = \u2329| ( + ) \u2212 ( )| @ \u232a, where is the position vector of the particle, and is the lag time. The ensemble average of MSDs (\u2329\u2329\u2206 @ ( )\u232a\u232a) of collected individual particles was calculated to average the MSD's over a time lag of 1 sec over multiple particles 91 .\n\nThere are no conflicts to declare.
