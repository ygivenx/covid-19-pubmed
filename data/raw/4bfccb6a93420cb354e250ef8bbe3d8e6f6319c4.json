Answering the question is of great helpful for the follow-up of convalescent patients and the control of epidemic.\n\nThe illustrated pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 seems to be similar to SARS-CoV in some ways. Besides, a recent study showed that neutralizing antibody from a convalescent SARS patient could block the SARS-CoV-2 from entering into target cells in vitro 1 , which implies the potential cross-protective epitode between the two viruses. Thus, the potential immune protection against reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 may share some common features with convalescent SARS-CoV. "}
