{"title": "Efficacy of an inactivated and adjuvanted \u201cZULVAC\u00ae 8 OVIS\u201d vaccine produced using single-use bioreactors", "body": "Bluetongue virus (BTV) first emerged in the European Union (EU) in 2006, peaking at 45,000 cases in 2008. The EU spent million of euros in 2008 and 2009 on eradicating and monitoring programs, co-financed with member states. The number of cases in 2009 was 1118, with only 120 reported across the EU so far last year. Vaccination has proven itself as the most effective tool to control and prevent the disease and to facilitate the safe trade of live animals.\n\nMammalian cells are commonly used as a substrate for production of most of the viral vaccines. BHK-21 cells are used for the production of bluetongue vaccines. Most companies use roller bottles or conventional bioreactors, but taking into account that the manufacturing cost is very important, the possibility of using Single-Use Bioreactor (SUB) technology as an alternative to roller bottles or conventional bioreactors was explored. Advantages like yields of production, time reduction (elimination of cleaning and sterilization steps needed for bioreactors, no validation process, etc) and quality of antigen production were studied.\n\nBHK-21 cell line was used due to the good yields. Cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in Minimum Essential Medium Glasgow supplemented with serum.\n\nThe growth of the BHK-21 cells and virus production was conducted in roller bottles (RB), 10-L bioreactor (Biostat B-plus) and in 250-L SUB (Hyclone).\n\nCells on bioreactors and SUB were cultivated using microcarriers (Cytodex-3) at a density of 3g/L. The crystal violet dye nucleus staining method was used to estimate cell density.\n\nDissolved oxygen (DO) and pH were automatically adjusted by addition gases (CO2, and air).\n\nBTV serotype 8 (BTV-8), strain BEL2006/02 was used in all experiments. The strain was supplied by \u201cVeterinary and Agrochemical Research Centre\u201d (VAR-CODA-CERVA), Ukkel, Belgium.\n\nOnce the cells were 80-100% confluent, RB, 10-L bioreactor and 250-L SUB were infected under identical conditions and with a constant multiplicity of infection (MOI). Harvesting of virus was done when cytopathic effect (CPE) was about 90- 100%.\n\nVirus production was evaluated by TCID50/ml.\n\nThe antigen obtained on SUB was inactivated by Binary Ethylenimine (BEI) and adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide and saponin. The efficacy of the vaccine was tested in lambs.\n\nForty, 1.5 month-old, lambs were included in the study.\n\nThirty lambs were vaccinated and revaccinated 3 weeks later by subcutaneous route and ten lambs were left as unvaccinated controls. Forty-four days after revaccination all lambs were challenged with BTV-8.\n\nThe antibody response in vaccinated lambs was evaluated from vaccination until the moment of challenge by a seroneutralization test (see table 1).\n\nViremia (presence of BTV genome in blood samples) was evaluated by real time qRT-PCR [1] in blood samples obtained before challenge and during four weeks after challenge.\n\nFigure 3, shows the results of the virus titers in 250-L SUB compared with those obtained in RB and 10-L bioreactor.\n\nThe virus titer reached in a 10L bioreactor was comparable with the levels obtained in SUB. Preliminary results prove that by using SUB, the yields obtained in roller bottles can increase more than two times.\n\nDetermination of neutralizing antibodies (NA) titer against BTV serotype 8 in the samples taken after vaccination and revaccination was done by means of seroneutralization test. Table 1 show the geometric mean NA titers.\n\nIn any of the lambs of the vaccinated and challenged groups, viral gemone could be detected by RT-PCR during 27 days after challenge. Whereas in all unvaccinated and challenged lambs, the viral genome was detected from day 3-5 p.i.\n\n\u2022 The results obtained using a 250-L SUB concerning the cell concentration and virus titer, were similar to those reached in a 10L bioreactor and higher than in roller bottles.\n\n\u2022 Efficacy results on lambs confirm that the quality of antigen produced in SUB are similar of the antigen produced both in roller bottles and on conventional bioreactor.\n\n\u2022 We can think on the possibility of using disposable systems in vaccines production in order to reduce the production costs.\n\n\u2022 SUB can be an alternative to conventional production methods:\n\n\u283c Reduced facility complexity, reduction of the cost of building, and possibility of the rapid expansion of the capacity of the production.\n\n\u283c Reduction of the capital of equipment and equipment validation, etc.\n\n\u283c Avoid the cleaning process and reduction of the risk of cross-contamination."}
