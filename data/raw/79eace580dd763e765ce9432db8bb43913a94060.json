{"title": "Migration of Waterfowl in the East Asian Flyway and Spatial Relationship to HPAI H5N1 Outbreaks HHS Public Access", "body": "were identified (mallard, falcated teal [Anas falcata], and Chinese spotbill), the results were pooled into a mixed \"migratory duck\" category that combined species with contrasting ecology and behavior, limiting ecological interpretation of these findings (12, 31, 45) . Both Mukhtar et al. and Chen et al. have implicated wild waterfowl at Poyang Lake in HPAI H5N1 transmission, and both proposed a possible link to Qinghai Lake, where the largest recorded wild bird epizootic occurred in 2005 (6, 29) . However, little empirical information was available at that time on the migratory movements of wild ducks from the Poyang and Qinghai regions to ecologically establish an association with HPAI H5N1 outbreaks.\n\nIn this paper, we present results from eight wild duck species including the Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope), northern pintail (Anas acuta), common teal (Anas crecca), falcated teal, Baikal teal (Anas formosa), mallard, garganey (Anas querquedula), and Chinese spotbill, marked with satellite transmitters at Poyang Lake, Wuhan, China during 2007-08. The infection status of birds marked at the onset of the project in March 2007 was diagnosed using both reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and serological testing. We used telemetry locations to develop movement models and utilization distributions of the East Asian Flyway migration routes. We compared these migratory pathways with regional HPAI H5N1 outbreaks reported from this region in poultry and wild birds to determine if there were spatial relationships between wild duck movements and outbreak areas. Finally, we examined relationships between the timing of outbreaks and wild duck life-cycle stages to see if they were correlated.\n\nDucks were captured at Poyang Lake (29\u00b009\u2032N, 116\u00b013\u2032E) located 50 km northeast of Nanchang in Jiangxi Province, China. Poyang Lake is fed by the Gan and Xiu rivers, and its shallow basin is connected to the Yangtze River. The lake is part of a large alluvial floodplain with seasonal rainfall (between May and September) that expands its area to about 4000 km 2 (38) . Severe flooding has been common since 1950s because of land reclamation, levee construction, and El Ni\u00f1o events (38) . The surrounding land use is dominated by rice agriculture, as Poyang Lake is in the center of China's rice production region. The lake basin also supports a rich benthic community of at least 58 invertebrate taxa, which exceeds resources available to waterfowl in the adjacent river systems (41) . Satellite telemetry locations for ducks marked at Poyang Lake were used to describe the spring migration range of waterfowl in the East Asian Flyway, extending northward from Poyang Lake to northeast China and southeastern Siberia.\n\nWe captured ducks between March 8 and 20, 2007, and November 27 and December 7, 2007 , on the western side of Poyang Lake, China. We captured one duck in a line of monofilament leg nooses, but most ducks were captured by local cooperators with large mistnets erected across open water. Upon capture, birds were placed in individual cloth bags and promptly processed. We recorded species identity, mass, flat wing chord, diagonal or short tarsus (8) , sex, and age for each bird.\n\nDucks were marked with 12 or 18 g solar-powered, 30 g GPS-solar-powered, or 26 g battery-implant Platform Terminal Transmitters (PTT-100 and solar-GPS PTT-100, Microwave Telemetry, Inc., Columbia, MD, USA). Solar transmitters were secured to birds with a teflon harness (Bally Ribbon Mills, Bally, PA), and the implant transmitters were surgically secured in the abdominal cavity (26) by a veterinarian with the antenna protruding dorsally. Transmitter packages averaged <3% of the bird's body weight. Birds were released near capture locations as soon as possible after processing. Procedures for capture, handling, and marking were approved by the USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nPTTs were programmed to transmit for 10-hr periods every 2 days, and GPS-PTTs were scheduled to record 6-12 GPS locations each day. Transmissions were received by the Argos satellite tracking system (CLS America Inc., Largo, MD). CLS calculated PTT locations from the perceived Doppler-effect shifts in transmission frequency during a satellite overpass. Each Doppler-derived PTT location was accompanied by a location quality class index. CLS reports a 1-sigma error radius of >1000 m, 350-1000 m, 150-350 m, and \u2264150 m, for location classes indices 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Auxiliary location classes A, B, and Z are not assigned accuracy estimates by CLS. We used a filtering algorithm (D. Douglas, Version 7.03, http://alaska.usgs.gov/science/biology/spatial/) to identify and remove implausible auxiliary Doppler locations based on distance moved, movement rate, and turning angle. We used ArcGIS 9.2 (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc., Redlands, CA) and Google Earth 5.0 (Google, Mountain View, CA) to plot telemetry locations. Migratory stopover sites were defined as areas where birds moved less than 20 km \u2265 24 hr time period.\n\nWe coanalyzed telemetry locations with a variety of digital thematic maps. For habitat features we used the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/Terra Land Cover Classification, distributed by the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center, U.S. Geological Survey Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science (http:// LPDAAC.usgs.gov). The MODIS/Terra Land Cover Classification contains a primary thematic that delineates 17 land cover classes defined by the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP). We used a University of Maryland modification of the IGBP scheme (Land Cover Type 2), which we generalized into five broad land cover categories: 1) water, 2) upland or natural vegetation, including barren or sparsely vegetated areas, 3) wetland, 4) cropland or cropland mosaic, and 5) urban.\n\nPoultry density data were obtained from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) via the Geonetwork (http://www.fao.org/geonetwork). Methodology and sources of the estimates are described in the FAO's Gridded Livestock of the World (44) . Briefly, for each country the most recent available livestock census data were converted into densities to produce \"observed\" data and then disaggregated based on statistical relations with environmental variables in similar agro-ecological zones to produce \"predicted\" poultry distributions. The data files were disseminated in raster format (0.0833\u00b0 resolution), with pixel values containing estimated poultry densities (head/km 2 ).\n\nInformation about HPAI H5N1 outbreaks were obtained from the Emergency Prevention System for Transboundary Animal and Plant Pests and Diseases (EMPRES) Database (11) for the period December 2003-February 2009. The 7-yr time frame for outbreaks was used to maximize the number of cases included in statistical analyses, providing a more complete outbreak pattern. Variables associated with each outbreak included date, location (country, administrative region, locality, latitude and longitude), reliability of the field veterinarian's diagnosis and the laboratory approach that was used to confirm viral subtype, and whether the outbreak occurred in wild birds or poultry. We restricted our analyses to records considered reliable according to the FAO EMPRES Program and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).\n\nWe pooled species into four groups according to body mass: 1) falcated teal, 2) small teal (common teal, garganey, Baikal teal), 3) Eurasian wigeon, and 4) Chinese spotbill. We used all tracking locations that described the spring migration route of each waterfowl group (March to July 2007) for statistical analyses. We applied a fixed kernel home range analysis (19) of each bird's migration route to identify stopover sites. The fixed kernel analysis was performed using Animal Space Use (v. 1.2 Beta) software (20) and applied a least squares cross-validation method to obtain the kernel smoothing parameter. We applied Brownian bridge movement models (21) to create utilization distributions for spring migration pathways of each species group. We used Animal Space Use (v. 1.2) to create the Brownian bridge utilization distributions (BBUDs) and assumed the distribution of location errors was circular normal.\n\nFor coanalysis with virus outbreak data, we used the 99% BBUDs for each species group to avoid location outliers. We averaged the BBUDs of all species groups to describe a population-level spring migration route (21) and extracted the upper 60% utilization distribution, partitioned into six 10% intervals (i.e., 40-99%). We included 29 FAO-OIE confirmed HPAI H5N1 outbreak events from 2003 to 2009 involving wild and domestic birds that occurred within the population-level BBUD spring migration corridor. Wild bird mortalities were not analyzed according to taxon because most outbreak cases from this region were identified as \"waterbirds\" (32) . We spatially intersected each HPAI H5N1 outbreak location with the land cover and poultry density maps. An equal number of random locations from within the overall BBUD were also intersected for comparison with the outbreak locations.\n\nAn information theoretic approach (Akaike Information Criterion [AIC]) was used to compare outbreak and random locations under 21 a priori defined logistic regression models.\n\nCovariates for the logistic models included latitude, habitat type (water, upland, wetland, cropland, and urban), poultry density, and utilization distribution (BBUD). Models within 2.0 \u0394AIC of the top-ranked model were considered to have biological significance (3). All analyses were conducted in Program-R (36) using the \"glm\" function (family = binomial, link = logit).\n\nWe divided the annual cycle of wild ducks into four seasonal stages in their life cycle on the basis of the area, scale of movement, and arrival and departure dates. These stages were 1) breeding and post-breeding (including annual moult): May 1-October 2; 2) fall migration: October 3-November 18; 3) nonbreeding: November 19-February 20; and 4) spring migration: February 21-April 30. We examined the null hypothesis of equal probability of an outbreak within season by comparing likelihood ratios during the four seasonal stages. To evaluate temporal variation, we weighted each PTT-marked duck equally and calculated average poultry exposure estimates throughout the annual cycle. We used a G-statistic (46) to detect if there was a significant difference between the number of observed (reported in EMPRES database) and expected (random distribution in time) outbreaks for each of the four seasonal stages.\n\nVirological analyses were performed on samples collected from birds marked during March 2007, but not performed for samples collected during recapture. We obtained cloacal and tracheal swabs and blood from each bird following standard sampling and transport procedures (10) . For all birds three analyses were performed. The first test, a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (KeQian Biology Technology Ltd, China), was used to detect the presence of type A influenza virus antigen with optical density recorded at 630 nm wavelength (OD 630 ). An OD 630 value above 0.23 was regarded as positive. The second test, an rRT-PCR assay, targeted the Matrix gene (13) and was used to screen for type A influenza virus RNA. The third test, an indirect ELISA kit (KeQian Biology Technology), was used to detect the presence of AIV H5 antibody with an OD 630 value above 0.40 regarded as positive. Tests were conducted according to OIE standards (33) . Laboratory analyses were conducted by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan Institute of Virology, China.\n\nWe obtained a total of 13,699 locations from 33 ducks marked with PTTs at Poyang Lake in 2007 including the Chinese spotbill (13 adults: 6 males, 7 females), falcated teal (5 adults: 4 males, 1 female; 1 first-year female), Eurasian wigeon (5 adults: 1 male, 4 females), common teal (3 adult males; 1 first-year male), Baikal teal (2 adult males), garganey (1 adult male), northern pintail (1 first-year female), and mallard (1 adult male; Table 1 ). The total number of locations obtained per duck varied widely (2-909) as did the duration over which signals were received (14-617 days). We obtained few locations for the northern pintail, so it was excluded from analyses. Similarly, the mallard was excluded from analyses because the individual we captured was a resident. The Chinese spotbills were nonmigratory and yearround residents at Poyang Lake. We recovered spring migration tracks for 12 of the other 18 migratory ducks.\n\nNone of the birds migrated from the East Asian nonbreeding area at Poyang Lake to the Qinghai Lake breeding area in the Central Asian Flyway (Fig. 1) . A single falcated teal migrated northwest toward the Central Asian Flyway, but it stopped 700 km northeast of Qinghai Lake on the eastern edge of the Gobi Desert, a region that presents a large ecological barrier to waterfowl migration.\n\nFalcated teal-We obtained 1557 total locations for migrating falcated teal ( Table 1 ). The falcated teal departed from Poyang Lake from March 28 to April 29. From late March through late April, they used migration sites in the Lower Yangtze River in Anhui and Zhejiang Provinces to the southwest of Shanghai (Table 2 ). In late April they migrated to sites on Bohai Bay (Fig. 2B) including a stopover site on the south side near Qingdao in Shandong Province. One falcated teal migrated to the northwest, but all other birds migrated along the coast to northern China and southeast Siberia. The core of their spring migration corridor was in the northeastern region of Manchuria in China (Fig. 3A) .\n\nCommon teal-We obtained 1942 total locations for the species group of small teal that included common teal (4), Baikal teal (2), and garganey (1; Table 1 ). These teal departed from Poyang Lake from March 26 to May 3. Like the larger falcated teal, they used migration sites in the Lower Yangtze River in Anhui and Zhejiang Provinces to the west of Shanghai (Table 2 ; Fig. 3B ). In late April they migrated to coastal wetland staging areas to the south of Bohai Bay on the Lower Huang River, and to the north of Bohai Bay off the coasts of South Korea, North Korea, and China (Fig. 2B ). The small teal migrated farther north than the falcated teal into eastern Siberia south of the Sea of Okhotsk. Their BBUD was similar to that of falcated teal with a more southerly concentration.\n\nEurasian wigeon-We obtained 1294 total locations for Eurasian wigeon (Table 1) . Eurasian wigeon seemed to depart Poyang Lake later than the teal, but their first recorded postdeparture locations were not until late April in northeast China (Figs. 2A, 3C). We obtained fewer locations for the wigeon, so it is difficult to determine if the seemingly late timing of their migration was due to inferior PTT performance (three of the five birds had implant battery-powered transmitters). Eurasian wigeon migrated farther northeast than other ducks, crossing the Sea of Okhotsk and concentrating in the Magadan Oblast of northeast Siberia (Fig. 3C) .\n\nChinese spotbill-In contrast to the teal and Eurasian wigeon, Chinese spotbills are a nonmigratory species (4) that resides year-round in the Poyang Lake region. We obtained 8871 total locations ( Table 1) . As expected, the Chinese spotbill ducks remained within Jiangxi Province throughout the spring (Fig. 3D ).\n\nWe examined waterfowl movements in relation to land cover, poultry density, and virus outbreaks within a rectangular study area bounded to the northeast at 55\u00b0N, 140\u00b0E and the southwest at 25\u00b0N, 110\u00b0E. We averaged the three BBUD isopleths for falcated teal, common and other small teal, and Eurasian wigeon to describe the East Asian Flyway pathway for wild ducks from Poyang Lake (Fig. 4) . Although the migratory corridor extended east to west across most of the Bohai Bay, there was a stopover region used by most ducks in China just north of Bohai Bay. We overlaid the overall BBUD migration pathway on a grid of poultry density and plotted the documented outbreak locations. The AIC analysis indicated that two models fit the data (Table 3) : these included the top-ranked model with covariates latitude+poultry density, and the second-ranked model with latitude+poultry density +BBUD. However, a comparative examination of each covariate's contribution to the model (Table 4 ) indicated that BBUD magnitude was only weakly and inversely related to the outbreak location (i.e., fewer wild bird locations where there were more outbreaks). Thus, we concluded that the top AIC ranked model (latitude+poultry density) was the single most parsimonious model in explaining variation in spatial outbreak locations.\n\nOutbreaks were positively correlated with poultry density and inversely correlated with latitude, indicating that greater frequencies of outbreaks occurred at lower latitudes and with higher poultry densities. When we examined outbreaks in relation to both latitude and date, most confirmed outbreaks occurred at latitudes less than 40\u00b0N, and outbreaks began by October before most ducks had reached nonbreeding areas in early November. The spring migration utilization distribution (Fig. 4) had a weak positive relationship with outbreaks, and the \u03c7 2 test indicated that utilization distribution was nonsignificant when compared with the null model ( Table 4 ). None of the land cover class covariates were helpful in explaining the occurrence of outbreak events.\n\nWhen we examined the outbreaks that occurred within the overall BBUD on a seasonal basis (Fig. 5) , we found that the number of observed and expected outbreaks differed by life-cycle period (G = 19.98, \u03c7 2 0.05,3 = 7.82, P < 0.001). Outbreaks occurred before many wild ducks had migrated to their nonbreeding areas (Fig. 5) . More outbreaks occurred than were expected during the fall (61-day period) and the nonbreeding period (121-day period), whereas fewer occurred during the breeding season (122-day period) and spring migration (61-day period; Fig. 6 ).\n\nIn total, 20 birds representing seven species were sampled for AIV, including Eurasian wigeon (n = 2), falcated teal (n = 6), common teal (n = 4), Baikal teal (n = 2), mallard (n = 1), garganey (n = 1), and Chinese spotbill (n = 4). The results of the sandwich ELISA and RT-PCR revealed that all 20 ducks were negative for type A influenza virus (Table 5) . However, the serology results of the indirect ELISA test for AIV H5 antibody indicated that the only mallard was positive (Table 5 ). These results indicate that no bird was actively infected by HPAI H5N1; however, the presence of antibody in the blood of the mallard suggested prior exposure to H5N1. All birds that we handled appeared clinically healthy and showed no obvious symptoms of influenza infection.\n\nOur ecological studies have been directed at improving understanding of the potential role of wild birds in the transmission of avian influenza. Prior to our satellite telemetry studies, little data were available on migratory movements of wild birds during the nonbreeding season at Poyang Lake, a region that has been suggested as an important source of HPAI H5N1 (6, 30) . Because sample size in satellite telemetry projects is limited by the cost of the technology along with battery life and performance, it is often difficult to generalize the sequential movements of individuals to broader migratory patterns of populations. However, application of the recently developed Brownian bridge movement model (21) allowed us to describe the flyway migration corridor in a probabilistic manner. As waterfowl demonstrate a high degree of seasonal fidelity to sites within and between years (1), we believe our BBUD analysis of spring 2007 migration tracks provided a reliable representation of the general migration route for the East Asian Flyway.\n\nWe predicted that spatial and temporal concordance of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks with wild duck movements should occur if wild ducks were directly involved in spread of the virus. Lack of correlation between the core flyway corridors of wild birds as indicated by the BBUD analysis and sites of reported outbreaks did not support this hypothesis (Table 3) . However, this type of spatial analysis depends on complete or representative reporting of outbreaks. If outbreaks are not fully reported, it could result in erroneous conclusions (22, 23) . Thus, our analysis highlights the importance of transparency in outbreak reporting to better understand the spread of disease. In addition, our analyses would have been improved with larger samples of the different species. By grouping species with different ecological characteristics, we may have missed individual differences in their movement patterns that may have been spatially correlated more closely to outbreaks.\n\nWe found no relationship among HPAI H5N1 outbreaks and land cover characteristics typically associated with waterfowl, such as water or wetland habitats (Table 3) . However, a biologically significant relationship between poultry density and sites of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks was detected (Table 4) , consistent with modeling studies of the virus in Southeast Asia (14) . The relationship of outbreaks with latitude ( Fig. 6 ) could stem from the higher density of poultry farms in southern, compared to northern China. In addition, the relationship of outbreaks to season (Fig. 6 ) may be due to the higher poultry stocking rates prior to Chinese New Year in January or February, a phenomenon that also governs the incidence of Newcastle disease (16) .\n\nOur examination of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in relation to stages in the annual life cycle of migratory birds suggests a temporal mismatch (Fig. 5) . Similar to earlier studies of whooper swans in the East Asian Flyway (26), we found fewer outbreaks than expected during the breeding season, when AIV prevalence typically reaches a maximum in wild bird populations (37) . Instead, the peak in observed outbreaks coincided with the nonbreeding season of migratory birds. During the breeding season, birds migrate to latitudes higher than 40\u00b0N (Fig. 6 ), precluding contact with poultry farms. However, the possibility exists that persistence of AIV H5 subtype particles in the environment (2) may be responsible for the lag between the breeding season and the peak in infections two months later. Our data also indicate that migration between nonbreeding and breeding areas is prolonged, with many intervening stopover sites. If AIV particles survive in the environment with increased residence time in colder climates (2) , wild birds may act as agents of transmission, \"seeding\" areas along their migration routes such as rice fields. Larger waterfowl such as geese may defecate as often as every 3.7 minutes (47) and therefore if infected have the potential to contaminate the environment with high loads of virus. Some duck species, such as the mallard, may shed virus for several days before the onset of clinical signs (25) , a period of time in which they could potentially travel several hundred kilometers assuming that the infection did not affect their movements (40) . Opportunities for poultry to acquire AIV shed by wild birds at Poyang Lake are created by the practice of herding domestic ducks onto the harvested rice fields to consume waste grains, as well as foraging in wetlands frequented by migratory birds.\n\nOur study identified that most ducks from Poyang Lake migrated across Bohai Bay, a body of water bordering Hebei Province in Northeast China. This area may represent a migratory \"thoroughfare\" of regional importance for several species of waterbirds such as whooper swans (32) , bar-tailed godwits (Limosa limosa) (15, 35) , and swan geese (author's unpublished data). Studies have identified sites that attract a diversity of wild bird species as important for interspecific transmission of low pathogenic avian influenza virus (7, 17, 18) . Similarly, the convergence of numerous waterbird species from different flyways at Bohai Bay may facilitate exchange of AIVs of different geographic origin. Regional migration stopover sites where wild bird species congregate and intermix are commonplace along other flyways, such as Qinghai Lake in the Central Asian Flyway. These high-density regional stopover areas may serve as catalysts for spread of disease in wild birds (27) , just as live poultry or \"wet\" markets facilitate transmission by bringing together multiple species of domestic fowl drawn from populations of different geographic regions (5, 42) .\n\nOur tracking results did not show any evidence of a migratory pathway for waterfowl between Poyang Lake in the East Asian Flyway and Qinghai Lake in the Central Asian Flyway (Fig. 1) , even when we included all 111 waterbirds marked with satellite transmitters in 2007-08 (author's unpublished data). In addition to the tracking data for eight species of migratory ducks from Poyang Lake, this included two species (bar-headed geese, ruddy shelduck) involved in the large 2005 outbreak at Qinghai Lake (6, 29) . Although most waterbirds migrate in a north-south direction, migration of some species may be east-west such as pochards (Aythya ferina) (1) and whooper swans (32) . It is possible that a larger sample of more species would result in detection of a migratory pathway connecting the East and Central Asian Flyways, but our tracking results to date indicate that, at best, it is not a commonly used route by waterfowl. Alternative possibilities for the movement of HPAI H5N1 from Poyang Lake to Qinghai Lake include that other species may follow that migration route, some species overlap at staging areas such as Dong Ting Lake to the west or Bohai Bay to the north and serve as relay agents, or migration routes from other regions might be involved. For example, our telemetry work in the Central Asian Flyway documented a previously unknown migration route connecting Qinghai Lake to a 2005 outbreak site in Mongolia (34) . Another alternative explanation is the trade of poultry or poultry products between these two wetlands. However, because poultry production is largely absent in this migration corridor and we found no connection between the flyways, the movement of HPAI H5N1 from the Poyang Lake and Qinghai Lake regions remains a mystery.
