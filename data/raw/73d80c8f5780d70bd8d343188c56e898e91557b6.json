Recently, the emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), first isolated in 2012 from a 60-year-old man in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, has highlighted the pathogenic potential of CoVs [1] . To date, MERS-CoV has caused 2,468 laboratoryconfirmed human infections worldwide, resulting in 851 deaths (case-fatality: 34.48%) [2] . However, human MERS-CoV originated in bats from where it transitioned into intermediate hosts such as . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

[19] . However, in contrast to other viruses such as influenza A, MERS-CoV fusion does not seem to depend on a pH change in the endosomes, as receptor binding in conjunction with proteolytic activation are sufficient to trigger fusion [20] . A more thorough description of the fusion pathways are summarized in several excellent reviews [20] [21] [22] [23] .\n\nA recent study on the FP of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) suggested that the FP region begins immediately downstream of the S2' cleavage site and that it can be separated into two distinct domains, FP1 and FP2 [24] . The authors showed that both FP1 and FP2 increase membrane ordering and proposed that FP1 and FP2 together form an extended FP which acts as a bipartite fusion platform. Intriguingly, both FP subdomains required calcium cations (Ca 2+ ) to exert their function in membrane entry and fusion. It was proposed that negatively charged aspartic acid (D) and glutamic acid (E) residues coordinate with the positively charged Ca 2+ within the fusion platform to promote greater membrane ordering. Furthermore, the authors showed that depletion of extracellular as well as intracellular Ca 2+ pools resulted in significantly reduced infectivity of SARS-CoV pseudo-particles, suggesting that both the plasma membrane and endosomal cell entry pathways are regulated by Ca 2+ .\n\nOther studies too have revealed an important role for Ca 2+ in the fusion dynamics of enveloped viruses.\n\nRubella virus (RuV), for example, requires Ca 2+ for virus entry and infection [25] . Ca 2+ is coordinated in between the two fusion loops of the RuV E1 fusion protein by asparagine (N) and aspartic acid and both residues were shown to be essential for virus viability. More recently, Ca 2+ was reported to enhance the entry of Ebola virus (EBOV) by directly interacting with the FP of the Ebola virus fusion protein [26] . The authors were able to identify two negatively charged residues (D522 and E540) in the FP that interact with Ca 2+ and this interaction is critical for viral fusion with the host cell.\n\nHere, we addressed the question whether Ca 2+ is required for viral entry and infectivity of MERS-CoV by creating a set of S protein mutants in which negatively charged residues in the FP were mutated to .

We used the different mutants in pseudo-particle infection assays to demonstrate that fusion of MERS-CoV is promoted but not dependent on Ca 2+ . Biophysical analysis demonstrated that Ca 2+ interactions with the MERS-CoV increases membrane ordering in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner. Our data suggests that a single glutamic acid residue in a region complementary to the SARS-CoV FP1 domain is involved in Ca 2+ coordination.\n\nIn order to test if Ca 2+ is required and which residues within the MERS-CoV FP are necessary for its coordination, we generated a set of mutated S proteins in which we substituted negatively charged aspartic acid and glutamic acid residues in the FP with alanine (A) ( Figure 1A ). We defined the FP region based on a sequence comparison with the SARS-CoV FP that was described previously [24] ( Figure 1A ).\n\nThe S mutant plasmids were generated via site-directed mutagenesis and verified by sequencing (data not shown). We next tested whether the mutated S proteins were expressed by transfecting the plasmid DNA into HEK 293T cells. Since the MERS-CoV S protein can be cleaved by constitutively expressed proteases during the maturation process, we added a protease inhibitor, dec-RVKR-CMK, immediately after transfection to block this cleavage. (Figure 2A ). Dec-RVKR-CMK was shown to inhibit a wide variety of proteases such as furin, cathepsins, trypsin, and TMPRSS2 to block S cleavage [15, 27] . As we wanted to confirm that the mutant S proteins are properly expressed and trafficked to the cell membrane surface, like the WT S protein, we isolated proteins 18 h post transfection via cell-surface biotinylation. Western blot analysis of the cell surface proteins showed that all mutant S proteins were expressed to similar levels as the MERS-CoV WT S protein ( Figure 2B ). With all mutant S proteins expressed, we next wanted to investigate whether the mutants exhibit the same cleavage pattern as WT S since proteolytic cleavage is an important and crucial trigger for viral fusion. We accomplished this by treating transfected cells with trypsin prior to protein isolation. Western blot analysis revealed that the cleavage pattern of the mutated .

Therefore, we co-expressed the S protein together with MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 in Vero cells for 18 h and visualized syncytia formation using an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Trypsin treatment of transfected cells was not required as the cells natively express proteases that cleave WT and mutated S proteins for cell-cell fusion. As a control, we added the protease inhibitor dec-RVKR-CMK to cells expressing WT S to prevent S cleavage and block MERS-CoV entry [27] . We analyzed the cells by fluorescence microscopy and quantified cell-cell fusion by counting the number of nuclei per syncytium. Cells expressing WT S exhibited strong syncytia formation with multiple nuclei and addition of dec-RVKR-CMK as a control efficiently prevented cell-cell fusion ( Figure 3A and B). Strikingly, in the absence of the inhibitor, the E891A and E891A/D892A mutants were impaired in their ability to trigger cell-cell fusion to the same extent as cells treated with dec-RVKR-CMK ( Figure 3A and B). However, since the cells expressing D892A formed syncytia similar to that of cells expressing WT S, this suggests that E891 is a critical residue for the fusogenic activity of MERS-CoV S and was responsible for the E891A/D892A mutant's inability to mediate cell-cell fusion. All other tested mutants showed attenuated cell-cell fusion at various degrees, however, none of the mutants was found to be as defective as the E891A S protein in mediating cell-cell fusion ( Figure 3A and B).\n\nThe cell-cell fusion results strongly suggest that E891 is an important residue for the fusogenic activity of MERS-CoV S. With the exception of D892, the data obtained for the other mutants indicate that they may play a minor role to trigger fusion. However, the mechanisms of cell-cell fusion and virus-cell fusion may .

Factors such as membrane curvature and/or density of viral S proteins may impact virus-cell fusion differently than cell-cell fusion [19] . Hence, the cell-cell fusion results provide an indication about the role of the individual D and E residues in the FP region, but need to be verified by viral infection of host cells. As MERS-CoV is a Risk Group 3 agent that needs to be handled in a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) setting, we employed a viral pseudotyping technique to generate pseudo-particles (PP) that serve as surrogates of native virions and are suitable for infection in a BSL-2 setting. These pseudoparticles consist of a murine leukemia virus (MLV) core and are decorated with their respective S glycoprotein so that they recapitulate the entry steps (binding and fusion) of the native virus [28] .\n\nFurthermore, the PP carry a genome encoding for luciferase, and upon successful infection of cells, the luciferase reporter is integrated in the host cell genome and drives luciferase production within the cell, which can be used to quantify the degree of infectivity. We generated PPs carrying the mutant S proteins and infected Huh-7 cells, a permissive cell line for MERS-Cov infection with high DPP4 expression [15] .\n\nAfter 72 h, the cells were lysed and briefly incubated with the luciferin substrate, which can be oxidized with cellular luciferase to produce luminescence. The measured relative luminescence values provide a quantitative read-out for the infectivity of each mutant S protein mediated infection.\n\nTo ensure that the infectivity of PPs carrying different S protein variants can be compared to each other, we performed a Western blot analysis to detect the amount of S that was incorporated into the PPs ( Figure   4 ). Because the cells were not treated with the protease inhibitor dec-RVKR-CMK, the S proteins were The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.18.881391 doi: bioRxiv preprint 8 full length and cleaved S proteins, for all S variants, we continued to analyze the infectivity of PPs carrying these mutated S proteins.\n\nIn agreement with the IFA observations, E891A and E891A/D892A PPs exhibited a five-fold reduction in the infectivity compared to the WT S PP, while D892A PP was not significantly different from WT S PP ( Figure 5A ). In addition, we also observed that infectivity of PPs carrying D911A was significantly lower than WT S PPs. However, infectivity was restored in the D911A/D912A double mutant ( Figure 5A ), suggesting that the D911 residue is not as critical for fusion as the D891 residue. If D911 was crucial for fusion, we would have expected the double mutant to display impaired infectivity as well. None of the other tested mutants exhibited significant differences compared to infections with WT S PPs ( Figure 5A ).\n\nD922A seemed to exhibit enhanced infection compared to the WT, but we did find it to be not statistically significant ( Figure 5B ).\n\nSARS-CoV was previously shown to depend on both extracellular and intracellular Ca 2+ pools for successful infection, and it is believed that this dependency is due to Ca 2+ interactions with the SARS-CoV FP [24] .\n\nBecause of the high sequence similarity between the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV FP, ( Figure 1A ) we were interested in determining if extracellular and/or intracellular Ca 2+ also plays a role in MERS-CoV fusion.\n\nOur analysis of the negatively charged residues in the MERS-CoV S FP region thus far suggest that E891 is a crucial residue for viral fusion, perhaps for coordinating with Ca 2+ . We are further interested in observing if the fusion behavior of E891 mutants would differ from that of WT in varying calcium concentration environments. Thus, we focused only on WT S and S proteins carrying the amino acid substitutions E891A, D892A, and E891A/D892A. Although the D911A expressed decreased infectivity, we did not proceed for reasons previously mentioned. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.18.881391 doi: bioRxiv preprint 9 that is only active intracellularly and does not significantly impact cell viability at this concentration [24, 29] . Chelating intracellular Ca 2+ resulted in a two-fold drop in infectivity of MERS-CoV WT PPs ( Figure   5C ). Infectivity was also reduced in the E891A and the D892A mutants. However, we did not detect a significant reduction of infectivity in the E891A/D892A double mutant when depleting intracellular Ca 2+ .\n\nWe next tested the impact of extracellular Ca 2+ on MERS-CoV fusion with the host cell membrane by incubating the cells with 150 \u00b5M of ethylene glycol-bis(\u03b2-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) prior to infection. Infectivity of MERS-CoV WT PPs was reduced by 25% when extracellular Ca 2+ was depleted ( Figure 5D ). There was no difference in infectivity with any of the PP carrying the mutated S proteins.\n\nThe results described above suggest that Ca 2+ promotes entry of MERS-CoV into the host cell, with a greater dependency on intracellular Ca 2+ concentration than extracellular Ca 2+ concentration. Since we hypothesized that E891 is a critical residue in Ca 2+ coordination, we would have expected its knockout variant, E891A, to have infectivity levels that are independent of Ca 2+ concentrations. However, the intracellular Ca 2+ studies show that single mutant E891A is impacted by Ca 2+ . A possible explanation for this apparent contradiction could be due to the FP flexibility. Perhaps if E891 is not available for Ca 2+ binding, the adjacent D892 can compensate for E891 and maintain Ca 2+ coordination in the FP. In support of this explanation is that the infectivity of the E891A/D892A double mutant is Ca 2+ independent, as both possible residues that can mediate Ca 2+ interactions have been knocked out. Thus, we believe that E891 does mediate Ca 2+ binding in the MERS-CoV FP1 region. However, previous studies with RuV and EBOV showed that two distinct opposing residues in the FP region are required to coordinate Ca 2+ [25, 26] , and so we proceeded to determine the other residues that Ca 2+ can coordinate with.\n\nMERS-CoV FP modeling suggests that there are two possible residues in the FP1 region that Ca 2+ can coordinate together with E891, namely D896 and D902 ( Figure 1B) . Therefore, we created MERS-CoV S . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

We confirmed that all three mutated proteins are expressed and trafficked to the plasma membrane in 293T cells as proteins were extracted by cell-surface biotinylation ( Figure 2C ). The IFA results show that cells expressing E891A/D896A, E891A/D902A, and E891A/D896A/D902A are impaired in their ability to form syncytia to a similar extent as the cells expressing WT S treated with dec-RVKR-CMK or the E891A single mutant ( Figure   3A and B). However, when we assessed protein incorporation into PPs, we found that WT and E891A/D896A PPs carried similar amounts of protein, but the protein incorporation in E891A/D902A and the E891A/D896A/D902A PPs was significantly reduced ( Figure 4 ). When cells were infected with PPs equipped with the S mutations, we found that infectivity of E891A/D896A was similar to the E891A single mutant ( Figure 6A ). Infectivity of E891A/D902A, however, was significantly lower compared to E891A and E891A/D896A. PPs carrying the E891A/D896A/D902A S protein were not infectious. These findings are consistent with the results of the PP Western blot analysis since they incorporate significantly less S protein, which most likely results in reduced entry. Depleting intracellular Ca 2+ levels using BAPTA-AM did not change infectivity of the tested PPs carrying S with the different amino acid substitutions ( Figure 6B ).\n\nWhen chelating extracellular Ca 2+ using EGTA, infectivity was also not altered in the mutants ( Figure 6C ).\n\nIn summary, our further mutant analysis to identify the second binding partner of Ca 2+ are inconclusive.\n\nThe data suggest that E896A is likely not the second binding partner because the E891A/D896A infectivity is similar to that of the E891A single mutant. However, due to poor incorporation of the E891A/D902A mutants into the PP, we are not able to compare their infectivity with the WT or E891A single mutants as those have higher amounts of S protein.\n\nWe used electron spin resonance (ESR) to examine the effect of MERS-CoV FP on membranes and to test whether membrane fusion of the peptide requires Ca 2+ . In this technique, spin labels are incorporated into lipids at various positions, acting as depth probes. Multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) containing .

The ordering parameter, S0, is an indication of the amount of membrane ordering at a given depth and serves as a readout for FP membrane penetration depth [30] [31] [32] . Changes in membrane ordering may reduce the energy barrier between two membranes and thus promote fusion [31, 33] . Previously studied FPs from different viruses induced membrane ordering illustrated as an S-shaped curve of S0 as a function of increasing FP to lipid (P/L) ratio while non-functional FPs and random peptides do not have a membraneordering effect and produce a scrambled signal [24, [30] [31] [32] 34] . Therefore, examining the membrane ordering effect of a peptide allows to determine whether it is a FP [24, 34] .\n\nAs shown in Figure 7A and B, MERS-CoV FP induced the greatest ordering effect of the head (DPPTC) and\n\nupper-tail (5PC) regions with 1 mM Ca 2+ . When we tested the deep hydrophobic region (14PC), no membrane ordering was observed (data not shown). When no Ca 2+ is supplemented and trace Ca 2+ is chelated with 1 mM EGTA at the same time, no such ordering effect is measured. This indicates that the function of the MERS-CoV FP is Ca 2+ dependent. Compared to the SARS-CoV FP, however, the MERS-CoV FP has a weaker effect. For DPPTC case, the maximal S0 for MERS-CoV FP is smaller (approx. 0.472) than that for SARS-CoV FP (approx. 0.479) at the highest P/L ratio in our experiment (5%). We fitted the S-shape curve using a four parameter logistic equation Y=S0,min+(S0,max-S0,min)/(1+(X-X0) p ), which is a built-in function of Origin (OriginLab), where the X0 is the P/L ratio (X) that induces half of maximal membrane order change (S0,max-S0,min), and p is the Hill's slope. The Hill's slope is an indicator for cooperativity in a ligandreceptor binding reaction. The X0 for SARS-CoV FP is 0.25% and for MERS-CoV FP is 0.61%, indicating the MERS-CoV FP is less effective than the SARS-CoV FP. The Hill's slope for SARS-CoV FP is 2.39 and for MERS-CoV FP is 1.44, indicating SARS-CoV FP induces membrane ordering in a more cooperative fashion then MERS-CoV FP at 1 mM Ca 2+ . The scrambled peptide shows no effect on membrane order. Although the . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

This method proved to be a solid approach to single out the effect of FP under the influence of Ca 2+ in a complex membrane-peptide-Ca 2+ system [24, 26] . As shown in indicating that Ca 2+ ions bind to the SARS-CoV FP more cooperatively than to MERS-CoV FP. For the SARS-CoV FP case, an explanation for this cooperativity is that the SARS-CoV FP has two Ca 2+ binding sites, and binding a Ca 2+ ion in one site will stabilize the secondary structure and help to bind another Ca 2+ ion in the other site. The lack of cooperativity in the case of the MERS-CoV FP suggests that it may have only one binding site.\n\nTo directly investigate the interaction between Ca 2+ and MERS-CoV FP, we used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). In this experiment, the synthetic MERS-CoV FP was added into the reaction cell at neutral buffer conditions (pH 7) and 1 ml CaCl2 (pH 7) was titrated into the cell dropwise. The heat flows generated by the reaction were recorded and the reaction heat for each injection (\u0394H) is calculated by . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

After the subtraction of dilution heat, which is measured by titrating 1 ml CaCl2 into the pH 7 buffer, the reaction heat between the Ca 2+ and the FP for each injection vs. the molar ratio of Ca 2+ to FP was plotted. As shown in Figure 7D , the reaction heats are positive, indicating the reaction is endothermic. The reaction heats decrease during the titration, indicating the FPs have been saturated by the Ca 2+ ions toward the end of the titration. The reason for the endothermic reaction may be due to the Na + ions interacting with the FPs were replaced by the Ca 2+ ions. The endothermic reactions were also observed when we injected CaCl2 into the SARS CoV FP in a similar experimental setup [24] . Fitting the data with the one-site model, which assumes all binding site(s) have the same binding affinity, we calculated the binding constant Kb=1.14\u00b10.23 \u00d7104 M -1 , the reaction enthalpy \u0394H= 3.12 \u00b1 0.45 kCal/Mol and the binding stoichiometry (Ca 2+ to the FP) n=1.12\u00b10.08. The stoichiometry of the Ca 2+ to the MERS-CoV FP is significantly different from that for the FP1_2 of SARS-CoV FP (n=1.7) and similar to FP1 or FP2 of the SARS-CoV FP (n=0.92 and 1.02, respectively) [24] . The results strongly support the hypothesis that the MERS-CoV FP only binds one Ca 2+ ion, while the SARS-CoV FP binds two, one on FP1 and one on FP2. The weaker Ca 2+ binding energies of the MERS-CoV FP is also consistent with the ESR results, which shows that the MERS-CoV FP induces a maximal membrane ordering effect in a higher Ca 2+ concentration than the SARS-CoV FP.\n\nViral entry into the host cell is one of the most critical steps in the life cycle of a virus. Enveloped viruses such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV utilize class I fusion proteins that facilitate binding to and fusion with the host cell membrane. A central factor that allows the viral and host membrane to merge is the FP within these proteins that is exposed upon proteolytic cleavage. Recently, reports demonstrated a crucial role for Ca 2+ in viral fusion, as it coordinates with negatively charged residues such as D and E within the FP.\n\nHere, we show that Ca 2+ promotes viral entry of MERS-CoV into the host cell. Of the investigated residues, E891 seems to be the major residue for Ca 2+ binding because the E891A substitution dramatically . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

We believe, however, due to the flexibility of the FP that the adjacent D892 residue can compensate for the loss of E891 because we observed attenuated infectivity in E891A when depleting intracellular Ca 2+ levels that was restored in the E891A/D892A mutant ( Figure   5C ). The shorter side chain of D at the 892 position may not establish a bond with Ca 2+ as strong as E and therefore the restoration of infectivity is only very minimal.\n\nOur attempts to identify the binding partner by generating double mutants of E891 with neighboring residues D896 and D902 were not successful as we observed poor S protein incorporation into the PPs. It is intriguing that the Western blots and cell-cell fusion results show that the E891A/D902A S mutants are properly expressed and trafficked to the cell membrane but are poorly integrated the virion surrogates.\n\nOne possible explanation is that these mutations impacts the integrity of the FP domain in a manner that hinders virion incorporation.\n\nThe role of Ca 2+ for viral fusion has been explored for other enveloped viruses such as RuV [25] , SARS-CoV [24] , EBOV [26] , human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) [35] and influenza A [24] . There seem to be significant differences regarding the role of Ca 2+ in mediating viral host cell membrane fusion. Studies showed that Ca 2+ does not bind to the FPs of influenza A or HIV-1 during the fusion event. Our prior observations of influenza fusion protein, which does not show increased membrane interaction in the presence of Ca 2+ [24] , indicate that Ca 2+ does not act as a blanket promoter of viral FP insertion into target membranes. [24] . In the case of HIV this leads to structural changes of the FP, which forms an \u03b1-helix in the absence of Ca 2+ , but changes conformation to an antiparallel \u03b2-sheet structure in the presence of Ca 2+ [35] . However, it is important to note, that while Ca 2+ enhances fusion for the above-mentioned viruses it is attenuated in its absence, but not abrogated. In contrast, Ca 2+ directly interacts with the FPs of RuV, SARS-CoV, and EBOV and depletion of Ca 2+ results in the incapability of the virus to fuse with the host cell [24] [25] [26] . For both RuV and EBOV, key residues within the FP were identified that coordinate with the Ca 2+ , and in concert with low pH, resulted in conformational changes of the FP and subsequent fusion. Here, . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

This could be due to the fact that the MERS-CoV FP binds only one Ca 2+ ion (which is discussed in greater detail below). On the opposite, host cell entry of SARS-CoV which binds two Ca 2+ in its FP region is entirely abrogated when depleting intracellular Ca 2+ levels [24] .\n\nGiven the high sequence similarity between the FP regions of the two viruses this finding implicates that the stoichiometry between FP and Ca 2+ has a significant impact on the fusion dynamics of the virus.\n\nCa 2+ , it could be argued that fusion of MERS-CoV is regulated by Ca 2+ to the membrane. We believe that we can rule out this possibility because our data obtained with the E891A mutant, the ESR and ITC provide good evidence that Ca 2+ interacts directly with the MERS-CoV FP.\n\nBy using ESR, we have demonstrated that the MERS-CoV FP also exerts a membrane ordering effect similar to that observed for SARS-CoV FP as well as for other viral FPs, which further strengthens our hypothesis that the membrane ordering effect is a required step for viral entry [24] . The membrane ordering effect is in turn serves as a useful biophysical indicator for examining the conditions required for the FP activity.\n\nUsing this method, we have previously demonstrated that SARS-CoV and EBOV FPs are Ca 2+ dependent, and now show the MERS-CoV FP is Ca 2+ dependent too. However, although the S-shaped curve of the MERS-CoV FP is similar to the SARS-CoV FP, MERS-CoV FP has a smaller membrane order effect than SARS-CoV FP and at 1.0 mM Ca 2+ , the membrane ordering effect is saturated by a higher P/L ratio of MERS-CoV FP than SARS-CoV FP ( Figure 7A and 7B) . By keeping the P/L ratio constant at 1%, the MERS-CoV FP is also saturated at a higher concentration of Ca 2+ (increase to half of its maximal at around 1.5 mM, compared to around 0.5 mM for SARS-CoV FP, Figure 7C ). Those results suggest that the MERS-CoV FP has a weaker interaction with Ca 2+ and thus require higher Ca 2+ concentration reach its maximal activity. This hypothesis .

The ITC experiments also demonstrate that the stoichiometry of Ca 2+ to the MERS-CoV FP is close to one (1.15) . This is different to the SARS-CoV case, in which SARS-CoV binds two Ca 2+ in its FP region, one in each FP1 and FP2 [24] . We interpret this to indicate that one Ca 2+ interacts with the MERS-CoV FP.\n\nThus, although the sequences of SARS and MERS-CoV FP are similar, they may interact with Ca 2+ differently. We believe that this interaction occurs in the MERS-CoV FP1 region as our data identified a residue in the FP1 region that interacts with Ca 2+ suggesting that this domain is important for Ca 2+ binding.\n\nNone of the tested mutants in the FP2 region provided clear evidence that Ca 2+ binding occurs in this domain, which is different from SARS-CoV FP. It is striking that despite the high sequence similarity between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV FP, there are significant differences in their FP Ca 2+ interactions. The ESR results indicate that the ordering effect is sequence specific. It is possible that the small difference in the sequence of the FP2 region of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is responsible for this difference in Ca 2+ interaction.\n\nWe show here that while SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV both functionally interact with Ca 2+ ions, there appear to be significant positional and stoichiometric differences between the two spike proteins. Prior mutagenesis experiments were carried out on the conserved E and D residues in the SARS-CoV FP1-2 region before the recognition of the bipartite nature of the FP and prior to any consideration of their potential for Ca 2+ interaction [36, 37] . The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.18.881391 doi: bioRxiv preprint unclear. Overall, these prior studies are in broad agreement with the interaction of Ca 2+ with only FP1 for MERS-CoV, compared to both FP1 and FP2 for SARS-CoV.\n\nIn the biological scenario, a possible explanation for the differences might be that Ca 2+ primes the FP for different steps in the host cell entry process. For SARS-CoV, extracellular Ca 2+ binding through the FP2 domain may prepare the fusion loop for subsequent intracellular Ca 2+ in the FP1. For MERS-CoV, the extracellular Ca 2+ binding step may not be required as none of the tested mutants in the FP2 region showed a striking reduction on infectivity whereas intracellular Ca 2+ depletion significantly reduced infectivity. Future studies will be designed to explore how swapping different residues or entire regions between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV FP would impact membrane fusion, entry pathways, and calcium interactions. It would be interesting to see if MERS-CoV will adopt SARS-CoV fusion behavior and vice versa. Different cell types, however, could also affect the fusion behavior of both viruses. Previous studies explored the fusion dynamics of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV PP using Vero E6 cells [24, 38] while we and others used Huh-7 cells to study MERS-CoV PP infections which exhibit a higher expression of furin and DPP4 and seem to promote entry mainly via the endocytic route [16, 39] . Addressing the impact of the cell type on the fusion dynamics of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV will complement our studies on the FP domains of the two viruses.\n\nHEK293T and Vero-E6 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Huh-7 cells were obtained from the Japan Health Science Research Resources Bank. All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Cellgro) supplemented with 25 mM HEPES (Cellgro) and 10% HyClone FetalClone II (GE) (cDMEM) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. The MERS-CoV S EMC/2012 gene was codon-optimized for mammalian expression and cloned into pDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen) as described previously [39] . The pCMV-MLV gag-pol murine leukemia virus (MLV) packaging construct, the pTG-Luc transfer vector encoding luciferase reporter and pCAGGS/VSV-G plasmid were described before [15, 40] .\n\nRecombinant L-1-Tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin was purchased from Sigma. The protease inhibitor dec-RVKR-CMK was obtained from Tocris. Calcium chelators BAPTA-AM and EGTA were purchased from Tocris and VWR, respectively.\n\nAll mutated MERS-CoV S constructs were generated by site directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.18.881391 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nVero cells were grown in microscopy chamber slides (Millipore) and transfected with the respective pCDNA3.1+/MERS-CoV S construct using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Transfections were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. 18 h post transfection, the immunofluorescence assay was carried out as previously described with the exception that membranes were not permeabilized with TritonX-100 (Millet PNAS). The MERS-CoV S protein was detected using the same antibodies as described for the western blot analysis. For quantification, images of at least five randomly selected fields were acquire. The nuclei of nine syncytia for each condition were counted manually to calculate the average nuclei/syncytia. Average and standard deviation were calculated using Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism 7. Data was visualized using GraphPad Prism 7.\n\nProduction of and infection with pseudo-particles (PPs) was performed as previously described with minor modifications [28] . In brief, PPs of each individual construct were produced by transfecting HEK293T cells with 600 \u00b5g of the respective plasmid DNA, 600 \u00b5g pTG-Luc and 800 \u00b5g pCMV-MLVgag-pol using PEI as described above. 48 h post transfection, the supernatants were harvested, centrifuged at 290 x g for 7 minutes to remove cell debris, filtered through a 0.45 \u00b5m syringe filter and stored at -80\u00b0C in small aliquots. For infection assays, Huh-7 cells were seeded in 24-well plates. Cells were washed with 500 \u00b5L PBS and 200 \u00b5L PPs were added and incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 with rocking. After 2 h, the cells were supplemented with 300 \u00b5L cDMEM medium and incubated for 72 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Cells were then lysed, and luciferase activity was measured using a Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega). Readings were performed with a Glomax 20/20 system (Promega). For each experiment, three technical replicates were prepared. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism 7. To chelate extracellular calcium, cells were pre-incubated with 200 uL of DMEM-(2% Hyclone, 10 mM HEPES) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. After 1 h, DMEM-was aspirated and cells were infected with 200 \u00b5L PP containing 50 uM EGTA for 2 h 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2with rocking. Analysis of infected cells is as described above. Negative controls were controls were conducted by pre-incubating the cells in DMEM+ and infecting with PP without treatment. For Western Blot analysis of the incorporated S protein 1 ml of harvested PP were spun down at 43000 x g for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was aspirated, and protein pellet was resuspended in 2x Laemmli buffer. All protein was loaded on a SDS-PAGE gel and Western blot analysis was carried out as described above.\n\nThe structure of the MERS-CoV S protein was downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Accession Number 5X5C, DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2210/pdb5X5C/pdb) [42, 43] . Modelling was performed as described previously using Chimera software (Chimera version 1.14, University of California) [44, 45] .\n\nImage was created using Adobe Illustrator CC 22.1.\n\nThe lipids POPC, POPS, and the chain spin labels 5PC, 10PC and 14PC and a head group spin label dipalmitoylphospatidyl-tempo-choline (DPPTC) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) or synthesized by our laboratory according to previous protocols. Cholesterol was purchased from Sigma and its corresponding shuffle peptide are the same as in [24] .\n\nThe composition of membranes used in this study is consistent with our previous study [24] . \n\nTo prepare the samples for lipid ESR study, the desired amounts of FPs (1 mg/mL) were added into the lipid MLVs dispersion. After 20 min of incubation, the dispersion was spun at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The concentrations of peptide were measured using UV to ensure complete binding of peptide. The pellet was transferred to a quartz capillary tube for ESR measurement. ESR spectra were collected on an ELEXSYS . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

The fitting strategy is described below. We employed the Budil et al. NLLS fitting program [46] to obtain convergence to optimum parameters. The g-tensor and A-tensor parameters used in the simulations were determined from rigid limit spectra [24] . The ordering tensor parameters, S0 and S2, were extracted from the spectra, which are defined as follows: S0=<D2,00>=<1/2(3cos2\u03b8\u22121)>, and S2=<D2,02+D2,0-2> =<\u221a(3/2)sin2\u03b8cos2\u03c6>, where D2,00, D2,02, and D2,0-2 are the Wigner rotation matrix elements and \u03b8 and \u03c6 are the polar and azimuthal angles for the orientation of the rotating axes of the nitroxide bonded to the lipid relative to the director of the bilayer, i.e. the preferential orientation of lipid molecules; the angular brackets imply ensemble averaging. S0 and its uncertainty were then calculated in well-known fashion from its definition and the dimensionless ordering potentials C20 and C22 and their uncertainties found in the fitting. The typical uncertainties we find for S0 range from 1-5 \u00d7 10 -3 , while the uncertainties from repeated experiments are 5-8 \u00d7 10 -3 or less than \u00b10.01. S0 indicates how strongly the chain segment to which the nitroxide is attached is aligned along the normal to the lipid bilayer, which is strongly correlated with hydration/dehydration of the lipid bilayers [31, 47] .\n\nBudil DE, Sanghyuk L, Saxena S, Freed JH.
