Kuijper\u00b0(Leiden, NL) Since the 1980s the epidemiology of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has been investigated by the application of many different typing or fingerprinting methods. To study the epidemiology of CDI, a typing method with a high discriminatory power, typeability, stability, power, reproducibility and epidemiological concordance is required. It should also have technical advantages, such as ease of performance, relative low cost, and high throughput. A growing number of molecular methods have been applied to C. difficile. For the early and rapid detection of outbreak situations, methods such as restriction enzyme analysis, arbitrary primed polymerase chain reaction (PCR), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and PCR ribotyping are commonly used. For long-term epidemiology, multilocus sequence typing, multilocus variable number of tandem repeats analysis (MLVA), and amplified fragment length polymorphism are of interest. Currently, the PCR-ribotyping method and the library of PCR ribotypes in Cardiff are the benchmarks to which most typing studies around the world are compared. Conventional agarose gel-based PCR ribotyping is easy to use and relatively cheap, but analysis of fragment lengths is hampered by poor resolution. Recently, a capillary gel electrophoresisbased PCR ribotyping assay has been developed that significantly reduces the hands-on time required for C. difficile PCR ribotyping. The results were highly reproducible, independent of reagent batches or brands used and allows inter-laboratory comparisons of typing results. The analysis of the sequenced C. difficile genome revealed a high percentage of DNA that consisted of a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR). Recently, a new MLVA method was developed using smal short tandem repeats (2\u22129 bp) to facilitate automated fragment analysis with multicoloured capillary electrophoresis instead of sequencing. In a study using isolates from laboratories in Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States, seven C. difficile typing techniques were compared, but only REA and MLVA showed sufficient discrimination to distinguish strains from different outbreaks. MLVA has also been applied to study local outbreaks of C. difficile PCR ribotype 027 strains. MLVA is currently the most discriminative typing method and will contribute significantly to our understanding of the epidemiology of C. difficile.\n\nThe need for new therapeutic alternatives in CDI is clear. Current recurrence rates are unacceptably high. The optimal treatment of severe CDI, infection caused by strains associated with poor outcome (e.g. C. difficile ribotype 027), and multiple recurrences is unclear. There are several potentially promising new CDI treatment approaches under investigation, including antibiotic, anti-toxin and bacterial interference options. Probiotic therapy remains of unproven benefit. As new options become available, prognostic data will be needed to guide on the most approriate therapeutic choices.\n\nS. Dial\u00b0 (Montreal, CA) Clostridium difficile has long been recognised as important cause of antibiotic associated diarrhoea in hospitalised patients. Although community associated disease has been described in the 80's, it is only in this decade that it has been recognised as an important cause of infectious diarrhoea in patients in the community. As C. difficile was mostly recognised as a nosocomial pathogen, the majority of studies of clinical C. difficile infections (CDI) have been conducted in acute care hospitals, and many have been performed during outbreak situations. The hospital environment has very specific characteristics which are likely to be important determinants of infectious disease occurrence and transmission, such as clustering of susceptible hosts, increased possibility of environmental contamination, physical proximity and multiple person to person contacts. Similarly, the demographics of hospitalized patients population also differ significantly from that of the community. In hospitals, the prevalence of antibiotic use is very high, and highly correlated with many other factors which could be important in the expression of CDI. Until recently antibiotics were believed to be a prerequisite for the development of CDI but studies of community acquired disease are consistently describing disease occurring in a high proportion of patients who have no such exposure. This has lead to research examining other risk factors. CDI appears to be increasing in the community especially in the elderly, but also in the pediatric population. As up to 50% of CDI in the community may not be precceded by recent antibiotic exposure particularly in patients without a recent hospitalization, many of the recommended diarrhea testing alogarithms will result in this diagnosis being missed or delayed. This could have important implications for patient care and control of outbreaks. Well designed studies of C. difficile in the community could improve our understanding of this disease and improve the ability to explore other risk factors and where antibiotic exposure maybe less confounded.\n\nextended cohort (n = 147). Finally (stage 3), the observed associations were tested for replication in an independent case-control study (n = 146) . Results: In stage 1, we found SNPs in the genes for MASP2, CD14, LBP and TLR6 to be associated with increased susceptibility to meningococcal disease. For the rs2563298 SNP in CD14 this was replicated in the case control study (stage 2; OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.17-2.31) and in the separate replication study with the independent (confirmatory) cohort (Stage 3; OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.02-2.04). Subgroup analysis showed that the CD14 SNP conferred increased risk only in shock patients (OR 1.99, ). This CD14 SNP is functional and leads to decreased IL-10 and IL-12 production in a whole blood model of meningococcal sepsis.\n\nIn conclusion, we identified a functional SNP in CD14 that is associated with an increased risk for meningococcal septic shock. Possible other SNPs associated with increased risk for meningococcal disease were in MASP2, LBP and TLR6.\n\nChromatin is made-up of DNA, histones and non-histones proteins. Covalent modifications of histones through acetylation at Lysine residues strongly influence the structure and the function of the chromatin. Whereas acetylation of histones results in a relaxed chromatin structure that is associated with active transcription, de-acetylation of histones results in a compacted chromatin structure associated with repressed transcription. Global histone acetylation is regulated by the opposing actions of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Beside histones, non histones proteins are modified by reversible acetylation, among which a-tubulin, HSP90 and transcription regulators. Therefore, HDACs impact on many biological functions, primarily cell differentiation, growth and survival. HDAC inhibitors (HDIs) were originally developed for their powerful anti-cancer activity. Yet, recent preclinical studies suggest that HDIs possess antiinflammatory activity. Based on these observations, we postulated that HDIs could impact on innate immune response to microbial infection. Here we will discuss the results from our studies on the effect of HDIs on the innate immune system. We first performed genome-wide gene expression analyses to have a global view of the impact of HDIs on the transcriptome of resting and microbial product-stimulated primary macrophages. We then studied the influence of HDIs on key parameters (activation of the intracellular signal transduction pathways, production of cytokines and chemokines, expression of co-stimulatory and chemokine receptors..) of macrophages, dendritic cells and whole blood activated by a broad range of microbial products. Finally, we analyzed the impact of HDIs in preclinical models of non-severe bacterial and fungal infections, toxic shock and severe sepsis.\n\nOverall, these studies demonstrate that HDIs are powerful antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs that impair innate immune responses to microbial infections in vitro and in vivo. While the results suggest that HDIs may represent attractive adjunctive therapies to treat pathological situations characterized by dysregulated inflammatory responses such as autoimmune diseases and severe sepsis, they also warn that HDIs may increase the risk of developing opportunistic infections and sepsis, especially in immunocompromised cancer patients.\n\nLatest trends from the molecular laboratory for studying fungal pathogens and invasive fungal infections S14 Diagnostic PCR for IFI. Does it really work?\n\nInvasive aspergillosis (IA) continues to have high mortality, partly as a consequence of the difficulties of early diagnosis and also due to therapeutic limitations. Nowadays IA diagnosis is based on extensive use of galactomannan (GM) and high-resolution chest tomography (HRCT). Despite the fact positive GM has prompted an earlier treatment of IA, mortality is still high in this population showing that other diagnostic approaches should be taken into account. Detection of nucleic acids, PCR-based methods mainly, appears to be an option to assess although to date there are many doubts as to the profitability of this type of methods. Diagnostic PCR must be considered an additional test that is being developed and that is used in some reference laboratories. Its lack of standardization should be stressed, since different laboratories use different approaches in terms of extraction, probes, primers, PCR conditions, and measurement. Furthermore the benefit of detecting DNA of Aspergillus fumigatus depends on the clinical sample used. PCR techniques have shown high diagnostic reliability in tissue biopsies and respiratory samples with high negative predictive values and discreet positive predictive values, but lower diagnostic reliability has been obtained in blood samples. Those high negative predictive values could be useful to rule out the presence of infection. Newer approaches such as serial determinations of Aspergillus DNA in serum or blood, and detection of fungal DNA in higher volumes of blood have shown a greater diagnostic applicability, which increases when combined with GM quantification and high-resolution chest tomography. Those approaches have had higher rates of both sensitivity and specificity and improved the early diagnosis of aspergillosis.\n\nFewer data are available for other mycoses. PCR methods have been developed to detect Candida, endemic mycosis and emerging pathogens but more data are needed and reliable conclusions should not be drawn.\n\nT. Boekhout\u00b0, F. Hagen, B. Theelen, K. Khayhan, C. Klaassen, J. Meis (Utrecht, Nijmegen, NL) Our understanding of causative agents of fungal diseases has changed considerably during recent years. This is mainly due to the large scale introduction of molecular studies, in which one or more stretches of DNA are compared across a wide range of fungi, including human and animal pathogens. One of the most striking discoveries was the recognition of Pneumocystis as a fungus, as this organism was considered previously to belong to the parasites. In many cases traditional 'species' turned out to represent species complexes and many of the newly recognized clinically relevant species may differ in the susceptibility to commonly used antifungals. Therefore, correct identification of these new pathogens is important for proper patient management. A brief overview will be presented of these developments in fungal taxonomy and their implications for the clinical practice. Examples will be given from the main lineages of the fungal kingdom, namely Zygomycetes, Ascomycetes (Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Candida spp.) and Basidiomycetes (Malassezia, Trichosporon and Cryptococcus spp.). Due to our own experience with the basidiomycetous yeasts we will give more in depth information on these fungi. The number of recognized species is rapidly increasing due to the application of molecular systematics and the availability of a large database of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences, most notable the D1/D2 domains of the LSU rDNA and the ITS 1 and 2 regions. Only a few species are generally recognized as important pathogens for humans and animals, including Cryptococcus neoformans and Cr. gattii, several Trichosporon species and Malassezia spp. However, several non-conventional basidiomycetous yeast species can cause infection or are otherwise involved in health problems, such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis. We will present data on the involvement of these emerging basidiomycetous species, such as C. adeliensis, C. diffluens, C. flavescens and C. laurentii in human diseases. Emphasis will be on the Cr. neoformans-Cr. gattii and Malassezia species complexes, especially the role of the newly recognized species in disease, virulence, and susceptibility to antifungals.\n\nS. Bretagne\u00b0 (Cr\u00e9teil, FR) The main application of genotyping is for the investigation of epidemics or tracking routes of contamination. Several molecular typing techniques have been developed for fungi. Ideally, typing results should be accurate, reproducible, and easy to interpret. Importantly, methods should be transferable to other settings. Many typing methods such as randomly amplified polymorphic DNA, restriction fragment length polymorphism, single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, and amplified fragment length polymorphism yield fingerprint profiles that are difficult to reproduce in different settings. In contrast, two methods have emerged for clinical applications as providing reliable, portable and easy to obtain data: microsatellite markers and Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST). Microsatellites, or short tandem repeats, are defined as tandemly repetitive stretches of two to five nucleotides. After amplification, PCR products are analyzed based on amplicon length. The present limitation of microsatellite typing is transferability. A straightforward and universally applicable method to achieve such a calibration is through the use of allelic ladders. MLST is based on sequencing several housekeeping genes. Active MLST schemes are publicly available (http://www.mlst.net/) for yeasts. The main advantage of MLST is the ability to provide indisputable data based on sequencing. However, MLST is laborious, based on the quality of the sequences, has a long turn-around time and is associated with significant costs. The nosocomial acquisition of invasive infections has been investigated. The conclusion are disappointing for invasive aspergillosis but unambiguous for invasive candidiasis. However, genotyping itself is not sufficient. Sampling, collection of clinical and epidemiological data are compulsory to reach a meaningful conclusion. Another interesting point is the propagation of a given clone with a resistant phenotype. This has already been investigated for Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida tropicalis.\n\nGetting more and more pieces of information on the genome of each microorganism will probably be part of the future routine laboratories. The current trend towards mass sequencing creates such opportunities. This technology might lead to several modifications in the way we identify a species or characterize an isolate.\n\nThe introduction of the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has profoundly influenced the course of HIV infection, improving the survival of HIV infected patients and reducing HIV-associated opportunistic infections. Nevertheless, long-term outcomes secondary to HIV infection are now serious concerns, like non-infectious cardiovascular complications including cardiomegaly, pericarditis, myocarditis and pulmonary arterial hypertension. The lung is the most frequent target organ for disorders associated with HIV infection, and the cardiopulmonary vascular system can be sometimes involved; indeed, HIV-related pulmonary arterial hypertension (HRPAH) affects more HIV-infected individuals (i.e. 0.5%) than uninfected (i.e., 1 to 2 cases per million people). The average age of HRPAH patients is 33 years, although the range can span from infancy to old age. There is no trend between HRPAH and HIV viral loads or CD4+ T cell counts but is more severe in AIDS patients. Shortness of breath is the most common symptom, and a clinical, cardiological, radiological work up is required for diagnosis. Cardiac catheterisation is the gold standard for the final diagnosis, and is mandatory to characterize the disease and exclude secondary causes.\n\nThere is no definitive evidence of HIV as a causal agent for HRPAH. However, viral proteins and its interactions with molecular partners in the infected host are strong candidates for cause-effect relationships because they may promote apoptosis, growth and proliferation. At least three of the HIV proteins are implicated in the pathology of PAH: the HIV envelope glycoprotein-120 (Env), the HIV protein Tat and HIV Nef (negative factor). Nef impairs vasomotor functions in pulmonary artery cells, decreases the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and increases oxidative stress, suggesting a strong role in the formation of plexiform lesions in the lung vasculature. The role of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HRPAH is still debated. From a literature review, survival rates are 69% and 38% among patients treated or not with ART and specific therapy for PAH, respectively (p = 0.02), thus suggesting that specific therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension should be strongly recommended in these patients. The role of the combination treatment with antiretrovirals in influencing the outcome of HRPAH is controversial, even if some evidences seem to indicate a beneficial effect in the clinical course of the disease. In fat only a few samples could be successfully analysed. These showed a mean of 6.0 [mg/g] in group I (evaluable samples only for two patients), a mean of 1.9 [mg/ml] in group II (evaluable samples only for three patients); for group III the samples of all six patients were below the detection limit of the analytical method. In a linear regression analysis the decrease of serum daptomycin concentration per minute was estimated as \u22120.230, 95% confidence interval ( \n\nObjectives: Higher vancomycin (VAN) serum trough levels (STL) have been recommended when MRSA HAP is suspected. However, the correlation between VAN STL and clinical outcomes and safety is still poorly understood. Methods: ATTAIN 1 and 2 were randomized, methodologically identical, double-blind, phase 3, clinical trials in patients with hospitalacquired pneumonia (HAP). We analyzed baseline characteristics and outcomes from patients with S. aureus (SA) randomized to VAN (1 g IV q12 h; 7 to 21 days) as a function of median VAN STL. VAN could be adjusted for renal function and/or institutional policies. The all-treated (AT) population included randomized patients who received 1 dose of study medication. This analysis was limited to the subset of SA-infected patients with VAN STL. Results: 98 VAN AT patients with S aureus had STL (Table) .\n\nMedian VAN Trough Level (mg/ml) <10 (n = 30) 10 to <15 (n = 33) 15 (n = 35) p-value [1] Number of trough values per patient (median, range) [4] 0.5 mg/mL 2/9 (22%) 1/6 (17%) 1/4 (25%) 1.000 (chi) 1.0 mg/mL 7/9 (78%) 5/6 (83%) 3/4 (75%) Clinical response of \"cure\" 21 (VISA) has been previously reported to result in cell wall remodeling and antimicrobial susceptibility changes in favor of b-lactam activity. We evaluated the activity of VAN, oxacillin (OXA) and cefoxitin (CFX) and the potential for synergy of the combination of VAN+OXA against a collection of clinical heterogenous VISA (hVISA) and VISA strains.

Torresi (Melbourne, AU; Lyon, FR; Zurich, CH) Objective: To estimate the incidence density of influenza, dengue and Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Australian travellers to Asia. Methods: Prospective cohort study of Australian travellers to South and South East Asia over a 2 year period. Travellers 16 years of age were recruited from 3 travel clinics, completed validated questionnaires and provided pre and post-travel blood samples for serological testing. Demographic data, destinations and travel patterns, vaccination details and history of flavivirus infection were obtained. Serological testing for dengue IgG by ELISA (Pan-Bio assay), Influenza A and B (complement fixation antibody) and JE (In-house indirect fluorescence antibody) was performed.\n\nResults: Among 450 travellers enrolled, 345 have returned for followup, 53 (11.7%) have been lost to follow-up and paired sera have been tested for 324 travellers; 58% were female, median age was 32 years and 24% were born overseas. 72% were short term travellers (<30 days) and main traveller types were vacation/holiday goers (69%) and business travellers (16%). 76% reported prior travel to Asia and 10.8% and 54% had received the JE and influenza vaccines respectively. Dengue sero-prevalence: Acute seroconversion for dengue virus infection was demonstrated in 4/324 (1.2%) of travellers tested. This translates to an incidence of 4.17 dengue virus infections per 10,000 days of travel (95% CI 1.7-10.7). A further 13 travellers (4%) were positive for dengue IgG prior to travel indicating past exposure. Travellers with acute dengue infection had travelled to China (n = 2) India (n = 1) and Thailand (n = 1), and two of these travellers had received the JE vaccine. Influenza seroprevalence: 4/324 (1.2%) had evidence of recent influenza infection. The incidence of influenza virus infections is 4.17 per 10,000 days of travel (95% CI 1.7-10.7). JE sero-prevalence: There was no acute JE seroconversion in this cohort. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the largest prospective study estimating the incidence of both respiratory and arboviral infections in travellers. For travellers to Asia, the risk of acquiring dengue in an inter-epidemic period is low (incidence density 4.17 infections per 10,000 days of travel). The risk of acquiring influenza in this well vaccinated cohort was equally as low and no JE infections were observed. These findings have important implications for practitioners advising prospective travellers.\n\nC.R. Stensvold\u00b0, M. Lebbad (Copenhagen, DK; Solna, SE) Objective: Diagnosis of intestinal protists by PCR is being employed more and more by diagnostic and research laboratories. Data from molecular characterisation of intestinal protists is the raw material for our current and future efforts to develop improved diagnostic PCRs. Apart from our ability to sample correctly and extract DNA from parasites directly from faeces, important issues include primer specificity and sensitivity, which have impact on predictive values of the diagnostic assays. Thus, it is important to be aware of the genetic diversity among these parasites. Extensive data from the molecular characterisation of intestinal protists are necessary if PCR-based diagnosis is to detect all genetic variants of intestinal parasites especially if the eventual aim is for it to substitute for morphology-based methods. Diagnostic PCRs are very often based on amplification of the Small Subunit (SSU) rRNA gene, partly due to the fact that this gene is present in a high-copy number. However, data from very few strains are currently available for the SSU rRNA gene of most intestinal parasites. Often only one or two sequences are available in the Genbank database.\n\nWe are in the process of collecting data from the genetic characterisation of protozoa such as Iodamoeba, Entamoeba coli, Entamoeba hartmanni and Entamoeba polecki-like organisms isolated from clinical samples. Knowing the amount of diversity displayed among clinical isolates of these (and other) parasites will help us generate specific and sensitive primers that can be used in cases where a definitive diagnosis cannot be established on the basis of microscopy. Preliminary results show that the genetic diversity within Entamoeba coli is extensive, and that no less than four genetic subtypes of uninucleate amoebic cysts can be isolated from human faeces. We have also obtained genetic data from protozoan genera that have not been sequenced before. Conclusion: If future platforms for the diagnosis of intestinal protists are to rely on PCR, comprehensive data from molecular characterisation of these organisms are needed to design, evaluate, validate and optimise PCR protocols.\n\nE. Asadollahy, P. O'Neill\u00b0(Ilam, IR; Liverpool, UK) Objectives: Resistance to chloroquine (CQ) in Plasmodium falciparum malaria has become a major health concern of the developing world. This resistance has prompted a re-examination of the pharmacology of alternative antimalarials that may be effective against resistant strains. Amodiaquine (AQ) is a 4-aminoquinoline antimalarial which is effective against many chloroquine-resistant strains of P. falciparum. However, clinical use of AQ has been severely restricted because of associations with hepatotoxicity and agranulocytosis. Based on a knowledge of the metabolic basis of amodiaquine toxicity, the aim of this study was to examine the effects of replacing the 4 OH function of amodiaquine with fluorine.\n\nA successful four-step synthesis of a new series of 4 -fluoro analogues has been designed and applied to the synthesis of an array of 10 analogues. Malaria parasites were maintained in continuous culture using the method of Jensen and Trager. Antimalarial activity was assessed with an adaption of the 48-h sensitivity assay of Desjardins et al.. using [3H]-hypoxanthine incorporation as an assessment of parasite growth.\n\nThe chemistry in the 4 fluoro series provided the target compounds in higher overall yields. Initial testing on both series of analogues was carried out on a chloroquine sensitive (3D7) and resistant strains TM6, K1, TM4, V1S and J164 at the Liverpool School of Tropical. It is apparent that several analogues have potent antimalarial activity against sensitive 3D7 strain of the parasite. The data indicates that 6 h is superior to the pyrollidino analogue 6b against all of the strains examined. It is also clear that N-tert butyl analogue 6b is potent against chloroquine resistant strains, though it is not quite as active as amodiaquine (AQ) against both chloroquine senstitive and resistant parasites. Conclusion: In summary, work conducted in this study has identified several potent back-up compounds to the clinical candidate. It is clear that the 4 fluoro series has several members with potent activity compared to amodiaquine. It has been shown that (6 h) has is slightly less potent than amodiaquine, chloroquine and the clinical candidate (4b). Further studies on the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of 6 h are necessary.\n\nM. Al-Mashhadani, R. Hewson\u00b0, R. Vivancos, A. Keenan, N. Beeching, J. Wain, C. Parry (Liverpool, Colindale, London, UK) Objectives: Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) causes gastroenteritis and can lead to serious invasive illness and death. Many cases of NTS go untreated as they cause a mild illness. In more serious cases treatment is required and the fluoroquinolones are often the drug of choice. Isolates with decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (DCS), which is usually associated with resistance to nalidixic acid (NA), are on the increase. It has been suggested that foreign travel is a risk factor for the acquisition of Salmonella enterica isolates with NA resistance and DCS. This study aims to investigate the link between foreign travel and NA resistant/DCS isolates in Liverpool. \n\nCarbapenem resistant Acinetobacter represent a major threat to our antibiotic armamentarium. In general, Class B and D b-lactamases form the basis for this phenotype. Class D b-lactamases are serine enzymes that are either monomers or dimers that possess unique structural motifs. By utilizing a carbamylated Lysine, a distinctive complex hydrogen-bonding network is created to fix the b-lactam in the substrate-binding pocket and assist in binding, acylation and deacylation. As a result of substitutions accelerated by b-lactam use, many class D enzymes emerged that possess functional and structural properties which confer a selective advantage to the bacterium housing the carbapenem hydrolyzing b-lactamase. Important carbapenemases in Acinetobacter include: bla OXA-23 , bla , bla , bla OXA-58 , bla . With these notions in mind, our purpose will be to i) review the molecular epidemiology and genetics of the major class D serine carbapenemases that are present in Acinetobacter spp; ii) analyze how amino acid changes have altered substrate specificity by using select examples; and iii) highlight changes in the expression of efflux pumps and outer membrane proteins in the amplification of carbapenem resistance. The crystal structures of important class D enzymes will be reviewed and analyzed.\n\nIn recent decades Pseudomonas aeruginosa has emerged as a major threat as a result of the significant mortality associated with pneumonia and bacteraemia, and the evolving resistance exhibited by the pathogen to numerous antibacterials. Since a timely and appropriate therapy is needed for severe P aeruginosa infections, clinicians should be aware of the risk factors associated with this pathogen and with multidrug resistance. There is still debate if a combination or a monotherapy should be instituted for Ps. aeruginosa infections. The use of combination therapies for Ps. aeruginosa pneumonia has been a long-advocated practice, but the potential increased value of New horizons in the diagnosis of bacterial sepsis S13 combination therapy over monotherapy remains controversial. However, empirical combination therapy maximizes the chances of bacterial coverage, especially in severe infections, and likely exerts a lower resistance selection pressure. Upon confirmation of Ps. aeruginosa infection, treatment should be given according to the site of infection, the pathophysiology of the patient, the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile of the antimicrobials, and the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern, including the MIC values. For strains that are resistant to all antimicrobials but colistin, this antimicrobial is advocated as the choice option either in mono-or in combination therapy. Indeed, since there are no novel antibiotics in the drug development pipeline for multidrug-resistant Ps. aeruginosa, old antibiotics, such as the polymyxins (ie, colistin, also known as polymyxin E and polymyxin B), have re-emerged as the last resort therapy. However, current clinical use of colistin is largely informed by inadequate and, in some cases inaccurate, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data. Rifampin, sulbactam, carbapenems, fosfomycin are all possible options for combination treatment, due to their in vitro synergistic effect. Among carbapenems, doripenem seems to possess a lower potential for resistance selection and a more favourable pharmacokinetic profile. Newer anti-pseudomonal antibacterials are expected to be available in the near future. Among them, experimental polypeptides (i.e. the anti-PcrV immunoglobulin G antibody) may provide a new therapeutic approach.\n\nJ. Rodr\u00edguez-Ba\u00f1o\u00b0(Seville, ES) Carbapenems are considered the drugs of choice for the treatment of serious infections caused by ESBL-producing enterobacteria. However, alternatives are needed because carbapenem-resistance due to carbapenemases and other mechanisms are increasing worldwide. For the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis due to ESBL producers, observational studies showed high cure rates with oral fosfomycin, nitrofurantoine, and amoxicillin-clavulatane when a susceptible isolate was involved. Mecillinam, which is stable against ESBLs, is also a potential option. For patients with other types of infections including complicated urinary tract infections, the options are more limited. Some isolates may show low MIC to specific cephalosporins depending on the type of ESBL produced; PK/PD data suggest that these infections can be treated with these cephalosporins (particularly cefepime) using appropriate doses, but this practice is not recommended for empirical therapy because the MIC cannot be predicted. Adding an aminoglycoside to a standard regimen is a reasonable option for selected patients at low risk of renal toxicity in areas where prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance among ESBLproducers is low. The efficacy of combinations of cephalosporins with b-lactamase inhibitors (as cefoperazone-sulbactam, or as the combination of a cephalosporin and amoxicillin/clavulatane) and temocillin are to be studied in different clinical settings. However, the worldwide spread of the multi-drug resistant clones of E. coli and K. pneumoniae further reduce the therapeutic options, for which only carbapenems, tigecycline and colistin might be active. While older drugs, such as fosfomycin (probably in combination), merit being investigated in systemic infections, new drugs active against these organisms are clearly needed. The increasing prevalence of ESBL producing Enterobacteria in the community and hospital is not just a threat anymore but a real everyday problem.\n\nH. Giamarellou\u00b0(Athens, GR) Resistance to carbapenems due to the production of metallo-b-lactamases (MBL) or KPC enzymes in Enterobacteriaceae is an increasing international public health problem. An MDR or even an PDR phenotype is associated with carbapenem resistance in Enterobacteriaceae, because these strains usually harbor mechanisms of resistance to aminoglycosides and quinolones, as well. Nevertheless, some of these strains often exhibit low-level resistance to carbapenems with MICs remaining in the susceptible range rendering the therapeutic role of carbapenems questionable. The armamentarium against PDR Gram-negative microorganisms has almost been exhausted. The only options left are colistin, an antibiotic introduced in the 1950s, and tigecycline, a modified minocycline. Monotherapy or combination therapy with colistin is most often used but recently, the emergence of colistin-resistant strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae has limited our therapeutic options even further. There is accumulated evidence on the in vivo activity of tigecycline against MDR Enterobacteriaceae but the low levels of the drug achieved in blood indicate the necessity of a higher dose in case of bacteraemia. Some of the MBL or KPC producing Enterobacteriae are in vitro susceptible to fosfomycin. Clinical experience in the setting of serious infections by carbapenemase-producing bacteria is still limited. Finally, combination regimens have very often been used empirically in clinical practice although scientific evidence on the advantages of combinations is usually scarce with the exception of carbapenem-susceptible K. pneumoniae, for which clinical data suggest that the combination of meropenem and gentamicin could be active in vivo, in the case of meropenem MIC 2 mg/ml. The emergence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae highlights the \"end of antibiotics\". Concentrated efforts are needed to preserve and wisely use the few options available. In the meantime, intensified infection control measures may protect our hospitalized patients from these difficult to treat pathogens.\n\nS62 Biomarkers for the diagnosis of sepsis: do they provide added value?\n\nThe ambiguities of clinical signs and the limitations of current microbial techniques for the diagnosis of bacterial infections \u2212 and to grade their severity \u2212 are well known. The use of biomarkers provides a novel, complementary approach to diagnose infection, and to estimate treatment response and the outcome of patients. A plethora of proteins has been speculated to be \"promising markers\" in observational studies including c-reactive protein, various interleukins and chemokines and procalctionin, amongh others. Unfortunately, in most infections including sepsis, a true \"gold standard\" for diagnosis does not exist. Thus, the true \"added value\" of a biomarker in clinical use can only be assessed in interventions studies, where the endpoints are safety and antibiotic use.\n\nIn the hospital setting, this has only been shown for procalcitonin (PCT) in multiple randomized controlled interenvetion studies from several independent groups. With a similar outcome antibiotic exposure could be reduced from by 50 to 75%. For prognostic assessment, other biomarkers (e.g. adrenomedullin) have demonstrated high predictive potential to estimate the risk for mortality in the short and long term, and other adverse outcomes. A critical appraisal of the advantages and limitations of biomarkers in different clinical situations is mandatory. We discuss the current data on the use of PCT and other biomarkers for the diagnosis, treatment guidance, and prognostic assessment of bacterial infections, and their potential role in the overall assessment of patients with sepsis and respiratory tract infection as its most important precursor.\n\nC. Vandenbroucke-Grauls\u00b0(Amsterdam, NL) Molecular techniques are gaining more and more interest for rapid diagnosis of severe bacterial infections. DNA-hybridisation probes and PCR-based detection are used for rapid identification of bacteria after S14 20th ECCMID, Oral presentations the first signal of growth in conventional blood cultures. PCR-assays can also be used for direct detection of pathogens in blood. Such PCRs can be aimed at specific pathogens, or be more broad-range, in which case the PCR is followed by sequencing of the PCR product for identification. PCR can also be used for quantification of the amount of bacterial DNA in blood; several studies point to the value of the bacterial DNA load (BDL) in blood as a marker of severity of infection. This has been shown for pneumococci and meningococci in particular, and there is anecdotal evidence that BDL also correlates with severity of infection in staphylococcal infections. Interpretation of the results of PCR applied directly on blood samples needs further study, however, because several aspects of the kinetics of the presence of bacterial DNA in blood during infection are still unknown. In particular, we must be aware that it is difficult to define the best gold standard for bacteraemia, that PCR detects DNA, rather than living pathogens, that there is always a risk of contamination, and that little is known yet about background bacterial DNA in blood.\n\nSepsis is associated with mortality rates ranging from 20% to 50% and represents the second leading cause of death in the non-coronary intensive care unit. Early diagnosis of sepsis followed by prompt appropriate treatment improves the prognosis of septic patients. It has been suggested that nucleic-acid-based technology such as PCR is more sensitive and can also shorten the time to result when compared with conventional blood culture techniques. To date, however, little is known about the kinetics and the clinical and therapeutic relevance of bacterial DNA present in the blood of patients with sepsis over time in the course of an invasive blood stream infection. The recent introduction of more standardized new PCR-based diagnostic assays including tests that provide a more exact quantitative measurement of DNA, therefore, may open a window of opportunity for a better understanding of the kinetics and clinical significance of microbial DNA circulating in the blood of patients during a blood stream infection. In fact, the potential influence of bacterial DNA on the severity and outcome of blood stream infections is underlined by the findings of recent clinical and laboratory studies suggesting that procalcitonin plasma levels and SOFA scores were significantly higher, length of ICU and hospital stay were longer, and survival was clearly decreased in subgroups of septic patients revealing positive findings in both PCR testing and blood culture. Whether a better insight into the clinical significance of DNAemia will indeed contribute to more rapid initiation of better-tailored therapy and improved management of septic patients in conjunction with other laboratory markers, however, awaits further evaluation of in laboratory studies and interventional clinical trials. The present lecture will summarise what is known from recent studies on the diagnostic and clinical significance of DNAemia in patients with sepsis.\n\n\"Fever\" is a common symptom in critically ill patients and often sets into play a series of investigations by health care providers to establish an etiology. Recent practice guidelines for the evaluation of fever in the ICU patient recognize that \"knee-jerk\" responses to this syndrome, in the absence of careful clinical evaluation, lead to increased costs and morbidity for patients. In addition, many diagnostic studies are uninformative. Nevertheless, non-infectious causes of fever are often diagnoses of exclusion; a balance between expensive and invasive investigations, and \"old fashioned\" clinical acumen needs to be applied to evaluate fever in the ICU. In this session, common non-infectious etiologies of fever will be discussed with illustrative case examples, e.g.\n\ngout, drug fever, vasculitis, etc. In addition the role of molecular tests that are used to assist in determining the infectious etiologies of fever (PCR methods and biomarkers such procalcitonin and 1,3-b-glucan) will be reviewed.\n\nJoint diseases may present as acute, chronic and at the same time as monarticular or polyarticular arthritis. Most of the aetiological agents who have been identified in monarticular infections may also cause polyarticular infections. Similarly, most of the polyarticular non infectious arthritis may appear as monarticular. In many clinical situations extra-articular manifestations may differentiate infectious from non infectious arthritis. The recent development of new technology for culture and molecular biology has permitted to recognise virus or bacteria into the joints of degenerative, inflammatory and of course, in infectious arthritis. Reactive arthritis (ReA) is the conceptual ground somewhere between septic arthritis and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. The fact that some arthritis (Whipple, SAPHO etc) now have been recognised as infectious arthritis and may respond to antibiotic treatment, as prompted to treat a number of patients with arthritis of \"unknown aetiology\" with antimicrobials. Form a practical point of view the answer to the question \"When are arthritis real infections?\" may be \"When we can treat and cure the infection\". Three aetiologies are involved in most or the patients with acute monarticular arthritis; mechanical, infections and microcrystallines. Inflammatory arthritis may also present as monarticular arthritis. But besides that, more than 20 different non infectious diseases can produce acute arthritis (\"pseudoseptic\" arthritis\"). The tools for the diagnosis of arthritis are limited. As a matter of fact in Rheumatology the \"pattern\" of the disease is particularly important; what joints are involved, what is the sequence, the accompanying symptoms or even the duration of the disease. There are no definitive laboratory markers (except crystals and cultures in the synovial fluid). Biochemical and cytology values in synovial fluid permit to classified arthritis as mechanical, inflammatory or septic, but in a particular patient they have only a marginal value. In critical reviews for cytology in the synovial, fluid the evidence is mainly anecdotal and there are no reports of specifity, sensitivity and reliability.\n\nIn this topic as in many other, medical history, epidemiological investigation and clinical examination are the main stone for the diagnosis. Detailed history and physical examinations may raise the possibility of some initially unsuspected systemic or localized non infectious disease.\n\nThe hypothesis of an infectious origin for autoimmune diseases has received great attention during the recent years. Microbial agents or viruses can induce autoimmune diseases by a variety of mechanisms. For example, proteins of certain infectious agents can act as polyclonal activators on unique lymphocyte subsets. Viruses can preferentially infect/destroy a particular T cell subset, leading to an imbalance in the immune response. In other instances, infectious agents can up-regulate Th1 cytokines, thereby increasing selected expression of molecules such as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) glycoproteins, as well as activation of costimulatory molecules. Several microbial agents have been found to encode superantigens that can selectively activate subsets of T cells. Microbes can also direct the release of cytokines and chemokines, which can act as growth, differentiation, or chemotactic factors for different Th populations and regulate expression of MHC class I and class II molecules. On the other hand, the healthy immune system is tolerant to the molecules of which the body is composed of. However, one can find that among the major antigens recognized during a wide variety of bacterial viral and parasitic diseases, many belong to conserved protein families, sharing extensive sequence identity or conformational fits, with host's molecules, namely molecular mimicry. Antigenic similarity of either molecules' linear amino-acid sequences or their conformational structure between antigens of infectious agents and host tissues might trigger an immune response against the shared determinant. As a result, the tolerance to autoantigens breaks down, and the pathogen-specific immune response that is generated cross-react with host structures to cause tissue damage and disease. In this presentation, the cases of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus and the antiphospholipid syndrome, among others, will be reviewed as clear examples of autoimmune diseases where an infectious origin is postulated.\n\nNasopharyngal colonisation with pneumococci is frequent but in contrast pneumococcal pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease are comparatively infrequent events. This reflects the success of both innate and adaptive host responses to pneumococci. The presence of a variety of virulence factors including polysaccharide capsule and pneumolysin challenges the host response. Epithelial cells sense microbial products and release cytokines in response to pneumococci in the lower respiratory tract. Soluble factors, including complement factors, activated through both the classical and alternative pathway, play an important contribution to host defence in the lung. Alveolar macrophages play a critical role as the resident phagocytes in the lung clearing bacteria from the lung and orchestrating the inflammatory response. Once resident defence becomes compromised an inflammatory response including the recruitment of neutrophils becomes essential to microbial control but comes at the potential cost of compromising lung homeostasis. The regulation of this process also requires macrophage competence to ensure a limited inflammatory response which results in bacterial clearance but without lung injury. During the evolution of pulmonary infection a number of critical transition points occur when specific molecules and host responses are critical in determining how the infection evolves and what the outcome of infection will be. The infectious inoculum, the virulence of the pathogen and host susceptibility determines the position of these transitions and the relative role of key host defence strategies. There is increasing recognition of the role of T-cells, B-cells and dendritic cells in the pulmonary response to pneumococci. The integration of these various host responses to pneumococci, in most cases, represents a paradigm which provides a template for successful host responses to pathogenic pulmonary bacteria.\n\nC. Donati\u00b0, A. Muzzi, A. Covacci, R. Rappuoli, V. Masignani, M. Barocchi (Siena, IT) S. pneumoniae is part of the normal upper respiratory tract flora but it can become pathogenic causing a variety of diseases, which range from otitis media and sinusitis to pneumonia, septicemia, and meningitis. Due to its intimate relationship with the human host, S. pneumoniae has evolved a series of strategies to vary its genetic repertoire to evade the host immune response. Using their ability to recombine DNA acquired from the environment, S. pneumoniae strains are able to renew their dispensable genome (i.e. those regions of the genome that are not shared by all isolates). Dispensable genes are frequently acquired and lost, causing a loss of correlation between the phylogenetic history of strains and the presence of genes encoding proteins with antigenic properties. As a consequence these organisms have access to a genetic repertoire \u2212 the pan-genome \u2212 that is larger than the genome of any component strain. At the species level the pan-genome of S. pneumoniae grows as the number of sequenced strains increases due to the influx of genetic material from closely related species, and the mode of this growth positions the pneumococcal species on the edge between open and closed pan-genome. A second strategy for antigenic variation is shown by the evolution of pili, long filamentous appendages involved in adhesion to host cells. Pili are encoded in the rlrA islet, a 12 kb genomic region, that consists of the rlrA transcriptional regulator, rrgA, rrgB and rrgC, coding for LPXTG proteins forming the structure of the pilus, and srtB, srtC and srtD, coding for sortase enzymes catalyzing the pilus polymerization reaction. Due to their exposure to the host immune response, rrgA and rrgB are under positive selection that causes an increased rate of fixation of new alleles, and exist in three distinct clades that correlate with the MLST designation of the strains. Instead the rrgC, srtB, srtC and srtD genes, coding for proteins not directly exposed to the host immune system, are not under positive selection. In the region containing these genes, there is evidence of homologous recombination, and 4 major recombination hotspots can be identified. Due to the homogenizing effect of recombination these genes, differently from the major structural components of the pilus, are well conserved at the sequence level. In addition, piliated strains of Pneumococcus have been associated with multi-drug resistance cassets that may provide S. pneumoniae added fitness.\n\nStreptococcus pneumoniae is worldwide a leading cause of morbidity and mortality due to respiratory and invasive diseases. WHO estimates that annually at least one million children under 5 years of age die of infections caused by this pathogen. The more than 90 different capsular serotypes make it difficult to design a preventive strategy with universal pneumococcal coverage. In 1983, a 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine was marketed, being effective against invasive pneumococcal bloodstream infections in adults. Unfortunately, this vaccine proved low immunogenic in children due to it's T-cell independent type of immuneprotection. In 2000, a new 7-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was licensed in the USA, protecting very well against invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) caused by vaccine serotypes, also in infants and young children. However, within the years following implementation of PCV7, in addition to a serious drop in vaccine serotype diseases, a significant increase in IPD caused by non-vaccine serotypes was observed. The impact of this so called 'replacement' disease on the total incidence of IPD seems to vary by population and country. Recently, two extended pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have been approved for use in children and adults, covering most of the currently 'emerging serotypes'. In this presentation, the following topics will be addressed; What most likely causes 'replacement' disease: vaccine pressure, 'unmasking' of non-vaccine serotypes, secular trends or a combination of those? Do we expect the new extended conjugate vaccines to solve the issue of 'replacement' disease? Do we expect in addition to shifts within IPD causing serotypes also shifts in diseases caused by other respiratory bacteria? What are potential new vaccine candidates, and what do we expect of those vaccines with respect to impact on pneumococcal and non-pneumococcal diseases?\n\nVentilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) is an intermediate process between colonization of lower respiratory tract and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) . Postmortem studies showed a continuum between S16 20th ECCMID, Oral presentations bronchitis and pneumonia in mechanically ventilated ICU patients. The progression from colonization to VAT, and in some cases to VAP depends on quantity and virulence of the bacterial pathogen, and host lung defenses. VAT is common in mechanically ventilated patients. Its incidence ranges from 3\u221210% of ICU patients. Definition of VAT is matter of debate. Our group defined VAT using all the following criteria: fever (>38\u00baC) with no other recognizable cause, purulent sputum production, positive culture of respiratory specimen at significant threshold, and no radiographic signs of new pneumonia. Portable chest radiograph is inaccurate in diagnosing new infiltrates in mechanically ventilated patients. Therefore, differentiating VAT from VAP could be a difficult task in ICU patients. VAT is frequently caused by Gram-negative bacilli, especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Although several studies investigated risk factors for VAP, few have evaluated risk factors for VAT. However, risk factors for these infections appear to be similar. Age >60 years, COPD, prior antimicrobial treatment and surgery were identified as risk factors for VAT. Tracheobronchitis is characterized by lower respiratory tract inflammation and increased sputum production. These factors may generate weaning difficulties, resulting in longer duration of mechanical ventilation. In a large cohort of mechanically ventilated patients, VAT was significantly associated with longer duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. Beneficial effects of antimicrobial therapy were recently reported in VAT patients. In a randomized blinded placebo-controlled trial, aerosolized antibiotics significantly reduced the incidence of subsequent VAP. Further, aerosolized antibiotics increased weaning from mechanical ventilation, reduced usage of systemic antibiotics and antibiotic resistance. The impact of systemic antibiotics on outcomes of VAT patients was evaluated in a randomized unblinded controlled study. Antibiotic treatment increased mechanical ventilation free days, and reduced the incidence of subsequent VAP and ICU-mortality. Future studies should confirm these promising results, and determine the best duration of antimicrobial therapy in VAT patients.\n\nC. Linssen\u00b0 (Maastricht, NL) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and human herpes simplex virus (HSV) belong to the family of Herpesviridae. Both CMV and HSV are highly prevalent and ubiquitously distributed. In the immunocompetent adult host CMV and HSV infections usually have a benign course. As is the case with other herpesviruses, the initial infection is followed by a lifelong latent infection from which reactivation can occur. In immunocompetent individuals, asymptomatic viral shedding may be detectable in respiratory materials such as saliva or sputum in case of both HSV and CMV and also in urine in case of CMV. This viral shedding in patients without active viral disease makes it difficult to diagnose active disease in patients, especially since the symptoms of CMV and HSV infection (excluding typical skin lesions) are often non-specific. In immunocompromised patients CMV can lead to severe disease varying from retinitis and pneumonitis to generalized CMV disease. Occasionally, HSV may cause pneumonia as a result of immunosuppression, with a high mortality. However, critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) are considered immunocompetent. Studies performed in ICU patients have shown these patients to be at risk for severe infections with CMV and HSV. In case of CMV, results from previously conducted studies point towards reactivation from latency as the most likely explanation rather than primary infection in ICU patients. Recent studies suggest that active CMV infection is quite common in ICU patients, with a prevalence up to 35%, depending on the sub-group of patients studied. Furthermore, an association between the presence of a CMV infection and increased mortality in critically ill patients was found. In recent years, the interest in HSV as a causative micro-organism in ICU patients has increased, especially as a cause of pulmonary infection. Recent reports detected HSV-1 in respiratory samples from ICU patients not considered to be primarily immunocompromised. In all studies a significant adverse effect of HSV-1 shedding in the respiratory tract on clinical outcome was established. Two studies showed an association between a high load of HSV present in the respiratory tract and increased mortality. At this moment it is not clear whether the association of both CMV and HSV with increased mortality is due to the micro-organism itself or that it is just an indication of the deteriorating physical condition of the patients leading to reactivation of the virus.\n\nThe concept of clinical sepsis \u2212 when all cultures are negative in a \"septic\" patient P. Eggimann\u00b0 (Lausanne, CH) Despite all attempts to prevent them, nosocomial infection (NI) may complicate the stay of up to one third of patients requiring ICU management and the development of a sepsis of any severity should be considered as a potential NI. Prompt initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics and source control are key factor for favorable outcome. A majority of them are device-related and a systematic workshop should be performed to identify them. Documentation of the source of infection may then allow to more specific measures, such as abscess drainage or catheter removal. Guidelines nowadays also include recommendations for systematic periodical revaluation of the evolution in order to adapt antibiotics and other therapeutic measures. In the absence of positive cultures, combination of clinical evolution and some biological parameters may contribute to safe de-escalation strategy.\n\nDuring millions of years \"arms-race\" shaped evolution not only between the species across the planet but also inside the human body. Innate immune system is constantly evolving different strategies to detect and destroy intrusive microbes, while microbes evolving herewith. What are the strategies that microbes can develop to avoid and circumvent immune recognition?\n\nWe study the evolution of the model organism Escherichia coli under the selective pressure of bacterial killing cells, the macrophages (cell line RAW 264.7), which form an important component of the innate immune system. In approximately 100 generations all bacterial lines, evolved in the presence of the macrophages, showed a remarkable polymorphism, which did not occur in the controls. The relative abundance of the new morphs fluctuated stochastically over time, exhibiting a mixture of local peaks and short periods of apparent stable frequency. The distinct genotypes are marked by morphological differences clearly seen in the E. coli forming colonies and in FACs measurements. Furthermore, the first observed morphs that persist better inside the macrophages because of the slow growth rate and deficiency in metabolism have the same characteristics as SCVs (small colony variants) sampled from patients with various recurrent and persistent infections. Other morphs became resistant to engulfment and possibly killing by phagocytes and showed mucoid phenotype. Investigating the long-term consequences of biotic interactions is clearly an emerging field of research because has implications on applied biomedicine furthermore it will be able to generate predictions concerning the nature of adaptations of microorganisms to multiple infections and to the immune system. \n\nA. Dehn Lunn\u00b0, A. F\u00e0brega, J. Vila, R. Read (Sheffield, UK; Barcelona, ES) Objectives: Previous studies have suggested that fluoroquinolone resistance may be associated with attenuated virulence, and this may be the reason for the low levels of fluoroquinolone resistance compared with nalidixic acid resistance in Salmonella clinical isolates. We compared the intracellular survival of wild-type (ciprofloxacin MIC: 0.012 ug ml-1), fluoroquinolone-resistant (ciprofloxacin MIC: 64 ug ml-1) and reverted (ciprofloxacin MIC: 1.5 ug ml-1) S. Typhimurium in murine macrophages.\n\nThe fluoroquinolone-resistant S. Typhimurium was obtained in vitro by serial passage of the wild-type strain in increasing concentrations of ciprofloxacin, whereas the reverted strain was obtained from passage of the fluoroquinolone-resistant strain on antibiotic-free media. J774.2 macrophages were seeded at 2\u00d710 5 cells per well and left to adhere for 24 hours. Control wells were fixed with paraformaldehyde. Prior to infection, wells were blocked with BSA for 30 minutes. Bacterial cultures were grown to log phase and then diluted to infect the macrophages with an MOI of 100. A gentamicin protection assay was performed, with viable counts performed at 0, 1, 4 and 24 hours. Results: Fluoroquinolone-resistant S. Typhimurium showed significantly decreased overall survival in comparison to wild-type (median area under the curve (AUC) of 1.49\u00d710 6 versus 1.43\u00d710 5 , statistically significant at the 1% level). In most experiments, there was a log difference in bacterial concentration (cfu ml-1) between the wild-type and resistant strains at all timepoints. There was not a significant difference between the wild-type and reverted strains or between the reverted and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains. To determine whether there was a difference in intracellular replication, data were analysed as a percentage of the bacterial concentration at t = 0 (that is, 90 minutes after infection). There was not a statistically significant difference between groups (p = 0.96). Conclusions: Fluoroquinolone-resistant S. Typhimurium showed decreased survival in murine macrophages. Further work is needed to identify the genes responsible for this change, since the mutants were not isogenic. S18 20th ECCMID, Oral presentations O81 Binding and activation of plasminogen on Fusobacterium necrophorum P. Kuusela\u00b0, N. Friberg, H. Jarva, P. Mattila, R. Soliymani, M. Baumann (Helsinki, FI) Objective: Many bacteria have plasminogen (Plg) receptors (PlgR) on their surface. Binding to PlgRs enhances activation of the bound Plg to active enzyme plasmin and leads to protection of surface-associated plasmin against physiological plasmin inhibitors. Surface-associated plasmin is thought to play a pathogenetic role in various infections. In this work we have studied Plg binding and activation on Fusobacterium necrophorum (Fnec), an important Gram-negative rod-shaped anaerobe causing Lemierre's syndrome characterized by sepsis and internal jugular vein thrombosis preceded by an oropharyngeal infection. Methods: Plg binding was monitored by incubating bacteria isolated from clinical samples with I125 Plg alone or in various combinations with lysine analog epsilon-amino-caproic acid (EACA), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and alfa2-antiplasmin (alfa2AP), the physiological plasmin inhibitor, followed by counting of the bound radioactivity or by analyzing the bound Plg with SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Plg activation was recorded by following the breakdown of the chromogenic substrate S-2251 in various reagent combinations. Tentative fusobacterial PlgRs were identified by means of ligand blotting of bacterial outer membrane proteins with Plg and by subsequent MALDI-Tof analysis. Results: Fnec (n = 11) bound significantly better iodinated Plg than F. nucleatum (n = 14). Binding was inhibited by EACA and lead to enhanced activation by tPA. Formed plasmin was protected against inhibition by alfa2AP. Additionally, SDS-PAGE analysis of the bound plasmin revealed trimming of the formed Glu-plasmin to a slightly shorter Lys-form of the enzyme. Ligand blotting/MALDI-Tof analyses revealed that acyl-CoA dehydrogenase was a predominant Plg binder among the fusobacterial outer membrane proteins.\n\nThe present results show that Fnec has a much stronger capacity to bind Plg than F. nucleatum. Inhibition of binding by EACA indicates that lysine binding sites in the N-terminal portion of Plg are involved in the binding. Inability of alfa2AP to inhibit formed plasmin activity emphasizes the receptor association of plasmin. Trimming of the surface-associated Glu-plasmin into the Lys-form speaks for an increased affinity between plasmin and PlgRs. Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase is a strong tentative PlgR on Fnec. The data indicate that formation of surface associated plasmin on Fnec may play an important role in tissue invasion and in escape from thrombi.\n\nG. Schneditz\u00b0, M.M. Joainig, C. H\u00f6genauer, E.L. Zechner (Graz, AT) Objectives: Klebsiella oxytoca has been shown to be the causative agent for Antibiotic Associated Hemorrhagic colitis (AAHC). The disease occurs during medical treatment with penicillin and results in a sudden onset of bloody diarrhoea and abdominal cramps. Pathological features are mucosal haemorrhage and mucosal oedema that affect the ascending colon and cecum. The histological features of the AAHC resemble toxininduced colitis and a cytotoxic substance is found in conditioned (cellfree) medium of bacterial cultures. We aim to identify genes involved in cytotoxin production and secretion. The identification of cytotoxicity related genes will allow the biochemical description of the toxin and should provide insights into the effects on the host cells.\n\nA human epithelial Hep2 cell line is used to measure cytotoxicity of the Klebsiella product qualitatively and quantitatively via the MTT viability assay. A random miniTn5 transposon mutagenesis created a library of randomly inserted knock out mutants in an AAHC patient isolate of K. oxytoca. The mutant library was screened for loss of cytotoxicity. The transposon insertion sites of toxin negative mutants were identified through isolation of adjacent chromosomal DNA via a plasposon rescue protocol followed by DNA sequencing. Finally, specific deletion mutants of the identified genes were generated and complementation of the cytotoxin negative phenotype was performed. Structure and regulation of cytotoxin production genes and the cytotoxin's chemical nature are under investigation. Cytotoxin positive and -negative K. oxytoca strains will be screened furthermore for distribution of those genes. Results: So far screening the mutant library revealed two toxin negative mutants. The insertion sites cluster in the same region, indicating an operon. Three functionally related putative genes could be identified: a non-ribosomal peptide synthase, a DAHP synthase and a Xaa proline amino peptidase. The genes are involved in the non-ribosomal peptide biosynthesis and are not conserved in other Klebsiella species. Conclusion: The clustering of mutations leading to a cytotoxin negative phenotype suggests that the non-ribosomal biosynthesis pathway is essential for cytotoxin production. The substance family known to be synthesized through that pathway in other organisms includes numerous fungal and bacterial effector substances, including antibiotics, cytostatics and siderophores.\n\nA. Friaes\u00b0, C. Silva-Costa, J. Melo-Cristino, M. Ramirez (Lisbon, PT) Objectives: The chromosomal genes speB and speF do not encode true exotoxins (SpeB is a cysteine protease and SpeF a mitogenic factor), but are commonly included in the exotoxin gene profiling of Group A Streptococci (GAS) and have both been implicated in virulence. The aim of the present work was to confirm the presence of these genes in all GAS isolates and to characterise in detail any putative genomic deletions.\n\nThe genes speA, speB, speC, speF, speH, and ssa were PCRscreened in a total of 724 GAS isolates (160 from invasive infections and 564 from pharyngitis). PCR-negative results for speB and speF were confirmed by Southern blot hybridization with probes specific for each gene. Long-range PCR with primers specific for the regions flanking the putative deletions was performed, and the exact deletion breakpoints were determined by sequencing.\n\nThe absence of speB was detected in four isolates, one of which was also the only isolate negative for speF. The latter was an emm28/ST52 strain isolated from blood. Sequencing confirmed a deletion of 4933 bp by comparison with the published genome sequence of the emm28 strain MGAS6180, between nucleotides 2463 and 7395 (GenBank NC007296). The other speB-negative isolates belonged to emm types 4, 11, and 13, and were all isolated from pharyngitis cases.\n\nThe presence of the speB and speF genes is a characteristic of GAS recovered from human infections. Still, four isolates (0.6%) were speB-negative and one (0.1%) was speF-negative. The speB\u2212 speF\u2212 isolate was apparently highly virulent, in spite of the 4933 bp deletion encompassing several genes encoding proteins recognized to be important for virulence, such as SpeB, SpeF, the transcriptional regulator Rgg, the glycerol dehydrogenase, as well as four ORFs of unidentified function.\n\nO84 Lipocalin 2 is detrimental during murine pneumococcal pneumonia J. Warszawska\u00b0, O. Sharif, B. Doninger, I. Mesteri, K. Stich, S. Knapp (Vienna, AT) Objectives: Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) is an antibacterial protein, known to interfere with bacterial siderophore-dependent iron acquisition. Thus, Lcn2\u2212/\u2212 mice are highly susceptible to infections with siderophoredependent pathogens such as E. coli and mycobacteria. Although no siderophores have been detected in Streptococcus pneumoniae, infection with this bacterium induces tremendously elevated levels of Lcn2 \u2212 and the biological role of this finding remains elusive. We therefore attempted to investigate the role of Lcn2 during pneumococcal pneumonia.\n\nAge-and sex-matched C57BL/6 and Lcn2\u2212/\u2212 mice were inoculated intranasally with Streptococcus pneumoniae and sacrificed 6 or 48 hours after infection or monitored for survival. Lungs were homogenized and plated on agar plates for bacterial counts and cytokine detection or embedded in paraffin for histological analysis. Results: We observed significantly more KC and IL-6 in the bronchoalveolar lavage of Lcn2\u2212/\u2212 mice 6 hours after infection. This resulted in significantly increased neutrophil influx after 6 hours leading to improved bacterial clearance after 48 hours. Consistent with this observation we found decreased cytokine levels and reduced lung inflammation in Lcn2\u2212/\u2212 mice at later time-points after infection. Finally, Lcn2KO mice displayed a significant survival advantage over wild type animals. Conclusion: Lcn2 is detrimental during murine pneumococcal pneumonia. We postulate that Lipocalin 2 prevents the early induction of inflammation upon S. pneumoniae infection and thus impairs clearance of bacteria and survival.\n\nS. Hofer, D. Grandgirard, T. Trachsel, S.L. Leib\u00b0(Berne, CH) Background: Bacterial meningitis (BM) leads to learning deficits in up to 50% of survivors. The histomorphologic correlates of the deficits include apoptosis of neurogenic cells in the hippocampus, a brain structure involved in learning.\n\nObjective: To use an in vitro system of hippocampal neuronal differentiation to (i) identify triggers and molecular mechanism of apoptosis and, (ii) to investigate whether the differentiation stage during neurogenesis determines the vulnerability for apoptosis. Methods: Stem-and neuronal progenitor-cells were isolated from postnatal (P4\u22126) rat hippocampus. Dissociated cells were driven into neuronal differentiation by the addition of BDNF for 21d. Cells were challenged with different stimuli characteristic for BM: Growth factor deprivation (GFD) by omission of BDNF, EGF and FGF for 24 h, application of TNF-a (20ng/ml) for 24 h and exposure to live bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae), together with penicillin and streptomycin (10ng/ml) to cause bacteriolysis, for 2 h. Differentiation stage was documented by immunoassaying for nestin (stem cells), doublecortin (immature neurons) and MAP2 (neurons). Neuronal differentiation in vitro was documented by a shift in the predominant staining pattern from nestin at 1d, doublecortin at 7\u221214d and MAP2 at 21d ( Figure 1A ). Caspase dependent and independent apoptosis was immunoassayed by active caspase-3 and annexin-V, respectively.\n\nResults: Caspase-3 dependent apoptosis was observed after GFD (27\u00b17% of cells) and TNF-a (29\u00b13%) but less after bacteria (5\u00b13%) in mixed cell population at 7d. In contrast, apoptosis identified by annexin-V staining was induced by bacteria (25\u00b16%) and to a lesser extent by GFD (16\u00b17%) and TNF-a (17\u00b13%). Vulnerability to apoptosis peaked at 7d when stem cells and immature neurons were specifically susceptible for caspase-3 dependent apoptosis induced by GFD 10\u00b111% and 17\u00b112% and by TNF-a 13\u00b117% and 28\u00b112% respectively ( Figure 1B) . Conclusions: In a novel in vitro system of hippocampal neuronal differentiation, GFD and TNF-a induced caspase dependent apoptosis while bacteria induced caspase independent apoptosis. Stem cells and immature neurons are specifically vulnerable to undergo apoptosis in paradigms of BM. These results suggest that hippocampal injury in BM includes apoptosis of stem cells. The compromised regenerative potential of the hippocampus may contribute to the persistence of neurological deficits after BM. Objective: Streptococcus suis type 2 is an important swine and human pathogen responsible for septicaemia and meningitis. We demonstrated that in the brain of infected mice with S. suis, microglia expressed increased levels of different pro-inflammatory genes. To expand our knowledge of the interactions between S. suis and microglia, we evaluated the signalling pathways underlying S. suis-induced proinflammatory events. Methods: Mouse microglia line BV-2 was infected with a virulent wild type (WT) strain of S. suis or a panel of mutants altered at the capsule (CPS-mutant) or cell wall levels. Phagocytosis was quantified by an antibiotic protection assay. Cell supernatants were used to measure pro-inflammatory cytokines by ELISA and nitric oxide (NO) by the Griess reaction. Analysis from cell lysates, to evaluate inflammationassociated intracellular signalization pathways, was carried out by western blot using specific antibodies against iNOS, p-PKC, p-Tyr and mitogen-activated proteine kinase (MAPK) members p-JNK, p-ERK 1/2 and p-p38. Specific inhibitors of MAPK were used to confirm their participation in cytokine production. The involvement of the inflammatory transcription factor NF-kB was monitored by EMSA. Results: Phagocytosis and cytokine studies showed that the CPS was the only relevant virulence factor modulating bacterial interactions with microglia. The CPS helped bacteria to resist phagocytosis and regulate the inflammatory response as it hides pro-inflammatory components from the bacterial cell wall. S. suis induced iNOS expression and further NO production from microglia. Cells infected with the CPS-mutant showed stronger phosphorylation profiles for PKC, Tyr and MAPK. Likewise, pharmacologic inhibition of MAPK abrogated TNF-a and MCP-1 production from infected cells. Finally, S. suis-induced NF-kB translocation was faster for cells stimulated with the CPS-mutant, suggesting that bacterial cell wall components are potent inducers of NF-kB. Conclusions: Our data help to better understand the mechanisms underlying S. suis induction of inflammation in the brain, that in time would be useful to design more efficient anti-inflammatory strategies for meningitis. 19/30 (63%) of the ASP were not limited to a specific clinical area of the hospital and could be considered \"hospitalwide\" programs. Most of these ASP (70%) have been working for more than 5 years. The most frequent principles of ABX stewardship implemented in these programs were: 1) ABX streamlining or de-escalation and 2) intravenous to P.O. switch, both present in 23/30 of the surveys followed by 3) monitoring of \"strategic\" ABX (22/30). 26/30 (86%) of respondents stated that any physician could initially prescribe all of the antimicrobials included in the formulary. The most frequently activity carried out in the setting of Spanish ASP was 1) ABX restriction 80% followed by 2) conferences (74%) and 3) therapeutic audit and feed-back TAFB (68%). Asked for the antimicrobials that should be closely monitored, carbapenems (26/39), linezolid (11/30) and fluoroquinolones (11/30). A majority of respondents (72%) was highly pleased with this task. The most efficacious activity in the setting were thought to be the TAFB (68% considered them highly efficacious) and automatic reminders of antimicrobial duration of therapy. Conclusions: A minority (41%) of the surveyed hospitals in Spain has an ongoing ASP and large geographical variations were observed. Few of the ASP (30%) have been implemented in the last 5 years. TAFB was perceived as the most useful intervention in the setting of ASP. Carbapenems, linezolid and fluoriquinolones were considered the ABX most suitable to be monitored. The interventional policy by an AMT, based on the development of agreed upon prophylactic and therapeutic antimicrobial regimens, regular educational activities and microbiological and pharmaceutical monitoring significantly improved not only the appropriateness of antimicrobial prescription in this high-risk setting, but also the economical costs of antimicrobial acquisition.\n\nO89 Efficacy and efficiency of a restrictive antibiotic policy on MRSA in the intensive care unit N. Vernaz\u00b0, R. Aschbacher, B. Moser, S. Harbarth, P. Mian, P. Bonnabry, L. Pagani (Geneva, CH; Bolzano, IT) Objectives: To determine the efficacy and the efficiency of a restrictive antibiotic policy on the incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the 18-bed general Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of an 850-bed tertiary care hospital in Italy. Methods: Based on updated microbiological reports and clinical pharmacology parameters, the dedicated Antimicrobial Management Team pursued a more appropriate approach to antimicrobial prophylaxis and empirical therapy in ICU, either withdrawing ampicillin/sulbactam (AS) prophylaxis, or targeting vancomycin (VAN) therapy whenever indicated. Using an intervention time-series analysis, we first evaluated the efficacy of AS and VAN restrictions on their consumption, then combined this model with a transfer function model on use of other antibiotics and finally assessed the efficiency on the incidence of clinical isolates of MRSA from April 2004 to December 2007. The WHO ATC/DDD classification was used as reference normalized per 100 patient-days (PD).\n\nResults: The intervention model demonstrated that the restrictive antibiotic policy yielded a statistical significant decrease of AS from 303 to 134 DDD/100 PD, and R2 was 64% in November 2003; six months later, VAN decreased from 36 to 11 DDD/100 PD (R2 of 46%). Five months after AS restriction, the MRSA incidence significantly decreased from 3.4 to 1.4 cases. The final model explained 42% of the incidence of MRSA over time, showing, conversely, that an increase of 1 DDD/100 PD of antibiotics increased the incidence of MRSA isolates from current level, i.e. 0.043 for ceftriaxone (significant impact at lag 2 and 3), and 0.012 for levofloxacin, at the same time. Conclusion: This study shows that modelling antibiotic use can either drive a more appropriate empirical and targeted antimicrobial therapy, or inform policy makers about negative adverse effects of certain antibiotic agents on selection of MRSA, and may ultimately control and prevent the misuse of antimicrobials. Restriction of several broad-spectrum antimicrobials might positively impact on MRSA, even if case-mix and the huge inhomogeneity of patients in general ICU may negatively affect the overall fitness of the model.\n\nEscherichia coli using population-based data from a large hospital and its surrounding community N. Vernaz\u00b0, B. Huttner, D. Muscionico, J. Salomon, P. Bonnabry, J. L\u00f3pez-Lozano, J. Schrenzel, S. Harbarth (Geneva, CH; Alicante, ES) Objectives: We determined the temporal relationship between antibiotic use and the incidence of antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli both in the inpatient and outpatient setting of the Swiss canton of Geneva. A temporal effect between resistance in community isolates and outpatient use of ciprofloxacin (immediate and time lag, 1 month) and moxifloxacine (time lag 4 months) was observed, explaining 52% of the variance over time. The incidence of cefepime resistance in E. coli, as surrogate marker for ESBL, was correlated to ciprofloxacin use in the inpatient (lag 1 month) and outpatient (lag 4 months) settings and to the use of ceftriaxone (lag 0 months), piperacillin / tazobactam (lag 3 months) and cefepime (3 months) in the hospital (R2, 51%). Conclusions: These results support efforts to reduce prescriptions of selected antimicrobial drug classes such as fluoroquinolones for reduction of resistant E. coli including ESBL and show the added value of time series analysis to better understand the interaction between community and hospital antibiotic prescribing. O91 Reduction in ciprofloxacin use in a university hospital correlates with increased susceptibility to both quinolone and b-lactam antibiotics in Gram-negative organisms J. Troughton\u00b0, G. Millar, E. Smyth, R. McMullan (Belfast, UK) Objectives: An antibiotic policy revision was implemented at our institution, a university hospital in Belfast, in July 2008. Its purpose was to substitute ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin, with B-lactam antibiotics.\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate whether, following the policy change, there was a:\n\n\u2022 change in usage of piperacillin-tazobactam (pip-tazo), aztreonam, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin and meropenem, based on defined daily doses (DDD) prescribed; \u2022 shift in the proportion of Gram-negative organisms susceptible to these antibiotics; \u2022 significant relationship between susceptibility and usage of these antibiotics. Methods: The first isolate of all Gram-negative organisms recovered from blood cultures, sputum and urine of hospitalised adults, between January 2008 and August 2009, were included. The proportion of isolates reported susceptible, before and after the policy change, were compared by c 2 test; DDD before and after were compared using independent t-test. The association between DDD prescription and susceptibility was tested using Pearson correlation and linear regression. Results: Ciprofloxacin use decreased (p < 0.001) and aztreonam use increased (p = 0.03) following policy revision. There was no change in meropenem, ceftriaxone or pip-tazo use. In all, 5445 isolates were evaluated; the proportion susceptible to ciprofloxacin (p < 0.001), aztreonam (p < 0.001), and pip-tazo (p = 0.049) increased. A significant inverse linear association between ciprofloxacin use and susceptibility was detected (p < 0.001; correlation p < 0.001). Furthermore, pip-tazo, aztreonam and meropenem susceptibility were inversely correlated with ciprofloxacin use (univariate pip-tazo r = \u22120.39 p = 0.045; aztreonam r = \u22120.69 p < 0.001; meropenem r = \u22120.53 p = 0.008), with a linear relationship apparent (pip-tazo p = 0.089; aztreonam p = 0.001; meropenem p = 0.016). Surprisingly, there was a significant positive linear association between aztreonam use and susceptibility (r = 0.61 p = 0.004). Conclusions: These data suggest that an antibiotic policy revision, successfully reducing ciprofloxacin use, correlated with an increase in ciprofloxacin susceptibility among Gram-negative organisms. Furthermore, this was also associated with an increase in susceptibility to B-lactam antibiotics, in spite of increased use of aztreonam. Therefore, reducing quinolone exposure within a population appears to exert a favourable effect on both quinolone and B-lactam susceptibility of Gramnegative organisms. Conclusions: Implementation of a fluoroquinolone ban has proved challenging, but has rewarded with a reduction in cases of CDI and fluoroquinolone resistance in E. coli. Such an intervention may be a useful adjunctive measure in the management of outbreaks of infection due to Clostridium difficile ribotype 027. Of concern, is the increased use of broad spectrum agents such as meropenem. Further effort is required to limit the use of such agents, particularly in the context of the recent emergence of carbapenemase producing Enterobacteriaceae and the lack of new anti-Gram-negative agents. O94 Do published studies provide accurate estimates of the association between antibiotic exposure and acquisition of antibiotic-resistant bacteria? M. A. Cataldo, G. De Angelis, M. Cipriani, R. Cauda, E. Tacconelli\u00b0( Rome, IT) Objectives: Antibiotic stewardship is usually included in a multifaceted approach to combat the spreading of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) into the healthcare setting. Numerous papers have demonstrated that prior antimicrobial drug exposure is a strong risk factor for infection due to ARB. However, the association between antibiotic therapy and the acquisition of ARB is still unclear and it is often confounded by scarce data on antibiotic usage. Our objectives were to define major limits of the available evidence and to explore the sources of heterogeneity. Methods: Two meta-analyses were performed to determine whether antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for the isolation of ARB. Target bacteria were: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and carbapenems-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB). The I2 test was calculated to assess whether results varied no more than might have been expected by the play of chance. The subgroup analysis was performed by stratifying sampling frame for inclusion, definition of case subjects and controls, study design, geographic area of the study, presence of adjustment of covariates and length of time in which antibiotic exposure was detected. A significant heterogeneity was considered for I2 > 50%. Results: Seventy-eight studies (60 related to MRSA and 18 studies to CRAB) were considered eligible for inclusion. All studies were cohort, case-control or prevalence survey. Patients who had taken antibiotics had a risk increased by 1.8 (95% CI, 1.7\u22121.9) and by 1.3 (95% CI, 1.2\u22121.4) fold of acquiring MRSA and CRAB, respectively. Significantly heterogeneity was detected for study design, definition of controls, sampling frame for inclusion, endemic / epidemic setting, adjustment for covariates. A regression analysis revealed that the heterogeneity was linked to the length of time in which antibiotic exposure was detected before isolation, selection of the control group, and sampling frame for inclusion. Conclusions: Our analysis confirms that the quality of the evidence available on the association between antibiotic therapy and the acquisition of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is poor. Specific guidelines focused on methodological issues to address the epidemiology of antibiotic-resistant infections are urgently needed.\n\nO95 Divergent intentions to use a local antibiotic guideline: a theory of planned behaviour survey P. Cortoos\u00b0, B. Schreurs, W. Peetermans, K. De Witte, G. Laekeman (Leuven, Brussels, BE) Background: In order to improve antimicrobial practice, correctly identifying antibiotic guideline barriers, and assessing their relative importance are important factors. The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) permits such assessment and has been used already for evaluating antibiotic use (1) . According this theory, the intention driving guideline use, is fuelled by three factors: attitude; subjective norm (SN) (perceived social pressure regarding guidelines); and perceived behavioural control (PBC) over the guideline. Using a TBP-based questionnaire, we wanted to study how guideline use is affected in our hospital.\n\nMethods: Based on earlier observations, a questionnaire was constructed, modified to account for habit strength (2). After pilot testing, the survey was distributed among physicians in a major teaching hospital. Results: Out of 393 contacted physicians, 195 completed questionnaires were received (50.5% corrected response rate). Using multivariate analysis, habit strength (b = 0.186; P = 0.022) and PBC (b = 0.171; P = 0.036), were significant determinants for overall intention. A moderator effect of respondents' position (staff member vs. resident) was found with staff members' intention influenced by habit strength (b = 0.281; P = 0.038), and residents' intention by PBC (b = 0.220; P = 0.040) only. Other factors were not significant. Looking for specific issues, education on antibiotics and guidelines was rated unsatisfactory. Conclusions: These divergent origins stipulate different approaches for improvement. With staff members experiencing a high influence of previous routine and habits, preferred interventions for this group are education, focused on changes in prior antibiotic practice and their causes, and reminders. Residents' intention is guided mainly by external influences and the amount of self-confidence, making feedback, convenient guideline formats and thorough guideline familiarization more suitable. Reference(s) [1] Results: Out of the 19 potential participants, 14 (74%) responded. Four of the non-responders withdrew officially indicating 'panel used for research' (n = 1) and 'assay not offered' (n = 3). The majority of datasets were generated by PFGE (n = 11), with the remainder generated by AFLP (n = 2) and spa typing (n = 2). Seventy-three percent of participants typed all samples correctly, all with PFGE. Results obtained from spa-typing and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) were found to be less discriminative than those obtained with PFGE. Discussion: We present the first EQA programme for the genotyping of MRSA. PFGE was implemented by most of the participating laboratories. However, most protocols proved to be suboptimal, resulting in inferior resolution in the higher or lower fragment regions. This suggests that further assay optimisation is required. The lack of resolution was most evident with the closely related MRSA strains in the panel. Results generated using AFLP and spa-typing showed less discriminatory power compared to PFGE. Participants reported a range of criteria for determining genotype and subtype. (Figure 1 ), and thus allowed the rapid and accurate discrimination of the investigated serotypes. Conclusion: HRM analysis is a new single-step closed-tube screening method for fast mutation detection and can therefore be used to discriminate even genetically closely related samples. HRM analysis has the potential to complement the classical serotyping of Salmonella isolates due to its discriminatory power and simplicity. Antifungal therapy under the microscope: from fungus to mouse to man (Symposium supported by Gilead) S108 Do animal models help predict host responses to fungal infections and antifungal treatments? Choosing therapy on the basis of efficacy not safety\n\nClinical outcomes from invasive fungal infections involve a complex interplay between the infecting organism, antifungal treatment and the host immune response. Factors such as the host's neutropenic status are well known to influence outcome and may be of particular relevance if the antifungal treatment is fungistatic rather than fungicidal, but the immune response involves far more than neutrophils alone. Cytokine changes may correlate with both clinical response and clinical failure. In this symposium the faculty will show how changes in vitro may correlate with responses in vivo in animal models and therefore predict the response in the human host.\n\nMRSA: from molecular epidemiology to molecular screening (Symposium supported by Roche Molecular Diagnostics) S111 Differentiation between human epidemic and animal associated MRSA strains by LightCycler melting curve analysis U. Reischl\u00b0(Regensburg, DE) Objectives: A number of real-time PCR assays for direct detection of MRSA in clinical specimens are targeting the SCCmec-orfX junction in the S. aureus genome. With respect to their implication as screening tests performed at admission of a patient at risk for MRSA infection, such assays should be as rapid and as sensitive as possible.\n\nSelection of efficient primers and probes is complicated by the known sequence diversity among the various types of SCCmec cassettes. As a consequence, primer and probes are designed to cover the most common SCCmec types encountered in clinical MRSA isolates. Considering the enormous diversity of SCCmec sequences, rational primer selection can only be a best compromise between the coverage of as many SCCmec variants as possible and loosing analytical sensitivity due to primer multiplexing problems. Therefore incusivity rates may differ among the various PCR assay concepts. Methods: Three commercial PCR tests targeting the SCCmec-orfX junction were evaluated for analytical sensitivity, time-to-result and for their performance to cover animal-associated MRSA strains of the clonal complex CC398 next to human epidemic MRSA strains. Results: With exception of MRSA strains harboring \"uncommon\" SCCmec elements, all of the investigated human epidemic and animalassociated MRSA strains were detected by the Roche LightCycler MRSA Advanced Test, but the latter strains presented with a different Tm-value in melting curve analysis. DNA sequencing revealed single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the S. aureus orfX region characteristic for MRSA CC398 strains, which are obviously covered by the proprietary sensor hybridization probe of the assay. All MRSA strains covered by the LightCycler MRSA Advanced Test also tested positive in the BD GeneOhm MRSA and the Cepheid Xpert MRSA test, but either these real-time PCR tests had no option to perform Tm-analysis or viewing of melting curves. Conclusions: As a practical application of the newly identified SNPs, we present the use of this commercial real-time PCR test for the direct detection and simultaneous identification of animal-associated MRSA strains. All of the investigated MRSA CC398 strains harbored at least one of the novel SNPs in the SCCmec-orfX junction \u2212 represented by a characteristic Tm of 55.5\u00baC in subsequent melting curve analysis. Since such a Tm-shift was not observed with any non CC398 MRSA strains yet, it may serve as a molecular marker for the presence of MRSA CC 398.\n\nAntibacterial susceptibility testing and implications for resistance surveillance and treatment S120 Problems with low level resistance against quinolones\n\nBacterial resistance to quinolones is related to decreased permeability, active efflux, drug modification, target modification or target protection. Recent studies indicate that certain genes (recA, recC, tolC, fis, ruvC, xseA, xseB) also contribute to the intrinsic resistance of E. coli to quinolones. Microbiological and clinical aspects of low level quinolone resistance have been more often studied in enterobacteria. In these organisms, a single gyrA mutation causes resistance to nalidixic acid and MICs of fluoroquinolones as low as 0.125-0.25 mcg/ml (still higher than MICs of <0.008-0.06 mcg/ml for wild-type isolates). This mechanism favours the appearance of additional mutations in gyrA or in other topoisomerase-encoding genes, finally resulting in high level resistance. Target protection by Qnr proteins (often encoded by plasmid genes), decreased permeability by porin modifications or active efflux of chromosomal (particularly RND transporters) of plasmid (QepA proteins, OqxAB) origin also determine low level quinolone resistance. The Aac(6 )-Ib-cr enzyme modifies quinolones with a piperazinyl substituent. Both in vitro and in vivo data suggest that these additional low-level mechanisms may also represent an initial step for acquisition of increased resistance. Low level resistance mechanisms may be difficult to detect because they translate into MICs below current EUCAST or CLSI breakpoints. Interestingly, plasmid-mediated mechanisms may not sufficiently compromise the activity of nalidixic acid, which results in decreased susceptibility or low-level fluoroquinolone resistance in the absence of nalidixic acid resistance, which is in contrast with the usual consequences of mutations in topoisomerase genes. As quinolone efficacy is related to Cmax/CMI and AUC /CMI parameters, small variations (of even only 2\u22124 dilutions) due to low-level resistance mechanisms may contribute to therapeutic failure. Animal models and clinical data suggest a poor outcome of patients with severe infections caused by Salmonella, Klebsiella (and presumably other enterobacteria) with low level fluoroquinolone resistance. Because of these reasons, it would be important to know actual MICs of quinolones for clinical isolates, and to obtain additional information on quinolone resistance mechanisms. This will allow a better knowledge of risk factors for acquiring low level resistant strains, and a better definition of the actual therapeutic relevance of these organisms.\n\nThe emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains has complicated the treatment of S. aureus infections. Vancomycin is currently a cornerstone in the treatment of bacteraemia and infectious endocarditis (IE) due to this pathogen, but evidence linking vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4\u22128mg/ml to a high failure rate of vancomycin has led to the susceptibility breakpoint being considered when the MIC is 2mg/ml. However, vancomycin treatment failure is not uncommon even when MRSA strains are fully susceptible (MIC 2mg/ml), and studies have described a reduction in vancomycin efficacy against MRSA strains with high MIC but within the susceptible range. The presentation will deal with the different methods for determining the vancomycin MIC and discuss the implications of understanding the relationship between vancomycin MIC and vancomycin efficacy. (6 )-Ib-cr genes were found in 26% and 8% isolates, respectively. Qnr was mostly present in Klebsiella pneumoniae, while aac(6 )-Ib-cr was found exclusively in Escherichia coli. QepA was not found. Both genes were localized on plasmids and could be both transformed and trans-conjugated in acceptor strains. MIC of fluoroquinolones on these acceptor strains indicated a 20-100 increased resistance due to the plasmid-mediated mechanism. However, high-level resistance to fluoroquinolone in the wild-type strains was due to the additional presence of topoisomerase mutations in strains presenting both ESBL and PMQR. AmpC were detected on 5.5% isolates of Enterobacter spp. and Proteus mirabilis. Carbapenemases were found in 3% isolates of E. aerogenes, E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Carbapenemases were subsequently genotypically characterized as IMP, VIM, OXA, KPC CMY or SME types. Conclusions: Emerging resistance mechanisms were found in ESBLproducing strains, with PMQR being the most frequent. While genotypic assays implement phenotypic testing of AmpC and carbapenemases, they are the only methods available up to date for detection of PMQR. Hence, both phenotypic and genotypic methods should be employed to rationally direct the pharmacological treatment. were screened by specific PCRs and sequencing analysis. M13 fingerprint typing method was used to compare this isolate with others K. pneumoniae isolates found in this hospital. Results: K. pneumoniae 2564FF was isolated from a blood culture of a patient with leukemia at Santa Maria Hospital, Lisbon. The MIC for imipenem, aztreonam and to extended-spectrum cephalosporins was 32 mg/L. The resistant phenotype was unchanged by EDTA but the inhibition zones for imipenem, aztreonam and to extended-spectrum cephalosporins were increased with boronic acid. K. pneumoniae 2564FF produced a restrict b-lactamase SHV-1 and the carbapenemase KPC-3. The blaKPC-3 gene is part of a plasmid and no amplification was observed after PCR for detection of transposase, resolvase, and putative insertion sequences (IS) elements located upstream of blaKPC gene, suggesting that the blaKPC gene in K. pneumoniae 2564FF was included in a different genetic environment like Tn4401. M13 fingerprinting analysis revealed that this genotype had not been detected in the hospital previously. Also the sequence type ST11 was not detected in others K. pneumoniae KPC-producing strains described worldwide. Conclusions: This is the first report of K. pneumoniae KPC-3 clinical isolate in Portugal. Our findings should alert medical authorities to implement stringent methods for the detection and spread control of emerging KPC carbapenemases. O132 Characteristics of the multi-resistant bacteria that actually diffuse in the Centre region, France, in and out of healthcare institutions N. van der Mee-Marquet\u00b0, A.S. Valentin-Domelier, T. Charbonnier, M. Gras, L.A. Ligeon, N. Guichard, N. Girard, R. Quentin the RHC Study Group (Tours, FR) Objectives: Epidemiological study involving the teaching hospital, 20 general hospitals, 7 local hospitals, 16 private clinics, 12 rehabilitationcare centers, 5 psychiatric clinics, 30 nursing homes (NHs) and 19 in town-clinical laboratories (for outpatients), to document the diffusion of multiresistant bacteria (MRB) into the region (2.8 millions unhabitants). Methods: During 15 days, all MRB isolated from diagnostic clinical samples were documented and strains were centralized. After identification control, antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed (standard procedures). Genetic diversity of strains was studied (PFGE). 56% from urine (1.5% of urine samples), 23% from superficial pus (0.6% of pus), 9% from respiratory tract (5% of respiratory tract samples), 5% from deep pus, 4% from blood and one from intravenous devices. MRB belonged to 14 species. S. aureus (36%) and E. coli (31%) predominated, followed by E. cloacae (9%), P. aeruginosa (8%), K. pneumoniae (5%) and A. baumannii (2%). Vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis or E. faecium were not recovered. Diversity was the highest in healthcare institutions (HCIs). By contrast, S. aureus predominated in NHs, E. coli among outpatients. 70% of MRSA strains were nonmultiresistant (usually named CA-MRSA). 79% of ESBL-producing E. coli strains were CTX-M. MRSA and ESBL-producing E. coli strains were (1) mostly resistant to fluoroquinolones (93 and 60% respectively), (2) genetically diverse and distinct from clones classically spreading into HCIs, (3) widely spread in HCIs, NHs and outpatients, (4) responsible for rare outbreaks, but in NHs. E. cloacae, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis and A. baumannii were the most involved in outbreaks into HCIs, and were associated with a lower genetic diversity. Conclusion: MRD are unfrequent, but their diffusion is large, especially for recent MRSA and ESBL-producing E. coli clones. Prevalence is the highest into HCIs, but MDR diffuse now out of HCIs, and especially in NHs. We suggest that an effective alert system to detect emerging and/or epidemic phenomenon should involve MDR survey in HCIs, NHs and in town-clinical laboratories. Objective: To examine differences in antibiotic susceptibility of Gram negative bacteria and in antibiotic consumption in a Tertiary Hospital, within 7 years of operation. Methods: All clinical samples from inpatients. Identification and susceptibility testing, using the Wider \u00ae semi-automated system with CLSI breakpoints. Antibiotic consumption expressed as Defined Daily Doses (DDD) per patient-day. Objective: Metallo-b-lactamases are powerful resistance mechanisms that can generate insensitivity to virtually all b-lactam antibiotics.\n\nThe recent epidemic emergence of this resistance mechanism in Klebsiella spp., E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Providencia rettgeri in geographically distant areas of India and the UK is a major cause for concern. This project was initiated to determine the genetic vehicle(s) responsible for the rapid emergence and dissemination of the blaNDM-1 MBL in enteric organisms. Methods: Species identification and antibiotic susceptibility profile of 67 blaNDM-1 harbouring enteric isolates collected from Chenai (south India) and Haryana (North India) was performed using the Phoenix machine. Isolates were typed by pulsed field Gel electrophoresis after Xba1 digestion. Plasmids were visualized by ethidium bromide staining following PFGE of S1 partially digested plugs. Plasmids carrying blaNDM-1 were further identified by probing of the same gels using a 32P labelled blaNDM-1 and A/C rep probes. Transconjugants were selected following matting with J53 on MacConkey plates containing azide and 0.5 mg/L meropenem. Plasmid analysis on A subset of transconjugants (20) was performed by replicant typing and S1 PFGE and subsequent probing. A/C plasmid analysis was further performed using a set of 12 primers designed to amplify sections of the backbone of A/C plasmids and DNA probing with A/C probes. Results: All isolates from the North of India were Klebsiella pneumoniae and carried A/C plasmids of size 50kb (9), 80\u221290kb (2), or 118kb (11). However, in the south of India isolates were of various enteric species and gave numerous different pulsed field gel restriction types. Furthermore plasmids found in the isolates from the south were of many different sizes ranging from 100kb to 375kb in size. Probing indicated that most plasmids carrying blaNDM-1 were of rep A/C type (19/20) only 1/20 tested were found to be carried on the F plasmid. Transconjugants were selected for all strains except the small plasmids from the North of India. Transconjugants gave plasmids of mostly the same size but examples were found of size changes following transconjugation including both increasing and decreasing size. PCR on transconjugants and parents indicated differences in the A/C plasmid backbone. Conclusions: blaNDM-1 emergence in enteric organisms in India is linked mostly to A/C plasmid types of varying sizes ranging from 50kb to 375kb.\n\nObjective: E. coli is the most frequent cause of bacteraemia in the UK, and increasing antimicrobial resistance could severely compromise current therapeutic approaches. Objective: Atypical Mycobacteria can cause disease in both healthy and immunocompromised individuals. They can rarely cause disseminated infections. Nevertheless infections in immunocompromised patients by atypical mycobacteria are described. Results: We report a case of a 54-year-old man with diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) stadium III E B of the stomach, proximal duodenum, axillary, inguinal and cervical lymph nodes after six cycles R-CHOP 14 and one cycle R-DHAP chemotherapy received via central venous catheter (CVC) who develops leucopenia and anemia. Blood culture reveals Mycobacterium fortuitum. On admission to our hospital several days later a blood sample reveals leucocytosis (10.97\u00d710 9 cells/litre), low hemoglobin level (9.8 g/dl) and thrombocytosis (517\u00d710 9 platelets/litre). The C-reactive protein level was 43.9 mg/l. The patient has no fever. Blood cultures taken simultaneously peripherally and via CVC reveal both Mycobacterium conceptionense (Mycobacterium fortuitum group). The CVC is removed, but routine culture is negative for Mycobacteria. Because of a sustained bacteraemia for more than ten days and an underlying immunocompromission antibiotic treatment with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) and amikacin (15 mg/kg once daily) is done for two weeks in accordance with the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society (ATS). A repeat blood culture after therapy is sterile. Conclusion: In literature there are only few descriptions of invasive infections with rapidly growing Mycobacterium fortuitum. In a setting of underlying immunocompromised disease we treat bloodstream infection, advocate a duration of two weeks after having removed the catheter and review literature for the necessity for antibiotic treatment. \u2022 To assess underlying risk factors for infection \u2022 To assess treatment given, incidence of side effects, treatment cure and relapse rates Methods: In this retrospective study 2000-2007, we examined pulmonary NTM infections south London hospital. Cases were identified through the microbiological database and case notes records. Inclusion criteria were: culture positivity for Mycobacterium kansasii (MK), Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (MAI), Mycobacterium xenopi (MX) and Mycobacterium malmoense (MM); >18 years old; HIV negative; meeting the ATS (American Thoracic Society) clinical criteria. Radiological reports were made by a radiologist. Statistical analyses were made on SPSS v15, using t tests and Mann Whitney U as appropriate. Results: Of 211 patients identified with NTM isolates, 57 met inclusion criteria. Males (76%) with a median age of 60.5 years predominated. Predisposing factors were smoking (76.1%), alcohol (30.4%) and COPD (39.1%). Radiologically, cavitation (63.6%) and pulmonary infiltrates (31.8%) were common findings. 47 patients were treated, 10 not treated and 5 died. The predominant organism was MK, 35 of 47 cases (74.5%). Of the MK infections, there was a 100% cure rate with a 10% relapse rate over a 3 year follow up period. Treatment courses differed from British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines, most patients receiving triple therapy of rifampicin, ethambutol and usually clarithromycin or ciprofloxacin for >9 months. Side effects were common, occurring in 30% of treated infections. The statistically significant predictors of a poor outcome were a low pre-treatment weight and absence of fever. Conclusions: M. kansasii is the predominant NTM organism in London. Optimal treatment regimens are unclear. In this study many patients were treated with 3 agents, in counterpoint to BTS guidelines. However, adding a third agent to the treatment regimen for MK did not appear to reduce the relapse rate, but did increase the risk of side effects. Objective: Between May and September 2009 9 patients were referred to our infectious diseases outpatient clinic because of skin lesions and suppurative lymphadenitis after permanent make-up of the eyebrows. We present the clinical and microbiological characteristics of the patients and the results of the outbreak investigation. Methods: All but one patients had at least a lymph node fine needle aspiration, whereas skin biopsy of the eyebrow was performed only in 4 cases. Microscopic examination for mycobacteria, culture and broadrange mycobacterial PCR (16 S rRNA) were performed. Diagnosis of the first case was established using broad-range mycobacterium PCR. As PCR was positive for M. haemophilum, special culture was performed. After notification to the public health authorities, an investigation was started and all possibly contaminated material was examined for mycobacteria. Results: All patients presented with an inflammatory lesion of the eyebrow associated with ipsilateral lymphadenitis located within the parotid gland. The lesions appeared 2\u22126 weeks after permanent makeup of the eyebrows. Fine needle aspiration and skin biopsy of the eyebrow were positive for mycobacteria in 8 and 1 case, respectively. Microscopic examination showed acid-fast bacilli in 6 cases whereas broad-range PCR was positive for M. haemophilum in 5 cases. Culture was positive for 7 patients after 14-70 days (median 44 days) and the microorganism was identified as M. haemophilum. All patients were treated with various combinations of ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin and either rifampin or rifabutin. Parotidectomy, local eyebrow excision and partial neck dissection were performed in 3 cases. Three patients were in complete remission following surgical intervention, one patient was in partial remission after two months of conservative treatment. The remaining 5 patients were stable after 2\u22126 weeks of antibiotic therapy (still ongoing). Outbreak investigation showed that all makeup procedures were performed by the same tattoo artist. PCR of the the make-up ink was positive in 6 out of 19 samples for M. haemophilum, cultures are still negative after 5 weeks.\n\nWe report the first M. haemophilum outbreak after permanent make-up due to contamination of the make-up ink. PCR analysis of mycobacterial 16S rRNA is an effective tool for early diagnosis and for appropriate selection of culture method. Optimal management of the infection requires further studies. Protection studies on immune mice intraperitoneally infected with GBS. Results: All DNA samples from 85 GBS strains tested by PCR and hybridization were found to carry cspA gene. Two portions of scpB and two portions of cspA (pB1, pB3 and csp2, csp3) encoding for a helical regions of C5a-ase and CspA were amplified and cloned. Resultant proteins PB1, PB3 and CSP2, CSP3 (M.M. 12 kDa, 10 kDa and 42 kDa, 12 kDa, respectively) were successfully expressed in E. coli followed by purification with Ni sepharose. All polypeptides under study generated humoral immune response in mice and rabbits. The antisera were examined for their opsonizing ability against GBS strains of six different serotypes employing mouse peritoneal macrophages. The data demonstrated significant opsonizing effect of anti-PB1, anti-PB3, anti-CSP3 immune sera over the control. Mice preliminary immunized with the polypeptides were studied for development of GBS infection. As result obvious GBS clearance from the spleens of mice immunized with PB1, PB3 and CSP3 in comparison with control group was determined. In contrast anti-CSP2 antibodies were found to possess neither opsonizing ability nor protective activity in above mentioned experiments. Conclusion: 1. DNA from 85 GBS strains comprised cspA gene. 2. PB1, PB3 and CSP3 with high a helix structure displayed the immunogenic and protective properties that allowed proposing them as vaccine components against GBS.\n\nObjectives: Extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) are frequent causative agents of sepsis, neonatal meningitis and urinary tract infections. They lead to significant mortality and morbidity in humans as well as live-stock and are a big burden for healthcare providers. With fast rising antibiotic resistance rates among clinical ExPEC isolates preventive vaccination against these pathogenic E. coli is greatly desired. Methods: Based on genome analysis data and in vivo transcription studies we selectively target virulence factors expressed during the course of infection such as iron acquisition systems. Immunogenic regions as well as the unknown three dimensional structure of these proteins were analyzed in silico. MHCI and MHCII epitopes as well as proteasome cleveage sites were also taken into account. Based on this data two synthetic modular vaccine proteins were designed each bearing eight epitope rich subfragments. For each a fully synthetic gene was constructed and optimized regarding sequence and codon bias. We used and evaluated two application routes in the mouse model. First we used purified vaccine proteins for intranasal application. Second we used a novel Salmonella based bacterial antigen delivery system which is simply administered orally. As it translocates the vaccine directly into the cytoplasm of immune cells in vivo, T-cellular response is greatly enhanced. Results: Specific immune responses were evaluated with IFN-g ELISpot, flow cytometry and sub-class sensitive antibody ELISA. Intranasally immunized mice demonstrated massive increases of specific serum IgG as well as vaginal fluid IgA antibodies against the recombinant vaccine protein as well as against purified full length virulence factors of ExPEC. Expansion of vaccine specific IFN-g secreting T-cells could be proven in both immunization routes. In the challenge model of peritonitis a significant reduction of bacterial load could be achieved in immunized mice, demonstrating the first successful combined T-cell vaccine against ExPEC in the mouse model.\n\nCombined T-cell and antibody stimulating vaccines containing multiple epitopes are effective against ExPEC in the mouse. Further evaluation is needed to elucidate the potential for use in humans. Since 1990s, vaccination strategies against toxoplasmosis mainly used DNA vaccine, purified recombinant proteins showed variable protection because vaccine candidate antigens were almost always selected randomly and targeted tachyzoite form which invades the host cell abruptly and immediately embeds itself in a protective parasitophorous vacuole which keeps away the host immune response. Currently, there is substantial evidence about T. gondii oocysts (contains sporozoites) as being the cause of water related outbreaks. After classification of T. gondii oocysts in category B bioterrorism agents as a water safety threat, the demand for a protective vaccine against toxoplasmosis has increased. The present study aims to generate first time a DNA vaccine containing a sporozoite specific surface antigen \"SporoSAG\" to block the sporozoites as they are released from the oocysts in the intestine. To increase the efficacy of the vaccine, antigen specific-CD8 response inducing antiapoptotic Bcl-xL gene was inserted to the dual expression DNA vaccine. Methods: During the construction of the dual expression DNA vaccine, SporoSAG was inserted after CMV promoter and anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL were inserted in frame with EGFP after IRES (pIRES2EGFP-SporoSAG-Bcl-xL). In vitro transfection of BHK-21 cells was performed to show the expression of SporoSAG and Bcl-xL. The functionality of Bcl-xL was demonstrated by Casp3 flow cytometry. Humoral and cellular immune response (CD4/CD8, IFN-g) were analyzed from sera and spleen cells of vaccinated BALB/c mice by western blot and flow cytometry using purified recombinant SporoSAG protein ( Figure 1 ).\n\nWestern blot and fluorescence microscopy analyses of pIRES2EGFP-SporoSAG-Bcl-xL transfected BHK-21 cells showed SporoSAG and Bcl-xL expression. Casp3 analyses rationalized Bcl-xL expression that impedes apoptotic cell death. Analysis of sera obtained from vaccinated mice showed anti-SporoSAG antibody response compared to controls. Cellular immune response analyses showed increased CD8 and IFN-g response compared to controls indicative of protection against toxoplasmosis. O152 Assessment of a new DNA vaccine candidate against urinary tract infection J. Fallah Mehrabadi\u00b0, M. Hoseini Moghaddam, S. Najafi, N. Khoramabadi, M. Mahdavi (Tehran, Zanjan, IR) Objective: Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is one of the most common infectious diseases and the major agent of UTI is Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). Most of the time, it has affinity to attached to the vaginal and urinary tract mucosa tissue. UPEC has intracellular propagation, when do invasion of bladder epithelial cells. Therefore, cellular immune response is so important in this case. In our research, a genetic construct for inducing of cellular immune system was designed and immune response of immunized mice was evaluated. Materials and Methods: Chromosomal DNA extracted from E. coli 35218 as a positive type I pili strain and fimH gene amplified by using this template in PCR. The PCR product inserted to pBluescript cloning vector and sequenced. Then, the fimH gene sub cloned to pVax eukaryotic expression vector. The recombinant vector sequenced again. COS7 cell line transfected with a complex of pVax/fimH and ExGen 500 poly cationic polymer. Three groups of BALB/c mice immunized with recombinant DNA construct. The first group injected intramuscularly (i.m) with two doses (100 mg for every injection during two weeks) of purified pVax/fimH. The second group injected with the same amount of pVax vector and the third group injected with PBS as negative control. All mice challenged, one week following the second injection, with uropathogenic Escherichia coli strain 35218. Moreover, lymphocytes isolated from spleen of immunized mice and cultured for cytokines assay. Results: The sequence of E. coli 35218 fimH gene in our research showed more than 97% identity to other fimH sequence reports in GenBank. Expression of fimH gene in transfected COS7 was confirmed by RT-PCR. The result of challenge showed 100 times reduction of E. coli colonization in bladder tissue of first group mice. Additionally, IFN-g titer got rise in first group on compression with others groups. Discussion: fimH gene has a little variation among type I pili positive strains but it has less variation on amino acid sequences. Hence, it was detected more than 97% identity of E. coli 35218 fimH sequence with others. Expression of fimH in pVax/fimH cassette was confirmed by RT-PCR. Consequently, induction of cellular immune response was showed by increasing of INF-g titration in immunized mice. So, DNA vaccination has a potential candidate for limiting recurrent urinary tract infection.\n\npost-exposure treatment with doubling the intramuscular doses of conventional regimen and aluminium-adjuvanted tetanus toxoid T. Tantawichien\u00b0, W. Jaijaroensup, P. Khawplod, U. Thisyakorn, V. Sitprija (Bangkok, TH) HIV-infected patients with low CD4+ T lymphocyte had a poor Nab response to conventional pre-and post-exposure rabies vaccination. Our previous reports revealed that HIV-infected patients with CD4+ counts <200 /mL did not respond well to conventional intramuscular (IM) post-exposure vaccination or multiple-site intradermal (ID) vaccination. We conducted a prospective study of the Nab response after doubling the IM doses of WHO IM regimen (ESSEN) and aluminium-adjuvanted tetanus toxoid (TT) in AIDS persons. Fifteen AIDS patients (age range, 30\u221246 years) without active opportunistic infections who presented with possible or proven rabies exposure were enrolled. Four patients had severe exposure (WHO category III). All patients had a history of AIDSrelated conditions such as opportunistic infections or CD4+ counts <200 /mL, Only 5 patients did not received antiretroviral therapy. All patients were given the post-exposure rabies prophylaxis. They received doubling the doses of IM regimen (2\u22122-2\u22122-2\u22120) with purified Vero cell rabies vaccine (doubling the IM doses of vaccine in 1\u22121-1\u22121-1\u22120 ESSEN-IM regimen) but one of the two rabies vaccines on day 0 was dissolved in 0.5-mL dose of aluminium-adjuvanted TT. Blood samples were obtained on days 0, 7, 14, 28, 90, 180 and 360 after vaccination for rabies Nab. CD4+ counts were determined from all patients before vaccination. Blood was drawn for determination of HIV-RNA level on days 0, 28, and 90 after vaccination. There was no serious adverse reaction among all patients treated. No death as a result of rabies during the next 1 year was reported. Seven AIDS patients with CD4+ counts <100/mL (range, 1\u221299 /mL) had a poor or even undetectable Nab response. Eight AIDS patients with higher CD4+ counts (>250 / mL) had good Nab responses as our previous studies. We also observed that HIV-RNA level did not increase significantly after rabies vaccination. Conclusion: At present, cleansing the wound, vigorous wound injection with immunoglobulin, and determination of Nab response in AIDS patients who had very low CD 4 + T lymphocyte count after postexposure rabies vaccination are the most important post-exposure measures that can be offered to AIDS and moderately or severely rabiesexposed patients. Patients were further stratified to 4 groups according to CD4+ count when primary PCV was administered: group 1, CD4+ <200 cells/mL; group 2, CD4+, 200 to 349 cells/mL; group 3, CD4+, 350 to 499 cells/mL; and group 4, CD4+ 500 cells/mL. All patients were given 1-week diary to record any discomfort after vaccination. All statistical analyses are performed by STATA statistical software. Results: 407 HIV-infected patients were vaccinated with PCV during the study period: 206 patients received two doses and 201 patients one dose. After first dose vaccination, 372 (91.1%) patients who returned their oneweek diary for recording side effects were assessed. Among these 372 HIV-infected patients, 124 (33.3%) patients reported discomfort after the vaccination that included injection site soreness (22.85%), pain (8.60%), redness (1.08%), swelling (1.62%), fever (1.62%), headache (1.88%), fatigue (4.30%), cough (1.34%), rash (0.53%), rhinorrhea (0.27%), sneezing (0.27%), and insomnia (0.27%). None of these patients reported severe adverse events that prompted medical attention. The only factor that was found to be associated with occurrence of side effects was high nadir CD4 counts (P = 0.04) before vaccination. The associated factors for injection site soreness, the most common side effect after vaccination, included high nadir CD4 counts (P = 0.01) before vaccination and high HIV viral load at vaccination (P = 0.01). None of the patients who received two doses PCV reported aggravated discomfort after second dose vaccination. Conclusions: We conclude that vaccination with 7-valent PCV among HIV-infected patients was generally safe and high nadir CD4 counts before vaccination were associated with increased risk for injection side reactions. \n\nChildren are now mostly colonized with vaccine-related and non-vaccine strains with improved overall antibiotic susceptibility after the introduction of pn7 vaccine; but PSDP isolates are now mainly recruited among these. Inappropriate prescriptions threaten the sustainability of vaccine-related benefits through combined vaccine-and antibiotic-driven selective pressure. 1999 2002 2004 2006 2008 1999 2002 2004 2006 2008 1999 2002 2004 2006 2008 1999 2002 \n\nObjective: Evaluate the distribution of the pilus islets among Streptococcus pneumoniae recovered from invasive infections after 7-valent vaccine availability. Methods: Two pilus-like structures (PI-1 and PI-2) have been recently recognized in pneumococci. These have been implicated in virulence and suggested as potential vaccine targets. However these pilus-like structures are not universally distributed among pneumococcal strains. We had previously demonstrated that carrying PI-1 was a clonal property of S. pneumoniae and that only 27% of the invasive strains carried the rlrA islet. Furthermore, 83% of these piliated strains expressed vaccine serotypes. Similar findings were reported for the PI-2 islet which was shown to be present in 16% of a convenience sample of strains. PI-2 positive clonal complexes were associated with serotypes 1, 2, 7F, 19A, and 19F. The introduction of the 7-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV7) resulted in changes in serotype frequency that can also affect pili prevalence. To evaluate this effect we determined the presence of PI-1 and PI-2 among a collection of 475 invasive isolates recovered from children after PCV7 introduction (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) . The results were analyzed in terms of pilus islet association with antibiotic resistance, serotype, pulsed-field gel electrophoretic profile (PFGE) and multilocus sequence type. Results: Overall, 46.7% of the strains presented one of the pilus islet.\n\nAs observed in previous studies serotype distribution analysis showed a high correspondence between serotype and the presence and type of pili (Wallace coefficient, W = 0.85). This association was even higher when considering pili and PFGE cluster (W = 0.98). The rlrA islet was identified in 13% of the strains most of them expressing serotype 6B, 9V, 14, 19A and 19F . PI-2 islet was found to be present in 37% of the pneumococcal strains and was identified mainly among serotypes 1 and 7F. Conclusion: A decrease in the presence of the rlrA islet among invasive pneumococcal strains was observed after PCV7 availability. This change is associated with the decrease of vaccine serotypes since the majority of the strains carrying PI-1 expressed vaccine serotypes. In contrast, PI-2 islet was more prevalent due to the predominance of serotypes 1 and 7F. Since most of the strains carrying pili presented serotypes that are included either in current or future conjugate vaccine formulations, their potential use in a vaccine would offer limited additional benefits. \n\nObjectives: To survey the incidence and demographic, clinical and microbiological characteristics of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in hospitals in Europe.\n\nWe organised a network of 106 laboratories capable of isolating C. difficile strains in 34 European countries. In November 2008, 1\u22127 hospitals per country, depending on population size, tested stool samples of patients aged >2 years who were suspected of CDI, or who had developed diarrhoea after 3 days of hospital admission. CDI was defined by a positive enzyme immunoassay for C. difficile toxin A and/or B, a positive cytotoxicity test, or positive culture of a toxigenic strain. Each hospital collected detailed clinical data of the first 10 CDI cases, and sent stool isolates of C. difficile for PCR-ribotyping and characterization of toxin A, toxin B and binary toxin genes. After 3 months, follow-up clinical data were collected. Results: CDI incidence varied across hospitals (mean: 5.5 per 10,000 patient-days per hospital; range: 0 to 36.3). Detailed information was obtained on 509 patients and 395 isolates of these patients were available for characterization. Sixty-two different PCR ribotypes were found, among which 014 (15%), 001 (10%) and 078 (8%) were most prevalent. The prevalence of PCR ribotype 027 was 5%. Most patients had the previously identified risk profile of an elderly patient with co-morbidity and recent antibiotic use. At follow-up, 22% of patients had died and in 40% of these deaths CDI played a role. In multivariate analysis, age 65 yrs, use of macrolides and infection by PCR ribotypes 015, 018 and 056 were significantly associated with death to which CDI contributed. Ceftazidime use and having recurrent CDI at inclusion were significantly associated with recurrences during follow-up. Conclusion: In this pan-European, hospital-based study, the incidence of healthcare-associated CDI varied widely between hospitals. The overall and attributable mortality were high. Dominant PCR ribotypes were 014, 001 and 078, whereas 015, 018 and 056 were associated with a complicated disease course. These data emphasise the importance of multi-country surveillance and indeed that PCR ribotypes other than 027 are prevalent causes of CDI in Europe. In AC, 1,045 CDI-patients were reported; CDI incidence was 2.18 cases per 10,000 pd (1.05 case per 1,000 admissions). By origin, 686 (66%) cases were healthcare-associated (HA), 598 (87%) of which were acquired in the reporting HCF; 294 (28%) community-associated (CA); 65 (6%) of unknown origin (UO). Among 734 CDI-patients diagnosed in HCF actively following them up for a month, 100 (14%) were severe cases and 25 (3%) died from their CDI. In RLTC, 251 CDI-patients were reported; CDI incidence was 1.31 cases per 10,000 pd. By origin, 231 (92%) cases were HA, 204 (88%) of which were acquired in the reporting HCF; 8 (3%) CA; 12 (5%) of UO. Among 186 CDI-patients diagnosed in HCF actively following them up for a month, 4 (2%) were severe cases and died from their CDI. Last, 237 C. difficile strains were sent by 54 HCF to the NRC; their characterisation and typing are underway. Conclusions: Preliminary results from this survey confirm that CDI incidence in France is much lower than reported in other European countries, and suggest that CDI are adequately controlled in French HCF. However, the high proportion of CA cases reported in AC wards suggests the need for further studies. Final results from this survey will be presented in April.\n\nRecent studies conducted in Canada, United States and Sweden pointed out that Clostridium difficile spores are present in retail ground meat thus suggesting that meat could act as food source of Clostridium difficile for human infections.\n\nObjectives: The aim of this pilot study was to estimate the occurrence of Clostridium difficile in minced beef and pork at retail in North-Eastern Italy.\n\nThe cross-sectional study was performed in February-March, 2008, in 150 retail outlets randomly sampled in 3 provinces of North-Eastern Italy. Among those 3 provinces retailer's sample size was proportional to resident population. In each sampled retailer one laboratory sample of minced beef and one of pork was randomly collected. Each sample was microbiologically processed using the Clostridium difficile selective medium Cefoxitine Cycloserine Fructose broth (added with Taurocolate). After 10 days of incubation broth cultures were plated on blood agar base, horse blood red cells added (5% v/v), and tested by PCR for detection of Clostridium difficile DNA according to Penders (2005) . The presence of toxins A and B in the broth culture was evaluated by Techlab C.diff quik chek complete kit (Techlab). A positive control (meat experimentally infected with Clostridium difficile spores) was carried out simultaneously with each batch of the experimental samples.\n\nIn total 300 (150 pork and 150 beef) samples were analyzed. All samples were negative for Clostridium difficile both at the microbiological and PCR analysis. Search for Toxin A and B gave negative result as well. Conclusion: Although public health relevance of Clostridium difficile contaminated food is yet to be clarified, these preliminary results prompt to consider that ground beef and pork do not represent a risk factor for human infection in North-East of Italy. Our findings are supported by those of Von Abercron (2009), who found a low prevalence (2%) of Clostridium difficile contaminated ground meet in Sweden. Differently Rodriguez-Palacios (2007) and Weese (2009) in Canada, and Songer (2007) in United States reported 12\u221220% and 42%, respectively, prevalence of Clostridium difficile contaminated ground meat. These apparently conflicting results may be due to different prevalence of Clostridium difficile at fatted calf and swine primary production or to different hygiene both at slaughterhouse and at retail outlets. The hypothesis should be further investigated. In the overall logistic regression model, length of stay, transfer from another NHS hospital, number of different antibiotics, number of days of quinolone antibiotics, degree of comorbidity and number of days of nitroimidazole antibiotics were identified as risk factors (see figure) . Reduction in odds of CDI with H2-blocker therapy was an interesting finding.\n\nOn subgroup analysis the three main strains were all associated with length of hospital stay and transfer from another NHS hospital. All were associated with antibiotic use, especially quinolones. Only ribotype 001 was associated with cephalosporin use. PPI therapy was only a risk factor for ribotype 106. The 014/020, 078 and 027 ribotypes had the highest observed rates of mortality and morbidity, but there were no significant difference in mortality or morbidity detected between different ribotype. Discussion: This study did not find any difference in mortality or morbidity between different strains of Clostridium difficile, but did find some differences in risk factors between ribotypes. An unexpected association of H2-blocker therapy with a reduction in odds of CDAD was observed.\n\nThis study has some limitations. Diagnosis of Clostridium difficile associated disease was based on toxin detection, which may not be sensitive or specific. Details to be presented.\n\nMultiple logistic regression model for all ribotypes.\n\nObjectives: The diagnosis of Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) associated diarrhoea is usually based on the detection of faecal toxin A/B, rather than on stool cultures. Therefore, studies on the correlation between the incidence of C. difficile and antibiotic consumption were limited to toxic strains in the past. The aim of this ecological study was to analyse the association between unit-specific antibiotic consumption and the incidence of toxigenic and non-toxigenic C. difficile in hospitalised patients. Methods: Unit specific antibiotic consumption data and the incidence of C. difficile in 19 units over 5 years were analysed at the University Hospital of Basel, Switzerland. Stool samples were tested for toxin A/B and simultaneously cultured. In a second step, positive cultures were tested for toxin production. In order to analyse specific antibiotics, unit specific length of stay and antibiotics showing a significant association in univariate analysis were entered in a multiple linear regression model. Results: Over 5 years, a total of 165 first isolates of toxin producing C. difficile and 413 first isolates of C. difficile were detected. The incidence of C. difficile overall and of toxin producing C. difficile was 0.39 and 0.15 per 1000 patient days, respectively. The correlation (figure) is highly significant in both analyses (p < 0.001), but a higher correlation results when all C. difficile strains are included in the model (R = 0.80 vs. R = 0.63). In a multivariate analysis explaining more than 80% of the variance of the incidence of C. difficile (R2=0.82), only piperacillin/tazobactam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and the aminoglycosides were found to be statistical significant risk factors.\n\nWe show for the first time, that the correlation between antibiotic consumption and the C. difficile incidence rates significantly improves, if detection is not limited to toxin producing strains. Overall antibiotic pressure as a risk factor was previously underestimated due to restriction to the toxin producing strains. Our results underline the importance of the overall pressure of antibiotics that explains the majority of the variance rather than the importance of a single group of antimicrobial agents such as quinolones. Therefore, interventions to reduce the overall antibiotic consumption might be more successful in controlling C. difficile incidence than interventions focusing on certain groups of antibiotics. Figure. Correlation between unit-specific antibiotic consumption and incidence of C. difficile. Conclusions: Impaired immune function, a high comorbidity burden, advanced age, and the presence of other infections were seen as risk factors for HO-HCFA CDI. Antibiotic therapy has been known to play a central role in the pathogenesis of CDI but the observation of tigecycline exposure's protective effect is unexpected. Additional research is needed to better understand the differential risks and benefits of various broad spectrum antibiotics among patients at risk for HO-HCFA CDI. . In a multivariate analysis after adjustment for age, sex and geographical region, the relative risk was 1.6 (95% CI 1.0\u22122.4). Conclusion: An identical mortality was seen for patients with CD strains possessing the binary toxin \u2212 irrespective of the PCR ribotype (CD027 or CD non-027). The mortality for patients with CD A and B strains was significantly lower than among patients with CD027 and CD non-027 but higher than among unselected patients. The results suggest that the binary toxin either is a marker for more virulent CD strains or contributes directly to the virulence of these strains. Furthermore, the data confirms that criteria used in the Danish CD surveillance programme ensure molecular characterisation (genotypic toxin profiling and PCR ribotyping) of the most virulent strains enabling detection of emerging hyper virulent strains.\n\nBackground: It has been suggested that treatment of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) with broad spectrum antibiotics and newer fluoroquinolones in particular, contributes to selection for Clostridium difficile (C. diff). We studied the prevalence of C. diff carriage, selection for C. diff and development of C. diff infection (CDI) in patients (pts) hospitalized and treated for LRTI and compared the different treatment regimes. Methods: Pts receiving antibiotic treatment for LRTI in one university medical center and an affiliated teaching hospital were prospectively followed for 30 days with careful monitoring of the development of diarrhoea. Of all patients, stool samples collected on admission, day 5, day 3 after discontinuation of antibiotics and day 30 were cultured for C. diff using selective plates. Cultured isolates were further characterized for toxin production and typed by PCR ribotyping. CDI was defined as the presence of diarrhoea and a positive faeces toxin test. Results: Of 107 pts included, 45 (41.1%) pts were treated with moxifloxacin, 47 (43.9%) with b-lactam monotherapy and 15 (14.0%) with b-lactam/macrolide combination therapy. The endemic rate of CDI in the participating hospitals is 0.6/1000 pts a year. In total, during the study period, C. diff was cultured in 18.7% (n = 20) of pts. 6 (30%) isolates were toxin positive. On admission, baseline prevalence of C. diff carriage was 10.4% (n = 10). Of those, one patient had mild CDI and persistent positive cultures for C. diff during the study period. The overall acquisition rate of C. diff carriage after antibiotic treatment for LRTI in our population was 10.3% (n = 11). Acquisition rates of C. diff carriership were 11.1% (n = 5) in moxifloxacin, 10.6% (n = 5) in b-lactam and 6.7% (n = 1) in b-lactam/macrolide treated pts (p = NS). Tests for faeces toxin production were negative in all pts who acquired C. diff. No acquired CDI or relapse of previous CDI occurred during the study period. Risk factors for C. diff carriership at any time were intravenous antibiotic treatment >7 days (OR 3.89, 95% CI 1.3-11.8) and hospitalization the past 3 months (OR 4.08, 95% CI 1.4-11.9). Conclusions: In a setting with a low endemic rate, acquisition rates for C. diff during antibiotic treatment for LRTI were 10% and did not lead to CDI. Moxifloxacin was not associated with increased acquisition rates for C. diff as compared to other antibiotics classes prescribed for LRTI.\n\nL. Ratnayake\u00b0, J. McEwen, N. Henderson, D. Nathwani, G. Phillips, D. Brown, J. Coia (Dundee, Glasgow, UK) Objective: Description of an outbreak of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) affecting nine patients in a vascular surgery ward over a 6 week period in 2009 caused by a high level clindamycin resistant PCR ribotype 106 (clindamycin MIC > 256 mg/L). Methods: C. difficile outbreak was suspected on the basis of three cases within 30 days and departure from the normal pattern. A case of CDI was defined as a patient with diarrhoea, positive for C. difficile toxin and negative for other enteric pathogens. Cultures were sent to Scottish Reference Laboratory (SSSCDRL) for PCR ribotyping, antibiotic susceptibility testing and PCR detection of ermB.\n\nResults: The ward has 24 beds (6 side rooms). The outbreak involved 9 patients: two diagnosed post discharge. The mean age of patients was 73 years (range 38-90 years). Eight patients were male. All had significant underlying medical disorders and received clindamycin and ciprofloxacin. This was in accordance with the approved and long standing antibiotic policy of the unit. None of the cases had severe complications of C. difficile. All nine cases were typed as PCR ribotype 106 and they showed high level resistance to clindamycin suggesting cross transmission on the ward. Five of these isolates were tested by PCR for the presence of the ermB gene and no amplification was detected. This strain has rarely been isolated outwith this ward. The outbreak was controlled successfully by closure of the ward with terminal cleaning using a hypochlorite solution, reinforcement of infection control precautions especially hand washing, stopping the use of ciprofloxacin and clindamycin and the introduction of a new antibiotic policy. There have been no new cases of C. difficile for over 120 days since the last outbreak case was diagnosed.\n\nConclusion: This report demonstrates that outbreaks of CDI can be caused by C. difficile PCR ribotypes other than 027. This outbreak was caused by an unusual strain that displayed high level clindamycin resistance, not mediated by ermB and belonged to PCR ribotype 106. The outbreak was most likely associated with the use of clindamycin and cross infection with spores in this environment. This report highlights that implementation of strict infection control precautions, antimicrobial stewardship and enhanced environmental cleaning are key components in managing such an outbreak successfully. Interestingly the number of MRSA acquisitions also dropped dramatically after these interventions.\n\nA. Guleri\u00b0, R. Palmer, K. Woodrow, N. Harper, M. Jagadeesan (Blackpool, UK) Background: Clindamycin (CD) has been widely reported in literature to be associated with high risk for C. difficile infection (CDI). Highdose CD (daily defined doses = DDD data) use for variety of clinical indications has steadily increased in last 3-yrs in Blackpool Victoria Hospital (large district hospital). A Clostridium difficile infection containment programme (CCDCP) was introduced with an aim to reduce avoidable CDI, associated morbidity, mortality & costs and increase quality of care and patient safety. The rates of CDI in trust have declined since introduction of CCDCP. Real time monitoring through 2 multidisciplinary audits (Feb-Apr07 & Sep-Dec08), multicentre regional health protection agency led nested case-control (296 each) study on CDI and rootcause analysis of every case (Jan-Oct 2009). Findings(incl. data on use of CD) from these have been used to inform and fine tune the program. Azithromycin \u2212 new horizons (Symposium supported by Teva) S171 Azithromycin in the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis\n\nProstatitis is an inflammatory condition of the prostate that presents with urethral symptoms, prostatic symptoms and sexual dysfunction. It is diagnosed by clinical symptoms and signs, the microscopy of expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) and culture of EPS and segmented urine samples. Prostatitis is chronic when symptoms have been present for at least 3 months. As a part of several scientific research projects we have been prospectively investigating prostatitis syndrome at the Outpatient Department of Urogenital Infections and Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Dr Fran Mihaljevic University Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Zagreb, Croatia, since March 1, 1999 and is still ongoing. We examined more than 3450 patients over 18 years of age with symptoms of chronic prostatitis and no evidence of lower genitourinary tract abnormalities. Azithromycin fulfills the criteria for the treatment of chronic prostatitis and sexually transmitted infections \u2212 high efficacy against the most common bacterial agents of urogenital and sexually transmitted infections, acceptable toxicity and tolerability, simple oral use, excellent penetration through chronic inflammatory changed prostate capsule, achieves high concentrations in prostatic tissue and slowly eliminates for 4\u22128 weeks, has anti inflammatory and immunomodulatory effect, and is active against bacterial biofilm. At total of 307 patients with chronic prostatitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis were treated with azithromycin in a total dose of 4.0, 4.5 or 6.0 g for 3\u22124 weeks. Eradication of Chlamydia trachomatis was achieved in about 80%, with 70% of patients clinically cured. There were no statistically significant differences between these three dosage regimens. A total of 82 patients with chronic prostatits caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum were treated with azithromycin in a total dose of 4.5 g for 3 weeks. The eradication of Ureaplasma urealyticum was 85% and clinical cure 76%. Conclusion: azithromycin is an effective and safe antimicrobial drug for the treatment of chronic prostatitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum. It is recommended in a total dose of 4.5 g po. during 3 weeks, administered for 3 days weekly in a dose 1x500 mg po. per day.\n\nThe results of recently published clinical studies on the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis with combination therapy with ciprofloxacin and azithromycin are impressive. We also have a limited, but positive experience.\n\nAzithromycin \u2212 new horizons (Symposium supported by Teva)\n\nAcute infectious gastroenterocolitis is a common disease worldwide. In most cases, gastroenterocolitis does not require antimicrobial treatment as it is considered a self-limiting and mild disease of short duration. However, antibiotic therapy is indicated in most severe cases. HIV-positive or immunocompromised patients should also receive antimicrobial treatment. In such cases, antibiotics could decrease the duration of the disease, enable a faster recovery and shorten the carrier state. Azithromycin proved effective in the treatment of acute infectious gastroenterocolitis. Two studies involving US military personnel in Thailand indicated that a single azithromycin dose (1 g) or a 3-day regimen (500 mg/day) were comparable or superior to ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin in empirical treatment of acute diarrhea. Efficacy of azithromycin in the treatment of traveler's diarrhea in infants and children has also been suggested.\n\nCampylobacter enterocolitis is the most frequent form of acute bacterial diarrhea affecting humans, particularly children and young adults. We evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of a single oral azithromycin for the treatment of Campylobacter enterocolitis in children 12 years of age, administered early in the course of the disease compared to a standard 5-day erythromycin regimen or no antibiotic. Our study suggests that a single azithromycin 30 mg/kg administered early in the course of Campylobacter enterocolitis in children 12 years of age effectively eradicates the pathogen and accelerates clinical cure attainment and that it is clinically superior to an early commenced 5-day erythromycin regimen.\n\nRespiratory tract infections (RTIs) continue to be the major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), including CAP, were ranked third in a list of the 30 leading causes of death worldwide in 1990. Out of all pathogens, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis and \"atypical\" pathogens still remain to be the most prevalent ones, independently on the country. Traditionally, b-lactamase, modern macrolides and respiratory fluoroqinolones (for adults only) are drugs of choice for the therapy of RTIs. But antimicrobial resistance among these pathogens continues to be the major challenge for the physicians in all countries. A total of 2,449 S. pneumoniae from 23 cities of Central, North-Western, Southern, Privolgsk, Ural, Siberian and Far-Eastern regions of Russia were studied from 1999 to 2009. b-lactams retained comparatively high in vitro activity against S. pneumoniae: non-susceptibility to penicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate and ceftriaxone/ cefotaxime was 9.7%, 0%, 1.8% in 1999-2003; 8 Proportion of multiresistant S. pneumoniae did not exceed 12% in studied period. Ampicillin resistance in Haemophilus influenzae was 5.4% with no resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanate. Resistance to azithromycin wass found to be 1.5%. Moraxella catarrhalis seems to be of low epidemiological importance in Russia, being isolated only in rare cases from patients with otitis media and acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis with virtually all strains being b-lactamase producers and retaining susceptibility to b-lactam/b-lactamase inhibitors.\n\nIn conclusion, all above three classes of antimicrobials retain their place in treatment of RTIs.\n\nAzithromycin after twenty years of extensive use is still one of the most prescribed antibiotics in the treatment of bacterial, respiratory tract infections. Multidrug resistance (MDR) is reported worldwide, but clinical consequences of MDR still remain controversial. SuPoRTI study was designed to evaluate efficacy of a 3-day azithromycin therapy in the treatment of respiratory tract infections in adults and children and to compare results with early clinical trials. SuPoRTI study is a multicenter, prospective non-comparative phase IV study, which included 550 patients with bacterial upper and lower respiratory tract infections. Three countries and 26 centers participated in the study. Only outpatients were included in the study. The trial included patients with acute pharyngitis, sinusitis and otitis media as well as patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and mild to moderate community acquired pneumonia. Azithromycin was administered orally. Clinical effectiveness was assessed after the third or fourth visit and dynamic of clinical scores was assessed throughout the study. We present the results of effectiveness and safety of azithromycine obtained in this study.\n\nNon-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a common commensal of the human respiratory tract mucosa. It is a fastidious Gram-negative coccobacillus that resides exclusively in the human host. To date, NTHi infection has been accepted largely as opportunistic and to occur particularly in cases in which the host's immune status or physiological barriers have been compromised, for example in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults and otitis media (OM) in young children. However, there is increasing evidence that, despite the absence of a polysaccharide capsule, NTHi causes significant invasive disease as well as mucosal respiratory infections in subjects without predisposing risk factors. In both developed and developing countries, NTHi may cause septicaemia and meningitis in children at a prevalence at least equal to that due to a single, major Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype. In developed countries, especially in the post H. influenzae vaccine era, it is difficult to estimate the current disease burden, although some countries have suggested an increasing number of cases of invasive disease reported in the literature. Maternal genitourinary tract infection has been identified as a source of highly fatal, early onset neonatal NTHi septicaemia. The most significant mucosal infections known to be caused by NTHi are OM, sinusitis and conjunctivitis. Approximately one-third of the bacterial isolates from OM and sinusitis are NTHi.\n\nIn the post-PCV-7 era, a proportionate increase in the frequency of recovery of NTHi from mucosal isolates has been demonstrated in children and adults in the United States. Furthermore, several lines of evidence suggests NTHi may also play an important role in paediatric community acquired lower respiratory infections, especially in children with recurrent and persistent bronchitis & pneumonia. Further studies are warranted to understand the public health importance of NTHi, as a pathogen. This review suggests that NTHi, as a cause of invasive disease, has been underestimated and that there is an important invasive disease burden. NTHi appears to be more commonly responsible for mucosal respiratory infections than previously recognized.\n\nGuidelines on the treatment of respiratory tract infections (RTI) may need to be re-evaluated considering the increasing importance of nontypeable Haemophilus influenza (NTHI).\n\n\u2022 Reports comparing the prevalence of bacterial pathogens in acute otitis media and acute bacterial sinusitis in children prior to and after the introduction of the 7-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine (PCV7) show replacement of Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine types with non-vaccine types. They also show an increased prevalence of NTHi. \u2022 Recent reports confirm that NTHi are associated with recurrent and protracted morbidity. \u2022 There are signs that the b-lactamase-dependent b-lactam resistance in NTHi is being replaced by a non-b-lactamase-dependent resistance mechanism that may render the use of current first-line treatment antibiotics, such as amoxy-clavulanic acid and second-generation cephalosporins, ineffective. Worldwide, b-lactamase production accounts for the majority of H. influenzae ampicillin resistance. Mutations in penicillin-binding proteins are another b-lactam resistance mechanism. These H. influenzae strains are called b-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant or BLNAR. BLNAR strains are less susceptible to ampicillin but also to amoxyclavulanate and to second-or third-generation cephalosporins. BLNAR strains were, until now, rare and increases in minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were limited, making use of aminopenicillins in high doses still warranted. This situation is changing. Most notably, for example, BLNAR strains have increased significantly in Japan. Similarly, in some European countries (Spain and France), an increasing prevalence of BLNAR is also seen. Some of these strains have increased MIC values that make treatment with aminopenicillins or second-or third-generation cephalosporins ineffective. A further increase of BLNAR strains might challenge our current guidelines for treatment of RTI that advocate use of amoxy-clavulanate or second-generation cephalosporins as first-line treatment options. Based on the observed effects of PCV7, the possible clinical implications of new vaccines should be explored.\n\nIn order to monitor the impact of Hib vaccination on the epidemiology of invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease, an international collaboration S44 20th ECCMID, Oral presentations was established in 1996. By 2006, 28 countries had responded and provided national surveillance data on invasive H. influenzae.1 By 2000, 14 of these countries had incorporated the Hib conjugate vaccine into their infant immunization schedules and routinely serotyped all clinical H. influenzae isolates. A total of 10,081 H. influenzae infections were reported between 2000 and 2006;2 of these, 2836 (28%) were due to Hib and 4466 (44%) to non-typeable H. Influenza (NTHi). It was found that the incidence of NTHi was almost twice that of Hib (0.28 versus 0.15 per 100,000 cases) and that both Hib and NTHi infections were more common in infants and the elderly. Moreover, the incidence of NTHi was much higher than Hib in the first month of life (11.4 versus 1.2 per 100,000 cases) and infections were more likely to occur in the first week of life, suggesting vertically acquired infection. Overall, however, the median age at disease was higher for NTHi infections than for Hib (58 years versus 5 years, p < 0.0001). NTHi infections were also associated with: a higher case fatality ratio (CFR; 366/3172 [11.5%] versus 88/2005 [4.4%]; p < 0.0001), particularly among infants (17.4% versus 2.9%; p < 0.0001); and a higher proportion of NTHi infections among women of child-bearing age. In addition, one-third of reported meningitis cases were due to NTHi. The CFRs for Hib and NTHi meningitis were similar in EU-IBIS data (4.1% versus 4.2%) but in England and Wales, the CFR was much higher for NTHi meningitis (17% versus 5%). The reasons for this are unclear. In conclusion, there is a need for continued, largescale, clinico-epidemiological surveillance to collect data on clinical presentations of NTHi, risk factors, management and NTHi-attributable death. Reference(s) [1] \n\nThe frequency and diversity of serious fungal infections does increase and severely immunocompromised patients are particularly vulnerable to infection from moulds and yeasts. Candida and Aspergillus species are the predominant pathogens. Candida bloodstream infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality in both neutropenic and non-neutropenic critically ill patients. Risk factors associated are diverse and include exposure to broad spectrum antimicrobial agents, mucosal colonization, indwelling vascular catheters, surgery and cancer chemotherapy. Differences in geographical epidemiology are emerging, in particular regarding a shift towards non-albicans species. This shift has been correlated with routine fluconazole administration. Aspergillus spp. can cause a wide spectrum of diseases in humans, including allergy, superficial infection, and invasive disease. Invasive aspergillosis has emerged as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. The most important species are Aspergillus fumigatus followed by Aspergillus flavus. Contemporaneously, infections with rare molds are on rise. Zygomyzetes, Trichosporon, Fusarium, Alternaria, Pseudallescheria and dematiaceous fungi are recognized more frequently. The emergence of these organisms is multifactorial and can be related to more intense immunosuppression, the prolonged survival of patients, and the selective pressure of broad spectrum antifungal agents used for prophylaxis or therapy. Among these rare mould infections, the zygomycetes are the most commonly encountered, and appear to be associated with the use of voriconazole. Aspergillus terreus, a species that is resistant to amphotericin B, and less frequently, A. ustus and A. lentulus, have been noted increasingly as causes of invasive aspergillosis in some tertiary care centres. Scedosporium with innate resistance to many antifungal agents have emerged as major causes of disseminated infections, followed by infections due to Fusarium species. Dematiaceous, or brown-black, fungi, most often associated with chronic localised infections, are now increasingly reported as a cause of disseminated infection in immunosuppressed hosts. Watchful surveillance, rapid detection of disease, adequate treatment and effective control measures are highly warranted in the optimal management of these difficult to treat fungal infections.\n\nK183 Impact of the commensal flora on health and diseases\n\nOur adult bodies harbour approximately ten times more microbial cells than human cells and their genomes (the microbiome) endow us with physiological capacities that strongly influence our well-being. However, our microbiome is largely unexplored and there is a great need to increase our understanding of the interactions between our human and microbial genomes. The sequencing of the human genome constituted a starting point in the understanding of human biology at a global scale, yet today there is a growing agreement that human health and disease cannot be understood without considering the microbial communities. Now when the human microbiome project has been launched a number of international consortiums are starting up with efforts to explore the role of the human microbiota in health and disease. Many lines of evidence suggest a role for both commensal and transient microbes in the status of human health as well as for the risk of contracting certain diseases. During the last years molecular microbiology has revolutionized the landscape of microbiology and will continue to do so by providing new solutions for microbe identification and characterization. Nextgeneration sequencing has opened up new areas of research for people in the field of intestinal, skin, oral cavity and other microbiomics. The high-throughput sequencing platforms we now have access to will hopefully also help to increase our understanding of host-bacteria interactions, immune maturation and mechanisms behind chronic disease development. An interdisciplinary approach must be taken on comprising medical, epidemiological, computational, and biotechnology expertise focusing on understanding the human microbial communities and their effect on human health. Application of different \"omics\"-methods and computational systems biology methods to unique biobanks will be required in order to map out the human microbiome as well as the human cellular machinery interacting it.\n\nESBL-producing E. coli in the community S185 How big is the threat in the outpatient setting?\n\nE. coli with CTX-M enzymes are globally the most prevalent ESBL producers. They are often isolated from urines of patients attending general practice, but there are few data to assess accurately the extent of the community burden. The prevalence of ESBL producers in faeces from healthy people is typically <5% in Europe. In a recent multicentre study of non-hospitalized patients with infections, one third of the ESBL producers (mainly E. coli) were from those with no recent health care contact (Ben-Ami et al. Clin Infect Dis. 2009; 49:682) . In the UK, ESBLproducing E. coli cause c. 2500 cases of bacteraemia p.a., and may be estimated to cause c. 50,000 urinary tract infections p.a. Many belong to the globally-disseminated O25:H4-ST131 uropathogenic clone and have CTX-M-15 ESBL, though CTX-M-3 is equally common in this clone in Belfast, a city where the ST131 clone is present in the faeces of 40% of nursing home residents. CTX-M-15 ESBL is associated with IncFII multi-resistance plasmids, while CTX-M-3 in Belfast is encoded on IncI1 plasmids. These plasmids cannot readily be lost even in the absence of antibiotic selective pressure, since they encode multiple 'addiction' systems. Hence ESBL producers may serve as long-term community reservoirs of resistance genes. Foreign travel may also be associated\n\nwith gut colonization by ESBL-producing isolates, and the ESBL present often reflects the type most prevalent in the countries visited. Food remains an under-explored potential source for ESBL-producing E. coli. Raw chicken has been sampled in the UK, with CTX-M group 2 and 8 ESBLs found in meat imported from South America; these types account for <1% of ESBLs from clinical infections. There are currently no data to suggest wide presence of CTX-M-15 ESBL in foodstuffs; it may be found in E. coli from animals, but the strains are usually distinct from the dominant human clinical types. ESBL producers are often multiresistant. Carbapenems are the drugs of choice for serious infections, but resistance may emerge in strains with reduced permeability, as observed in a UK nursing home resident who had no recent hospitalization or carbapenem exposure. Carbapenemase-producing E. coli are rare, although isolates with NDM-1 metallo-carbapenemase in addition to CTX-M-15 and acquired AmpC enzymes give cause for concern lest they become as prevalent as those with 'traditional' CTX-M-15 enzyme, or follow them into the community setting. S186 How does changing epidemiology alter our management and prevention strategies?\n\nSince 2000 Escherichia coli producing CTX-M enzymes (especially CTX-M-15) have emerged worldwide as important causes of communityonset urinary tract (UTIs) and blood stream infections due to extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria. Molecular epidemiology studies suggested that the sudden worldwide increase of CTX-M-15-producing E. coli is mostly due to a single clone named ST131 and that foreign travel to high-risk areas such as the Indian subcontinent might play in part a role in spread of this clone across different continents. The carbapenems are widely regarded as the drugs of choice for the treatment of severe infections due to ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae Empiric antibiotic coverage for these resistant organisms should be considered in community patients presenting with sepsis involving the urinary tract especially in patients with certain risk factors such recent antibiotic use, residence in a longterm care facility, recent hospitalization, males older than 65 years and recent travel to a high-risk area. Failure to initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy from the start appears to be responsible for higher patient mortality. Studies from different parts of the world shows that that up to 5 percent of the population in the community can be rectally colonized by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae but the large scale introduction of these bacteria into the hospital setting has not yet been demonstrated. However higher rates of colonization with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae are present in household contacts of patients with infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, residents from nursing homes or long-term care centers. Preventing the spread of these bacteria and managing infections caused by ESBLproducing E. coli from the community remain difficult and controversial issues.\n\nThe integrated diagnostic platform versus the stand-alone microbiology laboratory S188 The integrated diagnostic platform\n\nClinical microbiology is subject to rapid evolution due to the need for rapid and more complex diagnostics, the increasing difficulty in recruiting trained personnel as well at the medical as at the technical level, the need for proven cost-efficiency and the increasing overhead costs associated with quality control. On the other side, there are new opportunities following the introduction of new techniques such as PCR, MALDI-TOF and in particular the availability of automated inoculation and plate reading systems to replace manual labour. Reactions to these challenges differ, ranging from outsourcing to non-hospital based specialized microbiology labs to various forms of cooperation between smaller labs. This cooperation can exist in centralizing a part of or almost all activity in a central hospital-based lab or can be a network with a division of labor between collaborating labs. All these solutions share one factor. By increasing size, they seek to increase cost-efficiency and facilitate the introduction of new, specialized and expensive techniques. Outsourcing is often rejected because it risks reducing microbiology to a purely analytical activity with little microbiologist-dependent added-value. Concentrating smaller microbiology labs in one central lab or networking may not always be possible for practical reasons and will again increase the distance between clinical microbiologists and some of the microbiological tests. A solution that can assure a sufficient lab size even in mediumsized hospitals without the need for collaboration with other labs or outsourcing is integration of the microbiology lab with other pathology labs such as clinical chemistry or clinical hematology. This kind of integration can combine economy of scale with conserving the microbiological activity within the hospital and thus the close link between microbiology and infectious disease and infection control specialists. Integration of laboratories in its simplest form can exist in sharing of machines and lab space. It can also lead to an integration of all diagnostic activity according to common workflows. An example is an integrated unit for molecular testing performing all nucleic acid based testing; microbiological, hematological but also human genetics or forensic medicine. This integrated lab demands new ways of organizing lab activity. Essential to the integrated lab is a separation of medical and technical expertise and medical and organizational responsibility.\n\nFollowing allogeneic stem cell transplantation, patients have profound and prolonged immunosuppression. This is most severe after HLA mismatched transplants that require extensive T cell depletion to prevent graft-versus-host disease, and in recipients of cord blood transplants, which contain few memory T-lymphocytes. The consequence is a high morbidity and mortality from infection and disease relapse. We have been developing two approaches to repopulate the immune system following transplantation to reduce both types of risk. Our first approach is to isolate viral and fungal antigen reactive T lymphocytes from donor blood and expand them ex vivo before infusing them into the stem cell recipients. We have generated T lymphocytes that are specific for common viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and adenovirus, and engineer them to expand efficiently in vivo. They have proved effective at preventing and treating serious virus illness in the target patient populations and we are now extending this approach to the treatment of fungal disease. Our second approach is to remove alloreactive T cells from donor PBM and infuse these depleted T cells to produce broad immune reconstitution. As a further safety measure to prevent GvHD from the infused cells, we incorporate a new suicide gene composed of a modified caspase 9 that can be activated by a small molecule drug. Early clinical results show high safety and efficacy of the approach. We have also developed tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, using both native and chimeric receptors directed to tumor associated antigens. We express the chimeric receptors in virus specific T lymphocytes, thus gaining the benefit of both an antiviral and an antitumor response from the same infused T-cells. These approaches appear to be extremely cost effective and to have a high margin of safety.\n\nHepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is now considered as an emerging infectious disease in industrialized countries. HEV genotypes 3 and 4 S46 20th ECCMID, Oral presentations are widely distributed in animals and there is growing evidence that hepatitis E is a zoonotic disease transmitted directly or indirectly from animals to humans. It has been shown recently that HEV can lead to chronic infection in solid-organ transplant recipients. Liver fibrosis progression in this population can be very rapid, leading to liver cirrhosis within a few years after infection. Virological tools are crucial not only for diagnosis but also for determining the incidence of HEV infections in solid-organ transplant recipients. Although the sensitivity of EIA tests for detecting anti-HEV antibodies among immunocompromised patients may be poor, the performances of the anti-HEV IgM assays appear to be useful for identifying a recent HEV infection. However, detection of HEV RNA in blood and stools by PCR remains the gold standard.\n\nIn a prospective cohort of 38 solid organ transplant recipients with acute hepatitis E, 58% developed a chronic infection. Two main HEV genotypes were identified by sequencing the ORF2 region, genotype 3f and 3c. The concentrations of HEV RNA in plasma at the acute phase in patients who cleared the virus were similar to those who developed a chronic infection. By contrast, the acute phase aminotransferase activities were higher in the patients who cleared the virus. When possible, reduction of immunosuppressive drugs targetting T-cells in chronically infected patients must be considered as a first-line therapeutic option in order to obtain HEV RNA clearance. Recent data also indicate that pegylated interferon and ribavirin induce biochemical and virological responses in selected populations.\n\nIn conclusion, HEV infection must be considered in the differential diagnosis of hepatitis in solid-organ transplant patients. Improved information and prophylactic measures are needed to reduce the risk of virus transmission and chronic liver disease.\n\nO195 Screening procedures have a significant impact on incidence densities of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in German intensive care units A. Kohlenberg\u00b0, F. Schwab, C. Geffers, M. Behnke, P. Gastmeier (Giessen, Berlin, DE) Objectives: To evaluate the incidence densities (IDs) of methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and screening and control measures in intensive care units (ICUs) participating in the German Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System (KISS). Methods: The surveillance module for multidrug-resistant bacteria in ICUs (MDR-KISS) collects data on all MRSA cases in participating ICUs with the aim to provide a national reference and a tool for monitoring and evaluation of infection control management. The median IDs of MRSA cases per 1000 patient-days (pd) with the interquartile range (IQR) are calculated for all MRSA cases and for the subcategories of imported and ICU-acquired cases from the pooled data of all ICUs as a reference for comparison with local MRSA IDs. In 2008 a detailed questionnaire regarding ICU structure, microbiological diagnostics, MRSA screening procedures, MRSA control measures, infection control education and implementation of surveillance was sent to all participating ICUs. The association between questionnaire results and high MRSA IDs (>75% percentile) was evaluated by logistic regression analysis. Results: 186 ICUs with 298631 patients and 1064246 pd had submitted data on 4730 MRSA cases for 2007-2008 and had completed the questionnaire. Median MRSA IDs in these ICUs were 3.23 (IQR 1.19-5.68), 2.05 (IQR 0.62-4.22) and 0.61 (IQR 0.14-1.35) per 1000 pd for all cases, imported and ICU-acquired cases, respectively. Routine screening for MRSA was performed in 142 (76.3%) ICUs, with conventional MRSA detection methods used in 74 ICUs (39.8%), PCRbased screening in 11 ICUs (5.9%) and both methods in 57 ICUs (30.6%). The most relevant screening procedures and control measures are shown in table 1. Of all variables derived from the questionnaire only the variables general admission screening of all patients (odds ratio 8.2, p < 0.001) and screening of admitted patients at regular intervals (odds ratio 4.9, p < 0.001) were independently associated with high MRSA IDs. Conclusion: Considerable differences exist in MRSA incidence densities, screening and control measures in German ICUs. MRSA screening procedures have the most important impact on MRSA incidence densities. ICUs decide to perform a general admission screening probably because they have realized their MRSA problem. Objectives: Screening for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) became mandatory in the UK for all elective and day case admissions from April 2009 and will be mandatory for all emergency admissions from April 2011. Data to assess the effectiveness of this strategy at an individual hospital level are lacking. We analyzed our screening programme data to determine the number needed to test (NNT) to detect a colonised patient across a range of clinical specialties, and develop a risk assessment strategy for MRSA screening. Methods: MRSA screens of nose and groin were performed using chromogenic agar, with additional sites such as wounds and catheters included when present. In our hospital, MRSA screening data were resolved prospectively to individual patient level as opposed to a commonly utilized approximation using matched census (admission) data. Screening data were mapped to a patient administration system database containing relevant speciality codes. Mismatches where no screening results existed for individual patients were investigated weekly and included identification of patients in specific categories excluded from screening. Screening efficiency by specialty was fed back weekly to clinical teams to drive improved performance. Rates of MRSA positivity and NNT to detect a positive patient were determined for each specialty. Results: For the 12 months from October 2008, the laboratory performed >160,000 MRSA swabs on 51,855 individuals costing 600,000 Euros. Screening efficiency for elective admissions improved from 60% to 99% (2228/2249) and for emergency admissions from 76% to 97% (2996/3077). Overall, 1.2% of hospital admissions were MRSA positive, with 1.6%, 0.7% and 0.6% being MRSA positive in emergency, elective and day case cases respectively. The highest MRSA positivity rates were seen in emergency cases in hepatology (4.3%), interventional radiology (3.7%) and vascular surgery (3.3%). 1.5% of elective vascular surgery patients were MRSA positive. The lowest MRSA positivity rate was in day case orthopaedics where 1,006 patients were screened without detecting a single positive patient. NNT to detect a positive ranged from 24 to >1,006 depending on clinical speciality and admission type. Conclusions: Accurate data on results of MRSA screening can be used to assess both risk for individual patient admissions and the cost effectiveness of screening in specific patient groups, and to enhance the efficiency of the screening process. [1995] [1996] was 0.56 and 0.10, respectively. Neither the level nor the trend chenged after In1. Rates were significantly reduced to 0.28 and 0.04 after In2, and to 0.07 and 0.02 after In3, respectively, and were kept in those levels since 2008. There was no significant changes in the rate of bacteraemia due to methicllinsusceptible S. aureus. The results cannot be explained by changes in the case-mix or antibiotic consumption. The segmented regression model is shown in the table. 20th ECCMID, Oral presentations and the expected value of perfect information on the parameters was high (~\u00a310,000). Conclusion: With no microbial resistance to decolonisation agents, all decolonisation strategies were cost-effective, particularly decolonisation of MRSA positive admissions identified through PCR screens. These models allow uncertainty in decision making to be quantified and highlight parameters on which more information is needed to ensure cost-effective decisions, in this case the probability of progressing from colonisation to infection for decolonised and 'un-decolonised' patients.\n\nFuture high-throughput microbiology laboratory S204 I believe in mass-spectrometry\n\nMALDI-TOF mass spectrometry: a revolution in the identification of pathogens in clinical laboratories. In the management of bacterial infections, identification of the pathogen following growth remains essential to propose as soon as possible the most appropriate treatment before the availability of antibiotic susceptibility. The strategy for most common pathogens requires Gram staining, the results of simple tests such as determination of oxidase and catalase activity and appropriate phenotypic tests using commercial identification kits and/or automated systems. A new proteomic strategy is progressively changing this strategy by identifying bacterial or fungal species grown on plates within minutes. Matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation time-offlight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) of intact bacteria yield reproducible spectrum depending upon strain or species. Using whole viable bacteria we describe here the application of MALDI-TOF-MS to the identification of bacterial pathogens isolated in routine clinical microbiology laboratories. Our aim was, once a primary isolate of a bacterium has grown onto a plate, to identify spectral prints, in the MALDI-TOF spectrum, that can be used to recognize the genus or the species. MALDI-TOF-MS was performed using bacteria obtained from one isolated colony. Over 400 clinically relevant bacterial species were selected. For each of these species one or several references strain was (were) selected to establish spectral prints. For each strain, only peaks that were conserved in the spectra of all 10 isolated colonies and with a relative intensity above 0.1 were retained, thus leading to a set of 3 to 30 selected peaks per strain. For each group of pathogens the database was validated using a set of isolates identified using mostly 16S RNA sequencing. The use of this strategy to identify bacterial species in clinical microbiology laboratories will be presented.\n\nObjectives and Methods: To give an overview over climate change in Europe with some regional examples and the knowledge we have on its influence on the prevalence of parasitic infections with the use of review of literature.\n\nThe northern part of Europe, the Arctic will have three times higher temperatures than the rest of the world due to climate change.\n\nWe have a lot to learn from what is happening in the circumpolar area for adaptation strategies. Parasitic infections as Leishmania, Opistorchis, Echinococcosis multilocularis and alveolaris are expanding along with Giardia intestinalis as some examples. The impact will differ regionally. Conclusion: Given the dynamis and the complexity of climate/sensitive infectious disease, particularly those transmitted by mosquitos or rodents Europe needs to develop and sustain surveillance and early warning systems with a regional focus.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, the world population of elderly will surpass that of children under age 15 by the year 2045. Health resources will shift with population growth; thus, measures to reduce health cost through preventive care are prudent. Illnesses from food-borne pathogens are avoidable if technologies are used to maximize safety of food and water, populations are educated in self-care, and medical therapies are advanced for early diagnosis and treatment. Since selfcare strategies require alteration of usual cultural and habitual behavior, education efforts have limited success with the elderly. Why is it difficult to teach the elderly how to handle food safely and what are the consequences for failure to heed professional advice? Medically, when is a person elderly? When does the body begin senescence and susceptibility to opportunistic infections increase? The aging immune system is the primary reason for susceptibility to food-borne pathogens in the elderly. Natural, senescent immunity is exacerbated by the immune insufficiency of chronic disease and pharmacological therapies common in the population. Immune insufficiency associated with malnutrition becomes a causative factor as the physical and mental capacity of the aging individual deteriorates. Poor hygiene, failure to handle and store foods safely, and inability to distinguish between safe and tainted food may all be consequences of diminished mental or general health. For those in group housing, failure of care staff to heed food handling guidance could affect the health of multiple residents due to wide-spread exposure and immune insufficiency. Yet, acceptance of well-meaning advice to change poor health habits is limited due to lack of trust in the efficacy of the information, information that is contrary to cultural and traditional practices, or the failure to recognize and accept the decline of physiological and mental health. The challenge to the health professional that is providing food safety guidance is to recognize the social, health and mental barriers that control the ability of the individual to act on the advice. The goal is no food-borne illness in the world, but reality is that when preventative care is no longer possible, palliative care must take its place. \n\nThe analysis of bacterial protein profile obtained after matrixassisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) emerged over the past years as a new method for the accurate identification of bacterial isolates. MALDI-TOD-MS protein profiling can be achieved within muinutes thus speeding the identification; it is a cheap technology including the decreasing cost for mass spectrometers; protein profiles and issued identifications are reproducible and robust; and new generation mass spectrometers are smaller machines easily implanted within the laboratory. All these parameters make MALDI-TOF MS the technology to be introduced in any modern microbiology laboratory, including the point-of-care laboratory. Databases, the crucial part of the process, now comprise of most of the bacterial species routinely encountered in the microbiology laboratory. Despite the fact that some Gram-positive organisms remain \"MALDI-TOF resistant\" in part because of underlying taxonomic weaknesses and in part because of database weaknesses, MALDI-TOF is definitely the first line method for the routine identification of bacterial isolates in the 21 century, pushing biochemical profiling and even the gram staining off the laboratory towards the museum of bacteriology.\n\nRapid identification and typing of Listeria species by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen that is the causative agent of human listeriosis, an opportunistic infection that primarily infects pregnant women and immunologically compromised individuals. Rapid, accurate discrimination between Listeria strains is essential for appropriate therapeutic management and timely intervention for infection control.\n\nA rapid method involving matrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationtime of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) that shows promise for identification of Listeria species and typing and even allows for differentiation at the level of clonal lineages among pathogenic strains of L. monocytogenes is presented. A total of 146 strains of different Listeria species and serotypes as well as clinical isolates were analyzed. The method was compared with the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis of 48 Listeria strains comprising L. monocytogenes strains isolated from food-borne epidemics and sporadic cases, isolates representing different serotypes, and a number of Listeria strains whose genomes have been completely sequenced. Following a short inactivation/extraction procedure, cell material from a bacterial colony was deposited on a sample target, dried, overlaid with a matrix necessary for the MALDI process, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. This technique examines the chemistry of major proteins, yielding profile spectra consisting of a series of peaks, a characteristic \"fingerprint\" mainly derived from ribosomal proteins. Specimens can be prepared in a few minutes from plate or liquid cultures, and a spectrum can be obtained within 1 minute. Mass spectra derived from Listeria isolates showed characteristic peaks, conserved at both the species and lineage levels. MALDI-TOF MS fingerprinting may have potential for Listeria identification and subtyping and may improve infection control measures.\n\nMicrobial classification and identification is today based largely upon comparative 16S rRNA sequencing analysis. There is, however, a desire to retain a polyphasic approach as microorganisms are far too diverse to be unequivocally delineated by a single method. Proteomics, in the form SDS-PAGE, MLEE or IEF profiles, have had a long history of applications and have shown excellent congruence with genomic methods such as DNA-DNA reassociation. The arrival of MALDI-MS and ESI-MS has made the study of the proteome so accessible that within less than a decade platforms are now available for clinical applications. Thus, the development of intact cell MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry is Infections in the elderly, new concepts S51 approaching maturity and its uptake by diagnostic laboratories has been increasing steadily. Extensive databases eg AnagnosTec (>100,000 MS spectra), negligible sample preparation and rapid analysis have been the main reasons for its success. The peptides/proteins present in the MS spectra are either surface-associated on intracellular ribosomal proteins, consequently, at present, little information can be obtained using solely this approach to gain information on antibiotic resistance patterns. More in-depth analysis involving 1D, 2D and LC-MS-MS methods are required. Using such approaches, new information on antibiotic resistance mechanisms are becoming apparent and providing an excellent tool to elucidate complex mechanisms where genomic analysis alone cannot provide a solution.\n\nIdentification of clinical yeasts is an important task in the mycological laboratory especially in view of a rising number of patients with respective opportunistic mycoses. Reliable species identification can be used as a first guidance for initiation of an appropriate antifungal therapy. In conclusion, MALDI-TOF MS fingerprinting turned out as a very promissing tool for reliable and rapid (hands-on time <5 min) identification of clincal yeasts with low costs for consumables per identification (<1 \u20ac). This approch was not so much hampered by influence of the morphology of the fungus and cultural conditions e. g. culture media and minor changes in incubation temperature when compared to MS-based identification of hyphomycetes. So this technique facilitates high through put and objective identification of yeasts when using a quality-checked database.\n\nEpidemiological data show that HIV-infected population is aging, mainly as a result of prolonged survival due to potent antiretroviral regimens that can successfully control viral replication, thus preventing AIDSrelated events, but also of a late diagnosis of HIV infection in older patients. No specific guidelines have been developed for the clinical management of older HIV-infected patients but clinicians must take into account several factors that are peculiar of this population, like the presence of co-morbidities, the pharmacokinetics characteristics of the elderly, a possible higher incidence of drug-related toxicity and a different response to antiretroviral therapy. In older HIV-infected population, morbidity and mortality still remain high as a consequence of an increased risk of non-AIDS related conditions compared to age-matched HIV-seronegative subjects. These conditions include cancers, neurocognitive disorders, cardiovascular, liver, kidney and bone diseases. Many factors contribute to non AIDSrelated co-morbidities and they can be related to the population characteristics (e.g. higher prevalence of traditional health-related risk factors like diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and smoking), to antiretroviral drugs (e.g. association between long term exposure to protease inhibitors and higher risk of cardiovascular disease, tenofovir exposure and renal or bone dysfunction) or to the HIV-infection itself (e.g. association between age-related events and low CD4 cells count or higher levels of inflammation markers found in HIV-positive patients).\n\nThe pharmacokinetic characteristics of the elderly are peculiar, with a possible modification of drug absorption, distribution and hepatic or renal clearance that results in a high inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability. Moreover, interactions between antiretrovirals and drugs frequently prescribed for non HIV-related co-morbidities can further contribute to this variability. As a consequence, plasma drug levels can drop below effective concentrations promoting treatment failure or can become high resulting in toxicity. Many data shows that, despite a high rate of virological suppression (usually attributed to high adherence to the therapy), older patients had a significantly slower CD4 cells count reconstitution than younger subjects.\n\nThe causes for such finding could be due to several factors like the late diagnosis and treatment of HIV infection on the one hand, or the thymic involution and immunosenescence during aging on the other hand. Many studies indicated that suboptimal CD4 cells increase is associated to a higher risk of non AIDS-associated morbidity and mortality (for cancer, heart and liver disease) in this patient population.\n\nIn conclusion, as the prevalence of older HIV-infected patients is increasingly growing, additional research is needed to fully understand factors contributing to the peculiar evolution of HIV infection and associated co-morbidities in this age group, in order to optimize the clinical care of this population.\n\nAdvances in health care have conduced in developed countries to an aging population. Long-term care facilities (LTCF) are institutions which provide heath care to people unable to manage themselves in the community. Most residents are elder and have multiple comorbidities.\n\nResidents will stay at LTCF for months or years. Hence, comfort, dignity and socialization are important issues. In order to control costs, many post-acute patients who used to stay in acute care hospitals for a long time, are now currently transferred to LTCF. This situation has led to the necessity of invasive devices such as urinary and vascular catheters and feeding tubes. This fact increases the incidence of nosocomial infections, as does the one observed in hospitals. Several significant differences can be pointed out between hospitals and LTCF; most notably the nurse-patient ratio, the availability of microbiological cultures, laboratory and diagnostic equipment on site and the access to costly antibiotics. In addition there are few LTCF with infection control staff. Most of them lack of nosocomial infections surveillance programs and also of antibiotic policy strategies. In general, rates of colonization by multiresistant bacteria in residents of LTCF are higher than those observed in hospitalized patients. For example, some studies have shown that rates of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) carriage among LTCF residents can reach 50%, while in hospitals are generally below 1\u22122%. Although it is possible to detect outbreaks, MRSA infections in LTCF are sporadic, related to pressure ulcers and generally less serious than those seen in hospitals. The prevalence of multidrug resistant Gram-negative (MDR-GNB) bacteria is also high among LTCF residents, particularly among those with faecal incontinence and antibiotic exposure. MDR-GNB is frequently S52 20th ECCMID, Oral presentations recovered from environmental samples and common areas providing opportunities for person-to-person transmission. Clostridium difficile continues to be an increasing problem in LTCF. It is the most common cause of non-epidemic acute diarrheal illness in LTCF. Outbreaks have also been recognized, particularly related to antimicrobial consumption.\n\nIn conclusion, LTCF act as a reservoir of multi-resistant bacteria that can cause sporadic infections as well as indolent outbreaks. A multilevel approach, including antimicrobial policies and prevention transmission measures are needed to limit the impact of this problem.\n\nHerpes Zoster (shingles) is caused by reactivation of the varicella zoster virus. It is characterized acutely by a painful rash, and 10\u221220% of patients experience prolonged pain (postherpetic neuralgia), which in rare cases can last for years and be debilitating. Both the incidence and severity of zoster increase with age. Treatment options for zoster and post herpetic neuralgia are limited and costly. A shingles vaccine was licensed in Europe and the United States in 2006 following the completion of the Shingles Prevention Study, a randomized controlled trial of 38,546 healthy adults; vaccination decreased both the incidence and severity of zoster over a median of 3 years. Primary efficacy was measured by a burden of illness score which combined incidence, duration and severity of pain. The vaccine decreased burden of illness by 61%, but the effects varied by age. Efficacy in preventing acute zoster declined with age at vaccination, and there was minimal efficacy past age 80 years. Vaccination reduced the incidence of post-herpetic neuralgia at all ages by 66%. This was achieved by preventing acute zoster among patients aged 60\u221269 years, and attenuating disease in patients aged 70 years. Side effects were mild, but serious adverse events were more common in the vaccination group (1.9 percent vs. 1.3 percent, P = 0.03). Debate about the use of the vaccine revolves not around the effectiveness, but the cost-effectiveness, as the vaccine is expensive (\u20ac136 per dose). Published analyses have found incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from \u20ac18,500 to \u20ac76,500 per quality-adjusted life year. The vaccine appears to be most cost-effective among 65-to 70-year-olds, as the incidence of disease in this age group is high, but vaccine recipients are still able to mount a satisfactory immune response. Despite recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control that all adults aged 60 years receive the shingles vaccine, uptake in the US has been slow. Barriers to vaccination include difficulties with vaccine storage, variable insurance coverage, and competing priorities for primary care doctors. Since licensure, the cost of the vaccine has increased by 30%. Moreover, studies of willingnessto-pay suggest that current vaccine pricing is not acceptable to patients.\n\nIn conclusion, the shingles vaccine appears to be effective in reducing morbidity, but the cost is high and universal vaccination over age 60 years may not currently represent good value. Objective: To make the genetic screening of tuberculosis (TB) isolates suitable for low-income countries as well as endemic countries with high prevalence/incidence of drug-resistant TB. The emerging epidemic of drug-resistant TB calls for rapid diagnosis and early detection of drug resistance. This allows immediate and appropriate treatment of the patient and could thereby reduce the spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) or extensively drug resistant TB (XDR-TB).\n\nWe have recently developed an MTB-specific multiplex assay, based on Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA). This method allows simultaneous detection of multiple dispersed DR mutations and genotype-specific mutations in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) genome and has proved to be highly specific.\n\nThe current read-out of MLPA is done by capillary electrophoresis, a method that is expensive and time-consuming and therefore difficult to implement and sustain in low-income countries. Recent developments in biotechnology have raised the opportunity to transfer the assay to a liquid array. Current MLPA-probes were modified to be compatible with such a system. To cover the increasing prevalence of MDR-and XDR-TB isolates, targets revealing resistance to several important second-line drugs (e.g. fluoroquinolones) were included in the MLPA assay, as well as additional genotypic markers.\n\nThe newly included MLPA-probes were very specific for the targeted SNPs, allowing the detection of prevalent second-line drug resistance mutations and a further delineation of MTB complex members. The genotyping abilities of the MLPA assay were additionally increased by the discovery of a new genotypic marker. There will be an explosion of SNP discovery in the next years as data from high throughput sequencing projects become available. Methods allowing informative SNPs to be rapidly detected will then become increasingly valuable. Furthermore, we feel that the new analysis method for MLPA will specifically be of added value in low-income countries with high endemicity of DR-TB. The liquid array allows multi-parameter testing and could provide a standard platform for several diagnostic and screening tests, which are traditionally performed by several different methods. Therefore, MLPA combined with this detection system can bring molecular typing of MTB clinical isolates closer to the patient than is currently feasible.\n\nO235 Application of the rapid detection system for M. tuberculosis complex and rifampicin resistance Xpert MTB/RIF in decontaminated respiratory specimens, non-respiratory specimens and cultures L. Deforges, J.M. Le Glaunec, N. Launay, R. Vergne, A. Minaret, M. Marzouk, M. Marmiesse\u00b0, N. Finnstr\u00f6m, P. Legrand (Creteil, Maurens-Scopont, FR) Objectives: GeneXpert (Cepheid) is an automated real-time PCR system which is very easy to use and suitable for emergency use. The principle of the Xpert MTB/RIF test, running on GeneXpert, is to detect M. tuberculosis complex and mutations in the gene rpoB that cause resistance to rifampicin. This is done directly from at minimum of 500 ml of a respiratory sample. After 15 min treatment of the sample all stages of the sample preparation and PCR takes place within the instrument in 1 h30. Some restrictions of use led us to validate this system on various types of samples. Methods: Respiratory samples were decontaminated with NACl/NaOH and 500 ml of decontaminated product added to 1.5 ml of lysis buffer (provided with the Xpert product). For non-respiratory nondecontaminated samples (CSF, pleural liquid and biopsies) the sample volume was sometimes too low. In these cases distilled water was added up to 500 ml before addition of lysis buffer. For solid culture one colonie was resuspended in 500 ml of distilled water, for liquid culture 500 ml of medium were centrifuged prior to addition of lysis buffer. Fifteen decontaminated respiratory samples (PPD) and 24 nonpulmonary samples ( Objectives: Although leprosy is treated by multidrug therapy since 1982, resistance to the first-line drug (dapsone, rifampicin) is described for 30 years and resistance to second-line drug as fluoroquinolones is described since 1997. Since Mycobacterium leprae is not growing in vitro, its susceptibility testing (one year experiment in the mouse footpad) is rarely done. Molecular methods are thus necessary to detect antibiotic resistance in leprosy and are so far in house methods requiring sequencing. Our aim was to provide a commercially based molecular test able to detect for antibiotic resistance in leprosy. Methods: M. leprae strains contained in biopsy skin samples were studied for resistance to dapsone, rifampicin and ofloxacin by the reference drug susceptibility method (the mouse footpad method). DNA was extracted and regions involved in resistance to the three drugs (rpoB gene for rifampicin, gyrA gene for ofloxacin and folP1 gene for dapsone resistance) were amplified and sequenced. The new DNA strip test, GenoType \u00ae LepraeDR, was applied blindly. Results were compared to those obtained by the genotypic method (PCR sequencing) and the phenotypic reference method (mouse footpad).\n\nResults: Among the 91 M. leprae strains, 14 were resistant to rifampicin, 18 were resistant to dapsone and 1 was resistant to ofloxacin. For the resistant isolates, PCR sequencing was 100% concordant with the mouse footpad test with mutation (numbering system of the M. leprae genome) in rpoB (10 S456L, 2 S456M, 1 Q438V, 1 G432S), in folP1 (5 P55L, 3 P55R, 7 T53I, 2 T53A, 1 T53V) and gyrA (1 A90V). Results obtained by the GenoType \u00ae LepraeDR test were 100% concordant with the two reference methods. For the susceptible strains, there were two discordances between the mouse footpad testing and the PCR sequencing: PCR-sequencing showed in one strain a silent mutation at codon 427 in rpoB and in a second strain a serine to cysteine substitution at the same codon, which were both not associated to rifampicin resistance. GenoType \u00ae Leprae DR showed a wild-type pattern for rpoB for these two isolates. Objectives: Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is known as the etiological agent of paratuberculosis (Johne's disease) in ruminants. Crohn's disease is an inflammatory gastrointestinal tract disease in humans, presenting with similar symptoms and pathological changes in the gut as Johne's disease in cattle. Therefore, it was suggested that MAP could be one of the etiologic factors of the disease. The aim of the present study was to develop a MAP-specific real-time PCR assay providing the additional possibility of detecting viable MAP. Methods: A real-time PCR assay based on amplification of the specific Mptb52.16 target was designed including an internal amplification control to identify false negative results. The detection limit was established in artificially contaminated raw milk samples and the optimized assay applied to 96 naturally contaminated raw milk samples. The potential of the real-time PCR assay to detect viable MAP was explored by assessing expression of the Mptb52.16 target in raw milk samples and inoculated Dubos broth.\n\nThe method showed 100% inclusivity and exclusivity when testing 11 MAP strains, 22 non-MAP mycobacteria, and 16 raw milk microflora strains. The detection limit in artificially contaminated raw milk was 2.42\u00d710 1 MAP cells/ml milk. In a survey of naturally contaminated samples obtained from dairy herds with a known history of paratuberculosis, 47.8% pre-milk and 51.9% main milk samples tested positive. Real-time PCR-derived MAP-specific bacterial cell equivalents (BCE) ranged from 1\u00d710 0 to 5.1\u00d710 2 BCE/51.44 ml; the majority of samples had less than one BCE per ml milk. Expression of the chosen target was detected in artificially contaminated raw milk as well as inoculated Dubos broth, thus confirming the real-time PCR assay's potential to detect viable MAP cells. Objectives: The objective of this study is to determine whether the activation of a cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific T cell-mediated response during pre-emptive therapy controls further replication episodes without valganciclovir administration in solid organ transplant (SOT) patients at high risk for CMV infection. Methods: SOT recipients at high risk for CMV infection, those that are seronegative and receive a seropositive graft, were followed for 18 months after transplantation. CMV viral loads (VL) were determined by real-time PCR, and the CMV-specific immune response was characterized by flow cytometry by the detection of CD4+, CD8+ and CD3+ T cells expressing CD69 and secreting IFN-g and IL-2. Preemptive treatment was administered when VL reached 1,000 copies/ml. Once a CMV-specific immune response was detected no treatment was administered and patients were closely monitored. Results: Eleven patients with a median age of 53 years were included. Between 2 and 7 weeks after transplantation, all patients experienced CMV replication episodes that ranged from 787 to 1,432,217 copies/ml. All of them were resolved after administration of valganciclovir. Between weeks 10 and 20 post-transplantation a CMV-specific immune response was detected in all patients. After this, 33 replication episodes were detected, 32 of which (97%) were controled by the host immune system without the administration of treatment (VL ranging from 10 to 31,317 copies/ml). Furthermore, although the number of positive PCR results was similar before and after the acquisition of immunity, VL levels were significantly lower (p = 0.017) after immunity than before with median values of 1,696 copies/ml and 20,110 copies/ml, respectively. From week 39 to week 51 all replication episodes were 1,000 copies/ml and no new replication episodes were detected after week 51.\n\nAnalysis of the immune response demonstrated that IL-2 was secreted from CD4+ T cells significantly earlier than IFN-g (6 vs 8.5 weeks post-transplant; p = 0.001). Aditionally, IFN-g was secreted from CD4+ T cells significantly earlier than from CD8+ T cells (9 vs 12 weeks post-transplant; p = 0.005). Conclusion: Pre-emptive therapy promotes the acquisition of an early immune response after transplantation in SOT patients at high risk for CMV infection. We demonstrate that the immune response elicited during pre-emptive therapy confers immunity to later CMV replication events.\n\nObjectives: Human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) activation, mostly of the variant B, is common after liver transplantation. Most HHV-6 reactivations are asymptomatic, but symptoms such as encephalitis, hepatitis or graft dysfunction have been described. The clinical experience on antiviral therapy is very limited, but based on in vitro studies, the current antiviral drugs effective against cytomegalovirus (CMV), have also activity against HHV-6. However, ganciclovir is less effective against HHV-6B than HHV-6A. The aim of our study was to investigate the efficiency of antiviral prophylaxis, given to the CMVseronegative risk patients receiving the graft from the seropositive donor, in preventing HHV-6B reactivation. Methods: Of 232 consecutive adult liver transplant patients 36 belonging to the CMV high risk group received valganciclovir (or ganciclovir) prophylaxis up to 3 months after transplantation. The patients were frequently monitored for CMV by real-time quantitative PCR and HHV-6 reactivations were demonstrated by the antigenemia test in PBMC by using indirect immunoperoxidase staining and monoclonal antibodies against HHV-6B and HHV-6A. Intragraft HHV-6 infection was demonstrated in liver biopsies by using the same antibodies and immunostaining. Results: During antiviral prophylaxis, no break-through CMV infections were recorded. On the contrary, HHV-6 antigenemia was detected in 13/36 (36%) patients appearing mean 12 days (range 7\u221222 days) after transplantation. All reactivations were caused by HHV-6B. In three cases HHV-6 antigens were also detected in the transplant associated with graft dysfunction.\n\nConclusions: HHV-6B reactivations were common during antiviral prophylaxis after liver transplantation. At least in three cases also the transplant was infected. Valganciclovir/ganciclovir prophylaxis did not prevent HHV-6B infections in adult liver transplant patients. Results: Eleven renal transplant adult recipients were identified as having Caliciviridae infection, including 10 NoV and 1 SpV. All of them were given an induction immunosuppressive therapy relayed by a triple maintenance therapy. The median time from transplantation to symptoms and from then to diagnosis were 21 months (range: 1\u221283) and 30 days (range: 9-154), respectively. All patients had protracted diarrhea, requiring hospitalization and IV rehydration. Vomiting and fever were present in 5 (45%) and 2 (18%) patients, respectively. All but one experienced weight loss with an average loss of 4.5\u00b12.2 kg, 8 (72%) of them presented with acute renal failure. Patient-to-patient nosocomial transmission was very likely in two patients who shared the same hospital room and in whom the same variant was identified. All others had community-acquired-norovirus infection and one in the context of a family outbreak. NoV genotypes found were GI-3, GII-2, GII-4, GII-6 variants in 1, 1, 6 and 2 patients, respectively. Diarrhea was lasting more than 4 weeks in 10 of them with a median duration of 56 days (range: 8-261). Strikingly, diarrhea resolved after mycophenolate tapering or withdrawal in 5 (46%) and 4 (36%) patients, respectively. All patients survived and none experienced a relapse of diarrhea with a median follow-up of 5 months (range: 1\u221217). Conclusion: NoV is a likely underestimated cause of severe and chronic diarrhea in renal transplant recipients. This may delay effective therapeutic intervention that mostly consists in reducing immunosuppression. Prospective studies are warranted to assess the correlation between immunosuppressive regimens, resolution of diarrhea and virus clearance.\n\nP. Biagini\u00b0, B. Dussol, Y. Berland, P. de Micco (Marseille, FR) Objectives: The Anelloviridae family is composed of multiple viral species belonging to the prototype TT virus. Biology and implications for host health of this intriguing viral family is still a matter to debate. In order to better understand the evolution of anelloviridae strains in the immunocompromised host, we performed a molecular analysis of serial blood and biopsy samples from a kidney transplant recipient.\n\nMethods: Viral DNA was extracted from plasma samples using the High pure viral nucleic acid kit (Roche). Biopsy tissue samples were pre-digested using proteinase K, and nucleic acids were further extracted using the same approach. Rolling circle amplification (RCA) using Phi29 DNA polymerase was performed on extracted materials in order to optimise the detection of viral DNA. Anelloviridae detection was performed using a highly conserved PCR system; amplified products were further cloned and sequenced, and submitted to phylogenetic analyses. Results: The evolution of viral strains detected in blood samples was bimodal: 1) prior to kidney transplant (T-90 days to T0), the genetic diversity exhibited by anelloviridae sequences was moderate; 2) on the other hand, multiple variants were detected from T+15 to T+420 (end of follow-up).\n\nRegarding the biopsy samples, although the first sample (T+11) was PCR negative, an anelloviridae sequence was identified in the second sample (T+170). Interestingly, this sequence was identical or nearly identical to a cluster of sequences identified in the blood of the patient before transplant.\n\nThis study suggests that a transplant is able to be colonized by an anelloviridae strain identified previously in the blood of the corresponding patient. It confirms also that major changes in anelloviridae dynamics occur in the blood of patients undergoing immunosuppressive treatments. Precise analysis of biological and molecular data collected in this study is exposed. Five of nine patients developed ELPT diagnosed by liver biopsy and immunohistochemistry. All patients had elevated liver enzymes more than 4 times its baseline, 2 patients had atypical lymphocytes in the time of diagnosis and 3 ELPT monocytosis. Two patients had clinical mononucleosis-like and 3 were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis of ELPT with viral loads of >900 genomes/mL. The patient number 9 ELPT present two events with added diagnosis of acute cellular rejection by biopsy in his second event of ELPT and high viral loads.\n\nConclusions: Viral load >800 genomes/mL accompanied by elevation in liver enzyme values of up to four or more times their normal levels were related to the development of ELPT. Objectives: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection may cause significant morbidity and mortality in the immuno-compromised patient. VZV vaccine induces both humoral and cellular immunity. However, there is no clear correlation between IgG antibody titers and protection against infection. Antibody protection is a function of both concentration and affinity (=chemical binding strength). Avidity is a measure of functional affinity. It has been suggested that studies of vaccine efficacy should incorporate analysis of avidity, since high avidity is a marker of memory priming. The present study was designed in order to answer the question as to whether solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients have a lower VZV IgG antibody avidity, despite having protective IgG antibody levels after vaccination, or not. Methods: The serum samples of SOT recipients were evaluated for IgG antibody levels against VZV and IgG antibody avidity. Twenty-eight patients were included in the study (20 had had liver transplantation, 3 heart transplantation, 5 kidney transplantation) and had received a single dose of Varivax (Aventis Pasteur, Lyon, France) prior to transplantation. The control group consisted of 50 healthy children, 36 of whom had had clinical and serological confirmed varicella infection after wild-virus contact and 14 of whom had varicella vaccination with a single dose of Varivax. Results: Median IgG antibody levels were 800 U/ml in wild-virus infected controls, 810 U/ml in vaccinated controls and 630 U/ml in SOT recipients. Median relative avidity index (RAI) was 89% for wild-virus infected controls, 94% for vaccinated controls and 82% for transplant recipients (p = 0.01 compared to wild-virus infected controls, p = 0.002 compared to vaccinated controls). Conclusions: In conclusion, IgG antibody avidity in SOT recipients may serve as a substitute marker to evaluate humoral immunity against VZV. This is of particular importance in the clinical setting of exposure to VZV when considering VZV-specific immunglobulin and/or acyclovir treatment in order to prevent clinical relevant re-infection and varicella-caused complications as a result of exposure to VZV after transplantation. However, the role of humoral protection against VZV has to be evaluated in long-term follow-up, since also cellular immunity may play a crucial role in defence against viral infections. (32%). Gram-positive organisms were the most frequent aetiological agents overall (43%). Gram-negative organisms were the primary aetiological agents in the early postoperative period (<1 week). In week one post-OLT, 73% (8/11) of BSIs were due to Gram-negative organisms (85% abdominal source). Grampositive organisms predominated after the first post-operative week, causing 70% (7/10) of BSIs. Crude mortality of BSIs was 33%, being highest in the early post-operative period. Among the Gram-positive isolates, 8% were vancomycin-resistant enterococci and there was no methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolated. Among the Gramnegative isolates, 70% were ESBLs and 30% were AmpC producers.\n\nOverall the incidence of BSI at our transplant centre has decreased between the two time periods. In the period 1995 to 2000, 91 OLTs were performed with an incidence of 28 BSIs per 100 patients transplanted.\n\nGram-positive organisms were the most frequent causative agents during this period (60%). Conclusion: BSIs remain a major concern in OLT recipients. An understanding of the aetiology of BSI post-OLT is important for empiric antibiotic choice in the event of infectious complications post-surgery.\n\nIn an attempt to further reduce the incidence of BSI post-OLT we plan to target IV catheter-related sepsis at our centre. The objective was to evaluate a quantitative real time PCR in plasma samples for monitoring active CMV infection in allogenic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) patients and try a new strategy for the initiation of CMV preemptive therapy. We studied 395 plasma samples obtained of 51 CMV infection episodes from 32 allo SCT patients between January 2007 and February 2009. 29 out of 32 received one or more course of preemptive therapy upon positive AG and/or TNAI-PCR results and 6 (19%) developed CMV end-organ disease (4 colitis and 2 neumonitis). All patients were monitored post-STC with antigenemia pp65 CINApool \u00ae , Argene (AG) and conventional quantitative PCR, COBAS \u00ae Amplicor \u00ae CMV after automatic extraction COBAS \u00ae Ampliprep \u00ae TNAI kit, Roche (TNAI-PCR). A positive sample was defined by AG 2/4\u00d710 5 PMNs and/or TNAI-PCR 600 copies/mL.All samples were retrospectively tested using a real time PCR Affigene \u00ae CMV trender after automatic DNA extraction with NucliSENS \u00ae easyMAG \u00ae , bioM\u00e9rieux (rt-PCR); data lower than 57 copies/ml were considered as negative. An episode was defined as the period between the first positive sample by antigenemia and/or TNAI-PCR, until the first negative sample by both techniques. Invasive Candida infections occur in many different patient populations.\n\nCritical care is widely acknowledged as an important predisposing factor, with a third of candidaemia episodes occurring in the ICU. This is chiefly because ICU patients are exposed to many of the risk factors, which include compromises to natural barriers of infection; Candida colonisation and alterations in normal flora; and the presence of debilitating diseases or immunosuppression, particularly neutropenia. Invasive Candida infections also occur outside the ICU, as the cardinal risk factors are present in a variety of patient types, including patients undergoing major abdominal surgery; bone marrow and solid-organ transplant patients; and patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy. Although risk factors for invasive Candida infections are well characterised, definitive diagnosis remains problematic due to the long lead times associated with blood culture and histopathology. Targeted treatment, i.e. selection of an antifungal agent tailored to a particular Candida species with known antifungal susceptibility, is rarely possible initially. Consequently, pre-emptive and empirical strategies, which make use of the limited information available to guide treatment decisions, are commonly employed. Patients with invasive Candida infections are often severely ill prior to developing a fungal infection. Therefore, rapid initiation of therapy is vital, as the risk of mortality increases significantly with any delay in treatment. However, it is also important to consider carefully the choice of agent, as differences exist in microbiological and clinical efficacy. Many cases of invasive Candida infections are caused by species that are potentially resistant to older antifungals, particularly fluconazole. Therefore, if the causative agent is unknown, or is suspected to be a fluconazole-resistant species (i.e. C. glabrata or C. krusei), a broadspectrum antifungal agent should be selected first-line, with recent guidelines recommending echinocandins as the best overall choice. Differences also exist between the echinocandins, particularly with regard to their suitability for use in certain patient populations. Therefore, careful assessment of individual cases is the optimal basis for selection of therapy. Micafungin, which was evaluated in an extensive clinical trial programme and has to date been administered in 600,000 patients worldwide, is a recognised treatment option.\n\nIntravascular catheters are indispensable in current medical practice. However, they provide surfaces for microbial colonisation and biofilm formation and predispose patients to bacteraemia. Some of the most common causative pathogens, such as coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus, have adherence properties that are important in the pathogenesis of catheter-related infections. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant pathogens, the need for rapidly effective empiric therapy to avoid complications and improve outcomes and the altered pharmacokinetics of septic patients make bacteraemia a significant clinical challenge. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recently published updated guidelines for the management of catheter-related bacteraemia.\n\nCatheter removal and prompt systemic antibiotic therapy are central to both complicated and uncomplicated bacteraemia management. The IDSA and other guidelines highlight ongoing clinical challenges, which more recent antibiotics are helping to address. For example, clinical evidence of reduced MRSA susceptibility to vancomycin has prompted the IDSA to recommend daptomycin* in institutions where vancomycin MICs >2 mg/ml are common. Bacteraemia caused by vancomycinresistant enterococci is also of increasing concern. Therapeutic options are limited and recent novel antibiotics may be helpful in these cases. Haemodialysis patients have particular risk factors for catheterassociated bacteraemia. Catheter removal may pose logistical problems; however, failure or delay in removal increases the risk of haematogenous spread. Compared with catheter retention, removal of S. aureus-infected catheters is associated with a more rapid response to therapy and/or a higher cure rate. Furthermore, success rates for catheter salvage using adjunctive antibiotic lock therapy are lower for Gram-positive pathogens, such as S. aureus, enterococci and Staphylococcus epidermidis, than for Gram-negative infections. The IDSA provides dosage recommendations for daptomycin and linezolid for dialysis patients. This presentation will discuss these and other topical clinical challenges in the management of catheter-related bacteraemia. *Daptomycin is licensed in Europe for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infection (cSSTI), for S. aureus right-sided infective endocarditis (RIE) and for S. aureus bacteraemia when associated with cSSTI or RIE.\n\nPatients with Gram-positive non-catheter-related bacteraemia are at high risk of septic metastases, particularly in bones and joints (especially if prostheses are present), the epidural space, intervertebral discs and cardiac valves. The presentation of non-catheter-related bacteraemia (which includes primary bloodstream infection [BSI] and bacteraemia secondary to infections in other sites acquired either in the community or in nosocomial settings) is heterogeneous and may require diagnosis and treatment of infections in foci beyond the blood.\n\nA dominant pathogen in both nosocomial and community-acquired bacteraemia is Staphylococcus aureus, and S. aureus bacteraemia is associated with a high frequency of complications, including infective endocarditis (IE). Mortality is significantly worse in patients with primary or secondary BSI compared with catheter-related bacteraemia and also in those infected with MRSA vs MSSA. Furthermore, inappropriate empiric treatment for patients with Gram-positive bacteraemia increases mortality risk. Treatment guidelines for bacteraemia are primarily based on specific infection foci, such as IE and catheter-related infections. Empiric treatment for bacteraemia should take account of the likely pathogen and local susceptibility patterns, in addition to presenting symptoms, patients' general heath status and medical history (including risk factors for MDR involvement), comorbidities (e.g. renal impairment) and concomitant medications. When the infection focus is not a vascular catheter, management should also address the risk of complications, particularly related to S. aureus, and the need for some patients to receive prolonged therapy, potentially with initial hospital treatment followed by continued antimicrobial therapy post-discharge. Daptomycin* is one of the few antibiotics with efficacy and safety in the treatment of S. aureus bacteraemia, including that associated with IE. Rapid bactericidal activity, including against biofilms and stationary phase bacteria, and the potential for outpatient treatment with the once-daily 2-minute intravenous injection, are further characteristics of daptomycin that may be useful for non-catheter-related bacteraemia. *Daptomycin is licensed in Europe for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infection (cSSTI), for S. aureus right-sided infective endocarditis (RIE) and for S. aureus bacteraemia when associated with cSSTI or RIE.\n\nProsthetic joint infection (PJI) and osteomyelitis (OST) are difficult to eradicate and remain an ongoing challenge for treating physicians. Until recently, prosthetic surgery was usually approached as either a two-stage exchange, separated by a long interval (6\u22128 weeks), or lifelong antibiotic suppression therapy. The first approach is associated with prolonged hospitalisation and risks of secondary complications; the second has a low probability of success. Antimicrobials effective against slow-growing, stationary growth-phase and adherent microorganisms are needed to eradicate biofilm infections. This presentation will discuss novel treatment concepts and their impact on long-term outcomes and also recently updated treatment guidelines for PJI and OST. The choice to retain or remove an implant depends on the patient profile: in specific groups, implant infections can be cured by early debridement and long-term treatment with antibiotics that have good biofilm activity. Antimicrobial type, doses and duration of therapy will be discussed. Potentially, newer antibiotics such as daptomycin* may prove to be valuable options in implant-associated methicillinresistant staphylococcal and enterococcal infections. Treatment protocols of phase II studies with daptomycin with or without rifampin in PJI and OST will be reviewed as well as the use of higher doses of daptomycin. Common pitfalls and reasons for treatment failure will be outlined. Empiric antibiotic therapy should not be administered before microbiological diagnostic confirmation, which is difficult when antibiotics are administered for a draining wound overlying an implant. In addition, the risk of development of antimicrobial resistance is high, particularly for rifampin. Therefore, rifampin should be avoided if there is contact between the body surface and the implant (e.g. open wounds, wound dehiscence, fistulae, vacuum-assisted closure foam or drainage). Other common mistakes are insufficient duration and/or dose of antibiotics and switching from intravenous to oral agents with insufficient bioavailability or inactivity against biofilms. *Daptomycin is licensed in Europe for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infection (cSSTI) at a dose of 4 mg/kg od and for Staphylococcus aureus right-sided infective endocarditis (RIE) and S. aureus bacteraemia when associated with cSSTI or RIE at a dose of 6 mg/kg od. Recent years have witnessed dramatic shifts in the prevalence and nature of antibiotic resistance. Key changes include: (i) the rise and, in some countries, subsequent decline of MRSA, also (ii) the rise of quinolone and cephalosporin resistance in Enterobacteriaceae, particularly E. coli and Klebsiella spp., with CTX-M ESBLs increasingly the dominant source of the cephalosporin resistance, (iii) the proliferation of A. baumannii with OXA carbapenemases and (iv) the 'loss' of fluoroquinolones against gonorrhoea, with resistance rates as high as 90% in China. Treatment shifts predicated on these problems are now exerting their own selection pressure, favouring the spread of yet further resistances. The greatest concern for hospital medicine is the emergence of Enterobacteriaceae with acquired carbapenemases, including the IMP, VIM, and NDM metallo-types, the class A enzyme KPC and the class D enzyme, OXA-48. At present, Enterobacteriaceae with these enzymes are proliferating in different parts of the world: NDM in India, OXA-48 in Turkey, VIM in Greece and KPC in the US \u2212 but the stability of this distribution is unpredictable, in view of migration and medical tourism. In general, the IMP, VIM and NDM enzymes are spread by plasmids, whilst accumulation of K. pneumoniae isolates with KPC enzyme largely involves dissemination of the ST258 clone. 'Loss' of the carbapenems against Enterobacteriaceae would be a public health catastrophe, in view of the lack of alternative therapies for infections due to multiresistant Gram-negative bacteria. A shift that should be of greater concern than it is presently receiving is the erosion of the antigonococcal activity of cephalosporins. Owing to changes to PBPs, porins and efflux it is increasingly common to see N. gonorrhoeae isolates with cefixime and ceftriaxone MICs of 0.12\u22120.5 mg/L, representing the edge of treatability, again with a lack of convenient alterative therapies. Future risks are harder to predict but potentially include transferable resistance to new anti-Gram-positive agents, and it is notable here that many soil streptomycetes can degrade daptomycin. Such organisms were the sources of several other resistance genes that have spread to mobile DNA and into clinical pathogens. But, as the saying goes, 'Prediction is very hard, especially when it concerns the future' and only two things are certain: that neither evolution nor resistance surprises have stopped yet.\n\nThe use of antibiotics in the hospital setting is shaped by cultural and behavioural aspects as well as by clinical situation and microbiological considerations. An understanding of the determinants of antibiotic prescription is critical to explain current patterns and to devise programs to reduce inappropriate use. Physician behaviour is explained by such factors as lack of information, marketing campaigns to increase use of newer products and fear of adverse outcome with ineffective prescription. Studies of antibiotic use patterns consistently demonstrate frequent inappropriate prescribing and low adherence to antibiotic prescription (ABP) guidelines, a factor likely to increase the emergence of resistant organisms. Behavioural aspects of the antibiotic prescription remain largely unknown. We explored beliefs and perceptions associated with measured knowledge about ABP in two French university hospitals. Physicians in charge of ABP in inpatient hospital wards were asked to participate. Volunteers completed in a same meeting (less than 1 hour): (i) 4 case vignettes presenting infectious situations and exploring 4 aspects: whether hospitalization was needed, initiation and choice of AB, re-evaluation at day 2\u22123, and treatment duration and (ii) a self-reported questionnaire to collect data about their own belief and perception regarding ABP. A global score (/20) was given, combining answers to all 4 vignettes. Logistic regression identified variables independently associated with answers to case vignettes above the median global score.\n\nOf 393 eligible physicians, 206 (52%) agreed to participate: 114 senior and 92 junior physicians, comprising 100 medical physicians, 49 surgeons, 37 anesthesiologists/intensivists (AI) and 20 ER physicians. The median global score was 11.4 (IQR, 8.9-14.3). In multivariate analysis, being a surgeon (aOR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.06-0.38, P < 0.0001), AI (3.33, 1.28-9.08, 0.01), perceiving inappropriate ABP as risky for the patient (3.17, 1.14-8.77, 0.03) and self-perception of ability to comply with ABP guidelines (2.74, 1.35-5.57, 0.005) were significantly associated with measured knowledge above the median score. The participation rate was reasonably high, suggesting awareness to ABP in these hospitals. Case vignettes are a simple method to measure knowledge regarding ABP, and identified surgeons as a job profile for enhanced education. At the individual level, strengthening the perception of the risk of inappropriate ABP and self-ability to comply with guidelines may contribute to better practice with ABP. Further studies are needed to better delineate factors that can help to shape physician behaviour in antibiotic prescribing.\n\nLower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) account for almost 10% of the burden of morbidity and mortality in western countries1. LRTIs comprise a continuum of different severities of infections ranging from typically self limiting acute bronchitis, to more severe acute exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disease (AECOPD) and to life-threatening bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Clinical signs and symptoms, and traditional laboratory parameters are unreliable to distinguish viral from bacterial LRTI. As a consequence, up to 75% of LRTI are treated with antibiotics, despite their mainly viral origin leading ultimately to emergence of bacterial resistance. To limit antibiotic overuse, rapid and more accurate differentiation of clinically relevant bacterial LRTI from other causes is key. A novel approach to estimate the probability of a bacterial origin of LRTIs is meas-urement of serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels. PCT increases rapidly upon infection (3\u22126 hours) and decreases upon recovery. PCT correlates with severity and has prognostic implications. Its kinetics makes it a good marker for assessing the effectiveness of treatment, which is a prerequisite for safe guidance of antibiotic therapy. PCT levels can be used to guide antibiotic therapy in individual patients as a surrogate biomarker. Antibiotic stewardship based on PCT cut off ranges has successfully been implemented in patients with LRTI in different clinical settings. Thereby, initiation or continuation of antibiotics was more or less discouraged (<0.1 ug/L or <0.25 ug/L) or encouraged (>0.5 ug/L or >0.25 ug/L) (Figure 1 ). If PCT values are increased and antibiotics therapy is initiated, repeated PCT measurements are recommended and antibiotics can be discontinued using the same cut-off ranges. This clinical algorithm was prospectively tested in different intervention trials in the emergency room, in the intensive care unit, in primary care and recently, this concept has been externally validated in a large Swiss nation-wide multi centre trial including over 1350 patients. Overall, PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship reduced antibiotic prescription rate by 40\u221250% in patients with acute bronchitis or AECOPD; in CAP, it reduced the initial prescription rate by about 10%, but importantly shortened the duration of antibiotic therapy by 65% with a similar outcome in patients with all severities. Similarly, PCT guidance safely reduced antibiotic exposure by more than 75% in primary care patients with upper and lower RTI9. Thereby, PCT guidance significantly reduced antibiotic-related side effects, especially diarrhoea and nausea.\n\nThe septic syndrome is far too heterogeneous and complex to be reduced to a single cut-off of any surrogate marker. Biomarker must always be evaluated in the context of a careful clinical and microbiological assessment. As the kinetics of biomarkers are of particular diagnostic and prognostic interest, repeated measurements should always be performed, especially if antibiotics are withheld.\n\nEmerging bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents calls for more efficient efforts to reduce the unnecessary use of antimicrobial agents in self-limited and non-bacterial diseases. Embedded in a clinical algorithm, PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship offers great potential to safely and markedly reduce antibiotic exposure and antibiotic-associated side effects. \n\nSince 2000, Escherichia coli producing CTX-M enzymes (especially CTX-M-15), have emerged worldwide as important causes of community-associated urinary tract (UTIs) and blood stream infections due to extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria. Molecular epidemiology studies suggested that the sudden worldwide increase of multi-resistant CTX-M-producing E. coli (especially CTX-M-15) is mostly due to a single clone named ST131 and that foreign travel to high-risk areas such as the Indian subcontinent might play in part a role in spread of this clone across different continents. Clone ST131 that produce CTX-M ESBLs (i.e. most often CTX-M-15 but also CTX-M-3 and CTX-M-14) is associated with IncFII and IncI1 multi-resistance plasmids and certain virulence factors such as malX, ompT and usp. Community-associated acquisition and infections due to enterobacteria with plasmid-mediated AmpC b-lactamases are a relatively recent phenomenon and have been described in the UK, Canada and USA. The spread of clones in the community setting have not been described for enterobacteria that produce plasmid-mediated AmpC b-lactamases. Empiric antibiotic coverage for these resistant organisms should be considered in community patients presenting with sepsis involving the urinary tract especially in patients with certain risk factors such recent antibiotic use, residence in a long-term care facility, recent hospitalization, males older than 65 years and recent travel to a highrisk area. If this emerging public health threat is ignored, it is possible that the medical community may be forced in the near future to use the carbapenems as the first choice for the empirical treatment of serious infections associated with urinary tract infections originating from the community.\n\nA multidisciplinary approach is currently applied to study the acquisition and spread of antimicrobial resistance in clinically-relevant bacterial pathogens: the established surveillance is implemented by molecular characterization of the strains by genotyping, identification of the resistance gene types, virulotyping analysis and replicon typing of the circulating plasmids. Multilocus sequence typing is also used to document the international occurrence of successful, healthcareassociated and community-acquired clones.\n\nMany of these clones are often resistant to multiple antibiotics and multidrug resistance is often encoded by extrachromosomal elements, called plasmids. Plasmids evolve as an integral part of the bacterial genome, providing resistance genes that can be easily exchanged among bacteria of different origin and source, through the natural process of conjugation. The occurrence of the particular epidemic plasmids seems tightly linked to positive selection exerted by the antimicrobial use, incrementing their prevalence compared to that observed in bacterial populations that are not pre-selected for antimicrobial resistance.\n\nMany questions remain unanswered about mechanisms driving the successful dissemination of a specific plasmid type or a bacterial clone. However, the recognition of successful clones and plasmids is an essential first step that may lead eventually to the design of intervention strategies at preventing their spread.\n\nThe class A TEM-1 and SHV-1 b-lactamases are common plasmidencoded b-lactamases in Gram-negative bacteria. These enzymes efficiently hydrolyze pencillins and many cephalosporins but are not effective catalysts for extended-spectrum cephalosporins and thus do not provide resistance against these drugs. However, variants of TEM-1 and SHV-1 that can hydrolyze extended spectrum cephalosporins have evolved in clinical isolates over the last two decades, which has limited treatment options. These evolved enzymes, termed extendedspectrum b-lactamases (ESBLs), contain from one to five amino acid substitutions that result in increased catalytic efficiency of the enzymes for hydrolysis of extended spectrum cephalosporins. Sitedirected and random mutagenesis studies have revealed that the amino acid substitutions commonly found in the evolved variants increase the catalytic efficiency for hydrolysis of extended spectrum cephalosporins and, in some cases, stabilize the evolved enzymes. The evolution of high level resistance involves a process of mutational changes in the active site that increase catalysis but often decrease protein stability. This, in turn, leads to the acquisition of secondary mutations that increase the in vivo half life of the enzyme. The interactions between amino acid substitutions and the resultant impact on the evolution of ESBL activities will be discussed.\n\nAmpC b-lactamases are highly efficient for hydrolysis of many cephalosporins, however, they exhibit lower activity towards extendedspectrum cephalosporins. Nevertheless, AmpC mediated resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins can occur due to high levels of enzyme production or through mutations in the enzyme that result in increased hydrolysis of the drugs. Several amino acid substitutions as well as small insertions and deletions in AmpC enzymes have been reported to increase resistance to extended spectrum cephalosporins and have been associated with increased hydrolysis of these antibiotics. The mutational changes occur in regions in the vicinity of the active site and may act by increasing access for the bulky oxyiminocephalosporins. In addition, random mutagenesis experiments have revealed positions where amino acid substitutions alter the substrate specificity of the enzyme. The impact of amino acid substitutions on the evolution of extended spectrum cephalosporin hydrolysis by AmpC enzymes will be discussed.\n\nThe lung can be easily affected by inhalation of aerosolized mycobacteria and is by far the most frequent site of human mycobacteriosis.\n\nIn HIV-negative patients, the disease is undistinguishable from tuberculosis and is characterized by very slow progression. The manifestations range from absence of symptoms to cavitary disease, and X-ray may reveal fibrosis, upper lobe cavitation, nodular or parenchymal opacity, and pleural thickening. The most affected are elderly patients with predisposing pulmonary conditions (e.g. silicosis, obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumoconiosis, previous tuberculosis, bronchiectasis or cancer). The symptoms include cough, fever, weight loss, weakness and respiratory insufficiency. The NTM most frequently responsible for disease belong to the Mycobacterium avium complex; in Europe, infections caused by Mycobacterium xenopi and, particularly in northern countries, those caused by Mycobacterium malmoense are also quite frequent whereas, in the USA, infections caused by Mycobacterium kansasii are more prevalent.\n\nIn AIDS patients the radiographic picture is often normal or may reveal mediastinal or hilar adenopathy, and the progression of disease is very rapid. The most frequent symptoms are cough, fever and weight loss. The patients have usually a CD4 lymphocyte count lower than 100/mL. In recent years, the widespread use of highly active anti-retroviral treatments has dramatically reduced the frequency of mycobacterial diseases, including the pulmonary ones, in HIV-positive patients. Recently pulmonary infections due to NTM have increasingly been reported in patients with cystic fibrosis. Because of the high risk of contamination of the sputum by environmental mycobacteria, it is estimated that less than 30% of the isolations of NTM from the respiratory tract have clinical relevance. The strict observance of the criteria of the American Thoracic Society is essential for a correct diagnosis. The clinical diagnosis can be difficult even for experienced health professionals, hence the importance of microbiologic confirmation. Four laboratory tests are currently in use: 1. Direct smear of exudates from ulcerated lesions in situ, or fine needle aspirates (FNA) from nonulcerated lesions, or biopsy specimens 2. In vitro cultivation of M. ulcerans from exudates, FNA or biopsies. 3. Gel-based or quantitative real-time PCR targeting IS2404. 4. Histopathologic examination (important in both BU diagnosis and differential diagnosis). Numerous other infectious and noninfectious diseases and neoplasms are diagnosed among clinically suspected cases of BU. Tropical phagedenic ulcer is the most common diagnostic problem. Options for therapy for BU are surgery, antibiotics, or combinations of both. Antibiotic therapy for all forms is gaining acceptance. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends, if not contraindicated, the directly observed use of at least an 8-week course of oral rifampin and streptomycin by intramuscular injection. This antibiotic treatment may also be combined with surgery. Other antibiotic regimens, especially those administered completely orally, are under evaluation. Severe ZN positive lesions (large ulcers and disseminated forms) should receive specific antibiotherapy and should be surgically treated without delay to avoid deterioration of lesions and possible bone dissemination. Objectives: Mesotherapy is an increasing used technique involving subcutaneous injections of minute quantity of various medical drugs for cosmetic or rheumatism purposes. This practice was already reported to be related to infection risk.\n\nIn January 2007, a general practitioner notified to the health authorities and the regional centre for infection control a cluster of subcutaneous infections due to non-tuberculosis Mycobacteria (NTM) following mesotherapy. An epidemiological investigation was performed to describe the outbreak, to identify the source and the mechanism of contamination and to determine risk factors. Methods: The case definition was based on typical clinical subcutaneous lesion associated with positive specimens for NTM. An assessment practice study was performed to determine potential risk factors to be tested in a comparative epidemiological study. Data were collected including schedules of outpatient visits, localisation of injections, and type of injected products. In most cases, the skin over affected lymph nodes underwent violaceous changes, with discharge of purulent material for 3\u22128 weeks. Total resolution was achieved within 6 months in 71% of the patients, and within 9\u221212 months in the remainder. No complications were observed, and at 2 years follow-up, a skin-colored flat scar in the region of the drainage was noted.\n\nIn conclusion, The optimal therapy for this condition is still controversial. Nevertheless, it seems that antibiotics are not very effective in treating immunocompetent children. A randomized, controlled trial examining surgical excision versus spontaneous healing is warranted.\n\nV. Krcmery\u00b0, J. Sokolova, L. Seng Duong (Bratislava, Trnava, SK) Reasons for antimalarial prophylaxis failure include: i. poor adherence to antimalarial agents ii. malabsorption of antimalarial drugs iii. interactions with other medications iv. adverse reaction leading to treatment interruptions v. underdosing the patient vi. in vitro resistance In case of clinical failure standby treatment is recommended, if no health infrastructure is available. Commonly used antimalarials for prophylaxis in travelers include mefloquine or atovaquon-proguanil. In prophylaxis failure therapy with artemisin based combination drugs (ACT) is indicated. Special conditions exist for IPT (Intermittent Preventive Treatment) in pregnant women in endemic areas and children. For long term travelers/residents prophylaxis in hyperendemic areas is usually ineffective.\n\n20th ECCMID, Oral presentations\n\nWithin the past 10 years virtually all malaria-endemic countries have officially adopted artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) as first or second line therapy for the treatment of P. falciparum malaria. Artemisinins have become the most essential class of antimalarials, their impact comparable only to that of chloroquine in the mid 20th century. Spreading artemisinin resistance could therefore have a devastating impact on malaria control efforts throughout the malaria-endemic world. In the current situation losing a single class of antimalarial drugs to resistance may severely impact the ability of many countries to treat falciparum malaria. The concept of artemisinin resistance has been a contentious one for many years, with some authorities suggesting that it was unlikely to arise in the first place. However, recent data indicate that the first cases of genuine artemisinin resistance have already emerged in western Cambodia. We may already be losing artemisinins in selected parts of the world. Our data showing individual parasite isolates resistant to high doses of artemisinins, prolonged parasite clearance times, and reduced in vitro drug response indicate that this phenomenon is as yet limited to a relatively small proportion of the parasite isolates and probably also to a relatively small area in Southeast Asia. Once it starts spreading, resistance to artemisinin derivatives, currently the most essential antimalarial drugs, could very well be the most devastating event in the history of malaria control in the 21st century. Artemisinin-resistant malaria is a new emerging disease that will require new treatment and control strategies to limit the impact and spread of resistance to the rest of the malaria-endemic world.\n\nMicrobial colonization of respiratory tract: does it always predict a nasty outcome?\n\nPneumocystis pneumonia has long been recognized as a cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised populations, particularly those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Pneumocystis colonization is defined as detection of the organism or its DNA without signs or symptoms of pneumonia. Sensitive molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction are frequently utilized to identify colonization. Accumulating evidence suggests that colonization with Pneumocystis may be an important clinical phenomenon. The clinical significance of colonization is not yet fully understood, but it may be important for several reasons. Colonized persons may be at risk of developing Pneumocystis pneumonia. Even if colonized individuals do not themselves develop Pneumocystis pneumonia, they might transmit the organism to others. Exposure to Pneumocystis-colonized animals leads to colonization of normal animals and to the development of clinical disease in immunosuppressed animals. Colonization in persons receiving long-term anti-Pneumocystis prophylaxis may also lead to the development of mutations that have been associated with drug resistance. Furthermore, Pneumocystis may play a role in progression of lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The presence of Pneumocystis in the lungs, even at low levels as seen in colonization, produces inflammatory changes similar to those seen in COPD, with increases in the numbers of neutrophils and cytotoxic CD8+ lymphocytes. Colonization with Pneumocystis has been demonstrated in HIV-infected subjects, and HIV-infected smokers are particularly susceptible to Pneumocystis colonization regardless of CD4 cell count or use of Pneumocystis prophylaxis. Pneumocystis colonization is also increased in non-HIV-infected patients with COPD and is directly related to the severity of the disease. Models of Pneumocystis colonization in mice with smoke exposure and in non-human primates infected with an HIV/simian immunodeficiency virus chimera demonstrate the development of COPD-like changes. These studies suggest that treatment or prevention of Pneumocystis colonization in at-risk populations may be a novel therapy for COPD.\n\nEpstein-Barr virus is a human herpesvirus that is known to infect and efficiently drive the activation and proliferation of resting B cells in vitro. It achieves this through the expression of nine latent proteins. However, in vivo EBV persists in a benign, dormant state in resting memory B cells. The link between these two observations is that in vivo EBV uses its latent proteins to activate newly infected cells in lymphoid tissue so that the cells can then differentiate through the germinal center to become resting memory cells. In doing so the virus infected cells mimic the normal process whereby antigen activated B cells become long term memory cells. At each stage of the process EBV uses different combinations of latent proteins. If at any stage the infected cell is unable to progress into the resting memory state it is at risk of becoming a tumor expressing the pattern of latent proteins characteristic of its particular stage of infection. Thus EBV is associated with several human malignancies including Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, immunoblastic lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and gastric carcinoma. Each of these tumors expresses a different pattern of latent proteins reflecting their origins from specific stages of the viral life cycle. Recently it has been shown that EBV also expresses~40miRNAs in latently infected cells. miRNAs are thought to play critical regulatory functions in normal and malignant cells but the roles of the EBV miRNAs remain unclear. It is also unknown if they are expressed in a tumor specific pattern like the latent proteins. In this presentation I will: 1. Discuss the mechanism of how EBV establishes persistent infection in memory B cells including recent evidence on how EBV usurps the germinal center process to gain access to the memory B cell compartment. 2. Detail how the model of EBV persistence explains the origin of the EBV associated tumors especially the lymphomas. 3. Demonstrate tumor specific expression profiles of miRNAs and a possible functional significance of these expression patterns.\n\nSome polyomaviruses induce tumors in their natural hosts or in test animals. Tumorigenesis by these viruses is effected by a number of different mechanisms depending on the specific virus. Studies with simian virus 40 have shown that this virus targets key cellular regulatory proteins, in particular the tumor suppressors pRb and p53 to stimulate cell proliferation and to block cell death. Our laboratory uses a combination of genetics, proteomics, gene expression arrays and transgenic and knockout mice to understand how the action of SV40 proteins on these cellular targets leads to tumorigenesis. This talk will review this research and present a model for SV40-induced transformation and tumorigenesis.\n\nA. Zivkovic\u00b0, O. Sharif, K. Stich, M. Biaggio, B. Doninger, I. Mesteri, S. Knapp (Vienna, AT) Objective: Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) positive Staphylococcus aureus is an emerging pathogen associated with highly lethal necrotizing pneumonia. PVL is a bi-component b-barrel pore-forming toxin that has been shown to cause cell death in neutrophils. However, the precise mechanisms leading to necrotizing pneumonia are not fully understood and the role of PVL herein is controversial. We therefore aimed to investigate the mechanism by which PVL might contribute to the development of severe lung inflammation. Methods: Recombinant PVL was generated and its cytotoxic properties were verified by patch clamp and FACS. The inflammatory potential of PVL was tested on alveolar macrophages using mciroarray profiling, PCR and ELISA. Signaling pathways were investiagted using western blots and electromobility shift assays. The in vivo role of PVl was then studied in a murine pneumonitis model, in which lung tissue and lavage fluid was assessed for cell-influx and cytokine/chemokine release. Results: PVL rapidly induces pore formation and death of neutrophils.\n\nIn contrast, alveolar macrophages were found less sensitive to the toxic effects and only succumbed after prolonged incubation. Microarray assays performed 1 h after addition of PVL to alveolar macrophages revealed the selective induction of 29 genes upon stimulation. Bioinformatic analysis disclosed the upregulation of NFkB target genes. These data were verified by PCR and on protein levels and suggest that PVL selectively induces NFkB associated inflammation in vitro.\n\nInhibitor studies and gene reporter assays further confirmed this finding. Furthermore, PVL-induced lung inflammation in mice confirmed the inflammatory potential of PVL, as illustrated by a rapid influx of neutrophils and enhanced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines within the pulmonary compartment. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that PVL, beside its pore-forming properties on neutrophils, is able to strongly induce inflammation via NFkB activation in alveolar macrophages, leading to pneumonitis in vivo.\n\nS. Sigel\u00b0, S. Bunk, D. Metzdorf, T. Hartung, S. Knapp, S. von Aulock (Vienna, AT; Constance, DE) Objective: Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is an important human pathogen that causes diverse diseases ranging from innocuous skin infections to often fatal forms of sepsis. During the initial phase of infection specific molecular patterns of S. aureus are recognized by innate immune receptors of the host leading to the induction of inflammatory responses. Among these patterns lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a component of the Gram-positive cell wall, represents a potent immunostimulatory molecule that is able to elicit cytokine release from human peripheral blood in a TLR2/6 dependent manner. Since in contrast to our data, LTA of a mutant S. aureus strain lacking lipoproteins (delta lgt-LTA) has been described by other investigators to be immunobiologically inactive, we investigated the functional requirements for the delta lgt-LTA mediated activation of innate immune responses.\n\nUsing an ex vivo model based on human peripheral blood cells the conditions and cofactors required for the recognition of delta lgt-LTA by innate immune cells were investigated.\n\nIn this study we demonstrate that delta lgt-LTA induced immune activation critically depends on the immobilization of LTA and the phagocytic activity of blood cells as well as the presence of human serum components, which was also observed for LTA of the respective wild type S. aureus (wt-LTA) albeit with a lower degree of significance. Under experimental conditions, conducive to optimal LTA stimulation, we found no differences between the immunostimulatory capacity of delta lgt LTA and wt-LTA arguing for a limited contribution of possible lipoprotein contaminants to wt-LTA mediated immune activation. Interestingly, we found that LTA specific IgG antibodies, here detected in human sera at varying levels, can bind to immobilized delta lgt-LTA and thereby strongly augment delta lgt-LTA mediated immune activation in human peripheral blood. Conclusion: Our results not only suggest a novel mechanism for delta lgt-LTA mediated immune activation in human blood cells that involves an opsonization-dependent uptake and recognition process of LTA but also provide a conclusive explanation for the controversial findings obtained in previous experiments comparing the immunostimulatory capacity of delta lgt-LTA and wt-LTA.\n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa in pulmonary epithelial cells\n\nObjectives: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder with an incidence of 1 in 2500 in Caucasians. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) is the predominant bacterial pathogen in CF and grows within a hypoxic biofilm in the CF lung causing chronic infection and associated inflammation. In this study we have investigated the effects of hypoxia on the activity of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-kappaB in alveolar epithelial cells in response to stimulation with P. aeruginosa. Methods: A549 lung epithelial cells were incubated with heat inactivated P. aeruginosa or specific TLR ligands (TLR2: Pam3CysSK4, TLR4: LPS, TLR5: flagellin) at 21% and 1% atmospheric oxygen. Activation of NF-kappaB was determined by immunoblotting of nuclear of p65 (NF-kappaB family member) and cytosolic Cox2 (target gene of NF-kappaB) as well as by luciferase activity, wereby A549 cells were transfected with a NRE-luciferase plasmid beforehand. Results: Incubation of cells with heat inactivated P. aeruginosa clearly increased nuclear p65 protein level and luciferase activity in a manner that was profoundly amplified by either epithelial cell hypoxia or hypoxic bacteria. Stimulation of innate immunity in alveolar epithelial cells is largely mediated by three toll-like receptors (TLR2, TLR4 and TLR5). Incubation of cells with toll-like receptor specific agonists, primarily flagellin for TLR5, increased NF-kappaB level in a manner which was also amplified by hypoxia.\n\nThese data indicate that microenvironmental hypoxia is a major determinant of the pulmonary epithelial inflammatory response during P. aeruginosa infection. Further investigations of signaling molecules participating in this response will reveal new targets for antiinflammatory therapy in Cystic Fibrosis. This work is supported by grants from IRCSET Embark Initiative and Science Foundation Ireland.\n\nObjectives: Contradictory data have been reported regarding the role of the inflammasome in anti-Candida host defense. In order to address these discrepancies, we investigated host defense against disseminated candidiasis in knock-out mice defective in the various components of the inflammasome. Methods: Mice deficient in caspase-1, ASC, Nalp3 or P2X7 were infected intravenously with C. albicans. Survival, fungal outgrowth in the organs, histology, and modulation of cytokine production were compared in these mouse strains with the wild-type C57/Bl6 control mice. PBMCs from healthy volunteers with or without reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibitor and PBMCs from patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) that are deficient in ROS production were stimulated with C. albicans. Results: Caspase-1\u2212/\u2212 mice and ASC\u2212/\u2212 mice had a decreased survival during disseminated candidiasis (50%) compared to the control mice (87%). Caspase-1\u2212/\u2212 mice had a 100-fold increase in fungal loads in the kidneys of the deficient animals and showed preferential growth of hyphae in the pyelum of the caspase-1\u2212/\u2212 mice accompanied by remarkbly little inflammation (Figure) . In contrast, ASC\u2212/\u2212 mice did not have higher fungal loads, but they showed a significantly stronger inflammatory reaction in the kidneys. ASC\u2212/\u2212splenocytes showed a higher TNF production after Candida stimulation. NLRP3\u2212/\u2212 and P2X7\u2212/\u2212 did not display an increased susceptibility to disseminated candidiasis. Local bioactive IL-1b and INFg in vivo was only affected in the caspase-1\u2212/\u2212 mice, but not in the ASC\u2212/\u2212, NLRP3\u2212/\u2212 or P2X7\u2212/\u2212 animals. In addition, caspase-1 was constitutively active in ROS deficient monocytes and C. albicans induced IL-1b production was not reduced in the absence of ROS. Conclusions: Caspase-1-dependent processes are important in antifungal host defense during Candida sepsis. In contrast to current thinking, these process are not dependent on the inflammasome components, ASC, NLRP3 and the ATP receptor P2X7. These data confirm previous studies in human monocytes showing that caspase-1 activation during Candida infection does not require pathogen-mediated in flammasome activation. ASC plays an important role in disseminated candidiasis, but unexpectedly seems to have a different function in vivo, specifically by regulating TNF production and local inflammation in the organs. Finally, ROS did not play a critical role in inflammasome activation and Candida-induced IL-1b production. Objectives: Amphotericin B (AmB) is an antifungal drug widely used for the treatment of fungal infections, such as cryptococcal meningitis, which is caused by the encapsulated fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. AmB binds to ergosterol and forms pores at the membrane, resulting in cell death. However, other reports indicate that AmB also acts as an oxidant. In this work we have studied the effect on AmB on C. neoformans. Methods: We have compared three viability methods: XTT assay, prodium iodide staining, and colony forming units enumeration. XTT is reduced in the mitochondria by living cells, producing a compound that is quantified spetrophotometrically. Propidium iodide is a DNA-binding fluorescent compound that only penetrates in the cells once they lose the membrane integrity. Finally, CFUs enumeration estimates the ability of the cells to replicate and form viable colonies. Results: While AmB inhibited the formation of colonies at concentrations above 0.5\u22121 mg/L, the cells did not become permeable to propidium iodide in the same conditions, suggestin that AmB has other effects on C. neoformans different than pore formation. When viability was measured using the XTT assay, a correlation with the CFUs results was observed, confirming that AmB exerts its killing effect intracellularly. However, we also observed a \"paradoxical effect\" in which cells treated with high AmB concentrations (4\u221216 mg/L) produced higher levels of reduced XTT than cells treated with intermediate AmB concentrations (0.25\u22121 mg/L). Since this \"paradoxical effect did not correlate with CFUs appearance, we argued that it might reflect an induction of the electron transfer in the mitochondria, as a consequence of an increased oxidative burst induced by AmB. So we measured the amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cells using dihydrofluorescein, a compound that when is attacked by free radicals releases fluorescence. Our results demonstrated that AmB induced a strong release of ROS in the cells, which correlates with the metabolic inactivation measured by the XTT assay. Conclusions: Although AmB can bind to ergosterol and produce pores at the membrane, our results indicate that this antifungal drug induces killing in C. neoformans mainly through an induction of a strong oxidative burst. These findings confirm that Am B has multiple effects on the cells, which suggests an explanation for the low antifungal resistance to this compound observed among clinical isolates. Objectives: The protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi is the aetiological agent of Chagas disease or American trypanosomiasis, which affect near 20 million people with severe consequences in terms of morbidity and mortality. The host's ability to generate a parasite-specific immune response plays an essential role in the control of the evolution and the severity of the disease. In particular, efficient CD8+ T cell responses are required for the immune control of the infection. Heat shock proteins have been characterized as immunodominant CD8+ antigens in several bacterial infections and tumours, but not still in parasitic diseases. The aim of this work is to know whether T. cruzi HSP70 is processed and presented to CD8+ T lymphocytes during natural infection. Methods: Peptides containing HLA-A*0201-binding motifs were selected using bioinformatics, and their binding affinity were evaluated using T2-binding assays. HSP70-immunized or T. cruzi infected C57BL-A2/Kb transgenic mice were used to predict immunodominant epitopes within the protein by cytotoxicity assays. The recognition of candidate peptides by circulating lymphocytes from chagasic patients were assessed through IFN-g secretion tests.\n\nResults: Thirty peptides were selected as putative HLA-A*0201 binders and synthesized. Of these, 16 candidates were selected and their recognition was tested by splenocytes of C57BL-A2/Kb mice immunized with HSP70 protein or, alternatively chronically infected with T. cruzi. No significative peptide recognition was observed in non-infected or nonimmunized animals, and two peptides were significatively recognized by both immunized and infected mice. When the recognition of these two peptides by circulating lymphocytes of chagasic patients was tested by IFN-g secretion assays, both peptides were well recognized by chagasic patients in different stages of the disease.\n\nThe data above demonstrate that T. cruzi HSP70 is an immunodominant CD8+ epitope, which is naturally processed and presented during Chagas disease progression. CD8+ T cell response against microbial HSP70 has been shown to be protective in other infections like tuberculosis. Since currently no vaccine against Chagas disease is available, the characterization of new parasite antigens providing protective responses will be of great value in order to fight against T. cruzi infection.\n\nObjectives: Different clinical trials of killed Leishmania vaccines showed a limited efficacy compared to inoculation of live Leishmania major (leishmanization=LZ) against cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). The reason for the discrepancy in efficacy of live and killed vaccines is not yet known, in vivo and in vitro studies on T-cell function against live/killed stimulatory effect might provide valuable information. Methods: Nine leishmanin skin test (LST) positive donors with history of self healing CL (HCL) and seven healthy LST negative donors were included in this study. CD4+/CD8+/CD14+ cells were isolated from peripheral blood. 5,6-carboxyfluoescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) labeled CD4+ or CD8+ lymphocytes were cultured in the presence of 1:10 of mitomycin treated autologous monocytes and 100 micro g/ml killed Leishmania lysate (KLL) or 2.5\u00d710 5 /ml live Leishmania major (LLM). Cells were harvested after 7 days of incubation at 37\u00baC and analysed for proliferation using flow cytometry. Culture supernatants were collected on day 3 for IL-5, IL-10, IL-13 and IFN-g titration using sandwich ELISA method. Results: In HCL volunteers, upon stimulation with KLL, the number of proliferated CD4+ or CD8+ T cells (at division 4) was significantly more than unstimulated cells (P < 0.001) or LLM stimulated cells (P < 0.05) or cells from controls (P < 0.05 for CD4+ and P < 0.001 for CD8+ cells). Cells from HCL donors showed a significantly higher IL-10 production to LLM stimulation compared with KLL stimulation (P < 0.001 for CD4+ and P < 0.0005 for CD8+ cells) or comparing controls (P < 0.05 for CD4+ and P < 0.001 for CD8+ cells). Stimulation of CD4+ T cells with LLM (P < 0.001) or KLL (P < 0.05) induced a significantly higher IFN-g production compared to cells from controls, but LLM induced significantly more IFN-g than KLL (P < 0.05). On the CD8+ compartment, a significantly higher IFN-g production was observed when the cells were stimulated with LLM (P < 0.05). Results: Dectin-1 Y238X SNP was strongly correlated with Candida colonization in HSCT patients: 34% of the individuals bearing the wildtype allele were colonized with Candida, compared to 85% of the individuals bearing the mutant allele (p < 0.005), necessitating more frequent use of fluconazole treatment (p < 0.01). Functional assays demonstrated a loss-of-function phenotype of the SNP, as shown by the decreased cytokine production by immune cells bearing this SNP.\n\nIn contrast, the dectin-1 Y238X SNP did not influence susceptibility to candidaemia or that of oropharyngeal candidiasis in HIV-infected patients.\n\nThe dectin-1 Y238X SNP is non-redundant for the recognition of C. albicans, and influences mucosal Candida colonization. In contrast, lack of functional dectin-1 is not accompanied by an increased susceptibility to bloodstream Candida infections. TDT analysis showed no association of the SNPs rs2305619 and rs3816527 in the gene for PTX3 with meningococcal disease. Also no preferential transmission of these SNPs was found in the subgroups of patients with meningitis, shock, shock and meningitis or bacteraemia. Patients with meningitis had a somewhat higher prevalence of the A allele in rs2305619 and the C allele in rs3816527, but this was not significant. In addition, no differences were found for number of days spent in ICU or disease severity. During active meningococcal infection, in patients with meningococcal septic shock, peak plasma concentration of pentraxin 3 appeared to be dependent on PTX3 genotype. Patients homozygous for the A allele in rs2305619 had higher peak plasma concentrations of PTX3 than other individuals (P = 0.05). Instead, patients homozygous for the A allele in rs3816527, had lower peak plasma concentrations than AC and CC individuals, this approached significance (P = 0.09) (Figure 1 ).\n\nThese findings indicate that in patients with septic shock PTX3 plasmaconcentrations are in part dependent on PTX3 genotype for the rs2305619 and rs3816527, but these SNPs do not affect susceptibility to meningococcal disease. Objective: Resistance to tuberculosis has been proposed as a mechanism for selection for high rates of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) deficiency. Mechanistically, low levels of this pattern recognition receptor may lead to relatively lower degrees of phagocytosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and protect against TB however evidence to date has been conflicting. We aimed to systematically review published literature on the effect of MBL2 genotype and/or MBL levels in tuberculosis infection, and perform meta-analysis considering its effect on susceptibility to infection. Serious Gram-positive infections are becoming increasingly difficult to treat because of the escalating incidence of multidrug-resistant pathogens, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In order to improve clinical outcomes and to select the most appropriate therapy, it is essential to consider pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters, such as PD targets and their relation to dosing and the use of PK parameters as measures of exposure. In addition, AUC/MIC ratios should be used to predict clinical efficacy, and the relationship between MICs and dosing requirements should be considered.\n\nIn patients with suspected multidrug-resistant infections, prompt initiation of appropriate therapy is an important determinant of mortality. In some European hospitals MRSA strains account for >40% of all S. aureus isolates so it is crucial that the chosen therapy provides appropriate coverage for MRSA. Current treatment guidelines for serious Gram-positive infections, such as hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTIs), recommend the use of vancomycin or linezolid for infections caused by MRSA. However, the role of these agents in the treatment of serious Grampositive infections is still uncertain and there is currently an unmet need for additional agents that are effective against serious Gram-positive infections caused by both methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and MRSA.\n\nTelavancin is a rapidly bactericidal lipoglycopeptide with a novel dual mode of action and a broad spectrum of activity against clinically important Gram-positive pathogens, including MRSA. In phase 3 trials, telavancin has demonstrated non-inferiority compared with vancomycin for the treatment of cSSTIs and HAP (including ventilator-associated pneumonia) caused by Gram-positive pathogens, including MSSA and MRSA. These results suggest that telavancin would be a promising addition to current therapeutic options in the management of serious Gram-positive infections caused by MSSA and MRSA.\n\nThe medical and public health impact of rapid molecular testing (Symposium supported by Cepheid) Despite notable advances in recent years, molecular diagnostics applications for infectious disease detection have yet to reach their full potential. Often performed in specialized laboratories far removed from where patient care decisions are made, specimens usually spend more time in transit than in actually being analyzed, and once samples do arrive in the lab, further delays are incurred by obligatory dependence on batch processing.\n\nThe chief limitations of current molecular diagnostic approaches are not due to the underlying technology, but rather in how this technology is implemented. Real-time PCR is perfectly capable of generating results within a few minutes. However, the processes leading up to the analytical steps are often unwieldy and performed in batches within a high-complexity laboratory environment. Moreover, the requirement for complex procedures ties the availability of molecular diagnostic test results with the limited availability of highly trained personnel. In many cases, medical value of a diagnostic result is tied directly to how quickly results can be linked to patient management and/or treatment decisions. Fortunately, technologies for nucleic acid detection are now evolving in the direction of modern clinical chemistry analyzers, the most successful of which allow for random access, high throughput, and STAT testing capability. In addition, by virtue of the simplicity afforded by integrated, automated sample processing, the technology is fully capable of being decentralized in order to minimize the impact of sample transport on turnaround time. This symposium will focus on the \"need for speed\" in driving maximum medical impact for four different areas relevant to molecular diagnostics \u2212 respiratory infections, group B strep prophylaxis, blood cultures positive for staphylococci, and pre-surgical prophylaxis.\n\nObjectives: Despite increasing understanding, the treatment and prevention of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) remains a major challenge. IFI is an important cause of complications and mortality among hospitalised patients, especially among immunocompromised patients in the haematology setting. The potential of voriconazole (VORI) as primary and secondary prophylaxis for IFI has recently been evaluated in clinical trials in patients with haematological disease having undergone allogeneic transplantation. Methods: In the primary prophylaxis study IMPROVIT (A), patients 12 years were randomised to receive oral VORI or oral itraconazole (ITRA) from the day of transplantation, for 100-180 days; the primary composite endpoint was success of prophylaxis at Day 180 (i.e. survival without developing proven/probable IFI or discontinuing prophylaxis for >14 days during the first 100 days). In the secondary prophylaxis study VOSIFI (B), patients 18 years with proven/probable IFI in the previous 12 months received VORI 4 mg/kg/12 hours IV or 200 mg/12 hours PO within 48 hours post-conditioning chemotherapy, for 100-150 days; the primary endpoint was the incidence of proven/probable IFI during the subsequent 12 months. Results: In A, the success of prophylaxis was significantly higher in the VORI group (n = 234) compared with the ITRA group (n = 255) at Days 100 (55% vs 41%; 95% CI: 6%, 24%; p = 0.0007) and 180 (49% vs 35%; 95% CI: 7%, 24%; p = 0.0004). Significantly more patients treated with VORI than ITRA (54% vs 40%; p = 0.0014) had sufficient days of prophylaxis (median: 97 vs 68 days). While the incidence of IFI was low in both arms (VORI: 1.3%, ITRA: 2.4%), 3 patients receiving ITRA developed IFI compared with none on treatment with VORI. In B (n = 42), 3 cases of IFI occurred: 1 recurrent Candida albicans candidaemia, 1 recurrent Scedosporium prolificans fungaemia (fatal) and 1 new case of zygomycosis, at Day 3, 16, and 66 after transplant, respectively (incidence: 7%). The most common VORI-related adverse events were hepatotoxicity, nausea, headache and hallucinations/visual impairment (<15%). In A, there was no difference in 180-day survival (85% in each treatment group); in B, 11 patients (24%) died (median: 136 days post-transplant) but only 1 from IFI. Conclusion: Based on the results of these prophylaxis studies, VORI is an effective and safe option for both primary and secondary prevention of IFI after allogeneic transplantation.\n\nThe current estimation of the cancer cases that are related to infectious events varies between 18 and 20% and there is evidence that this number is still growing. Besides Helicobacter pylori and some parasites there are mostly viruses for which a causative relation to malignant diseases has been demonstrated. Establishing such a link depends on the epidemiologic profile of the disease and the putative causal infectious agent as well as its biologic properties in experimental cell culture and in vivo models. Often one of the classical Koch's postulates (isolation of the putative agent from the affected tissue) cannot be fulfilled and, in some instances, not even traces of the microbe (i.e. its nucleic acid) can consistently be found in the tumor. The reason might be that cancer is the late and rare consequence of a chronic infection where replication of the infectious agent does no longer take place and gene functions are not required for maintenance of the tumor growth. Therefore a combination of observational and experimental strategies has to be applied to collect sufficient evidence and to initiate attempts for preventive measures that target the infectious agent such as development of vaccines. Examples of classical and innovative approaches will be presented.\n\nThe emergence of extended-spectrum b-lactamases (ESBLs) in Enterobacteriaceae (ENTB) in the 1980s began to alter the laboratory approach to b-lactamase detection in Enterobacteriaceae. Prior to that time, results for b-lactams were reported according to the test result, and specific detection of acquired narrow spectrum b-lactamases such as TEM-1 was not sought. With the arrival of ESBLs, detection and confirmation was considered very important, and the default position arose that the presence of an ESBL in a test clinical strain, whatever the MIC of the organism, required the reporting of the organism as resistant to cephalosporins of all types. Many susceptibility testing methods recommended the use of ESBL screening and confirmation tests on a routine basis. However, a number of issues have emerged routine use over the years: 1. The problem of defining an adequate number of substrates to ensure sufficiently sensitive screening. 2. The lack of simple and reliable phenotypic methods to detect ESBLs in species with inducible AmpC b-lactamases. 3. The failure of current ESBL detection methods to provide advice on the interpretation of a positive screening test but a negative confirmation test, especially if the isolates are \"susceptible\" to extended-spectrum cephalosporins using method-recommended breakpoints. 4. Animal model data showing that the response to treatment of ENTB (measured as in vivo killing) is correlated with the MIC of the strain, and not the presence or absence of an ESBL. A range of recent studies has suggested that failures of treatment with extended-spectrum cephalosporins are likely when strains of ENTB have MICs elevated above the wild-type. Further, application of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles to the most widely recommended dosing schedules of cephalosporins have shown that the susceptibility breakpoints recommended by many methods have been too high. Lower breakpoints for injectable cephalosporins are now published by CLSI and EUCAST, with recommendations to optionally conduct specific ESBL tests, for instance if there is an epidemiological need. These newer cephalosporin breakpoints put us in a position where almost all ESBL-producing and plasmid-borne AmpC-producing ENTB will be detected and reported as I or R with the new breakpoints, and specific b-lactamase testing will not be required. This is appropriate for clinical reports whose major purpose is to guide therapy in individual patients.\n\nIt is argued that treatment outcomes, e.g. for ESBL producers, can be predicted from MICs, irrespective of the resistance mechanism. Proponents of this view contend that it is unnecessary for clinical laboratories to edit susceptibility data on the basis of resistance mechanisms and that these should only be sought, if at all, for purposes of epidemiological surveillance. Several outcome studies support this view (though others do not) and it would have great merit in a perfect world where routine MICs were rapidly and precisely determined for clinical isolates. The reality is very different. MICs, if measured at all in clinical laboratories, are determined, late, on a geometrical scale with four-fold run-to-run variation tolerated for control strains. Often zone diameters are used as a proxy for MICs and, as anyone who has ever run a multicentre discbased survey discovers, these are prone to disturbingly wide site-to-site variation. In this imperfect reality an ESBL producer with a cefotaxime MIC of 1 mg/L (probably responsive to cefotaxime in vivo) cannot be reliably distinguished from one with an MIC of 4 mg/L (probably not responsive) and it is simpler and safer to follow the precautionary approach of seeking the ESBL and, if this is found, reporting the isolate as resistant. A further advantage of seeking mechanisms is that \u2212 using selective primary culture media or chromogenic tests \u2212 they can be found by 24-h post specimen, as against 48-h for a precise MIC. This differential, which is only likely to increase with the coming of molecular methods to detect resistance mechanisms, may be critical, allowing the association between early effective therapy and reduced mortality in severely-ill patients. Objectives: As there exists still some concern about the potential relationship of Abacavir (ABC) and myocardial infarction (MI), and some authors has postulated that the increase in the risk of MI might be caused because of pro-inflammatory state, as increase and decrease of the risk follows quickly the start and resume of ABC, we decided to longitudinally evaluate Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), a widely accepted marker of vascular inflammation and cardiovascular disease during ABC therapy in HIV patients due the lack of accuracy of other markers as IL6, IL8, hs-CRP or TNFalfa. Methods: Eleven consecutive HIV-positive patients starting ABCcontaining HAART were sampled at 0, 6 and 12 months after the start of ABC. Eleven HIV-positive patients on ABC sparing HAART were individually matched for other potential cardiovascular disease markers as hypertension, sex, age, smoking status, cholesterol and diabetes, and were sampled as controls.\n\nResults: There were 4 women and 7 men in the cases matched against the same proportion of males/females. Median age was 42 years old (32\u221254) and 42 (30\u221254) for men in cases and control, respectively and 40 (35\u221246) and 40 (33\u221246) for women in cases and controls respectively. Results are depicted in Table 1 . Values of LpPLA2 are expressed in ng/mL. Mean values for every patient at any given time point were higher than clinical cut points established in 2006 (low risk Lp-PLA2 <200 ng/mL). Interestingly, there was an increase in mean LpPLA2 in all four groups 6 months after the change in HAART, followed by a decrease. At 6 months there were no differences in men regarding ABC, but at 12 months there were an increase in men taking ABC whereas there were a decrease in men without ABC (p = 0.02). Women did not show any differences.\n\nThere is an increase in Lp-PLA2 during therapy with ABC in men, but because there were no MI during the one year follow-up among the two groups, the mean Lp-PLA2 values are more than 3 times higher than clinical cut points and Lp-PLA2 seems to exhibit a \"risk threshold\" we cannot rely on LpPLA2 as a cardiovascular marker in our population. Objectives: Although there has been an increase in available antiretroviral for pretreated patients, their high cost and short time since approved make nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) to be the most widely used backbone. However, since pre treated patients usually harbored mutations in reverse transcriptase, frequently tenofovir (TDF) and abacavir (ABC) are the only NRTI available. Since there are no reports about the combination of ABC and TDF, ans some concern about drug-drug interaction, we made a retrospective review to establish the effectiveness of ABC plus TDF as a NRTI backbone of HAART in pretreated patients. Methods: A single clinic retrospective study including all HIV-1 infected pretreated patients >18 years of age starting ABC-TDF irrespective of their prior HAART. The effectiveness was evaluated in an ITT analysis. Results: Forty-six patients, 31 men (67%) with a mean age of 43 years (28\u221265) and median CD4 cell count of 447 . Mean HIV-1 viral load was 29400 copies/mL (19-85600). Among the sample 12 patients (26%) had undetectable viral load when starting the combination. Failure, as defined, occurred in 26 patients (57%), with 21 patients (46%) having virological failure. The other 5 patients resumed therapy because side effects to any of the drugs (4 patients) or lost to follow up (1 patient). Among these 5 patients, 3 had undetectable HIV-1 viral load when stopped therapy. Median duration of therapy for non-failure patient was 27 months (11\u221254) and 12 months (3\u221233) for patients who resumed therapy. When stratified by viral load at the starting of therapy we found that patients who had undetectable viral load had better chance to keep on therapy than patients who started with detectable viral load 8/12 (66%) vs 12/34 (35%), almost reaching statistical significance (p = 0.061). Conclusion: TDF-ABC backbone should not be routinely used in HIV pre-treated patients. However, if the patient has undetectable viral load, the combination might be used with a high chance of success at 96 weeks follow-up in an ITT analysis.\n\nObjectives: Despite the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the majority of patients, a percentage of patients receiving ART have sustained low-level viremia with viral loads (VL) between 20 and 1,000 copies/mL. The objective of this study was to determine whether the early optimization of the treatment based on the resistance pattern determined in patients with VL below 1,000 copies/ml results in the decrease of the VL to undetectable levels. Methods: Our laboratory has developed a method for amplifying and sequencing the protease and retrotranscriptase genes from the plasma of patients with VL between 20 and 1,000 copies/mL. In this method HIV-RNA is concentrated using RNA affinity colums and is used as a template for high fidelity RT-PCR. The products are sequenced and mutations determined and analyzed. Using this method we studied HIV patient samples collected from September 2008 to September 2009. Genotyping data were obtained for each patient and ART was modified according to the resistance pattern and previous clinical history. Results: Genotyping was determined for 37 patients that fullfilled the requirements of sustained low-level viremia. Resistance mutations were detected in 89% of the sequences. The most common mutations in the protease were at positions 10 (40.5%), 71 (16.2%) and 90 (18.9%). The most common mutations in the retrotranscriptase associated with resistance to nucleoside analogs were at positions 67(27.1%), 184 (27.1%) and 215 (37.5%), while the most prevalent mutations associated with resistance to non-nucleoside analogs were at positions 98 (10.4%), 100 (14.6%) and 103 (16.7%). After genotyping, 17 patients received an optimized treatment regimen.\n\nIn 15 of these patients (88.2%) the VL became undetectable, in one patient (5.9%) theVL decreased significantly but not to undetectable levels and in one patient (5.9%) the VL was undetermined. Of the 20 patients that did not undergo treatment change, in 4 patients (20%) the VL decreased to undetectable levels, in 9 patients (45%) the VL remained between 20 and 1000 copies/ml, in 3 patients (15%) the VL increased to over 1,000 copies/mL and in 4 patients (20%) the VL was undetermined.\n\nThe developed method allows for genotyping of patients with VL between 20 and 1,000 copies/mL. Treatment changes based on these genotyping data have clinical significance since the VL decreased to undetectable levels in the majority of the patients who underwent treatment change. Methods: 195 HAART-treated pts who achieved virological suppression, as defined by two consecutive plasma HIV-RNA measurements <50 copies/ml, from at least 18 months were enrolled. On the basis of RV values, the pts were subdivided in 4 groups: pts with undetectable plasma RNA level (UL, <1 copy/ml), pts with low level (LL, >1\u221210 copies/ml), pts with high level (HL, >10\u221250 copies/ml) and pts with viral blip (VB, >50-400 copies/ml). RV was quantified by an ultra-ultrasensitive method based on a modified Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor 1.5 (Roche Molecular Systems, USA), with a detection limit of 1 copy/ml. To quantify the total proviral HIV-DNA copy number in PBMC, the Real Time TaqMan protocol published by J-P Viard was adapted, with a sensibility of 5 copies/10 6 PBMCs. \n\nObjectives: We investigated whether a rapid diagnosis of TB meningitis at children can be established by interferon-gamma blood and cerebrospinal fluid tests in routine clinical practice and assess the level of agreement with classic laboratory methods.\n\nThe patients have been separated in two groups: first group, where the diagnosis of TB meningitis has been confirmed by positive culture from CSF and efficacy of treatment; second group with non-TB meningitis. We performed QuantiFERON-TB Gold in Tube (QFT-G) in blood and CSF at all patients. Results: From a total of 46 children enrolled, 21 cases has been diagnosed with TB meningitis and 25 patient was in the control group; B:F = 18:10; mean of age was 9.75 (age range 6 months to 17 years). The symptoms and physical examination at the admission may suggest TB meningitis: fever, headache, vomiting and neck stiffness at 17 patients, cranial nerve palsies at 2 patients, hemi paresis at 3, altered mental status at 13 and seizures at 6 subjects. TST was positive at 13 patients in the first group and at 6 in the second. The CSF analyses were suggestive for TB at 16 patients: pleocytosis 300 elements/ml, high CSF protein level and low CSF glucose. All patients had negative smear and only 7 (33.3%) had positive culture. The mean time interval required for QFT-G results was 48 hours and for cultures was 25.6 days. In the first group, the results of QFT-G in blood samples were: 15 (71.4%) subjects had QFT-G positive, 5 (23.8%) had QFT-G negative and one indeterminate (4.7%). In CSF, 16 (76.2%) patients had positive results, 3 (14.3%) had negative and 2 (9.5%) indeterminate. In group of non TB meningitis, 23 (92%) patients had negative results in blood and 2 (8%) positive; in CSF, 19 (76%) subjects had negative results and 6 (24%) indeterminate. The sensitivity of QFT-G in CSF was 84.2% and 75% in blood; specificity 100% in CSF and 92% in blood; the positive predictive value of QFT-G was 100% in CSF and 88.2% in blood; negative predictive value was 86.3% in CSF and 82.1% in blood. The sensitivity of TST was 61.9% and specificity 76%. The sensitivity of the culture from CSF was only 33.3%. The sensitivity and specificity of QFT-G was higher than TST and culture and better in CSF than in blood.\n\nThe determination of g-interferon in serum and CSF is useful diagnostic marker of tuberculosis who could improve the management of TB meningitis, by a rapid diagnosis and an early treatment initiation. Objective: Treatment of latent tuberculosis (LTBI) in HIV+ patients reduces the incidence of TB. Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) may be more specific in diagnosing LTBI than the tuberculin skin test, but their sensitivity at lower CD4 counts has not been established. We studied the effect of CD4 count on IGRA results. Methods: T-SPOT.TB \u00ae ELISPOT assays, incorporating ESAT-6 and CFP-10, and Quantiferon 3G \u00ae ELISA assays, incorporating ESAT-6, CFP-10 and TB7.7, were performed in HIV+ patients with CD4 counts <250\u00d710 6 /L (n = 72, median CD4 count = 124\u00d710 6 /L) and HIV+ controls with CD4 >250\u00d710 6 /L (n = 160, median CD4 count = 460\u00d710 6 /L). Active TB was excluded in all patients. ELISA and ELISPOT responses were related to patient characteristics. Results: ELISA responses were positive in 21% (n = 15) of patients with CD4 < 250\u00d710 6 /L and 31% (n = 49) of those with CD4 > 250\u00d710 6 /L, (difference of 10%, 95% CI \u22122-22%, p = 0.15). ELISPOT responses were positive among 8% (n = 5) of patients with CD4 < 250\u00d710 6 /L and 15% (n = 22) of those with CD4 >250\u00d710 6 /L, (difference of 7%, 95% CI \u22122-16%, p = 0.13). However; when multivariate regression analysis was used to adjust for LTBI risk factors such as origin from countries of high TB prevalence, ELISA and ELISPOT results were independent of CD4 count. Migration from countries with a high prevalence of TB (COHP) was associated with positive results on multivariate analysis: in those from COHP the OR for positive ELISA was 2.7 (95% CI 1.5\u22125), p = 0.03; and OR for positive ELISPOT was 4.0 (95% CI 1.6\u221210), p = 0.003. Injection drug use, incarceration and homelessness were not associated with positive results. Significantly, 17% (7/41) of individuals with no risk factor for LTBI had a positive ELISA, and 5% (2/41) had a positive ELISPOT. 30% (70/232) of patients had one or more positive IGRA result, of whom only 32% (21/70) were positive on both tests. Agreement between the two IGRAs was moderate, Cohen's kappa = 0.37. There was no association between inter-test agreement and CD4 count. Origin from a COHP was associated with a higher level of agreement between positive tests. Conclusions: ELISA and ELISPOT responses were independent of CD4 count. Disagreement between the tests is frequent, and not related to CD4 count. Discordant results are more common in patients with lower pretest probability of LTBI and, given the high rate of positive results in those with no risk factor for LTBI, may represent false positive results.\n\nAims: IFN-g release assays (IGRA) had principally been developed for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and appear more sensitive and specific than than tuberculin skin testing. IGRAs may also offer an attractive option for assisting in diagnosis of active TB. Several studies have been published comparing IGRAs with conventional diagnosis. As part of on-going assessment of TB diagnostic approaches we assessed the reliability of IGRA within our cohort at the regional Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit (TIDU Objectives: Reactivation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is a major complication of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF-a treatment. Thus, screening for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is mandatory before starting anti-TNF therapy. The TST has 2 main disadvantages: the low specificity with false positive results in BCG vaccinated subjects and lower sensitivity in presence of immunosuppressive therapy resulting in false negative results. Diagnosis of LTBI may benefit from new interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA). The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of QuantiFERON-TB Gold In Tube (QFT-GIT) assay and its agreement with TST in the screening of LTBI in patients with an immune-mediated inflammatory diseases candidate for anti-TNF therapy. Methods: We consecutively enrolled 215 patients affected by rheumatoid arthritis (n = 77), psoriatic arthritis (n = 38), psoriasis (n = 64), ankylosing spondylitis (n = 8), Crohn's disease (n = 22), and Behcet's disease (n = 6) were enrolled. Screening included: clinical evaluation, chest X-ray, TST and QFT-GIT. 106 patients were on corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressive drugs and 20 were BCG-vaccinated. Results: Of the 215 patients, 34 (15.8%) had a positive, 152 (70.6%) a negative, and 29 (13.4%) had an indeterminate QFT-GIT result. In 122 (65.5%) patients the TST and QFT-GIT were both negative, in 30 (16%) patients both the tests were positive, while 34 (18%) had discrepant results between TST and QFT-GIT. Agreement between two tests was 81.7% (k = 0.53). A diagnosis of LTBI was considered in 38 cases (17.6%). By univariate analysis, we observed an association between BCG vaccination and discordant QFT-GIT-/TST+ (OR = 6; 95% CI: 2.3-37.1; p < 0.001) and between the immunosuppressive therapy and an indeterminate QFT-GIT tests (OR = 2.79; 95% CI: 1.06\u22127.6; p < 0.02).\n\nNo association between the immunosuppressive therapy and discordant QFT-GIT+/TST\u2212 (OR = 0.16; 95% CI: 0.01\u22121.8; p < 0.09) was found.\n\nOur results show that QFT-GIT may be helpful for screening LTBI in patients candidates for anti-TNF-a therapy not only to confirm positive TST results but also to discriminate false-negative TST results as a consequence of previous long-term immunosuppressive treatments. The performance of QFT-GIT seems to not be affected by immunosuppression in our patients. IGRA appears to offer a better chance than TST for monitoring TB infection during anti-TNF-a therapy. Objectives: Genotypic detection of herpes simplex virus (HSV) resistance to antivirals is based on thymidine kinase (UL23) and DNA polymerase (UL30) gene sequencing. The interpretation of results requires distinguishing resistance mutations from natural interstrain sequence variations. The objective of this work was to assess extensively the natural polymorphism of pUL23 and pUL30 among HSV strains. Methods: Three laboratory strains (KOS, G-HSV-2, MH2) and 54 clinical isolates (27 HSV-1 and 27 HSV-2) were studied. Forty strains were collected from patients who had not received any previous anti-HSV treatment, and 14 strains exhibited acyclovir and foscarnet phenotypic susceptibility using a plaque reduction assay. The entire open reading frame of UL23 and UL30 genes was sequenced. Nucleotide and amino acid sequences were compared with that of reference strains from Genbank: accession numbers X14112 (HSV-1 strain 17) and Z86099 (HSV2 strain HG52). Results: The interstrain identity of UL23 gene ranged from 99.3% to 100% at the nucleotide level in the 57 HSV strains investigated. There were 19 and 11 variant nucleotides for HSV-1 and HSV-2 strains, respectively. Overall, 19 amino acid changes were identified for HSV-1 strains and 7 amino acid changes for HSV-2 strains (that is, 5.1% and 1.9% of the total codons of the protein, respectively). The analysis of UL30 gene showed >99.5% interstrain identity among all HSV strains. Surprisingly, in HSV-1 strains, 113 variant nucleotides were evidenced, of which 72% produced silent mutations, whereas in HSV-2 strains, only 28 were evidenced, of which 32% produced silent mutations. Thirty and 18 amino acid changes distributed across UL30 DNA polymerase were described for HSV-1 and HSV-2 strains, respectively, corresponding to 2.4% and 1.3% of the total codons of the protein. Of note, one HSV-2 isolate harboured a deletion at codons 1106-1111 in the C-terminal region of pUL30. For both viral proteins, 71 out of 74 amino acid changes identified lied within nonconserved regions.\n\nOur results show that UL23 thymidine kinase and UL30 DNA polymerase are highly conserved among HSV strains, with a weaker variability for HSV-2 strains. Beside previously described mutations, a number of previously undescribed natural variations were identified. This work provides the natural polymorphism map of pUL23 and pUL30 among both HSV-1 and HSV-2 strains that will be helpful for HSV genotypic antiviral resistance testing. Based on phylogenetic analysis and genomic organization, hBoV has been classified to Parvoviridae family. hBoV is prevalent in children worldwide and seems to be associated with respiratory tract illness and acute gastroenteritis. One to three slightly different genetic lineages have been reported among hBoV isolated worldwide. The aim of present study is to determine the prevalence of hBoV and analysis of hBoV phylogeny in children suffering from acute respiratory tract illness and acute gastroenteritis in NRITLD, Iran. Methods: Clinical samples were collected from 180 patients ( 17y/o) including 50 exacerbated asthma cases, 83 cases with respiratory tract illness and 47 gastroenteritis cases between 2006 and 2008. The specimens were immediately transported in cold box to the virology laboratory at Virology Research Center, treated and stored at \u221270\u00baC until use. For screening, nested PCR were performed using primers in NS-1 coding region. 10 positive samples were subjected to sequencing for VP1/VP2 gene junction. Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted using MEGA version 3.1.\n\nThe hBoV was detected in a range of 6% to 12.8% in different clinical presentations. Most hBoVs were detected in children less than 3 years of age and in cold seasons. Statistical differences were observed in age group and seasonal distribution of hBoV in asthma exacerbation cases (P = 0.031) and gastroenteritis (P = 0.024), respectively. However, there was high nucleotide identity (99.18%-100%) between all hBoV sequences, the phylogenetic analysis resulted in 3 genetic groups ( Figure 1 ). 14 of the 864 nucleotide positions were variable, when compared to Swedish reference strain (accession number NC_007455), with 10 transitions (71.4%) and 4 transversions (28.67%). At the amino acid level, there was 98.46-100% sequence identity among isolates and only two changes were found at codon 152 (S \u2192 T) and codon 207 (V \u2192 M). Figure 1 .\n\nConclusion: This study is the first research of phylogenetic analysis of hBoV isolated from children with acute respiratory tract illness and gastroenteritis in Iran. Phylogenetic analysis based on VP1/ VP2 gene junction showed the existence of 3 different genetic groups among hBoV isolates that co-circulate in Iranian population. hBoV from Iran was distributed among all three groups and showed that hBoV is highly conserved and there is no specific-geographical variation. The majority of ABMU strains were diverse MSSA containing 3 strains each of spa-types t021 and t314 (15.8%) and the new spatype t4791. The SACU cohort comprised a predominant clone (n = 16; 26.2%) t008-MRSA-IVa, confirmed as USA300-0114 by PFGE and presence of ACME. Other clones included: t044-MRSA-IVc (n = 5; 8.2%); t002-MRSA-IVc (n = 3; 4.9%) and t127-MRSA-IVa (n = 2; 3.3%). Two new spa-types were encountered (1 MRSA, 1 MSSA, assignment pending). Resistant strains (n = 80): oxacillin 45%, gentamicin 5%, tobramycin 36%, erythromycin 28%, clindamycin 1%, tetracycline 18%, trimethoprim 64%, TMP-SMZ 18%, ciprofloxacin 5%, fusidic acid 10%. D-test revealed 36% inducible clindamycin resistant (CR), 5% constitutive CR, and 59% clindamycin sensitive strains in 22 erythromycin resistant strains. Significant differences were seen for SACU/ABMU cohort strains for oxacillin 57%/5%, gentamicin 2%/16%, and tetracycline 10%/42% (p < 0.05).\n\nThere was a striking difference of antibiotic resistance and clonal composition of the two cohorts. USA300-0114 was the most prevalent clone in the SACU cohort and other globally distributed clones were also represented. None of these clones were found in the unselected ABMU cohort. While molecular epidemiologic analysis of strains submitted to referral units provides valuable information, this needs confirmation by investigation of unselected isolates from the same area. A.M. Kearns\u00b0, M. Ganner, I. McCormick Smith, C. Perry, B.D. Cookson, M.J. Ellington (London, UK) Objectives: Whilst the role of PVL in staphylococcal disease remains contentious, the association of PVL-positive S. aureus (PVL-SA) with recurrent skin and soft tissue infections is compelling. Following the introduction of initiatives for enhanced ascertainment of PVLrelated disease in England, we sought to investigate the clinical and epidemiological features of pyogenic skin infections cause by PVLpositive versus PVL-negative S. aureus. Methods: Isolates of S. aureus submitted referred to the national Staphylococcus Reference Unit (SRU) recovered from pyogenic skin infections (boils, abscesses, carbuncles etc) from patients throughout England, Wales and Northern Ireland during 2008 were included for study. Isolates were characterised by toxin gene profiling (including PVL), mecA testing and DNA fingerprinting by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Patient demographic data and clinical features including the site of the lesion(s) and recurrence of infection were analysed. Results: During 2008, a total of 1230 isolates of S. aureus from pyogenic skin infections were submitted to the SRU for characterisation. Of these, 835 were MSSA and 395 were MRSA (68 and 32% respectively). Patients were aged 0 to 95y (median 30y); the male:female ratio was 1:1. A total of 800 (65%) isolates were PVL-positive; the majority of which (523; 65%) were MSSA. Comparison of cases according to PVL status showed PVL-SA were recovered from younger cohorts (median 26y) and were commonly associated with buttock, thigh and/or axilla lesions (50% cases). In contrast, PVL-negative SA were associated with older individuals (median 38y) with lesions from a wide range of body sites, the commonest sites being breast or back (11% each). Recurrent infections were more apparent among the PVL group (30 vs 20% cases). A multiplicity of strains/lineages was identified. Of 10 different clones of PVL-MRSA identified, 3 lineages (USA300, European and South West Pacific clones) predominated. Conclusion: PVL-SA from pyogenic skin infections predominantly occurred in younger individuals, most commonly affecting the buttocks and/or axillae; a third of infections were recurrent. These data have important implications for recognising, diagnosing and managing such infections in the community. O343 Concomitant prevalence of community-and healthcareassociated MRSA among residents and staff of long-term care facilities in northern Israel M.J. Schwaber\u00b0, S. Masarwa, S. Navon-Venezia, Y. Kandlik, I. Chmelnitsky, G. Smollan, R. Glick, G. Neria, Y. Carmeli (Tel Aviv, Safed, IL) Background: Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are important reservoirs of MRSA. We determined the prevalence and molecular characteristics of MRSA among residents and staff of LTCFs in northern Israel. Methods: Nasal swabs were obtained from residents and staff at 6 LTCFs during February-May 2009. MRSA was identified via growth on CHROMagar\u2122 MRSA plates, and coagulase production. Definitive identification and antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by VITEK \u00ae 2. Genetic relatedness of strains was determined by spa-typing, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). SCCmec typing was performed via multiplex PCR, and the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (pvl) gene was tested for by PCR. Results: A total of 191 residents (30% male, median age 85) and 132 staff members (20% male, median age 49) were screened. MRSA was isolated in 14% of residents and in 11% of staff members. The major MRSA strain carried among residents (24/27 isolates, 89%) in 5 of the 6 institutions was a healthcare-associated (HA-) MRSA strain: ST5, t002, SCCmec type II. This HA-MRSA strain was also carried among staff (5/14 isolates, 36%) in 2 of these institutions. HA-MRSA (ST5, t002, un-typable SCCmec) was found as well among staff (2/14 isolates, 14%) in an additional institution in which no residents were MRSA carriers. An additional MRSA strain prevalent among staff (3 institutions, 6/14 isolates, 43%) was a community-associated (CA-) MRSA strain: ST8, t008, with an un-typable SCCmec in 5 of 6 isolates grown. This CA-MRSA strain was detected in only one resident (1/27 isolates, 4%), from an institution in which this strain was found among 4 of its staff members (Table) . All MRSA isolates lacked the pvl gene. Conclusions: MRSA is highly prevalent among residents and staff in LTCFs in northern Israel. Contrary to a priori assumptions, molecular analysis revealed little connection between MRSA among staff and that among residents, arguing against transmission between them. The MRSA strain ST8, t008, with a CA-MRSA phenotype, was prevalent among staff but rare among patients. Two grams of soil/compost were suspended in 5 ml 0.2 M NaCl-1% Tween and 100 ml plated on Sabouraud agar and 50 ml on each of 4 RPMI-1640\u22122% glucose agars containing itraconazole (4 mg/l), voriconazole (1 mg/l), posaconazole (0.5 mg/l) and no antifungal, respectively, and incubated at 37\u00baC. Identification of aspergilli was based on standard micro-and macro-morphological criteria. Aspergillus isolates which grew on the azole containing agars underwent susceptibility testing using EUCAST E.DEF 9.1 microdilution method for itraconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole and b-tubulin sequencing unless they were able to grow at 48\u00baC. The promoter and entire coding sequence of the cyp51A gene were sequenced for azole resistant isolates. Objectives: The emergence of multi-drug resistant Aspergillus fumigatus (AF) causing invasive aspergillosis has raised the question of whether the evolution of azole-resistance has an impact on virulence and therefore on clinical outcome. The aim of this study was to determine whether acquired azole resistance in fungi through mutations in CYP51A or other unknown genes comes with a cost in fitness.\n\nThe virulence study included a) 8 multi-azole resistant AF clinical isolates with different mutations in the CYP51A gene (3 strains with TR/L98H, 1 each with M220I, M220V, M220K, G54W, G138C) b) 3 wild-type azole susceptible (WT) strains as reference and c) 2 isogenic isolates with no CYP51A mutations (1 susceptible and 1 resistant strain) which were serially recovered from a single patient pre-and post-antifungal treatment. Microsatellite-typing method and CSP-method were performed to verify the genetic relationship of the 2 isolates. Susceptibility testing was performed based on the CLSI-M38A method. RT-PCR was performed to determine the CYP51A expression. In vitro growth rates were determined using a previously -Ollivier AAC 2008, 52:3092) , were analyzed by sequencing the hotspot regions of the FKS genes. Initial isolates were also analyzed when available and serial isolates were genotyped using polymorphic microsatellite markers. All medical charts of patients harbouring such isolates were reviewed. Results: For the 14 episodes involving isolates with reduced susceptibility to caspofungin, patients (sex ratio M:F = 10:4, mean age: 44y) were diagnosed with candidemia (n = 8), other invasive infections (n = 4) and oropharyngeal candidiasis (n = 2). Underlying diseases were hematological malignancies (n = 6), solid organ transplant (n = 2), HIV infection (n = 1), and other conditions (n = 5). Candida species were 7 C. albicans, 6 C. glabrata, and 1 C. krusei. All 14 isolates have been recovered after the patient was treated with caspofungin for a duration ranging from 10 days to several months. All had mutation in FKS genes. Among 10 patients for whom a previous isolate was available, paired isolates shared identical genotypes. Furthermore, for each pair, the isolate recovered before caspofungin treatment had higher susceptibility (MIC < 0.25 mg/ml) to caspofungin than the second ones, and had wild-type FKS genes. Conclusions: Caspofungin resistance in Candida spp. was always associated with prior exposure to the drug in severely ill patients. Further analysis should uncover if other factors such as treatment's duration influence its occurrence. Invasive infections due to various species of Candida spp. with acquired reduced susceptibility to caspofungin deserve attention.\n\nO347 Innovative multiplex diagnostics for Candida spp. using MLPA G. Dingemans\u00b0, R. Boesten, C. Klaassen, M. Reijans, J. Meis, T. Boekhout, G. Simons (Maastricht, Utrecht, Nijmegen, NL) Objective: Candida yeasts are the fourth most common source of nosocomial bloodstream infections. Especially during the last decade, the prevalence of opportunistic Candida infections has increased and has become a serious threat to high risk patients. To date, most molecular diagnostic tools are based on ribosomal regions. Although broadly applied, these target genes have difficulties discriminating closely related species, causing misidentification and underestimation of polymicrobial infections. This results in an urgent need of high discriminatory and accurate detection methods for clinical purposes using novel probes. The aim of this project is to improve molecular diagnostics of yeastrelated infections. Methods: A novel DNA based diagnostic system using Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) technology serves as our platform for molecular diagnostics using newly developed diagnostic probes. A Candida-MLPA assay containing probes for C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. krusei, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata, C. guilliermondii, and C. lusitaniae has been developed. Results: The specificity of the assay was validated on 50 Candida/non-Candida spp. from CBS Fungal Biodiversity Centre. In addition, 95 clinical isolates were screened with the MLPA assay and the results were compared with AFLP profiles. In case of any discordance the identity of the strain was established by sequencing the ITS region. Furthermore, the total screening encompassed phylogenetically related species, including 31 Candida spp., 4 Pichia spp. and S. cerevisiae. The Candida-MLPA assay showed a 100% concordance with the ITS sequences. The analytical sensitivity of the Candida-MLPA assay was established on 100 fg gDNA, which represents less than two yeast cells. Conclusions: We demonstrated that an assay based upon the MLPA technology was able to identify 8 Candida spp. in one reaction. Multiple infections, up to 7 species in one sample, could be identified. Due to the nature of the MLPA technology highly complex assays are possible providing room for additional probes like a generic Candida probe or probes for other emerging species. The specificity and sensitivity of this multiparameter assay shows great potential for a fast and comprehensive screening approach for clinically relevant Candida spp. in a diagnostic setting.\n\nObjectives: Defining the specific etiology of a fungal infection is critical to selection of appropriate antifungal therapy. Morphologic identification of fungi can take days to weeks and requires an experienced mycologist. Sequence based identification of fungi could expedite identification but it has been estimated that up to 20% of fungal sequences deposited in NCBI are incorrect. A reliable database of clinically relevant fungal sequences is critical for advancing molecular diagnosis of fungal infections. The purpose of this study was to compare morphologic identification to sequence identification of fungi isolated from clinical samples.\n\nHospital and St. Louis Children's Hospital were identified based on morphological and/or biochemical characteristics. DNA was extracted from the fungi using the BD GeneOhm kit with a 5 min lysis followed by heating at 95 C for 15 min. The ITS1\u22125.8s rRNA-ITS2 region from 133 isolates was amplified and PCR products were bi-directionally sequenced on an ABI 3130. Trimmed sequences were then aligned with sequences in the NCBI nr/nt database using BLAST. Filamentous fungi and yeast from 33 genera and 55 species were included in the study. Results: For 64 of the 133 isolates sequenced, the morphological identification matched the sequence based identification. Morphologic and sequence based identification were disparate in 38 cases. For 31 of the isolates, the sequence-based identification was equivocal; that is, the morphologic identification was found in the top ten \"hits\" in the sequence database, but the morphologic identification was not the first choice or there were other choices that were equal probability matches. Sequence identification performed well for most yeast species, and for some filamentous fungi, such as Aspergillus, Scedosporium and Fusarium spp. Sequence identification was not as accurate for identification of dermatophytes, Zygomycetes, and dematiaceous moulds. Conclusions: Use of the NCBI sequence database for identification of clinical isolates of fungi may result in incorrect identification and administration of appropriate antifungal therapy. Once our data have been compiled into a database of fungal sequences, we will conduct challenge experiments for the identification of clinical isolates.\n\nLegionella pneumophila is a human pathogen that was recognized only about 30 years ago. It is the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, a severe pneumonia that is transmitted through inhalation of aerosols of contaminated water. Shortly after its discovery, the ability of Legionella to multiply intracellularly in fresh water protozoa was discovered. This long lasting co-evolution between the eukaryotic host and Legionella has led to the selection of a panoply of virulence factors, which allow to exploit important cellular processes during infection.\n\nCompelling evidence for the importance of protozoa in the evolution of this bacterium comes from analysis of complete genome sequences. A key feature of the L. pneumophila genomes is the presence of a high number and wide variety of eukaryotic like proteins and protein domains probably acquired through horizontal gene transfer and/or convergent evolution. In the last years several different typing methods aiming in investigating the molecular epidemiology of L. pneumophila have been developed. Furthermore, the access to whole genome sequences of several L. pneumophila strains allowed to apply large scale comparative genomics studies using DNA arrays. A higher genetic diversity among environmental isolates with respect to clinical isolates and the presence of specific clones of L. pneumophila overrepresented in human disease or causing legionellosis world wide, were identified. Recently we applied new generation sequencing to further investigate the evolutionary history and population structure of the worldwide distributed epidemic and endemic clone L. pneumophila Paris as well as the newly emerging clone Lorraine.\n\nWe are interested in the dialogue between intracellular pathogens and eukaryotic host cells. To better understand how pathogens communicate with the host we have been studying bacterial proteins that function in the manipulation of host cellular processes. This lecture will describe proteins produced by the intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila that are delivered into eukaryotic cells by a specialized \"type IV\" secretion system. These bacterial proteins function to prevent fusion of lysosomes with vacuoles containing L. pneumophila and promote fusion of the pathogen-occupied vacuole with endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles. Several of these bacterial proteins modulate the activity of small GTP-binding proteins belonging to the ARF and Rab families. The biochemical activities of these bacterial effector proteins and their specificity for host targets will be discussed. Some 80 million individuals from industrialized nations travel to the developing world each year and it is estimated that more than 200 million people now reside outside their country of birth. In recent years, growth in international travel has been estimated at approximately 6% per year, and European travellers represent the vast majority of international travellers. Travel medicine focus on protecting the health of the individual and protecting the wider community in which that individual lives, works or travels. Initially derived from infectious diseases and tropical medicine, the specialty now encompasses primary care, migrant medicine, occupational medicine, wilderness medicine, as well as international health.\n\nTravelers can spread new and reemerging infectious diseases that initially appear in developing countries, and act as ideal sentinels for the early detection of these diseases. Over the past decade, the global public health community has been facing the challenges brought on by the emergence and rapid worldwide spread of novel influenza strains, SARS, chikungunya virus, and drug-resistant tuberculosis amongst other pathogens. Modern transportation and the growth of tourism, immigration, and business travel were factors that contributed to dissemination of these high impact pathogens. Specialized travel/tropical medicine clinics in Europe are ideally situated to effectively detect emerging infections and to track ongoing trends in travel-related illness and emerging agents in collaboration with laboratories of microbiology. Over the past decade, both global and regional provider-based surveillance networks have emerged that have provided, for the first time, systematic and robust data that define the spectrum of illness and the places of exposure to the most significant health risks that face travelers.\n\nInfection control: zero tolerance? S354 Zero tolerance: an impossible task\n\nWith a declining arsenal of antibiotics to treat infections, it was increasingly clear that the traditional orientation toward control of HAIs (hospital acquired infections) needed to shift to one where preventing the occurrence was the priority throughout the institution. There has to be a global capacity for the political, financial, managerial, and technical support needed for worldwide initiatives. These considerations were all addressed when diseases like smallpox, polio, measles, dracunculiasis, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, Chagas disease, and Hansen disease were targeted for eradication. This model doesn't exactly work for HAIs, because we deal with many different organisms and types of infections, humans are not the only reservoir, many of the organisms are normal flora, and relatively limited scientific and operational resources have actually been dedicated to preventing HAIs. New technologies and procedures, more virulent pathogens and increasing resistance will continue to challenge the healthcare community in its efforts reduce HAIs. If one looks theoretically at all of the infections that occur, one could divide them up into two main groups; some that are preventable and some that are not. The ones that are preventable are preventable through the implementation of practices, behaviors and procedures, and following a very strict clinical pathway. Others are not probably preventable, and that is the irreducible amount. The 'getting to zero' movement is the product of three forces: the expansion of external pressures on infection control programs, the intrusion of suboptimal evidence, and the convergence of quality improvement and infection control. The 'zero' obsession has a number of worrisome, unintended consequences. It sets up unrealistic expectations on the part of the public and healthcare administrators, leading to unreasonable demands on infection control programs. It fosters a punitive culture, since someone must be at fault for causing infections. It separates infection control from safety and quality, when infection control concerns trump other important safety issues. It has shifted the development of interventions away from an approach based on local risk assessment to the promotion of a one-size-fits-all approach. Healthcare workers and hospital epidemiologists have become demoralized when the expectations for getting to zero persist but the elusive zero has not been attained. The concept of \"targeting zero HAIs\" is controversial, because many people believe it sets unrealistic or impossible expectations that all HAIs are preventable and that any HAI that may occur was due to an error or a broken process. Targeting 'zero' is problematic, because it does not address the variation in the risk of HAIs in different patient populations or settings, it does not address the denominator or time frame that is necessary to understand rates of infection, and it inherently seems scientifically unrealistic.\n\n\"Getting to zero\" is a sound bite that misleads the public and is not helpful to hospital epidemiologists. The \"zero\" approach to HAIs is rigid, dishonest, and anti-intellectual, and it dives a culture of blame. \n\nThe emergence and spread of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus (H1N1 2009) from the animal reservoir raises questions on the future approach to influenzavirus infections. We have evidence demonstrating that influenzavirus genes migrate across continents and animal species, and assemble themselves in combinations which are a threat to animal and human health, resulting in panzootics like H5N1 or pandemics like H1N1 2009. The latter contains a unique combination of genes from three species and two hemispheres. In a globalized environment, mapping gene movement across species and national borders and identifying mutations and gene constellations with pandemic potential or virulence determinants is essential to enact prevention and control strategies at a global level. This is in line with, and possibly the best example of, the 'One Health' vision: a multidisciplinary collaborative approach to improve the health of humans, animals and the environment endorsed by the UN Food & Agriculture Organisation, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the World Health Organisation. Vast improvements in capacity building have been achieved as a result of the H5N1 global crisis. Thousands of viral isolates with zoonotic potential have been obtained through surveillance efforts, although the genetic information has not been exploited fully. In addition, the circulation of influenzaviruses in certain species including dogs, pigs and horses has been neglected. Time has come to invest in a novel approach to influenzavirus infections, abandoning prefixed compartments linked to geographical origin or species of isolation, and analyse the influenza gene pool as one entity. We propose capitalising on existing achievements and investments to develop an international network and a permanent observatory which will improve our understanding of the dynamics of the influenzavirus gene pool in animals and humans. This will generate essential information to support both public and animal health. The \"One Flu\" initiative would result in international synergies, bridging gaps between medical and veterinary scientists, permanent monitoring of virus evolution and epidemiology and the best exploitation of investments in capacity building. Above all it could be a challenge and opportunity to implement the \"One Health\" vision, and possibly act as a model for other emerging zoonotic diseases. \n\nP. Levasseur\u00b0, C. Miossec, A.M. Girard, L. Lavallade, M. Black, D. Shlaes, J. Pace, K. Coleman (Romainville, FR; Connecticut, Philadelphia, US) Objective: NXL104 is a novel b-lactamase inhibitor that has been shown in vitro and in vivo to inhibit both class A and class C b-lactamases; it is currently in phase 2 of clinical development in combination with ceftazidime (CAZ Results: Macrodilution MIC values were 0.25 to 2 mg/L for tigecycline, 0.5 to 1 mg/L for colistin and 2 to 16 mg/L for meropenem. In timekill assays, tigecycline and meropenem as single agents were mostly bacteriostatic for the first 6\u22128 hours of incubation with bacterial regrowth to follow, while colistin alone was ineffective. The tigecycline plus colistin combination was in most cases bactericidal after 4 to 8 h of incubation and in some cases also synergistic compared with tigecycline alone, although bacterial regrowth was observed after 8 to 16 h. The tigecycline plus meropenem combination was in most cases also bactericidal after 4 to 6 h of incubation and thereafter regrowth was observed.\n\nThe results of the present study indicate that tigecycline alone could be a therapeutic option for infections due to multidrug resistant KPC producers when bacteriostatic activity is adequate or in combination with colistin or meropenem when bactericidal activity is necessary. Additional in vivo tests may be warranted to fully assess the killing kinetics of tigecycline against KPC producers when the immune system is competent.\n\nEnterobacteriaceae S. Mushtaq, M. Warner, J-C. Zhang, S. Maharjan, M. Doumith, N. Woodford\u00b0, D. Livermore (London, UK) Objectives: Until recently, carbapenems retained near-universal activity against Enterobacteriaceae but resistance is now emerging, mediated either by combinations of ESBL or AmpC enzyme and porin loss or by carbapenemases. The prevalent emerging carbapenemases vary by country: KPC enzymes in the USA and Israel, OXA-48 in Turkey, VIM in southern Europe and NDM in Italy. The UK sees small numbers of isolates with each of these types, some imported, some representing domestic spread. Most are multiresistant. We examined their susceptibility to temocillin a 6-a-methoxy derivative of ticarcillin, notable for stability to ESBLs and AmpC.\n\nMethods: The 81 isolates tested isolates variously had KPC (n = 10), SME-1 (1), IMP (13), VIM (5), NDM (17) or OXA-48 (19 carbapenemases or had combinations of impermeability with an AmpC enzyme or ESBL (16); they included 52 Klebsiella spp., 18 Enterobacter spp., 6 E. coli and 5 others. Transformants and transconjugants were prepared in E. coli DH5-a and J62\u22121, respectively. Carbapenemase genes were identified by PCR and sequencing; MICs were measured by CLSI agar dilution. Results: MICs for isolates with KPC carbapenemases were from 16\u221264 mg/L (geom. mean 40 mg/L) and introduction of a KPC+ plasmid into E. coli only raised the MIC from 8 to 16 mg/L; by contrast MICs for isolates with metallo-b-lactamases were >128 mg/L in 22/36 cases, and introduction of plasmids coding NDN carbapenemase (the commonest MBL in the UK) into E. coli DH5a raised the temocillin MIC from 4 to >64 mg/L. Temocillin MICs for isolates with OXA-48 enzyme were >128 mg/L in 18/19 cases, and the MIC shift on transformation of E. coli DH5-a was from 4 to >128 mg/L. Temocillin MICs for isolates with combinations of porin loss and AmpC or an ESBL were from 8 to 128 mg/L (geom. mean 25 mg/L). Conclusion: If the dosage can be raised from the present 2 g bds, temocillin may be a therapeutic option in some infections due to Enterobacteriaceae with KPC carbapenemases or combination of AmpC or ESBL and porin loss, not against those with OXA-48 or metallocarbapenemases.\n\nP. Lassaux, H. Delbr\u00fcck, M. Gulea, M. Kupper, K. Hoffmann, M. Galleni, C. Bebrone\u00b0(Li\u00e8ge, BE; Aachen, DE; Caen, FR) Objective: Metallo-b-lactamases (MBL) represent an emerging problem due to their capacity to hydrolyze almost all b-lactam antibiotics, including last generation cephalosporins and carbapenems. Due to the presence of two chelating functions (sulfanyl and phosphonato), the mercaptophosphonic acids (phosphorous analogues of mercaptocarboxylic acids) are potential candidates for MBL inhibitors.\n\nThe inhibitory effect of 14 mercapto-phosphonate derivatives against representatives of the three subclasses of MBLs (VIM-4 (B1), CphA (B2) and L1 (B3)) was previously reported [1] . Here, in order to determine the interactions mediating the positioning of the inhibitors in the active site of each enzyme, crystallographic and docking studies were performed with 10a and 18, both inhibitors being active against the three subclasses.\n\nThe crystallographic structure of the CphA-10a and CphA-18 indicated that the sulphur atom of 10a and the phosphonato group of 18 interact with the zinc ion respectively. Molecular modelling on the VIM-4 (B1) and FEZ-1 (B3) enzymes with 10a and 18 also brought to light different binding modes depending on the enzyme and the inhibitor, consistent with the crystallographic structures.\n\nThe investigation of mercapto-phosphonate derivatives as MBL inhibitor has allowed us to find potent inhibitors active on representative members of all the three MBL subclasses. Moreover, on the basis of structural and modelling data, the inhibitory strength of these compounds will be improved further.

Stern (Aarau, Basel, CH) Objectives: Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hematological patients. The emergence of non-Aspergillus molds has been observed in recent years. Hormographiella aspergillata is a Basidiomycete and has previously been implicated in human infections rarely. We describe 3 cases of IFI with H. aspergillata occurring within one year on the hematological ward at the University Hospital Basel. Methods: Patients were hospitalized in single rooms with special highefficiency particle air filters. Surveillance fungal cultures of air filters were carried out regularly. No primary mold prophylaxis was performed. Screening for mold infections was performed by twice weekly measuring serum galactomannan and weekly pulmonary CT scans. Sabouraud agar was inoculated for fungal cultures. The identification of H. aspergillata by culture was molecularly confirmed. Susceptibility testing was performed by Etest. O365 How to improve microbial documentation in febrile neutropenia? Impact of implementing an automat in the ward and addition of DNaemia detection C. Pautas\u00b0, Y. Hicheri, S. Bastuji-Garin, C. Corbel, S. Bretagne, L. Gregoire, E. Sbidian, S. Maury, C. Cordonnier, E. Cambau (Creteil, Paris, FR) Objectives: Febrile neutropenia (FN) is the most frequent complication of high-dose chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Only 30% of FN episodes are microbiologically documented by routine procedures, mainly by blood cultures (BC). We wondered whether shortening the time before incubation could improve this figure. In addition, we searched microbial DNA by the Septifast \u00ae test. Methods: Adult patients were eligible at their 1st FN episode if they were neutropenic (PMN < 0.5\u00d710 9 /L), febrile ( 38\u00ba3 or twice 38\u00ba within 8 h), and had a central venous catheter (CVC). At onset of fever, we collected 4 BC bottles (2 aerobic and 2 anaerobic)sampled through the CVC. They were immediately incubated in the ward (BacT/Alert3D \u00ae ). Septifast was performed on 1.5 ml of blood sampled at the same time. In parallel, 2 standard BCs (1 aerobic and 1 anaerobic bottles) were routinely sampled (1 CVC and 1 peripheral) and sent to the laboratory for incubation. Each patient was assessed for microbial documentation in the blood, either BC positivity or DNA detection; and the time elapsed between blood sampling and documentation, when this latter was positive. Pairwise analyses were performed using the McNemar test for documentation rate and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for times for positivity. Results: 120 consecutive FN episodes were included from Feb 2008 to Mar 2009: 97 (80%) acute leukemia/myelodysplasia, 26 (17%) lymphoid malignancies and 4 (3%) others with 18 (15%) episodes in allogeneic and 16 (13%) in autologous stem cell transplantation. The rate of BC positivity was 30% (36 episodes) in the study process and 28.3% (34 episodes) in the routine process (McNemar's c 2 = 0.67, p = 0.41). In the microbiologically documented episodes, the time elapsed between incubation and positivity was significantly shorter for the BC bottles incubated in the ward (median rank: 12 h25 min [7 h55\u221225 h37]) than for the routine BC bottles (median rank: 13 h03 min [9 h31\u221243 h33]) (p = 0.002). The Septifast test was positive in 9 episodes (7.5%) that were positive also by the BC testing. In 8 additional episodes, the Septifast \u00ae test showed low DNA content out of the threshold, which was nevertheless concordant with positives BCs. Conclusion: Immediate incubation of blood cultures in the ward and detection of DNaemia with the Septifast test did not improve the rate of microbial documentation for FN episodes when compared to BC routine process. However, it reduced the time to positivity.\n\nObjectives: Ophthalmological patients are prone to nosocomial infections due to advanced age and common underlying medical conditions. Eye infections caused by multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens may further contribute to loss of vision in already visually disabled persons. Antimicrobial therapy is often difficult due to unsatisfactory penetration of many agents into the eye. Empiric therapy should be based on data comprising most prevalent pathogens, including MDR pathogens.\n\nMethods: Specimens for bacteriological and fungal culture were obtained from patients hospitalized in ophthalmological hospital (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) Results: Sixty four patients were assessed. The mean age was 58.8 years (from 20 to 85) without differences in distribution by genders. The prevalence of infection was 0.5 cases per 100.000 inhabitants year. Seventy per cent of patients had a chronic underlying disease: cirrhosis of the liver (30%), hematologic neoplasms (25%), chronic debilitating conditions (23%), collagen vascular disease (13%) and solid neoplasms (11%) were the most common underlying conditions. Only 1 pregnant woman was seen. Primary bacteremia (56%) and meningoencephalitis (44%) were the most common presentations. In addition, 10 patients developed focal infecci\u00f3n such as bacterial peritonitis (4), endocarditis (3) and brain abscesses (3). Although most infections were communityacquired, 17 episodes (26%) developed within the hospital after more than 72 h of admission. Nosocomial outbreaks were not detected. Ampicillin (34%) alone or in combination with gentamicin (44%) and cotrimoxazol (16%) were the antimicrobial regimens most frequently used. We did not find differences in the mortality rate among patients on monotherapy (32%) and combined therapy (35%). Cotrimoxazol was successfully used in 9 out of 10 patients treated. Nineteen patients (39%) died within 30-days of diagnosis. Mortality was significantly higher in patients with hematologic or solid neoplasms than in those with cirrhosis or other underlying debilitating disorders (64% vs 36%, p < 0.05). All the patients without comorbidities survived the infection. Conclusions: Human listeriosis is a severe disease still producing high mortality particularly in immunocompromised hosts with hematologic and solid neoplasms and other debilitating conditions. Despite synergistic in vitro activity, the combination of ampicillin plus gentamicin did not determined survival benefits. Cotrimoxazol may be a useful alternative for the antimicrobial therapy of human listeriosis. Taiwan , and cellulitis (4.1%). The mean Pitts bacteremic score was 1.58 (range from score 0 to score 9). There were 6 patients' systolic blood pressure were below 90 mmHg(25%). And consciousness change were noted in 8 patients (33.33%). Leucocytosis were noted in 12 patients(50%), and the mean value of white blood cell counts were 11,065.5/ul (Range was from 4,050/ul to 21,340/ul). And the mean value of c-reactive protein was 6.56 mg/dl. Third generation antibiotics was the most commonly used empirical treatment regimen (50%) and Amoxicillin/clavunalic acid was 20.83%. The mean hospitalization stay was 12.96 days. All cause mortality at 14 days was 4.16% (N = 1) and 16.67% (N = 4) at 30 days.\n\nCampylobacter coli is the leading species causing invasive Campylobacteriosis in immunocompromised patients in Taiwan.\n\nO369 Antifungal drugs improve survival by immunomodulation rather than by reduction of fungal burden in experimental cerebral aspergillosis survival time of animals treated with L-AmB alone (4.3\u00b13.1d) was not different from untreated controls. 2. Fungal culture: The cerebral fungal burden declined over time in all animals including untreated ones. Interestingly, there was no significant difference between controls and treated animals. 3. GM: GM peaked later than the CFU counts in all treatment groups except L-AmB. There were no significant differences in GM indices regarding treatment and time. 4. Cytokines: At 2d after infection both IFN-g and TNF-a [Fig. B ] levels were significantly higher in animals treated with L-AmB alone (135.8\u00b193.9pg/mg and 25.8\u00b122.2pg/mg) compared to CAS (24.1\u00b120.8pg/mg and 6.3\u00b18.4pg/mg; p < 0.001), and VCZ (13.8\u00b18.0pg/mg and 2.0\u00b11.9pg/mg; p < 0.001). No differences were found for IL-1a and IL-10. IL-6 was undetectable in most animals but elevated in severe disease. Conclusion: In this lethal model of cerebral aspergillosis mortality is not determined by the antifungal drug's effect on cerebral fungal burden but by its modulation of the host's immune response. Treatment groups consisted of 10 mice. The test groups were treated with clavulanate (100 mg/kg) alone, imipenem (100 mg/kg) and meropenem (100 mg/kg) alone or combined with clavulanate whereas a positive control group was treated with isoniazid (25 mg/kg) and a negative control group was held without treatment. At the end of treatment, surviving mice were sacrificed and lungs harvested. Treatment efficacy was assessed on survival rate, spleen weights and lung CFU counts. Results: at the end of the 4 weeks, the mortality rates were the following: untreated 60%, isoniazid 0%, clavulanate 30%, imipenem 10%, meropenem 30%, imipenem+clavulanate 0%, meropenem+clavulanate 0%. The combination of imipenem or meropenem plus clavulanate significantly improved survival (p = 0.01 vs untreated mice). On the other hand, imipenem and meropenem combined with clavulanate did not prevent splenomegaly (591 and 573 mg) whereas isoniazid did (304 mg) (p > 0.05). Among groups of mice with 100% survival, only isoniazid reduced lung CFU counts (\u22121.2 log 10 CFU vs D0), the penem+clavulanate combinations did not prevent bacterial growth (+0.9 to 1.4 log 10 CFU vs D0). Conclusion: although less active than isoniazid, the combinations of imipenem or meropenem and clavulanate improve survival of mice infected with M. tuberculosis and should be further evaluated.\n\nD. Croisier-Bertin\u00b0, C. Badiou, S. Rousseau, D. Hayez, S. Mahy, G. Lina, F. Vandenesch, J. Etienne, P. Bret, P. Chavanet (Dijon, Lyon, Paris, FR) Objectives: Many strains of S. aureus harbour the Panton Valentine Leukotoxin (PVL) phage and can cause severe necrotising pneumonia in young immunocompetent patients. In vitro studies showed that some antistaphylococcal drugs can induce or inhibit the PVL production. Animal models are needed to evaluate new treatment strategies in such infections. We compared the efficacy of 4 antibiotic human therapies in a severe model of PVL necrotizing pneumonia in rabbits. Methods: 2 isogenic and fully-susceptible S. aureus strains were used to induce pneumonia: RN6390 PVL\u2212 and LUG855 PVL+. Animals were randomized to no treatment (controls) or to a 48 h IV human equivalent dosage of either vancomycin (VA continuous perfusion Css=30 mg/l), cloxacillin (CLOX 2g/6 h), clindamycin (CLI 600 mg/8 h) or linezolid (LZO, 600 mg/12 h). Serum levels were measured by microbiological assay or HPLC, pharmacokinetic data were obtained, and evaluation of efficacy was based on bacterial counts in lungs (mean\u00b1SD) and the residual quantity of PVL (mg/residual CFU).\n\nResults: Several inocula were tested to perfect this model. Here are the results for an inoculum of 8.5 log CFU/mL (table) . Controls: The mortality rate (60\u221266%) and bacterial content in controls were the same between PVL\u2212 and PVL+ groups. -407) . The colonising ability was tested by colonisation of the large intestine of streptomycin treated mice. Different colonisation, competition and inoculation procedures were tested in this model. Results: Both IBD strains had increased growth rate compared to the E. coli from the healthy person and the E. coli Nissle strain. Likewise, the IBD strains had an increased adhesion capacity in the cell adhesion assay. In the animal model all strains were able to colonise the gastrointestinal tract in high levels when inoculated alone. In competition with the probiotic Nissle strain both IBD strains co-colonised, though to a log higher (in CFU/g faeces) than Nissle, when inoculated in equal high levels. When E. coli Nissle was inoculated in high levels compared to IBD strain in low levels the strains also co-colonised at the end of the experiment. The E. coli strain from the healthy person also co-colonised with E. coli Nissle in intestine of the mice, but stabilised at a log lower than Nissle strain, when inoculated in equal high levels and two logs lower when inoculated at a lower level than E. coli Nissle. Conclusion: IBD strains had increased growth rates and adhesion abilities compared to E. coli isolated from a healthy person and E. coli Nissle. Furthermore, E. coli from IBD patients had an increased ability to co-colonise with the probiotic E. coli Nissle strain.\n\nO374 MUT056399, a new drug candidate against S. aureus: PK parameters and safety S. Escaich\u00b0, C. Soulama, F. Moreau, V. Gerusz, L. Durant (Paris, Romainville, FR) Background: MUT056399 is a novel antistaphylococcal agent targeting the essential enzyme FabI. We present here its key properties: in vivo efficacy, preclinical pharmacokinetics and safety, finally the pharmacology data of phase I. Methods: Standard procedures were used for evaluation of PK parameters. Preclinical safety sudies were conducted on mice, rat and dogs in GLP conditions. In vivo assays were performed using the mice models of septicaemia and thigh infection using methicillin-susceptible and non susceptible S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA). Linezolid and vancomycin were used as comparators.\n\nIn Phase I, ascending doses of MUT056399 formulated in HPBCD were administrated to healthy volunteers by iv infusions. Results: PK studies in 3 species indicated that MUT056399 given iv was rapidly cleared from the blood (T1/2 =3\u22125 h). The MUT056399 molecule was well distributed among tissues without accumulation.\n\nIn the thigh infection model with MRSA strains, after a single sc administration the mean static dose was 143 mg/kg/d in neutropenic mice and 45 mg/kg/d in immunocompetent mice.\n\nIn the mouse septicaemia model using a single sc administration of MUT056399, the mean ED50 against MSSA ATCC 29213, was 21.6 mg/kg/day, against MRSA strains the mean ED50 was 31 mg/kg/day and 49.6 mg/kg/day for a GISA strain.\n\nIn GLP safety studies in rats and dogs MUT56 399 did not affect CV, CNS or respiratory functions. In Phase I, the administration of a single intra venous doses from 10 mg/d to 1.2 mg /d was safe. Conclusion: MUT056399 is a novel highly potent antistaphylococcal agent with a clean safety profile. These properties support MUT056399 as a very promising candidate for a novel drug to treat severe staphylococcal infections. Objectives: BAL30072 is a novel siderophore monocyclic b-lactam belonging to the sulfactams. We evaluated the in vitro antimicrobial activity of this compound against a panel of Escherichia coli clinical isolates and studied its efficacy against peritonitis and sepsis in mice caused by an ESBL-producing strain of E. coli.\n\nThe antimicrobial activity of BAL30072 was tested against 39 strains (20 wild type and 19 ESBL-producers). MICs were determined using agar dilution on Mueller-Hinton agar supplemented with 2, 2' bipyridyl to induce iron transport. In vivo efficacy was evaluated against a CTX-M-15-like-producing E. coli strain using a lethal peritonitis sepsis model in neutropenic ICR mice. Survival was monitored for seven days after infection. E. coli inocula ranged from 2.5\u00d710 6 to 5.0\u00d710 6 cfu/mouse (2\u22125 X LD50) and BAL30072 was administered intraperitoneally 3 times daily for 3 days (doses of 100 mg/kg down to 12.5 mg/kg) following infection. Saline was administered to the untreated control group and meropenem was administered to the treated control group. Results: MIC50/MIC90 of BAL30072 for wild type, and ESBLproducing E. coli were 0.125/0.5, and <0.0625/1 mg/L, respectively (ranges <0.0625\u22121 and <0.0625-256 mg/L, respectively). The MIC of BAL30072 against the ESBL-E. coli used in the mouse model was <0.0625 mg/L. In vivo experiments in mice infected intraperitoneally with various E. coli inocula showed that, at doses from 100 mg/kg down to 12.5 mg/kg, BAL30072 conferred protection similar to meropenem (90-100% survival). Survival in the placebo group was 0\u221233%. Conclusion: BAL30072 is an effective antibacterial agent against clinical isolates of E. coli, including ESBL-producing strains. It is highly effective treatment against infection caused by ESBL-producing E. coli as demonstrated in mice peritonitis-sepsis model. Objectives: ACHN-490 is a novel sisomicin derivative stable to nearly all aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. We compared its activity with that of other aminoglycosides vs. clinical Enterobacteriaceae representing the diversity of carbapenem resistance types now emerging in the UK. Most were multiresistant. Methods: The 81 isolates comprised those with the Class A carbapenemases KPC (n = 10) or SME-1 (1); Class B enzymes, IMP (13), VIM (5) and NDM (17) and the Class D enzyme, or with combinations of impermeability plus an AmpC or ESBL (16). They included 52 Klebsiella spp., 18 Enterobacter spp., 6 E. coli and 5 others. Carbapenemase genes were identified by PCR and sequencing as were those encoding the 16S rRNA methylases ArmA and RmtA-C. MICs were measured by CLSI agar dilution.\n\nResults: ACHN-490 was active against all 64 non-NDM+ isolates at <2 mg/L, with 95% of MICs between 0.06 and 0.5 mg/L. Isepamicin was active at 8 mg/L against 62 of these 64 whereas 35%, 61% and 19% were resistant to gentamicin at 4 mg/L, tobramycin at 4 mg/L and amikacin at 16 mg/L, respectively. Among the 17 isolates with the NDM-1 enzyme \u2212 many from patients with prior medical contact on the Indian subcontinent \u2212 16 harboured armA or rmtC and were resistant to ACHN-490 and to all other human-use aminoglycosides at >32 mg/L; armA and rmtC were absent from the sole ACHN-490susceptible NDM-1-positive strain. Apramycin, a veterinary analogue, was active at 4\u22128 mg/L against (i) control strains, (ii) the NDM-1positive isolates with armA or rmtC and (iii) all other strains except a Serratia with SME-1 enzyme (MIC > 128 mg/L). Conclusion: ACHN-490 had potent activity vs. all the carbapenemresistant isolates screened except those with combinations of NDM-1 enzyme and ArmA or RmtC rRNA methylases; the international prevalence of these enzymes needs urgent surveillance. Evasion of ArmA and RmtC by apramycin is striking and may facilitate future human drug development.\n\nObjectives: The ever increasing resistance of pathogenic bacteria towards the current arsenal of antimicrobial therapeutics emphasizes the urgent requirement for development of novel agents. It is currently estimated over 80% of clinical infections are also biofilm associated, therefore, agents that are effective against multiply resistant, biofilm forming would be extremely advantageous. The aim of the current study was to assess the effect of novel antimicrobial agent (NI02) against a range of pathogenic bacteria and against a clinical isolate Staphylococcus epidermidis that displays methicillin resistance and a biofilm phenotype. Methods: The deferred antagonism method was used to assess the range of activity of NI02 against a selection of pathogenic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The traditional biofilm forming assay was also employed using preparations of NI02 with an inhibitory activity of >2560 AU/ml to coat microtitre wells and also to treat mature (48 hour) biofilms.\n\nThe deferred antagonism assay showed NI02 to have good activity against a range of Gram-positive pathogens including vancomycin resistant enterococci, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria sp., Bacillus subtillis and Bacillus cereus and Gram-negative isolate Moraxella catarrhalis. NI02 also showed good activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms as coating microtitre plate wells resulted in complete inhibition of biofilm development and treatment of mature biofilms resulted in a significant reduction in biofilm density (P 0.001).\n\nThe results obtained in the current study demonstrate the broad-spectrum activity of antimicrobial agent NI02 against a range of pathogenic bacteria and the ability of the inhibitor to prevent and disrupt biofilms.\n\nGram-negative bacteria producing acquired metallo-b-lactamases (MBLs) represent one of the greatest challenges for modern antimicrobial therapy. MBL producers commonly exhibit resistance not only to a broad-spectrum of b-lactams but also to a variety of non-b-lactam agents owing to association of MBL genes with those affecting different groups of antibiotics. The IMP and VIM enzymes are the most common acquired MBLs. These enzymes were first reported in Japan and Europe but are now broadly disseminated in many countries of all populated continents. Production of acquired MBLs is most often observed in P. aeruginosa, with VIM-2 being the most ubiquitous enzyme, and less frequently in Acinetobacter spp. and in Enterobacteriaceae, mainly in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae, with VIM-1 or VIM-4 being the most typical variants in the latter species. MBLs of other genetic groups were either identified in isolates causing sporadic infections and local outbreaks (e.g. GIM-1, SIM-1, KHM-1, AIM-1) or as endemic types in some geographic areas (e.g. SPM-1 in Latin America). However, the recent reports of the international importation of SPM-1 from Brazil to Switzerland and of NDM-1 from India to the UK provide continuing evidence of the increasing complexity of MBL epidemiology. The prevalence of MBL-producers varies significantly among different countries and their epidemiology now ranges from sporadic monoclonal outbreaks to polyclonal endemicity. Furthermore, MBL-producing strains are no longer confined to nosocomial environment but are being identified also in residents of long-term-care facilities and even in patients with community-acquired infections. The association of MBL genes with mobile genetic platforms (e.g. Tn402-like transposons in the case of blaVIM genes), broad host range plasmids and highly epidemic clones (e.g. P. aeruginosa clonal complexes CC235 and CC111) were apparently implicated in the rapid spread of these important resistance determinants.\n\nClass D b-lactamase-mediated resistance to b-lactams has been increasingly reported during the last decade. Those enzymes also known as oxacillinases or OXAs are widely distributed among Gram negatives. They do usually possess a narrow spectrum b-lactam hydrolysis profile, but some of them do possess the ability to hydrolyse carbapenems, even at a low level. They have been named Carbapenem-Hydrolysing class D b-Lactamases, or CHDLs. CHDLs are known to be intrinsic in some Gram negative rods, including Acinetobacter baumannii (OXA-51-like enzymes) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (OXA-50-like enzymes), but usually play a minor role in the natural resistance phenotypes. Besides those naturally-occurring CHDLs, others have been identified as acquired. They have been mostly identified in Acinetobacter spp. (mostly in A. baumannii), and belong to four distinct groups according to their amino acid sequences, namely the OXA-23, OXA-40, OXA-58, and OXA-143 groups. The genes encoding those CHDLs in A. baumannii are either plasmid-or chromosome-encoded. Interestingly, the blaOXA-23 progenitor was shown to be Acinetobacter radioresistens, a nonpathogenic and environmental species. Despite their weak ability to hydrolyse carbapenems, those CHDLs are responsible for high level resistance to those compounds when their expression is associated with other mechanisms such as efflux overepression, penicillin-binding protein modifications, or porin loss. Another CHDL, OXA-48, distantly related from those CHDLs identified in A. baumannii, has been identified in several enterobacterial species, and mostly in Klebsiella pneumoniae. The blaOXA-48 gene which has been found to originate from Shewanella spp. is plasmid-mediated, increasingly reported in different countries, and responsible for resistance to carbapenems when associated with permeability deffects. Acquired CHDL encoding genes have been mostly identified in association with insertion sequences that are either responsible for their expression and their acquisition. In particular, both the blaOXA-48 and blaOXA-23 genes have been identified inside composite integron structures (IS1999-and ISAba1-made, respectively).\n\nCarbapenems (excluding ertapenem) are treatments of choice for infections caused by multi-resistant A. baumannii so the emergence of carbapenem resistance is a serious problem. As with other Gram-negative species, carbapenem resistance has been attributed to multiple mechanisms, including reduced permeability through loss of outer membrane proteins, altered penicillin-binding proteins and overexpression of weakly carbapenem-hydrolyzing b-lactamases, but the major mechanism is carbapenemase production. Diverse carbapenemases have been reported in A. baumannii, differing in their regional prevalence: isolates with IMP or VIM metallo-enzymes are globally scattered; those with SIM-1 are associated particularly with the Far East, while NDM-1 has been observed only rarely. OXA class D enzymes are the dominant carbapenemases in A. baumannii, with 5 phylogenetically distinct groups identified. OXA-51-like enzymes are intrinsic to the species, and are only associated with carbapenem resistance when up-regulated by an adjacent insertion sequence, usually ISAba1. By contrast, OXA-23-like, OXA-40-like, OXA-58-like and OXA-143 carbapenemases have all been acquired via horizontal gene spread. These enzymes usually confer clinically significant carbapenem resistance, although the MICs for individual isolates are influenced by the particular gene present, its copy number, and presence of accessory mechanisms (e.g. loss of the CarO porin). The blaOXA genes may be located on the chromosome, as part of large resistance islands, or on plasmids. Local outbreaks of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii typically include a predominant strain, and strains from epidemiologically unlinked sites may show sufficient similarity to be regarded as the same clone. There are two dominant carbapenemresistant clones in the UK, 'OXA-23 clone 1' has OXA-23 enzyme, and the 'South-east clone' has ISAba1-up-regulated OXA-83 enzyme; both have affected >50 hospitals and belong to sequence group 1 (based on ompA, csuE and blaOXA-51-like alleles), which is European clone II. In other countries there may be greater evidence for horizontal gene spread in addition to strain spread, as observed for OXA-72 (an OXA-40-like enzyme) in a Taiwanese hospital. There are few therapeutic options for infections caused by carbapenem-resistant strains other than a polymyxin or glycylcycline and effective infection control remains essential to control their spread and impact.\n\nHost-pathogen interactions determine the outcomes M. tuberculosis infection by influencing key control points in the natural history of infection, including progression from latent infection to active disease and the clinical spectrum of active disease itself. Our understanding of the natural history and epidemiology of tuberculosis infection are based on two key century-old tools, the tuberculin skin test and chest radiography. The advent of new, more accurate markers of infection presents an opportunity to re-evaluate our conventional understanding of the host-pathogen relationship in tuberculosis, including the natural history and epidemiology of tuberculosis infection. The application of interferon-gamma release assays in epidemiologically well-defined tuberculosis outbreaks and longitudinal cohorts points towards a new class of host-pathogen interaction in a subset of tuberculosis contacts that likely involves a transient, self-resolving infection. This entity was not previously appreciated and has significant implications for our understanding of the host-pathogen interaction in tuberculosis infection which will be discussed. T cell-based testing for tuberculosis infection has also uncovered a role for BCG vaccine in preventing infection despite M. tuberculosis exposure. The implications of this phenomenon for the design and evaluation of new tuberculosis vaccines, as well from tuberculosis control, will be discussed. Newer biomarkers, measuring multiple facets of the host response to tuberculosis infection and disease, have recently been developed and may enable discrimination between the several stages in the natural history of tuberculosis infection, eg differentiating between active and latent tuberculosis infection. These new types of biomarkers will be reviewed as well as the the new insights they could provide for our understanding of the host-pathogen equilibrium in tuberculosis infection.\n\nNew medicines for tuberculosis (NM4TB): Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the oldest infectious diseases known to man and has infected one third of the world's population. As a result, someone dies from the disease every 15 seconds and over 20 million more people will lose their lives to TB in the next decade. Although directly observed short course chemotherapy (DOTS) is available to treat the disease, this treatment is old, slow and inefficient by the current standards of the pharmaceutical industry. Furthermore, the efficacy of the DOTS programme has been severely compromised in certain regions by the emergence of multidrug-and extensively drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This new menace is of particular concern to Europe and the countries of the former Soviet Union.\n\nIn an integrated approach to discover new TB drugs, we have been pursuing a new class of antimycobacterial compounds known as the benzothiazinones (1,3-benzothiazin-4-ones, BTZs). The BTZ kill M. tuberculosis in vitro, ex vivo, and in mouse models of TB and are exceptionally potent. Using genetics and biochemistry, we identified the enzyme decaprenylphosphoryl-b-D-ribose 2'-epimerase as a major BTZ target. The inhibition of this critical enzyme activity abolishes the formation of decaprenylphosphoryl arabinose, a key precursor that is required for the synthesis of the cell-wall arabinans, thereby provoking cell lysis and bacterial death. The most advanced compound, BTZ043, which is currently in the late preclinical stage, is a candidate for inclusion in combination therapies for both drug-sensitive and extensively drugresistant TB.\n\nS389 From case reports to causality: how can we quantify rare adverse events, how should they be considered in the treatment decisions?\n\nRare adverse events after drugs, vaccines, and other therapeutic agents are usually identified after the product is licensed and in widespread use. Historically, surveillance for these has relied on case reports. While case reports have identified many important problems, they have drawbacks, including unknown sensitivity for detecting events of interest and inability to provide the quantitative estimates of risk that are needed to make informed decisions about the balance of benefits and risk. Quantitative information about risks and also about benefits is becoming increasingly available through the secondary use of electronic health data \u2212 both electronic medical records and administrative data \u2212 collected during the routine delivery of health care. Among the earliest examples is the U.S. Centers for Disease Control's Vaccine Safety Datalink, which performs both active, near real-time, surveillance for vaccine-associated adverse events, and retrospective epidemiological studies. These methods are being modified to work in groups of health plans with tens of millions of members, and to address the sequelae of exposures to drugs as well as vaccines. An important feature of these methods is that they require minimal sharing of confidential personal information, because there is no need to create large pooled datasets in order to identify signals of adverse events. The presentation will illustrate these issues using the current experience evaluating the safety of the H1N1 influenza vaccine and others. It will also address the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's plan to create a Sentinel Network, which will use information from electronic medical records covering 100 million people to perform routine safety evaluation of marketed medical products. Additional considerations regarding assessment of benefit will be addressed.\n\nMRSA bacteremia and endocarditis represent some of the most challenging and difficult infections to overcome with antibiotics. Understanding the relationships between antibiotic pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, target organism, site of infection and the potential for resistance development is key for successful patient outcome.\n\nOptimizing therapy exploits the specific antibiotic pharmacodynamic parameter that best predicts in vivo efficacy. For example, in the case of b-lactams, improving the time above the MIC for the targeted pathogen may be accomplished by prolonging the infusion time or utilizing continuous infusion administration. For aminoglycosides, use of high-dose once-daily therapy should increase the Cmax/MIC. Recently, based on the need to improve the performance of vancomycin, higher troughs have been recommended. Higher troughs are needed in order to achieve a higher AUC/MIC ratio which is thought to be important for serious infections like complicated bacteremia, infective endocarditis and pneumonia. Additional factors that affect antibiotic performance include the ability to reach the site of infection (barriers to penetration) and conditions at the site of infection such as pH, protein binding and inoculum. This lecture will discuss specific antibiotic PK/PD characteristics, conditions at the site of infection that diminish antibiotic activity and opportunity to improve performance. F. Huenger\u00b0, A. Agyekum, B. Nkrumah, S. Ekuban, N. Sarpong, N.G. Schwarz, H. Sch\u00fctt-Gerowitt, J. May, Y. Adu-Sarkodie (Dortmund, DE; Kumasi, GH; Hamburg, Cologne, DE) Objective: To evaluate the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in Enterobacteriaceae isolated from blood cultures of children in rural Ghana. Methods: Between October 2007 and June 2009 blood cultures were collected from children admitted to the Agogo Presbytarian Hospital located in the rural area of the Ashanti \u2212 Akim North District with a population of about 135,000. Peds Plus\u2122 bottles and the BacTec\u2122 9050 system were used and detected strains were identified by Gram staining, selective subcultures, biochemical testing and specific agglutination tests. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of isolated Enterobacteriaceae and production of extended-spectrum-b-lactamases (ESBL) was determined by the Etest\u2122 method. Results: In this study isolated Enterobacteriaceae (n = 178) were nontyphoid Salmonella enterica (NTS) (113), Salmonella Typhi (39), Escherichia coli (15) Klebsiella sp. (9), Shigella boydii (1) and Enterobacter sp. (1) . NTS were highly resistant to ampicillin (80.5%), cotrimoxazole (82.3%), chloramphenicol (83.2%), and tetracycline (10.6%). No strain was resistant to ciprofloxacin, but one strain had reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone. The majority of S. Typhi strains were also resistant to ampicillin (69.2%), cotrimoxazole (60.0%), chloramphenicol (66.7%), and tetracycline (60.0%), but all were completely susceptible to ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone. All E. coli isolates were resistant to ampicillin and 20% produced ESBL. Resistance to cotrimoxacole (93.3%), tetracycline (86.7%), chloramphenicol (53.3%) and ciprofloxacin (26.7%) was frequently detected. All Klebsiella strains were resistant to ampicillin and tetracycline and 77.8% produced ESBL. Only one strain was susceptible to cotrimoxazole, 77.8% were resistant to chloramphenicol and one third to ciprofloxacin. The Enterobacter strain procuced ESBL and was only susceptible to ciprofloxacin. The Shigella boydii isolate was susceptible to ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin. Conclusion: The study indicates that the majority of Enterobacteriaceae causing bacteraemia in children in the study area are resistant to the majority of local available antibiotics. Moreover this massive emergence of multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and ESBL producing E. coli and Klebsiella strains in clinical isolates indicates a serious medical and economic burden for African healthcare systems. Surveillance programs and prevention strategies have to be established to face this challenge.\n\ndissemination in Escherichia coli within families L. L\u00f3pez-Cerero\u00b0, P. Egea, M. Navarro, L. Serrano, J. Rodr\u00edguez-Ba\u00f1o, A. Pascual (Seville, ES) Objectives: The means of transmission of ESBL-producing E. coli (ESBLEC) isolates in the community are poorly understood. We previously reported that the prevalence of faecal carriage with ESBLEC was higher in relatives of patients with urinary tract infections (UTI) caused by these organisms.in 54 households The aim of this study was to analyse the molecular relationship of the ESBLEC within families settings and the plasmids identified. Methods: We studied 72 ESBL-producing E. coli isolates (34 CTX-M-14, 31 SHV-12, 3 CTX-M-9, 3 CTX-M-15 and 1 CTX-M-32) from 19 families of patients with UTI caused by ESBLEC where at least other faecal carrier within the family was identified (19 patients with UTI and 23 relatives). All isolates were evaluated by XbaI PFGE; the molecular the relatedness was determined by the UPG method using the Dice similarity index on Fingerprinting 3.0. Phylogenetic groups were assigned by multiplex PCR. Transfers of bla genes were carried out by conjugations experiments and transformation by electroporation into J53 and DH10 E. coli, respectively. Plasmids were compared by size using S1 nuclease digestion and by the patterns resulted of southern hybridation of HindIII-digested plasmid DNAs from transformants or transconjugants. Results: A total of 44 different PFGE patterns were identified distributed among phylogenetic groups A (23%), B1 (34%), D (32%) and B2 (11%). Nine relatives (39%) from 7 families (37%) carried the same pulsotype and ESBL than the patient with UTI in their family. In 10 families (53%), the isolates from different members yielded different pulsotypes harbouring the same enzyme; among them, the ESBL was located in similar RFLP plasmidic patterns in 5 families (3 with CTX-M14 and 2 with SHV-12). The CTX-M14 bla gene hybridazed with a single 20 kb hybridation band in 9 plasmids, whereas SHV-12 bla gene was located in fragments with different sizes in 13 plasmids. Conclusions: Common source or horizontal transmission of the same ESBL-producing strain or plasmid was found in 63% of the families with ESBL-producers carriers. The acquisition of different clones producing different ESBL enzymes by members of the same household was less frequent in our study, but denote other routes of spread in the community. Results: Of 262 enrolled persons, 231 submitted faecal samples and questionnaires before and after travel and were included for analysis. Before and after travel, 9 (4%) and 73 (32%) persons were colonised by ESBL-PE, respectively. No KPC were found. E. coli was the most commonly found species. Gender, age, use of oral cholera vaccination or antibiotics and duration of travel were similar among persons acquiring ESBL-PE during travel (travel associated (TA)-carriers, n = 69) and persons never colonised by ESBL-PE (non-carriers, n = 154). TA-carriers more often reported diahorrea (54%) or other abdominal symptoms (25%) during travel, compared to non-carriers (38% and 13%). Business was a more common cause for travelling among TA-carriers (12%) than non-carriers(6%), whereas TA-carriers more often reported travelling as \"backpackers\", 16% vs. 8%. The frequencies of TA-carriers after travel to the most visited countries (>10 travellers/country) were: India 82%, Egypt 57%, Peru 36%, Thailand 37%, South Africa 27% and Tanzania 24%, respectively. Conclusions: Travel increases the risk of faecal colonisation by ESBL-PE. Acquisition of ESBL-PE during travel is associated with abdominal symptoms such as diahorrea. Objectives: Extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) is a worldwide public health problem. Few data are available on ESBL in Egypt. The aim of this study was to compare the fecal carriage of ESBL-producing enterobacteria (ESBL-E) in patients admitted to the hepatology department of 2 hospitals specialized in liver diseases, Theodor. Bilharz Research Institute (TBRI) in Cairo (Egypt) and Beaujon hospital (Bj) in Clichy (France). Methods: All patients admitted during May-June 2009 for more than 24 h in the hepatology department in TBRI and in Bj were screened at admission with a rectal swab for detection of ESBL-E digestive carriage. CTX-M groups were identified by PCR and TEM and SHV derivatives with the check point system. Phylogenetic groups of E. coli were determined by multiplex PCR and clone ST131 by PCR of gene pabB.The following demographic and clinical data were collected: gender, age, previous hospitalizations, underlying diseases and ascites. Results: During the study period, the prevalence of patients with ESBL-E was 77.6% (45/58) in TBRI and 6.5% (13/199) in Bj. A previous hospitalization was more common (p = 0.003) in Bj patients (93%) than in TBRI patients (45%). The 2 populations also differed with regard to the underlying diseases (p = 0.0003). We studied 49 ESBL-E from TBRI and 14 from Bj because 4 and 1 patients, respectively, had 2 ESBL-E. Of the 49 ESBL-E of TBRI, 90%, 8% and 2% were E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and E. cloacae, respectively. Of the 14 ESBL-E from Bj, 72%, 14%, 7% and 7% were E. coli, E. cloacae, K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca, respectively. The species distribution did not differ between the 2 countries. In TBRI, 59%, 29% and 12% of ESBL were enzymes of groups CTX-M-1, CTX-M-9 and SHV, respectively, whereas in Bj, 79%, 14% and 7% were of groups CTX-M-1, TEM and SHV, respectively. No significant difference was observed for enzymes of groups CTX-M-1 and SHV. Of the 44 TBRI E. coli, 59% belonged to phylogenetic group A, 27% to D, 7% to B1 and 7% to B2 whereas of the 10 Bj E. coli, 40% belonged to A, 40% to B1 and 20% to D. ESBL-E of group B1 were significantly higher in Bj than in TBRI (p = 0.04). The 3 TBRI B2 isolates belonged to clone ST131.\n\nThe prevalence of patients with ESBL-E fecal carriage was very high in TBRI. More than 50% of these patients did not have a previous hospitalisation, suggesting a very high prevalence of ESBL-E in t the community in Egypt.\n\nObjectives: Two recent studies identified admission to a room previously occupied by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or a vancomycin-resistant enterococci patient as an independent risk factor for acquisition of these bacteria. The aim of our study was to determine whether admission to an ICU room previously occupied by a multidrugresistant Gram negative bacilli (MDRGNB) carrier increase the risk of acquiring these bacteria by subsequent patients. Methods: Prospective observational cohort study performed in a 30-bed ICU during a 1-year period. All patients hospitalized >48 h were eligible. Patients with MDRGNB at ICU admission were excluded. MDRGNB were defined as MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa (resistant to imipenem or to ceftazidime), Acinetobacter baumannii, and extended spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) producing GNB. All patients were hospitalized in single rooms. The infection control policy included isolation techniques, routine screening of MDR bacteria (MDRGNB and MRSA), written antibiotic treatment protocol, and continuous surveillance of nosocomial infections. Isolation techniques were used for all patients at ICU admission, until receipt of screening results. In addition, these techniques were used for patients with MDR bacteria, and for all immunosuppressed patients. Routine screening of MDR bacteria (nasal, and anal swabs; and tracheal aspirate in intubated patients) was performed for all patients at ICU admission and weekly thereafter. Conclusion: Admission to an ICU room previously occupied by a MDR P. aeruginosa or an A. baumannii carrier is an independent risk factor for acquisition of these microorganisms by subsequent room occupants.\n\nObjectives: In a recent study (NEJM 2009; 360:20) selective digestive decontamination (SDD) was, compared to Selective Oropharyngeal Decontamination (SOD), associated with a significant reduction in ICUacquired bacteremia caused by Gram-negative bacteria (GNB). The difference between SDD and SOD is intestinal tract decontamination and standard 4 days of cefotaxim during SDD (and not during SOD). We hypothesized that intestinal colonization with GNB was associated with subsequent ICU-acquired GNB bacteremia in patients receiving SDD.\n\nMethods: Retrospective cohort study in a tertiary care ICU in the Netherlands, including all patients that had received SDD between Sept 2008 and Sept 2009. Rectal carriage with GNB was determined twice weekly during ICU-stay. For each patient-day the status of intestinal GNB colonization was determined, creating patient-days with and without intestinal GNB colonization. Incidence densities of ICU-acquired GNB bacteremia were calculated for 1,000 patient-days with and without intestinal GNB colonization. Results: 730 patients (7762 patients-days at risk) were included and 650 (89%) had >1 episode of rectal GNB colonization during ICU-stay. 23 patients (3.2%) had >1 episode of ICU-acquired GNB bacteremia. Incidences of ICU-acquired GNB bacteremia were 6.1 and 1.9 per 1,000 patient days for the periods with and without intestinal GNB colonization [relative risk 3.78 (95% CI 1.66-8.61)]. The median onset of ICU-acquired bacteremia with and without intestinal GNB was 12 (IQR 37.5) and 8.5 (IQR 14.3) respectively (p = 0.4); 3 and 2 ICUacquired bacteremias occurred within the first 4 days after ICUadmission. 10 (43%) Episodes of bacteremia were preceded by rectal colonization with the same species, being most frequently Serratia spp (n = 3) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3). 3 patients had already lost rectal carriage at the time of bacteremia with the same species. Conclusion: Intestinal colonization with GNB during SDD is associated with an almost 4-fold risk of developing GNB bacteremia. 78% of ICUacquired bacteremia occurred after day 4, indicating that this association seems not to be influenced by cefotaxime use.\n\nI.H. L\u00f6hr\u00b0, S. Rettedal, K. \u00d8ymar, A. Sundsfjord, O. Nat\u00e5s (Stavanger, Troms\u00f8, NO) Objective: Molecular characterization of a multiresistant extendedspectrum blactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae-strain associated with an outbreak in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at Stavanger University Hospital, Norway. Evaluate long term colonization in affected newborns and transmission to family members. Methods: Rectal/fecal samples were cultured on modified MacConkey agar and on chrom ID ESBL-plates (bioM\u00e9rieux). Susceptibility testing was performed by disk diffusion and Etest. ESBL-production was confirmed by double disk approximation test. blactamase-genes were detected by PCR and typed by DNA sequencing. Clonal relatedness was examined by PFGE. A follow-up study has been initiated. Monthly rectal/fecal samples are collected from the newborns and their families.\n\nThe outbreak was disclosed Jan 30th 2009 after identification of multiresistant K. pneumoniae in clinical samples from three patients. Subseqently, 58 children were found to be colonized with ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae after screening all patients in the NICU (26/27 colonized) and children discharged from the NICU or maternity ward during Nov 2008 to Jan 2009 (28/500 colonized). After cohorting and strengthened infection control measures another four children (4/89) at the NICU were colonized during Feb to April.\n\nOnly one patient had a severe clinical infection (septicaemia) and recovered successfully after treatment with meropenem. All isolates (n = 58) expressed resistance to aztreonam, 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins, clavulanic acid synergy as well as co-resistance to aminoglycocides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and nitrofurantoin. CTX-M-type (group1) was confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing. All isolates examined (n = 17) displayed an indistinguishable Xba1-PFGEpattern. 49 colonized children and 80 family members were included in the follow-up study. After nine months of follow-up, 45 children (92%) are still colonized. Transmission to 16 family members (20%) has been detected.\n\nConclusions: This is the first major hospital outbreak caused by ESBLproducing Enterobacteriaceae in Norway. The outbreak onset was about two months before the ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae-strain was identified. A subclinical outbreak like this is difficult to detect unless patients are regularly screened. Long time carriage in newborns is a possible reservoar for the spread of ESBL-producing bacteria in hospitals and in the community.\n\nObjectives: Infection control practices on extended spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) include barrier precautions and flagging of carriers. The Dutch guidelines on infection control of ESBLs recommend to perform twice-weekly surveillance cultures and to end the precautions if 2 consecutive cultures are negative. The cost-effectiveness of these cultures is dependent on the proportion of pts that remain positive. These data are, however not available. In addition, carriers should be flagged. However, there are little data on the duration of ESBL colonization and therefore recommendations for the duration of flagging are lacking. The aim of this study was 1) to determine the duration of ESBL colonization, both hospital and community acquired and 2) to determine the proportion of pts that remain positive during hospitalisation.\n\nIn the 2008 database of the national antimicrobial resistance surveillance system (ISIS-AR) each pt with a positive culture with either Escherichia coli (EC) or Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) (intermediate) resistant (I/R) to third generation cephalosporines (CEPH) and at least one follow up culture with an EC or KP were identified. For each pt the time period was determined between the first ESBL positive and first negative culture. The primary end point was July 31st, 2009. The duration of colonisation was estimated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, in which all pts without a last negative culture were censored. Figure. Days to 3rd gen. cephalosporin susceptible isolate.\n\nIn 2008, 1139 pts had a positive culture with an isolate I/R to CEPH (ESBL confirmation test positive in 81% of pts). 926 pts had an ESBL positive follow-up culture. The median colonisation time was 192 days (95% CI 172-216), the first quartile 56 days (95% CI 41\u221269) and the third quartile 365 days (95% CI 334-391) (Figure) . For 575 pts the first positive isolate was cultured during admission. Of the 470 with a follow up culture the proportion of pts with a positive isolate after week 1 was 63% and after week 2 58%. Conclusions: At least 75% of pts remain ESBL positive for at least 2 months and 25% of the pts is still carrier after one year. This implicates that flagging should be continued until screening cultures at (re-) admission are shown to be negative. At least 60% of the patients remain ESBL positive during hospitalisation.\n\nSince the real percentage is likely higher due to interference of antimicrobial therapy with culture results, the advice to perform 2-weekly surveillance cultures should be reconsidered. In a point-prevalence study in post-acute-care facilities (PACFs), we previously identified type of ward, prolonged length of stay (LOS) and infection control policies as ecological factors associated with CRKP colonization. It is important to distinguish between ecological and individual-level risk factors in order to direct interventions appropriately. Here we extended our analysis to assess individual risk factors for colonization among residents without history of CRKP carriage. Methods: A point-prevalence study was conducted in 12 PACFs. Rectal swabs were obtained from residents without a history of CRKP carriage in 33 wards. Suspicious colonies growing on CHROMagar\u2122 KPC plates were speciated and tested for carbapenem susceptibilities by VITEK \u00ae 2, supplemented by Etest \u00ae . We used a nested, matched case-control study design to assess individual risk factors for colonization. Cases were defined as patients with positive rectal screening. Controls were selected from patients with negative rectal screening, matched to cases by ward. Patient data collected from medical records included demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, presence of skin lesions, presence of invasive devices, antibiotic exposure, number of colonized roommates, and PACF LOS. Results: Of 1004 residents without history of CRKP, colonization was detected in 119 (12%). Covariates entered into the matched multivariable model included: Norton score, antibiotic exposure during the past 3 months, skin lesions, receipt of amoxicillin-clavulanate during the past month and colonization with other resistant pathogens. Independent risk factors for CRKP colonization were: antibiotic exposure during the past 3 months (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.03\u22122.6, p = 0.04) and colonization with other resistant pathogens (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.06\u22122.6, p = 0.03). Conclusion: This nested, matched case-control study identified an important modifiable risk factor for CRKP colonization not identified in the ecological analysis: antibiotic exposure. Antibiotic control programs may have an important role in decreasing the burden of CRKP in PACFs.\n\nO404 Seasonal and ascending trends in the incidence of extended-spectrum b-lactamase-producing E. coli and Klebsiella sp. in two German university hospitals K. Kaier\u00b0, U. Frank, A. Conrad, E. Meyer (Freiburg, Berlin, DE) Objectives: In the present study, the incidence of extended spectrum {b}-lactamase (ESBL) producing strains were analysed for general trends and seasonality. Methods: Monthly data on ESBL producing strains were collected retrospectively at two large university hospitals in the Southwest and Northeast Germany. For the analysis we focussed on E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella oxytoca for consistency both between the two settings and during the study periods. Multivariate time-series analyses were carried out to explain variations in the monthly incidence densities of ESBL cases (E. coli-and/or Klebsiella-related ESBL cases per 1000 patient days) in the two settings (Berlin and Freiburg). For the final models, we were able to incorporate variables for the ascending linear trends and other variables representing the average monthly temperature. Results: Our models show that in general all the incidences of ESBL cases show an increasing trend. In addition, all incidences of ESBL cases responds positively to the average temperature, meaning that in summer when the temperature is high more ESBL cases were detected than during winter months (See Figure for details) . The study methodology was also applied to the incidences of MRSA in the two settings, but an association with the average temperature could not be detected.\n\nIn the present study, we affirmed that ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae are an emerging problem in German hospitals. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the monthly incidence of ESBL strains is highly correlated with the mean monthly temperature, a fact which should be considered in experimental studies as an additional parameter influencing the incidence of ESBL. Introduction: The incidence of invasive candidaemia is increasing all over the world, mainly in critically ill and immunocompromised patients. A shift to non-albicans species and a growing resistance to the common antifungal have been noticed over the last years.\n\nObjectives: Aim of our study was to analyze the different Candida species isolated from bloodstream infections and the related antifungal susceptibility pattern over a three year period at Policlinico Umberto I of Rome. Methods: 7574 blood cultures were analyzed from 2007 to 2009 by both automated and manual methods. Candida species isolates were identified using chromogenic culture media and by API system (Bio-Merieux). VITEK-2 cards were used to perform the antifungal agents sensitivity to the following drugs: flucytosine, amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole. To determine the susceptibility or resistance patterns, CLSI breakpoints were used.\n\nThe overall incidence of invasive candidaemia during the three years under study was 4.75% with a marked increase from 2007 to 2009 (3.85% to 7.5%). The species isolated were the following: C. albicans 37.6%, non-albicans species 62.4% (C. krusei 30.2%, C. glabrata 21.7%, C. parapsilosis 5.6%, C. tropicalis 3.8%, C. lusitaniae 1.1%). We observed that the detection of C. albicans raised from 7.1% in 2007 to 55.5% in 2009, whereas C. krusei, C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis incidence decreased over the three year period. C. glabrata isolation was almost the same during the whole period (28.6% in 2007, 22.2% in 2009). As far as C. albicans is concerned, we noticed an increase of resistance to amphotericin B (from 0% in 2007 to 6.6% in 2009) and voriconazole (from 0% in 2007 to 13.4% in 2009). C. krusei showed a raising resistance to amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole (from 0% to 40%, from 25% to 80%, from 25% to 50%, from 0% to 20%, respectively). In C. glabrata a marked increased of resistance to all the antifungal agents was observed. All the isolates of C. parapsilosis were resistant to voriconazole; in contrast, C. tropicalis was susceptible to all antimycotic agents. Conclusions: Our study confirms the high incidence of candidaemia in the setting of critically ill patients. C. albicans resulted to be the most prevalent species. The overall rate of resistance increased over the study period in all the Candida strains under consideration. ; neonatology, 32.5%; major heart surgery, 21.3%; and paediatric, 5%. We selected only 1 isolate per episode (83 isolates; 3 patients were co-infected by 2 different species). Antifungal susceptibility to fluconazole and voriconazole was determined using the CLSI M27-A3 microdilution procedure.\n\nThe 80 fungemia episodes were caused by C. albicans (n = 32; 40%), C. parapsilosis (n = 27; 33.8%), C. glabrata (n = 9; 11.2%), C. tropicalis (n = 6; 7.5%), C. albicans + C. parapsilosis (n = 3;\n\n3.8%), Arxula adeninivorans (n = 1; 1.2%), Rhodotorula mucilaginosa (n = 1; 1.2%), and Trichosporon inkin (n = 1; 1.2% Results: A total of 198 patients were included into the study, 10 ICU patients (5%) developed invasive Candida infections. Age, gender, SAPS II and euroSCORE of patients, the type and duration of cardiothoracic procedures and parenteral nutrition were no significant risk factors in our study population. In all invasive Candida infection patients severe Candida colonization (p < 0.001), leukocytosis >14 G/l or leukopenia <4 G/l (p = 0.03) and a SOFA score >8 (p = 0.002) were found. The risk for invasive Candida infections in cardiothoracic ICU patients was calculated using the following determinants: severe Candida colonization, leukocytosis or leucopenia, highest SOFA score >8, redo surgical procedures >2 and additional GIT surgery. Conclusion: Cardiothoracic ICU patients are at risk for invasive Candida infections at the presence of severe Candida colonization, leukocytosis or leucopenia, a SOFA score >8, additional GIT surgery and when undergoing multiple cardiothoracic interventions >3. Objectives: Candida bloodstream infections cause significant morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. While clinical and microbiologic factors affecting prognosis have been identified, the impact of immune responses, mediated by cytokines, on outcomes of infection remains to be studied. The present study assessed the role of genetic variation in cytokine genes on susceptibility and/or clinical outcomes of candidaemia. Methods: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in six cytokine genes (IFN-g, IL-10, IL-12B, IL-18, IL-1B, IL-8) and one cytokine receptor gene (IL-12RB) were genotyped and analyzed with logistic regression in 365 patients with candidaemia and 351 non-infected controls. In addition, the presence of these SNPs and measured concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines were further analyzed for association with persistent fungemia ( 5 days of positive blood cultures) in 325 Americans with candidaemia. Other variables were assessed including type of Candida spp. identified, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), dialysis dependence, malignancy, immunocompromised state, renal/liver failure. Variables with p < 0.10 on univariate analysis were further analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. Results: None of the SNPs examined were associated with susceptibility to candidaemia. Mean age of candidaemia patients was 55 years (\u00b121.3), with 44% female, 32% African American, 58% immunocompromised, 31% active malignancy, 10% neutropenic, 43% recent surgery, 21% receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN), 12% dialysis, 25% liver disease, and 49% ICU residence. The following species were identified: C. albicans (43%), C. glabrata (27%), C. parapsilosis (17%), C. tropicalis (12%), C. krusei (3%), >1 Candida species (6% In addition, significantly lower pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations were measured in serum from patients with persistent fungemia. Conclusions: SNPs in IL-10 and IL12B were associated with persistent fungemia in candidaemia patients, which also associated with low serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This may provide insights for future targeted management strategies for patients with this high mortality condition.\n\nObjective: Mortality from Candida bloodstream infections (CBSI) is high if not treated adequately. In recent clinical trials of CBSI, treatment with an echinocandin resulted in higher success rates. However, superiority has not been demonstrated. Given similarities in trial design and definitions, data from these trials can be combined in a metaanalysis. We compared the efficacy, measured as global clinical success at the end of intravenous therapy, of an echinocandin vs. a comparator AF agent in the treatment of CBSI. Methods: We used standard metaanalysis methodology and a random effect model. We conducted a literature search to identify all randomized, controlled, trials (RCTs), assessing the efficacy of an echinocandin (caspofungin, micafungin, anidulafungin) in CSBI. To evaluate whether the comparator (fluconazole or amphotericin preparations) success rates were consistent with previously published data, we conducted an additional literature search of all RCTs in which these agents were evaluated. Articles were reviewed independently by 2 reviewers. The corresponding authors and sponsors were approached for additional data. Results: 8 RCTs were included: 3 comparing an echinocandin to comparator antifungal (CAF), 1 comparing two echinocandins, and 4 comparing amphotericin preparations to fluconazole. The summary odds ratio for global success was 1.58 (95% CI 1.07-3.54) in favor of echinocandin therapy. The removal of a high-recruiting center that had a high anidulafungin response-rate had an insignificant impact on the results (OR 0. 1.46 95% CI 1.10-1.94). Global success rates observed in all included RCTs of fluconazole (5 treatment arms), amphotericin (4 arms) and the echinocandins (5 arms) were 62%, 73%, and 83%, respectively. In the echinocandin trials, success rates observed in the CAF arms were consistent with prior published trials. In an additional analysis that included only CBSI caused by C. albicans, echinocandin therapy resulted in higher success rate vs the CAF (74%; 95% CI 69\u221278% vs 59%; 95% CI 51\u221266%).\n\nIn patients with CBSI, as compared to amphotericin preparations or fluconazole, echinocandin therapy is associated with higher global success rates. This better effect is maintained when restricting the analysis to C. albicans, suggesting that effectiveness differences may be unrelated to the level of fluconazole susceptibility. Objectives: Neonates in intensive care units were susceptible of having blood stream infections because of invasive procedures and underdeveloped immune system. Prolonged hospitalization and broad spectrum antibiotics further risk the development of candidemia. This report was written to share the success story in controlling the candidemia after a major outbreak in 2004 by adopting strict infection control practice, in which indirectly resulted in the reduction of candidemia in our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).\n\nMethods: This is a retrospective laboratory based analysis study from January 2001 to August 2009. Spectrum and distribution of Candida isolated from blood cultures taken from the NICU at Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia before and after a major outbreak in 2004 was analyzed. The prevalence of candidemia before and after outbreak was compared and the trends of Candida spp. were determined. Candida spp. was identified using standard microbiological tests and a commercialized identification system, API-32C system. Results: Altogether, 413 Candida were isolated during the study period. Generally, there was a significant reduction in the prevalence of candidemia after 2004 for both Candida albicans and non-albicans. The reduction was sustained for the past five years. Candida parapsilosis (40%) was the predominant species isolated followed by Candida albicans (24.8%), Candida glabrata (15.2%) and Candida tropicalis (12.4%). Conclusion: Adherence to strict infection control practice is important to control candidemia. Candida parapsilosis was the major species implicated in candidemia among our neonates.\n\nO412 Is there any factor prompting early central venous catheters removal from cancer patients with candidaemia?\n\nBackground: Few studies have addressed the timing of CVC removal as a prognostic factor of mortality in cancer patients with candidemia. Objective: To evaluated the clinical factors associated with early central venous catheter removal in cancer patients with candidemia who survived >3 days after the index blood culture. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis from a candidemia study conducted between January 2001 and June 2005 at an oncology cancer center in Brazil. Eligible patients were those whose catheters were eventually removed. We excluded patients who died within 72 h after the candidemia onset or had catheters in place for 48 h. Early catheter removal was defined as those catheters withdrawn 72 h after the onset of candidemia. Results: We enrolled 164 patients with a 10.4% overall mortality rate. Multivariate analysis revealed the temporary nontunneled central venous catheter type (OR, 5.06; 95% CI 2.16-11.83) as the only variable independently associated with early removal. Among the 82 episodes not catheter related, 52 catheters (63%) were removed at doctor's discretion due to the urgency for cancer treatment continuance. Most of these removal (n = 46) occurred within 3 days of the index blood culture. No differences in the overall mortality rates were seen among patients with early or delayed catheters removal (P > 0.05). Nevertheless, stratified analysis showed a survival benefit (P = 0.04) of early removal in the subgroup of patients with performance Karnofsky score >60.\n\nThis study showed short-term nontunneled central venous catheter type as the only factor associated with early catheter removal. There were a high proportion of removed catheters with the purpose of not interrupting the underlying cancer treatment. Overall, early catheter removal did not have a beneficial impact on mortality. Nevertheless, the observed favorable survival benefit of early over late catheter removal in the subgroup of patients without significant medical illnesses merits further investigation. Clinical trials enrolling sufficient number of homogeneous patients are necessary to analyze the impact of central venous catheter management on the outcome of cancer patients with candidemia.\n\nStrategies to stay one step ahead of bacteria (Symposium supported by Janssen-Cilag) S413 The bacterial challenge: time to react\n\nThe changing pattern of antimicrobial resistance presents a challenge which needs to be met on many fronts. This, combined with the lack of development of new antimicrobials, necessitates a review of current treatment strategies. Strategies which will be discussed in this symposium will include the benefits of appropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment for serious infections, and more rational ways of administration (higher doses and varying infusion times) of some antimicrobials. Resistance development is well monitored in Europe, with resources such as the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS), and additional country and local surveillance (e.g. PEG-surveillance in Germany, Austria and Switzerland). Data will be presented on resistance profiles and evolution rates within the intensive care unit, where the challenge is to contain and prevent the spread of resistance. These data are critical for the rational choice of adequate empirical antibiotic treatment which will not lead to failure. This can be achieved using broad-spectrum, potent agents, which are least likely to select for resistance, before changing to a more targeted therapy (de-escalation) once susceptibilities have been determined. These methods allow us to use our limited armamentarium effectively. If this approach is not followed, the risk of failure and increased mortality associated with initial inadequate antibiotic treatment, the emergence of resistant strains while on therapy, and their subsequent spread to others, are the main consequences. The number of new antibiotics to treat multidrugresistant pathogens in the pipeline are too few, particularly those against Gram-negative bacteria and those with new mechanisms of action. New strategies are needed to close the gap between the burden of infections due to multidrug-resistant bacteria and the development of new antibiotics.\n\nThe development of resistance to antibiotics has long been a thorn in the side of the infectious disease physician. Dr Livermore will discuss current resistance issues from a microbiological perspective. The concept of potency and how it relates to minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and breakpoints will be covered, with particular reference to carbapenems and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, where simple mutations leading to loss of the 'carbapenem-specific' porin OprD can confer frank resistance to imipenem whereas resistance to meropenem or doripenem additionally requires some upregulation of efflux. For reasons that remain obscure, these latter combinations of mechanism usually have a lesser effect on doripenem MICs than those of meropenem. In these circumstances there is potential for the dosing of carbapenems to affect the likelihood of resistance development, though any practical significance remains to be confirmed in clinical studies, particularly for the meropenem / doripenem comparison. In contrast to P. aeruginosa, carbapenem-resistance in Acinetobacter spp. is due to OXA-carbapenemases. Some low-level producers may remain marginally susceptible to imipenem (not meropenem or doripenem) but there seems little general scope to overcome resistance by dosage adjustment for any of the compounds. Among Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem resistance can arise either via combinations of porin loss together with production of extended-spectrum or AmpC-lactamases or via the production of true carbapenemases. The former mechanism, mostly seen in Klebsiella or Enterobacter spp. affects ertapenem more than any other analogue and this compound therefore seems most likely to act as a selector; the true carbapenemases \u2212 including IMP, VIM and NDM (New Delhi Metallo) zinc-enzymes as well as the KPC and OXA-48 serine types affect all carbapenems, and it seems unlikely that any could be overcome by dosage adjustment, though some might, in the future, be overcome by carbapenem/inhibitor combinations.\n\nConsideration of pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) principles can be useful to optimise dosing of b-lactam antibiotics. b-lactams have time-dependent action, with time above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) critical for maximum efficacy. PK/PD data can be used in Monte Carlo simulations to predict probabilities of obtaining an exposure target for a given dose. Evidence from Monte Carlo simulations, animal models and clinical studies have led to realworld recommendations, such as using extended infusions and other strategies to maximise efficiency of b-lactams. Prolonged and continuous infusions can give better efficacy, can lower the likelihood of resistance developing through higher trough levels and eliminate or at least reduce the need to increase the dose. b-lactam antibiotics that can be dosed via continuous/prolonged infusions include penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems. However, data should be assessed for each antimicrobial. For example, doripenem exhibits linear pharmacokinetics and does not accumulate with repeated dosing over 7 days, which supports its use as a prolonged infusion. Dr Pea will compare differences between carbapenems and classic b-lactams. Dosing strategies for different carbapenems will be discussed, including their stability and safety profiles. Practical considerations for prolonged infusions include having knowledge of the relationship of serum levels to target organ levels for different antimicrobials and an awareness of differences in PK and PD parameters among diverse patient groups. Dr Pea will conclude with a discussion on which particular patient populations, such as those with Pseudomonas infection, may benefit most from continuous infusions. He will also discuss the effect of different comorbidities, such as use in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and with renal failure or glomerular hyperfiltration, and how their pathophysiology can affect drug levels.\n\nDr Welte will discuss b-lactams which are newly approved and in late-stage development from a clinical perspective. Discussion will include summaries of in vivo data including pivotal clinical studies, recent meta-analysis, such as activity studies against Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter, and new clinical data on carbapenems, such as doripenem data dosed at 1 g. The use of intravenous antibiotics for patients with renal failure will be discussed, including considerations when using hemofiltration and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).\n\nComparative safety data will be presented for the carbapenems and recent health economic and hospital utilization datasets will also be discussed. Dr Welte will illustrate his talk with examples, particularly of patients who have failed therapy, with reasons for failure, which can be complex. Techniques and approaches to minimise the possibility of treatment failure will be discussed, such as appropriate initial empiric treatment and prolonged infusion. The presentation will conclude with a brief review of b-lactams currently in the pipeline including ceftobiprole, ceftaroline, and faropenem.\n\nS422 Epidemiology of human cytomegalovirus with focus on mother/child transmission G. Jahn\u00b0 (Tubingen, DE) Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) affects 30-100% of adults worldwide depending on geography and lifestyle by the age of 40 years. Two possible sources of sexual transmission of HCMV are virus in the female cervix and in semen of men. The frequency of HCMV infection in adults correlates with the number of sexual partners and sexual experience. This b-herpesvirus is the virus most commonly transmitted to the fetus before birth, occurring in 0.3\u22122% of all live births. Another even much more frequent transmission route of mother-child is breastfeeding.\n\nThe local viral reactivation of the HCMV antibody positive mothers during lactation is highly frequent and self limited and follows unimodal kinetics. The vertical transmission rate from mother to child is about 40%. Also horizontal HCMV transmission from newborns and young children to their mothers or other individuals taken care of those infants happens. Children may shed the virus in saliva and urine for months or years, but the relative portion of this kind of horizontal transmission from children to children or from children to adults is unknown. Also the horizontal transmission among adults, besides sexual intercourse, is not well descript, but unlikely. In medical care, HCMV can be transmitted by blood products or organ transplantation. As with all other herpesviruses, HCMV has the ability to establish latent/silent infection in the host after primary infection. Activation from silent infection can occur under immunosuppression, during pregnancy and during lactation. Individuals can be infected with multiple strains, meaning secondary infection as exogenous reinfection or endogenous reactivation may occur. HCMV disease with various symptoms can result from either primary or secondary infection, also in primary infection disease is more severe and more frequent. The outcome of congenital HCMV infection is variable. About 10\u221215% of infected newborns exhibit clinical symptoms at birth such as CNS sequelae with hearing loss, cognitive impairment and cerebral palsy. Remarkably from 85\u221290% of HCMV infected newborns who are asymptomatic at birth will later develop hearing loss in about 15%. In both symptomatic and clinical asymptomatic newborns, sequelae often are not apparent in the first months or years of life. That all is an urgent need for specific HCMV diagnostic procedures and interpretations for pregnant women and newborns to guide the solid management of fetal/infant infection.\n\nThe growth of antimicrobial resistance, and in particular the proliferation of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, means that carbapenems are increasingly front line therapy for nosocomial infections. In consequence numerous carbapenem-hydrolysing b-lactamases have emerged and begun to disseminate across geographic and species boundaries. Several class A carbapenemases have now been described. Of these the KPC enzymes are of the most immediate clinical relevance. Growing numbers of reports indicate the presence of KPC variants in Enterobacteriaceae, notably from the Eastern United States and Israel but also in China and a number of South American and European countries. KPC-expressing isolates frequently contain additional b-lactamases as well as other resistance determinants, severely limiting treatment options and affecting patient outcomes.\n\nAlthough class A carbapenemases have been extensively studied, the molecular basis for this activity has remained obscure in light of their close structural resemblance to other class A enzymes. It is now established that the acylenzyme formed when carbapenems react with class A b-lactamases such as TEM or SHV can adopt two conformations, and that associated tautomerisation ultimately results in inhibition. However, equivalent studies are yet to be reported for the species formed when carbapenems associate with class A carbapenemases. Using X-ray crystallography we have now studied the interactions of the carbapenem meropenem with a model class A carbapenemase (SFC-1 from Serratia fonticola) in which we have used directed mutagenesis to trap the substrate and acylenzyme complexes. These structures show that SFC-1 binds carbapenems in a single well defined orientation where, in contrast to carbapenem-inhibited enzymes like SHV, the b-lactam amide nitrogen remains close to the active site Ser-130. We propose that this model represents productive binding of substrate and is likely to apply to other class A carbapenemases, including KPC enzymes. One approach to combatting carbapenemase-producing organisms is to combine b-lactams with an appropriate b-lactamase inhibitor. However, available b-lactamase-inhibitor combinations are variably effective against carbapenemase producers. Accordingly, a number of b-lactamase inhibitors under development have been tested against KPC and other class A carbapenemases. Recent results in this area will be reviewed.\n\nMany Gram-negative bacteria, especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacteriaceae, including Enterobacter, Citrobacter and Serratia species, possess chromosomally encoded Class C b-lactamases (AmpC) that are important determinants of resistance towards a broad range of b-lactam antibiotics. Even carbapenems lose activity when confronted with class C lactamases if the organism also has restricted outer membrane permeability. For example, loss of the OprD outer membrane porin of P. aeruginosa, which is essential for the rapid entry of imipenem into the periplasm, will lead to high-level resistance if a class C b-lactamase is expressed. In the last decades, a number of AmpC enzymes have been mobilized on plasmids or other genetic elements and have spread to organisms such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae that did not usually express AmpC. Carbapenem-resistant strains of K. pneumoniae that have altered porin expression and a plasmid-encoded AmpC b-lactamase have been reported from several countries. In general, class C lactamases are not well inhibited by the clinically available b-lactamase inhibitors clavulanic acid, sulbactam and tazobactam. Insights into the mechanism of class C b-lactamases have aided the rational design of specific inhibitors for this group of enzymes that also have the potential to been optimized for penetration of the outer membrane of P. aeruginosa. This presentation will review the fundamental steps in the mechanism of class C b-lactamases and how this knowledge can be applied to the design of novel inhibitors.\n\nThe catalytic efficiency of the class D b-lactamase depends critically on an unusual carboxylated lysine as the general base residue for both the enzyme acylation and deacylation steps of catalysis. Different class D b-lactamase's X-ray structures indicate that the active site Lys-70 is surrounded by a hydrophobic core comprising residues such as Val-117, Phe-120 and Trp-154. Evidence is presented that the interaction between the indole group of Trp154 and the carboxylated lysine is essential for the stability of the post-translationally modified Lys70. Substitution of Trp154 by Gly, Ala or Phe yielded non carboxylated enzymes which displayed poor catalytic efficiencies and reduced stability when compared to the wild type OXA-10. A comparison of the three dimensional structures of the different proteins also indicated that the Trp154 mutations did not modify the overall structures of OXA-10 but induced an increased flexibility of the omega-loop in the active site.\n\nFinally, the deacylation impaired W154A mutant was used to determine the structure of the acyl-enzyme complex with benzylpenicillin. Stoppedflow and quenched-flow experiments indicate that the deacylation step is clearly rate limiting for the OXA-10 b-lactamase. The observation of acyl-enzyme complex with the K70C mutant by X-ray crystallography also suggests that the deacylation step is rate limiting but the acylation step is also affected for the lysine mutants. Indeed, the values of the acylation constants (k2) are clearly lower than with the wild-type enzyme. The catalytic efficencies of the V117T mutant decrease for all substrates tested. The structure of the V117T OXA-10 mutant indicates that the Lys-70 is partially carboxylated at pH 8.0 in monomer A whereas monomer B contains a non-carboxylated Lys-70. This confirms that the valine residue in the hydrophobic core is important to promote the carboxylation of the Lys-70. It has been reported that class D b-lactamases are inhibited by chloride ions. Interestingly, in we could show that the inhibiton is due to the replacement of the side chain carboxylate group of the modified lysine by chloride ion. Finally, the structural modifications induced also the apparition of a detectable carbapenemase activity in OXA variants. Finally, the deep analysis of structure-function relationship for class D b-lactamases yielded a new approach for the selection and synthesis of new inhibitors.\n\nCommunity-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has emerged as a major health problem world-wide. CA-MRSA is a frequent cause of skin and soft-tissue infections, and has also been reported to cause rapidly progressing life-threatening infections with unusually severe pathology, including necrotizing pneumonia, severe sepsis and necrotizing fasciitis. A large number of epidemiological and clinical studies have established a strong association between these severe CA-MRSA infections and strains harbouring the pore-forming toxin Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL). Although compelling, epidemiological data alone is insufficient to establish a role of PVL in disease pathogenesis. However, this issue has been addressed in a large number of studies utilizing different experimental systems including PVL-deficient mutants and various in vivo models. The results of these studies have been highly conflicting, and consequently, this topic is a matter of great debate in the staphylococcal field. The current progress toward understanding the enhanced virulence potential of CA-MRSA with special emphasis on PVL, but also including other relevant staphylococcal virulence factors, will be summarized and discussed during this talk.\n\nHealthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) infection is now widespread throughout the world. Recently, new strains of community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) have emerged that affect people with no history of healthcare contact. These are community strains of MSSA that have acquired mecA. They are generally more virulent than HA-MRSA and can cause primary infection in healthy people, including children. CA-MRSA often possess genes encoding the putative virulence factor Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL). CA-MRSA clones can be defined by multilocus sequence (ST) and SCCmec type. CA-MRSA have appeared in most countries of the world. They are common in the USA and much less common, but increasing, elsewhere. There are many different clones whose distribution differs geographically. Some are particularly successful. USA300 (ST8-IV PVL+) has replaced USA400 (ST1-IV PVL+) as the commonest type in the USA. The 'European clone' (ST80-IV PVL+)\n\nis common in Europe and the 'South West Pacific' clone (ST30-IV PVL+) in the Far East and South America. In Europe there is great clonal diversity and new types are continually being reported, including the pigassociated ST398 strain (usually PVL\u2212) that is common in Denmark and the Netherlands but now spreading elsewhere. Although new CA-MRSA clones continue to appear, successful older ones are being introduced into new geographical areas by travellers and immigrants. CA-MRSA pneumonia is uncommon worldwide but increasing. It may follow influenza in previously healthy people and may cause fatal necrotizing disease, usually associated with PVL-producing CA-MRSA. PVL-positive staphylococci produce necrotizing pneumonia in animal experiments but the role of PVL in human disease is still under debate. Although PVL+ USA300 is the most frequent strain causing pneumonia, this may be because it is common; it remains to be seen whether other types of CA-MRSA, including PVL\u2212 strains, also have this ability. With the continuing spread of CA-MRSA and the on-going influenza pandemic, we can expect the incidence of severe CA-MRSA pneumonia to increase. HA-MRSA pneumonia in ventilated patients is well recognised and has a poor prognosis. CA-MRSA is now spreading in hospitals and becoming increasingly multi-drug resistant (MDR). Physicians should be aware of the threat of hospital-acquired pneumonia with virulent, PVLproducing MDR CA-MRSA and national and international organisations should provide appropriate surveillance systems for CA-MRSA.\n\nMany patients require a central venous catheter or an arterial line. Although indispensable and of benefit, vascular access devices pose a potential risk of complications due to central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI). The risk for CLABSI varies between 1 to 7 episodes or more per 1000 catheter-days depending on ward-type, institution and socio-economic status of the country. Most successful CLABSI prevention strategies are multimodal and include a combination of effective single intervention measures. Some measures are \"procedural\", such as using maximal sterile barrier precautions at catheter insertion, avoiding the femoral site, strict hand hygiene and applying a non-touch technique for catheter handling, opening hubs on antiseptic-impregnated pads, change of tubing only when indicated, and avoiding unnecessary access to the system. Furthermore, any indication for a central line insertion must be justified and catheters should be removed as soon as possible. Other intervention measures are more \"technical\", such as chlorhexidinecontaining products for skin antisepsis, chlorhexidine dressings at the catheter insertion site, impregnated catheters with antibiotics or chlorhexidine and silver-sulfadiazine, access devices coated with silver particles, and closed infusion systems. A promising approach in CLABSI prevention is the use of lock-solutions consisting of taurolidine-citrate, ethanol, EDTA or citrate/methylene-blue/paraben. Although there is evidence that some intervention combinations or bundles are effective, no specific combination should be considered superior to another. However, effort, complexity and costs may limit the possibility to apply all measures together. Even more important, infection prevention measures, and especially procedures, are of no use if they are not respected in daily practice. Most episodes of CLABSI are identified in the intensive care unit where care is complex. In such an environment, attention may be drawn away from infection control measures. Thus, infection control measures must be simple and easy to integrate into daily practice. Furthermore, it is indispensable to promote an infection control culture among nurses and physicians to ensure that prevention measures are observed under stress conditions. Although technical devices may be of help in stress situations, the failure to adopt a safety culture cannot be replaced by the use of impregnated catheters, chlorhexidine dressings or lock solutions.\n\nAntimicrobials against biofilm-based catheter-related infections: new perspectives. In the last decades, different strategies have been developed to prevent microbial colonization of intravascular catheters through surface adsorption or incorporation in the device polymer matrix of antibiotic/antifungal agents. However, the currently available medicated catheters have shown to inhibit microbial biofilm formation for relatively short periods, mainly due to the massive release of the loaded antimicrobial agents in the first 24 h followed by a slow release at sub-inhibitory concentrations until drug exhaustion, this phenomenon involving the risk of emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains. To overcome these limitations, we focused our research efforts in developing different experimental approaches to prevent microbial colonization of central venous catheters based on the adsorption of antimicrobial agents to synthesized and properly functionalized polyurethanes with the aim to control drug adsorption and release. Firstly, we have impregnated appropriately functionalized polyurethanes with two antibiotics with different mechanisms of action, rifampicin and cefamandole nafate, along with pore forming agents such as albumin and polyethylene glycol. This in vitro model exhibited a good polymer/antibiotic affinity and the ability to obtain a controlled release of large amounts of antimicrobials for up to 23 days. These results suggest that the entrapping of antibiotic molecules and pore-formers in properly functionalized polyurethanes may represent a promising approach to prevent catheter colonization and onset of bacterial resistance. Other antibiofilm strategies we are dealing with concern: i) the development of antimicrobial polymers by the use of polyurethanes able to coordinate metal ions (Ag+, Zn2+, etc); ii) the exploiting of the biofilm matrix-degrading enzyme, Dispersin B, to allow a better penetration of antibiotics through the microbial biofilm, thus improving their activity; iii) the development of a magnetic nanoparticles-based targeting system to fight catheter-related infections by an in situ, on demand, antimicrobial treatment.\n\nThis presentation will focus on the changing epidemiology of fevers imported from this region reflected in travel infection databases, and use brief vignettes to highlight important clinical diagnostic and management issues. As in all travellers, a detailed travel, exposure and immunisation history is essential, combined with knowledge of patient comorbidities that may predispose to acquiring certain infections. In general, malaria is less likely to be the cause of fever than other infections, contrasting strongly with the differential diagnosis in travellers arriving from Africa. However, recent increases in malaria transmission in tourist areas such as Goa remind us of the need to maintain a high index of suspicion and continually to review pretravel advice on prevention. The emergence of artemesinin resistance in the Thai-Myanmar border area is a concern for the future.\n\nIn most recently returned travellers, arbovirus infections such as dengue and chikungunya are common causes of fever and can be confirmed using molecular techniques in the first week of illness and serological tests thereafter. Importation of scrub typhus is less common than is tick typhus in travellers from Africa. Leptopirosis is associated with fresh water activities popular with tourists in South East Asia, such as white water rafting and \"tubing\", but imported schistosomiasis from this area is rare. Eosinophilia is more likely to be due to other enteric or systemic helminth or fluke infections. Enteric fevers are common in travellers from the Indian subcontinent, with recent predominance of paratyphoid A, which is often resistant to fluoroquinolones and multidrug resistant to other first line agents. Empirical treatment while awaiting culture results and resistance data should avoid such agents and include a third generation cefalosporin and/or azithromycin. Antimicrobial resistance is common in infections imported from this area, including extended spectrum b-lactamase producing Gram negative bacteria, and multidrug resistant tuberculosis. Respiratory infections are common in any traveller, and influenza has been demonstrated to be the most frequent vaccine preventable infection acquired by tourists in South East Asia. Recent experience with SARS and ongoing concerns in the region about avian influenza remind us of the continued risk in this region of the emergence of novel virus infections spread by the respiratory route.\n\nIn a study performed by Geo Sentinel and published recently, it was found that, among North Americans, fever after a travel to South America is not very common and that it includes malaria, salmonellosis, dengue, etc.\n\nIt is important to make geographic distinctions: 1. In Mexico: amebiasis, hepatic abscess and typhoid fever should always be included. 2. In Central America: typhoid fever and dengue are the main causes of fever. Histoplasmosis and toxoplasmosis have been detected in immunosuppressed patients. 3. In South America: Malaria by P. falciparum and P. vivax are frequent causes of fever. Since 1991, the frequency of typhoid has decreased with more than 90%. The strains of S. typhi continue to be sensitive to chloramphenicol, ampicilline and fluoroquinolones. By contrast with Asia, multidrug resistant strains have not been detected. Dengue and enteric hepatitis are frequent causes of fever. In Peru, brucellosis (as well as in Mexico and Venezuela) and bartonellosis should be considered as important diseases. Occasionally, regional mycoses such as histoplasmosis (exposure to caves) and paracoccidioidomycosis are seen.\n\nJ. Van den Ende\u00b0(Antwerp, BE) Kabisa, a computer based tutorial for tropical medicine, has been developed since 1992, the first version in foxpro, the second in C++, the third in MS Access XP, and the last in Delphi. (Van den Ende et al. 1997a ) For developing countries it is a didactic tool that challenges the student with cases electronically assembled from a randomly generated disease and randomly chosen related presenting symptoms. The student should find the diagnosis with a set of disease characteristics, available in the context of a hospital in developing countries. The logical engine is based upon both pattern recognition and Bayesian logic. For a Western context the programme offers also an expert system for imported fever, based on a prospectively generated database of over 2000 patients. The expert module is innovative with the suggestion of new tests based on the data already provided by the user. In this suggestion, a threshold driven logic is followed: (Pauker & Kassirer 1980) for the highest ranked diagnosis strong excluders are asked for, once this diagnosis is worked out less probable hypotheses are examined also. Ranking of suggested tests takes into account power, feasibility, risk and cost. During the session, real examples will be played and the application of the logic shown. If wanted, detailed explanation of the programming can be given. Participants are invited to bring their laptop; the program will be installed and distributed for free. Reference(s) [1] Pauker, S.

Schilling, H. Brodt, R. Gottschalk, B. Bannister, P. Brouqui, F.M. Fusco\u00b0, H.C. Maltezou, G. Thomson, V. Puro, G Conclusion: According to preliminary data analysis, generally the hospital resources in isolation are adequate, despite the fact that different levels of preparedness among different countries are still present, in particular in the field of intensive care capabilities and availability of trained staff. These data will represent a valuable tool both for surveyed facilities, in order to identify their strengths and weaknesses, and for European authorities, providing an \"on-the-field\" evaluation of European hospitals' capabilities in dealing with HIDs. , Greece (n = 2), Italy (n = 1), Latvia (n = 1), Luxemburg (n = 1), Portugal (n = 2), Slovenia (n = 2) and Spain (n = 1). Observations were performed by trained research nurses at random dates, times and bed spaces during 6 months using a standardized protocol derived from the WHO \"5 moments\" method. No feedback of results or training of staff was allowed. A standardized test was used to assess inter-observer variation. Results: The mean bed occupancy rate was 85% (58\u221299%) and ICUs had on average 13.11 (9\u221221) beds, with 61% of patients being ventilated (43\u221281%). The average nurse-to-patient ratio (per occupied bed) was 0.52 (0.34-0.91). HHC rates varied from 7% to 88% (mean: 48%). Nurses' HHC was higher than physicians' HHC (mean: 51 vs 39%) in all but two centers. Auxiliary nurses and other healthcare workers had intermediate HHC (42% and 44%, respectively). When separated per indication category (i.e. hand hygiene before and after actions that require hand hygiene), HHC was higher in the latter group (43 vs 57%, p = 0.003). 45% of missed hand hygiene opportunities involved the use of gloves, mainly before performing an aseptic task or after possible body fluid contact. Gloves were used in 47% of opportunities missed by nurses compared to 30% for physicians (p = 0.005 O468 Achieving sustained improvement in hospital hygienic cleaning using peer-group benchmarking P. Carling\u00b0, B. Dick, E. Eck (Boston, Toledo, Passadena, US) Objectives: Ongoing contamination of surfaces in the \"patient zone\" (Pittet 2007) has become increasingly recognized as playing a role in the transmission of major healthcare-associated pathogens. Over the past five years an indirect monitoring system has been used to improve environmental hygiene related to discharge cleaning in almost 100 hospitals. In view of these results, we undertook a prospective evaluation of a multi-hospital benchmarking program to further analyze this approach for improving the thoroughness of disinfection cleaning (TDC) at discharge.\n\nThe TDC of fourteen high touch objects was evaluated using a fluorescent dye based targeting method in two hospital systems consisting of 12 hospitals (Group A) and 7 hospitals (Group B) administratively related within each group but geographically and functionally independent institutions. A three phase intervention was utilized as previously described (ICHE 2008; 29: 1035\u221241) . TDC scores were provided to the environmental services administration at each hospital and on a regular basis as part of system-wide quality assurance reviews for each system. At each meeting TDC scores were reviewed and the most effective programmatic and educational interventions shared.\n\nResults: As noted in the Figure, and 2,132 patients in G2. Among all the treated patients, G2 received less AM combination (G1: 33%; G2: 24%) and parenteral AM (G1: 65%; G2: 57%). The top three AM classes prescribed were similar in both groups and corresponded to combinations of penicillins with b-lactamase inhibitors (G1: 18%; G2: 24%), fluoroquinolones (G1: 12%; G2: 14%) and third-generation cephalosporins (6% for both groups). Infections represented 74% and 83% of all indications in G1 and G2, respectively. Respiratory tract infections were the commonest infections in both groups (G1: 29%; G2: 33%) followed by skin-soft-tissues-and-bonejoint infections in G1 (18%) and urinary tract infections in G2 (23%). The proportion of surgical prophylaxis was lower in the oldest patients (G1: 69%; G2: 66%). The >1 day duration of surgical prophylaxis was 54% in both groups. The prescribed doses for 5 parenteral AM, i.e. benzylpenicillin, gentamicin, cefuroxime, piperacillin-tazobactam, and vancomycin were higher in G1 whilst amoxycillin and cefazolin were higher in G2.\n\nThe results of this study showed differences between the 2 elderly age groups, particularly in the proportion of AM combination, parenteral use, and infection site. It became clear that in line with the improved quality of life of the elderly population in industrialized countries, the treatment of G1 is more comparable to that of younger adults. Importantly, future analyses on AM use should take several age groups of the elderly population into consideration. In 20 NH no residents received AB. In the total NHpopulation 4% (0\u221257%) had an urinary catheter, and of these, 17% received an AB. Wounds were present in 10% of the population (0\u221275%) and AB were prescribed in 15% of them. Vascular catheters were uncommon (0.78%) but 36% of this sub-population used an AB. Among residents with AB, 24% had a recent hospital stay. In total 1757 AB molecules were used. AB were administered orally in 90%, parenteral in 9% and nasal (decolonisation MRSA) in 1%. 53% of all treatments concerned urinary tract (prophylactic: 55%) and 29% the respiratory tract (empirical: 92%). 51% of all prescribed regimens were empirical treatments (RTI: 53%, UTI: 23%), 32% was prophylactic (UTI: 89%, RTI: 5%) and 16% was for a documented infection (UTI: 72%). The prevalence of AB use was significantly lower in NH with regular training of prescribers (p = 0.02), with written guidelines for appropriate AB-use (p = 0.01) or with a NH therapeutic formulary (p = 0.0002) compared to NH without these tools. Conclusion: Strong differences in AB-prevalence and device-use were observed in EU NH. Both micro (case-mix)-and macro determinants (cultural differences) partially contribute to these differences. The high proportion of AB-use for urinary tract, especially the important part of uroprophylaxis, was surprising and needs to be explored. A median of 9.7% (11.7% mean) of all NH residents (n = 26,063) was diagnosed with an undefined wound. Among residents treated with ABs (n = 1734), 24% had a wound. However, when considering woundand AB prevalence (dichotomized above and below the median) at institutional level there was no significant relation (p = 0.19). Of the AB using residents 2.5% was treated (i.e. prophylactic, empirical or documented) for a wound infection (WI). Among AB using residents with wounds 7% was treated for a WI. Remarkable is that 1.5% of the residents reported not to have wounds was treated for a WI. Of the AB treated NH residents that were admitted to a hospital within the last three months, 35% had a wound. Of those without hospital admission, 20% had a wound (p < 0.0001). Escherichia coli accounted for 47% of the microorganisms (MOs) detected among residents without a wound, in contrast to only 24% (p = 0.0002) for residents with a wound. Methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus was found among 15% of residents with a wound, and 4% of those without (p = 0.00015).\n\nResidents with a wound received more often empirical (55%) or documented AB treatments (22%) than residents without a wound (49%, p = 0.045 and 15%, p = 0.0012, respectively). Prophylactic ABs were used less for patients with (22%) than for those without wounds (36%, p < 0.0001). Residents with in contrast to those without wounds received more often combinations of penicillins and b-lactamase inhibitors (J01CR, 21% vs. 13%, respectively, p < 0.0001) and cephalosporins (J01D, 13% vs. 7%, p = 0.012). On the contrary, residents with wounds received other antimicrobials (J01X) significantly less (18% vs.31%, p < 0.0001). Finally, residents with compared to those without wounds received less often oral ABs (83% vs. 93%, respectively, p < 0.0001) but significantly more often parenteral ABs (15% vs. 7%, p < 0.0001).\n\nThe presence of wounds does not seem to significantly influence AB prevalence. However, there is a relation between the presence of a wound and recent hospital admission, registered MOs, AB indication, type of AB and route of administration.\n\nObjectives: The aim of the present study is to explore differences in antimicrobial consumption in Belgian hospitals including differences between ward types. This report was restricted to antibacterials for systemic use (WHO-ATC classification J01C). Methods: Belgian hospitals were invited to report their antimicrobial use to the federal Scientific Institute of Public Health (IPH), which was responsible for the data collection, conversion into defined daily doses (DDD), analysis and feed back. The data collected were split up for non-pediatric and pediatric wards. There is also an optional reporting of intensive care wards and hematology-oncology wards.\n\nThe overall results are shown in 1999 -2008 \n\nThe ICU-Strama programme was developed ten years ago and used for regular audit of antibiotic use, antibiotic resistance and infection control procedures in Swedish ICUs. It is a joint project between the ICU-Strama and the Swedish Intensive Care Registry. A central component has been a web-based application which includes a system for automatic feed-back. The purpose of this report is to increase awareness of the usefulness of the programme and provide a ten year trend analysis of antibiotic consumption. Material and Methods: The data on antibiotic consumption based on the anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) classification system were collected from 64 Swedish ICUs and entered into the database using the web application. Antibiotic consumption was expressed as defined daily doses (DDD) per 1,000 occupied bed day (DDD1000). We used the annually updated DDD calculated by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology as the average maintenance dose per day in adults for the main indication of the drug(http://www.whocc.no/atcddd). Data were analysed using the non-parametric test for trend across ordered groups and Spearman's rank correlation using STATA/SE 9.2(StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA) and SPSS version 11.5 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Statistical significance was assumed if P < 0.05.\n\nThe median antibiotic consumption increased from 1,256 DDD1000 1999 to 1,434 DDD1000 2008 . Antibiotic consumption varied widely between different units during 2008, ranging between 696 and 2,722 DDD1000 with a median of 1,434 DDD1000. Trend analyses of usage of different classes of antibiotics were performed and showed increased carbapenem, triazole and piperacillintazobactam consumption (p < 0.001). There was no significant change in consumption of cephalosporins for the ten year period but a trend towards decreased consumption the last two years. No significant correlation between antibiotic consumption and standardised mortality rate was shown. Conclusion: The high antibiotic consumption concurs with figures from European and US ICUs in general, but like a few ICUs in our programme, relatively low antibiotic consumption has been reported from Switzerland. The lower antibiotic consumption suggests that it is possible to reduce antibiotic consumption in the critically ill, but it has to be accompanied with a quality control system to make sure that it does not compromise patient outcomes.\n\nO475 Developing a database to facilitate the assessment of antimicrobial consumption in an acute tertiary hospital L.W. Hoo\u00b0, T. Kyaw Tun, D. Solanki, S. Foley (Dublin, IE) Background: Monitoring antimicrobial consumption trends is part of an effective systematic surveillance programme to prevent and control healthcare-associated infection and antimicrobial resistance. Expressing antimicrobial consumption data in the World Health Organizationrecommended measurement unit \u2212 Defined Daily Dose (DDD) per 100 bed-days, is important for benchmarking purposes. This is also a partfulfilment of the national guidelines of antimicrobial stewardship for hospitals in Ireland.\n\nObjectives: To achieve this aim, the following have been carried out: (1) a national survey on the opinions of pharmacists on data collecting for antimicrobial consumption in hospitals, (2) development of an antimicrobial consumption database (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) , expressed in DDD/100 bed-days, for hospital-wide and individual group of speciality wards/units, (3) evaluation of the antimicrobial consumption trends obtained from the database.\n\nThe original data presented in 'unit dose' is obtained from the Hospital's information database called the Diver Solution TM , which can interface with Microsoft \u00ae Excel 2007. The aggregate in-hospital consumption data that includes both issues from and returns to pharmacy from 2005 to 2008 were collected. The ABC Calc. (version 3.1, 2006) was adapted in an Excel worksheet to create the antimicrobial consumption database, converting consumption data from 'unit-dose' to DDD/100 bed-days.\n\nThe survey found a variation in the method of data collecting for antimicrobial consumption among hospitals. The lack of an appropriate pharmacy information technology and inadequate education and training on antimicrobial consumption data collection and reporting are some of the main issues of concern. Results from the evaluation of the consumption trends demonstrate the need to monitor hospital-wide and individual speciality wards/units separately. Limitations of the ATC/DDD system have been identified and taken into consideration when interpreting the results. Conclusion: Variation exists in the methods of collecting and reporting for antimicrobial consumption. The study has shown that setting up of antimicrobial consumption databases expressed in DDD/100 beddays can be done at a local level. An antimicrobial consumption database should be available in all hospitals to facilitate the close monitoring of antimicrobial consumption, frequent feedback reporting to the prescribers and also to supplement the surveillance of microbial resistance. Results: Out of a total of 5,733 patients antibiotics were prescribed in 3,732 (66.3%). These prescriptions contained 1\u22123 antibiotics, with a mean of 1.28 antibiotics per prescription. Indications were respiratory tract infections (32.2%), vaginal discharge (26.3%), urinary tract infections (16.3%), skin and soft tissue infections (15%), diarrhoea (9.2%) and prophylaxis (1%). Quinolones were the commonest group prescribed. Antibiotic prescribing was 37% less in academic hospital (P < 0.001). Prescribing peaked in rainy season with 70% of patients prescribed antibiotics. The independent predictors of antibiotic prescribing were seasons (2nd winter > 1st winter), facility (for profit > academic), age groups (adults > children), education level (illiterate > more educated), productive cough at presentation, ear discharge, pneumonia and dysentery. The number of patients per diagnosis, prescription rate with commonest prescribed antibiotic group with DDDs/ TPD per group is shown in table. Conclusions: Statistically significant association between antibiotic prescribing and seasons, for profit hospital, age groups, education level, symptom of productive cough at presentation, ear discharge, pneumonia and dysentery was found. High use of quinolones is a cause of concern.\n\nO477 Systemic antifungal therapy in European hospitals. . Dual therapy was used in 487 (37%) patients, and triple therapy in 24% of patients. The most commonly prescribed antifungal was fluconazole, accounting for 60% of all antifungal therapy followed by caspofungin (10%). The most frequently used antifungal-antibacterial combinations included fluconazole plus either a quinolone or a b-lactam, mainly for medical prophylaxis. The proportion of parenteral use within the total antimycotic prescriptions was 47%. The oral route accounted for 60% of fluconazole prescriptions. In 38% of cases the site of infection was undefined whilst the most common sites were respiratory (20%), gastro-intestinal (16%) and ENT (4%). The medical specialty accounted for the majority (69%) of antifungal use. Hospital acquired infections represented 46% of all the indications followed by medical prophylaxis at 30%. Conclusion: These ESAC-PPS results showed minimal variation in treatment for fungal infections. This was mainly observed in the predominance of fluconazole. However, high use of fluconazole can increase the prevalence of other fungi, e.g., Candida glabrata, and therefore increase the need for newer antifungals which are active against inherently resistant pathogens. Ongoing surveillance will enhance efforts to limit the extent of antifungal use and resistance. Antifungal prophylaxis in the immunocompromised host needs further exploration. ESAC-PPS methodology is the right tool for such analysis. ) and piperacillin-tazobactam (8 vs. 10%), but clearly higher for imipenem (21 vs. 5%) and perhaps also ciprofloxacin (24 vs. 14%, but with many MICs close to the breakpoint). Conclusion: Resistance rates in hospital-acquired lower respiratory isolates are broadly similar to those in bacteraemia, but may differ substantially in some cases. More data and analysis are needed to clarify the influence of factors such as patient age and treating speciality on these apparent differences in resistance between respiratory and blood isolates. Direct surveillance of resistance in specific infections is preferable to extrapolation from data obtained in bacteraemia, when possible.\n\nA. Friaes\u00b0, M. Ramirez, J. Melo-Cristino (Lisbon, PT) Objectives: Although S. pyogenes is universally susceptible to penicillin, in the treatment of complicated Group A Streptococci (GAS) infections such as necrotizing fasciitis or STSS, the association of penicillin with clindamycin has been advocated. Resistance to the latter has been described in GAS, associated with resistance to macrolides. The aim of this work was to evaluate the resistance of GAS invasive isolates to several antimicrobial agents and to further characterize the macrolide resistance isolates. Methods: A total of 306 invasive GAS isolates recovered in Portugal during 2000-2008 were tested for susceptibility to penicillin, vancomycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, levofloxacin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, and linezolid by disk diffusion. Intermediate susceptibilities were confirmed by MIC determination using E-test strips. Resistance genotypes were determined by PCR. Results: All the 306 GAS isolates were susceptible to penicillin, vancomycin, chloramphenicol, quinupristin-dalfopristin, and linezolid, and only two (0.7%) presented reduced susceptibility to levofloxacin (MIC = 3 and 4 ug/ml). A total of 32 isolates (10.5%) were resistant to erythromycin. Of these, 20 were also constitutively resistant to clindamycin (cMLSB phenotype, 62.5%), whereas 12 presented the M phenotype (37.5%). The cMLSB phenotype was associated with the presence of the erm(B) gene, whereas the M phenotype was associated with mef(A). Non-susceptibility to tetracycline was found in 42 isolates (13.7%), of which 8 also expressed the cMLSB phenotype and 1 the M phenotype. Conclusion: Erythromycin resistance among invasive GAS isolates in Portugal did not vary significantly during 2000-2008, contrarily to what has been reported for isolates causing pharyngitis, whose macrolide resistance decreased from 1999 to 2006. The macrolide resistance observed in this study for invasive GAS isolates (10.5%) is in line with reports from other countries, as well as with the overall rate reported for pharyngitis isolates in Portugal during 2004-2006 (13.2%) .\n\nObjectives: There is continued concern that ertapenem (E) will negatively effect imipenem (I) susceptibility to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). Our purpose is to monitor E effect on (I) susceptibility to PA from 2003-2008. Other antipseudomonals on the formulary, piperacillin/ tazobactam (P/T), cefepime (C), and tobramycin (T), were also examined. has not only proportionally expanded but also replaced HA-MRSA. These changes occurred principally among abscess and wound isolates, children and young adults, but with a lesser degree also among other isolate sources and age groups. Four out of five isolates in the outpatient setting now possess the CA-MRSA phenotype. These findings may have preventive and therapeutic implications in the management of S. aureus infections.\n\nO. Lutro\u00b0, H. Langvatn, J. Schrama, G. Hallan, H. Dale, B. Espehaug, H. Sjursen, L. Engesaeter (Bergen, NO) Objectives: Antibiotic prophylaxis is commonly used during prosthesis surgery both systemically and locally in cement. We have examined bacterial findings from specimens taken during revision due to deep infection reported to the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register (NAR). Susceptibility to aminoglycosides (gentamicin, tobramycin and netilmicin) and blactamase-stable penicillins (meticillin, oxacillin and cloxacillin (the methicillin-group) is presented. These antibiotics are the most commonly used in prophylaxis and in treatment of prosthetic joint infections (PJI). Methods: We collected bacterial findings from operations reported as revisions for infection to NAR. The information was collected from notes from the ten hospitals in Norway that reported most revisions for infection from 1987 to 2007. In this period 730 revisions were reported to NAR from these ten hospitals. The total number of reported revisions was 1443 from all Norwegian hospitals. In this study we included operations with one or more positive sample. The bacteria were tested against different antibiotics at different hospitals and in different time periods. We used the c 2 test for linear trend to evaluate changes in distribution of sensitive, intermediate and resistant (S, I, R) bacteria over time. We excluded the first five-year period due to low number of cases compared to the latter three five-year periods (5 vs. 31, 38 and 70, respectively).\n\nThe most frequent bacteria isolated were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (37%), and S. aureus (SA) (17%). Overall 153 operations with CoNS and 74 with SA were found. Among CoNS 53% of the bacteria were resistant to aminoglycosides. The proportion of resistance increased from 35% in 1993-1997 to 43% in 1998-2002, and to 55% in 2003-2007 (p = 0.1) . The overall resistance of CoNS to the meticillin-group (MRSE) was 62%. We found that 45% were MRSE in 1993 -1997 . The proportion increased to 50% in 1998 -2002 and to 76% in 2003 -2007 Objectives: Clostridium difficile infection is the leading cause of nosocomial diarrhea. The emergence and spread of resistance in C. difficile are complicating the treatment and prevention. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and resistance mechanisms of Chinese C. difficile strains.\n\nMethods: 110 toxigenic C. difficile isolates collected between December 2008 and May 2009 at Fudan University Hospital Huashan were analyzed for their antibiotic susceptibility patterns using the agar dilution method. The heteroresistance to metronidazole in fresh isolates were detected by disc diffusion and Etest methods. Resistance molecular basis was investigated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. Results: 16 different PCR ribotypes were identified with a dominant clone 017 accounting for 37.3% of the isolates, followed by 001 and H. Ribotype 027 was not found but one isolate belonged to ribotype 078. All the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. However, 18 of 78 (23.1%) isolates were found to be transient heteroresistant to metronidazole. Resistance to moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, rifampin, rifaximin and fusidic acid was found in 61.8%, 100%, 66.4%, 85.3%, 88.1%, 62.7%, 29.1%, 29.1% and 8.2% of the isolates, respectively. The isolates of common PCR ribotypes were more resistant than the uncommon ribotypes. The prevalence of resistance genes and mutations among the resistant isolates was as follows: ermB, 69.1%; tetM, 97.1%; gyrA mutation, 63.2%; gyrB mutation, 4.4%; gyrA and gyrB mutation, 32.4%, rpoB mutation, 100%, respectively. The fusA mutation was only found in one isolate with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4 mg/L. The genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae comprises about 70 different virus species, many of which are arthropod-borne and transmitted to their vertebrate hosts by mosquitoes or ticks. Among those, the most important human pathogens are yellow fever virus, dengue viruses types 1 to 4, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus and tick-borne encephalitis virus. Depending on specific and different natural host systems, these viruses differ with respect to their areas of geographical distribution but \u2212 at least in some instances \u2212 have the potential to emerge as new pathogens in previously non-endemic regions. Flaviviruses are positive-stranded RNA viruses that have a lipid envelope and only three structural proteins, designated C (capsid), M (membrane) and E (envelope). Non-infectious, immature particles \u2212 containing a precursor of the M protein (prM) \u2212 are formed intracellularly and the proteolytic cleavage of prM by the cellular protease furin generates mature and infectious virions shortly before their release from infected cells. With respect to their structure, flaviviruses are among the best-studied enveloped viruses. The atomic structures of E proteins of several flaviviruses have been determined using X-ray crystallography, and the architectures of both immature and mature virions are known from cryo-electron microscopic studies. Through the combination of structural and immunological investigations, we have gained a detailed understanding of the effects of antibody-binding to the virus and its different antigens. This includes the definition of virus neutralization and antibody-mediated enhancement (ADE) of infectivity at a molecular level. The latter phenomenon has been proposed to play an important role in the immunopathology of severe forms of dengue virus infections (hemorrhagic dengue fever and dengue shock syndrome) in the course of sequential infections with different dengue serotypes. All of these structural insights have also shed new light on the different degrees of cross-reactivity between flaviviruses, including the existence of cryptic epitopes that are recognized by broadly flavivirus cross-reactive Nocardia infections S109 antibodies without leading to neutralization. The current picture of antibody interactions with flaviviruses will be presented in the context of their biological significance. Treatment of invasive aspergillosis: pharmacokinetics vs. resistance S496 Clinical impact of azole resistance P. Verweij\u00b0 (Nijmegen, NL) The class of the azoles have become the most prominent class of compounds for the management of invasive aspergillosis. The clinically licensed triazoles with activity against Aspergillus include itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole. The azoles are also the only drugs that can be administered orally. The azoles interact with the biosynthesis of ergosterol, which is an important component of the fungal cell membrane. Intrinsic resistance to azoles has been documented for A. calidoustus, but the vast majority of species are susceptible in vitro.\n\nRecently, Aspergillus species with acquired resistance to azoles have been reported, especially in A. fumigatus. It appears that resistance may develop during azole therapy, especially in patients with chronic therapy including patients with chronic infection and aspergilloma. Another route of resistance development may be exposure of Aspergillus to azole fungicides that are used in our environment. Patients would then inhale azole-resistant conidia and develop azole-resistant aspergillosis. The consequence of this route of transmission is that azole-resistant disease may occur in patients without previous exposure to azole compounds. Azole resistance is commonly due to mutations in the Cyp51A-gene and is associated with different phenotypes. Isolates may be resistant to a single azole compound, but more commonly a cross-resistant phenotype is observed. Several cases of azole-resistant aspergillosis have been reported and commonly these patients failed to respond to azole therapy. Azole-resistant A. fumigatus isolates remain virulent and are capable of causing invasive disease in patients at risk. The efficacy of azole compounds against azole-resistant isolates, with different resistance mechanisms, has been investigated in experimental models of invasive aspergillosis. These indicate that the minimal inhibitory concentration has major impact on the efficacy of the azole. Elevated MICs are associated with loss of efficacy of the azole compounds in vivo. The use of azoles should be avoided in patients with azole-resistant aspergillosis, if possible. Alternative agents such as lipid-formulations of amphotericin B or caspofungin appear to retain their efficacy against azole-resistant isolates. A significant problem is the early diagnosis of azole-resistance as in the majority of cases an isolate is not obtained and, if an isolate is cultured, in vitro susceptibility testing causes delay in treatment with effective agents.\n\nInfectious diseases in our time pose a tremendous challenge to the medical community. We are confronted with emerging infectious diseases, increasing antimicrobial resistance, stagnant development of new antibiotics, poor quality of antimicrobial prescribing, poor compliance with hospital hygiene, a revolution in microbiology, increasing numbers of immuno-compromised and frail patients, and upcoming immunotherapeutic possibilities. To cope with these problems in a successful way, synergy between clinical microbiologists and clinicians with infectious disease expertise is needed more than ever. In my view, the profile of the ideal microbiologist is that of a welltrained physician who received a specialty training which encompasses laboratory skills (microbiology, molecular biology), practical training in clinical infectious diseases, epidemiology and public health, hygiene, research and communication.\n\nIn the ideal setting, there is close partnership with the ID physicians and there is complementarity, optimal collaboration, mutual recognition and trust. In daily practice, however, obstacles may be encountered, such as competence, mistrust, ego and other psychological factors, finances, time and organizational constraints. Such hurdles should be recognized and dealt with.\n\nThe nature of infectious diseases (ID) has changed significantly over the past decades. Many ID have successfully been eradicated through vaccination and the course of some infections has changed due to improved standard of life. On the other hand, changes in life style and longer life expectancy have promoted the emergence and spread of new ID. In spite of rigorous attempts to control hospital care associated infections these infections are becoming a growing problem in modern medicine. The appearance of multiply resistant organisms and the shortage of new antibiotics in the pipeline have placed further demands on developing expertise in the difficult field of antibiotic stewardship. Therefore, the profession of an ID doctor in the 21st century is a very complex one. He or she should have good skills and knowledge in recognizing traditional infectious diseases even those that are believed to be eradicated or not frequent in the area of practice. However, over the past decades infectious diseases with typical clinical presentation and a well defined pathogen have been to a significant extent replaced by infections whose symptoms overlap with the symptoms of the underlying diseases in the same patient or can not be easily differentiated from other causes of systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Therefore an ID doctor has to have good communication skills in dealing with other colleagues of different specialties and should be used to work in a team, appreciating different skills brought by different disciplines. From a clinical microbiologist point of view an ideal infectious disease specialist should recognize that the field of clinical microbiology (CM) has undergone the same transformation from mostly research and public health oriented microbiology towards microbiology at the patient bedside. In many patients only individual approach and team work will produce satisfactory diagnosis and treatment of infection. The fact that skills and competencies of modern ID and CM doctors overlap to a greater extent than with other specialties makes a solid ground for a close collaboration and partnership between these two professions. This is important in the field of clinical practice as well as in the field of research. There is a growing number of literature related to infectious diseases and anyone involved in the management of such patients should have a basic knowledge in research methodology and be competent in practicing evidence based medicine.\n\nNocardiosis is an uncommon bacterial infection with a wide variety of clinical manifestations in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. The number of cases reported in the literature is increasing. This might be due to an absolute increase in the number of immunocompromised patients but also to improvement in laboratory techniques to detect nocardiosis. Host resistance to nocardial infection depends on neutrophils in early lesions and then the cell-mediated immune response. The most common predisposing factors to opportunistic nocardia infections are long-term steroid usage, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, neoplastic disease, and human immunodeficiency virus infection. Clinical manifestations of nocardiosis range from cutaneous infections caused by traumatic inoculation in normal hosts to severe pulmonary and central nervous system diseases in immunocompromised hosts. The genus of Nocardia is rapidly expanding and the species distribution varies with different geographical locations. Previous studies also emphasized the importance of determining the species of Nocardia, because different species and isolates vary in their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. Sulphonamides have been used in the treatment of nocardiosis since the 1940s and are still the drugs of choice and the most common antimicrobials used to treat these infections. Sulphonamide monotherapy, however, was associated with mortality rates of almost 50% for patients with central venous system (CNS) nocardial infections. In addition, patients with non-CNS infections who had overwhelming or disseminated disease had a high mortality rate when treated with sulphonamides alone. However, currently available therapeutic alternatives are scarce and only comprise amoxicillin/clavulanate, carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem) and amikacin. Resistance to previously administered drugs, the toxicity and intolerance of the antimicrobials and even therapeutic failure necessitate the search for alternative agents.\n\nResults from in vitro studies suggest that nemonoxacin (TG-873870), a non-fluorinated quinolone, linezolid and tigecycline show promise as alternatives for the treatment of nocardiosis. Further clinical trials are needed to clarify their role in the treatment of these infections.\n\nO501 Efficacy and safety of oseltamivir-zanamivir combination compared to each monotherapy for seasonal influenza: a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial Objective: Several studies provide evidence that neuraminidase inhibitors can reduce the duration of influenza symptoms. Yet, data regarding their effectiveness in reducing influenza complications are scarce. Methods: We evaluated the effectiveness of neuraminidase inhibitors in reducing influenza complications and mortality of patients with seasonal influenza, by performing a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) retrieved from PubMed, Cochrane and Scopus databases, comparing neuraminidase inhibitors with placebo. Results: Eleven RCTs (10 double-blinded. 1 with an open-label design) were included; 8 involved adults and adolescents. In total, 5315 patients were included; 3491 (65.7%) with confirmed infection. Total influenzarelated complications occurred significantly less likely in otherwise healthy patients with confirmed infection treated with antivirals versus placebo [7 RCTs, 2621 patients, OR (odds ratio)=0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.58-0.87]. This finding was more pronounced in highrisk patients (4 RCTs, 475 patients, OR = 0.26, 95% CI=0.15-0.47), compared with otherwise healthy patients (p < 0.01). In the comparisons regarding other respiratory complications, a trend in favour of antivirals was observed. Regarding acute otitis media specifically, a significant difference was observed. Significantly fewer antibiotics were also administered in patients with confirmed infection treated with antivirals versus placebo (6 RCTs, 1921 patients, OR = 0.77, 95% CI=0.62-0.96). No differences were found in the comparisons regarding the safety outcomes of our meta-analysis. Mortality data were scarcely reported. No deaths were reported in the respective trials. Conclusions: Neuraminidase inhibitors appear to be effective in reducing total influenza-related complications both in otherwise healthy with confirmed infection and high-risk patients. They also reduce additional antibiotic consumption. ; solid tumors, 6 (25%); lymphoma, 6 (25%); multiple myeloma, 3 (12%) and chronic leukemia, 2 (8%). All patients had fever and acute respiratory symptoms. Previous chemotherapy (79%), neutropenia (50%) and history of steroids therapy (37%) were commonly present. No patients had laboratory-documented bacterial infections at the illness onset, however all received antibacterial agents at presentation. Seventeen patients developed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and severe hypoxemia was present in 15 cases (88.2%). Of these, 11 underwent mechanical ventilation. Twenty-two patients were treated with oseltamivir and, in 37.5% of them a double dose was prescribed. Median time from admission to antiviral therapy start was 5 days (range: 0\u221220 days). Antiviral therapy was started within 48 h of symptoms in only 10 patients (22%). Main reasons for therapy delay were the lack of specificity symptoms in neutropenic patients and the initial difficulty to obtain antiviral drugs. Five patients died (21%), and two of them never received oseltamivir. In the other 3 cases, the therapy was only started 8, 9 and 15 days after hospital admission.\n\nThis study presents a series of cancer patients with H1N1 virus infection with an elevated mortality. We observed a high number of cases in young patients. Considering the clinical data, a nosocomial transmission cannot be ruled-out. Our data shows a possible association of mortality with a lack or a delay of antiviral therapy initiation. A faster availability of antiviral medication for therapy and prophylaxis and vaccination programs should be reinforced among cancer patients, close contacts and healthcare workers. O508 Impact of antiseptic based oral care on rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia in intensive care unit patients: a meta-analysis K. Van de Vyver, S. Labeau, N. Brusselaers, D. Vogelaers, S. Blot\u00b0( Ghent, BE) Objective: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most frequent nosocomial infection in the intensive care unit. Reducing inoculums of oral pathogenic microorganisms by adequate oral care could prevent VAP. Methods: A systematic review of the literature concerning oral decontamination with chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine on intubated patients, and subsequent meta-analysis evaluating the effects of oral decontamination on the incidence of VAP was performed. Relevant articles were searched for in electronic databases as PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science and CENTRAL and supplemented by manual searches of reference lists. Only randomized controlled trials evaluating the effect of oral care with use of chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine vs. oral care without use of an antiseptic on the incidence of VAP in adult intubated patients were included. Data were extracted as dichotomous variables. Data analysis was performed using RevMan 5.0. Statistical analysis was conducted according the Mantel-Haenszel model to obtain the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed using the Chi-2 test. Results: Eleven studies were included in the analysis (n patients = 1971) of which 9 that investigated the effect of oral care with use of chlorhexidine (n patients = 1862) and 2 that assessed the effect of oral care with use of povidone-iodine (n patients = 109). The use of an antisepticum resulted in a significant reduction of the incidence of VAP with a RR of 0.63 (95% CI 0.50-0.81; p = 0.0002). These results are valid for chlorhexidine (RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.53-0.88; p = 0.004) and povidone-iodine (RR 0.38; 95% CI 0.19-0.75; p = 0.005). Among studies important differences exists concerning concentrations of the antiseptic used, frequency of oral care, and study methodology and diagnostic criteria for VAP. Clinical heterogeneity was confirmed statistically and was moderate (c 2 = 43%; p = 0.08) for the trials using chlorhexidine and high (c 2 = 66%; p = 0.09) for those assessing povidone-iodine. Subgroup analyses revealed most beneficial effects with concentrations of 0.12% and 2% chlorhexidine and 10% povidone-iodine, and in a population of cardiac surgery patients.\n\nConclusions: This analysis shows that oral decontamination with an antiseptic reduces the incidence of VAP significantly. Both chlorhexidine and povidone-iodine show this effect. However, further research is needed to make recommendations about the concentration and frequency of application. were treated with Panobacumab. Thirteen patients (completers) received 3 infusions and 4 patients (non-completers) received 1 infusion. The study drug was safe and well tolerated. Panobacumab revealed a pharmacokinetic profile similar to a native IgM. Panobacumab could be detected in BAL samples collected after treatment indicating the antibody to reach the inflamed lung tissue. Clinically the initial mean CPIS and APACHEII score were 8.53 (7\u221211) and 18.2 (6\u221233) with an expected mortality of 29.6%. The overall observed mortality within 30 days after starting treatment was 17.6%. Despite an APACHEII score of 18.5 and expected mortality of 30.6% all completers survived within the first 30 days while non-completers showed a survival rate of 25%. Resolution of pneumonia was achieved by 9 out of 13 completers in 9.9\u00b14.3 days (mean\u00b1SD) including two patients which were initially inadequately treated. An early administration of the antibody seems to correlate positively with the resolution of pneumonia. The mean Cmax after the third dose of Panobacumab was higher in patients with resolution than in those with continuation of pneumonia ( (1\u221230) and 12 days (6\u221218), respectively. Overall clinical cure and microbiological eradication was 76.1% and 86.4%, respectively. The median dose of HD DAP for RIE vs. LIE were 9.7 mg/kg/day (8.0-11.4) vs. 9.9 mg/kg/day (8.0-12.1), respectively. Safety: 87% patients had Objectives: Osteomyelitis (OM) is a complicated and diverse disease and long term efficacy and safety of an antibiotic is an important determinant in selecting the optimal therapy. This is the first report of a large series of OM cases treated with daptomycin (DAP) across many countries in Europe. Methods: Data were collected as part of the European CUBICIN \u00ae Outcomes Registry and Experience (EU-CORE) program, a retrospective, non-interventional, observational, multicenter study designed to describe the clinical use of DAP. All patients (pts) who had a diagnosis of OM were selected from the database. Pts who were treated with at least one dose of DAP and for whom any safety parameter was assessed were included in safety population. Efficacy population was a subset of the safety population where clinical outcome (cure, improved, failure, or non-evaluable) was assessed by the investigators. Pts enrolled from Jan 2006 to Aug 2009 were included. Results: Of 2581 pts enrolled 161 (58.4% male, 42% 65 years) were diagnosed with OM. 90 (56%) cases of OM were non-prosthetic device related, 50 (31%) were permanent prosthetic device related, 21 (13%) were temporary prosthetic device related. For 103 pts (64%) primary pathogens have been reported. S. aureus (45/103) was the most frequent species, with MRSA (n = 19) as significant subset. Coagulase-negative Staphylococci (41/103) ranked second. Most pts received DAP doses 6 mg/kg (76%). Median duration of DAP outpt therapy was 29 days (range: 4\u221282), and inpt therapy was 14 (range: 1-246). Overall clinical success (cured or improved) was seen in 73% (118/161) of pts and failure in 9% (14/161). 18% of pts were non-evaluable (29/161). In subgroup analyses, clinical success was observed in 72% (65/90) of pts without devices, 72% (36/50) of pts with permanent devices and 81% (17/21) of pts with temporary prosthetic devices. Serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values were reported in 68% (109/161) of pts during DAP therapy. In 86% of pts (94/109) CPK levels remained within normal range. Discontinuation of DAP due to treatment failure was reported for 2 pts (1%) only. Serious AEs were reported in 3% (5/161) of pts. AEs leading to study drug discontinuation were reported in 5% (8/161). Conclusion: DAP at doses 6 mg/kg once daily was the most frequent dose regimen used for osteomyelitis in Europe. DAP was well-tolerated also for longer treatment duration. These promising results warrant confirmation in additional studies. Objective: Treatment recommendations for invasive enterococcal infections advocate synergistic combinations such as ampicillin plus gentamicin. In case of resistance to one or even both of the drugs, vancomycin therapy is proposed, albeit it is poorly bactericidal. The Swiss surveillance program reports resistance of Enterococcus faecium to aminopenicillin and high-level gentamicin to be as high as 82% and 49%, respectively (www.anresis.ch). This leaves the clinician with a therapeutic conundrum since no established therapeutic regimen exists. Daptomycin is approved for complicated skin and soft tissue infections with Gram-positive bacteria and showed efficacy against E. faecium in the experimental endocarditis model. Methods: We report a case series of 11 patients with severe E. faecium infections treated with daptomycin at the University Hospital Basel between 2007 and 2009. All strains were resistant to ampicillin (MIC > 8 mg/l), but susceptible to vancomycin. 7/11 strains were also highly resistant to gentamicin (MIC > 500 mg/l). Results: All patients were treated with multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics prior to isolation of E. faecium and had severe underlying diseases: Five had haematological malignancies, two had repeated episodes of cholangiosepsis, two suffered from severe atherosclerosis after multiple vascular surgical procedures, one had undergone liver transplantation and one had colon cancer. Foci were mainly blood stream infections or cholangitis. The reasons for daptomycin treatment were renal failure (n = 3), vancomycin failure (n = 4) despite vancomycin susceptibility (MIC 4 mg/l), outpatient parenteral therapy (n = 2) and uncontrolled infection (n = 2). With one isolate from a patient with persistent bacteremia, in vitro killcurves were performed, showing a bactericidal effect of daptomycin (loss of >3 log/CFU/24 h with 2 mg/l and 10 mg/l of the drug). In contrast, 10 mg/l of vancomycin was bacteriostatic. Daptomycin was used in a dose of 6 mg/kg/d. 7 patients recovered, 4 patients died. Death was related to uncontrollable infection in only one case, the other deaths were attributable to the underlying diseases. Conclusion: Our case series suggests that salvage therapy with daptomycin was likely to be efficient in 7/11 patients with refractory invasive infections due to multi-resistant E. faecium. Thus, daptomycin might be a safe option in such cases. Objective: Outbreaks of pandrug-resistant (PDR) Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) have emerged in Singapore. Combination therapy is often the remaining viable option until new antibiotics are available. While polymyxin B (P) may remain a viable treatment option, heteroresistance has become a major problem. We evaluate the efficacy of P, rifampicin (R) and tigecycline (T) combined against PDR AB isolated from our local hospitals. Methods: PDR AB isolates from all public hospitals in Singapore were collected from 2006\u221207. MICs were determined according to a modified CLSI broth-dilution method. Time-kill studies (TKS) were then performed with the maximum, clinically achievable, unbound concentration (mg/L) of P (2), R (2) and T (2) alone and in combination against the PDR AB isolates. A hollow-fiber infection model (HFIM) was used to validate our quantitative assessment of combined killing against 2 isolates (selected based on the unique genotype that represents the PDR AB population). Resistance selection of the 2 isolates against P alone in the HFIM were quantified using drug-free and selective (P at 3x MIC) media. Results: Among 361 non-repeat AB isolates screened, 29 PDR AB isolates found were susceptible to P (MICs 1\u22122 mg/L) and resistant to all antibiotic classes whereas R MICs ranged from 2\u221216 mg/L. In TKS, P, R and T alone was bacteriostatic with regrowth by 24 h in all isolates. P+R, P+T and R+T achieved >99% kill from baseline in 15/29, 14/29 and 8/29 isolates with no regrowth at 24 h. These assessments were consistent with observation in HFIM studies where we observe bacterial killing up to 120 h with P+R. Pharmacokinetic validation of the HFIM studies were satisfactory. Minimal killing of the 2 isolates was seen when exposed to P alone. Regrowth was seen at 24 h due to selective amplication of resistant sub-population(s) on P supplemented plates. Repeat MIC testing of the resistant isolates confirms P resistance (MICs 32-128 mg/L). Conclusions: We have shown that our PDR AB has the propensity to exhibit heteroresistance and combination therapy with P is needed. P+R may be a potential antibiotic combination as therapy for PDR AB infections. The in vivo relevance of our results warrants further investigations. As no data is available about antibiotic activity against intracellular P.a., we have developed a 24-h infection model using THP-1 cells, a human cell line known to be permissive for infection by several important human pathogens. This model has now been used to test for the activity of 4 antibiotics representative of 4 classes of drugs used in clinics to treat pseudomonal infections. Methods: Phagocytosis of bacteria (opsonized with human serum) was allowed for 2 h (bacteria/macrophage ratio: 10), extracellular bacteria were eliminated by washing and incubation for 60 min with gentamicin at 50 x MIC, and Infected cells (5\u22127\u00d710 5 CFU/mg cell prot.) incubated with antibiotics (0.01 to 100 \u00d7 MIC). Activity against bacteria in broth (1\u00d710 6 CFU/ml) was determined in parallel (same conc. span). Activity was expressed as change from the initial inoculum after 24 h, and the data used for fitting a concentration-response curve (Hill equation) and for calculation of the Emax and Cstatic pharmacodynamic parameters (AAC 2006; 50: 841\u221251) .\n\nThe table shows that while TOB and DOR were cidal in broth (Emax \u2248 \u22123 log CFU), their intracellular maximal efficacy was markedly reduced (less negative Emax) towards intracell. Pa. LVX was also affected but to a lesser extent. CST, bacteriostatic against extracell. bacteria, also showed decreased intracellular efficacy. In addition, CST and TOB showed a 6 to 9 fold decrease of relative potency (higher Cstatic) when comparing intracell. and extracell. bacteria. Conclusions: The model shows that, as for other intracell. bacteria, antibiotics are considerably less active and, for 2 classes, less potent, against intracellular forms compared to bacteria in broth, irrespective of their mode of action. This may contribute to the difficulty of eradicating P. aeruginosa in vivo. Objectives: To develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model for delafloxacin (DFX) and use that model to estimate pharmacokineticpharmacodynamic (PK-PD) indices in Phase 2 patients treated for complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI). Methods: Data from 3 Phase 1 studies (1 single dose, two multiple dose) and 1 Phase 2, cSSSI study were pooled to develop a population pharmacokinetic model. All doses were administered by IV infusion; doses ranged from 50 to 600 mg. The Phase 2 study employed doses of 300 or 450 mg BID. Intensive PK sampling was employed in all Phase 1 studies while Phase 2 patients contributed 4\u22125 samples at steady-state over one dosing interval. Population PK modeling was performed using Monte Carlo Parametric Expectation Maximization as implemented in S-ADAPT 1.5.6. Two and 3 compartment models were explored using linear and/or nonlinear elimination. Steady-state AUC and Cmax estimates were calculated using individual PK parameter estimates for Phase 2 patients and indexed to observed pathogen MICs to calculate PK-PD indices. Previous animal studies have indicated that free-drug AUC:MIC ratios (fAUC:MIC) of 9.3 and 14.3 are associated with net bacterial stasis and 1-log10 CFU reduction, respectively, for Staphylococcus aureus. Results: The final analysis dataset included 103 subjects (86 from Phase 1, 17 from Phase 2) and 2273 plasma concentrations. A 2 compartment model with a mix of linear and nonlinear elimination provided the most robust fit to the data (r 2 = 0.965, observed=1.02*fitted \u2212 0.032). All parameters were estimated with excellent precision; interindividual variability in the parameters that define clearance (linear clearance, intrinsic clearance, and Michaelis-Menten constant) ranged from 24\u221270%. Twelve patients had requisite MIC data to calculate a PK-PD index, all fAUCss:MIC estimates were above 100 (range: 108-3754); all 12 patients were classified as clinical and microbiological cures. The median (min \u2212 max) fCmax:MIC ratio was 191 (18.8-565). Seven patients had MRSA as their primary pathogen; MIC values were universally low (0.004-0.06).\n\nConclusions: Development of a population PK model allowed for the estimation of drug exposure in a Phase 2 cSSSI study using relatively sparse PK sampling. Based on PK-PD indices from the Phase 2 study, 300 and 450 mg (BID) clinical doses were appropriate for the treatment of cSSSI. Results also support coverage of MIC values up to 1.0 mcg/mL. O520 Pharmacokinetics and penetration of ciprofloxacin into bronchial secretions of critically ill patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease P. Kontou\u00b0, K. Chatzika, G. Pitsiou, A. Boutou, P. Argyropoulou, I. Kioumis (Thessaloniki, GR) Objective: Ciprofloxacin (CIP) is one of the antibiotics of choice for the treatment of severe exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Antibiotic penetration into the site of infection is critical for obtaining an optimal clinical outcome. Since in COPD patients the infection develops within the airway lumen, it is important to know the drug concentrations that are achieved in bronchial secretions (BS). The purpose of this study was to evaluate CIP's pharmacokinetic (PK) profile in plasma and penetration into BS of mechanically ventilated COPD patients, when administered at the currently recommended dose of 1200 mg per day. Methods: Ninenteen critically ill COPD patients received a 1-hour infusion of 400 mg CIP q8 h. They all had a respiratory infection as well as risk factors for Ps. aeruginosa and they were intubated. Serial blood and BS samples were obtained at steady state. Concentrations were determined by a validated HPLC assay. Penetration ratio was calculated by dividing the 24 h area under the curve (AUC 0\u221224 ) of BS by the AUC 0\u221224 of plasma. The pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters for CIP were also calculated. Results: Mean\u00b1SD values for volume of distribution, clearance, halflife and AUC 0\u219224 were 174.31\u00b185.42 L, 27.32\u00b19.53 L/h, 5.5\u00b12.34 h and 47.58\u00b118.07, respectively. The mean peak (C max ) and trough levels in plasma were 5.32\u00b11.76 and 1.05\u00b10.59 mg/L respectively. In BS, a mean C max of 3.11\u00b11.27 mg/L was achieved in 3\u00b11.03 hours and the penetration ratio was 1.17\u00b10.61. Thirteen patients demonstrated penetration equal to or even more than 100%. The PD target of AUC 0\u219224 /MIC 125 in plasma, that has been shown to be predictive of efficacy for Gram-negative infections, was attained in all patients and in the majority of them (74%) at MICs of 0.125 and 0.25 mg/ml respectively but in only 3 patients and in none at higher MICs (0.5 and 1 mg/ml). Slightly better results were obtained for the PD threshold of C max /MIC 10. Conclusions: CIP exhibits excellent penetration into BS. There is wide interindividual variability in its PK parameters in critically ill COPD patients and inadequate PD exposure against bacteria with MICs 0.5 mg/ml. Our data confirm the need for combination therapy against pathogens with high MICs such as Ps. aeruginosa, as well as the institution of therapeutic drug monitoring for individualizing antimicrobial dosing in order to optimize the efficacy of antibiotic therapy in the ICU.\n\nThe initial problem or challenge with all infections is to identify the infecting organisms and the focus of the infection. This is usually not a problem for acute infections since the bacteria are readily obtained by swapping or sampling the infected area. For chronic infections it is usually more problematic. An exception is cystic fibrosis (CF) in which the easy accessible purulent sputum coughed up by the patients on a regular basis harbor the bacteria. For the other chronic infections routine sampling has been either using a swab, a scrape or a biopsy, however all might fail to sample the bacteria. In a chronic wound the swab will only collect bacteria on the surface not the bacteria embedded in the wound bed. On the other hand, since the bacteria are very heterogeneously distributed chances are that a biopsy fails to contain any bacteria. Also for implant and catheter related infection diagnosing the bacteria prove difficult. Five to 10 years ago the bacteria on these surfaces and biofilm in general were considered unculturable. Here the problem is surface adherence, the bacteria simply attach extremely well to the surface of the foreign bodies. It is not that they are unculturable, they have to be released from the surface, and vigorously vortexing or even mechanical scraping is not enough. The implant or catheter has to be treated with ultra sound (sonication) to release the bacteria. The problems of diagnosing the bacteria in these chronic infections are far from solved. Today bacteria can be detected by: culturing, PCR, microscopy or diagnostic imaging. Each method has its advantages and limitations. For culturing, the problem is to collect the bacteria, either next to the surface, which is sampled, or from the catheter or implant. PCR will detect even tiny amounts of available DNA or RNA available in the sample. Additionally, just because a bacterium is present does not necessarily indicate that it contributes to the pathogenesis of the infection. Microscopy such as Gram-staining or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) enables direct visualization of the infecting bacteria and the surrounding tissue and inflammatory cells. Again the bacteria need to be present in the collected sample, which means many biopsies need to be analyzed for a correct diagnostics of e.g. a wound. On the other hand if only a few bacteria are present they might be very hard and statistically impossible to observe using traditional staining such as Gram.\n\nStreptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus, GAS) is responsible for a diverse range of clinical manifestations, from mild skin/soft tissue infections and pharyngitis to more serious manifestations, such as bacteremia, cellulitis, puerperal sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia, and necrotizing fasciitis. The drug of choice for streptococcal infections treatment still remains penicillin. In fact, the ability of penicillin and its related antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin) to kill group A streptococci has not changed in more than 50 years and, to date, there has never been a report on a group A streptococcus resistant to this class of antibiotics. On the other hand, macrolide resistance has been showing an increasing trend, with resistance rates which vary considerably in different countries, reaching up to almost 30% in some part of Europe. Effective treatment is of utmost importance, even for streptococcal pharyngitis, as it is primarily aimed at preventing non-suppurative and suppurative complications and decreasing infectivity. Even if not frequently, S. pyogenes infections may fail to respond to antibiotic therapy leading to persistent throat carriage and recurrent infections. Such failures cannot always be explained with the occurrence of antibiotic resistance determinants. It was first suggested that erythromycin-resistant S. pyogenes may escape antimicrobial treatment and the host immune response through invasion of epithelial cells. Later, as GAS have recently been shown to be able to form biofilm, and being such character known to provide organisms with an improved antibiotic resistance besides supporting colonization and persistence, biofilm has been suggested as possibly responsible for unexplained treatment failures and recurrences due to susceptible microorganisms. Preliminary data have shown that biofilm may be produced, and/or upregulated, in S. pyogenes in response to either antibiotic treatment, other therapeutic molecules or environmental stimuli. In particular, subMIC antibiotic concentrations appear to stimulate biofilm formation; such phenomenon is being observed with increasing frequency for a number of microorganisms, both for biofilm and other virulence factors. The latest findings on what it is known on biofilm produced by S. pyogenes, its possible role in the pathogenesis of streptococcal infections, and on the interactions between antibiotics and other therapeutic molecules and streptococcal biofilm, will be examined.\n\nAspergillus fumigatus causes infections in both immunocompromised hosts and patients with chronic lung infections. The initial establishment of A. fumigatus infections involves the germination of conidia and subsequent hyphal invasion of the lung tissues. Histology and microscopic examination of bronchopulmonary lavage samples reveals the presence of numerous A. fumigatus hyphae in the form of a complex mesh like structure, similar to other fungal biofilms.\n\nWe have developed an in vitro model of an Aspergilus fumigatus biofilm. This model possesses the classical elements of biofilm growth, namely multicellularity, matrix production and sessile resistance and shows has distinct developmental phases both genotypically and phenotypically. I will discuss the in vitro antifungal activity of voriconazole, amphotericin B and caspofungin and how this model may relate to the use of antifungals in the clinic. Also how a better understanding of the biology of Aspergillus fumigatus in vitro may lead to a different approach to diagnosis of invasive fungal infection.\n\nS525 Imaging and microdosing \u2212 how do they fit for antimicrobial agents?\n\nMost drugs exert their effects not within the plasma compartment, but in defined target tissues into which drugs have to distribute from the central compartment. Unfortunately, a complete and lasting equilibration between blood and tissue cannot always be taken for granted. Drug distribution processes may be characterized by a high intertissue-and intersubject variability and target site drug levels may substantially differ from corresponding plasma levels. Suboptimal target site concentrations may have important clinical implications, as it is a potential explanation for therapeutic failures. In particular for antimicrobial agents knowledge of drug tissue distribution is of primal importance as tissue drug exposure has been shown to be directly related to outcome of therapy. Therefore, determination of drug tissue penetration plays an important role in antimicrobial drug development. Positron emission tomography (PET) is nuclear imaging method, which can be used to study the tissue distribution of drugs labeled with positron-emitting radionuclides, such as carbon-11 or fluorine-18, non-invasively. These types of studies have been termed PET-microdosing studies, as the amount of drug administered in a PET study is usually less than 100 microgram. Due to low administered drug doses, the potential toxicological risk to human subjects is very limited. Consequently regulatory authorities require reduced preclinical safety testing as compared to conventional phase 1 studies. In the present talk, recent applications of PET-microdosing in antimicrobial drug development will be reviewed.\n\nS527 PK modelling: obtaining PK profiles despite sparse sampling\n\nObjectives: Tissue penetration studies pose a significant challenge for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modelling, especially if only one tissue sample can be obtained per patient. We sought to systematically evaluate the ability of various optimized and nonoptimized clinical trial designs to determine the rate and extent of tissue penetration and their between subject variability (BSV).\n\nMonte Carlo simulations with a 2-compartment model were performed in Berkeley Madonna to simulate plasma and tissue concentrations of 1000 patients for intravenous moxifloxacin as an example drug. Simulation scenario A assumed that the tissue concentration is proportional to the concentration in the peripheral compartment. For scenario B, rate and extent of tissue penetration were estimated and tissue volume fixed to a small value. Population optimal sampling times were determined in WinPOPT (V1.2). For 12 sampling schedules, 100 datasets of 48 patients were drawn randomly and analyzed by the MC-PEM algorithm in S-ADAPT V1.56 using the true model (2400 population PK analyses in total). Bias and precision of mean population PK parameters and variances representing BSV were calculated. Results: Except for designs that sampled both plasma and tissue at the same time in all patients, in scenario A bias was <8% and precision <19% for population means and bias was generally <25% and precision <30% for BSV for all PK parameters. For scenario B and designs with 5 optimized plasma sampling times and one tissue sample per patient:\n\n(1) Designs with all tissue samples at the same time showed bias up to 48% for extent of tissue penetration and up to 78% for rate of tissue penetration.\n\n(2) A design with random tissue sampling times had bias <7% and precision <21% for all population means.\n\n(3) A design with four groups (each: n = 12) of patients each sampled at one optimized tissue sampling time achieved bias <3% and precision <13% for all population means and bias <18% and precision <33% for all BSV estimates.\n\nConclusions: Tissue samples should be obtained at multiple optimized time points to determine the rate and extent of penetration, even if only one tissue sample per patient can be obtained. Designs with serial plasma samples at population optimal times were beneficial. Designs with one plasma and one tissue sample per patient all at the same time performed poorly and benefitted from a full Bayesian approach for PK analysis.\n\nThe importance of diligent pharmacokinetic (PK) profiling in the early drug research and development stages to reduce late attrition rate has been increasingly recognized over the last decade and major advances have been made. Based on the results of ADME screening (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) during the lead optimization phase, relevant predictive information on the pharmacokinetic behavior of a preclinical candidate is typically obtained in two or three animal species before administration to humans. The preclinical PK assessment provides the input for in vitro and in vivo PK/PD (pharmacodynamic) models that evaluate exposure-effect relationships. Such PK/PD models are powerful tools for dose selection for the clinical phases of drug development. If phase 1 PK data are available, population based PK/PD models support effectively dose selection for late stage clinical trials. Moreover, a PK/PD guided approach can provide decision support for susceptibility breakpoints as well as strategies to mitigate resistance development. Recent late stage clinical failures illustrate the importance of understanding the impact of PKs such as protein binding and concentrations at infection sites and incorporating them early into adequate PK/PD evaluations.\n\nEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in immune suppressed transplant recipients is a frequent and potential life-threatening complication. EBV causes B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, collectively named PTLD, which may lead to malignant lymphoma if left untreated. The incidence, clinical appearance and severity of PTLD may be quite variable, requiring appropriate risk-stratification at onset and accurate and standardized diagnostic monitoring approaches in the post-transplant period aiming at early identification of EBV involvement and distinction from rejection and other (infectious) complications. The biology and pathogenesis underlying PTLD in solid organ (SOT) and stem cell transplant (SCT) recipients has different features, with implications for diagnosis and treatment. Primary infection in the SOT and nearly all (re)active EBV infections in SCT pose the highest risk for fatal complications. A distinction should be made between early and late-onset PTLD, the former being directly EBV driven and frequently reversible by simple therapeutic intervention. The latter should be seen as a consequence of misdiagnosed early EBV-driven B-cell amplification, allowing additional genetic defects to accumulate, thereby increasing the malignant phenotype, which frequently require more severe intervention strategies, including chemotherapy. Early PTLD can be recognized by dynamic increases of EBV-DNA load in blood over relatively short time intervals. In SOT this EBV load is usually cell associated, whereas in SCT both cell and plasma DNA loads are observed. Whole blood may be a preferred well standardized sample for diagnostic monitoring. Dependent on the type of transplant, therapeutic intervention may vary from a (mild-moderate) reduction of immunosuppressive treatment (IST), via use of Rituximab (rtX) to infusion of ex vivo activated EBV-reactive T-cells. A persistent decrease of EBV-DNA load may be taken as a sign of therapeutic efficacy, and monitoring EBV-reactive T-cells by tetramer FACS or ELISPOT tests may provide information on patient's immune capacity to conquer EBVdriven B-cell proliferation and restore EBV latency on the long term. Treatment failure is indicated by persistent increases of EBV-DNA over time, and should be taken as sign for more drastic intervention. During early PTLD EBV-infected cells frequently disseminate via the circulation, and thus becomes easily detectable, whereas late PTLD may be confined to tissue with little circulating cells. EBV transcription profiling has revealed differences EBV gene expression in biopsy material and circulating EBV-carrying cells in patients with early PTLD, suggesting transcription regulation in affected lymphoid tissues. Furthermore analysis of EBV gene expression in PTLD lesions at the single cell level, reveals heterogeneous EBV gene expression, reflecting more complex underlying pathogenic events rather than simple proliferation of latency-III (growth program) expressing B-cells. Infrequent measuring of EBV DNA loads is not considered a proper diagnostic approach, because mere EBV DNA levels may vary between patients. These generally have no clinical implication when being stable over time. It is suggested that frequent (weekly) measurement of changes in EBV-DNA load at early times post-transplant using sensitive and standardized techniques, coupled to appropriate and timely EBV loadguided therapeutic intervention may reduce and even prevent PTLD in the transplant setting.\n\nHuman Adenoviruses (HAdV) are a highly genetically divergent group of DNA viruses consisting of seven species with 54 types. A few of these HAdV types (1, 2, 5 and 31) are clearly associated with infections of immunosuppressed patients as for example haematopoietic stem cell recipients. These HAdV types are not typical opportunistic agents but also cause less severe diseases in immunocompetent patients. HAdV can persist for several months to years after an acute infection even in immunocompetent hosts and are more prevalent in children than in adults. Complications due to HAdV in haematopoetic stem cell recipients may originate from HAdV persistence and de novo infections. Due to HAdV persistence, diagnosis of HAdV disease cannot be made by mere detection of HAdV DNA. In case of organ related HAdV diseases, diagnosis is feasible by HAdV detection at the putative infection site, e.g. in case of cystitis by HAdV detection in urine. HAdV infection can also lead to potentially fatal disseminated HAdV disease. Main risk factors are young age, lymphopenia, T cell depletion and high dosage of immunosuppressive drugs. Diagnosis of the disseminated HAdV disease has been simplified by HAdV load testing in peripheral blood samples using quantitative HAdV PCR. High virus loads (>1e6 genome equivalents/ml) were clearly associated with disseminated disease whereas low virus loads (<1e4 genome equivalents/ml) can be observed in case of HAdV latency. However, a precise threshold HAdV load value has not yet been determined. Disseminated disease may be predicted in case of rapidly rising HAdV loads in blood. Pathophysiology of HAdV disseminated disease includes massive virus replication in affected organs as for example the liver which may be infected by interaction of HAdV capsids with clotting factor X. Furthermore binding of HAdV capsids to platelets, formation of immune complexes with preformed HAdV specific antibodies as well as induction of cytokines may contribute to the pathophysiology of disseminated HAdV disease. An antiviral treatment for HAdV disease has not yet been established.\n\nCidofovir may have beneficial effects if applicated early but may fail if applicated in case of very high virus loads. HAdV specific T-lymphocytes seem to be a promising therapeutic approach because risk of disseminated HAdV disease is clearly associated with lymphopenia. However, HAdV specific T lymphocytes must be prepared before onset of disease in order to be available in time.\n\nIdentification of microbial isolates by MALDI-TOF MS of whole cells gains more and more acceptance in clinical microbiology. The reliability of this technology depends largely on the reference database and the algorithm for spectral comparison. Most simply, a sample's spectrum is directly compared to spectra of reference strains and as a result a rated list of matches is provided. A more elaborate approach is realized in the (Spectral Archive and Microbial Identification System (SARAMIS). SARAMIS uses a comprehensive database of mass spectral data of reference strains for automated identification. Two types of spectral data are contained in the database: so called SuperSpectra for fully automated first-line identification (including result transmission) and Reference Spectra for semi-automated second-line identification. The concept of SuperSpectra has been developed in consideration of the natural, intra-specific diversity encountered in all microbial species. This diversity is also reflected in mass spectral fingerprints of individual isolates as variations in peak patterns, which complicates the selection of appropriate reference data. To compute SuperSpectra, spectral fingerprints of a number of 10\u221220 isolates of a species are searched for conserved mass signals that are summarized in a consensus spectrum. In a second step, each mass in the consensus spectrum is compared to the entire reference database to establish its specificity at different taxonomic levels. By doing so, mass signals can be selected that are specific at a desired taxonomic level, e.g., species-specific. By excluding masses from the consensus spectra that are specific only at higher taxonomic levels, the pattern of the remaining masses is highly specific. This makes random matches highly improbable, practically excluding false identifications. The SARAMIS database contains at present 2700 SuperSpectra, representing 900 microbial species. Since SuperSpectra by definition represent typical isolates of a species (not to be confused with type strains), a certain percentage of isolates of a given species will not be captured in automated routine analysis. In this case, the second-line identification starts that applies a direct comparison to all 35,000+ Reference Spectra in the database (representing 1500 species). By this two-step approach basically all clinically, most veterinary and, increasingly, environmental isolates can be reliably identified by a largely automated procedure.\n\nObjectives: To compare identification of routine bacterial isolates using the SARAMIS identification system and conventional methods. Methods: Consecutive bacterial isolates from urine-and bloodcultures were identified using conventional biochemical methods or VITEK II. All isolates were subsequently identified using MALDI-TOF (AXIMA@SARAMIS \u00ae ). Discrepant isolates will be further identified by means of 16S RNA sequencing. Results: A total of 3,695 isolates (1,095 from blood, 2,600 from urine) were included. 71.8% of the isolates showed fully agreement on specieslevel, for another 9.7% fully agreement on genus-level was achieved. 15.7% of the isolates could not be identified by MALDI-TOF using the 95% identification-score. In 2.8% of the isolates, the two methods gave different identification. These isolates are currently subject to further characterization by 16S RNA sequencing. Conclusion: MALDI-TOF (AXIMA@SARAMIS \u00ae ) gives a fast and reliable identification of commonly encountered bacterial isolates in a clinical microbiology laboratory but has certain limitations. Enterobacteriaceae (apart from Shigella), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Haemophilus influenza, Staphylococcus, Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium could usually be identfied to species level. Anaerobes and streptococci were often unidentified.\n\nT. Maier, B. Wegemann, S. Schubert\u00b0, M. Kostrzewa (Bremen, Munich, DE) Objectives: Automated blood cultivation of patients with suspicion for sepsis is a routine clinical approach. Fast and accurate species identification of microorganisms after signalling of growth is of fundamental interest. Currently, the identification takes up to two days because of the necessity for sub-cultivation and biochemical identification. The presented simple protocol has the potential to shorten the identification time to minutes. Methods: Blood cultures spiked with bacteria or yeast were used for method establishment, inoculated blood cultures and routine samples to optimize and validate the protocol. 1ml of a blood culture was mixed with 200ml of lysis solution followed by vortexing and centrifugation. Thereby, blood cells were disrupted but bacteria and yeast survived. Supernatant was removed and the pellet carefully suspended in wash solution. After centrifugation supernatant was removed and bacteria from the pellet were transferred to a MALDI target directly or after a short extraction procedure. Species ID was achieved by measurement in a MALDI-TOF MS mass spectrometer followed by analysis with the MALDI Biotyper software. The method was optimized by varying volumes and ratios of blood culture liquid and lysis solution. Results: Positive blood cultures showed an average cell density of about 10 7 cfu/ml and a high number of blood cells. The presented protocol was able to remove blood cells extensively without significant loss of microorganisms. Therefore, resulting MALDI-TOF spectra were of high quality. Different bacterial species (enterobacteria, Gram negative non-fermenting bacteria, staphylococci, enterococci, streptococci, Haemophilus sp.) could be identified with the procedure, reliably. Also yeasts which could not be detected with previously published protocols were identified. In some cases an identification was possible even 1\u22122 h before blood cultures were flagged positive by the automate, showing the high sensitivity of the method. Mixed cultures in most cases lead to non-identification or observation of only one species. Work on bioinformatic algorithms will improve this.\n\nThe new protocol for species identification from positive blood cultures could be demonstrated as a very fast and accurate alternative to classical methods. Identification time is shortened from days to minutes for the majority of samples, thereby enabling quicker adoption of antibiotic therapy.\n\nG. Prod'hom\u00b0, A. Bizzini, C. Durussel, J. Bille, G. Greub (Lausanne, CH) Objectives: Blood cultures are the best approach to establish the etiology of bloodstream infections. Rapid identification of etiological agent of such severe infections is pivotal to guide antimicrobial therapy. The matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) allows the identification at the species level in few minutes of bacteria by measuring molecular masses of proteins from whole bacterial extracts. We applied a simple procedure for lysing erythrocytes from positive blood cultures and prepared a bacterial pellet for MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Methods: Pellets from positive blood culture vials detected by Bactec 9240 (Becton Dickinson) were prepared by using an ammonium chloride lysing solution and centrifugation steps. Pellets were then analyzed by MALDI-TOF either by direct deposition on the target plate or after a formic acid:acetonitrile extraction step. Mass spectra were acquired using the Microflex MALDI-TOF MS (Bruker Daltonics). The identification was considered as valid at the species level when the score value was >2, as valid at the genus level when the score value was >1.7 and <2 and as not valid when the score was <1.7. The identifications obtained with MALDI-TOF MS analysis were compared with biochemical identification. Results: 122 monobacterial positive blood vials from 76 patients were analyzed. 96 (78.7%) bacterial identifications were obtained by MALDI-TOF MS analysis, of which 69 (56.6% of 122) exhibited a score value >2 and 27 (22.1%) a score value >1.7 and <2. Regardless of the score value, 95 (98.95%) of the 96 bacterial identification obtained with MALDI-TOF MS were correct at the species level and 1 correct at the genus level only. In 26 (21.3%) of cases, no reliable identification was obtained (score value <1.7). 21/26 bacteria (80.8%) were Gram positive, mainly streptococci (n = 13) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 5). Most unidentified streptococci were Streptococcus pneumoniae. Among the 5 Gram negative bacteria with a score <1.7, 4 were of encapsulated species (2 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 2 Haemophilus influenzae). Conclusion: The use of an ammonium chloride-driven hemolysis before analyzing directly positive blood cultures by MALDI-TOF MS is a very promising new method allowing fast, accurate and inexpensive identification of the etiological agents of life-threatening bloodstream infections.\n\nT. Adam\u00b0, C. Gr\u00f6ger, U. G\u00f6bel (Berlin, DE) Objectives: Early and appropriate antimicrobial therapy critically determines the outcome of bloodstream infections. Rapid identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is, hence, mandatory to adjust empirical antimicrobial therapy instituted during the first two hours after onset of symptoms. To reduce the turnaround time (TAT) aliquots from positive blood culture bottles (BC) were subjected to differential centrifugation and gel separation using BD Vacutainer SST II tubes. The preparations were used for direct identification by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS). In addition, we are optimizing a protocol for rapid AST using the Phoenix BD system. Methods: Blood cultures were drawn from septic patients and incubated using the Bactec BD blood culture device. In the rapid arm aliquots from consecutive positive BC bottles were processed for direct identification by Mass Spectrometry using the MALDI Biotyper (Bruker) system. Controls were processed according to standard procedures, inoculation of solid media and subsequent ID and AST using the MALDI Biotyper or the Vitek 2 system (bioM\u00e9rieux), respectively. In case of discrepant ID results isolates were subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing..\n\nSo far, we have tested 115 positive BCs. Direct MALDI TOF analysis resulted in 76 (66%) species identifications showing no discrepant results when compared with identification of colonies grown from these BCs. In 9 BCs more than 1 isolate could be grown on plates. Thus, in 73% of monoinfectious BCs MALDI TOF can reveal the etiologic agent in less than 1 h. Conclusion: As compared to conventional procedures the combined use of MALDI-TOF MS and rapid AST may significantly reduce the TAT in diagnosis of blood stream infections..\n\nM. Kostrzewa, C. Boogen, J. Maier, U. Weller\u00b0(Bremen, Cologne, DE) Objectives: Direct identification of bacteria from infected urine by the MALDI-Biotyper (MBT) has been shown previously. To enable quantification as well as identification, which is necessary for routine diagnostic we have tested the combination of an automated quantification system, the Uroquattro (ALIFAX HB&L), with the MALDI-TOF workflow.\n\nMethods: For this proof of concept study, 161 urine samples from routine were analysed in parallel.\n\nFor the novel combined workflow, a 500 ml aliquot was transferred into a 2ml HB&L tube with nutrient broth and stirrer, placed into the Uroquattro instrument for 3 h at 37\u00baC and the CFU value was read. Turbidity of the vials is monitored and bacterial count is calculated. After incubation, 500 ml aliquots from the positive vials were pipetted onto a 100 ml Ficoll-Paque Plus cushion and centrifuged (5 min at 15000 g in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf cup). Supernatant was discarded and part of the pellet transferred onto a MALDI target, air dried, overlayed with matrix solution (HCCA), again air dried and subjected to identification by mass spectrometry using the MBT system. This approach was compared to our standard workflow: plating the urine on 2 Petri dishes in a quantitative way, MBT identification of colonies after over night incubation at 37\u00baC. Results: A bacterial count above 10E4 CFU was obtained for 77 of the 161 samples. These patients where considered to have a bacterial infection. The bacterial count was identical to a large extend with both methods. However, MBT identification was only possible in 63 of the samples incubated in the HB&L. Here, the results matched those of the standard protocol. This was due to the presence of more than one pathogen (as shown by the standard workup) which the current identification software of the MBT can not resolve. Conclusion: This protocol enables reliable bacterial identification together with a bacterial count in few more than 3 hours in cases of mono-bacterial infection using the standard protocol of the HB&L. Ongoing improvement to the MBT identification algorithms will resolve the problem of poly-bacterial infections. Further extension of this approach to usually sterile body fluids, tracheal secretions and pleural aspirates also here may lead to a dramatic reduction in turnaround time of microbiological labs for identification and subsequent AST-testing.\n\nT. Maier, V. B\u00f6ttcher, M. Kostrzewa\u00b0(Bremen, DE) Objectives: MALDI-TOF fingerprint analysis became a valuable tool for microorganism identification and classification, recently. While for bacteria and yeasts simple and robust approaches for sample preparation have been reported, leading to reproducible results with low impact of cultivation conditions and growth state, the situation for filamentous fungi keeps more complicated. In particular, sample preparation of molds with rigid cell walls is more challenging and the fingerprint spectra derived from spores and mycel show significant differences. Also fingerprint spectra seem to be dependent on cultivation media.\n\nWe present a novel approach for sample preparation of fungi prior to MALDI-TOF MS improving reproducibility and quality of spectra, significantly. Methods: Fungal species (e.g. Aspergillus spp., Fusarium spp.) harvested from solid media were grown over night in liquid medium. Subsequently, cell material was harvested by centrifugation, and washed with water. The pellet was dried well and extracted using 35% formic acid/50% acetonitrile. 1ml of the extract was spotted onto a MALDI target, dried on air, and overlaid with HCCA matrix. Mass spectra were acquired in the linear mode, mass range 2000 to 20000 Da, using a microflex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen). Spectra were analysed using the flexAnalysis software, reference libraries were created and bioinformatic analyses were performed with the MALDI Biotyper 2.0 software (Bruker Daltonik). Results: Culture in liquid medium has lead to mycelia without spores and thereby largely homogenous cell material. These samples facilitated a successful protein extraction by a simple, short standardised method. Mass spectra generated based on the novel sample preparation method were reproducible and contained many characteristic peaks, thereby leading to a significantly improved identification security. Further, the higher quality of spectra increased the differentiation power of the method and could highlight subspecies differences. A core database of 50 filamentous species has been established and used for first comparative studies. Technical and biological replicates could be identified successfully as well as isolates not included in the database. Reproducibility of results obtained with different mass spectrometers could be demonstrated.\n\nThe presented approach may lead to significant improvement of fungal identification in clinical or other routine applications. Objectives and Method: Mass spectrometry is presented as a modern analytical tool for fungal strain typing and diagnosing fungal infections. Results: Qualitative and quantitative proteomics approaches are documented on various Aspergillus strains: virulence protein factors present on fungal spores are identified by peptide mapping, peptide-and de novo-sequencing. Quantitative proteomics is addressed by NOVA-Q in house-developed software improving the precision of results in samples labeled by SILAC. Metabonomics approach is illustrated by the detection of minor macrolide antibiotics produced by Streptomyces strains. Peptidomics is represented by tracking non-ribosomal cyclic peptides and depsipeptides produced by Beauveria, Paecilomyces and Pseudallescheria genera. Peptide profiles are used as chemotaxonomic tools. Patented unique non-ribosomal lasso-peptide structures are reported as extremely specific fungal markers. Glycomics and lipidomics armory is illustrated by hexosylceramide analysis in Scedosporium by Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. Clinical samples (tissues, whole blood) handling by advanced ambient ionization techniques is reported with special focus to lipids in brain, eye bulb and lungs (murine, porcine). The fungal infections in plants is addressed by DAPPI mass imaging.\n\nThe current advances in mass spectrometry will lay the experimental foundation for modern sensitive diagnostic tools. We predict that particularly mass imaging of tissues infected by molds will lead to discovery of specific fungal biomarkers.\n\nA. Borovskaya\u00b0, M. Sukhorukova, A. Nikulin, E. Ilina, S. Zhukova, M. Edelstein, T. Maier, M. Kostrzewa, V. Govorun (Moscow, Smolensk, RU; Bremen, DE) Objectives: S. aureus and several species of coagulase-negative staphylococci are common human pathogens. Therefore, comprehensive and accurate identification of Staphylococcus species is of great importance. Several ID methods based on conventional physiological or biochemical characterization are commercially available in manual and automated formats. The presented study aimed to examine the accuracies of manual identification tests, BD Phoenix TM system and MALDI Biotyper system for the discrimination of Staphylococcus species. Methods: A total of 301 clinical isolates of staphylococci were studied. For conventional species identification, manual or semi automated biochemical identification systems (bioM\u00e9rieux, France) were used. All isolates were also identified by Phoenix TM automated microbiology system (BD Diagnostic Systems, USA) as well as by MALDI Biotyper technique (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Germany) which is based on fingerprinting of mass spectra acquired from fresh bacterial cultures. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed as confirmatory approach for discordant cases. Results: Clinical isolates from 31 regions of the Russian Federation were investigated including 101 isolates presumably identified by conventional microbiological methods as coagulase-negative staphylococci and 200 isolates reported as S. aureus. A discordance between conventional methods of identification and the other tested technologies was found in 9 (2.9%) cases for MALDI Biotyper technique, and in 29 (9.6%) ones for BD Phoenix TM automated system. Discordant results of ID using the Biotyper and Phoenix were obtained for 24 (8.0%) isolates. Unambiguous species ID was achieved by MALDI Biotyper technique and Phoenix TM automated system in 292 (97.0%) and 277 (92.0%) cases, respectively. Likewise, 8 (3.8%) and 21 (7.0%) isolates, respectively, were identified at the genus level only. Two isolates (0.7%) did not belong to the Staphylococcus genus according to both approaches. The discrepant cases were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing which confirmed the benefits of MALDI Biotyper ID results in most of the cases.\n\nThe MALDI Biotyper technique was superior to the manual and automated (BD Phoenix) biochemical tests for the species identification of staphylococci.\n\nA. Ingebretsen\u00b0, M.Z. Pino, J.V. Bj\u00f8rnholt (Oslo, NO) Objective: Compare MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) with established automated identification systems for anaerobic bacteria. All methods were compared to 16s rDNA sequencing. Methods: 66 isolates from our routine diagnostic laboratory cultured on non-selective media to secure pure culture, aged no more than 24\u221248 hours, underwent Gram staining, catalase testing and spot indole if requested by the identification method. Otherwise standard procedures as specified by manufacturer were followed for VITEK 2 Anaerobic and Corynebacteria identification with VITEK 2 and the BD BBL Crystal Anaerobe ID kit with the BBL autoreader. For sequencing of the 16s rRNA gene, DNA was extracted using the Prepman Ultra protocol (Applied Biosciences) and thereafter performed according to standard procedure using an ABI 3730 sequencer and the BLASTn search tool. Identification of the microorganisms by MS was performed using the Microflex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik GmbH) with the Biotyper 2.0 software. Preparation of the bacteria was performed using the ethanol/formic acid extraction procedure according to the manufacturer (Bruker Daltonik GmbH). All bacteria were analyzed in duplicates. The Biotyper 2.0 software generates a list of species matches ranked by a log score value. In this study we accepted the score value of 1.7 and higher if the duplicates matched each other. Results:36 different anaerobic species were identified. Proportion of isolates identified correctly according to species group compared to 16s rDNA sequencing are presented in table 1. Generally MALDI-TOF MS performed better than the 2 automated systems, although short comings were present for some species. Of the two automated systems the VITEK2 Anaerobic and Corynebacteria identification card performed marginally better than the BD BBL Crystal TM Anaerobe ID kit. Conclusion: The automated systems for anaerobic identification show limited performances. Although the MALDI-TOF MS performed better, significant shortcomings are also present. The latter could be explained by database limitations of the MALDI Biotyper 2.0 software, i.e. several subspecies of Fusobacterium nucleatum have been described but are not included. At present time 16s rDNA sequencing remains the gold standard but may be somewhat replaced by MALDI TOF MS in the near future depending on further development of the database. The 2 automated identification systems can be used in adjunction to more conventional identification. Objective: Despite the identification of SARS-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats in China, the evolutionary and possible recombination origin of SARS-CoV remains undetermined. To better define the epidemiology and evolution of bat-SARS-CoV in China and their role as recombination origin of SARS-CoV in civet, a four-year study on coronaviruses in Chinese horseshoe bats in Hong Kong and Guangdong province of southern China was conducted. Methods: Respiratory and alimentary samples were collected from 1401 Chinese horseshoe bats captured in Hong Kong and Guangdong province of southern China over a four-year period and were detected for coronaviruses by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Five hundred and eleven bats from Hong Kong were also tagged to study the migration pattern of bats and viral persistence. The complete genomes of 10 strains of bat-SARS-CoV obtained at different time were sequenced and compared to the previously characterized genomes.\n\nResults: Bat-SARS-CoV was detected in alimentary specimens from 130 (9.3%) bats, with peak activity during spring. Bats carrying the viruses appeared healthy, with viral clearance occurring between two weeks to four months. Tagging exercise showed that migration distances of Chinese horseshoe bats in Hong Kong range from 1.86 to 17 km. Complete genome sequencing of 10 strains of bat-SARS-CoV revealed frequent recombination between different strains, especially among the bat viruses in China. Recombination was detected between bat-SARS-CoV Rp3 from Guangxi and Rf1 from Hubei in the possible generation of civet SARS-CoV SZ3, with breakpoint at nsp16/spike region. Conclusion: Bat-SARS-CoV causes acute, self-limiting infection in horseshoe bats which serve as reservoir for recombination between virus strains from different geographical locations within reachable foraging range. Civet SARS-CoV is likely a recombinant virus arising from bat-SARS-CoV strains closely related to Rp3 and Rf1. Such frequent recombination in these animals may have accounted for the cross-species transmission and emergence of SARS.\n\nO544 Epidemiology and control of Q fever in the Netherlands, 2007 -2009 Objectives: Q fever is caused by Coxiella burnetii. Sheep and goats are frequently described as the source. Humans are usually infected through inhalation and half of the infected show symptoms. Before 2007, Q fever was a rare disease in the Netherlands. Since 2005, Q fever emerged in small ruminants and subsequently in 2007 in the human population leading to the largest Q fever outbreak recorded up to date. Methods: Analysis of data from public health facilities, regional laboratories, the Animal Health Service and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment to describe the Q fever outbreak occurring in the Netherlands. Results: In the spring of 2007, Q fever occurred in a village in the province of Noord Brabant with 168 cases. In 2008 and 2009 increasingly larger outbreaks occurred in an increasingly wider area. By November 2009, more than 3000 cases have been notified. Six patients have died. The number of chronic cases is not known. So far, contact with hay/manure and a house location close to an infected dairy goat farm have been identified as important risk factors for human Q fever. In the affected area dairy goat farming is common and goat density per square kilometre is the highest in the Netherlands. Since 2005 and preceding the human outbreaks, abortion waves caused by C. burnetii have been noticed on 27 dairy goat farms and 2 dairy sheep farms in the regions where most of the human cases occurred. Sampling of incriminated farms, animals and surroundings resulted in detection of C. burnetii. Preliminary MLVA analysis points at spreading of a single clone in goats, however the presence of this clone is not yet widely confirmed in humans. Control measures including mandatory veterinary notification as well as hygiene measures during spread of manure, lambing season and mass vaccination of goats and sheep are being implemented. Preliminary results of the monitoring of vaccination indicate a decrease of the abortion rate in the vaccinated groups to zero and a drop in bulkmilk levels of C. burnetii DNA. Conclusion: The Q fever outbreak starting in 2007 in the Netherlands is still on going. It is mainly restricted to the south of the country in an area with intense dairy goat farming. However the epidemic has been expanding to other areas in 2009. The effect of control measures is still to be awaited. Epidemiological data point towards the intensive dairy goat farming as the main source of the outbreak. Objectives: An outbreak of Q-fever with over 3300 notified cases is ongoing in the Netherlands. Since 2007, immunofluorescence assay (IFA) has been the cornerstone of Q-fever serology in our hospital. IFA, however, is time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Furthermore, the lag phase in antibody response to Coxiella burnetii administration within 4 hours than with later administration. Timing was not associated with LOT, TCS or short-and long-term mortality. 12.0 (95% CI: 9.9-14.1) 14.5 (95% CI 12.0-17.0) 0.041 LOT (days) 11.3 (95% CI: 10.0-12.6) 11.6 (95% CI 10.2-13.0) 0.978 TCS (days) 11.5 (95% CI: 8.6-14.5) 11.5 (95% CI 9.8-13.1) 0.286 30-day mortality 5 (10.6%) 7 (9.9%) 0.891 6-month-mortality 7 (14.9%) 11 (15.5%) 0.929 O568 FOCUS 2: randomized, double-blinded, multicentre phase 3 study of the efficacy and safety of ceftaroline vs. ceftriaxone in community-acquired bacterial pneumonia P. Eckburg\u00b0, H.D. Friedland, J. Lee, L. Llorens, I. Critchley, D. Thye (Oakland, US) Objectives: Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common pathogen and there are growing concerns about the rising incidence of resistant or highly virulent pathogens, such as multidrug-resistant S. pneumoniae (MDRSP) and community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Ceftaroline (CPT), a novel, parenteral, broad-spectrum cephalosporin with bactericidal activity against common Gram-positive organisms, including MDRSP and MRSA, as well as common Gram-negative pathogens, was evaluated for the treatment of CABP (Clinical Trials ID NCT00509106). Methods: Hospitalized adult patients from 84 centres in 14 countries with moderate to severe CABP (PORT Risk Class III or IV) requiring intravenous therapy received CPT 600 mg q12 h or ceftriaxone (CRO)1 g q24 h for 5 to 7 days (randomized 1:1). Clinical and microbiological responses and adverse events (AEs) were assessed. The primary objective was to determine non-inferiority (pre-specified CI margin of \u221210%) in clinical cure rate of CPT compared with CRO at the test-of-cure visit (8 to 15 days post-therapy) in the clinically evaluable (CE) and modified intent-to-treat efficacy (MITTE) populations. Secondary objectives included evaluation of clinical cure in the microbiologically evaluable (ME) and microbiological modified intent-to-treat efficacy (mMITTE) populations. Table. Both CPT and CRO were well tolerated; most common AEs for CPT were diarrhoea (3.8% vs 2.9% for CRO), headache (3.5% vs 1.6%), and insomnia (3.2% vs 2.6%). AEs led to study drug discontinuation in 5.1% and 4.2% of patients treated with CPT and CRO, respectively. Conclusions: CPT demonstrated non-inferiority to ceftriaxone in treating patients hospitalized with moderate to severe CABP in the CE and MITTE study populations of FOCUS 2. Clinical cure rates in the 2 co-primary populations and in patients with a confirmed bacterial infection were numerically higher for CPT compared with CRO. CPT had high clinical cure rates and was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to ceftriaxone. CPT has the potential to be an effective, welltolerated treatment option for CABP.\n\nJ. Seddon\u00b0, R. Vancheeswaran, D. Mack (London, UK) Objective: Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United Kingdom. The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) has been recommended for all adults 65 years and over and younger adults with chronic medical conditions or immunosuppression since 2005. The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced into the routine childhood immunization program in September 2006. We aimed to look at pneumococcal bacteraemia serotypes and PCV immunization history in our district general hospital population. Methods: Patients who had pneumococcal bacteraemia between October 2008 and April 2009 were identified retrospectively. Isolates were sent to the United Kingdom Health Protection Agency reference laboratory for serotyping. Clinical details were acquired via case note review. Immunization status was obtained from general practitioners.\n\nWe identified 29 adults with pneumococcal bacteraemia and obtained clinical details for 28. There were 18 patients for whom PPV is currently recommended. Of these seven (47%) had been immunized, of whom two (29%) died; eight had no history of immunization, of whom two (25%) died. For three cases immunization history was not obtained. The total mortality for this group of 18 was 28%. Pneumococcal serotype results were available for 23 patients. Of these, six patients had received PPV, of whom four (66%) acquired infections with serotypes covered by PPV. Of the ten patients who had not received PPV, nine had serotypes covered by PPV. In total, 5 isolates (22%) were not covered by PPV or PCV7, and 14 isolates (61%) were covered by PPV but not PCV7. The total number of isolates covered by PPV was 18 (78%) ( Table 1) .\n\nIn this small study, we observed a high rate of mortality in patients for whom PPV is recommended which was similar in those who had (29%) and had not (25%) received PPV. Uptake of vaccine where recommended was sub-optimal (39%). We observed four cases of apparent failure of the PPV vaccine to protect against IPD with pneumococcal serotypes covered by PPV. This is in keeping with observations that PPV is incompletely protective against IPD. Of the 23 isolates serotyped, 14 (61%) were covered by PPV but not PCV7. As serotypes may spread from the paediatric to the adult population, these may represent serotype-replacement following the introduction of PCV7. Promotion of vaccine uptake and ongoing serotype monitoring is warranted. Objectives: We evaluated distribution of serotypes among adults with pneumococcal Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) in the Netherlands in order to determine potential vaccine coverage.\n\nIn a prospective, observational study in 22 Dutch hospitals, patients ( 18years) admitted to the ER with a clinically suspected CAP were included between January 2008 and March 2009. Recent hospitalization (<2 wks), stay in long-term care facilities, known bronchial obstruction or a history of post-obstructive pneumonia, primary or metastatic lung cancer, AIDS/ PCP/ TBC and unconsciousness were exclusion criteria. History taking, physical examination, biochemical and hematological blood testing, blood-and sputum cultures and BINAX pneumococcal urinary antigen testing were performed in all patients. All pneumococcal bacteremia isolates were serotyped (at the Netherlands Reference Laboratory Amsterdam). Pneumococcal CAP was defined on the presence of clinical criteria for CAP, radiographic confirmation by a radiologist and isolation of S. pneumoniae from blood or sputum (if dominant flora) or positive antigen testing in urine. Results: Of 1631 included patients, 1115 had radiographically confirmed CAP and 210 (18.8%) had pneumococcal CAP, diagnosed on isolation of S. pneumoniae from blood culture (n = 82, 7.3% of all bloodcultures), sputum culture (n = 24), or positive urinary antigen test (n = 151). 75 bacteremia isolates were serotyped. Serotypes 14 (n = 9), 1, 7F, 19A and 22F (n = 8) were most common. Potential vaccine coverage was 28% for the 7-valent, 67% for the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) and 93% for 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PS). Conclusion: Based on bacteremia isolates vaccine coverage would be 67% with 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine that is currently investigated in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial in the Netherlands. O571 Serotype-specific mortality risk among patients with invasive pneumococcal disease: Swedish population-based study P. Naucler\u00b0, J. Darenberg,\u00c5.\u00d6rtqvist, B. Henriques Normark (Stockholm, SE) Objectives: To investigate pneumococcal serotype-specific mortality risk correlated to the serotype invasive disease potential among patients with invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Methods: In Sweden it is mandatory to report IPD and isolates are collected for serotyping and molecular typing. Of 4195 episodes of IPD among adults reported between Jan 2007 to Oct 2009 a total of 3692 isolates were serotyped (88%). A questionnaire study was performed to obtain clinical and socio-demographic information about patients with serotyped IPD [obtained for 1657/3692 patients (45%)]. In a preliminary analysis of the 1657 patients we assessed the absolute serotype-specific 30-day mortality risks and relative risks using regression modeling on group level according to previously defined invasive disease potential [high (serotypes 1 and 7), medium (serotypes 4, 9, 14 and 18) and low (serotypes 3, 6A, 6B, 8, 15, 19, 33 and 38) and for individual serotypes. Risk estimates were adjusted for potential confounders. Results: Pneumococcal serotype prevalence ranged from 0.05% for serotype 5 to 13.4% for serotype 14 and was stable over the observed period. Absolute mortality risk was highest for serotypes with low invasive disease potential (12.8%) followed by serotypes with medium-(8.6%) and high (4.9%) invasive disease potential. Serotypes with low invasive disease potential were associated with increased mortality risk in unadjusted but not adjusted analyses [relative risks 2.62 (95% CI 1.38-5.00) and 1.61 (95% CI 0.84-3.09) respectively] and a test for trend according to invasive disease potential was significant in unadjusted (p-value: 0.001) but not adjusted (p-value: 0.10) analyses. Patients infected with serotypes of lower invasive disease potential were older, more likely to be diagnosed with meningitis, suffer from chronic disease and immunosuppression (all p-values <0.003). Serotype 3, 6B, 11A, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F were associated with increased mortality risk in crude analyses but only serotype 6B and 11A were associated with increased mortality risk in adjusted analyses.\n\nIn this large population-based study host risk factors appeared to be the strongest determinants of both risk of infection with serotypes according to invasive disease potential as well as mortality outcome."}
