Accurately reconstructed evolutionary features on specific functional 24 domains can in turn provide biological information on viral protein and immune targets for 25 vaccine design. In this study we developed and evaluated a structurally informed partitioning 26 scheme that accounts for rate variation among immunogenic head and stalk domains of the 27 surface protein hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza viruses. We evaluated the model fit and 28 performance of four different models -HKY, SRD06 codon, HKY with a structurally informed 29 partitioning scheme, SRD06 with a structurally informed partitioning scheme on pandemic 30 A/H1N1pdm09, seasonal A/H1N1postpdm, A/H3N2, B-Yamagata-like and Victoria-like 31 lineages, and two highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses H5Nx and H7N9. Results showed 32 that structurally informed partitioning with SRD06 performed better for all datasets with 33 decisively statistical support. Significantly faster nucleotide substitution rates for head domain, 34 compared to stalk domain was observed and may provide insight for stalk derived broadly-35 reactive vaccine design. Taken together, integrating a functionally informed partitioning scheme 36 based on protein structures of immune targets allows for significant improvement of 37 phylogenetic analysis and providing important biological insights.\n\nIntroduction 39 The importance of statistical phylogenetic methods to study the epidemiology, evolution 40 and ecology of rapidly evolving viral pathogens has been driven by the growing availability of 41 whole genome sequences (1). Precisely estimating the pattern of genetic variations is critical to 42 reconstruct the accurate pathogen phylogenies (2,3). Nucleotide substitution models have been 43 developed to describe the process of change from one nucleic state to another among viral 44 isolates, where they often allow for rate variations between transitions and transversions (4), or 45 incorporate nucleotide base frequencies with substitution rate parameters (5,6).

The tree branches 94 with domain-specific rate ratio dC1+2/dC3 can inform the approximate selection pressure on each 95 strain, suggesting some biological explanations related to antigenic drift and emerging strains. 96 The structurally informed phylogenetic model may reveal novel biological insights of viral 97 evolution and have the potential to reveal more biological realism without over-parameterization. \n\nModel selection 101 To compare the four models, the log scale Bayes Factor (BF) was used, which was the 102 difference of log marginal likelihood estimations from two models. Marginal likelihood 103 estimation was conducted with two approachespath-sampling and stepping-stone sampling, 104 where both generated consistent results. Based on the model selection procedure for all subtypes 105 ( Fig. 1) , the model with mixed partitioning on both codon positions and HA protein structure 106 (CP model in Fig. 1c ) had decisive BF support for better model fitting in all datasets compared to 107 All rights reserved.

Therefore, how to partition on the 229 protein structure with genetic data is critical. One solution is to compare all possible partitioning 230 schemes for a given genetic sequence dataset to find the best partitioning strategy (3). However, (H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, H9, H11, H12, H13, H16, and H17) and Group 2 (H3, H4, H7, H10, H14 287 and H15) (25), respectively, it is probably amongst the most promising approaches to design a 288 universal influenza vaccine. 289 While this model has been developed with influenza in mind, there is potential to apply 290 this approach to other viruses.
