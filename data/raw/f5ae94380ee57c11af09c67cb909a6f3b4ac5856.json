{"title": "Oil prices, climate change-health challenges in Saudi Arabia", "body": "foods, such as sugar-sweetened beverages and energydense, nutrient-poor foods, in the school environment; informed nutrition education as part of the core curriculum; and ensuring levels of physical activity for all children according to WHO recommendations.\n\nIn addition to the new approaches, the imperative to implement existing standards has been underlined. ECHO noted the disappointing lack of progress on implementation of WHO's Set of Recommendations on the Marketing of Foods and Non-alcoholic Beverages to Children. 8 It reiterates the need to implement regulatory measures, such as the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes, 9 and to develop regulations on the marketing of complementary foods and beverages for infants and young children.\n\nECHO's recommendations call for various stakeholders to take action, such as WHO to institutionalise a crosscutting and life-course approach to ending childhood obesity and for civil society, philanthropic and academic institutions, and the private sector to mobilise their comparative advantage to end childhood obesity (panel 2). These actions notwithstanding, ECHO remains fi rmly of the opinion that it is the primary responsibility of governments to ensure that policies and actions address the obesogenic environment and to provide guidance and support for optimum development at each stage of the life-course. By improving and integrating these actions, there will be major benefi ts to other parts of the maternal, reproductive, child health, and non-communicable disease prevention and control and health systems agendas. First, along with the rising oil revenues in recent decades, Saudi Arabia has seen a rapid epidemiological transition in the population (table). 4 The uptake of some health-promoting behaviours has been limited by Saudia Arabia's unemployment rate (11\u00b77% in 2014), moderate levels of education, and climatic and sociocultural conditions. 3, 5, 6 The high burden of undiagnosed and uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension, 6,7 will consume a large proportion of the health budget. 8 Second, future temperature in the region is projected to increase consistently and exceed the threshold deemed unsuitable for human adaptability. 9 This changing climate will have an eff ect on the promotion of some healthy lifestyle habits, the country's production of fresh fruits and vegetables, and micronutrient defi ciencies. 9 For example, vitamin D defi ciency from inadequate exposure to sun and limited intake of enriched products is common in Saudi Arabia. 10 Finally, there is a need for sustained investment in the control of emerging infectious diseases in the region. Such control eff orts are important given the risk of emerging diseases within Saudi Arabia, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome, and as a result of disease importation through the large expatriate workforce and the 2-3 million pilgrims for Hajj and 5-6 million pilgrims for Umrah who come to Saudi Arabia each year from more than 180 countries. 3, 11 Although economic recession is often feared as a \"health tragedy\", evidence from high-income countries is mixed and related to variations in social and political contexts. 12, 13 In high-income countries, some health indices showed counter-cyclical eff ects with economic contractions (eg, increases in suicides, depression, and anxiety disorders and worsening reproductive health outcomes). 12, 13 However, mortality is shown to be pro-cyclical and it decreases during rapid economic contractions. In high-income countries, there are generally slower declines in mortality during periods of economic growth and greater declines in mortality during recessions. 13 In low-income countries, economic growth seems to improve health through improvements in basic services, until a country reaches $5000-10 000 GDP per person. 12 Declines in mortality in high-income countries during recession could be related to decline in excess mortality from modifi able causes of death, such as those arising from alcohol abuse and motor vehicle accidents. 12, 13 Given that Saudi Arabia has one of the highest rates of traffi c-related deaths globally, 4 the country might benefi t from the austerity measures in this regard. If Saudi Arabia maintains increased relief spending on child health, improvements in access to nutrition and health, and strong infectious diseases control then these approaches can also help reduce mortality.\n\nSince Saudi Arabia's sociodemographic and geopolitical foundation is diff erent from that of the case studies available thus far, it is diffi cult to predict potential health eff ects of the present economic recession and newly proposed health-sector reforms. Saudi nationals (and pilgrims coming to Mecca for the Hajj) are entitled to free health care and the government accounted for 66% of health care spending in 2012 (about 5% of GDP). 3 The expatriate workforce of Saudi Arabia, which accounts for 56% of the total population and about 86% of the private sector workforce, are not covered by the government health-care system. 3, 5 The proposed nationalisation process to reduce the expatriate workforce by employing more Saudi nationals in the employment sector could adversely aff ect the health-care workforce since about 77% of physicians and 63% of nursing staff in Saudi Arabia are expatriates. 3 A much needed boost in the country's health promotion portfolio would require expertise in various public health disciplines that are currently in short supply in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe greatest burden of economic recession generally falls on the unemployed. 12, 13 About a third of the 30 million population of Saudi Arabia are younger than 15 years, and the child dependency ratio is 44% (ratio of people below working age to workforce). 3 In 2013, the rate of unemployment in Saudi Arabian nationals was 28\u00b74% for people aged 15-29 years (men 17\u00b75%, women 60\u00b73%). 3,5 A recent emphasis on privatisation of health and preventive care, or even cost sharing of preventive care, could lead to an increase in overall health-care costs if people forego essential medications, immunisations, or routine clinic visits such as antenatal care.\n\nHigh body-mass index 12\n\nDietary risks 10\n\nRaised fasting plasma glucose 10\n\nHigh blood pressure 8 We do not know how long the current economic downturn will last in Saudi Arabia. Anticipating potential eff ects of recession at an early stage of the crisis can inform health-sector reforms to diminish or avoid its harmful consequences on nation's health. Despite Saudi Arabia's unique challenges, the Ministry of Health has so far been successful in providing state-of-the-art medical services to its citizens. For example, Saudi Arabia's premarital sickle cell screening is a unique initiative. 14 Despite free health care, Saudi Arabia's shortcomings are in the control of non-communicable diseases and mitigation of risk factors for disease. 4 Only 23% of Saudi adults have had a preventive care visit. 15, 16 There is a need to consider multipronged approaches to health promotion and avoidance of risk factors, including those that fall outside the services of health ministry (eg, enforcement of motor vehicle accident prevention advisories, point of sale restrictions on tobacco). By training primary care providers to serve as advocates for health promotion, each encounter between the provider and patient can be used as an opportunity to educate patients about a set of prevention messages. Informed personal decision making is important to increase the uptake of healthy lifestyles and prevention recommendations; this is a process achieved through education and a sense of personal empowerment that comes with employment. Outreach to civic organisations for partnerships in health promotion initiatives can help increase visibility and uptake.\n\nBeyond the immediate eff ects of the current economic crisis, Saudi Arabia needs to target its policies to mitigate the eff ects of climate change. Agricultural approaches such as hydroponics, vertical farming, and landscaping with food-producing plants can increase food production, enable healthy eating habits, and improve air quality. Additionally, enrichment of food products (vitamin D, folic acid, iodine) is an easy and cheaper alternative to promotion of supplement use by individuals. The transition in the country's health-care delivery to the private sector and cost-sharing should be implemented without compromising services for the unemployed and uninsured. Similarly, eff orts to nationalise the health labour force should consider continuity in essential service delivery.\n\nSaudi Arabia's religious leadership can encourage the population to adhere to guidance on health promotion, which is particularly important for mental health where health-care infrastructure is not adequate. Health security cannot be achieved by focused eff orts from the health ministry alone; nations that off er greater social safety nets are better positioned to diminish the health eff ects of economic recession. 12 Finally, implementation of evidence from case studies on the health eff ects of the economic crisis are useful and can contribute to the emerging body of literature on economics and health. Health-care reform was long overdue in Saudi Arabia and the current crisis aff ords the country an opportunity to do it right. Saudi Arabia's future health security will rely on the choices made today by its health policy makers.\n\nMinistry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (ZAM); College of Medicine, Alfaisal University, Riyadh 11514, Saudi Arabia (ZAM); and Atlanta, Georgia, USA (HE) zmemish@yahoo.com\n\nWe declare no competing interests."}
