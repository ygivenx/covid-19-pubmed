{"title": "", "body": "Oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu) is the pro-drug of oseltamivir carboxylate, the effective form. Oseltamivir phosphate dissociates in the gastrointestinal tract to form oseltamivir, which is absorbed and metabolised into oseltamivir carboxylate by hepatic carboxylesterase (h-CE). Oseltamivir may have a central depressant action (Hama 2008 ) and may also inhibit human sialidase (Li 2007) , causing abnormal behaviour. Inhaled zanamivir reaches a far lower plasma concentration compared to its intravenous administration (Cass 1999) . Any treatment that reduces the complications of influenza (for example, pneumonia) and the excretion of the virus from infected people might be a useful public health measure to contain an epidemic by limiting the impact and spread of the virus. In addition to symptomatic treatment, prophylactic use for interrupting the spread of disease has informed pandemic planning over the past decade.\n\nThere are three major reasons for conducting this review, in addition to questions of efficacy associated with the clinical use of NIs for influenza: 1. Influenza antivirals are a commonly used and stockpiled drug against past and future pandemics on the basis of international and national recommendations. These recommendations are based on the claimed and assumed ability of the drug to reduce complications and transmission (HHS 2005; WHO 2007 ). In theory, containing the spread of influenza allows time for an organised response with longer-term interventions (such as vaccines), which take time to produce (WHO 2007).\n\n2. There are legitimate reasons to doubt these claims and the results of previous Cochrane reviews of NIs in adults (Jefferson 2006; Jefferson 2009a ) and children (Shun-Shin 2009), due to the risk of reporting bias, including the certainty of publication bias (Doshi 2012a; Doshi 2012b).\n\n3. Oseltamivir is now on the list of WHO essential drugs (WHO 2013a; WHO 2013b).\n\nA159 is an amalgamation of two long-standing Cochrane reviews on the effects of NIs for influenza in healthy adults (Jefferson 2010a , also published as Jefferson 2009a) and children (Matheson 2007) , and it is based on the assessment of trials through their clinical study reports and other regulatory information: a decision we made after finding substantial reporting bias in the journal publications of the relevant trials. For the rationale for this process see Appendix 2.\n\nWe identified that 60% (3145/5267) of patient data from randomised, placebo-controlled, phase III treatment trials of oseltamivir have never been published. This includes M76001, the biggest treatment trial ever undertaken on oseltamivir (with just over 1400 people of all ages). Exclusion of unpublished data changed our previous findings regarding the ability of oseltamivir to reduce the complications of influenza (Doshi 2009; Jefferson 2009a) . In some cases, mistakes in the attribution of adverse events were only discovered through matching summary tables with individual participant listings (Gravenstein 2013; Peters 2001; WV15825).\n\nWe have modified the routine Cochrane processes to improve our previous methods, which we now consider inadequate. To resolve inconsistencies and under-reporting, we changed our approach by no longer including trial data as reported in papers published in biomedical journals. Instead, we treated clinical study reports as our basic unit of analysis. Clinical study reports are often sent to national drug regulators such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) (formerly EMEA), which require far more stringent standards for completeness and accuracy of reporting than biomedical journals. Journal articles can be regarded as a very succinct synthesis of a clinical study report. In addition to seeking clinical study reports, we decided to read and review regulatory documentation. The FDA in particular (and the EMA to a far lesser extent) make many of its scientific reviews available on its website. Unlike Cochrane review authors, regulators can have access to the whole data set and their comments can provide useful insight, helping to achieve a better understanding of trial programmes. Clinical study reports generally remain hidden from public view and are not readily available for wider scientific scrutiny, despite the wealth of information they contain for those willing and able to spend the time reading them and despite calls to make all relevant trial data public (Doshi 2013; Godlee 2009), as well as the known problems with reporting biases (McGauran 2010; Wieseler 2013).\n\nto harms and effects on complications is necessary to provide patients, policy-makers and physicians with a complete and unbiased view of their risks and benefits.\n\nIn response to our 2010 review (Jefferson 2009a ; Jefferson 2010a), some have argued that its findings cannot be applied to the 2009 A/H1N1, suggesting that it is a new virus and thus we need new evidence (JAID 2010; Maugh 2009; Nebehay 2009; NHS 2009; NHS 2010) . Novel A/H1N1 is a new strain of a subtype that has been circulating since 1977, but it also resembles the A/H1N1 strain that has been circulating since before 1957 (CDC 2009) or before the 1918 pandemic (Itoh 2009). Influenza subtype A/ H1N1 was indeed circulating in the clinical trials we have included in our previous reviews. In addition, oseltamivir and zanamivir were approved by regulators worldwide for the treatment and prevention of influenza types A and B, not specific subtypes or strains of influenza A and B. The expectation of regulatory approval is thus that the effects of these drugs demonstrated in clinical trials will apply to future strains of influenza A and B. Use of these drugs during the pandemic was not off-label. It was approved use because of the assumption that the clinical trial evidence underpinning regulatory approval applied to novel A/H1N1. We reviewed the clinical trial evidence with the expectation that our results, similar to regulators, will apply to all influenza viruses.\n\nThe modified approach in this Cochrane review grew out of a realisation that prior methods employed to review NIs were inadequate. There seems to be no compelling reason to think that the lessons learned are limited to these particular drugs (Godlee 2009; Rodgers 2013; Vedula 2009; Vedula 2013; Wieseler 2013). For this reason, our independent scrutiny, using all possible trial information, may inform both the wider debate on the adequacy of existing regulatory frameworks in the adoption of new drugs and the question of whether other systematic reviews should move to this new, more rigorous, approach, which focuses on trial programmes rather than single trials (Eyding 2010; Ioannidis 2010) (see Glossary, Appendix 1). Although there is substantial evidence for the effects of reporting bias in estimates of effectiveness, less is known of its impact on the evidence of harms (Chou 2005) . We decided to quantify the additional resources required to follow our modified methodological approach to assess the feasibility of other systematic reviews proceeding in a similar fashion. See the Differences between protocol and review section for the previous version of the objectives of this review.\n\nTo describe the potential benefits and harms of NIs for influenza in all age groups by reviewing all clinical study reports of published and unpublished randomised, placebo-controlled trials and regulatory comments.\n\nWe included evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) testing the effects of NIs for prophylaxis, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and treatment of influenza. Prophylaxis is the mode of use of NIs when there is expectation of possible near-future exposure to influenza. PEP is the use of NIs following probable exposure to influenza but before symptoms develop. Treatment is the use of NIs in persons showing probable signs of influenza. Due to discrepancies between published and unpublished reports of the same trials, we decided to include only those trials for which we had unabridged clinical study reports (for example, with consecutively numbered pages), even though they may be parts of clinical study reports (i.e. Module 1 only) and information on reports of trials that were considered \"pivotal\" (i.e. first or secondline evidence to regulators in support of the registration application).\n\nWe included previously healthy people (children and adults). 'Previously healthy' includes people with chronic illness (such as asthma, diabetes, hypertension), but excludes people with illnesses with more significant effects on the immune system (such as malignancy or HIV infection). We included only trials on people exposed to naturally occurring influenza with or without symptoms. We targeted the intention-to-treat (ITT) and safety populations as our prior review discovered compelling evidence that the intention-to-treat-influenza-infected (ITTI), the sub-population deemed to be influenza-infected, were not balanced between treatment groups in the Roche oseltamivir trials. In addition, estimates from the ITT population will be more generalisable to clinical practice, where routine testing for influenza is not common in many countries (and even where used, remains of variable accuracy).\n\nNIs administered by any route compared with placebo during the period in which medication was assumed and during the followup (on-and off-treatment: on-t and off-t) periods. 1 . Influenza (symptomatic and asymptomatic, always with laboratory confirmation) and influenza-like illness (ILI) 2. Hospitalisation and complications 3. Interruption of transmission (in its two components, reduction of viral spread from index cases and prevention of onset of influenza in contacts) 4 . Harms 1. Drug resistance 2. Viral excretion 3. Mortality Whilst overall symptom reduction is well documented, our interest was particularly focused on complications and adverse events, as this is where evidence is currently scarce or inconclusive (Jefferson 2009a ; Shun-Shin 2009). Our preliminary examination of some regulatory documents and some published versions of the studies had identified that some symptoms and sequelae of influenza (such as pneumonia) had been classified as either a 'complication of influenza' or as an 'adverse event of the treatment', or both. This is somewhat confusing and we intended to analyse 'compliharms' (see Glossary, Appendix 1) irrespective of the classification as a 'complication of influenza' or as an 'adverse event of the treatment' (Appendix 3) in oseltamivir trials. Complications of particular interest included pneumonia, bronchitis, otitis media and sinusitis as these were the secondary illnesses often collected in the Roche oseltamivir trials and we agreed that these events are clinically important. Initially we constructed a table to illustrate the design methodology used for each complication by study ( Table  1 ). The table included the following variables: definition of which events are termed complications; where complications are first defined in the clinical study report; diagnosis method; and availability of data. We then stratified our analysis by method of diagnosis with three possible criteria: (1) laboratory-confirmed diagnosis (e.g. based on radiologically or microbiologically confirmed evidence of infection); (2) clinical diagnosis without laboratory confirmation (diagnosed by a doctor after a clinical examination); (3) other type of diagnosis such as self reported by patient. We conducted analysis of any complication (pneumonia, bronchitis, otitis media and sinusitis) that was classified as serious or led to study withdrawal. In all cases of influenza complications reporting (pneumonia, bronchitis, sinusitis, otitis media) there is a variable degree of participant self reporting, of investigator mediation (for example, in writing down the details in the case report form) and lack of verification with investigations such as culture or imaging. The 'self reported, investigator-mediated, unverified' title is relevant to all complications but for brevity we use it as sparingly as possible. For harms we were limited by the frequency of occurrence of the adverse events collected in the trials. Consequently we meta-analysed (1) all serious adverse events; (2) all adverse events leading to study withdrawal; (3) all withdrawals; (4) all adverse events within a clinical study report's defined body system; as well as (5) a small group of common adverse events as defined in the FDA drug label for oseltamivir. There were too few events to meta-analyse (1) deaths; (2) serious adverse events by body system; and (3) any events that had an overall incidence of less than 0.5%. We did not meta-analyse outcomes with fewer than 10 events in total. We conducted analyses separately for on-treatment and off-treatment periods. However, in two cases where (on-treatment) treatment effects were borderline statistically significant (prophylaxis with oseltamivir: renal body system on-treatment and psychiatric body system on-treatment), we conducted additional analysis combining on-and off-treatment periods to maximise statistical power. We conducted dose-response harms analysis for two treatment trials (WV15670 and WV15671) combined and one prophylaxis study (WV15673/WV15697), as these trials investigated the active agent at multiple doses. These studies included standard-dose and high-dose oseltamivir arms. For these analyses we used logistic regression, adjusting for study effects if appropriate (i.e. for the two treatment trials) and testing for trend using a likelihood ratio test. We tested the hypothesis that increased dose of drug leads to increased incidence of adverse effects.\n\nTo identify trials in the manufacturer-funded clinical trial programmes for NIs, as well as non-manufacturer-funded clinical trials of NIs, we used a variety of methods applied to a variety of sources from the literature, manufacturers and from regulatory bodies. These methods, as well as our methodology for identifying and obtaining relevant clinical study reports, are detailed in Appendix 4, Appendix 5 and Appendix 6.\n\nWe used electronic searches to identify trials not identified by the methods outlined in Appendix 4, particularly for non-manufacturer-funded clinical trials. See Appendix 5 for details. For the 2012 review, we updated our searches of the electronic databases of published studies that were previously carried out for the Cochrane reviews on NIs in children (Matheson 2007) and healthy adults ( Jefferson 2010a) , and then updated the searches again on 22 July 2013.\n\nFor the description of our searches for regulatory information (FDA, EMA, Roche, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA)), see Appendix 6.\n\nCollection and inventory of the evidence base was facilitated by the tools specifically developed for the review (Appendix 7). The overall risk of bias is presented graphically in Figure 1 and summarised in Figure 2 . \n\nFor this 2013 review, two authors (PD, TJ) reapplied the inclusion criteria for the oseltamivir clinical study reports and resolved disagreements by discussion. Two review authors (ES, IO) applied the criteria for the zanamivir clinical study reports while one review author (CH) arbitrated. For the procedures followed in the 2012 review, see Appendix 8 and Appendix 9.\n\nThe sizeable quantity of available data led us to subdivide the extraction, appraisal and analysis of the data into a two-stage exercise. In Stage 1 we assessed the reliability and completeness of the identified trial data. We decided to include in Stage 2 of the review (full analysis following standard Cochrane methods) only data that satisfied the following three criteria. 1. Completeness. Clinical study reports/unpublished reports include both identifiable CONSORT statement-specified methods to enable replication of the study. Identifiable CONSORT statement-specified results (primary outcomes, tables, appendices) must be available.\n\n2. Internal consistency. All parts (for example, denominators) of the same clinical study reports/unpublished report are broadly consistent.\n\n3. External consistency. Consistency of data as reported in regulatory documents, other versions of the same clinical study reports/unpublished reports and other references, to be established by cross-checking. This was a different approach to that used in the previous version of the current review (Jefferson 2012 ), since we only had incomplete information at that time and only applied the second and third criteria.\n\nFor details of the use of the CONSORT-based extraction template and the assessment for Stage 1 inclusion in the A159 (Jefferson 2012) review, see Appendix 7. In this review assessment for inclusion in Stage 1 was part of the inclusion procedure.\n\nIn Stage 2, one review author extracted data and a second review author checked it. We extracted data onto standard forms, checked and recorded it.\n\nWe used regulatory information to assess the possible correlation between citation frequency of oseltamivir treatment trials in the FDA regulatory documents and trial size.\n\nAfter publication of the A159 protocol in December 2010, but before validation of our CONSORT-based extractions in the Northern Hemisphere spring of 2011, we decided to carry out analyses (which we called post-protocol analyses) to test five null hypotheses that we had formulated while reading, summarising and reconstructing the clinical study reports. The hypotheses originated from our observations of discrepancies and other unexpected observations in the clinical study reports' data and were informed by reading regulatory information. Appendix 10 reports the rationale, methods to formulate and test, and the results of the hypotheses. The hypotheses reflect the uncertainty prevailing in the evidence base at a time when full clinical study reports were not available for all studies.\n\nPrevious studies comparing regulatory with published or internal company sources of evidence have reported a variety of different biases that affect medical knowledge (Chou 2005; MacLean 2003; McGauran 2010; Wieseler 2013). We will report in detail elsewhere our comments on using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool (Higgins 2011) to appraise clinical study reports and for trial programmes, and our efforts to construct an instrument for assessing risk of bias in complete clinical study reports. A full description of the methods used to quantify biases will be published in another paper.\n\nTo estimate treatment effects we first calculated the risk ratios (RRs) and used the average (mean) control event rate and the pooled RRs reported in the figures to calculate the risk differences (RD). For consistency we adopted this method for both the 'Summary of findings' tables and for the RDs reported in the text. For the analysis we chose to report the RRs as they are more consistent across the studies, and we have reported the heterogeneity for the pooled RR. We reinterpreted the results using the RD as this result is applicable to clinical decision-making. We calculated mean differences (MDs) for time to first alleviation of symptoms. For time to first alleviation of symptoms we also estimated the treatment effect as the percentage reduction in the average time to first alleviation of symptoms in the placebo group. Most zanamivir clinical study reports only reported treatment effects in terms of medians in each treatment group as well as P values from a hypothesis test comparing the time-to-event distributions. These data are insufficient for conducting meta-analysis. However, often sufficient time-to-event data were reported to allow us to estimate restricted means and standard deviations. Restricted means are based on the maximum time reported where alleviation occurred. There were some patients where alleviation was censored at the maximum follow-up time, therefore restricted means are under-estimates of the true means. However, the proportion of patients censored was generally low and similar in both treatment arms, hence this limitation is unlikely to have led to bias. The length of follow-up varied across trials and this has led to high variation in the estimated means and standard deviations (SDs) across trials. A post hoc analysis was undertaken after we discovered seven zanamivir trials provided data on time to first alleviation of symptoms with and without relief medication. Each patient in the studies may or may not have taken relief medication during the trial. Alleviation of symptoms may have occurred while the patient was taking relief medication and the \"standard\" comparison was made using this scenario. However, an additional analysis used a stricter definition where alleviation of symptoms could only be achieved without the use of relief medication. For example, a patient may have achieved alleviation using relief medication after five days but took seven days to achieve alleviation without the use of relief medication. The comparison we reported is for all patients where we used the stricter definition for the zanamivir group (alleviation without relief medication) and the less strict definition for the placebo group (alleviation with relief medication). We planned to use the tri-dimensional dose-relatedness, timing and patient susceptibility (DoTS) methodology to assess the likelihood of harms causality (Aronson 2003) , but the quality of the data available did not allow for this.\n\nProblems with unit of analysis are described in the 'Risk of bias' and 'Post-protocol hypotheses' sections.\n\nWe developed a comprehensive strategy for dealing with data that we know are missing at the trial level, i.e. unpublished trials (see Search methods for identification of studies section and Appendix 4, Appendix 5 and Appendix 6) and unreliable published records, which are a very concentrated summary of clinical study reports. For example, in the oseltamivir trial programme, some trials' clinical study reports (e.g. WP16263) consist of 8545 pages. This has a 1000-fold greater length compared to its published version (Dutkowski 2010), which consists of seven pages. The purpose of this review is to provide as complete a picture as possible of trial programmes, without reliance on the published literature. Appendix 11 reports an example of the content of a typical Roche clinical study report.\n\nWe used Tau 2 (inverse variance method) and the I 2 statistic to estimate between-study variance as measures of the level of statistical heterogeneity and the Chi 2 test to test for heterogeneity.\n\nWe carried out assessment of reporting biases (comparing clinical study report with the relevant publication) only in the first publication of A159. For this version, as we had complete clinical study reports for the trial programmes of the two drugs, we expected to find all relevant information in these documents and adopted a binary assessment (high risk, low risk or unclear bias).\n\nWe used the random-effects approach of DerSimonian and Laird based on MDs for analysis of time to first alleviation of symptoms. For all other outcomes we used the random-effects approach for binary data of DerSimonian and Laird, where Tau 2 was estimated using the inverse variance method. Whilst overall symptom reduction is well documented, our interest was particularly focused on complications and adverse events, as this is where evidence is currently scarce or inconclusive (Jefferson 2009a ; Matheson 2007; Shun-Shin 2009). Our preliminary examination of clinical study reports identified that some symptoms and sequelae of influenza (such as \"pneumonia\") had been classified as either a 'complication of influenza' or as an 'adverse event of the treatment' or both. We called this somewhat confusing classification 'compliharms'. We decided to deal with compliharms as follows. We identified complications of particular clinical interest as \"pneumonia\", bronchitis, otitis media and sinusitis. We tabulated the type of data capture used for each complication (\"secondary illness\") by study including the following variables: definition of what events are termed complications, which part of the clinical study report captured data on complications, who reported and captured the data, which diagnostic method was used, whether and where the diagnostic pathway was (usually a form) and whether prescription for treatment were captured. We then aimed to stratify our analysis by method of diagnosis with three possible criteria: (1) laboratory-confirmed diagnosis (e.g. based on radiological-or microbiologically-confirmed evidence of infection); (2) clinical diagnosis without laboratory-confirmation (diagnosed by a doctor/investigator after a clinical examination); (3) other type of diagnosis such as self-reported by patient. We also conducted analysis of any complication (such as \"pneumonia\", bronchitis, otitis media and sinusitis) that was classified as serious or led to study withdrawal.\n\nWe tested the effects of oseltamivir in prophylaxis of influenza and influenza-like illness. However the clinical study reports of prophylaxis trials do not define influenza-like illness but report eight different definitions for influenza with laboratory-confirmation (see web extra influenza definitions). This is a complex and confusing set of definitions where, for example, the definition for Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI) with systemic disturbance is the same as one of the definitions for asymptomatic influenza. After discovering the absence of a definition for influenza-like illness and the complex and confusing definitions for laboratory-confirmed influenza, we classified influenza-like illness as two or more symptoms from the following: nasal congestion, headache, chills/sweats, sore throat, cough, fatigue, myalgia and fever. These were the symptoms reported in the efficacy listing of individual patients in Module 3 of the prophylaxis trials clinical study reports. In two oseltamivir treatment trials (WV15670; WV15671) and one prophylaxis study (WV15673/WV15697) there were three treatment arms comparing placebo, standard dose and high dose. For time to first alleviation of symptoms we restricted comparison to placebo versus standard dose (as this is how it was reported in the original report). However, for all other outcomes we combined the standard and high-dose treatment arms. There was little apparent difference in the incidence of outcomes between the standard and high-dose arms and combining the arms did not appear to cause heterogeneity. However, in two cases there was some evidence of a dose-response effect. These cases are described more fully in the Results section under 'Analysis of harms'. The majority of zanamivir trials compared placebo with inhaled zanamivir. However, some trials also included an intranasal zanamivir treatment arm and a combined arm of inhaled and intranasal treatment. The multiple zanamivir arms were generally combined for meta-analysis as effects appeared similar and did not appear to cause heterogeneity.\n\nWe investigated the robustness of complications outcomes using subgroup analysis by method of diagnosis. We investigated high estimates of heterogeneity, where possible, using subgroup analysis. For example, we conducted subgroup analysis of time to first alleviation of symptoms in studies of oseltamivir treatment in children by partitioning studies into those of otherwise healthy children and those of children with chronic illness (asthma). Based on a referee's comment, we conducted a subgroup analysis on time to first alleviation of symptoms by infection status for zanamivir. We could not do a similar analysis for oseltamivir because we did not have data on the non-influenza-infected patients and we could not correctly identify the patients with influenza infection due to the effect of oseltamivir on antibodies. In the trial programmes for both oseltamivir and zanamivir there was large variation in treatment effects for pneumonia across the populations studied (i.e. adults and children as well as treatment and prophylaxis), hence we conducted meta-regression to investigate this heterogeneity. We included all studies that reported pneumonia (32 studies in total) and investigated the four binary factors: age group (adults versus children); drug (oseltamivir versus zanamivir); indication (treatment versus prophylaxis) and method of diagnosis. For oseltamivir studies, the method of diagnosis was either based on data collected on non-specific adverse events or secondary/intercurrent illness forms or data collected on specific \"diagnosis of secondary illness\" forms that included objective criteria such as X-ray confirmation. For zanamivir, two trials included X-ray confirmation of pneumonia. We conducted metaregression in Stata/SE, version 13 for Windows using the metareg command. There were some studies where one treatment group had zero events, therefore we added 0.5 events to all treatment groups for all studies prior to analysis. The dependent variable in the regression was log relative risk. A further post hoc analysis was undertaken after we discovered seven trials provided data on time to first alleviation of symptoms with and without relief medication. Each patient in the studies may or may not have taken relief medication during the trial. Alleviation of symptoms may have occurred while the patient was taking relief medication and the \"standard\" comparison was made using this scenario. However, an additional analysis used a stricter definition where alleviation of symptoms could only be achieved without the use of relief medication. For example, a patient may have achieved alleviation using relief medication after five days but took seven days to achieve alleviation without the use of relief medication. The comparison we reported is for all patients where we used the stricter definition for the zanamivir group (alleviation without relief medication) and the less strict definition for the placebo group (alleviation with relief medication).\n\nSensitivity analyses applicable to our post-protocol analyses have been covered earlier in the Methods section of this review. We used the fixed-effect method of Mantel and Haenszel as a sensitivity analysis to supplement our primary analyses using the randomeffects method of DerSimonian and Laird. Random-effects metaanalysis is known to be overly conservative with sparse data. Hence we conducted sensitivity analysis using Peto's method on two occasions where we had sparse data and borderline statistically significant results (prophylaxis with oseltamivir: renal body system on-treatment and psychiatric body system on-treatment).\n\nWe searched trial registries, electronic databases and regulatory archives, corresponded with manufacturers to identify all trials and requested clinical study reports. Although this review focuses on the primary data sources of manufacturers, we checked that there were no published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from non-manufacturer sources by running electronic searches in the following databases: \n\nWe were able to download 2673 pages from the FDA website. The table of contents is in Table 2 , Table 3 , Table 4 and Table 5 . We used these pages to identify all trials that had been conducted within a drug's trial programme. There was no correlation between citation frequency of oseltamivir treatment trials in the FDA regulatory documents and trial size. The biggest treatment trial (M76001) is cited only four times in three documents, while other contemporary treatment trials are cited far more (WV15670; WV15671; WV15730; WV15812/WV15872; WV15707). WV15670, for example, is cited 46 times in the FDA documents. However, the combined enrolled denominator of the four treatment trials completed at the time (WV15670; WV15671; WV15707; WV15730) was 1442, smaller than M76001 (1459). This suggested that the FDA's regulatory evaluation of Roche's New Drug Application was based predominantly on what Roche had offered them as \"pivotal\" or trials that best demonstrated the properties of oseltamivir, not the complete evidence base of all oseltamivir trials. One possible alternative explanation for this observation could have been the interval between trial completion, generation of the report and New Drug Applications (NDA) submission. This explanation is supported by the relatively brief interval between completion of the M76001 trial (19 February 1999) and sub-mission (on 30 April 1999) of NDA 021087 to the FDA. However, the core part of the submission (the clinical development programme) contains data from two (at the time) ongoing trials (WV15819/WV15876/WV15978; WV15812/WV15872). The basis of the selection of trials to regulators is therefore unclear but appears to be dictated by criteria other than availability and size. The importance of trials (to manufacturers and possibly to regulators) may not be based on the same criteria that systematic reviewers would use (i.e. the capability of the trial to answer questions). Due to the vast size of FDA documents, sometimes hundreds of pages long, it was difficult to determine important emerging themes solely by reading. To identify items of interest in the FDA comments we used word clouds (Feinberg 2009). Word clouds give greater prominence to words that appear more frequently in the source document. The resulting graphic representation showed words such as 'diary' and 'baseline' to be heavily mentioned in the relevant (abridged) text from the FDA's Medical Officer Review (FDA 1999c, PDF page 19) . Examining the 'diary' entry in more detail, we found the following FDA comment: \"The majority of subjects participating in the treatment trials had only used the first diary card. The second diary card was issued in 15% to 20% of participants. In response to FDA's request, the applicant provided a summary of diary card dispensing in the 8/6/99 submission. It became apparent that instructions on when to start a second diary card were not uniformly followed in WV15670, WV15671, and WV15730 trials. There were examples of patients who had alleviated symptoms yet also received a second diary card. Conversely, there were also examples of patients who did not alleviate all symptoms but did not receive a second diary card. Thus the second diary card was used inconsistently which is viewed as a flaw of these trials. The lack of consistency in collecting symptom information after alleviation precluded a complete documentation of symptom fluctuation. Also missing second diary cards in subjects who had not alleviated symptoms were responsible for the majority of censored data which may have potentially influenced the results of efficacy analysis. In order to address the impact of censoring, the applicant performed several sensitivity analyses which will be summarized in the Integrated Summary of Efficacy\". This comment highlights problems with the follow-up procedure of treatments trials, which may have impaired the regulator's ability to draw conclusions on the duration of effect of oseltamivir. It also provides a good example of how graphic methods can help identify crucial comments in vast regulatory files. Several other experiments with text from the same FDA document showed that the choice of text to be represented as a Word cloud heavily influenced cloud construction, visibility of words and hence our ability to detect important comments. It is for this reason that we decided to adopt a mixed approach: mapping citations while reading FDA comments and integrating such comments in our appraisal of the evidence. Regulatory comments were all the more important, because at the time we developed this method we had few clinical study reports and comments helped to identify the gaps in our knowledge of the trial programmes. Once the table of contents had been constructed, we postulated that given the huge work involved in reviewing lots of regulatory files, our new instrument could also help us by indicating which parts were more important than others, thus focusing our efforts. We experimented with a variety of methods reported in the Data collection and analysis section.\n\nAfter prolonged correspondence and media pressure (Appendix 2), we were able to access the trial programmes for both oseltamivir and zanamivir without clauses restricting their accessibility to third parties.\n\nTwo review authors (CDM, MT) independently scanned the titles and abstracts of the electronic searches. Three identified studies ( NCT00980109; NCT01032837; JPRN-JapicCTI-111647) were published versions of trials possibly unknown to us. We wrote to the first trial author to ask for clinical study reports or equivalent on 12 November 2013 who confirmed that the trials had not been completed.\n\nThe absence of documentation of trial programmes for both drugs, listing all sponsored trials completed or underway, meant we had to rely on a variety of sources for the reconstruction of the trial programmes and identification of relevant clinical study reports. This complexity is reflected in the flowchart presented in Figure  3 , illustrating the study selection process for this review. The two main pathways were the spontaneous release of 77 full clinical study reports by Roche (long after our request for 36 of them) and the requests to regulatory authorities and GSK for all the relevant reports.\n\ndrugs listing all sponsored trials completed or underway, we had to rely on a variety of sources for the reconstruction of the trial programmes and retrieval of relevant clinical study reports. This complexity is reflected in the flowchart, illustrating the study selection process for this review. The two main pathways were the spontaneous release of 77 clinical full clinical study reports by Roche and the requests to regulatory authorities and GSK for all the relevant reports. There was overlap in trial reports retrieved following the different pathways\n\nWe carried out the inclusion into Stage 1 using the clinical study reports, titles, abstracts and any other relevant information. Through this process we identified 208 potentially relevant studies (139 oseltamivir trials, 61 zanamivir trials and eight peramivir trials NAIB3001; NAIB3002; PE-01) were included in Stage 1. It was not uncommon for more than one trial to be reported in the same clinical study reports. This was either due to the amalgamation of two or more trials because of low influenza virus circulation and difficulties in recruitment (for example, WV15812/WV15872), or because the trials bore different ID numbers when in reality they followed the same protocol, albeit in two different hemispheres (for example, WV15759/WV15871). We also identified six completed or ongoing studies of peramivir in dose-response or placebo-controlled studies (NCT00419263; NCT00453999; NCT00486980; NCT00610935; NCT00705406; NCT00958776). The included trials were predominantly conducted in adults during influenza seasons in both hemispheres. A small number of studies were conducted in older people residing in care homes and in people with underlying respiratory diseases. All trials were sponsored by the manufacturers.\n\nOf the 23 oseltamivir trials in Stage 1, 15 were multicentre trials conducted in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, while eight were done in only one country (USA five, Japan two and China one). In total 9623 participants were included (6574 in treatment trials and 3049 in prophylaxis trials). The age of the participants ranged from 1 to 82 years and the duration of followup varied from 6 to 42 days. Two of the trials were conducted within nursing homes; 20 were within free-living populations; one was performed in in-and outpatient departments. Three trials were conducted in children, while participants in 20 trials were adults. In some trials the eligible population included participants at increased risk of influenza complications, or with diagnoses of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but the majority included only otherwise healthy adults. In one trial (WV15730), participants were stratified by smoking status, while those in another trial were stratified by the presence or absence of otitis media (WV15758). All trials compared orally administered oseltamivir (either as capsules or reconstituted powder) with placebo. Of the 23 trials, we included 20 RCTs for the analysis examining the use of oseltamivir compared with placebo. Two were excluded from the meta-analysis because they were only synopsis reports (JV15823; JV15824) and another because it was not a full clinical study report (ML16369). We finally included 20 oseltamivir trials into Stage 2: 11 on treatment in adults (M76001; WV15670; WV15671; WV15707, WV15730;\n\nWV15812/WV15872; WV15819/WV15876/WV15978 WV16277), four in children (NV16871; WV15758; WV15759/WV15871), and five on prophylaxis: two in adults (WV15673/WV15697), two in the elderly (WV15708; WV15825) and one in households (WV15799). Of the 15 included treatment trials of oseltamivir only three (M76001; WV15670; WV15758) were successful in recruiting the a priori planned sample size.\n\nOf the 28 included zanamivir trials, 18 were multicentre trials done in both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere and 10 were done in only one country (Japan five, USA three, Finland and Germany one each). In total 14,628 participants were included (7678 in treatment trials and 6950 in prophylaxis trials). Participants' age ranged from 5 to 12 years to over 65 and duration of follow-up varied from 5 to 35 days. Two of the trials were performed within nursing homes; several were within free-living populations; one was performed within a university student population. In some trials the eligible population included participants at increased risk of influenza complications, or with diagnoses of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but the majority included only adults who were otherwise healthy. Zanamivir was administered as an intranasal spray, an inhalation or a combination of both and placebos were designed to match. Administration was by the participant in the majority of trials and by nursing staff in the trials within nursing homes. Twentytwo trials compared inhaled zanamivir with placebo and six trials compared inhaled zanamivir, or intranasal zanamivir, with placebo or usual care. Of the 28 trials we included 26 RCTs for the analysis examining the use of zanamivir compared with placebo. Two were excluded from the meta-analysis because one was only a synopsis (NAI30020) and one compared zanamivir to usual care and not placebo (NAIA3003). We finally included 26 zanamivir trials: 14 on treatment in adults (JNAI-01; JNAI-04; JNAI-07, NAI30008; NAI30011; NAI30012; NAI30015; NAIA/B2008; NAIA2005; NAIA3002; NAIB2005; NAIB2007; NAIB3001; NAIB3002), two in children (NAI30009; NAI30028) and 10 trials in prophylaxis (167-101; NAI30034; NAIA/B2009; NAIA2006; NAIA3004; NAIA3005; NAIB2006; PE-01; NAI30010; NAI30031). Our attempt at collecting sufficient information from regulatory files to reconstruct missing clinical study reports also failed because the information appeared insufficient for a reliable reconstruction.\n\nWe excluded 123 studies from entering Stage 1 for various reasons. Some were pharmacokinetic studies, or had an active comparator, or compared higher-versus lower-dose schedules, or were ongoing trials. A further 19 trials are awaiting assessment (Characteristics of studies awaiting classification).\n\nStudy level assessments are reported in the 'Risk of bias' tables. To address the problem of reporting bias, we ignored published trial reports and directed our attention to clinical study reports and regulatory information. Our problems in reviewing the copious material at our disposal were how to identify and analyse important details in the midst of thousands of pages of information and how to construct a coherent appraisal of large and complex trial programmes. In addition, since we gained unrestricted access to the full clinical study reports (apart from personal de-identifying redactions) we took the view that all information needed to judge risk of bias should be present. Therefore when this information was not available, we judged the corresponding risk of bias element as at 'high' risk of bias. For example, when details of the random sequence generation are missing from journal publications of clinical trials, it is customary to record this as \"unknown\" risk of bias. This judgment usually carries the assumption that the random sequence generation details are available in more detailed reports. But when these details were still missing in even full clinical study reports, we chose to rate this risk of bias element at \"high\" risk of bias. In the following paragraphs we report some of the salient findings using the current Cochrane format but applying the logic of reviewing regulatory data.\n\nIn 10 of the 20 oseltamivir studies included in Stage 2 the description of random sequence generation is missing. The reporting of all zanamivir trials but one (NAI30028) was biased by the absence of description of random sequence generation.\n\nThe placebo and active drug capsule cap were not identical in 11 of the 20 trials of oseltamivir. This may have compromised blinding of participants. For all but one of the zanamivir trials we did not have the certificates of analysis to enable us to reconstruct the appearance, taste and texture of the two principles.\n\nIn addition to the missing diary cards in three treatment trials (see Results of the search section), we were unable to identify all data for all outcomes in all oseltamivir trials and in eight of the zanamivir trials. For example, hospitalisations were not reported in zanamivir trials and inconsistently reported in oseltamivir trials. The relevant data in this review come from a table of hospitalisations sent to us by Roche in late 2013. In addition, in some trials we were unable to track individual participants through tables, narratives and individual listings. The issue of compliharms impeded the ascertainment of harms in oseltamivir treatment trials (Appendix 1). We had difficulty in following the logic of compliharms, even with access to full clinical study reports. The definition of adverse events in the RCTs of oseltamivir and zanamivir is different from the ordinary definition of the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) E2D guideline, which is as follows: \"An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (for example, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to this medicinal product\". ( http://www.ich.org/fileadmin/Public Web Site/ICH Products/ Guidelines/Efficacy/E2D/Step4/E2D Guideline.pdf accessed 27 December 2013).\n\nAs an example, the definition of adverse events in the WV15671 study is as follows (PDF page 35): \"following the alleviation of influenza-like symptoms, the recurrence of a single respiratory or constitutional symptom was recorded as an adverse event, however, the reappearance of more than one symptom was recorded as influenza-like syndrome (i.e. secondary illness) and therefore do not appear as adverse events\" and WV15670: \"any adverse change from the subject's baseline (pre-treatment) condition, which occurred during the course of the study after treatment had started, whether considered related to treatment or not\". Treatment included all investigational agents (including placebo and comparative agents) administered during the course of the study)\" (our emphasis). As a consequence, adverse events that are similar to the symptoms of influenza (such as headache and mild gastrointestinal adverse events) tend to be excluded from the treatment trials.\n\nWe identified a report of a site inspection for the adult prophylaxis trial WV15673/WV15697. The FDA carried out the inspection in September 2000 at various trial sites in the US including the West Virginia site (which was responsible for enrolling many hundreds of participants). An FDA official letter reported several violations including failure to report serious harms to the sponsor (Roche) as the protocol required and in addition stated: \"... we view the statement in the payment section of the consent form used in the study that subjects '...will receive $300.00 for participating in and completing the study. No payment will be made to you if you withdraw from the study for personal reasons...' to be an improper procedure. When subjects are to be paid for participating in a study, the payment should be prorated for the subject's actual participation in the study in order to avoid the possibility of coercion\" (FDA 2000e, PDF page 177). However, the FDA allowed the data (which had been published a year earlier in a prime journal) to stand in support of Roche's application for the prophylaxis indication. We do not know whether the participant contract was standard (i.e. whether the observation of possible improper procedures could be generalised to other sites and other trials), but the document cited by the FDA inspector is the subject of one of our (as yet unfulfilled) Freedom of Information (FOI) requests. The possibility of financial pressure, if confirmed, could seriously confound drop-out rates because of harms or any other causes in prophylaxis trials. The significantly higher incidence of diarrhoea in placebo recipients of treatment trial WV15671 was identified by the FDA reviewers who remarked \"Diarrhea was reported more frequently among subjects receiving placebo than among subjects receiving Ro 64-0796 [oseltamivir] . Diarrhoea, although not specified as an inclusion criterion, has been documented to be a clinical manifestation of influenza infection. The reduction in the incidence of diarrhoea for the treatment groups compared with the placebo group could be considered as a possible treatment effect of Ro 64-0796\" (FDA 1999c). However, according to the Japanese Summary Basis for Approval (JSBA) of oseltamivir capsules for prophylaxis, diarrhoea was reported more frequently in the oseltamivir arm (49/986) than in the placebo group (38/973) in the summarised table of adverse events from three trials (WV15673/WV15697; WV15708; WV15825). Our findings are inconsistent with the explanation by the FDA.\n\nAll oseltamivir trials and almost half of the zanamivir trials had selected reporting. The oseltamivir trials showed a consistent trend of missing original protocols (except for M76001), changing outcome definitions while the trial was running, protocol amendments even after the trial had been completed, inconsistent approaches to outcome data collection, missing statistical analysis plans, missing date of unblinding and the use of self reported outcomes such as pneumonia (M76001; WV15670; WV15671; WV15707; WV15730; WV16277). This represent 55% of pneumonia event data. As an example, in trial WV15670, secondary illnesses were patient reported. The body of the clinical study report states that complications requiring antibiotic treatment were specified a priori but even in the final version of the protocol, for which we have the full text, there is no predefined list of secondary illnesses (i.e. no mention of pneumonia, bronchitis, sinusitis or otitis in the protocol), nor did complications have anything to do with antibiotic treatment according to the protocol, nor does the Case Report Form mention specific secondary illnesses by name. Zanamivir trials reported outcomes not specified in the protocol provided. We found evidence of possible selective reporting bias when we analysed the JSBA data on prophylaxis. The regulatory data reports tables for individual trials as well as 10 pages of summarised tables for three trials of prophylaxis (WV15673/WV15697; WV15708; WV15825). Tables for individual trials include data for high-dose arms but report few psychiatric adverse events overall. However, the summarised tables list a variety of psychiatric adverse events including psychotic and suicidal adverse events, but not adverse events from the high-dose group. As a preliminary exploratory analysis, we combined the following suspected serious adverse events collectively: hallucination and delusion that are classified grade 3 (serious) by the National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria Version 2.0 (NCI-CTC V2.0), psychosis (hallucination and delusion are the two major symptoms of this disease), suicidal attempt that is classified grade 3 (serious) by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0 (CTCAE V4.0) and hostility that includes aggression, hostility, violence, murder and commonly considered as serious events though not listed in the NCI-CTC V2.0 or CTCAE V4.0. Numbers of suspected serious psychotic/suicidal adverse events (including hallucination, psychosis, schizophrenia, paranoia, aggression/hostility and attempted suicide) were five in the oseltamivir group and zero in the placebo group during the on-treatment period. When the off-treatment period data are added the total was eight versus one. The prophylaxis programme is crucial in understanding the harms profile of the drug as the potential for harms witnessed to be confounded by the apparently numerous symptoms and signs of influenza infection is far less, as many participants do not become infected with influenza. This makes a causality assessment more straightforward.\n\nAll but three of the oseltamivir treatment trials were under-recruited. Several of the zanamivir trials were also under-recruited. We noted the use of different relief medication across different centres within the same trial and in one zanamivir trial (NAI30031), according to the protocol participants receiving antibiotics for bacterial respiratory tract infection should have been excluded but in the trial this did not happen. In the zanamivir trial NAI30034, the definition of \"confirmed influenza\" was amended after protocol closure. We also noted several other items that were not included in all full clinical study reports:\n\n\u2022 Study protocols dated prior to participant enrolment (missing for many oseltamivir trials).\n\n\u2022 Certificates of analysis for the intervention/placebo preparations.\n\n\u2022 Patient enrolment dates explicitly reported (only trial inception and cessation dates are given; in zanamivir trials these are partially redacted).\n\n\u2022 Explicitly reported date of trial unblinding. We frequently noted the statement \"the database was authorized on xxxx\" to identify the unblinding date but an explicit date is important to report. In some cases, the date of unblinding was reported but the actual date within the month was redacted. This practice also applied to zanamivir protocol amendments.\n\n\u2022 Authorship and accountability for the writing of the clinical study reports.\n\n\u2022 Statistical analysis plans in some cases.\n\n\u2022 Patient consent forms (missing from most zanamivir trials).\n\n\u2022 Patient information form (missing from most zanamivir trials).\n\n\u2022 List of randomisation codes (variably included).\n\n\u2022 Case report form templates in zanamivir trials do not allow for determining who completes the form (patient or clinician).\n\n\u2022 Core data sheet.\n\nOther important documents that we did not have included:\n\n\u2022 Study manual of procedures.\n\n\u2022 Minutes of safety data monitoring committee meetings.\n\nThe placebo interventions in both sets of trials may have contained active substances. The placebo for zanamivir trials contained lac-tose powder, which can potentially cause bronchospasm, while the placebo for oseltamivir trials contained dehydrocholic acid and dibasic calcium phosphate dehydrate, which can cause gastrointestinal symptoms. Data on participants by influenza-infected status (in treatment trials) and for participants with influenza-like illness (in prophylaxis trials) were not reported in the oseltamivir clinical study reports. Finally, data on the effects of rescue or relief medication (mainly paracetamol/acetaminophen) were incomplete in clinical study reports of oseltamivir trials and not reported separately in all zanamivir trials.\n\nIn adult treatment, oseltamivir reduced the time to first alleviation of symptoms by 16.8 hours (95% confidence interval (CI) 8.4 to 25.1 hours, I 2 statistic = 0%), representing a 10% reduction from 7 days to 6.3 days (Analysis 1.1; Figure 4 ). There was no significant effect in asthmatic children: increased by 5.2 hours (95% CI 11.1 hours lower to 21.4 hours higher, I 2 statistic = 0%). But there was an effect in otherwise healthy children, based on one trial: 29 hours, 95% CI: 12 to 47 hours, P = 0.001). (Analysis 1.46). Zanamivir reduced time to first alleviation of symptoms in adults by 0.60 days (95% CI 0.39 to 0.81 days, I 2 statistic = 9%), which equates to a 14.4 hours (10%) reduction in symptoms from 6.6 days to 6.0 days (Analysis 3.1; Figure 5 ). There was no significant effect in children: time to first alleviation of symptoms was 1.08 days lower in the zanamivir group (95% CI 2.32 lower to 0.15 days higher, I 2 statistic = 72%) (Analysis 3.14). In eight zanamivir trials that reported on use of relief medication, in all participants the median days to alleviation in both the placebo and the treatment arms was less when compared to those who did not use relief medications (Table 6 ). In seven zanamivir trials, time to first alleviation of symptoms was also reported with and without rescue medication. Using these data we were able to compare zanamivir without rescue medication with placebo with rescue medication. Overall there was a non-significant 0.41 day decrease (95% CI 0.47 days lower to 1.29 days higher, I 2 statistic = 67%) in time to first alleviation of symptoms in the placebo with rescue medication group, suggesting that zanamivir itself is no better than rescue medication and possibly even less effective, although the varying levels of use of rescue medication in the seven trials did give rise to large heterogeneity (Analysis 3.68; Figure 6 ). In subgroup analysis of time to first alleviation of symptoms in adults by infection status, we found no evidence of a difference in treatment effect for zanamivir on the influenza-infected subgroup compared to the non-influenza-infected subgroup (P = 0.53). The treatment effect was 0.67 days (95% CI 0.35 to 0.99 days, I 2 statistic = 17%) for influenza-infected patients and 0.52 days (95% CI 0.18 to 0.86 days, I 2 statistic = 0%) for non-influenza-infected patients (Analysis 3.69).\n\nIn oseltamivir treatment of adults, there was no significant difference in hospitalisation rate between treatment groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.92, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.50, I 2 statistic = 0%) (Analysis 1.2), or in treatment of children (RR 1.92, 95% CI 0.70 to 5.23, I 2 statistic = 0%) (Analysis 1.47 ), with wide CIs; or in prophylaxis (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.94, I 2 statistic = 0%) (Analysis 2.7). Data on hospitalisations for the zanamivir studies were not reported.\n\nIn adult treatment trials, oseltamivir significantly reduced self reported, investigator-mediated, unverified pneumonia (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.90, I 2 statistic = 0%; risk difference (RD) 1.00%, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.49; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 100, 95% CI 67 to 451) in the treated population. The effect was significant in the six trials that collected data on non-specific adverse events or secondary/intercurrent illness forms (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.88, I 2 statistic = 0%; RD 0.99%, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.38; NNTB = 101, 95% CI 73 to 470). However, it was not significant in the five trials (two clinical study reports) that used more detailed diagnostic data collection forms, and in no studies that reported on radiological confirmation of pneumonia ( Figure 7 ; Analysis 1.17). There was no significant effect on pneumonia in children (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.83, I 2 statistic = 0%) (Analysis 1.52). In two zanamivir adult trials (NAI30012; NAI30015), pneumonia reporting was based on a stricter definition of X-ray confirmation and there was also no significant treatment effect (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.35 to 3.02, I 2 = 39%) (Analysis 3.3). In nine zanamivir trials (NAI30008; NAI30010; NAI30011; NAIA/B2008; NAIA2005; NAIA3002; NAIB2007; NAIB3001; NAIB3002), pneumonia was a self reported, investigator-mediated, unverified outcome ( Figure 8 ; Figure 9 ). Overall, there was no significant effect of zanamivir on mixed verified and unverified pneumonia in adult treatment (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.40, I 2 statistic = 0%) (Analysis 3.2). Analysis 4.5 shows that in prophylaxis trials, zanamivir reduced the risk of self reported, investigator-mediated, unverified pneumonia in adults (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.80, I 2 statistic = 0%; RD 0.32%, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.41; NNTB = 311, 95% CI 244 to 1086).\n\nIn meta-regression of 'pneumonia' based on 32 studies, treatment effects were not statistically different by age group (P = 0.22), drug (P = 0.89) or indication (P = 0.14). However, treatment effects were statistically different by method of diagnosis (P = 0.025). For unclear objective diagnosis of pneumonia, the treatment effect was RR 0.51 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.75, I 2 statistic = 0%), whereas for objective diagnosis data collection of pneumonia, the treatment effect was 1.01 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.47, I 2 statistic = 0%). A subgroup analysis of pneumonia for all 32 studies by method of diagnosis is shown in Analysis 5.1. Please note that estimates in the subgroup analysis are slightly different to those obtained in meta-regression due to the different methodologies.\n\nIn oseltamivir trials, treatment did not significantly affect complications classified as serious or those that led to withdrawal from the trial in adults (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.06, I 2 statistic = 0%) (Analysis 1.20) or in children (RR 1.98, 95% CI 0.58 to 6.72, I 2 statistic = 0%) (Analysis 1.55). This outcome could not be assessed in oseltamivir prophylaxis due to an insufficient number of events. There was no significant effect of zanamivir, in adult treatment, in reducing the risk of any complication classified as serious or which led to study withdrawal (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.63, I 2 statistic = 0%) (Analysis 3.7) or in prophylaxis (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.36 to 3.26, I 2 statistic = 0%) (Analysis 4.8). This outcome could not be assessed in children due to an insufficient number of events.\n\nNeither zanamivir (Analysis 4.6; Analysis 4.7) nor oseltamivir (Analysis 2.8; Analysis 2.9) significantly reduced the risk of bronchitis or sinusitis in prophylaxis trials. In adults, treatment with oseltamivir did not significantly reduce the risk of bronchitis (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.01, I 2 statistic = 36%) (Analysis 1. 16 , but did not reduce the risk of sinusitis (Analysis 3.5) or otitis media (Analysis 3.6). In children, zanamivir treatment did not significantly reduce the risk of sinusitis (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.12 to 6.45, I 2 statistic = 40%) (Analysis 3.17) or otitis media (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.72, I 2 statistic = 0%) (Analysis 3.18). See Table 1 for a summary of the methodology used for collecting and assessing complications in oseltamivir treatment trials. See Table 7 for the overall results for oseltamivir in adults and Table  8 for children. See Table 9 for the overall results for zanamivir in adults and Table 10 for children.\n\nSymptomatic influenza was lower in the oseltamivir arms compared to placebo in studies of prophylaxis (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.67, I 2 statistic = 0%; RD 3.05%, 95% CI 1.83 to 3.88; NNTB = 33, 95% CI 26 to 55) (Analysis 2.1); but there were no differences for all other influenza outcomes including overall influenzalike-illness reported as an adverse event on-treatment. In household prophylaxis, one small study with missing outcome data and selective reporting, including 405 participants, showed a significant reduction of symptomatic influenza in the oseltamivir arm compared to placebo (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.44; RD 13.6%, 95% CI 9.52 to 15.47) (Analysis 2.3), but in the same study there was no significant reduction in asymptomatic influenza (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.39 to 3.33) (Analysis 2.4). Asymptomatic influenza was not significantly reduced and there was no non-influenza, influenza-like illness reported throughout the study period.\n\nIn prophylaxis trials we could not analyse effects on influenza-like illness because of a lack of definition in the clinical study reports. However, using our definition (see methods), oseltamivir did not reduce influenza-like illness in participants (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.06). The Roche trial programme assessing the effects of oseltamivir in post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) submitted to the FDA on 22 May 2000 consisted of two trials: WV15799 and WV16139. We included only trial WV15799 because WV16139 was not placebo-controlled. WV15799 was a double-blind, cluster-randomised trial in which contact clusters of index cases were randomised to oseltamivir 75 mg a day or placebo for seven days. The manufacturer concluded that the trial proved that oseltamivir could prevent influenza in contacts by interrupting transmission from index cases. Interruption of transmission has two components: reduction of viral spread from index cases (measured by nasal shedding of influenza viruses) and prevention of onset of influenza in contacts measured with a mixture of symptoms and signs and 'laboratory confirmation' (i.e. viral culture from the upper airways and/or at least a four-fold rise in antibody titres measured between baseline and two to three weeks later). The design of the WV15799 is weak. All index cases were left untreated except for a paracetamol rescue pack, making it impossible to assess the effect of oseltamivir on nasal voidance of index cases. Nasal viral voidance was measured only in symptomatic participants thereby missing out on potential asymptomatic infected people. Zanamivir However, it did not reduce the risk of asymptomatic influenza in the prophylaxis of individuals (RR 0.97, 0.76 to 1.24, I 2 statistic = 0%) (Analysis 4.2) or asymptomatic individuals in post-exposure prophylaxis of households (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.20, I 2 statistic = 0%) (Analysis 4.4). See Table 11 for the overall results for oseltamivir in adults and Table 9 for children. See Table 12 and Table 13 for the overall results for zanamivir in adults and Table  14 for children.\n\nOseltamivir treatment\n\nOseltamivir in the treatment of adults is associated with increased risk of nausea (RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.15, I 2 statistic = 43%; RD 3.66%, 95% CI 0.90 to 7.39; number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) = 28, 95% CI 14 to 112) (Analysis 1.5) and vomiting (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.75 to 3.38, I 2 statistic = 12%; RD 4.56%, 95% CI 2.39 to 7.58; NNTH = 22, 95% CI 14 to 42) (Analysis 1.6). It is associated with a decreased risk of diarrhoea (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.98, I 2 statistic = 44%; RD 2.33%, 95% CI 0.14 to 3.81; NNTB = 43, 95% CI 27 to 709) (Analysis 1.7) when compared to placebo during on-treatment periods. Both nausea and vomiting were associated with significant heterogeneity where treatment effects appeared larger in otherwise healthy adults compared to the elderly and the chronically ill. However, one trial of otherwise healthy adults also showed smaller effects (WV16277). Vomiting was more common in those children on oseltamivir treatment compared to those on placebo (RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.35, I 2 statistic = 0%; RD 5.34%, 95% CI 1.75 to 10.29 ; NNTH = 19, 95% CI 10 to 57) (Analysis 1.63).\n\nThe cardiac effects of oseltamivir are unclear. Exposure to oseltamivir may reduce cardiac general events compared to placebo (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.97, I 2 statistic = 0%; RD 0.68%, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.00; NNTB = 148, 95% CI 101 to 2509), excluding WV16277 in which ECG was included in the safety parameters (Analysis 1.27). However, exposure to oseltamivir may increase QTc prolongation (including borderline) as reported in trial WV16277 (RD 4.0%, 95% CI 0.71 to 7.30; NNTH = 25, 95% CI 14 to 140) compared to placebo during on-treatment periods.\n\nIn treatment trials, there was no significant increase in risk between oseltamivir and on-treatment psychiatric adverse events overall (Analysis 1.32). However, there was a dose-response effect in the two \"pivotal\" treatment trials. In the identically designed trials WV15670 and WV15671 there were two active treatment groups: 150 mg (standard dose) and 300 mg (high dose) oseltamivir per day. In the dose-response analysis there was an increased risk of psychiatric body system adverse events over the entire follow-up period (P = 0.038 based on likelihood ratio test). In trial WV15670, the event rates were: 1/204, 1/206 and 4/205 in the placebo, 75 mg and 150 mg arms respectively, whereas trial WV15671 had rates of 2/235, 0/242 and 5/242, respectively.\n\nThe proportion of patients being diagnosed as influenza-infected in oseltamivir treatment of adults was significantly lower in the treated compared to the control group (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.99, I 2 statistic = 0%) (Analysis 1.3). The proportion of patients with four-fold increases in antibody titre was significantly lower in the treated group compared to the control group (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.97, I 2 statistic = 0%) (Analysis 1.4). This represents an absolute difference of 5% between treatment groups. There was a lower proportion of children on oseltamivir with a four-fold increase in antibodies (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00, I 2 statistic = 0%) (Analysis 1.49).\n\nIn oseltamivir prophylaxis, there was an increased risk of headaches on-treatment (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.33, I 2 statistic = 0%; RD 3.15%, 95% CI 0.88 to 5.78; NNTH = 32, (95% CI 18 to 115) (Analysis 2.19; Figure 10 ) and nausea on-treatment (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.20 to 3.20, I 2 statistic = 49%; RD 4.15%, 95% CI 0.86 to 9.51; NNTH = 25, 95% CI 11 to 116) (Analysis 2.20). There was also a dose-response effect for headaches in study WV15673/WV15697 (P = 0.013 based on likelihood ratio test), where on-treatment rates were: 202/519, 225/520 and 242/520 in the placebo, standard-dose and high-dose arms, respectively. Figure 11 (Analysis 2.54) shows that in prophylaxis trials of oseltamivir there was a significant increase in patients with psychiatric adverse events over the on-and off-treatment periods (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.08, I 2 statistic = 0%; RD 1.06%, 95% CI 0.07 to 2.76; NNTH = 94, 95% CI 36 to 1538). Initial analysis of patients with psychiatric adverse events in the on-treatment period showed a borderline statistically significant result (P = 0.06), hence we conducted sensitivity analysis using Peto's method (P = 0.05) as well as the analysis reported in Figure 11 . Table 15 shows a summary of all psychiatric adverse events in oseltamivir prophylaxis trials. Of particular note was an oseltamivir patient in study WV15825 who had severe confusion on day 27 and was hospitalised. On day 28 the patient was taken off medication and the event resolved. On day 29 the patient was discharged from hospital and subsequently resumed medication. However, confusion reappeared on day 32. The initial event was misclassified in the clinical study report as \"mental impairment\" but has since been corrected in an erratum published in the same journal that published the original trial manuscript (Gravenstein 2013; Peters 2001 ).\n\nThere was a non-significant increase in renal events on-treatment (RR 3.17, 95% CI 0.96 to 10.49, I 2 statistic = 0; RD 0.67%, 95% CI -2.93 to 0.01; NNTH = 150, 95% CI NNTH 35 to to NNTB > 1000) (Analysis 2.38). However, in sensitivity analysis using Peto's method the result for renal events was statistically significant (P = 0.02).\n\nThere was no significant effect on serious adverse events in adult treatment trials (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.50, I 2 statistic = 0%) (Analysis 3.11).\n\nIn treatment trials, there was no significant effect on diarrhoea in adults (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.14, I 2 statistic = 5%) (Analysis 3.33) or headache (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.18, I 2 statistic = 0) (Analysis 3.35). However, during the on-treatment phase, nausea and vomiting were significantly less frequent in the zanamivir arm (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.94, I 2 statistic = 0%; RD 1.63%, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.48%; NNTB = 62, 95% CI 41 to 411) (Analysis 3.32).\n\nThere was no significant effect observed on the renal system (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.72, I 2 statistic = 0%) (Analysis 3.45), or the psychiatric system (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.38, I 2 statistic = 0%) (Analysis 3.48). In adult treatment trials of zanamivir, there was no significantly increased risk of any other reported adverse events and there was no significant increase in adverse effects observed in prophylaxis trials, including psychiatric (Analysis 4. 29) and renal effects (Analysis 4.30) on-treatment. There was no significant increase in harms associated with zanamivir treatment of children but data were sparse.\n\nThere was no significant effect of zanamivir treatment on influenza diagnosis (Analysis 3.8) or probability of a four-fold increase in antibody titre (Analysis 3.9; Analysis 3.10).\n\nIn oseltamivir treatment trials, there was one death overall. This event occurred due to acute respiratory syndrome in a placebo patient without influenza in study WV15812/WV15872. In prophylaxis trials, there were four deaths in total, all in elderly patients, with two in the placebo group and two in the oseltamivir group. Causes of death were reported as two cancers, one myocardial infarction and one intestinal perforation. However, for both deaths in the oseltamivir arms the participants experienced acute renal failure on-treatment prior to death. There were eight deaths in total in the zanamivir trials. Six of the deaths were caused by neoplasias or cardiovascular events in elderly patients with multiple pathologies. However, two deaths were reported as due to influenza A pneumonia. One participant was on inhaled rimantadine plus placebo and the other on zanamivir.\n\nThe results of post-protocol hypotheses are in Appendix 10.\n\nOseltamivir and zanamivir have small, non-specific effects on reducing time to alleviation of influenza-like illness symptoms in adults, but not in asthmatic children. Using either drug as prophylaxis reduces the risk of developing symptomatic influenza. Treatment trials with oseltamivir or zanamivir do not settle the question of whether complications of influenza such as pneumonia are reduced, because of a lack of diagnostic definitions. Use of oseltamivir increases the risk of adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, psychiatric effects and renal events in adults and the risk of vomiting in children. The lower bioavailability may explain the lower toxicity of zanamivir compared to oseltamivir. The influenza virus-specific mechanism of action proposed by the producers does not fit the clinical evidence.\n\nCalls for incorporating unpublished data to supplement published trial data in systematic reviews and meta-analyses highlight deficiencies in the current methods for obtaining the most complete understanding of a drug's effects (Godlee 2010). Our methodological approach entailed comprehensive searching of unpublished sources, with a particular emphasis on obtaining unpublished and internal reports from drug manufacturers intended for regulatory submission and comments from national regulatory bodies. Our decision not to use published evidence as a basis for trial appraisal and data extraction meant that we had to reconcile and synthesise information from multiple unpublished sources. We had to devise a new method of searching, indexing, retrieving and reviewing trial data and to combine this understanding with regulatory comments to produce an informative review. The first step in this process entailed the need to develop our own reconstruction of the trial programme without initial help from outside sources. The reconstructed list of trials and then programmes took a wholetime-equivalent (WTE) researcher 20 days to compile. Due to the complexity of the task we suggest that in the future some of the essential phases, such as trial ID checking, be conducted in pairs. One of the comments received on our protocol suggested that discrepancies between published and unpublished versions of the same data set could be due to mistakes in the non-peer reviewed, unedited clinical study reports (which may be corrected by the time of publication). Our experience, especially with the non-reporting of serious adverse events, points to the opposite being the case (Jefferson 2011b) . Considering the fact that unintentional errors can occur, we believe the response should not be a resort to published papers as 'most accurate' and best unit of analysis, but rather that clinical study reports -as by far the most comprehensive record of a trial -remain the key unit of analysis, with the expectation that they be amended and kept as accurate as possible over time, with complete documentation of reasons for any amendments. We believed that the results of our review would be undermined without accessing a more complete body of evidence that we knew to be outside the public domain. In theory, trial registers would be expected to provide a comprehensive picture of a drug's trial programme. However, registers were not our primary instruments to reconstruct zanamivir and oseltamivir trial programmes. Both drugs' programmes were mainly run in the late 1990s, before trial registration became the norm. In addition, registers may suffer from some of the problems that we were trying to address. Bourgeois 2011 audited entries for 546 trials of five major classes of drugs on ClinicalTrials.gov, the biggest prospective register of clinical trials, and found evidence of risk of reporting bias and delay in reporting of results. Another review of 152 trials found that the description of 123 (or 81%) of the trials in the sample had been changed in at least one key element in the time between registration and publication. The most frequent changes regarded outcomes (Huic 2011). Despite the current limits of registers, both specifically to this review and in the way they are run and updated, we believe that registers are an obvious first choice to start reconstruction of trials programmes. Searching for unpublished material has not yet become standard practice in conducting Cochrane reviews (Van Driel 2009), and is currently variably reported (Ghersi 2010). The indexing and review of regulatory files was also a very laborious task. It took a WTE researcher three days to review the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulator's comments and gain a basic understanding of the content. Four additional days were needed to read and annotate the FDA zanamivir files and 28 days for reading and annotating the oseltamivir files and building the . We reasoned that if the yield were comparable, the Boolean strategy would have been faster. The yield of citations of the two strategies was the same for six of seven 'tracker' studies but use of a Boolean string was considerably faster (an average of 3 versus 14 hours) than the term-by-term strategy. The National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) submission citations took two hours to list in a TOC using a Boolean strategy. We adopted the Boolean search strategy to construct our TOC. Ultimately it is possible that a search with the trial numerals ('15670') may be sufficient to identify the vast majority of citations. To validate this method of searching further our methods should be repeated on other sets of regulatory documents. Once we had reconstructed the trial programmes we submitted the results to GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Roche for their input. We received detailed feedback from both but as late as 2011 Roche's list of trials was incomplete. Despite the laboriousness of the methods, we believe we ended up with a far more comprehensive and less biased set of evidence than that available through the current system of journal-based publications. This shift in our data synthesis paradigm was made necessary by the numerous and documented discrepancies between regulatory and published evidence and by the sizeable risk of publication bias of the oseltamivir trial pro-gramme. The importance of reconstructing the trial programme by first generating a complete trial list was further reinforced upon discovering bias and oversights in regulators' handling of the trial programme. Regulators focus on a few mutually agreed \"pivotal\" trials whose data analyses are replicated by the FDA but not by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Both largely ignored trial M76001, the largest oseltamivir treatment trial conducted prior to initial registration of the drug (and still unpublished). While the manufacturer may not have offered it as a \"pivotal\" trial, far smaller and even ongoing studies were included in the evidence base to support Roche's year 1999 New Drug Application number 021087 (Treatment of uncomplicated acute illness due to influenza infections in adults who have been symptomatic for no more than two days). The depth of the EMA scrutiny is harder to assess as we could find no reports of trial site visits or of data analysis replication, but we identified a pooled analysis of treatment \n\nReviewing huge quantities of complicated data and linked comments is a very difficult and delicate process. The main problem is not so much the appraisal following standard rules and possible synthesis of data (as when we review published information), but the reconstructions and logical threading of a trial programme generating huge amounts of data needing appraisal. Also the manufacturer's full regulatory submission, which may have even more information than a full clinical study report, remains confidential. Most of the essential data required are available in clinical study reports, together with masses of less important data, but as we have explained even in this case there may be important omissions, such as mislaid diary cards for follow-up. Manufacturers are under obligation to provide regulators with all data requested to enable them to reach a decision: in doing so they produce vast submissions. None of the authors (all experienced systematic reviewers) had any experience of reviewing regulatory information. Given the laborious and painstaking process we tried to identify a quicker and equally reliable way of reviewing regulatory information but could not find any obvious shortcuts. However, we be-lieve that providing a critical overview of a trial programme rather than minute dissection of each trial is necessary. This can be done by identifying the important topics in the trial programme (such as the effects of the drug on symptoms, infection, complications, transmission and well-being) and following them throughout the programme, knitting the evidence into a coherent narrative. This includes carrying out a high-level overview of the mode of action of the drug in different populations for different indications. Understanding any drug's mode of action is core to correct reporting of its strengths and limitations. In addition, a large part of the regulatory submission is made up of chemistry, microbiological, animal model pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies, which are important for shedding light on the trial programme but which seldom feature in systematic reviews. We are unsure as to whether this information could be considered as core information but an exhaustive review of a trial programme should include reviews dedicated to such topics. These methods were crucial in discovering major concerns in trial conduct and validity, including the lack of comparability between arms induced by subset analysis and by the randomisation-analysis fork, high positivity rate of influenza, high gastrointestinal events in the placebo arms, possibly active placebo content and possible procedural breaches several trials, which are concerning. Overall, the safest and more conservative option appears to carry out analyses on the basis of the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, in which units of randomisation and analysis are the same and many of the potential problems listed are either not present or minimised. Our novel methodology remains a work in progress.\n\nReviewing regulatory comments was an essential way to deepen our understanding of the trial programme. From early on in our review we hoped that a close reading of regulatory material would allow us to understand the reason for discrepancies between US and European regulators' conclusions regarding the effects of oseltamivir, particularly (but not limited to) their purported effect on complications (Doshi 2009 Requesting specific documents and packages of information is especially important to allow a more efficient and timely reviewing process when confronted with a large volume of evidence, most of which could be of peripheral value. A request for a specific document is likely to be dealt with far more efficiently than a generic request for \"all documentation relating to oseltamivir\". This is one of the reasons why developing a TOC for any drug or family of drugs (no matter how time-consuming) is an absolute prerequisite for any serious attempt at reviewing regulatory evidence. This introduces another very difficult problem: how to handle huge quantities of structured information and the ethics of drawing conclusions from what is still a fragmentary (albeit sizeable) evidence base.\n\nOverall the FDA assessment of the performance of oseltamivir was \"modest\". This adjective appears six times in a 50-page review document (FDA 1999c). For example, in the Division Director Memorandum dated 25 October 1999, under the heading \"Public health role of antiviral treatment\" the FDA states: \"The clinical relevance of the modest treatment benefit is a highly subjective question\" (FDA 1999c, PDF page 3). The FDA refused to accept claims of oseltamivir's effects on influenza complications as \"false or misleading\" statements in promotional materials (FDA 2000f ). An FDA warning letter seems to imply, for example, that oseltamivir's mode of action is \"proposed\" or \"possibly\" [that proposed by the manufacturers] i.e. not certain (FDA 2000f). However, FDA reviewers appear to have missed important problems in Roche's clinical trials (such as the imbalance in the numbers of individuals classified as influenza-infected in oseltamivir treatment trials). Most of all, no one seems to have questioned the coherence of the evidence with the proposed mode of action of the drug.\n\nFor the first time a Cochrane review is based on all relevant full clinical study reports of a class of drugs integrated by regulatory comments. Also for the first time, all clinical study reports of trials in a manufacturer's programme (regardless of their relevance to the review) are available to readers without any restriction (apart from minimal redactions to protect anonymity further). The role of Roche and GSK in making this possible should be recognised, as well as that of the BMJ, which kept the issue in the public eye until it was resolved. The evidence we have presented and synthesised shows that both neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs) in this review have symptom-relieving effects, especially for self reported outcomes. They appear to have symptom-relieving properties that make people with influenza-like illness and self reported, investigator-mediated, unverified pneumonia feel better by shortening symptom duration and reducing the frequency of symptoms such as cough. For oseltamivir, this effect perhaps extends to cardiac symptoms, despite the short duration of treatment (five days). We are unsure what to make of this finding but we think it deserves further investigation. The issue which triggered our change of evidence-seeking methods is partly resolved: no definitions of secondary illnesses were given anywhere in the clinical study reports (for example \"pneumonia\" was defined as \"pneumonia\" in the case report forms (Table 1) and diagnostic criteria were not given); clinical diagnosis in the absence of criteria and without X-ray has only a moderate chance of being correct. We could not decide the level of diagnostic ascertainment of diagnosis of pneumonia and other complications, as it is unclear from the clinical study reports. Definitions of pneumonia were not given and the algorithm for classification of an event as pneu-monia was not supplied. In oseltamivir trials, the case report form trigger for recording of adverse events and secondary illness was a question to the participant posed by the investigator. A typical phrasing is as follows: \"Secondary illness reminder: Has the patient reported any sinusitis, otitis, bronchitis, other chest infection or pneumonia since baseline?\" This was followed by a yes/no box to be ticked and an additional form was to be filled out by the investigator for collecting details on the secondary illness. A record of medications outside trial allocation was elicited in addition to the participant's diary card. The original and Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms suggest diagnoses for all secondary illnesses and adverse events but there is no indication how the original and preferred terms were assigned. We therefore considered these outcomes to be \"self reported, investigator-mediated, unverified\" outcomes. For a subset of trials, secondary/intercurrent illness and adverse event data were collected on a single, one-page form. In our meta-analyses, we called this sub-analysis \"Trials which collected data on non-specific adverse events or secondary/intercurrent illness form\". For a different subset of trials, case report forms contained space to record diagnostic tests such as chest X-rays, tympanometry and sinus X-rays for all secondary illness but there was no reporting of such variables in the clinical study reports (Figure 12 ; Figure 13 ; Figure 14 ; Figure 15 ). In our meta-analyses, we called this sub-analysis \"Trials which collected data on specific 'Diagnosis of Secondary Illness' form\". None of the complications were defined as primary outcomes in any trial, which may explain the poverty of data definition.\n\nIn meta-regression of all 32 included studies that reported on \"pneumonia\", we found evidence that treatment effects for pneumonia are statistically different depending on the method of diagnosis. Unclear objective diagnosis was associated with an apparent 46% reduction in pneumonia due to treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors, whereas the use of objective criteria in the data collection showed no evidence of effect, with a risk ratio (RR) of 1.0. Age group (adults versus children), drug (oseltamivir versus zanamivir) and indication (treatment versus prophylaxis) showed no evidence of association with treatment effect. Meaningful conclusions on the effect of either NI on complications of influenza are difficult to draw based on the trial evidence.\n\nIn part this was due to the lack of standardised definitions. In addition, meta-analyses of these outcomes that lacked definitions were based on few events and therefore not robust. Caution is therefore urged in interpreting the meta-analysis result, which suggests that 100 patients (67 to 451) need to be treated with oseltamivir for one less self reported, investigator-mediated, unverified pneumonia. The same applies to the zanamivir treatment result, which suggests a reduced risk of self reported, investigator-mediated, unverified bronchitis in adults (number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 36 to 155). The evidence suggested oseltamivir had a similar effect, although the result was non-significant. As stated above, there is no evidence that definitions of complications in either paediatric, elderly or adult trials were ever prepared and incorporated in the trials' design. Therefore, the reporting of cases of 'otitis media', 'pneumonia', 'sinusitis' or 'bronchitis' are of unclear significance and importance, making it impossible to attribute a cause and draw conclusions (FDA 2000d) . This is probably why the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved oseltamivir package insert, since 17 November 2000, has consistently stated: \"serious bacterial infections may begin with influenza-like symptoms or may coexist with or occur as complications during the course of influenza. TAMIFLU has not been shown to prevent such complications.\" The original product label did not contain such a statement but on 14 April 2000, after oseltamivir was approved for sale in the United States, the FDA sent Roche an untitled letter about \"Misleading Efficacy Claims\" that the FDA had noted in Roche's promotional materials (FDA 2000a, PDF page 3). One of the statements that Roche made was: \"Tamiflu reduces incidence of secondary complications (i.e. bacterial infections) by 45%.\" The FDA commented: \"Further, you have claimed reductions in severity and incidence of secondary infections with Tamiflu that are misleading because they are not supported by substantial evidence\" (FDA 2000a, PDF page 3). We do not know how Roche responded to the FDA but in subsequently available Roche promotional material information, Roche's statements were consistent with the FDA's demands (Doshi 2009). There is uncertainty in the \"complications\" and \"secondary illnesses\" outcome definition therefore we carried out an analysis on the data from adult treatment trials on those complications classified as serious or those which led to study withdrawal. For os-eltamivir, there was no evidence that treatment affected such complications (risk difference (RD) 0.07%, 95% CI -0.78 to 0.44) (Analysis 1.20; Analysis 1.55). This outcome could not be assessed in oseltamivir prophylaxis due to an insufficient number of events. For zanamivir, there was no significant evidence of a treatment effect on such complications (RD -0.04%, 95% CI -0.64 to 0.24) (Analysis 3.7; Analysis 4.8). This outcome could not be assessed in children due to an insufficient number of events. Contrary to the FDA, the European Medicines Agency (EMA)'s oseltamivir 'Summary of Product Characteristics' states that oseltamivir significantly reduces the incidence of \"specified lower respiratory tract complications (mainly bronchitis) treated with antibiotics\" in individuals of 13 years of age and older. This claim is based on \"a pooled analysis of all influenza-positive adults and adolescents (N = 2413) enrolled into treatment studies\", of which 1063 were in the placebo group and 1350 were in the oseltamivirtreated population (EMA 2010) . This statement appears in the EMA files as early as 2001 (EMEA 2001). These exact denominators appear in the Kaiser 2003 meta-analysis. The design of the trials, as defined in the protocol with amendments, statistical analysis plan and case report forms, does not allow any further inferences. The effect on outcomes that were originally considered of secondary or tertiary importance (such as bronchitis and pneumonia) would have been clarified with better clinical definitions and investigations, as some of the serious adverse events were. These benefited from a paragraph-length narrative, which reported most of the salient features of the event.\n\nOur previous decision to analyse the effects of oseltamivir and zanamivir on the ITT population has been confirmed for oseltamivir with the demonstration of the effect on antibody responses in participants in treatment trials, although no such effect is discernible for zanamivir. This effect leads to the introduction of selection bias with a significantly reduced probability of being diagnosed with influenza and an imbalance in the two arms if the intention-to-treat-influenza-infected (ITTI) population is analysed. The effect of oseltamivir on antibodies appears to be carried over to children with influenza-like illness. Its finding contradicts statements made by the manufacturer. The seeming incomparability between arms of the influenza-infected subpopulations in the oseltamivir trials raises the question of how an appropriate analysis should be conducted. If influenza-infected groups are comparable (as appears to be the case in zanamivir treatment trials) then an appropriate analysis strategy (based on Senn 2004) would be to determine first the effect of treatment in the ITT population. If there is evidence of a treatment effect, then treatment by infected status interaction could be tested. If there was evidence of an interaction, then estimates of treatment effect could be derived separately for the influenza-infected and noninfluenza-infected subpopulations. However, this analysis should be conducted on the ITT population using a single appropriate statistical model, obviating the need to conduct separate analysis on the influenza-infected subpopulation. Roche used geomet-ric mean titres indicating antibody responses in the ITTI population to support their statement that oseltamivir does not affect antibody responses (for example, in Table 16 and linked text of Module 1 of trial WV15799). However, the use of such measures can be misleading. What are required for such an analysis are data on how many ITT population participants responded by arm, at what level of antibody response and how many were tested. Such data could not be identified with certainty. A further effect of choosing a subpopulation analysis (ITTI in treatment trials and ITTIINAB (ITT influenza-infected index cases who had negative virology at baseline) in prophylaxis trials) as the primary analysis is the restriction of the generalisability of results. This is especially so in the case of design flaws (for example, in the case of the postexposure prophylaxis trial WV15799, where all index cases were not treated and around 55% of participants were dropped from the ITTIINAB analysis). In this cluster-trial design households should be included as random-effects in the analysis to take account of within-household correlations. A significant but slight reduction of the proportion with serum antibody (mostly haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody) titre rise by four-fold or more among those who were tested was shown in this review. This was consistent with the evidence from animal tests using a sub-clinical dose of oseltamivir in influenza A/ H1N1-infected mice (Takahashi 2010 ). Takahashi 2010 reported a non-significant slight reduction of haemagglutinin (HA) specific IgG antibody in serum and spleen, while they reported about an 80% significant reduction of HA specific secretory IgA antibody (s-IgA Ab) in nasal wash and bronchoalveolar fluids (BALF) on day 12. From this evidence, they warned that the risk of re-infection may increase in patients showing a low mucosal IgA antibody response following oseltamivir administration. These experiments were done because they had the unexpected finding that paediatric influenza patients treated orally with oseltamivir for five days had significantly low levels (about 60% reduction on day five) of antiinfluenza S-IgA nasopharyngeal fluids compared to levels in patients not treated with oseltamivir (Sawabuchi 2009). Their findings are consistent with our findings that serum HA inhibition (HAI) antibody response was decreased by oseltamivir administration, though s-IgG Ab could not be analysed in our study because the data were not reported in the clinical study reports (Sawabuchi 2009; Takahashi 2010). These findings are also consistent with the evidence on the mode of action of oseltamivir from animal models (Module 2 of Mendel 1998; WV15670; WV15671) and from viral challenge, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in humans ). Pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3 ), were completely suppressed by oseltamivir administered 28 hours after the experimental inoculation of influenza virus, while the reduction of viral titre in nasal lavages was partial ).\n\nThere is decisive evidence that administration of oseltamivir in an-imals challenged by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) that lacks a neuraminidase gene showed a symptom-relieving effect (decreased weight loss) and inhibition of viral clearance . These effects were accompanied by a decreased CD+8 T cell surface sialoglycosphingolipid GM1 level, which is regulated by the endogenous sialidase/neuraminidase in response to viral challenge along with suppression of cytokine expression . They are consistent with those findings from the pharmaceutical company and their investigators. The findings of the study by Moore 2007 suggest a risk of infection and exacerbation of infection by pathogens other than influenza virus in spite of the apparent reduction of symptoms from infection. Sufficient plasma concentration of oseltamivir carboxylate from orally administered oseltamivir phosphate may act directly on the host endogenous neuraminidase to reduce (or suppress) the immune response even at the dose of 20 mg twice a day for five days. However, the bioavailability of inhaled zanamivir seems to be very broad: about 10% to 70%, as estimated by the area under the curve (AUC) data from the inhalation and intravenous study from the Japanese Summary Basis of Approval (JSBA). The difference in peak concentration (Cmax) was much larger (6 to 37-fold). This means that inhaled zanamivir could reach a high enough concentration to reduce the immune response, if it is administered at a high dose or a for long period, or if the patient is very susceptible. In fact, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial using healthy volunteers to investigate the effect of zanamivir treatment (20 mg/day for 14 days) on the humoral immune response to influenza vaccine showed that the zanamivir group responded with significantly lower antibody titres to the H1N1 (Cox 2001) . Pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and other chemokines, were almost completely suppressed in the viral challenge randomised controlled trial (RCT) using a very high dose (600 mg) of intravenous zanamivir before inoculation of the influenza virus in human adults (Fritz 1999). These findings all suggest that the low immune response, with a low level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, induced by the action of oseltamivir carboxylate may reduce the symptoms of influenza irrespective of an inhibition of influenza virus replication, which is widely believed to be the main mode of action of NIs. In addition, the potential hypothermic or antipyretic effect of oseltamivir (but not zanamivir) as a central nervous system depressant may also contribute to the apparent reduction of host symptoms (Ono 2008; Ono 2013 ). Zanamivir had no effect on pneumonia symptoms in treatment trials, even when the diagnosis was supported by a chest X-ray; nor did it affect antibody responses, but it did affect bronchitis. We think that this shows an undeniable symptom-relieving effect of both drugs, which also applies to more severe, if undefined, syndromes. Both drugs relieve influenza-like illness symptoms by around 0.6 to 0.7 of a day, although this is first relief and not necessarily complete relief. In the case of oseltamivir, the mix up with the follow-up cards does not allow us to draw any conclusions on a possible length of the duration of symptom relief. Also of note is the fact that this important information came to light from the FDA reports and not from the clinical study reports of the relevant trials (WV15670; WV15671). This points to the incomplete nature of reporting in the clinical study reports and the important role of Summary Basis of Approval (SBA) regulatory information.\n\nIn a subgroup analysis we found no evidence of a difference in treatment effect for zanamivir on time to first alleviation of symptoms in adults in the influenza-infected and non-influenza-infected subgroups. Both subgroups showed strong evidence of treatment effect of 0.5 to 0.7 days reduction in time to first alleviation of symptoms. This strongly supports our hypothesis that these drugs do not have an influenza-specific effect. Oseltamivir relieves symptoms in otherwise healthy children, but no effect was noted with zanamivir, which may be due to the limited power of the two eligible trials with just over 700 children in total. However, oseltamivir does not have any effect on asthmatic children with influenza-like illness, a population which should benefit most from its use. One explanation for this finding is in the nature of the young asthmatic population, which is well cared for and used to regular powerful medications and close follow-up. The incremental benefit of oseltamivir is thus likely to be undetectable in such a population. An alternative explanation could be the higher susceptibility of the immune system to suppression by oseltamivir carboxylate in asthmatic children compared with those in the placebo group. The finding that oseltamivir administered to asthmatic children reduces symptoms faster than in placebo recipients at the beginning of the study, but during the off-treatment period more recovered later than those administered placebo, gives some support to this explanation. There is no evidence of an effect of oseltamivir on hospitalisations.\n\nHospitalisations are an important but poorly defined outcome in the oseltamivir protocols, inconsistently reported in the clinical study reports and overlooked in the zanamivir protocols and reports. The oseltamivir trials did not detect any influenza-related deaths, reflecting the relatively benign nature of influenza in the study populations. The zanamivir trials detected eight deaths, of which only two were likely to be due to influenza and both occurred in the intervention arms. All the trials were likely to be underpowered to detect differential effects on mortality, but the absence of deaths in placebo recipients again underlines the benign nature of influenza. In fact mortality in Japan during the 2009A/H1N1 influenza outbreak was 198 among about 20 million influenza patients (one in 100,000 infected). Early deterioration leading to death was observed more frequently in oseltamivir compared to zanamivir or no antivirals recipients . Overall the two drugs have similar benefits but quite different toxicity profiles. On average, for every 28 (14 to 112) adults treated with oseltamivir there will be one more report of nausea and for every 22 (14 to 42) adults and 19 (10 to 57) children there will be one more report of vomiting. Oseltamivir seems to have an apparent protective effect on diarrhoea, contrary to the other evidence of gastrointestinal disturbance. This finding might be as an effect of a placebo containing dehydrocholic acid or it might be one of the results of the influenza-like illness symptom-relieving effects (similar to relief of tachycardia and palpitation). The other apparent gastrointestinal events, such as nausea and vomiting, may be the results of central nervous disorders indicated by \"only day 1 increase of vomiting\" in treatment trials in children.\n\nFor every 62 (41 to 411) adults exposed to zanamivir there will be one less case of nausea and vomiting, but no such effect was visible in children, probably because of a lack of power. Zanamivir does not appear to affect the frequency of bowel movements.\n\nIn the prophylaxis data set, \"influenza without laboratory confirmation\" (i.e. influenza-like illness) was only partially reported in the oseltamivir clinical study reports and not reported in the zanamivir clinical study reports, except for NAI30034 in which no significant reduction was observed (9% versus 10%). As a consequence we are unable to report on that outcome. The size of the reduction in influenza symptoms in oseltamivir prophylactic trials is inferior in magnitude to that seen in hand washing to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), based on seven casecontrol studies (odds ratio (OR) 0.77, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.84, I 2 statistic = 68%, RD -0.12, -0.16 to 0.08, I 2 statistic = 26%), the NNTB being approximately 50 for prophylaxis with oseltamivir and eight with hand washing (Jefferson 2011a ).\n\nThere is a significant reduction in the proportion of patients with symptomatic influenza with both NIs. However, these findings do not reflect the true efficacy for prevention of influenza, because they conceal the positivity of laboratory testing (measured through tests of viral shedding and four-fold antibody titre rise). We found an apparent prophylactic effect of zanamivir on pneumonia (which was not defined in case report forms) when it was used for 14 to 28 days. However, we found no evidence of significant effects on other complications and no evidence of an effect of oseltamivir on complications or hospitalisations. Oseltamivir induced nausea in people undergoing prophylaxis but there was insufficient evidence to show an association with vomiting.\n\nOn-treatment renal adverse events were three times more common in the oseltamivir arms compared to the placebo arms, with 150 treated patients leading to one additional event. The two participants who died in the oseltamivir arms both experienced acute renal failure while on-treatment, although only one of those events was listed as an adverse event. The unlisted event was in a 91-year old female who was \"withdrawn from the study on Study Day 15 because her estimated creatinine clearance was less than 30 mL/ min. The screening laboratory examinations, that were carried out 10 days before the start of study treatment, were normal\". Hyperglycaemic adverse events (aggravated diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia) were also more common in the oseltamivir arms, with eight events in total (one in WV15673/WV15697, two in WV15708 and five in WV15825) compared to none in the corresponding placebo arms. These data are only presented descriptively as they are too few (< 10) to meta-analyse formally, as prespecified in our analysis plan. Finally, oseltamivir caused headaches and psychiatric harms in adult prophylaxis trials. Headaches are one of the most prominent harms of oseltamivir. There is evidence of a dose-response effect in prophylaxis trials WV15673/WV15697 (P = 0.013), in which headaches were observed in 202/519, 225/520 and 242/520 participants in the placebo, oseltamivir 75 mg once daily and 75 mg twice daily arms, respectively. In the psychiatric category, several rare and severe single events (nervousness, aggression, hallucinations, psychosis, suicide ideation and paranoia) were reported significantly more frequently in the intervention arm. Added to other more frequently reported but not significantly different events (such as depression and confusion) this gave a large effect and a relatively small number needed to treat to harm of 94 (36 to 1538). The importance of such a finding lies in the distribution of oseltamivir to large numbers of asymptomatic individuals following pandemic plans. There were no prophylaxis trials in children that met our inclusion criteria, therefore we cannot report on prophylaxis harms in this important population.\n\nThe question of why oseltamivir treatment trials failed to identify a clear association between oseltamivir and psychiatric harms, although a weak dose-dependent association was observed, is a moot point. It is possible that influenza-like illness and influenza symptoms masked the harms in those who were already symptomatic and therefore recruited in the treatment trials (and influenza-type symptoms were excluded as adverse events to be reported). The reporting issue of compliharms may have helped to mask such events. Alternatively, it could be that these events are rare in the populations studied and that there was insufficient power to detect an association. The CI was wide (0.43 to 2.03) and does not rule out a doubling in risk due to treatment -as was found in the prophylaxis trials. It is also possible that the risk of psychiatric harm increases with increasing dose (as the data from trials WV15670 and WV15671 suggest) and increasing duration of treatment (as the prophylaxis trials suggest). Toovey 2008 assessed the issue and failed to find an association between neurological and psychiatric adverse events and oseltamivir exposure. The outcomes studied were not based on the a priori definition of psychiatric adverse events as defined in the clinical study reports. The definition was constructed post hoc based on a selected group of adverse events taken from the psychiatric, neurological and injury body systems in the reports. The issues are described fully in Jones 2012 and Toovey's response is in Toovey 2012. Toovey 2008 reviewed only retrospective observational studies and did not review three prospective cohort studies conducted in Japan.\n\nA meta-analysis of three prospective cohort studies of neuropsychi-atric adverse events (NPAEs) in Japanese children show a pooled odds ratio for abnormal behaviours due to oseltamivir exposure of 1.55 (95% CI 1.21 to 1.98; P = 0.0005) without significant heterogeneity (Hama 2010 ). In one prospective study of several thousand children with influenza carried out to test the hypothesis of a causal relation between oseltamivir and neuropsychiatric events, abnormal behaviour was observed more frequently in oseltamivir recipient children than in controls (RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.34 to 1.83). Abnormal behaviour was observed in 3.4 per 100 person day (or 13.8%) in the oseltamivir group, compared to 2.2 per 100 person-days (or 8.8%) in the control group (Yorifuji 2009). Reanalysis of this study population, focusing on delirium and unconsciousness, also showed a significant association between oseltamivir and neuropsychiatric events, especially in the very early phase of the illness within a day of commencement of fever (Fuiita 2011). These indicate that prospective and intentional collection with this scale of participants may be necessary in treatment RCTs.\n\nAnimal toxicity study results firmly support the effect of oseltamivir on the central nervous system. One of these is the hypothermic effect of oseltamivir (but not zanamivir) administered orally, intraperitoneally (Ono 2008; Ono 2013 ) and intracerebroventricularly (Ono 2013 ). The other is that intra-duodenal or intravenous administration of oseltamivir to mature rats induced respiratory arrest shortly followed by cardiac arrest. These studies clearly show central depressant effects of oseltamivir (Kimura 2012). Moreover in the post-marketing toxicology phase studies by Roche, many symptoms that the manufacturer considered \"item-related\" were observed: alterations in respiration including decreased respiratory rate/gasping and altered mucous membrane/ skin colour (pale) prior to death. Although the manufacturer denied the causality (Freichel 2009), symptoms at two hours after administration that showed dose-related increase were lack of olfactory orientation, lack of cliff aversion and low or very low arousal. Twenty-four of 52 pups that did not exhibit cliff aversion were later found dead. Fourteen of 17 animals with low or very low arousal died thereafter. These findings are consistent with the clinically observed psychiatric symptoms in the RCTs and postmarketing spontaneous reports. Zanamivir was well tolerated. However, a potentially active placebo may have masked the occurrence of bronchospasm in zanamivir trials. Treatment trials were mostly under-recruited and often their results pooled post hoc in two or even three trials, and yet they showed very high influenza positivity rates. One possible explanation for this lies in the intensive surveillance carried out in the predefined trial centre areas and the restricted time span of recruitment during high likelihood of positivity periods. This may be why many centres with low levels of recruitment are listed in the clinical study reports; this limits the generalisability of the results to everyday life. In a primary or secondary prophylaxis indication the postulated central effect of oseltamivir is confined to suppressing symptoms, as infection was not prevented even when oseltamivir was administered prior to the inoculation of influenza virus both in animals (Mendel 1998) and in humans ) and the prophylaxis trials. However, the central problem remains the incompatibility of the two contrasting claims of its activity against antibody production. If, as reported in many documents, oseltamivir does not interfere with antibody production (see, for example, FDA 2011a; Roche Investigators' Guide), how is it possible that oseltamivir prevents cases of influenza when part of the definition of prevented cases in oseltamivir trials was based on absence of antibody response?\n\nThe apparent ability of oseltamivir to interfere with antibody response calls into question the mode of action of the drug and puts in doubt the proposed effects of oseltamivir. One possibility in treatment trials is that oseltamivir administration, by interfering with antibody production, has the effect of selecting the strongest antibody responders in the ITTI subpopulation. These individuals are classified as influenza cases and are included in the oseltamivir arm of the ITTI population. This selected subpopulation probably represents the healthiest or those least likely to experience complications. An alternative consequence could be that interference with antibody production in the oseltamivir arm led to active arm participants being more likely to develop complications due to impaired immune function. Evidence from prophylaxis and secondary prophylaxis trials suggests that in addition to the apparent similar mode of action as in the treatment studies, suppression of viral shedding in nasal swab may be of importance. In the former, participants who become positive (i.e. who are subsequently classified as cases of influenza) in the oseltamivir arms are the few who mount a strong response despite oseltamivir interference. The remainder (who are significantly more than in the placebo arm) are classified as prevented or avoided cases. However, as prophylaxis clinical study reports do not report antibody responses and viral isolate results for the ITT populations either, it is impossible to tell whether this proposed mode of action fits all the evidence. The effect of oseltamivir on nasal shedding is consistent with the proposed mode of action of NIs in preventing the virus from leaving the host respiratory epithelial cells, which are covered by a mucous layer. Compared with the rather small reduction of symptoms of influenza-like illness and reduction in antibody rise (up to 10%) by both oseltamivir and zanamivir, the extent of the reduction of symptomatic influenza is almost half. This may be due to reduction of influenza viruses in the nasal swab sample.\n\nIn prophylaxis there is no evidence that oseltamivir reduces symptomatic influenza-like illness. Oseltamivir reduces the number of prophylaxis participants testing positive (based on antibody rise and/or culture test). However, this finding is weakened by oseltamivir's interference with the viral replication on the swab and effect on antibody production. In addition oseltamivir does not affect asymptomatic influenza and there is no evidence that it interferes with person-to-person spread.\n\nSimilarly to the FDA (FDA 1999c; FDA 2000c) because of the problems with the design of study WV15799 we could not draw any conclusions on the ability of oseltamivir to interrupt viral transmission. This is important as the results of trial WV15799 formed part of the WHO3 rationale for use of the drug to interrupt transmission from person to person and allow time before the arrival of vaccines in the event of a pandemic furnishing a seemingly powerful rationale for stockpiling oseltamivir. This shows the importance of availability of full clinical study reports, something the WHO did not have. Antibody suppression seems stronger for oseltamivir than zanamivir, probably due to the difference in bioavailability. It may be that evidence of other effects, such as hyperglycaemia and renal impairment (though significance was marginal) in the prophylaxis trials may be due to inhibition of the host's endogenous neuraminidase, which impairs the cell function of various organs (Hama 2008) . Overall, the significance of oseltamivir for nasal shedding is unclear but problems with sampling and culture undermine any claims as to its secondary prophylactic properties, as the FDA made clear in its response (FDA 1999c).\n\nThe dose-response increase in psychiatric events in the \"pivotal\" oseltamivir treatment trials and the increase in vomiting only on day one in treatment trials in children may be due to the sudden onset of the central action of unchanged oseltamivir (Hama 2008 ). Brain concentration of unchanged oseltamivir increases during the early phase of influenza in juvenile animals (Freichel 2009), due to a reduced or low function of p-glycoprotein, a major transporter of oseltamivir at the blood-brain barrier (Hama 2008 ; Kimura 2012). The likely centrally mediated mode of action of oseltamivir is supported by the finding of adverse events in healthy people in prophylaxis trials. However, these effects may also be derived from a delayed action associated with host endogenous neuraminidase inhibition by oseltamivir (Hama 2008) , because this appeared after more than a week's exposure the drug and lasted for more than two weeks. Other effects, such as pain in the limbs, hyperglycaemia or diabetic events, reduction of antibody rise and reduction of cytokine induction, may also be due to the suppression of the host's endogenous neuraminidase by oseltamivir . Pain in the limbs and metabolic control events (mainly hyperglycaemia) were in excess in the oseltamivir arms, but we did not carry out a formal meta-analysis, as they were not prespecified in our analysis plan and the number of events was below 10 for metabolic events. Statements made about the capacity of oseltamivir to interrupt viral transmission and reduce complications are not supported by any data we have been able to access. We have not reviewed other NIs, such as laninamivir and peramivir, or other antivirals, such as the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine), or antipyretic/anti-inflammatory agents either. Laninamivir and peramivir may be more potent as NIs, because their bioavailability is far higher than zanamivir and may affect the host's endogenous neuraminidase. Adamantanes are well known centrally active agents and may be more harmful than oseltamivir and zanamivir. Anti-inflammatory antipyretics (except paracetamol) may be more toxic than NIs (Hama 2008) . Hence, the other NIs, adamantanes and anti-inflammatory antipyretics may not be alternatives to oseltamivir and zanamivir.\n\nWe used the Cochrane seven-domain 'Risk of bias' instrument to assess bias. The availability of partial or complete clinical study reports decreased the uncertainty and allowed definitive judgements to be made. Previous unclear risk of bias became certainty of bias or certainty of absence of bias. Certainty or low levels of uncertainty are due to our expectations regarding the complete clinical study reports. We were expecting to have all relevant and consistent information available for our reviews, but when it was not, our judgements changed because we found gaps in the availability of information and inconsistent information. We are still uncertain whether the complete study reports represent an exhaustive and coherent source of trial narrative and data.\n\nIn the case of treatment trials, conclusions and generalisations are drawn from a subpopulation in which the two arms do not appear comparable due to the apparent ability of oseltamivir to interfere with influenza antibody production. The effect of oseltamivir on the gastrointestinal tract appears to be notable, although a definitive statement will only be possible once the mode of action and dosage of dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate and dehydrocholic acid have been clarified. The high percentage of influenza infections appears to be in contrast with the need to pool or delay several trials and the small recruitment size of others because of a lack of influenza circulation. In the case of post-exposure prophylaxis trials, the selection of the infected population has the effect of excluding from the analysis large percentages (in some cases over 50%) of participants. This brings the generalisability of the results of these trials into question. Much has been made in the trial programmes of viral nasal voidance as a marker of effect. However, its measurement was unreliable in treatment trials as this verbatim quote from the FDA review shows: \"Duration of viral shedding was measured from treatment initiation to the time of the first negative virus culture with no subsequent positive cultures. Upon reviewing a list of viral shedding patterns provided by the applicant on 8/16/99, two problems emerged: (1) the pattern of virus shedding was fluctuating in at least 33 subjects (i.e. pos-neg-pos-neg, with or without a subsequent negative result). (2) In at least 100 subjects, the last virus shedding sample was the first negative sample in sequence, meaning there was not a subsequent negative confirmation. Given the fluctuating pattern of virus shedding, to estimate the duration of viral shedding based on the occurrence of a single first negative data poses a high level of uncertainty\" (FDA 1999c). In all programmes, the effect on complications was based on unclear and potentially unreliable definitions, often at the discretion of local clinicians and confirmation (e.g. radiological confirmation of pneumonia) was not consistently reported when it did occur.\n\nIn the ITT population, the correct population for analysis, there is no credible effect of oseltamivir against pneumonia as the significance of the term \"pneumonia\" is not clarified.\n\nIn the case of post-exposure prophylaxis trial WV15799, nasal voidance was measured only in symptomatic subjects as an adjunct to protocol version H. However, this does not prevent the manufacturers from making claims of effect for all these outcomes.\n\nOther general requirements, such as presentation within 36 to 48 hours, raise questions about the generalisability of the research evidence. However, underlying all our doubts is the conflicting evidence on the mode of action of the drug. Most of the trials were substantially under-recruited and so had insufficient power individually to answer the research question.\n\nWe assessed all full clinical study reports of relevant trials. \n\nThe main limitation of our study is our relative inexperience in dealing with large quantities of information and our lack of familiarity with certain trial documents, such as randomisation lists. Randomisation lists appeared to be of two types. The first was a pre-randomisation list of random codes with which participants' IDs cannot be matched with the participant IDs used within other sections of the clinical study report. The second was a post hoc randomisation list to which individual participants can be matched but the original generated codes are not shown. In both cases the truly random generation of the sequence could not be properly assessed because either the original codes are not provided or original codes cannot be matched to patients. We have created methods and procedures to address the risk of reporting bias that we identified in published trials, but remain uncertain about the success of these new methods. Hernan and Lipsitch evaluated lower respiratory tract complications and found a statistically significant, but smaller, reduction in the risk of these complications. Hernan and Lipsitch omitted evaluating the Kaiser paper's conclusion that oseltamivir reduced the risk of hospitalisation. They wrote, \"it was not possible to assess the potential benefit for highrisk participants who are hospitalised, because the sample size of most studies was too small to consider hospitalisation as an outcome.\" Hernan and Lipsitch do not elaborate on or highlight their apparent methodological disagreement with the Kaiser 2003 analysis and it is not reflected in the news article published on the Harvard website entitled \"Oseltamivir effect on complications confirmed by reanalysis\" (http://ccdd.hsph.harvard.edu/NewsEvents/ Oseltamivir-reanalysis). In fact, Hernan and Lipsitch did not confirm one of the key conclusions of the Kaiser paper Review Team 2011). The approach Hernan and Lipsitch took in analysing data was insufficient to provide a credible, independent check on validity and reinforces the importance of detailed, critical assessment of entire trial programmes, with access to full-length study reports. Our analysis questions the coherence between the evidence and the proposed mode of action of oseltamivir. The Ebell 2012 review concluded that there was \"no evidence that oseltamivir reduces the likelihood of hospitalisation, pneumonia or the combined outcome of pneumonia, otitis media and sinusitis in the ITT population\". This conclusion was based on Module 1 of the 10 Kaiser trials plus WV16277. These are the same 11 trials as Hernan 2011.\n\nOn the basis of the findings of this review, clinicians and healthcare policy-makers should urgently revise current recommendations for use of the neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs) for individuals with influenza. Our findings confirm that both oseltamivir and zanamivir reduce the time to symptomatic improvement in adults (but not asthmatic children) with influenza-like illness. The size of this effect is small, approximately half a day. It is unclear whether this is superior to treatment with commonly used antipyretic medications. However, we did not find any credible evidence that either oseltamivir or zanamivir reduce the risk of complications of influenza, particularly pneumonia, nor reduce risk of hospitalisation or death. Moreover, even in individuals at higher risk of complications, such as children with asthma or the elderly, we found no evidence of a beneficial effect for reducing risks of complications.\n\nBased on these findings there appears to be no evidence for patients, clinicians or policy-makers to use these drugs to prevent serious outcomes, both in annual influenza and pandemic influenza outbreaks. Practice recommendations and drug labelling needs to be changed to reflect these findings.\n\nWhen used as prophylactic agents to prevent the occurrence of influenza in individuals or families, our findings again suggest a minimal effect on prevention. Based on this, there is little support for their use as prophylactic agents, for example, during influenza epidemics. Given that oseltamivir is now recommended as an essential medicine for the treatment of seriously ill patients or those in higher-risk groups with influenza (H1N1 2009) (WHO 2013a; WHO 2013b), this is of some concern.\n\nReasons why prophylaxis treatment is not clinically meaningful include: 1) according to modelling studies, for prophylactic treatment to be effective, 80% of the population require at least eight weeks of treatment, which has not been trialled (Longini 2004);\n\n2) models assume the relative risk reduction observed in low risk populations, transfers directly to populations at higher risk (i.e. an absolute treatment effect of 31%, approximately 15-fold higher than the absolute effects we observed in prophylaxis trials (Longini 2004); 3) A high proportion of people, at least two-thirds require recognisable influenza symptoms; 4) treatment has to be effective against both asymptomatic and symptomatic infections (which it is not), in modelling studies asymptomatic infections are assumed to be 50% as infectious as symptomatic infections (Longini 2004); 5) because the influenza season can last four to five months, any secondary strategy, such as vaccination, would have to be widely available at the end of the eight week treatment period, and 6) a full understanding of the effect of the treatment in prophylaxis is unknown because symptomatic influenza-like-illness without laboratory-confirmation was only fully reported in one study. This study (NAI30034) showed no difference in proportion of patients with symptomatic influenza-like-illness (with or without lab confirmation) (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.11).\n\nThe small benefits we noted in symptomatic improvement and the lack of credible evidence for an effect on serious complications needs to be balanced with the adverse effects found with these drugs in meta-analyses, especially diabetic/hyperglycaemic, renal and neuropsychiatric effects in all those people for whom the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend use.\n\nOur results do not discount the potential benefit of using zanamivir and oseltamivir in individuals under particular situations, for example in immunocompromised or in compassionate cases, where few other therapeutic options may exist. However, NIs themselves may be immunosuppressants. Our findings do not support the stockpiling of NIs, nor oseltamivir's inclusion in the WHO's list of essential drugs.\n\nThe rationale for undertaking the current review and the methods and pressures that needed to be employed to obtain and evaluate the evidence for these drugs has significant implications for the robustness of the scrutiny that new drugs undergo prior to entering widespread clinical use. We believe that several steps now need to be put in place to provide patients, clinicians and policy-makers with the most transparent assessment of the relative benefits and risks of new drugs.\n\nFirst, our findings imply that numerous national and international bodies appear willing to accept biased or incomplete trial reports seemingly at face value. This ready willingness is in contrast with the considerable time and effort needed to change their recommendations. Second, published trials are unlikely to provide the level of detail to allow the results of a drug trial to be properly evaluated and risk presenting a partial and potentially biased report of trial conduct and findings. This has implications not only for the reporting of trials but also the weight that can be applied to published studies alone. Third, clinicians and policy-makers should be cautious in interpreting and using the findings of systematic reviews including only published studies, particularly those that comprise only a portion of an entire drug trial programme, or which contain only a portion of the results of trials. There have been many systematic reviews of NIs, none assessing the full trial programme or full trial results, thus limiting their validity. We suspect a similar situation exists for other drugs. Fourth, clinical policy-makers at the national and international level should raise the level of scrutiny needed in the cases of drugs that are likely to be used by large numbers of people who are either asymptomatic or have short, self limiting illnesses such as influenza ('public health drugs') and where the potential for benefit (and harm) is vital. Given the weight of these decisions (with serious implications for both correct and incorrect decisions), policy-makers should not face the barrier of being denied access to what sponsors regard as commercially sensitive information.\n\nWithout concerted efforts from multiple stakeholders to put the above measures in place, it is not possible to provide objective assessment of the benefits and risks of new drugs. This risks not only patients potentially missing out on effective treatments, but also patients being exposed to either ineffective (or harmful) treatments.\n\nOur findings have implications for research on the mechanism of action of NIs, with special regard to any direct central action of oseltamivir and the inhibitory effect of the host endogenous neuraminidase of various organs and systems. We could not reach a consensus on whether further trials are warranted and whether current trials should be discontinued.\n\nThe considerable body of evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included in this review indicates either no effect or a relatively small absolute effect size against the complications of influenza. Such an effect, even if statistically significant, would be too small to warrant treatment with NIs in a primary care setting, especially since effective diagnosis and treatments for rare complications (such as pneumonia) are available. Lack of evidence of an effect on hospitalisations probably indicates lack of severity in the first place. Assuming an influenza incidence rate of 2% (similar to that in the control arms of oseltamivir treatment trials), to detect a 25%, clinically significant reduction in pneumonia, 21,500 participants would have to be enrolled in a clinical trial.\n\nOur calculation is likely to underestimate population size, as the 2% incidence rate was derived from trials that used enhanced ad hoc surveillance systems. Any trial design would have to ensure that the presence of complications is ascertained using objective diagnostic criteria (for example, with confirmation using imaging or laboratory testing for pneumonia). Such trials would also have to consider the ethical implications of conducting studies where the estimate of benefit (based on 11 RCTs) in otherwise healthy people is likely to be small, and would have to be balanced against the apparent risks of adverse effects from NIs. We think research should be aimed at more effective preventive measures and early identification of complications.\n\nBased on the length of time it has taken to provide a definitive answer on the efficacy of the NIs, the challenges in obtaining the full information and the methods that we needed to develop to conduct the evidence synthesis, we believe the main implication of our review is the need for reform of multiple components of the research and development, regulatory and assessment pathway of new drugs.\n\nPharmaceutical sponsors of drug trials should follow a data access and sharing procedure similar to that of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and sponsors should make all full clinical study reports available to be downloaded from their websites and shared freely once a regulatory decision has been made. Redactions should be kept to the minimum. Part of this process needs to include a full list of the entire drug development programme, to avoid assessment of an incomplete set of trials. Researchers and industry employees who are listed in trial documents should be considered to have legal responsibility for the conduct and reporting of a trial.\n\nRegulators should post an inventory of their documentary holdings on their websites with a brief description of the main content and size of each file. They should make all information available shortly after making a registration decision on a drug and within a reasonable time period. The information should be in electronic format and anonymised (i.e. participants' details should be removed to prevent each person being identified but no further).\n\nTrial registries have improved the reporting of new trials. However, on their own they will not be adequate to resolve the problems we encountered. The completeness of trial registries needs to tested with a random sampling procedure. Clear instructions for the reporting and updating of their content should be promulgated and penalties imposed on breaches of these procedures. Trial registration should include the original and final versions of a trial protocol, with a full declaration of dated amendments. Procedures for trial unblinding and dates of unblinding should be routinely reported. Registration should be made compulsory for all studies in which human beings are randomly assigned to experimental arms. Ethical and consent procedures for all trials should include obligations of the trial sponsor to ensure results are made public. Failure to report the existence of a trial on humans and to make results available should be considered as an ethical breach of conduct and subject to appropriate penalties.\n\nThe methods used to conduct our evidence synthesis need to be repeated across further interventions and by other researchers and may need to be refined further. Given the considerable resources involved in using these methods, a system is needed to prioritise reviews of important drugs so that such methods are reserved for drugs that meet certain conditions. Priority could perhaps be given to first drugs of a new family, drugs considered to be innovative or those that are likely to have a big market impact. Such reviews should be publicly funded and be independent from both regulators and manufacturers. Researchers who conduct these 'high scrutiny' reviews need to be free of recent ties to either government or the pharmaceutical industry. Systematic review groups such as The Cochrane Collaboration should consider both adopting these methods for other drugs and whether perhaps to scrutinise the published reviews of prioritised drugs.\n\nFinally, all documentary evidence relating to a trial on humans (including clinical study reports, regulatory documents, evidence syntheses) should be archived electronically with no statute of limitations.\n\nAuthors' note: in reviewing over 2 GB of data there is the possibility of mistakes.

Intolerance to lactose Definition of patient populations for analysis Influenza-positive population (N = 151) All participants in the ITT population with laboratory-confirmed influenza determined either from pre-treatment diagnostic sample or a positive serology result. If diagnostic sample and serology were both positive but indicated different influenza types, influenza type was assigned according to diagnostic sample result. Secondary population for assessment of efficacy\n\nAll randomised participants included in the treatment group to which they were assigned even if no medication was taken. Primary population for assessment of efficacy Safety (N = 196) Participants randomised to treatment who took at least 1 dose of study medication. Participants excluded if there was clear evidence of failure to take any study medication. Used for safety data\n\nZanamivir (5 mg per inhalation) 2 inhalations twice a day plus placebo 2 sprays per nostril (0.1 mL per spray) twice a day Zanamivir (5 mg per inhalation) 2 inhalations twice a day plus zanamivir (16 mg/mL) 2 sprays per nostril (0.1 mL per spray, equivalent to 1.6 mg zanamivir) twice a day Placebo 2 inhalations twice a day plus placebo 2 sprays per nostril (0.1 mL per spray) twice a day Treatment period: 5 days Follow-up period: 23 days post-treatment Co-interventions: relief medication described and measured as an outcome but not clear whether this was administered as co-intervention Outcomes Primary outcome: time to alleviation of major influenza symptoms Secondary outcomes: Time (in days from initiation of treatment) to eradication of major signs and symptoms of influenza Combined symptom analysis Mean daily temperature over the study treatment period (days 1 to 5) Number of days (from initiation of treatment) until the patient was able to return to normal activities Number of days out of days 1 to 10 that the patient recorded any symptom as 'moderate' or 'severe' Number of days out of days 1 to 10 that the patient recorded their overall symptom assessment (OSA) as 'moderate' or 'severe' Number of days out of days 2 to 10 that the patient recorded sleep disturbance as 'moderate' or 'severe' Mean supportive drug use Investigator global assessment of symptoms Day at which viral shedding fell below limit of quantitation (core centres only)\n\nArea under the viral shedding curve (core centres only)\n\nThe original intention was for 273 patients (91 patients per treatment group) to be recruited but due to the relatively low incidence of influenza, this target was not achieved The protocol for this study was amended twice. Both of these amendments were implemented prior to the commencement of recruitment. As a result of both internal discussions and external discussions with regulatory authorities, the statistical methods employed were substantially different from those documented in the protocol Cough and sore throat were reported as major symptom in clinical study reports but not in the protocol and discrepancies occurred between the protocol and clinical study reports regarding evaluation of viral shedding Study period: November 1994 to April 1995 \n\nAll outcomes study treatment administered. The blind was maintained by ensuring that trial medication and placebo had an identical appearance, shape, administration schedule, smell and taste. 1 envelope was opened for a patient 3 months after the conclusion of their treatment but as this was some time after treatment, it was not seen to affect the trial. The blind was not broken for any other patients entered into this study\n\nRandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of inhaled zanamivir in the prevention of progression of influenza A and B viral infections Participants Male or female \u2265 18 years exposed to an index case with symptoms of influenza-like illness within the previous 48 hours\n\nOutcomes Primary outcome: the proportion of patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza during treatment plus at least 2 clinically significant symptoms of influenza of 'moderate' or 'severe' severity during the study treatment period Secondary outcomes: Proportion of patients with a documented fever during the study (temperature > 37.8\u00b0C ) Number of days with any 'moderate' or 'severe' symptoms Number of days overall assessment of symptoms as 'moderate' or 'severe' Number of days with moderate or severe sleep disturbance Number of days patient was unable to perform normal activities Investigator global assessment\n\nStatistical methods section were revised to allow for stratification of vaccinated participants In the efficacy evaluations, nasal symptoms (nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea) were changed to nasal congestion (blocked, runny nose) Safety and non-vaccinated populations were not defined in the protocol \n\nMale or females, aged 13 years and above (aged 16 and above, or aged 18 and above in some centres) with laboratory-confirmed influenza or influenza-like illness as defined by symptoms of feverishness and at least 2 of the following: headache, myalgia, cough, sore throat of less than or equal to 48 hours duration Time (in days from initiation of treatment) to alleviation of individual symptoms of influenza (feverishness, headache, myalgia, cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, weakness and loss of appetite). Alleviation of an influenza symptom was defined as a score of 'none' or 'mild', which had to be maintained over the next 24 hours Time (in days from initiation of treatment) until the patient returned to normal activities. This had to be maintained for the following 24 hours Time (in days from initiation of treatment) until the patient was able to return to usual daily activities and perform these as well as normal Mean symptom score. The 5 symptoms of feverishness, headache, myalgia, cough and sore throat were summarised by the mean symptom score over days 1 to 5 of treatment Number of days over the study period (days 1 to 5) that the patient recorded their overall symptom assessment (OSA) as 'moderate' or 'severe' Number of days over the study period (days 1 to 5) that at least 1 symptom was rated as 'moderate' or 'severe' Number of days over the study period (days 2 to 5) that sleep disturbance was recorded as 'moderate' or 'severe' Maximum daily temperature summarised over the study treatment period (days 1 to 5) Mean daily paracetamol use over the study treatment period (days 1 to 5) Investigator-rated global assessment of symptoms (GAS). The influenza infection status of patients rated by the investigator at the post-treatment visit as 'none', 'mild, 'moderate' or 'severe' Incidence of secondary infections \n\nDue to logistic difficulties in receiving the results of influenza diagnostic tests within 48 hours of influenza symptom onset, some patients were recruited on the basis of a clinical diagnosis of influenza Cough and sore throat were reported as major symptoms in clinical study reports but not in the protocol Protocol amendment 3 necessitated revising the definition of serious adverse events and time line changes for the reporting adverse events. Amendments were also made to definitions for primary and secondary efficacy parameters and statistical analyses were modified Protocol amendment 4 was made to the age range included (13 to 65 years, 16 to 65 years and 18 to 65 years, respectively) and inclusion or exclusion of patients with asthma, to meet local regulatory and ethics committee requirements Study period: May 1995 to May 1996 \n\nBlinding of participants and personnel (performance bias) All outcomes\n\nEach investigator was provided with a sealed envelope containing the individual code-break envelopes for patients in their centres but colour and appearance were not reported; no certificates of analysis were provided\n\nBlinding of outcome assessment (detection bias) All outcomes\n\nLow risk \"...the monitors were blinded as to the study treatment administered.\" No investigator broke the blind for study medication prior to trial completion\n\nRandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre study to investigate the efficacy and safety of inhaled zanamivir administered twice daily in the treatment of influenza A and B viral infections in adults Location, number of centres: Australia (6 centres); New Zealand (4) \n\nwith influenza. Analysis of 'high risk' population restricted to primary endpoint, complications, adverse event incidence and serious adverse event incidence All participants \u2265 65 years were in this population. In addition, conditions thought to predispose patients to greater risk of complications from influenza included concurrent cardiovascular conditions (excluding hypertension), concurrent respiratory conditions (asthmatics excluded if unmedicated), concurrent metabolic conditions and those who were immunocompromised\n\nZanamivir (5 mg per inhalation) 2 inhalations twice a day Placebo 2 inhalations twice a day Treatment period: 5 days Follow-up period: 23 days post-treatment Co-interventions: paracetamol and cough mixture were provided for symptomatic relief Outcomes Primary outcome: time until alleviation of major signs and symptoms of influenza Secondary outcomes: Time to eradication of major signs and symptoms of influenza. Major signs and symptoms of symptoms of influenza were defined as fever, headache, myalgia, sore throat and cough. Eradication was defined as a score of 'none' for all symptoms, which had to be maintained over the next 24 hours Time to alleviation of each of the diary card symptoms calculated separately Time until the patient returned to normal activities. This was defined as the first day on which the patient recorded that they were able to carry out all their usual daily activities. This was required to be maintained for 24 hours (2 consecutive diary card entries) Mean symptom score over post-treatment assessments on days 1 to 5 and on days 1 to 14 Maximum daily temperature, the maximum of the temperatures was obtained for each day. The weighted mean of these values was calculated over the study treatment period. The AUC was calculated using trapezoidal methods Sleep disturbance. The definition of sleep disturbance described in the protocol (i.e. mean number of days when sleep was disturbed 'not at all' or 'slightly') was changed to number of days out of days 2 to 14 for which the patient recorded 'moderate', 'quite a bit' or 'severe' sleep disturbance. This change was made prior to blinding the study and described in the data analysis plan (DAP) Number of tablets of paracetamol taken over the treatment period (days 1 to 5) and days 1 to 14 Number of spoonfuls of cough mixture taken over the treatment period (days 1 to 5) and days 1 to 14 Incidence of complications of influenza and associated antibiotic use Investigator global assessment of symptoms\n\nThe study was conducted by 22 investigators in 3 countries (Australia, New Zealand and South Africa); only 13 of these investigators recruited patients The protocol defined the influenza-positive population as a subset of the intention-totreat population. This was changed in the data analysis plan to be a subset of the safety population. For this study, both populations were the same so the change was irrelevant Investigator global assessment of symptoms was not described in the protocol but planned prior to blinding the study Protocol amendment: \n\nAt 3 Australian centres an additional study protocol was designed to collect pharmacoeconomic data was instigated. This involved interviews with influenza-positive patients after their day 28 visit Study period: recruitment commenced in May 1997 and rolled over to 1998 \n\nRandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre study to investigate the efficacy and safety of inhaled zanamivir (GG167) 10 mg administered twice a day for 5 days in the treatment of symptomatic influenza A and B viral infections in adolescents and adults Location, number of centres: multicentre study in Europe: Belgium (2 centres); Denmark (3); Finland (2); France (10); Germany (5); Holland (1); Italy (2); Norway (7); Spain (1); Sweden (6) All randomised participants, regardless of whether study drug was taken or study completion. Participants who did not take medication to which they were randomised included in treatment group assigned. This was the secondary population for assessing efficacy Safety population (N = 356) All participants who took at least 1 dose of study medication. Participants only excluded from safety population if clear evidence of failure to take study medication. Participants who did not take medication to which they were randomised would have been included in the treatment group of the actual medication they took the majority of the time. This was the primary population for the analysis of safety data High risk (N = 32) Defined as those who could experience more prolonged or severe illness, or suffer complications from influenza due to age or underlying medical condition \n\nTotal number of spoonfuls of supplied cough mixture Global assessment of symptoms at the post-treatment visit Incidence of complications of influenza and associated antibiotic use Notes\n\nProtocol amendments 1. Reference to '5 mL' spoonfuls of dextromethorphan deleted 2. Study personnel recorded whether first dose of study medication given before or after 14:00 hours 3. Secondary complications were to be recorded in the CRF 4. The second diary card including symptom assessments and relief medication use, to be completed twice a day. Questions relating to productivity and normal activities completed once a day 5. Consent form amended to include statement that participant's doctor/nurse would also need to take a throat swab on day 6 6. Categories to be used to document influenza complications were defined 7. Protocol amendment 2 applied to all centres in Denmark, France, Holland, Italy \n\nThere was no significant difference in outcomes between the 2 groups, though a trend in favour of oseltamivir was reported. Secondary outcomes based on diary symptoms appeared to show faster recovery, reduced rate of complications and reduced use of antibiotics in the oseltamivir group. In terms of safety the overall incidence of adverse events was higher in the oseltamivir group than the placebo group (24% versus 21%). This was mainly due to a higher incidence of gastrointestinal events (10% versus 6%), of which vomiting (8% versus 2%) was most significant The definition of the M2 Module itself was not clear in the 614 page PDF reviewed and despite page by page review some things, e.g. the certificates of analysis, were not found and protocol amendments or statistical analysis plan amendments were also not reported. No additional information from M2 changes the original summary and risk of bias Individuals who the investigator diagnosed as having symptoms of influenza A and B by the following criteria: individuals who satisfied the following conditions for influenza infection between the commencement of the symptoms and the first presentation to the participating centre, were willing to participate in the study and could be expected to follow the investigator's orders: 1.

Participation in a clinical study with an investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to screen/study day 1 11. Administration of influenza vaccine less than 12 months prior to study day \n\nParticipants who were discovered to have been infected with laboratory-confirmed influenza ITT population (N = 726) All randomised participants irrespective of influenza status with influenza infection caused by a new human pathogen influenza A/H5N1, of whom 6 have died as a result. This virus, previously associated with avian influenza, has apparently crossed species and resulted in a pathogenic infection in man. The vast majority of influenza infections occurring in Hong Kong at the time of the study were of the non-virulent strain types influenza A/H1N1, H3/N2 or influenza B. However, it was considered that in view of the apparent virulence of the A/H5N1 strain type, participants enrolled into this study, which was placebo-controlled, might be placed at undue risk. This risk was specific to Hong Kong, as this strain type has not so far been identified outside of this region 2. The influenza A/H5N1 virus type is known to be sensitive to amantadine. Throat swabs were taken from all participants entered into the trial prior to the first dose of study drug. In the Hong Kong region, a rapid diagnostic technique (the polymerase chain reaction, PCR) was used to test the swab eluates for the presence or absence of influenza A/H5N1. If any participant was found to be harbouring this strain type, they were to be withdrawn from the study without breaking the blind and offered amantadine at the discretion of the investigator and if the participants condition merited such intervention 3. (16 February 1998) revised the analyses and definition of secondary and tertiary parameters in the study. Following an experiment to assess the use of a standardised protocol for quantitative viral culture, significant variability was detected between the 2 virology laboratories with respect to these assays. Further work continued in order to elucidate the mechanisms of this variability and to further validate the methods. However, due to the lengthy period of time required to complete this work, virus titre was removed as a secondary parameter in this study and the information analysed postdatabase close. The major virology parameter in these studies thus became the duration of virus shedding following inclusion into the trial. It was also believed that peak virus titre might have occurred prior to baseline for a significant number of participants entering the trial and hence this particular parameter was not analysed Study period: December 1997 to April 1998\n\nAuthors' judgement Support for judgement\n\nHigh risk Some discrepancies noted from the Module 2 summary regarding the treatment group assignment of participants experiencing adverse events. This does not necessarily affect the method for generating the randomisation sequence but could affect ITT and safety populations\n\nAllocation concealment (selection bias) Low risk \"The randomisation numbers were generated by a central randomisation service, ICTI (Interactive Clinical Technologies inc., Princeton, NJ, USA).\" \"The investigator telephoned the centre to report the participant's initials, date of birth and smoking history. The randomisation num- ber was then supplied by the centre in the form of a message on an interactive voice response system (IVRS). The investigator entered the randomisation number in the appropriate place on the case report form. \"\n\nIncomplete outcome data (attrition bias) Symptoms High risk Appendix 19 (time to alleviation of all symptoms (ITT population)) has summary info for ITT. However, the extent of missing data is unknown for this outcome Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) Complications of influenza\n\nHigh risk Incomplete outcome data on complications is very likely given the inadequacies present in the way info on complications was collected. In summary, this was to ask patients to self report complications at day 8 and day 21 (follow-up visit at end of the study)\n\nIncomplete outcome data (attrition bias) Safety data\n\nLow risk AEs could be classified as either symptoms of influenza, complications of influenza and AEs. Reporting is inconsistent and some trials reported the same outcome in the same patient in different categories Selective reporting (reporting bias) High risk Secondary illnesses were patient-reported The body of the clinical study reports states that complications requiring antibiotic treatment were specified a priori, but even in the final version of the protocol for which we have the full text, there is no predefined list of secondary illnesses (i.e. no mention of pneumonia, bronchitis, sinusitis or otitis in the protocol), nor did complications have anything to do with antibiotic treatment according to the protocol, nor does the CRF mention specific secondary illnesses by name\n\nIn addition, the protocol does not pre-specify any secondary illnesses. They first appear in the RAP and are in the core report (Module 1). The protocol indicates that the data would be collected, so the absence of mention of secondary illnesses as an outcome (even tertiary) is not easily explicable\n\nIn addition, the decision of ITTI selec- tion for primary outcome for reporting itself may be the selective reporting bias at the start, because this could break the balance between both groups. This bias may have both factor of patient selection (selection bias) and reporting selection (reporting bias), although they were prespecified \n\nAll participants who took 1 dose of the study drug and were subsequently discovered to have laboratory-confirmed influenza Standard population (N not presented) As for the ITTI population, except that this was further restricted to those who took at least 5 doses of the study drug ITT population (N = 615) All participants who took at least 1 dose of the study drug.

Participants were analysed according to treatment received Protocol amendments 1. Protocol WV15819 amendment B and protocol WV15876 amendment B. Originally, symptoms, signs and common sequelae of influenza were to be reported as adverse events. After this protocol amendment, such symptoms, signs and common complications were excluded from reporting as adverse events, unless they fulfilled the criteria for reporting as serious adverse events or the criteria for secondary illness 2. Protocol WV15876 amendment B also added a requirement for male participants whose partners were of childbearing potential to use effective contraception during the study and for 3 months after completing the study, to follow Roche current standard operating procedures 3. Protocol WV15819 amendment D and protocol WV15876 amendment C made changes to the secondary efficacy parameters. The secondary efficacy parameter reflecting the antiviral effect of treatment was changed from the duration of viral shedding to the proportion of participants shedding virus on day 3. This change was made because the intermittent sampling schedule used in the study meant that the true duration of viral shedding could not be assessed exactly, whereas the proportion of participants shedding virus could be determined. The incidence of secondary illnesses requiring antibiotics was included as a new secondary endpoint and the secondary illnesses were defined as sinusitis, LRTI, otitis media, bronchitis and pneumonia. The method of analysis of the proportion of participants shedding virus and for the proportion of participants with predefined secondary illnesses (Fisher's 2-tailed exact test) was added to the statistical methods. Protocol WV15978 included an additional exclusion criterion around previous or concomitant treatment with a neuraminidase inhibitor Study period: Northern Hemisphere centres recruited during flu seasons in 1998 and 1999; Southern Hemisphere centres recruited during flu seasons in 1999 \n\nRandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in residential homes for elderly people. Participants were recruited when a local outbreak was detected, defined as 2 cases in immediate vicinity within 7 days or 1 case in the home itself Location, number of centres: USA (16 centres), UK (1 centre), France (4 centres), Belgium (2 centres) and the Netherlands (3 centres This study was designed to investigate whether oseltamivir suppressed the main clinical symptoms (fever and cough) of patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza. For all time-to-event analyses, time zero was defined as coinciding with the initiation of treatment. For all endpoints defined in this section that involve 'alleviation' of symptoms, alleviation occurred at the start of the 24-hour period in which the symptom was less than or equal to 1 (mild) and remained less than or equal to 1 for at least 24 hours Primary outcome:\n\nThe primary efficacy parameter was the proportion of patients alleviated of cough (none or mild for at least 24 hours) and without fever (37.2\u00b0C or less) at 36 hours after initiation of study medication Secondary outcomes: Symptoms 1. The efficacy parameter to reflect the duration of illness was the length of time until alleviation of all symptoms. This was calculated from Time 0 (study drug initiation) to the length of time over which the area under the curve (AUC) for symptoms was to be calculated. Participants withdrawing prior to alleviation of symptoms were censored at last assessment 2. The efficacy parameter to reflect the extent and severity of illness was the AUC for symptoms. This was calculated from Time 0 (study drug initiation) to the time at which all symptoms were alleviated. Scores were calculated twice daily by totaling the separate symptoms that form the symptom scale. The AUC of these scores was then calculated for each patient using the trapezoidal rule. The baseline for each symptom was defined as the assessment prior to first study drug intake even though this might be before Time 0 3. Proportion of participants who were afebrile (oral temperature 37.2\u00b0C or less) at 24 hours, 36 hours and 48 hours 4. Proportion of patients with fever each day (fever was defined as an oral temperature of 37.8\u00b0C or higher at any assessment during that day) 5. At 12-hourly intervals over the first 2 days, the proportion of patients with alleviation of cough and no fever (37.2\u00b0C or less), with a reduction in \u2265 1 symptom score, with alleviation of cough, with alleviation of myalgia and with alleviation of cough and no fever (38\u00b0C or less)\n\nECGs were collected for a subset of (intensive) patients only, on day 1, day 3 and day 5. Further measurements were to be taken at day 10 or day 21 if abnormal results were observed at the previous visit.

Clinical study reports: Detailed reports of a clinical trial usually submitted to regulators following a prescribed ICH format. Roche's follow a modular structure (see Appendix 11) . Reports can be several hundred pages long and contain details of the planned design, conduct (protocol), analysis (reporting analysis plan or RAP) and results of the trial. Compliharm: Term describing events defined as either complications or harms according to ambiguous criteria that appeared to include time of analysis (with times either unspecified or inconsistent among trials) and whether participants were infected (by influenza) or not. In oseltamivir treatment trials some potential harms or complications could both be caused by medication or influenza infection (e.g. vomiting), hence our classification as a compliharms. Time lock: Date (12 April 2011) after which no documentation would be reviewed in the January 2012 version of the review. A cutoff was made necessary by the sheer scale of our data holdings. We were initially funded to review the full clinical study reports of the 10 treatment trials included in the Kaiser et al paper. We were able to access the 10 Module 1s and regulatory comments (approximately 6000 pages in total). As the funder-stipulated deadline to producing our review progressively shortened and our understanding of the issues evolved we received notification that while the balance of the 10 study reports were unlikely to be accessible by our deadline, we would receive substantial quantities of regulatory documents from the EMA in four tranches. When we held our second face to face meeting in April 2011 we had just received our first tranche of clinical study reports consisting of just over 10 thousand pages, bringing our total holdings to 16,000 pages. We decided that we did not have the resources to review any further documentation within our current funding and imposed a data time lock. Any documentation received after this date would be reviewed if and when we had more resources. The balance of documents (a further 14,000 pages) are included in this review. TOC: Table of content of regulatory reviews and comments on industry submissions. Our TOC indicates which trial is cited in which document on which page how many times. TOCE: Annotated version of the TOC. Comments and annotation are preliminary and form the basis for the weaving of the important aspects into the review narrative. (See also Table 2; Table 3; Table 4 ; Table 5 ). Trial ID: Means of identifying a trial. Usually made up of letters and numbers (WV 15799). At times the ID bears a letter suffix indicating the last version of the protocol followed in the trial (e.g. WV 15799H, i.e. trial carried out following amendment H). Regulatory information: Term comprising clinical study reports (data) and regulatory comments and reviews. Modules: Basic structure of Roche's trial reports see (Appendix 11). Today, the term 'Modules' refers to the components of a regulatory submission, as set by the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) (ICH 2011). Clinical study reports are just one 'Module' of a regulatory submission. accessible on the web. This reported a clinical trial programme of over 60 studies. Searching for an unpublished and hitherto unseen data set requires constructing a reasonably accurate list of all studies of the drug in question. The Roche Investigator's Brochure did not mention some studies we were aware of, and reinforced an idea that we had become clear was essential: the need to develop our own list of trials, because a single, authoritative, up-to-date and complete list of all clinical trials conducted on humans using for both drugs did not seem to exist. When thinking about our next update we decided not to use publications because the majority of treatment trial evidence for Tamiflu remained unpublished, because we had found some discrepancies between CSRs and published equivalents and, mostly, because clinical study reports were so much more detailed and comprehensive than short journal articles, enabling a more thorough critical analysis of the trials. We also decided to expand the scope of A047 by including evidence relating to people of all ages except for immunesuppressed individuals. This, de facto, amounted to the creation of one new review (A159) with a new protocol subsuming A047 and A046. The protocol for A159 was publicly posted in December 2010.\n\nToday the obvious source of information on clinical study reports would be trial registries and company websites, but most trials of both NIs were carried out before inception or wide acceptance of centralised registries and company websites. In 2009-11, company websites did not and still do not have extensive lists of trials with downloadable clinical study reports. Most people had never heard of clinical study reports before media coverage of our efforts. We decided to construct our list by using multiple cross-referencing methods. We constructed a list beginning with clinical trials identified from previous review updates. To this end, we added additional trials in humans from multiple sources, including manufacturer submissions to regulators, drug product information sheets, previous published reviews, Health Technology Assessment (HTA) documents and public and manufacturers' registers (Burch 2009; Cooper 2003; Jefferson 2006; Tappenden 2009; Turner 2003) , such as www.ClinicalTrials.gov and www.roche-trials.com. Regulatory documents also aided the identification of unknown trials. Finally, we also conducted traditional database and grey literature searches (Appendix 5) to identify previously unknown trials. One of the first things we learned was that to ensure the list did not include duplicate entries, we had to assign to each trial a Unique Trial ID. 'Author' is not a good choice of Unique Trial ID, as different authors can be present across different versions of the same trial (that is, the authors of clinical study reports can be different from publications arising from the same clinical trial). Nor are any other details connected to publications a good option for Unique Trial ID because not all studies are published. Some trials will have company-specific codes and some will have public clinical trial registry numbers, or both, or neither. To simplify recognition and terminology we used the manufacturer protocol ID as our Unique Trial ID. Our list was only going to be useful if it had sufficient details to enable us to decide whether it met our inclusion criteria. For each Unique Trial ID, we gathered the following details. 19 . How identified (to record how the trial was discovered) 20. Notes Once we had as complete a list of trials as possible, we contacted manufacturers and sent them our draft list, asking them to check the accuracy and completeness of our list. Roche, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and BioCryst all did so, and in doing so we learned of hitherto unknown trials.\n\nOccasionally, the existence of further unknown trials was detected weeks and months after we thought we had a 'complete' list. This may be inevitable given that trial identification often takes place in unpredictable ways, for example while reading through detailed regulatory reports. We engaged in prolonged correspondence with Roche and GSK and requested a series of regulatory documents under freedom of information policies from both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA). No substantial comments were made by Roche on the protocol of 159 which has been publicly available in one form or another since December 2010. Specifically, we applied to EMA under their new release policy for 26 clinical study reports in their holdings relating to oseltamivir and GSK's zanamivir. The result was the delivery (starting in late March 2011) of 16 clinical study reports, all containing Modules 1 and 2 plus one complete report for oseltamivir (trial WP16263). (See table 1 in Doshi 2012b). None were available for zanamivir, as the EMA had not played a part in its market authorisation. These formed the basis for the 2012 version of A159. At the date of completion of data searches for A159 (12 April 2011), Roche had only provided us with partial clinical study reports despite five requests for full clinical study reports. The material obtained from Roche included the first section (or so-called 'Module 1' or 'Core Report') of a full clinical study report, each of which contain four to five Modules (Appendix 11) for the 10 oseltamivir treatment trials included in the Kaiser 2003 meta-analysis. Not contained in the provided Module 1s are trial protocols with the list of amendments and original reporting analysis plans. These Module 1s comprise 3195 pages. Roche had not made available any further material and indicated it did not intend to answer our requests for clarification on aspects of trials and for availability of the missing parts of complete clinical study reports. In addition we had a 53-page report in English of the treatment trial ML16369, sponsored by Shanghai Roche Pharmaceutical Ltd. Regardless of success with our requests to obtain full clinical study reports, we decided to update our review with available material and subsequently update it as and when additional data became available. Our searches of publication databases did not add any significant information. Following a change of policy at the EMA prompted by similar efforts of the Nordic Cochrane Centre (Gotzsche 2011), we received an additional eight clinical study reports (10,737 pages) in response to a freedom of information request. An additional 14,700 pages of further clinical study reports and 33 pages of regulators' comments arrived after our search deadline. All of the materials received from the EMA are related to oseltamivir. The EMA has no access to information for zanamivir, as it is a nationally authorised product in Europe (correspondence with Xavier Luria, 23 March 2011 and David Mackay 20 July 2011). At present we hold all Module 1s and 2 of oseltamivir trials we have requested. From GSK we have received the promise of individual patient data. Many of the clinical study reports used in this review were obtained via freedom of information requests. We still await an FDA decision regarding similar requests sent to FDA in January 2011. We were able to download 2673 pages of Summary Basis for Approval (SBA) documents from the FDA website, 31 from EMA and 508 pages of Japanese SBA. We indexed the content and then constructed an extended table of contents, giving a summary of each file, thereby facilitating navigation of these complex documents. Once the table of contents had been constructed, we postulated that given the huge work involved in reviewing lots of regulatory files, including clinical study reports, we needed new instruments to indicate which parts were more important than others, thus focusing our efforts. We experimented with a variety of methods reported in the earlier version of the review. We have now devised and used what for us is a satisfactory instrument for critically assessing clinical study reports in their entirety. We intend publishing this separately. The EMA releases, coupled with documents from the FDA SBA for both drugs, formed the basis for the version of A159 that we eventually published in January 2012. The review reported our efforts to get to the bottom of the issue of the effects of NIs by appraising evidence from unpublished clinical study reports (see Glossary (Appendix 1) and regulatory documents containing comments and reviews. We called the body of clinical studies and regulatory comments 'regulatory information' as all of these documents are either created for or by regulators. To our knowledge this was the first Cochrane review ever conducted on the basis of regulatory documents only. Due to funding timelines and the sizeable amount of regulatory information already available to us we decided to review material available as at 12 April 2011. This meant reviewing FDA SBA material and core reports (Module 1s) in our possession from EMA data releases received by this time.\n\nIn 2011 our methods were a mixture of established and novel, reflecting the size of the task, our lack of experience in dealing with large amounts of very detailed regulatory information and the lack of a complete set of clinical study reports. For example, scanning of titles and abstracts was done in double, but selection of studies for inclusion from the list constructed during our search was done in quadruple with disagreements resolved by discussion. For many studies we only had titles and in some cases a very brief description of content, thus we assigned three categories to our trials: 1. definitely included; 2. definitely excluded; and 3. trials for which we needed further information.\n\nWe excluded studies definitely not meeting the inclusion criteria on the basis of the available information (e.g. the title described the trial as a pharmacokinetic study). Where appropriate we requested further information from the trials' sponsor, usually copies of the clinical study reports (minus participant identification) for each trial that was definitely included or for which we needed further information. We did not contact first/corresponding authors of published versions of the trials on the basis of our experience with the 2009 review. Data extraction and management reflected the lack of established methods for reviewing regulatory material. We subdivided the extraction, appraisal and analysis of the data into a two-stage exercise, including studies in the analysis phase only if we judged their reports reliable and complete. To help structure the information we used CONSORT statement-based extraction forms aimed at assembling a concise version of the clinical study reports, which included all important methods as well as defined and extracted all relevant outcomes. We colour-coded the original text to flag up uncertainty or lack of clarity or need for more information from other (then inaccessible) parts of the clinical study report. During this process we excluded all six peramivir trials as we were informed by the manufacturers that no clinical study reports would be available.The 2012 A159 review was based on 15 oseltamivir clinical study core reports and 10 very brief zanamivir study reports. The former came from EMA, while the latter had been part of a GSK submission to the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) which the BMJ had passed onto us together with the SBA material. Our 2010 protocol for A159 was not very detailed on how we would handle this mass of information for the simple reason that no one had ever done it before. We quite literally were learning as we were going along and our understanding of the structure and content of clinical study reports evolved. We created and tested five post-protocol hypotheses (see Appendix 10) , which had originated from the findings in the reports. The best example was our finding of an unnaturally high (up to 80%) influenza positivity rate in treatment trials, which in some cases had been pooled because of lack of viral circulation. We hypothesised that screening for influenza positivity had been carried out prior to enrolment of people with influenza-like illness. This was not borne out by the evidence available to us. We know now that a far simpler explanation is more likely: careful selection of the time period for trial participant enrolment based on when surveillance data suggested high influenza activity led to the recruitment of small numbers of participants from each of many centres with a high likelihood of influenza positivity, but at the time we had limited information available. The 201 2 A159 review analyses were based on the ITT population, which we had found to be the only reliable analysis unit as oseltamivir appeared to have an effect on antibody production in people with influenza, leading to an imbalance in numbers of subjects in the influenza-infected (so-called ITTI) sub-population. This in effect introduced confounding in what otherwise should have been welldesigned double-blind trials. The only effect that was clearly identifiable was a modest shortening of influenza-like illness symptoms by less than a day. This led us to believe that oseltamivir had an aspecific powerful effect on symptoms not mediated by any action on influenza viruses but possibly via an anti-inflammatory mechanism. The trials had been clearly designed with a commercial focus in mind and some of the claims made by the manufacturer (especially on the effect on interruption of transmission and on pneumonia) were not supported by the evidence in our possession. 2012 to the present day Soon after the publication of the review, the BMJ agreed to publish our correspondence with Roche, GSK, EMA, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and WHO, recording our attempts at retrieving the full reports without any conditions attached and to understand the basis for promotion of the drugs (especially oseltamivir) by public health bodies. Before receiving the full reports, we resumed reviewing the remainder of the material we had received in 2011. This mainly consisted of Module 2s (Roche terminology for pre-study documents). Module 2s contained the information originally denied to us by Roche: study protocols with their amendments, randomisation lists, blank case report forms (CRFs), certificates of analysis describing appearance and content of active and control capsules and, at times, statistical analysis plans (SAPs). CRFs are containers for the rawest form of recorded data at the individual participant level. We had no tools for reviewing and synthesising this information, so again we had to create our own. The instrument is made up of three parts each with a separate function. In the first part there is a template for a brief summary description of the trial. The format fits into the RevMan Characteristics of Included Studies (CIST) table and is mainly descriptive. The second part is the appraisal of the trial following the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' format. The third part reconstructs the trial timeline and provides a checklist and position in the document of the various elements such as protocol, protocol amendments and study period with dates. The last part aims to check the internal consistency and coherence of each element (such as numbers screened, numbers randomised, interventions, comparators) across all the different documents, starting from the earliest available version of the protocol. The form also contains suggestions on where to look for the information. This is based on our experience gained in this review and in a descriptive review of 78 clinical study reports of 14 different drugs and biologicals (Doshi 2013). While designing the tool we also asked ourselves whether access to Module 2 information (and later the full study reports) changed our perception of the trial and specifically our 'Risk of bias' assessment. We found that access to what are supposed to be full study reports should provide clarity and remove the rationale for 'unclear' risk of bias judgements and ideally remove the concept of risk leaving just 'bias', at least for certain study design elements such as attrition bias. Either a design element introduces bias or it does not. In the case of the 15 full oseltamivir clinical study reports we reviewed when constructing our tool, only one contained a protocol which predated the beginning of participant enrolment, only two had statistical analysis plans that clearly predated participants' enrolment and three had clearly dated protocol amendments. No clinical study report reported a clear date of unblinding. During the latter part of 2013, we received from the manufacturers tens of thousands of pages of full clinical study reports for both published papers, no complete clinical study reports were publicly available. Therefore, one review author (RH) asked the JMHLW on 29 July 2010 to disclose all documents reporting the evidence base for the approval of oseltamivir for these indications. The JMHLW sent RH a letter of refusal dated 2 September 2010, with the explanation \"because the disclosure of such documents might hurt the right, position or other fair benefit in the competition of the corporation concerned\". We waited six months to take further action hoping that the required clinical study reports would be forthcoming from the manufacturers. When this did not happen, RH filed a suit to overturn the JMHLW decision with the Osaka (Japan) District Court on 28 \n\nParticipant flow (a diagram is strongly recommended)\n\n13a For each group, the numbers of participants who were randomly assigned, received intended treatment and were analysed for the primary outcome Two review authors assessed each study (with studies allocated randomly to three pairs of review authors). The lists of included studies (33 for oseltamivir, 30 for zanamivir, six for peramivir) were randomly created by the program Edgar II (Brown 2011). Every study was openly allocated to each group according to its number. We initially included six peramivir trials in the randomisation/allocation sequence but subsequently decided not to proceed further, as we were informed by the manufacturers that no clinical study reports would be available until after registration with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (correspondence with Bill Sheridan, 20 August 2010). One review author (TJ) was assigned to the attempted reconstruction of clinical study reports from the FDA documents. Two weeks before 'time lock' (see Glossary in Appendix 1) we received the first batch of clinical study reports from the EMA (formerly EMEA), containing an additional four clinical study reports (including one complete four-module clinical study report) of studies we wanted to include. This time random allocation was achieved by writing trial IDs on one set of tickets and asking an external researcher to allocate them to groups, the names of which had been written on another set of tickets. Authors in pairs separately extracted data from the same clinical study reports of studies included in Stage 1 of the review. When we had more than one copy of the same clinical study reports from different sources (for example, clinical study reports submitted to a regulatory body and clinical study reports from a pharmaceutical company), we independently extracted data from each of the copies and then compared the results. We aimed to record and tabulate disagreements between data extracted from the same source and between different sources. We extracted data using a modified CONSORT statement-based extraction template (Appendix 7). The modified CONSORT-based extraction template aimed to assemble a concise version of the clinical study reports, which would include all important methods as well as define and extract all relevant outcomes. The CONSORT-based extraction template includes the features that would be expected to be found in a published trial report but in far greater detail. Our reconstructions do not include introduction or discussion sections. We extracted the following for each trial. the active drug, some adverse events occurring at similar frequencies in different treatment groups could be related to lactose vehicle inhalation\" (FDA 2000b p.10). We reasoned by analogy and reviewed the medication content of the available clinical study reports of oseltamivir trials. The detailed information comparing content and physical characteristics and batch numbers is in Table 17 . Roche's use of the word 'matching' is not strictly correct as two principles present in the placebo capsules (dehydrocholic acid and dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate) are not listed as being present in the active oseltamivir capsules. We could not locate the reason for such a choice in the clinical study reports but both substances may have gastrointestinal action if consumed in large enough quantities. On this basis we formulated two hypotheses: 1a. There is no association between incidence of gastrointestinal harms and a placebo containing dehydrocholic acid in oseltamivir trials. 1b. There is no association between incidence of asthma-related events and a placebo containing lactose powder in zanamivir trials. To test hypothesis 1a we assessed the oseltamivir trials for which we had clinical study reports Module 1 (M76001; WV15670; WV15671; WV15707; WV15812/WV15872; WV15730; WV15819/WV15876/WV15978; WV15758; WV15799) for gastrointestinal tract (GIT) harms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea as well as participants withdrawing from the studies due to adverse events. We meta-analysed the results from these studies using the inverse variance random-effects method. We assessed heterogeneity using the Chi 2 test and used Tau 2 to estimate between-study variance. To investigate whether placebo containing dehydrocholic acid may be associated with gastrointestinal harms we compared adverse event rates in placebo groups from the oseltamivir trials (where placebo contained dehydrocholic acid) with adverse event rates in the placebo groups from the zanamivir trials (where placebo did not contain dehydrocholic acid). This comparison was done informally using 1) data obtained from the FDA labels of oseltamivir and zanamivir (FDA 2000b; FDA 2011a) as well as 2) the trials for which we have clinical study reports. As a sensitivity analysis we assumed a similar gastrointestinal adverse event rate in the placebo groups of the oseltamivir trials as was observed in the placebo groups of the zanamivir trials and then repeated the meta-analysis (as described above). We also speculated that withdrawals in the placebo groups due to gastrointestinal adverse events were possibly related to dehydrocholic acid and removed these for the sensitivity analysis. For hypothesis 1b we assessed asthma-related events in nine zanamivir trials for which we had clinical study reports (NAIA3002; NAIB3002; NAIA2005; NAIB2005; NAIB2007; NAIB3001; NAIA3005; NAI30010; NAI30009). We meta-analysed the results from these studies using the inverse variance random-effects method. We assessed heterogeneity using the Chi 2 test and used Tau 2 to estimate between-study variance. To investigate whether placebo containing lactose powder may be associated with asthma-related events we informally compared event rates in placebo groups from the zanamivir trials (where placebo contained lactose powder) with event rates in the placebo groups from the oseltamivir trials (where placebo did not contain lactose powder). As a sensitivity analysis we assumed a similar asthma-related event rate in the placebo groups of the zanamivir trials as was observed in the placebo groups of the oseltamivir trials and then repeated the meta-analysis (as described above). Hypothesis 2. Oseltamivir (or zanamivir) does not affect antibody production in treatment trials. Rationale. All oseltamivir influenza treatment trials specify the primary efficacy analysis population as the influenza-infected population, not the randomised intention-to-treat (ITT) base population. The influenza-infected population (known as ITTI, or intention-totreat-infected in clinical study reports) is determined post-randomisation based on the results of laboratory testing by culture and/or antibody rise (comparing paired sera from the same participant). The sample for culture and the first sample of sera are taken before commencement of trial product but the second or the third sera are taken after patients are treated with trial medication. It is vital that placebo and active groups of patients have the same odds of being classified as influenza-infected, otherwise any comparison between influenza-infected groups will be potentially affected by bias and will essentially be a non-randomised comparison. If trial medication affects the production of antibodies, the selection of the influenza-infected population (which is partly based on antibody production) is confounded by taking the trial medication. Roche have stated on multiple occasions (Smith 2006; Ward 2005; section 3.2.4.2 Serology WV15799) that ingestion of oseltamivir does not affect antibody production and the FDA supports this, stating that \"In studies of naturally acquired and experimental influenza, treatment with TAMIFLU did not impair normal humoral antibody response to infection\" (FDA 2011a). However, we noticed unequal numbers of individuals in the influenza-infected population subgroup in numerous trials. In addition, Takahashi et al reported that oseltamivir significantly suppressed respiratory mucosal secretory immunoglobulin (Ig) A responses to antigen (Ag)-specific antibody (Ab) production and also the induction of Ag-specific IgA Ab-forming cells in an animal experiment (Takahashi 2010 ). If taking oseltamivir affects the production of IgG antibody as well, it may affect the selection of the influenzainfected population. We are also unsure of the implication for immunisation with influenza vaccine. According to the FDA, no influenza vaccine interaction study has been conducted with oseltamivir (FDA 2011a).\n\nTo test the hypothesis we compared: (1) the odds of participants in the ITT population subsequently classified as influenza-infected; and (2) the odds of participants in the ITT population with a four-fold or more rise of antibody between the placebo and active arms of the trials. If ingestion of oseltamivir does not affect antibody production then we expect the odds of being classified as influenzainfected to be the same for the placebo and active arms. Therefore, we tested a null hypothesis that the odds of having a four-fold or more rise of antibody was the same for the placebo and active arms. We meta-analysed the results from these studies using the inverse variance random-effects method. We assessed heterogeneity using the Chi 2 test and used Tau 2 to estimate between-study variance. The trials included in this analysis were the 10 oseltamivir treatment trials analysed by Kaiser 2003 plus WV15758 for oseltamivir and NAIA3002, NAIB3002, NAIA2005, NAIB2005, NAIB2007, NAIB3001, NAI30009 for zanamivir. These are all the treatment trials for which we have clinical study reports Module 1. In an additional analysis we also assessed the oseltamivir trial conducted in China by Shanghai Roche Pharmaceutical Ltd for which we have a partial clinical study report (ML16369). Hypothesis 3. Oseltamivir does not affect antibody production in post-exposure (or secondary prophylaxis) trials. Rationale. According to the clinical study report of WV15799, the trial programme assessing the effects of oseltamivir in post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) consisted of two trials: WV15799 and WV16139. The Module 1s of both trials together with copious FDA notes on trial WV15799 were available to us at 'time lock'. However the PEP trial WV16139 was not standard care or placebo-controlled and so we excluded it from the review. WV15799 was a double-blind, cluster-randomised trial in which contact clusters of index cases were randomised to oseltamivir 75 mg a day or placebo for seven days. The trial formed an integral part of the \"pivotal\" trials package for the supplementary application and review for prophylaxis use of oseltamivir 75 mg in people aged more than 13 years of age, submitted to the FDA on 22 May 2000, approved on 20 November 2000 (FDA 2000c). In the clinical study report Module 1 the manufacturer claimed that the trial provided evidence of the drug's capacity to prevent influenza in contacts by interrupting its transmission from index cases. Since all index cases were left untreated except for a paracetamol rescue pack, it is hard to see how such a claim can be made. The interruption of transmission claim has two components: reduction of viral spread from index cases (measured by nasal shedding of influenza viruses) and prevention of onset of influenza in contacts. This latter claim was based on the definition of (prevented) influenza cases: a mixture of symptoms signs and 'laboratory confirmation' (i.e. viral culture from the upper airways and/or at least a four-fold rise in antibody titres measured between baseline and two to three weeks later). The results of the trial later formed the basis for claims of the drug's effectiveness in interrupting transmission from person to person (WHO 2007) and allow time before the arrival of vaccines in the event of a pandemic. The interruption of transmission claim provided a powerful rationale for stockpiling oseltamivir (see for example vol 8, p.61-62 NICE 2000: \"Ro 64-0796 successfully interrupts the transmission of influenza within households ... and suggests that Ro 64-0796 [oseltamivir] would control the spread of influenza in other closed communities associated with high risk of transmission, such as nursing homes\" \u2026 \"Ro 64-0796 also effectively interrupted virus transmission within households.\") The interruption of transmission indication was accepted by agencies such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), but the US FDA refused to register and allow publicity based on any further indication beyond treatment and prophylactic effects on symptoms (FDA 2000f). Review of the evidence from the study protocol and Module 1 together with the FDA criticism explains the rationale for the FDA not supporting the manufacturers' claims. The design of the trial did not allow for comparison of the effects of treating index cases with oseltamivir versus placebo (as all index cases were not medicated) and a repeat viral culture was not performed for all participants. Viral culture was performed at baseline for all participants and thereafter only in participants with influenza-like illness symptoms (see Schedule of assessment for the contact case, WV15799, and the FDA Medical Officer report (FDA 1999c)). Any participants presenting at follow-up with symptoms of influenza had throat and nasal swabs taken in order to confirm the presence or absence of influenza infection (FDA 2000c), thereby missing out on potential asymptomatic infected people. However, a recent review of transmission studies has found no convincing evidence of spread from presymptomatic or asymptomatic subjects (Patrozou 2009), which might explain the FDA's caution in sanctioning any such claim for oseltamivir. Our review of the clinical study report's Module 1 identified further problems with the conduct and reporting of the trial and discrepancies both within the clinical study reports and between the study and its protocol. In the protocol (version H) there is no mention of viral shedding measurement. This appears to be a post-protocol addition, which would explain the unsystematic nature of the viral excretion measurement remarked on by the FDA (i.e. taken from symptomatic contacts only). The primary population of analysis is the so called ITTIINAB population (contacts of ITT influenza-infected index cases who had negative virology at baseline). Although defined in the protocol, the selection and presentation of results for the intention-to-treat contacts of the influenza-infected index case not infected at baseline (ITTIINAB) population has the effect of excluding 57% of the placebo (200/456) and 59% of the oseltamivir (205/497) participants. The effect of selection on the clustering was not formally tested in a sensitivity analysis. Nor is the potential weakness of such a choice discussed in the WV15799 clinical study report. We carried out an analysis using Fisher's exact test, which showed that there was no statistical evidence that the placebo and oseltamivir groups' cluster sizes were distributed differently based on households with an infected index case (P = 0.56) ( Table 2) . By analysing the population by influenza status of the index case, instead of unit of randomisations (all index cases), the beneficial effects of the cluster-randomisations are potentially lost, introducing unknown biases into the analysis. In addition, the generalisability of the conclusions may not be easily applied to clinical practice where testing of suspected influenza cases is often not practical. Cross-checking the definition of ITTIINAB with that reported in the protocol of the other PEP trial, WV16193 (excluded from this review) yields a different definition (PDF page 589) \"The primary outcome in this study (WV15799) was the incidence of influenza occurring among contacts of influenza-infected index cases (the intent-to-treatindex-infected population)\". Throughout the clinical study report of trial WV15799 there are many other apparently contradictory statements on important aspects of the trial, for example, on how many viral swabs and paired sera tests were carried out. The text at page 50 of the Module 1 reports that \"For 21 of the 26 contacts with laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza in the ITTIINAB population the diagnosis was confirmed by culture\" but Table 19 shows the 26 contacts as shedding virus at days two to eight. The same table reports that 178 placebo contacts and 201 oseltamivir contacts were negative for virology (which suggests that they were tested) at days two and eight. However, viral testing only took place at baseline and thereafter only in symptomatic participants. The number of contacts in which influenza was diagnosed only by serology is unclear but it appears to be five (26 minus 21) . These inconsistencies highlight one of the fundamental conceptual problems in understanding the whole oseltamivir prophylaxis trial programme: the mode of action of the drug. Our interpretation of the text suggests that oseltamivir does not prevent infection and does not affect influenza antibody response. As stated above, the claim that oseltamivir does not affect antibody responses has been made by the manufacturers. However, an antibody response is part of the definition of influenza. We are unsure how it is possible that oseltamivir could prevent influenza by stopping symptoms appearing and antibodies rising while at the same time leaving antibody production unaffected. It is for this reason that we decided to test whether administration of oseltamivir for PEP affected the production of antibodies to influenza viruses. The distribution of change in antibodies from baseline to follow-up was compared between the arms of the trials for contacts of the index cases. Analysis was performed using Wilcoxon two-sample test separately for each type of antibody in each trial. An additional analysis of proportion of contacts having a four-fold or greater rise in influenza-specific antibody titre in antibodies was compared between groups using the Chi 2 test. Antibody data were not available for index cases, who were left untreated. In WV15799, antibody testing may have been undertaken at day 1, day 8 and at day 21 \u00b1 4 days for all contacts. Day 8 blood samples for influenza antibody analysis were stored to measure influenza antibody levels only in those contacts who did not attend the follow-up visit (day 17 to 25). Analysis was based on data from the ITTIINAB population at pages 59-60 and Appendix 60 of the clinical study report's Module 1. Hypothesis 4. The number of trial centres and centre withdrawals does not affect the proportion of placebo patients subsequently diagnosed with influenza infection (originally the outcome was effect size) and Hypothesis 5. In oseltamivir treatment trials there is no association between the order of randomisations and naso-pharyngeal swabbing (i.e. randomising participants first and then swabbing or swabbing first and then randomising) and the proportion of placebo patients subsequently diagnosed with influenza infection (originally the outcome was effect size). Rationale. The proportion of ITT population in the treatment trials of NIs that are subsequently diagnosed as infected with influenza is higher (~50% to 80%) than is usually seen in the course of the winter season in routine clinical care, although high peaks can occur for a very limited period. We know that in some treatment trials, such as WV15670 and WV15671, centres were activated to \"recruit subjects during an influenza outbreak in the locality, detected using standardised surveillance techniques.\" We postulated that unreported procedures may also have been used in the trials to obtain these high proportions of influenza to ILI cases. Two procedures that may have been used are: 1) use of rapid influenza tests to screen out patients based on negative results; 2) dropping of centres that recruited low proportions of infected patients. The use of rapid testing of patients prior to randomisation has been reported in at least one of the zanamivir treatment trials (NAIB3001), in oseltamivir trial WV15670 as a means of excluding infection with H5N1 in the Hong Kong Centre, as a pilot surveillance in suburban London during the 1998 to 1999 winter (NICE 2000 vol.1) and in most oseltamivir paediatric trials to exclude respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. In addition, the schedule of testing varies by trial for the oseltamivir trials with swabbing performed either before randomisation or after randomisation. In at least one oseltamivir treatment trial (WV15730) it was reported that no viral culture was performed at centres from South America (FDA 1999c). As a result of these observations we reformulated Hypothesis 4 as follows: the number of centres and centre withdrawals does not affect the proportion of placebo patients subsequently diagnosed with influenza infection (originally the outcome was primary outcome effect size) in oseltamivir treatment trials and Hypothesis 5 as in oseltamivir treatment trials there is no association between the order of randomisations and naso-pharyngeal swabbing (i.e. randomising participants first and then swabbing or swabbing first and then randomising) and the proportion of placebo patients subsequently diagnosed with influenza infection. To test hypothesis 4, we used Spearman's rank method to estimate the correlation between average number of patients recruited per centre and the proportion of placebo patients subsequently diagnosed with influenza infection. The placebo patients were used for the proportion of patients subsequently diagnosed with influenza infection because, as we show later in the review, there is evidence that oseltamivir interferes with antibody production and antibody response was used to diagnose influenza infection. We did not analyse the number of centres dropped from studies because information on this variable was not available in Module 1s of the clinical study reports for the included trials (information on patients recruited to each centre is reported in Module 2 which we do not currently have access to). Hypothesis 5 was generated to attempt to explain the seemingly high proportion of influenza-infected influenza-like illness cases in treatment trials. However, we did not formally test this hypothesis as there was only one clinical study report reporting randomisation first then swabbing second (WV15819/WV15876/WV15978) (see also Appendix 10) .\n\nThe results of our post-protocol analyses are also reported in Figure and/or Table format. Hypothesis 1a tested in a sensitivity analysis whether the incidence of gastrointestinal harms may be associated with exposure of participants to a placebo containing dehydrocholic acid. The data obtained from the oseltamivir trials clinical study reports is shown in Table 15 . Overall, the crude adverse event incidence in the placebo groups of the oseltamivir trials was 5.5% for nausea, 3.6% for vomiting and 7.0% for diarrhoea. This compares with crude incidence in the nine zanamivir treatment trials' placebo groups of 4.1% for nausea and vomiting (reported as a combined outcome in the clinical study reports) and 2.8% for diarrhoea. Two studies (WV15670; WV15671) compared three treatment groups: oseltamivir 150 mg bid, oseltamivir 75 mg bid and placebo. To maintain the blinding in these trials, each participant took two pills twice daily. Therefore the participants in the oseltamivir 75 mg bid group took one placebo tablet twice daily. We note that in trial WV15671 there was evidence of a dose-response effect of placebo on incidence of diarrhoea: oseltamivir 150 mg bid (5.9%), oseltamivir 75 mg bid (8.7%) and placebo (11.8%) (P = 0.036). However, there was no evidence found of a similar trend in trial WV15670 (P = 0.88). We were unable to carry out a similar analysis for paediatric treatment trial WV15758 because a detailed content of the placebo preparations is not available (see Table 17 ). Random-effects meta-analysis of the data in Table 15 provided the following results. Nausea: increased odds of adverse events due to oseltamivir (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.26, P = 0.004). Vomiting: increased odds of adverse events due to oseltamivir (OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.62 to 3.31, P < 0.001). Diarrhoea: decreased odds of adverse events due to oseltamivir (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.97, P = 0.03). Withdrawal from treatment due to adverse events: no evidence of a difference between treatment groups (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.76, P = 0.75). We carried out a sensitivity analysis by assuming placebo rates of gastrointestinal adverse events in oseltamivir trials based on those observed in placebo groups of similar zanamivir trials. Overall rates of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea in placebo groups of zanamivir treatment trials for adults and adolescents were 3%, 2% and 4% compared to oseltamivir treatment trials for adults and adolescents where rates were 6%, 3% and 10% respectively based on FDA-reported data (FDA 2000b; FDA 2011a). Conversely, other common adverse events such as headaches, cough and dizziness had similar incidences of 2% to 3% in the placebo groups of zanamivir and oseltamivir treatment trials (FDA 2000b; FDA 2011a). In the treatment trials of children the rates of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea in placebo groups of zanamivir treatment trials were 2%, 3% and 2% compared to oseltamivir treatment trials of children where rates were 4%, 9% and 11% respectively. Our conservative estimate is that the oseltamivir placebo increased rates of nausea two-fold (risk ratio (RR) = 2), vomiting (RR 1.5) and diarrhoea (RR 2.5) compared to the placebo arms in zanamivir trials. Based on the adult and adolescent trials we could conservatively speculate that the substances in the oseltamivir trials placebo increase nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea by 100% (6%/3%), 50% (3%/2%) and 150% (10%/4%) respectively. This could also be considered a conservative assumption because it is plausible that the lactose powder used as the placebo in the zanamivir trials also induced gastrointestinal symptoms, especially in patients that were lactose intolerant. Adjusting the actual rates of these events in the oseltamivir trials placebo groups to be consistent with the zanamivir trials placebo group rates (as reported by the FDA (FDA 2000b; FDA 2011a) and rerunning the random-effects meta-analysis we obtained the following results. Nausea: increased odds of adverse events due to oseltamivir (OR 3.33, 95% CI 2.44 to 4.54, P < 0.001; test for heterogeneity P = 0.33). Vomiting: increased odds of adverse events due to oseltamivir (OR 3.46, 95% CI 2.51 to 4.78, P < 0.001; test for heterogeneity P = 0.37). Diarrhoea: increased odds of adverse events due to oseltamivir (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.50, P < 0.001; test for heterogeneity P = 0.50). The estimated effect sizes for nausea and vomiting have increased based on the sensitivity analysis. The effect on diarrhoea has reversed, indicating oseltamivir is possibly associated with increased odds of this adverse event. The results of our analysis support an alternative interpretation to that of the FDA. Finally, we carried out a sensitivity analysis of withdrawal from treatment due to adverse events by assuming no withdrawals due to gastrointestinal events in the placebo group. In total there were nine patients in the oseltamivir trials' placebo groups that withdrew due to gastrointestinal events. When these withdrawals are not included the following result is obtained based on random-effects metaanalysis:\n\nWithdrawal from treatment due to adverse events: no evidence of a difference between treatment groups (OR 1.48, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.51, P = 0.15; test for heterogeneity P = 0.40). We conclude that participants in placebo arms of oseltamivir treatment trials experience a higher rate of gastrointestinal adverse events compared to their zanamivir counterparts. As the zanamivir trials' inclusion criteria were similar to the oseltamivir trials (fever and two additional symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI)) this observation cannot plausibly be explained by an incremental role of influenza infection in the genesis of such heterogeneity. It is possible that the difference in reported gastrointestinal adverse events in the placebo groups of zanamivir and oseltamivir trials is due to differences in the collection of these events. However, other common adverse events such as headaches, cough and dizziness had very similar rates in the placebo groups of zanamivir and oseltamivir trials. Despite the results of this sensitivity analysis it is impossible without a clear statement of dosage and rationale of use to assess the role of dehydrocholic acid and possibly calcium phosphate in the causation of such a high incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events. For hypothesis 1b the data obtained from the zanamivir treatment trials clinical study reports are shown in Table 16 . Over all the nine zanamivir trials the incidence of asthma (including asthma exacerbation) in the placebo groups was 2.1% compared to 0.9% in the placebo groups of the oseltamivir trials. Random-effects meta-analysis of the data in Table 16 provided the following results for the combined outcome of any asthma event: Asthma: decreased odds of adverse events due to zanamivir (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.86, P = 0.01). We carried out a sensitivity analysis by assuming placebo rates of asthma-related adverse events in zanamivir trials based on those observed in similar oseltamivir trials. If we assume a rate of asthma events in the placebo groups of the nine zanamivir trials similar to that observed in the oseltamivir trials we obtain the following result based on random-effects meta-analysis: Asthma: no evidence of a difference between treatment groups (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.26, P = 0.42; test for heterogeneity P = 0.68). We conclude that zanamivir trial placebo recipients appear to have a higher incidence of asthma-related events than their oseltamivir counterparts. Again, as the inclusion criteria were similar for both trial programmes this finding is not likely to be due to severity of influenza infections but associated with exposure to lactose powder and possibly to the active principle. This is a point remarked on by the FDA. For hypothesis 2 (oseltamivir (or zanamivir) does not affect antibody production in treatment trials) the relevant trials showed strong and consistent evidence that patients randomised to active treatment had reduced odds of being classified as influenza-infected (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.94, P = 0.003) with no evidence of heterogeneity (heterogeneity Chi 2 test = 2.80 (df = 7) P = 0.90; estimate of between-study variance Tau 2 = 0.00) (see Table 17 ). There was also strong evidence that patients randomised to active treatment had reduced odds of having four-fold or higher rise in antibody titres (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.90, P < 0.001) with no evidence of heterogeneity (heterogeneity Chi 2 test = 4.61 (df = 7) P = 0.71; estimate of between-study variance Tau 2 = 0.00) (see Table 17 ). In contrast, the zanamivir trials showed no evidence that patients randomised to active treatment had reduced odds of being classified as influenza-infected (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.24, P = 0.52) with no evidence of heterogeneity (heterogeneity Chi 2 test = 3.03 (df = 6) P = 0.81; estimate of between-study variance Tau 2 = 0.00) (see Table 18 ). These results have important implications for the oseltamivir treatment trials programme and for all ongoing trials. All influenzainfected populations are selected post-randomisation and post-trial termination on the basis of laboratory findings (all ITT participants being symptomatic at entry, with aetiology unknown). However, as oseltamivir appears to affect antibody production (or perhaps testing, or both), there may be some participants in the oseltamivir group who were infected with influenza but not diagnosed by the antibody rise and were therefore not counted in the influenza-infected population. These may have subsequently been excluded from the efficacy analysis. It is also possible that the strength of the antibody production limit to qualify for an influenza infection-induced antibody rise (four-four fold and above from baseline) had the effect of selecting the 'stronger' responders into the influenza-infected subgroup of the oseltamivir arm. This would mean that the best antibody producers were selected and this may have led to inflated treatment estimates of efficacy in influenza-infected populations. To investigate this possibility we calculated the correlation between the odds of being classified as infected in the oseltamivir group compared to the placebo group and the size of the primary treatment effect (time to alleviation of symptoms in the ITTI population). In treatment trials all participants are recruited on the basis of symptoms of influenza-like illness. According to the mechanism of action proposed by the manufacturer, infected participants given oseltamivir up to 48 hours from symptom onset should have an antibody response which, given the effects of randomisation, should be similar to that of placebo recipients. Non-responders or weak responders should be spread evenly across the trial arms. All treatment trials of oseltamivir showing evidence of a treatment effect on the primary outcome of the study were included in the analysis. This included two trials for which we did not have clinical full study reports (ML16369; JV15823). We included these trials to increase variation in the two variables used for the analysis. In addition, two trials were excluded: WV15707 which had a total ITTI sample size of 12 participants; and WV15812/WV15872, which was a treatment trial in chronically ill adults that showed no evidence of a treatment effect. Results showed strong evidence of a correlation (Spearman rank correlation = -0.83, P = 0.01) ( Table 19 ). The correlation was highly negative, indicating that lower odds of being classified as ITTI in the oseltamivir group compared to the placebo group is associated with larger treatment effects for the primary outcome of the studies. In contrast, there was no evidence of a correlation between the odds of being classified as infected in the oseltamivir group compared to the placebo group (Table 19 ) and the size of the treatment effect in the ITT population (Spearman rank correlation = -0.23, P = 0.66). A limitation of this analysis is that data for the ITT population for two trials were not available (WV15730; JV15823) (Table 19) . Thus, all influenza-infected comparisons are potentially confounded by the action of the drug (oseltamivir but probably not zanamivir) and are essentially non-randomised comparisons. Any analyses should be based on ITT populations in oseltamivir treatment trials. Analyses and data considered for inclusion in systematic reviews should be based on the ITT (or safety) populations only. Our analysis of Hypothesis 3 shows that the odds of having a four-fold rise in antibodies is 0.33 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.67) for the oseltamivir group compared to placebo (hence a much bigger effect compared to the treatment trials). Due to insufficient information provided in the clinical study report we were unable to take account of the clustering in this analysis, hence the confidence intervals are possibly under-estimated; however an analysis that takes into account clustering is unlikely to change the conclusions. These results show that oseltamivir prophylaxis is associated with lower odds of a four-fold rise in antibodies and this appears to be due to a difference in the distribution of antibody rise in HIAAH3 antibodies but not HIAAH1 or HIB antibodies (see Table 16 , Table 21 , Table 22 and Table 23 ). In summary no conclusions can be drawn from the available evidence on the effects of the drug on viral transmission. The mode of action in prophylaxis appears mainly to be ascribed to symptom suppression or control. There is uncertainty around other possible effects of the drug especially given its interaction with the production of antibodies. We rejected Hypothesis 4 and are currently unable to test Hypothesis 5 We rejected Hypothesis 4 as there was no evidence of correlation between average recruited subjects per centre and the proportion of placebo patients subsequently diagnosed with influenza infection (Spearman correlation = 0.26; P = 0.53). Table 24 shows that the average recruited participants per centre ranged from 2 to 11 which appears very low for international, multicentre trials. Two studies failed to reach their recruitment target (WV15707 and WV15730) and two clinical study reports were made up of multiple trials due to the original trial's poor recruitment (WV15819/WV15876/WV15978 and WV15812/WV15872) (Table 24 ). In addition the proportion of placebo patients subsequently diagnosed with influenza infection ranged from 63% to 75%, implying little betweentrial variation. We are currently unable to test Hypothesis 5 as only one oseltamivir clinical study report (of three trials) reported randomisation first then swabbing second (WV15819/WV15876/WV15978). In this study the proportion of placebo patients that were confirmed as influenza-infected was 68.1%. This compares with the other seven clinical study reports where swabbing was carried out first and randomisation second and the proportion of placebo patients that were confirmed as influenza-infected ranged from 63.2% to 74.9% with mean 68.1%. Hence it seems that swabbing after randomisation made no difference in the treatment trial programme where this practice is reported. However, with only one clinical treatment study report randomising prior to swabbing available to us, the power to detect a difference in the proportion of placebo patients subsequently diagnosed with influenza infection is low. We hope to be able to retest this hypothesis as more data become available. The title confused me: I expected it to be a review of unpublished trials to complement your review of published trials. It would be longer but clearer if you could call it \"Neuraminidase inhibitors for preventing and treating influenza in healthy adults and childrena review of clinical study reports for published and unpublished trials\".\n\nThe section \"How the intervention might work\" could be reorganized along the lines of: 0) Metabolism: oseltamivir phosphate (OP), Tamiflu, is the pro-drug of oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), the effective form. OP dissociates in the gastrointestinal tract to form oseltamivir (OT) which is absorbed and metabolised into OC by hepatic carboxylesterase (h-CE). \u2022 Trials with no events. As stated above the RevMan software automatically adds 0.5 to each cell of the 2\u00d72 table for any such study.\n\n\u2022 Sensitivity analyses. We note this point and agree. Where appropriate, a realistic sensitivity analyses will be conducted.\n\nFeedback from Wolfgang Becker-Brueser, 30 January 2012 Summary Dear Tom Jefferson, I read your review about NI for prevention and treating influenza with interest. It's an important work. In the chapter \"Why it is important to do this review\" I found a small mistake concerning the worldwide stockpiling of oseltamivir which is mentioned to be \"CHF 7.6 billion worth of oseltamivir (JACK 2009)\". This would be an enormous amount \"prior (!) to the emergence of influenza A/H1N1 in 2009\". But Andrew JACK wrote in the cited Financial Times (May 13, 2009): \"Governments around the world had stockpiled 220m treatments to date, swelling sales since the start of 2003 to SFr7.6bn, largely on the basis of preparation for a pandemic virus that has yet to appear.\" So 7.6 billion SFr represent sales and not stockpiling. Wolfgang Becker-Brueser (physician and pharmacist)\n\nThank you. The extent of stockpiling is a closely guarded secret this is why these are estimates. We will probably never know.\n\nSummary I am writing to comment on the recently updated meta-analysis by Jefferson and colleagues published through the Cochrane Collaboration and to request clarifications on several points, as well as to suggest some additional analyses that would be helpful in terms of taking greater advantage of this useful database. While I fully support access of Jefferson and other interested investigators to all of the published and unpublished data from the RCTs of oseltamivir and zanamivir for further analyses, this analysis only focuses on RCTs in ambulatory patients with uncomplicated influenza (the vast majority of whom were previously healthy) and on the period before the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Consequently, I would urge these investigators to extend their efforts to other populations and datasets examining the risks and benefits of using neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) for treatment and prophylaxis. Furthermore, the authors should acknowledge the limitations of their analyses more explicitly and avoid inappropriate extrapolation to populations and influenza events that the RCTs did not adequately address. Differences in disease pathogenesis related to virus and host factors, as well as time to treatment, have important effects on the utility of antiviral agent interventions. My specific comments and recommendations for additional analyses follow: 1. Use of Intention to Treat (ITT) and ITTI-Infected Groups. The exclusive focus in the current treatment analysis on the ITT population is a readily rectified shortcoming. Outcomes in all three groups of relevance (ITT, ITT-infected, and ITT-noninfected) should be presented, so that readers can examine both clinical effectiveness and efficacy for the key endpoints, as well as events in those without documented influenza. Because NAI treatment would not be expected to provide any benefit in non-influenza illness, not presenting the ITT-infected outcomes in the analysis underestimates possible beneficial drug effects. Assessment of the noninfected group provides a valuable control and also enables a determination of whether there was a potential drug-disease adverse interaction of NAI treatment in non-influenza patients. Of note, our earlier pooled analysis of physician-diagnosed lower respiratory tract complications leading to antibiotic use found a significant benefit of oseltamivir in the influenza-infected patients but not in those enrolled in whom influenza infection was not detected by culture or serology ]. 2. Sample size considerations. Severe outcomes of influenza infection are sufficiently uncommon in previously healthy people that even large RCTs or combining multiple RCTs would be very unlikely to detect them with confidence. The same point applies to very uncommon endpoints like microbiologically documented bacterial complications and rare adverse effects of treatment. Consequently, conclusions that there is no evidence (from trials) that NAIs reduce the risk of pneumonia, hospitalisations, deaths are overstated, as the evidence considered in this analysis is insufficient to properly address these questions. The US CDC has estimated age-related influenza-related hospitalisation and mortality rates for both seasonal epidemics and the 2009 pandemic [Shrestha 2011 ]. Jefferson and colleagues should use such event estimates and others to make calculations of the necessary sample sizes to detect reductions in these severe outcomes with NAI therapy in a controlled RCT across a range of clinically relevant effect sizes (e.g., 20%, 35%, 50% reductions). In a related fashion, they should also provide more quantitative estimates for their ability to detect such outcomes with their existing database and comment more precisely on their power to capture particular endpoints. 3. Complications in ambulatory patients. Other clinically relevant endpoints in these previously healthy and at-risk persons warrant investigation. With regard to influenza-related complications, the most frequent in previously healthy children and adults are respiratory tract infections (otitis media, bronchitis) leading to antimicrobic use. These are usually not severe and typically not microbiologically documented with respect to etiologies but physician-diagnosed complications leading to antibiotic use is an outcome that has important clinical and public health implications (i.e., cost, antibiotic resistance, side effects) and also is sufficiently frequent to demonstrate effects of antivirals. We showed such a benefit in adults in our earlier pooled analyses of the then available RCT data on inhaled zanamivir ] and oral oseltamivir ]. The oseltamivir effect was confirmed in a recent meta-analysis ], and another recent Cochrane report confirms an effect on otitis media in children [Wang 2011 ]. Given the large amount of data available to the investigators, it would be a valuable contribution to also explore the clinical outcomes in greater detail and to clarify the use of terms like severe outcomes. Although uncommon in the populations enrolled in these RCTs, endpoints such as radiographically documented pneumonia, microbiologically documented infections, and hospitalisation or death are clear and should be listed separately in those with or without proven influenza infection. Because of the importance of hospitalisations as an endpoint, it would be helpful to examine not only all-cause hospitalisations but also relevant subgroups based on likely causation (e.g., events in which influenza was documented or likely implicated including exacerbations of co-morbidities vs others like accidents, elective surgeries, conditions unlikely to be influenza-related). In addition to these events, exacerbations of underlying conditions (e.g., asthma, COPD, diabetes, CHF) are of medical importance in influenza outpatients with co-morbidities and should be examined. 4. Data from observational studies. Typically the patients who are most at risk of severe outcomes (older people, infants and young children, those with underlying chronic conditions) are not included in RCTs. In this regard, the current analysis is limited to placebo-or active-controlled RCTs largely done in previously healthy persons and does not consider the multiple observational studies from different countries that have consistently showed protective effects against severe outcomes like pneumonia and hospitalisation, particularly in those with co-morbidities, as well as reduced mortality if patients have been hospitalised. A considerable amount of new treatment data was generated in many countries during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic that found timely NAI treatment to be associated with a lower risk for intensive care admission and death (reference list available upon request). While such data and analyses are weaker than RCT data and subject to bias, these observational studies address key endpoints in at-risk and seriously ill populations, including patients admitted to a hospital at the time of initiating therapy, that the available RCTs cannot and do not address. Furthermore, the standard of care has evolved such that placebo-controlled RCT in such patient groups would not be acceptable to investigators or ethics committees. The decision by Jefferson and colleagues not to consider and critically analyse the large amount of observational data with modern techniques means that they are not incorporating key information and many important patient groups in which the available data suggests medically important benefits from early NAI therapy. Such findings from observational data can inform antiviral treatment in more severely ill patients when no other data are available. As discussed above, not to include observational data means that conclusions of no effect on uncommon events or no severe adverse events being detected are almost inevitable. This should be made explicit in the design and the conclusion of the current report. 4. Influenza diagnosis and serologic results. The Jefferson report raises questions about the possible inhibitory effects of oseltamivir therapy on influenza-specific serologic rises and introduction of bias into the outcomes analysis. Further analyses might help to assess these possibilities. They should compare the primary endpoint of illness alleviation between the oseltamivir and placebo subgroups that were culture-positive (irrespective of serologic findings) at enrolment, and separately those that were culture-negative but had serologic evidence of infection. Of note, one prior study of oseltamivir treatment in pandemic 2009 H1N1 patients, although not in seasonal influenza patients, suggested that early treatment could reduce antibody responses [Cowling 2010 ]. Jefferson and colleagues should examine the agerelated frequencies of HAI seroconversions and the GMT titre rises in those with influenza-culture positive illness and separately in those with such HAI rises in absence of culture positivity. Of course, if still available, it would be interesting to test the culture-negative enrolment samples by RT-PCR. The RCT data were generated over multiple seasons in which different influenza A and B viruses were circulating. Influenza B neuraminidases are generally less susceptible to oseltamivir carboxylate and several observational studies indicate that oseltamivir is less effective in influenza B-than influenza A-infected children [Sugaya 2007; Sato 2008 ]. It would be useful to examine the primary outcome in relation to virus type (A vs. B) and if possible A subtype (H3 vs. H1) in those with documented infections to expand on this point. 5. Other treatment endpoints of interest. Since those enrolled in the RCTs were outpatients, it would be useful to explore other endpoints that reflect patient recovery and impacts on the healthcare system (e.g., nonscheduled return visits for complications or adverse events). Perhaps more important than the time to alleviation endpoint used in the registrational trials might be the times to resumption of usual activities and return to pre-morbid status. The authors raise the possibility that oseltamivir might have non-specific antipyretic effects, and one animal model study has also suggested possible adverse immunomodulatory effects of oseltamivir in RSV infection ]. Consequently, it would be interesting to examine the course of fever resolution (a much earlier event than cough resolution) and of symptoms in oseltamivirand placebo-treated patients with and without documented influenza infections. In addition, it would be valuable to examine the correspondence (or lack thereof ) between influenza virologic measures (e.g., enrolment virus titre, time to culture negativity, change in viral titres over time) and symptom resolution measures in both oseltamivir and placebo groups. Various cost-effectiveness analyses on NAI therapy in low-risk populations have been published with widely divergent outcomes, largely depending on the input assumptions. Using this large database, a more refined analysis that incorporates both the direct and indirect (productivity losses) costs of influenza would be informative. 6. Adverse events with treatment. With regard to drug tolerability, it is important to examine not only the frequencies of reported adverse events but also assess indicators of their severity and interference with compliance (e.g., symptom days, patient reported severity, premature cessation of study drug). Comparisons of AEs in the placebo groups across zanamivir and oseltamivir studies need to be interpreted with caution, since these studies were performed in different influenza seasons viruses and locations, with different protocols and case record forms, and by different investigators. Only one head-head RCT of treatment comparing these drugs has been published to date to my knowledge but the design did not include placebo only groups [Duval 2010 ]. In particular, comparisons in children (page 24) need to be age-adjusted as there were major differences in those enrolled into the zanamivir (5 years and older) and oseltamivir trials (1 year and older), and the frequencies of gastrointestinal manifestations are much higher in younger children with influenza and other acute illnesses. 7. Prophylaxis endpoints of interest. The analysis of prophylaxis outcomes and the associated discussion requires clarification. The statement on page 5 says: \"The FDA has also not allowed an indication for interference of viral transmission within households (the key concept behind post-exposure prophylaxis).\" The key concept behind post-exposure prophylaxis is prevention of illness in exposed persons, and the primary endpoint in most prophylaxis studies has been symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed influenza illness. FDA and other regulatory agencies have approved both NAIs for post-exposure prophylaxis in households and also for longer duration preexposure chemoprophylaxis [reviewed in Khazemi 2009 ]. The Jefferson analysis seems to focus exclusively on the effect of chemoprophylaxis in \"preventing the spread\" of influenza, with endpoints presumably determined by evidence of culture or serologically confirmed infection irrespective of illness. While this is one endpoint of interest in such studies, the primary outcome of medical interest is prevention of influenza illness in those exposed. There is abundant RCT data, as well as observational data from the 2009 pandemic, that both inhaled zanamivir and oral oseltamivir have both statistically significant and medically important effects on preventing influenza-specific illness. Of note, the development of serologic evidence of infection without illness is advantageous in those receiving chemoprophylaxis, as it likely is an immunizing event that protects against future infection and illness by that strain. In addition several oseltamivir RCTs have shown significant but lesser effects on influenza infection in prophylaxis recipients ]. The authors should present all of the relevant endpoints in their analysis of the prophylaxis trials. 8. Adverse effects with prophylaxis. The prophylaxis studies are particularly useful in assessing drug tolerability as symptoms of acute illness present in treatment studies are not confounders and there is a more prolonged duration of drug exposure. However, it is essential to examine not only the frequencies of reported adverse events but also indicators of their severity and possible interference with compliance (e.g., symptom days, patient reported severity, premature cessation of study drug). For example, the Jefferson posting states that \"Similarly, a published prophylaxis trial (Hayden 1999a , known by its trial ID WV15673/ WV15697) describes headache as having \"occurred in similar proportions of subjects in the three groups (39 to 47 per cent).\" but indicates that Japanese regulatory documents reached a different conclusion. My own review of the adverse event tabulations from our 6-weeks prophylaxis study (tables provided by the sponsor) indicates that the proportions of subjects reporting headache (not otherwise specified) that might have been related to study drug (unrelated reports excluded) during the treatment phase were similar across the placebo (N=116, 22.4%), oseltamivir 75 mg once (N=124, 23.8%), and oseltamivir 75 mg twice (N=132, 25.4%) daily dose groups ]. Most of these reports indicated mild or moderate intensity and were self-limited. As indicated in the published paper ], study withdrawals for AEs or illness occurred infrequently across these same groups (N=10, 1.9%; N= 8, 1.5%; N= 7, 1.3%). Of note, the specified causes for AE-related withdrawals included three reports of headache associated with other symptoms in the placebo group. In contrast, there were no reports of headache as reason for the withdrawals receiving oseltamivir; gastrointestinal complaints accounted for withdrawals in 4 of 8 oseltamivir 75 mg and 3 of 7 oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily recipients. The total numbers of patients with premature study withdrawal for any reason was 21 (4.0%), 17 (3.3%), and 16 (3.1%) across the three groups, respectively. Overall, severe AEs were reported in 82 (15.8%) of placebo, 75 (14.4%) of oseltamivir 75 mg, and 77 (14.8%) of oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily recipients. We were unable to include these details in the paper because of space limitations but my interpretation remains that no excess of clinically relevant oseltamivir-related headache occurred during this study. This type of detailed AE analysis incorporating severity measures provides necessary context in interpreting the possible importance of AEs. 9. Peer review. The questions raised and opinions expressed in this and earlier Cochrane reports on NAIs by Jefferson and colleagues have resulted in debate and sometimes confusion among practitioners and policy makers regarding the appropriate use of NAIs in seasonal and pandemic influenza responses. Given the importance of these issues, it would be helpful for any future updates to have proper independent review before posting or publication by the Collaboration, as the Cochrane methodology of publication and then independent peer review is not well understood by many people. Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments. I look forward to seeing the responses from Dr. Jefferson and his colleagues on these points. We use the term 'adverse events' throughout this document rather than harms or adverse reactions as these latter terms imply causality which may or may not be appropriate. In keeping with the methods of our previous review we will not use data from journal publications for this proposed analysis. We now have access to multiple clinical study reports (CSRs) for both oseltamivir and zanamivir. To our knowledge this is the first time some of these data have been available outside manufacturers and regulators, and allows for the exploration of events in more detail than is possible using the limited information on safety reported in journal publications. This potentially allows us to address some of the concerns that have arisen in the post marketing period about the possible relationship between neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir in particular, and neuropsychiatric and other harms. The documents available to us contain listings and summaries of adverse events recorded in the trials including narrative summaries of serious adverse events and adverse events leading to study withdrawal. The adverse events are classified by relationship to the study drug and also, by intensity (mild, moderate, severe, life-threatening and death). The duration of events is reported and they are also lumped into body systems such as gastrointestinal, neurological, etc.\n\nAll CSRs of oseltamivir and zanamivir will be included in our analysis. CSRs for prophylaxis, for treatment of adults and for treatment of children will be analysed separately. Adverse events will be initially descriptively compared over the entire treatment and followup period but then potentially stratified by on-treatment and off-treatment periods if it appears there may be a difference between treatment groups.\n\nFor common events of any intensity with an overall incidence of 2% or more we will compare the incidence between treatment groups. The cut-off of 2% is based on a power analysis where assuming 4000 patients in total (this is approximately how many patients we have access to in oseltamivir treatment trials of adults as well as in oseltamivir prophylaxis trials of adults), we will have 80% power to detect an odds ratio of 1.75 with 5% level of significance.\n\nDue to a lack of data to compare uncommon events we will compare events lumped into body systems between treatment groups. If we find evidence of a difference in incidences between groups lumped into a body system we will conduct further analysis if appropriate. This further analysis is to determine whether the difference in incidence is due to any common events included in that body system. For example, in the case of neurological body system, if we found evidence of a difference between treatment groups we would remove all common neurological events such as headaches and repeat the analysis.\n\nAs well as the analysis described in section 2.2 above we will also conduct a subgroup analysis of just the events with severe intensity, serious events and events leading to study withdrawal. We will use the same definitions of \"severe\" and \"serious\" as specified in the CSRs. However we will check the classifications using all the information available in the CSRs including line listings of events, narratives provided for serious events and also for events leading to study withdrawal. Any disagreements with the original classifications will be recorded and any reclassifications will be assessed in a sensitivity analysis. Given it is unlikely there will be sufficient events to conduct separate statistical analysis at the level of body system we will compare the overall distribution of events by body system between treatment groups.\n\nAs a further check on the validity of the data on adverse events contained in the CSRs we will conduct descriptive comparisons of the incidence of adverse events in the prophylaxis and treatment trials. This is because of the unclear methods of collecting and classifying adverse events in the trials. A potential adverse event could have been classified as a symptom of influenza, an efficacy outcome (such as complication of influenza) or an adverse event. Hence an informal comparison of the incidence of adverse events in the trials where participants had influenza (or influenza-like-illness) and the trials where participants did not have influenza may help show where adverse events could have been under-reported. We will take into account factors such as age of participants and duration of treatment exposure for these informal analyses. In addition if it is clear that an adverse event was not reported as an adverse event but was included elsewhere in the CSR (e.g. in the efficacy section), we will include that data in our adverse event analyses. We will also construct a table showing the definitions specified in each CSR for classifying potential adverse events as adverse events, complications or symptoms of influenza.\n\nWe have already reported that antibody production was lower in the oseltamivir group than in the placebo group in the systematic review of treatment trials of oseltamivir (2012). We will update this analysis by including additional oseltamivir trials as well as assess antibody production in the zanamivir trials. We will assess antibody production in the prophylaxis trials of oseltamivir and zanamivir by the following methods. We will first identify the participants who had influenza-like illness (ILI) or pyrexia. If the proportion is similar between active group and placebo group, the proportion of participants who had four times or higher increase of antibody will be compared between groups.\n\nA number of trials included two or more active treatment arms with different doses of study medication given to participants in each of the arms. For these trials we will investigate the dose-response relationship for common adverse events (as defined above).\n\nInitial analysis will be descriptive only where we will report the numbers and percentages of events by treatment group. If there is a potential difference in the pooled percentages between treatment groups (e.g. if there is more than a two standard error difference between percentages) then we will conduct formal meta-analysis. If indicated we may also conduct additional analyses taking into account event intensity and/or duration.\n\nThe methods presented above are those that we have pre-specified prior to formal analysis of the data. A limitation of these methods is that we may fail to detect differences in rare adverse events because these events will be compared along with other types of events within body systems. Therefore in the process of conducting our formal analysis we may generate further hypotheses or conduct additional exploratory analyses. If this is the case then we will clearly label these analyses as exploratory and interpret the findings accordingly.\n\nFor most people, influenza is a self limiting illness. However the disease can at times lead to serious complications such as pneumonia and hospitalisations, and if treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors can reduce the risk of severe outcomes, this would be an important public health benefit. Another potentially important public health benefit would be the ability of antivirals to interrupt person to person transmission of influenza. Current evidence for these outcomes is scarce or inconclusive. A positive balance of effects on complications and viral spread versus harm profile is the main reason for using NIs in a public health context, especially the orally administered oseltamivir. All analysis will be based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) or safety populations as our prior review discovered compelling evidence that the ITTI (the subpopulation deemed to be influenza-infected) populations were not balanced between treatment groups in the Roche oseltamivir trials. In addition, estimates from the ITT population will be more generalisable to clinical practice where routine testing for influenza is not common in many countries (and even where used, remains of variable accuracy). Analysis will be conducted separately for prophylaxis trials, treatment trials of adults and treatment trials of children. The list of outcomes given below includes all potential outcomes that we believe are clinically important. However a number of them may not be formally comparable in this review because there are insufficient numbers of events (e.g. mortality) or they were not adequately measured or reported (e.g. drug resistance). \n\nSummary https://editorial-unit.cochrane.org/cochrane-review-neuraminidase-inhibitors-influenza\n\nWe have received feedback from Roche and the full document is accessible via the above link, hosted on the Cochrane Editorial Unit's (CEU) website. The review authors submitted their reply to the Roche feedback on 23 March 2015, and this has been posted on the CEU website.\n\nSubmitted by Barry Clinch, 1 James Smith, 2 Andy Kenwright, 1 Bernadette Surujbally, 3 We are members of the Association of Victims of Tamiflu-related Encephalopathy, a group of victims whose children or other family members had serious reactions after taking Tamiflu, including sudden death, accidental death due to abnormal behaviours, and serious sequelae with disability. In this letter, we would like to respectfully request your group to establish the causality between Tamiflu and abnormal behaviours, sudden death or sequelae. We have learnt that the WHO's essential medicines list was amended and Tamiflu was moved from the core to the complementary list, and that its use be restricted to severe illness due to confirmed or suspected influenza virus infection in critically ill hospitalized patients. Moreover, the next Expert Committee might consider Tamiflu for deletion, unless new information supporting the use in seasonal and pandemic outbreaks is provided. We understand that the systematic review your group issued in April 2014 and the opinion you submitted to the WHO have served as the major evidence that promoted the amendment and future possible deletion of Tamiflu from the essential medicines model list. We, all the members of the Association of Victims, deeply appreciate you for conducting such an important systematic review which influenced the policy of WHO. We know the outline of the results of your systematic review because Dr. Rokuro Hama, a Japanese doctor who is one of the members of the Cochrane team translated some important parts of the review into Japanese and uploaded it on his website: http://www.npojip.org/ sokuho/140410.html According to the translation, the results of the systematic review is summarized as follows: 1) Tamiflu reduced the time to first alleviation of symptoms in adults by 0.7 day (from 7 to 6.3 days). There was no effect in asthmatic children who are the real target of efficacy, although healthy children of Tamiflu group alleviate symptoms one day earlier than placebo group. 2) Tamiflu reduced the production of antibody against influenza. 3) Tamiflu did not decrease hospitalization. 4) There was no evidence that Tamiflu reduce influenza like illness. 5) Tamiflu induced harmful effects such as nausea, vomiting, headache, neurologic symptoms, kidney disorders, diabetic/hyperglycemia and pain in extremities. Zanamivir had no such adverse effects. 6) In particular, neuro-psychiatric symptoms were significantly more reported in Tamiflu group than in the placebo group in the prophylaxis trials. Dose-response relationship was also seen in the treatment trials. \"Abnormal behaviour\" has been listed as one of the adverse reactions to Tamiflu in the Japanese label of Tamiflu since 2004. Hence, we believe that the accidental deaths due to abnormal behaviours after using Tamiflu should be recognized as death cases caused by side effects of Tamiflu, and that they should be relieved by the government. We submitted the applications for damage relief to the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), but they rejected them, stating that \"there is no association with Tamiflu use\". We also believe that the sudden deaths during sleep may be the consequences of side effects of Tamiflu because animals died suddenly after the administration of Tamiflu in animal experiments. Therefore, we applied damage relief for the sudden death cases as well, but PMDA rejected them with the same reason. We, 14 families filed cases against PMDA to cancel the decision. Three families (one sudden death and two accidental deaths after abnormal behavior) lost the cases at the Supreme Court. The court accepted the claim of PMDA: the causes of both sudden death and accidental death due to abnormal behaviors were caused by influenza related encephalopathy and not by Tamiflu use because Tamiflu has no effect on brain and there is no evidence suggesting causality in animal, clinical and epidemiologic studies. However, sensory function, cognitive function and consciousness of rats are disturbed and the mortality of rats from sudden death rises as the doses of Tamiflu increases as shown in the review article on the mechanisms of sudden-onset type of reactions to Tamiflu (Hama et al. 2016 ). High dose of Tamiflu stops animals' respiration, followed by cardiac arrest (Kimura and Haji et al. 2013). It induces low body temperature (Ono et al. 2013 ). There are some epidemiologic studies which suggest association between Tamiflu use and delirium or unconsciousness (Fujita et al. 2010 ). There is also an epidemiologic study in which sudden deteriorations leading to death within 12 hours after Tamiflu use were far more frequently reported than after Relenza use ). All these findings suggest close association, but the judges neglected them and concluded that there was \"no causal association\" based solely on the claims of PMDA. We ourselves witnessed extremely abnormal course of dying or developing sequelae in our precious children or other family members. Based on these experiences we are convinced that there is no cause for these events other than Tamiflu. However, we are merely lay people, and we have no scientific means to prove it by ourselves. If your group could establish the causality between Tamiflu and abnormal behaviours, sudden death or sequelae, it would be greatly appreciated. If needed, all the members of our group are willing to provide any information about our family cases. Thank you very much for your understanding and kind assistance in advance. Yours sincerely, All members of the Association of Victims of Tamiflu-related Encephalopathy I do not have any affiliation with or involvement in any organisation with a financial interest in the subject matter of my comment Ms. Ryuko Hatano Affiliation: The Association of Victims of Tamiflu -related Encephalopathy Role: Representative\n\nDear Ms Hatano, Thank you for your query. We sympathize with your position. However, unfortunately we do not have enough information to respond to your specific request to \"establish the causality between Tamiflu and abnormal behaviours, sudden death or sequelae.\" The following explains why we cannot address your specific requests, and offers some thoughts on possibly relevant information that we can speak to based on our Cochrane Review. Our systematic Review published in 2014 did not conduct a statistical test on every type of adverse event that was recorded in the clinical trials that we studied. Doing so may have led to false positives and false negative as well, undermining the reliability of any associations that we might have otherwise been able to detect. Therefore, as we write in the Review, our approach was to meta-analyze \"(1) all serious adverse events; (2) all adverse events leading to study withdrawal; (3) all withdrawals; (4) all adverse events within a clinical study report's defined body system; as well as (5) a small group of common adverse events as defined in the FDA drug label for oseltamivir.\" (p.7). Importantly, \"There were too few events to meta-analyse (1) deaths; (2) serious adverse events by body system; and (3) any events that had an overall incidence of less than 0.5%. We did not meta-analyse outcomes with fewer than 10 events in total\" (p.7). \"Abnormal behaviours\", \"sudden death\" or \"sequelae\" per se did not have an overall incidence of greater than 0.5%, and therefore we did not conduct statistical tests on them.\n\nOur Review however, did conduct statistical tests and make causal inferences regarding other adverse events that may be possibly relevant to your concerns.\n\nProf Del Mar was a Board member of two companies to commercialise research at Bond University, part of his responsibilities as Pro-Vice Chancellor (Research) until 2010, receives fees for editorial and guideline developmental work and royalties from books, and is in receipt of institutional grants from NHMRC (Aus), NIHR (UK) and HTA (UK) and from a private donor (for support of the editorial base of the Cochrane ARI Group).

The review has been prepared with support from a NIHR (UK) grant 10/80/01\n\nWe have made a number of changes to the text of A159 during the process of turning the protocol into the review. This reflects our evolving understanding of the issues, during the relatively long period when work on the review was underway.\n\nWe have changed the review title to reflect the nature of the evidence. The old title was: Neuraminidase inhibitors for preventing and treating influenza in healthy adults and children -a review of clinical study reports.\n\nWe have also re-written the objective twice, tightening up the text to bring it in line with our initial intentions and clarifying its meaning. The old objectives were: \"To review clinical study reports (CSRs) identified from published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and relevant regulatory data on effectiveness and harms of NIs for influenza in all age groups\" and \"To review published and unpublished clinical study reports and other relevant regulatory data on effectiveness and harms of NIs for influenza in all age groups (and compare them with our published review).\"\n\nWe changed the emphasis of the objectives on unpublished study reports as we had decided from the start to concentrate on regulatory information. Similarly, comparison of published versus unpublished data is an important and worthwhile effort, but the original objective possibly misled readers as to its importance in our work. We had always conceptualised it as a low-priority task we could carry out only if we had time following our review of unpublished data. We have also avoided using acronyms, which we thought cumbersome and confusing to the reader.\n\nOur initial intention was to review clinical study reports and regulatory comments making up what we have subsequently called 'regulatory information'. The edits do not reflect a change in intent but our slowly evolving understanding of the problems we faced and our solutions to address these problems. As one of many examples, the transition from a world in which studies were identified by names and years (Nicholson 2000) , to one in which the same trial is identified by a series of letters and numbers (WV15670), was not easy.\n\nWhile the review was underway, we identified several unforeseen issues, such as placebo content and the effect of oseltamivir on antibodies. To test the relevant hypotheses we carried out post-protocol analyses, which had not been present in the original protocol but were derived from our protocol-stated intention to assess programmes and not single trials. These are now reported in their entirety in Appendix 10.\n\nIn May 2013, we added amendments to the review for: data analyses from oseltamivir trials Module 2s, clinical outcomes and adverse events added in the Feedback section. In the text we explain the rationale and methods applying to regulatory information received after our 2011 time lock, which could not be implemented in time for the current review (see also Appendix 2) . For the 16 May 2013 amendments see Feedback.\n\nSince the January 2012 version of A159, we have now completed the review of regulatory information which became available after our original time lock. We have assessed additional evidence from oseltamivir Module 2s, evidence on adverse events following exposure to NIs and clinically relevant outcomes, and cross-referenced this with individual listings contained in Modules 3 to 5. We now hold all the relevant full clinical study reports, which we are making publicly accessible with this review."}
