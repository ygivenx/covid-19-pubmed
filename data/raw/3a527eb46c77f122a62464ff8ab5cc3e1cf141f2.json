{"title": "Seoul virus enhances regulatory and reduces proinflammatory responses in male Norway rats", "body": "Zoonotic pathogens are maintained in the environment in their natural reservoir hosts, often causing persistent infection in the absence of disease. In such highly coevolved systems, virulence and host antiviral responses have evolved to ensure survival of both the host and the pathogen [Hudson et al., 2002] . Several zoonotic viruses are persistently maintained in their natural reservoirs without causing disease, including Lassa virus in multimammate rats (Mastomys natalensis), SARS-CoV in horseshoe bat species (Rhinolophus spp.), Nipah virus in flying foxes (Pteropus spp.), Macupho virus in large vesper mice (Calomys callosus), Sin Nombre virus in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), and Seoul virus (SEOV) in Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) [Botten et al., 2003; Calisher et al., 2006; Childs et al., 1989; Johnson et al., 1965; Walker et al., 1975; Wang et al., 2006] . Spillover of these viruses to incidental human hosts often results in host-mediated disease, including Lassa fever, SARS, Nipah virus-associated disease, Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), respectively. Clinical symptoms in humans generally are caused by excessively elevated proinflammatory responses, often termed a \"cytokine storm\" [Huang et al., 2005; Khaiboullina and St Jeor, 2002; Mori et al., 1999; Villinger et al., 1999] .\n\nWhether virus persistence in the absence of clinical disease in natural reservoir hosts is caused by suppressed proinflammatory responses during viral infection has not been characterized because of a lack of available reagents for exotic host species. A notable exception is the persistence of an arenavirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), in mice (Mus musculus), which is mediated by suppression of CD8+ T cell and proinflammatory responses [Hahm et al., 2005; Moskophidis et al., 1993] . Suppression of proinflammatory and cytotoxic T cell responses can be caused by the activity of regulatory T cells, including production of TGF-\u03b2, and recent studies demonstrate that these cells contribute to persistence of hantaviruses in their rodent hosts Schountz et al., 2007] . During SEOV infection, expression of Foxp3 and production of TGF-\u03b2 is elevated during the persistent phase of infection at a site of elevated virus replication (i.e. lungs). Inactivation of regulatory T cells reduces persistence of SEOV in the lungs and the duration of shedding in rats . Whether host regulatory responses indirectly mediate hantavirus persistence through suppression of proinflammatory responses has not been examined and was one goal of the present study.\n\nThe kinetics of proinflammatory, anti-inflammatory, and regulatory responses during the acute and persistent phases of SEOV infection in Norway rats were evaluated. In the lungs (i.e. a site of elevated SEOV replication), proinflammatory responses generally were reduced, whereas regulatory responses were elevated throughout infection. In the spleen (i.e. a site of low SEOV replication and high immunological activity), proinflammatory responses were elevated and regulatory responses were not induced during infection. To establish whether reduced proinflammatory responses mediate SEOV persistence in rats, exogenous IL-1\u03b2 was administered at physiological levels throughout infection. Moderate elevation of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1, did not reduce SEOV persistence, as initially hypothesized. Thus, these data illustrate that the balance between proinflammatory responses clearing virus and causing immunopathology may be tightly regulated in highly co-evolved host-pathogen systems.\n\nAdult male (60-70 days of age) Long Evans rats (Rattus norvegicus) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Raleigh, NC) and housed individually in polypropylene cages covered with polyester filter bonnets. All infected males were housed in a pathogen-free Biosafety Level (BSL) 3 animal facility with food and water available ad libitum. Animals were maintained on a constant 14:10 light:dark cycle with lights on at 0600 hours Eastern Standard Time. The Johns Hopkins Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol No. RA04H338) and the Johns Hopkins Office of Health, Safety and Environment (Registration No. P9902030107) approved all procedures described in this manuscript.\n\nOne day prior to inoculation with SEOV, male rats were anaesthetized with isofluorane (Abbot Animal Health, North Chicago, IL) and CO 2 and implanted s.c. with an osmotic minipump (Alzet, Cupertino, CA) that administered 1 \u03bcg of recombinant rat (r)IL-1\u03b2 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in 0.9% saline (n = 10) or vehicle alone (n = 10) over a 24 h period for 30 days. Pumps were removed and new pumps containing either rIL-1\u03b2 or saline were replaced s.c. after 15 days to ensure stability of the rIL-1\u03b2.\n\nMale rats (n = 8-12/time-point/study) were inoculated i.p. with 10 4 plaque forming units (pfu) of purified SEOV (strain SR-11) suspended in 0.2 ml Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (MEM) (with Earle's salts; Mediatech Cellgro, Herndon, VA) or vehicle alone, as described previously [Klein et al., 2001] . At Days 0, 3, 15, 30, and 60 post inoculation (p.i.), animals were anesthetized with isoflourane, blood was obtained from the retro-orbital sinus, and saliva was collected following an i.p. injection of 2.5 mg/kg of pilocarpine HCl (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Rats were euthanized with CO 2 and lung and spleen samples were collected and stored at -80\u00b0C until processed. Day 3 post-inoculation (p.i.) was selected to examine responses during the early acute phase of SEOV infection and samples collected 15 days p.i. were used to evaluate immune responses during the late acute phase of SEOV infection. Days 30 and 60 p.i. were selected to measure responses at different times during the persistent phase of infection. Rats assigned to 'Day 0 p.i.' were not infected, but were processed at different time-points during the study to control for potential effects of age.\n\nMicrotiter plates were coated overnight at 4\u00b0C with SEOV infected or uninfected gammairradiated Vero E6 cells diluted 1:500 in carbonate buffer. Plasma samples and positive and negative control samples were diluted 1:100 in PBS-Tween 20 (PBS-T) with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and added in duplicate to antigen-coated wells. The plates were washed and secondary antibody (alkaline-phosphatase conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (H + L), Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD), diluted 1:400 in PBS with 2% FBS, was added. Substrate buffer (0.5 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) diluted in diethanolamine buffer) was used to develop the reaction and the optical density (OD) was measured at 405 nm. To determine the average adjusted OD, the average OD for each set of uninfected Vero E6 duplicates was subtracted from the average OD for each set of infected Vero E6 duplicates. Samples were considered positive if the average adjusted OD was greater than 0.100 [Klein et al., 2001; Klein et al., 2004a] . To minimize intra-and inter-plate variability, the average adjusted OD was expressed as a percentage of the positive control OD run on each microtiter plate (anti-SEOV IgG, % of PC) for statistical analysis.\n\nRNA was isolated from lung, spleen, and saliva using Trizol LS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and the manufacturer's protocol as described previously [Klein et al., 2001; Klein et al., 2004a] . Following isopropanol precipitation and washing in 75% ethanol, RNA pellets were briefly air dried and resuspended in DEPC-treated water.\n\nFirst-strand synthesis of the S segment of SEOV cDNA was prepared as detailed elsewhere [Hannah et al., 2008 ] using a 0.1 \u03bcM gene-specific primer and the Invitrogen Superscript III First Strand Synthesis reagents. The positive control was SEOV RNA isolated from our virus stock (strain SR-11) and the negative control was DEPC-treated water included in the cDNA syntheses and amplification. Negative-strand genomic SEOV RNA was amplified in a reaction mixture containing Platinum Quantitative PCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen), Rox reference dye, 4.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1 \u03bcM primers, and 0.2 \u03bcM probe (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). All reactions were run in optical 96-well plates using the ABI 7300 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). A standard curve ranging from 10 6 to 10 copies of negative sense SR-11 S segment in plasmid pWRG7077 was run on each plate.\n\nFirst strand cDNA was prepared using 1 \u03bcg of RNA isolated from lung or spleen tissue, 2.5 \u03bcM oligo(dT) 20 primer, and the manufacturer's protocol for Superscript III First Strand Synthesis (Invitrogen). Custom primer and probe sets were generated for Gapdh, Il1\u03b2, Il6, Tnf\u03b1, Ifn\u03b3, Nos2, Ccl2, Ccl5, Cx3cl1, Cxcl10, Vegf, Vcam, Tgf\u03b2, Il10, Il1ra , and Foxp3 using Primer Express 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems). Complementary DNA (1 \u03bcl) was amplified in duplicate in a reaction mixture containing TaqMan Universal Master Mix, 900 nM of each primer, and 250 nM probe, using the manufacturer's protocol (Applied Biosystems). All reactions were run in 96 well optical reaction plates using the ABI 7300 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Serial dilutions of control cDNA from selected rats were used to generate a standard curve, ranging from 2.5 ng/\u03bcl to 25 pg/\u03bcl cDNA, which was run on each plate. Gene expression patterns from SEOV infected animals were normalized to Gapdh expression and are presented as relative to the expression levels from uninfected rats (i.e. Day 0 p.i.) and expressed as fold change.\n\nLung and spleen tissues were homogenized in 1 ml lysis buffer, containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 0.5 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P40, 0.01 mM PMSF, and 0.1% protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma), and centrifuged at 15000 g for 10 min. Cytokine protein in the supernatant was measured using ELISA kits for rat TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-10, and active mouse TGF-\u03b21 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Protein concentrations were normalized to mg total protein as determined using a BCA assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and are expressed as fold change relative to protein concentrations in uninfected rats (i.e. Day 0 p.i.).\n\nProtein from lung and spleen tissue was extracted as described above. Because ELISA reagents are not available for rat CCL5, protein was measured by western blot. Protein (50 \u03bcg) bands were separated onto 4%-12% polyacrylamide-sodium dodecyl sulfate gels and transferred to nitrocellulose by standard procedures. Membranes were blocked for 2 h in TBS with 0.5% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and 5% nonfat dry milk. Monoclonal antibody against CCL5 (1:5000; AbCam, Cambridge, MA) was added and membranes were incubated with shaking at 4\u00b0C for 16 h. Membranes were washed in TBS-T and incubated for 1 h with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:3000; AbCam). Membranes were washed in TBS-T and incubated for 2 h with mouse monoclonal \u03b2-actin conjugated to HRP (1:5000; Abcam) and detected with 3-aminophthathic hydrazide and 4-iodophenylboronic acid [Haan and Behrmann, 2007] .\n\nUninflated lungs were fixed in 10% neutral, buffered formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, cut into 5 \u03bcm sections, and mounted on glass slides. Formaldehyde-induced autofluorescence was photobleached with a 40 W cool white 800 fluorescent lamp at a distance of 6 in for 24 h [Neumann and Gabel, 2002] . Sections were deparaffinized with xylene, rehydrated in graded ethanol, and post-fixed with Streck's Tissue Fixative (STF Streck, Omaha, NE). Antigen retrieval was maximized using Antigen Unmasking Solution (1:100; Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) or proteinase K incubation (20 \u03bcg/ml; Sigma). Tissue sections were blocked with 10% normal horse serum, followed by blocking with avidin D and biotin to block all endogenous biotin, biotin receptors, and avidin binding sites. Slides were incubated in a humidified chamber with a mouse monoclonal antibody against the SEOV nucleocapsid protein (NP; 1:250; EC01-AB08, gift of Connie Schmaljohn, Fort Detrick, MD), mouse anti-rat CD68 mAb for macrophages (1:250, Serotec, Raleigh, NC), or rabbit anti-human von Willebrand factor mAb for endothelial cells (1:500; DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA). Sections were incubated with biotinylated, rat-adsorbed, anti-mouse IgG (5 \u03bcg/ml; Vector Labs) or rabbit multilinker (Biogenex, San Ramon, CA). The signal was revealed using streptavidin conjugated Fluorescein or Texas Red (15 \u03bcg/ml or 10 \u03bcg/ml, respectively; Vector Labs). Double staining was performed sequentially. Apoptosis was identified using a TUNEL staining kit (Roche, Nutley, NJ). Tissues were counterstained with 4',6 diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Labs) and stored in the dark at 4\u00b0C until viewed. Fluorescence emission images were acquired and merged using a SPOT chargecoupled device camera and software (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI) at a magnification of 100x.\n\nFollowing 24 h fixation in 10% formaldehyde, inflated lung and spleen samples were embedded in paraffin, cut into 5 \u03bcm sections, and mounted on glass slides. The slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to examine pathologic observations, including hemorrhage and edema, using light microscopy.\n\nCopies of SEOV RNA, antibody responses, gene expression, protein concentrations, pathological quantitation, and percentages of cells undergoing apoptosis were assessed by ANOVA with one between group variable (day post-inoculation). In cases where the data violated the assumptions of normality, the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used. Significant interactions were further analyzed using the Tukey or Dunn method for pairwise multiple comparisons. Mean differences were considered statistically significant if P < 0.05.\n\nMale rats have more copies of SEOV RNA in their lungs and shed more virus in saliva than females during infection [Hannah et al., 2008; Klein et al., 2001] , suggesting that hantavirus persistence is elevated in males. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the mechanisms mediating viral persistence; therefore, only male rats were used. Anti-SEOV IgG responses increased significantly over the course of infection and were highest 60 days p.i. (Kruskal Wallis: H 4 = 43.9, P < 0.001; Figure 1A ). Copies of SEOV RNA were significantly higher in the lungs than spleen 15-60 days p.i. (Figure 1B ; Kruskal-Wallis: H 7 = 42.9, P < 0.001). In lung tissue, viral RNA was detected at all time-points postinoculation, with viral copies being signficantly elevated 15 and 30 days p.i. as compared with values obtained 3 and 60 days p.i. (H 3 = 12.7, P = 0.005; Figure 1B ). SEOV RNA remained highly detectable through Day 60 p.i. (15,872 \u00b1 9810 copies/g lung tissue) in the lungs of male rats, which is consistent with reports of lifelong viral persistence for other hantavirus infections in rodent reservoirs [Botten et al., 2003; Lee et al., 1981; Yanagihara et al., 1985] .\n\nIHC was used to identify which cells in the lungs were infected with SEOV. Previous studies demonstrating hantavirus antigen in endothelial cells and macrophages have been solely based on morphological analysis or non-specific cell separation [Botten et al., 2003; Lee et al., 1986; Nagai et al., 1985] . In the present study, SEOV nucleocapsid (N) protein was definitively identified in alveolar macrophages, using CD68 (ED1) as a macrophage specific marker, and in endothelial cells, using von Willebrand factor as an endothelial cell marker, in the lungs of male rats during persistent infection (i.e. Day 30 p.i.; Figure 1C ).\n\nProinflammatory cytokine gene expression was measured in the lungs, as a site of elevated SEOV replication, and in the spleen, as a representative secondary lymphoid organ that does not support substantial viral RNA load. In the lungs, the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including Il1\u03b2, Tnf\u03b1, and Il6, generally was reduced during SEOV infection as compared with expression in lungs of uninfected males ( \n\nChemokines are critical mediators of inflammation as they recruit phagocytes and lymphocytes to sites of viral infection. In the lungs, the expression of Cxcl10 and Cx3cl1 was reduced (Cxcl10: Kruskal Wallis: H 4 = 13.3, P = 0.01; Cx3cl1: ANOVA: F 4,58 = 5.09, P = 0.001) and the expression of Ccl2 was not affected by SEOV infection ( Figure 3A) . Conversely, in the spleen, the expression of chemokines, including Ccl2 and Cxcl10, was elevated Days 15 and 30 p.i. (Ccl2: ANOVA: F 4,58 = 6.20, P<0.001; Cxcl10: ANOVA: F 4,58 = 3.09, P = 0.023) and the expression of Cx3cl1 remained unchanged during infection ( Figure 3B ). The expression of Ccl5 was elevated in both the lungs ( Figure 3A ; ANOVA: F 4,58 = 5.09, P = 0.002) and spleen ( Figure 3B ; ANOVA: F 4,58 = 6.78, P<0.001), but protein concentrations in the lungs remained unchanged during infection and were below limits of detection in the spleen ( Figure 3C and data not shown). Whether discordance of CCL5 gene expression and protein production is indicative of specific post-transcriptional regulation remains to be determined.\n\nRegulatory T cells can suppress proinflammatory responses and contribute to SEOV pesistence [Belkaid and Rouse, 2005; . Both TGF-\u03b2 gene expression and protein concentrations were elevated in the lungs during the persistent phase of SEOV infection (i.e. Days 30 and 60 p.i.) when compared to baseline concentrations in uninfected males ( Figure 4A and C; mRNA: Kruskal Wallis: H 4 = 17.0, P = 0.002; protein: ANOVA: F 4,49 = 3.95, P = 0.009). The expression of the regulatory T cell transcription factor, Foxp3, also was elevated in the lungs of male rats during persistent infection ( Figure 4A ; ANOVA: F 4,49 =5.03, P = 0.002). In the spleen, regulatory responses, including expression and production of TGF-\u03b2 and Foxp3, were not altered by SEOV infection (Figure 4B and D) .\n\nIn addition to TGF-\u03b2, transcription of proinflammatory factors can be regulated by other anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10 and IL-1ra. Interleukin-10 is produced by a range of cell types, including lymphocytes and macrophages, and serves as a general antiinflammatory cytokine; whereas, IL-1ra, also produced by several cell types, specifically inhibits IL-1\u03b2 activity by binding to the IL-1 receptor [Janeway C.A., 2001] . Interleukin-10 gene expression and protein production were reduced in the lungs throughout SEOV infection (Figures 4C and E Expression of Il-1ra mRNA, however, did not increase above expression levels in uninfected males in either the lungs or spleen of male rats throughout SEOV infection ( Figure 4E and F).\n\nDuring the classical acute phase response, IL-1\u03b2 production is elevated and causes downstream induction of other proinflammatory responses, including TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 [Granowitz et al., 1992; Ikejima et al., 1990] . In humans, concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines are elevated during acute hantavirus infection and if survival is the final outcome, then virus is cleared [Krakauer et al., 1995; Mori et al., 1999] . Proinflammatory responses are consistently reduced or remain unchanged in male rats at sites of elevated virus replication, throughout SEOV infection. Whether the lack of induction of proinflammatory responses directly influences the ability of SEOV to persist in its host in the absence of clinical pathology was evaluated by administering rIL-1\u03b2 or vehicle during the course of infection at a dose (1 \u03bcg/day, s.c.) reported to elevate circulating IL-1\u03b2 without causing manifestations of sickness [Busbridge et al., 1993] . Because we were interested in the role of proinflammatory cytokines in mediating SEOV persistence, the effects of exogenous IL-1\u03b2 were measured at a time-point during persistent infection when viral replication was high (i.e. Day 30 p.i.). Administration of rIL-1\u03b2 significantly elevated circulating concentrations of IL-1\u03b2, as well as expression of Il6 and Tnf\u03b1 in the lungs, as compared with uninfected rats that were administered vehicle alone ( Figure 5 ; IL-1\u03b2: T = 17.5, P = 0.032; Il6: t = -2.13, df = 7, P = 0.071; Tnf\u03b1: t = -2.52, df = 7, P = 0.04). Administration of exogenous IL-1\u03b2 did not, however, affect the amount of SEOV RNA in the lungs and saliva nor did it affect the proportion of rats shedding virus in saliva ( Figure 6A and B) .\n\nSEOV infection in rats causes subclinical, acute, and focal hemorrhage and edema in the lungs . Similar foci of hemorrhage and edema were observed in the lungs of male rats 30 days after inoculation with SEOV and treatment with rIL-1\u03b2 had no effect on the amount of pathological observations ( Figure 6C ). Although proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6, may contribute to clinical disease during human hantavirus infection, proinflammatory infiltration was not observed in the lungs of infected rats, whether treated with exogenous rIL-1\u03b2 or vehicle. Pathology was not observed in the lungs of uninfected male rats, regardless of rIL-1\u03b2 treatment ( Figure 6C ). Additionally, pathological lesions were not observed in the spleen (data not shown).\n\nThe mechansims mediating hemorrhage and edema are not known. Hantaviruses generally do not cause apoptosis in human cell lines (i.e. HUVEC) or cells in tissues from patients who died from hantavirus infection [Khaiboullina et al., 2004; Mori et al., 1999] . Hantaviruses do not appear to cause cytopathic effects in their rodent hosts, but whether apoptosis occurs has not been determined [Botten et al., 2000; Yanagihara et al., 1985] . Similar percentages of apoptotic cells were observed in the lungs of uninfected male rats and males infected with SEOV for 30 days; exogenous administration of rIL-1\u03b2 had no effect on the number of cells undergoing apoptosis ( Figure 6D ). Taken together, these data suggest that hemorrhage and edema in the lungs that is caused by SEOV infection is not affected by the modest elevation of concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines achieved by administration of rIL-1\u03b2 or apoptosis.\n\nSEOV disseminates to several tissues in rats, but the lungs are a primary site of elevated virus replication [Hinson et al., 2004; Klein et al., 2004b] . Consistent with previously reported tissue tropism, copies of SEOV RNA were higher in the lungs than spleen and virus persisted for at least 60 days p.i. Hantaviruses maintain lifelong infections in their rodent reservoirs; thus, SEOV RNA likely remains detectable well after 60 days p.i. [Botten et al., 2003; Lee et al., 1981; Yanagihara et al., 1985] . Elevated viral load in the lungs was correlated with reduced proinflammatory and elevated regulatory responses during persistent infection. Conversely, in the spleen, where SEOV RNA was low, proinflammatory responses were elevated and regulatory responses were not induced during either acute or persistent phases of SEOV infection.\n\nHumans are incidental hosts that develop acute disease during infection and do not maintain persistent infection. Excessive proinflammatory responses in humans are correlated with the development of clinical symptoms and death during hantavirus infection. Proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6, are elevated in circulation and in tissues during symptomatic or fatal hantavirus infection in humans [Mori et al., 1999; Temonen et al., 1996] . Production of chemokines, including CCL5 and CXCL10, is induced following exposure of human endothelial cells to hantaviruses and likely contributes to the infiltration of lymphocytes to the site of infection [Sundstrom et al., 2001] . When symptoms of hantavirus infection are most severe in humans, nitric oxide responses are elevated, which is indicative of an activated macrophage response [Davis et al., 2002; Groeneveld et al., 1995] . Following the innate response to hantavirus infection, hantavirus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are recruited to infected tissues and overall activity of CD8+ T cells (e.g. production of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1) is elevated during symptomatic hantavirus infection in humans and contributes to the manifestations of disease and mortality [Ennis et al., 1997; Kilpatrick et al., 2004; Klingstrom et al., 2006; Terajima et al., 2007] .\n\nIn contrast to humans, the expression and production of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6, was reduced in the lungs of male rats infected with SEOV. The absence or suppression of chemokine stimulation in the lungs of male rats may contribute to reduced lymphocyte infiltration to sites of viral replication, which may prevent proinflammatory-mediated pathology and contribute to viral persistence. Reduced expression of Nos2 in the lungs of infected male rats suggests that macrophage activity may be reduced during SEOV infection [Lyons et al., 1992] . By contrast, proinflammatory responses, including production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, were elevated in the spleen. Male rats that are infected with SEOV do not appear to be globally immunosuppressed, but rather have a site-specific reduction of proinflammatory responses. There is no evidence that male rats that are naturally infected with SEOV are more likely to acquire additional pathogens, further demonstrating that infected rats are not immunocompromised during hantavirus infection . Responses mounted in the spleen may represent an attempt by the rodent host to control viral replication, but do not appear to eliminate viral RNA in other organs.\n\nMechanisms mediating localized suppression of proinflammatory responses in the lungs of male rats during SEOV infection are not known, but may be mediated by host regulatory responses. Regulatory T cells (CD4+CD25+FoxP3+) contribute to the persistence of several pathogens, including hantaviruses, by suppressing host proinflammatory and effector T cell responses locally at the site of infection [Belkaid and Rouse, 2005; Schountz et al., 2007] . Consistent with previous data, the expression of Foxp3 and the production of TGF-\u03b2 were elevated in the lungs, but not in the spleen, during persistent SEOV infection in male rats . The effects of regulatory T cells on virus persistence likely are mediated by TGF-\u03b2, and not IL-10, as IL-10 transcription and synthesis consistently was suppressed in both the lungs and spleen throughout infection. Functional inactivation of regulatory T cells eliminates the suppression of proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs during the persistent phase of SEOV infection in male rats , but whether regulatory T cells suppress proinflammatory or CD8+ T cell responses to mediate hantavirus persistence in rodents has not been determined.\n\nTo test the hypothesis that suppression of proinflammatory responses during infection may be a critical component of hantavirus persistence in rodents, IL-1\u03b2 was manipulated in vivo. Male rats were administered doses of rIL-1\u03b2 that elevated circulating IL-1\u03b2 and expression of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in their lungs, but that did not cause pathology, as is observed in humans during acute hantavirus infection [Khaiboullina and St Jeor, 2002; Krakauer et al., 1995; Mori et al., 1999] . Treatment of male rats with physiological doses of rIL-1\u03b2 had no effect on the amount of SEOV RNA present in the lungs or shed in saliva. From these data, we conclude that suppression of proinflammatory cytokines below baseline concentrations may not be the critical factor in mediating SEOV persistence, as elevation of proinflammatory cytokines within physiological ranges is not sufficient to affect persistence of SEOV in rats. Supra-physiological concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines may be necessary for viral clearance, but at the cost of causing immunopathology and disease. An alternative hypothesis is that enhanced regulatory T cell activity in the lungs may reduce local CD8+ T cell responses to cause SEOV persistence. Several viruses, including LCMV and HCV suppress CD8+ T cell activity to establish and maintain persistent infection [Moskophidis et al., 1993; Neumann-Haefelin et al., 2007] and although a non-natural host, in newborn mice, Hantaan virus persistence is correlated with reduced IFN\u03b3-producing CD8+ T cells [Araki et al., 2004] . Whether SEOV-specific CD8+ T cell activity (e.g. production of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1) is altered by infection requires further investigation.\n\nHantaviral persistence may be mediated not only by alterations in rodent host immune responses, but also directly by the virus. Segment reassortment has been observed in several natural rodent hosts that are infected with multiple strains of a single hantavirus species [Feuer et al., 1999] . Development of quasispecies during the course of infection with a single strain of hantavirus also is suggestive of potential virus-mediated mechanisms of immune evasion [Chu et al., 2006] . Additionally, cyclical accumulation of deletions and insertions in areas of the SEOV genome necessary for the initiation of transcription has been observed in infected VeroE6 cells and presents another alternative mechanism of virusmediated persistence . Hantavirus persistence in rodents is likely mediated by both the virus and host response to infection.\n\nZoonotic viruses, including hantaviruses, have cospeciated with their natural reservoir hosts and have calibrated their virulence to support virus persistence without causing notable disease. Strategies of hantaviral persistence in their rodent reservoirs may include not only alteration of host behavior to increase behavioral transmission (i.e. increased aggression), but also modulation of host immunity to establish and maintain persistent infection [Hannah et al., 2008; Klein et al., 2004a; . Future studies must continue to determine whether hantaviral persistence, mediated by regulatory T cells in the lungs, is due to suppression of excessively high proinflammatory or CD8+ T cell responses at a site of elevated virus replication that may otherwise be necessary for viral clearance. Immune responses against zoonotic pathogens in other mammalian reservoirs should be evaluated to better understand the evolution of pathogens and their reservoir hosts as well as the mechanisms contributing to maintenance of these pathogens in the environment.\n\nMale rats were inoculated with SEOV and virus-specific IgG was measured by ELISA and viral RNA was assessed by real-time RT-PCR. Anti-SEOV IgG was detectable by Day 15 p.i. and increased over time, as indicated (*), P<0.05 (A). SEOV RNA peaked 15 and 30 days p.i. in the lungs (*) and from Days 15 -60 p.i., the amount of virus was higher in the lungs than spleen, P<0.05 (B). Using immunohistochemistry, SEOV N protein (green) was identified in macrophages with anti-ED1 mAb (C top; red) and endothelial cells with antivon Willebrand's factor mAb (C bottom; red).\n\nExpression of Il1\u03b2, Il6, and Tnf\u03b1 in the lungs (A) and spleen (B) was measured at Days 0, 3, 15, 30, and 60 p.i. by real-time RT-PCR and is expressed as relative to tissue-specific concentrations in uninfected male rats (dotted line). For all dependent measures, samples were collected from uninfected rats at the same time as infected rats and are designated 'Day 0 p.i.'. Expression of each cytokine was normalized to the expression of the endogenous control, Gapdh, for each sample. Protein concentrations of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 were measured in the lungs (C) and spleen (D) by ELISA and are expressed as relative to protein Expression of Foxp3 and Tgf\u03b2 in the lungs (A) and spleen (B) at Days 0, 3, 15, 30, and 60 p.i. was measured by real-time RT-PCR, expressed as relative to expression in uninfected males (dotted line), and normalized to the expression Gapdh for each sample. Tissue samples were collected from uninfected rats at the same time as infected rats and are designated 'Day 0 p.i.'. Protein concentrations of active TGF-\u03b21 and IL-10 were measured in the lungs (C) and spleen (D) by ELISA and are expressed as relative to protein production in uninfected males. The expression of Il10 and Il1ra was measured in the lungs (E) and spleen (F) of male rats during the acute and persistent phases of SEOV infection.\n\nFollowing administration of exogenous rat IL-1\u03b2 (1 \u03bcg/day) or vehicle for 30 days in SEOVinfected and uninfected male rats, IL-1\u03b2 protein was measured in serum by ELISA and Il6 and Tnf\u03b1 expression in the lungs was measured by real-time RT-PCR. Protein concentrations and gene expression (normalized to Gapdh expression) in infected rats are represented as fold change from baseline (i.e. concentrations in uninfected vehicle-treated male rats).\n\nExogenous rat IL-1\u03b2 (1 \u03bcg/day) or vehicle was administered to male rats and SEOV RNA was measured in the lungs (A) and saliva (B) 30 days after inoculation. The proportion of rats shedding SEOV in saliva is represented above the appropriate bar. Lung tissues from male rats that received rIL-1\u03b2 or vehicle for 30 days also were prepared for pathologic examination using H&E staining (C). Lungs were collected from uninfected rats at the same time as infected rats. The top panels are representative lung sections from vehicle-treated rats and the bottom panels are lungs sections from rats treated with exogenous rIL-1\u03b2 for 30 days, but that either remained uninfected or were infected with SEOV (10X magnification). Representative foci of hemorrhage and edema in the lungs of male rats that were infected with SEOV are illustrated in both of the right panels. Apoptosis was identified in lung tissue from uninfected male rats and from males infected with SEOV for 30 days using an TUNEL staining kit for IHC (D). Percentages of cells in the lungs of infected and uninfected rats that received rIL-1\u03b2 or vehicle for 30 days and that were positive for apoptosis (TUNEL+) were measured in regions with (Pathology+) and without (Pathology-) subclinical hemorrhage and edema."}
