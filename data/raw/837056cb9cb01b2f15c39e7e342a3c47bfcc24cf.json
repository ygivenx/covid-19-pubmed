The rest parts of virus genome encode accessory proteins and four essential 51 structural proteins, including spike (S) glycoprotein, small envelope (E) protein, matrix (M) 52 protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein 1, 2 . Current antiviral drugs developed to treat coronavirus 53 (CoV) infections primarily target S protein, the 3C-like (3CL) and papain-like (PLP) proteases 3, 4 . 54\n\nBecause mutant viruses in the S protein is prone to escape the targeted therapeutic with 55 different host-cell receptor binding patterns 4 , as well as antibody-dependent enhancement 56 (ADE) effects of S protein antibodies are found in MERS coronavirus 5 , there are several limitations 57 on targeting S protein for antiviral approaches.

It plays many pivotal roles in forming helical ribonucleoproteins 63 during packaging the RNA genome, regulating viral RNA synthesis during replication, 64 transcription and modulating infected cell metabolism [6] [7] [8] . The primary functions of N protein are 65 binding to the viral RNA genome, and packing them into a long helical nucleocapsid structure 66 or ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex 9,10 . In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that N protein 67 bound to leader RNA, and was critical for maintaining highly ordered RNA conformation suitable 68 for replicating, and transcribing the viral genome 7,11 . More studies implicated that N protein 69 regulated host-pathogen interactions, such as actin reorganization, host cell cycle progression, 70 and apoptosis [12] [13] [14] . The N protein is also a highly immunogenic and abundantly expressed protein 71 during infection, capable of inducing protective immune responses against SARS-CoV and 72 At present work, we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid N-terminal 87 domain (termed as SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD), as a model for understanding the molecular 88 interactions that govern SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD binding to ribonucleotides. Compared with other 89 solved CoVs N-NTD, we characterized the specificity surface electrostatic potential features of 90 SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD. Additionally, we further demonstrated the unique RNA binding site 91 characteristics. Our findings will aid in the development of new drugs that interfere with viral N 92 protein and viral replication in SARS-CoV-2, and highly related virus SARS-CoV. 93\n\nCloning, expression and purification 95\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 N-FL plasmid is a gift from Guangdong Medical Laboratory Animal Center. 96\n\nWe designed several constructs including: SARS-CoV-2 N-FL (residues from 1 to 419), SARS-97 author/funder.

The constructs were cloned into the pRSF-Duet-1 vector with N-terminal 6xHis-100 SUMO tag and expressed in E. coli strain Rosetta.

Briefly, 47-173 residues of SARS-CoV-2 N 152 protein were constructed, expressed and purified as described protocol (Materials and Methods). 153\n\nThe structure of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD was determined by molecular replacement using the 154 SARS-CoV N-NTD structure (PDB:2OG3) as the search model 24 . The final structure was refined 155 to R-factor and R-free values of 0.26 and 0.29, respectively. The complete statistics for data 156 collection, phasing and refinement are presented in Table 1 . Unlike to SARS-CoV N-NTD crystals 157 packing modes (monoclinic form at 2OFZ, cubic form at 2OG3) 24 , SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD crystal 158\n\nshows orthorhombic crystal packing form with four N-NTD monomers in one asymmetry unit 159 ( Fig. 2A) . Although lacks of evidence for real RNP organization in the mature virions, the 160 differences in the crystal packing patterns may implicate other potential contacts in SARS-CoV-161 2 RNP formation process. All four monomers in one asymmetric unit of the SARS-CoV-2 N-162 NTD crystal structure shared similar right-handed (loops)-(b-sheet core)-(loops) sandwiched 163 structure, as conserved among the CoVs N-NTD (Fig. 2B) . The b-sheet core is consisted of five 164 antiparallel b-strands with a single short 310 helix just before strand b2, and a protruding b-165 hairpin between strands b2 and b5. The b-hairpin is functionally important for CoV N-NTD, 166 implicated in mutational analysis of amino acid residues for RNA binding 29 (Fig. 2C) . The SARS-167\n\nCoV-2 N-NTD is enriched in aromatic and basic residues, folding into a hand shape resembles 168 with basic fingers that extend far beyond the b-sheet core, a basic palm, and an acidic wrist (Fig.  169   2D) . 170\n\nauthor/funder.

The most conserved residues distribute on the basic palm region (Fig. 3A, blue and  174 green region), while the less conserved residues locate in basic fingers and acidic wrist region 175 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.06.977876 doi: bioRxiv preprint SARS-CoV-2 one (Fig. 4A) . The N-terminal tail movement contributed to the change of N-NTD 213 surface charge distribution, at which nucleotide binding cavity became easier to accessible in 214 SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD ( Fig. 4B and C) . The second difference is on phosphate group binding site, 215 which SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD have larger sidechain residues (55 TA 56) compared with HCoV-216 OC43 N-NTD equivalents (67 SG 68) (Fig. 4D) . Structural superimposition suggested additional 217 polar properties of Thr 55 and Ala 56 in SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD may increase the steric clash with 218 ribonucleotide phosphate moiety ( Fig. 4E and F) . The third difference is on the edge of 219 nitrogenous base recognized hydrophobic pocket, where SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD had Arg 89 220 residues compared with HCoV-OC43 N-NTD Tyr 102 equivalents (Fig. 4G) . The change of these 221 residues sidechain may lead to dramatic decreasing of non-polar properties and increasing of 222 polar properties in the nitrogenous base binding site ( Fig. 4H and I) . To evaluate these different 223 observations in our structure, Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis experiments were next 224 performed to assess the binding affinity between SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD with all four kinds of 225 ribonucleotide AMP/UMP/CMP/GMP. Intriguingly, all ribonucleoside 5'-monophosphate, 226 excepted for GMP (KD value is 8 mM), shown little binding signals in assays (Fig. S4) . Taken 227 together, the above results suggested a potential distinct RNA binding patterns between SARS-228\n\nCoV-2 N protein with HCoV-OC43 N protein. 229\n\nStructure-based drug discovery has been shown to be an advance approach for the 231 development of new therapeutics.

Recent studies demonstrated 234 that N proteins will be a good drug-targeting candidate in other CoVs since they process several 235 critical functions, such as RNA genomic packing, viral transcription and assembly, in the 236 infectious cell 10 . However, the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 N protein is yet to be elucidated. 237\n\nHere, we present the 2.7 \u00c5 crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 N protein N-terminal domain, 238 revealing the specific surface charge distributions which may facilitate drug discovery specifically 239 to SARS-CoV-2 N protein ribonucleotide binding domain. \n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest 268\n\nThe structures in this paper are deposited to the Protein Data Bank with 6M3M access code. 270 author/funder.
