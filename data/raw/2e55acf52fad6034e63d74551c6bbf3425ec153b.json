Conversely, the sequences that do not involve a codon decoded by a tRNA with the \u233f39 modification et al., 1991, 1992). Table 3 shows that a 3.3-fold variation was found between the frameshifting efficiencies di-direct low-frameshifting efficiency. This observation prompted us to investigate the effect of the mutation of rected by these 16 IBV variant sites. Compared to the wt sequence, the frameshifting level is significantly reduced (p value \u03fd 10 \u03ea4 ) in ten of the mutants.\n\nThe dinucleotide situated 5\u0408 of the heptamer corresponds to the first two nucleotides of the preceding codon; its impact can thus be interpreted as an effect either of the amino acid, the codon, or the decoding tRNA. Because it was previously shown that tRNA modi- Two low-and two high-frameshift rate constructs which the UUUAAAC heptamer was mutated to UUU AUAC. In this case, tandem slippage should be ineffi-were tested in modification mutants (Table 4 ). With the low-frameshifting rate subset (frameshift efficiency cient due to the presence of two mismatches after repairing of the A site tRNA in the \u03ea1 frame, but single lower than 10%), pus3\u232c mutants show no significant effect (Table 4 ). In contrast, with the high-frameshifting slippage would not be affected. The frameshifting efficiency obtained with this construct was \u03fd0.1%, similar rate subset (frameshift efficiency higher than 18%), which involves decoding by a \u233f39 modified tRNA, a to the background level. This result demonstrates that in these experiments, frameshifting actually occurred reduced frameshifting frequency was observed in pus3\u232c mutants. This frequency was similar to that directed by through a tandem tRNA slippage mechanism. This implies that the three sites are involved in ribosomal frame-the low-frameshifting rate subset, indicating that most of the effect was reversed in the mutant. We verified shifting (see below). The \u233f39 modification is conserved over the tree of that the effect is actually due to the modifying activity of Pus3p and not to a possible chaperone-like activity life; its role on \u03ea1 frameshifting could thus be similar in a broad spectrum of organisms. This is consistent with by using the pus3[D151A] mutant, which harbors a mutation in the active site of the PUS3 protein. In this mutant, the fact that the bias at the two positions upstream of the heptamer was deduced from a wide variety of viruses the high-frameshifting constructs yield lower frameshifting efficiency, as in a pus3\u232c mutant context (Table 4) . of different origins. However, each host cell, like the yeast strains used here, carries a specific tRNA pool The effect of the dinucleotide upstream of the heptamer suggests that the three ribosomal site tRNAs are that differs from one organism to another. This could explain the different dinucleotide usage observed be-involved in the mechanism of \u03ea1 frameshifting. However, although the mechanism of frameshifting in eu-tween viruses; however, not enough sequence data are available to assess this point. In any case, the existence karyotes is thought to involve mostly tandem slippage of the tRNAs occupying the A and P sites, single slippage of a bias indicates an important role of tRNA modification on \u03ea1 frameshifting in eukaryotes. A role of tRNA at the P site has been reported to occur (Jacks et al., Brierley et al., 1997; Licznar et al., 2003) , during the accommodation step of the A-tRNA and not during the preceding decoding reaction (Nierhaus, 1990 ; but not in eukaryotes. In these cases, the tRNAs involved were acting at the A or P site. Noller et al., 2002) . However, in the case of a \u03ea1 frameshift event, E-tRNA release at the decoding step Overall, these results demonstrate that the effect of the upstream context of the heptamer is directed by the would facilitate the slippery event of A and P site tRNAs, and this precisely might be the effect of \u233f39.

Inconsistency of frameabout 6 \u00c5 , which is closer than the distance separating shifting patterns with accepted phylogenetic trees is not the A-and P-tRNAs.

E site tRNA nus members do not carry \u03ea1 frameshift sites but, is thus sufficiently connected to the P site to suggest rather, use \u03e91 frameshifting to express their polymerase that it very likely plays a role in promoting the stability domain.
