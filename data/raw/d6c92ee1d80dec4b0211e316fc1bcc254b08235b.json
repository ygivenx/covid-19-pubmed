Furthermore, shared characteristics of HIV-1 and FIV Fca ,, such as the worldwide distribution, the occurrence of recombinants, and high viral RNA loads in plasma suggest that FIV Fca , is a good model for HIV-1 (Carpenter et al., 1998; Yamamoto et al., 2002; Yamamoto et al., 2007) .\n\nIn other host species, such as the African lion (Panthero leo) and the North American cougar (Puma concolor), FIV is apparently less pathogenic than in the domestic cat (Carpenter and O'Brien, 1995; Carpenter et al., 1996; Bull et al., 2003; Brennan et al., 2006; Roelke et al., 2006) . The difference in the disease status of these hosts suggests that FIV has persisted in the lion and cougar much longer than FIV in the domestic cat, such that a period of host adaptation has occurred (Carpenter et al., 1996) . This hypothesis is also supported by a higher prevalence and greater genetic variation of FIV in lion and cougar populations compared to the domestic cat (Brown et al., 1994; Carpenter and O'Brien, 1995; Biek et al., 2003) . The similarity between FIV Fca , and HIV-1, and the difference between FIV Fca , and, for example, FIV Pco in the cougar, provide two important reasons for studying FIV Fca ,.\n\nHere we provide a general overview of the prevalence, subtypes and recombination of FIV Fca , and include some recent findings on the evolutionary rate and tissue distribution of FIV in the domestic cat. For this review, we define three categories of domestic cat populations: companion, feral, and stray. Companion cats are pets; owned by and reliant on humans. Feral cats are free-ranging, inhabit rural areas like forest and scrubland, and have minimal or no human contact. Stray cats are also free-ranging but inhabit urban areas and have some human contact.\n\nCompanion cat prevalence-Generally, the prevalence of FIV Fca , in companion cat populations worldwide is about 4-12 % (Courchamp and Pontier, 1994) . Companion cats in the USA and Canada have FIV prevalence at the lower end of the range, between 1 % and 7 % in low-risk and high-risk cats respectively (Shelton et al., 1989; Yamamoto et al., 1989; O'Connor et al., 1991) . In contrast, companion cats in Japan have a higher prevalence value, of up to 44 % in clinically ill cats, which is suggested to be the result of relatively higher cat density . The worldwide distribution of FIV Fca , in domestic cats is thought to be a result of low virulence levels and low rates of transmission of the virus (Fromont et al., 1997) .\n\nFeral cat prevalence-Worldwide studies of feral and free-ranging cats have found FIV Fca , prevalence of about 8-19 % (Baneth et al., 1999; Winkler et al., 1999; Ostrowski et al., 2003; Danner et al., 2007; Hayward, 2009 ) but see Carpenter et al. (1998) and Yamaguchi et al. (1996) . The higher FIV Fca , prevalence observed in feral cats compared to companion cats may be explained by differences in behavioural patterns and the main route of FIV transmission. Feral cats tend to be free-ranging and more aggressive in their interactions with other cats, and as such, have a higher frequency of biting encounters (Courchamp et al., 1998) . For this same reason, male, sexually mature cats are at the highest risk of FIV Fca , infection (Hosie et al., 1989; Courchamp et al., 1998; Levy et al., 2006) .\n\nFive FIV Fca , subtypes, A to E, (Fig. 1 ) have been established based on phylogenetic analyses of sequences from the env V3-V5 region (Sodora et al., 1994; Kakinuma et al., 1995; Pecoraro et al., 1996) . Recent papers have also used the gag gene to confirm the env clades (Kakinuma et al., 1995; Duarte et al., 2002; Steinrigl and Klein, 2003; Reggeti and Bienzle, 2004; Weaver et al., 2004; Hayward and Rodrigo, 2008) . Subtypes A, B and C are most widespread worldwide, with subtype D only found in Japan and Vietnam (Kakinuma et al., 1995; Nakamura et al., 2003) and subtype E only found in Argentina (Pecoraro et al., 1996) . The four subtypes A to D are found in cat populations from Japan (Kakinuma et al., 1995; Nishimura et al., 1998 ) but see Yamamoto et al. (2007) for worldwide FIV prevalence and subtype distribution details. There appears to be subtype-specific differences in disease, for example, subtype A infection has been reported to be associated with neurological disease (Nishimura et al., 1996; de Rozieres et al., 2008) while subtype B is less likely to be symptomatic (Bachmann et al., 1997) .\n\nIn addition, sequences of unknown subtype have been documented. Eleven FIV Fca , isolates from Texas were tentatively designated subtype F (Weaver et al., 2004) . More recently, these Texas sequences were assigned as a subclade within subtype B and the Portuguese sequences were proposed as subtype F ( Fig. 1 ) (Duarte and Tavares, 2006) . Furthermore, eighteen env sequences from New Zealand (NZ) cats have been identified as distinct from any previouslydescribed subtype, designated U-NZenv ( Fig. 1) (Hayward et al., 2007; Hayward and Rodrigo, 2008) . Phylogenetic analyses of gag and pol sequences from NZ cats also showed evidence of one and two unknown subtypes respectively, although the samples included in these unknown clades were not identical across the three genes (Hayward and Rodrigo, 2008) . The finding that the NZ env unknown subtype group is not monophyletic across the three main genes leads us to question the suitability of FIV Fca , subtyping using the env V3-V5 region only. In light of recent sequencing technologies and the HIV-1 nomenclature recommendations that at least two full-length genomes from epidemiologically-unrelated hosts are required to name a new subtype (Robertson et al., 1999) , a precautionary approach in designating new subtypes is suggested.\n\nThe Fel-O-Vax vaccine (Fort Dodge), which is commercially available in a number of countries including USA, Australia, Japan and NZ, confers protection against subtypes A, B and D but has not yet been tested on subtype C, despite the wide distribution of this subtype (Yamamoto et al., 2002; Kusuhara et al., 2005) . Furthermore, the findings of FIV strains of unknown subtypes suggest further testing of the vaccine in cat populations is warranted.\n\nFca , Retroviruses have been documented to have relatively rapid rates of recombination due to the presence of a diploid genome (that is, two identical copies of ssRNA) and the occurrence of multiple infection (Hu and Temin, 1990) . Naturally-occurring multiple FIV Fca , infection, either as a result of co-infection or superinfection, has been identified in cats from Australia, USA and NZ (Kyaw-Tanner and Robinson, 1996; Bachmann et al., 1997; Kann et al., 2007; Hayward and Rodrigo, 2008) . Several of these cases involve two strains of the same subtype (Kyaw-Tanner and Robinson, 1996; Hayward and Rodrigo, 2008) . Given that multiple infection is a prerequisite for recombination, it is expected that the level of multiple infection would be similar to the level of unique recombinants circulating in cat populations. However, intra-subtype recombination is difficult to document, because of the similarity of the parent strains involved (Hayward and Rodrigo, 2008) . It is important to note that recombination is only detected when the two parent strains are different but recombination does also occur in cells infected with virus whose genome is homodimeric, that is, when the two copies of the viral RNA are identical.\n\nFor clarity, here we distinguish between two types of recombinant sequences. Intragenic recombinant sequences include a crossover event within a single gene region while intergenic recombinants include a crossover between two gene regions. Intragenic recombinant FIV Fca , sequences from the env region have been isolated from cats in Canada (A/B), Japan (A/B, B/ D), NZ (A/C) and USA (A/B, A/C, A/B/C) (Bachmann et al., 1997; Carpenter et al., 1998; Reggeti and Bienzle, 2004; Hayward and Rodrigo, 2008) . Gag intragenic recombinant sequences have been found in samples from Canada (A/B, A/C) and NZ (A/C) (Reggeti and Bienzle, 2004; Hayward and Rodrigo, 2008) .\n\nAcross all studies, the env gene has the highest detected level of recombination. Indeed, about 6 % (n = 156) of NZ env sequences were found to be putative recombinants compared to 2 % (n = 48) of the gag sequences (Hayward and Rodrigo, 2008) . Immunologically, this is an expected result because env encodes the surface proteins, which are important in recognition of viruses by the host immune system, and therefore subject to positive selection (Flynn et al., 1995; Seibert et al., 1995) . High levels of variation, caused by a high evolutionary rate, are observed in this gene allowing the virus to escape the immune response. Recombination is one factor that aids in increasing the evolutionary rate of a virus (Coffin et al., 1997) . However, it is also possible that the reason for the greater number of recombination events observed in env is simply a consequence of our ability to better detect recombination in highly diverse regions.\n\nComplex intergenic recombination patterns, between subtypes A and undefined parent strains, have been identified from FIV Fca , sequences isolated from NZ cats (Fig. 2) (Hayward and Rodrigo, 2008) . For example, one cat was found with subtype A FIV in the env region, \"unknown\" subtype (most closely related to subtype C) FIV in the pol region, and subtype A FIV in the gag region. Sequences encompassing the whole FIV genome are needed to obtain a complete picture of the recombination events that have occurred between the different gene regions.\n\nOnly one published study has reported an evolutionary rate for FIV-Fca, of 3.4 \u00d7 10 \u22123 substitutions per site per year from the V1-V2 env region (Greene et al., 1993) . and was calculated from a single sequence from each of three serial samples taken one year apart from a naturally-infected cat. Recently, we estimated the evolutionary rate of the env V3-V6 region using a Bayesian coalescent method as implemented in the program BEAST (Drummond and Rambaut, 2007) . We used endpoint sequences generated from serial blood samples taken six to eleven months apart, from three FIV-infected NZ companion cats. A strict molecular clock model was used and the MCMC chain was run for 50,000,000 iterations. We used a prior to constrain the root of each tree and this was set to the age of each cat. Our estimates range from 3.1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 to 6.6 \u00d7 10 \u22123 substitutions per site per year (Hayward, 2009) , thus confirming Greene et al.'s earlier estimate (Table 1) .\n\nThe FIV Fca , evolutionary rate estimates are twice to three times higher than that found for the env region in the cougar FIV Pco strain using similar methods (Table 1) (Biek et al., 2003) . A higher rate for domestic cat FIV is expected because FIV Fca , is postulated to have a more recent origin than FIV Pco (Carpenter et al., 1996) . More recently-emerged viruses can be expected to have higher evolutionary rates than their ancestors because there has been no co-adaptation between the virus and new host species (Nelson and Holmes, 2007) . Likewise, HIV-1 in humans is considered a younger virus than FIV Fca ,, and the HIV-1 rate estimates are generally higher than that documented for FIV Fca , (Table 1) . However, multiple factors can affect evolutionary rate estimation, such as the evolutionary model, the gene region and the infection stage of the host (McGrath et al., 2001) .\n\nMoreover, we found evidence of positive selection in the FIV Fca , env sequences from two of the three NZ companion cats (Hayward, 2009 ). These two cats suffered numerous conditions typical of FIV infection and had relatively high proviral loads. We suggest that the high level of virus circulating in these two cats caused responses by the host's immune systems, which in turn resulted in genetic changes by the virus to evade the host immune response (Yamaguchi and Gojobori, 1997) . The positively-selected sites were generally identified in variable regions (Hayward, 2009) , possibly indicating the importance of variation in viral escape from the immune system. The third cat, with no evidence of positive selection, was the healthiest cat with the lowest proviral load and lowest average viral diversity (Hayward, 2009) . This result highlights the virus-host relationship in the early stages of infection. The lack of positive selection suggests that the immune system from this third cat is not eliciting a strong response to the presence of the virus.\n\nCompartmentalisation is the restriction of virus movement between different tissues or cell types (Nickle et al., 2003) . In HIV-1 infected individuals, it is suggested that compartmentalisation is a result of differential immune system pressures in the different tissue environments (Zhang et al., 2002; Kemal et al., 2003) . The genitourinary tract, CNS, lymph node and lung have all been documented as HIV-1 compartments when compared to peripheral blood in the same individuals (Ball et al., 1994; Itescu et al., 1994; Korber et al., 1994; Byrn et al., 1997; Coombs et al., 1998) . To date, an equivalent restriction of movement of FIV has not been published. Recently, we investigated the distribution of FIV Fca , env sequences in multiple tissues of sixteen feral cats (Hayward and Rodrigo, in prep) . In general, low intrahost diversity was found e.g. the FIV Fca , sequences isolated from the different tissues were very similar (Hayward and Rodrigo, in prep) .\n\nThis result could be due to recent infection events in the hosts, as it has been shown that HIV-1 populations are homogeneous in the initial stages of infection (Wolfs et al., 1992; Zhang et al., 1993; Zhu et al., 1993; Delwart et al., 2002) . Several cats had some diversity, however, with one cat providing the first known evidence of FIV compartmentalisation, that is, the sequences grouped in their tissue types more often than expected by chance alone (Hayward and Rodrigo, in prep) .\n\nFinally, two cases of dual infection in different tissue types were identified (Hayward and Rodrigo, in prep) . One cat had same-subtype dual infection in lung, liver and lymph node tissue samples (Hayward and Rodrigo, in prep) . The second cat was identified with subtypes C and \"unknown\" FIV in the popliteal lymph node (Hayward and Rodrigo, 2008) and lung tissue samples (Hayward and Rodrigo, in prep) . These findings emphasise the freedom of virus movement between the tissue types and suggest recent infection events.\n\nAlthough FIV in the domestic cat was first isolated more than twenty years ago, research is still ongoing to learn more about this lentiviral relative of HIV. Comparisons to FIV in larger cats, such as the North American cougar and the African lion, help to explain disease differences from an evolutionary perspective. One of the more significant opportunities for research involves the notion that FIV has adapted to its host in those species where it persists endemically. The biological and evolutionary mechanics of host adaptation is still an open question and FIV may be an appropriate model system to study this.\n\nAs this review highlights, further research is still required, in particular, to resolve recombination patterns and novel unknown subtypes, with further testing of the currently available vaccine.
