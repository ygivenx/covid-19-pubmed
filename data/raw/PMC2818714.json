{"title": "Mathematical Modeling of the Effectiveness of Facemasks in Reducing the Spread of Novel Influenza A (H1N1)", "body": "Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 spreads through person-to-person contact, airborne particles, coughing and sneezing, and by fomites [1], therefore, the use of facemasks is a logical line of defense. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have interim recommendations on the use of facemasks and respirators for the current pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. The CDC defines the term facemask as a disposable mask cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a medical device, such as surgical masks. Surgical masks are designed to help stop droplets from being spread by the person wearing the mask, not to protect against breathing in very small particle aerosols that may contain viruses [8]. We will use of the term \u2018respirator\u2019 for an N95 or higher filtering facepiece respirator certified by the CDC/National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH); a respirator is designed to protect the person wearing the mask against breathing in very small particles that may contain viruses [8]. The CDC states that the effectiveness of the use of facemasks and respirators in various settings is unknown and do not generally recommend the use of facemasks or respirators in home or community settings nor in non-medical occupational settings [8]. In certain circumstances the CDC recommends the use of masks for individuals who are at high risk of infection and cannot avoid situations with potential exposure to the disease [8].\n\nThere have been a handful of studies that have analyzed the effectiveness of facemasks against nanoparticles in the size range of viruses using manikin-based protocol in which the masks were sealed on the manikin's face so that no leakage would occur [9]\u2013[11]. All three studies show similar results in penetration percentage for the N95 respirator. The high fit N95 respirator had penetration percentages from about 0.5% to 2.5% at 30 l/min and from about 0.5% to 5% at 85 l/min [9]\u2013[11]. The low fit N95 respirator had penetration percentages from about 1.5% to 3.5% at 30 l/min and from about 1.5% to 6% at 85 l/min [9]\u2013[11]. The surgical masks tested in Balazy et al.'s [10] study show a much greater penetration percentage. At 30 l/min one model of surgical mask (SM1) allowed 20\u201380% of particles to penetrate the mask, while another model (SM2) allowed 2\u201315% [10]. At 85 l/min SM1 allowed penetration of 30\u201385% of particles while SM2 allowed 5\u201321% [10]. The N95 respirator in a sealed manikin test seems to be fairly effective against nanoparticles, almost holding up to its 95% certification. The surgical masks are not as effective, allowing a much greater percentage of particles to pass through to the wearer even when sealed tightly to a manikin.\n\nUnfortunately, this type of testing does not provide an accurate estimate of the level of protection for everyday use of a mask by a person. While these studies provide data on the actual protection of masks against nanoparticles in a perfect setting, it does not take into consideration that a mask will not be completely sealed on an individual nor will it fit perfectly. Furthermore, one must consider that an individual will not always be wearing the mask, for example, a mask will be taken off to eat and sleep, or possibly because it becomes uncomfortable to wear.\n\nLee et al. [12] performed a study on N95 respirators and surgical masks using human subjects. The challenge aerosol used was NaCl, with particles in the size range of bacteria and viruses (.04\u20131.3m). They tested four models of N95 respirators: 1) high protection level, 2) medium protection level, 3) exhalation valve, and 4) exhalation without valve and three models of surgical masks: 1) high protection level, 2) medium protection level, and 3) low protection level. The results from the study showed that the lowest protection offered from N95 respirators is when particles are in the size range of 0.08\u20130.2m and for surgical masks when particles are in the size range of 0.04\u20130.32m. The size range of influenza virus is in the range of 0.08\u20130.12m, which falls into both masks most penetrating particle size range. The N95 respirator was found to be 21.5% effective and the surgical mask was 2.4% effective in protecting against nanoparticles. The N95 respirator provides approximately nine times greater protection than a surgical mask and is clearly a better option in protecting against infection.\n\nA University of Michigan School of Public Health study led by Dr. Allison Aiello [13] is evaluating the effectiveness of hand-washing and facemasks in preventing influenza from spreading. The study, called M-FLU, conducted a randomized cluster intervention trial among students living in dorm housing. The students were randomly separated into two intervention groups, one wearing masks and practicing hand hygiene, one just wearing masks, and also in a control group. The study was carried out over the 2006\u20132007 influenza season, which was a mild season. The study found that facemasks and hand hygiene were correlated with a 35\u201351% reduction in influenza-like illness [13].\n\nThere are many factors that influence people's willingness to wear a mask. In a study by Tang and Wong [14] a total of 1,329 adult Chinese residing in Hong Kong were surveyed on their use of facemasks during the 2003 SARS epidemic. Overall 61.2% of the respondents reported the consistent use of facemasks to prevent contracting the disease. The study found that women in the age group 50\u201359 and married respondents were more likely to wear facemasks, suggesting that the aesthetics of wearing a facemask may be a concern. Also, the study found that individuals who had a university education or earned more than US$5,000 per month were more likely to wear a mask. Tang and Wong also showed that perceived susceptibility, cues to action, and perceived benefits, were significant predictors in whether or not an individual consistently wore a mask.\n\nThe effective reproduction number, , is the average number of secondary cases produced by a typical infectious individual during the infectious period [16], [17]. The effectiveness of intervention strategies are often measured by their ability to reduce the spread of a disease in a given population. In an epidemic model the magnitude of the effective reproduction number, , determines whether or not an epidemic occurs and its severity [15]. When , the number of infections grow and an epidemic occurs, however when , the number of infections does not increase and there is no epidemic outbreak [15].\n\nWithout any interventions the model has an initial effective reproduction number (uncontrolled)  given by:(4)\n\n\nThis  is the product of the average number of people infected per unit time  and the weighted sum of the average infectious period  plus the average incubation period .\n\nThe \u2018next-generation operator\u2019 approach [17] is used to find an expression for the effective reproduction number (controlled)  for our epidemic model when masks are used as an intervention strategy. The computation is done by linearizing the system of equations (2) around the disease-free equilibrium (DFE). The DFE has E, , I, and  equal to zero with , , and  positive. Since there is no immunity from previous infection or vaccination  is also equal to zero. The resulting four-dimensional linearized system is of the form , where(5)\n\n\n\n\nThe effective reproduction number  is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix \n[17]. Hence  is the only non-zero eigenvalue of the matrix  and is given by the expression:(6)\n\nwhere , , , , and .\n\nWe use equations 4 and 7 to define the effective reproduction number for the model as:where  is the threshold number of infected individuals at which masks start to be used.\n\nThe epidemiology of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 is not accurately known since it continues to spread across the world. The parameter values shown in Table 2 were chosen based on the best available data. The incubation period for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 has been reported to be 2\u201310 days with a mean of 6 days [18]. The mean time in the exposed classes E and  corresponding to the incubation period has been assumed to be 6 days, making the transfer rate to the infectious classes, I and , constant at  = 1/6.\n\nThe infectious period is believed to be between four and seven days, with an average of five days [19], [20]. Thus, the baseline value for the recovery rate is constant at  = 1/5. The fatality rate of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 is thought to be in the range of 0.3%\u20131.5%, with a mean of 0.46% [21]\u2013[23]. The case fatality rate for our model is , setting this equal to 0.0046 results in .\n\nThe current estimates on the transmission of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 are that one infected person may typically infects one to two people [24]\u2013[26]. The transmissibility, , is the product of the susceptibility of the population, the infectivity of the disease, and the number of contacts an individual has in a day [27], [28]. The susceptibility of the population is set to one, as it is believed few people are immune to pandemic (H1N1) 2009, and the number of contacts an individual has per day is assumed to be 16 [29]. The infectivity is found by , so that  = 1.8 in a completely susceptible population and the infectivity is .0141. So  gives the transmission rate, the fraction of contacts per day that is sufficient for the transmission of pandemic (H1N1) 2009.\n\nThe baseline population size N for the model is set at one million people and all are initially in the susceptible class S. The initial infected fraction, I/N, is set at 0.00001 so that when N = 1000000, I = 10. The model scales linearly so that the initial population size N and the initial number of infected individuals I are both scaled up or down by the same factor. We assume that individuals will start wearing masks after 100 people are infected, once there is enough number of cases in a community to convince people to start wearing masks. We analyzed the impact of masks when 10%, 25%, and 50% of the population wear them.\n\nUsing the studies published on the effectiveness of masks we determined the baseline values for the effectiveness of N95 respirators to be  = 0.2 and  = 0.5 and for the surgical masks  = 0.02 and  = 0.05 [12]. The effectiveness of masks in decreasing the infectivity of a sick individual is greater because the mask contains the virus particles, preventing them from becoming airborne, and therefore preventing the contamination of surrounding surfaces as well as people [30].\n\nAlthough it is possible that some sick individuals may change their behavior due to the symptoms [15], we assume that sick individuals will not change their behavior and continue to have the same number of daily contacts as a healthy individual. Therefore, we set the baseline value for the reduced number of contacts due to illness  at 1, as people usually do not greatly alter their daily behavior during the incubation period. Individuals in the exposed classes, E and , are thought to be 50% less infectious due to incubation than those in the infected classes, I and , so we set  = 0.5 [19], [31].\n\nThe effective reproduction number  determines the average number of secondary cases resulting from one typical infectious individual during the infectious period without the implementation of facemasks. Since there is a delay in the implementation of facemasks the initial growth of the epidemic is affected by . The estimates of  for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vary widely, the common range is assumed to be between 1.2 and 2.2. As the value of  increases the number of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 cases increases significantly as shown graphically in Figure 4.\n\nThe effectiveness of the mask greatly affects the number of cumulative cases. The higher the effectiveness the fewer number of cases (shown in the Results section). The effectiveness of the masks not only depends upon the type of mask and quality but also proper usage.\n\nThe number of initially infected individuals can have a major impact on the size of the epidemic. In Figure 5 we vary the number of initially infected individuals in the population.\n\nWe consider variations in the percentage of the population that wears masks. We look at the effect of 10%, 25% and 50% of the population wearing masks. The model shows that the higher the percentage of the population wearing masks the fewer the number of cumulative cases, this is shown in Figure 6.\n\nThe epidemic is sensitive to the delay in the implementation of masks as seen in Figure 7. We look at the cumulative number of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 cases for the N95 respirator when 10% of the population is wearing masks. Figure 7 shows that the earlier masks are implemented, the bigger the reduction in the cumulative number of cases.\n\nThe model is sensitive to who wears masks. Here we look at the effect if only infected individuals wear masks and if only susceptible and exposed individuals would wear masks. Figure 8 shows that it is important for both infected, as well as susceptible and exposed individuals, to wear masks.\n\nThe standard mitigation strategies used for influenza viruses are vaccines and antivirals. However, in the case of a novel virus these may not be readily available and other mitigation strategies will be needed. As seen during the 2003 SARS outbreak and the current pandemic (H1N1) 2009 people are willing to wear facemasks to reduce the spread of disease. We used a mathematical model to examine the possible impact of N95 respirators and surgical masks on reducing the spread of pandemic (H1N1) 2009. When modeled with a low mask effectiveness and a small fraction of the population wearing masks, the implementation of facemasks still has a relatively large impact on the size of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009.\n\nThe numerical simulation results in the results section show that without any interventions, we predict that a large percentage of the population will be infected with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza strain. This result is not surprising as the population is 100% susceptible and the effective reproduction number  is 1.83, which is higher than that of typical seasonal influenza. In reality, the  may be lower due to heterogeneous mixing patterns, pre-existing immunity, and other interventions in place. With 10% of the population wearing N95 respirators with effectiveness at 20% in reducing both susceptibility and infectivity there is a 19% reduction in the cumulative number of cases. With the same mask effectiveness but 25% of the population wearing N95 respirators, the total number of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 cases is reduced by almost 30% and with 50% of the population wearing masks, it results in over a 36% reduction in the number of cases.\n\nThe effectiveness of surgical masks is low, therefore the impact of wearing them during an epidemic is not significant. Even at 50% effectiveness in reducing both susceptibility and infectivity and with 50% of the population wearing surgical masks only a 6% reduction in the number of cumulative cases is seen.\n\nThe sooner an epidemic is recognized and masks are implemented, the bigger the reduction in the number of cases will be. As seen in the results section the epidemic is sensitive to the delay in implementing masks. The difference in the total number of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 cases when masks are implemented at 100 infected individuals and 1,000 infected individuals is over 7%.\n\nThe implementation of neither N95 respirators nor surgical masks lowered the effective reproduction number  below one. However, N95 respirators greatly decreased , in some scenarios very close to one. While facemasks will not stop the pandemic (H1N1) 2009, they could greatly reduce its severity and allow for more time to develop effective vaccines and antivirals.\n\nThere are currently more trials being conducted on the effectiveness of surgical masks and N95 respirators [32], which will allow us to refine the assumptions made in the model. However, it must be noted that in order for masks to be effective they must be: (1) available, (2) affordable, (3) worn properly, (4) replaced or sanitized daily, and (5) N95 respirators should be fit-tested. Only 10% of the population would have to wear masks in order to reduce the percentage of cases by 20%. Facemasks are inexpensive, relatively easy to implement, and would not cause a large economic burden to society. Masks are a powerful tool and can be used by countries with limited supplies of antiviral drugs and vaccines. In addition, economically feasible preventative global mitigations will benefit the world as a whole. We can conclude from our model that N95 respirators if worn properly are an effective intervention strategy in reducing the spread of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009."}
