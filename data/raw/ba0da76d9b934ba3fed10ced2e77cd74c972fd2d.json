{"title": "SARS coronavirus spike protein-induced innate immune response occurs via activation of the NF-B pathway in human monocyte macrophages in vitro", "body": "The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) epidemic of 2003 has rekindled an interest in coronavirus interaction with the host innate immune system. The SARS-CoV-induced disease, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) is associated with a major inflammatory component. Increased cytokine and chemokine production in response to virus infection has been the focus of several investigations (Frieman et al., 2008) .\n\nPeripheral blood monocyte macrophages (PBMC) are a tool for investigation of host response and mechanism of pathogenesis. PBMC may become activated by encountering SARS-CoV and recruit neutrophils, monocytes and immune responders such as natural killer (NK), T, and B cells to the site to shape early adaptive immunity (He et al., 2003 (He et al., , 2006 . PBMC may also carry the virus to other sites such as the liver and brain and cause disease or persist for some time (Shao et al., 2006) . cleaved during maturation. The large external S1 domain binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the major cellular receptor found on ciliated nasotracheal epithelial cells, lung alveolar cells and intestinal enterocytes but not found on T cells, B cells or macrophages in the spleen and lymphoid organs (Li et al., 2003b; Chen and Subbarao, 2007) . Virions have uncleaved viral spikes and during entry through endocytic vesicles or through fusion at the plasma membrane, viral spikes are cleaved by cathepsin L Bosch et al., 2008) . Trypsin cleavage of the spike prior to infection also permits entry through the plasma membrane (Bosch et al., 2008) . Factor Xa, a membrane bound protease, cleaves SARS S protein into functional S1 and S2 subunits and allows viral entry (Du et al., 2007) .\n\nThe S2 trimers direct membrane fusion. S2 contains a hydrophobic fusion peptide close to the N-terminus, heptad repeat regions HR1 and HR2, and is followed by the transmembrane domain (TMD) with a (putative palmytoylated) cysteine rich region and by the carboxyterminal cytoplasmic domain (Frieman et al., 2008; Thorp et al., 2006) . The HR2 region contains a leucine zipper domain important for oligomerization (Corver et al., 2007; Luo et al., 1999) . There are 65 spike trimers per SARS-CoV virion (Beniac et al., 2006) .\n\nWe sought to determine the functions that affect inflammatory responses in monocyte macrophages exposed to SARS-CoV spike protein. We focused on interaction of cell membranes with the virion envelope protein responsible for the initiation of infection.\n\nPurified recombinant truncated spike (S) protein, SARS-CoV Urbani strain, GenBank accession number AY278741) was obtained from Protein Sciences Corporation, Meriden, CT and used as recommended. S protein was fully glycosylated, partially trimeric and active in binding to ACE2 in an ELISA assay (K. Rizzo, Protein Sciences Corp., personal communication). The purified product contained <0.15 endotoxin units (EU) per g of S protein. The recombinant S protein consisted of the spike extracellular domain truncated at amino acid 1190 and was expressed in expressSF + insect cells from recombinant baculovirus D3252. The truncation removed the C-terminal TMD (Transmembrane domain) and cytoplasmic tail but retained the HR2 region that contains a leucine zipper domain important for oligomerization (Luo et al., 1999) . S protein was stored at \u221280 \u2022 C and was stable at 4 \u2022 C for one week (Song et al., 2004) .\n\nPurified, recombinant SARS-CoV E protein (E protein) was obtained from Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository (beiresources), Manassas, VA. The purified E protein we obtained was a bacterially expressed E protein that had contained an N-terminal his tag which was removed by proteolysis and was further purified by nickel affinity chromatography. We found that the purified E protein had endotoxin activity. To remove the contaminating endotoxin we used DetoxiGel endotoxin removing columns. (Pierce Biotechnology) A 1 ml column of settled resin was loaded with 10 g/ml E protein dissolved in 0.1 M PBS. The eluate fraction containing E protein was collected by gravity flow and stored at \u221280 \u2022 C.\n\nPeripheral blood was obtained from healthy volunteers. Leukocytes were separated by centrifugation through Ficoll-Paque Plus (Amersham Biosciences) (Collins, 2002) . The PBMC were washed twice and viable cells brought to a final concentration of 1.25 \u00d7 10 6 mL \u22121 . Monocytes were enriched by adsorption onto 25 cm 2 culture flasks and incubated 3-4 days at 37 \u2022 C in RPMI 1640 Supplemented (containing 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, non-essential amino acids) and 10% autologous serum (decomplemented, clarified).\n\nHCoV-229E was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and was propagated in MRC-5, human fetal lung cells obtained from ViroMed, Minnetonka, MN. MRC-5 cells were grown in minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10%, v/v FBS (Invitrogen). HCoV-229E infections were performed at a MOI of 1 and incubated at 37 \u2022 C. HCoV-229E infectious virus was quantitated by plaque assay in MRC-5 cells (Collins and Grubb, 1998) .\n\nSARS pseudovirus bearing SARS-CoV S protein and a defective HIV-1 genome expressing luciferase as reporter was prepared as previously described (He et al., 2004) In brief, 293 cells were cotransfected with pSARS encoding SARS-CoV S protein and pNL4-3.luc.RE encoding Env-defective, luciferase-expressing HIV-1 genome (plasmids obtained from Yuxian He, New York Blood Center, New York, NY) using Fugene 6 reagents (Boeringer-Mannheim). Supernatants containing SARS pseudovirus were harvested 48 h post-transfection and used for single cycle infection. To assay for SARS pseudovirus infectivity, hACE2-293 cells were incubated with dilutions of SARS pseudovirus for 48 h. The cells were then assayed for luciferase activity expressed as relative light units (RLU) using a luciferase kit (Promega, Madison WI).\n\nHEK293T (293) cells were a gift from M. Garrick, SUNY at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY. hACE2-293 cells were a gift from Y. He, New York Blood Center, New York, NY. Both cell lines were propagated in DMEM supplemented with 10%, v/v FBS. hTLR2-293 cells were purchased from InvivoGen, Carlsbad, CA and propagated in DMEM supplemented with 10%, v/v FBS and 10 g/ml blasticidin.\n\nThe human monocytic cell line THP-1 was obtained from ATCC and cultured in RPMI 1640 Supplemented (containing 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, non-essential amino acids) plus 10%, v/v FBS and 0.05 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. Undifferentiated, non-adherent THP-1 cells (1 \u00d7 10 6 cells/25 cm 2 /flask) became differentiated and adherent after incubating the cultures for 24 h with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (Sigma) at a final concentration of 100 nM.\n\nSARS-CoV S and E envelope proteins were diluted in RPMI medium to treat in vitro PBMC cultures (2 \u00d7 10 5 cells/flask). To simulate a virus-cell interaction, cultures were washed twice in RPMI 1640, treated with various doses of S protein, (0.28-28 nM) or E protein, (0.5-25 nM) in 200 l RPMI 1640 per 25 cm 2 /flask, or mock-treated, then incubated for 30 min on ice, then 30 min at 37 \u2022 C. 5 ml RPMI 1640 Supplemented was then added and cultures were returned to 37 \u2022 C. At 18-24 h, cytoplasmic RNA was extracted from the cells. In some experiments, aliquots of 0.5 ml supernatant medium were collected at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 h of incubation for subsequent ELISA assay for secreted cytokines. Nuclear cell fractions were assayed for active NK-B transcription factor (Section 2.8).\n\nStimulation through toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in hTLR2-293 cells was performed using as a control, TLR2 agonist, mycobacterial lipomannan (LM-MS from M. smegmatis) (InvivoGen) at 10 ug/ml (Elass et al., 2005) .\n\nmRNA abundance was studied comparing control and S proteintreated PBMC cultures with GEArray Q series Human Inflammatory Cytokines and Receptors Gene Array, (SuperArray Bioscience Corporation, Bethesda, MD). RNA was extracted using TriReagent following the method for cell lysates (Molecular Research Center, Inc. Cincinnati, OH) and stored in 90% ethanol at \u221280 \u2022 C. 1-5 g of RNA was amplified and labeled with biotin-16-dUTP to create a cDNA probe using the Ampolabeling LPR Probe Synthesis Kit. (SuperArray Bioscience Corporation, Bethesda, MD). Bound probe was detected with Chemiluminescent Detection Kit (SuperArray Bioscience Corporation, Bethesda, MD). For the NF-B Pathway responses (Oligo GEArray DNA Microarray, SuperArray Bioscience Corporation) which included IL-8, total RNA was further purified using RNeasy columns according to manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and a biotin-16-UTP cRNA probe was prepared using the RNA TrueLabeling-AMP 2.0 Kit (SuperArray Bioscience Corporation, Bethesda, MD).\n\nBriefly, after 1-2 h of prehybridization at 60 \u2022 C the probe was hybridized overnight at 60 \u2022 C, washed with several low and high stringency washes and the bound probe was then reacted with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin and detected on the array with CDP-star chemiluminescent substrate. The chemiluminescent array image was captured using a cooled Fuji Imager CCD camera. The parameters selected used a local background correction subtraction and were normalized to GAPDH as a control on each array. GAPDH was normalized to 1.0, which gave a value to which other induced expression could be compared. This allowed for the comparison of densities as relative amounts expressed.\n\nThe relative intensity of the array spots was analyzed using GEArray Expression Analysis Suite 2.0 software (SuperArray Bioscience Corporation, Bethesda, MD).\n\nThe average intensity from multiple spots of individual genes on each array was compiled. Paired t-tests on normalized intensities with p values \u22640.05 from three or more independent experiments were used to generate a list of genes with significant changes in gene expression between control and S protein-treated samples. Only those that were reproducibly changed in independent experiments were analyzed further.\n\nQuality control measures included subtracting baseline and setting housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) to one for all arrays. A comparison analysis was performed for the S protein-treated sample against its corresponding mock-treated control as the baseline 'signal'. Fold change was calculated from the signal ratio after normalizing the control signal values to 1. Activity analyses (ELISA) were performed on selected genes to confirm a biological function.\n\nResults were expressed as means \u00b1 SD or \u00b1SE. Comparisons of values for test results from multiple individual donors of PBMC or from cultured cells were evaluated by Student's t-test for paired samples (p value) (Wolk, 2008) 2.8. ELISA assays for secreted cytokines and chemokines PBMC cultures were treated with S protein, E protein, or mock treated as described (Section 2.3), and the culture medium was sampled at various times post-treatment to assay for secreted cytokines by ELISA. Media samples were stored at 4 \u2022 C. IL-8/CXCL8, MIP-1\u2424, IL-1\u2424, IL-6 and TNF\u2423 protein secretion into culture medium was quantitated using highly specific and sensitive ELISA kits. Quantikine ELISA kits were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and performed as described by the manufacturer. The sensitivities are: IL-8/CXCL8 assay is 1.5-7.5 pg/ml, MIP-1\u2424 assay is <4 pg/ml, IL-1\u2424 assay is <1 pg/ml, IL-6 assay is <0.70 pg/ml, TNF\u2423 assay is 0.5-5.5 pg/ml. Secreted cytokine and chemokine levels were compared based on picograms per ml of culture medium.\n\nFor quantification of active NF-B transcription factor, nuclear fractions of S treated and mock-treated PBMC were assayed with the EZ-Detect NF-B p65 Transcription Factor Kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford IL). This method has been published in detail (Rosenau et al., 2004) . 1 \u00d7 10 4 \u2212 2 \u00d7 10 5 mock-treated PBMC (control), and PBMC treated with 11.2 nM S protein for 24 h were harvested by incubation with Versene (Invitrogen) at room temperature for 10 min and scraping into cold PBS. Adherent THP-1 cells (1 \u00d7 10 6 cells/flask) were similarly treated. Cytoplasmic and nuclear cell fractions were prepared using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (Pierce, Rockford IL). TNF\u2423-activated PBMC nuclear extract was used as a positive control. PBMC were stimulated with 50 ng/ml recombinant human TNF\u2423 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis MN) for 15 min, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described above. (Davis et al., 2001) All nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were immediately placed at \u221270 \u2022 C.\n\nProtein concentration was determined by MicroBCA Protein Assay (Pierce Protein Research Products, Rockford IL). 5-10 l (1 g) of nuclear extract was incubated in wells coated with NF-B p65 consensus sequence for 1 h. Only the active form of NF-B transcription factor binds to the consensus sequence in the wells. After the first incubation, the wells were washed and incubated with specific primary antibody to NF-B p65 for 1 h. After incubation with the primary antibody, the wells were washed and incubated with a secondary HRP-conjugated antibody for 1 h, then washed. A chemiluminescent substrate was added to the wells and the resulting signal was detected using a luminometer (BioTek Multifunction Plate Reader Winooski, VT). Active NF-B transcription factor was reported as luminescence per ug protein.\n\nTPCK, N-Tosyl-L-Phenylalanine Chloromethyl Ketone (Sigma Products, St. Louis, MO), an irreversible inhibitor of serine proteases with chymotrypsin-like specificity, was prepared as 10 mM stock in ethanol and stored at 4 \u2022 C. TPCK, 25 M in RPMI 1640 medium, was used as an NF-B inhibitor (Henkel et al., 1993) . TPCK acts by inhibiting IKB\u2423 protease so that IKB\u2423 is not proteolytically degraded and NF-B is not released to undergo nuclear translocation (Henkel et al., 1993) . Briefly, for treatment with S protein or HCoV-229E virus, PBMC cultures were pretreated with 25 M TPCK for 20 min on ice, then stimulated with S protein (Section 2.3) or HCoV-229E virus (Section 2.2) and incubated in medium with 25 M TPCK for up to 24 h (Jovasevic et al., 2008) . TPCK effect on virus production in infected cells was measured by plaque assay of the culture supernatant.\n\nqRT-PCR was used to quantitate the effect of S and E proteins on IL-8 cytokine mRNA abundance. The RNA from in vitro PBMC cultures was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the reverse transcriptase kit from Promega (Promega Inc, Madison WI). Relative abundance of each mRNA species was quantitated using real-time quantitative PCR using specific primers: \u2424-Actin, (Primers were synthesized by Invitrogen or Integrated DNA Technologies, Skokie, IL.) Using Brilliant \u00ae SYBR \u00ae green Q-PCR master mix from Stratagene (Stratagene Inc, La Jolla CA.) to provide precise quantification of initial target in each PCR reaction, the amplification plot was examined at a point during the early log phase of product accumulation. This is accomplished by assigning a fluorescence threshold above background and determining the time point at which each sample's amplification plot reached the threshold (defined as the threshold cycle number or C T ). The threshold is a numerical value assigned automatically by the software for each run above the calculated baseline. The C T value assigned to a particular sample thus reflects the point during the amplification reaction at which sufficient number of amplicons has accumulated above the baseline. After a suitable threshold is selected, the data are analyzed and C T values for each sample determined. Differences in threshold cycle number (C T ) are used to quantify the relative amount of PCR target contained within each tube. Relative expression of mRNA species is calculated using the comparative C T method. Briefly, for each sample, the difference in C T values ( C T ) was calculated for each mRNA by taking the mean C T of duplicate tubes and subtracting the mean C T of the duplicate tubes for the reference RNA (\u2424-Actin) measured on an aliquot from the same RT-reaction.\n\nThe C T for the treated sample was then subtracted from the C T for the untreated control sample to generate a C T .\n\nThe mean of these C T measurements was then used to calculate the expression of the test gene relative to the reference gene and normalized to the untreated control as follows:\n\nTranscript Accumulation Index(TAI)or Relative Expression = 2 \u2212 C T This calculation assumes that all PCR reactions are working with 100% efficiency. All PCR efficiencies were found to be >95%; therefore this assumption introduces minimal error into the calculations.\n\nTo investigate the effect of treatment with S protein on the inflammatory response, we compared relative abundance of mRNA species of treated and mock-treated PBMC using microarray analysis. The paired t-test was used to detect mRNA species with statistically significant differences in expression, p \u2264 0.05. Fig. 1 is   Fig. 1 . Differential mRNA abundances determined by a microarray focused on immunologically relevant genes after treatment of PBMC (2 \u00d7 10 5 cells) with 11.2 nM S protein for 24 h. Statistically significant (p value <0.05) differences in mRNA abundance were identified using the student's t-test by comparing treated with mock-treated culture from three or more independent experiments. Sixteen differences in mRNA abundance were identified. 1 CXCL10 was further analyzed by qRT-PCR. Fig. 2 . S protein-treated PBMC synthesized and secreted significantly (p < 0.05) more of IL-8, MIP-1\u2424, IL-6, IL-1\u2424 inflammatory cytokines than the control. PBMC (2 \u00d7 10 5 cells) were cultured with and without 11.2 nM S protein for 24 h and supernatants were assayed for cytokines by ELISA. Mean \u00b1 SE of three or more independent experiments is shown. p values were determined by student's t-test comparing S protein-treated and mock-treated control culture. TNF\u2423 p = ns. the summary of genes identified by the analysis. Treatment with S protein increased the abundance of CCL15 mRNA by 2.2-fold (p = 0.033), CCL16 mRNA by 1.6-fold (p = 0.033) and CCL19 mRNA by 1.7-fold (p = 0.011). These chemokines chemo attract and activate monocytes. Cytokine IL-12A mRNA, which activates natural killer (NK) cells increased 2.36-fold (p = 0.021). Interestingly, S protein treatment increased CXCL10 mRNA abundance by 5.5-fold (p = 0.029) and CXCL11 mRNA by 2.2-fold (p = 0.014). These genes are modulated by virus infection (Cheung et al., 2005; Tseng et al., 2005) . Only CXCL10 mRNA abundance was verified by qRT-PCR, which showed transcript accumulation increasing 6.4-8.0-fold in response to S protein.\n\nS protein treatment also increased leptin mRNA 2.2-fold (p = 0.031). Leptin has immunoregulatory activity. CCR5 (the receptor for CCL5, CCL4, CCL3) mRNA increased 1.3-fold (p = 0.022). Chemokine receptor XCR1 increased 1.9-fold (p = 0.004.) LTBR, a receptor for TNF, increased 3.5-fold (p = 0.048.) (by qRT-PCR, LTBR did not increase more than 2-fold). Cytokine receptors IL-10RA and IL17R increased 2.3-fold (p = 0.046) and 1.45-fold (p = 0.016) respectively. The fold increases were not further verified by qRT-PCR, however, they suggested that the viral S protein acts as an inflammatory stimulus in PBMC.\n\nPBMC treated with S protein showed increased abundance of mRNAs for MIP-1\u2424 1.3-fold (p = 0.12, ns), IL-1\u2424 3-fold (p = 0.12, ns), IL-8 3.7-fold (p = 0.34, ns), IL-6 7-fold (p = 0.016) and TNF\u2423 7.5-fold (p = 0.12, ns). Production and secretion of these protective cytokines and chemokines after treatment of PBMC with S protein was further analyzed.\n\nIn addition to mRNA abundance studies we also quantitated inflammatory cytokine and chemokine activities by ELISA assay. In vitro PBMC (2 \u00d7 10 5 ) were treated with 11.2 nM S protein for 24 h. Supernatant medium from the cultures was tested for cytokines by the Quantikine ELISA assay. The results were expressed as pg/ml and the percentage increase in the secreted cytokine in S protein-treated versus mock-treated was compared. We observed that the treatment with S protein increased the levels of secreted IL-8, MIP-1\u2424, IL-6, IL-1\u2424 from in vitro PBMC, Fig. 2 . S protein-treated cells produced significantly more IL-8 (453%, p = 0.008), MIP-1\u2424 (646%, p = 0.008), IL-6 (>297%, p = 0.027), IL-1\u2424 (285%, p = 0.03). The increase in TNF\u2423 mRNA abundance was not significant (364%, p = 0.064, ns). Our results showed increased production and secretion of protective cytokines and chemokines after treatment of PBMC with S protein. Fig. 3 . Production and secretion of IL-8 was significantly increased in PBMC after treatment with S protein. The kinetics and dose response effect of S protein on in vitro PBMC 3, 6 and 9 h after treatment with S protein (0.28, 2.8 and 5.6 nM) were evaluated. Secreted IL-8 is expressed as pg/ml (mean \u00b1 SE of three separate experiments). Statistical significance was determined using the student's t-test based on comparison of S protein-treated with the mock-treated control for each time point. Our results indicated that S protein treatment increased IL-8 production in a dose dependent manner and that 5.6 nM gave a statistically significant response compared to control.\n\nData presented in Fig. 3 show the effect of concentration of S protein on synthesis and secretion of the chemokine IL-8 by PBMC into the culture supernatants as measured by ELISA. Kinetic studies performed at 3, 6 and 9 h of incubation after treatment with 0.28, 2.8 and 5.6 nM S protein showed a dose dependent increase in IL-8 production compared to control cultures at all time periods. PBMC treated with S protein at 5.6 nM produced significantly more IL-8 compared to controls. This corresponded to 132% (p = .0027) at 3 h, 107% (p = .037) at 6 h and 84% (p = .043) at 9 h. Lower concentrations of S did not significantly affect IL-8 production. At 2.8 nM S protein the increase was 77, 59 and 47% and at 0.28 nM S protein the increase was 19, 14 and 3% at 3, 6 and 9 h respectively. Our kinetic studies performed at 3, 6 and 9 h of incubation showed significant IL-8 production by PBMC in an S protein concentration dependent manner.\n\nE protein is similar to S protein in that it is an envelope protein expressed on the surface of virions and infected cells. We compared the effects of S and E protein treatments on IL-8 mRNA abundance in PBMC. In vitro PBMC were treated with various concentrations of E and S proteins for 24 h and RNA was extracted, reverse transcribed and cDNA amplified by qPCR using primers specific for the housekeeping gene \u2424-Actin and IL-8. Data presented in Fig. 4A show the relative expression (TAI values) of IL-8 in S versus E treated cultures. As expected, S protein increased IL-8 mRNA abundance in a dose dependent manner as follows: 1.9-fold at 0.28 nM S, 2.04-fold at 2.8 nM S, 7.89-fold at 5.6 nM S and 22.01-fold at 28 nM S. On the other hand, treatment with E protein did not increase IL-8 mRNA abundance as follows: 1.06-fold at 0.5 nM E, 0.08-fold at 2.5 nM E and 0.85-fold at 25 nM E as compared to control. Our results indicated that treatment with S protein increased IL-8 mRNA, while E protein did not increase IL-8 mRNA in PBMC.\n\nThe synthesis and secretion of IL-8 by S protein-and E proteintreated PBMC (from Section 3.4 above) was quantitated by ELISA Fig. 4 . S protein but not E protein treatment increased IL-8 mRNA abundance and IL-8 production and secretion in PBMC. In vitro PBMC (2 \u00d7 10 5 cells) were treated with S protein (0.28, 2.8, 5.6 and 28 nM) or E protein (0.5, 2.5 and 25 nM) for 24 h. (A) RNA was extracted, reverse transcribed, cDNA amplified and IL-8 gene expression was determined by real-time quantitative PCR. Relative expression of mRNA species was calculated using the comparative CT method. Statistical significance was determined using the student's t-test based on comparison with the mock-treated control for each dose. Significant differences in IL-8 mRNA abundance were observed when the PBMC were treated with S protein \u22655.6 nM compared to control (p = 0.047, data of three separate experiments) while E protein did not increase IL-8 mRNA levels. (B) Secreted IL-8 concentrations at 24 h following S protein and E protein treatment of PBMC were determined by ELISA. IL-8 concentration increased in S protein-treated PBMC in proportion to mRNA abundance whereas secreted IL-8 did not increase in E protein-treated PBMC, compared to control. assay of the supernatant medium after 24 h of incubation. PBMC treated with S protein produced more IL-8 in a dose dependent manner as follows 2049 pg/ml (12% increase) at 0.28 nM S, 2782 pg/ml (52% increase) at 2.8 nM S, 6340 pg/ml (246% increase) at 5.6 nM S, 12,774 pg/ml (598% increase) at 28 nM S as compared to the control, 1829 pg/ml, without S protein. PBMC treated with E protein produced less IL-8 as follows; 885 pg/ml (19% less) at 0.5 nM E, 823 pg/ml (21% less) at 2.5 nM E, 736 pg/ml (30% less) at 25 nM E as compared to the control, 1045 pg/ml, without E protein Fig. 4B . Our results indicated that S protein increased IL-8 secretion in proportion to increased mRNA abundance, while E protein did not increase IL-8 secretion in PBMC.\n\nWe next determined whether IL-8 production was dependent on NF-B, which is activated through IB\u2423 proteolysis. In order to inhibit NF-B activation, we examined the effect of pretreatment of cells with TPCK, an NF-B inhibitor that inhibits IB\u2423 protease (Henkel et al., 1993) . PBMC cultures (10 4 -10 5 cells) or THP-1 cultures (10 6 cells) were pretreated with 25 M TPCK for 20 min, followed by S protein treatment and incubation in the presence of TPCK for 24 h. Treated with S protein alone, TPCK alone or mock-treated served as controls. Production and secretion of IL-8 into the supernatant medium was measured by ELISA. Our results showed that in PBMC, S protein alone increased IL-8 significantly (1714 \u00b1 432 pg/ml versus control 275 \u00b1 330 pg/ml, p = 0.0005) whereas pretreatment of PBMC with TPCK significantly reduced the amount of IL-8 produced in response to S protein (1714 \u00b1 432 pg/ml versus S protein with inhibitor, 94 \u00b1 157 pg/ml, p = 0.024, 95% inhibition). In mock-treated PBMC with inhibitor 66 \u00b1 113 pg/ml of secreted IL-8 was produced Fig. 5A . Similarly, in THP-1 cells, S protein alone increased IL-8 significantly (1403 \u00b1 79 pg/ml versus control 863 \u00b1 48 pg/ml, p = 0.017) whereas pretreatment with TPCK significantly reduced the amount of IL-8 produced in response to S protein (1403 \u00b1 79 pg/ml versus S protein with inhibitor, 3.4 \u00b1 3.2 pg/ml). In mock-treated THP-1 cells with inhibitor <1.5 pg/ml of IL-8 was produced Fig. 5B . Next, the effect of TPCK inhibitor on IL-8 secretion in HCoV-229E-infected PBMC was measured during one cycle of virus replication (8 h post-infection).\n\nTPCK only partially inhibited the secretion of IL-8 and the effect was not seen until 6 h after infection suggesting that post-entry events were involved Fig. 5C . TPCK toxicity for virus-infected cells was measured by plaque assay. HCoV-229E yield was 38% lower in PBMC cultures in the presence of 25 M TPCK. Virus titer with TPCK was 4.7 log10 versus 5.13 log10 pfu/ml without TPCK at 8 h post-infection. Our results indicated that NF-B activation was required for production and secretion of IL-8 in response to treatment of PBMC or THP-1 cells with S protein. However, TPCK treatment was not sufficient to completely inhibit IL-8 production and secretion in PBMC infected with HCoV-229E at MOI of 1.\n\nIn order to determine the effect of S protein treatment on nuclear NF-B activity, we measured the amount of active NF-B p65 transcription factor in the nucleus using an assay that measures the amount of NF-B p65 that binds to its consensus sequence immobilized on wells of a 96-well plate. Nuclear fractions of PBMC treated with S protein showed higher levels NF-B p65 DNA binding activity than mock-treated controls. Activity levels in PBMC at 6 h posttreatment were: S protein 23,585 \u00b1 13,414 (luminescence units per g nuclear protein) versus control 6968 \u00b1 3490 (238% increase, p = 0.018), at 9 h post-treatment S protein 19,880 \u00b1 4694 (luminescence units per g nuclear protein) versus control 6725 \u00b1 2680 (151% increase, p = 0.0007), at 18 h post-treatment S protein 37,476 \u00b1 10,416 (luminescence units per g nuclear protein) versus controls 11,500 \u00b1 6600 (226% increase, (p = 0.15, ns) Fig. 6A . When adherent THP-1 cells were analyzed, activity levels at Fig. 6 . Quantitation of the effect of S protein on the activation of NF-B. Nuclear proteins were extracted from PBMC or THP-1 cells treated with S protein (11.2 nM) or mock-treated (control). To assay for activated NF-B, 1 g of the nuclear extract was added per well coated with NF-B consensus DNA sequence and the amount of active NF-B p65 bound after 1 h incubation was measured as luminescence units using EZ Detect NF-B p65 Transcription Factor Assay. Each bar represents luminescence activity per g nuclear extract (mean \u00b1 S.E from three independent experiments). The results show that in (A) PBMC and (B) THP-1 cells, treatment with S protein increased NF-B activity compared to controls. In THP-1 cells, TPCK pretreatment reduced NF-B binding activity in response to S protein by 62% (p = 0.04) at 1 h posttreatment and by 77% (p = 0.008) at 4 h post-treatment with S protein.\n\n1 h post-treatment were: S protein 73,382 \u00b1 2383 (luminescence units per g nuclear protein) versus control 41,961 \u00b1 7516 (75% increase, p = 0.0005), at 4 h post-treatment, S protein 55,339 \u00b1 1666 (luminescence units per g nuclear protein) versus control 33,487 \u00b1 5535 (65% increase, p = 0.004) Fig. 6B . In THP-1 cells, TPCK pretreatment reduced the NF-B promoter binding activity response to S protein. Our results showed that NF-B promoter activity increased in PBMC and THP-1 cells treated with S protein and that TPCK pretreatment could reduce the response.\n\nWe next examined whether toll-like receptors that are present on human macrophages could interact with S protein to induce IL-8 secretion. Using 293 cells stably expressing human TLR2, we found that hTLR2 expression was sufficient to allow for IL-8 production in response to S protein (573 \u00b1 194 pg/ml versus control 218 \u00b1 154 pg/ml, p = 0.03) Fig. 7A . 293 cells did not show an IL-8 response to S protein Fig. 7B . This was an important observation given that TLR2 can be activated by several viruses or viral components and is predominantly expressed on macrophages in humans (Finberg et al., 2007) . hACE2-293 cells did not show an IL-8 response to S protein whereas SARS pseudovirus stimulated low levels of IL-8 (42 \u00b1 13 pg/ml) possibly through hACE2 signaling Fig. 7C . In 293 cells, pSARS pHIV cotransfection results in S protein synthesis and secretion of SARS pseudovirus. When supernantant medium from these cotransfected cells was examined, a low level of IL-8 secretion (69 \u00b1 8.5 pg/ml) was found Fig. 7B . In these cotransfected cells, S protein expression could be involved in stimulating IL-8 production. In HCoV-229E-infected hTLR2-293 cells and 293cells, production and secretion of IL-8 was detected but activation was not TLR2-specific Fig. 7A and B. Our results show that SARS S protein in a soluble form increased IL-8 production through hTLR2 ligand interaction.\n\nDuring the SARS-CoV respiratory syndrome, numerous cytokine and chemokines are induced that attract specialized immune cells to the sites of infection (He et al., 2006 ). An adaptive immune response is initiated that resolves the infection (Cameron et al., 2007) . Elevated cytokine and immune regulatory gene expression was found in PBMC of patients with SARS (Yu et al., 2005) . In good agreement with their observations we showed that mRNA abundance of IL-6 and IL-8 cytokines was elevated, as well as CXCL10 ligand (in convalescence). Elevated CXCL10 mRNA contributes to resolution of the infection with neuroadaptive mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in mouse brain (Walsh et al., 2008) .\n\nWe showed that treatment of PBMC with S protein (11.2 nM) leads to their activation as indicated by the production and secretion of several inflammatory mediators. The increase in secreted IL-8, MIP-1\u2424 (CCL4), IL-6 and IL-1\u2424 was statistically significant as detected by ELISA assay. By microaray analysis, IL-8, IL-6 and IL-1\u2424 mRNA abundance also increased but MIP-1\u2424 mRNA did not increase appreciably.\n\nTo study IL-8 chemokine induction in more detail, PBMC were treated with S protein at various concentrations, and production and secretion of IL-8 over a 24 h period was determined by ELISA. IL-8 levels increased significantly at 3 h post-treatment with S protein at a concentration of 5.6 nM compared to mock-treated controls. This concentration is higher than the levels of binding of S to other functional molecules. ACE2 receptor binds S specifically with 1.7 nM affinity (Li et al., 2003b) . A highly potent neutralizing monoclonal antibody bound to S and inhibited fusion at 0.32 nM (Sui et al., 2004) .\n\nPBMC carry out steady state production of IL-8 from basal levels of IL-8 mRNA since it is also involved in other cellular processes. We found highly variable basal IL-8 levels between different individuals. However, after S protein treatment IL-8 levels were highly elevated. Similarly, Huang et al. (2006) found that in acute phase SARS patient sera, levels of IL-8 were highly variable but were significantly different from healthy controls. In genetic studies, differential expression between the IL8 promoter variant alleles showed significant association (p < 0.001) with cystic fibrosis lung disease severity (Hillian et al., 2008) . Our results showed that S protein at concentrations 5.6 nM significantly increased IL-8 mRNA abundance in PBMC. IL-8 production and secretion could be enhanced in PBMC by more than one mechanism including direct activation by S protein and indirect priming via IL-8 receptor which was shown to be increased in SARS patients (Yu et al., 2005) . Secreted spike could be produced during virus infection (Pulford and Britton, 1991) .\n\nWe showed that recombinant E protein did not increase IL-8 mRNA abundance. Previously, Versteeg et al. (2007) showed that E and M structural proteins expressed from vaccinia virus in L cells did not induce CXCL2, the mouse counterpart of IL-8. The SARS E protein is of interest because it is found on the cell surface late in infection and it traverses the lipid bilayer with its N-terminal portion protruding and detectable with E-specific antibody (Maeda et al., 2001) .\n\nSince the SARS syndrome is characterized by an uncontrolled inflammatory response and NF-B is the major transcription factor activated in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Fan et al., 2001) , we sought to determine whether S protein-induced IL-8 production is mediated by NF-B activation. We examined the activity of the NF-B inhibitor, TPCK. This NF-B inhibitor acts by inhibiting IKB\u2423 protease so that IKB\u2423 is not proteolytically degraded and NF-B is not released to undergo nuclear translocation (Henkel et al., 1993) . We observed that the addition of TPCK before treatment with S protein significantly inhibited IL-8 secretion suggesting that NF-B activation was required for S protein-induced IL-8 secretion. TPCK partially inhibited IL-8 secretion in HCoV-229E-infected PBMC and also reduced the virus yield. These effects on HCoV-229Einfected PBMC could be due to inhibition of proteases and possibly to induction of apoptosis (Zhu et al., 1997) . HCoV-229E spike resembles SARS-CoV spike. Both SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E spikes do not contain furin recognition sites and are uncleaved in the virion . Cathepsin L cleavage separates the receptor-binding subunit (S1) from the membrane anchored fusion subunit . Both viruses use clathrin-mediated endocytosis for ACE2 or CD13 (human aminopeptidase N) receptor mediated entry (Yeager et al., 1992; Inoue et al., 2007) . Inhibitors of cathepsin L, a cysteine protease, block cell fusion and entry via endocytosis for both viruses (Bosch et al., 2008; Li et al., 2006; Kawase et al., 2009) . TPCK is an inhibitor of chymotrypsin-like serine proteases and prevents MHV spike cleavage in L2 cells (Mizzen et al., 1986) . This class of inhibitors did not block SARS S1 cleavage from the spike trimer . However, Factor Xa, a membrane bound protease, could cleave SARS S protein into functional S1 and S2 subunits and Ben-HCl, an inhibitor of trypsin and serine proteases, inhibited cleavage and effectively blocked viral entry (Du et al., 2007) . Thus, in addition to NF-B inhibition, TPCK might prevent S protein cleavage. Further work is necessary to address this issue.\n\nTo verify that nuclear NF-B activity increased in S proteintreated PBMC, we performed direct measurement of active NF-B transcription factor binding to consensus DNA sequences. We found a significant increase in nuclear NF-B p65 transcription factor activity in S protein-treated PBMC and THP-1 cells compared to mock treatment. This indicated that S protein caused a specific activation of NF-B signaling. Chang et al. (2004) suggested that in hACE2 receptor positive lung epithelial and fibroblast cells, SARS S1 protein induced IL-8 via AP-1 activator through hACE2 signaling. We found that TLR2 expression was sufficient to allow for IL-8 production in response to S protein. TLR2, like all TLRs, activates a common signaling pathway that culminates in the activation of NF-B ( Barton and Medzhitov, 2003) . TLR2 is predominantly expressed at high levels on macrophages in humans and can be activated by several viruses or viral components (Finberg et al., 2007) . Plasmacytoid cells use the TLR pathway for viral defense (Barton and Medzhitov, 2003) . Other cells use cytosolic RNA receptors RIG1-like helicases (RLHs) and MDA-5 (Uematsu and Akria, 2007) and nucleic acid recognizing TLRs 3,7,8 and 9 that are critical in the regulation of the production of type 1 IFNs in response to virus infection (Finberg et al., 2007) . TLR2 is not an IFN\u2424 inducer (Barton and Medzhitov, 2003) . IFN\u2424 mRNA did not increase in S protein-treated PBMC in our experiments (data not shown). TLR2 mRNA was shown to be increased in PBMC from acute phase SARS patients (Reghunathan et al., 2005) . Further work is underway to confirm our observations.\n\nIn conclusion, we have provided evidence that S protein induces IL-8 in PBMC in vitro and in THP-1 cells. Others have shown this for lung epithelial cells and fibroblasts . S protein induction was dose dependent. A dose of 5.6 nM per 2 \u00d7 10 5 PBMC increased IL-8 secretion significantly compared to mock-treated controls. The ability of S protein to increase IL-8 mRNA was mediated by activation of NF-B possibly via TLR2 ligand and could be inhibited by the NF-B inhibitor TPCK. The ability to detect elevated NF-B transcription factor activity in the nucleus in response to S protein suggests that this most likely occurs by the mechanism of induction. Moreover increased secretion of IL-8 and IL-6 cytokines indicated that levels of proinflammatory mediators could be enhanced by S protein interaction with monocyte macrophages and could stimulate NK, neutrophil and monocyte migration to the site of infection."}
