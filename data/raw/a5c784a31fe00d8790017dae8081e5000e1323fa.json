C-score, raw cleavage site score; Sscore, signal peptide score; Y-score, combined cleavage site score. For non-secreted proteins, all scores should be close to negative target value of 0. \n\nSupplementary Figure 7 . Failure to rescue a viral mutant that overcomes IFI6. YFV was serially passaged every 2 days in Huh7.5 cells stably transduced with lentivirus expressing IFI6 or an empty vector. Supernatants were assayed for virus production by plaque assay on BHK-21 J cells. Blot was cut at indicated line. Upper half was probed with anti-BiP antibody, lower half was probed with anti-IFI6 antibody and exposed together. A short exposure was chosen for BiP (right), and a long exposure was chosen for IFI6 (left). Upper half was reprobed with anti-actin antibody (bottom). Lanes 1-3 not used in figure. Blot was cut at indicated line. Upper half was probed with anti-BiP antibody, lower half was probed with anti-IFI6 antibody and exposed together. A short exposure was chosen for BiP (right), and a long exposure was chosen for IFI6 (long). Upper half was reprobed with anti-actin antibody (bottom). Lanes 1-3 not used in figure. Blot was cut at indicated line. Upper half was probed with HSPA5, lower half was probed with IFI6 and exposed together. A short exposure was chosen for BiP(right), and a long exposure was chosen for IFI6 (left). Upper half was reprobed for actin (bottom). \n\nThe human \"Brunello\" CRISPR knockout pooled library was purchased (#73179, addgene.org) and amplified according to instructions. The amplified pooled plasmid library was used to make infectious lentivirus from 293T cells. The day before transfection, 293T cells were seeded into twenty polylysine-coated 15 cm plates at a density of 6x10 6 cells per plate. The day of transfection, the culture media was exchanged for 15mL DMEM supplemented with 3% FBS, 1X NEAA, and Pen-Strep, and pooled library plasmid was then co-transfected with lentiviral packaging plasmids expressing Gag-Pol and VSV-g at a ratio of 5 at 55\u00b0C while shaking at 550rpm on a Thermomixer (Eppendorf). The following day, 5\u00b5l of 2 mg/ml RNase A was added to each tube and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h while shaking at 550rpm. Extractions were collected after mixing samples with an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) twice, followed once by chloroform; each extraction was separated using MaXtract high density phase lock tubes (Qiagen). Twenty micrograms of glycoblue (Roche) and 1mL of 100% ethanol were added to each sample and DNA was precipitated at \u221220\u00b0C for 1h followed by centrifugation at 18,000g\n\nfor 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Pellets were washed with 1mL of 75% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 50\u00b5L of water by incubating at 4\u00b0C overnight. Uninfected cell pellets of transduced cells were lysed and gDNA was extracted for controls. To amplify sgRNA sequences for Next Gen Sequencing, four parallel 100\u00b5l PCR reactions were run for each condition, and pooled. Each 100\u00b5l PCR reaction contained 6-10\u00b5g of gDNA, Ex Taq polymerase, pooled P5 and barcoded P7 primers (listed in supplementary table 1) as previously described 42 . DNA was purified for sequencing using AMPure XP beads (Agencourt) by mixing 300\u00b5l of pooled PCR with 150\u00b5l beads and incubated for 5 minutes to pre-clear genomic DNA.\n\nMagnetic separation was used to collect the supernatant. The supernatant was then mixed with 540\u00b5l of AMPure XP beads and incubated for 5 minutes to bind the PCR products. The supernatant was collected and discarded. Beads were washed twice with 1mL 70% ethanol and then dried for approximately 5 minutes. Bound DNA was eluted from the beads using 300\u00b5l sterile water. Before sequencing, all PCR DNA libraries were analyzed using a Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Analysis Kit (Agilent). Library concentration was determined by qPCR using a KAPA Library Quantification Kit for Illumina platforms.\n\nThe samples were sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 500 with the read configuration as 75bp, single end.\n\nEach sample got approximately 10 million to 15 million reads. An in-house script was used to trim the adapter sequences from raw de-multiplexed FASTQ files and unique 20bp sgRNA sequences were processed for further downstream analysis. The reference sgRNA sequences for the human Brunello library were downloaded from Addgene (https://www.addgene.org/pooled-library/ ). Identical sgRNAs targeting the same protein coding genes were removed from the reference library. Software MAGeCK (v0.5.1) was used for data analysis. Sample reads were mapped to the reference sgRNA library with mismatch option as 0. Median normalization was performed to adjust for library sizes and read counts.\n\nPositively and negatively selected sgRNA and genes were identified with default parameters."}
