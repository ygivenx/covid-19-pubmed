{"title": "TITLE: Pulmonary Metagenomic Sequencing Suggests Missed Infections in Immunocompromised AFFILIATIONS", "body": "Last year in the United States, approximately 15,000 children were diagnosed with cancer, 2,000 children underwent solid organ transplantation (SOT), and 2,500 children underwent hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for an increasingly broad set of life-threatening diseases (1) (2) (3) . While significant progress has been made in improving the safety of anti-neoplastic and transplantation-based therapies, the risk of infectious complications remains high (4) . In particular, lower respiratory tract infections in children who have undergone HCT are associated with mortality rates exceeding 45% (5, 6) . Current microbiologic diagnostics are inadequate and fail to identify a pathogenic organism in over one third of such cases (7) .\n\nAutopsy case series have identified previously undetected pulmonary pathogens in 30-50% of pediatric HCT patients, underscoring current diagnostic limitations and the significant mortality associated with undiagnosed pulmonary infections in such patients (8) .\n\nRecent advances in metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) have shown promising results in diagnosing neurologic, ocular, and other infections (9) (10) (11) . However, the identification of fastidious pathogens such as Aspergillus and other filamentous molds remain difficult due to thick extracellular matrices and the relatively small inoculum required to induce disease (12) (13) (14) (15) . Unfortunately, off-the-shelf assays for respiratory biospecimens have proven inadequate to survey the variety of organisms present in thick and mucoid respiratory secretions. As such, unlike the better-characterized microbiomes of the human gastrointestinal tract and nasopharynx, data describing the composition of the pulmonary microbiome are sparse and insufficient to reliably discriminate between health and disease (16) . Therefore, we conducted a pilot study aimed to (1) develop and optimize a highly sensitive mNGS assay capable of detecting pulmonary bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens clinically relevant to immunocompromised children, and (2) test this mNGS assay on a cohort of immunocompromised children undergoing lower respiratory tract sampling as evaluation for suspected pulmonary infection. We hypothesized that an optimized mNGS assay could improve characterization of the pulmonary microbiome and aid in the identification of potential pulmonary pathogens in this high-risk population.\n\n.

Given the challenges of diagnosing pulmonary infections, we created a set of mock-positive BALs by spiking a pre-determined number of colony forming units (CFUs) of an Aspergillus niger clinical isolate into aliquots of BAL with a previously identified Haemophilus influenzae/Human Adenovirus B co-infection (Supplemental Text 1).\n\nAspergillus was chosen as an optimization benchmark given its thick polysaccharide cell wall and extreme clinical importance in this patient population. Bioinformatics Pipeline: Resultant .fastq files were processed using a previously described pipeline\n\nconsisting of several open-source components (9, 10) . Briefly, reads underwent iterative removal of host (Hg38/PanTro), low quality, low complexity (LZW compression ratio >0.45), and redundant sequences using STAR, Bowtie2, PriceSeqFilter, and CD-HIT-DUP (18) (19) (20) (21) .

Microbes were described as potentially pathogenic or typically nonpathogenic based on a priori literature review (Supplemental Text 4).\n\nTo avoid spurious alignments and sequencing artifacts, we only included read pairs where both ends aligned to the same taxonomic ID. The prevalence of each microbe was described (1) relative to other microbes in the same sample, wherein we normalized sequencing reads per million total sequencing reads (rpm); and (2) relative to the same microbe in other samples in the cohort, wherein we normalized sequencing reads as the number of standard deviations above or below the mean log10-transformed rpm for the total cohort (Z-score) (23) . Outliers were defined as microbes with RNA alignments that were both abundant within a sample (\u226510% of all bacterial reads in a sample, or >1 rpm for fungi and viruses) and \u22652 standard deviations above the cohort mean for that particular microbe (Z-score \u22652). A subset of outliers were confirmed via orthogonal assays. The Simpson's Diversity Index was used to associate the loss of bacterial diversity with the presence of outlier microbes (detailed methods in Supplemental Text 5) (24) .\n\nSequencing reads are deposited in the NCBI dbGaP (BioProject ID PRJNA437169).\n\nTo test the optimized mNGS assay, we prospectively collected 41 lower respiratory samples from The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Aspergillus. In comparison, the optimized DNA sequencing assay was able to detect as few as 6.13\n\nAspergillus CFU (95% CI 4.16-9.04), suggesting RNAseq to be approximately 10-fold more sensitive than DNAseq for detecting Aspergillus nucleic acid in respiratory specimens (paired T-test p<0.001, Figure 1 ).\n\nThe optimization did not change the detection of H.influenzae or Human Adenovirus B (T-test p=0.343 and p=0.420, respectively). These results suggest that only the optimized RNAseq protocol had a sufficiently dynamic range to detect Aspergillus nucleic acid in quantities analogous to rare growth in culture.\n\nWe enrolled 34 patients and collected 41 lower respiratory samples for this pilot project ( Table 1) . Using the optimized extraction protocol described above, we conducted mNGS resulting in 21.2 \u00b14.2 million reads per sample. After quality filtering and removal of human reads, the remaining reads aligning to bacteria, fungi, and viruses were analyzed further as discussed below. Detailed reports for each patient exist in Appendix 1.\n\n.

It Fungi: Relative to bacterial alignments, fungal alignments were significantly less prevalent in the cohort.\n\n92.1% of fungal genera were detected at less than a single read per million reads mapped (Figure 2b) .\n\nApproximately half of all identified fungal genera were of low abundance and were present at levels similar to other samples in the cohort (50.6%); an additional 41.5% were of low abundance but were rare in the cohort. Evidence supporting these alignments is limited by the rarity of the reads themselves. Only 3.4% of fungal genera were both abundant and had a Z-score \u22652. These outliers included 7 potentially pathogenic .

Aspergillus RNA levels correlated with \u22651 CFU in 14/41 samples, suggesting that the lower airways of immunocompromised children are frequently exposed to quantities of Aspergillus RNA consistent with low numbers of CFUs. Of these 14 samples, one patient sample was positive for IPA by both culture and galactomannan assay (Figure 2b, labeled) . Although the remaining 13 were all culturenegative, 12/13 had received fungicidal or fungistatic anti-Aspergillus pharmacotherapy within 48 hours of sample collection, suggesting that empiric antifungal pharmacotherapy significantly confounds the association between Aspergillus RNA and growth in culture. While Aspergillus RNA sequencing reads did not correlate with growth in culture (T-test p=0.148), they did correlate with BAL galactomannan The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Additionally, two patients had viral co-infections (Parainfluenza-3 and Influenza-C;\n\nApproximately half of viral genera were detected below 1 read per million sequencing reads (50.9%).

All validation tests were concordant with mNGS with one exception: 28S/ITS amplicon DNA sequencing failed to identify C.glabrata in Sample 37. For this sample, we confirmed the presence of this organism with 3 separate species-specific RT-PCR primer sets followed by Sanger sequencing in-house, confirming the initial mNGS report of C.glabrata. As there are numerous complementary bioinformatics approaches for analyzing metagenomic datasets, we tested the reproducibility of our approach by reanalyzing our data using a parallel method developed in-house that weights organisms by both abundance and concordance of paired RNA and DNA sequencing reads without Z-scores (Supplemental Table 1 ).\n\nThe results of this analytical approach and our primary analytical approach showed strong agreement. In sum, these data demonstrate that mNGS has significantly greater sensitivity for detecting potential pulmonary pathogens than current clinical diagnostics (McNemar's p<0.001).\n\nIn this study, we developed an optimized mNGS assay with adequate sensitivity to identify bacteria, fungi, and both RNA and DNA viruses within the lower respiratory tract of immunocompromised children. In doing so, we identified a rich molecular portrait of the pulmonary microbiome in this vulnerable patient population. Further, by comparing the quantity of microbial nucleic acid to other microbes within a sample and to other samples within the cohort, we were able to identify outlying potential pathogens in approximately half of previously-negative samples.\n\nDue to inherent challenges in sampling the lower respiratory tract, the pulmonary microbiome was not one of the original sites sampled in the 2008 Human Microbiome Project and data regarding pulmonary microbial communities in health and disease have lagged decades behind similar analyses of human intestinal, cutaneous, and nasopharyngeal microbiomes (27) . In this study, we detected that many pathogenic bacteria such as Pseudomonas and Streptococcus are ubiquitous and hence their abundance The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/291864 doi: bioRxiv preprint needs to be contextualized by cohort-specific norms. By using cohort-specific Z-scores, we provide a template for discriminating normal from abnormal microbial burden in the lungs of immunocompromised children. For example, 100% of samples had detectable Pseudomonas RNA, but only Sample 29 had detectable Pseudomonas RNA more than 2 standard deviations above the cohort mean (Appendix 1).\n\nWhile prior metagenomic sequencing assays for human biospecimens have demonstrated excellent detection of viral and bacterial nucleic acid, they have lacked sensitivity for detecting fastidious organisms such as filamentous mold (12, 13) . This study confirms the need for aggressive mechanical homogenization in stabilizing media in order to detect molds such as Aspergillus while simultaneously preserving the detection of bacteria and viruses (25) . Despite this, transcripts aligning to fungi remained significantly less ubiquitous than transcripts aligning to bacteria, perhaps due to relative organism abundance. Although the majority of commercial sequencing assays use DNA, our data demonstrate that RNA sequencing is >10 times as sensitive as DNA sequencing for the detection of such fastidious organisms, which we speculate may be due to high transcriptional activity of regions such as rRNA genes in active organisms (26) .\n\nSurprisingly, Aspergillus RNA equivalent to \u22651 CFU was detected in 34.1% of samples and no water controls, suggesting that the lungs of immunocompromised children are frequently exposed to low levels of Aspergillus. The 100-fold increase in Aspergillus nucleic acid after optimized mechanical homogenization suggests that the origin of the Aspergillus RNA is likely from intact fungal organisms in the lower respiratory tract of immunocompromised children, rather than from migration of extracellular nucleic acid down the respiratory tree. However, as only 10% of samples originated from patients with suspected IPA, we speculate that patient-specific factors such as immune reconstitution, alloreactive inflammation, and impaired mucociliary clearance are as important as inoculum exposure in determining which child might develop IPA (28) . Although Aspergillus growth in culture appeared to be confounded by the frequent use of prophylactic and empiric antifungals, the quantity of Aspergillus sequencing reads was correlated with BAL galactomannan (29, 30) . As nutrient availability and the kinetics of Aspergillus growth may affect both galactomannan release and bioavailability of Aspergillus nucleic acid, we advocate .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/291864 doi: bioRxiv preprint that RNA/DNA-based assays might complement but should not replace antigen-based assays in the diagnosis of IPA (31, 32) . While our mNGS assay was highly sensitive for Aspergillus detection, specificity for differentiating infection from colonization was limited; future studies pairing mNGS with host susceptibility and immune function may improve discrimination of colonization and invasive mycosis (33) (34) (35) (36) .\n\nConsistent with emerging data in pediatrics, this work also detected herpesviruses such as CMV and HHV-6 in low abundance across many children in the cohort (37, 38) . Interestingly, a number of typically nonpathogenic viruses such as Torquetenovirus and KI Polyomavirus were present in over half the cohort.\n\nWhile data supporting the direct pathogenicity of these viruses are lacking, they may be a marker of immune function and a predictor of post-transplant infectious and alloimmune complications, including lung injury in general (39) (40) (41) . Future studies aimed at characterizing longitudinal changes in the pulmonary virome of immunocompromised children are warranted.\n\nBy characterizing the distribution of pulmonary microbes within the cohort, we were able to identify statistically outlying potential pathogens in half of previously negative samples. Most cultivable bacteria and fungi that were not detected clinically were isolated from patients who had already received antimicrobial therapies, highlighting the importance of culture-independent techniques (16) . In addition, several pathogenic viruses were not detected clinically due to omission from multiplex PCR assays (Human coronavirus, Human bocavirus, Influenzavirus-C) (42, 43) . Unfortunately, a number of pathogens detected by mNGS currently lack targeted therapeutics, and as such, the development of pharmacologic and cellbased therapies remains a priority in this field (44) (45) (46) . In addition, while this study suggests that many The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

First, we optimized the identification of Aspergillus RNA and contextualized Aspergillus sequencing reads by comparing with both growth in culture and BAL galactomannan. Second, we proposed a logical analytical framework that ranks organism abundance both within a sample and relative to other samples; this framework allowed us to rapidly exclude more than 95% of identified bacteria. Third, we provide, to our knowledge, the first evaluation of the pulmonary microbiome in immunocompromised children.\n\nThis pilot study has several limitations. First, while using standard Z-scores was useful in de-emphasizing commonly abundant organisms (ie: S.pneumoniae), it may have overvalued uncommon pathogens with less abundant transcripts (ie: CMV) or undervalued frequently encountered pathogens (ie: Rhinovirus).\n\nAdditional larger studies aimed at quantifying pulmonary microbial communities in immunocompromised children will naturally improve the value of Z-score analysis. Second, as with all mNGS assays, the identification of microbial nucleic acid does not directly confirm the presence of viable, live organisms, does not directly implicate that microbe as a contributor to pulmonary disease, and does not exclude less abundant organisms as potential contributors to pulmonary disease. In order to optimize patient outcomes, we advocate for ongoing multidisciplinary collaboration between intensivists, immunologists, oncologists, transplant physicians, infectious disease physicians, pulmonologists, bioinformaticians, and basic scientists.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/291864 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nIn summary, we present a mNGS assay optimized to evaluate the pulmonary microbiome and detect potential pathogens in immunocompromised children. This assay is highly sensitive, reveals a rich bacterial, fungal, and viral pulmonary microbiome, and further identified potential pathogens in half of previously negative samples. As such, advanced organism detection offers the potential for early implementation of targeted therapy and the possibility for improved clinical outcomes in immunocompromised children. We invite the scientific and clinical community to participate in an ongoing multicenter collaborative clinical trial aimed at further refining this emerging technology (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02926612).\n\n.
