{"title": "Clinical Signs", "body": "1. Thorough laboratory profile and neurologic examination to assess the presence of pain or underlying organic disease (such as brain tumor). 2. The most effective plan for diagnosis and therapy may be for the clinician to make the owners aware of the clinical signs of aggression, alert them to the usual sequelae of early patterns, and direct them to a behavior specialist. 3. NOTE: Administration of a psychotropic drug as empiric therapy for aggression is not recommended before determining a possible cause and attempting to modify behavior through training. Denotes the presence of blood in the urine; the presence of trace amounts of blood in the urine will not be obvious on gross appearance of a urine sample. Therefore, any noticeable change in the color of urine observed by the owner is likely to be interpreted as \"blood in the urine.\" Further evaluation of the patient is necessary to determine whether or not the discoloration is associated with small blood clots in recently voided urine, bloodtinged urine, or brown or red urine. The presence of blood in the urine, whether gross or occult, is most often indicative of upper or lower urinary tract bleeding, although systemic coagulopathies and reproductive tract disorders may also cause hematuria. The presence of hemoglobin in urine (hemoglobinuria) is not necessarily a reflection of urinary tract disease.\n\nSystemic disorders (e.g., those leading to intravascular hemolysis) can be associated with significant hemoglobinuria in the presence of a normal urinary system. Owners are likely to interpret this clinical sign to be \"blood in the urine.\" In true hemoglobinuria, without hematuria, microscopic examination will reveal the absence of red blood cells (RBCs). Distinguishing hemoglobinuria from hematuria is an important diagnostic consideration. Conventional urine test strips (dipsticks) do not differentiate between the two; therefore, microscopic examination of urine sediment for the presence of significant numbers of RBCs is critical.\n\nMyoglobinuria is characterized by brown to dark-red urine, the absence of RBCs in the urine sediment, and a positive test for occult blood. Bilirubinuria can also cause darkbrown to dark-orange urine but alone will not produce a positive test for occult blood. Myoglobinuria is a serious sign and denotes generalized muscle disease.\n\nHematuria associated with the urinary tract may not be associated with any other clinical signs. In patients with significant bleeding of renal origin, evidence of systemic illness may be present but is unlikely to localize the source of hematuria. Hematuria originating from the bladder is more likely to be associated with clinical signs, particularly pollakiuria and dysuria. Reproductive tract disorders (e.g., prostatitis and vaginitis) can also cause significant 394 3 CLINICAL SIGNS\n\nIntracranial neoplasia Cerebral hypoxia Seizure activity Neuroendocrine disturbances\n\nProtective aggression Predatory aggression Fear-induced aggression Intermale and interfemale aggression Pain-induced, punishment-induced, and irritable aggression Maternal aggression Redirected aggression *These behavior patterns are not pathologic states.

Patients with hematuria or hemoglobinuria should be examined carefully for evidence of systemic bleeding, coagulopathies, and neoplasia. (Table 3- 2. If practical, assessment of urethral patency and the patient's ability to urinate. Attempt to pass a urethral catheter if significant dysuria and evidence of lower urinary tract obstructions are present. 3. Complete urinalysis.

Ultrasound examination of the prostate, urinary bladder, and kidneys. 10. Exploratory laparotomy.\n\nComa: A state of complete reversible or irreversible unconsciousness that can result from neurologic as well as non-neurologic disease. Coma can be a consequence of diffuse or multifocal lesions of the cerebrum or a lesion affecting the rostral brain stem and ascending reticular activating system. A variety of organic central nervous system (CNS) disease leading to metabolic or toxic encephalopathy can also produce coma.\n\nDespite the fact that the comatose patient is unconscious, a complete neuro-ophthalmologic examination should be completed. Altered pupil size and pupillary light responses usually indicate brain stem disease. Emergency cardiac assessment of the unconscious patient justifies an electrocardiogram (ECG) and thoracic radiographs. Laboratory assessment of the comatose patient includes hepatic enzymes and, when feasible, hepatic function, electrolytes, and glucose level. 396 3 CLINICAL SIGNS\n\nImmune-mediated hemolytic anemia Transfusion hemolysis Sepsis Red blood cell parasites (e.g., Babesia spp.) Chemical-induced Phenothiazine Acetaminophen Methylene blue Copper Hypo-osmolality\n\nRed blood cell parasites Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia Pyruvate kinase deficiency (basenji and beagle) Congenital porphyria (cats) Hereditary stomatocytosis (malamute) Microangiopathic disease (e.g., hepatic cirrhosis, hemangiosarcoma)\n\nHematuria combined with very dilute urine Hematuria in stored urine DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS (Table 3-2) DIAGNOSTIC PLANS 1. Critical: Assessment of vital signs to evaluate airway, breathing, and circulation (pulse, heartbeat, and ECG). Take thoracic radiographs if indicated. If cerebral edema is suspected, administer ventilation support, intravenous hyperosmotic agents (e.g., mannitol 20%, 1 to 2 g/kg of body weight q6h), and glucocorticoids. 2. Conduct careful neurologic examination directed toward evaluation of brain stem function, including motor function, pupillary light responses (or lack thereof), and eye movement. 3. Comprehensive laboratory profile, to include hematology, biochemical profile, and urinalysis. 4. Special diagnostic tests as appropriate:\n\na. Metabolic coma. Serum ammonia, bile acids, glucose, blood and urine lead levels. b. Neurologic coma. Skull radiographs, cerebral spinal fluid analysis, electroencephalography. c. Assessment of response to IV Mannitol.\n\nThe infrequent or difficult passage of feces. Obstipation: Intractable constipation resulting in fecal impaction through the rectum and possibly the colon. In both dogs and cats, either state is most likely to be acquired.\n\nThe act of straining to defecate or painful defecation, the likely manifestation of constipation or obstipation, typically represents the reason for which a constipated dog or cat is presented (see STRAINING TO DEFECATE: DYSCHEZIA).\n\nThere is no strict definition of bowel regularity; therefore, there is no \"normal\" number of daily or weekly bowel movements, deviations from which constitute constipation.\n\nNon-neurogenic Practically, constipation can be considered to exist when a significant delay in frequency of passing formed stools has been noted or when the stool is observed to be of unusually hard or dry consistency. Constipation is categorized under one of the following headings: Neurogenic; Mechanical (physical); Muscular (smooth muscle); Iatrogenic (druginduced).\n\nThe owner who perceives a pet as straining to defecate may, in fact, be observing a pet that is straining to urinate. This is particularly true among cats with disorders of the lower urinary tract, such as feline urologic syndrome (FUS). In the context of this discussion, dyschezia is discussed only insofar as it is associated with constipation and obstipation (see Figure 3 -2).\n\nAssessment of the patient presented for constipation/obstipation can represent a significant medical challenge due to the complex and varied pathogenic mechanisms involved. Animals with neurogenic causes of constipation may have significant perianal or rectal pain associated with focal lesions. Other patients may present with nonpainful neurologic disease or long-term complications stemming from previous pelvic or spinal trauma.\n\nMechanical causes are either extraluminal or intraluminal. Abdominal and rectal palpation is indicated in both male and female dogs and cats. Narrow or blood-tinged feces may signal the presence of an intraluminal lesion, whereas in patients with extraluminal lesions, associated clinical signs may not be manifested.\n\nMuscular causes are the least common and are generally the result of extreme metabolic aberrations. Idiopathic colonic atony is reported, but constipation may also result from severe catabolic states. Laboratory evidence of endocrine disease and electrolyte abnormalities should be assessed (see p. 630). \n\nCough: A sudden, forceful expiratory response to irritating stimuli (e.g., secretions) situated in the tracheobronchial tree. Cough is the most frequent clinical problem (followed by dyspnea and hemoptysis) that is referable to the lower respiratory tract. At presentation, cough should be characterized as \"acute-onset\" (duration of only a few days) or \"chronic\" (duration \u22651 week). It should be noted that attempting to define cough as productive or nonproductive can be difficult in animals and, furthermore, seems to have little value in the overall diagnostic plan.\n\nAlthough cough is a principal sign of lower respiratory tract disease, particularly lower airway (tracheal and bronchial) disease, it may also occur in animals with nonpulmonary disease, particularly cardiac and intrathoracic diseases. Associated signs, therefore, may include a wide spectrum of findings; there may also be no associated signs. Particular attention should be given to determining the character of the cough: it can be paroxysmal and severe, which usually indicates the need for immediate intervention, or mild but persistent. Animals in need of immediate attention are those with cough associated with syncope, dyspnea, or hemoptysis. Orthopnea, the inability to breathe without assuming a particular (usually upright) position, is a serious sign that suggests compromised respiratory function and also warrants immediate attention. Nasal discharge, tachypnea, and hyperpnea are less commonly associated with cough. Cough can be misinterpreted as vomiting, particularly in dogs with tracheobronchitis. Coughing episodes in affected dogs typically terminate in the expectoration of tracheal secretions. The white, foamy phlegm expelled as the dog retches may appear to the untrained eye as vomitus.\n\n1. History and physical examination. Focus on known breed and age predispositions.\n\nPhysical examination is particularly valuable in determining the extent of respiratory tract involvement and characterizing the type of cough present, particularly when the cough can be elicited by manipulation of the cervical trachea. 2. Careful thoracic auscultation, to determine the presence or absence of murmur or abnormal lung or airway sounds. 3. Thoracic radiographs, using lateral and ventrodorsal projections. These are critical, particularly when the patient has associated signs compatible with respiratory distress. Oxygen should be available to the dyspneic patient throughout the radiographic procedure. Patients with suspected tracheal collapse should be radiographed twice in the lateral position to assess changes in the intrathoracic tracheal and bronchial diameters between inspiration (open) and expiration (closed \n\nHemoptysis is the expectoration, during cough, of blood. Seldom is the volume of blood loss sufficient to cause anemia; however, once confirmed, hemoptysis is a severe clinical finding indicative of bleeding into or from the lower airways. Hemoptysis can be attributed to direct injury of the pulmonary or, less commonly, the tracheobronchial blood vessels, pulmonary hypertension, or coagulopathy. Although an uncommon presenting sign, hemoptysis is more prevalent in dogs than in cats. Since vomiting can be mistaken by the owner for coughing, it becomes essential to differentiate between hemoptysis and hematemesis during the initial examination. Hemoptysis is regarded as an emergency presentation. \n\nBacterial pneumonia Systemic mycoses (e.g., histoplasmosis) Pulmonary neoplasia Pulmonary abscess Protozoan pneumonia (e.g., feline toxoplasmosis) Viral pneumonia Allergic pneumonitis (e.g., feline asthma) Metabolic and endocrine (e.g., hyperadrenocorticism)\n\nLeft heart disease Left heart failure (cardiogenic pulmonary edema)\n\nMediastinal neoplasia\n\nThe most common, and least significant, sign associated with hemoptysis is melena, or dark-red or black discoloration of stool that occurs subsequent to swallowing expectorated blood. More serious associated signs include coughing, hyperpnea, orthopnea, and cyanosis. Apparent episodic weakness and collapse may also be reported.\n\n1. Thorough history and physical examination. In addition, an attempt should be made to determine that the sign for which the patient was presented is, in fact, expectoration of blood during coughing and not bloody vomitus. 2. Routine laboratory profile, to assess the patient's overall health status. Emphasis should be placed on the fecal examination and heartworm tests. Multiple attempts to locate parasite ova in the stool should be made, since lung parasites may be few in number and ova shed intermittently. 3. Thoracic radiographs. 4. Coagulation profile, particularly in those animals with significant bleeding from other sites. 5. Transtracheal aspiration with cytologic studies or bacterial culture and sensitivity tests, or both. 6. Special procedures, including ultrasonography of the lung, particularly when discrete masses are seen on radiographs; echocardiography; blood gas analysis; bronchoscopy; bronchography; and angiography. 7. Radionuclide scans. Although availability is limited, studies may detect areas of pulmonary embolization. \n\nDeafness is the detectable lack or loss, complete or partial, of the sense of hearing. Deafness can result from abnormalities at any one of several levels from the ear to the brain. Peripheral deafness is categorized as either conduction deafness, involving abnormalities of the transduction apparatus (external ear canal, tympanic membrane, auditory ossicles in the middle ear), or nerve deafness, involving the hearing receptors in the cochlea or the auditory branch of the eighth cranial nerve. Congenital deafness is usually nerve deafness and is the result of abnormal development of the spiral organ or auditory receptors in the middle ear. Central hearing loss (intracranial cause) is uncommon, since auditory pathways in the brain are multisynaptic.\n\nLoss of hearing, either partial or complete, in one or both ears does occur in both dogs and cats but is particularly difficult to confirm. Partial loss of hearing occurs most commonly in older animals but is rarely confirmed. Deafness is generally first detected by astute owners who observe diminished or absent responses to noise in an animal with no previous history of hearing difficulty.\n\nAlthough rare, invasive lesions or panencephalitis could conceivably cause central hearing loss. However, the associated neurologic signs would be extensive, and hearing loss becomes a secondary or insignificant clinical issue.\n\nAnimals with peripheral hearing loss due to acquired unilateral lesions may manifest a variety of signs referable to the vestibular apparatus, particularly head tilt and, less often, circling. Pain or increased sensitivity may be associated with invasive lesions affecting hearing in either ear. Physical evidence of otitis externa is readily detected during routine examinations. Severe swelling associated with a chronic inflammation, a ruptured or damaged tympanic membrane, and infections of the middle ear may effectively decrease hearing acuity. Hypothyroidism may also be associated with degeneration of the cochlea and subsequent decrease in hearing acuity. The clinical history is important and should include any prior exposure to drugs known to be toxic to the cochlear nerve and organ of Corti (e.g., aminoglycosides).\n\nCongenital (hereditary) deafness is associated with a white or merle hair coat in both dogs and cats. In dogs, the highest incidence is in the Dalmatian. However, several breeds are reported to be affected.\n\n1. Assessment of response to noise while the animal is relaxed or asleep. 2. Thorough physical examination, particularly of the external ear canal and tympanic membrane. 3. Neurologic examination. 4. Assessment of thyroid hormone levels. \n\nOliguria: Reduced amount of urine production and output in relation to fluid intake. Patients in which urine production ceases have anuria and are considered to be anuric. In contrast to polyuric states, neither oliguria nor anuria is likely to be the primary problem for which a dog or cat is presented to a veterinarian. The metabolic consequences of decreased urine production are severe and generally represent significant compromises in renal blood flow or in the functional status of a critical nephron mass. The daily urine volume at which oliguria begin is a function of solute load and renal concentrating ability. In general, oliguria exists when daily urine production is reduced by 75% or more. Production of 0.5 to 1.0 mL/kg/hr of urine indicates adequate renal perfusion in the dog. Anuria begins or terminates with oliguria; therefore, early detection and treatment of the underlying cause are critical to the overall prognosis.\n\nThe problem(s) for which an oliguric or anuric patient is presented will likely be related to the metabolic consequences of compromised renal function. Uremia, characterized by vomiting, hematemesis, diarrhea, lethargy, or anorexia, predominates. Any one or a combination of signs may present at the time of initial examination. Some patients may present in a comatose or semiconscious state, in which case it is essential that renal function and urinary output be established immediately.\n\nSince acute renal failure (ARF) is the principal differential diagnosis in oliguria and anuria, once it has been established the clinician must obtain a thorough clinical history and laboratory profile, including urinalysis if possible, in an attempt to determine the cause of renal failure and to institute corrective therapy.\n\n1. Initiation of fluid therapy and placement of an indwelling urinary catheter, to establish the rate of urine production. 2. History, to address any possible exposure to toxins, particularly antifreeze, as well as recent drug treatment. 3. Radiographs of the abdomen. These may reveal enlarged kidneys, thereby supporting a diagnosis of ARF. Do not rule out the diagnosis of ARF if kidney size appears normal. Ultrasound imaging of kidneys is also helpful in establishing diagnosis. 4. Complete blood count (CBC). The biochemical profile should include electrolytes as well as blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. Urinalysis (must include urine specific gravity) with microscopic examination of sediment for evidence of crystaluria, RBCs, white blood cells (WBCs), and casts is essential even if only a small volume of urine can be obtained. 5. Blood gases, to assess for metabolic acidosis, which may be severe in ARF. 6. Urine protein-creatinine ratio, to assess proteinuria. 7. If possible, determinations of serum osmolality and serum osmole gap. 8. Special diagnostics: intravenous pyelogram (IVP), renal biopsy, and determinations of lead and other heavy metals in the blood as indicated.\n\nAcute diarrhea: A sudden change in bowel pattern, characterized as increased fluidity, frequency, or volume, that is sustained despite empiric or supportive therapy (see also Diarrhea, chronic). Fundamentally, diarrhea occurs when the amount of water and other intestinal contents reaching the colon exceed the ability of the colon to store the feces and adequately remove the excess water. The pathogenesis of acute diarrhea may be categorized: Osmotic diarrhea: Development of an osmotic gradient in the bowel that favors movement of water into the gut lumen. Disorders of digestion and absorption readily generate such an intraluminal osmotic gradient. In simple osmotic diarrhea, clinical signs should resolve when the patient is fasted and the osmotic gradient equilibrates.\n\nAbnormal gut permeability may be associated with infiltrative disease of the bowel (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease or neoplasia). Inflammatory lesions of the intestine alter mucosal permeability and promote exudation into the gut lumen.\n\nSecretory diarrhea results from the effect of various substances (e.g., enterotoxins, gut hormones) that act as secretagogues. The gut is stimulated to secrete fluids without concurrent changes in permeability, absorptive capacity, motility, or osmotic gradients.\n\nAbnormal bowel motility may occur in several primary disorders of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, but it appears unlikely that abnormal motility is a primary cause of diarrhea. Normally, peristaltic contractions move chyme aborally, whereas segmental activity retards the movement of chyme, thereby performing the important functions of mixing intestinal contents and maximizing contact with the brush border enzyme systems. As segmental contractions are diminished, intestinal contents flow freely through the flaccid gut.\n\nIn the patient with acute diarrhea, it is conceivable that only one of these mechanisms is involved. However, the longer the underlying cause of the diarrhea persists, the more likely that homeostatic and compensatory mechanisms will be overwhelmed. The pathogenesis of the patient's diarrhea is then related to a combination of events.\n\nAcute diarrhea is a common presenting sign for which multitudes of diagnostic possibilities exist. The list of associated signs can be, in the clinical setting, extensive. Among the \n\nmost common signs encountered in an animal presented for acute diarrhea are vomiting, dehydration, slight weight loss, and hematochezia. Abdominal pain, halitosis, flatulence, and borborygmus are other gut-associated signs. However, not all patients with acute diarrhea have primary intestinal disease, such as those with renal or hepatic failure or hypoadrenocorticism. Therefore, icterus, oral ulcers, muscle weakness, and so on may also be encountered. Fever, anorexia, and lethargy may also accompany acute diarrhea in the dog and cat.\n\n1. History and physical examination, including abdominal palpation. Establish possible exposure to infectious agents and associated signs. 2. Intravenous fluids containing NaCl may be a critical part of the early evaluation (signs associated with hypoadrenocorticism or Addison's disease may resolve within minutes to hours) in severely dehydrated patients presented for acute diarrhea. 3. Laboratory profile (to include routine hematology), biochemistry profile (to include amylase or lipase and sodium and potassium), urinalysis, examination of feces (direct and flotation). Perform several examinations before ruling out parasitic disease. Cats should be tested for both FeLV and FIV. Dogs should be tested for parvovirus antigen in stool. 4. Abdominal radiographs. 5. Special diagnostic tests as indicated: abdominal ultrasound; duodenoscopy and mucosal biopsy; stool culture for viruses or bacteria; serologic studies for rickettsial, viral, and fungal disease; and abdominal laparotomy.\n\nIntestinal parasites: nematodes (e.g., ascarids, hookworms, whipworms, Strongyloides spp., Trichinella spp.); protozoa (e.g., coccidian, giardia, Cryptosporidium spp., Pentatrichomas). Bacterial: E. coli. Salmonella spp., Pseudomonas spp., Clostridium spp., Campylobacter spp., Yersinia entercolitica, Staphylococcus spp., Helicobacter spp (?). Viral: paramyxovirus (canine distemper), parvovirus (feline and canine), adenovirus-1, (coronavirus and reovirus-minor or insignificant). Rickettsial: salmon poisoning.\n\nAntimicrobials/antibiotics, parasiticides, antineoplastic agents, heavy metals, insecticides, organophosphate-containing compounds, anti-inflammatory drugs.\n\nDietary indiscretion, engorgement, food hypersensitivity, sudden change in diet.\n\nForeign body, intussusception, volvulus, neoplasia.\n\nRenal failure, hepatic disease, hypoadrenocorticism (Addison's Disease), pancreatitis (acute and chronic).\n\n*Although characteristically associated with chronic disease, the onset of diarrhea may be acute.\n\nChronic diarrhea: Persistent or gradual change in bowel pattern-characterized by increased fluidity, frequency, or volume of stool-that is sustained for more than 1 to 2 weeks despite empiric or supportive therapy (see also Diarrhea, Acute-Onset). In the clinical setting, the clinical history and associated signs should be used to further characterize chronic diarrhea as large bowel or small bowel.\n\nClinical differentiation of small bowel and large bowel diarrhea is fundamentally important for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic diarrhea (Table 3-3) .\n\nLess specific signs associated with chronic diarrheal diseases include dehydration, poorquality hair coat, and fever. On abdominal palpation, discrete masses, thickened bowel loops, pain, or gas may occasionally be detected. Edema, ascites, and pleural effusion in patients with chronic diarrhea suggest substantial protein losses through the bowel. The patient with pallor should be assessed for intestinal bleeding, as well as for an anemia of chronic inflammatory disease.\n\nHematologic signs of most significance include eosinophilia (allergic or inflammatory) and lymphopenia (lymphangiectasia). Hypoproteinemia is associated with extreme malnutrition, protein-losing enteropathies, and enteric blood loss. Hyperglobulinemia is associated with basenji enteropathy.\n\n1. Clinical history and physical examination findings, to classify the diarrhea as small bowel or large bowel. Routine patient screening should include hematologic studies, biochemical profile, fecal flotation and direct examination, and urinalysis.\n\nDIARRHEA, CHRONIC 407\n\nFecal volume Markedly increased daily Normal or slightly increased daily output (large quantity of output (small quantities with each bulky or watery feces with defecation) each defecation) Frequency of defecation Normal or slightly increased (Sudan preparation), starch (iodine preparation), and cytologic staining (Gram stain and Wright's stain) to assess for presence of leukocytes and infectious agents. Malassimilation can be assessed through quantitative fecal fat analysis and fecal weight (daily output), although in clinical practice these tests are seldom performed. Several special biochemical and physical tests can also be carried out on feces: fecal water content, nitrogen content (for azotorrhea and malassimilation), electrolytes, pH, osmolality, fecal occult blood, and cultures for both fungi and bacteria. 4. Tests of absorptive and digestive function, such as trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI), serum folate, and vitamin B 12 assay. 5. GI radiography and ultrasonography. 6. GI endoscopy (gastroscopy, duodenoscopy, and colonoscopy), with biopsy of intestinal mucosa. Duodenal intubation and aspiration can be performed to obtain specimens for cytologic examination and culture. 7. Exploratory laparotomy and intestinal biopsy. 8. Response to empiric treatment: Enzyme replacement or treatment of occult parasite infections.\n\nCyanosis: Bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes resulting from excessive concentration (>5 g/dL) of reduced hemoglobin in the blood. In dogs and cats, cyanosis may develop acutely in hypoxic states or may be chronic. Although cyanosis can develop during hypoxia, the terms are not synonymous. NOTE: The increased concentration of reduced hemoglobin in blood is the result of either an increase in the quantity of venous blood in the cutaneous tissues (passive venous congestion) or a decrease in oxygen saturation in capillary blood. It is the absolute, rather than the relative, amount of reduced hemoglobin that actually causes the cyanosis to develop. If the concentration of hemoglobin is also reduced, the absolute concentration of reduced hemoglobin is also decreased. Therefore, even in severe anemia, cyanosis is not evident. On the other hand, patients with an elevated red blood cell (RBC) mass, or polycythemia, tend to be cyanotic at higher levels of arterial oxygen saturation than patients with a normal RBC mass. Cyanosis also occurs when functional abnormalities of hemoglobin (e.g., methemoglobinemia [dark-brown blood]) exist. In the dog and cat, disorders affecting the oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin are usually drug-or chemical-induced. As little as 1.5 g/dL of methemoglobin or 0.5 g/dL of sulfhemoglobin will produce cyanosis.\n\nCyanosis can result from disorders affecting the cardiovascular system, ventilation, or oxygen-carrying capacity of RBCs. Several cardiovascular diseases, particularly those that compromise cardiac output or are associated with right-to-left vascular shunts, predispose to cyanosis. Therefore, animals with both acquired and congenital cardiac disease are susceptible. Associated signs include cough, respiratory distress, and syncope. The most common congenital heart defects associated with right-to-left shunts are (1) pulmonary valve stenosis as seen in tetralogy of Fallot, stenosis, and ventricular septal defect (VSD) and (2) pulmonary hypertension as seen in patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and VSD.\n\nRespiratory disorders affecting ventilation predispose to cyanosis. Severe infiltrative lung disease (e.g., neoplasia, pulmonary edema, or generalized pneumonia) can produce cyanosis associated with increased respiratory effort.\n\nAnimals that do present with cyanosis not associated with clinical signs other than increased respiratory rate may have abnormal hemoglobin levels, which, if present in sufficient \n\nTrue dyspnea: Pathologic breathlessness ascribed to the unpleasant, distressful sensation of labored breathing most commonly associated with cardiac or pulmonary disease. What actually is and is not true breathlessness in veterinary medicine is difficult to define in clinical practice. Serious respiratory distress associated with substantive respiratory compromise may appear, to the owner at least, as only a minor problem. Physical examination and patient assessment are critical to the recognition and interpretation of this clinical sign.\n\nRespiratory distress may result from (1) the need for oxygen, (2) metabolic aberrations leading to acidosis (a compensatory mechanism), (3) high environmental temperatures (heat stroke), (4) CNS disease, (5) disorders affecting motor innervation to the muscles of respiration, and (6) pain. In any event, once confirmed, diagnostic evaluation of the patient presented in respiratory distress should not be delayed.\n\nThe most common respiratory signs that characterize distress or dyspnea include (1) tachypnea (increased respiratory rate), (2) hyperpnea (increased respiratory rate and depth), (3) orthopnea, and (4) cough. In obstructive upper airway diseases, stridor and stertorous breathing may be present on the initial examination.\n\nFluid accumulation in the thoracic cavity may be accompanied by ascites and hepatomegaly. Physical evidence of hyperadrenocorticism supports thrombolic pulmonary disease. Cyanosis, pallor, evidence of physical trauma, shock, and coma are serious signs often associated with respiratory distress. Table 3 \n\nDysphagia is painful or difficult swallowing. Clinically, dysphagic animals characteristically are presented for making frequent and forced attempts to swallow with or without regurgitation. Signs are most apparent immediately following prehension of food or water.\n\nSwallowing is a complex reflex requiring coordination of multiple muscular and neurologic reactions involving the tongue, palate, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, and gastroesophageal junction. The swallowing reflex is coordinated by cranial nerves V, VII, IX, X, and XI; therefore, neurologic lesions affecting nuclei in the brain stem and reticular formation can alter normal swallowing. Dysphagia may occur as a result of disorders affecting any one of the three swallowing phases: oropharyngeal, esophageal, and gastroesophageal.\n\nBoth morphologic as well as functional lesions affecting the oropharynx, esophagus, stomach, and brain or brain stem may result in dysphagia.\n\nFunctional or motility disorders that affect swallowing include spasticity, incoordination, or failure of muscular contractions, and they result from neurologic disorders, disorders of neuromuscular transmission, or primary muscle disease. Such disorders may be either congenital or acquired. Disorders affecting the oropharyngeal phase of swallowing are responsible for causing pronounced dysphagia, whereas disorders affecting the esophageal and gastroesophageal phases of swallowing are associated with regurgitation.\n\nDysphagia is observed in young animals, particularly in association with congenital esophageal motility disorders and as an acquired condition in older animals. This is more common as a presenting sign in dogs than in cats. There is no sex predisposition.\n\nPrehension of food in animals presented for dysphagia is characteristically normal. Hypersalivation may occasionally be reported, particularly in animals with nasal discharge associated with regurgitation.\n\nRegurgitation is an inconsistent sign associated with dysphagia that does not necessarily correlate with the severity of the underlying disorder. Generally, regurgitation is a consequence of abnormalities of the esophageal and gastroesophageal phases of swallowing.\n\nUpper Airway Hair loss, also called alopecia: Loss or absence of hair in any amounts and any distribution that is the result of one or a combination of disorders affecting the integrity of the hair coat. Therefore, physiologic loss of hair (e.g., normal shedding or hereditary hair loss such as in the Rex cat breed) is excluded from this definition. In clinical practice, hair loss, with and without pruritus, is among the most common reasons a cat, and particularly a dog, is presented. In most cases, the loss of hair is secondary to some underlying disorder rather than being a primary event. The distribution of hair loss is important in that it can be characteristic of the underlying etiology.\n\nAlopecia can be classified on the basis of distribution as (1) diffuse, (2) regional, (3) multifocal, and (4) focal. The causes for hair loss are varied and often complex. Abnormalities of follicular structure may be inherited, ranging from complete absence of hair follicles to selective absence of follicles that produce hair of a specific color. Inflammatory skin diseases that incorporate the hair follicle may disrupt hair growth and maintenance. Bacterial folliculitis, demodectic mange, and follicular hyperkeratosis are examples.\n\nDisorders disrupting the normal follicular cycles can interrupt hair growth without loss or injury to the hair follicle. The cycle is as follows: Anagen (growth phase), Catagen (transitional phase), Telogen (resting phase).\n\nThe complex pathogenesis of alopecia supports a multitude of associated clinical signs in any animal presented for hair loss. Pruritus is an important associated sign if present. Allergic, inflammatory, and parasitic skin diseases are likely to cause pruritus. Secondary traumatic excoriation of the skin may further provoke cutaneous injury, thereby intensifying the pruritus. Alopecia caused by endocrine, genetic, and metabolic factors is less likely to be associated with pruritus, although pruritus may become a factor if the exposed skin becomes particularly dry or sunburned. Immune-mediated diseases leading to alopecia are variably pruritic, depending on the distribution and type of skin injury. Nutritional alopecia is rarely confirmed but can be a source of dermatitis and associated pruritus.\n\nAlopecia without pruritus may be associated with dramatic physical signs resulting from endocrine or metabolic disorders. Dermatologic signs include thickened skin, hyperpigmentation, and dry and brittle hair coat (hypothyroidism). On the other hand, skin may appear thin and lack elasticity (canine Cushing's syndrome, Sertoli cell tumor). Gynecomastia, skin softness, calcinosis cutis, and pigmented macules are other dermatologic signs associated with alopecia.\n\nVirtually all dogs and cats with primary skin disease manifest some degree of alopecia. The pattern of hair loss is typically asymmetric, and primary skin disease can appear to be symmetric (e.g., parasitic dermatoses). In pursuing the diagnosis in dogs or cats presented for hair loss, thorough systemic and skin examinations are indicated. The clinician may find it helpful to characterize a patient's hair loss according to various etiologic categories: Primary cutaneous causes of hair loss include the following: Ataxia is the result of disorders of the conscious or unconscious proprioceptive system, disorders of the cerebellum, or disorders of the vestibular system.\n\nIn the spectrum of disorders causing ataxia, lesions of the vestibular system predominate. However, vestibular signs may result from other brain disorders and spinal cord syndromes. Associated signs include head tilt, nystagmus, circling, and hemiparesis. Patients with cerebellar lesions typically have symmetric signs: hypermetria, abnormally long range of movement (goose-stepping gait); hypometria, abnormally short range of movement; or tremor, particularly of the head.\n\n1. Physical examination, with particular attention to the external ear and tympanic membrane. 2. Neurologic examination, to include assessment of the cranial nerves with the intent of localizing the lesion. \n\nCNS signs secondary to other diseases (e.g., hepatic, renal)\n\nHead trauma with concussive injury to the cerebellum and brain stem\n\nDemyelinating diseases Neuropathies Cerebellar abiotrophy\n\nFeline vestibular syndrome Geriatric canine vestibular syndrome Acute labyrinthitis\n\nIn practice, polyuria (PU) and polydipsia (PD) are loosely interpreted to mean an increase in urination and water consumption, respectively. The fact that polyuria is an abnormal increase in urine production, usually of low specific gravity, is seldom confirmed in practice. Likewise, although polydipsia is an abnormal or absolute increase in water consumption usually associated with increased thirst, water intake is seldom quantitated. Use of the terms polyuria and polydipsia is usually justified when a client presents a dog or cat for subjective increases in urination frequency and water intake as the primary problem. When clear evidence of increased urination and increased thirst is not present, actual documentation of 24-hour urinary output and water intake may be necessary.\n\nPolydipsia is a compensatory sign that develops subsequent to polyuria. Primary polydipsia with compensatory polyuria is uncommon.\n\nThe pathophysiology behind polyuria is complex in that several renal and nonrenal mechanisms can be involved. Diseases affecting proximal tubules (e.g., primary renal failure, renal glycosuria) or those causing high solute loads overwhelming proximal tubule absorptive capacity (e.g., diabetes mellitus) cause osmotic diuresis. Water conservation is also affected at the level of the loop of Henle (e.g., primary renal disease, diuretics) and in the distal tubules and collecting ducts. Disorders of the distal tubule and collecting duct are frequently responsible for polyuria, including diabetes insipidus, pyometra, hyperadrenocorticism, liver failure, and hypercalcemia.\n\nPolyuria does result in subsequent failure of the sodium chloride pump in the loop of Henle, leading to significant decreases in the renal medullary osmotic gradient. Liver failure resulting in urea depletion and prolonged polyuria can cause medullary washout.\n\nPrimary polydipsia subsequent to increased thirst can cause secondary polyuria but is an uncommon clinical finding. Compulsive water drinking (pseudopsychogenic polydipsia) is probably the most important type of primary polydipsia, although the underlying cause is not known. Hypothalamic lesions, hypercalcemia, and increased levels of plasma renin are less common causes of primary polydipsia.\n\nSigns associated with PU or PD are varied and dependent on the underlying disease. Generalized signs include weakness, decreased appetite, weight loss, diarrhea, and fever. Polyphagia with weight loss occurs in animals with diabetes mellitus and in cats with hyperthyroidism. Paraneoplastic syndromes, particularly hypercalcemia, may develop in conjunction with PU or PD. A comprehensive physical examination and a laboratory assessment are justified in all patients presented with PU or PD as the primary complaint.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC PLANS (Figure 3-3) 1. History and physical examination, to facilitate verification of the problem in addition to determining the duration of the problem and associated signs. Of particular importance is knowledge of the recent administration of medication. \n\nPruritus: Abnormally frequent scratching or biting that results from unpleasant, sometimes intense, epidermal stimulation. Histamine, endopeptidases, and other polypeptides liberated from skin cells serve as mediators of pruritus. Histamine is the primary mediator of itch associated with wheal-and-flare reaction. Histamine-mediated itching cannot be completely inhibited by either H 1 -or H 2 -receptor antagonists (blockers). Other polypeptides (such as bradykinin), \u03b2-endorphin, and neuropeptides, such as substance P, can induce itching when applied directly to skin. The close association between itching and inflammation of the skin is attributed to the fact that many of the endogenous mediators and potentiators are released in situ during inflammatory events.\n\nItching, although a protective response, can become more harmful than helpful. As a feature of dermatitis, itch mediators cannot be removed by the patient. In fact, scratching and biting eventually promote more inflammation and subsequently perpetuate the itching. \n\nSkin lesions are commonly associated with pruritus; however, it becomes important to characterize the lesion and to distinguish those that are primary from those that are secondary to scratching or biting. Papules and pustules are characteristic primary lesions that may ultimately develop into secondary lesions, such as crusts, ulcers, scale in collarettes, and pigmented macules. Vesicules and bullae, plaques, and urticaria (wheals) can also occur as primary skin lesions. Linear crusts, irregular ulceration, lichenification, diffuse scaling and pigmentation, and patchy alopecia are characteristic lesions that develop secondary to excoriation. Pruritus can also occur without primary lesions (i.e., \"essential\" pruritus). This type of itching is a manifestation of systemic disease, although mediation may be central or cutaneous. Causes include atopy, dry skin, and neurogenic and psychogenic disorders. A spectrum of renal, hepatic, hematopoietic, allergic, and endocrine diseases are associated with essential pruritus.\n\n1. History and physical examination, to characterize the skin lesion and its distribution, to determine whether or not the condition appears to be contagious, and to determine whether or not systemic disease is present. 3 . Skin and coat examination. Perform multiple skin scrapings, and examine skin and hair coat with Wood's light. 4. Microbiologic testing for bacteria and dermatophytes. 5. Immunologic testing, to include intradermal skin testing and direct fluorescent antibody testing of skin (both normal and affected) biopsy specimens. 6. Skin biopsy with dermatohistopathology. 7. Provocative exposure to selected environmental agents, diet, and drugs.\n\nJoint swelling, or joint enlargement: Any abnormal increase in size, either visible or palpable, of any joint that is not directly caused by a proliferation of tissue. In practice, joint swelling is the primary presenting sign only occasionally. Pain and associated lameness are more likely causes for presentation, whereas actual enlargement of a joint is detected during physical examination. However, there is not necessarily an association between joint swelling and pain.\n\nJoint swelling, or effusion, occurs subsequent to injury to the synovial membrane in which there is not only an increase in volume of synovial fluid produced, but quantitative biochemical and cellular changes as well. Most joint swelling is attributed to inflammation of the synovial membrane, or synovitis. Abnormal synovial fluid accumulation (effusion) may be classified as serous, fibrinous, purulent, septic, or hemorrhagic.\n\nAlthough lameness is the most common clinical sign associated with joint swelling, it is not consistently present. Joint swelling may also be associated with, or mistaken for, hyperplasia, metaplasia, or neoplasia of the synovium, joint capsule, articular cartilage, or periarticular bone. Hemorrhagic joint effusion (hemarthrosis) may be associated with coagulopathy and spontaneous bleeding from the respiratory, GI, or urinary tract. Subluxation or fracture of a carpus, tarsus, or stifle may also be associated with detectable joint swelling. Arthritis associated with systemic disease (e.g., infectious or immune mediated) can also be accompanied by significant joint swelling.\n\n1. History. The history generally focuses on associated signs rather than primary joint swelling and should address duration, exposure to ticks, known injury, and evidence of spontaneous bleeding. Physical examination establishes the presence of joint swelling and the number of joints involved. Evidence of inflammation, crepitus, joint laxity, abnormal range of motion, a drawer sign, luxations, or fractures should be determined. 2. Radiography of the affected joint(s). 3. Synovial fluid analysis, including biochemical, cytologic, and culture findings. 4. Coagulation profile in the presence of hemarthrosis. 5. Immune function testing: ANA titer, rheumatoid factor, and LE cell preparation. 6. Contrast arthrography. 7. Joint capsule-synovial membrane biopsy. 8. Periarticular bone biopsy. 9. Surgical exploration of the affected joint.\n\nAnorexia: Strictly speaking, anorexia is the lack or loss of appetite for food. In veterinary medicine, this term is loosely used to describe diminished or partial, as opposed to complete loss of, interest in eating. In addition, part of the difficulty in assessing the patient that is presented for loss of appetite is grounded in owner expectation of what is and what is not a normal appetite in a dog or cat. While domesticated pets do tend to eat at regular intervals throughout the day, some do experience transient periods of sustained inappetence that may, in fact, be entirely normal and not associated with underlying disease. When assessing a dog or cat for partial loss of appetite, careful history and physical evaluation are indicated to determine whether or not underlying disease may be the cause of this vague clinical sign. In addition, the clinical history must establish the duration of the anorexia and whether the loss of appetite is complete or partial.\n\nWhat makes anorexia such an important clinical sign is the fact that loss of appetite is the very first outward sign the owner may notice when a pet is ill.\n\nWhat makes anorexia such an important clinical sign is the fact that loss of appetite is the first outward sign the owner may notice when a pet is ill. Anorexia is regarded as a low-yield clinical sign-that is, it is not a discrete sign and, like pain, may be associated with numerous underlying disorders.\n\nHistorical evidence of a significant change in the pet's environment (e.g., a new child in the family) or daily routine (e.g., the dog is home alone during the day for the first time) is important to assess. Knowledge of current drug therapy, whether the pet eats sticks or other foreign material, whether or not the pet food type recently changed or may not be fresh (moldy canned and dry food will generally not be consumed) is important.\n\nPhysical examination should determine overall body conformation, body weight, extent of weight loss (if present), and any obvious external injuries that might contribute. Age is an important factor in the assessment of anorexia. Diminished sense of smell, neoplasia, joint \n\ndisease, and dental disease are common age-related disorders that may contribute to anorexia.\n\nDifferential diagnoses associated with anorexia are too numerous to be of assistance in resolving to a diagnosis. The clinician faced with a patient that has only anorexia is faced with a significant clinical challenge in defining the underlying disorder. Even the categories of disease that could be associated with inappetence are wide ranging and include psychologic, metabolic, orthopedic, infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic causes. \n\nLymphadenomegaly: Any change in the size or consistency of a lymph node or group of lymph nodes. Lymphadenomegaly refers to those lymph nodes that are larger than expected with or without commensurate changes in consistency. Involved nodes may be unusually soft, firm, or painful, suggestive of inflammation; whereas enlarged, firm, nonpainful lymph nodes suggest neoplasia. Lymphadenomegaly is usually not a presenting problem, with the possible exception of generalized enlargements of all superficial lymph nodes. Lymph nodes become enlarged as a result of inflammation (pyogenic or granulomatous), reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, or neoplasia (primary or neoplastic). In pyogenic inflammation, neutrophils dilate and engorge the sinuses; whereas in granulomatous inflammation, an infiltrate or macrophages is present (e.g., systemic mycoses). Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia is associated with an increase in the number of germinal centers within the lymph node and an infiltrate of plasma cells. In neoplastic lymph nodes, tumor cells may invade the sinuses (metastatic), gradually destroying the normal node architecture, or the architecture of the lymph node is entirely replaced by malignant lymphocytes (lymphosarsoma)that is, histologically, the sinuses are obliterated and germinal centers cannot be found.\n\nCharacterize the consistency and number of affected nodes as well as their location (i.e., generalized or regional). Lymph node pain is an inconsistent finding usually associated with inflammatory disease rather than neoplasia. Associated signs are likely to be regional, as is the lymph node enlargement (i.e., tissue injury or infection). Patients with generalized lymphadenomegaly may not have associated signs, or there may be nonspecific signs, including weight loss, fever, decreased appetite, and lassitude as a result of systemic illness.\n\n1. History and physical examination, to determine the duration and type of associated signs, if any, and the duration of lymph node enlargement, if known.\n\n2. Laboratory profile, with emphasis on CBC, including platelet count; biochemistry panel; and urinalysis. 3. Specific tests for infectious diseases, as indicated (e.g., FeLV antigen and FIV antibody). 4. Thoracic and abdominal radiographs, as indicated. 5. Fine-needle aspiration of affected lymph node(s). 6. Serum protein electrophoresis. 7. Bone marrow aspirate. 8. Lymph node biopsy and, if indicated, culture.\n\nThe perception of an unpleasant sensation; may be generalized or localized. While pain may be the single most common presenting complaint of humans who seek medical attention from a physician, the ability of a dog or cat to communicate pain and the ability of the owner to interpret the signs correctly make this a particularly complex clinical sign in animals.\n\nAs in humans, the actual perception and manifestation of pain varies from one animal to another. Fundamental to the ability to interpret the presence of pain in an animal is the ability to recognize a change in behavior. Acute injury and associated pain is relatively simple to ascertain. However, chronic pain emanating from a specific organ or tissue (e.g., liver or bone) can be extremely difficult to define and localize. Other signs that may be associated with pain include sleeplessness; unusual posture; decreased activity; decreased appetite; reluctance to play, walk, or run; agitation; or altered grooming behavior. Physical findings are also highly varied and may include such findings as hypersalivation, mydriasis, tachycardia, shivering, or increased respiratory rate. Unfortunately, despite efforts to objectively measure pain in animals, there are no tests that clearly define whether or not an individual animal is experiencing pain.\n\nNote: Pain Management has become increasingly recognized as an essential part of clinical practice today. Section 1(Tables 1-17 to 1-22) addresses indications of the drugs and doses most commonly employed in pain management of dogs and cats. \n\nMany disorders are associated with pain. Hence, developing a list of differential diagnoses becomes impractical. Since pain is characteristically associated with inflammation or tissue trauma, every effort should be made to localize the source of the pain in order to focus the diagnostic search. Localizing acute-onset pain is generally less problematic than localizing chronic pain. Particularly in the patient with nonlocalizing, chronic pain, developing a clear diagnostic plan is essential in establishing a diagnosis.\n\n1. Careful observation of the patient as it moves, stands, sits, lies down, and so on is critical. 2. A methodical physical examination. 3. A standard laboratory profile to include hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis (fecal is optional depending on the presenting signs). 4. Radiography or other imaging study is indicated if the pain can be localized to a discrete region of the body (e.g., abdominal cavity). 5. Special diagnostic tests are indicated if specific abnormalities can be detected (e.g., biopsy, aspiration and cytopathology, myelography). 6. In some patients, empiric treatment with anagesics or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may be indicated. However, utilizing this method for managing pain requires the ability to provide follow-up care to that patient.\n\nRegurgitation: Retrograde esophageal transport of ingesta subsequent to a mechanical, neurogenic, or myogenic swallowing disorder. Owners most often describe regurgitation as \"vomiting.\" Both regurgitation and vomiting imply a backward flowing of ingesta through the esophagus; however, regurgitation is a relatively effortless act in contrast to the retching and abdominal pressure characteristic of vomiting. Regurgitation localizes the problem to the esophagus. The pathophysiology of esophageal function is addressed and referenced in the article on dysphagia. Both acquired (e.g., foreign body) and congenital (e.g., familial megaesophagus) forms and esophageal disease can lead to regurgitation. Many esophageal problems remain undiagnosed if regurgitation is not present.\n\nPhysical signs recognized by owners of dogs or cats with regurgitation include dysphagia characterized by difficulty swallowing food, frequent attempts to swallow food, and hypersalivation. Belching may also be reported subsequent to the entrapment of air in the esophagus. Inappetence and weight loss subsequently develop. Esophageal dilatation may be observed at the level of the lower cervical esophagus or thoracic inlet.\n\nOwners may report expulsion of blood-tinged saliva subsequent to esophageal mucosal injury. Paroxysms of coughing and retching, particularly when eating, may be present along with difficult breathing in animals with significant pneumonia. Nasal discharge may consist of mucoid to mucopurulent exudates or of food and liquid recently consumed.\n\nRarely, affected animals present with swollen joints, lameness, and severe weakness associated with hypertrophic osteodystrophy subsequent to an intrathoracic lesion. Atypical signs include inspiratory dyspnea, regurgitation unrelated to eating, and recurrent gastric bloating associated with aerophagia. (Box 3-19) \n\n1. History and physical examination, to characterize the nature of the problem, to distinguish between vomiting and regurgitation, and to establish the character of the regurgitated material. 2. Laboratory database, to assess patient status, particularly if secondary complications are present. 3. Survey thoracic and cervical radiography, to assess presence of megaesophagus, radiopaque intraesophageal lesion, or both. 4. Contrast esophagram, to confirm any interference with normal bolus transport at the point of obstruction, changes in mucosal integrity or luminal displacement, and the presence of extraluminal gas. (Oral suspension of barium sulfate is recommended over other contrast materials.) NOTE: Contrast medium retention in the esophagus is the hallmark of a motor disorder and often localizes the site of dysmotility. 5. Endoscopy and, as indicated, biopsy, to determine the cause of megaesophagus rather than to diagnose megaesophagus. In some instances, especially foreign body obstruction, endoscopy may be therapeutic. 6. Special procedures, to include contrast esophagram during fluoroscopy, CT, and exploratory laparotomy.\n\nPrimary (or congenital) Secondary (or acquired) Foreign body Esophageal stricture Esophageal diverticula Neurogenic (e.g., myasthenia gravis, rabies) Myopathy, smooth muscle Extraesophageal compressive lesion (e.g., neoplasia) Vascular anomaly\n\nForeign body obstruction Intrathoracic mass Vascular ring anomaly Esophageal stricture *The most prevalent cause.\n\nThe terms seizure, convulsion, epilepsy, epileptic attack, and fit all describe a clinical sign that is characterized by involuntary contraction of a series of voluntary muscles. Seizures result from disorders of the brain that cause spontaneous depolarizations and excitation of cerebral neurons. As a presenting problem, seizures are much more common in the dog than in the cat.\n\nSuch disorders may originate from extracranial causes, metabolic or toxic diseases, and intracranial causes (e.g., organic brain disease). When seizures occur in the absence of detectable organic or metabolic CNS abnormalities, the seizures are described as idiopathic. Idiopathic epilepsy is the most common type of seizure reported in companion animal species.\n\nA distinction is made between partial seizures (also called focal seizures) and generalized seizures. Three classes of partial seizure are recognized: partial motor seizures (the most common type of seizure in animals), psychomotor seizures, and sensory seizures. Partial seizures are caused by a cortical lesion or focus that periodically disrupts cerebral function. Generalized motor seizures represent a widespread disorder not referable to any single anatomic or functional system. Clinical manifestations suggest widespread activation of the brain.\n\nSeizures may be repeated frequently in groups of two or three, or they may occur singly. If a series of seizures occurs and the patient fails to regain consciousness during the interictal period, the term status epilepticus applies. In contrast to a single seizure, status epilepticus is a serious, life-threatening condition that justifies emergency intervention.\n\nGeneralized motor seizures are the most prevalent type of seizure encountered in veterinary medicine. Most cases are diagnosed as idiopathic epilepsy on the basis that organic causes of seizure activity cannot be identified. The interictal period in animals with a history of generalized motor seizures is characteristically described by owners as normal. The immediate postictal period, regardless of the cause of the seizure activity, is often associated with transient disorientation, blindness, stumbling, polydipsia, or polyphagia.\n\nThe spectrum of possible clinical signs associated with seizure activity is extensive. Before a diagnosis of idiopathic epilepsy is reached, it is important that the patient be evaluated for cardiovascular disease, trauma, toxicity, infectious disease, parasites, neoplasia, and metabolic disorders, particularly those affecting the kidney, liver, and endocrine pancreas.\n\nSeizures in young animals (<1 year old) are commonly caused by developmental abnormalities, hydrocephalus, lissencephaly, encephalitis (infectious), lead poisoning, severe intestinal parasitism, portacaval shunt abnormalities, and juvenile hypoglycemia. Idiopathic epilepsy usually begins when animals are 1 to 3 years of age. Animals over 5 years of age are more likely to have CNS tumors or hypoglycemia from insulin-secreting beta cell pancreatic neoplasms.\n\nSome basic knowledge about breed predisposition to seizure disorders may be helpful in establishing a diagnosis. Idiopathic epilepsy has been seen in numerous dog breeds, particularly German Shepherd Dogs, Belgian Tervurens, Keeshonds, Saint Bernards, Standard and Miniature Poodles, Beagles, Irish Setters, Cocker Spaniels, Alaskan Malamutes, Siberian Huskies, and Labrador and Golden Retrievers. Juvenile hypoglycemia is most prevalent in toy breeds. Hydrocephalus is common in the toy and brachycephalic breeds. Neoplastic diseases are common in brachycephalic breeds over 5 years of age.\n\nConcerning disorders of CNS metabolism, leukodystrophy is most common in Cairn and West Highland whites; lipodystrophy in German Short-Haired Pointers and English Setters; lissencephaly in the Lhasa Apso; and portacaval shunts and hyperlipoproteinemia in Miniature Schnauzers. A unique, usually fatal, encephalitis occurs in Pugs.\n\nExposure to infectious agents or other sick animals may be important, as is exposure to sources of intoxicants, such as lead in paints, linoleum, tar, batteries, or roofing material; hexachlorophene soap; ethylene glycol (antifreeze); metaldehyde snail bait; and various other insecticides, including chlorinated hydrocarbons, organophosphates, and rodenticides. Dogs and cats on the same premises with swine may be exposed to Herpesvirus suis (pseudorabies, or Auzjesky's disease). A high protein diet exacerbates hepatic encephalopathy. Thiamine deficiency may result from long-term consumption of certain fish diets or from cooking pet food. (Table 3-6) DIAGNOSTIC PLANS 1. History, to take into consideration breed predisposition, environmental exposures, past medical illnesses, and medication. Because most seizures are of short duration and the physical (tonic-clonic) manifestations of a seizure are so dramatic, requesting the owner to describe the type and duration of seizure may elicit unreliable information. 2. Thorough physical examination, to include careful neurologic examination, with particular attention to cranial nerves, funduscopic examination, and cardiac auscultation. 3. Laboratory database, essential to rule out metabolic causes. In addition to a CBC, biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and fecal culture, any or all of the following tests are indicated: serum ammonia, bile acids, serum insulin in hypoglycemic patients, blood lead test, and serial blood cultures. 4. Survey radiographs of the skull. These are rarely helpful, as intracranial neoplasms are not detectable on conventional skull radiographs. 5 . In special circumstances, limited ultrasound examination of the brain may be possible in young dogs through a cranial fontanelle. Evidence of hydrocephalus may be seen. 6. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (special facilities required). 7. Electrocardiogram or echocardiogram, if indicated. 8. Serologic studies for canine distemper, rabies, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), FeLV, FIV, toxoplasmosis, and systemic (deep) mycoses. 9. CSF analysis, including biochemistries, antibody titers, and cytologic parameters. 10. EEG. Although limited in availability, the EEG may be useful in detecting inflammatory brain disease and congenital intracranial abnormalities (e.g., hydrocephalus). 11. Contrast studies, requiring special equipment or facilities: radioisotope brain scan, cerebral angiography, pneumoencephalography, and CT scan.\n\nSneezing: A protective reflex described as a sudden, involuntary, and forceful, even violent, expulsion of air from the upper respiratory tract; may or may not be accompanied by significant nasal discharge. Clients easily recognize sneezing. Although sneezing is a physiologic response to irritating stimuli, increased frequency and paroxysmal sneezing episodes are readily recognized as abnormal. Like sneezing, a nasal discharge, regardless of its consistency, is a clinical sign that clients accurately interpret and reliably describe to the clinician. Sneezing is the outward manifestation of nasal passage irritation by extraneous (foreign material) or endogenous (antigen-antibody interaction) agents. Afferent impulses travel via the fifth cranial nerve to the medulla, where the initial reflex is triggered. Chronic nasal discharge is a clinical sign that localizes a disorder to the upper respiratory passages, particularly the nasal cavity and frontal sinuses.\n\nImportant associated signs suggesting systemic involvement include facial asymmetry (neoplasia or fungal infection), atrophy of the masseter and temporal muscles, difficulty prehending or masticating food, conjunctivitis, and ocular discharge. Epistaxis, which is distinguished from blood-tinged nasal discharge, is an important associated sign that further supports intranasal disease or coagulopathy. Cleft palate is a common cause of nasal discharge in neonates. Erosion and depigmentation of the planum nasale is often associated with nasal aspergillosis in dogs, whereas cats with nasal cryptococosis may have a detectable granuloma at the rostral aspect of the nose. Occasionally, cough is associated with purulent nasal discharges and sneezing.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC PLANS (Figure 3-4) \n\nSpontaneous or prolonged bleeding: The visible, abnormal discharge of blood resulting from a failure of one or more hemostatic mechanisms. May result from deficiencies in platelet numbers or function, in the extrinsic or intrinsic coagulation cascades, or in vascular integrity.\n\nThe hemostatic response is a complex defense system that fulfills three basic functions: ensures that blood is confined to the vascular system of the normal animal (vascular integrity), causes the arrest of bleeding at sites of vascular injury, and maintains the patency of the vascular network.\n\nThese functions are accomplished through complex interactions between blood platelets, the blood vessel wall, and a variety of plasma enzyme systems. Disorders affecting these interactions can result in spontaneous or prolonged bleeding.\n\nThe primary phase of hemostasis occurs with platelet aggregation and the formation of the relatively unstable platelet plug. The secondary phase of hemostasis, essential to complete hemostasis, reinforces the platelet plug with fibrin. Secondary hemostasis depends on adequate plasma concentration of procoagulant proteins and on their proper interaction. Coagulation can be initiated through an intrinsic pathway, which involves components normally found within the vasculature and which is activated by contact with a foreign surface. The extrinsic pathway is an alternative mechanism through which clotting is initiated.\n\nSecondary hemostasis is regulated by inhibitory products that limit the extent of enzymatic reaction and prevent their dissemination: antithrombin III, a potent inhibitor of kallikrein; factors IXa, XIa, XIIa, and Xa; and thrombin. The fibrinolytic system, another plasma protein-enzyme system, removes the hemostatic plug once its function has been served.\n\nBleeding disorders are most apparent when bleeding develops spontaneously from one or more body orifices and is prolonged. Bleeding from the nose (epistaxis: see Figure 3 -4) is perhaps the most commonly reported outward manifestation of a bleeding disorder in dogs. Bleeding into the skin or mucous membranes (e.g., petechiation) may not be immediately apparent to even the most observant owner. Excessive or prolonged bleeding into soft tissues (hematoma) or joints (hemarthrosis) may be seen as physical enlargement of the affected tissues with pain and lameness. There may be a history of recurrent minor bleeding episodes in some animals. The severity of clinical signs depends on such factors as type of defect, degree of clotting factor activity, and individual variation. Moderately to severely affected animals are typically young at the time of presentation. Prolonged bleeding subsequent to elective surgical procedures may be the first sign of a bleeding disorder. \n\nDyschezia: Painful or difficult evacuation of feces from the rectum. In the clinical setting, dyschezia may be a difficult problem to ascertain unless the owner is particularly astute and is able to distinguish effort to urinate (see Dysuria) from effort to defecate in cats and female dogs. Therefore, a concerted effort on the part of the clinician is usually necessary to differentiate disorders affecting the urinary outflow tract and micturition from disorders affecting defecation. The most likely cause for any animal to present with dyschezia is rectal or perianal pain. The origin of the pain may be mucosal, mucocutaneous (anal), or extraluminal lesions. Rectal strictures are uncommon but may contribute to constipation and associated dyschezia. Strictures typically develop subsequent to neoplasia or deep, nonpenetrating injury to the rectum. Although uncommon, dyschezia may also occur subsequent to lesions in the lumbar spinal cord or sacrum.\n\nThe most common response to dyschezia is constipation, although many owners do not recognize this as a primary problem. Not uncommonly, the pain associated with rectal lesions is intense during attempts to defecate. The animal may cry or turn abruptly and lick the anus in response to the pain. Dogs may circle while assuming the position to defecate. Cats are more likely to make many attempts at defecation or may manifest inappropriate defecation in locations outside of the litter box. Unless attempting defecation, the animal is likely not to manifest pain at all. \n\nHypoprothrombinemia (factor II)-Boxers Hypoproconvertinemia (factor VII)-Beagles, Malamutes Hemophilia A (factor VIII)-most dog breeds and cats Hemophilia B (factor IX)-several dog breeds and British short-hair cats von Willebrand's disease (vWD factor)-most dog breeds Stuart factor deficiency (factor X)-Cocker Spaniels Plasma thromboplastin antecedent (PTA) deficiency (factor XI)-Springer Spaniels, Great Pyrenees, Kerry Blue Terriers Hageman factor deficiency (factor XII)-cats\n\nThrombasthenia (Glanzmann's disease)* Thrombopathia (e.g., osteogenesis imperfecta, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome)*\n\nChemical-or drug-induced Vitamin K deficiency Rodenticide ingestion Prolonged enteric antimicrobial therapy* Circulating anticoagulants Heparin Warfarin Warfarin-like chemical (e.g., diphacinone) Plasma expander therapy* Antifactor antibody* Liver disease DIC Vitamin K deficiency Decreased factor synthesis subsequent to severe liver disease*\n\nThrombocytopenia (relatively common) Decreased or ineffective thrombopoiesis* Immunologic destruction: immune-mediated, infectious, drug-induced Consumption: DIC, vasculitis Sequestration: splenomegaly subsequent to neoplasia* Dilutional: IV fluid administration* Platelet dysfunction Secondary to underlying disease: renal failure and uremia, hepatic failure, polycythemia* Drug-induced: aspirin, phenylbutazone, estrogen, phenothiazines, plasma expanders* Physical examination should include digital examination of the rectum and inspection of the perineum and each anal sac for evidence of lesions. It is important to consider shaving the perineum to assess the integrity of the skin for evidence of lesions, particularly neoplasia.\n\n1. History and physical examination, to determine the ability of the patient to urinate versus defecate. Physical examination must include the following: a. Rectal temperature, as a means of detecting source of pain. b. Rectal examination, expressing both anal glands and assessing the character of the discharge (sedation may be required). c. Evaluation of the perianal skin (shaving the perineum is recommended). 2. Fecal examination for occult blood. 3. Abdominal radiographs or abdominal ultrasound to assess prostate size (in male dogs), presence of intra-abdominal masses, or presence of fecalith formation. 4. Colonoscopy or proctoscopy, with rigid or flexible endoscope and biopsy of any obvious lesions. Recovered tissues should be examined cytologically and by histopathology. Anesthesia is rarely required for this procedure unless the integrity of the rectal mucosa is substantially compromised or pain is significant. 5. Rarely, exploratory laparotomy, to further elucidate the nature of abnormal intraabdominal findings. Owner observations are not entirely reliable in describing dysuria. Therefore, physical examination is usually necessary to differentiate attempts to defecate from attempts to urinate and to distinguish between incontinence and dysuria. Dysuria generally results from disorders of the lower urinary tract (bladder or urethra), genital tract (prostate or vagina), or both that induce an impediment to urinary outflow resulting in abnormal micturition or inappropriate urination. However, a variety of neurologic lesions, particularly lesions in the caudal lumbar spine and sacrum affecting either parasympathetic or sympathetic innervation to the lower urinary tract, can result in dysuria. Neurologic dysurias are among the most difficult to characterize and to treat.\n\nClinical signs associated with dysuria can often be localized to the point of the primary lesion in the lower genitourinary tract. Dysuria is commonly associated with discolored urine (particularly hematuria), pyuria, or both, subsequent to mucosal inflammation and infection. Certain causes of urinary incontinence may also result in dysuria. The owner may also report frequent attempts at urination by the animal.\n\nDistinguish between two additional clinical signs associated with dysuria: polyuria (increased volume) versus pollakiuria (increased frequency). Patients with dysuria may also manifest strangury, defined as a slow, painful discharge of urine caused by spasm of the bladder and urethra. In male dogs, dysuria caused by an enlarged prostate may also be associated with constipation.\n\n1. Preliminary measures. The initial diagnostic plan depends on confirmation of dysuria at presentation and whether, on abdominal palpation, the urinary bladder is empty or distended (Figure 3-5 \n\nCongenital (primary) lymphedema-an autosomal dominant trait primarily affecting the hindlimbs by 3-6 mo of age Acquired (secondary) lymphedema (focal or regional) Infectious, granulomatous, neoplastic, traumatic injury, or compression of lymphatics\n\nMyxedema (hypothyroidism)-rare visceral efferent neurons in the sacral segments that innervate the detrusor muscle via the pelvic nerves are facilitated. The somatic efferent neurons in the sacral segments that innervate the striate urethralis muscle via the pudendal nerve are inhibited. Facilitation of these pudendal somatic neurons prevents urination. Urinary incontinence is the physical manifestation of any one of several disorders affecting voluntary urine retention in the bladder. Neurologic lesions involving either upper motor or lower motor neuron segments of the micturition reflex arc result in urinary incontinence. A paralytic bladder usually results in bladder overdistention and urine dribbling. Urine can be easily expressed by manual compression of the bladder in affected patients. A \"cord bladder\" is caused by a lesion between the brain and the spinal reflex center of micturition. There is usually temporary bladder paralysis followed by involuntary reflex micturition subsequent to manual compression.\n\nNon-neurogenic urinary incontinence may be due to anatomic or functional disorders (e.g., ectopic ureters) affecting the storage phase of micturition. Hormone-responsive incontinence is also a common form of non-neurogenic urinary incontinence. In these patients, the detrusor reflex is normal and the animal exhibits normal urination behavior in addition to urine dribbling.\n\nA number of disorders of micturition are associated with excessive outlet resistance (e.g., urethral calculi, neoplasia) during voiding. Bladder overdistention and urine dribbling are frequently accompanied by dysuria and hematuria.\n\nEvidence of urine or blood-tinged urine on the hair coat around the genitalia or on the patient's sleeping surface is frequently the first sign of a micturition disorder that owners recognize. Patients with neurogenic urinary incompetence may show evidence of spinal cord disease with conscious proprioceptive deficits in the hindlimbs, foot drag, and abrasions on the dorsal aspect of the hindfeet. However, lesions involving the cerebral cortex and cerebellum may also be associated with incontinence, as can behavioral disorders.\n\nObvious straining to urinate, particularly if associated with an enlarged abdomen, may indicate obstructive disease. Affected patients may be uremic, manifesting characteristic signs of lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting.\n\n1. History and physical examination. The size of the urinary bladder must also be determined. 2. Neurologic examination. A thorough neurologic examination should be performed in an attempt to establish or rule out a neurogenic cause. Particular emphasis is given to the spinal cord and sacral nerve roots. The bulbourethral and perineal reflexes should be assessed. The inability to perceive visual stimuli. Because loss of visual function in animals is typically characterized by a change in behavior, the ability of pet owners to detect vision loss depends on their perception of changes in the animal's awareness of and interaction with its surroundings. Vision loss is likely to be apparent to owners only when there is complete loss of vision. An owner is unlikely to detect visual deficits, such as partial vision loss or unilateral blindness, because of the animal's ability to compensate. Blindness can occur in any of four ways: lesions causing opacification of clear ocular media (e.g., cornea, aqueous humor, or lens); failure of the retina to process visual images; failure of neurologic transmission; and failure in the final image processing (i.e., cortical blindness).\n\nWhen an animal is presented with acute visual loss, the owner is usually describing a bilateral ocular disease problem or the possibility of a CNS problem. Acute unilateral visual loss problems are not often recognized except by the very astute animal owner or observer. For the veterinarian, initial assessment of the animal with acute visual loss depends initially on confirming that the ocular media are clear and allow light to pass from the anterior ocular segment and reach the photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) in the posterior ocular segment. Transillumination should be used to evaluate the ocular media. Such conditions as acute bilateral uveitis, severe corneal edema, bilateral acute keratitis, rapidly developing metabolic cataracts, or acute cyclitis with vitreous involvement may alter the ocular media to interfere with light transmission. Both direct and indirect pupillary responses should be evaluated while evaluating the anterior ocular media. Once it has been determined that light can reach the posterior ocular segment, a fundus evaluation should be done. Fundic abnormalities associated with acute visual loss may include acute chorioretinitis, often with exudative retinal detachments; acute choroidal hemorrhages, often associated with abnormal blood pressure in chronic renal disease; and acute optic neuritis.\n\nAcute visual loss in the dog without accompanying fundic lesions that can be seen on ophthalmoscopic examination may be associated with a retrobulbar optic neuritis or with the syndrome of sudden acquired retinal degeneration in the dog (SARDS). SARDS is poorly understood. The syndrome appears to involve middle-aged to old female dogs and there is a breed predilection for the dachshund. The visual loss may first start as a nyctalopia and progress over a period of weeks to complete visual loss. In some cases the visual loss is generalized and acute. Associated systemic signs of polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, obesity, and hepatomegaly may be present. Laboratory profiles may show abnormal differentials in the WBC count, elevated liver enzymes, an abnormal response to ACTH stimulation testing, or an abnormal response to low-dose dexamethasone suppression testing. The fundus may appear absolutely normal or early signs of retinal thinning and atrophy may be evident. Differential diagnosis with an optic neuritis is based on electroretinography (ERG) testing in which the ERG response is flat in SARDS but the ERG response is normal in optic neuritis. The cause of SARDS is unknown.\n\nAcute visual loss associated with tumors of the CNS, particularly CNS tumors that involve the optic chiasm, are infrequently reported in the dog. Pituitary tumors are most likely to be the source. Pituitary tumors must become macroadenomas before invading and involving midbrain structures and the optic chiasm region. It is not uncommon for macroadenomas to be nonfunctional; thus, the affected animal may not develop any clinical metabolic abnormalities. Papilledema is rarely observed with brain tumors in dogs. Although pituitary macroadenomas that produce chiasmal compression and visual loss are rare in dogs, the differential diagnosis must still be considered.\n\nThe availability of CT has provided the ability to diagnose tumors of the hypophysis that may be associated with acute visual loss. Additionally, the use of the same technique has made visualization of the adrenal glands and the ability to diagnose bilateral adrenal gland hyperplasia easier. Pituitary macroadenomas are larger than 1 cm in diameter.\n\nOptic neuritis may present as an acute visual loss problem. There may or may not be observable ophthalmoscopic changes of the optic nerve. Ophthalmoscopic abnormalities are characterized by edema of the disk, hemorrhages in and around the disk, edema, and inflammation of the surrounding retinal tissue. Acute optic neuritis often persists as a retrobulbar lesion without any ophthalmoscopically observable lesions. Pupils are widely dilated and nonresponsive or poorly responsive to light. In suspected acute optic neuritis, a complete physical examination, including a neurologic evaluation, peripheral blood count, and CSF analysis, should be performed, if possible. The presence of pleiocytosis and increased protein content in the CSF is of significance. It may be difficult to specifically diagnose the cause of acute optic neuritis. \n\nVomiting: Forceful ejection of food or fluid through the mouth from the stomach and, occasionally, the proximal duodenum. The term applies to those animals with overt evidence of effort associated with the expulsion of food and is characterized by vigorous abdominal pressing, arched back, gagging or retching, and hypersalivation. Projectile vomiting is the term used to describe the violent ejection of stomach contents without nausea or retching. Regurgitation, on the other hand, denotes expulsion of food or fluid from the esophagus and is a considerably more passive act than in vomiting.\n\nNote: Cough-induced gagging associated with tracheitis or tracheobronchitis is often accompanied by the expulsion of mucus from the respiratory tract and can be a forceful act. As such, productive coughs may appear to the owner to be vomiting.\n\nVomiting is a complex reflex that entails coordination of the GI tract, musculoskeletal system, and nervous system. Although the CNS vomiting center initiates vomiting, it must first be stimulated. Even when vomiting is drug induced, stimulation of the vomiting center is accomplished subsequent to stimulation of a medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone that forwards impulses to the vomiting center. Many sensory nerves can mediate emetic impulses. Therefore, intense pain (especially abdominal); nervous (psychogenic) stimuli; disagreeable odors, tastes, and smells; sensations from the labyrinth and pharyngeal areas; various toxins and drugs; and, presumably, the retention of metabolic waste products all may lead to vomiting. Numerous receptors for vomiting are located in the abdominal viscera, especially the duodenum. Afferent nerve fibers are found in the vagal and sympathetic nerves.\n\nVomiting can be quite debilitating. When excessive, it causes severe extracellular fluid deficits, particularly of sodium, potassium, and chloride ions and water. Loss of mainly gastric contents results in loss of hydrogen ions, a high serum bicarbonate concentration, and metabolic alkalosis. Vomited material from the proximal intestinal tract contains high concentrations of bicarbonate.\n\nClinically, vomiting should be addressed as a problem that originates from the GI tract (primary causes) or from causes outside the GI tract (i.e., metabolic causes [secondary]).\n\nDepending on the underlying cause, vomiting may be associated with a number of significant clinical signs. Primary causes of vomiting are generally associated with other GI signs, such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, obvious foreign bodies (e.g., a linear foreign body entrapped proximally under the tongue), ingestion of known irritant materials or drugs, hematochezia, or palpable abdominal tumors. Animals with metabolic or secondary causes of vomiting may appear lethargic, anorectic, and weak, particularly when the vomiting episodes have been sustained for several days. In some animals, polyuria or polydipsia, anuria, icterus, cough, and anemia are present.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC PLANS DIAGNOSTIC PLANS (Figure 3-6) "}
