{"title": "Vaccination with single plasmid DNA encoding IL-12 and antigens of 2 severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus elicits complete 3 protection in IFNAR knockout mice Republic of Korea Author summary 57", "body": "leukocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia [3, 4] . Disease mortality of SFTS patients has been 88 estimated to be 5 ~ 20% [3] . Even though the majority of SFTS cases has been reported from 89 China [3] , Korea [4] , and Japan [5] , SFTSV infections in southern Asia, including Vietnam, 90 have been recently reported in a retrospective survey [6] . Currently, no specific viral therapy 91 nor vaccine is available. An effective vaccine is needed to combat its relatively high mortality, 92 especially in elderly patients, and spread of SFTSV between humans [7, 8] . 93 Vaccine development for SFTS is at an early discovery phase and there have only been a few 94 studies on vaccine candidates using animal infection models [8] [9] [10] [11] . Immunization of NS 95 antigen with Freund's adjuvant in C57BL/6 mice, which are naturally resistant to SFTSV but 96 partially mimic human infections [12] , failed to enhance viral clearance, although it induced The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/787879 doi: bioRxiv preprint 5 103 attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) vaccine expressing the SFTSV 104 Gn/Gc glycoproteins elicited high titers of protective neutralizing antibodies in both wild type 105 and interferon \u03b1/\u03b2 receptor knockout (IFNAR KO) mice [11] . They clearly showed that a 106 single dose rVSV carrying SFTSV Gn/Gc could provide complete protection against lethal 107 challenge with SFTSV in young and old IFNAR KO mice, a promising infection model for 108 severe human infection of SFTSV [11, 13, 14] . Nevertheless, the potential role of cellular 109 immunity against the viral antigens in complete protection was not examined in this study, 110 although adoptive transfer of immune sera from mice immunized with rVSV-Gn/Gc to na\u00efve 111 IFNAR KO mice provide partial (~ 60%) protection against lethal SFTSV challenge [11] . 112 In this study, we developed a recombinant plasmid DNA (pSFTSV) encoding extracellular 113 domains of Gn and Gc, and NP-NS fusion antigen as a DNA vaccine candidate. We 114 examined whether it could provide protective immunity against lethal SFTSV infection in 115 IFNAR KO mice. In order to facilitate the processing and presentation of the SFTSV antigens 116 by dendritic cells (DCs) and enhance antigen-specific T cell responses, these recombinant 117 antigens were fused with Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 ligand (Flt3L) [15, 16] . Moreover, we 118 generated a recombinant DNA encoding IL-12\uf061 and \uf062 in addition to the recombinant viral 119 antigens (pSFTSV-IL12) to further enhance cell-mediated immunity [17] . Vaccination of 120 pSFTSV-IL12 provided complete protection of IFNAR KO mice upon lethal SFTSV 121 challenge, whereas immunization with pSFTSV elicits only partial protection, indicating that 122 antigen-specific cellular immune responses enhanced by co-expression of IL-12 could play a 123 significant role in protection against lethal SFTSV infection. We confirmed significantly 124 higher levels of Gn and NP-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses in mice vaccinated with 125 pSFTSV-IL12 when compared to those in mock vector-immunized mice. Therefore, our 126 results indicate that enhanced antigen-specific T cell immunity against multiple SFTVS In order to generate plasmids for DNA vaccination, genes encoding ectodomains of Gn, Gc 141 (from Genebank accession no. AJO16082.1), and NP/NS fusion protein (from Genebank 142 accession no. AJO16088.1 and AKI34298.1, respectively) were synthesized (GenScript, 143 Piscataway, NJ, USA) and cloned into pGX27 vector (Genexine, Seongnam, Republic of 144 Korea). All these genes were fused with signal peptide of tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA, 145 Uniport no. P00750) and Flt3L (Uniport no. P49771) in their N-terminus [15] (pSFTSV, Fig   146   1 ). In addition, murine IL-12\u03b1 and \u03b2 genes (Uniport no. P43432) [17] were also synthesized 147 (GenScript) and cloned into pSFTSV (pSFTSV-IL-12, Fig 1) .\n\nTo confirm the expression of cloned genes in pSFTSV and pSFTSV-IL12, HEK 293T cells Overexpressed recombinant proteins in supernatants were purified by AKTA start affinity confirmed by ELISA and immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2) . All the viral antigens were detected 312 in cell culture supernatants, as well as in cellular lysates (Fig. 2B) . KO mice to a Korean SFTSV isolate was examined by inoculating the mice with 1 x 10 1 to 1 375 x 10 5 FFU (S3 Fig A) . Upon infection, all the mice gradually lost body weight and became 376 moribund from the third to fifth day after infection, depending on the infection dose. All the 377 infected mice died at 5 ~ 9 d after infection (S3 Fig A) . Similar survival kinetics were 378 previously reported in IFNAR KO mice infected with other SFTSV strains [11, 14] , 379 indicating that our Korean SFTSV isolate possesses an equivalent degree of virulence to prior 380 Chinese isolates. The platelet counts in mice infected with 1 x 10 5 FFU of SFTSV 381 significantly declined up to 4 d after infection, and the mean platelet volumes of the infected 382 mice were significantly higher than those of control animals (S3 Fig B) , suggesting that 383 platelet destruction and the activation of platelet production simultaneously occur during 384 lethal infection [14] .\n\nTo assess the protective efficacy of the DNA vaccine, groups of mice were immunized with .

All the mock-immunized mice 388 expired by 5 d after SFTSV infection. In contrast, all the mice immunized with pSFTSV-IL12 389 were protected from lethal viral challenge, and 40% (2 of 5) of mice vaccinated with pSFTSV 390 survived (Fig. 4A) . Consistently, pSFTSV-IL12-vaccinated animals lost weight until 4 d after vaccinated mice (mean \u00b1 S.D. = 4.2 \u00d7 10 6 \u00b1 4.6 \u00d7 10 6 ) were approximately five and fifty 402 times lower than those of pSFTSV-vaccinated mice (mean \u00b1 S.D. = 2.1 \u00d7 10 7 \u00b1 1.7 \u00d7 10 7 ) 403 and vector-immunized mice (mean \u00b1 S.D. = 2.0 \u00d7 10 8 \u00b1 1.9 \u00d7 10 8 ) at 4 d, respectively. Given that immunization with Gn-Fc and Gc-Fc proteins can induce specific antibodies in 478 IFNAR KO mice (Fig. 5) Flt3L can significantly enhance CD8 T cell responses when fused with a target antigen and 484 promote persistent maintenance of antigen-specific CD8 T cells in vivo [16, 29] . In this study, 485 we also observed significant enhancement of Gn and NP-specific CD8 T cell responses, as 486 well as CD4 T cells, in the presence of IL-12 expression ( Fig. 3B and C) , which correlated "}
