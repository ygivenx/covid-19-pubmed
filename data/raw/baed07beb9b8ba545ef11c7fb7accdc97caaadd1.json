{"title": "In vitro Transcription and Capping of Gaussia Luciferase mRNA Followed by HeLa Cell Transfection", "body": "In the method described below, the T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit from NEB is used to synthesize capped and uncapped RNA transcripts of Gaussia luciferase (GLuc) and Cypridina luciferase (CLuc). A portion of the uncapped GLuc RNA is capped using the Vaccinia Capping System (NEB). A linearized plasmid containing the GLuc or CLuc gene and T7 promoter is used as the template DNA. The transcribed RNA is transfected into HeLa cells and cell culture supernatants are assayed for luciferase activity. Capped CLuc RNA is used as the internal control to normalize GLuc expression.\n\nThe video component of this article can be found at http://www.jove.com/video/3702/ Protocol RNases are commonly present on skin, hair, dust, laboratory surfaces, solutions, etc. Wear gloves and clean bench surface, pipettes etc. thoroughly before use to avoid RNase contamination. Use of nuclease-free pipette tips, tubes, glassware and reagents is strongly recommended.\n\nThe DNA template for the transcription reaction is a linearized plasmid containing the Gaussia luciferase gene and a T7 promoter upstream of the coding sequence ( Figure 1B) . \n\nAssay the supernatant from each well for GLuc activity using the BioLux Gaussia Luciferase Assay Kit as follows:\n\nLuminescence is measured using the Centro LB 960 microplate luminometer from Berthold Technologies.\n\nAssay the supernatant from each well for CLuc activity using the BioLux Cypridina Luciferase Assay Kit as follows:\n\nLuminescence is measured using the Centro LB 960 microplate luminometer from Berthold Technologies.\n\nThe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit can produce up to 180 \u03bcg uncapped RNA and 40 to 50 \u03bcg of capped RNA per 20 \u03bcl reaction. When analyzed on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, good quality, intact RNA should show a single, sharp peak representing the RNA transcript. A broad peak or multiple peaks indicate RNA degradation. It is also important to verify the size of the RNA. RNA transcripts of a longer length than expected may be due to incomplete digestion of the template plasmid DNA. RNA degradation and lower yield are usually a result of contaminants introduced into the reaction from the template DNA. Figure 2 is an example of the electropherogram and gel image obtained after running high quality, intact RNA on the Bioanalyzer.\n\nTransfection of HeLa cells with both capped and uncapped GLuc RNA is followed by incubation and assaying cell culture supernatants for luciferase activity. The 5' cap structure is important for protecting the RNA against exonuclease degradation 8 and for promoting translation initiation 9 of the mRNA. Therefore, RNA capping is an essential step for transfection experiments. The co-transcriptional (cap analog) method yields approximately 40 \u03bcg RNA that is 80% capped. The protocol utilizing Vaccinia capping enzyme caps up to 10 \u03bcg RNA (100 nt or larger) per reaction with nearly 100% efficiency. Figure 4 depicts the difference in luciferase expression between cultures transfected with capped and uncapped RNA samples. It can be clearly seen that cell cultures transfected with capped RNA show much higher expression of luciferase as compared to those transfected with uncapped RNA (which show no luciferase activity). In addition, Figure 4 also validates that both capping techniques, using cap analog and using the Vaccinia capping enzyme, successfully produce functional, capped RNA transcripts that can be translated into protein. The two tailed p-value obtained from the t-test was 0.2583 which indicates that there is no significant statistical difference between the luminescence data from the two capping methods. * Luminescence from untransfected cells was subtracted from GLuc and CLuc values before normalization.\n\nBioLux is a trademark of New England Biolabs, Inc.\n\nTransIT is a registered trademark of Mirus Bio LLC.\n\nMEGAclear is a trademark of Ambion.\n\nIn vitro transcription is a useful method for obtaining high yields of RNA for a variety of applications. The major advantage of using the T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit is that its formulation has been optimized to achieve high yields of RNA. In addition, the reagents provided in the kit are free of contaminating nucleases, resulting in synthesis of high quality, intact RNA transcripts. The kit is designed for high stability and flexibility such that it can be used for synthesizing mRNA, dye labeled RNA, high specific activity radiolabeled probes and capped RNA. The kit manual includes a list of specific protocols and additional materials required for each of these applications. It also includes technical information on using PCR products and synthetic DNA oligonucleotides as templates for transcription. It is important to note that the transcription kit can only utilize DNA templates containing a T7 promoter.\n\nThe method described in this article demonstrates post-transcriptional RNA capping using Vaccinia capping enzyme, as well as co-transcriptional capping using RNA cap structure analog. We have shown that both methods synthesize capped RNA that is functionally active post-transfection. The 5' cap structure improves stability of the RNA and translation efficiency, and hence is important for microinjection 11 and transfection 7 experiments. The co-transcriptional capping method generates 40-50 \u03bcg of~80% capped RNA. It is important to note that using 3'-0-Me-m 7 G(5')ppp(5')G RNA cap analog (ARCA), which is blocked at the 3'-hydroxyl of the m 7 G ensures incorporation of the cap in the correct orientation 17 . To cap larger quantities of RNA it is possible to scale up the standard reactions for both capping methods. However, using the Vaccinia Capping System would be a more feasible option cost-wise since co-transcriptional capping utilizes cap analog, which is a relatively expensive component. The Vaccinia Capping System is also a better method since it has capping efficiency of almost 100%.\n\nThe RNA capping methods described above synthesize RNA with a cap 0 structure at the 5' end. Cap 1 structure involves additional methylation at the 2'-O position of the ribose sugar of the first nucleotide at the ' end of the RNA. The cap 1 structure has been reported to enhance RNA translation efficiency 18 and can be incorporated by using 2'-O-Methyltransferase 20, 21 .\n\nThe method described in this paper can be used to transcribe, cap and transfect any desired mRNA. The luciferases GLuc and CLuc were specifically used in this protocol due to their many advantages. They are directly secreted into the cell medium, therefore avoiding need for cell lysis. Also, they generate high bioluminescent signal intensity, and the activity assays are highly sensitive and easy to perform. It is important to note that the GLuc expression in the cells can be influenced by various factors other than the functionality of the RNA itself. Some examples are pipetting errors, varying cell numbers per well, transfection efficiency etc. Data normalization is used to account for these factors. In our protocol, we co-transfect CLuc RNA as an internal control with the GLuc RNA. When GLuc luminescence is divided by the CLuc control values, it gets normalized for the errors and variability in transfection 19 ."}
