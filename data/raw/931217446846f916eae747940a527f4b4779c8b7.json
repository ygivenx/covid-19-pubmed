{"title": "Evaluation of single and dual siRNAs targeting rabies virus glycoprotein and nucleoprotein genes for inhibition of virus multiplication in vitro", "body": "Rabies is a fatal zoonotic disease caused by virus belonging to the genus Lyssavirus, family Rhabdoviridae, order Mononegavirales. In addition to its victims among domestic and wild animals, the disease is responsible for 50,000-55,000 human deaths per year in Asia and Africa [1] . Rabies virus (RV), after infection inside the body, enters to the central nervous system, leading to acute encephalomyelitis. Once the clinical symptoms specific to disease are initiated, the chances for survival are very poor. Pre-and post-exposure vaccinations are the most efficient and highly recommended methods for the prevention of disease in human as well as in animals [1, 2] . Sometimes, due to unnoticed exposure or vaccination failure, disease is diagnosed after the onset of clinical symptoms, and death becomes unavoidable due to the unavailability of any effective line of treatment. Considering the fatal nature of clinical rabies, efforts are being made to develop a postexposure treatment strategy that could inhibit the multiplication of virus inside the cell and the spread of infection to uninfected nervous cells without damaging them. A recently discovered endogenous mechanism called 'RNA interference (RNAi)' has been used in the past decade to inhibit virus multiplication through potent and efficient sequence-specific gene targeting.\n\nFirst described in 1998, RNAi mediates post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) in a sequence-dependent manner through short (*21-23 nucleotides long) RNA molecules called small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). siR-NA, along with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) forms an activated complex that specifically recognises and binds to complementary mRNA. The mRNA is then cleaved into smaller fragments, inactivating its expression [3] . This mechanism of gene silencing is highly conserved in plants, fungi, worms, insects and mammals [see refs. 4-6 for review]. Along with inhibition of gene expression, the endogenous cellular mechanism of RNAi performs multiple biological functions such as mediating the cellular response to viral infections, controlling the mobility of transposable genetic elements, and regulation of gene expression during animal development [see ref. 7 for review]. RNAi-based gene silencing of target genes has generated ample opportunities for therapeutic applications against various diseases and disorders. In the process of development of antiviral therapeutics, sequence-specific knockdown of viral genes that are indispensable for replication and pathogenesis has generated special interest. RNAi-based antiviral strategies have been developed for many RNA Recent investigations have shown that inhibition of RV multiplication can be achieved through RNAi targeting of the RV nucleoprotein (N) gene [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] both in vitro and in vivo. Silencing of other RV genes, such as the phosphoprotein (P) [11] and polymerase (L) genes [12] , has also resulted in some degree of anti-rabies effect. These results suggest that targeting single RV gene might not be sufficient to achieve absolute inhibition of RV multiplication. Another RV gene, the glycoprotein (G) gene, which has a crucial role in pathogenesis by controlling the rate of virus uptake into cells, trans-synaptic virus spread and virus replication during infection [16] [17] [18] [19] , could be a target for RNAi against rabies. To our knowledge, there is no published report on evaluation of siRNAs targeting the RV-G gene till now. However, siRNA targeting the G genes of other viruses of the family Rhabdoviridae has been evaluated for inhibition of virus multiplication [20, 21] .\n\nIn the present study, siRNAs targeting RV-G were designed and evaluated for inhibition of RV multiplication in vitro in BHK-21 cells. Furthermore, as a dual gene silencing approach, an siRNA with a considerable effect against RV-G was evaluated in combination with an siRNA targeting the RV-N gene for its anti-rabies-virus effect in vitro in BHK-21 cells.\n\nBaby hamster kidney-21 (BHK-21) and human embryonic kidney-293 (HEK-293) cell lines were procured from National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune, India, and grown at 37\u00b0C under 5 % CO 2 in Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium (DMEM, Hyclone), supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (Hyclone).\n\nThe mouse-brain-adapted rabies challenge virus standard 11 (CVS-11) strain was used to amplify RV genes by RT-PCR. The RV Pasteur virus 11 (PV-11) strain, adapted to BHK-21 cells, was used for in vitro challenge in BHK-21 cells.\n\nThe target gene reporter plasmids pDsRed-G and pDsRed-N were constructed for expressing the RV-G and RV-N proteins, respectively, with a red fluorescent protein (RFP) fusion at the C-terminal end. For construction of pDsRed-G, a 1572-bp full-length RV-G gene was amplified by RT-PCR with primers (Table 1) , using cDNA prepared from total RNA isolated using RV-CVS-11-infected mouse brain and cloned in the pDsRed-N1 vector (Clontech) between in NheI and BamHI sites. Similarly, pDsRed-N was constructed by amplifying the 1380-bp full-length RV-N gene by RT-PCR using primers (Table 1 ) and cloned in the pDsRed-N1 vector between HindIII and BamHI sites.\n\nConstruction of single and dual small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) expression plasmids siRNA sequences targeting a conserved region of the RV-G gene (GenBank accession no. AJ506997) were designed using different algorithms available online from IDT, Dharmacon, siDirect, Whitehead Institute, GeneScript and Invitrogen and selected on the basis of sequence motif and thermodynamics guidelines [22] . Each siRNA candidate sequence was compared to a unique and comprehensive EST/mRNA collection from humans and mice using BLAST to avoid possible unwanted off-target effects. Nine siRNA sequences targeting the RV-G gene were selected for the study ( Table 2 ). One siRNA targeting the RV-N gene, reported earlier, was included in this study [11] . All siRNA target sequences were synthesized as sense and antisense oligonucleotides along with restriction endonuclease cohesive ends (Table 3 ), annealed and cloned as shRNA into an siRNA plasmid expression vector (psi-C) between BamHI and XhoI, sites under the control of a U6 promoter. One scrambled siRNA with no homology to the RV genome was cloned as a negative control siRNA. The recombinant plasmids, named, psi-G1 to 9, psi-N and psi-C, were characterized by restriction endonuclease analysis and nucleotide sequencing.\n\nFor construction of a dual-gene-targeting siRNA expression plasmid, the most efficient siRNAs targeting RV-G (si-G7) and RV-N (si-N) were selected. The siRNA expression cassette targeting the RV-N gene was isolated from the psi-N plasmid with NotI (blunt) and XbaI cohesive ends and cloned into the psi-G7 plasmid into XhoI (blunt) and XbaI sites. The resultant plasmid (psi-G7N) consisted of two siRNAs expression cassettes expressing siRNAs against both the RV-G and RV-N genes. The psi-G7N plasmid was characterized by restriction endonuclease analysis and nucleotide sequencing.\n\nTo select siRNAs effectively targeting RV-G or N mRNAs, HEK-293 cells were transiently co-transfected at a 1:2 ratio with target reporter gene plasmid encoding either RV-G or N fused with red fluorescent protein (RFP) and silencing plasmid encoding gene-specific siRNAs (psi-G1 to 9) or psi-N or negative control siRNA (psi-C). HEK-293 cells were grown to 80-90 % confluence in a 24-well plate and co-transfected using Lipofectomine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). At 48 h post-transfection, the transfected cells were analyzed for RFP expression using an Olympus IX51 fluorescent microscope with an UMNG2 (RFP) filter.\n\nThe efficiency of the dual-gene-targeting siRNA expression plasmid (psi-G7N) was evaluated using a transient plasmid co-transfection method against RV-G and N gene transcripts. Briefly, HEK-293 cells were co-transfected with psi-G7N plasmid and either the RV-G target gene expression plasmid (pDsRed-G) or the RV-N target gene expression plasmid (pDsRed-N) and analysed for RFP expression at 48 h post-transfection. The single-gene-targeting siRNA expression plasmids (psi-G7 or psi-N) and control siRNA expression plasmid (psi-C) were included as controls. For quantitative estimation of the amount of RV-G mRNA in co-transfected HEK-293 cells, real-time PCR was performed. Briefly, the total RNAs were isolated using Trizol LS reagent (Invitrogen) from HEK-293 cells co-transfected with different siRNAs expressing plasmids and target gene reporter plasmid at 48 h post-transfection, and gene transcripts in the total RNA preparation were reverse transcribed into cDNAs using an oligo dT primer and RevertAid M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (Fermentas) following manufacturer's protocol. The RV-G-RFP gene transcripts in 1:10-diluted cDNAs were quantified using gene-specific real-time primers (Table 1 ) using a KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Kit (Kapa Biosystems) following the manufacturer's instructions. The percent reduction in RV-G gene transcript levels in siRNAs targeting RV-G treated cells compared to control was determined after normalization with GAPDH gene transcripts following the method described earlier [23] .\n\nThe efficiency with which different siRNAs inhibited RV multiplication was evaluated in vitro by transfection of BHK-21 cells with siRNA-expressing plasmids and challenge with a BHK-21-adapted RV PV-11 strain. Briefly, BHK-21 cells were grown to 80-90 % confluence in a 24-well plate and transfected using Lipofectomine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) with different siRNAexpressing plasmids and infected with RV PV-11 at an MOI of 0.01. At 48 h postinfection, the infected cell culture supernatant was harvested and stored at -80\u00b0C for virus titer determination. The infected cell monolayer was fixed with 80 % acetone, and RV in infected cells was detected by direct fluorescent antibody staining using an FITC-labeled antibody against rabies virus nucleocapsid (BioRad) using the method of the OIE for the fluorescent focus unit (ffu) assay [24] . Cell nuclei were counterstained with Prolong gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). The RV titer in infected cell culture supernatant harvested at 48 h postinfection was determined by ffu assay. Briefly, serial tenfold dilutions of virus supernatant were mixed with 1 9 10 4 BHK-21 cells in a flat-bottom 96-well plate in triplicate and incubated at 37\u00b0C. Two days after infection, infected cells were fixed with 80 % acetone, and plaques were visualized after staining with an FITClabeled antibody against the rabies virus nucleocapsid, and the ffu titer was determined. \n\nTo evaluate the silencing effect of siRNAs targeting the RV-G gene, HEK-293 cells were transiently co-transfected with nine different siRNA expression plasmids (psi-G1 to 9) and target gene reporter plasmids (pDsRed-G). The RFP-tagged version of the RV-G fusion protein was detected in all transfected cells (Fig. 1) . However, cells containing the RV-G gene targeting siRNAs showed a silencing effect as reduction in red fluorescence (indicating reduction in target gene expression) compared to control (co-transfected with negative control siRNA). This confirmed that there was expression of siRNA, which effectively silenced the target RV-G gene in a gene-specific manner. Three siRNA expression plasmids, named psi-G1, psi-G2 and psi-G7, expressing siRNAs targeting the RV-G gene, were effective in knockdown of RV-G-RFP fusion protein expression compared to other siRNAs, including control siRNA (Fig. 1) . For quantitative evaluation of siRNAs, levels of RV-G-RFP transcripts in different co-transfected HEK-293 cells were quantified by real-time PCR. The levels of RV-G-RFP transcripts in three independent experiments demonstrated that one siRNA (si-G7) could efficiently knock down the RV-G transcripts. The greatest reduction in the amount of RV-G-RFP transcript (64.5 \u00b1 1.3 %) was observed with psi-G7; however, the effect was less pronounced with psi-G1 (38.3 \u00b1 1.4 %) and psi-G2 (46.5 \u00b1 1.7 %) ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). This indicated that all the three siRNAs (si-G1, si-G2 and si-G7) were effective in reducing the levels of target RV-G transcripts (RV-G-RFP); however, the knockdown effect was stronger with si-G7.\n\nTo assess the effectiveness of siRNAs expressed by plasmids to inhibit RV multiplication, BHK-21 cells were transfected with siRNA-expressing plasmids and challenged with the RV-PV-11 strain. The presence of RV after fluorescent focus staining revealed that the reduction in RV multiplication was higher with psi-G7 than with the other siRNAs ( Supplementary Fig. 2) . To estimate the inhibitory effect of siRNAs more precisely, their ability to limit infectious virus production was analyzed by determining the RV ffu count in infected cell culture supernatant. The psi-G1-, psi-G2-and psi-G7-treated BHK-21 cells showed RV titers of 8.3 \u00b1 0.8 9 10 2 , 5.6 \u00b1 0.8 9 10 2 and 4.6 \u00b1 0.8 9 10 2 ffu/ml of RV, respectively. These results are the average of four independent experiments. Collectively, there was an 86.8 \u00b1 8.8 % reduction in RV ffu count with siRNA si-G7, while the reduction was 74.7 \u00b1 10.5 % and 78.7 \u00b1 6.9 % with the siRNAs si-G1 and si-G2, respectively ( Supplementary Fig. 3) .\n\nSilencing effect of a dual-gene-targeting siRNAs expression plasmid\n\nThe dual-gene-targeting siRNA expression plasmid (psi-G7N) expressing si-G7 and si-N siRNAs targeting the RV-G and N genes, respectively, was analysed for its gene silencing effect and compared with single-gene-targeting siRNA (psi-G or psi-N) and control siRNA (psi-C). The reduction in red fluorescence with cells transfected with psi-G7N compared to cells transfected with psi-G, psi-N or psi-C indicated that psi-G7N, expressing dual siRNAs (si-G7 and si-N), was able to decrease the expression of both the target genes (RV-G and N) (Fig. 2) .\n\nTo analyse the effect of the dual-gene-targeting siRNA expression plasmid on RV multiplication, BHK-21 cells were transfected with psi-G7N and challenged with the RV PV-11 strain. There was a reduction in RV fluorescent foci in cells treated with either single (si-G7 or si-N)-or dual (si-G7N)-gene-targeting siRNAs compared with control siRNA, indicating inhibition of RV multiplication (Fig. 3) .\n\nFor quantitative estimation of the gene silencing effect, RV titers were determined in supernatants of BHK-21 cells that had been treated with single-and dual-gene-targeting siRNAs and challenged with RV. All the siRNAs expressing plasmids, in four independent experiments, were capable of causing a reduction in RV titer compared to the control (Fig. 4) . The reduction in RV titer was 87.4 \u00b1 10.6 %, 86.8 \u00b1 8.8 % and 85.9 \u00b1 16.5 % with psi-G7N, psi-G7 and psi-N, respectively. This clearly indicated that both si-G7 and si-N, in single and dual form, could inhibit RV multiplication in BHK-21 cells.\n\nRV has an approximately 12-kb-long single-stranded RNA genome consisting of nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M), glycoprotein (G) and large polymerase (L) genes that encode proteins, namely N, P, M and G and L. Among the five RV proteins, the N, P and L proteins are important targets for RNAi due to their role in both viral transcription and replication. Previous in vitro studies have indicated that short RV-N cDNA, artificial microRNAs and synthetic siRNA targeting RV-N could interfere with RV replication [10, 11, 15] . Other targets for RV RNAi were non-structural genes such as P [11] and L [13] with limited antiviral potential. Our group has also evaluated siRNAs targeting RV-L and N genes delivered using an adenoviral vector for their anti-rabies-virus potential in vitro in BHK-siRNAs targeting rabies virus G and N genes 2327 21 cells and in vivo in mice and showed that they provided a moderate level of protection against lethal RV-CVS-11 challenge [12] . RV-G also remained a potential target for RNAi, as it is essential for trans-synaptic spread of RV between neurons in vivo [16, 17] . In the present study, different strains were identified and used for designing siR-NAs. While selecting siRNAs, a conserved region of the RV-G gene with no potential for secondary structure formation was considered using siRNA design algorithms. Since screening of siRNAs against RV is tedious and time-consuming and requires intense safety conditions, a simple method for screening siRNAs based on plasmid co-transfection was used. The siRNAs (siG-1 to 9) targeting RV-G and si-N targeting RV-N genes were synthesized in an shRNA form and cloned into an siRNA expression vector under the control of a U6 promoter. To facilitate screening of effective siRNAs, we constructed the target reporter plasmids pDsRed-G and pDsRed-N, in which full-length RV-G and N coding regions containing siRNAs target sequences were fused in-frame with the RFP gene to express the fusion proteins RV-G-RFP and RV-N-RFP. The siRNAs that executed cleavage of the viral mRNA led to reduced expression of the RFP reporter gene. This provided a simple and impartial model for assessing the efficacy of gene silencing by analysis of fusion protein expression by fluorescence microscopy. In three independent experiments, the siRNAs (si-G7 and si-N) consistently inhibited expression of the RFP fusion versions of the RV-G and N protein, indicating that they are potent siRNAs that should be studied further. This approach of screening effective siRNAs targeting different viral genes has been reported previously [12, 20, [25] [26] [27] [28] . siRNA-mediated gene silencing functions by degrading mRNA that shares a complementary sequence; therefore, targeting RV-N, also resulted in a reduction (85.9 %) in release of infectious RV compared to control. This indicated that both siRNAs, namely, si-G7 and si-N, could inhibit RV multiplication in BHK-21 cells. The reduced infectivity titer of RV due to RV-G silencing could be due to the production of RV without RV-G, which might have restricted its spread from one infected cell to another. A requirement for RV-G in cell-to-cell transfer of virus has been reported [16, [29] [30] [31] .\n\nSimilarly, a reduction in RV titer with a silencing effect on RV-N could occur in two ways: as a major viral structural protein and as a regulatory protein to switch from viral gene expression to genome replication. The intracellular ratio of leader RNA to N protein regulates the switch from viral gene transcription to viral genome replication [32] .\n\nTo analyse the cumulative effect of both of the siRNAs (si-G7 and si-N) on RV gene expression and multiplication, an siRNA expression plasmid encoding dual siRNAs under the independent control of an U6 promoter was constructed. The functionality of siRNAs to knock down the expression of RV-G and N genes was analysed using a plasmid co-transfection approach, which indicated that a dual-siRNA-expressing plasmid could reduce the expression of both the target genes. Furthermore, a dual gene silencing construct also inhibited the multiplication of RV in infected BHK-21 cells as analysed by in vitro challenge of siRNAs-treated cells with RV-PV-11. The reduction in RV titer in the infected cell culture supernatant was 87.4 %, which was significantly similar to the effect produced by individual siRNAs, indicating no cumulative effect. The approach of using multigene siRNAs or multi-siRNAs/miRNAs targeting a single gene has been reported for many viruses, with a variable degree of inhibition of virus replication [11, [33] [34] [35] .\n\nThe results of this study indicated that siRNAs (si-G7 and si-N) targeting RV-G and N genes in single and dual form were effective in inhibiting RV multiplication in BHK-21 cells. This also suggested that siRNAs targeting RV-G and N can be used as antiviral agent against RV infection. However, before recommending them for therapeutic use, much work on targeted delivery, dose and time of therapeutic siRNAs administration is needed. "}
