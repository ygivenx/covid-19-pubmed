{"title": "Expression and Purification of the scFv from Hybridoma Cells Secreting a Monoclonal Antibody Against S Protein of PEDV", "body": "P orcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly contagious, enteric disease of swine caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which is characterized by severe enteritis, vomiting, watery diarrhea, and weight loss. PEDV has a substantial detrimental effect on the swine industry due to its high mortality rates among suckling piglets. (1) (2) (3) Since PED was first reported in Belgium and the United Kingdom in 1978, many studies regarding PEDV have been carried out for the prevention of PED. (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) However, in recent years PEDV infections still exist and cause frequent occurrences of piglet diarrhea in many swine-raising provinces in China, leading to severe economic losses. (11) (12) (13) PEDV is a member of group 1a, genus Alphacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales. The size of its genome is approximately 28 kb, encoding three major structural proteins-spike protein (S), membrane protein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N). Of these, the S protein plays an important role in induction of neutralizing antibodies, receptor binding, and cell membrane fusion. (14, 15) These properties make the S protein a suitable target for the development of antiviral agents.\n\nIn a previous study, the monoclonal antibody (MAb) 6E6 was prepared by hybridoma technique using a truncated recombinant S protein of PEDV as an immunogen. (7) Further research revealed that the MAb 6E6 was capable of recognizing the native S protein of PEDV with a high affinity. The single-chain fragment variable (scFv) is a small, engineered antibody in which the variable light chain (VL) and heavy chain (VH) of the antibody are connected by a short polypeptide linker. At present, the scFv molecule is considered a powerful tool for therapeutic antigen targeting in vivo. (16, 17) In the current study, the scFv gene was obtained from the hybridoma cell 6E6 secreting the monoclonal antibody against S protein of PEDV. After cloning, the framework regions and complementarity determining regions of the scFv gene were analyzed on the basis of the deduced amino acid sequences. The recombinant scFv protein was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli using the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-6p-1 with a GST-tag. Moreover, the high-purity recombinant scFv protein was produced through a simple gelcutting procedure followed by electroelution and dialysis. Our aim is to reveal the basic sequence information of the MAb 6E6 and develop a practical procedure for the preparation of scFv to facilitate further antiviral research.\n\nThe hybridoma cell of the MAb 6E6 against PEDV S protein was kindly provided by the Division of Swine Infectious Diseases, National Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology (Harbin Veterinary Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China). (7) Escherichia coli Rosetta\u00d4 (DE3) plysS cells were obtained from Novagen (Madison, WI). Escherichia coli DH5a cells were 1 prepared using the calcium chloride method and stored at -80\u00b0C.\n\nThe primers for PCR amplification of the VL and VH genes of the MAb 6E6 were designed according to the degenerate primers described by Wang and associates. (18) The 5\u00a2 ends of the VH forward primers and VL reverse primers were modified to include BamH I and Xho I sites, respectively. In order to splice the genes VL and VH, a complementary overlapping sequence encoding a flexible linker of 12 amino acids (SSGGGGSGGGGS) was added to the 5\u00a2 ends of the VH reverse primers and VL forward primers, respectively. Detailed primer information is shown in Table 1 .\n\nTotal RNA was prepared from the hybridoma cells of the MAb 6E6 against S protein of PEDV using the reagent Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Using the extracted RNA as templates, the first strand cDNA synthesis was carried out using the Orient-Express Oligo (dT) cDNA Synthesis Kit (Novagen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nThe VL and VH genes of the MAb 6E6 were respectively amplified by conventional PCR using synthesized cDNA as a common template. Briefly, the PCR reaction was performed in a 25 mL mixture containing 400 nmol of each forward and reverse primer, 1 mL cDNA template, 0.25 mmol each dNTP mixture (Takara, Dalian, China), 10 \u00b7 buffer, and 0.5 U ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara). The amplification conditions comprised an initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 30 PCR cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 52\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s, and a final extension step of 72\u00b0C for 10 min. The amplified products of the VL and VH genes were purified using the Qiaquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).\n\nUsing the purified VL and VH genes as templates, an overlap extension PCR (SOE-PCR) was performed for generation of the scFv gene of the MAb 6E6 (scFv/6E6). Briefly, the SOE-PCR reaction contained 100 ng of purified VL products and 100 ng of purified VH products, 0.25 mmol each dNTP mixture, 10 \u00b7 buffer, and 0.5 U ExTaq DNA polymerase. 35 PCR cycles were performed as follows: 95\u00b0C for 1 min, 50\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min, and a final extension step of 72\u00b0C for 10 min.\n\nProkaryotic expression of scFv/6E6 gene After the scFv/6E6 gene was digested using the restriction endonucleases BamH I and Xho I, the cohesive ligation of the scFv/6E6 gene with the vector pGEX-6p-1 was carried out using T4 DNA Ligase (Novagen, San Diego, CA) at 16\u00b0C for 12 h. The ligation products were transformed into E. coli DH5a cells, and the positive plasmids were selected to determine the sequence of the scFv/6E6 gene. Sequence analysis of the framework regions (FR) and complementarity determining regions (CDR) of the scFv/6E6 gene was carried out using the IMGT/V-QUEST program v3.2.20 of the international immunogenetics information system (available at www.imgt .org/IMGT_vquest/share/textes). The recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coli Rosetta (DE3) plysS cells, and the recombinant bacteria were induced using 1.0 mM isopropyl b-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) at 37\u00b0C for 4 h. The induced recombinant bacteria were analyzed by 12% SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).\n\nThe inclusion body of the recombinant scFv/6E6 protein was extracted from the lysate of the IPTG-induced host bacteria processed by supersonic waves. The extracted inclusion body proteins were treated with 2 \u00b7 SDS loading buffer and then separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with the reagent RAPIDstain TM (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The protein band of the recombinant scFv/6E6 protein was cut from the stained gel. The gel-cutting band containing the recombinant scFv/6E6 protein was loaded into the D-Tube\u00d4 Dialyzer Mini with MWCO 12-14 kDa (Merck), and 2.5 mL of tris-glycine SDS running buffer was added to the loaded tube. The electroelution of the loaded tube was run in a horizontal electrophoresis chamber (Beijing Liuyi Instrument Factory, Beijing, China) at 100 V for 1.5 h at room temperature in the tris-glycine SDS running buffer. After the electroelution, the dialysis of the loaded tube containing the recombinant scFv/6E6 protein was performed in 1 L of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for 3 h. The purified recombinant scFv/ 6E6 protein was collected from the dialysis tube and stored at -80\u00b0C.\n\nTo verify the recombinant scFv/6E6 protein expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) plysS cells, Western blot analysis was performed using the following procedures. The purified scFv/6E6 protein was subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (NC) using a semidry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The NC membrane was blocked using 5% (W/V) non-fat dried milk in \n\nPBS at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, and incubated with mouse monoclonal antibody against the GST-tag (1:1000 dilution in PBS) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. After washing three times with PBST, the NC membrane was incubated with IRDye TM 700DX-conjugated affinity purified anti-mouse IgG (H&L, goat, 1:8000 dilution in PBS) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. After washing three times with PBST, the results of the Western blot were analyzed using the ODYSSEY\u00d4 Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE).\n\nThe VH and VL genes were amplified at about 360 and 400 bp by PCR using the cDNA from the hybridoma cells 6E6 as a template, and then *750 bp size of the scFv/6E6 gene was generated by SOE-PCR (Fig. 1) . The nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acid sequences of four FRs and three CDRs of the H and L chains in the scFv/6E6 gene are shown in Table 2 . Sequence analysis indicated that the VH gene of the scFv/6E6 gene showed 88.41% nucleotide identity with mouse immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene (Genbank accession no. AF305910), and the VL gene of the scFv/6E6 gene showed 85.67% nucleotide identity with mouse immunoglobulin kappa light chain variable region gene (Genbank accession no. AF003294).\n\nAfter cloning the scFv/6E6 gene into prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-6p-1, the recombinant scFv/6E6 protein was successfully expressed at a high level in Escherichia coli; its molecular weight was approximately 50 kDa (Fig. 2) . The high-purity recombinant scFv/6E6 protein was obtained by simple gel-cutting purification followed by electroelution and dialysis (Fig. 3) .\n\nTo further verify the recombinant scFv/6E6 protein, the Western blot analysis was performed using the monoclonal antibody against GST-tag. The result revealed that the recombinant scFv/6E6 protein fused with GST-tag showed a strong reaction with the monoclonal antibody against GST-tag, and the specific reaction band was found to be about 50 kDa in size (Fig. 4) .\n\nThe use of antibody is a powerful therapeutic tool against viral infections. (19, 20) During the past decade, advances in recombinant antibody technology have led to the development of a large variety of engineered antibody molecules for research, diagnosis, and therapy with specificities out of reach of conventional antibody technology. Of these, scFv is the smallest unit of immunoglobulin molecule functioning in antigen-binding activities. In comparison to the parental antibody, scFv molecules have several advantages in clinical practices, including better penetration, lower immunogenicity, and therapeutic antigen targeting in vivo, as well as the ability to facilitate mass production in vitro. At present, numerous scFvs have been constructed against hapten, protein, carbohydrate, receptor, tumor antigen, and viruses. All these scFvs demonstrate good potential for use in several fields, including medical therapies and diagnostic applications. (21) (22) (23) (24) In our study, the scFv gene of the MAb 6E6 against PEDV S protein was cloned from its hybridoma cells. Sequence analysis demonstrated that the VH and VL genes of the scFv/6E6 gene were composed of four framework regions (FRs) and three complementarity determining regions (CDRs); they showed high identity with the VH and VL (kappa) genes of mouse immunoglobulin published in GenBank. Many studies have proven that the scFv genes from different antibodies were successfully expressed in prokaryotic expression system \n\nZHU ET AL.\n\nusing Escherichia coli as host cells. (25) At the beginning of this study, the prokaryotic expression vectors pET-32a with Histag had been selected to express the scFv/6E6 gene. However, we did not obtain a positive expression of the scFv gene. Moreover, the vector pGEX-6p-1 was used in an attempt to generate the recombinant protein of the scFv/6E6 gene. The results demonstrated that the scFv/6E6 gene was expressed in Escherichia coli through the fusion effect of the GST-tag. It had been proved that the vector pGEX-6p-1 showed significant efficacy in the expression of leukotoxin of Fusobacterium necrophorum. (26) The prokaryotic expression system has several advantages, including easy culture, rapid cell growth, low cost, high yield, and relatively short expression time. However, if the expressed protein is required for functional studies, the prokaryotic system shows a problem as most proteins become insoluble in inclusion bodies, which are very difficult to recover as functional proteins. Thus, purification of the inclusion bodies protein is a key step for prokaryotic expression system. Gel-cutting purification of the inclusion body protein has been proven to be a simple, time-saving, and much less expensive means in several studies. (9, 10) Additionally, gelcutting purification is capable of facilitating the preparation of high-purity recombinant proteins in vitro. However, it is difficult to remove the sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) completely from the cutting-gel purified proteins through the conventional protein dialysis. In our study, the D-Tube Dialyzer was used for electroelution and dialysis of the recombinant scFv/ 6E6 protein from polyacrylamide gels. The procedure efficiently recovers proteins and simultaneously removes ampholytes from proteins. The purified proteins are compatible with most downstream applications such as animal immunization for antibody production and functional assays. In addition, the RAPIDstain reagent, instead of potassium chloride staining, improved the sensitivity of the gel staining and simplified the experimental operation of the cutting-gel purification. In Western blot analysis, the recombinant scFv/ 6E6 protein was conformed using the monoclonal antibody against GST-tag, and the specific reaction band was found in *50 kDa. This result provided further evidence that the scFv protein (*25 kDa) was correctly fused to the GST-tag (*26 kDa) of the vector pGEX-6p-1.\n\nIn conclusion, we cloned the scFv gene from the hybridoma cells of the MAb 6E6 against PEDV S protein and expressed the recombinant scFv/6E6 protein in E. coli using the vector pGEX-6p-1 with GST-tag. Moreover, a simple purification method, combining cutting-gel purification with electroelution and dialysis, was used for purification of the recombinant scFv/6E6 protein. This study will provide a basis for further antiviral research of PEDV."}
