{"title": "Respiratory Viruses and Atypical Bacteria Co-Infection in Children with Acute Respiratory Infection", "body": "Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are one of the prevalent pediatric diseases all over the world. In children below five years [1] [2] [3], acute respiratory infections are responsible for 18\u201333% of all deaths. Unfortunately, more than half of this mortality is recorded among developing countries as low social level and malnutrition double the burden [2] [3] [4].\n\nAcute respiratory infections can be caused by pathogens like bacteria, viruses, fungal and atypical bacteria include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and respiratory viruses (influenza A and B, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza) [5] [6].\n\nAlthough viruses are usually the main responsible for most of both upper and lower acute respiratory infections (ARIs) [7], but studies documented that patients may be infected with both bacterial and viral pathogens, making it difficult to identify the clinical characteristics that allow the physician to differentiate viral disease from bacterial disease in the early course of the disease [8].\n\nRecently, many new emerging respiratory viruses have been identified including human coronavirus (HCoV), NL63 [9] and human bocavirus (HBoV) [10]. Moreover, various emerging respiratory viruses led to epidemics and pandemic (H1N1) virus infection and H5N1 [11].\n\nAtypical pathogens Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila are considered important agents are causing mild, moderate, or even severe acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in children worldwide [12].\n\nThis study aimed to determine the prevalence of co-infection distribution between respiratory pathogens including viruses and atypical bacteria among a well cohort of febrile children presenting by acute respiratory tract infections symptoms.\n\nThe study followed the regulations of the medical ethical committee of the Cairo University and the medical ethical committee of the National Research Centre and. Signed informed consents were collected from legal child guardian before participation after explaining the purpose of the study.\n\nAny child presented with Influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms the chest clinic Abo El Rish Pediatric Hospital, Cairo University was considered eligible. ILI was defined according to CDC criteria as having measured fever > 38\u00b0C and cough and/or a sore throat [13].\n\nAny child receiving immunosuppressive therapy started antibiotic therapy, children with chronic lung diseases and patients who were unwilling to participate in this study were excluded from the study.\n\nData were collected by a self-designed questionnaire include demographic data, risk factors (smoking, passive smoking and contact with birds). Throat washes and nasal swabs were collected from each child as appropriate.\n\nA throat wash was taken from each child when appropriate, in the case of a young infant throat swab was taken instead.\n\nSpecimens then were cultured on blood agar, chocolate agar, MacConkey agar and Sabarauds dextrose agar (Oxoid Co. England). Isolates were identified by conventional methods such as culture characteristics and biochemical reactions.\n\nNasopharyngeal swabs were taken from each participant by measuring the distance between the ear lobule and the ala nasi by the NP swab and divided by 2, and the swab marked at this distance to ensure the insertion of the swab in the proper site. This flexible, sterile tip flocked with nylon fibre swab applicator was inserted into the nostril and back to the nasopharynx and left in place for a few seconds. It was then slowly withdrawn with a rotating motion. The swab was placed in a 15 mL centrifuge tube labelled with the unique patient ID and containing 2 mL viral transport media (VTM: consisting of a sterile solution of bovine albumin fraction V, HEPES buffer, penicillin and streptomycin in HANK\u2019s balanced salt solution). The applicator stick was then cut off.\n\nThe received swabs inside the 15 ml tube were agitated vigorously for 10 seconds using a vortex mixer to free cells from the swab tip, and then swab was removed from the tube and discarded using a forceps. The VTM was immediately placed in a freezer (-70\u00b0C) until tested with PCR for the presence of respiratory viruses. If samples are positive for Influenza A, then further testing was performed by PCR to determine if the virus is a seasonal influenza variant or swine H1N1 2009 virus.\n\nViral Nucleic Acid Extraction: Viral Nucleic acid extraction was done after centrifugation of the sample for 10-20 min and 200ul from the sediment taking as starting material using the QIAamp\u00ae Viral RNA Mini cat number 52904 according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Elution was done with 60ul buffer AVE, and reelution step was added to increase the nucleic acid concentration.\n\nCDNe was done using 15ul from the extracted RNA, for only the testing of the following RNA viruses (Rhinovirus, Influenza, RSV and HMPV). For Adenovirus conventional PCR testing was done directly from the extracted nucleic acid (DNA). The kit used for complementary DNA synthesis was Sensifast cDNA (cat# BIO-65054).\n\nPCR: Conventional PCR was done by 3 different reactions for each sample as follows for the following viruses:\n\nMonoplex PCR for Rhinovirus testing using primers sequence, concentrations and conditions as [14]Monoplex PCR for Adenovirus testing using primers sequence, concentrations and conditions as [14]Multiplex PCR for InfA, InfB, HMPV and RSV testing from the following work [15] (Table 1).\n\n\n\nData were coded and entered using the statistical package SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 23. Data were summarised using mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum in quantitative data and using frequency (count) and relative frequency (percentage)\n\nThe study was conducted from first June 2016 to June 2017. 132 children presented by ILI were enrolled in the study selected from Pediatric Hospital Cairo University. 57 (43.2%) were males, and 75 (56.8%) were females.\n\nThe age of patients ranged from 1month-10 years (120 months) with a mean age of 2.95 \u00b1 2.46 years (Table 2), this study was designed to estimate the prevalence of respiratory pathogens in 132 children presented with ARI. Overall, samples from 114 individuals (86.3%) were found to be positive for at least one pathogen, and 18 of them were positive for two or more pathogens. Rhinovirus was the most commonly detected agent, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n\nViral etiological agents were detected in 78 cases (59.09%), while 54 patients (40.9%) had no definite viral aetiology. The most abundant virus detected was Rhinovirus in 36 (27.3%), followed by 21 (15.9%) were positive for RSV, 12 (9.1%) were positive for HMPV, 6 (4.5%) were positive for adenovirus and 3 (2.3%) were positive for influenza B (Table 3).\n\nBacterial agents were detected in 49 cases (37.1%), Klebsiella was detected in 17 (12.9%) child followed by Enterobacter in 11 (8.3%), Pseudomonas spp. 11 (8.3%), Acinetobacter 9 (6.8%) and Klebsiella and Enterobacter co-infection in one child (0.8%).\n\nFor Atypical bacterial causes, Mycoplasma was positive for 9 (6.8%) cases, and one case was positive for Bordetella parapertussis (Table 3).\n\nViral and atypical bacteria Co infection were detected in 14 cases illustrated in Table 4.\n\nSmall sample size and a low number of co-infection cases preclude any robust statistical analysis."}
