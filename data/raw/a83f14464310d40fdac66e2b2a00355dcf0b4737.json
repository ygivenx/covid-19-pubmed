{"title": "", "body": ". Protein multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of mAKAP7\u03b3 and eukaryotic homologs. MSA DAA52752 .1, respectively. Alignment was performed with the T-Coffee Expresso, which incorporates known protein database structures to aid alignment, with all MSA options selected (pcma_msa, mafft_msa, clustalw_msa, dialigntx_msa, poa_msa, muscle_msa, probcons_msa, t_coffee_msa, amap_msa, kalign_msa, fsa_msa, mus4_msa) to ensure high confidence in the alignment (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . To convey confidence in the alignment, scores indicate the percent agreement between all MSA algorithms utilized in the analysis for each protein and for the consensus sequence. Additionally, color-coding indicates positional confidence of each aligned residue based on agreement between MSA algorithms with blue indicating the least and red indicating the greatest confidence in the alignment. Conservation of sequence is indicated by Clustal MSA symbols in the consensus line (cons) with \"*\" indicating fully conserved, \":\" strong conservation of properties and \".\" weak conservation of properties. Boxes indicate predicted nuclear localization signals (blue) (6) (7) (8) , catalytic HxT motifs (yellow) and PKA RII-binding domain (black) (9) ."}
