Commentary: Donor lungs allocated to critically-ill patients listed urgently: no longer a waste of precious organs?", "body": "should be listed at all. A limitation of the study acknowledged by the authors is the 51 unknown proportion of patients that were not referred or were not listed for LTx at all. 52\n\nThe results presented in this paper therefore represent only a portion of well-selected 53 patients believed to be still transplantable with a reasonable outcome. Series on 54\n\nsuccessfull LTx in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome e.g. following a 55 serious viral infection are rarely reported. 5,6 56\n\nIn our LTx program at the University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium we have been 57 very reluctant to list patients with acute pulmonary deterioration who were previously not 58 seen in clinic or not screened for transplantation. Nevertheless such patients are always 59 discussed and evaluated by a multidisciplinary team on an ad hoc and case-by-case basis. 60\n\nYoung patients who survive the critical period in the intensive care unit and who can be 61 rehabilitated may still be considered for elective transplantation in case their pulmonary 62 function and exercise capacity remain limited without any other medical or surgical 63 options for further improvement. As discussed in the ISHLT consensus document 2 , these 64 patients will need careful re-evaluation to determine candidacy for LTx taking into 65 account not only physiologic findings, but also psychosocial factors, family support, and 66 fully informed patient consent that cannot always be obtained upon referral when 67 critically ill. 68 personnel, the sole ethical principle in organ allocation remaining valid is patient's 70 autonomy. However that day, transplant physicians would no longer be triggered by a 71 scarcity of transplantable organs to continue the inspiring ethics debate on a fair lung 72 allocation policy. 73"}
