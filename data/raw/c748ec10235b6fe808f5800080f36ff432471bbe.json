Notably, the physician workforce is not only at risk of losing time spent in clinical care due to these exposures, but at a personal risk from severe disease that requires hospitalization and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Notably, physicians 60 years of age and older are at a particularly elevated risk, with 80% of deaths in China concentrated in this age group. 3, 4 In the early experience in the US, nearly half of all hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions, and nearly 80% of deaths have occurred in this age group as well. 4 To address the potential impact of excluding physicians with a high risk of adverse outcomes based on age, we evaluated the current patterns of age of licensed physicians across the United States.\n\nWe used the 2018 database of physicians from Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) that includes all actively licensed physicians across the US. 5 The FSMB maintains a database of all licensed physicians in each of the states and US territories compiled during the licensing process, which are sampled biennially and publicly reported. 5 We extracted publicly available summary data for the physician age in 5-year age bins, nationally and across each of the states. Both at a national and the state-level, we used descriptive statistics for the age distribution of physicians and assessed the .

We used Stata 16 (College Station, TX) for all analyses. were 60 years of age or older. Notably, states of North Dakota (n=1180) and Vermont (n = 1215) had the lowest and California (n=50786) and New York (n=31582) the highest number of physicians over the age of 60 years (Figure 1 ). Across states, the median proportion of physicians aged 60 years and older was 28.9% (IQR, 27.2%, 31.4%), and ranged between 25.9% for Nebraska to 32.6% for New Mexico (Figure 2 ).\n\nNearly 1 in 3 licensed physicians in the US and each of the states are over the age of 60 years, representing nearly 300,000 currently licensed physicians in the US.\n\nPhysicians in the states of California and New York -the two states with the largest outbreaks of COVID-19 also have the highest number of physicians 60 years or older.\n\nThe study has certain limitations. We do not have information on the specialty expertise of physicians, as some physicians may be more prone to encountering patients with COVID-19. However, as many individuals in the community may be .

Further, we are unable to identify the health status of physicians that may modify their risk or make some younger physicians vulnerable. Finally, physicians may be licensed in more than one state. National estimates, however, represent the number of unique physicians.\n\nIn conclusion, older physicians represent a large proportion of the US physician workforce, particularly in states with the worst COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, their exclusion from patient care will be impractical. Optimizing care practices by limiting direct patient contact of physicians vulnerable to adverse outcomes from COVID-19, potentially by expanding their participation in telehealth may be a strategy to protect them. .
