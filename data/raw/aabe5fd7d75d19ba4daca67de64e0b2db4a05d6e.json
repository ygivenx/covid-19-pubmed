{"title": "Synthesis of fluorinated acyclic nucleoside phosphonates with 5-azacytosine base moiety", "body": "The chemistry of acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (ANPs) is a key research topic of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry in Prague. The importance of these compounds lies in their biological activities, especially antiviral [1e4] . Three compounds of this class have already became commercially available drugs: cidofovir for the treatment of human cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in AIDS patients; adefovir in its prodrug form adefovir dipivoxil for the treatment of hepatitis B (HBV); and tenofovir, either as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, or more recently (since 2015) also as a new prodrug form tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), for the treatment of HIV and HBV infections [5] . The introduction of tenofovir to the market had a crucial influence on the transformation of HIV/AIDS from a mortal threat to a manageable chronic disease [6] . Besides, long-term systematic investigation of ANPs has enabled the development of many other therapeutically promising structures, which have been synthesised but have never advanced to the stage of preclinical/clinical investigations. Among others, this concerns fluorinated purine 3-fluoro-2-[(phosphonomethoxy)propyl] derivatives [7] and acyclic nucleoside phosphonates with 5-azacytosine base moiety [8e10]. 5-Azacytosine ANPs were originally synthesised with the aim to search for new epigenetic (hypomethylating) agents; contrary to 5azacytosine nucleosides (azacitidine, decitabine), however, this activity has not been found. It is evident that the presence of the sugar moiety is essential for this effect [11] . On the other hand, we found a new class of antiviral agents selective against DNA viruses. The lead compound of this group is 5-azacytosine analogue of cidofovir, 1-(S)-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]-5-azacytosine, HPMP-5-azaC (Fig. 1 ). In comparison with cidofovir, its antiviral activity data are similar, but the toxicity profile is more favourable, with the selectivity index (the ratio of the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) to the 50% effective concentration (EC 50 )) being 2-to 16-fold higher than that of cidofovir [8] . The antiviral activity of HPMP-5-azaC has been increased many times by the transformation to ester prodrugs derived from its cyclic form [9] .\n\nThe only disadvantage of HPMP-5-azaC is its rather complicated metabolic profile caused by its chemical (and also enzymatic) instability [12, 13] . Therefore, the compound was finally not advanced to the stage of clinical investigations. Other 5-azacytosine ANPs have better stability but they are either inactive or their antiviral activity is only marginal. Interestingly, some of them, e.g. 2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl derivative exhibited antiviral activity when converted into appropriate prodrugs [10] .\n\nIn this study, we investigate a new type of 5-azacytosine ANPs modified with fluorine at the acyclic part. Fluorinated derivatives, especially nucleoside and nucleotide analogues are compounds of great interest [14] . An introduction of the fluorine atom into biologically active molecules often leads to remarkable changes in their physical, biological, and pharmacokinetic properties due to its electronegativity, size, omniphobicity or lipophilicity and electrostatic interactions [15] . In clinical practice, fluorinated nucleosides are utilised as effective cytostatics (e.g. gemcitabine) or antivirals (trifluridine, sofosbuvir) [16, 17] . Within the group of ANPs, 3-fluoro-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl (FPMP) derivatives have been identified as potent and selective inhibitors of retroviruses. The adenine derivative, (S)-9-[3-fluoro-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl] adenine, ((S)-FPMPA) exhibits even better in vivo anti-HIV and anti-HBV parameters than adefovir. The activity against HIV is also known for both enantiomers of 9-[3-fluoro-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]-2,6-diaminopurine (FPMPDAP) and its guanine counterpart [7, 18] . Structures of these compounds are depicted in Fig. 2 .\n\nThis paper describes the synthesis and biological activities of side-chain fluorinated analogues of HPMP-5-azaC and their derivatives with further modifications on the base moiety. These modifications have been designed with the aim to stabilise the 5azacytosine ring.\n\nMoreover, it must be taken into account that ANPs as compounds bearing (a) free phosphonate group(s) have a polar character responsible for their limited intracellular delivery and low oral bioavailability. The usual way to overcome this problem is the transformation of such compounds to appropriate prodrugs. The most frequently used ANP prodrugs are acyloxyalkyl (pivaloyloxymethyl, POM), alkyloxyalkyl, S-acylthioethyl (SATE), aryl, cyclic 1aryl-1,3-propanyl and cyclosaligenyl phophonate esters, phosphoramidates bearing amino acid esters and proTides [19] . Despite promising in vitro or in vivo studies, only a few of them have been proceeded into clinical trials. This can be attributed to the difficulty of the achievement of the right prodrug property balance, in particular suitable chemical stability, rate of conversion, safety with respect to by-products, the avoidance of stereoisomers, adequate physical properties (the ability to crystallise, solubility), and the ability to synthesize substantial quantities. The synthesis of ANP prodrugs and the investigation of their pharmacological properties have been the subject of many reviews [20, 21] .\n\nRegarding the above-mentioned facts, the transformation of our new structures to prodrug forms is an integral part of this work.\n\nThe most logical method of the preparation of FPMP-5-azaC reveals direct condensation of the sodium salt of 5-azacytosine with an appropriate fluorinated precursor. Such a reactive precursor can be (S)-2-[(diisopropoxyphosphoryl)methoxy)-3-fluoropropyl p-toluenesulphonate (FPMP synthon, 1) or its methanesulphonyl analogue. The synthon approach has already been reported for the preparation of purine FPMP derivatives by Jindrich et al. [22] Their synthesis started from protected 5 0 -Oribonolactone and included as many as nine reaction steps. Another, more efficient synthesis of FPMP synthons utilises enantiomeric fluorohydrines accessible from commercially available Otritylated glycidols by reaction with potassium hydrogen difluoride [23] . In our present work, we have investigated the fluorination of (R)-3-benzyloxy-2-[(diisopropylphosphoryl)methoxy)]propanol (3), a compound utilised in our laboratory as a common starting material for the preparation of 3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy) propyl derivatives. This synthon is accessible on a large scale by a three-step synthesis from (S)-2-(trityloxymethyl)oxirane (2) (Scheme 1) [24] .\n\nOur first experiments with the fluorination of 3 were carried out via previous activation of the hydroxyl group, e.g. by the reaction with p-toluenesulphonyl chloride [25] . Although the reaction of tosylate 4, formed in this way, with tetrabutylammonium fluoride proceeded satisfactorily, the total preparative yield of the fluoro derivative 5 was not high because of the complicated and laborious isolation and purification of the tosylate intermediate.\n\nAn alternative way is the direct fluorination of the hydroxy derivative 3. This approach has never been explored in the area of ANP synthons whose synthesis is usually performed as a large-scale multi-step process without the isolation of intermediates. The fluorination reagents generally used for the substitution of hydroxy groups are DAST [26] , Olah's reagent [27] , and fluoroalkylamine reagents [28] .\n\nWe have recently described perfluorobutane-1-sulphonyl fluoride as a nucleophilic fluorination reagent for the preparation of thymidine phosphorylase inhibitors (S) and (R)-1-[3-fluoro-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]thymines (FPMPT) [29e31]. Unlike various strongly corrosive reagents, e.g. DAST or deoxofluor, perfluorobutane-1-sulphonyl fluoride is stable, only little moisturesensitive and easy to handle. Its use for the direct fluorination of ANPs is known only from for several examples. In the above mentioned FPMPT synthesis, the appropriate starting material was the 3-hydroxy-2-[(phosphonomethoxy)propyl] derivative of 4-Omethoxy-5-methylpyrimidinone (not thymine). The reason is that these fluorinations are sensitive to the presence of acidic hydrogen atoms in the starting molecule. For example, the performance of the same reaction with the diisopropyl ester of HPMPT (containing NH at the position 3 of the thymine moiety), results in elimination under basic conditions resulting in a six-membered ring closure through the side-chain hydroxy group [29] . Similarly, this fluorination method also fails with cytosine derivatives (HPMPC). An important aspect of syntheses with perfluorobutane-1-sulphonyl fluoride is the selection of reaction conditions: base and solvent [32] . The base should be a good proton acceptor with low nucleophilicity and moderate basicity to avoid elimination. It the preparation of fluoro derivative 5 from (R)-3-benzyloxy-2-[(diisopropylphosphoryl)methoxy)]propanol (3), we chose between Nethylpiperidine (NEP) and 1,8-diazabicyclo [5.4 .0]undec-7-ene (DBU). The reaction with NEP had been reported to provide better results in the syntheses of fluorinated nucleosides [32] , but the preparation of our FPMP precursor proceeded satisfactory using DBU. The reaction was carried out in toluene, initially at room temperature. Although the yields of 5 were 42e50% the reaction rate was slow. A significant decrease of reaction time was achieved by heating to 90 C. Full conversion was observed when DBU was added for a few hours (3e4 h). The course of fluorination reaction with NEP was worse and required excess of perfluorobutanesulphonyl fluoride (90% conversion after 9 h). The final FPMP synthon, (S)-2-[(diisopropoxyphosphoryl)methoxy)-3-fluoropropyl p-toluenesulphonate (1), was obtained from 5 by the removal of a benzyl group via catalytic hydrogenation to give intermediate 6 which was further subjected to tosylation (Scheme 1).\n\nThe condensation of (S)-2-[(diisopropoxyphosphoryl) methoxy)-3-fluoropropyl p-toluenesulphonate (1) with a sodium salt of 5-azacytosine (7) was performed by heating in N,N-dimethylformamide with catalytic amount of caesium carbonate. Reaction afforded a mixture of N 1 and O 2 regioisomers 8a and 8b, whose ratio depended on the reaction time (Scheme 2). The highest regioselectivity was observed when 5-azacytosine sodium salt was heated with phosphonate 1 at 120 C for 11 h. In this case, only N 1isomer 8a was detected but its preparative yield was low (28%). Further extension of the reaction time resulted in increased formation of O 2 -isomer 8b. After 24 h at 120 C, the ratio of regioisomers 8a:8b was 7:4 while their preparative yields were 28% (8a) and 16% (8b). Regarding these observations, it is obvious that the alkylation is a balanced process and the desired N 1 -isomer is formed as a product possessing kinetic stability. The final product, free phosphonic acid 9 (FPMP-5-azaC) was obtained from diisopropyl ester 8a by the standard procedure of deprotection by bromotrimethylsilane followed by hydrolysis.\n\nIn order to have also its prodrug form available for antiviral screening we selected its phosphoramidate prodrug 11. The synthesis was performed by the modified procedure originally developed by Jansa [33] based on the reaction of diisopropyl ester 8a with bromotrimethylsilane, first giving the intermediary bis(trimethylsilyl) ester 10. This intermediate can be converted without isolation to the desired bis(amidate) 11 by a reaction with an appropriate amino acid ester activated by 2,2 0 -dithiopyridine (Aldrithiol\u2122) and triphenylphosphine (Scheme 3). A direct reaction of 9 with ethyl L-alanine, Aldrithiol\u2122 and triphenylphosphine was not successful, giving the desired bis(amidate) 11 in low yields only, together with a number of by-products.\n\nA significant problem of 5-azacytosine compounds is their hydrolytic instability which substantially compromise their pharmaceutical potential [11e13]. This instability is caused by the electron deficiency in position 6 of the triazine ring, where the imineresembling carbon could be easily attacked by a nucleophile, e.g. an hydroxyl ion, accompanied by the cleavage of the ring [11, 12] . On the other hand, the conversion of 5-azacytosine compounds into their 5,6-dihydro-5-azacytosine counterparts with sp 3 -hybridisied carbon (CH 2 ) at the position 6, leads to the compounds which are hydrolytically stable. Nucleosides modified in this way, e.g. 5,6dihydro-5-azacytidine and 2 0 -deoxy-5,6-dihydro-5-azacytidine, still preserve their antitumor and hypomethylating activities. They are lower in comparison with the original 5-azacytosine derivatives but the compounds are less toxic [11, 34] . In the field of ANPs, we previously reported the 5,6-dihydro derivative of HPMP-5-azaC ( Fig. 1) . The compound has preserved its anti-DNA virus activity (albeit lower than HPMP-5-azaC); nevertheless in contrast to HPMP-5-azaC, it also exhibits inhibitory activity against HCV replication, and is hydrolytically stable [8] .\n\nThe transformation of FPMP-5-azaC into the corresponding 5,6dihydro derivative 13 was carried out on the level of its diisopropyl ester 8a via catalytic hydrogenation. This step was followed by the deprotection of ester groups in the intermediate 12 using bromotrimethylsilane (Scheme 4).\n\nThe guanidine grouping of the 5,6-dihydro-5-azacytosine moiety provides a unique opportunity for the preparation of imidazo [1,2-a] [1, 3, 5] triazine derivatives e compounds with four hydrogenbonding sites bearing an annelated 5-membered imidazole ring. These analogues can be formed by reaction of 5,6-dihydro-5-azacytosine derivatives with appropriate carbonyl compounds. We have described the coupling of 5,6-dihydro-5-azacytosine phosphonate 12 with various 2-bromoacetophenones 14a-c. (Scheme 5). Although the desired annelated products 15a-c were formed in all cases, the imidazole imino group was found sensitive towards further alkylation with some 2-bromoacetophenones. When the compound 12 was treated with 2-bromoacetophenones 14b and 14c alkylated by-products 16b and 16c were isolated together with products 15b, and 15c. On the other hand, 2-bromoacetophenone 14a did not afford any further alkylated product.\n\nSurprisingly enough, a serious problem occurred in the deprotection of diisopropyl ester groups to the final phosphonic acids 17a-c. The usual way using bromotrimethylsilane completely failed, leading to a mixture of decomposition products. Another possibility was a microwave-assisted acid hydrolysis. This method of the transformation of phosphonate esters to free ANPs has been originally developed at the IOCB by Jansa and Hol\u00fd. This method is usually very clean and the isolation of products is easy [35, 36] . In our experiments, we hydrolysed 15a-c with two equivalents of HCl at 150 C for 5e15 min under micro-wave irradiation. Unfortunately, the ring of the triazine moiety opened and the C-6 methylene group was hydrolytically split off. This indicated the destabilisation of the 5,6-dihydro-5-azacytosine ring as a consequence of imidazole-triazine annelation. On the other hand, we had observed earlier that 5-azacytosine ANPs can have better stability in the cases when their phosphonic function is masked by an appropriate prodrug group [9, 11, 37] . Taking into account this finding, we selected another synthetic strategy starting from bis(amidate) prodrug of FPMP-5-azaC 11. Compound 11 can be easily reduced to the corresponding 5,6-dihydro form 18 which is then subjected to condensation reaction with 2-bromoacetophenones to form the desired annelated structures 19a-c in their prodrug forms (Scheme 6). The other way, Jansa's method [33] for the transformation of phosphonate ester 12 into phosphoramidate 18 doesn't take place. This may have been caused by the presence of acetic acid in the structure of 12. Condensation reactions using 2,2 0dipyridyldisulphide (Aldrithiol) and triphenylphosphine are known to proceed via a cyclic intermediate whose formation requires a proton coming from a nucleophile [38] (e.g. amino acid ester). It is possible that acetic acid preferentially protonates a pyridine unit of 2-thiopyridine which then cannot activate a nucleophile and phosphonate units.\n\nBesides FPMP derivatives, we also worked on the syntheses of 5azacytosine ANPs bearing gem-difluorinated arrangement by the method developed in our laboratory for purine gem-difluorinated ANPs [36] . Unfortunately, our effort failed because of the instability of the triazine ring during the deprotection of phosphonate ester groups (with bromotrimethylsilane as well as under microwave conditions).\n\nOn the other hand, ANPs with trifluoromethyl arrangement are known to be stable towards Lewis acids. Therefore, 5-azacytosine phosphonate 25 could be prepared quite easily (Scheme 7). To a first approximation, the compounds were prepared as racemates using cheap and easily accessible trifluoromethyloxirane. This approach is sufficient for the evaluation of the true biological potential of the compounds. If any biological activity were sought, pure enantiomers would have to be subsequently synthesised.\n\nThe synthesis is based on the treatment of 5-azacytosine (20) with trifluoromethyloxirane (21) followed by the reaction of the formed hydroxy derivative 22 with appropriate phosphonate synthon to give the desired phosphonate in the form of ester 24.\n\nFor this purpose, two phosphonate synthons were investigated. While the reaction with diisopropyl tosyloxymethanephosphonate and sodium hydride afforded only low yields of 24, the conversion increased substantially when more reactive diisopropyl bromomethanephosphonate and sodium tert-butoxide were used. In \n\nThe synthesised side-chain fluorinated analogues of HPMP-5-azaC were evaluated for their inhibitory activity against a wide range of DNA and RNA viruses: in human embryonic lung ( values that were about three times higher than those of the reference anti-HCMV drug ganciclovir without displaying cytotoxicity for HEL cells up to the highest concentration tested (100 mM). The compound 8a proved significantly less active against wild-type strains of HSV-1, HSV-2 and VZV than the reference drug acyclovir but was in contrast to acyclovir remained active against TK-deficient viruses. This derivative proved inactive against other DNA viruses such as vaccinia virus (poxvirus) and adenoviruses. Compound 22 (3,3,3-trifluoro-2-hydroxypropyl-5-azaC) showed marginal activity against herpesviruses and adenovirus 2 with EC 50 values in the range of 40e270 mM.\n\nSeveral synthetic strategies for side-chain fluorinated acyclic nucleotide analogues bearing 5-azacytosine and imidazo [1,2-a] [1, 3, 5] triazine base moieties have been developed. Highly polar free phosphonic acids were transformed into amidate prodrugs. All new compounds were subjected to the investigation of biological (antiviral) activities. Except for the FPMP 5-azaC diisopropyl ester (8a), which had some activity against human cytomegalovirus and herpesviruses and for 1-(3,3,3-trifluoro-2-hydroxypropyl)-5-azacytosine (22) with negligible activity against herpesviruses and adenovirus, none of the newly synthesised acyclic nucleoside analogues (ANPs) exhibited antiviral activity.\n\nUnless stated otherwise, solvents were evaporated at 40 C/ 2 kPa and compounds were dried at 13 Pa. Column chromatography was performed on silica gel 60 mm (Fluka). Analytical TLC was performed on silica gel 60 F 254 plates (Merck) in the solvent systems: chloroform-methanol 7:1 (S1), chloroform-methanol 7:2 (S2) and 10:1 (S3), ethyl acetate-acetone-ethanol-water 18:3:2:2 (S4) or 16:3:3:2 (S5), 2-propanol-25% aq. ammonia-water 7:1:2 (S6). \n\nStandard chemicals and ion-exchange resins were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Czech Republic).

Trifluoromethyloxirane was purchased from Fluorochem (Wesley Street, Old Glossop). Anhydrous solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Penta (Czech Republic).

Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID 50 of virus (1 CCID 50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or with 20 plaque forming units (PFU) and the cell cultures were incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity or plaque formation (VZV) was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virusinfected cell cultures that had not been treated with the test compounds. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC 50 or compound concentration required to reduce virus-induced cytopathicity or viral plaque formation by 50%.\n\nThe cytotoxicity of the tested compounds was expressed as the minimum cytotoxic concentration (MCC) or the compound concentration that caused a microscopically detectable alteration of cell morphology. Alternatively, the cytostatic activity of the test compounds was measured based on inhibition of cell growth. HEL cells were seeded at a rate of 5 \u00c2 10 3 cells/well into 96-well microtiter plates and allowed to proliferate for 24 h. Subsequently, a medium containing different concentrations of the test compounds was added. After three days of incubation at 37 C, the cell number was determined with a Coulter counter. The cytostatic concentration was calculated as the CC 50 , or the compound concentration required to reduce cell proliferation by 50% relative to the number of cells in the untreated controls.\n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest."}
