{"title": "BLOOD BIOCHEMICAL REFERENCE RANGES FOR SOWS UNDER MODERN MANAGEMENT CONDITIONS", "body": "Recently published reference ranges for blood biochemistry in swine generally relate to animals in experimental herds, and frequently only to animals less than 1 year old (e.g . Doornenbal et at., 1983 ; James et al., 1987) . In these studies the herds were either specific pathogen free or of inadequately specified disease status . Much earlier work (reviewed by Tumbleson et aL, 1986) , involved husbandry practices that are no longer current, results obtained by methods that are now outdated, or both . The ranges widely used in clinical practice (e .g . Blood et aL, 1983) reflect these inappropriate sources .\n\nWe present here reference ranges obtained by analysis of blood samples from a well defined population of commercial breeding sows using modern laboratory methods . The animals sampled were clinically healthy, conventionally managed sows at varying ages and differing stages of the breeding cycle, drawn from six breeding herds of known disease status on farms in eastern England . The values obtained are considered to represent valid reference ranges for healthy sows under modern husbandry conditions .\n\nPlasma samples were obtained in March, June, November and December 1986 from a total of 77 sows from five herds (herds 1-5 in Table I ) . Herd 1 was sampled on two occasions, different sows being used on each occasion . Sera were obtained from 11 sows in herd 6 (Table I) in November 1987 . The herds had Meat and Livestock Commission classification of Nucleus and/or Multiplier . Approximately 10% of the adult sows were sampled on each occasion . All pigs sampled were clinically normal, and were at varying stages of the reproductive cycle . The breeds involved are indicated in Table I . The herds were conventionally managed . Sows were loose-housed and bedded on straw during the dry period, in groups of 10-20 . Movement was only restricted by crating in the farrowing house (for approximately 4 weeks) and in stalls during the service period (approximately 5 weeks) . Sows were routinely vaccinated for erysipelas and treated twice yearly with anthelmintic in the feed .\n\nFeed was compounded on-farm and nutrient intake was adequate according to the current recommendations (Anon ., 1982) . The rations were based on cereals, primarily wheat or barley . Table I Breeding performance * For breeding and fattening herds (Ridgeon, 1988 \n\nWhere analytical results for more than 20 animals are available, the reference range for an analyte is given as the 2 .5th to 97 .5th intercentile range . If fewer than 20 results are available, the full range of measured values is given . Analysis of age-related changes is initially by product moment correlation, a probability level of P,<0 .01 being taken to indicate a significant correlation . All significant correlations are then confirmed by rank correlation, to reduce the effects of outliers . Comparison of age and gestation distributions is by unpaired Student's t-test, using the appropriate approximation whenever a significant variance ratio was determined (Snedecor & Cochran, 1967) . The following pig diseases were notifiable to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food under UK legislation at the time of sampling and none was present on these farms : anthrax, Aujeszky's disease, foot and mouth disease, rabies, swine fever (classical and African), swine vesicular disease, Teschen disease . \n\nSow condition was generally good in all herds . Thin sow syndrome was not observed, but several sows were over-fat . Breeding performance figures for each herd at the time of sampling are shown in Table I , and the disease status for each herd at this time is indicated in Table III , which shows the presence or absence of named diseases .\n\nThe distribution of ages for the 63 sows for which age was known is shown in Fig . 1 . The age range was 11-74 months, with a median of 24 months . There were no significant age differences between breed groups (Large Whites and crosses (n=24) versus the others (n=39), P=0 .7), nor was there any correlation of age with stage of gestation (r=0 .03, P=0 .8) . The distribution of stage of gestation is shown in Fig . 2 . The range was 0-14 weeks (median 5 weeks) . It is clear from Fig . 2 \n\nThe reference ranges for all plasma, serum and erythrocyte analytes measured are given in Table IV . The median value for each analyte is also shown, as an appropriat\u00e8 average' value for the population .\n\nSerum and plasma proteins The appearance of a typical serum protein electrophoretogram is shown in Fig . 3 . In each of the globulin bands (alpha, beta and gamma), only one protein peak is discernible . The concentrations of the globulin bands, derived from the electrophoretogram by densitometry, are given in Table IV . Protein concentrations were not significantly correlated with age (plasma total protein : r=0 .14, P=0 .3 ; serum total protein : r=-0 .23, P=0 .5 ; beta-and gamma-globulins : r=0 .30, P=0.4) .\n\nTrends related to age and gestational stage As correlation with age was performed for all 23 analytes, a more stringent definition of significance than that conventionally used was required, and was set at PS 0 .01 . On this basis, the plasma concentrations of three analytes were significantly correlated with age of the sow in the age range sampled . These were cholesterol (r=-0 .47, P=0 .0004, n=53), phosphate (r=-0 .52, P<0 .0001, n=63) and alkaline phosphatase (r=-0 .63, P<0 .0001, n=62) .\n\nValid correlation with stage of gestation could not be performed, since this variable was not randomly distributed over breed groups (Fig . 2) . to indicates the number of sows .\n\nPerformance figures for each herd may be compared with the national average for 1986 (Ridgeon, 1988) (Table I) . There is general agreement of the performance in each herd with the averages for all parameters reported, although there is some variation between the herds in age at weaning, and herd 6 shows a low percentage born dead . The detailed descriptions (Tables I and III ) of the performance and disease status of the population from which our samples were drawn provide unique confirmation of the validity of our reference ranges in the investigation of conventionally managed sows .\n\nThe reference ranges in Table IV The upper limit of the bilirubin range is four times that given by Blood et al. (1983 ), by Friendship et al (1984 ), and by Doornenbal et al. (1983 for piglets up to 4 months of age . Doornenbal et al. (1983) found higher values in pigs over 4 months of age . We consider that our findings may thus represent a more appropriate reference range for the adult sow .\n\nThe distribution of creatine kinase values was non-Gaussian, with a tail to high values . The top of the reference range was higher than those given by Blood et al. (1983) or by Reese et al. (1984) , but similar to the findings of Friendship et al. (1984) . The high values are presumed to result from muscle damage, a consequence of the problems of capture and restraint of farmed sows . Comparably high values have been recorded in periparturient sows (reported in Tumbleson et at, 1986) , in experimental young pigs subjected to constraint in slings (James et al., 1987) , and in pigs after experimental exercise (Doize et at, 1989) . Our values thus appear to constitute a more appropriate reference range than would be obtained from bleeding a group of animals more accustomed to handling .\n\nThe values for total plasma or serum protein were unexpectedly high when compared with published ranges (Blood et al., 1983 ; Reese et al, 1984 ; Tumbleson et al, 1986) , while the albumin levels were, on average, rather similar . This suggests higher immunoglobulin concentrations, which was confirmed by serum protein electrophoresis (Fig . 3 , Table IV ) . The gamma-globulin concentrations were higher than those previously reported (Blood et al., 1983 ; Tumbleson et al, 1986 ), but showed no age dependency in the age range sampled . Data reviewed in Tumbleson et al. (1986) supports the suggestion that swine 1 year old or more show higher serum total protein than younger animals . The 1-year-old stock described by Reese et al. (1984) have lower protein levels, but were specific pathogen free . Friendship et al. (1984) , studying pigs from weaning to maturity, observed serum protein values that increased with age, adult sows showing ranges similar to those that we describe . Thus, although our protein reference ranges differ markedly from those in current use, they may be considered as more appropriate values for conventionally managed sows .\n\nThe age-related changes in plasma phosphate and alkaline phosphatase are expected and are well recognized physiological trends, supported by other work (Doornenbal et al., 1983 ; Friendship et al., 1984 ; Tumbleson et al., 1986 ; James et al., 1987) . The fall in cholesterol concentration with age is consistent with the higher values found in younger animals as reported by others (Friendship et al., 1984 ; Tumbleson et al., 1986 ; James et al., 1987) .\n\nWe consider that the ranges we have given represent valid reference ranges for blood biochemistry in breeding sows of average productivity and disease status under modem husbandry conditions . Interpretation of abnormal values has been discussed by Wilson et al. (1972) , and is described in standard texts (e .g . Blood et al., 1983) ."}
