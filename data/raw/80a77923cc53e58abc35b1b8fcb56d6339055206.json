{"title": "Development and validation of a rapid, single-step reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) system potentially to be used for reliable and high-throughput screening of COVID-19", "body": "Primers showing optimal in-silico features were subjected to analytical sensitivity and 25 specificity to assess the limit of detection (LOD) and cross-reaction with closely-and distantly-26 related viral species, and clinically prominent bacterial and fungal species. In order to evaluate the 27 clinical utility, our RT-LAMP was subjected to a large number of clinical samples, including 213 28 negative and 47 positive patients, relative to two commercial quantitative RT-PCR assays. 29\n\nReport 48). As of March 17, 2020, COVID-19 cases are found in 150 countries/regions and infected 48 167,515 patients, among whom 6,606 died (World Health Organization, Situation Report 56). The 49 latest phylogenetic analysis studies designated the etiologic agent of COVID-19, SARS COV-2 (2). 50\n\nThe virulent nature of this virus and its high rate of transmissibility warrants robust, rapid, sensitive, 51 specific, and quantitative diagnostic tools to supplement clinical symptoms aiding clinicians to 52 confidently rule in and rule out patients. Moreover, such a diagnostic tool will help with preventing 53 spread of virus by identifying the infected cases and can monitor the health status of infected patients 54 by quantifying the viral load. Center for Disease Control was the first to develop a quantitative 55 reverse transcriptase real-time PCR (RT-PCR), which later became the gold standard technique 56 (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/testing.html). Subsequently, a Chinese group 57 used a RNA-based metagenomics next generation sequencing (mNGS) to diagnose the viral RNA 58 from the clinical samples of two patients (3). However, the requirement for advanced technology and 59 skilled personnel and long turn-around time (24 hours) are not feasible for local and referral 60 laboratories. Therefore, a colorimetric loop mediated isothermal amplification, also known as LAMP, 61 was developed to obviate the need for expensive technologies, e.g. real-time PCR and NGS, as well 62 as to shorten the turn-around time to up to 40 minutes (4). However, this assay was a qualitative one 63 and also only the swab samples from limited number of patients (n=7) were included for testing (4). 64\n\nMost recently a newer generation of single step RT-LAMP were developed to detect SARS COV-2, 65 but these assays were not challenged with real clinical samples obtained from COVID-19 positive 66 patients (5, 6). Therefore, we developed a sensitive, specific, and rapid RT-LAMP assay and its 67 performance was challenged by an extensive number of confirmed COVID-19 (n=47) and negative 68 patients (n=213) relative to qRT-PCR assays approved by two Chinese Food and Drug 69 Administration (qRT-PCR NMPA). Altogether, we present a rapid and reliable diagnostic tool that 70 potentially could be deployed for high-throughput screening applications in referral and local 71 laboratories. 72\n\nAll rights reserved.

Ltd, Guangzhou, China). RNA of pseudotyped virus 92 were extracted using EZ-10 Spin Column Viral Total RNA Extraction Kit (Sangon Biotech Co.,Ltd. 93 Shanghai, China). Serial dilutions with the magnitude of log10 containing 50*10 6 cell/ml to 50*10 0 94 cell/ml pseudotyped virus were performed to determine the limit of detection (LOD). Serial dilution 95 testing was performed in both RNase/DNase free molecular grade water and sputum sample collected 96 from a COVID-19 negative healthy individual. Reproducibility of our LAMP assay (linearity=R 2 97 value) was assessed by separate serial dilution testing on three occasions, each performed in duplicate. 98 All rights reserved.

LAMP incubation time was set to 60 109 minutes to observe both limit of detection and cross-reactivity (LAMP conditions are mentioned in 110 clinical evaluation section). The reaction endpoint time was set in a way to detect the lowest possible 111 copy number of virus without any cross-reaction. 112\n\nClinical samples obtained from patients contain a wide range of inhibitors impairing the efficacy of 114 diagnostic assay. Therefore, the tolerance of our LAMP assay was assessed when 500 copy/ml of 115 simulated viral particles were mixed with human blood, mucin, \u03b2 -adrenergic bronchodilator, Tamiflu, 116 dexamethasone, adrenaline. 117\n\nClinical validation engaged two clinical centers, namely The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying 119\n\nChildren's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China (Center one), and the Wuxi 120 All rights reserved.

Each center used a different qRT-NMPA 121 assay as a gold standard technique. SARS-CoV-2 kit from Shanghai BioGerm Medical 122 Biotechnology Co. Ltd, (NMPA approval number 20203400065, with LOD of 1000 copies/ml, Ct 123 cut-off 38), and a kit from DAAN Gene Co., Ltd (NMPA approval number 20203400063, with LOD 124 of 500 copies/ml, cut off Ct value of 40) were used in center one and center two, respectively. 125\n\nPositive patients were divided into two groups by physicians, namely suspected and confirmed. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi. org/10.1101 org/10. /2020 The whole workflow of our study from in-silico analysis to analytical evaluation and clinical 143 validation is depicted in Figure 1 . Nine and six LAMP primer systems were designed and evaluated 144 in-silico, but only the six primers showed the highest sensitivity and specificity, which used in the 145 next steps (Table 1) . Primarily, our assay was meant to be quantitative and it showed an optimal 146 reproducibility when tested in analytical evaluation step using armored viral particle diluted in water 147 (R 2 value 0.99) and sputum sample (R 2 value 0.83). Analytical sensitivity yielded reliable LOD of 148 500 copies/ml less than 30 minutes regardless of matrix used for serial dilution (Figure 1 ). Of note, 149 our assay could detect 50 copies/ml, but some replicates showed unstable amplification. Therefore, 150\n\nwe considered the LOD of 500 copies/ml. Analytical specificity was 100% when used a wide range 151 of closely-and distantly-related viral species, prominent fungal and bacterial species, and human 152 DNA. Moreover, analytical evaluation included a wide range of inhibitors and 500 copies of the 153 simulated viral particles were successfully detected below 30 minutes (Figure 1) . In order to evaluate 154 the performance of our assay in clinic, we provided our assay and respective instructions to two 155 clinical centers (Figures 1, 2) . In total, 168 patients from center 1, among which 35 confirmed 156 COVID-19 cases, and 92 patients from center 2, among which 12 patients were confirmed COVID-157 19 cases, were recruited. One asymptomatic patient tested positive by qRT-PCR (Ct values 37) and 158 by our RT-LAMP was categorized suspected by in-charge physician and few days later became 159 positive. Four patients tested positive by qRT-PCR were negative by our RT-LAMP and one patient 160 tested negative by qRT-PCR was positive by our assay (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 1) . 161\n\nSubsequently, our RT-LAMP assay showed the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and 162 positive predictive value of 91.4%, 99.5%, 98.1%, and 97.7%, respectively (Supplementary Table 2  163 and 3). The fact that our assay could not detect four positive patients was owing to using 2.5 less 164 RNA input (2 \u00b5l) relative to qRT-PCR (5 \u00b5l). In the future, we will try to use various RNA input 165 volume (5, 8, and 10 \u00b5l) to observe if we could obtain a higher sensitivity. Although our RT-LAMP 166 assay was developed to be quantitative, we could not find any pattern and association between the 167 All rights reserved.

Therefore, we considered our assay a qualitative one. This fact will show that the 169 analytical valuation should be always accompanied by clinical validation to observe the real 170 capabilities of a given assay and that the results obtained in analytical evaluation step are not always 171 reflected in real-life. 172\n\nOur assay has several advantageous compared to qRT-PCR. First, our RT-LAMP assay is two times 173 faster relative to qRT-PCR ( Figure 2 ) and given the optimal diagnostic features could be used as a 174 reliable screening method in local and referral laboratory to keep up with the increasing demand of 175 suspected patients in critical situations. Secondly, our assay does not need the clod chain and could 176 be shipped at room temperature ( Figure 2) . 177\n\nIn conclusion, we present a rapid RT-LAMP assay that allows processing 2 to 2.5 more clinical 178 samples relative to CDC RT-PCR, which is indicative of its capacity to be deployed for high-179 throughput screening applications in local and referral laboratories. 180\n\nWe admit that our assay does not has the quantitative aspect of qRT-PCR and its sensitivity requires 181 improvement. These two limitations will be the subject of future investigation. Moreover, we will try 182 to use simple and fast nucleic acid extraction procedures (7) author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036376 doi: medRxiv preprint Figure 2 .
