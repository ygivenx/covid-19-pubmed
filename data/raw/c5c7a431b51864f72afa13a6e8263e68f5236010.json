{"title": "Spread of SARS--CoV--2 Coronavirus likely constrained by climate", "body": "Biogeography studies the patterns and processes underlying the distribution of Life on earth. One generalization emerging from more than two hundreds of years of natural history observations is that all organisms have a degree of environmental specialization. That is, while biomes in the planet have a range of different types of organisms(1), individual types of organisms cannot occur in every biome even when, distant apart as they might be, they converge into playing the same ecological roles within ecosystems (2) . Biogeographers and ecologists alike resort to the concept of ecological niche (3--5) to examine the relationship between the distributions of organisms and other biotic or abiotic factors controlling them. An organism is said to be within its ecological niche if death rates of the organism are lower that birth rates (6, 7) . That is, an organism cannot persist beyond its ecological niche, in a sink, unless there is a regular influx of individuals from source populations. Even if the organisms are regularly reaching a sink area, as one might expect with an easily dispersed pathogen, the spread and establishment of the organism will be limited by ecological constraints. Although biogeographic concepts, such as species ecological niches, are commonly used and applied to multicellular organisms (eukaryotes), there is an increased number of studies utilizing the ecological concepts and associated analytical tools to investigate relationships between the distributions of unicellular organisms (prokaryotic), or viruses, and a range of biotic and abiotic environmental factors (8--10) .\n\nBuilding on the concept of ecological niche, we develop projections of monthly changes in the climate suitability for SARS--CoV--2 outbreaks. Projections are obtained from an ensemble of 10 familiar machine learning ecological niche models (11) , each with 20 replications generated by repeating four times a 5--fold cross validation that accounts for and enables the quantification of variability across initial conditions (12) . Models were trained using the distribution of all recorded local transmissions of SARS--CoV--2 Coronavirus (excluding imported cases) with data compiled from John Hopkins University Mapping 2019--nCoV portal (13) . Predictors were monthly mean temperature, interaction term between monthly minimum temperature and maximum temperature, monthly precipitation sum, downward surface shortwave radiation, and actual evapotranspiration. Climate data refer to a period including January, February and March 2009-2018, with data downloaded from the updated high--resolution global climatology database --TerraClimate (14) . Models were then projected monthly for the rest of the year.\n\nLocal transmissions of SARS--CoV--2 Coronavirus were plotted against monthly values of climate predictors revealing aggregation within a relatively narrow range of climatic values (Figure 1 ). Comparing daily spread of the virus across geographical space versus climatic space reveals stronger aggregation in climate space than in geographical space. That is, while the virus is progressively colonizing most parts of the world, thus being geographically widespread, local infections were still prevalent within a relatively narrow set of environmental conditions ( Figure 2 ). The uneven colonization of geographic versus climatic space, invites the interpretation that climate is acting as a stronger constraint for the spread of the virus than geographical distances are. Most local transmissions occur in regions exposed to cool and dry conditions-measured both through evapotranspiration and precipitation-, and near the lower end of the radiation gradient (but rho with temperature = 0.78).\n\nThe mean and interquartile range of average environmental temperatures associated with positive cases is 5,81\u00baC (mean) and --3,44\u00baC to 12,55\u00baC (95% range) and for radiation values are 112,78 W/m\u00b2 (mean) and 61,07 W/m\u00b2 and 170,96 W/m\u00b2 (95% range). For precipitation, the values are 54,73 mm (mean) and 13,6 mm to 115,33 mm (95% range) while for evapotranspiration values are 28,80 mm (mean) and 5,97 mm and 48,44 mm (95% range). These values are estimated taking into account total numbers of positive cases (i.e., abundance), which are obviously strongly determined by contingent factors linked with the origin of the SARS--CoV--2 Coronavirus outbreak (the city of Wuhan in China) and subsequent pattern of spread. While the pattern of spread is likely to be partly constrained by climate, the actual numbers of positive cases are affected by non-climatic factors too (15) , some of which might be stochastic. Less sensitive measurements can be obtained by using the presence and absence of positive cases. With such an approach, the mean and estimated interquartile ranges for temperature are 9,14\u00baC (mean) and --11,43\u00baC to 27,15\u00baC (95% range), and for radiation they are 154,57 W/m\u00b2 (mean) and 54,31 W/m\u00b2 and 255,43 W/m\u00b2 (95 range). For precipitation they are 71,65 (mean) and 3,19 mm to 236,50 mm (95% range), while being 39,84 mm (mean) and 0,00 mm and 106,75 mm (95% range) for evapotranspiration.\n\nEcological niche models were used to estimate the combination of climate values best explaining infections with SARS--Cov--2. While the exact response curve to each one of the predictor variables changes slightly with the modeling technique and cross--validation repetition, they are generally consistent amongst themselves (supplementary Figure  S1 ) and with the raw distribution of positive cases across gradients ( Figure  1 ). Mean temperature and evapotranspiration (a surrogate of humidity) are the predictors best explaining the distribution of outbreaks of the virus, with areas either too cold or too hot, or too wet, having lower exposure to outbreaks. These two climatic variables are followed in importance by the interaction between minimum temperature and maximum temperature and radiation (supplementary Figure S2 ).\n\nProjections by models reveal the existence of likely seasonal changes in climate suitability for SARS--CoV--2 ( Figure  3 ). From April to September, much of higher latitude regions of the southern hemisphere are projected to face increases in climate suitability for outbreaks of SARS--CoV--2. That includes much of southern America, southern Africa and Southern Australia. Models also project that high latitude regions of the northern hemisphere might be badly hit by the virus as temperatures rise during the summer period. Areas exposed to increases in climate suitability for the virus include Canada and Russia, but also the Scandinavian countries. High elevation areas in the Andes and the Himalayas share the same prospects. Concurrently, areas that, as we speak, are of extreme concern in the northern hemisphere (chiefly Italy, Spain, France, Germany, UK, and USA) could witness a reduction in climate suitability for spread of SARS--CoV--2 between June and September. Beyond September and until the end of May, .

The analysis reveals that climate suitability for SARS--CoV--2 is greater across warm temperate climates from October to April. From April to September cold temperate regions are exposed highly suitable climate conditions for spread of the Coronavirus with a peak of suitability in polar climates between June and August. Arid environments have moderate suitability for the virus, with slight increases from March to April, while the tropics are also moderately suitable with increased climate suitability between June and August.\n\nMetrics of model performance on the test data were generally high (mean/SD AUC=0,76/0,03, see supplementary Figure S4 ). However, models with high performance in the test data can still generate projections that are uncertain when used for forecasting (17) . While improvements in the data and the models can reduce uncertainties, an issue we are now exploring at light of the recently published standards for applied ENMs (18) , characterizing the uncertainty of existing models is a first step towards understanding the limitations of projections and highlighting areas of concern. We generated 200 models by varying the initial conditions and model classes. As such, we were able to quantify and map some of the methodological uncertainties associated with projections ( Figure 5 ). Using this approach, we show that variation associated with changing initial conditions is negligible, which is unsurprising given that splits are randomly performed. In contrast, consistently with previous studies addressing climate change forecasts (19) , uncertainty associated with use of different modeling techniques is high (20, 21) . Models are considerably variable in areas projected to have low seasonal variability in climate suitability across much of Latin America, sub--Saharan Africa and South East Asia. Specific areas in India, China, Western and Central Europe, Coastal Australia, and Central USA also .

Such variability is probably a consequence of the sparse nature of the positive cases of COVID--19 in those areas, causing different models to adjust differently to the data. In contrast, inter--model variability across northern higher latitudes is lower and this is likely because most records between January and March are found there. Such areas of low inter--model variability coincide with areas where seasonal variation is also greater. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.12.20034728 doi: medRxiv preprint down by extreme conditions of both cold and heat as well as moist. Prevalence of respiratory disease outbreaks, such as influenza, during wintering conditions is common (23, 24) . But the similarity of climate determination of SARS--CoV--2 with its predecessor SARS--CoV--1 and even MERS--CoV is noteworthy, raising reasonable expectations that fundamental traits shared by at least these three Coronavirus might be conserved.\n\nFor example, an experiment examining the stability of MERS--CoV when laying on plastic and steel surfaces, under three environmental treatments (20\u00baC -40% relative humidity, 30\u00baC-- 30% RH, 30\u00baC - 80% RH), revealed that the virus was more stable in 20\u00baC and 40% RH treatment, decaying gradually in the second and third treatments (25) . Previous analyses of SARS--CoV--1 outbreaks in relation to meteorology also revealed significant correlations between the incidence of positive cases and aspects of the weather. For example, an initial investigation linking SARS outbreaks and temperature in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Beijing, and Taiyuan (26) , revealed significant correlations between SARS--CoV--1 incidences and temperature seven days (the known period of incubation of SARS--CoV--1) before the outbreak, with environmental temperatures associated with positive cases of SARS--CoV--1 ranging between 16\u00baC to 28\u00baC. They also found that incidence of the Coronavirus was inversely related to humidity. Another study conducted between 11 March and 22 May 2003 in Hong Kong (27) showed that SARS--CoV--1 incidences sharply decreased as temperature increased from 15\u00baC to 29\u00baC, after which it practically disappeared. In this study, incidences under the cooler end of the gradient were 18--fold higher than under the opposite warmer end of the gradient.\n\nThe mechanism underlying these patterns of climate determination is likely linked with the ability of the virus to survive external environmental conditions prior to reaching a host. For example, a recent study examined survival of dried SARS--CoV--1 Coronavirus on smooth surfaces and found that it would be viable for over 5 days at temperatures ranging between 11--25\u00baC and relative humidity of 40--50%, drastically loosing viability as temperatures and humidity increased (28) . Heat intolerance of the Corona viruses is probably related to it .

Humidity in the air is also expected to affect the transmissibility of respiratory viruses. Once the pathogens have been expelled from the respiratory tract by sneezing, they literally float in the air and they do so for a longer period when the humidity is reduced. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.12.20034728 doi: medRxiv preprint absence of proactive political response to COVID--19, could face epidemic outbreaks even under moderate climate suitability.\n\nAlthough climate is one of many factors likely affecting the spread of the virus, there is no doubt that the host behavior (35) and density (36) with geographical and climate factors (38, 39) . We expect that the SARS--CoV--2\n\nCoronavirus should continue to spread owing to seasonal changes of climate suitability and increased abundance of the viral pool. However, it is unlikely that outbreaks will happen everywhere with the same intensity. Not just because of seasonality in climate, but also because of the interactions with initial date of outbreak, which varies from country to country, and the varying responses to it.\n\nOur results will hopefully help anticipating the timing and magnitude of public interventions needed to mitigate the adverse consequences of the COVID--19 on public health. However, they do not substitute traditional epidemiological modeling and management of the disease that focus, essentially, on host behavior management as a strategy to minimize overall risk of spread.\n\n.

We used a 5--fold cross--validation(52), repeated 4 times, resulting in 20 replications per method. We then fitted ecological niche models for each replication using the four random cross--validation splits as training set and evaluated them against the fifth withheld data split. We used the area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot and the true skill statistic (TSS) to measure the predictive performance of models (53) . A ROC curve plots sensitivity values (true positive fraction) on the y-axis against '1 -specificity' values (false positive fraction) for all thresholds on the x--axis. AUC is a threshold--independent metric that varies from 0 to 1 and provides a single measure of model performance. AUC values under 0.5 indicate discrimination worse than expected by chance; a score of 0.5 implies random predictive discrimination; and a score of 1 indicates perfect discrimination. TSS is calculated as \"sensitivity + specificity --1\" and ranges from --1 to +1, where +1 indicates perfect agreement, a value of 0 implies agreement expected by chance, and a value of less than 0 indicates agreement lower than expected by chance. We then used the ensemble of 200 models to calculate and project a consensus distribution of climate suitability for the spread of SARS--CoV--2, for each month, across the globe. Consensus was achieved through AUC--weighted mean across all models (21) . The assessments of model performance on cross--validated samples are reported in Supplementary Figure S3 . Predictor variables importance Variable importance (54) and response curves (55) were estimated to infer the explanatory power and shape of the relationship for each one of the predictor variables used and the distribution of positive cases of SARS--CoV--2. Response curves are generated with the evaluation strip procedure (55) , implemented in sdm--R (11) . For each climate variable, the method generates the predicted probability of occurrence over all values in the gradient of the climate variable while the other climate variables are kept at their mean values. Then, visualizing the predicted values against the climate gradient represents the response of the species to the climate variable. Additional model--independent techniques were also implemented to evaluate the relative variable importance. We assessed the relative contribution of variables to explain the distributions of positive cases of SARS--CoV--2 in models using the variable importance (VI) analysis in sdm--R (11) . This method is a randomization procedure that measures the correlation between the predicted values of a model given the original predictors, and predictions of the same model but given the perturbed dataset in which the variable under investigation is randomly permutated. If the contribution of a variable to the model is high, then it is expected that the permutation would affect the prediction, and consequently, the correlation is low. Using this approach, '1 -correlation' is considered as a measure of variable importance (56) . We assessed the relative contribution of variables to explain the distributions of positive cases of SARS--CoV--2 in models using the variable importance (VI) analysis in. This is a permutation method that measures the relative importance .

This method quantifies the correlation between the predicted values and predictions where the variable under investigation is randomly permutated (11) . If the contribution of a variable to an SDM is high, then the permutation would affect the prediction values, and consequently, the correlation coefficient would be low. Therefore, '1 -correlation' can be considered as a measure of variable importance. Decomposition of sources of variation We used a 3--way ANOVA to decompose variation in model projections from the 10 different modeling techniques used and 20 replications of the initial conditions (data on SARS--CoV--2 cases). We compared variation arising from data and models with variation associated with projected seasonal changes in climate suitability. The latter is the desired projection, rather than a methodological uncertainty. However, comparison of seasonal projected variation in climate suitability with variation arising from different partitions of data and model classes provides a benchmark against which to compare model variability. If data and model variability was greater than projected seasonal variability, then reliance on the models could be questioned. The analysis involved running a three--way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) without replication(57, 58) for each cell, using climate suitability for SARS--CoV--2 as response variable and ecological niche models (ENM), bootstrapped samples (BS), and months (M) as factors. We then obtained the sum of squares to each of these sources and their interaction (ENM x BS, ENM x M, BS x M, ENM x BS x M). We estimated the variance components as the proportions of the sums of squares for the three sources of variation (and their interaction) with regards to the total sum of squares (20) . Analyses were performed for each cell in the world grid and we mapped each variance component separately (interaction term was not significant, hence not reported). Monthly variation in climate suitability is the expected outcome of the models. Variability associated with ENM and BS is expected to represent the variability associated with changing initial conditions (BS) and model classes (ENM). They are interpreted as uncertainty estimates and should ideally be much proportionally smaller than monthly variation.\n\n.
