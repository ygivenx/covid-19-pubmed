(Table   241 1 ). The results were analyzed for each cell line tested using a GI% scale as follows: samples 242 with low cytotoxic activity have GI < 50%; samples with moderate cytotoxic activity have GI 243 between 50% and 75%, and samples with high cytotoxic activity have GI > 75% (25). The 244 results showed that the extracts of P. cincinnata (3), P. gibertii (4), P. maliforms (5), P.\n\n245 mallacophyla (6), P. murchronata (7), P. morifolia (8) P. racemosa (10), P. setacea (11), P.\n\n.

Extracts from P. capsularis (2) and P. quadrangulares (9) 248 have high activity against HCT-116, low activity against SF-295, and cytotoxic activity from 249 low (P. quadrangulares) to moderate (P. capsularis) against OVACAR-8. The extract from 250 the leaves of P. alata (1) presented high cytotoxic activity in all human cancer cell lines 251 analyzed. Therefore, among the Passiflora leaf extracts evaluated P. alata (1) stands out with 252 promising cytotoxic activity, followed by P. capsularis (2) and P. quadrangulares (9). (Table 2) .\n\nThe cytotoxic activity of natural bioactive products against cancer cells is attributed to 295 the chemical composition of the product, and this practice of identification is the most 296 successful source of potential drug discovery and development (7).
