{"title": "Combating Intracellular Pathogens with Repurposed\nHost-Targeted Drugs", "body": "There is an\nurgent need for new strategies to combat hundreds of human disease-causing\nintracellular pathogens, including viruses, intracellular bacteria,\nand protozoa. Currently approved antiviral drugs treat fewer than\nten viral infections. While antibacterial agents are more widely available,\nonly a minority of them penetrate mammalian cells and achieve a therapeutic\nlevel in the appropriate intracellular compartment to treat intracellular\nbacterial infections.1 The narrow spectrum\nof coverage of most antimicrobials that target microbial functions,\nparticularly viruses, is another major limitation. Given the high\naverage cost (over two billion dollars) and long timeline (8\u201312\nyears) to develop a new drug, the scalability of targeting microbes\nindividually is limited. Lastly, resistance typically emerges rapidly\nwhen conventional drugs that target microbial functions are used as\nmonotherapy.\n\nAn attractive solution to overcome these limitations\nis to repurpose already approved drugs that target host functions\nrequired for the lifecycle of intracellular pathogens as antimicrobial\nagents (Figure 1). Off-label use of approved\ndrugs requires significantly less capital and time and diminishes\nthe clinical risks, because such drugs were already rigorously tested\n(toxicity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics dosing, etc.) for their\nprimary indication. Since some host functions are hijacked by various\nviruses, intracellular bacteria, and/or protozoa, they may represent\ntargets for broad-spectrum antimicrobials. This approach can therefore\nincrease the efficiency of antimicrobial development, improve drug\naccess for patients, and facilitate readiness for future outbreaks\nof emerging pathogens. Additionally, host-targeted approaches may\nhave the added benefit of a higher genetic barrier to the emergence\nof resistance.\n\nOne promising drug category\nfor repurposing as antimicrobials is inhibitors of host kinases, such\nas those widely approved for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory\nconditions.2 A large number of host kinases\nare co-opted by intracellular pathogens and thus represent attractive\ntargets for broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy.3 Indeed, recent efforts have demonstrated the therapeutic\npotential of kinase inhibitors to combat various intracellular microbial\ninfections. The anticancer epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)\nand/or ERBB2 kinase inhibitors gefitinib, erlotinib, and lapatinib\ndemonstrate in vitro activity against a number of\nviruses including hepatitis C virus (HCV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV),\nand poxvirus.4,5 Gefitinib and lapatinib also inhibit\nHCV and HCMV infections in a mouse and guinea pig model, respectively,4,5 and reduce replication of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in the lungs of infected mice.6 The antiviral effect of these drugs is mediated in part by inhibition\nof signaling in the entry stage and/or in F-actin-mediated intracellular\nviral trafficking.7,8 Enhanced antimicrobial immune\neffect via inhibition of EGFR/p38 mitogen associated protein kinase\nsignaling plays a role in their anti-Mtb activity.6\n\nAnother class of approved kinase inhibitors demonstrating\na broad antimicrobial coverage is the cellular Abelson tyrosine kinase\n(c-Abl) inhibitors, such as imatinib and nilotinib. These drugs inhibit\nreplication of Ebola virus (EBOV), dengue virus (DENV), Middle Eastern\nrespiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory\nsyndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in cultured cells and reduce vaccinia\nvirus load, spread, and overall mortality in a mouse model.9\u221212 Moreover, imatinib treatment impairs entry and intracellular survival\nof Mtb and Mycobacterium marinum in infected macrophages\nand reduces the bacterial load and associated pathologies in mice\ninfected with antibiotic-sensitive or resistant Mtb.13 Notably, when coadministered with rifamycins, imatinib\ndisplays synergy, indicating its potential utility in combination\nanti-Mtb drug regimens.13 The molecular\ntargets underlying the antimicrobial effect of c-Abl inhibitors remain\nto be validated. Moreover, while inhibition of actin motility is proposed\nas a mechanism of antiviral action of these drugs,12 the precise mechanism and mode of antibacterial action\nremain unknown.\n\nThe approved anticancer drugs sunitinib and\nerlotinib display potent activity against viruses from six viral families,\nincluding DENV and EBOV in cultured cells.14 Combinations of these drugs reduce morbidity and mortality of dengue\nand Ebola infected mice and are advancing into clinical studies for\ndengue and possibly Ebola in future outbreaks (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ NCT02380625).14 Inhibition of the cellular\nkinases adaptor protein 2 (AP2)-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1)\nand cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK), regulators of adaptor protein-mediated\nintracellular viral trafficking, is an important mechanism of action\n(MOA) of this antiviral approach.14\n\nThree approved immunosuppressive drugs that inhibit the phosphatidylinositol\n3\u2032-kinase\u2013Akt\u2013mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR)\npathway, leflunomide, everolimus, and sirolimus, reduce viremia and\nnephropathy progression in patients infected with BK virus, a member\nof the polyomavirus family, when used individually or in combination.15 Additionally, leflunomide demonstrates activity\nagainst HCMV both in vitro and in a rat model.16 While direct suppression of viral replication\nis proposed as one underlying mechanism of this approach, the precise\nMOA and molecular targets remain unknown.\n\nInhibitors of cyclophilin,\na host factor that facilitates protein folding, represent another\nclass of drugs, beyond kinase inhibitors, that shows promise as antimicrobials.\nCyclosporine, an immunosuppressant cyclophilin inhibitor, disrupts\nreplication of multiple viruses, including HCV, DENV, other flaviviruses,\nand human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro.17,18 Two experimental, nonimmunosuppressive cyclophilin inhibitors, alisporivir\nand SCY-635, also inhibit multiple RNA viruses in cultured cells,\nyet their effect in mouse models is variable.19 Alisporivir significantly reduced HCV viral load in chronically\ninfected patients;19 however, a clinical\nhold was placed on the Phase III trial due to toxicity. Cyclosporine\nalso inhibits the erythrocytic stages of Plasmodium falciparum\nin vitro and rodent malaria in a mouse model.20 Nevertheless, it remains unknown whether this\neffect results in part from inhibition of the host cyclophilin or\nsolely the parasitic protein.\n\nAnother candidate for repurposing\nis nitazoxanide, a drug approved for the treatment of parasite-induced\ndiarrhea. It inhibits replication of multiple viruses including HCV,\nflaviviruses, respiratory viruses, HIV, and hepatitis B virus (HBV)\nin cultured cells.21 Nitazoxanide blocks\nmaturation of the influenza hemagglutinin, but the target remains\nunknown. In the case of HCV, it is thought to activate protein kinase\nR leading to phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1,\nwhich then blocks viral replication.21 In\na phase II trial, nitazoxanide modestly reduced the time to resolution\nof symptoms of flu and is currently being evaluated in a phase III\ntrial for this indication.22 Whereas addition\nof nitazoxanide to peginterferon-ribavirin improved the sustained\nvirologic response in HCV patients in a phase II trial, no such improvement\nwas observed in a phase III trial in genotype 4 infected patients.23 Additionally, nitazoxanide is effective against\nclinical Mtb isolates, including those that are resistant to standard\nantituberculosis drugs.24 Disruption of\nmembrane potential and pH homeostasis in Mtb is one proposed MOA.24 A phase II clinical trial is currently ongoing\nto determine the efficacy of 14-day nitazoxanide treatment prior to\ninitiation of standard antituberculosis therapy.\n\nMetformin,\na drug approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, inhibits the\nintracellular growth of Mtb (including drug resistant strains) and\nenhances the efficacy of approved anti-Mtb drugs in cell culture.25 In a murine model, metformin mildly reduces\nMtb load in target organs and improves lung pathology when used individually\nor in combination drug treatment.25 Notably,\nmetformin demonstrated efficacy in decreasing disease severity and\nimproving clinical outcome as an adjunct therapy in retrospective\ncohorts of tuberculosis patients with diabetes and also reduced the\nincidence of latent tuberculosis in diabetic patients.25 Activation of the adenosine monophosphate\u2013activated\nprotein kinase (AMPK), which regulates cellular immune functions,\nis involved in mediating the antibacterial effect.25 Beyond tuberculosis, a clinical study that aims to evaluate\nthe size of HIV reservoirs upon addition of metformin to antiretroviral\nregimens is currently ongoing.\n\nStatins, drugs that inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl\ncoenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoAR), represent another potential class\nfor repurposing as host-targeted antimicrobials. Various statins inhibit\nreplication of HCV and DENV in vitro.26,27 Nevertheless, while several retrospective studies demonstrated that\nstatins reduce relapse rates in patients infected with HCV when added\nto peginterferon-ribavirin, this effect was quite variable.27 The mechanism of anti-HCV action of statins\nis mediated in part by their effect on lipid biosynthesis, as their\nantiviral activity in cells is reversed upon addition of mevalonate\nor geranylgeraniol, and resistance to these drugs coincides with an\nincrease in HMG-CoAR level.27 Due to their\nability to restore endothelial stability, statins were also proposed\nas a strategy to treat infections associated with endothelial dysfunction.\nWhile no formal study has been conducted, it was reported that atorvastatin\nin combination with an angiotensin receptor blocker reduced mortality\nin 100 Ebola patients in Sierra Leone.28\n\nThe antimalarial and anti-inflammatory drug chloroquine also\nshows some promise as an antimicrobial agent. In a nonhuman primate\ndengue model, chloroquine reduces viremia, cytokine production, and\norgan damage.29 However, when studied in\ndengue patients, it reduced pain and improved daily activity performance,\nyet it did not reduce disease duration or viremia.30,31 In mice infected with Zika virus, chloroquine increases the life\nspan and reduces vertical transmission and fetal brain infection.32 Moreover, it reduces acute lung injury, morbidity,\nand mortality in a mouse model of avian influenza A H5N1.33 The mechanism of antiviral activity of chloroquine\nis multifaceted and thought to involve alterations in the intracellular\npH causing impaired fusion and cleavage of the prM protein during\nflaviviral release and/or inhibition of autophagy.32,33 Chloroquine may also show utility as an add-on to antituberculosis\nregimens, as it enhances the intracellular killing of Mtb in human\nmacrophages by inhibiting the BCRP-1 (breast cancer resistance protein-1)-mediated\nactive efflux of the antituberculosis drugs isoniazid and pyrazinamide.34\n\nCollectively, these data provide a proof-of-concept\nfor the useful expansion of antimicrobial drug targets by focusing\non host functions and for the therapeutic potential of repurposed\ndrugs targeting these functions to combat intracellular pathogens.\nFurther benefit is provided by the higher genetic barrier to resistance\nassociated with many of these host-targeted approaches. Whereas emergence\nof resistance can complicate treatment with host-targeted approaches,\nas in the case of the chemokine receptor 5 antagonist maraviroc,35 the time to resistance with other host-targeted\napproaches is longer and the level of resistance is lower relative\nto typical direct-acting antimicrobials monotherapy. This is exemplified\nby treatment of DENV with sunitinib/erlotinib combinations, Mtb with\nnitazoxanide, and HCV with cyclophilin inhibitors.14,19,24 Targeting host proteins that are not under\nthe genetic control of microbes and simultaneously inhibiting several\nhost targets with the same drug or drug combination are thought to\nfacilitate this increase in the resistance barrier of these approaches.\n\nNevertheless, repurposing of host-targeted drugs as antimicrobials\nfaces its own challenges. Cellular proteins function in a complex\nnetwork of interactions, and their inhibitors are often nonselective.\nThus, the mechanism of antimicrobial action of host-targeted approaches\noften remains elusive, and the molecular targets underlying this effect\nare unvalidated. For example, erlotinib\u2019s effect on HCV infection\nwas first attributed solely to its effect on EGFR, its cancer target,\nyet it was later demonstrated that inhibition of GAK, another target\nthat is inhibited by erlotinib with a comparable potency to EGFR,\nalso plays a role.8,14 For other drugs, such as nitazoxanide\nand chloroquine, the MOA is even less clear and appears to be pathogen\nspecific.21,24,32\u221234\n\nAnother challenge is that the antimicrobial effect observed in vitro often cannot be reproduced in vivo. For example, several multi kinase inhibitors, such as lestaurtinib,\ndisplay in vitro activity against Plasmodium\nfalciparum but no significant effect in malaria-infected\nmice.36 Moreover, as exemplified by chloroquine\nfor dengue treatment, a promising effect in animal models cannot guarantee\nan effect in patients.29\u221231 Toxicity is another major concern. The Src- and c-Abl-inhibitor\ndasatinib demonstrates broad-spectrum antiviral activity in cultured\ncells, yet in a murine model of vaccinia virus, it induces immunosuppression\nrather than protection.12,37 It is thus important\nto investigate the antimicrobial activity and safety of these drugs\nin animal models of other infections. Nevertheless, for some drugs,\nit may be feasible to find a therapeutic window where the drug level\nis sufficient to inhibit microbial replication with minimal cellular\ntoxicity. Shifting from indications requiring long-term therapy (e.g.,\nmonths to years for cancer) to a shorter duration sufficient to treat\nmost acute infections should help limit toxicity. In contrast, the\nutility of some of these approaches for treating chronic infections\nrequiring longer duration treatment may be more limited. This is exemplified\nby the unexpected occurrence of pancreatitis during the Phase III\ntrial with alisporivir in chronically infected HCV patients. Nevertheless,\ndrugs that are extensively used in humans, such as metformin and chloroquine,\nare more likely to be safe add-ons to standard regimens even for chronic\ninfections.\n\nIn summary, these examples provide a proof-of-concept\nfor the potential feasibility of repurposing approved drugs as host-targeted\nbroad-spectrum therapies to combat intracellular microbial pathogens.\nTo effectively meet the clinical needs posed by emerging intracellular\npathogens, such approaches may find utility in combination with novel\nhost-targeted approaches and microbial-targeted strategies."}
