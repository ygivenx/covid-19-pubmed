{"title": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease AdvaxCpG- adjuvanted MultiTEP-based dual and single vaccines induce high-titer antibodies against various forms of tau and A\u03b2 pathological molecules", "body": "Data from previous clinical trials showed that high anti-A\u03b2 antibody titers correlated with a reduction in brain pathology in AN-1792 immunized AD patients that later came to autopsy, suggesting that therapeutic benefit was closely linked to antibody titers9. The cGMP grade delta inulin-based adjuvants, Advax\u2122 and AdvaxCpG were previously reported to enhance the immunogenicity and efficacy of various vaccines targeting viral and bacterial antigens in pre-clinical studies1819202122 and clinical trials2324. To select an adjuvant that will induce the highest antibody response and lowest variability of antibody levels in response to vaccinations of mice with AV-1959R, we tested these adjuvants in parallel with Quil-A25, a less purified version of QS21, the adjuvant that was used in the AN-1792 clinical trials9 as well as the commercial adjuvants Alhydrogel\u00ae, Montanide-ISA51, Montanide-ISA720, and MPLA-SM.\n\nThe results showed that AV-1959R formulated with AdvaxCpG induced significantly stronger antibody responses than all the other adjuvants with a low variability in responses between animals in the AdvaxCpG group (Fig. 1a). Analysis of antibody isotypes specific for A\u03b2 showed that Alhydrogel\u00ae, AdvaxTM, Montanide-ISA51 and -ISA720 adjuvants induced primarily an IgG1 (Th2) response, whereas AdvaxCpG, MPLA and Quil-A shifted the response toward IgG2ab, a Th1 response associated isotype (Figs 1b and S1). To further explore adjuvant effects on Th1 and Th2 phenotype, we measured the numbers of splenocytes producing IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 cytokines by ELISpot (spot-forming cells, SFC) and found that the AdvaxCpG group produced significantly higher frequencies of IFN-\u03b3+ and IL-4+ Th cells than the other adjuvant groups (Fig. 2a,b). The TLR4 agonist, MPLA was the only other GMP-grade adjuvant that generated significant numbers of both IFN-\u03b3+ and IL-4+ Th cells, although these were approximately 5 and 1.5 times, respectively, lower than those induced with AdvaxCpG (Fig. 2a,b). Calculation of the ratio of IL-4/IFN-\u03b3 positive Th cells (Fig. 2c) supported the antibody isotypes data and confirmed that AdvaxCpG was the strongest combined Th1 and Th2 adjuvant followed by MPLA, while other adjuvants only generated primarily Th2 responses to immunizations with AV-1959R. The level of Th1 responses induced by the control adjuvant, Quil-A were comparable to MPLA, but significantly lower than in AdvaxCpG (Figs 1 and 2). Finally, AdvaxCpG was also well tolerated by all animals with no evidence of either local or systemic vaccine adverse reactions. On the basis of these data, AdvaxCpG was selected as the sole adjuvant for all subsequent studies with MultiTEP-based AD vaccines targeting A\u03b2, tau, or A\u03b2/tau simultaneously or sequentially.\n\nAll tested AD vaccines formulated with AdvaxCpG adjuvant generated equally strong T cell responses, measured by detection of IFN-\u03b3+, IL4+ SFC or splenocytes proliferation specific to foreign Th cell epitopes incorporated in the MultiTEP platform (Fig. 3). Of note, no potentially harmful autoreactive Th cells were detected after re-stimulation of immune splenocytes with A\u03b2 or tau self-epitopes, either by ELISpot or splenocytes proliferation assay (data not shown). Importantly, generation of strong cellular immune responses to Th epitopes incorporated in the MultiTEP vaccine platform supported the production of equally high concentrations of anti-A\u03b2 antibodies in mice vaccinated with AV1959R/AV-1980R combination, AV-1959R, or AV-1953R. As expected, immunization with AV-1980R did not generate anti-A\u03b2 antibodies (Fig. 4a). It should be mentioned that concentrations of anti-tau antibodies were significantly lower in mice immunized with AV-1953R compared to mice vaccinated with the AV-1959R/AV-1980R combination or AV-1980R alone (Fig. 4b). These antibody response patterns were mirrored by the frequency of antibody secreting B cells (ASC); numbers of anti-A\u03b2 ASC were similar in mice immunized with single or combined vaccine formulations, while the numbers of anti-tau ASC were significantly lower in mice vaccinated with the dual-epitope AV-1953R vaccine (Fig. 5).\n\nWe hypothesized that anti-tau B cell epitopes attached to MultiTEP may not be well presented on the surface of the dual-epitope AV-1953R vaccine compared with the single epitope constructs. To address this possibility we undertook in silico structural modeling of the MultiTEP platform-based AV-1980R, AV-1959R and AV-1953R vaccines to examine the surface accessibility of B cell antigenic determinants of A\u03b21-11 (EFRH)26 in AV-1959R and AV-1953R and Tau2-18 (PRQEF; paper in preparation) in AV1980R and AV-1953R (Fig. 6). The modeling data suggested that on AV-1980R, two of three tau epitopes are linear with the side chains of the critical amino acid residues accessible on the surface (Fig. 6a,d), while in AV-1959R, all three A\u03b2 epitopes are linear with the side chains of the critical amino acid residues accessible on the surface (Fig. 6b,e). On AV-1953R, two out of three A\u03b2 and two out of three tau epitopes are linear, however, only side chains of A\u03b2, but not critical tau amino acid residues are easily accessible (Fig. 6c,f). Hence, changes in the epitope structure in combination with alterations in the side chain accessibility of critical residues in the epitopes may have led to the reduced anti-tau immunogenicity of the AV-1953R dual-epitope construct.\n\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of antibodies generated in mice immunized with single vaccines, AV-1959R or AV-1980R, the mixture of two vaccines (AV-1959R/AV-1980R) or dual vaccine (AV-1953R), we analyzed the binding of immune sera to various pathological forms of A\u03b2 and Tau in brain tissues from four different AD cases by Western Blot (WB) (Fig. 7a,b) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) (Fig. 7c).\n\nThe AV-1959R-immune sera bound monomeric A\u03b2 in soluble as well as low and high molecular weight oligomers in both soluble and insoluble fractions of brain homogenates. As expected, AV-1980R-immune sera recognized monomeric tau as well as multiple larger and smaller species of tau in both soluble and insoluble fractions of brain homogenates. What is more important, antibodies generated by either the mixture of vaccines (AV-1959R/AV-1980R) or the dual vaccine (AV-1953R) recognized the same species of A\u03b2 and tau that were detected by antisera isolated from mice vaccinated with appropriate single vaccines (AV-1959R and AV-1980R). Similar results have been obtained by IHC analyses of the same brain tissues (Fig. 7c). AV-1959R-immune sera bound senile plaques only, AV-1980R-immunie sera bound NFTs and neuritic threads, yet sera from mice immunized with AV-1959R/AV-1980R mixture or AV-1953R bound both pathologies: plaques, neuritic threads and NFTs. Therefore, both mixture of MultiTEP-platform based vaccines and the dual vaccine could be an effective active immunotherapeutic strategy for targeting both misfolded proteins involved in AD pathology.\n\nAll the above vaccines are based on our universal MultiTEP vaccine platform that is based on a string of Th foreign epitopes which, as shown in monkeys, can stimulate immune responses in a broad population of subjects with high MHC class II gene polymorphisms10. Notably, the universal MultiTEP platform may allow using two vaccines targeting A\u03b2 and tau at early and late stages of the disease, respectively. At the initiation of anti-tau immunotherapy AD patient immunized previously with anti-A\u03b2 vaccine would have large numbers of MultiTEP-specific memory Th cells and hence will rapidly generate therapeutic concentrations of antibodies. To simulate this situation, we immunized mice with AV-1959R formulated in AdvaxCpG or injected with AdvaxCpG only (control) and both groups were boosted with vaccine targeting tau B cell epitope, AV-1980R. Boosting of AV-1959R vaccinated mice with AV-1980R, but not sham-injected mice, induced significantly higher cellular (Fig. 8a) and humoral (Fig. 8b) immune responses, thus proving the synergistic effect of sequential immunization with different MultiTEP vaccines.\n\nAD is the most common cause of dementia, and worldwide nearly 46 million people have Alzheimer\u2019s or related dementias and this number is estimated to increase to 131.5 million by 205027. Currently, the majority of neuroscientists agree that the optimal targets for AD immunotherapy are pathological forms of A\u03b2 and tau. The relationship between these molecules in progression of AD pathology is still controversial, with the majority of data supporting A\u03b2 aggregation being the primary event in AD pathogenesis, secondarily triggering production of pathological tau282930313233. Nonetheless, accumulation of pathological tau in the brains correlates with dementia in AD patients. Thus, by the time clinical symptoms appear, there is already substantial tau pathology in the brains3435. Therefore, we propose that anti-A\u03b2 immunotherapy should be initiated at the early stages of AD to minimize synaptic and neuronal loss, while anti-tau immunotherapy may be most effective when disease progression is more advanced33. Thus we have decided to generate vaccines that will target pathological molecules either sequentially (e.g. A\u03b2 vaccinations followed by tau vaccination) or simultaneously (mixture of A\u03b2 plus tau vaccines, or dual-epitope vaccine containing both A\u03b2 and tau B cell epitopes). Importantly, although clinical data from anti-tau immunotherapy are not currently available, results from anti-A\u03b2 active and passive vaccination trials suggest that only relatively high concentrations of antibodies are therapeutically potent93031323336. Therefore, to enhance immune response in elderly patients with immunosenescence37 we have developed recombinant protein-based A\u03b2 and tau, or dual-epitope vaccines by fusing relevant epitopes of these pathological proteins with our MultiTEP platform which is composed of 12 foreign Th cell epitopes, which are the promiscuous PADRE epitope, epitopes from Tetanus Toxin (P23, P32, P21, P30, P2, P7, P17 and P28), Hepatitis B (HBVnc & HBsAg), and influenza virus (MT)10. We hypothesized that this should provide a broad coverage of human MHC class II polymorphism utilizing the wide array of tetanus toxin, hepatitis B and influenza Th epitopes incorporated into the MultiTEP platform. We have previously shown that MultiTEP platform-based DNA vaccine targeting A\u03b21-11 was immunogenic in mice, rabbits, and in monkeys with highly polymorphic MHC class II genes10111213. Here we further suggested that the same MultiTEP platform used for two different recombinant protein-based vaccines targeting A\u03b2 and tau could be beneficial because Th cells activated by AV-1959R will generate strong Th memory cells and will facilitate rapid production of anti-tau antibodies in the future vaccination/s of the same organism with the anti-tau vaccine, AV-1980R. In this study we report for the first time on the immunogenicity of vaccines targeting A\u03b2, tau or both pathological molecules simultaneously or sequentially.\n\nIt is well known that to be immunogenic any recombinant protein should be formulated in a potent adjuvant. In the AN-1792 trials a substantial portion of vaccinated subjects were non-responders, even though the strong QS21 adjuvant was used3138. Thus, the first aim of this study was to identify an optimal adjuvant for use in future AD vaccine trials. Figures 1 and 2 clearly demonstrate that AdvaxCpG formulated with AV-1959R vaccine provided significantly higher Th cell and anti-A\u03b2 antibody responses than any other adjuvant approved for human use or tested in clinical trials. Moreover, AdvaxCpG enhanced both Th2 and Th1 immune responses as reflected by the highest induction of not only IgG1, but also IgG2ab antibody isotype. Antibodies of the IgG2ab isotype exhibit the highest level of Fc effector function, which may provide the utmost efficiency in AD immunotherapy39, and the acute pro-inflammatory responses (IFN-\u03b3+SFC) generated by AV-1959R formulated with AdvaxCpG could be beneficial for AD treatment as well, since TLR4 agonist MPLA reduced A\u03b2 load in the brain of mice and enhanced cognitive function40. Finally, MultiTEP-based vaccine design is anticipated to be safe, because Th epitopes in this platform are all foreign and are not expressed in the brain.\n\nWhile this is the first report of AdvaxCpG being used for enhancement of the immune response against a B cell self-epitope fused with MultiTEP, the potency of this adjuvant has been previously demonstrated for vaccines targeting viral and bacterial antigens18. Importantly, a pandemic influenza vaccine formulated with Advax\u2122 was effective in human subjects up to 90 years of age, enhancing anti-influenza plasmablast and antibody responses across the whole age spectrum24. The ability of this delta-inulin based adjuvant to help counter the normal age-related decline in plasmablast and antibody responses to influenza immunization is likely to be important for human AD vaccine development, as these will principally need to be administered to elderly subjects with immuno-senescence34.\n\nAs mentioned above, the difference in the timing of A\u03b2 and tau accumulation34 and their different roles in the onset and progression of AD, suggest that sequential vaccinations with A\u03b2 and tau vaccines, or even combined vaccine against both molecules might represent the most effective AD approach. In particular, the same vaccine platform could be used to both prevent the onset of AD41424344, and also slow down development of tauopathy-associated dementia3245464748495051. In order to utilize such an approach we have developed three MultiTEP platform-based vaccines targeting A\u03b2, tau or both molecules simultaneously. All MultiTEP-based vaccines formulated with AdvaxCpG induce strong cellular and humoral (concentrations of antibody and numbers of ASC) immune responses (Figs 4 and 5). Co-immunizations with AV-1959R and AV-1980R vaccines provided high antibody titers against A\u03b2 and tau epitopes, respectively and these humoral immune responses did not differ from results of immunization with single AV-1980R or AV-1959R vaccines. However, the AV-1953R dual vaccine demonstrated significantly decreased anti-tau humoral immune responses compared with mice immunized with AV-1980R or a mixture of AV-1980R and AV-1959R vaccines (Figs 4 and 5). These decreases in antibody titers and numbers of ASC were not associated with insufficient Th cell stimulation by AV-1953R vs AV-1980R/AV-1959R, since the Th cell responses did not differ significantly between these groups (Fig. 3). This suggested that the three copies of tau2-18 B cell epitope in the MultiTEP vaccine might not be adequately presented on the surface of the folded AV-1953R or AV-1980R protein. In the absence of crystal structures, we performed an in silico approach to create structural models of the MultiTEP-based proteins that were further optimized using molecular dynamic simulation. From the 3D in silico models of these vaccines it appears that tau2-18 epitopes may have a less optimal presentation on the surface of AV-1953R dual vaccine than on the AV-1980R single one (Fig. 6). These subtle differences in the structural configuration may have played a critical role in the observed differences in the antibody titers and ASC numbers. Another possible reason could be B cell immunodominance of the A\u03b2 epitope which may suppress the maturation of tau-specific B cells by competition for antigen-specific Th cells. However, this was not the case when immunization was performed with a mixture of the two vaccines containing the same Th epitopes (Fig. 5). In addition, we have performed experiments with increased doses of AV-1953R and did not see an increase of anti-tau antibody concentrations too (data not shown).\n\nRegardless of the exact cause for the varying immunogenicity seen with the different MultiTEP-based tau vaccines it is clear that AV-1980R vaccine was more immunogenic than dual-epitope vaccine, AV-1953R, and therefore, it could be used for AD therapy following preventive vaccinations with AV-1959R. Mice primed by AV-1959R responded significantly better to the booster vaccination with AV-1980R (Fig. 8a,b). Importantly, regardless of the vaccine used (single, mixture or dual), the generated antibodies are potentially functional and bind equally well to the pathological deposits of A\u03b2 and tau in the brain sections from four AD cases (Fig. 7). It is important to note, that antibodies were effectively binding oligomeric forms of A\u03b2 and tau, which are widely believed to be much more toxic than the fibrils and plaques52.\n\nThese data may open a new avenue for future vaccination regimens, as the preventive AV-1959R could be used in prodromal AD subjects and then, in case of subsequent disease progression, boosting could be performed with the AV-1980R vaccine. Hence, using AV-1959R as a preventive vaccine, and then adding AV-1980R after onset of AD may provide the broadest protection across the AD clinical disease spectra.\n\nIn summary, optimal AD vaccine formulation, adjuvant selection and targeting of the right epitopes at the appropriate stage of disease will be crucial to a successful immunotherapeutic approach. An AD vaccine based on target epitopes attached to universal, highly immunogenic MultiTEP vaccine platform when combined with AdvaxCpG, a potent yet well tolerated adjuvant suitable for human use, induced extremely high antibody titers against both A\u03b2 and tau, at levels not previously achieved in other studies. The MultiTEP strategy provides a unique opportunity to generate high antibody responses in subjects by utilizing memory Th cells previously generated in the human population in response to infection or vaccination by tetanus toxin, hepatitis B and influenza. The MultiTEP platform may be especially beneficial in the elderly because the vaccine utilizes memory T cells that are in abundance in elderly patients instead of relying on activation of na\u00efve T cells, which decline with age. Therefore, the universal and highly immunogenic MultiTEP vaccine platform shows promise for both preventive and therapeutic approaches in AD.\n\nFemale, 6\u20138 weeks old C57BL/6 mice (H-2b haplotype) were obtained from Jackson Laboratory. All animals were housed in a temperature and light-cycle controlled facility, and their care was under the guidelines of the NIH and an approved IACUC protocol at UC Irvine. Animal experiments were performed according to the guideline of the Animal Care and Use Committee of UCI and approved by University Laboratory Animal Resources (ULAR).\n\nTo prepare three recombinant proteins, minigenes encoding 3A\u03b21-11-MultiTEP, 3Tau2-18-MultiTEP or 3A\u03b21-11-MultiTEP-3Tau2-18 were cloned into the modified E. coli expression vector pET11 (for AV-1959R; Novagen, MA) or pET24a (for AV-1980R and AV-1953R; Novagen, MA) in frame with 6xHis-Tag at the C-terminus. DNA sequencing was performed to confirm that the generated plasmids contained the correct sequences.\n\nRecombinant proteins were purified from E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with pET11/3A\u03b21-11-MultiTEP, pET24a/3Tau2-18-MultiTEP or pET24a/3A\u03b21-11-MultiTEP-3Tau2-18 plasmids as described1353. The final recombinant protein was analyzed in 10% Bis-Tris gel electrophoresis (NuPAGE Novex Gel, Invitrogen, CA). Protein bands were visualized by Coomassie dye (Fig. S2a) and specificity of the bands was confirmed by Western Blot (WB) using 6E10 (Fig. S2b) and anti-tau2-18 1C9 (Fig. S2c) monoclonal antibodies. The level of endotoxin was measured using E-TOXATE kits, as recommended by the manufacturer (Sigma, St Louis, MO).\n\nSeven groups of C57BL/6 mice (n = 5\u20138) were immunized with 20 \u03bcg of AV-1959R (pET11/3A\u03b21-11-MultiTEP) formulated with a selection of adjuvants: Montanide-ISA51 (s.c.; 50/50 ratio; SEPPIC, France), Montanide-ISA720 (s.c.; 50/50 ratio; SEPPIC, France), MPLA-SM (s.c.; 10 \u03bcg; Enzo, NY), Alhydrogel\u00ae (s.c.; 70 \u03bcg; BRENNTAG, Denmark), Quil-A (s.c.; 20 \u03bcg; BRENNTAG, Denmark), Advax\u2122, and AdvaxCpG (both i.m.; 1mg; Vaxine Pty Ltd, Adelaide, Australia). All mice were injected four times at biweekly intervals. Sera were collected 14 days after the third immunization and were used to measure anti-A\u03b2 antibody responses. On day 7 after the last injection mice were terminated and cellular immune responses were analyzed in splenocytes.\n\nFour groups of C57BL/6 mice (n = 8 per group) were immunized with AV-1959R (20 \u03bcg/per mouse/per injection), AV-1980R (pET24a/3Tau2-18-MultiTEP, 20 \u03bcg/per mouse/per injection), AV-1953R (pET24a/3A\u03b21-11-MultiTEP-3Tau2-18, 20 \u03bcg/per mouse/per injection) and mixture of AV-1959R and AV-1980R proteins (20 \u03bcg protein/mouse/injection), all formulated with AdvaxCpG adjuvant (1 mg/mouse/injection). Control groups of mice were injected with AdvaxCpG adjuvant only or PBS (n = 6 for both groups). All mice were injected four times at biweekly intervals. Sera were collected 14 days after third immunizations and anti-A\u03b2 and anti-tau antibody responses were analyzed. On day 7 after the last injection mice were terminated and cellular immune responses were analyzed in splenocytes.\n\nWe studied the effect of switching from AV-1959R to AV-1980R. Two groups of mice (n = 14) were immunized twice with AV-1959R formulated with AdvaxCpG or injected with AdvaxCpG only. Then both groups received a single vaccination with AV-1980R formulated with AdvaxCpG. Four mice from each group were terminated at day 7 after the third injection and T cell responses were measured in splenocytes. The remaining mice (n = 10 per group) were bled at day 14 after immunization for measurement of serum antibody responses.\n\nThe concentrations of anti-A\u03b2 and anti-tau antibodies in serum were determined by ELISA, as described previously115354. Anti-A\u03b2 and anti-tau antibody concentrations were calculated using a calibration curve generated with 6E10 (Covance, CA) and 1C9 mAbs (generated at the Institute for Molecular Medicine, Huntington Beach, CA), respectively. HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, ME) was used as secondary antibody. HRP-conjugated anti-IgG1, IgG2ab, IgG2b and IgM specific antibodies (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.) were used to characterize the isotype profiles of anti-A\u03b2 antibodies in individual sera at different dilutions (see legend of Fig. S1).\n\nAnalysis of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 producing T cells was performed in splenocyte cultures from immunized mice by ELISpot assay (BD Biosciences, CA), as previously described10445556. Cultures of splenocytes were re-stimulated in vitro with a cocktail of 12 peptides representing the Th epitopes in the MultiTEP vaccine10 (2 \u03bcg/ml of each peptide), soluble A\u03b240, tau2-18 or irrelevant peptides at 10 \u03bcg/ml for 20 hours. The numbers of SFC per 106 splenocytes stimulated with Th peptides or A\u03b240 or tau2-18, were then counted.\n\nT cell proliferation assay was performed in splenocyte cultures using a [3H]-thymidine incorporation assay, as previously described5357. The cultures of splenocytes from mice were re-stimulated in vitro with the same antigens that were used in ELISpot assay. Stimulation index (SI) was calculated for each mouse using the formula: SI = experimental count/spontaneous count, where spontaneous count wells included irrelevant peptide.\n\nAntibody-secreting B cells (ASC) specific to A\u03b2 and tau were detected in splenocytes by ELISpot (Mabtech Inc, Cincinnati, OH). Splenocytes from experimental and control mice were incubated for 24 hours in 96-well plates coated with A\u03b242 or tau2-18 peptides. After incubation the assay was performed as recommended by the manufacturer (Mabtech Inc, Cincinnati, OH).\n\n0.2 g of brain tissue from four different AD cases were homogenized in 0.4 ml TBS buffer with Halt\u2122 Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (100X, Thermo Scientific, CA), then centrifuged at 6400xg for 15 minutes at +4 \u00b0C. Supernatants were collected and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for further analysis as soluble fractions. Remaining pellets were solubilized in 70% formic acid (FA) and centrifuged at 100,000 \u00d7 g for 1 hr at +4 \u00b0C. Avoiding upper lipid layer, the lower aqueous layer was collected and stored at \u221270 \u00b0C for later quantification of insoluble A\u03b2 and tau levels. Prior to the next step FA fractions were neutralized with 5N sodium hydroxide (NaOH) following a neutralization buffer (1 M TRIS Base, 0.5 M NaH2PO4) and precipitated with ice cold 10% Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) in acetone. Then precipitated fractions were resolubilized in equal volume of TBS. Protein concentration was determined using BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, IL) and samples were adjusted to the equal concentration.\n\nWB with soluble and insoluble fractions of four brain homogenates were performed as described in10445556. Briefly, soluble and insoluble fractions applied to electrophoresis on NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris gel in MES buffer under reducing conditions (Invitrogen, CA) and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare, NJ). For antigen retrieval, membranes with soluble fractions were boiled in PBS at 100 \u00b0C as described in Rosen et al.58 and then were blocked with 5% fat-free dry milk. Membranes with insoluble fractions were blocked without antigen retrieval. A\u03b2 and tau were visualized by incubating with sera from mice immunized with AV-1959R, AV-1980R, AV-1953R or mixture of AV-1959R and AV-1980R followed by HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA). Sera were used after normalization of antibody concentration measured by ELISA (1 \u03bcg/ml for anti-A\u03b2 and 0.4 \u03bcg/ml for anti-tau).\n\nSera from mice immunized with AV-1959R, AV-1980R, AV-1953R and mixture of AV-1959R and AV-1980R were screened for the ability to bind to human A\u03b2 plaques or/and tau tangles using 40 \u03bcm brain sections of formalin-fixed cortical tissues from four different severe AD cases (received from Brain Bank and Tissue Repository, MIND, UC Irvine) using immunohistochemistry as described previously10445556. A digital camera (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) was used to capture images of the plaques at 60\u00d7 magnification.\n\nSequences corresponding to each individual epitope within each MultiTEP protein (AV-1980R, AV-1959R AV-1953R) were submitted to the PSIPRED protein structure prediction server59 for folding profile based threading. Those template structures matching the folding pattern of the query with <=0.0001 p-value were selected (The individual templates used and the appropriate references are provided in Supplementary Tables S1\u2013S3). Based on the multiple sequence alignment between the query and the templates, homology models were generated using the homology modeling program Modeller v9.13 60. Then each homology model was evaluated, refined and selected based on the discrete optimized protein energy score (DOPES). Then models were relaxed using the molecular dynamics simulation program NAMD v2.9 61 for 1000 steps at 310 K temperature. Finally, models of the synthetic MultiTEP proteins containing A\u03b21-11 or tau2-8 epitopes and the combination were visualized using the molecular modeling program UCSF chimera62.\n\nStatistical parameters (mean, standard deviation (SD), significant difference, etc.) were calculated using the Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). Statistically significant differences were examined using a t-test or analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey\u2019s multiple comparisons post-test (a P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant).\n\nHow to cite this article: Davtyan, H. et al.
