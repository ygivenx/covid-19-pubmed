{"title": "", "body": "Pinnipedia\n\nPinnipedia is a suborder of carnivorous mammals found exclusively in aquatic habitats. The suborder includes three recognized extant families: Odobenidae (walrus), Otoriidae (sea lions and fur seals), and Phocidae (true seals). Members of this suborder are easily recognized by their general body shape and the morphology of the appendages that are adapted to the aquatic environment. Both thoracic and pelvic appendages are modified for effective locomotion in water and take the form of flippers. In otoriids, the thoracic appendages are the dominant ones and also allow the animals to support the weight of the trunk on land and effectively \"walk,\" whereas the phocids do not; and odobenids, although able to support their trunks with the forelimbs, are less agile. Members of this suborder are found around the entire globe, including the Arctic and Antarctic regions. One genus, Pusa (which includes the Ladoga ringed seal, the Saimaa ringed seal, and the Baikal seal) has established a niche in fresh water habitats, whereas the remainder is marine. The smallest pinniped, Pusa sibirica (the Baikal seal), which weighs about 45 kilograms (kg) when full grown, grows to about 1 meter (m) long; the largest, Mirounga leonina (the male Southern elephant seal), grows to about 5 m long and weighs up to 3200 kg. 4 Many pinnipeds are typically found foraging and resting in and near the relatively shallow waters of the littoral zone; others spend most of their lives as pelagic animals, and still others are pagophilic (ice loving).\n\nMany members of this suborder have been exploited by humans for centuries. Several are now extinct, and many more have been hunted to near extinction. Notably, the Northern elephant seal population was estimated at only around 20 individuals at the end of the 1890s. 5 This severe population reduction is thought to have contributed to significant loss of genetic diversity and is clinically important.\n\nRates of congenital defects in Northern elephant seals are highest compared with any other of the pinniped species presented to rehabilitation facilities in North America ( Figure 44 -1), presumably as a result of defect heritability and lack of genetic diversity. 68 A study of tissues collected from 371 stranded California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) found that sick animals have higher-than-normal parental relatedness, suggesting that these animals too have been impacted by human exploitation. 1 Recently, low major histocompatibility complex (MHC) allelic diversity was shown to be a strong predictor of pup survival in the gray seal (Halichoerus grypus) on the Isle of May, in the United Kingdom. 15 The most endangered of the current extant species are the Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus monachus), the Hawaiian monk seal (Monachus schauinslandi), and the Caspian seal (Pusa caspica). Data are deficient, and for a number of other species, no status determination may be made at this time. 38 At the time of writing this chapter, approximately 1100 individual Hawaiian monk seals were estimated to make up the entire population, which is declining at a rate of approximately 4% per year. 53 In contrast, many other pinniped populations are thriving and increasing in numbers and resulting in conflict with human interests or activities. This, at times, results in harassment, injury, or death of animals. Negative human interactions (fishing gear or trash entanglement, gunshots, boat strike, etc.) account for as much as 8% to 10% of the cases admitted to rehabilitation centers in North America annually.\n\nIn their natural habitats, pinnipeds share with humans many risk factors for diseases, and many are thus excellent sentinel species used in efforts toward better understanding of several diseases, including domoic acid intoxication, leptospirosis, urogenital carcinoma, and malnutrition. 3, 28, 56 Pinnipeds possess exquisite anatomic, to body length tends to be higher than in most terrestrial herbivores. This anatomic feature is most likely related to the relative high body mass, high energy requirements, diet content, and motility rate of the digesta. 33 Pinniped dentition is polyphydont and heterodont, although deciduous teeth are resorbed prior to or at birth, and the permanent dentition erupts shortly after birth.\n\nPhocids lack external pinnae and are unable to rotate their pelvic appendages (hind flippers) underneath their trunk and therefore are unable to \"walk\" on land. The pelvic appendages are the primary means of generating locomotory force in the water. The animal splays the digits and oscillates the paired hind flippers laterally to create forward thrust. Unilateral hind flipper amputees do well, but bilateral hind flipper amputees may have a significant disability and reduced chance of thriving in the wild.\n\nNails are prominent on all flippers. Nails may be traumatized, may be prone to nail-bed infections, and may be the source of injury to in-contact animals' eyes. Co-housed seals will frequently \"swat\" at each other with fore flippers, and this may easily cause corneal injuries. Reducing animal density in enclosures will generally prevent this.\n\nAlthough phocids do not have pinnae, those that have been examined have a unique anatomy to the external auditory canal. The canal is surrounded by a rich vascular plexus. Presumably, this arrangement aids in protecting the ear canal and the tympanum from pressures at depth during dives. 62, 73 At TMMC, a considerable decrease has been observed in cases of otitis externa in seals housed with access to deeper pools compared with those housed with access to only shallow pools. Providing access to deeper pools and encouraging dive behavior by placing novel objects on the pool floor appear to have been contributing factors in the reduction of cases. The hypothesis is that animals that dive more activate dynamic changes in the plexus more frequently, thus causing a \"flushing\" action and promoting ear canal health.\n\nThermal insulation in phocids is provided by adaptations of the skin (epidermis, dermis, hypodermis) and subcutaneous adipose stores rather than by the pelage. Species variation exists between the amount of lipids incorporated into the skin itself rather than deposited subcutaneously. As a result, skin thickness, compared with the subcutaneous fat thickness of seals, varies, and this may be clinically significant when surgical incision of the skin is indicated.\n\nPhocids possess remarkable vascular adaptations to diving. The spinal cord is surrounded by a prominent extradural vascular sinus. Using Doppler transducers, flow within this structure has been shown to be quite variable, rostral at times and caudal at others. 55 Clinically, it appears that blood sometimes pools at this site with little circulatory refresh. This is important to keep in mind, as this site is also the most easily accessible for peripheral blood collection in phocid seals. On occasion, clinical chemistry and blood gas results may be impacted by the flow dynamics at this site. The author and his colleagues have infused euthanasia solution at this site with no effect until it was followed by a large bolus of fluids. Phocids also have prominent abdominal venous plexuses that drain to a large \"hepatic sinus\" and then to the thoracic vena cava. At the diaphragm, a muscular sphincter appears to \"meter out\" blood as cardiac preload during dives. This is augmented by sympathetically mediated splenic contraction during dives. Venous partial pressure of oxygen may actually exceed arterial partial pressure of oxygen at times as a result of the unique ability of these animals to \"shunt\" blood to metabolically active tissues. 67 Phocid males do not have a scrotum of any significance; the testes are contained within the inguinal region and may be difficult to locate by palpation.\n\nSea lions and fur seals are quite similar to each other in overall body shape. They possess pinnae, and the dominant appendages are the physiologic, and behavioral adaptations to the aquatic environment. These adaptations such as gas management during diving, thermoregulation, and environmental vigilance are fascinating from a comparative perspective. In addition, pinnipeds are generally easy to train for operant conditioning, and many are capable of complex behavioral modification, including learned behaviors conducive to human endeavors such as performance or utility work. As a result, pinnipeds frequently present to clinical veterinarians and require health assessments, medical care, or support during investigations.\n\nGeneral descriptions of the unique aspects of anatomy, physiology, and behavior important to clinical care and management of the most commonly clinically encountered pinnipeds, as well as typical patient presentations, comprise the remainder of this chapter. Much of the information included here is derived from the experiences of the author and colleagues at The Marine Mammal Center (TMMC) in Sausalito, California, and elsewhere, and a fair amount of personal clinical opinion is also included. TMMC typically treats around 600 to 800 marine mammals annually, the vast majority being California sea lions, elephant seals, and harbor seals. This chapter material should provide the general practitioner of zoologic medicine with enough information to make sound diagnostic and treatment plans for the most commonly encountered pinniped patients and health problems.\n\nAll pinnipeds are generally fusiform in body shape with variations in the morphology of the head and appendages. The appendages are adapted to aquatic mobility and thermoregulation, being flattened with little or no individualization between digits. The proximal bones of the pelvic appendage (femur, patella, tibia, and fibula) are incorporated within the trunk at the level of the pelvis, leaving only the tarsus, metatarsus, and phalanges to serve as the hind flipper. Similarly, the proximal caudal vertebrae of the tail are incorporated into the trunk at the pelvis, and only a relatively short, protruding tail is present. Vibrissae and eyes are the prominent features of the head. Male elephant seals and hooded seals have prominent saccular adaptations to the nasal passages, and male walruses have diverticulae of the oropharynx. In all probability, these adaptations are important in acoustic or visual signaling during male-associated reproductive behavior. Pinniped kidneys are discretely multireniculated, composed of multiple functional subunits, presumably an adaptation to life in a hypertonic environment. 58 All pinnipeds are also monogastric, with very long small intestines (averaging 25 times the body length for elephant seals). The ratio of small intestine length \n\nWalruses are distinct in their bulk and mass. The morphology and use of their appendages is different from those of phocids and otariids and may be thought of as being intermediate between the two. All flippers are apparently important for effective mobility on land and in water. They are able to support their forequarters with the thoracic flippers and can rotate the pelvic appendages underneath, although they are not nearly as agile on solid surfaces as their smaller \"cousins\" are.\n\nTheir hair coat is sparse, and they rely on massive investment of adipose within the modified skin and subcutaneous tissues for insulation. Maxillary canine teeth are the dominant teeth and are known as tusks. Tusks are the prominent features of walruses, apparently important in social and other behaviors, and often presented as clinical concerns. 72 Walruses appear to be more prone to gastrointestinal (GI) obstructions compared with other pinnipeds. The pyloric outflow tracts of otariids and phocids are remarkably small in diameter. This is probably useful to prevent indigestible objects such as stones, squid beaks, fish otoliths, and so on from passing into the intestines from the stomach. These objects are often incidentally seen within the lumen of the stomach during endoscopic examination or at necropsy. However, in walruses, intestinal foreign body entrapment requiring enterotomy has been reported. Walruses appear to have a propensity to ingest anything accessible in a controlled environment. 52, 72 \n\nAll pinnipeds require access to water and dry haul-out areas to rest. In the United States, the specifications for enclosure space provisions in permanent collections are mandated by law (the Animal Welfare Act) and include specific formulas based on average adult body length for the species and number of individuals housed within the enclosure. Standards for temporary housing of animals in rehabilitation settings have been developed by the National Oceanic and thoracic appendages, which flex laterally at the carpus to provide for locomotion on solid surfaces. Otariids do often \"drag\" their hind flippers when moving quickly; it would seem a more effective method for higher speeds on land. Amputation of pelvic appendages causes no significant disability, but amputation of a fore flipper is not recommended. Although arthrodesis of the carpal joint has been effective, an individual without a fore flipper would be significantly impaired on land and in water.\n\nCloser inspection reveals the difference between the pelages of sea lions and fur seals. Sea lions have a short, stout, slick hair coat that lies flat against the skin when wet. Fur seals have a highly specialized hair coat with prominent guard and secondary hairs that trap air and is an important means of thermoregulation. Fur seals thus need to \"groom\" and may be seen lolling at the water surface, rolling and rubbing, as sea otters do. Sea lions rely primarily on subcutaneous adipose tissue to provide insulation.\n\nWith practice, the dentition of California sea lions can be used to distinguish between \"pups\" (animals less than 1 year old) and \"yearlings\" (animals between 1 and 2 years of age). During the first year of life, the prominent maxillary tooth is the corner incisor, which has the appearance of a canine tooth and can easily be confused with it. During the second year of life, the canine tooth erupts beyond the corner incisor and becomes the dominant tooth in the arcade.\n\nThe carina of otariids is located near the level of the thoracic inlet, not over the base of the heart as in phocids (Figure 44 -2). This may lead to bronchial intubation during anesthesia if caution is not used. At the other end of the sea lion, the perineum and distal anus are made up of multiple folds of loose tissue, presumably to assist in preventing water intrusion during dives. This may make it difficult to collect samples or insert instruments into the rectum, and care must be taken to avoid causing trauma. Conscious individual animals often are more resistant to attempts to pass something per rectum than to blood sampling.\n\nNails are present on all flippers but are much reduced on the fore flippers. Otariids also possess a prominent hepatic sinus, but the abdominal plexuses are not nearly as significant as in phocids. \n\nempirical perspective, this makes sense. Pinniped eyes, as is the case with all marine mammal eyes, are particularly adapted for low-light visual acuity. These animals forage in the water column, some at great depths with low ambient light. When the animals are kept away from these depths and fed in air, as is often the case with collection animals, their eyes are exposed to more solar radiation than in their natural habitat. Husbandry conditions are a likely contributing factor, so preventive measures should be a priority. Provision of shade; darkened, nonreflective surfaces; feeding underwater; and stringent attention to water quality must be considered in a preventive medicine plan for pinnipeds. In one published study of 111 captive pinnipeds, 48.6% had lens disease, cataracts, or both. 11 Another study documented ocular pathology in 81.5% of 27 captive pinnipeds and only 35% of wild submitted ones. 49 The conclusion was that diseases of the eye are \"common\" in wild and captive pinnipeds, although a higher prevalence exists in captive populations. However, a retrospective search of the medical records of documented pathology from 10,919 California sea lions presented to TMMC revealed only 272 (2.5%) results with recorded ocular disease. This topic has received considerable attention in the literature (refer to the discussion by Gage in the seventh edition of this text).\n\nWater quality also has a powerful impact on overall pinniped health and welfare. These animals evolved over millions of years to spend most of their waking hours (and many of their sleeping hours) in the sea, a thick soup of microbial life that has evolved over billions of years; the so-called \"rare biosphere.\" This biomass is immense; 98% of the primary production of the oceans and the mediation of all biogeochemical processes in the oceans are accounted for by these microbes. 60 Pinnipeds are merely visitors to this microbial world, but they visit often. They bathe in it, bask in it, swallow it, cover their bodies with it, soak their mucous membranes in it, even inhale it. They have successfully established biologic mechanisms to live in harmony with it, most of the time. It is all about balance. When conditions tip the balance in favor of the microbes, disease may result. The clinical veterinarian will do well to keep in mind the triad of factors that influence the development of disease: the host, the agent, and the environment. Numerous reports of microbial surveillance in free-ranging animals and those that have presented as patients have been published. In a study of healthy pinnipeds off the California coast directed at detection of Salmonella spp., 21% of California sea lion pups and 87% of Northern elephant seal pups were culture positive for Salmonella spp. 63 What is really needed for effective management of pinniped health is better understanding of the influences on the aquatic system that favor the microbes, and pressures on even the natural system appear to be increasing. Perhaps this is the explanation for the observation that blooms of diatoms responsible for the production of domoic acid and the resulting intoxication in animals appear to be increasing in frequency and magnitude off the coastal North American Pacific. 41 More importantly for clinical veterinarians, artificial habitats may always be expected to place some selection pressures on the microbial ecology of the water within. Alterations of the abiotic water parameters are often performed with the presumed aim of creating a \"healthier\" environment for inhabitants. In the United States, the water quality of permanent marine mammal enclosures is mandated by the Animal Welfare Act of 1972, as amended and promulgated by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). With respect to the microbial content of water, the mandate states: \"The coliform bacteria count of the primary enclosure pool shall not exceed 1000 MPN (most probable number) per 100 milliliters (mL) of water.\" 9 This is, in fact, a fairly easy standard to meet through oxidation, as detailed in an instructional pamphlet published by the USDA titled \"The Sterilization of Marine Mammal Pool Waters.\" 61 However, this author argues that in all things, artificial and controlled environments should aim to mimic the natural environment, whenever possible, and that excessive oxidation may work against this goal. The author' s Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries, and these standards contain useful information regarding the special housing requirements for this taxon. 23 In the author' s opinion, it would be difficult to provide an animal too much dry haul-out space or too much water to swim in. Pinnipeds tend to be gregarious, often associating in groups, particularly when hauled out. The tendency for direct contact between hauled-out individuals seems to vary with species. California sea lions are often observed resting while in contact, even on top of one another. Harbor seals, in contrast, appear to desire a gap between each other and, as mentioned earlier, will often \"swat\" at each other if they get too close. Interestingly, weather conditions may impact the distance between individuals. During rain, resting sea lions have been observed to separate, leaving some space between each other. Sea lions, in particular, appear to enjoy climbing up on structures and will often be seen resting on pool walls, transport crates, shelves, and almost anything that allows them purchase to climb.\n\nAccess to water is critical. These animals behaviorally thermoregulate. They are adapted to maintain body temperature while spending much of their lives in the perennial \"heat sink\" of the ocean. Core body temperature of most is approximately 37\u00b0 C. Even in \"warmer\" water environments, the water temperature is lower than core body temperature, and the thermal conductivity of water is about 25 times that of air. Thus, the insulation and circulatory adaptations discussed above are designed to maintain core body temperature; when the animal is out of the water, the risk of hyperthermia is always present. A sea lion that has restricted access to water and is producing metabolic heat because of muscular activity such as pacing or struggling against restraint may quickly develop heat prostration. When in doubt, the animal should be cooled off with a dousing of water. It is very difficult to get a pinniped too cold or too wet. Emaciated young animals are an exception to this rule (animals under anesthesia are another). This special class of patients lacks the insulation, is often metabolically challenged, may have immature physiologic mechanisms for thermoregulation and is thus prone to hypothermia when ambient air temperatures are low, particularly if the animals are wet. Protection from the elements must be provided for this special class of patients. Thermal stress risks are the opposite for older animals in fair to good body condition. This author is aware, some concern is felt that a wet animal will heat up faster than a dry one. Recommendations have been made to avoid wetting the animals when they are lying in the sun. These recommendations have been based on published observation that a wet hair coat will be darker in coloration compared with a dry one and thus will absorb more solar radiation. 40 This report did not take into account evaporative cooling or measure core temperatures or any thermal flux from the animals themselves; rather, it was focused on enclosure design. The authors of that paper also made several assumptions based on measures from terrestrial animals. Pinnipeds are not terrestrial animals. Individual pinnipeds often appear to be less anxious and more comfortable when in water. Animals transported from one location to another unfamiliar location will often stay in the water almost exclusively (sometimes swimming for days) until they become comfortable in the new surroundings. Wetting an animal will also often stimulate defecation. If physiologically stable, young orphans should be exposed to water following feeding to encourage normal GI motility. Adult sea lions with reduced appetites may sometimes be enticed to eat by directing a steady stream of water from a hose to the face.\n\nOcular disease is one of the most common presenting complaints of pinniped patients in managed collections, leading to a large number of challenging medical treatments and complicated surgical procedures, sometimes with less-than-desirable outcomes. Protection from exposure to solar radiation is probably significant with regard to the ocular health of pinnipeds. Evidence that keratopathies and secondary intraocular disease are associated with solar radiation exposure is increasing. Captive pinnipeds that did not have access to shade were almost 10 times as likely to develop lens luxations, cataracts, or both compared with those provided shade. 21 From an classes of marine mammals. The caloric content of individual lots of fish fed is also easily calculated from a simple proximate analysis of a sample, and many facilities use caloric density of fish lots to determine ration formulation. Practically, feeding decisions may be simplified by monitoring body weights. Assuming that the handling has been proper and monitored, if a variety of items expected to be found in the animals' natural diet (a variety of fish types and perhaps an invertebrate or two) are fed, the diet may be expected to be balanced. If the fed diet meets energy requirements, the animals will grow or gain weight, depending on their stage of nutrition and health status. If not, the animals will lose weight or not grow. Therefore, an accurate means of monitoring body condition is essential. Regular body weights will suffice in most instances, although more detailed assessments, including ultrasonographic determination of \"blubber\" thickness or thermographic profiles over time may be useful in some animals. The clinician should also remember that a \"lag time\" often occurs with any ration change. An animal that has had an increase of caloric intake may not show any weight gain for a week or two and likewise an animal that has had a reduction in intake may not lose weight for a week or two.\n\nFasting in pinnipeds presents the clinical veterinarian with some unique concerns. Like other marine mammals, pinnipeds are well known to \"mask\" signs of pathology, appearing normal in spite of significant underlying disease. Appetite and attitude are often the first to change in an ill animal. In general, any collection animal that refuses food without an obvious explanation should be evaluated for a medical disorder. A reduction in appetite may be the only indication of serious illness. However, pinnipeds do fast at times during states of normal health. Elephant seal weanlings fast for 4 to 6 weeks following the departure of the dam prior to initiating foraging. They survive this entire period without any oral intake, neither food nor water, after which they \"switch modes\" to foraging and begin to seek and perhaps find solid foods to sustain themselves. Animals of this age group are frequently presented for rehabilitation and present a challenge in determining whether they should be fed or not. To date, no practical and specific biomarker of physiologic status that indicates the fasting or foraging stage has been recognized. Plasma hormone levels and fatty acid profiles have been investigated, and ratios of serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to creatine (Cr) have showed some promise but have not held up in clinical experience. Intact adult pinniped males will often go \"off feed\" during times of rut behavior and may not eat for weeks at a time. The clinician faced with a pinniped that refuses food must carefully weigh all the evidence at hand and, when in doubt, pursue an investigation that includes at a minimum a complete blood cell (CBC) count and a serum chemistry profile. Although pinnipeds appear to be exceptionally adept at metabolic water production via oxidative phosphorylation of fats, fresh water should be made available at all times.\n\nNeonates present another challenge to the clinical veterinarian. Preweaned orphans require milk protein replacement and are usually gradually transitioned to a fish-based diet. Numerous references, recipes, and sources of practical information are available for the reader to consider when adopting a strategy for the situation at hand.\n\nHere only a few important considerations (in the author' s opinion) to be made when formulating a plan will be discussed. It must be kept in mind that these animals are predominantly piscivorous. Protein sources other than fish are not optimal, although some have a strong record of being used with success. Pinniped milk, like the milk of other marine mammals, is virtually devoid of carbohydrates. In fact, marine mammals really never ingest oral carbohydrates, so their inclusion in the fed diet is unnatural. Disorders of GI motility are not uncommon in artificially reared neonate seals and sea lions. Diarrhea, ileus, atony, and impaction have all been noted clinically. Carbohydrates included in the artificial diet have long been suspected to cause these problems. The microbial flora establishing itself in neonates, along with the brush border enzymes and anything else influenced by the biochemical milieu, may be disturbed by exposure to carbohydrate. experience with both natural and artificial systems has provided strong evidence for just how different the aquatic microbial ecology is between the two types. Evidence also indicates that these differences are manifested clinically as animal health issues. The author has suggested that this situation is similar to the \"Hygiene Hypothesis,\" as discussed in human medicine, and it has been termed the \"Aquatic Animal Hygiene Hypothesis.\" 8, 70 While many pinnipeds have been, and some continue to be, housed in fresh water systems, the author and colleagues believe that this is not the most appropriate environment for a marine mammal and that it undoubtedly places some significant physiologic stress on the animals. Much work is needed to revise water quality standards for marine mammals using science-based, sound data.\n\nPinnipeds are carnivorous and largely piscivorous, although most species have been documented to eat prey items other than fish. Walruses are well known to forage in the benthos for a variety of crustaceans and other invertebrates, making use of their prominent vibrissae and perhaps their tusks as well. Stomach contents and scats of phocids and otariids often contain remnants of invertebrates as well. Squids, octopoids, and crustaceans are commonly consumed, in addition to fishes of all sorts. In permanent collections, most pinnipeds are fed diets similar to those of cetaceans (dolphins and whales), generally a teleost fish-based ration comprising commercially available \"bait\" species such as herring (Clupeidae), mackerel (Scombridae), and smelt (Osmeridae). Squids are often included, but other invertebrates are offered on occasion, except to walruses. Captive pinnipeds appear to do well on these diets, and, in contrast to captive cetaceans, diseases with a presumed iatrogenic nutritional etiology have not been reported, with the exception of vitamin deficiencies. Thiamin deficiency was experimentally induced in seals in studies conducted 40 years ago and is still a concern today. 13,24 Over 30 years ago, vitamin E deficiency was experimentally induced in harp seals. 20 In addition, the interaction of vitamin A supplementation on vitamin E levels has been investigated in captive fur seals. 45 As a result, most facilities supplement rations fed to pinnipeds, with multivitamins, especially thiamin and vitamin A and E, at levels based on these original studies.\n\nFree-ranging wild pinnipeds do not consume supplements at all. Fat-soluble vitamins are abundant in marine fishes. One kilogram of herring may be expected to provide approximately 2000 international units (IU) of vitamin A, 8000 IU of vitamin D, and 40 to 60 IU of vitamin E, and marine mammals are expected to have a high capacity for storage of fat soluble vitamins. 74 So, if fresh-frozen, properly handled fish products are the base of the diet, supplementation may not be required at all, at least not daily. Proper handling of food fishes must include attention to time-temperature profiles. As a general rule, the shorter the time the product is held and the colder the temperature it is held at, the higher is the expected quality and the lower is the likelihood of nutrient degradation, particularly fatsoluble vitamin oxidation. It is this concern about degradation that apparently drives supplementation-not recognized deficiencies or toxicoses. All food handling from producer source selection, shipping, storage, \"breakout,\" feeding, and cleanup should be subjected to thorough oversight and review. A hazards analysis and critical control point (HACCP) approach, as used for human food service safety, is a wise approach and may, in fact, reduce the costs of future problems significantly. The advantage of reducing supplementation costs to one seventh of current costs by decreasing supplementation to once-weekly from once-daily is quite obvious. The responsible clinician should have a plan to monitor animal health status when any such changes are implemented.\n\nThe scientific literature is full of publications on the energetics of marine mammals, including investigations of hypothetical prey changes in association with species decline. One may easily find numerous formulas to calculate caloric requirements of various against the trunk with the thighs, knees, and shins so that the animal cannot gain purchase or stand. It is often useful to wet only the ends of the towel, providing weight that will facilitate wrapping the towel around the animal' s head. If the towel is not wet, the animal may often toss it easily; if the entire towel is wet, it may be difficult to achieve an effective wrap. Once the animal is immobilized in this fashion, the towel is removed from the nares and care taken to ensure the animal is breathing effectively. This method may be used in otariids and phocids alike (see Figure 44 -1). Otariids are much more agile and apt to pose a bite hazard, whereas phocids often thrash the hind flippers back and forth with gusto. Additional restrainers to assist with fore flipper positioning or hind end control will often be needed with larger individuals or those that are healthier. Conversely, malnourished, stranded neonatal seals and sea lions alike may often be safely restrained by one person experienced in the use of this technique.\n\nAs the size of the patient increases or the overall condition of the animal improves, it is more difficult and dangerous to restrain it. Animals weighing up to 70 or 80 kg (or larger ones by experienced personnel) may still be effectively restrained without chemical agents. For these animals, the most effective means, in the author' s experience is a small mesh conical net designed to fit over the animals head with space only for the muzzle to protrude ( Figure  44 -3). These nets are tossed over the animal, again with the help of boarders or, in the case of animals on the beach, with a net frame and handle. As the animal moves into the net, the net diameter narrows until only the muzzle of the animal is exposed and the fore flippers are effectively pinned against the trunk. Experienced personnel may grasp the back end of the net, take several wraps to further tighten the net against the fore flippers, and immobilize the animal effectively by lifting the back end. Additional restrainers may then assist in pinning the animal against the deck, again paying close attention to effective breathing in the animal. Many simple procedures and sample collections may be conducted in this manner. If further restraint is needed, the animal may then be anesthetized safely with an inhalant agent delivered via a face mask. This method has proven so effective in the author' s experience that it has replaced the use of \"Ridgway-Simpson\"-style squeeze cages that were once popular.\n\nChemical restraint is indicated if the patient is too large or obstreperous to safely restrain in a conical net.\n\nWith growing experience and success over the past few decades, chemical restraint of pinnipeds, including general anesthesia, has improved in effectiveness and safety. A robust and growing number of excellent reference resources are now available, and the reader is encouraged to consult these when planning a sedation or anesthesia procedure. 6, 31, 32, 37, 43 Table 44 -1 lists the current chemical induction protocols routinely used in otariids and phocids at TMMC. Current best practices continue to change rapidly with continued experience and retrospective analyses of past procedures. 64 A review of the literature and consultation with experienced practitioners will help obtain useful recommendations, for example, with regard to the use of atropine, the value of end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO 2 ) that would indicate controlled ventilation, and so on. The clinician is always responsible for making adjustments to plans in response to information at hand and literature review, keeping in mind that statistical significance does not always imply clinical significance or effectiveness. This appears to be particularly important when using injectable chemical agents in larger free-ranging otariids, using techniques such as remote delivery via darting. In the author' s experience, the differing responses to these combinations appear to be associated with the level of awareness or preexisting anxiety in the animal. Doses effectively inducing a deep sedation or a light plane of anesthesia in an animal that was darted while asleep and did not perceive a threat when roused by the dart, may not be as effective in a same-sized animal that is aroused or anxious before or during In health, pinnipeds acutely switch from suckling to solids without a transitional time of premasticated, regurgitated gruels fed by a parent, as in so many piscivorous birds. Young animals go from sucking milk one day to, in the case of phocids with a minimalistic maternal investment, fasting for a while, to eating solid fish. During attempts to artificially rear them at TMMC, often out of necessity, during a transition period gruel or \"fish mash\"-an unnatural diet-has been incorporated. Solid fish are generally swallowed whole or with little chewing in the normal weaned animal. The stomach is muscular and serves to masticate the food. Tube feeding gruel, although often necessary, may lead to motility disorders.\n\nLastly, \"hand rearing\" neonates increases the risk of abnormal socialization of the pup. For this reason, in rehabilitation facilities, most neonates are tube fed rather than trained to suckle a bottle delivered by hand. This is not a problem, of course, for animals destined to be placed in collections.\n\nInappropriate physical restraint of a pinniped is very dangerous for the personnel involved. These animals are agile, quick, and strong. They communicate with each other often by biting; they cannot effectively kick or scratch. Observing a couple of bull elephant seals or adult California sea lion males sparring for territory helps one realize how powerful and dangerous they can be. When the sheer mass attained by a mature male Steller sea lion or elephant seal is considered, it is easy to realize that safe, simple physical restraint of these animals is impossible. Even the smaller fur seals are notoriously quick in their movements and may bite even without provocation.\n\nAppropriate physical restraint is safe and effective. In rehabilitation or field settings, when working with wild animals, barriers in the form of \"crowding boards\" or fence panels are often used to \"herd\" animals from place to place. Tarps or umbrellas may also be perceived as visual menaces by animals on beaches and rookeries. Most seals and sea lions, when given the opportunity to move away from such barriers will do so. Only when cornered, with no option to escape, will larger animals challenge the barriers; handlers should therefore be prepared to meet this challenge. \"Boarders\" should always use care to avoid having their hands, fingers, and toes being exposed and injured by a bite or being crushed between the board and other solid object.\n\nIn permanent collections, animals are often trained to participate in husbandry tasks, including veterinary procedures. Otariids are frequently trained to climb on to a \"stand\" or platform or lie on a deck and \"target,\" with the nose on a manipulanda or the handler' s hand. Well-acclimated animals accustomed to these activities will often allow considerable manipulation and inspection, holding of flippers, opening of mouths, abdominal palpation, and veinipuncture. These \"medical behaviors\" are often favorite demonstrations at display facilities, illustrating to viewers the importance placed on animal care. However, caution should be used when relying on \"medical behaviors.\" Even the best-trained and most docile of individuals may be unpredictable and uncooperative when ill, the very time a thorough examination is most important. And even when not ill, these animals can be unpredictable. The author has seen, highly trained, highly reliable sea lions savagely bite familiar handlers who simply were not paying total attention to the animal.\n\nIn situations where the required clinical information or patient inspection cannot be accomplished by simple observation from a distance or with trained cooperation of the animal, some sort of restraint is needed. For animals weighing less than 30 kg of body weight, with the aid of boarders, an experienced restrainer may wrap a towel about the animal' s head to block its vision and the ability to bite. The animal may then be pinned to the deck by grasping at the base of the skull, straddling the animal, and holding the fore flippers is oriented vertically, in line with the glottis, and the insertion is timed with a breath. A gentle rotation of the tube as it is advanced will often help in its proper positioning. The cuff should be positioned just beyond the laryngeal cartilages, keeping in mind that the otariid carina is at the thoracic inlet. The patient' s vital signs should be monitored during the anesthesia period as in any terrestrial species. Airway gasses, core temperature, capillary oxygen saturation, and electrocardiography (ECG) are routinely included (Figure 44-5) . ETCO 2 partial pressures will the darting. The known or expected physiologic status of the animal must also be taken into account. Caution must be used if the animal is in poor condition. Hand injection or using a pole syringe device is often easily accomplished and may be more reliable than remote delivery via darting, particularly in phocids. Although darting has proven very useful and effective, substantial variation in dart delivery seems to exist. Induction times and responses tend to be longer and less predictable when the thigh muscles are used compared with the muscles of the neck and shoulders. It is the author' s hypothesis that this has to do with the presence of more fascial planes between the numerous muscle bodies of the thigh compared with the larger mass of muscles of the pectoral girdle and neck. More controlled studies are required to investigate additional drug combinations and delivery techniques.\n\nIn the author' s experience, the two biggest risks during chemical sedation and anesthesia of pinnipeds are airway maintenance and control of body temperature. During induction and recovery, it is imperative that the airway be maintained and monitored. The pinniped has robust distensible pharyngeal soft tissue that may easily obstruct and occlude the glottis when the animal' s level of awareness is diminished. If the animal gets into a position that may cause airway obstruction, it should be roused or repositioned immediately. On more than one occasion, sea lions have suffocated during induction in a transport or restraint cage because they folded up against the side. When manually restraining animals during induction, it must be ensured that nothing compresses the pharynx or trachea and that the airway is clear. The optimal position for the head and neck is extension with the mouth open. This position also facilitates endotracheal (ET) intubation (Figure 44-4) . A rope or cord loop is placed around the maxilla behind canine teeth and another around the mandible again caudal to canine teeth to hold the head and neck straight out and the mouth open. With larger animals on the deck, it may be necessary to straddle the neck first and have the animal facing the intubator. A laryngoscope may be used to depress the base of the tongue to visualize the glottis. In some smaller animals, particularly phocids, it may not be possible to visualize the glottis, and the tube is best guided by a gloved hand through the pharynx and an extended finger inserted into the glottis. The bevel of the ET tube techniques for research purposes such as biopsies and transmitter implantation rather than on clinical case management. Typical or routine surgical procedures are expected to vary with institutional mission and animal use. In permanent collections, elective (nondiagnostic or therapeutic) surgeries are limited. Some facilities routinely castrate male pinnipeds, and this may be the most common elective surgical procedure performed. The author' s preferred method for bilateral orchidectomy is a single prescrotal incision and closed technique as described for domestic dogs. Methods for both subcutaneous and intraabdominal device implantation, including observations of species differences in results, have been described. 26, 36 Various non-elective surgical procedures for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes have been reported in the literature or described in conference proceedings. Ophthalmic surgery and dental surgery are the most commonly performed surgical procedures in most permanent collections, followed by biopsy of masses and other lesions. In rehabilitation settings, it appears that surgical incision and drainage of abscesses, with or without indwelling drain placement, is very common, along with debridement of traumatic wounds (shark bite wounds, blunt force trauma, gunshot trauma, conspecific trauma, etc.). Numerous orthopedic surgeries have been performed, but in the author' s experience, most orthopedic surgeries are salvage procedures such as amputations and arthrodeses. Indications for GI surgeries are fewer than in terrestrial animals. The most common appears to be foreign body removal. Most GI foreign bodies do not pass the gastric pylorus, as discussed previously (the walrus, again, the exception here) and may be retrieved under endoscopic guidance per os, precluding the need for laparotomy or laparoscopy. However, laparoscopy and laparotomy are easily performed on most small pinnipeds by using methods described for dogs, and although indications for each exist, a laparoscopic approach is preferred when possible. This author has successfully performed biopsy of the diaphragm, liver, kidney, intraabdominal lymph nodes, neoplastic masses, and other lesions under laparoscopic visualization in both phocid and otariid patients. 7\n\nThe application of fundamental techniques in veterinary surgery is well suited to pinniped surgery, and the surgeon should strive to optimize these aspects of every procedure.\n\nBecause these animals are adapted to an aquatic environment, a few special considerations are worth noting. The application of postoperative bandages-to facilitate tissue stabilization and hemostasis or to reduce dead space by compression-is occasionally helpful but must be weighed against the disadvantages of bandaging a pinniped. Overnight bandaging should be considered when hemostasis or dead space reduction is required, for example, following major amputations; however, in general, providing access to water as soon as possible following surgery is preferred over \"dry docking\" the animal. These animals appear to be most comfortable and rest best when allowed access to water. If restricted from water, they frequently appear anxious and do not rest, which increases the risk of heat prostration. They also are prone to soiling the surgical incision sites with feces and urine; if the animal is misted or hosed to provide cooling, the bandages become wet anyway. It is often very difficult to fashion a bandage that will effectively stay dry and stay in place on an animal' s appendage or trunk. Veterinary ophthalmologists and dentists will frequently recommend \"dry docking\" the animal for up to several weeks postoperatively. In this author' s experience, complications of wound healing are much reduced when animals are allowed access to water within 24 hours of surgery, if not immediately.\n\nClosure methods and suture materials to facilitate primary intention closure are entirely the surgeon' s preference. All available materials appear to be well tolerated by most pinnipeds. The author generally elects to use a monofilament absorbable material in most tissues and layers, including the skin, as these may be left in place. Pinnipeds appear to possess a remarkable propensity for wound healing. Major soft tissue wounds that do not allow for primary frequently be higher than expected in similar-sized terrestrial animals; values into the 70 to 80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) range are not uncommon in uncomplicated anesthesia events. The clinician should resist the temptation to drive these down but rather watch trends over time closely and ensure that ventilation-perfusion mismatch is not developing from positional atelectasis. Otariids will usually spontaneously ventilate well and may be easily and effectively maintained by periodically assisting a breath and \"sighing\" to a positive pressure of 20 to 25 mm Hg. However, obese animals often do not effectively ventilate and should be controlled with mechanical means. Healthy pinniped lungs tolerate higher positive inspiratory pressures than by those of terrestrial animals. They are normally exposed to incredible transthoracic pressures during diving. Caution should be used in animals with presumed pulmonary parenchymal disease such as verminous pneumonia, as bullae, mediastinal and subcutaneous emphysema, and, less frequently, pneumothorax may be induced.\n\nCore body temperature of pinnipeds under general anesthesia will generally trend close to ambient temperature. Thus, in a typical surgical suite on a stainless steel table, the animals will tend to become hypothermic. The smaller the animal and the poorer the body condition, the more likely it is that clinically significant hypothermia may develop. Supplemental heat with a circulating water blanket under the animal or a warm air blanket covering the animal should be provided. Caution should be exercised in the use of hot water bottles. The glaborous skin of the flippers does not tolerate heat from standard hot water bottles or warmed intravenous fluid bags, and serious thermal burns to flippers have been caused by their use.\n\nIn contrast, larger animals and obese animals may develop hyperthermia, particularly if exposed to the hot sun. An adult male sea lion lying on a dark rocky beach in the mid-day sun is prone to a hyperthermic event. Caution should also be exercised during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of these larger or overconditioned animals, as they do sometimes get heated because of the magnet.\n\nECG signals from unipolar limb leads are easily obtained to monitor heart rate and rhythm with standard equipment. Alligatorstyle clips may be applied in the axillae and a reference ground at the pelvic limbs. Wetting the clips with alcohol or saline facilitates good electrode contact. Adhesive contacts may be used but offer no real advantage. The clinician should be aware that only heart rate and rhythm information may be interpreted from the signals. Waveforms are typical but amplitude varies with lead placement, patient positioning, and thoracic excursions. If cardiac contractility or chamber size is in question, diagnostic ultrasonography should be employed to evaluate the heart.\n\nWith practice, vascular pressures may be directly monitored by catheter placement into a jugular vein (central venous pressure) or radial artery (mean arterial pressure) with ultrasonographic guidance; however, placement is often challenging and may take as long as the surgical or diagnostic procedure, requiring the general anesthesia. Diagnostics and surgery should never be delayed simply to place catheters. Indirect pressure monitoring has not proven useful to date.\n\nDuring the recovery period, a pinniped patient should be allowed to regain a high level of awareness prior to extubation. A vigorous response to airway stimulation by a slight manipulation of the tube is recommended prior to removing the tube. After the patient is extubated, airway patency and effective ventilation must be ensured. It is often useful to stimulate the animal during the recovery period from time to time by grasping the nose or \"tweaking\" the vibrissae until unsafe to do so. Spraying the animal with a robust stream of water, focusing on the nose and face, will also assist in helping patients recover from general anesthesia or deep sedation.\n\nThis author is unaware of any comprehensive review of surgical cases or the indications for surgery in pinnipeds. Surgical techniques reported in the scientific literature are heavily biased toward field and tactile? (Response to auditory stimuli may be useful as an indicator of prior domoic acid intoxication. 12 ) Are any swellings or discharges apparent? Can the animal bear weight on all extremities? Is any asymmetry in gait present? Significant observed concerns are useful to target additional inspection under restraint, manual or chemical, as needed. Care should be taken to ensure a thorough inspection and to avoid overlooking something important.\n\nThe consistency of feces from healthy pinnipeds is quite variable. Stool is not regularly solid or liquid but may be both. Defecation is frequently stimulated when the animal enters the water or is sprayed or misted with a hose. The diagnosis of diarrhea may be difficult and should not be based on fecal consistency alone.\n\nAuscultation is of limited sensitivity and specificity compared with those in most terrestrial animals. Animals with significant pulmonary disease may have presumably normal lung sounds. True adventitial sounds are much less common in pinnipeds than in terrestrial animals. Care should be taken to evaluate air movement in all quadrants and symmetry between one hemi-thorax and the other, but if pulmonary pathology is suspected, diagnostic imaging should be considered. Radiographic references are now available for several species and anatomic regions. 17, 50 Careful attention should be paid when attempting to palpate the lymph nodes of otariid patients. Submandibular, superficial cervical, axillary and popliteal nodes may often be palpated with practice and are often involved in lymphadenopathies. Palpation of the sublumbar lymph nodes should be attempted. They are generally not palpable if normal but are often involved early in cases of metastatic urogenital carcinoma. External genitalia should be inspected, including extending the penis from within the sheath to look for plaques that may be indicative of early neoplastic lesions. It is possible to palpate some abdominal structures of tractable or sedated sea lions and fur seals: both kidneys, the caudal margin of the liver, and sometimes a turgid urinary bladder. Pregnancy and neoplastic masses, both primary and metastatic, may often be identified with careful palpation. In contrast, it is usually not possible to effectively palpate the abdomen of phocids.\n\nFollowing a thorough observation and direct inspection, obtaining whole blood for routine hematology and clinical chemistry is most valuable for assessing the health status of any marine mammal. These animals are very good at masking signs of illness. Hematology intention healing in other animals often fare remarkably well in pinnipeds when left to heal by secondary intention, which often includes significant loss of soft tissue, even that resulting in bone exposure. When in doubt, conservative reconstruction and diligent monitoring for complications should always be considered before more radical attempts at repair or euthanasia. Massive soft tissue injury will often granulate, contract, remodel and reepithelialize at an impressive rate (Figure 44-6 ).\n\nMore investigations have been conducted on the pharmacokinetics of persistent organic pollutants and biotoxins in marine mammals than on medications used in clinical treatment. The literature on clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in pinnipeds is woefully sparse. As a result, almost all drug use in these animals is extrapolated from data or experience gained with other species, and \"response to therapy\" is often the best the clinician can do. Adverse effects, sometimes fatal, have been seen, and usually these are not published. The wise practitioner will consult the literature, even though it is sparse, and consult with colleagues when deciding on a drug treatment plan.\n\nFortunately, in most cases, pinnipeds appear to at least tolerate drugs, doses, schedules, and routes of administration based on recommendations for dogs. Exceptions do exist, particularly vasoactive drugs such as phenothiazine derivatives and \u03b1 2 -agonists, which appear to interfere with the complex physiology associated with hemostasis during dives. These must be used with extreme caution and close patient monitoring. Azole antifungals have also been implicated in a fatal hepatopathy of a California sea lion treated with a dosage schedule presumably extrapolated from guidelines for dosages for domestic dogs. 21 Extrapyramidal side effects of the major tranquilizer haloperidol were noted in several collection sea lions being treated for chronic regurgitation. 57\n\nThe physical assessment of a pinniped patient begins with thorough observation from a distance. What is the animal' s overall appearance? What is its body condition? Does it respond to stimuli, both auditory \n\nseroconvert. These viruses have been associated with outbreaks of central nervous system disease or adrenal disease in rehabilitation facilities. 35 Influenza A viruses have caused significant epizootics in seals along the Northeastern coast of the United States. Subtypes H7N7, H4N5, H4N6, H3N3, and, most recently, H3N8 have been identified in these seals. Much attention has been focused on the seal as a potential intermediary host in the transmission of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus from avian hosts to humans, particularly the H3N8 strain isolated in the most recent and unusual mortality event in New England. 54 Poxvirus infections causing typical lesions are common in young pinnipeds presented to rehabilitation facilities. The verrucous lesions are generally self-limiting and are unusual in mature animals. West Nile virus and eastern equine encephalitis virus infections have been documented in captive harbor seals. 16, 46 A number of other viruses have been isolated from pinniped samples or identified through immunologic or metagenomic methods. Some of the viruses thus identified are adenoviruses, anelloviruses, coronavirus, astroviruses, and parvoviruses. The clinical significance of finding these viruses is often inconclusive. Very likely, disease associated with these viruses is multi-factorial, and additional risk factors are unknown. A recent metagenomic exploration of the fecal virome of rehabilitating California sea lions characterized previously undescribed ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viruses, including sapeloviruses, sapoviruses, noroviruses, and bocaviruses. 42\n\nLeptospirosis is well known as being endemic in California sea lions along the California coast and continues to intrigue disease ecologists. Factors that contribute to periodic epizootic outbreaks from background prevalence are still not completely understood and are under intense investigation. Clinical disease in these animals is most often due to infection with a L. interrogans pomona servovar with a genotype that appears to be unique to sea lions. 75 Clinical signs are attributed to acute interstitial nephritis. Early and aggressive fluid and antibiotic therapies have resolved clinical disease in many animals. Rates and periodicity of shedding in free-ranging subclinical or recovered \"carrier\" animals are currently being sought through field investigation.\n\nTuberculosis is a widely recognized contagious zoonotic disease of otariid pinnipeds, resulting from infection with Mycobacterium pinnipedii. Cases have been reported from Australia, Europe, New Zealand, and South America and include outbreaks and in which the pathogen spread from pinnipeds to Malayan tapirs (Tapirus indicus), bactrian camels, (Camelus bactrianus bactrianus), and crested porcupines (Hystrix cristata). Additional species reported to have been experimentally infected with M. pinnipedii include guinea pigs, rabbits, a Brazilian tapir (Tapirus terrestris), a llama (llama glama), a western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), and two feline species (Panthera uncia, Panthera pardus orientalis). Transmission to humans in zoologic settings has also been documented. 39 Mycobacteriosis in pinnipeds appears to be absent at present in North America. One case report described a mycobacterial infection in a captive California sea lion; however, the isolate was identified as M. smegmatis. 29 The obvious implications of this disease should be considered when making management and husbandry decisions.\n\nInfection with marine origin Brucella sp. has received a lot of scientific attention recently. Evidence of exposure to or infection with Brucella sp. in marine mammals appears to be widespread and global in distribution, although the clinical significance is unknown. Marine mammal biovars of Brucella sp. are genetically distinct from terrestrial biovars. Cases of human brucellosis caused by marine origin isolates have been documented. 66 Clinical disease in pinnipeds appears to be less common than in cetaceans; however, this disease may have an impact on conservation efforts. For example, during development of a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) for marine origin Brucella sp. antibodies, 16 of 28 (57%) Hawaiian and chemistry results are invaluable for decision making and may be the only real objective data easily obtained. Numerous available references describe expected parameter values, vascular access sites, and methods for routine blood sampling.\n\nIf an effective clinical plan-diagnostic, therapeutic, or bothcannot be made with the results of observation, inspection, CBC count, and chemistry panel, diagnostic imaging is usually the next step.\n\nCommon things occur commonly but in pinniped medicine common things vary with environment. Typical concerns and illnesses seen in a rehabilitation facility are almost never seen in collections. Collection animals tend to experience longer life spans and develop ageassociated disease conditions not often seen in rehabilitation settings. Dermatopathies and ocular diseases appear to have a higher prevalence in collections, likely because of environmental conditions such as water quality and exposure to ultraviolet radiation. In managed collections, many skin conditions that are deemed insignificant in free-ranging animals create concern in animal care staff or visitors and are brought to the attention of the attending clinician. The desire and need for a diagnosis should be weighed against potential health risks and behavioral disruption caused by diagnostic and treatment plans.\n\nWild pinnipeds have co-evolved with a myriad disease agents and parasites with infectious potential; however, the presence of an agent does not mean disease. Balance in the host-agent-environment triad is the normal situation. When this balance is upset, disease may result. A few agents and diseases are frequently seen in rehabilitation centers and frequently cause concern to collection managers, and these warrant a brief mention.\n\nCaliciviruses are ubiquitous in the marine environment, and many serovars have been reported. In otariids, caliciviral disease varies, depending on the strain, from mild GI signs to severe vesicular stomatitis and dermatitis of the glaborous skin of the appendages. Abortion and encephalitis have also been reported. Morbidity is moderate and mortality low. Isolates from clinical cases were experimentally transmitted to swine and caused a disease indistinguishable from vesicular exanthema of swine. 69 Managers of collections that include otariids and swine should be aware of this.\n\nPhocine distemper virus (PDV) has caused very large, very-welldocumented epizootics in seals in Europe. Phocids have been experimentally infected with canine distemper virus (CDV) and vaccinated against this pathogen as well. PDV has been documented to cause disease in harbor seals in the northeast United States and the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada. 19 CDV in one captive born California sea lion in Europe has been reported. CDV infection was confirmed in that animal by immunohistochemistry and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), although the authors speculated that it may have been an incidental finding. 2 Serologic surveys have detected anti-morbilliviral antibodies from pinnipeds from the Antarctic to the Canadian arctic. As many as 50% of sampled fur seals on the Pribilof Islands tested were seropositive (Gulland, personal communication) . Morbilliviral nucleic acid identified as PDV has been detected in sea otters in Alaska. 25 To this author' s knowledge, serologic evidence from the eastern Pacific, including the California coast of the United States and Baja Mexico, is sparse, and no clinical morbilliviral disease has been reported from this region. Considering the high resident population of (presumably susceptible) marine mammals in this area, the introduction of morbilliviruses could precipitate a devastating epizootic.\n\nPhocine herpesviruses appear to be ubiquitous in the environment, and essentially all free-ranging seals, sea lions, and walrus treatment. The goal again is to \"tip-the-balance\" in favor of the patient when the parasites are a significant part of the disease process-not to completely eliminate the burden. When animals are destined to move from the wild to a permanent collection, consideration should again be given to the risks versus the benefits of therapy. The life cycles of many of these parasites have not been confirmed, but most are likely indirect and require an intermediate host. When animals in collections are fed previously frozen food items, metazoan parasites are presumed killed, so these animals will not be reinfected. If no intermediate host is present in the system the animals are housed in, the infection will likely resolve over time and with appropriate immune response of the host. Anthementic treatment coincident with the stressor of a recent environmental change may be deleterious or even fatal.\n\nConsider the common filarid nematode of California sea lions, Acanthocheilonema odenhali. Microfilariae of this worm are frequently found in blood samples from animals presenting for rehabilitation. The adults live in the fascial planes and subcutis of the neck and axillae and do not cause disease. The microfilaria may reportedly be discriminated from those of the potentially pathogenic A. spirocauda and Dirofilaria immitis; however, in clinical practice, this is difficult and impractical. 14 To this author' s knowledge, disease caused by D. immitis has never been reported in a free-ranging pinniped and infection with A. odenhali is common. The decision to pursue accurate identification of the microfilaria (they appear to cross-react with some commercially available assays for D. immitis but not all) or to pursue clearance of the microfilaria with a microfilaricide should be made on the basis of associated risks.\n\nMost potential noninfectious causes of morbidity and mortality have been discussed in preceding sections of this chapter. It is worth reiterating a few points here. Risks inherent with disturbances of thermoregulation are constantly present in pinniped patients. The likelihood of hyperthermia or hypothermia should always be evaluated and a means for prevention or response incorporated into the diagnostic or treatment plan.\n\nMalnutrition is perhaps the single most common reason for pinniped patients to present to rehabilitation centers. Not enough is known about the optiml carbohydrate-free artificial ration to use in various stages of treatment. \"Gastric mastication\" may be an important factor in normal digestion and assimilation in these animals. Anything artificial the patient is exposed to during rehabilitation, including the physical environment, pharmaceuticals, and rations, may put artificial selection pressure on the microbiome and may interrupt normal physiochemical development as well. Despite these challenges, many animals have recovered with supportive care and assist-feeding with a variety of ration recipes in use.\n\nEntanglements with or ingestions of human-made debris are a common problem. Frequently, the entanglement is around the neck and has been present for some time before the animal is reported. These animals tend to be otherwise healthy, often ostracized by conspecifics and wary of predators. As a result, they may be difficult and dangerous to capture until they are so debilitated that their prognosis is poor. Remote sedation with new drug cocktails is showing great promise of helping these animals. 48 Intestinal foreign bodies are uncommon. If an object passes through the pyloric sphincter, it may pass all the way to the anus, except in the walrus. Gastric foreign bodies are not uncommon but are rarely emergencies. Pinnipeds, like most cetacean species, appear to be able to voluntarily induce emesis and \"purge\" the stomach periodically. Emesis may sometimes be induced with gastric irritants such as hydrogen peroxide or mustard slurries but less reliably than in canine patients. Endoscopic retrieval is indicated if the object is likely to cause physical damage or toxicosis. Terminal fishing tackle, hooks, lines, and sinkers may pose unique challenges, depending on their location and degree of embedding. Radiography should be performed on any animal seen with external terminal tackle attached to evaluate for the presence of swallowed tackle as well.\n\nmonk seal samples were interpreted as positive, but interpretation of assay results continues to be hindered by sensitivity and specificity information that is limited and difficult to deduce. 47 The potential fecal pathogens Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp. have been isolated from many free-ranging and stranded pinnipeds along the coasts of California and Scotland. In one study, 87% of elephant seal pups sampled harbored Salmonella spp. 63 Salmonella spp. also isolated from the feces of 2 of 13 sampled South American sea lions (Otaria flavescens) without clinical signs of disease. 65 Clinical disease in pinnipeds due to infection with these agents appears to be rare, however, they could serve as sources for zoonotic transmission.\n\nRecently, a case of wound infection in a rehabilitating harbor seal caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was documented. 22 A Mycoplasma species has been identified as responsible for soft tissue and joint infections in numerous sea lions. 30 Disease caused by infection with this organism sometimes has an insidious onset and often involves the connective tissues of the appendages. This disease is not responsive to cell wall-inhibiting antibiotics, which are frequently used as first-choice agents to treat many wound and soft tissue infections. Mycoplasmal infection should be considered in nonresponsive cases of presumed soft tissue infection.\n\nMycotic disease appears to be of lower prevalence in most pinniped populations than in other marine mammal species. In rehabilitation facilities, evidence of fungal dermatopathy is often seen in California sea lions. The lesions are multi-focal maculae characterized by discrete circular hyperpigmentation and patchy alopecia of differing diameters. Less commonly, active lesions and a pronounced suppurative inflammation of the skin are seen. Cytology and culture of these active lesions have identified a Trychophyton of unknown species. Attempts to type this fungus are currently ongoing.\n\nDisseminated infection with Coccidiodes immitis is also regularly seen along the California coast of the United States, and risk of exposure to humans should always be considered. This organism has been declared a select agent by the USDA, and infectious arthroconidia have been detected in tissues from necropsy specimens.\n\nMany other sporadic disseminated fungal infections and dermatopathies have been reported, often presumably exacerbated by environmental conditions, antibiotic therapy, or immunosuppression. 34\n\nA large and growing body of evidence suggests exposure to, infection with, and disease caused by protozoan parasites in free-ranging and captive pinnipeds. Otariids, phocids, and obenids all appear to be susceptible to infection with Toxoplasma, Neosporia, and Sarcocystis spp. 18 Antemortem diagnosis is supported by serologic assays and biopsy, and several successfully treated confirmed cases have been reported. 7 Recently, several novel coccidian organisms have been identified in the intestinal tracts of California sea lions. Both sexual and asexual coccidian stages were identified in enterocytes, suggesting that sea lions may be definitive hosts and that these organisms may be pathogenic in other pinniped species. 10\n\nCestodes, nematodes, trematodes, and acanthocephalans are routinely found in free-ranging pinnipeds. The pathology associated with these taxa is quite varied. Verminous pneumonia is a widespread, well-recognized, and debilitating condition in many young pinnipeds. In contrast, ova, larvae, or adults are often found incidentally during diagnostic workups. The astute clinician will evaluate the weight of evidence that these organisms are involved in the disease process against the potential for an adverse response to treatment. Anthelmentic administration to an animal in poor condition with a substantial lungworm burden, for instance, may incite a fatal inflammatory response. In rehabilitation settings, animals destined for release will be reexposed and presumably reinfected following diagnosis of pregnancy may be difficult in early gestation. Pregnancy usually results in only one offspring; twins are rare. In managed collections, the reduction of environmental and nutritional stressors may lead to earlier reproductive maturity than in the wild. Two-year old sea lions have sired pups. Contraception may be accomplished by surgical, social grouping, or chemical means. The use of depot formulations of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs in adult pinnipeds has resulted in local site reactions. Surgical contraception in females by laparoscopic ovariectomy is feasible in most species but is not commonly performed. The application of advanced reproductive technologies such as hormonal control of cycles and artificial insemination appears to be uncommon in pinnipeds, with the possible exception of walruses. Some work has been done by at least one group to manipulate both male and female reproductive cycles of walruses with the aim of increasing pregnancy rates. 51\n\nPeriodic regular health assessments, including routine CBC counts with differentials and serum chemistry profiles, may detect the onset of some disease conditions at an early stage; however, more often, observations made by caregivers are the first indication of medical problems. Open and frequent communication among keepers, trainers, animal care staff, and the veterinary team is critical to early detection of health problems. All instances of unexplained change in body condition, behavior, appetite, or attitude should be evaluated.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, providing an optimal physical environment, with special attention to the water quality and to the specialized anatomic, behavioral, and physiologic adaptations of these animals to the aquatic environs is arguably the most important preventive measure that should be taken in managed collections. Particular attention should be paid to the risks associated with restraint and confinement, namely, hyperthermia and asphyxiation, especially during transportation of pinnipeds from one location to another.\n\nSome institutions have elected to vaccinate pinnipeds against rabies, WNV, and CDV with commercially available vaccines, and most administer a heartworm preventive agent when D. immitis infection is endemic in dogs in the area.\n\nBehavioral abnormalities are sometimes significant medical problems. The ability of pinnipeds to induce voluntary emesis appears to be exploited by some individual animals and comprise a displacement behavior that may frustrate keepers, trainers, and caregivers alike. It may also be confused with significant occult medical problems. 71 Stereotypical swim patterns sometimes lead to patchy alopecia or excoriations. Patchy alopecia has also been a feature of some unusual morbidity and mortality in free-ranging animals with unknown etiology. 44 Chewing on or gnawing at enclosure structures has led to significant dental disease in many captive-born pinnipeds.\n\nNeoplasia affects both free-ranging and captive pinnipeds. Urogenital carcinoma affects approximately 1 of 6 adult California sea lions necropsied at TMMC and is a discrete disease syndrome in stranded sea lions. Several risk factors for this disease have been identified, and an international consortium is investigating the etiopathogenesis that includes both infectious and noninfectious factors. 59 Clinical signs include varying degrees of posterior paresis to paralysis and perineal edema. Sublumbar lymphadenopathy is often detected early in the course. No treatment is available. Collection animals are infrequently affected by this carcinoma, although wild-origin animals have developed the disease in captivity. Other neoplasms affecting pinnipeds are scattered types and sporadic in nature.\n\nThe most significant clinically recognized toxicosis of pinnipeds is domoic acid intoxication of free-ranging animals off the California coast. This harmful algal toxin mimics the neurotransmitter glutamate and is biomagnified up the food web. Acute and chronic forms of the intoxication are recognized, and clinical signs at presentation range from subtle behavioral deficits to status epilepticus. Treatment is supportive. Epileptic animals are not candidates for release from rehabilitation centers; they do not make attractive display animals and are generally euthanized. In utero exposure and intoxication of the pups of pregnant dams may lead to serious neurodevelopmental disorders. Pups presumably exposed in utero have developed seizure disorders later in life, and some evidence indicates that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is disrupted in intoxicated animals. 27 It is possible that many yearling-class pinnipeds that present to rehabilitation facilities have cognitive or other neurologic deficits as a result of in utero exposure to domoic acid and that this has contributed to their failure to thrive. Some of these animals end up in managed collections, and a careful history should be taken by the attending veterinarian.\n\nRecognition that these animals are excellent sentinels of the health of the oceanic and near-shore ecosystems has led to numerous investigations into the relationship between contaminant burdens and morbidity or mortality. The scientific literature contains numerous publications that examine the possible connection between burdens of heavy metals, organochlorines, endocrine disruptors, and other anthropogenic contaminants and everything from dermatopathies, reproductive failure, neoplasia, neurologic deficits, and death. Reports of clinical intoxications of collection animals are, in contrast, uncommon. Exposure to toxicants used in pest control programs or to potentially toxic items that are inadvertently introduced into exhibits, such as lead objects or zinc containing coins, should be considered in cases of suspected intoxication.\n\nFor a thorough description of pinniped reproduction, consult available references (specifically the excellent text Biology of Marine Mammals by Reynolds and Rommel [eds.] 58 ). Only brief comments considered salient to typical collection and rehabilitation medicine are mentioned here. Not all species have been studied in any detail, but wild pinnipeds generally display a strong population synchrony in reproductive events, and photoperiod is likely a strong influence of timing. All pinnipeds exhibit delayed implantation, and as a result,"}
