{"title": "Cross-reactivity of antibody against SARS-coronavirus nucleocapsid protein with IL-11", "body": "The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 has spread to 29 countries, infected more than 8000 people, and resulted in 916 deaths worldwide [1] . A new type of coronavirus is identified as the causative agent for SARS [2] [3] [4] [5] . Hematological studies indicated that SARS patients elicited a strong antibody response to viral nucleocapsid protein [6, 7] and a moderate antibody response to viral spike protein and other viral envelop proteins in some patients [6, 8] . In addition, phage-displayed peptide library has been used to profile the binding epitopes of anti-SARS-CoV antibodies from convalescent serum, identifying peptide sequences of various viral proteins including nucleocapsid, spike, and proteins of predicted open reading frames (ORFs) [9, 10] .\n\nLines of evidence suggest that the anti-spike (anti-S) antibodies can neutralize SARS-CoV and block its infection of cells [11] [12] [13] [14] . A protective effect on virus infection has been reported for non-neutralizing antibodies against hepatitis virus nucleocapsid protein [15] ; however, the pathophysiological roles of anti-nucleocapsid (anti-N) antibodies in SARS patients are largely unknown.\n\nIn order to gain a better understanding of the characteristics of anti-N antibodies, an scFv library was constructed from mouse immunized with heat-inactivated SARS-CoVinfected Vero E6 cell lysate. Panel of anti-N scFvs was derived from the library. Intriguingly, one of the anti-N scFvs cross-reacted with interleukin 11 (IL-11) which is a bone marrow stroma-derived cytokine and a member of the interleukin 6 (IL-6) cytokine family [16, 17] .\n\nCloning, expression, and purification of SCoV-N protein. The full-length SARS-CoV nucleocapsid cDNA was amplified by PCR from the SARS-CoV genomic library (CUHK-W1) and cloned into the NdeI and EcoRI sites of pAC28m vector which places a His 6 -tag at the N terminus of the protein. Expression of the N protein was induced by adding 0.1 mM IPTG for 6 h at 25\u00b0C in Escherichia coli strain B834. Bacterial cells were lysed by sonication and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Nucleocapsid proteins in soluble fraction were purified using a combination of Ni-NTA agarose chromatography (Qiagen) and S-200 size exclusion chromatography (Amersham Biosciences).\n\nSARS-CoV-infected vero E6 cell lysate. Vero cells (ATCC CRL-1586) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (Gibco) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 in a humidified incubator. The Vero cells were infected with a SARS-CoV strain (CUHK-W1) for 16-48 h, and the cells were lysed in a Hepes buffer (10 mM; pH 7.0) supplemented with 40 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 5% glycerol, 0.2% NP40, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, and 1\u00b7 protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). After removing cell debris by centrifugation, the virus-infected cell lysate was heated for 30 min at 55\u00b0C to inactivate any live virus. The heat-inactivated cell lysate was then kept at \u00c070\u00b0C until use.\n\nScFv library construction and biopanning. ScFv antibodies were prepared as described previously [18] . The NotI-and SfiI-restricted scFv antibodies were then cloned into pCANTAB 5E phagemid vector (Amersham). Library was constructed by chemical transformation using competent TG1 E. coli. Subsequently, log-phase TG1 transformants were superinfected with M13KO7 helper phage (Amersham) in a multiplicity of infection (moi) ratio of 3:1. Pool of scFv-phages produced in overnight culture was purified by polyethylene glycol precipitation (20% PEG8000 and 2.5 M NaCl). Purified phages were resuspended in 4 ml of a pre-blocking buffer (1\u00b7 PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.01% NaN 3 , 0.1% BSA, and 10% non-fat milk) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min before panning process. Phages (0.5 ml/well) were panned against immobilized antigen in a 24-well plate of which each well was pre-coated with 7.5 lg of recombinant N protein in 0.5 ml of carbonate coating buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C. After incubation at room temperature for 2 h with gentle shaking, bound scFv-phages were eluted with 100 ll of 0.1 M glycine-HCl, pH 2.2. After 10 min acid incubation at room temperature, the eluant was neutralized with 10 ll of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Specificity of eluted phage clones was confirmed by phage-ELISA.\n\nPhage-ELISA. Phage-ELISA was carried out in a 96-well ELISA plate, and each well was coated with 50 ll of a carbonate coating buffer, pH 9.6, containing 2 lg of recombinant N protein overnight at 4\u00b0C. After incubation with 100 ll scFv-phages at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, bound phages were detected by incubation with 100 ll of a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-M13 mouse antibody (Amersham) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. Activity of horseradish peroxidase was measured by a colorimetric method with o-phenylenediamine/H 2 O 2 as substrates. Color was allowed to develop for 1 h at room temperature, and absorbance at 450 nm was measured with a lQuant micro-plate reader (Bio-Tek).\n\nNucleotide sequence analysis. Nucleotide sequence determinations were performed by dye-terminator cycle sequencing using Beckman CEQ DTCS Kit as recommended by the manufacturer. Sequencing products were separated by capillary gel-electrophoresis and the nucleotide sequence was read by Beckman CEQ2000 sequencer (Beckman Coulter). Sequences obtained were compared with NCBI IgBLAST, and multiple sequence alignment was performed by ClustalW from EMBL-EBI server with the following default conditions: matrix, BLOSUM; gap opening penalty, 10.0; gap extension penalty, 0.05; gap separation penalty, 8; maxdiv, default; no end gap separation penalty. Alignment in the CDR3 was further adjusted manually in accordance with the physical property of amino acid residues.\n\nWestern blot analysis of STAT 3 phosphorylation. IEC-18 cells (ATCC CRL-1589) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 0.1 U/ml bovine insulin (Sigma) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 in a humidified incubator. For STAT 3 phosphorylation analysis, the IEC-18 cells were grown to confluence in 24-well plates. The cells were then serumstarved by reducing FCS supplement to 0.5% for 24 h followed by to 0.01% for 12 h. The cells were then exposed to 5 nM IL-11 (PeproTech EC) for 60 min at 37\u00b0C in the absence or presence of various individual anti-N scFv clones (9 \u00b7 10 10 cfu) in a final volume of 100 ll. The cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl; pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 1\u00b7 protease inhibitor cocktail), boiled for 10 min, and then stored at \u00c020\u00b0C until use. Proteins of cell lysate (50 mg) were separated in a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel and then electro-transfer to a nitrocellulose paper. The protein blot was probed with a 1000-fold diluted mouse monoclonal anti-phospho STAT 3 (Tyr 705) antibody (Cell Signalling) together with a 10,000-fold diluted mouse monoclonal anti-b actin antibody (Sigma) for 16-18 h at room temperature in an immunoblotting buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl; pH 7.4, 0.02% NaN 3 , 80 mM NaCl, 20 mM CaCl 2 , and 5% skimmed milk powder). After incubating with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse Ig secondary antibody (2000-fold diluted, Zymed) for 2 h at room temperature, the immunoreactive bands were visualized by incubating with NBT/BCIP as suggested by the manufacturer (Boehringer-Mannheim).\n\nRecombinant nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV (SCoV-N) was cloned from the SARS-CoV genomic library (CUHK-W1) by PCR and tag with a His 6 -tag at its N-terminus for purification. Expression of recombinant N proteins in E. coli was construct-dependent and induced by addition of IPTG. Purified recombinant N protein was characterized with a molecular mass of $52 kDa (Fig. 1A) . The purified recombinant His 6 -N protein was recognized by convalescent serum of SARS patients but not by healthy subject (Fig. 1B) , suggesting that the recombinant N protein shares the same antigenicity as the native viral N protein.\n\nTo profile the anti-N antibody response, we constructed a phage-displayed scFv library from a mouse that immunized with heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cell lysate. As evidenced by Western blot analysis against the recombinant nucleocapsid protein, anti-N response in immunized mouse was detectable 8 days after the first immunization and displaying strong antibody response after two more boost injections (Fig. 2) . No immunoreactive response was observed in mouse without immunization (Fig. 2) , suggesting that the antibody response was induced by the heat-inactivated SARS-coronavirus, and consistent with the previous finding that inactivated SARS-CoV induces high level of neutralizing antibody in mice [19] .\n\nAfter the construction of phage-displayed scFv library, anti-N scFvs were retrieved by bio-panning the library (3 \u00b7 10 6 recombinants) against the recombinant SCoV-N protein, and 2100 anti-N scFvs were isolated. Among 14 selected strong SCoV-N protein binders, 2 scFv-phage clones (L9B3a and L9B4b, the clones were renamed as L9N01) gave the identical nucleotide sequence. To our surprise, BLAST search of the derived anti-N scFv sequences against NCBI database indicated that the L9N01 phage Reactivity of individual mice sera (500\u00b7 fold diluted) towards SCoV-N protein was tested against purified recombinant N protein (0.5 lg). Strong immunoreactivity was noted in immunized mice but not in controls, suggesting humoral response of mouse towards SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cell lysate mimicking antibody response to SARS-CoV infection. clone shares a high sequence homology (84%) with an anti-IL-11 scFv (Accession No. AY171038) (Fig. 3) .\n\nIn order to examine the cross-reactivity, L9N01 were tested against recombinant N protein and IL-11 by phage-ELISA. The L9N01 scFv-phage bound strongly both to the recombinant N protein as well as to a recombinant IL-11 (Fig. 4) . However, L9N01 did not react with IL-6 which is structurally and functionally similar to IL-11 (data not shown).\n\nTo evaluate the biological effect of anti-N scFv, IL-11stimulated tyrosine 705 phosphorylation of STAT 3 in rat intestinal epithelial IEC-18 cells was examined. IL-11 stimulated STAT 3 phosphorylation that lasted throughout the 60-min test period. In the presence of L9N01 phage (6 \u00b7 10 10 cfu), IL-11-induced phosphorylation was completely suppressed. By contrast, the presence of other specific anti-N scFvs exerted no inhibitory effect (Fig. 5 ).\n\nInduction of auto-antibodies has been reported in viral infection of human immunodeficiency virus [20, 21] , human-T-lymphotropic virus type-1 [22, 23] , hepatitis C virus [24, 25] , enterovirus [26, 27] , and Epstein-Barr virus [28, 29] . Indeed, the generation of auto-antibodies against a phospholipid protein complex (Lupus anticoagulants) [30] and a glycan moiety of human serum glycoprotein asialo-orosomucoid [31] in SARS-CoV infection has been suggested. Patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome were characterized with a fast and strong anti-N antibody response [6, 32] . The pathophysiological significance and clinical relevance of cross-reacting anti-N antibody with IL-11 are unknown. IL-11 is widely expressed in different tissues including lung, thymus, bone, and central nervous system. Physiologically, IL-11 regulates hematopoiesis and bone metabolism, and inhibits the production of proinflammatory cytokines [16, 17] . In this regard, it is of interest to note that thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia were 5 . Inhibition of IL11-stimulated STAT 3 phosphorylation. Serum-starved IEC-18 were grown in 24-well plates and stimulated with IL-11 (5 nM) in the presence and absence of various anti-N scFv phage clones (9 \u00b7 10 10 cfu) at 37\u00b0C for 60 min in a final volume of 100 ll. Proteins of total cell lysate were separated in a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel. After electro-transfer onto a nitrocellulose paper, the protein blot was then probed with a 1000\u00b7 fold diluted mouse monoclonal anti-phospho STAT 3 (Tyr 705) antibody together with a 10,000\u00b7 diluted mouse monoclonal anti-b-actin antibody. Data shown are representative of three to five separate experiments with similar results. commonly observed in patients during the early phase of SRAS-CoV infection [33] [34] [35] . Furthermore, osteonecrosis has been reported in some convalescent SARS patients [36, 37] . Significant levels of anti-N antibody were generally detected 1-2 weeks after the onset of symptoms [7, 32] , and therefore the inhibitory effect on IL-11 of those cross-reactive anti-N antibody on early SARS symptoms development might play a very limited role. On the other hand, the cross-reactivity of anti-N antibody with IL-11 suggests that the SCoV-N protein shares a similar structural motif with IL-11. The possibility cannot be excluded that the common structural motifs of N protein and IL-11 are important for mediating various biological activities of IL-11, and therefore the presence of N proteins in the early infection cycle may act as a functional antagonist of IL-11. However, SCoV-N protein itself did not stimulate STAT 3 phosphorylation, and the presence of SCoV-N protein also did not modulate IL-11-induced STAT 3 phosphorylation in IEC-18 cells (data not shown). Therefore, it is unlikely that SCoV-N protein and IL-11 share a common structural motif that binds and activates the STAT 3-coupled IL-11 receptor.\n\nThe administration of steroid in SARS patient has been suggested as the cause for osteonecrosis in convalescent SARS patients, however, the onset of osteonecrosis (91-143 days) is shorter than that of patients receiving chronic steroid therapy [37] . Furthermore, the cumulative prednisolone dosage of convalescent SARS children patients who showed radiologic evidence of osteonecrosis was not significantly different from those not showing any signs of osteonecrosis [36] . As shown in the present study that cross-reactive anti-N neutralized IL-11, the long-term significance of cross-reactive anti-N antibody on IL-11-mediated bone metabolism has to be evaluated.\n\nA marked increase in proinflammatory cytokine IL-1b has been observed in children suffering from SARS [38] . Recently, Mizutani et al. [39] have demonstrated that phosphorylation of STAT 3 is suppressed in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells. In the present study, we document the anti-N antibody might cross-react with IL-11. These results suggest a possibility that SARS-CoV infection results in modulating cytokine responses. Hence, a detailed analysis of SARS patients\u00d5 sera on anti-cytokine activities, in particular of those samples that derived from severely ill or deceased patients, might help us to have a better understanding of the pathogenesis of the SARS syndrome."}
