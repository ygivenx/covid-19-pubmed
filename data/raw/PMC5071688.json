{"title": "Chloroquine could be used for the treatment of filoviral infections and other viral infections that emerge or emerged from viruses requiring an acidic pH for infectivity", "body": "Chloroquine is a weak base, commonly used in the treatment of malaria and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 It is readily absorbed when administered by either oral or parenteral routes,15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 becoming highly concentrated in tissues such as the adrenal glands, liver, spleen and kidney15, 16, 17, 18, 23 \u2013 tissues suffering extensive necrosis in fatal filoviral infections.1, 2, 4 In the cells of these and other tissues, CQ becomes concentrated in acidic organelles such as the endosomes, lysosomes and Golgi vesicles,16, 17, 18, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 thereby increasing their pH24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31 and leading to the dysfunction of several enzymes, e.g. those required for the proteolytic processing and the post\u2010translational modification of proteins.10, 24, 25, 27, 31, 32, 33, 34 CQ also inhibits the production of several immunological mediators, the excessive release of which contributes to autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.18, 24 Therefore, these CQ properties should be considered in the treatment for filoviral infections and their associated pathologies.\n\nThe CQ\u2010increased pH of the acidic organelles has been shown to inhibit several viruses \u2013 including influenza A and B, SARS coronavirus, hepatitis A virus and the Borna disease virus \u2013 which all require a low pH for entry.24, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 This suggests that CQ could also inhibit filoviruses' entry into the cytoplasm of susceptible cells and thereby abrogate their infection, since this is dependent on endosomal acidification and the activities of several host endosomal proteases. CQ might also inhibit the assembly and budding of filoviruses \u2013 which partly require the late endosome in their assembly.1, 2\n\n\nAccordingly, the dysfunction of enzymes, e.g. some glycosyltransferases, caused by CQ or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), as a direct result of the increased pH and/or structural changes in the Golgi apparatus, has been shown to inhibit not only the glycosylation of SARS coronavirus,34 but also that of HIV\u20101 gp120, thereby leading to the production of noninfectious virions or virus with decreased infectivity.31, 33, 40, 41 This mechanism has been invoked to explain the decrease in viral load that was observed when patients with HIV\u20101 were orally administered HCQ at 800 mg/day for 8 weeks.31, 42 These results, though obtained with nonrelated viruses, could suggest that CQ, if given at the correct dosage, might inhibit the glycosylation of EboV peplomers, which is more pronounced than that occurring with HIV\u20101.1, 2, 3, 43 Since the GP of filoviruses is the only protein involved in initiating infection,1, 2, 5, 6, 8 and cytotoxicity is dependent on its expression,1, 2, 5 inhibiting its glycosylation could potentially (1) inhibit EboV tropism for a broad variety of host cells and organs; (2) lead to the production of noninfectious or decreased infectivity virus (as seen with HIV\u20101)31, 33; and (3) decrease Ebov pathogenicity. Impaired glycosylation could therefore save time for the adaptive immune response, which normally fails in fatal cases,1, 2, 11 to be established and deal with the infection.\n\nApart from therapeutically exploiting the increased pH and dysfunction of enzymes caused by CQ, the immunomodulatory properties of this drug could also be exploited therapeutically in the treatment of some of filoviral infection\u2010associated pathologies. Several studies have suggested that the multiple organ failure and hypovolemic shock seen in fatal cases are likely a result of both direct infection and destruction of susceptible cells, such as endothelial cells, and the effect of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and other mediators released from infected and activated cells, such as monocytes and macrophages.1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 11, 12, 44\n\n\nOne cytokine strongly implicated in these pathologies is TNF\u2010\u03b1,1, 2, 7, 12, 13 which is able to increase the permeability of endothelial cells, as shown in experiments conducted with the human umbilical vein.1, 2, 7 It is also able \u2013 in humans injected with a recombinant form \u2013 to induce a sustained activation of blood coagulation and also cause tissue injury and shock.45, 46, 47 The role of TNF\u2010\u03b1 in the pathologies and fatalities associated with filoviral infections is further confirmed by the fact that (1) intramuscular administration of anti\u2010TNF\u2010\u03b1 serum, after 4\u20137 days postinfection, is able to reduce the circulating concentration of TNF\u2010\u03b1 and protect 50% of infected rodents from death1, 2; (2) patients who recovered from infection with Zaire EboV (ZEboV) in two recent outbreaks in Gabon had a transient increase in the plasma concentration of TNF\u2010\u03b1 at the onset of infection \u2013 which then decreased during the course of the infection. Conversely, fatal cases display an increased and sustained concentration of TNF\u2010\u03b1.12 In these fatalities, highly increased concentrations of soluble tumour necrosis factor receptors were also detected.12 Taken together, these observations clearly show that a therapeutic agent like CQ, which is able to prevent the activation of macrophages and also inhibit the secretion of TNF\u2010\u03b1 from various cells at clinically relevant concentrations,24, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52 could be of some benefit in the treatment of filoviral infections.\n\nAnother cytokine likely to be implicated in Ebola pathogenesis \u2013 especially the massive apoptosis or lymphopenia associated with fatal cases of EboV infections \u2013 is IFN\u2010\u03b3.11, 12, 13 It has been reported that IFN\u2010\u03b3 is able to increase cellular sensitivity to apoptosis by upregulating the expression of Fas and Fas ligand,53 and in all fatal cases of EboV infection, the expression of IFN\u2010\u03b3, Fas and Fas ligand was shown to be upregulated.11 Another mechanism by which IFN\u2010\u03b3 might \u2013 at least in part \u2013 account for the massive apoptosis detected in Filovirus infections is induction of production by monocytes/macrophages of neopterin and its derivative, 7\u20108\u2010dihydroneopterin.12, 54 It has been reported that neopterin and 7\u20108\u2010dihydroneopterin induce apoptosis in a rat alveolar cell line,54 and that the plasma concentration of neopterin significantly and progressively increases throughout the disease course of all fatal cases of ZEboV infections \u2013 but not in survivors.12 Therefore, the production of neopterin and 7\u20108\u2010dihydroneopterin upon IFN\u2010\u03b3 stimulation might also contribute to the massive apoptosis seen in fatal cases of EboV infections.11, 12, 13\n\n\nThus, since the massive apoptosis seen in all fatal cases of EboV\u2010infected patients is associated with the production of IFN\u2010\u03b3, neopterin and 7\u20108\u2010dihydroneopterin, and TNF\u2010\u03b1,11, 12, 13 a therapeutic agent like CQ, having been shown, at clinically relevant concentrations, to inhibit the production of IFN\u2010\u03b3, TNF\u2010\u03b1 and neopterin from various cells,24, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52 could be of great benefit in the treatment of patients infected with the present ZEboV or other filoviruses.\n\nAlthough the above mechanisms of the action of CQ and the various in vitro studies suggest that CQ may exert some benefit in infections from viruses that require an acidic pH for infectivity and/or are heavily glycosylated and evoke a detrimental immune activation, several clinical trials that attempted to use CQ or HCQ in the prevention or treatment of several viral infections \u2013 including influenza A and B, HIV\u20101 and dengue viral infections \u2013 have reported that CQ or HCQ either had undetectable/moderate clinical efficacy or were actually detrimental (Table 1).42, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66\n\n\nIt is possible to hypothesize that these mixed or disappointing results may be attributable to not knowing \u2013 and thus not achieving \u2013 the therapeutic steady state plasma or whole blood CQ concentration necessary for exerting its therapeutic effects (refer to the succeeding texts). In order for CQ to be used for the treatment of infections from viruses that require an acidic pH for infectivity and/or are heavily glycosylated and depend on their envelop glycoprotein for infectivity, the therapeutic steady state plasma or whole blood concentration must be achieved and sustained until the patient's viraemia becomes undetectable. In the succeeding texts, I summarize some of the evidence that can be used to determine the necessary therapeutic, steady state plasma or whole blood CQ concentration.\n\nFirstly, several in vitro studies have shown that the optimal uptake of CQ in several cell types isolated from different animals is in the range of 10\u201320 \u03bcM, with concentrations >~30 \u03bcM, causing less uptake.26, 30\n\n\nSecondly, the whole blood CQ EC50 of 17.7 \u03bcM/L is considered to be an in vivo threshold of CQ toxicity since it is a level associated with significant cardiovascular effects in patients with CQ poisoning,67 whilst patients having concentrations of 16 \u03bcM/L were shown to have no significant cardiovascular events.67\n\n\nThirdly, out of all the clinical trials summarized in Table 1, only the trial that administered the highest HCQ dose, for a duration sufficient to attain a steady state (0.08 to 2.98 \u03bcM/L, mean = 0.94 \u03bcM/L), reported a moderate improvement in several of the patients.42 Of all the patients, only the one with the highest HCQ level (2.98 \u03bcM/L) (which is approximately equivalent to the in vitro CQ EC50 of ~3 \u03bcM shown to inhibit HIV\u20101 replication33) had the best response to HCQ. This patient's absolute CD4+ T\u2010cells increased from 200 to 400 cells/mm3, the plasma levels of HIV\u20101 RNA decreased from 225 to 135 cpm, the percentage of CD4+ T\u2010cells increased from 11% to 34%, and there was also a significant improvement in mitogen responses.42 Although HIV does not depend on the acidic organelles for infectivity and is less glycosylated in comparison to EboV,1, 2, 3, 43 HCQ, at this steady state concentration, is nevertheless able to inhibit HIV replication by affecting gp120 glycosylation.31, 33, 42\n\n\nFourthly, the steady state CQ/HCQ concentrations of 1 \u00b5g/mL (~3.125 \u03bcM/L) and ~16 \u03bcM/L detected in plasma and whole blood respectively, have been shown both in vivo and in vitro to inhibit viral replication and the overproduction of some immunological mediators associated with the pathologies of many viral infections and some autoimmune diseases.22, 48, 64, 68, 69, 70\n\n\nI conclude that (1) a 16 \u03bcM/L transient or steady state whole blood concentration of CQ most likely has no significant cardiovascular events22, 42, 67, 68, 69; (2) ~16 \u03bcM/L steady state whole blood concentration of CQ/HCQ is able to inhibit viral replication, glycosylation and the over production of some immunological mediators associated with some viral infections22, 33, 34, 35, 38, 39, 42, 64, 67, 68, 69, 70; (3) the optimal uptake of CQ in humans is likely to lie within the range of 10\u201320 \u03bcM/L. Therefore, such a steady state CQ concentration could be safe and sufficient to raise and maintain the acidic organelles' pH to a level approximately neutral, thereby inhibiting viral replication by mechanisms such as inhibition of endosomal proteases, inhibition of the fusion of viral membrane with host cells plasma membranes and inhibition of viral glycosylation.\n\nIn order to achieve the recommended therapeutic steady state plasma or whole blood CQ concentrations, the use of slow, continuous and constant IV infusion could be recommendable, since (1) it could be more efficient in achieving the stated therapeutic concentration and (2) it is more controlled, given the low cardiovascular safety margin of CQ.18, 21\n\n\nHaving recommended the use of constant IV infusion, suggesting a precise dose and an infusion rate for filoviral infection treatment (as in the treatment of malaria), though seemingly reasonably, is, however, impossible at this stage. This is primarily because of the interindividual differences in the pharmacokinetics of CQ absorption.69, 71\n\n\nI conclude that 1 \u00b5g/mL (~3.125 \u03bcM/L) or 16 \u03bcM/L steady state CQ concentration in plasma or whole blood respectively, could be used for the treatment of filoviral and other infections by viruses requiring an acidic pH for infectivity, and that these concentrations need to be sustained until the patients' viraemia becomes undetectable. These stated concentrations, however, do not rule out the efficacy of other, higher, steady state concentrations \u2013 though such concentrations might be accompanied by severe adverse effects or toxicities. Other subsequent research has supported the conclusion in the preceding texts by confirming that a derivative of CQ has some protective effect against Ebola infection in humans.72\n\n\nThe author declares no conflict of interest."}
