{"title": "Fatal pneumonia and viremia due to human parainfluenza virus type 1 in a patient with adult T-cell leukemiaelymphoma treated with mogamulizumab", "body": "Adult T-cell leukemiaelymphoma (ATL) is a kind of peripheral Tcell lymphoma caused by human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) [1] . It is classified into four categories (acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering types) depending on clinical features [2] . ATL is often resistant to chemotherapies, thus resulting in poor prognosis [3] . Since ATL per se induces severe impairment of cellular immunity, ATL patients are susceptible to opportunistic infections by cytomegalovirus (CMV), candida, Pneumocystis jirovecci, and Strongyloides stercoralis [4] . Mogamulizumab is a promising, brand-new therapeutic option for ATL. This agent binds CeC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) protein abundantly expressed in membrane surface of ATL cells, thereby activating natural killer cells in a manner of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity [5] . In patients treated with mogamulizumab, median progression-free survival and overall survival intervals were 5.2 and 13.7 months, respectively [5] . On the other hand, its profile of robust cytotoxicity would be problematic in some cases. In fact, it has been suggested that mogamulizumab increases the risk of reactivation of CMV and hepatitis B virus [6, 7] .\n\nCommunity respiratory viruses (CRVs) such as human rhinovirus and parainfluenza virus cause a common cold in healthy subjects. However, these viruses often cause severe pneumonia in patients with leukemia and those undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) mainly through decreased T cell responses [8e10].\n\nHere we report a case of fatal pneumonia and viremia due to human parainfluenza virus type 1 (HPIV-1) in a 65-year-old male patient with adult T-cell leukemiaelymphoma (ATL) treated with mogamulizumab.\n\nA 65-years-old male patient was diagnosed as having an acute type of ATL after eleven years of chronic phase, because the number of white blood cells (WBC) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the peripheral blood were markedly increased to 43,700/mL and 700 IU/ L, respectively. Therefore, combined regimens with VCAP (vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone), AMP (doxorubicin, ranimustine, and prednisone), and VECP (vindesine, etoposide, carboplatin, and prednisone) were started as an induction chemotherapy. Soon after the third course of VCAPeAMPeVECP therapies were finished, the number of circulating lymphocytes and ATL cells, LDH and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) were unfortunately increased rapidly, suggesting that his status was turned to refractory phase.\n\nWe therefore introduced mogamulizumab at the dosage of 1 mg/kg per week as the salvage therapy based on the finding that positive ratio of the CCR4 antigen in ATL cells was 97%. Before the treatment, the number of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and ATL cells in the peripheral blood was 2849/mL, 10,780/mL, and 847/mL, respectively. On day 2 after induction of mogamulizumab, ATL cells disappeared in the peripheral blood, and the number of lymphocytes was rapidly decreased to 460/mL, accompanied by the prolongation of severe lymphopenia (grade 3e4) (Fig. 1 ). Despite prophylactic medication had been administered with levofloxacin (LVFX), itraconazole (ITCZ), sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (ST) and acyclovir (ACV), he suffered from infectious complications including CMV antigenemia, gram-negative bacterial sepsis, and aspergillosis during the clinical course. Although these infections were well controlled by the broad spectrum antimicrobial treatment, multiple patchy ground-glass opacities in bilateral lungs, an atypical pattern of bacterial pneumonia, were appeared and gradually worsened. Due to acute respiratory failure, he died on day 48 (Figs. 1 and 2). Since chest CT showed typical patterns of viral pneumonia (Fig. 2) , the peripheral blood was collected premortally and examined with multiplex PCR kit (Seeplex RV15 OneStep ACE Detection, Seegene, South Korea), which can screen most CRVs including influenza virus A/B, human adenovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus 1/2/3, rhinovirus A/B/C, respiratory syncytial (RS) virus A/B, bocavirus 1/2/3/4, metapneumovirus, and enterovirus [11] . Consequently, RNA of HPIV-1 was detected in the blood and we diagnosed viremia due to HPIV-1.\n\nIn the autopsied lungs, cytoplasmic inclusion bodies and multinucleated syncytial giant cells were abundantly observed (Fig. 3) . These findings are commonly observed in viral pneumonia and especially, the former finding strongly suggests RNA viral infection. Also, hyaline membrane formation reflecting diffuse alveolar damage was observed in the lung (Fig. 3) . On the other hand, neutrophilic infiltration and microorganisms including bacteria and fungi were not observed. Also, CCR4 antigen-positive ATL cells were not detected at all in the lung and a variety of tissues, indicating that his ATL status was complete remission. Taken together, we finally diagnosed that the cause of death was severe pneumonia due to HPIV-1 infection. \n\nWe herein reported a case of fatal pneumonia and viremia due to HPIV-1 in a patient with ATL treated with mogamulizumab. There is only one report showing human parainfluenza virus type 2 (HPIV-2) viremia in a patient with acute myocarditis [12] . To our knowledge, this case is the first report documenting viremia due to HPIV-1.\n\nCRVs are widely known as causative pathogens of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in healthy subjects. However, CRVs have also been recognized to cause lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) with high mortality rate in patients with leukemia or recipients of HSCT [8,9,13e16] . LRTI due to HPIV occurred in 13%e43% in patients with leukemia and HSCT recipients, and its mortality rate was 12e50% [15] . The most important risk factor for progression to LRTI is lymphopenia. Although the thresholds vary according to studies, lymphocyte count less than 200/mL is accepted as the guideline [8, 13] . In the present case, prolongation of severe lymphopenia less than 200/mL was considered as the possible main cause to develop fatal pneumonia and viremia due to HPIV-1.\n\nChest CT images may help to differentiate between bacterial and viral pneumonia. Generally, interstitial infiltrates including multifocal distribution of ground-glass opacities suggest viral pneumonia [17e19]. Regarding HPIV pneumonia, a recent study showed that tree-in-bud opacities reflecting bronchiolitis were the most common finding (67%) followed by bronchial wall thickening (38%) and ground-glass opacities (38%) [20] . Although the typical tree-inbud opacities were not observed in the present case, centrilobular nodules suggesting bronchiolitis were observed on day 32, and the findings were worsened to diffuse patchy ground-glass opacities over the clinical course (Fig. 2) . Thus, CT images observed in this patient were consistent with the previous report of HPIV pneumonia.\n\nIdeally, direct detection of virus from the lung is warranted to diagnose viral pneumonia. Both immunostaining with anti-HPIV-1 antibodies and detection of HPIV-1 in the extraction liquid from lung tissue were attempted. However, it was technically difficult to detect HPIV-1 in the lung because RNA is generally unstable and long-term fixation with formalin and paraffin should be cruel condition for RNA virus including HPIV-1. We finally diagnosed HPIV-1 pneumonia based on a line of evidence as listed below; 1) HPIV-1 was detected in the blood, 2) CT images were consistent with viral pneumonia, and 3) pathological findings suggested RNA viral infection in the lung.\n\nUndoubtedly, mogamulizumab is a promising agent for the treatment of refractory ATL. However, its robust cytotoxicity may provoke life-threatening opportunistic infections as observed in the present case. Although some reports showed ribavirin therapy with or without intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was effective for the treatment of HPIV infection [9] , there is no established antiviral therapy for the treatment of HPIV infection. In this context, standard precaution is the most effective countermeasure to prevent the infection and spread of HPIV [8, 9] .\n\nIn conclusion, we reported a case of fatal pneumonia and viremia due to HPIV-1 in a patient with ATL treated with mogamulizumab. The current case suggested that prolonged severe lymphopenia induced by mogamulizumab was most likely to let the patient susceptible to HPIV-1 infection."}
