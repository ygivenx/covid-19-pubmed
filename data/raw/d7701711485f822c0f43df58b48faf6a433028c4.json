{"title": "Transmission potential of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) onboard the Diamond Princess Cruises Ship, 2020", "body": "While the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) spread rapidly throughout China for several weeks since December 2019, the virus had not taken off outside China in part due to the unprecedented social distancing measures that the Chinese government put in place.\n\nOne exception is the outbreak of COVID-19 that developed aboard the Diamond Princess Ship which was detected in early February when one of its passengers, a traveler from Hong Kong, tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The number of cases in the Diamond Princess Ship quickly jumped to 454 confirmed cases by February 18, 2020. In contrast, the total number of cases in Singapore, one of the countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cases after China, was only 77 at the time [1] .\n\nAccumulating evidence indicates that the novel coronavirus can spread widely in confined settings including hospitals [2] , cruise ships [3], prisons, and churches [4] [5] . In Wuhan City, China, outbreaks inside health care settings led to the infection of hundreds of health professionals [2] . In Tokyo, Japan, most of the reported infections have been linked to a party inside a traditional wooden ship, called Yakatabune [6] while most of the infections in Korea have affected members of one church and one hospital.\n\n.

When outbreaks occur in confined settings, it is useful to investigate how the effective reproduction number changes as a result of interventions strategies such as the quarantine that the Japanese government imposed on travelers and crew members aboard the Diamond Princess Ship.\n\nIn this study we sought to characterize the temporal variation in the transmission potential of the COVID-19 outbreak aboard the Princess Cruises Ship using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data by dates of symptoms onset describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members.\n\nIn Yokohama, Japan, an outbreak of COVID-19 has been unfolding on board the Princess Cruise Ship, which has been under quarantine orders since February 5, 2020, after a former passenger of the Diamond Princess Ship tested positive for the virus after disembarking in Hong Kong [3,7]. As of February 22, 2020, two days after the scheduled two-week quarantine came to an end, a total of 621 symptomatic and .

Specifically, let f s denote the probability mass function of the serial interval of COVID-19, where the serial interval is defined as the time from illness onset in the primary case to time of illness onset in the secondary case. Then f s , of length s days, is given by\n\nFor s>0, F(s) represents the cumulative distribution function of the gamma distribution.\n\nWe characterized the expected number of new incident cases E[c i,t ] in type i at symptom onset week t as follows,\n\nwhere r ij denotes the average number of cases of type i infected by a single individual of type j. Here we assume that the incidence, c i,t , follows a Poisson sampling process with\n\nThe reproduction matrix for each type is given by .

Using this matrix, we derive the instantaneous time-dependent effective reproduction number, R t , for the entire transmission dynamics from the largest eigenvalue of the NGM. Under the assumption that the per-contact infection probability and the generation interval are consistent over time regardless of the type of infection, the NGM quantifies the within type and inter-type patterns of transmission [9] . The sum of the value in column j is the reproduction number for a specific type j.\n\nSerial interval estimates of COVID-19 were derived from previous studies of COVID-19, indicating that it follows a gamma distribution with the mean and SD at 7.5 and 3.4 days, respectively, based on ref.

Median R t are 5.8 (95%CrI: 0.6-11.0), 6.1 (95%CrI: 0.5, 11.8), 0.9 (95%CrI: 0.3, 1.5) for overall and by type (passenger, crew).\n\nExamining inter-type and within-type transmission, R t estimates greatly vary across transmission types: 5.6 (95%CrI: 0.3, 10.9) for passenger to passenger, 0.6 (95%CrI: 0.1, 1.1) for passenger to crew, 0.5 (95%CrI: 0.2, 0.8) for crew to passenger, 0.5 (95%CrI: 0.3, 0.8) for crew to crew.

Passenger and crew also have total (within-type and inter-type) R t values largely below the epidemic threshold, with only small percentages at 0% and 9% above the epidemic threshold, respectively (Table   3 ).\n\nThis is the first study to assess the transmission potential of the COVID-19 outbreak that unfolded aboard the Diamond Princess Ship, January-February 2020. The overall mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11, which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in China and Singapore in the range 1.1-7 [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . However, following the implementation of the quarantine period, the overall R t decreased substantially compared to values estimated during the early stage, but it exhibited fluctuations around the epidemic threshold, which likely prolonged the outbreak.\n\n.

As for the crude asymptomatic ratios by age groups, they show significant differences across age groups. However, these crude ratios are severely influenced by the timing of specimen collection relative to the infection time [19] . Hence, these ratios could be better ascertained if additional data with the timing of specimen collection becomes available.\n\n.
