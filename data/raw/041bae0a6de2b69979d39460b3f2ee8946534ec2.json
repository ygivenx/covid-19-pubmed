{"title": "Estimation of the final size of the second phase of the coronavirus COVID 19 epidemic by the logistic model", "body": "however, use approximate solution and thus obtain four-parameter problem which can be very sensitive to initial guess). Yet, the logistics model has its drawbacks as the epidemic approaches its final stage: the actual number of cases may be slightly larger than that predicted by the logistics model. If the actual number of cases begins to exceed the predicted end-state systematically, then a second phase of the epidemic is likely to occur, and the model will no longer be applicable.\n\nIn mathematical epidemiology, when one uses a phenomenological approach, the epidemic dynamics can be described by the following variant of logistic growth model [2] [3] [4] [5] \n\nwhere C is an accumulated number of cases, 0 r \uf03e infection rate, and 0 K \uf03e is the final epidemic size.

In particular, the calculated limit is useless if n K C \uf03c , i.e., it is below the current data.\n\nThe logistic model (2) contains three parameters: K, r, and A, which should be determined by regression analysis. Because the model is nonlinear, some care should be taken for initial guess. First of all, in the early stage, the logistic curve follows an exponential growth curve (3) , so the estimation of K is practically impossible. With enough data, the initial guess can be obtain in the following way. Expressing t from (2) and use three equidistant data point yield the following system of three equations:\n\nThis system has a solution [7] \uf028 \uf029\n\nThe solution is acceptable when all the unknowns are positive.\n\nFormulas (10),(11),(12) are used to calculate the initial approximation in the fitVirus program. For practical calculation, we take the first, the middle, and the last data point. If this calculation fails, we consider regression analysis as questionable. Final .

It seems that the epidemic in China is in the ending stage (Fig 3, Fig 4) .\n\nThe short-term forecasting is given in Table 3 where we see that the discrepancy of actual and forecasted number of cases is within 2%. However, actual and predicted daily new cases are scattered and vary between 13% to 300%. On 7 Mar 2020, the actual number of cases was 80695, and the daily number of cases was 44. Prediction in Table 3 is cumulative 80588 cases and 39 daily cases. The errors are 0.1% and 11%, respectively. .

The epidemic in South Korea appears to be in the steady-state transition phase. These figures were already predicted on 4. Mar 2020 (Table 5) , i.e., the prediction was approximately 7500\n\nto 8500 cases and that the peak will be around 2 Mar.\n\nOn 7 Mar 2020, the actual number of cases was 7134, and the daily number of cases was 367.

Based on the data from 11. Mar 2020, a very rough estimate indicates that the number of cases will be about 90000 (Fig 7) ; data from 13. Mar 2020 rise this number to 380 000.\n\nHowever, it is an early-stage epidemic, so these estimates are very questionable and will be changed with new data.

For South Korea, a prediction is about 8000 cases. For the rest of the World, the forecasts are still very unreliable in is now approximately 380 000 cases.\n\nWe emphasize that the logistics model is a phenomenological, data-driven model. Thus, its forecasts are as reliable as useful are data and as good as the model can capture the dynamics of the epidemic. As daily epidemic size forecasts begin to converge, it can be said that the outbreak is under control. However, any systematic deviation from the forecast curve may indicate that the epidemic is escaping control. An example is China.\n\nBy 25. Feb., the data follows a logistic curve and then begins to deviate from it. We now know that this was the beginning of the second stage of the epidemic, which is now spreading around the World. A similar linear trend can now be observed for South Korea ( Fig 5) ; we hope this does not mark the beginning of the second stage of the epidemic in this country."}
