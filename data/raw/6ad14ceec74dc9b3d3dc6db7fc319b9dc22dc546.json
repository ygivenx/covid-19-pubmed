K0 and W0 represent KO 208 and WT animals that were not inoculated with PEDV and were reared by their dams on the farm.\n\nKO and WT are knockout treated and wild-type treated animals, respectively. (Table 4) . Furthermore, all piglets sustained their activity until 214 24 hpi (Table 4 ). In the WT group, the first death occurred at 40 hpi ( Fig 4B) ; two piglets were 215 lost at 48 hpi, 4 piglets died at 56 hpi, and the remaining two piglets were alive at the end of the 216 trial. In the CMAH KO group, the first animal was lost at 44 hpi, and 3, 3, 1 and 1 piglets died at 217 52, 56, 64 and 68 hpi, respectively (Fig 4B) . There was no significant difference in the decrease in and WT) showed sustained activity and viability at least until 56 hpi, with the exception of one 232 CMAH KO piglet that died prior to the end of the trial (Table 5) .
