{"title": "Characterization of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like-protein isopeptidase activities", "body": "UBLs, can be deconjugated by proteases called ubiquitin or UBL isopeptidases. The term isopeptidase herein will refer to proteases that specifically cleave ubiquitin or UBLs after the terminal carboxyl group of ubiquitin (Gly76) or UBL (Amerik and Hochstrasser 2004) . Deubiquitylases (DUBs), isopeptidases that cleave at the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin, have been divided into five distinct groups, the largest being the ubiquitin-specific proteases (USP/UBP) (Amerik and Hochstrasser 2004; Nijman et al. 2005) .\n\nThe approval of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (velcade) for multiple myeloma validated the ubiquitin proteasome pathway for cancer treatment (Bross et al. 2004 ). Unfortunately, toxicities associated with proteasome inhibition limit the clinical application of bortezomib and other proteasome inhibitors. In contrast, therapeutic strategies that target specific aspects of the ubiquitinproteasome pathway are predicted to be better tolerated. Genomics has identified at least 530 human genes that putatively encode enzymes involved in the conjugation and deconjugation of ubiquitin; of these, at least 79 are thought to encode functional DUBs, some of which have multiple isoforms (Wong et al. 2003; Nijman et al. 2005) . Considerable progress has been made in the study of ubiquitin conjugation; however, the study of DUBs is still in its nascent stages. The importance of aberrant DUB activity in carcinogenesis has been recently reviewed (Nicholson et al. 2007 ).\n\nIn addition to the DUBs, multiple families of UBLspecific isopeptidases exist, such as SENP1 and SENP2, which cleave SUMO, and DEN1 (SENP8), which cleaves NEDD8 (Gan-Erdene et al. 2003; Cheng et al. 2006 ). UBP43, the mouse homolog of the human isopeptidase USP18, was originally reported to be a deISGylase with no DUB activity, and UBP43 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were characterized by premature death, brain cell injury, and elevated levels of ISG15 conjugates in the brain Ritchie et al. 2002) . However, the relevance of the deISGylase activity of UBP43 was questioned following the observation that the phenotype of UBP43 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice was not rescued by the additional knockout of ISG15 (Knobeloch et al. 2005) . The coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome papain-like protease (SARS-CoV PLpro) was reported to be a DUB with some deISGylase activity (Harcourt et al. 2004 ; Barretto et al. 2005; Lindner et al. 2005) . Using the fluorogenic reporters Ub-AMC (Ub-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin) and ISG15-AMC, it was very recently reported that SARS Co-V PLpro functioned preferentially as a deISGylase (Lindner et al. 2007 ). Another report demonstrated that a second coronavirus, NL63, encoded an isopeptidase, papain-like protease 2 (PLP2), with DUB activity (Chen et al. 2007 ). Interestingly, the presence or absence of deISGylating activity was not reported (Chen et al. 2007 ). The medical relevance of NL63 is illustrated by studies demonstrating that NL63 is associated with both upper and lower respiratory tract infections (Fouchier et al. 2004; van der Hoek et al. 2004 van der Hoek et al. , 2005 .\n\nThe first DUBs were cloned over a decade ago (Wilkinson et al. 1989; Tobias and Varshavsky 1991) , but to date the only commercially available options of monitoring isopeptidase activity in a high-throughput screening (HTS) manner are the UBL-AMC conjugates or the Lanthascreen DUB substrate (Dang et al. 1998; Gan-Erdene et al. 2003; Lindner et al. 2005; Horton et al. 2007) . Given the potential drawbacks associated with other assays for measuring isopeptidase activity, we sought to develop a superior reporter-based assay. Previously, it was reported that a number of DUBs are able to cleave Ub conjugates linked by an eor a-peptide linkage with similar efficiency (Larsen et al. 1998; Lin et al. 2001) . Furthermore, selected enzymes require a free amino terminus for catalytic activity. Initially, we described a prototype of an isopeptidase assay in a study of the activity of the catalytic core of the yeast SUMO protease, ULP1 (Arnold et al. 2006) . Data presented herein describe the generation of a reporter system consisting of Ub or UBL fused to the amino terminus of an alternative reporter, phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ), by an a-peptide bond. This assay is able to determine the contrasting substrate specificities of the coronavirus proteases PLpro and PLP2 and characterize a novel modulator of isopeptidase activity, demonstrating its broad utility.\n\nThe Ub-PLA 2 assay is based on the fact that PLA 2 requires a free amino terminus to be catalytically active. PLA 2 cleaves the 2-acyl linkage of 3-sn-phosphoglycerides in a Ca 2+ -dependent reaction and requires a free amino terminus for catalytic activity ( Fig. 1 ; Dijkstra et al. 1981 ). Initially, a recombinant reporter construct consisting of Ub fused to the amino terminus of mouse soluble PLA 2 group X was expressed and purified. In addition, the core catalytic domain of the isopeptidase USP2a/2b (hereafter referred to as USP2) was overexpressed as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli.\n\nProof of concept for the coupled assay was provided by the observation that USP2 was able to cleave Ub-PLA 2 completely following a 30-min incubation at room temperature ( Fig. 2A,B) . Furthermore, the cleavage of Ub-PLA 2 was dose dependent as detected by the liberation of the fluorophore 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD) from 2-(6-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)hexanoyl-1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (NBD C 6 -HPC) ( Fig. 2C; Supplemental Fig. S1 ). The initial lag in the cleavage of the PLA 2 substrate NBD C 6 -HPC is partially due to the coupled nature of the USP2, Ub-PLA 2 assay. To determine if the fluorescent readout of the assay accurately reflected USP2 activity, the fluorescence intensity was fitted to a fourth-order polynomial equation (Fig.  2D ). When the x 2 factor was plotted against USP2 concentration, a very strong linear relationship was revealed, confirming the dose dependency of the assay (see Discussion). An additional DUB, USP7, was expressed and purified from Sf9 insect cells, and a similar linear relation-ship was observed when 0-160 nM USP7 was incubated with 30 nM Ub-PLA 2 and 20 mM NBD C 6 -HPC (Supplemental Fig. S2 ). Thus, the DUB, Ub-PLA 2 assay can be used to monitor dose-dependent DUB activity.\n\nThe UBL-PLA 2 assay can be applied to a spectrum of isopeptidases\n\nTo gauge the utility of the assay and expand on our observation that DUBs effectively and specifically cleave Ub from PLA 2 , we tested the ability of other isopeptidases to cleave alternative UBL domains from PLA 2 . Recombinant fusion proteins of SUMO3-PLA 2 , ISG15-PLA 2 , and NEDD8-PLA 2 were expressed and purified from E. coli. Additional isopeptidases were expressed and purified from bacteria and insect cells.\n\nWe examined the relative isopeptidase activities of 13 isopeptidases against four UBL-PLA 2 reporter constructs ( Table 1) . As expected, USP2, USP5, USP7, USP8, and USP15 were primarily deubiquitinating enzymes. Consistent with published reports, USP5 cleavage of Ub-PLA 2 was significantly enhanced by incubating in the presence of 25-100 nM mono Ub (Supplemental Fig. S3 ; Dang et al. 1998; Reyes-Turcu et al. 2006) . Similarly, the mammalian and yeast deSUMOylases SENP2 core and ULP1 core were confirmed to be deSUMOylases, and Figure 1 . Ub-PLA 2 , a novel isopeptidase reporter construct. Specific cleavage by the isopeptidase at the carboxy-terminal glycine of the Ub releases catalytically active PLA 2 , which is then able to turn over its substrate, liberating a fluorescent product. the deNEDDylating enzyme DEN1 to be a deNEDDylase. SARS-CoV PLpro core and UBP43 were both preferentially deISGylases. As reported previously, PLpro also had some DUB activity; however, when equimolar amounts of Ub-PLA 2 and ISG15-PLA 2 were tested concurrently, PLpro generated a much stronger signal with the ISG15-PLA 2 than with the Ub-PLA 2 reporter (Barretto et al. 2005; Lindner et al. 2005 Lindner et al. , 2007 . Interestingly, the selectivity data suggested that 20 nM NL63 PLP2 was able to cleave 30 nM Ub-PLA 2 or 30 nM ISG15-PLA 2 with similar efficiency (Table 1) . We were unable to determine Km values of PLP2 for Ub and ISG15-PLA 2 due to a lack of saturable kinetics (data not shown). However, when compared at a lower concentration (1 nM) with 30 nM of UBL-PLA 2 , a twofold higher signal was observed when PLP2 was incubated with Ub-PLA 2 relative to ISG15-PLA 2 (Fig. 3 ). In contrast, the fluorescent readout for 1 nM PLpro + ISG15-PLA 2 was 3.8-fold greater relative to Ub-PLA 2 (Fig. 3 ). As expected, the relative fluorescence unit (RFU) value was enhanced 17-fold for USP2 and Ub-PLA 2 (vs. ISG15-PLA 2 ).\n\nIn contrast to the other DUBs, 20 nM UCH-L3 was unable to cleave Ub-PLA 2 or any of the other UBL-PLA 2 reporter constructs. The UCH-L3 enzyme was highly active as demonstrated by its ability to cleave the alternative reporter, Ub-AMC (Supplemental Fig. S4 ). Our data are consistent with the observation that ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases such as UCH-L3 preferentially cleave Ub from small adducts (exemplified by Ub-AMC) (Larsen et al. 1998 ). In addition, 20 nM JOSD2, a member of the Machado-Joseph disease domain subfamily of DUBs, was unable to cleave 30 nM of any of the UBL-PLA 2 reporter fusion proteins as detected by PLA 2 activity. However, higher concentrations of JOSD2 cleaved Ub-PLA 2 (Supplemental Fig. S5A ). Comparable results were seen with Ub-AMC, suggesting that JOSD2 is a relatively weak DUB or exhibits substrate specificity (Supplemental Fig. S5B ). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the UBL-PLA 2 assay format has utility as a tool to dissect the specificities of purified isopeptidases.\n\nThe Ub-PLA 2 reporter compares favorably with other reporter systems\n\nWe wished to determine the relative activity of the UBL-PLA 2 system in comparison to other isopeptidase reporter assays. When equimolar concentrations of Ub-PLA 2 and Ub-AMC were directly compared, low (12.5-50 nM) concentrations of Ub-PLA 2 were found to produce significantly higher signal-to-background (S/B) ratios than the same concentrations of Ub-AMC (Supplemental Fig.  S6 ). One application of isopeptidase reporters is the discovery and characterization of novel isopeptidase inhibitors. Prior to screening for inhibitors, we determined the assay robustness and reproducibility in a HTS format, designated by the Z9 value (Zhang et al. 1999) . The USP2, Ub-PLA 2 assay exceeded the Z9 value required for a usable HTS assay (0.5) with a Z9 value of 0.72 6 0.04 (Supplemental Table 1 ; Supplemental Fig.  S7 ). To test whether the Ub-PLA 2 reporter system was capable of identifying an inhibitor of USP2, the EC 50 value of the well-characterized DUB inhibitor, ubiquitin aldehyde (Ub-ald), against USP2 was determined using 27.2 nM Ub-PLA 2 /20 mM NBD C 6 -HPC or 316 nM Ub-AMC (Fig. 4) . Comparable EC 50 values were obtained for Ub-ald mediated inhibition of USP2 as measured by Ub-PLA 2 /NBD C 6 -HPC (363 6 50 nM) or Ub-AMC (473 6 103 nM). The Lanthascreen DUB substrate represents an alternative reporter system for measuring DUB activity. Direct comparison revealed that for the USPs tested, the USP2 core 100 6 0.0 1.4 6 0.3 1.5 6 0.1 0.7 6 0.5 USP5 24 6 6.5 0.9 6 0.8 1.9 6 0.4 9.9 6 0.2 USP7 124 6 23 5.8 6 1.4 1.0 6 0.2 6.5 6 5.2 USP8 core 113 6 3.5 0.8 6 0.1 6.8 6 0.4 0.9 6 0.6 USP15 104 6 19 1.3 6 0.9 0.9 6 0.1 11 6 0.9 UCH-L3 4.1 6 1.1 0.7 6 0.6 0.6 6 0.2 9.1 6 0.1 JOSD2 3.7 6 0.3 0.2 6 0.0 0.6 6 0.1 8.5 6 3.0 SENP2 core 3.2 6 0.4 100 6 0.0 0.7 6 0.1 5.6 6 4.6 ULP1 core 3.3 6 0.8 84 6 13 0.7 6 0.1 10 6 0.8 PLpro core 7.2 6 4.2 0.7 6 0.6 100 6 0.0 9.9 6 0.5 PLP2 103 6 8.4 1.2 6 0.2 92 6 1.9 4.9 6 1.2 UBP43 2.7 6 2.1 1.3 6 0.2 42 6 5.5 1.1 6 0.2 DEN1 0.9 6 1.9 0.7 6 0.5 0.3 6 0.3 100 6 0.0\n\nIsopeptidase activities were determined from three to 12 independent experiments and normalized to controls (Ub, USP2 core; SUMO3, SENP2 core; ISG15, PLpro; and NEDD8, Den1). Mean 6 SD presented. Ub-PLA 2 assay was significantly more sensitive (Supplemental Fig. S8 ). Additional applications of the UBL-PLA 2 assay platform include measuring the isopeptidase activity of crude cell lysates and monitoring partial fractionation schemes from HeLa cells or Sf9 cells (Supplemental Fig. S9A,B) . The observed isopeptidase activities were inhibited by nonspecific sulfhydryl alkylating agent N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM), confirming that the assay measured cysteine protease activity (Supplemental Fig. S9C ) (data not shown). These data confirm that UBL-PLA 2 is a sensitive reporter system that has utility to measure activity of crude cell lysates in addition to purified proteins.\n\nAleo and colleagues reported that NSC 632839 (F6) inhibited ubiquitin isopeptidases as illustrated by its ability to inhibit z-LRGG-AMC cleavage by crude lysates in the mid-micromolar range (Aleo et al. 2006) . To further characterize NSC 632839 against purified enzymes, we determined its inhibitory potential against purified USP2, USP7, and SENP2 and demonstrated that NSC 632839 was not only a DUB inhibitor, but also a deSUMOylase inhibitor (Fig. 5A-C) . Specifically, NSC 632839 inhibited USP2, USP7, and SENP2 with EC 50 values of 45 6 4 mM, 37 6 1 mM, and 9.8 6 1.8 mM, respectively. Importantly, NSC 632839 did not inhibit the reporter enzyme PLA 2 over the concentration range tested (1.2-150 mM), indicating that the reported inhibition was selective for isopeptidases (Fig. 5D ). As expected, NEM inhibited USP2, USP7, and SENP2 with EC 50 values of 1.9 6 0.2 mM, 1.4 6 0.07 mM, and 1.3 6 0.2 mM, respectively ( Fig. 5A-C) . NEM does not inhibit PLA 2 over the concentration range tested (0.2-25 mM) (data not shown). Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) inhibited the Ca 2+ -dependent PLA 2 enzyme (in the presence of 2 mM CaCl 2 ) with an EC 50 value of 2.5 6 0.006 mM (Fig. 5D ). \n\nThe generation of the UBL-PLA 2 reporter system was based on previously reported observations that a number of DUBs are able to cleave Ub conjugates linked by an eor a-peptide linkage with similar efficiency (Larsen et al. 1998; Lin et al. 2001 ). We took advantage of the observation that mature PLA 2 requires a free amino terminus for catalytic activity by creating a fusion protein of an UBL linked to PLA 2 by an a-peptide bond ( Fig. 1 ; Dijkstra et al. 1981) . The data show that the isopeptidase assay configured in this format has a very broad utility and scope, in terms of both ubiquitin family members and efficacy in diverse systems, including cell lysates and subsequent fractionations. Initial experiments revealed that USP2 and USP7 cleaved Ub-PLA 2 , which liberated NBD in a dosedependent manner as reflected by the r 2 values of 0.965 and 0.953, respectively, when the x 2 factor of a polynomial fit of the curves was plotted against DUB concentration ( Fig. 2D; Supplemental Fig. S2B ). Thus, the Ub-PLA 2 fusion protein linked by an a-peptide bond is appropriate for monitoring purified DUB activity. The shape of the progress curves such as Figure 2C is due to several factors. First, there will be a lag in fluorescence appearance due to the coupled nature of the assay, and this is further complicated by the fact that the substrate for PLA 2 is largely micellar, requiring bulk transport of monomeric substrate before the PLA 2 can act. Thus, the use of a polynomial fit is purely phenomenological. The apparent relationship between the x 2 factor and enzyme amount may arise from the fact that [E] and [S] are similar in these assays. This means that the concentration of the ES complex leading to product formation will be determined by the fact that [ Subsequently, we profiled the relative activity of seven DUBs against Ub-PLA 2 (Table 1 ). These data revealed that the Ub-PLA 2 assay is an effective tool for profiling the activity of the largest class of DUBs, the USPs. There are likely >50 functional USPs; four of five USPs tested had robust activity against Ub-PLA 2 with negligible activity against the other UBL-PLA 2 conjugates. USP5 activity was enhanced in the presence of exogenous Ub (Supplemental Fig. S3) , consistent with its known specificity for polyubiquitin (Dang et al. 1998; Reyes-Turcu et al. 2006) . In contrast, the Ub-PLA 2 assay does not appear to be appropriate for measuring the activity of UCH enzymes such as UCH-L3. The Ub-PLA 2 assay also had low activity against a member of the Machado-Joseph disease domain proteases. However, it should be noted that at higher concentrations of JOSD2, dosedependent DUB activity was observed; a similar observation was made for JOSD2 with Ub-AMC (Supplemental Fig. S5) . Interestingly, the relatively poor in vitro cleavage of Ub conjugates by JOSD2 is consistent with a previous report of another member of the Machado-Joseph domain, Ataxin 3 (Mao et al. 2005) .\n\nWe chose to expand these initial observations by expressing and purifying three additional UBL-PLA 2 reporters, SUMO3-PLA 2 , NEDD8-PLA 2 , and ISG15-PLA 2 . The specificity and relative activity of five other isopeptidases were determined against the four UBL-PLA 2 reporter constructs ( Table 1) . As expected, SENP2 and ULP1 behaved as deSUMOylating enzymes and DEN1 as a deNEDDylase. Consistent with previous in vitro data, UBP43 was preferentially a deISGylase . In addition, in our hands PLpro is a deISGylase (Table 1; Fig. 3 ). Moreover, our data are in agreement with the very recent report that SARS Co-V PLpro functioned preferentially as a deISGylase (Lindner et al. 2007 ). In contrast, 20 nM of the related NL63 coronavirus protease (PLP2) appeared to cleave both Ub and ISG15 conjugates equally well when tested against 30 nM Ub-PLA 2 or 30 nM ISG15-PLA 2 . Follow-up experiments demonstrated that lower concentrations of PLP2 (1 nM) were able to generate a significantly greater signal when incubated with Ub-PLA 2 relative to ISG15-PLA 2 suggesting that PLP2 has a preference for Ub relative to ISG15 (Fig. 3) . Confirmatory kinetic experiments were uninformative due to a lack of substrate saturation (data not shown).\n\nRecently, Catic and colleagues profiled the DUB, deSUMOylase, and deISGylase activity of 22 DUBs (three of which overlapped with this study) using suicide inhibitors (Catic et al. 2007 ). Interestingly, both approaches found that USP2, USP5, and USP7 were DUBs; however, Catic and colleagues reported that USP2 and USP5 also bound to ISG15-vinyl sulfone, suggesting that they had deISGylating activity as well as DUB activity. In contrast, we did not detect any significant enzymatic deISGylating activity for USP2 or USP5 (Table 1) . Previously, the same group described the ability of USP5 to bind ISG15-vinyl sulfone, but to our knowledge the enzymatic cleavage of ISG15 conjugates by USP5 has not been demonstrated (Hemelaar et al. 2004) . No other reports of USP2 deISGylating activity have been published. This conflict highlights the importance of profiling isopeptidase activities by measuring proteolytic cleavage activity in addition to substrate binding.\n\nA number of DUB assays have been reported, including the commercially available Ub-AMC and Lanthascreen DUB substrate. In contrast to Ub-AMC and Lanthascreen DUB substrate, in the Ub-PLA 2 assay, the DUB cleaves a 14-kDa protein from the C terminus of Ub, likely representing a more physiological substrate for DUBs such as USP7 (Layfield et al. 1999 ). In addition, although Ub-AMC has been used to screen for inhibitors, its excitation wavelength is in the UV range, which is known to result in false positive rates as high as 20% in HTS (Liu et al. 2003; Tirat et al. 2005) . Importantly, comparable EC 50 values were obtained for the inhibition of USP2 by the specific DUB inhibitor Ub-ald as detected by Ub-PLA 2 /NBD C 6 -HPC or Ub-AMC, illustrating that the Ub-PLA 2 assay is appropriate for screening for inhibitors of isopeptidases (Fig. 4) . Further, the utility of the Ub-PLA 2 assay as a HTS screening platform for modulators of isopeptidase activity is illustrated by the assay exhibiting Z9 values ranging from 0.69 to 0.92 (Supplemental Table 1 ; Supplemental Fig. S7) . As in the case of all coupled enzyme assays, there is the possibility that a compound will directly modulate the activity of PLA 2 ; these compounds, however, can be rapidly eliminated by a counterscreen against free PLA 2 (Fig. 5D) . Taken together, these data demonstrate that with respect to the most numerous class of DUBs, the USPs, the Ub-PLA 2 assay is ideal for determining relative enzyme activity. In contrast, Ub-AMC and the Lanthascreen DUB substrate seem better suited to the UCH family of DUBs.\n\nFurther evidence of the utility of the UBL-PLA 2 assay was provided by the characterization of a previously reported DUB inhibitor (Aleo et al. 2006 ). In the initial report, NSC 632839 was not tested against purified proteins; rather, it was shown to inhibit cleavage of an Ub mimetic (z-LRGG-AMC) by transformed fibroblast lysates. In this study, we have expanded on the observations of Aleo and colleagues by demonstrating that NSC 632839 inhibits purified USP2-and USP7-mediated cleavage of Ub-PLA 2 (Fig. 5A,B ). In addition, NSC 632839 inhibits the deSUMOylase SENP2, suggesting that this compound is a relatively nonselective isopeptidase inhibitor (Fig. 5C) . Moreover, the isopeptidase inhibitory activity of NSC 632839 was confirmed by the observation that it did not inhibit free PLA 2 over the concentration range tested (Fig. 5D) . Thus, the UBL-PLA 2 assay is ideal for HTS applications such as screening for USP inhibitors.\n\nIn summary, data presented within have demonstrated that the UBL-PLA 2 reporter assay is a robust and sensitive assay. Further, as exemplified by PLpro and PLP2, the same platform can be used to discriminate DUB, deSUMOylase, deISGylase, and deNEDDylase activities. As such, the UBL-PLA 2 reporter system is beginning to provide new mechanistic insights in the field of UBL isopeptidases. Furthermore, additional reporter fusions consisting of alternative reporter enzymes that require a free amino terminus for activity fused to UBLs are currently in development (data not shown). Isopeptidases are clearly an emerging disease target, and we propose that the UBL-PLA 2 reporter system will be an extremely useful tool to identify novel inhibitors and activators of target USPs (Nicholson et al. 2007) . We estimate that >500,000 datapoints have been generated against ;40 therapeutically important isopeptidases using the current assay in 96-to 1536-well-plate formats. Importantly, when screened in a 1536-well-plate format, the assay exceeded a throughput of 400,000 data points per day with a Z9 value of 0.73 6 0.27 (PubChem AID 927; H. Veith and D. Auld, pers. comm.) . These results show that the assay is robust, and data describing the results of this and other screening campaigns will be the subject of future publications.\n\nUnless stated otherwise all reagents were obtained from Sigma Chemical Company and were at a minimum of reagent grade or better. Plasmids encoding UBP43 and JOSD2 were purchased from Open Biosystems. MagicMark size markers, NBD C 6 -HPC, and Lanthascreen DUB substrate were procured from Invitrogen. ECL reagents, ubiquitin aldehyde, and USP15 were procured from BIOMOL.\n\nThe mature mouse group X PLA 2 (amino acids 29-151) was cloned and expressed in BL21 (DE3) bacteria (Novagen) using standard molecular biology techniques (see Supplemental Table  2 for primer information). 6His-Ub-PLA 2 was expressed and purified as described (Gasparian et al. 2003; Leach and Michael 2005) . Subsequently, PLA 2 was also subcloned into the bacterial expression vectors pET24d-6His-SUMO3, pET24d-6His-NEDD8, and pET24d-6His-ISG15 to generate recombinant 6His-SUMO3-PLA 2 , 6His-NEDD8-PLA 2 , and 6His-ISG15-PLA 2 , respectively. Expression and purification were as described above. Free catalytically active PLA 2 was generated by incubating SUMO3-PLA 2 with SENP2 overnight at room temperature to ensure complete cleavage prior to affinity subtraction with Ni-NTA beads.\n\nThe cloning, expression, and purification from BL21 (DE3) bacteria of the catalytic core fragments of USP2 core (amino acids 259-605), USP8 core (amino acids 710-1110), SENP2 (amino acids 366-590), SARS-CoV PLpro (amino acids 1541-1855), and full-length JOSD2 were performed using standard molecular biology techniques (see Supplemental Table 2 for primer information). Codon-optimized PLP2 cDNA (amino acids 1565-1894) was prepared synthetically by DNA2.0 (www. dna20.com/index.php?pageID-78) before expressing and purifying from BL21 (DE3) bacteria. Full-length USP7 and UBP43 were cloned, expressed, and purified from Sf9 cells using standard molecular biology techniques (see Supplemental Table 2 for primer information). The isopeptidases USP5, UCH-L3, and ULP1 core were expressed and purified as described (Larsen et al. 1996; Malakhov et al. 2004; Russell and Wilkinson 2005; Marblestone et al. 2006 ). with anti-Ub (Sigma Chemical Company) and anti-rabbit-HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), and visualizing with ECL reagents.\n\nUnless stated otherwise, recombinant isopeptidase was mixed with UBL-PLA 2 and NBD C 6 -HPC to final concentrations of 20 nM, 30 nM, and 20 mM, respectively, in a total volume of 100 mL in a well in a black-walled 96-well-plate (Greiner Bio-One). All dilutions were performed in PLA 2 assay buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mM CaCl 2 , and 2 mM b-mercaptoethanol). Unless stated otherwise, the increase in fluorescence intensity over time was determined on a Perkin-Elmer Envision fluorescence plate reader with excitation and emission filters of 475 nm and 555 nm, respectively, at room temperature. Net RFUs were determined by subtracting the blank RFU value (20 mM NBD C 6 -HPC in PLA 2 assay buffer) from each data point.\n\nUSP2 core, Ub-PLA 2 dose dependency experiments were performed by mixing 0-160 nM USP2 core with 30 nM Ub-PLA 2 and 20 mM NBD C 6 -HPC in a total volume of 100 mL as above. The data were fit to a fourth-order polynomial equation such that y \u00bc a + bx + cx 2 + dx 3 + ex 4 using GraphPad Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software). The linearity of signal (relative to isopeptidase concentration) was determined by performing linear regression of x 2 factor (c) versus isopeptidase concentration.\n\nRelative isopeptidase activity against various UBL-PLA 2 fusions was determined by adding the test isopeptidase to a final concentration of 20 nM in combination with 20 mM NBD C 6 -HPC and 30 nM of the individual UBL-PLA 2 reporter constructs (Ub-PLA 2 , SUMO3-PLA 2 , NEDD8-PLA 2 , or ISG15-PLA 2 ). Net RFU was determined as described above and the signal (isopeptidase + reporter) to background (reporter) ratio was determined within the linear range of the assay (30-45 min) before expressing the S/B as a percentage of the control isopeptidases: USP2 (Ub-PLA 2 ), SENP2 (SUMO3-PLA 2 ), PLpro (ISG15-PLA 2 ) and DEN1 (NEDD8-PLA 2 ). Follow-up experiments were performed by adding the test isopeptidase to a final concentration of 1 nM in combination with 20 mM NBD C 6 -HPC and 30 nM of Ub-PLA 2 or ISG15-PLA 2 . Data (RFU) from the 45-min time point were used for analysis. The UBL-PLA 2 assay reagents are available from LifeSensors, Inc. (www.lifesensors.com).\n\nIn a 96-well-plate, 31.25 nM USP2 core was incubated with a concentration range of Ub-aldehyde for 30 min before supplementation with an equal volume of 54.4 nM Ub-PLA 2 /40 mM NBD C 6 -HPC or 632 nM Ub-AMC (BIOMOL or Boston Biochem). The increase in fluorescence was monitored over time using an Ascent Fluoroskan using the following wavelengths: Ex 460 ; Em 538 (Ub-PLA 2 ) or Ex 355 ; Em 460 (Ub-AMC). The RFU values within the initial linear range were normalized such that reporter alone \u00bc 100% inhibition and USP2 core + reporter \u00bc 0% inhibition and were plotted using GraphPad Prism 4.0. EC 50 values were determined by fitting the data to a sigmoidal dose response (variable slope) equation.\n\nIn a 96-well-plate, 40 nM USP2, 40 nM USP7, or 20 nM SENP2 was preincubated with a concentration range of NSC 632839 (NCI/NIH developmental therapeutics program) or control for 30 min before supplementation with an equal volume of 60 nM Ub-PLA 2 /40 mM NBD C 6 -HPC (USP2 or 7) or 20 nM SUMO3-PLA 2 /40 mM NBD C 6 -HPC (SENP2). Relative activity of the enzymes was determined by measuring the RFU values at single time points within the initial linear range (USP, 50 min; USP7, 50 min; and SENP2, 30 min). The RFU values within the initial linear range were normalized such that isopeptidase + vehicle \u00bc 0% inhibition and isopeptidase + NEM \u00bc 100% inhibition. The EC 50 values were determined as above. The inhibitory activity of the test compound against the reporter enzyme PLA 2 was performed as described above except there was no preincubation step and the data were normalized such that free PLA 2 + vehicle \u00bc 0% inhibition and free PLA 2 + EDTA \u00bc 100% inhibition. PLA 2 activity was determined 8 min after the addition of the reagents.\n\nSupplemental materials consist of tables of the Z9 values and PCR primers. Figures illustrate dose-dependent USP2 and USP7 activity, enhancement of USP5 activity in the presence of mono-Ub, dose-dependent UCH-L3 activity (measured by Ub-AMC), dose-dependent JOSD2 activity (measured by Ub-PLA 2 or Ub-AMC), a comparison of Ub-PLA 2 and Ub-AMC or the Lanthascreen substrate, USP2 Z9 data distribution, and the utility of the UBL-PLA 2 assay for monitoring the fractionation of wholecell lysates."}
