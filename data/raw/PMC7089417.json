{"title": "Synthetic approaches toward stilbenes and their related structures", "body": "Nature has been a source of medicinal compounds for thousands of years and large number of drugs have been isolated from natural products [1, 2]. Stilbene (1,2-diphenylethene) does not exist in nature itself, but its derivatives as plant secondary metabolites are present in various plant species and some of them are considered phytoalexins [2\u20135]. Stilbene and its analogues hold enormous potential importance due to their diverse spectrum of biological applications such as anticancer [6\u201310], antiproliferative [11, 12], antiangiogenesis [11, 12], antimicrobial [13\u201317], antileukemic [17, 18], antioxidant [17, 19, 20], anti-inflammatory [17], anti-HIV [21, 22], anti herpes simplex virus [23] and tyrosine kinase inhibitors [24, 25]. Stilbenes exist in E and Z conformations each eliciting different pharmacological activities. Research revealed that the E form or trans exhibits more potent anticancer activity compared to the Z form or cis form. The trans or E form is thermodynamically more stable. Many trans-stilbenes such as resveratrol 1, oxyresveratrol 2, pterostilbene 3, piceatannol 4, isorhapotigenin 5 and cis stilbene, combretastatin 6 (Fig. 1) exhibited varieties of biological activities [1, 4, 25]. Hydroxy stilbene, i.e., resveratrol (3,4,5-trihydroxystilbene), a non-flavonoid polyphenolic present in grapes, peanuts, berries and red wine was investigated due to its role in plants\u2019 defense against pathogens and pharmacological properties [26\u201332]. It shows significant effect against cancer, AIDS, antagonistic activity against aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and estrogenic potency [33, 34]. Pterostilbene is used in the treatment of resistant hematology malignancies, diabetes and as antitumor agent [34].\n\nCombretastatin A-4 (CA-4), a vascular disrupting agent (VDAs) and a vascular targeting agent (VTAs) present in the bark of Combretum caffrum, acts as antimitotic and exhibited antineoplastic, antioxidant and antiestrogenic properties [1, 35\u201337].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe non-availability of naturally occurring stilbenes in sufficient quantities dictated the development of synthetic methodologies for their preparation at large scale [3] such as Wittig or Horner\u2013Wadsworth\u2013Emmons (HWE) olefination, Perkin aldol condensation, transition metal coupling, i.e., Mizoroki\u2013Heck, Negishi, Stille, Sonogashira, Suzuki\u2013Miyaura, Grubbs & McMurry, Knoevenagel\u2013Doebner, Ramberg\u2013Bucklund reactions [7, 34, 38, 39]. Stilbene derivatives also show industrial applications in electrochemical, dyes, dye laser, coloring textiles, organic LED, fluorescent and optical brightners [40\u201343]. Likhitwitayawuid identified dimeric stilbenes as tyrosinase inhibitor [44], whereas Momotake and Arai wrote a review on photochemistry and photophysics of stilbene dendrimers and related compounds [45]. Shen et al. [46] presented an overview on natural stilbenes. Chaudhary et al. and Nam published reviews on Combretastatin A-4 analogues as anticancer and antimitotic antitumor agents, respectively [35, 36]. Recently, Reinisalo et al. [47] presented a review on polyphenol stilbenes, J\u00f8rgensen reviewed the photochemical oxidative cyclization of stilbenes and stilbenoids (the Mallory-reaction) [48], Savage et al. [49] presented a review of semi-rigid, stilbene-containing alternating copolymers, Chong et al. [50] contributed a review on metabolism and roles of stilbenes in plants, and Waldeck reviewed the photoisomerization dynamics of stilbenes [51]. The current review covers the synthetic strategies to develop convenient methods for the construction stilbene architecture and related analogues over the past few decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to effective control of cancer by selenium-containing compounds, Yan et al. [30] prepared benzoselenazole-stilbene by the coupling of stilbene 10 with ebselen 11 as outlined in Scheme 1. For this purpose, phosphonate 8 was prepared in three steps by reacting nitrobenzaldehyde 7 with sodium borohydride in methanol, the resulting product was then treated with phosphorus tribromide in the presence of pyridine and finally refluxed with triethyl phosphite. Further, compound 8 was converted to amino stilbene 9 in 74% yield by reacting with benzaldehydes followed by reduction of nitro group with stannous chloride. Amino stilbene 9 was subsequently coupled with 2-(chloroseleno)benzoyl chloride 10 in presence of sodium hydride to accomplish desired benzoselenazole-stilbene 11 in 55% yield.\n\nBhat and Pezzuto [52] described chemotherapeutic property of stilbene-based resveratrol. Thus, keeping in mind the perspective applications of resveratrol, Paul et al. [53] synthesized both cis \n15 and trans-stilbenes 16 via a Wittig reaction between phosphonium salt 13, which is derived from compound 12 with appropriate aromatic aldehydes 14 but these stilbenes 15 and 16 were formed in 9\u201352% yields. Mizuno et al. [54] synthesized derivatives of pterostilbene by using a Wittig reaction similar to the route shown in Scheme 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimoni et al. [26] prepared carbamates and uracil derivatives 20a\u2013c from cis-stilbene to test their potential antitumor activity. The Wittig reaction of aldehyde 17 with Wittig salt 13, followed by reduction in the presence of Zn, generated hydrochloride salt 18 in 85% yield. Compound 18 was converted into intermediate isocyanate 19 by treating it with base and trichloromethyl chloroformate. The intermediate isocyanate 19 was finally converted into water soluble urea 20a and carbamates 20b\u2013c in 70\u201389% yield as outlined in Scheme 3.\n\nRoman et al. [8] prepared E and Z stilbenes as anti-invasive agents by different methods. E-stilbenes 24 were prepared in 48\u201399% yield using a Wittig reaction, in which benzyl bromide 21 was converted to phosphonate 22 and subsequently transformed to stilbenes 24 in an E/Z ratio 99:1 by reacting with benzaldehydes 23 under nitrogen atmosphere. A solvent-free Arbusov reaction generated triethylphosphite from benzyl bromide followed by a Horner\u2013Wadsworth\u2013Emmons reaction in (THF/KO\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$^{\\mathrm {t}}$$\\end{document}tBu) and afforded E-selectivity with higher yields as shown in Scheme 4a. Z-stilbenes 28 were formed in 13\u201387% yield through the Sonogashira coupling of phenylacetylene 25 with aryl iodides 26, which produced alkynes 27 in 92\u201399% yield. A wide range of alkynes 27 were converted into Z-stilbenes 28 via hydrosilylation (Chalk\u2013Harrod mechanism) and TBAF mediated conversion of vinylsilanes. Lindlar\u2019s catalyst also afforded the Z-stilbenes as shown in Scheme 4b.\n\nLi et al. [5] followed the same Wittig\u2013Horner reaction to generate hydroxy stilbenes 31 as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) inhibitors. Phosphonates of 3,5-dimethoxybenzyl chloride 30 were obtained by an Arbuzov reaction in (n-Bu)\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$_{{4}}$$\\end{document}4NI. The reaction of phosphonate anion from compound 30 with aryl aldehydes gave E-stilbenes, which subsequently were demethylated to hydroxylated stilbenes 31 in quantitative yield as outlined in Scheme 5.\n\nGao et al. [17] synthesized radiolabeled stilbenes 33b and 34b as probes for cancer by treating Wittig salt 13 with 4-fluorobenzaldehyde 32b and 4-nitrobenzaldehyde 32a, respectively. Radiolabel precursors 33a and 34a were formed in 30\u201360% yield.

[55] synthesized pinacolyl boronate stilbenes 38 as lipogenic inhibitors using a Wittig strategy. Wittig salt 36 was formed as white solid in 92% yield from 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-2-p-tolyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane 35 in two steps, bromination was followed by a Wittig reaction. Wittig salt 36 on treatment with aldehydes 37 afforded the final products 38 in 72\u201385% yield as outlined in Scheme 7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSrivastava and Lee [56] reported the use of a Wittig reaction for the synthesis of hybrid stilbenes 43 and 44 bearing a quinoline moiety to test their anticancer activity. Wittig salt 42 was prepared from benzyl bromide 41 in 60\u201380% yield while quinoline-3-carbaldehydes 40 were synthesized in 15\u201389% yield from aniline 39 through a Vilsmeier\u2013Haack reaction. The reaction of Wittig salt 42 with quinoline-3-carbaldehyde 40 resulted in cis-product 43 in 21\u201375% yield and trans-product 44 in 2\u201310% yield as described in Scheme 8.\n\n\n\n\n\nJung et al. [57] prepared stilbenes (E/Z ratio 1/1) derivatives 50\u201356 in 77\u201390% yield as tyrosine phosphatase 1B inhibitors from the reaction of protected aromatic aldehyde 49 and aromatic ylide 47. Deprotection of desired stilbene 50 was accomplished in 86% yield in the presence of tetrabutylammonium fluoride. The ester functionality of stilbene derivative 50 was reduced to stilbenes 52 and 53 and their subsequent deprotection afforded 54\u201356 in 77\u201390% yields as shown in Scheme 9a. Methyl-4-(chloromethyl) benzoate 57 was transformed into methyl-3[4-(iodomethyl)phenyl]-2-propenoate 60 in 90% yield via compounds 58 and 59. Phosphonium salt 61 was obtained in 91% yield from compound 60. Reaction of compound 61 with aldehyde 62 provided stilbene 63 in 62% yield. Final phenolic stilbene 64 was obtained in 28% yield by demethylation of stilbene 63 as shown in Scheme 9b. In continuation of their work, Jung et al. [58] obtained amides 65\u201366 by treating compound 51 with amines. Subsequent deprotection afforded E-stilbenes 67-68 in 60\u201374% yield as shown in Scheme 9c, and their antioxidant and neuroprotective potential was also evaluated.\n\nAchalkumar and Yelamaggad [59] first reported the coupling of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione with E-stilbenes 72 and 75 to form light emitting tris(N-salicylideneaniline) [TSANs] 77-78 as shown in Scheme 10. Diethyl(4-nitrobenzyl)phosphate 70 was prepared in 70% yield in two steps from 4-nitrotoluene 69 by benzylic bromination and a Michalis\u2013Arbuzov reaction. The intermediate 70 furnished 1,2-bis(alkoxy)-4-(4-nitrostyryl)-benzenes 72 in 60\u201362% yield by a HWE reaction with 3,4-dialkoxybenzaldehydes 71 and subsequent reduction using indium as a source of reducing agent. 3,4,5-Trialkoxy aldehyde 74 was obtained in 68\u201380% yield by lithium aluminum hydride mediated reduction of the ester functional group of 73 into alcohols followed by oxidation of alcohols into aldehydes using PCC as oxidizing agent. The reaction of aldehyde 74 with intermediate 70 resulted in a nitrostilbene followed by reduction of nitro group to amine 75 in 60\u201364% yields. Finally, treatment of triformylphloroglucinol 76 with stilbenes 72 and 75 gave desired TSANs 77 and 78, respectively, in 60\u201371% yields as yellow crystals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelluti et al. [60] understood the biological importance of stilbene analogues and coumarins; therefore, they embedded coumarin units in various stilbene analogues. Methylcoumarines 79 generated intermediate phosphonic acid diethyl esters 80 in 60\u201381% yield. The intermediate 80 underwent HWE reaction with aldehydes, which afforded stilbene derivatives 81 in an E/Z ratio of 9/1 in 51\u201372% yield as outlined in Scheme 11.\n\n\n\n\n\nMcNulty and McLeod [61] investigated two Wittig routes for the synthesis of stilbene analogue E-pterostilbene 88. Classical Wittig olefination usually yields poor E/Z stereocontrol, and it is highly desirable to improve stereoselectivity. In route A, phosphonium salt 86 was prepared from 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid 82 by converting acid 82 into ester 83 in 95% yield. Reduction of ester 83 into corresponding alcohol 84 was accomplished in 92% yield, which on direct reaction with triphenylphosphine HCl or through formation of benzyl chloride 85 (93% yield) gave compound 86 in 99% yield. However, compound 86 failed to react with 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde 87a, but after protection of hydroxyl group 87b\u2013d gave pterostilbenes 3, 88a-c in 91% yield as shown in Scheme 12a. In route B, p-hydroxyphosphonium salt 90 was obtained in 91% yield using the above procedure. However, protection of the hydroxy group was required for the reaction of phosphonium salt 90 with an aldehyde. Here a deprotected phosphonium salt does not react with an aldehyde. Final product 3 was obtained in an E/Z ratio of 95/5 in 91% yield as shown in Scheme 12b.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnthracene-based stilbene derivatives 96 containing a 1,3,4-oxadiazole moiety were synthesized by Li and He [62] as shown in Scheme 13, and they also evaluated their optical properties. Anthracene-substituted 1,3,4-oxadiazole intermediate 94 was obtained in 78% yield by refluxing 4-methylbenzohydrazide 91 with anthracene-9-carbaldehyde 92 giving a yellow solution 93 to which chloramines-T were added and brominated with NBS to furnish compound 94. Compound 94 furnished phosphonate ester 95 in 95% yield which, followed by a HWE reaction with aromatic aldehydes, afforded desired products 96 in 83\u201393% yield.\n\nLu and He [63, 64] synthesized 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives containing stilbene and naphthalene units 101 from azomethine. Azomethine 98 was prepared from hydrazide 91 and aldehyde 97 [62]. Reaction of azomethine 98 with chloramine-T gave an intermediate having an oxadiazole ring. Bromonation afforded an oxadiazole bearing benzyl bromide 99. Esterification of compound 99 followed by a Wittig\u2013Horner reaction furnished product 101 in 81\u201391% yield as showed in Scheme 14.\n\n\n\n\n\nZhu et al. [43] synthesized conjugated stilbenes carrying an oxadiazole moiety 107 to study their optical properties. Oxadiazole 104 was formed in 60% yield by direct reaction of p-toluic acid 102 with hydrazine hydrate 103 in the presence of polyphosphoric acid. Bromination of oxadiazole 104 followed by esterification with triethylphosphate afforded 106 in 80% yield. A Horner\u2013Wadsworth\u2013Emmons reaction of phosphonate ester 106 with appropriate aldehydes gave target stilbenes carrying an oxadiazole moiety 107 in 92% and 93% yield as outlined in Scheme 15a. In continuation of his work, Zhu et al. [65] synthesized two novel UV protectant compounds 109 in 35% yield and 68% yield by treating phosphonate ester 106 with respective aldehydes 108 under HWE reaction conditions as shown in Scheme 15b.\n\n\n\n\n\nHahm et al. [66] reported the synthesis of photosensitive polyimide (PSPI), ODPA-stilbene PSPI 115 that could be used as a liquid crystal display. (4-Nitrobenzyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide 111 was prepared from 4-nitrobenzyl bromide 110 in 83% yield.

[67] hybridized trans-stilbene with quinazolines to develop potent anticancer agents. The reaction of styrene 117 with bromobenzaldehyde 116 using palladium-catalyzed Mizoroki\u2013Heck reaction conditions provided stilbene 118 in 90% yield. Treatment of isatoic anhydride 119 with relevant primary amines generated anthranilamide 120 in 85\u201395% yield, which on reflux with stilbene 118 furnished 121 in 90\u201395% yields. As described in Scheme 17, compound 121 was oxidized to quinazoline 122 in 75\u201390% yield using tetrabutyl ammonium bromide in the presence of base.\n\nAs indicated in Scheme 18, Marti-Centelles et al. [68] described palladium-catalyzed preparations of stilbenes 124 by the reaction of styrene 117 with halogenated derivatives 123 under two different reaction conditions (Methods A and B). Both methodologies afforded desired stilbenes in good yields (65\u201397%).\n\nA relatively new route to synthesize antitubulin agent, biaryl aryl stilbene 131 by utilizing Suzuki and Mizoroki\u2013Heck cross coupling reactions, was disclosed by Kumar et al. [10]. Bromination of 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde 125 followed by Suzuki cross coupling with aryl boronic acids 127 produced intermediate 4,5,6-trimethoxybiphenyl-2-carbaldehyde 128 in 88\u201395% yield. Wittig reaction of aldehyde 128 furnished 2,3,4-trimethoxy-6-vinylbiphenyls 129 followed by palladium-catalyzed Mizoroki\u2013Heck coupling with aryl halides 130 afforded biaryl stilbene 131 in 88\u201390% yield as shown in Scheme 19a. Reddy et al. [69] synthesized nitrovinyl stilbenes 133 by using a similar methodology. Intermediate 126 produced stilbene 132 in 84\u201397% yield by way of a palladium-catalyzed Mizoroki\u2013Heck reaction with styrene. The reaction of compound 132 with nitromethane gave nitrovinyl stilbenes 133 in 79\u201396% yield as shown in Scheme 19b.\n\nAlbert et al. [70] followed a Mizoroki\u2013Heck reaction protocol using triethanolamine, which acts as ligand, solvent as well as base [71] allowing the economic synthesis of E-stilbenes 3, 137 to evaluate their antimicrobial activity. Substituted styrenes 135 were synthesized in 58\u201375% yield from benzaldehyde 134 by a Wittig reaction. Then, a Mizoroki\u2013Heck reaction between styrene 135 and halogenated benzene 136 gave E-stilbenes 3, 137 in good yields as outlined in Scheme 20.\n\nKhan et al. [72] synthesized stilbene derivatives 139 in 40\u201389% yields by mesylation of 2-iodobenzyl alcohol 138 with dimethylmalonate, which gave intermediate in 68% yield followed by a Mizoroki\u2013Heck reaction with styrenes then gave stilbenes 139 as shown in Scheme 21. Further stilbene derivatives 139 were used in iodonium-promoted carbocyclizations to furnish a mixture of structurally complex indanes 140a in 18\u201355% yields and tetrhydronaphthalenes 140b in 18\u201359% yields with three new stereogenic centers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKabir et al. [13] reported the Pd-catalyzed regioselective synthesis of E-stilbene 144 in 74% yield by a Negishi cross coupling between arylvinyl iodide 143 and arylzinc reagent 142. Arylvinyl iodide 143 was prepared in 84% yield [73], whereas arylzinc 142 was obtained by transmetallation of hydrogen-lithium exchange product of arylbromide 141 with zinc(II)chloride as outlined in Scheme 22.\n\nMcDonald et al. [74] synthesized aza-stilbenes 147 to check their potency against the c-RAF enzyme. A range of styrenes 146 were created by the palladium-catalyzed Stille coupling of 5-bromo-nicotinonitrile 145 with tributylvinyl tin. Mizoroki\u2013Heck cross coupling of substituted styrenes 146 with bromo benzene furnished aza-stilbenes 147 mostly in moderate yields as shown in Scheme 23.\n\nLara-Ochoa et al.

This method reduces work-up, generates less waste and saves time and energy. Initially, styrene 117 was generated by dehydrohalogenation of (2-bromoethyl)benzene 156, whereas the same styrene 117 can also be accessed from aldehyde 157 and phosphonium salt 42 using a Wittig reaction protocol as described in Scheme 26.

Reduction of 174 and mesylation of compound 175 followed by subsequent nucleophilic substitution reaction furnished stilbenes 176. On the other hand, 2-iodobenzyl chloride 177 also gave stilbenes 176 using the same route through compound 178. These substituted stilbenes 176 were used as precursors to produce dihydronaphthalene 179 in 50\u201390% yields, which was then transformed to benzofluorenes 180 in 30\u201390% yields through a one-pot procedure using phenylselenium chloride as selenylating reagent with a Lewis acid as shown in Scheme 30a.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShahzad et al.

Stilbene-based carboxylic acids 175 were obtained in 87\u2013100% yields from corresponding esters by using lithium hydroxide. Compound 175 and its analogues were cyclized to dihydroisocoumarins 183 in 50\u201397% and isocoumarins 184 in 81\u201399% yields using N-phenylselenosuccinimide (N-PSS). Because of the high cost of N-phenylselenosuccinimide (N-PSS), another methodology was developed by Shahzad and coworkers using diphenyl diselenide and [bis-(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo]benzene to synthesize isocoumarins 184. Optimization concluded that 10 mol% use of catalyst diphenyl diselenide gave desired isocoumarins in excellent yield as shown in Scheme 30c.\n\nKachhadia et al. [84] designed stilbene-based hydroxamates 190 to inhibit histone deacetylases (HDACs), which are the cause of epigenetic states related to cancer. For this purpose, 4-formylcinnamic acid was converted to ester 186, which undergoes Perkin condensation with substituted phenylacetic acids 185 to generate acrylic acids 187 in 47% yield. Compounds 187 were then reduced to alcohols and oxidized into aldehydes 188 in 28% yield using PCC. Compound 188 underwent reductive amination to amine 189.

[89] synthesized silicone-based triazine\u2013stilbene compounds 228 in three steps as shown in Scheme 40. In first step, the reaction of 4,4-diaminostilbene-2,2-disulfonic acid 223 with an ice-cold slurry of cyanuric chloride 224 generated intermediate 225. In the second step, intermediate 225 was condensed with aromatic amines at pH 6. In the final step, compound 226 reacted with 3-aminopropyltrimethoxy silane 227 to yield 228 in 92\u201394%. Um et al. [90, 91] used a similar methodology to synthesize triazine\u2013stilbene as fluorescent brighteners.\n\nUm et al. [41] prepared substituted triazine\u2013stilbene 232 to test their brightness. Intermediate 230 was produced by reacting stilbene 229 with 2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-triazine 224 followed by treatment with different amines. Addition of phenolic derivatives to 231 gave products 232 in 70\u201398% yield as shown in Scheme 41.\n\nUnderstanding the photophysical properties of stilbene, Buruiana et al. [92] prepared stilbene-containing polyacrylates 234. The monomers (SUM) 233 were produced in 96% yield by adding 2-isocyanatoethylmethacrylate to trans-4-stilbene methanol. SUM (monomers) 233 were copolymerized with methyl methacrylate (MMA) by free radical mechanism.

In the last decade, different synthetic approaches have been devised to design novel stilbene-based compounds. The classical approaches involve famous named reactions such as the Wittig reaction/Horner\u2013Wadsworth\u2013Emmons reaction, Mizroki\u2013Heck reaction, Suzuki cross coupling reaction, Stille cross coupling reaction, Sonogashira cross coupling reaction, and Perkin condensation to synthesize stilbenes and related structures. It must be highlighted that these reactions have changed the science of synthesis. The most essential synthetic methodologies to synthesize E and Z-stilbene analogues have been summarized in this article. However, in our view, there will be further developments for the production of novel stilbene-based structures in the coming years. We hope will be useful for the scientific community, especially for those interested in the synthesis of stilbene analogues, which have a wide spectrum of applications in medicinal and material chemistry."}
