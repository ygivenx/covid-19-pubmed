{"title": "Appendix A Emergency Preparedness, Response & Recovery Checklist Beyond the Emergency Management Plan", "body": "basis. 1 Many state laws and regulations require hospitals and other licensed healthcare facilities to engage in emergency planning and drilling. 2 Emergency preparedness, including establishing and maintaining an emergency management plan, also is one of the required seven disciplines of \"Management of the Environment of Care\" for organizations accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations 3 Healthcare providers experience unexpected crises in different contexts, ranging from events where no essential hospital services are compromised to a disaster that affects all hospital operations on both large and small scales. Emergency events may be externally triggered (e.g., natural disasters; outbreaks of new, deadly diseases; or vicious acts of terrorism) that result in a massive demand on a healthcare system. 3 See, e.g., Joint Comm'n on Accreditation of Healthcare Orgs., Hospital Accreditation Standards (HAS) Standards EC4.10, EC4.20 (2004) (providing a detailed checklist of required activities and requiring a hospital to conduct drills regularly to test emergency management). Cf. National Fire Protection Ass'n, Standard 1600 on Disaster/Emergency Management and Business Continuity Programs \u00a7 \u00a7 1 1 1 2 (2004) (establishing a standard common set of criteria for assessing and implementing emergency and disaster management), available at www.nfpa.org/PDF/nfpa1600.pdf (last visited Sept. 13, 2004) . 4 See North Carolina Hosp. Ass'n, Hospital Emergency Incident Command System (1992) (discussing both the Incident Command System and Hospital Emergency Incident Command System disaster response plans). 5 Emergencies also may be entirely institutionbased (e.g., a small fire in the data center, a burst pipe in the emergency department, or a hospital-wide labor strike). Regardless of whether emergencies are external or internal to the organization, such events may impair healthcare operations and thereby trigger the implementation of a hospital's emergency management plan and its Incident Command Structure (ICS) or Hospital Emergency Incident Command System (HEICS) 4 response.\n\nFor example, Tropical Storm Allison created such an emergency situation for the Memorial Hermann Healthcare System in June 2001, when downtown Houston, TX, and the hospital endured more than twenty inches of rain in a threeday period. The flooding water overwhelmed precautions that had been designed to withstand a 100-year flood; destroyed a pathology laboratory; dispersed medical waste and biohazards; submerged mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems; damaged communication systems; and required the complete evacuation of the Memorial Hermann Hospital and the Memorial Hermann Children's Hospital. 5 And, of course, all Americans remember the heroism and professionalism exhibited by healthcare workers in the hours and days after the terrorist attacks in New York, NY, and Washington, D.C., on September 11, 2001. Or consider the example of the North York General Hospital in Toronto, Canada, which experienced a different emergency situation during May and August of 2003, when an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) occurred in its orthopedic unit. 6 The hospital ultimately had ninety SARS patients, forty-four of them from the hospital's staff. North York General closed its doors to any new patients, and had to find ways to treat those patients who already had or who developed SARS. Hospital staff assumed significant personal risk to treat a new type of disease that affected their friends and colleagues. They did so under extraordinarily difficult circumstances that included a workplace quarantine and the intense scrutiny of a frightened media and populace. 7 Remember also that, in the summer of 2003, large portions of New England and the mid-Atlantic states suffered power outages as a result of a falling tree limb cutting power lines in Ohio. Community members flocked to hospitals across the region for shelter even as the hospitals were operating on emergency-generator power, canceling elective procedures, and frequently functioning with compromised computer and other systems. As recently as late summer of 2004, four hurricanes devastated the state of Florida, causing the evacuation of local hospitals.\n\nAccordingly, it is vitally important that healthcare providers maintain a constant state of emergency preparedness to ensure appropriate response and recovery within the quickest possible timeframe. Such preparedness encompasses four phases: (i) preparation; (ii) mitigation; (iii) response; and (iv) recovery. 8 Without proper planning, a crisis for the provider may result in unintended consequences involving a potential temporary or permanent business failure, thus adding a crucial community institution to the list of the event's casualties. The purpose of this 6 See Susan Kwolek, Lessons Learned from SARS: The Story of North York General Hospital, in Am. Health Law. Ass'n, SARS: Legal and Risk Management Lessons Learned from Toronto to Atlanta Teleconference (Nov. 13, 2003). 7 Id. 8 National Fire Protection Ass'n, supra note 3, \u00a7 5 1 2. 9 For additional information relating to operational issues, please see the following websites: Am.

By considering the following points, a healthcare provider will be in a better position to promote success for the organization as it confronts unexpected events.\n\nThis Checklist should not be construed as legal advice, however, and does not purport to encompass all possible legal and other issues that may apply in the event of such an emergency situation; each crisis presents its own unique circumstances. Finally, not every crisis will trigger all of the issues identified in this Checklist.\n\nAdditionally, public health emergencies have the potential for far-reaching effects on the U.S. population at large, and thus pose unique legal and operational issues for local health systems. A public health emergency, as defined in the Model State Emergency Health Powers Act, is an occurrence or imminent threat of a health condition caused by bioterrorism or the appearance of a novel or previously controlled or eradicated infectious agent or biological toxin, and poses a high probability of a large number of deaths, serious long-term disabilities, or significant risk of substantial future harm in the affected populations. 10 The challenges inherent in quickly identifying the disease agent, mode of transmission, and best treatment options significantly affect both the well-being of healthcare workers and the daily operations of healthcare facilities. This is true particularly in the event that it becomes necessary for the public health authority to assume control of a hospital.\n\nTrue community-wide emergency preparedness therefore hinges on close coordination and cooperation between public health agencies, healthcare organizations, and their respective legal counsel. Protecting communities from man-made and naturally occurring threats alike requires legal counsel-for both public health agencies and healthcare providers-to establish a clear understanding of legal roles and operational responsibilities of each party, well in advance of any public health emergency. Thi s is important particularly to minimize the loss of lives and reduce the potential economic consequences of these events. To further this goal, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Public Health Law Program has developed the Community Public Health Legal Preparedness Initiative (Initiative). 11 Through intensive, community-based, one-day workshops, this Initiative aims to build vibrant and enduring partnerships between legal counsel for private and public hospitals, as well as with other healthcare organizations and public health agencies, to enhance the use of law as a tool to advance community health through prevention and health promotion. Resources to facilitate this public health/healthcare partnership are listed in Appendices D and E of this Checklist.\n\nThis Checklist is organized to reflect the hierarchy established by the ICS structure, which provides a scalable approach to emergency management. The ICS structure offers a model for the immediate (and hopefully short-term) ad hoc restructuring of an organization around functional (rather than administrative) lines to better meet the 11 demands of a given emergency situation. ICS identifies key roles within an organization, addresses responsibilities for each role, and assigns individuals and resources to those roles based on their availability as needed during an emergency. The ICS structure is scalable, enabling its use in the full range of emergency situations that may disrupt a healthcare provider's operations. The ICS employs an \"Incident Commander\" with four \"sections\" that report to the commander: (i) Operations; (ii) Planning; (iii) Logistics; and (iv) Finance, each with its own \"chief.\" 12\n\nThe Incident Commander has overall authority and responsibility for operations during an emergency event. 13 The Incident Commander's main job is to allocate resources and ensure safety. Any function not otherwise assigned also is the responsibility of the Incident Commander. In addition to the four identified Incident Command System roles, the Incident Commander has direct reports from the Liaison Officer, Public Information Officer (PIO), Communications Officer, Safety/Security Officer, 14 and Recorder/Transcriber.\n\nIt is critical for the organization's personnel and medical staff to be familiar with its emergency management plan and ICS. In particular, personnel and medical staff should be aware of the following:\n\n1. What constitutes a disaster that could trigger the implementation of the organization's emergency management plan and how is a disaster declared by the facility?\n\n2. What code is called via the overhead paging system to announce the disaster and trigger implementation of the institution's emergency management plan? 3. Where is the organization's staff to report after an emergency is declared, and how will the organization account for their location? How will staff member locations be recorded (e.g., by sign-in sheet)? a. \n\nThe Command Center is the location from which the response to the emergency will be coordinated. It needs to be located and equipped in such a manner as to facilitate an appropriate response to the disaster, regardless of whether its scope is large or small. \n\nThe Incident Commander is the individual who assumes overall authority for the institution's response to the emergency. In an institution that implements a classic ICS structure, the commander role may be filled by almost anyone in the institution who identifies and announces the emergency until such time as someone in an administrative chain of command superior to that person takes over the role of Incident Commander. 16 In a HEICS system, the role of Incident Commander may be filled by individuals who have preassigned roles that will automatically slot into the command structure. For example, the organization's chief operating officer may automatically assume command for a hospital-wide emergency; by contrast, the Chief of Engineering may assume command for responding to a broken pipe that floods the hospital's data center. Regardless of whether the Incident Commander is in the institution's organization chart, she is responsible for the response until relieved or the emergency ends.\n\n1. Does the institution's emergency plan call for the implementation of an ICS or HEICS system? 2. If it is an ICS system, are all the potential individuals who may declare a disaster and assume command aware of their potential authority? a. Are they trained in the emergency management plan? b. Do they understand how they may be relieved of responsibility? 3. If an institution uses a HEICS system, are the individuals who may assume command as a result of their roles within the organization aware of their roles and their responsibilities in an emergency? Could the designation of the Incident Commander change, based on the nature of an emergency? 4. If the organization uses a HEICS structure (or other modified ICS structure that preassigns individuals to roles in the incident command structure), is the structure regularly reviewed when individuals leave (and new individuals join) the organization, and are the assignments updated as needed? 5. Under either an ICS or HEICS of system: a. Does the relevant individual know the location of the Command Center and the potential resources in it; b. Is that individual familiar with the institution's resources to enable her to gather and assign resources as necessary; and c. Does some kind of chart exist that may be populated with names and contacts in order to keep track of the people who are filling the other roles within the command structure?\n\nThe Liaison Officer communicates with external agencies on behalf of the Incident Commander. 17\n\n1. Has the organization identified those external agencies (e.g., fire, rescue, police, and public health authorities) with which it will need to interact in the event of an emergency? 2. Has the organization compiled contact information for each external agency, and is that contact information available in the Command Center? Is it reviewed on a periodic basis before an emergency occurs to ensure that it is current?\n\n3. Does the contact information include as many different means of communication (e.g., cell telephone, fax, land-line telephone, radio contact information) as possible?\n\n4. Is the Command Center itself set up to be able to use any and all available means of communication? 5. In planning for an emergency, has the organization established appropriate lines of communication with local response agencies, and has 17 Glossary of Terms, supra note 11, at 12. 18 Field Operations Guide, supra note 13, at 5-3. it discussed and coordinated the facility's plans with relevant agencies ahead of time?\n\nThe PIO serves as the contact for media inquiries, and coordinates communication between the organization and the public. 18 8. Has the organization communicated its essential role in emergency response to the community and its political representatives alike, so that the survival of the facility will be a priority consideration that the community and government will take into account after the disaster? 9. Has the organization communicated to donors and other supporters of the organization the essential role that is played by the facility in community emergency response?\n\nThe 1. How will the organization determine what information should be conveyed to others? Will every-one receive the same information, or will some receive less information than others? 2. How will the organization accommodate staff's desire and need to know about an emergency event from the standpoint of the safety of family members, while ensuring continued staff availability for patients? 3. In the event that external authorities issue orders or assume direction of the organization's response, how will those developments be communicated? 4. Has the organization prepared \"template\" messages, and made them available in the Command Center, for use in the event of an emergency, to reduce the time needed to distribute messages to staff? 5. How and to whom will any orders to evacuate any portion of the facility, or to terminate services, be communicated? 6. Are all means of communication tested on a periodic basis to ensure readiness for use during an emergency event?\n\n7. Has the organization established, and is the Command Center capable of issuing, multiple alternative means of communication, including telephone calls, overhead announcements, e-mail, intranet and Internet Web postings, meetings, correspondence, handwritten postings, and \"runners\" assigned to courier handwritten messages? 8. Does the Command Center include contact information for key internal personnel, including individuals who may be away from the facility when an emergency is declared?\n\nSafety and security are essential to incidentresponse activities. Panic and \"mob action\" easily can over-whelm an organization unless order is maintained; further, unsafe conditions may put additional lives in jeopardy. \n\nThe Recorder/Transcriber maintains records of any actions taken as directed by the Incident Commander, as well as any significant event that may occur during the crisis. The Recorder/Transcriber assures continuous flow of and access to information for Command Center staff.\n\n1. Has the organization provided for a recorder/transcriber in the event of an emergency? 2. How will the records of any incident response be used during debriefing to inform the organization's planning for future readiness?\n\nThe Operations Section Chief reports directly to the Incident Commander, and has responsibility for conducting operations during the emergency. 19 The Operations Section Chief is responsible for whatever services are being provided during the emergency, and frequently oversees a fairly large number of operational leaders responsible for specific areas, such as Decontamination, Emergency Services, Inpatient Services, and the Operating Room. 20 Some key issues facing the Operations Section Chief include the following.\n\nGovernment authorities may exercise police powers in an emergency situation, including the isolation of infected individuals and quarantine of healthy individuals who may have been exposed to an infectious agent. For a disease listed in federal Executive Order 13295 as communicable and quarantinable, the U.S. government has jurisdiction to apprehend, detain, and conditionally release individuals to stop its interstate spread or international importation, and need not wait for an interstate spread actually to occur before acting. 21 Thus, it is important for healthcare providers to coordinate isolation and quarantine measures with federal, state, and local authorities.\n\n1. What are the local, regional, state, and national plans for handling a sudden influx of patients who may require decontamination as a result of having been exposed to chemical, biological, or radiological agents? 2. Does the Incident Commander have the authority to implement decontamination, isolation, or quarantine measures? If not, who does? Who needs to be informed in the event that such measures are implemented? 3. Has the organization engaged in isolation or quarantine planning with local and regional public health officials in order to understand what will be expected or demanded if isolation or quarantine is ordered?\n\n4. Is the organization familiar with the plans of all such authorities, and has it coordinated its emergency planning with these authorities?\n\n5. Do procedures exist to identify incoming patients who may require decontamination or isolation? Are staff members trained in them, and is appropriate equipment available to conduct such procedures? How is the safety of staff ensured in the event that a patient requires decontamination or isolation?\n\n6. What plans exist for placing, observing, and caring for individuals subject to isolation or quarantine? Do local officials plan to utilize hospitals or other private facilities for these purposes in an emergency?\n\n7. What legal procedures are required to implement isolation or quarantine of individuals or groups?\n\n8. If a patient is admitted to a hospital, how will isolation and quarantine orders be delivered to the patient during her stay? What constitutes valid orders for isolation or quarantine? Does the organization have a system for receiving and recording any such orders?\n\n9. Is the organization at risk if it implements an isolation or quarantine order issued without a court hearing?\n\n10. Are a court hearing and court order required for the imposition of isolation or quarantine measures? Is an order that is issued without a hearing valid?\n\n11. If a hearing is necessary for a hospital patient who is subject to an isolation or quarantine order, how will the hearing be conducted?\n\n12. Can local, regional, or state agencies provide either legal indemnification or an opinion of counsel regarding the liability of healthcare providers for cooperating with isolation or quarantine orders?\n\n13. How will facilities be compensated for their additional expenses incurred and revenue lost if they are designated as isolation or quarantine facilities? What documentation will be required to make claims for expenses and lost revenues relating to an isolation or quarantine event? 14. Following an isolation or quarantine event, what entity will compensate facilities for their costs of recovery, and what will be the basis for such compensation? What documentation will be required to make claims for these costs of recovery? 15. Who, if anyone, is financially responsible for lost wages due to an order of quarantine or isolation? Who is responsible for compensating a healthcare worker who is sent home by her employer following an exposure? In what way does the answer to this question change if the person is ordered into home quarantine by public health authorities? How does the answer change if the person experienced exposure in a work environment, rather than in a home environment or while traveling abroad? 16. Is it possible for facilities to employ workplace-quarantine measures? Can an employee be quarantined at home outside of working hours (i.e., permitted to leave the home only to go to work)?\n\n17. Who is financially responsible for the costs of isolation or quarantine in a hospital that occurs pursuant to a public health order? What is the response going to be if a thirdparty payor determines that care for a particular illness is not covered, or is no longer medically necessary, and refuses to pay? 18. Who is responsible for enforcing isolation and quarantine orders? (For example, if a patient must be physically detained in isolation, who will ensure the patient stays there?)\n\nIn an emergency, the normal flow of patients to and among healthcare providers almost certainly will be interrupted. See Appendix A for a discussion of the applicability of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) 22 in the event of a major public health emergency.\n\n1. How will the determination be made that the organization's emergency-response plan (or the community emergency-response plan) should be implemented (e.g., whether an official declaration is necessary)? Has a threshold number of cases been established to require the triggering of the plan? What occurs if the plan appears to conflict with an organization's own legal or other obligations? What happens if the community has not developed an emergencyresponse plan? Does the institution have its own plan?\n\n2. Does the organization have in place a full range of transfer agreements to provide for the emergency transfer of patients whose medical conditions are beyond the scope of its services? If the organization is a tertiary care facility, does it have in place transfer agreements with other community providers under which the tertiary care facility will receive patients in an emergency? 3. Do the organization's transfer agreements with any long term care facilities address the immediate return of hospitalized residents in the event of an emergency situation requiring an evacuation of patients?\n\n4. Do the organization's routine files, as well as its Command Center records, include (in readily accessible locations) the list of such community and affiliate resources, including a description of the potential resources and appropriate contact information, for easy reference by the incident-command staff in an emergency? 5. Has the organization planned for partial or complete closure (including partial or complete evacuation) of the facility in the event of an emergency? 6. Does the organization have an established protocol for closure of the facility to 22 12. What is the institution's threshold response in such situations (e.g., any initial evaluation provided; immediate diversion to designated facility; patients presenting with symptoms covered by emergency-response situation, as well as other symptoms)? 13. Can medical-screening exam procedures be altered due to concerns over contamination (e.g., performed outside)?\n\n14. Will response differ by acuity of circumstances (e.g., mass disaster vs. intermittent flow of affected patients)? 15. How will EMTALA compliance be demonstrated and/or documented in the event that an emergency-response plan is implemented?\n\n16. Does the organization have a contingency plan if a potentially exposed patient presents, but the case must first be evaluated by law enforcement or public health? Does this constitute an \"undue delay\" under EMTALA? 17. What is facility's obligation, if a patient is diverted elsewhere, to ensure that patient transfer is effectuated? 18. Have state or local authorities made declarations that will protect the organization in circumstances where an emergency is not \"national,\" and therefore does not trigger protection from sanctions in the regulations? 19. If the facility in question is the designated treatment facility, how are existing patients handled? What happens once capacity is reached? Does the designated facility have a memorandum of understanding (MOU) or mutual-aid agreement with other facilities, or with state or local government? 20. Has there been a presidential declaration of emergency that suspends EMTALA obligations? Will some or all EMTALA obligations be suspended or waived in the event of a local emergency in the absence of a federal or local declaration? 23 23 To date, CMS has not stated this explicitly, but it is important to note that policy in this area is evolving.\n\nIn a mass-casualty event, organizations may be over-whelmed with a sudden influx of patients. It is essential for facilities to both track and be able to report on these patients. \n\nEach state has its own requirements for reporting communicable diseases and conditions to either local or state health departments who, in turn, report information to the CDC. Some local jurisdictions also may have communicable-disease reporting requirements. The time and manner of reporting likely will vary among jurisdictions and among diseases. Some state laws on communicable-disease reporting may bestow immunity on some individuals making such reports. \n\nIn addition to their role as providers of healthcare services, healthcare institutions also are employers. In this context, healthcare institutions must comply with myriad state and federal laws. In the event of an emergency, institutional personnel of all varieties will be called upon to perform various functions, both within and outside of their typical scope of duties. Preparing for and dealing with the aftermath of a crisis will involve an array of duties not only to the public and individual patients, but to the institution's employees as well. Although the laws and regulations discussed in this section apply specifically to the employment relationship between healthcare institutions and their employees, it is important to note that some providers and other personnel work as independent contractors rather than as employees. Institutions should consider the effects of independent-contractor status with respect to the ability to use certain personnel in the event of an emergency, particularly if such individuals have relationships with more than one institution. Moreover, public-sector healthcare institutions also must bear in mind liability issues that might arise under various civil-rights statutes. 25 1. General Considerations. In developing an emergency management plan, organizations should consider the following personnelrelated issues. a. Have the institution's employees received materials and training on the development of personal emergency plans for themselves and their families? Do employees' families understand that, in an emergency, their personal emergency plans may need to be initiated without the employees (or with them only calling into a designated contact), as they may be required to stay at the facility and assist in the facility's response? Do they have enough information about family emergency plans to feel confident that their family will be safe during the emergency so they can focus on their responsibilities? b. Has the institution identified multiple safe staging areas for groups of employees, outside of the primary emergency-response areas, so that they can be assigned as needed? Have the locations of the staging areas been communicated to employees? c. Does the institution have a mechanism that ensures that employees are only released to return home if they are not needed, and if the institution believes that the employee may safely leave the premises? Has the institution developed mechanisms that will enable it to learn of unsafe conditions that would interfere with employees and others 25 See generally 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2004) . exiting the institution (e.g., closed roads, bridges, and mass-transit problems)? d. Has the institution made provision for emergency emotional, spiritual, psychological, and potentially psychiatric support to its employees who are dealing with the personal effects of the emergency? Does it have a plan to employ a triage or other mechanism in such a situation? e. Has the institution anticipated providing some long-term, post-response support to its employees in the event of a major disaster? Does it have the internal resources to do so, or would it need to go to another organization or agency? If it needs to go elsewhere, does it know where to go? f. If an independent contractor has any of its employees performing responsibilities onsite at the institution, has that contractor set up a mechanism to locate and safeguard its employees? Do such employees have a central place to gather and sign in? g. Does the institution know who the independent-contractor employees are, and where they would gather in an emergency in case it needs to call upon their expertise (e.g., a contractor providing routine onsite staffing and management for an institution's data center)? Does the institution know who to contact at the independent contractor's office to get those individuals resourced appropriately in an emergency? h. e. Does a \"no-fault\" compensation program apply? f. Has the organization identified the availability of workers' compensation and/or other forms of financial support for persons unable to return to work because of an isolation/quarantine order? g. How will the organization address any potential legal liability for implementing \"working\" quarantine policies for essential service personnel? h. If an employee is quarantined, but is asymptomatic, is the employee entitled to compensation for the time spent in quarantine? i. Is the institution prepared for workers'compensation claims, which may be filed months or years after the actual emergency event, claiming that the event and the event response negatively affected employees' physical or psychological health?\n\nSimilar to other employers, healthcare institutions are subject to federal regulations that pertain to employee compensation and hours. 26 In addition, organizations must comply with specific labor, compensation, and general employment laws relating to healthcare workers. For example, some states have enacted measures banning mandatory overtime for nurses and other healthcare professionals. 27 Meeting these obligations could present a significant challenge in the face of a major public health emergency, involving a redefinition of the work day, work week, and/or overtime. Some states are considering mandating the continuation of wages if employees are kept from work due to isolation or quarantine (policies that might be considered akin to jury duty). Such measures might enhance compliance by reducing individuals' fears of lost income, and also afford protection for the rest of the workforce. a. Would discharging an employee who is absent because she is subject to quarantine be deemed illegal as a public-policy violation? b. What is the outcome if extended hours required of healthcare workers run up against legal limits on the hours that physicians and nurses can work consecutively? c. Will payment be provided for temporary lodging, meals, or other incidental expenses? d. How will payroll and benefits be maintained? 4. Credentialing Issues, Including Disaster Privileges. Issues may arise regarding whether a hospital or healthcare entity may allow outside medical personnel to assist regular staff during an emergency due to existing medicalprivileges requirements. JCAHO requires hospitals to establish a procedure for verifying credentials and granting privileges during and after a disaster, 28 and has established procedures for doing so. In addition, at the federal level, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services is required to establish a system for advance registration of health professionals to provide for verification of credentials, licenses, accreditations, and hospital privileges when such professionals volunteer during a public health emergency. 29 a. Has the appropriate state or local jurisdiction adopted regulations regarding the use of disaster privileges during an emergency situation? Do such regulations provide immunity for granting or denying such disaster privileges, or for providing care after being granted such privileges? Officers or employees of a party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be considered agents of the requesting state for tort liability and immunity purposes; and no party state or its officers or employees rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be liable on account of any act or omission in good faith on the part of such forces while so engaged or on account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in connection therewith. Good faith in this article shall not include willful misconduct, gross negligence, or gross recklessness. \n\nAs part of their emergency-management planning, organizations should evaluate the implications of the following laws and regulations. condition\" is defined as an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves inpatient care or continuing treatment by a healthcare provider. 37 Some states have analogous provisions, some of which are more generous than the federal law. a. Does FMLA cover an employee who is an asymptomatic patient subject to quarantine or isolation? b. Does FMLA cover an employee's family member who is an asymptomatic patient subject to quarantine or isolation? c. Would a major emergency requiring the participation of all available personnel potentially excuse noncompliance with FMLA, except for those employees with absolute medical needs? 3. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). 38 The ADA creates a variety of duties applicable to employers with regard to disabled employees. It prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities who are otherwise qualified for a job, and it limits pre-employment inquiries. A \"disability\" is defined as \"a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual.\" 39 The ADA applies to employers with fifteen or more employees, and is enforced by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). 40 Healthcare organizations and others must consider the following issues in an emergency, given the nature of an institution's physically impaired employees for whom it might previously have provided an ADA accommodation.\n\na. Do the individuals need any special considerations in ensuring that they: \u2022 Are located properly at the beginning of an emergency; \u2022 Can go to (or be brought to) a staging area for contribution to the response; \u2022 Contribute to the response, and not somehow get in the way of it; and \u2022 Can safely return to their offices (and responsibilities), and/or home, after the response? b. Would it constitute disability discrimination to fire an employee kept out of work due to quarantine or isolation? Does such a decision depend on the employee's disease condition? c. Do any of the organization's employees have a disability that will require special assistance in the event of an evacuation? Is the organization's evacuation plan consistent with the needs and special requirements of each of its employees and medical staff members? d. An employer may reject a job applicant with a disability, or terminate an employee with a disability, for safety reasons if the person poses a direct threat (i.e., a significant risk of substantial harm to self or others) without violating the ADA. This might cover an adverse-employment decision with regard to an employee subject to isolation or quarantine due to exposure and the risk of infection. Could a bona fide emergency convert an accommodation that normally is a reasonable one into an undue hardship? e. What should be the organization's response where employee absenteeism mounts due to the stress of a particular emergency situation, and employees claim that they are suffering from post-traumatic 41 National Labor Relations Act, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 \u00a7 151-169 (2004 \n\nThe Planning Section Chief anticipates the course of events over the relevant time horizon, and makes plans to ensure continued smooth operation of the facility. 44 At the initiation of an emergency, the Planning Section Chief assesses staffing needs, calls in off-duty staff, arranges for transportation of those who need it, establishes a labor pool, and other related tasks. Once a longer period becomes the relevant planning horizon, the Planning Section Chief shifts from a focus on the \"next several hours\" to an emphasis on \"the next several days\" as emergency operations commence and stabilize. Eventually, the Planning Section Chief prepares for the demobilization or \"standing down\" of the organization from the emergency. But planning activities go well beyond the activities of a Section Chief during an emergency. Planning is the heart of good emergency response, and it is found in all activities engaged in by the organization for its daily operations. Emergency planning weds the knowledge that an emergency will occur with the routine management activities the institution conducts.\n\nIt is important that an appropriate chain of succession is established in the event that key players are unavailable during an emergency situation. \n\nplan and other documents how an incident commander is identified? Is the incident commander's authority with respect to the administrative commander (e.g., the CEO) identified in the documentation, and understood by those who might assume incident command and/or maintain administrative authority over the institution? 5. Has the organization's board of directors ratified the chain of command, and is documentation to that effect on file in the Command Center? 6. Are senior leaders trained in their expected emergency-response roles, as well as in alternative roles they may be expected or required to assume during an event?\n\n7. Has the organization drilled for the activation of the Command Center during evening, night, and weekend shifts? 8. Have specific departments drilled in their potential responsibilities? In addition to emergency department drills, has the seniormanagement team drilled together? Have other departments (e.g., finance, human resources) been included in the drills?\n\nIt is important for each organization to conduct a Hazard Vulnerability Analysis (HVA). In an HVA, the organization identifies the foreseeable risks it faces, classifies them as \"high\" or \"low\" likelihood, and assesses their potential effect on the organization. What results is a prioritization of emergencies to plan for, enabling the organization to devote its attention to the high-likelihood, high-effect risks.\n\n1. Who is charged with the preparation of the HVA (e.g., a member of senior management, the facilities department, a committee)? 2. If the charged individual is not a member of senior management, have members of the senior management team provided their input?\n\n3. Where is the HVA located? Has a copy been included in the institution's emergencymanagement manual?\n\n4. Does the organization's senior management understand the major issues identified as part of the analysis, and do these issues inform the facility's documentation and contracting processes?\n\n5. Does the HVA include the possibility of responding to terrorism and the so-called \"CNBC\" (i.e., concussive, nuclear, biological, and chemical) events, as well as the differing effects each might have on the ability of the facility to respond?\n\n6. Is the organization located in a potential terrorist target area? If so, does the organization need to stockpile certain mission-critical supplies, and is it keeping track of its incurred expenses in doing so?\n\n7. Does the HVA and the institution's other emergency plans contemplate whether and how the emergency could limit access to (and from) the institution for patients, employees, and vendors? a. Are critical roads and transit points subject to their own risks (e.g., earthquakes), or are they targets for terrorist attacks? b. Do such ingress/egress thoroughfares run by locations that may need to limit their own access in an emergency and beyond (e.g., past police headquarters or governmental buildings)? c. Does the organization understand how long a threatened closure may last (e.g., during the emergency; during the cleanup; permanently)? d. Based on the length of possible closure, how might the closure affect both the response to the emergency and the eventual recovery from it? 8. Have the institution's vendors been apprised of the possible limitations of access to the facility, and can they contribute to any necessary work-around strategy to ensure the delivery of supplies and equipment to the facility?\n\nHealthcare providers often are parties to myriad community-support, affiliation, or transfer agreements. Such agreements can be a source of support during a crisis situation.\n\n1. Does the facility participate in community or industry organizations that may provide support, or to which the facility may need to contribute, during an emergency in the community? Is the contact information for these organizations readily accessible to the Command Center?\n\n2. Is the facility part of a larger healthcare system upon whose resources it can call (or to whose resources the facility may need to contribute) in an emergency? a. Are such potential emergency contributions (i.e., resources of system members to other system members) described in any document or other agreement? For instance, in an emergency, will other facilities assist the organization by sending staff, supplies, and/or equipment? b. If the facility generally is a stand-alone facility, can agreements be implemented with other community providers (perhaps even with potential competitors) for emergency assistance? c. How will these contributions be compensated?\n\n3. Is the institution part of a regional association that can coordinate resources and response among facilities? a. Will the communication lines with any such association be clear, even in an emergency? b. Is the institution confident that the association will address the institution's unique concerns relating to its patient population, location, and available resources?\n\n4. Does the organization have mutual-assistance pacts with other facilities that may be able to supply needed personnel, supplies, or equipment? Are such mutual-assistance agreements specific to the organization (e.g., does a pediatric hospital have access to pediatric ventilators in an emergency)?\n\nThe institution's mission-critical 45 vendor agreements should provide for the vendor's assistance in planning for and responding to an emergency.\n\n1. As part of the contracting process, has the institution discussed with its potential vendors the outcome of its HVA? 2. Is the vendor aware of the potential risks that are of particular concern to the institution? 3. Have contract discussions addressed any expectations between the parties about vendor response and/or assistance in an emergency?\n\n4. Has the organization sought and included input from the vendor(s) in developing the institution's disaster-recovery plans? 5. Does the institution have the leverage to demand a priority response in an emergency? Should it attempt to negotiate such a priority anyway? 6. Have any expectations been discussed with respect to compensation for additional emergency services and/or goods? (The parties may decide legitimately to leave the agreement silent on this point, or may go into depth about this issue.) 7. Does the vendor understand that the institution expects that the vendor will show up in an emergency and that the parties will discuss the compensation after the disaster, but that the consideration will not reflect a mark-up in the negotiated consideration purely because of the emergency? a. Could access to the institution be interrupted, disrupting the flow of services and/or goods to the institution in a disaster? 45 Mission-critical items are not limited to clinical issues such as medical supplies. Mission-critical items may include food-service agreements, software agreements for billing applications, and other items important to the organization's operation.\n\nb. Will the institution have access to alternative suppliers of services and/or goods (e.g., food)? 8. Is the contract clear that a disaster at the institution's location will not necessarily relieve the vendor of its obligations?\n\n9. Does a disaster experienced by the vendor at its location relieve the vendor of all contractual obligations, or would it instead trigger the vendor's obligation to implement its own disaster-recovery plan in addition to the disaster-recovery plan of the institution? 10. If a disaster interferes with the provision of the underlying services for a certain period of time (e.g., notwithstanding an involved disasterrecovery plan, the institution's software applications are unable to process its data for thirty days after the disaster), may the institution terminate the underlying agreement?\n\nDocumentation of a healthcare institution's operational, financial, and administrative activities is important for many purposes. Nevertheless, documentation in patient charts, for example, may be less complete than usual when providers are responding to an emergency situation. This may pose a legal vulnerability for healthcare providers.\n\nDuring an emergency situation, documentation also may be particularly important for insurancereimbursement and grant purposes if grants are made available based on what was done (and adequately documented) during the emergency. If documentation is insufficient, then an organization can lose track of patients, symptoms and diagnoses, and loved ones because the organization is not following its usual systems.\n\n1. Is a triage tagging system in place that determines the triage classification of each person who is evaluated and treated in the emergency department?\n\n2. Does the organization have a system of documentation sufficient for tracking of patients and communication with healthcare providers?\n\n3. Is the documentation in the chart sufficient to demonstrate that the standard of care was met, as well as to enable continuity of care?\n\n4. If the institution relies on a computer registration system that may be unavailable during portions of an emergency event, can the institution print out blank screens (i.e., template information-entry screens providing the prompts for information that can be manually recorded on hard-copy) prior to or during the emergency, so that demographic, insurance, and other information elements usually captured by the computer system electronically can still be captured (if only by hand) and then backloaded into the computer system once the crisis has passed? Similarly, if the organization's information technology (IT) system fails temporarily, is a process in place to document critical entries in a patient's medical record by hand, and ultimately to transfer them to the electronic system when it is again functional?\n\n5. Does the system of the documentation in place during emergencies meet requirements for insurance reimbursement, subsequent loans, funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), payor funding, and/or other emergency funding?\n\n6. Is the documentation sufficient to comply with reporting obligations to licensing agencies?\n\n7. How will the organization's payroll records accurately capture the significant overtime provided in an emergency?\n\n8. Are any supplies that are given out to the community or government authorities appropriately documented for subsequent reimbursement?\n\n9. Do any state-statutory immunity provisions apply to recordkeeping during an emergency? \n\nIt is important for a healthcare organization to assess any potential vulnerabilities with its physical plant and facilities, as well as to take appropriate measures to ensure the continuation of utilities, IT systems, communications, and other services necessary to maintain its operations.\n\n1. If an IT system is judged to be mission-critical, is it on the electrical backup systems? Are the computers that need to access the system also on the backup systems? 2. What are the institution's emergency power capabilities? Are there any issues in accessing the emergency power if a mass blackout is caused for any reason? 3. Can the institution access portable generators? Might the placement of a portable emergency generator cause any street and/or zoning issues? Have the organization's personnel been trained in the proper operation of emergency generators? 4. Has the organization assessed potential vulnerabilities relating to the physical location of individual departments (e.g., placement of a data center in a basement location that may be subject to flooding)?\n\nWhen designing an emergency-preparedness plan for a healthcare institution, it is likely that questions or concerns will be raised regarding the potential civil liability of healthcare entities or personnel who respond to an emergency. It is possible that state-statutory immunity provisions may apply to such situations. Immunity provisions may be found in state \"Good Samaritan,\" emergency-management, or other statutes.\n\n1. Does the appropriate jurisdiction(s) provide exemption from civil liability for emergency care as provided in a Good Samaritan act, emergency-management laws, or other statutes? 2. Has the organization's medical staff and allied health practitioners been apprised of the applicable statutes, and of their liabilities and immunities during an emergency situation?\n\nThe Logistics Section Chief arranges for the needed support to operations, including delivery of food and other supplies; assessment and safe use of the facility, if in question (e.g., following an earthquake or explosion); and equipping of rooms and alternate-care sites if evacuation or relocation becomes necessary. 46\n\nIn an emergency situation, some staff will need to remain on duty in order to maintain the continued functioning of the organization and provide patient care, while others may need to be released or evacuated. Plans should be in place to mobilize needed personnel while effectively moving non-essential staff away from the institution.\n\n1. Who is responsible for notification of an emergency situation to the organization's employees and members of its medical staff? How is such notification carried out? 2. Are staging areas assigned for specific groups of employees?\n\n3. Do the relevant employees know where those staging areas are? 4. How are the staging areas for off-campus locations (e.g., clinics, physicians, and back offices) coordinated? 46 Field Operations Guide, supra note 13, at 9-3.\n\n5. How will the institution ensure that adequate personnel will be deployed, but not so many that the institution becomes overrun dealing with personnel instead of patients? 6. How is the information about available personnel at these off-campus locations communicated to the Incident Commander? 7. What occurs if one of the off-campus locations has its own demand for additional personnel to respond to the crisis? Does the institution's management plan contemplate a response from multiple locations? 8. Have issues of food and rest been contemplated in choosing the staging areas? 9. Is the institution prepared to provide places of rest for employees who are unable to return home (e.g., cots, physician examination tables, unoccupied beds and administrative offices, local motel rooms)?\n\n10. Are these places of rest separate from patientcare areas? 11. If employees will need to overstay their shift, is adequate food available onsite to feed them? If not, will the facility's usual food suppliers be able to access the institution in an emergency, or will the hospital need to seek alternate suppliers (e.g., local restaurant(s))? 12. How will the institution handle employees' need to contact their families? 13. Do the employees have family emergency plans in place? 14. How will the institution handle employees who need/demand to leave in order to safeguard their own families? 15. What occurs if certain employees demand to leave, but it may be unsafe to do so? How will the institution obtain information about the surrounding streets? How will it convey that information to its employees? 16. How will adequate staffing during the crisis be ensured? Does the organization have an emergency-or contingency-staffing plan in the event that personnel either are unable or unwilling to report to work? Is the organization aware of state-specific laws and regulations affecting personnel overtime or extended shifts? 47\n\n17. How will the institution communicate to those of its employees who were not at the facility at the start of the crisis that they should/should not try to report to the facility? 18. How will the institution handle bringing personnel to the facility if the usual means of access is interfered with by the event (e.g., a blizzard or flood)? 19. How will the organization ensure the availability of contract or leased healthcare practitioners (who may have relationships with other institutions) during the emergency situation? Does the independent-contractor or employee-leasing agreement(s) contemplate alternative-staffing arrangements in the event of an emergency? Do such agreements clearly delineate what duties the organization can require of contracted or leased employees during an emergency situation? 20. How will documentation of employee and contract healthcare practitioner overtime be documented, and how will such personnel records be protected? 21. How will the institution account for an employee who could not get to work and/or was not needed to respond (e.g., will the time away from the individual count as paid time off, or will her wages be docked)? What labor agreements may influence the thinking around this issue, and what do they say about it? 22. How will the institution demobilize its employees from their response? 23. Will some or all employees need to be debriefed in the aftermath of the emergency event? 24. Is an evacuation plan in place? Does the evacuation plan involve movement to particular sites? What assumption of liability does the institution assume when effecting such an evacuation?\n\nAn organization's agreements relating to IT infrastructure and software applications should take into account emergency-response needs.\n\n1. Do the institution's software licenses specifically authorize the regular backup of relevant software and the data, as well as the loading of the software in test, backup, and disasterrecovery environments to protect the applications and data? 2. What, if any, redundancy is built into the institution's IT infrastructure? 3. Has the choice of the location of the institution's data center taken into account issues such as the age of the building's underlying infrastructure, access to emergency generator power, access to air conditioning, and related concerns, as well as the critically of the applications to be run out of the center? 4. Will the IT emergency plan be effective in a \"minor\" disaster (e.g., a cut power line or datacenter flood) that is not primarily or initially an institution-wide issue? 5. Does the institution have in place disasterrecovery sites and plans for its software applications? a. Are its software applications and data backed up on a regular basis?\n\nb. If the organization's software applications generally are run on-site, is its disasterrecovery site located off-site (or vice versa)? c. Have the advantages and disadvantages of the locations of the organization's primary software-operations and disaster-recovery sites been taken into account in the various contracting processes? d. If the institution's software applications are run in a Web-based or remotecomputing mode, is the vendor's disasterrecovery plan accessible to the institution, and has the institution reviewed that plan? e. Based upon the review of the remote vendor's disaster plan, is it necessary for the organization to separately contract for a disaster-recovery site for that application, or can the primary agreement be considered to include a disaster-recovery component? f. If the institution is relying upon the disaster-recovery plans of the remote vendor, will the institution be notified of any changes to that plan? g. Does the institution have the negotiating leverage necessary to require its consent to any changes in the vendor's disasterrecovery plan? Does the institution have the expertise to exercise effectively its consent over a remote vendor's disaster-recovery plan, or is it better to rely on the vendor's expertise in the particular instance?\n\nIn preparing for emergencies, an organization's goal should be to maintain continuity of critical IT services during and following the emergency, and to have in place a disaster-recovery plan that allows IT services to be re-established as quickly as possible. \n\nA specific element for consideration in relation to the facility's emergency IT planning is how to maintain Internet Service Provider (ISP) service during and following an emergency.\n\n1. Does the facility maintain two separate ISP relationships in the event that one ISP fails? Does the organization prefer to have the second ISP arranged as a back-up service (in which case it will only be activated if the primary ISP fails), or does the facility wish to maintain two fully functioning ISPs at all times?\n\n2. Does the organization maintain a servicelevel agreement with its ISP provider(s) that guarantees immediate service if the facility experiences problems with the ISP? Does the agreement include a provision specifying the service that the organization expects to receive during and following an emergency?\n\nThe organization will need to decide whether to maintain a \"hot site\" for some or all IT services (either directly or through an IT vendor). A hot site is a physical location to which the facility can move its data operations and communications in the event of an emergency. The hot site will be configured to the facility's specifications, with computers, printers, Internet services, and work stations for staff. The hot site maintains the same data as is maintained at the facility, either through regular backups or through real-time synchronization. In case of an emergency, a hot site will allow the facility to restore operations within hours or days, depending on the level of service purchased. A cold site, by contrast, generally does not allow for immediate restoration of data operations and communications. A cold site usually consists of pre-arranged contracts for the lease of computers, equipment, and space in an emergency, as well as off-site storage of data tapes. Although a cold site is a less expensive option, it will take more time for that site to become fully operational. The choice of whether to maintain a hot site, cold site, or some combination of the two, will depend on the facility's need to immediately restore data operations and communications in an emergency. Conducting a business analysis or HVA can help determine the facility's capacity to handle \"downtime\" in its data operations and communications, and guide the selection of backup services and facilities.\n\n1. For how long can the facility afford to be without its IT services?\n\n2. How serious is the effect of having the facility's IT services unavailable? 3. Has the facility conducted a business analysis regarding the effects of losing its IT services, or is loss of IT services included in the HVA? 4. How much is the facility willing to spend to ensure that the continuity of IT services is maintained (e.g., on a real-time basis; on a delayed-response basis)? 5. Does the facility's IT vendor(s) maintain hot or cold sites that will be used to protect the facility's IT services?\n\n6. Would it be less expensive to contract with an IT vendor to provide the facility with hot site or cold site backup, as opposed to contracting for the backup system directly?\n\nThe Finance Section Chief makes arrangements to ensure the organization's continued financial health, from recording the cost of emergency response to arranging credit for needed supplies and coordinating financial arrangements for emergency operations, such as costs associated with relocating patients from an evacuated building. \n\nThis Checklist should provide legal counsel with the necessary tools to assist healthcare providers in preparing for an emergency, and in facilitating the return of the organization from emergency operations to normal status as quickly as possible. The Planning Section Chief will spend considerable time planning for the transition back to routine activities, including demobilization of any additional resources implemented during the crisis. This recovery constitutes the fourth and final stage of emergency preparedness. The Recovery phase includes: implementing any necessary repairs; granting furloughs to staff who responded to the emergency; returning patients to previously closed units; submitting applications for available emergency relief funding; and similar steps. It is important to ensure that the organization has adequate staffing and resources to resume its ongoing operations.\n\nFinally, debriefing from the emergency is an important step to obtain input with regard to \"lessons learned\" for use in the event of future crises. Administrative and clinical personnel alike should participate in debriefing the event, and the information gathered during debriefing, and those gleaned from the records kept in the Command Center, should form the basis for the next round of preparation and mitigation-the first two phases of emergency planning. In this way, successfully concluding the response to (and recovery from) an emergency creates the opportunity for further improvement in readiness in anticipation of the unknown but inevitable next emergency.\n\nRecent events have raised questions regarding whether a provider's obligations under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) 59 might be modified or waived in the event of a major public health emergency. 60 On November 8, 2001, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued an informal policy statement in response to hospitals' inquiries regarding the extent of their EMTALA obligations following the fall 2001 anthrax incidents. 61 Up to that point, administrative and case law involving EMTALA had not contemplated public health emergencies. The statute itself contains no suggestion that its obligations would vary in the face of a community-wide emergency; nevertheless, when such events began to seem more likely, concerns and questions arose. 62 Although it reiterated to some extent the continued application of EMTALA's obligations, the 2001 CMS letter suggested that there was an exception to the stabilization requirement if a community response plan is in place. 63 Moreover, the letter indicated that a hospital's initial screening obligation might be limited if a community-response plan designated certain facilities to handle particular categories of patients in a bioterrorism situation, and if the hospital in question is not such a designated facility. 64 The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 65 articulated a more formal policy regarding EMTALA obligations in an emergency situation. The legislation authorized the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to waive sanctions for EMTALA violations when the violations when the violation comes from an inappropriate transfer of an unstable patient in public health emergency circumstances (as defined by a presidential declaration). This potential limitation on EMTALA obligations during a public health emergency is more circumscribed than what the 2001 CMS letter suggested, as it does not indicate a reduction in the screening obligation (nor does it eliminate private individuals' right of action).\n\nThe final EMTALA rule promulgated on September 9, 2003, 66 also addressed public health emergency situations. Similar to the 2001 CMS letter and the 2002 Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act, this final rule did not answer definitely the question regarding the extent of EMTALA obligations in a crisis situation. The preamble to the rule references the 2001 CMS letter, and notes that the final rule adds a public health emergency provision to the EMTALA regulations. 67 The new provision states that \"sanctions under EMTALA for an inappropriate transfer during a national emergency do not apply to a hospital with a dedicated emergency department located in an emergency area . In the event of such an emergency, CMS would issue appropriate guidance to hospitals.\" 68 CMS Interpretive Guidelines issued to State Survey Agency Directors on May 13, 2004, 69 seemed to restate the position taken in the 2001 CMS letter. Referencing the new regulatory provision implemented with the 2003 final rule, 70 the guidelines state that, in the event of a national emergency or crisis, if state or local governments have implemented communityresponse plans designating certain facilities to handle particular categories of patients, then hospitals in the area that are not designated facilities must still provide a medical screening exam, but may then transfer patients in those categories to a designated facility without triggering EMTALA sanctions. 71 The Project Bioshield Act of 2004, signed into law on July 21 of that year, contains a brief provision relating to EMTALA's screening obligations, allowing the DHHS Secretary to waive standard EMTALA requirements, and allow for \"the direction or relocation of an individual to receive medical screening in an alternate location pursuant to an appropriate State emergency preparedness plan.\" 72 two main sources of protection for the institution in the event of a natural disaster. Property insurance will cover the cost of damage repairs, while business-interruption insurance will cover the loss of business income.\n\nTwo types of business-interruption coverage are available: named perils and all-risk policies. The former provides protection only for specifically named perils, while the latter provides coverage for all perils except those specifically excluded. The two types of insurance generally are purchased as a package, and the same perils will be covered under both policies. It is important to note that two common exceptions to property insurance are earthquake and flood damage.\n\nCoverage for these events typically can be added for additional fees. In fact, in certain areas, flood insurance may even be required. 84 Ensuring adequate insurance coverage is an important means to survival following disaster.\n\nDisaster assistance for businesses is coordinated through the Small Business Administration (SBA). 85 In order to qualify, the business must be in a declared disaster area. 86 Two types of disaster declarations activate SBA disasterassistance efforts: Presidential Declaration and SBA Declaration. 87 A Presidential Declaration is made when damages are significant. In the case of a Presidential Declaration, \"SBA offers physical and economic injury loans in the declared counties and economic injury (EI) loans only in contiguous counties. \u2026If the damages are less extensive the Governor can ask for a SBA declaration.\" 88 Two types of SBA declarations may be made: Physical Disaster Declaration and Economic Injury Declaration. The SBA makes three types of disasterassistance loans to business, 89 and individual assistance is coordinated through FEMA.\n\n1. Physical Disaster Business Loans. These loans cover uninsured physical damages. 90 Any business located in a declared disaster area that incurred damage during the disaster may apply for a loan to help repair or replace damaged property (e.g., real property, machinery, equipment, fixtures, inventory, and leaseholds) to its pre-disaster condition.\n\nLoans. These loans are provided to small businesses located in a declared disaster area that suffer substantial economic injury, regardless of physical damage. 91 \"Small businesses and small agricultural cooperatives that have suffered substantial economic injury resulting from a physical disaster or an agricultural production disaster designated by the Secretary of Agriculture may be eligible for the SBA's Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program. Substantial economic injury is the inability of a business to meet its obligations as they mature and to pay its ordinary and necessary operating expenses.\" 92 3. Pre-Disaster Mitigation Loans. These lowinterest, fixed-rate loans are made to small businesses for mitigation measures to protect business property from damage that may be caused by future disasters. 93 \"A mitigation measure is something done for the purpose of protecting real and personal property against disaster-related damage. Examples of mitigation measures include retaining walls, sea walls, grading and contouring land, elevating flood-prone structures, relocating utilities, and retrofitting structures against high winds, earthquakes, floods, wild-fires, or other disasters.\" 94 The Pre-Disaster Mitigation Loan program is a pilot program designed to support FEMA's Pre-Disaster Mitigation Program. Loans are made available to businesses which propose mitigation measures that conform to the priorities and goals of the community in which the business is located (as defined by FEMA).\n\nAssistance. 95 Disaster assistance for individuals is coordinated through FEMA. Individuals apply for most assistance directly through FEMA. To apply for SBA loans, individuals who are homeowners or renters must first register with FEMA to obtain a FEMA Registration ID number. FEMA generally establishes local Disaster Recovery Centers to coordinate assistance. After an application for assistance is received, the damaged property is inspected to verify the loss. 96 The deadline for most individual-assistance programs is sixty days following the president's declaration of a"}
