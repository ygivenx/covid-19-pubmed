{"title": "Community Respiratory Viruses in Individuals with Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection", "body": "progression. Increased HIV-1 replication has been demonstrated in vitro in T lymphoma cells exposed to genetic material from adenovirus. Increased HIV replication in peripheral blood from adults following inactivated influenza vaccination has been reported. The impact of natural respiratory viral infection (and perhaps vaccination against these pathogens) on HIV replication and disease progression will be an important area of study. Am J Med. 1997 R espiratory viral infections are among the most common human illnesses, particularly among young children. However, little is known regarding the impact of these ubiquitous viruses on individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. HIV-infected individuals may have one of several conditions that are associated with increased morbidity and mortality from common respiratory viral infections, including humoral and cellular immunodeficiency, chronic pulmonary disease, and cardiac disease. [1] [2] [3] [4] \n\nThe principal viruses that cause respiratory tract infections and their common clinical presentations in children are listed in Table I . Preschool children can have 5-9 respiratory tract infections per year, the majority of which are caused by these viruses. 5 Virtually all preschool children will contract infections with influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses, and adenoviruses. Rhinoviruses and coronaviruses are also frequent causes of respiratory illness. It is likely that, by adulthood, all individuals will have been infected by virtually all the viruses listed in Table I . [6] [7] [8] [9] In addition, repeated infection with RSV and influenza is very common because of either incomplete immunity resulting from primary infection (i.e., RSV) or antigenic variation of the virus itself (i.e., influenza).\n\nHumoral factors, and particularly serum antibody, are associated with at least partial protection from respiratory viruses in humans. 10, 11 Pre-existing anti- body is associated with attenuated illness, although protection from subsequent re-infection may be incomplete. For example, children can be repeatedly infected with RSV, although subsequent illnesses are usually less severe than the primary infection. 12 Complete recovery from and clearance of these viral infections are likely mediated by virus-specific cellular mechanisms. 13, 14 HIV-infected individuals have deficiencies in both humoral and cellular defenses. Therefore, infection by common respiratory viruses may present differently in this population than in immunocompetent individuals. Since most adults with HIV disease acquired their infection as adults or adolescents, they probably have experienced infections by most of the common respiratory viruses and thus have some preexisting immunity. For this reason, respiratory viral infections may be a greater clinical problem in HIVinfected infants and children, who may not have preexisting immunity to these pathogens. Clearance of respiratory viruses is likely to depend on cellular immune mechanisms, and HIV-infected individuals are at theoretical risk for prolonged infections caused by these viruses.\n\nLittle is known regarding the severity of viral respiratory disease in HIV-infected individuals. It may be anticipated that the immune deficiencies associated with HIV infection may result in more severe illnesses due to respiratory viruses. Immunologic mechanisms, particularly cellular immune responses, are important components of the inflammatory response to respiratory viruses, so predicting illness severity in HIV-infected individuals becomes complicated.\n\nModerate to severe illnesses caused by these viruses in HIV-infected adults and children have been reported. Few prospective cohort or population-based studies are available with which to address their frequency. Also, it must be recognized that severe and even fatal respiratory illnesses can occur in the general population, albeit infrequently.\n\nThere have been several reports of influenza infections in HIV-infected adults and children (Table  II) . In HIV-infected adults, influenza has been associated with lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI), but the clinical presentation was not dramatically different from that seen in the general population. 15, 16 The only evidence to support increased severity of influenza in adults with HIV disease is a report of an increase in pneumonia deaths among persons aged 25-44 (primary adult acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS] group) during the peak influenza months in cities with a high incidence of HIV infection. 17 However, in this report, no direct association between AIDS and deaths from influenza could be made.\n\nThere has been one case report involving a 7-yearold HIV-infected child who had a common clinical presentation, albeit prolonged illness, associated with influenza A infection. 18 A second report involved an HIV-infected child who had a febrile seizure associated with influenza B infection that was otherwise typical. 19 A fatal LRTI was associated with influenza A (H3N2) in an HIV-infected child with preexisting cardiomyopathy. 19 Another HIV-infected infant had a fatal LRTI associated with H3N2 infection; however, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Pneumocystis carinii were also isolated from the lung of this patient. 20\n\nRSV infections in HIV-infected individuals have not been dramatically more severe than those observed in the general population (Table II) RSV infection has been reported more often in HIV-infected children than in HIV-infected adults. In one series of 10 hospitalized HIV-infected children with RSV infection, the mortality rate was 20%. 22 However, the two children who died had bacterial superinfection at the time of death. Of note, few of the HIV-infected children with RSV illness had wheezing, which was frequently present in non-HIVinfected controls hospitalized with RSV. In another report of 16 cases of RSV in HIV-infected children, two deaths were reported: One child was co-infected with CMV and P. carinii, and the other had no other pathogen identified at the time of death. 19 The remaining 14 cases were described as unremarkable. Asymptomatic RSV infection was documented for at least 3 weeks in an HIV-infected child recovering from severe LRTI associated with parainfluenza type 3 and other pathogens. 23 Finally, in a prospective birth cohort study that specifically addressed respiratory viruses, the severity of RSV illness was similar in HIV-and non-HIV-infected children. 24 In this study, no deaths were associated with 10 RSV infections in eight HIV-infected children. However, HIVinfected children with LRTI were more likely to have pneumonia than non-HIV-infected children, who were more likely to have bronchiolitis (wheezing).\n\nThere have been case reports of parainfluenza virus infections in HIV-infected children (Table II) . In one report, parainfluenza type 3 was isolated from two children, one with ''severe respiratory distress'' and the other with pneumonia. 23 Both of these children had coinfections with P. carinii as well as other possible pathogens. In another report, a child had interstitial pneumonia associated with P. carinii and Legionella, as well as parainfluenza type 3. 25 One fatal case of measles giant cell pneumonia was reported in which the child also had CMV and parainfluenza type 3 at the time of illness. 26 Another fatality was associated with P. carinii and coinfection with parainfluenza type 3. 19 In all these reports, it was difficult to attribute severe or fatal illnesses solely to infection by parainfluenza virus.\n\nIn cases involving solely parainfluenza viruses, the illnesses were generally less severe. One case involved parainfluenza type 2 isolated from a 6-yearold HIV-infected child hospitalized with status asthmaticus. 19 In this same review, the author relates three cases of isolated parainfluenza type 3 infections in HIV-infected children: One child was asymptomatic, another presented with wheezing and a lower lobe infiltrate, and a third child had an exacerbation of lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis.\n\nThe most consistently severe cases of respiratory viral infections involved adenovirus infection in HIVinfected individuals (Table II) . One case report described an adult with pneumonia associated with adenovirus type 29 infection that progressed to respiratory failure and death. 27 In a review of 16 patients with fatal disseminated adenovirus infection involving hepatic necrosis, three had HIV infection (two were children), and adenovirus types 1, 2, and 3 were involved in these fatal cases. 28 In another report, an HIV-infected child initially had respiratory distress associated with an adenovirus type 5 infection that progressed to disseminated disease and death. 29 Finally, an untyped adenovirus was isolated from a 6-month-old baby with presumed HIV infection in whom a fatal hemorrhagic illness developed. 19\n\nNo severe illnesses associated with these viruses have been reported.\n\nIn immunocompetent individuals, RSV, influenza viruses, and the parainfluenza viruses result in selflimited infections, with virus shedding often detected for the first 1-2 weeks after infection. 30, 31 Despite relatively few published reports, respiratory viral infections in HIV-infected individuals appear to be prolonged compared with such infection in immunocompetent individuals. Impaired cell-mediated clearance of respiratory viruses from HIV-infected individuals may be responsible for these prolonged infections. Long-term shedding of respiratory viruses has important infection control implications, because HIV-infected individuals frequently visit medical facilities or are admitted to the hospital. In addition, prolonged respiratory viral shedding by HIV-infected individuals may have an impact on nursing homes, day care centers, or group foster homes, where other high-risk individuals may be exposed to these respiratory viruses.\n\nOne series of six HIV-infected adults hospitalized with influenza has been reported. 15 Although viral shedding was not assessed, clinical illness appeared to be prolonged (median duration of fever, 7.5 days) compared with such illness in normal adults. Prolonged shedding of influenza virus has been reported in HIV-infected children. Influenza A (H3N2) was detected for ''at least 3.5 weeks'' in one child, 19 and another report documented influenza A (not subtyped) nasopharyngeal shedding for at least 2 months. 18 The child in the latter report was treated with rimantadine, with temporary disappearance of influenza A. Nasopharyngeal shedding of influenza A virus later recurred in this patient and was detected up to 150 days after the initial infection.\n\nSeveral reports of prolonged RSV shedding in HIVinfected individuals have been published. One HIVinfected adult shed RSV for at least 17 days. 21 In a series of 10 HIV-infected children hospitalized with RSV, three children shed virus for 30, 45, and 90 days, respectively. 22 Two of these long-term RSV shedders were treated with ribavirin (presumably initially), without apparent cessation of shedding. In another report of 16 cases of RSV in HIV-infected children, RSV shedding was detected ''up to 56 days.'' A third report demonstrated RSV shedding for at least 3 weeks. 23 In a prospective cohort study, RSV shedding was prolonged in children with more advanced HIV disease (median, 30 days; range, 1-199 days). In the child who shed RSV for 199 days, neither nebulized ribavirin for 5 days nor 1 g/day of commercial intravenous immunoglobulin (unknown RSV titer) for 5 days was able to eradicate RSV shedding.\n\nProlonged shedding of parainfluenza viruses in HIV-infected children has been reported. In the first report, two children shed parainfluenza type 3 virus for 1 and 3 months, respectively. 23 A second report also documented parainfluenza type 3 virus shedding for 2 and 9 months, respectively. 19 Perhaps the most impressive case of shedding involved an HIV-infected child who shed parainfluenza type 2 virus for ''about a year.'' 19\n\nDiscussing prolonged infection of these viruses is difficult, in that adenoviruses may remain latent in their hosts. No cases of prolonged shedding of adenovirus from the respiratory tract of HIV-infected individuals have been reported.\n\nNo reports of prolonged shedding of these viruses have been found.\n\nIt has been speculated that any antigenic stimulus to the immune system of HIV-infected individuals could activate HIV-1 replication in quiescent T cells. 32, 33 No investigations that assessed HIV replication in individuals with respiratory viral infection have been reported. These infections occur frequently enough to warrant this type of investigation.\n\nSome studies have indirectly addressed the issue of HIV activation by respiratory viruses. Specific genes from adenovirus (and herpes simplex virus) have been identified that activate HIV replication in vitro in T lymphoma cells. 34 Also, there have been reports that vaccination with inactivated influenza vaccine can increase replication of HIV-1 in adults. 35, 36 However, one report did not find any difference in circulating HIV-1 RNA levels in vaccinees compared with controls. 37 Specifically for influenza, it will be important to compare HIV activation in individuals who receive influenza vaccine with HIV activation in those who contract natural influenza infection, so that the risk/benefit ratio of influenza vaccination in individuals with HIV disease can be addressed.\n\nTo date, the severity of respiratory viral illnesses in HIV-infected individuals has not been demon-strated to be dramatically different from that in the population as a whole. The possible exception to this would be adenovirus infection, for which fatal cases predominate in HIV-infected adults and children. Further epidemiologic studies are needed to help define the true frequency of severe respiratory viral disease in HIV-infected individuals.\n\nIt is clear from the literature that prolonged infection and shedding of common respiratory viruses can occur in HIV-infected individuals. Data from one cohort study reveal that, at least for RSV, prolonged shedding occurs quite often. Epidemiologic studies are needed to address these issues. Long-term respiratory viral shedding has important infection control implications, and therapies to interrupt this shedding need to be developed.\n\nFinally, the impact of respiratory viral infections on HIV replication and disease progression, particularly in HIV-infected children, would seem to be an important area of study. As vaccines against respiratory viruses are developed, it will be important to compare their impact on HIV replication with that resulting from natural respiratory viral infection to properly assess their risk/benefit ratio. This is particularly important in light of reports of prolonged respiratory viral infection in HIV-infected individuals."}
