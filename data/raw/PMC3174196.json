{"title": "Recurrent Recruitment Manoeuvres Improve Lung Mechanics and Minimize Lung Injury during Mechanical Ventilation of Healthy Mice", "body": "Mechanical ventilation (MV) of mice is increasingly used in biomedical research. While the mechanisms of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) have been explored intensively [1], experimental conditions required to keep physiological parameters stable in mice during ventilation for several hours are not well defined. Major reasons for this are the focus on the mechanisms of VILI and the lack of comprehensive monitoring of pulmonary and cardiovascular key parameters in most studies.\n\nMonitoring of key physiological parameters is standard during mechanical ventilation of humans and should be aimed also in experimental research. These key parameters need to reflect both the pulmonary (e.g. tidal volume, airway pressure) and the cardiovascular (e.g. heart rate, blood pressure) consequences of MV as well as oxygenation and acid-base status. Although MV may affect all these parameters, these entities have rarely been assessed together in the same study in mice (Table 1). Table 1 summarizes ventilation studies, in which either lung impedance was measured or ventilation was performed for at least four hours. The table reveals that many studies that have focused on lung mechanics examined only a relatively short period of ventilation [2]\u2013[5] and only one study fulfilled both inclusion criteria [6]. Interestingly, studies in which mice were ventilated for more than three hours often provided cardiovascular parameters, but neglected the examination of lung functions [7]\u2013[10]. Some studies even completely lacked physiological parameters, although in several cases the authors referred to preliminary experiments that were not included in the published data [11]\u2013[14]. We believe that, without comprehensive information on physiological parameters, it is difficult to properly assess, standardize and compare the various ventilation strategies.\n\nStudies on the mechanisms of VILI have identified several beneficial ventilation strategies, among them low tidal volume (VT) ventilation and application of recruitment manoeuvres (RM) as well as high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Although RM have a sound physiological basis, it remains unclear how they should be applied [15]. In principal, RM may be used to reopen atelectatic lung areas in injured lungs or to prevent atelectasis in healthy lungs. The latter application requires lower recruitment pressures and hence can be applied more frequently. Without RM, pulmonary compliance is likely to decrease as shown already many years ago in anesthetized dogs both during spontaneous breathing and during mechanical ventilation [16]. In addition, regular short recruitment manoeuvres have proved to be useful in models of isolated rat and mouse lungs [17], [18]. In mechanically ventilated mice the usefulness of RM with the specific aim to keep pulmonary compliance and other lung functions constant has been explored only sporadically. Previous RM studies in healthy mice have focused on short periods of ventilation and potential lung injury, but did not compare ventilation with and without RM over several hours [4], [5]. In addition, the effect of RM on blood pressure in mice is not well defined, although increased intrathoracic pressure might decrease cardiac output [19]. The beneficial effects of PEEP have been demonstrated in several animal studies [20]\u2013[22]. PEEP helps to prevent repetitive alveolar collapse and preserves surfactant function [1], [23]. While it is widely accepted that adequate PEEP together with low VT is a protective ventilation strategy, the effects of recurrent RM in this setting are unknown.\n\nThe present study had several aims: (1) In order to assess the consequences of MV properly, we established a set-up that permits the ventilation of mice under permanent monitoring of clinically relevant physiological parameters. (2) We used this set of parameters to define ventilatory conditions that guarantee stable lung mechanics, hemodynamics, acid base status and oxygenation over six hours. In particular, we studied the input impedance of the lung at low frequencies to distinguish mechanical properties of conductive airways and the distal lung [24]. (3) We investigated the physiological effects of recurrent RM on lung mechanics at two different tidal volumes (8 vs. 16 mL/kg) and at two different PEEP-levels (2 vs. 6 cmH2O). (4) Since inflammatory lung injury may occur even with \u2018non-injurious\u2019 ventilation [7], [8], [25], we also assessed the extent of pulmonary inflammation, i.e. microvascular permeability, pulmonary sequestration of leukocytes, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and lung histopathology. Our findings in healthy animals show that low VT ventilation will only maintain lung functions and gas exchange in a normal range if recurrent RM are used. In addition, recurrent RM reduced the extent of pulmonary inflammation, although mild inflammation was present in the lungs of all ventilated animals. The higher PEEP of 6 cmH2O was beneficial regarding lung mechanics, oxygenation and pulmonary inflammation. Thus, we suggest that a preferable ventilation strategy is one that combines low tidal volumes with sizable PEEP and recurrent recruitment manoeuvres.\n\nExperiments were performed with female C57BL/6 N mice (Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany) aged 8 to 12 weeks, weighing 20 to 25 grams. The experimental protocols were in accordance with the German animal protection law and approved by regional governmental authorities (Landesamt f\u00fcr Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz NRW, permission number: AZ 8.87-50.10.35.085).\n\nMice were initially anaesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium [75 mg/kg] and fentanyl [40 \u00b5g/kg]. Anaesthesia was maintained with pentobarbital sodium [20 mg/kg] via an intraperitoneal catheter every 30 to 60 minutes. Mice were tracheotomized with a 20-gauge cannula and connected to the ventilator. A catheter was inserted into the carotid artery, which allowed blood pressure monitoring and permanent infusion of 0.9% NaCl (200 \u00b5L/h) to prevent hypovolaemia and thrombus formation. Pulsoxymetry was performed with a tail clip (MouseOx, STARR Life-Science, Oakmont, PA, USA). Blood pressure and ECG were recorded permanently (PowerLab, ADInstruments, Spenbach, Germany). Heart rate was calculated from the ECG. Body temperature was measured rectally and kept stable between 36.5\u00b0C and 37.5\u00b0C by a homeothermic blanket (Harvard Apparatus Holliston, MA, USA).\n\nMice were ventilated for six hours with the flexiVent ventilator (SCIREQ, Montreal, Canada). All mice survived the protocol. Mice were either ventilated with low tidal volume (lowVT) of 8 mL/kg and a frequency of 180 min\u22121 or high tidal volume (highVT) of 16 mL/kg and a frequency of 90 min\u22121, so that both groups received the same minute volume. The highVT group was ventilated with 3% CO2 to maintain normocapnia without further decreasing ventilation frequency. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) was 0.5 in all experiments. A positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of either 2 cmH2O or 6 cmH2O was applied. One recruitment manoeuvre (RM) with 30 cmH2O pressure and six seconds duration was performed after onset of ventilation to open airspaces and standardize lung volume. Resistance, compliance and impedance of the lung were measured by the low-frequency forced oscillation technique every ten minutes.\n\nTwo different series of experiments were performed and analyzed separately (summarized in Table 2). The first series of experiments (Fig. 1\u20132\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8) was performed with a PEEP of 2 cmH2O. Repeated recruitment manoeuvres of 1 s duration and 30 cmH2O peak pressure were applied every five minutes (RM5) in one lowVT (lowVTRM5) and one highVT group (highVTRM5) or every 60 minutes (RM60) in one lowVT group (lowVTRM60). One lowVT and one highVT group were ventilated without RM (lowVTnoRM and highVTnoRM). One group of anaesthetized but not ventilated mice served as control. A second series of experiments (Fig. 9\u201310\n11\n12) was performed, in which mice were ventilated with a PEEP of 6 cmH2O and low VT. RM were performed every five minutes (PEEP6_RM5), every 60 minutes (PEEP6_RM60) or not at all (PEEP6_noRM).\n\nMice received 1 mg bovine serum albumin (BSA) intravenously 90 min before exsanguination for analysis of microvascular permeability. Mice were sacrificed by exsanguination via the carotid artery. Blood samples from ventilated mice were analysed for pO2, pCO2, pH, HCO3\n\u2212 and standard base excess (SBE) by blood gas analysis (ABL700, Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark). Blood gas analysis from anaesthetized control mice was not representative due to reduced breathing activity.\n\nAfter thoracotomy lungs were perfused free of blood with ice cold phosphate buffered saline. Bronchoalveolar lavage of the right lung was performed by instilling two times 300 \u00b5L NaCl via tracheal tubing. About 500 \u00b5L BAL fluid was retrieved from each mouse. BAL fluid was centrifuged and the supernatant was frozen for quantification of proteins. The pellet was transferred to a cytospin preparation, followed by a modified Giemsa stain (Diff-Quick; Medion Diagnostics, D\u00fcdingen, CH) and differential leukocyte count. Cytokine levels in serum and BAL fluid were quantified with commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) (R+D Systems, Abingdon; UK). BSA was quantified in blood serum and BAL fluid by ELISA (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, USA). The ratio of BSA in serum and BAL fluid was calculated to determine microvascular permeability. Additionally, total protein levels were measured using a DC protein assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA).\n\nThe left lung was filled with 4% formalin for fixation and embedded in paraffin for histopathological examination. Sections of 3 \u00b5m thickness were stained with hematoxilin and eosin (HE). Histopathology was evaluated in a blinded manner. The following scoring system based on four criteria was used for each histological section: neutrophils in the alveolar or interstitial space, alveolar septal thickening, alveolar congestion and formation of hyaline membranes. Each criterion scored one point, if present, thus scores ranged from 0 (none criterion found) to 4 (all four criteria observed). Nine to ten sections per lung were evaluated and the mean was calculated for every lung and every group.\n\nLung mechanics were analysed with the mixed model procedure followed by correction for false discovery rate (FDR). To evaluate lung mechanics from the groups lowVTRM60 and PEEP6_RM60 in a linear model, one time point every 60 minutes before and one after RM were analyzed separately, resulting in two separate linear slopes (lowVTRM60a and PEEP6_RM60a: before RM, lowVTRM60b and PEEP6_RM60b: after RM). BoxCox transformation was performed to achieve homoscedasticity and normal distribution, when necessary. Analyses of parametric data were carried out with One-Way Analysis of Variance and FDR correction. Non-parametric data were analysed with the Kruskall-Wallis test followed by Dunn's post-test. Data in figures are shown as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). P-values<0.05 were considered as significant. Statistical analyses were carried out with JMP 7 or SAS 9.1 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).\n\nThe first series of experiments was performed at a PEEP  = 2 cmH2O, a PEEP level that is commonly used in animal studies that aim to study VILI (see Table 1). Ventilation with 8 mL/kg and no RM (lowVTnoRM) caused a continuous decrease of pulmonary compliance (C) over more than two hours that reached a plateau at approximately 30% of the physiological baseline value (Fig. 1). Within this time pulmonary resistance (R) nearly tripled. Resistance and compliance showed less dramatic trends in mice ventilated with 16 mL/kg and no RM (highVTnoRM). In this group C plateaued earlier (60 min) at about 60% of the baseline value and R increased to a lesser degree (\u223c25%). R and C differed significantly between the lowVTnoRM and the highVTnoRM group (R: p<0.01; C: p<0.001). Respiratory input impedance revealed major alterations in the periphery of the lung. Tissue damping (G) and tissue elastance (H) were elevated in both highVTnoRM and lowVTnoRM mice, reaching significantly higher values in the lowVTnoRM group (G: p<0.01; H: p<0.001). In the latter group, airway resistance (Raw) was increased as well. The increase in G, H and Raw indicates that low VT ventilation without RM leads to closure of peripheral areas of the lung and causes a small degree of airway constriction. In consequence, hysteresivity (G/H  =  \u03b7) decreased slightly over time, but was in a comparable range in all groups.\n\nThese findings indicate that ventilation without RM leads to impaired lung functions, which stabilize within two hours, though at a low level. We therefore examined the effect of repetitive RM (30 cmH2O) every 5 min. In both the lowVTRM5 and the highVTRM5 group, lung mechanics stayed in a physiological range and remained unchanged during the whole experiment. Depending on the different tidal volumes, C and H differed reciprocally between low- and highVT groups (p<0.05). The stability of the lung mechanics demonstrates that application of deep inflations of 1 s duration and 30 cmH2O are sufficient to prevent the deterioration of lung functions in healthy mouse lungs ventilated with 2 cmH2O PEEP and moderate tidal volumes.\n\nFurther, we examined whether it would suffice to apply RM only every 60 min instead of every 5 min. This was studied in the low VT group (lowVTRM60) only. In this group, respiratory conditions were instable. R and C worsened comparable to the lowVTnoRM group, but improved significantly after each RM. These alterations were reflected in changes in G and H. However, even though each RM was beneficial, after six hours tissue elastance had increased permanently, indicating that one deep inflation per hour is not sufficient to maintain lung volume at base line values. This is illustrated by the finding that H (p<0.001), R, C, G (all p<0.01) and Raw (p<0.05) were significantly different between the lowVTRM60 and the lowVTRM5 group.\n\nAnaesthesia with pentobarbital sodium resulted in reduced heart frequency (300\u2013400 min\u22121) and mean blood pressure (50\u201360 mmHg), compared to average data of unsedated mice. ECG (data not shown), HF and BP remained unchanged throughout ventilation and were not significantly different between the groups (Fig. 2). This demonstrates that ventilation and recruitment strategy did not affect the circulation. The fluid support with 200L NaCl per hour in all groups was adequate to keep blood pressure stable. Oxygen saturation, measured by pulsoxymetry, was over 90% in all mice at all times (data not shown).\n\nBlood gas analyses revealed that infusion of saline and application of 3% CO2 in the high VT groups were adequate to keep the acid-base status stable and that ventilation resulted in normocapnia in the lowVTRM5 and highVTRM5 group, with pCO2 levels ranging from 35 to 40 mmHg (Table 3). The pO2/FiO2 ratio was between 530 and 620 mmHg in both RM5 groups and in the highVTnoRM group (Figure 3). Most mice ventilated with highVTnoRM had physiological pCO2 levels after six hours. The pO2/FiO2 ratio was decreased significantly to around 200 mmHg in the lowVTnoRM group, indicating acute respiratory failure. In this group, impaired gas exchange was further indicated by an increase in pCO2 levels to about 60 mmHg, leading to respiratory acidosis with a mean pH of 7.22. Mice in the lowVTRM60 group showed very heterogeneous pO2/FiO2 ratios between 260 and 570 mmHg and markedly increased pCO2 levels as well as initiating hypercapnic acidosis. Bicarbonate (HCO3\n\u2212) was only slightly reduced, resulting in negative values for standard base excess, but did not indicate metabolic imbalance.\n\nTotal protein levels were increased in all ventilated mice, compared to unventilated controls. Protein levels were highest in the groups without RM (Fig. 4A). The BSA BAL/serum ratio confirmed that ventilation augmented microvascular permeability in the lung, particularly when inspiratory pressures were high, as in the groups ventilated without repetitive recruitment (Fig. 4B).\n\nInterleukin-6 (IL-6) and Keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) were elevated in the BAL fluid and blood serum from all ventilated mice (Fig. 5A, B, E, F). BAL fluid from mice ventilated with lowVTRM5 showed a less dramatic increase in these pro-inflammatory cytokines. In both RM5 groups serum levels of IL-6 and KC were clearly lower than in all other ventilation groups. Interestingly, Interferon-\u03b3 induced protein (IP-10) and Tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) were not significantly increased in the BAL from ventilated mice, compared to unventilated controls (Fig. 5C, D).\n\nThe only cell types found in BAL fluid of unventilated control mice were monocytes and macrophages. In contrast, all samples from ventilated mice also contained neutrophils (Fig. 6). Numbers of neutrophils were highest in mice ventilated with high VT. Considerably less neutrophils were recruited to alveoli of lowVT mice, whereof the group lowVTRM5 had the lowest neutrophil count.\n\nHistopathological samples revealed that no severe lung injury was induced by the ventilation strategies applied (Fig. 7). Nonetheless, significant histopathological alterations were present in all ventilated lungs and were most obvious in mice ventilated with high VT (Fig. 8). Alveolar septal thickening was observed in most of the ventilated lungs, resulting in a score of one. A score of two was given, when neutrophils were observed additionally, as in most lungs from highVT mice. This is in line with the results from the differential cell count in the BAL fluid. Only some highVTnoRM mice showed alveolar congestion, bringing the lung injury score up to three. Hyaline membranes were not observed in any sections, indicating that the applied ventilation strategies induced only moderate injury in the healthy lungs.\n\nIn the second series of experiments the ventilation strategies RM5, noRM and RM60 were applied to mice ventilated with low VT and a PEEP of 6cmH2O, to find out whether the impairment of lung mechanics during ventilation with noRM and RM60 could be prevented by a higher PEEP (Fig. 9). Ventilation with RM5 at a PEEP of 6 cmH2O (PEEP6_RM5) showed stable lung functions. Ventilation without RM (PEEP6_noRM) resulted, notwithstanding the increased PEEP, in a strong decrease in C during the first 180 min of ventilation until a plateau was reached at about 30% of the initial C. Correspondingly R, G and H increased and finally doubled in this group. Also ventilation with RM60 (PEEP6_RM60) did not suffice to keep lung functions entirely stable at a PEEP of 6 cmH2O. Although the decrease in C between the RMs was relatively moderate, the initial C was not maintained over six hours. R, in contrast, returned to the initial value after each RM. In line with this, lung impedance measurements revealed a moderate increase in H, but not in G after six hours. All three groups differed significantly from each other regarding C, R, H and G, except from the parameters measured in the PEEP6_RM60 group directly after the RM. Raw and hysteresivity were not different between the groups and Raw remained at baseline in all experiments (data not shown). These results indicate that an elevation of PEEP, although it helps to stabilize lung mechanics, is not sufficient to replace repetitive RM.\n\nOne aim of the second series of experiments was to investigate whether a higher PEEP can prevent the worsening of gas exchange in mice ventilated at a PEEP  = 2 cmH2O and RM60 or noRM. The pO2/FiO2 ratio was around 500 mmHg in the PEEP6_RM60 group and around 400 mmHg in the PEEP6_noRM group (Fig. 10). Both groups differed significantly from the control group PEEP6_RM5, which showed unimpaired gas exchange with a pO2/FiO2 ratio of about 600 mmHg This further demonstrates that regular RMs are necessary even with a PEEP of 6 cmH2O. In accordance, pCO2 levels were significantly elevated in the groups PEEP6_RM60 and PEEP6_noRM, compared to the control group (data not shown).\n\nIn the second set of experiments IL-6 and KC levels in the BAL fluid were highest in the PEEP6_noRM group, followed by the PEEP6_RM5 group (Fig. 11A, B). Both mediators were lowest in the PEEP6_noRM group. IL-6 in the blood serum was not significantly different between these three groups (Fig. 11C). KC levels were highest in the group ventilated without RM, but differed only slightly between the groups ventilated with RM5 and RM60 Fig. 11D). These results indicate that a higher PEEP helps preventing the release of pro-inflammatory mediators induced by formation of atelectasis.\n\nIn the second part of the study, in which all mice were ventilated with low VT, neutrophil numbers were clearly highest in the group PEEP = 6_noRM. Numbers of neutrophils were lower in the BAL fluid from PEEP6_RM5 mice and lowest in the PEEP6_RM60 group (Fig. 12).\n\nWe compared lung mechanics during ventilation with and without RM in healthy mice over six hours during close monitoring of many clinically relevant parameters including lung mechanics, cardiovascular functions and gas exchange. Stable cardiovascular conditions resulted amongst others from appropriate fluid support, emphasizing the need for careful monitoring and stabilisation of vital parameters in animal studies.\n\nThe present study shows that protective non-injurious ventilation requires the application of frequent non-injurious recruitment manoeuvres and low VT. A ventilation pattern including deep inflations is closer to the variable breathing pattern of spontaneously breathing subjects than monotonic MV without variation in VT or breathing frequency, supporting the finding that variable or \u2018noisy\u2019 ventilation improves protective ventilation in the porcine and human lung [57], [58]. Beyond that, variable ventilation, characterised by breath-to-breath variation of VT and breathing frequency, has been shown to be beneficial in terms of reducing VILI in mice with injured lungs [59].\n\nFurthermore, our data indicate that a PEEP level of 6 cmH2O has protective effects and is therefore advisable in studies that require MV. A low PEEP of 2 cmH2O combined with recurrent RM is less protective, but still suffices to gain stable respiratory conditions and may be preferable in models that aim to investigate VILI.\n\nWe conclude that ventilation with low VT, recurrent RM and sizable PEEP is the most protective ventilation strategy for healthy mice."}
