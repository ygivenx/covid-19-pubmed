Maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees were constructed and annotated using 168 Treeannotator. SpreaD3 [36] was used to summarize and display phylogeographic results and to 169 calculate the BF of different between-countries migration rates. The transmission rate was 170 considered statistically significant (i.e. non-zero) when the BF was higher than 3 [32].\n\nHypervariable region 1-2 (HVR12) 173 Unfortunately, no strict guidelines currently exist on IBV sequencing protocols. Consequently, 174 despite the HVR3 of the S1 gene is the most commonly sequenced region, different research groups 175 have produced and published sequences obtained from other Spike protein portions. To benefit from 176 these sequences, some representative of additional countries, a second dataset based on the HVR1 177 and 2 (HVR12) was created and analyzed using the same approach previously described. However, 178 because of the limited sequence number and more balanced origin, a unique analysis was 179 performed, avoiding the multiple dataset generation step. Table) .

Nevertheless, the lower sequence 284 number and shorter time window covered by HVR12 database pose in favor of the HVR3 based 285 analysis reliability. Anyhow, these results testify the long lasting undetected circulation of this 286 genotype in Italy. The absence of adequate monitoring and diagnostic tools at that time clearly 287 justifies this evidence, which could be realistically extended to most of current IBV genotypes.\n\n288 Unfortunately, the lack of sequences relative to the period before 1963 prevents the precise 289 reconstruction of viral population dynamics in this time frame. However, the skyline profile, 290 especially from the '60s onward, when actual data became available, shows that GI-16 was able to 291 circulate and persist in Italy at low level until the '80s, when a remarkable increase in relative 390 genetic approach will be useful to elucidate the actual influence of these residues on GI-16 391 virulence.\n\n394 Overall, the present study reconstructs the history and spreading dynamics of the GI-16 lineage 395 from its origin to nowadays, demonstrating the complex network leading to its dispersal in Europe, 396 Asia and South America. Above all, the ancient history of a previously considered \"emerging\" 397 genotype is described and testifies the misconceptions that originate from the lack of a unified 398 nomenclature and poor molecular epidemiology data generation and sharing. This shortcoming 399 appears particularly relevant since the described scenario could likely be shared by many other IBV 400 genotypes and pathogens in general.
