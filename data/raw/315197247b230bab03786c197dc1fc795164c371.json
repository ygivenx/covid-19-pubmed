{"title": "Long noncoding RNA AVAN promotes antiviral innate immunity by interacting with TRIM25 and enhancing the transcription of FOXO3a", "body": "proliferation, genomic imprinting, and stem cell self-renewal (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . lncRNAs are also 48 reportedly involved in innate and adaptive immune responses, such as immune cell 49 proliferation and cytokine production (11) (12) (13) (14) . Previous studies have shown that lncRNAs 50 exert their roles in regulating chromatin accessibility, mRNA stability and protein activity by 51 interacting with chromatin DNA, mRNAs or proteins (15-18). With the discovery and 52 characterization of an increasing number of lncRNAs, several mechanisms of these lncRNAs 53 in virus-host interactions have been elucidated (19, 20) , however, many others remain 54 uncharacterized. recovery-stage counterparts (FC>2, p<0.05) and subjected them to a cluster analysis ( Fig 1B) . 100 To investigate the association between lncRNAs and IAV infection, in silico analysis 101 identified 26 novel lncRNAs candidates with notably aberrant expression (Fig 1C) . To 102 confirm the expression of these lncRNAs, we separated the neutrophils and monocytes from 103 healthy volunteers and infected the cells with influenza virus A/Beijing/501/2009 (abbreviated 104 as IAV-BJ501 or BJ501) for 12 h and found that XLOC_040025 (AVAN) was most 105 significantly up-regulated after IAV-BJ501 challenge (Fig 1D, E) . We also infected human 106 alveolar epithelial cells (A549) with IAV-BJ501 and measured the expression of the 26 lncRNAs and found that AVAN was most strongly up-regulated after IAV-BJ501 infection (Fig   108   1F ). 109 110 AVAN is preferentially up-regulated following virus infection 111 We then performed qRT-PCR to quantify AVAN expression in the RNA-Seq samples and 112 found that the results were consistent with the RNA-Seq data ( Fig S2A) . Thus, AVAN was 113 chosen for subsequent investigation. To further confirm the expression of AVAN in 114 IAV-infected patients, we collected blood samples from 63 additional IAV-positive patients 115 and measured the expression of AVAN, which was significantly up-regulated in the neutrophils 116 of these patients (Fig 2A; Table S1 ). Similarly, AVAN was up-regulated in A549 cells after 117 infection with multiple sub-strains of IAV ( Fig 2B) and several other RNA viruses, including 118 Sendai virus (SeV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) \uff0c but not the DNA virus, adenovirus 119 (ADV) (Fig S2B) . In addition, Poly (I:C), IFN-\u03b2 also could significantly stimulate the 120 expression of AVAN ( Fig S2B) . Moreover, AVAN expression was significantly up-regulated 121 upon IAV-BJ501 challenge in a time-and dose-dependent manner in A549 cells (Fig 2C, D) . 122 Absolute copy number measurement showed that AVAN was expressed at relatively low 123 levels without infection, with 11 or 14 transcript copies in per neutrophil or A549 cell 124 respectively ( Figure S2 ). Additionally, AVAN expression was also significantly up-regulated in 125 a time-and dose-dependent manner in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL60), 126 which is often a substitute for neutrophils, upon IAV-BJ501 challenge (Fig S2B, C) . 127 Subcellular fractionation followed by qRT-PCR in IAV-BJ501-infected A549 cells revealed labeling-probes was weaken (Fig S2E) . AVAN exhibits no protein-coding potential according 135 to ORF finder (33) and the coding potential calculator (34) (Fig S2F) . Only one transcript 136 variant (approximately 500 nt) of AVAN was found in A549 cells, and it was found to be 137 up-regulated upon IAV-BJ501 infection using northern blot analysis ( Fig 2G) . The exact 138 transcript length (517 nt) of AVAN was confirmed by 5' and 3' RACE (Table S2) , which 139 revealed that AVAN is polyadenylated (Fig S2G) . Taken together, lncRNA expression profiling Table S3 -S8), suggesting that AVAN participates in innate antiviral immunity. To 149 identify the functions of AVAN, we generated AVAN-overexpressing A549 cells ( Fig 3A) and 150 found that viral replication was strongly inhibited (Fig 3B) . In contrast, virus titer was up-regulated following AVAN knockdown with two specific siRNAs (Fig 3H, I (Fig 3C) . To confirm this result, we performed ELISA to measure IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 protein 160 expression and found that IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 were strongly up-regulated in 161 AVAN-overexpressing A549 cells during IAV-BJ501 infection ( Fig 3D) . Conversely, these 162 phenomena were abolished by knocking down AVAN (Fig 3J, K) . 163 The above GSEA data and GO analysis showed that the genes related to AVAN were also 164 significantly enriched in chemotaxis and immune cell activation (Fig S4A, Table S9 , S10), the 165 main components of innate immune responses. To explore the role of AVAN in chemotaxis, we 166 collected culture supernatants of AVAN-overexpressing A549cells and performed neutrophil 167 transwell assays, which revealed that AVAN overexpression significantly up-regulated 168 neutrophil chemotaxis during IAV-BJ501 infection (Fig 3E) . These phenomena were disrupted 169 by knocking down AVAN (Fig 3L) . The chemokines interleukin-8 (CXCL8, IL-8) is potent 170 neutrophil chemoattractant (38) and is released by a variety of lung cells, including 171 macrophages and epithelial cells as well as neutrophils themselves (39). IL-8 primarily 172 attracts neutrophils and induces them to release lysosomal enzymes, triggering the respiratory 173 All rights reserved.

Most of these divergent 194 genes were associated with antiviral innate immune responses and inflammatory diseases according to Reactome pathway analysis ( Fig 4B) and FunDO diseases analysis ( Fig S5) . 196 Notably, genes associated with immune system IFN signaling and cytokine signaling were 197 markedly up-regulated in cells with ectopic AVAN expression compared with control cells, 198 including chemokines and ISGs (IFN stimulated genes) (Fig 4C) . These significantly 199 up-regulated genes, including MX1, ISG15, IFIT2, OASL, IFIM3, TNFAIP3, CXCL2 and 200 CCL5, were confirmed by qRT-PCR (Fig 4D) , and these were abolished after AVAN 201 knockdown upon IAV-BJ501 infection ( Fig 4E) . These data again reveal that AVAN strongly 202 participates in antiviral innate immune processes and neutrophil chemotaxis.

These data provide evidence that AVAN plays a critical role in regulating FOXO3a 239 All rights reserved.

Previous experiments demonstrated that AVAN is located in the cytoplasm (Fig 2E, 2F ). 245 To investigate the molecular mechanism of AVAN in the cytoplasm, RNA pull-down assays 246 using biotin-labeled AVAN or AVAN antisense control followed by mass spectrometry (MS) 247 analysis were performed. The result of MS revealed that E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25, an 248 RNA-binding protein (48,49), was pulled down by AVAN in IAV-BJ501-infected A549 cells 249 but not by the AVAN antisense control (Fig 6A, Fig S7A) . This result was confirmed by AVAN 250 RNA pull-down western blot experiments ( Fig 6B) . Besides, ChIRP followed by western blot 251 revealed that AVAN-specific probes could pull down TRIM25 while LacZ couldn't ( Fig 6C) . 252 To validate the interaction between AVAN and TRIM25, we immunoprecipitated TRIM25 253 from IAV-BJ501-infected A549 cells and quantified the protein-bound AVAN. Significantly 254 higher levels of AVAN were detected with exogenous ( Fig 6D) and endogenous ( Fig 6E) 255 TRIM25 immunoprecipitation than with the isotype immunoglobulin G (IgG) control. Fig 6F) . Furthermore, to 260 explore the TRIM25 binding site on AVAN RNA, three truncated probes from AVAN were 261 All rights reserved.

The result indicated that the TRIM25-binding activity mapped 262 between nucleotides 1 and 200 ( Fig 6G) . Together, these findings indicate that AVAN The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/623132 doi: bioRxiv preprint addition, AVAN overexpression increased TBK1 and IRF3 phosphorylation upon IAV-BJ501 284 infection (Fig S7E, left) . In contrast, AVAN knockdown abolished these changes (Fig S7E,   285 right). To test whether AVAN enhances the IFN-mediated antiviral innate immune response 286 through TRIM25 and RIG-I signaling, we performed qPCR analysis measuring 287 IFN-alpha/beta upon AVAN transfection, and then individually knock down RIG-I or TRIM25. 288 The results showed that knock down RIG-I or TRIM25 abrogated AVAN-induced effects on 289 IFN-alpha/beta expression during IAV-BJ501 infection (Fig 6M, N, Fig S7F, G) . Together, 290 these data show that AVAN can enhance the interaction between TRIM25 and RIG-I and the 291 ubiquitylation of RIG-I in the cytoplasm. Thus, we conclude that AVAN promotes TRIM25-292 and RIG-I-mediated antiviral innate immune signaling. transgenic mice (TG) mice expressing human AVAN were generated as previously 298 described (52) . TG mice lung with high AVAN expression were identified and selected for this 299 experiment ( Fig 7A) . TG mice and WT littermates were i.n. inoculated with BJ501 virus. As 300 expected, IAV-BJ501 displayed a considerably lower virulence in TG mice than that in WT 301 mice. The survival rates were 60% and 20% in TG mice and WT mice after 14 days 302 post-infection, respectively (Fig 7B) . The TG mice exhibited significantly reduced body 303 weight loss at 7 days post-infection compared with the WT mice ( Fig 7C) . Meanwhile, we 304 compared the lung edema and viral loads of infected TG mice with WT littermates and found 305 All rights reserved.

Pathologic examination by HE attaining revealed that histopathlogic 307 alterations improved in TG mice ( Fig 7F) . Subsequently, we detected FOXO3a expression 308 levels and found that FOXO3a expression were undetectable in TG mice (data not shown), 309 likely due to low AVAN homology in humans and mice. Striking, we found that AVAN also 310 bind to rodent TRIM25 through RNA pull-down using TG mice tissue ( Fig 7G) and promote 311 type I IFN expression in vivo (Fig 7H) . Similarly, we constructed an AVAN-containing 312 AAV2/9 vector and a control vector, which were then delivered into 4-week-old C57L/B6 313 mice via intranasal (i.n.) administration. We found that AVAN was ectopically expressed in the 314 lung of AAV2/9-AVAN treated mice ( Fig S8A) . Strikingly, after IAV-BJ501 infection, the 315 groups pretreated with AAV2/9-AVAN exhibited significantly increased survival rates and 316 reduced body weight loss at 10 days post-infection compared with the control group ( Fig S8B,   317 C). Furthermore, lung edema, measured as the wet-to-dry ratio of whole lung, was 318 ameliorated (Fig S8D) , and improved lung histopathology was observed in infected mice 319 pretreated with AAV2/9-AVAN (Fig S8E, F) . Moreover, the virus titer from the lungs of 320 infected mice was also significantly reduced in AAV2/9-AVAN-treated mice compared with 321 that in control mice (Fig S8G, H) . In addition, AAV2/9-AVAN promote type I IFN expression 322 in vivo (Fig S8I) . Taken together, these observations indicate that expression of lncRNA AVAN The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/623132 doi: bioRxiv preprint association between TRIM25 and RIG-I and enhances RIG-I ubiquitylation, thereby 393 promoting IFN expression. It is worth noting that AVAN binds TRIM25 and facilitates IFN 394 expression in mice. In addition, we explored the impact of AVAN overexpression or 395 knockdown in IFN induction, chemo attraction of neutrophils or expression of cytokines and 396 chemokines (Fig 3) , speculated that lncRNA AVAN is critical in the IFN induction pathway. 1/4 volume of 5\u00d7 loading dye. The mixtures were then heated at 95\u00b0C and stored at -80\u00b0C. 496 The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. 497 The membranes were then blocked with 5% nonfat milk (BD) in 1\u00d7 Tris-buffered saline and 498 0.1% Triton 100 for 1 h while shaking at room temperature. Next, the membranes were 499 incubated with primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary 500 antibodies. Bands were visualized using the Kodak film exposure detection system.
