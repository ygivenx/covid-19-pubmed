{"title": "How recent advances in molecular tests could impact the diagnosis of pneumonia", "body": "Presently, we are still reliant on traditional diagnostic tools that have been used for decades to determine the microbial etiology of pneumonia. Current guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults typically recommend that microbiologic testing should be largely restricted to patients with more severe disease, and give guidance about the judicious use of blood cultures, sputum microscopy and culture, urinary antigen tests, and serology [8\u201310]. Guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia in children are even more restrictive, again recommending that tests should mainly be used on patients with severe disease, with a focus on blood cultures and detection of respiratory viruses [11,12]. Common to these guidelines is a cautious approach to the use of molecular diagnostics, although this may change with ongoing reviews. This caution is driven partly by the perceived and real lack of commercial and standardized assays and partly by lack of good data on diagnostic accuracy. There is also a lingering perception that molecular diagnostics are expensive tests and that use should be restricted on this basis. Cost is not the barrier it used to be, and the relative price of molecular diagnostics has actually fallen over recent years. Indeed, many molecular assays are now comparable in cost to conventional culture-based methods.\n\nMolecular methods have been a particularly welcome addition to the pneumonia diagnostic toolbox. Collectively, they represent the single biggest recent advance in the field. While not exactly new (polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for respiratory pathogens have been around for over 20 years), the widespread adoption of nucleic acid detection tests (NATs) by diagnostic laboratories has been relatively slow. This contrasts to NATs for other infectious diseases, which have been more quickly embraced by laboratories and clinicians [13]. A major reason for the slow uptake and acceptance of respiratory NATs has been the lack of commercial assays. This situation is changing rapidly, undoubtedly spurred on by recent outbreaks of global concern, such as pandemic influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Ebola [14\u201316]. Indeed, the increased availability of commercial assays is the major change in the area since I first started reviewing the role of molecular diagnostics in pneumonia over 10 years ago [17,18].\n\nTo date, molecular tests for pneumonia have mainly focused on detection of specific known pathogens by NATs. NATs have several advantages over other existing diagnostic tools. They potentially detect low levels of all-known pneumonia pathogens in clinical specimens, do not depend on the viability of the target microbe, and can provide results within a clinically relevant time frame. They are also probably less affected by previous antimicrobial therapy than are culture-based diagnostic methods. There are now a wide variety of user-friendly platforms that have enabled NATs to be deployed in laboratories outside of specialist tertiary referral centers. Although NATs have mainly focused on detecting the presence of a particular microorganism, they may also provide additional information, such as data on antimicrobial resistance and strain typing.\n\nThe NATs that are most widely used in diagnostic laboratories are those that detect potential pneumonia pathogens that are not part of the normal flora, namely respiratory viruses and selected non-colonizing bacteria. For these microbes, simply detecting their presence in a respiratory sample has been regarded as sufficient evidence to assign causation. In contrast, NATs for other bacteria, including some of the most important pneumonia pathogens, have struggled for a defined role outside research laboratories. NATs for detection of the following respiratory pathogens now have established roles.\n\nNATs have revolutionized the diagnosis of viral respiratory tract infections [19,20]. With high sensitivity and specificity, rapid turnaround time, and availability as commercial assays, NATs are now the testing method of choice for respiratory viruses. Respiratory viruses commonly detected by NATs, often in large multiplex panels, include influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, human metapneumovirus, human rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, adenoviruses, human bocavirus, and several coronaviruses (OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1). NATs are also established diagnostic tools for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus and MERS-coronavirus [16,20].\n\nIn the context of pneumonia, the detection of a respiratory virus in an upper respiratory specimen by a NAT has been regarded as sufficient to assign causation in both children and adults [21]. However, this assumption is not always reliable. There is still debate about the exact role (if any) of some viruses in the pathogenesis of pneumonia, including human rhinoviruses and human bocavirus [22]. This has led some to question the wisdom of using large multiplex NAT panels as first-line tests for respiratory pathogens given potential problems with interpretation of positive results [23]. In addition, when control groups are used in pneumonia etiology studies, respiratory viruses are often detected in a similar proportion of both subjects with and without pneumonia, especially in children [24,25]. These findings vary by specific virus, with influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and human metapneumovirus being typically detected in a significantly higher proportion of cases with pneumonia than controls.\n\nMycoplasma pneumoniae is associated with a variety of both upper and lower respiratory tract infections and is an important cause of pneumonia, frequently occurring in outbreaks. NATs are now widely regarded as the methods of choice for detection of M. pneumoniae infections [37,38], and a M. pneumoniae target has been incorporated alongside viral targets in many large respiratory multiplex panels. In practice, NATs have also been useful for M. pneumoniae outbreak identification and management [39]. Both upper and lower respiratory tract specimens are suitable for testing by NATs, and a positive result in the context of pneumonia is regarded as being diagnostic, as asymptomatic carriage of M. pneumoniae is uncommon [40].\n\nChlamydophila pneumoniae is a relatively common cause of community-acquired pneumonia in some geographic regions, but is not typically associated with severe disease [41,42]. NATs have long been used for diagnostic purposes and, indeed, C. pneumoniae NATs were the focus of some of the earliest efforts to standardize NATs for respiratory pathogens [43]. Perhaps because of the association with milder disease, C. pneumoniae targets have not been a priority for incorporation into multiplex respiratory panels.\n\nColonization with Pneumocystis jirovecii is common among the general population and is associated with pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals. NATs have advantages over traditional microscopy-based diagnostic tools, detecting P. jirovecii in induced sputum, bronchoscopic, or oropharyngeal specimens with high sensitivity [44]. Indeed, it was PCR-based methods that provided some of the early evidence of the existence of P. jirovecii colonization [45]. The use of quantitative methods has been necessary in order to discriminate between colonization and disease; thus, at least partially overcoming the problem of false-positive results. Although promising, the cut-off values remain to be standardized for quantitative NATs and may vary with patient population [46].\n\nMicroscopy and culture of lower respiratory samples remain the standard diagnostic tools for tuberculosis. Despite improvements in culture-based methods, the slow turnaround time for laboratory diagnosis and global concern about disease burden and multidrug resistance has provided the impetus for the development of rapid testing methods [47]. Considerable effort has been put into the development of NATs for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and several commercial assays are now widely available [48]. Interestingly, tuberculosis is unusual among infectious diseases in that NATs are less sensitive than culture, a possible consequence of difficulty with DNA extraction. Sensitivities are typically 92\u2013100% for smear-positive specimens and 40\u201393% for smear-negative specimens [48]. Importantly, small, user-friendly platforms (such as the Xpert MTB/RIF assay) have been developed to an extent that they have been successfully deployed in many resource-poor locations where rapid diagnostics for tuberculosis are most needed [47,49]. This is a real success story and highlights what can be achieved with molecular diagnostics outside major laboratories.\n\nNATs are now established tests for the detection of the causative agents of pertussis [50\u201352]. While Bordetella pertussis is the major cause of pertussis in humans and can be complicated by pneumonia [53,54], Bordetella bronchiseptica, Bordetella holmesii, and Bordetella parapertussis have all been occasionally associated with (often milder) pertussis-like illnesses [50]. NATs are the most sensitive methods for the detection of B. pertussis and, with rapid turnaround times, have been invaluable tools in outbreak management [55,56]. The main limitation of B. pertussis NATs is specificity, particularly the ability of the most widely used (IS481-based) assays to also detect B. holmesii, which is generally considered a false positive result [50]. The use of dual target assays has been advocated to overcome this potential problem [52].\n\nWhat are the limitations of molecular diagnostic tests for pneumonia and what needs to be addressed in order to progress with development? Common to all pneumonia diagnostic testing, the inability to obtain good quality specimens from the lower respiratory tract is a major problem that will only be overcome through new innovative and safe methods of specimen collection and a greater understanding of the relationships between changes in the lung and in more distant specimens in pneumonia.\n\nA second-major limitation of NATs is their inability to distinguish pathogens from innocent bystanders. In essence, we need two pieces of information. First, is a particular microorganism present in the clinical specimen? Second, if the microorganism is present, is it causing this episode of pneumonia? To date, diagnostic efforts have focused almost exclusively on the first question and have ignored the second, which is usually much more difficult to answer unless the microorganism is never present as a colonizer (e.g. Legionella spp.). The efforts to use NATs as a diagnostic for pneumococcal pneumonia illustrate some of the key issues.\n\nS. pneumoniae is regarded as the most common cause of pneumonia in all age groups and yet, molecular tests do not have an established diagnostic role [57]. S. pneumoniae is also a common nasopharyngeal colonizer, with carriage prevalence exceeding 50% among children in some regions of the world [58]. Earlier pneumococcal PCR assays, such as those targeting the pneumolysin gene, had problems of poor specificity due to detection of other, closely related streptococci [59], although false-positive results are less likely with some of the currently more widely used targets (e.g. autolysin gene) [60]. S. pneumoniae is frequently detected by NATs in both upper and lower respiratory specimens from patients with pneumonia [59], but the clinical implications of a positive result are uncertain given the relative high prevalence of pneumococcal carriage. Testing of blood for S. pneumoniae by PCR has been promoted as an alternative approach that can potentially avoid issues of contamination. Among Italian children, blood PCR showed promise as a diagnostic for invasive pneumococcal disease [61\u201364] with high specificity [65]. However, in other populations, positive results have been reported in control participants who do not have suspected pneumococcal disease [66], raising concerns about the broader utility of this approach. In particular, false-positive results are relatively common in children from developing countries where pneumococcal carriage is common [67]. Consequently, a positive pneumococcal NAT result alone is usually not enough to diagnose pneumococcal pneumonia. The possible exception is the use of NATs to detect S. pneumoniae in pleural fluid [68,69].\n\nAnother important limitation with current NATs is their focus, by nature, on specific known or suspected pneumonia pathogens. Implicit with this focus is the assumption that we know the full range of key potential pathogens that cause pneumonia. This may well be correct, but there is increasing interest in the use of modern techniques, such as next generation sequencing, which provide the opportunity for discovering new or unexpected pathogens [70,71]. The broader approach of these technologies may provide novel insights into pneumonia etiology, but have yet to show added advantage as a routine diagnostic tool [72]. No major new pneumonia pathogens have been uncovered over recent years.\n\nA key reason for the slow adoption of respiratory NATs by diagnostic laboratories is the lack of commercial assays that have been approved by regulatory bodies. The impact has probably been felt more in the USA given the strict requirements of the US FDA. The level and importance of regulation have been debated [73,74], and it is clear that a balance is needed between appropriate regulation of new diagnostics, while avoiding unnecessary barriers to the deployment of useful tests. The use of molecular tests for Legionnaires\u2019 disease is a good example of how assay regulation has had an impact on diagnostic strategies. Despite NATs being the diagnostic test of choice for Legionnaires\u2019 disease, the shortage of FDA-approved assays has severely limited the use of these tests in the USA, resulting in the continued use of suboptimal diagnostics and underdiagnosis of this disease [27]. Moreover, the absence of a prominent role in diagnostic algorithms has possibly led to an incorrect perception that the performance of NATs is inadequate. Hopefully, increased experience with these tests will reverse this perception.\n\nA major recent revelation in respiratory medicine has been recognition of the lung microbiome [75]. Until recently, the lungs in health were regarded as sterile. The use of modern culture-independent techniques has not supported this concept, consistently finding evidence of bacteria in the lower airways [75]. This important realization has challenged our traditional paradigm of pneumonia pathogenesis. The tradition view that pneumonia is caused by a single invasive pathogen in a normally sterile site is likely wrong. Increasing recognition that bacteria and viruses frequently interact in the causative pathway to pneumonia [76,77] adds additional complexity, as does the frequent finding of polymicrobial infections [78]. Under the new paradigm, dominant species emerge from the lung ecosystem in pneumonia through uncertain mechanisms, and the bacterial versus viral pneumonia concept is too simplistic. Consequently, we probably need to use more sophisticated approaches to pneumonia diagnosis than assays that simply target single specific putative pathogens.\n\nWe have a lot to learn and are only just beginning to understand changes in the microbiome during acute infections [75,79,80]. Analysis of the lung microbiome may provide insights into pneumonia etiology and reveal novel markers for pneumonia prognosis and for treatment guidance [81]. Molecular diagnostic techniques clearly have a central role in these metagenomic analyses [82,83], providing another opportunity for next generation sequencing technology.\n\nMolecular tests are now mainstream diagnostics for many respiratory infections, although we still have much to learn about using them more effectively to assist with the management of pneumonia. Those involved in molecular diagnostic test development for pneumonia need to look beyond the simple detection of specific known pathogens and also provide means to accurately interpret the clinical significance of a positive result. It is not good enough to simply assess a new test by measuring analytical sensitivity and making comparisons to the performance of other similar assays. Diagnostic tests must be evaluated properly following good epidemiological principles. New developments in molecular diagnostics must also be cognizant of emerging information about the lung microbiome, which will likely provide opportunities for the discovery of novel markers to help guide pneumonia management.\n\nThe recent expansion in the number and variety of commercial NATs is likely to continue, leading to greater uptake by diagnostic laboratories and greater incorporation into diagnostic test algorithms and guidelines for the management of pneumonia. The provision of even more user-friendly platforms will enable deployment of these tests in laboratories that have not traditionally used molecular diagnostics. Further efforts are needed to evaluate the clinical application of microbial load measurement for the purpose of distinguishing pathogens from colonizing microorganisms and as a prognostic marker.\n\nIt is still unclear about how new knowledge about the lung microbiome will affect the development of pneumonia diagnostics, but the impact may be profound. While it will be some time before next generation sequencing becomes a standard tool in diagnostic laboratories, this technology may provide valuable insights into the lung microbial ecology in health and disease and a greater understanding of the pathogenesis of pneumonia. With this comes a shift away from the targeting of a limited number of putative pneumonia pathogens toward the identification of signal patterns characteristic of different etiologies and stages of pneumonia. The hope is that these signals will have sufficient diagnostic accuracy to help guide pneumonia management.\n\n\nIdentifying the microbial etiology of pneumonia is challenging, largely due to difficulty in obtaining uncontaminated specimens from the site of infection and in discriminating between colonizing microorganisms and true pathogens.Molecular tests, particularly NATs, have been the major advance in pneumonia diagnostics over recent years.Although uptake has been relatively slow, NATs now have established roles (often as the diagnostic of choice) for the detection of respiratory viruses and several non-colonizing bacteria (e.g. Legionella species). In contrast, NATs have yet to have an established role for several important bacterial pneumonia pathogens (e.g. S. pneumoniae) that also are asymptomatic colonizers of the upper respiratory tract.Further developments in molecular tests need to focus on methods to help interpret the significance of positive results. The use of quantitative NATs and microbial load cutoffs has shown promise as one means to discriminate between colonizing and pathogenic microorganisms.The recent revelation that the lung microbiome exists and new knowledge about the interaction between bacteria and viruses has changed the traditional view of pneumonia pathogenesis. New diagnostics need to account for this new paradigm and be less focused on just detecting specific known pathogens."}
