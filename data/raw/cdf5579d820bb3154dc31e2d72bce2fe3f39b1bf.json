While comparing the tree prepared by our method (Figure 1 ) with the tree prepared by other freely available tools [1] (Figures 2, 3, 4 and 5). We found that, all glomus genera were not properly clustered together in Figures 2, 3, 4 and 5. Similarly, all gigaspora genera were not clustered together in Figure 5 . This shows the advantage of our method over others in terms of sequence clustering. Moreover, the AUC of our method is 0.88 ( Figure 6 ), which indicates that our method has moderate accuracy ( Table 1) . Phylogenetic tree on 41 mammalian sequences.

Figure 7 ) generated by our approach, were correctly divided into eight groups: Primates (red), Cetacea (green), Artiodactyla (pink), Perissodactyla (light green), Rodentia (black), Lagomorpha (dark red), Carnivore (blue), and Erinaceomorpha (grey). The cat species in our approach was clustered with the Artiodactyla group. We compared the phylogenetic tree ( Figure 7 ) generated by our approach with the phylogenetic tree (Figures 8, 9 , 10 and 11) prepared by other freely available tools [1] . In Figure 8 , eight groups were not properly clustered. In Figures 10 and 11 , Primates (1), Cetacea (2), Artiodactyla (3), Perissodactyla (4) were all divided into more than one group. Figure 9 has similarity with our result (Figure 7 ). This shows the advantage of our method over other methods (Figures 8, 10 and 11) in terms of sequence clustering. Moreover, the AUC of our method is 0.94 (Figure 12 ), which indicates that our method has high accuracy ( (Table 1) . Phylogenetic tree on 30 coronavirus sequences. Figure 19 : Our method. We employed our method to analyse the 30 coronavirus whole genome sequences along with 4 non-coronaviruses as outgroups. The 30 coronavirus were classified into five groups according to their host type. As shown in Figure 19 generated by our approach, we can observe that the 30 coronavirus along with 4 non-coronaviruses were correctly grouped according to their host type except group 1. We compared Figure 19 generated by our approach with Figures 20, 21, 22 and 23 prepared by other freely available tools [1] . Figure  20 did not cluster any group according to their host type. In Figures 22 and 23 , the four noncoronaviruses were not clustered together. None of the methods (Figures 20, 21, 22 and 23) including our method (Figure 19 ) put group 1 sequences in separate clade. This shows the efficiency of our method in terms of sequence clustering. Moreover, the AUC of our method is 0.95 (Figure 24 ), which indicates that our method has high accuracy ( \n\nBor-recu\n\nBorreliaceae, Spirochaetes\n\nClo-per-ATCC\n\nClo-per-SM101\n\nClo-per-13\n\nClostridiaceae, Firmicutes\n\nDes-vul-DP4\n\nDes-vul-Hild\n\nDes-vul-RCH1\n\nDesulfovibrionaceae Ral-H16\n\nRal-JMP\n\nBurkholderiaceae Rho-ATCC\n\nRho-KD131\n\nRhodobacteraceae Yer-CO92\n\nYer-D106004\n\nYer-KIM\n\nYer-Z176003\n\nYersiniaceae Ecoil-ABU\n\nEcoil-APEC\n\nShi-fle-17\n\nShi-fle-2a\n\nEnterobacteriaceae Proteobacteria 0.0100 Figure 26 : CV method using string length 3.\n\n( 1\u2192Bacilleceae, 2\u2192Borreliaceae, 3\u2192Clostridiaceae, 4\u2192Desulfovibrionaceae, 5\u2192Burkholderiaceae, 6\u2192Rhodobacteriaceae, 7\u2192Staphylococcaceae , 8\u2192Yersiniaceae, and 9\u2192Enterobacteriaceae).

Figures 26, 27, 28 and 29 . Moreover, the AUC of our method is 0.99 (Figure 30 ), which indicates that our method has high accuracy ( \n\nMorocco (1) AY230202.1 Figure 34 : RTD method using string length 1. As shown in Figure 31 generated by our approach, the HEV genomes were divided into separate clades based on four genotypic categories (1(red),2(grey), 3(green) and 4(blue)) except few sequences. We compared the phylogenetic tree ( Figure 31 ) generated by our approach with the phylogenetic trees (Figures 32, 33, 34 and 35 ) prepared by other freely available tools [1] . In Figure 32 , four genotypic classes were not properly clustered. In Figures 34 and 35 , four genotypic categories were separately clustered except few sequences. In Figure 33 , all HEV genomes were correctly divided into separate clades based on four genotypic categories. Above performance shows the advantage of our method over other methods (Figures 32, 34 and 35 ) in terms of sequence clustering. Moreover, the AUC of our method is 0.93 (Figure 36 ), which indicates that our method has high accuracy ( Table  1 ). We collected 58 genome dataset from different species, which includes nine primates mammalian mitochondrial genomes, ten ebolavirus (five reston virus (RESTV), five bundibugyo virus (BDBV)) complete genomes, ten SARS coronavirus, eleven hepatitis E virus, eight eutherian mammal, four arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and six bacterial isolates. As shown in Figure 37 generated by our method, we observed that all the different species genome datasets were clustered separately. We compared the phylogenetic tree ( Figure 37 ) generated by our approach with the phylogenetic trees (Figures 38, 39, 40 and 41 ) prepared by other freely available tools [1] . In Figure 38 , 58 genome datasets from different species were not properly clustered. In Figures 39, 40 and 41, eight eutherian mammals were divided into more than one clades. . In addition to the superior phylogenetic tree, the AUC of our method is 0.99 (Figure 42 ), which indicates that our method has high accuracy ( Table 1) . The phylogenetic tree ( Figure 43 ) generated by our method successfully clustered all organisms belongs to Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri and Shigella boydii in separate clades. While comparing the tree prepared by our method (Figure 43 ) with the tree prepared by other freely available tools [1] (Figures 44, 45, 46 and 47 ) . We found that, all organisms belong to Escherichia coli were not properly clustered in Figures 44, 45 and 46. However, Figure 47 has similarity with our result. However, the AUC of our method is 0.84 (Figure 48 ), which indicates that our method has moderate accuracy ( Table 1) . As shown in Figure 49 generated by our method, we can observe that all transferrin sequences (red) were clustered into two distinct clades, except rabbit transferrin sequence which was grouped with lactoferrin class. Similarly, all lactoferrin sequences (green) were clustered together, except mouse lactoferrin sequence which was grouped with transferrin class. However, the trees (Figures 50, 51 , 52 and 53) generated by other methods could not cluster the sequences properly as our method. Moreover, the AUC of our method is 0.63 ( Figure 54 ). Although BBC method has the highest AUC value but its clustering pattern to similar to our method (AUC=0.653). "}
