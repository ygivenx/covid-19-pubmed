{"title": "Lack of Mimivirus Detection in Patients with Respiratory Disease, China", "body": "Virus nucleic acids were extracted by using a QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Mimivirus was detected by real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) as described (4) .\n\nOf the 3,696 patients, only 1, a 6-month-old boy, had a positive real-time RT-PCR result (cycle threshold [C t ] 31) for mimivirus. This positive result was verified by using 2 other RT-PCRs specific for the helicase and thiol oxidoreductase genes and a nested RT-PCR (3, 6) . The PCR specific for thiol oxidoreductase showed a positive result (C t 36). An independent retesting that was performed on this positive sample in the laboratory affiliated to PLA 307 hospital was also positive. However, we could not amplify mimivirus sequences by using nested RT-PCR.\n\nSamples from 3,696 patients were simultaneously screened for influenza virus; respiratory syncytial virus; parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, 3, and 4; metapneumovirus; human rhinovirus; human adenovirus; coronavirus, and human bocavirus by using PCR. All 11 of these respiratory viruses were detected at prevalences ranging from 0.35% to 21.98% (Table) . Co-infections with 2 other respiratory pathogens, parainfluenza virus type 3 (C t 30) and bocavirus (C t 29), were detected in the mimivirus-positive patient. A sputum smear from this patient was negative for Mycobacteria tuberculosis, and other bacteria were not detected.\n\nThe mimivirus-positive patient had neonatal respiratory distress syndrome at birth and had been hospitalized 6 times because of reoccurring respiratory tract infections before the episode during which mimivirus was detected. On July 24, 2013, he had a sudden onset of a slight fever (37.8\u00b0C), cough, and diarrhea (6-7 bowel movements/ day). After he was given supportive treatment, diarrhea improved, while fever and cough were aggravated; onset of larynx asthma was also recorded. He was admitted to the Respiratory Department of Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University on July 28. Physical examination at admission showed lip cyanosis and 3 depres- 4.28 \u00d7 10 9 cells/L, a hemoglobin level of 86 g/L, and a leukocyte count of 8.28 \u00d7 10 9 cells/L with 17% neutrophils and 78% lymphocytes. The patient was given symptomatic supportive treatment, methylprednisolone sodium succinate, and 5 g of \u03b3-globulin. He was not given any antimicrobial drugs. On August 4, he was discharged from hospital after symptoms had resolved.\n\nIn conclusion, our results confirm that mimivirus is an unlikely cause of human respiratory infections in China, as reported in other countries (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . Sporadic detection of mimivirus in 1 child who was born with a compromised respiratory system and had numerous hospitalizations was most likely caused by colonization of the child with this virus during numerous hospitalizations and critical care stays. In addition, parainfluenza virus 3 and bocavirus were detected in the mimivirus-positive child. Because parainfluenza virus 3 causes pneumonia and bocavirus causes infections with respiratory symptoms, particularly in children of his age, these 2 pathogens probably caused the illness in the child."}
