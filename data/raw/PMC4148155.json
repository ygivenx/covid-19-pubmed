{"title": "Membrane\nInteracting Regions of Dengue Virus NS2A\nProtein", "body": "There are three genera\nin Flaviviridae, Flavivirus, Hepacivirus, and Pestivirus.1 Dengue virus (DENV) and several other\nhighly pathogenic viruses like the Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV)\nor the Yellow Fever virus (YFV) are part of the Flavivirus genus. For the best part of the last century, Dengue virus has been\nthe most prevalent arbovirus affecting the human population. Once\nrestricted to the tropics and subtropics, it is now spreading to previously\nunaffected zones, owing to the dispersion of its vectors, Aedes spp., driven by several factors, among them an ever-increasing\nglobal temperature and widespread traveling. Apart from that, the\nfact that the last year there were over 390 million estimated cases,2 DENV is becoming a serious threat to public health.\nAlthough the most common clinical manifestations are asymptomatic\nor mild fevers that can be tackled with well-equipped hospitals, there\nare two other serious life threatening situations with mortality rates\nsurpassing 20% if left unattended.3 The\nfact that more than 40% of the world population lives in regions where\nDengue vectors thrive, leaving close to 3 billion people at risk in\nthe world, should not be overlooked.4 Although\nseveral compounds have been identified to inhibit DENV replication,5 there is actually no clinical treatment for its\ninfection.\n\nThe DENV viral genome consists of a single strand\nof positive RNA\nthat contains a single open reading frame, encoding a polyprotein\nof more than 3000 residues. After cleavage and maturation by several\nproteases, this protein gives rise to three structural and seven nonstructural\nproteins.6 Similarly to other enveloped\nviruses, DENV enters the cells via receptor mediated endocytosis through\nclathrin coated pits.6\u22129 Once inside the cell, its proteins rearrange cellular membranes\nthat ultimately result in the formation of unique structures where\nthe replication complexes are located.10\u221212 A significant part of\nits viral cycle remains elusive, yet its proteins take part in protein\u2013protein\nand protein\u2013lipid interactions in a very intricate manner.6,9 Throughout all of its viral cycle, DENV is associated with membranes\nand all of its essential steps take place in membranes, especially\nendoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. Although the specific genome\nencapsulation, virion formation, and fusion processes are widely accepted\nto be almost exclusively carried through by the structural proteins\nC, prM, and class II fusion protein E, much is still being debated\nabout the exclusivity of those proteins in those processes.13\u221215\n\nAll the polyprotein processing and viral RNA replication steps\nare generally assigned to the nonstructural proteins, including the\nformation of replication complexes of the virus.16 The accumulated knowledge on the functions of NS1, NS2A,\nNS4A, and NS4B on the viral cycle is very sparse, mainly due to their\nconsiderable hydrophobicity and the difficulty of discerning their\nexact roles.17 NS4A and NS4B seem to be\ninvolved in the host\u2019s immune system evasion and immune response,\naffecting several pathways.18,19 Protein NS1 is found\nmainly in the cytosol of the cell, rendering it an ideal antigen for\nDENV infection detection, and seems to play a role in autophagy as\nwell.20 One of the proteins found in the\nreplication complex of flaviviruses is NS2A,16 what would certify its role in the viral replication. This protein\nis required for the proper processing of NS1, possesses specific recognition\nsites for certain proteases, is also involved in the interferon inhibition\nby NS4A and NS4B, and is mainly found in ER membranes.18,21,22 Recently, a topology model was\nproposed where NS2A is described as having one N-terminal segment\nfrom residues 1 to 31 with no described membrane interaction, followed\nby a segment, residues 32\u201368, that despite lacking the ability\nto traverse the membrane is proposed to be in close association with\nit.23 Two transmembrane segments ensue\nfrom residues 69 to 119, followed by a non-transmembrane segment from\nresidues 120 to 142, and ending with three transmembrane segments\nfrom residues 143 to 209.\n\nWe have resorted to a set of biophysical\nmethods used extensively\nin our laboratory24\u221231 that allow the screening of membrane interacting regions from viral\nproteins. We sought to highlight regions that could be important for\nproper NS2A function, since this protein, essential in the viral RNA\nreplication process, is a poorly characterized highly hydrophobic\nprotein that requires the membrane to perform its functions. Furthermore,\nDENV protein/lipid and protein/protein interactions are thought to\nbe therapeutic targets for DENV infection. From both of those points,\nwe sought to highlight the membrane-active regions of this protein,\nidentifying several regions with different interacting capabilities.\nBesides, we characterize a NS2A peptide, peptide dens25, with interesting\nproperties on membranes. We resorted to several biophysical techniques,\nsuch as fluorescence spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry\n(DSC), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), using several\nmodel membrane systems. These results possibly provide new therapeutic\ntargets needed to develop new strategies to thwart this highly worrying\npublic health problem.\n\nA set of 35 peptides encompassing\nthe full length of Dengue Virus Type 2 NGC NS2A protein (Table 1) was provided by BEI Resources, National Institute\nof Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Manassas, VA, USA. Peptides were\nsolubilized with H2O/2,2,2-trifluoroethanol at a 70:30\nratio (v/v). The peptides had a purity of about 80%. The peptide dens25\ncorresponding to the sequence30KHAILLVAVSFVTLITGNMSFRDLGR55 from Dengue Virus Type 2 NGC NS2A protein (with\nN-terminal acetylation and C-terminal acetylation) and a purity greater\nthan 95% was obtained from Genemed Synthesis, San Antonio, TX, USA.\nTo prevent the infrared interference of residual trifluoroacetic acid\nat around 1673 cm\u20131,32 the peptide sample was subjected to at least three lyophilization/solubilization\nsteps in 10 mM hydrochloric acid.33 Bovine\nbrain phosphatidylserine (BPS), bovine liver l-\u03b1-phosphatidylinositol\n(BPI), cholesterol (Chol), egg phosphatidic acid (EPA), egg l-\u03b1-phosphatidylcholine (EPC), egg l-\u03b1-phosphatidylglycerol\n(EPG), egg sphingomyelin (ESM), egg trans-sterified l-\u03b1-phosphatidylethanolamine\n(TPE), tetramyristoyl cardiolipin (CL), liver lipid extract, bis(monomyristoylglycero)phosphate\n(BMP), 1,2-dimyristoilphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), 1,2-dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol\n(DMPG), 1,2-dimyristoylphosphatidylserine (DMPS), 1,2-dimyristoylphosphatidic\nacid (DMPA), and 1,2-dielaidoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine\n(DEPE) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL, USA).\nThe composition of the synthetic endoplasmic reticulum was EPC/CL/BPI/TPE/BPS/EPA/SM/Chol\nin the following proportion 59:0.37:7.7:18:3.1:1.2:3.4:7.8.34,35 According to the manufacturer, the liver lipid extract contains\n42% phosphatidylcholine, 22% phosphatidylethanolamine, 7% Chol, 8%\nphosphatidylinositol, 1% lysophosphatidylinositol, and 21% miscellaneous\nlipids including neutral ones. 5-Carboxyfluorescein (CF, >95% by\nHPLC),\ndeuterium oxide (99.9% by atom), Triton X-100, EDTA, and HEPES were\nacquired from Sigma-Aldrich (Madrid, Spain). 1,6-Diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene\n(DPH) and N-(fluorescein-5-thiocarbamoyl)-1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (fluorescein DHPE or FPE)\nwere acquired from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR, USA). Every other\nreactant was obtained in its purest form from Sigma-Aldrich (Madrid,\nSpain). Deionized water was distilled twice and passed through a Milli-Q\napparatus (Millipore Ib\u00e9rica, Madrid, Spain) to a resistivity\nhigher than 18 M\u03a9\u00b7cm.\n\nAliquots with previously quantified\nformulations and dissolved in a 2:1 (v/v) chloroform to methanol solution\nwere put under a stream of O2-free N2 to evaporate\nthe solvent and then put under a vacuum protected from light for over\n3 h to ensure no traces of solvent remained. To obtain multilamellar\nvesicles (MLVs), resuspended lipid samples were incubated at either\n25 or 10 \u00b0C above their phase transition temperatures and subjected\nto five freeze/thaw cycles with a vortex in between. Large unilamellar\nvesicles (LUVs) with a mean diameter of 0.1 \u03bcm were prepared\nfrom MLVs by the extrusion method36 using\npolycarbonate filters (Nuclepore Corp., Cambridge, CA, USA). For FTIR\nspectroscopy, 200 \u03bcg of peptide was added to the appropriate\namount of dried lipid and lyophilized. These samples were resuspended\nin 100 \u03bcL of D2O buffer with 20 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA,\nand either 25 or 100 mM NaCl at pH 7.4, and MLVs were obtained as\nstated above. As a final step, samples were centrifuged at 14000 rpm\nat 25 \u00b0C for 10 min to eliminate unbound peptide. The pellet\nwas resuspended in 25 \u03bcL of D2O buffer and incubated\nfor 45 min at 10 \u00b0C above the Tm of\nthe lipid mixture. Both peptide and lipid concentration were measured\nby methods described elsewhere.37,38\n\nLUVs with a mean diameter\nof 0.1 \u03bcm were prepared as indicated above in buffer containing\n10 mM Tris, 20 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 (at 25 \u00b0C), and 40 mM CF. Nonencapsulated\nCF was removed from the liposome suspension by using size-exclusion\nchromatography with Sephadex G-50 (GE Healthcare), with elution buffer\ncomposed of 10 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl (except in the case of one single\nexperiment with liver lipid extract where 40 mM NaCl was used), and\n0.1 mM EDTA at pH 7.4. Membrane rupture (leakage) of intraliposomal\nCF was determined by exposing the CF-containing liposomes (final lipid\nconcentration, 0.125 mM) with the appropriate amounts of peptide (peptide-to-lipid\nmolar ratio of 1:25) on microtiter plates using a microplate reader\n(FLUOstar; BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany), stabilized at 25 \u00b0C,\nwith each well containing 170 \u03bcL. Sample mixing was achieved\nby continuous shaking. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 492\nand 517 nm, respectively. The maximum leakage value was defined as\nthat achieved following the addition of Triton X-100 to attain a final\nconcentration of 0.5% (w/w). Three fluorescence measurements were\nperformed at different times: before the addition of the peptide,\nafter its addition, and finally following Triton X-100 addition. The\nleakage induced by any of those peptides was defined according to\nthe following equation, % Release = 100(Ff \u2013 F0)/(F100 \u2013 F0), where F0 is the initial fluorescence of the vesicle\nsuspension, Ff is the equilibrium value\nof fluorescence after peptide addition, and F100 is the fluorescence value after addition of Triton X-100.\nFor further details, see refs (39 and 40).\n\nMLVs were\nprepared as stated previously in buffer containing 20 mM HEPES either\nalone or containing different concentrations of NaCl or KCl at pH\n7.4 and 25 \u00b0C. Aliquots of DPH in N,N\u2032-dimethylformamide at 0.2 mM were added to the\nliposome preparation at a probe/lipid molar ratio of 1:500. DPH and\nits derivatives are widely used as probes to assess membrane dynamics\nand arrangement. DPH localizes into the hydrophobic core of the lipid\npalisade.41 Preparations were incubated\nat 10 \u00b0C above the phase transition temperature Tm of the phospholipid mixture for 1 h. Subsequently, the\npeptides were added to obtain a peptide/lipid molar ratio of 1:15\nand incubated for 1 h 10 \u00b0C above the Tm of each lipid, with occasional vortexing. Fluorescence experiments\nwere carried out using 5 mm \u00d7 5 mm quartz cuvettes in a final\nvolume of 400 \u03bcL (315 \u03bcM lipid concentration). The steady\nstate fluorescence anisotropy was measured with an automated polarization\naccessory using a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrometer, coupled\nto an automatized Peltier temperature changer. The vertically and\nhorizontally polarized emission intensities were corrected for background\nscattering by subtracting the corresponding polarized intensities\nof a phospholipid preparation without DPH. The G-factor\nwas determined by measuring the polarized components of the fluorescence\nof the probe with horizontally polarized excitation (G = IHV/IHH). Excitation and emission wavelengths were set as 360 and 430 nm,\nrespectively, with 5 nm slits. Anisotropy values were calculated using\nthe formula \u27e8r\u27e9 = (IVV \u2013 GIVH)/(IVV + 2GIVH), where IVV and IVH are the\nmeasured fluorescence intensities with the excitation polarizer vertically\noriented and the emission polarizer vertically and horizontally oriented,\nrespectively.\n\nLUVs with\na mean diameter of 0.1 \u03bcM were obtained as stated previously\nand in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl at pH 7.4 (at 25\n\u00b0C). As described elsewhere, only the outer bilayer leaflet was\nlabeled with FPE.42 LUVs were incubated\nwith 0.1 mol % FPE dissolved in ethanol (never more than 0.1% of the\ntotal aqueous volume) at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h in the dark. Unincorporated\nFPE was removed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated\nwith the appropriate buffer. FPE vesicles were stored at 4 \u00b0C\nuntil use in an O2-free atmosphere. The fluorescence of\nFPE-labeled vesicles was measured after the desired amount of peptide\nwas directly added into 400 \u03bcL of lipid suspension (200 \u03bcM\nlipid) using a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrometer. Excitation\nand emission wavelengths were 490 and 520 nm, respectively, with 5\nnm slits. Temperature was maintained at 25 \u00b0C throughout the\nexperiment. Background scattering was subtracted from probe free samples.\nData were fitted to a hyperbolic binding model43 considering the following formulas, F = Fmax[P]/(Kd + [P])\nor F = Fmax[P]n/(Kd + [P]n), where F is the fluorescence intensity, Fmax the maximum fluorescence intensity, [P]\nthe concentration of peptide, Kd the dissociation\nconstant of the membrane binding process, and n the\nHill coefficient.\n\nMLVs were formed\nas stated above in 20 mM HEPES and different concentrations of NaCl\nat pH 7.4. Peptides were added to obtain a peptide/lipid molar ratio\nof 1:10 at a final lipid concentration of 600 \u03bcM. Samples were\nincubated 10 \u00b0C above the Tm of each\nlipid for 1 h with occasional vortexing. Before loading the samples\ninto the calorimetric cell, samples were degassed under a vacuum for\n10\u201315 min with gentle stirring. DSC experiments were performed\nin a VP-DSC differential scanning calorimeter (MicroCal LLC, MA) under\na constant external pressure of 30 psi in order to avoid bubble formation.\nSamples were heated at a constant scan rate of 60 \u00b0C/h. Experimental\ndata were corrected from small mismatches between the two cells by\nsubtracting a buffer baseline prior to data analysis. The excess heat\ncapacity functions were analyzed using Origin 7.0 (MicroCal software).\nThe error in determination of Tc was 0.2\n\u00b0C. The thermograms were defined by the onset and completion\ntemperatures of the transition peaks obtained from heating scans.\nThe phase transition temperature was defined as the temperature at\nthe peak maximum. Only reproducible and reversible scans were considered\nfor analysis.\n\nA sample volume\nof 25 \u03bcL\nprepared as stated above was placed between CaF2 windows\nseparated by 50 \u03bcm thick Teflon spacers in a liquid demountable\ncell (Harrick, Ossining, NY). The spectra were obtained in a Bruker\nIF66S spectrometer using a DTGS detector. Each spectrum was obtained\nby collecting 300 interferograms with a nominal resolution of 2 cm\u20131. A fast Fourier transform algorithm with triangular\napodization was applied, and a shuttle accessory was used to average\nboth sample and background spectra in the same time frame. The spectrometer\nwas continuously purged with dry air at a dew point of \u221240\n\u00b0C. Samples were equilibrated at the lowest temperature for 20\nmin prior to acquisition. An external bath circulator, connected to\nthe infrared spectrometer, controlled the sample temperature. For\ntemperature studies, samples were scanned using 2 \u00b0C intervals\nand a 2 min delay. Data analysis methodologies were performed interactively\nusing either GRAMS/32 or Spectra-Calc (Galactic Industriesm Salem,\nMA) as described elsewhere.39,44\n\nNS2A is a membrane protein with possibly five transmembrane domains\nand at least two membrane interacting regions.23 NS2A, essential in the viral RNA replication, is undercharacterized\npossibly owing to its significant hydrophobicity. Therefore, a multitude\nof problems arise when trying to define structure, function, and lipid\u2013protein\ninteracting regions. We have conducted a screening of membrane-active\nregions of DENV NS2A protein, relying on a peptide library that represents\nthe full length NS2A protein composed of 35 different overlapping\npeptides (Table 1). Because the library includes\nthe complete linear sequence of this protein and each individual peptide, i, overlaps with two and three consecutive peptides, i + 1 and i + 2, by approximately 11 and\n5 residues, respectively, the obtained data should be analyzed considering\nthe effect of protein segments rather than that of isolated peptides.\nFurthermore, we have performed a thorough characterization of the\neffect that a peptide coincident with a membrane-active region of\nprotein NS2A, peptide dens25, has on different membrane model systems\nwith interesting results, possibly important to highlight new therapeutic\ntargets for DENV infection.\n\nAssuming the 3D organization of\nNS2A\u2019s amino acids as an\n\u03b1-helix and applying it to the whole sequence,31 the respective average normalized water-to-membrane and\nwater-to-interface transfer free energy scales for each of the residues\nand for 35 DENV NS2A strain specific sequences have been obtained\n(Figure 1A). Ten distinct regions having considerable\nhydrophobic and interfacial values throughout the protein sequence\ncan be resolved: region a encompassing residues from 6 to 19, region\nb from 30 to 54, region c from 55 to 62, region d from 70 to 83, region\ne from 83 to 93, region f from 101 to 115, region g from 124 to 136,\nregion h from 145 to 164, region i from 165 to 182, and region j from\n192 to 211. Xie et al.23 suggested the\nexistence of eight different regions for the NS2B topology: regions\n1 (residues 3\u201324), 2 (residues 32\u201351), and 5 (residues\n120\u2013140) as peripheral segments and regions 3 (residues 69\u201393),\n4 (residues 100\u2013118), 6 (residues 143\u2013163), 7 (residues\n165\u2013186), and 8 (residues 189\u2013209) as transmembrane\nsegments (see Figure 1A). Interestingly, regions\na, b, and g coincide with regions 1, 2, and 5, whereas regions d\u2013e,\nf, h, i, and j coincide with regions 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8. Region c has\nboth a lower intensity and a smaller length than expected to be considered\nas either a membrane interacting domain or a transmembrane segment.31 The existence of pre-transmembrane domains with\na strong propensity for partitioning into membrane interfaces in different\nviral proteins is well-known.31 These domains\nshow characteristic high water-to-interface transfer free energies\noverlapping with high water-to-bilayer transfer free energies. Figure 1B shows the normalized water-to-bilayer and water-to-interface\ntransfer free energies for NS2A region b encompassing amino acids\n30\u201355 (the sequence is also shown). As observed, this segment\nhas a significant high water-to-bilayer transfer free energy immediately\nfollowed by a region of high water-to-interface transfer free energy,\na characteristic pattern of pre-transmembrane domains (so-called stem\nor membrane-proximal domains). This pattern is characterized by a\nstrong propensity to partition into and interact with membrane interfaces,25,45\u221252 suggesting that this segment might interact significantly with membranes.\nRegion 2 is coincidental with region b, and has already been proposed\nto associate with the membrane.23 It should\nnot be ruled out that this domain\u2019s effect on membranes could\nbe similar to other viral pre-transmembrane domains (see below).\n\nThe membrane leakage results for\nthe NS2A peptide library are shown\nin Figure 2. We have considered seven different\nlipid compositions, simple and complex: EPC (Figure 2A), EPC/Chol at a phospholipid molar ratio of 5:1 (Figure 2B), EPC/BMP at a phospholipid molar ratio of 5:1\n(Figure 2C), EPC/BPI at a phospholipid molar\nratio of 5:1 (Figure 2D), and EPC/SM/Chol at\na phospholipid molar ratio of 5:2:1 (Figure 2E), whereas the complex ones consisted of an ER synthetic lipid mixture\nresembling the ER membrane (Figure 2F) and\na lipid extract of liver membranes (Figure 2G). The leakage data showed that some peptides exerted a quite significant\nleakage effect with a minor dependence on lipid composition. The leakage\neffects were focused on two segments, one segment delimited by residues\n25\u201341 corresponding to peptide 5 and a long segment delimited\nby residues 103\u2013183 (peptides 18\u201329). Leakage elicited\nby peptide 5 was remarkable in the presence of liver liposomes, since\na leakage value of about 45% was observed (Figure 2G). Lower but significant values were found for liposomes\ncontaining BMP (about 18%, Figure 2C) and ER-like\nmembranes (about 10%, Figure 2F). Leakage values\nelicited by peptides 18\u201329 were lower than that observed with\npeptide 5, oscillating between 10 and 20%. Apart from these differences,\nleakage induction was consistent throughout all liposome compositions\nused (Figure 2). Interestingly, peptide 5 overlaps\nregion b and peptides 18\u201329 overlap regions f, g, h, and i.\nPeptide 5 would be defined by a significant leakage value concurrent\nwith high hydrophobicity and interfaciality (see above) and therefore\nwould partition extensively to the membrane interface.31\n\nPhospholipids can undergo a cooperative melting reaction\nrelated\nto the increase in disorder of the lipid palisade; this melting process\ncan be influenced by many types of molecules including peptides and\nproteins. To assess the influence of the NS2A peptide library on the\nstructural and thermotropic properties of phospholipid membranes,\nwe measured the temperature dependence of the steady-state fluorescence\nanisotropy of the fluorescent probe DPH incorporated into model biomembranes\n(DMPC, Supplemental Figure 1 (Supporting Information), and DMPG, Supplemental Figure 2 (Supporting\nInformation)). There were no significant changes in the Tm values of DMPC in the presence of the NS2A\nderived peptides, but some of them, namely, peptides 2, 5, and 12,\nelicited a significant effect on anisotropy and cooperativity (Supplemental\nFigure 1, Supporting Information). In the\ncase of DMPG, there were more peptides affecting the thermotropic\nbehavior of the phospholipid (Supplemental Figure 2, Supporting Information). However, peptides 2, 5, 10, and 12\nwere the ones that showed a significant effect on the cooperativity, Tm, and/or the anisotropy of DMPG. These data\nwould suggest that these peptides should interact with membranes at\na relative deep location, considering that DPH is known to locate\ninside the palisade structure of the membrane. The specific effect\nthat these peptides have on DMPG does not seem to be exclusively electrostatic,\nsince the net charges of peptides having a remarkable effect, i.e.,\npeptides 2, 5, 10, and 12, are \u22122, +2, \u22121, and 0, respectively\n(Table 1).\n\nAs shown above, peptide 5\npresents a distinctive pattern characteristic\nof a membrane-proximal domain (Figure 1B),\nelicits a significant leakage value (Figure 2), and affects the thermotropic behavior of DMPC (Supplemental Figure\n1, Supporting Information) and DMPG (Supplemental\nFigure 2, Supporting Information). Furthermore,\nthe region where peptide 5 resides has been proposed to bind to the\nmembrane surface.23 Therefore, we have\ncarried out a thorough characterization of peptide dens25, corresponding\nto the NS2A segment comprised by residues 30\u201355 and its membrane\ninteractions in order to assess the membranotropic character of this\nprotein region. Since peptide dens25 lacks a Trp residue and therefore\nintrinsic fluorescence, we considered the FPE probe,40 sensitive to the electrostatic surface potential, to detect\nthe binding extension of the peptide to membranes with distinct lipid\ncompositions and lipid/peptide ratios (Figure 3A). Peptide dens25 showed a higher affinity for model membranes composed\nof negatively charged phospholipids, as well as the complex ER and\nliver lipid membranes. The dependence of peptide binding on the membrane\nsurface total charge is demonstrated by the linear dependence of FPE\nfluorescence and EPG content for membranes containing different lipid\nmolar ratios of EPC and EPG (Figure 3A, inset).\nA similar linear relationship is observed for EPC/BPS membranes (not\nshown). Interestingly, a lower affinity was observed for zwitterionic\nliposomes, i.e., those composed of EPC, EPC/Chol, and EPC/SM/Chol\n(Figure 3A). All FPE binding data could be\nadjusted to either a sigmoidal (Hill coefficient of approximately\n1) or a hyperbolic binding model, suggesting that the peptide might\ninteract with membranes as a monomer.\n\nPeptide dens25 was able to induce the release of encapsulated\nCF\nin a dose- and composition-dependent manner (Figure 3B). Liposomes composed of EPC/EPG and EPC/BPS presented respective\nleakage values of 91 and 90% at peptide/lipid ratios of 0.066. Noteworthy\nleakage values were observed for liposomes composed of the ER-like\ncomplex mixture and the liver lipid extract, since, at the same peptide/lipid\nratios, leakage values of 84 and 78% were found. Liposomes composed\nof EPC and EPC/ESM at a molar ratio of 5:1 presented similar leakage\nvalues of 68 and 71%, respectively. However, addition of Chol to these\nlast lipid compositions, i.e., EPC/Chol at a molar ratio of 5:1 and\nEPC/ESM/Chol at a molar ratio of 5:1:1, significantly reduced the\nleakage values to 53 and 56%, respectively. From all of these data,\nit could be concluded that peptide dens25 exerts a higher leakage\non liposomes composed of negatively charged phospholipids but a lower\none when Chol is present.\n\nAs noted above, peptide dens25\nseems to interact more significantly\nwith negatively charged phospholipids, with this interaction being\neither with the phospholipid headgroup or with the negative charge\nor both. In order to discriminate between these possibilities, we\nhave studied the contribution of ionic strength to the thermotropic\nphase behavior of the negatively charged phospholipid DMPG in the\nabsence and in the presence of peptide dens25 by steady-state fluorescence\nanisotropy of the fluorescent probe DPH (Figure 4). In the absence of salts, the transition of pure DMPG was a broad\none (Figure 4A), as it has been noted before.60 In the presence of peptide dens25 at a lipid/peptide\nmolar ratio of 10:1, the anisotropy of DMPG increased significantly\nabove Tm (Figure 4A), but the cooperativity of the transition was similar to that found\nin pure DMPG (Figure 4M). When increasing concentrations\nof either NaCl (Figure 4C, E, G, I, and K)\nor KCl (Figure 4D, F, H, J, and L) were added\nto pure DMPG, the cooperativity of the phospholipid increased. However,\nwhen dens25 was present, the cooperativity of DMPG increased steadily,\nalthough slightly, at increasing concentrations of either NaCl or\nKCl (Figure 4M). As observed in the figure,\neven at a concentration of 300 mM of either NaCl or KCl, the cooperativity\nwas lower than that found for the pure phospholipid but higher than\nthe cooperativity found at lower salt concentrations. These data would\nsuggest that the interaction between the peptide and the negatively\ncharged phospholipids would be mainly of an electrostatic nature.\nThe difference of anisotropy in the absence and in the presence of\npeptide is shown in Figure 4N. It can be observed\nthat the difference is inversely proportional to the salt concentration,\nbeing lower for NaCl than for KCl, which would indicate that not only\nan increase in ionic strength reduces dens25\u2019s effect on membranes\nbut also there are subtle differences between the sodium and potassium\nions.\n\nThe effect of peptide dens25 on the thermotropic phase\nbehavior\nof different phospholipids was studied using DSC (Figure 5). When properly hydrated and in the presence of\nsalt, DMPC and DMPG display two endothermic peaks on heating, corresponding\nto the pretransition (appearing at about 12\u201314 \u00b0C, L\u03b2\u2032\u2013P\u03b2\u2032) and the\nmain transition (appearing at about 23\u201324 \u00b0C, P\u03b2\u2032\u2013L\u03b1). Incorporation of dens25 into DMPC at\na lipid/peptide ratio of 10:1 elicited no noticeable effect on the\nthermotropic behavior of the pure phospholipid, neither at low nor\nat high ionic strength (Figure 5A and B, respectively).\nIn contrast, the main transition of pure DMPG at 25 mM NaCl was apparently\ncomposed of two different peaks, which should be due to mixed phases\n(Figure 5C). Incorporation of peptide dens25\ninduced a significant lowering of the cooperativity of the transition,\nbut no apparent changes to the number of peaks were clearly visible\n(Figure 5C). In the presence of 100 mM NaCl,\nthe main transition of pure DMPG was composed of only one peak, as\nexpected, showing a large cooperativity (Figure 5D). When dens25 was incorporated into the membrane, a broad main\ntransition peak was observed, indicating a significant lowering in\ncooperativity (Figure 5D). The pattern observed\nat 300 mM NaCl for pure DMPG was similar to the one found at 100 mM\nNaCl, since only one very cooperative peak was observed (Figure 5E and D, respectively). The addition of peptide\ndens25 lowered the cooperativity of the main transition, but the width\nat 300 mM NaCl was narrower than that at 100 mM, indicating that an\nincrease of NaCl concentration induced an increase in the cooperativity\nof its transition (Figure 5D and E). In the\ncase of DMPS, a similar pattern was visible. In the presence of 25\nmM NaCl, peptide dens25 induced a significant decrease in cooperativity\nin DMPS if compared to the pure lipid sample (Figure 5F), whereas in the presence of 100 mM NaCl the peptide barely\naffected the main transition of the phospholipid (Figure 5G). In the presence of 25 mM NaCl, 14BMP, a negatively\ncharged phospholipid, presented two low-enthalpy peaks and one high-enthalpy\npeak (Figure 5H). In the presence of dens25,\ntwo peaks were observed, a low-enthalpy peak and a high-enthalpy one,\nthe latter displaced to lower temperatures when compared to the pure\nlipid. In the presence of 100 mM NaCl, 14BMP presented a normal pattern,\ni.e., a low-enthalpy peak and a high-enthalpy peak corresponding to\nthe Lc1\u2013Lc2 and Lc2\u2013L\u03b1 transitions (Figure 5I). Apart\nfrom abolishing the low-enthalpy peak, peptide dens25 did not exert\nany other significant effect on the high-enthalpy high-temperature\npeak (Figure 5I). These DSC data would suggest\nthat peptide dens25 affects more significantly the phase transition\nof negatively charged phospholipids in the absence of salt, an effect\nthat is significantly increased when the ionic strength is reduced;\ni.e., the less salt concentration, the bigger the effect dens25 has\non negatively charged phospholipids.\n\nTo further explore the effects of peptide dens25 on different\ntypes\nof model membranes, we have studied the ester C=O stretching\nband of DMPC and DMPG, which appears between 1745 and 1720 cm\u20131 in infrared spectroscopy (Figure 6). The frequency maximum of the ester C=O band of pure\nDMPC in the presence of 25 mM NaCl had two transitions, one at about\n17 \u00b0C and the other at about 23 \u00b0C, coincident with the\npretransition and main gel to liquid crystalline phase transition\nof the pure phospholipid (Figure 6A). When\ndens25 was present, the frequency of the ester C=O band of\nDMPC displayed only one transition at about 24 \u00b0C (Figure 6A). Nonetheless, its frequency maximum was higher\nin the presence of the peptide than in its absence, suggesting that\nthe peptide increased the intensity of the 1743 cm\u20131 component relative to the 1727 cm\u20131 one; i.e.,\nthe quantity of non-hydrogen-bonded C=O ester bands increased\nin the presence of dens25.61,62 In the presence of\n100 mM NaCl, a relatively similar pattern was found for DMPC (Figure 6B). The frequency maximum of the ester C=O\nband of the pure phospholipid displayed two transitions at about 16\nand 24 \u00b0C, i.e., the pretransition and the main phase transition\n(Figure 6A). In the presence of the peptide,\nthe frequency of the ester C=O band displayed two transitions,\na broad one at about 16 \u00b0C and a narrow one at 24 \u00b0C. As\nbefore, its absolute frequency was higher in the presence of dens25\nthan in its absence; however, it was not as high as it was found in\nthe presence of 25 mM NaCl (compare parts A and B of Figure 6). The frequency maximum of the ester C=O\nband of pure DMPG in the presence of 25 mM NaCl displayed two transitions,\na broad one at about 14 \u00b0C and a narrow one at 23 \u00b0C, coincident\nwith the pretransition and main phase transition of the pure phospholipid\nin accordance with the DSC data (Figure 6C).\nNoteworthy is the result that the frequency of the ester C=O\nband of DMPG in the presence of dens25 displayed no transition at\nall in the temperature range studied (Figure 6C). In the presence of 100 mM NaCl, the frequency maximum of the\nester C=O band of pure DMPG displayed two transitions, a broad\none at about 14 \u00b0C and a relatively cooperative one at 22 \u00b0C,\ncoincident with the pre- and main transition of the pure phospholipid\n(Figure 6C). In the presence of the dens25\npeptide, the frequency of the ester C=O band displayed only\na broad transition at about 24 \u00b0C, in accordance with the calorimetric\ndata (Figure 6D). Its absolute frequency was\nhigher in the presence of the peptide than in its absence but at temperatures\nhigher than the main transition (Figure 6D).\nAll these data would suggest that dens25 affects the phase transition\nof DMPG, a negatively charged phospholipid, but not that of DMPC,\na zwitterionic one, in the presence of relatively low concentrations\nof NaCl. Conversely, the interaction of peptide dens25 with DMPG is\nabolished at relatively high salt concentrations.\n\nWe have also studied\nthe overall secondary structure of dens25\nin the presence of DMPC and DMPG at different salt concentrations\nby analyzing the dens25 infrared amide I\u2032 band (Figure 6). The infrared amide I\u2032 spectra of fully\nhydrated dens25 in the presence of DMPC and 25 mM NaCl below and above\nthe lipid\u2019s main phase transition temperature are shown in\nFigure 6A. At both temperatures, the amide\nI\u2032 band presented two bands appearing at about 1623 and 1648\ncm\u20131, the former with relative lower intensity than\nthe latter. The bands at about 1623 and 1648 cm\u20131 arise from the presence of aggregated \u03b2 structures and mainly\nunordered and helical structures, respectively.63,64 Upon data fitting, the relative intensity of the 1648 cm\u20131 band was about 73% and about 27% for the 1623 cm\u20131 band. In the presence of 100 mM NaCl and below and above the main\ntransition of the phospholipid, the amide I\u2032 band of dens25\npresented a similar pattern, i.e., two bands at about 1648 and 1623\ncm\u20131, with relative intensities of 68 and 32%, respectively\n(Figure 6B). The infrared amide I\u2032 spectra\nof fully hydrated dens25 in the presence of DMPG and 25 mM NaCl below\nand above the main phase transition of the phospholipid are shown\nin Figure 6C. In this case and in contrast\nto the DMPC sample, the amide I\u2032 band of dens25 presented two\nbands with slightly different frequencies. These two bands have a\nmaximum at about 1653 and 1626 cm\u20131, and their relative\nintensities were about 85 and about 15%, respectively (Figure 6C). When 100 mM NaCl, both below and above the main\ntransition of the phospholipid, the amide I\u2032 band of dens25\npresented two bands, but their frequencies were slightly different\nthan in the presence of 25 mM NaCl, about 1648 and 1622 cm\u20131 (Figure 6D). In this case, the relative intensities\nof these two bands were also different, since it was found that they\nwere 68 and 32%, respectively. From this picture, it is quite obvious\nthat, in the presence of DMPG and at low NaCl concentration, the secondary\nstructure of dens25 is different from that at high NaCl concentration,\nand this one presents a similar pattern to that found in the presence\nof DMPC at both low and high salt concentration. Although aggregated\nstructures and helical and disordered structures are present in all\nsamples, the quantity of aggregated \u03b2 structures diminished\ndramatically; i.e., the relative amount of either helical or disordered\nor both increased in the presence of DMPG, a negatively charged phospholipid,\nand a low salt concentration.\n\nDENV NS2A protein is\nessential in the viral replication process,\nyet it is a poorly characterized highly hydrophobic protein and requires\nthe membrane to perform its functions. In this work, we have characterized\nits membrane active regions by using a NS2A derived peptide library\nand have identified several regions with different interacting capabilities.\nAdditionally, we have characterized a NS2A peptide, peptide dens25,\nwith interesting properties in the presence of membrane model systems\nwith different compositions. We conducted a thorough biophysical study\nto ascertain the membrane disrupting capability of this region by\nstudying the structural and dynamic features which might be relevant\nfor those interactions.\n\nWe have been able to distinguish 10\ndifferent regions with significant\nhydrophobicity and interfacial values in NS2A. One of these regions,\nregion b, showed increased and overlapping water-to-interface and\nwater-to-bilayer transfer free energies. We have also studied the\neffect of a NS2A peptide library on membrane leakage and two segments\nwith significant rupture capabilities were delineated, one segment\ndelimited by residues 25\u201341 corresponding to peptide 5 and\na long segment delimited by residues 103\u2013183 corresponding\nto peptides 18\u201329. Interestingly, peptide 5 overlapped with\nregion b and peptides 18\u201329 encompass a broad region where\nthe supposed transmembrane segments of NS2A reside. We also studied\nthe influence of the NS2A derived peptide library on the thermotropic\nproperties of phospholipid membranes and found several peptides (peptides\n2, 5, 10, and 12) which induced a noticeable effect on the cooperativity\nand the anisotropy of the phospholipids studied. Since peptide 5 presents\na distinctive pattern, elicits a significant leakage value, affects\nthe thermotropic behavior of both DMPC and DMPG, and has been proposed\nto bind to the membrane surface,23 we have\nselected the NS2A segment comprised by residues 30\u201355, peptide\ndens25, to characterize its effect on model membranes.\n\nPeptide\ndens25 bound extensively to model membranes composed of\nnegatively charged phospholipids, and its binding was apparently dependent\non membrane surface total charge, i.e., the more negative, the greater\nthe binding. The dens25 peptide affected membrane stability, resulting\nin the release of CF, this effect being dependent on the lipid/peptide\nmolar ratio and lipid composition. Interestingly, the highest CF release\nwas observed for liposomes containing negatively charged phospholipids,\nwhereas Chol induced lower leakage values. We have also shown that\ndens25 affected the steady state fluorescence anisotropy of DPH inserted\ninto membranes, especially when those membranes were composed of negatively\ncharged phospholipids. Significantly, the interaction of dens25 seemed\nto be of an electrostatic nature: the data indicated that the effect\nwas inversely proportional to the salt concentration in the medium.\nCalorimetric experiments further corroborated these results, with\npeptide dens25 affecting more significantly the phase transition of\nmembranes containing negatively charged phospholipids in the absence\nof salt, an effect that was significantly reduced when the ionic strength\nwas increased; i.e., the less salt concentration, the bigger the effect\ndens25 has on negatively charged phospholipids. These results were\nalso corroborated by the infrared analysis of the ester C=O\nstretching carbonyl band of the lipids. In the presence of low salt\nconcentrations, dens25 affected the phase transition of the negatively\ncharged molecule, DMPG, but not the zwitterionic one, DMPC. This interaction\nwas abolished when the peptide was in the presence of increased salt\nconcentrations.\n\nIn the infrared spectra of the amide I\u2032\nregion of the fully\nhydrated dens25 peptide in the presence of different phospholipids\nand at different temperatures, coexistence of unordered, aggregated,\nand helical structures was clearly seen. However, the relative proportion\nof secondary structures varied depending on phospholipid type and\nsalt concentration. In the presence of DMPG and at low NaCl concentration,\nthe secondary structure of dens25 was different from that at high\nNaCl concentration, and this one was similar to that found in the\npresence of DMPC at both low and high salt concentration. Although\naggregated structures and helical and disordered structures were present\nin all samples, the quantity of aggregated \u03b2 structures diminished\ndramatically; i.e., the relative amount of either helical or disordered\nor both increased if negative lipids were present and the salt concentration\nwas kept at low levels. The secondary structure of the dens25 peptide\nwas thus affected by its binding to the membrane, as it has been suggested\nfor other peptides.53,65 Concomitantly, differences in\nthe frequency of the carbonyl band of the phospholipids were observed,\nshowing that peptide binding modulates phospholipid conformation.\n\nTaking all of these results together, it is clear that this NS2A\nsegment interacts electrostatically with the membrane when negatively\ncharged phospholipids are present. The effect elicited by peptide\ndens25 should be primarily due to the electrostatic nature of the\nphospholipids, i.e., charge, with a slight contribution of hydrophobic\ninteractions. Interestingly, peptide dens25 affects membranes at distinct\nlevels, from the membrane surface down to the hydrophobic core. Its\nlocation should be at or near the membrane interface, affecting lipid\nfluidity, most probably having an in-plane orientation. Moreover,\nits interfacial properties suggest that this region could behave similarly\nto a pre-transmembrane domain partitioning into and interacting with\nthe membrane depending on the membrane composition and/or other proteins,\nshifting between membrane bound and unbound conformations and thus\naffecting its membrane topology.\n\nThe\nresults described in this work highlight an interesting and\nimportant domain in the DENV NS2A protein which, due to its capacity\nto modulate and affect membrane structure, might be essential in the\nDengue virus life cycle. Moreover, an understanding of NS2A and its\ninteraction with the membrane during the DENV replication cycle might\npave the way to pinpoint novel targets to address DENV infection."}
