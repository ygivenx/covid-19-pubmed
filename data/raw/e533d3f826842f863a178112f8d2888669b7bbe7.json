{"title": "Discovery of Novel Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors Through Development of a Protein-Based Pharmacophore", "body": "Signaling between cells in the central nervous system is mediated by the controlled release and reuptake of neurotransmitters in the synapse. 1 An excess or deficit of the monoamines serotonin, dopamine or norepinephrine in the synapse has been associated with various psychiatric and neurological disorders including depression, anxiety, compulsivity, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), substance abuse, Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Control of synaptic monoamine levels is affected by the plasma membrane monoamine transporters (MATs), which terminate the action of these biogenic amines via reuptake into the presynaptic cell. The mechanisms of action of drugs related to the above medical conditions typically involve the MAT proteins. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) such as imipramine (Tofranil \u2122 ), developed in the 1950s, alleviate depression by blocking serotonin and norepinephrine transporters (SERT and NET, respectively), thereby extending the lifespan of synaptic serotonin and norepinephrine. Unfortunately, the TCAs also block adrenergic, muscarinic acetylcholine and histamine receptors, responsible for a plethora of adverse effects. 8, 9 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the next generation of antidepressants led by fluoxetine (Prozac \u2122 ) in the 1980s, carry far fewer adverse effects compared to the TCAs. The SSRIs block SERT, but because the resultant surge of serotonin can activate any of 14 serotonin receptor types, this drug class is not without its own adverse effects. [10] [11] [12] The driving force for MAT uptake of monoamine substrate is electrogenic, harnessing the inward Na + gradient across the cell membrane. 13, 14 The SERT, NET and DAT (dopamine transporter) are members of the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter (NSS) family as well as members of a larger group of Na + and Cl \u2212 dependent transporters known as the \"solute carrier 6\" (SLC6) family. 15 The lack of a high-resolution 3-D MAT structure had hindered structure-function and therapeutic development efforts until a breakthrough was achieved in the form of crystallization of the bacterial NSS homolog LeuT, a leucine transporter. 16 The LeuT x-ray structure has provided a template to build credible MAT computational models. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] Although model quality increases with sequence identity with the template, structural similarity also plays a significant role.\n\nIn the absence of high-resolution 3D structures for SERT, development of a ligand based pharmacophore [22] [23] [24] [25] or QSAR [26] [27] [28] are feasible alternatives to obtain structural information about the binding pocket. Ligand-based approaches analyze a set of ligands and generate possible protein-ligand interaction patterns without knowledge of the protein structure. A limitation of ligand-based approaches is that flexible alignment using dissimilar scaffolds is less reliable; knowledge of the bioactive conformation of at least one active molecule significantly improves alignment accuracy. 29 These limitations can be overcome by using structure-based approaches, in which diverse scaffolds can be used to capture ligand interactions and the binding pocket environment in general. Docking, a structure-based technique, is capable of reliably predicting the bioactive conformation for a co-crystallized ligand. 30 In the absence of an experimental 3D structure, however, a reasonable 3D model can be constructed for a receptor using crystallographic or NMR data from genetically and functionally related proteins. 31, 32 Comparative modeling correctly predicts the 3D fold of a protein in most cases and has often provided insight into the atomistic details of ligand binding. 33, 34 Models created by this method have identified potential binding pockets, and have been employed for docking, structure-based pharmacophore generation and virtual screening (VS) to identify new ligands and their interactions with the protein. 33, 35, 36 Pharmacophore models, defined as a 3D collection of features essential for bioactivity of a ligand, have been widely employed. 37, 38 The approach of combining a pharmacophore with VS has yielded novel structural scaffolds for ligands of a target receptor. [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] Application of this technique with the DAT led to the identification of structurally novel VS \"hit\" compounds which, upon further modification, created a more potent analog through rational drug design. 33, 43, 45 The present work describes the development of a structure-based pharmacophore and its VS utilization to identify novel ligand structural scaffolds that display SERT selectivity.\n\nFour discrete amino acid sequence alignments with LeuT were generated that primarily differed in the loop regions. Manual refinement of the alignments was conducted to remove gaps within the TM regions. Rotamers of the residue side chains lining the hSERT halogenbinding pocket were selected based on their ability to form a sub-pocket, as these residues have been reported to be important for binding of certain SSRIs. 21 A total of 80 SERT homology models were built using Discovery Studio (DS) 2.5.1. Five models from each alignment (20 models total) having the lowest discrete optimized protein energy (DOPE) score were chosen for further evaluation. DOPE is an atomistic-based statistical potential for model evaluation and structure prediction. This conformational energy measure reflects the stability of a model relative to other models generated. 46 The models were also deposited into the PDB evaluation server and assessed with respect to stereochemical quality. 47 (accessed Sep 30, 2010) The plots generated by the server were evaluated for unusual phi-psi angles, bond lengths, bond angles and van der Waals contacts. Two models were selected for further evaluation, specifically their fitness in a 3D environment assessed by Profiles-3D. This DS module assesses the protein's tertiary structure compatibility with its sequence. Finally, spatial overlap of the model and template polypeptide backbone atoms was examined to check the integrity of the model's TM domains and the volume of its binding pocket. On this basis, \"Model 1\" was chosen for further studies.\n\nThe MOE alpha site finder was used to identify possible ligand sites in Model 1. A site exposed to the extracellular space was chosen based on evidence for inhibitors binding in this vestibule. 21 A sphere with a radius of 8 \u00c5 was created to constrain the resulting docked poses, in keeping with recent reports. 18, 21 The combination of proxy triangle as the placement method and force field refinement with an affinity scoring function yielded MOE docking poses of leucine into LeuT with an RMSD of 0.31 \u00c5 (data not shown). This strategy was next used to dock each of 16 structurally diverse antidepressants (Figure 1) , possessing a large range of SERT binding affinities (0.1 nM -9100 nM). It is acknowledged that certain SSRI ligands used in the docking have been reported to access the interior S1 substrate pocket 48 ; however, the VS pocket employed in this study contained elements of the vestibular (S2 substrate) pocket and the halogen binding pocket (HBP) (Figure 2A ). The latter pocket is defined in part by hSERT residues Leu-99 (TM 1), Trp-103 (TM 1) and Ile-179 (TM 3). The ligand-accessible region of the HBP (green cloud) is adjacent to that of the S2 pocket (orange cloud) ( Figure 2A) ; the HBP appears to be important for recognition of halogen-containing inhibitors. Poses in which the halogen atom of the ligand was directed toward this pocket were thus favored. A consensus was developed by overlaying the highest-ranked poses to generate a \"common interaction pattern\".\n\nResidues identified as common interaction points were then chosen to develop a 3D pharmacophore ( Figure 2B ). Pharmacophore feature F1 of radius 1 \u00c5 was created midway between Arg-104 (TM 1) and Glu-493 (TM 10) to capture possible ionic or H-bond interactions, particularly with protonated ligand nitrogen atoms. Previous reports of SERTbased pharmacophore models indicated the importance of a positively charged nitrogen atom. 49, 50 Feature F2 (radius 1 \u00c5) was created in the vicinity of Lys-490 (TM 10) to capture possible H-bond interactions. The lysine side chain is among the more flexible of the naturally occurring amino acids; 78 rotamers were possible for Lys-490. The rotamer oriented toward the vestibular pocket, analogous to Asp-401 in LeuT, was chosen to capture possible interactions with ligands. Asp-401 is reported to interact with different antidepressants in LeuT crystal structures 21 ; thus, Lys-490 would be expected to play a similar role in hSERT. Feature F3 (radius 1 \u00c5) was created to capture H-bond or cation-\u03c0 interactions with Tyr-107 (TM 1). Residues 104-106 of hSERT TM 1b are analogous to LeuT residues 30-32, although hSERT Tyr-107 and LeuT Val-33 differ substantially regarding the nature of potential ligand interactions. Feature F4 (radius 1.5 \u00c5) in the HBP was designed for hydrophobic interactions believed to be important in recognizing SSRIs. Residues lining the pocket are conserved between hSERT and LeuT. 21 Substitution of the hSERT TM 3 residue Ile-179 (Ile-111 in LeuT) with alanine, phenylalanine or aspartic acid increased SSRI substrate uptake inhibition potency by 7 -1080 fold. 21 The TM 1 mutations Ala77Gly in hNET and Ala81Gly in hDAT were observed to improve SSRI affinity, suggesting a negative influence of the methyl side chain of alanine on SSRI binding. Finally, an exclusion volume was added to make the pharmacophore more stringent and selective.\n\nApproximately one million members of the ZINC small molecule structural library database 51 were screened with the hSERT pharmacophore for possible \"hit\" compounds (those predicted to be SERT ligands). A total of 4097 molecules were acceptable to the pharmacophore filter. Docking of this subset into the SERT model followed by monitoring of affinity dG scores with visual inspection of the resulting poses yielded 68 preferred compounds. Due to lack of availability, only ten of the top 15 compounds (labelled SM-1 to SM-15) were initially tested for hSERT, hDAT or hNET affinity in single point in vitro binding assays. Two compounds, SM-10 and SM-11, at 10 \u03bcM significantly displaced the cocaine analog [ 125 I]-RTI-55 from hSERT membranes, indicating measurable hSERT affinity. At the same final concentration, these two compounds did not displace the radioligand at hDAT or hNET cells. SM-14, curiously, displaced [ 125 I]-RTI-55 at hDAT cells alone (Figure 3) . A DAT binding affinity K i value of 15.6 \u00b1 2.4 \u03bcM (mean \u00b1 s.e.m.) and a dopamine uptake inhibition potency IC 50 value of 10.5 \u00b1 4.6 \u03bcM were observed (manuscript in preparation). SM-10 and SM-11 were further characterized at hSERT HEK293 membranes in competition assays to obtain K i values for inhibition of [ 125 I]-RTI-55 binding. hSERT K i values of 38 \u00b1 17 \u03bcM and 17 \u00b1 7 \u03bcM were obtained for SM-10 and SM-11, respectively ( Figure 4 ). SM-10 and SM-11 were also screened for the ability to inhibit uptake of [ 3 H]-serotonin by intact hSERT HEK293 cells. Because no inhibition of [ 3 H]-serotonin uptake was detected at the 10 \u03bcM final concentration employed for these two VS hit compounds ( Figure 5 ), IC 50 values were not obtained. Given their structural flexibility ( Figure 6 ), SM-10 and SM-11 greatly differ from the SSRIs and TCAs that were employed to develop the pharmacophore.\n\nGiven the high sequence similarity (~ 50%, as calculated with BLAST) among the three-hMATs, finding a specific inhibitor that targets a single transporter is a challenging task. VS is more precarious with the additional inhibitor binding pocket uncertainty associated with a homology model built using a template sharing < 30% sequence identity ( Figure 7 ). Because of this handicap, and because the goal of the study was to identify SERT ligands of novel structural scaffold, a very high concentration of VS hit compound relative to the SERT ligand radiotracer (100,000-fold) was employed in the pharmacologic screen. The observation that most of the VS hits showed no ability to displace the radioligand at the SERT-HEK cells confirms that the huge molar ratio of VS compound:radiotracer was itself insufficient for decreasing radiotracer binding (i.e., some SERT affinity is required to register a response in this assay).\n\nThe two VS hits pharmacologically verified as SERT ligands displayed micromolar K i values. These binding affinities are very low compared to the nanomolar or better SERT affinities of certain SSRI therapeutics. Inhibition of serotonin uptake was not observed for any VS hit compound at the 10 \u03bcM screening concentration. Substrate uptake inhibition potency is often lower than binding affinity for a given MAT inhibitor, possibly due to differences in MAT conformational or population requirements for the two processes. 52, 53 The 10 \u03bcM SM-10 or SM-11 concentration employed may be above the threshold for detecting SERT ligand binding but below the threshold for detecting serotonin uptake inhibition.\n\nMicromolar affinities for VS hit compounds are common when homology models are employed. [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] From this research team, the first reported VS effort based on a DAT homology model yielded a hit compound (MI-4) with low micromolar DAT affinity and slightly better (high nanomolar) SERT affinity. Without modification, this compound displayed antipsychostimulant and antidepressant properties (Ref. 43 and unpublished data). The same VS effort using a DAT model yielded a hit compound (MI-17) with a SERT K i value of 284 nM. An MI-17 analog designed to increase SERT selectivity resulted in a compound with a SERT K i value of 37 nM, and SERT:DAT and SERT:NET selectivity ratios of 50 and over 200, respectively. 45 Thus, VS hit compounds with micromolar affinities appear to be useful as lead compounds for medication development.\n\nTo our knowledge this is the first study to identify novel SERT-selective reuptake inhibitors through VS performed with an hSERT homology model. Conventional drug development usually involves creation of analogs of established ligands for a given receptor. In contrast, the VS approach affords the possibility of discovering ligands with very different scaffolds, ligands that in all likelihood would never be otherwise identified for that receptor. In the case of the SERT, inhibitors of novel scaffold provide new opportunities for development of rationally designed multi-site drugs (e.g., SERT/5-HT 2A /5-HT 3 blockers) that address the therapeutic goal while mitigating the adverse effects associated with the SSRI drug class. It is anticipated that the two SM compounds described herein should serve as lead compounds toward the treatment of depression, anxiety, and other serotonin-related disorders. \n\nPolypeptide sequence retrieval and alignment-The FASTA sequence for human SERT was downloaded from the Uniprot database (accession number P31645). 62 The x-ray crystal structure of the Aquifex aeolicus protein LeuT (2a65) was used as a template and downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). 63 The template was checked for missing residues using the \"protein reports and utilities\" module in Discovery Studio (DS) 2.5.1. 64 Prior to modeling efforts, the missing residues Asn-133 and Ala-134 of the second extracellular loop (EL2) were built into the LeuT template and subjected to the DS loop refinement protocol. Different hSERT models were created using the Align2d methodology 65 and the three previously proposed sequence alignments. 16, 66, 67 hSERT Model 1: Manepalli et al. alignment (this article)-The sequences of hSERT and modified LeuT were aligned using the \"align sequence to templates\" protocol in DS. An alignment similar to Celik et al. 66 was generated, with minor manual modifications further increasing the sequence identity with LeuT ( Figure 7) . N-and C-terminal overhangs were deleted, increasing sequence identity to 24% and sequence similarity to 47%. The hSERT model sequence began at Arg-79 in the N-terminal tail and ended with Lys-605 in the Cterminal tail. The \"build homology model\" protocol in DS, which employs MODELLER version 9v4, 31 was used to construct 20 hSERT models. The models were further refined (see \"Model validation\") and ranked by discrete optimized protein energy 46 (DOPE) score. The model with the best DOPE score was designated \"Model 1\".\n\nhSERT Model 2: Beuming et al. alignment-The hSERT query sequence and modified LeuT were loaded into DS and aligned as described by Beuming et al. 67 Terminal residues not having the matching template coordinates at both ends were omitted, and 20 models were built and assigned DOPE scores as described above. Models based on this alignment resulted in EL2 positioned directly above the substrate permeation pore, which would likely have influenced ligand docking. The dangling EL2 was adjusted using the DS loop refinement protocol. Models were then evaluated using the \"verify protein\" protocol, which assesses the score of each residue in the known 3D environment. This was followed by superposition of the hSERT model onto LeuT to check for TM domain coincidence. The final version was designated \"Model 2\".\n\nhSERT Model 3: Yamashita et al. alignment-The hSERT query sequence and modified template were aligned as proposed by Yamashita et al. 16 N-and C-terminal overhangs were deleted, leaving 527 hSERT residues. The optimal model resulting from this alignment was designated as \"Model 3\".\n\nhSERT Model 4: Celik et al. alignment-Twenty hSERT models were built with DS as described above but following the proposed Celik et al. alignment 66 , which offered a sequence identity match comparable to the Manepalli alignment and greater than the Beuming and Yamashita alignments. A 527-residue hSERT polypeptide was used to develop \"Model 4\", as described for Model 1.\n\nFive models from each of the four alignment groups were chosen based on DOPE scores. The stereochemical quality of the preferred models was assessed with the validation server used to evaluate structures deposited into PDB. 46 From each group of five, two models were then chosen based on their having the fewest outliers on the phi-psi angle Ramachandran plot. These two models were evaluated for 3D fold, using the \"verify protein\" protocol in DS. This protocol reduces 3D structures to a simplified 1D representation, compares this to the 1D amino acid sequence, and assigns a score. This score is compared to the expected high and low scores for the sequence predicted from statistical analysis of high-resolution PDB structures.\n\nTM domain assembly and ligand binding pocket volume were checked by superposing the SERT models onto the LeuT model using MOE (Figure 8 ). 68 A single hSERT model was selected for each of the four groups. The all-atom force field AMBER99 69, 70 was used to add hydrogen atoms and partial charges to the models. Keeping the non-hydrogen atoms fixed in space, hydrogen atoms were minimized with a convergence criterion of 0.05 kcal/ mol. The final hSERT models chosen from each alignment were further optimized to minimize the outliers and avoid unnecessary protein contacts. Of the four models, Model 1 had the smallest RMSD on superposition with LeuT and maximal ligand binding pocket volume, similar to the LeuT.\n\nThe alpha site finder function of MOE 2008.09 was used to identify possible ligand binding sites in Model 1. The site finder is purely geometric; no energy terms are used. Alpha spheres within the hSERT model that were too exposed to solvent were eliminated; spheres that corresponded to locations of tight atomic packing in the model were retained. Spheres were classified as either \"hydrophobic\" or \"hydrophilic\" depending on the potential for hydrogen bonding. Following the default settings, alpha spheres were clustered to produce a collection of putative binding sites that are ranked according to the number of hydrophobic atoms within contact distance of the spheres. Finally, dummy atoms were created in the S1 and S2 pockets to specify the algorithm to dock the ligands.\n\nLigand coordinates were obtained from the small molecule crystal database CCSD (Cambridge Crystallographic Structural Database). 71, 72 Ligands having no coordinates were drawn using MOE. Partial charges and hydrogen atoms were added to all ligands using Merck Molecular Force Field 94X (MMFF94x). [73] [74] [75] Ligand geometry was optimized via energy minimization with a conjugated gradient truncated Newton optimization algorithm with convergence criteria = 0.01 kcal/mol, \u03b5 = 1. Leucine or selected TCA drugs were first docked with the LeuT model to test for consistency with the reported cocrystal structures. 16, 21 Atom placement methods including proxy triangle, alpha triangle and triangle matcher were employed, as were refinement techniques using grid-based and force field-based methods. The combination that produced poses very close to the crystal structure (<1\u00c5) was chosen for hSERT docking. Interaction plots for all docked poses of different antidepressants in hSERT were generated using the MOE ligand interaction module. 76 A consensus of residues and their predicted ligand interactions was developed and used in creating the pharmacophore features for the vestibular ligand-binding pocket.\n\nA pharmacophore feature was generated at each amino acid side chain -ligand interaction point obtained from initial docking iterations. Pharmacophore points F1, F2, F3 (each with a radius of 1 \u00c5) and F4 (radius = 1.5 \u00c5) were delineated to better encompass the hydrophobic features of the docked ligands. An excluded volume was created, and the algorithm assigned a penalty to poses that encroached on this space. The final pharmacophore product was tested using a database containing known hSERT ligands and decoy ligands. The pharmacophore model successfully discriminated the classic hSERT ligands from the decoys.\n\nAn 18 million entry \"all-purchasable\" subset of the ZINC database containing was downloaded. 51 The subset was \"washed\" by importing the collection into MOE, which removes unwanted salts, ions and disconnected molecular fragments from the database. The Lipinski's Rule of Five descriptor was applied to the database to remove nondrug-like molecules. 77 Compounds with reactive groups were removed by further screening the database using a toxic moiety descriptor. From this database a subset containing approximately one million compounds was selected for further use. Tautomers and protomers of these entries were generated at physiological pH. Using the \"import conformation\" module of MOE, different conformations were generated and minimized using the MMFF94x force field; conformations with strain energy 4 kcal/mol or more above the lowest energy conformation were discarded. This final database was screened using the 4-point pharmacophore. \"Hit\" compounds acceptable to the pharmacophore filter were further screened to ensure the presence of halogens and a molecular weight < 350 daltons, features common to most of the known antidepressants. These steps yielded a pool of 4,097 hit compounds. Three hSERT docking iterations were performed with this pool of structures. Affinity scores < \u22126.0 kcal/mol plus visual inspection was used to condense the pool to 68 candidate ligands. Of these, 10 of the top-ranked 15 compounds (coded \"SM-1\" through \"SM-15\") were procured from various sources and pharmacologically tested.\n\nIn vitro VS compound binding screen-Compounds identified from the virtual screen were purchased and dissolved in 100% DMSO to a concentration of 10 mM. Initial onepoint competition binding assays were conducted using 10 \u03bcM final concentration of VS hit compound and 0.1 nM of the radiolabeled cocaine analog [ 125 I]-RTI-55, a radioligand with high affinity at all three MATs. Stably transfected HEK293-hSERT membranes or N2A-hDAT or HEK293-hNET whole cells were employed for all binding assays. Non-specific binding was determined by inclusion of 10 \u03bcM paroxetine, mazindol or desipramine for hSERT, hDAT or hNET assays, respectively. Screening results were analyzed with one-way ANOVA (P < 0.05) with a post-hoc Dunnett's Multiple Comparison Test.\n\nhSERT membrane binding assay-hSERT binding affinities were obtained by displacement of [ 125 I]-RTI-55 in membrane binding assays. Membrane was prepared from stable hSERT-HEK cells grown at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO 2 environment on 150 \u00d7 25 mm plates. At 95% confluence (3 days of growth), cells were washed twice with 10 mL cold phosphatebuffered saline (DPBS). An additional 10 mL of DPBS was added and cells were harvested by scraping and transferred to cold centrifuge tubes (15 mL), followed by centrifuging for 10 min at low speed (700 \u00d7 g). After removal of the supernatant, the cell pellet was resuspended in 500 uL cold TE buffer (50 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5). Following centrifuging for 30 min at 100,000 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was frozen for later use or resuspended in ice-cold binding buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl). Each sample was analyzed for protein content using the Bradford protein assay. For competition binding, membrane was incubated with [ 125 I]-RTI-55 (0.1 nM concentration) and increasing concentrations of cold competitor (1 nM to 1 mM), or 10 \u03bcM paroxetine to measure non-specific binding. Reactions were carried out in 12 \u00d7 75 mm borosilicate glass tubes with gentle shaking at room temperature for 1 hour and terminated by rapid filtration through GF/B filters (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH) presoaked in 0.5% polyethylenimine solution (v/v). Filters were washed twice with 5 mL cold 50 mM Tris buffer and transferred to vials. Radioactivity was determined using a Beckman gamma counter. For saturation binding assays, data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 5.0 software. IC 50 values were generated and converted to K i values using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (K i = IC 50 /(1+ ([RTI-55]/K d RTI-55)). 78 hDAT and hNET whole cell binding assays-Whole-cell competition binding assays were performed for hDAT and hNET using stable hDAT-N2A or hNET-HEK293 cell lines, respectively, grown at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO 2 environment. Cell monolayers were grown in 24well plates to >90% confluence. Cells were washed twice with 1 mL of KRH buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 125 mM NaCl, 4.8 mM KCl, 1.3 mM CaCl 2 , 1.2 mM MgSO 4 , 1.2 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 5.6 mM glucose) supplemented with 50 mM ascorbic acid (KRH/AA). Cells were incubated for 15 minutes with 1 nM [ 125 I]-RTI-55 supplemented with tropolone (total volume of 500 uL) along with increasing concentrations of drug or 10 \u03bcM mazindol (hDAT) or 10 \u03bcM desipramine (hNET). Following incubation, cells were washed twice with 1 mL KRH/AA buffer, then treated with 1 mL 1% SDS with gentle shaking at room temperature for 1 hour. Cell lysates were transferred into vials. Radioactivity was determined using a Beckman gamma counter and analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 as described above.\n\nSerotonin uptake inhibition screen-One-point competition binding assays were performed using stably transfected HEK293-hSERT whole cells grown to >90% confluence on 24-well plates. Cells were washed with KRH buffer, then preincubated with 10 \u03bcM VS hit compound for 10 min, followed by addition of 10 nM [ 3 H]-serotonin. After an additional 5 min, cells were washed twice, then treated with 1% SDS and shaken for 1 hr. Lysates were transferred to 5 mL scintillation fluid and radioactivity was detected using a Beckman liquid scintillation counter. Non-specific radioligand uptake was determined in the presence of 10 \u03bcM clomipramine. Chemical structures of SERT inhibitors used to develop the pharmacophore.
