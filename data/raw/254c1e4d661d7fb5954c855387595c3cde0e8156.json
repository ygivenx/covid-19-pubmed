{"title": "Environmental contamination of the SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare premises: An urgent call for protection for healthcare workers", "body": "An outbreak of COVID-19 began in Wuhan, China in early December 2019 and is ongoing. There have been 80,955 confirmed COVID-19 cases, and 3,162 deaths in China as of March 11, 2020. 1 Early on during the COVID-19 outbreak, healthcare workers (HCW) were found to beat high risk of developing COVID-19, even when infection prevention measures were in place, including usage of personal protective equipment (PPE: eye protection/face shield, respiratory protection, isolation gowns, and gloves), hand hygiene, and patient placement in negative-pressure isolation rooms. Thus far, 1,688 HCWs have become infected with SARS-CoV-2 in China, including 1,080 HCW cases in Wuhan where the outbreak started. 2, 3 However, the World Health Organization (WHO) indicates that many of the newer cases of HCW infection have stemmed from household exposures. 4 The COVID-19 outbreak caused a sudden, significant increase in hospital visits from infected and suspected individuals over the course of two months. 5, 6 The large patient surge overwhelmed hospitals, despite continuous efforts to expand hospital capacity. Hospital waiting times were extended, which increased the time before infected individuals were identified and placed into isolation.\n\nIt is believed that the primary transmission mode of COVID-19 is through large respiratory droplets and close contact, although there is limited data that indicates that it may also spread through indirect contact with contaminated environments and aerosols. 4 Only one study has examined possible environmental contamination of SARS-CoV-2 in a hospital outside of the epicenter of Wuhan and it consisted of a small sample size. 7 Characterizing hospital contamination of SARS-CoV-2 is critical because hospitals have experienced massive patient surges during the outbreak and environmental contamination may contribute to disease spread. 8 Data regarding the hospital function zones with highest levels of contamination can inform hospital cleaning and disinfection protocols to reduce the risk of healthcare-associated disease.\n\nThe purposes of this study were to: (1) determine the extent to which the hospital environment becomes .

Historically, Wuhan has been the biggest hub in China for land, water, and air transportation, and it is also one of the most industralized cities in China. 10 The Zhongnan Medical Center possesses a Grade-III rating, the highest level according to a 3-tier system in China that recognizes a hospital's capacity and ability to provide healthcare, conduct research, and deliver education. It has over 3,300 beds and a medical team that includes over 500 senior physicians. It includes 46 clinical departments and multiple research and clinical laboratories.\n\nSamples were collected between February 7 -February 27, 2020, while the outbreak was ongoing. Three sets of surface samples were collected using dacron swabs across major hospital function zones, hospital equipment/objects and medical supplies, and HCW's used PPE. Swab samples were also collected from control areas (i.e., spaces that did not house COVID-19 patients, consisting of administrative areas and the parking lot). Dacron swabs were premoistened with cell preservation solution. Samples were shipped with ice packs and refrigerated upon arrival at the laboratory. Blank controls were also used in swab sampling. Medical equipment assessed consisted of finger clips of pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram monitors, oxygen cylinders, oxygen regulators, oxygen masks, CT scanning machine, centrifuge, .

Objects in non-medical areas (i.e., public facilities) assessed consisted of elevator buttons, microwave ovens, faucets, handrails, and hair drier. HCW's' used PPE assessed included gloves, eye protection or face shield and hand sanitizer dispensers; samples were collected after the HCW performed their duties with a COVID-19 patient. Hospital areas were classified into contamination zones, based on the percentage of swabs that were positive in that area/object.\n\nReverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) were conducted, using procedures recommended by the Chinese \n\nThe R software (version 3.5.1) was used for all analyses. First, descriptive statistics were conducted.\n\nDifferences in the positive detection rates of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the surface swabs between hospital areas, hospital objects and medical supplies, and HCW's used PPE were assessed using Chi-Square tests and/or the Fisher's exact test where appropriate based on cell size. Two-tailed tests were used, and Pvalues smaller than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\nIn total, 626 hospital environmental surface swab samples were collected; 13.6% were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1 ). There were significant differences in the percentage of positive samples found across different hospital areas (P < .01). The most contaminated zones were the intensive care unit (ICU) that specialized in caring for NCP patients (31.9%), the Obstetric Isolation Ward focusing .

CZ II included the Outpatient Lobby (16.7% positive samples), Emergency Department (12.5%), Office and Preparation Area of the Isolation Ward for NCP patients (12.2%), Obstetric Ward (12.1%), and Clinical Laboratories (11.5%). CZ I included the Fever Clinics (6.5% positive samples), CT Examination Room (5.6%), and General Ward (5.5%). Both the Administrative Area and Parking Lot were classified as CZ 0.\n\nAmong all examined commonly used hospital objects and medical equipment, 13.9% were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 ( Table 2 ). This included positive samples from self-service printers (20%, it is a machine commonly used in China by patients themselves to print out their examination or test reports in a hospital), desktops (16.8%), doorknobs (16.0%), and telephones (12.5%), medical equipment (12.5%), and public facilities (8%). Only 5.6% of samples collected from walls and floors were positive. The most contaminated objects were self-service printers (20%), desktops/keyboards (16.8%), and doorknobs (16%).\n\nOf the samples collected from HCWs' used PPE (hand sanitizer dispensers, gloves, and eye protector/face shield), 12.9% were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Table 3 ). Significant differences were found in the percentage of positive samples across the PPE types (P < .01). The highest positive detection rate found was from the hand sanitizer dispensers 20.3%; 15.4% and 1.7% of gloves and eye protection or face shields tested positive, respectively (Table 3) .\n\nThis investigation showed that the hospital environment frequently becomes contaminated when providing care to COVID-19 patients. Contaminated areas/items included patient care areas housing COVID-19 patients, common hospital objects/items, such as self-service printers, desktops, doorknobs, and keyboards, medical equipment, and HCWs' PPE, such as gloves, eye protection, and face shields.\n\n.

It is noteworthy that the hospital surface samples were collected from February 7 to February 27, 2020, which was after human-to-human spread of SARS-CoV-2 was identified. It is plausible to assume that the hospital surface contamination would have been more severe before the sampling period, when environmental cleaning protocols were not as extensive and isolation practices that should be implemented rapidly. In addition, pregnant women and neonates are highly susceptible populations. They are more sensitive to the chemicals released by the internal infection control processes. It is, therefore, a standardize procedure to lessen the intensity and to reduce frequency of the internal infection control processes in the department, which may have led to the high positive detection rates discovered from our study. It was not surprising that the Fever Clinic had a low positive detection rate for SARS-CoV-2 (6.5%). Early on, the Fever Clinic was relocated to a semi-open area, .

In addition, unlike the obstetric isolation ward, strict infection prevention measures were instituted in the Fever Clinic. These practices likely led to the low positive detection rate.\n\nIt is notable that both hand sanitizer dispensers and HCWs' used gloves possessed the highest positive detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 compared to eye protection or face shields. Gloves would become contaminated by touching infected patients and/or contaminated surfaces in the hospital. Eye protection and face shields would likely become contaminated by infected patients' respiratory droplets or infectious aerosols (if produced by COVID-19) , or by the HCWs' own hands during donning or doffing. This study's data supports the idea that contaminated gloves or hands may be a possible exposure route for SARS-CoV-2. Patients and visitors usually do not wear gloves in hospital settings. Contaminated hands and surfaces could potentially lead to SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Hospitals should emphasize the critical role of hand hygiene as a way to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nThis study has several limitations. SARS-CoV-2 culture samples were not collected; thus, exact bioburden levels were unable to be determined. No air samples were collected during the investigation.\n\nThis study focused on hospital surface contamination of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs as a surrogate of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. We were limited in our ability to characterize other exposure factors, such as other exposure routes, frequencies, and duration. A lack of resources also meant that we were unable to conduct 1 3 These findings emphasize the need to ensure adequate environmental cleaning, strengthen infection prevention training, and improve infection prevention precautions among HCWs during the outbreak of COVID-19.\n\n.
