{"title": "Systematic annotation and analysis of \"virmugens\" -virulence factors whose mutants can be used as live attenuated vaccines NIH Public Access Author Manuscript $watermark-text $watermark-text $watermark-text", "body": "A live attenuated vaccine contains a live attenuated pathogen that has one or more gene mutations from its wild type pathogen and is able to induce protection in a host. Therefore, live attenuated vaccines have two common traits: (i) attenuated virulence to a host, and (ii) induction of protective immunity in the host against a challenge with a virulent pathogen. The gene mutation is required to attenuate the virulence of the live pathogen, making the vaccine relatively safe for the vaccinated host. Live attenuated vaccines may still grow inside the host, but the growth is greatly limited. To make the attenuated vaccine live allows the attenuated vaccine strain infect the host in a pathway that is often similar to the virulent parent pathogen. This way the vaccine most likely stimulates strong cellular and antibody responses as well as some time of immunity, which can be short term, long term or lifelong. One difference between virulent pathogen infection and vaccination is that after a host is infected with a virulent wild type pathogen, the survived host is normally resistant to any reinfection, and the protective immune response in the host usually lasts for life. However, the immunity resulting from vaccination with a live attenuated vaccine is often short lived although a lifelong immunity may sometimes be induced. However, the exact differences between live attenuated vaccines and their virulent wild type strains in terms of immune response inductions are typically unclear.\n\nThe mutations generated in live attenuated vaccines are on genes encoding for virulence factors. Virulence factors are the various parts of a pathogen that allow the microbe to infect, survive, and replicate in the host [1] . While all live attenuated vaccines contain mutations in one or more virulence factors, not all virulence factors can be mutated to create a live attenuated vaccine. A mutation of a virulence factor in a virulent pathogen will typically lead to attenuation. However, the mutation of a virulence factor may not generate a stable attenuated microbe, or the attenuated strain does not stimulate protective immune response in the host against virulent infection. For simplicity, we have coined the term \"virmugen\" to represent those virulence factors that can be mutated in wild type virulent pathogens for generation of live attenuated vaccines that stimulate protective immunity against virulent pathogen infections. In our definition, the \"live attenuated vaccines\" do not have to be licensed vaccines. A live attenuated vaccine can be any vaccine candidate that is live, attenuated, and proven effective to induce protection against virulent pathogen infection in a vaccination-challenge experiment using a well-established laboratory animal model [2, 3] .\n\nFor several decades researchers have been developing live attenuated vaccines, but systematic analysis of virmugens has not been performed. To address this, we have developed VirmugenDB (http://www.violinet.org/virmugendb), a web-based virmugen database for collecting and analyzing various virmugens. VirmugenDB stores manually curated virmugens and associated information (e.g., corresponding live attenuated vaccines) from peer-reviewed journals. The collection and analysis of virmugens are important for rational and efficient development of future live attenuated vaccines against the infections of existing and emerging pathogens.\n\nVirmugenDB is implemented using a three-tier architecture built on two HP servers which run the Redhat Linux operating system (Redhat Enterprise Linux ES 5). Users can submit database or analysis queries through the web. These queries are then processed using PHP/ SQL (middle-tier, application server based on Apache) against a MySQL (version 5.0) relational database (back-end, database server). The result of each query is then presented to the user in the web browser. Two servers are scheduled to regularly backup each other's data. VirmugenDB is a new integrated program of the comprehensive VIOLIN vaccine database and analysis system [4] . Figure 1 demonstrates the VirmugenDB database design and workflow. Each virmugen is annotated with evidence from peer-reviewed references. VirmugenDB also includes general information about individual virmugens such as gene name, pathogen strain name, sequences, and 3D structures. VirmugenDB incorporates many software programs that provide predicted results and tools for sequence analysis (Figure 1 ).\n\nA semi-automatic approach is used in virmugen curation and analysis (Figure 1 and Supplemental Figure 1 ). Manual curation of peer-reviewed journal articles emphasizes the retrieval of specific virmugen information and experimental evidence. In order to determine whether or not a gene is a virmugen, experimental evidence must demonstrate attenuation in a host as well as protection from the virulent parent in a challenge study. To improve the efficacy of manual curation, an in-house web-based literature mining and curation system called Limix was used [5, 6] . The interactive Limix data submission and review system: (a) allows a curator to search literature, copy and edit text, and submit data to database, and (b) provides a data reviewer tools to review, edit, and approve the curated data on one comprehensive web interface. A version control and manage system stores different versions of editions and allows a reviewer to compare history versions to trace the detailed changes. Only after approval by a domain expert, the data can be posted publicly (Supplemental Figure 1 ). The authors and other curators in the team check frequently for possibly new virmugens from published papers in PubMed, and add experimentally verified virmugens to the VirmugenDB. After approval by a domain expert, curated new virmugens from the database will be published in the VirmugenDB website and available for the public to query. We plan to regularly update the customized virmugen BLAST library and the data download site 2-3 times a year.\n\nDifferent automatic approaches were also developed. Using manually curated PubMed ID, NCBI gene ID (or protein ID or nucleotide ID), or an ID from Protein Data Bank (PDB; www.rcsb.org/), our programs in Limix are able to automatically retrieve detailed citation content, gene and protein information (e.g., sequences, names, functions), and 3D structure information, respectively, from different databases. The information is then stored in the VirmugenDB and seamlessly integrated with other content of a specific virmugen ( Figure 1 and Supplemental Figure 1 ).\n\nTo facilitate virmugen-associated sequence analysis, two customized BLAST libraries were generated. One library contains the protein sequences of all virmugens, and the other collects all the DNA sequences of all virmugens. Based on the customized virmugens libraries, a customized BLAST program is generated and allows a user to compare a custom protein or DNA sequence with all sequences collected in the VirmugenDB database.\n\nThe AroA protein sequences from 11 bacteria (see Supplemental Table 1 for detailed bacterial strain and protein ID information) were aligned with ClustalW2 [7] . The MEGA 4.0 package [8] was used to generate a phylogenetic tree structure for these 11 AroA proteins. Specifically, the sequences of these11 AroA proteins were first aligned using the ClustalW program within the MEGA4 software. The phylogenetic tree of these proteins was generated using a Neighbor Joining method [9] . Bootstrap analysis using 500 repetitions provided support for individual nodes [10] .\n\nAll data in VirmugenDB are freely available for public queries. The query interface was generated using PHP and HTML. Any query is submitted to the Virmugen MySQL relational database through a SQL query program. The results are returned to the browser in a user-friendly format.\n\nThe information of virmugens in VirmugenDB was stored in the Vaccine Ontology (VO; http://www.violinet.org/vaccineontology) [11, 12] . Developed based on the Web Ontology Language (OWL) format (http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/), the VO content can be processed by software programs and used to support automated reasoning and Semantic Web applications [13] . An example of virmugen representation in VO is demonstrated in Supplemental Figure 2 . All virmugen DNA and protein sequence data are freely downloadable in FASTA format from the VirmugenDB website (http://www.violinet.org/ virmugendb).\n\nCurrently, VirmugenDB has included 225 virmugens as well as 196 virmugen-related vaccines. Based on the results from vaccination-challenge experiments, these virmugens have individually been verified to be valid for development of protective live attenuated vaccines against 57 bacterial, viral, and protozoan pathogens. It is noted that a majority of the virmugens stored in the database are identified from peer-reviewed literature papers that introduce the development and evaluation of effective live attenuated vaccines using established laboratory animal models. Most of these vaccines are not licensed vaccines. However, each vaccine candidate used in our analysis was proven effective to protect against virulent pathogen challenge in at least one vaccination-challenge experiment.\n\nBelow we will analyze these data based on the pathogen categories.\n\nIn total we have 159 bacterial virmugens for 29 bacterial pathogens. Out of these bacterial virmugens, many \"aro\", \"pur\", and \"gua\" genes are found (Supplemental Table 1 ).\n\nThe \"aro\" genes in many pathogens have been mutated to develop protective live attenuated vaccines (Supplemental Table 1 ). Specifically, 11 aroA, three aroC, and two aroD genes have been mutated and proven to be virmugens. Live attenuated vaccines have been generated by mutating aroA in 11 strains belonging to eight genus such as Bordetella [14] , Pasteurella [15] , Salmonella [16] , Shigella [17] , Staphylococcus [18] , and Yersinia [19] . Except Gram-positive S. aureus, all other pathogens are Gram-negative. The mutation of aroC or aroD has also been used for developing live attenuated vaccines for four pathogens including Salmonella [20] , Shigella [21] , Burkholderia [22] , and Edwardsiella [23] . Bacterial aroA, aroC, and aroD genes code for 3-phosphoshikimate 1carboxyvinyltransferase, chorismate synthase, 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase, respectively. The \"aro\" genes are important to produce aromatic metabolites, mainly aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. If an \"aro\" gene is mutated, the mutant will be unable to synthesize aromatic amino acids and cannot replicate within a host in which aromatic compounds are not freely available. In addition, aro mutants often have a defect in cell envelope biosynthesis [24] .\n\nTo better identify the similarities and differences between experimentally verified aroA virmugens, the AroA protein sequences were aligned and the phylogram among these proteins was generated using ClustalW2 ( Figure 2) . The multiple sequence alignment shows more sequence similarities of AroA proteins among Gram-negative bacteria than the comparison between Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive S. aureus (Figure 2A ). The pairwise scores (i.e., the number of identities between the two sequences, divided by the length of the alignment) are equal to or greater than 50% between all Gram-negative bacteria. However, all pairwise scores between the AroA protein sequences of S. aureus and Gram-negative bacteria are between 22% and 26%. Although different pairwise scores were found, all AroA proteins from different bacteria share the same function. In the phylogram generated with AroA protein sequences, S. aureus is the root of the tree and significantly distant from all other Gram-negative bacteria ( Figure 2B ), suggesting the evolutionary difference between the same proteins from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.\n\nMany bacterial \"pur\" genes (including purC-F, and purK-N) and \"gua\" genes (including guaA and guaB) have been used for generating live attenuated vaccines (Supplemental Table 1 ). The \"pur\" gene products catalyze reactions involved in purine biosynthesis. Two of the four bases in nucleic acids, adenine and guanine, are purines. Nucleotides serve as not only a structural unit of DNA and RNA, but also a key component in signaling and metabolism. Bacterial \"gua\" gene encodes for GMP synthase or inosine 5\u2032-monophosphate dehydrogenase, which participate in the synthesis of guanosine monophosphate (GMP) [25] .\n\nAs a bacterium use case study, we analyzed all curated virmugens in Brucella spp. (Table 1) . Brucella is a facultative, Gram-negative bacterium that causes zoonotic brucellosis in humans and different animal species. Approximately 500,000 new human brucellosis cases are reported annually worldwide, making brucellosis one of the most common zoonotic disease in the world [26] . In total, 12 live attenuated Brucella vaccines generated using 15 virmugens have been found to deliver protective immunity ( Table 1) . Two of the 15 Brucella virmugens are purE and purK that involve nucleotide transport and metabolism and have been described above. Four Brucella virmugens (manA, manB, pgk, and pgm) encode for carbohydrate transport and metabolism proteins. Carbohydrates play an important role in various biological processes including energy storage and DNA and RNA structure buildup. Omp25 and Omp31, two virmugen proteins, involve in cell membrane biogenesis. Five Brucella virmugens are cytoplasmic proteins, three are cytoplasmic membrane proteins, two outer membrane proteins, two periplasmic proteins, and three with unknown subcellular locations (Table 1 ).\n\nIn total we have 54 viral virmugens for 24 viral pathogens. Three groups of viral virmugens have more than one gene: TK/UL23, glycoproteins, and matrix proteins ( Table 2) . Thymidine kinase (TK or UL23) is mutated in several herpes viruses infecting different host species including humans [27] , horse [28] , swine [29] , cat [30] , and chicken [31] . Thymidine kinase is an enzyme important in DNA repair, replication, and nucleotide metabolism [32] . This kinase is responsible for phosphorylation of deoxythymidine in the pathway of DNA synthesis [33] . Many glycoprotein genes from 10 viruses have been mutated for generating live attenuated viral vaccines (Table 2) . A glycoprotein is a class of proteins that have a carbohydrate group attached [34] . Glycoproteins are frequently found in membranes and help a virus bind to the host cell. M2 and M2-2, two matrix proteins, have also been identified to be virmugen proteins in influenza virus, human metapneumovirus, and human respiratory syncytial virus ( Table 2 ). The M protein is crucial in the formation of extracellular virus particles [35] . Viral matrix proteins mediate the regulatory switch from transcription to RNA replication and act late in infection by inhibiting viral transcription and up-regulating RNA replication [36] . Therefore, mutation of a matrix protein gene would reduce the viral pathogenesis by reducing viral replication and late infection capabilities of viruses. The mutation of this protein is only effective for RNA viruses, and DNA viruses do not have the equivalent of an M protein in RNA viruses.\n\nOnly 12 protozoan virmugens were identified, and no genes are orthologs (Supplemental Table 2 ). Several virmugens are cell membrane proteins or involve in nutrient metabolism, Py52 and UIS3 are two membrane proteins from Plasmodium yoelii. Membrane bound proteins could aid in attachment or invasion of host cells. Mic2 from Toxoplasma gondii, is a transmembrane adhesion protein that alters the protozoan's ability to invade the host cell [37] . Orotidine monophosphate decarboxylase (OMPDC) and uridine phosphorylase (UP), two proteins from T. gondii, are involved in pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism.\n\nTo study host responses induced by live attenuated vaccines, a comparative meta-analysis of results published in different papers has been performed. Host response comparison varied greatly across papers in different studies, ranging from comparison with na\u00efve control subjects, control subjects infected with the wild type pathogen, to comparison with more specific treatments such as other vaccines. When na\u00efve subjects were compared with host or host cells infected with a live attenuated vaccine, every regulation case was almost an up regulation of the host gene in comparison to the controls.\n\nThe most interesting comparison was with subjects infected with the wild type pathogen. Out of the 47 cases of host gene regulation that was compared to infection with the wild type, 18 cases (38%) were down regulated (Table 3) . Two genes with particularly significant patterns in regulation are interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and interleukin 4 (IL-4). Both of these were mostly down-regulated, with IFN-gamma down-regulated by 7 virmugens (6 vaccines) and IL-4 down-regulated by 4 virmugens (4 vaccines). In contrast, only one virmugen (sigE) mutant of M. tuberculosis up-regulated the production of IFN-\u03b3 from lung [38] . The production of IL-4 was not updated by any virmugen. The productions of IL-6, IL-10, TNF\u03b1, and IgG were up-or down-regulated in the infected hosts depending on the virmugens and pathogen targeted. For example, compared to host infected with virulent parent strains, IL-6 was down-regulated in live attenuated F. tularensis FTL0552 mutant, but up-regulated in an E. coli and a Salmonella mutant. Interestingly, TNF-\u03b1 was down-regulated in a M. tuberculosis adD26 mutant but up-regulated in M. tuberculosis sigE mutant. These suggest that TNF-\u03b1 can be up-or down-regulated in live attenuated mutant vaccines for the same pathogen.\n\nThe virmugen data collected in VirmugenDB are freely available for download and exchange as described in the Methods section. The manually curated and pre-computed VirmugenDB data can be efficiently queried and visualized (Supplemental Figure 3A-D) . Customized BLAST sequence analysis is also provided (Supplemental Figure 3E ).\n\nFor a specific vaccine research and development laboratory, the selection of a pathogen gene to mutate for the purpose of generating a live attenuated vaccine is usually ad hoc without systematic understanding of what will happen. However, as identified in this study, many virmugens encode for proteins involving in basic amino acid, carbohydrate, and nucleotide transport and metabolism, or cell membrane formation (e.g., viral glycoproteins). The virulence of these mutants is decreased inside host due to their reduced capability of binding to/infecting host cells or replicating inside host. However, protective immunity can still be induced.\n\nIt is still unclear why mutating a particular virmugen mutant causes specific host gene response. When IFN-gamma and IL-4 were down-regulated, many papers simply stated that because the virmugen mutant vaccine was attenuated, the mutant induced less inflammation and therefore a less robust immune response [39, 40] . On the other hand, papers that described up-regulation of host genes hypothesized that because the vaccine was protective, it makes sense that a more robust immune response would occur in host infected with a live attenuated vaccine [38, 41, 42] . Our meta-analysis results show up-or down-regulation of the same host genes may occur in different virmugen mutants of the same pathogen (Table  3 ). More research needs to be done on specific virmugens and how they react with the host in order to figure out why the host responds in a certain way when the virmugens are mutated.\n\nNumerous Omics data associated with host responses to virulent pathogens and live attenuated vaccines have been published and available online. Although the large amount of Omics data is available, many Omics data have noise and require additional experiments for verification. Therefore, our database will include only those experimentally verified host gene responses. Those Omics data analysis results without experimental verifications will not normally be included our database. However, the Omics data may be very helpful for generating new hypotheses and knowledge. The combination of the experimentally verified results and Omics data analysis will help further advancing the analysis of host genes specifically related to protective immunity.\n\nTo explain how virmugen mutants can function as live attenuated vaccines, we have developed a \"virmugen working model\" (Figure 3 ). This model suggests that compared to the wild type virulent parent strain, a virmugen mutant may stimulate a specific host gene response associated with the induction of protective immunity or successful host defense activity that results in the killing of the attenuated vaccine strain. On the other hand, a series of the host responses against virulent parent strain may be associated with pathological processes that lead to the outcome of a specific disease. It is crucial to differential different sets of host responses to wild type virulent parent strain and virmugen mutants.\n\nIn order to have a clearer understanding of how these virmugens and mutants function with respect to the host immune system, a majority of the live attenuated vaccines found in VirmugenDB have a mutation in a single gene. The single gene criterion was purposeful, as it allows for examination and analysis of the true function of that particular gene within host infection and immune response. In many cases, live attenuated vaccines are created through multigenic mutations. However, with multiple genes mutated, it is often difficult to determine how these genes are interacting with each other or their individual roles in infection and immunity. Therefore, VirmugenDB prefers to collect virmugens whose corresponding vaccines include only single gene mutations. Occasionally those live attenuated vaccines with multigenic mutations were included as evidence for obtaining and justifying new virmugens. In these cases, a careful annotation was taken to ensure that each gene was mutated as a virulence factor. Also, it should be noted that virulence is usually multigenic with different virulence factors working together. The mutation of one gene may disrupt a pathogenesis pathway involving many virulence factors. Sometimes a deletion of a single virulence factor may not lead to obvious decrease of virulence, probably due to the presence of an alternative pathway(s) in the pathogen. In this case, a simultaneous deletion of two or even more virulence factors may be required to achieve the status of attenuation.\n\nIt is common that an attenuated vaccine candidate does not provide significant protection. This was the case with a manBA mutant from Brucella abortus [43] , an ofs mutant from Streptococcus suis [44] , and 3abc and 7ab mutant in Feline Infectious Peritonitis [45] . The failure to elicit significant protection may be due to an organism that is too attenuated to stimulate an immune response. A live attenuated vaccine must be carefully balanced to ensure that the organism is attenuated enough so that it does not cause illness, but not too attenuated to induce an immune response [26] .\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, the authors have not been able to identify any other immunoinformatics database that is similar to our VirmugenDB. The VirmugenDB database can be used for many applications. For example, the virmugens can be used for rational vaccine design based on successful virmugen vaccines in other pathogens. Different virmugens stimulate different immune responses, which addresses the need for specific immune responses to confer protection against disease. Many diseases are complex in their interaction with the immune system, thus making vaccine design difficult. Usage of different types of virmugens induces different immune responses, which can be tailored for use in vaccines against specific pathogens and diseases that require different responses.\n\nVirmugenDB is the first database that collects virmugens, i.e., the virulent factors whose mutation leads to the generation of successful live attenuated vaccines. The analysis of VirmugenDB data allows us to identify specific patterns of virmugens and host responses induced by virmugen mutants. VirmugenDB is targeted to become a central and vital source of virmugens and will support researchers in the areas of vaccinology, microbiology, and immunology with curated data and bioinformatics tools. In the time of extensive vaccine research, VirmugenDB is a timely repository and will have significant impact for rational vaccine development and better understanding of fundamental protective immune mechanisms.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.\n\nVaccine.

VirmugenDB annotation workflow and system design A semi-automatic process was performed to annotate virmugen data. Manual curation includes peer-reviewed publications from PubMed. A PubMed ID (PMID) is extracted and used to retrieve detailed citation information (e.g., authors, journal, and date). The evidence that proves the status of virmugen for each protein is curated from published experimental studies. Vaccines associated with the virmugens are also curated. PDB IDs are manually retrieved when available to provide 3D structure information of individual protective antigens. Internally developed script uses an input sequence ID from a NCBI database (e.g., NCBI Entrez Gene database) to automatically retrieve different types of information. The extracted DNA and protein sequences are further used for bioinformatics analyses using different methods. A web-based VirmugenDB query system is available for public query and analysis of Virmugen data. Compared to the wild type virulent parent strain, a live attenuated virmugen mutant has a mutated virmugen that encodes for a virulence factor. The virmugen virulence factors often involve synthesis and metabolism of various nutrients including amino acids, carbohydrates, and nucleotides. Some virmugens are critical for cell membrane formation. When a virmugen mutant or a virulent parent strain infects a host, similar and different host immune responses will occur. Specifically, a virulent pathogen will initiate a series of pathological host processes that lead to a host disease. The host immune system is often hijacked by the pathogen, allowing the pathogen to survive and replicate inside the host. In contrast, the host immune system will form a strong defense process(es) to eventually eliminate the live attenuated virmugen mutant inside the host. In terms of the induction of protective immunity, common protective immune responses may be generated by the host for both virmugen mutant and its parent virulent strain. In this case, the levels of immune responses between these two strains may be different. In addition, the host immune system may be able to generate a protective immunity that is unique to the live attenuated virmugen mutant (not for virulent parent strain). All the differences can be traced to the original mutation of a virmugen(s). "}
