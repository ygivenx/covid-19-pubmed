{"title": "Coronavirus S protein-induced fusion is blocked prior to hemifusion by Abl kinase inhibitors", "body": "Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses and include those that cause the common cold as well as the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In order to gain entry into host cells, all enveloped viruses, including coronaviruses, fuse with cellular membranes.\n\nCoronaviruses bind to cell surface receptors and fuse with the plasma membrane or are endocytosed and fuse with endosomes. This fusion step is required in order for the viral genome to be delivered to the host cell cytoplasm for replication. SARS and MERS coronaviruses fuse with late and early endosomes, respectively, and also at the plasma membrane (1) (2) (3) (4) . The virus S protein mediates fusion between viral and host cell membranes.\n\nSince the outbreaks of SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012, these viruses have been studied extensively in order to understand infection and pathogenicity with the goal of identifying therapeutic targets. A high-throughput screen identified an Abelson (Abl) kinase inhibitor, imatinib, as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (5) . Abl kinases are nonreceptor tyrosine kinases localized to the cytoplasm. Two Abl kinases, Abl1 and Abl2, are expressed in human cells, and are involved in several cellular processes ranging from embryonic morphogenesis to mediating viral infections (6, 7) . Imatinib is a small molecule inhibitor specifically designed to target the Abl kinase portion of the BCR-Abl protein (8) , which results from a chromosomal translocation and causes chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (9) (10) (11) .\n\nPreviously, we have shown that imatinib blocks entry of pseudotyped virions containing SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV S protein (12) . Inhibition of SARS and MERS coronavirus entry by imatinib implicates Abl kinase activity in coronavirus infection, and reports from other groups demonstrate Abl kinase involvement in infections by several other viruses (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . This strongly suggests the Abl kinase signaling pathway is promising to investigate for development of antiviral therapies.\n\nBased on results from our previous report, we hypothesize that Abl kinase activity is required for entry of other coronaviruses, presumably for virus-cell fusion. The classification of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as BSL-3 pathogens and SARS-CoV as a select agent, presents a barrier to the experimental methods that can be performed with the live viruses. Additionally, membrane composition of pseudotyped virions differs from that of true virions since pseudotyped virions bud from the plasma membrane while true virions bud from the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (21, 22) . This could lead to differences in virus-cell fusion and entry mechanisms. Because of this, it is important to evaluate these effects in a live virus system and it is advantageous to find a BSL-2 coronavirus that can be used as a model of infection. Here, we report the effects of imatinib and two other Abl kinase inhibitors, GNF2 and GNF5, on IBV infection. We show that the Abl kinase inhibitors interfere with the first round of IBV infection, indicating an inhibition of virus-cell fusion. In addition, we directly demonstrate that cell-cell fusion and syncytia formation mediated by IBV S is inhibited by imatinib, GNF2 and GNF5 prior to hemifusion, suggesting a role for Abl kinases in both virus-cell and cell-cell fusion events. IBV will be an excellent model to determine the mechanism of Abl kinase action during coronavirus entry in order to find new targets for therapeutic intervention. Plasmids. pCAGGS/SARS-CoV S and pCAGGS/VSV G were previously described (24, 25) . the RRFRR furin cleavage site between S1 and S2) were PCR amplified from a cDNA vector containing codon-optimized sequence of IBV S1, and nucleotides 1614-2955 flanked by HindIII and XmaI sites were PCR amplified from cDNA containing the codon-optimized sequence of IBV S2 (27, 28) . QuikChange mutagenesis (Agilent Genomics) was used to remove the HindIII restriction site between S1 and S2 once the amplicons had been ligated together, and the full coding sequence was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing.\n\nAntibodies and Abl kinase inhibitors. The mouse monoclonal anti-IBV S antibody (9B1B6) recognizes the lumenal domain and was a kind gift from Ellen Collisson (Western University of Health Sciences) (29) . The rabbit polyclonal anti-IBV S antibody to the Cterminus was previously described (26) , as was the rabbit polyclonal antibody to SARS S (anti-SCT) (24) .

We used two different types of inhibitors in order to determine target specificity as well mechanism of inhibition. Imatinib is a competitive inhibitor that binds near the ATP-binding pocket preventing binding of ATP (31, 32) . Imatinib only binds when the Abl kinase is in the closed, inactive conformation (32) . GNF2 and GNF5\n\nbind to the auto-inhibitory myristate-binding site of the Abl kinase, leading to inactivation of the active kinase by promoting the closed conformation (33) . Imatinib has several cellular targets, while GNF2 and GNF5 specifically inhibit the Abl kinases (33, 34) . Treating infected cells with these specific inhibitors allowed us to evaluate the likelihood of Abl kinase involvement in coronavirus infection as opposed to any of the other cellular targets of imatinib. Vero cells were infected with IBV at MOI 0.1 in the absence and presence of the three inhibitors. Supernatants were harvested 18 h post-infection, and a plaque assay was used to measure viral titers of all samples. Results from this experiment showed that all three drugs significantly decreased virus titer. Imatinib lowered the viral titer ~90% when compared to control, and GNF2 and GNF5 lowered titer ~95% ( Figure 1A ).\n\nNext, we determined whether the decrease in titer was due to reduced virus production in infected cells or the result of fewer cells being infected. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using an antibody to the IBV S protein was used to count the number of infected cells in the absence and presence of the Abl kinase inhibitors. Our observations showed that imatinib and GNF5 reduced the number of cells infected by ~90%, and GNF2 decreased the number of infected cells ~80% when compared to control ( Figure 1B) . These results demonstrate that the decrease in IBV titer was due to a decrease in the number of cells infected.\n\nThe inhibition by GNF2 and GNF5 suggests Abl1 and/or Abl2 specifically play a role in IBV infection.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/246991 doi: bioRxiv preprint Previously, we showed imatinib prevents entry of pseudotyped viruses expressing SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV S protein (12) . In order to determine if IBV is blocked at the entry step by Abl kinase inhibitors, we infected Vero cells at a high MOI and for a duration that would only allow one round of infection. Supernatants were harvested at 8 h post-infection, and IBV titers were measured using a plaque assay. Results from this experiment showed a significant decrease in virus titer when IBV-infected cells were treated with imatinib, GNF2 or GNF5 as compared to control. Titer was reduced ~80% by imatinib and GNF2, and 70% by GNF5 (Figure 2A) . We also observed a decrease in the total number of cells infected by 70% after treatment with all three drugs ( Figure 2B ).\n\nWe considered that the decrease in number of cells infected could be due to decreased virus binding to host cell receptors. To address this, we infected Vero cells at a high MOI for 8 h and removed imatinib at indicated time points post-infection ( Figure 3A ). All cells were pretreated with DMSO or imatinib, and either DMSO or imatinib was present in the infection medium during adsorption. Pre-treatment occurred from t-1 through t0, and adsorption occurred from t0 through t1. Imatinib is a reversible inhibitor of Abl kinases (35) and we observed a rapid reversal of its effects on IBV infection after its removal from the cell culture medium. Results from this experiment showed that when imatinib was removed from the cell culture medium The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/246991 doi: bioRxiv preprint ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (22, 36) , but the S protein is also transported to the cell surface late in infection. Just as S protein on the surface of the virion mediates virus-cell fusion, the S on the surface of infected cells mediates cell-cell fusion resulting in syncytia formation.\n\nBecause the viral S protein mediates both of these events, it seems likely that virus-cell and cellcell fusion may use the same cellular mechanism. Due to the difficulty in capturing individual virus-cell fusion events, we analyzed cell-cell fusion by measuring syncytium size in the absence and presence of imatinib, GNF2 or GNF5. In Vero cells that were infected with IBV, we observed syncytia formation with an average of 22 nuclei per syncytium ( Figure 4A, B) .\n\nTreatment with imatinib, GNF2 or GNF5 resulted in a statistically significant reduction of nuclei per syncytium. Average syncytium size was reduced to 5, 6 and 4 nuclei for imatinib, GNF2 and GNF5, respectively, an ~95% reduction in the presence of each drug ( Figure 4A , B).\n\nNext, we determined whether imatinib, GNF2 and GNF5 inhibited syncytia formation induced by the S protein alone when exogenously expressed. Similar to infection, we observed formation of syncytia containing an average of 16 nuclei when Vero cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding IBV S ( Figure 5A, B) . Treating IBV S-transfected cells with Abl kinase inhibitors significantly reduced the number of nuclei per syncytium to ~4 nuclei for imatinib, GNF2 and GNF5, an ~80% reduction ( Figure 5A, B) . Because SARS-CoV is also inhibited by imatinib (12), we wanted to determine whether Abl kinase inhibitors interfere with fusion induced by SARS-CoV S. To this end, we also tested the effects of all three drugs on syncytia formation produced by the SARS-CoV S protein. Vero cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding SARS-CoV S. The number of nuclei per syncytium was reduced 40% by imatinib, 50% by GNF2 or and 60% by GNF5, as compared to the number of nuclei per syncytium in untreated cells ( Figure 5C, D) . Average syncytium size induced by SARS-CoV S was much smaller than that induced by IBV S (7 nuclei and 16 nuclei per syncytium, respectively), but treatment with all three drugs did reduce the average to three nuclei per syncytium for both IBV S and SARS-CoV S. Note that treatment with Abl kinase inhibitors not only reduced the number of nuclei per syncytium, but also total number of syncytia. We did not quantify this observation, but while more than 50 syncytia containing greater than or equal to three nuclei were found in control cells, we routinely found fewer than 10 syncytia in drugtreated samples. Additionally, there are only two data points for the SARS-CoV S, imatinibtreated cells due to the fact that no syncytia were found in one of the replicate experiments.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/246991 doi: bioRxiv preprint Treatment with imatinib, GNF2 or GNF5 had no effect on the total number of cells expressing VSV-G after transfection of a control plasmid (pCAGGS/VSV-G), demonstrating that the effects of these inhibitors were not due to transfection efficiency (data not shown). Together, these results demonstrate that imatinib, GNF2 and GNF5 interfere with syncytia formation mediated by the S protein both during IBV infection and when S protein is exogenously expressed in the absence of infection. The fact that we see the same phenotype with SARS-CoV S and IBV S reinforces the idea that IBV can be used as a model coronavirus to study Abl kinase involvement in coronavirus infection.\n\nMixing of the outer membrane leaflets (hemifusion) is followed by inner leaflet mixing and Figure 6A ). IBV S staining is not shown, but was used to ensure coexpression of IBV S and YFP-GPI in HeLa cells. We observed 54 total fusion events in the control sample and 25, 20 and 24 total fusion events in samples treated wtih imatinib, GNF2 and GNF5 samples, respectively. Hemifusion events accounted for 14% of all fusion events from control cells, and 8%, 11% and 12%, in cells treated with imatinib, GNF2 or GNF5, respectively ( Figure 6B ).\n\nAlthough total fusion events in drug-treated cells were reduced as expected, treatment with imatinib, GNF2 or GNF5 showed no significant change in the percent of hemifusion events as .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/246991 doi: bioRxiv preprint compared to control cells ( Figure 6B ), suggesting that Abl kinase inhibitors block the initial hemifusion step. This result demonstrates that Abl kinase inhibitors interfere with the cell-cell fusion necessary for syncytia formation, and provides evidence that these drugs may inhibit virus-cell fusion by preventing hemifusion, the first step in membrane mixing.\n\nWe considered that treatment with Abl kinase inhibitors could affect IBV S processing and that this could be the cause of the block in cell-cell fusion. The full length S protein (S0) undergoes two cleavage events necessary for cell-cell fusion to take place. The first occurs at the S1/S2 site and produces two fragments, S1 and S2 (2) . The second cleavage occurs at the S2' site, resulting in exposure of the fusion peptide (3, 4) . In the strain of Vero cells used here, IBV S is cleaved during virion exocytosis, providing a fusion-competent virus prior to host cell receptor binding. Because exposure of the fusion peptide has been shown to be necessary for cell-cell fusion and syncytia formation, we measured the amounts of each cleavage product after treatment with imatinib, GNF2 or GNF5. None of the drug treatments decreased the relative amounts of S0, S2 or S2' (Figure 7A, 7B) , indicating that IBV S protein processing and cleavage are not affected by Abl kinase inhibitors.\n\n.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/246991 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nWe have demonstrated here that the Abl kinase inhibitors, imatinib, GNF2 and GNF5 reduce the viral titer of IBV by decreasing the number of cells infected, and that the first round of virus infection is inhibited. Our data show that each of the three inhibitors prevents syncytia formation induced by IBV as indicated by fewer nuclei per syncytium as compared to infected, untreated cells. A decrease in nuclei per syncytium in IBV S-and SARS-CoV S-expressing cells treated with imatinib, GNF2 or GNF5 demonstrates Abl kinase inhibitors prevent syncytia formation induced by the S protein in the absence of other viral proteins. Our results demonstrate that fusion was inhibited before the hemifusion step, prior to any lipid mixing of membranes. Additionally, we show that cleavage of S into S2 and S2' was not affected by imatinib, GNF2 or GNF5, suggesting that IBV S processing and cleavage is independent of Abl kinase activity. The inhibition by specific inhibitors of Abl kinases, GNF2 and GNF5, strongly suggests that IBV infection requires the activity of Abl1 and/or Abl2. Our previous report showed that Abl2, but not Abl1, is required for entry of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (37) . They are involved in T cell signaling (38, 39) , embryonic development and (6, 40) , and cell migration and invasion in cancer (41, 42) . The distinct domains provide Abl kinases with the ability to act as scaffolds to facilitate building of signaling complexes (6, 43, 44) , and to regulate protein function through phosphorylation of downstream protein targets (43) . Binding actin through the FABD directly regulates cytoskeleton dynamics (44) (45) (46) (47) to activate the essential cellular pathways described above. We hypothesize that coronavirus infection requires the multi-functional actions of Abl kinases for .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/246991 doi: bioRxiv preprint virus fusion at the plasma membrane or endosome membrane in order to gain entry into host cells.\n\nIt is likely that virus-cell and cell-cell fusion induced by the coronavirus S protein use the same or a very similar mechanism. Because Abl kinase activity plays a role in cytoskeletal rearrangement (47, 48) , we hypothesize that Abl kinase inhibitors act by interfering with actin dynamics required for virus-cell and cell-cell fusion. Our hypothesis is supported on two fronts.\n\nFirst, cytoskeletal dynamics have been implicated in infection by several viruses (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . Actin cytoskeleton rearrangement was shown to be required for infection by Coxsackievirus (13), Vaccinia virus (14), HIV (15, 16) , and Variola and monkeypox (17) . These studies demonstrate that cytoskeletal rearrangement is a common mechanism required by many cellular processes that can be hijacked by viruses during infection, as reviewed by others (7, (49) (50) (51) . Second, Abl kinase's role in actin cytoskeletal rearrangement is required for essential cell-cell fusion events, including but not limited to, osteoclast (52) and myoblast fusion (53, 54) during development.\n\nActin-induced podosome like structures are required for fusion of osteoclasts and myoblasts, presumably to alter membrane tension (55, 56) . Interestingly, Harmon et al. (15) reported that cell-cell fusion mediated by the HIV envelope protein was inhibited by imatinib at a posthemifusion step. We did not observe an increase in hemifusion events after treatment of IBVinfected cells with imatinib, GNF2 or GNF5. Since we used a different virus, cell line and fusion assay, it is difficult to compare the two results. We favor the idea that virus interaction with host cell receptors induces actin rearrangements through Abl kinase activity, and that this brings cell membranes in close proximity to allow hemifusion followed by full fusion (55) .\n\nOur results demonstrate that the coronavirus-membrane fusion step is blocked by Abl kinase inhibitors, as suggested by our previous report (12) . Our results also indicate that Abl kinase activity may be involved in the membrane fusion events required for infection by all coronaviruses, and that imatinib, GNF2 and GNF5 have the potential to be general coronavirus inhibitors. This work strongly suggests that proteins involved in the Abl kinase pathway are excellent targets for developing treatments for coronavirus infections. Current studies are underway to determine the Abl kinase functions involved in coronavirus infection as well as determining whether the activity of Abl1 or Abl2, or both kinases is required for coronavirus .
