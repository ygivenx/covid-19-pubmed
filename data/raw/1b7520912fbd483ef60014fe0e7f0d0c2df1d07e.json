{"title": "Supplement Material and Methods 1 2", "body": "Two independent slide readers conducted malaria microscopy on Giemsa stained 5 thick and thin smears. In case of discrepancies a third decisive reading by an 6 additional reader was performed (see supplement material and methods for more 7 details). From CSF, a direct cell count was done using a Fuchs-Rosenthal counting 8 chamber. Urine was tested for the presence of leucocytes and nitrite using dipsticks 9\n\n(Urine Control Stripes, Diagnostik Nord, Germany). Alanine transaminase (ALT) and 10 aspartate transaminase (AST) concentrations were measured in all serum samples on a 11\n\nBiolyzer 100 instrument (Analyticon, Biotechnologies, Lichtenfels, Germany). 12\n\nPatients with ALT or AST concentrations above 150 U/L were screened for hepatitis 13 instructions. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed based on the principle 57 established by Weisburg et al., 1991 [3] . Two different primer pairs were used to 58 amplify the rRNA gene (see Enriched viral particles were then extracted, fragmented, reverse-transcribed, ends 77 repaired, dA-tailed, adaptor ligated and purified. Library preparation was performed 78 using the Nextera XT library prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Next 79 generation sequencing was performed on the MiSeq Illumina platform (2 x 300 bp 80 paired-end sequencing). Resulting raw reads were trimmed, de-duplicated and de 81 novo assembled using a customized NGS pipeline. The assembled contigs and 82 unassembled singlets were compared with a viral proteome database using BLASTx 83 using E-value cutoff 0.01. 84"}
