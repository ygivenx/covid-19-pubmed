{"title": "Molecular Cloning of the Gene Encoding the Putative Polymerase of Mouse Hepatitis Coronavirus, Strain A59", "body": "The genome of the murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus, strain A59 (MHV-A59) is a single-stranded polyadenylated RNA of positive polarity and is at least 30 kb in length (see below) (Lai and Stohlman, 1978) . During infection six capped, polyadenylated subgenomic messenger RNAs are synthesized in addition to full-length positive-sense RNA. The subgenomic RNAs form a nested set, all overlapping with the 3'end of genome RNA and all containing the same 5' 66-nucleotide \"leader\" sequence (Lai et a/., 1981 (Lai et a/., , 1984 Leibowitz et al., 1981; Spaan et al., 1982 Spaan et al., , 1983 Weiss and Leibowitz, 1983, see Fig. 1A) . A full-length negativestranded RNA serves as a template for the synthesis of all virus-specific mRNAs (Lai eta/., 1983) . The common 5'leader sequence is transcribed from the 3'end of this template and is subsequently used as a primer for mRNA synthesis or alternatively spliced co-transcriptionally to the body of the mRNAs (Baric et al., 1987a; Lai et al., 1983 Lai et al., , 1984 Spaan et al., 1988) .\n\nThe coronavirus polymerase needs to possess many activities to initiate and synthesize negative-strand RNA, positive-strand genome length RNA and mRNAs (both genomic and subgenomic), leader RNA, and poly(A). In addition it is likely to possess capping activities as well as the ability to switch templates during ' To whom requests for reprints should be addressed. transcription to promote recombination . Polymerase activity is membrane associated and has been detected in extracts of infected cells (Brayton et al., 1982 (Brayton et al., , 1984 , but has not yet been purified. Gene A, the putative polymerase gene is extremely large and like the avian coronavirus IBV polymerase gene has the capacity to encode 700,000 kDa in proteins . To understand both leader transcription and the structure of the polymerase, we have cloned the MHV-A59 gene A. We describe here the complementary DNA (cDNA) clones and the analysis of the 5'terminal end of the genome.\n\nMHV-A59 (Manaker et al., 1961) was grown in monolayer cultures of murine fibroblast 17CI-1 cells. For preparation of virus-specific RNA, cells were infected at an m.o.i. of 1 and harvested approximately 16 hr later.\n\nPreparation and analysis of RNA Viral genome RNA was prepared from purified virions as described previously (Budzilowicz er a/., 1985) . Intracellular RNA was extracted from the cytoplasm of MHV-A59-infected or mock-infected cells as previously described (Budzilowicz et a/., 1985) . Electro-phoresis of RNA in the presence of formaldehyde was carried out according to the method of Lehrach et al. (1977) . After electrophoresis, RNA was transferred to nitrocellulose and hybridized with radiolabeled probes according to the method of Thomas (1980) .\n\nDNA cloning\n\nFirst-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out as described previously using genome RNA that had been denatured with methyl mercury hydroxide and either random oligomers of calf thymus DNA or restriction fragments as primers (Budzilowicz et a/., 1985) . In most cases second-strand cDNA was synthesized using Escherichia co/i DNA polymerase I in the presence of RNase H according to the method of Gubler and Hoffman (1983) . Oligo(dC) tails were added to the 3'ends of double-stranded cDNA molecules. These tailed DNAs were annealed to oligo(dG)-tailed Pstl-digested pBR322 and used to transform E. co/i, strain DH5. In a second library, derived from an independent A59 stock, oligo(dG)-tailed cDNAs were inserted into pUC9 and transformed into E. co/i, strain JM 109. The cDNA clones containing the genomic leader sequence were identified using a leader-specific probe containing four tandem copies of the 72 nucleotides at the 5' end of A59 genome (pGEM 1 .L3/4).\n\nPreparation and analysis of DNA DNA was electrophoresed on agarose gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose for Southern blot analysis (Southern, 1975) . DNA was labeled with 32P by nicktranslation to a specific activity of > 1 O8 cpm/pg (Rigby et al., 1977) .\n\nDNA sequencing DNA restriction fragments as described under Results were ligated into the polylinker region of M13mp19 RF which was used to transform E. co/i JM103 (Messing et al., 1981) . Single-stranded DNA from M 13 subclones was sequenced according to a modification of the method of Sangeretal. (1977) using [35S]dATP (Biggins et a/., 1983) and T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase, U.S. Biochemicals) in place of the Klenow fragment of polymerase I. Sequencing primers were the universal primers (Promega) or synthetic oligonucleotide primers. The synthetic oligonucleotide primers which were 20 bases long were synthesized at the Wistar Institute or the Chemistry Department at the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA). Sequencing reactions were resolved on gradient polyacrylamide gels (Biggins et a/., 1983) . All sequence analysis was carried out using the programs of PC Gene on an Ep-son Equity Ill+ computer or the lntelligenetics programs through Bionet.\n\nComplementary DNA cloning was carried out using random oligomers of calf thymus DNA as primers for transcription of cDNA from polyadenylated genome RNA. In order to maximize the size of the cDNAs, cloning was carried out according to the method of Gubler and Hoffman (1983) in which there is no Sl nuclease treatment. The average size of the clones obtained was approximately 1.5 kb with the largest being 4.1 kb.\n\nThe recombinant plasmid DNAs from 40 of the largest clones were radiolabeled by nick-translation and used as probes on Northern blots of RNA from both MHV-A59-infected and mock-infected cells. The nested set nature of the RNAs allows the mapping of clones to the unique regions of the RNAs and thus to individual viral genes. DNA from clones mapping to gene G hybridize to all seven viral mRNAs since gene G sequences are present in all seven mRNAs. Conversely, gene A-specific sequences hybridize only to mRNA 1 since this is the only viral mRNA that contains gene A sequences (Fig. 1) . It was important to include uninfected cell RNA on these blots because earlier we obtained clones that appeared to hybridize to MHV-A59 RNA 1 but also hybridized to a band of similar mobility in uninfected cells. Twenty-seven of the 40 cDNA clones analyzed this way mapped to gene A.\n\nClone 1033 was used to orient the gene A clones. Although results from Northern blot analysis indicated that cDNA 1033 mapped to gene B (data not shown, but hybridization was to mRNAs 1 and 2 as in Fig. 1 B, lane D), the size of the insert (3600 bp) suggested that 1033 must also contain sequences from the 3' end of gene A since gene B is approximately 2.1 kb (Luytjes et al., 1988) . In an attempt to more precisely localize cDNA 1033 within genes A and B, the two fragments derived by digestion with Pstl were radiolabeled and used as probes on Northern blots of infected cell RNAs ( Fig. 1 B) . The 1.3-kb fragment hybridized to mRNA 1 only while the 2.3 kb fragment hybridized to both mRNAs 1 and 2, and must therefore extend into gene B. We have confirmed the presence of the gene A/B intergenic region by sequencing a portion of the 2.3-kb fragment (see below).\n\nTo determine overlaps among the gene A clones, the viral inserts were digested with restriction enzymes and analyzed by cross-hybridization on Southern blots (Southern, 1975) . The gene A-specific clones fell into clusters separated by gaps. The remaining uncharac- terized clones in the cDNA library were screened by end of genome; none of the clones hybridized to a hybridization to probes made from cDNAs which probe made from the leader sequence-specific clone mapped to regions bordering a gap. This extended the pGEM 1 .L3/4. From a cloning using a 1200-nucleotide lengths of the clusters resulting in three groups of EcoRIIHindlll 917 restriction fragment as primer, we clones.Thesewere1033to920,1220to917,and 136 selected clone D34 which was contiguous with clone to 1410 (Fig. 2) 2. Map of gene A-specific DNA clones. cDNAs were mapped by restriction analysis and Northern and Southern blots as described in the text. Only the enzymes Pstl, EcoRI, HindIll, and BarnHI were used across the entire genome. Nucleotide -9589 marks the beginning of the intergenic sequence between genes A and B and is 9589 nucleotides from the poly(A) tail of genome RNA. domly primed library made from an independent stock of MHV-A59, closed the gap between 1220 and 920. From a cloning using a 750-nucleotide AvaIIHindIII fragment of 1410, we obtained many leader-positive clones, among which were clones 077 and ZAl 1. Clone ZAl 1 shared homology with 1410 and thus completed the cloning of the 5' end. Clones 005 and 507Bl2, both located near the 5'end of genome, were obtained from the second randomly primed library. Of all the 5' proximal clones only ZAl 1 contained the entire leader sequence. The contiguous series of cDNAs revealed that gene A was considerably larger than the 7 kb previously estimated (Lai and Stohlman, 1978; Leibowitz et al., 1981; Spaan et a/., 1982) . The restriction digests and Southern blots indicated that the A59 gene A is approximately 23 kb, similar to the avian coronavirus (IBV) gene A (Fig. 2) .\n\nThe 5' end of the genome The sequence of the 5' 2000 nucleotides of the MHV-A59 genome RNA was obtained by sequencing of clones 077, ZAl 1, 005, and 507Bl2 (Fig. 2) . The viral fragments were digested with the restriction enzymes listed in the legend to Fig. 3 and the fragments subcloned into the RF of Ml 3mpl9. Sequencing was carried out using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination technique with a universal sequencing primer and synthetic oligonucleotide primers (Fig. 3) . This 5'leader sequence, obtained from ZAl 1, is the same as that obtained from A59 mRNA (Lai et al., 1984) . A typical intergenie sequence, AAUCUAAAC, is observed at nucleotides 61-71 (Table 1) . Downstream of the intergenic region, the 5' A59 sequence contains a short open reading frame starting at nucleotide 99 and a longer one starting at nucleotide 2 10 continuing past nucleotide 2000 (Fig. 4) . The sequence was translated into amino acids. The protein predicted from the sequence of the open reading frame beginning at nucleotide 2 10 is basic and almost identical to the predicted JHM protein which has been shown to be related to ~28, the putative polymerase-related polypeptide . The few amino acid differences between the strains, most of which are conservative, are shown below the A59 sequence. The JHM sequence contains an extra AAUCU repeat at the end of the leader RNA compared to A59 (see Fig. 5 ).\n\nThe secondary structure of the first 150 nucleotides of the A59 genome was predicted using the method of Zucker and Steigler (1981) and as shown in Fig. 5A contains two stems and loops. The structure of the 5' terminus is of interest because the leader RNA presumably is transcribed from this region. A similar sequence is observed for this region in the JHM genome (Fig. 5B) . In this structure, nucleotides 52-69 of A59, containing the end of the leader and the leader/gene A intergenic regions, are found in the region between the loops and therefore may be a likely site for termination of leader synthesis as A/U-rich regions following areas of secondary structure have been associated with termination sites in several systems (Henikoff eta/., 1983; Mills et a/., 1980; Zaret and Sherman, 1982) .\n\nBecause IBV contains terminal repeats proposed as possible polymerase recognition sites, computer analysis using the lntelligenetics programs for sequence or structural homologies were carried out comparing the 3' end of negative strand (complement of the 5' end of plus strand) with the published sequence of the 3' end of the MHV-A59 genome . There were no significant homologies observed between the 350 nucleotides at the 3' ends of MHV-A59 positive and negative strands.\n\nThe 3' end of the MHVA59 gene A was sequenced using clone 1033. A 750-nucleotide SphllSacl piece of the 2.3-kb Pst fragment of 1033 was subcloned into pGEM4 (Promega) and sequenced from each end using the universal sequence primers and using a synthetic oligonucleotide primer derived from the sequence 50 nucleotides upstream of the intergenic region found between genes A and B. This intergenic sequence, AAUCUAUAA, is followed by the first open reading frame of gene B (Luytjes et al., 1988) . This completes the list of intergenic regions for MHV-A59 Budzilowicz et al. (1985) . ' The underlined sequence at the end of the leader is that region homologous with the intergenic regions.\n\n(see Table 1 ). All intergenic regions contain the sequence AAUCUAAAC with the exception of the 1 nucleotide changes in two of the intergenic regions (A/B and E/F) indicated by the underlined nucleotides in Table 1.\n\nWe have created a restriction map of the unique portion of mRNA 1, the putative polymerase gene. This region is bounded by the leader sequence and intergenie sequence on the 5' end and an intergenic sequence on the 3'end. The data suggest that the entire gene is approximately 23 kb. This would suggest that the genome is in excess of 30 kb. We cannot know the exact size of the genome until the entire sequence is obtained.\n\nGene A is likely to encode the MHV polymerase because coronaviruses contain infectious genome RNA (Lomniczi, 1977; our unpublished results) and initiate infection by the translation of viral polymerase(s) from virion RNA. Furthermore, it is likely that translation of genome proceeds from the 5' end as is the case with other eukaryotic mRNAs. The 5' unique region of the avian coronavirus IBV is composed of two large ORFs (Fl and F2) which potentially encode polypeptides of 441 K and 300K . It is thought that a frameshifting mechanism (Jacks and Varmus, 1985; Brierlyetal., 1987) results in the synthesis of one large polypeptide from the two ORFs. Although the 5' regions of MHV-A59 and IBV do not share significant homology (Fig. 4) protein sequence homology between the protein predicted by the IBV ORF2 and the polypeptide predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the 3' portions of MHV-A59 gene A has been observed (Bredenbeek et a/., manuscript in preparation).\n\nA direct identification of the coronavirus polymerase is lacking and there is little information about the MHV gene A products. Purified MHV virion RNA directs the cell-free synthesis of a 250K polypeptide that is processed in vitro into 220K and 28K polypeptides (Denison and Perlman, 1986) ; the 28K polypeptide is derived from the amino terminus and has been identified in the infected cell (Denison and Perlman, 1987) . A basic protein with the characteristics of the 28K polypeptide is encoded in the 5' end of the MHV-JHM and A59 genome RNAs . We are currently using antisera directed against procaryotic/viral fusion proteins representing various portions of gene A to characterize the viral polypeptides responsible for polymerase activity in infected cells.\n\nThe 5' end sequence of the MHV-A59 genome RNA is almost identical to that of the JHM genome . The major difference is an additional AAUCU (see Fig. 5 ) at the end of the JHM leader in the region thought to hybridize with template. It is not clear whether these differences are meaningful since the leader RNAs from each of these strains readily reasso- Fig. 4 . Thus the p28 putative polymerase related protein is conserved between the two strains.\n\nSince the 3'end of the viral negative strand (the complement of the 5' end of the genome) is likely to be the template for transcription of leader RNA, we analyzed the secondary structure of this region. Secondary structure analysis of the 5' ends of the A59 genome RNA showed two stem and loop structures with AG = -35.2 kcal. This structure is similar to that obtained by a similar analysis of the 5'end sequence of the JHM genome. This structure is maintained even as more nucleotides (up to 350) are added to the analysis which suggests that this is maintained as transcription continues further. It is not clear how leader is transcribed, where its transcription is terminated, and where it is released from its template. It seems likely that nucleotide 67 marks the end of the leader transcript as it is the first nonhomologous nucleotide between leader and template in the gene E/F intergenic region (Table  1 ). This is supported by the observation that this is an AU-rich region and is found in a region not involved in a secondary structure loop (Henikoff eta/., 1983; Mills et a/,, 1980; Zaret and Sherman, 1982) . If nucleotide 66 is the end of the leader transcript, then the AAAC (nucleotides 68-71) may be important not for primer hybridization but perhaps for protein interactions needed for initiation of transcription.\n\nSecondary structure analysis of nucleotides 48-l 50 of MHV-JHM led to the hypothesis that the AU-rich region around nucleotides 75-76 (Fig. 5 ) may be a site where polymerase pauses and marks the end of leader transcription (Baric et al., 1987a,b; . This is supported by the presence of leader-related transcripts greaterthan 66 nucleotides in infected cells (Baric et a/., 1987a; . However, as predicted for MHV-A59 or for JHM, when the nucleotide l-l 50 (includes the complete 5'terminus) are analyzed, nucleotides 75 and 76 are contained within the second stem and are not left free.\n\nThe 3'ends of positive-and negative-strand genomesize RNA presumably encode important regulatory sequences involved in the replication of genome. It was of interest therefore to compare the 3' terminal sequence of plus-and minus-strand RNAs. Conservation of a primary nucleic acid sequence or of a secondary structure at the 3'ends of both plus-and minus-strand RNAs would suggest that the same or a similar replication complex recognizes both RNA species. Indeed, sequence homology between the 3' ends of both plusand minus-strand RNAs has been identified in the related coronavirus, IBV. This sequence is about 60 nucleotides in length and is located approximately 50 nucleotides from the 3' ends of both RNA species . However, this homology was not observed in the case of MHV-A59. This is not surprising since in the cases of some other classes of RNA viruses, for example, flaviviruses (Brinton and Dispoto, 1988) and alphaviruses (Levis et a/., 1986) , the regulatory sequences or secondary strtktures are different on plus and minus strands."}
