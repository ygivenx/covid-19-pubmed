{"title": "A Territory-wide study of COVID-19 cases and clusters with unknown source in Hong Kong community: A clinical, epidemiological and phylogenomic investigation", "body": "Background: Initial cases of coronavirus disease 2019 reported in Hong Kong were mostly imported cases from Mainland China. However, most cases reported in February 2020 were local infections with unknown source, indicating local community transmissions.\n\nThis study aimed to report the clinical, epidemiological and phylogenomic characteristics of the local cases of COVID-19 in our community.\n\nWe extracted the demographic, clinical and epidemiological data from 50 COVID-19 patients, who accounted for 53\u00b78% of the cases in Hong Kong by the end of February 2020. We used both Nanopore and Illumina platforms to perform whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from these patients. Phylogenetic relatedness among these local cases and their placement in the global phylogeny were examined. The evolutionary rate and divergence time of transmission were also determined.\n\nOf these 50 patients, only three (6\u00b70%) had visited Wuhan while 43 (86\u00b70%) did not have recent travel records. The average interval from symptom onset to hospital admission was 8\u00b75 days. The most common signs and symptoms on admission were cough (74\u00b70%) and fever (58\u00b70%). Radiographic abnormality was found in 46 (92\u00b70%) patients.\n\nThree (6\u00b70%) patients required ICU admission. Phylogenetic analysis concurred with epidemiological investigation that 42 (84\u00b70%) cases could be grouped into six transmission clusters. Forty-four (88\u00b70%) cases harboured a common mutation Orf3a G251V. Global Fever was the main symptom of COVID-19 with about one-third of the patients presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). About 16% of the patients were considered to be in severe condition on admission, and the estimated mortality rate was 1\u00b74%. 2 Sustained human-to-human transmission was confirmed upon identification of cases clustering among families as well as transmission from patients to healthcare workers, 3, 4 \n\nChina's urgent public health actions and international concern.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global health emergency in late January 2020. As of February 28, 2020, 78 824 patients have been diagnosed to have COVID-19 in Mainland China with 2 788 deaths. The disease also spread to 50 other countries across the world. 5 The first case in Hong Kong was diagnosed on January 23, 2020.\n\nThe patient was a resident of Mainland China who travelled to Hong Kong from Wuhan via Shenzhen by High-Speed Rail, and was thus considered an imported case. The first local case with unknown source, i.e. patient who had no travel record during the 14-day incubation period, was reported on February 4, 2020. 6 By February 28, 2020, there were 93 COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong with at least 70 (75\u00b73%) cases being local cases and their close contacts. 6, 7 Secondary and tertiary transmissions were observed in some clusters of cases. As most index cases of these clusters have unknown sources, a hidden transmission chain was believed to have established in the community. All rights reserved.

With the combined use of Nanopore sequencing and Illumina sequencing, the viral genomes of all these cases were characterised. Phylogenetic and phylodynamic analyses were performed to determine the transmission linkage and the evolutionary rate of COVID-19 cases in our community.\n\nFor this retrospective, multi-centre study, we intentionally enrolled the positive cases of COVID-19 that were laboratory-confirmed at four public hospital clusters managed under the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong, namely Hong Kong East Cluster, Kowloon East Cluster, Kowloon West Cluster, and New Territories West Cluster, from January 26 to February 28, 2020.\n\nSputum specimens and throat swabs pooled with nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from patients who fulfilled the reporting criteria or enhanced surveillance criteria on admission. 8 A patient was considered to have laboratory-confirmed infection when SARS-CoV-2 was detected by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCRs), which amplified the envelope (E) gene and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. 9 The demographic, clinical, and microbiological data were obtained from patients' medical records. The epidemiological information was retrieved from the Centre for Health Protection 6 The definitions of clinical symptoms and complications are based on the WHO guidance. 10 We adopted the case numbering system of CHP, which was based on the date of case confirmation. \n\nThe respiratory specimens were centrifuged at 16,000g for 2 minutes to deplete host cells.\n\nSupernatant was used for total nucleic acid extraction using either MagNA Pure 96 System (Roche Diagnostics, Germany) or NucliSENS \u00ae easyMAG \u00ae (bioM\u00e9rieux, The Netherlands) according to manufacturers' instructions. DNase treatment was done by TURBO DNA-free Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) to remove the residual host DNA.\n\nDNase-treated RNA was reverse-transcribed to single-strand cDNA using random hexamers and SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, USA) as previously described. 11 The viral cDNA was then amplified using two PCRs containing tiled, multiplexed primers (table S1) described in the ARTIC network. 12 Details of the multiplex PCR are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Briefly, multiplex PCR amplicons of each sample were normalised to 1 ng/\u00b5L prior to end-repairing and native barcode ligation (EXP-NBD104/114, ONT, UK). Barcoded samples were pooled and ligated to AMII sequencing adaptor.\n\nSequencing was performed with Nanopore MinION device using R9.4.1 flow cell for 48 hours.\n\nMultiplex PCR amplicons were subjected to library preparation and dual-indexing using \n\nNanopore sequencing data were analysed using a modified Artic Network nCoV-2019 novel coronavirus bioinformatics protocol (Supplementary Appendix). 13 Illumina sequencing reads were mapped with reference to the respective draft genome of each sample constructed from the Nanopore data. Variants were called using freebayes (v1.0.0) with haploid decoding and minimum base quality set at Q30. Consensus genomes were constructed by GATK (v4.1.4.1) based on the VCF file 14 .

The sequences have been submitted to the GenBank with the accession no. MT232662-\n\nTo identify the amino acid change caused by each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), the consensus genome of each specimen was BLASTed against the reference NC_045512.2 using BlastX. The non-synonymous mutations were then identified using custom Python script.\n\nPhylogenetic tree was constructed based on the consensus genomes from the specimens with PhyML (v3.0) using maximum likelihood algorithm. Best-fitting substitution model for phylogenetic analysis was performed by Akaike information criteria, in which the general time reversible model with fixed proportion of invariable sites (+I) was selected. 16 Bootstrap replicates was set at 1000\u00d7, and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was rooted on the earliest published genome of SARS-CoV-2 (accession no.: NC_045512.2). Transmission cluster was defined by clear epidemiological and onset-time relationship. Meanwhile, an additional 273 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were downloaded from GISAID Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 data hub. 15 Together with the genomes from this study, phylogenetic tree was constructed using fast likelihood-based aLRT SH-like method and rooted on SARS-CoV-2 genome NC_045512.2.\n\nAll rights reserved.

MCMC chains were run for 1 \u00d7 10 9 generations and sampled every 500 steps. Bayesian output, including MCMC convergence, growth rate, tMRCA, and effective sample sizes, was analysed after the results were visualised by Tracer (v1.7.1). 18 All parameters had an effective sample size of >200, which indicated sufficient sampling.\n\nFifty patients with COVID-19 were included in this study with 54\u00b70% being female and with mean age of 55\u00b72 years (table 1) . Three cases were considered as imported cases as the patients had stayed in Wuhan before travelling to Hong Kong in mid-January. Four had travelling record to other regions where COVID-19 active community transmission was not confirmed by that time. These cases were considered as possibly local infection. The other 43 were defined as local infection with no recent travel history. Eighteen (36\u00b70%) had chronic illnesses, of which cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases were the most common conditions (table 1). In total, 74\u00b70% of the patients presented with cough. Only 58\u00b70% of the patients on admission presented with fever, but fever gradually developed in 64\u00b70% patients during hospitalisation. Other symptoms were less common, such as muscle ache (25\u00b70%), sore throat (24\u00b70%), shortness of breath (24\u00b70%), and diarrhoea (14\u00b73%) (table 2). Two (4\u00b70%) patients were asymptomatic throughout the study period. According to radiological examination, 27 (54\u00b70%) showed bilateral pneumonia, 11 (22\u00b70%) unilateral pneumonia, and All rights reserved.

Ten of them had developed symptoms two days after the party. A colleague of one infected member, who was not present at the party, was also subsequently diagnosed to have COVID-19. Cluster 5 initiated from a resident of a public estate, who was diagnosed on January 30. Eleven days later, three members of a household, who lived in the same building as, but 10-storey below from, the index case, were also confirmed to be infected. Two of the household members attended a family gathering of 29 people at a Chinese seafood restaurant during their incubation period. Three of them were diagnosed consecutively around two weeks after the gathering. Additionally, a Filipino domestic helper of one infected member, who was absent in the family gathering, was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The earliest reported case of Cluster 6 was a woman who visited a Buddhist worship hall during the Chinese New Year holidays. In addition, eight individuals who had visited the same Buddhist worship hall during this period were later diagnosed. At All rights reserved.

On average, 62 387 and 18 747 reads were obtained per genome sequencing at a depth of 550\u00d7 and 132\u00d7 for Nanopore and Illumina platforms respectively. The size of the consensus genomes was ~29.9 kbp with a GC content of 38%. The genomes were highly conserved in comparison with the first COVID19 genome with an average sequence identity of 99\u00b798% (range: 99\u00b794%-100\u00b70%) and 0-11 SNPs identified for each strain.

[19] [20] [21] [22] However, a largescale study by Guan et al found that fever was presented in only 43\u00b78% of patients on admission 2 . In the present study, fever was identified in only 58\u00b70% of the patients on admission, but developed in 64.0% after hospitalisation. Afebrile patients might be missed if the surveillance case definition relied solely on fever. Therefore, laboratory surveillance should be extended to in-patients and out-patients with respiratory symptoms. Admission to ICU was relatively uncommon (6\u00b70%) in our cohort when compared with previous studies. [19] [20] [21] Two of the three patients presented with severe complications including ARDS, acute renal damage, and septic shock. Of note, both these patients were found to have bacterial coinfection, which was absent in other cases. In addition to the virulence factors of the pathogens, the host's immune status, old age, and presence of chronic medical illness might be associated with enhanced severity of the disease. Prompt administration of antibiotics to prevent infection and strengthening of immune supportive treatment might reduce complications and mortality.\n\nIn Hong Kong, initial cases recorded in January 2020 were mostly imported cases. Since The index case of Cluster 1 (Case 66) was previously defined as possibly local infection as the patient travelled to Guangdong province, which was not considered to have active community transmission by that time. However, our sequencing result showed that the genome of Case 66 was 100% identical to the Wuhan reference genome, and all cases in Cluster 1 did not harbour Orf3a G251V, which was recognized as a hallmark of the local cases with unknown source in our community. Therefore, instead of possibly local infections, Cluster 1 was more likely imported from Mainland China via the index case 66.\n\nCluster 5 originated from a public estate, in which a family of three members (Cases 42, 48, and 49) was speculated to get infected from a confirmed case (Case 12) who lived in the same building, but 10-storey above, through a faulty sewage pipe setup. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, the viral genomes of these cases and other patients in Cluster 5 shared a similar genetic distance from the reference genome and were assigned to the same branch of the tree. This supports a potential transmission linkage among these cases. 1 and 2) . While there was no apparent epidemiological linkage between these clusters, the high degree of genome similarity suggests that these cases might be originated from a single source. The speculation was further supported by the geographical distribution of residences of these patients that they lived in close proximity to each other, and might share overlapping living circles ( figure   S2 ).\n\nCluster 6 was an SSE occurring in a Buddhist worship hall. Two missense mutations G295V and L3606F in Orf1ab were unique to this cluster. Epidemiological investigation identified a monk (Case 102; pink rectangular box of Cluster 6, figure 1) , who was the abbot of the worship hall and had travelled to Mainland China in early January. SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from his respiratory specimen when he was sent to a quarantine centre in late February after being found associated with a series of confirmed cases connected with the worship hall. He was completely asymptomatic throughout the study period. Phylogenetic analysis showed that this case was closest to the root of the cluster (top portion with strains shown in red, figure 2), suggesting that Case 102 could be the index patient of the cluster. By the time of data cut-off, the cluster has already involved 13 patients and the spread was still ongoing. Here we demonstrated the possibility that \"hidden spreader\" could be a source of community outbreak of COVID-19. It also highlights the importance of rapid quarantine of All rights reserved.

While \u03b4 was normally calculated based on recovery date, 23 we used the admission date for calculation because the transmission link in Hong Kong was practically stopped once the patient was hospitalised. Assuming \u03b4 =45\u00b718/year in our calculation, the reproduction number within\n\nHong Kong up to February 28, 2020 was estimated to be 1\u00b784 (95% BCI: 1\u00b737 to 2\u00b735). The value strongly indicated that the outbreak in Hong Kong is still ongoing, but was smaller than the estimated reproduction number of 2\u00b76 in Wuhan as of February 4, 2020. 24 The smaller value is a combined outcome of reduced growth rate and increased \u03b4 . The former one is attributed to very strong public health awareness among Hong Kong people who had greatly reduced their social activities and always put on surgical masks during this period, 25, 26 whereas the latter is the result of robust laboratory surveillance and fast quarantine time in response to COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, tMRCA for the cases in Hong Kong was determined to be December 24, 2019, which is ~25 days since the first symptom onset case (Case 2-the case with the earliest symptom onset, January 18, 2020; figure 1) of our study cohort.\n\nThere are several limitations in our study. First, despite we have included 53\u00b78% of the cases reported in Hong Kong up to February 28, another 43 cases including two fatal cases were not analysed in this study. Second, as most cases in this study were of unknown sources, the incubation period of these cases might vary widely. Studies have shown that the incubation period can vary from 4\u00b75 to 15\u00b78 days, 24 and can be even longer for patients presenting with mild symptoms. However, as the patient might already be infectious during the incubation All rights reserved.

Finally, gap regions were observed in some consensus genomes. This is mainly because WGS was performed on respiratory specimens instead of viral culture. The variable viral load in specimens could affect the yield of sequencing libraries. Nevertheless, the uncovered area only accounted for approximately 1% of the entire viral genome while the remaining mapped regions had an average coverage of >100X, which should provide sufficient and accurate information for our subsequent phylogenetic and phylodynamic analyses.\n\nIn conclusion, phylogenetic and phylodynamic data were consistent with the epidemiological finding that an active community outbreak is occurring in Hong Kong although the clinical presentations of the confirmed cases were generally mild. Vigilant infection control measures, such as rapid isolation of suspected or confirmed cases and their close contacts, and social distancing should be maintained to contain further transmission of COVID-19 in the community.\n\nAll rights reserved.
