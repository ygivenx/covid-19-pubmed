{"title": "Supplemental Information p53 Acts as a Safeguard of Translational Control by Regulating Fibrillarin and rRNA Methylation in Cancer SUPPLEMENTAL EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES SUPPLEMENTAL REFERENCES", "body": ". Quantification using ImageJ software has been performed for p53 (A, C), FBL protein levels (A, D) and p53 target genes, CDKN1A, which encodes p21 protein, and MDM2 (B, E). Graphs represent means and standard deviation of at least 3 experiments. *p<0.05, **p<0.01 and ***p<0.001 according to Student's t-test. Figure  3B . FBL and \u03b2-Actin protein levels were analyzed by western blot in a panel of wild-type p53 and mutant p53 breast cell lines. FBL and \u03b2-Actin lanes were spliced together from discontinuous lanes of the same blot. . Putative p53 responsive elements and primers used in chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP) assays are shown within the sequence. (B) Ectopic p53 expression. p53 expression was analyzed by western blot in HCT-116-p53 -/cells during luciferase assays. (C) Prior ChIP assays, p53 expression has been analyzed by western blot in non-treated HME cells (NT), in camptothecin-treated HME cells (Campto) and in HME-shp53 cells. Protein quantification is presented in the upper panel. (D) As a positive control of ChIP assays, p53 binding to CDKN1A gene promoter, a well-known p53 target gene, has been analyzed by qPCR using specific primers. Graphs represent means and standard deviation of at least 3 experiments. \n\n(cells over-expressing hTERT protein) and HMLE (over-expressing hTERT and SV40 T/t antigens) were a generous gift from R. Weinberg (Elenbaas et al., 2001) . In the lab, we derived another cell line from HME cells stably expressing a shRNA targeting p53 (HME-shp53). In addition, a second series of human mammary immortalized epithelial cells were developed to verify the data obtained with the original Weinberg's cells: they are indicated as HMEC-hTERT which over-express hTERT protein; and HMEC-hTERT-shp53 which overexpress hTERT and a p53 shRNA (Morel et al., 2012) .\n\nand p53 mutation status -The characterisation of the classical molecular markers was previously determined and was reported in Bourdon et al., 2011. Briefly, primary, previously untreated operable breast cancer from 80 Caucasian women (age range 24-89 years; median age 64 years) with sufficient tumor tissue surplus to diagnostic requirements and complete clinical and pathological data were analyzed (Table S1 ). Tumor tissues were macro-dissected by a specialist breast pathologist and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to storage at -80 \u00baC.\n\nSamples were examined following the Tayside Tissue Bank approval under delegated authority from the Local Research Ethics Committee (www.taysidetissuebank.org).\n\nImmunohistochemical staining was carried out on 4 \u03bcm sections of formalin-fixed paraffinembedded tumors with the mouse monoclonal anti-estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1) antibody 6F11, progesterone receptor (PR) antibody clone 16 and mouse monoclonal anti-ErbB2 antibody CB11 (Her2, Novocastra Laboratories Ltd). Additional analyses were performed according to histological tumor grade (Bloom and Richardson, 1957) and graded by a specialist consultant breast pathologist. Estrogen receptor (ER) status (as ER negative 0-3 vs ER positive 4-18) was determined by the Quickscore method (Detre et al., 1995) . ErbB2 scoring was performed as previously described . p53 mutation status was determined using 100 ng of genomic DNA extracted from homogenized frozen tissues as described previously (Baker et al., 2010) , using the AmpliChip p53 Test (Roche Diagnostics).\n\nTumor samples were examined by RT-qPCR using a LightCycler (Roche) in combination with the LightCycler LC480 SYBR Green I Master (Roche). For FBL gene, the amount of target was calculated as followed by (1) normalizing FBL expression to that of the RNA18S gene and (2) calculating the relative FBL expression to that of the calibrator: E -(\u0394CTsample-\n\n, where E is the efficiency of the RT-qPCR reaction calculated with the slope of the corresponding standard curve, CT is the threshold cycle, and \u0394CT is (CT target gene -CT 18S). Statistical analysis of RT-qPCR measurements was performed using the Mann-Whitney test by Statgraphics\u00ae 3 plus software (Statgraphics Centurion). The results were judged to be statistically significant at a confidence level greater than 95 % (p<0.05). Statistical comparisons between p53 mutation status and FBL expression were made using Wilcoxon test and a p-value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.\n\nVectors and luciferase assays -To investigate whether p53 regulates FBL promoter activity, a pFBL-Luc plasmid has been constructed. Briefly, nucleotide sequence corresponding to partial exon 1 and intron 1 of FBL gene that contains two p53 response elements, has been cloned upstream the minimal SV40 promoter of pGL3-SV40-Fluc vector to drive firefly luciferase reporter gene. For these luciferase assays, transfection efficiency was normalised by co-transfecting pRL construct constitutively expressing the renilla luciferase gene.\n\nLuciferase activity was measured by luminescence using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay (Promega). All data were given as relative luciferase activity (firefly/renilla).\n\nTo The purified DNAs were amplified by qPCR using StepOne Plus (Applied Biosystems) and\n\nFastStart Universal SYBR Green Master (ROX) (Roche). \u00b0C at 750 g and 12,000 rpm, respectively. A part of the cytoplasmic fraction was separated on a 10-40 % sucrose gradient by ultracentrifugation at 250,000 g for 2 hr at 4 \u00b0C. Ribosome distribution all along the gradients was analyzed by measuring the OD 260 nm of 500 \u00b5l fractions using a Nanodrop. RNA quality of each fraction was verified by separating RNA in 1 % agarose gel. RNA was extracted using TriPure Isolation reagent (Roche) from both the cytoplasmic fractions and the polysomal-pooled fractions. RNA levels were quantified by RT-qPCR as described above. mRNA levels of interest were normalized to the ones of GAPDH and ratio of polysomal fraction/cytoplasmic fraction were calculated to take into account any variation of mRNA levels due to transcriptional processes. INHBA mRNA was used as an mRNA control that does not contain IRES.\n\nCell proliferation. Cell proliferation was determined by a real time monitoring assay based on variation of electric impedance (xCELLigence technology, Roche). Briefly, 10 4 cells were seeded in an E-plate 16 plugged-in a RTCA (Real Time Cell Analysis) monitor within the CO 2 incubator. Cell anchorage induces variation in electric impedance that allows monitoring cell proliferation since increase in electric impedance is correlated to proportional increase in cell proliferation (Ke et al., 2011) . After normalisation of electric impedance 24 hr post-seeding, index of cell proliferation reflecting the slope of growth curves was calculated by the RTCA software.\n\nAnchorage-independent cell proliferation was analyzed by soft-agar assay. 5.10 4 cells were suspended in a 0.9 % agarose-2X complemented DMEM medium and added to a solidified 1.5 % agarose-2X complemented DMEM medium. Cells were grown for 3 weeks before 10 % paraformaldehyde fixation and 0.05 % crystal violet coloration. Colony numbers were counted automatically using ImageJ software.\n\nDifferential sensitivity in doxorubicin treatment was analyzed by determining the IC50 in different clones. Briefly, 5.10 3 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate 24 hr prior addition of increasing concentration of doxorubicin (0 to 100 \u00b5M). Metabolic activity of cells was analyzed by MTS assays (Promega) and IC50 of doxorubicin was calculated.\n\nEvaluation of prognosis value of FBL mRNA expression -In this study, the primary outcomes were breast cancer-specific survival and relapse-free survival. Breast cancerspecific survival was measured from the date of diagnosis to death or censored at the last follow up. Accordingly, non-breast cancer deaths were censored at the time of death (i.e., at the time of their death, the women were considered to have survived breast cancer but died of other causes). Relapse-free survival was measured from date of diagnosis to relapse, or censored at last follow-up. We considered relapse as tumor diagnosis at primary tumor site, at secondary site and/or metastasis. In order to explore the prognostic value of FBL using the Kaplan-Meier method, the FBL expression data were first transformed into binomial data (0 for \"low expression level\" or 1 for \"high expression level\"). ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curves were used to determine the optimal cut-off point of FBL gene expression (i.e., to determine at which level of FBL gene expression best segregated patients in terms of survival). According to ROC curve analysis, breast tumor samples with a FBL gene expression below or equal to 0.085 were defined as \"low expression level\" and breast tumor samples with a FBL gene expression superior to 0.085 were defined as \"high expression level\". Survival rates were then estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier method and the log rank test was used to assess the statistical differences between the two groups. In Image quantification -Western blots, northern blots were quantified using ImageJ software.\n\nExpression levels of proteins or snoRNAs of interest were normalized to internal control, such as \u03b2-Actin or total RNA visualized by ethidium bromide staining.\n\nSequence ( "}
