{"title": "Clinical severity of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus", "body": "In the event of emergence of a new influenza virus with capacity to infect and cause disease in humans, such as the recent emergence of influenza A(H7N9) virus, risk assessment is an urgent public health priority. [1] [2] [3] In the recent guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, risk assessment metrics were broken down into ten criteria in three categories. 4 The three categories are (1) properties of the virus including potential for transmissibility; (2) properties of the population including preexisting immunity and the seriousness profile of human infections; and (3) ecology and epidemiology in animals and humans. The second category includes one of the most difficult criteria to assess, but the most important in terms of public health impact, 4 namely the clinical severity of human infections which includes measures such as the case fatality risk. 5 The seriousness of infections has major implications for the potential overall severity of an influenza pandemic. 3 However, it is challenging to assess severity because typically the most serious illnesses associated with infection have a much higher probability of being detected and laboratory-confirmed compared to mild illnesses. 6 Human infections with the novel influenza A(H7N9) virus were first identified in China in February-March 2013, and the initial laboratory-confirmed cases all occurred in patients with serious illness. [7] [8] [9] The earliest laboratory-confirmed cases were clustered around the Yangtze river delta while more recent laboratory-confirmed cases have occurred in neighbouring provinces to the south and north. 10, 11 The majority of laboratory-confirmed cases occurred in urban areas in persons reporting recent exposure to live poultry, 11 investigation of live poultry markets in Huzhou found high prevalence of infection in poultry, 12 and closure of live poultry markets appears to have been effective in controlling outbreaks. [12] [13] [14] Intensive follow-up of more than 2,500 close contacts of laboratoryconfirmed cases identified just four potential secondary A(H7N9) virus infections, 11 consistent with very low human-to-human transmissibility. Pre-existing immunity to A(H7N9) virus is likely to be low in all age groups of the general population. 15 While initial estimates of clinical severity focused on the clinical severity and risk of fatality among the laboratory-confirmed cases, [8] [9] [10] this may give an incomplete picture of the clinical severity of influenza A(H7N9) virus infections. 16 As the outbreak has continued, it has become clear that undetected cases of milder symptomatic infections have occurred. First, assuming that there is no immunity across all ages, the pattern in age-specific incidence of serious cases is not consistent with presumed patterns in exposure, implying that severity increases with age and that many undetected mild infections have occurred in adults. 17 Second, six of the 131 laboratory-confirmed cases as of May 28, 2013 have been identified via national sentinel influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance (including the most recent case, reported on May 28), which is a population-wide system for measuring patterns in consultation rates of patients with ILI and conducting virologic testing for influenza virus infections in a subset of patients. 18, 19 Of the six cases with ages ranging from 2-26y, only one had pneumonia while the other five cases had uncomplicated illness. As this surveillance system is based on a sampling approach, laboratory confirmation of the six cases implies a substantial number of unconfirmed symptomatic infections with mild to moderate severity. Here, our objective is to assess the clinical severity profile of cases of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus based on available information to date, in order to inform assessment of potential pandemic risk. We estimated the clinical severity profile in terms of the risk of fatality, mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) admission among hospitalised cases, and the risk of fatality among symptomatic cases.\n\nIn China, all laboratory-confirmed A(H7N9) cases are reported to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) through a national surveillance system. Case definitions, surveillance for identification of A(H7N9) cases, and laboratory test assays are described in a previous report. 10 A joint field investigation team comprising staff of local or provincial level CDC and/or the China CDC conducted field investigations of the laboratory-confirmed cases of A(H7N9) virus infection. Demographic, epidemiological and basic clinical data on A(H7N9) cases were collected on standardized forms.\n\nAn integrated database was constructed by China CDC, with detailed epidemiologic information on each laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H7N9) case reported to China CDC by May 28 2013 . Information used in the present analysis included the age, sex, place of residence, dates of illness onset, hospital admission, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and death or recovery/discharge.\n\nIt was determined by the National Health and Family Planning Commission that the collection of data from laboratory-confirmed A(H7N9) cases was part of a continuing public health investigation of an emerging outbreak and was exempt from institutional review board assessment.\n\nWe took two approaches to characterizing the severity of A(H7N9) virus infection. First, among laboratory-confirmed cases that required hospitalisation, we examined the risk of serious outcomes including death, admission to ICU, and mechanical ventilation. Then we sought to estimate the number of symptomatic cases of A(H7N9) virus infection to form the denominator for the symptomatic case fatality risk. Together, these measures characterize the clinical severity profile of A(H7N9) and permit comparison with other influenza virus infections.\n\nGarske et al. 6 discussed two complications in characterizing severity, namely the potential for underascertainment of cases, and the problem of incomplete information on outcomes during a continuing outbreak. Our approach attempts to circumvent the problem of underascertainment of cases and in particular shifts over time in case ascertainment, by focusing on hospitalised cases. In order to allow for incomplete information on outcomes, we used survival analysis to permit the inclusion of all hospitalised cases in our analysis incorporating data on cases that remain hospitalised at the time of analysis that would be typical of any evolving, incomplete outbreak.\n\nWe estimated the hospitalisation fatality risk within a competing risks framework. 20 Specifically, each hospitalised patient either dies of the disease or recovers. The admission to death distribution F 1 and the admission to recovery distribution F2 were estimated using a non-parametric approach, accounting for the competing nature of the outcomes and censoring. The hospitalisation fatality risk was estimated by the fraction F 1 /(F 1 + F 2 ) at 6 weeks after admission; 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were constructed using a bootstrap approach with 1000 resamples. 20 We used the same non-parametric approach to estimate two other serious outcomes of hospitalisation, namely ICU admission and mechanical ventilation. Since some patients died without requiring mechanical ventilation, we grouped the two outcomes together to estimate the risk of mechanical ventilation or death, where the alternative outcome is recovery without requiring ventilation. For the same reason we estimated the risk of ICU admission or mechanical ventilation or death, versus recovery without requiring ICU admission and/or mechanical ventilation.\n\nThe hospitalisation dates were unavailable for a small number of hospitalised patients. In addition, a small number of patients were admitted to ICU or required mechanical ventilation but the exact date of ICU admission or ventilation was not available in our dataset. Therefore, we used multiple imputation with 20 replications to allow for unknown dates of hospitalisation, ICU admission or ventilation. 21 We first estimated the distributions of time from illness onset to hospitalisation, and from hospitalisation to ICU admission or ventilation by complete case analysis. Then we used the derived distributions, truncated by the duration of follow up for a specific patient, to impute event dates. We estimated the risks of fatality, ICU admission and mechanical ventilation with 95% CIs from the 20 imputed datasets, and estimated the pooled means across the imputed datasets using Rubin's formula. 22 In addition to the overall analyses described above, we investigated the risk of fatality, ICU admission and ventilation among hospitalised cases <60 years and \u226560 years of age. To investigate the information on severity for hospitalised cases that was available earlier in the A(H7N9) outbreak, we performed retrospective analyses on the overall hospitalisation fatality risk based on data available on different cutoff dates in April and May.\n\nTo put the clinical severity profile into proper context, i.e. by providing a denominator consisting of all infected and symptomatic cases, we estimated the number of symptomatic A(H7N9) virus infections in Shanghai and Nanjing based on the numbers of cases detected by routine virological surveillance at ILI sentinel sites. Specifically, we combined these data with the daily number of all ILI cases reported and specimens tested by ILI surveillance in the two cities to infer the number of A(H7N9) virus infections that would have sought medical care at ILI sentinels (N ILI-S ) (see Appendix for details on the statistical model). We then used two alternative methods to estimate the number of symptomatic infections in Shanghai and Nanjing. In method 1, we assumed that health-care seeking behaviour for cases of ILI associated with A(H7N9) virus infection was the same as health-care seeking behaviour for cases of ILI associated with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection. We therefore divided N ILI-S by the proportion of symptomatic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infections that attended medical care at ILI sentinels during the 2009 pandemic in China (Appendix).\n\nIn method 2, we assumed that all cases of ILI associated with A(H7N9) virus infection sought medical care, and we estimated the number of symptomatic A(H7N9) cases based on the proportions of outpatient consultations at the sentinel locations compared to the total number of consultations in Shanghai and Nanjing (Appendix). Statistical analyses were conducted in R version 3.0.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).\n\nThe funding bodies had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, preparation of the manuscript, or the decision to publish. The joint first authors had complete access to the data; the corresponding authors had final responsibility for the decision to submit the manuscript.\n\nAs of May 28 2013, 131 laboratory-confirmed A(H7N9) cases have been officially recorded in mainland China. Among those confirmed cases, 123 have required hospitalisation for medical reasons, and, among the hospitalised cases, 37 have died while 69 have recovered. For the other 8/131 confirmed cases, three cases were diagnosed after they had already recovered from mild illness, while five cases with mild illness were hospitalised including two of the cases identified through ILI surveillance that was hospitalised for observation plus three other cases admitted for observation by the physician. These five hospitalised mild cases are not included in the following analyses. The characteristics of 123 hospitalised cases are summarized in Table 1 ; 58% are \u226560 years of age, and 71% are male. Hospitalisation dates were unavailable for 3 hospitalised cases. Accounting for incomplete data on 17 patients who are still hospitalised as of May 28, i.e. who have not yet recovered or died, we estimated that the overall hospitalisation fatality risk is 36% (95% CI: 26%, 45%) ( Figure 1, Table 2 ). Among the 37 hospitalised cases that died, the median time to death was 11 days, while among the 65 cases that recovered the median time to recovery was 18 days (Figure 1 ).\n\nAmong 123 hospitalised cases, detailed clinical information was not available on 13 and 15 hospitalised cases including requirements for ICU admission or mechanical ventilation, respectively. Among the other hospitalised cases, 71 required mechanical ventilation, and 83 were admitted to ICU. Using multiple imputation to account for missing data on calendar dates of ICU admission and mechanical ventilation for 1 and 23 patients who were known to have been admitted to ICU or ventilated, respectively, and allowing for censoring in 17 patients who are still hospitalised as of May 28, we estimated that 69% of hospitalised cases required mechanical ventilation or died, while almost all (83%) hospitalised cases required ICU admission/ventilation or died ( Figure 2 , Table 2 ). We estimated substantially higher risks of ICU admission (p=0.08), mechanical ventilation (p=0.0067), and death (p=0.0019) among hospitalised cases \u226560 years of age compared to younger cases ( Figure 2 , Table 2 ). There was some evidence that disease generally progressed or resolved faster in those <60 years of age compared to older cases (Figure 1, Figure 2) but with a small sample size we did not have sufficient statistical power to warrant further investigation. Estimating the hospitalisation fatality risk based on information available up to each date from April 23 through May 28, we found that the estimated risk gradually declined over time with considerable initial uncertainty, while the precision has increased over time because of increasing number of cases as well as longer follow-up of hospitalised cases (Figure 3 ).\n\nWe estimated that 23 (7-58) and 40 (7-129) symptomatic A(H7N9) virus infections sought medical care at ILI sentinels in Shanghai and Nanjing based on identification of 2 and 1 cases through ILI surveillance in each city, respectively. Under method 1 for estimating the number of symptomatic A(H7N9) virus infections, nationwide serosurvey and ILI surveillance of A(H1N1)pdm09 in China during June 2009 to January 2010 indicated that around 0.75% of symptomatic A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infections sought medical care at ILI sentinels. 23 Assuming that a similar proportion of symptomatic A(H7N9) virus infections attended ILI sentinels, we estimated that approximately 3,020 (95% credible interval, CrI: 900-7,800) and 5,310 (95% CrI: 880-17,300) symptomatic A(H7N9) virus infections had occurred in Shanghai and Nanjing, respectively (Appendix). With 40 hospitalised cases occurring in Shanghai and Nanjing, pro-rata extrapolation based on 123 total hospitalisations to date gives a total of 27,000 (95% CrI: 9,530-65,000) symptomatic A(H7N9) virus infections. This corresponds to a symptomatic case fatality risk of 160 (95% CrI: 63-460) per 100,000 symptomatic cases.\n\nUnder method 2 for estimating the number of symptomatic A(H7N9) virus infections, approximately 21% and 11% of outpatient visits in the internal medicine, paediatrics and emergency departments in Shanghai and Nanjing occurred in the sentinel ILI sites in those cities. Allowing for this coverage, we estimated that approximately 107 (95% CrI: 33-273) and 367 (95% CrI: 61-1,200) symptomatic A(H7N9) virus infections had occurred in Shanghai and Nanjing, respectively (Appendix). Pro-rata extrapolation based on 40/123 hospitalisations as in method 1 gives a total of 1,500 (95% CrI: 470-4,050) symptomatic A(H7N9) virus infections. This corresponds to a symptomatic case fatality risk of 2,800 (95% CrI: 1,000-9,400) per 100,000 symptomatic cases.\n\nOur findings represent the most complete picture to date of the clinical severity profile of influenza A(H7N9) virus infections in China. Severity is one of the major components of risk assessment for a potential pandemic, 1-4 and our findings put the early reports of severe laboratory-confirmed A(H7N9) cases 7-9 into perspective. While previous clinical case series have focused on the potential for A(H7N9) virus infection to cause severe illness including hospitalisation, ICU admission and death, 7, 8, 24 we estimated that a substantial number of milder A(H7N9) cases might have occurred. Our results thus support continued vigilance and sustained intensive control efforts against A(H7N9) to minimize the risk of human infection, that is greater than previously recognized, and consequently to minimize the opportunities for this virus to acquire the ability to transmit efficiently between humans.\n\nPerhaps the most notable aspect of our analysis is the absence of the \"confirmed-case fatality risk\" metric. Elsewhere we have recommended that this term be avoided for epidemiological analysis of pandemic influenza viruses, 25 and here we argue that this term should be avoided for A(H7N9). The confirmed cases of A(H7N9) are apparently biased towards infections associated with serious illnesses, 17 and yet a small proportion of confirmed cases were identified through sentinel ILI surveillance. Because of this underascertainment, the confirmed-case fatality risk would apply neither to hospitalised cases (in whom the risk of fatality is higher), nor to mild symptomatic cases of A(H7N9) virus infection. Shifts in case-ascertainment over time, for example by increasing the proportion of ILI specimens tested every week in affected regions, would change the confirmed-case fatality risk, perhaps substantially, without any actual change in the underlying clinical severity profile of A(H7N9) virus infection.\n\nInstead, we propose a two-stage approach that was also recommended in the 2009-10 pandemic of A(H1N1)pdm09 to provide a more stable and robust assessment of severity. 26, 27 First, we estimated that the risk of fatality among hospitalised cases was 36% (95% CI: 26%, 45%). This is higher than the currently observed, and widely reported, fatality risk <25%. 9, 10, 28-30 Our estimate accounted for the unknown outcomes of cases that remain hospitalised (Figure 1 ). This hospitalisation fatality risk for A(H7N9) is lower than the hospitalisation fatality risk for A(H5N1) cases reported in China (65%) 31 and elsewhere, 32, 33 but higher than the hospitalisation fatality risk for A(H1N1)pdm09 in China (21%). 34 Second, we estimated that between 1,500 and 27,000 symptomatic A(H7N9) virus infections may have occurred to date, a much larger number than the number of laboratoryconfirmed cases. The proportion of symptomatic A(H7N9) virus infections that sought medical care was likely to have been higher than assumed here because (i) laboratoryconfirmed A(H7N9) cases seemed to have faster and more severe disease progression than A(H1N1)pdm09 and (ii) residents of the highly developed cities of Shanghai and Nanjing were more likely to seek medical care than the general population of China.\n\nThe hospitalisation fatality risk differed substantially by age with a higher risk of fatality among older cases (Figure 1, Table 2 ). Increasing age is also associated with greater severity of hospitalised cases of seasonal influenza and A(H1N1)pdm09. 35, 36 However, age-specific ILI surveillance data were not available to permit assessment of age-specific risk of hospitalisation among A(H7N9) virus infections. When possible, an ILI surveillance system that is capitated i.e. based on known population denominators, 37 rather than based on floating consultation denominators, would facilitate better characterization of rates of ILI in the population and laboratory data on a subset could be used to extrapolate the proportion of illnesses associated with influenza. 38 However, this is challenging in most settings without a defined population catchment.\n\nWe showed that reasonable estimates of the hospitalisation fatality risk had been available by mid May (Figure 3 ). During the SARS epidemic, reports of the case fatality risk were very low when based on number of deaths divided by number of cases cross-sectionally before the complete resolution of all cases, leading to substantial discussion and methodologic development during and after that epidemic. 20, 39, 40 Ten years later, during the present A(H7N9) outbreak, case fatality risks have frequently been communicated as around 20%, which is an underestimate. Clearly more work in dissemination of scientific methodologic findings and wider application in public health practice continues to be required. One interesting feature of our real-time analysis (Figure 3) is the decline over time in the estimated hospitalisation fatality risk, because death occurred more quickly on average than recovery (Figure 1 ). This is a limitation of existing methods, and methodologic developments would be welcome.\n\nThere are some limitations in our analyses. First, our estimates are real-time, calculated during the ongoing outbreak of A(H7N9) while some patients remain critically ill in hospital. Our estimates of hospitalisation fatality risks have fairly wide confidence intervals that will narrow as illnesses resolve. Second, while we were able to estimate age-specific hospitalisation fatality risks, we were not able to estimate age-specific symptomatic-case hospitalisation risks in the present analyses, and further work is needed in this area. Third, our estimates of the number of symptomatic A(H7N9) cases, by two methods, were based on extrapolation from the sentinel ILI network, and required a number of simplifying assumptions including complete ascertainment of hospitalised A(H7N9) cases and no changes in health-care seeking behaviour in late March and early April 2013 (Appendix). Our analysis may be biased if there were additional undetected hospitalisations associated with A(H7N9) for example because of lack of access to laboratory testing in some areas; or on the other hand more aggressive health-care attendance given the perceived severity of this novel infection. Fourth, without data on the proportion of subclinical or asymptomatic A(H7N9) virus infections we cannot estimate the infection fatality risk. Such information may be available from serologic studies in future. 41 Finally, clinical information on some laboratory-confirmed cases was not available, and standardized collection and sharing of clinical data would aid risk assessment and treatment. 42 In conclusion, our estimate of a symptomatic case fatality risk of between 160 and 2,800 deaths per 100,000 symptomatic cases places A(H7N9) below the severity of A(H5N1), 43 but above the severity of A(H1N1)pdm09. 44 We are not aware of comparative data on the symptomatic case fatality risks of seasonal influenza viruses but we speculate that they are of a similar order of magnitude to A(H1N1)pdm09. As with seasonal influenza, the severity of A(H7N9) increases with age. These findings will inform risk assessment and health policy during the current A(H7N9) outbreak, and preparations for a potential resurgence in human infections towards the end of 2013. 11 Our framework could be used for pandemic risk assessment of future avian influenza viruses that cause disease in humans.\n\nSystematic review-We searched PubMed on May 28, 2013, with the terms \"A(H7N9)\" or \"H7N9\" for articles published in English. We also searched articles in press and available online at international medical and infectious disease journals. Our search did not reveal any reports of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus before 2013. Some reports of the present outbreak of A(H7N9) in humans in China divided the number of deaths to date by the number of laboratory-confirmed cases to date, 9, 10, [28] [29] [30] and one of these studies clarified that this approach may underestimate the confirmed-case fatality risk since some patients remain hospitalised. 10 Other studies reported the number of laboratory-confirmed cases and the number of deaths to date without attempting to infer the case fatality risk. 1, 13, 18, 24, [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] There was one published study estimating a lower bound of at least 210-550 symptomatic A(H7N9) virus infections in China by April 21, 2013 based on patterns in incidence compared with presumed patterns in exposure. 17 We did not find any other published study that attempted to estimate the number of symptomatic cases of influenza A(H7N9) virus infection or the symptomatic case fatality risk.\n\nInterpretation-Our study showed that human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus may be on average less serious than previously reported. While most laboratoryconfirmed cases have required hospitalisation, and the majority of laboratory-confirmed hospitalised cases have required admission to intensive care units, the hospitalisation fatality risk for A(H7N9) of 36% appears to be lower than the hospitalisation fatality risk for A(H5N1) in China and elsewhere. Identification of five laboratory-confirmed cases in a network of 554 sentinel hospitals conducting ILI surveillance among outpatients in China is indicative of a much larger number of mild cases. Assuming either (1) that health-care seeking behavior was unchanged from A(H1N1)pdm09 in 2009 or (2) that all A(H7N9) cases with ILI sought care, we estimated symptomatic case fatality risks of (1) 160 or (2) 2,800 deaths per 100,000 symptomatic A(H7N9) virus infections, respectively. This places A(H7N9) below the severity of A(H5N1) but above the severity of A(H1N1)pdm09 and seasonal influenza.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.\n\nWe thank staff members of the Bureau of Disease Control and Prevention and Health Emergency Response Office of the National Health and Family Planning Commission and provincial and local departments of health for providing assistance with administration and data collection; staff members at county-, prefecture-, and provinciallevel CDCs in the provinces where human A(H7N9) cases occurred for providing assistance with field investigation, administration and data collection.
