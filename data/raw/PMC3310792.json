{"title": "Dengue Virus Infection Perturbs Lipid Homeostasis in Infected Mosquito Cells", "body": "In the past 20 years, it has become increasingly evident that lipids are important bioactive molecules that mediate signalling cascades and regulatory events in the cell. The ability to synthesize lipids predisposes an organism to function as a host to parasites that have lost or lack this trait [1]. Viruses as obligate parasites rely exclusively on the host to fulfill their membrane and lipid requirements. This is especially true for enveloped viruses since they utilize host-derived lipid membranes to facilitate release from infected cells by budding as well as to enter cells through membrane fusion. Lipids also form an integral structural component of the virus particle.\n\nFor most viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells, lipids are essential for the replication of viral genomes. Both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses induce extensive ultrastructural changes in infected cells. Host-derived membranes are rearranged to provide extensive platforms that help to assemble arrays of replication factories [2]\u2013[6]. Some of these factories are housed in specialized membrane compartments that assist in evading host antiviral defense mechanisms [2]\u2013[4], [7]. These compartments also function to increase the local concentration of molecules necessary for efficient viral RNA replication and particle assembly. Recent advances in electron tomography techniques have been instrumental in providing a three-dimensional perspective of these virus-induced membranes [2]\u2013[4], [7]. However, the metabolic cost to the host or vector and the contribution of lipid biosynthesis and trafficking to the formation of these replication factories is yet in its early stages of investigation [8]\u2013[12].\n\nIn this study, we have focused on the importance of lipid biosynthesis on dengue virus (DENV) replication. DENV is one of the most aggressive re-emerging pathogens worldwide [13]. Over two and a half billion people in more than 100 endemic countries are at risk for contracting dengue fever. Currently 50\u2013100 million cases of dengue fever are estimated annually [14]. Since DENV replicates within the mosquito vector as well as the human host, the spread of the virus can be greatly reduced by controlling the vector. Much effort has been placed in understanding the dynamics of virus transmission and replication in the mosquito vector, including identification of host proteins in the midgut and salivary glands that are regulated by DENV infection [15]\u2013[17]. Less is known about the global impact of DENV on host metabolic pathways.\n\nPrevious electron microscopy studies on DENV infected mosquito cells have shown that virus-induced membrane structures similar to those observed in human cells are prevalent [18]\u2013[19]. This extensive requirement in both host and vector, for intracellular membranes that support viral RNA replication and assembly suggest that quantifiable changes may exist in the lipid repertoire of the infected cell to assist in the formation of these membranes. Identifying these lipid changes that occur during infection is a necessary first step to discovering how DENV and its constituent proteins modify the lipid metabolism of cells. The reason(s) for such modifications has yet to be described, but can be pursued with a knowledge of which lipid changes occur. Furthermore, novel therapeutics that modify or inhibit these lipid changes and lipid-protein interactions could conceivably result in inhibition of virus replication.\n\nTo investigate these possibilities, we used high-resolution mass spectrometry methods to profile the lipidome of DENV infected mosquito cells. We have identified several lipid classes that are regulated by DENV infection. Many of these lipids have characteristic roles in influencing membrane architecture as well as functioning in cellular signal transduction pathways. Specifically, we have identified differences induced in the lipid profile upon virus binding and entry alone compared to those induced by viral RNA replication, assembly and egress. We have also profiled the lipidome of cells treated with an inhibitor of de novo phospholipid biosynthesis. Through this we have identified a lipid environment that supports cell survival but is yet inhibitory to DENV replication.\n\nIn this whole cell analysis, the primary PLs that were significantly regulated (Anova p<0.05) (and subsequently structurally identified) were mostly neutral or zwitterionic. PS was the only acidic lipid significantly regulated. At 36 hr post-infection, there was an \u223c2 fold up-regulation of PC species in DENV-infected cells compared to UV-DENV and mock controls (Figure 3A). At the later time point (60 hr post-infection), the relative levels of PC remained elevated in DENV-infected cells, however the differential expression between DENV and UV-DENV-exposed cells was not as evident (Figure 3B). Selected PC species were up regulated only at the 36 hr time point while others were up regulated at both time points (Figure 3C). Interestingly, a majority (\u223c80%) of the PC species that were up regulated had unsaturated fatty acyl chains.\n\nAnalysis of the overall fold change in PE at the 36 hr time point (Figure 3A) does not show a difference between the virus-exposed (DENV and UV-DENV) cells and the mock. This is due to an equal number of individual lipid molecular species being up regulated as were down regulated (Figure 3D). At the 60 hr time point the relative levels of PE in virus exposed cells were lower than mock levels (Figure 3B and D). There was also limited overlap between the specific PE molecular species regulated between DENV- and UV-DENV-exposed cells (Table S1). Given that insect cells have a high abundance of PE in their membranes (40\u201350%), it is interesting that there is a selective requirement for PC (over PE) in DENV-infected mosquito cells [22].\n\nAnother group of PLs that were preferentially expressed in DENV-infected cells were the lysophospholipids (LPLs) (Figure 3A and B). These lipids result primarily from the hydrolysis of PC by phospholipase A2-type enzymes (PLA2) and represent a PL that is missing an acyl chain [27]\u2013[30]. In DENV-infected cells, there was a preferential up regulation (\u223c3 fold) of these lipids compared to both UV-DENV and mock controls at the 36 hr time point. This expression was slightly down regulated at the 60 hr time point to about \u223c1.5 fold above the mock. In UV-DENV exposed cells, LPLs were undetectable at the 36 hr time point, while at the later time point, they were similar or slightly above the mock levels. As shown in figure 3H, LPLs with C16 acyl chains were up regulated at both time points while there was a selective up regulation of LPLs containing C18 acyl chains only at the early time point (Figure 3H). The C16 LPLs have been implicated in pro-apoptotic signaling pathways. This observation of selected LPL expression presents an attractive hypothesis that chain length differences may dictate specific roles for LPLs during virus infection.\n\nSince LPLs result from the activity of PLA2-type enzymes, we investigated whether DENV infected cells displayed a higher activity of PLA2 compared to uninfected cells. Utilizing a fluorescent PC substrate (BODIPY-PC) we used mass spectrometry to monitor the hydrolysis of PC to LPC by intracellular PLA2. Essentially, we monitored the production of BODIPY-LPC (resulting from PLA2 mediated metabolism of PC) during a time course of DENV infection (Figure S1) (method from [31]). The assay indicated that following 24 hr of infection and longer, PLA2 activity was elevated in DENV-infected cells compared to the controls, with the highest activity occurring at 48 and 72 hr post-infection. Therefore, the elevated levels of PLA2 could be the source of the LPL detected in DENV-infected cells.\n\nAlthough originally known as vital components of barrier membranes, sphingolipids are also potent bioactive molecules that regulate cell death, growth, differentiation and intracellular trafficking [32]\u2013[33]. The primary sphingolipids regulated during DENV infection were sphingomyelin (SM) and ceramide (CER). In DENV infected cells, SM was up regulated by \u223c2-fold compared to the controls (UV-DENV and mock) and remained elevated at both 36 hr and 60 hr time points (Figure 3A and B). Furthermore, this temporal expression varied depending on the specific molecular species being expressed (Figure 3E and Table S1). UV-DENV exposed cells showed similar levels of SM compared to the mock at the 36 hr time point, but these levels decreased at the later time point. Interestingly, an analog of SM known as ceramide phosphoethanolamine (CER-PE), was preferentially expressed (up regulated by \u223c2 fold) in UV-DENV exposed cells at the 36 hr time point (compared to DENV and mock) (Figure 3G). However, this expression level dropped below the mock at the later time point. In comparison, DENV infected cells showed very low expression of this lipid at the early time point (\u223c0.7 fold compared to mock) and its expression was undetectable at the later time point (Figure 3A and B). This lipid is expressed more abundantly in insect cells rather than in mammalian cells [23]\u2013[24].\n\nAnother bioactive sphingolipid, CER, results from either the degradation of SM by sphingomyelinases or de novo synthesis through the condensation of palmitate and serine [32], [34]. These lipids were preferentially up regulated in DENV-infected cells at both the 36 and 60 hr time points (\u223c2-fold compared to the mock). Since SM was also up regulated similarly in DENV infected cells, the rise in CER is possibly the result of de novo synthesis rather than SM degradation. UV-DENV-exposed cells showed undetectable CER levels at 36 hr, while at 60 hr the expression was (\u223c2 fold) above the mock control. Since there was a concurrent decrease in SM in UV-DENV exposed cells at 60 hr, the increased levels of CER in this case could be due to the degradation of SM resulting from increased cellular stress (resulting from incubation of the cells for 60 hr). Similar to other lipid species, CER also showed temporal regulation depending on the molecular species expressed (Figure 3F).\n\nAn overall comparison of the PLs regulated at the 36 and 60 hr time points indicated that in all lipid classes that were significantly regulated (Anova p<0.05) during DENV infection, selected molecular species were regulated only at the 36 hr time point while others were regulated at both time points. Representative examples for each lipid class are shown (Figure 3C\u2013H). These observations may represent lipidome differences in cells sustaining early but active DENV replication (36 hr) compared to those experiencing advanced cellular stress (60 hr). It is also interesting to note that any up regulation observed in UV-DENV exposed cells (at either time point) was only in the range of 1\u20131.5 fold compared to the mock control, while DENV infected cells showed much higher levels of expression.\n\nThere was an up regulation of phospholipids, sphingolipids and several bioactive intermediates in DENV infected cells compared to UV-DENV and mock controls (Figure 5A). Amongst the specific phospholipids expressed, PE was selectively up regulated in membrane fractions isolated from DENV infected cells (Figure 5B). However, the primary PE molecular species up regulated was a lysophospholipid (PE P-16:0e). Both DENV and UV-DENV exposed cells showed similar expression of fatty acids (Figure 5A). However, the individual molecular species expressed differed between the two viruses (Figure 5C). For instance, stearic acid was up regulated in DENV infected cells while oleic acid was up regulated in UV-DENV exposed cells. Palmitic acid had a similar level of expression in both DENV and UV-DENV exposed cells. Several bioactive intermediates such as monoacylglycerol (MG), diacylglycerol (DG) and phosphatidic acid (PA) were also prominently up regulated in DENV infected cells compared to the controls (Figure 5D).\n\nAlthough the Blygh and Dyer method [37] utilized for lipidomic analyses of whole cells or membrane fractions detected the expression of sphingolipids, Merrill et al optimized a protocol dedicated to analyzing sphingolipids without the interference from co-purifying PLs [38]. Utilizing this protocol, we carried out mass spectrometry analysis of these bioactive lipids from mosquito cells fractionated to provide three subcellular fractions: nuclear (N), cytoplasmic (CE) and membrane (16K). Similar to the above analyses, UV-DENV and mock infected cells were included as controls. The specific sphingolipids monitored included CER, SM, monohexosylceramide (GlcCER) and dihexosylceramide (GalCER).\n\nAs shown in Figure 6A, CER levels in C6/36 cells showed clear elevation in DENV-infected cells compared to mock-infected or UV-DENV exposed cells. Comparison of the different subcellular fractions indicated that the elevated CER was primarily concentrated in the CE fraction with the exception of two species (d18:1/16:0 and d18:0/16:0) which were enriched in the 16K pellet. These two species consist of the most abundant fatty acids observed in cells. The analysis of SM levels in mosquito cells (Figure 6B) indicated that virus exposed cells have a higher level of SM compared to mock-infected cells. This is most evident in the 16K pellet with the exception of the most abundant species (d18:1/20:0) that showed the highest levels in the CE. Comparison of infectious DENV to UV-DENV exposed cells indicates that the latter which is incapable of replication maintained higher levels of SM overall.\n\nGlcCER were primarily detected in the 16K pellet of both DENV infected and UV-DENV exposed cells (Figure 6C). However, the overall levels were down-regulated compared to the mock control with the exception of d18:1/16:0, which showed slight elevation in the UV-DENV exposed cells. Dihexosylceramides were not detected to significant levels in any of the samples.\n\nThe FAS inhibitor, C75 is a potent inhibitor of DENV replication in both mosquito (Figure 1) and mammalian cells [20]. Cells treated with non-cytotoxic concentrations of C75 (<50 \u00b5M) induce an environment that has redistributed its lipid repertoire to support cell survival in the absence of FAS activity, and yet, this environment does not support viral replication. To determine the basis for this exclusion of virus replication, we profiled the lipidome of cells treated with 25 \u00b5M C75. Membrane fractions isolated from DENV infected and mock control cells in the presence or absence of C75 were profiled. A hierarchical clustering analysis of the lipidomic data (Figure S3) indicated that the lipid environment of DENV infected cells treated with C75 clustered very closely to the mock C75 treated control and was furthest from DENV infected cells suggesting that the two represent significantly different environments. A comparative analysis of the lipid species expressed in the two environments indicated that a majority of the lipids that were up regulated in DENV infected cells were down regulated upon treatment of those cells with C75.\n\nAmongst the phospholipids, several phosphatidylinositol species were up regulated 3\u20134 fold in the untreated DENV infected cells compared to the C75 treated cells (Figure 7B). However, none of these PI species were phosphorylated. A single species of PG was also up regulated by over 5 fold in the untreated cells. Since C75 disrupts the formation of lipids down stream of FAS, several fatty acids (stearic and palmitic acid) were down regulated in the drug treated cells. An enrichment of these fatty acids was observed in the untreated cells upon comparison with C75 treated cells (Figure 7C). In contrast, as observed in the previous comparison of DENV infected cells to uninfected cells (Figure 5), oleic acid was down-regulated in untreated DENV infected cells and therefore, showed enrichment in C75 treated cells. Interestingly, C75 treated cells also showed a down regulation of metabolic intermediates such as mono- and diacylglycerol as well as phosphatidic acid. Enrichment of these lipids was observed in untreated DENV infected cells compared to C75 treated cells (Figure 7D). In addition to the phospholipids, de novo synthesis of sphingolipids was also disrupted by C75. Key intermediates in this pathway such as N-palmitoylesphingosine and N-stearoylesphingosine were down regulated upon treatment of cells with C75 and up regulated in untreated DENV infected cells (Figure 7A and Table S3).\n\nIt has been previously reported that de novo lipid biosynthesis was up regulated during DENV infection [20]. Consistent with these observations, several primary fatty acids (palmitic, stearic and oleic acid) involved in the biosynthesis of higher order PLs were detected in our lipidomic analyses. Palmitic acid is the first fatty acid of the lipogenesis pathway and stearic acid (C18:0), is immediately downstream of palmitic acid. They are both up regulated in DENV infected cells. The latter is the precursor to the biosynthesis of oleic acid (C18:1) or long chain fatty acids (with acyl chains of C20 or greater). Interestingly, since oleic acid is down regulated in DENV-infected cells stearic acid may be stimulating long chain FA biosynthesis. However, a majority of the PLs expressed in DENV infected cells have C16- or C18-acyl chains with varying degrees of unsaturation. Therefore, it seems that desaturation of palmitic and stearic acid rather than elongation may be the chosen pathway for lipogenesis during DENV infection.\n\nSeveral intermediates in lipid catabolism were also detected in the replication complex membranes (palmitic acid, MG and DG). Analysis of these intermediates suggested the up regulation of pathways for PC hydrolysis and triacylglycerol (TG) metabolism. The latter pathway is responsible for regulating lipid homeostasis and energy production in the cell through the metabolism of lipid droplets [49]. Through the action of lipases the degradation of lipid droplets results in the release of palmitic acid, DG and MG [36]. These metabolic products are substrates for mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation as well as intermediates (fatty acids) in the synthesis of new lipids. DENV infected cells show a high prevalence of these species compared to mock infected cells.\n\nWhile several acidic phospholipid species were detected in the 16K membrane fraction very few were significantly regulated during infection. Previous studies in mammalian cells have indicated the importance of acidic lipids in DENV infection [46], [50]. These negatively charged lipids are also implicated in influencing membrane structure.\n\nThe most striking results were obtained by the comparison of DENV infected cells in the presence and absence of the FAS inhibitor, C75. It is well established that treatment of cells with this inhibitor disrupts de novo phospholipid biosynthesis [51]. To circumvent this inhibition, the cell redistributes its lipid repertoire to ensure cell survival. However, this redistribution does not support DENV replication. A comparison of the different lipid environments indicated that many of the lipids that were up regulated in DENV infected cells compared to cells treated with C75, were similar to those previously observed when infected cells were compared to mock (uninfected) controls. Therefore, comparison of DENV infected cells to two different controls (uninfected cells and C75 treated infected cells) highlighted the same lipids as being up regulated during an active DENV infection.\n\nIn these studies we utilized UV-DENV as a control to identify lipid metabolic changes that occurred upon virus binding and entry alone. This virus is incapable of replication but immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-NS3 antibodies have indicated that there is a very low level of translation that occurs within the first 24 hr (data not shown). Analysis of the lipidome of UV-DENV exposed cells showed a significant difference in the phospholipid and sphingolipid content in comparison to DENV infected cells and the mock control. It is possible that binding, membrane fusion and entry alone, or the expression of viral proteins from the incoming viral RNA triggers the activation of lipases or lipid transport mechanisms that result in the differences observed in the lipidome of the cells. This has been shown for other viruses. Jan et al. have shown that binding and entry alone of Sindbis virus triggered the activation of sphingomyelinases that degraded membrane bound SM to Cer [52]. It has also been shown that viruses induced apoptotic-signaling cascades upon binding and entry alone [53]\u2013[55]. These cascades may either result from or induce lipolysis or lipid transfer between compartments in the cell.\n\nThe most pronounced changes are those observed in the 16K pellet analyses where a significant decrease in phospholipids, sphingolipids and lipid intermediates are observed (compared to mock cells, Figure 5A). A comparison of SM and CER in the whole cell analysis at the 36 hr and 60 hr time points (Figure 1A and 1B) indicated a reduction in SM with a corresponding increase in CER with time. This could be due to a similar scenario to SINV where a non-replicating UV-DENV is capable of inducing lipid conversion in membranes [52]. Therefore, SM and other sphingolipids may be converted to CER that is transported away from the 16K membrane fraction to other locations in the cell. This is also evident from the increased content of fatty acids compared to mock cells that may result from the degradation of lipids. UV-DENV exposed cells do not show significant regulation of MG or DG, but show an up regulation of palmitic acid (C16:0). Virus binding and entry alone could stimulate lipid droplet hydrolysis (catabolism of TG) resulting in the release of palmitic acid. These studies have shown that UV-DENV could be a versatile tool to pursue mechanistic studies on the metabolic pertabations that occur upon virus binding, membrane fusion, and entry.\n\nIn summary, using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we have determined that DENV drastically alters the lipid profile of infected cells. Specifically, DENV infection elevates the expression of lipids that have the capacity to change the physical properties of the bilayer such as bilayer curvature, permeability, and the recruitment and assembly of protein complexes in the membrane. Several of the identified molecules also function as bioactive messengers that control signaling and membrane trafficking pathways in the cells. They represent molecules that result from the activation of cellular stress pathways that respond to viral infections. Based on these findings, the next steps will be to investigate the mechanisms of how these lipid species play a role in DENV replication, as well as identify the control points in these pathways that may be influenced by viral gene products.\n\nC6/36 (Aedes albopictus) cells (ATCC) were maintained in Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) supplemented with glutamine (2 mM), non-essential amino acids, 25 mM Hepes and 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum. Dengue virus 2, strain 16681 (obtained from Richard Kinney, CDC. Ft. Collins) stocks were amplified in C6/36 cells in MEM (supplemented as above) and 2% heat inactivated fetal calf serum. UV-inactivated DENV was obtained by exposing the same virus stock (used for infection) to UV-light for 3 hr and then conformation of inactivation by two blind passages of the virus on cells for 60 hr per passage. Lack of infectivity was confirmed by plaque assay and immunofluorescence assay.\n\nFor infection, \u223c5\u00d7108 C6/36 cells were infected with DENV at a MOI of 20 at 30\u00b0C. Infection of all cells (required for lipidomic analyses) was confirmed by immunofluorescence analyses. Each experiment included three biological replicates. Following infection, cells were harvested at 36 and 60 hr post-infection, pelleted and resuspended in 100 \u00b5l of 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Lipids were extracted from an equal number of cells using a modified Bligh and Dyer protocol. Briefly, a mixture of 2\u22361 Chloroform\u2236methanol, 0.1% acetic acid and 0.01% butylated hydroxy toluene (BHT) were added to the cell suspension in ammonium bicarbonate such that there was a 4\u22361 ratio of organic solvent to cells. Following lipid extraction, the organic phase was separated from the aqueous phase by centrifugation and dried down under a N2 stream in low retention microfuge tubes (Fisher). The dried lipids were resuspended in 75 ml of methanol and vortexed for 10 s. The samples were then centrifuged at 13,400\u00d7 g for 5 min to remove any particulates.\n\nLipid molecular species were profiled using a dual-column nanocapillary LC system equipped with 75 \u00b5m\u00d765 cm columns, each packed with 3 \u00b5m Jupiter particles (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The mobile phases were (A) 10 mM ammonium acetate in 50\u223650 water/methanol (v/v) and (B) 10 mM ammonium acetate in 50\u223650 methanol/acetonitrile (v/v). The LC system was equilibrated at 10,000 psi with mobile phase A prior to injecting 0.4 \u00b5L of sample. Exponential gradient elution was initiated 50 min after sample loading with an initial column flow of \u223c300 nL/min. After 90 min of gradient separation, the mobile phase mixer was purged with 3 mL of mobile phase B, followed by a 5 min column wash. Finally, the mobile phase mixer was purged with 10 mL of mobile phase A, which represented the end of one separation cycle. While gradient elution was performed on one column, the other column was equilibrated with mobile phase A. The LC system was coupled to a hybrid linear ion-trap-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher, San Jose, CA), and the capillary temperature and electrospray voltage were 200\u00b0C and +2.2 kV, respectively. The Orbitrap was used as the mass analyzer during MS survey scans over the m/z range 200\u20132000 with a duty cycle of \u223c1.2 s. Data-dependant MS/MS was performed in the LTQ for the top 5 ions, with a normalized collision energy of \u223c35%. Dynamic exclusion in the LTQ during data-dependant MS/MS experiments was enabled as follows: repeat count of 2, repeat duration of 30 s, exclusion list size of 250, and exclusion duration of 60 s.\n\nLC-MS datasets, defined as the data obtained from a single LC-MS analysis, were processed using the PRISM Data Analysis system [56], a series of software tools freely available at http://ncrr.pnl.gov/software/ and developed in-house. The first step involved deisotoping of the raw MS data to give the monoisotopic mass, charge state, and intensity of the major peaks in each mass spectrum using Decon2LS [16]. The data were next examined in a 2-D fashion using MultiAlign to identify groups of mass spectral peaks that were observed in sequential spectra using an algorithm [57] that computes a Euclidean distance in n-dimensional space for combinations of peaks. Each group, generally ascribed to one detected species and referred to as a \u201cfeature\u201d, has a median monoisotopic mass, central normalized elution time (NET), and abundance estimate computed by summing the intensities of the MS peaks that comprise the entire LC-MS feature. LC-MS features were then chromatographically aligned across all datasets using the LCMSWARP algorithm [58] in MultiAlign, and the lipid identities of detected features were initially determined by comparing their measured monoisotopic masses and NETs to calculated monoisotopic masses and observed NETs for lipids in an AMT tag database [59] within search tolerances of \u00b13 ppm and \u00b10.03 NET for monoisotopic mass and elution time, respectively. Subsequent identifications of lipid features that did not match to entries in the AMT tag database were made by searching their molecular weights against entries in the Lipid MAPS database followed by manual confirmation based on MS/MS spectra.\n\nFollowing chromatographic alignment and database matching, the abundances of all detected features (both AMT tag database matched and unmatched) were loaded into DAnTE [60] for statistical analysis. Feature abundances were transformed to log2 scale then subjected to central tendency normalization [61]. Comparative data analysis was then performed and statistically significant differences between the lipid profiles of the samples were determined using ANOVA. Partial least-squares (PLS) [62] analysis was also performed using the data matrices containing either AMT tag database matched features alone or all features (both database matched and unmatched).\n\nVirus infection of C6/36 cells was carried out as described for the whole cell analyses. To label newly synthesized lipids, Acetic Acid, Sodium Salt, [1-14C] (Perkin Elmer) was added to cell supernatants at 8 hr post-infection. At 12 hr post-infection, the label containing supernatant was removed and new medium was added to the cells. At 36 and 60 hr post-infection, cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed with buffer A (35 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 146 mM NaCl, 11 mM glucose). Cells were then osmotically shocked in buffer B (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgOAc and 1 mM DTT) for 30 min on ice, homogenized and centrifuged at 1500\u00d7 g, at 4\u00b0C for 5 min to remove nuclei. Post-nuclear supernatants were centrifuged at 16000\u00d7 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C to obtain a membrane pellet (referred to as the 16K pellet). The supernatant post nuclear and membrane fractionation is referred to as the cytoplasmic extract (CE). Total RNA was extracted from each fraction (16K and CE) using Trizol reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following RNA extraction, total lipids were extracted using the Bligh and Dyer method mentioned above and counted using a Beckman LS 6000 scintillation counter. The viral RNA in each fraction was measured using the SuperScript III Platinum SYBR Green One-Step qPCR Kit with ROX and DENV specific primers; (forward) 5\u2032 ACAAGTCGAACAACCTGGTCCAT 3\u2032 and (reverse) 5\u2032 GCCGCACCATTGGTCTTCTC 3\u2032 on a Applied Biosystems 7300 Real Time PCR machine. The labeled lipid in subcellular fractions was standardized to the total RNA isolated from each fraction prior to determining the viral RNA genome copies per labeled lipid in subcellular fractions.\n\nFor profiling the lipidome of the replication complex membranes, lipids were extracted from the 16K pellet using the same modified Blygh and Dyer protocol described above.\n\nA LTQ Orbitrap XL instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific San Jose, CA) was used for the analysis. It was coupled to an Agilent 1100 series LC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) equipped with a micro well plate auto sampler and binary pumping device. Reverse phase liquid chromatography was used to analyze the samples. An Agilent Eclipse XDB-C8 column with 2.1\u00d7150 mm, 3.5 \u00b5m dimensions was used for the separation. Solvent A consisted of water +0.1% piperidine. Solvent B contained acetonitrile \u2236 methanol (50\u223650 v/v) +0.1% piperidine. The flow rate was 300 \u00b5L/minute. A volume of 10 \u00b5L was loaded onto the column. The gradient was as follows: time 0 minutes, 50% B; time 25 minutes, 95% B; time 45 minutes, 95% B; time 50 minutes, 50% B; time 60 minutes, 50% B. The MS analysis used negative polarity electrospray ionization. The source voltage was 4.0 kV, source current 100 \u00b5A, capillary voltage \u221230.0 V, tube lens voltage \u2212100.0 V. The capillary temperature was 200\u00b0C, sheath gas flow was 35, auxiliary and sweep gas were both set to 0. Data were acquired using data dependent scanning mode. FTMS resolution of 60,000 with a mass range of 70\u20131200 was used for full scan analysis and the ITMS was used for MS/MS data acquisition. The top three most intense ions were acquired with a minimum signal of 500, isolation width of 2, normalized collision energy of 35, default charge state of 1, activation Q of 0.250, and an activation time of 30.0. The samples were evaluated with Thermo XCalibur software (version 2.1.0) and downstream alignment done with an in-house data processing package called Omics Discovery Pipeline [63], [64].\n\nThe method was slightly modified from [65]. Briefly, each sample was extracted according to published protocol then dried and reconstituted in 100 \u00b5L of methanol \u2236 water \u2236 formic acid (74\u223625\u22361) containing 5 mM ammonium formate. An Agilent 6400 QQQ (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was used for analysis coupled to an 1100 Series LC equipped with HPLC Chip interface (Agilent Technologies Santa Clara, CA). Solvent A consisted of methanol \u2236 water \u2236 formic acid (74\u223625\u22361) containing 5 mM ammonium formate and solvent B methanol \u2236 formic acid (99\u22361) containing 5 mM ammonium formate. The gradient was as follows: time 0 minutes, 20% B; time 1 minute, 20% B; time 3 minutes, 100% B; time 23 minutes, 100% B; time 24 minutes, 20% B; time 30 minutes, 20% B. The flow rate was 0.4 \u00b5L/min. Data were acquired in MRM mode with transitions and collision energy according to Merrill et al [65] with the following source conditions: gas temperature 300\u00b0C, gas flow 4 L/minute, capillary voltage 1900 V. The fragmentor voltage was set to 180 V in all cases. Data were processed with Agilent Mass Hunter software version B03.01.\n\nC6/36 cells were infected with DENV at an MOI of 3. Following adsorption, virus was removed and the cells were washed and overlayed with media containing varying concentrations of C75 [51]. The vehicle for C75 was ethanol. Virus supernatants were harvested at 24 hr post-infection and virus titer assayed by plaque assay. Cytotoxicity of C75 was simultaneously assayed using the Quick Cell Proliferation Kit (Abcam). Time of addition of C75: C6/36 cells were infected with DENV as described above. At the indicated time points, 6.3 \u00b5M C75 was added to the cells. Cells were harvested at 24 hr post-infection and the amount of released virus was determined by plaque assay. For the lipidomic studies, cells were infected with DENV (as described above) or left uninfected. Following adsorption of the virus at room temperature for 2 hr, C75 was added to the media in the overlay, and cells were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 36 hr. Sample preparation, lipid extraction and mass spectrometry analyses were carried out as described above for the fractionated (16K pellet) samples.\n\nThe lipid samples were reconstituted in 100 \u00b5L of methanol \u2236 water \u2236 formic acid (74\u223625\u22361) containing 5 mM ammonium formate and analyzed with an Agilent 6400 QQQ (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) coupled to an 1100 Series LC equipped with HPLC Chip interface (Agilent Technologies Santa Clara, CA). Solvent A consisted of methanol \u2236 water \u2236 formic acid (74 \u2236 25 \u2236 1) containing 5 mM ammonium formate and solvent B methanol \u2236 formic acid (99 \u2236 1) containing 5 mM ammonium formate. The gradient was as follows: time 0 minutes, 40% B; time 5 minute, 70% B; time 7 minutes, 100% B; time 9 minutes, 100% B; time 9 minutes, 40% B; time 13 minutes, 40% B. The flow rate was 0.4 \u00b5L/min. Data were acquired for parent ions corresponding to the BODIPY-PC (986.9 m/z) and BODIPY LCP (320.2 m/z) in single ion monitoring (SIM) mode with the following source conditions: gas temperature 300\u00b0C, gas flow 4 L/minute, capillary voltage 1900 V. The fragmentation voltage was set to 200 V in all cases. Data were processed with Agilent Mass Hunter software version B03.01.\n\nSupplemental data include three figure and three tables."}
