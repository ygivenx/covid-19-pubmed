{"title": "Effect of continuous renal replacement therapy on all-cause mortality in COVID-19 patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation: a retrospective cohort study", "body": "East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). 2 As of March 9 th , 2020, COVID-19 has infected more than 100,000 people worldwide and caused more than 3,500 deaths, and the data are still increasing; in Wuhan, the fatality rate of COVID-19 was 4.8% (2404/49965). Of note, critically ill patients with COVID-19 have a high mortality rate. In a study of 52 critically ill patients in Wuhan, 32 (61.5%) patients died at 28 days and the mortality rate was 81.1% (30/37) in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. 3 Accumulated evidence has strongly demonstrated that systemic inflammatory response, acute kidney injury (AKI) and fluid overload (FO) were associated with high mortality in severe sepsis. [4] [5] [6] In critically ill patients with COVID-19, the overwhelming inflammation including C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) were observed, 7-10 which is consistent with patients suffering from SARS-CoV 11 and MERS-CoV. 12 Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is a great help in critically ill patients not only to control of electrolyte, acid-base derangements but also to remove inflammatory mediators and improves oxygenation in fluid overload. [13] [14] [15] CRRT has been applied to critically ill patients, including patients with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and other viral infectious diseases such as Ebola virus disease. 14, 16 However, the benefits of CRRT are still no consistent conclusion in critically ill patients. 17 CRRT significantly reduced the level of IL-6 and decreases hospital mortality rate in pediatric severe sepsis, especially in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 18 Besides, a meta-analysis revealed that patients who received CRRT had significantly lower mortality compared to conventional therapy. 19 Hoverer, CRRT was associated with increased mortality in patients with MERS-CoV. 16 The relationship between CRRT and patients' outcome varied in patients with the different disease and was effected by the modalities, anticoagulation, vascular access management, timing of initiation and intensity of CRRT. 17, 20, 21 To date, no specific treatment has been confirmed to be effective for COVID-19, and supportive treatment remains essential. As far as we know, the effect of CRRT on critically ill patients with COVID-19 has not been reported. In this retrospective cohort study, we aimed to explore the effect of CRRT on all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation and the risk factors for mortality in patients with CRRT treatment.\n\n). The laboratory data were collected throughout the study as follows: routine blood test, blood glucose, total cholesterol, hypersensitive Creactive protein (hCRP), procalcitonin, ferritin, coagulation function, liver and renal function, lactic acid, high sensitive cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and inflammatory factors, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-2 receptor, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1. All information is obtained and managed through established data collection forms. Two researchers independently reviewed and collected the data.\n\nWe performed CRRT with an ultrafiltration rate of 25-75 mL/kg/hr, performed using commercially available pump-driven machines (PrismaFlex, Gambro, Sweden; or multiFiltrate, Fresenius, Germany) and filter (M150, Gambro; Oxiris, Baxter; or AV1000s, Fresenius). For the patients with AKI, hemofiltration plus hemodialysis were performed. The blood flow rate was set on 2.5-4 mL/kg/min, and the clearance rate was set on 40-75 mL/min. The filter circuit was prewashed with saline containing 5,000-6,250 IU/L heparin. Vascular access was obtained with 13.5F central venous catheters (Covidien, MA, USA) in femoral vein.\n\nWe followed up all patients through electronic hospital medical records. The outcome was death.\n\nAll patients were followed until death or March 9 th , and all survivors were followed for at least one week. There was no loss to follow-up patients.\n\nNumeric data were presented as the means and standard deviation (SD) or medians (interquartile range [IQR]) and were analyzed using Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test depending on the data distribution. Categorical variables were displayed as frequencies and percentages and were analyzed using the Chi-squared test. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival, and the log-rank test was used to evaluate differences between the two groups. The Cox regression model was conducted to adjust for potential confounders, including age, sex, the baseline values, and the average values of all tests between the start of invasive mechanical ventilation and the endpoint. Univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed for all-cause mortality, the significant variants in the univariate analysis and the variables which have clinical significance were selected for inclusion in a multivariate \"backward\" stepwise Cox regression analysis. SPSS 23.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY) statistical software was used for statistical analysis. GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, USA) was used for statistical analysis and visualization. A P-value of 0.05 or less was considered significant.\n\nResearch funders were not involved in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation or report writing. The corresponding authors had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\n\nIn total, 36 COVID-19 patients with invasive mechanical ventilation were enrolled in the study. Table 1 showed the baseline characteristics of the cohort patients. There were 30 men (83.3%) and 6 women (16.7%), ranging in age from 44 and 86 years. Common comorbidity factors in COVID-19 patients with invasive mechanical ventilation were hypertension (n=14, 38.9%) and cardiac disease (n=12, 33.3%). The mean/median level of inflammatory markers (including white blood cell count, neutrophil count, hCRP, procalcitonin, and ferritin) and cardiac injury biomarkers (including hs-cTnI and NT-proBNP) were higher than normal.\n\nWe divided the study participants into two groups according to the CRRT treatment.\n\nTwenty-two patients received CRRT (CRRT group) while fourteen patients did not (non-CRRT group). There was no difference between two groups in baseline age, sex, comorbidities, complications, treatments and most of the laboratory findings, except for patients received CRRT with higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase (p=0.034) and serum creatinine (p=0.017).\n\nAll rights reserved.

During the follow-up, 12 of 22 (54.5%) patients in CRRT group and 11 of 14 (78.6%) patients in non-CRRT group died. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients in CRRT group fared prolonged survival than those in non-CRRT group (P=0.032) ( Figure 1 ).\n\nIn Cox regression analysis, seven different models were used to analyze the adjusted hazard ratio of CRRT treatment. Consistently, the association between CRRT treatment and a reduced risk of mortality remained significant after adjusting for selected confounding factors, such as age, sex, the baseline laboratory findings, or the average values of all tests between the start of invasive mechanical ventilation and the endpoint. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of CRRT treatment fluctuated between 0.283 and 0.424 (Table 2) .\n\nWe further conducted univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis for all-cause mortality of COVID-19 patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation with CRRT. After adjusting the prognostic significance of clinical factors including age, sex, inflammatory factors, coagulation function, liver, and renal function, and cardiac function, we demonstrated that older age (aHR=1.112, P=0.025), higher levels of IL-1\u03b2 (aHR=1.292, P=0.012), IL-2 receptor (aHR=1.002, P=0.013), hs-cTNI (aHR=1.001, P=0.004), and NT-proBNP (aHR=1.256, P=0.008) were significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality ( Table 3 ).\n\nTo our knowledge, this current study is the first cohort study to estimate the association between CRRT treatment and mortality of COVID-19 patients with invasive mechanical ventilation.

The mean/median level of inflammatory markers, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2 receptor, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, white blood cell count, neutrophil count, hCRP, procalcitonin, and ferritin were higher than normal.\n\nFor example, the average of peaks for IL-6 was 1081.7 pg/mL, which was more than 100 times higher than the upper limit of normal value (reference range: < 7 pg/mL). Inflammatory storm may originate from the following aspects. First, SARS-Cov-2 infects patients by binding human ACE2, 29, 30 which is widely expressed in multiple organs throughout the body. 31 SARS-CoV-2 might lead to multi-system inflammation through ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway and ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway. 32, 33 Second, it was reported that antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 due to prior exposure to other coronaviruses might also be involved in COVID-19. ADE can elicit sustained inflammation, lymphopenia, and/or cytokine storm, which makes it a possible explanation for the geographic limitation of severe cases. 34 Third, combined infections may lead to a more severe systemic inflammatory response. Indeed, in our study, some patients combined with infection in other organs (e.g. urinary tract, blood) and other pathogen (e.g. influenza virus, fungus). Fourth, shock, hypoxemia and coagulation pathway abnormalities in critical patients could aggravate systemic inflammatory response, which become a vicious cycle, threatening life. 35, 36 In our study, CRRT was associated with prolonged survival in COVID-19 patients with invasive mechanical ventilation. CRRT is a widely used blood purification therapy, which achieves a high solute clearance rate through diffusion, convection, ultrafiltration, and adsorption. The primary goal of CRRT is to compensate for the loss of renal function and associated sequelae, including uremic toxins, electrolyte disturbances, metabolic acidosis, and volume overload 37 . Besides these, CRRT can also remove cytokines from the bloodstream. Emerging evidence has shown that CRRT was associated with significantly lower mortality in patients with severe sepsis. 18, 19, 38 In addition, in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, CRRT could remove All rights reserved.

[39] [40] [41] However, it is controversial whether CRRT is beneficial in viral pneumonia. CRRT was reported to have a positive effect on the treatment of adenovirus pneumonia 42 .\n\nWhile other studies revealed that CRRT was a risk factor for mortality in patients with MERS-CoV 16 Although CRRT treatment improved patient survival, 54.5% of patients with CRRT treatment died during our follow-up. In patients with CRRT, we further explored the risk factors for death for better management and treatment. We derived that older age, and higher levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-2 receptor, hs-cTnI, and NT-proBNP were independently associated with a higher allcause mortality in patients with CRRT.\n\nIL-1\u03b2 is known as a lymphocyte-stimulating factor, produced by activated monocytemacrophages. 45, 46 It plays an immunomodulatory role to induce synthesis of acute phase protein causing fever and cachexia, active antigen-presenting cell and T cells, and promote the proliferation and secretion of antibodies of B cells in innate and acquired immunity. 47-49 IL-2 receptor is widely expressed on the surface of IL-2 target cells, including T cells, B cells, and monocyte macrophage, promoting cytotoxic action, secretion of the antibody, production of IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b2, TGF-\u03b2 and non-specific cytotoxins. [50] [51] [52] Elevated levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-2 receptor were associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality in patients with CRRT, indicating that overactive inflammation and immune responses might still be risk factors for death. Inflammatory mediators and biomarkers need to be timely monitored and other effective interventions need to be explored. All rights reserved.

Elevated cTnI in serumreflects damage to cardiomyocytes with a high myocardial specificity. 53 Patients with increased cTnI levels showed higher in-ICU mortality of pneumonia. 54 NT-proBNP is a natural hormone with biological activity synthesized by cardiomyocytes and mainly expressed in the ventricle. The rapid synthesis and release of NT-proBNP into the blood due to myocardial dilation regulate the cardiac function among patients with left ventricular dysfunction. NT-proBNP cutoffs of 4000 pg/mL optimally predicted short-term mortality in patients with sepsis. 55 Therefore, COVID-19 patients with elevated cTnI and NT-proBNP should be given enough attention and active treatment.\n\nThere were some limitations to our experiment. First, it is retrospective in design, warranting a prospective double-blind randomized controlled study. Second, the sample size of this study is not large enough. Third, as it is just a single-center study; multicenter studies are needed for further confirmation.\n\nIn summary, we demonstrated that CRRT could improve COVID-19 patients' survival, and might be an independent protective factor for COVID-19 patients' survival, and might be an independent protective factor for COVID-19 patients with invasive mechanical ventilation. In patients undergoing CRRT, older age, and higher levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-2 receptor, hs-cTnI, and NT-proBNP were independently associated with higher all-cause mortality. Further prospective multicenter studies with larger sample sizes are required.\n\nAll authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n\nWith the permission of the corresponding authors, we can provide participant data without names and identifiers, but not the study protocol, statistical analysis plan, or informed consent form.
