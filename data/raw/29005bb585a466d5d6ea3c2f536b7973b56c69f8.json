{"title": "Etymology of Loa", "body": "To ask what ~s new in Entamoeba histolytica research, one need look no further than the surface of th~s protozoan parasite. In the past year the cloning and partial characterization of five different surface antigens have been reported, a remarkable result of international research efforts against arneb~asls. One of these proteins is the f~rst protective immunogen identified in the antrnal model of amebic liver abscess Barbara Mann and William Petri review these recent results, propose a nomenclature for the gone family of E. histolytica galactose lectins and discuss the roles of the different surface proteins in adhesion.\n\nNear the turn of the century a 29-yearold physician sought medical care for prolonged dysentery and fever. Before returning to the United States, he had resided in Panama for almost six years. Sir William Osier examined the patient and noted that:\n\nHis general condition was very good. considering that he had had severe dysentery and an ~rregular fever for more than two months. The liver was shghtly enlarged anteriorly but not speoally sensitive. Poslenorly, there seemed to be a very dist,nct extension of the dulness [sic] upward. He had s~x or eight mucold stools with traces of blood da,ly. I saw hqm subsequently on four occasions and the symptoms remained practically the same. The temperature rose each day to about 103\u00b0...\n\nThe suspicion entertained at first that he had abscess of the hver was gradually confirmed, and on March 22nd Dr Tiffany aspirated, and then Inosed and drained two large abscess cavities in the right lobe of the hver. The pus was thick, of creamy consistence, in color, in places shghtly balestained, but it has not the reddishbrown and anchovy-sauce-hke appearance presented by the pus in many cases of hepatic abscesses.\n\nI made an exam,nat~on of the pus at the Biological Laboratory, within three-quarters of an hour of its w~thdrawal and found in ~t. in large numbers, the amoebae which Kartuhs had described.\n\nAfter the operation the dysenteric symptoms d~d not abate in the shghtest; he conbnued to have from eight to s~xteen movements daily. On each day there were found in these stools many characteristic examples of the amoebae... The general character of the amoebae corresponded ~n every particular w~th those found ~n the liver.\n\nIt ~s impossib!e to speak as yet w~th any certainty as to the relation of these organisms to the dtsease. The subject is deserwng of extended study.\n\nThe patient died on 5 April ~. It was one year later, in 189 I, that Osler's colleagues Councilman and Lafleur published the key paper 'Amoebic Dysentery' in the Johns Hopkins Hospital Report 2. In it they described the pathology of amebic colitis and liver abscess, including the invasion through the intestinal epithelium by the amebae, and emphasized the lack of contribution of intestinal bacteria to the cohtis and liver abscess.\n\nThe occasion of the 100th anniversary of this landmark monograph is an opportune time to review recent advances ~n the study of this protozoon that remains a worldwide cause of human suffering. We will arbitrarily hmit our discussion to the five surface proteins whose sequences have been reported, and not cover other potentially important but less well-characterized surface molecules that have been described, such as the fibronectin receptor 3, neuramin~dase 4, phospholipase A 5, surface sialoglycoproteins 6. the 112 kilodalton (kDa) adhesin 7, the chitotriose lectin 8 and the 30kDa 9~\u00b0 and 90kDa' ~ surface antigens.\n\nA serine-rich protein has been identified by Stanley and colleagues by differential hybridization screening of an E. histolytica complementary (c)DNA library,2. The library was constructed from E. hlstolytica strain HMI: IMSS and screened with radiolabeled cDNA from HMI:IMSS and the non-E, hlstolytica Laredo strain. Several clones that hy-brid~zed with HMI:IMSS and not Laredo cDNA were identified and one 0.7 k~lobase (kb) cDNA sequenced, This E. histolyt~ca-specific cDNA contains two open reading frames (ORF), Antibodies produced to trpE fusion proteins using the first but not the second ORF recognized E. h~stolytica proteins on western blots. Human immune sera and rabbit anti-/:, histolytica antiserum recognized the fusion protein using \u00a9RFI and not ORF2, which suggests that ORF2 is not translated in the trophozoites, Surprisingly, antibodies raised to the ORFI fusion protein identify E. hlstolytica proteins, which at 46 and 52 kDa are twice the size predicted from the cDNA sequence (25kDa). Post-translational modifications have been speculated to be involved but have not been shown to account for the difference in molecular weight, The proteins recognized by the ORFI fusion protein antiserum were present in a 100000g pellet of sonicated trophozoites and therefore are likely to be associated with membranes or vesicles.\n\nThe structure of the serine-rich protein encoded by ORFI shares similarities wrth the malaria circumsporozoite proteins. The amino terminus contains a 13 amino acid putative signal sequence that is followed by a region of charged amino acids. The center of the protein contains tandem octapeptide and dodecapeptide repeats, with a 13amino acid hydrophobic carboxy-terminus domain. There are no potential sites for N-linked glycosylation.\n\nA function for the serine-rich protein in amebic adhesion has been proposed based on the finding that a 1:10 dilution of antiserum to the ORFI-trpE fusion protein inhibits adherence to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 1021 cells by 70%, The same investigators have shown in an earlier paper that amebic adherence to this cell line can be inhibited by 78% w~th N-acetyl lactosamine. As the serine-rich protein is distinct from the F. histolytica galactose and N-acetyl lactosamine binding adhesin (see below), the effect of the ORFI fusion protein antiserum on adherence may have been indqrect, leaving the function of the serine-rich protein yet to be defined.\n\nScreening of an expression cDNA library (constructed from E. h~stolytica strain H-302:NIH) w~th rabbit polyclonal anti-E, histolytica serum by Torian and colleagues has resulted ~n the ~solation of a 700 base pair (bp) cDNA insert 3. However, this cDNA is ~ncomplete, lacking a portion of the 5' end of the copied messenger (m)RNA. The amino acid composition of the protein encoded by the cDNA contains 7% cys-te~ne, and monoclonal and polyclonar antibodies have been produced to this cysteine-rich protein by expressing it as a fusion protein with the carboxy terminus of glutathione S-transferase. Monoclonal antibodies were used to show that the 29kDa protein is expressed on the surface by indirect immunofluorescence.\n\nThis eDNA hybridizes on northern blots to an RNA molecule of 1050bp and to DNA extracts from four different axenic strains of E. hlstolytica although not to E. invadens, Acanthamoeba castellanii or Trichomonas vaginalis. The monoclonal antibodies also recognize the cysteine-rich protein in the axenic strains as well as six clinical isolates of pathogenic and nonpathogenic zymodemes of E. hls~olytica. Not all of the monoclonal antibodies recognize all of the clinical isolates, indicating that there are epitopes that are not conserved in all strains.\n\nThe unusual cysteine content of the protein may offer some clues to rcs function. At the 5' end of the cDNA there is the motif C2-X3-C-X4-C2-X2-C 3, where X is any amino acid. A similar sequence was found in inverse order ~n the peplomer protein E2 of porcine corona virus, which is involved in viral b~nding and entry into the cell, and in a wool keratin prote~n that is thought to impart structural rigidity. The monoclonal antibodies produced against the 29 kDa cysteine-rich antigen by Torian et al. ~3 should prove to be powerful tools to reach a further understanding of the antigen's structure and function.\n\nA 125 kDa protein band is recognized by the immune sera of 73% of patients with amebic I~ver abscess. Edman et al. used pooled human immune sera to isolate a cDNA clone encoding this antigen from the HM I: IMSS strain ~4. Sequence analysts of the cDNA reveals it to be identical to the partial sequence of the cEH-PI protein reported by Tannich et al. ~s Monospecific antibodpes, as well as a monoclonal antibody prepared from mice immunized with the 125 kDa band cut out of gels, have been used to demonstrate the cell surface location of the 125kDa antigen by indirect immunofluorescence.\n\nThe complete amino acid sequence was derived from a genomic clone that hybridizes with a mRNA of 3.0kb, whrch lacks introns and encodes a protein of 125 513 Da. This sequence is rich in tyrosine and asparagine residues, contains 17 potential N-linked glycosylation sites and has a 35amino acid amino-terminus hydrophobic region which is postulated to function as a signal/membrane anchor; there are no other hydrophobic domains in the protein. A 31 amino acid area has been found to have limited sequence identity with the i~ chain of mouse integrin, the i~ chain of the human fibronectin receptor and the band 3 precursor of chicken integrin, but the functional significance of the sequence identity is unclear.\n\nThe However, 61 amino acid substitutions (12.9%) have been seen when the sequence from the pathogen is compared to that of the nonpathogen'4.\n\nThe two 125 kDa antigen sequences from nonpathogenic strains are thus more simtlar to one another than to the sequences from the pathogenic strain HMI:IMSS. Tannich et a/. had earlier shown unique Southern blot patterns for the 125 kDa antigen in pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains for n~ne different E. histolytica strains ~s. They recently extended these studies to an additional 48 strains, and only one of the pathogenic strain had a nonpathogenic restriction pattern ~s~6. These analyses of the 125 kDa antigen gene support the concept that pathogenic and nonpathogenic E histolytica strains are genetically distinct.\n\nThe galactose lectin is an interesting molecule to study by virtue of its central role in adhesion and contact-dependent cytolysis. There is considerable evidence to support a critical role for a galactose lectin in pathogenesis. Ravdin and Guerrant have shown that adherence to, and killing of, CHO cells by E. histolytica are completely blocked by galactose or N-acetyI-D-galactosamine ~7 Phagocytosis of bacteria and erythrocytes, and binding to human colonic mucins can also be blocked by galactose~7.,8. Finally, CHO cell mutants lacking terminal N-acetyl lactosamine residues have been found to be resistant to amebic adherence and killing,9.20 Purified galactose lectin binds to CHO cells and compelitively inhibits amebic attachment to CHO cells in a galactose-sensitive manner 2~. Moreover, antiserum raised against the purified galactose lectin inhibits amebic adherence to CHO cells by 100% (Ref. 22 ) and blocks the bincing of human colonic mucin glycoproteins to amebic trophozoites ~ 8\n\nThe galactose ]ectin is a 260kDa heterodimer consisting of a 170kDa subunit and a 35 kDa subunit linked by disulfide bonds 22. Polyclonal antisera and monoclonal antibodies raised against the native or denatured lectin recognize only the 170 kDa subunit and it appears that the 35 kDa subunit is not immunogenic in humans mice, rabbits or gerbils 22. The light subunit has been shown to bind fibronectin on western blots (B.J. Mann and W.A. Petri, Jr, unpublished), and may be -.he fibronectin receptor identified by Talamas-Rohana and Heza 3. However, owing to the lack of specific antibody against the 35 kDa subunit, this has not yet been shown for intact trophozoites.\n\nMonoclonal antibodies specific for the 170kDa subunit block or enhance amebic adherence to CHO cells and colonic mucins, suggestir,g that the adherence domain resides within the heavy subunit 23. The ability of anti-lectin antibodies to dramatically increase the galactose-binding activity of the lectin indicates that its activity could be subject to conformational control. These same antibodies distinguish pathogenic from nonpathogenic strains of E. histolyt~ca. All six epitopes defined by the murine monoclonal antibodies were present on the 16pathogenic strai% tested but only two of these six epitopes were present on the nonpathogenic strains 24. The presence of the galactose lectin in nonpathogenic strains may reflect its requirement for amebic co onization of the large bowel, because of its function as the receptor for human colonic mucins.\n\nPrimates and humans are the only known reservoirs of E. histolytica. An \n\nanti-amebic vaccine that prevents large bowel colonization could theoretically eliminate F_. histolytica as a cause of human disease. The galactose lectin has several properties that make it an attractive subunit vaccine candidate: (I) as mentioned, the galactose lectin appears to play a critical role in amebic adherence to colonic mucosa, in the phagocytosis of bacteria and erythrocytes and in the initiation of contact-dependent cytolysis; (2) anti-lectin antibodies that prevent these functions could potentially protect the host from invasion and (3) the galactose lectin is a major amebic antigen recognized by 95% of all human immune sera tested 2s, and is antigenically conserved among geographically distinct isolates of E. histolytica 24\"26.\n\nThe ability of the galactose lectin to elicit a protective immune response has been tested in the gerbil model of amebic liver abscess. Gerbils received three immunizations with the affinitypurified lectin injected subcutaneously or intraperitoneally ~n Freund's adjuvant before direct intrahepatic challenge with 5 x 105 E. hlstolytica trophozoites. All of the immunized gerbils developed prechallenge anti-lectin antibody titers of 1:1024 or greater, and no ant,-lectin antibodies were detected in the und,luted sera from sham-immunized animals. The prechallenge immune sera completely blocked adherence at a I:10 dilution but increased adherence to 163% of control levels at a I:1000 dilution. Complete protection from liver abscess formation was seen in the majority of the lectin-immunized animals in three trials with subcutaneous immunization and one w,th intraperitoneal immunization. Combining the data from the four trials, 81% of control and 27% of immunized gerbils developed liver abscesses for an overall vaccine efficacy of 67% (Ref. 27) .\n\nThe molecular cloning and sequencing of the 170 kDa subunit of the galacrose lectin from pathogenic E. hlstolytica has recently been reported by our laboratory (B.J. Mann et al., abstract*) (Ref. 28) and Tannich et al. 29 A comparison of the amino acid sequences described by these two groups revealed that they are only 87.6% homologous (Fig. l a) , suggesting the presence of at least two genes encoding the \u2022 39th Annual Meeting of the American Sooety for Trop,cal Medicine and Hygiene (I 990) New Orleans, USA 170 kDa subunit. The presence of more than one gene encodtng the 170kDa subunit has been suggested by the observed microheterogeneity in the amino acid sequences obtained by sequential Edman degradation of the amino terminus and cyanogen bromide (CNBr) fragments :~, and by the complex restriction fragment patterns seen on Southern blots probed with the cDNA for the 170kDa subunit 79. The copy number of the genes encodtng the 170kDa subun;t and their genomic organization have yet to be determined. The sequences reported in Fig. I , which represent two differen~ genes encoding the 170kDa subunit of the galactose lectin, are proposed to be called hgll (Ref. 28 ) and hgl2 (Ref, 29) for heavy subunit galactose lectin, hgl2 is a cDNA clone isolated from the pathogenic strain HMI:IMSS. The DNA encoding the first 482amino acids of hgll was isolated from the HMI:IMSS genomic DNA w~th the remainder of the gene sequence determined from a cDNA clone of pathogenqc strain H-302:NIH. A combination of sequencing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments has revealed that hgll does not contain any introns 28.\n\nThe calculated relative molecular masses of hgll and hgl2 are 143 241 Da and 143 780 Do, respectively, and their individual amino acid composition and overall structure are also very similar. The nonuniform distribution of hydrophobic amino acids of hgll and hgl2 suggests the existence of five structural domains (Fig. I b, I c) : (I) At the amino terminus of the mature protein is a 187amino acid cysteine (3.2mol %)and tryptoDhan (2.1 mole %)-rich amino-terminus domain; (2) The second cysteine-free domain, corresponding to hgll residues 188-378, contains alternoting hydrophobic and hydrophilic stretches of amino acids and ~s the most variable between the two proteins. A substantial nonconservative change is the addition of eight amino acids at amino acid285 in hgll; (3) The third structural domain is the cysteine-rich domain, which contains 10.8 mol % of cysteine. The number and position of the cyste~ne residues have been conserved with the exception of amino acidS04, which is a serine residue in hgl2. It has been shown that the cysteine residues play an important role in the observed protease resistance of the 170 kDa subunit and may be important for parasite survival in the gut28; (4) A putative transmembrane domain contains only two conservative changes between hgll and hgl2 and (5) The carboxy-terminal domain is a putative cytoplasmic tail that is also highly conserved. There are a total of II threonine, serine and tyrosine residues that are potential sites for phosphorylation in the cytoplasmic domain of hgl2 and only nine such residues in hgll. Tyrosine residue 1261, present in both hgll and hgl2, ~s surrounded by an amino acid sequence that shares ~dentity with the autophosphorylat~on site of the epidermal growth factor receptor 28. It is interesting to speculate that phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain may be a mechanqsm of activation of the lectin, and that the degree of phosphorylation could functionally distinguish the different forms of the 1 70 kDa subunit. The h~gh degree of conservation of the cytoplasmic domain also suggests that the lectin may interact with a cytoplasmic protein in another route of signal transduction.\n\nThe 170 kDa subunit has been shown to be glycosylated and the treatment of amebae with tunicamycin results in almost a complete loss of adherence to CHO cells, showing that there is a critical role for N-linked glycosylation in amebic adherence. Sixteen potential glycosylation sites have been found in hgll (Fig. Ic) and hgl2 has only nine sites, although all of these sites are conserved in hgll. The drfference in the number of potentiai glycosylation s~tes could also indicate that the different members of the lectin gene family are functionally distinct.\n\nThe carbohydrate-binding portion of the molecule has not yet been identified and the 170kDa sequence does not share any significant amino acid identities with the conserved regions of the carbohydrate-binding domain of C-or S-type lectins, the E. coli o~-1,4-galactose-binding pilus or plant lectins that have been sequenced thus far 28. Although the evidence suggests that the carbohydrate-binding activity resides in the 170 kDa subunit, it is possible that it is contained within the 35 kDa subunit or ~s formed by the heterodimer of the two subunits.\n\nThe recent discovery of two different genes encoding the 170 kDa subunit of the galactose lectin opens up new avenues of investigations. The number of family members, physical association of the gene copies, functional differences and possible transcriptional differences can be examined A comparison of the similarities and differences between different members of the gene family should provide valu-able information regarding the adherence, cytolytic and cell-signaling functions of the lectin. The contributions of the light subuntt to the functional activities of the galactose lectin remain unresolved as do the biological functions of many of the other surface antigens identtfied to date. Continued characterization of the galactose lectin and other surface proteins should provide greater understanding of the immunology, pathogenicity and molecular biology of this globally important parasite."}
