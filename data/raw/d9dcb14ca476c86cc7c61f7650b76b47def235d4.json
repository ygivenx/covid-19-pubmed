{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Clinical characteristics of COVID-19-infected cancer patients: A retrospective case study in three hospitals within Wuhan, China #Contributed equally *Author for correspondence", "body": "We retrospectively studied clinical features of 28 severe COVID-19-infected cancer patients from 3 hospitals in Wuhan, China.\n\nWe analyzed risk factors associated with occurrence of admission to an ICU, usage of mechanical ventilation or death.\n\nCOVID-19-infected cancer patients presented poor outcomes with high occurrence of clinical severe event and mortality.\n\nAnti-tumour treatment within 14 days of COVID-19 diagnosis increased the risk of developing severe events.\n\nIn December 2019, a cluster of pneumonias of unknown pathogen was first announced in Wuhan, a city within the central part of China 1, 2 . Earlier cases were linked to a large seafood and live animal market for selling different wild animal species 3 . The causative agent of the pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus and named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 2 . Genetic analysis of the full-length genome sequences revealed SARS-CoV-2 to be most closely related to a known bat coronavirus termed BatCoV RaTG13, indicating bats as the likely origin 3 . This suggested the high possibility of animal-to-human transmission. Afterwards, human-to-human transmission was confirmed by a cluster of 15 health-care workers, who were all infected by one patient with the novel coronavirus infection 4 Prior to December 2019, 6 coronaviruses strains were known to infect humans, including two highly pathogenic strains, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and four other strains causing respiratory illnesses ranging from a self-resolving cold to severe pneumonia 5 anti-tumour treatments as usual in epidemic areas. Therefore, we aimed to explore these issues by conducting an urgent retrospective case study on critical COVID-19-infected cancer patients. \n\nThe 28 Figure 1 demonstrates typical CT findings of two patients.\n\nTreatment of patients are shown in Table 2 \n\nThe association of clinical factors with severe events is summarized in Supplementary (Figure 2a and 2b ).\n\nThe clinical characteristics of 28 cancer patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from three We also found that the CT feature of patchy consolidation on admission is a risk factor associated with severe events. Ground-glass opacity and patchy consolidation were both common CT findings in COVID-19-infected cancer patients, similar to the features in the general population 13 .\n\nShi H et al 13 analyzed the timing of emergence and persistence of those features on CT. They found that ground-glass opacity appeared first, even before symptom onset, then increased during the following two weeks, and decreasing gradually in the third week. Patchy consolidation usually appeared in first to second weeks after symptom onset. It can rapidly evolve into bilateral extensive consolidation, with a white lung appearance on CT, leading to poor prognosis. Therefore, CT on admission showing patchy consolidation may imply that admission time of these cases would be at least 1 to 2 weeks after the onset of illness. The delayed admission time for cancer patients may be a reasonable explanation for the poor outcome of some cases in our cohort.\n\nIn our cohort, 71.4% of the patients were prescribed at least one antiviral agent. About one-third of patients received more than one antiviral agent. However, currently there is no drug that has proven to be effective against SARS-CoV-2. Systemic steroids remain controversial in the treatment of viral pneumonia. Usage of steroids has been considered to slow virus clearance due to its immunosuppressive effect, which was often associated with an increased risk of opportunistic infections, especially in patients who required mechanical ventilation. In our observations, even though more than half of patients received steroids treatment, we couldn't demonstrate reduced incidence of severe events in our cancer patient cohort.\n\nIt was also noted that 28.6% of our patients had developed COVID-19 infection during hospitalization and nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was suspected. Hospital-related transmission has been reported in both patients and healthcare workers. In a retrospective case study with 138 patients, 41.3% of the patients were reported to have acquired COVID-19 infection during hospitalization, and out these, 5 patients were from the oncology department 11 . Nationwide Our findings support the vulnerability of cancer patients in current pandemic. However, our findings are also based on some study limitations. First, the study was retrospective, nonrandomized and was based on a small sample size. "}
