{"title": "THE ROLE OF INTERFERON IN SPONTANEOUS CELL-MEDIATED CYTOTOXICITY IN PIGS", "body": "In an earlier paper (Cepica and Derbyshire, 1983) we described spontaneous cell-mediated cytotoxicity (SCMC) against target cells infected with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a porcine enteric coronavirus, mediated by porcine peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL). SCMC by porcine iymphocytes against human myeloid leukemia (K562) cells (Kim et al., 1980; Norley and Wardley, 1983) , against IB.RS.2 cells and GBK cells infected with pseudorabies virus has also been described. We have shown that PBL and IEL from neonatal piglets are incapable of acting as effector cells in SCMC against TGEV-infected targets (Cepica and Derbyshire, 1984a) , as are neonatal PBL against K562 cells (Kim et al., 1980) . The adoptive transfer of PBL from an adult pig to inbred neonatal recipients established SCMC effector activity in the PBL and IEL of the latter (Cepica and Derbyshire, 1984b) , and challenge of the recipient piglets with TGEV indicated that the adoptive transfer of PBL increased their resistance to infection, suggesting that SCMC may be an important defence mechanism against this enteric virus. This finding raised the possibility of activating SCMC effector activity in the newborn, thereby increasing resistance to neonatal viral infection.\n\nAugmentation of SCMC effector activity by interferon (IFN) is well established in the mouse (Gidlund et al., 1978; Djeu et al., 1979) and in man (Trinchieri et al., 1978) . In the pig it has been shown that SCMC against K562 cells can be enhanced by incubation of effector lymphocytes from young adults with either porcine or human IFN (Charley et al., 1983) . Lysis of IB.RS.2 cells, both uninfected and infected with pseudorabies virus, by PBL, was also enhanced by human IFN (Martin and Wardley, 1984} , but studies on the role of IFN in SCMC by porcine lymphocytes against TGEV-infected targets, and of the effects of IFN on SCMC effector lymphocytes from neonatal piglets axe lacking.\n\nThe objective of the present study was to investigate the role of IFN in SCMC against TGEV-infected target cells. The kinetics of cytotoxicity and IFN production in the SCMC chromium (~lCr) release assay are described, and the effects of pretreatment with porcine IFN of the effector and target cells in both the SCMC SlCr release assay and in a single cell cytotoxicity assay for SCMC axe reported. The latter assay was also used to determine the ability of SCMC incompetent PBL from neonatal pigs to bind to target cells, and to acquire cytotoxic activity after treatment with IFN.\n\nThe target cells (Cepica and Derbyshire, 1983) were PK-15 cells or PK-15 cells persistently infected with TGEV (PK-15-TGE ceils). The effector cells were PBL from young adult pigs lacking TGEV neutralizing antibodies, isolated and purified by centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque, with removal of monocytes by plastic adherence, as described by Cepica and Derbyshire (1984a) . The assays were performed as described previously (Cepica and Derbyshire, 1983) , with an effector:target cell ratio of 50:1 and incubation for 16 h. Appropriate controls were included as before, and all determinations were made in triplicate except for the controls for spontaneous and total S~Cr release, for which six wells were used. The results are expressed as % specific S~Cr release, computed as 100 \u00d7 [(mean sample release-mean spontaneous release)/(mean total release-mean spontaneous release)]. Each release was measured in counts per minute.\n\nPK-15 and PK-15-TGE cells were grown to confluency in Falcon 25 cm 2 tissue culture flasks. The media were discarded, the monolayers rinsed twice with phosphate buffered saline, and 10 ml of complete RPMI-1640 medium (Cepica and Derbyshire, 1983) containing 2.6 X l0 T PBL isolated from young adults or neonatal pigs were added to each flask. Controls comprised PK-15 and PK-15-TGE cells without PBL, and PBL without target cells. The cultures were incubated for 16 h at 37\u00b0C, after which the media were collected and centrifuged at 200 X g for 15 min. The supernatants were sterilized by ultraviolet irradiation by exposure in a 1.0 mm layer to a General Electric G15T8 15 Watt ultraviolet lamp at a distance of 15 cm for 15 min and stored at -70\u00b0C prior to assay for IFN activity.\n\nSupernatants from SCMC S~Cr release assays and supernatants from co-cultivated target and effector cells were assayed for antiviral activity against vesicular stomatitis virus. Monolayers of stable swine testis (SST) cells (McClurkin and Norman, 1966} were tested with dilutions of the appropriate supernatants for 20 h and then challenged with approximately 20 plaque-forming units of vesicular stomatitis virus. Antiviral units of IFN activity are expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of supernatant that inhibited the formation of i>50% of the plaques.\n\nThe test was based on that described by Grimm and Bonavida (1979) . Briefly, trypsinized PK-15 or PK-15-TGE cells (2.5 \u00d7 10 ~) were mixed with equal numbers of adult or neonatal PBL. The mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 100 X g, and the pelleted cells incubated for 5 min at 37\u00b0C to allow binding of lymphocytes to target cells. The cells were resuspended, 2.0 ml of 1% agarose were added, and 1.0 ml was spread in a Falcon tissue culture dish. Additional layers of 2.0 ml of 1% agarose, and 1.0 ml of complete RPMI-1640 were added. After incubation for 16 h at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO: the fluid medium was removed, 0.1% trypan blue was added and incubation continued for 15 min. The stain was then replaced with 0.5% formaldehyde. The number of target-binding lymphocytes was determined by scoring a minimum of 500 lymphocytes in the cell mixture before the addition of agarose. After incubation under agarose and staining, 500 lymphocyte-target cell conjugates were observed, and the proportion of conjugates with non-viable (stained) target cells was determined. Target cell viability under these cultural conditions was checked in control dishes from which PBL were omitted.\n\nFresh PBL from a young adult pig and both PK-15-TGE and PK-15 target cells were used in the S~Cr release assay. Supernatants were harvested at intervals of 0, 4, 8, 12 and 16 h and tested for S~Cr release and IFN (antiviral) activity (Fig. 1) . Neither significant specific S~Cr release nor IFN activity were detected at 4 h, and little activity was demonstrated at 8 h. Both activities increased in parallel between 8 and 16 h. Higher levels of both specific S~Cr release and IFN were obtained in the cultures containing PK-15-TGE target cells than in those containing uninfected PK-15 cells. \n\nPBL from young adults and newborn piglets were compared with respect to IFN production in mixed cultures of effector cells and PK-15 and PK-15-TGE target cells. Three replicates of each test were performed, and the results are shown in Table I . It was confirmed that co-cultivation of PBL from the adult donors with PK-15-TGE cells resulted in the appearance of IFN activity in the media. Co-cultivation of adult PBL with the uninfected PK-15 cells also produced IFN, but the yields were significantly (P < 0.05} lower by the t-test than when PK-15-TGE cells were used. The mixed cultures of target cells with PBL from newborn piglets yielded comparable levels of IFN to the cultures containing adult PBL. IFN was not detected in the control cultures. One sample of medium from the co-cultivation of PK-15-TGE cells with adult PBL, containing 320 units ml ~ of antiviral IFN activity, was used as a source of porcine IFN in the experiments described below. \n\nPBL from a young adult pig were incubated with IFN (2 x 10 ~ ceils and 320 antiviral units ml-' IFN) or with a mock IFN control preparation obtained from lymphocytes cultured in the absence of target cells, for 18 h at 37\u00b0C and washed twice. The lymphocytes were then used in the SCMC S'Cr release assay against both PK-15 and PK-15-TGE target cells. In addition, mock IFN-treated PBL were tested against PK-15-TGE cells with 320 units ml ~ IFN added directly to the reaction. As shown in Fig. 2 , pretreatment of the effector PBL with IFN augmented their SCMC effector activity for both PK-15 and PK-15-TGE targets. However, the addition of IFN to the mixture of PK-15-TGE ceils and PBL at the start of the reaction did not increase specific SCMC S'Cr release.\n\nIn the next experiment, PK-15 and PK-15-TGE target cells were pretreated with IFN or with a mock IFN preparation as above, and adult PBL pretreated with IFN were used as effector cells in the SCMC SICr release assay. Pretreatment of the PK-15-TGE cells with IFN had no effect on the SCMC reaction (Fig. 3) , while IFN pretreatment of the PK-15 targets reduced their release of s ~Cr in the SCMC reaction.

This was conducted with PBL isolated from neonatal piglets, as well as from adults, as effector cells, and with PK-15 and PK-15-TGE target cells. Both IFN pretreated (as above) and untreated target and effector cells were used. Four replicates of the experiment were done, with PBL from different animals. The results are shown in Table II . PBL from newborn piglets bound to either target cell with the same frequency as PBL from SCMC competent adult pigs, and IFN treatment of either effector or target cells had no effect on target-binding frequency. The stimulatory effect of pretreatment with IFN on the SCMC effect/Jr activity of adult PBL for both PK-15-TGE and PK-15 (:ells was confirmed, since the mean percentages of lysed targets were significantly greater (P < 0.05) by the t-test when IFN pretreated PBL were used. Untreated PBL from newborn piglets failed to mediate SCMC against either target cell, but they were rendered cytotoxic by pretreatment with IFN. IFN pretreatment of PK-15-TGE did not influence their susceptibility to SCMC, while, as in the S~Cr release assay, IFN pretreatment of the uninfected PK-15 cells resulted in significant (P < 0.05) protection against SCMC. \n\nThe results show that the increase of specific S'Cr release during the SCMC reaction was paralleled by the production of IFN, and that IFN was produced by the co-cultivation of monolayers of the target PK-15 or PK-15-TGE cells with the PBL effector cells. More IFN resulted from the mixed cultures containing TGEV-infected target cells than from those containing uninfected PK-15 cells. Similar results were obtained by Trinchieri et al. (1977 Trinchieri et al. ( , 1978 and by Santoli et al. (1978) with human lyre-phocytes and various virus-infected cells. The finding that PBL from newborn piglets, which we have shown previously to be unable to mediate SCMC (Cepica and Derbyshire, 1984a) , bind to target cells with the same relative frequency as those from older SCMC-competent pigs, and respond by IFN production in mixed cultures, suggests that the lack of SCMC effector activity in newborn piglets is not associated with a lack of effector cells or their inability to produce IFN, but possibly with a lack of the stimulation needed for autologous IFN production in vivo.\n\nPretreatment of PBL with IFN was shown to augment their SCMC effector activity. This was observed for adult pigs in both the S'Cr release assay and the single cell cytotoxicity assay. The promotional effect of IFN on SCMC effector activity is well established (Gidlund et al., 1978; Trinchieri et al., 1978; Djeu et al., 1979; Charley et al., 1983; Martin and Wardley, 1984) , although in the porcine system, neither the type of effector cells nor the type of IFN involved have been determined, in contrast to human and murine systems (Rager-Zisman and Bloom, 1985) . Of greater significance was our finding that lymphocytes from newborn piglets, normally inactive as SCMC effectors, could also be stimulated by IFN, though to a lesser degree than lymphocytes from SCMC competent older pigs. This observation suggests that it might be possible to stimulate SCMC incompetent lymphocytes in neonates in vivo by the treatment of piglets with IFN or IFN inducers.\n\nThe effects of IFN on the target cells in the SCMC reaction was also of interest. This was shown to be selective, in that the TGEV-infec~d PK-15 cells were not affected in their susceptibility to SCMC by pretreatment with IFN, whereas the uninfected PK-15 cells were protected against SCMC by IFN pretreatment. It is apparent that the effects of IFN were not mediated at the level of effector-target recognition, since the percentage of target-binding lymphocytes was similar, irrespective of IFN pretreatment of either target or effector cells. It could be speculated that if IFN acts in a similar manner in vivo on target and effector cells, it could be a powerful tool in the regulation of SCMC, by stimulating SCMC against virus-infected cells and protecting uninfected cells against SCMC."}
