{"title": "Liver Sinusoidal Endothelial Cell Lectin, LSECtin, Negatively Regulates Hepatic T-Cell Immune Response", "body": "A ccumulating evidence indicates that the liver is an important immune organ that favors the induction of tolerance rather than immunity, 1-3 which is critical for maintaining immunologic silence in response to harmless antigenic material present in food. The immune tolerance of the liver also might account for the survival of liver allografts and diverse hepatic inflammatory diseases, 2 which highlights the importance of understanding the nature of hepatic immune regulation. Two crucial mechanisms have been proposed for liver tolerance. First, the liver is unlike any other organ in the T-cell biology, as best illustrated by inactivation, tolerance, and apoptosis. 4 Second, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and Kupffer cells play significant roles in the distinctive constraints on hepatic T cells. [5] [6] [7] [8] The exact molecular mechanisms underlying the hepatic T-cell immune regulation, however, have not been elucidated.\n\nT-cell immune regulation is regulated precisely through a variety of mechanisms, and cell-surface regulators such as co-signaling molecules have been identified as crucial components. Even so, the understanding of cell-surface regulators for T-cell immunity has been greatly expanded by the introduction of the lectin superfamily. 9 For example, the C-type lectin macrophage galactose-type C-type lectin (MGL) on dendritic cells (DCs) negatively regulates effector T cells via interaction with CD45. 10 A genomewide association study identified the predicted C-type lectin KIAA0350 as a type 1 diabetes gene, suggesting its regulatory role in the activation of cytotoxic T cells. 11 It is clear that lectins are crucial players in immune tolerance and homeostasis, and are involved in diseases of the immune system. It is noteworthy that several lectins also are localized to the liver, although no lectins have been confirmed to be T-cell regulators in the liver thus far.\n\nWe identified LSECtin from the liver, which belongs to the C-type lectin subfamily including CD23, dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), and liver/lymph node-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin (L-SIGN). 12 Accumulating evidence suggests that this family is vital in the regulation of immune effector cells: DC-SIGN is essential for DC-induced T-cell prolif-eration 13 ; L-SIGN has a similar function; and CD23 is involved in the up-regulation or down-regulation of immunoglobulin (Ig)E via interaction with CD21 on B cells or IgE, respectively. 14 It was reported that LSECtin functions as an attachment factor for Ebola virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 15 Until now, the function of LSECtin in immune regulation has remained unclear. The specific localization of LSECtin in the LSECs and Kupffer cells 12, 16 inspired us to investigate whether LSECtin interacts with immune cells and contributes to hepatic immune regulation.\n\nIn the present study, we found that LSECtin specifically recognizes activated T cells and negatively regulates T-cell receptor-mediated signaling and the T-cell immune response in vitro, characterized by decreased proliferation and activation, as well as down-regulation of T-cell cytokines. We generated LSECtin knockout (KO) mice and observed an increased accumulation of T cells in liver in the absence of LSECtin. In mice with T-cellmediated acute liver injury, the lack of LSECtin accelerated the disease owing to an increased T-cell immune response, whereas the exogenous administration of recombinant LSECtin protein or plasmid ameliorated the disease by down-regulating T-cell immunity. Thus, our results reveal a crucial mechanism by which hepatic T-cell immunity is controlled by the C-type lectin LSECtin.\n\nThe cell lines HL-60, U937, Daudi, Molt-4, CEM, Jurkat, CHO, and MCF7 were from American Type Culture Collection. Human LSECs were from Sciencell Research Laboratories (Carlsbad, CA). CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 subsets or total T cells were purified using the MACS beads system (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Mouse LSECs were prepared as reported previously. 8\n\nThe monoclonal antibody (mAb) against CD3 (h: HIT3a; m: 500A2), anti-CD4 (RPA-T4), anti-CD8 (RPA-T8), anti-CD69 (FN50), and anti-CD25 (M-A251) were from BD Pharmingen (San Jose, CA). The mAb against CD28 (ANC28.1/5D10) was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Antimouse interleukin (IL)-2 (JES6-5H4), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u2423 (MP6-XT22), and interferon (IFN)-\u2425 (AN18.17.24) were from MACS. Anti-mouse CD3 (145-2C11), anti-mouse CD4 (L3T4), anti-mouse CD8 (Ly-2), anti-mouse CD44 (IM7), anti-DO11.10 T-cell receptor (TCR) (KJ1-26), and the mAb against CD28 (37.51) were from eBioscience (San Diego, CA). Anti-mouse CD62L (MEL-14) was from BioLegend (San Diego, CA). All phospho-specific antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). hLSECtin-Fc protein was prepared as described. 12 The complementary DNA (cDNA) coding full-length and soluble mLSECtin were subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1a (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).\n\nCells were incubated with LSECtin-Fc, mAb against LSECtin, and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, and analyzed on a FACScalibur (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Activated peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBLs) labeled with PKH26 were incubated with the cells stably expressing pIRES2-EGFP LSECtin with or without blocking antibodies against LSECtin. Adherent cells were lysed and fluorescence was quantified on a fluostar spectrofluorometer (BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany).\n\nPBLs were seeded onto CHO or CHO-LSECtin cells and then were stimulated with soluble anti-CD3 or were seeded onto plates coated with LSECtin-Fc and anti-CD3 mAb, followed by 72 hours of culture. In some cases anti-CD28 was added to the cells. DO11.10 CD4 \u03e9 T cells were cultured in 96-well plates with spleen cells (3 \u03eb 10 5 , irradiated with 2500 rads), along with the ovalbumin (OVA) (323-339) peptide and precoated LSECtin-Fc, or plated directly onto LSECs in the presence of OVA peptide. Cell proliferation was estimated by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine. Supernatants were collected and the cytokines were determined by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits.\n\nA genomic mouse LSECtin clone was isolated from a 129/SvJ library and was used to construct a targeting vector that was electroporated into 129 R1 embryonic stem cells. Targeted clones that had undergone homologous recombination were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and verified by Southern blot analysis, and these were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts to generate chimeric mice. To remove the neo-loxP cassette carrying the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter-driven neo gene flanked by lox sequences, agouti F1 heterozygous progeny were crossed with E2a-Cre transgenic mice, and the resultant mice were back-crossed to C57BL/6 strains for 6 generations. Germ line transmission was confirmed by PCR of tail DNA.\n\nMale Balb/C mice were injected with an optimum dose (18 mg/kg) of Con A (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) via the tail vein. A reduced dose (8 mg/kg) of Con A was used in KO mice. The small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or the mLSECtin cDNA plasmid were delivered in vivo as described. 17, 18 Mice were administered LSECtin-Fc or control-Fc via tail vein. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were estimated using a detection kit.\n\nA Student t test and 1-way analysis of variance with the Tukey post hoc test were used for statistical analysis. Results with a P value of less than .05 were considered as statistically significant.\n\nCharacterization of LSECtin family members such as DC-SIGN suggest that LSECtin might act as a cell adhesion molecule in the immune system. To test this hypothesis we screened a series of cell lines to identify the LSECtin ligand by flow cytometry. We found that LSECtin-Fc interacted with the CEM and Jurkat T cell lines ( Figure 1A ). Moreover, when tested after stimulation with phorbol-12myristate-13-acetate (PMA) combination with ionomycin, Jurkat T cells showed markedly increased binding of LSECtin, and this binding required the presence of Ca 2\u03e9 because it was inhibited by addition of the calcium chelator ethylene glycol-bis(b-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N=,N=-tetraace-tic acid (EGTA) ( Figure 1B ). We then sought to determine whether LSECtin receptor is expressed naturally on T cells in vivo. By using flow cytometry analysis, we found that LSECtin-Fc specifically bound peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) activated by PMA and ionomycin, and this interaction could be inhibited completely by the addition of EGTA ( Figure 1C ). However, LSECtin did not bind nonactivated PBMCs. To verify T-cell binding, we purified either CD4 \u03e9 or CD8 \u03e9 cells from PBMCs by positive selection using antibody-coated magnetic beads. LSECtin showed strong binding to activated CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 T cells ( Figure 1D ). To confirm the interaction of LSECtin and T cells at a cellular level, cell-cell adhesion experiments were performed to assess the adhesion of peripheral blood T cells to LSECtin transfectants. Activated peripheral blood T cells specifically adhered to MCF7 cells expressing LSECtin compared with background binding to parental MCF7 cells. This binding was inhibited by a blocking antibody to LSECtin ( Figure 1E and F), confirming the specificity of the interaction.\n\nLSECtin has a typical carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and binds mannose, GlcNAc, and fucose in a Ca 2\u03e9dependent manner. 12 Therefore, we sought to determine whether LSECtin binds to activated T cells through a pro- tein-glycan interaction, The binding of LSECtin to activated T cells actually was prevented by EGTA and saccharides such as D-mannose, N-GlcNAc, and L-fucose ( Figure  2A ). To assess the contribution of N-or O-linked glycosylation in LSECtin adhesion, activated T cells were cultured in the presence of tunicamycin or benzyl-\u2423-GalNAc, which could block the formation of proteins N-or Oglycosidic linkages, respectively. Tunicamycin abrogated the adhesion of T cells to LSECtin, whereas benzyl-\u2423-GalNAc did not ( Figure 2B ). Amino acid sequence alignment of the CRD of LSECtin with that of other C-type lectins indicates that 4 amino acids, Glu254, Asn256, Asn 274, and Asp275, interact with Ca 2\u03e9 through their carbonyl groups, and Glu254/Asn256 exist in a conserved EPN motif, which is important for carbohydrate recognition. 12, 19 Thus, we generated a series of LSECtin point mutants, including N256D, N274D, and D275A, in the soluble isoform. Alteration of each residue completely abolished the binding of LSECtin-Fc to T cells ( Figure  2C ), compared with the control substitution L231A. These results indicate that LSECtin binds to activated T cells through a protein-glycan interaction.\n\nConsidering that LSECtin recognizes activated T cells, we investigated whether LSECtin regulates T-cell immune response. We cultured peripheral blood T cells with anti-CD3 mAb and LSECtin-Fc for 72 hours and found that the up-regulation of cell surface activation molecules, including CD69 and CD25, was inhibited by LSECtin ( Figure 3A ). Proliferation was estimated by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine, and it was found that LSECtin significantly decreased T-cell proliferation stimulated by anti-CD3 ( Figure 3B ). To examine the effects of soluble LSECtin ligation on the production of cytokines, culture supernatants from T-cell proliferation assays, as shown previously, were harvested at 48 hours. Secretion of IFN-\u2425, IL-2, and IL-10 was inhibited signif-icantly by LSECtin-Fc, although the production of transforming growth factor-\u2424 was not affected ( Figure 3C ). To further test whether LSECtin on the cell surface inhibits T-cell responses, we established a stably expressing CHO cell line of LSECtin (CHO-LSECtin). PBMCs were cocultured with irradiated CHO-LSECtin cells or mock CHO cells and soluble anti-CD3 mAb for 48 hours. Membrane-bound LSECtin decreased the secretion of IFN-\u2425 and IL-2 in the culture supernatants of PBMCs; on the other hand, its siRNA reversed this effect ( Figure 3D ). The negative effect of LSECtin also was observed in the presence of anti-CD28 mAb ( Figure 3E ), suggesting that the suppression cannot be overcome by co-stimulation. To study antigen-specific signals, we examined the effects of LSECtin on T cells that were expressing an OVAspecific TCR transgene. The secretion of IFN-\u2425 and IL-2 was shown to be inhibited significantly by LSECtin-Fc ( Figure 3F ).\n\nTo illustrate the mechanism of LSECtin-mediated T-cell inhibition, we first examined tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins after stimulation via the TCR for 60 minutes. We examined TCR-mediated phosphorylation of ZAP-70, LCK, and PKC tyrosine kinase and found that the phosphorylation of these proteins was decreased ( Figure  4A ). ERK and JNK are 2 important downstream targets of TCR activation in response to TCR signals. The phosphorylation of ERK and JNK was up-regulated in activated T cells, whereas it was down-regulated by LSECtin engagement ( Figure 4A ). We also examined the TCR-mediated nuclear factor-B (NF-B) pathway. The phosphorylation of IB was decreased, which is important for its proteasomal degradation and for the activation of NF-B. Moreover, the expression of NF-B target genes IL-2R, TNF-\u2423, and IRF1 obviously was decreased using quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) assay ( Figure 4A and B) .\n\nTo determine the in vivo function of LSECtin, we generated LSECtin-deficient mice. Our gene targeting vec- Figure 5B ). Chimeric male mice were derived from these ES clones by standard procedures. They were crossed to C57BL/6 females, and heterozygous mutant mice were established from targeted ES clone G8. Heterozygous and homozygous LSECtin mutant mice then were identified by PCR analysis of genomic DNA isolated from tail biopsies ( Figure 5C ). To confirm the absence of LSECtin in these mice, the expression of LSECtin in the liver was estimated by reverse-transcription PCR analysis.\n\nAs expected, LSECtin was detected in wild-type (wt) but not in KO liver ( Figure 5D ). The loss of LSECtin protein in liver also was confirmed by immunofluorescein staining ( Figure 5E ). These mice initially were back-crossed to the C57BL/6 background for at least 6 generations before they were used in the studies described.\n\nOur previous work showed that LSECtin messenger RNA is expressed in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. 12 Recent studies have indicated that LSECtin also is present in Kupffer cells, 16 which was confirmed in our study ( Supplementary Figures 1 and 2) . LSECtin limited LSECtin KO mice displayed normal numbers and ratios of CD4 \u03e9 CD8 \u03e9 , CD4 \u03e9 , and CD8 \u03e9 T cells in the thymus. The T-cell populations in the spleen and lymph nodes also appeared to show normal numbers ( Figure  6A ). In contrast, an increase in CD4 \u03e9 (42% in KO mice vs 37% in wt mice) and CD8 \u03e9 (23% in KO mice vs 18% in wt mice) T cells were found in the liver, but no effect was detected in the lung and kidney. To determine the phenotype of accumulated T cells in the liver of LSECtin KO mice, we examined the expression of CD62L and CD44 \n\nLSECtin KO mice were CD62L lo CD44 Hi in comparison with normal mice (60% vs 45%), although no difference was found in the spleen of the same mice ( Figure 6A ), suggesting that a large number of these T cells were activated. These results implicated that LSECtin could play a key role in the regulation of hepatic T-cell immunity.\n\nGiven that the amount of LSECtin present in the in vitro models could well have been nonphysiologic, we performed analyses using co-culture TCR transgenic T cells with KO or wt LSECs. The T cells co-cultured with KO LSECs showed higher responses than those cultured with wt LSECs, indicating that LSECtin on LSECs downregulates T-cell immune responses ( Figure 6B ). The role of LSECtin in the regulation of T cells in liver was evaluated further in a DO11.10 TCR transgenic T-cell transfer system in which wt DO11.10 CD4 \u03e9 T cells were transferred into either wt or LSECtin KO mice. The mice subsequently were challenged with OVA peptide. We observed a significant increase in DO11.10 CD4 \u03e9 T cells in the liver of KO mice compared with wt mice on day 4 post-OVA peptide injection ( Figure 6C) .\n\nWe also induced experimental acute hepatitis in mice using Con A, which is an activated T-cell-mediated liver disease model. 20 We then analyzed the effect of LSECtin on activated T-cell-mediated acute liver injury induced via Con A using LSECtin KO mice. Inflammatory liver injury was exacerbated with increased serum ALT/AST, and more serious liver histologic damage was observed in (8 -12 wk) , and subsequently analyzed by CD4 and CD8 expression using specific mAbs. The numbers represent the percentage of CD4 \u03e9 , CD8 \u03e9 , and CD4 \u03e9 CD8 \u03e9 subsets. Lymphocytes isolated from the spleen or liver of the same mice were stained with anti-CD62L-phycoerythrin and anti-CD44 -fluorescein isothiocyanate and subjected to flow cytometry analysis. (B) DO11.10 CD4 \u03e9 T cells were activated with 1 g/mL of OVA peptide presented by LSECs from wt or KO mice for 48 hours. Supernatants were collected and cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. (C) Naive DO11.10 T cells were transferred into wt or KO mice via intravenous infusion on day 0. OVA peptide was injected intraperitoneally daily for 3 days from day 1. On day 4 after the first OVA peptide injection, lymphocytes from the liver and spleen were isolated and stained with anti-CD4 and DO11.10. The results represent the average percentage of CD4 \u03e9 /DO11.10. T cells from 2-3 mice at each time point from 3 experiments. (D) Acceleration of acute liver inflammatory injury in LSECtin KO mice. Wt or KO mice were administered Con A. After 24 hours, plasma ALT/AST levels were measured, and liver samples were collected for H&E staining. (E) Liver infiltrating mononuclear cells were collected and lymphocyte populations were analyzed using anti-CD3, anti-CD4, and anti-CD8 antibodies. (F) Total cell numbers of TNF-\u2423-and IFN-\u2425-producing T cells were counted by intracellular cytokine staining. \u0afd P \u03fd .05; n \u03ed 5.\n\nthe LSECtin KO compared with the wt mice ( Figure 6D ). The total number of lymphocytes in the liver was significantly higher in LSECtin KO mice than in wt mice ( Figure 6E) . Moreover, the hepatic T cells of LSECtin KO mice were found to show higher levels of TNF-\u2423 and IFN-\u2425 compared with wt mice ( Figure 6F ). We also investigated the in vivo silencing effect of siRNA duplexes targeting the LSECtin gene by delivering synthetic siRNA duplexes into the mouse liver by hydrodynamic tail vein injection. In concordance with data from the LSECtin KO mice, the siRNA knock-down mice showed higher levels of plasma ALT and AST, serious liver histologic damage, and higher activity of hepatic T cells compared with wt mice (Supplementary Figure 3) . Combining the results from in vitro and in vivo studies, it is reasonable to conclude that LSECtin is involved in constraining T-cell immunity in the liver.\n\nTo show the therapeutic effect of LSECtin on Con A-induced hepatitis, 2 approaches were used. We first tried a protein therapeutic approach in which we directly administered recombinant soluble LSECtin before Con A via the tail. It was found that LSECtin protein significantly reduced disease severity, as illustrated by H&E and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling staining, and remarkably decreased serum ALT/AST levels ( Figure 7A and B) . However, when given after Con A, LSECtin could not reverse established inflammation (Supplementary Figure 4) . To confirm whether the protective effect was caused by suppression of T-cell activity, we determined the infiltrating lymphocyte subpopulations in the liver. A significant decrease in T-cell infiltration was detected in the livers of LSECtin-Fc-treated mice ( Figure 7C ). Moreover, LSECtin-Fc treatment decreased the numbers of TNF-\u2423and IFN-\u2425producing T cells in liver ( Figure 7D) . A soluble LSECtin cDNA plasmid was transfected into mice by hydrodynamic tail vein injection. To rule out the possibility that the soluble LSECtin protein blocks the interaction between LSECs and activated T cells, a full-length LSECtin cDNA encoding the membrane-bound protein also was transfected into mice by hydrodynamic tail vein injection. The expression of each in plasma and liver was confirmed by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay and Q-PCR, respectively (Supplementary Figure 5) . Considerable protective effects were observed in the transfected mice, which showed both a tremendous decrease in plasma ALT and AST levels ( Figure 7E ) and a clear amelioration of the histologic damage of hepatitis ( Figure 7F ). Thus, it could be concluded that LSECtin is not only a significant negative checkpoint in modulating hepatic T-cell activation, but also a new promising therapeutic target for acute liver inflammatory injury.\n\nThe liver is a unique immunologic organ, functioning either as a site amenable to effective immune responses to pathogenic microorganisms or in the generation of tolerance to portally derived food and probiotic antigens. The dual functions of the liver require a delicate balance between immunity and tolerance. 3, 21 The mechanisms behind the unique immune tolerance of liver have been elucidated in the past few years. One of the principal findings is that the T-cell biology in the liver is unlike that in any other organ, highlighted by the remarkable preference for the inactivation, tolerance, and apoptosis of hepatic T cells. 4 In TCR transgenic mice, activated CD8 \u03e9 T cells dispersed from the lymph nodes and spleen, and an increased number of activated CD8 \u03e9 T cells simultaneously were found undergoing apoptosis in the liver. 22 This phenomenon appears to be specific and is evident in a variety of in vivo model systems, suggesting that the liver is a \"graveyard\" or \"killing field\" for activated T cells. 2 In a mouse liver transplant model, CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 T cells were found to infiltrate significantly and then undergo apoptosis in liver allografts. 23 Moreover, many clinical investigations have shown that intrahepatic hepatitis C virus-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells have functional alterations, including weak IFN-\u2425 production, impaired proliferation, and enhanced apoptosis, which is associated with viral persistence and the progression of the disease to a chronic phase. 24, 25 Obviously, the unique T-cell immune response contributes greatly to specific hepatic tolerance. The exact molecular mechanisms underlying hepatic immune regulation, however, have not been elucidated clearly.\n\nThe investigation of B7-H1 and its contribution to hepatic T-cell immune regulation is noteworthy. Iwai et al 5 found that expression of B7-H1 in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells could inhibit the function of activated T cells via a PD-1-dependent mechanism. Dong et al 26 discovered an important role for B7-H1 in controlling the deletion of activated intrahepatic CD8 \u03e9 T cells in the liver via a PD-1-independent mechanism. 26 It is highly likely that hepatic immune regulation is multifactorial. Furthermore, the broad expression of B7-H1 in vivo makes it difficult to solely explain the unique characteristics of hepatic immunity. It is reasonable to speculate about other novel and specific molecular mechanisms identified in the control of hepatic immunity.\n\nLSECtin is expressed specifically in LSECs and Kupffer cells. Its specific localization and roles in the negative regulation of T cells give rise to its important function in hepatic immunity and tolerance induction. Indeed, we showed that LSECtin negatively regulates T-cell receptormediated signaling and T-cell immune response stimulated by plate-bound anti-CD3 mAb; this suppression could not be overcome by co-stimulation. Moreover, the role of LSECtin in the antigen-specific activation of T cells was analyzed using T cells from TCR transgenic mice and murine LSECs with physiologic levels of LSECtin expression. The lack of LSECtin in mice resulted in increased accumulation of T cells in the liver both in normal mice and in DO11.10 TCR transgenic T-cell transfer mice. In mice with T-cell-mediated acute liver injury, KO of LSECtin accelerated the disease caused by an increased T-cell immune response, whereas exogenous administration of recombinant LSECtin protein or plasmid ameliorated the disease via down-regulation of T-cell immunity. Thus, our study provides important insight into the molecular mechanism of hepatic T-cell constraint based on investigation of the liver-specific C-type lectin LSECtin.\n\nRecently, the importance of C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) was highlighted by the fact that they have a crucial immune regulatory role. First, CLRs on the surface of DCs could sense the extracellular environment and modulate cellular responses, especially the TLR-dependent inflammatory response. 27 Second, CLRs reversibly could modulate T-cell receptor signaling and exert effects on those immune cells. 10 This strongly implies that CLRs are important players in immune activation, tolerance, and homeostasis, and are involved in diseases of the immune system. It is noteworthy that several lectins also are localized to the liver, including galectin-1, 7 DC-SIGN, and L-SIGN. 28 None of the lectins, however, has been confirmed to be a T-cell regulator in liver thus far. In the present study, we showed that the liverspecific C-type lectin LSECtin recognized activated T cells and negatively regulated T-cell immune response in the liver. Our study not only expands the knowledge about BASIC-LIVER, PANCREAS, AND BILIARY TRACT"}
