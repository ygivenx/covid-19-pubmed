{"title": "Novel Viruses Associated with Gastroenteritis", "body": "). Many of these novel viruses have several characteristics in common: (i) small size, simple structure, and EM and physical characteristics; (ii) fastidious nature (inability to be cultured routinely); (iii) ability to elicit severe diarrhea that is easily alleviated by fluid and electrolyte replacement; and (iv) previously recognized and well known abilities to cause gastroenteritis in animals.\n\nThe following are brief descriptions of two well recognized and several novel viruses associated with gastroenteritis. References 1 through 8 are excellent sources of additional information on these viruses.\n\nRotavirus is a 70-nm, nonenveloped, 1 l-segment double-stranded (ds) RNA virus with two icosahedral capsids. It infects humans and most species of animals. Rotaviruses are members of the family Reoviridae and are named as such because of their wheellike appearance when observed by EM.\n\nTypical rotaviruses are intimately associated with severe gastroenteritis worldwide in the very young of all susceptible host species. The most commonly affected humans are children age 6 mo to 2 yr old.\n\nUntil 1982, rotaviruses were thought to be comprised of only one antigenic group (group A or \"typical\" rotaviruses) which is defined by the group antigen associated with the inner capsid and which causes diarrhea predom-\n\nNovel Gastroenteritis Viruses .... 137\n\nRecently discovered viruses responsible for epidemic and endemic gastroenteritis inantly in neonates and young children. In 1982, rotavirus group B was recognized as a human pathogen when it caused epidemics of gastroenteritis in China (9) . An interesting observation in the Chinese epidemics was the more common occurrence of illness in adults rather than in young children. Rotavirus group B has been detected sporadically in Australia, Brazil, and the U.S., and there is serological evidence that rotavirus group B has infected people in Southeast Asia (1) . However, significant rotavirus group B gastroenteritis has not occurred outside of China. Because rotavirus group B is a common diarrheal pathogen in swine, and has a segmented genome similar to that of influenza viruses (and is even grouped alphabetically like influenza viruses), phenotypic changes due to reassortment of the swine rotavirus group B genome could (or perhaps can in the future) have facilitated the ability of the swine virus to infect humans (1) .\n\nRotavirus group C is primarily a swine virus but has been detected in humans in the U.S. and other areas of the world, particularly England, Japan, Australia, and Brazil (1, 4, 10) . In the U.S., serological evidence suggests that exposure to rotavirus groups B and C has been minimal. Rotavirus groups D, E, and F have been found only in animals.\n\nRotavirus has been cultured in vitro in CV-1, LLC-MK2, AGMK, PCMK, and MA-I04 cells. However, culture is not commonly performed in clinical microbiology laboratories because culture of rotavirus often requires special procedures such as previous passage in fetal or gnotobiotic cell lines, pretreatment of specimens with trypsin, or the addition of trypsin to maintenance media. In addition, cytopathic effect is not consistently present or reproducible (4) .\n\nHistorically, rotavirus has been de-tected directly in stool specimens by EM. Specimens can be homogenized and diluted, negatively stained with phosphotungstic acid, and examined. Two reasons that this relatively simple and sensitive (albeit expensive) technique is still considered by some workers to be the standard method for detecting rotavirus are the large amount of virus shed in stools and the often relatively bacteria-free (clean) state of rotavirus-elicited stools. The EM technique requires the presence of > 106 virus particles/g feces for optimum sensitivity. In a technique known as immune electron microscopy (IEM), convalescent antirotavirus serum can be mixed with rotavirus purified from specimens and examined by EM. The resulting aggregates of virus are usually easily observed and exclude irrelevant particles with morphology similar to that of rotavirus. In addition, the method can provide information as to the serotype of the virus. Some workers have coated EM grids with Staphylococcus aureus protein A, adsorbed rotavirus-specific antiserum to the protein, and used these grids to serotype rotavirus (11, 121. Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and latex agglutination (LA) are more commonly used to detect rotavirus in stools than is EM because the former methods are considerably less expensive and labor-intensive, and do not require special equipment. EIA is probably at least as sensitive as EM. In addition, the large amount of antigen in rotavirus-elicited stools is usually ample for detection. Several commercial rotavirus E1A (both monoclonal and polyclonal antibody-based) and LA kits are available. The literature is replete with interproduct comparisons as well as comparisons of products with EM (4, 13, 14) . Reported sensitivities and specificities of EIA kits range from 50 to 100% and from 71 to 98%, respectively. Re-ported sensitivities and specilicitic,, ot LA kits range from 61 to 96+~ and from 72 to 100c~, respectively. Scnsv tivities and specificities appear to depend on the studied patient population (both are highest in neonatest and on the standards to which the products arc compared (EM or other kits).\n\nHemagglutination, counterimmunoelectrophoresis, immunofluorescence, complement fixation, and radioimlnunoassay also have been used to detect rotavirus antigens; however, these methods are not widely accepted because they are relatively insensitive, may require radiolabeled reagents, or are not practical for other reasons.\n\nSeveral methods to detect antirotavims IgG, IgM, and lgA have been described but these are not useful in the diagnosis of rotavirus infection and, therefore, are not commercially available.\n\nAdenovirus is a 70-nm, nonenveloped single-segment ds DNA virus with an icosahedral capsid which has a single fiber/spike at each vertex. Serological specificity is determined by the protein antigens of the capsid. All mammalian adenoviruses have a common antigen that can be easily detected by complement fixation.\n\nAdenoviruses are typed according to their serological specificities 141 known serotypes/species), protein composition (groups A through F), and nucleic acid restriction endonuclease patterns (groups A through G). In general, serotypes I-3 and 5-39, 4, 40, and 41 correspond to groups A-D, E, F, and G, respectively. For many years, adenovirus has been cultured from and has been observed by EM in stools from healthy individuals and from patients with gastroenteritis. However, an association between adenovirus and gastroenteritis has been made only over the last 15 NOTE.

During this time, \"enteric\" or \"fastidious\" (nonculturable except under special conditions) adenovirus types 40 and 41 and culturable type 31 have been found in patients with diarrhea significantly more often than in healthy individuals. Now, adenovirus types 31, 40, and 41 are recognized as occurring worldwide and as significant causes of diarrhea in children <~2 yr old (1, 4, 15) .\n\nElectron microscopy, EIA, nucleic acid probe hybridization, and special cell culture techniques have been used to detect adenovirus types 40 and 41. An EIA kit for adenovirus types 40 and 41 (Adenoclone-type 40/41; Cambridge BioScience, Worcester, Mass.) is available commercially. Adenovirus types 40 and 41 have been cultured in HeLa cells, conjunctival cells, and specially treated CMK cells (4, 16, 17) .\n\nNorwalk virus (Norwalk type virus) and Norwalklike viruses (also known as small, round, structured viruses) are 27-nm, round, and nonenveloped. The type of nucleic acid in Norwalk viruses is not known. The type virus of the group is the Norwalk virus (agent). Norwalk viruses have a simple but obvious structure that is characterized by an amorphous surface and irregular edges. Norwalk and Norwalklike viruses have similar structures, cause similar clinical gastroenteritis in older children and adults (rotavirus usually affects children <2 yr old), and are present in small numbers in diarrheal stools (rotavirus is present in large numbers). Norwalk viruses are firmly established as agents of gastroenteritis, and have caused many outbreaks of illness.\n\nNorwalk viruses have not been cultured in vitro. Physicochemical characteristics of the viruses have been determined by examining viruses partially purified from diarrheal stools. IEM has been the most commonly used method to examine stools tor Norwalk viruses, to examine the structure and antigenic relatedness of the viruses, and to determine diagnostic rises in antibody titers. EIA and RIA tests to detect Norwalk viruses have been developed and described (4, 6, 7) but are used almost exclusively for research and epidemiologic purposes.\n\nCaliciviruses are 30-nm, nonenveloped, single-stranded (ss) RNA( + ) viruses that have surface cup-shaped indentations that give the periphery of the virus a scalloped, 5-or 6-point star appearance. Calicivirus-elicited gastroenteritis is worldwide in distribution, does not occur frequently, usually affects children <5 yr old, and is not often distinguishable from that caused by rotavirus.\n\nHuman calicivirus is not culturable in vitro (although animal calicivirus is readily culturable) and is usually detected in stools by EM or IEM. EIAs and RIAs have been developed to detect calicivirus and antibody to calicivirus (4, 18) . The morphology, buoyant density, structural proteins, and antigenic characteristics of calicivirus are similar enough to those of Norwalk viruses to suggest that the two may be closely related (3, 4) .\n\nAstrovirus is 30 nm in diameter, contains ss RNA( + ), and does not have an envelope. The periphery of the virus is smooth, and the surface structure appears as a 5-or 6-point star, the points of which radiate from the center of the virus. There are at least five serotypes of astrovirus and at least one group antigen.\n\nAstrovirus is associated with foodand waterborne gastroenteritis, usually affects children <7 yr old, and is not as severe as infection caused by rotavirus and Norwalk viruses (3). Astrovirus usually is shed in extraordinarily large amounts.\n\nAstrovirus has been cultured in vitro in HEK, LLC-MK2, and CaCo-2 cells (4, 7) . EM and IEM are used to detect the virus in stools and to serotype the virus, lmmunofluorescence, IEM, and E1A (both mono-and polyclonal antibody-based) have been used to detect astrovirus antigens in stools and to detect diagnostic rises in antibody titer (19) .\n\nCoronavirus contains ss RNA(+) and is round, 80 to 140 nm in diameter, and enveloped. Coronavirus is morphologically distinct because of its clublike surface projections (peplomers), the distal ends of which surround each virion and give a coronalike appearance to the particle. Coronaviruses cause many diverse diseases in animals worldwide, respiratory diseases (predominantly common colds in children), and possibly, gastroenteritis in humans.\n\nThe presence of coronaviruslike particles in stools from people with gastroenteritis has been well documented by EM. However, a positive correlation between the presence of coronavirus and disease has not been demonstrated. Coronavirus is extremely difficult to culture in vitro and is often structurally distinct from classical (respiratory) coronavirus.\n\nThe laboratory diagnosis of coronavirus gastroenteritis is made by EM examination of stools and/or by demonstration of a rise in antibody titer after an acute infection. Antibody concentration can be measured against only two strains (229E and OC43) but can be detected by several techniques: neutralization, complement fixation, EIA, and immunofluorescence (4, 20) .\n\nPestivirus is ass RNA( + ) virus which is 50 nm in diameter, pleomorphic, probably icosahedral, enveloped, and difficult to identify by EM. Pestivirus is widely recognized as a cause of highly economically important diseases in animals, but has never been demonstrated in or to cause disease in humans, either directly or indirectly (21, 22) .\n\nRecently, a monoclonal antibodybased EIA was developed and used to demonstrate pestivirus antigens in 23% of the stools of children <2 yr of age with gastroenteritis that was not attributable to recognized enteric pathogens (22) . Similar methods have been used to detect pestivirus-associated gastroenteritis and pestivirus exposure in the United States, Bangladesh, and Peru (1, 2 \n\nPicobirnavirus was previously thought to cause diarrhea in animals; however, human cases of picobirnavims-associated diarrhea have been reported in Brazil (1).\n\nParvovirns are ss DNA viruses that are 20 nm in diameter, nonenveloped, icosahedral, and not culturable in vitro. Parvoviruses are most recognized for causing numerous diseases in animals and erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) in children. However, parvovirnslike particles have been observed (by EM) in the stools of gastroenteritis patients and healthy individuals, and have been associated with shellfish-related gastroenteritis (1) ."}
