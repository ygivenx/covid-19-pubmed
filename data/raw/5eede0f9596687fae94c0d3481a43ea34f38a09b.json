{"title": "Design, synthesis and crystallographic analysis of nitrile-based broad-spectrum peptidomimetic inhibitors for coronavirus 3C-like proteases", "body": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) cause a number of respiratory tract and gastroenteritis diseases in human and animals [1] . Coronaviruses can be classified into three main groups: alphacoronavirus (group 1), betacoronavirus (group 2), and gammacoronavirus (group 3), while the group 2 is further sub-divided into group 2a and 2b [2] . In addition to the SARS-CoV (group 2b) that caused the outbreak of pneumonia in 2003, the four human group 1 (229E and NL63) and 2 (OC43 and HKU1) strains are associated with up to 5% of respiratory tract disease cases reported [3, 4] . The single-stranded RNA genome of CoVs encodes two polyproteins, which are processed into at least 15 mature proteins by papain-like protease and 3C-like protease (3CL pro ) [5, 6] . Inhibition of the proteolytic processing can reduce viral replication and viral-induced cytotoxic effect [5, 6] . The ability of coronaviruses to generate novel strains with high virulence through high frequency of mutations and recombination remains a potential threat to human health. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a broad-spectrum drug that can combat against all kinds of coronavirus infection. Because 3CL pro is essential to viral replication and its active-site structure is conserved, the protease is an attractive drug target for the development of such a broadspectrum inhibitor [7] . The SARS-CoV 3CL pro can be inactivated by peptidomimetic inhibitors that are composed of a substrate-like peptide and a reactive warhead such as an aldehyde [8, 9] , a Michael acceptor [7, 10, 11] , a halo-methyl ketone [10, 12] , or an epoxide [13] . The peptide interacts with the substrate-binding cleft of the protease to form a non-covalent complex, and then the warhead covalently links with the catalytic cysteine residue and inhibits the enzyme.\n\nIn this study, we have shown that the nitrile group is an effective warhead against 3CL pro . Here, based on the auto-cleavage sequence of SARS-CoV 3CL pro (TSAVLQY), four nitrile-based inhibitors with different length of peptide sequences and protective groups were designed and synthesized. We have shown that these inhibitors were effective against 3CL pro from six different strains of CoVs with IC 50 values in the mM range. The crystal structures of the four enzymeeinhibitor complexes were determined to reveal the mechanism of inhibition and the enzymeeinhibitor interactions.\n\nBased on the autocleavage tetrapeptide sequence (AVLQ) of SARS-CoV 3CL pro , three nitrile-based inhibitors with different protective groups, 5-methylisoxazole-3-carboxyl (Mic), tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) and carboxybenzyl (Cbz), were synthesized (Scheme 1). The protease activity in the presence of inhibitors was measured by using a fluorescent-protein substrate as described previously [14, 15] . The IC 50 values of 'Mic-AVLQ-CN', 'Boc-AVLQ-CN', and 'Cbz-AVLQ-CN' were 49 AE 2, 49 AE 2, and 4.6 AE 0.2 mM, respectively ( Fig. 1) . Interestingly, the inhibitor with the Cbz protective group was w10x more potent than the other inhibitors tested. To test the effect of increasing the length of the peptidomimetic inhibitor, we synthesized a hexapeptide inhibitor 'Cbz-TSAVLQ-CN'. The IC 50 value for this inhibitor was 39 AE 1 mM (Fig. 1) , suggesting that increasing the length of the inhibitor did not improve inhibition and the Cbz group at the P4 position may be responsible for the higher potency of 'Cbz-AVLQ-CN'.\n\nTo better understand the enzymeeinhibitor interaction, we determined the crystal structures of SARS-CoV 3CL pro in complex with the four inhibitors at 1.95e2.5 A resolution (Table S1 , Supplementary data). The 3CL pro formed a dimer in the crystal structure, and the inhibitors occupied the substrate binding site in both protomers. Electron density was observed for the tetrapeptide (AlaeValeLeueGln) at P1 to P4 positions for all inhibitor complexes (Fig. S1 , Supplementary material). Overlaying these inhibitor structures demonstrated that the tetrapeptides adopted the same conformation when bound to the 3CL pro . On the other hand, the protective group of 'Mic-AVLQ-CN', the P5-Ser and P6-Thr of 'Cbz-TSAVLQ-CN' were disordered and not observable in the electron density. Scheme 1. Reaction scheme of nitrile-based peptidomimetic inhibitor synthesis.\n\nStep (a) was the coupling of peptides by using N,N 0 -dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and Nhydroxysuccinimide.\n\nStep (b) was the coupling of peptides by the mixed anhydride method.\n\nStep (c) was the deprotection of benzyl carbamates by using palladium on charcoal.\n\nStep (d) was the deprotection of Boc, Trt, Pbf groups and tertiary butyl esters by using trifluoroacetic acid.\n\nStep (e) was the transformation of primary amide to nitrile by using trifluoroacetic anhydride. Final products were highlighted with dashed box. In SARS-CoV, the catalytic dyad consists of Cys145 and His41 [16] . The inhibitor was covalently bonded with the thiol group of Cys145 via the carbon atom of the nitrile warhead ( Fig. 2A) . This mechanism is consistent with that observed in other cysteine proteases [17] . The side chains of P1-Gln, P2-Leu and P4-Ala occupied the S1, S2 and S4 subsites, respectively, of SARS-CoV 3CL pro , while the side-chain of P3-Val pointed towards the solvent ( Fig. 2A) . A number of hydrogen bonds are involved in enzymeeinhibitor interactions. The P1-Gln side chain was hydrogen-bonded with the backbone O atom of Phe140 and the side-chain of His163 and Glu166. The backbone amide groups of P2 to P4 formed hydrogen bonds with Glu166, Gln189 and Thr190, and these hydrogen bonds help the P3 and P4 residues to adopt a bstrand like conformation (Fig. 2B) .\n\nNoteworthy, the aromatic ring of the Cbz group is docked into a pocket where the ring can form favourable hydrophobic interactions with Pro168 and P3-Val (Fig. 2C ). These extra interactions, which are absent in other enzymeeinhibitor complexes, may enhance the binding affinity between 3CL pro and increase the potency of the 'Cbz-AVLQ-CN' inhibitor.\n\nNext, we tested if the 'Cbz-AVLQ-CN' inhibitor has broadspectrum inhibition against 3CL pro from different groups of coronaviruses. We measured and compared the IC 50 values of 'Cbz-AVLQ-CN' against 3CL pro from human coronavirus (HCoV) strains 229E (group 1), NL63 (group 1), OC43 (group 2a), HKU1 (group 2a), SARS-CoV (group 2b), and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (group 3). Our results showed that 'Cbz-AVLQ-CN' can inhibit all 3CL pro tested, with values of IC 50 ranging from 1.3 to 4.6 mM (Fig. 3) . In contrast, the 'Cbz-AVLQ-CN' had no observable inhibition effect on caspase-3 at 0.5e256 mM (Fig. S2, Supplementary material) , suggesting that the inhibitor is specific for 3CL pro from coronaviruses. As structures of 3CL pro from group 1, 2a, 2b, and 3 are similar, our modelling study suggests that the 'Cbz-AVLQ-CN' inhibitor can fit nicely to the active site of 3CL pro from all groups of coronaviruses and inhibit the protease via the same mechanism (Fig. S3 , Supplementary material). \n\nIn this study, we have shown that nitrile-based peptidomimetic inhibitors display broad-spectrum inhibition against 3CL pro from all groups of coronaviruses. Crystal structures of enzymee inhibitor complexes provide interesting insights in the design of peptidomimetic inhibitors. First, the enzymeeinhibitor binding is mainly determined by the tetrapeptide sequence, AVLQ. This suggestion is consistent with the observation that extending the length of the inhibitor to hexapeptide ('Cbz-TSAVLQ-CN') did not improve inhibition (Fig. 1) . Second, we found that the Cbz protective group at the N-terminus of the tetrapeptide can result in w10 fold increases in potency in the 'Cbz-AVLQ-CN' inhibitor than the other inhibitors tested. This observation suggests that modification of the peptidomimetics, e.g. cross-linking the P3-Val with the Cbz groups, may further improve the efficacy of inhibition. Because of the high recombination frequency among the RNA genome of CoVs, development of a broad-spectrum inhibitor is an attractive strategy to combat against infection of all kinds of CoVs [7] . Here, we have shown that the nitrile-based inhibitor 'Cbz-AVLQ-CN' can inhibit 3CL pro from all groups of CoVs tested with IC 50 values in the mM range. As nitrile-based protease inhibitors (e.g. odanacatib [18] , vildagliptin [19] ) have been successful in clinical applications [20] , our work demonstrated that the inhibitors described in this study may serve as a lead for the developmentof antiviral drugs that target a broad-spectrum of coronaviruses.\n\nThe reaction scheme for inhibitor synthesis is summarized in Scheme 1. 5-Methylisoxazole-3-carboxylic acid (Mic-OH), N,N 0dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), N-hydroxysuccinimide (HOSu) were purchased from SigmaeAldrich. Identities of the final products were verified by 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry analysis.\n\nIn part 1, to a stirred suspension of N-protected-amino acid-OH or N-protected-peptide-OH (1.0 equiv) and HOSu (1.1 equiv) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) (20 mL/mmol), DCC (1.1 equiv) in THF was added to the solution at 0 C. The reaction mixture was stirred for 30 min at the same temperature and 6 h at 25 C. N,N 0dicyclohexylurea was then removed by filtration and the filtrate was collected. In part 2, the amino acid was dissolved in THF/H 2 O (v/v \u00bc 1:1), then the pH of the solution was adjusted to 9 with 2 M K 2 CO 3 . The filtrate from part 1 was added to the solution at 0 C. This mixture was stirred for 30 min at 0 C and overnight at 25 C. Solvents were then evaporated in vacuo and the pH of the residue was adjusted to acidic with citric acid at 0 C and extracted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc). The combined extracts were washed with brine, dried (MgSO 4 ), filtered and evaporated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel to give the desired compound.\n\nN-protected-amino acid-OH or N-protected-peptide-OH (1 equiv) was dissolved in THF and cooled to \u00c015 C. To the stirred solution, N-methylmorpholine (NMM) (1 equiv) and isobutylchloroformate (1 equiv) were added consecutively. After precipitation of N-methylmorpholine hydrochloride, the amine (1 equiv) was added and the mixture was allowed to warm to 25 C within 30 min. It was stirred for additional 90 min, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in EtOAc and the solution was washed with H 2 O, saturated NaHCO 3 , 5% citric acid and brine. The solvent was dried (MgSO 4 ) and evaporated. The crude residue was purified by flash column chromatography to give the product.\n\nTo a stirred solution of the benzyl carbamate (1.0 equiv) in MeOH, palladium on charcoal (benzyl carbamate/palladium on charcoal \u00bc 1 g/100 mg) was added. The solution was evacuated, placed under H 2 (1 atm), and stirred for 1 h. The reaction was monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC). The suspension was then filtered through Celite and washed with MeOH. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to afford the desired amine.\n\nTo a stirred solution of the starting materials (1.0 equiv) in CH 2 Cl 2 , TFA (16.0 equiv) was added. The solution was stirred at 25 C and monitored by TLC. The CH 2 Cl 2 /TFA solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was diluted with toluene and the solvent was removed once again under reduced pressure.\n\nTo a stirred cold solution (0 C) of the primary amide (1.0 equiv) in dry THF and Et 3 N (2.2 equiv), trifluoroacetic anhydride (1.1 equiv) was added over 5 min. The solution was allowed to warm to 25 C. After 30 min, the reaction was quenched with H 2 O. The THF was removed under reduced pressure, and the product was extracted with EtOAc. The combined extracts were washed with saturated NaHCO 3 , 5% citric acid and brine, dried (MgSO 4 ), filtered and evaporated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel to give the desired compound.\n\n4.1.6. Identification of products by NMR and mass spectrometry 4.1.6.1. Mic-AVLQ-CN. After this compound was synthesized by following the procedure as described in Section 4.1.2, the product was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel to afford the target compound (yield \u00bc 64%). R f : 0.7 (EtOAc/MeOH \u00bc 4/1). 1 \n\nThe detailed procedures for the production of 3CL pro , fluorescent substrate, and protease assay for 3CL pro were described previously [14, 15] . 3CL pro at 0.5e1 mM were pre-mixed with 0.5e256 mM of inhibitors for 5 min, followed by addition of 35 mM substrate. The decay of fluorescence at 530 nm was fitted to a single-exponential decay to yield the observed rate constant (k obs ) and k obs /[3CL pro ]. The values of k obs /[3CL pro ] at different concentration of inhibitors were normalized by those without inhibitors to determine the relative protease activities, which were fitted to a four-parameter logistics equation to obtain the IC 50 values.\n\nSARS-CoV 3CL pro was crystallized at 16 C using the hangingdrop-vapour-diffusion method by mixing 5 mg/mL 3CL pro in 1:1 ratio with 50 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid, pH 5.5, 8.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 3% (v/v) DMSO, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and 1 mM dithiothreitol. Single crystals were transferred to 5 mL of the mother liquor with 600 mM inhibitors. After incubation at 16 C overnight, the crystals were cryoprotected by 20% (v/v) glycerol, and diffraction data were collected at 110 K in an in-house Rigaku FRE \u00fe X-ray source. The phase was solved by molecular replacement, the models were built interactively by the program COOT [21] and refined by PHENIX [22] ."}
