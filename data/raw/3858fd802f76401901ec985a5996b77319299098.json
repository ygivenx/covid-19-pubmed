High resolution spectra were obtained with the Bruker Apex-Q IV 7T or the Bruker micrOTOF, respectively.\n\nThe synthesis of the homodimeric peptide species as well as the peptide/PNA conjugates were reported elsewhere (Schneggenburger et al. 2010) . Iodine labeled and non-labeled peptide hairpin species were synthesized via Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis using self-loaded resins of type NovaSyn TGA (0.26 mmol\uf0d7g -1 ) or Wang LL (0.44 mmol\uf0d7g -1 ).\n\nFor the attachment of the first amino acid, the resin was placed in a syringe equipped with a polyethylene-frit and swollen in NMP [= N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone] for 20 min. For loading of the resin, the Fmoc-amino acid (10 eq. relative to resin loading) was dissolved in dry DCM [= dichloromethane] using a separate flask. DIC [= diisopropylcarbodiimide] (10 eq.) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred for 20 min at 0 \u00b0C. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was re-dissolved in NMP yielding an approx. 0.4 M solution of the respective amino acid. DMAP [= 4-dimethylamino-pyridine] dissolved in a minimum S3 of NMP (0.1 eq. relative to resin loading) was added and the reaction mixture was immediately transferred to the resin. During loading reaction the syringe containing the loading mixture was vigorously shaken for 1 h. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was filtered and the resin was thoroughly washed with NMP. The loading procedure was repeated one or two times, depending on the estimated loading density. The resin loading was estimated via UV analysis of the dibenzofulven concentration resulting from Fmocdeprotection. Therefore, the particular resin (5 mg) was placed in a graduated flask (10 mL) and DBU [= 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4 .0]undec-7-en] in NMP (2% solution) was added. After gently shaking for 1 h, while the resin should always be covered by the deprotection solution, the reaction mixture was diluted with acetonitrile to 10 mL. The solution was further diluted with acetonitrile (1/12.5) and transferred to a UV cell (1 cm \uf0b4 1 cm). The absorption of the cleaved Fmoc species was detected at 304 nm (\u03b5 304 = 7624 L mol -1 \uf0d7cm -1 ) (Gude et al. 2002) .\n\nWhen the loading density of the resin was considered to be sufficient, the remaining free \n\nScattering an In-house Experiments "}
