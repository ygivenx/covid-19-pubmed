{"title": "Viral Infections and the Development of Disinfection: 100 Years of\nProgress at I&ECR", "body": "Headlines worldwide these last several months have been filled with references to\nCOVID-19, the illness resulting from infection with a new strain of coronavirus.\nEfforts by health officials to control the spread of the virus have led to\nquarantines and cancellations of large gatherings including sporting events in\nlocations where infections are known to have occurred. Scientific life also is\naffected with the American Physical Society, World Petrochemical Conference, ACS,\nand AIChE among those canceling or postponing their recent annual spring\nconferences.1 Some local meetings and the recently\nconcluded Pittsburgh Analytical Conference (Pittcon) were held, but with fewer\nattendees than expected due to travel restrictions and personal and organizational\ndecisions to avoid large gatherings.2\n\nWe remember that about 100 years ago, at the end of the first world war, a virulent\nstrain of influenza virus raced around the world, causing the death of an\nestimated 30 million people\u2014more than were killed in the war itself. At\nthat time, life was different because the war had significantly decreased economic\nproductivity, disinfectants were largely unknown or underutilized, and the only\nknown pain medication was aspirin.\n\nBy 1920, scientific reports began to appear in journals including\nI&ECR about significantly lower\ninfluenza sickness rates near chlorine facilities. Initial reports from the\nEdgewood Arsenal in Maryland\u2013where the United States had been producing\nCl2 as a chemical weapon for use in the war\u2013were quickly\nconfirmed at other locations where chlorine was used, such as in textile and paper\nmanufacture.3,4 In one case, at a plant where 15% of the workforce was\ninfected, no cases occurred in workers in the chlorine or bleach (sodium\nhypochlorite, NaOCl) portion of the factory. In another factory where 75% of the\nworkforce was infected, only one death occurred, and few serious cases were\nobserved. While these observations should raise significant questions about\nchemical hygiene and fugitive emissions at the plants, this was a time when\nscientists often carried out experiments on themselves or people they knew and\nsome level of exposure to chemicals was tolerated.5,6\n\nWhen combined with prior discoveries,7 these observations from\nindustry helped propel the case for chlorine-based disinfection and led to\nwidespread implementation of water chlorination processes with significant\nreductions in mortality rates.8,9 Additional rapid research and\ntechnological discoveries led to new preparation methods for NaOCl,10 and the commercial production of chlorine containing solutions\nas disinfectants.11 Subsequent improvements included advanced\nelectrolytic cells for chlorine production,12 and production of\ndisinfectant and bactericide N-chloramines with fewer drawbacks than\nCl2.13,14 Throughout, process safety has continually increased with\ntime.15,16\n\nResearch in the field continues today, but with highly sophisticated tools, such that\nstudies of the interaction of Cl2 with viruses can detail penetration\nthrough lipid membranes and reaction with protein cores.17 We\nalso understand how to synthesize materials incorporating N-chloroamines into\npolymers to prepare materials with multiple beneficial\nproperties.18,19\n\nWhile we do not yet know what discoveries will come from the many ongoing\ninvestigations related to SARS-CoV-2,20 one constant has\nremained fixed during a century of progress.\nI&ECR is the top journal for reports\nof industrial and chemical engineering observations and research relevant to the\nworld.\n\nThe observations, conclusions and opinions in this editorial are the Author\u2019s\nand not necessarily those of Honeywell International Inc. or UOP LLC."}
