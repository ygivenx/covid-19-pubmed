{"title": "Journal Pre-proof COVID-19 -the role of mass gatherings COVID-19 -the role of Mass Gatherings", "body": "However, the events in the context of the latest threat to global health, the PHEIC COVID-19, may be sufficient to highlight the role of mass gatherings, mass migration, and other forms of dense gatherings of people in congested spaces such as cruise ships on the emergence, sustainability and transmission of novel pathogens (4). In early December 2019, the first pneumonia cases of unknown origin were identified in Wuhan, city with a population of 11 million. By the time the causative agent was recognized (now named SARS-CoV-2), and the epidemiology was being studied, the spring festival in China, the largest mass migration of people in the world had already began. Pakistan. The outbreak did not slow down as was seen in any of the countries earlier, and by the time national authorities were aware, the virus has taken foothold nationwide mostly spread via returning pilgrims and fellow travelers, and to neighboring countries, it was too late for containment efforts and mitigation would remain the only hope. As of March 1, case count in Iran was 593 cases and 43 deaths.\n\n(https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/685d0ace521648f8a5beeeee1b9125cd) Huge cruise ships scenario also fit the description of mass gatherings as the density of people occupying the limited space exceeds what is normally observed in other living areas in the land.\n\nLarge cruise ships, including the Diamond Princess, that was quarantined in Japan due to COVID-19 outbreak, carry 2,000 to 4,000 persons, circumstances where social distancing is almost unachievable. Confining passengers inside the ship, a misjudged containment strategy, lead to 17% of the 3,700 passengers and crew being infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. The cruise ship condition enabled a highly transmissible disease to sustain an outbreak. (3,7) The significance of mass gatherings to disease transmission is directly linked to the efficiency of transmission expressed in epidemiologic terms as the basic reproduction number or R 0 . The most recent analysis of 425 cases at the epicenter of COVID-19 crisis in Wuhan indicate an R 0 of 2.2.\n\nThis indirectly means that the number affected will double within the incubation period.
