{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Donor Heart Selection During The COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Study", "body": "In recent weeks, the number of cases of COVID-19 has surged worldwide 1 . It is unclear how transplant programs should approach donors with possible COVID-19 infection, especially when real-time testing for SARS-CoV-2 is not widely available or impractical due to increased processing time. We review the issues surrounding evaluation of our first donor offer from a deceased patient with possible COVID-19\n\ninfection and decisions despite uncertain information.\n\nIn early 2020, a child with end-stage heart failure hospitalized awaiting heart transplant, received a donor heart organ offer. The donor progressed to brain death after presenting with an anoxic brain injury in the setting of a recent upper respiratory tract infection (URI). A nasopharyngeal swab was positive for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). A chest radiograph revealed patchy opacifications of the lung fields consistent with viral pneumonitis or aspiration. As part of the evaluation, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were given the opportunity to request testing for COVID-19, as the donor had not been previously tested. The donor resided in an area where confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection had been reported. Moreover, because the patient's viral symptoms fell within the past 21 days and the patient was hospitalized, the donor met Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for a person under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19 infection 2 . However, because COVID-19 testing was still in limited use, COVID-19 testing would require an additional 1-3 days to process, a relatively long time period for an OPO to maintain the donor's medical eligibility to donate and for a grieving donor family to wait.\n\nAs the offer was contemplated, a number of questions rapidly surfaced. These included: (1) What is the likelihood of COVID-19 infection in a patient whose viral symptoms have resolved, COVID-19 testing status is unknown, but a common respiratory virus has been identified? testing could be performed and was negative and the donor family agreed to wait the additional time.\n\nThe COVID-19 test, performed on a nasopharyngeal swab using a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay, returned negative, and the donor heart was accepted for transplantation.\n\nHowever, a single negative test may not reliably exclude the diagnosis of COVID-19 and the sensitivity may vary depending upon the sample source (anecdotal reports from adult patients suggest that bronchoalveolar lavage specimens may have the highest yield). So repeat testing in the either donor or recipient may be warranted. The purpose of this case anecdote is to define the issues that may need to be reconciled as decisions are being made during the evolution of this pandemic."}
