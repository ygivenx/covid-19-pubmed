{"title": "IL-27 enhances the survival of tumor antigen-specific CD8 + T cells and programs them into IL-10-producing, memory precursor-like effector cells", "body": "Interleukin-27 (IL-27) is a member of the IL-12 cytokine family that consists of an IL-12 p40-related protein subunit, EBV-induced gene 3 (EBI3), and a p35-related subunit, p28 [1] . IL-27 is mainly produced by antigen presenting cells (APCs) and signals through a heterodimeric receptor (IL-27R) consisting of the WSX-1 and the gp130 subunits [2] . IL-27-IL-27R interaction enhances the recruitment of several Jak family kinases and the activation of STAT family transcription factors 1 and 3 [3] [4] .\n\nIL-27 is a pleiotropic cytokine capable of regulating Th1, Th2, Th17, and FoxP3 + Treg-cell responses [5] . Since Hisada et al. [6] first reported the anti-tumor efficacy of IL-27, the potent antitumor activity of IL-27 has been verified in various tumor models, and many studies have shown CD8 + T-cell-dependent tumor rejection [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . The enhancing roles of endogenous IL-27 in the generation of anti-tumor CTL responses were also demonstrated using IL-27R\u03b1-deficient mice [11] [12] . Although these studies provide a strong case for the role of IL-27 in inducing anti-tumor CTL responses, it remains unclear how IL-27 enhances anti-tumor CTL responses. One possibility is that IL-27 directly enhances CTL differentiation and effector functions since IL-27 has been shown to promote CD8 + T cells to express T-bet, IL-12R\u03b22, and granzyme B [13] [14] .\n\nIL-27 can induce IL-10 production in CD8 + T cells [15] [16] . However, the relevance of IL-27-induced IL-10 production in CTL-mediated tumor rejection remains elusive. The role of IL-10 in tumor immunity is often controversial with increasing evidence supporting a positive role in the induction of anti-tumor CTL response. For instance, in IL-10-deficient mice, anti-tumor CTL responses were weakened [17] and increased numbers of FoxP3 + Treg cells were found [18] ; whereas in IL-10 transgenic mice, anti-tumor CTL responses were primed and shown to be responsible for tumor rejection [17, 19] . Since IL-27 directly stimulates CD8 + T-cell differentiation and promotes CTL IL-10 production, we hypothesize that these functions of IL-27 are involved in IL-27-mediated anti-tumor CTL response and tumor rejection. In the present study, we sought to test this hypothesis by using our wellestablished animal models. We have found that IL-27 significantly enhances the survival of activated tumor antigen specific CD8 + T cells in vitro and in vivo and induces a unique memory precursor (MPC) phenotype in tumor antigen-specific CD8 + T cells, characterized by up-regulation of Bcl-6, SOCS3, Sca-1, and IL-10. While STAT3 activation and the CTL survival-enhancing effects can be independent of CTL IL-10 production, we show here that IL-27-mediated CTL IL-10 production contributes to MPC phenotype induction, CTL memory, and tumor rejection.\n\nTo determine the direct effects of IL-27 on the activation and differentiation of tumor antigen specific CD8 + T cells, spleen and lymph node cells from P1CTL mice, whose CD8 + T cells bear a TCR transgene specific for tumor rejection antigen P1A, were stimulated with P1A35-43 in the presence or absence of recombinant IL-27. Cell numbers were counted every 24 hours for a period of 5 days. As shown in Fig.1A , P1CTL cells stimulated with IL-27 yielded significantly higher numbers of viable cells compared to cells stimulated with P1A peptide alone. To determine if IL-27 affects the survival of activated P1CTL cells, the cultured P1CTL cells were stained for Annexin V and 7-AAD to quantify cell apoptosis over time. The addition of IL-27 resulted in substantially reduced cell apoptosis of activated P1CTL cells (Fig.1B) . Similar results were obtained when purified CD8 + T cells from P1CTL mice were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3/anti-CD28 and IL-27 (not shown). Thus, IL-27 directly conveys a survival advantage to activated P1CTLs.\n\nTo test if IL-27 enhances P1CTL survival in vivo, mouse plasmacytoma J558 cells were transfected with an IL-27 expression vector or a control expression vector, and J558-IL-27 and J558-Ctrl cells were generated. J558 cells express tumor antigen P1A that can be specifically recognized by P1CTL cells [20] [21] . S.c. injection of 5\u00d710 6 J558-IL-27 or J558-Ctrl tumor cells into Rag-2 -/mice resulted in similar tumor growth (Fig.1C ). P1CTL cells were injected i.v. into Rag-2 -/mice bearing established tumors of similar size. Four days later, more P1CTL cells were detected in the spleens and tumors from mice bearing J558-IL-27 tumors compared with mice bearing J558-Ctrl tumors (Fig.1D ). Tumor infiltrating P1CTL cells from J558-IL-27 tumors also underwent less apoptosis compared with cells from J558-ctrl tumors (Fig.1E ). An in vivo proliferation assay suggested that the dividing rate of P1CTL cells was similar in the two different hosts (Fig.1F) . Thus, IL-27 also enhances the survival of activated P1CTLs in the tumor-bearing host and tumor microenvironment.\n\nOne of the known roles of IL-27 is to stimulate IL-10 production by CD8 + T cells [15] [16] .\n\nTo determine if IL-27 could induce IL-10 production in P1CTL cells in vivo, we injected P1CTL cells into Rag-2 -/mice bearing established J558-IL-27 or J558-Ctrl tumors. Four days after P1CTL transfer, we sacrificed mice and prepared single cell suspensions from both spleens and tumors, and stained cells for IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3. As demonstrated in Fig.2A and quantified in Fig.2B , the number of IL-10 + P1CTLs infiltrating into J558-IL-27 tumors was substantially increased compared with those in J558-Ctrl tumors. The number of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10-positive P1CTLs were low in spleens from both J558-IL-27 and J558-Ctrl tumorbearing mice.\n\nTo determine if IL-27 induction of IL-10 affects P1CTL cell effector functions, spleen and lymph node cells from P1CTL and IL-10 -/-P1CTL mice were stimulated with P1A peptide in the presence or absence of IL-27 for up to five days in vitro. As shown in Fig.3A and quantified in Fig.3B , starting on day 3, high numbers of IL-10 + IFN-\u03b3and IL-10 + IFN-\u03b3 + cells were detected in IL-27-stimulated WT P1CTL cells (Fig.3A , first row), while IL-10 + cells were undetectable in WT P1CTL cells in the absence of IL-27 (Fig.3A , second row), or in activated IL-10 -/-P1CTLs in the presence or absence of IL-27 (Fig.3A , third and fourth rows). Consistent with this observation, IL-10 mRNA expression was elevated more than 15 times in IL-27-stimulated WT P1CTLs relative to other cultures (Fig.3C ). Increased concentration of IL-10 protein in the culture supernatant from IL-27-stimulated WT P1CTLs was also detected (Fig.3D ). IL-27 stimulation resulted in slightly reduced numbers of IFN\u03b3 + cells (Fig.3A, Fig.3B ), reduced IFN-\u03b3 mRNA expression (Fig.3C) , and reduced amounts of IFN-\u03b3 secretion into the culture supernatants ( Fig.3D ) in both WT and IL-10 -/-P1CTLs. Since IL-27 equally inhibited IFN-\u03b3 production in WT and IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells, it is likely that the down-regulation of IFN-\u03b3 by IL-27 is IL-10 independent. However, IL-27differentiated P1CTL and IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells showed similar cytotoxicity to P1A antigen positive P815 cells (Fig.3E ).\n\nSince IL-27 stimulates high amounts of IL-10 production by P1CTL cells, we tested if the survival-enhancing effect of IL-27 was due to IL-10 production by P1CTL cells, as IL-10 has been shown to enhance CTL expansion [22] [23] . Spleen and lymph node cells from IL-10 -/-P1CTL mice were stimulated with P1A peptide in the presence or absence of IL-27, and the numbers of viable cells were counted once a day for a period of 5 days. As shown in Fig.4A , IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells cultured with IL-27 resulted in significantly higher numbers of viable cells compared with cells stimulated with P1A peptide alone. To determine if IL-27 affects the survival of activated IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells, cultured IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells were stained for Annexin V and 7-AAD to quantify cell death over time. The addition of IL-27 resulted in significantly reduced cell death of activated IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells (Fig.4B ). Similar results were obtained when purified CD8 + T cells from IL-10 -/-P1CTL mice were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3/anti-CD28 and IL-27 (not shown). These results suggest that IL-27 provides a survival advantage to activated IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells. To test if IL-27 stimulates IL-10 -/-P1CTL cell expansion in vivo, we injected IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells into Rag-2 -/mice bearing established tumors of similar size. Four days later, more IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells were detected in the tumors and spleens from mice bearing J558-IL-27 tumors (Fig.4C) . Thus, IL-27 induced IL-10 production does not affect IL-27 induced CTL survival in vitro and in vivo.\n\nTo determine the effects of IL-27 induced CTL IL-10 production in tumor rejection, we injected IL-27-stimulated WT P1CTLs, IL-27-stimulated IL-10 -/-P1CTLs, or P1A peptide alone-activated WT P1CTLs into J558 tumor-bearing Rag-2 -/mice and monitored their tumor growth. As shown in Fig.5A , IL-27-stimulated P1CTL had the best efficacy in rejecting established J558 tumors. In the second set of experiments, un-stimulated WT P1CTL or IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells were injected into Rag-2 -/- (Fig.5B ) or Rag-2 -/-IL-10 -/- (Fig.  5C ) mice with established J558-IL-27 tumors. Enhanced tumor rejection was observed in P1CTL cell-treated mice than IL-10 -/-P1CTL cell-treated mice in both models. Collectively, these data suggest that IL-27-induced IL-10 production by CTLs contributes to tumor rejection.\n\nSubcutaneous injection of J558-IL-27 cells into BALB/c mice barely established tumors, while J558-Ctrl cells established tumors that reached a size of ~800 mm 3 after 20 days (Fig.  5D ). Since J558-IL-27 tumors could be established in Rag-2 -/and showed similar growth kinetics to J558-Ctrl tumors, adaptive immunity must play a vital role in rejecting J558-IL-27 tumors. Indeed, the depletion of CD8 + T cells in BALB/c mice resulted in progressive growth of J558-IL-27 tumors (Fig.5E ), suggesting that IL-27-mediated tumor rejection in this model is CD8 + T-cell-dependent. To determine the role of IL-10 production in CTLmediated tumor rejection, IL-10 -/-BALB/c and BALB/c mice were inoculated with J558-IL-27 tumor cells s.c. No tumors grew in WT mice, but J558-IL-27 tumors established and grew in about 50% of IL-10 -/mice (Fig.5F ). Thus, CTL response rejected J558-IL-27 tumors in WT but not IL-10 -/mice.\n\nTo further understand the mechanisms of IL-27-mediated effects on tumor antigen specific CD8 + T cells, we examined the expression of a variety of survival and differentiation genes associated with CD8 + T cells [24] [25] in cultured WT P1CTL and IL-10-deficient P1CTL cells. As shown in Fig.6A , IL-27 significantly up-regulated the expression of SOCS3, Bcl-6, Sca-1, and Bcl-2 genes in both WT P1CTL and IL-10-deficient P1CTL cells. However, more significant induction of these genes was observed in WT P1CTL cells, expressions of Bcl-xl and T-bet genes were up-regulated by IL-27 to a lesser extent in both WT P1CTL and IL-10-deficient P1CTL cells, Blimp-1 and Perforin genes were up-regulated slightly by IL-27 in WT but not IL-10-deficient P1CTL cells. In contrast, expressions of Eomes and granzyme B genes were down-regulated in both WT P1CTL and IL-10-deficient P1CTL cells. IL-27 has been shown to activate STAT3 [3, 16] , and STAT3 activation is known to induce expression of SOCS3 [25] and the Bcl family of proteins [25] [26] [27] . Western blot (Fig.  6B ) and flow cytometry (Fig.6C ) analyses verified that IL-27 activated STAT3 and upregulated Bcl2, Bcl-6, SOCS3, Sca-1, and perforin while reduced the expression of Eomes and granzyme B in activated WT P1CTL cells; in IL-10-deficient P1CTL cells, IL-27 upregulated p-Stat3, Bcl-6, Sca-1 and down-regulated Eomes. However, IL-27 did not alter the expression of Bcl-2, SOCS3, Bcl-xl, granzyme B and Perforin at the protein level in IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells. IL-27 stimulation also reduced the expression of cleaved caspase 3, a key executer of apoptosis [28] , in activated WT and IL-10-deficient P1CTL cells (Fig.6B) . Thus, IL-27 induces a memory precursor cell (MPC) phenotype [25] in tumor antigen specific CD8 + T cells characterized by strong expression of Bcl-6, SOCS3 and Sca-1. However, in the absence of IL-10, the induction of MPC phenotype and survival molecules by IL-27 is diminished.\n\nRecent studies [25, 29] suggest that IL-10-mediated activation of STAT3 and the subsequent up-regulation of Bcl-6 and SOCS3 are the key features of CD8 + memory precursor cells that give rise to memory T cells. Since IL-27 is a potent inducer of IL-10 in P1CTL cells, and IL-27-stimulated P1CTL cells show activated STAT3, with up-regulated expression of SOCS3 and Bcl-6, we hypothesize that the IL-27/IL-10 axis plays important roles in promoting memory response of tumor antigen specific CD8 + T cells.\n\nThe critical features of memory T cells include their self renewal capacity, MHCindependent survival, and rapid secondary response to antigen [24, 30] . To test if IL-27activated P1CTL cells give rise to memory T cells, we developed an adoptive transfer animal model. Ten million P1A35-43 peptide and IL-27 activated P1CTL or IL-10 -/-P1CTL (H-2 d ) cells were adoptively transferred into each NK-depleted Rag1 -/-ebi3 -/-C57BL6 mouse (H-2 b ) [31] . Due to MHC mismatch, only memory T cells can survive in the mice. In this model, IL-27 is absent, thus the adoptively transferred T cells are not exposed to endogenous IL-27, and the memory T-cell pool reflects the original qualities of MPCs. As demonstrated in Fig.7A , similar numbers of CD8 + V\u03b18.3 + cells were detected in the blood of the two groups of recipient mice by day 1 after T-cell transfer; by day 7 after T cell transfer, mice receiving 1 \u00d7 10 7 activated P1CTL cells experienced a significant expansion and had significantly higher numbers of CD8 + V\u03b18.3 + T cells than mice receiving 1 \u00d7 10 7 IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells. By day 32 after T-cell transfer, a reduced, but distinctive, population of CD8 + V\u03b18.3 + T cells could still be detected in both groups. However, mice receiving P1CTL cells had significantly higher numbers of CD8 + V\u03b18.3 + T cells than mice receiving IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells (Fig.7A ). Upon challenge with J558 tumor cells, P1CTL recipient mice showed significantly diminished tumor growth compared to IL-10 -/-P1CTL recipient mice (Fig.7B ). The tumors from IL-10 -/-P1CTL recipients also had much less infiltration of CD8 + V\u03b18.3 + T cells compared to tumors from WT P1CTL recipients (Fig.7C) . Thus, mice receiving IL-27 activated P1CTL cells had a stronger memory T-cell response compared with mice receiving IL-27 activated IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells.\n\nExpression of IL-27 in tumor cells triggers potent anti-tumor immunity, most notably CTL responses in vivo [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . However, the underlying mechanisms are not very clear. In this study, we sought to understand this issue by analyzing the direct effects of IL-27 on tumor antigen specific CTLs using our well-established tumor models [32] . We have made the following three major observations that could explain why IL-27 enhances anti-tumor CTL responses and tumor rejection. First, IL-27-stimulated CTLs have survival advantage. Second, IL-27 induces IL-10 production by tumor antigen specific CTL cells, which contributes to CTL-mediated tumor rejection. Third, IL-27 induces a unique MPC/effector cell phenotype in activated CD8 + T cells, characterized by up-regulation of SOCS3, Bcl-6, Sca-1, and IL-10, and gives rise to memory T cells. IL-27-induced CTL IL-10 production contributes to the induction of MPC phenotype and T cell memory.\n\nA notable observation of this study is that IL-27 confers a survival advantage to activated CTLs in vitro and in vivo. The pro-survival effect was observed in both IL-27-stimulated WT and IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells, suggesting that the anti-apoptotic effect of IL-27 is independent of IL-27-induced IL-10 production. IL-27 and IL-10 both activate Stat3 [3, 16, 25] , and activation of Stat3 is known to up-regulate Bcl family of molecules [25] [26] [27] . Indeed, in this study we found that IL-27-stimulated CTLs down-regulated production of cleaved caspase-3 and up-regulated a number of bcl family genes, including bcl-2, bcl-6 and bcl-xl. Thus, the IL-27-mediated pro-survival effect is associated with activation of Stat3-Bcl antiapoptosis pathways. Although IL-27 promotes survival of IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells, western blot analysis revealed a notable reduction of IL-27-induced Bcl2 protein compared with IL-27stimulated WT P1CTL cells. This result suggests that IL-10-deficiency may affect CTL survival in more physiological conditions where high levels of IL-27 are not available. This point is supported by our finding that the long term survival of IL-27-stimulated IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells was impaired in vivo (Fig.7) . The strong anti-apoptosis effect of IL-27 could explain why, in tumor models, more CTLs accumulate in the IL-27-positive tumor microenvironment.\n\nIn this study, we also demonstrate that IL-27-induced IL-10 production by CD8 + T cells contributes to their anti-tumor efficacy. This conclusion is supported by three lines of evidence. First, adoptive transfer of IL-27-stimulated P1CTL cells, which produce high amounts of IL-10, had better therapeutic efficacy than IL-27-stimulated IL-10-deficient P1CTL. Second, adoptive transfer of P1CTL or IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells into Rag2 -/or Rag2 -/-IL-10 -/mice with established J558-IL-27 tumors shows that P1CTL cells can reject tumors better than IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells. Third, J558-IL-27 tumor cells, which failed to grow into tumors in BALB/c mice due to a potent anti-tumor CTL response, could grow into tumors in IL-10 -/-BALB/c mice. IL-10-producing CD8 + T cells are usually considered as suppressor cells that down-regulate T-cell responses [33] . However, recent studies showed that IL-10 producing CTLs were more highly activated and cytolytic than IL-10-deficient CTLs [17, 34] . In this study, we found that IL-27-stimulated IL-10-deficient CTLs expressed similar levels of IFN-\u03b3, granzyme B and perforin, and exhibited similar levels of cytotoxicity to target cells compared to their WT counterparts. However, IL-10-deficiency significantly reduced the expression of IL-27-induced survival molecules, such as SOCS3, Bcl-2, and Bcl-6 in CTLs. Thus, IL-27 induced CTL IL-10 production increases their survival potential, which can lead to stronger CTL responses. Our finding that IL-27 induced CTL IL-10 production contributes to their efficacy in tumor rejection suggests that IL-10 producing CTLs are better effectors rather than suppressor cells.\n\nIn this study, we found that IL-27-stimulated CD8 + T cells had a mixed memory precursor/ effector phenotype. IL-27 significantly up-regulates STAT3 responsive molecules SOCS3, Bcl-6, Sca-1, and IL-10 in P1CTL. SOCS3 and Bcl-6 have recently been shown to be critical in establishing CD8 + T cell memory [25] . Sca-1 is a cell membrane molecule usually expressed on self-renewing stem cells and is a marker of central memory CD8 + T cells [35] [36] . IL-10 has also been shown to play a vital role in CD8 + T-cell memory [37] , presumably via induction of SOCS3 [25] . In this study we find that in the absence of IL-10, the capacity for IL-27 induction of MPC phenotype in CD8 + T cells is greatly diminished, which is mainly reflected by reduced expression of SOCS3, Bcl-2, and Bcl-6. Adoptive transfer experiments suggest that IL-10-deficient CD8 + T cells do not give rise to good memory response compared to IL-27-stimulated WT P1CTL cells. Thus, IL-27 induced CTL IL-10 production contributes to MPC induction and CTL memory.\n\nThe expression of SOCS3, Bcl-6, Sca-1, and IL-10 in CTLs support a role for IL-27 in induction of the MPC phenotype in CTLs. However, we also found that IL-27 up-regulated the expression of T-bet, Blimp-1, and Perforin, down-regulated the expression of Eomes, IFN-\u03b3, and slightly down-regulated granzyme B. Up-regulation of T-bet and downregulation of Eomes have been demonstrated in IL-12-stimulated CD8 + T cells previously [38] , and are associated with CD8 + T-cell differentiation into effector but not memory T cells [25, 38] . The controversy of up-regulation of T-bet with down-regulation of IFN-\u03b3 in P1CTL can be explained by IL-27 induction of Bcl-6, which has been shown to inhibit Tbet-induced IFN-\u03b3 production [39] . Collectively, these results suggest that IL-27 programs tumor antigen specific CD8 + T cells into MPC-like effector cells. This phenotype can potentially increase CTL \"stemness\", without affecting their effector functions such as cytotoxicity. Interestingly, recent studies in humans [40] and mice [41] demonstrate that other effector T cells, such as Th17 cells, also have stem cell characteristics with prolonged survival, suggesting that effector cell \"stemness\" may be a universal mechanism for maintaining long term survival of effector T cells.\n\nTaken together, we show that IL-27 significantly enhances the survival of activated tumor antigen specific CD8 + T cells in vitro and in vivo. IL-27 induces STAT3 activation and programs tumor antigen specific CD8 + T cells into MPC-like effctor cells. While STAT3 activation and the CTL survival-enhancing effects can be independent of CTL IL-10 production, we show that IL-27-mediated CTL IL-10 production contributes to MPC phenotype induction, CTL memory and tumor rejection. These findings have important implications for the design of human cancer immunotherapy. For instance, since IL-27 enhances CTL memory response, it could be used as an adjuvant to boost anti-cancer vaccine efficacy as demonstrated in the case of IL-12 and IL-27 combined gene therapy [10] . In addition, IL-27 could also be used for optimal ex vivo expansion of tumor infiltrating CD8 + T lymphocytes for CTL adoptive transfer therapy of human cancer.\n\nMice BALB/c and IL-10 -/-BALB/c mice were originally purchased from The Jackson Laboratories. Rag2 -/-BALB/c mice were purchased from Taconic Farms (Germantown, New York, USA). Transgenic mice expressing a TCR specific for the tumor antigen P1A (P1CTL), whose TCR recognizes H-2L d :P1A35-43 complex, have been described [20] . We previously generated Rag2 -/-IL-10 -/- [21] and Rag1 -/-ebi3 -/mice [31] . IL-10 -/-P1CTL mice were generated by breeding IL-10 -/-BALB/c mice with P1CTL mice. All mice were maintained in the animal facilities of The Ohio State University that are fully accredited by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care.\n\nT cell culture 0.3 \u00d7 10 6 /ml of spleen and lymph node cells from P1CTL or IL-10 -/-P1CTL mice were cultured in click's EHAA medium (Invitrogen) containing 100 \u03bcg/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ ml streptomycin, 1 mM 2-ME, 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 0.2 \u03bcg/ml P1A35-43 peptide in the absence or presence of 50 ng/ml recombinant mouse IL-27 (Biolegend) for up to 5 days. The culture supernatants and activated P1CTL cells were analyzed during the course of culture.\n\nQuantitative real-time PCR was performed using previously determined conditions [31] . The relative amount of mRNA was calculated by plotting the Ct (cycle number) and the average relative expression for each group was determined using the comparative method (2 -\u0394\u0394Ct ). . Staining procedures for cell surface markers and intracellular cytokines in lymphocytes were as described previously [20] [21] . Staining for AnnexinV/7-AAD was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD Biosciences). Stained cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and data were analyzed using Flowjo software (Tree Star, Inc., OR).\n\nELISA kits for the detection of IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 were purchased from eBiosciences. Standard procedures were followed to detect releases of cytokines in culture supernatants in a variety of settings.\n\nA flow cytometry-based cytotoxicity assay was used to measure in vitro cellular cytotoxicity of IL-27-stimulated WT and IL-10 -/-P1CTL cells to P815 target cells as previously described [42] .\n\nP1CTL cells were stimulated with P1A35-43 in the presence or absence of IL-27 for 4 days. Whole-cell lysates from 3\u00d710 6 cells were run on an SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, blotted using rabbit anti-pSTAT3 (sc-8001-R, Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-Bcl-2 (#2876, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-Bcl-xl (#2764, cell signaling), rabbit anti-Bcl-6 (# 5650s, cell signaling), rabbit anti-SOCS3 (#2932s, cell signaling) and rabbit anticleaved caspase-3 Ab (#9661, Cell Signaling), and detected using an HRP-conjugated antirabbit IgG (Santa Cruz).\n\nMouse plasmacytoma J558 cells (H-2L d ) have been described [43] . To generate J558-IL-27 cells, an IL-27 expression vector (Invivogen) was used together with a pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) expression vector containing hygromycin-resistance gene to transfect J558 cells. The resulting hygromycin-resistant cells were selected for IL-27 secretion by ELISA. A pcDNA3 expression vector containing hygromycin-resistance gene alone was used to transfect J558 cells to generate J558-Ctrl cells simultaneously. The generated J558-IL-27 or J558-Ctrl cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 100 \u03bcg/ ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin, and 5% FBS.\n\nTo establish tumors in mice, 5\u00d710 6 J558-IL-27 or J558-Ctrl cells were subcutaneously (s.c.) inoculated into the flank of recipient mice. The length and width of each tumor was measured using a digital caliper every 2 or 3 days. The tumor volume was calculated according to the formula V = ab 2 /2, as described [20] [21] .\n\nTo treat mice with established J558 tumors, 1\u00d710 7 splenocytes from P1CTL-transgenic mice or 5\u00d710 6 in vitro-activated P1CTLs were injected into tumor-bearing mice i.v.\n\nCD8 + T cells from P1CTL mice were labeled with CFSE and were injected into Rag-2 -/mice i.v. at a dose of 5 \u00d7 10 6 cells/mouse. Immediately after T-cell injection, each recipient mouse also received 10 \u00d7 10 6 J558-IL-27 or J558-Ctrl cells. 65 h later, mice were sacrificed and splenocytes were stained for CD8/V\u03b18.3 and analyzed by flow cytometry.\n\nTo deplete CD8 + T cells in vivo, mice received i.p. injection of 250 \u03bcg rat anti-mouse CD8 IgG (53-6.72, BioXcell) diluted in 200 \u03bcl PBS. Control animals received i.p. injection of 250 \u03bcg IgG2a isotype control mAb (2A3, BioXcell). Antibody injection was repeated every 4 days for a total of 3 times to maintain the depletion. To deplete NK cells in Rag1 -/-ebi3 -/mice, 250 \u03bcg anti-mouse NK1.1 IgG (PK136, BioXcell) diluted in 200 \u03bcl PBS was injected into each mouse i.p. weekly.\n\nData are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD/SEM. Two-tailed Student's t-test was used for statistical analysis. p<0.05 was considered significant. "}
