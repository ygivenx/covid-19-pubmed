{"title": "The prevention and eradication of smallpox: a commentary on Sloane (1755) \u2018An account of inoculation\u2019", "body": "Immunization against infectious diseases has protected more children and adults from untimely deaths than any other form of treatment, and smallpox was the first illness to be prevented in this way. When Sir Hans Sloane gave his account of inoculation in 1736 [1], the concepts of contagion and immunity to re-infection were already well understood, although it would take another 150 years before the germ theory of infectious disease led to the identification of specific pathogens by Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch. Reports in the Philosophical Transactions played a leading role in establishing the efficacy and relative safety of inoculation against smallpox.\n\nSir Hans Sloane (1660\u20131753) (figure 1) was a polymath with an extraordinary range of interests even for a man of the Enlightenment [2]. He became personal physician to the families of three British monarchs, Queen Anne, George I and George II, a man of public affairs and a philanthropist. Born into an Irish Protestant family in the year that the Royal Society was founded, Sloane studied medicine and took a great interest in natural history, being elected a Fellow of the Royal Society at the age of 25. Although he had already established a medical practice in London, he leapt at the opportunity to accompany the Duke of Albemarle as family physician when Albemarle was appointed Governor of Jamaica in 1687. Sloane collected numerous botanical specimens and kept a detailed account of his observations on the natural history and people of the Caribbean islands during his 15 months' sojourn there, which he later published in two volumes of exemplary natural history. He disliked the bitter cocoa beans of the New World and advocated the use of a concoction of cocoa, sugar and milk, which we know as chocolate, mostly as a medicinal beverage. In 1719, he became President of the Royal Society of Physicians London. He was also appointed physician-general to the army in 1722. He served as Secretary to the Royal Society (1693\u20131713) when he had editorial responsibility for Philosophical Transactions [3], and in 1727, he succeeded Sir Isaac Newton as President of the Society, stepping down from that post 13 years later at the age of 80.\n\n\nToday, Sloane is best remembered as the founder of the British Museum. He was an avid collector of human artefacts as well as natural history. He left his personal collections to the Crown on the provision that they would be well housed and curated for the benefit of the public, and that his daughters would receive a stipend. Parliament eventually approved this bequest and Sloane's collections became the basis of the British Museum in Bloomsbury and its offshoot, the Natural History Museum in South Kensington. He donated the land on which the Physick Garden stands in Chelsea to the Apothecaries' Society, which still exists as an eighteenth century medical herbarium. The influence of Sir Hans Sloane on this area of London, where he bought the manor of Chelsea, lasts to this day in place names such as Sloane Square and Hans Crescent. As a benefactor, Sloane was a founding supporter of the Foundling Hospital for Children in Bloomsbury, which was established by three notable friends, the merchant seaman Thomas Coram, the composer George Frideric Handel and the artist William Hogarth.\n\nFor a man with such an enquiring mind, Sir Hans published relatively few primary research papers or treatises. Perhaps this was due to his multiple offices and duties. His paper on smallpox describes how he became acquainted in 1721 with the benefits of intradermal inoculation of a small dose of smallpox-infected fluid from a vesicle, and became an advocate of the procedure among the royal family and the medical profession. This paper is just what its title suggests: it is an account or reminiscence of Sloane's introduction of the practice of inoculation and does not really represent a remarkable discovery. Nonetheless, it is full of insights into the disease and an important means to prevention.\n\nSloane states that his \u2018Account of inoculation\u2019 was \u2018given to Mr Ranby, to be published, anno 1736\u2019. In fact, it was not published until 1755, just over a year after Sloane's death. Why Sloane provided this account at this time to John Ranby FRS remains obscure as Ranby was not involved in editing Philosophical Transactions. By 1755 his \u2018co-author\u2019 (the person who communicated the paper to the Royal Society), the Reverend Dr Thomas Birch, was the Secretary of the Society with responsibility for Philosophical Transactions. Birch would have had access to Sloane's papers as he was a founding trustee of the British Museum where the papers were (and are) stored. Sloane's collections of books, antiquities, natural curiosities and manuscripts formed the museum's original collection, including material on Sloane's activities as Secretary and later President of the Royal Society. The reason for the long delay in publication is not clear, but it seems possible that when Birch was sorting through Sloane's papers, he came across this piece and thought that it should finally see light of day.\n\nSloane's paper acknowledges that the successful promulgation of inoculation owed much to two remarkable women. The first was Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (1689\u20131762) (figure 2) who first observed variolation in Turkey and who had her son inoculated there in 1717 and her daughter in England during the 1721 epidemic (box 1). The second was Princess Caroline (1683\u20131737), wife of the future George II, who sought Sloane's advice on whether her own children should be inoculated. Sloane relates that her decision to take this risk followed two successful trials of variolation: the first was on adults in Newgate prison under death sentence who \u2018volunteered\u2019 to be variolated in exchange for their release if they survived, one of whom was sent to have contact with a smallpox patient as a test of protection; the second was on \u2018charity children\u2019, orphans in the parish of St James in London. The ethics of enrolment into clinical trials may have changed since those days but the concept of step by step inquiry from safety to efficacy remains unchanged.\n\n\nSloane writes that he felt unable to recommend firmly to Princess Caroline that her children should be variolated but that on her further questioning, he stated that the consequence of not undergoing the procedure might be much worse. This was a very diplomatic reply so that the Princess had to make the decision herself. She then urged Sloane to speak to the children's grandfather, George I, who condoned it (even though he was barely on speaking terms with the children's father, the Prince of Wales). Inoculating the royal children without ill effect helped to make variolation widely acceptable among the English aristocracy and gentry. The procedure was also introduced in New England [5] (see box 5). In France, however, it was thought to be reckless [6] and Voltaire commented on the difference in attitudes between the two nations with characteristic acuity (box 2).\n\nSmallpox (figure 3a) is a relatively recent disease of humankind [9,10]. Like many epidemic infectious diseases, the causative agent, variola virus (figure 3b), probably crossed over from an animal source after humans attained sufficient population density to sustain the propagation and diversification of the variola virus independently from its original host. It was not until the 1890s that filterable viruses were first distinguished from bacteria that were retained by porous filters. Orthopox viruses, to which variola and vaccinia belong, were first identified as filterable agents by Adelchi Negri's study of vaccinia in 1906 [11]. The story of the rise and fall of smallpox is told by Frank Fenner and the pioneers of eradication [11] as well as several more recent popular books [12\u201315].\n\n\nDepending of the severity of clinical disease, smallpox viruses used to be divided between the most virulent form, Variola major, with a mean case fatality rate of 25\u201330%, and a milder form, Variola minor, with a fatality rate of approximately 15%, but this phenotypic classification only partially correlates with phylogenetic comparisons of virus strains [16]. Many of those who survived showed permanent signs of past infection, such as blindness and pock marks on the skin, but they acquired long-term immunity that rendered them resistant to re-infection. The lack of an animal reservoir, combined with the appearance of obvious signs of infection in all cases, and lack of virus persistence in recovered individuals, permitted the containment and eventual eradication of smallpox as a naturally occurring disease.\n\nAlthough it is thought that the pock marks on the cheeks of the mummified Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses V (approx. 1200 BCE) might represent smallpox, it has not been possible to isolate variola virus DNA from ancient mummified material [17]. The pocks are difficult to distinguish from chickenpox caused by varicella-zoster virus, a type of herpesvirus infection which has co-evolved with hominoids ever since we diverged from the great apes. There are no records of a smallpox-like disease in the Bible or Greco-Roman writings [16]. The first reliable description of smallpox was made in China and dates from the fifth century of the Christian Era (CE) although it may have been present in Asia earlier. The first recorded description of smallpox in Western Europe was made in 581 by the Bishop Gregory of Tours. The Persian physician Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Zakariyya Al-Razi (854\u2013925 CE) [18] wrote a monograph on smallpox and measles (Kitab al-Jadari wa'l-hasba) which is the oldest medical treatise on these two diseases as distinct ailments (interestingly, he considered measles to be the more virulent infection). Al-Razi advocated a way to prevent smallpox affecting the cornea and thereby causing blindness [18]. He wrote: \u2018As soon as the symptoms of smallpox appear, drop rose water into the eyes from time to time, for if the disease be favourable and the pustules few in number, you find that this method of treatment prevents their breaking out in the eyes' (p. 148).\n\nThe proximate animal precursor to variola virus remains uncertain. Phylogenetic analysis of the DNA genome of the virus reveals a close similarity to camelpox virus [19] but also to a poxvirus isolated from the West African rodent, the Tatera gerbil [16,20]. Using forensic DNA and phylogenetic methods, it is often possible to ascertain which host was the original reservoir by determining whether the genetic variability of one species' microbe is nested within a broader diversity of the other's. Thus, it is clear that the pandemic strain of HIV-1 came from chimpanzees in Cameroon [21], whereas for the tubercle bacillus, human Mycobacterium tuberculosis appears to be ancestral to animal strains such as Mycobacterium bovis [22]. While the ancestral orthopox virus for Variola appears to reside in burrowing rodents, insufficient samples of pox virus isolates have been analysed to discern whether both smallpox and camelpox were independently derived from the rodentpox virus, or smallpox from camelpox, or camelpox from smallpox. If camelpox was the immediate precursor to smallpox, this situation has parallels to the current outbreak in humans of the coronavirus causing Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Serological and genome studies indicate that a virus closely related to MERS is widespread among domestic dromedaries; fortunately, human cases thus far represent either a primary zoonosis or nosocomial infections directly related to the zoonosis [23].\n\nSince the severe epidemic form of smallpox (Variola major) was first recorded in East Asia, it is likely to have originated there around 1700 years ago. It is curious that no further field investigations of rodent variola-like viruses have been made since the African gerbil virus was isolated 40 years ago. We therefore propose that it would be informative to characterize pox viruses of gerbil and marmot species indigenous to Mongolia, the Gobi desert and the central Asian steppe. These are the same species, incidentally, that gave rise to the Black Death clades of the plague bacillus Yersinia pestis in the fourteenth century; indeed, Variola major may have migrated westwards along the same silk route 1000 years earlier. We further propose that several independent cross-species introductions of smallpox may have occurred, as seen for HIV in the twentieth century [21]. Thus, the two major clades of Variola minor [16,20] may have separate African origins, and Variola major an Asian one.\n\nThe virulence of infections can change greatly upon cross-species infection as is well recognized for another pox virus, myxoma virus; it causes mild symptoms in its original reservoir species, the South American cotton-tail rabbit, but became a highly lethal, epizootic infection in the European rabbit, both in Europe and Australia [24]. In evolutionary terms, smallpox can be considered to be a recent human infection which remains highly virulent.\n\nWhatever be its origin, Variola major became an exclusively human virus, unlike the cowpox group of viruses which has a broad host range. Smallpox emerged as a major scourge of humankind, spreading all over the inhabited world. As late as 1967, when the World Health Organization (WHO) initiated the Intensified Smallpox Eradication Campaign, the annual number of smallpox cases was estimated to be between 10 and 16 million, with 2.6 million deaths across 31 countries [11]. During the past 500 years, the impact of smallpox was particularly severe when it reached naive populations. For instance, pre-Columbian New World peoples had never experienced smallpox because their ancestors crossed the Bering Strait before it emerged in humans. The high mortality observed in the first American epidemics, authentic examples of \u2018virgin soil epidemics\u2019, could have been exacerbated by the genetic constitution of the affected population which limited their capacity to establish appropriate immunological responses to the newly introduced pathogens [25]. Hernan Cortes and his band of adventurers would not have succeeded in overcoming the mighty Aztec Empire in 1521 without the epidemic of smallpox which they unwittingly released into the capital city, Tenochtitlan, the previous year, as told in the chronicles of the conquistador Bernal Diaz del Castillo [26]. Without the devastating effect of smallpox [27] and other viral diseases such as measles, there would not have been an estimated 85\u201390% fall in the population of indigenous Americans during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries [28], and therefore little impetus to establish the trans-Atlantic slave trade [9].\n\nThe lesson of smallpox in the Spanish colonization of Mexico was not lost on Francisco Pizzaro during his coup against the Incas a few years later. Moreover, in eighteenth century North America, the redcoat Colonel Henry Bouquet sent his commander, General Lord Jeffrey Amherst, a request \u2018to inocculate the Indians' by sending smallpox-impregnated blankets to the Native Americans, who, under the leadership of Chief Pontiac, were besieging Fort Pitt (Pittsburgh). In a postscript to his reply on 16 July 1763, Amherst approved this request and added that Bouquet should also \u2018try every other method that can serve to extirpate this execrable race\u2019. Continuing concern over the possibility of utilizing smallpox for germ warfare influences the current debate whether to destroy the remaining stocks of the virus officially stored in the former Soviet Union and USA after its eradication as a naturally occurring infection. In 1996, on the 200th anniversary of Jenner's experiment into vaccination, the WHO voted to destroy variola, but this deliberate extinction of a species has yet to be carried out and may be indefinitely delayed [29].\n\nThe protection against smallpox by administration of small doses of infected material was called engrafting, inoculation or variolation (varus is Latin for pimple). Different forms of variolation had been used for centuries in China and the practice also became widespread throughout the Ottoman Empire and the Arab world [30]. Philosophical Transactions published several articles on variolation around the time of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's campaign. A paper in Latin by Emanuele Timoni FRS was read to the Royal Society in January 1721 about the procedure which he witnessed during the 1714 smallpox outbreak in Constantinople, and Jacob Pylarini discussed the 1716 outbreak in Smyrna (Izmir) as cited by Sloane.\n\nNoah Moxham, the archivist studying Philosophical Transactions, has written an interesting blog [31] on how James Jurin, the editor during the 1720s, promoted investigation of variolation in the journal. Jurin's own 1722 paper [32] was a particularly important contribution because he included statistical estimates and tables on the respective mortality rates for inoculation versus natural smallpox infection. Voltaire may have based his commentary on Jurin's paper (box 2).\n\nAnother fascinating account in Philosophical Transactions [33] translated from Arabic comes from His Excellency the Ambassador to England from Tripoli, Cassem Aga FRS, on how he and his seven siblings were inoculated as children. He adds: \u2018The practice is so innocent and so sure that out of an hundred persons inoculated not two die, whereas on the contrary out of an hundred persons that are infected in the natural way there die commonly about thirty. It is withal so ancient in the kingdoms of Tripoly, Tunis and Algier, that nobody remembers its first rise, and it is practiced not only by the inhabitants of the towns, but also by the wild Arabs' [nomads]. Inoculation was also practised in sub-Saharan Africa at this time (see box 5).\n\nUsing live pathogenic virus for variolation certainly did carry a risk, and about 2% of those inoculated developed severe smallpox and died (but with refinement of the practice the risk was reduced to around 0.3%). Some newspapers exaggerated accounts of deaths from inoculation. However, in one household, six servants contracted smallpox not long after a child had been inoculated; whether it had spread from the inoculum (which was a real possibility) or was actually a result of natural infection is a moot point since the inoculation took place in the face of an epidemic. Therefore, it was recommended that inoculated individuals should undergo a preparation procedure and be isolated during the vesicular period to avoid starting an outbreak among contacts. Later, vaccination removed these risks, but variolation was preferable to catching natural smallpox, with its much higher mortality and survivors often left pock-marked or blind. However, many physicians resisted the new technique, and some clergymen declared that taking measures to prevent smallpox was acting against God's will.\n\nSloane [1] also considered familial susceptibility to severe disease in mentioning the one nearly fatal consequence of variolation under his care, that of the son of the Duke of Bridgewater. He noted that many members of this family had died of natural smallpox before the Duke's son was variolated, but that his daughter who received a similar dose of the same incoculum survived without ill effect.\n\nThe greatest advance in the prevention of smallpox was surely Edward Jenner's demonstration that inoculation of cowpox protected against smallpox [34]. He called the procedure vaccine inoculation (\u2018vacca\u2019, is Latin for cow); Richard Dunning, a surgeon in Plymouth, coined the term vaccination in 1803 [35]. Cowpox can cause a mild disease in humans, who soon recover.\n\nAfter documenting a number of cases in which previous natural infection by cowpox protected against smallpox (or against successful variolation), on 14 May 1796, Jenner proceeded to vaccinate an eight year old boy named James Phipps. Six weeks later, variolation of the child was attempted without any evidence of infection, providing the first experimental evidence that cowpox elicits immunity to smallpox. At that point, Jenner prepared a communication for the Royal Society, but it was not accepted for publication (box 3). Jenner had to wait two years for new cases of cowpox, to conduct additional experimental inoculations. However, Jenner did not want to risk a new rejection from the Royal Society and privately published his observations in his famous \u2018Inquiry\u2019 [34].\n\nAlthough the protective effective of natural cowpox infection among milkmaids appears to have been known, Jenner was the first to conduct the clinical investigations to provide scientific evidence for unproven folk knowledge (box 4). But the genius of Jenner was not only to provide experimental evidence of the efficacy of vaccination, but also to envisage that this new procedure would eventually eradicate smallpox. As early as 1801 he predicted that \u2018The annihilation of the Small Pox, the most dreadful scourge of the human species, must be the final result of this practice\u2019 [41].\n\nVaccination became rapidly adopted worldwide (see box 5 on its early uptake in Massachusetts), and it soon became mandatory in many countries. In the second half of the twentieth century, with the roll-out of vaccination coverage to resource-poor countries, smallpox eventually became confined to two regions of the world, the Horn of Africa and the India\u2013Bangladesh border. As mentioned before, the WHO initiated its Intensified Smallpox Eradication Campaign in 1967 under the inspired leadership of D. A. Henderson, and the last case of naturally occurring smallpox was recorded in Somalia only 10 years later [11,13].\n\nThe real nature of the smallpox vaccine, which we call vaccinia virus, remains a puzzle to this day. For many years it was assumed to be cowpox, but in the mid-twentieth century it became clear that vaccinia stocks were biologically different from cowpox virus [43]. In fact, both cowpox and horsepox were used during the nineteenth century to vaccinate (or \u2018equinate\u2019!) against smallpox, and some strains of vaccinia may be derived from horsepox, or from a recombinant with horsepox genes [44,45]. Jenner himself speculated that \u2018the preservative of smallpox\u2019 (as he called the vaccine) may have derived from a disease of horses, as modified by its passage through the cow [34]. There also appear to be multiple origins of \u2018cowpox\u2019 [46], which probably have reservoirs in rodents that sporadically infect other mammals including, in Jenner's time, cows.\n\nIn the early days, preserving vaccine stocks was a problem and finding new cases of cowpox became increasingly rare. Vaccinia started to be maintained by sequential inoculation of children from arm to arm. However, the virus often disappeared or lost its potency. After 1864, retro-vaccination of calves provided a more reliable source of vaccinia, a practice that was initiated in Naples and extended around the world.\n\nThere remains concern that smallpox could be revived by rescue of virus from remains of victims preserved in coffins or in the permafrost [17,47], or by malicious means from unrecorded virus stocks, although rapid vaccination should be able to contain an outbreak. Vaccination itself can cause serious disease in immunocompromised people. Therefore, ongoing research is seeking to further attenuate the current \u2018modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA)\u2019 while maintaining its immunogenic properties. Furthermore, MVA is also being exploited as a live vector to deliver genes for immunogens of other infectious diseases [48].\n\nWith the development of the germ theory of disease in the second half of the nineteenth century, a large number of specific microorganisms were identified in the aetiology of different infectious diseases, and attempts were made to develop immunization against those diseases. In 1881, Louis Pasteur presented his work on the use of attenuated microorganisms to protect against two animal diseases (chicken cholera and anthrax) at the 7th International Congress of Medicine in London. In that meeting, and to honour Jenner, Pasteur proposed to generalize the term \u2018vaccination\u2019 to all protective immunization procedures. In 1885, almost 90 years after the development of vaccination against smallpox, Louis Pasteur and \u00c9mile Roux described the second human vaccine, against rabies, although this was an inactivated vaccine rather than an attenuated one [49].\n\nToday, two further virus infections have been eradicated globally through immunization: polio type 2 in 1999 [50] and rinderpest of cattle in 2011 [51]. Thanks to two different vaccines developed in the 1950s and 1960s, the killed vaccine by Jonas Salk and the live attenuated one by Albert Sabin, we are close to eradicating polio [50]. However, an anti-vaccine scare by a radical mullah in Nigeria [52] set back the eradication in West Africa by 10 years and allowed the same strain of polio virus to migrate to Indonesia, probably via the Haj. The use of \u2018vaccinators' as a US cover for tracking down Osama bin Laden in Pakistan [53] has also hindered the polio endgame, including the tragic assassination of genuine public health vaccine workers in Pakistan in 2012 and again in 2014.\n\nVaccines are considered to be the most cost-effective public health interventions and it is estimated that between 2 and 3 million children in developing countries are spared from death every year [54]. In the 1990s, six vaccines were included in routine paediatric immunization programmes in many countries, and that number has increased to sixteen today. But we recognize that the full impact of vaccination has not been achieved, and major efforts are being made to develop vaccines against other diseases [55,56]. Equally important is the ongoing effort to make those vaccines available to all people of need around the world [54]. However, the development of preventive vaccines against the three largest infectious killer diseases (HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis) remains a challenge that will require a committed and continued effort towards the development of new scientific paradigms [57,58].\n\nSince Jenner, the development of vaccines has been based on the re-creation of the protective immunity that results after natural infections. Novel vaccines against persistent infections may have to be \u2018better than nature\u2019, inducing the unnatural immune responses that nature has not learned to produce [56]. The power of vaccines is also being applied not only to prevent but also to treat diseases, such as cancer [59] and AIDS [60]. Moreover, vaccination is being explored as a measure to prevent non-infectious conditions, such as heroin and tobacco addictions [61]. The legacy of Jenner has extended beyond his wildest dreams!\n\nA discussion on variolation and vaccination would not be complete without some comments on ethics. Every medical intervention implies the need for a risk\u2013benefit assessment and the prevention of smallpox provides a good example. Although vilified by some, variolation could be justified on the terms of a more damaging alternative, namely to suffer the disease. Despite the inherent value of variolation, modern vaccinologists often consider variolation only as a procedure that facilitated the introduction of vaccination. However, variolation and vaccination coexisted in the UK until at least 1840, when variolation was outlawed by the Vaccination Act of that year. More controversial at that time was the Vaccination Act of 1853 that instituted compulsory vaccination. That decision led to movements that opposed vaccination, which on several occasions resulted in violent demonstrations [62]. Alfred Russel Wallace, who postulated evolution by natural selection independently of Charles Darwin, was deeply opposed to compulsory vaccination [63]. Eventually, in 1898, a new UK law was passed which permitted conscientious objectors [64].\n\nEarly developments in testing immunization procedures may appear high-handed by modern standards, such as the variolation of prisoners and of orphan children described in Sloane's paper. The \u2018experiment\u2019 conducted in 1796 by Jenner, by vaccinating and then variolating an 8 year old child may seem at first sight unethical today. However, children stood to benefit the most from vaccination and the challenge with smallpox \u2018material\u2019 (variolation) was in fact the \u2018gold\u2019 standard of smallpox prevention at that time [65].\n\nNonetheless, there continues to be a dilemma between the huge benefit of herd immunity for the population at large and the occasional deleterious side effect of vaccination in the rare individual, a matter of concern and liability for the pharmaceutical companies that produce vaccines. Moreover, there is still a sizeable anti-vaccination movement today [62]. The 0.3% mortality from variolation in Sloane's time was considered to be worth the risk, and the seriously adverse side effects of modern vaccines are far fewer; yet we recently witnessed how the entirely spurious scare of autism resulting from measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) combined vaccine led so many parents to avoid protecting their children. Thus, we applaud Sloane's sentiment [1] that it is a matter of wonder \u2018that this operation which seems so plainly for the public good, should, through dread of the distempers being inculcated with it, and other unreasonable prejudices, be stopped from procuring it\u2019."}
