{"title": "Protective Effects of Long Pentraxin PTX3 on Lung Injury in a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Model in Mice", "body": "acute lung injury; inflammatory response; neutrophil infiltration; pulmonary viral infection; transgenic mice Viral infections are the most common cause of respiratory infectious diseases, such as the common cold and seasonal influenza. In certain circumstances, airway viral infections lead to severe lung injury and become life-threatening diseases, especially in patients at the extremes of age (<6 and >60) or with pre-existing medical conditions (1, 2) . In 2003, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a coronavirus resulted in approximately 8,000 cases with over 700 deaths globally (3) . The potential for global viral pandemics was further illustrated by the outbreak of H5N1 influenza (avian flu) in 2008 and H1N1 influenza (swine flu) in 2009, with severe morbidity and mortality, as well as high economic costs (1) . Although a number of studies in both animal models of SARS (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) and in patients with SARS (9) have been published, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection have not been fully elucidated.\n\nSARS-CoV is the causative agent of SARS (3, 10) . Biologically, SARS-CoV is most closely related to Group 2 coronaviruses, including murine hepatitis viruses (MHV) (10) . We have shown that airway infection of MHV-1 leads to acute lung injury in susceptible strains of mice, the patterns of which are very similar to the damage observed in the lung of SARS patients (4) . Thus, pulmonary MHV-1 infection in mice may serve as a clinically relevant model for determining the molecular mechanisms of SARS as well as testing potential therapeutics against it (11) .\n\nLong pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is an important inflammatory mediator and a critical component of the humoral arm of innate immunity (12, 13) . PTX3 expression levels remain very low in tissues and serum of normal subjects, and quickly elevate upon inflammatory and/or infectious stimuli (14) (15) (16) . PTX3 plays a non-redundant role in the immune response to fungi and certain bacterial infections, with potential therapeutic effects in experimental infections (17, 18) . The serum level of PTX3 is elevated in severe dengue infection (19) . PTX3 can bind to human and murine cytomegalovirus (CMV), and inhibit viral infectivity in vitro and protect mice from CMV primary infection and reactivation in vivo (20) . Similarly, selective binding between PTX3 and certain strains of influenza viruses have been reported. PTX3 treatment attenuated virulence in vitro and in vivo, and showed potential therapeutic effects by reducing the virus load and enhancing the survival of infected animals (21) . Smits et al., found that PTX3, among other genes, such as VCAM1, F3 and IL-8, was significantly increased after SARS-CoV infection in aged macaques (22) .\n\nWe hypothesized that PTX3 may play a protective role in pulmonary coronavirus infection by involving in host defense and regulating inflammatory responses in the lung. We used MHV-1 to examine the PTX3 response to the viral infection, compared the susceptibility of PTX3 deficient mice to their wild type littermates, and evaluated the potential therapeutic effects of exogenous PTX3.\n\nPTX3-KO mice and their wild type littermates (WT) were generated by breeding ptx3+/\u2212 heterozygous (129/SvEv/C57BL6/J background from Dr. M. M. Matzuk, Baylor College of Medicine) (23) . Mice were genotyped by PCR with two pairs of primers designed against murine PTX3 Exon 2 and human HPRT contained in the targeting vector ( Fig 1A) (23) . The specificity of PCR genotyping (Fig 1B) was validated by Southern blot (Fig 1C) . All animals used were 8-12 weeks-old, housed in a pathogen-free facility and received humane care in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals formulated by the Canadian Council on Animal Care. The Animal Use and Care Committee of the University Health Network Toronto General Research Institute approved this study.\n\nMHV-1 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Viruses were first plaque purified and then expanded in murine 17CL1 cells. Supernatants were collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0C (4). Recombinant PTX3 (a gift from Dr. Giovanni Salvatori, Sigma-Tau SpA, Rome, Italy) was obtained under endotoxin-free conditions by immunoaffinity purification of culture supernatants of Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with PTX3 ( 24) .\n\nPTX3-KO and -WT mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with 0.2 ml 10% pentobarbital diluted in normal saline, and received an intranasal inoculation of MHV-1 (either 5,000 or 10,000 PFU) in 50 \u03bcl ice-cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), or same volume of DMEM as mock infection controls. Symptoms including ruffled fur, tremors, and lack of activity were monitored daily (4). To assess lung injury, mice were sacrificed at day 1, 2, 4, 8, and 14 post-infection with 4-6 PTX3-KO or -WT mice at each time point. For PTX3 treatment, PTX-KO and -WT mice were infected intranasally with 5,000 PFU of MHV-1 and then immediately treated with either 50 \u03bcl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or recombinant PTX3 (2 mg/kg in PBS) intranasally. The same dose of PTX3 was administrated intraperitoneally to animals at 6 and 24 h postinfection (20, 21) . Mice were sacrificed at day 2 post-infection (4 mice/group). Blood was collected by cardiac puncture, and serum was isolated and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. The left lung was fixed for histological and immunohistochemical studies. The remaining lung tissue was snap-frozen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for virus titer and cytokine analysis.\n\nAn aliquot of lung tissue from each animal was homogenized in 10% ice-cold DMEM utilizing a Polytron homogenizer (Fisher Scientific, Whitby, Canada). Viral titers were determined in L2 cells as described previously (25) .\n\nThe left lungs were inflated at 20 cmH 2 O, fixed with 4% parafolmaldehyde in PBS, and embedded in paraffin. Lung sections (5 \u03bcm) were stained for different assessments. Lung injury was assessed with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. A modified lung injury score system was utilized (26) . PTX3 was stained with a polyclonal anti-PTX3 antibody (H-300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) (27) . Infiltrating inflammatory cells in the lung tissues were characterized using a standard avidin-biotin complex immunoperoxidase method. Neutrophil influx was stained using a rat anti-mouse neutrophil monoclonal antibody (Serotec, Raleigh, NC). A rat anti-mouse F4/80 antigen monoclonal antibody (Serotec) was used for staining of macrophages (4). The slides were scanned with a ScanScope, and quantitative analysis of positive pixels/mm 2 for each slide was done with a Positive Pixel Count Algorithm program (Aperio, Vista, CA). The staining intensities were expressed as ratios to one experimental group within the same batch of staining.\n\nPTX3 levels in lung homogenates and serum were determined in duplicate with an ELISA kit (R&D System, Minneapolis, MN) (28) .\n\nCytokines and chemokines in the lung homogenates and serum were measured using a mouse cytometric bead array inflammation kit (BD Bioscience, Mississauga, Canada) (29) .\n\nPlates were coated overnight at room temperature with MHV-1 or MHV-3 viruses at different PFUs in PBS. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS. The coating quality was determined with an anti-spike monoclonal antibody, which recognizes the spike protein of both MHV-1 and MHV-3. An isotype specific IgG was used as a negative control. PTX3-viral binding assay was performed by incubating the viral coated wells with biotin-labeled PTX3 (Bio-PTX3, a gift from Dr. Barbara Bottazzi in Istituto Clinico Humanitas -IRCCS, Milano, Italy) for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. Inhibition was performed by pre-incubation with unbiotinylated PTX3 for 2 h at 37\u00b0C prior to the addition of Bio-PTX3. The optical density (O.D.) at 450 nm was read using the Horseradish Peroxidase Substrate Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Life Science Group, Segrate, Italy). Nonspecific binding of PTX3 to virus-uncoated plates was minimal ( 20, 21) .\n\nMHV-1 viruses were mixed with different concentrations of PTX3, cell culture medium as a negative control, or anti-viral serum against MHV-1 (1:40 dilution) as a positive control, at room temperature for 30 min. The mixture was then added to sub-confluent L2 cells in culture medium for 1 h, overlaid with 2% agarose, and incubated at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO 2 environment for 72 h. The effect of PTX3 on viral replication was assessed by counting viral plaques (30) .\n\nData are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). Inter-group differences were tested by one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and followed by post hoc multiple comparison Tukey's test. The differences between two groups were tested with a student t test. P values <0.05 are defined as significant.\n\nTo test cytokine expression in response to pulmonary MHV-1 infection, wild type mice were infected by intranasal instillation of 5,000 or 10,000 PFU of MHV-1, respectively. MHV-1 infection led to a rapid increase of PTX3 protein expression in the lung at higher levels, which reached a peak at day 4, and then were reduced at day 8 (Fig 2A) . The PTX3 levels in the serum also increased and remained elevated at day 8 ( Fig 2B) . The higher dose of MHV-1 (10,000 PFU) induced higher PTX3 expression in the lung at day 4 and day 8 (p<0.05, Fig 2A) . Endothelial cells, alveolar epithelial cells (especially type II like cells), and infiltrated cells in the alveolar wall were positively stained with anti-PTX3 antibodies at day 1, day 2 and day 4 after viral infection. An example of day 2 image was shown in Fig  2C. At day 8, the PTX3 staining was reduced significantly (data not shown). PTX3 was found neither in the lung nor in the serum in PTX3 deficient mice.\n\nInoculation of MHV-1 (5,000 PFU) induced lung inflammation and injury in both PTX3-KO mice and their wild type littermates. The early stage post-infection (day 2) was characterized histologically by patchy peribronchial and perivascular mixed inflammatory infiltrates associated with interstitial thickening and congestion. This progressed over the next several days (days 4-8) to more widespread and severe peribronchial and alveolar septal inflammatory infiltrates associated with areas of intra-alveolar exudation and hemorrhage, then subsided by day 14 to predominantly peribronchial inflammatory lesions containing mononuclear cell infiltrates, associated with foamy macrophages in the surrounding airspaces (Fig 3) . More severe injury was apparent in the lungs of PTX3-KO mice than PTX3-WT mice in the earlier stages of infection (days 2 and 4), but not in later stages (days 8 and 14) (Fig 3B) . No obvious lung injury was observed in mock-infected lungs in both PTX3-KO and -WT mice.\n\nWe performed immunohistochemical staining for neutrophils and macrophages in the MHV-1 infected lungs. Neutrophils were found mainly surrounding small bronchi and blood vessels at the early stage (day 1 and 2) after infection, and subsequently shifted more peripherally (Fig 4A and data not shown) . Macrophages at first showed diffuse distribution and then progressively localized peribronchial inflammatory lesions (Fig 5A and data not  shown) . Semi-quantitative analysis revealed that the recruitment of both neutrophils and macrophages in the lung was increased in a time-dependent manner until day 8 post infection. At day 14, staining of neutrophils was reduced, while the staining of macrophages remained high. There was significantly higher positive staining of both neutrophils and macrophages in PTX3-KO mouse lungs compared to the PTX3-WT group at day 1 and day 2 post-infection (Fig 4B and 5B ).\n\nWe first determined the interaction between PTX3 and MHV-1. An anti-spike monoclonal antibody recognized the spikeglyco protein on both MHV-1 and MHV-3 ( Fig 6A) . Incubation of biotin-labeled PTX3 (Bio-PTX3, 5 \u03bcg/ml) with the immobilized viruses showed increased binding to either MHV-1 or MHV-3 in a viral dose-dependent manner ( Fig  6B) . PTX3 reduced MHV-1 infectivity dose-dependently in cell culture (Fig 6C) .\n\nWe then assessed whether recombinant PTX3 has protective effects on MHV-1 induced lung injury in vivo. We first treated MHV-1 infected PTX3-KO and -WT mice with recombinant PTX3 or PBS as a vehicle control. Mice were sacrificed 2 days after MHV-1 infection. Administration of PTX3 accelerated viral clearance from the infected lungs in both PTX3-KO and -WT mice (Fig 6D, P<0 .05), attenuated MHV-1 induced lung injury in both PTX3-KO and -WT mice (Fig 6E) , and significantly reduced the lung injury score in PTX3-KO mice (Fig 6F, P<0 .05).PTX3 alone ha d no effects on lung histology of mock-infected mice.\n\nAdministration of PTX3 significantly blocked neutrophil infiltration in the lungs in both PTX-WT and -KO mice (Fig 7A) . In contrast, PTX3 treatment further promoted pulmonary infiltration of macrophages in the PTX3-KO mice (Fig 7B) . PTX3 treatment significantly reduced the expression of IL-6, MCP-1 and MIP-1\u03b2 in the lung in the PTX3-KO group ( Fig  7C) . The serum levels of these inflammatory mediators measured were not affected by PTX3 treatment (data not shown).\n\nIn the present study, we have shown that PTX3 deficiency enhanced susceptibility to MHV-1 pulmonary infection, and administration of exogenous PTX3 ameliorated lung injury. The innate immunity response is the first line of host defense against viral infection. Proteomic analysis of plasma from SARS patients showed increased acute-phase proteins, such as serum amyloid A and MBL (mannose-binding lectin) (31) . Long pentraxin PTX3, a member of pentraxin super family, is also an acute phase protein and has been defined as a key prototypic component of the humoral arm of innate immunity (12) . PTX3 is of particular interest due to its local expression from a variety of tissues at the site of infection and inflammation (12, 13, 27) . PTX3 plays a critical role in host defense against pulmonary infection caused by fungus (17) , bacteria (18) , CMV and certain strains of influenza viruses (20, 21) .\n\nIn the present study, MHV-1 infection induced a dose dependent increase of PTX3 in the lung in wild type mice and caused more severe lung injury in PTX3 deficient animals. Recombinant PTX3 significantly reduced lung injury in PTX3-KO and littermate WT mice. The reduction of exogenous PTX3 on acute lung injury is more effective in the PTX3-KO mice than in the WT mice. This may be due to the dose used, timing, or route of administration, and does not rule out an effect of PTX3, but it should be further studied. The genetic background of mice in the present study is 129/SvEv/C57BL6/J. We have shown that the severity of acute lung injury induced by airway infection of MHV-1 varies depending upon the strains of mice (4) . The function of PTX3 in different strains of mice thus merits further investigation. This will be clinically relevant because the susceptibility of patients to SARS-CoV also varies. Different strains of mouse-adapted SARS-CoV have been developed by Subbarao's (6) and Barnard's groups (7), respectively. It would be interesting to further test the potential protective effects of PTX3 with these viruses, which may be more directly relevant to SARS.\n\nOne of the important functions of the pentraxin family is pathogen recognition. It has been reported that PTX3 can bind to CMV viruses (20) and to influenza viruses (21) . A dose dependent binding between PTX3 and MHV viruses was found in the present study. PTX3 reduced MHV-1 viral infectivity in cell culture. Exogenous PTX3 enhanced virus clearance from the infected lungs. Since binding of PTX3 was found in two MHV strains (MHV-1 and MHV-3), PTX3 may also bind to other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV, and facilitate their clearance from the infected lungs.\n\nAs an important component of the innate immune system, inflammatory responses are quickly initiated in response to infection of pathogens (e.g. viruses), and function to clear pathogens and damaged tissues, limiting tissue injury, and eventually leading to recovery or tissue healing (32) . PTX3, as an inflammatory mediator, responds to pro-inflammatory stimuli and participates in the regulation of inflammatory responses (13) . The potential roles of PTX3 in acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome have been studied in multiple animal models (33) as well as in humans (16) . The expression level of PTX3 has been suggested as a biomarker to predict the severity of the acute lung injury (28, 34, 35) .\n\nIn the present study, MHV-1 induced expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the lung was reduced by exogenous PTX3 treatment. Furthermore, neutrophil infiltration was enhanced in the lungs of PTX3 deficient mice, which was attenuated by PTX3 treatment. We have shown that PTX3 deficiency also worsens the lung injury induced by lipopolysaccharide (36) . These findings are consistent with a newly defined antiinflammatory role of PTX3 in the recruitment of inflammatory cells, in which PTX3 binds to P-selectin and attenuates neutrophil migration to the sites of inflammation (37) . Therefore, in addition to its effects on viral binding and facilitating viral clearance, it is reasonable to speculate that the regulatory function of PTX3 on inflammatory responses may confer further protective effects in coronavirus-induced lung injury. It has been shown that the severity of pulmonary lesions induced by MHV infection correlated better to the elevated inflammatory responses than to the viral replication in the lung (38) . Therefore, inhibition of inflammatory responses is important in protecting the lung from injury.\n\nMacrophages are abundant in the lower respiratory tract. Alveolar macrophages are key effector cells of the innate immune response to pathogen invasion (39), but may also be able to modulate excessive inflammation and render an immune-suppressive effect in the lung (40) . Unlike neutrophil influx, which decreased one week after MHV-1 infection and was inhibited by PTX3 treatment, macrophage infiltration remained elevated in the lung even at two weeks post MHV-1 infection. PTX3 administration further increased the influx of macrophages in the lungs of PTX3 KO mice. We speculate that macrophages may play an important role in anti-viral immunity, viral clearance and lung tissue repair, although the mechanisms for this effect remains undefined at this time. MCP-1 (CCL2) and MIP-1\u03b2 (CCL4) are chemokines related to monocyte recruitment. Interestingly, both of these chemokines were down-regulated by exogenous PTX treatment in the lung of PTX3 KO mice. It is possible that in PTX3 KO mice, the regulation of macrophages in the lung is altered due to unknown compensatory mechanisms.\n\nCollectively our data revealed that PTX3 plays an important role in host defense against pulmonary coronavirus infection and protects the lung from injury. The beneficial effects of PTX3 treatment in the MHV-1 induced lung injury appear to be secondary to its antiviral activity as well as its ability to mediate the inflammatory response.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.
