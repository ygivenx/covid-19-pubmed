{"title": "Influenza B virus infections in Western Saxony, Germany in three consecutive seasons between 2015 and 2018: Analysis of molecular and clinical features", "body": "Influenza B virus of the Orthomyxoviridae family [1] has a segmented single stranded, negative sense RNA genome. First isolated in 1940, influenza B virus diverged into two lineages, Victoria and Yamagata, in the late 1970s with similar clinical [2] but different phylodynamic properties [3] . Although infections in pigs and seals were observed, there is no known animal reservoir for influenza B [4] . Thus, while influenza A infections can be zoonotic, influenza B virus only circulates in the human population. The narrow host range and slower evolution [5] are thought to be the main contributing factors to the less frequent occurrence of influenza B epidemics [6] .\n\nIn 2017/18 influenza B predominance was reported in countries throughout the northern hemisphere. It was the leading influenza type in Europe and Canada [7] [8] [9] and the second most common type after influenza A/H3N2 in the USA [10] . In Germany, after the seasons of 2001/2, 2005/6 and 2015/16, it was only the fourth season of the 21st century with a dominance of influenza B [11] . As the prevailing lineage of influenza B changes frequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended to include both lineages in a tetravalent vaccine in 2012 [12] .\n\nThe key component of the vaccine is the viral hemagglutinin (HA) that covers the viral surface in a trimeric form. The major antigenic regions are the 120-loop, 150-loop, 160-loop, and 190helix [13] and are located on the HA1 subunit which forms the globular head domain. It is responsible for recognition and binding of sialic acids on the surface of the target cells. The HA2 subunit is the main component of the HA stalk. Although some antibody \n\nVaccine j o u r n a l h o m e p a g e : w w w . e l s e v i e r . c o m / l o c a t e / v a c c i n e cross reactivity is observed [14, 15] , vaccine efficiency between the two lineages might be reduced in seasons in which the formulation of the trivalent influenza vaccine does not match the circulating strain due to antigenic differences [16, 17] . Additionally, there is growing evidence that vaccine effectiveness is already waning within a season thus reducing immunological protection even if the vaccine contained the matching strain in the previous season [18] .\n\nThe aim of this study was to analyze clinical and molecular features of laboratory-confirmed influenza B cases during three consecutive seasons between 2015 and 2018. A comparison between patient characteristics was done in relation to the combined seasons of 2015/16 and 2016/17 when appropriate. Additionally, molecular epidemiology of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) gene was performed on selected isolates and amino acid changes were mapped to the major antigenic domains of the HA protein.\n\nSpecimens and clinical data. 11,956 respiratory samples, including nasal aspirates, supernatants from nasal and pharyngeal swabs, throat rinsing fluid, tracheal secretions, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, of 7681 patients were tested for respiratory virus infections. Testing was initiated at the discretion of the Lineage determination. NA sequences of a 123 bp-long amplicon of the HA gene [19] were assessed (BigDye Terminator Sequencing Kit v1.1 and ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA). The sequenced region corresponds to nucleotide positions 966-1088 and 963-1085 of the complete HA gene of the Victoria lineage (B/Brisbane/60/2008) and the Yamagata lineage (B/Phuket/3073/2013), respectively. Sequences with nucleotides G16, G17, G28, G55, C64, G73, and A112 belonged to the Victoria-lineage. Viruses with nucleotides A16, A17, A28, A55, T64, T73, and G112 belonged to the Yamagata-lineage.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis. NA sequencing of the complete HA was performed according to WHO guidance [20] . In cases of low influenza B concentration an alternative protocol generating three instead of two overlapping fragments was used [21] . Phylogenetic trees of the 1710 nucleotides large HA coding region were constructed at nucleotide level with the MEGA software version 6 using the Maximum-Likelihood method. Bootstrap analysis was performed with 1000 replicates [22] . Complete HA sequences were submitted to Genbank (accession numbers MK459565 -MK459656).\n\nStatistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 24.0 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). Continuous values were expressed as mean or median (range) and categorical data as frequencies (percentages). Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test was performed to compare means. Chi-square or Fisher's exact test were performed for categorical variables. All tests were two-tailed. A p-level of < 0.05 was considered significant.\n\nRelative and absolute numbers of influenza types detected between 2015 and 2018 are shown in Table 1 . For season 2015/16 the maximum number of cases occurred between weeks 10 and 14 of 2016. The peak occurrence in patients below 18 years was in week 12 while it was week 14 for the adult patients (Fig. 1A) . The eleven cases of the season of 2016/17 occurred Table 2 Study population and clinical features of influenza B infected cases. (Table 2) . For the pediatric patients there were no significant differences between season 2017/18 and 2015-2017 except for the combined rate of comorbidities and risk factors for a severe course of the influenza. However, this could not be attributed to a single analyzed factor. When looking at the adult population, there were no significant differences between season 2017/18 and the previous seasons except for a higher proportion of female patients and a lower proportion of viral coinfections in 2017/18. Most differences were noted between the age groups. 32.3% of the adult patients were vaccinated, mostly with the trivalent vaccine, whereas 95.5% of the pediatric patients were unvaccinated. The rate of comorbidities was significantly higher in the adult population. Furthermore, the clinical course of the disease was more severe in the adult population as higher rates of ICU admissions, invasive ventilation, and fatal outcomes were observed. HA phylogeny. Sequence analysis of the whole hemagglutinin gene was performed for 16 Victoria and 76 Yamagata strains and consistently confirmed the results of the initial lineage determination. Included were all strains of patients with a known trivalent (n = 33) or tetravalent (n = 7) vaccination, randomly selected patients without known vaccination (n = 51), and of all patients that had a fatal outcome within 30 days of the influenza B detection (n = 27). Except for one strain of 2017, all Victoria strains originated from the 2015/2016 season and belonged to the 1A clade. All of the strains were phylogenetically closely related and did not cluster based on vaccination history or fatal outcome (Fig. 3A) . All analyzed Yamagata strains belonged to clade 3. All of the strains were phylogenetically closely related, but strain phylogeny indicates a discrete drift from season 2015/16 to season 2017/18. Again, no clustering with regard to vaccination history or fatal outcome was observed (Fig. 3B) .\n\nAmino acid changes. The detected amino acid changes (AAchanges) within the HA protein are depicted in Table 3 \n\nThe influenza season of 2017/18 was dominated by the Yamagata-lineage of influenza B in Europe. In Germany, it was the largest season in terms of case numbers since the establishment of the nationwide surveillance system in 2001 [11] . Large scale epidemics or pandemics are usually caused by influenza A. This is attributed mostly to the broader host range and faster rate of evolution of influenza A [6] . Influenza B infections usually occur with a temporal delay towards the end of an influenza Adominated season [23] . The exceptional impact of influenza B infections in 2017/18 with regard to public health was therefore surprising. However, seasons with a high proportion of influenza B infections occur infrequently. Specifically, in Germany, the mild seasons of 2001/2 and 2005/6 and the severe season of 2015/16 have been dominated by influenza B with a share of up to 78% of all influenza cases. The high severity of the season 2017/18 with an overall estimate of 9 million excess consultations in Germany [11] may be attributed to several factors.\n\nAccording to the ECDC, the influenza season of 2017/18 started earlier than most of previous ones [9] . While this is true for the epidemic phase of the two influenza B heavy seasons in this study, the time frame for isolated cases was comparable. In the season of 2015/16 the epidemic phase started in week 5 of 2016 and lasted until week 15. In 2017/18 the epidemic threshold was crossed in week 52 of 2017 until week 14 of 2018 [11] .\n\nAnother factor contributing to the severity of the season might be the patient population itself. Both the attack rate and the relative illness ratio of influenza B are highest for children and decrease with age [24, 25] . However, the major difference that was seen for the season 2017/18 was the higher proportion of adult patients. The age-subgroups themselves, being pediatric patients and adult patients, were not different in their clinical characteristics between 2017/18 and the two previous seasons. However, the adult population that was seen had a high proportion of comorbidities and risk factors that might have contributed to a Fig. 3 (continued) severe outcome of the influenza disease, as it is known for example for cardiac insufficiency [26] , additionally to age itself [2, 27, 28] . A shift towards the adult population thus increases the impact on the public health system and may explain the severity of this season with a high number of excess consultations. An interpretation of the presented clinical data, however, needs to be done with caution as there may be a bias towards severe disease courses in a hospital setting. A fatality rate of 11.2% of the adult population of this study can thus not be transferred to the general population.\n\nA third potential factor may be the circulating influenza type. The Yamagata-lineage of influenza B was predominantly found in the season of 2017/18. In contrast to the Victoria lineage, which has a faster evolution with nearly each season representing a phylogenetic bottleneck, the biology of the Yamagata lineage is different. In long term studies of the HA of the Yamagata lineage a long co-circulation of Yamagata variants was observed [3, 13, 29] . In accordance with these observations the analyzed strains of this study were phylogenetically closely related. Furthermore, the detected amino acid changes were scattered throughout the HA and to the best of our knowledge no substitution is known for increased virus pathogenicity.\n\nSince 2000, changes in the antigenic sites are dominantly located in the 120-loop and 190-helix regions, indicating main targets for immune pressure. With regard to the vaccine strain B/Phuket/3073/2013 the main antigenic regions were only affected in 9 strains and occurred mainly in the 120-loop region, followed by the 160-loop region for the analyzed Yamagata strains. In contrast, all analyzed Victoria strains had at least one amino acid change in the 120-loop region with regard to the vaccine strain B/Brisbane/60/2008. It is therefore surprising that the Yamagatalineage that circulated in the population for three consecutive seasons was able to cause such a major epidemic. Table 3 Amino acid changes of the Victoria-and Yamagata-strains with regard to the respective vaccine strain.\n\nAmino acids are numbered with regard to the HA0 protein, and HA1 as well as HA2 subunits are indicated. The vaccine strains to which the isolates were compared are given in red for each lineage. Isolates from this study are labeled as vaccinated with trivalent vaccine (triangle), vaccinated with tetravalent vaccine (square), randomly selected case without vaccination history (circle), fatal cases (black filled symbols). Symbols represent the main antigenic sites, 120-loop (A; amino acids 116-137, 38, 56, 75, 177, 179-181), 150-loop (B; amino acids 141-150), 160-loop (C; amino acids 162-167) and 190helix (D; amino acids 194-202). *For the Yamagata-lineage, 48 strains, that were identical at amino acid level, are depicted as a pool and contain patients with the following characteristics: 15xs; 15xd; 3xh, 1xj, 14x4.\n\nA reason for this might be the interplay between the circulating influenza strains causing infections and the choice of the vaccine components or type of vaccine. In the season of 2015/16 Influenza A/H1N1 pdm09 and the Victoria-lineage of influenza B caused the majority of influenza infections. In 2016/17 influenza A/H3N2 was the main cause of flu disease. When looking at the influenza B component of the broadly used trivalent influenza vaccine there was a switch from B/Phuket/3073/2013-like (Yamagata-lineage) to B/ Brisbane/60/2008-like (Victoria-lineage) in the season 2016/17, effectively causing a mismatch in each of the three studied seasons. In 2017/18 the only strain that was not immunologically covered by recent epidemics or the current vaccine composition was the influenza B Yamagata-lineage. An increased proportion of non-immune individuals in the adult population thus may have contributed to the observed shift in the age distribution of the infected patients.\n\nCross-reactive antibodies can be isolated from vaccinated individuals [30, 31] but the contribution to the immunity against influenza B is not well defined. Some degree of lineage crossprotection has been reported upon vaccination with trivalent influenza virus vaccines. However, it seems to be limited to certain age groups and the vaccine efficacy is consistently superior for influenza B strains belonging to the vaccine lineage [32, 33, 16] . The capability of an individual to generate a broad antibody response against epitopes that include regions conserved between the two lineages, e.g. in the HA stalk, seems to be of major importance. Thus, the factors influencing lineage cross-protection are complex and not easy to predict as also the immune memory may have a substantial impact on the targeted epitopes [34, 35] .\n\nIn 76% of the patients with a vaccination history in this study the trivalent vaccine, with an expected moderate level of vaccine efficiency [7] , was used. The majority of the vaccinated patients were adults. However, a major improvement to influenza disease burden may only be accomplished by extending vaccine recommendations to younger age groups that are immunologically more na\u00efve and thus more susceptible to infections [36, 25] . WHO recommendations for the use of tetravalent vaccines that contain two influenza B strains (Yamagata and Victoria) in addition to the two influenza A strains (H1N1 and H3N2) should be implemented in national vaccination guidelines as it was done in Germany as a result of the severity of the 2017/18 influenza season.
