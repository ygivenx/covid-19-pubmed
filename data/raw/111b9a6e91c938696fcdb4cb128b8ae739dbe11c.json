{"title": "Clinical features and sexual transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 infected female patients: a descriptive study in Wuhan, China", "body": ". In addition, SARS-CoV was detected in urine, feces and tears of some SARS-CoV infected patients. It was confirmed that SARS-CoV could be transmitted through fecal-oral and contiguous pathways 6, 8 . Thus far, there has not been a report to show if SARS-CoV can be transmitted through sexual transmission. Therefore, based on the transmission route of SARS-CoV, current preventive measures, including maintaining good personal and environmental health, and implementing strict contact and droplet prevention measures in the community, can effectively prevent the spread of SARS-CoV 6 . However, different from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, another virus of the same coronavirus family, which was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and later spread to several other countries 9,10 , was transmitted through large droplets and close contact, although the possibility of air transmission or dust mite transmission was not ruled out 9 . Also, it is not clear whether MERS-CoV is sexually transmitted. The World Health Organization (WHO) has provided recommendations for the prevention of MERS-CoV, mainly including droplet and contact precautions 11 . Interestingly, HCoV-229E in the coronavirus family was detected in the maternal vagina and also found in the gastric swab samples of newborns 12 . This makes the sexual transmission of this type of virus possible although there is no direct evidence to prove it. Therefore, it also remains possible that SARS-CoV-2, as a new type of coronavirus, could be sexually transmitted.\n\nCurrently, the main known transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 is through respiratory air droplets. The other routes could be through secretary liquids, such as from eyes 13, 14 . SARS-CoV-2 was shown to exist in the feces of patients with COVID-19, suggesting that fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is possible 15 . Although there is currently no evidence for vertical transmission 16 \n\nThe gynecologic history, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, chest computed tomography (CT) and outcome data were obtained from patients' records. To ascertain the authenticity and integrity of the gynecologic history, especially the sexual behavior history, we also directly communicated with patients or their families.\n\nAll information was obtained and curated with a standardized data collection form.\n\nTwo researchers also independently reviewed the data collection forms to double check the data. Sample collection, processing, and laboratory testing complied with WHO guidance.\n\nPositive confirmatory cases of COVID-19 infection were defined as those with a positive test result from either laboratory.\n\nSPSS software, version 20\u00b70, was used for statistical analysis. The continuous measurements were presented as mean (SD) if they were normally distributed or median (IQR) if they were not, and categorical variables as count (%). For laboratory results, we also assessed whether the measurements were outside the normal range.\n\nAll rights reserved.

The final version of the article was approved by all authors.\n\n35 patients with COVID-19 were recruited in this study, the range of their age was 37-88, with a mean age of 61\u00b75 years (SD =11\u00b72; Table 1 ). Most patients were natives of Wuhan (n =29, 82.9%), and only one had directly contacted with Huanan seafood market. The most common chronic medical diseases were hypertension (n =12, 34.3%) and diabetes (n =7, 20%). As for gynecological diseases, uterine fibroids were mentioned the most (n =13, 37\u00b71%). Other diseases included cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) III, endometrial atypical hyperplasia, and endometrial cancer, with one patient for each disease. Most patients had entered menopause (n =28, 80%). For the rest 7 patients, except for 1 puerperal woman who had a cesarean section 2 days before with breast milk and neonatal throat swab SARS-CoV-2 negative, the remaining 6 patients still had menstruation, in which half of them complained of decreased menstrual flow.\n\nThe most common first symptom was fever (n =25, 71\u00b74%), Due to the special diagnostic principles in Wuhan; only 27 (77\u00b71%) patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Throat swab). The remaining 8 patients were clinically diagnosed depend on the images of CT scan (Table2). All patients in this study were classified at admission, including mild group (n =1, 2\u00b79%), severe group (n =32, 91\u00b74%) and critical group (n =2, 5\u00b77%, Table 2 ). After admission, the white blood cell count was decreased in 5 (14\u00b73%) patients and increased in 4 patients (11\u00b74%, Table 3 ). 16 (45\u00b77%) patients had a lymphocyte count reduction, while 18 patients (51.4%) had a lymphocyte ratio below the normal range. C-reactive protein (CRP) level was increased in 14 (40%) patients. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate accelerated in 19 (54\u00b73%) patients. 10 (28.6%) patients had increased aspartate transaminase (AST), and 13 (37\u00b71%) patients had elevated alanine transaminase (ALT). The serum potassium was decreased in 5 patients (14\u00b73%) and increased in 3 patients (8\u00b76%). All rights reserved.

IL-2R, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 were higher than the normal range in half or more patients, respectively. Notably, 9 (32\u00b71%) patients' level of IL-2R, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 increased altogether. Every patient showed typical findings of chest CT images-multiple patchy ground-glass shadows in lungs. Typical images from each group were demonstrated ( Figure 1 ).\n\nMost patients received antiviral and antibiotic treatment (n =33, 94\u00b73% and n =29, 82\u00b79% respectively), 13 (37\u00b71%) patients received glucocorticoids ( Table 2 ). 9\n\n(25\u00b77%) patients received intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. Three (8\u00b76%) patients received anticoagulant therapy. Oxygen therapy was used for every patient.\n\nMost of the patients received oxygen by mask or nasal catheter. Only 2 (5\u00b77%) patients received non-invasive ventilation with bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), and they were free of BiPAP on the day we collected the samples. No patient received Invasive ventilation ( Table 2 ). By the end of Feb 22, 1 (2\u00b79%) patient had been discharged, and all other patients were still in the hospital ( Table 1) .\n\nThe infection rate for the 35 female patents' sexual partner was up to 42\u00b79%, but only 2 patients, Patient 14 and 19, admitted having sexual behavior with their partners from 14 days before the onset of first symptoms to the day we collected samples (Table 1, Table 4 , Figure 2 ). The detailed timelines are exhibited ( Figure 2 ). Both patients use intrauterine device for contraception. Patient 14 was 48 years old. She had regular sex behavior during the 14 days before first symptom ( Figure 2 ). While stopped since she suffered from fever with a highest temperature above 39\u00b70\u2103.\n\nPatient 19 was 41 years old. Her duration of sex behavior was longer than patient 14, which ended at the day she was diagnosed by throat swab. Her first symptom was also fever, but the highest temperature (38\u00b79\u2103) is lower than patient 14 and her symptoms were mild in need of lower flow of oxygen ( Figure 2 ). Patient 19's partner was clinical diagnosed with COVID-19, while patient 14's was not.\n\nAnalysis of SARS-CoV-2 was conducted using the vaginal environment and anal swab samples of 35 female patients with COVID-19. All the vaginal environment samples (35 cases in total) were negative. One anal swab sample (35 cases in total) All rights reserved.

Her husband was also diagnosed with COVID-19, while they had no sexual behavior from 14 days before the first of symptoms to the day samples collected.\n\nThe evidence so far suggests that respiratory droplets and intimate contact are the two main transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 [19] [20] [21] [22] . Aerosol transmission also exists in relatively closed unventilated space 23 . Fecal-oral transmission is possible 23 . Vertical transmission have not been verified 16, 23 , although scientists have found that SARS-CoV-2 is positive in feces and blood 15 , while negative in amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk 16 . In addition, asymptomatic infected persons are potential sources of infection, with the long incubation period, increasing the difficulty in epidemic prevention and control 24 . Therefore, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is still worth exploring.\n\nHerein, we reported a cohort of 35 female patients, with an age range of 37-88.\n\nAdditionally, over 54\u00b73% (19/35) patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had chronic diseases including cancer (Table 1) , are more susceptible due to the weaker immune function 25 , in accordance with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 5 . There was a special patient undergoing caesarean section due to scar uterus contractions. We obtained the vaginal secretions on the third day after operation and found the SARS-CoV-2 negative similar to breastmilk, anal swab and neonatal throat swab samples. Up to now, no evidence suggested that pregnant women need caesarean section merely because of SARS-CoV-2 positive in mother's throat swab 16 .\n\nOur study showed that female patients with COVID-19 have a similar trait of clinical characteristics to the patients reported recently. Most common first symptom was fever (25, 71\u00b74%). Lymphopenia was a common phenomenon, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 might primarily target lymphocytes, like SARS-CoV 5 . IL-2R, IL6, and TNF-\u03b1 were above the normal range in half patients. A cytokine storm was induced after SARS-CoV-2 infection, followed by large amounts of immune responses and changes in immune cells such as lymphocytes, which was same as people infected SARS-CoV 5,26 . Oxygen therapy was used for every patient to improve hypoxia. Most patients received antiviral treatment and antibiotic treatment to inhibit virus All rights reserved.

Glucocorticoids and immunoglobulin therapy used in some patients is in order to inhibit inflammatory response based on \"cytokine storm\" theory. However, some researchers suggested that the use of antibiotics and glucocorticoids are not good for patients due to lacking strong evidence 21 .\n\nSex behavior is a cluster of intimate contacts involving hugs, kisses, and oral/anal it was probably many patients had hidden their sex history. So, sex partners got infected by the intimate contacts during sex might be more than one in the 42\u00b79% group. If one of the involvers in a sex behavior is in incubation period or is asymptomatic patient, the risk of the other involver got infected is pretty high. As asymptomatic persons are potential sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection 24 .\n\nTransmission between family members occurred in 13-21% of MERS cases and 22-39% of SARS cases 5 . Moreover, many patients with SARS or MERS were infected through super-spreaders 5 . Investigators had reported that the main route of All rights reserved.

First, the sample size was relatively small in which only 35 patients with SARS-CoV-2 positive or CT suspected was included; much more patients including sexually active women are needed to confirm our findings in the future. Second, samples from partner of the patients enrolled is missing, including anal swabs, semen, and urethral orifice swabs. Nevertheless, the data in our study revealed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of female patients with COVID-19 in a new prospective. In summary, though no evidence was found in this study that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by vaginal sex from female to the partner.\n\nConsidering the complexity of sexual behavior and the transmission potential of asymptomatic infectives, we suggest that people who lived in the epidemic areas, have tourism history from epidemic areas and were potentially asymptomatic infected should be very cautious about sex behavior and avoid oral/anal sex especially, which may be helpful to prevent further spreading of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nPC, X Ma, and SW made substantial contributions to the study concept and design.\n\nPC, ZC, TW and JD took responsibility for obtaining written consent from patients, obtaining ethical approval, collecting samples, and confirming data accuracy.
