{"title": "Chyloabdomen in a cat with pancreatic carcinoma", "body": "In human and veterinary medicine, chyloabdomen is a rare condition. It results from leakage of lipid-rich lymph into the peritoneal cavity, secondarily to obstruction or increased permeability of lymphatic vessels. In cats, it is believed to be mostly of neoplastic origin. Medical investigation relies on a systematic approach and definitive diagnosis often requires histopathological samples.\n\nThis report describes the exploration and management of a chyloabdomen secondary to pancreatic carcinoma in a 12-year-old cat.\n\nA 12-year-old neutered female domestic shorthair cat was referred for evaluation of an abdominal effusion.\n\nThe owners reported an abdominal distension of three weeks duration, with conservation of general demeanor and appetite. The referring veterinarian detected an abdominal effusion. A chyloabdomen was suspected, according to the gross appearance of the liquid.\n\nThe cat was housed mainly outside. Her vaccination status was not up-to-date.\n\nOn physical examination, the cat was bright, alert and normothermic. The body condition score was of 4 out of 9 and she had an unkempt haircoat. A marked abdominal distension was noted. No pain was elicited on abdominal palpation. Cardiorespiratory parameters were within normal limits.\n\nAbdominocentesis was performed under sedation. Approximately 300 mL of milky fluid were removed. Triglycerides content in the effusion was highly increased (102.84 g/L; reference range 0.30-1.60). The cytologic analysis of the fluid showed 1000 erythrocytes/\u00b5L and 1500 leukocytes/\u00b5L, including neutrophils (48%), monocytes (40%) and small, mature lymphocytes (12%). No bacteria nor neoplastic cells were visualized. Based on these findings, chyloabdomen was confirmed.\n\nComplete blood count and biochemistry profile were within normal limits. In-house tests for feline immunodeficiency virus antibody and feline leukemia virus antigen were negative. A feline coronavirus research by polymerase chain reaction on effusion was negative. Echocardiography was unremarkable. Abdominal ultrasound showed remaining abdominal effusion and an ill-defined heterogeneous mesenteric aggregate in the cranial abdomen, assumed to be mesenteric fat reaction due to chronic effusion. No mass was identified and the pancreas showed no significant ultrasonographic abnormalities. Computed tomodensitometry (CT) with lymphangiography was planned.\n\nThoracic CT scan was within normal limits. On abdominal CT scan, the amorphous mesenteric aggregate, previously identified on ultrasound, was seen, surrounding the portal vein (Fig. 1).\n\nThe caudal extremity of the right lobe of the pancreas was slightly thickened and it was in contact with the mesenteric aggregate. It had ill-defined heterogenous contrast enhancement (Fig. 2).\n\nCT scan lymphangiography was performed by injection of contrast media in perianal subcutaneous tissue, as previously described in dogs by Ando et al. (2012). The perianal area was clipped and surgically prepared. Using a 25-gauge needle, a warmed water-soluble contrast media (iodixanol, Visipaque\u2122 320, GE Healthcare SAS, V\u00e9lizy-Villacoublay, France) was injected in the subcutaneous tissue surrounding the anus at 0.6 mL/kg.\n\nThe administration site was subsequently massaged for 5 minutes. Images were obtained with a multi-detector helical CT scan at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 minutes after injection. Only two lymph nodes in the sacral region and one hypogastric were marked with iodixanol. The remaining lymphatic system was not correctly visualized.\n\nAs no definitive diagnosis had been made, and given the mesenteric lesion of undetermined origin, an exploratory laparotomy was performed.\n\nDiazepam (Valium\u00ae Roche 10mg/2mL, Roche, Boulogne-Billancourt, France), 0.3 mg/kg body weight (BW), IV, was given as premedication. Anesthesia was induced using alfaxalone titrated to effect (Alfaxan\u00ae 10mg/mL, Dechra Veterinary Products SAS, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France), 3 mg/kg BW, IV. Oro-tracheal intubation was readily performed with a 3-mm cuffed tube.\n\nAnesthesia was maintained with isoflurane (Vetflurane\u00ae 1000mg/g, Virbac, Carros, France) vaporized in oxygen. Analgesia was provided by morphine (Morphine Lavoisier 10mg/mL, C.D.M. Lavoisier, Paris, France), 0.2 mg/kg BW, IV, q2h. A midline laparotomy was performed.\n\nA large amount of chylous effusion was removed. The mesentery was folded upon itself by necrotic adhesions. Those were released and biopsies of the abnormal mesentery close to the pancreas and of mesenteric and pancreaticoduodenal lymph nodes were obtained. No other abnormalities were seen on thorough examination of abdominal cavity. Abdomen wall was closed routinely.\n\nThe cat recovered well from the anesthesia. She was discharged 2 days after surgery with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, 20 mg/kg BW, PO, q12h for 5 days (K\u00e9sium\u00ae 62.5mg, Ceva Sant\u00e9 Animale, Libourne, France), rutin, 62.5 mg/kg BW, PO, q8h, and a low-fat diet (Royal Canin gastro-intestinal low fat, Royal Canin SAS, Aimargues, France).\n\nBiopsies revealed exocrine pancreatic tissue infiltrated by solid sheets of large polygonal cells with oval nuclei, prominent nucleoli and coarse chromatin (Fig. 3). Anisokaryosis was moderate and mitotic rate was low. Mesenteric fat tissue showed necrotic areas surrounded by vacuolated macrophages (Fig. 4). Lymph node biopsies were free from metastatic lesions. Pancreatic carcinoma with mesenteric necrotic and granulomatous remodeling was diagnosed.\n\nStandard chemotherapy and targeted therapy (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) were declined. The cat was palliatively maintained under rutin and low-fat diet (Royal Canin gastro-intestinal low fat, Royal Canin SAS, Aimargues, France).\n\nThree days after discharge, the cat was presented to the referring veterinarian for inappetence and depression. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (Metacam\u00ae 0,5 mg/ml Suspension orale pour chats, Boehringer Ingelheim France Division Sant\u00e9 Animale, Reims, France) were prescribed for a few days and the cat improved.\n\nOn telephonic follow-up, three weeks after discharge, the patient was in good general condition. No relapse of the abdominal effusion was reported.\n\nHowever, one month after surgery, the cat was presented to her regular veterinarian for decreased appetite. 200 mL of abdominal effusion were removed. Despite administration of prednisolone (Dermipred\u00ae 5mg, Ceva Sant\u00e9 Animale, Libourne, France), maropitant (C\u00e9r\u00e9nia\u00ae 16mg, Zoetis, Paris, France), and mirtazapine (Norset\u00ae 15mg, MSD France, Courbevoie, France), the cat\u2019s condition worsened with rapid recurrence of effusion. She was euthanized 52 days after the surgery.\n\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest."}
