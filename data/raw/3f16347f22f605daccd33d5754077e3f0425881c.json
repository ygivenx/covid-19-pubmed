{"title": "7 Advances in disease diagnosis, vaccine development and other emerging methods to control pathogens in aquaculture", "body": "Disease is still regarded as a major constraint to aquaculture production globally (Adams et al., 2005) . As the industry continues to expand and diversify, the risk of new diseases emerging and old ones spreading to other geographical regions is a reality. The movement of eggs and fry between fi sh farms presents ideal circumstances for pathogens to adapt with their hosts and environment. Control of pathogens is complex and relies heavily on a combination of pathogen detection, disease diagnosis, treatment, prevention and general health management. Rapid disease diagnosis and vaccination play a huge part in this, and there has been signifi cant progress in both of these areas since the 1980s. In the years since 2000 the pace has increased even more as methods developed for clinical and veterinary medicine are rapidly adapted and optimised for use in aquaculture. Novel diagnostic methods are published frequently and the success of vaccination in reducing the use of antibiotics has been realised, at least in some countries. Innovative alternative methods for the control of fi sh diseases are also being researched and applied. This chapter aims to provide a review of the recent advances made in disease diagnosis, vaccine development and other emerging methods to control pathogens in aquaculture.\n\nThe main key driver to improve disease diagnosis and vaccine development is the continued signifi cant losses to the industry caused by pathogens. Bacterial diseases cause a substantial economic burden to the aquaculture industry and, although antibiotics and chemotherapeutants are extensively used to control disease outbreaks, there is increasing concern about their use because of drug residues in food, the development of antimicrobial drug resistance and the detrimental effect on the aquatic microbial ecosystems and populations (Thompson and Adams, 2004) . There is a concerted effort to move away from the use of antibiotics wherever possible. This was highlighted in September 2008 in Korea with the announcement that from next year the Korea Food and Drug Administration will ban the use of seven types of antibiotics in feed for livestock and fi sh raised in fi sh farms. In the UK, Norway and Japan there has already been a signifi cant reduction in the use of antibiotics since the 1990s (Adams et al., 2005; Markestad and Grave, 1997) .\n\nThere is a real need to increase production of fi sh globally through aquaculture and therefore health and welfare must be given a high priority if targets set are to be reached. Some vaccines, in particular multivalent vaccines, have led to welfare concerns in the past few years due to the presence of adhesions on internal organs, thought to result from oil-based adjuvants in the vaccines (Berg et al., 2007) . Farming of new species will play a signifi cant role in increasing production. Persistent disease problems in cod (Vibriosis in particular) have played a large part in this new industry stagnating in Scotland. As cobia farming increases globally, and with the fi rst farms being licensed in Brazil (Eric Routledge, Special Secretariat for Aquaculture and Fisheries, SEAP, Brazil; pers comm), there will be a need for farmers to be one step ahead of potential disease threats.\n\nMany of the current techniques for the detection of pathogens and diagnosis of diseases are actually very good. On the other hand, identifi cation of certain pathogens is diffi cult to achieve and some of the methods developed may be too complicated to apply or interpret. Conventional pathogen isolation and characterisation techniques, alongside pathology, still remain the methods of choice for the diagnosis of many diseases. However, these traditional methods tend to be costly, labour-intensive, and slow, and might not always lead to a defi nitive diagnosis being made. The rapid progress made in biotechnology since the 1990s has enabled the development and improvement of a wide range of immunodiagnostic and molecular techniques (Cunningham, 2004; Thompson, 2006, 2008) , and reagents and commercial kits have become more widely available. These rapid methods both complement and enhance the traditional methods of disease diagnosis.\n\nThe Manual of Diagnostic Tests for Aquatic Animals (World Organisation for Animal Health, 2006) includes a variety of standardised methods (including traditional, immunological and molecular methods) for the identifi cation of selected pathogens (causing notifi able diseases), and these will expand as new methods are developed and validated (Adams and Thompson, 2008) . Most of these are, however, for viral diseases, and Renibacteriun salmoninarum and Piscirickettsia salmonis, the causative agents of bacterial kidney disease (BKD) and ricketsiosis, respectively, are the only bacterial pathogens included. The diseases caused by these pathogens do not meet the listing criteria, but they are included because reporting requirements for non-listed diseases apply in regard to signifi cant epidemiological events. For those diseases not included in the Animal Health Code there are no set standards. It is important that reagents and methods used for detecting bacterial pathogens are standardised and rigorously tested for specifi city and sensitivity. Commercial reagents and kit development (Adams and Thompson, 2008) have gone some of the way to achieving this, but there still is not a full range of reagents or kits available for use in aquaculture. The cost, speed, specifi city and sensitivity of assays are all extremely important to end-users. The highest cost is often time, although labour costs do vary considerably between countries. Many of the new technologies require specialised equipment and highly skilled staff and few of the existing methodologies are suited to fi eld testing, or use in rudimentary laboratories.\n\nDisease diagnosis is currently made using a variety of methods, as reviewed by Adams and Thompson (2008) . Traditional bacteriology, whereby the pathogen is isolated and identifi ed biochemically (e.g. using API\u00ae strips), and observation of histological sections from diseased fi sh are widely used. Rapid methods that specifi cally identify the pathogen using antibodies (immunodiagnostics) or by amplifying specifi c sequences of DNA or RNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (i.e. molecular diagnostics) are also regularly used in many laboratories. In some instances molecular diagnostics has completely taken over from other methodologies. For many of the rapid methods live and dead pathogens cannot be distinguished; therefore, the inclusion of enrichment methods and the use of live/dead kits are useful supplementary methods (Vatsos et al., 2002) . Interpretation of results using rapid methods of pathogen detection should be carefully considered with all the other clinical evidence, including histology and attempted culture of the pathogen. Immunodiagnostic methods such as immunohistochemistry (IHC), the fl uorescence antibody test (FAT) and indirect fl uorescence antibody test (IFAT) enable rapid specifi c detection of pathogens in tissue samples without the need to fi rst isolate the pathogen. The IHC method is a simple extension of histology allowing specifi c identifi cation of pathogens in formalin tissue fi xed sections (Adams and Marin de Mateo, 1994; Steiropoulos et al., 2002) , while FAT/IFAT is extremely rapid and sensitive as well as being specifi c but requires a fl uorescent microscope to read the results (Adams et al., 1995; Miles et al., 2003; Klesius et al., 2006) . Both IHC and FAT/IFAT are technically easy to perform, and examples of the results obtained using these methods are shown in Fig. 7 .1. (p. 201 , see also colour section.) A variety of other antibody-based methods have also been developed for use in aquaculture. Some are very simple to use, but usually require pathogen isolation prior to use and lack in sensitivity (e.g. agglutination), while others are more complex, but with the added advantage of pathogen quantifi cation (e.g. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA), or detection and characterisation of specifi c pathogen antigens to their molecular weight, e.g. Western blot (Rose et al., 1989; Adams and Thompson 1990; Adams, 1992 Adams, , 2004 . The ELISA also has the advantage of high throughput and automated equipment is available.\n\nThe ELISA can also be used for serology (detecting antibodies to specifi c pathogens). Although serology is an essential screening tool in clinical medicine and in most control programmes for the signifi cant diseases of domestic animals (Palmer-Densmore et al., 1998; Yuce et al., 2001; Fournier and Raoult, 2003) it has not yet been validated for any bacterial diseases in fi sh. Serology is used effectively for detecting exposure to fi sh viruses, such as koi herpesvirus (KHV) (Adkinson et al., 2005; Adams and Thompson, 2008) , but bacterial pathogens pose a much more complex picture with cross reactivities likely unless specifi c known proteins are used to coat the ELISA plates rather than whole pathogens.\n\nThe use of molecular technologies for the detection of fi sh bacterial pathogens is rapidly increasing and a vast array of methods has already been developed (Karunasagar et al., 1997; Cunningham, 2004; Thompson 2006, 2008; Wilson and Carson, 2003) . Molecular methods generally have the highest sensitivity and are therefore particularly useful for detecting microorganisms that are present in low numbers or for those that are diffi cult to culture. In addition, molecular methods can be used for the identifi cation of pathogens to species level (Puttinaowarat et al., 2000; Pourahmed, 2008) and in epidemiology for the identifi cation of individual strains and differentiating closely related strains (Cowley et al., 1999) . The PCR is the best known method, although there are many useful variations, including nested PCR, random amplifi cation of polymorphic DNA (RAPD), reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR), reverse cross blot PCR (rcb-PCR) and RT-PCR enzyme hybridisation assay (Puttinaowarat et al., 2000; Wilson and Carson, 2003; Cunningham, 2004) . Colony hybridisation has also been used successfully for the rapid identifi cation of Vibrio anguillarum in fi sh (Aoki et al., 1989) and has the advantage of detecting both pathogenic and environmental strains (Powell and Loutit, 2004) . Real-time PCR (also known as qPCR) offers quantifi cation and high sample throughput. Real- (Jansson et al., 2008) and Edwardsiella ictaluri (US Patent 6951726), and it is likely that this range will expand rapidly. Polygenic sequencing following PCR of specifi c genes is being recommended for the identifi cation of some pathogens where differentiation of closely related species is difficult. For example, Pourahmed (2008) found that sequencing of three different genes was necessary to classify certain mycobacteria species from fi sh. A variety of novel rapid diagnostic methods are currently being developed that have potential for future application in the diagnosis of aquatic animal health. These were recently reviewed by Adams and Thompson (2008) , and comparisons were made between these methods and existing technologies with regard to their advantages and disadvantages. Loop-mediated isothermal amplifi cation (LAMP) is an emerging technology with potential for detection of fi sh and shellfi sh pathogens, and research tests to detect Edwardsiella tarda, E. ictaluri, Nocardia seriolae, and Flavobacterium psychrophilum (bacterial pathogens that cause edwardsiellois, enteric septicemia of catfi sh and nocardiosis, respectively), Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae (the parasite that causes proliferative kidney disease, PKD) and infectious haematopoitic necrosis virus (IHNV) in fi sh and white spot syndrome virus (WWSV) in shrimp have already been developed (Savan et al., 2005; Manji, 2008) . A commercial LAMP test kit is available for WSSV. The LAMP is a relatively new method for amplifying DNA which relies on autocycling strand displacement DNA synthesis and, since it is carried out under isothermal conditions, it can be performed without the use of a thermocycler. The method uses Bst DNA polymerase and a set of four specially designed primers (two inner and two outer primers) to recognise a total of six distinct sequences on the template DNA (Notomi et al., 2000) . The main advantages of the method are the speed with which it can be performed, its sensitivity, and the fact that the results are read by eye, and, although the test requires the use of pipettes and an incubator, it does not require any other specialised equipment. Figure 7 .2 (p. 203, see also colour section) shows the results of a LAMP test carried out to identify Flavobacterium psychrophilum, where a simple colour change in the tube from orange to green indicates a positive. Simple rapid fi eld tests using lateral fl ow technology are also in development, and rapid kits are currently commercially available to detect infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV) and WSSV in shrimp. Although there are none yet for bacterial pathogens in fi sh, this type of technology has been successfully developed for clinical (Gatta et al., 2004) and veterinary use (Bautista et al., 2002) and offers simple fi eld test capabilities.\n\nThere is also interest in the development of multiplex tests to simultaneously detect different pathogens in a single sample. Multiplex technologies such as the Luminex xMAP TM (a bead array) and microarray both have huge potential in this area, but these are currently expensive and labourintensive as assays are still being developed and optimised (Adams and Thompson, 2008 ). The xMap system theoretically offers simultaneous quantitative analysis of up to 100 different analytes from a single drop of sample in an integrated, 96-well formatted system (Dunbar, 2006) . This is complex technology with huge potential as it can be used for vaccine development, through epitope mapping (Costa et al., 2007) , as well as pathogen detection. This is fl exible technology as antibodies, protein or DNA can be bound to the bead array. A number of research groups are also currently developing DNA and oligo microarray technology for diagnostics and these also will offer simultaneous detection of pathogens for the future (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2004; Matsuyama et al., 2006) .\n\nA wide range of commercial vaccines is available against bacterial pathogens, with most targeting salmon and trout, with additional vaccines available for channel catfi sh, European seabass and seabream, Japanese amberjack and yellowtail, tilapia and Atlantic cod (Thompson and Adams, 2004; Adams et al., 2005; Sommerset et al., 2005 (Thompson and Adams, 2004; Adams et al., 2005) . The primary considerations for vaccines for aquaculture are cost-effectiveness and safety. Vaccines need to provide long-term protection against diseases on commercial fi sh farms. All the serotypic variants of the disease agent need to be considered, the time/age when the animal is most susceptible to disease, the route of administration and the method of vaccine preparation (i.e. inactivated whole cell, attenuated, subunit, recombinant). In order to develop an effective vaccine the protective antigens need to be identifi ed and their protective response confi rmed in the host species. The latter may be antibody mediated, cell mediated or both depending on the vaccine components. A practical method of administration and an inexpensive method of vaccine production also need to be established.\n\nIt is important in vaccine development to work with the antigens that are expressed during infection rather than antigens expressed in the laboratory. Many salmon vaccines from the past are based on inactivated (whole cell) cultures of the pathogenic organism (usually inactivated in formalin) grown in vitro. In these cases the vaccines gave good protection (e.g. Vibrio vaccine); however, many pathogens appear to switch off important protective antigens when cultured in vitro. In such cases alternative methods of culture (e.g. the inclusion of an iron-chelating agent) are required so that expression of the important 'protective' antigens is induced (Neelam et al., 1993) . This can be achieved by modifying the culture medium of the pathogen in vitro, as shown by Bakopoulos et al., (2003) and Jung et al., (2007) for Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida, the pathogen that causes pasteurellosis. The effects of altering the constituents of the media for culturing P. damselae subsp. piscicida in the laboratory on antigen expression are illustrated in Fig. 7 .3, where differences are observed in the antigens expressed/recognised by fi sh sera between media 1, 7 and 8, for example ( Fig. 7.3a, b) . Some antigens appear to be up-regulated whilst others are down-regulated. This also serves to highlight the difference between mammalian and fi sh immune systems, as fi sh (Fig. 7 .3b) recognise many fewer antigens than rabbits (Fig. 7.3a ).\n\nAn alternative approach is to place the pathogen of interest inside the peritoneal cavity of fi sh, enclosed in sealed chambers (that permit the exchange of small molecules only), so that antigen expression in vivo can be determined (Bakopoulos et al., 2004; Poobalane, 2007; Jung et al., 2008) . Figure 7 .4 shows how R. salmoninarum alters the expression of surface molecules when the bacterium is cultured in vivo or in vitro. Bacterial cells appears smooth and rounded when cultured in vitro in contrast to those cultured inside the host fi sh. Application of sera from fi sh (that have been infected with the disease of interest and then recovered) in Western blot analysis on one-or two-dimensional gels (immunoprotomics) can then pinpoint potential vaccine candidates that can then be identifi ed and vaccines produced (e.g. a recombinant vaccine against Aeromonas hydrophila, Poobalane, 2007). Of course these antigens may be expressed and the fi sh may respond by producing antibodies to them, but they may or may not be protective. Thus, challenge of vaccinated and nonvaccinated fi sh is then performed to establish if the vaccine is actually protective. Fish vaccines have become much more sophisticated since the mid-1990s. Technologies such as recombinant and DNA vaccines are powerful tools for vaccine development (Leong et al., 1997; Smith, 2000) as these enable the isolation of potential protective antigens from suppressive ones. These are being developed because the simpler approach of using inactivated whole cell vaccines did not succeed for many of the important diseases, and attempts at attenuated vaccines in general have not been encouraged from a safety point of view (Benmansour and de Kinkelin, 1997 ). An IPNV vaccine based on a recombinant expressed viral protein has been developed (Frost and Ness, 1997) and has been on the market for several years for use in salmon in Norway, but the licensing of other recombinant vaccines has been slow. DNA vaccines for fi sh have been shown to be effective when based on DNA-sequences encoding for rhabdovirus glycoproteins (Lorenzen and La Patra, 2005) and the fi rst DNA vaccine has been licensed in Canada against IHNV.\n\nVaccines for fi sh can be administered by a variety of different methods, i.e. injection (intramuscular or intra-peritoneally), immersion (bath or dipvaccination) or orally. There is much interest in developing oral vaccines as this is the most practical method of administration. In the absence of natural exposure, booster vaccination is needed to maintain immunity. Oral vaccine boosters have been used successfully and are marketed commercially. For example, oral vaccines are available against enteric red mouth (ERM) and vibriosis in rainbow trout, and against furunculosis and IPNV in salmon (Meeusen et al., 2007) . These vaccines employ an antigen protection vehicle to protect vaccines from the acid environment of the fi sh stomach, and improved delivery systems are currently being researched for a variety of vaccines.\n\nClose monitoring of stocks to ensure early detection of pathogens causing disease problems (and effective treatment) and vaccination to prevent infections are clearly not the only methods of disease control. Farmers can take a number of measures to manage the impact on healthy stocks, including improved nutrition/diet, and maintaining stocking densities at levels that optimise growth and avoid over-crowding that reduces the ability for the animal to resist infections. Immunostimmulants (e.g. glucans) added to diets have been reported to enhance the immune system of the fi sh in the short term, when applied either on their own or in vaccines as adjuvants, and are reported to be very affective at stimulating the nonspecifi c defense mechanisms of the animal ( Thompson and Adams, 2004; Peddie and Secombes, 2005) . Other dietary additives are also being used, sometimes to target specifi c diseases, e.g. addition of vitamin E to target salmon pancreas disease (SPD). A wide range of modifi ed diets and immunostimulants is available commercially and many new products are being researched (Bricknell and Dalmo, 2005; Peddie and Secombes, 2005) . In addition, probiotics are widely used in some countries (Birkbeck, 2004) .\n\nReducing the risk of exposure to, or impact on, healthy populations is also an effective alternative approach to pathogen control. Molecular methods (e.g. PCR) are ideal technologies to use for screening fi sh broodstock and eggs for the presence of pathogens, and as long as large enough sample sizes are tested (e.g. for eggs) this may prove to be an effective method of reducing the reservoir of specifi c pathogens on fi sh farms. Recently, Manji (2008) reported that, although the prevalence of Flavobacterium psychrophilum in rainbow trout eggs was very low (1-2.4 %) this still led to spread of disease (rainbow trout fry syndrome, RTFS) and mortalities when these eggs were grown on. In this study it was necessary to test at least 300 eggs per batch in the screening process.\n\nThe long-term approach to disease control is through the selection of disease-resistant strains or families of fi sh, and much research is currently focused on fi sh genotype and disease susceptibility (Biacchesi et al., 2007) . Selective breeding programs have been shown to have large benefi cial effects on production and quality traits in cold-water fi sh species, but only a small percentage of aquaculture production is based on genetically improved fi sh and shellfi sh (Gjedrem, 2000) . Resistance is a complex quantitative trait that is likely to be affected by many genes (Gjedrem et al., 1991; Grimholt et al., 2003) . To select for disease resistance it is necessary to challenge a large number of animals and measure each family's overall performance for the trait. Genes associated with disease and stress resistance are now being identifi ed and their characteristics will be used as identifi ers (markers) for selective breeding of disease-and/or stress-resistant individuals (Moen et al., 2004) . This approach should continue to be pursued, bearing in mind that increased resistance to one pathogen can result in decreased resistance to other pathogens.\n\nAs more nucleotide sequences become available for fi sh bacterial pathogens, this will provide opportunities to develop innovative alternative disease control methods. Recently, following the sequencing of R. salmoninarum, Sudheesh et al. (2007) described the identifi cation of a new class of drug (phenyl vinyl sulfone) which inhibits the activity of a very important enzyme (sortase) in R. salmoninarum. Inhibition of this enzyme appears to dramatically reduce the virulence of the bacterium by interfering with the ability of the bacterium to adhere and colonise fi sh cells. This drug could offer a promising alternative to antibiotics to control bacterial kidney disease in fi sh, and this type of approach holds potential for future control of bacterial disease in general for fi sh.\n\nTechnologies to assist with disease control are moving at a rapid pace. Careful consideration must be given to selecting which methods to take forward and apply in aquaculture. Vaccines need to be cost-effective and safe, and pathogen detection methods should be robust yet sensitive. There are many innovative technologies that may fulfi l these criteria and provide new vaccines and useful diagnostics tools. It is important, however, that the diagnostics methods already developed are standardised and fully validated, if they are considered useful, and that new technologies do not supersede these just because they are novel methods. They need to have clear advantages over the existing methods for use in aquaculture. Nanotechnology is an area being explored for the detection of pathogens in food (Kim et al., 2007) and in clinical and veterinary diagnostics, and this may prove extremely useful for application in diagnostics for aquatic animals. Nanotechnology is generally used when referring to materials of 0.1-100 nanometres; however, it is also inherent that these materials should display different properties from bulk (or micrometric and larger) materials as a result of their size. These differences include physical strength, chemical reactivity, electrical conductance, magnetism and optical effects. Such technology offers the ability to detect extremely low levels of pathogens very quickly, and progress has already been made for the identifi cation of foodborne pathogens (Joseph and Morrison, 2006) . Recently, the focus is on different types of sensors to detect pathogens and immunomagnetic reduction (IMR) technology has been reported for the detection of low levels of the H5N1 virus that causes bird fl u (Yang et al., 2008) . In this method magnetic nanoparticles were coated with antibody and a high-transition-temperature superconductive quantum interference device was used to sense the immunomagnetic reduction of the reagents.\n\nNanotechnology is also being used in conjunction with proteomics (Marko et al., 2007) and may be a useful technology to identify markers of disease and vaccine antigens. Immunoprotomics, as discussed in Section 7.5, is also known as 'reversed vaccinology' and has recently been successfully used for the development of a recombinant vaccine against A. hydrophila for carp (Poobalane, 2007) . Other technologies with the same approach are knockout technologies, which indicate whether specifi c antigens are essential or important for survival of the pathogen in the host. These methods have great potential for the future and include RNA interference where expression of certain genes is blocked by antisense RNA (Melamed et al., 2002) , in vivo expression technologies, IVET (Rainey and Preston, 2000) , and signature tagged mutagenesis (Saenz and Dehio, 2005) . The information obtained from a variety of these techniques is combined with data from existing literature to identify potential vaccine candidate antigens for cloning and for recombinant expression (Adams et al., 2005) .\n\nDelivery of DNA vaccines using bacteriophages has been reported to be successful in a number of animals including fi sh (Skurnik and Strauch, 2006) . The phage particles used are non-infectious and only grow on specialised laboratory strains of bacteria; the phage coat protects the vaccine from degradation and allows the host's immune system to process it more effi ciently (March et al., 2004; Clark and March, 2006) . This technology may be extremely useful for oral delivery of DNA vaccines for fi sh.\n\nGene sequencing underpins many of the new technologies being developed both for diagnostics and vaccine development and, as gene sequences become available for both pathogens and the host fi sh species, microarrays can be developed. These will enable very rapid progress to be made in fi sh health control for the future.\n\nIn addition to the references cited there are numerous websites that provide useful information and advice. These are summarised in Table 7 .1. "}
