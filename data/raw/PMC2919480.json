{"title": "Reassuring and managing patients with concerns about swine flu: Qualitative interviews with callers to NHS Direct", "body": "The 2009 outbreak of influenza A (H1N1), or 'swine flu,' killed 457 people in the UK between April 2009 and March 2010 [1]. Although the illness turned out to be relatively mild for most people, the early stages of the outbreak were characterised by uncertainty as to the nature and severity of the illness, with concern being expressed about the ability of medical services to cope with the volume of patients who might require help. While most attention focused on the ability of hospitals and primary care trusts to care for patients suffering from swine flu, [2] in practice most people who initially sought help did not have the illness. In the UK, NHS Direct, which is a 24 hour telephone and online health advice and information service staffed primarily by nurses and health information advisors, received approximately 63 000 calls relating to swine flu in the first month of the outbreak [3]. During the same period only 185 cases of swine flu were confirmed across the UK [4]. Although the tendency for large numbers of unaffected individuals to seek advice and assistance from the health services is a common occurrence during major public health incidents, [5,6] little evidence exists as to what factors motivate these patients to seek help. A common assumption is that this group consists of worried patients who require reassurance. [e.g. [7,8]]\n\nThe role of NHS Direct in providing information and reassurance to concerned members of the public during the swine flu outbreak sat within a broader strategy designed to relieve pressure on primary care physicians. After the World Health Organisation declared on 29 April that a pandemic was imminent, widespread Government advertisements about the condition began to appear in the UK, including an information leaflet delivered to every house in the country [9]. These mass media campaigns were supplemented by websites and an automated telephone line which contained more detailed information. Members of the public were advised that if they had \"just returned from Mexico or an affected country\" and \"think [you] might have swine flu\" they should check their symptoms on-line, call the automated telephone number and then telephone either their GP or NHS Direct \"if you have taken these steps and are still concerned.\" [9] Similar remote triage systems have also been used in other countries during both the swine flu outbreak and in previous major public health incidents [10,11]. Similar systems are also recommended for future incidents [5,6].\n\nWhile patients typically report that NHS Direct is a helpful and reassuring source of information and advice during normal circumstances, [12] whether this holds true during a major public health incident is less certain. Such incidents are often characterised by high levels of uncertainty about the severity of the risk that people face, uncertainty as to who is most at risk, the presence of conflicting advice from experts and official agencies, and extensive media coverage and speculation. All of these issues tend to increase levels of public concern [13] and make it difficult to provide effective reassurance to patients. Indeed, during one previous major incident in the UK, some people who spoke to NHS Direct or to the UK's Health Protection Agency by telephone reported that this contact added to their confusion or made them suspicious as to why they had been asked to contact these services at all [14].\n\nIn this study we used qualitative interviews with patients who contacted NHS Direct about swine flu during the early stages of the outbreak in order to assess whether the advice and reassurance given to them adequately met their needs and to explore the factors that were most reassuring for patients. Because we were also interested in understanding why people contacted the health services about swine flu during this period, despite most not having been exposed to the illness, we also asked a range of questions relating to patients' motivations for seeking advice.\n\nPeople were eligible for this study if they had contacted NHS Direct between 11 and 14 May 2009 in order to discuss swine flu, were 18 years or older, spoke English and had received only information or treatment at home advice. Our intention was to interview 30 to 40 patients who met these criteria. From prior experience [14] we felt that this number would allow us to identify the most important reasons people had for making contact with NHS Direct.\n\nOne NHS Direct call centre participated in the study. Call centre staff assessed eligibility and requested consent for contact details to be passed to us. Staff members were asked to recruit up to five callers each. The interviewers (RA, HC, GJR and LP) called consenting patients and informed them about the purposes of the research. Participants were again asked to verbally confirm their consent to take part in the interviews and were informed that all data would be anonymised by the removal of any personally identifiable material from our transcripts and publications. Participants were then guided through a semi-structured interview lasting 10 to 15 minutes (see Appendix 1). The questions asked in these interviews were specifically chosen in order to explore several key topics of interest that were identified a priori. We also asked one item adapted from the state trait anxiety inventory: \"when you called NHS Direct, how worried were you about the swine flu outbreak?\" [15] Permitted responses were 'very much,' 'moderately,' 'somewhat' and 'not at all.'\n\nInterviews were digitally recorded and transcribed. Qualitative analysis was conducted using a technique akin to a framework approach, [16] in that we approached the data with a set of pre-determined main themes in mind which we wished to explore. These were: reasons for wanting to speak to someone about swine flu; reasons why any prior information sources had not been sufficient; reasons motivating patients to speak to NHS Direct rather than to a different healthcare provider; reasons why speaking to NHS Direct had been reassuring; reasons why speaking to NHS Direct had provoked concern or anxiety; and reasons for wanting to seek more advice about swine flu after speaking to NHS Direct. We first looked for quotes from each transcript which related to one of these main themes. Within each theme, we then grouped quotes together which appeared to reflect the same underlying sub-theme, using an iterative process of refining and re-labelling these sub-themes. Once themes were identified, two researchers re-examined each transcript and identified how many participants had explicitly mentioned each sub-theme to ensure that they reflected general experiences among our participants rather than idiosyncratic findings relating to single people.\n\nThe National Research Ethics Service advised us to treat this study as a service evaluation, exempt from research ethics approval.\n\nFifteen participants (45%) reported that when they had called NHS Direct they were 'not at all' worried about swine flu. Eight were 'somewhat' worried, seven were 'moderately' worried and three were worried 'very much.'\n\nAppendix 2 summarises the sub-themes that emerged within each of our main themes.\n\nOnly two participants were asymptomatic when they initially sought information about swine flu. For them, the main motivating factor for seeking advice was a desire to discuss prophylaxis.\n\nThe remaining 31 participants had experienced flu-like symptoms or were phoning on behalf of someone who had. Within this group, the unusualness of their symptoms was often described as an important factor motivating them to seek advice, with unusualness typically defined in terms of unexpected severity or duration. For example, one participant noted that \"I've had a cold and I've had the flu and it only lasted about 2 days. But I had this about a week and a half. It's the first time I've had a cold that long and I was just thinking the worst.\" Some participants also mentioned that they wanted information about any distinguishing characteristics of swine flu, particularly in terms of its symptoms.\n\nConcern or uncertainty about having been exposed to swine flu was an additional factor motivating some participants to seek advice. Their explanations suggested a variety of perceptions as to what might count as exposure, ranging from mixing with others who had returned from an affected region (\"I'm a teacher, and a number of the kids had come back from the States, so I thought it was a possibility\"), to having been in roughly the same location as a known case (\"I came down with flu symptoms and I work at [an] airport. And there was two confirmed cases of swine flu gone through\"), to being among unknown people (\"I'm in a [waiting room] where patients are coming in all the time. Nobody is walking round with a label or a badge on saying 'I've just been to Mexico'\"). In contrast, other participants sought advice due to concern that they might expose others. For example, one commented that \"I work with children all day, so it's more for my fear that if I've got something like that, then it would go amongst children,\" while another explained that \"I just phoned up to make sure that I didn't have [swine flu]..., because I was visiting my parents and they're quite elderly and I was a bit worried.\"\n\nPressure from others was important for many participants. For some, this pressure came from friends or family. For others, it came from their employer and was not always well-received (e.g. \"I kind of thought I just had a bug. My school wouldn't let me go back until I'd had it confirmed that I didn't have swine flu... I thought it was quite a ridiculous assumption\").\n\nFor some patients, another motivation for seeking advice was a desire to obtain \"peace of mind,\" \"confirmation,\" or \"reassurance\" that they did not have swine flu. These participants appeared to recognise that they were unlikely to have it, but felt that they should err on the side of caution nonetheless (e.g. \"[I wanted] to confirm that I hadn't got this flu virus. So it was more so, you know, 'you definitely haven't.' That was the reassurance I needed\").\n\nFinally, some participants mentioned that personal risk factors had increased their motivation to speak to someone, for example age or pre-existing chronic illness.\n\nBefore telephoning NHS Direct, participants had variously sought information from the NHS Direct website, the Government leaflet on swine flu, their GP, other official websites, a pharmacy and a hospital. Three themes emerged as to why people felt they needed additional advice despite having already used these sources. First, a common reason was simply because the participant had been explicitly told that they needed to seek help from elsewhere. Second, people who had used an internet resource or the Government leaflet also made comments suggesting that they now wanted to speak to a human, because \"you can read so much in a leaflet, and you can watch so much, but I think when you speak to someone it's a bit more reassuring.\" Finally, a lack of trust in the initial source was important for some participants.\n\nFive themes reflected why participants eventually called NHS Direct, rather than seeking advice elsewhere. For some participants, it was because they had been informed that NHS Direct was the most appropriate place to get help, while others commented that using a telephone service would reduce their chances of giving swine flu to friends, family members or colleagues. Also important was the ease with which NHS Direct could be accessed. As one participant noted \"it's a lot less hassle than going to your GP.\" Trust in NHS Direct was mentioned by many participants. This often related to a previous positive experience with them (e.g. \"any time I ring NHS Direct about anything, it's always reassuring\"). Finally, some participants mentioned that they wanted to avoid burdening other medical services.\n\nMost participants did obtain reassurance from speaking to NHS Direct. Although some indicated that speaking to NHS Direct had not been reassuring, in each instance this reflected the fact that the participant had not been worried to begin with. One factor underlying the reassurance was the ability of staff to explicitly rule out swine flu. In addition, providing an alternative explanation for symptoms was mentioned as reassuring (e.g. \"I wanted to check that there were just other kinds of flu bugs going around, because it surprised me that at this time of year I should be having these sort of symptoms. So really I wanted somebody to say yes there are, they do last a few days, it's all perfectly normal\").\n\nHelping patients to understand that they were only at risk of catching swine flu if they had been in close contact with a known case was also reported as reassuring. For example, one participant was reassured after finding out that \"you definitely need to have had contact for a sustained period, i.e. over an hour,\" while another remembered being told that \"nobody in [my area] had been confirmed as contracting swine flu, so therefore the likelihood [that I had caught it] was probably extremely small.\" For other participants, it appeared that confusion still existed about their potential for having been exposed. For some, this emerged as only a minor nagging doubt. For others, it was a more central issue which diminished the reassurance that they had obtained. For example, one participant was unhappy that she had been asked if her family member had come into contact with a known case and commented that; \"well you don't know, that's the thing. They were very unhelpful... It just wasn't reassuring... They say you don't fit the criteria, but according to that list [of symptoms], you know, everything that she had is on that list.\"\n\nWhile factual aspects of their call relating to diagnoses or exposure were helpful for many patients, less tangible aspects relating to the credibility, expertise or professionalism of NHS Direct were also reported as reassuring. This was suggested by comments such as \"[I was] talking to someone who knew what they were talking about,\" \"it wasn't just a quick chat [but] I didn't feel like I was wasting their time,\" \"they were quite, what's the word, quite warm\" and \"[she] was the first person I spoke to that I felt I had any confidence in.\" Related to this, the simple action of telling the patient that they could call back if they had any additional concerns was explicitly cited as reassuring by some participants.\n\nNone of the participants were able to identify any aspect of their call that had caused them concern or worry.\n\nOnly one participant reported seeking additional advice about swine flu after speaking to NHS Direct. The employer of this participant had asked her to re-check the cause of her symptoms. She did this by speaking to NHS Direct again and by making an appointment with her GP.\n\nGiven the high workload of NHS Direct staff during our study, the most pragmatic way to obtain sufficient participants for our analysis was to ask call centre staff to recruit up to five participants each. This essentially provided us with a convenience sample. As such, we cannot provide any meaningful response rate for the study: it is not clear how many participants were asked to participate in the research, but declined. Nonetheless, we believe that the themes we identified do reflect the key variables that were important in causing people to seek advice from NHS Direct and to find their contact with NHS Direct reassuring or useful. We have no reason to believe that our sampling excluded a large subset of patients whose experiences or perceptions were qualitatively different from those who were included. Although we were unable to feed back our results to the initial callers in order to gauge their credibility, presentation of our results to an NHS Direct call centre team suggested that the issues we identified did appear to be complete, although it is possible that some small subgroups, such as pregnant women or GPs may have had different concerns when they called in.\n\nThe relative importance of each of the subthemes that we identified is less clear. Quantitative research with a more robust sampling strategy would be required to answer questions such as what proportion of patients contact the health services due to worry, what proportion obtain benefit from a discussion of how one can become exposed to a particular hazard, and what proportion remain concerned about a major public health incident despite receiving reassurance.\n\nWhether the sub-themes we identified are more generally applicable to other major incidents involving the release of a chemical, biological or radiological hazard, or whether they are specific to swine flu is also unclear. However, we have previously noted similar themes among members of the public who spoke to the Health Protection Agency following the dispersal of radioactive polonium 210 in central London in 2006 [14]. Additional research to identify the factors that motivate people to contact the health services during future incidents and the key aspects of that contact that help to reassure them is required.\n\nPeople who contacted NHS Direct about swine flu in the early stages of the outbreak had multiple reasons for doing so. Not all were anxious, while the majority of those who were gained reassurance from clear, factual information conveyed by a trusted source. For future major incidents in the UK, allowing existing services to provide initial telephone triage, advice and reassurance has much to recommend it.\n\nSL is a full-time employee of NHS Direct.
