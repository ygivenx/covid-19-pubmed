{"title": "The Renin Angiotensin System and the Metabolic Syndrome NIH Public Access Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript", "body": "The incidence of obesity and concomitant amplified susceptibility to cardiovascular disease and type-2 diabetes have reached epidemic proportions [1, 2] . As a consequence, it is vital to determine effective strategies to treat obesity and its co-morbidities, and accumulating evidence has implicated the renin angiotensin system (RAS; an endocrine system with critical roles in hydromineral balance and cardiovascular function) as a promising target in this regard [3] [4] [5] [6] . Hyperactivity of the RAS is associated with obesity and many obese individuals have high blood pressure. Angiotensin-II (A-II) is the active end-product of the RAS, and drugs that reduce A-II synthesis (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors) or action (angiotensin type-1 receptor blockers [ARBs]) have been effectively used to treat hypertension in such individuals for several decades. Relatively recently, the RAS has also gained the attention of researchers for its roles in various other aspects of the metabolic syndrome. For example, ACE inhibitors and ARBs have shown success in clinical trials investigating the utility of these drugs as therapeutics for patients with impaired glucose tolerance [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Although a role for this system in normal body weight regulation of humans is not entirely clear, many rodent studies suggest a prominent role of the RAS in the etiology of obesity. Peripheral administration of ACE inhibitors or ARBs, as well as genetic interference with the critical components of the RAS, prevents excessive weight gain in rodent models of obesity [3] [4] [5] [6] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . However, A-II exerts diverse effects on energy balance depending on the tissues accessed. As such, it is imperative to understand the specific role(s) of the RAS within the various A-II-sensitive tissues in order to determine the potential of targeting this system for the treatment of obesity. This review summarizes what is known of the actions of the RAS in the brain and throughout the body to influence various metabolic disorders. We begin by briefly reviewing the classical endocrine roles of the RAS, and then we provide a general overview of the RAS involvement in insulin sensitivity. Subsequently, we review the tissue-specific actions of the RAS in relation to glucose and energy homeostasis. Special emphasis is given to the body weight regulatory role of the RAS within adipose tissue and brain.\n\nThe renin angiotensin system (RAS) is best known for its critical roles in the regulation of hydromineral balance and cardiovascular function, and the involvement of the RAS in these homeostatic processes has been studied extensively (for review see [19] ). Most of the physiological actions of the RAS are exerted by the effector peptide, A-II, which is formed from angiotensinogen through a series of proteolytic cleavage events (Figure 1 ). In the classically described or systemic RAS, angiotensinogen is synthesized primarily in the liver and secreted into the circulation where it is cleaved by renin, a circulating enzyme whose synthesis and secretion from the kidney are rate-limiting for A-II synthesis, to yield angiotensin-I (A-I). A-I is then processed by ACE (mainly from the lung) into A-II, which exerts physiological effects on several tissues including adrenal cortex, kidney, vascular smooth muscle and brain. Upon synthesis, A-II either binds to its receptors in these target areas or is cleaved further to yield degradation products, and some of these are themselves other biologically active peptides including the recently described angiotensin (1-7) [20] [21] [22] , as well as angiotensin-III and angiotensin-IV, which influence many processes such as learning and memory [23] .\n\nA-II receptors (angiotensin type-1 receptor [AT 1 ] and angiotensin type-2 receptor [AT 2 ]) are G-protein-coupled receptors. In rodents, AT 1 can be further partitioned into AT 1 a and AT 1 b based on a few amino-acid differences and are the target of most of the known physiologic actions of A-II, such as vasoconstriction and the induction of sodium and water consumption. Conversely, AT 2 activation antagonizes AT 1 activation in many aspects [24] . Acting at its receptors, A-II triggers a number of intracellular signal transduction pathways, such as Gprotein-mediated (Gq and Gi), JAK/STAT, and MAPK or ERK intracellular signaling cascades [25, 26] and many of the classical roles of the RAS have been attributed to the activation of one or more of these signaling cascades [27] . Several of these same signaling pathways are also involved in the actions of various cytokines and other metabolic hormones such as insulin.\n\nOne relatively recent nuance regarding the RAS is that in addition to the classically-described endocrine arm of the RAS, all of the critical components necessary to synthesize A-II locally are also expressed in other tissues, including pancreas, brain and adipose, suggesting that aside from the classical endocrine functions, there also exist tissue-specific RASs that can exert autocrine and paracrine actions (for a review see [28] ). In the brain, the RAS generates local A-II that acts as a neurotransmitter [29] . In adipose tissue, A-II is synthesized locally, in part to promote adipocyte growth [30] . Another nuance is an increased recognition of the complexity of the active end-products of the RAS (Figure 2 ). For example, there is a (pro)renin receptor that binds renin as well as its precursor, prorenin. Upon binding to this receptor, prorenin activates intracellular signaling cascades and is itself also activated, allowing for the conversion of A-I to A-II [31] . It has been proposed that the (pro)renin receptor plays an integral role in certain tissue-specific RASs, such as the one in the brain [31] [32] [33] . A second angiotensin converting enzyme, called ACE2, was identified in 2000 [22, 34] . ACE2 is a membrane-bound carboxy-peptidase expressed in numerous tissues throughout the body that can be cleaved from the membrane by tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 convertase (TACE or ADAM17) [35, 36] . ACE2 converts the octapeptide A-II into the septapeptide angiotensin (1-7) which does not activate AT 1 or AT 2 and rather acts at the G-protein-coupled receptor, Mas [21] . Activation of this receptor promotes the release of nitric oxide through a phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Aktdependent pathway, ultimately resulting in vasodilation and inhibition of cell growth, in apparent opposition to A-II's vasoconstrictive and proliferative effects [21, 37] . There are also a number of alternative enzymes for A-II production, and a number of these non-traditional RAS components have integral roles in regulating energy, glucose and cardiovascular homeostasis as discussed below.\n\nIn addition to the exacerbation of hypertension, the RAS has been implicated in the etiology of obesity and insulin resistance, providing perhaps a pivotal link among obesity, diabetes and hypertension [38] [39] [40] , all symptoms of the metabolic syndrome. A-II is generally thought to decrease insulin sensitivity and several mechanisms have been proposed for this, as well as for the insulin-sensitizing actions of ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Essential hypertension, a key feature of which is high RAS activity, is oftentimes associated with insulin resistance [41] . A-II is a potent and well-known vasoconstrictor and variations in blood flow are a substantial factor in the control of insulin-mediated glucose uptake [42, 43] . As such, an increase in vasodilation consequent to the administration of an ACE inhibitor or an ARB could secondarily result in increased glucose uptake. Nevertheless, multiple lines of evidence indicate that inhibition of the RAS improves insulin sensitivity independent of changes in blood pressure [8, 13, 15, 44] . For instance, relative to patients using \u03b2-blockers to promote vasodilation and reduce hypertension, individuals using ACE inhibitors that result in a comparable reduction of blood pressure have a lower risk of developing new-onset diabetes [8] . In fact, \u03b2-blockers increase the risk of diabetes [45, 46] , implying that the insulin-sensitizing effects of RAS inhibition are independent of blood pressure.\n\nThere is also substantial cross-talk between the insulin and A-II signaling cascades, offering a potential mechanism for A-II to impair insulin sensitivity [26, 44] . Other proposed mechanisms for A-II to reduce insulin sensitivity include decreasing adiponectin [47] , decreasing adipogenesis [48] , inhibiting GLUT4 translocation [15, 49] , increasing reactive oxygen species [49] , increasing inflammation [49] and increasing ectopic fat storage [50] .\n\nWhen obese individuals lose weight, both adipose tissue mass and systemic RAS activity are reduced [51, 52] . While such findings are correlative, both pharmacological and genetic manipulations of the RAS in rodents have provided substantial evidence supporting a causal role of the RAS in body weight regulation. Systemic administration of ACE inhibitors or ARBs, as well as interference with any of the key RAS components (i.e., angiotensinogen, renin, ACE, AT 1 a and AT 2 ) via a whole-body knock-out, leads to a leaner phenotype [4, 5, 9, [16] [17] [18] 53] . Several mechanisms have been proposed for this decrease in adiposity (Table 1) . For instance, some of these manipulations lead to elevations in energy expenditure and/or locomotor activity, while others cause adipocyte hypotrophy and/or reduce food intake. In contrast, procedures that reduce activity of the counter-regulatory ACE2-Angiotensin (1-7)-Mas axis result in an opposite metabolic profile [54] . Specifically, mice lacking the Mas receptor, which is activated by angiotensin (1-7) and whose actions oppose traditional A-II receptor activation, have increased abdominal fat mass, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance and reduced insulin sensitivity [54] . Nonetheless, the role of A-II in body weight regulation is far from clear.\n\nAlthough a plethora of evidence indicates that drugs that inhibit A-II synthesis or action are beneficial for the treatment of obesity, selectively elevating brain A-II has been reported to reduce body weight [55, 56] . In fact, A-II is thought to contribute to the cachexia that accompanies chronic heart failure and cancer [57, 58] , and elevations in central A-II underlie the decreased food intake consequent to the administration of an ACE inhibitor that does not access the brain [3] . Consistent with these seemingly paradoxical findings, we have hypothesized that A-II can exert diverse actions depending on the specific tissues it stimulates, the level of activation and/or the physiological state of the animal [3] . In other words, A-II's influence on the neural regulation of energy balance may differ dramatically from its adipocytespecific role in energy storage. Moreover, whether or not the RAS may facilitate or reduce energy storage may depend on the level of RAS activity. When the level of RAS activation is very high, as occurs during chronic heart failure, perhaps A-II acts on different tissues than when there is a modest increase in RAS activity, such as what occurs during the development of obesity. Accordingly, unraveling the role of the RAS in body weight regulation will require gaining an understanding of the differential roles of the endocrine RAS relative to the autocrine and paracrine roles of the locally-acting RAS in several A-II-sensitive tissues ( Figure 3 ).\n\nIn addition to serving as a storage center for surplus energy, white adipose tissue (WAT) is now known to be an important endocrine tissue, secreting numerous factors collectively known as adipokines [59] . Importantly, as fat accumulates and obesity develops, the secretion of many of these adipokines increases [59] , and several of these factors have been implicated in obesityrelated complications. White adipose tissue also expresses all of the critical elements of the traditional RAS (i.e., angiotensinogen, renin, ACE, AT 1 and AT 2 ) and is a predominant source of circulating angiotensinogen [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] . WAT therefore can generate local A-II to stimulate AT 1 and AT 2 on adipocytes and other cells within adipose tissue and contribute to A-II activity on more distant tissues. ACE2 and the Mas receptor are also expressed in adipocytes, suggesting that the ACE2-Angiotensin (1-7)-Mas receptor axis may also be important in adipocyte physiology [54, 66] .\n\nIn humans as well as in animal models, systemic RAS activity is positively correlated with body weight and more specifically with body fat, and weight loss is associated with decreased RAS activity both systemically and in WAT [38, 52, [67] [68] [69] . The increase in adipose tissue angiotensinogen has been reported for diet-induced obesity [38, 67] as well as for several genetic models of obesity including leptin deficiency [70] and over-expression of 11 \u03b2hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type-1 (11\u03b2HSD1) in adipose tissue [71, 72] . Additionally, adipocyte angiotensinogen expression and the local synthesis and secretion of A-II change in response to factors that regulate adipocyte metabolism, such as nutritional status [70, 73, 74] . Fasting decreases, while re-feeding, hyperglycemia and fatty acids all increase adipose tissue and systemic angiotensinogen levels [70, 73, 74] . Insulin also influences RAS activity; however, some reports suggest it upregulates [75, 76] and others that it downregulates adipose tissuederived angiotensinogen [77] . ACE2 is also nutritionally regulated, with maintenance on a high-fat diet resulting in increased ACE2 expression and activity [66] . This sensitivity of the WAT RAS activity to changes in body weight and nutritional status suggests that adipose tissue A-II may contribute to adipocyte metabolism.\n\nAdipocyte Growth-WAT RAS also contributes to adipocyte growth. A-II increases the activities of the enzymes that promote lipogenesis (glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and fatty acid synthase [FAS]) [78] and also increases triglyceride content of cultured 3T3-L1 and human adipocytes, leading to adipocyte hypertrophy [79] . The A-II-induced increase in FAS activity is dependent on glucose and occurs via an angiotensin-responsive element which is identical to the insulin-responsive element in the FAS promoter [80] , suggesting that A-II and insulin stimulate adipocyte lipogenesis via common mechanisms [80] . Consistent with this, mice lacking either angiotensinogen or renin exhibit adipocyte hypotrophy [5, 16] , and this is reversed by A-II administration [16] . Conversely, transgenic over-expression of angiotensinogen specifically in WAT renders mice susceptible to diet-induced obesity characterized by increased fat cell size. Mice lacking angiotensinogen have reduced adipose FAS activity [5] , while those with increased angiotensinogen in WAT have elevated adipose FAS and sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) expression in addition to increased inflammatory and angiogenic markers [81] . Pharmacological interference of A-II production with ACE inhibitors also decreases body fat either independent of reductions of food intake [82] or to a greater extent than occurs in pair-fed controls [3] . Because this procedure results in adipocyte hypotrophy, the implication is that A-II has a trophic role in adipose tissue [83] .\n\nThere is also evidence that both AT 1 and AT 2 are involved in adipocyte metabolism. Genetic AT 1 a deficiency or AT 1 antagonism using an ARB yields adipose tissue hypotrophy, implying that the AT 1 is key to many of the effects of A-II on adipocyte function [83, 84] . Moreover, AT 2 deficient mice are protected from the development of diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance and hypertension and exhibit adipocyte hypotrophy despite an increased number of adipocytes (i.e., there are more but smaller adipocytes) [18] . Hence, both AT 1 and AT 2 contribute to promoting adipocyte hypertrophy. Similar to angiotensinogen-deficient mice, mice lacking AT 2 have decreased lipogenic factors (FAS and SREBP-1c) as well as decreased indicators of lipid metabolism (lipoprotein lipase [LPL] and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 [PPAR\u03b3]) [18] .\n\nAdipogenesis-Activation of AT 1 promotes proliferation in a variety of cell types and antagonizing AT 1 activity is a treatment strategy for inhibiting tumor growth [85, 86] . In human preadipocytes, gene expression of the RAS components is upregulated during differentiation [87, 88] . Consistent with this, A-II acts at AT 1 , to stimulate the progression of the cell cycle in quiescent preadipocytes [89] and at AT 2 to stimulate the release of prostacyclin from adipocytes, thereby triggering the differentiation of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes [90, 91] . A-II also stimulates the expression of the transcription factor, adipocyte differentiation determination-dependent factor-1 [80] , which is involved in adipocyte differentiation. Pharmacological interference with AT 1 , using irbesartan, reduces adipocyte differentiation [92] .\n\nNot all of the findings are consistent. The phenotypes of mice with genetic RAS manipulations suggest an inhibitory role for A-II in adipogenesis [5, 18] . Mice with increased angiotensinogen in fat exhibit adipocyte hypertrophy and hypoplasia (i.e., the adipocytes are larger, but there are fewer of them), suggesting that A-II is a trophic factor rather than an adipogenic factor [30] . Additionally, AT 2 -deficient mice have an increased number of small adipocytes, consistent with A-II promoting lipogensis and inhibiting adipocyte differentiation via the AT 2 [18] . However, deletion of AT 2 increases binding to AT 1 a, suggesting that AT 2 KO animals may have increased adipocyte proliferation due to increased AT 1 a binding. The ability of A-II to inhibit adipogenesis is reversed by AT 1 blockade [88] . However, interpretations from AT 1 antagonism studies should be considered with care as there are a number of ARBs (e.g., irbesartan, telmisartan) that are partial PPAR\u03b3 agonists and PPAR\u03b3 plays an integral role in adipose differentiation and physiology [93, 94] . Accordingly, a number of these ARBs are thought to induce adipocyte differentiation through PPAR\u03b3 activation [94] . Moreover, mice lacking AT 1 a have normal adipocyte differentiation [17] .\n\nIn sum, the precise role of A-II in adipocyte differentiation and proliferation is somewhat controversial owing to the variety of experimental conditions and cell-types utilized in the experiments discussed. Perhaps these discrepancies can be explained by species or strain differences, or by differences in in vivo vs. in vitro conditions. Nonetheless, if A-II does inhibit adipogenesis, this could be a contributing mechanism for A-II's ability to impair insulin sensitivity. In fact, it has been hypothesized that A-II contributes to blunted insulin sensitivity by decreasing the number of small adipocytes and increasing the number of large adipocytes [48] . Consistent with this, the increase in small adipocytes in AT 2 -deficient mice could provide a contributing mechanism for the improved insulin sensitivity, and perhaps play an important role in the influence of A-II on insulin sensitivity [18] .\n\nAdipose Tissue Inflammation and Angiogenesis-A-II is both proinflammatory and angiogenic, and key features of obesity are increased inflammation in adipose tissue and an expanded blood supply that parallels the expansion of adipose tissue. Moreover, A-II-enhanced inflammation could contribute to A-II's insulin desensitizing action. Mice with elevated adipocyte angiotensinogen have increased expression of the proinflammatory cytokines, TNF\u03b1, IL-6 and IL1\u03b2 as well as increased VEGF in adipose tissue, indicative of increased local inflammation and angiogenesis [30, 81] . These increases are significantly attenuated in mice that over-express angiotensinogen in adipose tissue and that also lack AT 2 [81] . Additionally, AT 1 a-deficient mice have decreased inflammation in adipose tissue when on a high-fat diet [17] , implying that both receptors are involved.\n\nStudies examining the role of the RAS in cancer (reviewed in [95] ) have determined the angiogenic potential of A-II. ACE inhibition (i.e., captopril or lisonpril) or AT 1 a blockade (TCV-116; candesartan) suppress tumor angiogenesis and growth [96, 97] . Additionally, genetic AT 1 a deficiency and pharmacological AT 1 blockade reduces ischemia-induced angiogenesis [98] . This is of importance because, much like tumors, in order for adipose tissue to expand, angiogenesis must occur and factors that inhibit angiogenesis also inhibit adipose tissue expansion [99, 100] .\n\nThe endocrine role of the adipose RAS-In addition to its local autocrine/paracrine roles in energy metabolism and glucose homeostasis, A-II released from adipose tissue has broader actions. The A-II can enter the blood and contribute to systemic A-II action, and it can modulate adipokine and cytokine secretion from adipocytes, macrophages and other cells found in adipose tissue. For example, A-II increases the secretion of leptin [101] and decreases the secretion of adiponectin [47] . Adiponectin, an adipokine that circulates in the plasma at high levels and is inversely correlated with body fat, increases insulin sensitivity by several mechanisms including augmentation of tissue fat oxidation, suppressing hepatic glucose output and increasing muscular glucose utilization (reviewed in [102] ). A-II, at doses that do not alter body weight, causes significant reduction in adiponectin release from adipocytes, possibly contributing to A-II's insulin-desensitizing effects [47] . Adiponectin gene expression is unchanged in response to A-II suggesting that the mechanism maybe posttranscriptional [47, 48, 78] . Mice lacking renin have a deficit in A-II and increased adiponectin, and the latter is reversed by A-II administration [16] . Additionally, mice lacking AT 2 fail to decrease adiponectin on a high-fat diet [18] .\n\nThe spillover into the blood of adipose tissue-derived A-II contributes to obesity-induced hypertension and cardiovascular dysfunction [30] . Accordingly, mice over-expressing angiotensinogen in adipose tissue have increased circulating angiotensinogen and elevated blood pressure [30] . When the AT 2 gene is also knocked out in these adipose angiotensinogen over-expressing mice, the increased susceptibility to diet-induced obesity is blunted. However, the hypertensive phenotype is exacerbated and likely due to elevated renin production from the kidney and increased AT 1 binding within the vasculature, indicating that although AT 2 contributes to diet-induced weight gain, it is not responsible for obesity-related hypertension in this model.\n\nBrown adipose tissue (BAT) also expresses all of the critical components of the RAS and produces A-II [61, 65, 103] , and BAT A-II is up-regulated in adult rats [104] . Systemic A-II infusion facilitates sympathetic neurotransmission to interscapular BAT and increases regional surface temperature in rats [105] , consistent with A-II enhancing thermogenesis [106] . This is likely due to the activation of AT 1 on presynaptic sympathetic nerve terminals in BAT and the consequent promotion of norepinephrine release [107] . A-II also plays a role in cold-induced thermogenesis [108] . Cold exposure increases both BAT and plasma A-II [108] as well as BAT A-II receptor binding and these are independent of changes in food intake [109] .\n\nThe liver is responsible for up to one-third of normal glucose disposal and hepatic glucose production is a key contributor to maintaining adequate levels of glucose. The liver is also the primary site for synthesis of circulating angiotensinogen, and there is evidence for a local RAS within the liver [110] . Hepatic angiotensinogen expression is elevated in patients with type-2 diabetes and there is some evidence that body weight also modulates RAS in the liver [44, 111] . The ACE inhibitor, captopril, suppresses hepatic glucose production and increases hepatic glucose uptake in response to insulin infusion [112] . Additionally, chronic treatment with the ARB, irbesartan, restores hepatic intracellular insulin signaling in obese Zucker rats [44] .\n\nThe RAS also influences fatty acid metabolism in the liver via activation of AT 1 or AT 2 . A-II infusion stimulates hepatic triglyceride production via AT 2 and thus secondarily contributes to insulin resistance [113, 114] . A-II activation of AT 2 is associated with increased free fatty acids (FFAs), resulting in increased FFA flux to the liver and hence increased triglycerides. Olmesartan, an ARB that is not a PPAR\u03b3 agonist, ameliorates triglyceride overproduction in fatty Zucker rats [115] . Similarly, AT 1 -deficient mice have reduced liver TGs and are resistant to steatohepatitis [116] , and ACE-deficient mice have increased hepatic expression of genes involved in lipolysis (lipoprotein lipase and hormone sensitive lipase), fatty acid oxidation (carnitine palmitoyl transferase and long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase) and fat storage (FAS) [4] .\n\nSkeletal muscle is of particular importance for normal glucose homeostasis as it is responsible for the bulk of insulin-mediated glucose disposal. A-II reduces insulin signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells [117] , and several lines of evidence indicate that A-II also induces skeletal muscle insulin resistance [15, 49, 50] . Rats with transgenic renin overexpression have elevated tissue RAS activity and exhibit increased skeletal muscle triglyceride content and impaired skeletal muscle intracellular insulin signal transduction [50] . Antagonism of AT 1 using valsartan enhances insulin sensitivity in the skeletal muscle of genetically type-2 diabetic mice [15] . Conversely, in that same study, skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity was not influenced by the AT 2 antagonist PD123319 or in AT 2 -null mice implying that this effect is specific to the AT 1 [15] . Nonetheless, AT 2 -deficient mice have decreased skeletal muscle triglyceride content, elevated beta-oxidation capacity and improved whole-body insulin sensitivity when maintained on a high-fat diet [18] .\n\nThere is evidence suggesting that A-II is catabolic to skeletal muscle. A-II increases the expression of the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway and directly inhibits protein synthesis and stimulates protein degradation in myotube cultures [58, 118] . Additionally, A-II has been implicated in cancer and congestive heart failure cachexia which is characterized by adipose and muscle wasting [57, 58] . Consistent with this, treatment of chronic heart failure patients with the ACE inhibitor, enalapril, prevents weight loss [57] .\n\nLocal RASs have also been found in heart, vasculature and pancreas and in the reproductive and digestive systems (see review in [28] ). Within the pancreas, the RAS components have been identified in both the endocrine and exocrine pancreas [119] [120] [121] [122] . AT 1 are limited to the \u03b2-cell, and are up-regulated in type-2 diabetes [123, 124] . A-II decreases islet perfusion and interferes with insulin biosynthesis and secretion [123] [124] [125] . Blockade of AT 1 improves \u03b2-cell function and glucose tolerance in a rodent models of type-2 diabetes [126] [127] [128] . Some proposed mechanisms for these improvements include enhanced (pro)insulin biosynthesis and increased islet blood flow [129] as well as reductions in oxidative stress [127] [128] [129] .\n\nIsolated enterocytes of the jejunum and ileum express AT 1 , AT 2 , angiotensinogen and ACE mRNA and protein [130] , with a slightly higher level of AT 1 , AT 2 and angiotensinogen in the ileal cells and a 3.5-fold higher level of ACE in jejunal cells [130] . Moreover, in a comprehensive study describing the expression patterns of ACE2 throughout various tissues of mice and rats, the highest level of ACE2 expression was found in the ileum, implying that the counterregulatory angiotensin (1-7) may play a role in that part of the intestine. RAS components are also expressed in isolated brush border membrane [130] . AT 1 is located along the entire villus length at the brush border and basolateral membrane. Streptozotocin-induced diabetes is associated with reduced AT 1 , AT 2 and ACE and upregulated AGT in the jejunum [131] . In the jejunum, activation of AT 1 reduces the expression of the sodium-dependent glucose transporter and inhibits glucose, but not L-leucine uptake [130] . Conversely, AT 1 antagonism augments ileal glucose uptake, implying a luminal secretion of A-II in the distal small intestine [130] . The RAS may be important in dietary fat absorption. A-II stimulates pancreatic lipase [132] . Mice lacking renin, which have deficits in both the traditional RAS and in the counterregulatory ACE2-Angiotensin (1-7)-Mas axis, have decreased pancreatic lipase and colipase expression as well as decreased dietary fat absorption [16] . However, angiotensinogen-deficient and ACE-deficient mice have normal fat absorption [4, 5] .\n\nThe RAS influences a variety of peripheral tissues involved in glucose and energy homeostasis ( Figure 3 ). With regard to energy storage, the RAS facilitates the expansion of WAT by elevating FAS activity, promoting adipocyte hypertrophy via its proinflammatory and proangiogenic actions [5, 16, 17, 30, 79, 81, 83, 96] . Additionally, there is evidence that the RAS promotes fat absorption through its actions within the gastrointestinal tract [16] and ectopic fat storage through its actions within liver and muscle [50, 113, 115, 116] ]. Collectively, these results suggest that the RAS acts peripherally to promote energy storage. However, there is also evidence that the RAS promotes BAT thermogenesis via activation of the sympathetic nervous system, which opposes the other peripheral actions of the RAS [107] .\n\nWith regard to glucose homeostasis, the pancreatic RAS is involved in insulin secretion [127] [128] [129] . The pancreatic RAS negatively impacts islet blood flow and promotes oxidative stress, thereby reducing insulin secretion [127] [128] [129] . Additionally, there is evidence that the RAS within the gastrointestinal tract inhibits glucose uptake [130, 131] and that the liver and muscle RASs decrease insulin sensitivity [49, 50, 112] . Lastly, the WAT RAS blunts the secretion of the insulin-sensitizing adipokine, adiponectin [47] . The implication is that the RAS has a net negative impact on insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis.\n\nThe amount of food individuals consume varies from person to person and from meal to meal. Nevertheless, most animals and humans are capable of effectively matching energy consumption to energy expenditure with great precision in order to defend a particular level of adiposity [133] [134] [135] . The central nervous system (CNS) plays an integral role in maintaining this balance as it receives and integrates peripheral signals regarding the status of energy stores, such as body fat, and responds to these signals thereby maintaining a certain level of adiposity [133] [134] [135] . Despite the accuracy of this centrally-mediated system, physiologic disruptions, such as chronic high-fat feeding or stress, often shift the homeostatic system to defend a higher or lower level of adiposity. Numerous neuropeptides and other factors influence energy balance by acting directly in the CNS, and accumulating evidence implicates the RAS in this process [3, 55, 134] .\n\nA-II can influence the CNS via the circulation, activating receptors in the circumventricular organs and as a neurotransmitter produced by the local brain RAS [29, 136] . \\ Moreover, activity of the systemic and central RASs are intricately related since activation of AT 1 in circumventricular organs stimulates neural circuits that use A-II as a neurotransmitter [29] . Angiotensinogen is expressed in neurons and in glia in several brain areas, with a particular abundance in the hypothalamus [137, 138] . Female brains have far more angiotensinogenpositive neurons than those in males [138] . Renin, ACE, and ACE2 are also expressed in brain [139] [140] [141] [142] [143] . However, the level of renin is low and it is questionable as to whether the level is of functional significance [143] . Conversely, the (pro)renin receptor is highly expressed in the CNS [31] and may mediate brain RAS activity (for a review see [32] ). AT 1 a is expressed in brain regions involved in hydromineral balance, neuroendocrine control and cardiovascular function, including the subfornical organ (SFO) and various nuclei of the hypothalamus and brainstem [144] , and A-II induces c-Fos in many of these regions [145, 146] . AT 2 is expressed in a number of limbic and thalamic regions [144] .\n\nWith regard to energy homeostasis, angiotensinogen and A-II receptors are expressed in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) [137, 138, 144, 147, 148] , a region generally accepted as an integrative site for CNS control over energy homeostasis; it receives afferent input from circulating adiposity signals and transduces this information into signals influencing food intake and energy expenditure [135] . The ARC contains neurons that co-express the orexigenic peptides neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP), as well as other neurons expressing the anorexigenic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) [135] . Although AT 1 a is expressed in the ARC, the levels are relatively low and elevations in central A-II do not result in decreased orexigenic and increased anorexigenic peptide expression in the ARC, which is thought to underlie the anorectic actions of many the traditional adiposity signals. Nonetheless, ARC neurons project to other hypothalamic areas involved in energy homeostasis, including the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and the perifornical area (PFA), all of which highly express AT 1 a [133, 144] .\n\nIn the PVN, AT 1 a is expressed by corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH)-secreting parvicellular neurons [144] and A-II upregulates CRH expression [149, 150] . CRH in turn decreases food intake and increases energy expenditure and fasting reduces CRH gene expression. PVN neurons also project back to the ARC as well as to several brain areas that modulate sympathetic tone and energy expenditure [151] [152] [153] . The inference is that A-II likely contributes to the central regulation of energy balance.\n\nThat said, the precise influence of the RAS on energy balance remains somewhat controversial, as both inhibition through systemic administration of certain hydrophilic ACE inhibitors and activation of the system by central and/or peripheral administration of A-II lead to hypophagia [6, 14, 55, 56, 105 ]. An explanation for these seemingly contradictory findings is that certain hydrophilic ACE inhibitors cannot readily cross the blood-brain-barrier [154, 155] . Hence, they inhibit the conversion of A-I to A-II in the periphery but not in the brain, resulting in elevated circulating A-I; the elevated plasma A-I is converted to A-II within the brain since brain ACE is not impacted by the hydrophilic ACE inhibitors. As a consequence, treatment with these ACE inhibitors results in reduced peripheral A-II action but increased brain A-II action [154, 155] . We have determined that systemic administration of captopril, an ACE inhibitor that decreases RAS activity in the periphery, reduces food intake and body weight in rats [3] .\n\nSystemic captopril elevates plasma and consequently brain A-I, but does not itself enter the brain. The still-active brain ACE is then able to convert the increased A-I to A-II, and the increased brain A-II causes negative energy balance. Consistent with this, the reduction in food intake elicited by peripheral captopril is reversed by co-administration of the ACE inhibitor into the brain [3] .\n\nFurther supporting a role for brain A-II in promoting negative energy balance, direct intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of A-II reduces food intake in rats ( [55, 56] and unpublished results), and rats with decreased central RAS activity exhibit hyperphagia [156] . The reduction in body weight secondary to icv A-II results from both hypophagia and increased energy expenditure ( [55, 56] and unpublished results), the latter due to augmented sympathetic activity. When administered icv, A-II also prevents a decrease in BAT uncoupling protein-1, an indicator of thermogenesis, which otherwise occurs as animals lose weight ( [55, 56] and unpublished results), again consistent with central A-II promoting increased sympathetic activity and energy expenditure.\n\nMice with genetically knocked-out components of the RAS are lean, and in some cases hyperphagic, consistent with a peripheral role of the RAS in promoting energy storage and also with a potential central role of the RAS in promoting negative energy balance. The apparent divergence between the brain-and adipose-specific effects of the RAS on energy balance suggests the presence of a negative feedback system that is activated when adipose angiotensinogen levels are high, allowing A-II from adipose to enter circulation and gain access to the CNS, providing a brake on peripheral A-II action. This is strikingly similar to actions of leptin and insulin. These two widely accepted adiposity signals become elevated in obesity and also act on the ARC in a negative feed-back manner to reduce energy storage. Although the end-point is essentially the same (i.e., insulin, leptin and A-II all act centrally to promote negative energy balance), the neural circuits and molecular mechanisms underlying the anorexigenic influence of A-II likely differ from those of leptin and insulin. Elevations in central A-II do not result in decreases in AgRP and NPY or elevations in POMC within the ARC, which is thought to underlie the actions of many the traditional adiposity signals. Rather, it results in a seemingly opposite neuropeptide profile, consistent with a compensatory response to the energy deficit. Nonetheless, A-II receptors are neuroanatomically located in brain regions heavily implicated in energy balance regulation, as well as in circumventricular organs that have direct projections to these regions, such as the subfornical organ, allowing the brain to effectively monitor and respond to the A-II levels in the circulation. Further research must be conducted in order to discern underlying mechanism(s) of A-II influence on the central control of energy balance.\n\nSeveral lines of evidence implicate the RAS not only in the etiology of hypertension but also in the development of obesity and insulin resistance, providing a potential causal link among these co-morbidities of the metabolic syndrome. In rodents, pharmacological or genetic disruption of RAS action prevents weight-gain, promotes insulin sensitivity and relieves hypertension, implying that the administration of ACE inhibitors or ARBs may present an effective treatment for the metabolic syndrome in humans. However, although ACE inhibitors and ARBs are widely used as antihypertensive agents and are beginning to be used to promote insulin sensitivity in humans, there is minimal evidence that these agents are effective clinically to treat obesity. Nonetheless, this does not rule out the RAS as a potential target for treating obesity. The traditional view of the RAS functioning primarily as an endocrine system with one effector peptide (A-II) has become somewhat antiquated, as the RAS is far more complicated than once thought. First of all, A-II is synthesized locally in various tissue types, in which it exerts diverse effects on energy balance. As a consequence, understanding the functions of the RAS within A-II-sensitive tissues is imperative for determining the viability of targeting the RAS for obesity therapy. Perhaps, selectively activating or inhibiting the RAS within specific tissues will improve the efficacy of targeting this system to treat obesity. Moreover, there are additional active angiotensin peptides, such as angiotensin (1-7) and angiotensin-IV, which act at distinct receptors and may also influence energy balance. Determining the role(s) of such peptides may also aid in understanding the therapeutic potential of targeting this system for the treatment of obesity and its co-morbidities.\n\nA-II is formed from liver-synthesized angiotensinogen via a series of proteolytic cleavage events. Angiotensinogen is first cleaved by the rate-limiting enzyme renin (formed in and secreted from the kidney) into A-I. A-I is then processed by ACE (from the lung) into A-II. Circulating A-II activates AT 1 and AT 2 receptors in various tissues, such as the brain, adrenal and vascular tissue to modulate cardiovascular and hydromineral homeostasis. In addition to the classical enzymatic cascade for A-II synthesis, there are several alternative pathways for A-II synthesis. Binding of prorenin to the (pro)renin receptor activates intracellular signaling pathways and also allows for the conversion of angiotensinogen to A-I by the prorenin/(pro)renin receptor complex. There are also alternative active angiotensin peptides, including angiotensin (1-7) and angiotensin-IV that are formed by other enzymes. These peptides activate the Mas and angiotensin type-4 (AT 4 ; insulin-regulated aminopetidase [IRAP]) receptors, respectively.\n\nThese tissues also contain local RASs, indicating that A-II's influence may be autocrine, paracrine or endocrine.
