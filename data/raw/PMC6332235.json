{"title": "Phosphonylated Acyclic Guanosine Analogues with the 1,2,3-Triazole Linker", "body": "An effective treatment for viral infections is one of the most difficult goals of contemporary medicine. The discovery of acyclic nucleosides/nucleotides, which act as antimetabolites, had a significant impact on the progress in the therapy of viral infections [1,2]. Among them, adefovir is active against DNA viruses and retroviruses [3,4,5], whereas tenofovir exhibits high potency and selectivity against HIV-1 and HIV-2 viruses and hepatitis B virus [6,7]. Ganciclovir [8,9,10] and its prodrug with improved oral bioavailability, valganciclovir [11,12], are used for the treatment of cytomegalovirus infections. Cidofovir [5,13,14] shows activity against herpes viruses, including cytomegalovirus, as well as adeno- and pox-viruses. The specificity of the antiviral activity of the compounds already known strongly depends on the structural features of the aliphatic chain installed as a sugar ring replacer, whereas a choice of nucleobases is mostly limited to adenine, guanine and 2,6-diaminopurine. Various guanine-containing analogues of nucleosides have been reported as potent antiviral agents (Figure 1) [15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30]. Moreover, acyclic analogues of nucleotides having guanine and hypoxanthine as a nucleobase with antimalarial activity have also been reported [26,31]. Phosphorylation of nucleosides and their structural analogues is inefficient, and at the same time, it appears to be one of the most important steps with implications on their activity, since the first step of phosphorylation is carried out by viral kinases. Therefore, several nucleotide analogues have been designed by incorporation of a phosphonate residue ((RO)2P(O)\u2013CH2\u2013) instead of a phosphate group ((RO)2P(O)\u2013O\u2013C(5\u2032)) to avoid the first phosphorylation step and to ensure the stability of phosphonates to enzymatic hydrolysis [32,33,34,35].\n\nIn recent years, analogues of nucleotides containing various modifications of an acyclic fragment have been widely studied. Among them, extended linkers, including a 1,2,3-triazole moiety, were synthesized [36,37,38,39,40], and several compounds with promising anticancer (1\u20133) [38] and antiviral (3\u20138) [37,38,39] properties were found. Although various canonical nucleobases and their mimetics were applied, only a few acyclic guanosine, as well as 2-amino-6-chloropurine analogues containing the 1,2,3-triazole linker (9\u201313) have been obtained so far (Figure 2) [36,40,41,42,43]; however, among them, only Compound 13 was tested and revealed inhibitory activity against thymidine phosphorylase [40].\n\nAs a continuation of our ongoing project directed towards biologically-active acyclic analogues of nucleotides with the 1,2,3-triazole linker, a new series of analogues 16 and 17 containing 2-amino-6-chloropurine and guanine as nucleobases has been designed to study their antiviral and cytostatic properties. To install a guanine moiety at C4 in the 1,2,3-triazole ring, two strategies were used. The dipolar cycloaddition of the respective azidoalkylphosphonates 14 to propargylated guanines should directly lead to Compound 15 or 16 [41,42,43], whereas application of 2-amino-6-chloro-9-propargylpurine as dipolarophile in the reaction with azides 14 should produce Compound 17 to be subsequently transformed into 16 [40,44,45,46,47] (Scheme 1).\n\nGenerally, in order to secure sufficient bioavailability of active phosphonate nucleotide analogues, they are administered as prodrugs, namely the respective phosphonate esters or amides [33,34,35,48,49,50,51,52,53]. For this reason, we designed guanosine analogues 16 and 17 as the respective phosphonate esters to ensure sufficient membrane permeability. Moreover, our recent experiences clearly supported the strategy to prepare diesters rather than free phosphonic acids, which are completely ionized at physiological pH. Indeed, we found several examples of active diesters in the class of 1,2,3-triazole phosphonates, whereas the respective free acids appeared inactive [38,39,54].\n\nPropargylated 2-amino-6-chloropurine 19 [29,36,40,45,55], guanine 18a [29,44,45,46,47,55] and N2-acetylguanine 18b [42,43,56], as well as all azidoalkylphosphonates 14a\u2013k [37,38,57,58,59,60,61,62] are known compounds and were obtained according to the literature procedures.\n\nAlthough cycloadditions of propargylated guanines 18a (R = H) and 18b (R = Ac) to various azides have previously been mentioned [41,42,43], in our hands, the reaction of 18a, as well as 18b with the azidomethylphosphonate 14a failed because of the low solubility of guanines 18a and 18b (Scheme 2). Attempts at running a cycloaddition of the phosphonate 14a with propargylguanine 18a at 110 \u00b0C in toluene resulted in the recovery of starting materials only. Similarly, when the 3-azidopropylphosphonate 14c was treated with 18a or 18b at 110 \u00b0C in toluene, as well as under microwave (MW) irradiation in aqueous ethanol, no traces of cycloadducts were observed.\n\nFor this reason, we turned to 2-amino-6-chloro-9-propargylpurine 19, which was found to be sufficiently soluble in the reaction medium and reacted with the respective \u03c9-azidoalkylphosphonates 14 to form the intermediate 2-amino-6-chloropurines 17, which were transformed into guanine analogues in the last step. Thus, azides 14 were subjected to cycloaddition with Compound 19 in the presence of Cu(I) salt under microwave irradiation to give 1,2,3-triazoles 17a\u2013k. Reactions were complete at 35\u201340 \u00b0C within 15 min (Scheme 3). Subsequently, 17a\u2013k were treated with 75% trifluoroacetic acid to provide acyclic guanosine analogues 16a\u2013k in good yields (92%\u201398%). However, attempts at preparing (1R,2S)-16k and (1S,2S)-16k failed, since the treatment of (1R,2S)-17k and (1S,2S)-17k with trifluoroacetic acid led to severe decomposition. All final compounds were purified by chromatography, and solids were finally recrystallized; their purity was ascertained by NMR spectroscopic methods and elemental analysis.\n\nAll phosphonates 16a\u2013j and 17a\u2013k were evaluated for their antiviral activities against a wide variety of DNA and RNA viruses using the following cell-based assays: (1) human embryonic lung (HEL) cell cultures: herpes simplex virus-1 (KOS), herpes simplex virus-2 (G), vaccinia virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, herpes simplex virus-1 (TK\u2212 KOS ACVr) and adenovirus-2, cytomegalovirus (AD-169 strain and Davis strain) and varicella-zoster virus (TK+ VZV stain and TK\u2212 VZV stain); (2) HeLa cell cultures: vesicular stomatitis virus, Coxsackie virus B4 and respiratory syncytial virus; (3) Vero cell cultures: para-influenza-3 virus, reovirus-1, Sindbis virus, Coxsackie virus B4, Punta Toro virus; (4) Crandell-Rees feline kidney (CRFK) cell cultures: feline corona virus (FIPV) and feline herpesvirus (FHV); and (5) Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell cultures: influenza A virus H1N1 subtype, influenza A virus H3N2 subtype and influenza B virus. Ganciclovir, cidofovir, acyclovir, brivudine, (S)-9-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)adenine ((S)-DHPA), Hippeastrum hybrid agglutinin (HHA), Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA), dextran sulfate (molecular weight 5000, DS-5000), ribavirin, oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine and rimantadine were used as the reference compounds. The antiviral activity was expressed as the EC50: the compound concentration required to reduce virus-induced cytopathogenicity by 50%. Unfortunately, no inhibitory activity against any virus was detected for the evaluated compounds at 250 \u00b5M.\n\nThe cytotoxicity of the tested compounds toward the uninfected host cells was defined as the minimum cytotoxic concentration (MCC) that causes a microscopically-detectable alteration of normal cell morphology. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50), causing a 50% decrease in cell viability, was determined using a colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay system. The cytostatic activity of the tested compounds was defined as the 50% cytostatic inhibitory concentration (IC50), causing a 50% decrease in cell proliferation, and was determined against murine leukemia L1210, human T-lymphocyte CEM and human cervix carcinoma HeLa cells (Table 1).\n\nNone of the tested compounds affected cell morphology of HEL, HeLa, Vero, MDCK and CRFK cells at concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM. Instead, several compounds appeared slightly cytostatic, selectively against HeLa cells at an IC50 in the 80\u2013210 \u00b5M range. From the entire library of compounds, only (1R,2S)-17k and (1S,2S)-17k appeared to be the most active toward all tested cancerous cell lines, and they showed the highest inhibitory effect (IC50 = 16\u201330 \u00b5M) against the proliferation of murine leukemia (L1210) and human T-lymphocytes (CEM). \n\nThe significantly higher activity of dibenzyl phosphonates (1R,2S)-17k and (1S,2S)-17k is probably due to their better penetration through cell membranes when compared to the other compounds in the series 17, as well as 16, which all were tested as diethyl esters.\n\n1H-NMR were taken in CDCl3 or CD3OD on the following spectrometers: Varian Mercury-300 (Varian NMR Instrument, Palo Alto, CA, USA) with TMS as an internal standard; chemical shifts \u03b4 in ppm with respect to TMS; coupling constants J in Hz. 13C-NMR spectra were recorded on Varian Mercury-300 (Varian NMR Instrument, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and Bruker Avance III spectrometers (Bruker Instruments, Karlsruhe, Germany) at 75.5 and 151 MHz, respectively. 31P-NMR spectra were taken in CDCl3 or CD3OD on a Varian Mercury-300 (Varian NMR Instrument, Palo Alto, CA, USA) at 121.5 MHz.\n\nIR spectral data were measured on an Infinity MI-60 FT-IR spectrometer (ATI Instruments North America\u2014Mattson, Madison, WI, USA). Melting points were determined on a Boetius apparatus (VEB Kombinat NAGEMA, Dresden, DDR\u2014Currently Germany) and are uncorrected. Elemental analyses were performed by the Microanalytical Laboratory of this faculty on a Perkin Elmer PE 2400 CHNS analyzer (Perkin-Elmer Corp., Norwalk, CT, USA).\n\nThe following adsorbents were used: column chromatography, Merck silica gel 60 (70\u2013230 mesh); analytical TLC, Merck TLC plastic sheets silica gel 60 F254. TLC plates were developed in chloroform\u2212methanol solvent systems. Visualization of spots was effected with iodine vapors. All solvents were purified by methods described in the literature.\n\nMicrowave irradiation experiments were carried out in 50-mL glass vials in a microwave reactor Plazmatronika RM 800 (Plazmatronika, Wroc\u0142aw, Poland).\n\nTo a solution of the respective azidoalkylphosphonate 14 (1.00 mmol) in EtOH (1 mL) and H2O (1 mL), CuSO4 \u00d7 5H2O (0.05 mmol), sodium ascorbate (0.10 mmol) and 2-amino-6-chloro-9-propargyl-purine (1.00 mmol) were added. The suspension was irradiated in the microwave reactor (Plazmatronika RM 800, 800 W, Plazmatronika, Wroc\u0142aw, Poland) at 35\u201340 \u00b0C for 15 min. Solvents were removed by vacuum evaporation, and the residue was suspended in chloroform (5 mL) and filtered through a layer of Celite. The solution was concentrated in vacuo, and the crude product was purified on a silica gel column with chloroform\u2013methanol mixtures (50:1, 20:1 or 10:1, v/v) to give the appropriate 1,2,3-triazoles 17.\n\nDiethyl {4-[(2-amino-6-chloro-9H-purin-9-yl)methyl]-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl}methylphosphonate (17a): A white solid (after crystallization from ethyl acetate), yield 88%; m.p. = 138\u2013139 \u00b0C; IR (KBr): \u03bd = 3327, 3211, 2988, 1796, 1613, 1565, 1518, 1468, 1408, 1241 cm\u22121; 1H-NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3): \u03b4 = 7.94 (d, J = 0.8 Hz, 1H, HC5\u2032), 7.93 (s, 1H), 5.38 (s, 2H, CH2), 5.31 (s, 2H, NH2), 4.76 (d, J = 13.3 Hz, 2H, PCH2), 4.15\u20134.04 (m, 4H, 2 \u00d7 POCH2CH3), 1.26 (t, J = 6.9 Hz, 3H, POCH2CH3); 1.25 (t, J = 6.9 Hz, 3H, POCH2CH3); 13C-NMR (75.5 MHz, CDCl3): \u03b4 = 159.43, 153.44, 150.97, 142.27, 142.18, 124.63, 124.52 (d, J = 5.2 Hz, C5\u2032), 63.81 (d, J = 6.6 Hz, POC), 46.08 (d, J = 155.2 Hz, PC), 38.70, 16.46 (d, J = 5.5 Hz, POCC), 16.42 (d, J = 5.5 Hz, POCC); 31P-NMR (121.5 MHz, CDCl3): \u03b4 = 15.93 ppm.

The antiviral, other than anti-HIV, assays were based on the inhibition of the virus-induced cytopathicity or plaque formation in human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblasts, African green monkey cells (Vero), human epithelial cells (HeLa) or Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK). Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID50 of virus (1 CCID50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or with 20 plaque forming units (PFU) (VZV) in the presence of varying concentrations of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity or plaque formation was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC50 or compound concentration required to reduce virus-induced cytopathogenicity or viral plaque formation by 50%.\n\nAll assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates. To each well were added (5\u22127.5) \u00d7 104 tumor cells and a given amount of the test compound. The cells were allowed to proliferate for 48 h (murine leukemia L1210 cells) or 72 h (human lymphocytic CEM and human cervix carcinoma HeLa cells) at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified CO2-controlled atmosphere. At the end of the incubation period, the cells were counted in a Coulter counter. The IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) was defined as the concentration of the compound that inhibited cell proliferation by 50%.\n\nA novel series of {4-[(2-amino-6-chloro-9H-purin-9-yl)methyl]-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl}alkylphosphonates 17 was synthesized and subsequently transformed into {4-[(2-amino-6-oxo-1,6-dihydro-9H-purin-9-yl)methyl]-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl}alkylphosphonates 16 as acyclic analogues of guanosine. Evaluation of the antiviral activity of phosphonates 17a\u2013k, as well as 16a\u2013j was performed against a broad variety of DNA and RNA viruses; however, none of them was found active at concentrations up to 250 \u03bcM. The cytostatic properties of Compounds 17a\u2013k and 16a\u2013j were studied on L1210, CEM and HeLa cell lines. Among them, Compounds (1R,2S)-17k and (1S,2S)-17k were moderately active toward L1210 and CEM cells (IC50 in the 16\u201330 \u00b5M range)."}
