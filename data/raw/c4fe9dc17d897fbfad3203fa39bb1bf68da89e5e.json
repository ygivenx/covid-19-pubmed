{"title": "Political Status of the ROC in Taiwan", "body": "It was observed in Chapter 4, The State and Governments of China, that the Republic of China (ROC) was not a State before it moved its seat to the island of Taiwan, but was a government of the State of China. This chapter reviews the position of the government officials in Taiwan as well as that of foreign governments on the political status of the ROC, or more specifically whether the ROC has become a State, after it moved to Taiwan.\n\nterms, thereby allowing Jiang (Chiang) Kai-shek to be reelected many times by the National Assembly until his death. 488 In Taiwan, Jiang (Chiang) Kai-shek controlled the government apparatus including the \"congress\" during his life time. After the ROC government moved its seat to Taiwan, the Constitution continued to apply to the entirety of China in theory. When the ROC government and the \"congress\" went into exile in the island of Taiwan, most deputies of the \"congress,\" who were elected by the people in China, also followed the government to Taiwan. They continued to represent the people in China under the rule of the Chinese Communists. The National Assembly amended Temporary Provisions Act by adding a provision which authorized the President to issue ordinances for electing new congressional delegates in addition to the original delegates. 489 The original delegates continued to represent their old congressional districts even after their original terms expired. Thus, for 40 years the congressional deputies were in fact permanent members of the \"congress\" until the 1991 amendment of the Constitution. Jiang (Chiang) Kai-shek could control the congressional deputies as his puppets because their livelihood depended on the KMT Party's support.\n\nEver since Jiang (Chiang) Kai-shek arrived in Taiwan, he imposed a totalitarian rule on the Taiwanese. In 1954, Jiang (Chiang) Kai-shek had Martial Law amended to authorize trials of civilians by court martial for offenses against national security, and then declared implementation of the Martial Law in Taiwan. Special penal laws were enacted to suppress opposition. National security was placed under the control of the Military Security Guards. Many dissidents were tried and sentenced to death by court martial, or simply disappeared without trace. 490 488 Temporary Provisions Act, Id. Art. 3, referring to Art. 47 of the ROC Constitution. Jiang (Chiang) Kai-shek resigned in 1949 to negotiate with the Chinese Communist Party. He resumed the Presidency in 1950 and continued in the position until his death in 1975. 489 Id. Art. 6 was amended to authorize President to issue ordinances for electing new congressional delegates in addition to the existing delegates. 490 The Martial Law was enacted in 1940, amended in 1954. The amendment permitted the President, with a resolution of the Conference of the Executive Institute (The Executive Yuan) and the consent of the Institute of Legislature (The Legislative Yuan), to declare the implementation of martial law. In the following three decades, the Chinese Nationalists continued to rule Taiwan under the Martial Law until 1987. As early as 1949, the US Department of State Policy Planning Staff at one time suggested that the US issue a \"White Paper on China dealing with Formosa with particular emphasis being laid upon Chinese misrule of the islands since VJ-Day.\" US Department of State/Foreign relations of the United States 1949. The Far East: China. Vol. IX (1949) . \"Chinese administration on the islands has been rapacious and oppressive and the chaos.\" Id.\n\nJiang (Chiang) Kai-shek took three steps to legitimize his rule of the island of Taiwan and its inhabitants. The first step was that while in China he claimed that the island of Taiwan was returned to the ROC by the surrender of the Japanese military authority to the Chinese authority in Taipei in 1945, notwithstanding that the island was still Japan's territory. The second step was that the ROC government in China issued a decree in January of 1946 announcing that all the Taiwanese people residing in Taiwan \"are restored\" the citizenship of the ROC retroactively to October 25, 1945 when Japan surrendered, 491 even though the Taiwanese people still resided in Japanese territory and had neither renounced nor been deprived of their Japanese citizenship.\n\nAfter the ROC government moved its seat to Taiwan, Jiang (Chiang) Kai-shek took a third step to legitimize his authority to rule Taiwan. He created some political slogans collectively characterized here as the \"one China dogma.\" The one China dogma is, \"There is only one China; China means the Republic of China; the Republic of China's territory consists of China proper and the island of Taiwan; and the People's Republic of China (PRC) illegally occupies the Republic of China's territory.\" 492 From the beginning, Jiang (Chiang) Kai-shek's one-China dogma was a myth. When the ROC took exile in Taiwan in 1949, it had lost China forever. The Nationalists lost the trust of the people in China due to the mismanagement of the ROC officials. By 1950, the PRC government was firmly established, controlling China proper except for two small offshore islands (Kinmen and Matsu). In contrast, the ROC government only controlled the two Chinese small offshore islands and the island of Taiwan which was not China's territory. Thus, while there is only one China, China could not mean the ROC; the PRC did not \"illegally occupy the ROC's territory\" as the one-China dogma claimed. Although Jiang (Chiang) created the myth to legitimize his authority and power in Taiwan, since he was the paramount leader of the KMT Party, the Party and the government were able to permeate the dogma throughout the Taiwan society. 491 See Chen Yi-nan, ROC forced citizenship on unwary Taiwanese, THE TAIPEI TIMES, Jan 20, 2011, p. 8., available at http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/ 2011/01/20/2003493942. Last visited, 07/16/2015. 492 \"One China dogma (i zhong jiao tiao in Chinese)\" is not an official name of a teaching or political philosophy. Rather, it is a general term referring to the collective political slogans of Jiang (Chiang) Kai-shek described in the quotation.\n\nJiang (Chiang) Kai-shek, like most of the Chinese people, did not distinguish the concept of State and the concept of government and treated the ROC as a State. In addressing his countrymen Jiang (Chiang) Kai-shek often used an expression \"our country the ROC.\" After Jiang (Chiang) Kai-shek moved to the island of Taiwan, he still considered himself the legitimate leader of his country \"the ROC.\" He regarded the PRC as a traitor regime established by the Chinese Communists, who \"had stolen the territory of his country the ROC.\" In Taiwan, Jiang (Chiang) Kai-shek never intended to establish a new State limiting its territory to the island of Taiwan. After the 1951 Peace Treaty of San Francisco was concluded, he still intended to retake the China mainland. In an attempt to motivate his army, he created a slogan: \"Counter attack the mainland (Chinese Communists); retake the lost territory.\" In 1964, on the eve of France switching its recognition from the ROC to the PRC, French President De Gaulle called Jiang (Chiang) Kai-shek and advised him of the imminent French action and that if Jiang (Chiang) would declare the ROC a new State limiting its territory to the island of Taiwan, France would recognize the new State and the ROC as its legitimate government. Jiang (Chiang) refused. 493 He refused because such a move would lose the legitimacy of his ambition to recover his homeland.\n\nAfter Jiang (Chiang) Kai-shek died in 1978 during his term of the presidency, his son Jiang (Chiang) Jing-guo succeeded to his power. Upon the death of Jiang (Chiang) Kai-shek, the Vice President Yen Chia-kan succeeded to the Presidency pursuant to the ROC constitution, but soon resigned to allow Jiang (Chiang) Jing-guo to become the President. 494 During the lifetime of Jiang (Chiang) Kai-shek, Jiang (Chiang) Jing-guo had already built up a strong position in the ROC government. Jiang (Chiang) Kai-shek appointed him the Premier 493 This is an account of Dean Rusk, the former Secretary of State during the presidency of John Kennedy and Linden Johnson. When he began to teach international law at the University of Georgia, School of Law after Johnson's term expired, he and this writer taught international law together for one year. This writer learned of this historical episode during a private conversation at this writer's residence. 494 Jiang (Chiang) Jing-guo, President of the ROC (1978\u00c088).\n\n(officially \"The President of the Executive Institute\") of the ROC, 495 who also controlled the KMT Party.\n\nJiang (Chiang) Jing-guo never established a new State in Taiwan either. As the President of the ROC, Jiang (Chiang) Jing-guo never intended to establish a State limiting its territory to the island of Taiwan. He also relied on the one-China dogma to legitimize his rule of Taiwan. But he had no intention to retake the China mainland, and simply adopted a new slogan, \"Unification of China by the Three People's Principles.\"\n\nTo other States, the ROC in Taiwan was a government of China in exile. Until the conclusion of the Peace Treaty of San Francisco, the island of Taiwan, while under the administration of the ROC government at the assignment of the US Government, was Japan's territory. In 1951, when the United States and other Allied powers signed the Peace Treaty of San Francisco with Japan, the ROC was not a party to the Peace Treaty, though it also had conducted the war with Japan. When the United States and the United Kingdom were drafting the peace treaty, they could not include \"the Republic of China\" as a party because the War was between States, and the ROC was not a State, just a government. They did not include China as a party because they did not want either government to represent China in the Treaty: the PRC government which fought the United Nations (UN) forces in the Korean War 496 was not recognized by most Western States as the legitimate government of China; the ROC government, which had lost most of China's territory, had no legitimacy to represent the State of China.\n\nAs stated earlier, in 1964 when France recognized the PRC and simultaneously withdrew its recognition of the ROC, the ROC did not become a State. 497 recognition to the PRC also recognized it as the government of China. The ROC continued to be a government of China in exile after the Peace Treaty of San Francisco entered into force. In 1970 when the UN General Assembly debated which government, the ROC or the PRC, should take China's seat, the PRC accused the US Government and Japanese government of plotting to create two \"Chinas.\" The Japanese Ambassador to the UN Min Aichi replied that \"Japan will continue to espouse the '1-China' policy,\" 498 implying that the ROC was not a new State.\n\nWhen the United States withdrew recognition of the ROC in 1979, the ROC did not become a State. Then President Jiang (Chiang) Jingguo did not intend to establish a new State limiting its territory to the island of Taiwan. Other States followed the United States, leaving only a number of small States which continued to recognize the ROC as China's representative government. The ROC government became isolated in the international community.\n\nIn Taiwan, since 1945 when the ROC government took over the administration of the island, the political power was in the Chinese people. For 43 years, the political power was in Jiang (Chiang)'s family: first Jiang (Chiang) Kai-shek and then his son Jiang (Chiang) Jing-guo. Most government officials and deputies of the \"congress\" were Chinese, whom the Taiwanese referred to as \"the mainlanders\" or \"people from the other Provinces.\"\n\nThe Chinese totalitarian rule finally aroused anti-Chinese sentiment among the Taiwanese people. When the Chinese soldiers arrived in Taiwan on US Navy ships in 1945, they called themselves \"the liberators\" and were welcomed by the Taiwanese. But since 1947, for decades, the people lived in fear of persecution under the shadow of the 1947 \"228 Incident.\" In the 1960s, after a long period of the totalitarian rule under the martial law, a Taiwan independence movement began to sprout. In 1979, the year after the United States withdrew its recognition of the ROC government, an incident, subsequently called \"The Incident of Formosa magazine,\" 499 illustrated the KMT's totalitarianism. In December of that year, Taiwanese political leaders gathered in Kaohsiung City to celebrate the 31st anniversary of the signing of the UN Convention of Human Rights. After the meeting, as the Taiwanese politicians and the audience were preparing to march on the street they were blocked and beaten by the ROC's Military Security Guards and police. The conflict between them resulted in the arrest of many Taiwanese politicians. Many were sentenced to a long-term imprisonment.\n\nAnother incident occurred in 1981. A Professor Wen-chen Chen of Carnegie-Mellon University, while visiting Taiwan in July 1981, was found dead from falling from a second floor in the campus of his alma mater, The National Taiwan University, after being questioned by the Military Security Guards on the day before. Although the authority announced suicide as the cause of death, many people would not rule out a political assassination.\n\nWhile Jiang (Chiang) Kai-shek called Taiwan \"Free China,\" the Taiwanese people subsequently called the period under the two Jiang (Chiang)s \"the White Terror era.\" 500 Although the ensuing unrest in the Taiwanese society eventually forced Jiang (Chiang) Jing-guo to lift the martial law in 1987, a year before his death, the Taiwanese people were still mistreated by the Nationalist Chinese.\n\nThe next section will closely examine the position of the United States on the political status of the ROC during the era of the two Jiang (Chiang)s. 499 A brief narration of the incident follows: \"In November of 1979, the publisher of 'Formosa' magazine requested the government for a permit for an outdoor rally to celebrate the 31st anniversary of the UN Convention of Human Rights. The permit was issued but was restricted to a rally, no parade. On December 10, 1979, after the rally, the participants began to walk on the street. recognition of the ROC Upon withdrawal of its recognition of the ROC, the United States also terminated the US\u00c0China (the ROC) Mutual Defense Treaty because the treaty had lost its purpose-defending against the invasion of the PRC government, which was now recognized as the representative government of the other party to the treaty. The withdrawal of the recognition of the ROC by the US demonstrated that the US regarded the ROC as a government. As it was discussed in Chapter 2, The State and Sovereignty, in State practice, while recognition of a State cannot be withdrawn, recognition of a government may be withdrawn. The withdrawal of recognition of the ROC by the United States and other States did not make the ROC a new State as some people in Taiwan have claimed. Withdrawal of recognition is an act of destruction of a relationship, not an act of creation of a new entity.\n\nNor did the US Congress consider the ROC a State. When the United States terminated the US\u00c0China (the ROC) Mutual Defense Treaty, the US Congress enacted the Taiwan Relations Act (the \"Act\") 503 to protect the people of Taiwan against the invasion of the Chinese Communists as well as the security and interest of the United States in the Western Pacific. If the ROC was a State, then the US Government could enter into a mutual defense treaty with it, instead of employing such a roundabout maneuver. \n\nFurthermore, the judicial branch of the United States has not considered the ROC a State either. 508 In the United States, a constitutional principle is that on matters of recognition of a foreign State and a foreign government, the judicial branch follows the decisions and opinions of the Executive branch because they are political questions. 509 The Court in Cheng Fu Sheng v. Rogers 510 stated, \"It is fundamental that such questions as whether a foreign country or a foreign government should be formally recognized are problems that are not to be solved by the courts, but are political matters that are to be decided by the executive and legislative departments of the Government. On such topics the President and the Secretary of State speak for the United States, and the courts are obligated to follow their pronouncements. Nevertheless, the US courts, in deciding the application of an international treaty or a municipal law, had occasions to give their reasons that the ROC was not a State. Two cases involving the application of the Warsaw Convention 512 confirmed that the ROC was not a State. In the first case, John Lee and Margaret Lee v. China Airlines Ltd., 513 two passengers on a flight from Hong Kong 514 to San Francisco sued China Airlines in a US federal court sitting in California for injuries caused by a sudden drop of the airplane of 31,000 ft in the air, off the coast of California. The defendant argued that the US federal court had no jurisdiction to try the case. The plaintiffs argued that the federal court had jurisdiction, and, if their action were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, they would be compelled to bring the action abroad, either in Taiwan 515 or in Hong Kong, 516 where they would not receive an adequate hearing of their claims because, they argued, the Warsaw Convention would not apply to either Hong Kong or Taiwan. The court, in holding that the Warsaw Convention applied and it had no subject matter jurisdiction according to the Convention, dismissed the action. 517 The court added that if the plaintiffs sued in either Hong Kong or Taiwan, \"[t]he Warsaw Convention will figure prominently in the decision making process over there because both Hong Kong and Taiwan adhere to it.\" 518 The court statement that \"Taiwan adhere[s] to [the Warsaw Convention]\" implied that Taiwan was a contracting party of the Warsaw Convention. It should be noted, however, that at the time when the accident occurred, while the PRC government of China ratified and adhered to the Warsaw Convention in July Taiwan had neither ratified nor adhered to the Warsaw Convention. Thus, the reason that the court ruled that Taiwan was a contracting party was because it regarded Taiwan a part of China and covered by the Warsaw Convention; the ROC was not a State.\n\nThe second case in which an American court held that the ROC was not a State was Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co. v. Northwest Airlines. 519 In this case, Tacoma Boat Building Co. (Tacoma) delivered some machinery to Northwest Airlines (\"Northwest\") for shipment from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Taipei, Taiwan. Tacoma claimed that certain parts of their machinery components were damaged due to Northwest's negligence during the air transport of the components. Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co. 520 and Tacoma jointly sued Northwest in Milwaukee for damages. In the federal district court sitting in Milwaukee, 521 the issue was whether the state court or the federal court had the subject matter jurisdiction to try the case. The plaintiffs, which argued that the state court had the jurisdiction, claimed that the Warsaw Convention did not apply on the grounds that Taiwan was not a party to the Convention and, thus, the federal court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The defendant, Northwest, argued that the Warsaw Convention applied to the case and, thus, the federal court had jurisdiction. In reaching the conclusion that the Warsaw Convention applied, the federal court said that it had \"federal subject matter jurisdiction . . . only if Taipei, Taiwan-the flight destination-also was a party to the convention.\" 522 519 796 F. Supp. 1188, 1191 (E.D. Wis. 1992). 520 It had paid Tacoma for the loss under an insurance policy and was subrogated Tacoma's right against Northwest. 521 The plaintiffs originally brought the case to the circuit court for Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, a state court, which at the defendant's motion, remanded the case to the federal court sitting in Milwaukee. Id. at 1189. 522 The court stated:\n\nhe convention is applicable where . . . the contract of transportation (e.g., a plane ticket) involves travel from one 'High Contracting' party to another . . . [A] High Contracting party is a state which is an original signatory to the convention or one which ratified the convention or filed declarations of adherence to the convention after it went into force. Further, a declaration of adherence to the convention by a state may include colonies or territories of that state.\"\n\nId. 1190\u00c091 (citations omitted).\n\nHolding that Taiwan was a party to the convention, the federal court explained as follows:\n\nSince 1949 to the present [1992] , two governments-the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China [PRC]-claim to be the sole legitimate government of \"China,\" which both governments agree is comprised of mainland China and Taiwan. In reality, the Republic of China retains control only over the island of Taiwan while the PRC retains control over the mainland; neither government has asserted that they are two separate countries. 523\n\nThe court further stated:\n\nThe world community was compelled to determine whether the ROC or the PRC would receive formal recognition as the legitimate government of China. On December 30, 1978, the US formally recognized the PRC as the sole government of China, in its entirety, and withdrew recognition from the ROC. Over 100 other nations and the UN have done the same. 524\n\nAlthough the ROC in Taiwan had never adhered to the Warsaw Convention in its own name, the court accepted the defendant's argument that Taiwan was a party to this convention because of the declaration made by the PRC when it ratified the Warsaw Convention. The PRC's declaration stated that the convention \"shall of course apply to the entire Chinese territory including Taiwan,\" and that \"the recognition of the PRC as the sole government of China by the United States, the United Nations and over 100 other nations legitimizes this declaration despite the continued existence of the ROC.\" 525 523 Id. at 1190 (citations omitted). 524 Id. (citation omitted). 525 The two cases discussed above demonstrated that the US courts did not consider the ROC a State after the ROC moved its seat to Taiwan, but regarded it only as a government of China. 526 Whether the courts were correct in stating that \"Taiwan was a part of China\" is a different issue to be dealt with later in this work. However, regardless of the characterization of the ROC by Jiang (Chiang) Kai-shek and Jiang (Chiang) Jing-guo while they were in Taiwan, the United States at the time did not regard the ROC as a State.\n\nIn 1949, the Chinese Communists did not establish a new State. As stated earlier, the PRC is a new government of China. Thus, the PRC did not apply to join the United Nations as a new member. Instead, it claimed that it was entitled to represent an existing member, China, in the United Nations on the ground that it was China's sole legitimate government.\n\nUntil 1972, the State of China was represented by the ROC government in the United Nations. When the United Nations was formed in 1945, the ROC was the government that represented China. To the United Nations, the ROC was still the representative government of China after Jiang (Chiang) Kai-shek took exile in the island of Taiwan.\n\nThe PRC attempted to replace the ROC in the United Nations for 22 years. In its attempt to replace the ROC, the PRC solicited the assistance of its allies in the Soviet block. In September 1950, a year after the PRC was established, Cuba proposed in the United Nations to include in 526 One exception that an US court held that Taiwan was a \"nation\" was New York Chinese TV Programs, Inc. the annual meeting agenda of the General Assembly a discussion of the question of China's representation. The General Assembly established a Special Committee consisting of seven members to consider the question. 527 In December 1950, the General Assembly adopted a resolution recommending that the representation question \"should be considered in the light of the Purposes and Principles of the Charter and the circumstances of each case,\" 528 but did not address directly the question of China's representation.\n\nDuring the 1951 and 1952 General Assembly sessions, no proposal to decide China's representation was made. The UN's armed forces were fighting the PRC's \"volunteer army\" in the Korean Peninsula. Perhaps, no State thought it appropriate to raise the question.\n\nAfter the armistice of the Korean War, the proposal to include the question of China's representation in the General Assembly annual meeting agenda was resurrected. Each year from 1953 to 1960, a member of the Soviet bloc made the proposal. Each time the proposal was rejected by a majority vote. 529 In the 1960s, the US Government insulated the ROC's position in the United Nations by a procedural maneuver. When a similar proposal was made again in 1961, the US Government (the Kennedy Administration) invoked an article in the UN Charter to create a procedural barrier for any proposal to change the representation with respect to China in the United Nations. The General Assembly adopted a resolution proposed by the US Government to designate the representation question 527 decreased correspondingly. In 1970, the Nixon Administration was willing to allow representatives of the PRC to take China's seat in the General Assembly and in the Security Council on a condition that the representatives of the ROC remained in the General Assembly. 537 The PRC, on the other hand, insisted that it would take over China's seat only if the representatives of the ROC were expelled from the United Nations. 538 The US Government refused to accept the PRC's condition, and again proposed that the representation question was an \"important question.\" 539 The proposal was adopted by a narrower margin this time. 540 A proposal by Albania, which followed, to expel the representatives of the ROC was again defeated. 541 In Council. 542 The General Committee 543 prepared a General Assembly agenda which included both the United States proposal calling for \"the continued right of representation of the ROC [in the General Assembly]\" 544 and Albania's proposal calling for the representatives of the PRC to take China's seat as well as for the expulsion of the representatives of the ROC from the United Nations. 545 In the General Assembly, the United States proposal to make the question of expelling the representatives of the ROC from the United Nations an \"important question\" was, for the first time, defeated. 546 Thus, China's \"representation question\" was to be decided by a majority vote. The proposed resolution of Albania put to the vote at the end of the debates on October 25, 1971 was adopted. 547 In the General Assembly, the United States again attempted to create dual representations, but failed. When Albania's proposed resolution to replace the ROC with the PRC was presented for voting, the Nixon Administration voted against Albania's proposal. But Albania's proposed resolution was carried by a large margin.\n\nResolution regarded that the State that joined the organization was the State of China and that the ROC was the government representing China at the time. During the 1971 debate in the General Assembly resulting in the passage of Resolution 2758, the State involved was the State of China. The proposal was to expel the ROC government, not to expel one of its members, China.\n\nThe Resolution of the United Nations involved a question of representation in the United Nations. Since in principle only one government was allowed to represent a member in the United Nations, the question at the time was: Which government, the ROC or the PRC was to represent the member China. The Resolution made this point clear in the language adopted. It \"[d]ecides to restore all its rights to the People's Republic of China and to recognize the representatives of its Government as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations.\" 549 Thus, when the United Nations expelled the ROC, what it expelled was a government, not a State. After the representatives of the PRC replaced the representatives of the ROC in the United Nations, the UN documents listing its members state \"China\" as its member and also indicates that China was admitted on October 24, 1945, a date prior to the establishment of the PRC. The name plate on the desk where the representatives of the PRC to the UN sit states \"China,\" not \"the People's Republic of China\" or \"the PRC.\"\n\nResolution 2758 created the UN's China policy. The Resolution has three propositions: there is only one China; its government is the PRC; in the United Nations, the people in China will be represented by the PRC government thereafter. If the propositions have become the UN's policy over China, it is quite different from \"the UN's one China policy\" that subsequently developed.\n\nIn 1988, the political power of the ROC fell on a Taiwanese. When Jiang (Chiang) Jing-guo died in January 1988 before his second term expired, Vice-President Lee Teng-hui assumed the presidency for the rest of Jiang (Chiang)'s term. Lee was the first Taiwanese to become the 549 Id.\n\nROC President. 550 He, at the same time, became the Chairman of the Chinese Nationalist Party (The KMT). In 1990 when Jiang (Chiang) Jing-guo's residual term expired, the National Assembly elected Lee to be the President for a term of six years. 551 When Lee first assumed the presidency in 1988, the ROC was already isolated in the international society. An overwhelming number of the States recognized the PRC as the representative government of China. Fewer than 40 States still recognized the ROC as the representative government of China. All of those States were small and, except the Holy See (the Vatican), had received significant financial aid from the ROC government.\n\nFrom the beginning, Lee Teng-hui, like his predecessors, considered the ROC a \"country\" that had sovereignty over the entire China as well as the island of Taiwan. As the Chairman of the KMT, Lee adhered to the KMT's one-China dogma. He had no intention to establish a new State limiting its territory to the island of Taiwan.\n\nThe people of Taiwan were confused as to the political status of the ROC. Throughout the rule of Jiang (Chiang) Kai-shek and Jiang (Chiang) Jing-guo, the people of Taiwan lived under the shadow of the one-China dogma. But to them, China, Zhong (Chung) Guo or the \"Middle Country,\" referred to the country called the PRC or Zhong (Chung) Hua Jen Min Kung He Guo across the Taiwan Strait. They, however, had different perceptions on the political status of the ROC. Although some people understood that the ROC was a government of the State of China exiled on the island of Taiwan, most people regarded the ROC as a country, largely due to the influence of the Chinese name of the ROC, Zhong (Chung) Hua Min Guo, and the one-China dogma.\n\nAfter Lee took the office of the presidency of his own term in 1990, he embarked on some political reforms. In 1991, he terminated the Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communists Rebellion Act 552 pursuant to its provision. 553 The most important reform was restructuring of the \"congress\" to reflect the reality that the ROC no longer governed the territory and the people under the control of the PRC. Up until that time, the \"congress\" included \"representatives\" of regions in mainland China that were under the control of the PRC. In order to reform composition of the deputies in the three houses of the \"congress\" to reflect the reality, Lee initiated an amendment to the ROC Constitution by the National Assembly in 1991. The Amendment of the Nanjing (Nanking) Constitution of 1946 554 changed the structure of the \"congress.\" The \"permanent\" deputies who represented the people who never elected them were persuaded to retire with favorable entitlements to quell their opposition. The amendments were welcomed by the people of Taiwan. However, the amended ROC Constitution does not forsake the one-China dogma, in particular the ROC's claim of sovereignty over \"Mainland China.\" The 1991 Amendment consists of 10 Articles. The most important provisions concern the formation of the members of the three houses of the \"congress.\" The first three Articles provide the number of deputies in the National Assembly, 555 the Institute of Legislation (the Legislature Yuan), 556 and the Institute of Control (the Control Yuan). 557 The Amendment creates two geographic regions for the purpose of selecting the deputies: \"the Free Region\" and \"the Entire Country.\" 558 The term \"the Free Region,\" by implication, refers to the territory under the actual control of the ROC: the \"Province of Taiwan\" and China's two offshore islands, Kinmen and Matsu. The term \"the Entire Country,\" by implication, refers to both the territory under the control of the ROC and the territory under the control of the PRC. Thus, the amended ROC Constitution still applies, in theory, to entire China as well as Taiwan. Under the amended Constitution, the people in \"Mainland China\" still have representation in the ROC's new \"congress.\" For each house of the \"congress,\" the number of deputies elected by the residents of cities or prefectures in the Free Region (Taiwan) is determined by the size of the population of the cities or the prefectures. In addition, a fixed number of deputies collectively represent the entire population of \"the Entire Country.\" 559 The latter are appointed by political parties according to a system of proportional representation: each political party gains additional seats proportionate to the votes it receives in the congressional election. Thus, the people in \"Mainland China\" are represented by the deputies selected to represent \"the Entire Country.\"\n\nIn 1992, Lee persuaded the National Assembly to make another amendment to the ROC Constitution. 560 The major change of the 1992 Amendment to the Constitution was on the method of electing the President and the Vice-President. It changed from an indirect election method-an election by the National Assembly-to a direct election method-a general election by the people in the \"Free Region.\" Other than that, the amended ROC Constitution continued to apply to the territory and the people under the control of the PRC government. 561 In 1996 when Lee Teng-hui's term expired, he was reelected for a term of 4 years in a general election pursuant to the 1992 Amendment to the Constitution. In the spring of 1996, Lee ran for the presidency as the candidate of the KMT Party against Peng Ming-min, the candidate of the opposition party, the Democratic Progressive Party (the DPP). During the election campaign, Peng, who was once imprisoned during Jiang (Chiang) Jing-guo's term for writing a \"Manifesto of the Taiwanese selfpreservation,\" was perceived to be pro-independence. But Peng lost the 559 The fixed numbers of deputies who represent the \"Entire Country\" are as follows:\n\nFor the National Assembly, \"80 deputies from the entire country without regard to the regions.\" Amendment to the Constitution, supra note 554, Art. election not because of his political stand but due to other factors. One factor was that Lee as the President had achieved some political reforms, leading some voters to perceive that Lee, a Taiwanese, was in a better position to pave a way for the eventual independence of Taiwan; another factor was that the KMT Party, which had ruled Taiwan for one half a century, had built up influence on the voters by controlling local officials of the compartmentalized municipalities, an administrative system based on the system established by the former Japanese government. The 1996 election pursuant to the amended Constitution was the first time in the history of the ROC that a general election was employed to elect the President and the Vice President. Some Taiwanese politicians claimed that the election of the President and the Vice-president by a general election turned the ROC into a new State. 562 However, Lee disappointed many of his supporters in his 1996 inaugural speech when he called for a \"peaceful reunification of China.\" 563 He proclaimed that \"there is only one China; there is no so-called 'Taiwan independence.'\" 564 The speech followed the lines of Jiang (Chiang) Kai-shek's one-China dogma. The term \"reunification of China\" implied that Taiwan was part of China. While Lee had been perceived by many people in Taiwan as pro-Taiwan, his proclamation in his inaugural speech confused them and created a society which was, as a New York Times reporter described it, \"in a schizophrenic environment.\" 565 For the next 5 years, Lee maintained the same position.\n\nThough Lee had said that the ROC was a country many times, to other States the ROC in Taiwan Knaebe: You are considered as a renegade province by Beijing's government. That is, of course, a permanent intimidation and threat from the Mainland. How are you coping with these dangers? Lee:\n\nThe historical fact is, that since the establishment of Chinese Communist regime in 1949, it has never ruled the territory under the ROC (Republic of China)-Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu. The 1991 Constitutional Amendment had designated cross-Strait relationship as special state-to-state relationship, rather than an internal relationship between a legitimate government and a renegade group or between a central government and local government. Knabe:\n\nDeclaring Taiwan as an independent state seems to be no realistic option. Beijing's \"one country two systems\" is not acceptable for the majority of the people in Taiwan The statement of Lee stirred up political debates both in Taiwan and abroad. The statement was subsequently referred to as the \"special stateto-state relationship statement.\" Some called it the \"Two-state doctrine.\"\n\nIn Taiwan, the topic was a sensitive one and the reactions to the statement were diverse. The day after the interview was broadcast in the German TV, Taiwan's newspapers printed exciting headlines, claiming that Lee Teng-hui had created two Chinas during the interview. Many Taiwanese joyfully acclaimed that Lee had declared independence. Some even started to call Lee \"Father of the country.\"\n\nWhether Lee intended to create confusion or his statement created an unintended consequence was a subject of debates. His officials were caught off guard. There was no advanced warning to them that he would make such a drastic statement. They were quickly engaged in damage control, lest there would be a misunderstanding inside and outside of Taiwan. The immediate action for them to take was explaining to the people in Taiwan what Lee meant by his \"special state-to-state relationship\" statement in the context of the one-China dogma. They did not believe that Lee had declared independence because he said that \"there is no need of declaring independence.\" But he had said something in the interview contrary to what the KMT had thus far preached to the people after Jiang (Chiang) Kai-shek moved to the island of Taiwan.\n\nHowever, the ROC officials were confused. They could not reach a consensus on the meaning of the statement. On July 12, the Commissioner of the Mainland Affairs Su Q (Chi) said that \"Lee Tenghui means 'two countries in one nation.'\" 567 On July 15, the Chief of Information Bureau Cheng Jian-ren also said that \"The special state-to-state relationship means 'two countries in one nation.'\" 568 But Cheng quickly withdrew his explanation next day. He said that \"'Two countries in one nation' is a wrong interpretation; I have to think it over for a better explanation.\" 569 567 He never further publicly clarified the meaning of the statement, probably because he could not come up with a sensible explanation.\n\nLee himself, realizing that he had created a controversy, attempted to clarify his own statement. Less than two weeks after the interview, he took an opportunity of trying to explain his statement. At a meeting of the Taipei Chapter of International Rotary Club on July 20, 1999, when he was asked to explain the \"special state-to-state relationship,\" he replied that \"[t]he [ROC] government is not engaged in the Taiwan independence [movement] . Without equal status in a negotiation [with the PRC government], problems such as smuggling of drugs and guns or transmitting of the foot-and-mouth disease, 570 are difficult to resolve.\" 571 It was not much of an explanation of the controversial statement. Instead of providing the meaning of \"the special state-to-state relationship,\" he merely explained why he made the statement.\n\nIf the ROC officials were confused, it was because the statement itself was confusing. In fact, there were outright contradictions in Lee's statements made during the interview, if the word \"state\" in the \"special state-to-state relationship\" meant an independent territorial political institution. The first aspect of contradiction regarded the time when the ROC became a \"State.\" Lee explained in the interview that \"the 1991 constitutional amendment had designated cross-Strait relationship as special state-to-state relationship, rather than an internal relationship between a legitimate government and a renegade group or between a central government and local government.\" 572 By 1999 when Lee was interviewed, the PRC government was already recognized by a great majority of the States as the representative government of China-a government which called Taiwan a \"renegade province.\" Thus, Lee's statement implied that the ROC was upgraded to a State from a \"local government\" by the Amendment to the ROC Constitution in 1991. However, in the same interview, Lee also stated that \"the ROC was a sovereign country since 1912.\" 573 Was it 1912 or 1991 when the ROC was established as a \"State\"? For sure, he did not mean that the ROC became a State limiting its territory to the island of Taiwan at the time of the interview. In fact, 570 It is a contagious disease carried by animals from China. Deborah Kuo, In Taiwan as discussed earlier, when the ROC was established in 1911, it was a government of China. China was a State long before the establishment of the ROC The second aspect of contradiction there would be was on the statehood of the ROC, if the word \"state\" meant an independent territorial political institution. If the word \"state\" in his statement meant independent territorial political institution, Lee's statement in the interview meant both the ROC and the PRC were independent territorial political institutions. Then, the 1991 Amendment to the ROC Constitution also had the same effect of making both the ROC and the PRC States in 1991. However, in 1991 there was only one China, the ROC, under the amended ROC Constitution. To other States, though there was also only one China, the State China was represented by the PRC.\n\nThe third aspect of contradiction if the word \"state\" in his statement meant an independent territorial political institution was with the one-China dogma. When Lee made the statement in the 1999 interview, it would be the first time an ROC President attempted to seek an equal status between the ROC and the PRC: declaring that both were independent territorial political institutions, each with its own territory. Yet, there was no provision in the 1991 Amendment which could be interpreted to have turned the ROC into a State limiting its territory to the island of Taiwan, or have created a \"special state-to-state relationship\" between the ROC and the PRC. On the contrary, the ROC still attempted to exercise sovereign power over China under the 1991 amended Constitution. In amending the ROC Constitution in 1991, the ROC did not discard the KMT's one-China dogma.\n\nIf interpreting the word \"state\" in the \"special state-to-state relationship\" statement as \"independent territorial political institution\" makes no sense, the word \"state\" must be given a different meaning.\n\nD. The Meaning of the \"special state-to-state relationship\" Statement It will make more sense if the word \"state\" in the \"special state-to-state relationship\" statement is rendered as \"government.\" The circumstances under which Lee made the statement would shed some light on the meaning of the word. In the television broadcast, during the interview while the German Deutsche Welle TV Asian expert Dr. Guenther Knabe asked questions in English, Lee replied in Mandarin Chinese with a simultaneous English translation. Lee's Chinese words that were rendered \"state-to-state\" in English translation were \"Guo (country) and Guo (country).\" Since both the Chinese terms for the Republic of China or Zhong (Chung) Hua Min Guo and the People's Republic of China or Zhong (Chung) Hua Jen Min Kung He Guo end with the word Guo (country), Lee's statement \"Guo to Guo relationship\" in fact referred to \"the Republic of China\" to \"the People's Republic of China\" relationship. As it was explained before, though both the ROC and the PRC use the word \"Guo (country)\" at the end of their Chinese names, both the ROC and the PRC are governments of the State of China. Thus, Lee's statement means that the ROC and the PRC [should be] in equal status in the relationship between the two governments.\n\nLee's own explanation at the Rotary Club confirmed this interpretation. He explained that \"[t]he [ROC] government is not engaged in the Taiwan independence [movement]. Without equal status in a negotiation [with the PRC government], problems . . . are difficult to resolve.\" 574 A negotiation is conducted between governments. Thus, however Lee characterized the ROC, his statement, in fact, referred to \"the government to government relationship.\"\n\nMaybe, Lee himself was aware that he was not talking about a normal State-to-State relationship and, thus, used the word \"special\" to describe the relationship between the ROC and the PRC. After more than 40 years since Jiang (Chiang) Kai-shek created the one-China dogma, much of the world politic had changed at the time when Lee was interviewed: The UN passed Resolution No. 2758 expelling the ROC from the organization; a great majority of the world community had recognized the PRC as the representative government of China. The PRC government now treated the ROC as \"renegade group.\" It was the ROC government that struggled to seek to be an equal to the PRC government. If Lee's \"government [was] not engaged in the Taiwan independence\" 575 as he said, then it just sought for an equal status between the two governments for negotiation.\n\nThe reaction of foreign governments was uniformly reserved. Practically, no States considered that Lee's statement had turned the ROC into a new State limiting its territory to the island of Taiwan. To foreign 574 See supra note 571. 575 Id. governments and political observers, the ROC was a new government of the State of China when it was established in 1912. When the PRC was established in 1949, it was also a new government of China. Lee's \"special state-to-state relationship\" statement was not a declaration establishing a new State limiting its territory to the island of Taiwan.\n\nThe Deutsche Welle interviewer did not see a declaration of independence in Lee's statement either. Immediately after the German TV broadcast showing the interview, the anchorman, Brian Thomas, asked the interviewer Gruenther Knabe: \"Based on your discussion with President Lee, did you get the impression that he was prepared to declare independence?\" Knabe emphatically replied, \"I think not. He stopped short of doing that.\" 576 A few days after Lee's interview, US Senator Frank H. Murkowsky (R-Alaska) dismissed a suggestion that \"Taiwan has virtually declared independence by President Lee Teng-hui's statement [about the cross-Strait relationship.]\" 577 Three months after Lee made the statement, the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan also rejected any view that the ROC had become a State by Lee's statement. In September 1999, a severe earthquake struck the central part of the island. Many people died. Many more were injured, lost their houses, and traumatized. Immediately thereafter Annan announced that the United Nations had to wait for the approval of the PRC government before the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs could send a disaster assessment team to what he called \"the Taiwan Province of China.\" 578 If in Annan's view Taiwan was a \"Province of China,\" the ROC in Taiwan could not be a State. Whether Annan was correct in characterizing the island of Taiwan as a \"Province of China\" is a different issue to be analyzed later, but his view was that the ROC in Taiwan was not a State because no State can be a province of another State.\n\nIn March 2000, a general election was held before the end of Lee Tenghui's term. The three way race was among Chen Shui-bian of the DPP, Lian Zhan of the Chinese Nationalist Party (The KMT), and Soong Chu-yu (James Soong), who had left the KMT to form The People First Party. Chen Shui-bian (Chen) won the election. Chen, like Lee, was a native Taiwanese. It was the first time the Chinese Nationalist Party lost the executive power of the government, though the Party still retained a majority in the \"congress.\"\n\nAlthough Chen was perceived by his supporters as pro-independence, in public he wavered on his stance on the political status of the ROC throughout his presidency. During the campaign for the president of the ROC, his announced policy toward China was that of compromise and cooperation. He advocated integration of Taiwan with China. A majority of the Taiwanese cast their votes for him because the alternative was worse. In his May 20, 2000 inaugural speech, Chen angered many of his Taiwanese constituencies by announcing a blatantly negative agenda.\n\nChen declared that his China policy was that of \"four-nos and one have-no\": \"as long as the Chinese Communist Party regime has no intention to use military force against Taiwan, I pledge that during my term in office I will not declare independence; I will not change the country name; I will not push forth the inclusion of the so-called 'state-to-state relationship' concept in the Constitution; I will not promote a referendum to change the status quo in regards to the question of independence or unification; I have no plan to abolish the National Reunification Council or the National Reunification Guidelines.\" 579 In essence, Chen had a \"no Taiwan independence\" policy. associations, held an annual conference in Tokyo, Japan, Chen gave a speech to the group via close circuit TV on August 5. During the speech, Chen suddenly, departing from his prepared speech, proclaimed that \"Taiwan and China are two countries, each on one side of the Taiwan Strait and that the (ROC) Institute of Legislation (the Legislature Yuan) should consider passing a referendum law [permitting the people] to protect its sovereignty.\" 580 The Taiwanese were jubilant. The proclamation became known as the \"two countries each on one side [of the Taiwan Strait]\" statement. Chen used the word \"Taiwan,\" even though he was the President of the ROC. He often used \"Taiwan\" instead of \"the ROC,\" possibly to please the people of Taiwan. From then on, Chen claimed that Taiwan or the ROC had sovereignty.\n\nIn March 2004, Chen Shui-bian was reelected for a second term of the presidency. In the presidential campaign, the competition was between Chen, who sought a second term, and Lian Zhan of the KMT Party. Chen won again in the general election. During the campaign, Chen often proclaimed that the ROC was a \"sovereign country.\" In February 2004, in an interview with a reporter, he said that \"The ROC is a sovereignty[sic] independent country,\" but also said that \"Taiwan is a sovereignty[sic] independent country.\" 581 So, after he was reelected, he announced that he would not use a referendum to create a new Constitution, just amend it. 582 But in 2005 President Chen again angered his supporters by making an ambiguous statement on the political status of the ROC. On February 24, 2005, he and his former political rival, The People First Party Chairman James Soong, issued a joint statement. It was not clear why the President had to join with a political rival to make the statement, but the statement said that \"According to the Constitution of the Republic of 580 The ROC is a sovereignty independent country\" in Chinese literally means that The ROC is a country whose sovereignty is independent. The statement \"Taiwan is a sovereignty independent country\" in Chinese literally means that Taiwan is a country whose sovereignty is independent. 582 China (the ROC), our country's status and position is defined as the de facto and de jure status quo existing [with the PRC each] on the opposite side of the Strait.\" But then, Chen pledged in the same joint statement that \"during my term as president, I will not declare independence, [and] will not promote a referendum to change the status quo on the issue of independence or unification.\" 583 Although the language was ambiguous, for sure it was not a declaration establishing a new State separated from the State of China. In fact, Chen in the joint statement said clearly that he \"will not declare independence.\" Soong, who was a pro-China politician, could not have agreed to a make a joint statement declaring independence of the ROC.\n\nLike his predecessor Lee Teng-hui, Chen was simply confused as to the political status of the ROC thinking that it was a country. As a consequence, he constantly made statements that did not make sense in term of international law. For instance, after stating that he would not declare independence in 2005, in an interview in November of 2006 with a Financial Times reporter he claimed that \"Taiwan is a sovereignty[sic] independent State.\" 584 With such a political leader, the people of Taiwan lived in an ever-confused environment.\n\nNotwithstanding Chen's repeated statement that \"The ROC is a sovereignty [sic] independent country,\" or \"Taiwan is a sovereignty [sic] independent country,\" the United Nations and its related organizations as well as the United States did not consider the ROC or Taiwan a sovereign State during his presidency.\n\nIn 2003, World Health Organization (WHO) echoed Kofi Annan's view that \"Taiwan is a province of China,\" implying that Taiwan was not a State. For many years, the ROC applied to WHO to be an \"observer,\" not as a member. Every time, the application was rejected. In April 2003, a disease known as \"severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\" spread to the island of Taiwan. Not being a member of WHO, the ROC government in Taiwan could not receive information provided by the organization for preventing the spread of the disease. A month earlier in March 2003, the ROC government applied, as it had done repeatedly several years in the past, to WHO to become an observer at its annual meeting, World Health Assembly (WHA). When the WHA opened its General Session in Geneva in May 2003, it again rejected the ROC's application, even though the SARS disease continued to spread in Taiwan. The WHO shared Kofi Annan's view on the political status of the ROC, and referred to Taiwan as \"the Taiwan Province, China\" in its website. 585 If Taiwan was a province of China, the ROC could not be a State.\n\nLater in May 2003, Kofi Annan, as the Secretary General of the United Nations again made a statement implying that the ROC was not a State. Puzzled by the WHO's action or inaction, the UN Press Club decided to hold a press conference 586 at the UN Headquarters in New York City to discuss the WHO's decision in rejecting the ROC in its efforts to gain entry into the organization. The Press Club invited a ROC official in New York City, 587 equivalent to the rank of a consulate general, to speak at the conference. When the ROC official attempted to enter the UN building, Kofi Annan barred him from entry \"because of the organization's one-China policy.\" 588 Kofi Annan's statement-the organization (the United Nations)'s one-China Policy-implied that Taiwan was part of China and that the ROC in Taiwan was not a State in the eyes of the United Nations.\n\nThe position of the United States was the same. It did not regard the ROC as a State \n\nIt was concluded in the previous Sections that regardless of the characterization of former President Lee and former President Chen on the political status of the ROC in Taiwan, other States and the United Nations did not consider the ROC a State after it moved to the island of Taiwan. This section will apply State theory and international law discussed in Chapter 2, The State and Sovereignty, to the ROC to see whether it met the requirements of a State after it moved its seat to Taiwan.\n\nAs it was observed in Chapter 2, The State and Sovereignty, a territorial political institution with the required elements of a State becomes a State by an act of declaration. It was also pointed out that after the declaration, for the political institution to establish a State effectively, it must act consistently with the fact that it is a State, i.e., asserting its statehood and acting like a State in international affairs. This section will review the 589 Many people in Taiwan, in particular the Taiwanese politicians, claim that the ROC turned into a State at a certain historical event during the presidency of Lee Teng-hui or Chen Shui-bian. The most common events that have been cited were: (a) the amendment of the Constitution in 1991; (b) the election of Lee Teng-hui as the President by a general election in 1996; (c) the announcement of the \"special state-to-state relationship\" statement by Lee Teng-hui in 1999; and (d) the announcement of the \"two countries each on one side (of the Taiwan Strait)\" statement by Chen Shui-bian. This subsection will examine whether any of the events listed above amounted to an act of declaration of the ROC under Lee Teng-hui or Chen Shui-bian sufficient to establish a new State in international law.\n\na. The Amendment of the Constitution in 1991 When Lee Teng-hui in the 1999 TV interview said that \"The 1991 Amendment to the ROC Constitution designated the cross-Strait relationship as a special state-to-state relationship,\" 591 he seemed to indicate that the ROC turned into a \"State\" by the constitutional amendment, thus, \"there is no need of declaring independence.\" As explained before, the amendments of the Constitution, both in 1991 and 1992, did not change the character of the Nanjing (Nanking) Constitution as a constitution for the entire country of China. A change in the method of electing the President from an indirect election to a general election in 1992 did not make the political institution a new State. Such a change in procedural rules does not effect a change in the substantive status of a political institution.\n\nAdvocates of this view held that the new direct election by the people of the ROC's President and Vice President to replace the indirect election by the National Assembly created a new State. Again, this was simply a change in procedure, rather than a substantive change in the nature of the political institution. If a change in the constitution of the method of electing the President and the Vice President did not create a new State, neither would the implementation of the new method.\n\nc. The Announcement of the \"Special State-to-State Relationship\" Statement by Lee Teng-Hui in 1999 Lee's \"special state-to-state relationship\" statement was not a declaration of independence or a declaration establishing a State. As fully discussed earlier, Lee had no intention to establish a new State limiting its territory to the island of Taiwan. In fact, Lee's statement that there was no need to declare independence in the TV interview negated any interpretation that the statement was itself a declaration of independence. A declaration for the establishment of a new State is a solemn statement and should be open and clear. The purpose of such a declaration is to make the existence of a new state open and unambiguous to the population and other States. Every State has a birthday. A new state cannot gradually evolve into existence. The modern State practice is to make such declaration by the political leader, such as the Executive head of the government, or representatives of the people, such as the legislature, in a document officially executed and announced in public to the international community. Lee's statement, made in an interview by a foreign reporter in a closed chamber, not supported by any formal document, was not a serious declaration, which would establish statehood.\n\nd. The Announcement of the \"Two Countries Each on One Side (of the Taiwan Strait)\" Statement by Chen Shui-Bian Chen's statement was not a declaration establishing a new State either. Chen made the statement to limited attendees of a conference via a closed circuit TV, not to the public in general. Such an oral statement was not qualified as an official declaration establishing a State. Similar to Lee's \"special state-to-state relationship\" statement, Chen's statement was not an open and unambiguous statement to the world of establishing statehood. Additionally, Chen subsequently negated any notion that Taiwan had become a State when he said that he \"[would] not declare independence.\" 592 The above analyses of the events demonstrated that none of them constituted an act of declaration establishing a new State limiting its territory to the island of Taiwan. Thus, there was no point in time or event that the ROC transformed into a State during the tenure of the two ROC Presidents. A comment by the drafters of the Restatement states that \"Taiwan might satisfy the elements of the definition [of a State], but its authorities have not claimed it to be a State, but rather part of the State of China.\" 593 Failure to formerly declare independence prevented the ROC from being a State.\n\nFor a political institution to become a State effectively existing, after it declares establishment of statehood, it must assert statehood in the world community. That neither Lee Teng-hui nor Chen Shui-bian established a new State was evidenced by their subsequent government practice in participating international affairs. Both Presidents asserted that the ROC was an \"independent country.\" If the ROC was a State, its subsequent actions did not match the words. In its attempts to participate the world organizations, the ROC did not assert statehood as illustrated by its attempts to rejoin the United Nations or its participation in the Olympic Games, APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation), and WTO (World Trade Organization).\n\nDuring the presidency of Lee Teng-hui, the ROC began a campaign to join the United Nations. Since December 1971 when the UN General Assembly decided by Resolution No. 2758 that its member State, China, was to be represented by the PRC government, the ROC in Taiwan was shut out from the United Nations and its related organizations. Twentytwo years later, beginning in 1993 when Lee Teng-hui was the President, the ROC attempted to rejoin the United Nations.\n\nImportantly, in its attempt to join the United Nations, the ROC did not apply for a new membership. Under the UN Charter, an application 592 See supra text accompanying note 583. 593 THE RESTATEMENT, supra note 212. '201, Comment f (3d Ed., 1987). by a State to join the United Nations as a new member is to be submitted through the Secretary General's office to the Security Council for approval. Lee Teng-hui did not apply to the Security Council for the ROC to be a new member.\n\nInstead, Lee Teng-hui sought to regain China's seat in the United Nations, which the ROC lost in 1971. Before the UN General Assembly's session in September 1993, the ROC asked friendly countries to submit a request to the General Committee, which was in charge of arranging the General Assembly's annual meeting agenda, to include in the agenda a discussion of the return of \"The Republic of China\" to the United Nations. The General Committee denied the request. From 1994 to 1999, Lee Teng-hui repeated the request each year. Each time, the request was denied.\n\nPresident Chen Shui-bian continued the effort to join the United Nations. Although Chen called the ROC a \"sovereign independent country,\" he did not apply to the United Nations for a new membership either. The ROC again sought to return to China's seat, which was occupied by the PRC government. Like Lee Teng-hui, Chen also sought the assistance of friendly States to send the request for inclusion of the matter in the General Assembly's annual meeting agenda every year. 594 Each year, the General Committee rejected the request.\n\nThe reason which the ROC gave for returning to the United Nations changed many times. In Lee Teng-hui's time, at the beginning, the application challenged Resolution 2758 itself. 595 In 1998, the ROC requested the UN General Assembly to revoke the Resolution, and restore the ROC's rights at the United Nations by allowing the ROC to participate in the United Nations. 596 In 1999, the Lee administration softened the stand and requested to return to the United Nations solely to represent the people of Taiwan. In its supporting documents, the ROC requested the United Nations to allow the State of China to be represented by two governments: the PRC and the ROC. The document claimed that the twenty three-million people under the ROC were not represented in the to either the Security Council or the General Assembly for consideration. Ban cited \"the UN's one-China policy based on Resolution No. 2758\" as his grounds for rejection. 604 The ROC's attempts to join the United Nations have thus far failed. 605 The failure cannot be solely attributed to obstruction by the PRC government. There was a legal aspect in the ROC's applications that was repugnant to the principle of international law. The United Nations is an organization formed by States; only political institutions with statehood may be members. Yet, the ROC government never declared establishment of a new State independent of China and never applied for a new membership as a new State. It just attempted to return to the UN General Assembly to share the China seat with the PRC government. As stated in Chapter 2, The State and Sovereignty, sovereignty is indivisible. Only one government can represent a State. International law does not permit dual representation of a State.\n\nIn its application to join the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (the GATT) and WTO, 609 the ROC did not assert to be a State either. 610 After World War II, in order to promote world trade, 23 States signed the GATT. 611 Initially, all signatories were States. However, some members, particularly the United Kingdom and France, had overseas territories, which, due to their special geographical and economic conditions, would suffer hardships if they were subject to the same customs duty and other import regulations as their parent States. Therefore, GATT was amended to add a new type of membership called \"Customs Territories.\" This type of membership permitted these overseas territories, with the sponsor of their parent States, to join as members and to be treated separately from their parent States. The United Kingdom was a member of GATT and made her territory Hong Kong a Customs Territory for it to join GATT as a separate member. The United Kingdom did this before it handed Hong Kong over to China in 1987 pursuant to an international agreement of 1985. 612 In 1995, GATT transformed into the WTO.\n\nThe ROC attempted to apply for membership of GATT and later the WTO for many years before it was finally admitted in 2002. Although President Lee Teng-hui and President Chen Shui-bian claimed that the ROC was a \"sovereignty[sic] independent country,\" when the ROC applied to join GATT and later the WTO as a member, it did not apply as a State. It could not use the name \"China\" because a great majority of the member States did not regard the ROC as the representative government of China. It did not apply in the name of the \"ROC\" because it was the name of a government and the ROC did not assert that it was a State in international affairs. Thus, the ROC applied as a Customs Territory. The ROC used the name \"The Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu\" in its application. 613 In short, the ROC did not assert that it was a State in the international community, but instead claimed to be just a part of a State, China. In conclusion, other States did not regard the ROC in Taiwan as a State because the ROC did not act as a new State.\n\nThe KMT Party regained political power in 2008. In March 2008, when Chen's term was about to expire, there was a two-way competition in a general election of the ROC President between Hsieh Chang-ting of the DPP Party and Ma Ying-jeou (Ma) of the Chinese Nationalist Party (the KMT). Ma won the election and the KMT Party regained the executive power of the ROC after eight years of the DPP rule.\n\nAfter Ma, a native of Hong Kong (China), assumed the presidency of the ROC in May 2008, he announced that Taiwan was merely a region. There were two implications of the statement that \"Taiwan is a region.\" One was that Taiwan was part of China. By referring to Taiwan as a region, Ma implied that Taiwan was China's territory. The other implication was that the ROC was not a State. He ordered his officials, in dealing with foreign countries, to refer to the island, as \"Chinese Taipei,\" instead of \"the ROC\" or \"Taiwan.\"\n\nTo the Taiwanese people, the illusion that the ROC was a State was shattered overnight. When Ma invited a PRC official Chen Yun-lin in charge of Taiwan Affairs to visit Taipei on November 6, 2008, the national flags of the ROC in the reception hall were removed before Chen's arrival; the Chinese official addressed him \"Mr. Ma,\" not 613 A statement accompanying the application of the Republic of China to join the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) states that \"[t]he Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu (hereinafter referred to as Chinese Taipei) is preparing to accede to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which itself has been reorganized into the World Trade Organization.\" separate identity.\" 617 The position he took was: The ROC was not a State separate from China.\n\nIn 2016, the DPP Party regained the political power in Taiwan.
