{"title": "Artificial infectious disease optimization: A SEIQR epidemic dynamic model-based function optimization algorithm", "body": "Infectious diseases can transmit from a person or any other species to another person or other species through various channels. Usually susceptible individuals can be infected with infectious diseases by directly contacting with infected individuals, body fluids and excreta of infected individuals, or materials polluted by infected individuals; infectious diseases can spread through air, water, food, skin contact, soil, blood, and etc [1] . In nature, there exist a large number of infectious viruses, humans, animals and plants are subjected to their threat all the time. Behind almost every infectious disease, a sad story is always implied. Ebola, outbreak in early 2014, and still raging in Africa, has made thousands of Africans died [2] [3] [4] ; in early 2002, outbreak of SARS had made tens of thousands of Chinese people died, more Chinese people disabled [5] [6] [7] [8] ; H7N9 [9] [10] [11] [12] or H5N6 [13] [14] , which visits southern regions of China every year, makes a lot of poultry slaughtered.\n\nHowever, the purpose of this article is not to introduce a model to describe an infectious disease, but reveals an important application hiding in the spreading mechanism of each infectious disease, namely behind each infectious disease, even it hides an optimization algorithm which can solve some complicated function optimization problems! In other words, an infectious disease actually corresponds to an optimization algorithm. The task of this article is to reveal how this correspondence happens.\n\nSuppose the optimization problem we want to solve is as follows: min f \u00f0X\u00de s:t:\n\nwhere R n is a n-dimensional Euclidean space; X \u00bc(x 1 ,x 2 ,\u2026,x n ) is an n-dimensional decision vector; S is a search space; f(X) is an objective function; g i (X)Z0 is the ith inequality constraint, iA I, I is the set of inequality constraints.\n\nContents lists available at ScienceDirect journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/swevo If f(X) is neither a concave function nor a convex function, or f (X) and g i (X) are discontinuous or non-differentiable, or even their mathematical expressions don't know, then optimization problem (1) can only be solved by heuristic search methods [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , one of which is the population-based intelligence optimization method [21] [22] [23] [24] . For a population-based intelligence optimization algorithm, we always assume that for given X, f(X) and g i (X) can be calculated, while f(X) and g i (X) are always without any restrictions [25] [26] [27] .\n\nUp to now, many population-based intelligence optimization algorithms have been developed, for example, genetic algorithm (GA) [21, 22, 25, [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] , ant colony algorithm (ACA) [33, 34] , particle swarm optimization (PSO) [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] , biogeography-based optimization (BBO) [42] , differential evolution (DE) [43] [44] [45] , artificial bee colony (ABC) [46] [47] [48] [49] , artificial immunity algorithm (AIA) [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] and evolutionary strategy (ES) [57, 58] and so on.\n\nBecause a population-based intelligence optimization algorithm generally doesn't require special restrictions on objective function and constraints of an optimization problem, they have broad suitability and applicability [35] . A common feature of these algorithms is that evolutionary scene is very simple and corresponding operators are very few [35] .\n\nNFL [59, 60] has pointed out, there is not an algorithm that can solve all optimization problems within finite time, but there is an algorithm that can solve some classes of optimization problems, for example, the simplex method can solve all linear programming problems [61] . Though operators contained in a population-based intelligence optimization algorithm are very simple, they are widely researched and applied in the wake of the corresponding algorithm [35] .\n\nEach algorithm can solve some kinds of optimization problems. If cores of these algorithms are extracted and combined into some new operators, then these new operators may have better suitability and wider application. For example, suppose we extract A cores from A algorithms, each core is called as an operation, if we select randomly a operations from the A cores to combine a new operator, then we can obtain C a A new operators. Obviously, the suitability of a new algorithm that possesses of the C a A new operators may be better than that of anyone of the A algorithms; applicable scope of the new algorithm may be wider than that of anyone of the A algorithms.\n\nThe above-mentioned strategy is called as integration in the article.\n\nWhen a population-based intelligence optimization algorithm makes iteration, all variables in an individual, which is the biological explanation of an alternative solution of optimization problem (1), take part in computation simultaneously, we call the iteration strategy as all variables iteration (AVI). AVI means all dimensions of an optimization problem take part in computation simultaneously. The algorithms applying AVI include: GA, PSO, AFSA [62] , BAT [63] , Cuckoo Search (CS) [64] [65] [66] , Glowworminspired Agent Swarms [67] [68] , AIA and its variations [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] , ES [57, 58] , and so on. Because all variables of each alternative solution take part in computation during iteration, a populationbased intelligence algorithm applying AVI may consume more CPU time, its efficiency of computation may be low relatively. Therefore it is not suitable to solve high dimensional optimization problems.\n\nWhen a population-based intelligence optimization algorithm makes iteration, only a very small part of variables in an individual take part in computation simultaneously, we call the iteration strategy as part variables iteration (PVI). PVI means only a few of dimensions of an optimization problem take part in computation simultaneously. The algorithms applying PVI include: DE, BBO, ABC and so on. Because only a small part of variables of an alternative solution during iteration take part in computation, a populationbased intelligence algorithm applying PVI may consume a little of CPU time, its efficiency of computation may be high comparatively, consequently it is suitable to solve some high dimensional optimization problems.\n\nTherefore, developing a PVI-based population-based intelligence algorithm may be a good developing direction.\n\nIf a population-based intelligence optimization algorithm has its heart rhythm, then the algorithm may behave like a live animal. If the heart rhythm of the algorithm is stable, then it means that all operators contained in the algorithm are executed equi-probably; if the heart rhythm throbs (heart palpitation), then it means that a special operator is executed with higher probability under special conditions, a targeted exploration may be realized.\n\nIn a population-based intelligence optimization algorithm, many individuals work together, it is the basic property that a population-based intelligence optimization algorithm differs from a traditional optimization algorithm. In the article, we call the property as synergy, but we assign it much wider implications: synergy may be cooperation, competition, interaction, role changing, state transition and so on [35, [86] [87] [88] .\n\nInformation exchange among individuals is always carried out during iteration in a population-based intelligence optimization algorithm. By information exchange a new search strategy is formed. If information exchange of an algorithm is very sufficient, then the algorithm's performance may be good [35, 46, 57, [62] [63] [64] 87, 88] .\n\nDiversity of individuals in a population-based intelligence optimization algorithm can make individuals to evolve vividly, and then reducing the probability that evolution drops into local pitfalls [69, 70, 87, 88] .\n\nEvolution of population with the survival of the fittest is always the basis of a population-based intelligence optimization algorithm. If there exists evolution in a population, each individual has instincts to make itself to grow better or become stronger [25, [71] [72] [73] [74] , then it means that the algorithm can converge to global optima of optimization problem (1) with higher probability [26, 35, 51, 61, 83, [86] [87] [88] .\n\nSynergy can be transferred into the logic structure of a population-based intelligent optimization algorithm; information exchange can be described into operators of the algorithm; diversity can make search to develop along different directions; while the evolution and instincts of each individual will enable each individual to evolve toward better fitness so as to arrive at global optima at higher probability [26, 35, 51, 61, 74, 83, [86] [87] [88] .\n\nIn nature, is there a scenario which can reflect the abovementioned 8 properties simultaneously, namely integration, PVI, heart rhythm and heart palpitation, synergy, information exchange, diversity, and evolution? The answer is YES.\n\nIn the article, we introduce a new population-based intelligence optimization algorithm by telling the following sad story.\n\nThere are many people in an ecosystem; people always like to eat wild animals. One day, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndromes, SARS [5] [6] [7] [8] ) broke out suddenly within the ecosystem. At first, the SARS virus attacked some people because these people ate some wild animals that had infected with the SARS virus; hence these people were exposed, but did not come on.\n\nBecause SARS can spread by air, and people have the habitual nature of living together in the ecosystem, so the exposed people can easily transmit their diseases to other people. After a period of latency, the exposed people became ill. Because people did not know SRAS at that time, it provided a good opportunity for the virus to spread among people easily and widely. Through closely contacting with the exposed or sick people, many people got infected. After several months, thousands and thousands of people had been infected with SARS, many people died, many people became maimed. A huge fear spread in the ecosystem, all kinds of social and economic activities stopped unavoidably. From the sad story described above, we can find that at some time, some people were not infected with SARS, they are healthy (susceptible) (we call it state S); some people are exposed (we call it state E) because they are just infected with SARS but do not come on after making closely contacting with some exposed or sick people that had been infected with SARS or ate some wild animals infected with SARS; some people became ill (we call it state I) after they had been exposed for a period of time; some people were quarantined (we call it state Q) once they were found to have infected with SARS and became ill; some people were recovered (we call it state R) after they were exposed, infected, quarantined or vaccinated by medical treatment. Each person can only stay at one state at one time, this is to say, all people in the ecosystem were divided into five classes S, E, I, Q and R automatically and dynamically.\n\nThe aforementioned story can be described by an epidemic dynamic model call the SEIQR epidemic model [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] , which is established base on the famous Kermack-Mckendrick bin model [80, 81] . The SARS-based SEIQR model describes the SARS virus attacks human population; any individual in the population may pass through five states: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I), quarantined (Q) and recovered (R).\n\nState S, E, I, Q and R can automatically and dynamically divide all people in the ecosystem into five classes. It is just the diversity the SEIQR epidemic model can provide for us. That people can be attacked by SARS and then transfer their diseases to other people can cause information exchange among people. Information exchange can make a person to transit from one state to another; state transitions can be transformed into operators of the algorithm we introduce in the article. The rules of SARS transmission among people is just the logic to control state transitions of individuals among S, E, I, Q and R, it is just the synergy the SEIQR epidemic model can provide for us. The synergy can be transformed into the logic structure of the algorithm.\n\nState transitions among state S, E, I, Q and R can produce 13 legal state transitions, which will be described in Section 2.4, if these legal state transitions are triggered evenly, then the 13 operators the 13 legal state transitions correspond to are executed equi-probably, a stable heart rhythm is realized. The 13 operators contained in the algorithm provide a native opportunity to integrate many operations with different purposes, and then integration is realized.\n\nBecause SARS can only attack a small part of organs of a person when it spreads among people, an organ corresponds with a variable of an alternative solution of optimization problem (1), PVI can be ingeniously applied, thus enabling the proposed algorithm to possess of high performance of computation, high suitability for solving some kinds of complicated optimization problems, especially high dimensional optimization problems.\n\nBased on the aforementioned discussions, we summarize the following key points:\n\n(1) Synergy. It is realized by the rules of SARS transmission which are described by the Kermack-Mckendrick bin model. (2) Information exchange. When SARS spreads among people, exposed or infected people transmit their virus to other people, making their states to transfer among S, E, I, Q and R, and then information exchange is realized automatically and dynamically. (3) Diversity. Individuals in the SEIQR epidemic model are automatically and dynamically divided into 5 classes, namely class S, E, I, Q and R, individuals in each class can be considered into a subclass of population, and then diversity is realized naturally. (4) Evolution. Each individual in the ecosystem has instincts to survive, which makes itself to grow better or become stronger. (5) Integration. There are 13 operators in the proposed algorithm, thus it provides a good opportunity to integrate some cores of some optimization algorithms together. (6) Heart rhythm. 13 legal state transitions can lead the corresponding 13 operators to execute equi-probably; the curve of a state transition is very similar to that of a person's heart rhythm. If a special operator is found to have high performance when SEIQRA solves a problem, then the operator will be executed with higher probability, a targeted exploration is realized, it is just the heart palpitation. (7) PVI. When SARS attacks people, only a very small part of organs are infected, through test we find that only 1/1000-1/10 of all variables take part in computation, the proposed algorithm can obtain high performance, thus a native reduction of dimensionality is realized.\n\nThe SEIQR epidemic model built based on the Kermack-Mckendrick bin model [32] [33] is an nonlinear mathematical model that describes dynamic behaviors of individuals in random state transition among susceptibility (S), exposure (E), infection (I), quarantine (Q) and recovery (R) under the action of an infectious disease, the model considers an infectious disease not from the perspective of pathological knowledge of the infectious disease, but from the description of spread of the infectious disease, analysis of quantitative change rules of infected individuals and revelation of developmental state of the infectious disease according to general mechanism of transmission of the infectious disease and through the process of quantitative relation [33] [34] [35] , which means that state transitions among state S, E, I, Q and R can be described by mathematical equations based on the Kermack-Mckendrick bin model. That an infectious disease spreads among individuals enables interaction among individuals to be reflected incisively and vividly, the biological meaning of the interaction can be clearly illustrated; what an infectious disease attack is a few of organs of an individual, the phenomenon, when mapped to the situation of searching optimum solutions of an optimization problem, is that the number of variables to be processed at each time deals with only a very small part of all variables. Therefore, the biological meaning of the variables treatment strategy in the algorithm is very clear.\n\nSince the SEIQR epidemic model can appropriately describe epidemic rules of infectious diseases among individuals, which to a large extent, are beneficial to help depict information exchange among many individuals; while an individual is just a biologic explanation of an alternation solution of optimization problem (1); information exchange among many individuals means information exchange among many alternative solutions of optimization problem (1). Therefore the model has unique advantages in solving some complicated function optimization problems. Based on the SEIQR epidemic model in which individuals interact each other, this paper presents a new algorithm for function optimization, namely the SEIQR algorithm, or SEIQRA in short. The paper focuses on solving the following 6 problems:\n\n(1) How to transfer a SEIQR epidemic model into a SEIQR function optimization algorithm that can solve some complicated optimization problems.\n\n(2) How to make the operators in SEIQRA fully reflect the ideas of the SEIQR epidemic model. (3) How to illustrate the convergence of SEIQRA. (4) How to determine the suitable setting of parameters in SEIQRA and analyze the stability of parameter setting in SEIQRA. (5) How to trace dynamic behaviors of the operators in SEIQRA. (6) How to analyze the exploration and exploitation ability of SEIQRA.\n\nThe structure of the article is illustrated in Fig. 1 . In nature, there are many stories that epidemic diseases spread among animals and/or humans, these stories can be described by epidemic dynamic models based on the Kermack and Mckendrick Assumptions [80, 81] . Besides SARS, the SEIQR epidemic model can describe many other infectious diseases; each infectious disease can be transferred into a population-based intelligence optimization algorithm. SEIQRA proposed in the paper provides a reference to convert these stories of infectious diseases into population-based intelligence optimization algorithms.\n\nTo enable SEIRQA to adapt many kinds of optimization problems, the objective function of optimization problems (1) is rewritten as follows:\n\nwhere F max is a very large real number used to punish the alternative solutions that does not satisfy the constraints of optimization problems (1).\n\nThe SEIQR epidemic model [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] can be used to describe diseases like Ebola, SARS, H7N9, H5N6, Dengue and so on. Here we use the model to describe SARS, SARS is an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by the SARS corona virus (SARS-CoV), WHO named it as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [5] . The main way to spread this disease is flying saliva A sad story (an infectious disease attacks human)\n\nKM bin model (Fig.2) can be described by Population-level differential equation set (Formula (3) and (4)) can be illustrated by It is called the SEIQR epidemic dynamic model Individual-level differential equation set (Formula (10) and (11) The SARS virus is discharged out of body through respiratory tract secretions such as oral saliva, sneezing and so on, and spreads through the air; peaks of infection are in the autumn, winter and early spring of a year. The latency period of SARS is 3-5 days; after 10-14 days the disease outbursts, poisoning symptoms such as fever and fatigue worsen, and frequent cough, short breathing or difficulty breathing happens; only with slightly activity, asthma and heart palpitations may occur, patients are forced to stay in bed. The secondary infections of respiratory tract are prone to happen at this period. After 2-3 weeks, heat fades, other signs and symptoms relieve and even disappear; Absorption and recovery of pulmonary inflammatory changes are relatively slow, they need 2 weeks to be absorbed completely back to normal level after body temperature returns to normal.\n\nWhen people establish epidemic dynamic models for some infectious diseases, the bin modeling method represented by Kermack and McKendrick [80, 81] is always used. Based on the method, the SEIQR epidemic model gives the following assumptions [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] :\n\n(1) An human population in an ecosystem is divided into 5 bins (classes): susceptible individuals form class S; the exposed individuals (All those have closely contacted with carriers in the ecosystem, but not come on yet, they are potential onsets) class E; infected but not isolated individuals class I, isolated individuals class Q; recovered individuals that possess of short term of immunity class R; the number of individuals at time t in class S, E, I, Q and R is expressed by S(t), E(t), I(t), Q(t) and R (t). (2) Infected individuals are forcibly isolated once they are found to be infected; the quarantine rate is \u03b4.\n\n(3) Only susceptible individuals are pulsatingly vaccinated, the vaccination rate is p, 0op o1, the cycle of pulsating vaccination is T.\n\n(4) The standard transmission rate \u03b2S(t)I(t) is applied, \u03b2 is the contacting coefficient, 0 o\u03b2o1.\n\nThe latency period of the infectious disease is \u03c4, recovered individuals can obtain immunity. But after a period of time \u03bb, the recovered individuals may lose immunity and transfer into susceptible individuals again, the losing rate of immunity is \u03c1,\n\nAccording to the aforementioned assumptions, the flowchart of the SEIQR epidemic model with time lag and quarantine is shown in Fig. 2 (a) [1, [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] .\n\nIn Fig. 2(a) , A expresses the constant immigration of individuals;\n\n\u03bc the normal mortality rate of individuals; \u03b1 1 , \u03b1 2 and \u03b1 3 the mortality rate of infected, quarantined and exposed individuals because of illness respectively; \u03b3 1 , \u03b3 2 and \u03b3 3 the recovery coefficient of exposed, infected and quarantined individuals respectively. Under the impact of pulsating immunization, the corresponding epidemic model is as follows: dS\u00f0t\u00de dt \u00bc A \u00c0 \u03bcS\u00f0t\u00de\u00c0\u03b2S\u00f0t\u00deI\u00f0t\u00de\u00fe\u03c1R\u00f0t\u00de dE\u00f0t\u00de dt \u00bc \u03b2S\u00f0t\u00deI\u00f0t\u00de\u00c0\u00f0\u03bc\u00fe\u03b3 1 \u00deE\u00f0t\u00de\u00c0\u03b2e \u00c0 \u03bc\u03c4 S\u00f0t \u00c0 \u03c4\u00deI\u00f0t \u00c0 \u03c4\u00de\u00c0\u03b1 3 E\u00f0t\u00de dI\u00f0t\u00de dt \u00bc \u03b2e \u00c0 \u03bc\u03c4 S\u00f0t \u00c0 \u03c4\u00deI\u00f0t \u00c0 \u03c4\u00de\u00c0\u00f0\u03b1 1 \u00fe \u03b3 2 \u00fe \u03bc\u00fe\u03b4\u00deI\u00f0t\u00de dQ \u00f0t\u00de\n\nS\u00f0t \u00fe \u00de \u00bc \u00f01 \u00c0 p\u00deS\u00f0t\u00de E\u00f0t \u00fe \u00de \u00bc E\u00f0t\u00de\n\nSuppose the number of individuals is N(t), then N(t)\u00bc S(t)\u00feE (t) \u00feI(t)\u00fe Q(t) \u00feR(t). For the sake of briefness and quick computation, we do not consider the normal mortality rate of individuals and the mortality rate of infected, quarantined and exposed individuals because of illness, namely let \u03bc\u00bc0, \u03b1 1 \u00bc0, \u03b1 2 \u00bc0, \u03b1 3 \u00bc0, Fig. 2 (b), its corresponding epidemic dynamic model is simplified into the following form: dS\u00f0t\u00de dt \u00bc \u00c0\u03b2S\u00f0t\u00deI\u00f0t\u00de\u00fe\u03c1R\u00f0t\u00de\n\nIn formula (4) and (5), there are population-level state variables S(t), E(t), I(t), Q(t) and R(t), there is no individual information in such a description. The method that population-level state variables S(t), E(t), I(t), Q(t) and R(t) are transferred into individuallevel state variables S i (t), E i (t), I i (t), Q i (t) and R i (t) (i \u00bc1, 2, \u2026, N) is as follows:\n\nFor population-level state variables S(t), E(t), I(t), Q(t) and R(t), we have\n\nFormula (6) means that there are S(t) susceptible individuals, E (t) vaccinated individuals, I(t) infected individuals, Q(t) quarantined individuals, R(t) recovered individuals among N individuals. S(t), E (t), I(t), Q(t) and R(t) are integer number, they are very difficult to process in solving differential equations.\n\nWe rewrite formula (6) as follows:\n\nFormula (7) means that if that the total number of individuals in the ecosystem is 1 unit, then S\u00f0t\u00de N , E\u00f0t\u00de N , I\u00f0t\u00de N , Q \u00f0t\u00de N and R\u00f0t\u00de N are the percentage of susceptible, exposed, infected, quarantined and recovered individuals respectively, they are continuous real number, they are very convenient to process in solving differential equations.\n\nIf we redefine state variables S(t), E(t), I(t), Q(t) and R(t) as the percentage of susceptible, exposed, infected, quarantined and recovered individuals in an ecosystem respectively, then we can rewrite formula (7) as follows:\n\nFormula (8) means that suppose that the total number of individuals in the ecosystem is 1 unit, then S(t), E(t), I(t), Q(t) and R (t) represent the proportion of individuals in class S, E, I, Q and R respectively. So, for each individual in the ecosystem, S(t), E(t), I(t), Q(t) and R(t) represent the probability that the individual belongs to class S, E, I, Q and R respectively, or the probability that the individual stays at state S, E, I, Q and R respectively. Therefore formula (8) can be understood into the individuallevel state equation:\n\nwhere S i (t), E i (t), I i (t), Q i (t) and R i (t) are the probability that an individual stays at state S, E, I, Q and R or belongs to class S, E, I, Q and R.\n\nA similar analysis can be made from formula (3) to formula (5) . At last, which state an individual will stay at? It is defined by the probability distribution of S i (t), E i (t), I i (t), Q i (t) and R i (t). For example, if R i (t) is the maximum one among S i (t), E i (t), I i (t), Q i (t) and R i (t), then the probability of the individual staying at state R is highest.\n\nUsing formula (8) and (9), S i (t), E i (t), I i (t), Q i (t) and R i (t) are changed into continuous real number, population-level state variables S(t), E(t), I(t), Q(t) and R(t) are transferred into individuallevel state variables S i (t), E i (t), I i (t), Q i (t) and R i (t), they can be easily processed in mathematical computation, especially in solving differential equations, the method is widely used in Computational Biology and Population Dynamics.\n\nBased on the aforementioned analysis, we can apply formula (4) and (5) to any individual in an ecosystem, say individual i, formula (4) and (5) can be rewritten into the following discrete iterating form, considering that \u03b2, \u03b3 1 , \u03b3 2 , \u03b3 3 , \u03b4 and p vary with time:\n\ncan be expressed as follows:\n\nThis is because:\n\nIn formula (12), we use S i \u00f0t\u00de\u00feE i \u00f0t\u00de\u00feI i \u00f0t\u00de\u00feQ i \u00f0t\u00de\u00feR i \u00f0t\u00de \u00bc 1. At time t, in formula (10) and (11) , all parameters take their values by \u03b2 t \u00bcRnd(0, \u03b2), \u03b3 t 1 \u00bc Rnd(0, \u03b3 1 ), \u03b3 t 2 \u00bcRnd(0, \u03b3 2 ), \u03b3 t 3 \u00bc Rnd(0, \u03b3 3 ), p t \u00bcRnd (0, p), \u03b4 t \u00bcRnd(0, \u03b4), \u03c1 t \u00bcRnd(0, \u03c1). Rnd(a, b) means to generate a random real number with even distribution within interval [a, b].\n\nSuppose there are N human individuals in an ecosystem, these individuals are numbered with 1, 2, \u2026, N, let P\u00bc {1, 2, \u2026, N}. Each individual is characterized by n features, namely for individual i, its features are (x i1 , x i2 , \u2026, x in ). There exists an infective disease called SARS in the ecosystem, which spreads among some individuals. Individuals will be infected with SARS through closely contacting with flying saliva or respiratory secretions of carriers. The virus just attacks a small part of features of an individual. In order to protect human individuals from SARS, susceptible individuals can be vaccinated. The vaccinated individuals will not be infected during a certain period of time, nor do they disseminate SARS to any other individuals. But the immunity of individuals is temporary, and it will lose effectiveness after a period of time. Then the human individuals without immunity will be infected with the infective disease again. The rules of SARS spreading among individuals are as follows:\n\n(1) If an individuals who stays at susceptibility state S makes close contact with some individuals who have been exposed or infected with SARS, then it will catch the infectious disease. Individuals who are just infected with SARS do not come on at once; their diseases transfer firstly into the latency period, which is called exposure state E. The individuals staying within the latency period can transmit their diseases to other individuals also; these individuals at exposure state E can be cured if they accept medical treatment. (2) After a period of time, some individuals who have stayed at exposure state E become ill, they transfer into infected state I, the individuals stayed in infection state I can transmit their virus to other individuals when they make close contact with them; these individuals at infection state I can be cured if they accept medical treatment. (3) Once an infected individual is found, it will be quarantined at once, namely it moves into quarantine state Q; an infected individual who stays at quarantine state Q will stay at the state until the individual is cured. An individual who stays at state Q cannot spread its disease to any other individuals. (4) If individuals who stay at quarantine state Q are cured, they will enter into recovery state R and obtain a certain period of immunity. Individuals who stay at state R will be not infected within a period of time, so they cannot transmit the infectious disease to other individuals at this period of time. (5) The immunity of individuals who stay at recovery state R may be lost after a period of time, the individuals who lose their immunity will enter into susceptibility state S again; when these individuals contact closely with the exposed or infected individuals, they will become exposed again. (6) In order to prevent SARS to spread casually and widely, some susceptible individuals may be vaccinated cyclically, which is called pulsating vaccination.\n\nStep Table 1 .\n\nThe above-mentioned scenario is mapped onto the process of searching the global optimum solutions of optimization problem (1), its meaning is as follows.\n\nThe search space of optimization problem (1) corresponds to the ecological system, an individual in the ecological system corresponds to an alternative solution of optimization problem (1), the set of alternative solutions N individuals correspond to is X\u00bc\n\ncorresponds to a variable of alternative solution X i of the optimization problem, namely feature j of individual i corresponds to variable x ij of alternative solution X i , so the number of features of individual i is equal to the number of variables of alternative solution X i , they are both n. Therefore, individual i and alternative solution X i are equivalent.\n\nThe physical strength of an individual is represented by individual physique index (IPI), which exactly corresponds to the objective function value of optimization problem (1). Good alternative solutions correspond to individuals with higher IPI values which represent these individuals with strong physique, while bad alternative solutions correspond to individuals with lower IPI values which represent these individuals with weak physique. For optimization problem (1), IPI of individual i is calculated as follows:\n\nAt time t, randomly generate \u03b2 t , \u03b3 t 1 , \u03b3 t 2 , \u03b3 t 3 , p t , \u03b4 t , \u03c1 t of the ecosystem, formula (10) and (11) is used to calculate susceptible probability S i (t), exposure probability E i (t), infection probability I i (t), quarantine probability Q i (t) and recovery probability R i (t) of individual i. At time t, which state individual i stays at among state S, E, I, Q and R is determined by the probability distribution of S i (t), E i (t), I i (t), Q i (t) and R i (t). Legal state transitions of any individual listed in Table 1 meet the situation depicted in Fig. 2 \n\nFor state S, E, I, Q and R, there are 5 \u00c2 5 \u00bc25 possible state transitions among individuals, but legal state transitions that satisfy Fig. 2 (b) are 13, as shown in Table 1 . Except the 13 legal state transitions in Table 1 , other state transitions are illegal. The 13 legal state transitions can be described by 13 operators, as shown in Table 1 . From formula (10) and (11) we can know that susceptible probability S i (t), exposure probability E i (t), infection probability I i (t), quarantine probability Q i (t) and recovery probability R i (t) of individual i vary with time, so the growth state of individual i will transfer randomly among state S, E, I, Q and R. This state transition, when mapped onto the solution space of optimization problem (1), means that each alternative solution in the solution space moves from one location to another, then the random search in the solution space is realized.\n\nDuring the random search process, if IPI of individual i at time t is higher than that at time t \u00c0 1, individual i will continue to grow, which means that individual i is getting closer to global optimum solutions. On the contrary, if IPI of individual i at time t is less than or equal to that at time t\u00c0 1, individual i will stop growing, which means that individual i stays at the position of time t \u00c0 1 and does not move. The random search strategy is called \"each-step-is-notbad\" [83, [86] [87] [88] , it allows the algorithm to converge.\n\nAccording to the scenario design of SEIQRA, the implementation process of SEIQRA is described as follows.\n\n(1) At time t, \u03b2 t , \u03b3 t 1 , \u03b3 t 2 , \u03b3 t 3 , p t , \u03b4 t of a population are generated randomly. At the beginning, t\u00bc0. (2) Use formula (10) and (11) to calculate the susceptibility prob-\n\nThere are five cases as follows: (31) If state S is selected, then it means that at time t individual i stays at state S. At this time we judge at which state individual i stayed at time t \u00c0 1.There are two legal cases:\n\n(a) If at time t \u00c0 1 individual i stayed at state S, then we can know that now individual i stays still at the susceptible state S, namely S-S. In this case we use the S-S operator to calculate the growth state X t i of individual i. (b) If at time t \u00c0 1 individual i stayed at state R, then we can know that now individual i loses its immunity and transfers into susceptible state S, namely R-S. In this case we use the R-S operator to calculate the growth state X t i of individual i. (32) If state E is selected, then it means that at time t individual i stays at state E. At this time we judge at which state individual i stayed at time t \u00c0 1.There are two legal cases:\n\n(a) If at time t \u00c0 1 individual i stays at state E, then we can know that now individual i still stays at the exposed state E, namely E-E. In this case we use the E-E operator to calculate the growth state X t i of individual i. (b) If at time t \u00c0 1 individual i stayed at state S, then we can know that now individual i is infected with SARS but does not come on, namely S-E. In this case we use the S-E operator to calculate the growth state X t i of individual i. (a) If at time t \u00c0 1 individual i stayed at state E, then we can know that now individual i becomes ill after it is exposed (transferring from state E into state I), namely E-I. In this case we use the E-I operator to calculate the growth state X t i of individual i. (b) If at time t \u00c01 individual i stayed at state I, then we can know that now individual i continues to be sick, namely I-I. In this case we use the I-I operator to calculate the growth state X t i of individual i. (a) If at time t \u00c01 individual i stayed at state S, then we can know that now individual i is vaccinated, and it cannot be infected within a time of time, namely S-R. In this case we use the S-R operator to calculate the growth state X t i of individual i. (b) If at time t \u00c0 1 individual i stays at state E, then we can know that now individual i is cured after it is exposed, namely E-R. In this case we use the E-R operator to calculate the growth state X t i of individual i. (c) If at time t \u00c0 1 individual i stayed at state I, then we can know that now individual i is cured after it is infected, namely I-R. In this case we use the I-R operator to calculate the growth state X t i of individual i. (d) If at time t \u00c0 1 individual i stayed at state Q, then we can know that now individual i is cured and obtains a certain period of immunity simultaneously after it is isolated, namely Q-R. In this case we use the Q-R operator to calculate the growth state X t i of individual i. (e) If at time t\u00c0 1 individual i stayed at state R, then we can know that now individual i does not lose its immunity and still stays at state R, namely R-R. In this case we use the R-R operator to calculate the growth state X t i of individual i. Step (2) to (4) until each individual is processed, then go to Step (6).\n\n(6) Let t\u00bc t\u00fe1.Repeat\n\nStep (1) to (5) until the global optimum solution is found.\n\nAt time t, the initial values of N individuals in the ecosystem are\n\nwe give the design method of the 13 ecological operators listed in Table 1 .\n\nIn GA [21, 22, 25, [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] , when two chromosomes carry out crossover operation, male and female chromosome are randomly selected from many chromosomes; position of crossover in each chromosome is randomly selected also. The idea that results from genetics, but do not fully abide by genetics can greatly simplify the design of GA, the method is widely used in population-based intelligence optimization algorithms.\n\nSimilarly, in SEIQRA, we assume that state R, its all features are not only immunized, but also are cured.\n\nIndividual i can be described with the following structure:\n\nBased on the Fig. 2 (b), we can find the general method to explain each state transition and update SEIQR i (t) and X t i of individual i, and define the biological meaning of transition types. By decomposing Fig. 2(b) , we obtain the following two cases:\n\n(1) At time t, an individual can transfer from state A to state B, as shown in Fig. 3 we can make the individual to get exposed, namely state transition S-E is achieved. This strategy means that some exposed or infected individuals transfer their own something with virus to a susceptible individual, making it to get exposed. When an individual stays at state A, in order to enable the individual to evolve towards good direction, but its state remains the same, we will let the composite state values of some features of several strong individuals whose IPI values are higher than that of the individual transfer to the corresponding features of the individual, namely strong individuals with higher IPI transfer strong feature information to weak individuals with lower IPI so as to make these weak individuals to grow for the better direction. The reason is that when individuals stay at susceptible, exposed, infected, isolated or recovery state, they always makes their own physique to be improved by keeping in good health, health care, training or other ways; when individuals stay at state of illness, they always make their own physique to be enhanced through medical treatment and nutritional supplement so as to achieve the goal of conquer disease.\n\nAfter state transitions are explicitly expressed according to Fig. 3 , the flowchart shown in Fig. 2 (b) can be illustrated as Fig. 4 .\n\nFor state transition A-B, we randomly select L individuals from those who have stayed at state B, let the composite state value of a randomly selected feature j of the L individuals be transferred to the corresponding feature j of current individual i who stays at state A, then the individual obtains the similar properties with the individuals staying at state B. Thus, state transition A-B is realized, namely\n\nWhere i 1 , i 2 , \u2026, i L are the numbers of the L randomly selected individuals who have stayed at state B; function f expresses the method of combining the state value of feature j of the L individuals, it produces a new state value of feature j, the new state value will be transferred to the corresponding feature j of current individual i staying at state A; f is equivalent to a mixer, and can be defined according to Section 2.4.2.\n\nFor state transition A-A, we randomly select L strong individuals from those who have stayed at state A but their IPI values are higher than that of current individual i; let the composite state value of a randomly selected feature j of the L strong individuals be transferred to the corresponding feature j of current individual i who stays at state A, then the individual may become stronger also, but its state does not transfer. Thus, state transition A-A is realized. Namely\n\nwhere s 1 , s 2 , \u2026, s L are the numbers of the L strong individuals, but IPI values of the L strong individuals are higher than that of individual i.\n\nFunction f mentioned in Section 2.4.1 is defined as average, differential, expansion, chevy, reflection and crossover operation.\n\nAt time t \u00c0 1, suppose the set C t \u00c0 1 of individuals that satisfy given requirements, the current individual is i, its affected feature is j, then the design methods of average, differential, expansion, chevy, reflection and crossover operation are as follows:\n\n(1) Average Operation AVG(C t \u00c0 1 , i, j). Randomly select L individuals from C t \u00c0 1 , let the state values of feature j of the L individuals are averaged to produce a new compound value by use of average operation, the new value is transferred to the corresponding feature j of individual i at time t, enabling individual i to have similar properties with the individuals in C t \u00c0 1 , namely \n\nObviously, the differential operation is the core of DE [43] [44] [45] .\n\nRandomly select an individual from C t \u00c0 1 , let the state value of feature j of the individual is expanded to produce a new compound value by use of expansion operation, the new value is transferred to the corresponding feature j of individual i at time t, enabling individual i to have similar properties with the individual in C t \u00c0 1 , namely\n\nwhere if jC t \u00c0 1 j 40, then individual k is randomly selected from C t \u00c0 1 , namely k A C t \u00c0 1 ; if C t \u00c0 1 \u00bc 0, then let k\u00bc i gBest , i gBest is the number of the best individual up to time t \u00c01; r 1 \u00bc Rnd ( \u00c0 1,1). Obviously, the expansion operation is the core of ABC [46] [47] [48] [49] . (4) Chevy Operation CHV(C t \u00c0 1 , i, j). Find the best individual i lBest in C t \u00c0 1 , let the state value of feature j of the best individual is chevyed to produce a new compound value by use of chevy operation, the new value is transferred to the corresponding feature j of individual i at time t, enabling individual i to have similar properties with the individual in C t \u00c0 1 , namely\n\nwhere i lBest A C t \u00c0 1 ; r 2 \u00bc Rnd(0.4,0.6), r 3 \u00bc1.3Rnd(0,1), r 4 \u00bc1.8Rnd (0,1). Obviously, the chevy operation is the core of PSO [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . (5) Reflection Operation RFL(C t \u00c0 1 , i, j). Randomly select 2 individuals from C t \u00c0 1 , let the state values of feature j of the 2 individual are reflected to produce a new compound value by use of reflection operation, the new value is transferred to the corresponding feature j of individual i at time t, enabling individual i to have similar properties with the individuals in\n\nIf |C t \u00c0 1 | 41, then i 1 and i 2 are randomly selected from C t \u00c0 1 , \n\nObviously, the crossover operation is the core of RC-GA [32] .\n\nAt time t \u00c01, randomly select L individuals from the susceptible, exposed, infected, quarantined and recovered individuals respectively to form the following sets:\n\nThe set of susceptible individuals:\n\nThe set of exposed individuals:\n\nn o Table 2 Design of operators in SEIQRA.\n\nS-S S -S Average operation/differential operation\n\nThe set of infected individuals:\n\nn o\n\nThe set of quarantined individuals:\n\nThe set of recovered individuals:\n\nAt time t \u00c0 1, randomly select L individuals whose IPI values are higher than that of current individual i from the susceptible, exposed, infected, quarantined and recovered individuals respectively to form the following sets:\n\nThe set of strong susceptible individuals:\n\nThe set of strong exposed individuals:\n\nThe set of strong infected individuals:\n\nThe set of strong quarantined individuals:\n\nThe set of strong recovered individuals:\n\nn o\n\nFor each operator, its standard structure is as follows:\n\nOperatorX\n\nExecute operation B;\n\nFor each state transition listed in Table 1 , its corresponding operator and the match of operation A and B are shown in Table 2 .\n\nBy careful arrangement, each operation in Table 2 has the same probability 1/6 to be executed. The meaning of elements in Table 2 is explained as follows:\n\nFor state transition S-S, its corresponding operator is S-S, the structure of the operator is as follows:\n\nOperator S-S IFRnd(0,1) o0.5 THEN Execute average operation: AVG(C t \u00c0 1 PS , i, j); ELSE Execute differential operation: DE(C t \u00c0 1 PS , i, j);\n\nFor state transition S-R, its corresponding operator is S-R, the structure of the operator is as follows:\n\nOperator S-R IFRnd(0,1) o1/6 THEN Execute average operation: DE(C t \u00c0 1 R , i, j); ELSE IFRnd(0,1) o2/6 THEN Execute differential operation: EPN(C t \u00c0 1 R , i, j); ELSE IFRnd(0,1) o3/6 THEN Execute differential operation: CHV(C t \u00c0 1 R , i, j); ELSE IFRnd(0,1) o4/6 THEN Execute differential operation: RFL(C t \u00c0 1 R , i, j); ELSE IFRnd(0,1) o5/6 THEN Execute differential operation: CRS(C t \u00c0 1 R , i, j); Table 3 The strategy of taking values of the parameters in SEIQRA.\n\nThe maximum periods: G G is used to prevent the iteration from dropping into infinite looping when the convergence condition is not satisfied, generally G \u00bc 8000-300,000. The lowest error: \u03b5 \u03b5 4 0, the smaller the \u03b5 is, the higher the precision of the found optimum solution will be, but the longer the calculation time will be, generally the scope of value is \u03b5 \u00bc 10 -5 -10 \u00c0 10 . The number of variables: n n is defined by the actual optimization problem to be solved. The number of work individuals: N Although N taking larger value can expand the search scope, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is proportional to N, therefore N cannot be made too large, the precision of the parameter value is without too high, simply on the basis of the specific optimization problem and the speed of your computer, and range of value for N is 100-2000. The number of individuals that join in information exchange: L LZ 1, the parameter is not sensitive, generally L \u00bc 6 The biggest probability that a feature of an individual is attacked by an infectious disease: E 0 0o E 0 o1, at every step of evolution, only a part of features are allowed to be attacked by an infectious disease. if n is smaller, then E 0 \u00bc 1/200-1/20; if n is bigger, then E 0 \u00bc 1/500-1/1000 Latency period: \u03c4 Always set \u03c4 \u00bc 1 Immunity period: \u03bb Always set \u03bb \u00bc 1 Vaccination cycle: T Always set T \u00bc 4 The upper limit of the SEIQR epidemic model's parameters \u03b2, \u03b3 1 ,\n\nThe initialization number of individuals: N 0 N 0 Z 10,000 The allowable maximum generations the global optimization solution keeps unchanged: t max t max \u00bc 10-100\n\nThe shrinking factor: \u03c1 0o \u03c1 o1, generally \u03c1 \u00bc 0. For an individual, compare its new generation with its current generation, replace the current generation with the new generation if the latter are better than the former; otherwise keep the former unchanged. For optimization problem (1), operator growth can be described as follows:\n\nWhere function IPI(V t i ) and IPI(X t i ) are calculated according to formula (13) . The operator growth possesses of the property of \"each-step-is-not-bad\", ensuring the algorithm to converge globally [83, [86] [87] [88] .\n\nSuppose that the dimensionality of the search space of optimization problem (1) is n, the search interval for each variable is [l i , u i ], i\u00bc1, 2, \u2026, n, the constructing operator INIT of the orthogonal table L N (N n ) that uses the orthogonal Latin squares generating method [82] to produce N initial solutions is as follows:\n\nStep 1: Calculate discrete points for each variable y ij : When all individuals drop into stick state, search will stop automatically; global optimization solution will keep unchanged forever. On the other way, when some problems have high condition numbers, enhancing precision of global optima is always difficult when individuals easily drop into sticky state. At this time, a reinitialization-redistribution of individuals is necessary.\n\nSuppose from time t 0 to time t, global optimization solution keeps unchanged, we say that evolution has dropped into stick state. Reinitialization-redistribution of individuals will make search to escape from stick state or get high precision global optima. The operator of reinitialization-redistribution of individuals (Operator REINIT) is designed as follows:\n\n2.4.3.3.1. Operator REINIT. If t \u00c0 t 0 4t max , where t max is the allowable maximum periods that global optimization solution keeps unchanged, then execute the following operations:\n\nStep 1: (Decrease the interval of each decision variable): Decrease the interval LU i of decision variable x i (i \u00bc1, 2, \u2026, n) by LU i \u00bc\u03c1LU i , where \u03c1 is the shrinking factor of the interval of decision variable x i , 0o\u03c1o1; LU i is its change limit. At start,\n\nLU 0 is the lower bound of interval shrinkage; the smaller LU 0 is, the narrower the scope of search is, and the higher the precision of optimum solutions will be, but the scope of search may not cover global optimum solutions.\n\nStep 2: (Operation reinitialization: Reinitialize a very big number of individuals): Take each variable x \u00c3 i (i \u00bc1, 2, \u2026, n) of the current global solution X \u00c3 \u00bc \u00f0x \u00c3 1 ; x \u00c3 2 ; \u22ef; x \u00c3 n \u00de T as center, namely for x \u00c3 i (i \u00bc1, 2, \u2026, n), its change extent is within\n\nas the interval of variable x i of individual X i , use the above-mentioned operator INIT to initialize all N 0 individuals; N 0 can assign a very larger number, for example, N 0 \u00bc2000 or even much bigger number.\n\nStep 3: (Operation redistribution: Redistribute a small number of individuals): Find the new best individual X \u00c30 \u00bc \u00f0x \u00c30\n\n1 ; x \u00c30 2 ; \u22ef; x \u00c30 n \u00de T from the just initialized N 0 Individuals; then redistribute N individuals within x \u00c30 i \u00c0 LU i ; x \u00c30 i \u00feLU i \u00c2 \u00c3 by the above-mentioned algorithm INIT, where N is the number of work individuals used by SEIQRA, N\u00abN 0 , for example N \u00bc 50-200.\n\nStep 4: (Replace the individuals with lower IPI values according to ratio r): Replace the current individuals whose IPI values are very low with the newly-generated individuals whose IPI values are very high, the ratio of replacement is r. For example, when r \u00bc0.5, it means that 50% of the current individuals, whose IPI values are very low among all the current individuals, are replaced with 50% of the newly-generated individuals, whose IPI values are very high among all the newly-generated individuals.\n\nReinitialization of a very big number of individuals is used to find the approximate position of global optima; in the vicinity of the approximate position of global optima, redistribution of a small number of work individuals is easy to find the global optima quickly and accurately by the algorithm SEIQRA.\n\nConclusively, operation reinitialization is good at enhancing precision of an optimum solution, while operation redistribution is good at breaking sticky state of an individual. Table 4 The time complexity of SEIQRA.\n\nAverage time complexity \n\nOutput of results O(n) 1\n\nBased on the logical structure of Algorithm SEIQRA mentioned in Section 2.3, we can design a simple structure of SEIQRA as follows:\n\nAlgorithm SEIQRA Initialize all the parameters SEIQRA involves as specified in Table 3 ; FORt \u00bc1 TOG //Where t is used to count generations or periods of evolution; G is the maximum generations or periods of evolution. FOR each individual i Step 1: Calculate the state transition probability of the individual by state transition Eqs. (10) and (11);\n\nStep 2: Determine which state s the individual may transfer to at time t based on its state transition probability computed by Step1;\n\nStep 3: If state transition from time t \u00c01 to time t is legal, then carry out information exchange by transferring some features of some randomly-selected individuals at time t\u00c0 1 to the corresponding features of the individual at time t; else the state of the individual keeps unchanged.\n\nStep 4: Compute the IPI value of the individual by formula (13), if its IPI value is improved when comparing to that at time t \u00c01, then the individual evolves to the new state s at time t; else the individual still stay at its old state at time t \u00c0 1.\n\nOperator REINIT is activated at certain frequency;\n\nThe psuedo-code of SEIQRA can be seen in Appendix A. The strategy of taking values of the parameters in SEIQRA is shown in Table 3 .\n\nThe time complexity of SEIQRA is evaluated as shown in Table 4 \n\nThe computer used to test is a Toshiba notebook computer, its CPU is Intel Core\u2122 I5, M520 @ 2.40 GHz, its memory size is 4 GB, its OS is Windows 7.\n\nNow we use the Bump function F 0 (X) [35] and Michalewicz function F 1 (X) [35] as an example to test the performance of Table 5 Properties of the Bump function F 0 (X) and Michalewicz function F 1 (X).\n\nBump function F 0 (X) Michalewicz function F 1 (X)\n\nOptimization problem with constraints? SEIQRA, and determine the setting of some key parameters. The mathematical models of F 0 (X) and F 1 (X) are as follows:\n\nBump function:\n\nMichalewicz function:\n\nThe two functions are carefully selected because they have such properties as shown in Table 5 .\n\nThe reason we select the Bump and Michalewicz function to determine the setting of parameters in SEIQRA is that properties of the two functions have a typical representative in engineering applications, and hence the generalized configuration of Table 7 Effect of parameter E 0 when n\u00bc 50, L \u00bc 6, N \u00bc 200, N 0 \u00bc2000, G \u00bc 1.0E \u00fe5, T \u00bc4, \u03bb\u00bc 1, \u03c4 \u00bc 1, and run times \u00bc20; REINT is prohibited. parameters in SEIQRA can be approximately found by the two functions. Fig. 5 is the graphs of the Bump and Michalewicz function when n \u00bc2. When n is greater, the Bump and Michalewicz function are very difficult to optimize.\n\nTo make clear that the setting of parameters in SEIQRA gives influence on its evolving process when it solves the Bump and Michalewicz function, a deep investigation is made into the important parameters such as L, E 0 , N, T, \u03c4 and \u03bb. Table 6 describes the relationship among average best objective function value, parameter L and average CPU time; Fig. 6 shows that relation of objective function value with CPU time when L takes different values. Table 6 and Fig. 6 show that when L is valued differently, for the Bump function there is little difference in CPU time, for the Michalewicz function there is great difference in CPU time for some Ls; but when L 41, there is little difference in precision of average optimum objective function values. Therefore, for SEIQRA, L \u00bc2-10 is more appropriate, we suggest L \u00bc6 is the best setting based on comprehensive consideration of precision of objective function value and CPU time. Table 7 describes the relationship among parameter E 0 , average best objective function value and average CPU time. It shows that for the Bump function, when E 0 \u00bc0.008-0.2, the precision is relatively high, but CPU time increases moderately; when E 0 40.2, CPU time varies greatly, but the precision decreases greatly also; especially when E 0 \u00bc1, it is unable to obtain the optimum solution; for the Michalewicz function, when E 0 \u00bc0.001-0.1, the precision is relatively high, but CPU time varies greatly; when E 0 40.1, CPU time varies greatly, but the precision decreases greatly also; especially when E 0 \u00bc1, it is unable to obtain the optimum solution. Therefore, when E 0 \u00bc0.008-0.1, SEIQRA performs best. When E 0 \u00bc0.008-0.1, it means that there are at most only 0.8%-10% variables to be involved in computation, but the CPU time consumed by SEIQRA is lower than that when E 0 takes other values, 7 , which is logarithmic scales on vertical and horizontal axis, shows the relation of IPI (objective function value can be transformed into IPI value with formula (13)) with CPU time when E 0 takes different values. From Fig. 7 we can see that when E 0 increases from 0.0001 to 1, the ascending rate of IPI value, which corresponds to the descending rate of objective function value, increases greatly, but the precision of objective function value decreases moderately; from which we can find that the most suitable value for E 0 is E 0 \u00bc0.06. Table 8 describes the relation among parameter N, average best objective function value and average CPU time consumed by SEIQRA; Fig. 8 shows the relation of objective function value with CPU time when N takes different values. From Table 8 and Fig. 8 , we can see that for average objective function value, when N increases, the precision of the average objective function value increases a little; for average CPU time, when N increases, the average CPU time increases greatly. Therefore, N \u00bc 150-350 is the most suitable setting, we suggest N \u00bc200 is the suitable setting based on comprehensive consideration of precision of objective function value and CPU time.\n\nTables 9-11 show relation of average objective function value with average CPU time under different vaccination cycles, latency periods and immunity periods respectively; Figs. 9-11 show relation of objective function value with CPU time under different Table 9 Relation of average best objective function value with average CPU time under different vaccination cycles T when n\u00bc 50, Table 11 Relation of average best objective function value with average CPU time under different immunity periods \u03bb when n\u00bc 50, vaccination cycles, latency periods and immunity periods respectively. From Tables 9-11 and Figs. 9-11 we can see that for different vaccination cycles, latency periods and immunity periods, average objective function value and average CPU Time do not change greatly. The reason is that the 6 operations are executed equiprobably, the time consumption is almost the same for different vaccination cycles, latency periods and immunity periods. We suggest T \u00bc4, \u03c4\u00bc1 and \u03bb\u00bc1 are the best setting based on comprehensive consideration of precision of objective function value and CPU time.\n\nSince in an ecosystem, \u03b2 t , \u03b3 t 1 , \u03b3 t 2 , \u03b3 t 3 , p t , \u03b4 t and \u03c1 t of population fluctuate with time, therefore, optimum objective function value obtained by SEIQRA always fluctuates in the vicinity of theoretical optimum objective function value. In order to increase precision of optimal objective function value, each setting of parameters should be made reasonably and allow SEIQRA to run many times. Table 12 shows that relation among n (the number of variables of optimization problem (1)), average best objective function value and average CPU time. From Table 12 we can see that when n increases, the consumed CPU time increases greatly, but the precision of objective function value decreases a little also. Fig. 12 describes the convergence graphs when n takes different values. Owing to the \"each-step-is-not-bad\" search strategy, the convergence process of SEIQRA is fairly smooth [83, [86] [87] [88] .\n\nThe parameters in SEIQRA are classified into three classes, namely (1) Class A: the basic parameters a population-based intelligent optimization algorithms may possess of: G (or \u03b5) and N;\n\n(2) Class B: the parameters associated with the SEIQRA epidemic model: L, E 0 , T, \u03c4 and \u03bb;\n\n(3) Class C: the parameters associated with operator REINIT: N 0 , t max , \u03c1, LU 0 , r;\n\nThe parameters in Class A is a basis; the parameters in Class B is very important for SEIQRA, but L, T, \u03c4 and \u03bb produce little influence on precision of the best objective function value and CPU time, so L, T, \u03c4 and \u03bb can take fixed values; the parameters in Class C is not important for SEIQRA. If REINIT is prohibited, then the parameters in Class C do not need to be set.\n\nThe standard parameter configuration in SEIQRA is as follows:\n\n(1) G \u00bc1.0E\u00fe 5, N \u00bc150-350, generally N \u00bc200, \u03b5 is defined by the engineering problem to be solved.\n\n(2) Always set L \u00bc6, T\u00bc 4, \u03c4\u00bc1 and \u03bb\u00bc1.\n\n(3) Set E 0 \u00bc 0.06(for low dimensional problems) or E 0 \u00bc0.001(for high dimensional problems). Conclusively, when SEIQRA solves a problem, only does 1/10-1/1000 of variables of the problem need to take part in computation in each iteration.\n\nIf we want to enhance the probability of finding global optima, we only increase N 0 , for example, set N 0 \u00bc20,000, the probability of finding global optima will be increased greatly; if we want to enhance the precision of global optima, we can only decrease LU 0 to much lower level than \u03b5.\n\nWe use 28 benchmark functions listed in CEC'2013 [85] to test the scalability of SEIQRA, these benchmarks are F1-F28, as shown in Table 13 . The benchmark functions that we minimized are functions that are representative of those used in the literature of performance analysis of populations-based optimization algorithms. More information about these functions can be found in [85] . In Table 13 , D is dimensions of an optimization problem, here D\u00bcn; O is an n-dimensional decision vector. Table 14 shows biases of theoretical global optimum objective function values of F1-F28. We use SEIQRA to solve 28 benchmark functions listed in Table 13 , the results are shown in Table 15 , the setting of parameters used in SEIQRA are D\u00bcn\u00bc 10, 30, 50, \u03b5\u00bc1.0E\u00c012, E 0 \u00bc 0.06, L\u00bc6, T\u00bc 4, \u03c4\u00bc1, \u03bb\u00bc1, N\u00bc200, N 0 \u00bc2000, t max \u00bc30, \u03c1\u00bc0.8, LU 0 \u00bc\u03b5, r\u00bc 0.8, G\u00bc2.0E\u00fe5 and run times\u00bc20; parameterM1 and M2 in F1-F28 are set according to the method mentioned in article [85] ; For convenience of analysis, let O is randomly generated; REINIT is invoked for some benchmark functions.\n\nFrom Tables 15-17 we can see that SEIQRA can solve F1-F28 when n\u00bc10, 30 and 50, it means the algorithm has good scalability.\n\nWe choose another 7 population-based optimization algorithms to make comparison to solve F1-F28; these algorithms include Real Code Genetic Algorithm (RC-GA) [32] , Differential Ant-Stigmergy Algorithm (DASA) [84] , Non-parametric Particle Swarm Optimization (NP-PSO) [38] , Biogeography-based Optimization (BBO) [42] , Differential Evolution (DE) [89] , Self-adaptive Differential Evolution (SaDE) [43] , and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) [47] .\n\nWhen calculating, the setting of parameters in the 7 population-based optimization algorithms is initialized according to Table 18 .\n\nThe algorithms are run independently 20 times for each benchmark function and average best objective function value, standard deviation (STD), median of the best objective function values, CPU time for finding the best objective function value, and rank of each algorithm are reported in Table 19 . The algorithms are ranked based on Rank 1 and Rank 2 in Table 19 . Rank 1 is based on precision of average best objective function value; Rank 2 is based on precision of average best objective function value and CPU time. From Table 19 we can see that the ranks of SEIQRA, RC-GA, NP-PSO, BBO, DE, SaDE and ABC based on precision or precision and CPU time are as follows: Also, the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test [38, 89] is conducted between the SEIQRA's result and the best results achieved by the other 7 algorithms listed in Table 18 for each benchmark function to determine whether the results generated by SEIQRA are statistically different from the results obtained by the other algorithms. With the help of the famous statistical Table 20 , where hvalue \u00bc 1 indicates that the performances of SEIQRA is statistically different with 99% certainty, h-value \u00bc \u00c01 represents that the compared algorithm are significantly better than SEIQRA, and hvalue \u00bc0 denotes that the results of the two considered algorithms are not significantly different. In Table 20 , rows 1(Better), 0 (Same), and \u00c0 1 (Worse) give the number of benchmark functions that SEIQRA performs significantly better than, almost the same as, and significantly worse than the compared algorithm, respectively. From Table 20 we can know that SEIQRA performs significantly better than the other 7 algorithms.\n\nAppendix B illustrates the sample convergence curves of SEIQRA, RC-GA, NP-PSO, BBO, DE, SaDE and ABC when they solve benchmark F1-F28. In order to highlight the change of these sample convergence curves, the horizontal and vertical axis are illustrated with logarithmic scale.\n\nAnalysis of dynamic behaviors of operators in SEIQRA is as follows: The stability of the heart rhythm of SEIQRA is controlled by parameters \u03b2 0 , \u03b3 1 , \u03b3 2 , \u03b3 3 , p and \u03b4; when these parameters are set according to Table 3 , the stability of the heart rhythm of SEIQRA is guaranteed.\n\nSEIQRA possesses of 6 operations AVG, DE, EPN, CHV, RFL and CRS. The times of each operation being executed varies with time. Fig. 15 describes that the relationship of the times of each operation being executed with the CPU time when SEIQRA solves F1. It shows that the times of each operation being executed vary stochastically with time, but the average times of each operation being executed is also stable because the average times of each operation being executed approximates to level.\n\nThe dynamic behavior of REINIT is controlled by N 0 , t max , \u03c1, LU 0 and r. REINIT is used to enhance the exploration and exploitation ability of SEIQRA. REINIT includes two operations: reinitialization and redistribution, as mentioned in Section 2.4.3.3.\n\nAt stage of operation reinitialization, a large number of individuals are used to reinitialize a search space, After reinitialization, if a new global optimum solution is found, it means that the activation of REINIT is effective, we call it the effective triggering point, the current global optimum solution is updated into the newlyfound global optimum solution; else the current global optimum solution keeps unchanged. The property of REINIT is called as the exploitation ability of REINIT.\n\nAt stage of operation redistribution, a small number of individuals are used to reinitialize the search space determined by the current global optimum solution. After redistribution, a normal search is made by SEIQRA. The positions of the work individuals are always updated no matter whether the current global optimum solution is updated or not. Therefore sticky states of search may be broken. The property of REINIT is called as the exploration ability of REINIT.\n\nDuring searching process of SEIQRA, the identification of effectiveness of REINIT is illustrated in Fig. 16 , where ALM is the IPI convergence curve when SEIQRA solves an optimization problem; the series of points marked by circle is the assigned triggering points, namely at that time REINIT is invoked; point K is the starting time that REINIT is allowed to invoke; KN is a line constructed by use of the effective triggering points; point B is the first assigned triggering point, point C is the second assigned triggering point, \u2026, point J is the last assigned triggering point; the series of the effective triggering points is marked by numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Number 1 means the assigned triggering point C takes effect because the current global optimum solution is updated. Similarly, Numbers 2, 3, 4 and 5 mean that points D, E, G and I take effect respectively. Therefore, C, D, E, G and I are effective triggering points, while points B, F, H, J are ineffective triggering points.\n\nIt is noteworthy that all assigned triggering points can always change positions of work individuals. Therefore it can help a search to overcome sticky states.

When SEIQRA solves benchmark function F14, from Fig. 17(a) we can see that at 3 s, REINIT is invoked; at 95 s, the first assigned triggering point is produced; at 99 s, the first effective triggering point is produced. When search is approximate to the global optimum solution of F14, three effective triggering points are produced; when SEIQRA solves benchmark function F6, from Fig. 17(b) we can see that at 2 s, REINIT is invoked; at 592 s, the first assigned triggering point is produced; at 1009 s, the first effective triggering point is produced. When search is approximate to the global optimum solution of F6, a larger number of effective triggering points are produced; it means that REINIT continues to enhance the precision of the global optimum solution. Fig. 18 illustrates a special case when SEIQRA solves basic benchmark function F18. From Fig. 18 we can see that at 3 s, REINIT is invoked; at 57 s, the first assigned triggering point is produced. But no effective triggering points are generated during the whole process of search, it means that REINIT is only used to break sticky states of work individuals, namely operation reinitialization does not take effect, while operation redistribution takes effect.\n\nWhen an optimization problem can be solved without the help of REINIT, if the operator is invoked forcibly, then the convergence rate of solving the problem may be decreased because continuous triggering of REINIT can consume much CPU time. Fig. 19 illustrates a comparison of the convergence rate between \"REINIT is not invoked\" and \"REINIT is invoked\" when SEIQRA solves basic benchmark function F3. From Fig. 19 we can see that the convergence rate when REINIT is not invoked is faster than that when REINIT is invoked; as time lapses, triggering of REINIT become more and more frequent, much time is consumed for triggering REINIT. Conclusively, REINIT has two effects of the pros and cons, it can enhance the exploration and exploitation ability of SEIQRA, but it may consume much CPU time. Therefore, we suggest that if an optimization problem can be solved without REINIT, REINIT should be prohibited; if sticky states always occur when SEIQRA solves an optimization problem, REINIT should be invoked.\n\nIn SEIQRA, Individuals come from one population; operators S-S, S-E, S-R, E-E, E-I, E-R, I-I, I-Q, I-R, Q-Q, Q-R, R-R and R-S are constructed based on the SEIQR epidemic model, they are not related to any actual optimization problems to be solved. Because the SEIQR epidemic model does not require the support of pathological knowledge, SEIQRA does not require the support of pathological knowledge also, this characteristic is beneficial to the research and improvement of SEIQRA.\n\nIn conclusion, SEIQRA has the following properties:\n\n1. The stable rhythm of heart: the stable rhythm of heart in SEIQRA can ensure the ecological operators to be activated evenly. 2. Exploration and exploitation ability: it is represented by operator REINIT, which is activated at certain frequency to improve exploration and exploitation ability. 3. Wide adaptability: if an operator can solve one type of optimization problems, then synergy of many operators can solve many types of optimization problems. Because SEIQRA has 13 operators, it has wider adaptability to solve different types of optimization problems. 4. A small part of variables being involved in each iteration: Since a virus attacks only a small part of individual features every time, when individuals in different states exchange their feature information, there is just a small portion of features used in computation, even so, the individual's IPI can still be well improved. Owing to the substantial reduction of features in calculation, when solving complicated optimization problems, especially high-dimensional optimization problems, SEIQRA can converge significantly and rapidly. 5. The stable setting of parameters: Although SEIQRA uses more parameters to control its running, the setting of its parameters is stable. 6. Multiple operations: Because SEIQRA possesses of 13 operators, it provides opportunities to contain many operations simultaneously. 7. Convergence: When evolving, the individuals with strong physique can continue to grow, while the individuals with weak physique will stop growing. This kind of search strategy can ensure global optima to be found at higher probability.\n\n8. Visualization: The story-based design of SEIQRA makes it easy to visualize its process of evolution when solving an optimization problem. SEIQRA has characteristics of high adaptability, fast solving speed and convergence for complicated function optimization problems. Besides these, precision of global optimal solutions can also be improved by operator REINIT. These characteristics of SEIQRA may facilitate practical applications. Further study in the future includes: (1) How to use the mechanisms of immunity to construct immunity-based operators; (2) How to use the mechanisms of virus attacking cells to construct virus transmission operators; (3) How to use the mechanisms of infectious disease treatment to construct infectious disease treatment operators; (4) How to implant independent virus description factor into features of an individual; (5) How to embed various kinds of viruses in SEIQRA; (6) How to bring more different types of individuals into SEIQRA; 19 . A comparison of the convergence rate between \"REINIT is not invoked\" and \"REINIT is invoked\" when SEIQRA solves basic benchmark function F3.\n\n(7) How to reflect time-delay differences of outbreak of different viruses in SEIQRA.\n\nIn nature, there are millions of infectious diseases with different transmission mechanisms, infection mechanisms, immunity mechanisms and medical treatment methods, each infectious disease can be transformed into a population-based optimization algorithm with different performance. Besides these, the epidemic dynamics and the virus dynamics, which are built on mathematical models, provide solid mathematical foundations for developing artificial infectious disease optimization algorithms. Therefore, artificial infectious disease optimization may be form a new idea to carry out function optimization, which has rich connotations and magnanimous natural materials.\n\n(1) Initialize the following parameters: (a) Let t\u00bc0, initialize the parameters SEIQRA involves as specified in Table 3 "}
