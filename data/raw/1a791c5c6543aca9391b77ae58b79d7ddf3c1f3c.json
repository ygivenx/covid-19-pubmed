They are present at high levels on cell membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids, as well as on secreted glycoproteins and mucus at all mucosal surfaces (Fig. 1A ) (1, 2) . Sia are key mediators of many normal cell and tissue functions through a wide variety of highly regulated cell-cell interactions during both development and 60 homeostatic processes, where they may be bound by cellular receptors and members of the selectin family (3, 4) . Their ubiquitous presence on cells, tissues, and mucosal surfaces also make Sia a key point of contact for commensal microbes and for invading pathogens including viruses, bacteria, and parasites (3, 5, 6).\n\nSia are a highly diverse family of molecules that may be present as more than 50 of combinations of Sia forms including Neu4,5Ac 2 , Neu5,9Ac 2 , Neu5,7,9Ac 3 Sia, as well as their N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) analogs with the same O-acetyl modifications (Fig. 1B) .\n\nNeu5Gc is produced from Neu5Ac by the activity of cytidine 5'-monophosphate-N-80 All rights reserved.

The addition of O-Ac to the C7 and/or C9 positions is mediated by the sialylate O-acetyltransferase enzyme, Cas1 domain containing 1 (CasD1), which has been suggested to add an O-acetyl group to the C7 position, from which it would migrate to the C8 and C9 position under physiological conditions, allowing the possibility 85 of the addition of another O-acetyl group to C7 (7, 13, 14) . The regulatory processes that control the number or positions of acetyl groups have not been well defined, although distinct differences in expression of 7,9-O-Ac and 9-O-Ac Sia have been reported in mouse and human tissues, chicken embryos, and in some other animals (7) . CasD1 uses acetyl-CoA to modify Sia in the activated CMP-Sia form before it is added to the glycan chain, and likely has a preference 90 for CMP-Neu5Ac as a substrate and is less active on CMP-Neu5Gc (14). The sialate Oacetylesterase (SIAE) enzyme can remove the 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac modifications, although its activities and roles are not well understood (17) (18) (19) (20) . The 4-O-Ac Sia is produced in some tissues of many animals by a distinct sialate 4-O-acetyltransferase that is also likely expressed in the Golgi compartment; however, the gene for this enzyme has also not yet been identified 95 (21) (22) (23) . The 7, 8 , and/or 9-O-Ac Sia appear to be present at low levels -a few percent or less -in the cell-associated Sia on many cultured cells, but may be present at higher levels (10 to 50%) in Sia on the secreted mucus of various animals and on erythrocyte-associated glycans (15, 24) . However, the expression, distribution, and regulations of these modified Sia are not well 6 pathogens (26, 27) . Many pathogens therefore express proteins that attach to Sia, as well as expressing receptor-modifying enzymes such as sialidases (neuraminidases) that remove the Sia from the underlying glycan. Bacterial adhesins and toxins may recognize Sia on the surface of cells, and many bacteria can also use Sia as a metabolic carbon source after release through 110 the activity of neuraminidases, and uptake into the cell by Sia transporters (3, 28-31). These bacterial interactions with Sia are potentially affected by chemical modifications (30, 32) . Both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses may also bind Sia as primary receptors or co-receptors for cell recognition and infection, although only the enveloped viruses appear to express neuraminidases or sialate O-acetyl esterases, possibly to reduce aggregation of viral particles 115 during budding (5, 33) . For some viruses, Sia modifications are required for infection as viral proteins specifically bind to modified Sia -examples include human coronavirus OC43 and HKU1, and influenza C and D viruses, which all require 9-O-Ac Sia for cell infection (34, 35) .\n\nSignificant effects of different Sia modifications on the binding of pathogens or the activities of their sialidases (neuraminidases) have been suggested, but in general these are still 120 not well understood. Influenza A viruses (IAV) use Sia as primary receptors for host recognition and cell entry through the activity of two surface glycoproteins that interact with Sia, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). HA is a trimeric protein that binds Sia to initiate the endocytic uptake of the virus by the cell, leading to fusion between the viral envelope and the endosomal membrane after exposure of the virus to low pH (36) . NA is a sialidase which 125 cleaves Sia from the mucus, cell surface, and from viral glycoproteins, allowing the virus to penetrate through mucus to the epithelial cells and reducing the aggregation of virions after budding from the surface of cells (37). Previous studies have suggested that 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac Sia are expressed on cells or in tissues of many IAV host species and there is some evidence that these modifications may be inhibitory for NA activity and HA binding (38, 39) . However, the 130 specific effects of 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac on the binding of Sia by HA or the cleavage of Sia by IAV NA have not been examined in detail, and it is unclear whether these changes influence All rights reserved.

The difference between Neu5Gc and Neu5Ac has been found to influence the tropism of several different viruses, as well as some bacterial toxins (3, 5). Indeed, it has been proposed that the loss of the CMAH gene in humans was an adaptive response to pathogen pressures (40). Neu5Gc is highly expressed in some tissues of IAV natural host species, including pigs 140 and horses, and is also present in the tissues of mice and guinea pigs, which are frequently used as animals models (9, 12, 41) . Neu5Gc has been seen to prevent binding of the HAs of some IAV, particularly in human-adapted strains (39, 42) , but the effects on NA have not been well characterized. Nevertheless, examination of swine IAV isolates found distinct strain differences in their ability to cleave Neu5Gc by sialidase activity which were generally lower 145 than against Neu5Ac (43) .\n\nHere we define the expression of 7,9-O-Ac, 9-O-Ac, and Neu5Gc modified Sia in the mucus, saliva, and on erythrocytes of different IAV host animals, as well as on the tissues and secreted mucus of mice. We also test the effects of these modifications on HA binding and NA activity of different strains of IAV, as well as their potential to alter virus infection.

These modified Sia were also found throughout the GI tract, with staining associated with 160 epithelial cells, goblet cells, and associated mucus layers of the gastrointestinal tissues, including the stomach, small intestine, and colon (Fig. 2B) . Interestingly, 9-O-Ac appeared to be present in higher amounts in most tissues, including salivary gland and esophagus, while the 7,9-O-Ac staining was minimal. However, 7,9-O-Ac did stain stronger than 9-O-Ac in stomachassociated mucus, and on tracheal epithelial cells. This seems to indicate that while the same Table 1) , while, as expected, the CMAH -/mice showed only Neu5Ac in all tissues, similar to amounts reported previously for some of those tissues (44) (Supplemental Table 2 ). The lack of Neu5Gc in CMAH -/mice was also seen in GI tissues, indicating that Neu5Gc from dietary sources was not 180 detectably being taken up by these mice, as is seen in humans who eat a diet containing that Neu5Gc (46) . In the WT mice, tissues showed a great deal of variability in Neu5Gc expression.\n\nMost tissues had around 50-60% Neu5Gc; however, some tissues, including the liver, had higher levels of over 70%, while the brain and salivary glands had only 10%.

There was about 1.5 to 3 fold higher levels of O-acetyl Sia in most tissues of the CMAH knock-out mice ( Fig. 3C; Supplemental Table 2 ), as has been reported previously (44). The levels of 4-O-Ac Sia were generally low, making up ~2% of the Sia in small intestine (duodenum) and ~1% in spleen, testes, and esophagus. Mouse colon samples showed the highest levels of total O-acetylation, 190 with ~17% of Sia having one or more O-acetyl modification, again primarily 9-O-Ac. Given the patterns seen using the HE-Fc virolectin staining, the 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac forms must be present at high levels within or on certain cell sub-populations, as well as within mucus or mucussecreting cells. For example, the high levels of 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac found in the mouse colon were most likely associated with secreted mucus as most of those modified Sia were present in 195 goblet cells (Fig. 2B) . However, the differences seen between probe binding and the ratios of the different modified Sia within the total Sia underscore the importance of quantifying the different forms.\n\nAnalysis of modified Sia in saliva, mucus, and on erythrocytes. It has been previously reported that human colonic mucin is highly enriched in 9-O-Ac Sia, which may 200 regulate the activity of some sialidases and Sia transporters of the gut microflora (11, 32, 47, 48) . Strong staining for 9-O-Ac in human respiratory tissues, and also within the submucosal glands of human respiratory tissue have also been reported, indicating that mucus from these glands could be enriched in O-acetylated Sia (47, 48) . To determine if human respiratory mucus was enriched in 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac, secreted mucus from primary normal human bronchial 205 epithelial cells (NHBE) as well as conditioned media from human alveolar basal epithelial adenocarcinoma A549 cells, were analyzed by HPLC to determine Sia composition. We found that the secreted proteins in mucus from NHBE cells and A549 cells conditioned media contained primarily unmodified Neu5Ac with ~1-2% of 9-O-Ac and no detectable levels of 7,9-O-Ac (Table 1) . This indicates that secreted mucus from these respiratory cells in culture are 210 All rights reserved.

While the proteins in saliva differ from those found in 215 respiratory mucus, they do contain some of the same heavily glycosylated proteins including mucins like MUC5B (49) (50) (51) . Human saliva was similar to the secreted mucus from NHBE and Erythrocytes (red blood cells, RBCs) express high levels of sialylated surface molecules, primarily on glycophorins, and are used in IAV research to study the interactions of HA binding specificity, determining viral titer through the hemagglutination assay, and inhibition of hemagglutination by antibodies (HAI assay) (52, 53). It has long been known that IAV varies in 230 hemagglutination of RBCs from different species, at least in part due to differences in the Sia linkages present. The structures of HAs with Sia bound often suggest that modification of the C4, 5, 7, and/or 9 positions would influence IAV interactions with Sia. We found that chicken and guinea pig RBCs, which are often used to titer IAV virus and as the standard substrate for HAI assays, contained almost exclusively unmodified Neu5Ac, as did those from humans and 235 dogs (Fig. 4C,D) . In contrast, pig, horse, cow, and sheep RBCs contain high proportions of All rights reserved.

The high levels of Neu5Gc Sia present on the RBCs of these species had been previously reported, although not directly quantified as presented here (24, 54 ). The mouse erythrocytes tested here (from C57BL/6 mice) had the greatest diversity of modifications, with little Neu5Gc, around 50% Neu5Ac, and ~50% 240 of the Sia modified by 7, 8 and/or 9-O-acetylation, as previously reported (55) . \n\nThese NA VLPs were first tested for enzymatic activity using a standard NA cleavage assay using methylumbelliferyl N-acetylneuraminide (MuNANA) as the substrate (Fig. 5C) (42) . The NA-expressing VLPs were incubated with BSM or with RBCs, and the released Sia were collected and analyzed by HPLC. For BSM, HPLC profiles of total Sia were created to compare NA cleavage preferences (Fig. 6A) . These profiles showed the Sia forms that were susceptible 255 to NA cleavage and release while the non-released forms were considered to be resistant to NA. These HPLC profiles were then compared to the total Sia released chemically by acid hydrolysis, an unbiased method that removes all Sia forms present in the original sample (45) .\n\nAll of the viral NA and the bacterial NeuA showed the highest level of cleavage for unmodified Neu5Ac compared to any of the modified forms, as more Neu5Ac was present in the released 260 profiles compared to chemical release. There was substantial variation in the cleavage activity against the modified Sia by the different viral NAs. N1 and N7 showed the lowest activities All rights reserved.

To further test the ability of these NA VLPs to cleave Neu5Gc compared to Neu5Ac, the 270 amounts of Sia released from either horse RBCs (84% Neu5Gc) or chicken RBCs (99% Neu5Ac) were compared. All NAs showed significantly lower levels of Neu5Gc Sia released from horse RBCs compared to the amounts of Neu5Ac released from chicken RBCs (Fig. 6B) .\n\nWhen compared directly, NA VLPs removed 5-12% of Neu5Gc compared to their activities on Neu5Ac (Fig. 6C) . Again, variability was seen between NA VLPs here, with N7 having the 275 lowest activity against Neu5Gc compared to Neu5Ac and N9 having the most. There was also variability in cleavage activity between NA from different strains as well, as seen in the variable amount of Neu5Ac removed by the NA VLPs in Figure 6B , but it is unclear whether this difference is due to the intrinsic activates of the NAs when expressed as VLPs or to innate differences in the specific activities of each NA enzyme, or both. It is clear, however, that O-280 acetyl and Neu5Gc modifications inhibit the activities of many different IAV NA and of NeuA, and that multiple modifications, such as di-O-acetyl modifications, or Neu5Gc that is also Oacetylated, were even more inhibitory, showing high resistance to most of the viral and bacterial NAs tested here.\n\n285 glycoprotein binding to Sia to allow the virus to be taken up into the cell, and there appears to be a direct relationship between Sia binding affinity and infection (59) .

Neu5Ac9NAc was used instead of 9-O-acetyl Neu5Ac 290 (Neu5,9Ac 2 ) due to the increased stability of the 9-N-Ac group (61, 62 Aichi/1968 H3 HA-Fcs had decreased binding to Neu5Gc and Neu5Ac9NAc (Fig. 7A) . The addition of the N-acetyl group at C9 blocked most binding, while Neu5Gc showed only a low level of binding. We saw the same binding dynamics for other H1 and H3 HA-Fc, but the SNA lectin, which recognizes \u03b12-6-linked Sia, bound equally well to Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc, but not to Neu5Ac9NAc (Fig. 7B) . This shows that the presence of O-(and in this case N-) acetyl 300 modifications can inhibit many Sia-binding proteins.

To specifically compare the effects of added Neu5Gc or Neu5Ac on the efficiency of 315 infection, the same three IAV strains were incubated with mouse serum from either wild-type mice (>80% Neu5Gc) or CMAH -/mice (100% Neu5Ac) prior to inoculation of cells (Fig. 8B) . In this case no specific trend was detected for the three viruses tested. Victoria H3N2 showed almost complete inhibition of infection by both sera, while PR8 H1N1 had a lower level of inhibition. Only pH1N1 showed a significant difference in response to the serums, with the WT 320 mouse serum having a much stronger inhibitory effect compared to the CMAH -/serum. This suggests that Neu5Gc vs. Neu5Ac inhibition may vary by virus strain, and that likely depends on some combination of HA binding specificity and NA activity.

The percentages of O-acetyl modified Sia in the tissues of mice varied widely, with high levels of 7,9-O-Ac 2 and 9-O-Ac being found on erythrocytes (~47%) and the colon (~19%). The levels in most other tissues varied between 2 and 9%, although these would likely be associated with higher levels on the smaller subsets of cells that were positive for staining with the probes. Neu5Gc was also present in many wild-type mouse 345 tissues with expression varying widely (between 10 and 80%). This is consistent with staining for Neu5Gc previously reported in some mouse tissues (44). 4-O-Ac Sia was found in small quantities in only a few tissues, with the highest being found in small intestine (~2%). This is consistent with previous findings of 4-O-Ac levels in mouse brain and liver quantified by GC/MS, although gut associated levels of 4-O-Ac were much higher in that study, possibly due to has not yet been identified, little is known about its synthesis, expression, or regulation (22, 23).\n\nAll rights reserved.

However, human saliva and secreted mucus from respiratory cells contained mostly unmodified Neu5Ac, suggesting different expression of modified Sia in the mucus of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tissues. This may be due to the particular functional characteristics of the microbiome in the GI tract compared to other mucosal sites, where 7,9-O-370 and 9-O-Ac on colonic mucus may decrease bacterial degradation of sialylated glycans, perhaps improving mucus integrity (69, 70) . Microbiome interactions may also explain the increased O-acetyl modifications found on both cow and mouse saliva. Cows are ruminants and as part of their digestion, regurgitate partially digested food from their microbe-rich rumen into their mouth to continue chewing as a cud to extract more nutrients. Somewhat similarly, mice 375 are coprophagic and consume feces, along with associated microbes, to re-digest again to improve absorption of nutrients. This would give both cows and mice the potential for more complex mucus and microbe interactions in both the oral cavity and the gut, thus having Oacetyl modifications on sialylated glycans on saliva mucus proteins could be advantageous by preventing degradation. However, further research is needed on the roles of these modifications 380 for the interactions between oral and colonic mucus with the microbiome.\n\nhost infection, and the specific linkages of Sia to the underlying glycan chain have long been known to influence host tropism (36) . We examined the effects of O-acetyl and Neu5Gc modifications on IAV HA binding, NA cleavage, and on infection, and found differences among 385 the IAV strains examined. All the different IAV NA tested showed preferential removal of Neu5Ac over any modified Sia form. Cleavage by N1, N7, and N9 were strongly inhibited by mono-acetylated Sia, while N2 and N3 were less affected. All NA had much lower activity against Neu5Gc, di-acetylated Sia, and particularly against Neu5Gc forms with additional Oacetylations. This confirms previous reports showing or suggesting inhibition of NA cleavage in 390 H1N1 and H3N2 strains (38, 42) , but revealing that there is wide variation of effects on different All rights reserved.

Acetylation and Neu5Gc modifications were also inhibitory for HA binding, with soluble HA-Fc sourced from different H1N1 and H3N2 IAV strains showing significantly lower binding to these forms compared to unmodified Neu5Ac in an ELLA assay. (59, 71) , and is seen in the balance between the activities of the HA and NA for the \u03b12-3 and \u03b12-6-linked Sia (71, 72) . Incubation of virus with the wild-type mouse serum 405 (>80% Neu5Gc) compared to the serum of CMAH -/mice (100% Neu5Ac) also showed varying effects. Inhibition by WT serum was seen only for pH1N1 virus, while Victoria H3N2 and PR8 H1N1 were inhibited by both sera. This could confirm previous findings that the density of Sia on these serum proteins is the strongest inhibitory factor rather than the type of modified Sia present, as shown for incubation with horse serum (73). However, the variable results for 410 different viruses may indicate variation in sensitivity to Neu5Gc between strains that requires further investigation. It would also be worthwhile comparing inhibition of IAV strains adapted to different host species, particularly species with higher levels of modified Sia present in their respiratory tracts such as horses and pigs.\n\nIn summary we have shown that both the O-acetyl and Neu5Gc modifications present on 415 secreted glycoproteins in mucus and saliva, as well as on erythrocytes, vary greatly between different species.
