{"title": "Trends in the Mechanistic and Dynamic Modeling of Infectious Diseases", "body": "Recent work in infectious disease dynamics has been characterized by an increasing focus on data and principled approaches to inference. Traditionally, deterministic models were a dominant tool for studying the theoretical and practical basis of disease transmission in humans and animals. This approach yielded important practical and theoretical results that form the basis of our understanding of disease dynamics [3\u2022, 4] but was limited in approach. Deterministic models are usually parameterized through some combination of trajectory matching (i.e., minimizing the distance between observed and simulated data) and specifying parameters based on previous literature. This approach may be sufficient to describe the expected behavior of an infectious disease in a large population, but an increasing focus on how stochasticity and parameter uncertainty impact public health decision making, combined with the growing availability of computational power, has driven a move toward more statistically principled and data-driven likelihood-based approaches.\n\nIllustrative of this evolution is the contrast between early descriptions of the key dynamic properties of HIV transmission with more recent dynamic characterizations of pandemic H1N1 influenza (H1N1pdm), Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), and Ebola. In the late 1980s, several papers were published laying out the essential properties of HIV transmission dynamics that would govern the course of the epidemic (at least in the near term) [5\u20137]. These papers presented deterministic epidemic models that captured the processes driving the epidemic and highlighted the key parameters, such as the speed of progression to AIDS, that needed to be investigated. Uncertainty was largely addressed through scenario-based approaches (e.g., different future epidemic trajectories were presented for different plausible sets of parameters), and for the most part, different aspects of the transmission dynamics were derived from independent studies, with only the growth rate (i.e., doubling time) estimated from incidence data. While the parameters essential to characterizing epidemic dynamics remain largely unchanged for recently emerging pathogens, the approach to data and estimation is qualitatively different. Integrated statistical frameworks built on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques are used to estimate all, or most, parameters from different datasets and to produce posterior distributions both for parameter estimates and forecasts of future incidence [8, 9\u2022, 10]. These methods allow innovative use of unconventional data sources, such as disease incidence among travelers [8, 9\u2022], to estimate population incidence of the disease, and molecular data can supplement incidence data providing independent estimates of the same parameters (see discussion of phylodynamics below) [8, 9\u2022].\n\nThese recent attempts to quickly characterize the properties of emerging diseases are emblematic of an increasing focus on developing statistical methods, grounded in dynamical models, to estimate key epidemic parameters based on diverse data sources. Surveillance data is often used to estimate the reproductive number (R\nt, the number of secondary infections that a primary infection is expected to infect at any point, t, in an epidemic), incubation period, and serial interval (the expected time between symptom onset in a case and the people that case infects), as was done in recent outbreaks of MERS-CoV [9\u2022, 11] and Ebola [10]. Surveillance data has also been paired with serological data to estimate force of infection (i.e., the hazard of infection) and basic reproductive number (R\nt, when the population is fully susceptible, designated R\n0) of several pathogens, including dengue and chikungunya [12\u201314].\n\nDynamic modeling approaches can also aid in the interpretation of surveillance data. State-space models (e.g., hidden Markov models) have been used to pair our mechanistic understanding of disease transmission with a statistical inference framework by linking observed incidence and dynamics with underlying population disease burden and susceptibility (i.e., the population\u2019s state). Notably, this approach has been used to estimate global reductions in mortality due to measles in the face of incomplete reporting [15\u2022]. Likewise, Valle and colleagues used hybrid associative and mechanistic models to account for biases that treatment of detected malaria cases might have on estimates of key values such as the incidence rate [16].\n\nPerhaps, the biggest limitation when attempting to characterize the parameters driving disease transmission remains data availability. Data on disease transmission often comes from incomplete surveillance data or represents one aspect of a partially observed epidemic process. For example, epidemic curves are usually limited to symptomatic cases. Similarly, key events in the transmission process, such as the exact time of infection, are generally not observable and have to be inferred from observed data. Methods, such as the use of MCMC-based data augmentation and known transmission processes to infer the possible distribution of transmission trees, have been developed to deal with partially observed data and have been used to reconstruct outbreaks [17], characterize risk factors for transmission [18], and quantify the impact of interventions [19].\n\nA limitation of likelihood-based approaches, such as those mentioned above, is that it is often impossible or impractical to evaluate the data likelihood, in particular, for complex models and large datasets. To deal with this challenge, several \u201clikelihood-free approaches\u201d have been developed, including approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) [20, 21]. An advantage of these approaches is that they only require the ability to simulate from candidate models (i.e., if data can be simulated, calculation of the likelihood is unnecessary) and therefore can be more easily applied than methods that require iterative evaluation of the likelihood. ABC has been used to integrate phylodynamic and epidemic models of influenza and other pathogens [22], and SMC methods have been used to parametrize dengue transmission models using data from multi-centric vaccine clinical trials [23\u2022].\n\nDespite important advances over the past decades in linking data and transmission models as tools of inference, many challenges remain and are the topic of continued research. Inference for complex models and using large datasets remain challenging, in part, due to computational burden. Mechanistic models offer promise as a way to simultaneously link data from diverse, heterogenous data sources (as in [24]), but this promise has yet to be realized, though some phylodynamics methods come close (see below). Further, rapid inference on emergent epidemics remains a tool only used in high-profile epidemics [9\u2022, 10], and these inferential techniques remain inaccessible to field epidemiologists.\n\nScientists and physicians have tried to forecast the course of epidemics since the time of Hippocrates. Associations between incidence and extrinsic factors such as time of year, climate, and weather can and have been used to forecast infectious diseases [25\u201327]. However, mechanistic models that capture the natural history of the disease (e.g., duration of immunity and cross protection) [28], mode of transmission [29], and movement patterns [30, 31] can improve forecasts, particularly when associations with extrinsic drivers of incidence, such as climate, are weak or unknown (e.g., for emerging pathogens).\n\nIn recent years, forecasts based on models that capture the underlying mechanistic processes of transmission and pathogenesis have become common. Uses range from forecasting the peak timing and magnitude of an influenza season [32], to forecasting the spread and spatial extent of emerging pathogens such as Zika, Ebola, and chikungunya [33\u201335]. The mechanistic underpinning of these models allows forecasts to take into account dynamic processes that may, otherwise, be impossible to capture, including changes in behavior and resource availability in response to an epidemic [36].\n\nApproaches adopted from computer science, machine learning, and climate science have enhanced our ability to provide reliable forecasts with quantified uncertainty. Particularly important are ensemble approaches [37], which integrate forecasts from multiple imperfect models or different parameterizations of the same model to calculate a distribution of potential courses of the epidemic [38, 39]. Ensemble approaches have been used for forecasting influenza in temperate regions [40], where influenza is highly seasonal, and more recently in subtropical areas such as Hong Kong, where the seasonal pattern is less distinct [32]. Similarly, ensemble-based climate models have been incorporated with infectious disease models to forecast climate-related disease including plague and malaria [41]. These examples use multiple parameterizations of a single model. Ensemble approaches can also be used to accommodate uncertainty in model structure by comparing estimates from parameterizations across different models, as is work by Smith and colleagues where an ensemble of 14 different individual-based models was used to estimate the impact of a future malaria vaccine [42].\n\nThere has been an explosion in the number of forecasts being made to aid public health decision making, including a number of government-sponsored contests to forecast the progression epidemics of diseases ranging from influenza to chikungunya and dengue [43\u201345]. As forecasts become more widely used, care must be given to ensure that the purposes of the model and uncertainty (both structural and statistical) are well communicated. In a recent outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, like Ebola, groups raced to make forecasts of the evolution and spatial spread of the outbreak [33, 34], with some predicting an epidemic size orders of magnitude greater than what was actually observed. While some of these extreme forecasts were made as worst-case planning scenarios, they were interpreted as likely scenarios, raising alarm and casting doubt on the validity of model-based forecasts, thus highlighting the importance of clear communication of a model\u2019s purpose and its limitations [33, 46].\n\nThe quality of infectious disease forecasts and standards for their interpretation are far from the gold standard of methods and conventions used in the meteorology. Improvement in both the methods used and their practical use remain critical areas of future research.\n\nThe advent of \u201cbig data\u201d has opened up new avenues in how we parameterize and understand models of infectious disease spread. Big data refers to massive datasets that are too large or complex to be processed using conventional approaches [47]. However, advances in computing increasingly allow their use without large delays in processing time or unrealistic computing capacity requirements.\n\nOne of the most successful attempts to use big data to understand disease dynamics has been the use of call data records (CDRs) to capture human mobility. For each call that is made or received, mobile phone operators capture the mobile phone tower through which the call is made. By tracking tower locations for a subscriber, we can capture where he or she is moving. In practice, to ensure confidentiality, CDRs are usually averaged over millions of subscribers to provide estimates of flux between different locations in a country. Transmission models built upon CDR-based estimates of seasonal patterns of human movement have been used to explain patterns of rubella disease in Kenya [48] and dengue in Pakistan [31]. In both instances, models built on empirical human movements seen in CDRs outperformed alternative parametric models of population movement based on our theoretical understanding of human travel patterns (e.g., gravity models where movement is based on community size and distance [49]) and models where movement was not considered. CDR-based models have also been used to understand the dynamics of large-scale outbreaks such as Ebola in West Africa [50] and challenges in malaria elimination [51]. Questions remain as to the generalizability of CDR-based analyses in settings where mobile phone ownership is low [52], and problems capturing flows between countries remain. However, the large-scale penetration of mobile phones, even in resource-poor settings, makes CDRs a hugely valuable data source for informing infectious disease models.\n\nAnother type of big data that has enormous potential for furthering our understanding of disease dynamics is satellite imagery. Detailed satellite imagery can provide high-spatial-resolution estimates of key determinants of many infectious disease processes, including environmental factors (e.g., land cover), climatic conditions (e.g., precipitation, temperature), and population density throughout the globe [53, 54]. In infectious disease epidemiology, such datasets have recently been used as the basis for statistical models that produce fine scale maps of disease incidence, prevalence, and derived transmission parameters (e.g., force of infection, basic reproductive number) for a large number of diseases. Early efforts focused on mapping the global distribution of key drivers of malaria transmission [55, 56]. These approaches have since been used to estimate the burden from a wide range of pathogens [57\u201360], vectors [61], and host reservoirs [62]. These analyses have allowed disease burden and risk to be estimated in areas with limited surveillance capabilities, expanding our understanding of the global burden of many pathogens. High-resolution geographic data can gain additional power when paired with mechanistic models that capture changes in disease risk, as in recent analyses that accounted for the effect of birth, natural infection, and vaccine disruptions driving increases in measles susceptibility and epidemic risk in the wake of the Ebola outbreak [63].\n\nFinally, big data are increasingly being used with mechanistic models to more directly estimate disease burden in real time [64]. For example, patterns in the usage of different Google search terms have been shown to correlate well with incidence trends for diseases such as influenza [65, 66] and dengue [67]. It is worth noting that big data alone can typically only explain part of trends in incidence, and models that incorporate seasonal dynamics typically outperform models that rely solely on search terms. Similar approaches have been used with Wikipedia updates [68] and social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook. Electronic medication sales data and electronic medical records have also been proposed as novel data sources of disease trends [69]. These approaches can provide estimates much faster than traditional surveillance systems, where it often takes weeks or months for results of cases to be aggregated and analyzed. Mechanistic models can then be fit to this data to better understand seasonal or spatial parameters. For example, Yang et al. used mechanistic models fit to Google Flu Trend data to estimate epidemiological parameters such as the basic reproductive number and the attack rate for 115 cities in the USA over a 10-year period [69, 70].\n\nPhylodynamics, the study of how epidemiological, immunological, and evolutionary processes interact to shape pathogen genealogies, is among the newest and fastest-growing areas in infectious disease research [71]. The term phylodynamics was coined in 2004 by Grenfell et al., who observed that the structure of pathogen phylogenies reveals important features of epidemic dynamics in populations and within hosts [72]. This relationship provides a theoretical framework for linking molecular data with population-level disease patterns using dynamic models.\n\nEarly methodological work in phylodynamics concentrated on the formal integration of the Kingman\u2019s coalescent and birth death models from population genetics with standard deterministic epidemic models. The coalescent model provides a framework for estimating the probability of coalescent events (lineages converging at a common ancestor) as we move back in time given changes in population size [73]. The branching patterns in a phylogenetic tree describe the ancestral history of sequenced pathogens, such that nodes closer to the root of the tree represent historical coalescent events while nodes near the tip represent recent events. The strong relationship between the genetic divergence of pathogens and time allows us to estimate the timing of coalescent events and estimate the rate of growth (or decline) of pathogen populations. These estimates are the critical link between genetic and epidemic models [74].\n\nThe formal statistical integration of population genetic and epidemic models allows us to estimate the critical epidemiological parameters such as the basic reproductive number directly from pathogen sequence data [75\u201377]. For example, Magiorkinis et al. used sequence data from viruses collected over a 12-year period in Greece to estimate subtype-specific reproductive numbers and generation times for hepatitis C [77]. Using data from the ATHENA HIV cohort, which samples \u223c60 % of HIV-infected persons in the Netherlands, Bezemer et al. used viral sequence data to estimate reproductive numbers for hundreds of circulating transmission chains, showing that large chains persisted within the Netherlands for years near the threshold for sustaining an epidemic (R = 1) [77, 78].\n\nOther phylodynamic applications have focused on elucidating the spatial dispersal pattern diseases such as influenza and HIV. In an analysis of nearly 10,000 influenza genomes, Bedford et al. showed fundamental differences in the global circulation patterns of H3N2, H1N1, and influenza B viruses and that these were potentially driven by differences in the force of infection and rates of immune escape (i.e., antigenic drift) [79]. Likewise, Faria et al. used HIV sequence data from central Africa to reconstruct the early epidemic dynamics of HIV-1 using phylodynamic methods and showed that Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo likely served as the focal point for global HIV spread [79, 80].\n\nPhylodynamics plays an important role in real-time infectious disease surveillance and targeted control [81]. In recent epidemics of MERS-CoV and Ebola, genomic data was used to assess transmission patterns, monitor viral evolution in populations, and inform epidemic control [9\u2022, 82\u201384]. Analyses of HIV epidemics among US and European men who have sex with men demonstrate that the amalgamation of epidemiologic and genomic data can be used to identify high-risk transmitters and optimal targeted intervention packages [85\u2022, 86]. However, the utility of real-time phylodynamic analysis in many settings remains hindered by inadequate infrastructure, few viral sequence data, and limited analytic capacity at local levels.\n\nInitial phylodynamic models could only deal with simple epidemic patterns (e.g., exponential growth), and recent methodological work has focused on extending the phylodynamic framework to account for complex nonlinear population dynamics [87, 88]. For instance, Rasmussen and colleagues showed how phylodynamic models could be extended to integrate more complex stochastic and structured epidemic models using Bayesian MCMC and particle filtering [89\u2022]. Others have focused on resolving transmission network structure from phylogenies [90, 91] or integrating data across multiple scales by incorporating information on intra-host pathogen diversity and ecological processes directly into phylodynamic models [92]. However, equally important recent work has shown that phylodynamic inferences can be highly sensitive to sampling and unmeasured factors. Simulation studies show that the relationship between phylogenetic trees and the underlying transmission networks is a complex function of the sampling fraction and underlying epidemic dynamics [93, 94] and that failure to account for intra-host viral diversity may bias phylodynamic inference [95].\n\nHere, we have focused on areas where we feel that there has been the most innovation in the use of dynamic epidemic models in recent years. This is not to imply that innovation has stopped in other areas where dynamic models play a key role. Dynamic models have long been key to our understanding of epidemic theory. Innovative models continue to be developed to deal with the challenges posed by pathogen evolution [96], complex immunological interactions [97], and host heterogeneity [98]. There has been increasing emphasis on the use of dynamic models in informing public health policy since the early 2000s when they played a key role in the response to the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in the UK [99] and assessment of the risk from a smallpox-based bioterrorist attack [100, 101]. These uses have extended to endemic disease, such as a 2009 modeling analysis by Granich and colleagues [102] that highlighted the potential of \u201ctest-and-treat\u201d strategies for HIV control. Recently, dynamic models have played an important role in guiding the response to emerging disease threats, from pandemic influenza [103], to multi-drug resistant organisms [104, 105] to MERS-CoV [106]. Many of the themes discussed throughout this manuscript have had a profound impact on these efforts, as does the need to report results and assumptions in a way accessible to policy makers.\n\nMechanistic models also crop up in other areas of epidemiology, often in less obvious ways. Nearly all of the key methods of genetic epidemiology are based on a mechanistic understanding of the underlying processes inheritance, mutation, and selective pressure. Social epidemiology at its core is based on the idea that our health depends on the behavior and health of those around us and, hence, has its own approaches to dependent happenings (though the terminology differs). Recently, there has been increasing interest in using mechanistic modeling approaches similar to those used for infectious disease to understand health phenomena that are, in part, socially driven, such as obesity [107]. Physiological measurements are often founded on mechanistic models of processes within the body (e.g., use of serum creatinine to approximate the glomerular filtration rate, a key measure of kidney function [108]).\n\nInfectious disease dynamics is, perhaps, unique in epidemiology in the number of researchers that it brings from non-health related disciplines, particularly physics, computer science, and ecology. This, combined with the unique aspects of infectious disease systems, has contributed to the use of models that are distinct from \u201ctraditional\u201d epidemiologic methods. However, the field is being transformed by the same forces that are transforming epidemiology in general: increasing access to technological tools and computational power; an explosion in the availability of data at the molecular, individual, and population levels; and a shift in what the important epidemiologic questions are as we eliminate old health threats and change our environment. Increasing emphasis on principled statistical analysis in infectious disease modeling combined with an increasing need to deal with dynamic phenomena in epidemiologic inference opens up new opportunities for the cross pollination of ideas and the erosion of the historical barriers between epidemiologic fields."}
