{"title": "Journal Pre-proof COVID-19 in Endoscopy: Time to do more? Title: COVID-19 in Endoscopy: Time to do more?", "body": "COVID-19 in endoscopy: Time to do more?\n\nWe have read with great interest the paired articles on SARS-CoV-2/Novel Coronavirus-19 in this issue of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. The first is entitled \"Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak: what the department of endoscopy should know\" by Repici et al, 1 which describes the Italian experience, and the second is \"Considerations in performing endoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic\" by Soetikno et al, 2 which is drawn largely from the Hong Kong experience. We would like to congratulate the authors for their development and rigorous account of the endoscopic practices they have successfully used to minimize infection of endoscopy staff while providing essential services in this high-risk environment. We would also like to share a U.S. hospital perspective gained from our experience contending with numerous COVID-19 cases following the Biogen conference in Boston, Massachusetts. A COVID-19 standard operating procedure for endoscopy is included in Figure 1 .\n\nThese two articles have several similarities and also cover unique aspects regarding the management of COVID-19 in the endoscopy unit. The need for clear communication across the entire endoscopy team, and anesthesia if involved, was emphasized. We also believe a daily huddle with endoscopy leadership is critical to review policies and discuss issues so that all groups are represented in the decision-making process and can deliver the most comprehensive, accurate updates to their staff in this incredibly fluid time when guidelines may change seemingly hour by hour. Creating a step-by-step approach to suspected or COVID-positive patients from the time they enter the endoscopy unit to the time they leave and ensuring everyone on the team is on the same page was also addressed. Once the team has created this detailed workflow with clear delineation of who is responsible for each step, and who to call for any necessary equipment that may not be readily available in the endoscopy unit such as powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs), mock drills should be conducted with the teams.\n\nThe articles also nicely address the mandate to minimize nonurgent procedures in an effort to limit the spread of infection from asymptomatic patients and providers and to conserve precious personal protective equipment (PPE), hospital beds, and other important resources. We have classified nonurgent procedures into nonurgent/perform and nonurgent/postpone. Examples of nonurgent cases that may be performed include cancer staging and prosthetic removal. All screening and most surveillance procedures should be delayed. Many diagnostic procedures, including evaluation of chronic GERD, abdominal pain, and diarrhea may be postponed as well. Leveraging information technologies can be helpful in these nonstandard workflows. We created custom-built reports for providers within the electronic health record (EHR) to facilitate triaging and rescheduling patients. The procedure list is reviewed and categorized by a nonphysician healthcare provider, with final review by a physician. The postponed cases are further classified into how long they can wait (1 month, 2 months, 3 months, etc), and by which providers can perform the case. Some cases involving complex situations may need multidisciplinary input and as well as discussion with the patient before making a final decision. As a result, we have cut our daily endoscopy volume by over 80% and closed our ambulatory endoscopy practice.\n\nFor patients who have their elective procedures deferred, a virtual visit in the interim may be helpful in their GI management until their procedure can be safely performed. As part of the State of Emergency response in Massachusetts, telemedicine and virtual visit restrictions have greatly relaxed to promote usage across state lines and include new patient visits. Additionally, these types of visits are now reimbursed at the same rate as in-person visits. At present, telemedicine or virtual visits make up 91% of our upcoming clinic appointments.\n\nPrescreening and categorization of patient risk is emphasized in these articles to identify those who may need COVID-19 testing before endoscopy and special isolation precautions. This includes asking about fever, respiratory symptoms, sick contacts, and travel to high-risk areas, although the latter is increasingly moot with the spread of the pandemic. As nearly 50% of infected patients report gastrointestinal symptoms including anorexia in over 80% and diarrhea in nearly 30% with 3% having only GI symptoms without respiratory issues, 3, 4 we have added these gastrointestinal symptoms to the list of prescreening questions with importance placed on duration of symptoms. All scheduled patients are called the day before by nurses for screening and the same questions are again asked the day of the procedure in addition to measuring their temperature. Our hospital created screening forms integrated into the EHR to facilitate standardized screening before procedures. Additionally, our health system reaches out to patients both via automated phone calls and our electronic patient portal advising them to contact their provider before their visit if they have any symptoms.\n\nThe importance of social or physical distancing as advocated recently by WHO throughout a patient's time in the endoscopy unit is stressed in the papers, with a 6-foot minimum between individuals. To help meet this requirement, we only allow 1 family member/chaperone per patient who waits in a centralized waiting area, and this visitor cannot enter the pre-or postprocedure areas. Soetikno et al suggested that suspected and COVID-19 positive patients should be given a mask and separated from other patients by at least 6 feet, or alternatively placed in a negative pressure room. We believe the latter should be emphasized with more stringent and immediate isolation precautions being instituted for all these patients, and procedures performed in airborne infection isolation rooms that adhere to Level 3 biosafety requirements. We also agree with the need for a separate toilet as part of the isolation to minimize spread of infection due to bioaerosols from the toilet plume. If these resources are not available in the endoscopy unit, the cases should be performed where the proper facilities are available. These cases should also be preferably performed at the end of the day with patients recovered in the procedure room, or back in their isolation unit.\n\nPhysical distancing by staff in the endoscopy unit is emphasized in Soetikno et al. 2 We feel this is important, especially in areas with community spread. Our hospital system has recently changed policy to mandate that all employees wear surgical masks at all times while in the hospital and attest to their wellness online before reporting to work.\n\nWe suggest labeling each computer so the same provider uses that computer and chair for the entire day, and separating by at least 6 feet. Because many procedure rooms may be empty, 1 provider per day can use these rooms as \"offices.\" We have converted to obtaining verbal consent by phone or in person (6 feet away) from patients and not having patients physically sign consent forms. Pens, clipboards, phones, and chairs should be not be shared. If unsure, these items should be cleaned before use and hand hygiene performed after use. Deep cleaning of the entire endoscopy unit is recommended nightly.\n\nBoth articles emphasize that all endoscopic procedures (upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, EUS, ERCP) are aerosol-generating, referencing studies that show contamination of the endoscopist's face during routine procedures. This makes all endoscopic procedures high risk from an infectious standpoint, and appropriate PPE is recommended. This is an important point. N95s are recommended for high-risk patients undergoing any endoscopic procedure with a standard surgical mask recommended for low risk patients. However, we believe there is a spectrum of risk-severity that is regional and temporal in nature. In a pandemic where asymptomatic transmission is known to occur, significant undertesting continues, and society is expected to practice extreme physical distancing with closure of all nonessential businesses, are there any truly low-risk patients? Remember that COVID-19 is thought to be at least 3 times as contagious as the flu virus, and the majority of cases are thought to occur by asymptomatic transmission. It makes little sense for healthcare providers to perform aerosolizing procedures, with patients coughing or passing gas on them, while not wearing an N95 mask or better.\n\nWe believe it is important to use full PPE for all endoscopic procedures while in a pandemic such as this especially in areas with community spread, because no one is truly low risk given our ongoing difficulties with testing. A study from China showed that no medical staff working in high-risk departments who wore N95s and practiced strict hand hygiene regardless of patient's infection status became infected 5 . Ideally, an N95 and face shield should be used with other standard PPE for all endoscopy cases, and PAPR for known COVID-19 positive cases if the case absolutely cannot be deferred. The suggestion to use PAPRs for COVID-19 positive patients is born from China's anecdotal experience during endoscopic endonasal procedures where infection spread was apparently not controlled with N95 and only possible after use of PAPRs. We fully appreciate that PPEs are currently in tight supply; however, with careful conservation the above may be possible. It starts with only doing procedures that are absolutely necessary. PPE use should be tightly regulated. Our hospital has gathered all masks and face shields and are having every provider sign one out each day as needed. Before this, we had a PPE station in the unit where the provider signed out masks using their ID, employee number, and patient medical record number. The mask can be reused as long as it is functional, not soiled, and not used in a suspected or COVIDpositive patient. It is important to cover the N95 to prevent soiling. We prefer a face shield for this purpose because surgical masks are also running low throughout the country. A guide to proper extended use and reuse is provided at the CDC. 6 Proper donning and doffing practices should also be followed. 7 It is important to remove the face shield and N95 after dirty gloves are removed without touching the front of the shield or mask (with careful hand washing following mask removal). The face shield should be cleaned with disinfectant wipes before storage. UV-C light can be effective at disinfecting masks and should be considered. Each PPE should be stored in its own paper bag labeled with the provider's name; therefore, one bag may be for N95 and another for the face shield. If the use of N95 with all high-risk procedures is not possible, COVID-19 testing to better risk stratify patients before all endoscopy cases may be considered as an alternative. Ultimately, testing all patients before high-risk procedures such as endoscopy is likely the best approach; however, this will depend on significant expansion of testing capabilities. Hopefully, the development of point-of-care testing with rapid results and increasing testing availability will make this a reality soon.\n\nAdditionally, we cannot have 2 levels of PPE used in our endoscopy cases, where anesthesiologists and nurse anesthetists wear N95s because joint society anesthesia guidelines state that they must wear full PPE for all aerosol-generating procedures, but the endoscopy team uses only surgical masks. 8 It may also be prudent to intubate all upper endoscopy procedures to decrease ongoing aerosolization during these procedures. We have stopped using all topical anesthetics to numb the throat as well.\n\nOther important principles include strategic assignment of available personnel. It is important to minimize concomitant exposure of providers with similar or unique skill sets. Nonphysician practitioners and fellows who cannot participate in cases may help screening and triaging patients, or perform virtual visits. We have stopped having fellows do procedures with certain exceptions in order to preserve PPE, minimize exposure, and reduce procedure times. We have been mindful about minimizing the number of providers in the endoscopy unit at one time and trying to keep the same endoscopist in the unit all day rather than rotating providers. In addition, providers who are at higher risk due to their age, comorbidities, or immune status have been reassigned to other tasks including virtual visits and triaging. Due to the few procedure rooms in current use, our extra nursing staff have been deployed to other areas of great need in the hospital.\n\nAdopting an incident response mentality is critical to endoscopy leadership during a time when providers and staff are asked to embrace significantly altered workflows, and both the situation and guidelines are constantly shifting (Figure 2 ). The foundation of this process is having good information upon which the best decisions can be made. This information flow includes having reliable (1) top-down information from CDC, state and local DPH, medical societies, and departmental and hospital leadership and (2) accurate assessment of relevant metrics specific to the endoscopy unit. For the latter, a combination of automated means through software and manual workflows can be used to gather important data. Initial considerations may include number of symptomatic staff, number of available reserve staff, number of active procedure rooms, local epidemiology and anticipated case burden (inpatient and outpatient), stocks of PPE, and the case composition of scheduled patients among others. Additionally, what is considered pertinent data may change over time as the pandemic evolves. It is vital to keep monitoring these metrics throughout the COVID-19 period so that any signals of potential problems can be detected early and more proactive strategies deployed. We recommend regular meetings of endoscopy leadership to review relevant information and plan in an anticipatory fashion. Last, having an upstream communication channel to hospital leadership is important, especially related to information that can affect the safety of patients and staff.\n\nWe are living through an unprecedented time and are all trying our best to protect our patients and ourselves under suboptimal conditions of limited PPE, limited testing, and limited data. However, we must continue to do the best we can, thinking creatively and strategically, planning carefully and proceeding judiciously. It is our collective responsibility to flatten the curve as soon as possible, which can only occur through our individual actions."}
