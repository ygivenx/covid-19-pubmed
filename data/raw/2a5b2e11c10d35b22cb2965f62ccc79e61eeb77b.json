{"title": "Hepatitis B: Prevalence, Hope", "body": "In the transcript of his Nobel Oration for the 1976 Award in Physiology or Medicine, Baruch S. Blumberg refers to David Surrey Dane nine times. 1 Dane (1923 Dane ( -1998 32 . Dane and his Belfast coworkers used specimens negatively stained with \"4% phosphotungstic acid at pH 6.5 and applied to formvar/carbon grids before examination in an A.E.I. EM 801 electron microscope\" 3 . Hepatitis B virus was found by Dane to be a particle 42 nm in diameter with DNA and DNA polymerase 3,32 , later eponymously named the \"Dane particle\" 32 . Dane wrote that \"I never discovered whether the person who originally referred to it this way was a well-wisher who thought we were right or someone who hoped we were wrong\" 32 .\n\nIn 1978, 19 Manx shearwaters sick with puffinosis were transported live to Oxford from Skomer and Skokholm islands. A homogenate from each freshly decapitated bird was injected separately into Oxford Dunn Pathology mice randomly inbred since 1953. One to 3 day old suckling mice were injected intracerebrally and subcutaneously. Eight to 11 day old fertile hens' eggs were injected as also were various cell cultures.\n\nTwo days after inoculation, two of the mice showed clinical signs of infection, one with paralysis. Sera from the Manx shearwaters were not collected after inoculation due to \"difficulties keeping the birds\" in Oxford 26 . The virus that was isolated differed from that found in 1948 by Stoker 33 .\n\nProbably the coronavirus at Oxford they discovered was from an Oxford Dunn School of Pathology mouse. Electron microscopy was non-diagnostic of puffinosis. Nuttal and Harrap, whose work was funded by the National Environment Research Council (NERC), stated \"We are studying puffinosis because, unlike many epizootics in wild animal populations detailed investigation is possible\" 26 \n\nAfter I went down from Cambridge, Stoker, for decades would send me, his \"perpetual student\", a postcard after I had published in the Scientific or Medical Literature. Nearly all messages were short. \"Congratulations.\" \"Surprising but believable\". \"Talk to Aage Bohr\". Re: our ICU and Thomas Huckle-\"Do it\" 43, 44 .\n\nIn \n\nEach year an estimated 887,000 humans are killed by hepatitis B 53 ; how many thousands of non-humans we do not know. Hepatitis B has solely infected humans and other hominidae and simian species for at least the last 7,000 years 54, 55 . Currently hepatitis B infects 257 million people worldwide 53, 56 . The \"Northern Ireland Hepatitis B and C Managed Clinical Network\" has reported that Northern Ireland is a \"very low prevalence country\" for hepatitis B 57 . Much progress has been made in vaccination of healthcare workers, as well as mothers and their offspring 58, 59 .\n\nInvestigators from the Regional Virus Laboratory at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, with colleagues from the Liver Unit, Department of Genitourinary Medicine and HIV and the Public Health Agency of Northern Ireland have recently suggested a higher than expected rate of progression from acute to chronic hepatitis B among persons aged 50 and over in Northern Ireland 60 . Patients co-infected with HIV show hepatitis B chronicity rates as much as six times higher than hepatitis B patients who are HIV seronegative. While such co-infection is relatively rare in Northern Ireland, the overall aging of the population amid higher hepatitis B chronicity rates emphasizes the importance of vaccination and provision of accurate information to patients. 60 \"This plague has come upon us by infection and will spread still further\" 61 \u2020 . Before you travel to foreign parts ascertain your vaccination status 56 . \u2020 \"...dedit hanc contagio labem et dabit in plures\u2026\" (Juvenal, Satvra II, 78-9).
