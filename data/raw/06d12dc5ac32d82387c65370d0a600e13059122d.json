{"title": "COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine design using reverse vaccinology and machine 1 learning 2 3", "body": "have issues in the lack of inducing complete protection and possible safety concerns 7,8 . All 77 existing SARS/MERS vaccines were reported to induce neutralizing antibodies and partial 78 protection against the viral challenges in animal models (Table 2) , but it is desired to induce 79 complete protection or sterile immunity. Moreover, it has become increasingly clear that multiple 80 immune responses, including those induced by humoral or cell-mediated immunity, are 81 responsible for correlates of protection than antibody titers alone 9 . Both killed SARS-CoV whole 82 virus vaccine and adenovirus-based recombinant vector vaccines expressing S or N proteins 83 induced neutralizing antibody responses but did not provide complete protection in animal 84 model 10 . A study has shown increased liver pathology in the vaccinated ferrets immunized with 85 modified vaccinia Ankara-S recombinant vaccine 11 . The safety and efficacy of these vaccination 86\n\nstrategies have not been fully tested in human clinical trials, but the safety can be a major 87 concern. Therefore, novel strategies are needed to enhance the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 88 vaccine development. 89\n\nIn recent years, the development of vaccine design has been revolutionized by the reverse 90 vaccinology (RV), which aims to first identify promising vaccine candidate through 91 bioinformatics analysis of the pathogen genome. RV has been successfully applied to vaccine 92 discovery for pathogens such as Group B meningococcus and led to the license Bexsero 93 vaccine 12 . Among current RV prediction tools 13,14 , Vaxign is the first web-based RV program 15 94 and has been used to successfully predict vaccine candidates against different bacterial and viral 95 pathogens [16] [17] [18] . Recently we have also developed a machine learning approach called Vaxign-ML 96 to enhance prediction accuracy 19 . 97\n\nIn this study, we first surveyed the existing coronavirus vaccine development status, and 98 then applied the Vaxign RV and Vaxign-ML approaches to predict COVID-19 protein 99 candidates for vaccine development. We identified six possible adhesins, including the structural 100 protein and non-structural proteins (including nsp3) using reverse vaccinology and machine 107 learning, we proposed and discussed a cocktail vaccine strategy, for rational COVID (Table 2) . 128 more typically mild HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1. The sequence 138 conservation suggested the potential of N protein as a candidate for the cross-protective vaccine 139 against SARS and MERS. The N protein was also evaluated and used for vaccine development 140 (Table 2 ). The N protein packs the coronavirus RNA to form the helical nucleocapsid in virion 141 assembly. This protein is more conserved than the S protein and was reported to induce an 142 immune response and neutralize coronavirus infections 23 . However, a study also showed the 143 linkage between N protein and severe pneumonia or other serious liver failures related to the 144 pathogenesis of SARS 24 . 145 146 Six adhesive proteins in SARS-CoV-2 identified as potential vaccine targets 147\n\nThe Vaxign RV analysis predicted six SARS-CoV-2 proteins (S protein, nsp3, 3CL-PRO, 148 and nsp8-10) as adhesive proteins (Table 3) . Adhesin plays a critical role in the virus adhering to 149 the host cell and facilitating the virus entry to the host cell 25 , which has a significant association 150 with the vaccine-induced protection 26 . In SARS-CoV-2, S protein was predicted to be adhesin, 151 matching its primary role in virus entry. The structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein was determined 27 152 and reported to contribute to the host cell entry by interacting with the angiotensin-converting 153 enzyme 2 (ACE2) 28 . Besides S protein, the other five predicted adhesive proteins were all non-154 structural proteins. In particular, nsp3 is the largest non-structural protein of SARS-CoV-2 155 comprises various functional domains 29 . 156 157 Three adhesin proteins were predicted to induce strong protective immunity 158\n\nThe Vaxign-ML pipeline computed the protegenicity (protective antigenicity) score and 159 predicted the induction of protective immunity by a vaccine candidate 19 . The training data 160 consisted of viral protective antigens, which were tested to be protective in at least one animal 161 challenge model 30 . The performance of the Vaxign-ML models was evaluated (Table S1 and 162 Figure S1 ), and the best performing model had a weighted F1-score of 0.94. Using the optimized 163 Vaxign-ML model, we predicted three proteins (S protein, nsp3, and nsp8) as vaccine candidates 164 with significant protegenicity scores ( Table 3 ). The S protein was predicted to have the highest 165 protegenicity score, which is consistent with the experimental observations reported in the 166 literature. The nsp3 protein is the second most promising vaccine candidate besides S protein. 167\n\nThere was currently no study of nsp3 as a vaccine target. The structure and functions of this protein 168 .

Therefore, we selected nsp3 for further investigation, as described 170 below. 171\n\nThe multiple sequence alignment and the resulting phylogeny of nsp3 protein showed that 174 this protein in SARS-CoV-2 was more closely related to the human coronaviruses SARS-CoV and 175 MERS-CoV, and bat coronaviruses BtCoV/HKU3, BtCoV/HKU4, and BtCoV/HKU9. We studied 176 the genetic conservation of nsp3 protein ( Figure 1A (Table S4 -5). In terms of linear B cell epitopes, there were 14 epitopes with BepiPred 195 scores over 0.55 and had at least ten amino acids in length (Table S6) (Table 2 ). But the inactivated or attenuated whole virus vaccine might induce strong 218 adverse events. On the other hand, vaccines targeting the structural proteins induce a strong 219 immune response 23,32,33 . In some studies, these structural proteins, including the S and N proteins, 220 were reported to associate with the pathogenesis of coronavirus 24,34 and might raise safety 221 concern 11 . Our study applied state-of-the-art Vaxign reserve vaccinology (RV) and Vaxign-ML 222 only the S protein may induce high serum-neutralizing antibody titers but cannot induce complete 231 protection 10 . In addition, HCoV-NL63 also uses S protein and employs the angiotensin-converting 232 enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cellular entry, despite markedly weak pathogenicity 35 . This suggests that the 233 S protein is not the only factor determining the infection level of a human coronavirus. Thus, 234 alternative vaccine antigens may be considered as potential targets for COVID-19 vaccines. 235\n\nAmong the five non-structural proteins being predicted as potential vaccine candidates, the 236 nsp3 protein was predicted to have second-highest protective antigenicity score, adhesin property, 237 promiscuous MHC-I & MHC-II T cell epitopes, and B cell epitopes. The nsp3 is the largest non-238 structural protein that includes multiple functional domains related to viral pathogenesis 29 . The 239 multiple sequence alignment of nsp3 also showed higher sequence conservation in most of the 240 functional domains in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, than in all 15 coronavirus 241 strains (Fig. 1B) . Besides the nsp3 protein, our study also predicted four additional non-structural 242 proteins (3CL-pro, nsp8, nsp9, and nsp10) as possible vaccine candidates based on their adhesin 243 probabilities, and the nsp8 protein was also predicted to have a significant protective antigenicity 244 score. 245\n\nHowever, these predicted non-structural proteins (nasp3, 3CL-pro, nsp8, nsp9, and nsp10) 246 are not part of the viral structural particle, and all the current SARS/MERS/COVID-19 vaccine 247 studies target the structural (S/M/N) proteins. Although structural proteins are commonly used as 248 viral vaccine candidates, non-structural proteins correlates to vaccine protection. The non-249 structural protein NS1 was found to induce protective immunity against the infections by 250 flaviviruses 36 . Since NS1 is not part of the virion, antibodies against NS1 have no neutralizing 251 activity but some exhibit complement-fixing activity 37 . However, passive transfer of anti-NS1 252 antibody or immunization with NS1 conferred protection 38 . Anti-NS1 antibody could also reduce 253 might induce cell-mediated or humoral immunity necessary to prevent viral invasion and/or 262 replication. None of the non-structural proteins have been evaluated as vaccine candidates, and the 263 feasibilit of these proteins as vaccine targets are subject to further experimental verification. 264\n\nIn addition to vaccines expressing a single or a combination of structural proteins, here we 265\n\npropose an \"Sp/Nsp cocktail vaccine\" as an effective strategy for COVID-19 vaccine development. including logistic regression, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, random forest 60 , and 315 of 14 coronaviruses besides SARS-CoV-2 were downloaded from the Uniprot (Table S2) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.20.000141 doi: bioRxiv preprint The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.20.000141 doi: bioRxiv preprint The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.20.000141 doi: bioRxiv preprint The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.20.000141 doi: bioRxiv preprint"}
