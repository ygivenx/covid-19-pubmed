{"title": "Effects of Chinese strategies for controlling the diffusion and deterioration of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in China", "body": "On December 8, 2019, the first patient with atypical pneumonia of unknown origin was reported by the government of Wuhan, Hubei, China [1] . Since then, the outbreak in Wuhan became an epidemic, rapidly spreading through China and other countries.\n\nOn January 1, 2020, a new type of coronavirus was isolated and finally named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization on February 11, 2020 [2, 3] . According to reports [4] , by March 1, 2020, more than 60 countries or areas had reported the confirmed patients with COVID-19, and more than 80,000 patients had been confirmed with COVID-19 worldwide. This has serious implications for both public health and development in China and the world.\n\nTo control the diffusion and deterioration of the epidemic of COVID-19 in China, the Chinese government implemented series of strict and unprecedented intervention strategies [5, 6] . For example, on January 21, 2020, COVID-19 was classed as a Class B infectious disease and was controlled as a Class A infectious disease; on January 23, 2020, Wuhan was quarantined to limit the diffusion of patients with COVID-19. All other provinces and areas in China also began to control public gatherings and the migration of people from January 21, 2020. These mandatory strategies carried out by the government showed significant effects on containing the contagion of COVID-19, and the number of new confirmed cases remarkably decreased at the end of February 2020.\n\nTo estimate optimally the effects of Chinese strategies on controlling the diffusion and deterioration of COVID-19 in China, we performed model fitting and calculated the time at which the growth speed of the cumulative number of confirmed patients reached the maximum.\n\nFor COVID-19 data, we collected the number of cumulative confirmed patients from January 21, 2020 to February 23, 2020 because almost all areas in China began to report confirmed cases from January 21, 2020, and the growth speed reached zero around most areas except Hubei before February 23, 2020. The number of cumulative confirmed patients with COVID-19 in different provinces or areas were acquired from the respective Health Commission websites of China. For COVID-19 data, areas of Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan were not analyzed in this study. The emigration index in mainland China was obtained from the Baidu Qianxi website (http://qianxi.baidu.com/).\n\nIn this study, we tried multiple curve models to fit known data and times. We used the following models to attempt a good fit of the data: exponential, logarithmic, power function, compound, growth, inverse, logistic, linear, quadratic, cubic, and quartic. Of these, the quartic model showed the best fit, and almost all correlation coefficients reached R 2 > 0.99 for fitted curves in different areas. With time defined as x and January 21, 2020 was recorded as the time \"1,\" the number of cumulative confirmed patients with COVID-19 (y) and time (x) were expressed as the following quartic function:\n\nThe growth speed calculation for fitted curves According to fitted curves modeled by known data, we found that almost all fitted = 4 + 3 + 2 + \u2146 + \u2147 .

This suggested that the growth speed of cumulative confirmed cases increased first and gradually decreased after reaching the maximum. Therefore, we analyzed the continuous change of the growth speed and obtained the time when the growth speed reached the maximum (Speedmax) by drawing the derivative function of the fitted curves. When the time was defined as x and January 21, 2020 was recorded as the time \"1,\" the growth speed (y') and time (x) were expressed as the following function:\n\nBy drawing the derivative function of the fitted curves, we found that changes of the growth speed (y') were accorded with our hypothesis. The growth speed (y') increases firstly and declines sequentially after reaching the Speedmax.\n\nBefore February 23, 2020, the growth speed basically reached zero (new confirmed patients\u22641 per day) for most areas except Hubei. If one area reported zero new cases for at least two days, the corresponding number of cumulative confirmed patients with COVID-19 was defined as the plateau number. If an area did not meet the criterion of zero-growth speed for two days, then the number of cumulative confirmed patients on February 23, 2020 was recorded as the plateau number.\n\nIn this study, is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.10.20032755 doi: medRxiv preprint zuotu.91maths.com/, and the point of Speedmax was calculated by this website as well.\n\nThe heat map of China was generated by the drawing instrument from http://www.dituhui.com/. \n\nIn this study, HongKong, Macao and Taiwan were not analyzed. Xizang, Xinjiang, Qinghai and Ningxia were not appropriate for Speedmax analyses because the confirmed patients were few or the growth speed was too smooth. Almost all areas in mainland China reached Speedmax within 14 days except Hebei, Heilongjiang, Hainan, Guizhou, and Hubei ( Figure 4) . Thus, the growth speed of confirmed cases began to decline in almost all areas before February 3, 2020. Because the outbreak of COVID-19 originated .

However, the plateau numbers had no significant correlation with the time of Speedmax when compared with different areas in China. In Zhejiang, though the plateau numbers ranked third among mainland China except .

This suggested that the spread of COVID-19 was controlled more quickly and effectively in Zhejiang. More detail about the number of plateaus is shown in Supplementary Table 1 .\n\nCOVID-19, a new and severe epidemic, has threatened public health and economic development in China [7] . As of March 6, 2020, the number of cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 has reached 100,000 worldwide, and some countries such as Korea, Japan, Italy, and Iran are also suffering from the rapid spread of COVID-19 [4, 7, 8] . The need for greater attention and intervention strategies to curb the spread of COVID-19 around the world is of paramount importance.\n\nTo inhibit the spread of COVID-19 as quickly as possible, the Chinese government took actions rapidly and implemented a series of strategies [5, 6, 9] To better understand and estimate the effects of Chinese strategies on controlling .

According to our analyses, the growth speed generally increased first and decreased to zero quickly after reaching the Speedmax point. The area under the curve (AUC) of the derivative function represents the cumulative number of confirmed cases. Thus, per region, a shorter time to Speedmax generally indicates a smaller AUC, representing fewer cumulative confirmed cases when reaching the plateau. Therefore, to some extent, the time to Speedmax demonstrates the effectiveness of strategies on inhibiting the spread of virus. Notably, since the plateau number is affected by multiple factors, it is inappropriate to conclude that one area with shorter Speedmax means fewer plateau number than another area with longer Speedmax. The Speedmax is useful for assessing changes of the plateau number itself.\n\nAccording to our study, we found that these Chinese strategies for controlling the diffusion of COVID-19 are significantly effective and powerful. By implementing multiple Chinese strategies, the growth speed of confirmed patients reached Speedmax and began to decline within 14 days in almost all areas of mainland China. Yang et al. [9] also reported that a five-day delay in the implementation of the Chinese strategies would have increased the epidemic size in mainland China threefold. In addition, we found that the distance from other areas to Hubei and the number of plateaus have little influence arriving at Speedmax. Once strict intervention strategies were implemented,\n\nThe present study has certain limitations. In this study, we simplified the model analysis and performed model fitting with known data. Although the classical susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) and susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) models were not adopted, the quartic model showed a good fit to known data. This helps us to learn the trends of cumulative confirmed cases quickly and easily.\n\nHowever, our fitted models were all based on known data as it was more appropriate than forecasting future data trends. In addition, the changes in trends of basic reproduction number (R0) are not discussed in our study. The effects of Chinese strategies will be better understood if the time to Speedmax and changes in R0 are discussed together. Third, more data of different infectious diseases and studies are needed to verify the effectiveness and value of the index Speedmax.\n\nIn conclusion, by analyzing the time to Speedmax, our study suggests that Chinese strategies are highly effective on controlling the diffusion and deterioration of the Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia. These strategies therefore provide experience and effective guidelines for other countries to control the diffusion of COVID-19.
