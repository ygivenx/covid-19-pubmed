{"title": "Characterisation of the faecal virome of captive and wild Tasmanian", "body": "Background 47 The Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) is the world's largest extant carnivorous marsupial 48 found only on the island state of Tasmania, Australia. Being predominantly a scavenger, the diet 49 of devils largely comprises of carrion of mammals, such as wallabies, possums and kangaroos, 50 although they are also known to consume and digest fish, insects, fruit and vegetation [1, 2] .\n\nListed as endangered, the Tasmanian devil is facing the threat of extinction due to a contagious 52 cancer, devil facial tumour disease (DFTD), that has caused drastic declines in wild devil 53 populations by 77% since its discovery in 1996 [3] . There are currently two forms of DFTD 54 affecting devils; DFT1 and DFT2 [4] .

Since the two fragments shared approximately 64% similarity to each 398 other, it suggests the presence of two distinct papillomavirus species, which we have tentatively 399 designated as Devil papillomavirus 1 and 2 (DePV1 and -2). Phylogenetic analysis based on the 400 E1 protein showed that DePV1 and 2 form a distinct cluster with Bettongia penicillata The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

In general, 475 captive populations had lower diversity in their faecal viromes compared to wild populations, as 476 measured using the chao1 metric. However, when considering bacteriophage alone, we did not 477 find any significant associations between devil populations (captive or wild) in either diversity or 478 abundance.

Omitting the 525 need for VLP enrichment and additional sample processing, the likelihood of biased detection is 526 plausibly reduced in meta-transcriptomics. In this study, the proportions of viral reads 527 sequenced by meta-transcriptomics were less than 2% per library, but the numbers of viral 528 groups detected were significantly higher than those detected in VLP metagenomics, which 529 included both RNA and DNA viruses.

Thus, more specific diagnostic techniques such as targeted PCR of blood or internal 578 tissues (i.e. liver), in situ hybridization and serological assays are required to determine whether 579 these viruses can actively replicate in devils and cause disease or are simply gut contaminants.
