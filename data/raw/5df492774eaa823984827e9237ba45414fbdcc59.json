{"title": "Systemic administration of optimized aptamer-siRNA chimeras promotes regression of PSMA-expressing tumors NIH Public Access Author Manuscript", "body": "siRNAs can be broadly used in the clinic, safe and effective approaches for their targeted delivery in vivo must be developed 11 .\n\nMost siRNA targeting approaches involve the formation of siRNA-containing complexes that also include charged peptides 12, 13 , proteins 14, 15 or polymers [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Although these reagents silence the targeted genes when administered systemically in experimental animals, their complicated formulation is likely to confound their large-scale production and regulatory approval. The potential toxicity of the materials used poses another challenge. As a result, applications involving the direct local delivery (for example, to the eye and lung) of naked or nuclease-resistant (chemically modified) siRNA duplexes have been the first to be evaluated in clinical trials 10, [21] [22] [23] [24] .\n\nWe previously developed a simple RNA-only approach for delivering cytotoxic siRNAs targeting prostate cancer-specific pro-survival genes (Plk1 and Bcl2) directly to prostate cancer cells via an RNA aptamer 25 . The aptamer portion of these chimeras binds PSMA 25, 26 , undergoes cell internalization and delivers its siRNA cargo to the intracellular RNAi machinery. This results in the silencing of the siRNA target gene and pronounced cancer cell death in vitro. When injected intratumorally, the PSMA-targeting chimera substantially decreased tumor volume in a xenograft mouse model of prostate cancer 25 , inducing apoptosis only in tumors expressing PSMA and having no adverse effects on PSMA-negative tumors or normal cells. Although the first-generation PSMA-binding aptamer/Plk1-siRNA (A10-Plk1) chimera inhibited tumor growth when administered intratumorally 25 , systemic administration will be necessary for treatment of advanced prostate cancer, thus presenting a variety of additional challenges. In particular, systemic administration requires greater therapeutic doses (leading to higher treatment costs), and carries a greater risk for harmful side effects owing to greater therapeutic exposure of nontargeted tissues. Improvements that would minimize the necessary dose of the chimera would reduce both the cost of treatment and the risk for harmful side effects. Toward this end, we have modified several aspects of the A10-Plk1chimera. The resulting optimized chimeras exhibit potent antitumor activity when administered systemically to mice bearing PSMA-positive prostate cancer tumors.\n\nWe designed second-generation PSMA-Plk1 chimeras, aiming to (i) facilitate chemical synthesis, (ii) enhance silencing activity and specificity and (iii) enable modifications to optimize in vivo kinetics. Representative second-generation PSMA-Plk1 chimeras developed in this study are shown in Figure 1 .\n\nTo facilitate chemical synthesis, we reduced the aptamer portion of the A10-Plk1chimera from 71 (corresponding to original A10 aptamer) 26 to 39 nucleotides (nt) (A10-3.2 aptamer)). The longer RNA strand of the second-generation chimeras is modified with 2\u2032-fluoropyrimidines and the shorter RNA strand is unmodified. An exception is the stem loop chimera, which is fully modified. The truncated version of the first-generation chimera (A10-Plk1) 25 is referred to as the blunt chimera, as the Plk1 siRNA is a blunted duplex (Fig. 1) , identical to the siRNA part of the first-generation chimera.\n\nTo increase the silencing activity and specificity of the A10-Plk1 chimera, we engineered several chimeras, four of which are described here with various modifications in the siRNA portion. First, a chimera with a 2-nt (UU)-overhang at the 3\u2032 end of the siRNA duplex (OVH chimera) was designed to favor recognition by the RNase enzyme Dicer 6 . Second, a wobble base pair was engineered at the 5\u2032 end of the guide (silencing) strand of the OVH chimera by introducing a mutation (C\u2192U) in the passenger strand (G-U wobble chimera). This modification was intended to increase silencing specificity by favoring loading of the guide strand into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) 7, 8, 27 . Third, we swapped the passenger and guide (Fig. 1 ) strands of the siRNA duplex (swap chimera). This configuration was intended to accommodate 5\u2032 terminal modifications of the shorter RNA strand without loss of function 28, 29 . This modification also takes advantage of strand-loading bias introduced by the interaction of the 3\u2032 overhang with the PAZ domains of Argonaute2 (Ago2) and/or Dicer. This configuration favors loading of the guide strand (strand containing 3\u2032 overhang) into RISC 30, 31 . Fourth, a stem loop chimera, where the siRNA duplex (stem) is continuous with the aptamer (loop), was designed to mimic endogenous miRNA precursors.\n\nWe tested the ability of the truncated PSMA aptamer to bind the surface of prostate cancer cells expressing PSMA (cell lines LNCaP and 22Rv1 clone 1.7). A PSMA-negative prostate cancer cell line (PC-3) was used as a control for specificity. Surface expression of PSMA was verified using flow cytometry (data not shown). To determine whether the truncated aptamer can bind the surface of cells expressing PSMA, we incubated 32 P-labeled aptamers A10 (ref. 26 ), A10-3 (57 nt) 26 and A10-3.2 with either LNCaP or PC-3 cells (Fig. 2a) . Binding of these aptamers was specific for cells expressing PSMA and was dependent on a region within A10-3.2 as this truncated RNA retained specific binding to PSMA-expressing cells. The A10-3.2 aptamer was found to bind LNCaP cells with comparable affinity to the full-length A10 RNA aptamer (Fig. 2b ).\n\nNext we tested the ability of A10-3.2 to bind to PSMA-expressing cells in the context of the modifications to the siRNA part of the chimeras (Fig. 2c ). All chimeras retained binding to PSMA-expressing prostate cancer cells. These experiments confirm that modifications made to the first-generation chimera did not affect binding or target specificity.\n\nTo determine whether the second-generation chimeras can silence target gene expression and whether they have enhanced silencing activity compared to the first-generation chimera, we tested for gene-specific silencing using quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR) (Fig. 3) . PSMAexpressing cells (22Rv1 (1.7)) were transfected with increasing amounts (4, 40, 400 nM) of A10-Plk1 or of the second-generation chimeras using a cationic lipid reagent (Fig. 3a) . As a control, cells were transfected with a control nonsilencing siRNA (Mock). Elevated expression of Plk1 in 22Rv1 (1.7) cells was confirmed using immunoblotting ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). This was specific to cancer cells as normal cells (human fibroblasts) have little-to-no Plk1 protein ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). The modifications introduced within the siRNA portion of the chimera, enhanced Plk1 silencing. The most active of the second-generation chimeras were the swap and the stem loop chimeras, which resulted in >99% silencing at concentrations as low as 4 nM.\n\nNext we verified the ability of the second-generation chimeras to silence target gene expression in the absence of transfection reagent (Fig. 3b) . 22Rv1 (1.7) cells were incubated with media containing the various RNA chimeras for 4 d. The modifications made to the siRNA portion of the chimeras substantially enhanced the chimeras' silencing potential (<10% versus >60% for A10-Plk1 and second-generation chimeras, respectively, at 4 nM concentration of the RNAs,) without affecting binding to PSMA on the cell surface. No effect was observed on PSMA-negative prostate cancer cells (data not shown). These experiments indicate that the second-generation chimeras have silencing activities >50 times stronger than that of the firstgeneration chimera A10-Plk1.\n\nWe next assessed whether Dicer can process the siRNA portion of the chimeras in the context of the A10-3.2 PSMA aptamer (Fig. 4a ). 32 P-labeled chimeras (labeled on the 5\u2032-terminus of the short RNA strand) were incubated with recombinant human Dicer for 1 h and 2 h and the cleavage products were analyzed by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. Incubation with Dicer resulted in 32 P-labeled cleaved products corresponding to the size of the duplex Plk1 siRNA (21 mer). These data suggest that the RNA chimeras are Dicer substrates. The size of the 32 Plabeled cleaved products (~21 mer) also indicates from which side Dicer enters the chimera and cleaves 32 . These results suggest that Dicer enters from the 3\u2032-end of the longer RNA strand and cleaves ~21 nt upstream. Increased levels of processed duplex in the second-generation constructs compared to the first-generation A10-Plk1 chimera suggest these may be better substrates for Dicer.\n\nNext we tested whether modifications made to the siRNA portion of the second-generation chimeras affect loading of the correct siRNA-silencing strand into RISC (Fig. 4b) . Loading of the correct strand into the RNAi machinery generates siRNAs with increased activity and reduced off-target effects 10, 31, 33 . Loading into RISC was assessed by small fragment northern (strand-bias assay) 34 . This assay allows a quantitative measure of the guide strand of the siRNA duplex that is incorporated into RISC and thereby protected from nuclease degradation. The strand that is not incorporated into RISC is rapidly degraded. The assay suggests that modifications made to the first-generation chimera substantially enhanced loading of the correct strand into RISC. Although the addition of the 2-nt (UU)-overhang at the 3\u2032 end of the siRNA duplex alone enhanced loading of the correct strand into RISC, incorporation of a wobble base at the 5\u2032 end of the guide strand had no effect. Notably, swapping the passenger strand with the guide strand resulted in a substantial increase in loading of the guide strand into RISC (Fig. 4b ). An even greater effect on strand loading was observed with the stem loop chimera, which has the same passenger guide configuration as the swap chimera (Fig. 4b) .\n\nTogether, these data indicate that the modifications made to the siRNA portion of the PSMA-Plk1 chimeras enhance silencing activity and specificity by promoting optimal RNAi processing.\n\nDepletion of Plk1 in cancer cells leads to a G2/M arrest that decreases cell proliferation and subsequent cancer cell death due to mitotic catastrophe (crisis), a type of cell death which results from mitotic DNA damage 35 . To determine whether treatment with the various PSMA chimeras results in reduced cellular proliferation, 22Rv1 (1.7) cells were transfected with each of the chimeric RNAs using a cationic lipid reagent and cell proliferation was measured by 3 H-thymidine incorporation (Fig. 5a ). Mock-treated cells (treated with control nonsilencing siRNA) were used to determine the normal rate of cellular proliferation before treatment. Cisplatin (positive control) was used to inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell death. As previously observed, silencing of Plk1 by the A10-Plk1 chimera (at 400 nM) substantially inhibited cell proliferation 25 . Lowering the concentration of A10-Plk1 to 4 nM reduced the effect on cellular proliferation by ~sixfold, whereas the second-generation chimeras still inhibited cell proliferation at such low concentrations (Fig. 5a ). This correlated with cells arrested in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, as measured by propidium iodide (PI) staining of DNA content and flow cytometry (Fig. 5b) . Nocodazole, a microtubule-depolymerizing drug, was used as a positive control to arrest cells in G2/M. Next, we determined whether the second-generation chimeras induced apoptosis in treated cells and whether modifications of the siRNA moiety increased their apoptotic activity. 22Rv1 (1.7) cells were treated with 4 nM of the various chimeras in the absence of transfection reagent. Cisplatin was used as a positive control for induction of apoptosis, which was assessed by measuring production of active caspase 3 (Casp3) by flow cytometry (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2 ). As expected, the modifications introduced within the Plk1 siRNA sequence greatly enhanced cell death from 22% (for blunt chimera) to 75 and 85% (for swap and stem loop chimeras, respectively) at a concentration of 4 nM. The swap and stem loop chimeras efficiently induced apoptosis at concentrations 100-fold lower than was necessary for the A10-Plk1 chimera (Table 1) . Together these data suggest that the modifications made to the second-generation chimeras greatly enhance silencing as well as Plk1-mediated mitotic catastrophe and subsequent cell death.\n\nWe next assessed the ability of the second-generation chimeras to limit tumor growth in athymic mice bearing tumors derived from either 22Rv1 (1.7) or PC-3 cells (Fig. 6a) . PSMA expression in tumors was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Supplementary Fig. 3a ). For the in vivo experiment, we compared the cytotoxic effects of the swap chimera to those of the blunt chimera. Athymic mice (at least ten mice per treatment group) were subcutaneously injected in the flanks with either 22Rv1 (1.7) or PC-3 cells. Both cancer cell lines express luciferase 36 , which allows measurement of tumor growth using bioluminescence imaging ( Fig.  6a and Supplementary Fig. 3b ). Mice with 22RV1 (1.7)-derived tumors were injected intraperitoneally each day for a total of 10 d (starting on day 0) with either PBS or 1 nmol each of the indicated chimeric RNAs. Mice bearing PC-3 tumors were treated only with PBS or the swap chimera. No difference in tumor volume was observed in PC-3 tumors after treatment with either PBS or the swap chimera, indicating that the swap chimera did not have nonspecific cell-killing effects (Fig. 6a) . A pronounced reduction in tumor volume was observed for 22Rv1 (1.7) tumors treated with the swap chimera (Fig. 6a) . In contrast, an increase in tumor volume was observed for tumors treated with PBS or a nonsilencing PSMA chimera, A10-3.2-Con ( Supplementary Fig. 3b) . Notably, ~70% of all swap-treated tumors completely regressed by the end of the treatment. Of the remaining, ~30% (Fig. 6a , see inset indicated by arrow for representative tumor-bearing mice), the growth rate of all tumors was slowed by as much as 2.3-fold (Fig. 6a) . Although regression of PSMA-positive tumors was most evident in swaptreated mice, tumor growth was significantly slowed in mice treated with the blunt chimera (compare PBS with blunt) (P < 0.001). No morbidity or mortality was observed following the 10-d treatment with the chimeric RNAs, suggesting that these compounds are not toxic.\n\nAs assessed with gross inspection or histological analysis, tumors from mice treated with swap (but not PBS) had liquefactive necrosis-like material that exuded from the tumor mass during gross sectioning. This coincided with large areas of necrosis commonly detected in tumors from the SWAP mice, but substantially less so in those from the PBS-treated mice (Fig. 6b) . Mitotic cells were detected in all groups including some occasional large and unusual mitotic phenotypes in swap-treated mice. TUNEL staining was seen throughout the tissues as brown staining of random individual cells and along the interface of necrotic and viable tumor tissue. No substantial difference in tumor histology was noted for PC-3 tumors treated with the swap chimera versus the PBS control, suggesting that no nonspecific uptake and subsequent processing of this chimera occurred after systemic administration.\n\nWithin each tumor type (22Rv1 (1.7) or PC-3), there were no detectable differences in cellular inflammation between treatments (for example, PBS versus swap). Moreover, cellular inflammation was uncommon and mild. Immune cells were detected only along the peripheral border of the tumor and comprised mainly scattered neutrophils with few mononuclear cells. This suggests that tumor regression is not dependent on an immune response. As an additional measure of immune responsiveness, serum from treated mice was screened for levels of interferon-\u03b1 (INT-\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) (Fig. 6c) . No differences were seen in cytokine levels of mice treated with either PBS or the A10-3.2-Con or swap chimeras. This was in contrast to mice treated with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), an established immune stimulator. These data suggest that the chimeras do not trigger an innate immune response and may be safe for in vivo applications.\n\nTo determine whether the siRNAs released from the chimeras were indeed triggering RNAi in vivo, we performed a modified 5\u2032 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR (as previously described 25 ) on mRNA from tumors of animals treated with the indicated chimeras (Fig. 6d) . Sequencing of the 5\u2032RACE-PCR products generated with Plk1-specific primers demonstrate that Ago2-mediated cleavage occurs between bases 10 and 11 relative to the 5\u2032end of the guide Plk1 siRNA strand. PCR products were not observed in samples from controltreated tumors. This result confirms specific siRNA-mediated cleavage products of Plk1 mRNA in treated tumors in vivo.\n\nWe next determined whether the addition of a 20 kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG) group could extend the circulating half-life of the swap chimera without affecting binding to PSMA ( Supplementary Fig. 4a ) or Plk1 silencing activity (Supplementary Fig. 4b) . A 20 kDa PEG was placed at the 5\u2032 end of a Plk1 siRNA passenger strand by chemical synthesis. This RNA strand included 2\u2032-fluoropyrimidines for decreased nuclease sensitivity. An analogous fully 2\u2032fluoropyrimidines-modified chimera (swap-2\u2032F) with no terminal PEG was used as a control ( Supplementary Fig. 4b) . First, we verified that the addition of PEG did not abrogate binding specificity and internalization into PSMA-positive prostate cancer cells (Supplementary Fig.  4a ) and confirmed silencing of Plk1 mRNA by the PEG-modified chimera ( Supplementary  Fig. 4b ).\n\nTo determine the in vivo half-lives of the swap-2\u2032F and swap-2\u2032F-PEG chimeras, the RNAs were intraperitoneally injected into mice and blood samples were obtained 10 min, 1 h, 5 h and 30 h later. qRT-PCR was used to quantify the amount of RNA present in each blood sample. The in vivo circulating half-life of the swap-2\u2032F chimera was substantially increased (from <35 min to >30 h) by the addition of the 20 kDa PEG (Fig. 6e, left panel) . We next addressed whether the PEGylation of the swap chimera leads to increased in vivo efficacy. Mice bearing 22Rv1 (1.7) tumors were intraperitoneally injected with a low dose (250 pmols) of the swap-2\u2032 F or swap-2\u2032F-PEG chimeras or with PBS. A total of 5 injections were performed over the course of 10 d. Tumor volume was determined as in Figure 6a . The swap-2\u2032F-PEG chimera inhibited tumor growth at substantially lower doses (Fig. 6a ,e, right panel; 10 \u00d7 1 nmol versus 5 \u00d7 250 pmols). We then determined whether inhibition of tumor growth in treated mice was correlated with silencing of Plk1 gene expression by the PSMA-Plk1 chimeras (Fig. 6f, left  panel) . Plk1 mRNA expression was significantly reduced in swap-(P < 0.01) and swap-2\u2032F-PEG-treated (P < 0.05) tumors compared to PBS control or to A10-3.2-Con.\n\nTo determine whether prolonged silencing of Plk1 gene expression might be responsible for the difference in the in vivo efficacies of the swap-2\u2032F-PEG and swap-2\u2032F chimeras (Fig. 6e) , we carried out a pharmacodynamic study to assess silencing over time ( Fig. 6f; right panel) . In this experiment, PSMA positive tumor-bearing mice were injected with two doses (1 d apart) of 1 nmol each of either swap-2\u2032F or swap-2\u2032F-PEG. Quantitative RT-PCR was then performed on mRNA from tumors to determine the amount of Plk1 mRNA in the treated tumors at the indicated time points. Plk1 mRNA silencing is observed in both swap-2\u2032F-and swap-2\u2032 F-PEG-treated tumors at 48 h but only in the swap-2\u2032F-PEG-treated tumors 5 d after the last treatment (Fig. 6f, right panel) . These data indicate that the swap-2\u2032F-PEG chimera has greater gene silencing activity in vivo.\n\nWe developed and characterized PSMA-Plk1 aptamer-siRNA chimeras with enhanced activity, specificity and in vivo kinetics relative to the first-generation PSMA-Plk1 chimera 25 . These RNA-only chimeras were optimized by incorporating modifications shown to enhance silencing activity and specificity of siRNA [6] [7] [8] 27, 30, 31, 33 . The modifications applied to the first-generation chimera include the addition of 2 nt 3\u2032-overhangs and optimization of the thermodynamic profile and structure of the duplex to favor RISC processing of the correct siRNA guide strand [6] [7] [8] 27, 30, 31 . Our targeted approach for treating prostate cancer is effective when delivered systemically and is amenable to chemical synthesis for large-scale production.\n\nAs many potential therapeutic applications of chimeras, including cancer therapy, require systemic administration of the therapeutic reagent, it is also necessary to optimize the in vivo kinetics of these chimeras, in addition to enhancing their potency and specificity. Terminal modification of RNAs with PEG increases the half-life and bioavailability of many oligonucleotide-based therapies, including RNA aptamers 28, 37, 38 . We found that addition of a 20 kDa PEG to the 5\u2032-terminus of the smaller RNA strand promotes increased retention of the chimera in serum (Fig. 6e) without affecting chimera targeting and silencing ( Supplementary Fig. 4) . The PEGylated reagent leads to prolonged-silencing in vivo (Fig. 6f , right panel) and to inhibition of tumor growth, at lower doses, in mice bearing PSMA-positive prostate tumors (Fig. 6e, right panel) . Although it is possible that the greater degree of silencing induced by the PEGylated chimera at the 5-d time point is a result of prolonged exposure of the tumor to this reagent, an alternative possibility is that this difference is due to the lingering effects of a greater initial knockdown.\n\nAs previously described for the first-generation PSMA-Plk1 chimera (A10-Plk1), cellular targeting of the optimized chimeric RNAs was mediated by the interaction of the aptamer portion of the chimeras with PSMA expressed on the surface of prostate cancer cells (Fig. 2c) . We found that the first 39 nt of the A10 PSMA aptamer are sufficient for targeting the chimeras to PSMA expressed on the surface of prostate cancer cells. This allowed us to truncate the aptamer portion of the chimeras from 71 nt to 39 nt without loss of function (Fig. 2) . Chimeras designed with such short aptamers have a long strand of \u226464 bases, a length that can be efficiently produced with chemical synthesis.\n\nDepletion of Plk1 by the 'optimized' chimeras was also specific to PSMA-positive prostate cancer cells (data not shown) and resulted in decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of the target cells in culture (Fig. 5a , Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2) . Notably, after modifications to the siRNA portion of the chimera, these effects were observed at concentrations of the reagent >50-fold lower than for the 'first-generation' chimera ( Fig. 5a and Table 1 ). In addition, we found that upon depletion of Plk1, the prostate cancer cells undergo a mitotic arrest (Fig. 5b) leading to apoptosis. Coincident with this observation, reducing Plk1 expression has been reported to lead to mitotic catastrophe (crisis) (due to arrest of cancer cells at the G2/M transition of the cell cycle) and death of prostate cancer cells 35 . Notably, this effect is specific to cancer cells; normal cells resume cell-cycle entry upon restoration of Plk1 expression 35, 39, 40 .\n\nAn additional measure of specificity was achieved by modifying the siRNA portion of the chimera to enhance loading of the guide strand into RISC (Fig. 4b) . Optimal loading of the guide strand into RISC is thought to reduce off-target effects that result from inappropriate incorporation of both siRNA strands into the silencing complex 7, 8, 27, 30, 31, 33 . Although we cannot rule out potential off-target effects mediated by the guide strand itself, these effects would likely be restricted to the tumor, as the siRNAs are targeted to PSMA-expressing prostate cancer cells (Fig. 6a) .\n\nA major advantage of the PSMA-Plk1 chimera approach as a therapeutic for advanced prostate cancer lies in its target specificity, which is achieved at the level of the aptamer (PSMAexpressing cells are specifically targeted) and at the level of the siRNA (siRNAs are designed against cancer-specific transcripts). Cancer cell-specific targeting could substantially reduce the amount of siRNA needed for effective therapy while reducing systemic cytotoxicity. Most targeted delivery approaches for siRNAs described to date involve the use of complex formulations of synthetic polymers [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , proteins 14, 15 or charged peptides 12, 13 . Although such approaches are proving effective in preclinical studies, their multicomponent formulations complicate production and safety assessment 41 . A one-component system, which involves the direct conjugation of an siRNA to an RNA aptamer, reduces the complexity of the reagent and thus simplifies manufacturing.\n\n2\u2032-fluoropyrimidines in the PSMA-Plk1 chimera increase in vivo stability and decrease immunotoxicity, and a terminal 20 kDa PEG increase serum retention. Both modifications are well characterized in humans and are reported to be well tolerated with little toxicity 10, 38 . RNA oligonucleotides with similar modifications have already been approved for use in humans (for example, Macugen), with many more quickly moving through the clinical pipeline 10, [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . Although we cannot completely rule out potential intracellular toxicity of 2\u2032 fluoropyrimidinemodified RNAs leading to nonspecific immunostimulation 10 , based on our findings (Fig. 6c) we do not expect these chimeras to produce problematic toxicity in humans.\n\nIn principle, the aptamer-siRNA chimera approach can be applied to develop reagents targeting many different cell types provided that a cell-type-specific receptor exists and that an aptamer against the receptor can be selected. The development of an aptamer-siRNA chimera that targets HIV-infected cells supports this notion 32 . The same types of modifications that enabled the in vivo efficacy of the PSMA-Plk1 chimera may thus prove useful in developing siRNAbased therapeutics for a wide variety of diseases.\n\nMethods and any associated references are available in the online version of the paper at http://www.nature.com/naturebiotechnology/.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material. Optimized PSMA-Plk1 chimeras. Blunt, truncated version of first-generation chimera (A10-Plk1) described previously 25 . The aptamer portion of the chimera has been truncated from 71 + nt to 39 nt. OVH, overhang chimera similar to blunt, but with 2 nt (UU)-overhangs at the 3\u2032 end of the siRNA duplex. G-U, G-U wobble chimera identical to OVH, but with a wobble base pair at the 5\u2032 end of the antisense siRNA strand (silencing/guide strand). Swap, sense and antisense strands of siRNA duplex are reversed. Stem loop, hairpin chimera where the siRNA duplex (stem) is continuous with the aptamer (loop). Structural predictions were generated using RNAstructure V 4.6. Binding of truncated versions of PSMA A10 aptamer and optimized chimeras to cells expressing PSMA. RNAs were end-labeled with 32 P. (a) LNCaP cells and PC-3 cells were incubated with either the full-length PSMA aptamer A10 (71 nt) or truncated versions of the PSMA aptamer, A10-3 (57 nt) or A10-3.2 (39 nt). 32 P-labeled bound/internalized RNAs were determined by liquid scintillation counter (LSC) or filter binding assay (data not shown). (b) Relative affinity of A10 PSMA aptamer and truncated A10 aptamers to cells expressing PSMA. Varying amounts (0-2 nM) of end-labeled A10, A10-3 and A10-3.2 were incubated with fixed LNCaP cells. Bound counts were determined by filter binding assay. (c) First-generation chimera (A10-Plk1) and optimized chimeras were incubated with either PC-3 cells (black bars) or LNCaP and 22Rv1 (1.7). Cells were processed as in a. Bound counts were determined with LSC. Analysis of chimera processing by the RNAi machinery. (a) In vitro Dicer processing. The 32 P-labeled PSMA-Plk1 chimeras were incubated with recombinant human Dicer enzyme for either 1 or 2 h. The Dicer cleavage or uncleaved (No Dicer) products were visualized after 15% nondenaturing PAGE. (b) Assessment of strand bias: loading of siRNA silencing strand into RISC. Small fragment northern blot of RNA isolated from 22Rv1 (1.7) cells transfected with 200 pmols of each of the optimized aptamer-siRNA chimera constructs. Loading of the siRNA silencing strand into RISC protects the siRNA strand from degradation (this can be detected with a specific probe using a modified northern blot assay). The strand that is not loaded is rapidly degraded. U6 RNA was used as a loading control. Duplex, Plk1 siRNA duplex; A10-Plk1, first-generation chimera. Blunt, OVH, G-U, swap and stem loop chimeras are described in Figure 1 . Probe controls show hybridization efficiencies of the sense and antisense probes. The varying intensities of unprocessed chimeras (upper bands on blots) are due to differential probe binding to these species and do not reflect their amounts (this same trend was observed when equal amounts of each chimera was directly loaded on gel and processed as described here (data not shown)). In vivo efficacy of optimized PSMA chimera in a xenograft model of prostate cancer. (a) 10 6 luciferase-expressing (PSMA-positive or PSMA-negative) prostate cancer cells were injected into the flanks of nude (nu/nu) mice 2 weeks before treatment with optimized chimeras. Treatment with the optimized chimeras commenced when tumors reached a volume of ~0.4 cm 3 . 1 nmol of either blunt, swap or A10-3.2-Con was administered intraperitoneally in mice bearing 22Rv1 (1.7) tumors. As a control for specificity, a mouse xenograft model of prostate cancer bearing PSMA-negative prostate cancer cells (PC-3) was also treated with the swap chimera. A total of ten treatments were administered for each treatment group. Treatment occurred every day for 10 consecutive days. Tumors were measured with calipers every other day for the course of the experiment. Saline (PBS) treated animals were used as a control. Animals were euthanized 2-3 d after the last treatment. n \u2265 10 mice per treatment group. Bottom panels: Bioluminescence imaging of 22Rv1 (1.7) and PC-3 prostate tumors was carried out after treatment with optimized chimeras (day 10). Examples show tumor growth in four"}
