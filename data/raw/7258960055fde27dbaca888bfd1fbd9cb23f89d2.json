{"title": "A single MIU motif of MINDY-1 recognizes K48-linked polyubiquitin chains", "body": "Ubiquitylation is a protein modification that regulates a plethora of cellular signaling [1] [2] [3] [4] . The 76-residue ubiquitin (Ub) is attached to Lys residues of target substrates through an enzymatic cascade that involves Ub-activating enzyme (E1), Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2), and Ub-ligating enzyme (E3) [5] . Ub itself has seven Lys residues and an N-terminal Met residue that can be ubiquitylated, which results in the formation of eight types of polyubiquitin (polyUb) chains: M1, K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, and K63 [6] . The different chain types are associated with different cellular functions, and they adopt distinct conformations. For example, K48-linked polyUb chains that target proteins for proteasomal degradation adopt compact conformations [7] . Indeed, K48-linked polyUb chains have also been observed in open conformations, reflecting the flexible nature of polyUb chains [8, 9] . Proteins containing Ub-binding domains (UBDs) recognize these distinct conformations of polyUb chains and translate the different Ub signals to produce distinct outcomes [10] . Since Ub signals regulate diverse cellular processes, they have to be removed and regulated, and this function is mainly performed by dedicated proteases called deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) [11] .\n\nTo date, there are 21 families of UBDs reported, which vary in size, structure, and mode of binding with Ub [10, 12] . Ub-interacting motif (UIM) and motif interacting with Ub (MIU) are the smallest among the UBDs. Both motifs form an a-helical structure composed of~20 residues [13] [14] [15] [16] . They bind to monoUb through hydrophobic residues centered on a key alanine that interacts with the hydrophobic I44 patch (L8, I44, H68, and V70) on Ub. The signature motif of the MIU is the inverse of a UIM, which explains why monoUb binds MIU in a reverse orientation than when bound to UIM [15, 16] .\n\nThe affinity of a UIM for monoUb is relatively weak with dissociation constants (K d ) in the range of 100 lM to 2 mM [17] . The MIU of Rabex-5 has slightly higher affinity for monoUb at~30 lM [15, 16] . To compensate for the weak affinities, many proteins contain arrays of more than one UIM or MIU motifs, which provide avidity to bind polyUb chains with relatively higher affinity [13, 15, 16, [18] [19] [20] [21] . In some UBDs, these arrangements also determine the linkage-selective binding for polyUb. For instance, in the tandem UIM of Rap80, each UIM motif binds to a single Ub and the linker between the two motifs determines the orientation of the binding surfaces on the individual UIMs, thereby imparting specificity in binding to polyUb of K63 linkage type [18, 19] .\n\nWe recently reported the discovery of a new family of DUBs called MINDY (MIU-containing novel DUB family) that is highly selective at cleaving K48-linked polyUb chains [22] . The first member identified in this family, FAM63A/MINDY-1, contains a tandem MIU repeat (tMIU) that is highly specific for binding to K48linked polyUb chains. The tMIU enables efficient cleavage of long polyUb chains by MINDY-1. In order to understand the molecular mechanism of how the tMIU of MINDY-1 specifically recognizes K48 chains, we biochemically and biophysically analyzed its Ub binding in detail. Our results reveal an atypical mode of polyUb recognition where the second MIU (MIU2) on its own contains all the specificity determinants. MIU2 makes contacts with all three Ub moieties in a K48-linked polyUb chain via three different binding sites on the MIU. The first MIU (MIU1) further contributes to polyUb binding through avidity despite itself being a poor binder for polyUb chains. Collectively, our results provide new concepts for polyUb recognition by MIU motifs.\n\nMINDY-1 contains a tandem MIU repeat, highly selective at binding K48-polyUb chains Preferences of tandem UIMs for binding to one linkage type of polyUb chains over the other have been described [13, 18, 19, 23] . However, such analyses were limited to only few chain types, mostly K48 and K63 linkages. Only recently, enzymatic methods to assemble large quantities of pure polyUb chains of M1, K6, K11, K29, K33, K48, and K63 were established [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . These chains are invaluable reagents for UBD linkage profiling that led for instance to the identification of NZF1 of TRABID as a K29-and K33-polyUb selective binder [27] . When profiled against tetraUb of seven linkage types, we confirmed the exclusive preference of Rap80 and Epsin-15 tUIMs for binding to K63 polyUb chains [18, 19] (Fig EV1A) . We found that S5a tUIM that was previously reported to bind K11, K48, and K63 chains also captures M1 polyUb chains [23, 32] (Fig EV1A) . The tandem A20_ZnF-MIU domain of Rabex-5 previously reported to capture M1-, K48-, and K63-polyUb chains [15, 16, 33, 34] also binds to tetraUb linked via K6, K11, K29, and K33 ( Fig EV1A) . Our results demonstrate that using a panel of tetraUb chains in Halo-tagged UBD pull-down assays can reveal the linkage preference of a given UBD.\n\nBased on sequence analysis, we discovered that two previously uncharacterized proteins, FAM63A and FAM63B, contain a tandem repeat of two MIU motifs at the C-terminus (Figs 1A and B, and EV1B and C). In our recent study, we characterized these two proteins to be DUBs of a novel family, which we named MINDY (MIU-containing novel DUB family) [22] . While the sequences of the MIU motifs are highly conserved between the two proteins, the linker region connecting the two motifs is not (Fig 1A) . Despite this similarity, the tMIU of FAM63A/MINDY-1 is highly specific for binding to K48 chains, whereas the tMIU of FAM63B/MINDY-2 is non-specific and binds to polyUb chains of different linkage types ( Fig 1C) . We therefore wanted to understand how the tMIU of MINDY-1 achieves linkage specificity for K48 chains.\n\nWe first evaluated the contribution of each MIU motif of MINDY-1 towards polyUb binding. Mutating the key central alanine of the MIU motif to glycine has been reported to disrupt the motif from binding to monoUb [16] . We therefore mutated the central alanine or deleted the whole motif of MIU1 or MIU2 and tested the effect of such mutations on K48-linked tetraUb binding. Mutating or deleting MIU1 did not disrupt binding to K48-tetraUb (Fig 2A, lanes 4 and  6) . In contrast, mutating or deleting MIU2 completely abolished binding to K48-tetraUb (Fig 2A, lanes 3 and 5) . These observations were further confirmed in pull-down assays of ubiquitylated materials from HEK293 cells (Fig 2B) . Together, our data suggest that MIU2 is the dominant polyUb chain binder in MINDY-1.\n\nTandem UIMs and MIUs have been reported to prefer binding to longer polyUb chains [13, 16, 20, 21, [35] [36] [37] [38] . Pull-downs from HEK293 cell extracts using MINDY-1 tMIU did not capture lower molecular weight polyUb chains, suggesting a preference for binding to longer polyUb chains (Fig 2B) . To investigate this further, we incubated Halo-tagged tMIU with K48-linked polyUb chains of different lengths that varied from monoUb to pentaUb (Fig 2C) . We found that the tMIU binds to tri-, tetra-, and pentaUb, but does not bind to monoUb and diUb, supporting a preference of tMIU to bind longer polyUb chains. To measure the affinity of the tMIU for polyUb chains of varying lengths, we performed ITC measurements where MINDY-1 tMIU was titrated into either K48-diUb, triUb, or tetraUb (Fig 2D-F) . We observed affinities of 23 lM, 1.2 lM, and 185 nM for diUb, triUb, and tetraUb, respectively, suggesting that the affinity of MINDY-1 tMIU for polyUb chains increases with chain length. Collectively, our results demonstrate that MINDY-1 tMIU preferably binds to longer K48-linked polyUb chains.\n\nTo explore the role of MIU1 in the binding of MINDY-1 tMIU to polyUb chains, we compared the binding of MIU1 and MIU2 on their own to K48-triUb by ITC. If MIU1 has no role in overall binding, we predict the affinity of MIU2 for K48-triUb to be the same as that observed with tMIU. Consistent with our previous finding, MIU1 on its own has no measurable affinity toward polyUb chains ( Fig 2G) . Surprisingly, we found that the affinity of the tMIU containing both MIU1 and MIU2 for K48-triUb is 10-fold higher than that of MIU2 on its own (Fig 2H) . This suggests that even though the affinity of the isolated MIU1 for K48-triUb is negligible, it contributes to tMIU binding through avidity.\n\nSince MIU1 only provides weak binding to polyUb chains, we hypothesize that MIU2 is the main determinant of K48-linkage selectivity. When Halo-tagged MIU2 was incubated with a panel of seven types of polyUb chains, it only captured K48-tetraUb ( Fig 2I) . This implies that on its own MIU2 is still selective for K48 linkages and is therefore the linkage specificity determinant in MINDY-1 tMIU.\n\nEven though MIU2 is sufficient to capture K48-linked polyUb chains, MIU1 is still required for the tMIU to bind polyUb chains with higher affinity. However, it remains unclear whether MIU1 also contributes to the overall linkage selectivity of the tMIU. To address this, we first explored the contribution of the linker separating the two motifs. One major difference between the K48-linkage-specific MINDY-1 tMIU and the linkage-unspecific MINDY-2 tMIU is their linker length and composition ( Fig 1A) . In Rap80, the linker length in between two UIM motifs defines the specificity for K63-linked polyUb [18, 19] . Therefore, to test whether the linker length and composition of MINDY-1 tMIU regulate polyUb binding, we replaced the 5-residue linker of MINDY-1 tMIU with the one of MINDY-2 tMIU. Swapping the linker made no difference to linkage specificity of the tMIU (Fig 3A, lane 6) . The presence of two proline residues results in a rigid linker (Fig 1A) . To make the linker relatively flexible, we mutated the two proline residues to alanine or replaced the whole linker with poly-Ser-Gly or poly-Ala linker (Fig 3A, lanes  7-9) . Again, we found that altering the composition of the linker does not convert the K48-linkage specificity of the tMIU. In summary, the length and composition of the linker do not affect the specificity of MINDY-1 tMIU for K48-linked polyUb chains.\n\nDespite being very similar to the tMIU of MINDY-1, it is intriguing that the tMIU of MINDY-2 binds to polyUb chains of all linkage types ( Fig 1C) . We therefore characterized the binding properties of the individual MIU motifs of MINDY-2 and found that the first MIU (MIU1) motif of MINDY-2 is the dominant Ub binder, whereas the second motif (MIU2) shows no detectable binding ( Fig 3B) . Further, MINDY-2 MIU1 has no linkage selectivity as it captures polyUb chains of all linkage types ( Fig 3C) . The affinity of MINDY-2 MIU1 on its own to polyUb chains is weaker compared to the tMIU (Figs 3C and 1C). This suggests that similar to MINDY-1, the weak polyUb-binder MIU2 in MINDY-2 also contributes to overall polyUb binding of the tMIU through avidity.\n\nWe then wondered whether replacing MIU1 of MINDY-1 with a motif that binds non-selectively to polyUb chains could alter the linkage preference of MINDY-1 tMIU. First, we tested whether introducing a K48-selective MIU at the position of MIU1 alters the specificity of the tandem MIU. When analyzed, a tandem repeat of the K48-selective MINDY-1 MIU2 is still K48-linkage selective and in fact appears to bind to K48 chains with higher affinity (Fig 3D top) . Next, we performed a domain swap, where we replaced MINDY-1 MIU1 with the non-selective polyUb binder of MINDY-2 MIU1. The hybrid tMIU is no longer K48-selective and binds to K6, K11, K48, and K63 chains, which is similar to the profile of MINDY-2 tMIU ( Fig 3D bottom and Fig 1C) . Thus, within the tMIU, having a non-selective polyUb binder at the position of MIU1 converts the K48-specific binder to a non-specific one. In summary, the weak polyUb-binding property of MIU1 allows MIU1 to work in synergy with MIU2 to increase the affinity of MINDY-1 tMIU for polyUb without altering its selectivity for K48-linked polyUb chains.\n\nTo understand how MINDY-1 MIU2 specifically recognizes K48linked polyUb and how this interaction is enhanced by MIU1, we attempted to crystallize the tMIU in complex with K48-triUb. Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain any crystals. We therefore crystallized the tMIU in complex with K48-diUb and these crystals diffracted to 2.0 \u00c5 . The structure was solved by molecular replacement using Ub as a search model. There are two Ub moieties present in the asymmetric unit (ASU) (Fig 4A) . Although discernible electron density is not present for the linkage between the two Ub moieties, L73 of the distal Ub is pointing towards K48 of the proximal Ub. Clear electron density was visible for a helix, which was manually built in and the structure was refined to the final statistics shown in Appendix Table S1 . To our surprise, only one 4-turn-helix corresponding to MIU2 (residues 408-426) could be modeled into\n\nUb4 25% input Ub4:\n\nHalo-UBD pulldown silver staining MINDY-1 tMIU Interestingly, when we analyzed the crystal packing, we found that the diUb from the ASU makes contact with the diUb from the symmetry-related molecule, forming a cyclic K48-linked tetraUb chain (Fig 4B) . This cyclic chain adopts a doughnut-like shape with two grooves at its center where the two MIU2 molecules bind ( Fig EV2A) . The hydrophobic I44 patches are no longer at the interface between Ub moieties, and therefore, this cyclic K48-tetraUb chain is in an open conformation.\n\nTo date, four structures of K48-tetraUb chains have been solved [8, [39] [40] [41] . In three of these structures (1F9J, 2O6V, and 3ALB), K48linked tetraUb forms cyclic chains. However, these are all in closed conformations where the I44 patches of all the Ub moieties are buried in the interface (Fig 4C middle) . Even though the other crystal structure of K48-tetraUb is in an open conformation (1TBE), the fourth and the first Ub moieties are not linked and therefore is a non-cyclic chain and different from the K48-tetraUb chain observed in this study (Fig 4C right) . Interestingly, looking further into the symmetry-related molecules, we can also model an open non-cyclic K48-tetraUb ( Fig EV2B) . However, the distance between K48 and G76 of the second and third Ub moieties (~11 \u00c5 ) is too far apart for an isopeptide bond to form. Therefore, this conformation is less likely to exist in nature. In summary, we here report a novel structure of open cyclic K48-linked tetraUb chains when in complex with two MINDY-1 MIU2 motifs.\n\nThe four Ub moieties of the cyclic K48-tetraUb chain are wrapped around the two MIU2 helices (Fig 4B) . In such an arrangement, a A K48-linked tetraUb chains were captured by Halo-tagged tMIU wild type or mutants of MINDY-1 as in Fig 1C. Red and gray squares indicate wild-type and mutant MIU (Ala-to-Gly), respectively. PD, pull-down. B\n\nHEK293 cell lysates (1 mg) were incubated with 1.05 nmol Halo-tagged tMIU wild type or mutants. The captured Ub was visualized by anti-Ub immunoblotting. C MonoUb and K48-linked polyUb chains of different lengths (29 pmol each) were incubated with 1.05 nmol of Halo-tagged tMIU. The captured materials were visualized as in Fig 1C. Asterisks indicate non-specific bands from Halo-UBD, which exhibit a similar electrophoretic mobility as tri-and pentaUb.

A B C The captured materials were analyzed as in Fig 1C. Asterisks indicate non-specific bands from Halo-UBD, which run at a similar electrophoretic mobility as K63-tetraUb. PD, pull-down. B K48-or K63-linked tetraUb chains were captured by Halo-tagged tMIU wild type or mutants of MINDY-2 as in Fig 2A. Blue and gray squares indicate wild-type and mutant MIU (Ala-to-Gly), respectively. Asterisks indicate non-specific bands from Halo-UBD. C PolyUb linkage selectivity assay of MINDY-2 MIU1 was carried out as in Fig 1C. Asterisks indicate non-specific bands from Halo-UBD. D PolyUb linkage selectivity assays of hybrid tMIUs were carried out as in Fig 1C. (Figs 5A and B , and EV3A). Only K48-linked polyUb chains can adopt this conformation, as K48 is the only lysine residue within close proximity to the C-terminus of the distal Ub (Fig EV3B) . This structure of MIU2 with K48-linked triUb explains the preference of MINDY-1 to bind to longer polyUb chains (Fig 2) .\n\nThe first binding interface (Site 1) is formed through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds between MIU2 and the middle Ub (Figs 5C and EV3C ). This mode of binding is similar to the one reported for Rabex-5 MIU and monoUb [15, 16] . The conserved A416 of MIU2 is buried deep within the I44 patch of the middle Ub. As with other MIUs and UIMs, mutation of A416 completely abolishes polyUb binding (Figs 5F and EV4C) . L413, L415, and L419 that surround A416 also contribute in binding to I44 patch. The hydrogen bonds are formed between the side chains of D412 and Q420 and the main chains of Ub A46, G47, and L71. In addition to this, the side chains of MIU2 Q420 and Ub R42 and R72 also interact. Indeed, mutating residues D412, Q420, or E423 on MIU2 significantly reduces tMIU binding to K48-tetraUb, highlighting the importance of these Site 1 interactions (Fig 5G) . Collectively, these networks of hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds suggest a tight binding of the middle Ub to MIU2. The second binding interface (Site 2) is formed between MIU2 and the proximal Ub, which occupies a smaller buried surface area of~240 \u00c5 2 in comparison with Site 1 (~500 \u00c5 2 ) and Site 3 (~480 \u00c5 2 ) (Fig 5A) . The proximal Ub is bound by MIU2 in an unusual way, where a bulky hydrophobic residue on Site 2, Y424, mediates key interactions-the hydrophobic aromatic ring of Y424 interacts with the I44 patch of the proximal Ub, and the hydroxyl group of Y424 interacts with the main chain amide group of A46 and G47 (Fig 5D) . These interactions are analogous to MIU2 A416 and D412 on Site 1, respectively ( Fig 5C) . Mutating Y424 to Ala or acidic residues, but not Phe or Trp, abolishes tMIU binding to K48-tetraUb, confirming the crucial role of the hydrophobic aromatic ring for Ub binding (Fig 5H) . Y424 also interacts with L73 of the middle Ub and therefore highlights the key role of Y424 in stabilizing MIU2 interaction with polyUb. In other MIU motifs, the position corresponding to Y424 is commonly occupied by acidic residues, and therefore, the mode of binding by Y424 is a unique feature of MINDY-1 MIU2 (Fig 5B) .\n\nThe third binding interface (Site 3) is formed between MIU2 and the distal Ub, which was determined from crystal contacts with the symmetry-related molecule (Fig 4A and B) . MIU2 L408, T411, L415, and L419 interact with the hydrophobic patch on the distal Ub formed by I36, P37, L71, and L73 (Fig 5E) . In addition, the side chains of MIU2 T411, Q418, and Q421 form hydrogen bonds with the main chains of Ub I36, L71, and L8, respectively. Further interactions between the side chains of MIU2 E422 and Ub R72 reinforce the binding. To determine the contribution of Site 3 to polyUb binding, we individually mutated residues forming Site 3. With the exception of L415 and L419, mutation of L408, T411, Q418, Q421, or E422 did not disrupt polyUb binding of the tMIU (Fig 5B,  F and G) . L415 and L419 also bind to the middle Ub (Site 1), and therefore, the loss of binding observed upon mutating these residues could be a result of simultaneously disrupting Site 1 interaction with the middle Ub.\n\nMINDY-1 tMIU binds to K48-linked polyUb chains with higher affinity than MIU2 on its own (Fig 5E and H) . We therefore postulate that MIU1 may mediate additional interactions with the distal Ub, which may compensate for the mutations on MIU2 Site 3 (Fig 5J) . To test this hypothesis, we mutated residues on Site 3 in MIU2 and found that in the absence of MIU1, mutating L415, Q418, and L419 abolishes binding to polyUb (Fig 5I) . This suggests that the residual binding of L415, Q418, and L419 mutants observed in tMIU was due to MIU1 binding to Ub. In addition to highlighting the contribution of Site 3 of MIU2 to Ub binding, these observations suggest that MIU2 binding to the distal Ub is enhanced by MIU1 through mechanisms yet to be elucidated (Fig 5J) .\n\nMIU2 A416 and Y424 bind the middle Ub and proximal Ub, respectively, in an orientation that can only be accommodated by K48-linked diUb, which explains the linkage selectivity of MIU2 (Figs EV4A and EV3B ). This mode of binding is analogous to Rap80 tUIM, where the linker connecting the two UIMs of Rap80 stretches and positions the interacting surfaces of the two UIMs in an orientation that only K63-linked diUb can accommodate (Fig EV4B) [18, 19] . Altering the distance between the key alanine residues of the two UIMs abrogates Rap80 tUIM binding to K63 chains [19] . To test whether MINDY-1 MIU2 also employs the same mode of binding, we altered the distance between the two binding sites within MIU2 by deleting E423 or introducing Ala residues in-between A416 and Y424 (Fig EV4D) . Indeed, altering the distance between these two key residues completely disrupts tMIU binding to polyUb chains (Fig EV4D-F) . These results highlight the importance of the spatial arrangement of the two Ub-binding sites within MINDY-1 MIU2 to bind Ub moieties within K48-linked polyUb chains.\n\nIndividual UIM motifs in Hrs and AIRAPL have been reported to contain multiple Ub-binding sites [20, 42] . Hrs UIM has two hydrophobic strips on either side of its helix, which each binds to the I44 patch of independent Ub molecules [42] . The two Ub molecules bound to Hrs are not linked by any isopeptide bond, and therefore, the double-sided Ub-binding on Hrs UIM does not provide linkage specificity but a higher efficiency in binding to multiple monoubiquitylated cargoes in the endocytic pathway [42] . On the \u25c0 Figure 5 . Mechanism of polyUb chain recognition by MIU2.\n\nStructure of MIU2 in complex with K48-linked triUb is shown in cartoon. K48-triUb proximal (light cyan) and middle (blue) Ub are from the asymmetric unit, while the distal Ub (teal) is from a symmetry-related molecule (Fig 4B) .

The conserved motif of MIU is shown: \u0278, large hydrophobic; #, acidic; x, any residues. C-E Close-up views of interactions between MINDY-1 MIU2 and the middle Ub (Site 1), proximal Ub (Site 2), or distal Ub (Site 3). Hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds are shown on the top and bottom panels, respectively. Residues at the interface are shown in sticks and colored as in (A). Dotted lines indicate hydrogen bonds. F, G Residues of MIU2 involved in hydrophobic interactions (F) and hydrogen bonds (G) were mutated, and the effect on tMIU binding to K48-tetraUb was investigated as in Fig 2A.  H Role of Y424 in tMIU binding to K48-tetraUb was investigated by mutating MIU2 Y424 to the indicated residues, and pull-down assays were performed as in Fig 2A . other hand, the tUIM of AIRAPL recognizes K48-linked triUb where the two Ub-binding sites on UIM2 bind to two moieties of Ub simultaneously, whereas UIM1 binds to the proximal Ub [20] . Even though AIRAPL UIM2 was described as the K48 linkage determinant for the tUIM, in the absence of UIM1, AIRAPL UIM2 failed to bind K48-triUb. In contrast, a single MIU motif in MINDY-1, MIU2, uses distinct mechanisms in which the three Ub-binding sites on the MIU simultaneously bind to all three Ub moieties (Fig 5J) . K48-linked polyUb chains are flexible and adopt different conformations as both open and closed chains have been reported for unbound chains [9] . However, all structures of K48-linked diUb chains in complex with their binding partners are found in open conformations where at least one of the two I44 patches is occupied [20, [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . The two K48-diUb chains bound to MINDY-1 MIU2 are also in open conformations and suggest a preference for UBDs to bind to K48 chains in more extended conformations ( Fig EV2C) . In contrast, K63-linked polyUb chains in complex with their binding partners have been observed in both open and closed chain conformations [48] . It is intriguing that none of the UBDs analyzed to date recognize and bind to the closed conformation of K48 chains.\n\nIt is interesting that MINDY-1 tMIU, in addition to sensing polyUb chain linkage type, can also select for chain length (Fig 2) . In our recent study, we demonstrated that tMIU is required for MINDY-1 DUB activity in hydrolyzing long K48-linked polyUb chains [22] . In the present study, we observe that MINDY-1 MIU2 binds to K48-polyUb chains in open conformations (Fig 5A) . We hypothesize that the tMIU helps MINDY-1 bind to long K48 chains and therefore facilitates the DUB to bind to its substrate (Fig EV4G) .\n\nOur study also reveals that despite its sequence similarity with MINDY-1 tMIU, FAM63B/MINDY-2 tMIU is completely non-specific for any particular linkage type (Fig 1C) . Interestingly, full-length MINDY-2 selectively hydrolyzes only K48 chains [22] . These observations suggest that the tMIU of MINDY-2 may enable the enzyme to process mixed and branched Ub types. Future work will elucidate how the UBD and the catalytic domain of MINDY-1 and MINDY-2 work together in a cellular context.\n\nAll cDNA clones were generated by the DNA cloning team, Medical Research Council Protein Phosphorylation and Ubiquitylation Unit (MRC PPU) Reagents and Services, University of Dundee, United Kingdom (Appendix Table S2 ). Anti-Ub was purchased from DAKO (Z0458).\n\nUBDs were cloned as fusion proteins with an N-terminal GST tag or a tandem GST-Halo tag (Appendix Table S2 ). Recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 grown in 2\u00d7 TY media containing 100 lg/ml ampicillin. Cells were induced with 300 lM isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at an OD 600 of 0.6-0.8 and grown for 16 h at 16\u00b0C. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.075% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM benzamidine, 1 mM AEBSF, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Cell lysis was carried out by sonication. After being clarified through centrifugation, bacterial lysate was incubated with Glutathione Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare) for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. The resin bound proteins were washed extensively with high salt buffer (25 mM Tris pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT) and low salt buffer (25 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM DTT). Halo-tagged UBD was eluted by cleaving off the GST tag using C3 protease. The purified proteins were concentrated, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u00c080\u00b0C.\n\nPolyUb chains were assembled enzymatically in reactions containing 1,500 lM Ub (Sigma Aldrich), 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 0.6 mM DTT, and 10 mM ATP, incubated at 30\u00b0C for the indicated period of time. M1 chains were assembled for 2 h in the presence of 1 lM UBE1, 10 lM UBE2L3, and 10 lM HOIP [24] . K6 chains were assembled for 3 h in the presence of 0.5 lM UBE1, 9.5 lM UBE2L3, 12.40 lM NleL (170-782), and 5 lM OTUB1 [25] . K11 chains were assembled for 6 h in the presence of 1 lM UBE1, 40 lM UBE2S-UBP, and 2 lM AMSH [26] . Fresh DUB was added, and the reaction was incubated for another 16 h. K29 chains were assembled for 6 h in the presence of 0.64 lM UBE1, 9.5 lM UBE2D3, and 3 lM UBE3C [27] . K33 chains were assembled for 6 h in the presence of 0.5 lM UBE1, 9 lM UBE2D1, and 6.3 lM AREL1 [28] . In the K29 and K33 chains assembly, DUBs (2 lM vOTU for K29, and 5 lM OTUB1 + 20 lM Cezanne E287K/E288K for K33) were added after the 6-h incubation and the reaction was incubated for another 16 h. K48 chains were assembled for 6 h in the presence of 1 lM UBE1 and 25 lM UBE2R1 [49] . K63 chains were assembled for 3 h in the presence of 1 lM UBE1, 10 lM UBE2N, and 20 lM UBE2V1 [49] .\n\nAt the end of the assembly reaction, enzymes used in the reaction were precipitated by the addition of a total volume of 50 ml of 50 mM sodium acetate pH 4.5. After at least 3-h incubation at 4\u00b0C, the solution was filtered (0.22-lm). DiUb, triUb, tetraUb, and pentaUb were purified by cation exchange using a Resource S 6 ml column (GE Healthcare), equilibrated in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 4.5, and eluted in a gradient with elution buffer (50 mM sodium acetate pH 4.5 and 1 M NaCl). Peak fractions containing di-, tri-, tetra-, and pentaUb chains were concentrated and buffer exchanged to 20 mM Tris pH 7.5.\n\nHalo-tagged UBDs (10.5 nmol) were incubated with 100 ll of the HaloLink resin (Promega) in 500 ll of the coupling buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% NP-40 substitute, and 1 mM DTT) for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. The UBD linkage selectivity analysis was carried out by incubating 10 ll of the coupled Halo-UBD with 29 pmol of tetraUb of the indicated linkages in 500 ll of pull-down buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP-40, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mg/ml BSA) for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. The resin was washed two times with the wash buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 0.2% NP-40, 1 mM DTT) and once with the coupling buffer. Captured tetraUb chains were eluted by adding LDS buffer, separated on 4-12% Bis-Tris gel (Thermo Fischer), and visualized by silver staining using Pierce Silver stain kit (ThermoFischer).\n\nITC measurements were performed on a MicroCal PEAQ-ITC (Malvern) at 25\u00b0C with a setting of 20 \u00d7 2 ll injections. All proteins were dialyzed into 50 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 250 lM TCEP. For all measurements, the syringe contained UBD at a concentration of 300 lM, and the cell contained polyUb chains at a concentration of 30 lM.\n\nCrystallization and structure determination of MINDY-1 tMIU:K48-diUb\n\nPurified MINDY-1 tMIU and K48-linked diUb were mixed in 1:1 ratio at 400 nmol each. After an 16-h incubation, the protein complex was concentrated to 16.3 mg/ml. Crystals were grown using vapor diffusion technique in mother liquor containing 100 mM sodium acetate pH 5.4 and 18.5% PEG3350. Crystals were cryo-protected in mother liquor containing 30% PEG400 before vitrification in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at ID30A of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). Data were processed and scaled using XDS [50] and merged using AIMLESS [51] . The structure was solved by molecular replacement using Ub (1UBQ [52] ) as a search model in Phaser [53] . Iterative rounds of refinements were done using REFMAC5 [54] with model building in COOT [55] . The structure was finally re-refined using PDB_REDO [56] . The final data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Appendix Table S1 .\n\nThe structure was analyzed with PIC and PISA [57, 58] . Figures were made with the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC (https://www.pymol.org/).\n\nCoordinates for MINDY-1 tMIU:K48-diUb complex have been deposited at the Protein Data Bank under accession codes 5MN9.\n\nExpanded View for this article is available online."}
