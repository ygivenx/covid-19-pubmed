{"title": "Airway and serum biochemical correlates of refractory neutrophilic asthma", "body": "The majority of asthmatic patients respond well to controller medications, such as inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting b-agonists. However, a subset of patients does not respond to multiple controller medications, including omalizumab, and their asthma symptoms remain poorly controlled. This group of patients is labeled as having refractory asthma (RA) or severe asthma. 1-3 These patients experience a high level of morbidity because of the disease. Many of these patients require chronic systemic steroid therapy, which results in severe side effects and adds to the morbidity. Because of heavy use of health care services (emergency department and hospital), patients with RA account for a disproportionately higher health care cost. 2 It is estimated that about 3% to 10% of patients have severe RA. [2] [3] [4] [5] The treatment options for RA are limited, primarily because of the lack of understanding of its mechanisms.\n\nAsthma is a heterogeneous disease. Based on clinical and laboratory findings, asthma has been variably classified as atopic versus nonatopic asthma, eosinophilic versus neutrophilic versus noneosinophilic/nonneutrophilic asthma, obesity-associated asthma, 3 asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome, 6 T H 2-high asthma, 7 T H 2/T H 17-high asthma, 8 and T H 2-low asthma, 7, 8 for example. Severe asthma and RA can occur within each category of patients. It is unclear whether a single or multiple mechanisms are operating in patients with severe RA. Previous studies have identified a number of factors in patients with severe asthma. Heightened activation of type 1 (T H 1, the interferon pathway), 9 type 2 (T H 2 cells, type 2 CD8 T cells), 7 11 and airway neutrophilia 12 have all been implicated in patients with RA. Levels of the type 3 cytokines IL-17A and IL-17F are increased in asthmatic patients. 8, 13 However, they were not associated with levels of T H 17 cytokines in human asthma nor were they associated with neutrophilic asthma, [13] [14] [15] which is unlike what has been reported in the mouse model of asthma. 16 Increased epithelial injury, smooth muscle hyperplasia and hypertrophy, and airway remodeling are some of the recognized intrinsic factors of RA. 1, 2 The external factors associated with RA include heightened exposure to sensitizing allergens, 17, 18 air pollution, 19, 20 and infections. [21] [22] [23] Heightened levels of select cytokines/inflammatory mediators were associated with many of the foregoing subgroups of RA. 23, 24 Despite progress in the field, there is a need to examine the precise molecular mechanism of heterogeneity of RA that allows development of targeted therapeutic interventions. To address this matter, we studied 60 patients with RA 3 and compared them with 30 patients with nonrefractory asthma (NRA) and 20 healthy control subjects. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and serum were analyzed for 244 biomolecules, levels of which were then correlated with the clinical and laboratory features of asthma. The latter included pulmonary function, PC 20 for methacholine, allergic sensitivity, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), body mass index, blood eosinophil counts, total IgE levels, BAL fluid inflammatory cell counts (eosinophil, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and macrophage counts), indices of airway tissue inflammation (quantitative histologic evaluation of bronchial tissue) and basement thickness, and the results of microbiological studies with BAL, tissue biopsy, and airway brushing. The focus of this article is on the neutrophilic phenotype of RA.\n\nStudy subjects with RA were recruited from outpatient clinics of National Jewish Health. Patients with NRA and healthy control subjects were recruited from the community. The study protocol for bronchoscopy and BAL was approved by the institutional review board (HS#2639). Written informed consent was obtained from the study subjects. Patients were allowed to continue their routine medication. Asthmatic patients had a comprehensive phenotypical and laboratory work-up. The latter included full pulmonary function tests; methacholine tests (if FEV 1 was >60% of predicted value); chest computed tomography (CT); FENO values; blood test results for eosinophils, total IgE levels, and IgE antibody levels (when appropriate); bronchoscopy with BAL; airway brushing; and endobronchial biopsy (see Fig E1, A, in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org).\n\nThe foregoing procedures were performed, as described previously. 25 BAL fluid was processed within an hour. Cells were isolated by means of centrifugation. Supernatant fluid was aliquoted into small samples and frozen at 2808C. Total BAL fluid cells and differential counts; a PCR-based respiratory viral panel (12 different respiratory viruses) with BAL cells and bronchial brushing; a PCR-based test for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae with airway biopsy specimens, brushings, and BAL cells; BAL culture in triplicates for bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and nontuberculous mycobacteria; and a quantitative analysis of airway tissue inflammatory cells, including CD117 1 mast cells (by using immunohistochemical staining) were performed in the National Jewish Health clinical laboratory (ADx-Advanced Diagnostic Lab, National Jewish Health).\n\nAliquots of BAL fluid and serum were analyzed for a total 244 biomolecules (Human Discovery MAP 2501, v2) by Myriad RBM (Austin, Tex). A list of the biomolecules analyzed by using this method is presented in Table E1 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org.\n\nWe performed pathway analyses for the 36 biomolecules that distinguished RA from NRA. We used multiple software at the Enrichnet.org Web site: Gene Ontology (GO) for biological process and molecular function, Reactome, and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.\n\nComparison between study groups was done with the Mann-Whitney U test. Comparison among multiple study groups was performed with the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by the Dunn test to correct for multiple comparisons. In addition, we performed the Benjamini-Hochberg test for multiple comparisons, which corrects for false discovery. The false discovery rate for this test was set at 0.1. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to calculate correlation coefficient. Statistical analyses were performed with Prism software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, Calif).\n\nWe recruited 20 healthy control subjects, 30 patients with well-controlled asthma, and 60 patients with RA, as defined by American Thoracic Society definitions. 26 The patients with NRA did not meet the criteria for RA because their asthma symptoms were well controlled by inhaled corticosteroids and other controllers. Thirty-six percent of patients with RA (22/60) were taking systemic steroids (10-60 mg/d). Asthmatic patients with a history of current or past smoking were excluded from the study. The demographic details of the study population are shown in Table I .\n\nHealthy control subjects and patients with NRA were younger than patients with RA (Table I) . Body mass index was not significantly different among the study groups. Patients with RA were more atopic (88%) than patients with NRA (66%) and healthy control subjects (55%), as judged by skin test positivity or the presence of IgE antibody against an environmental allergen. Pulmonary function indices (forced vital capacity\n\n[FVC] and FEV 1 ) were significantly lower and reversibility was significantly higher in patients with RA compared with those with NRA. There was no difference in PC 20 for methacholine between patients with RA and those with NRA. FENO values were not different among the 3 study groups. Blood eosinophil counts and total IgE levels were increased in asthmatic patients (both patients with RA and those with NRA) but were not different between patients with RA and those with NRA. Neither BAL fluid nor airway tissue eosinophil counts showed any significant difference between the NRA and RA groups. In contrast, BAL fluid and airway tissue neutrophil and BAL lymphocyte counts were increased in patients with RA. Surprisingly, numbers of tissue CD117 1 cells, which mostly represent mast cells, were decreased in patients with RA. Subepithelial basement membrane thickness, a sign of airway remodeling, was significantly increased in asthmatic patients, with the greatest thickness occurring in patients with RA.\n\nOf the 244 biomolecules assayed with the Human Discover-yMAPs v2 multiplex assay, 66 were less than the detection limit (see Fig E1, B) . One hundred one biomolecules did not show any significant difference among the study groups: healthy control subjects, patients with NRA, and patients with RA. Fifty-two biomolecules were significantly different either in multigroup comparisons or in comparisons between patients with RA and those with NRA (Table II) . Thirty-seven of these 52 biomolecules distinguished patients with RA from those with NRA (Table II and see Fig E1, C) . Because BAL fluid neutrophils were one of the cell types that distinguished patients with RA from those with NRA, we focused on neutrophil-associated biomolecules for this study. We identified 17 neutrophil-associated biomolecules with levels that were significantly increased in patients with RA when compared with those in patients with NRA and healthy control subjects (Table III) . Of these 17 biomolecules, 13 showed a significant positive correlation with the BAL fluid neutrophil count (Table IV) . Four biomolecules did not show any significant correlation. It is noteworthy that levels of only one of these 13 biomolecules, CCL3 (macrophage inflammatory protein 1b), correlated with BAL fluid eosinophil counts. We classified these biomolecules based on their published cellular sources (see Table E2 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). This classification suggests that innate immune and airway tissue cells are the primary source of RA-associated proneutrophilic biomolecules. This also implies that activation of innate immune and airway tissue cells contributes significantly to RA.\n\nOf the 244 biomolecules assayed, 29 were undetectable. One hundred seventy-two biomolecules did not show any difference among the study groups. Fourteen biomolecules were significantly different among all 3 study groups and also between patients with NRA and those with RA (Table V) . Of these 14 biomolecules, 6 of them were also detected in BAL fluid and were different among the study groups. They include ficolin 3, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 7, thrombospondin 1, apolipoprotein E, human epididymis protein 4, and neuropilin 1.\n\nNext, we examined the correlation of these serum biomolecules with BAL fluid inflammatory cells (see Table E3 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). Five biomolecules correlated with increased BAL fluid neutrophils: growth and . It should be noted that these infections were subclinical in nature because the patients did not report symptoms of acute infection (fever, coryza, pharyngitis, or myalgia). All patients had chest CT. A summary of chest CT findings from patients with positive results for infection is shown in Table E4 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline. org. One patient with Pseudomonas species had consolidation; 1 patient with Serratia marcescens had infiltrates, and 3 patients had ground-glass opacity. The rest of the patients did not have any sign of acute infection.\n\nNext, we examined the effect of infection on cellular and molecular parameters in patients with RA. As anticipated, infection increased the frequency of neutrophils more than that of eosinophils in the airways when compared with that seen in patients with NRA (see Fig E1, B) . This was associated with a dramatic increase in levels of the neutrophilic granular protein myeloperoxidase (see Fig E1, A) and a number of proneutrophilic biomolecules, especially MMP9, thrombospondin 1, IL-8, IL-1b, serum amyloid A (SAA), IL-6, lipocalin 2, neutrophil activating peptide-2 (NAP2), and 6 conserved cysteine containing CC-chemokine (see Fig E1, B) . Although the foregoing changes were statistically significant for the groups, not all infectionpositive patients with RA had increased BAL fluid neutrophil counts. Of the 24 infection-positive patients with RA, 15 had increased neutrophil frequencies (> _3%, threshold based on the normal range for the clinical laboratory) in BAL fluid, and 9 did not. Ten of these 15 infection-positive neutrophilic asthmatic patients had increased (> _1%) eosinophil frequencies in BAL fluid. Conversely, 4 of the 9 infection-positive but nonneutrophilic patients had increased eosinophil counts in BAL fluid.\n\nWe compared BAL fluid neutrophil frequencies (as a percentage) and absolute neutrophil counts in blood among infection-positive and infection-negative patients with RA and those with NRA. A total of 22 patients with RA (10 with infection-positive RA and 12 with infection-negative RA) were receiving systemic steroids, which could have a direct effect on blood and BAL fluid neutrophil counts. For this reason, we analyzed data with and without inclusion of patients receiving oral corticosteroids (OCSs). BAL fluid neutrophil counts were increased in both infection-positive and infection-negative patients with RA regardless of their OCS use compared with healthy control subjects (Fig 1, A) . Blood neutrophil counts were also increased in both infection-positive and infection-negative patients with RA when the data were analyzed for the entire group (Fig 1, B) . However, this increase was lost in the blood but not BAL fluid (Fig 1, C and D) in the infection-negative RA group when the patients receiving OCSs were excluded from analysis. The results suggest that blood neutrophilia in infection-negative patients with RA was caused by OCSs. Strikingly, the absolute neutrophil number remained increased in the infection-positive RA group, even when the patients receiving OCSs were excluded from the analysis. The results indicate that an increase in absolute neutrophil counts could serve as a blood biomarker for airway infection in patients with RA. The results also suggest that blood neutrophilia in this subgroup was due to airway infection (Fig 1, C) .\n\nAsthma is a type 2 immune response disease, and eosinophils play an important role. As noted earlier, the median BAL fluid eosinophil number did not increase significantly in patients with RA compared with those with NRA. Because infection contributed to RA in a significant number of patients, we reasoned that the former might have affected the eosinophilic influx by \n\nSubclinical infection was the most plausible explanation for increased airway neutrophil counts in our infection-positive patients with RA. The cause of neutrophilic asthma in infection-negative patients with RA was of major interest to us. To this goal, we compared serum proneutrophilic biomolecule levels between infection-negative and infection-positive patients with RA (Fig 2) . IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, and CCL3 levels were increased in serum from infection-negative patients with RA compared with those in infection-positive patients with RA and NRA. Interestingly, the BAL fluid concentrations of these molecules were not increased in the infection-negative patients with RA when compared with those in infection-positive patients with RA. The results raised the possibility of a systemic inflammatory process contributing to airway neutrophilia in infection-negative patients with RA.\n\nNext, we compared levels of C-reactive protein, soluble ST2 (serum stimulation 2, also known as suppressor of tumorigenicity 2), and GDF-15, 3 molecules associated with atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, and systemic inflammatory diseases. 27, 28 Indeed, levels of all 3 molecules were increased in infectionnegative but not infection-positive patients with neutrophilic asthma (Fig 3) . The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was similar in both groups. We were concerned about a potential role for inhaled corticosteroids in airway neutrophilia. To this goal, we compared inhaled corticosteroid treatment of patients with NRA and those with RA (see Table E5 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). All patients with RA were receiving high-dose inhaled steroids and long-acting b-agonists. In contrast, some patients with NRA were receiving low-to medium-dose inhaled steroids. Thus it is possible that this difference in the dose of inhaled steroids contributed to airway neutrophilia.\n\nNext, we examined the clinical correlation of airway inflammatory cells and biomolecules. There was a positive correlation (r 5 0.49, P < .001) between the age of the patient and the BAL PMN count. Age also positively correlated with FVC (r 5 0.52, P < .05) and BAL fluid IL-1b levels (r 5 0.67, P < .001) but not with levels of other proneutrophilic biomolecules, including IL-6 (r 5 0.40) and IL-8 (r 5 0.18). BAL fluid PMN counts but not BAL fluid eosinophil, lymphocyte, or blood eosinophil counts negatively correlated with FVC percentages (see Table E6 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). CD117 1 cells, which largely but not exclusively represent mast cells, did not correlate with levels of any BAL biomolecules. Levels of 2 BAL fluid biomolecules correlated with 2 pulmonary function indices. Myoglobin levels negatively correlated with FVC percentage, whereas prostasin levels negatively correlated with reversibility and positively with FEV 1 percentage. We performed pathway analyses with the 36 BAL fluid biomolecules that distinguished patients with RA from those with NRA. We compared pathway results by using GO for biological process and molecular function, Reactome, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (data not shown). The GO analysis identified the most meaningful pathways. The top pathways included neutrophil chemotaxis, chemokine receptor signaling, fibroblast growth factor stimulation, and cellular response to IL-1 (see Table E7 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). \n\nWe showed that RA was associated with an increase in neutrophil and lymphocyte counts in the airways. As mentioned previously, we specifically focused on neutrophilic asthma in this article. There was a concurrent increase in levels of a multitude of biomolecules known to be associated with innate immune and airway tissue responses. We identified 51 biomolecules with increased levels in asthmatic patients, and 36 of them distinguished RA from NRA. Sixteen biomolecules correlated with neutrophilic asthma. The vast majority of these biomolecules are known to be produced by macrophages and airway epithelial cells, which indirectly points to their role in patients with neutrophilic asthma. A pathway analysis identified neutrophilic influx as an important biological process in RA. Multiple previous studies demonstrated a similar role for neutrophilic inflammation in severe asthma. Our RA group resembles cluster 5 (neutrophilic) of the SARP cohort. 29 In a subsequent study of SARP patients, increased neutrophil and mixed neutrophil and eosinophil counts in the sputum (clusters C and D) were associated with asthma severity. 30 Our patients with RA are similar to those of cluster H (mixed neutrophilic/eosinophilic) of the multinational study by Hinks et al. 31 This cluster had severe asthma, which was associated with increased IL-6, IL-8, MMP3, and MMP8 levels in sputum.\n\nOne of the weaknesses of this study is that patients with RA were significantly older than patients with NRA. RA is more prevalent in older patients, 4,5 which led to this unintended recruitment outcome. Increased age is associated with sputum neutrophilia, even in nonasthmatic subjects. 32 Thus increased age could affect the quality and quantity of the mediators involved in neutrophilic asthma.\n\nWe used a commercially available multiplex assay service for measurement of biomolecules. Multiplex assays are less sensitive than other highly sensitive assays (eg, ELISA). This perhaps explains why we did not detect the typical type 2 (eg, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) or type 3 (IL-17) cytokines. However, the scope of biomolecules detected by using this assay is an advantage.\n\nOne outstanding issue related to the heightened production of proneutrophilic biomolecules is what induces their production in patients with RA. We observed subclinical infection (both bacterial and viral) in one third of the patients with RA. This subclinical infection could stimulate production of proneutrophilic biomolecules. We used standard microbiological cultures to detect bacteria. The sensitivity of these cultures is relatively low when compared with that of DNA-based technologies. It is possible that new technologies will identify additional patients with subclinical infections, which could explain increased airway neutrophil counts in the currently classified infection-negative patients.\n\nThe persistence of infection at a subclinical level in a subgroup of patients raises concerns for a defective immune response. This inability to clear infection could be primary or secondary to ongoing treatment with steroids (inhaled steroids in all patients and systemic steroids in 36% of patients with RA). The potential role of inhaled steroids in patients with subclinical infection cannot be addressed at this time because their discontinuation in patients with RA will be considered unethical.\n\nWe detected decreased IL-18 and IL-22 levels in patients with RA. Low IL-18 levels were previously reported in sputum from asthmatic patients and in patients during rhinovirus infection. 33, 34 IL-18 and IL-22 are important for defense against infection. 35, 36 Their decrease could impair clearance of infection. Macrophage scavenging of infected and dead cells is important for resolution of inflammation.\n\nAxl receptor tyrosine kinase is specifically expressed on airway macrophages. 37 We observed decreased expression of Axl receptor in BAL, which suggested a decreased expression on macrophages and, consequently, an impaired scavenger function. The latter could promote persistence of infection.\n\nThrombospondin 1 is a multifunctional and pleiotropic protein, levels of which are increased in patients with RA. It was recently reported to inhibit bactericidal activity of neutrophils and delay the clearance of lung infection. 38 Thus we have identified a number of biomolecules that could promote persistence of subclinical infection in patients with RA.\n\nSystemic glucocorticoids are known to induce blood and tissue neutrophilia. 39 Thirty-six percent of patients with RA were taking systemic steroids. Our analysis of patients who were not taking OCSs suggested that systemic steroids contributed to blood but not airway neutrophilia in infection-negative patients with RA. Our understanding of the role of inhaled steroids in patients with airway neutrophilia is incomplete. A previous study showed that systemic but not inhaled steroids were associated with tissue neutrophilia. 39 However, this study was done with a small number of patients, and the result showed a trend for increased airway neutrophil counts with inhaled steroids. Both patients with NRA and those with RA were receiving inhaled steroids in our study. However, unlike patients with RA, not all patients with NRA received maximal doses of inhaled steroids. Thus it is possible that higher doses of inhaled steroids in patients with RA contributed to some extent to airway neutrophilia. Environmental toxicants frequently induce cytokines/chemokines that can elicit low-level neutrophilic inflammation. 40 There could be a cumulative effect during aging. The T H 17 immune response induces neutrophilic inflammation in animal models. 16 Our assay did not detect IL-17, likely because of the low sensitivity of the assay. However, the assay detected increased levels of multiple proneutrophilic biomolecules, including SAA, NAP2, thrombospondin 1, IL-6, IL-8, C3, CCL3, CCL20, epidermal growth factor, and receptor for advanced glycosylation end products. All except the last 3 significantly correlated with BAL fluid neutrophil counts. SAA induces granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and stimulates neutrophil generation. 41 It also induces T H 17. 42 IL-6 is an inducer of T H 17 43 and a marker of systemic inflammation. 44 NAP2, IL-8, C3, and CCL3 directly induce neutrophilic inflammation. [45] [46] [47] [48] C3 also induces IL-1, IL-8, and other cytokines/chemokines, which could indirectly affect neutrophilic inflammation. 48 Some of our findings on biomolecules are in agreement with those of many previous studies. Similar to our finding, IL-1b and IL-6 discriminated severe from moderate asthma in a SARP study. 25 IL-8 levels have previously been reported to be increased in sputum 49, 50 and BAL fluid 51 from patients with RA and neutrophilic asthma.\n\nAlthough the existence of neutrophilic asthma in the absence of infection has been known for many years, its mechanism is poorly understood. Our study identified a unique subgroup of infection-negative patients with neutrophilic RA, which was selectively associated with increased markers of inflammation in serum. These markers included IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, and CCL3. The concomitant increase in C-reactive protein levels in the same patients suggested a systemic inflammatory process akin to what has been observed in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular 52 and autoinflammatory 53 diseases. Remarkably, this subgroup of patients also had increases in 2 additional cardiovascular risk factors: GDF-15 54 and soluble ST2 (IL-33 receptor). 52 We recognize that the latter is a nonspecific biomarker of systemic inflammation. Four (11%) of 36 (11%) infection-negative patients with neutrophilic RA and 5 (21%) of 24 infection-positive patients with neutrophilic RA had a history of cardiovascular disease. Therefore the frequency of existing cardiovascular disease did not explain the systemic (serum) increase in levels of these inflammatory cytokines. We also did not find any correlation of these inflammatory cytokines with other common comorbidities: diabetes and autoimmune disorders.\n\nThere are multiple known mechanisms for induction of IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, and CCL3. This constellation of inflammatory cytokines also constitutes the senescenceassociated secretory product. 55 Senescence is a biological process that defends against DNA damage-induced carcinogenesis but, by producing multiple cytokines, contributes to systemic inflammation. 56 Recently, GDF-15 has been shown to induce cellular senescence. 57 The correlation of neutrophilic asthma with age also raises the possibility that senescence contributed to the increased proneutrophilic cytokine profile in the serum. Additional studies will be needed to establish the relationship between cellular senescence and predisposition to neutrophilic RA.\n\nIt should be noted that 37% of infection-positive patients with RA did not have neutrophilia in BAL fluid, which further underscores the notion that this was a subclinical infection. Nearly half of them had increased eosinophil counts in BAL fluid, suggesting type 2 immunodominant asthma. Type 2 cytokines inhibit IL-8 and other proneutrophilic cytokines, 58 which could explain the lack of neutrophilia. However, the absence of neutrophilia in noneosinophilic infection-positive patients with RA suggests a defective immune response or perhaps an active immune evasion by the microbial organism.\n\nOf the 14 serum biomolecules that were different among the study groups, only 5 biomolecules overlapped with those from the BAL fluid. However, the pattern of change was different from that in BAL fluid. Four of these biomolecules showed reduced expression in patients with NRA but not in those with RA when compared with expression in healthy control subjects. The reason for this reduced expression in patients with NRA but not those with RA is not clear. Ficolin 3 is the only biomolecule in the serum that distinguished RA from NRA. Ficolin 3 is a recognition molecule of the lectin pathway of the complement system. Its deficiency is associated with increased infection. 59 If subclinical infection is one of the mechanisms of RA in a subgroup of patients, its importance can be tested through targeted and bacterial strain-specific antibiotic therapy. We are aware that antibiotic therapy of patients with RA produced mixed results in the past. 60, 61 The failure of antibiotic therapy in some studies could be due to inappropriate selection of study patients (eg, inclusion of patients who did not have any infection) and use of an inappropriate antibiotic. 3 Note that we detected both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, as well as viruses, in patients with RA. The results underscore the importance of the selection of an appropriate antibiotic (targeting gram-positive vs gram-negative bacteria) and its application to a properly identified target patient population. If low-level systemic inflammation is indeed the cause of airway neutrophilia in infection-negative patients with RA, this hypothesis can be tested by using therapeutic agents targeting molecules, such as IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8. Some of these therapeutic agents are already in use in patients with rheumatologic conditions. The number of CD117 1 cells representing mostly mast cells was reduced in patients with RA. Reduced numbers of tryptase-positive cells representing mast cells in patients with severe asthma was previously reported in a SARP study. 62 This was thought to be due to the loss of tryptase as a consequence of mast cell degranulation. However, unlike tryptase, CD117 is a cell-surface marker and not a granular protein and is not expected to be affected by mast cell degranulation. It is possible that the reduced CD117 1 cell number is a consequence of the underlying disease process.\n\nWe acknowledge the excellent technical assistance of Christena Kolakowski and Allen Stevens.\n\nClinical implications: This study identifies airway neutrophils and proneutrophilic biomolecules as significant contributors to RA. A subgroup of neutrophilic asthma was associated with a subclinical infection. This group is likely to benefit from specific antimicrobial therapy. Neutrophilic asthma without a subclinical infection showed signs of systemic inflammation. Therapies targeting proneutrophilic biomolecules, autoinflammation, or both are likely to control asthma in this subgroup. Least detectable dose (LDD) was determined as the mean 1 3 SDs of 20 blank readings. Results less than the LDD will be more variable than results greater than the LDD. Lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was the lowest concentration of an analyte in a sample that can be reliably detected and at which the total error meets the laboratory's requirements for accuracy. Myriad RBM's requirement for accuracy is the concentration of an analyte at which the coefficient of variation of replicate standard samples is 30%.
