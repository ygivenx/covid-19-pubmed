{"title": "In the era of corona virus: health care professionals\u2019 knowledge, attitudes, and practice of hand hygiene in Saudi primary care centers: a cross-sectional study", "body": "Verbal consent was obtained from all subjects before they participated in the study. To keep their confidentiality, the returned questionnaires were kept anonymous and an identification code was assigned to each questionnaire in order to send a reminder to those who did not return the questionnaire. Participant details were kept in a password-protected computer that was accessible only to the researchers. Additionally, Institutional Review Board of King Abdullah International Medical Research Centre (KAIMRC) approved the project and ensured proper ethical conduct throughout the study.\n\nIn the knowledge section of the questionnaire, the minimum knowledge score achieved was 5 and the maximum was 21 (Fig. 1), with a mean of 14 (SD\u00b12.85). Nurses scored higher (14.1) than physicians (13.8) on knowledge scale; however, this was not statistically significant (p = 0.58). Moreover, the participants who received hand hygiene training within the last 3 years generally scored higher on knowledge scale (14.2) than those who did not have such a training (13.5); nevertheless, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.09). Knowledge score was not affected by the years of the participants\u2019 work experience (p = 0.4). Those who reported using the alcohol-based hand rub routinely had significantly higher knowledge score (14.3) than those who did not use the hand rub routinely (12.5) (p=0.01)\n\nIn the attitude section of the questionnaire, only 218 (92%) participants completed the questions. Generally, there was an overall positive attitude from participants toward hand hygiene practice (Fig. 2). Participants agreed fully that hand hygiene is important, possible, and not time consuming; believed it saves lives; and would feel bad if they were not able to wash their hands. However, half the participants believed that their attention to proper hand hygiene practices is negatively affected by their workload.\n\nAttitude toward hand hygiene was not correlated with the participants\u2019 gender, years of experience, or training. However, nurses were found to exhibit a better attitude toward hand hygiene than physicians (p=0.02). Also, age was positively correlated with a positive attitude toward hand hygiene (Spearman's rho = 0.14, p=0.04)\n\nIn the practice section of the questionnaire, 81.9% (194) acknowledged that they routinely make use of alcohol-based hand rub, 86.5% (205) had sufficiently decontaminated hands even under high work pressure, and 77.6% (184) addressed that their hand hygiene practice was not affected by less compliant colleagues. Also, 55.3% (131) confirmed that their hand hygiene practice would improve if skin moisturizers were made available to them.\n\n\nThere was no correlation between the frequency of practicing hand hygiene and the participants\u2019 gender, age, and years of experience. However, there was a significant correlation between such practices and participants\u2019 training in hand hygiene in the last 3 years (p=0.02). Also, nurses were found to be more compliant with using alcohol-based hand rub than physicians (p=0.03).\n\nThere was a significant correlation between the level of practicing hand rubbing with alcohol and higher score of knowledge (p\u22640.01). Also those who stated that their practice was not affected by workload were found to have a significantly higher knowledge score (p\u22640.01). Participants who stated they were able to resist peer pressure had slightly higher mean knowledge score, but the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.7). Moreover, those whose practice was affected by the availability of skin moisturizers scored significantly lower on attitude score (p\u22640.01).\n\nAlthough the English language is the official language of communication in the work environment in KAMC, English is a second language to most HCWs, and this might affect how participants responded to the survey tool. We did not identify any language barriers during the pilot testing of the data collection tool.\n\nWe conclude with a suggestion for innovation by instructing patients to remind HCWs to perform hand hygiene, which proved to have a positive effect on HCWs\u2019 compliance with hand hygiene practice (28). However, a disadvantage of this strategy was that a substantial number of patients reported reluctance or uneasiness in reminding health care professionals. Such approaches should be tested and evidence of their effectiveness in various health care settings must be also explored in further research in order to be implemented to enhance the KAP of hand hygiene among HCWs."}
