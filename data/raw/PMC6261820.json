{"title": "p53- and ROS-mediated AIF pathway involved in TGEV-induced apoptosis", "body": "PK-15 cells were cultured in Dulbecco Minimal Essential Medium (DMEM) with 10% heat-inactivated newborn bovine serum (Gibco BRL, Now York, MD, U.S.A.), at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5%\nCO2 chamber. The TGEV was used as previously described by Ding et al. [7]. Primary antibodies against AIF (sc-13116),\n\u03b2-actin (sc-69879), Cox4 (sc-376731), p53 (sc-4246), PARP-1 (sc-8007), and histone H3 (sc-517576) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, Delaware, CA, U.S.A.). The\nantibody against TGEV N protein was prepared by our laboratory. Fluorescein Isothiocyanate (FITC), Rhodamine and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from\nThe Thermo Scientific Pierce (Pierce, Rockford, IL, U.S.A.). N-phenylmaleimide (NP) and pi\ufb01thrin-\u03b1 (PFT-\u03b1) were purchased from Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich, Burlington, MA, U.S.A.). Z-VAD-FMK and\nVeliparib (ABT-888) were purchased from MedChemExpress (MedChemExpress, Monmouth Junction, NJ, U.S.A.). Pyrrolidinedithiocarbamic (PDTC) was purchased from Merck (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt,\nGermany).\n\nCells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Then the cells were incubated with a primary antibody against AIF (1:100) or TGEV N at\n4\u00b0C overnight after blocked with 5% serum albumin for 30 min. Samples were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Subsequently, secondary antibody (Rhodamine-conjugated\nIgG) was incubated for 1 hr in the dark. Then, 4\u2019, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were used to counterstain cell nuclei for 10 min. Images were taken under a fluorescence microscope (AMG\nEVOS, Hatfield, PA, U.S.A.).\n\nRNA extraction and qRT-PCR were performed as our previously described [7]. Specific primers that were used are as follows: AIF sense,\nTGTGGAACGTCTTCAACCGA; AIF antisense, AGAGGAAGGCTGCGCAATAA. Actin sense GGACTTCGAGCAGGAGATGG; actin antisense: AGGAAGGAGGGCTGGAAGAG.\n\nThe mitochondrial and nuclear proteins were isolated as the description of the Mitochondria Fractionation Kit and the CelLytic\u2122 NuCLEAR\u2122 Extraction Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Burlington, MA,\nU.S.A.), respectively. Protein concentrations were measured using the BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL, U.S.A.). The Western blot assay was conducted as we described\npreviously [7].\n\nThe detection of apoptosis was performed as described by Ding et al [8]. Summarily, harvested cells were washed with PBS for three\ntimes and then resuspended in 500 \u00b5l binding buffer, followed by the addition of 5 \u00b5l of Annexin V-FITC and 5 \u00b5l of PI. After incubation\nfor 30 min at room temperature, a total of 10,000 cells were examined. The positive cells was analyzed by flow cytometry using Beckman CytoFLEX FCM (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, U.S.A.).\n\nThe CRISPR/Cas9 system (Genome Engineering. Broad Institute Cambridge, MA, U.S.A.) was used to mutate p53 gene, according to the description by Xu et al [29]. Briefly, annealed fragments of gRNA (F: AGTCACGAACTGGCTGGATG, R: TCAGTGGCTTGACCGACCTAC) were cloned into lentiCRISPRv2 plasmid (Addgene, Cambridge,\nMA, U.S.A.), then with the psPAX2 packaging plasmid co-transfected into HEK293T cells to generate the lentivirus. Lentiviral titers were measured by qPCR. Lentiviral-infected PK15 cell lines\ngrown in puromycin DMEM medium were used for selecting p53 knockout cells. Puromycin-resistant PK15 cells were selected and amplified and were subsequently examined by Western blot.\n\nOur previous study demonstrated that caspase inhibitors did not completely prevent apoptosis in TGEV-infected cells [7]. Thus, to investigate whether\nAIF pathway was activated in TGEV-induced apoptosis in PK-15 cells, the protein levels of AIF in mitochondrial and nuclear fractions were measured by Western blot. Results showed that the\nmitochondrial fraction levels of AIF decreased significantly after 24 hr of infection with TGEV, while the nuclear fraction of AIF increased after 24 hr post infection, and keep rising with\ninfection time (Fig. 1A).\n\nTo further confirm AIF translocation to the nucleus during TGEV infection, immunofluorescence was performed with an antibody against AIF (red fluorescence). As predicted, AIF translocated\nto the nucleus after TGEV infection (Fig. 1B), suggesting that AIF was activated in TGEV-infected PK-15 cells. In addition, to confirm the AIF\nactivation was induced by TGEV infection, we measured the TGEV N protein levels by immunofluorescence and Western blot assays. Results showed that TGEV N protein were observed in\nTGEV-infected PK15 cells (Fig. 1C and 1D).\n\nTo verify whether AIF activation was involved in TGEV-induced apoptosis, the AIF inhibitor, NP, was used to co-treat PK-15 cells with TGEV, and the apoptotic rate was measured. Our results\nshowed that NP partly abrogated TGEV-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that AIF pathway might be involved in TGEV-induced\napoptosis.\n\nPrevious studies demonstrated that Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) contributed to the release of AIF from the mitochondria to nucleus, activating the AIF apoptotic pathway [11]. Our previous research showed that TGEV infection induced PARP-1 activation and subsequent cleavage [7]. To\ndetermine whether the translocation of AIF was mediated by PARP-1 during TGEV-induced apoptosis, the PARP-1 inhibitor, ABT-888, was used to co-treat PK-15 cells with TGEV. Western blot assay\nwas used to measure the AIF protein levels in the nucleus. As shown in Fig. 2A, ABT-888 markedly inhibited the total protein and cleaved protein levels of PARP-1, compared with TGEV infection alone, however the total protein levels of PARP-1 were no significant\ndifference in ABT-888- and TGEV- co-treated PK-15 cells, compared with ABT-888 treatment alone. Moreover, ABT-888 significantly inhibited the activation of PARP-1 and the AIF translocation\nwas prevented by ABT-888 (Fig. 2B). These results indicated that PARP-1 may be crucial in the AIF translocation during TGEV infection.\n\nVirus infection could induce ROS accumulation [8, 24], and excessive ROS could change mitochondrial permeability\ntransition pore (mPTP) and activate PARP-1, thereby leading to AIF translocation into the nucleus [17, 28]. Our\nprevious work revealed that ROS is an important early mediator in TGEV-induced apoptosis [8]. To further explore the roles of ROS accumulation in the\nAIF-mediated apoptotic pathway during TGEV infection, we investigated the effects of PDTC, an ROS scavenger, on the cleavage of PARP-1 and AIF translation. As predicted, PDTC significantly\nattenuated the cleavage of PARP-1 (Fig. 3A), as evidenced by the redistribution of AIF in the mitochondria and nucleus in PK-15 cells infected by TGEV (Fig. 3B). The result indicated\nthat ROS may play a vital role in TGEV-induced AIF activation.\n\nOur previous research showed that TGEV infection can activate ROS/p53- mediated apoptotic pathways [8]. In addition, several lines of research showed\nthat AIF could be regulated by p53 [25, 31]. We therefore sought to whether p53 regulated the AIF expression. To\nthat end, we used the p53 inhibitor, PFT-\u03b1, to co-treat the cells with TGEV and analyzed the AIF mRNA levels. Result showed that the mRNA levels of AIF decreased in the presence of PFT-\u03b1\ncompared to those without PFT-\u03b1 (Fig. 4A). To further explore the effect of p53 on AIF translocation, the AIF protein levels in the mitochondria and the nucleus were detected by Western blot. Our results showed that PFT-\u03b1\ntreatment significantly reduced AIF protein levels in the nucleus (Fig. 4B), suggesting that p53 may be involved in AIF activation upon TGEV\ninfection.\n\nTo rule out the contribution of the PFT-\u03b1 inhibitor on the virus, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to mutate the p53 gene. Result showed that the p53 protein was completely eliminated by the\ngRNA-generated clone (Fig. 4C). Next, the wild-type PK15 cells (WT) and the PK15 p53 knockout cells (PK15p53\u2212/\u2212) were infected with TGEV,\nand the activation of AIF was detected by qPCR and Western blot. As shown in Fig. 4D and 4E, AIF mRNA expression and the translocation of AIF were\nreduced markedly in the absence of p53. The findings were consistent with the changes associated with PFT-\u03b1 treatment.\n\nTo further confirm that TGEV infection activated both caspase-dependent pathway and AIF pathway, we combined these inhibitors to treat the cells, and then measured the apoptotic rate upon\nTGEV infection. Result showed that TGEV-induced apoptosis was almost completely inhibited by combination of pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK and AIF inhibitor NP treatment, compared to TGEV\ninfection alone. The same blocking were also observed when the cells were treated by combination of three or more inhibitors, such as Z-VAD-FMK, NP, ABT-888, ROS scavenger PDTC, p53\ninhibitor PFT-\u03b1 (Fig. 5). The result is further evidence that caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathway were included in TGEV-induced apoptosis, and, p53 and ROS played vital roles during apoptosis\nprocess.\n\nAIF can participate in apoptosis upon translocation to the nucleus [4, 5, 14]. It binds to DNA in the nucleus, and induces chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation by recruiting downstream nucleases, resulting in apoptosis [11]. Actually, AIF is considered to play a centric role in regulating caspase-independent pathways in cells [4, 6]. Our present study showed that TGEV infection activated AIF, which was released to the nucleus, thereby resulting in apoptosis. Combination the inhibitors of pan caspase\nand AIF blocked the apoptosis. In agreement with our previous research [7], we demonstrated that TGEV-induced apoptosis involved a caspase-independent\npathway as well as caspase-dependent pathways in infected cells. Similar findings were seen with the rabies virus and the vesicular stomatitis virus [10,\n20].\n\nSeveral researches indicated that PARP-1 can induce poly (ADP-ribosyl) ation translocation to the mitochondria, then triggering AIF translocation to the nucleus, resulting in DNA\nfragmentation, to activate the AIF apoptotic pathway [11, 28], Consistent with these results, the current study\nshowed that PARP-1 inhibition could reduce the redistribution of AIF in the mitochondria and nucleus, suggesting that PARP-1 may be a prerequisite for TGEV-induced translocation of AIF.\nHowever, the total protein levels of PARP-1 were no significant difference in ABT-888 and TGEV co-treated PK-15 cells, compared with ABT-888 treatment alone, but remarkably decreased when\ncompared to that TGEV infection alone. And also the cleaved PARP-1 were not absolutely inhibited in TGEV-infected cells. These results suggest that TGEV might activate PARP-1 to induce AIF\ntranslocation, while the cleavage of PARP-1 was partly promoted by caspases.\n\nIn multiple signaling pathways, ROS is believed to be a second messenger [23]. Many studies have shown that high levels of ROS can change the\nmitochondrial permeability transition pores (mPTPs) and activate PARP-1, leading to AIF translocation to the nucleus [18, 21]. We previously demonstrated that TGEV-induced ROS accumulation reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, leading to apoptosis [8]. In the\npresent study, we show that the inhibition of ROS by PDTC attenuated the translocation of AIF, indicating that ROS may be an important factor in a caspase-independent cell apoptosis pathway\nduring TGEV infection.\n\nThe accumulation of ROS may initiate cellular safeguard machinery p53 [15]. The signal would be returned to the mitochondria, leading to the increase of\nmitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, subsequently the release of pro-apoptotic factors, thus triggering the apoptosis cascade [15]. p53 not\nonly takes effects on caspase-dependent apoptosis [2, 22], but also drives the efficient activation of AIF through\nregulating AIF gene expression, to mediate a caspase-independent death pathway [25]. In the current study, the p53 inhibitor, PFT-\u03b1, significantly\nreduced the mRNA levels of AIF and decreased the protein levels in the nucleus, and the similar results were also found in TGEV-infected p53\u2212/\u2212 cells. These results showed that p53 might\nmediate the transcription of AIF, and induce AIF translocation to the nucleus.\n\nIn the present study, we elaborated that TGEV infection induced AIF translocation to the nucleus, which may be mediated by p53 activation and ROS accumulation. These results provided further\ninsight into the mechanism of TGEV-induced cell death."}
