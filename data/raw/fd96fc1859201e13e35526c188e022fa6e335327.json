{"title": "Transmission of corona virus disease 2019 during the incubation period may lead to a quarantine loophole", "body": "The corona virus disease has spread rapidly throughout China and poses an increasing threat to globe health. 1 The disease is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which was first discovered in the epidemic center of Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019. 2 Although China has taken unprecedented actions to halt the outbreak (e.g. lockdown of Wuhan), the reported case numbers are still rising exponentially, particularly in Wuhan. As of February 17, 2020, a total of 72436 COVID-19 cases were officially confirmed in mainland China, 3 and 42752 of which come from Wuhan. 4 The rapidly increasing number of cases in Wuhan promotes people to concern whether there are infected cases not identified or quarantined in time.\n\nThe prior outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which were caused by corona virus, were reported to be rarely transmitted during the asymptomatic incubation period. [5] [6] [7] An urgent question that scientists are racing to learn is whether an asymptomatic COVID-19 case during the incubation period can infect others. 8 Another major unanswered question is when these asymptomatic cases in the incubation period can infect others, and whether individuals in contact with the COVID-19 cases before the symptom onset should be isolated and provided with medical observation. Until now, only one article reported transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection from an asymptomatic case in the incubation period in Germany. 9 One article from Germany found SARS-CoV-2 in a throat swab in two asymptomatic cases, 10 and the other article from China suggested the transmission by an asymptomatic carrier of SARS-CoV-2 in a familial cluster of five COVID-19 patients. 11 Compared with the relative small number of asymptomatic cases, the majority of COVID-19 cases when they have no symptoms in their .

If the asymptomatic transmission during the incubation period contributes to a significant number of infection cases, a loophole of quarantine will ensue.\n\nIn the present study, we aimed to examine whether and when the COVID-19 cases during their incubation period infect others, in order to offer clues to containment measures to mitigate the spread of infection.\n\nAccurate estimation of the incubation period is essential to clarify whether the cases who are in the incubation period are a potential source of infection. The exposure time of the majority cases in Wuhan is ambiguous and therefore cannot be used to estimate the incubation period. By examining the cases who were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 after a short visit to Wuhan or having a short contact history with a confirmed case, the incubation period could be accurately estimated based on their precise exposure time. Moreover, identification of people in households or communities who had contacted with a confirmed COVID-19 case before symptom onset could help to evaluate the potential transmission during the incubation period.\n\nWe collected the data of confirmed COVID-19 cases outside Wuhan city and Hubei province in China from local officials in China. The information included demographic characteristics, exposure or contact history, time of exposure and .

Data were entered into a database, and verified by two independent authors. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion and consensus.\n\nIn order to increase the accuracy of the incubation period estimation, the selected cases were limited to those with an accurate exposure period of no more than three days. In addition, we only selected the cases who had symptom onset before Chinese Spring Festival (January 25, 2020) to reduce the bias of exposure time, since the custom of visiting relatives and friends in Spring Festival may result to the increase of people's contact and exposure to unknown infectious source. The cases for estimation of the incubation period were harvested according to the criteria as follows: having a short travel history to Wuhan or having a contact history with a confirmed case, and having no other potential source of infection; and their stay duration or contact exposure was no more than three days, and the information on the dates of their exposure and symptom onset was available. Finally, 106 cases were included in for the analysis of incubation period.\n\nThe data of family or community clustered COVID-19 cases throughout February 16, 2020 were used to assess the potential of transmission during the asymptomatic incubation period. We defined the first-generation cases in a cluster as those who had a travel history to Wuhan, or had a contact history (contact with the people from Wuhan, or confirmed cases, or persons with respiratory symptoms), and had been confirmed to have infection of SARS-CoV-2. The secondary cases were defined as those who had a clear contact history to the first-generation cases, and had been confirmed to have infection of SARS-CoV-2, but had no other potential infection source. Cases in the clusters met the criteria as follows: the secondary cases had a close-contact history with their first-generation cases prior to symptom onset, and the .

A total of 50 first-generation cases and 74 secondary cases in 50 clusters were included for the analysis.\n\nWe described the demographic characteristics and exposures of the cases, and defined the incubation period as the exposure to the transmission source to the onset of symptoms. As each individual's incubation period was a typically time-to-event, we used a Weibull distribution-based survival analysis model with the extension of Kaplan-Meier estimator to fit the curve of the incubation period for COVID-19\n\ncases. 13, 14 The 95% confidence intervals for the mean and the percentiles of the incubation period were estimated by a bootstrapping method with resampling of 10,000 times. 15 The serial interval was defined as the time from symptom onset in the first-generation case to symptom onset in the secondary case. The back-projection method was used to estimate the infectious curve for the secondary cases of the clusters to further investigate the possibility of transmission during the incubation period. 16 Since the symptom onset date of the first-generation cases in different clusters were different, we centralized the symptom onset dates of all first-generation cases into a specific date, and the symptom onset dates of secondary cases were transformed accordingly. After the transformation, the infectious curve would indicate the number of secondary cases emerging before or after the symptom onset dates of the first-generation cases. We defined the back-projection equation as follows: All analyses were performed in R 3.1 (\"surveillance\" and \"survival\" packages) and SAS 9.4.\n\nThe data of the confirmed cases were from publicly reported, and this study as thus considered exempt from institutional review board approval.\n\nOf the 106 confirmed COVID-19 cases with a clear travel or contact history, the median age was 41 years (range, 19 to 73), and 70 (66.0%) were known to be male ( Table 1 ). The majority (82.1%) had an exposure period of 1-2 days, and 67.9% had a short travel history to Wuhan city. We estimated the mean incubation period to be 4.9\n\ndays (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.4 to 5.4) days, ranging from 0.8 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile) (Fig. 1 ).\n\nAmong the 50 clusters infected with SARS-CoV-2, the median age of the first-generation cases was 47 years (range, 21 to 73), and 58.0% were male, and 82.0% had a travel history to Wuhan ( Table 2 ). The median age of the 74 secondary cases was 45 years (range 7-83), and 45.9% were male. As the timelines shown in Figure 2 , most of the secondary cases (89.2%) had symptom onset after their first-generation cases, while four secondary cases (5.4%; in cluster 5, 21, 29, and 46) had symptom onset before their first-generation ones, and four pairs of first-generation and .

The observed mean and standard deviation (SD) of serial interval was 4.1\u00b13.3 days, with the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles at -1 and 13 days (Fig .2) .\n\nAfter the symptom onset dates of the first-generation cases were centralized, the peak of the infectious curve of the secondary cases was shown locating before the symptom onset dates of the first-generation cases (Fig. 3A) . The majority of the secondary cases (73.0%) were infected before the symptom onset of the first-generation cases, while 18.9% and 8.1% were infected on and after the date of the symptom onset of the first-generation cases, respectively (Fig. 3B) . Particularly, 66.2% of the secondary cases were infected within three days before the symptom onset dates of the first-generation cases.\n\nOur study initially demonstrated asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 in the incubation period, especially in the last three days of incubation period, by estimating the incubation period with the use of accurate exposure history of confirmed cases.\n\nAmong the clusters, we found that four secondary cases had symptom onset earlier than their first-generation cases, which further provides the evidence of the transmission during the incubation period. Our findings could help the officials to take strong and effective measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 and to the prediction of the epidemic trend.\n\nWe estimated the mean incubation period of COVID-19 infections to be 4.9 days, which was calculated based on a big sample size with valid data. Most importantly, the exposure time interval of the 106 cases selected in our study was no more than three days, and 82.1% of the cases had an exposure time of 1-2 days, which enabled .

Li et al. 17 reported that the incubation period of the new coronavirus was 5.2 days (95% CI, 4.1 to 7.0) with the 95th percentile at 12.5 days according to the early cases with illness onset exposed to the Huanan seafood wholesale market. The authors deemed that this estimation was somewhat imprecise because it was based on the information of only 10 cases. 17 Backer et al. 14 included cases ranged from one day to more than two weeks, and more than 75% of the cases in the two studies had the exposure time more than three days, which might induce bias in the estimates and cause the estimated incubation period longer than the actual length. In addition, our estimates of incubation period were consistent with the results reported by Guan et al. 19 that they estimated the mean incubation period less than five days from the data of 1099 confirmed patients in mainland China.\n\nWe observed the mean serial interval was 4.1 days for COVID-19, which is shorter than the 8.4-day and the 7.6-day mean serial interval reported for SARS and MERS, respectively. 5,20 More importantly, the serial interval is shorter than the estimates of the mean incubation period (4.9 days), suggesting that a proportion of secondary transmission may occur before symptom onset of the first-generation cases. Li et al. 17 estimated the mean serial interval at 7.5 days based on the cases reported in Wuhan city early in the epidemic (mostly in December 2019). However, there were only six pairs first-generation and secondary cases in this study, and the small sampling bias may have been introduced to the variance and mean. Our observed serial interval has been consistently demonstrated by a recent study that the estimated mean serial interval was 4.2 days based on 20 pairs of first-generation and secondary cases. 21 .

Our results indicated that the current quarantine measures have loopholes, which may lead to some asymptomatic cases during the incubation period slipping through the net.

Therefore, we believe more effective measures should be taken to stem the transmission of asymptomatic contact during the incubation period. Once a case is confirmed, it is imperative to trace back all the close contacts within at least three days prior to the symptom onset, and then quarantine these close contacts. If a patient has extensive social activities before the symptom onset, the risk of transmission will be greatly increased. Therefore, restricting social activities and restricting travel in and out of the cities in severe epidemic areas may effectively reduce the transmission.\n\nAll the information about the cases in this study comes from the data released by local authorities, and the cases were screened for analysis by using the same criteria.\n\nThe information of the cases released by local authorities outside of Hubei province, including the exposure history, was relatively complete and reliable, because less cases were reported outside of Hubei province and staffs working at local center of disease control (CDC) staffs had enough time to interview the cases as soon as possible. Therefore, this study provides a reliable incubation period and a strong evidence of the COVID-19 transmission during the incubation period.\n\nNevertheless, there are some limitations in this study. The data about virus detection were not available for those asymptomatic persons in their incubation period.\n\nSince the follow-up quantitative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (qRT-PCR) of virus nucleic acid assay was not available for most close contacts currently in China, it is difficult to obtain evidence of molecular biological monitoring in a short time. If qRT-PCR assays are performed for a group of close contacts, more convincing evidence will be provided for transmission of COVID-19 during the .

It is imperative to trace back the close contacts of confirmed cases before the symptom onset and avoid the quarantine loopholes. \n\nAll authors declare no competing interests. .
