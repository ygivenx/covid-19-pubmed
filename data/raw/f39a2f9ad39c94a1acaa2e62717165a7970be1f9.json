{"title": "A molecular cell atlas of the human lung from single cell RNA sequencing", "body": "Over the past two centuries, hundreds of human cell types have been discovered, categorized, and studied by microscopy, creating the classical atlases that provide the cellular foundation for modern medicine [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . In the past several decades, cell-type-specific marker genes have been identified that supplement the histological descriptions and provide molecular definitions and functions of the cell types [6] [7] [8] [9] . This reached its apex in the systematic profiling studies that elucidate genome-wide expression profiles of purified cell populations and, more recently, of individual cells by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] .\n\nAlthough initial scRNAseq studies focused on specific cell types, tissue compartments, and biological processes, large scale molecular cell atlases of organs and even whole organisms are now possible because of improvements in throughput and cost that allow expression profiling of thousands of individual cells, without cell purification or prior knowledge of cell identity to obtain expression profiles of at least the most abundant and easy to isolate cell types [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Perhaps the greatest current challenge is obtaining profiles of rare and fragile cell types, or even just assessing the \"completeness\" of a molecular cell atlas. Indeed, most scRNAseq efforts to date have left the identities and tissue locations of many transcriptionally-distinct cell populations We set out to create a comprehensive molecular cell atlas of the adult human lung, both for its basic science value and potential clinical applications since pulmonary diseases and All rights reserved.

This is a substantial technical challenge because the lung is comprised of 45 histologically-defined cell types with diverse structures and functions that vary in abundance over five orders of magnitude 30 (Table S1 ). Here we describe a systematic single cell RNA sequencing approach toward capturing, annotating, and analyzing the expression profiles of all lung cell types. We do so by using fresh blood and lung tissue obtained intraoperatively, balancing the abundance across the major tissue compartments of the 75,000 cells analyzed, employing both broad cell capture (droplet-based) and deep expression (plate-based) scRNAseq profiling strategies, and using the distinguishing molecular features along with ascertained spatial information of the novel and ambiguous cell clusters to assign cellular identities. We identify 41 of 45 previously known lung cell types and subtypes including all but the exceedingly rare ones, plus 14 new ones. We show how this comprehensive lung cell atlas provides novel insights into the functions, regulation, and interactions of the known as well as the new cell types; into which cell types are targeted in disease and how each type can be specified in development and tissue engineering; and into organ evolution by revealing lung cell types that have been gained, lost, and altered from mouse to human. The atlas provides a benchmark for analysis of diseased lung tissue, and the approach can be readily applied to other organs to create a human molecular cell atlas.\n\nAll rights reserved.

We acquired histologically normal lung tissue samples intraoperatively from bronchi (proximal), bronchiole (medial), and alveolar (distal) regions (Fig. S1 ) along with samples of peripheral blood and immediately began processing (Fig. 1a) . Lung samples were independently dissociated into single cell suspensions, and each lung cell suspension was then separated into epithelial (EPCAM + ), endothelial/immune (CD31 + /CD45 + ) and stromal (EPCAM -, CD31 -/CD45 -) populations by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or magnetic-assisted cell sorting (MACS) (Fig. S2a ). This allowed us to balance compartmental representation for sequencing, which for lung is otherwise dominated by immune and endothelial cells. Index sorting further provided surface antigen levels and other cell parameters for the FACS-sorted cells. Some of the blood cells were also index sorted by FACS to balance representation of the major immune cell lineages (Figs. 1a, S2b). Sequencing libraries were prepared from MACS-sorted lung cell populations and unsorted blood cells using dropletbased 10x Chromium (10x) protocol, or from FACS-sorted individual lung and blood cells using SmartSeq2 (SS2) protocol 31 . The higher cell throughput and lower cost of 10x enabled discovery of rare cell types, whereas SS2 gave deeper transcriptomic information that aided cell classification and detection of genes expressed at low levels such as transcription factor and receptor genes. There were also platform-specific idiosyncrasies; for example alveolar macrophages were the most abundant cell type detected in 10x samples but rare in SS2 samples, whereas neutrophils were represented only in SS2 samples.

High quality transcriptomes were obtained from ~75,000 cells, 65,662 using 10x and 9,404 using SS2 (Fig. 1a) .\n\nIterative, graph-based clustering was used to identify transcriptionally distinct clusters among cells with high quality transcriptomes separately for each subject 32 . When clustering all cells from a single subject at once, we found that the first principal components defining heterogeneity represented differences in tissue compartment, but some cell types within a compartment (e.g., basal, goblet club, neuroendocrine and ionocyte) had a tendency to co-cluster.\n\nWe therefore initially grouped cells by tissue compartment based on expression of canonical compartment-specific marker genes (Fig. 1b) and then separately clustered cells within each compartment for each subject. Homologous clusters between subjects were subsequently established based on cluster-specific marker genes then merged for downstream analyses; batch correction algorithms were not needed because of centralized and robotic library preparation.\n\nOur approach identified 58 transcriptionally distinct cell populations (mean 51 per subject, Fig.   1c , Table S2 ). A state-of-the-art scRNAseq analysis of human lung published while this paper was in preparation identified 21 (36%) of the 58 lung cell populations described here 33 .\n\nThe 58 identified cell populations included 15 epithelial (clusters 1-15), 9 endothelial (16-24), 9 stromal (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) , and 25 immune populations, greater than the number of classical cell types in each compartment (11 epithelial, 5 endothelial, 7 stromal, 20 immune, and 2 neuronal cell types) (Table S2 ).

No markers were known for bronchial vessels, but in situ staining for cluster-specific markers subsequently identified bronchial endothelial clusters (see below). The only cell type not captured was epithelial tuft cells, which are rare or absent in the normal lung 34 so was not expected to be found (Table S1 ). However, seven of the 23 assigned classical cell types in these three compartments were surprisingly represented by more than one cell cluster (ciliated, basal, alveolar type 2, capillary, bronchial vessel, myofibroblast, and fibroblast), revealing molecular diversity beyond the established lung cell types, as detailed below.\n\nImmune cells were the most heterogeneous compartment presumably because of the critical role of the lung as first responder to inhaled toxins and pathogens, and because the analyzed lung samples were not perfused so included circulating and egressed as well as lung resident immune cells. To aid assignment of identities to the immune cell clusters, we first defined the transcriptional profiles of circulating immune cells by sorting human blood cells using established surface markers followed by bulk RNA sequencing of the sorted cell populations. This defined the transcriptional profiles of 21 functionally-characterized classes of circulating immune cells (Fig. S5a, Table S3 ). We also obtained scRNAseq profiles of ~5000 circulating blood cells from two of the subjects whose lung cells we analyzed. Canonical immune cell markers along with the ascertained panels of differentially-expressed genes allowed us to assign identities to 25 molecularly distinct immune cell clusters obtained in our scRNAseq All rights reserved.

One-quarter of the classical cell types (11 of 45, 24%) previously lacked high quality single cell expression data, either because they had never been profiled or correctly annotated (mucous, capillary, bronchial vessel, airway smooth muscle, lipofibroblast, myofibroblast) or had only been profiled after culturing (artery, pericyte, mesothelium, platelet/megakaryocyte, and intermediate monocyte) (Table S1 ). The only canonical cell types not captured by our approach are extremely rare and primarily found in disease settings (tuft cells) or have structures or features that require special isolation or enrichment methods (intrinsic neurons, Schwann cells, eosinophils). This comprehensive dataset of cell expression profiles suggests novel functions, signaling interactions, and contributions to disease for many canonical cell types, such as a role for lung pericytes in regulation of microvascular tone through circulating hormones and as a culprit in pulmonary hypertension (see below).\n\nAlthough specific clusters were identified for nearly all canonical cell types, many cell types were surprisingly represented by more than one cluster, so the specific identities of 25 clusters remained uncertain. Most of the extra clusters were unlikely to have arisen from batch effects or subject-specific pathology because all except three clusters were found in more than one subject by scRNAseq or in situ hybridization (Table S2 ). This suggested that the distinct All rights reserved.

To begin to distinguish these possibilities, we analyzed the differentially-expressed genes among clusters assigned to each canonical cell type to identify cluster-specific biochemical and biological functions and examined the cells' structure and spatial distribution in the lung.\n\nWe first identified clusters representing common cell states. Three of the clusters (cluster 7, Bas-p; 42, NK/T-p; 48, MP-p) were significantly enriched in expression of cell cycle genes relative to the other cluster(s) of the same cell type, indicating that these represent the proliferative states of basal cells, NK cells, T cells, and macrophages, respectively, and these are the most proliferative cell types in the adult lung (Fig. 2c, S3a ). Approximately 4% of basal cells were in the proliferative cluster (cluster 7, 47 cells), most of which were isolated from proximal lung samples (Fig. S3b) ; this suggests that proximal basal cells are more proliferative than distal ones, consistent with immunostains for proliferation marker KI67. (Fig. S4a ). Another cluster (cluster 6, Bas-d, 308 cells), comprising 28% of all basal cells, had reduced expression of KRT5 and increased expression of HES1, KRT7, and SCGB3A2, indicating that they were differentiating to other epithelial fates 35, 36 , consistent with their transitional morphology (Fig. 2c,   S4b ). Differentiating basal cells also derived mostly from proximal lung samples (Fig. S3b, S4b ).\n\nThese expression patterns and immunostaining suggest that a surprisingly 37 The other basal cell clusters corresponded to quiescent basal cells and localized by smFISH and isolation site either to exclusively proximal (large, pseudostratified) airways (cluster 5, Bas-px), or to both proximal and distal (small, simple) airways (cluster 4, Bas) (Fig. 2d , S3b, All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/742320 doi: bioRxiv preprint S4c). Despite their similar morphology, Bas-px and Bas basal cells are distinguished by hundreds of genes, suggesting they are molecularly distinct cell types or subtypes that differ in hormone production (ALOX15, ADH7, SNCA) and adhesion (POSTN, ISLR, PCDH7), and, based on morphology and immunostaining for proliferation and differentiation markers, perhaps their ability to function as stem cells (Fig. 2c) . We also found distinct clusters (clusters 2, 3) and associated molecular signatures along the proximal-distal axis for ciliated cells, indicating additional heterogeneity among epithelial cells along this axis, consistent with a recent study 33 (Fig. S3b,c) . smFISH of DHRS9, restricted in expression to proximal ciliated cells, localized this population to larger pseudostratified airways (Fig. S4d ).\n\nWe uncovered two clusters (14, 15) of alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells (Fig. 2e) , which produce surfactant that prevents alveolar collapse. These were intermingled throughout the alveolar epithelium, as shown by in situ localization of cluster-specific markers (Fig. 2f) . One of the clusters (cluster 14, marked by WIF1, HHIP, CA2) expressed higher levels of some canonical AT2 markers (e.g., surfactant genes SFTPA1 and SFTPC and transcription factor ETV5), and also selectively expressed inhibitors of Wnt (WIF1) and Hedgehog (HHIP) signaling as well as the cell cycle (CDKN1A), implying the cells are quiescent (Fig. S3d, left) . The other, 10-fold less abundant cluster (cluster 15, marked by CP and lacking WIF1 and HHIP) selectively expressed detoxification genes (CP, GSTA1, CYP4B1) as well as Wnt pathway genes including a ligand (WNT5A), co-receptor (LRP5), regulatory protein (CTNNBIP1), and canonical transcription factor (TCF4/TCF7L2) (Fig. S3d, right) ; we refer to these as AT2-signaling (AT2-s). AT2-s could be alveolar stem cells, homologous to the rare subpopulation of Wnt-active AT2 cells recently identified in mouse (AT2 stem ) 38,39 , whereas cluster 15 could be classical AT2 cells, homologous to \"bulk\" AT2 cells of mouse.

We also identified new cell types or subtypes in the stroma, the least characterized lung compartment. Two cell clusters (29, 30) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/742320 doi: bioRxiv preprint S4m). Both express genes involved in canonical fibroblast functions including extracellular matrix biosynthesis, cell adhesion, and angiogenesis regulators and other intercellular signals and modulators. However the specific genes for these functions often differ, for example adventitial fibroblasts expressed different Wnt pathway modulators (SFRP2) than those of alveolar fibroblasts (NKD1, RSPO1) (Fig. S3e) . Each cluster also appears to have distinct functions: specific expression of voltage-gated sodium channel SCN7A and glutamate receptor GRIA1 suggest alveolar fibroblasts are excitable cells that receive glutamatergic input (Table S4 ). The expression profiles also suggest novel, shared immune functions including immune cell recruitment (IL1RL1, IL32, CXCL2, MHCII) and the complement system (C2, C3, C7, CFI, CFD, CFH, CFB) (Table S4) .\n\nTwo other stromal clusters (clusters 27 and 28) were enriched for ACTA2, a canonical marker of myofibroblasts (Fig. 2i) , cells that help form alveoli during development and can act inappropriately later in disease. One of these (cluster 27, marked by WIF1, FGF18, ASPN) are classical myofibroblasts, which were isolated from distal lung samples and localized to alveolar ducts (Fig. S4o) . The other population (cluster 28) showed higher expression of contractile genes (MYH11, CNN1, TAGLN), was preferentially isolated from proximal lung samples, and was found both intermingled with airway smooth muscle and in alveoli (Fig. S3b,S4n ), so we call them \"fibromyocytes.\" Both populations shared expression of genes for canonical fibroblast functions (e.g. ECM genes VCAN, COL12A1, CLU), though the specific genes differed from both alveolar and adventitial fibroblasts, and they also both expressed a rich set of genes associated with TGF-beta signaling (LTBP1, LTBP2, ASPN, DPT, TGFBR3, TGFBI, SCX, MDFI) (Table S4) .\n\nAll rights reserved.

This indicated that not only are alveolar macrophages (clusters 47, 48), myeloid dendritic type 1 cells (50), and basophil/mast cells (44, 45) lung resident 41 or greatly enriched in the lung interstitium or lumen as expected, but surprisingly so are natural killer T cells (40) and intermediate monocytes (58). We also discovered four novel lung myeloid populations (52, 53, 54, 56) that are lung resident or greatly enriched. These appear to have specialized functions and localizations: IGSF21+ dendritic cells express genes implicated in asthma (CCL2, CCL13, IGSF21) and localize proximal vessels, rare EREG+ dendritic cells are enriched in developmental signals (EREG, VEGFA, AREG) and also localize to proximal vessels, and TREM2+ dendritic cells express lipid handling machinery (APOC1, APOE, CYP27A1) and localize to both vessels and alveoli (Fig. 3c, S5d-g) .\n\nThe other immune cell types were found in both the lung and blood samples. For some cell types, every cell-whether from blood or lung-clustered together. This included B cells (cluster 34), plasma cells (35) , platelets/megakaryocytes (46) , plasmacytoid dendritic cells (49), and neutrophils (43) . For other cell types (every T cell subset, natural killer cells, myeloid dendritic type 2 cells, and both classical and nonclassical monocytes), the cells from lung formed a separate cluster from those from the blood. Some of the differentially-expressed genes may be due to technical differences (e.g., collagenase treatment of lung but not blood 42 or circulating RNA in blood 43 ), but other detected differences such as upregulation in lung cells of lymphocyte-residence gene CD69 likely represent genes induced following egression 44 .

We also discovered a residency signature for lung myeloid cells (e.g. AREG, MPHOSPH6, HBEGF). This signature partially overlaps with the one for lymphocytes, supporting a core residency program for immune cells as well as specific subprograms for myeloid cells and lymphocytes.\n\nOur nearly complete gene expression atlas for the adult human lung has important implications for medicine. We identified the most selective marker genes for each of the previously known and newly identified cell types (Fig. 4a , Table S4 ). A battery of ~200 markers can unambiguously distinguish virtually all lung cell types (Fig. 4b) , so could be used with multiplex in situ hybridization methods [46] [47] [48] to simultaneously detect in clinical specimens any alterations in their numbers, structures, and spatial relationships, ushering in a new era of diagnostic pathology. A similar compendium of cell-type-selective membrane proteins (Table   S4 ) could be used to purify or therapeutically target specific lung cell types. We also identified the transcription factors selectively enriched in each cell type (Fig. 4e, Table S4 ), putative \"master regulators\" that can be used to create each cell type by cellular reprogramming, and whose efficacy in reprogramming can be evaluated with the markers described above. We found ~400 such transcription factors (1 to 36 for nearly every cell type in our SS2 data), over half of which are novel (Fig. 4e, red text) . This includes what may be the long-sought master regulators (such as MYRF) of alveolar epithelial type 1 (AT1) cells, which comprise nearly all of the lung's gas exchange surface and are impacted in many important lung diseases, and a regulator of pericyte identity (TBX5). We confirmed specific expression of MYRF in AT1 cells and TBX5 in All rights reserved.

These ~400 cell-type selective transcription factors are excellent candidates for creating differentiation protocols for nearly all the cell types needed to engineer a human lung.\n\nThe expression atlas allowed us to map the direct cell targets in the lung of circulating hormones, based on expression patterns of their cognate receptors. Receptors for some hormones (e.g., glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1, insulin receptor INSR, IGF receptor IGF1R, and adiponectin receptors ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2; all related to cell growth) are broadly expressed, implying direct action of these hormones throughout the lung, with some notable exceptions such as lymphocytes (Fig. 5a ). Other hormones have highly specific and unexpected targets, such as somatostatin (SSTR1 expressed only in arteries), mineralocorticoids (NR3C2, goblet cells), parathyroid hormone (PTH1R, smooth muscle, pericytes), ghrelin (GHSR, neuroendocrine cells), melanocortin (ionocytes and lipofibroblasts), and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIPR) and oxytocin (OXTR) (ciliated cells). Pericytes are predicted targets of angiotensin, endothelin, parathyroid hormone, and prostacyclin, which could regulate their contractile machinery to tune alveolar perfusion ( Fig. 5b ) similar to vascular smooth muscle control of arterial flow. The receptor genes for half of all circulating hormones (e.g. opioids, human growth hormone, and glucagon) were not detectably expressed in any lung cell type so may not directly influence lung physiology.\n\nWe next used the expression map to predict other signaling interactions among lung cells by identifying complementary expression patterns of ligands and their receptors among cells in the airways and accompanying vessels and among alveolar cells using CellPhoneDB 25 (see Methods). This analysis predicts diverse sets of up to hundreds of interactions of each lung cell type and its neighbors, with stromal cells the leading interactors largely due to growth factormediated signaling interactions (Fig. S6 ).\n\nAll rights reserved.

Our data confirmed canonical homing interactions such as expression of CCR7 by CD4+ T cells guiding them to CCL21-producing lymphatic vessels (green in Fig. 5c ), and provides specificity for others such as CCR10-mediated plasma cell homing to epithelial mucosa through CCL28 from serous cells in submucosal glands (gold). It also predicts new interactions such as CXCR3-mediated homing of pDCs to CXCL9-expressing TREM2+ dendritic cells (blue), and CX3CR1-mediated homing of nonclassical monocytes to CX3CL1-expressing endothelial cells and airway epithelial cells (purple). The novel dendritic populations do not express CCR6 and CCR7, which guide myeloid dendritic cells to CCL21-expressing lymphatic vessels, suggesting they do not egress via lymphatics. However, all three express CCR1 (orange), which could mediate their attraction to veins that express ligand CCL23, as well as to bronchial endothelial cells (CCL14), ciliated cells (CCL15), and lymphocytes (CCL5). We also identified ionocytes (bold, red), the main source of Cftr expression in the mouse airway, as the only nonimmune cell to express appreciable levels of any chemokine receptor (CXCR4), whose ligand (CXCL12) is curiously expressed almost exclusively by non-immune cells.\n\nWe used the lung atlas to map the cellular sites of expression of the 233 extant genes that cause or contribute to human lung disease, curated from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database 49 (179 genes) and GWAS studies 50 (54 genes, -log(p-value) > 20, see Methods). Disease genes that showed cell-type-specific expression within the lung are of special interest (Fig. 6a) , because they can pinpoint the cell type(s) in which the disease originates, especially significant for the many lung diseases whose cellular origins are poorly understood.

It also identified potential novel culprit and contributing cells for 21 genes implicated in 15 diseases, including pericytes in pulmonary hypertension (potassium channel KCNK3), capillaries in atrioventricular dysplasia (ACVRL1), and AT2 cells in COPD (SERPINA1, HMOX1, HHIP). We confirmed pericyte, capillary, and AT2 expression of disease genes by smFISH (Fig. 6c-e) .\n\nWe also mapped lung expression of 80 genes encoding proteins implicated as cellular receptors for human viruses (Fig. S8a ), including 26 used by airborne viruses that enter primarily through epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract (Fig. 6b) . NECTIN4, a receptor for measles virus was enriched in club, ciliated, Bas-D, and goblet cells, and CDHR3, the receptor for common-cold Rhinovirus C was enriched in ciliated and neuroendocrine cells, implying viral tropism and pathogenesis through these bronchial cell types. By contrast, ACE2, used by SARS and COVID-19 coronaviruses, and DPP4 used by MERS coronavirus, were both detected at low levels but enriched in alveolar AT2 cells (Fig S8b) , consistent with clinical data indicating lung pathology and respiratory distress of these epidemic/pandemic-prone diseases initiates in the alveolar region 51 .\n\nOur recent construction of a mouse lung cell atlas from young, middle-aged and elderly adult animals 19 , supplemented with additional mouse lung cells and annotated as above for human lung (see Methods), allowed us to analyze the evolutionary conservation and divergence of lung cell types at single cell resolution and across the transcriptome.

A striking result was that mice appear to lack 17 (29%) of the 58 molecularly-defined human lung cell populations, including many of the newly identified human molecular types (proximal ciliated (3); proximal (5), differentiating (6) , and proliferating (7) basal; AT2-s (15);\n\nCap-i1 (20) and i2 (21) capillary cells; bronchial vessel 1 (22) and 2 (23); fibromyocytes (28), lipofibroblasts (31); IGSF21+ (52), EREG+ (53), TREM2+ (54) dendritic cells; and OLR1+ monocytes (56)). Some of the missing cell populations might be rare (e.g. Cap-i1 and i2 as well as Bro1 and 2), transient (e.g. Bas-d and Bas-p), unstable (e.g. LipF), or too diverged to relate transcriptionally (e.g. TREM2+ DC) in mice so may be uncovered by further scRNA sequencing and functional follow up. By contrast, only five mouse molecular types, all immune cells (Zbtb32+ B, Ly6g5b+ T, Alox5+ T, Ccr7+ DC, and interstitial macrophages), were not found in human. These results suggest that there has been substantial molecular diversification and specialization of lung cell types during human evolution (or reduction and streamlining during mouse evolution). This also has important implications for medicine because mice would not be expected to accurately model any human disease for which an implicated cell type was missing or substantially altered.\n\nTo characterize the conservation in the transcriptomes of homologous cell types, we compared expression levels of all active genes in each human cell type with the expression levels of the orthologous genes in the corresponding mouse cell type (Fig. S9 ). Most cell types showed highly conserved expression patterns as expected, with CD4+ memory/effector T cells showing the greatest conservation (correlation coefficient 0.76) and plasma cells the least (0.56).\n\nSurprisingly, one human cell type (goblet cells) showed greater correlation with another mouse cell type (club cells, 0.68) than with the homologous type (goblet cells, 0.63) (Fig. 7b) , despite the conserved expression in goblet cells of canonical markers and the master transcription factor All rights reserved.

Corresponding cell types in human and mouse diverged significantly in the expression (>20-fold change, p < 0.05) of tens to hundreds of homologous genes, with CD4+ M/E T cells showing the fewest diverged genes (79) and basophils the most (343) (Fig. 7c) . The lung as a whole had fewer divergently-expressed genes (60) than any one cell type, suggesting expression lost in one cell type is usually gained in another (Fig. 7c ). Diverged genes varied above age-related expression changes in mice (Fig. S11 ) and included canonical cell type markers, transcription factors, signaling molecules, and disease genes (see below).\n\nEvolutionary changes in gene expression occurred in several different cellular scenarios (Table S7) . Type 0 (\"conserved\") genes are expressed in exactly the same cell types in mouse and human lungs (Fig. 7d , S10b). Type 1 (\"expression gain/loss\") genes show simple gain (or loss) of expression in the lung between species, which could involve a single cell type (Type 1a, e.g. PGC expressed in human, but not mouse, AT2 cells, Fig. 7d ), multiple cell types including full tissue compartments (Type 1b, e.g. RNASE1 expressed in human, but not mouse, epithelial and endothelial cells, Fig. S10c ), or the entire lung (Type 1c, TRIM38 expressed in all human, but not mouse, lung cell types, Fig. S10c ). Type 2 (\"expression expansion/contraction\") changes involve gain (or loss) of expression in additional lung cell types such that expression of the gene expanded (or contracted) in the lung during evolution. For example, Hopx, the canonical AT1selective transcription factor in mouse, is expressed in both AT1 and AT2 cells in human (Fig.   7d ,f), implying the existence of other key AT1 transcription factors (such as MYRF (see above), which shows AT1-selective expression in both species (Fig. S9g) ) and important changes in the AT2 expression program; and expansion in endothelial cell type expression of RAMP3, a coreceptor for vasodilators CGRP and adrenomedullin (ADM), that presumably alters the pulmonary vascular response to these hormones (Fig. S10d ).\n\nAll rights reserved.

Thus, the expression patterns of nearly all (94%) genes are labile during organ evolution, with most genes undergoing broadening (~55%, Type 2 change) or simple gain/loss (29%, Type 1) of expression, and more rarely cell type switching (10%, Type 3) (Table S8 ). It will be important to unravel the genetic mechanisms underlying such widespread evolutionary changes in gene expression and the selective forces operative for the small number of genes with conserved expression, and the consequences for cellular function and mouse models of human diseases.\n\nAll rights reserved.

This provides expression profiles for 41 of the 45 known human lung cell types, missing just the exceedingly rare intrinsic neurons and glia (estimated ~0.001% of lung cells) and tuft cells and eosinophils that are prominent only in diseased lungs. We identified 14 novel cell populations distributed across the four tissue compartments (epithelial, endothelial, stromal, and immune) that were as distinct molecularly as the canonical cell types. These include an abundant alveolar epithelial cell type (AT2-s) intermingled with the classical cell types (AT1 and AT2), which may have stem cell function; two molecularly distinct and intermingled alveolar capillary cell types (Cap-a, Cap); new fibroblast subtypes including alveolar and adventitial fibroblasts and ones we call \"fibromyocytes\" that share markers with airway smooth muscle; and three new resident dendritic cell populations (DC-IGSF21+, EREG+, TREM2+). Each of the newly identified molecular cell types must be thoroughly characterized to define their structures, functions, stabilities, development, and role in disease, as we have done for the two types of alveolar capillary cells (Gillich et al.). If there are other human lung cell types, subtypes, or cell states, they must be exceedingly rare, fragile, region-(lobe) or stage-specific (younger or older donors), or so similar to the 58 molecular types described here that they are not resolved by current profiling and clustering methods.\n\nThis comprehensive molecular cell atlas has important implications for human physiology and medicine. The cellular expression patterns predict tens to hundreds of signaling interactions between each of the cell types, many of them new and unexpected. The atlas suggests where hormones act, including 12 hormones with specific cell targeting inferred from All rights reserved.

It provides the relative abundance of each immune cell type isolated from the lung and circulation-and allowed us to identify lung resident and homing cell types and to infer the expression changes they undergo following egression as well as the cellular sources of the homing signals. The atlas provides expression maps of the hundreds of genes that have been implicated genetically in lung diseases and as receptors for human viruses, and uncovered dozens of genes with highly specific lung expression patterns that point to likely \"culprit cells\" or targets in 28 lung diseases and respiratory infections. It also identified the transcription factors selectively expressed in lung cell types that can be used to rationally design cellular reprogramming strategies for tissue engineering of an entire lung.\n\nOur recent creation of a similar lung atlas in mouse provided an unprecedented opportunity in evolutionary biology to comprehensively compare lung cell types and their molecular functions across species 19 . This revealed that mice lack 17 of 58 (~29%) of the molecular cell types and subtypes in the human lung, including most (~86%, 12 of 14) of the newly discovered molecular types. This suggests a dramatic expansion of cell types in the human lineage (or streamlining in the mouse lineage), perhaps to provide new functions, durability, or regenerative capacity for our much larger (6000-fold) lungs and 30-times longer lifespan 52,53 .\n\nEven homologous cell types diverged in expression of tens to hundreds of genes. Indeed, we found that gene expression is remarkably labile during evolution, with only 7% of expressed genes showing conserved cellular expression patterns. Most genes (~55%) have undergone evolutionary broadening or consolidation in their expression pattern, and some (29%) show simple gain or loss of lung expression; the rest (10%) switched cell types. These results suggest widespread gain, loss, or conversion of cell-type-specific transcriptional enhancers during All rights reserved.

Expression changes included important transcription factors, signaling molecules, and disease genes-highlighting the need for caution when using mouse models.\n\nIndeed, the atlases predict where mouse models will fail, such as for human diseases where a culprit cell is missing in mouse or does not express the homolog of the disease gene.\n\nOur approach improves on state-of-the-art methods that recently uncovered just over a third (21) of the 58 lung molecular types described here 33 , and provides a paradigm for the human cell atlas project that can be easily adapted for other organs. Best practices that served this project and should be useful for other organ atlases include: compiling from the literature a The tissue location of each cell cluster, including most of the newly identified molecular types, provides an initial atlas of not only cell identities and expression profiles but their environment, which enhances the value of each transcriptome by suggesting local interactions All rights reserved.

Perhaps the greatest utility of the atlas will come from comparisons to similarly rich profiles of additional lungs to parse normal variation from technical noise, from other life stages to elucidate how each cell type develops and ages, and to profiles of diseased lung tissue to define which and how cells are molecularly altered in disease 54,55 . Indeed, this atlas should speed the molecular transition in pathology because now almost every lung cell type can be distinguished by the optimal set of sensitive and specific markers. And, with the progress in spatial transcriptomics [46] [47] [48] , it may soon be possible to obtain full expression profiles of all cells in situ, which would provide context for the individual cell variations seen in scRNAseq data and potentially reveal transient and specialized cell interactions and the dynamics of disease.\n\nAll rights reserved.

We obtained additional tissue from two mice expressing Cre recombinase and two expressing estrogeninducible Cre recombinase (Cre-ERT2) for conditional cell-specific labeling in vivo with the gene-targeted alleles FVB-Tbx4-LME-Cre 57,58 (lung stroma) and B6.129-Axin2-Cre-ERT2 57 , respectively. Cre-dependent reporter alleles Rosa26ZsGreen1, which expresses cytosolic ZsGreen1 following Cre-mediated recombination, and Rosa26mTmG, which expresses membrane-targeted GFP (mGFP) following recombination and membrane-targeted tdTomato (mTomato) in all other tissues, were used to label cells expressing Tbx4 and Axin2, respectively 59,60 .

Briefly, counts (SS2) and UMIs (10x) were normalized across cells, scaled per million (SS2) or per 10,000 (10x), and converted to log scale using the 'NormalizeData' function.

Doublets were identified by searching for cells with substantial and coherent expression profiles from two or more tissue compartments and/or cell types.\n\nTo assign clusters identities, we first compiled a list of all established lung cell types, their abundances, their classical markers, and any RNA markers (when available) (Table S1 ). RNA markers for canonical immune populations were obtained using the 'MAST' statistical framework (Table S4) . Clusters were assigned a canonical identity based on enriched expression of these marker genes. There were no clusters that lacked expression of canonical marker genes.\n\nWhen two or more clusters were assigned the same identity, we first determined whether their tissue locations differed substantially (e.g. proximal versus distal, alveolar versus adventitial) and prepended these locations when applicable. When both clusters localized to the same tissue region (e.g. capillary endothelial cells or AT2 cells), we next compared their differentially expressed genes head-to-head to identify differences in molecular functions. These functional differences were also prepended, when applicable (e.g. Signaling AT2 versus AT2, Proliferative Basal versus Basal). If the clusters could not be resolved by location or function, we prepended a representative marker gene to their \"canonical\" identity (e.g. IGSF21+ Dendritic, EREG+ Dendritic, and TREM2+ Dendritic).

Cells from each tissue compartment were then iteratively re-clustered until differentially-expressed genes driving clustering were no longer biologically meaningful.\n\nCell cluster annotation was based on expression of canonical marker genes from the literature, markers found through RNA sequencing of purified cell populations (Bulk RNA markers), ascertained tissue location, and inferred molecular function from differentially-expressed genes.\n\nAll rights reserved.

All stains were done on lungs from at least two human subjects distinct from those used for profiling; quantifications represent >10 fields of view. Cell types with >90% enrichment in lung samples are annotated \"lung resident\" (Res, alveolar macrophages) or \"lung homing\" (Hom), those with >90% enrichment in blood as \"intravascular\" (IV), and all others as \"egressed\" (Egr).
