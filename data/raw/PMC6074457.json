{"title": "Descriptive epidemiology and characteristics of confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in the Makkah Region of Saudi Arabia, March to June 2014", "body": "The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is divided into thirteen regions that each has a governorate and sub-governorates with a capital. Makkah is the capital of region while Jeddah is the largest port city. The Ministry of Health (MoH) is the main public institution responsible for provision of preventive, curative, and rehabilitative healthcare services for the entire population. The MoH is not only responsible for the management, planning, financing, and regulation of the healthcare sector through primary healthcare centers (PHCs), generalized and specialized hospitals, but also for overall supervision of private healthcare facilities. After a report of a suspected case of MERS is generated at a PHC, it is sent to secondary or tertiary care hospitals and the relevant health directorates of the MoH for strategic action.\n\nThis descriptive study was conducted at the Department of Public Health, Directorate General of Health Affairs, Makkah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Secondary data were collected from all confirmed cases that had been reported by public and private hospitals serving four cities of the Makkah Region ( Jeddah, Makkah, Kunfudah, and Taif ) between March and June 2014. The data were compiled in Makkah for retrospective review and analysis.\n\nA preformed Excel data sheet listing demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, outcome, and epidemiological risk factors was e-mailed to all cities for reporting of data on these factors by designated health officials. The data were cross-checked and clarified and missing data were provided through direct communication with the appropriate health directorates. The variables for which data were collected were patient code; age; sex; nationality; occupation; clinical signs; symptoms; co-morbid conditions; white blood cell (WBC) and platelet (PLT) counts; real-time polymerase chain reaction results; radiological evidence of pneumonia; epidemiological risk factors (i.e., status as a healthcare worker, travel to endemic regions, and/or exposure to a laboratory-confirmed case or MERS-associated animal); time and place of symptom onset; and outcome as recovered, transferred, died, and discharged.\n\nThe Excel sheets were carefully reviewed by the responsible physicians before the data were cleaned of any missing information and then cross-tabulated. Using the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Epi Info program, data on demographic, clinical, laboratory, and exposure factors and comorbid conditions were analyzed. The odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated as indicators of the strength of associations.\n\nA P value of <.05 was considered an indication of statistical significance. The case fatality rate was calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the total number of confirmed cases.\n\nThe study protocol was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Makkah Region. Unique patient codes were issued to each study participant to maintain anonymity. Confidentiality was maintained throughout the study and no personal identifiers were listed on the Excel data sheet.\n\nThe initial case definition of MERS was the presence of one or more of the symptoms of acute respiratory infection:fever \u226538\u00b0C; cough; shortness of breath with radiological evidence of pneumonia; clinical or radiological evidence of pneumonia; and, subsequently, intensive care unit admission. A revised \u201chighly sensitive\u201c case definition that included broader clinical and laboratory criteria was published on May 13, 2014 and subsequently adopted by the MoH.21\n\nAs of September 6, 2014, 261 confirmed cases had been reported in the Makkah Region between March and June 2014, indicating a MERS incidence of 3.49 per 100 000 (95% CI 3.09\u20133.95). The majority of cases were reported in Jeddah (203, 78%), followed by Makkah (39, 15%), Taif (13, 5%), and Kunfudah (6, 2%). Of these confirmed cases, 147 (56%) were Saudis (incidence 3.39 per 100000, 95% CI 2.86\u20133.95) and 114 (44%) non-Saudis (incidence 3.70 per 100 000, 95% CI 3.07\u20134.43; Table 1). In order of decreasing incidence, the non-Saudis were from the Philippines (27), India (12), Yemen (12), Syria (11), Egypt (9) Palestine (9), Bangladesh (7), Indonesia (6), Sudan (5), Pakistan (4), Burma (3), Jordan (2), Turkey (1), Ethiopia (1), Morocco (1), Lebanon (1), Eritrea (1), South Africa (1), and Australia (1).\n\nOf confirmed cases, 171 (66%) were males and 90 (34%) females with a ratio of (male: female; 2:1) (Figure 1). In Jeddah, 143 (70%) were males (mean age 49.7 years, range 8\u201390 years) and 60 (30%) females (mean age 45.0 years, range 13\u201375 years). In Makkah, 19 (49%) were males (mean age 44.3 years, range 14\u201384 years) and 20 (51%) females (mean age 39.5 years, range 18\u201369 years). In Taif, 5 (38%) were males (mean age 43.2 years, range 31\u201359 years) and 8 (62%) females (mean age 57.2 years, range 30\u201374 years). In Kunfudah, 4 (67%) were males (mean age 50.5 years, range 36\u201365 years) and 2 (33%) females (mean age 35.5 years, range 26\u201345 years).\n\nThe first index case reported was diagnosed in the last week of March 2014. According to a review of the report, the peak in the number of confirmed cases occurred in mid-April 2014 before the number began to decline in the last week of April 2014, with the last confirmed case reported in June 2014 (Figure 2, 3). In Makkah, Taif, and Kunfudah, all confirmed cases were reported by public healthcare facilities (HCFs). In Jeddah alone, the cases were reported by both public HCFs (64%) and private HCFs (21%). Among all confirmed cases, only 148 (57%) had recovered or been discharged. The majority of fatal cases had been reported in Jeddah (91 cases, 45%), followed by Makkah (13 cases, 33%), Taif (5 cases, 38%), and Kunfudah (1 case, 16%). Only 2 (5%) cases had been re-hospitalized in Makkah city due to complications (Figure 2). The fatality rate among all confirmed cases had been 42% (110 cases). As the data is between a limited period (March to June 2014), seasonality cannot be determined.\n\nAmong all confirmed cases, 84 (32%) had been healthcare workers (HCWs) and 177 (68%) had been non-health care workers (non-HCWs; Figure 3). The majority of HCW cases had been reported in Jeddah (63 cases, 31%), followed by Makkah (16 cases, 41%), Taif (4 cases, 31%), and Kunfudah (1 case, 17%). The majority of HCW cases were nurses (36 cases, 43%), followed by physicians (22 cases, 26%), technicians (8, 9%), administrative clerks (7 cases, 8%), healthcare-related cleaners (5 cases, 6%), and other healthcare-related workers (6 cases, 7%), (Table 2). Epidemiological risk factors for cases in Makkah were travel to Turkey (1 case, 3%), attendance at a festival or pilgrimage (1 case, 3%), contact with an infected human (16 cases, 41%), contact with an animal (3 cases, 7%), and visit to an HCF 14 days prior to symptom onset (22 cases, 56%).\n\nEpidemiological risk factors for cases in Jeddah were visit to an HCF 14 days prior to symptom onset (59 cases, 29%), travel to domestic cities (2 cases, 1%), attendance at a festival or pilgrimage (3 cases, 1%), contact with an infected human (23 cases, 11%), and contact with an animal (3 cases, 1%) were identified. In Taif, visit to an HCF 14 days prior to symptom onset (1 case, 7%), travel to domestic cities (3 cases, 23%), contact with an infected human (1 case, 7%), and contact with an animal (3 cases, 23%) were identified. In Kunfudah, contact with an infected human (6 cases, 100%) and travel to domestic cities (2 cases, 33%) were identified.\n\nRegarding symptomatology, 185 cases (71%) showed signs and symptoms while 42 cases (16%) remained asymptomatic. The most common signs and symptoms were cough (170 cases, 65%), fever >38\u00b0C (165 cases, 63%), radiological evidence of pneumonia (146 cases, 60%), shortness of breath (136 cases, 52%), joint pain or swelling (137 cases, 52%), fatigue (108 cases, 41%), sore throat (96 cases, 37%), fever with chills (95 cases, 36%), tachypnea (78 cases, 30%), wheezing or abnormal breathing (68 cases, 26%), chest pain (66 cases, 25%), headaches (59 cases, 23%), altered consciousness (53 cases, 20%), pharyngitis (39 cases, 15%), vomiting (32 cases, or 12%), runny nose (30 cases, 11%), diarrhea (27 cases, 10%), abdominal pain (26 cases, 10%), nausea (20 cases, 7%), hemoptysis (11 cases, 4%), local neurological deficit (10 cases, 4%), and conjunctivitis (6 cases, 2%). Of the 122 cases (47%) with co-morbid conditions, the most common were hypertension (76 cases, 29%), diabetes (72 cases, 28%), heart disease (47 cases, 18%), obesity (41 cases, 16%), smoking (41 cases, 16%), chronic renal disease (39 cases, 15%), immune-compromised status (24 cases, 9%), chronic lung disease (19 cases, 7%), steroid use (19 cases, 7%), asthma (12 cases, 5%), chronic liver disease (8 cases, 3%), cancer (5 cases, 2%), pregnancy (5 cases, 2%), chronic hematologic disease (2 cases, 0.7%), systemic lupus erythematosus (2 cases, 0.7%), eclampsia (1 case, 0.4%), and hypothyroid (1 case, 0.4%). Using the WBC count cut-off values of low (<4\u00d7109/L), normal (4\u201311\u00d7109/L), and high (>11\u00d7109/L), 50 (19%) had a low, 85 (33%) a normal, and 16 (6%) a high WBC count, while data were unavailable for 110 (42%) (Table 3). Using the PLT count cutoff values of very low (<50\u00d7109/L), low (<150\u00d7109/L), normal (150\u2013400\u00d7109/L), and high (>400\u00d7109/L), 9 (3%) had a very low, 40 (15%) had a low, 98 (38%) had a normal, and 7 (%) had a high PLT count, while data were unavailable for 108 (41%).\n\nThe mortality among non-HCW cases was higher (OR 12.8, 95% CI 6.02\u201327.2, P<.001) compared to HCW cases, higher among males (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.08\u20133.12, P<.02) compared to females, higher among those aged \u226550 years (OR 6.1, 95% CI 3.56\u201310.46, P<.001) compared to those aged <50 years, and higher among primary cases (OR 3.34, 95% CI 1.97\u20135.73, P<.001) compared to secondary cases. The symptoms identified as significant risk factors at the time of diagnosis were shortness of breath (OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.55\u20134.26, P<.001), chest pain (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.13\u20133.91, P<.02), altered level of consciousness (OR 3.51, 95% CI 1.88\u20136.58, P<.001), tachypnea (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1\u20133.25, P<.02), and radiological evidence of pneumonia (OR 11.15, 95% CI 5.82\u201321.38, P<.001). Smoking (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.4\u20131.55, P=.48), diabetes mellitus (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.47\u20131.41, P=.47), and chronic renal disease (OR 1.5, 95% CI 0.75\u20133.00, P=.25) were not found to be significant risk factors, nor was contact with animals for either primary or secondary cases (OR 3.29, 95% CI 0.8\u201314.11, P=.13).\n\nThe primary limitation was that private healthcare facilities in Makkah, Taif, Kunfudah, and other regional cities did not report whether they had treated any confirmed cases during the study period. As the actual MERS-related morbidity and mortality for these cities could not be determined, the fatality rate (42%) may have been underestimated. As suspected, cases that presented at community or private clinics in these cities may not have been included in the analysis, so the results may not truly reflect the severity and impact of MERS.\n\nThis study yielded several valuable findings on the epidemiology and characteristics of MERS cases. Regarding nationality, Saudis and non-Saudis appear to have almost the same risk of exposure. Among all nationalities, Filipinos appear to be at highest risk, as the majority of nurses in Saudi Arabia are Filipino. Regarding occupation, healthcare workers are at higher risk of acquiring MERS than non-HCWs. Regarding sex, males in Jeddah appear more susceptible, probably due to their participation in outdoor activities, while females in Taif appear more susceptible, probably due to their exposure to confirmed cases in the home. Regarding symptomatology, the frequent finding of cough (65%), fever >38\u00b0C (63%), radiological evidence of pneumonia (60%), and shortness of breath (52%) among symptomatic cases validates the current MERS case definition and the findings of other regional studies. A particularly important finding was that despite strict MoH requirements that public and private healthcare facilities report cases of any notifiable diseases, including MERS,21 and the establishment of hotlines throughout the country, the reporting of all MERS cases remains challenging. As the regular reporting of cases to higher authorities is essential for key decision making,21 this challenge must be overcome.\n\nKnowledge of epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics will help identify gaps; set goals for further research; and strengthen strategic decision-making in MERS reporting, control, and treatment. This knowledge will assist in the establishment of health facilities and isolation wards; procurement of personal protective gear, ambulances, ventilators, laboratory equipment, and supplies; hiring of additional healthcare staff; and enhancing capacity through appropriate training. Central to this effort is establishing private\u2013public healthcare partnerships for both effective response and collaborative research. Further regional studies performed collaboratively by experts from universities, the private sector, regional health directorates, the WHO, and the CDC are required to gain knowledge of the true epidemiology and burden of MERS."}
