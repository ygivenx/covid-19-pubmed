{"title": "Trends in parameterization, economics and host behaviour in influenza pandemic modelling: a review and reporting protocol", "body": "Influenza pandemics are overwhelmingly large scale phenomena that may result in high morbidity, mortality and large economic impacts worldwide. The influenza pandemic of 1918\u20139 is believed to have caused excess mortality of 20\u201340 million people [1]. Influenza pandemics have occurred during the 20th century and beginning of the 21st century at intervals of between 10 and 40 years, with the latest pandemics occurring in 1918\u20139, 1957\u20138, 1968\u20139 [2] and 2009\u201310 [3]. Pharmaceutical and public health measures can help mitigate the impacts of pandemics [4,5] and were implemented by many governments during the last pandemic in 2009\u201310 [6,7].\n\nBecause empirical or field studies of population-level strategies to control or mitigate influenza pandemics are generally either infeasible (e.g. controlling movement of people within a city) or unethical (e.g. withholding vaccination of subpopulations to assess the effect on transmission), modelling is one of the only suitable methodologies to enable multiple hypothetical pandemic preparedness and mitigation scenarios to be assessed. Epidemic models are especially useful to address epidemiological, economic, and individuals\u2019 behavioural questions [8-10]. The usefulness of epidemic models in directing mitigation efforts has been supported by empirical findings that have echoed previous modelling predictions. For instance, models predicted that reduced international air travel would be unlikely to stop an influenza pandemic [11], a finding later verified empirically during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [12,13]; other models predicted the potential of antiviral prophylaxis and contact tracing to control small outbreaks [5], a prediction also verified in real-life outbreaks in semi-closed army camps [14].\n\nFor epidemic models to produce reasonable predictions on the course of the epidemic and how it can be controlled, we need to be confident that the model captures the essential mechanisms that drive the epidemic dynamics [15]. It is therefore essential to parameterize the model from available data [15,16] and validate the model to increase its credibility [17]. One of the main focuses of this review is to evaluate the trends in the construction and validation of mechanistic models \u2014 models that explicitly incorporate the mechanisms or processes underlying the outcomes of the system \u2014 of infection dynamics for influenza pandemic preparedness, control and mitigation. Traditionally, the main approach for mechanistic modelling of influenza pandemics has been based on compartmental models (Table 1) represented by systems of differential equations. Compartmental models represented the dynamics of a host-disease system for which a tractable analytical solution could in principle be derived through mathematical methods [8,18]. It was not until the widespread availability of modern computing power that more complex compartmental models for which analytical solutions could not be derived and agent-based models (ABMs, Table 1) explored using computer simulation became an attractive alternative. Recent modelling work, dealing with the threat of an influenza pandemic of avian origin (A-H5N1), with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis in 2003 and the H1N1 2009 pandemic, has exemplified the use of both models solved analytically and through simulation [3,5,19,20].\n\nPandemic preparedness, control and mitigation modelling has heretofore been reviewed [21-25]. These reviews show a bewildering array of models that have been introduced, especially since the 2009 pandemic, with different purposes, outcomes and structures. Despite the usefulness of modelling, few public health practitioners or decision makers undergo explicit training in modelling techniques. When combined with the rapid growth in modelling capabilities driven by increasing computing power, and the multitude of different disciplines \u2013 e.g. economics, psychology, genetics \u2013 that contribute to modelling epidemics, this makes it daunting to keep abreast of all that modelling is capable of. To facilitate model understanding, this review focuses in three pandemic modelling aspects that are recently experimenting substantial innovations: parameterization and validation, economic aspects [26] and behaviour of the hosts [27]. Given the diversity of new techniques in these aspects of modelling, a review of common traits would be very helpful for non-expert users to determine which modelling techniques are most useful to address the decisions they face. In addition, a protocol to guide the reporting of these aspects together with model construction would help modellers and policy makers compare and evaluate models. To this end, we review and classify models for influenza pandemic preparedness from January 2000 to September 2011, and use the resulting analysis to develop a simple guiding protocol for reporting modelling decisions.\n\nWe searched Google Scholar, PubMed and ISI Web of Knowledge to identify articles focusing on influenza pandemic modelling to inform management strategies (see Additional file 1: Figure S1 in the electronic supplementary material (ESM) for a PRISMA flow diagram [28]). Our search criterion was: contains pandemic AND model* AND influenza AND policy OR policies. Our eligibility criteria were articles that: (i) were published in peer reviewed journals from January 2000 to September 2011; (ii) aimed to advise policy makers and made policy recommendations about pandemic influenza preparedness, mitigation or control; and (iii) employed mechanistic models to derive those insights. We further excluded cost-effectiveness and decision tree studies that did not incorporate disease transmission dynamics. The search in PubMed retrieved 72 articles, ISI Web of Knowledge 128, and Google Scholar 19,200 results. After an additional query refinement in Google Scholar (adding to the previous query the terms: AND preparedness OR strateg* AND simulation OR compartment*), screening of articles and further full-text assessment for their eligibility (Additional file 1: Figure S1 in ESM), 91 articles were selected for the analysis.\n\nWe classify models into several major groups: compartmental epidemic models, network models, agent-based models, metapopulation models, game theoretic models, optimal control models and partial or general computable equilibrium models (definitions of the models can be found in Table 1). In some instances models can conform to several categories: e.g. compartmental models combined with metapopulation models.\n\nIn addition to classifying the models, we evaluated traits common to several taxa consistent with the focus of the review on evaluating the trends in parameterization and validation, incorporation of economic aspects and host behaviour (Table 2). We evaluated capacity of the models to answer (i) epidemiological questions: for instance, how many people and which age groups were expected to become infected, hospitalized and die as a result of infection during the pandemic? To what extent would control and treatment interventions mitigate this impact?; (ii) health economic questions: what would be the economic impacts of the pandemic and which interventions would represent better value for money to reduce the health and economic impacts?; (iii) behavioural questions: would changes in the behaviour of the individuals during the pandemic influence the effectiveness of the interventions?\n\nTo classify models by their construction and validation techniques, we evaluated whether they (i) incorporated an assessment of the sensitivity of their results to model parameters and assumptions, (ii) were parameterized using parameters directly from other models, and (iii) were validated from empirical data. To that end, the articles were categorized according to the type of model used (Table 1), population heterogeneity level considered, parameterization procedure, consideration of economic impacts, inclusion of human behaviour and performance of validation or sensitivity analysis (see the ESM for a full list of the models and their characteristics).\n\nTo facilitate the systematization and comparison of models we develop a guiding protocol for reporting model general Characteristics, Construction, Parameterization and Validation aspects (CCPV protocol), derived from the results of the review. The protocol builds upon previous protocols to describe ABMs [31] and retains the description of technical aspects of the models that facilitate its understanding and reproduction, for instance describing the aim of the model, scale, structure, model type, dynamic aspects, initialization, data inputs, the way individuals and their interactions are considered or the inclusion of stochasticity (Table 3). The protocol was then extensively expanded to include aspects relative to models construction, parameterization, sensitivity analysis, verification and validation, incorporation of economics and host behaviour.\n\nThe prevalence of modelling for pandemic influenza has increased dramatically since 2000 (Figure 1B). Out of the 91 articles included in the review, more than half of the models were compartmental (58/91, 64%). Compartmental models were in some instances combined with a dynamic optimization framework (7/58, 12%) or game theory (2/58, 3%). Metapopulation models were employed in combination with both compartmental models and ABMs (9 and 3 models respectively). The second most common modelling approach were ABMs (22/91, 24%). The rest of the models were computable general equilibrium models (CGE) (3/91, 3%), network models (4/91, 4%) and household models (3/91, 3%) (Figure 1A).\n\nMost models that were applied to a specific geographic region focused on high-income countries. Very scarce were studies not focusing on high-income economies (5/91, 6% applied to upper-middle income countries like Thailand or Mexico and none applied exclusively to low-income or lower-middle income countries), despite the higher case fatality rate expected in those countries [32]. The majority of studies were not intended to study impact in specific, localised settings such as schools or hospitals and represented instead the national or international level. A few exceptions did, on the other hand, concentrate on the effects of school closures [4,6,33-37] and on hospitals or hospital staff [38-40].\n\nReporting the combination of data used for parameterization would allow model users to evaluate the reliability of the models, reduce the risk of model overfitting and allow assessing the adequacy of the parameter for a specific setting (Table 3 \u201cmodel parameterization\u201d). Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis are other ways to evaluate the influence of individual parameters and their uncertainty range on model predictions (Table 2). They can be used to direct data collection efforts and should ideally be reported (Table 3 \u201csensitivity and uncertainty analysis\u201d).\n\nReporting the underlying assumptions governing the model, as well as their justification, would help model users evaluate the structural validity of the model (Table 3 \u201ccharacteristics, theoretical basis\u201d). Validation processes will show if the models are oversimplified and do not capture the salient features of the pandemic. In addition, reporting structural and predictive validity together with subsequent structural changes (e.g. spatial explicitness) to models would allow policy makers to assess the reliability of model predictions, and other analysts to assess the robustness of model construction and parameterisation (Table 3 \u201cconstruction aspects, space\u201d and \u201cmodel validation\u201d). Further assistance in evaluating the validity of the model can be obtained through reporting model verification techniques, whether the model has been compared with simpler versions or with other models developed in parallel (Table 3 \u201cmodel verification\u201d and \u201ccomplexity\u201d).\n\nReporting the economic aspects considered in the model, the type of analysis employed, heterogeneity of impacts in different groups and disease burden metrics employed, would facilitate model users understanding the capabilities of the model and the adequacy of the economic analysis undertaken (Table 3, \u201cmodel construction, economic aspects\u201d).\n\nReporting of the assumptions on how behaviour is modelled would help model users interpreting model results. Reporting of comparisons of model results with and without behaviour would further facility the understanding of behaviour in the model (Table 3, \u201cconstruction aspects, behaviour\u201d).\n\nInfluenza pandemic models have, over the last decade, proliferated dramatically. In parallel to the rapid increase in the number of models, many now incorporate sophisticated parameterization and validation techniques, economic analyses and the behaviour of individuals. Techniques such as Bayesian inference, agent-based modelling and the application of game theory are being newly applied to influenza, answering a more diverse set of public health questions.\n\nThis increase in modelling diversity stems from an increase in diversity of research questions and policy strategies. Ultimately, however, the choices made in model construction will depend critically on the data available, the research question and the consideration of the trade-off between realism and interpretability of the model. Even though models need to be fit for purpose, it is noteworthy that many influenza pandemics models rely on parameters from previous modelling studies and are rarely validated using observed data.\n\nAlthough model validation is not expected in influenza pandemic modelling, it is considered a basic prerequisite for publication in other fields, such as the related discipline of ecological modelling. For instance, the editorial policy of the journal Ecological Modelling states: \u201cPapers that only present a model without support of ecological data for calibration and hopefully also validation of the model will not be accepted because a model has in most cases no interest before it has been held up to ecological reality\u201d [87], and a standardised ODD protocol (overview, design concepts, and details) for documenting ABMs more generally in that field has been published in the same journal [31,88]. Guidelines also exist in the fields of health economics. Examples are guidelines from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK [89], the Drummond Checklist that is required for economic submissions by the British Medical Journal [90], guidelines for cost-effectiveness analysis [91] and modelling guidelines from the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research [92].\n\nGiven the large variety in modelling approaches for influenza pandemic management and to facilitate comparison between models, we developed a simple general modelling Characteristics, Construction, Parameterization and Validation aspects (CCPV) reporting protocol (Table 3). The use of the protocol together with international data sharing mechanisms would facilitate comparability between models, transparency in decisions about the kinds of models to use, and ultimately increase the confidence in the use of modelling in formulating influenza pandemic policies.\n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interests.\n\nLRC, ARC made substantial contributions to conception and design.
