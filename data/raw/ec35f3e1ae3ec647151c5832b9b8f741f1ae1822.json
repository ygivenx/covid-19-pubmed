The lag of 5 days could be reflecting the mean period 148 between the clinical diagnostic and the death of seriously illness patients. The continuous line in 149 \n\nPossible patterns between temperature/relative humidity and the number of new infected cases are 156 explored next. Figure 3 .a shows the behavior of the daily confirmed cases (C t ) with respect to the 157 temperature (T t ). No discernible regular pattern between the daily confirmed cases and temperature 158 can be observed. The correlation coefficient is very low (\u03c1 = -0.18), reflecting weak negative trend. 159 Similar behavior was exhibited by the new cases with respect to the relative humidity (RH t ) in 160 In the face of this feature, a different strategy was pursued. A key observation is that the 168 meteorological variables showed large fluctuations along a secular trend (see Figure 1 ). Today 169 confirmed cases correspond to infected cases in past days. It has been reported that the incubation 170 period of COV-19 is typically 7-14 days, and could be as long as 27 days. In this regard, the effects 171 of temperature in today confirmed cases are not pointwise, but distributed along several past days. 172\n\nThat is, the dynamical behavior of today confirmed cases is likely to be affected by the temperature 173 trend in the past few days. The proposed strategy consists in considering the secular trend of the 174 temperature and relative humidity dynamics, and to search patterns with respect to lagged values. 175 6 .

That is, the increase of temperature was 182 accompanied by a decrease of the relative humidity. 183 The relatively high dispersion of the data points in Figure 5 .c for low temperature might be linked 239 to confounding factors, including precipitation, air pollution and improvements in medical facilities. 240\n\nHowever, a major effect of the meteorological temperature cannot be ruled out.
