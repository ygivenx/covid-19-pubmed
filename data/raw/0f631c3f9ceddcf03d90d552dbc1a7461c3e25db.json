{"title": "Supplemental Information Virus-and Interferon Alpha-Induced Transcriptomes of Cells from the Microbat Myotis daubentonii", "body": "Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Friedemann Weber (friedemann.weber@vetmed.uni-giessen.de).\n\nHuman lung A549 and the M. daubentonii kidney cell line MyDauNi/2c (Fuchs et al., 2017; Muller et al., 2012) were propagated in CCM-34 medium ( \n\nTotal cellular RNA was isolated at 6 h and at 24 h post infection (1.200.000 cells per condition and time point), approved for their integrity using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, and subjected to RNA deep sequencing. For each total RNA sample cDNA libraries were prepared utilizing the Illumina Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit for human/mouse/rat (hereafter rRNA-). Importantly, no polyA selection was applied.\n\nOverall, 18 rRNA-libraries were sequenced on six HiSeq 2500 lanes with 51 cycles resulting in 60-70 million strand-specific single-end reads per sample (Tab. S1). The complete experiment was performed in three independent, biological replicates. The raw read data was deposited in the GEO database under accession number GEO: GSE121301.\n\nSince no reference genome for M. daubentonii is publicly available, we downloaded the reference sequence and annotation of the closely related M. lucifugus from Ensembl (Myoluc2.0, release 86).\n\nReference sequences for the L, M, and S segment of RVFV were downloaded from the NCBI under RefSeq accessions NC014397.1, NC014395.1, and NC014396.1. The genomic sequence of M.\n\nlucifugus and the RVFV sequences were concatenated for mapping the RNA-Seq-derived short reads.\n\nPrior to mapping, all samples were quality checked with FastQC and quality trimmed with a Q20 threshold and a window size of length 4 using Prinseq (v0.20.3) (Schmieder and Edwards, 2011) . Reads shorter than 15 nt were discarded from the analysis. We used SortMeRNA (v2.1) (Kopylova et al., 2012) to detect and remove ribosomal RNAs, possibly still remaining after the ribosomal depletion step during cDNA library preparation. The quality-controlled and rRNA-depleted reads were mapped to the concatenated reference genomes of M. lucifugus and RVFV using STAR (v2.5.2) (Dobin and Gingeras, 2015) with an adjusted --outFilterScoreMinOverLread and --outFilterMatchNminOverLread of 0.4.\n\nTo check for possible contaminations in the RNA and the amount of viral reads in each sample, we used CLARK (v1.2.5) (Ounit et al., 2015) to classify the quality-checked reads against the NCBI RefSeq databases for viruses, bacteria, fungi, and human. We added the Ensembl M. lucifugus genome as a custom database and visualized the classification results of each sample with Krona (v2.7) (Ondov et al., 2011) .\n\nWe used blastx (v2.4.0+) against the Uniprot/SwissProt database created with the Trinotate pipeline (v3.0.2; https://trinotate.github.io/) to extend the Ensembl gene annotation of M. lucifugus. All blast hits that were considered as true positive hits had to meet an E-value threshold of 10 -4 , a sequence identity of at least 50% and an alignment length of at least 50%. If multiple hits for one sequence passed our filter settings, we selected the one with the best E-value. Based on this approach, we were able to assign a gene name and function to additional 4,844 sequences out of 7,101 CDS without a functional description in the Ensembl annotation for M. lucifugus. Additional homologous gene annotations were marked with a _<SPECIES> tag in the electronic supplement to distinguish between the original Ensembl annotation and our extension.\n\nBased on our strand-specific RNA-Seq data and with the help of our de novo assembly, we found various IFN genes to be annotated on the wrong strand in the Ensembl annotation of M. lucifugus. Therefore, these genes got initially zero read counts when estimating expression values with featureCounts (v1.5.0) (Liao et al., 2014) . To also take these genes into consideration, we adjusted the Ensembl annotation and changed the strand from '+' to '-' for the following gene IDs: ENSMLUG00000026947\n\nENSMLUG00000027612, ENSMLUG00000028931 (IFNW2_HORSE), ENSMLUG00000024850, ENSMLUG00000027376. Moreover, IRF7 was before not annotated at all in the M. lucifugus genome and had to be manually corrected. We calculated the position of IRF7 in the M. lucifugus genome based on our mapped reads and NCBI blast searches to finally add its annotation on contig AAPE02063415:16558-16759 on the minus strand. In addition, we identified ENSMLUG00000025338 as being ISG15.\n\nWe used featureCounts to quantify the mapped reads based on our extended and corrected Ensembl annotation (originally release 86) of M. lucifugus comprising 25,849 genes (19,728 coding for proteins).\n\nReads were counted strand-specific on exon level and accumulated per gene ID to obtain one count per gene. Only uniquely mapped reads were used in the differential gene expression analysis and further evaluations.\n\nThe read counts were passed to DESeq2 (v1.16.1) (Love et al., 2014) to call significantly ( We used various R packages for visualization and data assessment, comprising extended functionalities of the DESeq2 package such as principal component analyses, gene expression scatter plots and heat maps. We used the ReportingTools package (Huntley et al., 2013) to generate interactive web pages of significantly differential expressed genes and to build expression box plots for all genes and samples.\n\nGO term enrichment and visualization of the most significant regulated gene sets was performed with the Piano package (Varemo et al., 2013) . \n\nBased on a comparison of current de novo assembly tools for short-read RNA-Seq data (Holzer and Marz, 2019) , we used SPAdes in single-cell and RNA modus (v3.10.1) (Bankevich et al., 2012) , SOAPdenovo-trans (v1.03) (Xie et al., 2014) , and Trinity (v2.3.2) (Grabherr et al., 2011) to build a comprehensive transcriptome assembly for M. daubentonii. As input, the quality-checked reads of all 18 samples were used. All assembly tools were executed with default parameters and, if possible, in strandspecific mode. The resulting contigs of all tools were merged with CD-HIT-EST (v4.6; -c 0.95) (Fu et al., 2012) and the final assembly was used for homology searches and to confirm observations obtained from the M. lucifugus-based genome analyses. To investigate also (de novo) transcripts and isoforms differing between the conditions, triplicate samples were merged and assembled with Trinity only.\n\nWe Table. All data obtained were normalised against the 18S RNA signal using the ddCT method.\n\nTo confirm IFN competence and Ruxolitinib efficacy, cells infected and treated as indicated above were analysed by immunoblot with primary antibodies against phospho-Stat1, Stat1 and tubulin as indicated, and against Mx1 and RVFV N at 1:1000 and 1:2000, respectively.\n\nThe electronic supplement can be found at https://www.rna.uni-jena.de/supplements/mda/ comprising additional information about the RNA-Seq quality and read pre-processing, mapping statistics, PCA plots and videos, a read classification with Clark, GO term enrichment, full tables (including Excel) and further statistics for all differential expressed genes of each pairwise comparison, and coverage plots of the viral reads mapping to the S, L, and M segment of the RVFV reference genome. We used the DESeq2 results and the visualizations of the ReportingTools (Huntley et al., 2013) package to build an interactive gene observer (IGO), containing 1,448 genes that have a significant hit (q-value < 0.05) and an absolute fold change > 1 in at least one of the four "}
