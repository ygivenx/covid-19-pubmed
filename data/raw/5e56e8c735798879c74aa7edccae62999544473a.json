{"title": "Table 2). 4,5", "body": "depression in resident physicians. 13 We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies of depression, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation in undergraduate medical trainees.\n\nTwo authors (M.A.R. and D.A.M.) independently identified cross-sectional and longitudinal studies published prior to September 17, 2016 , that reported on the prevalence of depression, depressive symptoms, or suicidal ideation in medical students by systematically searching EMBASE, ERIC, MEDLINE, psycARTICLES, and psycINFO. In addition, the authors screened the reference lists of identified articles and corresponded with study investigators using the approaches implied by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guidelines. 14, 15 For the database searches, terms related to medical students and study design were combined with those related to depression and suicide without language restriction (complete details of the search strategy appear in eMethods 1 in the Supplement). Included studies (1) reported data on medical students, (2) were published in peer-reviewed journals, and (3) used a validated method to assess for depression, depressive symptoms, or suicidal ideation. 16 A third author (L.S.R.) resolved discrepancies by discussion and adjudication.\n\nThree authors (L.S.R., M.T., and J.B.S.) independently extracted the following data from each article using a standardized form: study design; geographic location; years of survey; year in school; sample size; average age of participants; number and percentage of male participants; diagnostic or screening method used; outcome definition (ie, specific diagnostic criteria or screening instrument cutoff); and reported prevalence estimates of depression, depressive symptoms, or suicidal ideation. Whether students who screened positive for depression sought psychiatric or other mental health treatment also was extracted. When there were studies involving the same population of students, only the most comprehensive or recent publication was included.\n\naccounted for between-study heterogeneity. 18 The same approach was used to estimate the summary percentage of students screening positive for depression who sought treatment. When studies reported point prevalence estimates made at different periods within the year, the overall period prevalence was used. Standard \u03c7 2 tests and the I 2 statistic (ie, the percentage of variability in prevalence estimates due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error, or chance, with values \u226575% indicating considerable heterogeneity) were used to assess between-study heterogeneity. 19, 20 Sensitivity analyses were performed by serially excluding each study to determine the influence of individual studies on the overall prevalence estimates. Results from studies grouped according to prespecified study-level characteristics were compared using stratified meta-analysis (for diagnostic criteria or screening instrument cutoff, study design, undergraduate level, continent or region, country, and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale components) or random-effects meta-regression (for year of baseline survey, age, and sex). 21, 22 To isolate associations within the medical school experience from associations with assessment tools, an analysis restricted to longitudinal studies reporting both pre-and intramedical school depressive symptom prevalence estimates was performed.\n\nBias secondary to small study effects was investigated using funnel plots and the Egger test. 23, 24 All analyses were performed using R version 3.2.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). 25 Statistical tests were 2-sided and used a significance threshold of P < .05.\n\nOne hundred ninety-five studies [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] involving a total of 129 123 individuals in 47 countries were included in the analysis ( Figure 1 ). The median number of participants per study was 336 (range, 44-10 140) . One hundred sixty-seven cross-sectional studies 2-4,6-9,11,26-184 (n = 116 628) and 16 longitudinal studies 10,196-210 (n = 5728) in 43 countries reported on depression or depressive symptom prevalence (Table 1) . Twenty-four cross-sectional studies (n = 21 002) in 15 countries reported on the prevalence of suicidal ideation (Table 2) . 4, 5, 34, 62, 65, 73, 74, 79, 112, 160, 165, 167, 174, [185] [186] [187] [188] [189] [190] [191] [192] [193] [194] [195] Medical student training level, continent or region, country, diagnostic criteria or screening instrument cutoff, and total Newcastle-Ottawa scores for the studies appear in eTable 1 in the Supplement. Newcastle-Ottawa score components for all 195 individual studies appear in eTable 2 in the Supplement. study, demonstrated that no individual study affected the overall prevalence estimate by more than 0.3% (eTable 3 in the Supplement).\n\nTo further characterize the range of depression or depressive symptom prevalence estimates identified by these methodologically diverse studies, meta-analyses stratified by screening instrument and cutoff score were conducted ( Figure 7 ). Summary prevalence estimates ranged from 9.3% ( \n\nNo statistically significant differences in prevalence estimates were noted between crosssectional studies ( (13 567/53 663; 25.4% [95% CI, 22 .8%-28.2%]) (Q = 9.6, P = .002; Figure 9 ). There were no statistically significant differences in prevalence estimates when studies were stratified by sample size, respondent and nonrespondent comparability, validity of ascertainment of depression or depressive symptoms (details regarding determination of screening instrument validity appear in eMethods 2 in the Supplement), thoroughness of descriptive statistics reporting, or total Newcastle-Ottawa score (P > .05 for all comparisons).\n\nTo identify potential sources of heterogeneity independent of assessment modality, heterogeneity was examined within subgroups of studies using common instruments when at least 6 studies were available (complete results appear in eTable 4 in the Supplement). No significant differences between cross-sectional and longitudinal studies were observed within any instruments when at least 3 studies were in each comparator subgroup.\n\nHeterogeneity was partially accounted for by country with US studies yielding lower depression or depressive symptom prevalence estimates than non-US studies among the 24 studies using the BDI and a cutoff score of 10 or greater (13.0% vs 37.5%, respectively; Q = 12.7, P < .001) and the 13 studies using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and a cutoff score of 16 or greater (34.4% vs 50.3%; Q = 3.8, P = .05). However, this difference was not seen among other instruments.\n\nLevel of training did not significantly contribute to between study heterogeneity among any of the examined instruments. Year of baseline survey significantly contributed to observed statistical heterogeneity among 3 instruments, although the results were inconsistent (ie, 2 analyses suggested that depression was increasing with time, whereas a third suggested it was decreasing). Age and sex were not significantly associated with depression prevalence among any instruments.\n\nThe temporal relationship between exposure to medical school and depressive symptoms was assessed in an analysis of 9 longitudinal studies that measured depressive symptoms before and during medical school (Table 3) . Because studies used different assessment instruments, the relative change in depressive symptoms was calculated for each study individually (ie, follow-up prevalence divided by baseline prevalence) and then the relative changes derived from the individual studies were examined. Overall, the median absolute increase in depressive symptoms was 13.5% (range, 0.6%-35.3%) following the onset of medical training.\n\nIn an analysis of 24 studies, the crude summary prevalence of suicidal ideation, variably reported as having occurred over the past 2 weeks to the past 12 months, was 11.1% (2043/21 002 individuals; 95%CI, 9.0%-13.7%), with significant evidence of between-study heterogeneity (Q = 547.1, \u03c4 2 = 0.32, I 2 = 95.8%, P < .001) ( Figure 10 ). The prevalence estimates reported by the individual studies ranged from 4.9% to 35.6%. Sensitivity analysis showed that no individual study affected the overall pooled estimate by more than 1.9% (eTable 5 in the Supplement).\n\nTo further characterize the range of the suicidal ideation prevalence estimates identified, stratified meta-analyses were performed by screening instrument and cutoff score. Summary prevalence estimates ranged from 7.4% (69/938 individuals [95% CI, .2%]; Q = 0.01, \u03c4 2 = 0, I 2 = 0%) over the past 2 weeks for studies using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to 24.2% (208/754 individuals [95% CI, 13 .0%-40.5%]; Q = 37.2, \u03c4 2 = 0.42, I 2 = 94.6%) over the past 12 months for studies using the 28-item General Health Questionnaire.\n\nThe median prevalence of suicidal ideation over the past 12 months reported by 7 studies using variably worded short-form screening instruments was 10.2% (723/8636 individuals [95% CI, 6.8%-15.0%]; Q = 176.5, \u03c4 2 = 0.33, I 2 = 96.6%). Among the full set of studies, no statistically significant differences in prevalence estimates were noted by country (United States vs other countries), continent or region, level of training, baseline survey year, average age, proportion of male study participants, or total Newcastle-Ottawa score (P > .05 for all comparisons). Within-instrument heterogeneity was not examined because there were not enough studies using identical screening instruments (\u22644 for each assessment modality), precluding meaningful analysis.\n\nVisual inspection of the funnel plot of studies reporting on depression or depressive symptoms revealed significant asymmetry (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). There was evidence of publication bias, with smaller studies yielding more extreme prevalence estimates (P = .001 using the Egger test). The funnel plot of studies reporting on suicidal ideation revealed minimal asymmetry (eFigure 3 in the Supplement), suggesting the absence of significant publication bias (P = .49 using the Egger test).\n\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis of 195 studies involving 129 123 medical students in 47 countries demonstrated that 27.2% (range, 9.3%-55.9%) of students screened positive for depression and that 11.1% (range, 7.4%-24.2%) reported suicidal ideation during medical school. Only 15.7% of students who screened positive for depression reportedly sought treatment. These findings are concerning given that the development of depression and suicidality has been linked to an increased short-term risk of suicide as well as a higher long-term risk of future depressive episodes and morbidity. 211, 212 The present analysis builds on recent work demonstrating a high prevalence of depression among resident physicians, and the concordance between the summary prevalence estimates (27.2% in students vs 28.8% in residents) suggests that depression is a problem affecting all levels of medical training. 13, 213 Taken together, these data suggest that depressive and suicidal symptoms in medical trainees may adversely affect the long-term health of physicians as well as the quality of care delivered in academic medical centers. [214] [215] [216] When interpreting these findings, it is important to recognize that the data synthesized in this study were almost exclusively derived from self-report inventories of depressive symptoms that varied substantially in their sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing major depressive disorder (eTable 6 in the Supplement). 217 Instruments such as the PHQ-9 have high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing major depression, whereas others such as the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) have low specificity and should be viewed as screening tools. Although these self-report measures of depressive symptoms have limitations, they are essential tools for accurately measuring depression in medical trainees because they protect anonymity in a manner that is not possible through formal diagnostic interviews. 218 To control for the differences in these inventories, we stratified our analyses by survey instrument and cutoff score, identifying a range of estimates not captured in another evidence synthesis. 219 The prevalence of depressive symptoms among medical students in this study was higher than that reported in the general population. [220] [221] [222] For example, the National Institute of Mental Health study of behavioral health trends in the United States, including 67 500 nationally representative participants, found that the 12-month prevalence of a major depressive episode was 9.3% among 18-to 25-yearolds and 7.2% among 26-to 49-yearolds. 220 In contrast, the BDI, CES-D, and PHQ-9 summary estimates obtained in the present study were between 2.2 and 5.2 times higher than these estimates. These findings suggest that depressive symptom prevalence is substantially higher among medical students than among individuals of similar age in the general population.\n\nHow depression levels in medical students compare with those in nonmedical undergraduate students and professional students is unclear. One review concluded that depressive symptom prevalence did not statistically differ between medical students and nonmedical undergraduate students. 223 However, this conclusion may be confounded because the analysis did not control for assessment modality and did not include a comprehensive or representative set of studies (only 12 studies and 4 studies exclusively composed of medical students and nonmedical students, respectively). Two large, representative epidemiological studies have estimated that depressive symptom prevalence in nonmedical students ranges from 13.8% to 21.0%, lower than the estimates reported by many studies of medical students in the present meta-analysis. 224, 225 Some professional students, such as law students, may not markedly differ from medical students in their susceptibility to depression, although firm conclusions cannot be drawn from the currently available data. 226, 227 Together, these findings suggest that factors responsible for depression in medical students may also be operative in other undergraduate and professional schools. The finding in the longitudinal analysis of an increase in depressive symptom prevalence with the onset of medical school suggests that it is not just that medical students (and other students) are prone to depression, but that the school experience may be a causal factor. This analysis identified a pooled prevalence of suicidal ideation of 11.1%. Endorsement of suicidal ideation as assessed by the PHQ-9 or other similar instruments increases the cumulative risk of a suicide attempt or completion over the next year by 10-and 100-fold, respectively. 228 Combined with the finding that only 15.7%of medical students who screened positive for depression sought treatment, the high prevalence of suicidal ideation underscores the need for effective preventive efforts and increased access to care that accommodate the needs of medical students and the demands of their training.\n\nThis study has important limitations. First, the data were derived from studies that had different designs, screening instruments, and trainee demographics. The substantial heterogeneity among the studies remained largely unexplained by the variables inspected. Second, many subgroup analyses relied on unpaired cross-sectional data collected at different medical schools, which may cause confounding. Third, because the studies were heterogeneous with respect to screening inventories and student populations, the prevalence of major depression could not be determined. Fourth, the analysis relied on aggregated published data. A multicenter, prospective study using a single validated measure of depression and suicidal ideation with structured diagnostic interviews in a random subset of participants would provide a more accurate estimate of the prevalence of depression and suicidal ideation among medical students.\n\nBecause of the high prevalence of depressive and suicidal symptomatology in medical students, there is a need for additional studies to identify the root causes of emotional distress in this population. To provide more relevant information, future epidemiological studies should consider adopting prospective study designs so that the same individuals can be assessed over time, use commonly used screening instruments with valid cutoffs for assessing depression in the community (eg, the BDI, CES-D, or PHQ-9), screen for comorbid anxiety disorders, and completely and accurately report their data, for example, by closely following the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. 229 Possible causes of depressive and suicidal symptomatology in medical students likely include stress and anxiety secondary to the competitiveness of medical school. 62 Restructuring medical school curricula and student evaluations (such as using a pass-fail grading schema rather than a tiered grading schema and fostering collaborative group learning through a \"flipped-classroom\" education model) might ameliorate these stresses. 230, 231 Future research should also determine how strongly depression in medical school predicts depression during residency and whether interventions that reduce depression in medical students carry over in their effectiveness when those students transition to residency. 232 Furthermore, efforts are continually needed to reduce barriers to mental health services, including addressing the stigma of depression. 146, 233 \n\nIn this systematic review, the summary estimate of the prevalence of depression or depressive symptoms among medical studentswas27.2%andthatof suicidal ideationwas11.1%. Further research is needed to identify strategies for preventing and treating these disorders in this population. (10) \n\nAre medical students at high risk for depression and suicidal ideation?\n\nIn this meta-analysis, the overall prevalence of depression or depressive symptoms among medical students was 27.2%, and the overall prevalence of suicidal ideation was 11.1%. Among medical students who screened positive for depression, 15.7% sought psychiatric treatment.\n\nThe overall prevalence of depressive symptoms among medical students in this study was higher than that reported in the general population, which underscores the need for effective preventive efforts and increased access to care for medical students. \n\nThe "}
