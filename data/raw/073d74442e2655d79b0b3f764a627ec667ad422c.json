{"title": "Quantifying SARS-CoV-2 transmission suggests epidemic control with digital contact tracing", "body": "Environmental transmission: transmission via contamination, and specifically in a way that would not typically be attributable to contact with the source in a contact survey (i.e., this does not include transmission pairs who were in extended close contact, but for whom in reality the infectious dose passed via the environment instead of more directly). These could be identified in an analysis of spatial movements.\n\nWe acknowledge that boundaries between these categories may be blurred, but defined broadly these categories have different implications for prevention, responding differently to classical measures of case isolation and quarantining contacts (9) (10) (and for a specific application to COVID-19 see below (11)).\n\nEvidence exists for each of these routes of transmission: symptomatic (12), pre-symptomatic (13) ; asymptomatic (14) ; and environmental (12). For prevention, the crucial information is the relative frequency of different routes of transmission so as to allocate finite resources between different intervention strategies.\n\nWe used the exponential growth rate of the epidemic, r, from the early stages of the epidemic in China, such that the effect of control measures discussed later will be relative to the early stages of an outbreak, exemplified by baseline contact patterns and environmental conditions in Hubei during that period. We note that this assumption is implicit in many estimates of R0. The epidemic doubling time T2 is equal to loge(2) / r. We used the value r = 0.14 per day (20) , corresponding to a doubling time of 5.0 days.\n\nThe incubation period is defined as the time between infection and onset of symptoms. It is estimated as the time between exposure and report of noticeable symptoms. We used the incubation period distribution calculated by (21) . The distribution is lognormal with mean 5.5 days, median 5.2 days and standard deviation 2.1 days, and is included with our results in Fig. 1 .\n\nThe generation time is defined for source-recipient transmission pairs as the time between the infection of the source and the infection of the recipient. Because time of infection is generally not known, the generation time is often approximated by the serial interval, which is defined as the time between the onset of symptoms of the source and the onset of symptoms of the recipient. We did not take that approach here; instead, we directly estimated the generation time distribution from 40 source-recipient pairs. These pairs were manually selected according to high confidence of direct transmission inferred from publicly available sources at the time of writing (March, 2020), and with known time of onset of symptoms for both source and recipient. We combined dates of symptom onset with intervals of exposure for both source and recipient (when available) and the above distribution of incubation times and from these inferred the distribution of generation times. The distribution is best described by a Weibull distribution (AIC=148.4, versus 149.9 for gamma and 152.3 for lognormal distribution) with mean and median equal to 5.0 days and standard deviation of 1.9 days, shown in the left panel of Fig. 1 .

Uncertainty in the fit of the distribution is shown in Fig. S1 . Our distribution is robust with respect to the choice of transmission events (Fig. S2) . Correlation in the uncertainty between the inferred mean and standard deviation is shown in Fig. S3 . The distribution of serial intervals for these pairs is shown in Fig. S4 . The countries from which the transmission pair data was obtained are shown in Fig. S5 .\n\nFor each of the 40 transmission pairs we estimated the posterior probability that transmission was presymptomatic, i.e., occurred before the onset of symptoms in the infector. We used a Bayesian approach with an uninformative prior (transmission before or after symptoms equally likely). The 40 probabilities inferred are shown in the right panel of Fig. 1 ; the mean probability is 37% (95% CI:\n\n27.5% -45%), which can be interpreted as the fraction of pre-symptomatic transmission events out of pre-symptomatic plus symptomatic transmission events. This mean probability over all pairs approximates our prior, but the bimodal distribution of individual probabilities in Fig. 1 shows that these are typically far from the prior, i.e., the data are strongly informative. Uncertainty in the value of this fraction is shown in We decompose ( ) into four contributions that reflect our categorization above, namely asymptomatic transmission, pre-symptomatic transmission, symptomatic transmission, and environmental transmission. The area under the curve of one of these contributions gives the mean total number of transmissions over one full infection, via that route -asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, symptomatic or environmental -which we define to be RA, RP, RS and RE respectively. The sum of these is R0.\n\nThe mathematical form for ( ) is: s( ) is the infectiousness of an individual currently either symptomatic or pre-symptomatic, at ageof-infection . Other parameters in this expression, and those feeding into it indirectly, are listed in Table 1 . A detailed discussion of this expression including its assumptions is found in the By drawing input parameter sets from the uncertainties shown in Table 1 , we quantified our uncertainty in R0 and its four contributions.

This corresponds to the of (9) in the case where there is only pre-symptomatic and symptomatic transmission. From Table 2 We developed our mathematical model of infectiousness into a web application where users can test the effect of alternative parameter combinations (25).\n\nWe modelled the combined impact of two interventions: (i) isolation of symptomatic individuals, and (ii) tracing the contacts of symptomatic cases and quarantining them. These interventions aim to stop the spread of the virus by reducing the number of transmissions from both symptomatic individuals and from their contacts (who may not be symptomatic), while minimizing the impact on the larger population. In practice, neither intervention will be successful or possible for 100% of individuals.\n\nThe success rate of these interventions determines the long-term evolution of the epidemic. If the success rates are high enough, the combination of isolation and contact tracing/quarantining could bring R below 1 and therefore effectively control the epidemic.\n\nAn analytical mathematical framework for the combined impact of these two interventions on an epidemic was previously derived in (9).

Our results are shown in Fig. 3 . The black line shows the threshold for epidemic control: combined success rates in the region to the upper right of the black line are sufficient to reduce R to less than one. The x axis is the success rate of case isolation, which can be thought of either as the fraction of symptomatic individuals isolated, assuming perfect prevention of transmission on isolation, or the degree to which infectiousness of symptomatic individuals is reduced assuming all of them are isolated. The y axis is the success rate of contact tracing; similarly, this can be thought of as the fraction of all contacts traced, assuming perfectly successful quarantine upon tracing, or the degree to which infectiousness of contacts is reduced assuming all of them are traced. These results for intervention effectiveness, and their dependence on all parameters in our combined analysis, can be explored through the same involves the minimum imposition possible and that decisions in policy and practice are guided by three moral values: equal moral respect, fairness, and the importance of reducing suffering (28) . It is noteworthy that the algorithmic approach we propose avoids the need for coercive surveillance, since the system can have very large impacts and achieve sustained epidemic suppression, even with partial uptake. People should be democratically entitled to decide whether to adopt this platform. The intention is not to impose the technology as a permanent change to society, but we believe it is under these pandemic circumstances it is necessary and justified to protect public health.\n\nIn this study, we estimated key parameters of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, using an analytically solvable model of the exponential phase of spread and of the impact of interventions. Our estimate of R0 is lower than many previous published estimates, for example (12), (29), (30). These studies assumed SARS-like generation times; however, the emerging evidence for shorter generation times for COVID-19 implies a smaller R0. This means a smaller fraction of transmissions need to be blocked for sustained epidemic suppression (R < 1). However, it does not mean sustained epidemic suppression will be easier to achieve because each individual's transmissions occur in a shorter window of time after their infection, and a greater fraction of them occurs before the warning sign of symptoms. Specifically, our approaches suggest that between a third and a half of transmissions occur from pre-symptomatic individuals. This is in line with estimates of 48% of transmission being presymptomatic in Singapore and 62% in Tianjin, China (31), and 44% in transmission pairs from various countries (32). Our infectiousness model suggests that the total contribution to R0 from presymptomatics is 0.9 (0.2 -1.1), almost enough to sustain an epidemic on its own. For SARS, the corresponding estimate was almost zero (9), immediately telling us that different containment strategies will be needed for COVID-19.\n\nTransmission occurring rapidly and before symptoms, as we have found, implies that the epidemic is highly unlikely to be contained by solely isolating symptomatic individuals.

Using mobile phones to measure infectious disease contact networks has been proposed previously (34-36). Considering our quantification of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we suggest that this approach, with a mobile phone App implementing instantaneous contact tracing, could reduce transmission enough to achieve R < 1 and sustained epidemic suppression, stopping the virus from spreading further. We have developed a web interface to explore the uncertainty in our modelling assumptions (25). This will also serve as an ongoing resource as new data becomes available and as the epidemic evolves.\n\nWe included environmentally mediated transmission and transmission from asymptomatic individuals in our general mathematical framework. However, the relative importance of these transmission routes remain speculative based on current data. Cleaning and decontamination are being deployed to varying levels in different settings, and improved estimates of their relative importance would help inform this as a priority. Asymptomatic infection has been widely reported for COVID-19, e.g., (14) , unlike for SARS where this was very rare (37). We argue that the reports from Singapore imply that even if asymptomatic infections are common, onward transmission from this state is probably uncommon, since forensic reconstruction of the transmission networks has closed down most missing links. There is an important caveat to this: the Singapore outbreak to date is small and has not implicated children. There has been widespread speculation that children could be frequent asymptomatic carriers and potential sources of SARS-CoV-2 (38,39).\n\nWe calibrated our estimate of the overall amount of transmission based on the epidemic growth rate observed in China not long after the epidemic started. Growth in Western European countries so far appears to be faster, implying either shorter intervals between individuals becoming infected and transmitting onwards, or a higher R0. We illustrate the latter effect in Figs S18 and S19. If this is an accurate picture of viral spread in Europe and not an artefact of early growth, epidemic control with only case isolation and quarantining of traced contacts appears implausible in this case, requiring the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.08.20032946 doi: medRxiv preprint This paper Suggestion from (19) All rights reserved.
