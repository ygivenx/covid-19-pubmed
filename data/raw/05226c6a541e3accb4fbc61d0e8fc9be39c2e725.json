{"title": "The Journal for Nurse Practitioners -JNP 1 Editorial", "body": "A s nurse practitioners (NPs), we are prepared to handle almost any clinical problem that comes our way and know to whom to refer if we are unsure. NPs are now at the forefront of health care. People trust nurses and NPs. Patients as well as neighbors, friends, acquaintances, and strangers look to us because we listen, approach health and illness holistically, and bring a foundation of nursing to everything we do. The world is changing rapidly, but can we keep up? Are we ready?\n\nWe are aware of many of the manifestations and potential consequences of climate change, such as increased respiratory, cardiac, and kidney conditions, food and water insecurity, heat stress, and waterborne and vector-borne illnesses, among others. 1,2 Do you know how to recognize a condition that may be impacted by climate change? Do you routinely assess your patients for health consequences of climate change? Would you know how to treat them?\n\nEarthquakes, erupting volcanoes, and flooding seem to be more frequent and devastating. Years ago, in California, I experienced an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.9. I never thought it was possible, but I actually watched the kitchen floor roll like an ocean wave. I quickly moved my 4 young children under our heavy German-made table, where we experienced multiple violent aftershocks. For several days, not even the birds made a sound. Our main concern was fresh food and water, because we lost all electricity and power. It hit me that many people live every day with these concerns.\n\nAs global warming continues and we become a more global economy and society, we are experiencing epidemics and pandemics that spread quickly. The avian influenza, Zika virus disease, Ebola, and COVID-19 make worldwide news, but what about the diseases that do not get as much press but might be equally virulent and possibly deadly? Experts on the influenza epidemic of 1918 report that it is likely we will experience something similar on a global scale, but no one knows when. 3 We must anticipate and prepare for global infection by being proactive rather than reactive.\n\nThere are other potential large-scale problems in addition to climate change and global health care crises. Many world leaders now have the capability of launching nuclear weapons without warning. Those of us in health care will need to be ready to help the survivors. I was recently asked to meet with nuclear engineer faculty at my university. They asked me whether we are preparing future nurses to know what to look for and how to care for people in a nuclear emergency.\n\nNurses have always been first responders. Emergency readiness and disaster preparedness are not new to nurses or NPs, but are we preparing for the future and threats to our health that are hard to even contemplate?\n\nThese are not pleasant thoughts, but it is important we consider them as we face the future of health care. Talk to your agency and ask them about their plans. Ask them and our professional organizations to provide education specific to handling the health impacts of climate change, global infection, and nuclear disaster. Our patients and the public count on us for expert care and comfort. We never let them down."}
