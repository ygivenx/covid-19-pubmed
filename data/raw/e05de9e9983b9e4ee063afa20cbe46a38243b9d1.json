{"title": "", "body": "Subjective knowledge about EVD was assessed using three items adapted from Jaccard et compute an average score so that higher scores would indicate higher unrealistic optimism.\n\nFinally, participants also reported on their personal control: \"If I was exposed to the Ebola virus, \n\nTo compare the association between actual knowledge and subjective knowledge about EVD with several risk perceptions, our first strategy was to enter both types of knowledge as predictors in multiple regression analyses with each risk perception variable as the outcome.\n\nHowever, as shown in Table 3 , bivariate correlations revealed that actual and subjective knowledge were highly correlated (r = 0.52). Although this positive and significant correlation is not surprising (1), its size could raise a multicollinearity concern. For that reason, we rather treated both types of knowledge as an outcome and used all the other risk perception variables as predictors. It is noteworthy that both analytical strategies led to the same key findings.\n\nLikewise, because personal control and unrealistic optimism were highly correlated (r = 0.52), these variables were averaged to reflect positive illusions and entered as such in the regression models.\n\nA complementary analysis was conducted to estimate the respective contribution of positive illusions and subjective knowledge to behavioral intentions. For that purpose, we regressed behavioral intentions on both variables (while controlling for the other risk perceptions). Results are described in Table 4 below. Results indicated that positive illusions (b = 0.22, p = 0.008) and subjective knowledge (b = 0.16, p = 0.046) were both positively associated with behavioral intentions (AdjR 2 = 0.38, p < 0.001). In other words, participants seem to be willing to engage in protective behaviors when they think they are knowledgeable enough and when they overestimate their capabilities to protect themselves against EVD.\n\nThe present study is correlational, which prevents any causal inference. Another limitation could be that most our respondents planned to travel to countries not affected by EVD.\n\nThe findings could thus not generalize to those traveling to affected countries. One might indeed reason that travelers who plan to travel to an affected country would be more concerned by EVD and thus display higher levels of actual knowledge. However, even higher levels of actual knowledge and/or greater relevance of the situation are unlikely to change the overall pattern of results for several reasons. First, controlling for the destination country did not change the present results. Second, given the independent effects of actual and subjective knowledge showed here and in previous research (1), it is quite unlikely that higher levels of actual knowledge would change the overall pattern of results. Third, previous research (2) has shown that even highly concerned individuals like healthcare workers traveling to Ebola camps in Africa, who indeed displayed higher (average) levels of actual knowledge, were not immune to risk misperceptions: they underestimated their likelihood for contracting Ebola compared to their colleagues and, despite their high-risk status, they showed little concern about contracting Ebola during their mission. Finally, it is still informative to discover that despite intensive media coverage of the epidemic (as it was the case in France and other non affected countries), many people display a lack of knowledge and misperceptions about EVD (5), which could be important factors of dissemination in case of imported disease."}
