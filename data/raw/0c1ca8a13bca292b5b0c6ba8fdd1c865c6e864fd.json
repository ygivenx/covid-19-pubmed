{"title": "Comparative sequence analysis of a polymorphic region of the spike glycoprotein $1 subunit of enteric bovine coronavirus isolates", "body": "Bovine coronavirus (BCV) is an important cause of acute enteritis in newborn calves [18] . Some recent reports suggest that BCV is also responsible for upper respiratory tract illness in growing calves [22, 24] , winter dysentery (hemorrhagic enteritis) or chronic shedding in adult cattle [2, 25] . The viral particle is mostly spherical, enveloped with a diameter of around 100 nm, and displays two fringes of surface projections [28, 31] . The viral genome consists of a large singlestranded RNA with positive polarity, approximately 30 Kb in length [31] , and encodes four major structural proteins which are the phosphonucleoprotein The cell culture-adapted Mebus strain [18] of BCV was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC VR-874), Rockville, MD. This prototype BCV strain was originally isolated in bovine fetal kidney cells from diarrhea fluid of calf [ 18] . Viral isolates BCQ 9, BCQ 571, BCQ 20 and BCQ 2070 were recovered during winter 1989 from clinical cases of epidemic diarrhea in newborn calves affecting Qu6bec dairy herds located in four different geographic areas [19] . No commercial BCV vaccine had been applied in these herds during the year preceeding the emergence of clinical cases. The various Qu6bec BCV isolates could be differentiated serologically by indirect immunofluorescence, hemagglutination-inhibition, seroneutralization and competitive ELISA tests using Mabs directed against the S protein of the prototype Mebus strain [19] . For the present studies, the BCV strains were passaged not more than five times in human rectal tumor (HRT-18) cells in the presence of 10 U/ml of bovine pancreatic trypsin [8] . The extracellular virons were purified from the supernatants of infected cell cultures by differential and isopycnic ultracentrifugation on sucrose gradients as previously described [8] .\n\nViral RNA was extracted following the guanidinium isothiocyanate-acid phenol method [4] . Briefly, 100 gl of purified virus was resuspended and vortexed vigorously in 500 gl of solution D (4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate, 0.75 M sodium citrate, 0.5~o Sarkosyl and 0.1 M 2-mercaptoethanol). After acid phenol treatment, the aqueous phase was removed and RNA was precipitated with isopropanol. The RNA pellets were washed with 75~ ethanol, dissolved in 20 lal RNase-free water, and stored at -70 \u00b0C.\n\nThe oligonucleotide primers used in the RT-PCR assay were chose on the basis of the previously published sequence for the Mebus strain of BCV [-1], EMBL/Gen Bank accession No. M 31053. The primers were: oligo Sls (5'TGCTATACCGAATGGTAGG 3') complementary to a sequence at positions 1185-1203 on the S gene and oligo Slas (5'GTAAACCGATAACCAGTGG 3') corresponding to antisense of the sequence at position 2315-2333 on the S gene. This amplification primer pair flanks a 1146-nucleotide gene fragment (SIB) encoding most neutralizing epitopes and the proteolytic cleavage site [34, 36] . In order to clone the PCR products using the CloneAmp system (GIBCO BRL, Gaithersburg, MD), the following sequences were incorporated into the 5' end of each amplification primer: Sn 5'-CUA CUA CUA CUA-3', and Asn 5'-CAU CAU CAU CAU-Y. Oligonucleotide syntheses and incorporation of dTMP into 5' termini were carried out on an automated DNA synthesizer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Baie d'Urf~, QC, Canada).\n\nPrior to PCR amplification, the target RNA was converted to a cDNA by use of reverse transcriptase (RT) and Slas primer. The RT reaction contained 2 gl of 10X PCR buffer (500mM KC1, 100raM Tris-HC1 (prig), 15mM MgC12, and 1~ Triton X-100), lpl containing 20 units of RNA guard (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), 2 gl of 10 mM each dNTP, 2 gl of 25 mM MgC12, 1 gl of 50 pmol antisense primer, and 2-5 gl of the extracted viral RNA. A 20-gl total reaction volume was obtained by adding sterile DEPC-treated distilled water. After heating to 94 \u00b0C for 1 min and 65 \u00b0C for 5 min, 20 units MuLV RT were added (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The mixture was incubated 60 min at 42 \u00b0C, and the RT reaction was stopped by heating to 95 \u00b0C for 5 min and stored at -20 \u00b0C.\n\nA volume of 80 gl of the PCR reaction mix was added to 20 gl of the cDNA mix such that the final 100 pl volume contained 10 mM Tris-HC1 (pH 8.3), 50 mM KC1, 2.5 mM MgCt2, 0.01~ gelatin, 50pmol of Sls and Slas primers and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (BIO 101, La Jolla, CA, U.S.A.). After overlaying with 100 gl of mineral oil, amplification was carried out in a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin Elmer) with the following cycling program: 94 \u00b0C denaturation for 1 min, 60 \u00b0C annealing for 1 rain, and 72 \u00b0C elongation for 2 min. A total of 35 cycles was performed, the final polymerisation step was at 74 \u00b0C for 10 min. Following amplification, 5 gl of the final product was analyzed on a 0.8~o agarose gel in TBE buffer (0.089 M Tris-HC1, (pH 8.3), 0.089 M boric acid, and 2 mM EDTA) and stained with ethidium bromide. \n\nThe PCR products were ligated into the pAMP 1 vector using the CloneAmp system (GIBCO BRL). The ligation mixture was used to transform competent cells E. coli DH5e (GIBCO BRL) following the manufacturer's direction.\n\nDNA sequencing was performed by the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method [26] , following the procedure outlined in the instruction of T7 sequencing kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Sequences of the additional primers used for sequencing the SIB fragment were: 5'-CGTGTAAATTGGATG-3', 5'-GTTGGCAAGTACAAG-3', 5'-AATCCTTGTACTTGC-3', 5'-GTTAAGTAGTCTCTA-3', 5'-AATTTACACGGACAG-3' and 5'-TAGAGACTA-CTTAAC-Y. To assess the error rate of the reverse transcriptase and TaqDNA polymerase, clones from different cDNA synthesis and PCR events were sequenced. Errors generated by T7 polymerase were avoided by sequencing clones in both DNA strands and directions. Sequences were analysed by the computer programs, \n\nThe nucleotide sequence accession numbers (EMBL/GeneBank/DDBJ) are as follows: U06090 for BCQ-2070; U06093 for BCQ-571; U06092 for BCQ-20; and U06091 for BCQ-9.\n\nThe complete S1B nucleotide (nt) and deduced amino acid (aa) sequences of the four clinical BCV isolates were aligned and compared (Figs. 1 and 2). Each S1B gene fragment is 1146 bp long encoding the antigenic domain II identified within aa residues 517 to 720 [36] , the polymorphic region located between aa residues 456 and 592 [36] , and the proteolytic cleavage site beginning with aa 763 [-1, 36] . The degree of homology and sequence conservation in the nucleotide and deduced aa sequences of the S1B gene fragment were analysed using a microcomputer program GeneWorks. The isolates BCQ-2070, BCQ-9 and BCQ-571 possessed at least 98~o nt sequence identity in paired comparisons. However, nt sequence of the S1B gene fragment of BCQ-20 was only 96~ conserved and, thus, was the most distantly related. These sequences demonstrated a high degree of similarity, and the only variations observed consisted of point mutations that apparently not occurred at random. Fifty percent of the nucleotide substitutions were located in the third positions of the respective codons and therefore represent translationally silent mutations. This resulted in only thirteen aa changes among the four isolates. The most similar deduced aa sequences were those of BCV-2070 and BCV-571 or BCV-2070 and BCV-9 (5 aa differences) in paired comparisons, and the most distant were those of BCV-571 and BCV-9 (10 aa differences). Four potential N-linked glycosylation sites were predicted in cases of the S1B fragment of the four Qu6bec BCV isolates, these glycosylation sites being located downstream the polymorphic .............................................

Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of the S1B gene fragment of four Qu6bec BCV isolates, BCQ-2070, BCQ-571, BCQ-20, and BCQ-9; and two reference strains, BCV-MEB [1] , and BCV-F15 [3] . The polymorphic region (aa residues 456 to 592) is written in bold face, the proteolytic cleavage site (aa residues 663 to 767) is underlined and the potential N-linked glycosylation sites are double underlined. The sequence of reference strain BCV-MEB is written in full, while only changes in amino acid residues are indicated for the sequences of the other strains region and antigenic domain II. Twenty-six cysteine residues were conserved among all of the Qu6bec isolates.\n\nAs illustrated in Fig. 1 , the complete S1B nt sequences of the four Qu6bec clinical BCV isolates were aligned and compared with the homologous sequences of the Mebus (BCV-MEB) and F15 (BCV-F 15) reference strains. The level of nt sequence identity between the S1B fragments of the four Qu6bec BCV isolates and that from BCV-MEB and BCV-F15 strains was 97~ and 96~o, respectively. In contrast, the polymorphic region (nt 168-576) seemed to be more conserved among the Qu6bec BCV isolates and BCV-F15 (97~o). Frameshift, deletion, or insertion, and non sense mutations were not observed; the only variations among these sequences consisted of 40 nt substitutions, which represented 4~o of the sequence. The differing nucleotides were not distributed randomly over the entire sequence but rather were clustered in the polymorphic region. This was also reflected in the deduced aa sequences (Fig. 2) . The 60 aa residues immediately upstream the polymorphic region were almost completely conserved among all the isolates. However, 12 aa substitutions were found between residues 456 and 592 of the polymorphic region. The fact, that these aa changes occurred in almost identical location suggests these differences may be significant. The 29 aa residues (aa 593 to 621) immediately downstream the hypervariable region have been shown to be part of the antigenic domain II which is recognized by neutralizing Mabs BB7-14 [36] . This region was totally conserved among all BCV isolates tested. The twenty-six cysteine residues identified above were perfectly conserved among all of the Qu6bec isolates. The five remaining differences in the 160 residues upstream the proteolytic cleavage site represented variability which seemed to be unique to some isolates. The residue changes consisted of Phe for Leu and Asp for -f .................... ~ ........................ :  .................... ~.4 ................ O0 \"I ........................... ~-......................... .......................... ~ ................ ~--. -:   i ........................... ~ .............. .. BCV-L9, BCV-LY, and BCV-VACC [37] ; and BCV-QUEB [20] . The length of the horizontal lines connecting one sequence to another is proportional to the estimated genetic distance between the sequences Val for BCQ-571, IIe for Ser for BCQ-20 and BCQ-9, and Thr for Ile for BCQ-9 which resulted in the loss of one of the four potential N-linked glycosylation sites identified in case of the S1B fragments of the other BCV isolates. Residue substitutions lie for Ser for BCQ-20 and BCQ-9, and Thr for Ile for BCQ-9 also resulted in increased hydrophilicity (Fig. 3) and surface probability in this region. The phylogenetic tree in Fig. 4 shows the relationship of the four Qu6bec clinical BCV isolates to the published homologous sequences from BCV-F15 [3] , BCV-MEB [1] , BCV-LY, BCV-L9, BCV-VACC [37] based on their S1B fragment genes. The homologous sequences of BCV-QUEB [20] , a cell cultureadapted enteropathogenic strain isolated in Qu6bec in 1977, was also included in this comparison. Phylogenetic analyses by Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (GeneWorks) classify recent Qu6bec clinical isolates in a distinct sublineage.\n\nThe third region that was examined contains the coding sequence for the proteolytic cleavage site. The prototype BCV cleavage site sequence consists Comparative sequence analysis of BCV isolates 327 of six residues KRRSRR beginning with aa 763, and predicts a cleavage between aa 768 and 769. Cleavage at the Arg-Ala bond by a host cell trypsin-like enzyme generates the S1 and $2 subunits of the S protein [1] . The sequence of the predicted proteolytic cleavage site (KRRSRR) was conserved among all the isolates studied. However, three of the Qu6bec clinical BCV isolates examined had modifications in aa proximal to the cleavage site. The isolates BCQ-2070, BCQ-20 and BCQ-9 had a Ala-769 to Ser change immediately upstream the cleavage site.\n\nConsidering the complexity of the pathogenicity and tropism of BCV and other coronaviruses, such as turkey coronavirus or human coronavirus HCV-OC43, comparative analysis of different clinical isolates will probably not produce meaningful results. However, with accumulating data on genomic and antigenic characterizations, immunodominant and functional regions can be selected for sequence analysis. In the present study, we chose four Qu6bec BCV isolates recovered from cases of epidemic diarrhea in neonatal calves in Qu6bec dairy herds between 1987-1990 to analyze their sequences in a selected genomic area which codes for immunologically and functionally important domains. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the four clinical isolates indicated that their SiB gene fragments were highly conserved. When compared with the prototype BCV-MEB strain, the S1B gene fragments of these Qu6bec isolates differed by only 2.5 to 3.5~/,~, the highest concentration of nt divergence being located in the polymorphic region. This region has greater than 94~o nt identity with that of the prototype Mebus strain, and apparently, the differing nt were not distributed randomly over the sequences. The mutations have different effects on the encoded aa sequences. Over the S1B sequence most of mutations were silent, in contrast, in the polymorphic region most of the nt substitutions resulted in changes of aa residues. The S1B deduced aa sequences were more than 97~ conserved among the strains, however, the polymorphic region was only 91~ conserved. Recently, comparisons of the S gene sequences of six highly virulent (including BCV-F15) or avirulent (including BCV-MEB, and BCV-QUEB) strains have revealed more than 98~o sequence identity in paired comparison, and most of the substitutions occurred in the S1 subunit and were distributed randomly over the entire sequence [37] . The polymorphic regions were almost completely conserved among all strains, except for the virulent BCV-F15 strain E37]. In the present study, a closer genomic relatedness was demonstrated between BCV-F15 strain and the four Qu6bec clinical BCV isolates. At least twelve aa substitutions have been identified between the virulent and avirulent (BCV-MEB and BCV-QUEB) groups in the highly polymorphic region of the S1 peptide (Fig. 2) , suggesting that aa changes in this particular region of the S glycoprotein may be related to BCV virulence. However, the results obtained do not exclude that other.regions of the BCV genome may be also involved in the virulence or tissue tropism.\n\nIt has been previously demonstrated that antigenic domain II, identified within aa residues 517 to 720, is functionally and immunologically important [36] . The epitopes that mapped in this domain are capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies [34, 36] and, therefore, represent targets of immunological pressure. This antigenic domain, together with the polymorphic region, demonstrated a variability among the Qu6bec clinical isolates. Although the number of aa substitutions was relatively small, the fact that most substitutions appeared to cluster in an hypervariable region of the S gene, suggests these differences may be significant. The present data are in agreement with recent findings using various immunological assays that have shown that the four BCV isolates tested, reacted differently with neutralizing MAbs directed against the S1 subunit of the Mebus strain [19] .\n\nThree of the Qu6bec BCV isolates examined could be differentiated from the prototype BCV-MEB strain by the nt sequences proximal to the proteolytic cleavage site. These isolates had a Ala to Ser change at residue 769 immediately upstream the cleavage site. This change maintained the number and pairing of basic residues of the prototype sequence. Changes in amino acids proximal to the cleavage site of the HA molecule of the influenza A virus have been demonstrated to modulate its cleavability [23] . In addition, changes from Phe to Ser immediately following the proteolytic cleavage site of the F protein of Sendai virus conferred the acquisition of susceptibility to plasmin cleavage; this suggests that regions of the F protein contiguous to the cleavage site can also affect its cleavability by interfering with the efficacy of host proteases involved in the maturation of the viral envelopped glycoprotein [14] . However, in the present study, the Ala to Ser change immediately following the cleavage site of the S glycoprotein of three of the Quebec BCV isolates did not appear to modulate cleavability, and no correlation was found between this substitution and the rate of viral replication and type of cytopathic changes induced in HRT18 cells (data not shown).\n\nThe genomic variations which have been identified in the present study seemed to represent characteristic features of the Qu6bec BCV isolates. Considering the fact that these isolates were not passaged more than five times in HRT-18, and because of the finding of limited identity between Qu6bec BCV isolates, the possibility that our sequence data contain only aa substitutions arising after cell culture passages may be excluded. However, such aa substitutions may have occurred in cases of BCV-MEB and BCV-QUEB isolates for which numerous passages were done in cell lines other than HRT-18 and from heterologous animal species [7, 27] . The human rectal adenocarcinoma cell line has been reported to be susceptible and permissive to human, canine and turkey enteric coronaviruses [6, 8, 16, 17] . This human cell line grows in culture in tightly packed colonies of cells that have retain some characteristics of mature enterocytes [32] . The adaptation of field strains of enteric coronaviruses to this celt line usually requires only few passages. For RNA viruses, it is expected that numerous cell culture passages can result in genomic variations which may occur as point mutations randomly distributed throughout the entire virus genome, rather than clustered in a specific genomic region. In the present study, the sequence heterogeneity was located mostly in the polymorphic region of the S1 glycoprotein.\n\nIn summary, our data have shown that Qu6bec clinical BCV isolates are genetically divergent from the reference strains [1, 3, 20, 37] , and that the polymorphic region demonstrates a high variability. The antigenic as well as genetic relationships among the currently circulating strains of BCV provide useful information for determining the most appropriate composition for the coronaviruses vaccines. Continued surveillance of these viruses will be necessary to detect the emergence of new lineages of BCV with altered antigenic properties and assure that the future vaccines contain the most appropriate strains of BCV."}
