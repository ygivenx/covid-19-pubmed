{"title": "Inhibition of Helicobacter pylori sialic acid-speci\u00a2c haemagglutination by human gastrointestinal mucins and milk glycoproteins", "body": "Inhibition of Helicobacter pylori sialic acid-speci\u00a2c haemagglutination by human gastrointestinal mucins and milk glycoproteins\n\nHelicobacter pylori is a human gastric pathogen which colonises the mucus layer and gastric epithelium and has been associated with type B gastritis and peptic ulcer disease [1] . The attachment of H. pylori to the human gastric mucosa is a complex process involving several speci\u00a2c structures recognised by the cell surface receptors [2, 3] . H. pylori sialic acid-binding haemagglutinin(s) represent a group of such putative cell surface adhesins, proposed to be crucial for the bacterial colonisation of the stomach [4] .\n\nGastrointestinal mucins, high molecular mass glycoproteins which are synthesised and secreted by mucus cells of the human stomach and intestine, show regional variations in composition and expres-sion. The terminal region of O-glycosidically linked carbohydrate chains consist of sialic acid, fucose and N-acetylgalactosamine in addition to galactose and N-acetylglucosamine [5] . An increase in sialylation has been demonstrated for mucosal cells infected with H. pylori [6] . A possible association between the occurrence of O-acetylated sialic acids in intestinal metaplasia and H. pylori infection has also been reported [7] . Controversial results on the role of sialic acids and sulfate for H. pylori binding to gastric mucins have been reported. For example, in one study the in\u00a3uence of sulfation of gastric mucins for H. pylori binding to gastric mucosa has been shown excluding the role of sialic acids in haemagglutination inhibition assays [8] . In contrast, H. pylori binding to human gastric mucin in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was demonstrated to be at least partly sialic acid-dependent [9] . Also for human salivary mucins the importance of both sialylated [10] and sulfated [10] components as receptor structures for H. pylori adhesion has been reported. In addition, the expression of di\u00a1erent binding characteristics depending on growth conditions of the bacteria has been demonstrated. For example, two di\u00a1erent sialic acid-binding adhesins were described for agarand broth-cultured bacteria with the speci\u00a2cities for sialylated glycoproteins and sialylated glycosylceramides [11] .\n\nRecently, we have demonstrated that H. pylori strains can be classi\u00a2ed into sialic acid-independent and -dependent strains speci\u00a2c for terminal K-2,3linked sialic acids [12] . In this study we were interested to compare these strains with respect to their binding to gastric mucins to evaluate the role of sialomucins and sialic acid-speci\u00a2c adhesin(s) of H. pylori in human stomach infection by these bacteria.\n\nHuman red blood cells (RBC) were obtained by venipuncture from a healthy donor. Sialidase (Vibrio cholerae) was purchased from Behringwerke AG (Germany). Fat globule membranes (MFGM-1) were prepared from bovine buttermilk obtained from a butter-making plant of Snow Brand Milk Products Co. Ltd. To remove casein by coagulation, rennet treatment was done at pH 6.2. HR-rennet (0.003% w/v) (Christian Hansen, The Netherlands) was added under mild agitation and then incubated at 30\u00b3C for 27 min until most of the casein was coagulated to form curd. After cutting the curd the mixture was heated slowly for 40 min to a \u00a2nal temperature of 40\u00b3C and kept at this temperature for a further 60 min. Subsequently, the curd was separated from whey containing MFGM using a \u00a2lter cloth. Prepared whey solution was recirculated through a micro\u00a2lter membrane (Carbosep M-14; 0.14 Wm pore size, Techsep, France) to remove proteins and carbohydrates from the whey and to concentrate MFGM in the retentate. Dia\u00a2ltration was performed by concentrating the whey to 30% of its original volume then washing with water 4 times the volume of the retentate under the following operating conditions: \u00a3ow rate, 600 l min 3I ; trans-membrane pressure, 2 kg cm 3P ; temperature, 50\u00b3C, and lyophilised and used as MFGM-1. This material was delipidated to give MFGM-2 by extraction with chloroform:methanol (1:1) followed by chloroform: methanol (2:1). Glyco-macropeptide (GMP) from bovine milk was prepared from bovine milk as described [13] . Sialyl(K-2,3)-lactose was prepared from bovine colostrum as described [14] .\n\nHuman gastric juices, collected from individuals with blood type A, B, AB and O, were fractionated on lysine-Sepharose at pH 2.0. The adsorbed sulfaterich glycoprotein fraction was eluted with 50 mM Tris-HCl bu\u00a1er, pH 7.2, containing 1 M NaCl [15] .\n\nHuman colonic mucins from di\u00a1erent regions (cecum, ascending colon, sigmoid colon and rectum) were prepared as described previously [16] . Mucin preparations were analysed for sialic acid content using the orcinol/Fe Q /HCl method and for the diversity of sialic acids by \u00a3uorometric HPLC after mild acid hydrolysis [17, 18] . For this 5 Wl of each sample was lyophilised and hydrolysed in 100 Wl of 2 M propionic acid at 80\u00b3C for 4 h [19] . After a 100 000Ug centrifugation step in a Beckman TLA 45 rotor for 10 min, the supernatant was lyophilised and the residue hydrolysed with 100 Wl 0.1 M HCl at 80\u00b3C for 50 min and lyophilised. Both hydrolysates were combined in a minimum of water and lyophilised again. The samples were dissolved in 10 Wl of 2 M acetic acid. After the addition of 49 Wl 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene reagent, the mixture was heated for 1 h at 56\u00b3C in the dark. Separation was carried out on a RP18-column (Merck, LiChrospher 100, 250U5 mm i.d., particle size 5 Wm) using methanol/acetonitrile/water (7:9:84, v/v) in isocratic mode (1 ml min 3I ) for elution and detecting the corresponding quinoxalinones at an excitation wavelength of 373 nm and an emission wavelength of 448 nm. The peaks were identi\u00a2ed by their retention times relative to the authentic standards Neu5Ac, 9-O-acetylated Neu5Ac (Neu5,9Ac P ) and 7-O-acetylated Neu5Ac (Neu5,7Ac P ).\n\nDesialylation was performed with V. cholerae sialidase incubating the samples (0.3 mg) with 5 mU sialidase in 100 Wl 50 mM sodium acetate bu\u00a1er (pH 5.5) containing 2 mM CaCl P at 37\u00b3C for 1 h. The enzyme was then inactivated at 96\u00b3C for 5 min. Control samples were treated in the same way without the addition of enzyme.\n\nFor acid hydrolysis of all sialic acids, the gastric mucins were incubated in 0.1 M HCl at 80\u00b3C for 1 h. After cooling on ice and neutralising with 1 N NaOH, the samples were dialysed against distilled water [18] . Beside acidic conditions, incubation in PBS (pH 7.2) was performed as a control.\n\nFor the de-O-acetylation of sialic acids, human colonic mucins were treated with 0.1 M NaOH for 1 h on ice followed by neutralising with an equal volume of 0.1 M HCl [18] .\n\nH. pylori strains 52 and 349/94 from the University of Lund collection were studied [12] . Strains were stored at 380\u00b3C in tryptic soy broth containing 15% (v/v) glycerol and were cultured under microaerophilic conditions at 37\u00b3C for 3 days on GAB-Camp agar with de\u00a2brinated horse blood (5% v/v) [20] .\n\nBacteria were collected from the agar plates, washed once with 0.01 M phosphate bu\u00a1er, pH 7.2, containing 0.15 M NaCl (PBS) and suspended in the same bu\u00a1er to a \u00a2nal concentration of 10 W cells ml 3I . For the extraction of cell surface proteins including the sialic acid-binding activity, H. pylori cells harvested from agar plates (approx. 0.5 g wet weight) were washed once with PBS, treated with 2 ml deionised water containing 5 mM HEPES bu\u00a1er (pH 7.2) for 30 min at room temperature and sedimented by centrifugation (10 000Ug at 4\u00b3C, 10 min). Prior to use, 1/10 vol. of 10UPBS was added to the supernatant.\n\nEqual volumes of two-fold dilutions of H. pylori cell suspensions or cell surface protein extracts and 0.75% suspensions of human RBC (20 Wl) were mixed in wells of microtitre plates (U-shaped) and allowed to settle at room temperature for 1^2 h. Haemagglutination was visualised by the aggregated cells settling on the bottom of the well forming a loose carpet [12] .\n\nBacterial samples, bacterial suspensions or surface protein extracts were diluted with PBS to give 4 HAU (haemagglutinating units). One HAU was de\u00a2ned as the amount of bacteria which causes complete agglutination under the conditions described above.\n\nInhibition tests were performed by mixing 15 Wl of bacterial samples with 15 Wl of a serial dilution of inhibitor for 1 h at room temperature, after which 15 Wl of a 0.75% RBC suspension was added to each well and allowed to settle at room temperature for 1^2 h.\n\nTwo H. pylori strains (52 and 349/94) were chosen for our studies on the basis of their sialic acid-spe-ci\u00a2c haemagglutination. The haemagglutination of H. pylori strain 52 is sialic acid-dependent by recognising oligosaccharide chains with terminal K-2,3linked sialic acid on RBC as demonstrated previously [12] , whereas the H. pylori strain 349/94 agglutinates RBC independently of the presence of cell surface sialic acids.\n\nThe highly sulfated mucin preparations (approx. 55 Wmol sulfate/100 mg mucin) from gastric juice eluted from lysine-Sepharose, contained 5^10 Wmol sialic acid/100 mg mucin, depending on the origin of the sample. The sialic acid contents of unadsorbed and much less sulfated (approx. 6 Wmol sulfate/100 mg mucin) mucin fractions were in the range of 45 .5 Wmol/100 mg mucin. Both these mucin fractions showed high inhibitory potency for H. pylori strain 52 (Table 1) . No remarkable di\u00a1erence in the concentration causing 50% inhibition was observed when comparing the mucins from individuals with di\u00a1erent blood types. After V. cholerae sialidase treatment, the inhibitory activity of the mucins was signi\u00a2cantly decreased, since 3^10-fold higher concentrations were required for the same degree of inhibition (Table 1) . Similar results were obtained when terminal sialic acids were hydrolysed with HCl. The haemagglutination inhibition activities of the control mucin samples, treated in a similar way but without sialidase or at neutral pH, were not impaired. The results obtained with extracted cell surface proteins of H. pylori sialic acid-dependent strain 52 were comparable with those for whole cells.\n\nThe mucin preparations showed inhibitory potency also for H. pylori strain 349/94, which was not abolished by the removal of sialic acids from mucins. Mucin concentrations necessary to cause 50% haemagglutination inhibition of this strain were comparable with those obtained for H. pylori strain 52 with sialidase-treated mucins. In the case of sialidase-treated samples the sialic acid was present in free form. Our studies have shown that free sialic acid is not inhibitory up to 65 mM. O-Acetylated sialic acids are the sum of Neu5,7Ac P and Neu5,9Ac P .\n\nIn human colonic mucins, there are various Oacetylated sialic acids beside Neu5Ac [21] . The total sialic acid content was in the range of 20^90 Wmol sialic acid/100 mg mucin depending on the sample with 15^35% being Neu5,7Ac P and Neu5,9Ac P . Also the colonic mucins were potent inhibitors for H. pylori strain 52 haemagglutination ( Table 2 ). The alkaline treatment of the mucins for de-O-acetylation did not in\u00a3uence their inhibitory potencies for H. pylori-induced haemagglutination. In addition, no signi\u00a2cant correlation between the ratio of O-acetylated sialic acids to total sialic acid content in mucin samples and their inhibitory potencies was found. However, it should be kept in mind that the level of O-acetylation in these mucins was not high enough to draw \u00a2nal conclusions on this aspect.\n\nBovine MFGM were tested before and after delipidation. Both preparations inhibited haemagglutination of H. pylori strain 52 (Table 3) already at low concentrations. The \u00a2nding that the delipidated material inhibited at least as well as the native fraction suggests that the mucin-like portion is most important for the inhibitory potency. GMP, a sialoglycoprotein from milk with de\u00a2ned sugar chains containing terminal Neu5Ac(K-2,3)-Gal residues, was an about 20-fold less potent inhibitor than MFGM, requiring sialic acid concentrations almost as high as sialyl(K-2,3)-lactose for 50% inhibition (Table 3) .\n\nThe aim of this study was to demonstrate the possible role of sialic acid residues in mucin and mucinlike preparations to be recognised by H. pylori sialic acid-speci\u00a2c haemagglutinin(s). Our results show high inhibitory potencies of these molecules for H. pylori sialic acid-speci\u00a2c haemagglutination. By far the best inhibitors were the gastric mucins (compare data in Tables 1^3). The inhibitory activities of gastric mucins were a\u00a1ected by sialidase treatment indicating the importance of sialic acids of these mucins for the recognition by H. pylori sialic aciddependent strains. The residual inhibitory activities of the mucins after the removal of sialic acids could be explained by sulfate present in mucin preparations as binding sites for a corresponding adhesin of H. pylori. But obviously the presence of sialic acid residues on the gastric mucins strongly enhances the interaction with H. pylori strains expressing sialic acid-dependent adhesins.\n\nO-Acetylation of sialic acids has been shown to be the essential receptor determinant for some viruses such as in\u00a3uenza C and corona viruses [22, 23] , whereas this sialic acid modi\u00a2cation prevents the adhesion of other viruses such as in\u00a3uenza A or B [24] . Using human colonic mucins, which beside Neu5Ac contain also O-acetylated sialic acids, we did not obtain signi\u00a2cant evidence for an in\u00a3uence of O-acetylation on H. pylori binding. This implies that this modi\u00a2cation of sialic acids is not required for binding. However, it cannot be completely ruled out that O-acetylation can mask the binding sites for H. pylori, since only a part of the sialic acids in colonic mucins were substituted.\n\nRoles of mucin-like components from milk in the prevention of bacterial adhesion have been reported for several pathogens [25, 26] . In our studies, MFGM preparation showed a high inhibitory potency for H. pylori-induced haemagglutination. Furthermore, the lipid part of the preparation does not seem to be involved in the binding of bacteria, since delipidation did not change the inhibitory potency of the preparation. The results obtained with low molecular mass components from milk such as GMP with terminal K-2,3-linked Neu5Ac as well as with sialyl(K-2,3)-lactose showing an inhibitory e\u00a1ect against H. pylori at higher sialic acid concentrations compared to (Table 3) , and with free Neu5-Ac not a\u00a1ecting the haemagglutination, demonstrate the relevance of a mucin-like presentation of the glycans for a pronounced inhibitory e\u00a1ect. In our studies we demonstrate the importance of H. pylori sialic acid-binding haemagglutinin(s) for the interaction with gastric mucins, facilitating the spreading of the bacteria in the host by leading them to speci\u00a2c epithelial cell targets to attach and to cause tissue damage. This does not exclude other possible role(s) of sialic acid-speci\u00a2c binding of H. pylori in the colonisation process in the stomach. Furthermore, H. pylori binding to the extracellular matrix component laminin was recently shown to be sialic acid-dependent [27] . Also the importance of sialylated oligosaccharides on human gastric epithelial cells as binding sites for H. pylori has been described [28] . Since mucin-like high molecular mass components from milk showed high inhibitory potencies for H. pylori adhesion comparable to gastrointestinal mucin preparations, these could serve as potent anti-infectious components against H. pylori."}
