{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Immunofluorescence and molecular diagnosis of bovine respiratory syncytial virus and bovine parainfluenza virus in the naturally infected young cattle and buffaloes from India", "body": "Livestock production plays a key role in India's agricultural economy as it offers bovine rhinovirus, bovine reovirus and Influenza A viruses have also been reported occasionally 89 to be associated with pneumonia in calves (Sreenivasan et al., 2019; Hodgins et al., 2002) . suppression of the local immune defense mechanism, which may facilitate rapid bacterial 97 multiplication leading to acute to chronic pneumonia in a synergistic manner (Caswell, 2014) . Processing of tissues for histopathology 140 After proper fixation in 10% NBF, tissues were cut into small sections with a thickness of Belgium, UK and the USA in NCBI database. Further, the isolates were distantly related to the 230 sequences of the isolates reported from Denmark, France and the Czech Republic (Fig. 3) .\n\nSequence distance of the BRSV isolates with respect to those reported in the NCBI database is 232 presented in Fig. 3 . \n\nAlthough amplicons size was very small and the small number of samples evaluated in the study, 309 the obtained data suggest that BRSV is circulating in India among the bovine population.
