{"title": "Constitutive IFNa/b signaling maintains expression of signaling intermediaries for efficient cytokine responses", "body": "The exposure of cells to cytokines, chemokines and other extracellular signals during pathogenic infection, injury and neoplasia allows for potent, and often synergistic, host immune responses. 1, 2 IFNs, a family of immunoregulatory cytokines with important roles in anti-pathogen and antitumor responses, can synergise with other stimuli, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) a and interleukin (IL) 1a for more potent immune responses. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Upon IFN binding, receptor-associated janus activated kinases (JAKs) are phosphorylated leading to activation of latent signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) molecules. Pivotal to IFN signaling is the transcription factor STAT1, the loss of which severely impairs IFN-dependent cellular responses. 11, 12 The canonical, JAK/STAT1-dependent IFNg signaling pathway has been extensively studied, however more recently alternate signaling pathways triggered by IFNg such as mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kB (NFkB) pathways have been identified. [13] [14] [15] [16] Although specific IFN family members bind to selective receptors and activate distinct signaling pathways, significant crosstalk between these pathways is evident. [1] [2] [3] 6, 17, 18 Pre-treatment of cells with low levels of type I IFNs (IFNa/b) leads to more potent response to type II IFN (IFNg) and interestingly loss of the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) results in diminished type II IFN responses. 19, 20 Although type I IFNs are secreted in abundance in response to viral infection, uninfected cells also constitutively secrete low concentrations of IFNa/b. [21] [22] [23] [24] Studies by our laboratory and others, show that cells unable to produce or respond to constitutive IFNa/b have attenuated STAT1 expression. This led to a model of cytokine crosstalk which postulates that priming levels of IFNb regulate STAT1 expression, which is important for mediating IFNg responses. 23, 25, 26 Moreover, we have demonstrated that reconstitution of STAT1 into Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 cells could restore IFNginduced STAT1 DNA binding and partially rescued IFNg-dependent anti-viral responses. 23 In this study we used global gene expression analysis to examine the contribution of STAT1 to the crosstalk between tonic IFNa/b and IFNg. Our data revealed that STAT1 alone regulates only a small proportion of IFN crosstalk. Moreover, loss of tonic IFNa/b signaling results in aberrant expression of numerous transcription factors and intracellular signaling molecules, thus tonic IFNa/b signaling regulates the expression of multiple signaling intermediaries involved in cytokine signaling.\n\nSTAT1 is the canonical transcription factor activated in response to IFNg and we have previously found that its expression is attenuated in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 cells. 23 To determine the extent to which STAT1 reconstitution alone could rescue molecular responses to IFNg in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 cells, microarray-based gene expression analysis was performed over a 6 hr time course. Prior to microarray analysis STAT1 expression in wild type, Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 , empty vector-transduced (Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 MSCV) and HA-tagged STAT1atransduced (Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 HA-STAT1) Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) was confirmed by western blotting (Fig. 1A) . Probes in which IFNg induced a significant (p < 0.05) and greater than 1.2-fold increase or decrease in expression were considered to be regulated by IFNg. Of the 362 probes which had induced expression in wild type cells following 1 hr of IFNg treatment, 109 probes (30.1%) were also induced in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 and/or Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 MSCV cells and Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 HA-STAT1 cells (Fig. 1B) .\n\nIn contrast to induced gene expression, only 5 of the 440 probes which showed significant repression in response 1 hr of IFNg treatment in wild type cells, were also repressed in wild type, Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 and/or Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 MSCV cells and Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 HA-STAT1 cells (Fig. 1B) . Similar patterns of gene expression were seen at the later time points with 18.2% and 40.3% of probes induced and 3.2% and 2.5% of probes repressed in wild type, Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 and/or Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 MSCV cells and Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 HA-STAT1 cells in response to 3 and 6 hrs of IFNg treatment respectively (Fig. 1C-D) .\n\nTo determine the genes for which loss of IFNAR1 expression attenuated IFNg responsiveness, we compared the wild type and Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 microarray data sets and considered probes which lacked a significant, >1.2-fold change in expression or had >1.2-fold attenuation of gene regulation compared to wild type cells as having lost IFNg responsiveness. In response to 1, 3 and 6 hrs of IFNg treatment, 85.6%, 93.6% and 75.3% of probes had attenuated gene induction in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 cells compared to wild type cells respectively ( Fig. 1B-D) . For IFNg-dependent gene repression 99.3%, 99.8% and 98.1% of probes had attenuated responses following 1, 3 and 6 hrs of IFNg treatment ( Fig. 1B-D) . These data indicate that the vast majority of IFNg regulated genes are affected by the absence of IFNAR1.\n\nSTAT1a reconstitution of Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 cells was considered to have rescued IFNg responses if the following criteria were met: (i) The gene had lost IFNg responsiveness in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 and Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 MSCV cells compared to wild type cells (ii) The gene had wild type-equivalent responsiveness to IFNg in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 HA-STAT1 cells (i.e. a significant and >1.2-fold change in expression relative to untreated and <1.2-fold attenuation of gene regulation in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 HA-STAT1 cells compared to wild type cells). Of the 310 probes in which IFNginduced gene expression was attenuated in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 cells following 1 hr of IFNg treatment, 43 (13.8%) probes had rescued IFNg responsiveness in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 HA-STAT1 cells (Fig. 1E ). In response to 3 hrs and 6 hrs of IFNg treatment, induction of gene expression of 62 (8.4%) and 38 (7.4%) probes with attenuated responses in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 cells was rescued in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 HA-STAT1 cells respectively ( Fig. 1F-G) . In contrast to the effects on IFNgdependent gene induction, Stat1a reconstitution of Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 cells only rescued gene repression of 0.7%, 1.0% and 0.4% of probes following 1, 3 and 6 hrs of IFNg treatment respectively. These data indicated that the effect of STAT1 reconstitution on IFNg-dependent gene regulation was greatest during early phase gene induction. \n\nOntological analysis of the microarray data was performed to identify the biological pathways rescued following IFNg treatment of Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 HA-STAT1 cells. The 2106 genes with attenuated regulation by IFNg in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 MEFs over the 6 hr time course of IFNg treatment were analyzed using Meta-CorZe's Genego. Genes with aberrant expression following IFNg treatment in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 MEFs were involved in a diverse range of biological pathways, with the most significantly affected including developmental, immunological response, reproduction and apoptosis pathways (Fig 2A) . Surprisingly, only one pathway directly associated with STAT signaling was found among the 10 most significantly affected biological pathways. Subsequently, genes with attenuated regulation by IFNg in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 MEFs were compared to the genes in which IFNg responses were significantly rescued by reconstitution of STAT1 using MetaCore's Genego comparative analysis for pathway maps. This analysis revealed, unsurprisingly, that among the 10 pathways most significantly affected by both the loss of IFNAR1 and reconstitution of STAT1 cells were the IFNa/b signaling pathway and multiple JAK/ STAT signaling pathways ( Fig. 2A ). Of the 10 most significantly affected pathways, 7 were associated with immune responses with the most significantly affected pathway being the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway ( Fig. 2A-B) . These data suggested that despite genes involved in a diverse array of biological responses pathways being aberrantly regulated by IFNg in the absence of IFNAR1, the pathways in which STAT1 reconstitution of IFNAR1 deficient cells rescued IFNg-mediated gene regulation were enriched for immune response pathways.\n\nSeveral components of the MHC class Idependent antigen presentation pathway were significantly rescued by STAT1 reconstitution of Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 cells as determined by microarray analysis (Fig. 2C) . We had previously found that STAT1 reconstitution of Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 cells rescued IFNg-dependent induction of RNA expression for a key molecule in antigen presentation, b 2 microgloblin (B2M). 23 Therefore the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway represented an ideal candidate to validate the attenuation of IFNg-dependent biological responses in IFNAR1 deficient cells and its rescue by STAT1 reconstitution.\n\nWe first examined the IFNg-dependent induction of molecules involved in the transport of peptides to the endoplasmic reticulum, transporter associated with antigen processing (Tap)1 and Tap2, in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 cells. In corroboration with the microarray data, we found reduced IFNg-mediated protein induction of TAP1 expression in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 MEFs compared to wild type MEFs following exposure to IFNg for 6 hrs (Fig. 3A) . There was also attenuation of TAP2 induction in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 MEFs in response to 6 hrs of IFNg treatment and a minor effect of loss of IFNAR1 for cells treated for 24 hrs (Fig. 3B ). Reconstitution of STAT1 in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 HA-STAT1 cells rescued IFNg-mediated induction of TAP1 in response to 6 hrs and TAP2 following 6 and 24 hrs of treatment (( Fig. 3A-B) . Similar to the TAP molecules, induction of proteasome subunit, b type (PSMB)9, a catalytic component of the immunoproteasome, was attenuated in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 cells following 6 hrs of treatment ( Fig 3A) . This attenuated induction of PSMB9 was also evident in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 MSCV cells following 6 hrs of IFNg treatment and importantly, was rescued to wild type equivalent levels in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 HA-STAT1 cells (Fig. 3C) . Notably, PSMB9 expression reached wild type equivalent levels in all IFNAR1 deficient cell lines by 24 hrs of IFNg treatment suggesting that, as seen in for multiple genes in the microarray analysis, IFNAR1 expression was required for early, but not late phases responses.\n\nFinally, we assessed the effects of STAT1 on the ability of IFNg to regulate cell surface expression of the MHC class I heavy chain on Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 cells. Again, in agreement with the microarray analysis, Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 and Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 MSCV MEFs displayed significantly attenuated IFNg responses, with minimal changes in H2-K b and H2D b expression compared to wild type cells (Fig. 3D-E) . In contrast, cell surface expression of H2-K b and H2-D b following both 5 and 10 U/ml treatments of IFNg was, like wild type cells, significantly induced on Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 HA-STAT1 cells (Fig. 3D-E) . Together, these data indicated that STAT1-reconstitution was able to rescue the attenuated IFNg-dependent regulation of mRNA and protein expression of genes involved in protein processing, peptide transport and cell surface antigen presentation in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 cells. Data represents the IFNg-induced change in MFI relative to untreated for 11-13 independent experiments and error bars are SEM. Significant changes in MFI relative to untreated (fold increase in MFI) were determined by t-test # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, ### p < 0.001. Significant differences in fold increase in MFI relative to wild type were determined by t-test *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.\n\nConstitutive IFNa/b signaling regulates the expression of multiple signaling molecules\n\nHaving found that STAT1 reconstitution of IFNAR1-deficient cells only rescued a proportion (\u00bb15%) of IFNg regulated genes and that these genes were enriched for involvement in immune and inflammatory responses, we investigated whether constitutive IFNa/b signaling regulated the expression of other transcription factors to modulate IFN crosstalk. We first examined expression of other members of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway known to be regulated by and involved in IFN signaling. In corroboration with our previous qRT-PCR findings, there was attenuated RNA expression of Stat1 and Stat2, but not Socs3, in unstimulated Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 cells, as determined by microarray and qRT-PCR analysis (Stat1 and Socs3) (Supp. Fig. 1A , Supp. Table 1 -2). 23 Similarly, we validated our previously identified decrease in basal STAT3 protein expression using primary C57BL/6 Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 MEFs and confirmed that the attenuated STAT3 protein expression evident in 129/C3H MEFs lacking IFNAR1 was related to a significant decrease in RNA expression (Supp. Fig. 1A-B ). 23 Given that both IFNg and IL-6 can activate STAT3 and that, IL-6 mediated STAT3 DNA binding is attenuated in the absence of IFNAR1, 27 we assessed STAT3 activation following IFNg or IL-6 treatment of Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 cells. In contrast to previous findings, 27 we found reduced STAT3 phosphorylation following IL-6 stimulation of Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 cells (Fig. 4A) . Similarly, IFNgmediated STAT3 activation was also attenuated in IFNAR1-deficient cells (Fig. 4A) . These data indicate that constitutive IFNa/b signaling regulates expression of multiple STAT transcription factors and that this may influence crosstalk with cytokines other than IFNs.\n\nTo determine the effect that loss of constitutive IFNa/b signaling has on the global transcriptional profile of resting cells, we assessed transcription factor expression in unstimulated wild type and Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 MEFs by microarray analysis. 1264 genes had 1.2-fold (p0.05) differential basal expression in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 MEFs compared to wild type MEFs (Supp. Table. 1).\n\nOf the 1264 genes with differences in basal expression between wild type and Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 cells, 106 were known transcription factors (Supp . Table. 2). Furthermore, qRT-PCR analysis of intracellular signaling molecules known to crosstalk with the type I IFN signaling pathway confirmed the reduced expression of genes involved in TLR and NF-kB signaling, Myd88, Nfkbia and Nfkbie (Fig. 4B) in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 cells (Fig. 4 .b and Supp. Table. 2).\n\nWe also assessed RNA and protein expression of several transcription factors known to regulate IFNg responses that were not identified by the microarray analysis as having attenuated expression in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 MEFs. We found significantly reduced RNA expression of the transcription factors c-Jun and Irf1 by qRT-PCR analysis (Fig. 4B ). As shown in Figure . 4C, Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 MEFs also expressed less c-Jun protein than wild type MEFs and thus the decrease in c-Jun mRNA expression observed correlated with a similar decrease in total protein expression. Similarly, although we found no reduction in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 expression by microarray analysis, basal expression of ERK1, but not ERK2 was reduced in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 MEFs (Fig. 4D) . Overall, these data revealed that the absence of IFNAR1 results in reduced aberrant expression of multiple transcription factors which are involved in a range of cytokine and inflammatory signaling responses.\n\nThe canonical signal transduction pathways activated by cytokines to modulate cellular responses and gene expression have been extensively investigated. These pathways are comprised of signaling intermediaries such as kinases, G proteins, adaptor proteins and transcription factors that get turned 'on' and 'off' in the presence of a stimulus. In contrast, the physiological scenario of concomitant exposure to several cytokines and the consequences and mechanisms regulating these interactions are relatively undefined. 28 Cytokine crosstalk can occur at the level of the receptor, by regulation of the expression of receptor components or the e1173804- 8 Messina et al.\n\nformation of receptor complexes. 19, 27, [29] [30] [31] Crosstalk can also occur at the level of gene promoters as a result of multiple promoter binding sites or chromatin priming. 32, 33 In this study, we examined the impact that the regulation of the basal levels of intracellular signaling molecules has on cytokine responses. We had previous established that STAT1 reconstitution of Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 cells rescued IFNgdependent STAT1 activation and DNA binding and partially rescued IFNg-mediated protection from the cytopathic effects of ECMV. 23 Using microarray analysis to ascertain the effects of STAT1 reconstitution of IFNAR1-defient cells on a genome wide scale we found that although STAT1 is the canonical transcription factor activated by IFNg, only up to 15.4% and 3.2% of IFNg-dependent gene induction and repression were rescued by STAT1 respectively. Moreover, the ability of STAT1 to rescue IFNg responses diminished over time. The relatively minor effect of STAT1 expression of IFNg mediated gene repression was unsurprising however, as gene repression by IFNg is purported to be mediated via STAT1 independent pathways 34 such as CIITA mediated histone deacetylation. [35] [36] [37] Also, as STAT1 is induced by IFNg signaling, [38] [39] [40] it is plausible that at later time points de novo STAT1 production in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 cells in response to IFNg treatment was able to rescue the IFNg responsiveness of genes at later time points. Treatment of primary human fibroblasts with both IFNb and IFNg synergistically induces expression of genes involved in apoptosis and inflammatory responses. 41 Similarly, the biological response pathways which showed attenuated IFNg responses in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 cells and for which STAT1 reconstitution significantly rescued IFNg responsiveness were both enriched for immune responses, apoptosis and alternate cytokine signaling pathways. As expected, our microarray and protein analysis indicated that IFNg-dependent regulation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway was significantly affected by the loss of tonic IFNa/b however, interestingly, the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway was the most sensitive to loss of IFNAR1 and was also significantly rescued by STAT1 reconstitution. Expression of a number of genes involved in MHC class I antigen presentation, including Tap1, Psmb9 and MHC class I heavy chain, are known to be mediated by type I and type II IFNs in a STAT1-dependent manner. 12, [42] [43] [44] [45] It was however surprising, given that this regulation is co-operatively mediated by other factors including IRF1, IRF2 and the ISGF3 complex for which basal expression was also reduced (Fig. 4 and Supp. Table 2), that STAT1 alone was able to rescue the IFNgdependent regulation of these genes.\n\nAlthough reconstitution of STAT1 in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 cells had a major effect on several biological pathways, \u00bb85% of IFNg-mediated gene regulation was not rescued. Mediation of cytokine crosstalk by the regulating the expression of signaling intermediaries has also been suggested for STAT4, 46, 47 IkB, 48 IRF9 49 and IRF2. 50 Our studies, which found that expression of over 100 transcription factors and numerous other signaling intermediaries, including Myd88, IKKg and MAPK kinases, were decreased in cells that lacked tonic IFNa/b, suggests that rather than being regulated by a single transcription factor or signaling complex, cytokine crosstalk likely involves regulation of the expression of a multitude of signaling molecules. This level of regulation may enhance specific biological responses when particular sets of transcription factors are involved. For example, although expression of STAT1 had a profound effect on IFNg dependent regulation of genes involved in antigen presentation, other IFNg-dependent responses, including regulation of genes involved in development and TLR-dependent immune responses, were not rescued by STAT1 reconstitution of Ifnar1 \u00a1/-MEFs. As RNA expression of the signaling intermediary Myd88, a fundamental component of the TLR signaling pathway, 51,52 was, like STAT1, attenuated in cells lacking constitutive IFNb signaling, it is plausible that tonic IFNa/ b augments TLR responsiveness by regulating the expression of Myd88. Moreover, as expression or activation of transcription factors involved in signaling via other cytokines known to engage in crosstalk with IFNa/b such as IL-6, IL-1 and TNFa 6,27,28,53-55 were also revealed by our studies to be attenuated in IFNAR1-deficient cells, it suggest that tonic IFNa/b also regulates responsiveness to these cytokines by this mechanism.\n\nOverall we have demonstrated that, in addition to maintenance of STAT1 expression, constitutive IFNa/b-signaling mediated by IFNAR1 regulates the expression of multiple transcription factors and signaling intermediaries. Moreover, based on the sub-set of biological responses pathways affected by STAT1 expression, we suggest that, the regulation of signaling molecules involved in specific biological pathways or activated by specific cytokines may be a mechanism whereby synergistic biological responses by multiple cytokines are fine-tuned. \n\nGeneration of wild type and Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 129/ C3H MEFs and retroviral transduction of Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 129/C3H MEFs was described previously. 23 \n\nRNA was extracted from wild type, Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 , Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 MSCV and Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 HA-STAT1 transduced 129/C3H MEFs using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA quality was assessed by bioanalyzer using RNA Nano Chip (Agilent technologies) as per the manufacturer's instructions. RNA samples were considered degraded if RNA integrity number (RIN) was below 8.\n\nAll reagents (except 100% and 80%v/v Ethanol) were purchased from Affymetrix (Millennium Science) as part of the One-Cycle Target Labeling and Control Reagents (P/N 900493) package and GeneChip \u00d2 Hybridization control kit (P/N 900454). cDNA preparation, sample hybridization and scanning of the oligonucleotide microarray GeneChip Arrays (Affymetrix) was performed as per manufacturer's instructions. Briefly 1mg RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript II and T-7 Oligo (dT). Second strand cDNA synthesis, mediated by RNase H was followed by an in vitro transcription (IVT) reaction with T7 RNA polymerase, biotin-11-CTP and biotin-16-UTP to generate biotin labeled cRNA. Purified cRNA was fragmented by mild alkaline treatment, then hybridized to the GeneChip \u00d2 Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array Mouse chips (probe arrays) (Affymetrix) and washed using the GeneChip \u00d2 Fluidics Station 450. Array chips were then stained with Streptavidin Phycoethrin (SAPE) (Molecular Probes) Biotinylated antibody (Vector Labs). Cartridges were loaded into autoloader of the GeneChip \u00d2 Scanner 3000 7 G laser scanner.\n\nThe data (.dat) file, was automatically converted to a cell intensity (.cel) file and the quality of the individual arrays was assessed using GCOS. Microarray CEL files (Affymetrix probe identities and intensities) were converted to annotation files using Affy software (Affy). 57 All microarray data was assessed for degradation (degradation plots, Affy) normalized by Robust multi-array (RMA) normalization (Affy), p-values determined by Students ttest using Linear Models for Microarray Analysis (LIMMA) and multiple test corrections for each sample set comparison was performed using Benjamini-Hochberg multiple test correction method. 58 Significance cut offs of p 0.05 and fold change 1.2 for each comparison were implemented.\n\nRNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alternatively, RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN) as per manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized from 1 mg RNA using superscript III (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The abundance of specific genes in the samples was quantitated using the SYBR Green dye detection method (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). Primers to murine genes were as follows.\n\nc-Jun ACTCCGAGCTGGCATCCA CCCA CTGTTAACGTGGTTCATG\n\nThreshold cycle numbers (Ct) were measured in the exponential phase for all samples. Relative abundance of sample genes was calculated using the \"DDCT method\" relative to the L32 control gene. mRNA abundance was normalized to the untreated samples of each genotype or relative to wild type as indicated.\n\nSamples were first incubated in FC block in 2% FBS/PBS for 20 minutes. Antibodies against H2D b (28-14-8) and H2K b (AF6-88.5) were obtained from BD Pharmingen. Viability was determined by absence of Fluoro-gold uptake.\n\nCells were washed once in PBS and lysed in whole cell lysis buffer (0.05% Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid, 0.1 mM ethylene glycol tetra-acetic acid and 10% glycerol), containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1mg/mL aprotinin,0.5 mg/mL leupeptin, 0.2 mM PMSF, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 1 mM b glycero-phosphate) at 4 C for 10 min. Lysates were then cleared by centrifugation. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were probed with specific antibodies against Actin (Sigma), HSP70 (kind gift from R. Anderson), STAT1a/b (C terminus) (BD Bioscience), p-STAT3, STAT3, c-JUN, ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology), PSMB9 (Abcam), TAP1 or TAP2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Secondary antibodies were conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and images were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL, GE Healthcare).\n\nStatistical significance was assessed using Microsoft Excel software. For comparisons of means, Student's t-Test (t-test) was used and pvalues <0.05 were considered significant. For cluster analysis of microarray probes, k-means organized arrays via Euclidean distance were displayed as logbase2. For cluster analysis of antigen presentation genes, hierarchical organized arrays via Euclidean distance were displayed as logbase2. Cluster analysis was performed using Cluster 3.0 59 and visualised using Java Tree View. 60 Pathway enrichment analysis and identification of transcription factors was performed using MetaCore from Thomson Reuters (MetaCore Genego, Thomson Reuters, https://portal.genego.com/Genego). \n\nNo potential conflicts of interest were disclosed."}
