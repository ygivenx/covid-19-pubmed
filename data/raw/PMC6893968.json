{"title": "Evaluation of the\nAntiviral Potential of Halogenated Dihydrorugosaflavonoids and Molecular\nModeling with nsP3 Protein of Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV)", "body": "The cases of chikungunya viral fever are\nburgeoning every year. Infections are not only limited to Asia and\nAfrica; recently, the epidemics of chikungunya have been reported\nfrom Central and South America.1,2 Concerning the data\nobtained from the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme\n(NVBDCP, India), the number of infected people identified in April\n2018 was 9175, 4875 from Karnataka following 1375 from Gujarat and\n966 from Maharashtra. Earlier research studies have shown that there\nis considerable resource burden from chikungunya outbreaks, which\nescalates in monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Therefore, cases of\nchikungunya viral fever have increased in the continent of Asia and\nvarious parts of the world. The name chikungunya originates from \u201cMakonde\u201d,\nmeaning \u201cto become twisted\u201d. It denotes the \u201ccurved\u201d\nappearance of those going through joint ache as a result of chikungunya\ninfection. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) spreads by mosquito vectors Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The common eukaryotic hosts are primates and humans. In humans,\nthe symptoms associated with CHIKV are nausea, fever, joint pain,\nvomiting, rashes, and persistent arthralgia. Clinical manifestation\nis one of the bases for the diagnosis of chikungunya infection, but\nthe confirmation of disease can only be made after laboratory tests.\nSuspected cases are validated by positive anti-Chikungunya virus IgM\nor IgG results or by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results.3,4\n\nIn Togaviridae family, CHIKV comes under the genus Alphavirus.\nAlphaviruses are configured as enveloped positive-sense single-stranded\nRNA viruses. There are 29 members in the alphavirus genus; some members\nof the genus contain several animal and human viruses like Ross River\nvirus, Sindbis virus (SINV), Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV),\nSemiliki Forest virus (SFV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus\n(VEEV), etc. They are furthermore categorized into Old World and New\nWorld viruses reliant on the changes that occurred in their life cycle,\nfatality, and clinical manifestations. Basically, the Old World viruses\nCHIKV, SINV, SFV, etc. engage the protein nsp2 to downregulate the\nhost cell transcription, have less demise percentage, and stimulate\narthralgia. The New World viruses VEEV, WEEV, etc. use virus capsid\nprotein (CP) to downregulate the host cell transcription, have high\ncasualty frequency, and generate encephalitis.\n\nCrystallographic\nstudies and cryoelectron microscopy of different alphaviruses and\ntheir proteins deliver vital information regarding the molecular organization\nand the distribution of the virion structural portions.5\u221212 Encapsidated by 240 copies of CP, the RNA genome of CHIKV makes\nthe nucleocapsid core.13,14 The grown-up alphavirus virion\n(70 nm in diameter) has an envelope, which is derived from the host,\nhaving T = 4 icosahedral symmetry embedded with 80\nspikes. Trimers of E1 and E2 (surface glycoproteins) heterodimers\nbuild up every spike.15 CHIKV bears a genome\nof almost \u223c11.7 kb, polyadenylated at the 3\u2032 end and\ncapped at the 5\u2032 end. The non-structural polyproteins (nsP1234)\nare encoded by the 5\u2032 two-third open reading frame (ORF) of\nthe genome. The three chief structural proteins (capsid (C), E1, and\nE2) are encoded by the 3\u2032 one-third ORF of the genome.16 The functioning of non-structural protein (nsP)\npromotes the construction of distinct mature non-structural proteins\n(nsp1\u20134). nsP1 is the capping enzyme, nsP2 is the viral helicase\nand protease, and nsP4 is RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which has\nan intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain.17 The role of nsP3 was not very well defined. However, recently,\nMcPherson et al.18 have reported that CHIKV\u2019s\nnsP3 macrodomain hydrolyzes ADP-ribose groups from mono(ADP-ribosyl)ated\nproteins and the activity of nsP3 mono(ADP-ribosyl)hydrolase is somewhere\ndecisive for CHIKV replication and virulence in mice. At the N-terminus,\nnsP3 encompasses a very preserved MacroD-type macrodomain. The protein\nfold in the macrodomain is remarkably conserved, which is present\nin numerous plus-strand RNA viruses, and it attaches to ADP-ribose.\nMutant viruses missing hydrolase activity were incapable of replicating\nin mammalian BHK-21 cells or mosquito, A. albopictus, cells and quickly regressed the catalytically inactivated mutants.\n\nDespite the increasing number of chikungunya patients, haplessly,\nto date, no antiviral remedy or vaccine is available in the market\nfor the cure of CHIKV-infected patients. Some CHIKV vaccine approaches\nhave been analyzed, together with inefficient, live weakened, and\nDNA chimeric vaccines. However, questions associated with protection\nand efficiency have stalled the development of current vaccine entrants.19,20 Besides, drugs testified via in vitro screening of chloroquine,\nribavirin, and arbidol to curb CHIKV progress have failed to produce\nnoteworthy therapeutic aids in clinical samples.21\u221224 In the recent past, high-throughput\nassays have been established to figure out probable inhibitors of\nCHIKV. Literature search has provided the information regarding analysis\nof 356 natural product molecules and clinically recommended medicines\nto counteract CHIKV replicon, and an accompanying test with the surrogate\ninfection model of Semliki Forest virus (SFV),25 during analyses of 3040 small compounds as inhibitors of\nCHIKV nsP2, was also tested by the phenotypic assay protocol.26 Still, the problem for the prevention and treatment\nof\nCHIKV fever is recalcitrant. Therefore, it is necessary to work in\na streamlined manner to overcome this severe menace.\n\nFlavones\nare naturally occurring polyphenolic secondary metabolites that exist\nall over in plants. They have shown enormous potential in the field\nof medicinal chemistry.27 They are very\nbeneficial in our daily life28 to boost\nup immunity and can be used as a preventive measure for various ailments,\nby consuming flavone-rich products such as green tea, fruits, etc.\nIn our laboratory, we had prepared naturally occurring rugosaflavonoid\nand its derivatives.29,30 Before formation of rugosaflavonoids,\nwe had\nobtained dihydrorugosaflavonoids (Scheme 1).30,31 We had screened these\ncompounds for tuberculosis in our previous studies, and we found that\nhalogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids were much better antitubercular\nagents than rugosaflavonoids.31\n\nDue to nonavailability of the antiviral drug\nagainst CHIKV, mostly natural compounds have been subjected to screening\nfor antiviral activity to obtain lead molecules using high-throughput\nassays.32\u221235 Therefore, in this study, we have checked the antiviral potential\nof our compounds against the CHIKV. First, using molecular docking,\nthe target site for the compounds was identified in CHIKV. The non-structural\nviral proteins have a crucial role in the replication and survival\nof CHIKV. Among nsP1\u2013nsP4, nsP3 has a natural ligand ADP-ribose\nthat binds to its macrodomain, which is highly conserved.36 The docking of these compounds into the nsP3\nmacrodomain indicated that the halogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids\ninteracted and fitted more effectively in its pocket. This binding\nproperty of halogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids with nsP3 invigorated\nus to screen these compounds for antiviral efficacy against CHIKV.\n\nIn this study, the docking potential of dihydrorugosaflavonoid\nderivatives with the macrodomain of nsP3 and their antiviral potential\nagainst CHIKV are reported. Based on the outcomes of antiviral screening\nusing CHIKV-infected Vero cells, the dihydrorugosaflavonoids were\nassessed with several assays. The cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition\nand plaque reduction assays were conducted to determine the inhibitory\npotential of compounds on CHIKV replication, and quantitative real-time\npolymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to assess the reduction\nof viral RNA levels in the infected cells. An immunofluorescence assay\n(IFA) was carried out to investigate the reduction in CHIKV antigen\nupon treatment with the screened compounds.\n\nThe dihydrorugosaflavonoid moiety has three\nrings A, B, and C (Figure 1).30,31 All of the synthesized compounds\nhave dissimilarities in ring B. The ring A has a hydroxyl group at\nthe 7th position and an ester group at the 5th position.\nRest of the changes are only in ring B with differently substituted\nbenzene. They were obtained during the synthesis of analogues of rugosaflavonoid\n(6a\u2013f) as an intermediate before\nthe synthesis of the final product (Scheme 1).31\n\nAs per Gaspar et al.,27 flavonoids are still a valid scaffold in medicinal chemistry. Recently,\nLani et al. have published the antiviral potential of baicalein and\nfisetin against CHIKV.34 These compounds\npossessed the same backbone, so it was pertinent to check their inhibitory\npotential for CHIKV. Recently, the synthesis of these compounds has\nbeen reported by our group.30 All of the\nspectral data have been provided in the Supporting Information (Supporting Information File 1).\n\nThe nsP3 has three key domains, a central zinc-binding region,\na very conserved N-terminal macrodomain, and a poorly conserved, not\nproperly structured acidic and highly phosphorylated C-terminal domain.\nThe functions of various cellular proteins to influence signaling,\nstress granule assembly, and viral replication are controlled by the\nC-terminal domain.35,36 The exact role of the central\nzinc-binding region and N-terminal macrodomain is not well categorized.\nMacrodomains are known to have a conserved protein fold detected from\narchaea to higher eukaryotes considered for their affinity to the\nsmall molecule ADP-ribose and its analogues. In positive-strand RNA\nviruses such as alphaviruses, coronaviruses, and hepatitis E virus,\nthe macrodomains are the integral part of the nsPs.37\u221246 According to Rungrotmongkol et al.,47 the molecular understanding of the particular binding of ADP-ribose\nto the CHIKV nsP3 macrodomain revealed that nsP3 amino acids Asp 10,\nIle 11, Asn 24, Asp 31, Gly 32, Val 33, Cys 34, Ser 110\u2013Tyr\n114, Val 133, and Arg 144 act as the critical residues in the binding\npocket, which make molecular contacts with the ligand. Also, the ribose\nand diphosphate units of the ADP-ribose were found to play a significant\nrole in making molecular contacts with the amino acid residues of\nnsP3 in the CHIKV nsP3\u2013ADP-ribose complex (Figure 2a,b).\n\nThe chloro derivative of dihydrorugosaflavonoid\n(5c) showed interaction of halogen with Arg 144 (Figure 2c). The carbonyl\noxygen of ring C formed hydrogen bonds with Ser 110, Thr 111, and\nGly 112. Asp 10 and Ile 11 are also nearby. Val 33 interacted with\nring oxygen. 5c also showed bonding with Leu 109. Thr\n114 interacted with the carboxylate group attached with ring A. All\nof these amino acid residues of the binding pocket are critical and\nare also active in the binding of nsp3 macrodomain with ADP-ribose\n(Table 2).\n\nThe\nbromo derivative of rugosaflavonoid (5d) showed binding\nin the potential site pocket of the nsp3 macrodomain and showed interactions\nwith Asn 24, Gly 112, and Asp 31 (Figure 2d). The docking scores of 5c and 5d were found to be \u22127.54 and \u22126.86\nkcal mol\u20131, respectively (Table 1). These effective binding interactions (Table 2) indicate that these compounds may interfere with the function\nof nsP3 macrodomain and thus inhibit the replication of CHIKV. Therefore,\nto evaluate the inhibitory potential of halogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids\nagainst CHIKV, the antiviral assays were performed using Vero cell\nlines by observing the cytopathic effect (CPE), plaque reduction assay,\nthe quantification of the viral genome RNA by qRT-PCR, and using immunofluorescence\nimaging.\n\nIn the process of drug discovery development,\nvarious rules were considered but suffered various limitations.48 Therefore, a combination of pharmacodynamics\n(PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK), which explains the interaction of\nan organism with the drug, is important to be studied. PD evaluates\nwhat the drug does to the body, and PK explains how body responds\nto the drug. The main\ncomponents of PK are absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion\n(ADME), finally associated with toxicity (ADMET). Although ADME properties\nexplain the utmost pharmacological performance of small molecules,\nthe toxicology study\nensures no injury to the organism with no side effects. According\nto Hodgson, \u201cA chemical cannot be a drug, no matter how active\nnor how specific its action, unless it is also taken appropriately\ninto the body (absorption), distributed to the right parts of the\nbody, metabolized in a way that does not instantly remove its activity,\nand eliminated in a suitable manner\u2014a drug must get in, move\nabout, hang around, and then get out\u201d.49 Haplessly, to address all of these parameters is time-consuming\nand cumbersome due to the intricacy of human body, where all of these\nparameters affect each other. It has not only limitations to interactions\nwithin the body but also several restrictions due to gender, age,\ngenetic state, disease, etc. In this case, in silico technologies\ncan be helpful to compute these calculations based on the mathematical\nalgorithm used in the in silico software. Although it does not give\nfull guaranty that it is going to work 100% in the living system,\nit saves our time in the selection of molecule to be considered for\nfurther studies. Therefore, ADME/T properties were studied using Qikprop\nsoftware of Maestro.\n\nIn Table 3,31 values of parameters\nsuch as QP log Po/w, QP log HERG, QPP\nCaco, QP log BB, QPP MDCK, QP log Kp,\nQP log Khsa, and percentage of human oral\nabsorption are shown for compounds 5a\u2013f. QP log Po/w reports the expected octanol/water partition\ncoefficient. Its range should be \u22122 to 6.5. The values for 5a\u2013f obtained were between 2.2 and 2.7.\nQP log HERG predicts IC50 values for the\nblockage of HERG K+ channels. Its defined range is above \u22125.0.\nThe values obtained for dihydrorugosaflavonids were between \u22124.7\nand \u22124.8, which are above \u22125.0. QPP Caco gives an idea\nabout the apparent Caco-2 cell permeability in nm s\u20131. The Caco-2 cell is a model for the gut\u2013blood barrier. Below\n25, it is considered as poor, and above 500, it is considered as significantly\ngood. Its computational values for compounds 5a\u2013f were found to be between 318 and 411, which are not great\nbut not poor also. QP log BB calculates the brain\u2013blood partition\ncoefficient. Its acceptable range is \u22123 to 1.2. The compounds\n(5a\u2013f) under study showed these values\nfrom \u22121.13 to \u22120.76. QPP MDCK predicts apparent MDCK\ncell permeability in nm s\u20131/MDCK cell, which is\nidentified to be a good\nimitator for the blood\u2013brain barrier. Its acceptable range\nis 25\u2013500. Its values for dihydrorugosaflavonoids (5a\u2013f) were obtained between 150 and 465. QP log\nKP predicts the skin permeability. Its acceptable range is \u22128\nto \u22121.0. For compounds 5a\u2013f, its values were obtained between \u22122.9 and \u22122.1. QP log Khsa predicts affinity toward human serum albumin. Its tolerable\nlimit is \u22121.5 to 1.5. For compounds 5a\u2013f, its values ranged between 0.68 and 0.207. It is mentioned\nthat the percentage of human oral absorption range of 25% is weak\nand 80% is significant. For compounds 5a\u2013f, these values were obtained between 88.32 and 90.67. These\nresults support that the compounds have all of the values in the acceptable\nrange.\n\nThe tetrazolium-based cell\nviability assay was conducted to investigate and detect the maximum\nnontoxic dose (MNTD) for both the compounds 5c and 5d. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium\nbromide (MTT) assay is dependent on the reaction of water-soluble\ncompound (MTT) with an insoluble formazan product by viable cells\nwith active metabolic activity. Thus, the color produced due to the\nformation of formazan is a suitable marker of only viable cells. Different\nconcentrations of the 5c and 5d compounds\nwere assessed by MTT assay at 24 h. Both compounds did not display\ntoxicity up to 85 \u03bcM as >70% of Vero cells were viable (Figure 3a,b). Half-maximal\ncytotoxicity (CC50) was calculated from the plotted graph\nand represented as a dotted line. So, all of the antiviral assays\nwere performed using 30\u201370 \u03bcM concentration of both the\ncompounds.\n\nAfter evaluation of MNTD for both the compounds, the different non-cytotoxic\nconcentrations of 5c and 5d compounds were\nscreened on virus-infected Vero cells to find out the possible effects\nof the compounds. Viral-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) assay was\nevaluated at 48 hpi (Supporting Information File 1). The compounds 5c and 5d exhibited\na significant reduction of CHIKV-induced CPE at less than 70 \u03bcM\nconcentration.\n\nThe reduction in the CHIKV infectivity\nin the presence of 5c and 5d compounds was\nassessed by plaque reduction assay. In the case of 5c-compound-treated CHIKV, virus inhibition was observed nearly up\nto 95% at 70 \u03bcM, 88% at 50 \u03bcM, and 80% at 30 \u03bcM\nconcentration, while 5d-treated-CHIKV showed 92% at 70\n\u03bcM, 86% at 50 \u03bcM, and 84% at 30 \u03bcM, as compared\nto control (Figure 3). Other compounds (5a, 5b, 5e, and 5f) did not show inhibition of CHIKV.\n\nThe\neffective concentration (EC50) of 5c and 5d was determined from antiviral curves. The EC50 of 5c compound was 26.14 \u03bcM (Figure 4a) with a selectivity index (CC50/EC50) of 4.33 (CC50 = 113.4 \u03bcM (Figure 3a)). The EC50 of 5d compound was 28.39 \u03bcM (Figure 4b; selectivity index = 4.19; CC50 = 119 \u03bcM (Figure 3b)). The reported EC50 values are the means of\ntwo experiments, which are performed in triplicates. It clearly shows\nthat 4\u2032-halogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids (5c and 5d) possess better inhibitory potential than other\nsubstituted dihydrorugosaflavonoid compounds for CHIKV.\n\nConventional RT-PCR methods\nare still one of the reliable diagnostic methods for studying viral\nload in supernatants and clinical samples. Here, qRT-PCR was used\nfor validating the antiviral effect of 5c and 5d by quantifying CHIKV RNA levels in the infected cells. The reduction\nin the viral RNA level was observed when treated with 5c and 5d compounds at 24 hpi. The CHIKV RNA levels upon\ntreatment with 70 and 50 \u03bcM 5c were reduced to\nclosely 95 and 90%, respectively, whereas in case of 5d, with 70 and 50 \u03bcM, the RNA levels of CHIKV were reduced to\n\u223c 93 and 91%, respectively (Figure 5).\n\nImmunofluorescence staining\nallows rapid diagnosis of viral antigen in the infected cell using\nmonoclonal antibodies against the virus-specific antigen. One of the\ntwo envelope glycoproteins present in the chikungunya virus named\nE2 glycoprotein has been used as the viral antigen in this study for\nvirus detection by IFA. Here, CHIKV at an MOI of 1 was propagated\nin Vero cells for 36 h with 5c and 5d compounds\nat 70 and 50 \u03bcM concentrations. IFA measured detection of the\nintracellular virus\nwith an envelope-specific monoclonal antibody (E2 mAb). Additionally,\nno E2-expression was visualized in a negative control sample, while\nCHIKV-infected cells were positive for E2-expression. Figure 6 clearly shows that both 5c and 5d compounds inhibited CHIKV at 70 and\n50 \u03bcM concentrations.\n\nDue to nonavailability of an antiviral drug or\nvaccine against CHIKV, various approaches have been considered all\nover the world to identify the lead molecules restricting CHIKV infection\nor replication. In this piece of work, molecular docking of dihydrorugosaflavonoids\nwith nsP3 showed their interaction with the key residues of nsP3 that\nbind ADP, which supports the possibility and indicates that these\ncompounds are potential antivirals for CHIKV. This is confirmed in\nthis study by performing various antiviral assays. The CPE and plaque\nreduction assay displayed that compounds 5c and 5d potentially inhibit CHIKV infection. Further, qRT-PCR assay\nresults clearly show the potential of these two compounds in the suppression\nof viral RNA levels in infected cells. Furthermore, the antiviral\nactivity of dihydrorugosaflavonoids toward CHIKV is also well delivered\nby IFA.\n\nFlavonoid compounds have received many\nrewards\nby showing their potential in medicinal chemistry. Dihydrorugosaflavonoids\nbelong to the same class and display their potential to inhibit CHIKV\nreplication. In conclusion, it could be explicated that halogenated\ndihydrorugosaflavonoids with the appropriate modifications are deserving\ncandidates for additional study to find out the accurate facts of\ntheir mechanism of action and effective anti-CHIKV therapeutics.\n\nAll of the chemicals utilized during\nthe reactions were obtained from Spectrochem, India. 1H\nNMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature\non Varian 400 MHz and 100 MHz spectrometers, respectively. Chemical\nshift values were\ndisplayed with reference to TMS as an internal standard. DMSO-d6 was used as the solvent to prepare the samples.\nChemical shifts were expressed in \u03b4 (ppm) and coupling constants\n(J) in Hertz. The splitting pattern abbreviations\nare as follows: s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; m,\nunresolved multiplet; dd, doublet of the doublet. Column chromatography\nwas performed with Merck silica gel 60 (230\u2013400 mesh). Analytical\nthin-layer chromatography was carried out using Merck silica gel 60F254, and iodine was used as a developing reagent. IR spectra\nwere recorded on an FTIR IR Affinity-1 Shimadzu spectrophotometer.\nThe CHNS analysis was recorded on Elementar Vario El-III.\n\nProtein (nsP3 PDB code: 3GPO) preparation\nwas performed using Maestro 11.2 software by the protocol in our earlier\npublished paper.31 The protein was taken\nfrom the RCSB site (www.rcsb.org)\n\nThe dihydrorugosaflavonoid derivatives\n(5a\u2013f) were designated as ligands.\nThe ligands were suitably prepared using the Ligprep tool of the same\nsoftware. The protocol was followed as per the reported procedure.31\n\nThe GLIDE tool was used for\nthe generation of receptor grid in 3GPO. The protocol was followed\nas per the procedure reported by Puranik et al.31\n\nMolecular docking of 3GPO with\ndihydrorugosaflavonoids was established with the help of Glide tool.\nThis computation study was carried out as per the protocol reported.31\n\nADME properties\nof ligand molecules were obtained by the QikProp tool of Schrodinger\n2017, which delivered information about absorption, distribution,\nmetabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADME/T) properties of the ligands.\nIt provided data such as QP log Po/w, QP log BB,\noverall CNS activity, Caco-2, MDCK cell permeability, log Khsa for human serum albumin binding, percentage of human oral\nabsorption, etc. The method was conducted as per the protocol published.31\n\nAll of the compounds 5a\u2013f and their intermediates were synthesized as per the procedure\nreported in our previous published paper.31 The details are provided in Supporting Information File 1.\n\nVero cells (NCCS, Pune, India) were\nmaintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM;\nHiMedia, India) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine\nserum (FBS; Gibco), 100 units of penicillin, and 100 mg of streptomycin/mL\nat 37 \u00b0C and in a 5% CO2 incubator. Using the virus\nadsorption technique, CHIKV (accession number, KY057363.1; strain,\n119067)50 stocks were prepared in Vero\ncells and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until needed. By using the\nplaque-forming assay, the virus titer is calculated. Plaque-forming\nunit per milliliter (PFU/mL) was used to quantify the virus titer.\n\nThe cytotoxicity of 5c and 5d compounds for Vero cells was measured using\nMTT (Sigma) in a 96-well plate format. Stocks of 5c and 5d compounds were prepared by dissolving in dimethyl sulfoxide\n(DMSO), and the working concentration was prepared by further diluting\nin culture media. At 90% confluency, the media were removed, and media\ncontaining different dilutions of compounds were added into each well.\nWells with 0.1% DMSO were considered as control. After 24 h, MTT was\nadded to each\n96-well in a volume of 20 \u03bcL of 5 mg mL\u20131 stock\nand\nincubated for 4 h at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2. Upon completion\nof incubation, DMSO was added to dissolve formazan crystals. The absorbance\nwas read at a wavelength of 570 nm using citation three\nmulti-mode plate reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc.). The experiment\nwas done in triplicates.\n\nVero cells were seeded\nonto a 24-well plate at a cell density of 2 \u00d7 105 cells/well.\nCells were treated with compounds 12 h prior to infection (before\ninfection). At MOI of 1, the cell monolayer was infected with CHIKV\nwith gentle shaking after every 15 min for 90 min. The inoculum was\ndiscarded, and the cell monolayer was washed twice to ensure that\nthere is no chance of secondary infection. Compounds were also added\nin the post-infection media containing DMEM with 2% FBS for 24 h (after\ninfection). Infected cells were incubated with 0.1% DMSO as the negative\ncontrol. After 24 hpi, the supernatant was collected for determining\nvirus titer by plaque-forming assay. After collecting the supernatant,\nTRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added (as per manufacturer\u2019s\nprotocol) to the adherent cells in a 24-well plate to isolate RNA\nfor qRT-PCR. Furthermore, the CPE of CHIKV on the Vero cell line appeared\nin \u223c48 h after the cell infection. Hence, the effect of inhibitory\ncompounds on the CPE was observed after 48 hpi with an inverted light\nmicroscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany). Dose\u2013response cell viability\nand antiviral curves were used to determine EC50 and CC50. The ratio of CC50/EC50 is the selectivity\nindex, which gave an idea of the therapeutic window of the dihydrorugosaflavonoid\ncompounds.\n\nTo perform the plaque assay\nfor measuring the virus titer, a Vero cell monolayer was seeded in\n24-well plates at 2 \u00d7 105 cells per well. 5c and 5d compound treatment and infection were the same\nas described in the assessment of antiviral activity. The final DMSO\nconcentration in both the compounds was 0.01% v/v. The infected cells\nwere treated with varying concentrations of each compound in DMEM\nwith 2% FBS and incubated at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 for\n24 h. At 24 hpi, the cell supernatant was harvested, and the 10-fold\nserial-diluted CHIKV supernatant was added to the Vero cells and incubated\nat 37 \u00b0C for 90 min while the untreated but virus-infected cells\nwere taken as control. Afterward, cells were overlaid with 1% carboxymethyl\ncellulose in MEM with 2% FBS and incubated at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. After 48 h, the overlay medium was discarded, then the cells\nwere fixed with 10% formaldehyde for 2 h, and cells were stained with\n1% crystal violet solution for plaque visualization.\n\nDose\u2013response\ncurves were generated by measuring percent inhibition in the plaque\nreduction assay for a particular range of compound concentrations.\nVarying concentrations of each compound were used to generate inhibition\ncurves for calculating the 50% effective concentration (EC50). EC50 of each compound was calculated by plotting the\ngraph of percent inhibition of the compound at different concentrations\nvs. compound concentration. The plaque reduction assay was performed\nin triplicates for a particular concentration of the compound and\nwas repeated twice to verify the constant inhibition results.\n\nVero cells were seeded\nonto 12-well plates at a cell density of 4 \u00d7 105 cells\nper well.16,175c and 5d compounds\u2019\ntreatment and infection were the same as described in the assessment\nof antiviral activity. For quantification of viral genome after 24\nh of incubation with or without the compound, the supernatant was\ndiscarded and trizol was added to the plate. RNA was purified according\nto the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Purified RNA was treated with\nDNAse to remove any traces of genomic DNA (Promega) and then subsequently\nused for cDNA preparation using the AccuScript high fidelity cDNA\nsynthesis kit (Agilent) with 1 \u03bcg of extracted RNA. The forward\nand reverse primers used for amplification51,52 are given in Table 4.\n\nNegative and positive controls were included for PCR\namplification. Nuclease-free water was used instead of the RNA sample\nas a negative control to screen possible contamination. RNA extracted\nfrom the untreated CHIKV supernatant was used as a positive control.\nExperiments were done in triplicate and repeated twice for accuracy\nof the result. PCR runs were carried out according to the standard\nKAPA SYBR fast universal qPCR kit on a QuantStudio 5 System (Applied\nBiosystems, Carlsbad, CA). The cycling conditions are as follows:\n95 \u00b0C for 20 s and then 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 1 s and 60\n\u00b0C for 20 s. Fluorescence was detected after each cycle. To analyze\ndata, fold change difference between control samples and compound-treated\nsamples was calculated using \u0394\u0394Ct values.\n\nVero cells were seeded onto\na 6-well plate at a cell density of 1 \u00d7 106 cells\nper well. Cells were treated with 70 and 50 \u03bcM concentrations\nof 5c and 5d compounds prior to and after\nCHIKV\ninfection. At 36 hpi, cells were washed three times with PBS and then\nfixed with methanol:acetone (1:1) for 1 h at room temperature followed\nby permeabilization with 0.1% Triton-X-100. After washing, cells were\nincubated with antibodies against CHIKV, i.e., anti-alphavirus (1:100,\nSANTA Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), for 1 h and then incubated with fluorescein\n(FITC)-conjugated secondary anti-mouse antibody (1:250, Sigma) for\n30 min at 37 \u00b0C. The plate was then rinsed with PBS and counter-stained\nwith DAPI (Sigma) for 15 min. Then, the image was captured by two\ntrained persons, under a fluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems).\nAll experiments were repeated thrice to verify the results."}
