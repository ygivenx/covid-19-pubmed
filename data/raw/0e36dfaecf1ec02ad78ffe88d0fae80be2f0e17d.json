{"title": "Toona sinensis: a comprehensive review on its traditional usages, phytochemisty, pharmacology and toxicology", "body": "Toona sinensis (Juss.) M.Roem [synonyms: Cedrela sinensis Juss, xi\u0101ngch\u016bn (in Chinese)], belonging to Meliaceae family and popularly known as Chinese toon or Chinese mahogany, is a deciduous woody plant native to eastern and southeastern Asia (Liao et al., 2009) . T. sinensis has a cultivation history more than 2000 years and is used as a vegetable source in China and Malaysia, and as animal fodder in India (Liao et al., 2007) . T. sinensis is also widely used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and various parts tissues of this plant have been used for a wide variety of diseases. The stems and leaves of TSR are traditionally used for the treatment of dysentery, enteritis, carminative and itchiness, etc. (Dong et al., 2013) . The roots are used as correctives, the bark is used as astringent and depurative, and the fruits are used as astringent for the treatment of eye infections (Perry, 1980) . Previous phytochemical investigations on this plant have revealed that the main constituents include terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids and anthraquinones (Feng et al., 2007; Mu et al., 2007; Hsieh et al., 2008) . Modern researches have also reported that T. sinensis possessed various pharmaco- good anti-inflammatory, detoxifying and hemostatic effects, and thus this plant was commonly used to treat enteritis, dysentery, urinary tract infection, leukorrheal diseases and skin itch (Anonymous, 1977 (Anonymous, , 1999 Li et al., 2006) . Furthermore, due to its special onion-like flavor and wealth of carotene and vitamins B and C, the edible leaves and young shoots of T. sinensis are also delicious and nutritious food stuff in China and other Southeast Asia countries (Anonymous, 1999; Dong et al., 2013a) .\n\nIn the early 1970s, compounds such as toosendanin (1), sterol and vitamins have been reported from the leaves and barks of T. sinensis in China (Anonymous, 1972) . From then on, the phytochemical constituents of T. sinensis have been comprehensively investigated. So far, over one hundred compounds have been isolated and identified from this plant, including terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, and flavonoids. In this section, we described the main chemical components of T. sinensis, the corresponding isolation parts of these compounds were also concluded in Box 1.\n\nAs well known that, special perfume is one of the characteristics of T. sinensis plant, thus previous researchers have investigated the volatile oils of this plant. For extraction of volatile oils from T. sinensis, the hydro-distillation and headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) are commonly used, and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is often used to identify the composition of volatile oil (Chen et al., 2009a; Li and Wang, 2014) . Nowadays, over forty volatile components were isolated and identified from the tender shoots and leaves of T. sinensis. These constituents are mainly sesquiterpenes hydrocarbons, including caryophyllenes, \u2424-caryophyllenes, copaenes and \u2424-eudesmenes (Chen et al., 2009a; Dong et al., 2013b; Wu et al., 2014) .\n\nNatural products is a large resource for finding novel structures for candidate drugs, and more than 40% of the marketed drugs are derived from the secondary metabolites in plant. Among them, the terpenoids are prominent secondary metabolites for discovering new candidate drugs with wide spectrum of activities, including hepatoprotective, antiviral, anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-tumor agents (James and Dubery, 2009; Zhou et al., 2017) .\n\nIt is reported that this plant contains abundant terpenoids, and toosendanin (1) is the first triterpenoid isolated from this plant in 1972 (Anonymous, 1972) . Till now, 59 terpenoids (including triterpenoids, diterpenes and sesquiterpenes) have been isolated from the leaves, shoots, barks and roots of T. sinensis, and limonoids triterpenoids are the characteristic constituents of T. sinensis (Box 1). The predominant terpenoids of this plant are the triterpenoids and include 3oxo-12-en-28-oic acid (2) , \u2423-betulin (3) (Dong et al., 2013a) , ursolic acid (4), betulonic acid (5), betulic acid (6) , 11\u2423-hydroxygedunin (7), 11\u2424hydroxygedunin (8), 7-deacetoxy-7\u2423,11\u2423-dihydroxygedunin (9), 7-deacetoxy-7\u2423,11\u2424-dihydroxygedunin (10), gedunin (11), 7-deacetoxy-7\u2423-hydroxygedunin (12) (Mitsui et al., 2006) , 7deacetylgedunin (13) (Chen et al., 2017) , 11-oxo-gedunin (14) (Mitsui et al., 2006) , toonins A (15), proceranone (16) (Dong et al., 2013a) , 6-acetoxyobacunol acetate (17), 7\u2423-obacunyl acetate, 7\u2423-acetoxy-dihydronomilin (18) (Luo et al., 2000) , 11\u2424hydroxy-7\u2423-obacunyl acetate (19), 11-oxo-7\u2423-obacunyl acetate (20), 11-oxo-7\u2423-obacunol (21), 11\u2424-hydroxycneorin G (22), 11\u2424oxocneorin G (23) (Mitsui et al., 2004) , cedrellin (24) (Luo et al., 2000) , toonins B (25) (Dong et al., 2013a) , grandifoliolenone (26) (Mitsui et al., 2007) , bourjotinolone A (27) (Dong et al., 2013a) , toona triterpenoids A (28), B (29), piscidinol A (30), hispidol B (31) (Mitsui et al., 2007) , 20-hydroxy-24-dammaren-3-one (32), (20S)-3-oxo-tirucalla-25-nor-7-en-24-oic acid (33), (20S)-5\u2423,8\u2423-epidioxy-3-oxo-24-nor-6.9(11)-dien-23-oic acid (34), ocotillone (35), (20S,24R)-epoxydammarane-12.25-diol-3-one (36), (20S,24R)-epoxydammarane-3\u2424,25-diolmarane-3\u2424,25-diol (Mitsui et al., 2007) , and toosendanin (1) (Anonymous, 1972) .\n\nFurthermore, there are also other terpenoids reported in this T. sinensis, including phytol (53), 2,6,10-phytatriene-1,14,15-triol (Luo et al., 2000) , (2E,6E,10E)-3,7,11,15-tetramethylhexadeca-2,6-10-triene-1,14,15-triol, eudesm-4(15)-ene-1\u2424,6\u2423-diol (54) (Hou et al., 2011) .\n\nPhenylpropanoids, including lignins and coumarins, commonly exist in natural plants, and these compounds often have some interesting activities such as antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and antitumor activities (de Souza et al., 2016; Hassan et al., 2016; Figueiredo et al., 2017) .\n\nSo far, nine phenylpropanoids have been found in the leaves, fruits and roots of T. sinensis, and these constituents were identified as cedralins A (55), B (56) (Lee et al., 2010) , toonins C (63), matairesinol (58), lyoniresinol (59) (Dong et al., 2013a) , scopoletin (60) (Luo et al., 2001) , 4,7-dimethoxy-5-methylcoumarin (61) (Shen et al., 2013) , and ficusesquilignans A (62), B (63) (Hou et al., 2011) .\n\nFlavonoids are common constituents in various plants all over the world. There were thirteen flavonoids in different parts of T. sinensis which were isolated and identified as (+)-catechin (64), (\u2212)-epicatechin (65) (Park et al., 1996) , procyanidin B3 (66) (Kakumu et al., 2014) , procyanidin B4 (Zhao et al., 2009) , quercetin, quercitrin (Zhang et al., 2001) , isoquercitrin (67), rutin (Park et al., 1996) , kaempferol (Luo et al., 2001) , kaempferol-3-O-\u2423-lrhamopyranoside (68) (Hou et al., 2011) , astragalin (69) (Shen et al., 2013) , myricetin (70), myricitrin (71) (Li et al., 2006) (Cheng et al., 2009 ), astragalin-2 -O-gallate (73), loropetalin D (74) (Kakumu et al., 2014) , 6,7,8,2 -tetramethoxy-5,6 -dihydroxy-flavone (75), and 5,7dihydroxy-8-methoxy flavone (76) (Luo et al., 2001) .\n\nBesides these compounds mentioned above, there are also other compounds, including phenols, sterols, anthraquinones, tannins, and sulfocompounds reported in T. sinensis. These constituents are identified as bis-(p-hydroxyphenyl) ether (Park et al., 1996) , gallic acid , methyl gallate (Park et al., 1996) , ethyl gallate (Luo et al., 2001) , syringic acid (Dong et al., 2013a) , 3,5-dihydroxy-phenylether (Hou et al., 2011) , 4-methoxy-6-(2 ,4 -dihydroxy-6 -methylphenyl)-pyran-2-one (77), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzene-ethanol (Dong et al., 2013a) , 3\u2423-hydroxy-5, 6-epoxy-7-megastigmen-9-one (78) (Luo et al., 2001) , aloeemodin (Dong et al., 2013a) , \u2424-sitosterol (Li et al., 2006) , daucosterol , 1,2,6-tri-O-galloyl-\u2424-d-glucopyranose (79) (Cheng et al., 2009) , 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-\u2424-d-glucopyranose (80) (Shen et al., 2013) , (S,S)-\u2425-glutamyl-(cis-S-1-propenyl) thioglycine (81), (S,S)-\u2425-glutamyl-(trans-S-1-propenyl)thioglycine (82), \u2425-glutamyl-(cis-S-1-propenyl)-cysteine (83), \u2425-glutamyl-(trans-S-1-propenyl)-cysteine, cis-S-1-propenyl-l-cysteine (84), trans-S-1-propenyl-l-cysteine , and adenosine (85) (Park et al., 1996) .\n\nPrevious investigations have comprehensively considered the pharmacological activities of T. sinensis and reported that this plant possesses various pharmacological activities including anti-tumor, hypoglycemic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, protecting effect on ischemia-reperfusion injury, hepatoprotective, antibacterial and antiviral, anti-gout effect, male reproductive system protection, and anticoagulation effects (Box 2).\n\nToona sinensis is a known TCM with the function of heat-clearing and detoxifying, and anti-tumor effects are important pharmacological activities of T. sinensis which have been comprehensively investigated, including leukemia, lung cancer, oral carcinoma, cervical carcinoma, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, gastric cancer, colon cancer, and breast cancer .\n\nBy using MTT assays in vitro, Chen et al. (2011a) found that ethyl acetate extracts of T. sinensis (ACTSL) significantly inhibited the proliferation of leukemia K562 cell line with the IC 50 was 102.53 g/ml. Later in 2012, it is reported that water extracts of T. sinensis (TSL) could arrest leukemia HL-60 cells at G1-S transition phase and down-regulate VEGF (Huang et al., 2012) . In 2016, research of Yang et al. (2017) found that TSL (50 mg/kg) had notable antitumor effect against leukemia in WEHI-3 cells bearing mice. Furthermore, it is reported that many interesting compounds isolated from the T. sinensis possess promising antitumor effects against leukemia, including cedralin A (55) (IC 50 was 26.2 g/ml), loropetalin D (74) (IC 50 was 22.4 g/ml) (Lee et al., 2010) , quercetin, quercitrin, afzelin, astragalin 2 -O-gallate (73), (+)-catechin (64) (Kakumu et al., 2014) and gallic acid (Huang et al., 2012; Kakumu et al., 2014) . In 2010, using lung cancer cell lines including human lung adenocarcinoma H441 cell line, human lung squamous cell carcinoma H520 cell line, and human lung large cell carcinoma cell line H661, Wang et al. and Yang et al. reported that TSL possess notable antitumor potentials against lung cancer cell lines via cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and the IC 50 values were 1.2, 0.73 and 0.29 mg/ml for H441, H520 and H661 cells, respectively Yang et al., 2010a,b) .\n\nIn 2011, reported that ACTSL had the antitumor potential against gastric cancer SGC-7901 cell line with the IC 50 value of 168.47 g/ml. Later in 2013, Yang et al. (2013) reported betulonic acid (5) and 3-oxo-12-en-28-oic acid (2) isolated from T. sinensis inhibited the proliferation of gastric cancer MGC-803 (IC 50 were 17.7 and 13.6 M) and prostatic cancer PC3 cell lines (IC 50 were 26.5 and 21.9 M). Interestingly, gallic acid isolated from T. sinensis is also an important agent against prostatic cancer DU145 cells via inducing generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis; furthermore, gallic acid also showed a synergistic effect with doxorubicin in inhibiting DU145 cells' growth .\n\nWater extracts of T. sinensis and gallic acid were also reported to be active agents against oral carcinoma via inducing apoptosis. Chang et al. (2006) reported that TSL induced apoptosis of human ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells and inhibits tumor growth in SKOV3 cells xenograft model. Zhen et al. (2014) found that TSL could induce cell cycle arrest in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells via apoptosis. In 2016, it is reported that TSL inhibited the growth and migration of renal carcinoma ccRCC cells via inducing apoptosis . Recently, Chen et al. (2017b) revealed that TSL caused significant cytotoxicity in osteosarcoma Saos-2 cell in vivo and in vitro via inducing apoptosis (IC 50 was 42.8-52.3 g/ml in vitro, 1 g/kg and 5 g/kg on Saos-2 cell bearing mice).\n\nAdditionally, TSL was also reported to be an active agent against colon cancer Caco-2 cell, human liver cancer HepG2 cell and breast cancer MCF-7 cell lines, and the IC 50 values were 4.0, 153. 16 and 193.46 g/ml, respectively (Liu et al., 2012) .\n\nCurrently, increasing researches have demonstrated that extracts/constituents from the T. sinensis have promising hypoglycemic potentials, which would be beneficial for the diabetes patients. In 2003, the research team of Yang et al. (2003) reported that ethanol extracts of T. sinensis leaf (ETSL) could enhance the cellular glucose uptake in basal and insulin stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In 2015, Liu et al. (2015) revealed that the mechanisms of TSL stimulating glucose uptake and ameliorating insulin resistance might be related to AMPK activation in skeletal muscles and up-regulation of PPAR\u2425 and normalized adiponectin in adipose tissues. In 2005, the inhibitory effect of TSL on LDL glycation induced by glucose and glyoxal was reported (Hsieh et al., 2005) . It was also indicated that TSL could alleviate hyperglycemia via altering adipose glucose transporter 4 , and results of Zhang et al. (2008 Zhang et al. ( , 2011 indicated that total flavonoids of T. sinensis (FTSL) might be the active constituents corresponding to the hypoglycemic effects of this plant. Furthermore, it is reported that extracts of the seeds of T. sinensis (STSL) has hypoglycemic and kidney protecting effects in diabetic rats (Du et al., 2011; Li et al., 2016) , and Xing and Chen found that total polyphenols from the seeds of T. sinensis (TPST) could inhibit hepatic injury at early stage in diabetic rats (Xing and Chen, 2011) . In 2012, Hsieh et al. (2012) indicated the supercritical-CO 2 fluid extracted non-polar leaves extract of T. sinensis (NPTSL) could prevent the progression of type 2 diabetes. Besides, Zhao et al. (2009) reported that in this plant, gallic acid, (+)catechin (64), (\u2212)-epicatechin (65, and procyanidin B3 (66), and B4 showed \u2423-glucosidase inhibitory activities with IC 50 of 24. 3, 190.7, 189.0, 111.0, and 89.0 M, respectively. Zhang et al. (2016) indicated that quercetin is also an active agent in T. sinensis could reduce the risk of diabetes and its secondary complications via reducing oxidative stress in the liver.\n\nBy using a series in vitro experiment, previous researches indicated that TSL and gallic acid are potential natural antioxidant agents Hseu et al., 2008; Cheng et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2012) . In addition, Hsieh et al. (2004) reported the antioxidant effects of methyl gallate isolated from T. sinensis against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress and DNA damage in MDCK cells. In addition, the antioxidant effects of phenolic compounds in T. sinensis have been widely proved by using DPPH scavenging assays Xing and Chen, 2010) . In 2011, Yang et al. (2011) indicated that TSL could protect endothelial cells from oxidative stress which is beneficial for treating atherosclerosis. Later in 2013, another study reported the anaerobic fermented leaves extract of T. sinensis (FETSL) could up-regulate the expression of antioxidant enzymes in SD rats .\n\nTo date, natural derived anti-inflammatory agents play important and indispensable roles in preventing and treating inflammatory diseases (Wang et al., 2013) . In addition, many natural products (including extracts and monomers) isolated form the T. sinensis have been reported to possess notable anti-inflammatory effects. Ruan et al. (2010) reported that TSL could inhibit the carrageenin-induced paw edema in rats via suppressing inflammatory mediators. Later in 2012, a report demonstrated that total polyphenols from the seeds of T. sinensis (TPST) had therapeutic effects on adjuvant-induced arthritis rats (Yang and Chen, 2012) . Furthermore, using NF-B transgenic mice and bioluminescence imaging, another two investigations revealed that TSL and gallic acid could inhibit LPS-induced inflammation via suppressing NF-B pathway in vivo and in vitro (Hsiang et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2014) . Recently, Chen et al. (2017) reported that the 7deacetylgedunin (13) isolated form the T. sinensis suppresses LPS induced inflammatory responses in RAW264.7 cells through activating Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.\n\nIschemia-reperfusion injury is one of the leading reasons for the death in the rescue and treatment of ischemic disease, in particularly the myocardial and brain tissues. In 2011, the protective effect of total polyphenols extracted from T. sinensis (TPST) on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats were reported, and the possible mechanism might be correlated to decreasing creatine kinase (CK), cardiac troponin (cTn) I, malonaldehyde (MDA), thromboxane (TXB 2 ), whereas increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) and 6-keto-PGF1 (Li and Chen, 2011a,b) . Later in 2012, another paper by Li and Chen reported that the protective effect of TPST on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury is also related to alleviating inflammatory reactions via decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u2423 & IL-6 and suppressing NF-B pathway (Li and Chen, 2012) . Besides, Yuan et al. (2013) revealed that nbutanol extract of the seeds of T. sinensis (BUST) had protective effects on multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) caused by brain ischemia-reperfusion in rats via suppressing oxidative stress.\n\nNowadays, increasing evidences have demonstrated that herbal medicines are good resources for finding hepatoprotective drugs. Interestingly, Fan et al. (2007) found that TSL could alleviate thioacetamide induced liver fibrosis via reducing TGF\u2424R1 and collagen. In addition, another investigation in 2012 reported that TSL could ameliorate the antioxidant enzymes activity in H 2 O 2 induced oxidative rats liver which would be beneficial for the hepatic detoxification (Yu et al., 2012) . Recently, Truong et al. (2016) reported that the quercitrin extracted from the T. sinensis attenuated acetaminophen-induced acute liver toxicity in HepG2 Cells and mice, and the related mechanisms is correlated to activating defensive genes and inhibiting pro-inflammatory mediators via suppressing JNK and p38 pathway.\n\nCurrently, the antiviral and antibacterial effects of T. sinensis have aroused researchers' attention. found that TSL had antiviral activity against SARS-CoV in vitro with an IC 50 value of 30 g/ml. Later in 2013, another report revealed that TSL could be used an alternative treatment and prophylaxis against H1N1 virus . Besides, it is reported that TSL also possessed promising antibacterial potential against E. coli C83902, E. coli K88, Salmonella C500, and Staphylococcus CAU0183, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were 0.25, 0.125, 0.25 and 0.25 g/ml .\n\nGout is a common painful diseases caused by accumulation of uric acid crystals in joints which is closely related to chronic purine metabolic disorder. In 2011, Liang et al. (2011) reported that TSL possessed significant inhibitory activities in vitro against xanthine oxidase (XO, IC 50 was 151.6 g/ml), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 (IC 50 was 2.26 g/ml). In addition, Wang et al. (2011) reported the total flavonoids of T. sinensis leaf (FTSL) had notable hypouricemic effects on hyperuricemic mice in vivo. These results above indicate that T. sinensis possesses significant inhibitory effect on the progression of gout.\n\nIn 2005, results of Poon et al. (2005) suggested that TSL could increase the motility of sperms via suppressing steroidogenesis, cAMP-PKA pathway and steroidogenic enzymes activities in normal mouse leydig cells. Furthermore, another paper also reported TSL could improves the functions of sperm and testes via downregulation of glutathione transferase mu6, heat shock protein 90 kDa-\u2424, cofilin 2 and cyclophilin A, whereas up-regulation of crease3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase 2, heat shock glycoprotein 96, and pancreatic trypsin 1 (Yu et al., 2012b) . These findings suggest T. sinensis is a valuable agent for men to ameliorate functions of sperm and testes under oxidative stress.\n\nUsing the topical FeCl 3 induced carotid artery thrombosis rats model, Liu and Chen (2009) reported that n-butanol extract of the seeds of T. sinensis (BUST) could obviously enhance the fibrinolysis of carotid artery thrombosis rats, and the main mechanism is involved in increasing tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen (PL G) and D-dimer (DD). Later in 2011, Jin and Chen (2011) reported that BUST had anticoagulation effect of on adrenaline induced hypercoagulable rats, which is might be correlated to prolonging the re-calcification time (RT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT) and prothrombin time (PT), and increasing the activity of anti-thrombin III (AT-III).\n\nBesides these pharmacological activities, it is also reported that TSL possesses lipolytic effect in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes via protein kinase C pathway , and Liu et al. (2014) reported that TSL could inhibit lipid accumulation through upregulating genes related to lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation in adipocytes. Furthermore, it is reported that TSL could suppress BV-2 microglia mediated neuroinflammation (Wang et al., 2014) , and have anti-nociceptive effect on acetic acid induced writhing in mice (Su et al., 2015) . Besides, 1-O-methyl-2,3,4,6-tetra-O-galloyl-\u2424-dglucopyanose isolated from the T. sinensis had anti-complementary activity on complement-injured SH-SY5Y cells , and FTSL could improve the capacities of stress resistance and delaying senescence for Caenorhabditis elegans .\n\nT. sinensis is a plant could be used both as drug and food in China for thousands years. Generally, T. sinensis was commonly considered to be as a safe herbal drug, in particular the tender shoots of T. sinensis is delicious and nutritious food stuff. However, in some ancient books of TCM, such as the Tang materia medica, the bark of this plant is reported to be an herbal medicine with mild toxicity (Anonymous, 1999) .\n\nCurrently, the systematic toxicity and safety evaluations of T. sinensis were still lacking, and only few reports had been documented. In 2007, Liao et al. (2007) evaluated the safety of the water extracts of T. sinensis leaf (TSL) using Ames test, and no obvious mutagenicity was found for all testing strains of Salmonella typhimurium TA98, TA100, TA102 and TA1535. In addition, Liao et al. (2007) also evaluated the acute oral toxicity of TSL (5000 mg/kg/day, for 14 days) and sub-acute oral toxicity of TSL (1000 mg/kg/day, for 28 days) in mice. The results indicated that TSL (5000 mg/kg/day, for 14 days) might decrease the food intake and kidney relative weight of female mice in acute oral toxicity test, and TSL (5000 mg/kg/day, for 28 days) could decrease the body weight gain, food intake and lung relative weight in sub-acute toxicity test. In another research, Liao et al. (2009) reported that no significant mutagenicity of water extract of fermented T. sinensis leaves (FTSL) was found in Ames test with the strains of S. typhimurium TA98, TA100, TA102 and TA1535; also, no obvious orally acute or subacute toxicity of FTSL (1000 mg/kg) was observed in mice. Moreover, the safety of a health care tea made by T. sinensis leaves was also evaluated on acute toxicity test in mice, ames test in S. typhimurium, micronucleus test of bone marrow PCE cell in mice, sperm shape abnormality test in mice, and the results revealed that no acute toxicity, genetic toxicity was observed (Cheng et al., 2007) .\n\nThe present review provides a full-scale profile of the traditional usage, phytochemistry, pharmacology and toxicology of T. sinensis. In the present review, 109 compounds from different parts of this plant were summarized, and these compounds mainly concluded terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, and flavonoids, etc. Additionally, the existing pharmacological investigations have revealed that agents or extracts from this plant have a wide spectrum of pharmacological effects which is beneficial for the health of human being, in particular for its anti-tumor and hypoglycemic activities. Emerging evidences from animal experiments and in vitro studies have demonstrated some traditional uses of T. sinensis; however, new drug development for this plant is still require lots of detailed studies in both the preclinical and clinical works.\n\nFirstly, currently there are few systemically ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) and toxicities data of the compounds/extracts derived from T. sinensis, which is an important reason for the delay of new drug development of this plant. Thus, more works should be done on the toxicities and pharmacokinetic profile of T. sinensis. Secondly, previous researches have reported various pharmacological effects of T. sinensis, however most of the researches only focused on the crude extract and gallic acid in this plant. Gallic acid have obvious biological activities, however, it's not a characteristic compound of T. sinensis. Due to this plant contains abundant terpenoids, extensive researches are required to investigate the pharmacological properties of monomers belonging to terpenoids in this plant. Third, as a traditional delicious food and nutritious food stuff, previous researches have revealed that this plant possesses good anti-tumor, hypoglycemic and antioxidant effects, the tender shoots and leaves of T. sinensis also have the huge potential for functional food development. Fourth, the T. sinensis was traditional used to treat dysentery, enteritis, carminative, itchiness, and eye infections in Chinese folk medicine. However, not all of these traditional uses above were demonstrated by current pharmacological experiments; thus, more possible medicinal potentials of this plant might be investigated in the future. Lastly, there is no clinic trial of this plant, thus more works should be devoted to do some systemic clinic trials for T. sinensis in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, this paper systemic reviewed the traditional usage, phytochemistry, pharmacology and toxicology of T. sinensis, which might highlight the importance of this plant and provides some directions for the future development of T. sinensis.\n\nQWH and CJW contributed in conceiving this review; WP, YJL, MBH and MMZ contributed in collecting and analysis the references and data; JY and FL contributed in editing the manuscript; WP and YJL contributed in writing the manuscript.\n\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest."}
