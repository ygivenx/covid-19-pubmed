{"title": "", "body": "\u2022 Hemoplasmosis*** (p 530)\n\nIn most parts of the world, the most common causes of hemolytic anemia are infectious, especially from Mycoplasma haemofelis, and Candidatus M. haemominutum infection. Typically cats present with pale mucous membranes, anorexia, mild to marked depression and sometimes fever.\n\nTypically cats present with pale mucous membranes, anorexia, depression and fever. Dyspnea, collapse and death occur commonly.\n\n\u2022 Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia** (p 532) Primary immune-mediated hemolytic anemia in cats is unusual when compared to dogs but secondary immune-mediated red cell destruction can occur secondary to drugs, vaccines and infectious agents. Anemia is usually regenerative but may be non-regenerative. Depression, and variable fever, splenomegaly and icterus occur. Agglutination or a positive Coomb's test are indicative of an immune-mediated process.\n\n\u2022 Drugs and toxins** (p 533) Some drugs like acetaminophen and benzocaines and other toxins result in Heinz body anemia in cats which is usually regenerative. Other drugs and toxins induce non-regenerative anemia (see below). Lethargy, anorexia, weakness, pale mucous membranes and elevated heart and respiratory rates are often present.\n\n\u2022 Local diseases of blood vessels** (p 536) Blood loss anemia can occur when blood vessels are damaged by trauma, erosive diseases like tumors or fungal infections, and vasculitis-like systemic lupus erythrematosus. Signs include anemia, and evidence of internal or external bleeding such as melena, hematochezia, hematuria, dyspnea, hemothorax or hemoabdomen.\n\n\u2022 Platelet abnormalities (primary hemostatic defects)** (p 537) Diseases of platelets including those resulting in thrombocytopenia or those resulting in decreased platelet function. Anemia together with petechiae and ecchymoses at more than one site are typical signs. Hemorrhage may involve the fundus of the eye, mucous membranes of the mouth, vulva, and penis, and skin including ears.\n\n\u2022 Factor abnormalities (secondary hemostatic defects)** (p 538)\n\nDecreased amounts or function of coagulation factors. Typically there is anemia together with evidence of hemorrhage at more than one site involving fundus of the eye, mucous membranes of the mouth, vulva, and penis, and skin including ears. Dyspnea, coughing, hemothorax or hemoabdomen may also be evident.\n\nSystemic arterial hypertension rarely results in significant blood loss and anemia, except if epistaxis is involved. Retinal hemorrhage and epistaxis are most common sites of visible hemorrhage.\n\n\u2022 Renal failure** (p 540) Anemia occurs in many cats with chronic renal failure, but presenting complaints are usually those of renal disease not anemia. Polyuria, polydipsia, inappetance and weight loss are typical.\n\nWhile rare in cats, hypoadrenocorticism does occur and results in anemia. Depression, lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia and weakness occur.\n\nRarely, anemia may result from hypothyroidism following treatment of hyperthyroidism. Lethargy, weight gain, seborrhea and delayed hair regrowth are typical.\n\nWhile rare in cats, chronic blood loss can result in microcytic anemia. Lethargy, anorexia, weight loss and signs of chronic gastrointestinal disease resulting in chronic blood loss may be present. Severe flea infestation in young kittens may result in anemia.\n\n\u2022 Folic acid antagonism/deficiency Chronic administration of pyrimethamine or sulfa drugs can result in macrocytic anemia. Dietary insufficiency (tuna diet), malabsorption, and congenital defects may also cause folic acid deficiency. continued \u2022 Anemia of chronic disease*** (p 539) Diseases associated with chronic inflammation, usually infectious or neoplastic, can result in anemia of chronic disease. Chronic anorexia, lethargy and weight loss, with or without fever, are typically present.\n\nNeoplasms of the bone marrow can crowd out red blood cell precursors. Lethargy, anorexia, weight loss and pale mucous membranes are often present.\n\nLethargy, anorexia and weight loss are typical. Anemia may be a main presenting sign. Signs may be referable to secondary infections or neoplasia.\n\nOther classic viral diseases associated with non-regenerative anemia in cats include feline infectious peritonitis and feline immunodeficiency virus. Lethargy, anorexia, weight loss and fever are typical. Signs are referable to secondary infections (FIV) or effusion into body cavities and pyogranulomatous inflammation of the liver, kidney, eye or CNS (FIP).\n\nUncommon diseases in cats compared to dogs. Lethargy, anorexia, depression and fever are the most common signs. Other signs reported include hyperesthesia, lameness or joint pain, pale mucous membranes, splenomegaly, dyspnea, diarrhea and uveitis.\n\n\u2022 Immune-mediated (pure red cell aplasia)\n\nImmune-mediated reactions can be directed at precusor cells resulting in non-regenerative anemia. Lethargy, anorexia, weight loss and pale mucous membranes are often present. Heart and respiratory rates may be elevated once anemia is severe.\n\nAnemia is defined as a packed cell volume of less than 27%.\n\nAnemia is either regenerative or non-regenerative.\n\n\u2022 Regenerative anemia is characterized by reticulocyte counts greater than 60 000/\u03bcl; non-regenerative anemia has less than 60 000/\u03bcl. \u2022 By definition, it takes from 3-5 days after acute development of anemia to have maximal reticulocytosis, and so acute anemia may initially appear as non-regenerative.\n\n\u2022 If the anemia has been present for 3-5 days and the reticulocyte count is < 60 000 the anemia is nonregenerative.\n\nThe two primary differential diagnoses for regenerative anemia are hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells) and blood loss.\n\nLoss can occur out of the body through wounds, the gastrointestinal tract, or the nose. Bleeding into body cavities and parenchymal organs also occurs.\n\n\u2022 If the blood loss is out of the body, total protein concentrations are usually decreased, whereas blood loss into a body cavity and hemolytic anemias usually has normal total protein concentrations.\n\nBlood loss can result from local diseases of vessels like trauma or erosion of the vessel due to diseases like neoplasia. Vasculitis, hypertension, factor abnormalities and platelet abnormalities also can result in blood loss anemia.\n\nThere are multiple mechanisms for hemolytic anemia including infectious diseases, primary immune-mediated diseases, microangiopathic diseases, toxins, congenital diseases and metabolic diseases.\n\nNon-regenerative anemias generally imply bone marrow dysfunction, which can be caused by many things including infectious diseases, toxicities, neoplasia, chronic inflammation and metabolic diseases.\n\nHemolytic anemia is intravascular or extravascular, but is usually extravascular (liver, spleen) in cats.\n\nBlood loss in regenerative anemia can be into body spaces (abdomen, thorax) or out of the body (usually GIT) as a result of local vascular damage, or systemic coagulation or platelet problems.\n\nNon-regenerative anemia indicates a bone marrow problem.\n\nHemotropic mycoplasmas (previously hemobartonellosis) are the most common causes of regenerative anemia. Less common causes are immune-mediated, drug-or toxin-associated, vascular damage from trauma, tumors or fungal infection, coagulopathies and thrombocytopenia. \n\nThe organisms are epicellular parasites of red blood cells (RBC).\n\nM. haemofelis (previously known as the large form) is most pathogenic.\n\nAnemia is from immune-mediated reactions that are organism specific or directed at RBC membrane proteins that have been modified by the parasitism.\n\nAntibody-coated red blood cells are removed by the reticuloendothelial system, and intravascular lysis is unusual; Coomb's positive test results are common.\n\nLevel of parasitemia fluctuates rapidly making diagnosis difficult based on cytology.\n\nThe acute phase of disease usually develops within 3 weeks; spontaneous recovery followed by recurrence from the chronic carrier state can occur.\n\nAnemia associated with Candidatus Mycoplasma haemomintum is often detected in cats with current feline leukemia virus infection.\n\nIn locations where feline leukemia virus is common, approximately 50% of infected cats are co-infected with the virus; co-infection with feline immunodeficiency virus is rare.\n\nInfection is most common in male cats less than 3 years of age, and occurs most often in the spring.\n\nCats are usually presented for depression, lethargy and anorexia.\n\nPale mucous membranes are a common physical examination abnormality. Fever and icterus are also common.\n\nSplenomegaly occurs in some from extramedullary hematopoiesis and immune stimulation.\n\nFleas or flea dirt may or may not be noted.\n\nChronic infection may lead to recurrent hemolytic anemia or intermittent fever, depression and anorexia without hemolytic anemia.\n\nDiagnosis is based on cytological demonstration of the organism on the surface of RBC. However, the organism may be difficult to find even though clinical signs are present, and at least 50% of cats are falsely negative on cytological examination.\n\nThe organism may dislodge from the surface of RBCs placed in EDTA in cytologically negative suspect cats.\n\nIn suspect cats, repeat cytological assessment using smears made from blood without anti-coagulants.\n\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) is available commercially. PCR is positive in some cytologically nega-tive cats suggesting it is more sensitive. Some healthy cats are PCR positive and so the predictive value for presence of disease is not 100%.\n\nMacroscopic or microscopic agglutination, spherocytosis, or Coomb's positive test results are suggestive.\n\nAny infectious, immune-mediated, or neoplastic cause of hemolytic anemia can look similar as a result of signs associated with fever and anemia. Demonstration of the organism by cytological assessment or PCR differentiates mycoplasma-associated hemolytic anemia from other causes.\n\nDoxycycline at 10 mg/kg, PO, q 24 hours for the first week and then continued q 24 hours for 2 weeks. If the cat will tolerate treatment, a total of 4 weeks of treatment may result in more cats becoming PCR negative.\n\nWhile tetracycline at 22 mg/kg, PO q 8 hours can be effective it is no longer recommended since doxycycline is superior.\n\nEnrofloxacin at 5-10 mg/kg, PO, q 12-24 hours for 2-3 weeks may be effective in cats that are intolerant of tetracyclines. Doses over 5.5 mg/kg may be associated with retinal toxicity and blindness in a small percentage of cats.\n\nFor cats that do not tolerate or are resistant to tetracyclines and enrofloxacin, imidocarb diproprionate at 5 mg/kg, IM or SQ, q 2 weeks, for 2-4 injections can be used.\n\nChloramphenicol at 15 mg/kg, PO, q 12 hours for 3 weeks has been used but not studied experimentally; this drug also has been associated with bone marrow suppression.\n\nPrednisolone at 1-2 mg/kg, PO, q 12 hours should be used for at least the first week of therapy because of the immune-mediated pathogenesis.\n\nTreatment lessens clinical signs of disease but does not resolve infection in many cats.\n\nWhile there is no PCV that alone indicates when to transfuse, whole blood transfusions are generally indicated if the PCV is dropping rapidly and heart and respiration rates are elevated at rest.\n\nBlood typing should be performed if possible in breeds prone to the B type (British short hair, Devon Rex, Cornish Rex, Japanese bobtail, Scottish fold, Sphinx, Somoli).\n\nCross-match results may be hard to interpret due to spontaneous agglutination.\n\nSince M. haemofelis is the most common cause of hemolytic anemia in cats, treatment should be considered for all suspect cats, even if the organism cannot be found.\n\nMost treated cats survive. The prognosis is worse for those with concurrent immunodeficiency-inducing diseases.\n\nBecause treated cats are usually not cured, exacerbations are common.\n\nFlea control and housing cats indoors lessen potential for exposure.\n\nCats used as blood donors should be tested for both Mycoplasma haemofelis and Candidatus Mycoplasma haemomintum using PCR techniques. Donor cats exposed to fleas should be regularly retested.\n\n\u2022 Lethargy, anorexia, depression, +/fever.\n\n\u2022 Pale mucous membranes.\n\n\u2022 +/splenomegaly or icterus.\n\nPrimary immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) is rare and the cause unknown.\n\nSecondary IMHA occurs from hypersensitivity reactions against drugs (like beta-lactam antibiotics), modified-live vaccines, neoplasms, and infectious agents like M. haemofelis and feline leukemia virus.\n\nRBC can be lysed in the bloodstream (intravascular) or removed by the reticuloendothelial system (extravascular), with the latter being most common.\n\nLarge concentrations of anti-RBC antibodies result in cross-linking and macroscopic or microscopic agglutination.\n\nSpherocytes are formed when fixed reticuloendothelial cells remove part of the antibody or complementcoated RBC membrane.\n\nThe immune reaction can be directed at RBC precursors resulting in non-regenerative anemia.\n\nDepression, lethargy and anorexia are common presenting complaints.\n\nHistory of recent vaccination (within 1 month) or antibiotic administration may be present.\n\nHistory of fleas is common in cats with hemotropic mycoplasmosis.\n\nFading kitten syndrome occurs in kittens with a history of a type B queen mated to a type A tom (neonatal isoerythrolysis; see page 1134).\n\nPale mucous membranes, tachycardia and tachypnea are common.\n\nSplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy occur in some cats.\n\nIcterus is dependent on rapidity of anemia development. White blood cells are activated commonly resulting in fever.\n\nPresence of spherocytes is classic but difficult to document in cats compared to dogs since normal RBC of cats is relatively small, and they do not have central pallor.\n\nMacroscopic or microscopic agglutination. If agglutinating cells are noted, mix 1 drop of blood in EDTA with 1 drop 0.9% NaCl and repeat the thin blood smear. If cells are no longer clumped, massive roulette formation was occurring and not agglutination.\n\nDirect Coomb's testing can be used in cases without spherocytes or autoagglutination to confirm presence of IgG, IgM or complement on the surface of RBC. EDTA blood is submitted to the laboratory for reaction with Coomb's reagent (anti-IgG, anti-IgM, anti-complement) . Optimally, the laboratory should provide a titer, not the result of a single dilution. Feline-specific Coomb's reagent must be used.\n\nAntinuclear antibody testing can be performed. Some cats with systemic lupus erythematosus will be positive and have primary immune-mediated hemolytic anemia.\n\nErythrophagocytosis can be noted on bone marrow examination; maturation arrest of RBC development may be detected if immune response is directed at precursor cells.\n\nAny infectious or neoplastic cause of hemolytic or blood loss anemia can look similar because the signs of fever and anemia are not specific, and immune destruction of RBC may be partly involved in the pathogenesis of the anemia. Diagnosis is often based on exclusion of infectious and neoplastic causes, and demonstration of agglutination or a positive Coomb's test.\n\nDexamethasone at 1 mg/kg, IV, once on day 1.\n\nPrednisolone at 2-4 mg/kg, PO, q 12 hours initially followed by decreasing doses every other week provided anemia is resolving. If maintenance treatment is required, the target dose is approximately 0.5 mg/kg, PO, q 48 h.\n\nDoxycycline at 5-10 mg/kg, PO, q 12 hours for at least 14 days in all cats with hemolytic anemia due to possible hemobartonellosis.\n\nDexamethasone administered at 0.1-0.2 mg/kg, PO, q 12 hours in cats resistant to prednisolone.\n\nCyclosporine at 1-5 mg/kg, PO, q 12-24 hours, for 7-14 days is indicated for acute treatment of cats that are autoagglutinating or undergoing intravascular hemolysis.\n\nCyclophosphamide at 6.25-12 mg/cat, PO, 4 days weekly for 1-2 weeks has been used in some cats acutely but is not currently used by the author.\n\nChlorambucil at 0.2 mg/kg, PO, q 24 hours may be needed in some cats with glucocorticoid-induced side effects or incomplete control, and should be used in place of cyclophosphamide for long-term management.\n\nAzathiaprine at 0.3 mg/kg, PO, q 72 hours may be needed in some cats with glucocorticoid-induced side effects or incomplete control, but extreme bone marrow suppression can occur and chlorambucil is preferred.\n\nWhole blood transfusion may be indicated if the PCV is dropping rapidly, the cat is depressed, and if heart and respiration rates are elevated at rest.\n\nPrognosis with primary IMHA is unknown since it is rare.\n\nTheoretically, secondary IMHA should have a good prognosis since the initiating antigen (M. haemofelis, vaccines, antibiotics) can be removed.\n\nAvoid over-stimulating cat immune systems with antibiotics and vaccines.\n\nCats with primary or secondary IMHA should be housed indoors and no longer vaccinated.\n\nLessen exposure to fleas to potentially avoid infection by M. haemofelis.\n\n\u2022 Lethargy, anorexia, depression.\n\n\u2022 Pale mucous membranes and elevated heart and respiratory rate. \u2022 History of exposure to oxidative toxin.\n\nOxidation of the globin in hemoglobin leads to formation of Heinz bodies (precipitated hemoglobin).\n\nAnemia results from cell lysis or framentation in capillaries because of fragility, or removal by the fixed reticuloendothelial system of the spleen and liver.\n\nLethargy, anorexia, weakness, pale mucous membranes and elevated heart and respiratory rates occur.\n\nHistory of exposure to oxidative toxins like acetaminophen (iatrogenic), onions (foodstuffs like babyfood), zinc (United States pennies, airline carrier hardware), propothiouracil (iatrogenic), methylene blue (iatrogenic), phenazopyridine (iatrogenic), vitamin K1 (iatrogenic), propylene glycol (food stuffs; carrier in some medications), and benzocaine derivatives (iatrogenic).\n\nHeinz bodies (intracytoplasmic irregular retractile granules) are seen cytologically on thin blood smears.\n\nMethemoglobin levels can be elevated; blood has a brown color.\n\nRemove the source of the oxidant injury.\n\nN-acetylcysteine at 140 mg/kg, PO, once followed by 70 mg/kg, PO every 4-6 hours if severe methemoglobinemia is present.\n\nSupportive care including whole blood transfusion if needed.\n\n\u2022 Anemia, muscle weakness in diabetic cat. \u2022 Ataxia, seizures.\n\nExtreme hypophosphatemia may occur during initial treatment of ketoacidotic diabetes mellitus, and result in muscle weakness, ataxia, seizures and pale mucous membranes.\n\nLiver disease may result in red blood cell fragility.\n\nMeasurement of serum phosphorus concentrations.\n\nAdminister potassium phosphates at 0.03-0.12 mmol/kg/h until normophosphatemic.\n\nAlternately, prevent hypophosphatemia (and hypokalemia) by giving calculated potassium requirements as 30% potassium chloride and 50% potassium dihydrophosphate.\n\nPhosphate concentrations are usually maintained within normal concentrations by diet alone after resolution of the ketoacidotic crisis.\n\n\u2022 Lethargy, anorexia, depression. \u2022 Clinical signs of the primary disease.\n\nDiseases that involve small vessels like disseminated intravascular coagulation (fibrin strands), dirofilariasis, and splenic tumors or hematomas damage RBC resulting in formation of schistocytes or fragments.\n\nHistory, physical examination, and laboratory assessment support the primary disease.\n\nLethargy, depression, weakness and pale mucous membranes may result if anemia is severe.\n\nSchistocytes are seen cytologically on thin blood smears.\n\nDiagnostic work-up for the suspected primary cause should be performed.\n\n\u2022 Fever, depression, shock and death. \u2022 Indoor/outdoor cats in the Gulf Coast states. \u2022 History of tick exposure.\n\nBobcats are subclinically infected by Cytauxzoon felis and so are probably the natural host.\n\nTransmission occurs from infected bobcats to domestic cats by Dermacentor variabilis.\n\nTransmission of the organism results in clinical illness in 5-20 days.\n\nSchizonts and macroschizonts form in mononuclear phagocytes, line the lumen of veins, and obstruct blood flow through tissues (tissue phase).\n\nMerozoites released from infected macrophages infect erythrocytes causing hemolytic anemia (erythrocyte phase).\n\nMost infected cats are presented for depression.\n\nPhysical examination usually reveals fever, anorexia, dyspnea, depression, collapse, icterus, and pale mucous membranes.\n\nHypothermia develops in some cats preceeding death.\n\nDeath is a common sequel, but strains of C. felis that spontaneously resolve have now been recognized.\n\nMost cases of cytauxzoonosis are in outdoor cats, but ticks are generally not identified\n\nThe course of disease is generally 1 week or less in cats infected with pathogenic strains.\n\nCats infected with non-pathogenic strains may live for years.\n\nRegenerative anemia, neutrophilic leukocytosis or leukopenia, thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis, hemoglobinemia, hemoglobinuria, bilirubinemia and bilirubinuria are the most common laboratory abnormalities, but vary between patients.\n\nAntemortem diagnosis is based on demonstrating the ring-shaped erythrocytic phase on thin blood smears which occurs in most cats with acute illness.\n\nThe organism can be detected in infected macrophages in bone marrow, spleen, liver, or lymph node aspirates stained with Wright's or Giemsa stains.\n\nSerologic testing can be used to confirm exposure, but is usually not needed clinically PCR assay has been studied experimentally and may be available in the future.\n\nAny infectious, immune-mediated, or neoplastic cause of hemolytic anemia can look similar due to the signs associated with fever and anemia. Identification of the organism is diagnostic.\n\nFluid therapy and blood transfusion should be administered as indicated (see hemobartonellosis).\n\nImidocarb administered at 5.0 mg/kg, IM, every 14 days for two doses or diminazene at 2.0 mg/kg, IM, every 7 days for two doses are the drugs of choice but no treatment is known to be effective.\n\nParvaquone, buparvaquone, thiacetarsamide and tetracycline therapy have also been attempted.\n\nCytauxzoon felis is not known to infect people.\n\nTick control should be maintained, and cats in endemic areas should be housed indoors.\n\nClassical signs \u2022 Lethargy, anorexia, weight loss. \u2022 Pale mucous membranes. \u2022 Young Abyssinian, Somalis, Siamese or DSH cat.\n\nCongenital diseases resulting in hemolysis are rare in cats.\n\nPyruvate kinase deficiency has been described in Abyssinian cats, Somalis and DSH with intermittent, regenerative anemias.\n\nIncreased osmotic fragility of erythrocytes causing hemolytic crises with macrocytic regenerative anemia and splenomegaly has also been documented in Abyssinians and Somalis.\n\nCats with hereditary hemolytic anemias exhibit intermittent anemia and weight loss, and the clinical signs appear to be ameliorated by splenectomy.\n\nPorphyria in a family of Siamese cats was associated with severe macrocytic, hypochromic anemia with poikilocytosis, Howell-Jolly bodies, and nucleated red blood cells.\n\nPorphyrins produce a brownish discoloration of teeth, bones (at necropsy), and urine, all of which fluoresce bright pink-red with ultraviolet light.\n\nMeasure pyruvate kinase activities.\n\nMeasure blood porphyria concentrations. Demonstrate fluorescence of porphyrins in teeth or urine. \n\nWeakness and lethargy are common presenting complaints.\n\nBlood usually is lost into tissues, spaces like the pleural space and peritoneal cavity, the gastrointestinal tract (including palate of the cat), or any external damaged tissue like the nose.\n\nBleeding may or may not be evident, depending on where the blood is lost.\n\nMelena or hematochezia may be present in cases with gastrointestinal blood loss; exceptions include small volume, chronic bleeding and acute loss.\n\nAcute dyspnea or weakness associated with pale mucous membranes and evidence of hemothorax or hemoabdomen on centesis are typical findings.\n\nIn contrast to blood loss from coagulopathies or hypertension, local diseases usually do not result in evidence of bleeding at distant sites. The exception is vasculitis.\n\nFungal and neoplastic diseases of the nose that result in epistaxis usually have mucopurulent discharge prior to development of epistaxis.\n\nOther clinical signs are associated with the primary disease.\n\nDiagnostic work-up and findings are dependent on the individual primary disease and site of bleeding.\n\nClassical signs \u2022 Anemia.\n\n\u2022 Petechiae and ecchymoses at more than one site. \u2022 Hemorrhage involving fundus of the eye, mucous membranes of the mouth, vulva, and penis, and skin including ears.\n\nPlatelet diseases can be divided into those inducing thrombocytopenia and those inducing platelet dysfunction.\n\nThe differential categories for thrombocytopenia include consumption, destruction, decreased production and sequestration.\n\nThe most common causes of platelet consumption are disseminated intravascular coagulation and consumption at sites of inflammation.\n\nThe most common cause of platelet destruction is immune-mediated which can be either primary or secondary to drugs and vaccines.\n\nPlatelets are produced by the bone marrow and so any bone marrow disease can potentially result in thrombocytopenia. Neoplasia and feline leukemia virus are common examples.\n\nSequestration of platelets usually occurs in the spleen or liver but is not a primary disease.\n\nPlatelet function abnormalities can be iatrogenic (aspirin), congential (rare in cats), or acquired (hyperglobulinemia).\n\nDiseases of platelets usually result in petechiae and ecchymoses.\n\nIngestion of aspirin may be known.\n\nClinical signs are usually consistent with where the primary bleeding is occurring and the primary disease resulting in hemorrhage.\n\nMost bleeding disorders will have evidence of hemorrhage in more than one site. The fundus of the eye, mucous membranes of the mouth, vulva, and penis, and the skin especially ear and ventral abdomen are good places to evaluate for evidence of hemorrhage.\n\nPlatelet count should be made; spontaneous hemorrhage generally occurs with platelet counts of < 50 000 platelets/\u03bcl.\n\nPlatelet estimates can be made; under oil immersion (1000\u00d7), every one platelet per field equates to approximately 20 000 platelets/\u03bcl.\n\nWhen thrombocytopenia is suspected, scan the blood smear evaluating for clumps which may falsely lower the count.\n\nIf giant platelets are present, decreased production of platelets is unlikely.\n\nIf persistent thrombocytopenia is present, a bone marrow examination is indicated to evaluate for myelophthitic disease and latent feline leukemia virus infection (IFA or PCR; see FeLV section).\n\nPlatelet function deficits in cats are rare, however von Willebrand's disease does occur.\n\nBleeding time assesses platelet function and should be less than 5 minutes.\n\nBleeding time should only be performed in cats with normal platelet counts and factor tests (ACT, etc.).\n\nTreatment varies with the primary disease (see appropriate section) but frequently includes administration of fresh whole blood transfusion if life-threatening hemorrhage is occurring.\n\nFresh plasma can be used if red blood cells are not needed.\n\nFor suspected secondary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, remove the potential source if possible (antibiotic or vaccine).\n\nPrimary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia is rare in cats, but treatment is as discussed for hemolytic anemia (see appropriate section).\n\nClassical signs \u2022 Anemia.\n\n\u2022 Evidence of hemorrhage at more than one site involving fundus of the eye, mucous membranes of the mouth, vulva, and penis, and skin including ears. \u2022 Dyspnea, coughing, hemothorax or hemoabdomen.\n\nFactor abnormalities can be divided into decreased amounts (liver disease, DIC, hemophilia, cholestasis, warfarin toxicity) or decreased function of coagulation factors (circulating anti-coagulants like heparin).\n\nHepatic insufficiency leads to decreased production of procoagulants.\n\nHepatic cholestasis results in absence of vitamin K and failure to convert factors II, VII, IX and X to active coagulants.\n\nHemophilia is the congenital lack of a factor or factors.\n\nWarfarin toxicity results in vitamin K antagonism and the resultant failure to convert factors II, VII, IX and X to active coagulants.\n\nIncreased amounts of circulating anticoagulants are most common with mast cell tumors (heparin) or DIC (fibrinogen degradation products).\n\nMost bleeding disorders will have evidence of hemorrhage in more than one site.\n\nDecreased amounts or function of coagulation factors usually results in bleeding into body cavities like the chest and peritoneal cavity.\n\nThe fundus of the eye and mucous membranes of the mouth, vulva and penis are good places to evaluate for evidence of hemorrhage.\n\nClinical signs are usually consistent with where the primary bleeding is occurring and the primary disease resulting in hemorrhage.\n\nIngestion of vitamin K antagonistic rodenticides may be known.\n\nCats with hepatic insufficiency usually have other clinical signs like weight loss, anorexia, polyuria/polydipsia.\n\nCats with cholestasis commonly have other clinical findings like weight loss, anorexia and icterus.\n\nDIC is a syndrome induced by other diseases; clinical findings are consistent with the primary disease.\n\nIf severe enough to cause spontaneous hemorrhage, hemophilia usually presents in younger cats.\n\nActivated clotting time (ACT; normal < 65 seconds) can be used in clinical settings to assess the intrinsic and common coagulation pathways. Factor VII is the only factor deficiency not screened by the activated clotting time (extrinsic pathway), but factor VII hemophilia is rare and so the ACT is an excellent clinical screening test for factor deficiencies. Thrombocytopenia < 50 000 platelets/\u03bcl can prolong the ACT by up to 10-15 seconds due to lack of platelet phospholipid.\n\nThe activated partial thromoplastin time and prothrombin time as well as specific assessment of different factors or proteins induced by vitamin K absence or antagonism are performed on citrated plasma; samples should be collected and stored prior to starting treatment.\n\nTreatment varies with the disease, but frequently includes administration of fresh whole blood transfusion if life-threatening hemorrhage is occurring.\n\nFrozen plasma can be used to supply coagulation factors if red blood cells or platelets are not needed.\n\nIf vitamin K antagonists are the cause of the hemorrhage, vitamin K1 should be given subcutaneously at 1-5 mg/kg, q 12 hour for 24 hours. Dose is dependent on the type of anti-coagulant ingested. Warfarin can be treated with 1-3 mg/kg and long-acting products should be treated with 3-5 mg/kg. Oral administration of vitamin K1 is initiated on day 2 at 1-5 mg/kg, q 12 hours for 2 weeks (warfarin) to 6 weeks (long-acting anti-coagulant) depending on the type of anti-coagulant ingested.\n\nVitamin K1 given intravenously can result in an anaphylactoid reaction.\n\nWhen vitamin K1 therapy is discontinued, the cat should be returned in 72 hours for assessment of an ACT or prothrombin time. If increased at that time, two more weeks of therapy should be prescribed prior to the next evaluation.\n\n\u2022 Sudden onset of blindness with dilated pupils from retinal hemorrhage. \u2022 Epistaxis. \u2022 Evidence of diseases causing hypertension, especially renal disease or hyperthyroidism.\n\nSystemic arterial hypertension in cats is usually from renal disease, hyperthyroidism, hyperadrenocorticism and idiopathic (essential).\n\nSystemic arterial hypertension can result in hemorrhage; retinal hemorrhage and epistaxis are most common.\n\nWith the exception of epistaxis, volume of blood loss is usually small and so anemia is rare.\n\nSystolic blood pressure > 175 mmHg using a Doppler system is abnormal.\n\n\u2022 Some normal cats will appear hypertensive due to epinephrine release from the stress of measuring the blood pressure.\n\nRenal and endocrine causes of hypertension should be excluded by bloodwork and urinalysis.\n\nACE-inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and sodium restriction are used to manage systemic arterial hypertension in cats.\n\nSee appropriate sections for specific treatment recommendations (page 134).\n\n\u2022 Chronic lethargy, anorexia and depression.\n\nActivation of leukocytes by the primary disease results in the production of cytokines like interleukin 1.\n\nIn the face of inflammatory cytokines, macrophages fail to release iron to be used for red blood cell production.\n\nRed blood cell life span is slightly shortened.\n\nResponse of the bone marrow to erythropoietin may be blunted.\n\nDiseases associated with chronic inflammation, usually infectious or neoplastic, can result in anemia of chronic disease.\n\nClinical signs are those usually related to the primary disease with minimal clinical findings associated with the anemia.\n\nThe anemia is generally mild compared to those associated with FeLV or immune-mediated diseases.\n\nDiagnosis is usually based on exclusion of other causes of non-regenerative anemia combined with documentation of a chronic neoplastic or inflammatory disease.\n\nMild normocytic-normochromic, non-regenerative anemia (PCV is generally 18-27%).\n\nPlatelet counts are generally normal.\n\nNeutrophilia and monocytosis may be present due to chronic inflammation induced by the primary disease.\n\nBone marrow cytology shows increased iron stores in bone marrow macrophages.\n\nFeLV, myelophthtic disease, ehrlichiosis, anemia of renal failure, hypoadrenocorticism.\n\nRemove the source of the chronic disease.\n\nErythropoietin and other bone marrow stimulants are unlikely to be effective.\n\n\u2022 Weight loss, inappetence.\n\n\u2022 Polyuria, polydipsia.\n\n\u2022 \u00b1 Intermittent vomiting.\n\n\u2022 Pale mucous membranes.\n\nPolydipsia, polyuria, inappetence, weight loss, intermittent vomiting, \"rubber jaw\", small kidneys, and other findings consistent with chronic renal failure (see page 234).\n\nThe non-regenerative anemia is generally mild to moderate (PCV \u2265 18) from erythropoietin lack, unless accompanied by blood loss anemia from gastrointestinal hemorrhage or hemolysis from hypophosphatemia. Other factors contributing to anemia in renal failure include shortened red cell survival, and the effects of uremic toxins such as parathyroid hormone on erythropoiesis.\n\nDocumentation of azotemia with suboptimal urineconcentrating ability (see page 645).\n\nExclude other causes of non-regenerative anemia.\n\nMild to moderate normocytic, normochromic, nonregenerative anemia (PCV = 15-27%).\n\nNeutrophil and platelet numbers are generally normal.\n\nAny cause of non-regenerative anemia.\n\n\u2022 100 U/kg, SC, 3 days weekly for induction.\n\n\u2022 Adjust dose and frequency to maintain PCV > 20 for maintenance. \u2022 Antibodies may be generated against the human recombinant product inactivating it, which occurs in 20-30% of treated cats. \u2022 Severe immune-mediated reactions rarely occur. \u2022 Some clinicians use erythropoietin to induce remission of anemia and attempt to use anabolic steroids to maintain remission. \u2022 If iron deficiency is present, response to erythropoietin can be blunted.\n\nIf clinically indicated, administer a blood transfusion while waiting for an erythropoietin response. Indication is inappetence, and increased heart and respiratory rates at rest.\n\nAnabolic steroids (see page 1339).\n\n\u2022 Lethargy, anorexia, weight loss; usually in cats < 6 years. \u2022 +/clinical findings consistent with lymphoma; masses, etc. \u2022 +/secondary infections of any organ system.\n\nFeline leukemia virus (FeLV) is a single-stranded RNA virus that produces reverse transcriptase enzyme.\n\nThe envelope protein p15e is associated with the development of immunosuppression.\n\nThe core protein p27 is present in the cytoplasm of infected cells as well as in the peripheral blood, saliva and tears of infected cats; detection of p27 is the basis of the immunofluorescence and ELISA tests for FeLV.\n\nThe envelope glycoprotein 70 (gp70) contains subgroup antigens A, B or C; these subgroups are associated with the infectivity, virulence and disease caused by individual strains of the virus.\n\nAll cats carry subgroup A either alone or in combination with B or C.\n\nSubgroup A may cause malignancy by itself, but coinfection with B or C may have a synergistic effect on oncogenicity.\n\nExposure to gp70 results in the production of neutralizing antibodies in some cats. Following exposure, cats either become persistently infected, develop latent or sequestered infection, become immune carriers or have self-limiting infection.\n\nWhether or not infection occurs following natural exposure to FeLV is determined by the virus subtype or strain, the virus dose, the age of the cat when exposed, and the cat's immune responses.\n\nApproximately 30% of the cats with self-limiting infection will have provirus present (latent infection) which can be associated with p27-negative lymphoma and possible reactivation to persistent viremia.\n\nLatent infection can be activated by the administration of glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressive drugs or pregnancy.\n\noccurs in up to 26% of cats exposed to FeLV; the bone marrow, spleen, lymph node and small intestine are the tissues most commonly involved. It is unknown what percentage of these cats develops clinical disease but some cats will transmit the virus to offspring.\n\nIn experimental studies, 100% of neonatal kittens, 70-85% of weanling kittens, and 15-30% of cats > 4 months old were infected when exposed; adults may be more difficult to infect than kittens due to the maturation of macrophage function.\n\nSubgroup C induces aplastic anemia from tropism for macrophages resulting in increased secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha.\n\nImmunodeficiency syndromes are likely to occur secondary to T lymphocyte depletion (both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes) or dysfunction, and either neutropenia or neutrophil function deficits.\n\nThe principal route of infection is prolonged contact with infected cat saliva and nasal secretions; biting is not required but can transmit infection.\n\nFomite transmission and aerosol transmission are unlikely due to poor survival of the organism in the environment.\n\nTransplacental infection and transmission by milk occur but more kittens are probably infected when licked and groomed by the infected queen.\n\nFeLV has been detected in semen and vaginal epithelium and so venereal transmission is possible.\n\nThe role of blood-sucking arthropods in the transmission of FeLV is largely unknown but considered of minimal importance.\n\nAny age, gender or breed of cat can develop signs of FeLV infection but the majority are male and between 1-6 years of age.\n\nMost FeLV-infected cats are evaluated for non-specific signs such as anorexia, weight loss and depression or for evaluation of abnormalities associated with specific organ systems.\n\nOf FeLV-infected cats evaluated at necropsy, 23% have evidence of neoplasia (96% -lymphoma/ leukemia complex) and the remainder die from non-neoplastic diseases including those from secondary infections due to immunosuppression.\n\n\u2022 Stomatitis and halitosis may be secondary to overgrowth of normal bacterial flora or persistent calicivirus infection from immunosuppression. \u2022 Vomiting and diarrhea occur in some FeLVinfected cats and may be due to opportunistic infections such as salmonellosis, giardiasis or cryptosporidiosis or lymphoma. \u2022 A form of enteritis clinically and histopathologically resembling panleukopenia but apparently related to FeLV infection has been described, and is possibly secondary to enteric coronavirus infection.\n\nMycoplasma haemomintum (Haemobartonella felis). \u2022 Hepatic icterus is related to hepatic lymphoma, hepatic lipidosis and focal liver necrosis. \u2022 Post-hepatic icterus may occur due to alimenteric lymphoma.\n\n\u2022 Sneezing, nasal discharge, pneumonia, bronchitis and pyothorax occur in some FeLV-infected cats from immunosuppression and secondary infections. \u2022 Dyspnea and restrictive breathing pattern with muffled heart or lung sounds are common in cats with thymic lymphoma; these cats are generally < 3 years of age and may have decreased cranial chest compliance on palpation.\n\n\u2022 Mediastinal (thymic), multicentric and alimenteric lymphoma are common neoplasms associated with FeLV. \u2022 Fibrosarcomas occasionally develop in young cats co-infected with FeLV and feline sarcoma virus. \u2022 Lymphocytic, myelogenous, erythroid and megakaryocytic leukemia all are reported secondary to FeLV infection; myelodysplasia and myelofibrosis also occur.\n\n\u2022 Urinary tract problems most frequently associated with FeLV-infected cats are urinary incontinence and renal failure. \u2022 Renal failure is generally secondary to renal lymphoma or glomerulonephritis. \u2022 Urinary incontinence has been predominantly a small bladder, nocturnal incontinence that appears to be caused by either sphincter incompetence or detrusor hyperactivity.\n\n\u2022 Intraocular lymphoma induces uveitis and glaucoma in some cats; cats are generally presented for miosis, blepharospasm or cloudy eyes.\n\n\u2022 Aqueous flare, mass lesions, keratic precipitates, lens luxations and glaucoma are often found on ocular examination. \u2022 If anterior uveitis is present, the abnormality is usually because of co-infection with FIP, T. gondii, C. neoformans or FIV.\n\n\u2022 FeLV-infected queens may be presented for abortion, stillbirth or infertility. \u2022 Kittens that are infected in utero but survive to parturition generally develop accelerated FeLV syndromes or die as a part of the kitten mortality complex.\n\nNeurologic abnormalities.\n\n\u2022 Nervous system disease is likely to develop due to polyneuropathy or lymphoma. \u2022 Neurologic abnormalities are occasionally secondary to other infectious agents like FIP or T. gondii. \u2022 Anisocoria, ataxia, weakness, behavioral change and urinary incontinence are the most common neurologic signs. \u2022 Neurologic examination commonly reveals tetraparesis or paraparesis and decreased conscious proprioception. \u2022 Leukemic cells were detected in the bone marrow of 69% of a group of cats with spinal lymphoma.\n\n\u2022 Concurrent infections by viral, bacterial, fungal, rickettsial and parasitic agents are commonly detected in FeLV seropositive cats; it is difficult clinically to determine which are primary and which are secondary to FeLV-induced immunosuppression. \u2022 A strong association exists between FeLV and infections with feline infectious peritonitis virus and hemotropic mycoplasmas (previously Haemobartonella felis). \u2022 Secondary infections may be more difficult to treat in FeLV-infected cats that are immunosuppressed.\n\n\u2022 Multiple cartilaginous exostosis occur in some cats. \u2022 Polyarthritis with resultant stiffness and lameness with or without swollen, hot and painful joints occurs in some cats and has been attributed to immune complex deposition.\n\n\u2022 Anemia is common; non-regenerative anemia occurs alone or in combination with decreases in lymphocytes, neutrophils and platelets. \u2022 Evidence of abnormal red blood cell release from the bone marrow characterized by increased numbers of circulating nucleated red blood cells without an appropriate reticulocytosis is common. \u2022 Examination of bone marrow often documents a maturation arrest in the erythroid line. \u2022 Regenerative anemia is detected in some cats with immune-mediated destruction of erythrocytes induced by FeLV or in some cats co-infected with M. haemofelis. \u2022 Microagglutination of erythrocytes or positive direct Coomb's testing occurs in some cats. \u2022 Neutropenia occurs in some due to bone marrow suppression or immune-mediated destruction. \u2022 Renal azotemia occurs in cats with renal lymphoma. \u2022 Hyperbilirubinemia occurs due to pre-hepatic hemolytic anemia or hepatic disease associated with lymphosarcoma. \u2022 Increased activities of liver enzymes develop secondary to hepatic lipidosis or hepatic lymphosarcoma. \u2022 Proteinuria occurs in some FeLV-infected cats secondary to glomerulonephritis. \u2022 Malignant lymphocytes characteristic of FeLVinduced lymphosarcoma are easily identified cytologically, and occasionally are identified in peripheral blood smears and in cerebrospinal fluid. \u2022 Leukemias can be detected in peripheral blood smears and on bone marrow aspirates.\n\nDetection of FeLV antigens in neutrophils and platelets by IFA or in whole blood, plasma, serum, saliva or tears by ELISA are most commonly used clinically to document infection by FeLV.\n\nAntibody titers to FeLV envelope antigens (neutralizing antibody) and against virus-transformed tumor cells (FOCMA antibody) are available in some research laboratories but clinical use is limited due to poor prognostic value.\n\nResults of IFA and ELISA testing during the dissemination of FeLV are listed under Pathogenesis.\n\n\u2022 The ELISA can detect p27 antigen prior to infection of bone marrow and release of infected neutrophils and platelets and so can be positive in some cats during early stages of infection or during selflimiting infection even though IFA results are negative. \u2022 Positive serum test results occur anywhere between 2 and 30 weeks (generally 2-8 weeks) after infection. \u2022 Systemic epithelial tissue (including salivary glands and tear glands) infection occurs after bone marrow infection. \u2022 There is generally a delay of 1-2 weeks after the onset of viremia before ELISA tear and saliva tests become positive. \u2022 Since p27 can be detected by ELISA in cats that are developing self-limiting infection, all cats positive by serum ELISA should have the results confirmed immediately by IFA or should be isolated and retested by ELISA in 4-6 weeks. \u2022 Some ELISA-positive cats that revert to negative have become latently infected; the majority of latently infected cats are negative by ELISA and IFA but the virus can be isolated from the bone marrow. \u2022 False-positive ELISA results can develop secondary to poor laboratory technique and are more common with whole blood, tears or saliva than with serum or plasma. \u2022 False-negative ELISA using tears or saliva occur during early stages of infection. \u2022 Propionibacterium acnes. Activation of macrophages and natural killer cells. Increased production of interferon, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin 1. 0.5 ml IV, twice weekly for 2 weeks followed by 0.5 ml IV, weekly for 20 weeks. \u2022 Acemannan. Enhanced release of tumor necrosis factor, prostaglandin E 2 , and interleukin 1-alpha by macrophages. 2 mg/kg, IP, once weekly for 6 weeks. \u2022 Pind-orf. Inactivated parapox ovis virus.\n\nAntibiotics are often indicated for secondary infections and should be used at the high end of the dose range for an extended duration.\n\nSupportive care including fluid therapy, appetite stimulants and enteral nutrition supplied via force feeding or nasogastric, pharyngostomy, gastrostomy or jejunostomy tube placement may be indicated.\n\nBlood transfusions, erythropoietin, hematinic agents, vitamin B12, folic acid and anabolic steroids generally have been unsuccessful in the management of the nonregenerative anemia.\n\nImmunosuppressive therapy may be required in the management of hemolytic anemia but has the potential for virus activation.\n\nThe majority of cats (> 80%) with persistent viremia will die of an FeLV-related illness within 2-3 years.\n\nMost cats with self-limiting infection will be subclinically affected.\n\nAvoid exposure; house cats indoors.\n\nTest and removal of seropositive cats can result in virus-free catteries and multiple-cat households.\n\nMultiple FeLV vaccines have been developed and licensed in the last several years. \u2022 Due to variation in challenge study methodology and the difficulty of assessing preventable fraction of a disease with a relatively low infection rate, long subclinical phase, and multiple field strains, efficacy of individual vaccines continues to be in question.\n\n\u2022 Vaccination of cats not previously exposed to FeLV should be considered in cats at high risk (i.e. particularly kittens less than 1 year old in contact with potentially infected cats). \u2022 Owners should be warned of the potential efficacy of less than 100%. \u2022 Cats should be tested for FeLV prior to vaccination. \u2022 Vaccination is not indicated in seropositive cats. \u2022 Vaccination does not induce seropositivity. \u2022 Soft tissue sarcomas develop at the vaccination site in 1:1000 to 1:10 000 cats given adjuvanted vaccines.\n\nWhile FeLV will grow in some human cell cultures (with the exception of subgroup A), antigens of FeLV have never been documented in the serum of humans suggesting that this virus is species specific.\n\nHuman complement lyses FeLV.\n\n\u2022 Lethargy, anorexia, weight loss. \n\nAnemia is not usually a main presenting sign, and occurs as a consequence of chronic disease. Signs of the agent predominate.\n\nTypically FIP presents as fever, weight loss, anorexia and lethargy. Highly proteinaceous pleural or abdominal effusions may be present, or there may be evidence of hepatic, renal, ocular or CNS disease.\n\nCats with signs from FIV often have lethargy, anorexia and weight loss associated with secondary infections of the skin, and gastrointestinal or respiratory tracts.\n\nDiagnosis of FIV is based on the appropriate antibody test, whereas pre-mortem diagnosis of FIP is usually presumptive, unless biopsy samples are available for histological examination.\n\n\u2022 Lethargy, anorexia and depression.\n\n\u2022 Other specific signs of the toxin.\n\n\u2022 Vomiting and diarrhea are common.\n\nUsually there is a history of exposure to the drug or toxin; grizeofulvin, azathioprine, estrogens, chloramphenicol, some chemotherapeutic agents and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents are most common.\n\nMechanism varies with the toxin. Bone marrow suppression (azathioprine, estrogens, chloramphenicol, chemotherapeutic agents) is the mechanism for nonregenerative anemia. Any drug can be protein bound and serve as a hapten for secondary immunemediated hemolytic anemia (see Regenerative anemia). Other drugs and toxins result in bleeding (see Regenerative anemia). Idiosyncratic reactions can occur with most drugs or toxins, but each one listed here also is an intrinsic toxin damaging the bone marrow if the toxic dose is exceeded.\n\nWeakness, lethargy, pale mucous membranes, tachycardia and tachypnea may be present due to anemia.\n\nOther clinical findings from the toxin inducing nonregenerative anemia may be present.\n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents can cause clinical findings consistent with gastrointestinal bleeding or renal disease.\n\nSevere normocytic-normochromic, non-regenerative anemia.\n\nMost drugs and toxins damage the bone marrow and so have concurrent thrombocytopenia and neutropenia.\n\nSince bone marrow damage is present, anemia may be severe.\n\nBone marrow hypoplasia can be documented by cytologic examination of bone marrow aspirates or histology of core biopsies but these techniques do not prove the cause of damage.\n\nHistorical evidence of exposure to a drug or toxin is the best way to determine cause of anemia.\n\nFeLV, myelophthitic disease, ehrlichiosis.\n\nWhole blood transfusions are given as needed.\n\nRecombinant erythropoietin can be administered as described for renal failure-associated non-regenerative anemia, but is unlikely to be effective since maximal erythropoietin responses are likely occurring.\n\nAntibiotics may be indicated if fever due to neutropenia is occurring.\n\n\u2022 Lethargy, anorexia and depression.\n\nAbnormalities result from neoplastic infiltration (lymphoma and myeloproliferative neoplasms most common) into the bone marrow inducing loss of normal bone marrow cells.\n\nFindings may be consistent with the primary neoplasia; i.e. masses.\n\nWeakness, tachycardia and pale mucous membranes result from anemia.\n\nBleeding results from thrombocytopenia.\n\nPancytopenia (aplastic anemia) is most common; pure red cell aplasia is unusual.\n\nLymphoma, myeloproliferative disease or multiple myeloma are often detected on bone marrow cytology or biopsy.\n\nCirculating malignant cells may be detected.\n\nFeLV, drugs or toxins, ehrlichiosis.\n\nTreat the neoplasm primarily.\n\nSupportive care.\n\n\u2022 Lethargy, anorexia, depression and fever.\n\n\u2022 Lameness from polyarthritis. \u2022 Pale mucous membranes.\n\nIt is unknown how clinically ill, naturally exposed cats are infected with an Ehrlichia canis-like organism.\n\nIxodes spp. ticks have been associated with several cases with Anaplasma phagocytophilum (previously E. equi) infection.\n\nExposure to arthropods has been reported in about 30% of the cases in the literature.\n\nPathogenesis is unknown, but it is likely similar to dogs based on clinical and laboratory findings.\n\nIn dogs, infection may result in either a regenerative or non-regenerative anemia.\n\nEarly in infection, acute aplastic anemia occurs because of destruction of progenitor and proliferative cells in the bone marrow. The resulting anemia is usually mild or absent because of the long erythrocyte lifespan.\n\nSecondary immune-mediated anemia may occur.\n\nIn the chronic phase of the disease, hemopoietic stem cell injury results in moderate to severe non-regenerative anemia.\n\nCats experimentally infected with Neorickettsia risticii develop morulae in mononuclear cells and occasionally develop fever, depression, lymphadenopathy, anorexia and diarrhea.\n\nCats experimentally infected with A. phagocytophilum develop morulae in neutrophils and eosinophils.\n\nCases proven by genetic sequencing were E. canis (North America and France) or A. phagocytophilum (Sweden, Ireland, Denmark and North America).\n\nEhrlichia-like morula have been detected in mononuclear cells or neutrophils of naturally exposed cats in the United States, Kenya, France, Sweden, Brazil and Thailand.\n\nOther cases have been diagnosed based on the combination of positive E. canis or A. phagocytophilum serology, clinical or laboratory findings consistent with ehrlichial infection, exclusion of other causes, and response to an anti-rickettsial drug. However, it is unknown whether these cats were ill from the Ehrlichia spp. infection.\n\nCats are usually young and both males and females have been affected.\n\nCats infected by A. phagocytophilum have only been diagnosed in areas with Ixodes ticks.\n\nFever, inappetence, lethargy, weight loss, hyperesthesia or joint pain, and pale mucous membranes are the most common abnormalities. Splenomegaly, dyspnea, uveitis, diarrhea and lymphadenomegaly are also detected in some.\n\nConcurrent diseases are rarely reported but included hemotropic Mycoplasma infection and lymphosarcoma.\n\nAnemia was reported for some cats; most are nonregenerative and both cats with known regenerative anemia were infected with a hemotropic Mycoplasma spp.\n\nLeukopenia, leukocytosis characterized neutrophilia, lymphocytosis, monocytosis, and intermittent thrombocytopenia can occur.\n\nThromobocytopenia is the most common abnormality in cats infected by A. phagocytophilum.\n\nHyperglobulinemia was reported for some cats; protein electrophoresis documented polyclonal gammopathy in the cat assayed.\n\nEpidemiologic associations have been made with ocular discharge, monoclonal gammopathy or polyarthritis in E. canis seropositive cats and with outdoor exposure and vomiting in N. risticii seropositive cats.\n\nMorulae appear as clusters of short rods in the cytoplasm of leukocytes.\n\nDetermination of species by PCR or culture and electron microscopy.\n\nPresumptive diagnosis based on the combination of positive serologic test results, clinical signs of disease consistent with Ehrlichia infection, exclusion of other causes of the disease syndrome, and response to antirickettsial drugs.\n\nSome cats with suspected clinical ehrlichiosis had antibodies against E. canis and N. risticii and some had antibodies against E. risticii alone or E. canis alone.\n\nPositive serologic test results occur in healthy cats as well as clinically ill cats, and so a diagnosis of clinical ehrlichiosis should not be based on serologic test results alone.\n\nSome cats proven by PCR assay to be infected by an E. canis like organism were negative for E. canis antibodies.\n\nAll cats proven by PCR assay to be infected by A. phagocytophilum have also been seropositive.\n\nInfectious, neoplastic, or immune-mediated diseases resulting in fever, polyarthritis and anemia.\n\nClinical improvement after therapy with tetracycline, doxycycline, or imidocarb dipropionate was reported for most cats.\n\nDoxycycline at 10 mg/kg, PO, q 24 h, for a minimum of 4 weeks.\n\nImidocarb at 5 mg/kg, IM, q 14 days for 2 doses.\n\nGood.\n\nAvoid exposure, house cats indoors.\n\nEhrlichia canis and A. phagocytophilum infect people as well as cats. However, transmission is from tick exposure not contact with cats.\n\nIf indicated, use tick control on high-risk cats.\n\nClassical signs \u2022 Lethargy, anorexia and depression.\n\nMost cases of pure red cell aplasia are thought to be due to primary or secondary immune-mediated destruction of red blood cell precursors.\n\nLethargy or weakness, pale mucous membranes, and elevated heart and respiration rates occur at rest.\n\nClinical course may be protracted due to the slow development of anemia.\n\nFeline leukemia virus infection, drugs and toxins should be excluded.\n\nCBC generally reveals severe normocytic-normochromic, non-regenerative anemia with normal neutrophil and platelet numbers.\n\nBone marrow examination reveals either maturation arrest or lack of erythroblasts.\n\nIFA or polymerase chain reaction for FeLV should be performed on bone marrow cells.\n\nSpherocytes, positive direct Coomb's test results and autoagglutination might be present in some affected animals.\n\nFeLV, myelophthitic disease, ehrlichiosis, anemia of chronic disease.\n\nImmunosuppressive therapy as described for regenerative hemolytic anemia (see page 533) should be prescribed.\n\nSeveral blood transfusions may be required; since the bone marrow is involved, response to therapy is more delayed.\n\nRecombinant erythropoietin can be administered as described for renal failure-associated non-regenerative anemia (see page 540), but is unlikely to be effective since maximal erythropoietin responses are likely occurring.\n\n\u2022 Lethargy, anorexia and depression.\n\nFolic acid is required for DNA synthesis, which is important in red blood cell production; insufficient folic acid results in macrocytic anemia as a matura-tion defect. Mechanisms include folic acid antagonist administration, dietary insufficiency, malabsorption and congenital defect.\n\nHistory of chronic (> 2 weeks) administration of folic acid antagonists including pyrimethamine and sulfa drugs.\n\nClinical signs are associated with anemia and those of the disease the antibiotic was being used to treat.\n\nDiarrhea and weight loss may be associated with malabsorption syndromes.\n\nThe cat may have been fed a folic acid deficient diet like tuna.\n\nMacrocytic-hypochromic, or macrocytic-normochromic non-regenerative anemia with nuclear remnants.\n\nNeutropenia with hypersegmented neutrophils may be present History of drug administration.\n\nBone marrow cytology shows erythroid hyperplasia and megaloblastic changes.\n\nSerum folate concentrations decreased (normal = 13-38 \u03bcg/L) with normal cobalamin concentrations.\n\nStop drug treatment.\n\nFolic acid supplementation at 0.004-0.01 mg/kg/day, PO.\n\nSigns resolve within 3 weeks of supplementation.\n\n\u2022 Lethargy, anorexia and depression.\n\nMost commonly develops from chronic loss of blood from the body.\n\nPoor coat, seborrhea sicca, slow hair regrowth after clipping and thick skin.\n\nNormocytic-normochromic, non-regenerative anemia usually with a PCV of 15-27.\n\nDecreased total and free T4 concentrations after treatment for hyperthyroidism.\n\nLevothyroxine supplementation (see page 1354)."}
