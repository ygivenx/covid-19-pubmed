{"title": "Transmission Dynamics of 2019-nCoV in Malaysia", "body": "On 31 December 2019, China notified an outbreak pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan City to the World Health Organization (WHO) and it had been identified as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). In January 2020, several cases were confirmed outside the Mainland of China and hence WHO has declared 2019-nCoV as a global health emergency. Approximately one month since the notification to the WHO, there were 24,663 confirmed 2019-nCoV cases worldwide where 29 countries were affected. January 25 in Malaysia, the Ministry of Health (MoH) reported the first three confirmed cases of whom are of China nationality. The three infected patients were reported to have entered Malaysia from Singapore of which two days earlier, a confirmed case was notified by the Singapore authorities. The first infected Malaysian was reported on February 4. Based on the patient mobility report prior to the notification, it was noted that he was in Singapore for a week starting on January 16, 2020 to attend an international conference where some of the conference delegates were reported to have come from China. It was noted that this patient's symptoms appear on 23 January and he only seek for treatment on January 29 and was referred to the Sungai Buloh Hospital on February 2.\n\nThe current understanding of the 2019-nCoV is that there is a possibility that the novel coronavirus can be asymptomatic. Thus, this paper aims to add insights into the epidemiology of 2019-nCoV by simulating the transmission dynamics of 2019-nCoV in Malaysia when one local human was infected.\n\nThe transmission model was formulated based on the epidemiology aspects of the disease:\n\n(a) In this study, Malaysia's population is divided into the SEIR compartmental model which consists of four compartments: Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected (I) and Recovered (R). The total population of Malaysia is denoted as N and it is assumed that the population is homogeneous. It is assumed that initially the total population is susceptible, hence S0 = N.\n\n(b) Based on the growing number of cases worldwide within a short period, the disease is assumed to spread sufficiently fast that the birth and the natural death rates can be considered as negligible in the model.\n\n.

Since the patient zero may be infectious and was mobile and freely interacting then susceptible human becomes exposed with the disease at a transmission rate f. Once exposed, the incubation period starts and then after the period ends then those exposed moves to the Infected compartment at a rate c and when they recovered from the disease then they will move to the Recovered compartment at a rate k. However, there are some infected cases who may die due to the disease with the given rate of d.\n\nThe differential equations (equations (1) -(4)) which describe the dynamics of the 2019-nCoV in human populations are formulated based on the compartmental diagram described earlier in Figure 1 .\n\n!'\n\nThe descriptions of the parameters and their values used for the simulation is shown in Table 1 . 1 c Incubation Period 6.5 [2] f Transmission rate of I to S 1.07 [3] 1 k Infectious Period 3.6 [3] d Death rate of 2019-nCoV 0.03 Estimated based on current statistics .

Hence the initial time (t0) is set to January 23, 2020 and I0 is 1. E0 and R0 are assigned to 0. Matlab 2019 is used in this study to simulate the SEIR model formulated using the parameter values listed in Table 1 . Figure 2 depicts the simulation of the SEIR model for the first ten days since the on-set date. Based on the result, the number of cases will increase to two persons which indicate that the second case will be confirmed on t = 8.74 which is approximately on the 9 th day after on-set date of the first case, that is on the 1 st February 2020.\n\n.

This means that if there is no control intervention imposed on the situation then the disease will be able to infect more than 3 million in the country.\n\nThe 2019-nCoV SEIR model was simulated using the parameters values obtained from trusted sources. The model is found to be accurate as it is able to predict the second confirmed case in Malaysia as reported on February 7 by the MoH [5] . One of the parameters used, namely the incubation period, was actually estimated by [2] based on 88 confirmed cases detected outside of Wuhan, China. Our simulation has managed to verify the proposed incubation period of 6.5 days at which according to the MoH report [5] , the second case has developed symptoms on the 1 st February 2020 which is in agreement with the prediction of our model. We have also shown through the simulation the seriousness of the spread of the disease if there is no control measure is taken.\n\n.
