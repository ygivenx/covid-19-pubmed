{"title": "MIGRATION OF SCHWANN CELLS REQUIREMENTS FOR SCHWANN CELL MIGRATION WITHIN CNS ENVIRONMENTS: A VIEWPOINT", "body": "The central nervous system can be defined as that part of the nervous system enclosed within an environment of neuroectoderm-derived astrocytes. Its boundaries are defined by the glia limitans, the basal lamina-covered layer of astrocyte processes which lies beneath the pia mater and next to blood vessels. Although Schwann cells can occasionally be found associating with axons within the normal central nervous system, they are not a normal cellular component of the undamaged central nervous system. However, Schwann cells can migrate into areas of damaged CNS where they remyelinate axons that were once myelinated by oligodendrocytes and enclosed within the astrocytic environment of the CNS. This review will examine the circumstances under which Schwann cells enter the CNS in normal and pathological situations in order to identify the rules by which this invasion and migration are governed.\n\nCentral to an understanding of what influences migration of Schwann cells into and within the CNS are the answers to the following three questions: what attracts the Schwann cells into the CNS in pathological situations where they are found myelinating CNS axons, what prevents or limits their entry in normal and pathological situations, and what substrates do the cells need for movement? By reviewing the behaviour of Schwann cells under normal and pathological circumstances, and testing hypotheses arising from such studies by glial cell transplantation, it is possible to provide some of the answers to these questions.\n\nAt the transition zone between PNS and CNS, where cranial and spinal nerve roots join the neuraxis, there is an orderly transition from Schwann cell myelination to oligodendrocyte myelination of axons, which is accompanied by the appearance of astrocytes at the node of Ranvier where the transition takes place. 24 At this point of transition the astrocyte surface abutting the Schwann cell is invariably coated by a basal lamina which is continuous with that of the glia limitans. This sharp demarcation is even seen in situations where CNS axons are not myelinated, such as the myelin-deficient rat and the jimpy mouse. 22 A similar demarcation is also seen in rare situations close to the root transition zone where \"islands\" Schwann cells are occasionally found myelinating CNS axons or where \"islands\" of central glial cells occur in nerve roots in normal animals, 24 where Schwann cells are occasionally found myelinating CNS axons in normal animals,18,37,44 and more extensively in mutants such as the Browman-Wyse rat.2 Thus, in situations where there has been no pathological alteration to astrocytes there is a sharp transition from Schwann cell to central glia ensheathment of axons. The central glia ensheathment may be by astrocytes alone, or by oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. Intermixing of oligodendrocyte and Schwann cell myelination of axons is never seen in normal animals.\n\nThere are a number of pathological situations in which Schwann cell myelination of CNS axons occurs, and they are invariably associated with disturbance to the integrity of the glia limitans. Almost without exception, Schwann cell invasion only occurs when axons which should or could he myelinated by oligodendrocytes are present.\n\nFollowing X-irradiation of the neonatal spinal cord, Schwann cells can be observed passing through the glia limitans and myelinating CNS axons. \",42*43 X-irradiation of the developing spinal cord just prior to myelination not only prevents the generation of myelin-forming oligodendrocytes 29 but will also compromise the generation of astrocytes needed to accommodate the increase in size of the spinal cord which results from the rapid increase in axon diameter which precedes myelination. This failure of astrocytes to maintain the integrity of the CNS environment allows Schwann cells to enter the CNS and myelinate axons. It is useful to compare the X-irradiation situation to the myelin-deficient rat. In the MD rat there is a similar failure of myelination. due to degeneration of myelinating oligodendrocytes. However, in contrast to the X-irradiated neonatal cord, there is no compromise to the astrocytes. This means that the glia limitans remains intact throughout development, and hence there is no Schwann cell invasion (Fig. 1) . The importance of the intact glia limitans in preventing this invasion is best illustrated by the observation that Schwann cells will myelinate CNS axons following X-irradiation of the spinal cord of MD rat neonatesz2 The demyelinated axons therefore reside in an environment which, in terms of the glial population, is neither CNS nor PNS. If such a lesion is created in X-irradiated white matter, this situation presists indefinitely, and thus provides a useful 'test-bed' in which to examine how transplanted glia interact with demyelinated axons. ii-Ethidium bromide lesions created in normal, non-irradiated white matter undergo spontaneous repair. The nature of this repair process reveals the mutual exclusion between PNS and CNS glia that is the key to understanding the behaviour of Schwann cells within the CNS. The demyelinated axons are remyelinated by either Schwann ceils or oligodendrocytes.\n\nThe oligodendrocyte remyelination is confined to the edges of the lesion where astrocytes have re-established.\n\nSchwann cell remyelination is confined to the centre of the lesion where astrocytes are absent. The boundary between the two types of repair is a basal lamina-coated astrocytic surface that resembles, and is continuous with, the glia limitans. In spite of the large numbers of Schwann cells within a repaired ethidium bromide lesion, they are rarely present on the \"CNS\" side of the reconstituted gha limitans.\n\nDisruption of the glia limitans and demyelination of CNS axons are both consequences of spinal cord trauma. Schwann cell myelination of CNS axons is frequently seen following naturally occurring and experimentally induced spinal cord trauma. 16,32.34 The axons of retinal ganglion cells of the rat are normally not myelinated. However, following trauma to the retina and choroid, Schwann cell myelination of these axons can be observed and it is of particular interest that the extent of Schwann cell myelination is influenced by the animals age.40 There are several possible explanations for this observation: (1) the recruitment signal for attracting Schwann cells is greater in developing animals; (2) Schwann cells become less responsive to these signals with age; or (3) the ability of astrocytes to exclude Schwann cells increases with age. When Schwann cells are found myelinating axons in the retina in this and other situations, the areas of myelination are restricted, indicating that factors other than the presence of axons available for myelination play a significant role in controlling Schwann cell myelination of CNS axons.\n\nThe tendency for Schwann cells to myelinate CNS axons in situations where astrocytes are compromised following trauma occurs in vertebrate classes other than mammals. Following crush lesions of the goldfish optic nerve there is a local loss of astrocytes. As the severed retinal ganglion cells regenerate through this region, the regenerated axons are myelinated by Schwann cells. Where the axons pass back into an astrocyte-containing area they are myelinated by oligodendrocytes.38\n\nWhen substances which kill glialcells (gliotoxins) are injected into white matter tracts of the spinal cord, there is a clear association between loss of astrocytes, the presence of demyelinated axons and the myelination of CNS axons by Schwann cells 3,4,6,31 (Fig. 2) . Thus, injections of ethidium bromide and 6-aminonicotinamide into the dorsal columns of rats, substances which intoxicate both oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, results in extensive Schwann cell myelination of CNS axons. while lysolecithin, which is more selectively toxic to oligodendrocytes, results in Schwann cell remyelinntion being limited to the central parts of the area of demyelination. ' In the cat. for example, it is possible to produce Schwann cell myelination across almost the entire transverse area of the dorsal funiculus by the injection of 2 ~1 of 0.05% ethidium bromide. Results obtained with 6-arnirl~~riic~~tjnamide are particularly interesting because they reveal how Schwann cells behave when they gain access to grey matter. In this location they relate to lieurons and synapses in a manner similar to that seen in peripheral ganglia.7 Similar observation can be made following X-irradiation of the neonatal rat spinal cordi and following systemic intoxication with a number of agents which show selective gliotoxicity.'\"\n\nSchwann cell myelination of demyelinated axons can occur the spinal cord.\"x. 36.3s in some MS playues. notably those in It is most prevalent in Japanese MS patients who suffer a more fulminating form of the disease?' It is also a feature of some experimentally-induced virus infections in experimental animals2'~4' and certain forms of experimental ailergic encephalomyelitis.~' tlgain. an association between astrocyte loss and Schwann cell remyclinati~~n is observed.'6.\"4\n\nThe common theme that emerges for all of these examples is the clear rcl~~tionship between destruction of the astrocytes which constitute the glia limitans, the presence of demyeIinat~d axons and Schwann cell myelination of CNS axons. The technique of glial cell transplantation has enabled this relationship to be studied in greater depth.\n\niii Fig. 3 . The manner in which Schwann cells migrate within a glia-free area of drmyelination becomes apparent when Schwann cells arc transplanted into the sub-arachnoid space above an X-irradiated ethidium bromide lesion.x i-Schwann cells enter the lesion along blood vessels (BV), using the perivascular extracellular matrix as a substrate. This same matrix enables the Schwann cells to remyelinate those demyelinated axons immediately adjacent to the blood vessel. Subsequently, remyelination proceeds in a stepwise manner away from the blood vessel. migrating Schwann cells using the basal lamina around established myelinating Schwann cells to reach an available length of demyelinated axon and then invest it with a new myelin sheath. ii-The absence of an cxtracellular matrix within glia-free areas of dtmydination means that Schwann cells are unable to migrate through areas containing only d~myeIinated axons. iii-The absence of extensive Schwann cell remyelination at the edges of the lesion indicate that the extracellular matrix associated with astrocyte surfaces is a minor route of entry into the lesion from the subarachnoid space compared with the blood vessel route. If spinal cord white matter is subjected to 40 Grays of X-irradiation prior to inducing demyelination by the injection of gliotoxins, the normal repair response which follows such an injection does not take place15 (Fig. 2i) . Consequently, the demyelinated axons remain demyelinated and the lesion can be used as a \"test-bed\" to examine how transplanted cells interact with demyelinated axons and each other in glia-free area of demyelination.\n\nWhen a source of Schwann cells, in the form of a segment of predegenerated peripheral nerve, is placed over such areas of demyelination, Schwann cells migrate into the lesion and remyelinate the demyelinated axons. 5,8 With small species such as the rat, the remyelination is rapid and extensive. If, however, the experiments are undertaken in the cat and the transplantation is carried out 14 days after induction of demyelination, the larger size of the lesion together with the absence of inflammatory responses associated with the intraspinal injection, means that the routes by which this migration takes place can be more readily appreciated* (Fig. 3) . In this situation, the restriction of Schwann cell myelination to the perivascular region is striking. When such perivascular clumps of Schwann cells are examined in detail it can be seen that myelination is most advanced adjacent to the blood vessel, with earlier stages of remyelination (engagement, engulfment, spiralling etc) occurring at increasing distances away from the blood vessel. This pattern of remyelination indicates that the perivascular space represents an important avenue of migration for Schwann cells into the CNS, a conclusion supported by a number of other studies. 22,41 Moreover, it also provides information on the manner in which Schwann cells move away from the blood vessel into areas of the lesion containing demyelinated axons. These areas contain no glial cells and the Schwann cells move through the axon environment in a stepwise fashion, engaging demyelinated axons only where they can maintain contact with an established Schwann cell. There was no evidence that Schwann cells could migrate along demyelinated axons which lay in an environment that was both glia-free and devoid of extracellular matrix. Thus, movement of Schwann cells through an environment consisting solely of demyelinated axons is very much more cautious than that through collagen containing areas where one observes multiple Schwann cells interacting with single axons so that remyelination of a lesion proceeds rapidly. These irz vivo observations are entirely consistent with those made 111 vitro, where it was observed that Schwann cells would not myelinate along suspended fascicles 01 neurites, but were able to do so if they could maintain contact with a collagen-coated surface.'7 In vivo the surface may be provided by extracellular matrix or cells, in particular those coated in basal lamina. A further important point to arise from these studies is that Schwann cells respond to a diffusible chemotactic signal, indicated by the migration of Schwann cells from a remote source in response to a lesion containing demyelinated axons. These signals have yet to be identified but the demyelinated axon itself seems a probable source. An appreciation of how the Schwann cells' dependence on contact with a stable extracellular matrix17 will affect the cells behaviour in the CNS is readily appreciated following the injection of Schwann cells into glia-free areas of demyelination in the cat\" (Fig. 4) . When cells are injected into such a lesion they will come to rest next to demyelinated axons in association with one of three structures:\n\n(1) other demyelinated axons; (7) collagen relating to blood vessels or mcningeal surfaces; or (3) astrocyte processes, which extend into the edges of the lesion from the ad,jacent normal tissue (compare Figs 3 and 3) . As Schwann cell myelination is only observed in perivascular areas and adjacent to astrocyte surfaces, and was never seen around axons lying free in cxtracellular space, it can be concluded that in the CNS the stable surface which Schwann cells require to initiate myelination can be provided not only by collagen. but also bv the surface of astrocytcs. Where Schwann cells are observed myelinating demyelinated axons next to astrocyte processes the surface of these cells is invariably coated by a basal lamina.\n\nThus. Schwann cells can migrate towards demyelinated axons from a distant source and thcii major route of migration is along collagen-containing perivascular spaces. Within a lesion cnvironment. migration occurs in association with cells coated in basal lamina such as astrocytcs and myelinating Schwann cells. Collagen is a key component of the extracellular matrix which permits Schwann cell migration and myelination.\n\n\".jy The extracellular space of the normal CNS contains no collagen. but it can be deposited during inflammation, especially when the integrity of the CNS is breached so that pial cells and Schwann cells gain entry into the CNS. cinder such circumstances collagen is deposited in the extracellular space and on the surface of astrocytes. Thus in the absence of collagen deposition Schwann cells migration and myelination will be limited.\n\nThe observations described thus far reveal a paradoxical role for astrocytes with regard to Schwann cell myelination in the CNS. While on the one hand the study of normal and pathological material suggest that the presence of astrocytes prevents Schwann cells entering the CNS, on the other hand. the transplantation studies so far examined indicate that the surface of astrocytes may promote Schwann cell behaviour by providing a surface for migration and myelination.\n\nThus, it appears that astrocytes can play both an inhibitory and facilitatory role with regard to Schwann cell myelination.\n\nThis apparent paradox has been resolved by glial transplantation studies which have indicated that the role played by astrocytes can be directly related to the arrangements they adopt within a repairing lesion.\n\nSome years ago a series of transplantation studies were undertaken to formally test the hypothesis that astrocytes restrict Schwann cell access to CNS axons. These studies made use of the both the non-X-irradiated and X-irradiated ethidium bromide lesion in the rat spinal cord. Central to understanding these experiments are two observations. Firstly, the normalethidium bromide lesion is mainly repaired by Schwann cells, with oligodendrocyte remyelination limited to astrocyte containing areas around the edges of the lesion next to normal white matter.\"' Secondly, all glial cell cultures prepared from the CNS are contaminated by Schwann cells. This point was first established when cultures. ostensibly of CNS glia. were transplanted into non-repairing X-irradiated ethidium bromide lesions and resulted in areas of Schwann cell remyelination.\" Careful examination of the cultures revealed the presence of small numbers of Schwann cells (4%). identified as cells co-expressing S 100 and laminin or L 1. Unless specific steps are taken to remove these cells. they have been identified in all subsequently prepared cultures of CNS glia. Thus, following transplantation into the non-irradiated lesion, Schwann cells are of both host origin and transplant origin, whereas, in the X-irradiated lesion they are exclusively of transplant origin. The predominantly Schwann cell-repaired ethidium bromide lesion can be changed to one where most remyelination is by oligodendrocytes by transplanting mixed CNS cultures. If the proportion of astrocytes within the transplant is reduced this change does not occur, and the majority of axons are remyelinated by Schwann cells despite the increased number of central myelinating cells. Taken together, these two results indicate that the presence of astrocytes is necessary to prevent extensive Schwann cell remyelination and is consistent with an inhibitory role for astr0cytes.l' Interestingly, the shift towards oligodendrocyte remyelination is not as great if astrocytes alone are transplanted, a result which suggests that the ability of astrocytes to control the invasion of Schwann cells may be related to the availability of oligodendrocyte lineage cells. Following transplantation of a mixed culture, these cells are in abundance. However, following transplantation of astrocytes alone, the host is the only source of oligodendrocyte-linkage cells?5 The interaction between oligodendroc~e-lineage cells and astrocytes in controlling Schwann cell invasion can be investigated further using the X-irradiated ethidium bromide lesion, where the presence of Schwann cells can be confined to the small contaminating population within the transplant. When a mixed population of central glia is transplanted into a non-irradiated lesion, all but a few axons are remyelinated by oligodendrocytes. l1 However, as the proportion of transplanted oligodendrocytes is reduced, a level is reached below which the astrocytes within the transplant are unable to prevent the co-transplanted Schwann cells from becoming the dominant myelinating cell within the lesion. 2o Thus, oligodendrocyte lineage cells are required in order for astrocytes to contain the small population of Schwann cells. When astrocytes are transplanted with a small contaminating population of Schwann cells and no oligodendrocyte lineage cells, the failure of astrocytes to control the Schwann cells again becomes evident. 26 In this latter situation, transplanted astrocytes are confined to small, basal-lamina bound islands or clumps of cells that contain a few axons. The majority of axons remain outside these small islands and are remyelinated by Schwann cells, which presumabIy make use of the basal lamina associated with the astrocyte to migrate and myelinate (Fig. 4iii) .\n\nThe arrangement adopted by transplanted astrocytes when oligodendrocyte-lineage cells are present or absent is therefore quite different. When oligodendrocytes are present the two cell types combine to reconstruct an extensive glial environment containing many oligodendrocyte remyelinated axons contained within a glia limitans. Schwann cell remyelination is restricted to those axons that are \"outside\". Thus, the normal relationship between CNS and PNS is re-created by the transplanted cells. In the absence of oligodendrocytes, although a glia limitans is established by transplanted astrocytes most of the demyelinated axons lie \"outside\". What is interesting to note is that when astrocytes are transplanted without Schwann cells, the tendency of astrocytes to aggregate so as to exclude demyelinated axons is not pronounced, suggesting that it is the Schwann cells that induce this behaviour in the transplanted astrocytes.27\n\nThe ability of an established astrocyticenvironment to contain and limit the behaviour of Schwann cells within the CNS is most obviously revealed when Schwann cells are introduced directly into astrocyte containing areas. When Schwann cells are injected into the normal CNS, few if any cells can be detected 1 month after transplantation. ',12 Moreover, an astrocytosis is detected around the implantation site that appears to be induced by the Schwann cells.' Thus, when Schwann cells are transplanted into the developing CNS, it appears that the Schwann cells are not merely confined to the area around the point of injection but are actively extruded by astrocytes when they do establish within the substance of the CNS. Attempts to introduce Schwann cells into areas containing large diameter unmyelinated axons and astrocytes, such as occurs in the retina, results in very little Schwann cell remyelination despite there being axons available to be myelinated.lO The same is also true of Schwann cell transplants into the myelin deficient ratz (Fig. 1) . It would therefore appear that not only are Schwann cells unable to gain entry into astrocytic environments in mature animals, but their presence also stimulates an astrocytic response.\n\nIn this review we have described a number of examples which support the notion that Schwann cell migration and my&nation within the CNS can be related to the presence or absence of an intact astrocytic environment. In essence, there is a \"mutual exclusion\" between the two cells types, a phenomenon which can be related to the epithelial properties manifested by both cells. A feature of epithelial cells is their association with a basal lamina along one surface, a feature also exhibited by both axon-associating Schwann cells and astrocytes of both the normal or reconstructed glia limitans. It is a basic principle of development that basal lamina formation separates IIOIIcompatible tissue elements and there is a sharp transition between one type of epithelia) ccl1 and the next when they share the same basal lamina. as occurs for instance in the respiratory and digestive systems. In these latter systems, if one cell type should degenerate, the territory previously occupied by that cell type can be taken over by its neighbour. This process wilt continue until viable epithelium is reached, when the invasion ceases and a new boundary is cstablishcd. It would appear, therefore, that in their interactions astrocytes and Schwann cells manifest all the basic behaviour of epithelial cells. With this appreciation it is possible to predict what would happen if one tried to remyelinate multiple sclerosis plaques by transplanting Schwann cells without first removing the astrocytes which surround the demyelinated axons.
