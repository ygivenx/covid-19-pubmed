Thus, the purpose of this study is to perform a systematic review of epidemiological, clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients infected by COVID-19 or MERS-COV disease, and to compare COVID-19 and MERS-COV in the context of their incubation, laboratory features, admission rate of intensive cure unit (ICU) and rate of discharge and fatality, which will provide a comprehensive reference for clinical physicians in treatment of coronavirus diseases.\n\nA comprehensive and systematic search was performed using PubMed, EMBASE and OR (2019 novel coronavirus)). If necessary, we also contacted corresponding author to obtain accurate data.\n\n.

Studies were excluded as following criteria: duplicate publications, case report, meta-analysis, letter, review, technology report, commentary, animal trial, correspondence, predictive study, guidence, radiograph study and meeting report.\n\nAt the beginning, 4743 potential publications were identified. We removed 678 duplicates and reviewed the titles and abstracts of remaining 4065 publications. 4015 publications were excluded for following reasons: not involved research point (n = 1378), review (n = 569), no English (n = 33), case report (n = 316), meta-analysis (n = 1), letter (n = 127), technology report (n = 196), commentaries (n = 61), animal study (n = 1107), correspondence (n = 29), predictive study (n = 110), guidence (n = 28), meeting report ( n = 16) and radiograph (n = 44). Then, a comprehensive review of full-text was conducted for remaining 50 publications. Two reviewers independently screened eligible literature, and any argument was solved by discussion with a third reviewer. Finally, thirty-two studies were included in this study . The process was shown in Figure 1 .\n\nTwo reviewers extracted independently common, clinical and laboratory characteristics of included studies, with disagreements were solved by discussion with a third reviewer. The extracted data included incubation time, white blood cell (WBC) count, lymphocyte count, creactive protein (CRP), alamine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), .

For normality distribution data, outcomes were extracted directly. For skewness distribution data, the outcomes was extracted after being converted as specific formula [40] .\n\nThe quality assessment of included studies was performed through the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS), as recommended by the Cochrane Non-Randomized\n\nStudies [41] . The NOS includes three parts for risk of bias, with nine points in total: (1) selection of research groups (four points); (2) inter-group comparability (two points); and (3) ascertainment of exposure and outcomes (three points) for case-control and cohort studies, respectively. Study that scored 6 or more was qualified for systematic review [42] . The assessment process was completed by two reviewers independently. All debates were solved by discussion with a third reviewer.\n\nAll statistical analyses and graphs were generated and plotted using GraphPad Prism version 7.00 software (GraphPad Software Inc). The p value < 0.05 suggests significant difference.\n\nAll included studies were retrospective study .

Clinical and laboratory characteristics of included study were shown in Table 1 and Table 2 respectively.\n\nAmong thirty-two included studies, four studies obtained 6 points of NOS [26, 28, 32, 35] , and remaining twenty-eight studies obtained 7 points of NOS or more [8-25, 27, 29-31, 33-34, 36-39] .

There was a higher discharge rate in MERS-COV populations compared with COVID-19 population ( 59.9% vs. 33.5%, Figure 3 ). The lower fatality rate was found in COVID-19 population compared with MERS-COV population (6.8% vs. 34.1%, Figure 4 ). \n\nCoronavirus is an important pathogen causing respiratory and intestinal infection. Of seven identified coronaviruses, the two very pathogenic viruses, SARS-COV and MERS-COV, cause severe ARDS and even acute respiratory failure. With a mortality rate of more than 10% and more than 35% respectively [43] [44] . The four other human coronaviruses In addition, we found that the number of males is more than that of females in either COVID-19 or MERS-COV population. The possible reason of reduced susceptibility of females to viral infection is that females have a lot of X chromosome and estrogen that are vital components in development of innate and adaptive immunity [47] . Meanwhile, numbers of patients with COVID-19 infection had chronic comorbidities, mainly hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, which is similar to MERS-COV population. Those results indicate that older adult males with chronic underlying disease might be more susceptibility to COVID-19 or MERS-COV.\n\n.

This result indicates that COVID-19 might be associated with cellular immune response, mainly act on lymphocytes like MERS-COV does [48] . The cells infected by viruses induce the release of numbers of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammation storm in the body. Moreover, increased cytokines might make damage to related organs such as liver [49] . Our results demonstrated that abnormal value of AST was found in MERS-COV population, but not in COVID-19 population. The possible reason is that the follow-up time of COVID-19 population was too short, and the liver might remain to be in compensatory stage. For this result, a long follow-up time study is urgently needed. On the other hand, our results suggested that MERS-COV population had a higher rate of ICU admission and fatality than COVID-19 population, indicating that compared with MERS-COV, COVID-19 has less toxic and more easily cured. However, lower discharge rate was found in COVID population than in MERS-COV population. The possible explanation is that most of COVID-19 patients remained to be hospitalized at the time of manuscript submission, and data on those patients could not be obtained in time. Thus, careful interpretation is urged for this result.\n\nUp to now, no effective strategy has been found for treatment of COVID-19 infection [50] . Currently, the measure to COVID-19 is to control the source of the infection; taking personal protective works to reduce the risk of transmission; and early diagnosing, isolating and supportive treating for confirmed patients. In the present study, our systematic results of cure rate of drug for MERS-COV infection indicated that ribavirin and interferon, oseltamivir, antivirals and intravenous immunoglobulin all had been effective for MERS-COV infection, with the cure rate of those drugs was 74.2%, 69.2%, 67.1% and 62.5% respectively.

However, further studies are needed to confirm this idea.\n\nThis study has several limitations. First, many patients infected by COVID-19 remained to be hospitalized at the time of manuscript submission, leading to the unavailable of some data. Second, the follow-up time of COVID-19 population is too short to get related data from long-term observations of this disease. Third, finding of statistical tests and p values between COVID-19 and MERS-COV populations should be interpreted with caution. Fourth, the number of MERS-COV patients treated by drugs is small, careful understanding is needed for the cure rate of drug for this disease. Finally, as COVID-19 is still developing around the world and remains to have many unknowns, the results of this study are staged and need to be carefully understood. More large-sample, multicentre, high-quality research should be performed to update this study.\n\nOur systematic review reveals that main clinical manifestations of both COVID-19 and MERS-COV populations are fever, cough and generalised weakness and myalgia. ARDS is main complication of both two populations. COVID-19 population has a shorter incubation time and lower rate of ICU admission, discharge and fatality compared with MRES-COV population.\n\nThis study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos.31970862) and Guangzhou Municipal Science and Technology project (Nos.\n\n.
