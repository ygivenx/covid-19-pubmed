Acute viral infections of the ceninfections by variants of the JHM strain (JHMV) of mouse tral nervous system (CNS) result in vigorous, but in some hepatitis virus (MHV). In immunocompromised hosts instances limited, host immune responses (Sedgwick and JHMV replicates unchecked in the CNS demonstrating Dorries, 1991) . In contrast to responses in the periphery the importance of immune effectors in limiting CNS virus where limiting virus replication can generally be carried replication ; Houtman and out with minimal regard to tissue damage, within the CNS Fleming, 1996b; . Effector checks and balances minimize inflammatory-mediated mechanisms implicated in protection and clearance of damage while limiting viral-induced cytopathology. Al-JHMV from the CNS include cell-mediated immunity and though a wide range of immune effectors are often induced, both neutralizing and nonneutralizing antibodies. JHMV predominant anti-viral mechanisms appear related to the provides an interesting paradigm of acute viral encephapathogenesis strategy of the individual agent. For example, litis not only because of its associated demyelination infection of mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (Weiner, 1973; Lampert et al., 1973) but also because induces a predominant CD8 / cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) some immune effector mechanisms prevent death via response (Lehmann et al., 1988) . By contrast, resolution of directly reducing CNS virus replication while other immeasles virus-encephalitis in mice is mediated by CD4 / T mune effectors prevent death without significantly altercells and correlates with the local production of IFN-g ing virus replication Hout-(Finke et al., 1995) .

However, the OBLV-60 JHMV variant is 1995a). A surprising number of mRNAs peaked relatively early cleared from the CNS of IFN-g-deficient mice , consistent with IFN-g exhibiting poor in vitro following JHMV infection.

Similar to the recent data T cells are activated during infection. IL-4 mRNA accumulation in the CNS corresponds to infiltration of Th2 cells demonstrating low levels of iNOS in the CNS of both nude mice and mice deficient in IFN-g , (Cua et al., 1995) and kinetic analysis suggests that T cells expressing Th2 cytokine profiles are recruited into iNOS mRNA in immunodeficient mice was approximately 50% the levels detected in the CNS of intact mice at Day the CNS with nearly equal kinetics in both lethally and sublethally infected mice (Fig. 5A) .

Although JHMV is susceptible to inhibition by iNOS in vitro, iNOS is not associated with in vivo protection severity of encephalitis (Ikemoto et al., 1995) and could potentially play a role in JHMV persistence via inhibition . IL-12, predominantly produced by cells of the myelo-of viral clearance (Moran et al., 1996) . In support of the recruitment of Th2 cells, IL-10 mRNA also increased with monocytic lineage, is associated with the induction of Th1 CD4 / T cells (Brunda, 1994) . IL-12 mRNA peaked kinetics similar to those of IFN-g and IL-4.

However, no significant differences ences in mouse strains or the selective tropism of the virus is not known. It is interesting that although IL-10 is were found comparing mRNA levels in immunodeficient mice to intact mice. This may suggest that JHMV infection secreted by activated microglia in vitro (Lodge and Sriram, 1996) , no IL-10 mRNA was detected in sham-induces transcription of IL-12 mRNA in CNS cells. In addition, 2.2v-1 infects predominantly, but not exclu-infected or immunodeficient mice. This contrasts with other cytokine mRNA detected in either sham-infected sively, oligodendroglia, while JHMV infects predominantly microglia and astrocytes. The relatively higher or virus-infected immunodeficient hosts (see below).\n\nTNF-a mRNA is induced following JHMV infection level of IL-12 mRNA in 2.2v-1-infected mice suggests the possibility that oligodendroglia transcribe IL-12 mRNA in (Pearce et al., 1994; Stohlman et al., 1995a; Sun et al., 1995) and TNF-a is present during both the acute and response to JHMV infection, similar to the induction of IL-12 mRNA following measles virus infection of oligo-persistent JHMV infections.

In addition, inhibition of TNF-a, which prevents 1a mRNA peaks appear to coincide with replication and not clearance, suggesting that infection induces a rapid experimental autoimmune encephalitis (Ruddle et al., 1990) , has no effect on either JHMV-induced encephalitis induction of IL-1a mRNA. These data contrast to the association of IL-1a mRNA and the clearance of the OBLV-or demyelination (Stohlman et al., 1995a) . As anticipated, based on the relative tropism of the two viruses analyzed, 60 variant of JHMV (Pearce et al., 1994) , suggesting an additional difference in cytokine responses depending TNF-a mRNA accumulated initially in the CNS of mice infected with JHMV. However, by Day 5 p.i. there was on the tropism of the virus analyzed.

Finally, the level of TNF-a mRNA decreased with (Pearce et al., 1994) , increased directly after infection at Day 1 p.i.

(Pearce et al., 1994) . Kinetic analysis shows that the levels of IL-6 mRNA peaked at Day 3 post-2.2v-1 infection By contrast the induction of iNOS and IL-1a mRNAs were increased in mice undergoing a lethal infection. These and at Day 5 post-JHMV infection. Interestingly, analysis of the mRNA levels in the immunodeficient mice showed data suggest that an early induction of IL-6, and possibly IL-1b, are associated with sublethal infection or the dif-virtually no induction of IL-6 mRNA, suggesting that in contrast to IL-1a and IL-1b an intact immune response ferent tropisms exhibited by these two JHMV variants. However, during both infections the mRNA levels de-was required for IL-6 mRNA induction. Rapid induction of IL-6 mRNA following JHMV infection is consistent with creased as virus was cleared. Similarly, there appears to be an inverse correlation between a rapid induction other models of viral-induced encephalitis in which it also precedes IFN-g (Moskophidis et al., 1991) . Although of iNOS mRNA and sublethal disease, consistent with the recent demonstration that although iNOS is protective in both IL-6 and IL-10 are cofactors for CTL induction (Chen and Zlotnik, 1991; Takai et al., 1988) , kinetic analysis is vitro, inhibition of iNOS activity in vivo appears to have no effect on JHMV pathogenesis .
