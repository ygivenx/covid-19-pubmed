{"title": "BOVINE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES TO THE F5 (K99) PILUS ANTIGEN OF E. COLI, PRODUCED BY MURINE/BOVINE HYBRI DOMAS", "body": "One of the causative agents of neonatal diarrhoea in calves and other farm animals is non-invasive enterotoxigenic E. coli which have the K99 (now called FS) pilus antigen (K99 + ETEC) (Smith and Linggood 1972) .\n\nFor disease to develop, gut colonization by bacterial adherence to enterocytes is thought to be essential. Preventive and control measures to date including treatment with antibiotics (Kistwaria, Misra and Choudhuri, 1982) and maternal vaccination programmes (Acres, 1985) have met with varying success. Another treatment is to dose calves with antibodies to K99 pilus antigen, and a murine monoclonal anti-K99 antibody has been used for this purpose (Sherman, Acres, Sadowski, Springer, Bray, Raybould and Muscoplat, 1983) .\n\nAs an alternative approach, we have investigated the possibility of making bovine monoclonal antibodies to the K99 pilus antigen on the principle that a homologous antibody might ultimately be more effective than a heterologous antibody.\n\nIn addition, since there are a number of situations in veterinary pathology where the use of a bovine rather than a murine monoclonal antibody would be advantageous (e.g. in studies of host/parasite relationships or where repeated administration of antibody is required) the present investigation was used as a basis to explore the feasibility of making bovine monoclonal antibodies in general.\n\nSince no suitable bovine myeloma lines are yet available, attempts to produce bovine monoclonal immunoglobulins are at present confined to the use of interspecific hybrids made by fusing mouse myeloma cells with ljnnphocytes from immunized cattle. This approach has met with some success Goldsby, 1983, 1984; Tucker, Dain, Clarke and Donker, 1984; Raybould, Crouch, McDougall and Watts 1985) . However, one problem with such interspecific hybrids (xenohybridomas) is that like other somatic cell hybrids (Weiss and Green, 1967; Pontecorvo, 1971 ) they lose the non-murine chromosomes as they divide so that even if at first they secrete immunoglobulins, they usually soon lose the ability to do so. Preliminary experiments at Babraham, indicated that improved stability could be achieved using murine/bovine xenohybridomas (primary xenohybridomas) themselves as fusion partners. First, these had to be grown in the presence of 8-azaguanine to select for aminopterin sensitivity. They were then used as fusion partners with lymphocytes from immunized calves (Tucker et al 1984; Anderson, Clarke, Stein and Tucker, 1986 ). The resulting secondary xenohybridomas were further selected and used as fusion partners to produce tertiary xenohybridomas.\n\nThe present paper reports the production of bovine monoclonal antibodies to the K99 pilus antigen of non-invasive enterotoxigenic E. coli (K99 + ETEC) using the above fusion and 're-fusion' techniques.\n\nPili production was stimulated by growing E.coli (09,K(A)?, K99) overnight in Minca medium according to the method of Guin~e, Jansen and Agterberg (1976) . Their presence was subsequently confirmed by electron microscopy.\n\nThe pilus antigen was prepared by the method of Altmann, Pyliotis and Mukkur (1982) . Briefly, the E.coli were heated at 6O\u00b0C for 45 min, the suspension blended and the bacteria spun down. The pilus protein was precipitated from the supernatant at pH 4.5 using acetic acid and the precipitate taken up in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2. As the K99 and F41 pilus antigens are frequently co-expressed on bovine K99 + ETEC, the purity of the K99 pilus preparation was confirmed by the fact that 1) on SDS-PAGE a single band of apparent MW 16.5 K was obtained whereas the F41 antigen has a MW of 29.5 K (De Graaf and Roorda, 1982) , 2) the K99 + ETEC did not agglutinate in a specific slide agglutination test with F41 antisera and 3) the K99 + ETEC did not haemagglutinate guinea pig red cells in the presence of mannose (De Graaf and Roorda, 1982) .\n\nOne 18 month old steer (calf 1) was injected on the rump with 14.0 ml The popliteal lymph node was excised from calf 1 on day 3 and from calf 2 on day 4 following the second injection.\n\nFusion partners used were mouse myeloma NSO cells (subline of NS1/1Ag4.1), two non-lg secreting mouse/calf xenohybridomas (53B3 and 54B3) and a bovine IgGl-secreting xenohybridoma (94A1) derived from a 'refusion' of 53B3 (Tucker et al., 1984) .\n\nThe popliteal lymph nodes were chopped in culture medium using a small scalpel. Large lumps of tissue were allowed to settle and lymphocytes in suspension pipetted off and centrifuged and resuspended in culture medium.\n\nLymphocytes were fused with nweloma or xenohybridoma cells at a ratio of 4:1 respectively using 50% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 1500 in RPMI (BDH Chemicals Ltd., Poole, U.K.) by a modification of the method described by McMasters and Williams (1979) . Cells were cultured in 24-well plates (Linbro) and seeded at 1 x 106 cells/ml (2.0 ml per well) in a selective medium composed of RPMI 1640\n\nwith 10 -4 M hypoxanthine, 4 x 10 -7 M aminopterin, 1.6 x 10-3M thymidine (Flow Laboratories, Irvine, Scotland) plus 10% horse serum (HS) as described previously (Tucker et al 1984) . Control wells of unfused fusion partners and lymphocytes were set up in each case. Culture supernatants were removed at 14 days post fusion and replaced with fresh medium.\n\nCells were cloned on soft agar according to the method described by KShler (1979).\n\nA solid phase capture-type enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect anti-K99 bovine immunoglobulins (Ig) present in culture supernatants.\n\nFlat-bottomed 96-well plates (Dynatech, U.K.) were coated overnight with a 1 in 1000 dilution in bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) of rabbit anti-K99 antibody (RAK99) which was used as the capture antibody. This had been absorbed against enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) which, after overnight growth at 18\u00b0C, no longer expressed the K99 antigen (Aft mann et al., 1982) .\n\nAfter washing the plates three times in phosphate buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma Chemical Company Ltd., Poole, Dorset), PBST, a 1 in 100 dilution of the K99 antigen preparation in PBST was added for 1 hour at 32\u00b0C.\n\nThe plates were then washed three times in PBST and the culture supernatants were added and incubated for 2 hours at 32\u00b0C. After three washes in PBST, a 1 in 5000 dilution in PBST of the conjugate was added and left for another hour.\n\nThe conjugate used was alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit antibody specific for bovine heavy and light Ig chains (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Avondale Pennsylvania). The plates were then washed three times in PBST and developed using p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) in diethanolamine (Fisons plc, Loughborough, U.K.) buffer pH 9.8 at 1 mg/ml. Optical densities were read with a multi-skan automatic reader at 405 and 519 nm absorbance.\n\nCulture supernatants were replaced by PBS and culture medium as negative controls. Serum taken from the immunized calf at slaughter was used as a positive control.\n\nSupernatants from cell lines derived from fusions using xenohybridoma 94A1\n\nwere tested for anti-Forssman activity in a standard haemolytic test against sheep red blood cells as described previously (Tucker et al. 1984 ).\n\nImmunoglobulins were precipitated from culture supernatants using a 1:1 volume of 50% saturated ammonium sulphate by the method of Jonak (1980 They have been described in detail previously (Tucker et al. 1984) . NSO was the original mouse myeloma line;\n\n53B3 and 54B3 were non-Ig secreting primary xenohybridomas. 94A1 was a cloned secondary xenohybridoma, derived from a 're-fusion' of 53B3 and secreted a bovine IgG 1 of Forssman specificity.\n\nThe above fusion partners were used in six fusions with lymph node cells from two steers which had been immunized with K99 pilus antigen (Table 1 ).\n\nIn all 6 fusions, distinct hybridoma colonies were visible in all culture plate wells within 7 days after fusion. There was no obvious difference between the fusions in the mean number of colonies per well; in the case of 54B3, the relatively low number of colonies was probably an underestimate as many were in suspension thus making counting difficult. Table 2 shows the percentage of positive clones obtained from each line assayed at approximately 2-3 weeks after cloning. All clones of line D had retained anti-Forssman activity but none was positive for anti-K99. On the other hand, all 96 clones isolated from line E secreted anti-K99.\n\nOne cloned line from A was selected for further study but lost anti-K99 activity after 7 months in culture. A cloned line from C and E was cultured for several weeks and then recloned. 50 clones were tested and 77% of C and 98% of E subclones secreted anti-K99 antibody. One positive subclone each from C and E has maintained secretion of antibody for more than one year in continual passage. The ELISA antibody titres of clone A and subclone C and E supernatants (cell density 2 x 105/ml) were assessed periodically. These were greater than or equal to 512 at 10 weeks post cloning or subcloning. This titre represented an Ig secretion rate of approximately 5-10 ug/lO 6 cells/ml. After over a\n\nyear in continual passage the titre of subclones C and E has dropped to 32.\n\nMetaphase spreads of the xenohybridomas showed the presence of bovine chromosomes. The number of chromosomes in 25 cells from each line was counted and bovine chromosomes distinguished from murine by their clear centromeric regions (Fig. 3) . The number of bovine chromosomes in 53B3, 54B3 and 94A1 agreed with those previously reported (Tucker et al., 1984) , 53B3 (mxc) having 7%, 54B3 (mxc) 8% and 94A1 (mxcxc) 14% bovine chromosomes. Cloned line A (mxc) had 13% bovine chromosomes when counted 2 months after fusion. A feature of the re-cloned hybridomas from C and E (mxcxc and mxcxcxc) was the high proportion of polyploid (4 n) cells; line C had 16% bovine chromosomes (18.57 \u00b1 4.44 in a total of 124.63 \u00b1 13.13 (4n)) and line E 18-19.5% bovine chromosomes (26.13 \u00b1 4.47 in a total 134.33 \u00b1 7.23 (4n) and 14.33 \u00b1 2.74 in a total of 78.0 \u00b1 8.14 (2n)). \n\nConcentrated supernatants from lines A, C and E were shown to be of IgG 1 isotype by immunodiffusion tests.\n\nThe class was confirmed by autoradiography on SDS PAGE gels (Fig.4) .\n\nFusion partners NSO, 53B3 and 54B3 showed no Ig chains, whereas 94A1 had a distinct y chain but only a faint light chain. Differences in MW were apparent between individual light and heavy chains.\n\nCulture supernatants from A, C and E were tested by ELISA against K88, CFA I, CFA II, g87P and CP pilus antigens. They showed no cross-reactivity.\n\nCulture supernatants from lines A, C and E inhibited the agglutination of horse red cells by K99 + ETEC. Culture medium alone and supernatants from cultures that had ceased to produce anti-K99 antibody did not inhibit agglutination.\n\nUsing an FITC labelled rabbit anti-bovine IgG second antibody, supernatants from lines A, C and E were shown to bind to K99 + ETEC. Control samples showed no fluorescence. Supernatants from lines A, C and E inhibited adhesion of K99 + ZTEC to piglet enterocytes. Control samples did not inhibit (Fig. 5) .\n\nAutoradiograph of SDS-PAGE of 14C-labelled Ig chains in culture supernatants. Fusion partners NSO, 53B3 and 54B3 showed no evidence of Ig chain secretion (b-d) whereas 94A1 showed a y chain and a very weak light chain (e).\n\nThe anti-K99 secreting lines A and E show evidence of y and light chain secretion (k-l).\n\nControls include mouse monoclonal IgG and M (a & i respectively), bovine monoclonal IgG I (f,h,n), bovine monoclonal IgG~ (m) and bovine monoclonal IgM (g).\n\nSbpernatant from a non-secreting sec6ndary mouse/bovine hybridoma is also included (j). Preliminary experiments with murine/ovine hybridomas indicated that the use of such xenohybridomas might offer a feasible approach for the production of ruminant monoclonal antibodies (Tucker, Dain, Wright and Clarke, 1981) .\n\nThe first reports of the production of monoclonal bovine immunoglobulins by primary xenohybridomas were by Srikumaran et al (1983 Srikumaran et al ( , 1984 . However, these were of unknown specificity. Raybould et al. 1985 used this technique to produce a bovine monoclonal antibody to bovine enteric coronavirus; this line was stable for at least 3 months. Tucker et al, 1984 reported the production of a bovine monoclonal antibody to sheep red cells (anti-Forssman) using a xenohybridoma fusion partner. This line has been secreting antibody for over three years in almost continual culture.\n\nThe initial reasoning behind the use of xenohybridomas rather than mouse myeloma cells as fusion partners was that they might retain more bovine chromosomes on re-fusion, thereby increasing the chances of retaining the chromosomes relevant for Ig production (Tucker et al 1984) .\n\nThe present results substantiate this hypothesis in that the use of xenohybridomas as fusion partners resulted in stable lines with an increased proportion of bovine: mouse chromosomes (from 8% to 15% bovine chromosomes in line C and from 14% to 18 and 20% in line E). The cloned line derived from NSO retained 13% bovine chromosomes and this may be the reason this particular clone was able to maintain antibody secretion for as long as 7 months, before ceasing production. Further chromosomal analysis on more lines will have to be carried out before firm conclusions can be drawn and this will involve identification of individual bovine chromosomes. Earlier results using xenohybridomas indicated that the loci for Ig chain production may be on chromosomes 12 and 22\n\nin the bovine (Tucker et al. 1984) ; further studies of these lines may help to confirm this assignment.\n\nReports of the use of mouse x human hybridomas as fusion partners to produce human monoclonal antibodies have had conflicting results (Teng, Lam, Piera and Kaplan 1983; Ostberg and Pusch, 1983; Murphy, Webb, Earle, Russ, Churcher, Tait and D'Aspice, 1986) . The latter showed that the failure of primary mouse x human fusions was largely due to a higher death rate of xenohybrids. This was certainly not the case in our studies where primary xenohybridomas often showed just as prolific a growth as mouse x mouse hybridomas. Murphy et al. (1986) , also found that secondary xenohybrids continued to survive although they ceased immunoglobulin synthesis. They therefore concluded that this was 'a step in the right direction' towards production of stable lines secreting human monoclonal antibodies. Another factor in assessing stability of the hybridoma lines is the number of times it is necessary to reclone. Raybould et al (1985) cloned only once whereas Srikumaran et al (1983 Srikumaran et al ( ,1984 carried out three early clonings. In our general experience with xenohybridomas it is advantageous to clone as soon as possible after positive colonies have been identified; subsequent further clonings may be necessary, but this will vary from clone to clone.\n\nThe subunit composition of the K99 pilus antigen has been the subject of much debate (reviewed Parry and Rooke, 1984) . In particular, the question has been raised as to whether or not the haemagglutinin and adhesin on the pilus are on separate sub-units. The fact that the pilus preparation used as the immunogen in the present study gave a single band on SDS-PAGE (approximately MW 16.5 K) and gave rise to monoclonal antibodies that inhibited both adhesion and haemagglutination probably indicates that the molecules on the K99 pilus antigen involved in adhesion and haemagglutination are identical or similar.\n\nThe monoclonal antibodies should provide useful tools for further studies of the epitopes and receptors involved in the etiology of E. coli infections.\n\nFurthermore, the production of homologous monoclonal bovine anti-idiotypic antibodies now becomes possible.\n\nThe murine/bovine hybridoma technique described here offers considerable potential for the development of other monoclonal antibodies relevant to the field of veterinary science. To date, using this technique we have produced lines secreting bovine monoclonal antibodies (IgG1, IgG 2, or IgM) to bovine red cell alloantigens, (Tucker, M~t~nier and Clarke, 1987) as well as to other bovine pathogens."}
