{"title": "The Influence Of Social Behavior On Competition Between Virulent Pathogen Strains 2", "body": "a model without adaptive social behaviour as well as a model that includes it, and in the following Results 90 section we will compare their dynamics. 91 3 Model 92 We compare dynamics of a two-strain compartmental epidemic model in the presence and absence of adaptive 93 social behaviour. Individuals are born susceptible (S). They may be infected either by a resident strain (I 1 ) 94 or a mutant strain (I 2 ). For simplicity, we assume that co-infection and super-infection are not possible. 95 Infected individuals can either recover (R) or die from infection. We furthermore assume that recovery from 96 either strain offers permanent immunity to both strains. The system of differential equations representing 97 the SI 1 I 2 R model in the absence of adaptive social behaviour (we will refer to this as the \"uncoupled model\" 98 throughout) is given by\n\nwhere \u03b2 1 (\u03b2 2 ) represents the transmission rate of the resident (mutant) strain; \u03b3 1 (\u03b3 2 ) represents the recovery 100 rate from the resident (mutant) strain; \u03bd 1 (\u03bd 2 ) represents the death rate from the resident (mutant) strain that individuals respond to the total number of severe cases \u03c9 1 I 1 + \u03c9 2 I 2 they observe at a given time.\n\nPreventive behaviour is not always completely effective. We introduce efficacy of infection control 1 ( 2 ) 115 against the resident (mutant) strain. The efficacy of infection control influences the transmission process. 116 The more effective infection control is against a strain, the less likely it will be transmitted.\n\nMore formally, the preceding imitation dynamic (or equivalently, replicator dynamic) assumes that each 118 individual samples others as a fixed rate, and if another person is found to be playing a different strategy 119 but is receiving a higher payoff, the individual switches to their strategy with a probability proportional 120 to the expected gain in payoff [36] . These assumptions give rise to a differential equation of the form 121 dx/dt = kx(1 \u2212 x)\u2206U where k is the sampling rate and \u2206U is the payoff difference between the two 122 strategies. This equation is derived elsewhere and is used in other socio-ecological and socio-epidemiological 123 models [35, 37, 38, 39 ]. The augmented system of differential equations representing the coupled social-124 epidemiological SI 1 I 2 RX model with adaptive human behaviour is therefore given by:\n\n(2)\n\nWe apply the restrictions i \u2208 [0, 1] and \u03c9 i \u2265 0.\n\nBaseline parameter values are summarized in Table 1 \n\nR 0,1 (resp. R 0,2 ) is the basic reproductive number of the resident (mutant) strain, where R 0,i is given by\n\nThe other two equilibria are endemic. Assuming that basic reproductive numbers are not equal, strains can 145 not co-exist and the strain with the higher basic reproductive number always invades. The analytical expression and stability criteria for the equilibrium with co-existing strains are difficult to 151 compute and therefore, we analyze it numerically.\n\nIf both basic reproductive numbers are less than 1, then the system is disease-free and social behaviour is not relevant. Assume, on the other hand, that 1 < R 0,2 < R 0,1 (as in our baseline parameter values, Table   1 , and where the expressions for R 0,1 and R 0,2 are the same as in the SI 1 I 2 R model and assume x = 0.\n\nThis corresponds to a scenario where the resident strain is more transmissible than the mutant strain. As already noted the mutant strain can not invade in the absence of adaptive social behaviour (SI 1 I 2 R model).\n\nHowever, in the presence of adaptive social behaviour, we can derive necessary and sufficient conditions for 6 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/293936 doi: bioRxiv preprint the mutant strain to invade when 1 < R 0,2 < R 0,1 :\n\nThese results show that a high level of perceived severity from the mutant strain is a necessary condition 153 for invasion. However, it has to be coupled with a sufficiently high efficacy of infection control against the 154 resident strain (with 1 > 2 ). A high efficacy of infection control against the resident strain will effectively 155 reduce its transmission and therefore creating a larger pool of susceptible individuals for the mutant strain.\n\nThe two conditions must be met simultaneously to provide a necessary and sufficient condition for invasion.\n\nThe condition that 1 > 2 could easily be met in a real population if the two strains differ in their model 158 of transmission, and the population has more experience with controlling the resident strain than with the 159 new mutant strain. Moreover, a high value of \u03c9 2 could easily be met in a real population due to spreading 160 panic about a new and more virulent strain that public health does not yet know how to best control. 161 We also consider necessary and sufficient conditions for failure of invasion of the mutant strain:\n\nInvasion fails when perceived severity of the mutant strain is low enough but also that of the resident strain jointly. Together, they create a necessary and sufficient condition for the failure of invasion.\n\nFinally assume that R 0,1 < R 0,2 (this scenario is not discussed at length in this paper). In the absence 167 of social behaviour, the mutant strain is bound to invade. However, we derive necessary and sufficient 168 conditions for the failure of invasion when social behaviour is added to the system:\n\ntogether they provide necessary and sufficient condition for the mutant strain to fail invasion.\n\nWe finally turn our attention to the invasion of the mutant strain when it is more transmissible. The 177 invasion is conditional: necessary and sufficient conditions for the invasion of the mutant strain are:\n\n178\n\nIn this scenario, a low perceived severity of the resident strain will allow invasion of the mutant strain 179 provided that the efficacy of infection control against the resident strain is high enough. insight into the types of dynamics exhibited by the model. 194 We first consider a scenario where the mutant strain, on account of its greater virulence, is perceived to 195 be ten times more severe than the resident strain (\u03c9 2 = 10 5 = 10\u03c9 1 ). Moreover, infection control against the .\n\nIt is difficult for both strains to co-exist without imposing \u03c9 1 = 10 5 > \u03c9 2 = 10 4 . If the resident strain 216 is perceived to be ten times more severe, then co-existence is achieved via a transient but very long-term 217 pattern of switching between oscillatory regimes before the system finally converges to an equilibrium of 218 co-existence (Fig 1g) . The system switches between a longer-lived regime with relatively small epidemics of rate which in turns leads to rapid changes in x. Figure 1h shows the same dynamics as in Figure 1g but on 226 a shorter timescale. 227 We also allowed the perceived severities to be equally high (\u03c9 1 = \u03c9 2 = 10 4 ) and we have increased the 228 efficacies from their baseline values ( 1 = 0.9 and 2 = 0.6) (Figure 1i ). We observe that the mutant strain 229 fails to invade and the prevalence of the resident strain remains relatively close to the initial condition.\n\nIn order to refine our understanding of the influence of social parameters on the invasion of the mutant 231 strain, we proceed in the next subsection with phase plane analysis that studies the interplay between the 232 parameters determining regions of invasion.

This occurs across a nontrivial portion of parameter space 236 despite the fact that R 0,2 < R 0,1 . This regime shift occurs because a sufficiently high perceived severity ( 2 ) can allow the mutant strain to invade (Figure 2e-f) . We note again that, surprisingly, invasion can result 252 in the elimination of the resident strain if the perceived severity of the mutant strain is significantly higher 253 than that of the resident strain (\u03c9 2 >> \u03c9 1 ), but when the opposite applies, coexistence results. We have showed how adaptive social behaviour greatly impacts the evolution of virulence in a coupled 256 behaviour-disease model. If we neglect social behaviour, the basic reproductive numbers of the two strains 257 are sufficient to predict which of the strains will invade a population. However, adding adaptive social 258 behaviour with asymmetric stimulation and effects on either strain to an epidemiological system completely 259 shifts how we view whether a more virulent strain will be selected for. As we have seen, social behaviour \n\nWhile the model discussed in this paper serves as a general framework for studying the influence of social 285 behaviour on strain competition and emergence, further research needs to be carried out to understand the 286 interplay between the epidemiological and social parameters. For instance, we did not model virulence evo-287 lution explicitly but rather by assuming two strains have already emerged due to mutation and addressing 288 conditions under which the more virulent mutant strain is more fit. Future research could instead model 289 virulence by defining transmission and recovery rates in terms of a virulence parameter, or by using an 290 adaptive dynamics approach. Future research could also explore different possible relationships between the 291 virulence parameters \u03bd 1,2 and the perceived severity parameters \u03c9 1,2 , or the interaction between social learn-292 ing timescales and pathogen evolutionary timescales. We did not study the influence of the social learning 293 parameter \u03ba in this paper, but previous research on other socio-ecological and socio-epidemiological systems 294 suggests that the social learning rate can destabilize interior equilibria [39, 38] . A model that accounts 295 for multiple rounds of mutation would enable studying how pathogen evolutionary timescales interact with 296 11 .

Finally, we assumed no specific relationship between the perceived severity \u03c9 1,2 and the virulence \u03bd 1,2 although a non-trivial relationship certainly exists, and future research could explore 298 possible assumptions for their formal relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, our model shows how social behaviour can influence the virulence of emerging strains 300 under plausible parameter regimes when using standard models for social and infection dynamics. When 301 analyzing emerging and re-emerging pathogens and continually evolving infectious diseases such as influenza, 302 it is worthwhile further considering aspects of social behaviour in efforts to mitigate serious threats. x(t)\n\nx(t)\n\nx(t)\n\nx(t)\n\nx(t)\n\nx(t)\n\nx(t)\n\nx(t)\n\nx(t) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. w1=10 2 , w2=10 2 w1=10 6 , w2=10 8 w1=10 6 , w2=10 2 Figure 2 : Parameter plane analysis of the SI 1 I 2 RX model. These dynamics are more complex than those exhibited by the SI 1 I 2 R model, which only predicts persistence of strain 1 for equivalent parameter values. The epidemiological parameters are at baseline values ( Table 1 ). The social parameters are varied. (a) and (d) show no invasion of the mutant strain when 1 = 0.2 and 2 = 0.1 in the \u03c9 1 \u2212 \u03c9 2 parameter plane (a) and when \u03c9 1 = \u03c9 2 = 10 2 in the 1 \u2212 2 parameter plane (d). (b) and (c) represent similar qualitative results when for large 1 = 0.9 we get invasion of the mutant strain in the black region and co-existence with the resident strain in the red region. The invasion region is bigger when 2 is lower ( 2 = 0.1 in (b) and 2 = 0.6 in (c) ). Finally, in (e) and (f ) we observe qualitatively different results when we vary \u03c9 2 in the 1 \u2212 2 parameter plane. In (e) , 10 8 = \u03c9 2 > \u03c9 1 , we have invasion of the mutant strain. In (f ) , \u03c9 1 = 10 6 > \u03c9 2 , we have co-existence of the strains. The light gray region in the lower-left hand corner of subpanel (b) corresponds to both strains being extinct."}
