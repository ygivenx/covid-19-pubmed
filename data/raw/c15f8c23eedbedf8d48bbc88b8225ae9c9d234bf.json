{"title": "Crystal structure of Nsp15 endoribonuclease NendoU from SARS-CoV-2 Running Title: Structure of Nsp15 from SARS-CoV-2", "body": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an etiologic agent responsible for the current outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 . Over the past two months, the pathogen has infected over 88,000 people and caused at least 3,000 deaths. As we were preparing this report the numbers have doubled. Although currently mainly concentrated in China, the virus is spreading worldwide rapidly and is found in 64 countries and all continents (www.trackcorona.live). Millions of people are being quarantined and the epidemics impacts the world economy. There is no existing vaccine or proven drug for this disease, but various treatment options, for example utilizing medicines effective in other viral ailments, are being attempted.\n\nCoronaviruses are enveloped, non-segmented positive-sense RNA viruses from the order nidoviruses that have the largest genome among RNA viruses. The genome contains a large replicase gene encompassing nonstructural proteins (Nsps), followed by structural and accessory genes. Due to ribosomal frameshifting, the replicase gene encodes two ORFs, rep1a and rep1b, that are translated into two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab (Cui et al., 2019) . These polypeptides are processed by two viral proteases: 3C-like protease (3CLpro, encoded by Nsp5), and papain-like protease (PLP, encoded within Nsp3). The cleavage yields 16 viral Nsps (Baez-Santos et al., 2015) that assemble into a large membrane-bound replicase complex and exhibits multiple enzymatic activities. While several functions of Nsps have been linked to RNA replication and processing of subgenomic RNAs, the roles of some proteins are poorly understood or remain unknown.\n\nOne of such enigmatic enzymes, corresponding to Nsp15, is a nidoviral RNA uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) carrying C-terminal catalytic domain belonging to the EndoU family.\n\nEndoU enzymes are present in all kingdoms of life, where they play various biological functions associated with RNA processing. All characterized family members display an RNA endonuclease activity producing 2'-3' cyclic phosphodiester and 5\u00b4-hydroxyl termini (Ulferts & Ziebuhr, 2011) .\n\nThe viral and eukaryotic enzymes act on both, single-and double stranded RNA and are specific for uridine. The prototypic member of the family was discovered in Xenopus laevis, and thus named XendoU, where it is associated with maturation of intron-encoded small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA) (Caffarelli et al., 1994 , Caffarelli et al., 1997 , Gioia et al., 2005 , Laneve et al., 2003 . The human homolog, placental protein 11 (PP11, HendoU) plays yet an unknown role in the placental tissue (Laneve et al., 2008) , but is also expressed in cancer cells. In Drosophila, DendoU has been found to be relevant for nervous system physiology and pathology (Laneve et al., 2017) . The EndoU . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

While initially Nsp15 was thought to directly participate in viral replication, it was later shown that Nsp15-deficient coronaviruses were viable and replicating, rising doubts about the enzyme role in that process. More recently, it was proposed that NendoU activity of Nsp15 is responsible for the protein interference with the innate immune response (Deng et al., 2017) though other studies indicate that the process is independent of the endonuclease activity (Liu et al., 2019) .\n\nNevertheless, Nsp15 is essential in coronavirus biology.\n\nNsp15s from coronaviruses share little sequence similarity with their arteriviruses counterpart Nsp11: the SARS-CoV Nsp15 has only 22% identical residues with Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus (PRRSV) Nsp11. Within arteriviruses alone sequence conservation of Nsp11 is generally low, while Nsp15 of coronaviruses are more conserved, with the current SARS-CoV-2 sharing 88% sequence identity and 95% similarity with its known closest homolog from SARS-CoV. Nsp15 from Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is more distant, with ~50% sequence identity and ~65% similarity and H-CoV-229E being even more distant with 43% sequence identity and 56% similarity.\n\nAfter the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak there was an increased interest in virus-encoded endoribonucleases. The first two structures of Nsp15 were determined from Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) (PDB id 2GTH, 2GTI (Xu et al., 2006) ) and SARS coronavirus (PDB id 2H85, (Ricagno et al., 2006) . Currently, there are in total eight structures available for Nsp15 including additional two from SARS-CoV (PDB ids: 2OZK, 2RHB, (Joseph et al., 2007) ), one from MERS-CoV (PDB id 5YVD, (Zhang et al., 2018) ) and two from human coronavirus H-CoV-229E (PDB ids 4S1T, 4RS4, (Huo & Liu, 2015) ). Among Nsp11 endoribonucleases, there are two structures determined of PRRSV (Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus) (PDB ids 5EYI, 5DA1, (Zhang et al., 2017) ), and two for EAV (Equine Arteritis Virus, PDB ids 5HC1, 5HBZ, (Zhang et al., 2017) ).\n\nThe structural studies of SARS-and MERS-CoV Nsp15s showed that the protein forms hexamers made of dimers of trimers. The 39 kDa monomeric unit, composed of ~345 residues, folds into three domains: N-terminal, middle domain and C-terminal catalytic NendoU domain.\n\n.

The proteins of the coronavirus are mutating, although not very fast, but these changes may contribute to the virus virulence. Here, we report the first crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 at 2.20 \u00c5 resolution. The Nsp15 structure is very similar to the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV but it shows some differences that may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 virulence.\n\nWe have used synthetic gene of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus nsp15, which was codon optimized for expression in E. coli, to produce soluble protein. Nsp15 was purified and crystallized exercising the well-established structural genomics pipeline. The structure was determined by molecular replacement and refined to 2.20 \u00c5 resolution, as described in Materials and Methods and Table 1 .\n\nThe entire process from protein expression to structure deposition to PDB took 5 days.\n\nThe structure of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus Nsp15 is of good quality and it refined to crystallographic R work of 15.8% and R free of 17.8%. The asymmetric unit contains two monomers of the Nsp15 protein. The electron density map is of high quality throughout the structure and the model covers the sequence from M1 to Q347. Currently, this is the most complete and the highest resolution structure of coronavirus Nsp15. 346 water molecules, eight glycerol molecules, three acetate ions, one magnesium and one chloride ion were identified in the electron density maps.\n\nThe structure of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 monomer is very similar to other Nsp15s from coronaviruses ( Fig. 1 and 2 ). It features three distinct domains. The N-terminal domain is composed of an antiparallel b-sheet (strands b1, b2, and b3) wrapped around two a-helices (a1 and a2). The subsequent middle domain is formed by 10 b-strands organized in three b-hairpins (b5-b6, b7-b8, b12-b13), a mixed b-sheet (b4, b9, b10, b11, b14, b15) and three short helices, two a and one 3 10 (a3, h4, and a5). The C-terminal catalytic NendoU domain contains two antiparallel b-sheets (b16-. CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

The concave surface of the bsheets is flanked by five a-helices (a6, a7, a8, a9, a10).\n\nAs expected from high sequence identity (Fig. 3) , the structure aligns best with SARS-CoV Nsp15 (0.47 \u00c5 RMSD of chain A with PDB id: 2H85, chain A; sequence identity 88%), and also shows good agreement with Nsp15 from MERS-CoV (1.17 \u00c5 RMSD of chain A with PDB id 5YVD, chain A; sequence identity 51%). The structural homology is not only observed in positions of a-helices and b-strands but surprisingly in several loop regions (for example the conformation of loop L1 (F16 -P24) is virtually identical in all three proteins). But there are some interesting differences between SARS-and MERS-CoVs proteins in loop regions (b8-b9, b10-b11) with the largest (more than 5 \u00c5) centering on the loop between strand b13 and b14 where MERS-CoV Nsp15 has three-residues insertion. These relatively small changes in the subunit structures translate into larger shifts in the hexamer (see below).\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 NendoU monomers assemble into a double-ring hexamer, generated by a dimer of trimers (Fig. 4) . This is in agreement with PISA calculations, estimating trimers to be a stable form of the enzyme, and the previous experimental work capturing SARS-CoV Nsp15 trimeric intermediates (Guarino et al., 2005) . It has been shown that hexamer is essential for the enzymatic activity. A ~100 \u00c5 long and narrow (10-15 \u00c5 diameter) channel runs down the 3-fold axis. This channel is accessible to solvent from the top, bottom and also through three side openings in the middle of hexamer. The hexamer is stabilized by the interactions of N-terminal oligomerization domains, but also each subunit domain contributes to oligomer interface. As a result, monomers interact extensively with all five other subunits of the hexamer, making the hexamer potentially very sensitive to mutations that can disrupt oligomeric assembly (Fig. 4) . The middle domains are the most transposed out in the hexamer creating the concave surfaces that may serve as an interaction hubs. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.02.968388 doi: bioRxiv preprint of the middle domain. This suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 enzyme operates most likely a manner very similar to SARS-CoV, H-CoV-229E and MERS CoV homologs, though it still may display different catalytic properties and potentially altered substrate specificity.\n\nRecombinant Nsp15s were shown to have Mn +2 -dependent endoribonuclease activity that cut double-stranded (ds) RNA substrates with specificity towards uridylate in unpaired regions (Bhardwaj et al., 2004 , Bhardwaj et al., 2008 , Bhardwaj et al., 2006 , Ivanov et al., 2004 . While the early work suggested cleavage upstream and downstream of U (Bhardwaj et al., 2004 , Ivanov et al., 2004 , the 2006 more detailed study demonstrated the reaction occurs on the 3' end of U (Bhardwaj et al., 2006) . The enzyme carries out transesterification reaction releasing 2'-3'cyclic phosphate end (Ivanov et al., 2004) , as has been demonstrated for other members of EndoU family (Nedialkova et al., 2009 , Renzi et al., 2006 , though some studies report subsequent hydrolysis of the cyclic compound (Nedialkova et al., 2009) .\n\nThe catalytic function of Nsp15 resides in the C-terminal NendoU domain. The active site, located in a shallow groove between the two b-sheets, carries six key residues conserved among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV proteins: His235, His250, Lys290, Thr341, Tyr343, and Ser294 (Fig.   5 ). The main chain architecture of this region as well as side chain conformations of the active site residues (with exception of Lys290) are conserved between all three proteins. The two histidine residues are contributed by the helical layer of the domain, while pairs lysine/serine and threonine/tyrosine originate from two b-strands representing edges of the b-sheets. His235, His250, Lys290 have been proposed to constitute the catalytic triad, based on the similarity of their mutual arrangement to the active site of ribonuclease A (Ricagno et al., 2006) . In this scenario, His235 plays a role of the general acid while His250 acts a base. By the same reasoning, Ser294 together with Tyr343 are believed to govern U specificity, resembling the roles of Phe120 and Thr45 (the B1 subsite specific for pyrimidine base) in RNAse A in base recognition (delCardayre & Raines, 1994) .\n\nSpecifically, Ser294 analogs have been proposed to interact with the carbonyl oxygen atom O2 of uracil via the main chain nitrogen atom, while the hydroxyl group would bind to the nitrogen atom ((Bhardwaj et al., 2004 , Bhardwaj et al., 2008 , Bhardwaj et al., 2006 , Ivanov et al., 2004 . Notably though, not all mutational data support the hypothesis of the discriminatory role of Ser and, as an . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

However, the metal binding site was never located, though it is important to note that there is no structure of the protein/RNA complex. In our structure, there are two subunits in the asymmetric unit. One of them has an electron density peak near the active site that may correspond to metal ion and we tentatively modeled it as a magnesium ion, although the coordination sphere is poor. The metal ion is coordinated by oxygen atom of carboxylate Asp283 (2.61 \u00c5), hydroxyl group of Ser262\n\n(2.08 \u00c5) and main chain carbonyl oxygen atom of Pro263 (2.28 \u00c5). Nearby, there is a side chain of Arg258. If this would be a manganese ion, this arginine could coordinate the metal ion using nitrogen of guanidinium moiety (distance to magnesium ion is 4.1 \u00c5). These residues are conserved in SARS but not in MERS enzymes. We propose that this is the metal binding site required for maintaining conformation of the active site and substrate during catalysis.\n\nIn the hexameric context, the active sites are located on the top and bottom of the assembly.\n\nNendoU binds single and double stranded RNA and large substrate can access these six sites from a site of the hexamer. All six sites can be occupied simultaneously. Due to extensive interactions between protein subunits, there is possibility for cooperativity or anti-cooperativity between binding sites. By analogy to SARS-CoV Nsp15 and SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15, the hexamer most likely represents an active form of the enzyme.\n\nWe have determined the high-resolution crystal structure of endoribonuclease NendoU from SARS-CoV-2. The structure is homologous to SARS-and MERS-CoVs Nsp15s and shows a hexamer, the functionally active form of the endoribonuclease. The active site residues are conserved both in terms of sequence and conformation. The structural comparisons suggest that inhibitors of SARS-CoV Nsp15 have good chance to inhibit also the SARS-CoV-2 homolog but inhibitors of MERS-CoV NendoU are unlikely to inhibit the enzyme.\n\n.

Briefly, the gene for Nsp15 SARS-CoV-2 was optimized for E. coli expression using the OptimumGene codon optimization algorithm followed by manual editing and then synthesized cloned directly into pMCSG53 vector (Twist Bioscience). The plasmid was transformed into the E. coli BL21(DE3)-Gold strain (Stratagene). For large-scale purification of the protein, a 4 L culture of LB Lennox medium was grown at 37\u00b0C (190 rpm) in presence of ampicillin 150 \u00b5g/ml. Once the culture reached OD 600 ~1.0, the temperature setting was changed to 4\u00b0C. When bacterial suspension cooled down to 18\u00b0C it was supplemented with the following components to indicated concentration: 0.2 mM IPTG, 0.1% glucose, 40mM K 2 HPO 4 . The temperature was set to 18\u00b0C for 20 hours incubation. Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7,000g and cell pellets were resuspended in a 12.5 ml lysis buffer (500 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 20 mM imidazole and 10 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol) per liter culture and sonicated at 120W for 5 minutes (4 sec ON, 20 sec OFF). The cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 30,000g for one hour at 4\u00b0C. Supernatant was mixed with 4 ml of Ni 2+ Sepharose (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) equilibrated with lysis buffer supplemented to 50 mM imidazole pH 8.0 and suspension was applied on Flex-Column (420400-2510) connected to Vac-Man vacuum manifold (Promega). Unbound proteins were washed out via controlled suction with 160 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM imidazole).\n\nBound proteins were eluted with 20 ml of lysis buffer supplemented to 500 mM imidazole pH 8.0. 2 mM DTT was added followed by Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease treatment at 1:20 protease:protein ratio. The solution was left at 4\u00b0C overnight. Unfortunately, for this particular construct, TEV protease was not able to cleave off the His tag. Nsp15 was successfully separated from TEV protease on Superdex 200 column equilibrated in lysis buffer where 10 mM \u03b2mercaptoethanol was replaced by 1 mM TCEP. Fractions containing Nsp15 were collected. Lysis buffer was replaced on 30 kDa MWCO filter (Amicon-Millipore) via 10X concentration/dilution repeated 3 times to crystallization buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1 mM TCEP). Final concentration of Nsp15 was 36 mg/ml.

The sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method was used with the help of the Mosquito liquid dispenser (TTP LabTech) in 96-well CrystalQuick plates (Greiner Bio-One). Crystallizations were performed with the protein-to-matrix ratio of 1:1. MCSG4 (Anatrace), SaltRX (Hampton) and INDEX (Hampton) screens were used for protein crystallization at 16\u00b0C. The best conditions were MCSG4 H11 (0.2 M calcium acetate, 0.1 M HEPES/NaOH pH 7.5, 10% PEG 8000). Diffractionquality crystals of Nsp15 suitable for data collection appeared after 12 hours.\n\nPrior to data collection at 100 K, all cryoprotected crystals of Nsp15 were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. The x-ray diffraction experiments were carried out at the Structural Biology Center 19-ID beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. The diffraction images were recorded on the PILATUS3 6M detector K using 0.5\u00b0 rotation and 0.5 sec exposure for 100\u00b0. The data set was processed and scaled with the HKL3000 suite (Minor et al., 2006) . Intensities were converted to structure factor amplitudes in the Ctruncate program (French & Wilson, 1978 , Padilla & Yeates, 2003 from the CCP4 package (Winn et al., 2011) . The structure was determined using molrep (Vagin & Teplyakov, 2010) implemented in the HKL3000 software package and SARS-CoV Nsp15 structure (PDB id 2H85) as a search model. The initial solution was manually adjusted using COOT (Emsley & Cowtan, 2004) and then iteratively refined using COOT, PHENIX (Adams et al., 2010) and REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997 , Winn et al., 2011 . Initially REFMAC refinement worked better for the structure which was subsequently moved to PHENIX to finalize the refinement.\n\nThroughout the refinement, the same 5% of reflections were kept out throughout from the refinement (in both REFMAC and PHENIX refinement). The final structure converged to a good R work = 0.158 and R free = 0.178 with regards to data quality. The stereochemistry of the structure was checked with PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) and the Ramachandran plot and validated with the PDB validation server. The data collection and processing statistics are given in Table 1 . The atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 6VWW. As we were preparing this report we have determined and deposited to PDB higher resolution 1.90 \u00c5 structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 in complex with citrate (PDB id 6W01). This .
