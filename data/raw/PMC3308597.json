{"title": "Establishment of Epstein-Barr Virus Growth-transformed Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines", "body": "Note that Step 4, performed to predict successful outcome, is an optional step. If Step 4 is to be performed, you will need to incubate an additional flask of un-infected PBMC at 2 x 106 cells/ml as control.\n\nSuccessful outcome is predicted by the presence of CD23hiCD58+ cells. Approximately 2-3% of live cells on day 3-4 after exposure to EBV should have this profile (Figure 2C). Other sub-populations of CD23+, CD23-, CD58+, and CD58- cells observed after exposure to EBV show minimal proliferation14. Un-infected cells (Figure 2A) and cells exposed to EBV from HH514-16 cells (Figure 2B), harboring a non-immortalizing strain of EBV, do not demonstrate CD23hiCD58+cells.\n\nYou may also visualize cells by light microscopy to monitor successful outcome: As mentioned earlier, within a week after EBV infection, small clusters of cells in the flask are visible by light microscopy (Figure 3B). As time progresses and cells develop into LCL, microscopic clusters become larger (Figure 3C) such that clumps are visible macroscopically in the flask.\n\nFigure 1. Workflow for generation and cryopreservation of lymphoblastoid cell lines. Peripheral blood is centrifuged through a Ficoll gradient. PBMC present in the buffy coat of an established gradient are exposed to FK506 followed by addition of EBV. EBV-exposed cells are grown at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO2 to establish and subsequently expand LCL for cryopreservation.\n\nFigure 2. Identification of a sub-population of B cells expected to undergo proliferation after exposure to EBV. Un-infected PBMC (A) or PBMC exposed to EBV derived from HH514-16 cells (B) or from B95-8 cells (C) in the presence of FK506 were harvested on day 3. Cells were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies directed against CD19, CD23, and CD58. After gating on live cells, un-infected (A) and EBV-exposed (B and C) CD19+ B cells were examined for expression of CD23 and CD58. A sub-population of B cells expressing CD58 and high levels of CD23 (CD23hiCD58+), observed only in the cells exposed to transformation competent EBV (derived from B95-8 cells), is depicted.\n\nFigure 3. Visualization of cell clusters in EBV-infected cells. PBMC were treated with FK506 and infected with EBV. Un-infected (A) and EBV-exposed (B) cells were examined one week post-infection by phase contrast microscopy (10X magnification). Five-week old lymphoblastoid cell line is shown in C.\n\nThe method described in this paper generates LCL from donor peripheral blood with rapid immortalization and cryopreservation times. Through the use of FK506, a T cell immunosuppressant, and high titers of infectious virus we are able to promote proliferation of EBV-infected B cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These interventions make the described method more efficient, resulting in rapid expansion of cells for subsequent experiments. \n\nTraditionally, growth transformation has been monitored by visualization of clusters of cells by light microscopy about a week after exposure to EBV6, 15. However, clustering of cells is not a specific indicator of EBV-mediated growth transformation. We have previously demonstrated consistent identification of the proliferating cell population via flow cytometry14, providing an accurate and specific method to determine successful outcome as early as three days after exposure of B cells to EBV. \n\nNo conflicts of interest declared."}
