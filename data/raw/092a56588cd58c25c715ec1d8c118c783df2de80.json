{"title": "Antibody Fragment Expression and Purification", "body": "Interest in the potential of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as therapeutic agents has surged in the past decade. Currently, however, the main therapeutic targets of antibodies remain cancer and autoimmune diseases (1, 2) and only one antibody targeting viral infection, Synagis (palivizumab), has been approved by FDA for prophylaxis against respiratory syncytial virus (3) . Recently, potent neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies have been selected against the emerging paramyxoviruses Hendra virus and Nipah virus (4) which are now being evaluated in vivo for efficacy in a ferret model. Newly discovered human mAbs against the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) have been developed which target highly conserved epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein and have not demonstrated any affinity to human proteins or lipids (5) . In addition, humanized or fully human mAbs have been selected against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) (6) and West Nile virus (7), among others (8) . Perhaps among the most significant advances in facilitating the development of specific antiviral mAbs has been the implementation of bacterial phage display platforms using combinatorial antibody libraries (9, 10) . Such phage libraries can be prepared to encode human antibodies as fragment antibodies (Fabs) containing the light chain and the first two domains of the heavy chain. To meet increasing research needs, the implementation of new methods for expressing and purifying these recombinant antibodies is of primary importance to facilitate their efficient production while decreasing production costs.\n\nThe recombinant antibody production methods usually consist of three major steps: transformation, expression, and purification. In the transformation step, plasmid DNA coding for a His-tagged Fab is transformed into HB2151 bacterial cells, and successfully transformed cells are selected using ampicillin. During this step, Fab expression is suppressed by a high glucose concentration in the medium. In the next step, isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) in the absence of glucose is used to induce Fab expression. In the purification step, Polymyxin B is used to release the Fab from the bacterial periplasm. Finally, Ni-NTA affinity chromatography is used to specifically purify the His-tagged Fab. In addition to the use of such mAbs as antivirals, these Fabs can serve as important tools as specific detection reagents in various other techniques, such as enzymelinked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), Western blots, immunoprecipitation, and flow cytometry analysis.\n\nFor research purposes it is often convenient to express and purify these Fabs in smaller amounts. However, quite often the quantities of these Fabs are insufficient for other purposes and there is necessity of rapid methods for their expression and purification. Here, we have devised such a rapid method, in which at first a stock of monoclonal recombinant phage harboring the plasmid (phagemid) encoding the desired Fab is prepared and then this phage is used for a multiple rapid Fab expression and purification procedure.\n\n1. TG1 Competent Cells (Stratagene, San Diego, CA).\n\nPlasmid DNA: Phagemid encoding the Fab clone, which has been selected against specific antigen from a phage library (see Note 1). \n\n2YT medium: 10 g/L yeast extract (Bacto, Voigt Global Distribution), 16 g/L tryptone (Bacto, Voigt Global Distribution), and 5 g/L NaCl in deionized water.\n\nAutoclave and store at room temperature for no longer than 1 month.\n\nSupplemented 2YT agar plates: 15 g/L Select agar (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 10 g/L glucose in 2YT medium.

Pour 20 mL per 9-cm plate (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), and store plates at 4\u00b0C for no longer than 1 month.\n\nM13KO7 helper phage (NEB, Ipswich, MA).\n\n8. PEG/NaCl solution: 20% (v/v) PEG6000 and 2.5 M NaCl in water.\n\n1 For methods of selecting and purification of the Fab clone plasmid DNA please refer to the corresponding chapters in this book. In the present protocol, the Fab clones were encoded into the phagemid vector pComp 3X (13) that has 6-His and FLAG tags attached to the Fab C-terminus.\n\n1.

Pick up a single colony of the transformed TG1 cells and grow in 40 mL 2YT medium supplemented with 100 \u03bcg/mL ampicilin and 2 % glucose at 37\u00b0C until OD 600 reaches 0.8. It usually takes several hours.\n\n2 Transformation of the bacteria can be alternatively performed by electroporation according to the protocol by Stratagene. However, if there is no available electroporator, prepare competent cells as follows: Inoculate TG1 cells in 10 mL 2YT (see 2.1) and grow overnight. Dilute the overnight culture of wild type bacteria with 100 mL fresh 2YT medium. Grow until bacteria reach an optical density at 600 nm of 0.35-0.45, then keep bacteria on ice for a minimum of 15 min before centrifugation. Centrifuge at 3000g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. Discard the supernatant. Resuspend the bacterial pellet into 50 mL ice-cold CaCl 2 and keep on ice for 20 min. Cells must remain cold at all times and be treated gently in the presence of CaCl 2 . Centrifuge at 3000g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. Discard the supernatant and gently resuspend the pellet in 2 mL ice-cold CaCl 2 . Incubate on ice for at least one hour before using for transformation, or store in 30 \u03bcL aliquots at \u221280\u00b0C for later use.\n\nAdd M13KO7 helper phage at multiple of infection 10 to the bacteria and incubate at 37\u00b0C for another 30 minutes."}
