{"title": "Potential antivirals and antiviral strategies against SARS coronavirus infections", "body": "The metallopeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV [12]. ACE2 interacts with the S1 domain of the viral S glycoprotein, and this interaction and the subsequent infection can be blocked by both a soluble form of ACE2 and their anti-ACE2 antibody [12]. ACE2 expression in cell lines correlates with their susceptibility to SARS-CoV S-driven infection, suggesting that ACE2 must be a major receptor for SARS-CoV. This, in turn, suggests that the SARS-CoV S protein may be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention [13]. Interestingly, ACE2 expression positively correlated with the differentiation state of human airway epithelia; undifferentiated cells expressing little ACE2 were poorly infected with SARS-CoV, while well differentiated cells expressing more ACE2 were readily infected [14].\n\nA 193-amino acid fragment of the S protein (corresponding to residues 318\u2013510) binds to ACE2 more efficiently than the full S1 domain, and, in fact, the 193-residue fragment blocks S protein-mediated infection with an inhibitory concentration of 50% (IC50) of less than 10 nM (the IC50 of the full S1 domain being \u223c50 nM) [15]. Also, human monoclonal antibodies to the S1 protein domain block the association of SARS-CoV with ACE2, indicating that the ACE2 binding site of S1 could be a target for drug development [16]. A small-molecular-weight inhibitor that was found to interact with the ACE2 active catalytic site, (S,S)-2-(1-carboxy-2-[3-[3,5-dichlorobenzyl]-3H-imidazol-4-yl]-ethylamino)-4-methylpentanoic acid (MLN-4760) has been described [17]. Whether MLN-4760 inhibits SARS-CoV infection has not, as yet, been demonstrated.\n\nWhereas the S1 domain of the S glycoprotein determines virus attachment to the host cells, the subsequent virus\u2013cell fusion process is governed by conformational changes of the two heptad regions (HRs)-N (or HR1) and HR-C (or HR2) within the S2 domain, resulting in the formation of a 6-helix bundle (trimer of dimers). Systemic peptide mapping has shown that the site of interaction between the HR1 and HR2 regions is between residues 916 and 950 of HR1 and residues 1151\u20131185 of HR2 [18]. It has also been shown that a peptide, CP-1, derived from the HR2 region, inhibits SARS-CoV infection in the micromolar range: CP-1 bound with high affinity to a peptide from the HR1 region, NP-1 (Figure 2)[19]. CP-1 could bind to the HR1 region, thereby interfering with the conformational changes leading to the 6-helix bundle formation (Figure 3) and the therewith associated virus\u2013cell fusion process. Obviously, the HR1\u2013HR2 interaction may be viewed as an attractive target for the design of potent peptide-type SARS-CoV entry inhibitors [20,21], reminiscent of the HIV-1 gp41 HR2-derived peptide T20 (enfuvirtide) which has been developed as a HIV-1 fusion inhibitor [22]. The latter could inhibit the fusion of SARS-CoV with target cells, but apparently with too low efficiency to be therapeutically meaningful.\n\nRecently, Simmons and colleagues suggested that following receptor binding and induced conformational changes in the S glycoprotein, a third step would be involved in the viral entry process, namely cathepsin-L proteolysis within endosomes [23]. They demonstrated that a cathepsin-L-specific inhibitor, MDL 28170 (also known as calpain inhibitor III or Z-Val\u2013Phe[CHO]), at the same time inhibited cathepsin-L activity and S protein-mediated infection (at an IC50 of 2.5 nM and 0.1 \u00b5M, respectively). In addition to calpain inhibitor III, some other calpain inhibitors have been described as inhibitors of SARS-CoV replication, the most selective (selectivity index >100) being calpain inhibitor VI (4-fluorophenylsulfonyl Val\u2013Leu[CHO]) (Figure 4)[24].\n\nFollowing entry of SARS-CoV into the host cell, the genomic plus-stranded RNA is translated to produce two large overlapping replicase polyproteins, which are further processed to functional polypeptides through extensive proteolytic cleavage, mainly by the 3CLpro. The SARS 3C-like protease, also called main protease (Mpro) cleaves the replicase polyproteins at as many as 11 conserved sites, so as to generate the functional proteins necessary for virus replication. Mpro was quickly recognized as an attractive target for the development of anti-SARS-CoV agents [25]. It was proposed that compounds such as AG-7088, which had proven to be active against the rhinovirus 3C protease, could be modified in order to make them active against CoVs such as SARS-CoV [25]. As a first modification of AG-7088, the methylene group of the p-fluorophenylalanine residue was removed, and the resulting KZ7088 was modeled into the structure of the SARS-CoV Mpro [26].\n\nThe crystal structures of the SARS-CoV Mpro complexed with various substrate analogs, such as a hexapeptidyl chloromethyl ketone (Figure 5)[27] or aza-peptide epoxide [28] have been determined, and the recombinant SARS-CoV Mpro has been successfully cloned and expressed [29]. The information thus gathered on the mode of inhibitor binding and enzyme catalysis should help to provide a structural basis for rational drug design.\n\nOf a number of peptidomimetic compounds (aziridinyl peptides [30], keto-glutamine analogs [31], chymotrypsin-like protease inhibitors [32] and peptide anilides [33]) that have been reported as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV Mpro, the niclosamide anilide (Figure 6), with a Ki = 0.03 \u00b5M (IC50 = 0.06 \u00b5M), proved to the most potent (competitive) inhibitor [33]. Also, several nonpeptidic compounds have been described as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV Mpro: that is, etacrynic acid derivatives such as etacrynic acid amide (Ki = 35.3 \u00b5M) [34], isatin derivatives (IC50 values ranging from 0.95 to 17.50 \u00b5M) [35], hexachlorophene derivatives (IC50 values ranging from 7.6 to 84.5 \u00b5M) [36] and natural products from teas such as theaflavin-3,3\u00b4-digallate (IC50 = 9.5 \u00b5M) [37]. However, in none of these cases [30\u201337] was it ascertained whether the compounds were also effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV infection in cell culture, except for two of the chymotrypsin-like protease inhibitors [32] which were found to inhibit SARS-CoV in cell culture at a relatively high concentration (45 and 70 \u00b5M, respectively) [32].\n\nThere are only a few cases where the 3CL protease inhibitors were shown to inhibit both the SARS-CoV protease activity and virus replication in cell culture. The Phe\u2013Phe dipeptide inhibitor shown in Figure 7 was found to inhibit the 3CL protease at an IC50 of 1 \u00b5M (Ki = 0.52) and inhibited virus replication in Vero cells at an effective concentration of 50% (EC50) of 0.18 \u00b5M, while not being toxic to the host cells at a concentration of 200 \u00b5M (selectivity index: >1000) [38]. Cinanserin (SQ 10,643, a well characterized serotonin antagonist) Figure 8 is another example of an inhibitor of SARS-CoV replication which may act via inhibition of the 3CL protease (IC50 for the enzyme = 5 \u00b5M; EC50 values for reduction of viral RNA and infectious particles ranging from 19 to 34 \u00b5M) [39]. Finally, an octapeptide, designed for the SARS-CoV Mpro, namely AVLQSGFR, was reported to inhibit SARS-CoV replication in Vero cells at an EC50 of 0.027 \u00b5g/ml, while not being cytotoxic at 100 \u00b5g/ml, thus establishing a selectivity index of greater than 3700 [40]. Whether this highly selective antiviral effect was actually mediated by an inhibition of the SARS-CoV Mpro was not ascertained in this study [40].\n\nIn addition to 3CLpro, a PLpro is encoded by the SARS-CoV genome. SARS-CoV PLpro processes the replicase polyprotein at three conserved cleavage sites, thus generating the nonstructural proteins NSP1, NSP2 and NSP3. It was recently demonstrated that SARS-CoV PLpro also had deubiquitinating activity [41,42]. The possibility that SARS-CoV PLpro could deubiquitinate host or viral proteins has added a higher level of functional complexity to this enzyme, and should, in principle, elevate the value of SARS-CoV PLpro as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.\n\nSARS-CoV encodes for an helicase which must unwind the double-stranded (\u00b1)RNA helices during the viral replication cycle. This helicase, akin to the herpesviral DNA helicase, also possesses NTPase activity, and may therefore be termed an NTPase/helicase. The SARS-CoV NTPase/helicase has been considered a potential target for the development of anti-SARS-CoV agents [43]. These agents could, in theory, be targeted at any of the three major domains of the enzyme, the N-terminal metal-binding domain, the hinge domain and the NTPase/helicase domain. Bananin (Figure 9) and three of its derivatives (iodobananin, vanillinbananin and eubananin) were shown to inhibit both the ATPase and helicase activity of the SARS-CoV NTPase/helicase, with IC50 values (for the ATPase activity) in the range of 0.5\u20133 \u00b5M [44]. Bananin was also found to inhibit SARS-CoV replication in fetal rhesus kidney (FRhK)-4 cells at an EC50 of less than 10 \u00b5M and a 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) of over 300 \u00b5M, thus exhibiting a selectivity index of over 30 [44]. Whether the antiviral effect obtained in cell culture was causally linked to the inhibition of the NTPase/helicase was not ascertained.\n\nThe SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), due to its pivotal role in viral replication, represents another potential target for anti-SARS therapy. This enzyme (Figure 10) does not contain a hydrophobic pocket for non-nucleoside inhibitors similar to those that have proven effective against the hepatits C virus (HCV) polymerase or HIV-1 reverse transcriptase [45]. In fact, non-nucleoside HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors were shown to have no evident inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV RdRp activity [46]. It is intriguing that during purification, the full-length SARS-CoV RdRp was unstable and was hydrolytically cleaved into three fragments, a N-terminal p12 fragment, a middle p30 fragment and a C-terminal p64 fragment comprising the catalytic domain. The cause of the cleavage is unclear. Nor is it clear whether this cleavage also occurs in the viral life cycle [46]. At present, few, if any, nucleoside analogs have been recognized as specific inhibitors of the SARS-CoV RdRp. There is N4-hydroxycytidine, which has been accredited with both anti-HCV and anti-SARS-CoV effects. Against SARS-CoV it proved active at an EC50 of 10 \u00b5M (selectivity index \u2265 10) [24]. However, whether this antiviral effect was mediated by an inhibition of the viral RdRp was not ascertained.\n\nGiven the large genome of SARS-CoV (and other CoVs), and the need for discontinuous transcription to generate subgenomic transcripts, they could be expected to encode novel RNA-processing functions. Indeed, a number of such proteins have been identified: NSP14, a putative exonuclease; NSP15, an endoribonuclease and NSP16, a putative RNA methyltransferase. RNA endonuclease activity is unusual among positive-strand RNA viruses, suggesting that, because it specifically occurs during SARS-CoV replication, it could be considered a target for antiviral drug development. This pertains, in particular, NSP15, to an Mn2+-dependent endoribonuclease that specifically cleaves RNA at unpaired uridylate residues. The role of NSP15, which consists of six subunits (arranged as a dimer of trimers) [47] in the CoV infection process, still remains to be elucidated.\n\nAs mentioned above, human monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the S1 domain of the S protein of SARS-CoV blocks its association with the host cell ACE2 receptor [16]. The mAb concerned, 80R immunoglobulin (Ig)G1, was further evaluated for its immunoprophylactic efficacy in vivo in a mouse model [48]. When 80R IgG1 was given prophylactically to mice at doses therapeutically achievable in humans, viral replication was reduced by more than four orders of magnitude to below assay limits. The results demonstrated that the vast majority of SARS-CoVs isolated thus far remain sensitive to 80R. In an outbreak setting, early and rapid genotyping of the S1 gene fragment encoding the 80R epitope should provide an accurate guide for installment of immunoprophylaxis with 80R [48].\n\nData generated with human mAb (CR304) against SARS-CoV in ferrets also point to the feasibility of immunoprophylaxis with human mAb for the control of human SARS-CoV infections [49]. Similar observations in a mouse model demonstrating that primary infection with SARS-CoV provides protection from reinfection and that antibody alone can protect against viral replication, suggest that vaccines that induce neutralizing antibodies and strategies for immunoprophylaxis or, perhaps, immunotherapy are likely to be effective against SARS [50].\n\nMost of the SARS-CoV-infected patients spontaneously recover, and recovered patients have higher and sustainable levels of both N and S glycoprotein-specific antibody responses, suggesting that antibody responses are likely to play an important role in determining the ultimate disease outcome of SARS-CoV-infected patients [51]. It would, therefore, not be unreasonable to expect that antibody to SARS-CoV, as present in convalescent plasma [52], may favorably influence the course of SARS.\n\nAs an interesting hypothesis, derived from the experience gathered with HIV [53], it may be proposed that antibody towards carbohydrate-hidden immunogenic epitopes on the SARS-CoV envelope may confer an immunoprophylactic, as well as an immunotherapeutic approach towards CoV and various other enveloped virus infections. To enable this approach, carbohydrate-binding agents, such as the Hippeastrum hybrid (amaryllis), Galanthus nivalis (snowdrop) and Urtica dioica mannose- or N-acetylglucosamine-binding lectins could be used to cause deletions, upon repeated exposure (passages), of the glycosylation sites in the SARS-CoV envelope in order to expose the carbohydrate-hidden epitopes to both active (vaccine) and passive (antibody) immune responses.\n\nShortly after SARS-CoV had been identified as the causative agent of SARS, Cinatl and colleagues [54] were the first to note that interferons (IFNs) inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV in cell culture in vitro; IFN-\u03b2 being more potent than either IFN-\u03b1 or -\u03b3. These observations were subsequently confirmed in several other studies [55\u201358]. IFN-\u03b2 exhibited potent antiviral activity at doses that had been shown to have acceptable safety profiles [55]. Also, IFN-\u03b1 showed an in vitro inhibitory effect starting at concentrations of 1000 IU/ml [56]. In contrast with type I IFNs (\u03b1, \u03b2), type II IFN (\u03b3) had little, if any, inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV replication [57]. The human MxA protein is one of the most prominent proteins induced by IFN-\u03b2. Nevertheless, no interference with SARS-CoV replication was observed in Vero cells stably expressing MxA, which implies that other IFN-induced proteins must be responsible for the strong inhibitory activity of IFN-\u03b2 against SARS-CoV [58].\n\nIFN-\u03b2, in conjunction with IFN-\u03b3, was found to synergistically inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV in Vero cells [59], and a preliminary uncontrolled study with the IFN alfacon-1 (a synthetic IFN-\u03b1 designed to represent a consensus IFN-\u03b1) suggested that this type of IFN, in combination with corticosteroids might be effective in vivo in the treatment of SARS [60]. Furthermore, a CpG oligodeoxynucleotide, which is able to induce human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to produce high levels of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, has been accredited with strong activity against SARS-CoV in vitro[61].\n\nBeing a prophylactic rather than therapeutic agent, IFN(s) may have their highest utility in the prophylaxis or early postexposure management of SARS. Pegylated (PEG)-IFN-\u03b1 has been shown to reduce viral replication and excretion, viral antigen expression by type 1 pneumocytes and the attendant pulmonary damage in cynomolgous macaques that were infected experimentally with SARS-CoV [62]. PEG-IFN-\u03b1 is commercially available for the treatment of HCV (where it is generally used in combination with ribavirin) and hepatitis B. PEG-IFN-\u03b1 as well as the other commercially available IFNs (e.g., IFN-\u03b2 and alfacon-1) could be considered for prevention and/or early postexposure treatment of SARS should it re-emerge.\n\nRNA interference (RNAi) can be defined as silencing of gene expression through degradation of (the target) RNA [63]. RNAi can be broken down into two main phases. In the first phase, long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is processed by Dicer, an RNAse III enzyme into duplexes of short interfering RNA (siRNA) of 21\u201324 nucleotides in length. Exogenous synthetic siRNAs can also be incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), thereby bypassing the requirement for dsRNA processing by Dicer. In the second phase, a helicase present in RISC unwinds the duplex siRNA, which then pairs by means of its unwound antisense strand to its target messenger RNA (mRNA) that bears a high degree of sequence complementarity to the siRNA. An RNAse (Slicer) within RISC then proceeds to degrade the target mRNA at sites not bound by the siRNA, that is, 10 nucleotides upstream of the 5\u00b4-most residue of the siRNA-target mRNA duplex [63].\n\nThus, siRNAs have been developed that target the replicase [64] and S [65] genes of the SARS-CoV genome, thereby silencing their expression in cell culture. Potent siRNA inhibitors of SARS-CoV in vitro (i.e., the siRNA duplexes siSC2 [forward sequence: 5\u00b4-GCUCCUAAUUACACUCAACdtdt-3\u00b4] and siSC5 [forward sequence: 5\u00b4-GGAUGAGGAAGGCAAUUUAdtdt-3\u00b4], targeting the SARS-CoV genomeat S protein- and NSP12-coding regions, respectively) were further evaluated for their efficacy in a rhesus macaque SARS model [66], and were found to provide relief from SARS-CoV infection-induced fever, diminish SARS-CoV levels and reduce acute diffuse alveolar damage. No sign of toxicity was observed with the siRNA concerned [66]. Whether SARS can be conquered by the siRNA approach remains to be proven, however [67]. Therefore, the siRNA delivery forms should be further optimized, and the most effective target within the SARS-CoV genome should be identified. Since siRNAs, at least in their second stage of action, obey the antisense principle, antisense strategies such as those based on peptide-conjugated antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (P-PMOs) also deserve closer attention [68].\n\nA growing number of compounds have been identified as SARS-CoV replication inhibitors exhibiting mechanisms of action which are both diverse and largely unexplored. Of greater than 10,000 agents tested against SARS-CoV in Vero cells, approximately 50 compounds were found active at less than or equal to 10 \u00b5M [69]; as the most potent inhibitor, with an EC50 of 0.85 \u00b5M (selectivity index = 80), emerged valinomycin, a peptidic insecticide acting as a potassium ion transporter (Figure 11). Inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV replication, with selectivity indexes of up to 100, and EC50 values as low as 1 \u00b5g/ml, have been observed for a variety of compounds including the vancomycin, eremomycin and teicoplanin aglycon derivatives [70], and the mannose-specific plant lectins derived from G. nivalis, Hippeastrum hybrid[71] and Allium porrum (leek) [72]. The mode of action of these compounds has not been assessed, but it is tempting to speculate that they interfere with the binding of the S glycoprotein to the host cells.\n\nIsatis indigotica root and phenolic Chinese herbs were frequently used for the prevention of SARS during the SARS outbreaks in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. I. indigotica root (Radix isatidis) is native to China. From the I. indigotica root extracts several compounds, that is, indigo, sinigrin, aloe-emodin and hesperetin, were isolated that inhibited the cell-free and cell-based cleavage activity of the SARS Mpro (3CLpro) at IC50 values ranging from 10 to 1000 \u00b5M [73]. The inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV replication in cell culture (i.e., Vero cells) were not determined in this study. The cytotoxicity was determined, however, and, based on the ratio of the CC50 to the IC50 (cell-based cleavage), hesperetin appeared to be the most selective (selectivity index: \u223c300) [73].\n\nGlycyrrhizin, another plant product that has been isolated from the licorice root (Glycyrrhiza radix), is known as an anti-inflammatory substance in Chinese medicine. Glycyrrhizin consists of one molecule of glycyrrhetinic acid linked to two molecules of glucuronic acid (Figure 12). It has long since been recognized as an antiviral substance, active in vitro against both DNA and RNA viruses, including HIV [74,75]. Glycyrrhizin has also been shown to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV, but only at a concentration (EC50: 300 \u00b5g/ml or \u223c365 \u00b5M) that would be difficult to achieve in vivo[76]. Through the introduction of certain chemical modifications it proved possible to increase the antiviral potency of glycyrrhizin, but, as these modifications also increased the cytotoxicity, the selectivity index of the glycyrrhizin derivatives was reduced as compared with that of glycyrrhizin (selectivity index: \u226565) [77].\n\nPotent and selective inhibition of SARS-CoV replication has also been shown for aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) [78]; reported values for its EC50 and CC50 (in Vero cells) were 0.2 and 37.5 mg/ml, respectively. Thus, the selectivity index of ATA was estimated to be 187 [78]. The anti-SARS-CoV activity of ATA was tentatively attributed to an inhibitory effect on the viral RdRp [79]. It should be recognized, however, that ATA, which is commonly represented in its monomeric structure but actually occurs as a heterogenous mixture of polymers (Figure 13), is able to bind to, and inhibit, a variety of proteins and cellular processes [80,81]. ATA has since long been known as an inhibitor of HIV replication [82], and its anti-HIV activity is at least partially mediated by a specific interaction with the HIV cell receptor CD4 [83].\n\nRibavirin, another compound that has long since been known as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent [84], targeted at inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase (a key enzyme involved in the de novo biosynthesis of GTP) [85], did not show meaningful activity against SARS-CoV replication in cell culture [56,76]. Its EC50, determined by virus yield reduction in Vero cells, was 40 \u00b5g/ml (CC50 > 200 \u00b5g/ml; selectivity index >5) [86]. In comparison, mizoribine, which is also assumed to act in its monophosphorylated form, as an inhibitor of the IMP dehydrogenase, exhibited an EC50 of 10 \u00b5g/ml (CC50 > 200 \u00b5g/ml; selectivity index > 20) [86]. Although these findings do not legitimate the use of ribavirin or mizoribine (Figure 14A) as single agents in the treatment of SARS, they point to IMP dehydrogenase as a potential target for the development of more potent anti-SARS-CoV agents.\n\nThe 4-aminoquinoline chloroquine, another \u2018old\u2019 compound best known for its antimalarial effects, but also accredited with antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects, has been recommended for its potential use, preferably in combination with other antivirals, in the treatment of AIDS as well as SARS [87]. Chloroquine (Figure 14B) was found to inhibit SARS-CoV replication in Vero cells at an EC50 of 8.8 \u00b5M (CC50 = 261 \u00b5M; selectivity index = 30) [88]. These inhibitory effects were observed when the cells were treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus [89]. The EC50 of chloroquine for inhibition of SARS-CoV in vitro approximates the plasma concentrations of chloroquine reached during treatment of acute malaria [88].\n\nInhibition of SARS-CoV infection in vitro has also been reported for a nitric oxide (NO) generating compound, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), but only at an EC50 as high as 222 \u00b5M and a selectivity index as low as 2.6 [90]. Niclosamide (Figure 14C), an existing antihelminthic drug, was able to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV in Vero cells at an EC50 of 2 \u00b5M, while its CC50 was 250 \u00b5M; its selectivity could therefore be estimated at 125 [91].\n\nThen there are the HIV protease inhibitors nelfinavir [92] and lopinavir [93] which have been reported to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV in Vero cells and FRhK-4 cells, respectively. In vitro activity against SARS-CoV was demonstrated for lopinavir at a concentration of 4 \u00b5g/ml (in comparison with 50 \u00b5g/ml for ribavirin) [93]. Yamamoto and colleagues were not able to find a selective antiviral effect with lopinavir, but for nelfinavir they found an EC50 of 0.048 \u00b5M (CC50 = 14.5 \u00b5M; selectivity index = 300) [91]. Preliminary clinical trials in the treatment of SARS with lopinavir (boosted by ritonavir) point to an apparent favorable clinical response [93,94].\n\nDetailed knowledge on the molecular structure and functioning of most of the SARS-encoded proteins, except for the Mpro (3CLpro) is lacking, which means that thus far, few, if any, successful attempts have been made to rationally design anti-SARS-CoV compounds. Most of the antiviral compounds which have thus far been found effective against SARS-CoV, were evaluated because they had previously been shown (or were analogous to compounds that had been shown previously) to be effective against viruses other than SARS-CoV, in particular HIV.\n\nIt could be postulated that to become a potential anti-SARS candidate drug, the SARS-CoV inhibitor should possess a selectivity index of greater than 100, equally importantly an EC50 of not (much) higher than 1\u20133 \u00b5M, so as to be able to achieve sufficiently high plasma (and tissue) drug levels upon systemic administration. Thus, qualifying as potential anti-SARS drug candidates are some of the calpain inhibitors [23,24] and 3CLpro inhibitors, for example, the Phe\u2013Phe dipeptide inhibitor shown in Figure 7[38], which exhibited an EC50 of 0.18 \u00b5M and a selectivity index greater than 1000. Also, the octapeptide, AVLQSGFR, with an EC50 of 0.027 \u00b5g/ml (selectivity index >3700) [40] seems quite promising following the proposed criteria, and thus would be a number of the miscellaneous compounds such as valinomycin [69], niclosamide [90] and nelfinavir [91].\n\nOf equal, if not greater, importance is proof of efficacy against SARS in the in vivo setting, which remains to be provided with the aforementioned compounds. Such proof of principle exists for human mAbs [48,49], IFN-\u03b1 [62] and siRNA [66], which means that, should SARS-CoV, or a similar CoV, re-emerge, attempts could be immediately undertaken to prevent and/or treat these infections with human mAbs, IFN and/or siRNA. Being commercially available at present, IFNs (PEG-IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 and alfacon-1 etc.) should possibly be considered the best choice to curb SARS, should it strike again.\n\nFinally, as has thus far been applied in several viral (i.e., HIV and HCV) infections, and could be recommended for others (i.e., avian influenza), drug combination therapy certainly represents a valuable option for the management of SARS-CoV infection. As for any drug combination approach, this should allow the individual drugs to show a synergistic antiviral effect, thereby reducing the likelihood for drug resistance development (which, admittedly, has so far not been recognized as a problem in the treatment of SARS).\n\nIt is hard to predict whether SARS-CoV, or a similar CoV, would strike again in the future. This makes it impossible to speculate on how the field will evolve over the next 5 years. However, as for avian influenza H5N1, we ought to be better prepared. Therefore, attempts should continue to develop the appropriate means to prevent and/or treat SARS-CoV infections. The development of an adequate vaccine against SARS (not discussed here) remains, of course, mandatory, but, in addition, other prophylactic/therapeutic options should be duly explored, and these include, besides human mAbs, IFNs and siRNAs, also low-molecular-weight SARS-CoV inhibitors targeted at any of the specific processes involved in the viral replication cycle (i.e., viral entry into the cells, proteolytic cleavage, RNA replication and transcription)."}
