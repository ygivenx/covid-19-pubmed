{"title": "Structure of the SARS-CoV NSP12 polymerase bound to NSP7 and NSP8 co-factors", "body": "Coronaviruses (CoV) represent a diverse family of positive-sense RNA viruses capable of causing respiratory and enteric disease in human and animal hosts. Though there are several human coronaviruses responsible for a mild respiratory disease 1 , most notable are the highly pathogenic human coronaviruses: SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV capable of causing a severe respiratory disease. The zoonotic SARS-CoV emerged into human populations in 2002, spreading to 26 countries during its brief nine month circulation in humans 2 . This epidemic resulted in over 8,000 infections with a ~10% case fatality rate and was eventually contained through public health measures, as there are no specific treatments approved for human coronavirus infections. With the exception of a smaller second SARS-CoV outbreak in 2004 3 , SARS-CoV has been absent from human circulation since the initial outbreak ended. Despite the lack of recent human infections, SARS-CoVlike viruses continue to circulate in bat reservoirs 4 . Similar to SARS-CoV, the zoonotic MERS-CoV also causes a severe respiratory infection in humans and has so far shown limited human-to-human transmission outside of hospital settings 5 . However, ongoing zoonotic transmissions of MERS-CoV have continued since 2012 5 . Outbreaks of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses remain an emerging threat to global health security and given past history are likely to continue to occur.\n\nThe threat of a novel emerging virus from the diverse coronavirus family necessitates antiviral strategies targeting conserved elements of the viral life cycle such as the viral machinery responsible for the replication and transcription of the positive-strand viral RNA genome. The multisubunit coronavirus RNA synthesis machinery is a complex of non-structural proteins (NSPs) produced as cleavage products of the ORF1a and ORF1ab viral polyproteins 6 . The NSP12 RNAdependent RNA polymerase possesses some minimal activity on its own 7 , but the addition of the NSP7 and NSP8 co-factors greatly stimulates polymerase activity 8 . Though additional viral NSP subunits are likely necessary to carry out the full repertoire of replication and transcription activities, the NSP12-NSP7-NSP8 complex so far represents the minimal complex required for nucleotide polymerization. In addition, many other coronavirus NSPs possess enzyme activities related to RNA modification 9, 10 .\n\nAfter the emergence of SARS-CoV, there was an intense effort to structurally characterize the replication complexes of coronaviruses. This resulted in high-resolution structure determination for many of the SARS-CoV NSPs in isolation using X-ray crystallography and NMR 11, 12 . In addition, complexes of NSP7-NSP8, NSP10-NSP14 and NSP10-NSP16 were also determined [13] [14] [15] . One notable gap in our structural knowledge of the coronavirus RNA synthesis complex was a figure 3) . B) SARS-CoV NSP12 contains a large N-terminal extension composed of the NiRAN domain (dark red) and an interface domain (purple) adjacent to the polymerase domain (orange). NSP12 binds to a heterodimer of NSP7 (blue) and NSP8 (green) as well as a second subunit of NSP8. C-E) Comparison of SARS-CoV NSP12 to the polymerase proteins of poliovirus 23 (3OL6.pdb) and dengue virus 53 (4V0R.pdb). Viral RNA polymerases share an overall structural architecture with fingers (blue), palm (orange) and thumb domains (red). Both SARS-CoV and dengue virus polymerase proteins contain N-terminal extensions (grey). structure of the NSP12 RNA polymerase. Here, we used cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) to determine the 3.1 \u00c5 resolution structure of SARS-CoV NSP12 bound to the NSP7 and NSP8 cofactors. This 160 kDa complex defines the largest portion of the viral RNA synthesis complex yet to be structurally characterized at high resolution. In addition to a structurally conserved polymerase domain, this complex provides the first views of a nidovirus-unique NSP12 N-terminal extension that possesses a kinase-like fold and demonstrates an unexpected binding stoichiometry of NSP7 and NSP8 co-factors.\n\nOur cryoEM structure shows the NSP12 polymerase bound to a NSP7-NSP8 heterodimer with a second subunit of NSP8 occupying a distinct binding site (Fig 1B) . NSP12 contains a polymerase domain (a.a. 398-919) that assumes a structure resembling a cupped \"right hand\" similar to other polymerases 16 (Fig 1C) . The polymerase domain is comprised of a fingers domain (a.a. 398-581), a palm domain (a.a. 582-815) and a thumb domain (a.a. 816-919). Coronavirus NSP12 also contains a nidovirus-unique N-terminal extension of which Table 1) .\n\nAlthough not previously predicted, the SARS-CoV NSP12 contains two metal binding sites to which we have assigned zinc atoms. The first is in the nidovirus-unique extension and is coordinated by His295, Cys301, Cys306, and Cys310. The second is in the fingers domain and is coordinated by Cys487, His642, Cys645, and Cys646. All eight of these metal-coordinating amino acids are highly conserved across the coronavirus family ( Supplementary Fig 3) . Both of these metal-binding sites are distal to known active sites, protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. Thus, these ions are expected to be structural components of the folded protein rather than directly involved in enzymatic activity. The presence of structural zinc ions in NSP12 is reminiscent of bound zinc atoms in SARS-CoV NSP3, NSP10 and NSP13 and NSP14 11, 14, 17, 18 and points to an extensive utilization of zinc ions for folding proteins of the viral replication complex.\n\nThe outer surface of NSP12 carries a largely negative electrostatic potential (Fig 2A) . However, the polymerase RNA-template and NTP-binding sites carry a strong positive electrostatic potential. The NSP7 and two NSP8 binding sites as well as the RNA exit tunnel are comparatively neutral. Similarly, the NSP7 and NSP8 surfaces contacting NSP12 are also relatively neutral. The second subunit of NSP8 contains some basic residues in the N-terminal region visible in the structure (a.a. 77-98) contributing to an extension of the positive electrostatics of the template binding channel.\n\nAnalysis of sequence conservation across the coronavirus family reveals that the template entry, template-primer exit and NTP tunnels, as well as the polymerase active site, are the most highly conserved surfaces on NSP12 (Fig 2B) . There is also a conserved surface on the NSP12 nidovirus-unique extension which may represent an interaction site for the N-terminal disordered domain of NSP12 (1-116) that is not resolved in the structure (Fig 2C,D) . The binding site for the NSP7-NSP8 heterodimer is well .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/551986 doi: bioRxiv preprint conserved and overlaps with the conserved regions of polymerase functional domains (fingers and thumb domains). Conversely, there is less conservation of the second NSP8 binding site on NSP12. The most conserved NSP12 residues contact the NSP8 N-terminal region (77-126), while contacts with the NSP8 C-terminal head domain are mediated primarily by main-chain atoms which may have less stringent requirements in their amino acid composition to retain binding.\n\nThe SARS-CoV NSP12 is 932 amino acids in length, which is in contrast to the polymerases of the closely related picornaviruses that are typically closer to 500 amino acids. While the C-terminal region of NSP12 contains the RNA-polymerase domain, the large N-terminal nidovirus-unique extension has long remained enigmatic. Sequence analysis of polymerase subunits across the Nidovirales order, which includes coronaviruses, revealed three conserved sequence motifs within this region: AN (SARS-CoV a.a. 69-89), BN (a.a. 112-130), and CN (a.a. 202-222) 10 (Supplementary Fig.  3 ). Further experimentation revealed that the equine arterivirus (EAV) polymerase subunit could be covalently modified with NTPs and that amino acids within the identified conserved motifs were important for this activity, the proposed active site being a lysine residue in AN (SARS-CoV Lys73) 10 . The conserved regions of the polymerase harboring this nucleotidyltransferase activity were termed NiRAN (nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase) 10 . However, the role and mechanisms of this nucleotidyltransferase activity remains to be elucidated.\n\nThe NSP12 nidovirus-unique extension contacts the polymerase on the outside of the fingers domain and at the base of the palm domain (Fig 1) . Despite attempts at focused refinement of the cryo-EM map, the N-terminal 116 amino acids of NSP12 are not visible in the structure. Diffuse density localized to this region in the cryoEM reconstructions suggests that the N-terminus is present but highly flexible. The portion of the NSP12 N-terminal extension that we observe in the map (a.a. 117-397) forms a contiguous domain with the fingers domain using a large number of well-conserved hydrophobic interactions.\n\nThe nidovirus-unique extension observed in the structure can be divided into at least two distinct regions: the NiRAN domain (a.a. 117-250) and an Interface domain (251-398) though both regions are likely to be reliant on one another and on the polymerase domains for proper folding, hence domain boundaries are ambiguous. The Interface domain (a.a. 251-398) acts as a protein-interaction junction, contacting the NiRAN domain, the fingers domain and the second subunit of NSP8.\n\nThe observed NiRAN domain contains the majority of motif BN as well as motif CN. This region interacts with the base of the polymerase palm and fingers domains. It is interesting that the observed ordered region in the structure begins within the conserved sequence motif BN and implies a functional role for this linker region between the Nterminal disordered domain and the remaining NSP12 domains. The conserved amino acids from motifs BN and CN appear to form a single site on NSP12 (Fig 2C,D) . Of the seven NiRAN amino acids which are strictly conserved across the Nidovirales order, we observe four. Asp126 forms the center of the conserved face while Asp218 and F219 are on an external loop near the bottom of the conserved face. While these three amino acids are exposed, Gly214 is in a loop turn and is directed away from the conserved face possibly indicating this residue's importance in proper positioning of the downstream Asp218 and F219 rather than direct involvement in NiRAN activity.\n\nAs noted above, the SARS-CoV RNAdependent RNA polymerase resembles a cupped right hand with fingers, palm and thumb subdomains. Within the fingers domain are the index, middle, ring and pinky finger loops. In positive-strand RNA virus polymerases, the index finger loop reaches over the active site to contact the thumb domain, positioning the ring-finger loop beneath it 19 . In SARS-CoV NSP12, the contacts between the index finger and the thumb domain are particularly extensive with the positioning of an alpha-helix in the index finger loop to pack with the thumb helical bundle. The index finger-thumb interaction site also forms the NSP7-NSP8 heterodimer binding site with most of the contacts made between NSP12 and NSP7.\n\nAll viral polymerases possess seven conserved motif regions (A-G) involved in template and nucleotide binding and catalysis [20] [21] [22] (Fig 1A, Fig  3A and Supplemental Fig 3) . Superposition of the elongation complexes of poliovirus 23 and norovirus 24 onto the SARS-CoV NSP12 reveals the path of the RNA past the active site and indicates amino acids involved in binding or catalysis (Fig 3B) . Singlestranded RNA template threads its way past motif G .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/551986 doi: bioRxiv preprint before entering the active site composed of motifs A and C and supported by motif B and D. Incoming nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs) would enter the active site through a tunnel at the back and interact with motif F. Motif E at the base of the thumb interacts with the 3' nucleotide of the primer strand 25 . The primer-template product of RNA synthesis exits the active site though the RNA exit tunnel. This double-stranded RNA product would interact with the N-terminal region of motif G in the fingers domain via the major groove while a helix (SARS-CoV a.a. 851-864) from the thumb domain interacts with the minor groove.\n\nA notable aspect of the coronavirus polymerase is the lack of a clear mechanism for de novo initiation. Structurally, the SARS-CoV NSP12 most closely resembles the polymerases of picornaviruses such as poliovirus, norovirus and rhinovirus 23, 24 . Picornaviruses use a protein primer called VPg to prime RNA synthesis and serve as a 5' cap. However, coronaviruses cap their RNAs with a 5' GTP resembling host RNAs 26 and hence are likely to use a distinct mechanism for RNA initiation. Biochemical evidence has shown that the NSP12-NSP7-NSP8 complex possesses de novo initiation activity that is dependent on the NSP12 polymerase active site 8 similar to viruses of the Flaviviridae family such as Dengue virus and hepatitis C virus which use protein elements within the thumb domain to position a priming nucleotide in the -1 primer position 27 . However, the SARS-CoV NSP12 dsRNA exit tunnel has no obstructions. Hence, the mechanism by which coronavirus polymerases carry out de novo RNA initiation is likely to be distinct from either the picoronavirues or flaviviruses, but the nature of this mechanism remains unclear.\n\nCoronaviruses possess the largest known RNA genomes and require an RNA synthesis complex with the fidelity to faithfully replicate their RNA. Coronaviruses have evolved a higher replication fidelity through the incorporation of additional protein activities such as the NSP14 exonuclease 28 . In addition, the evolutionary driving force to create a high-fidelity RNA synthesis complex has also produced viruses which are naturally resistant to many antiviral nucleoside analogs. In the polymerase active site, incoming NTPs base pair with the template RNA while the 2' and 3' hydroxyls hydrogen bond with the polymerase. In SARS-CoV NSP12 the 2' hydroxyl of the incoming NTP is likely to form hydrogen bonds with Thr680 and Asn691 in motif B. In addition, Asp623 is positioned to interrogate the 3' hydroxyl though hydrogen-bonding. All three of .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/551986 doi: bioRxiv preprint these residues are conserved across the coronavirus family.\n\nBase pairing of the incoming NTP is also facilitated by stacking of the +1 template RNA base on a hydrophobic side chain in motif F. In SARS-CoV NSP12, this amino acid is Val557. When murine hepatitis virus (MHV), a betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV, was passaged in the presence of nucleoside analog GS-5734, two mutations in NSP12 with partial resistance arose: Phe480Leu and Val557Leu 29 (SARS-CoV NSP12 numbering). The presence of the bulkier leucine side chain at amino acid 557 is likely to create a greater stringency for base pairing to the templating nucleotide and this amino acid position has previously been indicated in modulating polymerase fidelity 30 . Amino acid 480 is located in the fingers domain contacting motif B and may impact active site dynamics related to catalysis.\n\nThe coronavirus RNA synthesis complex is governed by a large number of protein-protein interactions. Both NSP7 and NSP8 have essential roles in the formation and activity of the RNA synthesis machinery 8 (Supplementary Fig. 4) . The co-crystal structure of SARS-CoV NSP7 and NSP8 demonstrated that the NSP8 C-terminal head domain folds around the NSP7 helical bundle 15 . The Nterminal region of NSP8 (1-81) adopts a more extended or disordered conformation. In the crystal packing of the NSP7-NSP8 structure, the authors hypothesized the formation of a hetero-hexadecamer protein complex. However, for feline coronavirus (FCV), the co-crystal structure of NSP7 and NSP8 displayed a 2:1 stoichiometry and lacked higher order oligomer formation hypothesized in the SARS-CoV NSP7-NSP8 structure 31 . NSP8 has also been suggested to possess RNA primase activity 32 . Mutagenesis has suggested this activity lies in the Nterminal region of NSP8 and requires the formation of large oligomeric complexes to bring the active site residues into proximity 32, 33 . However, more recent work has shown that the SARS-CoV NSP7-NSP8-NSP12 complex was capable of de novo initiation and that this activity was dependent on the NSP12 polymerase active site 8 . The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/551986 doi: bioRxiv preprint A number of studies have confirmed the direct interaction between NSP8 and NSP12 [34] [35] [36] . In addition, NSP12 has also been suggested to interact with NSP5, NSP9 and NSP13 34 while NSP8 has been suggested to interact with NSP7, NSP8, NSP9, NSP10, NSP13 and NSP14 36 . The large number of interactions between NSP8 and NSP12 with the other viral NSPs suggests that these two proteins form a hub for protein-protein interactions within the viral replication complex. However, the structures of NSP7, NSP8 and NSP12 together, their stoichiometry and how they present their surfaces for additional interactions had remained unclear.\n\nExamination of the cryo-EM map revealed density for a single complex of NSP7-NSP8 heterodimer resembling previously determined crystal structures (Fig 4A) . This density includes NSP7 2-71 and NSP8 84-192 encompassing the NSP8 head domain while the N-terminal region of NSP8 appears to be disordered. The NSP7-NSP8 heterodimer binds to NSP12 on the polymerase thumb domain facing the NTP entry channel. Binding in this position, sandwiches the NSP12 polymerase index finger loop between NSP7-NSP8 and the polymerase thumb domain. The NSP12 index finger loop has been previously identified as necessary for recruitment of NSP12 to replication complexes 34 . The binding of the NSP7-NSP8 heterodimer to this loop suggests that NSP7-NSP8 facilitates the interaction of NSP12 with additional components of the RNA synthesis machinery for incorporation into viral replication complexes.\n\nModel building of the NSP12-NSP7-NSP8 complex revealed unexpected density for a second subunit of NSP8 (a.a. . This second subunit of NSP8 interacts with the NSP12 interface domain proximal to the fingers domain and the RNA template binding channel. The identification of an interaction of NSP8 with the N-terminal region of NSP12 is supported by a recent study of infectious bronchitis virus, a gammacoronavirus, where NSP12 1-400 was sufficient to interact with NSP8 35 . The second subunit of NSP8 a.a. 127-191 resembles the NSP8 head domains of previously determined crystal structures as well as the NSP7-NSP8 heterodimer bound to NSP12 discussed above. However, the region of the second subunit of NSP8 a.a. 98-126 appears to adopt a conformation unique from those previously observed and involves a refolding of loops and a helical region to participate in interactions with NSP12 (Fig. 4B) . Comparing both the NSP7-NSP8 heterodimer and the second subunit of NSP8 structures as bound to NSP12 with the previously determined SARS-CoV NSP7-NSP8 complex, we find the higher order NSP7-NSP8 oligomer formation inferred from crystal packing to be incompatible with the interfaces observed in the NSP12 bound states. Consequently, amino acids identified as important for NSP8's RNA primase activity 32 would not be brought into close proximity. Hence, formation of this proposed primase active site is inconsistent with the structural data here but is in agreement with previous biochemical studies of the NSP7-NSP8-NSP12 complex 8 .\n\nSARS-CoV NSP7 and NSP8 have been The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/551986 doi: bioRxiv preprint extensively mutated and tested in in vitro polymerase activity assays 8 . Of three NSP7 mutants previously found to diminish polymerase activity, K7A hydrogen bonds to the carbonyls of the NSP7 25-42 helix which interacts with NSP12 and H36A and N37A lie in the NSP7-NSP12 interface. Of the NSP8 residues previously mutated 8 and visible in the structure, four were detrimental to polymerase function. Mutation of NSP8 P183A results in the mutation of a cis-proline residue and may result in an NSP8 folding defect. The three remaining mutated NSP8 positions make important contributions to interactions with NSP12 through the second subunit of NSP8 while these same NSP8 amino acid positions are distal to the observed interaction sites in the NSP7-NSP8 heterodimer. NSP8 D99A would disrupt an electrostatic interaction with NSP12 K332. P116 sits in a turn between two NSP8 helices and mutation to an alanine at this position may disrupt the ability of this loop to adopt the unique NSP12-bound conformation. Mutation of NSP8 R190A would disrupt the hydrogen bonding of R190 with carbonyls of NSP8 helix a.a 116-121 which may destabilize the unique conformation of this NSP8 region and prevent NSP12 binding. These previous mutagenesis studies validate the interfaces presented here and emphasize the importance of the observed interactions of NSP12 with NSP7 and NSP8.\n\nIn 3D classification of the SARS NSP12-NSP7-NSP8 complexes, we observed that a portion of the particles appeared to be missing the NSP7-NSP8 heterodimer. Further 3D sorting and refinement yielded a reconstruction at 3.5 \u00c5 resolution which largely resembles the larger complex ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ). However, in addition to missing the NSP7-NSP8 heterodimer, this structure also displays a significant amount of disorder in the fingers domain index and ring loops which play a role in template and NTP binding ( Fig  5) . We hypothesize that the binding of the NSP7-NSP8 heterodimer to the index finger loop stabilizes the polymerase domain to permit template recognition. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that while NSP12, NSP7 and NSP8 all individually recognize RNA with no or poor affinity, the complex of NSP12-NSP7-NSP8 is significantly more capable of binding RNA 8 .\n\nHere, we have described the 3.1 \u00c5 cryoEM structure of the SARS-CoV NSP12 polymerase bound to NSP7 and NSP8 co-factors resolving 123 kDa of the 160 kDa complex. The NiRAN domain of NSP12 presents a conserved face for interaction with the N-terminal disordered domain. Structural homology of NSP12 to the polymerases of the picoronavirus family suggests residues involved in template recognition and catalysis. The role of NSP7 and NSP8 heterodimer appears to be the stabilization of NSP12 regions involved in RNA binding while a second subunit of NSP8 also plays a crucial role in polymerase activity possibly by extending the template RNA binding surface.\n\nA search for structural homology with SARS-CoV NSP12 NiRAN domain using the DALI server 37 , revealed significant structural homology to protein kinases (Supplementary Fig 6) . The homologous region spans the C-terminal large kinase domain, with the closest structural homology residing in the kinase nucleotide-binding site. Though kinase activity has not been demonstrated for NSP12, there are several overlapping kinase catalytic residues visible in the SARS-CoV NSP12 NiRAN structure including Asn209 and the nidovirus conserved Asp218 and Phe219. As the NSP12 N-terminus is disordered, we are unable to determine if this region of NSP12 resembles the small kinase domain. However, the shared residue identities with the large kinase domain do suggest a potential nucleotide binding site within the NSP12 NiRAN domain. How such a kinase-like domain carries out the previously reported nucleotidyltransfer 10 remains a subject for further study.\n\nViral co-factors NSP7 and NSP8 have been established as being essential for a highly active NSP12 polymerase complex. While the majority of NSP7 could be resolved in this structure, the Nterminal regions of both NSP8 are disordered in agreement with previous observations and predictions 15, 38 . Given the large number of other viral NSPs and RNA that have been assigned to contact NSP8, we speculate that these disordered N-terminal regions may act as molecular handles for recruiting additional viral factors and organizing the viral replication complex.\n\nThe coronavirus NSP12 polymerase structure, presented here, fills a gap in our current understanding of coronavirus non-structural proteins involved in RNA synthesis. These viral NSPs form a large multi-subunit complex, but how this complex is assembled around the key RNA polymerase active site has until now remained unclear. This model of NSP12 bound to NSP7 and NSP8 is the first step towards unraveling the assembly and activity of this viral macromolecular complex with key implications .
