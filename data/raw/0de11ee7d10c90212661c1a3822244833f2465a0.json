{"title": "A cascade reaction network mimicking the basic functional steps of acquired immune response", "body": "Introduction antibodies and immunological memory, but also cell-mediated responses, including the key steps of antigen presentation, antigen binding, co-stimulation and destruction of the foreign body (phagocytosis). More broadly, a network of specialized cells, tissues and organs work together to recognize, respond and remember specific antigens or pathogens. Functionally, each step in the sequence of humoral and cellular immune response involves the activation and deployment of B and T lymphocytes via highly complex signaling pathways. A fully implemented artificial AIS has not been well studied, possibly resulting from the difficulty of controlling programmability and transferring the high-level biological codes into simple artificial modules and physical implementations. In addition, the formation of robust molecular structures and precise control of their temporal dynamics may be other difficulties. However, in the present work, we have hypothesized the feasibility of designing a network of reactions able to function in a manner similar to the vertebrate acquired immune system, using DNA and enzyme as simplified artificial analogs to mimic the activation and deployment of acquired immune response at its most fundamental level.\n\nThis study reports the step-by-step construction of such a prototype, termed hereinafter as Adaptive Immune Response Simulator, or AIRS. We first asked what building materials would best replicate the intricate networks of chemical reactions and signaling pathways, as well as cell-cell communication, that control host immunity. 1 As a carrier of genetic information with well-regulated and predictable structures, DNA offers an excellent platform for the design of reaction networks with arbitrary topologies and high programmability. 2, 3 Building on the richness of DNA computing 4, 5 and DNA-enzyme manipulation, 6, 7 synthetic DNA-based systems have been used to explore the possibilities of mimicking both simple and complex systems. For example, small-scale in vitro circuits encoding elementary functions, such as cascades, 8 bistable memory, 9, 10 or oscillations, 11 have successfully been engineered. In addition, larger networks, including those that mimic neural networks 12 or predator-prey ecosystems, 13, 14 confirm the value of DNA chemistry for implementing the type of system proposed in this study.\n\nPathogenic challenge results in the production of antibodies that lock onto a part of the foreign body known as an antigen. Since this event triggers a complex cascade of cellmediated reactions, we next asked what bioengineering techniques would best replicate the intricate networks of chemical reactions and signaling pathways, as well as cell-cell communication, which control host immunity. To address both questions, in a stepwise manner, we report the construction of a chemical reaction network, termed AIRS, that couples DNA-enzyme cascade interactions, as described above, with DNA strand displacement cascades in which a new product can be activated by the presence of specific initiators 15, 16 , thus allowing many such reactions to be linked into a cascade and even to form a complex network, in particular one such as adaptive immunity where biological events follow each other sequentially in a rolling fashion.\n\nOnce a foreign target has crossed the threshold of immune tolerance, the humoral and cellular components of the vertebrate immune system are called to action. A key function is antigen presentation which provides the mechanism for recognition and response. While B cells secrete antibodies, which bind to and tag an antigen, T cells perform the job of attacking target cells. Both T and B cells also have roles in forming memory cells. As shown in Figure 1 , we divided this series of events into three steps, including Recognition and Tolerance, Immune Response, and Killing and Memory, under the control of four functional DNA components, including DNA duplexes AM (Antigen Presenting Cell (APC) Mimicry), BM (B Cell Mimicry), PG (Primer Generator, which generates primers for analog antibody) and single-stranded circular DNA CT (Circular Template, which controls the sequence of analog antibody), as well as two enzymes (Phi29 DNA polymerase and SsPI restriction enzyme) able to autonomously and programmably respond to an incoming piece of singlestranded DNA pathogen input (P 0 ) taken from bacterial genome. When no P 0 is present, the system is maintained in a steady, balanced state by effective blocking of the functional domains in each component. However, when challenged by P 0 , these functional domains are activated in a series of steps designed to mimic the three steps noted above.\n\nIn step 1, in the absence of P 0 , the functional components of the system remain in stasis. Mimicking immune tolerance, the unresponsive state of immune defense, the reaction priority of P 0 to duplex DNA AM, as well as to BM, is controlled through the lengths of their corresponding toeholds, which are short single-stranded DNA overhang segments in duplexes. Accordingly, we designed a 10-nucleotide (nt) toehold in AM with a displacement reaction rate k of 10 6 M \u22121 s \u22121 and a 0-nt toehold in BM with a k value of 10 3 M \u22121 s \u22121 for initial P 0 hybridization. 17, 18 AM can display P 0 , which has two ssDNA domains, one having a sequence taken from the genome of Bacillus anthracis, a Gram-positive, rodshaped bacterium (P), and the other designed (ssDNA domain 2-3-4) for controlling downstream reactions through a DNA displacement reaction. However, at the recognition and tolerance phase, our system can only proceed to step 2, immune response, when the amount of pathogen accumulated exceeds the threshold of AM.\n\nOnce the threshold of immune tolerance is reached in the system, step 2, analog humoral immune response, is activated. As previously noted, during the depletion of AM by displacement reaction, one of the displaced products, ssDNA TM (T Cell Mimicry), accumulates and can be used as a catalyst to increase the reaction rate between P 0 and BM, thus releasing a primer (ssDNA domain 12a), for DNA polymerase-catalyzed rolling cycle amplification (RCA), which this system will employ to produce DNA \"antibody\" mimicry (P*) to the antigen B. anthrasis (P). Thus, to replicate host defense immune response, we incorporated two B. anthracis genomic sequence fragments (P) in the circular template (CT), resulting in rapid generation of the complementary sequences P*, essentially by enzymatic amplification, using Phi29 DNA polymerase, the replicative polymerase from the Bacillus subtilis phage phi29, and deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP), to mimic the fast and antibody-specific generation naturally produced by B cells.\n\nIn step 3 of the proposed system, killing and memory, it was necessary to mimic the process by which cell-mediated immune response eliminates pathogens, following the formation of antibody-antigen complex from the body, which, as noted above, results from activation of humoral immune response by the activation of B lymphocytes. To accomplish this, three infectious states were assumed: original pathogen strand P 0 and displacement reaction products (with AM and BM) P 1 and P 2 . Together, these all contain infectious pathogen domain (P). Then, to form the antibody-antigen complex in the system, the P domain in P 0 , P 1 and P 2 hybridizes with a large amount of P* and forms stable duplex regions PP*. However, while the vertebrate host immune system uses phagocytosis as a key strategy in removing pathogens, we designed a purely biomechanical method to mimic activation of humoral immune response, i.e., the binding between generated P* and P domain from the pathogen, followed by a restriction enzyme-based step that mimics cell-mediated killing by specifically cutting the \"antibody-antigen\" duplex. More specifically, this latter step is accomplished when the hybridization of P domain with P* creates an active recognition site for restriction enzyme SsPI, which is extracted from an E. coli strain that carries the cloned and modified (Y98F) SspI gene from the Sphaerotilus species restriction site. In this way, P domain in P 0 , P 1 and P 2 can be specifically cut into two fragments with the nucleotide numbers 56 and 15, 19 thus losing infectivity.\n\nNext, in the adaptive immune system, some T and B cells will become memory cells able to \"remember\" specific pathogens. These memory cells will trigger much faster immune response upon subsequent exposure to the same pathogen. Therefore, to create a mechanism to mimic the memory function of B cells, we turned to ssDNA TM, which is produced by the displacement reaction between P 0 and AM and remains in the system from the first exposure to P 0 . We also described its catalysis of P 0 and BM displacement to release primer quickly, thus triggering a faster RCA reaction creating antibody for the next exposure to the same pathogen sequence. This reaction is defined as entropy-driven because it is one that spontaneously evolves towards thermodynamic equilibrium ( Figure S7 ). 18 Without TM, the displacement rate between P 0 and BM would be slow by the effective blocking of active domains on BM. However, in the presence of TM, BM can hybridize with TM through its 4-nucleotide toehold (domain 5*) and then release ssDNA side product W 1 , resulting in a new toehold binding region (domain 3*) for the hybridization between P 0 and BM, which is driven forward thermodynamically by the entropic gain of the liberated molecules. Thus, the effect of memory is produced by speeding up the reaction rate between P 0 and BM by using the catalytic effect of remaining TM produced by the initial recognition. Thus, by leaving TM as \"catalytic fuel\" in the system, memory effect for a specific pathogen input is achieved.\n\nTo ensure proper operation of the entire network, signal transduction at each step was validated separately. To examine the precision of the threshold function of AM, we used a F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based method to study the hybridization order of P 0 with AM and BM. A fluorophore (FAM) and quencher (DABCYL) pair was coupled in the PG duplex to indicate the released amount of primer for RCA reaction. Fluorescence restoration only occurs if the threshold level of AM is exceeded, after which the reaction proceeds to step 2, immune response, based on strand displacement reactions that can release the quencher-labeled primer strand. Therefore, in the presence of 80 nM AM, 100 nM BM and 100 nM fluorophore/quencher-labeled PG, different concentrations of P 0 (from 0 nM to 150 nM) were introduced to the system with fluorescence monitoring at 517 nm. As shown in Figure 2A , the fluorescence restoration exhibited a sharp upturn at the P 0 concentration of 80 nM, but little increase while under 80 nM, indicating that the reaction between P 0 and BM had begun at the depletion point of AM. In other words, the threshold value of AM to P 0 is adjustable by changing the concentration of AM. In this case, the depletion point, or threshold level, of AM was reached at 80 nM, indicating that the reaction between P 0 and BM could initiate step 2, which, in human, is the production of antibodies by B lymphocytes. To further confirm this result, fluorescence kinetics of the above system was monitored. Initially, 80 nM AM, 100 nM BM and 100 nM PG were mixed in the buffer, and a small amount of P 0 (30 nM) was added. Because of the excess amount of AM and its reaction priority to P 0 by the requirements of step 1, slow fluorescence restoration kinetics occurred. However, when more P 0 (30 nM each time) was continuously added to the system, a sharp increase (after 90 nM in total) was seen in the fluorescence kinetics, indicating that the reaction could proceed to step 2. Different threshold values were tested by changing the concentrations of AM and BM (Fig. S1 ). Gel electrophoresis was also used to indicate the order of reactions (Fig. S2 ). Since the same recognition domain (2-3-4) is shared, similar experimental results were also observed by substituting P 0 for another pathogen sequence, P 0 -SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus genomic DNA and Fig. S3 ). All assays confirmed the effective threshold function of AM relative to the reaction between BM and P 0 , thus providing a macroscopic mimicry of the \"recognition and tolerance\" state of AIS.\n\nAnother significant function of AM is to produce catalytic ssDNA TM to facilitate the hybridization reaction between P 0 and BM, which, according to Zhang et al. 18 , can accelerate the hybridization reaction by two to four orders of magnitude. It will be recalled that ssDNA TM is not only important in facilitating the hybridization between P 0 and BM, but it is also key to the formation of \"mimetic memory cells.\" Therefore, to prove the catalytic effect of TM, we continued to use our FRET-based reporting model, as described above. Accordingly, 80 nM AM, 100 nM BM, and 100 nM FAM/DAB-labeled PG were incubated in buffer. Afterwards, 150 nM P 0 were added to the system. It should be noted that we used an excess amount of P 0 to AM in order to overcome the threshold value. TM is generated in step 1 as a result of the reaction between P 0 and AM. Thus P 0 , when it exceeds the threshold, as set by controlling the concentration of AM, in turn results in a catalytic reaction between excess P 0 and TM by entropy that can quickly restore the fluorescence of the system. As a comparison, the same concentration of P 0 was directly added to a solution with 100 nM BM and 100 nM FAM/DAB-labeled PG, but no AM. As shown in Figure 2C , measurements of the fluorescence kinetics of the catalyzed reaction exhibited over 500-fold acceleration in contrast to that without catalysis. 18, 20 Thus, as explained above, the released TM could serve as specific memory mimicry, resulting in a stronger and faster immune response for the next exposure to the same pathogen. Afterwards, we also confirmed that the quantity of P* generated from enzymatic amplification for hybridization with domain P in P 0 , P 1 and P 2 could be determined by the amount of primer, thus making the enzymatic reaction controllable by upstream reactions in steps 1 and 2 (see supplementary materials). In addition, the restriction enzyme-based digestion of the generated \"antigen-antibody\" complex was studied and shown in the supplementary materials.\n\nAfter confirming the proper function of each step, we further tested the performance of the entire system with the same pathogen strand input from the Bacillus anthracis genome (P 0 ). To confirm the tolerance of AIRS, a small amount of P 0 (100 nM) was then added to the system, and fluorescence was monitored in real time. We then designed a DNA molecular beacon (MB-R) to report the amount of RCA product fluorescently by using the pathogen B. anthracis genomic sequence P as its loop. MB-R could be opened by the RCA products, i.e., P*, thereby exhibiting fluorescence restoration that represents different amounts of P*. It can be observed from Figure 3A that the fluorescence kinetics is similar to that without P 0 , confirming that the system is not activated to produce P* when the amount of pathogen is under the level of immune tolerance (i.e., threshold of 200 nM). However, when another 150 nM P 0 were added to the system to mimic a second exposure to the same pathogen, the fluorescence restoration showed much faster kinetics behavior, indicating the production of a large amount of P* and successful triggering of immune response. In addition, the faster response during the second exposure also confirmed the memory effect of this system for specific pathogen. If P 0 -SARS is used as a pathogen input and a molecular beacon (MB-R-SARS) encoded with SARS genomic DNA (P 0 -SARS) is used as reporter, similar fluorescence response trends are seen, as shown in Figure 3B , indicating that AIRS potentially works for a second pathogen input. We also used a different fluorescence reporting system to indicate the amount of generated P*, which is shown in the supplementary materials (Fig. S10) .\n\nUsing a fluorescence reporter in independent experiments, AIRS was demonstrated to operate equally well with two different pathogen inputs. Therefore, we next studied if it could also work when two different inputs were presented simultaneously. To make this determination, P 0 and P 0 -SARS were introduced together to the solution containing all components (300 nM AM, 300 nM BM, 300 nM PG, 50 nM CT-P 0 , 50 nM CT-P-SARS, 0.5 U/ul Phi29 and 250 uM dNTP). As in the experiment above, two different molecular beacons with the same fluorophore and quencher (MB-R and MB-R-SARS) were also added to the mixture to report the amounts of both RCA products fluorescently, i.e., P* and P*-SARS. As shown in Figure S14 , as long as both pathogen inputs are under the level of immune tolerance (threshold of 300 nM), AIRS is not activated and fluorescence remains unchanged compared to the background signal. However, when the concentrations increase to a level higher than threshold for either one, or both, pathogens, fluorescence is restored, indicating that both pathogen inputs can generate corresponding antibody mimicry when they are mixed together. This confirms that AIRS has the capacity to respond simultaneously to two different pathogen inputs.\n\nTo further characterize error-free operation of the AIRS system, we used gel electrophoresis to analyze the final amount of P*. As shown in Figure 4A , only one sharp high molecularweight band can be seen when the amount of pathogen exceeds the threshold level (100 nM +150 nM), which is consistent with the previous fluorescence result. To study the binding between pathogen input strand (P 0 ) and antibody mimicry strand (P*) in step 3, we modified P 0 with a fluorophore (FAM). After the generation of P*, the hybridization between P 0 and P* was confirmed to be present, as a high molecular weight band could be seen in the FITC imaging channel (Fig. S13) . With further addition of more FAM-labeled P 0 (from 1 \u00d7 to 250 \u00d7 excess) to the system, the hybridization between excess P 0 and generated P* was still observed, indicating that AIRS could sufficiently bind excess pathogen input strand (P 0 ) by RCA. Finally, we incubated SsPI restriction enzyme (2 U/\u00b5L) together with all other components (200 nM AM, 200 nM BM, 200 nM PG, 50 nM CT, 0.5 U/\u00b5L Phi29 and 250 \u00b5M dNTP). After introducing excess concentration of FAM-labeled P 0 (500 nM) to surpass the immune tolerance of the system, the digestion fragment band with FAM modification (56 nt) was discovered under the FITC channel, leading to the conclusion that the pathogen had been successfully digested (Fig. 4B) . Interestingly, if P 0 is substituted by a doublenucleotide polymorphism input P 0 -mis, antibody mimicry P* can still be generated with excess concentration of P 0 -mis. However, the hybridization between P 0 -mis and P* cannot be digested by the SsPI restriction enzyme, demonstrating that the AIRS system is sensitive to recognition of nucleotide polymorphism of the pathogen input (Fig. S11 ). AIRS has been designed with two layers of selectivity, making it possible for the system to differentiate P 0 from double-nucleotide polymorphism input P 0 -mis. To explain, the relatively weaker binding ability between P 0 -mis and P*, when compared to that of P 0 and P*, makes the P 0mis -P* duplex less stable. Additionally, P 0 -mis-P* mismatch duplex cannot form an effective recognition binding site with the restriction enzyme SsPI (AAT-ATT), thereby reducing the enzyme's digestion rate, which, in turn, results in much less cleavage product from input P 0 -mis (Fig. S11) . In contrast, because the hybridization of P 0 -SARS with P* creates a recognition binding site identical to that of restriction enzyme SsPI, similar gel electrophoresis results were found (Fig. 4C) , again confirming that AIRS can work for different pathogen inputs.\n\nFinally, as noted above, the specificity of the system mainly depends on the restriction enzyme and sequence of CT (Supplementary Materials). If we challenged the system by introducing FAM-labeled P 0 -SARS as the pathogenic input, but CT for B. anthracis as amplification template, no obvious high-molecular weight fluorescent band appeared with either small or large amount of P 0 -SARS under FITC channel by the lack of hybridization between P 0 -SARS and P* specifically generated for B. anthracis (Fig. S12 ).\n\nWe began by hypothesizing the feasibility of designing a network of chemical reactions able to function in a manner similar to the vertebrate acquired immune system, using DNA-DNA and DNA-enzyme interactions as simplified artificial analogs to mimic the macroscopic behaviors of the vertebrate adaptive immune system. Accordingly, the designed artificial acquired immune response simulator, or AIRS, was de novo demonstrated to superficially mimic three basic steps of host immune response, including recognition/tolerance, immune response, and killing/memory, but without the presence any living component to achieve functionality. Moreover, even though the designed system is entirely synthetic, biocompatibility was shown by its ability to of using only biological molecules (DNA/ enzyme). Consequently, since the cellular state can be controlled by DNA or RNA, it could be possible to encode cellular functions to the system output (i.e., DNA/RNA strand), 5, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] making it possible to scale up this prototype to increasingly intelligent molecular nanocontrollers and nano-operators. However, to achieve that, our current construction design will need to be improved and integrated with other chemistries.\n\nA 7.2 \u00b5L sample of 20 \u00b5M CT (with phosphate group on its 5 prime end) was placed in 4 \u00b5L CircLigase II 10\u00d7 Reaction Buffer containing 330 mM Tris-acetate (pH 7.5), 0.66 M KAc, 5 mM DTT and 2.5 mM MnCl 2 . Afterwards, 2.8 \u00b5L CircLigase II (Epicentre, Madison, WI) was mixed with the buffer and diluted to 40 \u00b5L with water. The mixture was incubated at 60\u00b0C for 3 hours. Then 20 U Exonuclease I and 200 U Exonuclease III (New England Biotech, Ipswich, MA) were added to the mixture and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. The enzyme was denatured by heating up the solution to 90\u00b0C for 20 minutes. Finally, the CT product was purified by denatured PAGE and desalted with NAP-5 columns.\n\nWhen the reaction priority between Step 1 and Step 2 was tested, purified AM (50 nM), BM (50 nM) and PG (with FAM and DAB, 50 nM) were mixed in 1\u00d7TAE-Mg buffer to the total volume of 100 \u00b5L, and the fluorescence was monitored in different concentrations of P 0 (or P 0 -SARS or P 0 -mis) (Fig. S1 ). Fluorescence intensities were tested after incubation for 1 hour at room temperature. When the signal transduction in the entire system was tested by Working principle of the Acquired Immune Response Simulator. AIRS consists of consists of three steps: (I) Recognition and Tolerance, (II) Immune Response and (III) Killing and Memory. These functions are blocked in the absence of ssDNA pathogen (P 0 ) input, but once P 0 is introduced to the AIRS system, it is driven by a series of DNA toehold-mediated strand displacement and DNA-enzyme reactions. Colored lines indicate DNA strands with different domains. All \u00d7 domains are complementary to x*; P 0 is the pathogen sequence which possesses infection ability in ssDNA form. AM (Antigen Presenting Cell (APC) Mimicry), BM (B cell Mimicry), and PG (Primer Generator, which generates primers for analog antibody) are initially present as duplex components, along with circular DNA template CT (Circular Template, which controls the sequence of analog antibody) and two functional enzymes: Phi29 polymerase and SsPI restriction enzyme. TM is T Cell Mimicry and RCA is rolling cycle amplification. Validation of signal transduction in entire AIRS mimicry network by Fluorescence. P 0 : ssDNA pathogen taken from the genome of Bacillus anthracis; P-SARS: ssDNA pathogen taken from the genome of SARS. P*: complementary sequences of P 0 . P*-SARS: complementary sequences of P-SARS. MB-R and MB-R-SARS are molecular beacon reporters for P 0 and P-SARS. Fluorescence kinetics of antibody mimicry P* (P*-SARS) generation was monitored with different concentrations of P 0 (a) and P 0 -SARS (b). Here we used double amounts of the individual DNA components compared to those used for data shown in Figure 2 to ensure that the concentrations would be consistent with the following gel experiment."}
