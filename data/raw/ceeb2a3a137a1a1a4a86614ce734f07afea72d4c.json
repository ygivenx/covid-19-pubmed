{"title": "The Sustained Value of an Early Pregnancy Assessment Clinic in the Management of Early Pregnancy Complications: A 10-Year Retrospective Study", "body": "Results: There were 11 349 new referrals and 10 764 follow-up visits. The reasons for referral were threatened miscarriage (n = 3568, 31.4%), missed miscarriage (n = 3056, 26.9%), incomplete miscarriage (n = 1064, 9.4%), complete miscarriage (n = 991, 8.7%), ectopic pregnancy (n = 857, 7.6%), hyperemesis gravidarum (n = 139, 1.2%), and others (n = 1674, 14.8%). There has been a significant decreasing trend (tau = \u22120.60, P = 0.0127) and a significant decrease in the post-EPAC rate of ER reassessments (P = 0.0396) for hemorrhage, with a concomitant decrease in EPAC visits for hemorrhage. In addition, there has been a significant increasing trend (tau = 0.64, P = 0.0081) and a significant increase in the post-EPAC rate of ER assessments (P = 0.00001) for ectopic pregnancies.\n\nConclusion: Over the 10-year period, the EPAC has remained a vital service for managing early pregnancy complications for women. However, the clinic has not yet had a sustained impact on ER visits for miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, and hemorrhage. It is possible that a reduction in ER assessments and reassessments for early pregnancy complications can be achieved through a clinic with daily access.\n\nObjectif : Cette \u00e9tude visait \u00e0 \u00e9valuer la valeur \u00e0 long terme d'une clinique d'\u00e9valuation pr\u00e9coce de la grossesse (EPAC) dans la prise en charge des complications en d\u00e9but de grossesse ainsi que l'incidence sur les visites aux urgences. The causes of early pregnancy loss include fetal chromosomal abnormalities, maternal conditions, intrauterine infections, maternal-fetal incompatibilities, and unknown causes. 1 The early pregnancy assessment clinic (EPAC) model has been shown to provide improved efficiency and quality of care in the management of early pregnancy complications. 3 EPACs are not common in Canada; however, they are becoming increasingly popular. In Vancouver, British Columbia, patients reported satisfaction with the emotional support and care provided at an EPAC, 4 and in Halifax, Nova Scotia, an early pregnancy complications clinic provides care to women with early pregnancy losses. 5 An EPAC at North York General Hospital in Toronto, Ontario was established in August of 2005. The clinic continues to serve women from anywhere in central Toronto and the greater Toronto area of Ontario. The model of the clinic was described in our previous study in 2009. 6 Since then the hours of the clinic have remained the same, and over 20 000 visits were made between August 2005 and 2015. The aim of the present study was to assess whether the EPAC has had a sustained impact over the 10 years of the study period on the management of early pregnancy complications and on the number of assessments and reassessments in the emergency room (ER).\n\nThe clinic data from the EPAC database and patients' records from Powerchart between January 2006 and December 2015 (years 1-10) were reviewed. The number of women assessed, the sources of referral, the reasons for referral, the final diagnoses, and the treatments provided at the clinic were analyzed. The total number of ER visits per year, the number of initial consultations, and repeat assessments within 30 days for abortion, hemorrhage, and ectopic pregnancy were obtained from the health records department. The ER data were obtained between January 2004 (year \u22121) to December 2005 (year 0) before and just after the opening of EPAC (pre-EPAC) and between January 2006 and December 2015 (years 1-10) after the opening of EPAC (post-EPAC). The classification of these selected pregnancy-related complications determined on the basis of ICD 10 classification: abortion/miscarriage (codes 002 and 003), early pregnancy hemorrhage (code 020), and ectopic pregnancy (code 000). The code 020 for early pregnancy hemorrhage includes threatened abortion and other hemorrhage in early pregnancy.\n\nER assessment and reassessment rates of each early pregnancy complication (miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, and hemorrhage) were calculated by setting the denominator as the child-bearing (aged 15 to 49) female population in each corresponding year. This population was used because of the lack of availability of data on pregnant women population sizes. The child-bearing female population statistics for the catchment area of the hospital (previously described) were obtained from the Census Program of Statistics Canada, 7 \n\nAn exploratory data analysis was conducted on both ER assessment and ER reassessment data sets by calculating the assessment and reassessment rates for each of the three early pregnancy complications.\n\nNext, the difference between the average pre-EPAC and the average post-EPAC ER assessment and reassessment rates for each early pregnancy complication was tested by a chi-square test.\n\nFinally, because of limited pre-EPAC data, a rank-based nonparametric Mann-Kendall test 8-10 was used to detect monotonic trends in rates of ER assessments and reassessments for miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, and hemorrhage since the implementation of the EPAC. The Mann-Kendall test was applied specifically to test the data against a null hypothesis of no monotonic trend against an alternative hypothesis of downward monotonic trend between 2005 and 2015 (years 1-10).\n\nAll statistical and graphic analyses were performed using R statistical software version 3.3.3 (The R Project for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria; www.r-project.org/). The trend analysis was conducted by the package \"trend\" in R to detect trends in assessment and reassessment rates over 10 years. Graphs were made using the library ggplot2 (www.ggplot2.org). Statistical significance was decided at a 5% significance level.\n\nThe study was approved by the Ethics Review Board of North York General Hospital, a community hospital affiliated with the University of Toronto. The trends in EPAC visits for early pregnancy complications during the 10-year period are shown in the Figure. There has been an increasing trend in the number of EPAC visits for miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy since the opening of the clinic, whereas there has been a decreasing trend in the number of visits for hemorrhage. \n\nThe numbers of ER assessments and reassessments for these early pregnancy complications are shown in Table 2 . During the 2 years before the establishment of the EPAC (pre-EPAC: year \u22121 to year 0), there was a total of 126 540 ER visits, of which 1897 visits were for hemorrhage, 899 were for miscarriage, and 118 were for ectopic pregnancy. There were 599, 162, and 39 ER reassessments for these diagnoses, respectively. During the 10-year period after the opening of the EPAC (post-EPAC: years 1-10), there was a total of 850 051 ER visits, of which 10 262 visits were for hemorrhage, 5818 were for miscarriage, and 1413 were for ectopic pregnancy. There were 2610, 935, and 335 ER reassessments for these diagnoses, respectively.\n\nThe incidence rates of ER assessment and reassessment rates for miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, and hemorrhage between 2004 and 2015 (during the pre-EPAC and post-EPAC periods) are presented in Table 3 .\n\nThe average rates of ER visits for early pregnancy complications compared between the pre-EPAC and post-EPAC periods are presented in Table 4 . There was a significant \n\nincrease in the post-EPAC rate compared with the pre-EPAC rate of ER assessments for miscarriage (P = 0.0016) and ectopic pregnancy (P = 0.00001). There was no significant difference in the post-EPAC and pre-EPAC rates of ER assessment for hemorrhage.\n\nThere were also no significant differences in the post-EPAC and pre-EPAC rates of ER reassessments for miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. Conversely, there was a significant decrease in the average rate of post-EPAC reassessments for hemorrhage compared with pre-EPAC reassessment (0.17 vs. 0.21, P = 0.0396).\n\nThe results of the trend analysis of ER assessments and reassessments for early pregnancy complications since the opening of the EPAC are presented in Table 5 . There was a significant increasing trend in the percentage of ER assessments for ectopic pregnancy and a non-significant increasing trend in the percentage of ER assessments for miscarriage. There were increasing trends in ER reassessments for miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy that were nonsignificant. There was a significant decreasing trend in ER reassessments for hemorrhage (tau = \u22120.60, P = 0.127) and a non-significant decreasing trend in ER assessments for hemorrhage.\n\nEarly pregnancy complications occur in about 15% to 20% of all pregnancies, 1,2 and they can result in significant psychiatric morbidity. 11 After a miscarriage, women can experience increased anxiety, which can persist for several weeks after the pregnancy loss, 11 and they can also experience emotions of grief, dysphoria, and guilt. 12 Often women experiencing a miscarriage receive care in the ER, where they frequently can be faced with long wait times and fragmented care from several health care providers. 13 These women can also feel that their experiences of loss are not adequately acknowledged in the ER and that there is a lack of clear discharge education and follow-up instructions, all of which can leave them feeling marginalized. 14 Despite this, the ER remains the first contact for these women.\n\nIt has been shown that patient satisfaction with the medical care received after a miscarriage is improved when there is a follow-up appointment soon after the loss, with sufficient time to discuss patients' feelings and questions. 12 EPACs provide a resource for women to receive treatment for pregnancy complications, as well as the appropriate follow-up appointments, thus enhancing the efficiency and quality of care provided. 3 In addition, several studies have shown that the implementation of an EPAC can significantly reduce the admissions rate for early pregnancy complications from the ER. [15] [16] [17] [18] However, there are fewer studies exploring the effect of the EPAC model of care on the number of assessments and reassessments in the ER for early pregnancy complications. An Australian study found that following the Sustained value of early pregnancy assessment in management of early pregnancy complications -10-year retrospective establishment of an early pregnancy problem service clinic, there was a significant reduction in the median length of stay in the ER for women experiencing pain or bleeding in early pregnancy; however, there was a non-significant reduction in the proportion of assessments and reassessments in the ER. 19 Another study found that implementing the use of a gynaecology outpatient clinic decreased the proportion of ER assessments for miscarriages from 31% in 2001 to 17% in 2009. 20 Our study showed that throughout a 10-year period, the EPAC has continued to provide care to women with early pregnancy complications; however, there has not been an impact in reducing the number of ER assessments and reassessments for miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. The significant decreasing trend seen in the percentage of ER reassessments for hemorrhage is likely not a result of the EPAC because there was a concomitant decrease in EPAC visits for hemorrhage during the same period.\n\nThe increase in ER assessments and reassessments for miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy is mirrored by an increase in EPAC clinic visits for these conditions. Therefore, the EPAC is continuing to manage these early pregnancy complications successfully in response to population trends and needs. However, it is speculated that the lack of impact on ER visits could reflect the clinic's limited hours of operation, which has remained unchanged since its implementation at 3 half-days a week. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in the United Kingdom recommended that early pregnancy units should be easily accessible and available to patients on a daily basis during the normal working week for the service to be effective. 21 There are several limitations to our study. When analyzing the pre-EPAC data, we were able to obtain data only from 1 year (2004) before the implementation of the EPAC, for two reasons: First, the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System coding that we used to extract ER early pregnancy complications data was not implemented until April 2002. Second, in 2003, as a result of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, the number of ER visits was significantly low during the summer months; therefore, the 2003 data were not used in our analysis. The limited pre-EPAC data reduced the effectiveness of evaluating the sustainability of EPAC (comparing pre-EPAC with post-EPAC average ER visit rates) and also restricted the use of more appropriate statistical analysis such as an interrupted time-series analysis. If there had been more pre-EPAC data, it is possible that different trends may have been seen in ER visits for early pregnancy complications. Because of these limitations, a Mann-Kendall test was used to detect any monotonic trends in ER assessment rates and reassessment rates for early pregnancy complications after the EPAC opened. Furthermore, covariates such as patients' age, GA, infections in pregnancy, education, and socioeconomic status were not included in the trend and pre-EPAC vs post-EPAC analyses. These covariates may affect the number of ER assessments and reassessments. In addition, we did not have a link between the ER data and the EPAC data to determine whether patients seen in the ER were being followed up in the EPAC.\n\nWe hope that in the future, with expanded clinic operating hours, the EPAC will go beyond providing care for women and will represent an improved efficient pathway in the management of early pregnancy complications and in reducing the ER workload. Our study demonstrates the value of providing standardized care for women undergoing early miscarriage through the implementation and funding of EPAC models where one-stop comprehensive care can be offered. We hope that the findings of our study will inform stakeholders and policy makers in making the care of women undergoing early pregnancy loss a priority in Ontario and in Canada as a whole.\n\nhelping to facilitate the funding.
