During proteinase-inhibition experiments, proteinase inhibitors were added to the media 1 hr before the addition of radiolabel. During pulse-label and pulse-chase experiments, synchronization of translation was achieved by the addition of NaCl (200 mM) to the media for 30 min at 5.5 hr p.i. (Denison et al., 1992) . The high-salt medium was replaced with isotonic medium containing [ 35 S]Met, and polypeptides were labeled for various times from 15 to 120 min. The infected monolayers were then harvested or alternatively chased with excess cold methionine for an additional 90 min.\n\nWe raised antisera directed against the MHV 3CLpro by immunizing rabbits with a keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)-linked oligopeptide or a fusion protein within the 3CLpro region of gene 1 (Fig. 1) . A synthetic 19-aminoacid oligopeptide ( 3426 -LQNPNTPKYSFGVVKPGET-3444 ) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline and coupled to KLH (Sigma) using glutaraldehyde.

Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by fluorography.\n\nRecombinant plasmids were transcribed and translated in vitro, as previously described (Lu et al., 1995) . Standard reactions were performed in a total volume of 25 ml, with 0.5 mg of plasmid DNA and 20 mCi of [ 35 S]Met (Amersham) for 90 min at 30\u040a. Reactions were terminated by addition of 21 Laemmli buffer or quick freezing in dry ice/ethanol and storage at 070\u040a.\n\nDBT cells were infected with MHV-A59 at an m.o.i. of 20 PFU/cell. At 6 to 8 hr postinfection, nonradiolabeled whole-cell lysates (4 1 10 6 cells) were immunoprecipitated with antiserum Sp9 or preimmune serum from the same rabbit. The pGpro construct, which expresses an active proteinase, was translated in vitro without radiolabel for 1 hr, and translation products were immunoprecipitated with antiserum Sp9. Immunoprecipitation products were separated on a 5-18% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel that was prerun with 0.1 mM thioglycolate in the upper running buffer (100 V, 15 min). The 27-and 32-kDa bands from pGpro translation were located by comparison with prestained protein markers and radiolabeled pGpro translation products, and were excised from the gel. The 27-kDa bands from IP of infected cell lysates inhibited, proteinase inhibitors such as 2 mM PMSF, 100 mg/ml E64c (Sigma), or 1 mM ZnCl 2 (zinc chloride; Sigma) were added into the mixtures containing radiolabeled additional 120 min at 30\u040a.

A third set of infected cell monolayers was used as controls for specificity. Major processed polypeptides of 32 and 27 kDa were expressed from pGpro radiolabeled for 60 min, and translation was terminated with cycloheximide followed by additional incubation for in vitro, as previously described (Lu et al., 1995) . Both the 32-and the 27-kDa proteins were detected by B3 up to 3 hr (pulse-chase). The variable pulse/constant chase experiment (Fig. and Sp9 antisera (Fig. 2) . Both antisera also precipitated products of greater than 200 kDa that were not detected 3B) demonstrated that radiolabel was incorporated into p27 between 60 and 75 min after initiation of translation. by preimmune sera.

Thus p27 appeared to be cleaved (27 kDa) as the in vitro cleavage product. The intracellular p27 was not detected in mock-infected cell lysates, nor soon after synthesis in infected cells. In contrast, the cleavage of p27 during in vitro translation of the pGpro was it precipitated from infected cells by preimmune serum.

We are currently using the Sp9 times p.i. p27 was first detected at 6-8 hr postinfection, (Fig. 2) .

The p27 protein from lysates of 1 1 10 5 cells was easily detected by fluorography of SDS Inhibition of p27 processing in cells gels within 12 hr. An additional faint band of approximately 27 kDa was visible during every labeling period We next investigated whether p27 processing in cells could be blocked by proteinase inhibitors. Infected DBT from 0 to 12 hr, from B3-precipitated, mock-infected cell lysates and in infected cells precipitated by preimmune cells were radiolabeled in the presence of leupeptin, PMSF, E64d, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), or ZnCl 2 , and cell lysates serum, suggesting that it was probably a cell protein that comigrated with the MHV p27.\n\nwere immunoprecipitated with Sp9 antiserum. Both serine and cysteine proteinase inhibitors affected proteolytic processing of p27 in DBT cells during MHV infection (Fig. 4) . p27 processing and stability in MHV-infected cells Leupeptin, PMSF, and NEM all consistently inhibited p27 processing between 50 and 85%, whereas E64d inhibited We next sought to determine whether p27-containing precursors could be identified, and to assess the stability processing 100%.

PMSF completely inhibited p27 cleavage activity, compared with the partial inhibition seen in virusinfected cells. E64c completely inhibited cleavage activity of p27, similar to the result obtained in virus-infected cells. E64c is the active form of E64 to which E64d is converted on entry into cells. The lowest concentration of E64c used (100 mg/ml or 300 mM) was 25% of that required to inhibit cleavage of p27 in cells, indicating that the proteinase was more sensitive to inhibition by E64 than previously thought. Zinc chloride inhibited proteolytic activity of p27 isolated from virus-infected cells, but did not inhibit activity of p27 isolated from in vitro translation products of pGpro. The reason for this was not clear, but was compatible with the less consistent results of ZnCl 2 inhibition seen in virus-infected cells. drophobic domains, as previously described (Lu et al., 1995) .

Since only the pGproG41 mechanism of cleavage of the 3CLpro early in infection, translation products were labeled, the new p27 molecules were the result of trans cleavage by the nonlabeled p27 proteins in the gel slices. In contrast, when pGproG41 IVT products were incubated with gel fragments containing the 27-kDa region proteins obtained by immunoprecipitation of infected cells by preimmune serum, no cleavage of p27 was observed (lane 2). Together these results demonstrated that the proteolytic activity was specific to the 27-kDa protein precipitated When proteinase inhibitors were incubated with the active proteinases. In addition, purification of the 27-kDa proteins by immunoprecipitation and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis did not eliminate their ability to process other molecules of p27 in trans.

However, the proteinase We have identified the active 3C-like proteinase molecules expressed from MHV-A59 ORF 1a in vitro and in activity was not purified from the cell lysates in either of these studies. Our approach allowed us to demonstrate virus-infected cells.

The MHV 3CLpro has been pre-coronavirus proteinase. The p27 protein precipitated from MHV-infected DBT dicted to span amino acids from S 3334 to Q 3635 , and to have a mass of 34 kDa (Gorbalenya et al., 1989a,b ; Lee cells was relatively abundant.

MHV p27 was detected in cells We have not determined the reason for the discrepancy between the observed and predicted masses of beginning at 6 hr postinfection, similar to the other MHV gene 1 products identified in virus-infected cells. This the MHV 3CLpro. Gel analysis may underestimate the molecular mass of proteins, especially if the protein is also was distinct from the results obtained with the HCV-229E 3CLpro, which was detected at earlier time points, not completely denatured, or if the protein binds a disproportionately large amount of SDS with a concomitant but declined at later times p.i.
