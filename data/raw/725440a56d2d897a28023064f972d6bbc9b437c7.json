{"title": "Supplemental Information The Intracellular Cargo Receptor ERGIC-53 Is Required for the Production of Infectious Arenavirus, Coronavirus, and Filovirus Particles", "body": "Analysis of Host Protein Partners, and Additional Viral GPs that Associate with ERGIC-53, Related to Figure 1 (A) Workflow for identification of human proteins that associate with the GPs encoded by LCMV and ANDV. HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding each respective viral GP with a C-terminal HA epitope tag and a biotin acceptor peptide (BAP), along with a second plasmid that encodes BirA, a bacterial biotin ligase, to ensure biotinylation of the viral GPs. As a control, cells were co-transfected with the BirA plasmid and an empty vector.\n\nTwo days later, biotinylated GPs and associated host proteins were affinity purified (AP) from whole cell lysates using magnetic streptavidin beads and separated on 4-20% polyacrylamide gels for Coomassie staining. To determine the identity of cellular proteins captured, each Coomassie-stained gel lane was cut into sections (see dashed lines) for in-gel, tryptic digestion and mass spectrometry analysis as described in the Extended Experimental Procedures.\n\n(B and C) Cut maps of the affinity purified LCMV GP (B) and ANDV GP (C) samples following SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining.\n\n(D) NIH DAVID functional clustering identifies enriched protein functional categories from proteomic datasets representing proteins identified binding to both LCMV and ANDV GP proteins, LCMV GP alone, or ANDV GP alone. Official gene symbols (see Tables S1A-S1C) of these data sets were entered into NIH DAVID, searched under medium stringency choosing Homo sapiens as background. Functional clusters showing four-fold or more increases were chosen for display here. Functional clusters were simplified by providing labels 1-14 above (see Table S1D for details). The percent of proteins (average of functional cluster subsets) in each data set in each of these categories is provided as well as the relative enrichment of a given cluster relative to the human proteome. Note that one protein may be found in more than one category. Also note that because the size of each dataset is different a category may show a higher percentage, but a lower enrichment when compared to the same category in a different data set.\n\n(E) HEK 293T cells were transfected with the BirA plasmid and a modified pCAGGS plasmid encoding WWAV GP with a C-terminal HA epitope tag and BAP or, as a control, an empty pCAGGS plasmid. Whole cell lysates (input) were collected 2 days later and incubated with streptavidin beads to isolate each biotinylated GP species (GPC and GP2). Input lysates and captured bead fractions were screened for GP species (GPC and GP2) (bait) and ERGIC-53 (prey) via Western blot.\n\n(F -I) HEK 293T cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding the indicated viral GPs with a C-terminal HA epitope tag or an empty plasmid. Two days later ERGIC-53 was immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates (input). Inputs and immunoprecipitated bead fractions were screened for ERGIC-53 (bait) and the various GP species (GPC and GP2 for arenaviruses; G2 for hantaviruses) (prey) via Western blot. (B) Overexpression of WT ERGIC-53 enhances infectious JUNV release (related to Figure 2B ). HEK 293T cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding Myc-tagged, WT ERGIC-53 or, as a control, an empty plasmid; 48 hr following transfection these cells were challenged with JUNV C#1 at an MOI of 0.1. Supernatants and cell protein lysates were collected at 24, 48, and 72 hr pi and screened for JUNV C#1 PFU via plaque assay and Myc-ERGIC-53 or CRT (loading control) via Western blot (each lane represents an individual well). Data are presented as mean PFU \u00b1 SEM relative to the empty vector transfected wells and are the summation of 2 independent experiments (n = 6 per time point).\n\n(C and D) Restriction of ERGIC-53 to the ER impairs the release of infectious JUNV C#1 and DANV (related to Figures 2C and 2D , respectively). HEK 293T cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding Myc-tagged DN ERGIC-53 or, as a control, an empty plasmid; 24 hr later cells were challenged with JUNV C#1 (C) or DANV (D) at an MOI of 0.1 or 0.001, respectively.\n\nSupernatants and cell protein lysates were collected at the indicated times pi and screened for lane represents an individual well). Data are presented as mean PFU \u00b1 SEM relative to the empty vector transfected wells and are representative of 2 independent experiments (n = 12 or n = 6 per experiment for JUNV C#1 or DANV, respectively).\n\n(E) Release of infectious JUNV C#1 is impaired in ERGIC-53 (LMAN1 -/-) null cells (related to Figure 2E ). B cells from LMAN1 +/+ (2829-D) and LMAN1 -/-(CRC-78 and CRC-79) individuals were challenged with JUNV C#1 at an MOI of 1. Supernatants and cell protein lysates were collected at 48 and 72 hr pi and screened for JUNV C#1 PFU via plaque assay and ERGIC-53 or actin (loading control) via Western blot (each lane represents an individual well). Data are presented as mean PFU \u00b1 SEM relative to the LMAN1 +/+ cells and are representative of 2 independent experiments (n = 3 per condition per experiment).\n\n(A -E) *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, determined using the unpaired Student's t test. (A) Depiction of ERGIC-53 mutants used in this study. ERGIC-53 is a nonglycosylated, type I transmembrane protein that forms homohexamers and consists of an ER-lumenal domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain (for review see (Hauri et al., 2000) ). The ERlumenal portion of the protein contains a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) that selectively binds high mannose glycans in a Ca 2+ -and pH-dependent manner (Appenzeller-Herzog et al., 2004; Appenzeller et al., 1999; Itin et al., 1996) . Lectin binding can be disrupted by deletion of the entire CRD (\u2206CRD) (residues 44 -269) or specific \u03b2-strands within the CRD (e.g. strands 1 & 2 (\u2206\u03b22) (residues 43-72), 1 through 3 (\u2206\u03b23) (residues 43 -76), or 1 through 4 (\u2206\u03b24) (residues 43-83)) (Zheng et al., 2010) , or through mutation of individual amino acids (N156A or D181A) (Itin et al., 1996; Velloso et al., 2003; Zheng et al., 2010) within the CRD that are critically required for coordinating Ca 2+ -binding. The ER-lumenal region of ERGIC-53 also encodes an alpha helical domain and two cysteine residues (C466 & C475) that are all required for the formation of ERGIC-53 homohexamers. Deletion of the helical domain (\u2206Helix) (residues 271 -457) (Neve et al., 2005) or mutation of the cysteine residues to alanine \n\n(C466A/C475A) (Nufer et al., 2003) results in the loss of noncovalently-associated or disulfidelinked homohexamers, respectively. Deletion of the helical domain combined with mutation of C466 and C475 to alanine (\u2206helix monomer (\u2206HM)) (Zheng et al., 2010) completely abolishes ERGIC-53 oligomerization and yields monomeric ERGIC-53, which, like the DN mutant (KKAA) (Kappeler et al., 1997) , cannot traffic beyond the ER. Additionally, several of these constructs (\u2206CRD, \u2206\u03b21, \u2206\u03b22, \u2206\u03b23, \u2206\u03b24, and \u2206HM) abolish ERGIC-53's ability to interact with MCFD2 (Zheng et al., 2010) .

JUNV C#1, which is an attenuated vaccine strain, was originally derived from WT JUNV strain XJ and differs by 12 amino acids (Chosewood et al., 2009; Goni et al., 2006) . Working stocks of infectious JUNV C#1 and DANV were generated in Vero E6 cells. Infectious titers of these viruses were determined via plaque assay on Vero E6 cells. VSV\u0394G encoding a GFP reporter has been described elsewhere (Takada et al., 1997) and was provided by M. Whitt (The University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN). An infectious stock of VSV\u0394G pseudotyped with VSV G was generated by first transfecting HEK 293T cells with a pCAGGS plasmid encoding VSV G and then 24 hr later inoculating these cells with infectious VSV\u0394G (which had previously been pseudotyped with VSV G) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3. Supernatants were collected 24 hr following inoculation and infectious titer was determined by enumerating green foci via focus assay in Vero E6 cells.\n\nTo identify and/or validate the interaction of human proteins, including ERGIC-53, with various viral GPs in Figures 1, 3 , 6, S1, and S6, we subcloned each respective viral GP into our previously described pCAGGS expression vector (Cornillez-Ty et al., 2009 ). This vector expresses each GP as a fusion protein containing 3 C-terminal elements: a hemaglutinin (HA) epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA) followed by the tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavage site (ENLYFQG) followed by a 23 amino acid biotin acceptor peptide (BAP) (MASSLRQILDSQKMEWRSNAGGS). When co-transfected with a second plasmid that encodes the bacterial biotin ligase BirA, the BAP can be biotinylated for affinity purification with streptavidin beads. GPs were subcloned into this vector using Gateway Technology (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, each GP was first amplified via PCR using forward and reverse primers containing attB1 and attB2 sequences, respectively. In each case, the stop codon was excluded. PCR products were subcloned into pDONR221 via a BP recombination reaction. GP genes were then subcloned from pDONR221 into the modified pCAGGS vector via an LR recombination reaction. The nucleotide sequence of each GP clone was verified by DNA sequencing. GPs were subcloned from the following viral strains (for each GP, an NCBI Gene Identifier number and a Protein Locus number are listed to provide a link to the actual nucleotide sequence cloned for that particular GP and the corresponding translated amino acid sequence, respectively): ANDV strain CHI-7913 (30313864, AAO86638), SNV NMR11 (999407 (note that there are two silent mutations in our clone: G changed to T and A changed to C at positions 60 and 843, respectively, of referenced sequence), AAC42202), LASV strain Josiah (23343509, NP_694870), LCMV strain Armstrong 53b (61655715, AAX49341), JUNV strain XJ (also referred to as Parodi) (see (Reignier et al., 2006) for description of the nucleotide sequence; the amino acid sequence of the cloned gene matches JVU70799), JUNV strain C#1 (52222815, AAU34180), MACV strain Carvallo (see (Reignier et al., 2006) for description of nucleotide sequence, the amino acid sequence of the cloned gene matches \n\nTo capture biotinylated viral GPs for the identification of human protein partners via mass spectrometry ( Figures 1A, 1B , S1B, and S1C) or validation of protein partners via Western blot ( Figures 1D, 1F , 1G, and S1E), HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with our modified pCAGGS plasmid that encodes each respective viral GP with a C-terminal HA epitope tag and a BAP, and a second plasmid that encodes BirA to facilitate biotinylation of the viral GPs. As a control for the mass spectrometry studies and APs done to validate an interaction between a given viral GP Western blot analysis to confirm bait/prey purification or Coomassie staining for mass spectrometry analysis (described in next section).\n\nTo identify human protein partners of LCMV GP or ANDV GP in Figures 1A, 1B , S1B, and S1C, HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with our modified pCAGGS plasmid encoding each respective viral GP with a C-terminal HA epitope tag and a biotin acceptor peptide (BAP) and a second plasmid encoding BirA to ensure biotinylation of the viral GPs. As a control, cells were co-transfected with the BirA plasmid and an empty vector. Two days later, biotinylated GPs and associated host proteins were affinity purified (AP) from whole cell lysates as described above, in an LTQ-XL linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) over the entire run using 10 MS/MS scans following each survey scan. Raw data were searched against the human IPI forward and reverse concatenated databases using SEQUEST software requiring tryptic peptide matches with a 2 Da mass tolerance. Cysteine residues were required to have a static increase in 71.0 Da for acrylamide adduction, and differential modification of 16.0 Da on methionine residues was permitted. Host proteins were considered legitimate GP protein partners if 2 or more unique tryptic peptides were detected from a host protein in samples transfected with a given GP plasmid but not the empty vector or, alternatively, if there was a 5-fold higher quantity of total tryptic peptides detectable from a given human protein in a GP sample compared to the empty vector sample. These filters resulted in a false discovery peptide rate of less than 1%.\n\nImmunoprecipitations above in the \"Affinity Purification of Viral GPs\" section. Following centrifugation at 10,000 rpm at 4\u00b0C to remove insoluble material, protein lysates were pre-cleared by incubating them with magnetic Protein G beads (Dynabeads Protein G beads, 10004D, Invitrogen) on a rotating platform for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Each cleared lysate was then incubated (on a rotating platform) with its respective antibody for 2 hr followed by magnetic Protein G beads for 1 hr. The beads were then washed 4 times with ice cold lysis buffer to remove nonspecific proteins and excess antibody. Captured bait proteins and their associated protein partners (prey) were stripped from the beads by boiling them in Laemmli buffer (with or without 5% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol) and\n\nseparated by size and charge on gradient Novex 4-20% Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gels for\n\nWestern blot analysis to confirm bait/prey purification. Immunoprecipitations from cellular protein lysates were carried out using the following antibodies: ERGIC-53 was immunoprecipated with either the mouse anti-ERGIC-53 G1/93 antibody (ALX-804-602-C100, Enzo Life Sciences Farmingdale, NY) ( Figures 1E, 1I-1K , 3F, 3H, 3J, S1G and S1H) or a rabbit anti-ERGIC-53 antibody (sc-66880, Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX) ( Figure S1F and S1I); VSV G with the mouse anti-VSV G antibody (11 667 351 001, Roche Applied Science) ( Figure 3E ); JUNV GP with the mouse anti-GP1/GPC antibody GB03-BE08 (NR-2564, BEI Resources) ( Figure   1H ); or, as a control, a species matched, non-immune Mouse IgG1 Isotype (MAB002, R&D Systems Minneapolis, MN) ( Figures 1K and S1H ).\n\nTo purify intact JUNV C#1 particles in Figure 5D , supernatant from JUNV C#1-infected Vero E6 cells was collected 72 hr post-inoculation, cleared of cells by centrifugation at 1400 RPM, then pre-cleared with magnetic Protein G beads, incubated with the GP1-specific mouse monoclonal antibody QC03-BF11 (NR-2566, BEI Resources) for 2 hr followed by magnetic Protein G beads for 1 hr. The beads were washed 4 times with PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 1 mM calcium chloride and then boiled in Laemmli buffer to elute/lyse the captured viral particles.\n\nThe collected lysate was then electrophoresed on a Novex 4-20% Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel for Western blot analysis. Controls for this experiment included the use of the GP1-specific antibody with supernatants from mock-infected cells as well as using the MAB002 Mouse IgG1\n\nIsotype Control antibody for immunoprecipitation from the JUNV C#1-infected supernatants. with JUNV C#1 at an MOI of 0.1. Supernatants were collected 96 hr post-inoculation, concentrated via ultracentrifugation as described below, and screened for PFU via plaque assay, JUNV proteins (GP1, NP, and Z) or cellular proteins (ERGIC-53 and actin (loading control)) via\n\nWestern blot, and viral S segment genomic RNA via quantitative RT-PCR (as described below).\n\nRNA was extracted from each viral preparation using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (52906, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer instructions. Virion preparations were also screened for their ability to bind host cells in a virus-cell binding assay (described below).\n\nTo determine whether the viral particles produced in EBV-immortalized B lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from a normal (LMAN1 +/+ ; 2829-D) or ERGIC-53 null (LMAN1 -/-; CRC-78)\n\nindividual had differing capacities to bind host cells in Figure 4G , we chilled Vero E6 cells grown in 48-well plates to 4\u00b0C, washed them twice with PBS, and then incubated duplicate wells with each viral preparation for 1.5 hrs at 4\u00b0C. Unbound virus was then aspirated and each well was washed 3 times in PBS. Following the final wash, total RNA was extracted from each monolayer using the RNeasy Mini Kit (74106, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer instructions. RNA samples were then subjected to quantitative RT-PCR, as described below, to determine the copies of JUNV C#1 S segment genomic RNA.\n\nTo enumerate quantities of JUNV C#1 viral S segment genomic RNA, cDNA was generated using 200 nM of primer 5'-AAGGGTTTAAAAATGGTAGCAGAC-3', which is specific for the NP region of the S segment genomic (negative-sense) RNA, with Multiscribe-RT (4311235, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Reaction conditions were 25 o C for 10 min, 48 o C for 30 min, and 95 o C for 5 min. Quantitative PCR was then performed using a primer-probe set originally described in (Trombley et al., 2010) . Specifically, we used forward primer ( StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System and analyzed with the provided StepOne software.\n\nFor the VLP assays shown in Figure 4C , HEK 293T cells were initially transfected with a plasmid expressing Myc-tagged WT or DN ERGIC-53, then 24 hr later with a cocktail of 2 plasmids encoding the JUNV Z and XJ GPC proteins, respectively, to permit the formation and release of VLPs. Cells and supernatants were collected 72 hr later and screened for the presence of various GP species (the C-terminally FLAG-tagged precursor GPC or proteolytically processed GP2) or actin (to serve as a loading control) via Western blot. Cells were collected as described above in the \"Viral Challenge Assay\" section. VLPs were concentrated from supernatants via ultracentrifugation through sucrose (as described below) prior to Western blot analysis.\n\nThe JUNV VLPs in Figure 4C and JUNV C#1 particles in Figure 4D were concentrated via ultracentrifugation through sucrose as previously described (Neuman et al., 2008) . Briefly, supernatants were clarified of cellular debris via 2 rounds of centrifugation at 1500 rpm and 2500 rpm, respectively. VLPs/particles were then precipitated by dissolving polyethylene glycol MW 8,000 (81268, Sigma-Aldrich) into clarified supernatants (10% weight/volume) at 4 o C.\n\nSupernatants were then centrifuged at 10,000 RPM for 30 minutes at 4 o C to pellet VLPs/particles. Pellets were gently resuspended in HEPES buffered saline, pH 7.4, layered onto 20% sucrose, and centrifuged at 100,000 x g in a T-865 Rotor (Thermo Scientific) for 2.5 hr at 4 o C. Pelleted virus was gently resuspended in HEPES buffered saline, pH 7.4 for use in plaque and/or Western blot assays.\n\nConfocal Images for all confocal experiments were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 510 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope. Images were captured using either a 63X or 100X objective lens with a numerical aperture of 1.4. Optical zoom was set to 1.5X and images were obtained at 1.0 Airy unit. The colocalization analysis shown in Figure 1L was performed with the colocalization analysis module contained in the Zeiss Aim software on images that were captured using the 63X objective lens. To determine background gating thresholds for colocalization analysis, we averaged the background signal from triplicate images of either mock-infected cells stained using the GB03-BE08 mouse anti-JUNV GP1/GPC antibody directly conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 or JUNV C#1-infected cells stained with the Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (gates are shown as white lines in the histogram in Figure 1L ).\n\nFlow cytometry was utilized to screen, in cells expressing either WT or DN ERGIC-53, whether JUNV C#1 GP ( Figure 4B ) or hTfR1 ( Figure S4 ) was detectable at the plasma membrane and, if so, the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of these respective signals. In both cases, HEK 293T cells were seeded in 6-well dishes and transfected the next day with plasmids encoding either "}
