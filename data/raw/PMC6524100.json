{"title": "Perspectives in veterinary medicine: Description and classification of bronchiolar disorders in cats", "body": "Abnormalities of the bronchioles, defined as small airways <2 mm in internal diameter and lacking cartilage in their walls, result from a variety of pathologic processes and lead to a wide spectrum of clinical disease. Advances in understanding bronchiolar disorders in humans have been hampered by lack of a widely accepted classification scheme because of different viewpoints of clinicians, radiologists, and pathologists. In humans, bronchiolar disorders are classified by inciting cause (eg, infection, drug related, immune\u2010mediated, or occupational or environmental exposures), clinical sequelae (eg, restrictive, obstructive, or mixed disorders), imaging, histologic features, or some combination of these.11, 14, 15 Bronchiolar disease can be focal or diffuse, acute, or chronic, inflammatory or fibrotic, and confined to the lungs or develop as part of a variety of systemic diseases.8, 9 In primary bronchiolar disorders, disease centers on bronchioles and spares other parts of the respiratory tract. In secondary bronchiolar disorders, disease extends to small airways from either the large airways or pulmonary parenchyma (eg, interstitial lung diseases [ILDs]).10 Bronchiolar disorders, although recognized in humans, have not yet been described as distinct clinical entities in veterinary medicine.\n\nLower airway diseases of cats (eg, asthma, chronic bronchitis, parasitic bronchitis) are common, although lower airway disease has been considered a large (ie, \u201cbronchial\u201d) airway disorder. Extension of inflammation into the bronchioles, although at times recognized histologically,17 is not characterized clinically. Uncommonly recognized in cats, descriptions of ILDs infrequently mention bronchiolar involvement.18, 19 With increasing use of computed tomography (CT), abnormalities suggestive of bronchiolar disease are being identified in cats. Multidisciplinary input from clinicians providing detailed clinical descriptions, radiologists characterizing CT features, and pathologists documenting and describing bronchiolar lesions will be essential to develop a consensus classification.\n\nBronchiolar disorders may result from infection, environmental or occupational exposures, immunologically mediated disease, neoplasms, chronic aspiration, and drug\u2010induced toxicity, among other causes.20, 21, 22, 23 Although a description of each is beyond the scope of this article, a discussion of environmental bronchiolar disorders in humans appears relevant because cats and humans share their environment and potential exposures. Known or suspected exposures causing bronchiolar disorders in humans have been reviewed11 and include chemicals (eg, cleaning compounds, pesticides, artificial flavorings), inhalant particulates, animal or mineral dusts, and gas and smoke inhalation. Previously, environmental bronchiolar disorders were thought to be an acute sequela to a severe, overwhelming exposure, but more recently, disease with an insidious onset of clinical signs without a recognized overexposure event (perhaps representing cumulative smaller exposures) or a mild single exposure has been appreciated.24 Injury to bronchiolar epithelial cells leads to inflammation and a fibroproliferative repair response, ultimately resulting in mural fibrosis (constrictive bronchiolitis) or intraluminal fibrosis (proliferative bronchiolitis).25 Four histopathologic types of disease have been proposed: cellular bronchiolitis (inflammatory infiltrate of the bronchioles), constrictive bronchiolitis (concentric fibrosis of the wall leading to narrowed airway caliber), proliferative bronchiolitis (polyps of connective tissue within the bronchiolar lumen), and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (proliferative bronchiolitis with polyps extending into the alveolar ducts and alveoli).11\n\n\nCompared to humans, cats lack connective tissue septa in the lung outlining a secondary pulmonary lobule (Box 1). Furthermore, there is no distinctive recognizable pattern of analogous bordering venules and lymphatics arranged in discrete polyhedral shapes that might comprise this unit. Thus, even in disease, pathology on CT scans of cats would not reflect distribution around a pulmonary lobule. Terms used in imaging of human lung such as centrilobular, panlobular, interlobular, and intralobular are not appropriate descriptors in cats. Dogs are similar to cats and also lack secondary pulmonary lobules, and the pulmonary acinus has been suggested to be the important high\u2010resolution CT (HRCT) unit of the canine lung.26 The acinus is defined as the region of the lung supplied by a single terminal bronchiole, representing the smallest functional unit of the lung. Because it is smaller than the secondary pulmonary lobule that is the smallest visible structure on HRCT, we believe that the pulmonary acinus is not a replaceable term as the important HRCT unit of the feline (or canine) lung. Instead, descriptors of collective changes of multiple acini visible on HRCT will need to be developed and refined.\n\nThoracic radiography is insensitive for diagnosis of small airway (bronchiolar) disease, likely contributing to the absence of its recognition in clinical practice. Thoracic radiographs in humans with bronchiolar disease may be normal or show nonspecific changes such as hyperinflation, nodules, and reticular to alveolar infiltates.11, 21 In our experience, thoracic radiographs in cats with histologic evidence of bronchiolar disease can have bronchial or bronchointerstitial patterns (with or without bronchiectasis), patchy alveolar patterns, ill\u2010defined nodular opacities, and hyperinflation or hypoinflation. The radiographic appearance of histologically confirmed bronchiolar disease in cats does not present as a single pathognomonic radiographic pattern, but is highly variable, reflecting the different diseases encompassed in the spectrum of bronchiolar disorders. Importantly, without clinical recognition of these disorders, bronchiolar disease is not considered as a differential diagnosis. In humans, HRCT has been instrumental in improving diagnosis of bronchiolar disorders, establishing them as important disease entities in pulmonary medicine. With more commonplace use of CT in cats, we are recognizing some features similar to those described in humans. Paired inspiratory and expiratory scans and thin section reconstruction (0.625\u20102 mm slice thickness)27 provide optimal detail.\n\nNormal bronchioles in humans and cats are below the limits of resolution on HRCT, but with dilatation, mural thickening, and intraluminal plugging, small airways become visible.8 Bronchiolar disorders have characteristic HRCT features, classified as direct or indirect signs.8, 28 Direct signs imply a change in the walls or lumens of bronchioles resulting in an ability to visualize them. These signs include centrilobular nodules (humans only), tree\u2010in\u2010bud pattern (nodular opacities connected to branching linear structures originating from a single stalk reflective of impacted debris, cells, or fluid within bronchioles), peribronchiolar ground glass opacity or consolidation, and dilatation (bronchiolectasis).5, 14, 27 Indirect signs reflect changes to the pulmonary parenchyma distal to the diseased bronchiole and include mosaic attenuation (because of air trapping) or, in the setting of bronchiolar disorders, rarely mosaic perfusion.27 Because air trapping may be imperceptible on inspiratory images, expiratory scans are crucial to accentuate air trapping.8 Direct findings reflect inflammation or proliferative changes within the bronchiolar lumens, whereas indirect findings reflect fibrosis within the bronchiolar wall (eg, constrictive bronchiolitis).8\n\n\nDefinitive confirmation of bronchiolar involvement requires histopathology. The microscopic anatomy of bronchioles is similar between humans and cats. Distal bronchioles are lined by simple cuboidal epithelium supported on a thin lamina propria and surrounded by smooth muscle. Airways end as respiratory bronchioles before the alveolar parenchyma in the cat (Figure 1) and in humans. Microscopic morphology has been used to categorize lesions as inflammatory or fibrotic, recognizing there are a limited number of ways airways respond to injury.9 Inflammatory or cellular lesions often are subcategorized as acute, chronic, acute on chronic, granulomatous, or eosinophilic. Fibrotic lesions reflect the site affected (intraluminal or intramural); overlap in inflammatory and fibrotic changes can be noted within the same patient.9 Multiple wedge biopsy specimens are recommended to capture patchy and sometimes subtle lesions.29 A particular histologic pattern of disease may have a wide variety of causes. For example, inflammatory bronchiolitis can be caused by infection, aspiration, transplant rejection, and extension from large airway disease or systemic collagen vascular disease, among other causes.9 Fibrosis may be a sequela to chronic inflammation so that in end\u2010stage disease, the inflammatory etiology can be missed. Thus, classification schemes based solely on histopathologic features are likely to be less clinically useful, and multidisciplinary input should be sought to allow meaningful interpretation of histologic findings. This should not dampen enthusiasm for the central role of histopathology in an understanding of bronchiolar disorders. In fact, in humans, histopathology may be the only means to document bronchiolar disease in the subset of symptomatic patients with normal lung function (as assessed by spirometry, diffusion capacities, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing) and normal HRCT scans.30\n\n\nIn humans, bronchiolar disorders often have distinct historical data, clinical presentations, CT findings, and histopathology. Our proposed scheme, adapted for cats, is based on a state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art review of bronchiolar disorders in humans that focuses on discrete clinical syndromes supported by distinct CT imaging patterns and histopathologic features.10 Of note, this scheme is not universally accepted, and there are other proposed schemes biased by specialty, in particular pathology.9\n\n\nPrimary bronchiolar disorders in humans encompass disease in which the pathologic process is limited to bronchioles.10 They are distinct from secondary disorders in which extension to bronchioles occurs from large airway disease or from ILD. Analogous disorders occur in cats and will require further efforts among veterinary clinicians, radiologists, and pathologists for full characterization. Herein, we describe a series of clinical cases in cats with small airway disease using a modification of the aforementioned classification scheme adopted from usage in humans (Table 1). Protocols for thoracic CT and histologic examination are provided in Supporting Information 1 and 2.\n\nAlthough this suggested classification scheme is a starting point for cats, it will need modification as awareness of bronchiolar disorders in cats increases and cases are investigated prospectively. Additionally, it is critical to realize that veterinarians are likely to detect bronchiolar disorders late in the disease course for several reasons: (i) cats hide respiratory disease well, (ii) aggressive diagnostic testing, including lung biopsy, is rarely advocated unless underlying disease is serious and there are potentially treatable differential diagnoses, (iii) serious disease is associated with anesthetic risk, and (iv) advanced diagnostic tests are expensive. Detection of end\u2010stage lesions will not provide much needed clues about common underlying etiologies because the inciting factor may be gone, and there are likely many insults that share a final common pathway with similar clinical, physiological, and histologic appearances.25 At the present, we believe that CT provides the best minimally invasive antemortem evidence of bronchiolar disease in cats. Importantly, histopathologic correlates will be required before CT alone can be considered a less invasive surrogate diagnostic test.\n\nA 7\u2010year\u2010old female spayed (FS) domestic shorthair (DSH) cat had been treated over a 10\u2010month period by a primary veterinarian for intermittent and progressive labored respiration. The cat was 1 among 50 cats housed in a double\u2010wide trailer. Potential inhalant exposures included particulates from clumping cat litter and concentrated bleach used for cleaning. The owner herself recently had been diagnosed with small airway disease. Thoracic radiographs showed hyperinflation, a diffuse bronchial pattern, a multifocal unstructured interstitial pattern with progression toward an alveolar pattern, lung atelectasis, subpleural thickening, and bronchiectasis and bronchiolectasis in peripheral opaque regions (Figure 2 A, B). The cat did not respond to multiple courses of antibiotics or antifungal drugs but had a partial clinical response to prednisolone. The cat died and was submitted for necropsy. Grossly, the lungs were hyperinflated. Histologically, mixed chronic inflammation involved the pulmonary interstitium and was especially prominent in subpleural areas (Figure 2 C). Respiratory bronchioles were obliterated by loose fibrous tissue (Figure 2 D). The lesions noted in this cat represented a spectrum of early (markedly inflammatory) and late (predominantly fibrosis) foci. Furthermore, although distribution was centered on small airways reflective of a primary bronchiolar disorder, there was extension into the interstitium with a subpleural distribution. Important considerations for discriminating primary bronchiolar disorders like CBO from secondary bronchiolar disorders are noted in Box 2.\n\nA 5\u2010year\u2010old male castrated (MC) DSH cat was presented for evaluation of chronic cough and 1 week of tachypnea. Its environment was exclusively indoors with clumping clay cat litter noted as a potential inhalant exposure. Physical examination identified increased bronchovesicular sounds with a respiratory rate of 70 breaths per minute. Thoracic radiographs disclosed a moderate diffuse bronchointerstitial pattern, patchy areas of unstructured to structured (with ill\u2010defined contours) interstitial pattern, and repeatable hypoinflation on all views (Figure 3 A, B). On echocardiography, no evidence of pulmonary hypertension was found. On thoracic CT, multifocal subpleural linear opacities, parenchymal bands, and bronchiolectasis with no air trapping on expiratory breath\u2010hold images were observed (Figure 3 C, D). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cytology identified 45% nondegenerate neutrophils, and aerobic and anaerobic cultures were negative. Lung biopsy (Figure 4 A\u2010C) disclosed marked inflammation within and around terminal and respiratory bronchioles, with most severe inflammation in subpleural regions. Away from the severe fibrosis and inflammation, inflammation was centered upon respiratory bronchioles. Many of these bronchioles were lined by hyperplastic epithelium and surrounded by thickened smooth muscle. Rarely, small numbers of acicular particles suggestive of mineral origin were noted in macrophages and epithelial cells (not shown). Additional comments regarding mineral dust airway disease are presented in Box 3.\n\nA 15\u2010year\u2010old FS DSH cat was presented for fever, anorexia, and lameness of 2 weeks' duration. Physical examination disclosed a respiratory rate of 120/min, increased bronchovesicular sounds, and thickened bowel loops. Diagnostic test results included pancytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypoalbuminemia, normal total T4 concentration, negative status for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and heartworm antigen, but positive results for feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), normal neurologic and ophthalmic examinations, and a diffuse bronchointerstitial pattern on thoracic radiography. A CT scan of the thorax showed a diffuse tree\u2010in\u2010bud pattern and mosaic attenuation (Figure 5A\u2010C); abdominal CT was unremarkable. Cytology of BAL fluid indicated 66% nondegenerate neutrophils, 30% macrophages, and 4% lymphocytes. Many Histoplasma capsulatum organisms were observed within macrophages. Treatment was not pursued. Diseases with similar CT patterns are described in Box 4.\n\nA 13\u2010year\u2010old FS domestic longhair cat was presented for chronic productive cough and gagging especially pronounced after eating and drinking, intermittent vomiting and anorexia, and regurgitation. On physical examination, a grade III/VI parasternal heart murmur was heard, respiratory rate was increased (60 breaths per minute), and body condition score was 3/9. A diffuse bronchointerstitial pattern was observed on thoracic radiography. Computed tomography was suggestive of DAB with a multifocal distribution of lesions (Figure 6 A\u2010D). Specifically, nodules of similar size were equally spaced from each other and, when in the periphery, were at the same distance from the pleural surface, consistent with affected small airways. Bronchoalveolar lavage cytology was unremarkable. Cough improved after treatment with omeprazole. Histologic evaluation of tissue was not performed. However, the supportive clinical history, including conditions predisposing to repetitive microaspiration, the bronchiolocentric CT lesions, and subsequent improvement in clinical signs after a trial of omeprazole, supports presumptive DAB.\n\nA 7\u2010year\u2010old FS DSH cat was presented for potential mammary tumors. The cat had lived in South Korea for 2.5 years until 9 months before presentation. The cat had been treated for psychogenic alopecia with megestrol and methylprednisolone acetate and subsequently developed mammary masses. Relevant history included exposure to \u201cyellow dust\u201d in South Korea, a serious environmental health threat affecting air quality and leading to respiratory disease in humans. Additionally, 10 months prior, the cat sustained inhalational injuries from a house fire. No abnormalities were found on CBC, serum biochemical profile, and urinalysis, and the cat tested negative for FIV, FeLV, and heartworm. On thoracic radiography (Figure 7 A\u2010C), a severe bronchial pattern leading to multifocal patchy areas of increased opacity was observed. In some areas, the soft tissue opacities appeared as nodules with ill\u2010defined borders. Abdominal CT was unremarkable. On thoracic CT, randomly distributed soft tissue attenuating pulmonary nodules of variable sizes, bronchial wall thickening, and areas of complete opacification were identified (Figure 7 D\u2010F). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cytology identified 1906 cells per microliter with 63% nondegenerative neutrophils, 23% small lymphocytes, 12% macrophages, and 2% eosinophils, and no neoplastic cells or organisms were seen. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were negative. Histopathology of biopsy specimens of the mammary masses indicated mammary hyperplasia. Thoracotomy with left caudal lung lobectomy subsequently was performed. Histopathology (Figure 8 A,B) identified severe inflammation (lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes) within the terminal and respiratory bronchioles and surrounding alveoli, and large cuffs of perivascular inflammation. The large area of complete opacification on the CT scan comprised confluent inflammation, and the smaller nodules on CT corresponded to affected small airways on histopathology. Immunohistochemistry for coronavirus was negative. Trichrome staining identified minimal fibrosis of alveolar walls; periodic acid\u2010Schiff staining was positive in smooth muscle of respiratory bronchioles. Immunohistochemistry performed to identify CD3+ T cells, CD80+ B cells, and E\u2010cadherin showed a mixed population of cells consistent with inflammation. Polarized light failed to identify particulates. Owners were instructed to bring the cat back for baseline pretreatment thoracic radiographs after healing from the thoracotomy and before starting immunosuppressive doses of glucocorticoids. They were unable to do so until 10 weeks postoperatively. At that time, evaluation of thoracic radiographs indicated dramatic improvement of previously documented lesions in the absence of any treatment (Figure 9 A,B). It was unclear if this improvement was a result of spontaneous remission or waxing and waning disease. Other primary bronchiolar variants are described in Box 5.\n\nA 7\u2010year\u2010old FS Ocicat was presented with a 5\u2010year history of asthma. Diagnosis was based on clinical signs (cough and wheeze), negative fecal and heartworm antigen and antibody testing, lack of response to doxycycline and fenbendazole, serial thoracic radiographs showing a moderate to severe diffuse bronchial pattern and collapse of the right middle lung lobe (Figure 10 A,B), and a BAL finding of eosinophilia. A CT scan performed under sedation 2 years previously was compatible with both large and small airway disease (Figure 10 C\u2010E). The cat's clinical signs were managed with prednisolone and terbutaline until 6 years of age, at which time the cat was refractory to higher doses of glucocorticoids. The cat ultimately was euthanized and histopathology identified severe lymphocytic, plasmacytic, and eosinophilic bronchitis and bronchiolitis with bronchiectasia, goblet cell hyperplasia, severe peribronchitis, and arteriolar smooth muscle hypertrophy.\n\nA 5\u2010year\u2010old FS DSH cat was presented for chronic cough. No abnormalities were noted on physical examination except obesity. Thoracic radiography disclosed a mild diffuse bronchointerstitial pattern. A trial of fenbendazole did not resolve the cough. Thoracic CT identified wall thickening of segmental and subsegmental bronchi, nodular appearance to the bronchovascular bundle with occasional tree\u2010in\u2010bud pattern, and partial or complete atelectasis of the caudal segment of the left cranial, right cranial, and right middle lung lobes. The central and dependent portions of the right cranial lung lobe were consolidated with visible air bronchograms (Figure 11 A\u2010E). Cytology of BAL fluid identified 70% eosinophils. Serum allergen\u2010specific IgE testing to aeroallergens identified multiple strong positive reactions. Given the severe changes noted in the right cranial lung lobe, which could not easily be ascribed to asthma, lobectomy was performed. Histology identified mild to moderate eosinophilic bronchitis and bronchiolitis with luminal mucus accumulation, moderate bronchial gland hyperplasia, mild subpleural air trapping consistent with asthma, but no evidence of an infiltrative disease was found (Figure 12). The cat initially was treated with PO, followed by inhaled, corticosteroids and a weight loss plan with marked clinical improvement.\n\nA 10\u2010year\u2010old DSH female spayed cat was presented for acute labored respiration. Prior respiratory signs included wheezing, coughing, and sneezing for 4\u20105 months. On physical examination, a respiratory rate of 90/min, increased bronchovesicular sounds and morbid obesity were observed. An echocardiogram identified normal left atrial size; a pro\u2010brain natriuretic peptide test was negative. On thoracic radiography, a mild to moderate bronchial pattern involving the caudal lung fields and right middle lung lobe atelectasis was observed. Thoracic CT with contrast identified a tree\u2010in\u2010bud pattern with regions of accentuation of mosaic attenuation on the expiratory series suggestive of air trapping (Figure 13 A,B). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cytology identified 36% nondegenerate neutrophils and 12% eosinophils, and aerobic and anaerobic cultures were negative. Because of a poor response to glucocorticoids, the owner elected euthanasia. Histopathology identified moderate to marked multifocal neutrophilic bronchial and bronchiolar inflammation (Figure 14A,B). Many neutrophils were present in the airway lumen, infiltrating the airway epithelium and extending beneath the submucosa to surround submucosal glands. There was moderate expansion of bronchial\u2010associated lymphoid tissue with mild to moderate inflammation within the lumen of affected bronchioles with large numbers of neutrophils extending into alveoli in some areas. Small numbers of affected bronchioles were surrounded by abundant inflammation and were markedly and concentrically decreased in diameter. The luminal epithelium of the affected bronchioles exhibited mild hyperplasia to squamous metaplasia (Figure14B). The final diagnosis was chronic bronchitis and bronchiolitis.\n\nA 17\u2010year\u2010old MC DSH cat was presented for chronic coughing and wheezing and chronic kidney disease. On physical examination, a body condition score of 3/9, grade II/VI parasternal systolic heart murmur, expiratory wheezes, and irregularly shaped kidneys were identified. Thoracic radiographs disclosed a severe diffuse bronchial pattern with subtle hyperinflation. Heartworm antibody and antigen testing was negative. There was no response to fenbendazole. Thoracic CT identified bronchial wall thickening and thickened bronchovascular bundles, bronchiolectasis, undulated pleural margins, right middle and accessory lung lobe atelectasis, and a tree\u2010in\u2010bud pattern (Figure 15 A\u2010G). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cytology identified 660 nucleated cells per microliter with 62% nondegenerate neutrophils. Empirical treatment with azithromycin and prednisolone was started. Respiratory signs stabilized, but the cat subsequently progressed to stage IV renal disease and the owner elected euthanasia. Histopathology (Figure 16A,B) identified multiple large bronchi moderately to markedly dilated and filled with neutrophils, macrophages, mucus, and amorphous cellular debris. A rim of inflammatory cells surrounded these airways. Lesions extended into terminal bronchioles the lumens of which were nearly obliterated by concentric submucosal fibrosis; less commonly these airways were completely replaced by loose connective tissue (Figure 16B). The final diagnosis was chronic bronchitis and constrictive bronchiolitis.\n\nA 1.5\u2010year\u2010old FS DSH cat was presented for chronic cough and increased respiratory effort. An inducible cough, increased bronchovesicular sounds, and respiratory rate of 64/min were noted on physical examination. Thoracic radiographs disclosed pulmonary nodules with cavitations and ill\u2010defined margins in the right cranial and both caudal lung lobes over a background of a diffuse moderate unstructured interstitial pattern, moderate bronchial pattern, and a focal alveolar pattern involving the right cranial lung lobe associated with mild rightward mediastinal shift (Figure 17 A,B). Testing for FeLV, FIV, and heartworm antibody was negative; titers for Toxoplasma IgM were negative and for IgG were positive at >1 : 2560 consistent with prior exposure. Inadequate feces were available for examination. Thoracic CT identified a large number of variably sized pulmonary nodules (many more observed than on 3\u2010view thoracic radiography) most having cavitations and with walls measuring 0.7\u20101.5 mm. Other lesions included bronchial wall thickening, thickened bronchovascular bundles, tree\u2010in\u2010bud pattern, mosaic perfusion, and bronchiectasis and bronchiolectasis among other findings (Figure 17 C\u2010E). On BAL fluid cytology, there were 1084 cells per microliter with 80% neutrophils. Culture was positive for 3 enteric bacteria. Pending test results, the cat was discharged on fenbendazole and praziquantel. Overnight, the cat's breathing was labored. The cat was re\u2010presented and a pneumothorax was ruled out by thoracic radiography. The cat failed to respond to dexamethasone and terbutaline, and euthanasia was elected. Necropsy confirmed pulmonary paragonimiasis with numerous bronchi and bronchioles being dilated and filled with degenerate neutrophils, necrotic cellular debris, fibrin, and ova.\n\nAdditional considerations regarding large versus small airway disease are provided in Box 6.\n\nA 6\u2010year\u2010old FS DSH cat was presented with chronic weight loss, cough, and respiratory distress. Thoracic radiography performed 6 months previously disclosed an unstructured interstitial pattern and a moderate bronchial pattern, more severe in the ventral thorax (Figure 18 A,B). Treatment for presumptive asthma with prednisolone and theophylline resulted in minimal response. On physical examination, respiratory rate was 128/minute and body condition score was 3/9. On thoracic CT, multifocal areas of consolidation with air bronchograms were observed, more severe in the ventral aspect of the thorax and at the periphery (Figure 18 C\u2010F). In nonconsolidated areas, bronchial wall thickening, tree\u2010in\u2010bud (Figure 18 F), or bronchovascular thickening were marked, and traction bronchiectasis (Figure 18 D) was seen in numerous locations. The pleural margins had a scalloped appearance with pleural fissure thickening, multifocal subpleural thickening, or peripheral consolidation. Interestingly, in the areas least affected by fibrosis, evidence of bronchiolar pathology (bronchiolectasis) was noted. Cytology of BAL fluid identified 3969 cells per microliter with 72% degenerate neutrophils and 20% lymphocytes. Given the severity of CT changes, compromised clinical state, and a lack of an identifiable treatable disease, the owner elected euthanasia. On necropsy, severe multifocal chronic\u2010active terminal and respiratory bronchiolitis with bronchiolar loss, parenchymal fibrosis, interstitial inflammation, and smooth muscle hyperplasia with marked locally extensive pleural fibrosis were observed (Figure 19 A, B). The continuum between primary bronchiolar disorders and end\u2010stage fibrosis is discussed in Box 7.\n\nAirway disorders in cats are not limited to large airway diseases such as asthma and chronic bronchitis. With more common use of CT, lesions suggestive of small airway (bronchiolar) disorders are being detected. Clinical signs and some features of thoracic radiographs can be identical for large and small airway disorders, making additional diagnostic testing necessary for definitive diagnosis. We used CT and histopathologic examinations in cats with a wide spectrum of clinicopathologic features allowing proposal of an initial classification scheme for bronchiolar disorders. Broadly, diseases of the bronchioles can be subdivided into primary bronchiolar disorders in which disease originates and is anatomically limited to small airways and secondary bronchiolar disorders at which disease in large airways or the interstitium extends to involve bronchioles. Multidisciplinary collaboration among clinicians, radiologists, and pathologists will allow further refinement of the proposed classification scheme. This review represents the first step toward recognizing and understanding a new clinically important category of respiratory disease in the cat. Future studies targeting early recognition and evaluation of therapeutic strategies for bronchiolar disorders in cats are warranted.\n\nAuthors declare no conflict of interest.\n\nAuthors declare no off\u2010label use of antimicrobials.\n\nAuthors declare no IACUC or other approval was needed.\n\nAuthors declare human ethics approval was not needed for this study."}
