{"title": "Identifcation of differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs in CD4 D T cells response to latent tuberculosis infection", "body": "Tuberculosis (TB), causing more than 1.3 million deaths in 2013, is still one of the biggest killers among the infectious diseases. 1 It is estimated that nearly oneethird of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and about 90% of them have asymptomatic, latent TB infection (LTBI). Overall, without treatment, about 10% of individuals with LTBI will develop active TB disease at some time in their lives. 2, 3 However, the underlying mechanisms of LTBI and its reactivation remain largely unknown. Host immune response against Mtb is complex and multifaceted. Identification of immune mediators which contribute to LTBI and reactivation is useful for early diagnosis, prevention and treatment of TB disease.\n\nCD4 \u00fe T cells play an important role in host defense against intracellular pathogens, including Mtb. 4e6 Genome-wide transcriptional analysis is a widely used method for the study of complex diseases. Noncoding RNAs play an important role in modulating gene transcription. 7 Based on their length, noncoding RNAs are divided into 2 major classes: short (<200 nucleotides) and long (>200 nucleotides). 8 MicroRNAs are a large group of short noncoding RNA and their roles have been relatively well studied in human biology and disease. 9 In contrast to micro-RNAs, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are much less known concerning their functions. Recent evidence indicates that lncRNAs play important roles in many physiological and pathological processes, such as cell differentiation, apoptosis, proliferation and cancer. 10e12 However, little is known about the role of lncRNAs in TB disease.\n\nCD4 \u00fe T cell-mediated immunity plays a pivotal role in modulation of immune homeostasis and control of Mtb growth. In the study, to investigate whether lncRNAs were involved in TB infection, expression profiles of both lncRNAs and mRNAs in CD4 \u00fe T cells from subjects with LTBI or active TB were detected and the relationship between deregulated lncRNAs and their adjacent protein-coding genes as well as deregulated mRNAs related to signaling pathways were analyzed.\n\nPatients with active pulmonary TB were enrolled from Weifang Chest Hospital in Shandong Province, China. Both LTBI subjects and healthy control individuals were recruited from the staff in Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University and Weifang Chest Hospital. The clinical characteristics of 30 patients with active TB (ATB group), 25 subjects with LTBI (LTBI group) and 30 healthy controls (HCo group) were presented in Table 1 . Diagnosis of active pulmonary TB was based on typical clinical symptoms, such as cough, fever, fibrocavitary lung infiltrate on chest radiography, and at least one sputum culture positive or both sputum smear and culture positive. Diagnosis of LTBI was based on the results of tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) (T-SPOT.TB, Oxford Immunotec, Oxfordshire, U.K.). All LTBI subjects had no history of recent contact with active TB patients. Before starting the study, pre-analytical evaluations were performed for detection of tumors and infectious diseases such as hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. Participants were excluded if they had a history of TB, diabetes, tumor or other infectious disease.\n\nThe study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Weifang Medical University and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided informed consent before commencement of the study.\n\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated from whole blood by use of Ficoll (TBD, Tianjin, China) CD4 \u00fe T cells were then enriched by depletion of unwanted cells. To achieve high purity of isolation, CD4 \u00fe T cells were negatively selected again from the above enriched cells.\n\nFlow cytometric analysis showed that the purity of isolated CD4 \u00fe T cells was more than 90% (Fig. S1 ). All samples were stored in liquid nitrogen until further use. Four samples of each group were used for microarray expression analysis and all samples were used for real time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).\n\nTotal RNA was extracted from purified CD4 \u00fe T cells using NM_001861, NM_000291, NM_005022, NM_001614 and NM_000841) and negative control probes were used as hybridization quality control. Quantile normalization and subsequent data processing were performed using a GeneSpring GX v12.0 software package (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were identified. It is considered statistically significant only if a P value adjusted with false discovery rate (FDR) is less than 0.05. Results were presented as fold change. Hierarchical clustering was performed using Agilent GeneSpring GX software (version 12.0).\n\nTo validate the microarray results, 4 dysregulated lncRNAs were randomly selected and used for confirmation by RT-qPCR. Briefly, 5 mg of total RNA from each sample was used for the synthesis of first strand cDNA using a PrimeScript\u00e4 RT Reagent Kit (Takara, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Following first strand cDNA synthesis, PCR reaction was carried out in a 10 mL reaction volume containing 1 \u00c2 SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, 0.4 mM of each specific forward and reverse primer, 0.5 mL of cDNA template. PCR assay was set at an initial denaturation step at 95 C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 C for 15 s and 60 C for 1 min with an ABI PRISM 7900 system (Applied Biosystems, USA). The primers used in the study (their sequences were available if necessary) were designed by optimization of parameters including melting temperature, GC content, complementarity, and secondary structure as well as primer length. No template control (containing all the reagents except template) was run to reduce the possible cross contamination from reagents as well as surfaces and no amplification control (including all the reagents other than reverse transcriptase) was used to eliminate genomic DNA contamination. All reactions were performed in triplicate. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an endogenous control. Relative expression levels of lncRNAs were calculated using 2 \u00c0DDCt method and a P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nGene ontology (GO) (www.geneontology.org) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/) were used to investigate biological functions and signaling pathways affected by differentially expressed mRNAs. 13, 14 It was considered statistically significant only if a P-value was less than 0.05.\n\nLncRNA originates from complex transcriptional loci and regulates gene expression through epigenetic regulation of chromatin modification, transcriptional and posttranscriptional processing. 15 To reveal the potential roles of lncRNA in TB infection and shed light on the underlying mechanisms of LTBI and its reactivation, the study mainly focused on analysis of the deregulated lncRNAs and relationship between them and adjacent protein-coding genes.\n\nData were presented as mean AE standard deviation (SD). ANOVA test or student's t test was used for statistical analysis. P <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nMicroarray analysis showed lncRNA and mRNA expression variations between chips ( Fig. 1 ). In order to identify the most significant candidates, lncRNAs or mRNAs with at least two-fold expression changes were selected. After data normalization, we determined hundreds of differentially expressed lncRNAs between groups in Ensembl, RNAdb, NRED, lincRNA, misc_RNA, UCSC_knowngene, H-invDB, HOX cluster, RefSeq_NR and UCR (FDR <0.05).\n\nCompared with HCo group, 449 lncRNAs (305 of them upregulated) and 1, 113 lncRNAs (550 of them up-regulated) were deregulated in LTBI group and ATB group, respectively, and 163 lncRNAs (94 of them up-regulated) were differentially expressed in both LTBI group and ATB group (FDR <0.05). Moreover, compared with ATB group, 685 lncRNAs (521 of them up-regulated) were differentially One ANOVA test was used for statistical analysis. LncRNA or mRNA with expression fold change >2 and with FDR adjusted P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. expressed in LTBI group (FDR <0.05) (Fig. 2) . It was worth noting that, 41 lncRNAs were deregulated between three groups, 23 of which showed similar expression tendency in both LTBI group and ATB group compared with HCo group (FDR <0.05) (Fig. 3 , Table 2 ). Compared with HCo group, 461 mRNAs (267 of them upregulated) were differentially expressed in LTBI group, 1,490 mRNAs (694 of them up-regulated) were differentially (Fig. 2) . It was worth noting that 60 mRNAs were deregulated between three groups, 50 of which showed similar expression tendency in both LTBI group and ATB group compared with HCo group (FDR <0.05) (Fig. 3 , Table 3 ).\n\nFour lncRNAs were randomly selected for confirmation of microarray results using RT-qPCR. Data showed that, compared with HCo group, 4 lncRNAs showed similar expression tendency in both LTBI group and ATB group: ENST00000429730 and uc011ncc.1 were down-regulated, while ENST00000457582 and chr2:192293450-192304436\u00fe were up-regulated in both LTBI group and ATB group; compared with ATB group, ENST00000429730 and uc011ncc.1 were increased, while ENST00000457582 and chr2:192293450-192304436\u00fe were decreased in LTBI group (Fig. 4) . The results were consistent with those obtained by microarray analysis.\n\nMore and more evidence suggests that lncRNAs play important roles in regulation of gene expression. 16, 17 To reveal potential roles of lncRNAs in TB infection, we analyzed the relationship between differentially expressed lncRNAs and their adjacent protein-coding genes. The majority of differentially expressed lncRNAs are from intergenic regions (w50%), natural antisense to protein-coding loci (w20%), or intronic antisense to protein-coding loci (w10%), with the others representing overlapping transcripts from exons or introns in both sense and antisense directions, exon sense-overlapping, or bidirectional regions. Among the 685 differentially expressed lncRNAs between LTBI group and ATB group, 463 of them are oriented in or around a known protein-coding region (i.e., not intergenic). Among the 41 differentially expressed lncRNAs between three groups, 16 of them are oriented in or around a known protein-coding region (Table 4 ). However, expression levels of adjacent protein-coding genes of the 16 deregulated lncRNAs were largely unaltered. Only a few lncRNAs and their associated protein-coding genes were differentially expressed simultaneously between two groups: both uc002hlx.2 and its adjacent protein coding gene CCL4L1 mRNA were down-regulated in ATB group compared with LTBI group as well as HCo group. Levels of NR_024586 lncRNA and ENST00000431999 lncRNA as well as their associated protein coding genes MLL5 mRNA and CYP1B1 mRNA were down-regulated in ATB group compared with HCo group, respectively.\n\nGO analysis showed that the differentially expressed mRNAs between LTBI group and ATB group were significantly enriched in cell communication, immune response, MAPKKK cascade, toll signaling pathway, etc. Pathway analysis indicated that the deregulated mRNAs between LTBI group and ATB group were mainly involved in MAPK signaling pathway, cytokineecytokine receptor interaction, chemokine signaling pathway, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, antigen processing and presentation, p53 signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450 (P-value <0.05 after multiple testing correction) ( Table 5 ).\n\nExpression profiles of genes involved in the pathogenesis of LTBI and active TB have been widely studied, however, the molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying TB disease \n\nAfter normalization to GAPDH expression, data were presented as mean AE SD and obtained average expression value for each lncRNA was used for statistics. One ANOVA test for three groups or student's t test for two groups was used for statistical analysis. Four lncRNAs were differentially expressed between three groups. \uff0a Significant difference between healthy controls (n Z 30) and LTBI group (n Z 25), as well as between healthy controls and active TB group (n Z 30). # Significant difference between LTBI group and active TB group. P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Error bars in graphs referred to standard deviation. Each reaction was run three separate times, with technical triplicates in each reaction. 18 Increasing studies have reported that many lncRNAs are deregulated in human diseases. 19, 20 The mechanisms of action of lncRNAs, however, are still unclear. Therefore, we performed the study to better reveal the potential role of lncRNAs in contributing to TB infection. It was interesting to note that more lncRNAs and mRNAs were deregulated in ATB group than LTBI group. The data indicated that more genes in CD4 \u00fe T cells were involved in active TB than LTBI. Compared with ATB group, 685 lncRNAs (521 of them up-regulated) and 639 mRNAs (497 of them upregulated) were differentially expressed in LTBI group, respectively. The result suggested that transcriptional activity was more decreased in active TB than that in LTBI.\n\nMoreover, 41 lncRNAs were differentially expressed between three groups and 23 of them showed similar expression tendency in both LTBI group and ATB group compared with HCo group. The results suggested that both active TB and LTBI might possess, at least partly, similar regulatory mechanisms. Increasing evidence indicates that many lncRNAs are associated with some infectious diseases.\n\nMore than 4,800 lncRNAs were involved in the host response to EV71 infection. 21 Approximately 500 lncRNAs were differentially expressed during coronavirus infection. 22 A genetic variant in HULC lncRNA contributed to risk of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma in a Chinese population. 23 LncRNAs can be used as biomarkers for many infectious diseases. 24 The data suggested that lncRNAs might be widely involved in various infectious diseases. Recent data showed that NEAT1 (uc010rog.1) played an important role in the innate immune response to influenza virus and herpes simplex virus by facilitating the expression of antiviral genes including cytokines such as interleukin-8 (IL-8). 25 Another data reported that NEAT1 was involved in the replication of HIV-1 and knockdown of NEAT1 enhanced virus production. 26 Our results showed that NEAT1 lncRNA was down-regulated in both ATB group and LTBI group compared with HCo group. The data suggested that NEAT1 may be involved in host response to pathogen infection such as TB disease. Despite much progress, function of NEAT1 is still not well-defined. Only a few lncRNAs were found to be associated with various diseases. However, their potential functions of most deregulated lncRNAs, such as ENST00000393334, AK125689, ENST00000457582 and NR_002191, are still largely unknown. Relationship: the relationship of lncRNA and its nearby coding gene. \"sense_overlapping\": the lncRNA's exon is overlapping a coding transcript exon on the same genomic strand; \"intronic\": the lncRNA is overlapping the intron of a coding transcript on the same genomic strand; \"natural antisense\": the lncRNA is transcribed from the antisense strand and overlapping with a coding transcript; \"bidirectional\": the lncRNA is oriented head to head to a coding transcript within 1000 bp; \"intergenic\": there are no overlapping or bidirectional coding transcripts nearby the lncRNA.\n\nSource: The source of lncRNA is collected from. RefSeq_NR: RefSeq validated noncoding RNA. A recent report showed that a 251-gene signature from PBMC could accurately distinguish patients with active TB from both individuals with LTBI and healthy controls. 27 One hundred and forty-four blood transcripts were able to distinguish TB from controls and other lung diseases, such as pneumonia and lung cancer. 28 A distinct whole blood 86-gene transcriptional signature of active TB is distinct from other diseases. 29 Specific molecular signatures in PBMC could distinguish active TB from LTBI after antigenic stimulation with purified protein derivative of tuberculin (PPD) in vitro. 30 The data suggested that PBMCs play important roles in the immune response to TB infection. CD4 \u00fe T cells are important components of PBMCs and here we investigated transcriptional signature of CD4 \u00fe T cells in TB infection. In the study, 60 mRNAs were differentially expressed between three groups and 50 of them showed similar expression tendency in both LTBI group and ATB group compared with HCo group, which suggested that both active TB and LTBI might have, at least partly, similar regulatory mechanisms. In the study, it was worth mentioning that most of the differentially expressed mRNAs in PBMCs 27e30 were not deregulated in CD4 \u00fe T cells, which was consistent with our recent miRNA expression results. 31 These data indicated that the major cell type in PBMCs that showed deregulated mRNAs may not be CD4 \u00fe T cells and response to TB infection of PBMCs may not be consistent with that of CD4 \u00fe T cells. Further studies are needed to explore the inconsistency between our results and published data.\n\nMost of the differentially expressed lncRNAs between LTBI group and ATB group were oriented in or around a known protein-coding region (i.e., not intergenic), and approximately 40% of which were cis-antisense lncRNAs in the study. It was reported that knockdown or down-regulation of certain lncRNA could lead to decreased expression of its neighboring protein-coding gene, which suggested that lncRNAs and nearby coding genes could have shared upstream regulation or local transcriptional effects. 32, 33 We found that only a few lncRNAs and their associated coding genes were differentially expressed simultaneously, such as both NR_024586 lncRNA and MLL5 mRNA, both ENST00000431999 lncRNA and CYP1B1mRNA, which were all down-regulated in ATB group compared with HCo group. This result suggested that these lncRNAs and mRNAs were all associated with TB, but might be independently regulated. Future studies using knockdown or over-expression techniques in a relevant model system would be a reasonable approach to uncover their potential regulatory roles in TB disease. However, most of the deregulated lncRNAs associated protein genes were not differentially expressed, which suggested that more complex mechanisms than simple cisregulation existed for these lncRNAs.\n\nMAPK signaling pathway was involved in extensive tissue inflammation in TB disease. 34 Up-regulation of GM-CSF by Mtb was mediated by MAPK-associated signaling pathway. 35 Increased cytokine response was involved in TB disease. 36 Mtb RpfB drived Th1-type T cell immunity via a TLR4dependent activation of dendritic cells. 37 These results indicated that MAPK signaling pathway and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway played important roles in TB infection. Our data showed that the differentially expressed mRNAs were also mainly involved in MAPK signaling pathway, Tolllike receptor signaling pathway, etc. This result was in part agreement with that of a recent study in CD4 \u00fe T cells. 38 Analysis of PBMC revealed that active TB was closely associated with IFN signaling pathway, and IFN-inducible transcripts were over-expressed in purified blood neutrophils, to a lesser extent monocytes, but not CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe T cells. 28, 29 The data also suggested that response to TB infection of PBMCs may not be consistent with that of CD4 \u00fe T cells. Therefore, it is necessary to study the functions of CD4 \u00fe T cells in the pathogenesis of TB disease.\n\nIn summary, we identified differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs in CD4 \u00fe T cells from subjects with LTBI and active TB, which opened up a new and interesting avenue toward an improved understanding of the relationship between lncRNA homeostasis in CD4 \u00fe T cells and TB infection. Role of lncRNAs in TB infection was just beginning to be explored and it was difficult to synthesize our results to reach a definitive conclusion based on this single study. As only 4 samples from each group were extensively evaluated, future studies are necessary to replicate, expand these findings in more patient samples. Moreover, further investigation of lncRNA roles may help to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of LTBI and its reactivation.\n\nThis work was funded by grants from the Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (No. ZR2010HM073) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81100006, No. 30972639).
