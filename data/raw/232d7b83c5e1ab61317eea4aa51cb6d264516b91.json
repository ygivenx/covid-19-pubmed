{"title": "Supplementary Information Multifunctional biophotonic nanostructures inspired by longtail glasswing butterfly for medical devices", "body": "Numerous living organisms possess fascinating structural coloration. However, transparency in insects is rare to observe among terrestrial life due to significant surface reflections between living tissues and air 1,2 . In this context, the longtail glasswing C. faunus butterfly is an interesting example given it possesses the structural basis to support both reflection-based coloration and transmissionbased transparency. The transparency of the postdiscal area can be well-explained by effective medium theory and a transfer matrix model similar to other anti-reflective subwavelength nanostructures found in nature considering low absorption of chitin 2, 3 . The subwavelength nanodomeshaped structures of the postdiscal area induces a refractive index with a linear gradient from 1 for air to 1.56 for the chitin membrane, and effectively reduces surface reflection 2,3 . Nanodome-shaped structures of the postdiscal area are hexagonally arranged and hence, a hexagonal unit cell was considered with an area of Ahex = \u221a3/2d 2 where d is the center-to-center distance between adjacent nanodomes. The radius of the nanodome at height z was provided by r(z) = r0 \u221a(1 -z/\u210e), where h is the height of the nanodomes, and r0 is the base radius that is equal to d/2. Consequently, the postdiscal nanodome area at height z is given by ATP(z) = \u03c0r0 2 (1z/h), and the volume fraction of chitin as a function of actual height is given by:\n\nfor < 0 2\u221a3 (1 \u2212 \u210e ) for 0 \u2264 \u2264 \u210e 0 for z > \u210e\n\n(1)\n\nThe base of the nanodomes was defined to include the origin of the z-axis at its centre. The remaining fraction of air is given by fair = 1 -fTP. After determining the volume fraction, the effective refractive index was calculated for any z using the well-known Maxwell-Garnett model. Then, the optical admittance and the corresponding reflection (R) and transmission (T) spectra of the stacked thin layers were calculated using a characteristic matrix method 3 .\n\nThe nanostructures of the basal area, however, utilize a different physics to remain optically transparent in the visible spectrum. The transparency occurs due to non-resonant forward Mie scattering from low index chitin (n = 1.56) 4 nanostructures that can be calculated by rigorously solving the Maxwell's equations 5,6 (See Fig. 2f ). Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations were performed using a commercial FDTD software (Lumerical Solutions Inc.) to numerically calculate the reflection (R) and transmission (T) of the basal area.\n\nIn order to compare the simulated transmission spectra of postdiscal and basal areas with experimental spectra, the membrane absorption and light reflections from its backside were considered assuming the wing membrane was surrounded by nanostructures on both sides.\n\nConsidering the thickness of the wing membrane l (500 nm) and absorption coefficient \u03b1 (\u03b1 = 4\u03c0\u03ba/\u03bb where \u03ba = 0.008 \u00b1 0.001, the extinction coefficient considered here for the chitin), the final transmittance (TF) can be calculated by 2 :\n\nThe simulated transmission spectra of both postdiscal and basal areas were plotted in Supplementary   Fig. S2 along with the experimental outcomes, showing good agreement.\n\nThe angle-independent scattering properties of the basal area as found in Fig. 2j are directly correlated to the isotropic spatial frequency of the short-range-ordered nanostructures. For example, if we consider light with an incident wave vector ki being scattered to a wave vector ks, the difference between ki and ks can be provided by the spatial frequency kb of the structure, i.e. ks\u2212ki = kb 7 . Due to the isotropic nature of the spatial frequency kb (see the FFT diagram in Fig. 2D in the main manuscript), the ks\u2212ki will remain the same irrespective of the incident angle, thereby improving the angle-independent scattering properties.\n\nTo elucidate the biological significance of the dual nano-structural basis for transparency of the C.\n\nfaunus wing, we illuminated the wings under ultraviolet (UV) light and captured images using a camera ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). No UV signature in the postdiscal areas was observed, whereas the basal areas showed violet-coloured reflectance under UV illumination ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). The short-range-ordered nanostructures with subwavelength periods in the postdiscal areas exhibited minimal scattering and high transparency in the UV-VIS light. However, similar nanostructures in the basal areas with larger inter-structural spacing comparable to the light wavelength generated backscattering in the UV range. The short-range order of the nanostructures in the spatial arrangement introduces a phase correlation in the backscattered light, leading to a coherent reflection peak in the UV regime as shown in Supplementary Fig. S4A . The characteristic length scale of the nanostructures generates such strong backward scattering of light within a narrow frequency range 8 . In general, for any wave vector of k > kb/2, short-range structural order introduces a phase correlation of light scattered by adjacent particles 9 . kb ranges between 0.021 nm -1 and 0.032 nm -1 in our 2D FFT calculation of the basal area and hence kb/2 corresponds to the frequencies in the blue spectrum.\n\nTherefore, coherent backscattered peak should appear in the frequencies higher than the blue spectrum, i. e. in the UV regime, which agrees with our experimental outcome.\n\nButterflies are known to use the UV regime as a key spectral range for mating signals [11] [12] [13] , and the nanostructures with larger spacing in the basal area may play an important role in this regard. The UV signature with a peak at a wavelength of 345 nm is confirmed by the optical spectra shown in Supplementary Fig. S4A of the basal area. The total reflection of postdiscal area is remarkably low over the whole UV-VIS regime. In order to confirm that the UV reflection of the basal area is structure-based, we removed the structural effect by soaking the wing in bromoform (n = 1.57) to match the refractive index of the inter-structural space to that of the nanostructures. After soaking, we repeated the reflection measurement and observed no reflection from the basal region confirming the structural origin of the reflection property ( Supplementary Fig. S4B ).\n\nTherefore, the short-range-ordered nanostructures on the C. faunus wings produce dual optical functionalitytransparency in the visible range and reflectance in the UV regime -that assists in camouflaging 1,14 and mating [11] [12] [13] while keeping the wings sterile by resisting microbial growth (Figs.\n\nS5 and S6).\n\nSupplementary Section SI2 | Aspect-ratio optimization of the nanostructured on the Si3N4 surface As mentioned in the manuscript, an antifouling approach relying on physical lysis may damage tissues and cells that come in contact with the implant, which may not be suitable for some medical uses. The aspect-ratio of the nanostructures was kept below 1 to rely on the hydrophilicity of the nanostructured Si3N4 surfaces to promote antifouling through anti-adhesion instead of through physical lysis. A literature survey on this phenomenon is summarized in Table S1 , revealing the aspect-ratio of 1 or greater will cause physically induced lysis on both naturally occurring and synthetic nanostructured surfaces.\n\nWith this background in mind, the nanostructure topography was optimized to an average aspect-ratio of 0.45 and a flat disk-shaped top. This aspect-ratio was chosen because there was no significant statistical difference in the anti-adhesion properties between nanostructured Si3N4 surfaces with an aspect-ratio of 0.45 and those with an aspect-ratio ranging from 0.45 to 0.9 ( Supplementary Fig. S7 , S11 and S16).\n\nFurthermore, optical simulations indicate that increasing the aspect-ratio broadens the resonance peak of the nanostructured Si3N4 ( Supplementary Fig. S10 ). The flat Si3N4-membrane produces a ballistic (specular) transmission peak due to the phase delay introduced by the thin membrane that causes light interference. The integration of nanostructures on the Si3N4-membrane broadens the total transmission-peak profile due to the combination of ballistic (due to the thin membrane) and scattered transmission (due to the nanostructures) 15 .\n\nWe describe in this section our findings on the improved biocompatibility of the nanostructures: the nanostructures resist protein adhesion as well as prokaryotic and mammalian eukaryotic biofouling due to the surface hydrophilicity and nanostructured topology. To reach our conclusion, we have performed extensive literature study on the mechanisms behind the adhesion of plasma proteins, prokaryotes, and eukaryotes on the surface of implanted biomaterials; and also carried out a comprehensive set of experimental measurements and theoretical analysis performed on the nanostructured surfaces.\n\nThe adsorption behaviour of a protein onto a surface is a complex process, which is influenced by the nature of the protein as well as the properties of the surface, and it may involve several steps such as protein association-disassociation, change in conformation, denaturation, and charge interaction between neighbouring proteins [16] [17] [18] . As a result, there is a huge variation among underlying antibiofouling mechanisms and resulting outcomes of surfaces that have been proposed to control biofouling [19] [20] [21] . In the case of the nanostructured Si3N4 surface presented in this manuscript, our results indicate that the high degree of wettability (or hydrophilicity) acts in concert with the nanostructured surface topology to produce improved biocompatibility. We discuss this behaviour of the substrate by considering energy barriers in the following paragraphs.\n\nLet us consider attachment of a protein to a surface first. The reaction can be represented as:\n\nWhere, protein molecules in an aqueous media or liquid (PL) are interacting with a surface submerged in liquid (SL) and leading to adsorption of protein molecules on the surface represented as PS. The effective free energy change for this reaction can be represented as \u0394GPS, which is dependent on the interfacial free energies of protein-liquid (\u03b3PL), protein-surface (\u03b3PS), and surface-liquid (\u03b3SL) 22 . This can be shown as 23 :\n\nFor improved biocompatibility and reduced adsorption, the net energy change for the process should be positive, i.e. \u0394GPS > 0, and a higher value of \u0394GPS would imply an unstable protein-surface interaction or a higher resistance to biofouling due to easy detachment. The interfacial free energies are dependent on the interactions between (1) the substrate surface and the liquid media (governed by the wettability of the surface); (2) the protein molecules and the liquid media (governed by the structure and distribution of hydrophobic/hydrophilic residues on the proteins); and (3) the protein molecules and the surface (dependent on both of the above factors). Normally proteins hide their hydrophobic residues away from water while their charged, polar amino-acid side-chains are exposed to water 24, 25 . As a result, charges on the proteins will also influence protein-protein interactions, which can lead to an aggregation of proteins in solution.\n\nNoticeably hydrophilic surfaces such as nanostructures improve the affiliation between the surface and water molecules by lowering \u03b3SL, which is favourable for improved biocompatibility. If the protein has a higher degree of hydrophobic residues or behaviour, \u03b3PS will be higher, which is favourable, but \u03b3PL will also be higher, which is unfavourable. Decrease in hydrophobicity of the protein will result in both lowering the \u03b3PS (unfavourable) and \u03b3PL(favourable). Changes in protein conformation during the surface adsorption process can also occur 16, 17 , changing the interfacial free energy (\u03b3PS).\n\nThe surface-energy analysis indicates that in the case of the nanostructured Si3N4 surface, the increased hydrophilicity of the substrate also increases the energy barrier for protein adsorption on the surface. That is to say, there is a larger energy barrier to the replacement of water molecules in contact with the nanostructured Si3N4 surface (measured contact angle: 17\u00ba) with proteins as compared to a mildly hydrophilic surface such as flat Si3N4 (measured contact angle: 38\u00ba). However, it is important to keep in mind that the degree of resistance to protein adsorption also depends on factors such as the structure, sequence, and nature of resultant charges on the protein molecules.\n\nPreviously, hydrophilic surfaces, which effectively bind water molecules and prevent protein adsorption, have been utilized for improved biocompatibility previously such as immobilized PEGbased films 26, 27 and self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) 28, 29 . However, the protein resistance of these surfaces decay over time due to factors such as auto-oxidation resulting in the formation of more nonpolar and less hydrophilic functional groups such as aldehydes and ethers 30 . Additionally, these surfaces are susceptible to physical defects and therefore are not suitable for long-term usage 31, 32 . The noticeable hydrophilicity of the nanostructured Si3N4 surface results from the physical topology of the surface and is expected to show much better long-term reliability than chemical coatings.\n\nTo isolate the contribution from the improved hydrophilicity to the deterrence of protein adhesion, we However, after 24 hours, the nanostructured Si3N4 surface displays the lowest contact angle and the greatest resistance to protein adsorption while the nonpermanent plasma-treated surface loses its hydrophilicity and its contact angle returns back to a value close to that of a non-treated flat Si3N4 surface ( Supplementary Fig. S17A ).\n\nWhen considering the case of cellular adhesion to surfaces, we can consider the following reaction:\n\nWhere, cells in an aqueous media or liquid (CL) are interacting with a surface submerged in liquid (SL) and leading to adsorption of cellular molecules on the surface represented as CS. The free energy change can be expressed as:\n\nThe effect of surface wettability on the free energies in this case is also very similar with proteins.\n\nImproved hydrophilicity of the surface implies that \u03b3SL will be lower, which increases the barrier for displacement of water molecules on the surface by cells and is favourable for improving biocompatibility. The degree of improvement will once again be dependent on the other two terms (\u03b3CS and \u03b3CL), which are dependent on the nature of charges on the cells and their apparent hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity (discussed in further detail by Liu et al.) 23 . Indeed, it has been shown that increase in surface hydrophobicity (contact angle change from 15\u00ba to 100\u00ba) correlated directly with increase in surface adsorption of bacteria, algal spores, and eukaryotic cells [33] [34] [35] [36] The second possible case occurs when the cell membrane does not elongate to fill the gaps in the nanopatterned substrate. It has been shown that this situation leads to a reduction in adhesion points between the substrate and cells 39 , leading to poor adhesion of cells on patterned surfaces as compared to a flat surface and consequently easier detachment. Therefore, nanotopology-driven outcomes such as membrane deformation or reduction in adhesion points contribute towards destabilizing the interaction between the cell membrane and substrate, improving resistance to cellular adsorption. Our results demonstrate that nanostructured Si3N4 surface shows a drastic decrease in both prokaryotic and mammalian cellular adhesion as compared to a flat substrate (with or without plasma treatment) due to the increased contribution from the nanotopology (Supplementary Fig. S17C-D) . This is evident from the fact that greater cell adhesion resistance is offered by the nanostructured Si3N4 surface over the plasma-treated Si3N4 surface of a similar contact angle.\n\nTo summarize, based on evidences found in literatures and results obtained from our experiments, we have analysed the underlying mechanism that produced the much improved biocompatibility of the nanostructured substrate: it is the combination of (a) much-improved, nanopattern-based, hydrophilicity that increases the energy barrier for protein and cellular adhesion on the substrate; and (b) nanostructured surface topology, which reduces the energy barrier for detachment of cells from the surface and destabilizes cellular adhesion to the substrate.\n\nSupplementary Table S1 Si3N4, and nanostructured Si3N4 surfaces after 72 hours (P > 0.05, ns: not significant, two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's multiple comparisons test, s.d., n = 8 representative images).

The aspect-ratio of 0.45 chosen to implement the nanostructured Si3N4-membrane for the IOP-sensing implant is highlighted in red. The experiment was conducted once. Error bars are given by the standard deviation about the mean. The decrease in cavity gap size results in a blue-shift of the FP-cavity resonance spectrum which would be detected through reflection spectroscopy. c, A measured raw spectrum (top) and how its peaks map into the pre-characterization lines (bottom) generated in benchtop studies performed on the sensor before implantation. Each pre-characterization line represents the position of the associated peak as a function of pressure. The lines were generated by placing the sensor inside a pressure-controlled chamber connected with a reference digital pressure gauge and a pressure controller, and during a pressure ramp at a step size of 0.2 mmHg, the peak locations of each raw spectrum at a given pressure (provided by the digital pressure gauge) is recorded along with the pressure level. The relation between the given pressure and the associated set of the peak locations is one-to-one mapping. During in vivo studies, an IOP-identification algorithm maps the location of the major peaks in the raw spectrum reflected from the sensor to the best matching IOP-level using the pre-characterization lines. d, Custom-built hand-held detector interfaced with a CCD camera and a mini-spectrometer for live in vivo IOP detection in awake New Zealand white rabbits.\n\nSupplementary Figure S20 | Angle-dependent properties of the FP cavity and improvement using nanostructured Si3N4. a, A flat-surfaced FP cavity under normal incidence provides a correct, high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) reflection spectrum. b, In comparison, a nanostructured FP cavity produces a reflection spectrum of marginally reduced SNR due to optimally controlled"}
