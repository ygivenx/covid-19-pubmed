{"title": "Anti-MHV3 state induced by IFN gamma in macrophages is not related to arginine metabolism", "body": "The Mouse Hepatitis Virus 3 (MHV3) is used as a model of viral infection in which resistance is dependent on the genetic background of the mouse strain [8, 17, 29, 36] . The differential magnitude of the antiviral state induced by interferon gamma (IFN gamma) in macrophages from resistant (A/J) and susceptible (BALB/c) mouse strains were shown to be speci\u00aec for MHV3, correlating with the host resistance to the experimental viral infection [25] . Our previous studies have shown that resistance to MHV3 infection in mouse populations can be a consequence of a T-cell dependent mechanism, in which the production of IFN gamma and the sensitivity of macrophages to IFN gamma play an essential role [19, 20, 25, 36, 37] .\n\nIn the attempt to elucidate the cellular basis of the macrophage expression of antiviral state in response to IFN gamma, we have shown that the release of TNF alpha, IL-1, O \u00c0 2 and H 2 O 2 by A/J and BALB/c macrophages upon IFN gamma activation and/or MHV3 infection seems not to account for the antiviral state exerted by A/J macrophages and may contribute to the susceptibility of BALB/c mice by playing a pathological role [21, 35] .\n\nIn macrophages, NO synthase (iNOS) and arginase are inducible enzymes that act on a common substract, arginine. As a consequence, arginine is oxidized by iNOS producing nitric oxide (NO) and citrulline or is hydrolyzed by arginase producing ornithine and urea [12] . We have recently shown that a competition of both enzymes for their substrate takes place in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages and that the iNOS and arginase appear to de\u00aene two alternate functional states of macrophages, induced by, respectively, TH1 (IFN gamma) and TH2 cytokines (IL4 and IL10) [26] .\n\nNO has been considered an important effector molecule with protective or harmful effects on the organism and directly involved in antiviral activities [6, 10, 15, 33] . The inhibition of ectromelia, vaccinia and herpes simplex 1 viruses in IFN gamma activated mouse macrophages correlated with the cell production of NO [11, 13] . It has been shown the iNOS induced in macrophages of mice infected with Coxsackie B3 virus and a higher mortality of these infected mice when fed iNOS inhibitors [18] . A direct antiviral effect of NO with inhibition of vaccinia virus replication at the level of DNA synthesis has also been shown [24] . Recent \u00aendings indicate that NO prevents Epstein-Barr virus replication by inhibiting viral DNA ampli\u00aecation and by blocking activation of the latent viral genome [14] . Published data suggest that signaling requirement of NF-kB activation and NO production in Newcastle disease virus-treated macrophages are similar [34] . On the other hand, there are indications that NO may not be essential for the virus clearance, since treatment of vaccinia virus-infected mice with the iNOS inhibitor did not alter the course of infection [30] . In a recent publication, Kreil and Eibl [16] showed that NO has no antiviral activity against tick-borne encephalitis virus infection in murine macrophages and can even contribute to pathogenesis in experimental infection.\n\nIn contrast, the arginase induction in macrophages as well as its consequences has been poorly studied [4, 5, 26] . Early reports implicate the arginase in antiviral activities in macrophages, tumor cell cytotoxicity and immunosuppression during mixed leukocyte culture [31, 32, 39] .\n\nIn view of the differential role of macrophages from resistant or susceptible mice, in restricting the replication of MHV3 upon activation by IFN gamma, we have drawn attention to the arginine metabolism as a possible biochemical basis for explaining the IFN gamma induced anti-MHV3 effect in macrophages from resistant and susceptible mice.\n\nA/J and BALB/c mice were obtained from the mouse colony of the Max-Planck Institut for Immunobiology, Freiburg, Germany. C57BL/6\u00c2129Sv knockout mice de\u00aecient in inducible iNOS (iNOS\u00c0a\u00c0 and its wild type counterparts (iNOSa were kindly supplied by J. D. MacMicking and C. Nathan [22] . They were kept under conventional conditions and used at 4 to 8-week-old. Care of animals followed the appropriated guidelines.\n\nBone marrow-derived macrophages of mice were obtained from bone marrow cells collected from the femurs by\u00afushing the cavities with Dulbecco's modi\u00aeed MEM (DMEM)(Biochrom, Berlin) supplemented with 100 units (U)/ml of penicillin (Sigma) and 100 mg/ml stretomycin (Sigma). Cells were cultured in non-toxic Te\u00afon bags (\u00afuorinated ethylene propylene, Biofolie 25; Heraeus) as described [1, 27] . The Te\u00afon foils were folded, sealed with a diathermal sealing apparatus (Polystar 100 B and Polystar 401 M-RPA; Riesche-Herfurth) to give rectangular bags and subjected to gas sterilization. Cells 5 \u00c2 10 4 /ml) in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS)(Biochrom, Berlin), 5% horse serum (Gibco), 15% L929 supernatant as a source of colony-stimulating factor, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 1% sodium pyruvate (Gibco) and 0.5% 2-mercaptothanol (Sigma) were incubated for 12 days at 37 C in the presence of 10% CO 2 . Cells were detached by repeated careful stretching of the Te\u00afon bags, washed once with medium and used in the experiments. MHV3 was cloned by limiting dilution, one plaque was selected and ampli\u00aeed on L929 cells to serve as the inoculum for future stocks [23] to limit spontaneous mutations. The stocks were always titrated by plaque assay on L929 cells as previously described [28] . Aliquots containing 2 \u00c210 5 plaque forming units per milliliter (PFU/ml) were stored at \u00c080 C and used in all experiments.\n\nBone marrow-derived macrophages from mice, cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS at a concentration of 10 5 cells/well in 96-well plates, were treated for the indicated time with 100 U/ml of recombinant IFN gamma (Dr. Adolf, Ernst-Boehringer-Institut, Vienna) or 10 U/ml of recombinant IL10 (Pepro-Tech, London, UK) or 10 U/ml of recombinant IL4 (R-D Systems, Abingdon, UK) or 0.5 mM of N-methyl-arginine (NMA) (Alexis Gruenberg, Germany) or 0.5 mM of hydroxyarginine (OH-ARG) (Alexis Gruenberg, Germany). The macrophages were alternatively cultivated in arginine free medium (-ARG) (Biochrom, Berlin). In all the experiments the macrophages were infected with 0.1 moi of MHV3 and the virus growth measured in the culture supernatants 24 h after infection [28] .\n\nArginase activity was measured in macrophage lysates as previously described [3] . Brie\u00afy, 10 6 cells were lysed with 0.5 ml 0.1% Triton X100 and after 30 min 0.5 ml of a buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl and 5 mM Mn Cl 2 , pH 7.4 was added. The enzyme was then activated by heating for 10 min at 56 C. Arginine hydrolysis was carried out by incubating 25 ml of the activated lysate with 25 ml of 0.5 M arginine, pH 9.7 at 37 C for 60 min. The reaction was stopped with 400 ml of an acidic mixture (H 2 SO 4 , H 3 PO 4 and H 2 0, 1:3:7 v/v). The urea was measured at 540 nm after addition of 25 ml of 9% alpha-isonitrosopropiophenone (dissolved in 100% ethanol) and then heating at 100 C for 45 min. One unit of enzyme activity is de\u00aened as the amount of enzyme which catalyses the formation of 1 mmol urea/min. NO was measured as nitrite using the Griess reagent. Culture supernatant (100 ml) was mixed with 100 ml of 1% sulfanilamide, 0.1% naphtylenediamine dihydrochloride and 2.5% H 3 PO 4 . Absorbance was measured at 540 nm in a ELISA reader (Biochrom, Berlin). Results of all experiments are the mean values with standard deviations of triplicate cultures.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 1 , no spontaneous synthesis or NO occurred in both mouse macrophage populations. Following the IFN gamma activation, NO release occurred and higher amounts were observed in BALB/c mouse macrophage cultures. When the cultures were performed in the presence of arginine free \n\nThe data presented in Fig. 2 , con\u00aerming our previous data [26] , indicate that the background levels of arginase were higher in BALB/c mouse macrophages than in A/J ones. Also in agreement with our previous data [26] , in both macrophage populations, the IFN gamma treatment had a small suppressive effect on the background levels of arginase expression. The MHV3 infection did not in\u00afuenced signi\u00aecantly the arginase expression, the lower levels observed in MHV3-infected BALB/c mouse macrophages being due to the cell destruction taking place during the virus infection. On the other hand, the IL4 or IL10 were capable of inducing arginase expression in both macrophage populations which was higher in A/J mouse macrophages.\n\nIn contrast to BALB/c mouse macrophages, the A/J ones, after IFN gamma activation, are able to partially inhibit the virus growth. This effect, which can \n\nIn Table 1 we show that in both iNOS\u00c0a\u00c0 and iNOSa mouse macrophages, the MHV3 could replicate to the same level and were similarly inhibited following IFN gamma/IL4 activation. As expected, in contrast to the macrophages from the wild type (iNOSa, the iNOS\u00c0a\u00c0 were not capable of releasing NO following activation. Both macrophage populations showed comparable expression of arginase following activation.\n\nThe mouse hepatitis virus strains of coronavirus are responsible for endemically occurring enteritis in most mouse colonies [7] . It has been speculated that the macrophages play a central role in determining the resistance to experimental infection of mice with MHV3 [2, 38] . The immune response, the virus replication, the antiviral state induced by interferon and the expression of a monokine with procoagulant activity in macrophages have been implicated in the resistance/susceptibility of mouse strains to MHV3 infection [8, 9, 17, 19, 20, 29, 36, 37] . We have shown that the MHV3-susceptible BALB/c mice have macrophages where the virus can grow to high titers and are not restricted when they are activated with IFN gamma. In contrast, the MHV3-resistant A/J mice have macrophages that respond to IFN gamma activation, partially restricting the virus growth [19, 20, 25, 36, 37] . The cellular/molecular basis of this is not yet known, and this study was undertaken in an attempt to investigate the involvement of arginine metabolism on the IFN gamma induced anti-MHV3 effect in macrophages from resistant and susceptible mice.\n\nNO, a product of arginine metabolism, is a highly reactive molecule produced from a guanidine nitrogen of arginine in a reaction catalyzed by NO synthase. It has been suggested that NO, which is synthesized in high levels by macrophages, plays a role in host defense. The NO is produced in response to stimulation by IFN gamma and may exert an antimicrobial activity against a variety of pathogens, providing a rapid and non-speci\u00aec defense. [6, 10, 11, 13, 14, 18, 24, 33] . The arginase, an inducible enzyme in macrophages upon stimulation, has been implicated in virus inhibition and may potentially play an antimicrobial activity [4, 26, 31, 32, 39] .\n\nWe show here that, in our culture conditions, both A/J and BALB/c mouse macrophages were not capable spontaneously to produce NO. Following stimulation with IFN gamma or IL4/IL10, the BALB/c mouse macrophages were always capable of synthesizing higher amounts of, respectively, NO or arginase, when compared to what we obtained with A/J mouse macrophages. As expected, when the cultures were performed in the presence of arginine free medium or NMA or both, a drastic decrease in the synthesis of NO was observed (Fig. 1) . The MHV3 infection was capable to further enhance the NO release in both cell populations but did not in\u00afuence the arginase expression, the lower levels observed in MHV3-infected BALB/c mouse macrophages being due to the cell destruction taking place during the virus infection ( Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 ). Con\u00aerming previous reported data [26] , the IFN gamma treatment had a small suppressive effect on the arginase expression in both macrophage populations. The partial inhibition of virus replication, which is induced by IFN gamma in A/J mouse macrophages, could not be reversed by macrophages treatment with NO or arginase inhibitors. Also, the MHV3 replication in IFN gamma activated or not activated BALB/c macrophages was not in\u00afuenced by treatment with NO or arginase inhibitors.\n\nTaken together the results show that both macrophage populations were capable of synthesizing NO and/or arginase but that the magnitude of MHV3 replication in these cells was not in\u00afuenced by their induction or inhibition during the infection. In further support to this observation, we found that the level of MHV3 replication or inhibition was not in\u00afuenced when we used macrophages from knockout mice for the iNOS gene, and as a consequence were unable of synthesizing NO (Table 1 ).\n\nIn conclusion, these data from the study of MHV3 replication and arginine metabolism modulated by cytokines like IFN gamma, IL4 and IL10 or inhibitors of the distinct pathways of such a metabolism, like NMA or OH-Arg, performed in macrophage cultures from MHV3-resistant and susceptible mice, led us to suggest that the antiviral state induced by IFN gamma occurring only in cells from resistant animals is not related to arginine metabolism. Such an evidence was reinforced by the results obtained with mice lacking inducible NO."}
