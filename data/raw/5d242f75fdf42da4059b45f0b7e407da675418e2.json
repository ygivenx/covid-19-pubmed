Influenza A virus has caused significant morbidity in the last and in this century 1 . To date, influenza-specific drugs include M2 ion channel blockers (amantadine and rimantadine) and neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir), both of which were approved to prevent and treat influenza 2 . However, rapid emergence of drug-resistant mutants restricts their utilization 3, 4 , and therefore leads to an urgent need to develop novel antivirals.\n\nThe use of high-throughput screening (HTS) technology for antiviral discovery is a fairly recent endeavor. Utilizing virusinducible reporter genes to quantitate the infectivity has been achieved for several viruses 5,6 . A reporter system mimicking the process of transcription/replication of influenza virus was constructed by Lutz et al. 7 . Cells were transfected with a reporter system that expressed Firefly luciferase in a response proportional to the infectivity of influenza virus. This luciferase assay is more rapid and simple than the standard plaque assays. Afterward de Vries et al. 8 adapted this system by substituting Gaussia luciferase. Gaussia luciferase (hereafter referred to as Gluc), discovered from the marine copepod Gaussia princeps, can give high levels of light emission centered at 470 nm by catalyzing the oxidation of the substrate coelenterazine to coelenteramide 9 . This reaction requires no cofactors but O 2, and it generates over 100-fold higher bioluminescent signal intensity when compared with other frequently used luciferase reactions (e.g., Renilla or Firefly luciferase) 10, 11 . With the help of a secretory signal, Gluc was secreted into the culture medium. Lysis of the cells was not necessary, and the measurement of luciferase activity was simple and time-saving, making Gluc assays a promising technique. Nevertheless, transient transfection of the Gluc reporter system is likely to introduce variation between the experiments.\n\nIn this work, a stable cell line derived from 293T cell was established, named 293T-Gluc. It synthesizes the reporter protein Gluc when infected with influenza A virus. We then developed a reporter assay based on this engineered cell line. Antiviral activities of three anti-influenza compounds (ribavirin, amantadine hydrochloride and nucleozin) were assessed by this assay. Results demonstrated the ability of this assay to identify influenza inhibitors. Several parameters (Z 0 factor, CV, S/B, S/N) utilized to evaluate the quality of HTS (high-throughput screening) assays also validated our approach. These findings suggest that this cell-based assay is a promising tool to identify new anti-influenza drugs.\n\nMDCK and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen). The cells were cultured at 37 1C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 . Influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) was rescued from eight plasmids using cocultured MDCK and 293T cells 12 . Influenza A/ PR/8/1934 (H1N1), seasonal influenza B/Beijinghaidian/1386/ 2013 (Victoria) and influenza B/Massachusetts/02/2012 (Yamagata) were propagated in embryonated chicken eggs according to classical virological techniques. Virus titers were determined on MDCK cells and represented as the median tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ), as previously described 13 . These viruses were provided kindly by Dr. Yuelong Shu at China CDC.\n\nCoelenterazine-h was purchased from Promega. Nucleozin and TPCK-treated trypsin were obtained from Sigma. The Microsource Library (2000 compounds) was obtained from commercial sources and compounds from this library were dissolved in DMSO at 2 mmol/L. Plasmid pHH-Gluc (a kind gift from Dr. Erik de Vries 8 ) was used as template for Gluc reporter system (containing the RNA polymerase I promoter/terminator and influenza A/WSN/33 NP segment UTRs) amplification. The primers used are as follows: forward primer 5 0 -TATGAATTCGGAAAAACGCCAGC AAC-3 0 and reverse primer 5 0 -ATAAGGGCCCAAAATCTTCTTT-CATCCGC-3 0 . PCR products were cloned into pLenti6/V5-DEST vector (Invitrogen) generating pLenti6-Gluc.\n\n293T cells were transfected with pLenti6-Gluc using lipofecta-mine2000 in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol, and then were selected with 10 \u03bcg/mL Blasticidin 24 h posttransfection. Under antibiotic selective pressure several clonal colonies were obtained and tested for luciferase expression. One clonal cell line demonstrated high-level expression of luciferase; this cell line was named 293T-Gluc and was used for subsequent experiments.\n\n293T-Gluc cells were cultured to 90% confluence, released with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and resuspended in DMEM with 10% FBS at 7 \u00c2 10 5 cells/mL. Cells were then seeded in the wells of 96-well plate at 100 \u03bcL/well. After an overnight incubation at 37 1C and 5% CO 2 , cells were infected with the indicated influenza viruses, which were contained in 10 \u03bcL serum-free DMEM culture medium. Post-infection medium also contained TPCK-treated trypsin with the final concentration of 1 \u03bcg/mL.\n\nIn specificity studies, infection was allowed to proceed for 24 h at 35 1C. For influenza A/PR/8/1934, influenza B/Beijinghaidian/ 1386/2013 (Victoria) and influenza B/Massachusetts/02/2012 (Yamagata), infections were carried out at a multiplicity of 0.1, 1 and 10, respectively, whereas a multiplicity of 0.1 and 1 was used when testing the response of influenza A/WSN/33 virus to Gluc reporter assay.\n\nThe dynamic signal range of the Gluc reporter assay was assessed by infecting 293T-Gluc cells with varying quantities of influenza A/WSN/33 virus (MOI of 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 and 1) and determining Gluc activity at various times post-infection (12, 24, 36 and 48 h post-infection).\n\nFor evaluation assay of antivirals and high-throughput screening, 1 \u03bcL of each tested compound was added to cells and incubated for 2 h prior to infection, after which cells were infected with influenza A/WSN/33 virus at an MOI of 0.05. After a further incubation for 24 h at 37 1C, the cell supernatant was collected and measured for Gluc activity. In each 96-well plate ribavirin and DMSO were used as positive and negative controls, respectively.\n\nThe inhibition rate of the tested compounds was calculated with the following equation, where RLU indicates relative light unit:\n\nInhibition rate\u00bc(RLU infected cells \u00c0RLU tested compound )/(RLU infected cells \u00c0RLU mock-infected cells ) \u00c2 100%.\n\nA stock of coelenterazine-h was prepared in ethanol to a concentration of 1.022 mmol/L and stored at -20 1C. Before assay the stock was diluted into PBS by a factor of 60, which was used as working solution for luminescence. The working solution was held for 30 min at room temperature in the dark to stabilize it 14 . For luminescence analysis, 60 \u03bcL of working solution was added to 10 \u03bcL of cell-free conditioned medium and measured for 0.5 s using a 96-well microplate luminometer with automated substrate injection (Berthold Centro LB 960). The results were expressed in relative light units (RLUs).\n\nIn construction of pLenti6-Gluc, the open reading frame (ORF) of the influenza A/WSN/33 NP protein was replaced by Gaussia luciferase and this RNA segment was inserted in a human RNA polymerase I promoter/terminator cassette in the reverse orientation and complementary sense. As a stable cell line, 293T-Gluc cells that contain pLenti6-Gluc synthesize a viral negative strand RNA constitutively, which expresses Gluc under control of the untranslated regions (UTRs) of the influenza A/WSN/33 NP segment (Fig. 1) . We assessed the response of this reporter cell line to different strains of influenza virus. As shown in Fig. 2 , the infection with influenza A viruses induced much higher luciferase activity than did the two strains of influenza B virus. The observation that the 293T-Gluc cell line is more responsive to influenza A virus may reflect species specificity of UTR region for the corresponding RdRp, which is consistent with a previous observation 7 . Among all the virus strains tested, the A/WSN/33 strain exhibited the most potent ability to induce luciferase activity when the cells were infected at identical MOI. Therefore, influenza A/WSN/33 virus was used for all subsequent experiments.\n\nTo further optimize the assay a signal range was determined using serial 10-fold dilutions of influenza A/WSN/33 virus. As shown in Fig. 3 , infection at MOIs of 0.1 or higher induced a Gluc signal at 12 h post-infection, and signal intensity significantly increased thereafter and reached a peak at 36 h post-infection. When infected with virus at MOIs of 0.001 or lower, cells failed to generate a detectable Gluc signal. It should be noted that viral infection at an MOI of 1 induced significant CPE in 293T-Gluc cells like MDCK, while the cells kept a normal morphology during the 96 h time period of post-infection when the MOI was less than 0.1 (data not shown). This may explain the observation that the Gluc signal from the cells infected at an MOI of 1 was less than that of MOI of 0.1 (Fig. 3) , most likely due to reduced cell viability. \n\nTo ascertain assay sensitivity, three reference compounds, including ribavirin, amantadine hydrochloride and nucleozin, were examined in our assay. Ribavirin is used against several DNA and RNA viruses including influenza viruses 15, 16 . It is converted to ribavirin monophosphate, which disturbs GTP synthesis, leading to inhibition of RNA synthesis in cells 17 . Amantadine hydrochloride, approved for the treatment of influenza infections, acts in the early phase of the life cycle of influenza A virus to target the M2 ion channel 18, 19 . Nucleozin is a novel inhibitor with antiinfluenza activity. It impedes influenza A virus replication by triggering the aggregation of NP and inhibits its nuclear accumulation 20 . We used the Gluc reporter assay to evaluate these antivirals in dose-response experiments, measuring IC 50 (Fig. 4) . All the compounds showed the ability to reduce the luciferase signal driven by influenza A/WSN/33 virus. IC 50 values determined from our experiments were comparable to data previously reported (Table 1) , demonstrating the applicability of the Gluc reporter assay for screening influenza inhibitors. Furthermore, compared with the conventional plaque reduction assay (PRA) 24 , the method herein is more rapid and simple for the determination of IC 50 values. At least 48 h were needed before the number of plaques could be calculated, whereas our assay can give results in 24 h after infection. Moreover, this unbiased and automated method of infectivity quantitation avoids tedious plaque counting, making it an ideal approach.\n\nThe above results suggest the potential to use the Gluc reporter assay to screen compounds against influenza A virus. To ensure that the assay can be used in high-throughput screening, we assessed its accuracy by using several statistical parameters 25 ( Table 2) . Z 0 factor is a simple statistical characteristic for HTS assay. It can be used to evaluate the performance of an assay. A robust assay should have a Z 0 factor40.5 and the larger the value of Z 0 factor, the better the data quality of the assay 26 . The Z 0 factor in our experiments was 0.84 (n \u00bc48), which is considered to be excellent for use in HTS (Fig. 5) . Normally, infected cells treated with a positive anti-influenza compound are used as positive control for calculating the Z 0 factor. Nevertheless, according to the assay validation guidance for agonist assays (http://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/books/NBK83783/), the background signal is also suitable for use as a 'minimum signal'. Since viral infection acts as an agonist of luminescent protein, we used mock-infected cells as positive control in the validation analysis. Similarly, other work used mock-infected cells as positive control to calculate the Z 0 factor 27 . In addition, as shown in Fig. 4 , most of the anti-influenza compounds tested were able to achieve full inhibition in our assay. Moreover, the minimum signals derived from infected cells treated with one of the positive anti-influenza compounds were close to that of mock-infected cells. CV is another parameter used for quality assessment. It reflects signal deviation within an assay and is recommended to be less than or equal to 20% (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK83783/). The CV of our assay was 5.79%, which meets the requirements for HTS. In addition, the S/B ratio (23.24) and the S/N ratio (16.29) were comparable to those of other HTS assays reported 28, 29 , proving our assay was suitable for use in a high-throughput screen.\n\nAs a proof of concept, we carried out a pilot screening of the Microsource Library as described above and the results are plotted in Fig. 6 . In each 96-well plate, ribavirin and DMSO were used as a positive and negative control, respectively. Majority of the 2000 screened compounds did not decrease the luminescence signal by more than 50%. Seventeen showed strong luminescence reduction by 90%-100%, which translates to a hit rate of 0.85%. Compared with assays exploiting the principle of cytopathic effects (CPE) protection 30 , the approach established here is rapid and simple for anti-influenza inhibitor screening. We anticipate that this approach will facilitate the discovery of compounds with anti-influenza activity and lead to drug development.\n\nInfluenza virus remains a health threat, and much more work needs to be done to discover new antivirals. In this work we reported a cell-based high-throughput assay to identify inhibitors for influenza virus. The assay used Gaussia luciferase as a readout. Several criterions for HTS were evaluated, including Z 0 factor and CV. Results obtained validated the robustness of our assay. Furthermore, we used this high-throughput assay to screen 2000 small molecules at 20 \u03bcmol/L. Seventeen compounds showed 90%-100% inhibition of luminescence signal for a rate of 0.85%. Utilization of this cellbased high-throughput assay will benefit identification of new antiinfluenza lead compounds in future work. "}
