{"title": "Sub- or supercritical transmissibilities in a finite disease outbreak: Symmetry in outbreak properties of a disease conditioned on extinction", "body": "Over the past two decades, outbreaks of SARS (Riley et al., 2003), pandemic flu (Cauchemez et al., 2013), MERS-CoV (Cauchemez et al., 2016), Ebola (WHO Ebola Response Team, 2014) and more recently Zika (Ferguson et al., 2016), have illustrated the importance of early characterisation of the transmissibility of emerging or re-emerging pathogens. Typically, characterisation is achieved by estimating either the basic reproduction number R0, which applies in a large population that is fully susceptible, or the instantaneous reproduction number Rt, which applies at time t after start of an outbreak, and which accounts for past exposure and any interventions which have mitigated the spread of the pathogen. Such estimates of transmissibility have been used to assess the level of intervention required to control an outbreak. For instance, if R0 > 1 and vaccination is possible, then treating a proportion of the population that exceeds 1\u20131/R0 will bring an outbreak under control (Fine et al., 2011). Furthermore, the reproduction number (either Rt or R0) has multiple uses including: (i) forecasting future incidence of a pathogen (Nouvellet et al., 2018), (ii) monitoring the impact of newly implemented control strategies (International Ebola Response Team, 2016), and (iii) predicting current and future attack rates (Ferguson et al., 2016).\n\nFuture preparedness, however, ultimately relies on the early assessment of future threats, ideally before a full blown outbreak or epidemic occurs (Karesh et al., 2012). This requires characterising the transmissibility of pathogens that are responsible for short lived outbreaks which have become extinct without any preventative interventions (Farrington et al., 2003, Farrington and Grant, 1999). Intuitively, the limited nature of such an outbreak could reflect a low transmissibility of the pathogen or it could reflect stochastic behaviour of the early transmission process.\n\nHere, we provide properties and a characterisation of outbreaks that have become extinct in the absence of any intervention. A key parameter of such outbreaks is the reproduction number R, namely the mean number of new infections produced by a single infectious individual (Cori et al., 2013, Wallinga and Teunis, 2004). We shall assume that R remains constant throughout an outbreak that goes extinct.\n\nDue to individual or environmental variation, there is variation in the number of new infections produced by different infected individuals. The number of new infections (secondary cases) thus follows a probability distribution which is usually referred to as the offspring distribution (Farrington et al., 2003, Farrington and Grant, 1999). By definition, the mean of this distribution is the reproduction number R.\n\nTypically, the offspring distribution is modelled by either a Poisson distribution, a geometric distribution, or negative binomial distribution (Garske and Rhodes, 2008, Lloyd-Smith, 2007, Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005). In this work we shall adopt a negative binomial form for the offspring distribution. This is a somewhat flexible choice since this distribution depends on two parameters and has two standard distributions as limiting cases (see below).\n\nWe write the negative binomial distribution as NB(\u03b4, p) where \u03b4 and p are parameters of the distribution, and lie in the ranges \u03b4 > 0 and 0 < p < 1. In terms of these parameters, the form of the negative binomial distribution we adopt is such that the mean and variance are given by p\u03b4/(1\u2212p) and p\u03b4/(1\u2212p)2,respectively.\n\nIn what follows, we shall take p=R/(R+\u03b4), in which case the mean and the variance of the offspring distribution are R and R+R2/\u03b4, respectively. The mean, R, is thus the reproduction number and the quantity \u03b4 is conventionally referred to, in the literature, as the dispersion. Generally, large values of \u03b4 correspond to low levels of heterogeneity (i.e., a low variance) in realised values of the infectiousness, while small values of \u03b4 correspond to high levels of heterogeneity. For more details about heterogeneity, see the work of Garske and Rhodes (2008), Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005). In the particular case of no over-dispersion (\u03b4=\u221e), the negative binomial distribution reduces to a Poisson distribution, while when there is unit dispersion (\u03b4=1) the negative binomial distribution reduces to a geometric distribution.\n\nAn outbreak that has become extinct can always be described by a \u2018small\u2019 reproduction number Rs that lies below unity (thus Rs is subcritical). However, as we show in the Supplementary Information, all dynamical properties of such an outbreak are completely indistinguishable from an outbreak characterised by a \u2018large\u2019 reproduction number Rl that lies above unity (thus Rl is supercritical), but where the incidence of the disease is conditioned so that it eventually achieves extinction. The two reproduction numbers satisfy the inequality Rl > 1 > Rs > 0.\n\nGenerally, all dynamical results calculated for Rl, when conditioned on eventually achieving extinction, are identical to the results calculated for Rs. Another way of saying this is that given the eventual occurrence of extinction, and given that there were Xt cases in generation t, the probability of observing Xt+s cases in generation t + s is the same for outbreaks with either Rs or Rl. This is ultimately a property of Eq. (1) and follows from mathematical results which apply for branching processes (Athreya and Ney, 1972, Waugh, 1958). We shall refer to the identity of results for Rs and Rl as the symmetry of the problem.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this symmetry was first implied by Kendall (1956) in the context of stochastic dynamics of epidemics. The symmetry was then further explored in the context Markov processes (Athreya and Ney, 1972, Daly, 1979, Waugh, 1958) and more recently in the context of infectious disease outbreaks (Guttorp and Perlman, 2015).\n\nIn the Supplementary Information we use elementary approaches to provide intuition about the origin of this symmetry and establish some relevant results. Our demonstration of the symmetry, unlike previous ones does not rely on probability generating functions, but rather is derived directly from the properties of the transition matrix.\n\nIn what follows, when we discuss the large reproduction number Rl, we shall often leave implicit the fact that the population has been conditioned upon the occurrence of eventual extinction.\n\nTo establish some useful results and relations, we have found it useful to introduce the quantity \u025b, which is the probability of eventual extinction of a disease outbreak when: (i) the outbreak starts with a single infected individual, and (ii) the reproduction number is larger than unity. We note that condition (i) readily generalises: when there are n infected individuals, the probability of eventual extinction is \u025bn, (see the Supplementary Information). Furthermore, because of condition (ii) eventual extinction is not inevitable and so \u025b < 1.\n\nIt is convenient to proceed using \u025b and \u03b4 as the independent parameters in the problem, and then determining other quantities in terms of these. We find that for \u025b < 1, independent of the actual initial size, n, of the outbreak, the two reproduction numbers are given by(3a)Rs=g(\u03b4,\u03b5)and(3b)Rl=g(\u03b4,1\u03b5)where the function g(d, x) is given by(3c)g(d,x)=dx1/d\u221211\u2212x\u22121(see the Supplementary Information).\n\nWe note that Eq. (3b) relates the large reproduction number, Rl, to the dispersion, \u03b4, and to the probability of extinction given a single infected individual, \u025b. Thus given a reproduction number that is greater than unity, and given the value of the dispersion, we can use Eq. (3b) to compute the probability of extinction. This result allows us to illustrate that increasing the dispersion (i.e., decreasing \u03b4) reduces the probability of extinction (Blumberg and Lloyd-Smith, 2013a, Blumberg and Lloyd-Smith, 2013b, Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005), see Fig. 2A.\n\nWe additionally note that using (3a), (3b), (3c)) allows us to determine a very simple relation between Rs and Rl, namely(4)Rs=\u03b5(1+1\u03b4)Rl.\n\nThis can be interpreted as saying that the small reproduction number Rs is a discounted version of the large reproduction number Rl, with the discount a power of the extinction probability, \u025b, associated with Rl.\n\nAdditionally, writing \u03b5=e\u2212\u03b1, (3b) and (3c) yield the exact result\u03b1={Rl+W(\u2212Rle\u2212Rl)foraPoissondistributionofoffspring(W(x)isLambert\"sWfunction)ln(Rl)forageometricdistributionofoffspring\u2212ln[(1\u2212p1\u2212pe\u2212\u03b1)\u03b4]foranegativebinomialdistributionofoffspring(p=RlRl+\u03b4)(see the Supplementary Information).\n\nEq. (4) provides a simple way to map reproduction numbers that are above unity (supercritical R values) to dynamically equivalent reproduction numbers of a finite outbreak that all lie below unity (subcritical R values). The result of Eq. (4) also allows us to show how, for a given value of Rl, the corresponding value of Rs is higher as over-dispersion increases (i.e., \u03b4 decreases), see Fig. 2B.\n\nFinite outbreaks are often quantified in terms of the outbreak size (Farrington et al., 2003) (also called final size), which is a random variable we denote by Z and which is defined by Z=\u2211t=0\u221eXt. This random variable counts the total number of individuals who suffered infection during the entire course of the outbreak. In the Supplementary Information, we provide an analytical treatment of the outbreak size distribution, when the offspring distribution is a negative binomial. This treatment can be used to estimate the reproduction number given observation(s) of outbreak size(s). We also present a numerical method to evaluate the distribution of outbreak sizes associated with outbreaks that eventually become extinct.\n\nWe verify to high accuracy, with simulations, that the reproduction numbers Rs and Rl of Eqs. (3a) and (3b) lead to the same distribution of outbreak sizes (see Fig. 1A).\n\nThe outbreak duration (Farrington and Grant, 1999) is a random time we denote by Text, that corresponds to the number of generations where the incidence of the disease is different from zero. This also has identical dynamics for the reproduction numbers Rs and Rl of Eqs. (3a) and (3b), see Fig. 1B. An analytical treatment of the outbreak duration distribution can be found in the Supplementary Information.\n\nFor a finite outbreak, rather than characterising the complete distribution of the final-size and the complete distribution of the duration (as in Fig. 1), we note that knowledge of the mean and standard deviation of those distributions can be sufficient to characterise broad dynamical patterns (Fine et al., 2011). In the Supplementary Information, we provide a simple formulation that allows precise numerical computation of the mean and variance of both the final size distribution and the duration distribution, see Fig. 2C and D. Again, we show that the means and standard deviations for both of these distributions are identical when the reproduction number is Rs and when it is Rl and eventual extinction is conditioned upon.\n\nFrom a practical point of view, on observing an extinct outbreak of final size z (with z=1,2,3\u2026), the key issue is to estimate the reproduction number characterising the disease. Estimating such reproduction number involves computing the probability of observing a final outbreak size, given a value of the reproduction number, i.e. the likelihood of the parameter. Conditional on eventual extinction, given the symmetry in outbreak size distributions for either Rl or Rs, the individual likelihoods of observing the final size, given a reproduction number of either Rl or Rs are also identical (Fig. 3A).\n\nHowever,1 the full likelihood, i.e. unconditional on extinction, must be weighted by the probability of extinction having occurred. Given this weight is unity for Rs and \u025bn for Rl, the symmetry in the likelihood is lost after accounting for extinction, as illustrated in Fig. 3B (see the Supplementary information).\n\nConveniently, when estimating the reproduction number, the mapping of Rs onto Rl, means that the likelihood can be evaluated only on the Rs domain (i.e., 0\u20131) and the likelihood of Rl follows by simply weighting the results on Rs by the probability of extinction.\n\nWe note that the increased level of randomness/uncertainty associated with a small outbreak leads, perhaps counterintuitively, to a greater chance of inferring a larger reproduction number than when a large outbreak is observed. For example, Fig. 3C shows that there is a larger probability of Rl being greater than 2, when the final outbreak size is small, than when the final outbreak size is large (e.g., Pr(Rl>2|Z=1)>Pr(Rl>2|Z=10)).\n\nUltimately, given observation of a single outbreak of final size z, one would want to know the risk of a future outbreak of the pathogen running out of control, and leading to an epidemic. The probability of such an epidemic, which we write as Pr(Epidemic|Z = z), can be formalised in a branching process as the probability that extinction will not occur in a future outbreak, given that a total of z cases were previously observed in an ultimately extinct outbreak. With FutureExt the event of extinction given reintroduction of the pathogen, we can write Pr(Epidemic|Z = z) = 1\u2212Pr(FutureExt|Z=z) and this is illustrated in Fig. (3D). Interestingly, this result allows us to show that Pr(Epidemic|Z = z) decreases as the size of the initial extinct outbreak increases. This illustrates the effect, on prediction, of an increased uncertainty associated with a small outbreak.\n\nThe analysis presented in this work provides a demonstration that the dynamics of a supercritical process conditioned on extinction is in every way identical to the dynamics of a subcritical process. Unlike previous demonstrations (Guttorp and Perlman, 2015, Kendall, 1956, Waugh, 1958), we have relied on the properties of the transition matrix to derive the result. A benefit in this approach is to allow us to derive (i) explicit analytic results for mapping a supercritical reproduction number to its subcritical counterpart, and (ii) explicit analytic results for the expected distributions, means and variances of the final size and duration of the extinct outbreak. The results obtained are applicable when the offspring distribution is characterised by a Poisson, geometric or negative binomial distributions.\n\nWhile the collapsing of supercritical dynamics conditioned on extinction onto subcritical dynamics has been known (Guttorp and Perlman, 2015, Kendall, 1956, Waugh, 1958), it is clearly under-exploited, or has not been appreciated in the literature of infectious disease dynamics. As highlighted by Nishiura et al. (2012), studies of minor outbreaks typically adopt \u2018the key assumption that a subcritical process (i.e. R0 < 1) resulted in the observation\u2019 (Blumberg and Lloyd-Smith, 2013a,b; Cauchemez et al., 2013, Ferguson et al., 2004, Kucharski and Edmunds, 2015). However, we show the likelihood of a supercritical process can also be explored, therefore we see no reason to restrict any such analyses to subcritical process assumptions. We provide a simple way to explore the full range of reproduction number values (i.e. beyond the subcritical range) using likelihood framework. Such framework is easily applicable and has already been in part implemented in an R package (see http://github.com/reconhub/branchr) and used in a recent publication (Cori et al., 2018).\n\nLike many other applications (Blumberg and Lloyd-Smith, 2013a,b; Cauchemez et al., 2013, Ferguson et al., 2004, Kucharski and Edmunds, 2015), our work assumes that the reproduction number remains constant during the duration of the outbreak. While public health and clinical interventions (Cori et al., 2013), as well as behaviour (Funk et al., 2009), can affect the reproduction number during an outbreak, we believe that it is reasonable to assume a constant reproduction number when the outbreaks are of limited durations and sizes. As well as there often being limited available time to intervene, for many diseases (including emerging zoonotic diseases), we have limited knowledge of how to curb transmission, which is further complicated by availability and access to treatment. Additionally, when interventions have been implemented, one could view the estimated reproduction number as an effective reproduction number, see e.g., Blumberg et al. (2015). In practical terms, once again, our conclusions best applies in the context of relatively small outbreaks of short duration, where the conditioning on extinction is realistic. For large outbreaks, it is likely that other factors such local depletion of the susceptible population or the implementation of public health interventions, played a stronger role in the extinction process than stochasticity by reducing the reproduction number.\n\nOur work illustrates the importance of stochastic factors during the early phase of an outbreak (Ferguson et al., 2004, Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005). The symmetrical property of the dynamics emerging for either a small R or a large R conditioned on extinction may appear initially counter-intuitive. However, a simple intuition may come from the following: when R is small, large outbreaks are unlikely to occur, while when R is large, large outbreaks are unlikely to remain finite, therefore after conditioning on extinction, only small outbreaks will be observed. The occurrence of extinction when R is larger than unity must not be under-estimated. For instance, perhaps slightly counterintuitively, when a disease reappears, a full-blown outbreak is more likely to occur following a small extinct outbreak rather than following a moderately large one, assuming the same transmissibility applies to the new and extinct outbreaks. However, as the size of an outbreak becomes larger, there is a shift in the impact of stochastic factors toward deterministic behaviour: moderately large (ultimately extinct) outbreaks reflect an R close to unity, but given extinction occurred despite a relatively large outbreak size, stochastic factors have a decreased influence, leading to higher confidence that R lies below 1. Conversely, a small outbreak may reflect a small R, but the large uncertainty means a large R cannot be ruled out.\n\nOverall, we have considered the transmissibility of a disease, on observing a finite outbreak, and believe we have shed light on its nature and provided some useful analytical and numerical methods for its investigation.\n\nDW and PN jointly formulated the initial idea, jointly designed and performed all analyses and jointly wrote the manuscript.\n\nWe declare no conflict of interest.\n\nPN acknowledge funding from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID, AID-OAA-F-16-00115), the Medical Research Council (MR/R015600/1) and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Protection Research Unit in Modelling Methodology (HPRU-2012-10080).
