{"title": "Live Poultry Exposure and Public Response to Influenza A(H7N9) in Urban and Rural China during Two Epidemic Waves in 2013-2014", "body": "Avian influenza A(H7N9) virus has caused two major epidemics of human infections since emerging in early 2013. The first epidemic occurred in the spring of 2013 in eastern China [1, 2], while the second epidemic occurred over the winter of 2013\u201314 in eastern and southern China. As of 12 January 2015, there have been 490 laboratory-confirmed cases of human H7N9 infection and 188 deaths while the detection of a small number of mild cases in sentinel surveillance system implies that the true number of human infections is likely to be much greater than the reported laboratory-confirmed cases [3]. More than 80% of the confirmed H7N9 cases reported exposure to live poultry or a live poultry market (LPM) prior to symptom onset [1]. Because the H7N9 virus has low pathogenicity in poultry, unlike highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, it is challenging to control the transmission of H7N9 from poultry to humans. LPMs were closed in the cities with H7N9 cases reported and/or environmental specimens testing positive for H7N9 during the spring 2013 and winter 2013\u201314 epidemics. Permanent closure of LPMs has been proposed in some of the cities affected by H7N9 [4, 5].\n\nA previous study of risk factors for human infection with H5N1 suggested that patterns of poultry exposure particularly to dead/sick poultry were very different between rural and urban residents in China [6]. Our previous study suggested that population exposure to live poultry was common and risk perception to H7N9 was relatively low in China during the first wave of H7N9 epidemic in 2013 while high heterogeneity was observed in urban and rural residents across different areas [7]. Given the geographical differences observed in laboratory-confirmed cases in the two H7N9 waves, in this study we aimed to investigate patterns and changes in live poultry exposure, risk perceptions and attitudes towards H7N9, and preventive interventions adopted by the public in rural and urban areas of Guangdong province in southern China which was heavily affected during the winter 2013\u201314 epidemic.\n\nEthical approval for this study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The IRB approved that verbal consent should be obtained from all participants. Subjects from whom consent was obtained were asked to complete the questionnaire.\n\nTwo surveys in Guangzhou were conducted in May-June 2013 (Survey U1), and between December 2013 and January 2014 (Survey U2), with 500 and 549 interviews completed, respectively. Two surveys in the rural area of Zijin County recruited 308 subjects in July 2013 (Survey R1), and 300 between December 2013 and January 2014 (Survey R2). More young adults were recruited in the urban than rural area in all surveys. Urban subjects reported having relatively higher educational level on average in Survey U1 than those in Survey U2 (S1 Table).\n\nAround half of the urban respondents (53.8%) reported having visited LPMs in the previous year in the first survey, around double that reported in the second survey (27.7%). Urban respondents in the first survey reported purchasing an average of 36.5 live poultry in the past year, while respondents in the second survey reported an average of 26.7 live poultry purchased in the past year. Of those who reported buying live poultry at least once, the proportion of respondents who would always touch live poultry declined considerably from 50.2% in the first survey to 20.6% in the second survey. In the rural surveys, around half of the subjects reported raising backyard poultry in the past year in the first survey, and this increased to 83.2% in the second survey. Around 70%-80% urban subjects in both surveys reported buying less live poultry since H7N9 cases were detected in China. During the second survey, 58.5% of rural subjects reported that they changed live poultry purchase behavior since the H7N9 virus reemerged in winter 2013\u201314. One third of urban subjects supported the permanent closure of LPMs in the first and second surveys while only 11% of rural subjects supported LPM closure in the second survey.\n\nUrban subjects showed a higher general anxiety and more worry about H7N9 in the second than the first survey while rural subjects had slightly lower general anxiety score (1.74 vs 1.86) but greater worry about H7N9 (5.71 vs 4.20) in the second survey (Table 1). The proportion of urban subjects who perceived a higher absolute susceptibility to H7N9 (2.6%) and higher relative susceptibility (0.7%) in the first survey is lower than that reported in the second survey, 4.3% and 3.8% for absolute and relative susceptibility, respectively. In the rural area, few subjects perceived higher absolute and relative susceptibility to H7N9 in the first survey while a considerably increased proportion of subjects perceiving higher absolute (16.3%) and relative (10.4%) susceptibility was observed in the second survey. In general, both urban and rural subjects had a higher ILI symptom-induced worry against H7N9 in the second than the first survey.\n\nWe examined factors affecting poultry purchase behaviors and support of LPM closure (Table 2). We found that married subjects and those having received higher level of education were likely to have lower exposure to live poultry after adjusting for other confounding factors. Touching poultry during purchase in LPMs also declined in the second survey (odds ratio (OR): 0.3, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.2, 0.6), and those worrying more about H7N9 were likely to touch less. Female sex, older age, and those having higher level of worry, perceiving higher severity or knowing that H7N9 can be transmitted by contact were associated with changes in poultry purchase behaviors (Table 2), while support for the permanent closure of LPMs was only associated with female sex, higher level of worry towards H7N9 and ILI-induced worry, and marginally associated with the perceived effectiveness of H7N9 control by the government.\n\nIn rural respondents, we examined factors affecting backyard poultry, support for LPM closure and changes in purchasing behaviors (S2 Table). We found that respondents were more likely to support closure of LPMs if they were female, had greater worry about H7N9, higher perceived susceptibility, greater ILI symptom-induced worry, or lower perceived severity of H7N9 relative to H5N1. Rural respondents were more likely to report a change in their purchasing behavior if they were more educated, had greater ILI symptom-induced worry, perceived greater severity compared to seasonal influenza or H5N1, knowing that H7N9 can be transmitted by contact, or perceived less effectiveness of H7N9 control by the government.\n\nThe impact of two epidemics caused by H7N9 virus was different in mainland China during spring 2013 and winter 2013\u201314 epidemics with more laboratory-confirmed cases across a broader geographical area in the second wave. Human infection with H7N9 was associated with exposure to live poultry or LPMs from epidemiological investigations on laboratory-confirmed H7N9 cases for risk factors during the first wave in 2013 [1, 2, 10, 11]. A small number of H7N9 cases were reported in the spring 2013 epidemic in Guangdong province where our surveys were conducted while more cases were reported during the second epidemic in winter 2013\u201314 (Fig 1), indicating higher transmission of H7N9 during that period. The declining exposure to live poultry and LPMs in urban subjects in the second wave compared to the first wave was consistent with greater worry among respondents (Table 1), leading to changes in protective behaviors such as less visits to LPMs and less purchase of live poultry (Table 2) while there was a seasonal increase in poultry demand due to the Spring Festival in both urban and rural China from the late January to the early February. Nevertheless, exposure to live poultry was still common in both epidemics.\n\nNo apparent reduction was reported by the rural subjects in terms of backyard poultry exposure in this study, suggesting that rural subjects were probably aware that most detected H7N9 cases exposed to urban LPMs/live poultry instead of backyard poultry, or that factors associated with live poultry exposure in the rural area might be different from those in urban cities. The inconsistency between the higher level of worries and perceived risk of infection and the unchanged poultry exposure in rural subjects implied that decision-making on raising backyard poultry might not be driven by these factors although contact with live poultry or virus-contaminated objects was regarded as the possible routes of H7N9 transmission by most of rural subjects (Table 1). Changes in raising backyard poultry in the rural area was different from patterns observed in the urban area on live poultry exposure in both waves possibly implying that circulation of H7N9 virus in rural backyard poultry was less than that detected in urban LPMs.\n\nLPM closure has been suggested highly effective in reducing H7N9 transmission in the H7N9 epidemic [12]. Reduction of live poultry exposure reported by urban subjects in two surveys to some extent reflected the effect of market closure although poultry demands usually increase during the Chinese Lunar New Year and the change in live poultry contact could also be due to increased risk perception to the virus in the public or seasonal variation in poultry exposure. Around one third of urban respondents supported closure of LPMs in both surveys (Table 1) despite much more proximal risk in the second survey, during the winter 2013\u201314 epidemic when many cases were reported in Guangzhou. Perceived susceptibility was not a significant predictor of support for LPM closure (Table 2).\n\nThere are a number of limitations to our study. As with all observational studies, our findings may have been affected by reporting biases such as recall bias or social desirability bias, the latter occurring if respondents provided answers that they considered to be more desirable than the truth. Because we used telephone surveys in urban areas and face-to-face interviews in rural areas, and responses may differ depending on the mode of data collection, we avoided direct quantitative comparisons between the two settings. Our present study focused on an urban and rural area in southern China, and the findings may not generalize to other parts of China.\n\nIn conclusion, live poultry exposures were common in urban and rural areas of Guangdong province. Exposures declined in urban residents during winter 2013\u201314, at least partly due to the H7N9 epidemic. Changes in poultry purchasing behavior were associated with greater worry about H7N9. A minority of urban respondents supported permanent LPM closure. Further efforts are needed to protect public health if H7N9 re-emerges in a third epidemic in the winter of 2014\u201315."}
