{"title": "Cholesterol is important for the entry process of porcine deltacoronavirus", "body": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a newly discovered enteric coronavirus associated with acute enteritis and intestinal damage in piglets [6, 7] . It is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that taxonomically belongs to the genus Deltacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales. The virus was first discovered in pigs in Hong Kong in 2012 and subsequently, has been reported in the US, China, South Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam since 2014 [7, 9, 13, 14] . PDCoV infection results in severe villous atrophy in the small intestine, leading to watery diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and mortality in nursing piglets. The clinical and pathological presentations of PDCoV are indistinguishable from other swine enteric diseases caused by transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), but there is apparently lower mortality in affected neonatal piglets [6] .\n\nLipid rafts are membrane microdomains that are enriched in cholesterol, sphingolipids, and associated proteins, and are involved in the process of virus infection [1] . Cholesterol is an essential component of lipid rafts, and it plays important roles in various aspects of the virus life cycle, especially viral entry [15] . In particular, the successful entry of enveloped viruses including many coronaviruses requires the presence of cholesterol in either the viral and cellular membranes or both [3, 5, [10] [11] [12] 16] . However, the potential relationship between cholesterol and PDCoV replication remains undetermined. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the necessity of cholesterol and the mechanism by which it acts in PDCoV infection.\n\nSwine testicle (ST) cells were cultured in alpha minimum essential medium (\u03b1-MEM, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen). PDCoV strain KNU16-07 was propagated in ST cells in virus growth medium [\u03b1-MEM supplemented with antibiotic-antimycotic solutions, 10 mM HEPES (Invitrogen), and 5 \u03bcg/ml of trypsin] as described previously [4] . M\u03b2CD and water-soluble cholesterol were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and dissolved in distilled water (DW) and ethanol, respectively. The cytotoxic effects of these compounds on ST cells were analyzed using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (Sigma) as described previously [5] . PDCoV N protein-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) KDN 4-1 used in this study was described previously [4] . ST cells were pretreated with M\u03b2CD or DW for 1 h, mock infected or infected with PDCoV at a multiplicity of infection of 1, and then cultivated in virus growth medium supplemented with M\u03b2CD or vehicle at the desired concentrations unless otherwise indicated. The M\u03b2CD-treated and virus-infected ST cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) as described previously [4, 5] . The culture supernatants were also collected at 24 h post-infection (hpi). The PDCoV titer was measured by limiting dilution on ST cells in duplicate, and 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) per ml was calculated as described previously [4] . For cholesterol replenishment, ST cells were first preincubated with vehicle (DW) or M\u03b2CD at various final concentrations for 1 h, supplemented with 10 \u03bcg/ml exogenous cholesterol or 0.1% (v/v) ethanol as a vehicle control in cell culture medium for 1 h and then inoculated with PDCoV. In parallel, the cellular cholesterol content was determined using a Cholesterol Cell-Based Detection Assay Kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) according to the manufacturer's instructions [5] .\n\nTo remove cholesterol from viral membranes, viral suspensions were treated with M\u03b2CD at various concentrations at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h followed by ultracentrifugation to remove the M\u03b2CD as described previously [5] . For cholesterol replenishment, virus suspensions were mock treated or treated with M\u03b2CD at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h and then supplemented with or without 100 \u03bcg/ml exogenous cholesterol for 1 h followed by ultracentrifugation as described previously [5] . In addition, the virion cholesterol content was determined by fluorescence intensity analysis using filipin III (Cayman Chemical) with a SPARK 10M multimode microplate reader (TECAN, M\u00e4nnedorf, Switzerland) as described previously [5] . All statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test, and P-values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\nAccording to the results of an MTT assay, none of the doses of M\u03b2CD and cholesterol employed in the present study had an adverse effect on cell viability ( Supplementary  Fig. S1 ). ST cells were pretreated with M\u03b2CD at concentrations of 1 and 3 mM, or with DW as a vehicle control, for 1 h prior to infection. Viral production was initially measured by monitoring cytopathic effects (CPE) and was later confirmed by IFA using the anti-N protein MAb. M\u03b2CD (the cholesterol-sequestering compound) dramatically reduced virus-induced CPE and expression of the PDCoV gene in a dose-dependent manner ( Supplementary Fig. S2A ). Based on the quantification of the N protein staining results, the proportion (%) of virus-infected cells was noticeably attenuated by M\u03b2CD treatment. There was an approximate maximum of ~95% inhibition of both viruses in response to the application of 3 mM M\u03b2CD (Fig. 1A ). Treating cells with 3 mM M\u03b2CD at 0 and 1 hpi also resulted in an approximate ~85% decrease in PDCoV production, whereas exposure to the compound at 2-24 hpi had no significant inhibitory effect on infectivity compared with the control levels (Supplementary Fig. S3 ). These results demonstrate that M\u03b2CD must be present pre-infection or at an early stage of viral infection to exert its antiviral effect as a cellular cholesterol depletion reagent. We also determined viral yields during the pharmacological depletion of cellular cholesterol. As illustrated in Fig. 1B , M\u03b2CD inhibited the growth of viral progeny in a dose-dependent manner. The peak viral titer in the vehicletreated control was 10 8.45 TCID 50 /ml in the vehicle-treated control, whereas the addition of 3 mM M\u03b2CD reduced the titer of PDCoV to 10 6.45 TCID 50 /ml (representing a 2-log reduction compared with the control level). Taken together, our data indicate that depleting cholesterol from target cells efficiently suppresses PDCoV replication.\n\nNext, we examined whether cholesterol replenishment restored PDCoV infectivity in M\u03b2CD-treated cells. The addition of exogenous cholesterol to M\u03b2CD-treated and virus-infected cells significantly reversed the antiviral activity of M\u03b2CD. Although incubation with M\u03b2CD alone greatly reduced PDCoV production to 59% and 29% at concentrations of 1 mM and 3 mM, respectively, supplementation with exogenous cholesterol significantly increased PDCoV production to 64% and 49%, respectively, at the same concentrations of M\u03b2CD (Fig. 1C) . Consistently, cholesterol replenishment resulted in an increase in the virus yield comparable to that of the vehicle control (Fig. 1D) . To verify the importance of cellular cholesterol, we then investigated alterations in cellular cholesterol content in cells treated with M\u03b2CD in the absence or presence of exogenous cholesterol using filipin III, which is a fluorescent polyene antibiotic that binds to cholesterol. In accordance with the lower intensity of CPE, cellular cholesterol levels specifically decreased in virus-infected M\u03b2CD-treated cells compared with those in virus-infected non-treated cells. Supplementation with exogenous cholesterol markedly elevated the cholesterol level and CPE production in virus-infected M\u03b2CD-treated cells (Fig. 1E) . Altogether, the data reveal that cellular cholesterol plays a pivotal role in PDCoV infection.\n\nTo analyze whether virion-associated cholesterol is required for PDCoV infection, the virus was mock-treated or treated with M\u03b2CD at concentrations of 1 and 3 mM prior to inoculation, and the infectivity was investigated using virological methods. Similar to, but less effective (only 3 mM) than the effect of cellular cholesterol depletion, the removal of cholesterol from virions resulted in a significant reduction in the replication of PDCoV (a reduction of almost 60% at the highest concentration used) ( Fig. 2A ; Supplementary  Fig. S2B) . Furthermore, the PDCoV titer was reduced to 10 7.20 TCID 50 /ml following treatment of the virus with 3 mM M\u03b2CD (representing a more than 1-log reduction compared with the control level) (Fig. 2B) .\n\nTo verify whether the effect of virion cholesterol depletion was reversible, exogenous cholesterol was added to viral suspensions pretreated with M\u03b2CD. PDCoV infection decreased to 60% in the presence of M\u03b2CD alone at 3 mM, whereas virus production increased to 71% at the same concentration of M\u03b2CD when exogenous cholesterol was added (Fig. 2C) . Consequently, the reduced viral titer following M\u03b2CD treatment was restored to values close to those observed in vehicle-treated virus-infected cells (Fig. 2D) .\n\nTo confirm these results, we measured the content of viral cholesterol following treatment with M\u03b2CD alone, and following treatment with M\u03b2CD and cholesterol replenishment. As shown in Fig. 2E , the viral cholesterol levels were significantly reduced in the M\u03b2CD-treated viruses compared with those in the vehicle-treated viruses. However, exogenous cholesterol restored the cholesterol values of the viral membranes to close to those determined prior to M\u03b2CD treatment. Our results reveal that the cholesterol contents of both the cell membrane and the viral envelope are relevant to PDCoV infection in vitro.\n\nTo determine at what point pharmacological depletion of cellular or viral cholesterol directly influences PDCoV entry, we assessed two stages of viral entry (attachment and penetration) using binding and internalization assays after treatment of the target cells or virions with M\u03b2CD as described previously [5] . We treated cells with M\u03b2CD and maintained them at 4 \u00b0C to permit viral binding but prevent internalization. As shown in Fig. 3A , the PDCoV titer was reduced in a dose-dependent manner in the cells, indicating that cellular cholesterol depletion inhibits the attachment of the virus to the cells. Moreover, PDCoV production was diminished in M\u03b2CD-treated cells that had been incubated at 37 \u00b0C to enable virus entry to proceed, which implies that cholesterol sequestration disturbs the internalization of PDCoV. Similarly, the removal of cholesterol from the viral envelope negatively affected the viral adsorption and post-adsorption steps (Fig. 3B) . Taken together, these data demonstrate that the pharmacological sequestration of cholesterol hinders viral attachment and subsequent penetration, and the presence of cholesterol in both the cell membrane and viral envelope are indispensable for the PDCoV entry process.\n\nIn conclusion, our findings indicate that optimal infectivity of PDCoV requires cholesterol in the cell membrane and virus envelope, and that this is critical for the entry of PDCoV. Many coronaviruses exploit cholesterol, which is present in the viral envelope and/or the cell membrane for maximal virus entry. Only cellular cholesterol is essential for the entry of some coronaviruses including mouse hepatitis virus [2] , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [8] , human coronavirus 229E [10] , avian infectious bronchitis virus [3] , type II feline coronavirus (FCoV) [16] , and PEDV [5] . However, as with PDCoV in the present study, canine coronavirus, type 1 FCoV, and TGEV [11, 12, 16] . Considering previous and present studies, the cholesterol dependence of infection differs among coronaviruses. Because the PDCoV receptor has not yet been identified, we were unable to examine whether cholesterol dependence is quantitatively related to the presence of a hitherto-unidentified receptor. Future research should address the question of whether cholesterol facilitates PDCoV entry through interactions between the viral spike protein and the cellular receptor. Nevertheless, we propose that both cellular and viral cholesterol are key players in the attachment and penetration stages of PDCoV entry. However, cholesterol depletion from the cell or virus consistently resulted in the reduction, but not the elimination, of viral infectivity. This indicates that viral entry may occur when there are low levels of cholesterol, but increased cholesterol content in both parts makes the process more efficient. Although our analysis did not elucidate the mechanism by which cholesterol promotes PDCoV entry, we assume that cholesterol-dependent viral entry is closely connected to maintaining the lipid raft structure and/or biological membrane fluidity. Impeding virus entry is a viable antiviral strategy because it likely acts on extracellular targets, thereby limiting cell damage. Therefore, PDCoV could be used as a surrogate model for testing emerging coronavirus antiviral therapies. Since no treatments or vaccines are currently available for PDCoV, the results presented here indicate that molecules that disrupt viral and/or cell cholesterol, and interfere with cholesterol function during viral entry, may provide an excellent therapeutic option for the treatment of coronavirus infection in humans and animals.
