{"title": "Comparison of Patients Hospitalized With Influenza A Subtypes H7N9, H5N1, and\n2009 Pandemic H1N1", "body": "All subjects with influenza virus infection reported in this manuscript were hospitalized\npatients. The patients with laboratory-confirmed H7N9 infection were all hospitalized in\nChina between 25 February and 4 May 2013. The Chinese H5N1 cases represent all\nhospitalized cases of laboratory-confirmed H5N1 virus infection detected between 30\nNovember 2003 and 8 February 2012. The Vietnamese H5N1 cases represent all hospitalized\ncases of laboratory-confirmed H5N1 virus infection detected between 25 December 2003 and\n14 March 2009 [9]. A comparison of the Chinese\nand Vietnamese H5N1 cases showed similar demographic characteristics, underlying medical\nconditions, and behavioral risk factors (Supplementary Data). Patients with pH1N1 virus infection in China were\nascertained through hospitals designated for the treatment of severe cases. The case\ndefinitions and time periods for ascertaining patients hospitalized with influenza A H5N1,\nH7N9, and pH1N1 virus infections are available in the Supplementary Data.\n\nClinical and laboratory data were abstracted retrospectively from original medical\nrecords for cases of H7N9, H5N1, and pH1N1 virus infections. Laboratory values were\npresented as medians with interquartile ranges and were dichotomized into normal or\nabnormal based on normal ranges for children and adults (Supplementary Table 1). Because the only subjects aged <29 days were 5\nsubjects with pH1N1 virus infection, and normal laboratory values are different in\nneonates compared with other age groups, we excluded all subjects aged <29 days from\nthe assessment of laboratory results. We excluded pH1N1 cases from the analysis of signs\nand symptoms on admission as the ascertainment process for these cases required the\npresence of 1 or more symptoms, many of which were severe.\n\nThe Chinese National Health and Family Planning Commission determined that the collection\nof data from H5N1, H7N9, and pH1N1 cases was part of public health investigations of\nemerging influenza outbreaks and was exempt from institutional review board assessment.\nThe Science and Ethics Committee of the Ministry of Science and Technology of Vietnam\napproved the collection of clinical data from Vietnamese subjects with H5N1 virus\ninfection.\n\nTo assess the importance of putative risk factors for hospitalization with each influenza\nA subtype, we estimated the relative risk of being hospitalized in subjects with and\nwithout risk factors. Data on the prevalence of each risk factor in the general Chinese\npopulation were used as denominators for the risk estimates and to weight (adjust) the\noverall relative risk estimates by age and sex. Data on age- and sex-specific population\nprevalence were available for coronary heart disease, chronic renal disease, diabetes,\nhypertension, smoking, and obesity; age-specific but not sex-specific population\nprevalence was available for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n[10\u201313]. The definitions for these conditions are shown in the\nSupplementary Data. The age- and sex-stratified population prevalence of\nchronic heart disease (CHD; excluding isolated hypertension) was estimated from a study\nthat recorded a prior history of hospitalization with coronary artery disease (A history\nof hospitalization for myocardial infarction or a surgical history of coronary balloon\nangioplasty, or coronary stent implantation or coronary artery bypass.) [10]. We assumed that the age distribution of\ncoronary artery disease is a valid proxy for the age distribution of CHD. Where surveys\nassessed disease prevalence only in older adults, we assumed that prevalence was zero in\nthose younger than the lower age limit of the survey. Because we were not able to source\nrelevant baseline data for Vietnam, we have assumed that the age distribution of chronic\ndiseases is similar in the Chinese and Vietnamese populations.\n\nWe compared the characteristic of patients infected by different subtypes using Fisher\nexact test or \u03c72 test for comparing proportions and Wilcoxon signed-rank\ntest for comparing medians of continuous variables. To evaluate the association between\nrisk factors and the risk of hospitalization, Poisson regression was used to estimate the\nincidence rate ratios associated with each risk factor, adjusted for age and sex. The\nassociation between risk factors and the risk of death among hospitalized cases was\nassessed using multivariable logistic regression to estimate the odds ratios associated\nwith each risk factor, adjusted for age and sex. In both analyses a spline function was\nused for age to allow for the possibly nonlinear effect of age on risk.\n\nWe used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate survival curves for death and the\nhospitalized fatality risk. We used the same approach to estimate the time to invasive\nmechanical ventilation. The censoring time of each recovered or nonventilated patient was\nset to 90 days. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the cumulative proportion of\nsubjects requiring invasive ventilation and with a fatal outcome were estimated using\nbootstrapping with 1000 resamples.\n\nWe used maximum likelihood to estimate the distribution of the number of days of\nhospitalization, and compared alternative parametric distributions including \u03b3,\nWeibull, and log-normal distributions, selecting the best parametric distribution on the\nbasis of the Akaike information criterion.\n\nAs of 6 August 2013, 133 laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H7N9) cases have been officially\nrecorded in mainland China. Among these, 123 requiring hospitalization for medical reasons\nwere included in this study [7]. Ten\nlaboratory-confirmed mild cases were excluded [14]. Data were included for 119 patients hospitalized with H5N1 (Vietnam =\n76; China = 43), and 3486 patients hospitalized with pH1N1.\n\nThe median age of subjects hospitalized with H7N9 was 63 years, compared to 26 years for\nH5N1 patients and 25 years for pH1N1 patients (P < .001). A higher\nproportion of H7N9 subjects were male compared with H5N1 (P = .019)\nor pH1N1 subjects (P = .001). Subjects hospitalized with H7N9 had\nthe highest prevalence of chronic medical conditions traditionally associated with an\nincreased risk of severe seasonal influenza disease (Table 1). CHD and diabetes were the commonest medical risk factors\nreported among H7N9 patients, and the prevalence of smoking and hypertension was higher in\nsubjects with H7N9 compared with the other patient groups. Pregnancy was more common in\nsubjects hospitalized with pH1N1. \n\nCompared with subjects without CHD, the presence of CHD was associated with an increased\nrisk of hospitalization with H7N9 (relative risk [RR], 9.68; 95% CI, 5.24\u201317.9;\nTable 2). CHD was also a risk factor for\nhospitalization with pH1N1 (RR, 16.51; 95% CI, 13.68\u201319.91). Hypertension was\nnot associated with an increased risk of hospitalization in any group, whereas a history of\nsmoking was associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization. Chronic renal disease was\nassociated with a reduced risk of hospitalization in H7N9 and pH1N1 patients. Once patients\nwere hospitalized, the odds of death were not significantly increased in subjects with any\nof the risk factors examined (Table 3).\n\n\n\nSigns and symptoms at hospital admission were compared for H7N9 and H5N1 cases. Subjects\nwith H7N9 virus infection were more likely to report a fever, a productive cough, and\nhemoptysis than those with H5N1 virus infection (Table 4). Gastrointestinal symptoms were most common in H5N1 cases.\n\n\nThe values of hematological, liver, and renal function tests, and markers of inflammation\non admission are shown in Table 5. H7N9 and\nH5N1 patients showed similar patterns of elevated alanine aminotransferase, creatinine\nkinase, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase, which were all significantly higher\nthan in pH1N1 patients. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were equally common in patients with\nH7N9 and H5N1 virus infections, and more common than in those with pH1N1 virus infection.\nLymphopenia was more common in patients with H7N9 compared with H5N1 (88% vs\n55%; P < .001), and neutropenia was more common in H5N1 patients.\nNeutrophilia was equally common in H5N1 and pH1N1 patients, and least common in H7N9\npatients. \n\nThe risk of invasive ventilation and death among hospitalized cases by influenza A virus\nsubtype are shown in Figure 1. The cumulative\nproportion of hospitalized subjects requiring invasive ventilation differs between subtypes,\nreaching 62% (95% CI, 53%\u201371%) for H7N9, 54%\n(95% CI, 45%\u201363%) for H5N1, and 17% (95% CI,\n15%\u201318%) for pH1N1. Among those ventilated, the interval from onset to\ninvasive ventilation was a median of 7 days for both H7N9 and H5N1 cases (P\n= .651), and 6 days for pH1N1 cases. The hospitalized case fatality risk was highest\nfor H5N1 (55%; 95% CI, 47%\u201364%) and death occurred\nearlier, with a median time from onset to death of 11 days for H5N1, compared with 15 days\nfor pH1N1 patients (P = .154) and 18 days for H7N9\n(P = .002). H7N9 patients were hospitalized for a longer duration\nthan either H5N1 (P < .001) or pH1N1 patients (P <\n.001) (Figure 2). \n\n\nOne of the most striking differences in this and other comparative analysis is the high\nmedian age of H7N9 patients [16]. This age\ndistribution is unlikely to be due to differences in humoral immunity as the prevalence of\nneutralizing antibodies to H7N9 virus is probably low in all ages [17\u201320]. It might\narise either because elderly people are more often exposed to the animal or environmental\nreservoir of H7N9 viruses, or because elderly people have a greater propensity to become\ninfected or severely ill following exposure. After adjusting for the age- and sex-specific\nprevalence of chronic illnesses in the general Chinese population, we found that CHD was\nassociated with an increased risk of hospitalization with H7N9 virus infection (RR, 9.68;\n95% CI, 5.24\u201317.9). The age distribution of H7N9 patients may therefore be\npartially explained by an increased propensity in persons with CHD (who are mostly older) to\ndevelop severe disease following infection with H7N9 virus. The overrepresentation of males\namong H7N9 patients may also be partially explained by this association, because in China\ncoronary heart disease is commoner in males than females (male prevalence, 0.74%;\nfemale prevalence, 0.51%) [10]. In\nagreement with our results, an age- and sex-matched case control study of 25 H7N9 cases has\nreported that the presence of a preexisting chronic medical condition (excluding\nhypertension) was associated with H7N9 disease (odds ratio, 5.1; 95% CI,\n1.5\u201316.9) [21]. Although only 11%\nof H7N9 patients reported a history of CHD, unrecognized CHD may have been present in some\nindividuals, and other unmeasured age-related factors, such as impaired innate and\ncell-mediated immunity, might also contribute to the observed age distribution of\nhospitalized H7N9 cases [17, 22, 23]. H7N9 viruses isolated from humans exhibit a mixed receptor specificity, binding\nboth \u03b12\u20136- and \u03b12\u20133-linked sialidases [3, 4, 20]. H7N9 virus can infect cells of both the upper\nand lower respiratory tract of humans and ferrets, and disease in ferrets is more severe\nfollowing intratracheal inoculation [5, 6, 20].\nThis raises the possibility that susceptibility of humans to severe H7N9 disease may be a\nconsequence of an impaired ability to control virus replication in the lower respiratory\ntract.\n\nA history of chronic renal disease was associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization\nwith H7N9 virus infection, but the number of patients with this condition was small, so this\nfinding should be interpreted with caution. A history of smoking was associated with a\nreduced risk of hospitalization with H7N9, H5N1, and pH1N1 virus infections. This is an\nunexpected finding that might be biased by inconsistent definitions and methods of\nascertaining smoking history, which were not standardized in the clinical datasets.\n\nThe clinical presentation and laboratory indices at hospital admission are similar for H7N9\nand H5N1 patients, except that a productive cough, hemoptysis, lymphopenia, and neutropenia\nwere more common in H7N9 patients. Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes\nare common in H5N1 patients and have been associated with more severe outcomes [9, 24\u201329]. A low absolute\nlymphocyte count has been associated with poor outcomes in patients hospitalized with pH1N1,\nH5N1, and severe acute respiratory syndrome [9,\n30\u201332]. The hematological and serum chemistry abnormalities suggest\nthat subjects hospitalized with H7N9 have a severe systemic illness. It remains to be\ndetermined if this is a consequence of severe pneumonia and poor tissue oxygenation or is\nthe result of an excessive inflammatory response (as is seen with H5N1 virus infection)\n[33]. High levels of chemokines and cytokines\nhave been identified in patients with H7N9 virus infection [20]. Extrapulmonary virus replication is an alternative explanation\nfor the severity of hospitalized H7N9 cases, but H7N9 virus does not posses the polybasic\namino acid motif at the HA cleavage site normally associated with extrapulmonary virus\nreplication, and experimental H7N9 virus infection of ferrets has provided little evidence\nof systemic replication [2, 34, 35]. H7N9 viral RNA has been detected in the serum, urine, and feces of H7N9\npatients but it is not known if this represents viral replication occurring outside of the\nrespiratory tract [35].\n\nHospitalized H7N9 patients had a case fatality risk that was intermediate between pH1N1 and\nH5N1 patients, and a more protracted clinical course than either H5N1 or pH1N1 patients,\nwith the longest median time to death and the longest hospitalization. Whether this reflects\nthe natural history of severe H7N9 virus infection, patient characteristics, or differences\nin the clinical management of patients with severe H7N9 compared with H5N1 patients,\nincluding increased frequency of rescue modalities such as extracorporeal membrane\noxygenation, is unknown.\n\nThe comparisons we have made are limited by a lack of standardization of the methods of\ncase ascertainment and inclusion, and of the recording of clinical and other data. As such,\nthe patients and data included in this study may be subject to unmeasured selection and\ninformation biases and differences in practices over time and between locations. However, we\nhave tried to minimize these potential biases by restricting our analysis only to\nhospitalized subjects and to variables where data were available for a reasonable proportion\nof all cases. Although the H5N1 patients from China and Vietnam had very similar demographic\ncharacteristics, underlying medical conditions, and behavioral risk factors, there were some\ndifferences in clinical presentation (Supplementary Data), and we cannot exclude that the clinical phenotype of H5N1\nvirus infections may be heterogeneous. We used univariate analysis that adjusted for age and\nsex to explore possible risk factors for hospitalization with H7N9; interactions effects\nwere not assessed and the estimated odds ratios and RRs might be confounded by other\nunmeasured confounders; as such, these risk factors should not be considered to be causal\nwithout further validation.\n\nIn conclusion, this comparative analysis shows that patients hospitalized with H7N9 virus\ninfection share some risk factors with those hospitalized with pH1N1 infection but have a\nclinical profile more closely resembling that of H5N1 patients. The identification in H7N9\npatients of known risk factors for severe seasonal influenza and the more protracted\nclinical course compared with H5N1 patients suggests that host factors may be an important\ncontributor to the severity of H7N9 virus infection. This is consistent with the observation\nthat there have probably been a large number of undetected mild H7N9 virus infections, and\nto date the patients with detected mild infection have been predominantly young (mean age,\n13 years) [7, 14]. H7N9 virus has recently reemerged in China. People with\nchronic medical conditions that are traditionally associated with a higher risk of severe\ncomplications following seasonal influenza virus infection should be targeted for preventive\ninterventions and for early treatment with antiviral drugs should they develop a respiratory\nillness."}
