{"title": "An adenoviral vector-based mucosal vaccine is effective in protection against botulism", "body": "Extremely potent botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) produced from the strictly anaerobic Gram-positive bacterium Clostridium botulinum (C. botulinum) are likely candidates to be used by terrorists. 1, 2 There are seven serotypes (A-G) of C. botulinum, each producing immunologically distinguishable neurotoxin variants, type A through G. 3 Human botulism mainly involves types A, B, E and F. 4 The BoNTs are the most deadly natural toxic substances known. 5, 6 The heavy chain of the BoNT is composed of N-terminal translocation domain and C-terminal receptor-binding domain. 4, 7 The 50-kDa C-terminal end of the heavy chain (H C 50) is responsible for specific toxin binding at neuromuscular junction. 7 Numerous previous studies have proved that the H C 50 subunits of BoNTs are non-toxic and antigenic, and are capable of eliciting immunity response against botulism. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] There is no licensed vaccine for protection of botulism, although a pentavalent botulinum toxoid (PBT) investigational new drug (IND) vaccine against type A through E is available. 10, 14 The vaccine is a mixture of chemically inactivated BoNTs that were produced from C. botulinum; concerns have been raised regarding safety in the process of producing the toxins, creating limitations in producing a timely supply. 7, 15, 16 To eliminate the risk and difficulty associated with producing a toxin-based vaccine, and alternative vaccine against botulism is being sought. To date, the most progress has occurred with a recombinant H C 50 subunit vaccine. 7, 10, 11, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] Replication-incompetent adenoviruses expressing vaccine antigens can be effectively delivered by either the parenteral or mucosal route. The transgene expression with adenovirus vectors is usually robust and can be further enhanced by driving gene expression with strong heterologous promoters. The vector genome does not insert into the host chromosome, ensuring safe delivery. In addition, adenoviruses can be grown to very high titers in qualified cell lines. [21] [22] [23] [24] These advantages make adenoviruses attractive vaccine vectors and they are being used widely in the development of vaccines against HIV, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), avian influenza, tuberculosis and anthrax. [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] In a previous study, we constructed a replication-incompetent adenoviral vector containing a synthesized condonoptimized gene encoding the H C 50 of BoNT type C (Ad/ opt-BoNT/C-H C 50) and evaluated its vaccine potential by intramuscular (i.m.) injection. 31 In this study, we use the same adenovirus-based vaccine delivered by the intranasal (i.n.) mucosal route and show that long-lasting protective immunity occurs after a single dose.\n\nThe immune response in sera after a single i.n. vaccination with varying doses of adenoviral vector Ad/ opt-BoNT/C-H C 50 is shown in Figure 1 . The preimmune sera (week 0) and sera from mice vaccinated with negative control vector (Ad/Null, adenovirus vector without transgene, data not shown) were negative. IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a responses to BoNT/C-H C 50 were detectable at week 2 for all three doses evaluated. Even at the lowest dose of Ad/opt-BoNT/C-H C 50 (1 \u00c2 10 5 p.f.u., plaque-forming unit), serum IgG levels were significantly higher than those of control mice receiving Ad/null (Po0.01). The time course of the response in serum for IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a to BoNT/ C-H C 50 in the vaccinated mice is also shown in Figure 1 . Overall, the dose ranging study showed that the serum IgG concentration in mice receiving 2 \u00c2 10 7 p.f.u. Ad/opt-BoNT/C-H C 50 was the highest.\n\nThe mice receiving 1 \u00c2 10 5 , 1 \u00c2 10 6 or 2 \u00c2 10 7 p.f.u./ mouse of Ad/opt-BoNT/C-H C 50 achieved serum anti-BoNT/C-H C 50 IgG concentrations of 6.83\u00b12.61, 24.14 \u00b1 7.32 and 28.86 \u00b1 6.81 mg ml \u00c01 , respectively, at week 2; 9.61\u00b14.87, 50.16\u00b119.11 and 68.49\u00b15.58 mg ml \u00c01 at week 4; and 22.59 \u00b1 6.67, 67.20 \u00b1 24.83 and 104.98 \u00b1 9.63 mg ml \u00c01 at week 6. Serum IgG antibodies against BoNT/C-H C 50 continued to increase with time from 2 to 6 weeks after vaccination ( Figure 1 ).\n\nThe IgG1 responses to BoNT/C-H C 50 in the mice 6 weeks after vaccination with Ad/opt-BoNT/C-H C 50 accounted for about three-fourths of the total IgG. IgG1 concentrations against BoNT/C-H C 50 in sera of vaccinated mice were significantly increased by week 2 compared with those in week 0. IgG2a antibody also was produced after vaccination, although of lower magnitude than IgG1 ( Figure 1 ).\n\nIn a separate experiment, we assessed antibody persistence after the single i.n. dose of 2 \u00c2 10 7 p.f.u./mouse of Ad/opt-BoNT/C-H C 50 adenoviral vector vaccine ( Figure 2 ). Measurements were made at 11, 19 and 27 weeks post vaccination for IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a. We found antibody levels persisted at levels similar to those at post week 6 after vaccination and they did not significantly decline between weeks 11 and 27; they showed the same IgG14IgG2a predominance as observed at post week 6.\n\nTo evaluate the mucosal immune response, we analyzed specific IgG and IgA antibody concentrations in saliva, nasal wash and vaginal wash samples after i.n. vaccination with Ad/opt-BoNT/C-H C 50 adenoviral vector vaccine. A single i.n. vaccination with 2 \u00c2 10 7 p.f.u./ mouse of Ad/opt-BoNT/C-H C 50 resulted in significant IgG and IgA antibody responses (Figure 3 ). At 2 weeks after vaccination, high local antibody responses were measurable, whereas no specific antibodies were detectable in the samples from control mice. All the examined antibody levels in the saliva, nasal wash and vaginal wash samples from vaccinated mice at week 4 were significantly higher than those at week 2. The BoNT/C-H C 50-specific IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a antibody concentrations in mucosal samples were lower than those in sera (Po0.01), and the ratio of IgG2a/IgG1 was reversed compared with that in serum (Po0.01). Mucosal anti-BoNT/C-H C 50 IgA in saliva reached 160.4\u00b150 ng ml \u00c01 at week 2 and 393 \u00b1 132 ng ml \u00c01 at week 4, whereas sera anti-BoNT/C-H C 50 IgA (data not shown) was not detectable. Gene-based mucosal vaccine against botulism Q Xu et al\n\nThe neutralization capacity of anti-sera from mice vaccinated with Ad/opt-BoNT/C-H C 50 adenoviral vector vaccine was determined using a mouse bioassay.\n\nOwing to the limited amount of serum available, the sera from eight vaccinated mice were pooled. The results are shown in Figure 4 . The neutralization titer from the mice receiving single doses of 2 \u00c2 10 7 p.f.u./mouse of Ad/opt-BoNT/C-H C 50 was 6.4 IU ml \u00c01 6 weeks after vaccination. The antiserum from these mice, diluted by p64fold, completely neutralized 100 \u00c2 50% mouse lethal dose (MLD 50 ) of BoNT/C resulting in a 100% survival. Serum from control mice did not neutralize the neurotoxin. To further show the vaccine potency for protection, higher doses of active BoNT/C up 10 5 \u00c2 MLD 50 were also used in toxin challenge. Figure 6 shows that animals i.n. vaccinated with 2 \u00c2 10 7 p.f.u. of Ad/opt-BoNT/C-H C 50 could be completely protected against challenge with 10 4 \u00c2 MLD 50 of BoNT/C 4 weeks after vaccination. However, the protection rate decreased to 14% (1/7 mice) when the BoNT/C toxin challenge dose increased to 10 5 \u00c2 MLD 50 . This shows the protective immunity is also toxin challenge dose dependent.\n\nTo determine the impact of preexisting anti-human Ad5 neutralization antibody on the efficacy of vaccination with Ad/opt-BoNT/C-H C 50, mice were pre-inoculated i.n. with 2 \u00c2 10 7 p.f.u. of wild-type Ad5 4 weeks before receiving Ad/opt-BoNT/C-H C 50 vaccine. Significant serum anti-Ad5 neutralizing antibody titers were produced ( Figure 7a ). The animals with preexisting immunity to Ad5 were then given a single i.n. dose of 2 \u00c2 10 7 p.f.u. of Ad/opt-BoNT/C-H C 50 and then 7 weeks after vaccination the animals were i.p. challenged with BoNT/C. All the vaccinated animals were fully protected against 100 \u00c2 MLD 50 BoNT/C challenge (Figure 7b ). In contrast, none of the control mice survived the toxin challenge (Figure 7b ). In addition, in an in vitro toxin neutralization assay, we found that a single dose of our vaccine elicited the same titers of anti-toxin antibody responses (titer, 6.4 IU ml \u00c01 ) regardless of host preexisting immunity to the adenoviral vector ( Figure 4) . These data suggest that Ad/opt-BoNT/C-H C 50 vector could \n\nThe neurotoxins produced by C. botulinum are among the most potent poisons known and there is a need to prepare for their use in a bioterrorism attack. 1,2 Naturally, human botulism mainly involves BoNT types A, B, E and F, 4 and serotypes C and D mostly affect domestic animals. Given the ease of preparation and potential toxicity of all these neurotoxins, it is equally important to develop vaccines against all these toxins for biodefense. In this study, we evaluated the vaccination strategy against the BoNT/C and expect ultimately to apply the same platform to develop vaccines against all serotypes of BoNTs. Here, we have described a novel adenoviral vector delivery of a botulism vaccine against type C neurotoxin that when delivered as a single i.n. dose proved to be a highly effective vaccine. Owing to the single i.n. route of vaccination, this vaccine could be selfadministered to protect the population in the event of terrorist attack with C. botulism or neurotoxins. In addition to the ease of administration and rapid onset of protection described here, the vaccine could be produced inexpensively, in high quantity and in a short time frame. We chose H C 50 fragment of BoNT type C because the H C 50 subunits of BoNTs are non-toxic and antigenic, and are capable of eliciting immunity responses against botulism. 8,10-12 Also in a previous study we showed that i.m. vaccination with Ad/opt-BoNT/C-H C 50 elicited strong systemic immunity that lasted at least 27 weeks and mice receiving the vaccine were fully protected against BoNT/C challenge. 31 BoNTs can be lethal by ingestion of minute amounts in food and/or by inhalation. The latter delivery mode is the strongest bioterrorism-related threat. 32, 33 The mucosal immune system is the first line of defense against botulism. However, the current injection-type botulism toxoid vaccine only provides protective immunity in the systemic compartment. Clearly, the development of a safe and effective mucosal vaccine should be a high priority against bioterrorism-related botulism. 34 Previous research by Kobayashi et al. 35 showed that nasal vaccination with BoNT/A toxoid plus a mutant of cholera toxin (E112K) effectively prevents mucosal BoNT intoxication in mice. Maddaloni et al. 36 recently showed that mucosal vaccination with adenovirus type 2 fiber fused with H C 50 of BoNT/A elicited robust mucosal antibody response, and addition of cholera toxin (CT) as an adjuvunt in the vaccine further enhanced protective immunity in mice against challenge with active BoNT/A. These studies proved the feasibility for developing a nasal vaccine against botulism. Adenoviruses invade their host naturally through the mucosa surface, notably in the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract. 37 Adenoviral vector vaccines can be effectively delivered by i.n. mucosal route and can induce strong adaptive immune responses in mammalian hosts. 21, 22 The replicationincompetent adenoviral vector Ad/opt-BoNT/C-H C 50 studied here given as a protective, single i.n. vaccination elicited not only high serum antibody response to BoNTC/H C 50 but also high specific antibody response in mucosal secretions.\n\nProtection against botulism neurotoxin is expected to be antibody-mediated and antibody levels have been correlated with protection. 17, 19 The mice receiving Ad/ opt-BoNT/C-H C 50 developed high and persistent serum neutralization titers and high mucosal antibody levels. A functional antibody response that neutralized active BoNT was shown in our experiments and, in protection against BoNT/C in the vaccinated animals, was shown to persist for at least 27 weeks. In future studies, we plan to determine whether toxin-specific mucosal antibodies are protective. We will measure toxin neutralizing antibody titers in mucosal secretions after mucosal immunization and perform toxin challenge through nasal and the mucosal route in addition to i.p. route. \n\nOther studies have established that preexisting antiadenovirus antibody may drastically reduce the intake of adenovirus-vectored vaccines, 21,38-40 but immunity to the vector has been overcome in some situations. 23, 41, 42 Our challenge experiments indicate that preexisting anti-adenovirus immunity did not reduce the 100% protection in vaccinated mice, similar to our previous results after i.m. vaccination. 31 To make our observation more convincing, similar experiments with higher doses of toxin for challenge and with lower doses of our vaccine in mice with preexisting immunity to adenovirus would be helpful.\n\nIn summary, in this study we have shown for the first time that a single i.n. vaccination of an adenovirus-based vector encoding a humanized H C 50-kDa of BoNT/C can elicit systemic and mucosa immunity responses and provide full protection in vaccinated mice against BoNT type C. The protective immunity can last at least 27 weeks and is not compromised by preexisting antibody to adenovirus. Together with our previous results with i.m. vaccination, the adenoviruses vector platform deserves further study as a multivalent vaccine against all serotypes of BoNTs.\n\nA replication-incompetent human adenovirus serotype 5 vector Ad/opt-BoNT/C-H C 50 expressing H C 50 of BoNT/C, and a control vector Ad/Null (adenovirus vector with no transgene) were constructed using the AdEasy System (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) as described previously. 31, 43, 44 The vector Ad/opt-BoNT/ C-H C 50 contained a synthesized human codon-optimized gene encoding the H C 50 of BoNT type C1 45 and a native gene encoding the signal peptide of human tissue plasminogen activator (PLAT) (amino acids 1-25, GenBank accession no. BC002795). The recombinant adenoviruses were produced in AD293 cells (Stratagene), purified by CsCl gradients centrifugation and stored in 1.0 M sucrose in a \u00c080 1C freezer, their titers (p.f.u.) were determined by plaque assay.\n\nAnimals, treatments, sample collection and challenge BALB/c mice (female, 5-6 weeks old), purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA), were housed in the animal facility of University of Rochester Medical Center, four animals per cage. All experimental tests were carried out in accordance with the US Public Health Service Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NRC Publication, 1996 ed.) and other related federal statutes and regulations in Animal Welfare Act.\n\nVaccination dose-dependent test. To evaluate an optimal dose, 40 mice were allotted into 4 experimental groups and two control groups, 8 mice per group. The animals were vaccinated by i.n. inhalation with Ad/opt-BoNT/C-H C 50 adenoviral vector at doses of 1 \u00c2 10 4 , 1 \u00c2 10 5 , 1 \u00c2 10 6 and 2 \u00c2 10 7 p.f.u./mouse, respectively, in the experimental groups, and Ad/Null at a dose of 2 \u00c2 10 7 p.f.u./mouse in the negative control group. In the positive control group, mice were injected i.m. with the botulinum toxoid adsorbed pentavalent vaccine (ABCDE) (50 ml/mouse), an IND vaccine that was produced by the Michigan Department of Public Health. Serum samples were obtained at weeks 0, 2, 4 and 6 and stored at \u00c020 1C until further assayed. The vaccinated mice were i.p. challenged with BoNT 1 week after the last bleeding as described in the following section.\n\nSaliva, nasal wash and vagina wash specimens. For these experiments, 16 mice were divided into 2 test groups and 2 control groups, 8 mice per group. The animals were vaccinated with 2 \u00c2 10 7 p.f.u./mouse of Ad/opt-BoNT/C-H C 50 in the test groups and same amount of Ad/Null in the control groups at week 0; saliva, nasal wash and vaginal wash samples were collected at week 2 in one test group and one control group, and at week 4 in one test group and one control group at each time point. The mice were anesthetized by i.p. injection with 2 mg of ketamine HCl (Bedford Laboratories, Bedford, OH, USA) plus 0.2 mg of xylazine (Butler Company, Columbus, OH, USA). Vaginal washes were collected by flushing the vagina with 100 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) by repeated aspiration using a pipette with an animal feeding needle (with a ball head) until turbid. 46 The saliva samples were collected using a 200-ml pipette fitted with a plastic tip, after i.p. injection of carbachol (Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO, USA; 10 mg in 0.1 ml), to stimulate salivation as described previously. 47, 48 The mice were then incised ventrally along the median line from the xiphoid process to the chin, the heads were removed and the lower jaws were excised. A hypodermic needle was inserted into the posterior opening of the nasopharynx and 200 ml of PBS was injected repeatedly to collect the nasal wash samples. 49 Challenge with BoNT. The vaccinated and control mice were i.p. challenged with 10 2 -10 5 \u00c2 MLD 50 of C. botulinum neurotoxin BoNT/C (Metabiolgics Inc., Madison, WI, USA) per mouse as specified in each experiment. The challenged animals were monitored every 4 h for the first 2 days and twice a day thereafter for total 7 days. The number of deaths for each group was recorded as the end point. 31, 50 Long-term protective immunity trial. In these experiments, 48 mice were allotted into 3 test groups and 3 control groups, 8 mice per group. The animals were i.n. vaccinated at week 0 with Ad/opt-BoNT/C-H C 50 vector at doses of 2 \u00c2 10 7 p.f.u./mouse in test groups, and Ad/Null at the same dosage in the control groups. One test group and one control group mice were challenged with BoNT/C at weeks 11, 19 and 27, respectively. The serum samples were obtained at week 0 and 1 week before challenge.\n\nVaccination efficacy test under preexisting immunity to adenovirus. A total of 12 mice were allotted into one experimental group (8 mice) and one control group (4 mice). All animals were i.n. inoculated with widetype human adenovirus serotype 5 (WT Ad5; ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) at a dose of 2 \u00c2 10 7 p.f.u./mouse, and then vaccinated by nasal inhalation at week 4 with Ad/opt-BoNT/C-H C 50 vector at a dose of 2 \u00c2 10 7 p.f.u./ mouse in the experimental group and Ad/Null at the same dose in the control group. The serum samples were \n\nNeutralization titer of mice sera to BoNT/C was determined as described previously. 31 Briefly, the sera from eight mice 6 weeks after vaccination with Ad/opt-BoNT/C-H C 50 (2 \u00c2 10 7 p.f.u./mouse) were pooled, and then diluted in twofold series in PBS. Active BoNT/C was added into each dilution, followed by incubation at room temperature for 1 h. A mouse was injected i.p with the mixture of anti-serum and the BoNT/C corresponding 100 \u00c2 MLD 50 of BoNT/C before neutralization, four mice for each dilution. The animals were monitored for 4 days, and the number of deaths at each sample dilution was recorded. The animal survived from 100 \u00c2 MLD 50 of BoNT/C when the toxin was neutralized. Neutralizing antibody titers was defined as the maximum number of IU of antitoxin per ml of serum, resulting in 100% survival after challenge. One IU of type C antitoxin neutralizes 10 000 \u00c2 MLD 50 . 11, 51 Anti-adenovirus neutralizing antibody titer assay\n\nAnti-adenovirus neutralizing antibody titers were evaluated using a modification of a previously described method. 31, [52] [53] [54] Briefly, AD293 cells (Stratagene) were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 10 4 cells/well in 200 ml of Eagle's minimum essential medium (EMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and incubated at 37 1C, 5% CO 2 overnight before infection. Mouse sera were serially twofold diluted in EMEM containing 2% FBS after heat-inactivated at 55 1C for 45 min. A volume of 50 ml (10 4 p.f.u.) human WT Ad5 was prepared in EMEM containing 2% FBS and then combined with 50 ml of each diluted serum sample before an 1-h incubation at 37 1C. The virus-serum mixture was subsequently added to AD293 cells and incubated for 2 h at 37 1C. After the incubation, the virus-serum medium was replaced with 200 ml of EMEM containing 10% FBS. The cells were incubated at 37 1C until the negative wells (without antiserum) exhibited 90% cytopathic effect. The anti-Ad5 neutralizing antibody titer was defined as the reciprocal of maximum antiserum dilution that allowed 490% of cells to remain viable relative to the control.\n\nSerum and mucosal antibody concentrations among different groups at different time points were compared using the LSD test, ANOVA/MANOVA (analysis of variance/multivariate analysis of variance) with Statistica 7.1 software (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK, USA). In comparing groups, those with P-values o0.05 and o0.01 were considered to be significant and very significant, respectively."}
