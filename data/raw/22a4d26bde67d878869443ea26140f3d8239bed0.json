{"title": "Dissecting genetic and sex-specific host heterogeneity in pathogen transmission 1 potential 2 3 4", "body": "Individual host heterogeneity in disease spread is commonly observed across a wide 35 range of infectious diseases (Woolhouse et al., 1997 with DCV, flies were pricked in the pleural suture with a 0.15mm diameter pin, bent 146 at 90\u00ba ~0.5mm from the tip, dipped in DCV. 147 at death was measured for n=17-20, three treatment groups consisted of n=7-15 flies 155 (Table S1) . to tubes for 24 hours, immediately following 1 or 2 days after systemic infection. After 163 living in these tubes for a further 24 hours, flies were removed and homogenised in 164 50\u03bcl of TRI-reagent, tubes were also washed out with 50\u03bcl of TRI-reagent by 165\n\nvortexing. These samples were then frozen at -70\u00b0C, to await DCV quantification by 166 qPCR. For each combination of sex and genetic background over the three days vial 167 load and virus shedding was measured, n=7-15 flies were measured (Table S2-S4) . Chloroform extraction. Samples were thawed on ice for 30 minutes before being 172 incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes to allow dissociation of nucleo-protein 173 complex. Samples were then centrifuged at 12,000\u00d7g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C after 174 which large debris was removed. For phase separation, samples were shaken 175 vigorously for 15 seconds, 10\u03bcl of chloroform added, incubated at room temperature 176 for a further 3 minutes before being centrifuged at 12,000\u00d7g for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C. 177\n\nFollowing phase separation, the upper aqueous layer was removed from each 178 sample and added to 25\u03bcl of isopropanol, tubes were then inverted twice, before 179 being centrifuged at 12,000\u00d7g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Precipitated RNA was then 180 washed by removing the supernatant, and re-dissolving the RNA pellet in 50\u03bcl of 75% 181 ethanol before being centrifuged at 7,500\u00d7g for 5 minutes at 4\u00b0C. RNA suspension 182 was achieved by removing 40\u03bcl of the ethanol supernatant, allowing the rest to dry 183 by evaporation and dissolving the remaining RNA pellet in 20\u03bcl of RNase-free water. 184\n\nWe extracted RNA from flies after 1, 2 or 3 days of infection using a semi-automatic 185 absolute quantification, using a standard curve created from a 10-fold serial dilution 201\n\n(1-10 -12 ) of DCV cDNA. Our detection threshold was calculated for each plate using 202 the point at which two samples on our standard curve gave the same Ct value. The 203 point of redundancy in a standard curve was taken to be equivalent to 0 viral 204 particles. Due to our detection protocol measuring viral copies of RNA, we cannot 205 comment on the viability of any detected virus. We transformed our measurements of 206 viral RNA transformed in order for them to represent the amount of virus growing 207 inside a whole fly rather than the amount in the qPCR well sample. To account for 208\n\nCalculating Between-Individual Variation in Transmission Potential, V 213\n\nWe used measures of virus shedding, lifespan following infection, and social 214 aggregation to predict individual transmission potential. We integrated these 215 measures based on a simple framework that describes transmission potential as a 216 function of contact rate between susceptible and infected individuals, the likelihood 217 that such contact will result in infection, and the duration of the infectious period 218 (VanderWaal & Ezenwa, 2016). Using previously analysed data on social aggregation 219 (Siva-Jothy & Vale, 2019), we used nearest neighbour distance as a measure of 220 contact rate. Flies that aggregated more closely to conspecifics, have a higher 221 contact rate, and are therefore more likely to spread DCV. We also assume that 222 transmission likelihood increases with virus shedding. We therefore take the amount proportions. An effect of sex or mating was analysed in separate models comparing 240 males or virgin females to the same dataset of mated females, respectively. 241\n\nTo analyse lifespan, two GLMs were constructed containing a three-way interaction 243 genetic background, VLAD, and sex or mating (Table S6 ). The two GLMs for VLAD, 244\n\ncontained either a two-way interaction between genetic background and sex or a 245 two-way interaction between genetic background and mating (Table S6) . regressions analysing sex-differences in viral load included DPI (a 3-level factor: 1, 2 253 or 3 days) and an interaction between genetic background and sex (Table S6 ). For 254 analysing the effect of mating in females on viral load, logistic regressions included 255 DPI and an interaction between genetic background and mating (Table S6 ). Logistic 256 regressions of virus shedding used a similar model that also included quantitative 257 viral load as a predictor (Table S6 ). After these logistic regressions, zeroes were 258 removed from all datasets to analyse the subset of positive-values. The GLMs used 259 to analyse these subsets included the same predictors as their corresponding logistic 260 regressions, for viral load: an interaction between genetic background and sex or 261 mating, alongside DPI, with the inclusion of quantitative viral load for virus shedding 262 (Table S6) . 263 264 Due to zero-inflation V was also analysed with a logistic regression followed by a 265 GLM. A logistic regression was used to analyse the proportion of V values that were 266 greater than zero with a two-way interaction between sex and genetic background 267 as predictors (Table S6) . Zero-values of V were then removed from the dataset, and 268 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Interactions with sex and mating also 283 explained a further 2.7% and 1.5%, respectively ( Figure 5 ; Table 1 ). We found no 284 evidence that mating affected the lifespan of females following DCV infection ( Figure  285 1a; Table 1 ). Viral load at death (VLAD) was not affected by genetic background, sex 286 or female mating status ( Figure 1b ; Table 2 ), and flies that died sooner following 287 infection had greater VLAD than those that died later ( Figure 1c ; Table 1) .

These zero-values 303 reflect qualitative variation and are likely caused by viral titres below the detection 304 threshold of our qPCR and therefore reflect individuals with very low DCV loads, or 305 no virus at all. We found extensive genetic variation in qualitative DCV load ( Figure  306 2a; Table 3 ) which was affected by sex ( Figure 2a ; Table 3 ) and female mating status 307 ( Figure 2a ; Table 3 ). Relatively little deviance was explained by sex (0.002%), mating 308 (0.13%), or genetic background in models testing sex (1.18%) and mating (2.83%) 309\n\neffects. The predictors that explained the most deviance were the interactions 310 between genetic background and sex (5.58%) or mating (4.92%) ( Figure 5 ; Table 3) . 311\n\nThe size of non-zero DCV loads reflects quantitative variation and was affected by 312 similar interactions between mating and sex with genetic background (Figure 2b ; 313 Table 4 ). While <1% of variance was explained by sex and mating, much more was 314 explained by genetic background (7.94% and 11%) alongside its interactions with 315 sex (19.2%) and mating (4.38%) ( Figure 5 ; Table 4 ). Table 5 ). Sex however, explained <1% of the deviance, while genetic 341 background and its interaction with sex explained 2.2% and 3.07% ( Figure 5 ). Mating 342 did not affect qualitative DCV shedding (Figure 3a ; Table 5 ) and explained <1% of 343 the deviance ( Figure 5 ; Table 5 ). In flies where DCV was detected in shedding, 344 quantitative DCV shedding was affected by genetic background and the extent of 345 this variation was determined by female mating status, but not sex ( Figure 3b ; Table  346 6). The amount of variance explained by sex and in our models was <1%, in 347 comparison with genetic background (9.48% and 5.82%) and its interactions with sex 348 (8.87%) or mating (6.53%) ( Figure 5 ; Table 6 ). Qualitative and quantitative DCV 349 shedding peaked at day 2 (Figures 3a; Tables 5 & 6, pairwise comparisons,  350 p<0.0001). Across all treatment groups, there was no significant relationship between 351 viral load and shedding ( Figure S1 ; Table 6 ). The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/733915 doi: bioRxiv preprint Table 7 ). Sex (0.28%), genetic 374 background (2.3%) and the interaction between the two (2.83%) explained relatively 375 little deviance in our models ( Figure 5 ; Table 7 ). In quantitative variation in V, sex 376 explained <1%, while genetic background and its interaction with sex explained 377 4.13% and 11.4% of variance respectively ( Figure 5 ; Table 8) . We also observed clear qualitative and quantitative differences in V between males and 473 females, which is suggestive of sex-specific variation in disease transmission. While the 474 extent of any difference between males and females is also determined by genetic 475 background, a greater proportion of males tend to transmit DCV than females across 476 these backgrounds. In DCV shedding, a greater proportion of males from several genetic 477 backgrounds (RAL-379, RAL-738 and RAL-818) shed DCV than females (Figure 3a) . Sex-specific variation in qualitative differences in shedding exerts a significant influence 489 over shedding (Figure 3a) . It is important to note however, that in isolation, sex accounts 490 for a miniscule 0.64% of the deviance in qualitative variation in shedding. Sex appears to 491 play a more important role in conjunction with genetic background, the interaction 492 between the two explaining 3.07% of deviance ( Figure 5 ). While significant, sex-specific 493 variation may play a relatively minor role in shedding. A variety of factors appear to 494 underlie sex-differences in shedding across host-pathogen systems. For example, male-495 biased infection is common to many mammal hosts but generally absent from arthropod 496 hosts (Sheridan et al., 2000) . In the water flea, Daphnia magna, parasite spores are 497 released into the environment upon death and females have been shown to release 498 significantly more than males (Thompson et al., 2017) . In the vole, Microtus gryalis, the 499 faeces of females contains significantly more parasite eggs than that of males (Sanchez 500 et al., 2011) . Given that we see female-biased mortality to DCV infection (Figure 1a) , it is 501 perhaps surprising that shedding is not also female-biased. This could be due to 502 .

We might therefore see sex-differences in shedding during the later 504 stages of infection. 505\n\nBoth the qualitative and quantitative differences in V between males and females were 507 determined alongside genetic background. While sex explained very little deviance and 508 variance in qualitative and quantitative variation in V (Figure 6 ), its interaction with genetic 509 background explained 2.83% and 11.4 %, respectively. Sex could therefore be an is thought to be driven by sex differences in contact network connectivity, which has 521 been linked to testosterone production (Foo, Nakagawa, Rhodes, & Simmons, 2017; 522\n\nMated and virgin females did not qualitatively differ in DCV shedding; however, individuals 528 did exhibit quantitative variation in shedding. While only 0.098% of the variance in 529 quantitative shedding was explained by mating, the interaction between mating and 530 genetic background explained 8.87% of the variance ( Figure 5 ). This suggests that 531 alongside host genetic background, mating might exert an important level of influence 532 over shedding. One potential explanation for this mating effect are post-mating 533 physiological changes in the intestine that can increase in defecation rates (Apger-534\n\nMcGlaughon and Wolfner, 2013). However, if this change is responsible for the significant 535 effect of female mating, the virgin females from particular genetic backgrounds that shed 536 more than mated females (Figure 3b ) may be tolerant to these physiological changes.
