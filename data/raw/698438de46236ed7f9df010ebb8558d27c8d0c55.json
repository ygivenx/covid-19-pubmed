{"title": "Enantioselective synthesis and antiviral activity of purine and pyrimidine cyclopentenyl C-nucleosides", "body": "Synthesis of C-nucleoside and carbocyclic nucleoside analogs has been inspired by their interesting biological activities as well as chemical and enzymatic stability. C-Nucleosides are a unique class of compounds in which the heterocycle is connected to the sugar moiety by a C-C bond instead of a C-N bond of the natural nucleosides. As a result, they are resistant to the chemical and enzymatic hydrolytic cleavage of the glycosidic bond. C-Nucleosides have received considerable attention due not only to their chemical stability, but also for their interesting biological activities of naturally occurring compounds such as showdomycin, formycins, oxazinomycin, pyrazomycin, etc. 1 Also several biologically active synthetic C-nucleosides such as 9-deazaadenosine, 2 pseudoisocytidine, 3 and thiazofurin 4 have been reported to possess both antitumor and antiviral activities. Carbocyclic nucleosides are another class of metabolically stable nucleosides, in which a methylene group replaces the oxygen in the furan ring of the natural nucleosides. 5 The natural carbocyclic nucleosides such as neplanocin 6 and aristeromycin 7 were isolated from microorganisms and were found to possess various biological activities including antiviral and antitumor activities. The synthetic carbocyclic nucleosides, abacavir, 8 entecavir, 9 and lobucavir, 10 have shown promising antiviral activities. Recently, abacavir and entecavir were approved by the FDA as an anti-HIV agent and anti-hepatitis B virus agent, respectively.\n\nOn the basis of these chemical and biological properties of C-nucleosides and carbocyclic nucleosides, it was of interest to synthesize hybrid nucleosides, carbocyclic C-nucleosides. Although some carbocyclic nucleosides and C-nucleosides are naturally occurring, so far no natural carbocyclic C-nucleosides have been identified. The history of the synthesis of carbocyclic C-nucleosides dates back to 1960s. 11 Despite the long history of both carbocyclic and C-nucleosides, only a few carbocyclic C-nucleosides have been synthesized, 12 probably due to the synthetic difficulties of these nucleosides. As part of our ongoing program toward synthesis of novel nucleosides, we were exploring the synthesis of cyclopentenyl carbocyclic nucleosides with unnatural bases. 13 Therefore, it was of great interest to synthesize optically Chemistry 15 (2007) [839] [840] [841] [842] [843] [844] [845] [846] active carbocyclic C-nucleosides, possessing a cyclopentenyl moiety as analogs of neplanocin. Herein, we report the enantiomeric synthesis of purine and pyrimidine cyclopentenyl C-nucleosides 1-4 ( Fig. 1 ) from the key intermediate, 2,3-(isopropylidenedioxy)-4-(trityloxymethyl)-4-cyclopenten-1-ol (5), and their antiviral activities.\n\nFor the synthesis of target purine and pyrimidine carbocyclic C-nucleosides, we utilized the key intermediate 5 as a chiral starting material, which was prepared from D D-ribose in eight steps using recently reported procedure from our group. 13a In order to synthesize 9-deazaneplanocin A (1) (Scheme 1), the key intermediate 5 was converted to mesylate 6, followed by SN 2 reaction with ethylcyanoacetate in the presence of sodium hydride to give compound 7 in 52% yield plus disubstituted product 8 in 10% yield. The optimal temperature was found to be 55\u00b0C for this reaction, since at 70\u00b0C the starting material decomposed. The assignment of b-configuration of 7 was performed by proton NOE experiments. 13a Selective reduction of ester group of 7 with DIBAL-H, followed by condensation with aminoacetonitrile bisul-fate in the presence of sodium acetate, gave the pyrrole precursor 9. 12a Protection of the amino nitrogen of 9 as a carbamate with ethylchloroformate followed by cyclization catalyzed by 1, 8-diazabicyclo[5.4 .0]-undec-7-ene (DBU) and subsequent deprotection of carbamate with sodium carbonate led to the substituted pyrrole 10. Condensation of 10 with formamidine acetate in ethanol yielded the protected 9-deazaneplanocin 11 in 61%, which was deprotected with methanolic hydrochloric acid to afford the target compound, 9-deazaneplanocin A (1).\n\nTo synthesize the carbocyclic 9-deazaguanosine (2) (Scheme 1), substituted ethylcyanoacetate 7 was treated with DIBAL-H followed by condensation with ethylglycinate hydrochloride in the presence of sodium acetate to provide 12. N-Protection of 12 with ethyl chloroformate, followed by ring closure with DBU and subsequent deprotection of carbamate, provided 13. Treatment of 13 with N-benzoylisothiocyanate and methyl iodide, followed by treatment with methanolic ammonia in a steel bomb at 95\u00b0C, gave the protected carbocyclic 9-deazaguanosine (14) in 64% yield. Deprotection of 14 with methanolic hydrochloric acid gave the target compound 2.\n\nThe carbocyclic isocytosine (3) Preparation of the carbocyclic pseudouridine analog 4 was accomplished from 16 in three steps (Scheme 2). Compound 16 was treated with lithium diisopropylamide and ethylformate, followed by methyl iodide in DMF, to give the, compound 18 15 in 64% yield, which was condensed with urea in the presence of potassium tert-butoxide to afford 19. Deprotection of 19 with methanolic hydrochloric acid gave the target compound 4 in 72% yield. All the compound structures were assigned based on NMR, UV, mass spectroscopy, and elemental analysis.\n\nThe synthesized carbocyclic C-nucleosides 1-4 were tested for anti-HIV activity as well as cytotoxicity using AZT as the positive control, and the results are summarized in Table 1 . Anti-HIV activity was determined in \n\nND, not determined. human peripheral blood mononuclear (PBM) cells infected with HIV-1 (strain LAI). Among the synthesized nucleosides, only 9-deazaneplanocin A (1) showed moderate anti-HIV-1 activity (EC 50 2.0 lM) and the other compounds did not display any anti-HIV activity.\n\nCompounds 1-4 were also evaluated against a wide variety of viruses, including vaccinia, cowpox, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Punta Toro virus, West Nile virus, yellow fever, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus, Tacaribe, Venezulean equine encephalitis, Dengue, and hepatitis C. Compounds 2 (EC 50 2.5 lM) and 4 (EC 50 65 lM) showed moderate activity against Punta Toro virus (strain Adames, LLC-MK2 cell line) without any cytotoxicity. Compound 3 was slightly active against West Nile virus (New York isolate) (EC 50 11 lM) and compound 4 (EC 50 49 lM) showed marginal activity against SARS-CoV ( Table 2) . None of other compounds showed any antiviral activity against all other tested viruses.\n\nIn summary, enantioselective synthesis of purine and pyrimidine cyclopentenyl C-nucleosides 1-4 was achieved from the common key intermediate 5, which was prepared from commercially available D D-ribose.\n\nSynthesized compounds were tested as potential antiviral agents. However, only 9-deazaneplanocin A (1) exhibited moderate anti-HIV activity.\n\nMelting points were determined on a Mel-temp II apparatus and are uncorrected. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova 500 spectrometer at 500 MHz for 1 H NMR and 125 MHz for 13 C NMR with tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. Chemical shifts (d) are reported as s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), m (multiplet), or br s (broad singlet). UV spectra were recorded on a Beckman DU-650 spectrometer. Optical rotations were measured on a Jasco DIP-370 digital polarimeter. High-resolution mass spectra were recorded on a Micromass Autospec high-resolution mass spectrometer.

After stirring at \u00c078\u00b0C for an additional hour, the mixture was warmed up to 0\u00b0C and allowed to stir for 12 h at rt. The resulting mixture was evaporated to dryness and the residue was dissolved in dry DMF (15 mL) and treated with MeI (0.98 mL, 15.83 mmol) under nitrogen. After stirring for 4 h at rt, DMF was removed under reduced pressure and water (30 mL) was added, extracted with ethyl acetate (2\u00b7 100 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with brine (50 mL), dried over MgSO 4 , concentrated under reduced pressure, and purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane-EtOAc = 9:1) to give 18 (1.82 g, 64%) as a white solid.
