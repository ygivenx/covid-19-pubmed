The infection of SARS virus is initiated by the attachment of S protein to the receptor ACE2 19 , followed by cleavage with host cell protease TMPRSS2 [20] [21] [22] . The viruses are then transported through the early and late endosomes, subsequently endo/lysosomes, during which host protein extracellular proteases including cathepsin L mediates the further cleavage of S protein the author/funder.

The activated S protein will then activate the fusion between viral and cell membranes and release the genome of SARS-CoV into cytoplasm.\n\nIn 2016, our team had found that teicoplanin, a routinely-used clinical glycopeptide antibiotics, significantly inhibited the cellular entry of Ebola virus, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV 27 . Further mechanistic studies showed that teicoplanin blocked virus entry by specifically inhibiting the activity of cathepsin L, opening a novel avenue for the development of glycopeptides as potential inhibitors of cathepsin L-dependent viruses. In this study, we have compared the cleavage site of cathepsin L in 2019-nCoV with that in SARS-CoV and found it is well conserved. Furthermore, we identified that teicoplanin also potently inhibited the entry of 2019-nCoV pseudovirus, which provide a possible strategy to the prophylaxis and treatment for2019-nCoV infection.\n\nThe plasmid containing spike (S) gene of 2019-nCoV was purchased from Generay Biotech company (Shanghai, China) and inserted into pcDNA3.1 vector.

Consensus sequences were created using the BioEdit software (http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/bioedit/bioedit.html) based on the multiple alignment of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV, respectively.

Accordingly, we infected the cells with SARS-CoV-, or 2019-nCoV -S-pseudotyped HIV-1 viruses after siRNA-mediated knockdown of the expression of cathepsin L and TMPRSS2 and found that both cathepsin L and TMPRSS2 depletion impaired the cell entry of pseudoviruses ( Figure 1C ), indicating that both the author/funder.

As we have previously demonstrated that several glycopeptide antibiotics, including teicoplanin and dalbavancin, exhibited specific inhibitory effects on cathepsin L, we therefore hypothesized that teicoplanin and its homologs could also inhibit the entry of 2019-nCoV.\n\nThe data illustrated that the dalbavancin also repressed the entry of 2019-nCoV in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 3C ). However, vancomycin, another routinely-used antibiotics, did not inhibit the 2019-nCoV entry Teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic, which is mainly used for serious infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus [36] [37] [38] . As a routinely-used clinical antibiotics, teicoplanin is well known for its much low toxic and side effects, long half-life in blood plasma, convenient administration, and high safety when used in combination with other antibiotics. The recommended plasma concentration of teicoplanin for clinical use to inhibit Gram-positive bacteria is 15 mg / L, or 8.78 \u03bcM, and the commonly used dose is 400 mg / day. Here we found the IC 50 inhibition of 2019-nCOV was only 1.66 u\u039c, which is much lower than the routine clinical drug concentration. Therefore, the routinely-used dose (400 mg / the author/funder. All rights reserved.

If the effect is not significant, dose could be optimized because of its low toxicity. The doses such as 800 mg / day or 1200 mg / day could be considered to improve the drug efficiency. Given that the principle of antiviral therapy is to prevent virus infection and amplification at a stage as early as possible, it is reasonable to recommend the use of teicoplanin \n\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.

After binding of virus to the cellular receptor ACE2, the proteolytic process was initialed by TMPRSS2 on the cellular membrane. The virions will be up-taken into endosomes, where the S protein is further activated by cleavage with cysteine protease cathepsin L. The cleavage of S protein by cathepsin L can be significantly blocked by teicoplanin. the author/funder. All rights reserved.
