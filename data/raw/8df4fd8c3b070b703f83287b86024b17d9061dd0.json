{"title": "", "body": "The wide variety of different viruses involved prevents protective immunity. The viruses adhere to cell surface proteins, e.g. on cilia;\n\nenter the cells and replicate and kill them\n\nA wide variety, of which the major types are:\n\n(i) rhinoviruses responsible for more than half of cases of the common cold; (ii) coronaviruses (iii) myxoviruses, (e.g. influenza), paramyxoviruses (e.g. respiratory syncytial virus) can also invade the lower respiratory tract. \n\nThis common respiratory inflammation usually involves the nose and adjacent structures.\n\nThe 2 phases, viral and bacterial, are typically seen in this disease.\n\nThe drainage from the sinuses, especially the maxillary, is often blocked by swelling of the mucosagiving rise to sinusitis.\n\nThe infection is acquired by droplet spread of viruses by sneezing.\n\nThe repeated attacks frequently lead to chronic changes in the mucosa with polyp formation.\n\nVery often the submucosal oedema is so marked that the swelling becomes polypoid \n\nMost sore throats are caused by viruses -including adenovirus and Epstein-Barr virus.\n\nBacteria include Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Corynbacterium diphtheriae.\n\nTonsillitis is a common acute inflammation, historically due to streptococcal infection but, with the introduction of antibiotics, viruses are the initiating infective agents in most cases. Acute phase may progress to (a) acute suppuration (quinsy) or (b) CHRONIC TONSILLITIS\n\nThis pseudomembrane may spread to block the larynx, causing respiratory obstruction.\n\nThe EXOTOXIN of diphtheria is encoded by a bacteriophage (a virus which infects the bacterium). It can cause myocarditis (p.212) and neuropathy (p.569).\n\nIn Acute epiglottitis, typically due to Haemophilus influenzae, there is severe inflammation and oedema. In young children, the larynx becomes obstructed necessitating tracheostomy and administration of antibiotics.\n\nAcute laryngitis is often due to parainfluenza viruses. Acute oedema of the glottis is seen in some cases of anaphylaxis (p.101) and angioneurotic oedema.\n\nMembrane consisting of fibrin, necrotic epithelium, neutrophils and numerous bacteria Basement membrane\n\nDiphtheria, now uncommon in countries where vaccination is widespread, is a serious infection.\n\nThe formation of a pseudomembrane is striking.\n\nDilated crypts containing inspissated exudate -harbouring bacteria and frequently colonies of Actinomyces.\n\nLiability to relapse to acute inflammation.\n\nSwollen, red tonsils with purulent exudate at mouths of crypts.\n\nCigarette smoking, repeated attacks of infection and atmospheric pollution may lead to chronic inflammation of the larynx.\n\nTwo main features are (a) changes in the lining epithelium and (b) increase in mucus secretion.\n\nTuberculosis -this can cause severe ulceration of the larynx and is usually secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis.\n\nThis is found in singers and those who abuse their voice. Small smooth nodules may be seen on one or both vocal cords where the cords impact during phonation.\n\nThey consist of squamous epithelium overlying fibrin-rich and myxoid stroma. \n\nPapillomas may be single but are often multiple and due to infection by papilloma virus. The epithelium may be one of two types:\n\nNasopharyngeal carcinoma is common in Eastern countries and is associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection.\n\nAdenocarcinoma of the nose is a rare tumour, sometimes seen in woodworkers.\n\nTumours of the true cord tend to stay localised and have a better prognosis than supraglottic (X) and subglottic (Y) tumours -the looser surrounding tissues allow early local and cervical node spread.\n\nHaemangiomas, especially of the nasal septum, can cause persistent nose bleeds. A special form, angiofibroma, affects male children and grows throughout childhood but typically regresses.\n\nThese are mainly squamous carcinomas and are commonly seen in the larynx. Intraepithelial neoplasia (carcinoma-in-situ) is a frequent precursor.\n\nSmoking and alcohol consumption are aetiologically important. The rate of growth and spread is influenced by the site within the larynx.\n\nIn transitional papillomas, the abnormal epithelium grows down the glandular ducts and the name 'inverted papilloma' is applied. Such tumours often recur after incomplete removal.\n\nTransitional cell Squamous cell X Y ACINUS This is the functional unit of the lung, where gas transfer takes place. It consists of the respiratory bronchiole and associated alveolar ducts and sacs supplied by one terminal bronchiole. There are approximately 25 000 acini in the normal adult male lung.\n\nThis is served by one preterminal bronchiole and is the smallest anatomic compartment of lung that is grossly apparent. It contains 3 to 30 acini and is bound by connective tissue septa. These connective tissue septa may be accentuated in smokers.\n\nThe total area for air exchange is very large (equivalent to a tennis court) allowing considerable reserve capacity. Three factors are involved in the maintenance of adequate respiration:\n\n1. Adequate intake of air 2. Rapid diffusion along alveolar ducts and through alveolar walls 3. Adequate perfusion of pulmonary circulation Interference with any of these factors will result in respiratory embarrassment (dyspnoea) and even respiratory failure.\n\nThis may be due to lesions and diseases which interfere with the mechanics of respiration, such as central nervous lesions affecting the respiratory centre, paralysis of muscles of respiration as in poliomyelitis, injuries and deformities of the thoracic skeleton (e.g. fracture of ribs, kyphosis) and pleural disease preventing lung expansion as in pleural effusion or pneumothorax.\n\nThe most common cause of hypoventilation is bronchial obstruction. This may be reversible due to bronchial spasm as in asthma or irreversible in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p.258).\n\nThree mechanisms may interfere with diffusion:\n\n1. Reduction in the total alveolar surface available for diffusion, e.g. consolidated airless lobe in pneumonia, fibrosis of lung or tumour growth. 2. Increase in distance over which diffusion takes place as in emphysema.\n\nIn many lung diseases this imbalance is increased. Admixture of well and poorly oxygenated blood results in hypoxaemia.\n\nThe upper area of the lung is better ventilated than perfused Even in the normal lung there is imbalance between ventilation and perfusion 3. Increase in the thickness of the alveolar capillary membrane. Diffusion of gas across the membrane is so rapid this can be of little practical importance. CO 2 is more soluble than O 2 and diffusion through the alveolar wall is 20 times as rapid as O 2 , therefore while blood O 2 progressively falls there is usually no retention of CO 2 .\n\nInterference with the pulmonary circulation may occur in 4 main ways: This is an inflammation of the large and medium bronchi. The condition may be serious if associated with pre-existing respiratory disease. Mucous and serous glands in the walls of the bronchi provide abundant mucoid secretion during the inflammation. Ciliated epithelia lining the bronchi aid passage of the exudate upward and help prevent spread down to the bronchioles.\n\nIn most cases, the process is initiated by a viral or mycoplasmal infection. It is a common complication of influenza and measles. This initial phase is followed by bacterial invasion. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are commonest, but Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes may be found, especially in infants.\n\nThe condition is usually mild, and spread to the bronchioles is unusual in healthy adults due to the effective ciliary action of the bronchial epithelium. Spread may occur however in debilitated people. Bronchiolitis and bronchopneumonia result and can prove fatal. Equally important is the serious effect of repeated attacks of acute infection in patients with CHRONIC BRONCHITIS (p.258).\n\nIn children:\n\n1. Whooping cough (due to Bordetella pertussis) may cause permanent damage due to the severity of the infection and the stress on the airways during the coughing and whooping attacks. 2. Bronchiolitis in the very young (<2 years), in the majority of cases, is due to Respiratory Syncytial Virus and the risk of progression to bronchopneumonia is high. In asthma, there are spasmodic attacks of reversible bronchial obstruction with wheezing and dyspnoea and often a dry cough. The prevalence has markedly increased in recent years, although has now plateaued. There are 2 main patterns:\n\n1. Atopic asthma (p.102) 2. Non-atopic asthma -typically starts in childhood.\n\n-usually in middle age. -often a strong family history of asthma -usually no history of atopy: or atopic conditions (e.g. eczema).\n\nfamily history uncommon. -attacks provoked by predominantly IgE type I -no particular antigens hypersensitivity reaction to inhaled incriminated. allergens, e.g. pollen, cats, house mite dust.\n\nOther varieties include occupational asthma and aspirin-induced asthma. The basic mechanism is as follows: \n\nIn some cases the following may be seen:\n\n1. Curschmann's spiralsappear as small white granules in sputum. The histological changes are a combination of allergic reaction and muscular hypertrophy, the result of prolonged spasm. This term describes three entities that show considerable clinical overlap: 1. Chronic bronchitis 2. Emphysema 3. Small airways disease COPD is common and is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide.\n\nAetiology The main factors are: 1. SMOKING -by far the major risk factor and dose related. 2. \u03b1 1 -antitrypsin deficiency. Reduced levels of this protease inhibitor correlate with lung damage, especially in smokers. 3. OCCUPATION, especially exposure to dusts, e.g. coal mining.\n\nThe clinical definition is based on the presence of a productive cough lasting at least 3 months and occurring annually for at least 2 years.\n\nPathologically the following changes are seen:\n\nThe increase in thickness of the mucous gland layer is striking: at post-mortem the Reid index is measured -i.e. the ratio of the submucous layer (X) to the whole thickness (Y): a value greater than 1:2 is significant.\n\nEPISODES of ACUTE BRONCHITISthese may precipitate respiratory failure and often cause death.\n\nLarge quantity of viscid secretion\n\nThe effect of these changes is: When removed the lung tends to collapse unless it is inflated with fixative and cut later. Special stains show loss of elastic tissue. The capillaries are stretched and thinned. The reduction in blood supply is probably a factor in leading to rupture of alveoli.\n\nThere is little evidence of bronchiolitis. The voluminous lungs produce characteristic radiological changes. The distension eventually spreads to involve the respiratory bronchiole, i.e. the whole acinus is affected -panacinar emphysema.\n\nAlveolar walls thin, ruptured with retracted ends.\n\nIn emphysema alveolar destruction is the result of several processes:\n\n(1) An imbalance between protease and antiprotease activity. This may occur due to: (a) Reduced inhibitor in \u2423 1 -antitrypsin deficiency (inherited in an autosomal codominant pattern.\n\nEMPHYSEMA 261 (b) Excess enzyme production, e.g. due to smoking \u2192 inflammation of bronchioles \u2192 \u2191 proteases \u2192 centrilobular emphysema.\n\n(2) Innate immunity Alterations in Toll like receptor 4 may result in persistent low grade activation of the innate immune system and destruction of lung tissue.\n\n(3) Cellular senescence Cigarette smoke upregulates genes involved cellular senescence and affected cells may undergo apoptosis.\n\nEmphysema is an important component of lung damage due to dust inhalation (pneumoconiosis) (see p.272).\n\nPatients with COPD tend to fall into 2 groups depending on whether or not they tolerate hypoxia.\n\n(a) PINK PUFFERS (b) BLUE BLOATERS Do NOT tolerate hypoxia.\n\nTolerate hypoxia. Severe breathlessness.\n\nSevere hypoxaemia and hypercapnia. Hyperventilation.\n\nRight ventricular hypertrophy. Relatively normal blood gases.\n\nCor Pulmonale with peripheral oedema. Secondary polycythaemia.\n\nEventually many patients develop severe chronic respiratory failure and may die during an acute episode of bronchitis. Bronchopneumonia is primarily an inflammation spreading from terminal bronchioles to their related alveoli. The lesions are initially focal, involving one or more lobules. First red, then grey, they show a central bronchiole containing pus.\n\nAs the name suggests, a complete lobe or even two lobes of a lung are affected, the most striking changes occurring in the alveoli. The disease is now rare in Western countries. It is seen typically in adults aged 20-50 years with males predominating and is caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Occasionally Klebsiella pneumoniae is the agent in the debilitated elderly, diabetics and alcoholics.\n\nThe whole affected lobe progresses uniformly through 4 distinct phases illustrating the classic progression of an acute inflammation: this has been so radically altered by antibiotic treatment that the following description is to some extent historical. \n\nClinically, the onset is acute with fever and often rigors. There is a dry cough and rusty sputum; dyspnoea and often chest pain due to pleurisy.\n\nThe Pathology is described in 4 phases merging sequentially: all the alveoli in the lobe are uniformly affected. Previously confused with pneumococcal pneumonia, Legionnaire's disease occurs in small epidemics, is more common in males and is due to a tiny Gram-negative bacillus -Legionella pneumophila. The death rate can be high -up to 20%. Infection is associated with inhalation of aerosol from contaminated water storage systems.\n\nTwo phases are recognised:\n\nProdromal phase -vague flu-like illness lasting about 5 days.\n\nActive phase A dry cough develops. There is pyrexia and the patient may become seriously unwell with confusion. Signs of consolidation appear. Severe vomiting and diarrhoea may develop.\n\nHyponatraemia. Lymphopenia. Neutrophils normal.\n\nSigns of disseminated intravascular coagulation may develop. The most useful diagnostic tests are to detect the bacteria in sputum or Legionella antigens in urine. Serology may show an increase in antibody titre after 10-15 days.\n\nBoth lungs are consolidated, dark red, heavy and oedematous. Fibrinous pleurisy or pleural effusion may be found.\n\nTwo stages are evident:\n\nThe exudate may organise, causing an increasing interstitial fibrosis with permanent loss of lung function. \n\nIn most cases, influenzal infection is confined to the upper respiratory tract, but in debilitated persons and during epidemics, the whole respiratory tract is affected.\n\nIntense inflammation with haemorrhage develops.\n\nOf the three main types A, B and C, type A is the most virulent, and mutants of this type are responsible for most epidemics and the fatalities which occur. The 2009 pandemic was due to a swine influenza of type A known as H1N1. Severe disease and death was more common in children and pregnant women.\n\nSecondary infection is common, the bacteria most frequently involved being Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome is a recently recognised infectious atypical pneumonia caused by a novel corona virus, the SARS-associated corona virus. The disease was first recognised in Asia in February 2003 and caused a pandemic over the ensuing months. \n\nThe lungs are bulky, purple red and exude blood-stained froth when cut. The microscopic changes vary from one part to another. There are a number of pneumonic conditions due to viruses and bacteria in which a common pattern of pathological change is observed.\n\nVariations in the basic pattern occur in different infections. Confluent consolidation is often found in psittacosis and ornithosis (excreted by infected birds) and in measles giant cell pneumonia. Interstitial pneumonia is produced by cytomegalovirus and in rickettsial infections such as Q fever and 'scrub typhus'. In mycoplasma pneumonia, inflammation spreads from the bronchioles into the lung parenchyma and may become chronic with fibrosis.\n\nOccasionally found:\n\nThe lining epithelial cells of bronchioles and alveoli are stimulated by the presence of the virus.\n\nAlveoli may contain oedema fluid, red cells or fibrin Alveolar walls thickened by mononuclear infiltrate\n\nNecrosis of bronchiolar epithelium Inspissated secretion ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA This is due to inhalation of food or infected material from the mouth or pharynx. It may occur during anaesthesia or coma or may complicate conditions associated with frequent regurgitation, e.g. oesophageal obstruction, pyloric stenosis or poor swallowing due to stroke or motor neurone disease.\n\nIn adult cases the inhalation of acid gastric contents may cause an initial shock reaction: in other cases the onset is insidious.\n\nPossible progression is as follows:\n\nInhalation of Secondary Bronchopneumonia foreign material infection lung abscess\n\nLipid pneumonia -The exogenous form is due to long-continued inhalation of small quantities of oily material usually derived from nasal medicaments: it is often clinically silent. Oily vacuoles are seen in the lung tissue.\n\n-The endogenous form is derived from tissue lipid debris distal to local bronchial obstruction. Foamy macrophages accumulate and the lung tissue is golden yellow in colour.\n\nOpportunistic infections are seen in therapeutically immunosuppressed patients and in AIDS cases.\n\nThe causative agents include:\n\nViruses -e.g. Cytomegalovirus Bacteria -e.g. Mycobacterium avium intracellulare Fungi -e.g. Pneumocystis jiroveci, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans.\n\nHistologically 'foreign material', usually vegetable matter, may be seen evoking a foreign body giant cell reaction.\n\nThis is now an uncommon condition due to prompt treatment of preceding infection. The usual causes are:\n\nRarer causes of abscess are: pyaemia, trauma to lung, extension from suppuration in mediastinum, spinal column or subphrenic region, and infection with Entamoeba histolytica. 1. Inhalation of infected material from the larynx or pharynx.\n\nThe lungs are more commonly affected by TB than any other organ. The incidence of TB in developed countries is rising, partly due to AIDS. Drug resistant strains of Mycobacteria are an increasing problem.\n\nThere are 2 patterns of pulmonary tuberculosis -primary and secondary.\n\nThis occurs in patients, usually children, who have not been previously exposed to TB or vaccinated against it.\n\nInfection is by inhalation. \n\nThis is typically seen in secondary TB, but may also complicate primary infection.\n\nThe infection can spread by several pathways.\n\n(a) Direct spread -e.g. to pleura and pericardium.\n\n(b) By the bronchi.\n\nTubercle bacilli may spread to the larynx or by the bronchi to give tuberculous bronchopneumonia ('Galloping consumption').\n\nConsolidation is seen throughout large areas of lung parenchyma.\n\nThis occurs particularly in the immunosuppressed.\n\nThis may lead to isolated blood borne infection e.g. tuberculous meningitis (p.551), renal TB and bone TB, e.g. Pott's disease of the spine: or to miliary spread throughout the body.\n\n(d) By the pulmonary arteries (probably by lymphatics draining into the inferior vena cava).\n\nIn this, miliary spread occurs throughout the lung fields alone.\n\nThe clinical course of tuberculosis is variable and depends on the immune status of the individual, the response of the bacteria to drugs, and intercurrent disease.\n\nThe histological features are as described on page 72.\n\nMiliary tubercles, approximately 1-2 mm, are seen throughout the lung fields.\n\nThe reaction to inhaled dust varies very considerably. Some dusts, e.g. pure carbon, are inert: others, e.g. silicates, cause severe lung disease.\n\nBasic Pathology 1. Inorganic dust particles reaching the lungs are ingested by alveolar macrophages.\n\nSimple anthracotic changes Irregular masses of black fibrous tissue in the upper lobes with cavities filled with black fluid Chronic inflammation and fibrosis ANTHRACOSIS Pure carbon is biologically inert and is deposited as in (a) above with no ill effects. Damage to the lung seen in coal-miners and in populations exposed to carbon polluted atmosphere is potentiated by the content of silicates and other pollutants. The cause is unknown, theories include tuberculous infection as an initiator dust dose and composition, genetic factors and deviant immune responses.\n\nOrganic dust particles which cause lung disease by a different mechanism include FUNGI encountered in many occupations, e.g. farmers, malt workers, bird fanciers.\n\nThe basic pathology is a Type III hypersensitivity reaction (p. 102) and the term hypersensitivity pneumonitis (Extrinsic allergic alveolitis) is used. The severe diseases caused by inorganic dust inhalation, usually occupationally, are described.\n\n1. Silicosis -stone workers, sandblasters, miners. 2. Asbestosis -shipbuilding, insulation, electrical work.\n\nThe damage caused depends on:\n\n(a) The type of dust e.g. soluble/insoluble.\n\n(b) The shape of the particle, e.g.\n\n(c) The size of the particleparticles longer than 5 \u03bcm are likely to be trapped in the nose and large airways.\n\n(d) The amount of exposurelarge amounts overwhelm the defence mechanisms (especially lung macrophages).\n\nThe lung lesions are slowly progressive over many years. Silicates are particularly damaging to lung macrophages (see p. 272).\n\n273 Fibres align in the long axis of the airways helping them to reach the lung.\n\nPatients develop increasing breathlessness and may die of respiratory failure and cor pulmonale.\n\nThe silicotic lung is particularly susceptible to tuberculosis (which may be due to the effects of silica on pulmonary macrophages). Historically, this was an important cause of death.\n\nNodules may coalesce with progression to diffuse fibrosis Nodule with central necrotic core: concentric layers of fibrosis surrounded by silica dust laden macrophages.\n\nAsbestos is the generic name for a group of fibrous silicates widely used in heavy industry for insulation (particularly in shipbuilding).\n\nThere are two distinct forms of asbestos -serpentine (curly and flexible) and amphibole (straight and stiff). Amphibole fibres (crocidolite and amosite) are more pathogenic than serpentine fibres (principally chrysotile).\n\nAsbestosis results from chronic exposure.\n\nNote: Mesothelioma may also affect the pericardium and peritoneum.\n\nNote: There are usually significantly fewer asbestos fibres/bodies in mesothelioma than in asbestosis.\n\nTumour may also affect parietal pleura\n\nThis can occur up to 40 years after a brief exposure to asbestos (particularly crocidolite).\n\nRarely there is diffuse pleural fibrosis\n\nThese are dense areas of hyaline fibrosis on the parietal pleura.\n\nThey cause no morbidity but are markers of exposure.\n\n(a) Pleural plaques -these are the most common manifestation of asbestos exposure.\n\nOther important complications are:\n\nAsbestos workers have an increased risk of lung cancer, especially if they also smoke. Risk of cancer = risk due to smoking \u00d7 risk due to asbestos.\n\nThe ASBESTOS BODIES are markers of asbestos exposure and can be identified in SPUTUM or lung tissue.\n\nSome asbestos fibres become encrusted with iron and protein often progressing to honeycombing\n\nDiffuse fibrosis is most marked in lower lobes~2 0 \u03bc m\n\nThis encompasses a group of conditions in which the lung is altered by a combination of interstitial inflammation and fibrosis. Several histological patterns are recognised but it is thought that regardless of the type the earliest manifestation is alveolitis and that this accumulation of leucocytes results in release of mediators that can injure parenchymal cells and stimulate fibrosis.\n\nUIP is considered to be the caused by repeated cycles of alveolitis. Healing after each cycle gives rise to fibroblastic proliferation known as fibroblastic foci such that as the disease progresses the fibrosis is a different stages (temporal heterogeneity).\n\nInterstitial inflammation Active fibroblast proliferation (fibroblastic foci)\n\nInfection is a common terminal event, and there is an increased risk of lung cancer. \n\nThis form of fibrosis has a much better prognosis than UIP and is usually steroid responsive. The lung is uniformly affected by interstitial fibrosis and inflammation of variable severity. Fibroblastic foci are abscent and progression to honeycombing is rare. This pattern is commonly seen in association with connective tissue diseases.\n\nThese patterns are both seen almost exclusively in cigarette smokers. In RBILD macrophages accumulate in a patchy distribution around respiratory bronchioles. In DIP there is diffuse distribution of macrophages.\n\n(Bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia). This characterised by a patchy distribution of polypoid plugs of fibroblastic tissue in alveoli, alveolar ducts and sometime bronchioles. A similar pattern may be seen with certain infections, drugs or connective tissue diseases. \n\nThe tumour arises from the main bronchi or their large branches (central) or at the periphery of the lung (peripheral)\n\nMost patients present with cough, haemoptysis or chest pain, but metastases may be the first sign.\n\nThe lung distal to the tumour may collapse or become consolidated (Retention pneumonia). \n\nHaematogenous spread is common, usually due to invasion of pulmonary veins. The common sites are: LIVER, BONE, BRAIN, ADRENAL (the last is usually asymptomatic but is found frequently at autopsy).\n\nLymphatic spread to cervical nodes and retrograde spread to the abdomen occurs.\n\nThese include:\n\nThis is the most aggressive form of lung cancer and metastasises early and widely. It does respond well, at least initially, to cisplatin based chemotherapy -some patients survive for up to 2 years.\n\nThe proportions vary between series.\n\nAlthough squamous carcinoma is often slow growing, there is often extensive destruction of local tissues. The affected bronchi are often blocked, leading to retention pneumonia or collapse.\n\nCells of same type throughout depth of epithelium Squamous metaplasia\n\nThe tumour arises from neuro-endocrine cells and expresses markers such as NCAM-1. It is the form which most commonly has endocrine and other non-metastatic humoral effects.\n\nThese tend to arise centrally from major bronchi, within dysplastic squamous epithelium following squamous metaplasia.\n\nAlmost no cytoplasm.\n\nSpindle-shaped dark nuclei; may appear to be rounded or oval. May be arranged in sheets, cords or small round aggregates.\n\nClusters of hyperchromatic cells with nuclear moulding may be seen on sputum cytology\n\nADENOCARCINOMA This tumour is a common tumour in women and is seen in non-smokers, but is also associated with smoking. At least two-thirds arise in the periphery of the lung, sometimes in relation to scarring. In non-smoking women, particularly of East Asian origin, there is a high incidence of epidermal growth factor receptor mutations that confer responsiveness to certain chemotherapeutic agents.\n\nTwo main patterns are seen:\n\n(a) A well defined mass of malignant (b) Growth of tumour cells along the cells arranged in acini with a alveolar walls (so-called fibrous stroma.\n\n'bronchioalveolar carcinoma').\n\nAs the name suggests, this tumour consists of large malignant cells without any specific differentiation. This is therefore a diagnosis of exclusion. The tumour usually arises centrally.\n\nThe main factors are:\n\n1. Cigarette smoking -This is by far the major cause, established by epidemiological and animal studies. Cigarette smoke contains carcinogens such as 3,4 benzpyrene and nitrosamines. Passive smoking is also significant.\n\n2. Industrial and atmospheric pollution -There is a large number of pollutant industrial processes e.g. asbestos workers, miners exposed to irradiation (e.g. radon, uranium) and metal smelters (e.g. chromium and nickel).\n\nLung cancer is more common in urban than in rural areas.\n\nIt must always be remembered that many other cancers spread to the lungs both by blood and lymphatic routes.\n\nTumour cells spreading along alveolar walls\n\nBenign tumours of the bronchi and lung are unusual. There are 2 main types.\n\nPapillomas are similar to the papillary tumours of the larynx. They occur in young people and on occasion may cause stridor due to partial bronchial obstruction. They are due to papilloma virus infection (types 6 and 11). Malignant change is exceptional.\n\nThese are uncommon lesions of the lung which consist of lobules of cartilage and cleft-like spaces lined by bronchial epithelium. Their importance is that they appear as 'coin lesions' on chest X-ray and may simulate primary or secondary tumours. Current evidence suggests they are benign neoplasms rather than hamartomas.\n\nThese tumours account for 1-2% of primary lung neoplasms. They often appear around the age of 50 years. Usually the tumour is situated in a primary bronchus or at the lung periphery. The tumour is a smooth surfaced yellow nodule.\n\nHistologically these resemble carcinoid tumours of the appendix (see p.334). A small proportion of these tumours metastasise to regional lymph nodes -all are potentially malignant.\n\nCentral tumours tend to block the bronchus in which they arise.\n\nCollapse of lung Pneumonia Infection Bronchiectasis Lung abscess\n\nAtypical carcinoid tumours: This sub-group of tumours shows nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic activity and necrosis. Over half eventually metastasise.\n\nBoth benign and low grade malignant tumours of the bronchial glands are occasionally seen and show histological similarity to salivary gland tumours. These may present as obstructing lesions.\n\nPolypoid tumours, usually multiple, at mouths of large bronchi\n\nThere are several causes.\n\n(a) Infection -usually due to spread from pneumonia or tuberculosis.\n\n-following penetrating injury, e.g. stab wound. (b) Autoimmunity -e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus. (c) Overlying a pulmonary infarct (p.162).\n\nExamination of the pleural fluid may show mesothelial cells, lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils and sometimes tumour cells.\n\nThe accumulation of fluid within the pleura can be explained as a form of local oedema.\n\nThe composition of the fluid is related to the underlying cause.\n\nTRANSUDATE EXUDATE e.g. in heart failure e.g. in fibrinous pleurisy -low protein content; -high protein content; -few inflammatory cells.\n\n-numerous inflammatory cells. If infection of the pleura proceeds, an empyema (a collection of pus in the pleura) may form. This is now unusual.\n\nPleural friction rub, pleuritic chest pain due to movement on respiration\n\nThe exudate is absorbed but organisation may lead to pleural adhesions.\n\nThis is the accumulation of air in the pleural space. It may follow blunt trauma or penetrating wound, e.g. stabbing. Older patients with emphysema may develop spontaneous pneumothorax. In young people this is usually due to rupture of small bullae or excessive smoking of cannabis.\n\nIn a TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX there is a valve effect -air continues to enter the pleura during inspiration but cannot exit during expiration. There is often a malignant pleural effusion.\n\nHistologically, the tumour consists of either epithelial or sarcomatous tissues, or may be mixed (biphasic)\n\nPatients complain of chest pain and breathlessness.\n\nMetastatic tumours affect the pleura in 2 ways.\n\n(a) By LYMPHATIC spread -with numerous small nodules, e.g. breast carcinoma.\n\n(b) By DIRECT spread, e.g. lung cancer.\n\nThere is usually a pleural effusion in which tumour cells can be found.\n\nThis primary pleural malignancy is usually due to asbestos exposure -often many years before.\n\nThe tumour may encase the entire lung and grow into the interlobar fissures\n\nThe tumour can metastasise to other sites, but most patients die due to the local respiratory effects."}
