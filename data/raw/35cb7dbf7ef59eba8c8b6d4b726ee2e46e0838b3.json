{"title": "Bordetella Pertussis is an Uncommon Pathogen in Children Hospitalized with Bronchiolitis During the Winter Season", "body": "There are conflicting data on the prevalence of B. pertussis in infants presenting with bronchiolitis ranging from that of an uncommon pathogen (< 1%) to that of a common pathogen (8 to 16%) (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . The typical presentation of pertussis is quite distinct from that of bronchiolitis (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . However, for both pertussis and bronchiolitis most of the severe illness occurs in young infants, both can present as apnea, and pertussis can manifest atypically in partially or fully vaccinated children. Also, the epidemiology of pertussis and bronchiolitis is distinct with pertussis causing cyclical epidemics every 2 to 5 years with increasing incidence in recent years and bronchiolitis epidemics occur annually during the fall and winter months. Complicating these distinctions is viral co-infection with RSV or other respiratory viruses frequently detected in infants with B. pertussis infection (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . We recently conducted a prospective, multicenter study of 2207 children hospitalized for bronchiolitis during three consecutive winter seasons (2007 to 2010) in the United States (US) (14) . An objective of the study was to identify the putative respiratory pathogens in children hospitalized with bronchiolitis. In this report we describe the prevalence of B. pertussis infection in children hospitalized with bronchiolitis from November through March and describe their clinical presentation and hospital course.\n\nA prospective, multicenter cohort study was conducted for 3 consecutive years during the 2007 to 2010 winter seasons, as part of the Multicenter Airway Research Collaboration (MARC), a program of the Emergency Medicine Network (EMNet) (www.emnet-usa.org) (14, 15) . The number of participating sites varied over the 3 years: 13 sites in year 1; 16 sites in year 2; and 14 sites in year 3. Each month from November 1 until March 31, site investigators across 12 U.S. states used a standardized protocol to enroll a target number of consecutive patients per month from the inpatient wards and the intensive care unit (ICU) with an aim to enroll 20% of the cohort from intensive care units (ICU).\n\nAll patients were treated at the discretion of the treating physician. Inclusion criteria were an attending physician's diagnosis of bronchiolitis, age <2 years, and the ability of the parent/ guardian to give informed consent. Patients were enrolled within 18 hours of admission. The exclusion criteria were previous enrollment or transfer to a participating hospital >48 hours after the original admission time. The institutional review board at all participating hospitals approved the study.\n\nA structured interview was conducted with the children's caretakers to assess patients' demographic characteristics, medical and environmental history, duration of symptoms, and details of the acute illness. In addition, caretakers were asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) pertussis classification questions to identify a clinical case of probable pertussis (16, 17) . Medical records were reviewed to obtain clinical data from the pre-admission evaluation (clinic or emergency department) and the child's inpatient course and disposition. Information on immunization was based on parental history and was not confirmed by medical record or immunization registry. The adult acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) immunization status was not collected on the parents or legal guardians.\n\nNasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were performed and processed using a standardized protocol. All of the sites collected 98% of the samples within 24 hours of a child's hospital admission. After collection, the NPA samples were stored locally at \u221280\u00b0C and subsequently batch shipped on dry ice to the central laboratory at Baylor College of Medicine, where they were stored at \u221280\u00b0C for later testing.\n\nAll PCR assays were conducted as singleplex or duplex two-step real time PCR (rtPCR). Details of the primers and probes for the detection of the common respiratory viruses (RSV A and B, rhinovirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3, enterovirus, human metapneumovirus A and B, coronavirus -OC43, -229E, -NL63 and -HKU1, and adenoviruses) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae have been described elsewhere (18) (19) (20) . For B. pertussis the insertion sequence IS481 was targeted. IS481 sequence is unique to B. pertussis and B. holmesii (19) . The genome of B. pertussis contains 80 to 100 copies of IS481 while the genome of B. holmesii contains 8 to 10 copies. The rtPCR for B. pertussis was shown to be specific for B. pertussis and did not identify B. bronchiseptica (ATCC # 4671 \u2122 , ATCC Manassas, Virginia) or B. parapertussis (ATCC # 15311 \u2122 ) which can cause a pertussis like syndrome. All rtPCR assays were tested in duplicate and samples with incongruent values (one well positive) were retested. To reduce carryover contamination, sample preparation, RNA/DNA extraction, cDNA and amplification were performed in separate areas. All PCR runs had extraction and reagent positive and negative controls.\n\nAll analyses were performed using Stata 11.2 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX). Data are presented as proportions with 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) and medians with interquartile ranges (IQR). Unadjusted analyses were performed using chi-square or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. All P-values were two-tailed, with P<0.05 considered statistically significant.\n\nOne or more respiratory pathogens were identified in 2068 (94%) of 2207 enrolled children admitted for bronchiolitis. Demographic characteristics, ICU disposition and major respiratory pathogens by age groups are presented in Table 1 . Overall, the median age was 4 months (IQR, 2-9 months); 59% were male; 61% were white; and 18% required ICU care. One or more respiratory pathogen was detected in 93.7% of cases. The two most common pathogens detected were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (RV) which were found in 72% and 26% of all children, respectively. Co-infections with one or more respiratory pathogens occurred in 30% of children. B. pertussis was identified in only four cases (0.2%; 95% CI, 0.1-0.5%).\n\nThe four children infected with B. pertussis were all less than 6 months of age. Therefore, the subsequent analysis is restricted to the 1,405 (64%) infants less than 6 months of age. Of those age <6 months, the median age was 2 months (IQR, 1-4 months). The other demographic characteristics were similar to the overall cohort: 58% male; 63% white; 19% requiring ICU care, 78% with RSV, 23% with RV and 26% with co-infection. Applying the CDC clinical case definition for probable pertussis, 52 (3.7%) children were classified as having \"probable\" pertussis of which 2 were confirmed to have B. pertussis by rtPCR. Two other infants with laboratory confirmed B. pertussis did not meet the CDC clinical case definition for probable pertussis ( Table 2 ). These 4 infants are grouped together in Table 2 as \"B. pertussis confirmed\". A second respiratory pathogen was identified in three of the infants with B. pertussis; two had a RV co-infection and 1 child had coronavirus HKU1.\n\nThe clinical characteristics of the 4 infants with B. pertussis confirmed by PCR were compared to the 50 infants less than 6 months who met the CDC clinical case definition of probable pertussis but were PCR-negative for B. pertussis and to the 1351 infants less than 6 months who did not meet the CDC clinical case definition of probable pertussis and were negative for B. pertussis (Table 3) . A history of cough greater than 2 weeks was obtained in 52 (3.9%) of the 1351 infants who did not have probable or confirmed pertussis. These 52 infants did not meet the CDC clinical case definition of probable pertussis because they did not have a history of paroxysms of coughing, inspiratory whoop or post-tussive emesis. By clinical history, infants with confirmed B. pertussis had similar characteristics to the infants who met the CDC clinical case definition of probable pertussis. Most of the infants from both of these groups had 3 or more days of difficulty breathing at the time of hospitalization. The clinical findings on admission were similar between the three groups. However, infants with B. pertussis had median white blood cell (WBC) count that was twice as high and their median duration of hospitalization was longer than infants in the other two groups.\n\nIn recent years there has been an increasing incidence of reported pertussis, with the highest incidence in infants (16, 21, 22) . Bronchiolitis is the most common cause of hospitalization in infants and is generally attributed to common respiratory viruses (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) . There is a strong interest in defining the role of B. pertussis in children with bronchiolitis in the current era because in both diseases the incidence is highest in infants, they cause life-threatening illness, symptoms can be atypical in young infants and have overlapping features in older infants, there are conflicting data on the prevalence of B. pertussis in bronchiolitis, and molecular diagnostics have improved the detection of B. pertussis. In the current study, we used modern molecular diagnostic methods to demonstrate that B. pertussis is an uncommon pathogen in bronchiolitis. The study population consisted of 2207 U.S. children hospitalized with bronchiolitis during three sequential respiratory seasons from 2007/2008 to 2009/2010. In each of the study years, there were 13 to 16 sites from 12 states participating from across the U.S. B. pertussis was identified in only four children (0.2%; 95% CI, 0.1-0.5%) and all occurred in infants less than 6 months of age. In three of the infants with B. pertussis, a viral co-pathogen was also detected.\n\nThe low prevalence of B. pertussis detected in our study is consistent with data reported in recent years (1-3). Siberry and colleagues identified 1case (0.6%) among 166 children less than 6 years of age hospitalized with respiratory symptoms during the 2000-01 RSV season in Baltimore (1) Another possibility for our finding is that during the study years (2007-08, 2008-09 and 2009-10), two major pertussis epidemics bracketed but did not encompass our study (28) . from approximately 10% to 68% during the study period while pertussis vaccine coverage in children 19 to 35 months remained steady at 84% increasing to 95% in 2010. Thus our study suggests that during the interepidemic periods, pertussis appears to be an uncommon pathogen in severe bronchiolitis, however during pertussis epidemics our finding might not apply.\n\nIn 2012, approximately 4500 cases of B. pertussis were reported in infants less than 1 year old in the United States with an incidence of 1.13 cases per 1000 children (22) . Bronchiolitis, however, is a common clinical entity in children less than 12 months of age and a common cause of hospitalization. Approximately 80% of bronchiolitis-associated hospitalization occurs in children less than 12 months with an annual hospitalization rate in 2009 of approximately 25 per 1000 person year or an average of 105,000 hospitalizations (27) . In 2002 there was an estimated 149,000 bronchiolitis-associated hospitalizations in children less than 2 years in the United States (29) . In more recent years there has been a trend for decrease in bronchiolitis hospitalization but with an increase in children with co-morbid medical conditions (27) . Children younger than 6 months are particularly vulnerable to severe bronchiolitis, with approximately 57% of all bronchiolitis-associated hospitalization occurring in this group or an annual average of 84,900 hospitalizations. Extrapolating from our study of 4 cases of B. pertussis in 1405 bronchiolitis-associated hospitalization among infants less than 6 months, we would predict approximately 240 cases of B. pertussis occur each respiratory season among U.S. infants less than 6 months who are hospitalized for bronchiolitis. This population is vulnerable to the most severe consequences of pertussis including apnea, pneumonia, encephalopathy and death (12, 22) .\n\nIn children, B. pertussis is classically characterized by prolonged cough with a history of paroxysms of coughing, inspiratory whoop or post-tussive emesis. The CDC developed a clinical case definition to increase the likelihood of detecting pertussis, in particular, in situations when testing is not performed or laboratory tests are negative (16, 17) . In endemic or sporadic cases, like those observed in our study, the clinical case definition of pertussis is met when a child has a history of a coughing illness at least 2 weeks in duration with paroxysms of coughing, inspiratory whoop or post-tussive emesis without other apparent cause. In our study, 52 children met the CDC clinical case definition of pertussis but only two had laboratory confirmation. Two other children in our study who did not meet the CDC clinical case definition of pertussis had laboratory confirmation. This is consistent with the observation that young infants with B. pertussis can present with atypical symptoms including apnea, cyanosis and wheezing (9, 12, 16) . Of note, three of the 4 children with laboratory confirmed pertussis had a viral co-infection. The viral infection can be considered to constitute an apparent cause other than pertussis in infants who meet the clinical case definition of pertussis and thus has the potential to deter further diagnostic evaluation.\n\nLaboratory confirmation of pertussis can be difficult depending on when persons are tested in the course of their disease and the type of laboratory method used. Leukocytosis early in the illness is characteristic of pertussis but occurs in the minority and is not specific for pertussis (9, 11, 30) . The four infants with pertussis in our study presented with leukocytosis, with the WBC in all four being greater than 19,000 per microliter. PCR is considered the preferred test for confirmation of pertussis because of its increased sensitivity compared with other tests (11, 16) . Not all PCR tests are created equally and some assays can give false positive results because of the region the primers target. For this study we used real time PCR with primers that target the insertion sequence IS481. B. pertussis and B. holmesii are the main species that contain IS481 with nearly 10 times as many copies found in the genome of B. pertussis compared with B. holmesii (19) . A low percentage of B. bronchiseptica strains are also known to contain the IS481 gene. B. holmesii has been recovered in children with pertussis like syndrome (31) . A large cohort study in Europe was conducted to determine if B. holmesii confounds PCR assays that target IS481 and IS1001 (32) . Among 11,319 persons with pertussis like syndrome who were evaluated, 1581 (14%) persons were confirmed to have pertussis based on positive PCR tests. None of these persons were positive for B. holmesii using a species-specific real time PCR test that was based on the recA gene. All together the data suggest that B. holmesii is infrequently detected in persons confirmed to have pertussis based on PCR test that targets IS481.\n\nOur study has some potential limitations. The sites involved are representative of academic hospitals and not community hospitals, and we oversampled for children admitted to the intensive care unit. Both of these factors might affect the prevalence of B. pertussis in children with bronchiolitis-associated hospitalization. Another possible limitation is that B. pertussis was confirmed with a single real time PCR test. A second PCR test is often used to exclude other Bordetella species. It is possible that one or more of these cases might have been due to B. holmesii. Lastly our study was restricted to the months of November through March of each study year. Although most cases of bronchiolitis occur from November through March, the prevalence of pertussis was not determined in those cases that occurred outside the study period.\n\nIn summary, B. pertussis is an uncommon pathogen in children hospitalized with bronchiolitis during the winter season and during interepidemic periods of pertussis. The clinical findings of pertussis in partially vaccinated infants can be atypical, may not meet the CDC definition of probable infection, and co-infection with a respiratory virus can add an additional challenge in making a diagnosis of pertussis. In children hospitalized with bronchiolitis, B. pertussis should be considered in young infants who are slow to improve with conservative management and have an elevated WBC. Making an accurate diagnosis in young infants is important because they are vulnerable to the most severe consequences of pertussis and account for the majority of pertussis deaths. "}
