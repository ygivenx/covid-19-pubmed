On January 12, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially named it the \"2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)\". On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in China to be a \"public health emergency of international concern\". On February 11, 2020, the WHO announced the official name of the disease caused by 2019-nCoV: ( Corona Virus Disease 2019, . In addition, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) announced the official classification of 2019-nCoV as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1] [2] [3] [4] . By 0:00 on February 17, 2020, COVID-19 had spread to all provinces and cities in China and more than 20 foreign countries, with 68,595 confirmed cases, 8,228 suspected cases, 9,755 cured cases and 1,667 deaths in China and cases among children continuing to rise [5] . Epidemiological investigations have shown that the population is generally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, and the elderly and patients with underlying diseases become more seriously ill after being infected, with a poor prognosis and high mortality [6] .

CKD has a high incidence worldwide and has become one of the major public health problems affecting children.\n\nAt present, the treatment of children with stage II CKD mainly involves the treatment of the primary disease. After Stage II (when the glomerular filtration rate falls below 90 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ), long-term comprehensive management is carried out, and efforts are made to detect the causes, remove or reduce the damage factors, delay the progressive damage of renal function and actively treat and reduce complications before the disease develops to Stage V [11] [12] . The treatment of children with stage V CKD mainly involves renal replacement therapies (including kidney transplantation, maintenance blood purification and peritoneal dialysis) and symptomatic treatment of complications [11] [12] . Therefore, all children with CKD need to travel between home and the hospital at different frequencies and have a high requirement for the continuity of medical treatment.\n\nIn the context of the public health emergency of international concern of the COVID-19 outbreak, the management and medical treatment of children with CKD and the mental status of their parents will certainly be affected. To prevent and control SARS-CoV-2 infection, continue the long-term standard management of children with CKD, better serve children with CKD and avoid the spread of the epidemic, we conducted an anonymous online questionnaire survey in collaboration with the 12 largest pediatric nephropathy diagnosis and treatment centers in China. Through the survey, we sought to understand the effect of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak on the medical treatment of various kinds of Chinese children with CKD, changes in approaches to their medical treatment, their greatest needs at present and changes in .

The 17 centers are located in such regions as northeastern China, eastern China, southern China, central China, western China and northwestern China, and each of them is the largest pediatric nephropathy diagnosis and treatment center in the province or municipality. All CKD diagnoses met the KIDGO diagnostic criteria [11] .\n\nAll the patients recruited, screened, and included were inpatients registered at various diagnostic and treatment centers. Questionnaires were sent to the parents of a total of 754 patients with definitive diagnoses via QR codes on WeChat, and 735 valid questionnaires were collected.\n\nThis online questionnaire had three parts: the first part collected the basic information of the sick children and their parents (age, gender, diagnosis (CKD stage), address, family economic status, disease duration, attention paid by the parents to the epidemic); the second part assessed the impact of the epidemic on the medical treatment of the patients and their needs for medical treatment (the hospital that they visit, transportation mode, the effect of the epidemic on regular medical treatment, delays in medical treatment, the self-perceived effect of the epidemic on the condition of the sick child, measures that the parents hoped could be taken if they could not see a doctor, help that the parents hoped to get during the epidemic); the third part evaluated the impact of the epidemic on the mental status and anxiety of the parents (mentality of the parents and the attention paid to the COVID-19 outbreak, self-perceived probability of the child being infected by SARS-CoV-2, concern of the .

The parents of 735 sick children participated in the survey, of whom 447 were boys (60.8%) and 288 were girls (39.2%). The age distribution was as follows: 63 patients were younger than 3 years old (8.6%), 160 were between 3 and 6 years old (21.8%), 277 were between 6 and 11 years old (37.7%), and 235 were older than 11 years (31.97%) ( Fig. 1. B) . The distribution of the time since receiving a definitive diagnosis of CKD was as follows: 83 patients had been diagnosed for fewer than 3 months (11.3%), 64 for 3 to 6 months (8.71%), 89 for 6 to 12 months (12.1%), 310 for 1 to 3 years (42.18%) and 189 for more than 3 years (25.7%). Among them, 659 patients had stage I-II CKD (89.6%), 51 had stage III-IV CKD (6.9%), and 25 had stage V CKD and were currently receiving regular blood purification or peritoneal dialysis (3.4%).\n\nA total of 259 patients (35.2%) lived in rural areas, 99 (13.5) lived in the suburbs and 377 (51.3%) lived in cities. Further investigations revealed that most of those living in cities lived in county-level cities, 235 of whom (62.3%) needed to travel for two hours or more to see a doctor, a lengthy trip (Fig. 1. A) .\n\nIn terms of parental education level, 345 (46.9%) had a junior high school or lower education, 276 (37.6%) had a senior high school or vocational college education, and 114 (15.5%) had an undergraduate or postgraduate education. In terms of family income, 300 (40.8%) had an annual income of less than $5000, 241 (32.8%)\n\n.

C) . .\n\nAmong the parents of the 735 sick children, the parents of 555 patients (75.5%) said that the COVID-19 outbreak had a significant impact on the regular medical treatment of their children: 264 (47.6%) said that it would be delayed by 2 to 4 weeks, 199 (35.9%) said that it would be delayed by 4 to 8 weeks, and 92 (16.6%) even said that it would be delayed by more than 8 weeks. A total of 180 parents (24.5%) said that the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the regular medical treatment of their sick child was not significant. Due to reasons such as road control and traffic conditions, 429 parents had difficulties visiting hospitals. Three hundred fifty-two parents (82.1%) said that failing to see the doctor would have an impact on the condition and treatment of their child, and 193 (42.1%) thought that it would have a significant impact (Fig. 2) .\n\nBecause of the COVID-19 epidemic, 84.5% of the parents hoped to get in touch with their nephrologists through online or telephone consultation to discuss the kidney disease and the COVID-19 epidemic; 72.1% of the parents hoped that hospitals could deliver the medication, i.e., with an electronic prescription from the doctor.\n\nEighty-one percent of those hoping the medicines could be delivered were from rural areas or were patients from other provinces (Fig. 2) .\n\nAmong the parents of the 735 sick children, 479 (65.2%) paid attention to the epidemic, spending 30 minutes to 1 hour each day following news of the epidemic and learning relevant medical knowledge.

A total of 496 parents (67.5%) were more anxious than the general population, worrying about aggravation of the original kidney disease or infection with SARS-CoV-2. In terms of anxiety, 458 parents (62.3%) were worried that the CKD might relapse or be aggravated during the epidemic since they could not regularly see the doctor; 203 parents (27.6%) were concerned about being infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the epidemic. A total of 313 parents (42.5%) hoped to receive psychological counselling, and 409 parents (75.5%) said that there were no channels for them to receive psychological counselling (Fig. 3 ).\n\nOn January 21, 2020, the National Health Commission of China decided to include COVID-19 pneumonia as a national \"class B\" infectious disease and manage it as a \"class A\" infectious disease [5, 7] . In the context of this public health emergency of international concern, many problems in the management of Chinese children with CKD have been exposed, and we sought to explore solutions to these issues.\n\nIn our survey, we found that 48.7% of the patients lived in remote rural areas or suburbs, making it inconvenient for them to see a doctor. Although 51.3% lived in cities, most of them lived in county-level cities and needed to travel to provincial capitals or municipalities directly under the central government for medical treatment.\n\nDespite the inconvenience of medical treatment, only 14.2% of the patients would choose to receive medical treatment, reexaminations and follow-up visits in district or county-level hospitals, and the other 85.8% preferred to have reexaminations and follow-up visits in grade-A class-3 hospitals and large specialized hospitals.\n\nAccording to the opinion of the parents, due to the lack of pediatric nephropathy .

As a result, some common kidney diseases cannot be addressed in local hospitals. A complete three-level system for the specialized diagnosis and treatment of children with CKD should be established.\n\nIn our survey, we found that although 81.1% of the parents were paying attention to the COVID-19 epidemic and the situation of the CKD itself, only 4.32% planned to adjust the medication dosage based on their previous medical knowledge and experience. In fact, 1.12% of the parents said they would directly stop the medicines or end the treatment, and 84.5% said that they would rely more on the guidance of doctors, which indicates the low participation of children with CKD and their families.\n\nIn the absence or interruption of the guidance of medical teams, disruptions may occur in the management of the disease. Similarly, we found in our survey that in the face of this serious epidemic, 76.7% of the parents of children with CKD showed a lack of prevention and infection control knowledge, as well as knowledge of channels for nutrition guidance and emergency coping and appeal making; 72.1% of the parents said that they lacked access to medical treatment and medication, suggesting that in major public health emergencies, the Chinese medical service system should give full play to the unique advantages of online hospitals and online diagnosis and treatment, encourage online follow-up consultation for some common diseases and chronic diseases, and reduce the risk of cross-infection among patients in offline treatment. Doctors can carry out online consultations and provide electronic prescriptions, and the patients can then pay the fee for the consultation and medication online. Payment can then be verified by doctors and pharmacists online, and after successful payment, the orders can be taken via electronic prescriptions at pharmacies.\n\nIn the future, online hospitals should also improve their emergency prescription-taking measures. For example, during major epidemics, cooperation and contact with logistics enterprises can be strengthened to deliver medication to the .

Among them, 42.5% of the parents expressed that they hoped to receive psychological counselling, but the access of children with CKD and their parents to counselling was blocked, leaving them isolated and helpless and resulting in psychological anxiety, helplessness and even panic. Therefore, in the context of a public health emergency of international concern, the psychological status of children with CKD and their family members should first be determined to identify high-risk groups and avoid such extreme events as suicide and impulsiveness. Therefore, psychological services and interventions for the mental health of children with CKD and their families at early stages are needed. For example, during this COVID-19 outbreak, it is necessary to provide children with CKD and their family members with psychological support and psychological counselling, thus preventing and reducing frustration caused by the epidemic and preventing extreme events caused by mental stress. To this end, a hotline for psychological guidance can be set up, and guidelines for this hotline should be formulated to effectively alleviate the tension and panic of the public.\n\nDuring this COVID-19 outbreak, many problems in the management of Chinese children with CKD have been exposed, indicating the need to establish a regional contingency plan for CKD management in the context of major public health emergencies. Considering the characteristics of CKD as a chronic disease, a three-level diagnosis and treatment system for children with chronic diseases such as CKD should be established to give full play to graded diagnosis and bidirectional transfer. To gradually improve the care system for children with chronic diseases such as CKD, it is necessary to improve the service function and operation mechanism of \"internet+ CKD health management\", including health assessment of children with .
