{"title": "A conserved region of nonstructural protein 1 from alphacoronaviruses\ninhibits host gene expression and is critical for viral\nvirulence", "body": "Coronaviruses (CoVs)2 belong to a\nlarge family of enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses that are serious threats to\npublic health and have caused considerable damage (1\u20135). Depending on serotype, CoVs can be generally\ndivided into Alpha-, Beta-,\nGamma-, and Deltacoronavirus (\u03b1-CoV,\n\u03b2-CoV, \u03b3-CoV, and \u03b4-CoV, respectively) genera (2). The \u03b1-CoVs include transmissible\ngastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), human\ncoronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), and feline\ninfectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) (1). The\n\u03b2-CoVs include murine hepatitis virus (MHV), SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV (1).\n\nCoV nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) is the N-terminal component of the pp1a\npolyprotein. Only \u03b1-CoVs and \u03b2-CoVs encode nsp1, whereas \u03b3-CoVs\nand \u03b4-CoVs lack this protein (6). Nsp1\nsequences identified using standard search tools, such as BLAST, are divergent among\ndifferent CoVs. The sizes of \u03b1-CoV nsp1 and \u03b2-CoV nsp1 differ; the\n\u03b1-CoVs encode nsp1 proteins of \u223c9 kDa, which are substantially smaller\nthan the \u223c20-kDa nsp1 proteins of \u03b2-CoVs. Although the sequence\nhomologies among TGEV, PEDV, and SARS-CoV nsp1 proteins are low, the core structures\nshare a relatively conserved domain (7\u20139). This high structural similarity may explain why CoV nsp1 has the\nconserved biological function of inhibiting host gene expression. However, the\ncritical region of \u03b2-CoV nsp1 required to inhibit protein synthesis is\ndifferent from that of \u03b1-CoV nsp1 (9\u201312). This difference could imply that the\ndetailed mechanisms through which CoV nsp1 proteins inhibit host gene expression are\nunpredictable. To date, the ability of \u03b2-CoV nsp1 to inhibit host gene\nexpression has been deeply studied. SARS-CoV nsp1 not only prevents mRNA translation\nbut also promotes its degradation by binding to the 40S ribosomal subunit (13). Furthermore, MERS-CoV nsp1 selectively\ntargets mRNA synthesized in the host cell nucleus for degradation and thus inhibits\ntranslation in host cells (14). TGEV and PEDV\nnsp1 proteins cannot bind the 40S ribosomal subunit to inhibit the translation of\nhost mRNA; however, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 nsp1 proteins might bind the 40S\nribosomal subunit to affect host mRNA stability (9, 15, 16).\n\nAt present, the specific pathway by which \u03b1-CoV nsp1 inhibits host gene\nexpression is unknown. However, the function of CoV nsp1 in viral immune system\nevasion has been well-characterized in cell culture. For example, SARS-CoV nsp1\nsuppresses interferon (IFN) expression and host antiviral signaling pathways in\ninfected cells (10, 17). Furthermore, MHV nsp1 efficiently interferes with the type\nI IFN system (11), whereas PEDV nsp1 mediates\ncAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) and NF-\u03baB\ndegradation to inhibit type II IFN responses (12, 18). Thus, nsp1 is considered\na possible major virulence factor for CoVs. Moreover, the contribution of nsp1 to\nCoV pathogenesis has been directly demonstrated for MHV and SARS-CoV (11, 17).\nHowever, little direct evidence has indicated that \u03b1-CoV nsp1 is a virulence\nfactor. Here, we present the crystal structure of full-length TGEV nsp1. Further\nstructural and biochemical analyses indicated that a motif (amino acids\n91\u201395) is important for the inhibition of host gene expression by \u03b1-CoV\nnsp1. In addition, we demonstrate that the loss of nsp1-induced inhibition of host\nprotein synthesis does not affect the replication of TGEV but can significantly\nreduce its virulence in piglets. This research improves our understanding of why\n\u03b1-CoV nsp1 is necessary for virulence and may aid in the development of a new\nattenuated vaccine.\n\nUsing Renilla luciferase (Rluc) assays, we assessed several\nrepresentative \u03b1-CoV nsp1 proteins for their ability to interfere with\nhost-cell gene expression. Human embryonic kidney (HEK-293T) cells were\ncotransfected with plasmids expressing the nsp1 protein and pRL-SV40 plasmids\nexpressing SV40 promoter\u2013driven Rluc. The results showed that TGEV, FIPV,\nHCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and PEDV nsp1 significantly reduced luciferase reporter\ngene expression. Furthermore, subsequent Western blot analysis using equal\namounts of intracellular proteins confirmed this finding (Fig. 1A).\n\nThen, we used TGEV nsp1 as a model to study the detailed function of \u03b1-CoV\nnsp1. Using the SARS-CoV nsp1 protein as a positive control (13), we examined Rluc mRNA in HEK-293T\ncells using real-time quantitative PCR and found that TGEV nsp1 inhibited Rluc\nmRNA synthesis at different time points (Fig.\n1B). To further explore whether TGEV nsp1 could\nbroadly inhibit gene expression in HEK-293T cells, we examined host proteins\nusing a ribopuromycylation assay. The broad-spectrum inhibitory activity of TGEV\nnsp1 on host protein synthesis depended on both concentration and time (Fig. 1, C and\nD).\n\nAlthough the structure of a truncated TGEV nsp1 protein (Protein Data Bank (PDB)\ncode 3ZBD) has been reported (8), we wondered whether the C terminus could affect the\noverall structure. We performed initial crystallization trials for the\nfull-length TGEV nsp1 (residues Met-1 to Arg-109). Fortunately, we were able to\ndetermine the crystal structure of full-length TGEV nsp1 using the molecular\nreplacement method and refined it to 1.85-\u212b resolution in space group\nP21. The details of the phasing and refinement steps are given in\nTable 1. Although the crystal\nresolution was very high, the specific conformation of the C terminus remained\nunclear. This was probably because the C-terminal loop was flexible, for which\nit is difficult to obtain accurate information. Structural characterization\ndemonstrated that the structure of full-length TGEV nsp1 displayed eight\n\u03b2-sheets and two \u03b1-helices (Fig.\n2A), and the full-length protein shared a common\nskeleton with the truncated protein. The similarity of the three-dimensional\nconformations indicated that the C terminus had little influence on the overall\nTGEV nsp1 structure.\n\nTo identify which region in TGEV nsp1 was essential for its inhibitory activity,\nwe used methods that have been previously used to study important functional\nregions in PEDV nsp1 (9). Based on the\ncrystal structure of TGEV nsp1, we designed the following series of plasmids in\nwhich random coils were replaced with flexible Ser-Gly-Ser-Gly (sg) linkers:\nnsp1(1\u20133sg), nsp1(11\u201315sg), nsp1(19\u201322sg),\nnsp1(37\u201340sg), nsp1(46\u201348sg), nsp1(52\u201360sg),\nnsp1(66\u201369sg), nsp1(76\u201384sg), nsp1(91\u201395sg), and\nnsp1(105\u2013109sg) (Fig. 2,\nB and C). The Rluc assay showed that the\nloops comprising amino acids 37\u201340 and 91\u201395 were the most\nimportant regions for the ability of TGEV nsp1 to inhibit reporter gene\nexpression (Fig. 2C).\nSubsequently, Western blot analysis indicated that nsp1(91\u201395sg)\nexpression was significantly higher than nsp1 expression (Fig. 2C), again demonstrating that nsp1\ncould inhibit its own expression (9, 15). We examined Rluc mRNA expression in\nHEK-293T cells by real-time quantitative PCR and found that TGEV\nnsp1(91\u201395sg) and TGEV nsp1(37\u201340sg) did not inhibit Rluc mRNA\nsynthesis at different time points (Fig.\n3A). We conducted the ribopuromycylation assay, and\nthe results showed that TGEV nsp1(37\u201340sg) significantly reduced the\ninhibition of host gene expression (Fig.\n3B). Because the TGEV nsp1(37\u201340sg) protein\nwas found to be insoluble in the Escherichia coli supernatant,\nthe motif (amino acids 37\u201340) was not analyzed further. Based on the\nabove experiments, we focused on TGEV nsp1(91\u201395sg). Finally, the\nribopuromycylation assay demonstrated that the mutant protein no longer\ninhibited host protein synthesis in a dose- or time-dependent manner (Fig. 3, C and\nD). These data indicate that the motif comprising amino\nacids 91\u201395 is critical for TGEV nsp1\u2013induced suppression of host\ngene expression.\n\nTo explore whether a loss of protein activity by TGEV nsp1(91\u201395sg) was\ndue to structural changes, we constructed a TGEV nsp1(91\u201395sg) plasmid.\nExpression and purification were performed as described for the full-length\nconstruct. This new construct yielded crystals under different crystallization\nconditions than those of the full-length protein, and native data were collected\nto 1.98 \u212b. The details of the phasing and refinement steps are given in\nTable 1. A comparison of surface\nelectrostatics and shape between TGEV nsp1 and TGEV nsp1(91\u201395sg) led us\nto speculate that the sg linker mutation from amino acids 91 to 95 did not\nsignificantly change the overall structure of TGEV nsp1 (Fig. 4, A\u2013F).\n\nWe next determined whether this motif (amino acids 91\u201395) plays an\nimportant role in inhibiting host protein synthesis in the context of other\n\u03b1-CoV nsp1 proteins. To explore the corresponding motif in \u03b1-CoV\nnsp1, we selected the previously mentioned representative sequences and aligned\nthem using ClustalW2 software. The \u03b1-CoV nsp1 amino acid sequence\nalignment showed that the motif comprising amino acids 91\u201395 was a\nrelatively conserved domain (Fig.\n5A). Then, we constructed mutant nsp1 proteins from\nFIPV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and PEDV to explore whether the \u03b1-CoV nsp1\nmotif comprising amino acids 91\u201395 was an important region for the\nsuppression of host gene expression. Luciferase assays indicated that the\nimportant function of this motif (amino acids 91\u201395) in inhibiting host\ngene expression not only was exhibited by TGEV nsp1 but also could be extended\nto nsp1 proteins from other \u03b1-CoVs (Fig.\n5B). Furthermore, Western blot analysis revealed\nthat the expression of the mutant proteins was higher than that of the WT\nproteins, especially for TGEV nsp1 and HCoV-NL63 nsp1 (Fig. 5C), consistent with the results of\nthe luciferase assays. In addition, we compared the Rluc values between the\nmutant and the WT nsp1 proteins (Fig.\n5D). These data showed that the relevant motif\n(amino acids 91\u201395) might be responsible for inhibiting host gene\nexpression, albeit to different degrees, among the \u03b1-CoV nsp1 proteins.\nConsistent with our previous results (9),\nwhen we mutated the motif (amino acids 91\u201395) in PEDV nsp1, we again\nobserved partial recovery of the ability to suppress Rluc expression. Taken\ntogether, these results indicated that the motif comprising amino acids\n91\u201395 was an important conserved region for the regulation of host\ntranslation by \u03b1-CoV nsp1.\n\nAlthough \u03b1-CoV nsp1 expression is known to suppress host gene expression,\nits biological functions in viral replication have been largely unexplored. To\nevaluate the role of TGEV nsp1 in inhibiting host gene expression during viral\nreplication, we used our reverse-genetics system to construct a recombinant TGEV\nencoding a mutant nsp1 protein in which ORF3 was replaced by green fluorescent\nprotein (GFP) (19). Based on the\npreviously described results, we replaced the important motif (amino acids\n91\u201395) in the nsp1-coding sequence. In the resulting mutant virus, the\nreplicase gene start codon, translational reading frame, and residues required\nfor proteolytic release of nsp1 from the replicase polyprotein were maintained\n(Fig. 6A). The mutant\nvirus was successfully amplified by transfecting corresponding bacterial\nartificial chromosome (BAC) plasmids into HEK-293T cells. Then, we collected the\namplified virus 24 h after transfection to infect TGEV-susceptible cells.\nCharacteristic green fluorescence consistent with the parental virus phenotype\nwas observed 36 h after infection (Fig.\n6B). The recombinant virus, which was subsequently\nnamed TGEV(91\u201395sg), was verified by sequencing the corresponding\nreplaced regions. To assess the stability of TGEV(91\u201395sg), we analyzed\nthe nsp1-coding region by RT-PCR sequencing after seven passages in PK15 cells,\nand no nucleotide changes were detected. Furthermore, Western blot analysis\nconfirmed that the virus successfully infected PK15 and swine testicle (ST)\ncells (Fig. 6C).\n\nFollowing the successful recovery of TGEV(91\u201395sg), we next evaluated the\nrole of nsp1 in inhibiting host gene expression during viral replication. The\ngrowth properties of TGEV(91\u201395sg) in various cell lines were measured by\nperforming a multistep growth assay with a viral multiplicity of infection of\n0.1. The results showed that both viruses reached a plateau at \u223c48 h\npostinfection in PK15 and ST cells. Furthermore, the viral growth and peak\ntiters of TGEV(91\u201395sg) in susceptible cells were indistinguishable from\nthose of the WT virus, indicating that the nsp1 gene was not\ncritical for viral growth in cell culture (Fig.\n6, D and E). To confirm this\nconclusion, we also tested the nsp1 expression level during viral infection and\nfound that it was indistinguishable between the mutant and WT viruses (Fig. 6C).\n\nTo test the pathogenicity of TGEV(91\u201395sg), an animal experiment was\ncarried out. Piglets that had not been breastfed at birth were randomly divided\ninto two groups with five piglets in each group; in addition, a mock-infected\ncontrol group was formed that contained three piglets. The piglets were orally\ninoculated at a dose of 1 \u00d7 106 50% tissue culture infective\ndose (TCID50) with the respective chimeric virus or mock-infected\nwith Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). The animal experiments showed\nthat replacement of the selected motif (amino acids 91\u201395) reduced the\npathogenic properties of TGEV. Furthermore, in the TGEV group, all five piglets\nexhibited obvious dehydration and weight loss. Severe diarrhea began at 48 h\npostinfection, and all piglets died within 96 h, indicating the acquisition of\nlethal characteristics (Fig.\n7C). Interestingly, the clinical signs were\nsignificantly less severe in the TGEV(91\u201395sg) group than in the TGEV\ngroup (Fig. 7,\nA\u2013C). To further assess the attenuation of\nTGEV(91\u201395sg), we performed post-mortem examinations and hematoxylin and\neosin (H&E) staining. In the TGEV group, the stomach was obviously inflated\nand had undigested flocculate. Moreover, the gastric fundus mucosa was\ncongested, flushed, and bleeding. The stomach wall and small intestinal wall\nbecame thin, which was especially true for the jejunum, and animals presented\nwith intestinal dilation with an abundance of yellow liquid. In the\nTGEV(91\u201395sg) group, the stomach was slightly inflated, and the gastric\nfundus mucosa was not bleeding. The small intestinal wall was slightly thinner\nthan that in the mock group. Overall, the damage to the small intestine and\nstomach in the TGEV group was significantly worse than that in the\nTGEV(91\u201395sg) group (Fig.\n7D). Moreover, H&E staining revealed extensive\nfine damage to different segments of the intestine, characterized by the\nfragmentation and shedding of intestinal villi. The results showed that the\nTGEV(91\u201395sg) group had only mild lesions in both the intestine and\nstomach compared with the TGEV group (Fig.\n7E).\n\nNext, we investigated how nsp1 contributed to the virulence of TGEV by analyzing\nthe viral infection efficiency as reflected by virus shedding (Fig. 8A) and viral tissue\ndistribution (Fig. 8B).\nFecal samples were obtained with fecal swabs, and virus shedding was tested by\nregular PCR. The shedding of these groups was measured on days 1\u20137 and\nwas terminated because of the quick deaths of the infected piglets. At 7 days\npostinoculation, all surviving piglets were euthanized to reduce the stress of\nthe other piglets. The results showed that the challenged piglets had viruses in\ntheir feces. In contrast, no detectable virus shedding was found in the\nmock-infected pigs. Furthermore, we performed sequencing of the corresponding\nreplaced regions to confirm the stability of the infective virus.\nImmunohistochemistry showed that the virus was present in susceptible intestinal\ntissues, consistent with the clinical results. Collectively, these data\ndemonstrate that TGEV(91\u201395sg) is strongly attenuated in\nvivo, and we conclude that the nsp1 gene is\nnecessary for virulence.\n\nMany viral proteins suppress host gene expression and modify host cell environments\nto promote virus-specific translation (20,\n21). As a result of such processes, these\nproteins are often considered important virulence factors that contribute to the\ndesign of live attenuated vaccines. For example, nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of\nthe influenza virus plays a crucial role in replication and pathogenesis by\nsuppressing apoptosis-associated specklike protein ubiquitination; thus, vaccination\nwith a live attenuated H5N1 influenza vaccine lacking NS1 is safe (22\u201324). The virion host\nshutoff (vhs) protein is the key regulator of the induced early host shutoff\nresponse, and herpes simplex viruses with vhs deleted have been proposed as live\nattenuated vaccines (25, 26). Human metapneumovirus protein M2-1\nphosphorylation plays important regulatory roles in RNA synthesis, replication, and\npathogenesis, and inhibition of M2-1 phosphorylation may serve as a novel approach\nfor development of live attenuated vaccines (27).\n\nThis phenomenon is also widely found in CoVs. Envelope proteins affect virulence, and\nan attenuated virus with envelope gene deletion is a promising vaccine candidate\n(28\u201334). Although many viral proteins can induce host translational shutoff,\nnsp1 was the first CoV gene 1 protein recognized to play an important role in\ninhibiting host gene expression to regulate viral replication. In \u03b2-CoVs,\ndeletion of the functional region of nsp1 will be critical for developing attenuated\nvaccines (11, 17, 35). However, the role of\nnsp1 in \u03b1-CoV pathogenesis is unknown. In our study, we replaced the important\nmotif in the TGEV nsp1-coding sequence using our reverse genetics technology. Then,\nwe successfully recovered the mutant virus. Subsequently, the viral growth and peak\ntiters of the mutant virus in susceptible cells were found to be indistinguishable\nfrom those of the WT virus, indicating that the nsp1 gene was not a\ncritical factor driving viral growth in cell culture (Fig. 6, D and E). To confirm this\nconclusion, we also tested the nsp1 expression level during viral infection and\nfound that it was indistinguishable between the mutant and WT viruses (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, the\nanimal experiments revealed that the determinant region within TGEV nsp1 was\ncritical for viral virulence based on gain-of-function studies. Taken together, the\nresults of this study demonstrate, for the first time, that loss of \u03b1-CoV\nnsp1\u2013induced inhibition of host gene expression does not affect viral\nreplication but significantly reduces virulence.\n\nAmong the four CoV genera, only \u03b1-CoV and \u03b2-CoV encode nsp1. Previous\nstudies have indicated that the mechanisms by which nsp1 suppresses host gene\nexpression may differ among CoV species (13\u201315, 36). The mechanisms\nof nsp1-induced host gene suppression have been well-characterized for \u03b2-CoVs.\nNsp1 proteins of bat CoVs have been shown to bind viral RNA and to suppress host\ntranslation (37). SARS-CoV nsp1 uses a\ntwo-pronged strategy to inhibit host gene expression by first interacting with the\n40S ribosomal subunit and then inactivating translation (13). MERS-CoV nsp1 selectively targets transcribed mRNA to\ninhibit host gene expression (14). MHV nsp1\ninterferes efficiently with the type I IFN system to enhance virulence (11). Nonetheless, structural analysis indicates\nthat CoV nsp1s have a common origin (7\u20139)\nand that the nsp1 proteins of \u03b1-CoVs and \u03b2-CoVs share a biological\nfunction to inhibit host gene expression. Furthermore, previous studies have\nrevealed that the C terminus of MHV and SARS-CoV nsp1 is an important functional\nregion for inhibiting host protein synthesis (10, 11). However, the conserved\nimportant domain underlying the \u03b1-CoV nsp1\u2013induced inhibition of host\ngene expression is unclear. Although we have reported that the loops at amino acid\npositions 67\u201371, 78\u201385, and 103\u2013110 generate a stable\nfunctional region (9), this functional domain\nis not present in the TGEV nsp1 protein (12).\nTo identify the common functional domain in \u03b1-CoV nsp1, we selected TGEV nsp1\nas a model. Although the structure of a truncated TGEV nsp1 (PDB code 3ZBD) has been reported (8),\nwe wondered whether the C terminus could affect the overall structure. Subsequently,\nwe determined the structure of full-length TGEV nsp1. Structural characterization\nrevealed that full-length TGEV nsp1 shared a common skeleton with truncated nsp1.\nThese similar conformations suggested that the C terminus had no influence on the\noverall structure of TGEV nsp1. Although the 37\u201340 mutant protein\nsignificantly reduced the inhibition of host gene expression, the mutant virus with\nnsp1(37\u201340sg) was not successful. Although a previous study has also reported\nthat 5\u2032-UTR of coronavirus can effect viral replication (38), we are not sure whether the rescue failure\nof this mutant virus is due to the loss of nsp1 activity or the effect of\n5\u2032-UTR. Through structural analysis and biochemical experiments, we verified\nthat the motif comprising amino acids 91\u201395 was necessary for the inhibition\nof host gene expression by nsp1. Interestingly, this motif could be expanded to\nother representative \u03b1-CoV nsp1 proteins (Fig.\n5). In our study, we found that the motif comprising amino acids\n91\u201395 is a conserved region in \u03b1-CoVs, which is conducive to\nunderstanding the mechanism of \u03b1-CoV nsp1 inhibition of host gene\nexpression.\n\nIn summary, using a reverse-genetics platform, we obtained the first evidence that\nTGEV nsp1 does not affect replication ability but significantly reduces\npathogenicity. We also found that the motif comprising amino acids 91\u201395 in\n\u03b1-CoV nsp1 is a common functional region involved in the inhibition of host\ngene expression. Overall, our results add detail to the molecular mechanism of\n\u03b1-CoV virulence, which might contribute to the design of a novel attenuated\n\u03b1-CoV vaccine based on nsp1 modifications.\n\nHEK-293T and ST cells (ATCC) were maintained at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2\nin Gibco DMEM (high glucose, 4.5 g/liter) containing 10% fetal bovine serum.\nPK15 cells (ATCC) were maintained in Gibco DMEM (low glucose, 1 g/liter)\nsupplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The pBAC-TGEV-GFP plasmid containing a\nfull-length infectious cDNA clone, which was derived from the highly virulent\nTGEV strain WH-1 (GenBankTM accession number HQ462571), has been described previously\n(19). To acquire the TGEV recombinant\nvirus, the plasmid was first transfected into HEK-293T cells, and then the virus\nwas recovered to infect virus-susceptible cells.\n\nFor expression in E. coli, the full-length gene sequence of TGEV\nnsp1 (GenBank accession number HQ462571.1) was cloned into a pET-42b(+) vector with an\nN-terminal His6 tag via PCR amplification. The forward and reverse\nprimers contained the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively. The mutant\nTGEV nsp1 sequence was inserted into pET-42b using the same method.\n\nFor expression in eukaryotic cells, WT nsp1 flanked with an N-terminal\nhemagglutinin (HA) tag was cloned into the PCAGGS vector using the EcoRI and\nXhoI restriction sites. To determine the functional region of TGEV nsp1, we used\na method reported previously (9). The\nfollowing plasmids in which a random coil was replaced with a flexible sg linker\nwere engineered : nsp1(1\u20133sg), nsp1(11\u201315sg),\nnsp1(19\u201322sg), nsp1(37\u201340sg), nsp1(46\u201348sg),\nnsp1(55\u201360sg), nsp1(66\u201369sg), nsp1(76\u201384sg),\nnsp1(91\u201395sg), and nsp1(105\u2013109sg). All of the recombinant\nexpression plasmids were sequenced, and no unexpected mutations occurred.\n\nTo construct the recombinant virus containing mutant nsp1, a method previously\nreported by our laboratory was used (19).\nThe sequences of the relevant primers are shown in Table 2. Each corresponding mutant virus was efficiently\nconstructed using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Briefly, two specific restriction\nsites encompassing the TGEV nsp1 sequence were selected. Then, we synthesized\ntwo types of single-stranded DNA forward primers (sgnsp1F(91\u201395sg) and\nsgnsp1R(91\u201395sg)) and a constant reverse primer (sgRNA) corresponding to\nthe two restriction sites. After performing annealing PCR using the forward and\nreverse primers, the purified short DNA fragments from the PCR products were\ntranscribed using T7 RNA polymerase. The transcribed products corresponding to\nthe two sites were incubated with the nuclease Cas9 to digest the pTGEV-GFP BAC\nplasmid in vitro, and the digestion yielded a linearized BAC\nand an \u223c1.8-kb DNA fragment that included the TGEV nsp1 sequence.\nSpecifically, pTGEV-GFP BAC was digested in a 50-\u03bcl reaction mixture with\n5 \u03bcg of pTGEV-GFP BAC, 5 \u03bcl of Cas9 (New England Biolabs), 10\n\u03bcg of sgRNA, and 5 \u03bcl of Nuclease Reaction Buffer (New England\nBiolabs) at 37 \u00b0C overnight.\n\nFor protein expression, the recombinant plasmid was transformed into E.\ncoli Trans BL21 (DE3) cells, which were grown at 37 \u00b0C in\nlysogeny broth (LB) medium containing 50 \u03bcg/ml kanamycin until the optical\ndensity at 600 nm (OD600) reached 0.6\u20130.8. Then, 1 mm\nisopropyl \u03b2-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to induce cell\ngrowth for 8 h at 27 \u00b0C. Purification was performed using a method reported\npreviously (9). The target protein was\nfurther purified by a Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) column with elution buffer\n(20 mm Tris-HCl and 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). For crystallization,\nthe purified protein was concentrated to \u223c10 mg/ml.\n\nTGEV nsp1 and TGEV nsp1(91\u201395sg) were crystallized via the sitting-drop\nvapor-diffusion method at 20 \u00b0C. Optimal crystals were obtained under the\nfollowing conditions through screening and optimization: 0.5 m nickel\nchloride and 4% PEG3350 for TGEV nsp1 and 0.2 m ammonium phosphate\ndibasic and 23% PEG3350 for TGEV nsp1(91\u201395sg). Single crystals were\nfirst washed with 5, 10, 15 and 30% ethylene glycol (v/v) as a cryoprotectant\nand then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. All data collection steps were\nperformed on beamline BL17U at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility\n(SSRF) using a MAR 225 CCD detector (MAR Research). All of the diffraction\nimages were integrated, merged, and scaled using HKL-3000 software (39). The structures were solved by\nmolecular replacement with PHASER (40)\nusing the truncated structure of TGEV nsp1 (PDB code 3ZBD) as a starting model. Manual model\nbuilding was performed using Coot (41),\nand the structures were refined with Phenix (42). The refinement statistics are shown in Table 1. All of the structural figures were drawn using\nPyMOL (43). The root mean square\ndeviation (r.m.s.d.) was analyzed using PDBeFold (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/ssm/).3 The amino acid sequences of the CoV nsp1\nproteins were aligned using the ClustalW2 software program (44) and visualized with the ESPript 3\nserver (http://espript.ibcp.fr/ESPript/ESPript/)3 (46).\n\nThe functional plasmid and reporter gene plasmids were transfected into HEK-293T\ncells using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer's\ninstructions. At 24 h post-transfection, cell lysates were prepared and\nsubjected to an Rluc reporter activity assay (Promega). A ribopuromycylation\nassay was performed as described previously (9, 45). Briefly, cultured\nHEK-293T cells were transfected with different doses of the different plasmids.\nAt various time points post-transfection, the cells were pulse-labeled with 3\n\u03bcm puromycin and then incubated for an additional hour at 37\n\u00b0C with 5% CO2.\n\nTo determine the success of plasmid transfection or virus infection in the cells,\ncell samples were collected for treatment. For treatment, the cells were first\ngently washed twice with precooled PBS and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5\nmin. The supernatant was discarded, radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer\n(Beyotime) was added, and the samples were incubated with rotation at 4 \u00b0C\nfor 20 min. The extracts were prepared in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Protein\nexpression was analyzed via Western blotting. The proteins were visualized using\nan anti-HA antibody (Ab; Signalway Antibody (SAB)), an anti-puromycin Ab\n(Millipore), an anti-TGEV N Ab (provided by the laboratory), and an anti-TGEV\nnsp1 Ab (provided by the laboratory). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase\n(GAPDH) expression was detected with an anti-GAPDH monoclonal Ab (mAb;\nProteintech) to confirm equal protein loading. The corresponding grayscale value\nof each protein band was analyzed with ImageJ.\n\nQuantitative analysis of mRNA was performed as described previously (9). Briefly, RNA was extracted from the\ntissue or cell samples, and a reverse transcription kit (Toyobo) was used to\nquantitatively reverse transcribe 100 ng of RNA in a 20-\u03bcl system. The\nreverse transcription program was performed according to the instructions of the\nreverse transcription kit (Toyobo). The target mRNA and the endogenous control\nRNA (18S rRNA) were amplified with a TaqMan One-Step Real-time PCR Master Mix\nReagent kit (Bio-Rad). Following the manufacturer's instructions, PCR was\nperformed on an ABI PRISM 7000 real-time thermocycler (Applied Biosystems,\nFoster City, CA). The amount of target mRNA was normalized to the amount of\nendogenous 18S rRNA.\n\nThe coordinates and structural characteristics of TGEV nsp1 and TGEV\nnsp1(91\u201395sg) were submitted to the Research Collaboratory for Structural\nBioinformatics (RCSB) under PDB accession numbers 6IVC\nand 6IVD, respectively. Unpaired Student's\nt test and one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni\ncorrection (Prism version 6.01, GraphPad Software) were used to analyze\ndifferences between groups. * indicates a significant difference\n(p < 0.05), ** indicates a highly significant difference\n(p < 0.01), and *** indicates an extremely significant\ndifference (p < 0.001).\n\nThirteen 1-day-old piglets from a TGEV-free sow were randomly divided into three\ngroups and fed fresh liquid milk diluted in warm water every 3 h. All piglets\nwere confirmed to be free of TGEV, PEDV, porcine deltacoronavirus, and rotavirus\nby RT-PCR analysis of piglet feces before viral challenge. The piglet weights\nwere measured and recorded at the beginning of the challenge. The piglet\nchallenge group was inoculated orally with chimeric viral particles at a dose of\n1 \u00d7 106 TCID50 or mock-inoculated with 500 \u03bcl\nof DMEM. At 7 days postinoculation, all surviving piglets were euthanized to\nreduce the stress of the other piglets. Before necropsy, the weight of every\npiglet was recorded. At necropsy, four sections of the intestine (duodenum,\njejunum, ileum, and large intestine) and the stomach were collected, fixed in\n10% formalin for histopathological examination, and stained with H&E.\n\nThe animal experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the\nScientific Ethics Committee of Huazhong Agricultural University (permit number\nHZAUSW-2018-009). Animal care and maintenance procedures were in compliance with\nthe recommendations by the Regulations for the Administration of Affairs\nConcerning Experimental Animals provided by the Ministry of Science and\nTechnology of China.\n\nZ.
