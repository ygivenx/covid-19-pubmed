{"title": "Susceptibility of rodent cell lines to rat coronaviruses and differential enhancement by trypsin or DEAE-dextran", "body": "Rat coronaviruses (RCVs), notably sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) and Parker's rat coronavirus (PRCV), infect laboratory rats at high prevalence, cause clinically and economically significant disease and interfere with research using rats [7] . Diagnostic and experimental studies of RCVs have been limited by the lack of a reliable cell line in which to grow the viruses [7] . RCVs have traditionally been grown in primary rat kidney (PRK) cells or infant mouse brain but these techniques require the use of animals and are labor intensive. Although many coronaviruses have fastidious growth requirements, replicating only in organ cultures or cell lines derived from the animal or tissue of origin, cell lines supporting growth of most coronaviruses have been identified [5, 7] . Attempts to grow SDAV in a variety of rodent cell lines, including mouse neuroblastoma (clone N18) cells, C6 rat glial cells, and MHV-susceptible cell lines such as NCTC 1469 cells failed (L. E. Garlinghouse and A. L. Smith, unpubl, data) . Recently H i r a n o et al. reported that a rat m a m m a r y adenocarcinoma cell line (LBC) supported R C V growth [-4] , and Percy et al. reported that L2 cells supported R C V s [11] . In studies reported here, L B C cells, L2 cells and 13 other cell lines o f rodent origin were tested for their susceptibility to RCVs. A rat bladder epithelial cell line (RBL-02) was identified which supports R C V growth. M e d i u m containing trypsin or diethylaminoethyl-dextran ( D E A E -D ) , which have been used to enhance the growth of other coronaviruses [17, 19] , also differentially enhanced R C V growth in selected cell lines.\n\nThe cell lines tested and media used are listed in Table 1 . HH cells were obtained by in vitro transformation of PRK cells [-9] by high multiplicity infection with SV-40 [20] . Cell cultures were grown in 25 cm 2 polystyrene flasks (Corning Glassworks, Corning, NY) at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified 5 % CO, atmosphere and were maintained in media containing 100 gg/ ml streptomycin and 100 units/ml penicillin. All media and supplements were purchased from GIBCO BRL (Gaithersburg, MD), except MCDB-151 and F-12 media (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). Cells were transferred when confluent using 0.12% trypsin and 0.27 mM EDTA. Two sublines of L2 cells obtained from different laboratories were used (Table 1) . Cell lines received from extramural sources except the American Type Culture Collection were tested for Mycoplasma spp. and were culture-negative.\n\nStocks of SDAV, strain 681 (SDAV-681), and Parker's rat coronavirus (PRCV) were prepared in infant mouse brain [-2, 3] . Titration of PRCV and SDAV-681 stocks in primary rat kidney cells [2, 3] yielded titers of 107 TCIDs0 and 10 6.5 TCIDs0 per ml, respectively. The SDAV stock used for concurrent L2 and mouse titration was one infant mouse passage removed from the stock used for cell culture inoculations.\n\nCr: ORL Sencar dams with litters were purchased (Animal Genetics and Production Branch, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and housed under conditions which met or exceeded standards of the U.S. Public Health Service.\n\nWhen cell monolayers were approximately 80% confluent, growth medium (Table 1) was removed and cultures were exposed to 1.0 ml of a 1% suspension of virus-infected mouse brain or 1.0 ml of diluent. Fetal calf serum (FCS) was omitted from medium used for trypsin-or DEAE-D-treated cells. Following virus absorption at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, 4ml of medium were added to all flasks. Cultures were observed daily. Cytopathic effect (CPE) was typified by syncytium formation. The percentage of the monolayer that consisted of syncytia was estimated, and all infected and mock-inoculated cultures were harvested at 72 h post-inoculation. Air-dried, fixed cells were incubated with SDAV-immune mouse ascitic fluid or with pooled SDAV-immune serum from experimentally infected rats followed by incubation with fluoresceinated goat anti-species immunoglobulin (Antibodies, Inc., Davis, CA) containing 0.01% Evans's blue [14] . Cells were examined at a magnification of x 200 with a transmitted light fluorescence microscope.\n\nConcentrations of porcine parvovirus-free, Mycoptasma-free trypsin (GIBCO BRL) from 0.016 gg/ml to 40 gg/ml were added to the absorption and incubation media for L2 (Percy) and RBL-02 cells. Since some tissue homogenates in combination with 16 ~tg/ml trypsin were toxic to L2 (Percy) cells, 1.6 gg/mt of trypsin was used. Trypsin-treated uninoculated cells were included at each concentration to control for toxicity. Four ml of trypsincontaining medium were added for incubation.\n\nConcentrations of 0, 50, 100, 200 and 400 ~tg/ml of DEAE-D (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Uppsala, Sweden) were added to the pre-absorption and absorption media of LBC, L2 (Percy) and RBL-02 cells to allow sufficient time for action on cell membranes. Duplicate cultures were pre-treated with DEAE-D-containing medium for 4 h, and virus or diluent was added for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C [19] . DEAE-D containing medium was replaced with growth medium for incubation.\n\nNasal washes, lungs and salivary and lacrimal glands from control rats or rats experimentally infected with SDAV-681 were provided by Dr. Eleanor C. Weir, Yale University. The tissues had previously been tested for the presence of infectious virus by intracerebral inoculation of infant mice [21] and had been stored at -70 \u00b0C until use in this study. One ml of a 3-5% (w/v) tissue homogenate in trypsin-containing medium (1.6 ~tg/ml) was used for inoculation of L2 (Percy) cells. Because lacrimal and salivary gland inocula were toxic to L2 (Percy) cells, they were removed following absorption. Nasal wash and lung inocula were not removed. Cells were examined daily for CPE by an observer uninformed of their status in the prior mouse inoculation study. Cells were subsequently processed and stained for viral antigen.\n\nSerial ten-fold dilutions of stock SDAV-681 virus were inoculated intracerebrally into 2day old Sencar mice and into flasks containing L2 (Percy) cells in trypsin (1.6gg/ml)supplemented medium. Mouse mortality at each dilution was recorded for 14 days. L2 (Percy) cells were observed daily for CPE and were stained for viral antigen 72h after inoculation. Titers expressed as LDs0 or TCIDs0 per ml were calculated [12] . tibility of L2 (Percy) cells to PRCV was erratic. Less than 5% of the monolayer formed syncytia, and antigen-positive cells ( < 5%) were seen on the first passage in half of the attempts, whereas PRCV growth was not detected in the remaining attempts. Seven additional passages did not enhance PRCV growth.\n\nRBL-02 cells SDAV-681 and PRCV grew in the first passage in RBL-02 cells. Syncytia involving 5% of the monolayer formed within 48 h (Fig. 1) and antigen-positive cells (about 5%) were seen by IF staining (Fig. 2) . CPE was not seen in the second passage, and fewer cells contained antigen. Virus growth was not detected in the third through seventh passages.\n\nRepeated attempts, including 11 blind passages, failed to reveal growth of SDAV-681 or PRCV in LBC cells. CPE was not seen, and virus antigen was not detected.\n\nOther cell lines RCV growth was not detected in other cell lines listed in Table 1 . At least 2 passage attempts of both SDAV-681 and PRCV were completed in all cell lines. \n\nTrypsin enhanced growth o f R C V s in L2 (Percy) cells in the first passage ( Table 2) \n\nConcentrations o f 50-400 gg/ml of D E A E -D substantially enhanced growth of R C V s in L B C cells, enhanced growth marginally in R B L -0 2 cells, and did not affect growth in L2 (Percy) cells (Table 3 ). Viral antigen was not detected in mock-treated, inoculated L B C cells, b u t a b o u t 10% of non-adherent cells were virus antigen-positive in treated, inoculated cultures following exposure to \n\nIn a single attempt to isolate SDAV-681 from the lung of an experimentally infected rat, syncytia and viral antigen were first seen after 6 passages in untreated L2 (Percy) cells. In contrast, syncytia and antigen were observed in the first passage in trypsin-treated L2 (Percy) cells. Based on this finding, a small study was initiated to ascertain the sensitivity of trypsin-treated L2 (Percy) cells for primary isolation of RCVs. Virus isolations were attempted using tissue homogenates previously tested for SDAV-681 by infant mouse inoculation (Table 4 ). CPE and virus antigen were observed in 57% and 69%, respectively, of cultures exposed to viruspositive tissues. The highest concordance between mouse and L2 (Percy) cell inoculation (88%) was obtained using nasal wash as the inoculum.\n\nA single stock of SDAV was quantified concurrently in infant mice and trypsin-treated L2 (Percy) cells. The titer of stock SDAV-681 w a s 10 6.4 LDso per ml in infant mice and 10 4.5 TCIDs0 per ml in trypsin-treated L2 (Percy) cells.\n\nLimited RCV growth was demonstrated in untreated L2 (Percy) and RBL-02 cells, but not in other celt lines tested, including LBC cells and an L2 subtine obtained from another source. A recent observation of SDAV antigen in transitional epithelium of experimentally infected athymic rats [21] led us to assess rat bladder epithelial cell lines for growth of RCVs, and RBL-02 cells supported RCV growth on initial passage. Of the cell lines and treatments tested, L2 (Percy) cells treated with trypsin supported maximal growth of RCVs as evidenced by syncytium formation and viral antigen. RCV growth in L2 (Percy) cells was not enhanced by trypsin treatment of later passages when the enzyme was added at the time of virus inoculation. Adding trypsin at a different time in the RCV replicative cycle might enhance RCV growth in successive passages. As previously reported by Percy etal. [11] , repeated passage of SDAV-681 in untreated L2 (Percy) cells increased viral growth. Repeated passage of other animal-adapted RCV strains in L2 (Percy) cells may accomplish adaptation and increased virus yield.\n\nTrypsin, but not DEAE-D, enhanced RCV growth in L2 (Percy) cells. The mechanism by which trypsin increases RCV growth in these cells is not known. However, trypsin enhances mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) plaque formation [15, 19-] and cleaves the 180k E2 glycoprotein of MHV A59 into two 90k fragments [17] . Cleavage is associated with a two-fold increase in infectivity and with activation of the cell-fusing activities of virions in vivo [16, 17] . Therefore, trypsin could enhance RCV infectivity by cleaving its E2 protein analogue.\n\nTrypsin treatment of L2 (Percy) cells permitted primary isolation of SDAV from tissues of infected rats without repeated passage. The use of trypsin-treated L2 (Percy) cells to screen tissues for RCVs would significantly reduce animal use and expense. However, L2 (Percy) cells were about 2 log10 less sensitive than infant mice based on comparative titration of SDAV-681. This may have been due to adaptation of stock SDAV-681 to infant mouse brain by virtue of multiple prior passages in mice. If trypsin-treated L2 (Percy) cells are inherently less sensitive than infant mice, tissues that are virus-negative by assay in these cells should be re-tested in mice to eliminate false negatives. Uninfected L2 (Percy) cells are morphologically heterogeneous and sensitive to tissue toxicity; therefore, antigen detection which is less subjective than interpretation of morphologic changes should be the definitive test used after cell culture inoculation.\n\nUsing trypsin-treated L2 (Percy) cells, virus in lacrimal gland was more difficult to detect than virus in other tissues tested. A possible explanation for low isolation rates from lacrimal gland is the presence of a trypsin-inhibitor that is not present in other tissues. However, litters of mice inoculated with lacrimal gland homogenates tended to have lower mortality rates and deaths that occurred later than in groups inoculated with other tissues (data not shown). This suggests that lacrimal gland samples may simply have contained lower concentrations of virus.\n\nRCV growth was increased in LBC and RBL-02 cells treated with DEAEdextran, a chemical that enhances virus binding and uptake by altering electrostatic interactions [1] . This result suggests that virus attachment and/or penetration are the limiting steps for RCV growth in these cell lines. DEAE-D also enhances infection of cells with MHV-3 [19] , although the mechanism is unknown. Studies of binding and internalization with M H V -J H M have shown, however, that several rat cell lines share a common deficiency at the level of virus internalization [7] . D E A E -D may act by enhancing RCV binding to LBC and RBL-02 cells, thereby facilitating viral entry into cells that otherwise support RCV growth.\n\nLittle is known about the replication and biochemistry of RCVs largely due to their fastidious in vitro growth requirements. Our described refinements of in vitro growth conditions for RCVs should facilitate both in vitro and in vivo studies. Repeated passage of rat-adapted RCV isolates and RCV growth in L2 (Percy) and RBL-02 ceils may increase virus yield and permit more sophisticated studies of antigenic relatedness among RCV isolates. Use of trypsin-treated L2 (Percy) cells should facilitate in vivo studies of RCV pathogenesis requiring RCV isolation."}
