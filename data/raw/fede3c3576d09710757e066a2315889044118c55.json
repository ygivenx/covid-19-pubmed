{"title": "Integrated infection control strategy to minimize nosocomial infection of corona virus disease 2019 among ENT healthcare workers", "body": "sore throat and sneeze [1, 2] . COVID-19 has rapidly spread from Wuhan, throughout China and into other countries. The virus-specific nucleic acid sequences have been detected in lung fluid, throat, oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swab samples [3] . Due to lack of sufficient awareness of the COVID-19 in the early stages of the epidemic, some healthcare workers (HCWs) have been infected [4, 5] . Patients with symptoms of VOVID-19 may present to Ear Nose and Throat ENT Departments. To decrease the density of patients, the ENT department separated the waiting area from the treatment area, reduced the number of appointments, scheduled appointments at different times, and increased online consulting services. In addition, taking account of the facts that the median age of COVID-19 patients was 59 years and that morbidity and mortality is greater in the elderly [4] , HCWs older than 65 years of age were suspended from outpatient activities. Further, our escalation plan is that if the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise, only emergency services will be maintained.\n\nAmong ENT examinations, nose and throat examinations were considered to present the highest risk, and additional protective measures were implemented. During flexible laryngoscope examination, to reduce irrigated nausea and cough, local anesthetic spray was replaced by gel anaesthesia, and the smallest possible diameter laryngoscope was recommended. During nasal endoscopy, care was taken to ensure adequate surface anesthesia to reduce the sneeze reflex.\n\nOn the ward, temperature monitoring was conducted at the entrance for all persons, an epidemiological history was taken from all patients, and everyone on the ward was required to wear a surgical mask. Vital signs were monitored every 4 hours for patients, and temperatures were taken twice daily from caregivers. In order to reduce the crowding of the ward, visiting was restricted to a single visitor. An emergency isolation ward was established to manage suspected patients. Thus, chest x-ray or CT are required pre-operatively on elective surgical patients, along with virological testing for COVID-19 in suspected patients [6] .\n\nENT patients ifetn undergo aerosol generating procedures during nursing care. To manage the risks associated with these open-type suction was replaced by closed suction for patients with tracheotomy. Suction was used before tracheal nursing in procedure to minimize sputum production during the nursing procedure. Aerosol inhalation was replaced by in-tube infusion or spray humidification to humidify the trachea as well.\n\nUp to February 20, 2020, a total of 4148 fever cases visited in our hospital, of which 22 cases were confirmed as COVID-19. Up to now, no nosocomial infection has occurred in WCH, including the ENT department. We hope that this report of our experience will assist infection prevention and control teams with setting up precautionary measures in their facilities.\n\nNone.\n\nNone.\n\nAll authors have made substantial contributions to all of the following:\n\n(1) Dan Lu drafted the manuscript.\n\n(2) Haiyang Wang and Rong Yu revised the manuscript.\n\n(3)Hui Yang and Yu Zhao designed the conception, and revised the manuscript for the important intellectual content."}
