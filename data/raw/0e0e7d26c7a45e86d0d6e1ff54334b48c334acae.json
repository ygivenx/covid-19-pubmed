It is also important to identify evidencecompounds are already being tested in phase I or phase II trials:\n\nbased treatment methods to avoid the unjustified consumption of pleconaril, RSV 604 (A 60444), and RF I641. [52, 105] However, financial resources. In this context, systemic treatment with cortineither ribavirin nor any of the new therapeutic agents active costeroids [31, 111, 112] or inhalation treatment with beta mimetics or against RSV have been assessed or licensed for use in children adrenaline (epinephrine) [31, 111, 112] should be investigated critically. with recurrent wheezing or asthma. [52] For example, in epidemiologic studies published up till 2005, The respiratory viruses most frequently detected in school-age 26-44% of all HMPV-infected hospitalized pediatric patients rechildren with asthma are the rhinoviruses. While no specific ceived systemic corticosteroids, and half of them were treated with treatment against rhinoviruses is available yet, an increasing numbronchodilators. Due to the increasing number of clinically releber of promising drug candidates are under development or even in vant viral respiratory pathogens and also the increasing number of the early phase of clinical trials. One of these drugs that has newly developed antiviral drugs, the absolute prerequisite for a successfully passed a phase II clinical trial is rupintrivir, [106] a specific treatment remains a rapid and specific diagnostic apselective irreversible inhibitor of the rhinoviral 3C-protease which proach. is administered intranasally. It is a peptidomimetic compound with Specific therapy options for viral infections are summarized in poor aqueous solubility and low oral bioavailability in animals, [107] but it was well tolerated in healthy adult volunteers. [108] Pleconaril table I.\n\nTaken together, results from Italy [69, 113] and France [18] support the use of antimicrobials in patients with asthma and microbiologically confirmed M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae infection. Schmidt et al. [114] recently demonstrated that in children with therapy-refractory bronchitis or pneumonia, bronchial C. pneumoniae co-infection was associated with more severe disease. In their study, and others, [87, 115] adequate antibacterial therapy for C. pneumoniae infection was shown to improve pulmonary function. Figure 1 presents an algorithm for the management of atypical pulmonary infections in patients with asthma or recurrent wheezing.\n\nIn this context, the principle aims of treatment are:\n\n\u2022 The infection should be eradicated, not only suppressed. [79, 80, 116] However, this seems to be not so easy to achieve in C. pneumoniae infections. Therefore, some authors recommend an empirical second cycle of treatment if symptoms persist or recur. [90] \u2022 Relief of acute symptoms in patients with acute infection should be prompt (those infections are self-limiting diseases in immunocompetent persons).\n\n\u2022 The number and the severity of recurrent wheezing exacerbations during follow up should be reduced. [18, 69] \u2022 The inflammatory stimulus of chronic pulmonary infection with atypical pathogens on the underlying pulmonary disease should be stopped and the adverse effects of the cellular and humoral immune response on bronchial hyperreactivity should be contained. [19, 21, 113] The microbiologic targets are obligate intracellular organisms (C. pneumoniae) or bacteria without a common Gram-positive/ Gram-negative cell wall, rendering both pathogens a priori resistant to all \u03b2-lactams, glycopeptides, and carbapenems. In addition, M. pneumoniae is not susceptible to sulfonamides, rifampicin, or linezolid.\n\nFirst-line agents for the treatment of infections due to M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae in children are the macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, or roxithromycin) and the azalide azithromycin. Erythromycin and clarithromycin are available as also individual local legal restrictions, may limit the use of an intravenous preparations if the condition of the child does not antimicrobial agent. allow oral medication. In children \u22658 years of age, intravenous doxycycline may be used as a feasible alternative, although there Third-line agents for the treatment of atypical pneumonia in are no comparative studies on the use of doxycycline in children severely immunocompromised children and adolescents are the and adolescents besides its use in the treatment of tick-borne fluoroquinolones (i.e. levofloxacin and moxifloxacin) or the infections, melioidosis, or brucellosis. [117] [118] [119] [120] However, at least in ketolide telithromycin. Due to potential toxicities, [121] licensing the US, azithromycin is available for intravenous use, but not issues and general considerations not to increase selective pressure clarithromycin, demonstrating that not only scientific reasons, but on resistant pathogens, [122] the use of these agents is not standard in children with recurrent wheezing or asthma, and are thus beyond may be combined without subsequent problems, e.g. for example the scope of this review.\n\nwith cyclosporin after stem cell or organ transplantation.
