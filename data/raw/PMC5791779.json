{"title": "Pandemic risk: how large are the expected losses?", "body": "Few doubt that major epidemics and pandemics will strike again and few would argue that the world is adequately prepared. Since the 2013\u20132016 Ebola virus disease outbreak in western Africa, the United States National Academy of Medicine1 and several other groups2\u20134 have pointed to gaps, and the need for greater investment, in preparation against epidemics and pandemics, of Ebola virus disease and other infectious diseases. Attempts to justify greater investment have mostly been based on estimates of the industrial and macroeconomic losses attributable to influenza pandemics.5\u201311 We have recently extended the loss assessment to include a valuation of the lives lost as a result of the increases in mortality resulting from influenza-pandemic risk.12 The inclusion of such a valuation increased the estimated loss attributable to modelled pandemic risk several fold. Below, we discuss our method and summarize our findings. Box 1 presents the definition of several of the terms we are using in this paper.\n\nWe searched Google Scholar and PubMed\u00ae for studies on the economic losses from influenza. Almost all of the previous studies examined economic losses in terms of income and ignored the value of, and the loss associated with, mortality risk. The World Bank, for example, generated estimates of global income losses under different influenza pandemic scenarios.10,11 It found that a pandemic of the same severity as the 1918 influenza pandemic might reduce global gross domestic product by about 5% and that the disruptive effects of avoiding infection would account for about 60% of that reduction. Another study of the consequences of a range of pandemic severities included an extremely severe scenario that would lead to income losses of over 12% of gross national income worldwide, including losses of over 50% of the gross national incomes of lower-income countries.5 We found other integrative estimates of the magnitude of pandemic risk in two partially proprietary sources.17,18\n\nSeveral studies have examined specific dimensions of the economic impacts of annual influenza, such as direct costs, e.g. medical and hospitalizations costs, and indirect costs, e.g. lost earnings due to illness and productivity costs. There are examples of such studies based in the Americas,6,7,19\u201322 Asia8,23 and Europe.24,25 Other models have added an estimated value of the intrinsic undesirability of nonfatal illness or of pandemic fear, as seen in the population response to severe acute respiratory syndrome in Asia.8 Media coverage may also lead populations to overreact to mild pandemics.9\n\nWe found only two articles that included estimates of the loss from the elevated mortality associated with influenza pandemics.8,19 Of the 10 studies included in a recent systematic literature review on the costs of influenza,26 only one19 took account of the value of mortality risks.\n\nOne strand of economic research has examined the intrinsic value of mortality risks, which is commonly expressed as the so-called value of a statistical life. This value is derived either from questionnaires that canvass how much compensation an individual would demand, to accept a small increase in the probability of their death,1 or from quantitative studies of the labour market that investigate the trade-offs between small fatality risks and income.2,27\n\nBeyond influenza, the value of mortality risks has been included in estimating the costs of vaccine-preventable diseases28 and in evaluating the economic burdens posed by rheumatic heart disease.29 Far more studies have assessed the burden of specific environmental risk factors.13,14\n\nThe value of a statistical life, which is sometimes expressed as the value of a standardized mortality unit (SMU), i.e. an increase in the annual risk of death of 1 in 10 000, varies by both the age and income of the individual involved.15,16,27 In general, the value of mortality is elastic to age and to income, i.e. younger individuals place a higher value on mortality than older individuals, and higher-income individuals generally value mortality more than lower-income individuals. The main findings of our recent study appeared consistent when, in robustness and sensitivity checks, we used estimates that were unconditional on age and estimates with varying income elasticity with respect to the value of mortality.12\n\nFollowing common practice in the insurance industry, we defined risk, r(s), in terms of the annual probability of a pandemic having a severity exceeding s SMUs and the return time for s as the expected number of years before a pandemic of at least severity s will occur. If t(s) is the return time, then t(s) = r(s)\u22121. For example, if the annual probability of a pandemic of severity at least s is 1%, then its return time will be 100 years.\n\nIf we had access to a function r(s) showing exceedance probability as a function of severity, our analysis could proceed using the expected value of severity of all pandemics. Because r(s) is the complementary cumulative of the density for s, we would have expected value of:\n\nWe calibrated this model using historical estimates of the frequency and severity of influenza pandemics, which we obtained from our literature search on PubMed\u00ae and Google Scholar. For mortality data relating to the 1918 influenza pandemic, we also searched the libraries at Harvard University and the University of Hawai\u2018i for historical documents and life tables. Studies were restricted to those with abstracts in English.\n\nLike other economic studies of pandemic influenza, we identified two main influenza pandemic scenarios in terms of aggregate mortality: moderate and severe. Our review classified the 1918 pandemic as severe. As the world population in 1918 was about 1830 million and historical data indicate that there were at least 20 million pandemic-related deaths in that year, the excess death rate associated with the pandemic was at least 1.1%. A closer examination of the data from India indicate that the true global rate was probably far higher than 1.1%, the pandemic led to 14 million deaths in India36\u201338 and it seems implausible that India accounted for 73% of all of the pandemic-related deaths at a time when it had 18% of the world population. However, to be conservative, we estimated an expected annual excess mortality rate of 0.93 SMUs. In the corresponding model for moderate pandemics, we used a global expected excess mortality rate of 0.05 SMUs, as seen in historical moderate pandemics.39\n\nOur calibration pointed to a very fat-tailed distribution.12 Thus, compared with an exponential function, the hyperbolic family of complementary cumulative distributions provided more natural candidates for r(s). We parameterized the hyperbolic function in terms of its expectation and the fatness of its tail.40 Thus:r(s) = [1 + m(1 \u2013 f)s] \u2013 [1 + 1/(1 \u2013 f)](2)where f indicates the fatness of the tail, with smaller values implying a fatter tail. We estimate a value of f of -2. It had previously been estimated that, in 2015, a 1918-type pandemic would have killed 21 million to 33 million people, with a return time of 100\u2013200 years.35 Our models produced similar values. Recent estimates of influenza and pneumonia mortality18,31 are also consistent with our all-cause mortality estimates. Our estimates are based on assumptions that are probably quite conservative. Substantially greater severities and likelihoods have been discussed elsewhere.5,35,41,42\n\nWe used our estimated exceedance probability function and empirically estimated values for small changes in mortality risk to calculate the expected i.e. mortality-inclusive, value of losses associated with a moderate or severe influenza pandemic. At 2013 values, the expected losses for 2015 amounted to about 500 billion United States dollars (US$), i.e. about 0.6% of global income, per year.12 The estimated proportion of annual national income represented by the losses varied according to country income grouping, from a little over 0.3% in high-income countries to 1.6% in lower-middle-income countries (Table 1).\n\nThe expected-loss framework distinguishes between the loss associated with a certain event that occurred, e.g. the mortality that occurred as a result of the 1918 influenza pandemic, and the expected loss associated with an uncertain event over a period of risk exposure. The expected loss combines both the risk of a moderate or severe pandemic and the losses from that event should the event occur. The expected-loss framework thus produces estimates of expected losses of an uncertain event, rather than actual losses of a certainly occurring event. We estimated the expected number of pandemic-related deaths to be about 720 000 per year. This level of mortality is on a similar scale to that attributable to other, more certain, causes of death, including other major infectious causes of death.12\n\nImportantly, we concluded that most of the expected loss from influenza pandemics results from extreme events. Another effort to estimate exceedance probability functions indicated that, among all pathogens that can cause a pandemic, influenza virus was likely to be the predominant cause of pandemic-related mortality.18 The implication is clear: any efforts at pandemic preparedness need to be most strongly focused on influenza and on preparation for a severe scenario.\n\nOur results present losses much higher than those found in studies limited to income losses. Income losses have been estimated to represent around 15% and 50% of the total economic losses associated with a severe pandemic and a mild pandemic, respectively.5,11 In previous studies, across modelled pandemics of all severities, mean income losses were estimated to be US$ 80 billion per year5,11, i.e. about 16% of our estimate of total pandemic-related costs.\n\nIn terms of the percentage of global income, our estimate of total pandemic-related losses (0.6%) falls within the corresponding Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s estimates of the costs of global warming (0.2\u20132.0%).43 However, the magnitude of future global warming and the associated economic losses are still uncertain.44,45 The same is true for future pandemics. Many of the hundreds of studies on the potential costs of climate change46 have been hampered by the wide variation in estimates of the so-called social cost of carbon.47 If this cost is set at about US$ 120 per tonne, the cost of the carbon dioxide emissions in 2013 would have been about 1% of global income.46,48 As in many previous attempts to estimate the economic losses associated with a pandemic, many previous attempts to estimate the social costs of carbon have focused on national income accounts, without any explicit valuation of the increases in mortality resulting from climate change. The mortality-associated costs of climate change may be relatively small, however, since the slowness of climate change should allow for compensatory human adaptation.\n\nOur study had several limitations. First, we ignored the intrinsic undesirability of nonfatal illness and/or pandemic fear. Intense media coverage may lead populations to overreact to mild pandemics. Second, our estimates of future pandemic risk and severity, and the economic estimates based on these epidemiological estimates, are relatively crude partly because pandemics remain rare and uncertain events. Future modelling should lead to improved estimates over time. Third, the assignment of monetary value to small changes in mortality risk and, particularly the relationship between valuation of such risk and both individual income and age at death, remains controversial. However, the results of sensitivity analyses, in which we applied a range of assumptions on these parameters, indicated that our main findings were reasonably robust.\n\nIn addition to pathogens of pandemic potential, an expected-loss framework may also be applied usefully to malaria and other diseases that have fluctuating incidence. As cases of the disease become rarer as the result of effective interventions, malaria becomes less visible politically and financially, and policy-makers in some countries may have responded by reducing control efforts prematurely. Policy-makers, and the societies they serve, could benefit by using an expected-loss framework to estimate the losses associated with uncertain and rare events across the full range of potential outcome severities. This could lead to appropriate and beneficial adjustments to each policy-maker\u2019s sense of risk and sense of value and to improved national policies on epidemic and pandemic preparedness. A recent United States National Academy of Medicine report argued that, given the risks we estimated, policy attention has fallen short.49,50 National efforts at pandemic preparedness have benefits beyond national borders. Some have therefore argued that, for the global good, resources for development assistance should be used to provide incentives for national investments and international collaborations in such preparedness.3"}
