{"title": "Chloroquine use improves dengue-related\nsymptoms", "body": "We set up a double-blind, randomised study that administered either\nchloroquine or placebo (starch) to patients suspected of having dengue disease.\nPatients were included in the study if they presented with dengue-related symptoms,\nsuch as fever and at least two other symptoms, such as headache, retro-orbital pain,\nmuscle and bone or joint pain, nausea, vomiting and rash, for less than 72 h.\nPatients were excluded if they were pregnant, younger than 18 years old or had\neither cardiac or neurologic disease. Once entered into the study, the patients were\nrandomised in a double-blind fashion to receive either 500 mg chloroquine (300 mg\nbase) BID or an identical-appearing placebo BID for three days (control group). In\naddition to the use of either chloroquine or placebo, both groups were similarly\ntreated with hydration and symptomatic medication, such as analgesic and antipyretic\ndrugs, according to medical prescription.\n\nThree diagnostic tests were performed according to well-defined protocols\n[reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, IgM antibody capture ELISA and the\nnon structural 1 (NS1) antigen detection] on all the samples (Innis et al. 1989, Lanciotti\net al. 1992, Dussart et al. 2006,\nCastro-Jorge et al. 2010). Dengue was\nconfirmed when at least two diagnostic tests were positive. The patients were\nre-evaluated one week later and clinical data associated with dengue symptoms, such\nas fever, headache, retro-orbital pain, muscle, bone or joint pain, nausea and\nvomiting were recorded as well as symptoms related to the side effects of\nchloroquine. The axillary temperature was objectively measured and considered\nabnormal (fever) when \u2265 37.8\u00b0C. Other variables were obtained actively and\nobjectively during a medical consultation using a research form.\n\nThis trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00849602). The study\nwas approved by the Ethical Committee of the Clinical Hospital of the School of\nMedicine of Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, process 12603/2006, and written\ninformed consent was obtained from all participants.\n\nThe data are presented as the means \u00b1 standard deviations and number of\npatients (%). Differences between the two study groups were assessed using an\nunpaired t test for continuous outcomes and Fisher's exact test for\nproportions. All p values were two-sided and all analyses were performed with the\nuse of GraphPad Software, version 3.05 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).\n\nThe study was conducted from mid-February to the first week of May of\n2008. One hundred thirty-two patients were assessed for eligibility: three did not\nmeet the inclusion criteria and 129 underwent randomisation. The patients enrolled\nin the study were adults (mean age, 31.64 \u00b1 11.74 years), were predominantly female\n(51.2%) and reported a mean average duration of symptoms of 41.52 \u00b1 20.16 h. Of the\n129 patients, 63 were randomised to receive chloroquine and 66 were randomised to\nreceive placebo. Seventy-five patients had other febrile diseases (OFDs) and 54 were\nconfirmed to have dengue. Of the dengue patients, 17 refused to participate and 37\ncompleted the study. Of these patients, 19 received chloroquine (mean age, 32.72 \u00b1\n11.50 years; male, 42%; duration of symptoms, 1.94 \u00b1 0.90 day) and 18 patients\nreceived placebo (mean age, 36.74 \u00b1 11.83 years; male, 56%; duration of symptoms,\n1.56 \u00b1 0.73 day). No patient exhibited the severe form of the disease (dengue\nhaemorrhagic fever) and/or shock (dengue shock syndrome) (Table). There was no significant difference between group\ncharacteristics (p > 0.05) and the most frequent symptoms were fever (100%), body\nache (99.2%), headache (96.8%), joint pain (70.4%) and retro-orbital pain (68%).\nThere was no significant difference in the duration of the disease or the intensity\nand days of fever among the dengue patients treated with either chloroquine or\nplacebo. However, 12 (63%) of the dengue patients reported a substantial reduction\nin the intensity of pain and a great improvement in their ability to perform daily\nchores after taking chloroquine, whereas no improvement was reported by the patients\ntaking placebo (p = 0.0004) (Table).\nHowever, as this finding was not observed in the patients with OFDs, which included\nbacterial pneumonia, urinary tract infection and influenza, these diseases were not\nincluded in the statistical evaluation because the primary goal of this study was to\nexamine the influence of chloroquine on the evolution of dengue disease.\nInterestingly, the symptoms returned immediately after the patients stopped taking\nthe three-day chloroquine treatment, showing that chloroquine's effect was most\nlikely due to the anti-inflammatory action of chloroquine rather than to its\nantiviral effect.\n\n\n\n\n\nSide effects were reported by only two patients and consisted of\ntransient blurred vision in one and a loss of consciousness in the other. The latter\npatient was severely dehydrated and seizure was ruled out based on clinical\npresentation and follow-up. Both patients were not confirmed to be dengue\npatients.\n\nChloroquine did not alter the duration of the disease or the intensity\nand days of fever compared to the dengue patients taking placebo. However, the\npatients taking chloroquine reported a substantial reduction in the intensity of\npain and a great improvement in their health status.\n\nDengue is a worldwide health problem that affects millions of people and\ncauses innumerable deaths, particularly in the tropical and subtropical areas of the\nworld. Controlling the viral vector is currently the only option for reducing dengue\ndisease rates, as there is no a vaccine or effective antiviral agent available for\nthe treatment of dengue infections. Accordingly, it is important to identify\ntreatment strategies that could reduce the burden of this disease (Valero & Levy 2008).\n\nChloroquine is a 9-aminoquinoline known since 1934 that has a long\nhistory of use as an antimalarial agent and as an alternative drug to treat a\nvariety of chronic diseases (Savarino et al.\n2003, Tutor-Ureta & Yebra-Bango\n2005). The rationales for using chloroquine in dengue patients include\nthe drug's anti-inflammatory property, possible antiviral effect, with action on\nflaviviruses, low cost, universal availability and safety and global public health\nimportance of dengue. Recently, a potential use of chloroquine has been described in\nsome viral infections, such as influenza, human immunodeficiency virus and severe\nacute respiratory syndrome (coronavirus) (Lanciotti\net al. 1992, Savarino et al. 2003,\n2006, Vincent et al. 2005, Adachi et al.\n2007, Di Trani et al. 2007, Keyaerts et\nal. 2009, Martinson et al. 2010).\n\nOne possible explanation for the antiviral effect of chloroquine could be\nrelated to the impairment of viral replication by raising the intracellular pH and\nthereby interfering with endosome-mediated viral entry. An increase in pH in acidic\norganelles, including endosomes, lysosomes and Golgi vesicles, leads to unwanted\nchanges in the post-translational modifications of newly synthesised proteins,\nparticularly the inhibition of glycosylation (Savarino et al. 2004, Rolain et al.\n2007). These effects are of particular importance in DENV infection\nbecause these viruses require endosomal acidification to release their viral RNA in\nthe cytoplasm to initiate viral replication (Lindenbach & Rice 2003). Other possible antiviral actions of\nchloroquine are based on either interference with the post-translational processing\nof viral glycoproteins, leading to imperfect glycosylation or to undefined\ninterference with the late stages of viral replication (Savarino et al. 2003, 2004). However, the exact mechanism of action of chloroquine has not\nbeen completely elucidated and differs depending on different pathogens (Rolain et al. 2007).\n\n\nTricou et al. (2010) evaluated the effect of\nchloroquine in hospitalised adult patients with dengue and found no difference in\nviraemia or NS1 antigenaemia duration and modest anti-pyretic activity for\nchloroquine in the intention-to-treat population, but not in dengue\nlaboratory-confirmed cases. Moreover, these researchers observed a trend toward a\nlower incidence of dengue haemorrhagic fever in dengue patients treated with\nchloroquine.\n\nIn our study, there was also no difference in the duration of disease or\ndays of fever in dengue patients taking either chloroquine or placebo. However, the\npatients taking chloroquine in addition to routine analgesic drugs had a substantial\nreduction in the intensity of pain and a great improvement in health status. The\npain amelioration observed in the enrolled patients taking chloroquine was not\nquantified by pain scales, which is a limitation of our study. However, we\nobjectively inquired about and evaluated the dengue-related symptoms, including\npain, in all patients during acute disease and one week later, at the time when the\npatients returned for a clinical evaluation during convalescence.\n\nWe hypothesised that the clinical benefit observed in dengue patients\ntreated with chloroquine could be due to the drug's anti-inflammatory effects,\nparticularly because chloroquine is a tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 inhibitor and\nsome of the clinical manifestations in dengue patients are due to high levels of\nserum TNF-\u03b1 (Hober et al. 1993, Pinto et al. 1999, Gandini et al. 2011). Another possible effect of chloroquine\nin dengue patients could be related to its antiviral action, lowering the viral load\nand thus the degree of immune system activation. Other studies with different\ntherapeutic doses, different durations and an earlier onset of treatment should be\nperformed to evaluate the in vivo effect of chloroquine on dengue infection.\nMoreover, it would be interesting to compare the effect of other anti-inflammatory\ncompounds on the treatment of dengue patients; however, non-steroidal drugs should\nbe avoided in the care of these patients.\n\nOne limitation of this study was the small number of patients treated\nwith chloroquine. Although only a small number of dengue patients were included in\nthe study, approximately 63% reported an improvement in their symptoms while on the\nmedication and the symptoms returned immediately after the patients stopped taking\nthe medication. This finding indicates that chloroquine is a possible candidate for\nuse in the treatment of dengue. In addition, the side effects of chloroquine\nobserved in this study were unremarkable.\n\nAlthough chloroquine has a narrow safety margin, it is usually well\ntolerated. Adverse effects, such as headache, nausea, malaise, dizziness, blurred\nvision, difficulty focusing, mild gastrointestinal upset and pruritus, may commonly\noccur. Severe toxicity, e.g., neuromyopathy, retinopathy and bone-marrow toxicity,\nis rare and may occur with long-term treatment and/or as an idiosyncratic reaction (\nTaylor & White 2004, Alkadi 2007). Chloroquine may worsen\npsoriasis, though is rarely associated with seizures and psychosis. Acute toxicity\nis most frequently found with therapeutic or high doses administered too rapidly by\nparenteral routes (AlKadi 2007). Toxic\neffects are related to the ingested dose and a single dose of 20 mg/kg is considered\ntoxic (Taylor & White 2004). In this\nstudy, a safety dose of 600 mg per day for three days was used in adults and the\nside effects were unremarkable. Furthermore, the chloroquine dosage used in this\nstudy is very similar to the dosage used for vivax malaria treatment and, in our\nexperience, side effects are rare with this treatment. However, considering the\nsmall number of patients, more studies are necessary to evaluate the safety of\nchloroquine in dengue patients.\n\nIn conclusion, chloroquine promoted a reduction in the intensity of pain\nand an improvement in the well-being of patients with dengue infection, but did not\nalter the duration of the disease or the intensity and days of fever. Therefore,\nconsidering that the current options for dengue treatment are very limited, we\nsuggest that chloroquine should be further tested in dengue disease with a larger\nnumber of patients and different chloroquine dosages and times of administration to\nconfirm the drug's clinical effect and to assess the side effects of chloroquine in\ndengue patients."}
