{"title": "Longitudinal characteristics of lymphocyte responses and cytokine profiles in the peripheral blood of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients", "body": "First reported in Wuhan, China, on 31 December 2019, an ongoing outbreak of a viral pneumonia in humans has raised acute and grave global concern. The causative pathogen was rapidly identified as a novel \u03b2 -coronavirus, which has since been formally named as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. According to the daily report of the National Health Commission of China, the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 has so far caused 57,416 confirmed cases, including 11,272 severe cases, and 1,665 deaths in China by February 15th, 2020 [1] show symptoms of fever, dry cough, fatigue, abnormal chest CT findings but with a good prognosis [2, 3] . In contrast, some patients develop severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organ failure, with death rates ranging from between 4.3% to 15% according to different study reports [2, 4] .\n\nLymphopenia and inflammatory cytokine storm are typical laboratory abnormalities observed during highly pathogenic coronavirus infections, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections, and are believed to be associated with disease severities [5, 6] . Recent studies have also reported decreases in the counts of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and increases in serum inflammatory cytokine\n\nA written informed consent was regularly obtained from all patients upon admission into Wuhan Union Hospital, China. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. The 40 confirmed COVID-19 patients at Wuhan Union Hospital during January 5 to January 24, 2020 were enrolled into this retrospective single-center study. All medical record information including epidemiological, demographic, clinical manifestation, laboratory data, and outcome data were obtained. All data were checked by a team of trained physicians.\n\nLaboratory confirmation of the SARS-CoV-2 was performed by local CDC according to Chinese CDC protocol. Throat-swab specimens were collected from all patients and the samples were maintained in viral-transport medium for laboratory testing. An infection with other respiratory viruses including influenza A virus, influenza B virus, Coxsackie virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus and enterovirus was excluded by real-time RT-PCR. Specimens, including sputum or alveolar lavatory fluid, blood, urine, and feces, were cultured to identify pathogenic bacteria or fungi that may be associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The specific IgG and IgM of Chlamydia pneumonia and Mycoplasma pneumonia were detected by chemiluminescence immunoassay. The lymphocyte test kit (Beckman Coulter Inc., FL, USA) was used for lymphocyte subset analysis. Plasma cytokines (IL2, IL4, IL6, IL10, TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 ) were detected with human Th1/2 cytokine kit II (BD Ltd., Franklin lakes, NJ, USA).

All severe patients and 85.2% of the mild patients had fever, while no significant difference in the degrees of temperature was observed between the two groups ( Table 1 ).

No significant differences in the serum levels of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG and IgM), complement C3 or C4 were observed between the two groups ( Table 2 ).\n\nLymphopenia was observed in 44.4% (12/27) of mild patients and 84.6% (11/13) of severe patients at the onset of the disease. As shown in Table 2 , the absolute counts of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of the severe patients was significantly lower, while the absolute counts of total white blood cells (WBCs) and neutrophils were significantly higher, than those of the mild patients at the time of hospital admission.\n\nNo significant difference in monocyte counts was observed between the two groups (Table 2 ). Next, we analyzed the kinetic changes of WBCs, neutrophils and monocytes as well as different lymphocyte subsets in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients from the disease onset to at least 16 days later. The two mortalities in the severe group were excluded from the analysis due to the lack of kinetic data. Significant increases in total WBCs counts in the severe group were only observed at the time point of onset (within 3 days) but not during the following period of disease progression compared to the mild group ( Figure 1A ). Significant increases in neutrophil counts of the severe group were observed not only at the time point of disease onset, but also at 13-15 days after compared to the mild group ( Figure 1B) . In contrast, a sustained decrease in lymphocyte counts of the severe group was observed All rights reserved.

The difference was significant at the time point of disease onset and became even greater on 4-6 days later ( Figure 1C ). From 7-15 days after disease onset, the lymphocyte counts gradually increased in the severe group, and reached a comparable level to that of the mild patients at 16 days after disease onset ( Figure 1C ). No significant differences in monocyte counts were observed between the two groups during the whole observation period ( Figure 1D ).\n\nIn order to further determine the kinetic changes of different lymphocyte subsets in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients, we performed flow cytometry to stain CD3 + T cells, CD4 + and CD8 + T cell subsets, B cells and NK cells. Similar to the findings for lymphocytes, sustained decreases in CD3, CD8 and CD4 T cell counts was observed in the severe group compared to those of the mild patients during clinical observation ( The differences in CD3 and CD8 T cell counts between the two groups were significant at the time points of disease onset and 7-9 days later (Figure 2A and 2C).\n\nHowever, the differences in CD4 T cell counts between the two groups did not reach a statistical significance at any time point ( Figure 2C ). The T cell counts started to gradually increase in the severe group starting at 7 days after disease onset, and reached comparable levels to those in the mild patients on day 16 after disease onset ( Figure 2A -C). No significant differences in B cell and NK cell counts were observed between the two groups during the whole course of the disease ( Figure 2D and 2E).\n\nA previous study demonstrated changes in inflammatory cytokine levels, such as IL-2, All rights reserved.

Therefore, we further characterized the kinetic changes of inflammatory cytokine levels, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, in the serum of our patient cohort. Fluctuations in the serum levels of these cytokines in the mild patient group were minor. In contrast, the severe patient group showed more significant fluctuations in the serum levels of these cytokines ( Figure 3 ). All examined cytokines, except IL-6, reached their peak levels in the serum at 3-6 days after disease onset ( Figure 3 ). Both IL-6 and IL-10 levels showed sustained increases in the severe group compared to the mild group ( Figure 3A and 3B) . A decease in serum IL-6 levels in the severe group started at 16 days after disease onset, and IL-10 levels were lowest at 13 days after disease onset ( Figure 3A and 3B). Significant increases in serum IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 levels in the severe group were only observed at 4-6 days after disease onset ( Figure 3C and 3F).\n\nNo significant differences in IL4 and TNF-\u03b1 levels were observed between the two groups during the whole course of the disease ( Figure 3D and 3E). All examined cytokines reached similar levels between the severe and mild patient groups at 16 days after disease onset ( Figure 3 ).\n\nNext, we examined the possibilities of using above-mentioned parameters as prognostic factors for identifying severe cases in COVID-19 patients. PCA was firstly performed by R package \"factoextra\" to identify correlated variables for distinguishing severe patients from mild patients ( Figure 4A ). Four mostly\n\nneutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), neutrophil counts (NEC) and White Blood Cells counts (WBCC) were selected as potential prognostic factors for further detailed statistical analysis. To assess the diagnostic value of these 4 selected parameters, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under ROC curve (AUC) were All rights reserved.

Although the majority of the patients did not have an exposure history of the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, the clinical characteristics of these patients are very similar to those reported in previous studies [2, 4, 7] . The ages of severe patients are older, and the proportion of underlying diseases is higher, and co-infection also occurs in severe patients. Recent reports show that the lymphocyte counts are normal in COVID-19 patients with mild diseases. In contrast, 63%-70.3% of patients with severe diseases have lymphopenia and the lymphocyte counts in patients with a mortal outcome remain at a low level [4, 8] . Our study also confirmed higher rates of developing lymphopenia in severe patients than in mild patients (84.6% vs 44.4%). We found that the development of lymphopenia in severe patients was mainly related to the significantly decreased absolute counts of T cells, especially CD8 + T cells, but not to B cells and NK cells. The decrease of T cells in the severe patient group reaches its peak within the first week during the disease course, and then T cell numbers gradually increase from the second week and recover to a comparable level to that of the mild patient group in the third week. All these severe patients included in our study survived the disease, and thus we speculate this course is associated with a favorable outcome in severe COVID-19 patients. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023671 doi: medRxiv preprint our results demonstrate that N8R has even better performance with a higher AUC value than NLR in the ROC curve analysis, and may serve as a more powerful factor than NLR for predicting the severe illness incidence in COVID patients.\n\nIn summary, our study of immunological characteristics of the peripheral blood in COVID-19 patients shows that the numbers of neutrophils and T cells, especially CD8 + T cells, as well as the levels of inflammatory cytokines in the peripheral blood is dynamically correlated with the severity of the disease. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to describe the kinetic changes of lymphocyte subsets and cytokine profiles in COVID-19 patients. Importantly, we identified N8R and NLR as powerful prognostic factors for early identification of severe COVID-19 cases.\n\nThis work may help to achieve a better understanding of immune function disorder as well as immunopathogenesis during SARS-CoV-2 infection.
