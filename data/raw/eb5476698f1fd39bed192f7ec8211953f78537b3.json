{"title": "SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Alu RNA regulates the cellular pool of active ribosomes by targeted delivery of SRP9/14 to 40S subunits", "body": "The pDLscAlu construct for scAluY NF1 RNA expression in cell lines was obtained by removing the neo Tet reporter gene, Alu right arm and the internal A-rich linker from Alu-neo Tet plasmid (5). The pDLscAluG25C construct was derived from pDLscAlu using the quick change protocol. Vector control plasmid pDL7enh was generated by digestion of pDLscAlu plasmid at EagI/EcoRI sites to remove the scAluY NF1 RNA coding sequence, followed by treatment with DNA Polymerase I, Large (Klenow) Fragment (Promega, Madison, WI) and ligation with T4 DNA ligase (Promega). Constructs for in vivo expression of 4.5S RNA and 7SL RNA were obtained by digestion of pDLscAlu with EagI and SpeI and insertion of the PCR fragment amplified from pS4.5S and p7Sswt (1), respectively.\n\nRun-off in vitro transcription reactions were performed as described in (6,7). For DraI, respectively. SA110, SA151 and SA86 RNAs were synthesized in the same way from plasmids pSAlu110, pSA151 and pSA86 linearized with XbaI. Non-coding RNAs were purified on a preparative denaturing polyacrylamide gel as described (11) .\n\nExpression and purification of recombinant translation initiation factors eIF1, 1A, 4A, 4B, 4G, 5B, 5 and Escherichia coli Met-tRNA synthetase and purification of eIF2, eIF3, eEF1H, eEF2, 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits was performed as described in (3). Expression and purification of the recombinant eIF4GI 738-1116 was done as described in (12). Human recombinant SRP9 and SRP14 proteins and their mutated forms were obtained as described previously (2) with minor modifications in purification procedure. Lysates of SRP9-and SRP14-overexpressing BL21pLysS cells were combined and SRP9/14 was purified by heparin-sepharose affinity chromatography, the eluted protein was dialysed against 50 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 300 mM potassium acetate, 1 mM EDTA, 0.01% Nikkol, 10 mM DTT and further purified by ion-exchange chromatography on cation exchanger (MonoS 5/50 GL, GE Healthcare). Fractions containing SRP9/14 were pooled and dialysed against 20 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 500 mM potassium acetate, 0.01% Nikkol, 10 mM DTT, 10% glycerol.\n\nAlu RNPs were assembled in the buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, 500 mM potassium acetate, 5 mM magnesium acetate, 0.1% Nikkol and 4 mM DTT and purified on Superdex 200 column as described in (11). High salt concentration was used to ensure a 1:1 stoichiometry and to avoid nonspecific binding of an additional molecule(s) of SRP9/14 to Alu RNA. Resulting RNPs were then dialyzed against buffer (20 mM HEPES, 150 mM potassium acetate, 1.5 mM magnesium acetate, 0.01% Nikkol, 4 mM DTT and 10% glycerol). The concentrations of the RNPs were determined based on the optical absorption of the RNA at 260 nm and were confirmed electrophoretically by comparing the RNA and protein contents of the RNPs to equal amounts of RNA and protein alone. All RNPs were examined for RNA integrity by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the formation of the stoichiometric complexes with h9/14 was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-h14 antibodies. \n\nBinding assays were performed in 30 \u00b5l by combining 3 pmols of purified ribosomal subunits or 43S complex with 3 pmols of scAluY A /SA110 RNP or h9/14 in the binding buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM potassium acetate, 1.5 mM magnesium acetate, 2 mM DTT, 0.01% Nikkol. The mixtures were incubated for 10 min. at 37\u00b0C, adjusted to 100 \u00b5l and centrifuged through 5-20% sucrose gradient containing 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM potassium acetate, 5 mM magnesium acetate, 2 mM DTT at 60000 rpm for 2 hours at 4\u00b0C in a Beckman SW60 rotor. To reassemble 80S ribosomes from high-salt purified 40S and 60S the subunits were incubated in equimolar amounts for 10 min. at 37\u00b0C in buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM potassium acetate, 1.5 mM magnesium acetate, 4 mM DTT.\n\nThen equimolar amount of scAuY A RNP or h9/14 was added and reaction was incubated for another 10 min. in the binding buffer before centrifugation through 10-30% sucrose gradients at 40000 rpm for 5 hours in a Beckmann SW41 rotor.\n\nFractions were analyzed for the presence of h14 and S15 or L9 by Western blotting and for scAlu or SA110 RNA by Northern blotting.\n\nHEK293T cells were cultivated in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2mM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin.\n\nHEK 293T cells were incubated 10 min. with 100 \u00b5g/ml cycloheximide and lysed in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 15 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM potassium acetate, 0.5% NP-40, 2 mM DTT, 100 \u00b5g/ml cycloheximide, spun at 10000 x g for 5 min. and loaded on 7-50% linear sucrose gradients (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM potassium acetate, 12 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM DTT) and centrifuged at 35000 rpm in a SW41 rotor for 3.5\n\nhours. Following centrifugation gradients were displaced with 60% sucrose solution through a flow cell recording absorbance at 254 nM.\n\nTotal cellular RNA was extracted using Two-fold molar excess of h914 (A) or scAlu Y A RNP (B) was incubated with 3 pmols of high-salt purified 40S for 10 min. at 37\u02daC and fractionated on 5-20% sucrose gradients. 40S-containing fractions were determined by probing for S15.
