After China, Italy has been heavily affected and severe measures to limit the spread have been taken in the last weeks.\n\nRadiation Oncology departments must guarantee optimal cancer treatments even in such a challenging scenario of an ongoing aggressive epidemic.\n\nAdopted preventive measures and recommendations are highlighted for patients, professionals and clinical operations to minimize the risk of infection while safely treating cancer patients.\n\nFrom the first days of 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has been the main topic discussed all over the world.\n\nStarting from Wuhan, China, its diffusion has been facilitated from the continuous migration of people both for travelling and working purposes. The related disease, COVID-19, has been designated as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by WHO on 30 th January 2020, up to be considered as a pandemic on 11 th March 2020. Epidemiological data published so far in China suggest an increased risk for onco-hematological patients to contract the virus and face severe consequences from SARS-CoV-2 infection with a higher need of intensive care and a higher mortality, posing the question of the risk-benefit of potentially immunosuppressive cancer treatments, especially in elderly or in case of adjuvant therapies [1] .\n\nThe main measure to limit the SARS-CoV-2 diffusion is the quarantine: people are forced to stay at home to prevent its spreading. China, as first, adopted these measures at the end of January.\n\nOn the 31 st January 2020, Italy meets SARS-CoV-2. A Chinese couple from Wuhan is hospitalized in Rome during their trip due to malaise and high fever. The positive tests alarmed the whole country and a series of precautionary measures were taken: identification of people who were in contact with the couple, cancelation of direct flights to/from China, airlift of the Italians in Wuhan back to Italy with a mandatory 14-day quarantine, temperature screening for passengers arriving at any Italian airport, 14-day self-isolation for people with symptoms or at-risk.\n\nOn the 20 th February 2020, Patient 1 was identified in Codogno, near Milan, Lombardy: he was the first Italian affected by SARS-CoV-2. Lombardy is still the principal cluster of the disease. He was involuntarily responsible of the first diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy, considering his active social life and its hospitalization for \"malaise\" erroneously considered as simple influenza. The patient has been treated by health professionals with no adequate protective devices. This was the beginning of the spread of affected patients, resulting in the presence of a second cluster in Veneto: the first \"red zone\" was created.\n\nThe \"red zone\" included 11 towns in these two regions, people living here had to stay at home and were not allowed to leave or to enter the area, public transportation was blocked, and only necessities shops were open.\n\nNearby, a moderate-risk \"yellow area\" was established by the mandatory closure of schools/universities and some public areas and by the strong suggestion of following some general rules: 1-m safety distance between customers in shops and restaurants, events and ceremonies were cancelled, all the shopping centres had to close during the weekends.\n\nStarting from the initial shutdown of universities and social/working life restrictions, a massive migration of people from the North to the South of Italy has potentially contributed to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the southern regions.\n\nOn the 8 th March 2020, all northern Italy became a \"red zone\" with the same restrictions applied previously. The day after, the lockdown was extended to all the regions of Italy, affecting around 60 million people.\n\nSpecial recommendations for oncological patients were published on 10 th March: avoidance of crowded places, wearing of a surgical mask out in public spaces, need of careful hand hygiene and the restriction for visits from relatives and friends were all requested [1] [2] [3] .\n\nThe government indication for the hospitals concerning cancer patients was to postpone follow-up visits, whenever possible, and to establish pathways and spaces dedicated to oncological patients.\n\nThe Italian government has created a website to keep track of the SARS-CoV-2 spread and its realtime statistics [4] .\n\nThe University Hospital \"Maggiore della Carit\u00e0\" of Novara, is in the Piedmont Region in the northwest of Italy and about 40 Km from Milan. It is a general hospital hosting about 700 inpatients, and it is the hub of the northeast of the region covering an area with 1 million inhabitants.\n\nThe Radiation Oncology department is split on two nearby hospitals, 20 Km apart. We treat an average of 120 patients on four linear accelerators and we perform about 10 first visits every day. In addition, the medical and nursing staff manages four hospital beds for inpatients who require special support for concomitant chemo-radiation and management of treatment toxicity.\n\nStarting from February 24 th , some access restrictions to our department have been established.\n\nPatient with respiratory symptoms (fever, cough, conjunctivitis, rhinitis) were not admitted and invited to contact their general practitioner or the emergency number set up by the Health Ministry.\n\nCaregivers were not admitted to the department to reduce the access of people, unless for not selfsufficient patients. No limitations were placed on the routine activities of the department of Radiation Oncology.\n\nWith the increase of the spread of the infections and the establishment of the \"red zone\" on the 8 th March, new measures have been adopted, such as the opening of just one access gate to the University Hospital. In this entrance, a first triage was performed to patients by the measurement of the temperature and evaluation of symptoms (cough, dyspnea). Above 37.5 \u00b0C and presence of symptoms patients were addressed to further investigations.\n\nAt the department entrance, patients were asked to fill in a special medical history form; the form required to declare respiratory symptoms and contacts with people with suspected or confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in the last 14 days. In case of affirmative answer to one of the above items, a surgical mask was provided. Each patient was invited to wash his hands with alcohol-based products and use a surgical mask.\n\nA specific bracelet with the date of the day was given to each patient after triage. In the waiting rooms the chairs have been spaced apart to keep at least one meter of distance between one patient and another. \n\nThis is the first time that an infection epidemic in the last decades has spread worldwide with such aggressiveness representing nowadays a real emergency for the whole population. The health system including the main hospitals is facing the epidemic with only few effective weapons.\n\nRadiotherapy departments are potentially exposed as the others to epidemic and this aspect represents a crucial issue since most oncologic patients have various degrees of immunodeficiency and are in the elderly, which is an additional risk factor. On the other hand, cancer patients cannot interrupt treatments and the whole staff of a radiotherapy department is asked to guarantee efficiency and safety for radiation treatments. Over the last few weeks, all professionals have worked in stressing conditions along a learning curve which is still ongoing. However, a few issues can be already pointed out as lesson learned:\n\n\u2022 Adoption of strict rules from the very beginning in case of infectious emergency;\n\n\u2022 General rules such as 1 m distance, no handshake or other contacts and washing hands frequently;\n\n\u2022 Special attention to room and equipment disinfection;\n\n\u2022 Adoption of surgical masks for patients and for professionals approaching cancer patients;\n\n\u2022 Maintenance of adequate warehouse stocks of masks, sheets, gloves, alcoholic cleaning solutions and disposable devices (shortage of these materials can become a problem); \u2022 Complete and regular information to patients and professionals;\n\n\u2022 Flexibility in case other units need support (warehouse, personnel);\n\n\u2022 Importance to share experiences among centers.\n\nTo envisage recommendations is not an easy task when the development of the epidemic is still ongoing and the effectiveness of some of our preventive measures is still under discussion.\n\nHowever, a few measures aiming at reducing the impact of epidemic can be highlighted:\n\n\u2022 Establishment of a coordination unit with representative of all professionals at Hospital and Department levels;\n\n\u2022 Unique source for communication to have clear and timely information and avoid redundancy and contrasting messages; \u2022 General rules for prevention and personal behavior with detailed information to all professionals from the very beginning (procedures for disinfection of rooms and machines, optimize pathways and waiting rooms strictly for patients; precise time for consultation avoiding unnecessary waiting time, washing hands frequently, surgical mask for operators and for patients/accompanying persons); \u2022 Review of organizational procedures: postponement of treatments for low-priority cases (prostate with hormone, benign diseases, etc.), favor short-term Tx (hypofractionation), skip F/U visits (use phone contacts) \u2022 Definition of a priori policy for coronavirus suspected or positive at the beginning and during treatment (recommended not to start Tx and recommended to interrupt Tx); \u2022 Triage procedure at the entrance of the department for all patients and accompanying persons: first access -questionnaire, temperature measurement, check of symptoms; daily treatment -temperature measurement, check of symptoms;\n\n\u2022 Check warehouse stocks for masks, coats, gloves, alcoholic cleaning solutions and disposable devices; \u2022 Plan for transportation of patients who could not be supported by family or volunteers;\n\n\u2022 Organization of psychological support for patient families and professionals.\n\nWe need more time to understand the most appropriate behavior for preventing infection while treating our patients. Data collection and large collaboration among centers worldwide are needed to understand the real impact of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic on population of cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. On the other hand, this epidemic has an impact also on professionals not only in terms of risk of infection but also in terms of psychological stress. These aspects should be considered carefully if we would like to maintain a good level of assistance for our patients."}
