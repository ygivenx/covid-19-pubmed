{"title": "", "body": "Astrovirus particles were first observed in the diarrheic feces of children (reviewed by Madeley, 1979) . Astroviruses are small round virus particles 28-30 nm in diameter, with a round unbroken edge and a characteristic sixpointed star with a white center and surface hollows that are triangular. Intestinal astrovirus infections were subsequently reported in lambs (Snodgrass and Gray, 1977) , in calves (Woode and Bridger, 1978) , in piglets (Bridger, 1980) , in turkeys (McNulty et al., 1980) , in red deer (Tzipori et al., 1981) and hepatitis of ducklings (Gough et al., 1984) .\n\nBovine, human and red deer astroviruses infect primary kidney cell cultures, infected cells being identified by IF test (Woode and Bridger, 1978; Woode et al., 1984) . The addition of trypsin to the media permitted the adaptation of human and bovine astroviruses to cell culture (Lee and Kurtz, 1981; Aroonprasert et al., 1989) . The morphology of each astrovirus isolate is similar (Fig. 173) . Herring et al. (1981) reported on the purification and characterization from gut contents of ovine astrovirus. The virus has a density in CsCl 2 of 1.35-1.37 g/ ml and a single-stranded RNA genome with an S value of 34 and a poly (A) tract. There are two major capsid polypeptides with a similar mol. wt. of approximately 3.3 \u03c7 10 4 . They conclude that astroviruses must be considered a separate group with a polypeptide composition intermediate between the Picornaviridae and Caliciviridae. In contrast, the human astrovirus has four polypeptides, suggesting a classification in the Picornaviridae. It is stable at pH 3 and in chloroform (Kurtz and Lee, 1987; Aroonprasert et al., 1989) .\n\nAstroviruses isolated from children, calves, lambs, piglets and red deer do not share common IF antigens (Lee and Kurtz, 1977; Woode and Bridger, 1978; Snodgrass et al., 1979; Bridger, 1980; Tzipori et al., 1981) . The recent isolates of bovine astrovirus in the USA share IF antigens and cross-react with antiserum to the UK astrovirus isolated by Woode and Bridger (1978) (Fig. 174) . However, the two USA isolates and the UK isolate do not share neutralizing antigens, which suggests that there are at least three serotypes (Woode et al., 1985) . At least four serotypes of human astrovirus exist (Kurtz and Lee, 1984) . \n\nAstroviruses have been isolated from diarrheic calves in association with calicivirus-like agent, Coronavirus and rotavirus in England (Woode and Bridger, 1978; Bridger et al., 1984) and with rotavirus, Coronavirus and Cryptosporidium in the USA (Woode et al., 1984 (Woode et al., ,1985 . In the opinion of these authors astrovirus does not cause a clinical syndrome in calves, and for this reason the virus has not been studied extensively. However, studies in the USA have shown that although gnotobiotic calves infected with astrovirus do not develop clinical illness, cytopathic changes are observed in the dome epithelium of the Peyer's patches (Woode et al., 1984 (Woode et al., , 1985 . Experimentally, infection is transmissible by the fecal-oral route. Virus infectivity persists several years at 4\u00b0C in fecal contents and at least 6 months as a 25% suspension of feces in phosphate buffered saline. Serological surveys for bovine astrovirus infection in the UK and USA reported 27% and 31% of sera, respectively, to be antibody positive (Woode and Bridger, 1978; Woode et al., 1984 Woode et al., , 1985 . In the USA 28 of 1060 (2.6%) calf diarrhea samples were positive for astrovirus. The low rate of isolation may reflect the subclinical nature of most infections, with isolation being a matter of chance.\n\nVirus enters by the oral route and is excreted in the feces 24-72 h p.i. Studies with two different bovine astrovirus serotypes reported infection in the M cells of the dome epithelium in the Peyer's patch area of the ileum, by IF and by observation of virions in degenerating epithelium by transmission EM (Woode et al., 1984 (Woode et al., , 1985 . Subsequent studies showed astrovirus infection in dome epithelium throughout the small intestine. Animals usually excrete virus for at least 5-7 days and some remain infected and excrete virus in feces for at least 3 weeks p.i.\n\nNo clinical signs directly attributable to astrovirus infection have been reported.\n\nThere is one study reported on the pathology (Woode et al., 1984) . Only the epithelium overlying the domes of the Peyer's patches in the ileum region is involved. Most of the M cells of the dome epithelium are positive in immunofluorescence for astrovirus antigen. The tips of most domes are covered by cell debris containing swollen and degenerated epithelial cells, mononuclear cells and eosinophilic cells. Other domes are covered by flat to cuboidal epithelium. The Peyer's patches associated with infected domes show central cellular depletion and contain large cells with dark nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Ultrastructurally the virus is observed in both M cells and enteroabsorptive cells of the dome epithelium; its mean diameter is 30 nm.\n\nCalves develop serum antibodies to astrovirus which can be demonstrated by IF and neutralization tests and by IEM.\n\nBecause of the small size and few particles produced, diagnosis by EM is difficult. Only primary calf kidney cell cultures can be infected by the virus, and immunofluorescent cells are demonstrable 24 h p.i. This method can be used for serology, both immunofluorescence and neutralization, and for titrating excreted virus (Woode et al., 1985) . Calves excrete up to 10 5 -10 7 infectious units per gram of feces for several days.\n\nNo methods of control of infection have been reported. The resistance of the virus enhances its ability to persist in the cattle population.\n\nAstrovirus infections in lambs have been studied by only one group, in Scotland. Data on geographical distribution of the virus are lacking, and nothing is known on the role of reservoir hosts, persistence in animals or how the virus spreads. It probably persists in the sheep population by virtue of its resistance to environmental factors when in feces and possibly by reinfection of the adult population. The virus was isolated from 8 to 17 lambs and probably spread by the fecal-oral route. Experimentally there is an incubation period of 2-3 days before virus is excreted in the feces, and this coincides approximately with the onset of diarrhea or softening of the feces (Snodgrass and Gray, 1977) .\n\nUnder experimental conditions the fecal-oral route of infection occurs. Virus has been detected only in the epithelial cells of the small intestine (Snodgrass et al., 1979) . The virus is excreted for at least 9 days p.i. (Snodgrass and Gray, 1977) .\n\nExperimental infections of 2-day-old gnotobiotic lambs cause mild diarrhea after an incubation period of 48 h; recovery occurs within 4-5 days (Snodgrass et al., 1979) .\n\nAstrovirus infection is observed by IF test in the mature villus epithelial cells and in subepithelial macrophages of the small intestine (Snodgrass et al., 1979) . Infected cells are scattered irregularly in the apical 50% of the villi and are best observed in lambs killed early p.i. These cells are cuboidal in appearance and virus-containing inclusion bodies may be seen in the cytoplasm.\n\nPartial villus atrophy occurs at 38-45 hours p.i. in the midgut region and at 38-120 hours p.i. in the ileum. There is crypt hyperplasia in the anterior, mid and distal small intestine. The effects are most marked in the ileum. The lactase levels in the tissues are consistently reduced in the midgut region but not in the proximal or distal tissues. Complete healing may occur within 5 days of infection.\n\nUltrastructural studies show crystalline arrays of virus particles, 29 nm, in the cytoplasm; virus particles are also observed in apical pits, in tubules and in secondary lysosomes. Virus particles may be seen aligning along microvilli, and sloughing cells show degenerate microvilli (Gray et al., 1980) . Convalescent sera contain antibodies demonstrable by IF test and specific for lamb astrovirus.\n\nThe diagnostic method of choice is EM. The fecal contents are diluted to 20% in distilled water, the suspension allowed to settle and a drop stained with 1% potassium phosphotungstate pH 7.0.\n\nThere is one report of the infection (Tzipori et al., 1981) . The virus was observed in the feces of artificially reared red deer fawns suffering from diarrhea attributable to cryptosporidial infection. Particles with the typical morphology of astrovirus were seen (28-30 nm in diameter). Convalescent sera reacted in IF tests with infected cells in culture, but not with tissues infected with lamb rotavirus. The role of astrovirus in the outbreak of diarrhea is uncertain and there is no evidence available concerning its pathogenicity.\n\nLittle is known of the importance of astroviruses in causing diarrhea in humans and animals. Lamb astrovirus causes widespread lesions in enterocytes, but frequency of infection in lambs has not been studied. There is doubt about their role in humans (Bishop, 1982) . In calves, although they do not produce diarrhea, the dome epithelial lesion may affect the gut local immune response and the ability of the animal to control other enteric infections. These viruses are probably widespread in nature, with perhaps each animal species possessing a population unrelated antigenically to astroviruses of other species, and different serotypes being common for each species. Whether the various astroviruses belong to one family of viruses is yet to be determined, as they are only related in their morphology."}
