{"title": "8 Control of intestinal diseases by dietary supplementation with antibodies", "body": "The surface of the mucosal membranes exceeds by a hundred times that of the skin. It is at the mucosal membrane of the gastrointestinal tract that massive contact with the external environment occurs. Colonization of the host's tissue by bacteria begins by the binding of bacterial surface adhesins with appropriate ligands on the host's cells (Soto and Hultgren, 1999) . Further stages involve breaking through the host's defense, proliferation and damage of the host's tissues (Kaper et al., 2004) . Effective protection against potential infections via this route is a considerable challenge for the organism. The digestive tract protection system consists of natural barriers (epithelial continuity, mucus secretion, peristaltic motility, low pH of gastric juice, etc.); nonspecific humoral immunity factors (complement, lysozyme, defensins, etc.) ; nonspecific cellular immunity factors (macrophages, granulocytes, dendritic cells); specific humoral immunity (antibodies) and specific cellular immunity factors (T and B lymphocytes).\n\nThe efficiency of the immune system in the healthy animal depends on the cooperation of all the mechanisms mentioned above (Mueller et al., 1983; Sheldrake and Husband, 1985; Riedel-Caspari and Schmidt, 1991; Honorio-Franca et al., 1997) .\n\nStatistics concerning the occurrence of gastrointestinal tract pathology in young animals indicate that this age group is more often prone to the failure of organ protection systems. On the day of birth no specific immune cells are found in the neonate's digestive tract. The colonization of the mucosal membrane lymphatic structures by lymphocytes takes place gradually. The first immune cells in the intestine are identified after 1-2 weeks of life (Navarro et al., 1997; Aminova et al., 2000) and their concentration comparable with that of adult animals is not achieved until after a few months of life. Until then the effectiveness of its self-active, specific, humoral and cellular immunity should be regarded as insufficient. The most important role is played by self-secretory IgA, the main mucosal immunoglobulin (Ig), of which a protective level is not achieved until after 2-4 weeks of life (Mestecky et al., 1991; Macpherson et al., 2001) . However, the nonspecific immune mechanisms are efficient, although their activity may be slightly lower than that of adult animals (Mueller et al., 1983) .\n\nThe observations mentioned above indicate that maintaining the gastrointestinal tract homeostasis in the first weeks of life depends to a large extent on the passive protection from maternal immunity (Stefaniak, 2000) . Early drinking of colostrum provides supplemental antibodies for the gastrointestinal tract (Mellor and Murray, 1986) . Due to the protection provided by maternal antibodies the microorganisms entering the neonate's digestive tract (Korhonen et al., 1995; Palmeira et al., 2001) have limited success in attacking the mucosal membrane ( fig.1 ).\n\nOther colostral components, such as immunomodulating and/or antimicrobial substances, including lactoferrin, lysozyme, lactoperoxidase and cytokines (Wagstrom et al., 2000; He et al., 2001; Blum and Baumrucker, 2002; Solomon, 2002) also have considerable significance for protection of the newborn. Furthermore, colostral components can also contribute to the cellular immunity, e.g. significant numbers of maternal cells may contribute to neonatal immunity, including phagocytes (neutrophils and macrophages), lymphocytes (B and T cells) and epithelial cells (Wagstrom et al., 2000) . An interesting natural protective colostral mechanism is provided by the presence of soluble receptor analogs, which block the microbial adhesins and other pathogenic factors (Lindahl, 1989; Kelly and Younson, 2000) . An example of this is the binding of F41 and K99 fimbrias of enterotoxigenic strains of Escherichia coli by glycoproteins present in cow and sow colostrum, and due to which pathogene adherence to intestinal epithelium of a neonate becomes weakened (Lindahl, 1989) .\n\nHowever, the most important protective role is played by specific antibodies against antigens present in the neonate's environment (Riedel-Caspari, 1993; Korhonen et al., 2000b; Le Rousic et al., 2000; Crouch et al., 2001; Pisarska et al., 2002) . Maternal antibodies, obtained from the colostrum and milk, protect the neonate against infections until its own efficient specific immune protection is developed (figs. 2 and 3).\n\nA cow should produce at least 2 L of the first colostrum, containing at least 5% of Ig (50 g/L), which equals about 100 g per calf (Kruse, 1970; Tyler et al., 1999) . In the study by Kruse (1970) 12% of cows did not give 2 L of colostrum and 30% showed an IgG concentration below 50 g/L. Similar data, obtained by Levieux and Ollier (1999) , point to the fact that calves originating from primiparous cows are endangered by insufficient passive protection. Immunoglobulin concentrations in secretions of the ruminant mammary gland decrease rapidly after parturition and for instance in cow milk remain below 2 g/L at the 8th milking and below 1 g/L after the 15th milking (Levieux and Ollier, 1999 Fig. 1 . Protection of the gut by specific antibodies. (a) Pathogenic factor attacking the unprotected mucosal membrane; (b) Protection due to early feeding with the immune colostrum, and/or prophylactic oral immunoglobulin supplementation. High concentration of antibodies protects the mucosal membrane.\n\n= IgG antibodies (from colostrum or oral immunoglobulin supplementation); = SIgA antibodies (originating from colostrum or produced locally in low quantities within the gut of the young animal); = specific receptor (to bacterial adhesins, toxins, viruses, etc.); = pathogenic factor (bacterial, viral, toxic).\n\nspecific antibodies, or their inadequacy towards environmental microbes, facilitate early colonization of the neonate's digestive tract as well as its susceptibility to diseases ( fig. 4 ). It is believed that the main role of the cellular components in mammary secretions is to interact with the development of local immunity in the newborn and to modulate active immunization of the neonatal intestine during this critical period, which is especially important to the development of the young (Le Jan, 1996; Barrington and Parish, 2001) .\n\nIn today's production practices, about 20-40% of newborns of large farm animals (cattle, swine, horses, goats, sheep) develop failure of passive transfer (FPT) (Halawa and Stefaniak, 2000) . FPT means the acquired humoral specific immune deficiency of the neonate due to insufficient absorption of maternal, colostral immunoglobulins ( fig. 5 ). A direct consequence of this is an increased susceptibility to diseases in the first weeks of life. Calves exhibiting inadequate IgG concentrations are at greater risk of neonatal morbidity and preweaning mortality (McGuire et al., 1976; Vermunt, 1994; Wittum and Perino, 1995; Rea et al., 1996; Tyler et al., 1999) , which necessitates the wide use of antibiotics. Because of the increasing antibiotic-resistance of bacterial strains, the common use of antibiotics, to protect the young animals against diarrhea, is becoming less and less effective. This is accompanied by raised consumer awareness of safe food (antibiotic-free) and the revised definition of safe food . Its new understanding points to food derived from animals kept in welfare conditions, without any antibiotic treatment throughout their life. This is another reason for withdrawing antibiotics and searching for alternatives (Kelly and Younson, 2000; Mine and Kovacs-Nolan, 2002) .\n\nLack of self-antibodies The binding of microbial adhesins to host receptor molecules is a critical early step in microbial infection and pathogenesis. Bacterial toxins also require at the first stage to bind with a specific ligand (Girardeau and Bertin, 1995) . Exemplary well-recognized adhesins, bacterial enterotoxins and their appropriate ligands are presented in table 1.\n\nTherefore, the possibility of blocking this interaction seems to be an attractive means of preventing infection at the early stage. Oral application of anti-adhesin antibodies is the most commonly used strategy of adhesion-blocking, but alternative aids are under investigation, especially adhesin analogues and receptor analogues (Kelly and Younson, 2000) .\n\nOrally administered specific antibodies against enteropathogenic viruses block the development of diarrhea resulting from infections with rota-and coronaviruses (Besser et al., 1988; Snodgrass et al., 1990; Heckert et al., 1999; Erhard et al., 1993; Ikemori et al., 1997) .\n\nThere are two main periods of the highest risk of diarrhea (Frank and Kaneene, 1992; Vermunt, 1994; Sivula et al., 1996; Yokoyama et al., 1998) , which require local immunity supplementation: 1. the neonatal period (age 0-14 days): the main risk factors are enterotoxigenic E. coli and rotavirus infection 2. postweaning period: associated with stress, changes in the feeding programme; the highest risk is during the first 2 weeks in the new environment. Therefore, research into the wide application of immunoglobulins for the prophylaxis of animal gastrointestinal tract diseases ensues from ascertaining that the methods of health protection applied so far, based on massive antibiotic administration, have not been efficient enough and have caused numerous side effects. In contrast, the high efficiency of prophylactic and therapeutic oral application of antibodies is indicated in fig. 4 .\n\nOne of the methods of treatment of acquired immune deficiency in young animals is oral application of immunoglobulin preparations containing antibodies directed against the incriminated digestive tract pathogens (Bogsted et al., 1996; Barrington et al., 2002) . The most important sources of antibodies used in the protection of the alimentary tract of newborn farm animals are air-dried cow colostrum, egg yolk immunoglobulin and swine serum (Haines et al., 1990; Facon et al., 1993; LeRousic et al., 2000; Shibata et al., 2001; DeRouchey et al., 2003; Owusu-Asiedu et al., 2003a, b; Stefaniak et al., 2003) . The choice of antibody source and its purification method need to be made in consideration of the circumstances of use, target animals, specificity, costs, quantity needed (table 2a and b) .\n\nAllogenic antibodies cooperate with other host-specific immune mechanisms. Their main positive effect is the rapid elimination of pathogenic agents, but on the other hand, they can induce unintended tissue injury due to complement activation at the mucosal membrane (bystander effect). Bovine colostrum purified IgG was absorbed from calf neonatal intestine more effectively than native colostral immunoglobulins, air-dried colostral immunoglobulins or swine serum immunoglobulins given in similar concentrations (Arthington et al., 2000a, b) . Absorbed allogenic immunoglobulins do not induce an immune response due to the intraspecies antigenic similarity. Passively acquired colostral IgG 1 anti-bovine rotavirus diffuse from blood to gut mucosal membranes up to the 10th day of calf life (Besser et al., 1988) , but in the case of intensive infections such antibodies are insufficient to protect the gastrointestinal tract against diarrhea. However, oral supplementation of calves with bovine colostral immunoglobulin concentrate resulted in higher serum immunoglobulin concentration within the first 4 weeks of life and additionally improved the weight gain and diminished the incidence of diarrhea (Nousiainen et al., 1994) .\n\nThis kind of antibody could well merit common usage to protect the young animals. Important information about application of xenogenic antibodies is: 1. When administered during the period of Ig absorption from the gut to bloodstream (e.g. in foals before the 24th hour of life, in calves before 27-30th hour and in piglets, lambs and goat kids before 36-48th hour) xenogenic proteins appear in the blood of recipient animals -they stimulate the immune response against foreign epitopes present on the given immunoglobulins. In consequence, it leads to fast Ig elimination (removal of immune complexes) during 2-4 weeks after ingestion, although their absorption is not as effective as that of allogenic Ig (Stefaniak, 2002; Ga sowska and Stefaniak, 2003) .\n\nIn contrast, no absorption occurs and no such risks are observed in older animals (usually after 48 hours of life). 2. The lack of, or occurrence of less intensive interactions with the cooperating immune mechanisms, may be advantageous in the protection of a healthy gastrointestinal tract. Binding the specific antibodies to the pathogen ( fig. 1 ) prevents interaction of the microbe with the mucosal membrane followed by immune exclusion (removal with the feces).\n\nPractically, air-drying of egg yolk immunoglobulin, cow colostrum or swine serum is the only method, which allows large-scale production at low cost. Heat treatment reduces microbiological contamination of the final products, and allows their long-term storage. However, the most important disadvantage of air drying is the loss of antibody activity, which can reach over 50% (Stefaniak, 2002) . The greatest denaturation and aggregation of cow immunoglobulins under the influence of temperature occur at pHs close to their isoelectric points (Lindstr\u00f6m et al., 1994; Dominguez et al., 2001) . The sensitivity of immunoglobulins to heat and their tendency to aggregation increase when there are low concentrations of salt in the solution. Although heat treatment (air-drying, pasteurization, UHT) causes a considerable decrease in the activity of specific antibodies (Korhonen et al., 2000a; Stefaniak, 2002) , they still maintain restricted activity for months during their storage. Lyophilized antibodies preserve over 90% of their activity during 1 year storage (Stefaniak and Kope\u0107, 1997; Stefaniak, 2002 , Stefaniak et al., 2004 and although they were also orally applied to young animals, relatively high costs and the low efficiency of freeze-drying has resulted in the abandonment of this method. Egg yolk antibody from vaccinated laying hens seems to be a cheaper and good source of antibody (Jin et al., 1998) . Simultaneous addition of spray-dried porcine plasma and egg yolk antibody to the fodder of early-weaned piglets appears to be an interesting idea (Owusu-Asiedu et al., 2003a) .\n\nThe main immunoglobulin class in mentioned antibody sources is IgG. A comparison of the IgG of cattle, swine and hens is presented in table 3. \n\nCow colostrum is the only kind of colostrum used on a large scale, due to the large volume secreted and even some \"overproduction\" (Klobasa et al., 1991) . Cow milk and colostrum are *assumption that the source of bovine immunoglobulin is colostrum, for swine -porker's blood serum, for hens -the eggs of laying hens; the cow of 600 kg body weight supplies annually 4-8 L of first colostrum featuring Ig concentration 40-120 g/L; the porker gains its body weight of 110 kg within half a year -the blood collected at slaughter can supply 1-1.5 L blood serum/plasma of concentration 10-25 g Ig/L; the laying hen of an attractive source of antibodies, willingly applied and easy to process. Bovine IgG 1 prevails in colostrum and milk. When applied orally it is advantageously more resistant to digestion than other classes (de Rham and Isliker, 1977) ; resistance of this subclass to digestion is comparable to that of IgA. Bovine colostral secretory IgA would also resist proteolysis within the digestive tract, but the amount produced is very low (McClead and Gregory, 1984) . The presence of trypsin inhibitor in colostrum provides for IgG 1 protection; the inhibitor protects IgG 1 from proteolytic degradation in the intestine and moreover its concentration is positively correlated to IgG 1 concentration (Quigley et al., 1995) . Orally given colostral antibodies derived from cows immunized with rotavirus or Clostridium difficile retain their activity after passage through human intestine (Roos et al., 1995; Kelly et al., 1997; Pacyna et al., 2001) . Long-term in vitro digestion of colostrum whey with chymotrypsin resulted in maintenance of antibacterial IgG activity with simultaneous decline of IgM activity (Brock et al., 1978) , while digestion with trypsin reduced IgG activity, but left IgM activity hardly changed. The authors determined the specific activity which required complete immunoglobulin molecules. In the digestive tract, the activity of the (Fab) 2 fragment alone is quite sufficient to satisfactorily restrict the possibility of contact between the organism and the mucous membrane (Reilly et al., 1997) . Protection of the mucosal membrane is maintained in spite of proteolysis of IgG and IgA immunoglobulin molecules (McClead and Gregory, 1984; Hilpert et al., 1987; Molla et al., 1988) .\n\nA well-known method of preventing diarrhea in neonatal calves is twice a day administration of surplus colostrum of the first and second milking mixed with milk or milk substitute throughout the period of the greatest risk of diarrhea, usually up to 10-12 days of life (Castrucci et al., 1984; M\u00f6stl and B\u00fcrki, 1988; Gutzwiller, 2002) . Cow colostrum from nonimmunized cows or cows hyperimmunized with rotavirus, coronavirus, Escherichia coli or Shigella successfully prevents diarrhea also in neonates of other species (Brunser et al., 1992; Klobasa et al., 1994; Tzipori et al., 1994; Gomez et al., 1998; Ashraf et al., 2001; Shibata et al., 2001) .\n\nThere are several indications for the application of cow colostrum to foals, lambs and kids (Klobasa et al., 1991; Winter and Clarkson, 1992; Perl et al., 1995) : \u2022 lack of, or low quality of maternal colostrum \u2022 mastitis \u2022 twins or multiple fetuses \u2022 control of the infectious diseases transmitted through colostrum (caprine arthritisencephalitis, maedi-visna, mycoplasmosis).\n\nIgY differs from mammal IgG in having a higher molecular weight, i.e. about 170 kDa, due to the occurrence of four C H domains in the heavy chain (Shimizu et al., 1988; Nakai et al., 1994) . Egg yolk immunoglobulin displays high susceptibility to aggregation in salt solutions (1.5 M NaCl) and it is more susceptible to a decrease of pH to 2.0-4.0, as well as to digestion with proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, chymotrypsin) and is less heat-resistant than rabbit IgG (Shimizu et al., 1992; Hatta et al., 1993a, b) . No considerable differences were found in the resistance to low pH, to proteolysis and to heat between IgY and cattle, goat and swine IgG (Shimizu et al., 1993b; Dominguez et al., 2001) . Egg yolk is a rich source of IgY, containing about 10-25 mg IgY/ml. From this value one can calculate that a single laying hen can produce 30-40 g IgY per year (Mine and Kovacs-Nolan, 2002) . In proportion to animal body mass, the production volume of immunoglobulins is several times higher than that from other comparable sources (such as rabbit and swine serum or cow colostrum). Noninvasive harvest of eggs, and easy IgY isolation are additional advantages (Tini et al., 2002) . So far, IgY has been applied in prophylaxis and therapy in calves -against enterotoxic E. coli K99, Salmonella spp., rotaviruses, coronaviruses, Cryptosporidium spp.; in piglets -against enterotoxic E. coli K99, K88 and 987P, and against rotaviruses; in mice -against rotaviruses; in rabbits -against enterotoxic E. coli; also in humans -against enterotoxic and enteropathogenic E. coli, rotavirus (Barz et al., 1980; O'Farelly et al., 1992; Yokoyama et al., 1992; Erhard et al., 1996; Ikemori et al., 1997; Amaral et al., 2002) . IgY preparations were successfully applied during the periods of the greatest risk, i.e. in neonates and in newly weaned animals. Yet, egg yolk immunoglobulin has not been used so far on a large scale in humans, except for Japan and South Korea, where it is an additive to yoghurts, sweets and baby food.\n\nA single dose of 65 mg IgY, from hens immunized with E. coli K88, assured specific antibody activity was present for up to 24 h in the colon of piglets aged 1-21 days (Yokoyama et al., 1993) . When broiler chickens were given 0.5-1 g of IgY/kg feed, IgY antibody activity against E. coli O157, Salmonella enteritidis, S. typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae were recorded in the feces. The intensity of the ELISA reaction was proportional to the IgY dose (Stefaniak et al., 2004) .\n\nMost studies involved the use of whole yolk from hens immunized with definite antigens on an experimental scale (Barz et al., 1980; Yokoyama et al., 1992; Rzedzicki and Wernicki, 1994; Erhard et al., 1996; Ikemori et al., 1997) . Air-dried immunoglobulin preparations obtained from commercial eggs displayed antibody activity against diarrheal strains of Escherichia coli O157, Salmonella enteritidis, S. typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae and was successfully applied (in the dose of 1-2 g/kg feed or 1 L of a milk-substituting preparation), in the prophylaxis of diarrhea in weaned calves as well as in suckling and weaned piglets (Stefaniak, 2002; Ga sowska and Stefaniak, 2003; Stefaniak et al., 2003) . High levels of addition (5-20%) of spray-dried whole eggs can restrict the calves' and piglets' weight gain because of the presence of protease inhibitors in egg white, as well as because of the differences in amino acid content in egg as compared to the needs of those mammals (Quigley, 2002; DeRouchey et al., 2003; Owusu-Asiedu et al., 2003a, b) .\n\nSerum produced from the blood of slaughtered swine allows the large-scale production of immunoglobulins. A commonly used supplement of fodder is spray-dried porcine plasma -SDPP (DeRouchey et al., 2003; Schmidt et al., 2003) . It contains the whole spectrum of serum proteins, including the biologically active ones. In the commonly proposed doses (5-10% addition to the fodder) it constitutes an important source of alimentary protein (Schmidt et al., 2003) . In the proposed amounts it results in a considerable increase of feeding costs. Spraydried swine plasma is commercially available in the USA and other countries and is applied orally to suckling and early-weaned piglets. Due to the savouriness of fodder containing SDPP the piglets eat it in higher amounts and achieve higher weight gains than the control piglets fed with standard fodder.\n\nRabbit immune serum was successfully applied orally to rats experimentally infected with a pathogenic E. coli strain (Rivier and Sobotka, 1978) . Immunoglobulins originating from cows immunized with V. cholerae were introduced with satisfactory results concerning rabbit protection (Boesman-Finkelstein et al., 1989) . Swine serum possesses IgG fractions with different resistance to cleavage by trypsin or pepsin (Olsovska et al., 1982) . Because of the fact that spray-dried blood serum preparations are significantly contaminated, it is advisible for them to undergo irradiation (DeRouchey et al., 2003) .\n\nAn important problem with oral administration is proteolysis of the immunoglobulins by digestive enzymes, while another problem is caused by inactivation of antibody activity due to low pH. Irreversible inactivation of nonprotected IgY occurs at pH below 4. There are some methods proposed to protect the applied antibodies against proteolysis by gastric juice at low pH, e.g. use of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate (Ikemori et al., 1996) . In the opinion of Ikemori and coworkers (1996) spray-drying of IgY with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phtalate resulted in the protective binding or coating of antibodies. It enabled them to withstand acidic condition and to retain the antibody activity during the passage through the small intestine. Acid stability of IgY was enhanced in the presence of 30% sorbitol (Lee et al., 2002) , or by encapsulation of IgY in the liposomes (Shimizu et al., 1993a) .\n\nBovine IgG 1 is the major immunoglobulin in cow colostrum and milk and it is more resistant to digestion than other immunoglobulin classes, which can be regarded as an advantage for oral administration (de Rham and Isliker, 1977) . High doses of orally given immunoglobulins are more resistant to digestion and low pH within the gastrointestinal tract; at low concentrations their activity disappears before reaching the posterior segments of the intestine (Petschow and Talbott, 1994) . On the other hand, IgG is susceptible to cleavage by bacterial proteases in the vicinity of hinge region, and indeed is more susceptible to cleavage than IgA, while IgA 1 is more susceptible than IgA 2 (Molla et al., 1988) .\n\nOrally given air-dried immunoglobulins of colostrum-supplements were only about one third as effectively absorbed by calves as immunoglobulins from fresh cow colostrum (Garry et al., 1996) . Worse protection caused more frequent pathology in calves. Relatively low doses of air-dried IgY (0.5-2 g/kg body weight), supplied to newborn calves instead of or together with first colostrum, were absorbed from intestine to blood with only 4-8% efficacy (Stefaniak, 2002) .\n\nCow colostrum given to lambs and goat kids during intestinal absorption of immunoglobulins may induce hemolytic anemia, caused by the binding of antibodies to recipient erythrocytes (Winter and Clarkson, 1992; Perl et al., 1995) . Cow colostrum may also be the source of Mycobacterium paratuberculosis in goat kids (Orsel et al., 2000) .\n\nThe products from hyperimmune animals are mostly Kellner et al., 1994) , but not always, more effective than those coming from nonimmune animals (Korhonen et al., 1995; Sarker et al., 2001) . Loimaranta et al. (1998) showed that as little as 2-4 mg/ml of immune and nonimmune colostrum produced visible aggregates with Streptococcus mutans, which occurred in parallel to a reduction of bacterial adhesion. Lower concentrations, producing invisible aggregates, surprisingly increased bacterial adhesion. The authors believe that cow colostrum also contains other components causing Streptococcus aggregation.\n\nImmunoglobulin preparations from nonimmune animals (e.g. air-dried swine serum pooled at slaughter) contain antibodies directed against a broad spectrum of antigens, which are produced during the animal's life. When applied prophylactically, they may be effective in preventing the adhesion of infectious agents to the gut mucosal membrane and in protection against gastrointestinal tract pathology (Lissner et al., 1996; Stefaniak and Kope\u0107, 1997) .\n\nHighly specific immunoglobulin preparations derived from hyperimmunized animals show significantly higher efficiency regarding homologous antigens, but they may not have such broad activity against other pathogens as a pool of a large number of nonimmunized slaughter animals from many herds.\n\nThe choice of timing and duration of oral application of antibodies, their origin, specificity and method of application must be made on the basis of good knowledge about the farm in question ( fig. 6 ). The management and quality of the environment have to be considered. The most important pathogenic factors for the digestive tract of the young animals should be exactly identified. The essential factor to be taken into account is economic assessment, because highly purified preparations from immunized animals may be too expensive for mass prophylactic application.\n\nThe Ig additive in feed or in a milk-replacer (table 4) seems to be the most suitable for prophylaxis, whereas application in capsules or the administration of Ig concentrate is advisable in diarrhea therapy (Kelly et al., 1997; Graczyk et al., 1998 Graczyk et al., , 1999 Ashraf et al., 2001; He et al., 2001; Quigley et al., 2001; Solomon, 2002; Stefaniak et al., 2003 Stefaniak et al., , 2004 .\n\nAs presented in fig. 6 , a number of factors determine whether the oral application will fulfill the expected protective function; many of these factors do not depend on people or animals (Barrington et al., 2002; Stefaniak, 2002; Stefaniak et al., 2003) . Awareness of these factors should contribute to proper diagnosis and to a reduction of the risk of diarrhea on a given farm (Frank and Kaneene, 1992) .\n\nIt seems that in the future, IgY preparations will become more and more important in the protection of the digestive tract of young mammals, since their production on a large scale is undoubtedly easier and less expensive than that of other antibodies (Schade and Hlinak, 1996) .\n\nThe earlier investigation carried out by our team showed that there exists a wide crossreactivity between the most frequent Gram-negative bacteria occurring in farm animals, while antibodies obtained from several animal species against Haemophilus somnus cross-react with antigens of E. coli, Pasteurella multocida, P. haemolytica, Salmonella enteritidids, S. typhimurium, S. dublin and S. gallinarum-pullorum, Klebsiella pneumoniae (Stefaniak et al., 1998 (Stefaniak et al., , 1999 Wieliczko et al., 2000) . Most of the cross-reacting antigens have a mass of 23-45 kDa (Stefaniak et al., 1998) . Parenterally given H. somnus hyperimmune sera showed protective activity against infections caused by different Gram-negative bacteria (Nikolajczuk et al., 1996 , Stefaniak et al., 1999 . It seems extremely attractive for field practice, to isolate the antigens responsible for induction of interspecies protection and the production of an effective subunit vaccine for immunization of laying hens, and then using egg donors as the source of IgY antibodies for the protection of young animals. Finding the least-invasive and low-cost immunization method, as well as achieving the high-titer-specific antibodies will become one of the most important tasks aimed at large-scale production (Hedlund and Hau, 2001) . The decision concerning IgY doses for herds at high and low risk of infection will be a crucial step, which will contribute to the possibility of lowering the costs of protecting the young animals and obtaining the highest clinical effectiveness of the chosen preparation.\n\nIn the future, IgY is expected to be used in the prevention of epidemics of, e.g. typhus or cholera in environmental disasters, the treatment of diarrhea in risk-group patients -suffering from AIDS, in pregnant women and in the protection of the newborn with immune deficiencies or low birth weight (K\u00fchlmann et al., 1988; Shimizu et al., 1988 Shimizu et al., , 1994 .\n\nFurther improvement in IgY purification is expected in the area of technological development concerning production of the preparation. It will have to take into account the relation between procedure costs and the protective effect of the preparation.\n\nStrong expectations have been connected with experimental application of ''plantibodies\"antibodies of required specificity and class, produced by transgenic plants (Ma et al., 1995; Larrick et al., 1998; Chadd and Chamow, 2001; Peeters et al., 2001) . Transgenic plants may be suitable for diagnostic or therapeutic use, as well as for large-scale production of recombinant secretory immunoglobulin A for passive mucosal immunotherapy. The latter application may prove to be revolutionary in the field of efficient protection of young animals Table 4 Methods of oral application of antibodies\n\nMixed with fodder Advantages -young animals usually eat as much as they wish with voluntary access to fodder; fodder containing Ig is tastier, which helps better weight gain Disadvantages -sick animals do not eat, and will lack the protection from the antibodies Additive to Mainly in calves, foals, lambs and goat kids colostrum or milk-Advantages -convenient and easy administration, quite precise dosage replacers Disadvantages -preparation is usually applied twice a day, which may cause considerable fluctuations in the Ig concentration (protective effectiveness) in the digestive tract lumen In capsules Advantages -precise dosage, protection against low stomach pH Disadvantages -additional service is necessary Oral application as Advantages -precise dosage a concentrated solution Disadvantages -additional service is necessary against infections, because of its low costs and the large scale of immunoglobulin production (Hiatt and Ma, 1993; Sharp and Doran, 2001) . Theoretically, obtaining immunoglobulins from transgenic plants considerably exceeds the amounts which can be produced from animals."}
