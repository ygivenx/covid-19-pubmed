{"title": "Crosstalk between autophagy and inflammatory signaling pathways: balancing host defence and homeostasis HHS Public Access The role of autophagy in immunity", "body": "characterized. Depletion of amino acids or growth factors induces autophagy by inhibiting mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a master regulator of metabolism that inhibits the ULK1 complex through phosphorylation under nutrient replete conditions (Box 1). Once freed from inhibition, the ULK1 complex phosphorylates beclin-1 to activate the class III PI3K (PI3KC3) complex 1 , which creates PI3P-rich subdomains at regions associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), such as the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment or ER-mitochondria contact sites 2, 3 . PI3P binding proteins then recruit the ATG16L1 complex to this autophagosome precursor site (isolation membrane) 4 . The ATG16L1 complex anchors the ubiquitin-like molecule LC3 to the lipid bilayer by conjugating LC3 to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (Box 1). Next, LC3-PE mediates membrane tethering and fusion to extend the isolation membrane through recruiting lipids, which are likely derived from multiple membrane sources including endosomal vesicles harboring the transmembrane protein ATG9L1. The growing isolation membrane eventually fuses with itself to form the enclosed double-membrane structure, and class C VPS and SNARE-like proteins mediate fusion with endo-lysosomal vesicles leading to the degradation and recycling of the contents.\n\nThe generation of the autophagosome is mediated by the sequential activities of three key protein complexes: the ULK1 complex (ULK1, FIP200, ATG13, and ATG101), the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3KC3) complex (Beclin-1, VPS34, VPS15, and ATG14L), and the ATG16L1 complex (ATG16L1, ATG5, and ATG12). Inhibition of mTORC1, such as through nutrient deprivation, allows the ULK1 complex to activate the PI3KC3 complex (see the figure) . The ATG16L1 complex is recruited by the PI3Pbinding protein WIPI2 to the autophagosome precursor structure (isolation membrane) when the PI3KC3 complex creates PI3P-rich regions on the surface of the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment or other membranes. The ATG16L1 complex is generated through an ubiquitin-like (UBL) conjugation reaction in which the UBL molecule ATG12 is conjugated to ATG5 by the sequential action of ATG7 and ATG10. ATG16L1 noncovalently binds the ATG5-ATG12 conjugate to form a multimeric complex. In parallel, another UBL molecule, LC3, is processed by the ATG4 protease and subjected to a second UBL conjugation reaction involving ATG7 and ATG3. The ATG16L1 complex conjugates LC3 and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to complete the reaction. LC3-PE mediates membrane tethering and fusion to extend the isolation membrane through recruiting membranes from multiple sources, eventually leading to self-fusion and the formation of the autophagosome. Subsequent fusion with the lysosome, mediated by class C VPS and SNARE-like proteins, leads to the degradation of the contents.\n\nIn this article, the function and regulation of autophagy in the context of inflammatory signals will be reviewed. It is now appreciated that autophagy function is critical to both cell autonomous defense and multicellular immunity alike, and autophagy dysfunction appears to be a recurring theme in inflammatory disease. First, the general function of autophagy in immunity will be summarized. The focus of the second section will be on specific modes of intersection between autophagy and immune pathways, especially signaling downstream of innate immune sensors. The third section will provide examples of how these mechanisms contribute to multicellular immune responses, with an emphasis on adaptive immunity and inflammatory disease. Finally, the barriers for targeting the autophagy pathway to treat disease will be discussed.\n\nAutophagy can eliminate an infectious threat by promoting xenophagy, whereby intracellular pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, and protozoans are trapped within an autophagosome and targeted to the lysosome for destruction. Xenophagy depends on adaptor molecules that crosslink pathogens with the autophagy machinery. For instance, sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1; also known as p62), nuclear domain 10 protein NDP52, optineurin (OPTN), and TAX1-binding protein 1 (TAX1BP1) bind LC3 along with host molecules associated with damaged Salmonella-containing vacuoles, including ubiquitin and galectin-8 5 . These binding events allow the isolation membrane to grow around Salmonella resulting in its sequestration within the autophagosome. One of the most compelling evidence that autophagy is an important cell-intrinsic defense mechanism is that many invasive pathogens encode virulence factors that counteract the pathway, as exemplified by the LC3-deconjugating enzyme RavZ secreted by Legionella pneumophila 6 . Also, autophagy enhances cell-to-cell spread of enteroviruses by providing a membrane coat during egress 7 . Some pathogens are neutralized by non-canonical functions of the autophagy machinery, hereon referred to as 'non-canonical autophagy' (Box 2). For instance, LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) mediates phagosome maturation, and requires many of the same proteins as conventional autophagy but occurs independently of autophagosome formation 8 . Another form of non-canonical autophagy induced by IFN\u03b3 restricts norovirus and Toxoplasma gondii replication in macrophages in a lysosome-independent manner [9] [10] [11] . In the case of T. gondii infection, the ATG16L1 complex and LC3 disrupt the parasitophorous vacuole by recruiting p47 immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) and p65 guanylate binding proteins (GBPs) 9, [12] [13] [14] [15] . Although it is not always clear whether the classical or an unconventional form of autophagy is involved in host defense, autophagy proteins remain strong candidates as drug targets in infectious disease. Inducing autophagy with a cell permeable beclin-1 peptide protects against multiple pathogens in vitro and in vivo, including chikungunya and West Nile viruses 16 .\n\nSeveral processes have been described in which subsets of the canonical autophagy pathway (see box figure, part a) contribute to immune responses, frequently independent of autophagosome formation. LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) mediates the maturation of phagosomes containing TLR ligands independently of the ULK1 complex, but requires the association of rubicon with the PI3KC3 complex 8 (see box figure, part b). Brucella abortus subverts the ULK1 and PI3KC3 complexes, but not the ATG16L1 complex or LC3, to generate pathogen-containing vacuoles which can either be single or double membrane structures 160 (see box figure, part c). The recruitment of IFN-\u03b3 effector molecules (IRGs and GBPs) to the parasitophorous vacuole during Toxoplasma gondii infection is dependent on the the ATG16L1 complex but not autophagosome formation or lysosomes 11 (see box figure, part d). A similar process is involved in inhibition of norovirus replication by IFN-\u03b3 10 . ATG5 prevents neutrophil-mediated lung damage during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection independently of the other ATG16L1 complex members 161 (see box figure, part e). It is unclear whether this function of ATG5 represents a type of non-canonical autophagy or a new function of ATG5. There are several other examples not depicted. Coronavirus replication occurs on ER-derived membranes decorated by the unconjugated form of LC3, and does not require the rest of the autophagy machinery 162 . ATG9L1 represses DNA stimulation of STING independently of the LC3 conjugation machinery. LC3 can be recruited to doublemembrane structures containing internalized Salmonella in the absence of ATG9L1 and subunits of the ULK1 and PI3KC3 complexes 163 . The inhibitory activity of ATG16L1 on NOD1 and NOD2 signaling can occur independently of the autophagy function of this protein 164 . CD4 T cell recognition of DCs harboring T. gondii was shown to depend on ATG5 and not ATG7 165 . Thus, the immune function of conserved autophagy proteins often reflects a non-canonical form of autophagy.\n\nAutophagy also reduces damage inflicted by pathogens. During Sindbis virus infection, autophagy protects against neuronal cell death without affecting the degree of viral replication 17 . Similarly, in the absence of ATG16L1, the beneficial intestinal virus murine norovirus (MNV) 18 triggers intestinal pathologies in mice through the cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 19 . Viral replication is unaltered in these mice 19 , consistent with a role for autophagy in suppressing the negative impact of inflammatory cytokines produced in responses to an enteric virus. Furthermore, TFEB (HLH-30), a master transcriptional regulator of autophagy and lysosomal genes, protects Caenorhabditis elegans from Staphylococcus aureus infection by promoting a cytoprotective transcriptional response 20 . Autophagy is also essential for the survival of mice with S. aureus-mediated bacteremia and pneumonia. Instead of reducing bacterial burden in these animals, autophagy promotes the viability of endothelial cells in the presence of a pore-forming toxin produced by widely circulating methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains 21 . The vulnerability of autophagy-deficient cells reflects an increase in the toxin receptor ADAM10 at the protein level 21 , indicating that the protein turnover function of autophagy can indirectly contribute to infectious disease susceptibility. Therapeutically increasing autophagy also improves survival in a mouse model of sepsis through reducing inflammation in the lung 22 . Thus, in addition to resistance mechanisms aimed at reducing the number of infectious agents, autophagy facilitates tolerance mechanisms that reduce the adverse effect of an infection 23 .\n\nA related function of autophagy is to inhibit the production of soluble inflammatory mediators, which can come at the cost of diminishing host defense. Deficiency in autophagy proteins protects against intestinal infection by Citrobacter rodentium, improves survival during lung infection by influenza virus, and prevents reactivation of murine herpesvirus 68 (MHV68) from latency [24] [25] [26] . The enhanced host defense in these models are associated with large scale increases in cytokine levels and/or inflammatory gene expression. Although autophagy inhibition confers a short-term benefit during infection by these specific pathogens, the long-term consequence of this heightened immunity may be chronic inflammatory disease. Additionally, as the above examples with S. aureus, Sindbis virus, and a large number of other studies illustrate, autophagy usually benefits the host during a lifethreatening infection. The ultimate function of autophagy in immunity may be to mediate a balanced immune response whereby the greatest number of different types of infectious threats are neutralized with as little damage to the host as possible, thereby staving off long term disease.\n\nAmino acid starvation during bacterial infection can induce autophagy 27 , raising the possibility that sensing changes in nutrient availability is an ancient mechanism to turn on autophagy in response to infectious threats. As the immune system evolved, autophagy and related pathways have been integrated into the complex signaling networks that coordinate multicellular defense strategies. An array of pathogen and damage associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs) induce or inhibit autophagy in specific contexts. Also, autophagy can feedback on the process of PAMP and DAMP recognition to serve a regulatory role of preventing an over exuberant response. This creates a set of feedback loops between autophagy and immune signaling pathways that mediate host defense while limiting damage.\n\nNOD-like receptors (NLRs) are cytosolic sensors of PAMPs and DAMPs. Many NLRs are inflammasome subunits that mediate IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 production and pyroptosis. The NLRP3 inflammasome, for instance, is activated by diverse stimuli that disrupt mitochondrial integrity, including ATP, bacterial products, and uric acid crystals. Mitophagy, a selective form of autophagy tasked with removing damaged mitochondria, inhibits IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 production in response to these stimuli by preventing the accumulation of mitochondria-derived DAMPs, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial DNA [28] [29] [30] (Figure 1 ). Autophagy also removes or prevents leakage of bacterial products from Shigella or Salmonella-containing vacuoles into the cytoplasm, thereby limiting detection of microbial factors in the cytosol by the caspase-11 inflammasome 31,32 . This model is consistent with a role for autophagy in repairing damaged pathogen-containing vacuoles 33 , and the observation that autophagy prevents pyroptosis in the presence of invasive bacteria 32, 34, 35 . In addition to these examples in which autophagy limits the availability of inflammasome activators (ROS, mtDNA, LPS) in the cytosol, one study has shown that SQSTM1 can target the inflammasome subunit ASC for incorporation into an autophagosome, leading to its inactivation 36 . These examples illustrate the critical role of autophagy in suppressing inflammation through the removal of PAMPs, DAMPs, and inflammatory signaling intermediates from the cytosol, a theme that will be reinforced throughout this article.\n\nNLRs also have a role in inducing autophagy in response to the presence of PAMPs and DAMPs in the cytosol. Sensing of uric acid and nigericin by NLRP3, or recognition of poly(dA:dT) double-stranded DNA by AIM2, induces autophagy by triggering nucleotide exchange on the small GTPase RalB 36 . Amino acid deprivation also signals through RalB to induce autophagy by creating a large multi-protein complex with the exocyst protein Exo84 that links the ULK1 and PI3KC3 complexes 37 . Interestingly, autophagy induction downstream of GCN2, which senses amino acid depletion, dampens inflammasome-mediated intestinal damage following chemical injury 38 . Thus, nutrient sensing pathways may have been repurposed for inducing autophagy during inflammatory stress.\n\nNLR activation by infectious agents generally induces autophagy. During L. pneumophila infection of macrophages, flagellin that leaks from the vacuole into the cytosol is recognized by NAIP5 and NLRC4, and the formation of the inflammasome complex induces autophagy by releasing beclin-1 from an inhibitory interaction with NLRC4 35 . Also, the NLRP6 inflammasome regulates the composition of the gut microbiota and is required for autophagosome formation in the intestinal epithelium 39 . As discussed later, autophagy induction in epithelial cells is critical to the intestinal barrier. These examples indicate that activation of inflammasomes is coupled with induction of autophagy, which most likely reflects the property of inflammasomes as a double-edged sword, where some activity is essential for defense, but excessive cytokine release and pyroptosis cause irreparable damage to the host. NOD1 and NOD2, the founding members of the NLR family, also induce autophagy. In the presence of bacterial peptidoglycan derivatives, these molecules signal through the adaptor kinase RIP2 to induce NF\u03baB and MAPK signaling. Both NOD1 and NOD2 mediate the recruitment of LC3 to vesicles containing internalized bacteria to initiate xenophagy ( Figure  1 ), although there is disagreement regarding whether this process involves signaling through RIP2 or direct binding between the NLR and ATG16L1 [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] .\n\nThe induction of autophagy following NOD1 and NOD2 activation can dampen the immune response. Specifically, cytokine production by myeloid cells in the presence of bacteria or bacterial ligands that activate NOD2 is increased in the absence of autophagy proteins [46] [47] [48] [49] . NOD2 also recognizes viral RNA, and subsequent RIP2 signaling induces mitophagy through ULK1 phosphorylation. Consequently, NOD2 or RIP2 deficiency increases ROS production by mitochondria and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which exacerbates lung inflammation during influenza virus infection 50 . Similarly, NOD2-RIP2 signaling induces autophagy in alveolar macrophages to suppress inflammation caused by the inflammasome during acute lung injury 51 . Additionally, NOD2 is required for induction of a LAP-like process in dendritic cells (DCs) following internalization of outer-membrane vesicles (OMVs) derived from the commensal bacterium Bacteroides fragillus, a process that mediates regulatory T cell differentiation 52 . Although the mechanistic contribution of LAP in this setting remains unclear, this study demonstrates a novel role for non-canonical autophagy in suppressing immune reactions at barrier sites where microbial encounters are common. All together, these studies indicate that a major function of autophagy is to keep the immune system in check by counteracting the pro-inflammatory functions of NLRs.\n\nToll-like receptors (TLRs) sense PAMPs at the cell surface or in vesicle lumens, and signal through adaptor proteins MYD88 and/or TRIF to activate TRAF6, which catalyzes lysine 63 (K63) ubiquitination of several signaling intermediates upstream of NF\u03baB and MAPK to induce inflammatory gene expression. Both MYD88 and TRIF signaling promote autophagosome formation (Figure 1) , perhaps explaining why a broad range of TLR ligands are capable of inducing autophagy 53, 54 . Upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure, TLR4 promotes the assembly of the PI3KC3 complex through TRAF6-mediated K63 ubiquitination of beclin-1 to free it from an inhibitory interaction with BCL-2 55 . Signaling through MYD88 and NF\u03baB further increase autophagosome maturation by inducing the expression of DRAM1, a lysosomal transmembrane protein involved in lysosomal acidification 56 . The ability to target specific substrates to the autophagosome is facilitated by transcriptional induction of SQSTM1 downstream of TLR4 57 . In addition, LPS-induced SQSTM1 recognizes ubiquitin-tagged mitochondria to promote mitophagy-mediated suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome 30 ( Figure 1 ) and thus, the induction of SQSTM1 explains why NF\u03baB signaling is sometimes counter-intuitively anti-inflammatory. TLR4/ TRIF activation by Gram-negative bacteria can also induce TRAF3-mediated K63 ubiquitination of TBK1, a kinase that phosphorylates optineurin to increase its binding affinity for LC3, thereby promoting xenophagy by crosslinking LC3 and bacteria bound to optineurin 58 . These studies indicate that pathogen-sensing by TLRs triggers multiple signaling events that converge on pathogen and organelle-specific autophagy.\n\nImportantly, TLR-mediated induction of autophagy has been validated in vivo. Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV) triggers autophagy downstream of TLR7 signaling to restrict viral replication in Drosophila melanogaster 59 . In mice, MYD88-dependent induction of autophagy in the intestinal epithelium prevents dissemination of Salmonella 60 . Unlike NLRs in the cytosol, the ability to detect the presence of PAMPs prior to a breach in the membrane may explain why a role for TLR-induced autophagy can be detected as early as 24 hours post-infection in this setting.\n\nCommunication between autophagy and TLRs is bidirectional. Autophagy delivers viral RNA to the endosome for TLR7 recognition in plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) 61 . In at least some examples, effector functions downstream of TLRs require LC3 recruitment to phagosomes through LAP (Figure 1 ). When antibody-bound DNA complexes are internalized by pDCs and bind Fc\u03b3 receptor (Fc\u03b3R), LAP mediates the maturation of the phagosome to a vesicle that supports type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling downstream of TLR9 62 . The acidification of phagosomes containing TLR2 ligands in macrophages also occurs through LAP 63 . Melanin on the cell wall of the fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus inhibits ROS production by the NADPH oxidase, which together with TLR recognition of fungal surface molecules, is a necessary step in recruiting autophagy proteins. However, A. fumigatus is unable to evade LAP upon removal of melanin during germination, and is ultimately degraded 8, 64 . These findings demonstrate how autophagy and LAP support vesicle trafficking events that are critical for TLR-mediated cytokine production and pathogen degradation.\n\nIn contrast to the above examples, there are situations in which autophagy proteins and TLRs have an antagonistic relationship. SQSTM1 serves a dual function as both an adaptor molecule for autophagy and a scaffolding protein that binds TRAF6 to mediate NFkB signaling downstream of TLRs 65 . In keratinocytes, SQSTM1 is targeted for autophagic degradation by virtue of binding to LC3, thereby disrupting TLR4 and TLR2 signaling 66 . In another example of autophagy and TLR antagonism, MYD88 signaling upon TLR2 recognition of Mycobacterium tuberculosis induces a microRNA (miRNA) that inhibits autophagy by targeting UVRAG, a subunit of the PI3K3C complex, resulting in increased bacterial survival 67 . Unlike the extensive antagonistic relationship observed between NLRs and autophagy, these situations in which autophagy and TLR signaling inhibit one another have thus far been exceptions and may apply to specific cell types or pathogens.\n\nWhile autophagy proteins typically promote TLR signaling in the presence of vesicle-bound nucleic acid, autophagy proteins mediate mitophagy to inhibit signaling downstream of cytosolic sensors of viral nucleic acid. RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) RIG-I and MDA5 sense double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in the cytosol and signal through the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), which oligomerizes on the mitochondrial outer-membrane to induce IFN-I expression by activating the transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7. Mitophagy suppresses IFN-I production by removing the platform for RLR signaling and causes degradation of signaling intermediates such as MAVS [68] [69] [70] (Figure 2a) . ROS produced by accumulating mitochondria also contributes to excess IFN-I production when mitophagy is inhibited 71 . When MAVS signaling is triggered by viral infection, the ATG16L1 complex is recruited to mitochondria by NLRX1, TUFM, and COX5b 68,70 (Figure 2a) . For this reason, cells deficient in autophagy proteins, NLRX1, or COX5b display enhanced IFN-I production and are better able to restrict the replication of a variety of viruses [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] . Presumably, mitophagy is coupled to detection of cytosolic RNA to prevent sustained pathological IFN-I production, but this model has not been formally demonstrated.\n\nAutophagy also intersects with pathways responsible for sensing cytosolic DNA, which is associated with viral infection, intracellular bacteria, and autoimmunity. Cyclic dinucleotides generated by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) in the presence of dsDNA activate the transmembrane protein stimulator of interferon genes (STING) to induce IFN-I expression. STING colocalizes with autophagy proteins including LC3, and loss of ATG9L1 leads to aberrant STING trafficking and activation 73 . However, STING function was unaffected by deletion of the E1-like enzyme ATG7 73 , implicating a non-canonical autophagy pathway in membrane trafficking events during dsDNA recognition. Also, ULK1 phosphorylates STING to inhibit IRF3 and aberrant IFN-I expression 74 (Figure 2b ). Similar to autophagy induction during glucose starvation, cyclic dinucleotides induce AMPactivated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, which leads to phosphorylation and activation of ULK1, thus serving as a negative feedback loop 74 . During herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) infection, beclin-1 binds and inhibits cGAS. This interaction simultaneously frees beclin-1 from inhibition by rubicon (run domain Beclin-1-interacting and cysteine-rich domain-containing protein) to enhance PI3KC3 activity and autophagy-mediated degradation of viral DNA, thus reducing both the amount of cytosolic DNA and the downstream signaling 75 (Figure 2b ). Autophagy also prevents pathological STING activation by targeting damaged DNA that leaks from the nucleus to the lysosome where it is degraded by DNASE2a 76 .\n\nSpontaneous IFN-I signaling occurs upon autophagy inhibition in intestinal tissue and tumor cells 24, 77, 78 , indicating that autophagy in some organs or cell types is constitutively suppressing cytokine release. An IFN-I signature in the absence of an infectious trigger could reflect an inappropriate immune response to host nucleic acid, the microbiota, or endogenous retroviruses. Given our growing appreciation of the contribution of IFN-I to cancer and autoimmunity, this autophagy-mediated control of cytokine expression under steady-state conditions is likely relevant to situations beyond infectious disease.\n\nConsistent with the role of autophagy in supporting cellular immunity, the Th1 cytokines interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) and TNF\u03b1 generally upregulate xenophagy in target cells [79] [80] [81] . IFN\u03b3 induces autophagy through the JAK1/JAK2 and p38 MAPK pathway independently of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) 82 . In turn, autophagy promotes IFN\u03b3 signaling by limiting ROS production, which if left to accumulate, would activate the JAK/STAT inhibitory phosphatase SHP2 83 (Figure 2c ). In addition to conventional autophagy, IFN\u03b3 induces a LAP-like process in hepatocytes infected by the malarial parasite Plasmodium vivax. The deposition of LC3 onto the parasitophorous vacuole leads to the recruitment of lysosomes and killing of the parasite 84 . As mentioned earlier, IFN\u03b3 suppress T. gondii and norovirus replication through an incompletely understood type of noncanonical autophagy [9] [10] [11] . Therefore, IFN\u03b3 induces canonical and non-canonical autophagy to inhibit intracellular pathogen replication.\n\nCytokines that signal through other STAT molecules do not necessarily induce autophagy. Binding of protein kinase R (PKR) by STAT3 prevents PKR-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, a stress-responsive regulator of translation that promotes autophagy 85 (Figure 2c ). As seen with IL-10, any cytokine that activates STAT3 can theoretically interfere with autophagy 86 . STAT6 signaling downstream of the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 also inhibits autophagy induction by IFN\u03b3 in macrophages 80 . However, DCs differentiated in the presence of IL-4 display increased expression of RUFY4, a positive regulator of autophagosome growth and fusion with lysosomes 87 . The amount of time the cell is exposed to Th2 cytokines, and the presence of other cytokines such as IFN\u03b3 and GM-CSF, may explain these contradictory effects of Th2 cytokines on autophagy. These studies establish a link between autophagy and Th2 or regulatory cytokines. How this impacts host defense requires further investigation.\n\nAutophagy inhibits IL-1\u03b2 production by repressing inflammasome activation, but can facilitate the secretion of this cytokine 88 . IL-1\u03b2 does not undergo conventional secretion due to the absence of a signal peptide, but can pass through a permeabilized plasma membrane 89 . Alternatively, when membrane integrity is intact, IL-1\u03b2 can be incorporated into the space between the inner-and outer-membrane of the autophagosome, and is released from the cell following autophagosome fusion with the plasma membrane or multivesicular body 90 (Figure 2d ). IL-1\u03b2 is ultimately secreted from autophagy-deficient cells, likely because of the permeabilized membrane accompanying increased inflammasome activity and pyroptosis.\n\nSecreted IL-1\u03b2, in turn, activates autophagy through TBK1 91 (Figure 2d ). IL-1\u03b2 (also IL-1\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3) induces ubiquitination of beclin-1, suggesting that it can also activate autophagy through a mechanism similar to LPS (Figure 1) . Finally, secretion of other IL-1 family members, specifically IL-1\u03b1 and MIF, is increased in autophagy-deficient macrophages as a downstream consequence of mitochondrial ROS accumulation 92, 93 . It is likely that autophagy induction following the engagement of the IL-1R is another mechanism of negative feedback through ROS suppression.\n\nAutophagy may be particularly important for preventing Th17 responses because the cytokines that are suppressed by autophagy are key to inducing IL-17 expression by T cells: IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, IL-23, IL-6, TGF\u03b2, and MIF 47,92-95 . Excess IL-1\u03b1 released by autophagy-deficient macrophages induces Th17 differentiation and exacerbates lung inflammation during M. tuberculosis infection (Figure 3) . Similarly, IL-1\u03b2 produced downstream of autophagy inhibition in DCs acts in an autocrine manner to mediate IL-23 production, leading to IL-17 secretion by \u03b3\u03b4T cells 94 . There is less evidence that Th1 and other branches of adaptive immunity benefit from autophagy-deficiency in macrophages and DCs. One reason may be that IFN-I, which is over-produced upon autophagy-inhibition, is known to inhibit IFN\u03b3 activity 96 . An inflammatory milieu could also cause T cell exhaustion. As discussed later, the role of autophagy in antigen presentation is another variable that requires consideration.\n\nCell death can lead to extracellular release of DAMPs that are confined within the cell, such as nucleic acids, ATP, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and IL-1\u03b2. Autophagy is induced by ATP, and controls the secretion of ATP. Purinergic receptors and transporters that recognize exogenous ATP triggers autophagy through AMPK-mediated mTOR inhibition and dephosphorylation of AKT 97-100 . Prior to cell death, autophagy regulates the secretion of ATP by mediating the migration of ATP-containing lysosomes towards the plasma membrane 101 . Due to the importance of ATP as a chemotactic signal, loss of autophagy in tumor cells diminishes the ability of chemotherapeutic agents to trigger a robust anti-tumor immune response (Figure 3 ) 102 .\n\nLike IL-1\u03b2, autophagy facilitates the release of HMGB1, a chromatin-associated nuclear protein, from stressed or dying tumor cells 103 . Extracellular HMGB1 is recognized by receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), resulting in decreased mTOR activity and increased autophagy 104 . Nuclear HMGB1 regulates the expression of heat shock protein b 1 (HSPB1), a chaperone protein that promotes mitophagy 105 . Also, HMGB1 translocates to the cytosol in the presence of ROS, where it induces autophagy by releasing beclin-1 from inhibition by BCL-2 103 . Endogenous HMGB1 can also promote autophagy by protecting beclin-1 and ATG5 from calpain-mediated cleavage 106 . Thus, when HMGB1 is removed from macrophages or intestinal epithelial cells, the balance shifts from autophagy to apoptosis, and favors exaggerated cytokine production to increase inflammation 106, 107 .\n\nTo summarize, an extensive amount of crosstalk has been observed between autophagy and immune signaling cascades downstream of the array of receptors that recognize PAMPs, DAMPs, and cytokines. The finding that autophagy is sometimes necessary for IFN-I production (e.g., by functioning together with TLRs in pDCs) but can also dampen IFN-I signaling (e.g., through mitophagy) reinforces the fact that the relationship between autophagy and a given immune pathway is context-dependent and not generalizable. However, one recurring observation is that pathways that induce autophagy are often inhibited by autophagy to prevent sustained activation. This role of autophagy in negative feedback is most obvious in the presence of inflammasome substrates and viral nucleic acids in the cytosol, where autophagy limits the amount of cytokines produced. This function is not mutually exclusive from antimicrobial functions of autophagy such as xenophagy; removing the infectious threat and removing the PAMP that triggers the inflammatory response are both ways to restore homeostasis.\n\nA role for autophagy can be seen in virtually all the cell types that participate in adaptive immunity -lymphocytes, antigen presenting cells (APCs), dying cells, and cells that contribute to the inflammatory milieu ( Figure 3) . Autophagy, most likely through mitochondrial quality control, is necessary for the survival and proliferation of T cells (CD4, CD8, and NK T cells) [108] [109] [110] [111] [112] [113] [114] , memory responses of CD8 T cells, and activated NK cell maintenance [115] [116] [117] [118] [119] . In effector CD4 T cells, autophagy activity generates the ATP necessary to produce IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 120 . Autophagy may have analogous functions in maintaining organelle and metabolic homeostasis in the B cell lineage because Atg5 deletion leads to an absence of B-1a B cells and a defect in antibody production by plasma cells [121] [122] [123] . The induction of autophagy in na\u00efve CD4 T cells following TCR stimulation is dependent on mTOR inhibition downstream of the ubiquitin editing enzyme TNFAIP3 (A20) 114 . TCR engagement also induces autophagy-mediated degradation of the upstream NF\u03baB signaling molecule BCL-10, thus preventing hyperactivation of effector T cells 124 . Inhibiting autophagy in regulatory T cells (Tregs) causes apoptosis and lineage instability due to aberrant metabolism, which leads to unrestrained Th2 responses and inflammation at intestinal barrier sites 125, 126 . As expected, the role of autophagy in supporting these various lymphocyte lineages is necessary for optimal immune responses to viruses, parasites, selfantigens, and tumors 115, 122, 125, 126 .\n\nOn the APC side, autophagy affects the repertoire of peptides presented on MHC-II molecules 127 , including by thymic epithelial cells that mediate selection of developing T cells 128 . Specific antigens have been shown to depend on autophagy for presentation. Autophagosomes transport peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) that convert arginine to citrulline, which generates the citrullinated self-peptides implicated in rheumatoid arthritis 129 (Figure 3 ). Autophagy in virally-infected cells generate antigens for presentation to CD4 T cells by delivering cytosolic proteins to the lysosome for antigen processing, such as the Epstein-Barr virus protein EBNA-1 130 (Figure 3 ). In some cases, antigens are generated from ubiquitinated protein aggregates and pathogen-containing vacuoles that are recognized by SQSTM1, which become substrates for either MHC-I or MHC-II presentation 131, 132 . Autophagy can be augmented to enhance antigen presentation through previously discussed signals, such as IFN-\u03b3 and NOD2 activation 41, 131, 132 . Autophagy or LAP is also critical for the processing of exogenous antigens by mediating the fusion of phagosomes containing TLR ligands or apoptotic corpses with lysosomes in DCs 133-135 ( Figure 3 ). This process is necessary for MHC-II presentation that drives the antiviral Th1 response during herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) infection 136 . It is possible that avoidance of CD4 T cell recognition is a major reason why some pathogens encode proteins that inhibit autophagy. For instance, the HSV-1 protein ICP34.5 binds beclin-1 to inhibit autophagymediated MHC-II antigen presentation in DCs 137 .\n\nChallenge with the yellow fever virus vaccine YF-17D induces autophagy in DCs through induction of the amino acid starvation sensor GCN2. Inhibiting either autophagy proteins or GCN2 impairs the ability of DCs to mediate proliferation of CD8 T cells when co-cultured with infected cells 138 (Figure 3) , providing a clinically relevant example of autophagydependent MHC-I cross-presentation. However, as with certain examples of antigen presentation on MHC-II, the role for autophagy proteins revealed by this study may be more likely to reflect LAP rather than autophagy. Now that the tools are available, future studies will be able to distinguish the role of canonical versus non-canonical forms of autophagy in antigen presentation.\n\nGenetic variants that occur near or within autophagy genes are implicated in several inflammatory disorders ( Table 1) . One of the first indicators that autophagy dysfunction contributes to inflammatory disease was provided by the genetic link between Crohn's disease and a common polymorphism in ATG16L1 139 . The disease polymorphism results in a threonine to alanine coding change (T300A) that destabilizes the ATG16L1 protein product by introducing a caspase-3 cleavage site 48, 49 . The function of autophagy in inhibiting cytokine production is consistent with the idea that this disease stems from an exaggerated immune response directed towards the gut microbiota. Additionally, inhibiting autophagy within the intestinal epithelium causes defects in antimicrobial granule formation by Paneth cells and mucus secretion by goblet cells 19, [140] [141] [142] . Together with xenophagy, the role of autophagy in maintaining these secretory cell lineages helps prevent breaches of the epithelial barrier by Salmonella and commensal bacteria 60, 143 . The relevance of these epithelial-specific functions of autophagy is supported by the observation that knock-in mice harboring the ATG16L1 T300A disease variant are susceptible to enteric bacterial infections, and display defects in Paneth cells and goblet cells 48, 49 . Also, the crosstalk between the ER stress pathway and autophagy in Paneth cells was shown to have a central role in preventing intestinal inflammation 142 , directly implicating the organelle homeostasis function of autophagy in this secretory cell type.\n\nThe same ATG16L1 T300A polymorphism increases the risk of death following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) 144 . Autophagy was found to prevent lethal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in a preclinical animal model of HSCT by suppressing DC hyperactivity. These autophagy-deficient DCs displayed alterations in the expression of genes implicated in endolysosomal trafficking including those that affect NF\u03baB and MAPK signaling 144 . The reason why autophagy suppresses rather than promotes the ability of DCs to stimulate T cells in this situation is likely explained by differences between allogeneic and syngeneic T cell activation, where the former has less constraints on the antigen being presented. Given that GVHD frequently affects the gut, it would be interesting to determine whether autophagy in the intestinal epithelium also has a role in preventing disease following HSCT.\n\nPolymorphisms associated with increased ATG5 expression are linked to asthma and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 145, 146 . Although it remains possible that these polymorphisms act through neighboring genes and not ATG5, autophagy contributes to biological processes that are relevant to these disorders including regulation of the cytokine milieu and antigen presentation. In airway epithelial cells, autophagy mediates goblet cell differentiation and mucus secretion in response to IL-13 147 , suggesting that enhanced autophagy contributes to the pathological overproduction of mucus observed in asthmatic individuals.\n\nMarkers of increased autophagy have been observed in B and T lymphocytes from SLE patients 148, 149 , which could reflect genetic predisposition, or an attempt to stem further cytokine production. The multi-organ inflammation observed in SLE is associated with immune complexes consisting of antibodies bound to nucleic acid and histones, which induce aberrant IFN-I production following recognition by the DNA and RNA sensors TLR7 and TLR9. LAP, which is dependent on ATG5, mediates the delivery of such immune complexes in pDCs, resulting in TLR9 activation and IFN-I production 62 . Also, ATG5 in B cells is necessary for TLR7-dependent generation of autoantibodies and SLE pathologies, hinting at an early role for autophagy proteins in disease progression 150 . In myeloid cells, ATG5 and other autophagy proteins prevent the production of self-reactive antibodies. Dying cells are not properly degraded by macrophages in LAP-deficient mice, leading to a general increase in serological markers of inflammation and signs of SLE as the animals age 151 . Of note, among the different LAP-deficient mice used in this study were rubicon knockouts, which display increased autophagy. One interpretation of this result is that loss of LAP in myeloid cells is more significant in the development of SLE (in aged mice) than a potential increase in lymphocyte autophagy. Studies that examine the effect of specifically increasing autophagy in B cells are warranted.\n\nThe list of immunological diseases accompanied by autophagy dysfunction extends beyond those caused by mutations in autophagy genes. Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) occurs in individuals harboring loss of function mutations in subunits of the NADPH oxidase, which is necessary for generating ROS and recruiting LC3 to the phagosome 152 . Monocytes from CGD patients are defective in LAP-mediated control of A. fumigatus 64 .\n\nSimilarly, APCs deficient in NAPDH oxidase activity display reduced MHC-I and MHC-II presentation of fungal antigens 133, 153 . Cells from CGD patients also display defects in autophagy-mediated suppression of IL-1\u03b2 in the presence of the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi 47 . This failure of autophagy-mediated control of IL-1\u03b2 production contributes to Th17-driven colitis in CGD patients, which can be treated with an antibody against IL-1R (anakinra) 154 .\n\nA defect in pathogen handling through autophagy may also explain why individuals with Niemen-Pick disease type C 1 (NPC1), a lysosomal storage disorder, sometimes develop granulomatous inflammation in the intestine that resembles Crohn's disease. NPC1 mutation inhibits NOD2-mediated xenophagy 155 . In another example, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance receptor (CFTR) mutation leads to sequestration of the PI3KC3 complex into protein aggregates and downregulation of autophagy 156 . This block in autophagy potentially contributes to chronic lung inflammation and recurring pulmonary infections characteristic of CF. Indeed, CFTR mutation increases susceptibility of macrophages to Burkholderia cenocepacia infection and exacerbates IL-1\u03b2 production 157 . Autophagy inhibition in CF patients is further exacerbated upon treatment with the antibiotic azithromycin, which is associated with increased infection by nontuberculous mycobacteria 158 . Thus, restoration of autophagy may ameliorate many chronic inflammatory disorders.\n\nAutophagy and related processes regulate intracellular trafficking of pathogens, production of inflammatory mediators, and viability of cells that coordinate immunity. Through these functions, the autophagy machinery controls complex multicellular immune responses at the whole organism level. The literature highlighted in this article reinforces three themes related to how these functions of autophagy are integrated into inflammatory signaling cascades to ensure an appropriate response to environmental threats and a return to homeostasis: (1) pathways that induce autophagy are subject to regulation by autophagy, (2) autophagy can increase and decrease different parts of the same inflammatory signaling cascade in a context-dependent manner, and (3) non-canonical autophagy is pervasive. Although these principles apply to the role of autophagy in other situations, they are perhaps most obvious in the recent literature examining the function of autophagy proteins in host defense and inflammatory disease.\n\nThese three themes have implications for the clinical application of autophagy inducers and inhibitors. Short-term induction of autophagy is effective in reducing the burden of intracellular pathogens 16 , and can simultaneously enhance TLR-mediated cytokine production and antigen presentation by DCs to improve adaptive immunity 138 . Treating chronic infections is potentially more challenging and will require consideration of the bidirectional communication between autophagy and inflammation. Also, given the regulatory role of autophagy in immunity, it may be reasonable to ask whether autophagy is actually beneficial for host defense. It is important to remind ourselves that the measure of an effective immune response is not how vigorous it is, but how efficiently the threat is neutralized without damaging the host. Therefore, the role of autophagy in reducing inflammation is not necessarily counterproductive to the role of autophagy in reducing pathogen burden.\n\nTreating complex inflammatory disorders by modulating autophagy has similar challenges. Prior to considering this strategy, it is important to identify the physiological situations in which the net effect of autophagy on the level of IL-1\u03b2, IFN-I, and other cytokines is positive versus negative. It is also equally necessary to determine the cell types and organs most affected by autophagy activity. Although the discovery of non-canonical forms of autophagy has increased the complexity of the field, we may be able to exploit the subtle differences in the function of different parts of the autophagy machinery. Indeed, deleting some autophagy genes in macrophages leads to a more pronounced inflammatory outcome than others 25, 151 , perhaps indicating that inhibition of certain parts of the pathway can be compensated by other membrane trafficking processes, and that some autophagy proteins have partially redundant functions. It may be possible to target different nodes of the autophagy pathway without broadly affecting all the downstream immune functions of autophagy proteins.\n\nFinally, defects in autophagy coincide with aging, metabolic disease, cancer, myopathies, and neurodegenerative disorders. Indeed, transgenic mice engineered to overexpress Atg5 display increased lifespan, and improvements in glucose sensitivity and motor function 159 . If humans are to receive autophagy-based treatments for these conditions associated with aging, it will be necessary to understand the effect of altered autophagy on inflammation, which universally accompanies maladies.\n\nAn evolutionarily conserved process in which double-membrane vacuoles sequester intracellular contents (such as damaged organelles and macromolecules) and target them for degradation, through fusion to lysosomes Xenophagy A cell-intrinsic defense mechanism involving the selective degradation of microorganisms (such as bacteria, fungi, parasites or viruses) through an autophagy-related mechanism\n\nA prototypical adaptor protein that targets ubiquitinated proteins for selective autophagy by binding ubiquitin and LC3.

Recognition of internalized fungal glycans and antibody-bound DNA complexes by TLR2 and the Fc\u03b3 chain receptor (Fc\u03b3R) triggers LAP. As the phagosome matures, the fungal pathogen is degraded and TLR9 signals through interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) and type I interferon (IFN-I) transcription. NOD2 in the cytosol recognizes bacterial peptidoglycan or viral RNA from internalized pathogens and subsequently induces autophagy, either by signaling through RIP2 or by directly recruiting ATG16L1 in a complex with IRGM. Incorporation of the bacteria into the autophagosome is achieved by the LC3 binding proteins SQSTM1, OPTN, NDP52, and others, which recognize the damaged vacuole tagged by ubiquitin (Ub) and galectin-8 (Gal-8). In addition to inhibiting pathogen replication, this process reduces leakage of bacterial LPS to prevent activation of the casapse-11 inflammasome. Autophagy also inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is activated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other factors produced by damaged mitochondria following exposure to exogenous agents including uric acid crystals, ATP, and bacterial toxins. The autophagosome sequesters damaged mitochondria and the NLRP3 binding protein ASC to prevent caspase-1 mediated cleavage of pro-IL-1\u03b2 into its active form.\n\nSeveral examples have been reported in which autophagy regulates cytokine production, or is subject to regulation by cytokines. Viral RNA (vRNA) recognition by RIG-I induces mitochondrial ROS production and MAVS signaling, leading to IFN-I transcription.\n\nMitophagy following recruitment of the ATG16L1 complex by NLRX1 and TUFM (or COX5B, not shown) inhibits this pathway by removing the MAVS signaling platform and inhibiting ROS production (a). cGAS converts cytosolic DNA (from viruses, bacteria or host) to cGAMP for recognition by STING and subsequent IFN-I signaling. cGAS activates ULK1, which mediates an inhibitory phosphorylation of STING. Also, binding between beclin-1 and cGAS allows beclin-1 to induce autophagy through the PI3KC3 activity to remove the cytosolic DNA and simultaneously inhibits cGAS-dependent IFN-I production (b). IFN-\u03b3 induces autophagy through JAK1, JAK2, and p38. This pathway is reinforced by mitophogy because mitochondrial ROS activates SHP-2, an inhibitor of IFN-\u03b3 signaling. IL-10 can inhibit autophagy by promoting binding between STAT3 and PKR, which inhibits activation of eIF2\u03b1 (c). In addition to suppressing IL-1\u03b2 production by inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome, autophagy mediates the secretion of IL-1\u03b2. Extracellular IL-1\u03b2 signals through the IL-1R and MYD88 to induce autophagy, and autophagosome maturation and degradation of engulfed material including intracellular bacteria is dependent on TBK1 (d).\n\nNat Rev Immunol.

Autophagy in APCs such as dendritic cells delivers intracellular and extracellular antigens to endo-lysosomal vesicles where it can intersect the MHC-II presentation pathway and stimulate a CD4 + T cell response. Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) in autophagosomes generate citrullinated peptides, thereby affecting the repertoire of antigens being presented. Extracellular antigens can also be delivered to the endoso-lysosome by LAP. Autophagy-mediated release of ATP by dying cells, such as those infected by viruses, leads to engulfment by the APC. Internalized antigens from the dying cell can then be crosspresented on MHC-I molecules to stimulate CD8+ T cells, a process mediated by autophagy or potentially LAP downstream of GCN2 activation. The removal of ROS producing mitochondria inhibits calpain-mediated processing of IL-1\u03b1, thereby decreasing Th17 differentiation of CD4+ T cells by secreted IL-1\u03b1. Na\u00efve CD4 + T cells require autophagy for survival and proliferation, and cytokine production once activated. The establishment of memory by CD8 + T cells is also dependent on autophagy.\n\nNat Rev Immunol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2017 November 01."}
