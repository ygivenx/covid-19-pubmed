Transcriptional readthrough of the ORF1a termination codon via a frameshift mechanism results in translation of ORF1b and synthesis of pp1ab. It has been proposed that proteolytic processing of pp1ab releases the RNA polymerase, putative helicase, NTPase, and zinc-binding domains (Lee et al, 1991) . Similar genome organizations and replication strategies among members of the Arteriviridae and Coronaviridae families led to their classifcation under the order Nidovirales (de Vries et al, 1997; Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998) . Inhibition of proteolytic processing during coronaviruses or arteriviruses infection results in reduced viral RNA synthesis, indicating the important roles played by proteinase in viral maturation and infectivity (Kim et al, 1995; de Vries et al, 1997; Liu et al, 1997; Herold et al, 1998; Lim and Liu, 1998; Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998; Shi et al, 1999) .\n\nPrevious studies with MHV strain A59 (MHV-A59)-infected cells demonstrated that pp1a is processed from the amino terminus to produce p28, p65, and p290; p290 is further processed to produce H Teng and SR Weiss Figure 1 Functional domains of MHV-A59 gene 1, ORF1a plasmids, and proteolytic processing scheme of A59 pp1a.

The region in ORF1a that was used to raised rabbit antiserum UP102 (directed against amino acids Met-1 to Gln-592; Denison et al, 1995) is shown. Plasmid constructs pSPN 1 S 1 (Teng et al, 1999) , pSPNK1Msc , and pCITE P 1 P 2a (Teng et al, 1999) are indicated. The locations of the cleavage sites P28 (between Gly-247 and Val-248, Table 1 ), p65 (between Ala-832 and Gly833), and the predicted cleavage sites for p72?

The catalytic residues of PLP-1, Cys-1121 and His-1272, and the catalytic residues of the predicted PLP-2 domain, Cys-1716 and His-1873 (analogous to the catalytic residues Cys-1715 and His-1872 in MHV-JHM PLP-2; Snijder, 1996, Kanjanahaluethai and Baker, 2000) , are also shown. (B) MHV-A59 ORF1a (with its functional domains) and in vivo proteolytic processing products (Denison and Perlman, 1986; Denison et al, 1992 Denison et al, , 1995 Weiss et al, 1994) . The locations of the p28 and p65 cleavage sites, and the predicted cleavage sites for p50? and p72? (JHM) (Schiller et al, 1998) are indicated. (MHV-A59 p290 is believed to extend from the carboxyl terminus of p65 site to the carboxyl terminus of HD1, Denison et al, 1992 Denison et al, , 1995 p50 (amino terminal product) and p240 (carboxyl terminal product; Figure 1B ) (Denison et al, 1992 Weiss et al, 1994) . The electrophoretic mobility of p290 is consistent with the predicted molecular weight (278 kDa) of the polypeptide encoded between the C-terminus of p65 and the C-terminus of HD1 (Figure 1) . A role for PLP-1 in the production of p28 and p65 has been demonstrated in vitro using various ORF1a cDNA clones (Baker et al, 1989 (Baker et al, , 1993 Bonilla et al, 1995 Bonilla et al, , 1997 Dong and Baker, 1994; Hughes et al, 1995) . The cleavage sites for p28 and p65 have been identi ed between Gly-247 and Bonilla et al, 1994; Lee et al, 1991. b Cleavage occurs between P1 and P1 0 residues. c Amino acid residues in pp1a. d Cleavage proposed to occur between P1 and P1 0 residues. Bonilla et al, 1997; Schiller et al, 1998. Val-248 and between Ala-832 and Gly-833, respectively ( Figure 1A and Table 1 ; Bonilla et al, 1997; Dong and Baker, 1994; Hughes et al, 1995) . In contrast, p50 production has not been detected under in vitro conditions (Baker et al, 1989; Denison and Perlman, 1986; Bonilla et al, 1995 Bonilla et al, , 1997 ; this has made the further study of the p50 polypeptide difcult. It could be that under the in vitro conditions used, the polypeptide substrate adopted a conformation that prevented PLP-1 access to the p50 site. This would be similar to the observation that p65 production was not detected in vitro unless an ORF1a deletion construct was used as template . We proposed a consensus recognition sequence for PLP-1 cleavage (Table 1) based on sequence comparisons and in vitro mutagenesis studies with the p28 and p65 cleavage sites in MHV-A59 and MHV strain JHM (MHV-JHM). We further predicted that in MHV-A59 pp1a, the sequence from Lys-1258 to Ala-1263 conforms to this consensus, with cleavage between Ala-1262 and Ala-1263 (see Figure 1A and Table 1 ). Cleavage at this predicted site (and at the carboxyl terminus of p65) would result in a 47.4-kDa polypeptide, which has similar molecular mass to p50 detected in MHV-A59-infected cells (Denison et al, 1992) . Because the proposed cleavage site is located between the catalytic Cys-1121 and His-1272 residues of PLP-1, we speculated that cleavage at this site could provide a mechanism for PLP-1 to autoregulate its activity in vivo. At present, there is no direct evidence for this type of autoregulation in the replication of any coronavirus; thus this remains an hypothesis to be tested.\n\nInterestingly, in spite of similar amino acid sequences between MHV-A59 and MHV-JHM , the proteolytic processing patterns of pp1a are not identical between these two strains. In MHV-JHM-infected cells, pp1a is processed to produce p28, p65, and p250 (with similar gel mobility to p290 in MHV-A59), which was further proteolyzed to release p210 (with similar electrophoretic mobility to p250 in MHV-A59) and p40. The model of processing of the MHV-JHM pp1a, however, maps the end of p210 to the N-terminus of HD1 (Kanjanahaluethai and Baker, 2000) . Furthermore, it is not clear whether p40 in MHV-JHM pp1a has similar origin as p50 in MHV-A59 pp1a (Schiller et al, 1998) , nor more generally, whether these differences in the two proposed schemes are indeed strain-speci c or simply due to differences in apparent molecular weights assigned to these polypeptides. In addition, processing of MHV-JHM pp1a results in production of p72, identi ed to be a precursor of p65; which is not detected in MHV-A59infected cells ( Figure 1B ; Gao et al, 1996) . Schiller et al (1998) proposed that p72 resulted from cleavage between Gly-247 and Val-248 (at the amino terminus) and between Gly-904 and Val-905 (at the carboxyl terminus; Table 1 ). The authors further suggested that substitution of Gly-904 in MHV-JHM pp1a by an Asp in MHV-A59 pp1a results in lack of p72 production in MHV-A59-infected cells. The proteinase responsible for p72 production was not identi ed, but the predicted site is similar to a PLP-1 cleavage site (Table 1) (Schiller et al, 1998) . Recently, MHV-JHM PLP-2 has been demonstrated to cleave at the amino terminus of HD1, however, there are no data indicating a role for PLP-2 in p50 or p72 production (Kanjanahaluethai and Baker, 2000) .\n\nDoes the predicted p50 sequence results in PLP-1-mediated cleavage when placed in the position of the p28 cleavage site? Because p50 could not be detected by in vitro studies (Baker et al, 1989; Bonilla et al, 1995 Bonilla et al, , 1997 Denison and Perlman, 1986) , we investigated the proposed p50 cleavage sequence (Table 1 ; Bonilla et al, 1997) by introducing this sequence into the p28 site. The rationale for this approach is the observation that exchanging the P2, P1, and P1 0 residues of the p28 and p65 cleavage sequences with each other still results in cleavage at the mutated sites . Therefore, if the p50 cleavage sequence is recognized by PLP-1, then introducing this sequence into a more accessible region (the p28 site) might allow cleavage H Teng and SR Weiss to occur. Mutagenesis was performed using the PCRbased QuickChange kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol and as described previously (Teng et al, 1999) . To introduce the proposed p50 sequence into the p28 sequence, mutagenic primers were used to mutate pSPN 1 S 1 , which encodes pp1a sequence from Met-1 to Lys-1160 and could not undergo cis cleavage to produce p28 ( Figure 1A ; Teng et al, 1999) . pSPN 1 S 1 G247A/V248A has the P1 and P1 0 residues of the p28 sequence replaced by the corresponding residues of the proposed p50 sequence (Table 1) . pSPN 1 S 1 G244V/G247A/V248A contains an additional mutation at the P4 location. pSPN 1 S 1 Y245F/G247A/V248A has the P3, P1, and P1 0 residues of the p28 site replaced by those of the proposed p50 sequence. pSPN 1 S 1 G244V/Y245F/G247A/V248A has the P4, P3, P1, and P1 0 residues of the p28 site replaced. The constructs were used in in vitro transcription/translation with the TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) as described previously . Polypeptides translated from constructs described here were used as substrates and incubated with enzyme translated from pCITE P 1 P 2a (Teng et al, 1999) , which encodes both PLP domains (cleavage in trans). For negative control, enzyme was translated from pCITE P 1 P 2a H1272P, which is the same as pCITE P 1 P 2a except the PLP-1 domain contains an inactivating H1272P mutation (Teng et al, 1999) . Figure 2 shows that substitution of the P1 and P1 0 residues (with or without substitution of the P3 residue) of the p28 cleavage sequence by the corresponding residues of the proposed p50 sequence, results in p28 production (lanes 3 and 4, 7 and 8), comparable to that observed with substrate translated from wild-type pSPN 1 S 1 (lanes 1 and 2) . The absence of p28 production when substrates were incubated with polypeptides carrying inactive PLP-1 (odd numbered lanes indicated with minus signs in Figure 2) show that the observed cleavage was catalyzed by PLP-1. (Active PLP-2, also encoded in pCITE P 1 P 2a , was present in all reactions and was apparently unable to mediate cleavage when PLP-1 was inactivated.) Preliminary results also show that in vitro transcription and translation of a mutant construct, which has the P2 and P1 0 residues of the p65 site replaced by the corresponding residues of the proposed p50 sequence (Table 1) , produced similar proteolytic products as the wild-type construct (data not shown), suggesting that the proposed p50 sequence ) may function to mediate cleavage when placed in the p65 cleavage site as well as the p28 cleavage site positions.\n\nSurprisingly, additional substitution at the P4 position of the p28 site (Gly-244; Table 1 ) by the corresponding residue of the proposed p50 sequence (Val ;  Table 1 ) abolished p28 production (Figure 2 , lanes 5 and 6, 9 and 10). The results imply that PLP-1 can recognize and cleave at the -Ala-Ala-dipeptide , the proposed P1 and P1 0 residues of the p50 sequence, provided the P4 residue is not a Val. Because mutagenesis studies of the p28 and p65 sites did not point to strict conservation at their P4 residues (Gly and Phe, respectively), the reason for the observed inhibition remains unclear. It could be that under our in vitro conditions, the G244V substitution (in addition to the substitutions at the P1 and P1 0 residues) speci cally reduced cleavage at the mutated cleavage site. Incidentally, previous studies on the p28 site also show that the G244V mutation resulted in lower level of p28 when compared to the G244D mutation . Alternatively, the presence of a Val at the P4 position could prevent unregulated cleavage (by PLP-1) at the natural p50 site in vivo. In support of this proposal, replacing the P2 to P1 0 residues of the proposed p50 sequence with the corresponding residues of the p28 cleavage sequence did not result in cleavage at the mutated region (results not shown), indicating that other factors, such as change in substrate conformation induced by a P4 Val, determine PLP-1 access to the proposed p50 site. If this were the case, then viral and/or host factors, not present in our in vitro conditions, would be required to maintain the substrate in a conformation that favors cleavage at the p50 site.\n\nOur data, to date, do not prove that the proposed p50 cleavage site is utilized during processing of pp1a in vivo. We must consider possible explanations for our results. For example, it is possible that the observed cleavage products derived from mutant constructs in Figure 2 (lanes 4 and 8) arise from cleavage at nearby unde ned sites (Table 1 ; Bonilla et al, 1997) ; the observed cleavage could be due to a relaxed speci city of PLP-1 at the p28 and p65 sites under our in vitro conditions (i.e., PLP-1-mediated cleavage could tolerate substitutions at the p28 and p65 sites by an -Ala-Ala-dipeptide) . However, if such nonspeci c cleavages within pp1a were to occur in vivo, then that could disrupt the regulation of proteolytic processing, thus compromising viral RNA synthesis and virus maturation. In results not presented, introducing the P2 to P1 0 residues of the p28 sequence, shown to play important roles in cleavage speci city (Baker et al, 1993; Hughes et al, 1995) , into a random location within pp1a (just upstream of the p28 cleavage site in a construct in which the authentic p28 site is inactivated), did not create a new cleavage site, providing further support to the assumption that cleavage by PLP-1 is both sequence-and location-speci c. Thus, to determine under what conditions, and if so, cleavage at the p50 site may indeed occur, further experiments must be carried out. These would include immunoprecipitation experiments using antisera speci c against sequences within the PLP-1 domain, the isolation and characterizatio n of p50 from infected cells, and mutagenesis studies (e.g., with additional substitutions at the P4 Val residue in the proposed p50 cleavage site). 1 and 2) , pSPN 1 S 1 G247A/V248A (243 -K-G-Y-R-A#A-K-249) (lanes 3 and 4) , pSPN 1 S 1 G244V/G247A/V248A (243 -K-V-Y-R-A/A-K-249) (lanes 5 and 6), pSPN 1 S 1 Y245F/G247A/V248A (243 -K-G-F-R-A#A-K-249) (lanes 7 and 8), and pSPN 1 S 1 G244V/Y245F/G247A/V248A (243 -K-V-F-R-A/A-K-249) (lanes 9 and 10). (The arrow within the sequences indicates that cleavage does occur with the addition of active PLP-1, whereas the slash indicates cleavage does not occur in the presence of active PLP-1.) Substrates were then incubated with inactive PLP-1 transcribed and translated in vitro from pCITE P 1 P 2a H1272P (\u00a1lanes), or with active PLP-1 transcribed and translated in vitro from pCITE P 1 P 2a (Clanes). The cleavage products were electrophoresed on an SDS-12.5% polyacrylamide gel. The molecular masses of marker proteins are indicated on the right. The location of p28 is indicated. In lane 7, the protein band with mobility similar to p28 migrates faster than the authentic p28 and is not a cleavage product.\n\nThe putative JHM p72 cleavage recognition sequence is not cleaved by PLP-1 when introduced into A59 pp1a. Previously we reported that in vitro transcription and translation of pSPNK1MAG D904G, which contains the predicted p72 cleavage sequence of MHV-JHM (with the D904G mutation), but has the p65 cleavage site dipeptide of MHV-A59 deleted; did not result in production of p72 (Teng et al, 1999) . In this work we further examined the proposed p72 site by constructing pSPNK1Msc D904G, which introduced the D904G mutation into MHV-A59 pp1a while retaining a functional p65 site. The construct was transcribed and translated in vitro as described before . Aliquots were withdrawn at indicated times and the reactions quenched with 4 mM leupeptin (Denison and Perlman, 1986) . Results in Figure 3A show that when pSPNK1Msc D904G was transcribed and translated in vitro, p28, p43, and p70 (resulting from cleavage at wild-type p28 and p65 sites) were detected. When rabbit antiserum UP102 (directed against pp1a Met-1 to Gln-592; Denison et al, 1995) was used to immunoprecipitate the cleavage products transcribed and translated in vitro from pSPNK1Msc D904G, only p28, p43, and p70 were detected ( Figure 3B ). There is no evidence for additional proteolytic product resulting from cleavage at the mutated site such as the predicted 77-kDa polypeptide, which would have been immunoprecipitated as well. Results in Figure 3C show that substitutions of the P2, P1, and P1 0 residues of the p65 site with the corresponding residues of the predicted p72 sequence (Table 1 ) did not result in cleavage at the mutated p65 site (lane 3), in contrast to the wild-type construct (lane 1; Bonilla et al, 1995) and similar substitutions by the p28 sequence (lane 2; Bonilla et al, 1997) . Gao et al (1996) initially suggested that p72 synthesis was mediated by 3CLpro, with cleavage between Glu-894 and Ser-895. Although cleavage between a Glu and a Ser has been reported for equine arterivirus virus, an arterivirus, this cleavage site has not been reported for MHV 3CLpro (Gorbalenya and Snijder, 1996; de Vries et al, 1997 ; also see Liu et al, 1997; Pi\u00f1\u00f3n et al, 1997; and van Dinten et al, 1999) . Subsequently, Schiller et al (1998) suggested that the p72 cleavage site occurs between Gly-904 and Val-905, similar to the p28 cleavage site (Table 1) . (Denison and Perlman, 1986) . The products were separated on an SDS-12.5% polyacrylamide gel. Molecular masses of marker proteins are indicated on the right side. Locations of p28, p43, and p70 are indicated by arrows. (B) Immunoprecipitation of cis cleavage reactions. Substrate transcribed and translated in vitro from pSPNK1Msc D904G was immunoprecipitated with UP102 according to Bonilla et al (1995) . Cleavage products were separated on an SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel. Locations of p28, p43, and p70 are indicated by arrows. (C) Replacing the p65 cleavage site by the proposed p72 sequence did not result in cleavage. Cis cleavage reactions were carried out with substrates transcribed and translated in vitro from pSPNK1Msc (with the sequence 828 -F-R-P-C-A#G-K-834, arrow indicates cleavage occurs; lane 1) , pSPNK1Msc C831R/A832G/G833V (828 -F-R-P-R-G#V-K-834; lane 2) , and pSPNK1Msc C831H/A832G/G833V (828 -F-R-P-H-G/V-K-834; lane 3). Cleavage products were separated on an SDS-12.5% polyacrylamide gel. Molecular masses of marker proteins are indicated on the right. Locations of p28, p43, and p70 are indicated by arrows.\n\nHowever, in the putative p72 cleavage sequence the P5 residue is a Cys instead of a basic residue, and does not conform to the proposed consensus sequence (Table 1) . Nevertheless, our experimental results cannot rule out the possibility that strain speci c differences allow cleavage at the p72 site within MHV-JHM pp1a. Possibly, under in vivo conditions, MHV-JHM pp1a adopts a conformation that enables PLP-1 to access the proposed p72 site. It is also possible that the PLP-1 of JHM has the ability to cleave at the proposed p72 site while the PLP-1 encoded by A59 does not; this seems unlikely as the PLP-1 domain is highly conserved between the two strains of virus (Lee et al, 1991; Bonilla et al, 1994) . Currently, our experimental results support neither the proposed p72 sequence nor its proposed location.\n\nIn conclusion, the in vitro data presented here showed that substitutions of the P2 to P1 0 residues of the p28 or p65 site by the corresponding residues of the predicted p50 cleavage site can support cleavage at the mutated p28 and p65 sites, in agreement with our proposed p50 cleavage sequence. As the predicted p50 site (Table 1) is located between the catalytic residues of PLP-1 (Cys-1121 and His-1272), the virus can regulate in vivo proteinase activity (hence viral genome replication) through self inactivation of PLP-1 . On the other hand, the lack of p50 production in cells infected with MHV-JHM hints that MHV-JHM may regulate PLP-1 activity differently from MHV-A59. It is possible that differences in proteolytic processing of pp1a between MHV-A59 and MHV-JHM could contribute to differences in the biology of these two strains. However, to study the full effects of these processing events in vivo, we must await methods to introduce the various mutations into the genome (Yount et al, 2000) . It is hoped that integration of the in vivo and in vitro data can help us to gain greater insight into the complex proteolytic processing events of coronavirus, and providing us a guide to rational antiviral drug design.\n\nBaker SC, Yokomori K, Dong S, Carlisle R, Gorbalenya AE, Koonin EV, Lai MMC (1993) .
