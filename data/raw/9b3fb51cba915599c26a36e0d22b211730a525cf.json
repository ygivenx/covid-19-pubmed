For market data, we conducted a literature review of previous surveys using 85 two comparative approaches to analyze how species on offer may have changed over time. For recent 86 online data, we report our findings on online trade in raptor over a two-year data monitoring period, 87 collecting information on species on offer and asking prices. First, we made a comparison based on 88 trade platform, i.e. market (data from physical brick-and-mortar markets) and online (e-commerce and 89 social media platforms) surveys. Secondly, we made a temporal comparison, using the 'Internet era' 90 as a defining marker: pre-Internet (before 1995) and post-Internet (after 1995). We defined the start of 91 the Internet Era as the year 1995 as in that year for the first time computers outsold TV sets (Newell 92 2001). We created models to explain the variability in the number and composition of the species in 93 trade, using predictor variables such as body size (wingspan), clutch size, migratory status, and 94 conservation status. Using data on asking prices from our two-year study, we explored the above 95 listed variable to explain variation in price and to analyse temporal trends and seasonality. Based on 96 our findings, we recommend increased monitoring, and improved legal protection and enforcement 97 for species. English. We joined every group that could be searched and found by anyone with a Facebook 117 account. In some cases, the group status may be closed and therefore we required approval to enter. GLMs and associated p-values. In the meta-analysis, we conducted analyses at a species level. We 204 incorporated factors that may explain availability using the same variables in Table 1. 205 206 (Table 1) 207 208\n\nThe raptor trade in Thailand is summarized using data from four surveys were conducted in 210 physical bird markets and two surveys on online trade platforms (Table 2) \n\nWe ran a GLM using price data on our data based on the 24-month data, to explain price using 244 factors of body size (wingspan), clutch size, IUCN trend, migratory status as model variables and 245 number of individuals as a weighted factor. We found that in our best fit model, all variables were significant factors to explain price (Table 4a) . Clutch size correlated inversely with both availability 247 and price. Based on the model, species that have decreasing trends on the IUCN Red-list and are 248 migratory were offered at higher estimated means prices.\n\nWe also modelled using availability (physical markets and online platforms) as a dependent 250 factor, and factors of body size (wingspan), clutch size, IUCN Trend (stable or decreasing), and 251 migratory status as variables. In the best fit model, the availability in physical markets could be 252 significantly explained by wingspan, where higher numbers of smaller birds were found traded (Table   253 4b-c). In the best fit model for online surveys, we find that wingspan, clutch size (more frequently for "}
