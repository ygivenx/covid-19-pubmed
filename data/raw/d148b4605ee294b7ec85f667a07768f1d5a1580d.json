{"title": "Detection of Viruses By Counting Single Fluorescent Genetically Biotinylated Reporter Immunophage Using a Lateral Flow Assay", "body": "Reducing infection and mortality rates from viral pathogens, such as dengue 1 and Ebola viruses 2 , requires rapid and early diagnosis. This need poses a special challenge in economically challenged areas with limited laboratory infrastructure where these viruses are often endemic. Early diagnosis under these conditions is aided by point-of-care (POC) diagnostics 3 that are able to detect viruses at low concentrations and without involved sample preparation. Traditional techniques for detecting viruses, including plaque assays and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), [4] [5] often require complex laboratory equipment and trained personnel and are therefore poorly suited for early diagnosis in these settings.\n\nLateral flow assays (LFAs) are a rapid, cheap, and simple option for POC diagnosis. 6 In a typical LFA format, a biological sample containing an analyte is dispensed onto the sample pad of a porous membrane strip and transported through it by capillary action; antibodies bound to the membrane capture the analytes as they flow through the strip. Reporter particles also transported by the flow are then analyte-bridged and arrested by antibodies at the test line to produce an easily discernible line on the strip as a positive result. LFAs using gold, dyed latex, or carbon nanoparticles as reporters require minimal sample preparation and hence are routinely used in research and clinical applications. 7 Traditional nanoparticlebased LFAs 6-8 , however, typically cannot detect viral antigens at concentrations in clinically-useful ranges (e.g. 10 3 -10 6 viral particles per mL for HIV-1 9 , 10 1 -10 6 plaque forming units per mL for Ebola 10 , and 10 1 -10 4 plaque forming units per mL for dengue 11 ) due to limited readout; for example, colloidal gold LFAs for Japanese encephalitis virus can detect viruses at a concentration of 2.5 \u00d7 10 6 pfu/mL 12 and filamentous Escherichia coli M13 bacteriophage (phage) at a concentration of 5 \u00d7 10 7 pfu/mL. 13 By contrast, complex laboratory methods such as plaque counting and polymerase chain reaction have much lower limits of detection. [4] [5] For LFAs to be most useful as early diagnostics for viral diseases, new reporter technologies are needed with increased sensitivity and decreased limits of detection.\n\nAn intriguing alternative to the nanoparticles conventionally used as LFA reporters are viral nanoparticles, such as bacteriophage. Phage surfaces can be genetically and chemically engineered to display a wide range of functional groups, including antibodies, aptamers, lectins, peptides, proteins, and enzymes, 14-15 enabling recognition and readout. This property allows engineered phage to serve as universal biodetection reporters in diagnostic assays, [16] [17] [18] [19] including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) 20-23 and colorimetric LFAs. 24 In addition, phage bearing fluorescent moieties have been employed in a variety of biodetection assays that use flow cytometry [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] or fluorescence microscopy 27, 30-31 as readouts. Such fluorescently-labeled phage are of particular interest for use in LFAs, as many phage (e.g. M13, T7) are large enough to be imaged using optical microscopy as diffraction-limited objects when labeled with fluorescent dyes [32] [33] and hence can be singly counted using automated image-processing routines. 34 We therefore posited that the combination of coat protein engineering and fluorescence could enable a new LFA readout, in which phage reporters bound to analytes are singly counted, that may increase LFA sensitivity.\n\nHere, we report a lateral-flow immunoassay based on enumerating individual fluorescently labeled bacteriophage reporters. We first developed a protocol to fluorescently label the p8 major coat proteins of M13, and then functionalized the p3 tail protein displaying a biotinylatable AviTag peptide with antibodies to MS2, a widely used model for viral pathogens. At each step in the protocol we confirmed that reporters were successfully modified using ELISA, 4\u2032-hydroxyazobenzene-2-carboxylic acid (HABA) assay, and a magnetic particle counting assay. In the LFA, Fusion 5 membranes were functionalized with test and control lines that contain antibodies to MS2 and to the M13 reporter, respectively, as shown in Figure 1 . Defined numbers of MS2 phage were flowed through the LFA matrix  and captured at the test line, which contained anti-MS2 antibodies. Fluorescent M13  reporters functionalized with anti-MS2 antibodies subsequently flowed through the strip  were captured by the MS2 on the test line and by anti-M13 antibodies on the control line. We acquired fluorescence micrographs at the test, transition, and control lines and used automated image-processing algorithms to count the number of reporter phage at each location at the single-label level. The limit of detection (LoD) of this assay, determined from the 95% confidence intervals on the number of counted M13 reporters, is 10 2 plaqueforming units (pfu) in a 10 Jl sample deposited onto the sample pad at the end of the LFA strip, lower than that reported for colloidal-gold LFAs for viruses [12] [13] or an ELISA for MS2 virus 35 . We anticipate that the imaging assay developed here can be integrated with inexpensive detection technologies, including paper microfluidics [36] [37] and smartphonebased fluorescence imaging, [38] [39] to enable point-of-care rapid diagnostics for viruses in resource-limited settings.\n\nMS2 virus (ATCC, #15597-B1) and its E. coli host strain (ATCC, #15597) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). AviTag-displaying M13 phage (AviTag-M13) were a gift from Prof. Brian Kay at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The culturing and titering of MS2 and M13 phage were performed as described in Reference 21.\n\nAviTag-M13 were modified with AlexaFluor 555 Carboxylic Acid (Succinimidyl Ester, Life Technologies #A-20009) as illustrated in Figure 2 . This amine-reactive AlexaFluor 555 was conjugated to the primary amines of the p8 major coat proteins of AviTag-M13. PEG precipitation of AviTag-M13 was performed to replace the buffer in the stock solution with 0.2 M sodium bicarbonate at pH 8.3 as the optimum reaction buffer for fluorescent labeling. For PEG precipitation, 100 \u03bcL of 10 12 pfu/mL AviTag-M13 was mixed with 20 \u03bcL of PEG/ NaCl (20% w/v PEG 8000/2.5 M NaCl), and incubated on ice for 1 h. The PEG solution was then centrifuged at 11,000 \u00d7 g for 20 min at room temperature and the AviTag-M13 pellet was resuspended in 100 \u03bcL of 0.2 M sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.3. Next, 5 \u03bcL of 10 mg/mL AlexaFluor 555 was added to the AviTag-M13 solution, and the solution was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C on a shaker in the dark. To terminate the labeling reaction, 10 \u03bcL of 1.5 M hydroxylamine at pH 8.5 was added to the AviTag-M13 solution and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. To remove free Alexa molecules, PEG precipitation and 7 KDa molecular weight cut-off Zeba TM spin desalting columns (Thermo Scientific #89877) were used. 100 \u03bcL of 10 12 /mL AviTag-FluorM13 were stored in the dark at 4\u00b0C until used.\n\nAviTag-M13 phage display a peptide on the p3 tail protein which can serve as a substrate for E. coli biotin ligase and is inherently biotinylated at greater than 50% efficiency when grown in an E. coli host that contains the pBirA plasmid. 40 We completed the biotinylation in vitro using E. coli biotin ligase (birA), according to the manufacturer's instructions (Avidity AviTag TM Technology) or using biotin ligase produced in-house. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature in the dark, excess biotinylation reagents were removed from the biotinylated FluorM13 (Biotin-FluorM13) solution via PEG precipitation and a 7K MWCO Zeba TM spin desalting column.\n\n100 \u03bcL of a 10 12 pfu/mL Biotin-FluorM13 solution was mixed with 10 \u03bcL of 0.1 mg/mL neutravidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific #31000), and the resulting solution was incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. To remove excess neutravidin, the solution was dialyzed for 20 h against 1 liter of PBS using a Float-A-Lyzer 100K MWCO dialysis device (Spectra/Por #G235035) with five complete buffer changes during the dialysis.\n\nRabbit Anti-MS2 antibodies (Tetracore, #TC-7004-002) were biotinylated using EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC Biotin (Thermo Scientific #21335) following the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, 10 \u03bcL of 2.8 mg/mL anti-MS2 antibody solution was mixed with 20 \u03bcL of 0.1 mg/mL EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC Biotin and 90 \u03bcL of PBS. The solution was then incubated for 30 min at room temperature. A 7K MWCO Zeba TM spin desalting column was used to remove excess biotin.\n\n10 \u03bcL of 0.23 mg/mL biotinylated anti-MS2 antibodies were mixed with 990 \u03bcL of 1.1 \u00d7 10 11 pfu/mL neutravidin-functionalized FluorM13 in PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Excess biotinylated anti-MS2 antibody was removed using a Float-A-Lyzer 300K MWCO dialysis device with five complete buffer changes during the dialysis.\n\nA HABA assay (Thermo Scientific, #28005) was used to estimate the biotin/antibody ratio of biotinylated anti-MS2 antibody (additional details are given in the Supporting Information). From the difference between the absorbance of HABA/Avidin solution and that of a HABA/Avidin/Biotinylated-anti-MS2 antibody mixture measured at 500 nm, a ratio of biotin to anti-MS2 antibody of 3.1 was estimated using the analytical formula provided by the manufacturer.\n\nThe degrees of biotinylation of AviTag-FluorM13 and Biotin-FluorM13 were compared using TMB (3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-Tetramethylbenzidine)-ELISA. Additional details on the ELISA protocol can be found in Supporting Information.\n\nWe assessed the conjugation of rabbit anti-MS2 antibodies onto FluorM13 using ELISA. The ELISA plate was coated with 100 \u03bcL of 5 \u03bcg/mL anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, #R4880) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. The plate wells were washed and rinsed four times each with PBST and PBS, respectively, and blocked with 300 \u03bcL of 2% (w/v) BSA in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. 100 \u03bcL of rabbit anti-MS2 antibody-functionalized FluorM13 at concentrations of 0, 10 8 , 10 9 , and 10 10 pfu/mL were added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature; for the negative control experiment, AviTag-FluorM13 with no antibody was added to the wells. Bound antibody-functionalized FluorM13 were allowed to react with 100 \u03bcL of HRP-conjugated anti-M13 antibody (1:5,000 dilution in 2% (w/v) BSA in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by washing and rinsing. To develop the color, 50 \u03bcL of TMB was added to the plate for 10 min, after which the reaction was terminated by addition of 50 \u03bcL of 2 N H 2 SO 4 . Absorbance was measured at 450 nm in the ELISA reader.\n\nCarboxylated magnetic particles (1 \u03bcm diameter, Thermo Scientific, #4515-2105-050350) were coated with anti-M13 antibody, neutravidin, biotinylated-BSA, or anti-rabbit antibody using standard 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide\u00b7HCl-N-Hydroxylsuccinimide (EDC-NHS) coupling. To pre-activate magnetic particles for protein coupling, we mixed 200 \u03bcL of a 5% (w/v) solution of magnetic particles with 230 \u03bcL of 50 mg/mL NHS and 230 \u03bcL of 42 mg/mL EDC in 50 mM of MES buffer at pH 6 and diluted to 1 mL by adding 340 \u03bcL of 50 mM MES buffer. The mixture was incubated for 30 min on a rotator at room temperature. The particles were washed using a magnetic stand with 50 mM of MES buffer once and PBS twice and briefly sonicated after each wash. The magnetic particles were then resuspended in 1 mL of PBS. 100 \u03bcL of 1% EDC-NHS preactivated magnetic particles were mixed with 100 \u03bcL of one of the protein solutions (0.56 mg/mL anti-MS2 antibody, 1.5 mg/mL neutravidin, 1.5 mg/mL biotinylated-BSA, or 0.5 mg/mL anti-rabbit antibody). After 1 h incubation on a rotator at room temperature, magnetic particles were washed with PBS three times and briefly sonicated after each wash. For the first quenching step, magnetic particles were resuspended in 200 \u03bcL of 0.1 M hydroxylamine in PBS, and incubated for 1 h on a rotator at room temperature. Magnetic particles were washed with PBS three times and resuspended in 200 \u03bcL of 2% (w/v) BSA in PBS for the second quenching step. After overnight incubation, magnetic particles were washed and then resuspended with 200 \u03bcL of 0.1 % (w/v) BSA in PBS and 0.005% ProClin \u00ae 300 preservative (SUPELCO, #48126).\n\n10 \u03bcL of a solution of protein-functionalized magnetic particles at a concentration of 1.36 \u00d7 10 8 particles per mL, equal to 0.01% (w/v), was mixed with 50 \u03bcL of a solution of functionalized FluorM13 at a concentration of 10 11 pfu/mL. The mixture was incubated on a slow shaker for 1 h at room temperature in the dark and then washed six times with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS using a magnetic stand. The particles were then resuspended in 30 \u03bcL PBS. The particle solution was pipetted into a well chamber that was formed by placing a silicon isolator (Grace Bio-Labs, Bend, OR; size: 4.5 mm diameter \u00d7 1.7 mm depth) on the coverslip. A magnet was put under the coverslip for 10 sec to pull the particles down to the coverslip surface. A light microscope (Leica, DMI 3000B) equipped with a 100\u00d7 oil immersion objective lens (NA 1.4) was used to image particles in both fluorescence and brightfield modes. To detect AlexaFluor 555 using fluorescence microscopy, samples were illuminated with a 120 W mercury lamp through a filter cube consisting of an excitation filter (BP 515-560 nm), a dichromatic mirror (580 nm), and a suppression filter (LP 590 nm). A back-thinned frame transfer CCD camera (Hamamatsu, C9100-12) was used to capture images with a 0.3 sec shutter speed. We acquired twenty pairs of brightfield and fluorescence micrographs of magnetic particles at the same focal area. Using an automated counting program ( Figure S1 in Supporting Information), we counted all particles in the brightfield micrographs and the bright particles that bore bound FluorM13 in the fluorescence micrographs. We examined ~5,000 particles across each set of twenty images and calculated the fraction of bright particles by dividing the number of bright particles by the total number of particles.\n\nFusion 5 strips (1 mm \u00d7 50 mm \u00d7 110 \u03bcm, GE Healthcare & Life Sciences #8151-9915) were modified with 1 \u03bcL of 0.43 mg/mL rabbit anti-M13 antibody and 1 \u03bcL of 0.56 mg/mL rabbit anti-MS2 antibody in 50 mM acetate buffer at pH 3.6 by hand-spotting at control and test lines, respectively. MS2 virus samples were prepared with six time-serial dilutions in LFA buffer (10% BSA and 30% glycerol in PBS) at concentrations of 10 7 , 10 6 , 10 5 , 10 4 , 10 3 , 10 2 , and 0 pfu/mL. In the first step of the assay, 10 \u03bcL of each MS2 virus sample was dispensed onto the sample pad at one end of an LFA strip. Each strip was washed with 200 \u03bcL of washing buffer (0.1% Tween-20, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS). Next, 10 \u03bcL of 10 8 pfu/mL anti-MS2 antibody-functionalized FluorM13 in LFA buffer was dispensed onto the sample pad. Each strip was washed and rinsed with 200 \u03bcL of washing buffer and 100 \u03bcL of PBS, respectively, to remove non-specifically bound M13 reporters. After drying in air for 1 h, the strips were immersed with pure glycerol to match the refractive index of the Fusion 5 membrane. FluorM13 reporters bound to strips were imaged using a Leica DMI 3000B fluorescence microscope equipped with a 63\u00d7 oil immersion objective lens (NA 1.4). Micrographs were acquired at the test, transition, and control lines using a back-thinned frame transfer CCD camera (Hamamatsu, C9100-12) and analyzed using automated imageprocessing routines.\n\nTo implement an imaging-based LFA format we developed novel reporter agents, fluorescent antibody-functionalized bacteriophage that were able to specifically bind to an analyte virus and were readily imaged at the single-reporter level using fluorescence microscopy. M13 bacteriophage modified to express the AviTag peptide were first fluorescently labeled with AlexaFluor 555 and subsequently conjugated with antibodies to MS2, as shown in Figure 2 . Individual fluorescently-conjugated phage were readily imaged using fluorescence microscopy ( Figure 3a ). Subsequently, we enzymatically biotinylated the AviTag peptide and confirmed biotinylation using a TMB-ELISA assay. The absorbance of biotin-conjugated FluorM13 on a neutravidin-coated plate was higher than that of the AviTag FluorM13 prior to conjugation, confirming that the FluorM13 phage were successfully biotinylated (Figure 3b ). We prepared anti-MS2 antibodies with a ratio of 3.1 biotins per antibody and confirmed that the anti-MS2 antibodies were retained on the FluorM13 phages by ELISA (Figure 3c ).\n\nTo further verify each of the FluorM13 functionalization steps, we employed a magnetic bead assay (Figure 4) . We mixed magnetic particles functionalized with a variety of proteins with FluorM13 phage bearing biotin, neutravidin, or antibodies to the model virus MS2 and counted the fraction of magnetic particles that were fluorescent, signifying binding of the phage (additional details are given in the Supporting Information). For each pair of particle and phage surface chemistries, the fluorescence signal was consistent with that expected from the surface chemistries. In pairs in which specific binding was expected (e.g. between a magnetic particle functionalized with antibodies to M13 and any of the FluorM13 phage, Figure 4a , b and c) a large fraction of magnetic particles were fluorescent, confirming good binding between phage and particles. Conversely, in those cases in which specific binding was not expected (e.g. between biotin-functionalized particles and biotin-conjugated FluorM13 phage, Figure 4g ) few magnetic particles were fluorescent, confirming that the phage did not bind non-specifically to the particles. We attributed the affinity of the anti-MS2 Ab FluorM13 phage for neutravidin-coated magnetic particles (Figure 4f) to the presence of excess biotins on the anti-MS2 antibody, which may bind to the neutravidin on the particles.\n\nTo efficiently quantify the number of reporter phage bound to the LFA strip, we developed and employed an automated algorithm that locates and counts the number of the fluorescent phage in fluorescence micrographs ( Figure 5 ; additional details on image processing methods are given in Supporting Information). The software enhanced the image contrast and increased the ratio of signal to noise, allowing phage to be counted even against a noisy or unevenly illuminated background. In addition, the image processing preserved the nonspherical shape of the FluorM13 phage, which helps to confirm their identity and allows their orientation when bound to the strip to be determined.\n\nTo demonstrate the efficacy of our assay we chose as the analyte MS2 virus, which often serves as a model for viral pathogens. We deposited 10 \u03bcL of a solution containing a known concentration of MS2 on a sample pad at one end of antibody-functionalized LFA strips. Capillary action transported the MS2 viruses through the strip to the test line, where anti-MS2 antibodies captured them. Anti-MS2 Ab Fluor M13 reporters subsequently transported through the strip were captured both by the MS2 viruses bound to the matrix at the test line in a sandwich and by anti-M13 antibodies at a downstream control line. The uniformly bright micrographs acquired at the control line indicated that many M13 reporters were transported through the strip (Figure 6, top row) .\n\nIndividual bright spots in micrographs acquired upstream at the test line ( Figure 6 , bottom row) or in a non-functionalized transition region between the test and control lines ( Figure 6 , middle row) corresponded to individual M13 reporters bound to the strip. Resolving individual reporters required matching the refractive index of the Fusion 5 strip (n \u2248 1.5) to the solvent, here pure glycerol. Without index matching, scattering from the strip limited our ability to resolve single phages. The low number of bound phage in the transition area at each concentration compared to the test line indicated that non-specific binding did not increase with increasing analyte concentration.\n\nTo determine the limit of detection of the imaging LFA, we quantified the number of reporters bound at the test line and in the transition region using the automated imageprocessing program summarized in Figure 5 . The average number of bound reporters per micrograph acquired at the test line increased with increasing concentration of analyte MS2 viruses (Figure 7) but at a rate that was significantly less than linear: as the MS2 concentration was increased from 10 2 to 10 7 pfu per 10 \u03bcL, the number of bound phage increased by a factor of 5. The lack of proportionality between signal and offered analyte concentration, also observed in other assays with phage reporters, 19, 24 likely arose from steric hindrance and the great heterogeneity of the binding sites offered by the LFA matrix. The number of bound reporters in the transition area, by contrast, remained constant and independent of analyte concentration. The average number of bound reporters at the test and transition regions was different at a significance level of p < 0.05 for all analyte concentrations tested down to 10 2 pfu per 10 \u03bcL, corresponding to a titer of 10 4 pfu/mL ( Table 1 in Supporting Information). Additionally, the 95% confidence intervals for samples with nonzero MS2 concentration down to 10 2 pfu per 10 \u03bcL, indicated by the notches in Figure 7 , did not overlap with that of the zero MS2 concentration at the test line. Using as the criterion for the limit of detection the lack of overlap in the 95% confidence intervals of the number of bound M13 reporters, these results suggested that this assay could be used to detect as few as 10 2 pfu per 10 \u03bcL. An independent replicate of the assay exhibited an identical limit of detection ( Figure S4 in Supporting Information). We concluded that the limit of detection of this assay was ~10 2 pfu/strip. This LoD was approximately onehundred-fold better than that reported for virus LFAs using gold nanoparticles as reporters [12] [13] and that reported for an ELISA 35 for MS2.\n\nWe report here a lateral flow immunoassay for viruses that employs fluorescently-labeled M13 bacteriophage as reporters. This assay relies on the fact that individual filamentous phage can be resolved and hence counted using standard fluorescence microscopy. The limit of detection for our imaging LFA was significantly better than that of conventional LFAs using gold nanoparticles [12] [13] and that of an ELISA for MS2 35 , due in part to the resolution attained by imaging individual reporters bound to single analyte viruses.\n\nWe expect that the LoD can be lowered further by reducing nonspecific binding of the reporters in the background region and by optimizing the deposition of the test line to maximally concentrate the antibodies there. Additionally, we anticipate that tuning the chemistry and geometry of the LFA strip may further improve the LoD. An ideal strip for this assay allows easy transport of the reporters to all antibody-functionalized sites and aids capture of the reporters; in future work we therefore plan to vary the strip material as well as the size and arrangement of the pores therein. Finally, because reporters must be readily transported throughout the strip, we surmise that the shape of the reporter phage may affect the LoD; to test this idea, we will test the efficacy of functionalized viral nanoparticles of varying morphologies as reporters in this assay.\n\nWe envision that the imaging-based LFA described here can be integrated with other advances in detection to generate a simple and inexpensive diagnostic for viruses that is suitable for point-of-care applications. Adapting our LFA into a paper microfluidics format has the potential to reduce the number of handling steps and decrease costs, and would thus be promising for use in areas with few trained medical workers 43 . Fluorescence has already enabled multiplexed detection in a variety of modified LFAs 44 and multiplexed fluorescence imaging is easy to implement in our assay format. Similarly, combining our LFA with smartphone-based imaging methods 39, 45 , which have already been used to image individual viruses 38 , would generate a portable diagnostic. Moreover, recent advances in 3-D printing have demonstrated smartphone-compatible imaging systems that can magnify at 1,000x (the magnification used in this study), and cost less than a dollar for all materials 46 , compatible with point-of-care diagnostics in resource-limited settings.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.\n\nAnti-M13 and anti-MS2 antibodies were hand-spotted on Fusion 5 strips to generate test and control lines, respectively. The MS2 viruses were dispensed onto distal end of strips that were then washed in buffer. The FluorM13 reporters were spotted on the strips to sandwich MS2 viruses at the test line. Fluorescence micrographs were acquired at the test line, transition, and control line and analyzed using automated-image-processing routines to count the FluorM13 reporters. FluorM13 functionalized with biotin, neutravidin, anti-MS2 antibody were captured by anti-M13 antibody-magnetic particles (a, b and c). Neutravidin magnetic particles showed high binding affinity with Biotin-FluorM13 (d). The affinity between neutravidin-magnetic particles and anti-MS2 Ab FluorM13 (f) was ascribed to excess biotins on the biotinylated anti-MS2 antibody based on the result of the HABA assay. The third (g, h and i) and fourth (j, k and l) rows showed that biotin-FluorM13 undergo successful neutravidin and anti-MS2 Ab conjugation, respectively. The bar graphs showed the fraction of fluorescence magnetic particles bearing bound FluorM13, corresponding to the representative micrographs. Error bars were standard deviations from twenty images analyzed for each pair of magnetic particles and modified FluorM13. All images were acquired with identical imaging conditions (camera gain = 8, camera exposure time = 0.3 sec, 100\u00d7 objective lens). For each concentration of MS2/strip, two fluorescence micrographs acquired at the control (top; saturated white), transition (middle), and test (bottom) lines are shown. Each micrograph was of dimension 130 \u00d7 130 Jm 2 and the area of the antibody spotted onto Fusion 5 strips was ~ 1 mm 2 , so that at most sixty micrographs could be acquired from each antibody spot at a two dimensional plane. In the assay, twenty micrographs were acquired at the control, transition, and test lines of an LFA strip. We observed high fluorescence intensity at the control lines, leading to the bright white images. Although individual FluorM13 reporters cannot be distinguished at the control line, the high fluorescence intensity showed that sufficient FluorM13 reporters migrate along the length of the strip. The number of FluorM13 reporters bound at the test line increased with increasing number of MS2 per strip, and remained invariant at the transition area. further downstream from the test line). Strips were loaded with 10 JL MS2 virus solution at various concentrations. FluorM13 reporters were counted from twenty micrographs acquired for each MS2 virus concentration using an automated counting program. All test lines of LFA strips were distinguishable from the corresponding backgrounds at a statistical significance level of p < 0.05 using the t-test. The position of the notches indicated the 95% confidence interval; notches for images acquired at the test line for each the nonzero MS2 concentrations did not overlap with that for zero MS2 concentration."}
