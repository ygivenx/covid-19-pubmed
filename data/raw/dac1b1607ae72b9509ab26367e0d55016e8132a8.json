{"title": "Epidemic Situation of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia in China mainland", "body": "A novel coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan city, Hubei Province on December 1, 2019 [1] [2] .The novel coronavirus was temporarily named 2019-nCov by the World Health Organization on January 12, 2020[3]. On February 11, 2020, WHO Director-General announced that the novel coronavirus was officially named \"SARS-CoV-2\" On February 7, 2020, the Chinese Health and Health Commission temporarily named novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia as novel coronavirus pneumonia, abbreviated as\"NCP\" [4] . The NCP has been included in the B class infectious diseases stipulated in the law of the People's Republic of China on the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, and adopted measures for the prevention and control of Class A infectious diseases. According to the \"Diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia for novel coronavirus infection\" (revised version 5) , released by the Chinese health commission [5] , The incubation period is 1~14 days, generally 3~7 days. Fever, fatigue, dry cough as the main performance [6] .There is clear the route of transmission of respiratory droplet and contact transmission [7] , .

At present, there are no targeted treatment drugs, only symptomatic treatment [8] [9] .\n\nBecause NCP is a new infectious disease, human beings know little about the virus host, species, characteristics of the virus and its epidemiology etc. Therefore, the occurrence, epidemiology and prevention effect of the NCP were analyzed and discussed. It provides a scientific basis for the prevention and treatment of the NCP.\n\nThe data are from the official website of China Health and Health Committee and Hubei Health and Health Committee. From December 1, 2019 to February 14, 2020 [10] [11] , WPS software was used to analyze and summarize; WPS software and GraphPad Prism 6 software were used for mapping.\n\nThe first case of NCP was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province on December 1, 2019.

Eventually, trends suggest that the epidemic will be eliminated. people have been diagnosed with NCP in Hubei province, and more than 1,000 peoplehave been diagnosed with NCP in Guangzhou, Zhejiang, Henan and Hunan.\n\n.

From January 29, 2020, the cure rate of NCP rose in a wave trend. But the cure rate is still low.\n\n.

This index equal to 0, which means that the epidemic does not spread and there are no new cases; When the epidemic spread index is less than 1 and the number of infected diseases is small, the disease tends to die out; When the spread index is greater than 1, the disease continuous. the larger the spread index, the faster the spread of the epidemic. From the Figure 4 .A, It can be seen that the spread index of the NCP in China mainland has gradually decreased since January 27, 2020, indicating that the spread rate of the NCP is slowing down. It can be seen from the Figure 4 .B that the spread index of China mainland except Hubei province has gradually decreased since January 23, 2020;\n\nFrom January 21, 2020 to January 24, 2020, the spread index is around 100%, indicating that the novel coronavirus spreads rapidly in these four days.\n\nThe extinction index is the ratio of \"new cures and deaths\" to \"existing cases\" on that day. When the extinction index is greater than 1, the epidemic gradually disappears; and when the extinction index is larger, the epidemic dies faster; When the extinction index is less than 1; the epidemic will be go on for some time.

At the same time, it can be seen from figure B that in mainland China except Hubei province, from February 12, 2020, the extinction index is greater than 1, indicating the turning point of the NCP.\n\nAccording to the \"Epidemic update and risk assessment of 2019 Novel Coronavirus\" released by the Chinese center for disease control and prevention on January 28, 2020 [12] , the 2019 novel coronavirus is currently believed to be from wild animals, but the details are unclear. South China agricultural university, found beta coronavirus in the pangolin, it is need to further research whether it belong to novel coronavirus or not. South China seafood wholesale market is the main source of infection in Wuhan city of Hubei province. The early cases of NCP were mainly imported infections directly or indirectly from Wuhan [13] . According to the analysis of the current infection situation, Hubei province, is a NCP infections most populous province, followed by Guangzhou province and Zhejiang province, which is related to the economic development and intensive personnel exchanges; Henan province and Anhui provinces also had higher cases of NCP, which is related to neighboring of Hubei province. On January 26, 2020, the suspected cases of the NCP showed a rapid increase. According to the information that the general incubation period of the disease is 3-7 days and the diagnosis needs 2 days, the rapid increase of the suspected cases may be related to the banquet held by the community of Baibuting community in Wuhan city on January 18, 2020. On February 4, 2020, the confirmed cases of NCP has reached 38872. On February ,2020, the suspected cases of NCP has reached 5328. since then, suspected cases and confirmed cases were gradual decline, It may be related to the traffic control in Wuhan, as well as the first-level response to major public health emergencies and relevant control measures launched by several provinces on January 23, 2020, But during the Spring Festival, a time of traditional Chinese reunions, more than 10 million people in the city of Wuhan, the source of the .

The gold standard for diagnosing pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus infection is nucleic acid detection [5] . However, the novel coronavirus mainly infects the lower respiratory tract and is difficult to sample. At same time, the kit has high specificity, low sensitivity and long period, which makes difficult to timely diagnosis.\n\nAfter the recommendation of related experts, patients with imaging characteristics of NCP were considered as the standard of clinical diagnosis in Hubei province. After that, screening and diagnosis of novel coronaviruses have been accelerated. On [15] [16] , and the death cases were mainly middle-aged and elderly [1] . The basic reproduction number(R0) is an index that reflects the ability of the virus to transmit [17] .The basic reproduction number(R0) is defined as the number of second-generation cases that can be infected under ideal conditions when a case enters a susceptible population. On January 23, 2020, the WHO estimated that the basic reproduction number of the novel coronavirus was 1.4-2.5 [18] . The infectious power of the novel coronavirus was lower than that of SARS and MERS [19] [20] [21] [22] .\n\nAs for the \"turning point\" of the NCP, the spread index reflects the ability of the epidemic to spread, and the spread index of the novel coronavirus is not high.\n\n.

To some extent, the turning point in controlling the spread of NCP appears, but the onset of the novel coronavirus has a confidentiality and the novel coronavirus can also be infected during incubation period, at the same time, many people return back to work after the Spring Festival and the cumulative cases of NCP is still more, All these factors lead to that the NCP will still exist for a period of time. Extinction index reflects the extinction rate of the disease. Because there is no specific drug against the NCP and the course is long and the cumulative number of infections is large, the turning point of the disappearance of the disease in China mainland has not yet occurred, but the turning point of the disappearance of the NCP in China mainland except Hubei province has occurred. It is expected that serum antibodies to cure patients, traditional Chinese medicine, newly developed vaccines and drugs in clinical trials such as Remdesivir will work against the NCP [5, 23] .\n\nAll in all, from the number of newly suspected cases and newly confirmed cases of NCP, from the mortality and cure rate of NCP, from the spread index and extinction index of NCP, The control and treatment of NCP are moving in a better direction. We should continue to work in three aspects: controlling the source of infection, cutting off the route of transmission, and preventing susceptible people, and the novel coronavirus will soon be eliminated. At last, special thanks to all individuals and countries for their unselfish attention and assistance."}
