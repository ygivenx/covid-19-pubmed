{"title": "Coronavirus Glycoprotein El, a New Type of Viral Glycoprotein", "body": "Coronaviruses are a group of positive stranded, RNA-containing viruses, which cause respiratory. gastroenteric and central nervous disorders in humans and animals (McIntosh. 1974; Tyrrell et aE., 1978; Robb & Bond, 1979; Nagashima et ~1.. 1978 Nagashima et ~1.. ,1979 . Gerdes et al. (1981) have reported serological cross-reactivity between viruses isolated from multiple sclerosis patients and mouse hepatitis virus A59. a prototype coronavirus that has been characterized in some detail at the molecular level. It contains three structural proteins: a nucleocapsid protein N (JZ, 50.000). which is phosphorylated (Stohlman & Lai. 1979) , and the two envelope glycoproteins El and E2. Glycoprotein El is probably a transmembranal matrix protein with the carbohydrate moieties residing on the outside of the virus particle (Sturman, 1977) . E2 appears in the mature virion in two forms (M, 180,000 and ~~1,90,000), both of which constitute the club-shaped peplomers that protrude from the viral membrane and surround the particle like a corona. By treatment of purified virus with trypsin in vitro the M, 180,000 species of E2 can be converted int'o the M, 90,ooO cleavage products (Sturman & Holmes, 1977) .\n\nThe glycosylation of viral glycoproteins has been studied in detail for several enveloped viruses, including alpha-, rhabdo-and myxoviruses (for a review, see Klenk & Rott, 1980) . All these viruses share a common pathway of glycosylation: in a co-translat,ional event. the nascent polypeptide chain extending into t'he lumen of the rough endoplasmic ret,iculum is glycosylated by transfer en bloc of an act'ivated oligosaccharide from a dolichol-linked intermediate Dal-P-P-(GlcNAc)2Man,Glc3 (Struck & Lennarz, 1980) . This initial step requires a tripeptide sequence (H,K-Asn-X-Ser(Thr)-COOH) in the peptide chain, and the resulting carbohydrate protein linkage is of the N-glycosidic type between Nacetylglucosamine and asparagine. On t,he way to the plasma membrane, the core oligosaccharides are trimmed and new sugars, including galactose. 9acetylglucosamine.\n\nfucose and neuraminic acid. are added in the Golgi apparatus. From t,his organelle, viral glycoproteins are transported to the plasma membrane. where they are sequestered into budding virus particles.\n\nWe report here that glycoprotein El of roronaviruses does not follow this generally accepted glycosylation pathway.\n\nWe show that glycosylation of El is a post-translational event, and cannot be inhibited by tunicamycin and other glycosylation inhibitors that interfere with the formation of M-glycosidic linkages. The constituent analysis of the carbohydrate side-chains of El, as well as their sensitivity to mild alkaline treatment, suggest an O-glycosidic type of linkage between oligo-saccharides and polypeptide that has not been described before for viral structural proteins.\n\n(a) l'iruses wnd cells Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) A59 and its host cell line, the 17 clone 1 line of spontaneously transformed BalbC3T3 cells, were obtained from Dr L. S. Sturman, Albany, N.Y. The bovine coronavirus LQ was grown in primary bovine fetal t)hyroid cells as described by Storz et al. (1981~) . Virus was purified according to Sturman et al. (1980) . Virus titers were determined by plaque assays with 09% (w/v) agar in the overlay medium.\n\n(b) Labeling of viral polypeptides To obtain radioactive virus particles, [6-3H]glucosamine (25 Ci/mmol ; Amersham-Buchler, Braunschweig, F.R.G.), [ l-3H]galactose (40 Ci/mmol), [l-3H]fucose (46 Ci/mmol) or [2-3H]mannose (16 Ci/mmol) was added to the growth medium at a final concentration of 2 pCi/ml after the 1 h adsorption period of the virus. i4C-labeled protein hydrolysate (55 mCi/matom) was used at @5 &i/ml. (9, 10(n))-[3H]palmitic acid was used at 50&i/ml (Schmidt & Schlesinger, 1980) .\n\nTo analyze intracellular synthesis of viral polypeptides, monolayers of 17Cll cells on 5 cm Petri dishes were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 50 plaque-forming units/cell. At 16 h post infection, the medium was replaced by medium without leucine. After 2 h leucine starvation, the cells were pulse-labeled for 15 min by the addition of 300 &i ['H]leucine/ml, and were either lysed directly for immunoprecipitation or were chased in medium containing unlabeled leucine for the times indicated. In experiments where tunicamycin was used, the antibiotic (1 pg/ml; Eli Lilly, Indianapolis) was added at the beginning of the starvation period and was present throughout the rest of the experiment. Purified virus (5 x 109 p.f.u.t) emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant was injected intradermally into a New Zealand white rabbit. Five weeks later, the rabbit was boosted by subcutaneous injection of a virus suspension (10' p.f.u.) in saline. One week later, the rabbit was bled and the virus neutralization titer of the serum determined by plaque inhibition tests. The serum titer (500/, reduction of plaques) was 1 : 7000. For immunoprecipitation, the serum was purified from host cell-specific antibodies by passage over a Sepharose 4B-affinit)y column, to which cell extract from non-infected 17CLl rells was c.ovalently coupled.\n\n(d) Immunoprecipitation Labeled cells were lysed at 0\u00b0C in RIPA buffer (50 mlcr-Tris. HCl (pH 7.2), 10 rnM-EDTA. lo, (v/v) Triton X-100, l\"& (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, Old/, (w/v) SDS, and 59; (v/v) Trasylol, Bayer AG, Germany) and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 4 min : 100 ~1 of the supernatant were incubated for 60 min on ice with 10 ~1 of rabbit antiserum. The immune complexes were adsorbed to a suspension of protein A-bearing Staphyloccus aureus (Kessler, 1975) in RIPA buffer containing 10 y/, (v/v) fetal calf serum, and the mixture was \\vashed 4 times with wash buffer (10 mM-sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 10 mw-EDTA. 1 M-IVaCl. l(+b (v/v) Triton X-100, 50/o (v/v) Trasylol). The final pellet was resuspended in sample buffer and subject)ed to electrophoresis as described below.\n\n(e) Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isolatiorl of viral glycopeptides Xnalyt~ical5~, to 15% (w/v) polyacrylamide gradient slab gels containing @lo/, (w/v) SDS and 4 M-urea were used (Laemmli. 1970) . Samples were heated to 100\u00b0C for 2 min in 80 mM-Tris. HCl (pH 6%), @I% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS and 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. The resolved radiolabeled protein bands were localized by fluorography (Laskey & Mills, 1975) . using Kodak XAR-5 film. For preparative isolation of viral glycoproteins, cylindrical lo%<, polpacrylamide gels (7 mm x 100 mm) were used. They were sliced and t,he radioactivity of sister gels was determined by liquid scintillation counting (Schwarz & Klenk, 1974) . Viral glycoprot'eins were recovered by freezing and thawing, elution wit,h @lo, (w/v) SDS in water, filtration through 045 pm Millipore filter units and repeated precipitation in 900,, (v/v) aqueous acetone at 0\u00b0C. Preparations were then dialyzed against distilled water and lyophilized. Radiolabeled glycopeptides were obtained by digestion with 19, (w/v) Pronasr at .iO\"C in 1 M-Tris. HCl (pH !+O), 10m4 M-CaCl, for 48 h with a second addition of Pronase after 24 h. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was extracted with chloroform/methanol (2 : 1, v/v). The upper phase containing essentially all the radiolabel was lyophilized, and desalted on a Biogel P2 column (1 cm x 35 cm). Further fractionation of El glycopeptides was obtained by affinity chromatography on a column (lcm x 10 cm) of wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia). Desalted glgropeptldes were applied in 5 m&l-sodium acetate buffer (pH 52) to the column eyuilibrat'ed with the same buffer. The column was washed with this buffer, and adsorbed material was eluted with buffer containing @I M-S-acetylglucosamine.\n\nBoth the unbound and the bound fraction were desalted and freed from ,V-acetylglucosamine bJ chromatography on Biogel P2 as described above, using distilled water as an eluent. Binding studies of E2 glycopeptides to concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) were performed as desc~ribrd b,v Krusius 8: Finne (1977) .\n\n(f) Digestion with glycxxidases Glycopeptides were treated with 5 units of neuraminidase from Vibrio cholerup (Behringwerke) in 92 ml of 10 mM-Tris-acetate (pH 68). 2 mmC&l, at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. The incubation mixture was applied to a Biogel P6 column (1 cm x 150 cm) and eluted with 61 M-pyridine acetate (pH 5.2). Endo-/3-galactosidase from Escherichia freundii was a kind gift from Dr M. N. Fukuda (Seattle). El glycopeptides were incubat'ed at, 37\u00b0C with 25 milliunits of enzyme in 0.2 ml of 61 M-sodium acetate (pH 5.8) for 18 h. Samples were analyzed on a column of Biogel P4 (minus 400 mesh; 1 cm x 150 cm).\n\nEndo-/?-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Streptomyces griseus) was purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo, Japan. E2 glycopeptides were incubated with 25 milliunits of the enzyme in 005 ml of 905 M-citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 55). Incubations were for 18 h at 37\u00b0C under a toluene atmosphere. The enzyme-treated glycopeptides were then analyzed on a Biogel P4 (minus 400 mesh) column as described above.\n\n(g) Alkali borohydride treatmenf For the analysis of amino acids, radiolabeled glycoproteins E 1 (& 23,000) and E2 (iw, 90,060) were subjected to p-elimination conditions according to Pigman & Downs (1977) , using porcine submaxillary gland protein as a control. Amino acid analyses were performed on a Biotronic LCBOOO amino acid analyzer as described by Spackman et al. (1958) . For the preparation of reduced oligosaccharides, t,he method of Carlson (1974) was applied with the following modifications : samples were kept at 45\u00b0C for 10 h in 0.1 iv-NaOH, containing 1 M-NaBH, and Olq6 (w/v) SDS. After cooling to 0\u00b0C the pH of the mixture was adjusted to 5.0 by the addition of 4 M-aqueous acetic acid, and samples were psssed over a Dowex 50 WX 2 (200 to 400 mesh : H + form ; SERVA) column (1 cm x 8 cm) and washed with l($, (v/v) acetic acid. The eluted material was lyophilized and boric acid was removed by repeated evaporation with methanol at 30\u00b0C.\n\nHigh-voltage paper electrophoresis of released oligosaccharides was conducted on Whatman no. 3MM paper in pyridine/acetic acid/water (10 : 4 : 86. by vol.), pH 53, at 25 V/cm for 6 h. The paper was then cut into 95 cm strips and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation count,ing. Molecular weights of the released oligosaccharides were determined on a calibrated Biogel P4 (minus 460 mesh, batch no. 163034) column (1 cm x 150 cm) in 0.1 M-pyridine acetate (pH 5.3). Fractions of 043 ml were taken and assayed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting.\n\n(h) Carbohydratr mcxstituent analysis All reagents were of ultrapure grade or freshly distilled. Desalted glycopeptides containing 5 to 10 pg of total sugar were hydrolyzed in 0.25 M-H,SO, in 900/, (v/v) aqueous acetic acid at 80\u00b0C for 8 h, reduced and peracetylated as described by Stellner & Hakomori (1974) . Peracetylated alditol acetates were analyzed on a Finnigan model 4021 combined gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer, using a 25 m fused silica capillary column with Dexsil 410 as the wall coating phase. Sugar ratios were calculated on the basis of the total reconstructed ion chromatograms, applying response factors t,hat were determined with corresponding commercial standards.\n\nPaper chromatography of re-5-acetylated hydrolysates was carried out on Whatman 3MM paper sheets in t,he descending manner using ethyl acetate/pyridine/water (4 : 1 : 1, by vol.) as the solvent.\n\n(a) Analysis of radiolabeled mouse hepatitis virus proteins MHV A59 was grown in the presence of 3H-labeled sugars or 14C-labeled protein hydrolysate, and purified virus preparations were analyzed by SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1 FIN:. I. Incorporat,ion of radioact~iw amino acids (14C) and sugars (3H) into coronavirus A59 polypeptides. Coronavirus A59 was grown in the 17 clone 1 line of spontaneously transformed RalbC3T3 cells in the presence of radioactive markers as indicated. Virus was harvested 30 h post infection. purified and analyzed on cylindrical SDS-containing lOo,b (w/v) polyacrylamide gels. Gels were sliced and radioactivity of the resolved polypeptides (indicated in (a)) determined by liquid scint,illation counting.\n\n( Fig. l(a) ). The periph era1 spike glycoprotein E2 (M, 180,000) and its proteolytic J& 90,000 cleavage products were poorly labeled. This is probably due to partial loss of spike peplomers during virus purification, which is a common observation with coronaviruses. The analqrsis of MHV labeled with the radioactive sugars 16-3H Iglucosamine. [ l-3H]galactose. [l-3H]fucose and 12-3H lmannose showed t'hat each of these sugars is present in E2. This was not' unexpected, since this carbohydrate pattern is found in many other viral glycoproteins. El, however, was not labeled with either fucose or mannose (Fig. l(d) and (e)). The absence of mannose is significant, since mannose is an essential constituent of the carbohydrat,e core structures of N-glycosidically linked side-chains. The radioactive band in Figure 1 (b) and (c) migrating faster than glycoprotein El is probably glycolipid. This is suggested by the observations that this material is not labeled by amino acids, mannose or fucose, and that it is removed from the gel after fixation with organic solvents, such as isobutanol (Fig. 2) .\n\nIn order t)o investigate whether the presence of Fl with its abnormal labeling characteristics is unique for the murine coronavirus A59 or a general coronavirusspecific phenomenon. we have also analyzed the glycosylat,ion pattern of the enteropathogenic bovine coronavirus L9 grown in primary bovine fetal thyroid cells (Storz et al.. 1981a,6; Fig. 2) . A low molecular weight glycoprotein comigrating with the murine El in SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was present in the bovine virus preparations. This polypeptide readily aggregated to material of high molecular weight when boiled in the presence of reducing agents (data not shown), as does glycoprotein El of the murine virus (Sturman, 1977) . Metabolic labeling indicat'ed that El of the bovine virus could again be labeled only with galact'ose and glucosamine but not with fucose or mannose.\n\n(b) Labeling with [\"H]palmitic acid In order to investigate whether glycoprotein El purified by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was possibly contaminated with tightly bound glycolipids, we analyzed A59 virus grown in the presence of [3H]palmitic acid. Figure 3 shows that El was not labeled under these conditions. Thus, glycolipid contamination could be excluded. However, significant amounts of label were incorporated into glycoprotein E2 and its proteolytic cleavage products. Therefore. it appears that E2 contains covalently bound fatty acids.\n\nThe different labeling characteristics of A59 glycoproteins El and E2 were confirmed by sugar constituent analyses of El and E2 glycopeptides, which were obtained from the purified polypeptides by digestion with Pronase and gel filtration on Biogel P6. El glycopeptides were further fractionated by chromatography on wheat germ agglutinin bound to Sepharose 4B into an unbound fraction (63% of the applied material) and a bound fraction (37oj,), which was eluted with @l M-Nacetylglucosamine. The major sugar constituents of the bound and the unbound fraction were galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine and neuraminic acid ( Fig. 4 and Table 1 ). The latter sugar was identified by highvoltage paper electrophoresis of neuraminidase-treated El glycopeptides (Fig. 5 ). 4B (about 5 pg of total sugar) were hydrolyzed, reduced, peracetylated and analyzed on a 25 m fused silica capillary column by combined gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. A temperature program of 2 deg.C/min from 150 to 230\u00b0C was applied after a 5 min delay of the starting temperature. Peaks were identified according to their retention time (abscissa) and their fragmentation pattern. The peak with scan number 986 did not show sugar characteristic fragmentation. glycopeptides were applied to a Biogel P6 column (1 cm x 150 cm) and eluted with water containing 062% (w/v) NaNs (shaded profile). Fractions of 1 ml were taken and radioactivity of portions was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The glycopeptides eluted at molecular weights between 2200 and 1800. After enzymatic removal of neuraminic acid residues, a reduction in molecular weight to about 1506 was observed for the main fraction (open profile). About 30% of the label eluted in the position of free N-acetylneuraminic acid (fraction 142 to 152). This material was lyophilized and comigrated with N-acetylneuraminic acid standard in high-voltage paper electrophoresis.\n\nBoth fractions contained negligible amounts of mannose and no fucose. The presence of minute amounts of glucose is considered a contamination, since no radioactive glucose was detected in hydrolysates of [ 3H]galactose-labeled glycopeptides by paper chromatography. Due to metabolic conversion, radioactive N-acetylgalactosamine was detected with this method in hydrolysates of El glycopeptides that had been labeled with either ]l-3H]galactose or [6-'HJglucosamine (data not shown). Both the wheat germ agglutinin-bound and unbound fraction were resistant to treatment with endo-/?-galactosidase from Escherichia freundii.\n\nThis enzyme hydrolyzes Gal+-1 -+ 4-GlcNAc linkages in polylactosaminyl structures, but does not allow branching of the galactose residue (Fukuda, 1981) .\n\nThe sugar composition of E2 glycopeptides showed the typical composition of Nglycosidically linked carbohydrate side-chains commonly found in viral glycoproteins. Treatment of [ 3H]glucosamine-labeled glycopeptides with endo+-Nacetylglucosaminidase H from Streptomyees griseus followed by analysis on a Biogel P4 (minus 400 mesh) column revealed that 15% of the material was sensitive to this enzyme, indicating the presence of mannose-rich side-chains in E2. This was further evidenced by binding studies of E2 glycopeptides to a column of concanavalin A covalently linked to Sepharose 4B: 5Soo of glucosamine-labeled glycopeptides did not bind and were eluted with buffer; 32% could be eluted with 20 mM-a-methylmannoside; and 14% showed a high affinity to the lectin and were eluted with 200 mM-cu-methylmannoside (data not, shown).\n\nA standard procedure to distinguish N-glycosidic carbohydrate-protein linkages from O-glycosidic linkages is the susceptibility of the latter to mild alkaline degradation (Zinn et al., 1977) . We have applied this method for sugar-labeled glycoproteins El and E2 and analyzed released oligosaccharides after passage over Dowex 50 W'X 2 (H + form) by high-voltage paper electrophoresis and gel filtrat,ion. About' 9596 of the carbohydrate label of El was recovered in the runthrough of the ion-exchange column, whereas essentially all the label of E2 was retained. In highvoltage paper electrophoresis at pH 5.3, 800/,, of the El-derived oligosaccharides were charged and migrated towards the anode. When El labeled with i4C-labeled amino acids was used in a similar p-elimination reaction and subjected t*o electrophoresis without prior ion-exchange treatment, all the label remained at the origin. This indicabes that, under the alkaline conditions of the eliminat,ion reaction. no significant breakdown of the polypeptide backbone of El occurs. The oligosaccharides released from [3H]galactose-labeled El were resolved by gel filt)ration on a calibrated Biogel P4 column into four different peaks, eluting at fractions 168. 181, 208 and 215 (Fig. 6 ). Using oligosaccharides of the mannose-rich type as standards, their molecular weights were determined as 1550, 1100, 570 and 480. respectively. The structural analysis of these fractions is under investigation.\n\nFor mucine-type glycoproteins, which contain exclusivelg O-glycosidic carbohydrate side-chains linked to serine and t,hreonine residues, it has been shown t,hat, these amino acids are converted into alanine and n-aminobutyric acid. rrspect,ively, when the p-elimination was followed by palladium-catalyzed hJ.drogenation (Pigman & Downs, 1977) . Using porcine submaxillary mucine, we were able to confirm such a conversion. However, when we carried out amino acid analyses of El that had been subjected to p-elimination under reducing conditions, we were unable to detect a decrease in the serine and threonine content of the Fraction number Fro. 6. Molecular weights of the oligosaccharides obtained by p-elimination from El of coronavirus A%. Glycoprotein El was subjected to /I-elimination and released oligosaccharides were analyzed on a Biogel P4 (minus 406 mesh) column (1 cm x 150 cm). Fractions of 043 ml were taken and assayed for radioactivity.\n\nThe following compounds were used for the calibration of the column as indicated by arrows: Vc, (exclusion volume) bovine serum albumin; (1) glycoprotein, or a concomitant increase in the alanine and a-aminobutyric acid content. The failure to identify serine and threonine as attachment sites for the oligosaccharides could be explained by the fact that only a small proportion of these residues are glycosylated. It is also conceivable that the reduced solubility of the carbohydrate-free El (K. Holmes, personal communication) does not allow proper hydrogenation of the unsaturated amino acids formed during p-elimination. The intracellular synthesis of viral polypeptides is shown in Figure 7 . Infected 17Cll cells were pulse-chase labeled 18 hours post infection. Cytoplasmic lysates were immunoprecipitated with a serum raised against purified virus. Three major virus-specific proteins were precipitated, forming single bands at M, 180,000 and M, 50,000, and a double band at AZ, 20,000 and M, 23,000. They co-migrated (data not shown) with the virion proteins E2 (M, 180,000) . N (A& 50,000), and El (M, 23,000). In addition, four minor species were precipitated (at M, values of 120,000, 90,000, 65,000 and 38,000). The M,90,000 species, which appeared with leucine labeling only after 80 minutes of chase, co-migrated with the virion E2 (,V, 90.000). indicating that the prot)eolytic cleavage of the Lllr 180.000 species is a post~translational event. Two int~racellular forms of t,he El protein have also been report'ed with the murine coronavirus ,JHM. and it has been suggested (Siddell et nl.. 1981 ) that the larger species (M, 25,000) is derived by glpcosylation from the smaller (,!I, 23.000). The romept.\n\nthat the same type of precursor-product relationship exists between the M, 23,000 and the X, 20,000 species of El of coronavirus A59. is suggested 1)) our observation that the smaller form is already labeled after a short pulse. whereas the larger appears only after a longer chase. As shown before. the carbohydrate moiety of glycoprotein El could be labeled only wit'h radioactive galactose and glucosamine.\n\nRoth of these sugars were incorporated into the ill, 23.000 species of the El polvpeptide and not the Nr 20,000 species, in pulse-chase labeling esperiments (Fig. 7. track R) . This suggests that glyoxylation of El. likt> l)rotrolytic* cleavage of E2, is a post-translat,ional event.\n\n(f) $ffmts of glyco.Tylation inhibitors on the synthesis of El clnd &El;?\n\nTunicamycin inhibits the formation of dolichol-linked S-a~et,~lglucosar~~ir~~I pyrophosphat,e, which serves as an essential int)ermediat,e in the S-glycosvlation of glvcoproteins (for a review, see Schwarz & Datema. 1980) . The effects of this inhibitor on the synthesis of viral glycoproteins in infected cells are also shown in Figure 7 . At a t,unicamycin concentration of 1 pg/ml. prot,ein synthesis was only slightly redmed. Furthermore, glycosylation of El followed essentially the same kinetics as in the absence of t)he inhibitor.\n\nE2. however, showed a drastic decrease in its apparent, molecular weight. yielding a M, 150.000 species. designated E2,. In a similar experiment.\n\nthis species could not be labeled wit,h galactose (dat,a not shown). This indicates that the iWr 150,000 species is the non-glycosq-lated form of' Ed. An inhibitory effect of tunicamycin on t,he synthesis of E2 has also been repotted by Holmes et nl. (1981) . However. these authors were unable to demonstrate the synthesis of the non-glycosylated E2 analog. The presence of tunicamycin and of other inhibitors. such as P-droxy arabinohexose (2-deoxy-glucose) and 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-glucose. known to int)erferr with the formation of X-glycosidic linkages, did not inhibit virus part~icle formation. This is demonstrated in Figure 8 , which shows t'he glycoprot'eins of purified virus part'icles formed in the presence of these inhibitors.\n\nThe compounds interfered with the glycosylation of E2. but had no significant, effect on El. Particles formed in the presence of tunicamycin and 2-deoxy-glucose lacked detectable amounts of E2.2-Deoxy-2-fluoro-glucose caused hetjerogeneous E2. This is probably due to glycosylation vin an alternative pathway, in which shorter oligosaccharides are transferred from the lipid-linked intermediate to the nascent polypept,ide.\n\nwhich are not processed in the way outlined in the Int,roduction (Datema et ~1.. 1980) .\n\nThe specific infectivity of virus particles synthesized in the presence of these inhibitors was determined by plaque assays. Tunicamycin, as well as 2deoxy. glucose. reduced the infectivity by a factor of more than 104. This indicates t,hat gtycosylation of E2 is an essential requirement, for the infectivity of coronavirus particles. (Calbiochem), 2deoxy-arabinohexose (Serva), or tunicamycin (Eli Lilly) were present at concentrations of 8 mg/ml, 20 mg/ml and 1 pg/ml, respectively. The infectivity of A59 particles released into the culture fluid was determined by plaque assays. The titers were 6 x lo6 p.f.u./ml (for the control virus), 1.8 x lo6 p.f.u./ml (fluoro-glucose), 3 x 10' p.f.u./ml (deoxyglucose). and 2 x IO* p.f.u./ml (tunicamycin).\n\nPurified virus preparations were analyzed on cylindrical SDS/lo% (w/v) polgacrylamide gels, which were sliced and counted as described in Materials and Methods.\n\nOur data demonstrate that the two glycoprotein species of the coronavirus envelope differ in several important structural and biosynthetic properties. These include the structure of the carbohydrate side-chains, the covalent binding of fatty acids, the processing steps at the co-translational and post-translational level, and the sensitivity to glycosylation inhibitors. Because of these differences, it, is now calear that El and E2 belong to two distinct glycoprotein classes. Glycoprotein E2 has carbohydrate side-chains with N-glycosidic linkages, as is the case with glycoproteins of rhabdoviruses, ortho-and paramyxoviruses. alphaviruses, and oncornaviruses. This conclusion is based on the following observations. (1) We show by metabolic labeling and by chemical analysis that E2 contains glucosamine. mannose, galactose, fucose and neuraminic acid. Basically. the same carbohydrate composition has been found with the glycoproteins of all t'he other viruses. Most of the E2 side-chains are of the complex type. About 15% of the glycopeptides derived from E2 are sensitive to treatment with endoglycosidase H and show strong binding to concanavalin A, indicating t,hat these side-chains belong to t,he mannose-rich type.\n\n(2) The side-chains of E2 cannot be removed 1)~ ~~elimination.\n\n(3) Glycosylation of E2 is inhibited by tunicamycin and 2deoxyglucose. and it is altered by 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-glucose.\n\nThese compounds interfere specifically with the biosynthesis of oligosaccharides linked by Sglycosidic linkages to the polypeptide. In the presence of tunicamycin, E2 is svnthesized in its non-glycosylated form. This polypeptide appears to be quite stable in the infected cell, but the available evidence indicates that it is not, incorporated into virus particles which, according to the data presented here and for similar studies by Sturman (1981) , are still being formed under these conditjions. (4) The observation that the unglycosylated E2 polypeptide can be detected only in the presence of inhibitors of glycosylation indicates that glycosylation of this glycoprotein is initiated at the co-translational level. This is. again. typical for N-glycosidic carbohydrate protein linkages.\n\nThere are yet other aspecus in which E2 resembles viral glycoproteins with wellestablished N-glycosidic linkages. Some of these, such as the G protein of vesicular stomatit'is virus. glycoprotein El and E2 of alphaviruses. the hemagglutinin of influenza virus and the F protein of paramyxoviruses are acylated (Schmidt, 1982) . and we have found now that coronavirus protein E2 contains also fatty acid in cdovalent linkage. Post-translational proteolytic cleavage is another modificat,ion that is observed both with E2 of coronaviruses and with a whole series of other viral glycoproteins : e.g. with the influenza virus hemagglutinin, the F and HN glp(*oproteins of paramyxoviruses, the precursor of the E2 and E3 glycoproteins of a,lphaviruses. and the envelope glycoproteins of type C retroviruses (for a review. see Klenk CC Bott, 1980 in coronavirus JHM, and these authors also proposed a glycosylation event to explain the change in the apparent, molecular weight.\n\nIn t,he presence of tunicamycin, where glycosylation of E2 is completely inhibited, t'he non-glycosylated El (M, 20,000) ' p IS recessed into the glycosylated species (M, 23,000) with the same kinetics as in the absence of the antibiotic.\n\n2-Deoxyglucose and 2-deoxy-2-Auoro-glucose. which also interfere with Nglycosylation have no effect' on the glycosylation of El. In the light, of investigations reported by Gahmberg et al. (1980) , these observat,ions further support the concept of O-glycosidic linkages in El. When these authors studied the effects of tunicamycin on the glycosylat'ion of glycophorin, which contains both N and O-glycosidic side-chains, they found that) the drug int)erfered only with the attachment of the N-glycosidic side-chain and had no effect on the O-glycosidic linkages.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if the structural differences between El and E2 can be correlat'ed to differences in the function of the two glycoproteins. There is evidence that Ed is necessary for the cell-fusing capacity of the virus (Holmes ef nl.. 1981) and that proteolytic cleavage is essential for this activity (Storz et al., 1981) . It is therefore, tempting to speculate that E2 initiates infection as do the glycoproteins of ortho-and paramyxoviruses. Glycoprotein E 1, on the other hand, has been suggested to play an important role in envelope formation and in the interaction between the envelope and the nucleocapsid (Sturman et al., 1980) . In this respect, it is interesting to note that, in contrast to most other enveloped viruses, coronaviruses mature by budding from the endoplasmic reticulum (McIntosh, 1974) . Whether the unusual carbohydrate pattern of El can be correlated to the unusual budding site remains to be seen. Despite the fact that a large variety of secretory and membrane proteins of great biological interest are glycoproteins with O-glycosidic linkages (for a review. see Montreuil, 1980) . int,racellular transport and processing of these glycoproteins is still only poorly understood.\n\nWe know of only two other reports where evidence for the existence of O-glycosidic linkages in viral glycoproteins has been obtained. These glycoproteins are the hemagglutinin of vaccinia virus, which is found in the infected cell but not) in virus particles (Shida & Dales, lSSl) , and herpes simplex virus glycoproteins (Olofsson et al.. 1981 of Elfriede Otto and Mechthild Rosing is gratefully acknowledged.
