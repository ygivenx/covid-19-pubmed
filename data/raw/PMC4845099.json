{"title": "Inhibitor Recognition Specificity of MERS-CoV Papain-like\nProtease May Differ from That of SARS-CoV", "body": "We and others have previously identified and developed\na series of\nnoncovalent SARS-PLpro inhibitors using high-throughput screening\n(HTS) and structure-based drug design that can be classified into\ntwo distinct scaffolds.25\u221228 Four inhibitor structures from these two scaffolds\nare shown in Figure 2A, with I-1 and I-2 representing scaffold 1 and I-3 and I-4 representing scaffold 2. Inhibitors I-2 and I-3 exhibited excellent inhibitory activities with\nIC50 values of 0.34 \u03bcM and 0.6 \u03bcM against SARS-PLpro,\nwith SARS antiviral activities of 2 \u03bcM and 15 \u03bcM, respectively.25,28 The four SARS-PLpro lead inhibitors (I-1\u2013I-4) were tested against MERS-PLpro to determine whether these\ntwo PLpro enzymes behave similarly or not. Surprisingly, none of them\nshowed any inhibitory activity against MERS-PLpro. This result led\nus to further analyze what determined the interaction between SARS-PLpro\nand its inhibitors.\n\nThere are seven SARS-PLpro crystal structures available to\ndate,\nfour of which are complexes with an inhibitor and two are substrate-bound.21,25\u221228 In the case of MERS-PLpro, one apo and two substrate-bound complexes\nhave been recently published.29,30 We also determined\nthe X-ray crystal structure of unbound MERS-PLpro (PDB code: 4RNA) at 1.8 \u00c5 (Supporting Information Table S1) in addition\nto our previously released apo structure at lower resolution (PDB\ncode: 4PT5).\nBoth SARS-PLpro and MERS-PLpro contain two blocking loops named BL1\nand BL2 that could be structurally important. The two corresponding\nloops of human ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (USP14) have been proven\nto be crucial in blocking accessibility to the active site.31 Indeed, two SARS-PLpro complex crystal structures,\nwith lead inhibitors from each scaffold (I-2 or I-3) revealed that inhibitors bind not to the catalytic site\nof the PLpro enzyme but to the BL2 loop, blocking the entrance of\nthe active site. This appears to prevent substrate access to the catalytic\nsite, inhibiting PLpro enzyme activity. The amide group of inhibitor I-2 forms two hydrogen bonds with D165 and Q270 (Figure 2B). The amide group of inhibitor I-3 also forms a hydrogen bond with Q270 in the BL2 loop (Figure 2C). The aromatic ring of Y269 forms a hydrophobic\ninteraction with the naphthyl ring of both I-2 and I-3. Therefore, residues Q270 and Y269 form common key interactions\nin both scaffold 1 and 2 lead inhibitors of SARS-CoV PLpro. However,\nneither Q270 nor Y269 residues exist in MERS-PLpro (Figure 2D). In MERS-PLpro, A275 exists in place of Q270\nof SARS-PLpro, eliminating potential hydrogen bonding with inhibitors.\nAdditionally, the second key interaction is also impossible because\nT274 of the MERS-PLpro does not have the aromatic ring of Y269. Apparently\ndue to the lack of these two key residues, none of the SARS-PLpro\nlead inhibitors had any inhibitory efficacy against MERS-PLpro.\n\nIn order to further analyze the interaction between SARS-PLpro\nand its inhibitors, we aligned all four available SARS-PLpro\u2013inhibitor\ncomplexes, one SARS-PLpro in complex with a ubiquitin aldehyde substrate,\none MERS-PLpro complex with a ubiquitin substrate, and the apo structures\nof both SARS-PLpro and MERS-PLpro (Figure 3).21,25\u221228,30 In addition, all residues involved in inhibitor binding by SARS-PLpro\nand their corresponding residues in MERS-PLpro are compared to three\nbat coronaviruses because of the similarities of MERS-CoV with bat\ncoronaviruses BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5. The residues compared include\nthe active site, catalytic triad, and BL2 loop residues (Figure 3E). All eight structures aligned well with each\nother, except for several distinct locations, including the zinc-binding\nmotif and BL2 regions. The zinc atoms were shifted similar distances\nand locations in all five SARS-PLpro complex structures as compared\nto the apo structure, as noted with a red arrow pointed to the right\nin the bottom insert in Figure 3A. The equivalent\nzinc atom in MERS-PLpro was located in a different position and was\nshifted in a different direction from those in SARS-PLpro (dark brown\narrow in Figure 3A). Residues involved in the\nSARS-PLpro inhibitor binding are shown in Figure 3B, along with inhibitor I-3, in order to illustrate\nthe orientation of the inhibitor, inhibitor-interacting SARS-PLpro\nresidues, and the flexible BL2 loop. Figure 3C and D show the binding locations of inhibitors and ubiquitin substrates\nand the flexible BL2 loop in exactly the same orientation. The SARS-PLpro\nflexible BL2 loop blocks the entrance of the tunnel to the active\nsite when it is unbound and becomes well-ordered upon binding of either\nan inhibitor or a substrate (Figure 3C and\nD) through conformational changes.21,26\u221228,32,33 For MERS-PLpro, the flexible BL2 loop is positioned much further\nfrom its active site than that of SARS-PLpro when it is unbound. Upon\nsubstrate binding to MERS-PLpro, its BL2 loop moves to an orientation\nsimilar to that of the substrate bound SARS-PLpro loop, as noted with\nred and dark brown arrows in Figure 3D.30 Both BL1 and BL2 loops of USP14 appear to play\na regulatory role in its deubiquitinating activity,31 while mainly BL2 seems to serve this role in SARS-PLpro.\nThe question of whether the BL2 loop of MERS-PLpro plays a regulatory\nrole in its deubiquitinating activity remains to be answered.\n\nPrescreen assay optimization\nprior to a large scale HTS is crucial\nto achieving a high quality outcome. Essential factors for consideration\ninclude the enzyme and substrate concentrations, additives (detergent\nand reducing agent), the DMSO tolerance, and enzyme stability. The\nmost important factor is the substrate concentration, and it is recommended\nto use a substrate concentration near or slightly lower than the Michaelis\nconstant (KM) value in order to select\nfor both competitive and noncompetitive inhibitors.34 The KM was determined with\nthe ubiquitin-derived peptide substrate, RLRGG-AMC, for both SARS-PLpro\nand MERS-PLpro enzymes side by side for comparison. The substrate KM value of MERS-PLpro was \u223c2-fold larger\nat 142 \u03bcM and 75.9 \u03bcM for MERS-PLpro and SARS-CoV, respectively\n(Supporting Information Table S2). Therefore,\na higher substrate concentration was used for MERS-PLpro than for\nthe SARS-PLpro HTS screen. The kcat (turnover\nnumber) value of SARS-CoV was \u223c25-fold larger than that of\nMERS-PLpro, which made the catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of SARS-PLpro for\nthis substrate \u223c45-fold higher than that of MERS-PLpro. Accordingly,\na 20-fold higher MERS-PLpro enzyme concentration was necessary to\nyield an enzyme activity signal similar to that of SARS-PLpro. DMSO\ntolerance, reducing agent effect, two additives (BSA and Triton X-100)\neffect, and enzyme stability at RT were determined in addition to\noptimal substrate and enzyme concentrations for HTS.\n\nTo search for MERS-PLpro\ninhibitors, HTS was performed with a 25 000-compound\nLife Chemicals antimicrobial/antiviral focused library against both\nSARS-PLpro and MERS-PLpro. The overall screening and hit validation\nprocess are described in Figure 4A. The primary\nHTS screen against SARS-PLpro was performed in duplicate, generating\naverage Z\u2032-factors of 0.64 \u00b1 0.08. The MERS-PLpro primary\nscreen was done in a single pass with Z\u2032-factors of 0.65 \u00b1\n0.11. HTS hits with over 50% inhibition at 50 \u03bcM compound concentration\nwere cherry picked and reanalyzed by a continuous kinetic assay to\nfilter out false positives. The enzyme omission assay with exactly\nthe same assay conditions, but without the PLpro enzyme, was performed\nto remove fluorescence signal interfering compounds. Confirmed hits\nwere repurchased, and their inhibitory activities (IC50 values) were determined from full inhibition curves.\n\nOf \u223c25 000 compounds,\nfour (compounds 1\u20134 in Figure 4B) and three\n(compounds 4\u20136 in Figure 4B) exhibited inhibitory activity with IC50 values below 50 \u03bcM for SARS-PLpro and MERS-PLpro, respectively.\nSurface plasmon resonance (SPR) was used as a secondary orthogonal\nbinding assay to eliminate false positives from the primary hits since\nour primary screen was done by a fluorescence-based enzymatic assay.\nBinding affinity of each hit compound can be determined by measuring\nthe dissociation equilibrium constant (KD) using SPR, and IC50 and KD values for the six hit compounds are compared in Figure 4B. Compound 2 from the four SARS-PLpro\nhits did not bind to the enzyme, indicating that it is a false positive,\nwhile the remaining three were confirmed to be binders with KD values below 50 \u03bcM. The binding affinities\nof these validated hits varied from 26.3 \u03bcM to 39.9 \u03bcM,\nand their corresponding IC50 values varied from 10.9\u201331.4\n\u03bcM. The IC50 and KD values\nof 3 are 31.4 \u03bcM and 39.9 \u03bcM, respectively,\nwhich are similar. The KD value of 4 (26.3 \u03bcM) is approximately 2.4-fold greater than its\nIC50 value (10.9 \u03bcM). Of the three MERS-PLpro hits,\nonly 4 showed specific binding to the enzyme, with 18.4\n\u03bcM binding affinity, while 5 and 6 were false positives. Compound 5 did not bind to MERS-PLpro\nat all, whereas compound 6 bound nonspecifically. These\nthree distinct binding patterns determined by SPR, specific, no binding,\nand nonspecific interactions, are shown in Supporting\nInformation Figure S3A\u2013C. Interestingly, compound 4 showed similar strength of inhibitory activities and binding\naffinity against both SARS-PLpro and MERS-PLpro enzymes.\n\nThere have been two types of\nnoncovalent small molecule inhibitor scaffolds against SARS-PLpro\npreviously discovered by our research group. Mechanism of inhibition\nstudies revealed that these compounds are mixed-type inhibitors with\n\u03b1 values greater than 1, indicating that they bind to an allosteric\nsite other than its catalytic site but behave as if they are competitive\ninhibitors.35 As noted above, these lead\ninhibitors bind to the flexible BL2 region and induce conformational\nchanges to block substrate access to the catalytic site of the enzyme.26,28 There have been no MERS-PLpro inhibitors published to date; we have\nidentified one compound (4) that inhibits both SARS-PLpro\nand MERS-PLpro. Our mode of inhibition studies with compound 4 were done with a series of increasing substrate concentrations\nand enzyme-compound complexes (Figure 5A and\nB). The kinetic data were fit to four different enzyme inhibition\nmodels (competitive, noncompetitive, uncompetitive, and mixed-type)\nusing the Sigmaplot Enzyme Kinetics Module. The best fit equation\nwas selected based on Akaike Information Criterion-corrected (AICc)\nvalues.36 The equation with the lowest\nAICc value corresponds to the best fit, and a minimum of a two AICc\nunit difference from the next lowest is required to be considered\nstatistically significant. Interestingly, compound 4 exhibited\nmixed-type inhibition for SARS-PLpro but competitive inhibition for\nMERS-PLpro for the same substrate. The second best fit equation of\ncompound 4 with SARS-PLpro was noncompetitive inhibition\nwith 7.1 AICc values lower than the best fit (mixed-type) inhibition,\nwhich was also 38.6 AICc values lower than competitive inhibition,\nclearly indicating that compound 4 is an allosteric inhibitor\nof SARS-PLpro. For MERS-PLpro, the AICc value of competitive inhibition\nwas 19.4 units lower than the next lowest, noncompetitive inhibition.\nBecause of the large AICc value differences from the next best fit\nequations for both SARS and MERS-PLpro, it is clear that the same\ncompound acts as an allosteric inhibitor for SARS-PLpro and acts as\na competitive inhibitor for MERS-PLpro. Therefore, this compound inhibits\nthe two PLpro enzymes via two different inhibitory mechanisms even\nthough the inhibitory activities are similar, with IC50 values of 10.9 \u03bcM (SARS-PLpro) and 6.2 \u03bcM (MERS-PLpro).\nThe Ki values of compound 4 against SARS-PLpro and MERS-PLpro are 11.5 \u03bcM and\n7.6 \u03bcM, respectively (Figure 5C).\n\nCompound 4 appears to interact with\nMERS-PLpro by\nbinding to the catalytic site since it is a competitive inhibitor\nwith respect to the substrate. However, we were uncertain where 4 might bind to SARS-PLpro since it is an allosteric inhibitor.\nOur first hypothesis was that it may bind to the BL2 loop where two\nother SARS-PLpro lead inhibitors (I-2 and I-3) bound. We thus evaluated inhibition by 4 in the presence\nof each of the four SARS-PLpro lead inhibitors (I-1\u2013I-4) in order to see if it has an additive effect (Figure 5D). If 4 binds to the same location\nas I-2 and I-3, their inhibitory activities\n(IC50 values) would not be improved by the addition of\ncompound 4. But their IC50 values should be\nenhanced if compound 4 binds elsewhere. Inhibitory activities\nof the four lead inhibitors alone varied from 0.23 \u03bcM to 2.26\n\u03bcM, and their IC50 values were enhanced up to almost\n7-fold (0.034\u20130.67 \u03bcM) in the presence of 4 at a concentration of 10 \u03bcM, slightly lower than its IC50 value. This led us to conclude that 4 binds\nto an allosteric site of the SARS-PLpro other than the BL2 loop. In\naddition to enzymatic mode of inhibition analysis, competition SPR\nstudies of compound 4 with SARS-PLpro and MERS-PLpro\nwere each performed in the presence and in the absence of the substrate.\nBinding affinity of compound 4 to SARS-PLpro was the\nsame regardless of substrate presence, whereas that of compound 4 to MERS-PLpro was 4.5-fold weaker in the presence of the\nsubstrate than 4 alone. These results indicate that the\nsubstrate is competing with 4 for the same binding site\nin MERS-PLpro (Figure 5E). Therefore, both\nthe enzymatic mechanism of inhibition and SPR studies support compound 4 being an allosteric inhibitor for SARS-PLpro, while 4 is a competitive inhibitor for MERS-PLpro. In order to further\nclarify this, cocrystallizations of both SARS-PLpro and MERS-PLpro\nwith compound 4 are currently in process.\n\nA concern of potential nonspecificity\nwas raised due to the fact that our newly identified dual inhibitor\nis a small fragment-like compound and also exhibited inhibitory activity\nagainst SARS-CoV 3CLpro with an IC50 value of 13.9 \u03bcM.37 X-ray crystallography and mode of inhibition\nstudies showed that 4 binds to the dimer interface of\nthe SARS-CoV 3CLpro, inhibiting its enzyme activity by breaking the\ndimer since SARS-CoV 3CLpro is a functional dimer (unpublished data).\nTherefore, compound 4 acts as an allosteric inhibitor\nagainst both SARS-CoV proteases (3CLpro and PLpro), whereas it acts\nas a competitive inhibitor against MERS-PLpro. We further investigated\nthe specificity of 4 and a lead inhibitor I-3 (control) against two human cysteine proteases also called human\nubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (hUCH-L1 and hUCH-L3) and two unrelated\nenzymes (Hepatitis C Virus NS3 serine protease and Bacillus\nanthracis dihydroorotase). The hUCH-L1 is one of the human\nhomologues most closely related to PLpro, which makes it an excellent\ncontrol to test the selectivity of a newly identified inhibitor. Structural\nalignment of these two human homologues revealed that their catalytic\ntriads are very similar (Figure 6A). Compound 4 was selective for SARS-PLpro and MERS-PLpro proteases over\nthe two human cysteine proteases and both unrelated enzymes (Figure 6B).\n\nThe\ncysteine/serine protease mechanism involves tetrahedral intermediate\nformation, following nucleophilic attack by the cysteine/serine side\nchain. Generally, there is an oxyanion close to the catalytic site,\nwhich interacts with a negatively charged tetrahedral intermediate\nto stabilize it. Ratia et al. demonstrated that the SARS-PLpro W107\nlocated below the catalytic cysteine plays this vital role in forming\na hydrogen bond (H-bond) with an intermediate as an H-bond donor in\nthe active site by showing that the SARS-PLpro W107A mutant completely\nlost catalytic activity.21 However, in\nthe MERS-PLpro active site, the equivalent position is occupied by\nL106, which is not capable of being an H-bond donor (Figure 7A). Lei et al. recently demonstrated that the L106W\nmutation resulted in catalytic activity enhancement of MERS-PLpro,29 indicating that the MERS-PLpro oxyanion hole\nmay not be complete in comparison to that of SARS-PLpro. Interestingly,\nthe leucine residue at this position is highly conserved in three\nbat coronaviruses (BtCoV-HKU4, BtCoV-HKU5, and BtCoV-133) that belong\nto the same lineage group C as MERS-CoV (Figure 7B). On the other hand, two human coronavirus (NL63 and 229E) PLpro\nenzymes have a residue (Q or T) that can be an H-bond donor similar\nto SARS-PLpro. Therefore, another residue must play this intermediate-stabilizing\nfunction in MERS-PLpro. Asparagine (N110) in SARS-PLpro is highly\nconserved among various coronavirus PLpro enzymes, and Ratia et al.\nsuggested that this residue could be another residue contributing\nto the oxyanion hole stabilization in addition to W107.21 From the structural alignment of the active\nsite, we noted that the N109 of MERS-PLpro overlaps with N110 of SARS-PLpro.\nThis suggested that N109, located above the catalytic cysteine, might\nbe the residue that plays this critical role in MERS-PLpro. We hypothesized\ntwo potential mechanisms: First, the side chain amine group of N109\ncould form an H-bond with the intermediate\u2019s oxyanion as an\nH-bond donor (Figure 7C). Alternatively, the\ncarbonyl group of N109 could bind to a water molecule, followed by\nthe water forming another H-bond with the negatively charged intermediate\n(Figure 7D). The positions of N109 in these\ntwo scenarios could differ. We generated two MERS-PLpro mutants, N109A\nand N109D, to investigate these two hypotheses. Enzyme activity of\nthe N109A mutant was completely abolished, while the N109D mutant\nexhibited only \u223c13.8% of the wild-type MERS-PLpro activity\n(Figure 7E). This indicates that the N109 residue\nis indeed crucial for stabilizing the intermediate for the enzyme\nto perform its catalytic function. If N109 stabilized the intermediate\nvia the second hypothesis, the side chain of N109D could still form\nan H-bond with a water molecule through the carbonyl group of aspartic\nacid, rescuing the MERS-PLpro enzyme activity. However, the N109D\nmutant also showed very low enzyme activity as compared to the wild-type,\nsuggesting that the second hypothesis is not likely to be the main\nstabilization mechanism. This result suggests that N109 is a critical\nresidue for intermediate stabilization, most likely through an H-bond\nformation with the side chain amine group of N109.\n\nIn addition to containing a crucial\nresidue that stabilizes the\noxyanion, the small loop (residues 101\u2013108) next to the active\nsite in SARS-PLpro is important for its catalytic activity via controlling\nactive site access. The hydrogen bond between D109 from this loop\nand W94 restrains the loop conformation, preventing it from moving\nto block active site access.21 These two\nresidues (D108 and W93 in MERS-PLpro) are conserved in MERS-PLpro,\nplaying the same role as that of SARS-PLpro (Figure 7B).\n\nSARS-CoV and MERS-CoV\ncause contagious and highly virulent infectious\ndiseases in humans, threatening public health.10,27 Both coronaviruses apparently originated from animal reservoirs\nsuch as bats or camels but surprisingly have rapidly evolved to human-to-human\ntransmission, although limited cases have been reported for MERS-CoV.11 SARS-CoV has been contained by public health\nmeasures since 2003, but MERS-CoV has spread into 12 different countries\nso far, and the numbers of infections continue to rise. There is currently\nno specific treatment or vaccine available.\n\nIn this study, we\ndetermined that none of the tested SARS-PLpro\nlead inhibitors were effective against MERS-PLpro. Thorough structural\ncomparison between these two PLpro enzymes using all available structures\nrevealed crucial structural differences, providing insights for developing\ninhibitors against PLpro. The overall MERS-PLpro structure is similar\nto that of SARS-PLpro including the N-terminal Ubl-domain. However,\nthe flexible BL2 loop of MERS-PLpro differs significantly from that\nof SARS-PLpro, which raised the possibility of differing roles in\ninhibitor binding. This may explain the observation that all of the\ntested SARS-PLpro lead inhibitors were ineffective against MERS-PLpro.\nIt was surprising to discover that SARS-PLpro has a deubiquitinating\nfunction,21 and now it has been shown that\nMERS-PLpro also exhibits the same function.22,23 We determined the catalytic activity of MERS-PLpro in direct comparison\nwith that of SARS-PLpro. The catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of SARS-PLpro was\n\u223c45-fold higher (8.2 \u00d7 105 M\u20131 s\u20131) than that of MERS-PLpro (1.9 \u00d7 104 M\u20131 s\u20131). Although the\ndeubiquitinating activity of MERS-PLpro is lower than SARS-PLpro,\nit is still much more active than two closely related human homologues\nof PLpro, herpes-associated ubiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP) and\nubiquitin-specific protease 14 (USP14), which exhibit catalytic efficiencies\nof 2.2 \u00d7 103 M\u20131 s\u20131 and 107 M\u20131 s\u20131, respectively.40\n\nWe performed HTS of 25 000 compounds\nagainst both PLpro\nenzymes, and identified a dual noncovalent inhibitor that was active\nagainst both PLpro enzymes. Interestingly, this inhibitor was determined\nto be a competitive inhibitor against MERS-PLpro, whereas it was an\nallosteric inhibitor against SARS-PLpro. These results suggest that\ninhibitor recognition specificity of MERS-PLpro may differ from that\nof SARS-PLpro even though the overall structures of the whole protein\nand the catalytic sites are very similar. The most probable contributing\nfactor for inhibitor selectivity of these two PLpro enzymes could\nbe attributed to the structural differences of the BL2 loop.\n\nThe 25 000-compound\nLife Chemicals library was screened against the two PLpro cysteine\nproteases from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. All assays against SARS-PLpro\nwere done in duplicate, and those against MERS-PLpro were done in\na single pass in black 384-well plates (Matrix Technologies). The\nSARS-PLpro enzyme (20 nM final concentration) was prepared in an assay\nbuffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.01% Triton X-100 (v/v), 0.1 mg mL\u20131 BSA, and 2 mM GSH). The MERS-PLpro enzyme (400 nM\nfinal concentration) was prepared in the same assay buffer with 5\nmM DTT in place of 2 mM GSH. A total of 30 \u03bcL of enzyme solution\nwas dispensed into wells, and then 200 nL of 10 mM compounds (50 \u03bcM\nfinal concentrations) was added and incubated for 5 min. Enzyme reactions\nwere initiated with 10 \u03bcL of substrate Z-Arg-Leu-Arg-Gly-Gly-AMC\n(Bachem Bioscience; 50 \u03bcM and 75 \u03bcM for SARS- and MERS-PLpro,\nrespectively) dissolved in the assay buffer and incubated for 6 min,\nfollowed by adding 10 \u03bcL of 10% SDS (w/v) as a stop solution.\nFluorescence intensity was monitored at 360 nm (excitation) and 450\nnm (emission).\n\nCompound\nsolutions with a\nseries of increasing concentrations (0\u2013200 \u03bcM at 1.5-fold\ndilution) were applied to all four channels at a 30 \u03bcL/min flow\nrate. Sensorgrams were analyzed using the Biacore T200 evaluation\nsoftware 2.0, and response units were measured during the equilibration\nphase at each concentration. Each PLpro enzyme was immobilized on\na CM5 sensor chip using standard amine-coupling with running buffer\nHBS-P (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% surfactant P-20, pH 7.4) using\na Biacore T200 instrument. The MERS-PLpro enzyme was immobilized to\nflow channels 2 and 3, and immobilization levels of flow channels\n2 and 3 were \u223c16 900 RU and \u223c16 700 RU,\nrespectively. SARS-PLpro was immobilized to flow channel 4 at the\nimmobilization level of \u223c14 600 RU to be compared with\nMERS-PLpro. Data were referenced with blank (enthanolamine) RU values.\nSigmaPlot 12.0 was used to fit the data to a single rectangular hyperbolic\ncurve to determine KD values. The hyperbolic, y = ymax\u00b7x/(KD + x), was used\nto plot response units and corresponding concentration, where y is the response, ymax is the\nmaximum response, and x is the compound concentration.\n\nEnzyme activities of both MERS-PLpro\nand SARS-PLpro were monitored in the same way as the primary screen\nwith varying concentrations of inhibitors and substrates (0\u2013300\n\u03bcM). The concentration of compounds was varied from 0 to at\nleast 10\u00d7 the IC50 value of each compound. The data\nwere fit to four equations (shown in SI Materials\nand Methods) using SigmaPlot Enzyme Kinetics Module 1.3 in\norder to determine the best fit inhibition mechanism and kinetic parameters\nfor each compound.\n\nTo test\nfor selectivity,\ntwo human ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCH-L1 and UCH-L3) and\ntwo unrelated enzymes (Hepatitis C Virus NS3 serine protease and B. anthracis dihydroorotase) were tested with the top hit\ncompound from HTS and a lead SARS-PLpro inhibitor (I-1) using a fluorometric assay. The fluorogenic substrate used in this\nstudy was ubiquitin-AMC (Boston Biochem). All assays were performed\nin 384-well black plates (Corning) in a total volume of 24 \u03bcL\nof the assay buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mM DTT, 0.1\nmg mL\u20131 BSA, and 0.01% Triton X-100 (v/v) in triplicate.\nA series of compound concentrations (0 to 200 \u03bcM final concentration\nat 2-fold serial dilution) in 100% DMSO was prepared in a 384-well\nplate. Then 3\u00d7 compound solutions were prepared in the assay\nbuffer prior to assays. A total of 8 \u03bcL of each enzyme solution\nwas distributed into wells, and 8 \u03bcL of varying concentrations\nof compounds was added and incubated for 10 min. The enzyme reaction\nwas initiated by adding 8 \u03bcL of the substrate (50 \u03bcM final\nconcentration), and fluorescence intensity was continuously monitored\nat excitation/emission wavelengths of 350 nm/460 nm for 10 min.\n\nData were collected at the LS-CAT end station 21-ID-F at the Advanced\nPhoton Source, Argonne National Laboratory, using a wavelength of\n\u03bb = 0.97872 \u00c5, and the crystal at 100 K under a dry liquid\nnitrogen stream. Data were recorded by a MAR CCD 225 mm detector with\nan oscillation angle of 1.0\u00b0 using a total of 190 frames. Data\nwere processed and scaled by XDS.41 The\ncrystal space group belonged to C2, containing one monomer in the\nasymmetric unit. The Matthews coefficient (VM) was calculated as 2.5, and solvent content was estimated\nto be 50%. Molecular replacement was carried out using Phaser42 from the CCP4 package. The SARS-PLpro crystal\nstructure (2FE8)21 was used as a search\nmodel. The zinc binding domain in the initial model was truncated\nand manually rebuilt by Coot.43 Structural\nrefinement was conducted using Refmac5.5.44"}
