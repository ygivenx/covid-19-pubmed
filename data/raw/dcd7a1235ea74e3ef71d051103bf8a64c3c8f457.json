{"title": "The lockdown of Hubei Province causing different transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan and", "body": "A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) appeared in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei 33 Province in central China had triggered city closure on Jan. 23, 2020, and lockdown 34 of all major cities in the province a few days later (Fig. 1 ). At present, over 50 million 35 people are constrained locally. Due to the threat of 2019-nCoV to public health, World 36\n\nHealth Organization (WHO) declared novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak to be 37 \"public health emergency of international concern\" on Jan. 30, 2020 [1] 38\n\nIt is always a great challenge to fight effectively against a pandemic [2, 3] , 39 especially when little is known about the new virus [4] . Ideally, governments, 40 communities and medical services take rapid, effective, rational, and proportionate 41 responses to such health emergencies; either minimalist or maximalist responses may 42 potentially be very harmful [5, 6] . 43\n\nTo facilitate decision making against the 2019-nCoV, researchers had predicted 44 the transmission dynamics in different scenarios. Read et al. [7] estimated that only 45 5.1% (95% CI, 4.8-5.5) of infections in Wuhan were identified; ahead of 14 days, 46 they predicted the number of infected people in Wuhan to be greater than 250 47 thousand on Feb. 4, 2020. Read et al. [7] suggested, before the city closure of Wuhan, 48 that travel restrictions from and to Wuhan city are unlikely to be effective and 2019-49 nCoV would outbreak in Beijing, Shanghai, etc. with much larger sizes. Leung et al. 50 [8] estimated the transmission dynamics of 2019-nCoV in six major cities in China 51 under six scenarios: 0%, 25%, 50% transmission reduction with and without 50% 52 mobility reduction. However, the assumption of 50% mobility reduction is much 53 lower than the real situation. China government enforced tourism ban on Jan. 24, and 54 carried out other control measures such as extending holidays, closing schools, 55 cancelling meetings, suggesting a 14-day quarantine after travel. In particular, 56 highway traffic control is strictly implemented in many cities, towns, and villages. 57\n\nThe majority of communities in large cities such as Beijing and Shanghai have closed 58 to visitors. 59\n\nUnder the circumstance of strict control measures, we forecast the transmission 60 dynamics of Wuhan and Beijing. Wuhan is the source of 2019-nCoV, suffered a long 61 history (two months) of virus transmission, with lack of medical resources to 62 quarantine exposed and suspect people. Beijing is a larger city with 22 million 63 residents, including 10 million inbound passengers after the holidays of Chinese New 64\n\nYear. We believe our estimation is close to the real situation and is helpful for 2019-65 nCoV control. 66 \n\nWe used the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model to estimate the 71 dynamics of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 72\n\nThe SEIR model has the form [9]: 74 .

For the cities with continuous imported infected people, we modify the growth 87 rate of infectious population as: 88\n\nwhere imported is the daily number of imported infections. 90\n\nThe basic reproductive number R0 for 2019-nCoV had been estimated in several 92 independent studies (Table 1 ). It was noticed that changes in reporting rate of 93 confirmed cases substantially affected R0 estimation [11] . In fact, R0 is highly 94 .

To make our analysis repeatable, we posted the data used in this study and R 112 code for the SEIR model at https://github.com/Xinhai-Li/2019-nCoV. 113\n\nUntil 9:00 on Feb. 9, the number of confirmed cases reaches 37251 115 (https://voice.baidu.com/act/newpneumonia/newpneumonia/?from=osari_pc_1).

For Wuhan, 125 we first fit the number of confirmed cases (Fig. 3A) , where the R0 is 5.75, much 126 higher than that in most studies yet lower than Tang et al.'s result (Table 1) imported patients from Jan. 19 to Feb. 8, which is 3.67. We adopted this uncertainty 147 to run 200 simulation, and found the R0 1.4 is the perfect fit (Fig. 4A) . Considering 148 the strict community locking (close to any visitors) and other extreme control 149 measures (such as office building control, i.e. checking body temperature for every 150 one and refusing visitors) in Beijing, we adopted a lower R0 1.2 after the first 30 days 151 of transmission. The uncertainty of R0 was simulated with CV = 15% (see Table 1 ), 152 and the results indicate that the infectious population may reach 607\u00b1553 on March 153 20\u00b116 (Fig. 4B) . The uncertainty of the transmission dynamics, as simulated by the 154 SEIR model, is very high due to large variance in imported cases and R0 (Fig. 4) . 155 .
