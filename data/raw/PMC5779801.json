{"title": "The use of masks and respirators to prevent transmission of influenza: a systematic review of the scientific evidence", "body": "Personal protective equipment to help reduce transmission of influenza is generally advised according to the risk of exposure to the influenza virus and the degree of infectivity and human pathogenicity of the virus. The paucity of scientific evidence upon which to base guidance for the use of masks and respirators in healthcare and community settings has been a particularly vexing issue for policymakers.\n\nThe Health Protection Agency (HPA) undertook a scientific evidence\u2010based review of the use of masks and respirators in an influenza pandemic to inform relevant guidance following the emergence of pandemic A (H1N1) 2009 influenza. The Department of Health commissioned the HPA to update the review in support of the revision of the United Kingdom (UK) influenza pandemic preparedness strategy.\n1\n The review was published on\u2010line at: http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/documents/digitalasset/dh_125425.pdf. A further update of the evidence base subsequently was performed in January 2011 and described herein.\n\nWe generally followed the approach detailed in the University of York\u2019s Systematic Reviews: CRD\u2019s Guidance for Undertaking Reviews in Health Care.\n2\n\n\n\nThe original search of the PubMed database was conducted on 7 November 2009; subsequent updates of the PubMed database search were undertaken on 23 June 2010 and 12 January 2011.\n1\n The November 2009 search also included the following scientific databases: Bandolier, the Cochrane Library Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, the Health Technology Assessment database, the National Health Service (NHS) Economic Evaluation database, the UK Database of Uncertainties about the Effects of Treatments, the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature.\n2\n No additional publications resulted from these databases. The initial search in November 2009 had no time period restrictions.\n\nA limited effort was made to identify additional studies: reference lists of review articles were examined; the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control\u2019s (ECDC) Antimicrobial Resistance and Health Care Associated Infection Programme was consulted; and MEC\u2019s and AN\u2019s hardcopy literature files were hand\u2010searched.\n\nWe included the following types of studies listed in the hierarchical order of study design quality: randomised controlled trials (i.e. randomised cross\u2010over trial and cluster randomised trial); quasi\u2010experimental studies (i.e. non\u2010randomised controlled study, before\u2010and\u2010after study and interrupted time series); and observational studies (cohort study and case\u2013control study). Only human studies published in English which had an abstract were included (Table 1).\n\nInfection with pandemic strains, seasonal influenza A or B viruses and zoonotic viruses such as swine or avian influenza were included because mask/respirator guidance is needed for all types of influenza. Studies that evaluated the effect of masks/respirators on transmission of other respiratory viruses were included as a proxy for influenza.\n\nA two\u2010stage selection process was used to identify studies that appeared to meet the inclusion criteria. Firstly, Fb\u2010R or VLC scanned and excluded papers on the basis of the \u2018title\u2019 for relevance; in the second and third searches, some relevant titles were excluded because they had been selected for review during a prior search. Secondly, to enhance the reliability of the selection process, Fb\u2010R, VLC, MEC and AN independently reviewed the abstracts for the remaining papers.\n\nFb\u2010R or VLC used a pre\u2010designed form to perform an initial data extraction of the full article and make an initial determination regarding its eligibility. MEC or AN subsequently reviewed all of the papers, supplemented Fb\u2010R\u2019s and VLC\u2019s initial abstraction as necessary and re\u2010assessed each paper for inclusion in the review. Any differences were resolved by mutual agreement. MEC and AN assessed the quality of the eligible studies using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tools\n3\n for randomised controlled trials, case\u2013control studies and cohort studies.\n\nThree of the randomised trials were hospital\u2010based studies,\n4\n, \n5\n, \n6\n and five were conducted in community settings.\n7\n, \n8\n, \n9\n, \n10\n, \n11\n Two of these studies compared N95 respirators (designed to seal tightly to the wearer\u2019s face and filter out very small particles or aerosols that may contain viruses) and surgical masks (used to block large droplets from coming into contact with the wearer\u2019s mouth or nose) amongst healthcare workers; one trial found a lower rate of clinical respiratory illness associated with the use of non\u2010fit\u2010tested N95 respirators compared with medical masks,\n6\n whilst a non\u2010inferiority trial found that masks and respirators offered similar protection to nurses against laboratory\u2010confirmed influenza infection.\n5\n A trial conducted amongst crowded, urban households found that, despite poor compliance, mask wearing coupled with hand sanitiser use, reduced secondary transmission of upper respiratory infection/influenza\u2010like illness/laboratory\u2010confirmed influenza compared with education; hand sanitiser alone resulted in no reduction in this aggregated outcome.\n11\n\n\n\nAlthough the remaining five trials found no significant differences between control and intervention groups, there were some notable findings. Household contacts who wore a P2 respirator (considered to have an equivalent rating to an N95 respirator) \u2018all\u2019 or \u2018most\u2019 of the time for the first 5 days were less likely to develop an influenza\u2010like illness compared with less frequent users in one study.\n9\n Another study found a significant reduction in laboratory\u2010confirmed influenza amongst household contacts that began hand hygiene or hand hygiene plus a mask within 36 hours of the index case\u2019s illness.\n8\n A trial conducted amongst resident university students detected significant reductions in influenza\u2010like illness during weeks 4\u20136 in the mask and hand hygiene group after adjusting for vaccine receipt and other potential confounders.\n10\n\n\n\nThe requirements for mask/respirator wearing and subsequent compliance varied by study (Table 2); for example, in MacIntyre\u2019s study of healthcare workers in China in December 2008 through January 2009\n6\n\u2018participants wore the mask or respirator on every shift for 4 consecutive weeks after being shown when to wear it\u2019, whilst nurses in Canada wore a mask or respirator during the 2008/09 influenza season when caring for patients with febrile respiratory illness and during aerosol\u2010generating procedures.\n5\n\n\n\nAll of the observational studies evaluated mask and respirator use following the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003;\n12\n, \n13\n, \n14\n, \n15\n, \n16\n, \n17\n, \n18\n, \n19\n, \n20\n seven studies were conducted amongst healthcare workers and two were community\u2010based. All but two\n12\n, \n13\n of the case\u2013control studies in healthcare workers reported that wearing masks and/or respirators appeared to protect workers from acquiring SARS.\n14\n, \n15\n, \n16\n, \n17\n A retrospective cohort study of nurses who worked in two Toronto hospital intensive care units found that the relative risk of SARS for nurses who consistently wore a N95 respirator was half that for nurses who consistently wore a surgical mask; however, the difference was not significant because of a small sample size.\n18\n\n\n\nNone of the studies we reviewed established a conclusive relationship between mask/respirator use and protection against influenza infection. Some useful clues, however, could be gleaned. Subanalyses performed for one of the larger randomised controlled studies in a household setting found evidence of reduced rates of influenza\u2010like illness if household contacts consistently wore the mask or respirator.\n9\n The authors of a randomised trial of mask plus alcohol\u2010based sanitiser and mask\u2010only group amongst U.S. university students living in residence halls noted that their study may have been better positioned to identify a protective effect because participants initiated the interventions at the beginning of the influenza season.\n10\n Cowling\u2019s\n8\n finding that there was a significant reduction in the secondary attack ratio if the hand hygiene and mask plus hand hygiene interventions were begun within 36 hours of the index case lends support to this hypothesis.\n\nAnticipating the paucity of studies that focused solely on influenza, we included the effect of masks/respirators on respiratory viruses other than influenza. Such studies have often been used to support infection control guidance for influenza. However, the difficulties in interpreting the observational studies of SARS suggest that they are of limited use for guiding policy on influenza. Firstly, SARS is an unusual acute viral respiratory infection with a very different epidemiology to almost all other respiratory viral infections. It is fundamentally different from human influenza: it rarely infects children, has a long incubation period, transmits little early on, mostly transmits in healthcare settings, is not prone to extensive global spread and has only appeared once. Secondly, the studies were poorly designed, had many weaknesses and so were very difficult to interpret. Issues of concern include the use of a non\u2010specific definition for exposure to a SARS patient (e.g. coming within one metre of a patient), inconsistency in providing information about the comparability of cases and controls and collection of data after a lengthy period following the outbreak. Several lacked microbiological confirmation of cases or controls and it would seem likely that a number of the SARS cases were not cases at all. Because all the cases knew they were cases, recall bias was highly likely. The single case\u2013control study that tried to address some of these limitations did not find that inconsistent use of masks or respirators was associated with SARS infection.\n13\n\n\n\nIt is important to note three considerations when assessing the practical implications of the review\u2019s findings. Firstly, development of evidence\u2010based guidance about mask/respirator use is inextricably linked to what is known about how influenza is spread and specific risk factors that can affect transmissibility (e.g. host factors, pathogen factors, environmental factors and particle size). However, this is an area equally fraught with uncertainty; there are limited and conflicting evidence regarding the relative importance and frequency of direct contact, indirect contact, droplet and aerosol modes of transmission.\n21\n, \n22\n Historically, transmission has been thought to occur principally through respiratory droplets and masks have been used as a barrier against droplets emitted by coughing and sneezing. In the last decade, there has been increasing interest in a possible role for aerosol transmission of influenza and the advisability of filtering respirators to block such transmission. For example, studies have found that infected patients can produce aerosol particles containing influenza virus\n23\n and that hospital airflow patterns can influence influenza transmission via aerosols.\n24\n\n\n\nSecondly, although the focus of this review has been on masks and respirators, limiting transmission of influenza in both healthcare and community settings requires a multifaceted approach, of which masks and respirators are but one component. In the healthcare setting, this \u2018hierarchy of controls\u2019 includes administrative controls help to reduce the introduction and spread of infection (e.g. policies to restrict entrance of ill visitors and workers, vaccination of healthcare workers); environmental/ engineering controls (e.g. adequate ventilation); and lastly, use of personal protective equipment and hand hygiene.\n25\n In the community setting, a similarly structured approach is advised. However, during both the planning for an eventual pandemic and the subsequent public health response to the H1N1 pandemic, concern over policy and guidance related to mask/respirator use has at times seemed to overshadow other important controls.\n26\n It is somewhat paradoxical that whilst continued effort and resources are needed to assess the independent effect of masks and respirators on influenza transmission, their use would always be recommended in combination with other control measures.\n\nThirdly the practical implications of policy, guidance and recommendations on mask/respirator use and other infection control measures must be considered. The only two studies that compared mask and respirators to protect healthcare workers from influenza infection essentially reached different conclusions\n5\n, \n6\n illustrating the difficulties facing policymakers.\n27\n Further, a simulation study found that strict adherence to guidance about personal protective equipment (which included masks and respirators) compromised normal ward functioning in a UK hospital setting.\n28\n\n\n\nThis review had a prescribed narrow focus that permitted us to examine a relatively small number of studies. We considered employing quantitative techniques, but on analysis found the studies comprised a range of study designs, pathogens, participants, interventions and opportunities for bias and confounding would render any meta\u2010analysis findings open to criticism. A review that included interventions other than mask/respirator use, experimental laboratory and/animal\u2013human studies on mask/respirator efficacy, cost\u2010effectiveness studies and the occurrence of adverse events would present a more comprehensive picture.\n\nSeveral systematic reviews of interventions to limit the transmission of respiratory viral infections and/or specifically influenza have been undertaken. Most have considered a range of interventions;\n29\n, \n30\n, \n31\n, \n32\n, \n33\n one focused specifically on respiratory protection.\n34\n Within the boundaries established by our inclusion criteria, our search strategy captured essentially the same studies on masks and respirators that others have identified. Jefferson et al derived pooled estimates of the effectiveness of wearing an N95 respirator (91%) and wearing a mask (68%) for any respiratory viral infection;\n29\n however, these estimates were derived from the analyses of six SARS studies whose methodology was problematic. We carefully noted how well exposures in various studies were detailed and if cases and controls were laboratory\u2010confirmed to avoid misclassification bias. We did not feel that such a heterogeneous group of studies could be combined even for SARS.\n\nIn conclusion, there is a limited evidence base to support the use of masks and/or respirators in healthcare or community settings. Mask use is best undertaken as part of a package of personal protection, especially including hand hygiene in both home and healthcare settings. Early initiation and correct and consistent wearing of masks/respirators may improve their effectiveness. However, this remains a major challenge \u2013 both in the context of a formal study and in everyday practice.\n\nContinued research on the effectiveness masks/respirators use and other closely associated considerations remains an urgent priority with emphasis being on carefully designed observational studies and trials best conducted outside a crisis situation.\n35\n However, examination of the literature has highlighted that well\u2010designed studies in this field are challenging.\n27\n Studies need to be adequately powered to assess potentially small differences between interventions and the independent effect of mask/respirator wearing when a second intervention (e.g. hand hygiene) is employed; an appropriate control group must be identified (e.g. no use of masks/respirators). Most of the studies we examined were too small to reliably detect what would be anticipated to be moderate effects. Perhaps, one solution is to fund large multi\u2010centre trials with similar protocols in different sites for multiple years to achieve sufficient power. Protocols should include the collection of detailed exposure data, objective monitoring of compliance and assessment of potential confounders. It may be difficult to design studies employing a control group that does not use any protective equipment (including masks/respirators), particularly in healthcare settings, as such precautions are routinely recommended. Finally, there is a striking paucity of published studies with microbiologically proven influenza infection as an outcome; inclusion of laboratory outcomes is essential in any future study of masks/respirators on transmission of influenza.\n\nSupported by funding from the Health Protection Agency and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\n\nMary E Chamberland provided assistance to the Health Protection Agency, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization in the development of infection control recommendations for pandemic influenza.
