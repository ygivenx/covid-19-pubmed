{"title": "Herpesvirus infection reduces Pol II occupancy of host promoters but spares", "body": "Regulating messenger RNA (mRNA) abundance is of central importance during both 43 cellular homeostasis and disease. While it is intuitive that transcriptional changes in the nucleus 44 impact RNA levels in the cytoplasm, evidence in both yeast and mammalian cells now indicates 45 that the converse is also true: altered cytoplasmic mRNA decay rates can broadly impact 46 transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). In yeast, stabilizing the cytoplasmic mRNA pool by 47 (ChIP-seq) in mock versus MHV68 infected MC57G mouse fibroblasts at 24 hours post 96 infection (hpi). As a control, we also infected cells with a version of MHV68 containing the 97 point mutation R443I in the viral muSOX endonuclease gene, which reduces its mRNA cleavage 98 activity. R443I retains a similar lytic cycle and infectious capability to wildtype (WT) MHV68 in 99 vivo and in vitro its infectious capability is similar to MHV68 in mouse fibroblasts (6,23). 100\n\nMHV68-infected cells displayed promoter-proximal loss of Pol II at 86% of loci compared to 101 mock-infected cells, averaged across two biological replicates and subtracting input signal (Fig 102 1A and S1 Fig A) . Loss of Pol II occupancy was primarily due to muSOX-induced mRNA 103 decay, as this signal loss either did not occur or was reduced at 67% of these loci during 104 infection with R443I MHV68 (Fig 1A and S1 Fig A) . Sixty-three genes, or 1.3% of loci, showed 105\n\nhigher Pol II occupancy in WT infection as compared to mock infection, although these did not 106 share any common GO terms (S1 Table) . A representative genome browser view shows reduced 107\n\nPol II signal throughout Srsf2 in the MHV68 condition of two replicate ChIP experiments. We 108 independently validated the ChIP-seq results by ChIP-qPCR at the Rplp0 and Fus promoters, 109 both of which showed a significant reduction of Pol II occupancy in cells infected with WT but 110 not R443I MHV68 (Fig 1C) , as did a validation using a second antibody that recognizes the N-111 terminus of the major subunit of Pol II, Rpb1 (Fig1D). The genome-wide reduction in poised Pol 112 II in WT but not R443I infected cells was also evident when the sequencing reads from positions 113 -2000 to +4000 around the transcription start sites (TSS) were plotted as a histogram (Fig 1G and  114   S1 Fig B) . The variability between replicates in R443I recovery (Fig 1B) is likely due to 115 differences in the extent of host shutoff reduction between replicates due to R443I reducing 116 muSOX activity while not being a catalytic mutant. 117\n\nTo assess the stage of transcription impacted by RNA decay, we compared the amount of 118\n\nPol II in promoter regions (-50 to +200) and the amount of Pol II in gene bodies (+200 to +5000) 119 between mock and infected samples. Consistent with the above analyses, MHV68 infected cells 120 contained markedly less promoter proximal Pol II than uninfected cells, and this signal was 121 partially recovered in the R443I infection ( Fig 1E) . Genes with impaired Pol II promoter binding 122 during MHV68 infection also had less Pol II within the gene body compared to mock infected 123 cells, which again was not observed during R443I infection ( Fig 1F) . Notably, the difference in 124 regression line slopes between MHV68 and mock infected cells was clearly more marked when 125 comparing Pol II promoter occupancy, suggesting that the primary transcriptional defect is at the 126 stage of initiation. This is consistent with data from previous studies that found no defect in 127 serine 2 phosphorylation of elongating Pol II and no consistent change to Pol II elongation 128 during MHV68 infection (22, 24) . 129\n\nFinally, to assess if RNA decay affected transcription termination, we plotted sequencing 130 reads between 1kb upstream and 1kb downstream of the transcription termination site (TTS) as a 131 histogram ( Fig 1H and S1 Fig D) . TTS The average Pol II  140  7   signature across 82 viral ORFs between -500 and +500 around the TSS was comparable in cells  141 infected with WT or R443I MHV68, with a slightly higher signal in the R443I infection ( Fig  142   2A ). Indeed, there was a robust and widespread Pol II signal in both infection conditions across 143 the viral genome ( Fig 2B) . Thus, herpesviral genes appear to escape mRNA decay-induced 144 transcriptional repression. 145\n\nIn contrast to host genes, we did not observe peaks of promoter-proximal Pol II on the 146 viral genome in our ChIP-seq data (Fig 2A and B We then tested whether viral promoter sequence elements were sufficient to enable 177 escape by querying whether they conferred resistance to transcriptional repression upon 178 relocation from the viral genome into the host DNA. We inserted the MHV68 late promoter M7 179 or the KSHV LANA promoter upstream of a puromycin resistance cassette into 293T cell 180 chromatin using either lentiviral transduction or random plasmid DNA integration, respectively. 181\n\nWe induced mRNA decay and host transcriptional repression in these cells by expression of 182 MHV68 muSOX or the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) endonuclease vhs. Similar to the 183 host promoters Gapdh and Rplp0, Pol II recruitment to both integrated viral promoters was 184 repressed upon infection with MHV68 but not with R443I (Fig 4A and 5B) .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/585984 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nTo confirm that viral promoters integrated into the host genome were also repressed in 186 the context of infection, we infected MC57G cells containing an integrated MHV68 M4 187 promoter-driven puromycin cassette with MHV68. Indeed, the M4 promoter was repressed to a 188 similar degree as host Fus and Rplp0 promoters during infection with WT MHV68 but not the 189 mRNA decay-deficient MHV68 R443I (Fig 4C) . In summary, these data argue against the promoter is strongly repressed during muSOX-induced mRNA decay. This is seen by 4SU 202 incorporation measuring nascent RNA production -similar to the control ActB gene -and by Pol 203 II recruitment, similar to the control Fus and Rplp0 promoters (Fig 5A and B) . However, in the 204 context of the replicating MHV68 genome, the CMV-GFP promoter had a Pol II ChIP-seq signal 205 during both MHV68 WT and R443I infection that was not markedly different from several other 206 viral genes (ORFs 4, 25, 48, 52, 72, M11) ( Fig 5C) . 207 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/585984 doi: bioRxiv preprint Finally, we evaluated whether the lytic stage of infection was necessary to confer escape 208 from transcriptional repression, or whether some other feature of the non-replicating viral 209 genome was important. To this end, we examined Pol II occupancy at promoters of several genes 210 expressed from the KSHV genome during latent infection in 293T cells, when the viral DNA is 211 maintained as an episome but not amplified in replication compartments. Latent infection does 212 not promote mRNA turnover, and thus we transfected muSOX into these cells to stimulate 213 mRNA turnover in the absence of lytic replication. Similar to the host genes Gapdh and Rplp0, 214\n\nwe observed an RNA decay-induced repression of Pol II occupancy at the latent viral promoter 215 LANA while the viral K1 promoter was repressed in 4 out of 5 experiments ( Fig 5D) . We also 216 observed repression of the human Ef1a promoter, which is present on the KSHV viral episome 217 as a driver of the GFP reporter gene (Fig 5D) . In sum, these observations indicate that the viral 218 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/585984 doi: bioRxiv preprint context and replication state, rather than promoter sequence, in determining the transcriptional 230 response to accelerated mRNA decay. 231\n\nAcross the host genome, Pol II appears to be most strongly affected at the stage of 232 recruitment. The reduction in promoter-proximal Pol II is propagated into the gene body, 233 although the differences there were less pronounced, suggesting that once transcription of a gene 234 initiates there are not subsequent blocks to elongation. This agrees with prior studies of 235 individual host loci in MHV68 infected or muSOX expressing cells (22,24). The population of 236\n\nPol II that is promoter-proximal and measured during a ChIP experiment has been shown to 237 comprise a combination of actively engaged Pol II as well as Pol II transiently binding to the 238 DNA. Thus, a large reduction in promoter-proximal Pol II may not be expected to be borne out 239 in the gene body (32). Additionally, the antibody we use in this study binds with higher affinity 240 to hypophosphorylated Pol II(33), likely affecting our ability to pull down elongating and 241 phosphorylated forms of Pol II. We also did not observe a defect in transcription termination, or 242 evidence of polymerases on the DNA after TTSs, suggesting that the gammaherpesvirus MHV68 243 does not induce the termination defect and run-on transcription of host genes recently described 244 in HSV-1 (34). 245\n\nTwo pieces of evidence indicate that reduction of Pol II at host genes is unlikely due to 246 sequestration of or competition for the transcription machinery by the viral DNA. First, infection 247 with the mRNA decay mutant virus R443I, which replicates its viral genome to WT levels (6), 248 does not induce the widespread reduction in Pol II recruitment to host promoters. Second, 249 transfection of muSOX alone (or other broad acting viral endonucleases) in the absence of viral 250 infection is sufficient to induce transcriptional repression at host promoters. Therefore, we 251 instead favor the hypothesis that one or more cellular proteins released from degrading mRNA 252 .

We hypothesize that the ability to escape 300 from transcriptional repression is linked to the open conformation of viral DNA in replication 301 compartments, and that this helps these viruses counteract decay-induced viral transcript loss. 302\n\nWhile widespread mRNA decay has been shown to facilitate immune evasion, gene expression 303 control, and latency establishment, the robust viral transcription we document here presents a 304 parsimonious explanation for a novel way in which the virus benefits from accelerated decay. buffer. Samples were eluted twice with 100 \u00b5L 5% Beta-mercaptoethanol (BME) in DEPC H20 358 for 5 min then RNA was precipitated with isopropanol and quantified by RT-qPCR. 359\n\nThe WT and R443I MHV68 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) were previously 361 described (6,50). MHV68 was produced by first making p0 virus by transfecting NIH 3T3 cells 362 in 6-well plates with 2.5 \u00b5g BAC DNA using TransIT-X2 (Mirus Bio) for 24h. Five to seven 363 days later, the cells were split into a 10 cm dish, then harvested and frozen. After 5-7 days the 364 majority of cells showed cytopathic effect (CPE). 30 \u00b5L of p0 was then added per confluent 10 365 cm dish of NIH 3T12 cells, split 2 days later into four 10 cm dishes and harvested 4-6 days later 366 when all cells were infected. Cells were collected by centrifugation (5 min, 1500 rpm) and the 367 .

Reads were 437 mapped to that index using Bowtie2 (2.3.0). 438\n\nTo visualize reads in the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV), tdf files were made from 439 bam files and indexes made from those bam files. To make tdf files for the viral genome, a 440 chrom.size file was created for MHV68 and then the count command was run. Analysis of 441 mapped reads was performed with HOMER (Hypergeometric Optimization of Motif 442 EnRichment) (52). Tag directories were created from the bam files generated from Bowtie with 443 the makeTagDirectory command. This was done separately for the mouse and MHV68 genomes. 444\n\nFor mouse genes, the analyzeRepeats command was used to look at tag density in the body of 445 genes and the -c pausing option was used to compare pausing ratios. annotatePeaks was run in 446 both the -hist and -ghist mode to assess composite Pol II occupancy across the mouse genome as 447 well as individual gene occupancy. 448 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.
