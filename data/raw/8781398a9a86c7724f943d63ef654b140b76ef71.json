{"title": "Scientific name", "body": "Domestic or European ferrets are carnivorous mammals related to weasels, minks, otters and skunks. They have long bodies, short legs and thick fur with various color patterns. The natural pattern, called sable or fitch, features a yellowish coat with dark patches over the limbs and tail, a facial mask and dark brown eyes. Ferrets have anal scent glands and sebaceous glands but lack sweat glands and hence are particularly susceptible to heat 1 . Adult males weigh ~2 kg, whereas females are smaller at ~1 kg. Ferrets live for roughly 6-8 years.\n\nFerrets have been used as research models since the early 1900s (ref. 2). They are hardy animals that thrive in the lab, provided that their social behaviors, diet and other habits, such as their inclination to burrow and hide, are accommodated.\n\nDespite a relatively small representation in the laboratory, ferrets have a distinct niche in biomedical research. Their tracheal and lung anatomies, which, like their narrow, elongated bodies and short legs, are adapted for burrowing, afford decreased airway resistance and a relatively large lung capacity that facilitate respiratory research. Because lung morphology is similar between ferrets and humans, ferrets are used in the study of cystic fibrosis 3 .\n\nIn addition to having similar respiratory anatomy, ferrets are also susceptible to respiratory diseases that affect humans (notably, influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated corona virus) and often show clinical signs similar to those observed in humans. Influenza research has become especially important in recent years owing to the emergence of highly pathogenic strains of influenza that are global health threats. Ferrets are the model of choice for developing influenza vaccines and therapeutics 4 .\n\nFerrets are also used to model human gastrointestinal disease, again because of their anatomical and physiological similarities "}
